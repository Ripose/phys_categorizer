We report on a new lass of eletromagnetially-driven (cid:29)uid interfae instability. Using the

optial radiation pressure of a w laser to bend a very soft near-ritial liquid-liquid interfae, we

show that it beomes unstable for su(cid:30)iently large beam power P , leading to the formation of

a stationary beam-entered liquid miro-jet. We explore the behavior of the instability onset by

tuning the interfae softness with temperature and varying the size of the exiting beam. The

instability mehanism is experimentally demonstrated. It simply relies on total re(cid:29)etion of light

at the deformed interfae whose ondition provides the universal saling relation for the onset PS

of the instability.

Deformations and break-up of (cid:29)uid interfaes under an applied (cid:28)eld play a signi(cid:28)ant

role in sienti(cid:28) and tehnologi endeavors. Sine the early works of Zeleny [1℄ and further

investigations of Taylor [2℄, interfae instabilities driven by eletri (cid:28)elds are the most famil-

iar examples. They represent nowadays the orner stone of numerous industrial proesses

as di(cid:27)erent as eletro-spraying [3℄, eletrospinning of polymer (cid:28)bers [4℄ or surfae relief pat-

terning [5℄. From the fundamental point of view they also illustrate a simple and fasinating

example of behavior leading to (cid:28)nite time singularity [6℄. A uniform magneti (cid:28)eld an as

well destabilize (cid:29)uid interfaes and form well-organized peak strutures [7℄ or elongate mag-

neti droplets [8℄, though no liquid ejetion ours in that ase. These deformations, as well

as those driven by the aousti radiation pressure [9℄, were essentially used to haraterize

in a non ontat manner, the mehanial properties of (cid:29)uid interfaes [10, 11℄.

Reently, with the inreasing importane of optial

fores in emerging nano/bio-

tehnologies, this strategy has been suessfully extended to the optial deformation of

soft materials or miro-ob jets and brought new insights into their visoelasti properties

[12, 13, 14℄. However, as the bending of (cid:29)uid surfaes by the optial radiation pressure is

usually weak, further developments require larger beam intensities with smaller disturbing

e(cid:27)ets. Interfae disruption under the applied (cid:28)eld ould onstitute a ma jor drawbak for

this promising method and should therefore be investigated. Yet, even if non linear elonga-

tions of red blood ells [13℄ and droplets disruption [15℄ were already shown, to the best of

our knowledge interfae instability driven by the optial radiation pressure has never been

observed nor disussed in detail.

Using very soft transparent liquid interfaes to enhane optial radiation pressure e(cid:27)ets,

we show in the present Letter that, ontrary to expetations, the hump indued by a on-

tinuous laser wave beomes unstable for su(cid:30)iently large beam powers. To analyze this new

opto-hydrodynami instability, we explore the universal behavior of its onset on near-ritial

liquid-liquid interfaes by varying the interfae softness with a temperature sanning, and

by hanging the size of the exiting beam. When properly resaled, the dispersion in mea-

sured onsets redues to a single master behavior whih is retrieved theoretially from simple

arguments. In fat we demonstrate that the total re(cid:29)etion ondition of light at the inter-

fae de(cid:28)nes an onset in power whih agrees with the observed saling law. Finally we show

that the optially-driven interfae instability leads to the formation of a stationary beam-

entered liquid miro-jet emitting droplets, whih antiipates the bases for new appliations

Experiments.(cid:22)Opto-hydrodynami instabilities of (cid:29)uid interfaes are realized in a qua-

ternary liquid mixture made of toluene, sodium dodeyl sulfate (SDS), n-butanol and water.

At room temperature we prepare a water-in-oil miellar phase of miroemulsion whose om-

position in weight fration is 70 % toluene, 4 % SDS, 17% n-butanol and 9% water. Close

to TC , where TC = 35◦C is the liquid-liquid ritial temperature, the mixture belongs to the

universality lass (d=3,n=1) of the Ising model [16℄. For a temperature T > TC it separates

in two miellar phases of di(cid:27)erent onentrations Φ1 and Φ2 . The use of these mixtures was

motivated by the fat that signi(cid:28)ant interfae deformations by optial radiation, without

nonlinear propagation e(cid:27)et or disturbing thermal oupling [16℄, require weak surfae tension

and buoyany. Indeed both e(cid:27)ets vanishes when the ritial point is neared respetively

with the ritial exponents 2ν = 1.26 and β = 0.325. Then the surfae tension σ of phase-
separated supramoleular liquids is intrinsially small. For example from σ = σ0( T

where σ0 = 1.04 10−

The experimental on(cid:28)guration is shematially presented in Fig. 1a. The mixture

is enlosed in a fused-quartz ell of path length l=2 mm that is thermally-ontrolled at

the temperature T above TC (temperature auray: ∆T 6 0.05K ). Sine density (resp.

index of refration) of water is larger (resp.

Φ1 . The beam is foused on the interfae by a 10X mirosope lens to ensure a ylindrial

symmetry of the intensity pro(cid:28)le around the menisus. We adjust also the beam-waist ω0

by hanging the distane between a (cid:28)rst lens (foal length f=1 m) and the 10X ob jetive.

As already demonstrated, the optial radiation pressure originates from light momentum

disontinuity at the interfae.

It always pushes normally to this interfae the (cid:29)uid with

larger refrative index into that with smaller refrative index, regardless of the diretion of

propagation [17℄. As a result, radiation pressure ats downwards in our ase (see Fig. 1), and

instability ours even more rapidly (PS = 370 mW ) when the ritial point is neared

Consequently, sine PS vary notieably in the range of Bo investigated, we analyzed its

behavior over large variations in ω0 and (T

order of magnitude in (T

TC ), PS varies linearly versus ω0 : the instability onset dereases

ritial point is neared. This behavior is muh better illustrated in the Inset of Fig. 3 for

the smallest beam-waist used ω0 = 3.5µm. A power law (cid:28)t leads to PS ∝

Disussion.(cid:22) While interfae deformations do not depend on the diretion of propagation

at low laser exitations, this is no more true at higher (cid:28)eld strengths. Instead of a liquid

jet, huge tethered deformations are indued by an upward propagating beam, but they

remain always stable, despite surprising aspet ratios [20℄. A simple physial mehanism that

di(cid:27)erentiates both ases is the possibility to reah total-internal re(cid:29)etion when the beam

propagates from Φ2 to Φ1 , i.e. from the large to the low refrative index phase. Furthermore,

as it an be seen from Eq. (2), the transfer of momentum at the interfae is maximum under

total re(cid:29)etion ondition beause R = 1 and T = 0 in that ase. A omparison with the

momentum transfer at normal inidene shows that the radiation pressure is thus enhaned

by a fator (1 + n2

n1 )2

4 (n1 ≃

≃

n2 in our ase). This fator is obviously underestimated

beause seondary re(cid:29)etions and even self-guiding of light inside the deformation will also

ontribute to a further inrease. Then, let us express the total re(cid:29)etion ondition:

Sine experiments are realized in the Bo < 1 regime, buoyany does not play any important

role and an thus be negleted. On the other hand, we expand the expression of the radiation

pressure given by Eq. (2) to (cid:28)rst order in n2 −

n1 beause Φ2 and Φ1 are oexisting phases

of lose omposition due to the viinity of the ritial point. Eq. (1) beomes:

. Optohydrodynami interfae

instability is then learly triggered by the total re(cid:29)etion of the exiting beam inside the

indued deformation. Hene, the brightness of the liquid jets (see Fig. 1i,j) on(cid:28)rms that

they behave as liquid waveguides.

Finally, sine matter with large refrative index is always trapped in high beam intensity

regions by optial fores [21℄, the optial destabilization of liquid interfaes leads to the

formation of a stationary beam-entered jet whih eventually breaks into a spray of nearly

monodisperse droplets (Fig. 1i). Bearing in mind that our system has ultralow surfae

tension and that the density di(cid:27)erene between the phases is also weak, it an be alulated

that the radius of the indued jet is muh smaller than the typial size for whih (cid:29)utuation

e(cid:27)ets beome important for pinhing [22, 23, 24℄. The break-up mehanism, whih deserves

further investigation, is very robust and onvenient beause inlined jets an also be easily

reated by tilting the laser beam, as shown on Fig. 1j.

In onlusion, we have presented a new eletromagneti instability mehanism of (cid:29)uid

interfaes driven by the optial radiation pressure of a w laser wave.

It opens the way

to optial streaming of (cid:29)uid interfaes, even if laser pulses ould be neessary for sti(cid:27)er

interfaes [15℄. The stability of the resulting jet, as well as the regularity of the produed

miro-droplets, o(cid:27)ers also new perspetives for optial guiding of miro(cid:29)uidi (cid:29)ows.

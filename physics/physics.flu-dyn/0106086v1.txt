Edge waves along a sloping beach

We construct a family of explicit rotational solutions to the nonlinear governing equa-
tions for water waves, describing edge waves propagating over a plane-sloping beach.
A detailed analysis of the edge wave dynamics and of the run-up pattern is made
possible by the use of the Lagrangian approach to the water motion. A graphical
representation of the edge wave is also presented.

———————————————————————————————————

1 Introduction

Standing on a gently sloping straight beach, it is a matter of observation that
various waveforms propagate on the surface of the sea. Among these we ﬁnd edge
waves - water waves that progress along the shoreline. These waves, often diﬃcult to
visualize (this has, probably, prevented the regarding of this waveform as important
for a long time), are coastal trapped, i.e. their amplitude is maximal at the shoreline
and decays rapidly oﬀshore. They produce on the beach beautiful run-up patterns
(highest points reached by a wave on the beach). Although propagation is along the
straight shoreline and the waveform is sinusoidal in the longshore, these waves are not
one-dimensional (Lighthill 1978).

While they were originally considered to be a curiosity (Lamb 1932), edge waves
are now recognized to play a signiﬁcant role in nearshore hydrodynamics. For shallow
beaches empirical evidence shows that incident storm waves loose most of their energy
trough wave breaking by the time they reach the shore. After breaking oﬀshore, as
the waves progress to shallower water, their height decreases reaching its least value at
the shoreline. Since storms often result in pronounced shoreline erosion, the surf zone
water processes with the onset of a storm are dominated by wave conditions other than
the incident waves - role attributed by oceanographers to the edge waves ; see Komar
(1998). There are other instances when edge waves are of signiﬁcance. For example,
processed data from the water waves created by an earthquake occuring in April 1992
in the ocean ﬂoor near the Californian coast show that two distinct wave packets
(both directly generated in the nearshore by the vertical motion of the ocean bottom)

1

were recorded at a coastal station about 150 km far from the epicentre. At ﬁrst, less
than an hour after the occurence of the earthquake, relatively fast-moving swell with
amplitude around 15 cm striked from oﬀshore. About two hours after the swell has
subsided, relatively slow-moving edge waves with amplitudes around 50 cm (Boss et
al. 1995) arrived. Measurements performed on this occasion conﬁrm the rapid decay
of the amplitude of the edge waves: at an oﬀshore distance of 12 km the amplitude is
reduced to 10 % of its maximal value (attained at the shoreline). Let us also mention
that it has been observed (see Evans 1988) that hurricanes travelling approximately
parallel to a nearby coastline sometimes give rise to edge waves. Interestingly, edge
waves can in fact be generated directly in a laboratory wave tank (Yeh 1985).

The edge wave phenomenon has been extensively studied and discussed in the
mathematical literature within the framework of linear theory. Due to the small
displacements associated with these waves, the governing equations for water waves
or the shallow-water equations are linearized (Minzoni & Whitham 1977 showed that
both approximations are equally consistent) and this simpliﬁcation permits a thorough
analysis. We refer to Ehrenmark (1998) for an excellent up-to-date survey.

Despite the fact that the linearizing approximation lacks rigorous mathematical
justiﬁcation, it has been used with considerable success as a large variety of theoret-
ical studies are conﬁrmed in experimental contexts. The investigation of nonlinear
edge waves can be seen as a natural extension to the linear theory. Whitham (1976)
showed the existence of irrotational weakly nonlinear edge waves that propagate par-
allel to the shore using a formal Fourier series expansion for the full water-wave theory.
A study of properties of nonlinear progressive edge waves based on the fact that the
evolution is described by the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation was performed by Yeh
(1985). This paper describes an alternative approach; the main impetus for the results
reported here comes from the belief that the need for a more rigorous theory remains
thoroughly justiﬁed. A quest for an explicit edge wave solution for the governing
equations appears to be of interest since the structure of the edge waves obscures
their visual observation; moreover, a solution in closed mathematical form provides a
background against which certain features which have been observed (and predicted)
can be checked. It turns out that the deep water wave solution discovered by Gerstner
(1809), can be adapted to construct edge waves propagating along a plane-sloping
beach. This possibility was pointed out by Yih (1966) but the treatement therein, in
essence followed also by Mollo-Christensen (1982), provides only an implicit form for
the free water surface. We present a procedure by which exact edge wave solutions to
the full water-wave equations are obtained. The closed form of the solution in Lagra-
gian (material) coordinates permits us to provide clear illustrations of the structure of
these edge waves. From an examination of the solution we also obtain the run-up pat-
tern, an attractive feature being the occurence of cusps - these shapes are conﬁrmed in
both ﬁeld and laboratory evidence (see Komar 1998). Thus, we establish with rigour
the existence of rotational nonlinear edge waves, unraveling the detail structure of the
wave pattern.

possible solutions of the equations (1)-(2) are (see Johnson 1997):

(i) the dynamic boundary condition P = P0 at the free surface, where P0 is the
constant atmospheric pressure, decouples the motion of the air from that of the water;
(ii) the kinematic boundary condition at the free surface expresses the fact that

the same particles always form the free water surface;

(iii) the kinematic boundary condition at the bottom, requiring the normal velocity

component at the bed to be zero so that it is impossible for water to penetrate.

The general description of the propagation of a water wave is encompassed by the
equations (1)-(2) and the three boundary conditions (i)-(iii), a distinctive feature being
that the free surface is not known and must be determined as part of the solution.

We adopt the Lagrangian point of view by following the evolution of individual

water particles. We suppose that the position of a particle at time t is given by

particular particle before the passage of the wave (in still water), despite the fact that
the wave is not developing from the still state - otherwise, the ﬂow would be irrotational
in view of Helmholtz’s theorem (see Johnson 1997) but its vorticity is nonzero (see the
last section). Let us explain the origin of (3). Gerstner (1809; see Constantin 2001)
gave the only known nontrivial explicit solution to the full water-wave equations,

represents waves of ﬁnite amplitude in water of inﬁnite depth. This suggests that
it might be possible to construct an edge wave using an approach similar to the
one for a Gerstner wave ﬁeld. While the theoretical correctness of this conclusion
was established by Yih (1966) and Mollo-Christensen (1982), the outcome in both
treatements was an implicit form the water’s free surface which makes the obtained
waveform graphically and computationally inaccessible. The closed form (3) provides
the full details of the edge wave motion without considerable labour.

Our aim is to prove that the motion (3) is dynamically possible and that we can
associate to it an expression for the hydrodynamical pressure P such that the governing
equations and boundary conditions are all satisﬁed. The resulting free surface of the
water will be the edge wave we are looking for.

in each such plane the particle motion is precisely that of a Gerstner wave ﬁeld (see

The Lagrangian form of the equation of continuity (that is, the volume-preserving
property of the ﬂow) is fulﬁlled since the value of the Jacobian of the map (3) is
independent of time. This, together with the previously proved fact that (3) deﬁnes at
any ﬁxed time a diﬀeomorphism, shows that the motion described by (3) is dynamically
possible. To complete the proof that (3) describes the water motion induced by a
gravity wave, we have to check Euler’s equation (2) and the boundary conditions
(i)-(iii) for a suitably deﬁned value of the hydrodynamical pressure.

3 Discussion

We have presented an exact edge wave solution to the full water-wave problem,
the graphical depiction of which is a fairly easy exercise. Let us now emphasize some
of its signiﬁcant properties. We present some simple observations which will provide
a comprehensive description of this nonlinear wave and the particle motion it induces
below the water surface.

The wavelength in the longshore direction λ = 2π/k is related to the wave fre-

quency ω by

while the wave period is

We easily infer that

gT 2
2π
so that the length of the edge wave is strongly dependent on its period and to a smaller
degree on the beach slope. The phase velocity U of the edge wave (4) is given by

a fact consistent with the observation that if the bottom is ﬂat (α = 0), then U = 0
and no edge wave exists. The dispersion relation (5) for edge waves is obtained (see
Johnson 1997) within the conﬁnes of the formal linear approximation to the governing
equations, but in our case the relation is derived rigorously as a byproduct of (3).

From (3) it is clear that any water particle describes circles as the edge wave passes
ek(b−c) of
- all these circles lie in planes parallel to the sloped bottom. The radius
the circle described counterclockwise by a particle is maximal for the particles at the
shoreline (that is, for b = b0, c = 0).

As pointed out in the previous section, the motion of the water body induced by
the passage of the edge wave (4) is rotational. The vorticity of the water ﬂow deﬁned
by (3) is

at a particle whose parameters are (a, b, c). Therefore the vorticity is in the opposite
sense to the revolution of the particles in their circular orbits, decreasing rapidly with
distance from the shoreline/bed. Observe that, despite the fact that the ﬂow (3) is
not two-dimensional, the vorticity of each individual water particle is conserved as the
particle moves about.

The run-up pattern is obtained by setting z = 0 in (4); this forces b = b0 so that

The cusp formation by some edge waves was clearly demonstrated in wave-tank ex-
periments and found by ﬁeld measurements on the ocean beach (see Komar 1998).

Another aspect of interest is the amplitude of the edge wave. To determine the

elevation with respect to the reference plane

we compute the distance of a point (x, y, z) lying on the free surface (4) to this plane,

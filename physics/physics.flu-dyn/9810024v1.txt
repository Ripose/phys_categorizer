Abstract

The classical Helmholtz problem is applied for modelling the axisymmetric in-
viscid cusp-ended separated ﬂow around a sphere. Two coordinate systems are
employed: polar for initial calculations and parabolic the latter being more suit-
able for investigation of inﬁnitely long stagnation zones. Scaled coordinates are
introduced and diﬀerence schemes for the free-stream equation and the Bernoulli
integral are devised. The separation point is not initially prescribed and is deﬁned
iteratively. A separated ﬂow with vanishing drag coeﬃcient is obtained.

1. Introduction

In an attempt to explain the existence of a sizable drag force upon a submerged
body even for vanishing viscosity, Helmholtz [10] introduced the notion of discontinuous
ideal ﬂow consisting of a potential and stagnant parts; these matching at an unknown
stream surface. The idea of discontinuous ideal ﬂow was successfully applied by Kirchhoﬀ
[11] for bodies with sharp edges and later developed by Levi-Civita [12], Villat [20],
Brodetsky [4], etc. for bodies with curved proﬁle when additional condition for smooth
separation (Brillouin-Villat condition) is to be satisﬁed. All these solutions are planar
and based on the hodograph method. Unfortunately this powerful tool is not capable
for ideal ﬂows characterized by axial symmetry. Therefore the eﬀorts in solving of such
kind ﬂows is mainly conﬁned to the numerical approach. Hitherto there are known several
approximate methods for study of axisymmetric ideal ﬂows. The most important methods
appear to be: the integral one used at ﬁrst by Treﬀtz [19] and later extended by Struck
[16]; the relaxation one applied by Southwell&Vaisey [15] and developed by Brennen [3]
(for detailed reference see [21, 9]). Similarly to the plane ﬂows in the case of curve bodies a
smooth separation condition or any else semi-empirical assumptions are suggested in order
to yield satisfactory forecast concerning the velocity and pressure distribution, detachment
point and drag coeﬃcient [1, 2, 13]. Particularly Southwell&Vaisey by working in the
physical plane obtained only cusp-ended cavity behind a sphere. We also calculated such
kind stagnation zone behind a sphere [17] by means of ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme at that

1

without pre-conditioning the separation point. Now we aim at utilizing the improved
diﬀerence scheme, which was developed and applied for the planar inviscid ﬂow around
circular cylinder [18] for investigation of a separated axisymmetric ﬂow around a sphere.
Following our approach we use two diﬀerent coordinate systems: a polar spherical
coordinate system for initial calculations and a parabolic coordinate system the latter
being topologically more suited for solving the free-stream equation outside inﬁnitely-
long stagnation zones. We switch from polar coordinates to parabolic ones after the
stagnation zone has fairly well developed and has become long enough.

2. Posing the Problem

Consider the steady inviscid ﬂow past a circle – an arbitrary meridian cross section of
a sphere. The direction of the ﬂow coincides with the line θ = 0, π of the polar coordinates
and the leading stagnation point of the ﬂow is situated in the point θ = π. The axially
symmetry enables to study the ﬂow in the meridian halfplane only.

Dimensionless variables are introduced as follows

(2.1)

where L is the characteristic length of the body (2a for a sphere of radius a), U∞ – velocity
of the undisturbed ﬂow; pc – the pressure inside the stagnation zone; p∞ – the pressure
at inﬁnity, r - the polar radius, σ, τ -the parabolic coordinates, κ - the cavitation number,
which for ﬂows with stagnation zones is equal to zero. Without fear of confusion the
primes will be omitted henceforth.

2.1. Coordinate Systems

On the combined surface “body+stagnation zone” hold two conditions. The ﬁrst

condition secures that the said boundary is a streamline (say of number “zero”)

ψ(R(θ), θ) = 0, θ

where R(θ), S(τ ) are the shape functions of the total boundary in spherical or parabolic
coordinates, respectively. As usually we use the notation Γ1 for the portion of boundary
representing the rigid body (the sphere) and Γ2 – for the free streamline (Fig.1).

On Γ2 the shape function R(θ) is unknown and it is to be implicitly identiﬁed from
Bernoulli integral with the pressure equal to a constant (say, pc) which is the second

following equations for shape functions R(θ) or S(τ ):

then in terms of the new coordinates (η, ξ), the governing equation (2.2) takes the form

Thus eqs.(2.8), (2.9), (2.10), (2.6) deﬁne a well posed boundary value problem provided
that functions R(θ) and S(τ ) are known. On the other hand in the portion Γ2 of the
boundary (where these functions are unknown) they can be evaluated from the Bernoulli

Apparently the presence of a stagnation zone breaks the symmetry of the integral
for the normal stresses and hence D’Alembert paradox is not hold. If denote by n the

then the force acting upon the body is given by

4. Diﬀerence Scheme and Algorithm

4.1. Splitting scheme for the free-stream equation

Let us denote the spacings of the mesh by hi+1 ≡

The computational domain being inﬁnite is reduced to ﬁnite one after appropriately choos-
ing the “actual inﬁnities”. In order to take into consideration the topological and dynamic
features of the ﬂow we employ non-uniform mesh, which was presented in detail at [18].
ηi , i = 1, . . . , M and
ξj , j = 1, . . . , N. We solve the boundary value problem iteratively using
gj+1 ≡
the method of splitting of operator. Upon introducing ﬁctitious time we render the
equation to parabolic type and then employ the so-called scheme of stabilising correction
[22]. On the ﬁrst half-time step we have the following diﬀerential equations (∆t is the
time increment)

respective boundary conditions [7]. Here

(3.3)

(4.1)

(4.2)

are the usual diﬀerence operators based on three-point patterns with second order of
approximation.

Thus the b.v.p. for the stream function is reduced to consequative systems with sparse

(three-diagonal) matrices, which are solved iteratively [7].

Since the condition for numerical stability of the elimination is not satisﬁed for all
points of domain here a “non-monotonous progonka” (see [14, 5]) is employed like at [18].

4.2. Diﬀerence Approximation for the Free Boundary

Following [18] in the present work we use the dynamic condition (2.5) in spherical
coordinates only, so that we present here just the relevant scheme in spherical coordinates.
The equations (2.11) can be resolved for the derivative R′(θ) when the following conditions
are satisﬁed:

4.3. The general Consequence of the Algorithm

Each global iteration contains two stages. On the ﬁrst stage, the diﬀerence problem
for free-stream equation is solved iteratively either in polar spherical or in parabolic
coordinates (depending on the development of the stagnation zone).

The second stage of a global iteration consists in solving the diﬀerence problem for

the free surface in polar spherical coordinates.

Through the indetermination at the axis of symmetry we use the diﬀerence scheme
(4.4a) only during the ﬁrst several iterations (in polar spherical coordinates). The cal-
culation of the shape of the far weak (in parabolic coordinates) we carry out using the
scheme (4.4b). The latter appears to be more convenient and eﬃcient because the loss
of accuracy and ’numerical’ instability in vicinity of the axis of cusp are avoided. The
criterion for convergence of the global iterations is deﬁned by the convergence of the shape
function, namely

5. Results and Discussion

The numerical correctness of scheme (4.1), (4.2) is veriﬁed through usual experiments
including a doubling the mesh knots and varying the ’actual inﬁnity’ We used diﬀer-
ent meshes with sizes M x N : 41x68, 81x136, 101x202, etc. Respectively, the actual
inﬁnity η∞ assumed in the numerical experiments the values 10, 20. The dependence
of the numerical solution on the time increment ∆t is also investigated and it is shown
that the scheme of fractional steps for the stream function has a full approximation [22].
Comparing the diﬀerent ﬁnite-diﬀerence realizations of the solution we choice the follow-
ing ’optimal’ values of the governing parameters: step of the ﬁctitious time ∆t = 0.5,
relaxation ω = 0.01 and ’actual’ inﬁnity η∞ = 10.

In Fig.2-a are presented the obtained shapes of the stagnation zone behind the sphere

136 and 101

Evidently the agreement among the calculated shapes of the free boundary near the
body corresponding to these three meshes is very well. The logarithmic scale is used in
Fig.2-b in order to expand the diﬀerences between the diﬀerent solutions making them
visible in the graph. As clearly it is shown the curves are indistinguishable till distance
150 calibers and the relative error is less than 1%. The relative error between the meshes
202 at distances more than 150 calibers does not exceed 4%. At the
81
same time the relative error between the mesh 41
68 and the else two ones increases and
reaches 7-8% at distance 200 calibers. Obviously that mesh is not enough ﬁne and appears
to be coarse for calculating the shape function at large distances behind the sphere. The
obtained results warrant conclusion that the scheme is fully eﬀective in solving the free
boundary till 200 calibers. The very good comparison supports the claim that indeed a
solution to the Helmholtz problem has been found numerically by means of the developed
in the present work diﬀerence scheme. The calculated here dimensionless pressure q is

shown in Fig.3. The agreement among the obtained pressure curves corresponding to
diﬀerent mesh resolutions is excellent. In the stagnation zone the pressure is in order of
10−4 in accordance with the assumption that the unknown boundary is deﬁned by the
condition q = 0. The amplitude of the minimum of q is smaller than 1.25 the latter
being the value for ideal ﬂow without separation. This means that the stagnation zone
inﬂuences the ﬂow upstream. The calculated magnitude of the separation angle (measured
68 and 69.7◦
with respect the rear end of the sphere) varies between 69.42◦ for mesh 41
202. It is interesting to note that the calculated here drag coeﬃcient Cx
for mesh 101
×
10−2 obtained for the diﬀerent resolutions,
has a magnitude between .5848
i.e., we conclude that in order of approximation of the scheme Cx = 0. Then similarly to
the separated ﬂow around circular cylinder we can name the obtained separation angle
’critical’ (see [18, 9]). Hence in the case of axisymmetric ﬂow around sphere there also
exists a inviscid separated ﬂow for which the D’Alembert paradox holds. Trough the
disscused features of the obtained Helmholtz ﬂow we can assume it is an axisymmetric
analogue of the Chaplygin-Kolscher ﬂow around circular cylinder.

6. Concluding Remarks

The separated inviscid ﬂow behind a sphere is treated as a ﬂow with free surface
– the boundary of the stagnation zone (Helmholtz problem). Scaled coordinates are
employed rendering the computational domain into a region with ﬁxed boundaries and
transforming the Bernoulli integral into an explicit equation for the shape function. A new
free-stream function is introduced and thus the numerical instability near the symmetry
axis is avoided. Diﬀerence scheme using coordinate splitting is devised. Exhaustive set of
numerical experiments is run and the optimal values of scheme parameters are deﬁned.
Results are veriﬁed on grids with diﬀerent resolutions. The obtained here shape of the
stagnation zone is of inﬁnitely long cusp and respective separated ﬂow has vanishing drag
coeﬃcient. The detachment point is not prescribed in advance and it is deﬁned iteratively
satisfying the mere Bernoulli integral there.

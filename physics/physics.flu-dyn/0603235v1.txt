Experimental Study of Parametric Autoresonance in Faraday Waves

The excitation of large amplitude nonlinear waves is achieved via parametric autoresonance of
Faraday waves. We experimentally demonstrate that phase locking to low amplitude driving can
generate persistent high-amplitude growth of nonlinear waves in a dissipative system. The experi-
ments presented are in excellent agreement with theory.

Introduction. When a nonlinear oscillator is resonantly
driven by small amplitude periodic forcing, the amplitude
growth is arrested, even at zero dissipation, when nonlin-
earity comes into play. This is because a frequency mis-
match develops between the (constant) driving frequency
and the (amplitude dependent) oscillator frequency [1].
Persistent amplitude growth can be achieved, by autores-
onance, when the system nonlinearly locks to an exter-
nally varied (“chirped”) driving frequency to retain res-
onant conditions. The precise form of the chirp is unim-
portant once its sign is correct, and the chirp rate is
below a critical value. First predicted for harmonic forc-
ing, autoresonance has found many applications [2]. The
technique was extended to weakly dissipative oscillators
[3] and to nonlinear waves and vortices in non-dissipative
systems [4]. The theory of parametric autoresonance
(PAR) was recently developed, ﬁrst for nonlinear oscilla-
tors [5] and later [6] for nonlinear Faraday waves: stand-
ing gravity waves on a free surface of a ﬂuid which are
excited parametrically by vertical vibrations. This the-
ory [6] predicts that a downward chirp of the vibration
frequency should cause persistent wave growth, which is
only expected to terminate at large amplitudes, when an
underlying constant frequency system (CFS), introduced
below, ceases to exhibit a non-trivial stable ﬁxed point.

Here we report the ﬁrst experimental veriﬁcation of
PAR excitation of a nonlinear wave. Using Faraday
waves we demonstrate that autoresonance is not hindered
by moderate dissipation, and the results compare well
with an extended version of the theory [6]. We show that
the predicted (negative) frequency chirp indeed drives
persistent wave growth, via the PAR mechanism, to am-
plitudes that surpass the theory’s region of validity.

Theory. The theory of PAR excitation of nonlinear
Faraday waves [6] is based on an amplitude expansion
that extends earlier constant-frequency treatments [7, 8]
to the chirped frequency case. Here we summarize the
main predictions of Ref. [6] and extend the model by (i)
introducing a more general form of driving acceleration,
and (ii) taking a more complete account of dissipation.

Throughout this Letter we consider a rectangular ﬂuid
cell of length l, width w and depth h in the x, y, and z
direction, respectively. To avoid three-wave interactions
[9] we assume that the surface tension corrections are

t

small [10]. Furthermore, we assume a deep water limit
h > l and a suﬃciently small w so that the ﬂuid motion
is two-dimensional, depending on x, z and t. The vertical
displacement of the vibrating cell is ζ(t) = ζ0(t) cos Φ(t),
0 ω(t′) dt′ is the driving phase, while the
where Φ(t) =
driving frequency ω(t) and amplitude ζ0(t) vary slowly on
R
the time scale of ω−1. In the weakly nonlinear regime,
the (time-dependent) scaled acceleration of the cell is
ε(t) = ω2(t)ζ0(t)/g
1, where g is the gravity ac-
celeration. As a result, the wave steepness parameter
1, where k = π/l is the wave number of the
kηmax ≪
fundamental mode, and η is the wave amplitude. As the
nonlinear frequency shift of standing gravity waves, in the
deep-water limit, is negative [7], the PAR driving must
use a negative frequency chirp: dω/dt < 0. The ampli-
tude dynamics of the fundamental mode are governed, at
leading nonlinear order, by the equation [6]:

Ω are the linear wave fre-

quency and eﬀective linear damping rate, respectively
(see Ref.
[12] for a review of diﬀerent contributions to
γ). Higher order modes are enslaved to η1 and can be
calculated once η1 is found. For concreteness, we as-
sume a linear chirp: ω(t) = ω0
µ t, where µ > 0 is
constant, and ω0 = 2Ω is the resonant value of the driv-
ing frequency. We also assume ε(t) = ε0(1 + β t), where
ε0 > 0 and β > 0 are constant [11]. Now we make an
ansatz η1(t) = A(t) cos [Ωt + ϕ(t)], where A and ϕ are the
slowly varying amplitude and phase, and use the averag-
ing method [1]. Rescaling time τ = (ε0Ωt)/4, amplitude

large amplitudes, when higher-order corrections to Eqs.

Alternatively, we can start from a very small initial
amplitude B0 far from resonance and pass through the
resonance. In the linear locking stage, we can drop the

Computer-triggered visualization of the wave proﬁle
was performed by uniform illumination of the ﬂuid-air
interface from behind. The interface’s high curvature,
due to its wetting of the side walls, refracted light away
from a CCD camera mounted on the opposite side of the
cell. This resulted in a sharp dark edge depicting the in-
terface, see Fig. 1. A reference mark on the cell enabled
measurement of its instantaneous vertical position. Edge
detection produced a vector of the interface’s location

scaled amplitude of the fundamental, kA, measures the
steepness of the wave proﬁle. To enable direct compari-
son to theory, we needed to isolate the fundamental of the
interface waveform. To this end, we measured the diﬀer-
ence in wave elevation between two points, chosen to be
symmetrical about the center of the cell on the x-axis.
This eliminates, by symmetry, all of the even harmonics
of the interface elevation. Although the third harmonic
is not ﬁltered out, the resulting systematic error of A is
only about 1% at kA = 0.2, and does not exceed 6% for
kA = 0.6. We could therefore ignore the third harmonic
while comparing our measurements with the theory in
the weakly nonlinear regime. The statistical error in kA,

ever, no phase locking occurs. Here φ diverges rapidly
away from the steady-state curves, and subsequently kA
rapidly decays to zero.

The wave damping rate γ can be extracted from mea-
surements of ac, since Γ = 1 at the instability onset.
With γ in hand, we can directly compare our measure-
ments to theoretical predictions with no other free pa-
rameters. The measured phase diﬀerence for δ = 0 agrees
within 5% with the predicted value. The slow increase in
φ with δ in Fig. 2(c) is due to higher order nonlinearities.
Our ﬁrst series of measurements used a linear chirp,
δ = µt/ω0, starting from a steady state wave with a small
but ﬁnite amplitude, at ω = ω0 and a = a0 > ah. Impor-
tantly, our choice of the system parameters precluded the
excitation of other linear modes during a negative chirp.
As shown in Fig. 2(a), ah(δ) is almost linear with δ for
0
δ < 0.12. To maximize the frequency range of the
excitation, we ramped a linearly in time, a(δ) = a0 + αδ,
to make a nearly parallel (α = 0.609 g) to ah(δ).

for the same ramp and initial conditions [14]. For small
values of µ, phase-locking occurs where, as a function of
δ, both kA and φ quickly converge to the values that they

(3).

As the theoretical curves were obtained with no free
parameters, the agreement between experiment and the-
ory is striking. Although the transients are slightly more
long-lived in the theory, identical convergence/divergence
of both the phase and amplitude of the waves to/from
their steady-state values is observed for all of the values
of µ used.

An important prediction of the theory is that above
an a0-dependent critical chirp rate, µcr, phase-locking is
not possible. For relatively small values of a0, there is
good quantitative agreement between the measured and
predicted values of µcr, see Fig. 3(e). Furthermore, µcr
still exists for larger accelerations. Even though µcr in-
creases with a0, as predicted, the predicted and observed
values of µcr systematically diverge with increasing a0.
This divergence is not surprising, as for a0 > 0.07 g the
phase-locking occurs for kA > 0.4, where we would ex-
pect the weakly nonlinear theory to become inaccurate.
These results imply that PAR for µ < µcr persists far
beyond the region of validity of the weakly nonlinear ap-
proximation. Note that transient stages of φ in Fig. 3
trace an envelope, corresponding to the universal trajec-
tory (a saddle point) obtained at µ = µcr [6].

Our second series of measurements involve “passing
through” the resonance at ω0 before any waves are ini-
tially excited. We begin from a ﬂat state at a negative
detuning δinit < 0 (i.e. ω > ω0), with ac(δ = 0) < a <
ac(δinit). We then apply a linear chirp δ = µt/ω0 while
keeping a ﬁxed throughout the experiment. As δ is in-
creased, we pass through a region of δ where a > ac(δ).
The dynamics of passing through resonance are demon-
strated in Fig. 4, where experimental measurements of
kA as function of δ are shown for several chirp rates.
As in Fig. 3, the distinction between phase locking at
low values of µ and phase unlocked states at high values
of µ is clear. A closer look at Fig. 4(a), however, re-
veals that the precise value of µcr is undetermined. Two
diﬀerent runs with the identical chirp rate of µ = 0.27
sec−2 have qualitatively diﬀerent behavior: one decays,
while the other phase locks into PAR. The diﬀerence in
these two runs stems from the dependence of µcr on the
wave’s initial amplitude A0. As the waves evolve from
noise, we do not have experimental control over A0. In
Fig. 4(b) we present ﬁts of the initial stages of both of
the µ = 0.27 sec−2 trajectories shown in Fig. 4(a) to Eq.
(4), where the sole ﬁtting parameter is the value of A0.

termine the wave’s long-time dynamics. Similarly, we

In summary, one can control nonlinear Faraday waves
by employing PAR. The PAR technique remains opera-
tional for moderate dissipation and well beyond the weak
nonlinearity. It would be interesting to extend it to multi-
mode regimes and to other examples of nonlinear waves.

Abstract

The Jacobs-Rebbi equation arises in many contexts where vortical
motion in two-dimensional ideal media is investigated. Alternatively,
it can be derived in the Abelian Higgs ﬁeld theory. It is considered
non-integrable and numerical solutions have been found, consisting of
localised, robust vortices. We show in this work that the equation is
integrable and provide the Lax pair. The exact solution is obtained
in terms of Riemann theta functions.

1 Introduction

Studying the interaction energy of vortices of the Ginsburg-Landau model of
superconductivity, Jacobs and Rebbi [1] have derived a nonlinear equation
from which the scalar function (order parameter) can be calculated. The
derivation is based on the similarity of this model with the Abelian Higgs
theory [2], [3], [4]. In a special case, corresponding to a particular choice of
parameters, the nonlinear equation takes a simple form, a nonlinear elliptic
diﬀerential equation in two spatial dimensions. The same problem is treated
by Dunne [5] in a general context of gauge theories with Maxwell and/or
Chern-Simons terms in the Lagrangean density. The same Abelian Higgs ﬁeld

theory is discussed and the special case mentioned above is identiﬁed as the
minimum of the action functional (saturation of the Bogomolnyi inequality),
realized by ﬁelds obeying a simpler set of equations. This special case is
called self-duality, with reference to the equality of the diﬀerential two-form
(the curvature of the ﬁbre bundle) with its Hodge dual in the geometrical
setting of the ﬁeld-theoretical content.

In ﬂuids and plasmas coherent motion and in particular vortices are ubiq-
uituous [6]. They can appear even in turbulent states. In two-dimensions,
apart from the dynamical equations derived from the conservation laws an
alternative model has been proposed, consisting of the motion of discrete,
point-like vortices in plane interacting via a potential [7]. It has been shown
that this model can be mapped onto a ﬁeld-theoretical model whose struc-
ture is very similar with the non-Abelian gauge-Higgs ﬁeld theory [8]. The
self-dual state of this ﬁeld at stationarity is precisely the asymptotic state
of the ideal ﬂuid, which eﬀectively provides an analytic derivation of the
sinh-Poisson equation describing the ﬂuid streamfunction. For the station-
ary states attained at very large time by the ideal ion instability in plasma
(described by Hasegawa-Mima), the model of discrete vortices interacting in
plane introduces a short-range potential (then a massive photon of the gauge
ﬁeld in the ﬁeld theoretical model).

There are two diﬀerences between the ﬁeld theoretical models developed
starting from the plasma problems and the model from which Jacobs-Rebbi
equation is derived. First, the absolute value of the scalar Higgs ﬁeld is
constant at large distances (on a circle of very large radius); this means
that the vorticity should be constant at large distance, in the plasma case.
Second, the model must be Abelian, which is less than we would need for
treating the case of the Euler ﬂuid (the sinh-Poisson equation). However,
there are physical situations where the boundary conditions for the vorticity
are compatible with the formulation of the Jacobs-Rebbi model. And, it
is known that Abelian models can provide description of plasma problems
(guiding centre particles, for example) leading to the Liouville equation. The
eﬀect of these diﬀerences still needs to be investigated, but in any case, the
exact determination of the solution can only be a useful instrument.

It is usual to consider that the Jacobs-Rebbi equation cannot be solved

analytically and in consequence numerical solutions have been provided.

We show in this paper that the Jacobs-Rebbi equation is exactly inte-
grable. We consider the integrability on periodic domains and provide the
Lax pair. We follow the standard algebraic-geometric method of integration
and generate explicit solutions in terms of Riemann theta functions.

2 Derivation of the Jacobs-Rebbi equation

2.1 Derivation in the context of Ginsburg-Landau the-

ory

The Ginsburg-Landau theory is the framework in which the Jacobs-Rebbi
equation has been derived, since the original aim was the investigation of
the energy of interaction between two vortices in superconducting Helium.
The interest for vortical structures of Ginsburg-Landau comes also from the
observation that the theory of a gauge ﬁeld coupled to a scalar ﬁeld (Abelian
Higgs ﬁeld) can in some cases exhibit also coherent vortical structures. We
include in this Section the derivation according by Jacobs and Rebbi [1]. In
ﬂuid physics other approaches can be developed to arrive at similar forms of
the equation.

3 General procedure for obtaining solutions

of the Jacobs-Rebbi equation

The procedure is similar to those developed for the sine-Gordon equation [9]
and for sinh-Poisson equation [10]. Just as in the general case of nonlinear
diﬀerential equations which are exctly integrable by the algebraic-geometric
procedure, we start from a conﬁguration which is speciﬁed initially. By con-
trast with other equations (for example KdV, etc) where the variables are
space and time and the unknown function is given at t = 0, here the coor-
dinates are both spatial. Then the conditions to be speciﬁed are boundary
conditions, for example taken on the lines x = 0 and y = 0.

Consider that a certain ﬂow conﬁguration is speciﬁed (for example from
experimental measurements) and the boundary conditions are speciﬁed in
the form of two functions

u0x (y) and u0y (x)

∈

∈

[0, L] and y

for x
[0, L]. We assume that L is much smaller than
the radius of the circle on which the asymptotic value of the vorticity is
given. The “initial” values of the unknown function is introduced in the
Lax operator eigenvalue problem. Solving this problem we identify a set
of eigenvalues (the Lax operator spectrum, see [11]) and the corresponding

6

eigenfunctions with periodicity properties (Bloch functions). It is a general
situation that in the spectrum there is a subset of eigenvalues for which the
two eigenfunctions are identical. These eigenvalues are called non-degenerate
and the subset is called main spectrum.

Using the main spectrum one can construct the hyperelliptic Riemann
surface associated with the Wronskian of the eigenfunctions. For a two by two
Lax operator, (i.e. hyperelliptic Riemann surface) the monodromy problem
is simple.

One has to deﬁne on this surface the dual homological sets: cycles and

diﬀerential one-forms. Then the period matrices can be calculated.

Using the inverse of the A-period matrix one can generate the variables

(the phases) appearing in the arguments of the Riemann theta function.

Finally, one can calculate the solution at any point (x, y) and can repre-

sent it graphically on a space domain.

3.1 The spectral problem for the Jacobi-Rebbi equa-

tion on periodic domain

for the sine-Gordon equation [9], we obtain the following Lax equations. The

a function of only the eigenvalue p, allows us to discuss the problem of the
existence of two independent solutions to the systems of equations. There
will be independent solutions everywhere on the complex p plane except at
the points where the Wronskian vanishes. The set of points on the complex p
plane where the Wronskian vanishes (and there is only one solution) is called
main spectrum of the scattering problem.

We will write the squared Wronskian (i.e. C) as a polynomial of the
variable p thus formally introducing the points of the main spectrum, pi, i =

Eq.(16) shows that if we have the main spectrum and if we could calculate

3.3 Checking the formulas as solutions

As Ting, Chen, Lee [10] have shown for the case of the sinh-Poisson equation,
it may be useful to try to ﬁnd out if the formulas determined above, Eqs.(20)
and (21) may already be taken as solution, for a set of γk which is not yet
determined. The procedure consists of replacing the expression (16) in the
initial equation, perform the derivatives of the functions γk (x, y) appearing
in this expression and taking into account the equations of motion, Eqs.(20)
and (21).

The following change of variables makes the calculation easier

and (21) (or, equivalently, Eqs.(22) and (23) ) the two expressions (25) and
(26) are identical. This means that the initial nonlinear equation is veriﬁed
if u (x, y) is given by the expression (16). The veriﬁcation can be done by
summing the residuues in a formal expression deﬁned by integration in the
complex plane of a function having an adequate singularity structure. We

3.4 Solving the equations for the auxiliary spectrum

To solve the diﬀerential equations for γk (x, y; p) , k = 1, ..., N starting from a
set of initial conditions is a diﬃcult task as is apparent from the form of the
Eqs.(20) and (21). However there is a standard procedure that provides the
analytic solution of these equations. It is based on the fundamental property
of γk (x, y; p) of being deﬁned when p maps the complex plane (of the spectral
variable of the Lax operator) to the complex function given by the square
root of the Wronskian. Since the later is a polynomial in p, the square root
deﬁnes a hyperelliptic Riemann surface, i.e. a compactiﬁed double covering
of the complex plane with cuts connecting pairs of zeros of the Wronskian.
These are the points
of the main spectrum, plus the point
}
zero and the point at inﬁnity. The point zero appears since in formulas (20)
and (21) a factor of √γk can be adjoined to the product of the l = 1, ..., 2N
pl), simply by taking formally p0 = 0. Then the object
diﬀerences (γk −
which can be deﬁned on the basis of the square root of the Wronskian but
reﬂecting the need for the particular form in the equations of γk ’s is

pk, k = 1, ..., 2N
{

R (p) =

2N

v

with p0 = 0. The geometry of this hyperelliptic surface is important in
ﬁnding the solution.

Pairs of zeros pk are joined by cuts and in addition the origin is connected
to inﬁnity. This gives a number of N + 1 cuts and generates a compact
Riemann surface of genus g = N.

On this surface there are deﬁned two objects characterising the diﬀerential

geometry of the curve:

•

a basis of the one dimensional cohomology group of the surface; this
means two sets each of N closed paths on the curve (cycles), having

17

particular intersection properties. The two sets are noted aj, and re-
spectively bj, j = 1, ..., N. The intersections are

ak = 0
bk = δjk
bk = 0

aj ◦
aj ◦
bj ◦

A typical example, for an elliptic curve g = 1 with the topology of the
torus, consists of the two possible closed turns around the torus, the
short way (a) and the long way (b).

a basis in the ring of the one-dimensional diﬀerential forms

•

dµk =

R (p)

With these two sets one calculate several quantities which are invariants
of the Riemann surface. Essentially there are calculated integrals of the
elements of the basis of diﬀerential forms along the cycles aj and bj. These
are called periods and are organised in two matrices

Aij =

dµi =

The equations can be trivially integrated and we obtain the (x, y) depen-

(31)

where φk0 are constants of integration, initial phases.

We note from Eq.(31) that the motion on the Jacobi torus is entirely
determined by the main spectrum through the topological properties of the
hyeprelliptic Riemann surface (canonical cycles, diﬀerential forms, period
matrices).

3.5 The Jacobi inversion

After the determination of the phases φk, which are points on the Jacobi
torus, we want to be able to retrive the functions γk (x, y) of the auxiliary
spectrum, since they are necessary for the explicit determination of the solu-
tion u (x, y), via Eq.(16). This constitutes the Jacobi inversion problem and
has been solved in connection with elliptic functions. The main instrument
is the Riemann theta function.

The deﬁnition of the Riemann theta function involves a vector of dimen-
N matrix τ whose elements have the

sion N (we denote it by φ) and a N
imaginary part positive.

In general the Θ function is associated to a hyperelliptic Riemann surface of
genus N generated for example from a two sheeted covering of the complex
plane with 2N + 1 or 2N + 2 branch points, between which N + 1 cuts ahve
been done. The matrix τ corresponds to the matrix determined from the
periods of the canonical diﬀerential one-forms on the canonical cycles, see
Eq.(27). The argument of the Θ function is the vector φ . The following
periodicity properties of the Θ functions are useful in the inversion problem:

1. The translation with unity of only one component of the vector φ leaves
Θ invariant. This is actually related with the fact that the components
of the arguments φk are coordinates along the cycles of the g-torus, and
so they are periodical. Using the symbol ek for a column vector of N
components having only one 1 in position k and 0 in rest, we have

Θ (φ + ek, τ ) = Θ (φ, τ )

2. Adding to the argument φ a vector consisting of one of the columns

3.6 Solution of the Jacobs-Rebbi equation in terms of

Riemann θ-functions

Any initial condition for the nonlinear Jacobs-Rebbi equation leads to a main
spectrum, i.e. a set of complex numbers
. From these we
}
construct the hyperelliptic Riemann surface of genus N and calculate the
period matrices and the phases of the linear motion along the canonical
aj cycles on the surface. This is purely topological and geometrical data,
generated from the main spectrum or, equivalently, by the initial condition
for the unknown solution u.

pk, k = 1, 2N

On the other hand, solving the Jacobi inversion problem provides us with
where γk are functions of the phases,

γk, k = 1, N
the auxiliary spectrum
and, as such, of the variables (x, y).

{

}

The eigenvalues of the main spectrum and the functions γk (x, y) of the
auxiliary spectrum give the explicit form of the solution u (x, y) via the con-
version formula

Returning to the result of the Jacobi inversion procedure, we will try to
express the ﬁrst sum in terms of the Θ function’s zero’s, i.e. in terms of the
zero’s of the function ζ (q).

In Ting, Chen and Lee [10] it is adopted the method consisting of gen-
erating directly the sum of the logarithms from an integral of a complex
function.

We have to remind that the hyperelliptic Riemann surface is a mapping
from the complex plane of the spectral parameter p via the square root of the
polynomial expression generated by the Wronskian. The variable q appearing
as the upper limit of integration in Eq.(32) is a point on the hyperelliptic
Riemann surface and is the image of a point in the complex p-plane; the

23

path of integration in Eq.(32) is the image of a path on the same p-plane.
We can try to introduce an intermediate object, a complex function whose
singularities will lead us, after integration, to the sum of logarithms. This is

w =

1
2πi

f (q)

dζ (q)
ζ (q)

(36)

ZΓ
with the contour of integration Γ being a path on the Riemann surface. This
path must be chosen such that it circles all the zero’s of ζ (q), and then the
value of the integral will be

where q0j, j = 1, N are

w =

f (q0j)

N

j=1
X

ζ (q0j) = 0

The contour Γ is speciﬁed after the Riemann surface is mapped back onto
the p-plane as the normal polygon obtained from cutting along the canonical
aj and bj cycles. Since the genus of the Riemann surface is N, the number of
cycles is 2N and each cycle generates two edges of the polygon, with opposite
senses. The polygon has 4N edges and it is chosen as the contour Γ. All the
points q0j are somewhere inside the polygon, so what we need is a choice for
the function f (q). It is natural to take

f (q)

ln q

≡
since we want the sum of the logarithms, but this induces an additional
singularity at q = 0 and a cut connecting q = 0 to
on the p-plane. This
cut on the p-plane is translated into two paths on the hyperelliptic Riemann
surface and since the variable of integration on the path is ζ we have to
connect the two points into which p = 0 is mapped with the single point on
the surface that corresponds to p =
. This actually separates the polygon
∞
Γ into two closed parts. The integration in Eq.(36) must be done separately
on the two contours. A part of the integration will be done along the cut and
in one integration the path correspond to one determination of the logarithm
(one branch) while in the other integration the path is on the next branch of
the logarithm.

These are two images of the compactiﬁed two sheeted covering of the
complex plane in two Riemann hyperelliptic curves with genus 2 and respec-
tively genus 3. They correspond with the case where the number of branch
points in the main spectrum pk is 2g + 2 = 6 and respectively 8 , i.e. if the
eigenvalues comes in three or four pairs.

An alternative calculation of the same integral Eq.(36) is done following
directly the path along the canonical cycles a and b. In this evaluation the
periodicity properties of the Θ function are essential. When the point of
integration q is on a bk cycle, the point that corresponds to it but attached
to the opposite side of the cut along the cycle can be reached by a complete
turn along the nearest a cycle. But such a change does not introduce any
modiﬁcation in the integrand, since it is exactly the operation involved in the
ﬁrst periodicity property of Θ. This means that the integration along the

edge of Γ coming from a cycle bk can be paired with the integration along
the edge coming from the opposite side of the cut along bk, without any
change in the integrand. Since these two integrals are equal but of opposite
sign we conclude that the edges originated from b-cycles do not contribute to
the integral. Analoguous consideration for the ak-cycles involve the second
property of the Θ function. If q is on an edge representing one side of the cut
along the ak cycle, the point q on other side can be reached by a complete
turn along a b cycle. This introduces the change of the integrand

This integral is a constant since dνk is a diﬀerential one-form generated from a
linear combination of the canonical one-forms (depending only on the surface)
and the integration is performed over closed loops ak. It does not leave any
choice since it does not depend on any parameter.

We have completed the calculation of the integral (37) in the two ways:
one with the polygonal dissection of the Riemann surface plus the branch
cut (which gives the right hand side of (37) ) and one with the path on
the surface, using the reunion of canonical cycles, obtaining the constant of
Eq.(38). It only remains to make explicit the last term in Eq.(37) coming
from the branch cut integration.

4 Conclusion

In conclusion we have proved that the Jacobs-Rebbi equation is exactly inte-
grable and have provided the exact solution. We have followed the standard
approaches developed in detail for similar equations: sine-Gordon and sinh-
Poisson equations.

Knowledge of the exact solution will make more accessible the investiga-

tion of the physical applications of this equation.

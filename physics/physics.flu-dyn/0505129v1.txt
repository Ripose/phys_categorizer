Abstract

We explain a mechanism for branching of a planar negative front. Branching occurs as the

result of a balance between the destabilizing eﬀect of impact ionization and the stabilizing eﬀect

of electron diﬀusion on ionization fronts. The dispersion relation for transversal perturbation is

obtained analytically and reads: s =

One of the greatest unsolved problems in the physics of electric discharges is the clari-

ﬁcation of the mechanism of branching. When a strong electric ﬁeld is applied to a non-

conducting medium such as a gas, narrow channels of ionized matter called streamers may

be formed. The phenomena has been observed in a wide range of scales, from small-gap

discharges of few centimetres up to scales of kilometres such as in sprites discharges from a

thunder cloud. The pattern of this branching resembles the ones observed in the propaga-

tion of cracks, dendritic growth and viscous ﬁngering. Those phenomena are known to be

governed by deterministic equations rather than by stochastic events. In this paper, for the

ﬁrst time, it is derived a quantitative prediction of the branching characteristic length based

on a deterministic model. The results give an explicit dependence of branching with the

electric ﬁeld and the pressure of the gas as it has been observed qualitatively in experiments.

We use a ﬂuid approximation to describe electric breakdown in non-attaching gases such

as nitrogen. In these gases, there are indications showing that the most important source

of electrons and positive ions from neutral molecules is impact ionization [1]. This is the

only process that will be taken into account in this work. This leads to a minimal streamer

model from which the electron Ne and positive ion Np densities can be obtained. The

minimal model reads

In the minimal model, a spontaneous branching of negative streamers has been observed

numerically [3], as it occurs in experimental situations [4].

In order to understand this

branching, the dispersion relation for transversal Fourier-modes of planar negative shock

fronts (without diﬀusion) has been derived [5]. For perturbations of small wave number k,

the planar shock front becomes unstable with a linear growth rate proportional to k, but all

the modes with large enough wave number k seem to grow at the same rate.

In this paper, we address the problem of the selection of a particular wave number in the

perturbation of negative planar fronts. We will obtain a new dispersion relation depending

explicitly on the electric ﬁeld and the electronic diﬀusion coeﬃcient (which depends also

on the gas pressure). Our analysis will show that the electron density Ne may develop

steep fronts of thickness O(√De), satisfying an equation analogous to Fisher equation [6]. A

surprising fact established during the last 30 years is that the combination of sharp interfaces
with small diﬀusive eﬀects may result in asymptotic limits (for De ≪
of the interface is described by equations involving solely geometrical properties such as its

1) in which the motion

mean curvature [7]. These analysis concerned a model today known as Allen-Cahn equation.

Subsequent work [8] showed that the points of the interface separating two diﬀerent phases

move along the normal direction with a velocity proportional to its mean curvature. This

kind of dynamics is termed ”mean curvature ﬂow”. Many mathematicians have contributed

to provide a rigorous proof of the convergence of Allen-Cahn model to motion by mean

curvature [9, 10, 11]. Remarkably, some of these limiting models may be such that the

solutions develop branch-like patterns. In this work, we exploit some of these ideas to study

the motion of ionization fronts. We will show that a planar front separating a (partly)

ionized region from a region without charge is such that small geometrical perturbations

in the charge distribution lead to a motion of the front aﬀected by two opposed eﬀects:

electrostatic repulsion of electrons and electron diﬀusion. The ﬁrst eﬀect tends to destabilize

the front while the second acts eﬀectively as a mean curvature contribution to the velocity of

the front, thus stabilizing it. The net result is the appearance of ﬁngers with a characteristic

thickness determined by the balance of these two opposing actions.

In order to study the evolution and branching of ionization fronts, we consider the fol-

3

lowing experimental situation. The space between two large planar plates, situated at x = 0

and x = d respectively (x is the vertical axis and we suppose that d

1), is ﬁlled with

≫

a non-attaching gas like nitrogen. A stationary electric potential diﬀerence is applied to

these plates, so that an electric ﬁeld is produced in the gas. The initial electric ﬁeld is

directed from the anode to the cathode, along the negative x axis, and is uniform in the

space between the plates. To initiate the avalanche, an initial seed of ionization is set near

the cathode. We ﬁrst study the evolution of planar negative ionization fronts towards the

anode.

We will concentrate in the study of the dynamics under the eﬀect of strong external

electric ﬁelds. We denote the modulus of the dimensionless electric ﬁeld at large distance

E∞ and we will assume that

it is in this region where the mechanisms leading to branching take place.

In the evolution of the ionization wave along the x axis, the rescaled electric ﬁeld can

FIG. 1: A planar front is perturbed by a displacement of characteristic size δ. The boundary layer

It appears in the context of mathematical biology [14] and is known to have solutions subject

to our matching conditions. This means that we have a boundary layer of width √D at

have ne ≈

so that ∂np/∂x is O(1) at the boundary layer.

Now we make a perturbation in the transversal direction y. We introduce a new system of

and δ is a suﬃciently small parameter (see Fig. 1). By doing this, we follow a strategy

analogous to the one used in Rubinstein et al. [8] to deduce the asymptotic approximation

of Allen-Cahn equation by mean curvature ﬂow.

in such way

that Eqs. (10)–(12) represent correct series expansions. Speciﬁcally, the correction to the

travelling wave proﬁles for ne will be O(δ2).

We insert these expressions into Eqs. (4)–(6). Then we impose that O(δ0) terms and

O(δ1) terms vanish. The solution of the equations at order O(δ0) is the travelling wave
found previously, so that n(0)

At order O(δ1), after some manipulations, and taking into account that ∂/∂x = O(D−1/2)

p /∂x = O(1) at the boundary layer, and that D is a small parameter, the equation

p decouples from the equations for the perturbed electron

e and the perturbed electric ﬁeld (E(1)

Observe that the system (13)–(14) simpliﬁes if one assumes that ϕ is independent of x.

This is a valid assumption at least for a short period of time (the one in which stability is

analyzed) if one assumes ϕ independent of x at t = 0.

It is more convenient to formulate Eq. (14) in terms of the electric potential. We note

that the total electric ﬁeld has to be irrotational since the magnetic ﬁeld is negligible. So

we will assume that E =

V , where V is an electric potential that can be written as

V (x, y) = V (0)(x) + δ V (1)(x, y). At order O(δ0), Poisson’s equation implies that V (0)(x)

This is an equation in dimensionless units. If we introduce typical scales for nitrogen (see the

paragraph below Eq. (3)), then we can obtain the typical distance between two consecutive

branches in a negative streamer discharge. This distance will decrease when the gas pressure

or the initial electric ﬁeld in the gas increases.

which corresponds to the nontrivial zero of the function s(k),

Although the predictions are made for negative planar fronts, they agree with the observed

fact that, for positive discharges, the number of streamers increases with the electric ﬁeld

and the pressure. Those eﬀects are accounted by the expression (23).

We can now provide a qualitative mechanism of streamer branching. When the radius of

a streamer becomes larger than the critical length given by Eq. (25), the streamer becomes

unstable and branching develops. The electric ﬁeld which should be taken into Eq. (23) in

case of inhomogeneous electric discharges is the local ﬁeld at the front of the streamer. In

order to test the predictions, experimental evidence should be provided in the range where

the approximations of large electric ﬁelds and small diﬀusion coeﬃcient are valid.

To conclude, we have derived analytically the characteristic length of branching for planar

negative ionization fronts. At the same time, this prediction can be considered as a test for

the validity of the minimal deterministic model on which this calculation is based.

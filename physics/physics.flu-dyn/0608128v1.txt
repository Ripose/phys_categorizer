The partial oalesene of a droplet onto a planar liquid/liquid interfae is investigated theoreti-

ally by using a dimensional analysis. It mainly depends on the Bond number (gravity vs. surfae

tension), the Ohnesorge numbers (visosity in both (cid:29)uids in ontat vs. surfae tension) and the

density relative di(cid:27)erene. An experimental work on 2000 oalesene events is made in order to

study the impat of visosities and gravity on the oalesene proess. Global quantities suh as

the available surfae energy of the droplet has been measured during the oalesene. The surfae

energy is onverted into kineti energy at a onstant rate that is independent of the oalesene

outome. The ratio between the daughter droplet size and the mother droplet size is investigated

as a funtion of the dimensionless numbers. Theoretial models are proposed to (cid:28)t experimental

data. The asymmetrial behavior when liquids are inverted indiates that the visous dissipation is

di(cid:27)erent in both (cid:29)uids. In the surrounding (cid:29)uid, the apillary waves are damped during their travel

from the bottom to the top of the droplet. Inside the droplet, the apillary waves are mainly damped

during their reation at the bottom of the droplet. This unexplored damping mehanism is most

probably ahieved by the way of the vortex ring that is sometimes observed below the droplet during

oalesene. Finally, aording to the present theoretial models, preditions are made about the

main features of partial oalesene for many ouples of immisible (cid:29)uids. The maximum number

of steps in the asade has been found to be equal to 11. That ould be obtained for an interfae

between merury and a non-visous immisible liquid.

The simplest way to get experimental information about

This law is based on a balane between inertia and sur-

possible to rewrite this equation with the apillary time

when there is a tangential (cid:29)ow near a urved interfae

In this setion, the ratio between the daughter droplet

1. Asymptoti regime

Thanks to the dimensional analysis (see setion II), we

have shown that for negligible Bo, Oh1 and Oh2 (surfae
tension is the only dominant fore), Ψ depends only on

the density relative di(cid:27)erene.

As shown by Blanhette [7℄, apillary waves that travel

along the droplet are responsible for the pinh-o(cid:27) pro-

nal radius. Considering axisymmetri and irrotationnal

perturbations of an ideal inompressible droplet without

gravity, it is possible to (cid:28)nd the dispersion relationship

On Fig.8(a) and 8(b), the dependenes of Ψ on Ohne-

2 leads to a smooth dereasing of Ψ with Oh2 , start-

for partial oalesene Oh2c is about 0.4, whih is 10
times greater than Oh2w , the ritial Ohnesorge for wave

When visosities are similar, it is straight forward to show

that the energy dissipation rate is similar in both (cid:29)uids,

But why the ritial Ohnesorge in (cid:29)uid 2 is about 20

times higher than the ritial Ohnesorge in (cid:29)uid 1? Why

(cid:29)uid 1 is more able to damp apillary waves than (cid:29)uid

less than the ritial Ohnesorge for partial oalesene

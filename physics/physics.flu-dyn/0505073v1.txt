We present the dynamic velocity proﬁles of a Newtonian ﬂuid (glycerol) and a viscoelastic Maxwell
ﬂuid (CPyCl/NaSal in water) driven by an oscillating pressure gradient in a vertical cylindrical pipe.
The frequency range explored has been chosen to include the ﬁrst three resonance peaks of the dy-
namic permeability of the viscoelastic ﬂuid / pipe system. Three diﬀerent optical measurement
techniques have been employed. Laser Doppler Anemometry has been used to measure the mag-
nitude of the velocity at the centre of the liquid column. Particle Image Velocimetry and Optical
Deﬂectometry are used to determine the velocity proﬁles at the bulk of the liquid column and at
the liquid–air interface respectively. The velocity measurements in the bulk are in good agreement
with the theoretical predictions of a linear theory. The results, however, show dramatic diﬀerences
in the dynamic behaviour of Newtonian and viscoelastic ﬂuids, and demonstrate the importance of
resonance phenomena in viscoelastic ﬂuid ﬂows, bioﬂuids in particular, in conﬁned geometries.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Coupling between ﬂow and liquid structure
makes the dynamic response of non–Newtonian
(complex) ﬂuids much richer than that of Newto-
nian (simple) ﬂuids [1, 2]. In particular, depending
on the relevant time scale of the ﬂow, viscoelastic
ﬂuids exhibit the dissipative behaviour of ordinary
viscous liquids and the elastic response of solids.
Due to their elastic properties, these ﬂuids are po-
tential candidates to exhibit interesting resonance
phenomena under diﬀerent ﬂow conditions.

In this respect, the response of a viscoelastic ﬂuid
to an oscillatory pressure gradient has been anal-
ysed theoretically in some detail. The response,
measured in terms of the velocity for a given am-
plitude of the pressure gradient, exceeds that of an
ordinary ﬂuid by several orders of magnitude at a
number of resonant frequencies. The remarkable
enhancement in the dynamic response of the vis-
coelastic ﬂuid is attributed to a resonant eﬀect due
to the elastic behaviour of the ﬂuid and the geom-
etry of the container [3, 4, 5, 6].

This theoretical prediction has been recently con-
ﬁrmed by Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) mea-
surements of velocity at the centre of a ﬂuid column
driven by an oscillating pressure gradient [7]. The
experiments show that a Newtonian ﬂuid exhibits a
simple dissipative behaviour, while a Maxwell ﬂuid
(the simplest viscoelastic ﬂuid) exhibits the reso-
nant behaviour predicted by the linear theory at
the expected driving frequencies. While this anal-

ysis was performed in the central point of the ﬂuid
column, an exploration of the whole velocity ﬁeld is
necessary to ensure that the linear model captures
the main features of the ﬂow.

≫

Resonance eﬀects can only be observed when the
elastic behaviour of the ﬂuid is dominant. This is
properly characterised by a dimensionless number
1, where De (Deborah number) measures the
De
relative importance of the relaxation time of the
ﬂuid to the typical time scale of the ﬂow. More-
over, at the resonant driving frequencies the system
response is nearly purely elastic and the dissipative
eﬀects are very small.

In the present paper we extend the previous ex-
perimental investigation in several directions.
In
the ﬁrst place we present new LDA measurements
for two Maxwell ﬂuids of diﬀerent composition, and
show that the linear theory correctly predicts the
location of the resonance frequencies in terms of
material parameters. In addition, measurements at
diﬀerent depths along the column centre show the
attenuation of the velocity as the upper free inter-
face is approached. The main result is the determi-
nation of the velocity proﬁles in the radial direction
of the cylindrical tube, at several time intervals and
driving frequencies. We have measured the velocity
proﬁles at two diﬀerent locations: the bulk of the
liquid column, and the upper liquid–air interface.
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) has been used in
the former case, and an original technique based
on Optical Deﬂectometry (OD) in the latter. The
PIV results compare satisfactorily with the velocity

proﬁles predicted by the linear theory [8]. The OD
results show the attenuation of the velocity due to
surface tension.

II. LINEAR THEORY

In this section we recall the theoretical expression
of the velocity ﬁeld in the bulk of a viscoelastic ﬂuid
contained in a vertical tube, and subjected to an os-
cillating pressure gradient [7, 8]. The tube is sup-
posed to be inﬁnite in the vertical direction. The
derivation is based on a linear approximation of the
hydrodynamic equations and a linearized constitu-
tive equation for a Maxwell ﬂuid [3, 4, 5].

Following Ref. [7], the velocity ﬁeld in Fourier’s

frequency domain reads:

V (r, ω) =

−
ηβ2

(cid:18)

−

J0(βr)

.

(1)

In this expression r, z are the radial and vertical
cylindrical coordinates in a reference system cen-
tered with the tube axis, ω = 2πν, where ν is
the driving frequency, tm is the relaxation time of
the Maxwell ﬂuid, η its dynamic viscosity, β =
ρ [(tmω)2 + iωtm] /(ηtm), a is the cylinder ra-
dius, J0 is the cylindrical Bessel function of zeroth
p
order, and P is the applied pressure in Fourier’s
frequency domain.

In our experiment, oscillations of the pressure
gradient are induced by the harmonic motion of a
piston at the bottom end of the ﬂuid column, with
amplitude z0 (Figure 1). Thus,

dp(t)
dz

= ρz0ω2 sin(ωt).

The velocity proﬁle in the radial direction of the
tube, at the driving frequency ω, is then given by
the real part of the following expression:

v(r, t) =

For a Newtonian ﬂuid (tm = 0) there is only one
node of the velocity proﬁle, at r = a, which ac-
counts for the non–slip condition at the wall. Re-
= 0 (Maxwellian ﬂuid) the velocity

proﬁle may present several nodes. These nodes de-
ﬁne quiescent points of the ﬂow. For given mate-
rial and geometrical parameters, the location of the
nodes depends on the driving frequency, as shown
in Fig. 2.

As mentioned in the Introduction, the elastic
properties of the ﬂuid dominate the dynamic re-
sponse of the system at the resonant frequencies.

III. EXPERIMENTAL DEVICE

The experimental device is shown in Fig. 1. The
cylindrical container (inner radius a = 25 mm,
length 500 mm) is made of transparent acrylic.
In order to avoid optical aberrations this cylin-
der is placed inside a second recipient of square
section, made also of transparent acrylic, which is
ﬁlled with glycerol to match the refractive index
of the acrylic walls. A Teﬂon piston driven by a
motor of variable frequency produces harmonic os-
cillations of the pressure gradient in the liquid col-
umn. Although the motor controller can operate
in the frequency range from 1.5 to 200 Hz, our
experiments have been performed in the reduced
frequency range from 1.5 to 15 Hz. The piston os-
0.05 mm to keep
cillation amplitude is set to 0.80
the Reynolds number low, within the accessible fre-
quency range, for the two ﬂuids studied. Additional
details of this part of the setup are described in Ref.
[7].

±

The viscoelastic ﬂuid used in these experiments
is an aqueous solution of cetylpyridinium chloride
and sodium salicylate (CPyCl/NaSal). This sur-
factant solution is known to exhibit the rheologi-
cal behaviour of a linear Maxwell ﬂuid in a range
of concentrations [9, 10]. In most experiments we
have used a 60/100 concentration, for which the dy-
namic viscosity η = 60 Pa
s, the density ρ = 1050
·
kg/m3, and the relaxation time tm = 1.9 s [11]. In
DLA measurements we have also used a 40/40 con-
s, ρ = 1005 kg/m3,
centration, for which η = 30 Pa
·
and relaxation time around tm = 1.25 s. Our rhe-
ological characterisation of this last ﬂuid, however,
suggests that it cannot be fully described by a sin-
gle relaxation time. As Newtonian ﬂuid we have
used commercial glycerol, with nominal dynamic
s and density ρ = 1250 kg/m3.

temperature of (25
All sets of measurements performed on the same
ﬂuid have been carried out in order of increasing
frequency. The cylinder has been emptied and re-
ﬁlled with fresh ﬂuid every time that a series of
measurements at three diﬀerent driving frequencies
was complete, i.e. approximately every day. Mea-
surements in the bulk have been carried out at two
diﬀerent heights, corresponding to distances of 6
and 10 cm from the upper free interface.

The LDA technique used in the measurements

A. Particle Image Velocimetry

The PIV technique provides instant measures of
the velocity maps in a plane of the ﬂow [12]. To
this purpose, the ﬂuid is seeded with small parti-
cles. The velocity maps are obtained by a measure
of the statistical correlation of the displacement of
the seeding particles in the ﬂuid in a known time
interval, in this case the time between two consec-
utive laser pulses.

Our PIV system contains a two pulsed Nd-YAG
lasers unit, that includes an optical array to pro-
duce a laser light sheet in a vertical plane of the
acrylic cylinder (Fig. 1). A high resolution cam-
era (Kodak E1.0), perpendicular to the laser light
sheet, is used to record the digital images. The
camera records two consecutive frames, one corre-
sponding to each laser light pulse. The acquisi-
tion rate is limited by the camera to three pairs
of images every two seconds (1.5 Hz). A Dan-
tec FlowMap 1100 processor takes care of the syn-
chronization between the laser pulses and the cam-
era trigger. Post–processing of the data, to deter-
mine velocity maps, is carried out by the Dantec
FlowMap v5.1 software. Dantec 20–µm polyamid
spheres were used as seeding particles in the present
experiments. These particles are small enough to
follow the ﬂow with minimal drag, but suﬃciently
large to scatter enough light to obtain good particle
images.

B. Optical Deﬂectometry

Deﬂectometry is a technique used to study rela-
tively small deformations in transparent ﬂuid sur-
faces [13]. In our case the liquid column serves as
a variable–thickness lens. A thin transparent plas-
tic sheet with a regular array (grid spacing d) of
black dots (0.5 mm diameter) is placed on top of
the Teﬂon piston, at the bottom of the acrylic cylin-
der (Fig. 1). The grid is imaged through the liquid
column using a CCD camera interfaced to a com-
puter. Light passing through the liquid column is
refracted at the liquid–air interface, distorting the
image of the grid as the interface deforms. Figure
3 presents an example of the recorded images.

The displacement of an imaged grid point, δ, is
related to the local slope of the interface, φ, in the

FIG. 3: A typical picture recorded in Optical Deﬂec-
tometry measurements. The image of a regular array
of black dots (grid spacing d = 5.0 mm) is distorted by
the interface deformation.

smooth proﬁles, and the condition of small defor-
mations is satisﬁed in a wide range of frequencies.
Although the deformations are small in this fre-
quency range, the whole deformation proﬁle de-
pends strongly on the frequency of driving. This
can be seen on the theoretical deformation pro-
ﬁles of the viscoelastic ﬂuid at 2 and 6.5 Hz, dis-
played in Fig. 5. The two proﬁles are very diﬀer-
ent. While the deformation proﬁle at 2 Hz is mono-
tonic and very smooth, the proﬁle at 6.5 Hz shows a
more complex behaviour: instead of a single central
node, it presents two nodes which, in the velocity
proﬁle, correspond to a maximum at the tube cen-
tre and a minimum near the tube wall. The max-
imum deformation between these two nodes corre-
sponds to an inﬂection point of the velocity proﬁle,
very close to the quiescent ﬂow point.

In our setup the height of the liquid column is a
function of the radial coordinate r, and periodic in
time. This height, h(r, t), is simply related to the
local slope by φ(r, t) = ∂h(r, t)/∂r. Hence:

OD is usually used in thin ﬁlms. The deﬂection
of the points of the grid increases with the depth

measurement of highly deformed interfaces of thick
layers. However, the small amplitude of the per-
turbation in our experiments generates relatively

It is useful to choose for r0 a position where the
interface is motionless, because the reference height
h(r0, t) is then a constant that can be taken equal
to 0. We have chosen r0 as the radial coordinate
of the quiescent ﬂow point (in the bulk) closest to
the cylinder axis. Implicitly, we are assuming that
the stagnation points predicted by Eq. (3) for the
bulk do not change their position as the interface is
approached. This assumption is conﬁrmed by our
PIV and OD results (see Sec. IV).

Finally, the velocity proﬁle of the interface can
be obtained from the time derivative of the local
height, v(r, t) = ∂h(r, t)/∂t.

In our experiments the grid spacings used are
d = 5.0 and 5.5 mm, and the refractive indices
are n = 1.33407(01) for the CPyCl/NaSal solution
(measured by Abb´e refractometry), and n = 1.473
for glycerol (nominal).

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A.

rms velocity at the cylinder axis

The amplitude of the velocity ﬁeld given by Eq.
(1) presents resonance peaks at several resonance
frequencies. As mentioned in the Introduction, this
phenomenon was demonstrated experimentally and
compared to the purely dissipative behaviour of a
Newtonian ﬂuid in Ref. [7]. These results showed
that the linear theory gives a good prediction of the
resonance frequencies but overestimates the ampli-
tude of the resonance peaks.

We have repeated this same kind of measure-
ments in the present work, to check the depen-
dence of the resonance frequencies on the rheolog-
ical properties of the Maxwell ﬂuid. To this pur-
pose the driving frequency ω has been rescaled by
a characteristic time τ deﬁned as

τ = 102/5tm√α,

(6)

where α is the inverse of our Deborah number
De = tmη/a2ρ. As it was shown in Ref. [5], the
location of the resonance peaks becomes universal
(independent of ﬂuid parameters and system di-
mensions) if ω is made dimensionless in the form
ωτ .

Then, we rewrite Eq. (1) in the form

the tube (r = 0), for the two diﬀerent concentra-
tions of the CPyCl/NaSal solution used, are shown
in Fig. 6. Comparison with the linear theory is
given by the vertical dashed lines, which give the
resonance frequencies corresponding to maxima of
ξ(r = 0, ω). The Figure shows that the rescaling
of the frequency axis suggested by the linear the-
ory leads to a satisfactory reproducibility of the
resonance frequencies independently of viscoelastic
ﬂuid parameters.

FIG. 6: Dimensionless response function at the centre
of the cylinder, as a function of dimensionless driving
frequency, for two concentrations of the CPyCl/NaSal
solution. The vertical dashed lines give the location of
the resonance frequencies predicted by a linear theory.

The magnitude of the response function at the
resonance peaks for the surfactant solution of con-
centration 60/100 is considerably lower in the
present measurements than in the previous ones of
Ref. [7]. The reason is that the present measure-
ments have been carried out at 6 cm of the free air–
liquid interface, while the previous ones had been
taken at 10 cm. The diﬀerent measured velocities
provide a ﬁrst evidence of the damping inﬂuence of
the free interface on the ﬂow.

The results presented in the next two sections
provide measurements of the whole velocity proﬁle,
instead of measurements at a single point in the
ﬂow [7]. The velocity proﬁles are obtained at two
diﬀerent heights, in the bulk of the ﬂuid, and at the
ﬂuid-air interface.

B. Velocity proﬁles in the bulk

The following set of ﬁgures presents the velocity
proﬁles in the bulk of the ﬂuid column, determined
by PIV measurements, together with the theoret-
ical proﬁles given by Eq. (3) at coincident time–
phases, for comparison. The proﬁles have been de-
termined at the driving frequencies of 2 Hz (Figs. 7
and 8), 6.5 Hz (Figs. 9 and 10), and 10 Hz (Figs. 11
and 12). These values coincide with the ﬁrst three
resonance frequencies of our system for the 60/100
viscoelastic solution, as given by Eq. (3). The time–
phases have been selected by the criterion that the

velocity at the tube axis is a maximum.

The ﬁrst observation to make is that the in-
stantaneous velocity proﬁles of the Maxwell ﬂuid,
driven at 2 Hz, present a single deﬁned sign of ve-
locity (single direction of motion) along the whole
radius of the tube. As the driving frequency is in-
creased to 6.5 and 10 Hz, however, the instanta-
neous proﬁles display a progressively more com-
plex structure, revealing the presence of annu-
lar regions within the tube with alternating up-
ward/downward motion. Notice that this com-
plexity is inherent to the viscoelastic properties of
the Maxwell ﬂuid. For the Newtonian ﬂuid (glyc-
erol) the instantaneous ﬂow in the tube goes all in

the same direction for the three driving frequencies
tested.

For the viscoelastic ﬂuid the frontiers between
consecutive annular regions with alternating signs
of the velocity do not move. They correspond to
the stagnation regions of the ﬂow which were al-
ready discussed in the context of the linear theory.
The PIV results show that the number of quiescent
ﬂow points along the radial direction of the tube
increases with the driving frequency, in agreement
with the theoretical prediction (Fig. 2).

Some of the measured proﬁles of the viscoelastic
ﬂuid show regions near the walls with vanishingly
small velocities and near zero velocity gradients,
most noticeably the one at 2 Hz shown in Fig. 8.

These proﬁles are reminiscent of velocity proﬁles
obtained for systems that display shear–banding.
Indeed, the CPyCl/NaSal solution is commonly
known to show shear-banding [14], but we have
enough evidence to discard this eﬀect in our experi-
ments. We did not observe an increase in turbidity
in the region of the ﬂuid close to the walls, nor
changes in the local intensity of the scattered light
that could be attributed to inhomogeneities. Fur-
thermore, we monitored possible changes on the po-
larization state of the scattered light, an indication
of banding [15]. No changes in the optical proper-
ties were observed for the amplitude and frequency
range used here. In addition, Fig. 13 demonstrates
that the velocity near the walls takes values dis-

tinctly diﬀerent from zero at diﬀerent phases within
an oscillation period.

Performing PIV measurements at two diﬀerent
heights of the liquid column allows studying the in-
ﬂuence of the upper free interface on the velocity
proﬁles. Thus, it is interesting to compare the re-
sults presented above, which have been performed
at 6 cm from the upper interface, to the results
shown in Figs. 14 and 15, which have been per-
formed at 10 cm from the upper interface. The
ﬁrst conclusion to draw from corresponding mea-
surements at diﬀerent heights is that the location
of the quiescent ﬂow points is not aﬀected by the
presence of the upper free interface. The second
conclusion is that the magnitude of the velocity
proﬁle is smaller when the measurement is carried
out closer to the free interface. The damping ef-
fect of the free interface, disregarded in the theory,
originates from the air–liquid surface tension. This
observation applies equally to the two ﬂuids inves-
tigated (Newtonian and Maxwellian).

The experimental velocity proﬁles are in reason-
able agreement with the theoretical ones. The num-
ber of quiescent ﬂow points is the same, and their
location very similar. As a general trend, however,
the theory overestimates the measured velocity.

A ﬁrst explanation would be that the theory dis-
regards nonlinearities, and these tend to limit the
largest velocity values. Nonlinearities could arise
from either the hydrodynamic equations or the con-
stitutive relation of the ﬂuid.
In our case, how-
ever, since the small amplitude of the piston oscilla-
tions ensures that Re< 10−4, the linearized momen-
tum equation is a very good approximation. On
the other hand, taking into account the cylindrical
symmetry of the problem and assuming that the

velocity depends only on the radial coordinate (as
our results conﬁrm to a very good approximation),
it turns out that the ﬁrst nonlinear correction to
the constitutive equation of the ﬂuid cancels out
exactly.

The disagreement between theory and experi-
ment is probably due to shear–thinning of the vis-
coelastic ﬂuid. As shown in Ref. [11], our ﬂuid is
properly described by a Maxwell model up to shear
0.6 s−1, and experiences shear–thinning
rates γ
beyond that value. A close inspection of Figs. 8,

≃

10, and 12 reveals that the shear rate actually ex-
perienced by the ﬂuid in some phase intervals of the
oscillation is larger [7]. In these conditions the vis-
cosity of the ﬂuid decreases with shear. The theory
predicts that the dynamic response of the system
at the resonant frequencies becomes smaller as the
viscosity is reduced [5], and thus would support the
view that the measured velocity proﬁles are system-
atically smaller than the theoretical ones for the
viscoelastic ﬂuid (and not for the newtonian ﬂuid)
because of shear–thinning.

C. Deﬂection of the air–liquid interface

The results obtained by Optical Deﬂectometry
are presented on top of Figs. 16 and 17 (2 Hz), and
Figs. 18 and 19 (6.5 Hz). There are no results at 10
Hz because, at this driving frequency, the deforma-
tions of the free interface of the Maxwellian ﬂuid
are so large that the technique is not applicable.
Each ﬁgure displays measurements at two diﬀerent
time–phases.

The experimental deformation proﬁles of the in-
terface at 2 and 6.5 Hz for the viscoelastic ﬂuid can
be compared to the theoretical ones (computed for
the bulk) displayed in Fig. 5. We observe that their
shapes are fully coincident for each of the two driv-
ing frequencies. This shows that the quiescent ﬂow
points of the velocity proﬁles do not change their
position along the vertical direction, and thus their
location in the bulk can be used as reference to
compute the velocity proﬁles at the interface from
the deformation proﬁles.

The velocity proﬁles are presented on the bottom
of Figs. 16 and 17 (2 Hz), and Figs. 18 and 19 (6.5
Hz). The magnitude of the interfacial velocities is
in all cases much lower than the one measured in
the bulk of the ﬂuid. This is mostly due to the sta-
bilizing role of surface tension, as discussed above.

It is interesting to note that the velocity proﬁles
of the interface depend also on the direction of mo-
tion of the driving piston. The magnitude of the ve-
locity is systematically lower for positive displace-
ments of the piston (liquid displacing air) than for
negative ones (air displacing liquid). We attribute
this asymmetry to the fact that the large viscosity
contrast across the interface stabilizes the displace-
ment of a nearly inviscid ﬂuid (air) by a viscous
liquid, and destabilizes the opposite displacement.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have used three diﬀerent optical techniques
to characterize the oscillating ﬂow of a viscoelas-
tic ﬂuid (a solution of CPyCl/NaSal in water) con-
tained in a vertical cylinder and subjected to an
oscillating pressure gradient. A Newtonian ﬂuid
(glycerol) has also been studied for the sake of com-
parison.

LDA measurements of the ﬂuid velocity at the
symmetry axis of the cylinder as a function of driv-
ing frequency, for two diﬀerent compositions of the

surfactant solution, have enabled us to show that
the frequencies of the resonance peaks can be pre-
dicted accurately in terms of the ﬂuid rheological
properties by a simple linear theory. This theory
neglects inertial eﬀects, and makes use of a linear
Maxwell model as constitutive relation for the vis-
coelastic ﬂuid.

Systematic PIV measurements of the radial ve-
locity ﬁeld in the bulk of the ﬂuid have been per-
formed at three diﬀerent driving frequencies, close
to the ﬁrst three resonance frequencies of the vis-

coelastic system. While the velocity proﬁle of the
Newtonian ﬂuid along the radial direction does not
change sign, this is not the case for the Maxwellian
ﬂuid. The proﬁles measured at 6.5 and 10 Hz
present regions with alternating signs of the veloc-
ity, separated by quiescent ﬂow points. The number
of quiescent ﬂow points increases with the driving
frequency, revealing the increasing complexity of
the ﬂow. Measurements within the ﬂuid column
at two diﬀerent heights show that these quiescent
ﬂow points do not shift as one moves along the

vertical direction, and that their radial location is
accurately reproduced by the linear theory.

The presence of a free interface at the top of the
liquid column has a damping eﬀect on the velocity
amplitude. This observation is visible, both with
LDA and PIV, when the results of measurements
carried out at two diﬀerent heights within the liquid
column are compared.

Optical Deﬂectometry measurements of the free
interface conﬁrm that the velocity ﬁeld is severely
damped by the surface tension of the air–liquid in-

f
f
terface, compared to the velocity ﬁeld within the
bulk. Interestingly, the deﬂectometry results show
also that the oscillations of the velocity ﬁeld at the
interface are asymmetric, the proﬁles correspond-
ing to positive displacements of the piston having a
slightly but systematically smaller amplitude than
those corresponding to negative displacements. We
attribute this asymmetry to the fact that the up-
ward motion of the interface (liquid displacing air)
is stabilized by the viscous pressure gradient in the
liquid. Recently it has been suggested that the vis-
cous ﬁngering interfacial instability of a viscoelastic
ﬂuid in a Hele–Shaw cell will be enhanced by mak-
ing the ﬂow oscillate at the resonant frequencies
[16]. Our deﬂectometry results show that the sta-
bilizing role of the surface tension will reduce this
eﬀect to some extent.

These results, as part of the study of resonance
frequencies in viscoelastics, are potentially relevant
in biorheology to interpret the frequencies at which

bioﬂuids are optimally pumped in living organisms
[17].

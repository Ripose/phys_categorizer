Exact second-order structure-function
relationships

Reginald J. Hill

February 2, 2008

Abstract

Equations that follow from the Navier-Stokes equation and incom-
pressibility but with no other approximations are “exact.”. Exact equa-
tions relating second- and third-order structure functions are studied, as
is an exact incompressibility condition on the second-order velocity struc-
ture function. Opportunities for investigations using these equations are
discussed. Precisely deﬁned averaging operations are required to obtain
exact averaged equations. Ensemble, temporal, and spatial averages are
all considered because they produce diﬀerent statistical equations and
because they apply to theoretical purposes, experiment, and numerical
simulation of turbulence. Particularly simple exact equations are ob-
tained for the following cases: i) the trace of the structure functions, ii)
DNS that has periodic boundary conditions, and iii) an average over a
sphere in r-space. The last case (iii) introduces the average over orienta-
tions of r into the structure function equations. The energy dissipation
rate ε appears in the exact trace equation without averaging, whereas in
previous formulations ε appears after averaging and use of local isotropy.
The trace mitigates the eﬀect of anisotropy in the equations, thereby re-
vealing that the trace of the third-order structure function is expected
to be superior for quantifying asymptotic scaling laws. The orientation
average has the same property.

1 Introduction

Equations relating statistics for turbulence studies, such as Kolmogorov’s
(1941) equation are asymptotic equations. This has required experimenters
to seek turbulence that satisﬁes the criteria of the asymptotic state. The
present approach is to derive exact statistical equations. These can be used to
determine all eﬀects contributing to the balance of statistical equations. By
“exact” we mean that the equations follow from the Navier–Stokes equation and
the incompressibility condition with no additional approximations.

Exact equations have the potential to detect the limitations of direct
numerical simulation (DNS) and of experiments and to study the approach to
local homogeneity and local isotropy and scaling laws (Hill 2001). For those

1

purposes, the averaging operation must be exactly deﬁned and implemented;
that is done here. The methods developed here can be used on the exact
structure-function equations of all orders N ; those equations are in Hill (2001).
It is useful to further investigate the exact second-order (N = 2) equation,
which relates second- and third-order structure functions, because it has special
simpliﬁcations that the higher-order equations (N > 2) do not possess and
because the second-order equation is the most familiar. Exact equations satisfy
the need perceived by Yaglom (1998) for careful derivation of dynamic-theory
equations and the perceived value placed by Sreenivasan & Antonia (1997) on
aspects of turbulence that can be understood precisely. Experimental data have
been used to evaluate the balance of Kolmogorov’s equation (Antonia, Chambers
& Browne 1983; Chambers & Antonia 1984) and generalizations of it (Lindborg
1999; Danaila et al. 1999 a,b; Antonia et al. 2000). This report supports such
experimental work as well as precise use of DNS by giving exact equations to
be used in such evaluations. The connection between the derivations presented
here and any experiment or DNS is important because the equations relate
several statistics and therefore are most revealing when data are substituted
into them.

The equations derived here are exact for every ﬂow, whether laminar or
turbulent, provided that no forces act on the ﬂuid at the points of measurement,
which points are denoted below by x and x′. Forces can be applied near the
point of measurement; e.g., the equations are exact for hot-wire anemometer
supports just downstream of the measurement points. The cases of forces
at the points of measurement and throughout the ﬂuid are considered in Hill
(2002), wherein the Kolmogorov ﬂow computed by Borue & Orszag (1996) is
used as a speciﬁc example.

The ensemble average is typically used for theoretical studies, the tem-
poral average for experimental data, and the spatial average for data from DNS;
thus all three are employed here. Ensemble, time and space averages are not
interchangeable because the averages commute diﬀerently with diﬀerential op-
erators within the dynamical equations. For the homogeneous case and inﬁnite
averaging volume, the spatially averaged equation (25) and the ensemble aver-
aged equation (17) reduce to the same form, and similarly for the temporally
averaged equation for the stationary case and inﬁnite averaging time.

Ongoing interest in turbulence intermittency includes accurate evalua-
tion of inertial-range exponents of structure functions, for which purpose precise
deﬁnition of an observed inertial range is needed. The third-order structure
function can serve this purpose because it has a well-known inertial-range power
law and the 4/5 coeﬃcient (Kolmogorov 1941). Deviations from the 4/5 coeﬃ-
cient are observed in experiments (Anselmet, Gagne & Hopﬁnger 1984, observe
values greater than 4/5 in duct ﬂow and less than 4/5 in jet ﬂow despite the
Reynolds numbers being nearly equal; Mydlarski & Warhaft 1996 and Lindborg
1999 obtain values less than 4/5, etc.); this casts doubt on the precision with
which measured exponents apply to the intermittency phenomenon (Sreenivasan
& Dhruva, 1998). The equations derived here, when evaluated with data, can
reveal all eﬀects contributing to the deviation from Kolmogorov’s 4/5 law and

2

his equation.

The plan of the paper is to develop the mathematics in §2 and §3; §2
contains necessary deﬁnitions and unaveraged equations; §3.1-3.3 contain the
deﬁnition of averaging operations and their application to produce averaged
§3.4 contains the simpliﬁcations for the case of spatially periodic
equations.
§3.5 deﬁnes the sphere average in r space and its associated orienta-
DNS.
tion average and relates these to the work of Kolmogorov (1962) and Obukhov
(1962); Kolmogorov’s equation is derived in §3.6 as a useful point of reference.
Discussion of opportunities that these equations present for future investigations
is in §4.

2 Exact unaveraged two-point equations

The equations given here relate two-point quantities and are obtained from
the Navier–Stokes equations and incompressibility. The two spatial points are
denoted x and x′; they are independent variables. They have no relative motion;
e.g., anemometers at x and x′ are ﬁxed relative to one another. To be concise,
i = ui(x′, t), energy dissipation rates by
velocities are denoted ui = ui(x, t), u′
ε = ε(x, t), ε′ = ε(x′, t) ,etc. p is the pressure divided by the density (density
is constant), ν is kinematic viscosity, and ∂ denotes partial diﬀerentiation with

Of course, all quantities above are local and instantaneous quantities.

As a check, one sees that (12) can be obtained from equation (2.9) of Hill (2001).
The trace of (12) and substitution of (9) and (11) gives

∂tdii + ∂Xn

̥iin + ∂rndiin = 2ν∂rn ∂rn dii − 2 (ε + ε′) + w,

(13)

where

w = −2∂Xi [(p − p′) (ui − u′

i)] +

∂Xn ∂Xn dii − 2ν∂Xn ∂Xn (p + p′) .

The ﬁrst term in (14) is −τ ii from (11) and the last term in (14) arises from
eii in (9); the disparate terms in (14) are given the symbol w for subsequent
convenience and brevity. The limit r → 0 applied to (13) recovers the deﬁnition
of ε in (10).

3 Exact averaged two-point equations

3.1 Ensemble average: exact equations

The ensemble average is deﬁned at each point (X, r, t) as the arithmetical
average over the ensemble. We denote the ensemble average by angle brack-
ets and subscript E: h◦iE. Because the ensemble averaging operation is a

4

summation, it commutes with diﬀerential operators, the average of (12) is

∂t hdij iE + ∂Xn h̥ijniE + ∂rn hdijniE

= − hτ ij iE + 2ν

∂rn ∂rn hdij iE +

(cid:18)

∂Xn ∂Xn hdij iE − heijiE(cid:19)

.

(17)

4

The argument list for each tensor in (17) is (X, r, t); the ensemble average does
not eliminate dependence on any independent variable. The average of (13) is

∂t hdiiiE + ∂Xn h̥iiniE + ∂rn hdiiniE = 2ν∂rn ∂rn hdiiiE − 2 hε + ε′iE + hwiE .
(18)
Exact incompressibility conditions on the second-order velocity struc-

ture function are given by the ensemble averages of (15) and (16):

3.2 Temporal average: exact equations

Because nearly continuous temporal sampling is typical, we represent the
temporal average by an integral, but all results are valid for the sum of discrete
points as well. The temporal average is most useful when the turbulence is
nearly statistically stationary. Let t0 be the start time of the temporal average
of duration T . The operator eﬀecting the temporal average of any quantity Q
is denoted by h◦iT , which has argument list (X, r,t0, T ); that is,

hQiT ≡

t0+T

1
T Z

t0

Q (X, r, t) dt.

(21)

The argument list (X, r,t0, T ) is suppressed. The temporal average of (12–16)
gives equations that are the same form as (17–20) with one exception. The
exception is that ∂t does not commute with the integral operator (21) such that
h∂tdij iT appears, whereas ∂t hdij iE appears in (17), and similarly for the trace
equation (18). Because data are taken at x and x′ in the rest frame of the
anemometers, and ∂t is the time derivative for that reference frame, it follows
that

h∂tdij iT ≡

t0+T

1
T Z

t0

∂tdij dt = [dij (X, r, t0 + T ) − dij (X, r, t0)] /T.

(22)

This shows that it is easy to evaluate h∂tdij iT using experimental data because
only the ﬁrst (at t = t0) and last (at t = t0 + T ) data in the time series are
used. One can make h∂tdijiT as small as one desires by allowing T to be very
large provided that dij (X, r, t0 + T ) does not diﬀer greatly from dij (X, r, t0).
This is aided by judicious choice of t0 and t0 + T for the stationary case, but is
not possible in all cases.

3.3 Spatial average: exact equations

Because nearly continuous spatial sampling is typical of DNS, we represent
the spatial average by an integral, but all results can be generalized to the case
of a sum of discrete points. Let the spatial average be over a region R in X-
space. The spatial average of any quantity Q is denoted by hQiR which has
argument list (r, t, R); that is,

hQiR ≡

Q (X, r, t) dX,

(23)

1
V Z Z Z

R

where V is the volume of the space region R. The argument list (r, t, R)
is suppressed. The spatial average commutes with r and t diﬀerential and
integral operations, and with ensemble, time, and r-space averages, but not
with ∂Xn . Given any vector qn, the divergence theorem relates the volume
average of ∂Xn qn to the surface average; that is,

h∂Xn qniR ≡

(24)

where S is the surface area bounding R, dS is the diﬀerential of surface area,
and ˇNn is the unit vector oriented outward and normal to the surface. As
seen on the right-hand side of (24), we adopt, for brevity, the integral-operator
notation

3.4 Spatial average: DNS with periodic boundary condi-

tions

The spatial average is particularly relevant to DNS. DNS that is used to
investigate turbulence at small scales often has periodic boundary conditions.
For such DNS, consider the spatial average over the entire DNS domain. Con-
qn from opposite sides of the averaging volume cancel for that
tributions to

In (25) we then have

̥iin = 0 and hwiR = 0.

In (27), the right-hand side vanishes so that ∂rn hdjniR = 0. Thus, in the DNS

case described above, we have

qn = 0 and therefore h∂Xn qniR = 0.

∂t hdiiiR + ∂rn hdiiniR = 2ν∂rn ∂rn hdiiiR − 2 hε + ε′iR ,

∂rn hdjniR = 0, and ∂rn hejniR = 0.

Proof of ∂rn hejniR = 0 is given in Hill (2002).

Performing the r-space divergence of (29) and using (31), we have

∂rj ∂rn hdijniR = −∂rj hτ ij iR .

This exact result is analogous to the asymptotic result in Frisch (1995), Lindborg
(1996), and Hill (1997).

Using the Taylor series of ε and ε′ around the point X, Hill (2002)

obtains the following exact result for the periodic DNS case considered

−2 hε + ε′iR = −4 hε (X, t)iR , and − heij iR = −4ν

R ,
(33)
(cid:11)
where the subscript x = X means that the derivatives are evaluated at the point
X. An important aspect of (33) is that the right-hand sides depend only on t.
Of course, none of (29–32) depends on X because of the spatial average over X.
No approximations have been used to obtain the above equations for

[(∂xn ui) (∂xnuj)]x=X
(cid:10)

the spatially periodic DNS case considered.

3.5 Averages over an r-space sphere

The energy dissipation rate averaged over a sphere in r-space has been
a recurrent theme in small-scale similarity theories since its introduction by
Obukhov (1962) and Kolmogorov (1962). By averaging our equations for the
trace, we can, for the ﬁrst time, produce an exact dynamical equation containing
the sphere-averaged energy dissipation rate. The volume average over an r-
space sphere of radius rS of a quantity Q is denoted by

hQir-sphere ≡

(cid:0)

(36)

Because r, X, and t are independent variables, the r-space volume and ori-
entation averages commute with time and X-space averages and with X- and
t-diﬀerential operators, and, of course, with the ensemble average as well. For
instance,

h∂t hdiiiRir-sphere = ∂t hhdiiiRir-sphere =

h∂tdiiir-sphere

= ∂t

hdiiir-sphere

The r-sphere average (34) can operate on all of the above structure-
function equations; it can operate on unaveraged equations (12) and (13) as well.
These equations have terms of the form ∂rn qn; e.g., qn = hdijniR, ∂rn hdiiiR,
hdiiniE, hdijniT , ∂rn hdiiiT , etc. By means of (36), the volume average in r-space
of any term of the form ∂rnqn produces the orientation average of qn within the
subject equation. After operating on (18) with the volume average in r-space
(34), the term −2 hε + ε′iE in that equation produces −2

for the freely-decaying spatially-periodic DNS case considered; (37) applies to
inhomogeneous and anisotropic DNS that have periodic boundary conditions.

the term proportional to ν.

3.6 Kolmogorov’s equation derived from (37)

Most readers are familiar with Kolmogorov’s (1941) famous equation that
is valid for locally isotropic turbulence. A useful point of reference is to derive
it from (37). This helps elucidate (37). An index 1 denotes projection in the
direction of r, and indices 2 and 3 denote orthogonal directions perpendicular
to r. For locally isotropic turbulence we recall that the only nonzero compo-
nents of hdijniR are hd111iR, hd221iR = hd331iR, and of hdijiR are hd11iR, and
hd22iR = hd33iR. These components depend only on r such that there is no
distinction in an r-space sphere average between rS and r; thus, we simplify
the notation by replacing rS with r. The isotopic-tensor formula for hdijniR
gives hdiiniR = (rn/r) (hd111iR + 2 hd221iR) = (rn/r) hdii1iR, substitution of
hdiiniR = (rn/r) hdiiniR = (rn/r) (rn/r) hdii1iR =
which into (35) gives
∂rn hdiiiR = (rn/r) (∂rn r) ∂r hdiiiR =
hdii1iR. Since (∂rn r) = (rn/r), we have
rn
∂r hdiiiR. Kolmogorov (1941) considered the locally stationary case such that
H
he neglected the time-derivative term, thus we also neglect that term to obtain
from (37) that

rn

H

hdii1iR = 2ν∂r hdiiiR −

hεiR r.

(38)

Alternatively, we can time average (37); then the time derivative can be ne-
glected with the weaker condition noted with respect to the smallness of (22);
then hhdii1iRiT = 2ν∂r hhdiiiRiT − 4
3 hhεiRiT r. For simplicity of notation, we
continue with (38). To eliminate hd22iR and hhd221iRi from the expressions
hdiiiR = hd11iR + 2 hd22iR and hdii1iR = hd111iR + 2 hd221iR, we use the in-
compressibility conditions r
2 ∂r hd11iR + hd11iR − hd22iR = 0, and r∂r hd111iR +
hd111iR − 6 hd221iR = 0, which are valid for local isotropy (Hill 1997), and were

of anisotropy in (17). For the locally stationary case, the anisotropy quantiﬁed

hdii1iE will more accurately show the asymptotic inertial-range power law than
does hd111iE (or hd221iE or hd331iE). This result for the homogeneous case
extends to the locally homogeneous case as follows: For inhomogeneous turbu-
lence, the nonvanishing part of hτ iiiE, i.e., hτ iiiE = 2∂Xi h(p − p′) (ui − u′

[see (11)] is expected to approach zero rapidly as r decreases for two reasons.

i)iE to vanish on the basis of lo-
cal homogeneity. From (14), hwiE contains the terms ν∂Xn ∂Xn hdiiiE /2 and
−2ν∂Xn ∂Xn hp + p′iE; because of the operator ∂Xn ∂Xn , these terms vanish on
the basis of local homogeneity. Thus, all terms in hwiE are negligible for locally
homogeneous turbulence. By performing the trace, it appears that anisotropy
has been signiﬁcantly reduced in (18) relative to in (17) for the high-Reynolds-
number, locally homogeneous case such that the above hypothesis is extended
to locally homogeneous turbulence. The hypothesis should be checked by com-
parison with anisotropic DNS. Evaluation of all terms in (17) and (18) are the
basis for such an investigation. The above discussion holds for temporal and
spatial averages as well.

i)iE vanishes on the basis of local isotropy.

To determine scaling properties of the third-order structure function,
past theory has used the isotropic formulas. One can use an equation like (18)
or its temporal-average analogue without an assumption about the symmetry
properties (e.g., isotropic) of the structure functions by means of the sphere av-
erage in r-space. Without approximation, the r-space sphere average produces
the orientation-averaged third-order structure function. It would seem that the
orientation average mitigates anisotropy eﬀects. Thus, the orientation average

Consider the stationary, homogeneous case. From (18), we are certain

that ∂rn hdiiniE − 2ν∂rn∂rn hdiiiE scales with hε + ε′iE because
(∂rn hdiiniE − 2ν∂rn ∂rn hdiiiE) / hε + ε′iE = −2;

thereby insuring K41 scaling of ∂rn hdiiniE − 2ν∂rn ∂rn hdiiiE despite anisotropy.
In contrast, (17) insures that scaling only if local isotropy is invoked. Anisotropic
DNS can be used to check whether or not K41 scaling is improved by performing
the trace.

∂t hdij iR for freely decaying turbulence, and of hτ ijiR for anisotropic turbulence,
as well as the balance of the oﬀ-diagonal components of (29). Because we have
not introduced a force generating the turbulence and because every point in
the ﬂow enters into the X-space average, the DNS must be freely decaying.
As shown in Hill (2002), it is straightforward to include forces in the equations.
New experimental methods (Su & Dahm 1996) and DNS can completely evaluate
terms in the exact structure-function equations.

4.3 Eﬀect of inhomogeneity on incompressibility condi-

tions

Exact incompressibility relationships (19–20) are obtained that can be used
to quantify the nonzero value of ∂rn hdjniE (or of ∂rn hdjniT , or of ∂rn hdjniR)
If inhomogeneity is only in the streamwise (say 1-

4.4 Quantifying eﬀects of inhomogeneity and anisotropy

on scaling exponents

Sreenivasan & Dhruva (1998) note that one could determine scaling ex-
ponents with greater conﬁdence if one has a theory that exhibits not only the
asymptotic power law but also the trend toward the power law. Such a theory
must require diﬃcult measurements or DNS to evaluate such trends. The equa-
tions given here are the required theory for the third-order structure function,
given that data must be used to evaluate the equations in a manner analogous
to previously cited evaluations.
In fact, it is not possible that exact equations
do not contain the physical eﬀects discussed by Sreenivasan & Dhruva (1998).
They discuss the fact that there is correlation of velocity increments with large-
scale velocity in inhomogeneous turbulence, even for very large Reynolds num-
bers and r in the inertial range, but not so in isotropic turbulence. Our term

terms in the other equations, explicitly contains such correlation, and the bal-
ance of the equations imparts that correlation eﬀect to the other statistics; all
such terms do vanish for isotropic turbulence. They also discuss the usefulness
of graphing all 3 terms in (39) to discern the onset of the dissipation-range.
Our equations are exact there too.

4.5 Quantifying eﬀects of large-scale structure on small-

scale structure

Experimenters remove the mean from an anemometer’s signal before cal-
culating structure functions from the velocity ﬂuctuations, whereas the exact
dynamical equations contain statistics of the full velocity ﬁeld. Hill (2002)
applied the Reynolds decomposition to the above exact dynamical equations,
and used inertial-range and viscous-range asymptotics to determine the approx-
imate dynamical equations pertaining to statistics of ﬂuctuations as well as all
approximations that are required to obtain the approximate equations. The
Reynolds decomposition produces terms that quantify the eﬀect of the large-
scale structure of turbulence on the small scales. For example, ∂Xn h̥ijniE
produces a generalization of the advective term discovered by Lindborg (1999).
Hill (2002) contrasts the various deﬁnitions of local homogeneity and points out
that the only deﬁnition that simpliﬁes dynamical equations is that from Hill
(2001).

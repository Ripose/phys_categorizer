Using high Reynolds number experimental data, we search for most dissipative, most
intense vortices. These structures possess a scaling predicted by log-Poisson model for the
dissipation ﬁeld εr. These new experimental data suggest that the most intense structures
have co-dimension less than 2. The log-Poisson statistics is compared with log-binomial
which follows from the random β-model.

PACS number(s): 47.27.Ak, 47.27.Jv

It is known, at least from numerical simulations, that
the large-amplitude dissipation occurs around vortex
tubes in turbulence. We thus expect some structure to
exist in a signal that characterizes the large values of
the dissipation ﬁeld. There are some statistics, although
very incomplete ones, on the distance between the vor-
tex tubes, the size of vortex tubes, etc.. The largest
value of the dissipation is also important in determin-
ing the resolution of DNS [1]. It would be therefore of
interest to provide a direct experimental study of the dis-
sipative ﬁeld extremal values. On the other hand, very
large values of the dissipation ﬁeld correspond to inter-
mittency. Traditionally, the latter is expressed through
so-called intermittency corrections to the exponents for
the structure functions, h|u(x + r) − u(x)|pi ∼ rζp , where
u is the longitudinal velocity, and ζp = p/3, [2]. Thus,
these corrections result in ζp = p/3 + τ (p/3). A theory,
incorporating the intermittency, the reﬁned similarity hy-
pothesis [3], links the statistic of these corrections with
the statistic of the dissipation ﬁeld εr, the energy dissipa-
ri ∼ rτ (p).
tion averaged over a ball of size r. Namely, hεp
Many models have been proposed to explain intermit-
tency. It was originally suggested that the statistics of
εr is log-normal [3]. More recently, She and L´evˆeque [4]
(hereafter SL, see also [5], [6], and recent study [7]) have
proposed log-Poisson statistics for the dissipation ﬁeld,
with agreement with the experimentally found ζp in [8],
[9]. These experimental exponents are obtained in Ex-
tended Self-Similarity approach, which is useful because
of extended scaling range.

The simplest idea to study large values of dissipation
is to measure the maxima. However, for many distri-
butions a maximum of a big array can be “anything”,
or arbitrary large. This is true, for example, for Gaus-
sian statistics. The same is true for log-normal distribu-
tion. To see this, recall that, ﬁrst, τ (p) = −dp(p − 1),
dp = D − Dp, where Dp are so-called generalized di-
mensions [10]. Second, studying maxima is in a way
equivalent to measuring asymptotically high moments,
d∞ = limp→∞ {−τ (p)/(p − 1)}. For the log-normal dis-
tribution, τ (p) = −µ/2p(p − 1), and therefore asymp-

totically, dp = (µ/2)p → ∞. Remarkably, the Poisson
statistics provide some distinctive maximum. To see this,
recall that for the Poisson distribution (see, e.g., [11]),

P (α, ξ) = e

−ξξα/α!, α = 0, 1, 2, ..., εr = eαa+b,

and a < 0, the maximal value is deﬁned through b =

ln max εr.
ri. Noting that hεri = 1, we get b = ξ(1 − ea),
ments, hεp
where ξ = C ln (ℓ/r), ℓ being external scale, and C is a
constant. As a result (of calculation of the moments), we
get,

τ (p) = C[1 − (1 − γ/C)p] − pγ,

(2)

where γ = C(1 − ea) [12]. Using (2), it is easy to show
that this time d∞ = γ, which is a ﬁnite number.

SL is recovered from (2) if C = 2, γ = 2/3, so that a =
ln (2/3), C being the co-dimension of most dissipative
structures, and γ is deﬁned by the dissipation rate, i.e.,
inverse time-scale, 1/tr ∼ r−2/3 [4].

The meaning of C becomes even more clear directly
from (1): the most intense ﬂuctuations correspond to
α = 0 (as a < 0), so that the probability P (α = 0) =
e−ξ = (r/ℓ)C = (r/ℓ)(D−H0), D is dimension of space
(= 3). Thus the Hausdorﬀ dimension for most dissipative
structures in SL theory, H0 = 1, i.e., the structures are
ﬁlaments. On the other hand, using expressions for b, ξ
and γ, we now rewrite (1) as follows,

εr = eαa max εr = eαa

(cid:16)

Putting α = 0 in (3), we can see that the most intense
structures are expected to scale ∼ r−γ. Thus, for the
the log-Poisson statistics, the maxima of εr(x) are not
“anything”, and they are supposed to be self-similar.

This scaling is proved to be possible to verify exper-
imentally. We used 10 million points of atmospheric
data, with an estimated Taylor microscale Reynolds num-
ber 9540, (experiment A) and 40 million points for both
longitudinal and transfer velocities (experiment B). The
data are treated in spirit of Taylor hypothesis, that is,

the time series is treated as one-dimensional cut of the
process. The dissipation rate can be written as

ε(x) = ν(∂ivj∂ivj + ∂ivj ∂jvi),

(4)

(summation over repeating induces). The second term
on the rhs vanishes after averaging, for homogeneous in-
compressible turbulence. The ﬁrst term consists of 3 lon-
gitudinal and 6 transverse components. Therefore, it is
natural to present the dissipation as

εc(x) = ν

(5)

For isotropic turbulence, h(∂xvy(x))2i = 2h(∂xvx(x))2i,
and therefore, following [13], we may consider three types
of dissipation, longitudinal, transverse,

εl(x) = 15ν (∂xvx(x))2 , εt(x) = (15/2)ν (∂xvy(x))2 ,

In order to compare with a “regular” ran-

correlation function coinciding with experimental, i.e.,

Corresponding calculation for the maxima are reported
in Fig. 1. If any scaling can be extracted from the Gaus-
sian process, it would be at large asymptotic distances,
and the scaling is trivial, γ = 0, meaning no singularity.
Figure 2 presents the scaling for experiment B. This
time, the scaling holds for almost 6 decades. The scaling
exponent for longitudinal dissipation is again 0.61 ± 0.01,
while for the combined dissipation (which is quite close to
the transversal dissipation) the exponent is 0.57 ± 0.01.
In both Figs. 1 and 2 there is also λ-scale. Note that
there is characteristic transfer region at r/λ ≈ 1. We
may interpret it as a transition to the inertial range [14],
which is formed due to the fact that the vortices are
expected to have scales between Kolmogorov microscale
η and Taylor microscale λ.

FIG. 1. Scaling for most intense structures. The power law
ﬁtting of the experimental data (solid thick line) has been
extended to reach unity (solid line), where it is supposed to
match with SL scaling. The distances are given in terms of
Kolmogorov micro-scale η, and in units of λ.

and maxima of εr can be measured. Note that this mea-
surement is meaningful because (7) contains some aver-
age. Figure 1 shows longitudinal scaling for the experi-
ment A, which holds for 4.5 decades. The deviation from
SL is small, and we recall that SL suggest that there is
no anomalous scaling for tr. This small deviation in Fig.
1 can be interpreted as anomalous persistence of the ed-
dies, which is indeed observed [15], see also discussion in
[16]. The value of γ is 0.61 ± 0.01, only slightly smaller

transversal dissipation, including combined dissipation.

Although the experimental γ is not that diﬀerent from
2/3, the value of the other parameter C is quite sensi-
tive to that diﬀerence. In order to ﬁnd C we substitute
γ from our measurements into (2), and use computer
routines to ﬁnd a best ﬁt for these data with free pa-
rameter C and the exponents ζ(ESS)
from experiment
[8], [9]. We start with the longitudinal dissipation (6)
from experiments A and B (recall that γ is the same for
them). As a result, we ﬁnd C = 1.67 and a = −0.45 (cf.
ln {2/3} = −0.41). With these parameters, the deviation

Consider now the combined dissipation, deﬁned in (5).
The best ﬁtting with this parameter ﬁxed results in
C = 1.43, and a = −0.50. This time, the deviation of
the computer generated spectrum from the experimental
is = 0.0071. Figure 3 shows τ (p/3) from experiment, and
for diﬀerent theories. It can be seen that all the curves
collapse into one, corresponding to the experiment, ex-
cept that one with γ from our measurements, and C = 2.
This illustrates that the data are indeed sensitive to the
measured γ, that is to its (small) diﬀerence from 2/3.
The codimension C = 1.43 corresponds to H0 = 1.57.
This value of H0 > 1 seems to be consistent with the
distinction between persistent vortical ﬁlaments and the
dissipative structures associated with regions of strong
strain [18]. That means that the most dissipative struc-
tures consist not only of ﬁlaments, but in part of sheets,
or ﬁlaments convoluted into complex structures, cover-
ing more than 1 dimension. According to the intersec-
tion theorem [19], that D − H0 = D(m) − H (m)
, where
D(m) is the dimension of the measurements (in our case
D(m) = 1), and H (m)
- corresponding measured Haus-

It is clear from this formula that, if
dorﬀ dimension.
H0 < 2 then H (m)
0 < 0. This actually means that the
dimension H0 < 2 cannot be detected in 1D measure-
ments directly, and therefore our conclusion is inevitably
indirect. Indeed, it is obtained from spectrum (2), really
formed in 3D, but projected into 1D assuming isotropy.
Therefore, it would be important to measure the Haus-
dorﬀ dimension in 3D simulations directly. Another rea-
son for that is the surrogacy issue [20].

These statements about the dimensions of the most in-
tense structures can be also formulated for log-binomial
distribution, and, it is known that the Poisson process
is a limit of the binomial distribution for “rare events”.
In particular, the Poisson distribution can be obtained
from the random β-model [17] by a suitable limiting
process [5], [21]. Let β take two values, W = β1 with
probability x, and W = β2 with probability 1 − x, and
β1x + β2(1 − x) = 1 (in order to have τ (1) = 0). Let also
β1 ≤ 1 ≤ β2. Then, on the n-th level, the distribution is
binomial, that is, Wn = εn = βm
with probability

In [5] and [21], Γ was treated as a free parameter. It was
shown that, if Γ = 1 − x/C, β1 = 1 − γ/C and x → 0,
then β2 ≈ 1 + xγ/C, and (8) reduces to (2).

In particular, if Γ = 1 − x/2 and x → 0, then Cβ = 2
[22].

If we do not treat Γ as a free parameter, and consider
that it is a ﬁxed number, then the log-binomial distri-
bution generally cannot be reduced to the log-Poisson
PDF: in particular, if x is small, then, τ (p) ∼ x → 0,
and thus the intermittency is negligible . As in our case
the division level n ≫ 1, the log-binomial distribution be-
comes essentially log-normal with maximum at m = xn
[11], [25]. However, the log-normal distribution has many
shortcomings, and it has been repeatedly criticized when
used to explain anomalous spectrum [26], [27]. Neverthe-
less, the spectrum (8) does not even look like log-normal
(for which τ (p) = −(µ/2)p(p − 1)) and rather behaves
like log-Poisson for p ≫ 1. Indeed, according to (8), for
p ≫ 1,

τ (p) = Cβ + C1βp − pγβ, C1 =

x
(1 − x) ln Γ

< 0, (11)

β = β1/β2. This spectrum resembles (2); and the con-
stants in (11) happen to be numerically close to corre-
sponding numbers in (2). The reason for such a dramatic
diﬀerence with log-normal distribution is as follows. For
binomial distribution,

δ = βp ≪ 1 for large p. Then δm decreases dramati-
cally with increasing m, and therefore the terms of the
sum (12) of maximal probability, at m ∼ xn, where nor-
mal distribution if formed, do not contribute substan-
tially. In contrast, only the ﬁrst few terms of this sum
(responsible for ”rare” and very intense events) really
contribute. Thus, eﬀectively, the distribution works like
a Poisson distribution. To see this explicitly, consider
a probability distribution (n
0 /A, where
A is a normalization constant, A = (xδ0 + 1 − x)n, and
δ0 = (β1/β2)p0 , p0 ≫ 1. Then, for large n we express
the factorials entering the binomial coeﬃcients through
Stirling formula (except for m!, because m is not neces-
sarily large), to get,

distribution eﬀectively corresponds to the Poisson distri-
bution.

Let us take the random β model “for real”, that is,
consider the Poisson distribution as an approximation to
the binomial, as in (13). Then, we may consider that the
model is realized as follows. Denote the number of divi-
sions of each volume by N . Then Γ = 1/N 1/D. We now
multiply the values of m divisions by β1 and multiply the
remaining N − m divisions by β2. This actually means
that the probability x = m/N , and 1 − x = (N − m)/N ).
A particular case of N = 2 and D = 1, i.e., x = 1/2, cor-
responds to the model proposed in [23]. Then, according
to (10), P = (r/ℓ)D, i.e., the Hausdorﬀ dimension H0
is = 0, while γβ, deﬁned from (9), = D ln β2/ ln 2. The
case β1 = 0 returns us to the β-model [24]. In that case,
β2 = 1/(1 − x), and γβ = Cβ = D ln (1 − x)/ ln (1/2).

intense structures geometry in fully developed turbu-
lence. The PDF’s of the exponents of the dissipation
ﬁeld are compared with the log-Poisson distribution to
show a good agreement with the theory. The log-Poisson
statistic can be considered as a limiting case for the log-
binomial distribution appearing in random β-model. We
estimated the parameters of the log-binomial distribution
with γ found in our measurements, and to ﬁt the expo-
nents for the structure functions found elsewhere. We
conclude that the estimated Hausdorﬀ co-dimension of
the most intense structures is less than 2.

from other theoretical models.

In general case, we may take D = 3, and we are deal-
ing with (8) with γβ given from our measurements (so
that β2 is deﬁned according to (9)). We thus are left
with two free parameters, N , an integer, and x = m/N ,
where m is also an integer. These numbers can be found
with help of computer search to ﬁt experimental data
[8], [9] in optimal way. As a result of this search, we
get: For γ = 0.57 (combined longitudinal and transver-
sal dissipation), N = 11, x = 7/11. With these pa-
rameters, the deviation of the spectrum from experimen-
tal is 0.0098, quite satisfactory. Indeed, the correspond-
ing τ (p/3) depicted in Fig. 3 is indistinguishable from
other approximations which collapse to the experimental
data. For γ = 0.61 (longitudinal dissipation), N = 4,
x = 2/4 = 1/2, Cβ = 1.5, the deviation is 0.0115, still
okay. As mentioned, at p ≫ 1, the log-binomial spec-
trum (8) is essentially reduced to the log-Poisson spec-
trum (2), and therefore we would prefer to consider the
log-binomial distribution to be more general.

In conclusion, one of the predictions of SL theory about
the scaling of maxima ∼ r−γ is experimentally conﬁrmed.
This makes it possible to make a better estimate of the

Abstract

Following the construction of a model for the planar supersymmet-
ric Chaplygin gas, supersymmetric ﬂuid mechanics in (1+1)-dimensions
is obtained from the light-cone parametrized Nambu-Goto superstring
in (2+1)-dimensions. The lineal model is completely integrable and
can be formulated neatly using Riemann coordinates. Inﬁnite towers
of conserved charges and supercharges are exhibited. They form ir-
reducible representations of a dynamical (hidden) SO(2, 1) symmetry
group.

1 Introduction

The Galileo invariant equations governing isentropic ﬂuids in one spatial
dimension (continuity and Euler equations for the density ρ and velocity v)
ρn) [1], and are
are completely integrable for polytropic gases (pressure
accompanied by the usual hallmarks of complete integrability: Lax pairs,
inﬁnite number of constants of motion, etc. [2] Especially interesting is the
Chaplygin gas (n =
1) because this model possesses the further hidden
symmetry of (2+1)-dimensional Poincar´e invariance, which is a consequence
of the fact that this ﬂuid model in (1+1)-dimensional spacetime devolves

−

∝

1

from the Nambu-Goto model for a string moving on the plane, after the
parameterization invariance of the latter is ﬁxed [3].

In this Letter we enlarge the lineal Chaplygin gas to include anti-commuting

Grassmann variables, so that the extended model supports a supersymme-
try. This is achieved by considering a superstring moving on a plane and
again ﬁxing the parameterization invariance. The construction is analogous
to what has already been done in one higher dimension: the Nambu-Goto
action for a supermembrane in (3+1)-dimensions gives rise, in a speciﬁc pa-
rameterization, to a supersymmetric planar Chaplygin gas [4]. Lineal and
planar supersymmetric ﬂuid models appear to be the only possible examples
of the supersymmetric Nambu-Goto/ﬂuid connection. For a higher dimen-
sional generalization, the reduction program would begin with a p-brane in
D = p + 2 spacetime, giving rise to a ﬂuid in D = p + 1 spacetime. While
there are no constraints on p in the purely bosonic case, supersymmetric
extensions are greatly constrained: the brane-scan for “fundamental” super
p-branes (i.e. with only scalar supermultiplets in the worldvolume) contains
only the above two cases cases [5], p = 2 in D = 4 and p = 1 in D = 3. As
we demonstrate, the supersymmetric extension enjoys the same integrability
properties as the purely bosonic, lineal Chaplygin gas, as a consequence of
the complete integrability for the dynamics of the superstring on the plane.

In these expressions µ, ν are spacetime indices running over 0, 1, 2 and i, j
are worldsheet indices denoting τ and σ. We now go to the light-cone gauge
where we deﬁne X ± = 1
X 2). X + is identiﬁed with the timelike
parameter τ , X − is renamed θ, and the remaining transverse component X 1

is renamed x. We can choose a two-dimensional Majorana representation for
the γ-matrices:

γ0 = σ2, γ2 =

iσ3, γ2 = iσ1,

−
such that ψ is a real, two-component spinor. A remaining fermionic gauge
choice sets

γ+ψ = 0,

±

√2(γ0

where γ± = 1
γ2). Thus ψ is further reduced to a real, one-component
Grassmann ﬁeld. Finally we deﬁne the complex conjugation of a product
of Grassmann ﬁelds (ψ1ψ2)⋆ = ψ⋆
2 so as to eliminate i from Grassmann
bilinears in our ﬁnal expression. The light-cone gauge-ﬁxed Lagrange density
becomes:

(2.12)
(2.13)

and the measure transforms with a factor of 1/√g. Finally, after renaming
√g as √2λ/ρ, we obtain the Lagrangian for the Chaplygin “super” gas in
(1+1)-dimensions (below and in what follows the overdot denotes derivative
with respect to time t):

We have used ρ and v in anticipation of their role as the ﬂuid density and ve-
locity, and we demonstrate below that they indeed satisfy appropriate equa-
tions of motion. For convenience we have also rescaled ψ everywhere by a
3/4. The Lagrangian (2.14) agrees with the limiting case of the
factor of 2−
planar ﬂuid in [4]. We note that as for the planar case, a more straightfor-
ward derivation leads to the ﬂuid Lagrangian of (2.14) with ρ integrated out.
Speciﬁcally, if the parameterization freedom is used directly to equate the
spacelike and timelike coordinates σ and τ with x and t, we obtain

shown below.

3.1 Equations of Motion

The following equations of motion are obtained by variation of the Lagrangian
(2.14):

Naturally, there are only three independent equations of motion as (3.4) is
obtained from (3.2), (3.3) and (2.15). Equations (3.1) and (3.4) are seen to
be just the continuity and Euler equations for the Chaplygin gas. Note that
these do not see the Grassmann variables directly.

We now pass to the Riemann coordinates, which for this system are (ve-

locity

The equations in (3.6) contain the continuity and Euler equations and are
known to be integrable [2]. It is readily veriﬁed that equation (3.7) for ψ is
solved by any function of R

,

and hence the ﬂuid model is completely integrable. That this is the case
should come as no surprise considering that we began with an integrable
world-sheet theory.

At this point it may seem curiously asymmetric that equation (3.7) for
the Grassmann ﬁeld should contain the R+ Riemann coordinate and not the
R
companion coordinate. In fact, the reverse would have been the case if
the sign of the √2λ term in (2.14) had been opposite. The entire model is
consistent with this substitution, which is just the choice of identifying √g
with plus or minus the sound speed √2λ/ρ.

We see that the supercharges evaluated on the solution (3.9) reproduce the
form of the bosonic charges (3.18).

Let us observe that there exist further bosonic and fermionic conserved

charges. For example, one may verify that the bosonic charges

3.2 Canonical Structure

The equations of motion (3.1-3.3) can also be obtained by Poisson brack-
eting with the Hamiltonian (3.10) if the following canonical brackets are
postulated:

where the last bracket, containing Grassmann arguments on both sides is
understood to be the anti-bracket. With these one veriﬁes that the con-
served charges in (3.14)-(3.17) generate the appropriate Galileo symmetry
transformations on the dynamical variables ρ, θ, and ψ. Correspondingly
the supercharges (3.22),(3.23) generate the super transformations

4 Further Symmetries of the Fluid Model

it should possess an enhanced symmetry beyond the Galileo symmetry in

G is sometimes referred to as the “anti-boost” because of its transforma-
tions on extended space-time [9]. The Galileo generators supplemented by
D and G together satisfy the Lie algebra of the (2+1)-dimensional Poincar´e
group, with N, P , and H corresponding to the three translations and with
B, D and G forming the (2+1)-dimensional Lorentz group SO(2, 1):

Finally we inquire about the algebra of the towers of extended charges

constants of motion like those in (3.25)-(3.27) and their generalizations with
more derivatives. Thus it appears that one is dealing with an open (super)
algebra.

5 Conclusions

We have presented an integrable, supersymmetric ﬂuid model with addi-
tional, “dynamical” symmetry tracing back to its origin in the superstring.
Besides the planar case in [4], this is the only other dimensionality for a su-
persymmetric Chaplygin gas that can be obtained by going to the light-cone
gauge in a super p-brane.

It remains an open question what other ﬂuid interactions can be obtained
from the rich factory of branes. For example, string theory D-branes have
gauge ﬁelds living on them. Such gauge ﬁelds would presumably remain in
passing to a ﬂuid model and may thus provide a model of magnetohydro-
dynamics from D-branes. It might also worthwhile to explore whether the
ﬂuid models with Grassmann variables are suited to describing the physical
properties of ﬂuids with spin degrees of freedom.

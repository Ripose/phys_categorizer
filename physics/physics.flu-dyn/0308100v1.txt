It was demonstrated by direct numerical simulation that, in the case of weakly nonlinear capillary waves,
one can get resonant waves interaction on the discrete grid when resonant conditions are never fulﬁlled exactly.
The waves’s decay pattern was obtained. The inﬂuence of the mismatch of resonant condition was studied as
well.

Nonlinear waves on the surface of a ﬂuid are one of
the most well known and complex phenomena in na-
ture. Mature ocean waves and ripples on the surface
of the tea in a pot, for example, can be described by
very similar equations. Both these phenomena are sub-
stantially nonlinear, but the wave amplitude is usually
signiﬁcantly less than the wavelength. Under this con-
dition, waves are weakly nonlinear.

To describe processes of this kind, the weak tur-
bulence theory was proposed [1],[2]. It results in Kol-
mogorov spectra as an exact solution of the Hasselman-
Zakharov kinetic equation [3]. Many experimental re-
sults are in great accordance with this theory. In the
case of gravity surface waves, the ﬁrst conﬁrmation was
obtained by Toba [4], and the most recent data by
Hwang [5] were obtained as a result of lidar scanning
of the ocean surface. Recent experiments with capillary
waves on the surface of liquid hydrogen [6],[7] are also
in good agreement with this theory. On the other hand,
some numerical calculations have been made to check
the validity of the weak turbulent theory [8],[9],[10].

In this Letter we study the one of the keystones of
the weak turbulent theory, the resonant interaction of
weakly nonlinear waves. The question under study is
the following:

•

How does a discrete grid for wavenumbers in nu-
merical simulations aﬀects the resonant interac-
tion?

•

Can a nonlinear frequency shift broad resonant
manifold to make discreteness unimportant?

We study this problem for nonlinear capillary waves
on the surface of an inﬁnite depth incompressible ideal
ﬂuid. Direct numerical simulation can make the situa-
tion clear.

Let us consider the irrotational ﬂow of an ideal in-
compressible ﬂuid of inﬁnite depth. For the sake of sim-
plicity, let us suppose ﬂuid density ρ = 1. The velocity
potential φ satisﬁes the Laplace equation

Each term in this equation has its own clear physical
meaning. The linear term gives a periodic evolution of
the initial wave. The ﬁrst nonlinear term describes a
merging of two waves k1 and k2 in k. The second de-
scribes a decay of the wave k0 to the waves k and k2.
And the last term corresponds to the second harmonic
generation process. It is useful to eliminate the linear
term with the substitution

ak = Akeiωkt.

Here, ˆk is the linear operator corresponding to multi-
plication of Fourier harmonics by the modulus of the

In the case of a continuous media, resonant condi-

tions (18) can be satisﬁed exactly. But on the grid, there
is always a frequency mismatch Ωk0
= 0 although if
the amplitude of the initial wave is high enough there
are resonances even on a discrete grid. But the width
of this resonance is very important.

System of equations (9) can be solved numerically.
This system is nonlocal in coordinate space due to the
presence of the ˆk-operator. The origin of this opera-
tor gives us a hint to solve (9) in wavenumbers space
(K-space). In this case we can eﬀectively use the fast
Fourier transform algorithm. Omitting the details of
this numerical scheme, we reproduce only the ﬁnal re-
sults of calculations.

We have solved system of equations (9) numerically
in the periodic domain 2π

As an initial conditions we used one monochromatic
wave of suﬃciently large amplitude with wave numbers
k0 (k0x = 0, k0y = 68). Along with that there was a
small random noise in all other harmonics.

In the beginning, one can observe exponential
growth of resonant harmonics in accordance with (21)
and (22). This is shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4. Here one
can clearly see that some harmonics are in resonance
and others are not.

harmonics that are the closest to the resonant manifold
(compare with Fig.2) reach the maximum level, while
the secondary decay process develops. Waves ampli-
tudes became signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The largest ampli-
tudes are for those waves with the maximal growth rate.
One can see the regular structure generated by the k0
wave in Fig.6. After a while the whole k-space is ﬁlled
by decaying waves, as shown in Fig.7.

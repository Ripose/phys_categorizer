On the absence of dissipative instability of negative energy waves in hydrodynamic
shear ﬂows.

Stability criterion for the surface gravity capillary waves in a ﬂowing two-layered ﬂuid system
with viscous dissipation is investigated. It is seen that the dissipative instability of negative energy
waves is absent,- contrary to what earlier authors have concluded. Their error is identiﬁed to arise
from an erroneous choice of the dissipation law, in which the wave proﬁle velocity is wrongly equated
to the particle velocity. Our corrected dissipation law is also shown to restore Galilean invariance
to the stability condition of the system.

Dissipative instability in a ﬂowing system has been discussed in the literature, and is being sought to be applied to
explain various phenomena for a few decades. This instability was shown by many authors to be caused by viscosity,
but seen only in some selected frames of reference in which a particular mode of the system possesses negetaive energy
[1–11]. Their result, therefore, implies that the stability of such a system is frame dependent, which obviously violates
the condition of Galilean invariance. In the present paper, it is shown that the violation of Galilean invariance arose
due to a wrong choice of the dissipation law. This question has also been recently addressed by us in an earlier
paper [12], where we calculated the total energy in a magnetohydrodynamic shear ﬂow. It is there shown that the
existing theories give a rate of entropy production which is not invariant under Galilean transformation. The method
to calculate the correct rate of energy dissipation is given by us in the earlier paper in considerable detail. In this
research note, we analyse the problem from the point of view of Euler’s equation of motion and show the validity of
our earlier conclusions.

The system considered is a single interface of discontinuity separating two uniform incompressible ﬂuid media. The
interface is along the x- direction with the force of gravity acting downwards, i.e., in the negative z- direction. The
equilibrium pressures, densities and velocities are given by

with the equlibrium pressure balance condition requiring that p1 = p2.

We consider small perturbations about the above equilibrium conﬁguration. The vertical displacement η(x, z, t) of

a streamline at any point (x, z) can then be written in a form

that is consistent with an incompressible and irrotational ﬂow. From the linearised equations of hydrodynamics, we
then obtain the expressions for the velocity and the pressure ﬂuctuations. These expressions are (with i =1,2)

p0(z), ρ0(z), u0(z) =

p1, ρ1, u1, z ≤ 0,
p2, ρ2, u2, z > 0,

dependence to be ˜η(k, t) ∼ exp (int), with a ‘dot’ designating a time derivative ∂/∂t.

temporal Fourier amplitudes (i.e., the normal modes) η(k, n) by substituing (3) in (4), we ﬁnd that for a non-trivial
solution to exist, one must have

Eqs.(5-7) constitute the familiar dispersion relation for the surface gravity capillary waves that exihibits the Rayleigh-
Taylor and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities under certain conditions [13].

It is necessary at this stage to introduce the question of dissipative instability. It was argued by several authors
[1–11] that, on introducing a kinematic viscosity ν in any one of the two media (in the lower medium, say), one
changes the dispersion relation to

which, for (∆n)2 > 0 and for a small kinematic viscosity

The above result contains two surprising conclusions. Firstly, the response of the system is not continuous with
respect to ν as ν −→ 0, i.e., the stability of the system for an arbitrarily small viscosity is diﬀerent from that when
viscosity is exactly zero. Furthermore, the stability with a small but nonzero ν appears to be dependent on U , where
U is of course dependent on the frame of reference. This means, that the stability of the system depends on the frame
of reference of the observer. In other words, by moving the observer with a given speed, one can create an instability
of the negative energy waves,- a result which obviously violates the fundamental law of Galilean invariance.

The problem can, however, be resolved in the following way. As has been done by most authors, we consider one
of the ﬂuids, i.e., the lower one to be viscous, while the upper one to be non-viscous. This simpliﬁcation enables us
to ignore the complications due to boundary layers, while the essential physics remains unaltered. We note, that by
substituting in ≡ ∂/∂t and ik ≡ ∂/∂x in the dispersion relation (5) for the non-viscous case, we obtain an equation
of motion

From Eq.(12), it is seen that, Eq.(11) describes the force equation of a ﬂuid system moving with a nett velocity U
with respect to the given frame of reference. Due cognizance should be taken about this fact while calculating the
viscous force term νρ1∂2/∂x2(δvz). It is to be noted that the term δvz here denotes the real velocity of the ﬂuid particles
pertaining to wave propagation [14], and not the proﬁle velocity ∂η(x, t)/∂t, as the earlier authors have suggested.
We note that, in this moving ﬂuid system, the particle velocity is calculated as δvz = Dη(x, t)/Dt = i(n + kU )η(x, t).

The above argument implies that, the equation of motion in the presence of viscosity must read

In Eq.(15), the last term on the right hand side predicts a damping for both the wavemodes when (∆n)2 > ν2α2

A growth is, however, possible if and only if

thus presenting the same instability criterion (∆n)2 < 0, as in equation (10) for the non-viscous case. While precluding
the dissipative instability of negative energy waves, Eqs.(15) and (16) thus suggest that the presence of viscous
dissipation does not at all alter the stability property of the surface gravity capillary waves.

The foregoing analysis shows that, the dissipative instability is simply an artifact of an erroneous choice of the
viscous damping law by the earlier authors. The correct viscosity law, written as in the last term of Eq.(13),
corresponds to a resistance proportional to νρ1∂2(δvz)/∂x2 = −iνρ1k2
η(x, t). Replacing this expression
by −iνρ1nk2η(x, t) , as was done by the earlier authors, would be equivalent to having a resistance of the form
. For small values of the kinematic viscosity ν, we can then
α
n + kU
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
use Eq.(5) to write α(n+, U) ≈
/∆n for the (+) and the (-) modes,
/∆n and α(n−, U) ≈
respectively. Here, α(n+, U ) is always positive, but α(n−, U) is negative when U > (∆n)/k. In such a situation, the
force α(n−, U )νρ1∂2(δvz)/∂x2 would act as an attractive force, that helps to build up the amplitude of the negative
energy wave. The erroneous resistance formula, that has been used so far in the literature, thus makes the viscous
drag force frame dependent and gives a velocity dependent acceleration in selected frames, rather than a deceleration
in all frames. By substituting unity for α(n, U ), the correct viscous resistance formula however demands that, the
velocity δvz be the true velocity of the ﬂuid particles pertaing to wave motion so that, the viscous force becomes frame
independent. The use of this correct formula leads us to two important results. Firstly, it precludes the possibility
of dissipative instability in negative energy wave systems. Secondly, it gives a dispersion relation in which the drift
velocity U appears only as a Doppler shift term in the frequency;- the important consequence of which is that, the
stability of the system is independent of U, thus giving the required frame independent universal character to the
stability condition of the system.

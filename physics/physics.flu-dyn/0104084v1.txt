We study the 3D topology of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) single-modes,
which includes bubbles, jets and saddle points. We present an analytic description of the interface
as a whole, for arbitrary time-dependant acceleration g(t). The dependance of morphology on the
lattice - Hexagonal, square or triangular -of bubbles are investigated. RM accelerations in the case
of a large density ratio produce jets well separated from each other while, in RT case, jets are
connected by liquid sheets. We compare our analytic results to numerical simulations.

The RT and RM instabilities (RTI and RMI) play an
important role in astrophysics [1–3], in ion [4] and laser
[5] inertial conﬁnement fusion (ICF), in shock-tube mix-
ing [6,7] and in chemical, nuclear or thermonuclear com-
bustion [8]. The asymmetry caused by RTI and RMI
in spherical implosions strongly alters the neutron yield
and energy gain in ICF targets [4,5]. Recently, it was
proposed to use experiments on very powerful existing
and future laser systems such as Omega and the National
Ignition Facility in the USA or the Laser M´egaJoule in
France for modeling the unstable explosion of supernovae
(SN) [1,2] or unstable expansion of SN-remnants [1,2].
Flow with two shocks and mixing between them (similar
to SN-ﬂow) takes place during an expansion of detona-
tion products after an explosion [3,9] (compare with [10]).
RTI/RMI are also signiﬁcant for other astrophysical ap-
plications such as planetary nebulaes, Wolf-Rayet stars
and magnetospheres of neutron stars [3]. The physical
origins of exchange instabilities (RTI and RMI) are con-
nected with baroclinic generation of vorticity [3,11]. RTI
is driven by buoyancy (see reviews [3,12]). RMI occurs
after the passage of a shock wave through surface corru-
gations [3,6,7,11].

Conﬁgurations of 3D single-mode perturbations can be
represented by bubble lattices having various geometrical
symmetries: hexagonal (B6), square (B4) or triangular
(B3). The B stands for “bubble” and the digits 6, 4 and
3 correspond to the number of bubbles adjacent to the
chosen one. Saddles and jets also form lattices. In the
lattice B6 a jet J has three neighbouring jets. Therefore
the lattice B6 is the same time as the lattice J3.

Our goal is to describe 3D phenomena and their de-
pendence on both lattice symmetry and acceleration pro-
ﬁle, g(t). This approach is needed to understand phe-
nomena occuring in ICF, astrophysics, etc., because real
unstable ﬂows are three-dimensional and the accelera-
tion, g(t), satisﬁes neither the RTI nor the RMI condi-
tions [13]. To begin our study, let us compare the ex-
amples in Fig.1 (2D) and Fig.2 (3D). They represent,
at time1 t = 1 , the position of the periodically per-
turbed interface η in the RM case. At t = 0, the
interface η(x, 0)
η00) corre-

sponds to the plane z = 0 and the potential of the ve-
cos xe−z [resp.
locity perturbation is ϕ(x, z, t = 0)
(cos x + cos y)e−z] in 2D (resp. 3D/B4).
ϕ(x, y, z, 0)
These initial conditions are called “standard” because
they are widely used for small initial perturbations. The
heavy ﬂuid, with density ρ, is above (z > η) the light ﬂuid
with density ρl. Jets of dense ﬂuid move down while light
bubbles rise up. Analytically we consider the case with
0. Our method of calculation is
density ratio µ = ρl/ρ

presented below.

In the 2D case (Fig. 1) [resp. 3D case (Fig. 2)],
the points B and J (resp. B, S and J) are very impor-
tant since they correspond to stagnation points. At these
points, the velocity of the ﬂuid becomes zero relative to
the surface η.

FIG. 2. Geometry of a single 3D mode in a square lat-
tice (B4). Periodic cell structure in the horizontal plane or

The 3D/B4 ﬂow is invariant relative to 900-rotations
around B and J vertical axis and to 1800-rotations around
S axis (Fig. 2).

≪

For small density ratios, µ

1, the whole ﬂow is
clearly divided into two qualitatively very diﬀerent parts.
The ﬁrst is the bubble envelope imprinting into the dense
ﬂuid. Bubbles brake the initially continuous dense ﬂuid
and produce jets. Above the envelope, the dense ﬂuid is
still in a contiguous state. The second part is the ejecta
(jets) pinched and driven down by the imprinting bub-
bles. The points B belong to the contiguous ﬂuid and
the points S and J to the ejecta. The 3D pattern of the
ejecta is rather complicated (Fig. 3). The ejecta consists
of 1) wall type jets going down from B to S and 2) leg
type jets going from S to J. The bubble has the shape of
a well in the dense ﬂuid. This well transforms into walls
or skirts around the points B.

The relevant topological measure of the form of the

ejecta is the geometrical ratio

Γ(t) = ∆zBS/∆zBJ, with ∆zMN = zM (t)

zN (t), (1)

−

where zB, zS and zJ are the vertical positions of the
points (Fig. 3). Γ is the ratio of the length of “skirt”
to the length of “legs”.

FIG. 3. Numerical results for RM (the triad in the upper
panel, t = 20) and RT (lower panel, t = 9) cases for the
lattices B6, B4 and B3 from left to right. The ratio is µ = 0.1.

The six direct numerical simulations (DNS) in Fig. 3
were done by a grid-characteristics method [14]. Several
interesting works are devoted to DNS of 3D RTI/RMI
ﬂows [15].

Before presenting our results, let us give the bound-
ary conditions and spectral decomposition. The motion
is described by a velocity harmonic potential ϕ (the vor-
ticity is concentrated at the interface). Classical [3,12]

close connection to the method of ordinary collocations
in which boundary conditions are approximated in a set
of discrete points

This is the ﬁrst time we use MAC to describe the

respectively. Similarly to (7-9), the 2D solution has been
obtained previously [3,16,19,21]. The integrals (7-9) give
η0(t), K(t), w(t) in analytic form for all times from initial
to asymptotic state. They are valid in the RM case for
B and J points of B6,4 and 3 lattices.

It is very suprising that the relation K(η0) (6) between
the main geometrical characteristics η0 and K for a bub-
ble penetrating into the dense ﬂuid does not depend upon

g(t) for N = 1. This means that the relation is only
weakly dependent on g(t) in the general case with arbi-
trary N.

g(t) inﬂuences therefore the evolution of this ratio. The
morphology of the ejecta mainly depends on the type of
lattice. The shortest skirts are obtained for the B3 lat-
tice (lower set of curves) which produces powerful and
fast jets (Fig. 3). Previously, it has been shown [16] that
for random (turbulent) cases, the patterns are similar to
the B6 and B4 lattices (B3 lattices occur only for special
conditions). Moreover, B3 type structures may appear
after reshock and the corresponding rephasing because
B6 bubbles transform into B3 jets.

In summary, we have considered the eﬀects of lattice
and time-dependant acceleration on the evolution of the
interface. We found that the shape of imprinting bub-
bles is very weakly dependent on these factors, but the
position of the bubbles depends on the history of the ac-
celeration. At the same time, the shape and dynamics of
the ejecta appear very sensitive to both factors.

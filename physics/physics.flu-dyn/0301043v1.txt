We investigate experimentally the inﬂuence of suspended particles on the transition to turbulence.
The particles are monodisperse and neutrally-buoyant with the liquid. The role of the particles on
the transition depends both upon the pipe to particle diameter ratios and the concentration. For
large pipe-to-particle diameter ratios the transition is delayed while it is lowered for small ratios. A
scaling is proposed to collapse the departure from the critical Reynolds number for pure ﬂuid as a
function of concentration into a single master curve.

More than a century after Reynolds’ work [1], un-
derstanding how turbulent regions grow in a pipe and
bring the laminar Poiseuille ﬂow to fully developed tur-
bulence is still not completely achieved. Above a crit-
ical Reynolds number, the laminar ﬂow is observed to
be unstable, turbulent regions grow and are convected in
the pipe. This ﬂow regime is called intermittent. When
the ﬂow rate is further increased, the ﬂow becomes fully
turbulent [2]. In fact, the transition happens to be sub-
critical and the ﬂow is linearly stable for all ﬂow rates
[3]. A ﬁnite amplitude perturbation is needed to trigger
the transition and the critical Reynolds depends upon
its amplitude. For small perturbations, laminar motion
is observed as far as Re ≈ 105 but the transition in pure
ﬂuid can be reached for Re ≈ 2100 provided that the
perturbation is strong enough to allow the growth of tur-
bulent “puﬀs” [2]. Recent studies have investigated with
diﬀerent kinds of perturbations the nature of the unstable
modes, either in the inlet region or in the fully developed
ﬂow [4, 5].

The objective of the present work is to examine how
transition to turbulence is aﬀected by the presence of sus-
pended particles in the simplest case of neutral buoyancy.
More speciﬁcally, we focus upon determining the transi-
tion threshold between the laminar and the intermittent
regime as a function of the particle volume fraction φ of
the suspension. Because the particles are neutrally buoy-
ant and largely drag-free, the present study is related to
recent work which has examined global subcritical stabil-
ity behavior of plane Couette ﬂow forced by the presence
of a single spherical bead or a spanwise wire [6, 7]. This
work also has a practical aspect as it is related to pipeline
ﬂow of slurries.

µ = 1.64 ± 0.03 cP.

The experimental set-up consists of a straight and hor-
izontal cylindrical glass tube of 2.6 m length mounted on
a rigid support structure. Two diﬀerent tubes having dif-
ferent inner diameters D1 = 8 mm and D2 = 14 mm are
used in the experiments. These tubes are longer than the
entry lengths necessary for the laminar ﬂow to fully de-
velop at Re ≈ 2000, Le(D1) ∼ 0.6 m and Le(D2) ∼ 1 m.
The pipe to particle diameter ratios, D/d, used in the ex-
periments by combining the diﬀerent particles and tubes
are indicated in table I. In order to ensure that the ﬂow in
the pipe is undisturbed by perturbations from a pump,
the ﬂow is driven by gravity. The suspension is deliv-
ered to the tube by overﬂow from a tank positioned at
a ﬁxed height to an outlet of variable height, passing
through the glass tube. A Moineau progressing cavity
pump (PCM model MR2.6H24) carries the suspension
back to the overﬂowing tank, but is isolated from the
ﬂow through the glass tube.

With these ﬂow conditions, the transition for pure ﬂuid
was found to take place at Re ≈ 2300, but the ﬂow was
very sensitive to any kind of perturbation applied to the
pipe.
In order to control the transition with a known
perturbation, a ring (solid annulus) ﬁtting tightly into
the tube and of thickness 1.5 mm was inserted in the
pipe at its entrance. The perturbation produced by the
ring then controlled the transition and lowered it down
to Re ≈ 2100, which is the lowest value that could be
reached with this kind of perturbation. The inﬂuence of
the particles on the transition has been studied with this
ring.

or turbulent, are identiﬁed by visualization as well as by
measuring the pressure drop between the entrance and
the exit of the glass tube.

A classical way to detect the pipe-ﬂow transition for
pure ﬂuid is to inject dye and to observe the wavering of
the streak as it passes down the pipe [1, 2]. In the present
experiment with particles, direct visualization of the par-
ticle motion in the suspension is a very straightforward
way of observing the birth and convection of “turbulent
puﬀs” in the ﬂow. Whereas motion in the laminar regime
is characterized by parallel particle trajectories, motion
in a turbulent puﬀ presents a strong mixing in the radial
direction. When the ﬂow rate is increased, we observe
more and more turbulent puﬀs in the ﬂow, and ﬁnally
these merge once the turbulent regime is established.

To provide a more quantitative indicator of transition,
we also measured the pressure drop between the entrance
and the exit of the glass tube with electronic manome-
ters (Newport Omega PX 154). Pressure ﬂuctuations
due to the larger pressure drop caused by the turbulent
puﬀs could then be clearly identiﬁed with a signal ana-
lyzer (Hewlett Packard 3562A). Figure 1 shows pressure
drop spectra in the low-frequency range for the laminar
ﬂow and at the onset of intermittency, both for a particle
volume fraction φ = 0.1. The spectrum in the intermit-
tent regime displays strong ﬂuctuations for frequencies
under 0.1 Hz. Using the spectral signature, the onset
of intermittency can thus be clearly identiﬁed even for
large volume fractions where the visualization is not pos-
sible. The spectrum of pressure ﬂuctuations in the ﬂow
driven by the pump was observed to consist of “contin-
uous noise” of the type shown by ﬁgure 1, plus a strong
peak at the frequency of the pump rotation with its as-
sociated harmonics. By contrast, the ﬂuctuations when
the ﬂow is driven by gravity are observed to have only
the “continuous noise”. Furthermore, this noise was de-
termined to be unchanged when the pump was oﬀ and
the overﬂow tank was ﬁlled manually. Consequently, the
spectrum observed in the gravity-driven ﬂow is consid-
ered to be independent of the pump.

When the threshold of intermittency was reached, we
measured the critical ﬂow rate Qc and deduced the crit-
ical Reynolds number Rec = 4Qcρ/πµD with the pipe
diameter D as the length scale. To measure Q, we col-
lected a given volume of the suspension without altering
the ﬂow, by capturing ﬂuid at the outlet to the thermo-
statically controlled reservoir. The time needed to ob-
tain this volume yielded Qc. The particles collected in
this volume were then sieved, rinsed, dried, and weighed
to provide the mean particle volume fraction φ in the
suspension ﬂow. Measurements of the critical Reynolds
number associated with the start of intermittency have
been carried out for diﬀerent combinations of particles
and tubes presented in table I and for diﬀerent concen-
trations φ ranging from 0 to 0.3.

Figure 2 displays the critical Reynolds number Rec as a
function of the particle volume fraction φ for the diﬀerent
combinations of particles and tubes. The results indicate

two diﬀerent situations:

sition is shifted to larger Reynolds numbers. The
critical Reynolds number Rec is a monotonically
increasing function of φ. Furthermore, the data for
the two sizes collapse onto a single curve, so that
at a given φ in that range of D/d, the transition

threshold does not depend on the diameters of the
particles and of the tube.

(ii) For particles with D/d ≤ 65, the behavior depends
on φ. For small φ, the transition is moved to lower
Reynolds number and Rec decreases with increas-
ing φ. The magnitude of the decrease and in par-
ticular the minimum Rec reached as φ is increased
depends on the diameters of the particles and the
tube.
In particular, for the 780 µm particles in
pipe D1 for which D/d ∼ 10 ((cid:3)), intermittency
is observed at Rec ∼ 1000 for φ ∼ 0.07. This is
the smallest Rec found in this work. For larger φ,
Rec increases with increasing φ and the transition
is eventually delayed. It is worth noticing that the
data for combinations of particles and tube hav-
ing roughly the same D/d collapse onto the same
curve (◦ and H for D/d ∼ 27 − 37 and ▽ and (cid:4) for
D/d ∼ 16 − 18).

The behavior for D/d ≥ 65 seems simpler since it is
independent of the diameters of the particles and of the
tube. The observed delay to the transition is expected
to be due to an enhancement of the viscosity caused by
the suspended particles. Common models for the eﬀec-
tive viscosity µe of a suspension do not depend on the
size of the particles and give an increase of the viscosity
with increasing average concentration φ. A well-known
example is Krieger’s viscosity [8, 9], which expresses the
eﬀective viscosity µe as a function of φ according to the
law:

µe
µ

= (1 − φ/φm)

−1.82

(1)

where µ is the viscosity of the pure ﬂuid and φm = 0.68
the random close packing (i.e. maximum) concentration
for spherical particles. This empirical formula initially
determined at low Reynolds number is commonly used
at ﬁnite Reynolds.

The critical Reynolds number of the suspension using
equation (1), Recs = Recµ/µe, is plotted as a function
of φ in ﬁgure 3. We observe that for D/d ≥ 65 (× and
•) Recs is approximately independent of φ and remains
close to the value for the pure ﬂuid, Recs ≈ 2100. For
φ ≥ 0.25, we observe a steep increase in this thresh-
old (• and also H), suggesting the presence of an ad-
ditional mechanism for dissipation beyond the viscosity
enhancement observed in Stokes ﬂow suspensions. How-
ever, we have only a limited range of concentration data,
because the large ﬂow rates required to achieve transi-
tion at the elevated eﬀective viscosity result in a large
pressure drop. The large pressure exceeds the range of
the pressure gauges and also necessitates the direct use
of the pump instead of gravity-driven ﬂow that we have
chosen to consider only in this study.

This simple scaling with Krieger’s viscosity is not suf-
ﬁcient to obtain a collapse of the curves for D/d ≤ 65
(see ﬁgure 3 for ◦, ▽, (cid:3), H, (cid:4)). However, we can no-
tice a similarity between these curves. At low φ, there

is a ﬁrst regime where Recs decreases steeply with in-
creasing φ and the diﬀerent curves appear to collapse. It
should be mentioned that a very small decrease is also ob-
served for the 215 µm particles in pipe D2 (•) but it can
be considered to be within error bars. Above a critical
volume fraction φc which depends on the pipe to parti-
cle diameter ratio D/d, there is a second regime where

f
the curves eventually reach minimum values of Recs and
remain approximately independent of φ for larger vol-
ume fractions. These minimum values of Recs decrease
with increasing D/d. Moreover, the data for combina-
tions of particles and tube having similar values of D/d
seem to collapse onto the same curve. These last obser-
vations lead us to scale the diﬀerence between the critical
Reynolds number of the suspension Recs and that of the
pure ﬂuid Rec0 = 2100 as well as φ with D/d as dis-
played in ﬁgure 4. This new scaling provides a collapse
of the diﬀerent curves for all D/d. The scaled diﬀerence
(Recs −Rec0)D/d initially decreases rapidly and approxi-
mately linearly with φD/d, then saturates and eventually
increases slightly at larger φD/d. The results on ﬁgure 4
suggest φc ∼ d/D.

These data were obtained with the ring at the entrance
of the pipe but similar results were also observed without
it. This suggests that the subcritical transition is trig-
gered by the particles. A particle introduces ﬂuctuational
velocities whose form and coupling to the mean ﬂow vary
with the particle Reynolds number Rep = Re d2/D2. Un-
like the case of uniform ﬂow, the inﬂuence of Rep on the
structure of the dual wakes caused by shear ﬂow around
suspended bodies is, while under study [6, 14], not well
understood. It is plausible that the inﬂuence of particle
size in reducing Recs at a ﬁxed φ results from the increase
in the particle scale Reynolds number with d/D. With
increasing Rep, the disturbance ﬂow caused by the par-
ticle is presumably less eﬃciently dissipated by viscous
action, thus allowing for stronger coupling to the bulk
ﬂow.

A more reﬁned analysis should take into account the in-
ﬂuence of particles on the velocity and concentration pro-
ﬁle in the pipe ﬂow. In conditions of very low Reynolds
number and high concentration, particles migrate to-
wards the center of the pipe and blunt the velocity pro-
ﬁle, see for instance [10]. This eﬀect which would tend
to reduce the eﬀective viscosity in the pipe is suspected
to be present for the 780 µm particles in pipe D1 for
φ ≥ 0.25 (see (cid:3) in ﬁgure 3). There exists a second type
of migration, the so-called “tubular pinch eﬀect”, which
is inertial and causes a single particle to move to a po-

4

sition at a distance of 0.3D from the axis [12, 13]. This
eﬀect is observed with the larger particles in both pipes.
The present study seems to suggest that the particles
alter the threshold of the subcritical transition through
coupling of the base ﬂow to velocity ﬂuctuations rather
than the base ﬂow itself through their migration but this
requires conﬁrmation.

This work leads to deﬁnite conclusions regarding the
inﬂuence of suspended neutrally-buoyant solids upon the
transition away from laminar ﬂow. The inﬂuence de-
pends both upon the pipe to particle diameter ratios and
concentration. For D/d ≥ 65, neutrally-buoyant parti-
cles cause a delay in transition to larger Rec. This eﬀect
can be explained by the enhancement of the eﬀective vis-
cosity of the suspension. However, for φ > 0.25, the delay
in transition is found to be substantially larger than can
be explained by a simple renormalization by eﬀective vis-
cosities. For D/d ≤ 65, the behavior is quite diﬀerent and
neutrally-buoyant particles alter the transition to turbu-
lence in pipe ﬂow to smaller Rec. Scaling the departure
from the critical Reynolds number for pure ﬂuid as well
as the concentration with D/d gives a master curve for
the transition for all D/d. The most plausible explana-
tion for the reduction of the critical Reynolds number,
though one still in need of conﬁrmation, is that the ﬂuc-
tuations induced by the particles trigger the subcritical
transition.

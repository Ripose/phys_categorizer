We consider the bifurcation scenario that is found in Rayleigh–B´enard convection of binary ﬂuid mixtures
like ethanol–water at positive separation ratios and small Lewis numbers leading to a bifurcation sequence
of square, oscillatory crossroll, stationary crossroll, and roll patterns. We propose a system of four coupled
amplitudes that is capable to model all important properties.

Key words: Rayleigh–B´enard convection, Soret eﬀect, pattern selection, amplitude equations

Introduction

The Rayleigh–B´enard system [1, 2] is one of the
most popular model systems to study spontaneous
structure formation emerging via instabilities. The
system consists of a ﬂuid layer conﬁned between
two parallel plates perpendicular to the direction of
gravity, and exposed to a vertical temperature gra-
dient that is established by keeping the upper and
lower plate at two diﬀerent temperatures T0 −∆T /2
and T0 + ∆T /2 respectively.

Rayleigh–B´enard convection in one–component
ﬂuids at small and moderate temperature diﬀer-
ences is well understood, mainly thanks to the
work of Busse and co–workers in the 70s and 80s
[3, 4, 5, 6]. The bifurcation behavior becomes more
complex in binary mixtures. Here, the concentra-
tion enters as an additional relevant dynamic ﬁeld.
Concentration diﬀerences are created in the pres-
ence of a non–vanishing Soret eﬀect, a nonequilib-
rium eﬀect that describes the driving of concentra-
tion currents by temperature diﬀerences.

The concentration couples back into the system’s
dynamics via variations that determine the buoy-
ancy force density. When the lighter component of
the mixture is driven into the direction of higher
temperature, thereby enhancing the density gradi-
ent and further destabilizing the layer one speaks of

a positive Soret eﬀect, and of a negative Soret eﬀect
in the opposite case.

Convection in binary mixtures shows a very rich
bifurcation behavior. For negative separation ra-
tios convection rolls bifurcate backwards and time–
dependent patterns, namely traveling waves and
standing waves appear. The bistability of convec-
tive patterns and the ground state leads to the ex-
istence of localized structures and fronts.

In the case of positive separation ratios on which
we will focus in this paper the two–dimensional roll
structures are often replaced by squares at onset,
but become the preferred pattern at higher temper-
ature diﬀerences. For intermediate ∆T two types of
crossroll structures can exist, a stationary and an
oscillatory type that transfer stability from squares
to rolls.

There are few–mode models that satisfactorily
explain the bifurcation properties for negative Soret
eﬀects [7]. However, for positive Soret eﬀects a
model with only a few degrees of freedom, that is
able to properly describe rolls, squares and cross-
rolls seems to be lacking.

In this paper we will present a system of four
equations that describe all important properties of
the square – crossroll – roll transition for the case
of a positive Soret eﬀect.

The paper is organized as follows: after this in-

troduction we discuss in Sec. 2 the Rayleigh–B´enard
system and the bifurcation scenario for positive
Soret eﬀects in more detail. In Sec. 3, the main part,
we present and discuss a model system that shows
a similar behavior but incorporates an additional,
artiﬁcial symmetry that makes it easier to identify
the stationary solutions but leads to some qualita-
tive disagreements with the full system. In Sec. 4
we add some terms that break this symmetry and
demonstrate that then these diﬀerences disappear.
We summarize our ﬁndings in Sec. 5 and provide an
outlook.

2 Bifurcation scenario

The basic equations that couple convection velocity
u, temperature θ, concentration c and pressure P
read in a dimensionless form [8]

(∂t + u · ∇) u = −∇P + σ h(θ + c) ez + ∇
(∂t + u · ∇) θ = Ruz + ∇
(∂t + u · ∇) c = Rψuz + L (cid:16)∇
∇ · u = 0 .

The ﬁelds are given as deviations from the qui-
escent conductive ground state. The direction of
gravity is the negative z direction. See ref.
[8]
for details. There appear four diﬀerent parameters
in these equations: the Rayleigh number R is the
control parameter, the dimensionless temperature
diﬀerence between upper and lower plate. In pure
ﬂuids, the critical Rayleigh number of the onset of
convection is Rc(ψ = 0) = 1707.76. One deﬁnes a
reduced Rayleigh number r = R/Rc(ψ = 0). The
Prandtl number σ is the ratio of the timescales of
heat and momentum diﬀusion. The Lewis number
L on the other hand is the ratio of the heat and
concentration timescales. The separation ratio ψ ﬁ-
nally measures the strength of the Soret eﬀect. In
the conductive ground state it determines the ratio
of the density gradients due to concentration and
temperature.

In typical liquids it is σ ≈ 10. Concentration
diﬀusion is slow in ordinary liquid mixtures; a typ-
ical value for L, say, for ethanol–water is 0.01. ψ

varies with the mean concentration and mean tem-
perature and can be both positive and negative in
ethanol–water.

For positive ψ three diﬀerent bifurcation scenar-
ios exist at small and moderate r. (i) For very small
ψ and relatively large L the Soret generated con-
centration variations are small and easily diﬀused
away. The mixture then still behaves qualitatively
like a pure ﬂuid. The ﬁrst convection structure to
be observed above onset takes the form of parallel,
stationary rolls with alternating direction of rota-
tion. Near onset, uz, θ, and c can be described by a
function A cos(kx)f (z) with k being the wavenum-
ber of the rolls and f (z) being diﬀerent for the three
ﬁelds and deﬁning the critical vertical proﬁle.

(ii) When ψ is larger and/or L is smaller the mix-
ture begins to behave qualitatively diﬀerent. The
rolls are replaced by a square pattern near on-
set that can be written as a linear combination
of equally strong rolls in x– and y–direction, i. e.,
[A cos(kx) + B cos(ky)] f (z) with A = B. At higher
r however the advective mixing is strong enough to
equilibrate the concentration ﬁeld outside of some
small boundary layers at the plates and between the
rolls. The mixture again behaves like a pure ﬂuid
and squares lose their stability to rolls. The stabil-
ity is transferred via a crossroll branch, a structure
that, like squares, can be understood as a superposi-
tion of two perpendicular sets of convection rolls. In
the case of crossrolls, however, the two amplitudes
A and B are not equal and the crossroll structure
therefore lacks the square x ↔ y symmetry. Like
squares and rolls, these structures are stationary.

(iii) At even smaller L, but easily realizable with
liquid mixtures the scenario is again diﬀerent as
shown in Fig. 1. There the squared amplitude of
the leading velocity mode of the x–roll set is plot-
ted versus the reduced Rayleigh number r. Solid
(open) symbols denote stable (unstable) structures.
Squares (square symbols) are again stable at small
r but lose their stability against another type of
crossrolls, an oscillatory one (lines without sym-
bols). The bifurcation point where the stationary
crossrolls (triangles) emerge still exists but at higher
r, where the oscillatory instability has already taken
place. In the oscillatory crossroll branch the ampli-

ﬁeld equations for σ = 27, L = 0.0045, ψ = 0.23. The
wave number of the structures is k = π.

FIG. 2. Oscillatory crossrolls, squared amplitude of the
x– and y–roll component for the parameters of Fig. 1
and r = 1.08 (top), r = 1.13 (bottom).

tude of the x– and y–roll set varies periodically in
counterphase to each other such that when at one
time the x–rolls are stronger, half a period later the
y–rolls will be the stronger set. The two branches
in Fig. 1 show the maximal and minimal ampli-
tudes of these time dependent structures. The two
stationary crossroll branches represent the two dif-
ferent types: In the upper branch the x–roll com-
ponent is the dominant one and their amplitude
grows whereas the amplitude of the y–roll compo-
nent gets smaller. When the latter component van-
ishes the crossroll ends at a bifurcation point on the
x–roll branch (circles). The lower branch belongs
to the type of crossrolls where the y–roll compo-
nent is the dominant one. Now the plotted x–roll
component gets smaller until the structure ends on
the y–roll branch, i. e., on the axis in Fig. 1 since
there only the strength of the x–rolls is plotted. The
stationary crossrolls gain stability when the oscilla-
tory crossrolls vanish and transfer the stability to
the rolls. The existence of all these structures have
been demonstrated in experiments [9, 10, 11].

main characteristics of these structures near the be-
ginning and the end of their r–range of existence.
While the oscillation is very harmonic at smaller r
it becomes very anharmonic at higher r. The fre-
quency decreases. Finally, the oscillatory crossrolls

end in an entrainment process in a very narrow r–
interval [12].

The crossroll structures exist around r = 1, i. e.
the critical Rayleigh number of the pure ﬂuid. In the
same region the branches of rolls and squares bend
upwards. Before and after this transition interval
the curves are almost linear but with very diﬀer-
ent slopes. These two regimes at small and large r
are called the Soret and the Rayleigh regime respec-
tively. In the Soret region the convection can be well
explained by an amplitude equation model includ-
ing only cubic terms. In the Rayleigh region on the
other hand the concentration ﬁeld has been equi-
librated and the convection amplitudes agree well
with those of the pure ﬂuid. In the Rayleigh region
slightly above r = 1 the pure ﬂuid still obeys its
own amplitude equation and so does therefore in-
directly also the mixture [13]. We will make use of
the fact that the bifurcation behavior of the mixture
can in fact be described by two diﬀerent amplitude
equations in two diﬀerent r–intervals in the next
section.

3 The simpliﬁed model

In this section we want to present a ﬁrst attempt to
explain the bifurcation scenario as described above
by means of a simple model. The full picture cannot

be captured by simple amplitude equations derived
in an expansion around the onset in combination
with a multi–scale analysis from the basic equations.
Although a sequence of stable squares, forward bi-
furcating stable (stationary) crossrolls, and ﬁnally
stable rolls may be described with a system of two
coupled quintic amplitude equations [14], the oscil-
latory crossrolls are not contained in such a model.
When A is the real amplitude of x–rolls, referring to
a critical mode A cos(kx)f (z), and B is the corre-
sponding mode in y–direction then a system of two
coupled amplitude equations must read for reasons
of symmetry

with some arbitrary function F . F is real since the
critical perturbations lead to stationary patterns.
For squares, it is A = B and the Jacobian of the
right hand sides of the above equations will be sym-
metric. Therefore, complex eigenvalues that would
mark the appearance of oscillatory crossrolls are not
possible along this branch.

In order to reﬂect the existence of the Soret and
Rayleigh regime we construct a model of two cou-
pled sets of amplitude equations. We deﬁne two
diﬀerent amplitudes A1 and A2, both describing
rolls in x–direction of diﬀerent nature: solutal rolls
that exist in the Soret region due to the desta-
bilizing eﬀect of the initial concentration gradient
and which are described by a mode A1 cos(kx)f (z)
and the thermal rolls A2 cos(kx)g(z) that exist in
the Rayleigh regime environment of almost homo-
geneous concentration and which are driven by the
thermal stress alone. B1 and B2 are the correspond-
ing amplitudes for the rolls in y–direction.

The most simple model would consist of two sets
of equations as in (2), including only cubic terms
to couple the A– and B–rolls and additional cubic
terms to couple the index 1 and index 2 structures:

These equations do not deﬁne an amplitude equa-
tion model in a strict sense since they are not meant
to result from a controlled expansion of the dynam-
ics near the bifurcation threshold of the full system.
Instead, in order to describe the actual convection
behavior we have two bifurcation points here, as it
is displayed by the two diﬀerent control parame-
ters µ1 and µ2. These parameters are not indepen-
dent however. Since the only control parameter in
the Rayleigh–B´enard system is r, the parameters µi
must be functions of each other. We set

µ1 = µ ,

µ2 = aµ − µ0 .

(4)

The two bifurcation points are at µ1 = 0 and at
µ2 = 0. Since for L ≪ 1 solutal rolls grow on a
much slower timescale than thermal rolls one has to
have a ≫ 1. When µ = −1 refers to r = 0 it has
to be µ2 = 0 at µ ≫ 1 since the onset of convection
in mixtures lies at much smaller r than the onset
r = 1 in a pure ﬂuid. For the plots we set a = 10
and µ0 = 100. That means that the timescale of
the solutal rolls is assumed 10 times larger than the
one of the thermal rolls. The latter appear only at
µ > 10, or 11 times the critical Rayleigh number of
the solutal rolls. The ratios found in the numerical
investigation of the full system are typically even
larger for realistic parameter combinations.

We assume all parameters b1, b2, ...e2 to be posi-
tive. A diﬀerent sign of any of these would lead to
unwanted features in the bifurcation scenario. Since
a ≫ 1 we can assume that for any two parameters p,
q ∈ {b1, b2, ...e2} the inequality p < aq holds. This
assumption will simplify our discussion below. We
can set b1 = b2 = 1 by normalizing the amplitudes
accordingly.

The equations (3) show several symmetry prop-
erties. They are invariant under an exchange of A
and B amplitudes, i.e., under exchange of x and
y. The absence of quadratic terms guarantees the

exist as forward bifurcating solutions. They are
plotted in Fig. 3 for b1 = b2 = 1 and a, µ0 as above.

preservation of the upﬂow–downﬂow symmetry of
the convective ﬁelds. A change of the sign of only
B1 and B2 or only A1 and A2 corresponds to a shift
of the x– or y–rolls by half a wavelength.

Furthermore, it is even possible to change the sign
of only one amplitude. However, this symmetry is
artiﬁcial. The real convection patterns must be con-
sidered as a nonlinear superposition of the solutal
and thermal patterns. Changing, e. g., in x–rolls
the direction of rotation of the solutal contribution
while leaving the thermal one unchanged is certainly
not a symmetry operation. Nevertheless we will add
terms that break this symmetry of eqs. (3) only in
the next section.

Although the bifurcation scenario of the simpli-
ﬁed model (3) disagrees qualitatively with that of
the full hydrodynamic ﬁeld equations in some points
it nevertheless facilitates to understand some other
features. Furthermore, the simpliﬁed model easily
allows to get analytical solutions for the stationary
structures: Every single mode can be set indepen-
dently to zero. The remaining equations can in the
stationary case then be rewritten as a linear system
with the squares of the nonzero amplitudes as vari-
ables. The unique solution is a linear function of
µ, and physically relevant in a µ–interval where all
amplitude squares are ≥ 0. We can conclude that
there are at maximum 16 diﬀerent stationary solu-
tions of eqs. (3) because there are 24 possible ways
to set some amplitudes to zero.

3.1 Thermal and solutal rolls

The ﬁrst kind of structures we discuss are x–rolls
with B1 = B2 = 0 as solutions of the subsystem

FIG. 3. Bifurcation of pure solutal (A1) and pure ther-
mal (A2) rolls of the model eqs. (3). Parameters are
a = 10, µ0 = 100, and b1 = b2 = 1.

As the only convective solution for small µ, the
solutal rolls are stable at onset. But the linear sta-
bility analysis shows that they lose stability in fa-
vor of the stronger thermal rolls at larger µ. The
stability is transfered via a third kind of rolls, the
intermediate or A1A2–rolls given by

(8)

These structures exist if there is an µ–interval where
both right–hand sides are > 0, what is always the
case. If b1b2 − d1d2 > 0 they bifurcate forward from
solutal to thermal rolls.

A bifurcation diagram showing all three kinds of
solutions and also their stability properties within
the restricted system (5) is shown in Fig. 4. Plot-
ted is only the interesting µ–range where stability is
transferred. The stable branches already look like a
caricature of the roll branch in the full system with
diﬀerent slopes in the Soret and Rayleigh regions.
However, there are also important qualitative dif-
ferences. In the full system, the roll branch consists
of one continuous structure, without the two bifur-
cation points that are found in the model system.

These bifurcation points will disappear when we
break the artiﬁcial symmetry present in the model
system.

Under the general requirements stated above the in-
termediate squares exist and they bifurcate forward
from solutal to thermal squares if ∆ > 0. The bi-
furcation branches of the diﬀerent square and roll
structures are plotted in Fig. 5.

FIG. 5. Square and roll structures of the model eqs. (3).
Squares (rolls) are represented by thick (thin) lines. Solid
(dashed) lines denote stable (unstable) structures. Bi-
furcation points of further interest are marked by circles.
Parameters are c1 = 0.96, c2 = 1.04, e1 = 0.68, e2 = 1.28
and otherwise as above.

The stability properties of the diﬀerent types of
squares against each other are analogous to those
of the rolls. But these are not all types of possible
instabilities. Since our model has four modes four
eigenvalues have to be investigated for all structures
found so far. We will brieﬂy discuss the respective
results.

Some instabilities are connected to the bifur-
cation points that are known already. For the
squares only those instabilities that can break the
(x ↔ y)–symmetry are still of interest.
It turns
out that solutal squares are stable against (x ↔
y)–antisymmetric (δA1, δB1)–perturbations every-
where if and only if c1 < b1. This inequality is
satisﬁed in the example case and therefore squares
are stable at onset as desired. Similarly, thermal
squares are stable against a type of (δA2, δB2)–
perturbations only if c2 < b2. This is not the case
and consequently the thermal squares have been
marked as unstable in Fig. 5.

∆ = (b1 + c1)(b2 + c2) − (d1 + e1)(d2 + e2) . (12)

These requirements have also consequences for

the stability of rolls: Solutal rolls, although sta-
ble against other x–roll structures for small µ are
unstable against δB1–perturbations if and only if
c1 > b1 as required for solutal squares to be sta-
ble. On the other hand, thermal rolls are stable
against δB2–perturbation when c2 < b2 and thermal
squares are unstable. Therefore, only the thermal
rolls are marked as stable in Fig. 5.

There are two other types of instability of rolls
that have to be discussed, namely the instabil-
ity of solutal A1–rolls against δB2–perturbations
and vice versa, of thermal A2–rolls against δB1–
perturbations. Both instabilities generate new bi-
furcation points that have been marked by large cir-
cles in the ﬁgure. Their position depends on the di
and ei. Due to the fact that e2 > d2, the new bifur-
cation point on the solutal roll branch lies at higher
µ than the bifurcation point to the intermediate
rolls, where the solutal rolls already lose stability.
Since e1 < d1, on the other hand, the new bifur-
cation point for thermal rolls lies on the otherwise
stable part of the thermal roll branch, destabilizing
it towards the region of smaller µ already before the
bifurcation point towards the intermediate rolls.

Placing the new bifurcation points this way no
new instabilities are to be expected for the in-
termediate rolls. They inherit stability against
δB2–perturbations and instability against δB1–
perturbations from the solutal rolls and transfer
these properties to the thermal rolls.

It should be pointed out that by choosing the pa-
rameters accordingly it is also possible to stabilize
the rolls in the whole µ–interval against perturba-
tions in y–direction, which is the scenario that can
be found at large L and small ψ where the square
patterns are always unstable.

Concerning the square structures we have to re-
mark that at the bifurcation point where the inter-
mediate squares branch oﬀ from the solutal squares
in fact not one but two eigenvalues go through zero
for symmetry reasons, namely both δA2– and δB2–
perturbations. Two types of crossroll branches ap-
pear here plus the intermediate squares as nonlin-
ear combination of the two. The same happens at
the bifurcation point of the intermediate and ther-
mal squares. Here also two new patterns emerge,

connected to growing δA1– and δB1–perturbations.
These bifurcation points are also marked by circles
as a reminder of the new branches that still have to
be discussed.

3.3 Crossroll structures

We have already pointed out above that at maxi-
mum 16 diﬀerent stationary structures exist within
the model (3). The most simple one is the ground
state where all amplitudes vanish. Furthermore we
have already discussed the A1–, A2–, and A1A2–
rolls that have their counterpart in y–direction, i. e.,
the B1–, B2–, and B1B2–rolls. Together with the
A1B1–, A2B2–, and A1B1A2B2–squares these are
10 structures so far. The remaining six are crossroll
structures, i. e., three–dimensional patterns lacking
the (x ↔ y)–symmetry of squares.

The ﬁrst two of these structures are the A1B2–
crossrolls and the B1A2–crossrolls that can be
mapped onto each other via the (x ↔ y)–symmetry
operation. The A1B2–crossrolls connect the A1–
rolls and the B2-rolls at the newfound bifurcation
points for the roll structures. Note that B–roll
branches would lie on the µ–axis in the plots since
only A2
2 is plotted. The stability analysis re-
veals two more bifurcation points on these branches
as it has to be since they connect the stable thermal
rolls to the twofold unstable solutal rolls.

1 + A2

The next pair are the A1B1A2– and A1B1B2–
crossrolls that branch oﬀ at the connection between
solutal and intermediate squares and end up at one
of the bifurcation point of the B1A2– and A1B2–
crossrolls, respectively.

The A1A2B2– and B1A2B2–crossrolls ﬁnally
emerge at the intermediate squares/thermal squares
bifurcation point. These too end up at the A1B2–
and B1A2–crossroll branches, at the other two re-
maining bifurcation points.

That completes the description of the station-
ary structures. The results are shown in Fig. 6,
together with the result of the full stability analy-
sis. The unimportant part of the solutal and ther-
mal roll and square branches have been cut oﬀ for
better visibility. At small µ solutal squares are sta-
ble. They lose their stability where two types of

crossrolls (A1B1A2, A1B1B2) and the intermediate
squares branch oﬀ. The intermediate squares gain
stability whereas the crossrolls are unstable. Tak-
ing only stationary structures into account the in-
termediate squares remain stable until a second bi-
furcation point, where again two crossroll branches
emerge (A1A2B2, B1A2B2) that are now stable.
The thermal squares on the other hand do not gain
stability. Next, the stable crossrolls meet a third
pair (A1B2, B1A2) that ﬁnally transfers stability to
the thermal rolls. The bifurcation diagram looks
qualitatively diﬀerent for other parameter combina-
tions but the inequalities that have to be fulﬁlled
to produce a diagram as in Fig. 6 can be derived
easily.

The picture is still not complete however. Al-
though all stationary instabilities have been iden-
tiﬁed now, there might be more bifurcation points
where time dependent patterns emerge. From the
otherwise stable branches only the mixed squares
and the B1A2B2– and A1A2B2-crossrolls can ex-
hibit oscillatory instabilities. For the given parame-
ters such instabilities do indeed occur. They desta-
bilize the parts of the branches between the circles
in Fig. 6. One can easily guess that this is the re-
gion where oscillatory crossrolls can be found. But
we want to discuss these structures in more detail
only in the full model.

4 The full model

The bifurcation diagram we found does already
show some of the properties of the scenario we
want to explain but turned out to have unwanted
bifurcation points. We will now show how in-
cluding terms that break the artiﬁcial extra sym-
metry leads to a much better model. There are
four more cubic terms preserving the symmetries
(A1, A2) ↔ (B1, B2), (A1, A2) ↔ (−A1, −A2), and
(B1, B2) ↔ (−B1, −B2). When ”...” denotes the
old right hand sides of (3) we enlarge the model as
follows

The new equations do not allow a sign reversal of
individual amplitudes anymore. However, the pres-
ence of the βi, γi, and ǫi alone still allows pure solu-
tal or thermal stationary roll solutions. This leads
again to unwanted bifurcation points. On the other
hand, when δi 6= 0 such solutions become impos-
sible. We will therefore discuss only these two and
set the other six to zero. Thus the model we discuss
here is

It is instructive to ﬁrst take a look at the im-

where the rolls ﬁnally become stable does not go
away when δi 6= 0.

In the lower plot one can observe a similar be-
havior for the square eigenvalues. In the simpliﬁed
system the solutal rolls are stable until one eigen-
value crosses the zero axis and the picture switches
to the now emerging intermediate squares. This bi-
furcation and also that between intermediate and
thermal squares becomes again imperfect for δi 6= 0.
For δi = 0, at the beginning of the intermediate
square interval two eigenvalues approach each other
on a very small µ–interval such that the curves look
discontinuous here. When they meet they form a
complex pair and only the real part is shown now.
This complex pair becomes critical in the middle of
the interval and gives rise to the emergence of the os-
cillatory crossrolls. After the pair separates rapidly
again one eigenvalues goes again through zero. The
squares remain unstable because the other eigen-
value remains positive.

Since for δi

6= 0 the bifurcation point between
solutal and intermediate squares vanishes, the ﬁrst
crossroll pair that emerges from the squares, the
A1B1A2– and A1B1B2–crossrolls must become dis-
connected from the square branch. But the oscil-
latory bifurcation and the other stationary bifur-
cation remain. For other parameters the scenario
is simpler. All eigenvalues stay real and only one
crosses the zero axis. When this is the case, only
stationary crossrolls appear.

Note that the pair of eigenvalues responsible
for the appearance of oscillatory crossrolls and the
eigenvalue of the stationary crossrolls are not inde-
pendent of each other. The latter emerges from the
former. This is a feature that can also be observed
in the full system of hydrodynamic ﬁeld equations.
A bifurcation diagram for slightly diﬀerent pa-
rameters and especially larger symmetry–breaking
terms δi is shown in Fig. 8. The stability proper-
ties are the same as in Fig. 1. They are not dis-
played here. The bifurcation diagram shows all the
properties already deducted from the eigenvalues.
The lower solutal, intermediate, and upper thermal
branches have fused to a smooth curve that nev-
ertheless still shows the characteristic upturning at
the transition from the Soret to the Rayleigh regime.

In the

pliﬁed system at the points where the intermediate
rolls emerge. The referring curves would cross the
zero axis here if the picture would not switch to the
intermediate rolls. For δi 6= 0 these bifurcations be-
come imperfect. The curves become smooth and do
not touch the zero axis anymore such that the two
bifurcation points vanish. The respective parts of
the solutal, intermediate, and thermal roll branches
fuse into one single branch. On the other hand,

5 Conclusion

The A1B1A2– and A1B1B2–crossrolls have become
disconnected from the square branch. The other
stationary crossroll bifurcation does still exist and
is preceded by an oscillatory crossroll bifurcation.
Qualitatively, the picture is exactly as in Fig. 1.

Before we conclude, we want to take a closer look
at the dynamics of the oscillatory crossrolls. Fig. 9
shows oscillations near the beginning (upper plot)
and the end (lower plot) of the oscillatory crossrolls
branch. Comparing to Fig. 2 one sees the same be-
havior: An oscillation in counterphase with grow-
ing amplitude, decreasing frequency, and growing
anharmonicity.

The details of the entrainment process that lead
from oscillatory crossrolls to the stationary type
shall not be discussed here, but they are diﬀerent
from what we found in the numerical simulations
of the full system of ﬁeld equations [12] although
similar transitions have been found in experiments
[11].

We found that the details of the dynamic behav-
ior of the model system (14) depends signiﬁcantly
on the chosen parameters. Thus, at present we con-
clude that our model equations (14) are capable of
qualitatively reproducing the bifurcation scenario of
Fig. 1 and the dynamics of crossrolls in Fig. 2 as
demonstrated in Figs. 8 and 9.

We have investigated the Rayleigh–B´enard convec-
tion in binary mixtures with a positive separation
ratio. We have shown that the observed bifurca-
tion scenario at small L, involving square patterns,
rolls, stationary and oscillatory crossrolls arises nat-
urally out of a simple system of two coupled ampli-
tude equation systems both consisting of two cubic
equations describing the dynamic of rolls in x– and
y–direction respectively. Attempts to extract such
a model from the basic equations are underway.

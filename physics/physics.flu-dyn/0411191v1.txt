Abstract

Three types of streamline topology in a K´arm´an vortex street ﬂow are shown

under the variation of spatial parameters. For the motion of dilute particles in

the K´arm´an vortex street ﬂow, there exist a route of bifurcation to a chaotic

orbit and more attractors in a bifurcation diagram for the proportion of par-

ticle density to ﬂuid density. Along with the increase of spatial parameters in

the ﬂow ﬁled, the bifurcation process is suspended, as well as more and more

attractors emerge. In the motion of dilute particles, a drag term and gravity

term dominate and result in the bifurcation phenomenon.

I. INTRODUCTION

The motions of particles in a nonuniform ﬂow have wide technological applications, such

as to forecast chemical reactions and environmental pollution. Due to particle motion in

the low Reynolds number category, the equation of motion for a small rigid sphere in a

nonuniform ﬂow ﬁeld is deduced [1]. When the background ﬂow is mainly dominated by

large scale structures, the ﬂuid viscosity is not included in the governing ﬂow equation

[2]. Related studies show that even when the background ﬂow ﬁelds are very simple, the

motions can have abundant phenomena. In a periodic Stuart vortex ﬂow, depending on the

values of parameters, the particles asymptotically concentrate along periodic, quasiperiodic

or chaotic open trajectory [3,4]. In a cellular ﬂow ﬁeld, aerosol particles also merge into

isolated asymptotic trajectories, which are described by slow manifolds [5,6]. Moreover, the

method due to the Lagrange view of particles can also be applied to investigate eﬀects of

particle dispersion on streamwise braid vortices in a plane mixing layer [7,8].

In a plane wake ﬂow behind a circular cylinder, a regular vortex street structure was

investigated at Re = 60 − 5000. Along with the advance of experimental technique, even at

Re = O(104), the regular vortex street is obtained by using the phase-average method [9].

In particular, the phenomena relating to organized vortex structure, such as, reconnection

of vortex street [10] and emergence of three dimensional vortex structure [11], arouse wide

interest for the transition of a plane wake ﬂow. Recently, particle focusing in narrow bands

near the peripheries of the vortex structures for the particle dispersion in a plane wake ﬂow

is observed experimentally [12]. By considering Stokes drag, the phenomenon of particle

focusing is studied on two dimensional centre manifolds [13]. The regular K´arm´an vortex

street ﬂow as a model to approach the plane wake ﬂow and investigate the above phenomena

plays an important role.

For the motion of particles in regular vortex street ﬂow, K´arm´an vortex spacing inﬂuences

on topological structure of background ﬂow ﬁeld. At the same time, a density ratio as a

basic parameter may have a wide range. In this paper, we will consider streamline topology

2

and dilute particle dynamics in the K´arm´an vortex street ﬂow in a range of density ratio.

In Sect. II, it is shown that for the K´arm´an vortex street ﬂow, there exist three types of

global topological structure depending on the spatial parameters in ﬂow ﬁeld. Dilute particle

dynamics in the K´arm´an vortex street ﬂow related to the density ratio is investigated in Sect.

III. Eﬀects of spatial parameters in ﬂow ﬁeld on dilute particle dispersion is determined in

Sect. IV. Finally, a brief summary is given in Sect. V.

vortices, respectively. The dimensionless quantities denoted by asterisks are introduced as

From now on, the asterisks ”*” for the dimensionless quantities in this section are omitted

for convenience. The stream function (2) has symmetries: Ψ(x+1/2, −y) = −Ψ(x, y), Ψ(x+

which has singularity at the vortex centers. In the case of removing the singularity by the

Rankine vortex [15], free stagnation points in velocity ﬁeld (3) consist of centers and saddle

points, which can be respectively described by (0, h

In the symmetry Ψ(x + 1/2, −y) = −Ψ(x, y), it can be shown that there exists a zero

streamline between two neighboring centers (0, h

2 ) and ( 1

2, − h

2 ). Under the variation of spatial

parameter h, we take zero streamlines to investigate the evolution of global topological

structure. The points y0, corresponding to zero streamlines passing through the y coordinate,

satisfy

y0 ∼ h in Fig. 1.

Using the Newton-Raphson and bisection methods [16], we solve Eq.(4) and plot the relation

as well as free stagnation points are only centers. All streamlines including an embedded zero

streamline for h = 0.001, which approach to those for h = 0, are drawn in Fig. 2(a). Two

neighboring vortices are divided by the zero streamline. In Fig. 1, there exists a minimum

point (0.164, 0.443434) marked by o. To understand this point, we take the derivative of

Ψ(0, y) with respect to h, as follows,

(5)

Using the Newton-Raphson and bisection methods [16], we solve Eq.(5) and plot the so-

lutions in Fig. 3(a). Besides a trivial solution y = h/2 of Eq.(5), other relations ±y ∼ h

are symmetrical and corresponding to the maximum and minimum of Ψ(0, y) for h. The

point (0.164,0.443434) exists in the curve y ∼ h marked by p, so that Ψ(0, 0.443434) is a

maximum of Ψ(0, y) for h. We also plot the relation of Ψ(0, 0.443434) to h in Fig. 3(b). The

maximum point q in the curve conﬁrms to the above result. Thus, the minimum point in

Fig. 1 corresponds to the maximum of Ψ(0, y) for h.

When h increases from 0 to 0.164, y0 monotonically decreases from ∞ to 0.443434 in

Fig. 1. All streamlines including an embedded zero streamline for h = 0.1 are drawn in

Fig. 2(b). In this case, saddle points emerge below or above the centers in opposition to the

4

zero streamlines. The orbits passing through saddle points go around the centers and come

back, as well as go to other saddle points, i.e., there exist homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits.

For h = 0.164, all streamlines including an embedded zero streamline are drawn in Fig. 2(c).

When h increases from 0.164, y0 monotonically increases from 0.443434 in Fig. 1. All

streamlines including an embedded zero streamline for h = 0.3 are drawn in Fig. 2(d). When

h increases to 0.410998, another solution of y0 emerges in Fig. 1. All associated streamlines

including embedded zero streamlines are drawn in Fig. 2(e). Zero streamlines, surrounding

each vortex, pass through the saddle points. So, the zero streamlines are homoclinic and

heteroclinic orbits. When h increases beyond 0.410998, the solution becomes two ones in

Fig. 1. At the time, there exist three zero streamlines. The orbits passing through saddle

points go around the centers and to other saddle points, but do not come back, i.e., there

exist only heteroclinic orbits. All streamlines including three embedded zero streamlines for

h = 0.6 are drawn in Fig. 2(f). Upper and lower vortices are divided by one zero streamline,

as well as surrounded by others.

In the experiment of a plane wake ﬂow [17], it has been shown that h increases down-

stream from 0.2 to 0.45 at Re = 140. We can thus conclude that three types of streamline

topology can emerge in a plane wake ﬂow.

and g∗ = g/g (T is the particle viscous relaxation time d2/(18ǫν)), we nondimensionlize Eq.

(6) and ignore the Basset history term. Thus, Eq. (6) can be described by

The parameters in Eqs. (11) can be taken as U

= 4m/s and d = 5 × 10−

5m from

∞

[12]. Since air is chosen as the ﬂuid media in the ﬂow, the properties of ﬂuid in Eqs. (11)

are described as ρ = 1.225kg/m3 and ν = 1.45 × 10−

5m2/s [19]. Moreover, the parameters

concerning the K´arm´an vortex street ﬂow are chosen as l = 0.1m, h = 0.3 and Γ = 1.

In the following, we investigate the motion of particles under the variation of density ratio

δ. Initial values of particles are taken as points in the ﬂow ﬁeld and their corresponding

ﬂow ﬁled velocity. Using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm, we integrate Eqs. (11)

with a time size τ = 0.001. After discarding transients, we plot points at x = 0 as a

bifurcation diagram. When the time size is changed to τ = 0.01, the bifurcation diagram is

still preserved.

In order to understand the dilute particle dynamics, we analyze orders of magnitude

of parameters in Eq. (8). For giving physical values in the calculation, the parameter fd

appear to be on the order 1. When δ is taken as the order 103 − 104 and d is ﬁxed as

the order 10−

5m, the parameters ǫ, T , A and B appear to be on the order 10−

of ﬂuid 3

2ǫA2u • ∇u and lift force term 1

2ǫA(Au − V) × ω have smaller orders than the drag

term (Au − V)fd and gravity term Bg in the Eq. (8). Therefore, the Eq. (8) is dominated

by the drag term and gravity term .

Moreover, concerning the stability of particle orbits, we take only the drag and gravity

terms in Eq. (8) to obtain an approximate fundamental matrix U t

x. By using the straight-

B. Numerical results

In Fig. 4, along with the increase of density ratio, a bifurcation diagram of y versus δ is

drawn. When δ < 6.5 × 102, the velocity of particle dispersion is very slow, so most of the

particle trajectories are preserved near the street. When δ ≥ 6.5 × 102, besides the particle

dispersion, global trajectories of particles converge to two attractors: one above the street,

the other in the street. For the attractor above the street in δ = 6.5 × 102 − 4.4 × 103, it

evolves as a period-1 orbit. At δ = 4.4 × 103, the period-1 orbit bifurcates to a period-2

orbit. In δ = 4.4 × 103 − 7.0 × 103, the attractor evolves as a period-2 orbit. At δ = 7.0 × 103,

the period-2 orbit bifurcates to a period-4 orbit. In δ = 7.0 × 103 − 7.9 × 103, the attractor

evolves as a period-4 orbit. In δ = 7.9 × 103 − 1.0 × 104, the period-4 orbit bifurcates to

a period-8 orbit and further to a quasi-periodic or chaotic orbit. At δ = 1.0 × 104, a crisis

happens, so that the quasi-periodic or chaotic orbit disappears. Moreover, at δ = 7.3 × 103,

a period-3 orbit emerges as another attractor above the street. In δ = 7.3 × 103 − 7.9 × 103,

the period-3 orbit bifurcates further to a quasi-periodic or chaotic orbit. At δ = 7.9 × 103,

a crisis happens, so that the quasi-periodic or chaotic orbit disappears. The bifurcation

procedure of period-3 orbit diﬀers from that for the three dimensional Lorenz equation [22].

For the attractor in the street, a period-1 orbit emerges at δ = 3.3 × 103. It preserves in

δ = 3.3 × 103 − 1.2 × 104.

In Fig. 5, we plot some typical examples for diﬀerent values of δ. A period-1 orbit above

the street for δ = 1.0 × 103, as well as all corresponding streamlines are drawn in Fig. 5(a).

On the period-1 orbit, the particles move from left to right. In Fig. 6, for the period-1 orbit,

the maximal Lyapunov exponent is -0.230, so the orbit is stable. In order to display the

dispersion of particles in the ﬂow ﬁeld, we also plot the basin of attraction in Fig. 7(a). In

the motion of particles, the points corresponding to those in the basin of attraction suspend

on the period-1 orbit. At the same time, the points corresponding to those outside the

basin of attraction escape from the central region of ﬂow. For δ = 3.5 × 103, in Fig. 5(b),

two period-1 orbits distribute above and in the street, respectively. On the period-1 orbit

8

above the street, the particles move from left to right. In Fig. 6, for the period-1 orbit, the

maximal Lyapunov exponent is -0.254, so the orbit is stable. But, on the orbit in the street,

the particles move in an opposite direction, i.e., from right to left. The maximal Lyapunov

exponent is -1.144, so the orbit is stable. For the two period-1 orbits, the corresponding

basins of attraction are plotted in Fig. 7(b). One is similar to that in Fig. 7(a), the other is

distributed in two local zones. The basin for the orbit in street is surrounded by that for the

orbit above street. For δ = 6.0 × 103, a period-2 orbit above the street and a period-1 orbit

in the street are drawn in Fig. 5(c). On the period-2 orbit above the street, the particles

move from left to right. In Fig. 6, for the period-2 orbit, the maximal Lyapunov exponent

is -0.604, so the orbit is stable. But, on the orbit in the street, the particles move in an

opposite direction, i.e., from right to left. The maximal Lyapunov exponent is -1.268, so

the orbit is stable. The corresponding basin of attraction is plotted in Fig. 7(c), which is

similar to Fig. 7(b). For δ = 7.5 × 103, a combined period-4 orbit with a period-3 above the

street and a period-1 orbit in the street are drawn in Fig. 5(d). On the period-4 and period-

3 orbits above the street, the particles move from left to right. But, on the orbit in the

street, the particles move in an opposite direction, i.e., from right to left. In Fig. 6, for the

period-4, period-3 and period-1 orbits, the maximal Lyapunov exponent are -1.003, -0.245

and -1.356, respectively, so the orbits are stable. The corresponding basin of attraction is

plotted in Fig. 7(d). The geometry of basin is diﬀerent from above ones in Figs. 7(a)-(c).

Some points near y = 1 escape from the basin of attraction in the dispersion of particles.

For δ = 9.5 × 103, a quasi-periodic or chaotic orbit above the street and a period-1 orbit in

the street are drawn in Fig. 5(e). On the orbit above the street, the particles move from

left to right. In Fig. 6, for the orbit, the maximal Lyapunov exponent is 0.850, so the orbit

is chaotic. But, on the orbit in the street, the particles move in an opposite direction, i.e.,

from right to left. The maximal Lyapunov exponent is -1.356, so the orbit is stable. The

corresponding basin of attraction is plotted in Fig. 7(e). For the period-1 orbit in the street,

the geometry of basin is similar to that in Fig. 7(d). But, for the chaotic orbit above the

street, escaped points in Fig. 7(e) permeate into the basin of attraction in Fig. 7(d), so

9

that the geometry of basin is fractal. From those examples, we can conclude that along with

the increases of density ratio, initial points distributed in the central region of ﬂow escape

more and more. At the same time, the particle trajectories bifurcate from periodic orbits to

chaotic orbits.

In order to explain the existence of attractors in the ﬂow ﬁeld, we take the period-1 and

period-2 orbits for δ = 6.0 × 103 as an example. In Fig. 8, we present the values of Vx, Vy,

uy and (Auy − Vy)fd − B along two orbits. For the period-2 orbit above the street, we plot

it in two times of the streamwise periodic length in Fig. 8(a). Since Vx > 0 in x ∈ [0, 2), the

motional direction of particles is from left to right. (1) When a particle moves from x = 0

to x = 0.486, the negative term (Auy − Vy)fd − B causes decrease of Vy from 0.050 to -0.285.

At the same time, it leads to increase the term (Auy − Vy)fd − B. (2) When the particle

moves from x = 0.486 to x = 0.930, the positive term (Auy − Vy)fd − B causes increase of Vy

from -0.285 to 0.404. At the same time, it leads to decrease the term (Auy − Vy)fd − B. (3)

When the particle moves from x = 0.930 to x = 1.554, the negative term (Auy − Vy)fd − B

causes decrease of Vy from 0.404 to -0.115. At the same time, it leads to increase the term

(Auy − Vy)fd − B. (4) When the particle moves from x = 1.554 to x = 1.946, the positive

term (Auy − Vy)fd − B causes increase of Vy from -0.115 to 0.067. At the same time, it leads

to decrease the term (Auy − Vy)fd − B. (5) When the particle moves from x = 1.946 to

x = 2, the negative term (Auy − Vy)fd − B causes decrease of Vy from 0.067 to 0.050. At

the same time, it leads to increase the term (Auy − Vy)fd − B. According to the periodic

boundary condition, when the particle reaches x = 2, it goes back to x = 0. Therefore,

the combination of the drag term and gravity term in the vertical direction has a periodic

vibration along with the variation of the vertical velocity of particles and makes the period-2

orbit. In Fig. 8(b), for the period-1 orbit in the street, we plot it in the streamwise periodic

length. Since Vx < 0 in x ∈ [0, 1), the motional direction of particles is from right to left.

In a similar way to Fig. 8(a), the term (Auy − Vy)fd − B brings into a periodic vibration

of particles and makes the period-1 orbit. In Ref. [13], by considering the drag term, the

essential dynamics takes place on the two-dimensional centre manifolds. To compare with

10

the result, we ﬁnd the bifurcation process disappears when eliminate the gravity term in

Eq. (8). From the above observation, we can conclude that the drag term and gravity term

lead to the bifurcation behavior in dilute particle dispersion. The motional direction of

particles and distribution of uy determine the vertical position of attractors.

IV. EFFECTS OF SPATIAL PARAMETERS IN FLOW FIELD ON DILUTE

PARTICLE DISPERSION

In the Sect. II, we show three types of streamline topology in the K´arm´an vortex street

ﬂow at diﬀerent spatial parameter h. In the Sect. III, we present the dilute particle dynamics

for the ﬂow ﬁeld with h = 0.3. In the following, we increase the spatial parameter h to

consider its eﬀects on dilute particle dispersion.

For h = 0.410998, along with the increase of density ratio, a bifurcation diagram y

versus δ is drawn in Fig. 9. The global evolution is similar to that in Fig. 4. However, the

bifurcation of period-1 attractor above the street is delayed. The period-1 orbit above the

street bifurcates to a period-2 orbit at δ = 6.6 × 103. The period-2 orbit bifurcates to a

period-4 orbit at δ = 1.04 × 104. In δ = 1.04 × 104 − 1.2 × 104, the period-4 orbit bifurcates

further to a quasi-periodic or chaotic orbit. A period-3 orbit above the street emerges at

δ = 7.0 × 103 and bifurcates in δ = 7.0 × 103 − 8.3 × 103. At δ = 8.3 × 103, a crises

happens, so that the quasi-periodic or chaotic orbit above the street disappears. Moreover,

the occurrence of period-1 attractor in the street is shifted earlier at δ = 2.0 × 103. A

bifurcation of period-3 orbit in the street emerges in δ = 9.4 × 103 − 1.1 × 104.

For h = 0.6, along with the increase of density ratio, a bifurcation diagram y versus

δ is drawn in Fig. 10. The global evolution is similar to that in Fig. 9. However, the

bifurcation of period-1 attractor above the street is delayed. The period-1 orbit above

the street bifurcate to a period-2 orbit at δ = 9.1 × 103. The period-2 orbit is preserved in

δ = 9.1 ×103 −1.2 ×104. At the same time, the occurrence of period-1 attractor in the street

is shifted earlier at δ = 2.0×102. Moreover, at δ = 7.6×103, a period-4 and a period-3 orbits

11

emerge above the street. They bifurcate further to two quasi-periodic or chaotic orbits and

disappear at δ = 8.4×103 and δ = 8.5×103, respectively. In δ = 8.0×103−9.4×103, a similar

bifurcation process of more attractors emerges in the street. In δ = 8.0 × 103 − 8.8 × 103, a

period-4 orbit preserves in the street. In δ = 8.4 × 103 − 9.4 × 103, a bifurcation of period-3

orbit exists in the street.

Thus, along with the increase of h, a period-1 orbit above the street bifurcates slower

to a quasi-periodic or chaotic orbit, as well as a period-1 orbit in the street emerges earlier.

Besides the main attractors in the ﬂow ﬁeld, more and more local attractors also appear

above and in the street.

V. CONCLUSION

Under the variation of spatial parameters, we have shown three types of streamline

topology in a K´arm´an vortex street ﬂow. For the motion of dilute particles in the K´arm´an

vortex street ﬂow, there exist a route of bifurcation to a chaotic orbit and more attractors

in a bifurcation diagram for the proportion of particle density to ﬂuid density. Along with

the increase of spatial parameters in the ﬂow ﬁled, the bifurcation process is suspended, as

well as more and more attractors emerge. In the motion of dilute particles, a drag term and

gravity term dominate and result in the bifurcation phenomenon.

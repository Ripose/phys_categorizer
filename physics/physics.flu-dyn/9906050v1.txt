Abstract

The variational principle of barotropic Eulerian ﬂuid dynamics is known to
be quite cumbersome containing as much as eleven independent functions. This
is much more than the the four functions (density and velocity) appearing in
the Eulerian equations of motion. This fact may have discouraged applications
of the variational method. In this paper a four function Eulerian variational
principle is suggested and the implications are discussed brieﬂy.

Introduction

The motion of a ﬂuid is usually described in two ways. In the Lagrangian approach
we follow the trajectory of each ﬂuid particle. While in the Eulerian approach we
study the evolution of the velocity and density ﬁelds.

Variational principles have been developed in both cases. A variational principle
in terms of Lagrangian variables has been described by Eckart [1] and Bretherton
[2]. While a variational principle in term of the Eulerian variables is given by Herivel
[3], Serrin [4], Lin [5] and Seliger & Whitham [6].

The Eulerian approach appears to be much more appealing involving measurable
quantities such as velocity and density ﬁelds instead of the trajectories of unseen
particles of the Lagrangian approach.

However, regretfully the variational principle of the Eulerian ﬂow appears to be
much more cumbersome than the Lagrangian case, containing quite a few ”Lagrange
multipliers” and ”potentials”. In fact the total number of independent functions in
this formulation according to the approach suggested by Herivel [3], Serrin [4] and
Lin [5] is eleven which exceeds by many the four functions of velocity and density
appearing in the Eulerian equations of a barotropic ﬂow.

The variational principle of the Lagrangian approach is on the other hand simple
and straightforward to implement. Bretherton [2] has suggested to use the La-
grangian variational principle with Eulerian variables and especially constructed

1

”Eulerian displacements” for which the equations of motion are derived. This pro-
cedure appears to be inconvenient for stability and numerical calculations.

Instead I intend to develop in this paper a simpler variational principle in terms
of Eulerian variables. This will be done by rearranging the terms in the original
variational principle and using a simple trick to be discussed below. The result will
be a variational principle in terms of four Eulerian independent functions which is
the appropriate number.

The plan of this paper is as follows: ﬁrst I review the original Eulerian variational
principle and the equations derived from it. Than I derive a new variational principle
and discuss its implications.

2 The Eulerian Approach to the Barotropic Flow

In the Eulerian description of barotropic ﬂuid dynamics we seek a solution for the
velocity ~v = ~v(xk, t) and density ρ = ρ(xk, t) ﬁelds of a given ﬂow. Those ﬁelds
depend on the space coordinates ~r = (xk) = (x, y, z) [k, l, m, n = 1, 2, 3] and on the
time variable t. The ﬁelds are obtained by solving the Euler equations:

∂~v
∂t

+ ~v

~

~v + ~
∇

·

(h + Φ) = 0

= ∂

in which ~
∂xk . The potential Φ = Φ(xk, t) is a given function of coordinates,
∇
while h = h(ρ) is the speciﬁc enthalpy which is a given function of ρ usually des-
ignated as the equation of state. In addition the density and velocity ﬁelds must
satisfy the continuity equation :

∂ρ
∂t

+ ~

∇ ·

(ρ~v) = 0.

Thus we have to solve four equations in order to obtain four unknown ﬁelds. This
can be done when supplemented the appropriate boundary conditions.

2.1 The Classical Eulerian Variational Principle

Researchers (Herivel [3], Serrin [4], Lin [5]) seeking a variational principle from which
the Euler and continuity equations (equation (1) and equation (2)) can be derived,
arrived at the action A given in terms of the Lagrangian L as:

The volume element is given by d3x and the operator D

. The variation principle contains in addition to the desired four functions ρ, ~v

also the seven ”potentials” ν, ~α, ~β reaching to a total of eleven variational variables.
Varying the above action with respect to those variables such that the variations
vanish for ~r and t suﬃciently large. We see that in order to have δA vanish for
otherwise arbitrary (δ~v, δρ, δν, δ~α, δ~β), the following equations must be satisﬁed:

2.2 The Variational Principle of Seliger & Witham
Seliger & Witham [6] have proposed to take ~α = (α, 0, 0) and ~β = (β, 0, 0), in
this way one obtains a variational principle with only seven functions. Rewriting
equations (5,7,8,9,10) for this case we obtain the following set of equations :

We see that equations (12, 16) remain unchanged. The velocity ~v is given now by the
Clebsch representation (equation (13) ) and the entire set of equations are designated

as Clebsch’s transformed equations of hydrodynamics (Eckart [1], Lamb [7] p. 248).
Bretherton [2] have quoted a remark by H. K. Moﬀat concerning the possibility of
the function ν being not single valued. According to Moﬀat [8] the helicity integral:

=

~
∇ ×
which is a measure of the knottedness of the vortex lines, must be zero if ν is single
valued which is clearly not true in general. This can be shown as follows: suppose
that ν is single valued than by inserting equation (13)
into equation (17) and
integrating by parts we obtain:

An analogue from classical mechanics may make things even clearer. A few
will object to describe the two dimensional motion of a particle moving under the
inﬂuence of the potential V (R) (where R is the radial coordinate), by the coordinates
R, φ. Where φ is the azimuthal angel which is not single valued. This form is found
to be more convenient than the single valued Cartesian x, y representation.

3 The Reduced Variational Principle

Although Seliger & Witham (1968) have managed to reduce the Eulerian variational
principle from eleven to seven functions. The number of variational variables is
still too much, since the Eulerian equations contain only four unknown functions. I
intend to suggest a solution to this problem here.

First let us rewrite the Lagrangian of Seliger & Witham (equation (3) with α

and β being scalars):

The Lagrangian L is dissected into a part depending on the ﬂuid velocity ~v which is
denoted as Lv and the remaining part which does not depend on ~v which is denoted
Lr. Let us look at the action:

t1

Ar =

Lrdt.

t0
Z
This action is a functional of the four variables: α, β, ν, ρ. Note that the last term of
Lr is a full time diﬀerential and thus does not contribute to the equations of motion.
In order to simplify the variational calculations we introduce the notations:

Using the above notations and assuming that the arbitrary variations (δρ, δν, δα, δβ)
vanish for ~r and t suﬃciently large we obtain that δAr = 0 only if the following
equations are satisﬁed:

If we take ~u to be a Clebsch representation of some velocity ﬁeld ~v = ~u, than the
above equations become the Clebsch transformed equations of ﬂuid motion (equa-
tions 12,14,15,16). Thus we have achieved a variational principle that does not
contain ~v as a variational variable. This situation in which only the potentials ap-
pear in the variational principle but not the physical velocity ﬁeld ~v itself is familiar
from other branches of physics and will be discussed below.

It remains to discuss the Lagrangian Lv given in equation (26) , using the theorem

of Gauss and the deﬁnition (28) of ~u we arrive at the form:

Lv =

If we take ~u to be a Clebsch representation of ~v than the ﬁrst part of Lv vanishes.
Further more the surface integral remaining vanish for both ﬂuids contained in a
vessel in which ~v is parallel to the vessels surface and for astrophysical ﬂows in
which the density vanishes on the surface of the ﬂow. However, in the case of helical
ﬂows ν is not single-valued and one must add in addition to the physical surface a
”cut”. Thus one obtains:

Lv =

[ν]ρ~v

d~S

·

Zcut

where [ν] represents the discontinuity of ν across the ”cut”. We conclude that
for helical ﬂows Lv does not vanish altogether. And thus for those ﬂows the new
Lagrangian Lr is not equal to the Seliger & Witham Lagrangian L, the diﬀerence
being a surface integral over the ”cut”.

3.1 A Comment Regarding Esthetics

It was already noted that the last term of Lr given in equation (25) does not
contribute to equations of motion. It seem esthetically plausible to omit this term
altogether thus obtaining:

3.2 Potentials as Lagrangian Variables

The Lagrangian Ls contains variables (α, β, ν) that have no physical meaning outside
the context of the Clebsch representation. This is also the situation in electromag-
netics in which the Lagrangian (see for example Goldstein (1980) p. 582) is given
by:

In which ~A, A0 are the vector and scalar electromagnetic potentials, e is the charge

is solved in terms of the potentials ~A, A0 the physical electric ~E and magnetic ~B
ﬁelds can be obtained through the relations:

which are analogue to the Clebsch representation given by equation (13) in the ﬂuid
dynamical case.

3.3

Linearity in Time Derivatives

Another odd characteristic of the Lagrangian Ls given by equation (39)
is that
it contains only linear terms in time derivatives. This is unlike the generic case
in classical mechanics in which terms quadratic in time derivatives appear in the
kinetical energy part the Lagrangian. For this situation I have been able to ﬁnd an
analogue from quantum mechanics. The Schroedinger Lagrangian is given by:

Ls.

4 Conclusions

Although a compact variational principle have been obtained in equation (39)
it
remains to see the possible implications of this expression. One possible utility is
to obtain better numerical algorithms for solving ﬂuid ﬂow problems based on the
above variational principle (see Yahalom [10]). Another may be to study the stability
of certain stationary ﬂows in the spirit of the works by Katz, Inagaki & Yahalom
[11] and Yahalom, Katz & Inagaki [12].

2Not the matter density!

7

Further More, it is also desirable to have a variational principle for incompressible
ﬂows which should contain only three functions since the density is not a variable
in this case. A similar reduction in degrees of freedom should be obtained for two
dimensional ﬂows in which the velocity has only two components. The above list
of extensions of the Eulerian variational principles is of course not comprehensive.
And the undertakings mentioned are left for future papers.

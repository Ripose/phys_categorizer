Eﬀect of the Earth’s Coriolis force on the large-scale circulation of turbulent
Rayleigh-B´enard convection

Eric Brown and Guenter Ahlers

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We present measurements of the large-scale circulation (LSC) of turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard con-
vection in water-ﬁlled cylindrical samples of heights equal to their diameters. The orientation of
the LSC had an irregular time dependence, but revealed a net azimuthal rotation with an average
period of about 3 days for Rayleigh numbers R >∼ 1010. On average there was also a tendency
for the LSC to be aligned with upﬂow to the west and downﬂow to the east, even after physically
rotating the apparatus in the laboratory through various angles. Both of these phenomena could be
explained as a result of the coupling of the Earth’s Coriolis force to the LSC. The rate of azimuthal
rotation could be calculated from a model of diﬀusive LSC orientation meandering with a potential
barrier due to the Coriolis force. The model and the data revealed an additional contribution to the
potential barrier that could be attributed to the cooling system of the sample top which dominated
the preferred orientation of the LSC at high R. The tendency for the LSC to be in a preferred
orientation due to the Coriolis force could be cancelled by a slight tilt of the apparatus relative to
gravity, although this tilt aﬀected other aspects of the LSC that the Coriolis force did not.

I.

INTRODUCTION

≡

The problem of Rayleigh-B´enard convection (RBC)
consists of a ﬂuid sample heated from below [1, 2, 3].
In our case the sample was a cylindrical container ﬁlled
with water. This system is deﬁned by three parameters:
αg∆T L3/κν (α is the isobaric
the Rayleigh number R
thermal expansion coeﬃcient, g the acceleration of grav-
ity, ∆T the applied temperature diﬀerence, L the height
of the sample, κ the thermal diﬀusivity, and ν the kine-
ν/κ, and the
matic viscosity), the Prandtl number σ
aspect ratio Γ
D/L (D is the diameter of the sam-
ple). Convection of heat occurs primarily as a result of
the emission of volumes of hot ﬂuid known as “plumes”
from a bottom thermal boundary layer that rise due to
a buoyant force, while cold plumes emitted from a top
boundary layer sink. In the turbulent regime of Γ = 1
samples that we studied, these plumes drive a large-scale
circulation (LSC) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] which is oriented
nearly vertically with up-ﬂow and down-ﬂow on opposite
sides of the sample.

While the LSC conﬁguration does not have the cylin-
drical symmetry of the sample, we found that the struc-
ture underwent an erratic azimuthal motion that allowed
it to sample all angles over time. We showed elsewhere
that, on a long time scale (days), this azimuthal mo-
tion could be partly described as a diﬀusive process. We
believe it to be driven by the intense turbulent ﬂuc-
tuations that prevail throughout the system.
Interest-
ingly, relatively sudden re-orientations through various
angles (with durations of order minutes) were superim-
posed onto the diﬀusive motion at intervals much longer
than their duration. These re-orientations could occur
via two distinct mechanisms. One of these (a “rotation”)
consisted of a relatively fast rotation of the circulation
plane (or of the vorticity vector of the LSC) without sig-

niﬁcant change of the circulation speed (or of the magni-
tude of the vorticity vector). The other (a “cessation”)
involved the complete decay of the circulation, followed
by a spontaneous new start with a diﬀerent orientation.
These processes and their statistical properties have been
discussed in detail in previous work [12, 13].

Over long time scales (days) we found that the LSC
did not sample all angles equally, suggesting that the
azimuthal diﬀusion was subject to some asymmetric po-
tential.
In addition, the meanderings of the LSC ori-
entation occasionally added up to rotations through ap-
proximately 2π, which we refer to as “revolutions”. For
R >
1010 clockwise (when viewed from above) revo-
∼
lutions were found to be more frequent than counter-
clockwise ones. In this paper we report on these mea-
surements, and develop a simple model for the eﬀect of
the Coriolis force on the LSC that explains many of these
observations. Experimentally, the strongest qualitative
evidence for the inﬂuence of the Coriolis force on the LSC
is a change in the sample frame of the azimuthal loca-
tion of the preferred orientation that occurred when the
entire apparatus was rotated through a constant angle γ
in the laboratory frame.

In order to develop the model, we show that the
Earth’s rotation applies a torque to the horizontal ﬂow
components near the top and bottom plate that by itself
and in the northern hemisphere would induce a rotation
in the clockwise direction. In the absence of dissipation
the torque in turn would be diminished by this rotation,
leading to a rotation frequency precisely equal to that
required for the torque to vanish and for the orientation
of the LSC plane to be steady in an inertial frame. In
the physical system one also needs to consider the dis-
sipation experienced near the side wall and the top and
bottom plates; we introduced this dissipation into the
model by considering the viscous drag across a laminar

boundary layer and found that it reduces the rotation
frequency. Next we need to introduce the coupling of the
Earth’s rotation to the vertical components of the ﬂow
near the side wall. It imposes a preferred orientation that
is just north of west and that provides an azimuthally
varying potential. This potential interferes with the ro-
tation, and the two eﬀects mentioned so far would impose
a unique LSC orientation near the minimum of the po-
tential. However, the turbulent background ﬂuctuations
that we have neglected up to now couple to the LSC and
cause a meandering in the neighborhood of the poten-
tial minimum, and induce occasional transitions across
the potential barrier that result each time in a rotation
through approximately one revolution in either direction.
The clockwise and counter-clockwise transitions are not
equivalent because the coupling to the horizontal veloc-
ity components provides a slanting background to the po-
tential (a “washboard” potential), leading to a preference
for rotations in the clockwise direction when viewed from
above, as seen in the experiment. Earlier [12] we showed
that the LSC meandering has some qualities of a diﬀusive
process, and derived its azimuthal diﬀusivity from mea-
surements of the long-time angular ﬂuctuations of the
LSC orientations. We now use these diﬀusivities, which
vary with R, in a stochastic model based on the potential
discussed above to derive expressions for the probabil-
ity distribution of the LSC orientation, for total number
of rotations, and for the excess number of rotations in
the clockwise direction from a Fokker-Planck equation.
These results reproduce many of our experimental mea-
surements. However, the model does not explain why the
net rotation is absent for R <∼ 1010. At large R we also
found that, in addition to the Coriolis force, we had to
invoke an additional azimuthal asymmetry (associated
with small imperfections of the apparatus) in order to
explain all of our data over wide parameter ranges.

It is interesting to compare our results with experi-
ments by Hart et al. [14] where turbulent RBC samples
of size comparable to ours were rotated deliberately at
a constant rate in the laboratory frame about a vertical
axis. That work involved rotation rates Ω much larger
than the Earth’s rotation, and therefore imposed much
larger Coriolis forces upon the LSC. It showed that the
LSC underwent an azimuthal precession in the frame of
the rotating sample and in the retrograde direction at
a rate which was proportional to Ω when Ω was not too
large. We also ﬁnd a net rotation of the LSC in the clock-
wise (i.e. retrograde) direction. However, when scaled by
the axial component of Ω its rate is larger by a factor of
three or so. In this comparison it should be considered
10−5 rad/s is more
that the Earth’s rotation rate of 7.3
than two orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest
experimental Ω values used in Ref. [14]. A possible ex-
planation for the quantitative diﬀerence may be found in
a greater role of viscous dissipation at the larger Ω values
used in Ref. [14].

×

Hart et al. also developed a model for the coupling
of the Coriolis force created by their deliberate rotation

2

to their LSC that in some ways is similar to ours. How-
ever, in their case the coupling is only to the horizontal
velocity component because the rotation axis is parallel
to the vertical ﬂow. Their model thus has no potential
extrema, the rotation of the LSC is only in the retrograde
direction, and stochastic eﬀects need not be invoked to
yield rotation. When we set the latitude equal to π/2 in
our model and neglect stochastic eﬀects, our model be-
comes equivalent to that of Hart et al., except that those
authors used a diﬀerent approach toward modeling the
dissipation.

While the Coriolis force plays a major part in many
geophysical and astrophysical convection systems, it is
rare that it can be observed in laboratory ﬂuid-ﬂow ex-
periments because of the small magnitude of the force on
laboratory scales. One example is high-precision mea-
surements of the velocity proﬁle of laminar ﬂow in a long
pipe [15]. It was found that the expected parabolic proﬁle
of the velocity ﬁeld was skewed by the Earth’s rotation.
In that case it was possible to carry out a quantitative
calculation of this eﬀect based on the equation of motion
(the Navier-Stokes equation) of the system because the
unperturbed velocity was known analytically, the velocity
ﬁeld remained time independent, and the Coriolis-force
perturbation could be calculated at linear order. For our
system the turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld is much more complicated
and a full treatment based on the equation of motion
does not seem feasible except perhaps by direct numeri-
cal simulation. Thus we resorted to the simpliﬁed model
described above.

A careful study of the eﬀects of the Earth’s Coriolis
force could prove useful for understanding and analyzing
data in other high-precision RBC experiments. For in-
stance, our study made it possible to explore other asym-
metries that aﬀected the LSC in our experiment, in par-
ticular eﬀects due to our top-plate cooling-system and to
small deliberate misalignments relative to gravity [16].

In the next section we describe brieﬂy the experimen-
tal measurements; a more detailed account of the appa-
ratus had been provided before [17]. Section III A gives
the results accumulated over many months for the az-
imuthal rotation of the LSC. Data for the diﬀusivity of
the LSC meandering are given in Sect. III B. The mea-
surements of the probability distribution of the LSC ori-
entation are discussed in Sect. III C. Measurements of
the instantaneous rotation rate turn out to be useful to
determine a parameter of the model, and thus are given
in Sect. III D. In Sect. IV we present a model for the
interaction between the Earth’s Coriolis force, the LSC,
and the background turbulence of the system. In a num-
ber of subsections we derive predictions for several prop-
erties of the LSC and compare them with experimental
results. The properties include the preferred orientation,
the eﬀect of dissipation, the probability distribution of
the LSC orientation, the net rotation rate, and the to-
tal rate of occurrence of revolutions. Comparison with
other experiments is provided as well. The inﬂuence of
azimuthal imperfections in the sample cell, we believe

primarily due to the cooling system of the top plate, is
incorporated in the model in Sect. V. Section VI con-
siders the inﬂuence of a slight misalignment relative to
gravity of the sample, and discusses how this tilt can in
part cancel the Coriolis-force eﬀects. A summary and
some conclusions are presented in Sect. VII.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

≈

The experiments were done with two cylindrical sam-
1 that were the medium and
ples with aspect ratio Γ
large sample described in detail elsewhere [17]. Both had
circular copper top and bottom plates with a plexiglas
side wall that ﬁt into a groove in each plate. The plate
surfaces that touched the ﬂuid sample were nominally
symmetric and ﬁne machined to a roughness of less that
2 micro-m. The side walls had variations of their diame-
ter of less than 10−2 cm. There was a small semi-circular
hole 1.6 mm in diameter at the edge of each plate that
was used for ﬁlling and to allow expansion of the ﬂuid.
There were no internal sensors or other structures that
could lock the ﬂow direction. A resistive heater wire was
embedded in the bottom plate in such a way that it cov-
ered all regions of the plate equally for even heating. The
top plate contained a double-spiral water-cooled channel
which covered all regions of the plate, with inlet and out-
let on opposite sides of the plate. The medium sample
had dimensions D = 24.81 cm and L = 24.76 cm. The
large sample had D = 49.67 cm and two side walls which
could be interchanged with L = 50.61 and L = 49.54
cm. Each apparatus was ﬁlled with de-ionized de-gassed
water and the average temperature of the bottom and
top plates was kept at 40.0◦ C where σ = 4.38. The
two samples of diﬀerent physical size allowed us to cover
a larger range of R at the same σ and Γ, so the overall
108 <∼ R <∼ 1011. Both samples were
range studied was 3
carefully levelled to better than 0.001 rad, except for the
experiments in which we deliberately tilted the samples.
Eight blind holes, equally spaced azimuthally in the
horizontal mid-plane of the samples, were drilled from
the outside into each side wall. Thermistors were placed
into them so as to be within d = 0.07 cm of the ﬂuid
surface. They were numbered i = 0, . . . , 7 in the counter-
clockwise direction when viewed from above, with ther-
mistor 0 normally located in an easterly position except
at times when the entire apparatus was rotated in the
clockwise direction through an additional angle γ. Since
the LSC carried warm (cold) ﬂuid from the bottom (top)
plate up (down) the side wall, these thermistors detected
the location of the upﬂow (downﬂow) of the LSC by in-
dicating a relatively high (low) temperature. No parts
of the thermistors extended into the sample where they
might have perturbed the ﬂow structure of the ﬂuid.

separately at each time step, to these eight readings. Ex-
amples of such ﬁts have been shown previously [12, 13].
The ﬁt parameter δ is a measure of the amplitude of
the LSC and θ0 is the azimuthal orientation of the plane
of the LSC circulation in the sample frame. As deﬁned
here, the orientation θ0 is on the side of the sample where
the LSC is up-ﬂowing and is measured relative to the
location of thermometer zero. Typically the uncertain-
ties for a single measurement were about 13% for δ and
0.02 rev.
for θ0. When we ﬁt the side-wall thermistor-
temperatures to get θ0, the ﬁt only determined the value
of θ0 modulo 2π.
In order to track θ0 continuously
through many azimuthal rotations we chose the value
that was within π of the value measured at the previous
time step.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Revolutions and net rotation of the LSC

Elsewhere we presented measurements of sudden re-
orientations of the plane of circulation of the LSC
through a continuum of possible angles ∆θ [12]. They
were relatively rare events in that their collective du-
ration took up only a small fraction of the observation
time. They assumed the form of either cessations, where
the ﬂow actually stopped before re-starting in a new
randomly chosen orientation, or of rotations where the
ﬂow continued but its vorticity vector rotated relatively
rapidly through some angle ∆θ. Rotations and Cessa-
tions typically occurred rather quickly, in the time span
of about one turnover time of the LSC (which is on the
order of 100 s). Here we focus on yet another event which
was like a rotation in the sense that the LSC orientation
changed without a signiﬁcant change of the LSC speed,
but the change in orientation ∆θ was close to 2π and re-
quired a larger time interval, typically of an hour or so (of
order 30 turnover times). These events will be referred to
as “revolutions”. An illustration of a revolution is given

in ﬁg. 1. After a revolution the orientation (modulo 2π)
is essentially the same as it was before that event.
In
our previous analysis [12] revolutions were too slow to be
counted as rotations.

We shall show below that revolutions are associated
with diﬀusive motion in a periodic potential with a min-
imum at a particular azimuthal orientation. This po-
tential is created to a large extent by the coupling of
the Earth’s Coriolis force to the LSC. It turns out that
clockwise revolutions are more frequent than counter-
clockwise ones, leading to a net rotation over long time
periods. This asymmetry again can be explained in terms
of the Coriolis force.

×

An example of net rotation of the LSC for the large
1010 is seen in a time series of θ0(t)
sample at R = 8.9
shown in Fig. 2. There is a net rotation of 17 clockwise
revolutions over 18 days.
Inspection of the time series
shows that the LSC had a tendency to remain aligned
near a preferred orientation θm much of the time, but
that it occasionally underwent signiﬁcant positive or neg-
ative rotations before locking in again near θm (modulo
2π) as illustrated in Fig. 1.

−

To facilitate automated data analysis, we deﬁne a pos-
itive revolution as an event where θ0(t) rotates from
π/4 < θ0 < θm + π/4 to the range
the range θm −
(θm + 2π)
π/4 < θ0 < (θm + 2π) + π/4. A nega-
tive revolution is the analogous change of approximately
2π. We require the orientation to come within a small
−
range of θm to make sure that each revolution counted
is a rotation of approximately 2π and not jitter around
π. Let us describe the sequence of N rev-
an angle θm ±
olutions by a sequence of N numbers ri which are equal
to 1 (-1) for a counter-clockwise (clockwise) revolution.
The net rotation
is then equal to the sum of the N
values of ri. For every adjacent pair of values ri and ri+1
we compute the product di = riri+1. The parameter di
will be equal to 1 if the two members of the pair of ri
correspond to rotations in the same direction, and equal
to -1 otherwise. The sum
1 di is a measure
of the correlation between successive events.

109 <∼ R <∼ 1011, we found a net
covering the range 3
77, corresponding to 77 clockwise revo-
rotation
lutions out of a total of N = 439 revolutions. The net
correlation between successive events over this time was
= 1; the smallness of this number relative to the to-
D
tal number of revolutions N shows that the directions
of successive revolutions were not correlated with each
other, and that the net rotation was not due to a long
time scale over which the LSC rotated in one direction.

for each revolution to be either in the positive or neg-
ative direction, we would expect that the net rotation
after N = 439 revolutions would be less than about one
√N which is approximately 21
standard deviation σN ≡
revolutions. Thus the observations of 77 clockwise rev-
olutions, corresponding to 3.7 σN away from a mean of
zero, indicate that the net rotation is a real eﬀect with
a conﬁdence limit of 99.98%. The average rate of net
rotation in the large sample was ωR =
0.08 rev.
−
per day (clockwise is negative in our coordinates). In the
108 <∼ R <∼ 1010,
medium sample, covering the range 3
there were only 9 net counter-clockwise revolutions out
8
of a total of 331 revolutions over 194 days, and
for an average rate of ωR = 0.05
0.09 rev. per day. One
sees that the results from the medium sample are consis-
tent with no net rotation, and at the least they indicate a
smaller rotation rate than was found in the large sample.
We compare our data to an experiment by Hart et al.
[14] with Γ = 1 and Prandtl number σ = 8.4 that stud-
ied the eﬀect on the LSC of the Coriolis force due to
rotating a convection apparatus at various applied rota-
tion rates Ω over the range 0.015 rad/s <∼ Ω <∼ 0.7 rad/s.
Two samples were used; one was about the same size as
our large and another a little smaller than our medium
sample. For their large sample the authors reported no
net rotation of the LSC for R <∼ 1010 but a net rota-
0.23Ω in the rotating sample frame for
tion of ωR =
1011 [18]. This is seemingly consistent with
R
2.9
our rotation rate of ωR = (
0.08)Ω, even though
−
their applied rotation rates were several orders of mag-
nitude larger than our (i.e.
the Earth’s) rotation rate
10−5 rad/s, although later we will show that
Ω = 7.3
such a straightforward comparison is probably not cor-
rect. It is also interesting that neither experiment found
net rotation in the smaller sized apparatus, which yielded
data only for the range R <∼ 1010.

B. Azimuthal diﬀusion of the LSC

The re-orientations (cessations and rotations) were rel-
atively rare and their duration occupied a relatively short
fraction of a given long time series. During the remainder
of the time the azimuthal orientation θ0 meandered in a
seemingly random manner. Elsewhere we reported that

Dθ = 4.45
do not occur very frequently, that analysis had used time
series of θ0 that included all re-orientations even though
these events could not be described by simple diﬀusion.
Motivated by the present need for more accurate val-
ues of Dθ, we repeated the analysis after ﬁltering our
re-orientations. The procedure is illustrated in Fig. 3.
There the solid line represents a short section of the orig-
inal time series. It clearly reveals a re-orientation. The
modiﬁed time series is shown as the dotted line. The dis-
placements along both the time and the θ0 axis during
the re-orientation have been removed by shifts parallel to
the axes.

One sees that omitting the re-orientations still yields data
consistent with Eq. 2 (solid line in the ﬁgure), but that
the diﬀusivity Dθ is about a factor of two smaller when
the re-orientations are omitted. The new analysis yielded
the results for Dθ shown in Fig. 4b. They can be repre-

C. Preferred orientation of the LSC

Over the course of this work, the entire apparatus was
rotated through several diﬀerent angles γ. We measured
γ as a clockwise angle when viewed from above in the
laboratory frame, with γ = 0 when θ = 0 was pointing
east. After each such reorientation the top plate of the
sample was carefully levelled to within 0.001 rad. A pair
of time series θ0(t) before and after one such rotation is
109 in the large sample. The
shown in Fig. 5 for R = 9
solid line corresponds to γ = 0 and the dotted one is for
γ = 0.97π. While there were many ﬂuctuations in θ0(t)
for both time series, one sees that for each run there was a
preferred orientation, and that this orientation shifted by
about π in the sample frame when the sample was rotated
by γ
π, suggesting that this preferred orientation was
due to an external ﬁeld ﬁxed in the laboratory frame and
not due to an asymmetry ﬁxed in the sample frame.

R = 9.4
and the ﬁtting function is not, this did not cause any
diﬃculties since we found that the width of the Gaussian
generally was much less than π. The only correction
needed was a shift of the values of θ by multiplies of 2π

In Fig. 6a the shift of θm [the peak of p(θ0)] after ro-
tating the apparatus is unmistakable. One can see that
it is only a little smaller than γ. However, at larger R,
the shift of p(θ0) was much smaller than γ. This is shown
1010, for the same γ = 0.97π.
in Fig. 6b for R = 9.4
The smaller shift suggests that the preferred orientation
at this R is chosen in part by some sample asymmetry
rather than exclusively by an external ﬁeld. This issue
will be discussed in detail in Sect. V.

The results for θm are shown in Fig. 7, in both the sam-
ple reference frame (a and c) and the laboratory reference
frame (b and d). One sees clearly for the large sample
in the sample frame (Fig. 7c) that the data for diﬀer-
ent angles γ approach each other at large R, indicating
that there is an asymmetry associated with the appara-
tus that dominates θm at large R. Comparing with the
vertical dotted line in Fig. 6 one sees that the preferred
angle in the sample frame at large R is close to the hot
side of the top plate. This will be discussed in detail in
Sect. V.

For the large sample in the laboratory frame (Fig. 7d),
we see that the data for diﬀerent γ nearly collapse at
small R, indicating that there is an asymmetry associated
with an external ﬁeld, ﬁxed in the laboratory frame, that
causes θm to align to the west. Similar trends can be
seen in the medium sample, but the data do not collapse
well, suggesting that the asymmetries are weaker or more
equally balanced there.

D. The instantaneous rotation rate of the LSC

the LSC to be presented in Sect. IV involves one free

IV. A MODEL FOR THE INFLUENCE OF THE
EARTH’S CORIOLIS FORCE ON THE LSC

A. Preferred orientation

The Earth’s Coriolis force can be shown to be responsi-
ble for the net rotation of the LSC, and to dominate the
preferred orientation for some parameter ranges. The
contribution of the Coriolis force to the ﬂuid acceleration
in the sample frame is given by

~r .

~u

−

(5)

Here ~u is the ﬂuid velocity, Ω is the Earth’s rotation
rate of one revolution per day, and ˙θ0 = dθ0/dt is the
azimuthal rotation rate of the LSC in the frame of the
sample. The sum ~Ω + d~θ0/dt is the total rotation rate
in an inertial frame. The centrifugal force is ignored be-
cause it is of 2nd order in Ω, which is a small parameter.
We shall take φ = 34.46◦, the angle of latitude at our
location, to be positive in the northern hemisphere. It
is natural to consider ~u = (ur, uθ, uz) in the cylindrical
coordinates of the sample.

Although the experimental data for the LSC orienta-
tion θ0 in Figs. 2 to 5 clearly show, on three diﬀerent
time scales, that this angle varies erratically in time, we
shall ignore the stochastic eﬀects for now as we derive the
deterministic eﬀects of the Coriolis force. If we assume
that the deterministic forces are independent of the time-
dependent stochastic forces, then the deterministic equa-
tions are equivalent to time-averaged equations. Start-
ing in Sect. IV D below we will consider the inﬂuence of
stochastic eﬀects, due to the turbulent background ﬂuc-
tuations, on the ﬂow.

For simplicity we model the LSC as having a square
vertical cross section and as consisting of four compo-
nents: two horizontal for ﬂow across the top and bottom
plates and two vertical near the side wall. The ﬂow is
taken to be horizontal and ﬂowing towards θ0 in a cone
based on the bottom plate and with its apex at the center
of the cell. It is in the opposite direction in a congruent
cone based at the top plate with its apex also at the cell
center. The horizontal ﬂow is assumed to have veloc-
ity uh = 2zU/L, where z is the axial coordinate mea-
sured from the center of the cell, and U is the velocity
at the peak of the proﬁle near the thin boundary layer
at z
L/2. The ﬂow in the remainder of the sample is
taken to be vertical with velocity uv = 2rU/L, and up-
ﬂowing at angles within
π/2 of θ0, and down-ﬂowing
at other angles [12]. The velocity scale U is much larger
than r ˙θ0, so we can safely ignore the rotational contribu-
tion to the ﬂow velocities here.

≃ ±

±

The horizontal components of the ﬂow are deﬂected
to the right in the northern hemisphere, so both the top
and bottom legs of the LSC are pushed into a clockwise
acceleration:

˙uθ,h(z) =

2uh(z)(Ω sin φ + ˙θ0)

¨θ0r .

(6)

−

−

8

We ignore forces in directions other than the azimuthal
because they will be balanced by the wall, although they
may contribute to some deformation of the LSC struc-
ture. For the vertical components, the upﬂow is deﬂected
to the west while downﬂow is deﬂected to the east in the
northern hemisphere. Since we deﬁned the LSC orienta-
tion so that there is upﬂow at θ0, the LSC will be pushed
to orient θ0 towards the west (θ = π) according to

We can combine Eqs. 6 and 7, taking an average of
the stated velocity proﬁles over the entire volume of the
sample to obtain the average azimuthal acceleration. At
this point we also introduce an adjustable parameter a
to be used as a ﬁtting coeﬃcient, and obtain

In doing this velocity average we assumed that u(r, θ, z)
is not correlated with ˙θ0 or sin θ0. The velocity average
led to the second and third terms being half as strong as
the ﬁrst because the horizontal ﬂow in the cone regions
takes up 1/3 of the volume of the sample, and thus a
volume half as large as that of the vertical ﬂow region.
The parameter a accounts for any other diﬀerences in the
ratio of vertical to horizontal ﬂow forces; if the model is
at all reasonable, then a ﬁt of its predictions to the data
should yield a value of a that is of order one. By dividing
by the spatially averaged radius
= L/3, and moving
the other ¨θ0 to the left side, we can now write a single
diﬀerential equation for θ0:

We resorted to doing spatial averages because the forcing
is not linear in r and thus there will be some distortion
of the LSC structure which we do not consider explicitly.
We derived ¨θ0 as a characteristic angular acceleration
representing the entire LSC.

The ﬁrst term in the bracket on the rhs of Eq. 9 ori-
ents the preferred orientation θm to the west, while the

data for θm at various azimuthal sample orientations γ
nearly collapse in the laboratory frame at small R in the
large sample, and θm is found to be slightly north of
west; so the model has successfully predicted the quad-
rant of θm. Equation 9 has two equilibrium solutions,
corresponding to ¨θ0 = ˙θ0 = 0, that yield θm. They sat-
isfy sin θm = (1/2a) tan φ, of which the value of θm in
the second quadrant (between north and west) satisﬁes
d¨θ0/dθ < 0 and thus is a stable equilibrium. However,
because of systematic uncertainties in the measurement
of θm as well as because of possible inﬂuences from sam-
ple imperfections that have not yet been included in the

model, we can not accurately obtain the value of a at this
point. In the absence of noise we would expect the LSC
to assume a uniquely deﬁned orientation given by θm.
We attribute the distribution of θ0 about θm shown by
the data in Fig. 6 to the action of the intense turbulent
background ﬂuctuations on the LSC.

B. Eﬀect of dissipation

While Eq. 9 provides a diﬀerential equation for θ0, it
does not take into account viscous drag, which we con-
sider here. We make the assumption that the dynamics
are strongly damped, so we can ignore the inertial term
(¨θ = 0). Then we can predict the steady state azimuthal
rotation rate ˙θ0(θ0) by assuming that the Coriolis force
is balanced by viscous drag in a boundary layer of width
λ. The average deceleration
of the LSC can be
estimated as the drag in the boundary layer times the
fractional volume of the boundary layer in the sample
given by λ/L for each plate and 4λ/L for the side for a
total of 6λ/L:

(12R
Eq. 11 we obtain a = A
e
We see that a is somewhat larger than unity, but not
excessively so given the many approximations made in
the model.
It is unclear which approximations would
lead to such an underestimation of the preferred orien-
tation forcing. The preferred orientation θm is given by
sin θm = B/A = 0.98π and is consistent with those ob-
tained from the peak of p(θ0) shown in Fig. 7 for small R
in the large sample. This conﬁrms that the θ0-dependent
forcing is responsible for the non-uniform p(θ0) in this
parameter range. This agreement is signiﬁcant because
there was no free parameter in Eq. 11 for determining θm
(A is determined mainly by the sinusoid amplitude and
has only a small eﬀect on θm). The ﬁt amplitude A vs.
R is shown in Fig. 8b, along with the model value for
A from Eq. 12 with a = 5.0, and with Re = 0.0345R1/2
which was found in other independent measurements [19]
for the range of R studied here. The large scatter around
the ﬁt can be qualitatively attributed to asymmetries of
the sample (see Sect. V). The scatter also prevents us
from accurately testing the R-dependence of the model
at this point.

We note that the line in Fig. 8b is nearly horizontal,
indicating a very small R dependence of the model. This
is because the denominator of A in Eq. 12 is dominated by

the constant term equal to 1; the term 12R
e
from 0.1 to 0.4 in the relevant range of R. Physically
this implies that drag is relatively unimportant in slowing
down the azimuthal rotation of the LSC, especially at
higher R. Thus the rotation rate is limited mainly by
˙θ,
the reduction of the Coriolis force in proportion to
i.e. by the rotation of the LSC itself in the retrograde
direction.

mine the preferred orientation, we ﬁt Eq. 11 to the data

×

Calculating the net rotation rate ΩR, the total num-
ber of revolutions per unit time ΩN , and the probability
distribution p(θ0) from the model is more complicated
because these properties are controlled by the turbulent
“noise” that causes the LSC orientation to meander. In
Sect. III B we reported that the orientation meanderings
have the diﬀusive quality that the root-mean-square ro-
tation rate ˙θrms
Dθ/(nδt), where
Dθ is a diﬀusion constant. We thus adopt the idea that θ0
carries out a diﬀusive motion, driven by the background
turbulence, in the potential created by the Coriolis force.

To calculate both p(θ0) and the net rotation rate for
an intermediate noise strength we follow the method of
Ambegaokar and Halperin who solved a mathematically
equivalent problem for the voltage across a Josephson

The probability distribution evolves in time according to
the sum of an advective and a diﬀusive probability cur-
rent. This equation is valid in the case of strong damping,
speciﬁcally where the diﬀusion velocity 3U D/4L >∼ 13Ω
is large compared to the mean drift velocity (less than
Ω sin φ), and the mean free path 4LD/3U
0.2 rad is
small compared to the distance between peaks of the po-
tential (2π rad). In the stationary state the left side of
Eq. 14 is equal to zero, and by integrating the right side
we obtain

can be conﬁrmed by integrating Eq. 15 once more over
the range from 0 to 2π and using the fact that p(θ0)
is normalized with periodic boundary conditions in this
reduced range. In other words the net rotation rate is
the balance of the advective and diﬀusive terms.

requiring any adjustable parameters. Sample asymme-
tries at larger R required the use of experimentally mea-
sured values for A(R) in place of Eq. 12 and a shift in θ0.
With these adjustments, similarly good agreement was
found at all R studied in both samples.

E. Net rotation rate

Equation 19 can be used to numerically calculate the
net rotation rate ωR. The experimental data for ωR are
shown in Fig. 10a (circles). The predictions from the
model with a = 5.0 in Eq. 12 and Dθ from Eq. 3 are
shown as well (lines). The agreement is less than per-
fect. Since the Coriolis force was apparently not the only
asymmetry contributing to the potential barrier V , we
also calculated ωR by substituting the measured values
of A(R) and Dθ(R)for Eq. 12 and obtained the triangles
in Fig. 10a. The agreement with the measurements (cir-

R by increasing L (and keeping ∆T constant) leads to
an increase in ωR with decreasing R in our parameter
range. Thus even though the theory predicts a cutoﬀ
R below which net rotation cannot practically be ob-
served, it does not explain the absence of net rotation in
our medium sample. The limit of the net rotation rate

calculated the rate of crossing a potential barrier for large
barriers. While in our case the diﬀusion constant Dθ is of
the same order as and sometimes larger than A, we can
still calculate the ratio ωN /ωR for these intermediately
sized potential barriers.

In our model θ0 diﬀuses in a washboard potential with
a series of minima. We would like to make use of the
Fokker-Planck equation for the non-equilibrium proba-
bility distribution pm(θ0) of the LSC trapped in the mth
potential well. While our system is not in the large-
potential-barrier limit of the Arrhenius-Kramers prob-
lem, the barriers are large enough to keep the LSC in a
single well on average for several hours (2π/ωN ) as can
be seen, for example, in Fig. 5. We claim that the barri-
ers are large enough so that pm(θ0) is nearly stationary
and the stationary Fokker-Planck equation (Eq. 15) is
a good approximation in this case. Since pm(θ0) is not
periodic, we can treat two potential barriers ∆V+ and
∆V− (which have diﬀerent sizes because of the net ro-
tation term B in the potential) separately to obtain the
rates ω± of transition from one potential minimum m to
an adjacent minimum m
. We rearrange Eq. 15 for a
stationary distribution, replacing p(θ0) with pm(θ0) and
ωR with ω± to obtain

We note that f (θ0) has the signiﬁcance of the Boltzmann
factor in the Kramers approach. We do not attempt to
evaluate pm(θ0) for small potential barriers because we
only need to evaluate the ratio ω+/ω−. Since pm(θ0)
represents a particle trapped near m, it is negligible near
. Now the numerator has the same magnitude in
m
cases and we can calculate the ratio of
both the + and
transition rates. Making use of Eqs. 17 and 13 to evaluate

We show the data for ωN in Fig. 10b in a similar man-
ner to the data for ωR. The model calculation for ωN

(lines) uses the value of ωR from Eq. 19, with A obtained
from Eq. 12. The model captures the general trends of
the data well. When the experimentally obtained A(R)
are used in place of Eq. 12 (triangles) there is excellent
agreement between the measured values of ωN and the
model predictions in both samples.

Since the potential tilting parameter B increases the
size of ∆V+ while equally decreasing the size of ∆V−, the
value of B has a negligible eﬀect on ωN . On the other
hand the diﬀerence betwene ∆V+ and ∆V− is responsible
for the net rotation, so B has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on ωR.
Since the model predicts the correct ωN for both samples,
the disagreement between the prediction of ωR and the
data in the medium sample suggests that the values of
B we used for the medium sample are suspect. As seen
from Eq. 12, the value of B is essentially independent
of experimental measurements. Thus the disagreement
for the medium sample does not imply a shortcoming
of the Fokker-Planck description but is an indication of
unexpected physics.

We note that the Kramers approach relies on the exis-
tence of (preferably large) potential barriers. According
to our model, the potential barriers disappear completely
when B > A, which is the case for the Earth’s Coriolis
force near the north or south pole, or for intentionally
rotating experiments. In these cases our calculation of
ωN would not apply.

Another experiment [24] similar to ours, at φ = 22◦,
5, 109 < R < 1010, and L = 19.5 cm,
Γ = 1, σ
found a clockwise net rotation at a rate that increased
with R, which we estimate as an average over all R rep-
resented in Fig. 4 of Ref. [24] to be ωR
0.4)Ω.
Although the runs were much shorter and thus the un-
certainties greater than ours, the net rotation rate re-
ported was larger than any found by us, even though
the measurements were in the range of R and L where
we found no signiﬁcant net rotation. More alarming is
that the magnitude of the rotation rate was larger than
Ω sin φ = 0.37Ω, the maximum allowed by the Coriolis
force at this latitude. Since the time series of the ori-
entations showed a strongly locked preferred orientation,
one would expect that the potential barriers would have
signiﬁcantly reduced ωR from the azimuthal drift rate,
as was the case in our experiment. We conclude that our
model is not consistent with the data of Ref. [24], and it
does not seem likely that any Coriolis-force-based model
could account for the large rotation rate observed in that
work.

An additional similar experiment from the same labo-
1010, σ = 5.3 but with aspect
ratory [25] at R = 5.3
ratio Γ = 0.5 was seen to have a much faster average net
rotation rate of ωR = +13.5Ω. This ﬂow was visualized
to show that there was a single LSC roll, so our model
should apply to that experiment with some minor mod-

iﬁcation. In this case the absolute rate of rotation was
very large, and the rotation was counter-clockwise when
viewed from above whereas a Coriolis-force model would
predict a much smaller rate in the clockwise direction for
any experiment in the northern hemisphere. These facts
suggest that it is not the Earth’s Coriolis force that is
responsible for the net rotation in that case.

We can compare the predictions of the model with
the results of Hart et. al. [14]. They deliberately ro-
tated their samples in the laboratory frame. Since their
axis of rotation was along the central vertical axis of
the cell and their rotation rate was much larger than
one revolution per day, eﬀectively φ = π/2 and the
Earth’s Coriolis force may be neglected. Since the ro-
tation rate was relatively fast, one would expect any
potential barriers to be less relevant, and in any case
those due to the Coriolis force vanish for φ = π/2.
Thus our calculation applicable to their system is that
of the azimuthal drift rate with sin(φ) = 1 which gives
ωN = ωR =
0.9Ω. The sign
of this prediction agrees with but the magnitude is larger
0.23Ω. Hart
than that of the experimental result ωR =
109,
et. al. did not see any net rotation below R = 9
which they achieved with a smaller sample about the
same size as our medium sample. This is in striking sim-
ilarity to our own observations, and suggests there is a
physical reason related either to the size of the sample or
to R that no net rotation was observed in these experi-
ments.

Hart et al. [14] also developed a model to explain their
results that is similar to ours in that the Coriolis force
was balanced by drag. In the limit of zero drag, called the
“inertial oscillation” model by Hart et al., both models
yield ωR =
Ω. Better agreement with the experiment
can be achieved for a dissipation level signiﬁcantly larger
than that provided by the viscous drag across a lami-
nar boundary layer assumed by us. Indeed Hart et al.
invoked an eﬀective turbulent viscosity and introduced
a greater level of dissipation into their model, thereby
achieving good agreement with their measurements of
ωR.

V. EFFECT OF AZIMUTHAL SAMPLE
ASYMMETRY ON THE PREFERRED
ORIENTATION

At large R we found a preferred orientation that was
locked in the sample reference frame (see Fig. 7) and thus
must have been due to some asymmetry of the apparatus.
We identiﬁed the top-plate cooling-system as the most
likely source. This system consisted of a channel in the
form of a double spiral with inlet and outlet at opposite
ends of a diameter. [17] As coolant traversed through the
channel, its temperature increased slightly as it absorbed
heat from the plate. This meant that the coolant was
coolest near the inlet and warmest near the outlet. We
conﬁrmed this by conducting separate experiments with

coolant ﬂowing in opposite directions. In both cases the
temperature monitored at ﬁve locations in the top plate
near the ﬂuid-solid interface showed that here was a small
lateral temperature gradient in the top plate that was
positive from the inlet to the outlet. In both cases the
preferred orientation θm at large R corresponded to the
warmer side of the plate.

The double-spiral design had been intended to pro-
vide a uniform temperature over the entire top plate be-
cause ideally the average temperature of adjacent chan-
nels should be the same everywhere. However, the ex-
perimental results suggest that this cancellation between
adjacent channels was not suﬃcient to prevent a biased
azimuthal orientation of the very sensitive LSC. We be-
lieve that the incomplete cancellation near the inlet and
outlet may be responsible for the problem. The cooling
of the top plate contrasts with the heating of the bottom
plate, where the same amount of heat is dissipated per
unit length along the entire length of the heater wire and
where the spacing between adjacent lengths of the wire
was smaller than that between the spiral channels.

×

×

In the remainder of this section we model the eﬀect
on the LSC orientation of a small horizontal tempera-
ture gradient in the top plate due to the cooling-system
geometry. First we focus on the horizontal temperature
diﬀerent δT in the top plate between two thermistors
a distance 3L/4 apart along a diameter nearly passing
through the inlet and outlet. The magnitude in the large
1010 was given approximately by
sample for R >∼ 2
10−8R0.57. A top-plate thermistor tem-
δT /∆T = 1.2
perature and the side-wall thermistor temperature below
it showed a positive correlation, with the top-plate tem-
perature leading the side-wall temperature, suggesting
that the top-plate temperature determined the LSC ori-
entation and not the other way around. For smaller R the
temperature gradient fell below the ﬁt and even became
slightly negative from the inlet to the outlet. At these R
the Coriolis force was shown to determine θm, and the top
plate happened to be aligned so that the cooling system
pushes the LSC in the opposite direction as the Corio-
lis force, so the temperature measurements suggest that
the LSC determined the top-plate temperature-proﬁle at
small R.

Next, to model the eﬀect of the top-plate asymmetry
on the LSC, we will assume that the top-plate temper-
ature varies linearly along a diameter so that its mag-

we see that the acceleration scales roughly as R1.24, com-
pared to the Coriolis-force acceleration from Eq. 9 which
scales as R0.5; so this explains why the Coriolis force de-
termines θm at small R but the cooling system determines
θm at large R. To ﬁnd the new preferred orientation, we
set the forcings given by Eq. 9 and Eq. 24 equal to each
other, setting ˙θ0 = 0, and inserting γ in the Coriolis-force
term to account for the diﬀerent apparatus orientations.

Here Rt is the transitional Rayleigh number where the
cooling-system asymmetry overtakes the Coriolis force
in determining θm. From the numbers given we calcu-
1010. We ﬁtted our data for θm vs.
late Rt ≃
R from the large sample for several apparatus orienta-
tions γ to Eq. 25. This ﬁt is shown in Fig. 11a and gave
1010 and θc = 0.26π. With these parameters,
Rt = 3
we also calculate θm vs. γ from the model for several
values of R. The results are shown in Fig. 11b for a
diﬀerent perspective on much of the same data as those
shown in Fig. 11a. The transitional Rayleigh number Rt
is predicted quite accurately for an order-of-magnitude
model. The large-R limit of the preferred orientation
θc is opposite the coldest top-plate thermistor, which is
the ﬁrst thermistor the ﬂuid passes in the cooling chan-
nel, so these data are consistent with the cooling sys-
tem being responsible for determining θm at large R in
our experiments. The cooling system orientation θc was
shown in Fig. 6b. In that ﬁgure, the background of p(θ0)
for the γ = 0 data is notably larger than for the other
p(θ0) shown, which can be explained by the fact that at
γ = 0, the Coriolis force and the top-plate asymmetry
are trying to force the LSC into two opposing preferred
orientations and the partial cancellation of these forces
results in a more uniform p(θ0). The variation of the po-
tential barrier A with R as shown in Fig. 8b can also be
explained qualitatively. Since the cooling-system forcing
and the Coriolis force oppose each other, the net eﬀect
is to reduce the net potential barrier at large R in the
large sample from the Coriolis force prediction. A hor-
izontal temperature gradient across the top plate from
the medium sample was also measured at large R to go
from the coolant outlet to the inlet. In this case the top
plate was placed with the inlet on the east side, so that
the cooling system forced the LSC in the same direction
as the Coriolis force. This can be seen to increase the po-
tential barrier A relative to the Coriolis force prediction
for the medium sample in Fig. 8b.

TABLE I: The values of the tilt angle β0 where the probability
distribution of various measured parameters (left column) had
a maximum for the large sample. Results are given at two
values of R. The preferred orientation at β = 0 is determined
by the Coriolis force at the smaller R, and by asymmetries of
the top-plate cooling-system at the larger R.

VI. CANCELLATION OF PREFERRED
ORIENTATION BY TILT

We can tilt the apparatus to an angle β relative to the
gravitational acceleration, deﬁned to be positive when
the usually cooler side of the top plate is raised so as
to add buoyancy to the boundary layers to oppose the
prevailing preferred orientation. At an appropriate angle
β0 > 0, we expect the eﬀects of the various asymmetries
to be cancelled out by the added buoyancy due to the
tilt. It would be a simple matter to combine the mod-
els presented above for the Coriolis force and cooling-
system force with the tilt model presented in Ref.
[16]
to estimate β0, but in the interest of brevity we show
only the experimental results. The probability distribu-
tion p(θ0) is shown for several small positive tilt angles
109 in the large sample. These
in Fig. 12 at R = 9.0
experiments were done at γ = 0, where the Coriolis force

×

and cooling-system asymmetries oppose each other, and
the Coriolis force dominates at the smaller R while the
cooling system dominates at the larger R. For larger
tilt angles p(θ0) is sharply peaked near the southeast
(θ0/2π = 0.875), which corresponds to the high side of
the tilted sample, as we would expect. At the interme-
diate tilt angle of β = 0.0035, we ﬁnd the most uni-
form p(θ0), suggesting a close balance between the initial
asymmetries of the sample and the buoyancy eﬀects due
to tilting. To get a precise value of β0, we ﬁt Eq. 4 to
p(θ0) to obtain the width σθ and background constant C.
Each ﬁtparameter x was then ﬁt to an empirical function
x(β) = x0+x1 exp(

value of β0 again representing the balance between tilt
and other asymmetric forces. Since β is deﬁned posi-
tive when the tilt-induced buoyancy opposes the prevail-
ing preferred orientation of the LSC, a positive value β0
means that the prevailing asymmetries aﬀect the mea-
1010, all of
sured parameter as expected. At R = 8.9
the values of β0 are positive, so the cooling system asym-
metry aﬀects all of the measured parameters. This is
reasonable because the tilt model and the cooling-system
model both assumed the mechanism of increased buoy-
109
ancy in the boundary layer. However, at R = 9.0
some of the values of β0 are negative, indicating that the
prevailing asymmetry, in this case the Coriolis force, does
not aﬀect those measured parameters as strongly as the
cooling system – which also opposes the Coriolis force
and thus enhanced the tilt eﬀect at this R – even though
the Coriolis force had a stronger eﬀect in determining θm
at this R. The values of β0 are smaller in magnitude for
the parameters relating to p(θ0) at both R because the
Coriolis force and cooling system asymmetries both apply
and oppose each other, so there is a partial cancellation
of forces.

These data from the tilting experiments further con-
ﬁrm that the Coriolis force does aﬀect p(θ0) and the local
azimuthal forcing
that is responsible for p(θ0), as
we had already shown by other methods, but they also
show that the Coriolis force does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect δ,
Re, ωr, or ˙θrms. Because the Coriolis force only deﬂects
moving ﬂuid and does not enhance or damp its speed, it is
entirely reasonable that it does not directly aﬀect Re and
δ. The other values, ωr and ˙θrms, are presumably due to
turbulence, but we do not know the detailed mechanisms.
We can not rule out the possibility of weaker, ”higher or-
der” couplings between the Coriolis force and the LSC.

amount equivalent to a tilt of β = 0.006 rad. We previ-

[16], so our results suggest that the cooling system has
the eﬀect of increasing Re by about 1% at this R. We
measured
as well, but our resolution of 0.1% is not
enough to measure such small diﬀerences. We have pre-
viously reported the sensitivity of
to tilt is a reduction
of only 3.1% per radian of tilt [16], so even if we expected
to ﬁnd β0 = 0.006 rad, that would imply a reduction in
of only 0.02%. However, we consider even this small

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We identiﬁed several interesting eﬀects of the Earth’s
Coriolis force and the turbulent background ﬂuctuations
on the large-scale circulation of turbulent Raleigh-B´enard
convection. There are clockwise and counter-clockwise
relatively sudden revolutions through 2π of the orienta-
tion of the LSC circulation plane. The clockwise ones are
slightly more frequent than the counter-clockwise ones,
leading to a net rotation with an average rate of less
than one rotation per day. There is a preferred value
and a distribution about it, sampled over time, of the
LSC orientation. Both the preferred value and the dis-
tribution can be understood quantitatively in terms of
the diﬀusive LSC meandering in the Coriolis-force po-
tential, driven by the turbulent ﬂuctuations. This model
agrees with experimental results extremely well for small
Rayleigh numbers in one of our samples, but at larger
R a small asymmetry of the experimental apparatus has
to be invoked to explain all the data. We gave a more
complete summary of our ﬁndings in the Introduction
and will not repeat this here.
Instead, we make a few
additional observations.

We used two samples: a “medium” one over the
108 <∼ R <∼ 1010 and a “large”
Rayleigh-number range 3
109 <∼ R <∼ 1011. We saw no net
one over the range 5
rotation in our medium sample, and one might wonder
why this was the case. We suspect that the reason may
be a change to a diﬀerent ﬂow structure with decreasing
R that responds diﬀerently to the Coriolis force. A dif-
ferent ﬂow structure is suggested based on images of the
LSC reported by Ref. [26]. Their experiments are done
with Γ = 1 and σ = 4, with images taken by particle im-
109 (which we can achieve
age velocimetry at R = 3.8
1010 (which we
in our medium sample) and R = 3.5
can achieve in our large sample). The LSC at the higher
R is more square in shape, ﬁlling out the container, while
the LSC at the smaller R more nearly has the shape of
an ellipse oriented with its long axis along a diagonal of a
vertical sample cross section. In the latter case there are
counter-rotating eddies at opposite corners of the sample.
Since these smaller eddies rotate in the direction opposite
the LSC, we would expect that the Coriolis force would
have the opposite eﬀect on them, which would partially
cancel out the net eﬀect on the LSC, and resulting in
less net rotation than otherwise expected. These eddies
would also be expected to reduce A and thus widen p(θ0)
and increase ωN , but since our model calculations used
the experimentally obtained A(R) this does have any im-
plications for the applicability of the Fokker-Planck de-
scription.

×

The calculation of p(θ0) and the frequency of revolu-
tions ωN from the Fokker-Planck equation, the Coriolis-
force potential, and the turbulence-driven diﬀusion is re-
markably accurate, which suggests that treating the LSC

meanderings as a diﬀusive process in a potential is an
excellent model for the system. However, this does not
completely describe the azimuthal dynamics of the LSC
because it does not account for other spectacular events,
in particular rotations and cessations. We found previ-
ously by numerical simulation that a diﬀusive model un-
derestimates the frequency of reorientations, even with-
out potential barriers [12]. Cessations of the LSC have a
duration of about one turnover time of the LSC, and rota-
tions have a duration of less than 10 turnover times [12].
The potential barriers identiﬁed are too weak to have a
signiﬁcant eﬀect over such short time scales. The fact
that Dθ, from time series with reorientations removed,
leads to an accurate calculation of ωN suggests the per-
haps surprising result that rotations and cessations do

with reorientations included, then we would have over-
estimated ωN by about a factor of two.

Studies of the asymmetry of our top-plate cooling-
system provided some useful information for future ex-
periments. While the LSC orientation and related dy-
namics have proven to be very sensitive to asymmetries
of the system in general, we have shown that several as-
pects of the LSC, including Re, δ, ˙θrms, and ωr, are not
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the Coriolis force, while they are
aﬀected by cooling-system asymmetries. In many stud-

16

ies, the latter group of properties is a more physically
interesting aspect of the LSC than p(θ0), so while the
Coriolis force may not aﬀect the results of these stud-
ies, a poorly designed cooling system will, particularly at
large R where the temperature gradients in the cooling
system become larger. The problem we had was a cool-
ing system in which the temperature drop of the coolant
as it ﬂowed through the cooling channel left an associ-
ated thermal imprint on the plate, which then aﬀected
the LSC temperature proﬁle. To minimize this eﬀect, the
temperature drop in the coolant – given by the ratio of
heat dissipated by the coolant to the total heat capacity
of the coolant – should be small compared to the LSC
temperature amplitude. Alternatively, the cooling sys-
tem should be designed with such a geometry that the
temperature drop of the coolant does not cause a hori-
zontal temperature gradient in the plate.

Abstract

We study eﬀective shear viscosity µ⋆ and eﬀective extensional viscosity λ⋆ of concentrated
non-colloidal suspensions of rigid spherical particles. The focus is on the spatially disordered
arrays, but periodic arrays are considered as well. We use recently developed discrete network
approximation techniques to obtain asymptotic formulas for µ⋆ and λ⋆ as the typical inter-
particle distance δ tends to zero, assuming that the ﬂuid ﬂow is governed by Stokes equations.
For disordered arrays, the volume fraction alone does not determine the eﬀective viscosity. Use
of the network approximation allows us to study the dependence of µ⋆ and λ⋆ on variable
distances between neighboring particles in such arrays.

Our analysis, carried out for a two-dimensional model, can be characterized as global because
it goes beyond the local analysis of ﬂow between two particles and takes into account hydro-
dynamical interactions in the entire particle array. Previously, asymptotic formulas for µ⋆ and
λ⋆ were obtained via asymptotic analysis of lubrication eﬀects in a single thin gap between two
closely spaced particles. The principal conclusion in the paper is that, in general, asymptotic
formulas for µ⋆ and λ⋆ obtained by global analysis are diﬀerent from the formulas obtained
from local analysis. In particular, we show that the leading term in the asymptotics of µ⋆ is of
lower order than suggested by the local analysis (weak blow up), while the order of the leading
term in the asymptotics of λ⋆ depends on the geometry of the particle array (either weak or
strong blow up). We obtain geometric conditions on a random particle array under which the
asymptotic order of λ⋆ coincides with the order of the local dissipation in a gap between two
neighboring particles, and show that these conditions are generic. We also provide an example
of a uniformly closely packed particle array for which the leading term in the asymptotics of λ⋆
degenerates (weak blow up).

Introduction

Concentrated suspensions are important in many industrial applications such as drilling, water-
coal slurries transport, food processing, cosmetics and ceramics manufacture. In nature, ﬂows of
concentrated suspensions appear as mud slides, lava ﬂows and soils liqueﬁed by the earthquake-
induced vibrations ([6], [7], [16]).

An asymptotic formula for the eﬀective viscosity of a suspension of non-colloidal particles in a
Newtonian ﬂuid, derived in [9], is based on the local lubrication analysis of the energy dissipation
rate in the narrow gap between a pair of nearly touching particles. The distance between two
neighboring particles in a periodic array is the small parameter in the problem. For periodic
arrays, this inter-particle distance is uniquely determined by the volume fraction of particles, so
that the asymptotics of the eﬀective viscosity is obtained as a function of the volume fraction φ
that is close to the maximal packing volume fraction φrcp. the asymptotics of the eﬀective viscosity
obtained in [9] has the form

Aǫ−

1 + O(ln ǫ),

as ǫ → 0, where ǫ = 1 − (φ/φrcp)1/3. The formulas for eﬀective viscosity of periodic suspensions
in the whole space R3 (without boundary) subject to a prescribed linear ﬂow, obtained in [11],
also rely on the local lubrication analysis. Asymptotic representations for the components of the
eﬀective viscosity tensor calculated by [11] are of the form

(1.1)

(1.2)

Aǫ−

1 + B ln ǫ + O(1),

Recently, concentrated random suspensions were investigated numerically by [14] using accelerated
Stokesian dynamics. It was observed that the behaviour of the eﬀective high frequency dynamic
shear viscosity of disordered suspensions can be accurately described by the asymptotic B ln ǫ,
indicating degeneration of the leading term in the asymptotic expansions (1.2) (weak blow up).
The authors of [14] also show that their results are in good agreement with available experimental
data ([15], [17]). This suggests that for generic random suspensions, the asymptotics of the eﬀective
viscosity deﬁned by the (properly normalized) global dissipation rate cannot be identiﬁed with the
local dissipation rate in a single gap.

In this paper, we use the discrete network approximation proposed in [4] to study the asymp-
totics of the shear eﬀective viscosity µ⋆ and the extensional eﬀective viscosity λ⋆ corresponding
to general disordered particle arrays. For such arrays, the volume fraction alone is not suﬃcient
for determining the eﬀective viscosity. Therefore, instead of ǫ, we use the inter-particle distance
parameter δ that controls the distances δij between neighboring particles.

The mathematical construction of [4] accounts for the long range hydrodynamical interactions
between the particles, and provides an algorithm for calculation of the eﬀective viscosity, which takes
into account variable distances between neighboring particles in non-periodic arrays. Furthermore,
in [4] it was observed that the leading term of the asymptotics may degenerate due to the external
boundary conditions and geometry of the particle array, while in the scalar case ([5]) the order of
the leading term is the same for all particle arrays that form a connected network. This paper is
devoted to a detailed study of this degeneration phenomenon. In particular, we clarify the issue of
weak versus strong blow up in the asymptotics of the eﬀective viscosity.

The deﬁnition of the eﬀective viscosity employed in this paper diﬀers from the deﬁnition in [11].
Their deﬁnition is closely related to the deﬁnition of the eﬀective material properties of periodic
media in homogenization theory (see e.g. [3], [10]), where these properties are deﬁned via analysis

2

on a periodicity cell. Then these properties are determined by the properties of constituents and
geometry of the periodic array, independently of the external boundary conditions and applied
forces. Such properties are usually deﬁned in the limit when particle size tends to zero while the
number of particles approaches inﬁnity.

Our deﬁnition is more directly linked to the viscometric measurements that necessarily involve
boundary conditions. We assume that particles of a ﬁxed size are placed in a bounded domain
(apparatus), and the typical distance between the neighboring particles approaches zero. Thus,
the total volume fraction of particles approaches the maximal packing fraction. In this case the
eﬀective viscosity will be inﬂuenced not just by the inter-particle interactions but also by the forces
or velocities prescribed at the boundary of the apparatus. Since we work with linear models,
µ⋆ (λ⋆) are independent of the applied shear (extension) rate. However, we also show that the
asymptotic order of the eﬀective viscosities depends on the relation between the orientation of the
velocity prescribed at the boundary, shape of the boundary, and orientations of the line segments
connecting pairs of neighboring particles.

We present suﬃcient conditions for degeneration (weak blow up) and non-degeneration (strong
blow up) of the leading term. We show that µ⋆ always exhibits weak blow up, while local analysis
alone predicts strong blow up. We also show that the asymptotic order of λ⋆ depends on the
geometry of the particle array.
In the paper, we deﬁne a broad class of arrays of particles for
which the leading order term of λ⋆ does not degenerate. This situation is typical in the sense that
for a generic array µ⋆ and λ⋆ have vastly diﬀerent values, and their ratio depends on the inter-
particle distance, which indicates possible non-Newtonian behaviour of the eﬀective ﬂuid under the
imposed boundary conditions. We also give an example of a closely packed particle array for which
the leading term in the extensional viscosity degenerates.

2 Mathematical model

We consider a concentrated suspension of rigid, non-Brownian, neutrally buoyant particles in a
viscous incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid. In the two-dimensional model, the suspension occupies
a domain Ω which is a square of side length two centered at the origin. The boundary of Ω is
denoted by ∂Ω. The upper and lower sides of ∂Ω are denoted by ∂Ω+ = {x : x2 = 1} and
∂Ω− = {x : x2 = −1}, respectively. We also let e1, e2 denote the Cartesian basis vectors parallel
to the sides of ∂Ω. The particles Dj, j = 1, 2, . . . , N are modelled as rigid disks with centers xj,
placed in Ω. For simplicity, we consider the monodisperse case, so that all particles have radius a.
The part of Ω which is not occupied by particles is the ﬂuid domain, denoted by ΩF .

The ﬂuid at low Reynolds number is governed by Stokes equations

µ∆v − ∇P = 0,

div v = 0,

in ΩF .

(2.1)

where µ is the ﬂuid viscosity, v the velocity ﬁeld, and P is the pressure.

In this paper, we consider the external boundary conditions of the shear and extensional types.

The shear type boundary conditions are given by

γe1
−γe1

v =

(cid:26)

on ∂Ω+,
on ∂Ω−,

(2.2)

where γ is a constant shear rate.

3

In the case of extensional boundary conditions the velocity is prescribed as

ε(−e2 + x1e1)
ε(e2 + x1e1)

on ∂Ω+,
on ∂Ω−,

v =

(cid:26)

(2.3)

where ε is a constant extension rate. The two remaining (vertical) sides of ∂Ω are free surfaces,
where the zero traction condition is prescribed.

To deﬁne particle velocities, we ﬁrst recall that a rigid body moving in the plane deﬁned by

e1, e2 has a velocity vector of the form

vj(x) = Tj + ωje3 × (x − xj), x ∈ Dj,

(2.4)

where e3 is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane of motion. Therefore, if r = ae1 + be2, then
e3 × r = −be1 + ae2. Equation (2.4) shows that the velocity of a particle Dj, j = 1, 2, . . . , N is
completely determined by two parameters: a constant translational velocity vector Tj and a scalar
angular velocity ωj. Both Tj and ωj are unknown and must be determined in the course of solving
the problem.

Since each rigid disk is in equilibrium, the total force and torque exerted on Dj by the ﬂuid

must be zero, which provides the boundary conditions on the particle boundaries ∂Dj:

Snj ds = 0 and

nj × Sn(j) ds = 0, for j = 1, 2 . . . N, ,

where nj is the exterior unit normal to ∂Dj, and

the superscript T stands for the transposed tensor, and I denotes the unit tensor.

Since the ﬂuid velocity v is the minimizer of the variational principle (2.8)-(2.9), the energy dissi-

3 Eﬀective shear and extensional viscosities.

3.1 Eﬀective dissipation rates

We suppose that the suspension can be modelled on a macroscale by a single phase viscous ﬂuid,
called an eﬀective ﬂuid. The velocity ﬁeld of the eﬀective ﬂuid is denoted by v0. The eﬀective ﬂuid
is subject to the same external boundary conditions as the ﬂow of the suspension.

We assume that the eﬀective stress tensor S0 satisﬁes the constitutive equation of the form

S0 = F (e(v0)),

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

where F is a symmetric tensor function that does not depend explicitly on x. In this paper, we
do not derive or postulate the precise from of the constitutive law for the eﬀective ﬂuid. Instead,
we use the fundamental principle (going back to [8]), that viscous energy dissipation rate of the
suspension must be equal to the dissipation rate of the eﬀective homogeneous ﬂuid. The dissipation
rates are deﬁned by

in the suspension, and

E =

S · e(v)dx = 2µ

E0 =

S0 · e(v0)dx,

ZΩ

in the eﬀective ﬂuid. In the equations (3.2), (3.3), S · e = Sijeij is the inner product of tensors.

For small particle volume fractions, ([8], [1]), this principle was further combined with the
assumption that the eﬀective ﬂuid is Newtonian with a constant eﬀective viscosity. However, for
concentrated suspensions this assumption is not validated by rigorous mathematical derivation or
experimental data and at present the problem of ﬁnding the eﬀective constitutive law for such
[15], [17]) suggest that
suspensions is still under investigation. Some experimental studies (e.g.
the eﬀective ﬂuid may be non-Newtonian. Our calculations of the eﬀective viscosity suggest that
non-Newtonian behavior is possible for irregular (non-periodic or random) suspensions.

We use the rheological deﬁnitions of shear and extensional viscosities as ratios of the corre-
sponding components of the stress and strain rate tensors. To calculate the asymptotics of the
two viscosities, we employ the network approximation introduced in ([4]). We analyze the network
functional (discrete dissipation rate) introduced in [4] and show that the standard relation between
two viscosities which holds for Newtonian ﬂuids (see [13] ch. 9 for the 3D-case and Appendix A for
2D-case ) does not hold.

3.2 Shear viscosity

Suppose that a homogeneous eﬀective ﬂuid undergoes a steady shear ﬂow with the shear rate γ. The
velocity ﬁeld vsh satisﬁes the shear type boundary conditions (2.2). The eﬀective shear viscosity is
deﬁned by (see (A.3))

our deﬁnition of F 0 in (3.1) implies that S0 is constant when e(v0) is constant. Since E = E0, the

Thus the calculation of µ⋆ amounts to evaluation of the total dissipation rate integral

where vsh solves (2.1)-(2.5).

3.3 Extensional viscosity

A steady extensional ﬂow of the eﬀective ﬂuid is characterized by a constant extension rate ε. The
velocity v0
ext satisﬁes the extensional boundary conditions (2.3). The extensional viscosity (see, e.g.
[13]. ch.9) may be deﬁned by

and calculation of λ⋆ again reduces to evaluation of the total dissipation rate (3.6) with vsh replaced
by vext . In the remaining part of the paper we derive asymptotic formulas for the total dissipation
rate under boundary conditions (2.2) and (2.3).

4 The Network

Let us consider an arbitrary distribution of circular particles (disks) Di, whose centers are points
xi in Ω, for i = 1, 2, . . . , N . We suppose that N is close to Nmax, so that neighboring particles
can be close to touching one another. The network consists of vertices xi and edges. The edges
connect only vertices that correspond to “ neighboring “ particles. Note that while for a periodic
array the notion of a neighboring vertex (particle) is obvious, for non-periodic (e.g. random) arrays
of particles it is not immediate. We introduce it via a Voronoi tessellation, which is a partition of a
plane (or a planar domain) into the union of convex polygons Vi, called Voronoi cells, corresponding
to the set of vertices xi. A Voronoi cell Vi consists of all points in the plane which are closer to xi
than to any other vertex xj, j 6= i.

The edges of Vi can lie either on ∂Ω or in the interior of Ω. On each face of Vi, that lies inside

Ω, | x − xi |=| x − xj |, for some i 6= j.

Deﬁnition 4.1 For each i = 1, 2 . . . N , deﬁne the index set Ni by

Ni = {j ∈ {1, 2 . . . , N }, j 6= i, such that Vi and Vj have a common edge} .

We call a particle Dj a neighbor of Di if j belongs to Ni that is the vertices xi and xj have a
common edge in the Voronoi tessellation.

6

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

Note, that according to this deﬁnition, two particles are not neighbors if their Voronoi cells have a
common vertex but do not share an edge.

The minimal distance between neighboring particles Di and Dj is given by

We call δij inter-particle distances. If a disk Di is close to the external boundary ∂Ω, we deﬁne the
particle-boundary minimal distance δi by

To model the high concentration regime, we assume that δij and δi satisfy

δij =| xi − xj | −2a.

δi = dist(xi, ∂Ω) − a.

δij = δdij,

δi = δdi,

c ≤ dij ≤ 1,

c ≤ di ≤ 1,

where δ is a small parameter in the problem, and the scaled inter-particle distances dij, di satisfy

with a ﬁxed positive c independent of i, j.

Deﬁnition 4.2 The centers xi of the particles Di are called the interior vertices of the network
(graph) Γ, i = 1, 2 . . . N . The interior edges bij of the network connect neighboring vertices xi
and xj. If a Voronoi cell Vi has edges belonging to ∂Ω+
∂Ω−, the corresponding xi is called a
near-boundary vertex. Each near-boundary vertex xi is connected with ∂Ω± by an exterior
edge, which is a segment ˜bi perpendicular to ∂Ω±. This segment intersects ∂Ω± at an exterior
vertex denoted by ˜x(i).

S

Finally, the network (graph) Γ is the collection of all interior vertices, exterior vertices, and

all the edges connecting these vertices.

The set of indices of the near-boundary vertices will be denoted by I, that is i ∈ I if the vertex

xi is connected to ∂Ω. Also, we write i ∈ I +(I −) if xi is connected to ∂Ω+(∂Ω−).

Note that Γ is essentially the Delaunay graph dual to the Voronoi tessellation, and the above

notions admit straightforward generalization to three dimensions.

5 Network approximation of the eﬀective viscosity

5.1 Network equations

To deﬁne the network approximation, we ﬁrst assign a translational velocity Ti and an angular
velocity ωi of a particle Di to the corresponding interior vertex xi. At the exterior vertices ˜xi we
prescribe the velocity vector g which represents the boundary conditions (2.2) or (2.3).

For each pair of neighboring particles Di and Dj we introduce a gap Πij which represents a
ﬂuid region where lubrication eﬀects are very strong as shown on Fig.1. The width Rij of such
gap is independent of δ. For technical reasons it is convenient to work with non-intersecting gaps.
Since the maximal number of gaps adjacent to each particle is equal to the maximal coordination
number (number of neighbors), K, we can choose Rij = KM a, where M is suﬃciently small and
ﬁxed. The precise value of M is not essential for our purposes.

The orientation of each interior gap Πij relative to a disk Di is speciﬁed by a unit vector

qij =

xi − xj
|xi − xj|

.

(5.1)

We also let pij be the unit vector obtained by rotating qij clockwise by π/2 (see Fig.2).

Boundary edges and corresponding gaps are oriented perpendicular to e1. This reﬂects the
physical fact that the zone of the largest energy dissipation is located near the shortest line con-
necting xi with the boundary. Therefore, qi = e2, (respectively −e2), when Di is adjacent to ∂Ω+
(respectively ∂Ω−).

Next, to each edge of the network we associate a dissipation rate W ij (W i), calculated in the
corresponding gap Πij (Πi). The calculation of the dissipation rates employs lubrication approx-
imation in the gap. The velocity in the gap is decomposed into three velocities, representing the
”elementary” motions called spring motion, shear, and rotation (see Fig. 3). The total velocity ﬁeld
in a gap is the sum of these elementary velocities and a ”residual” velocity ﬁeld, whose contribution

to the gap dissipation rate is O(1) as δ → 0. Lubrication approximations for each of the elementary
velocities and estimates for the residual are obtained in [4] where more details can be found.

Using approximations of the elementary velocities to calculate (up to the terms of order O(1)

as δ → 0) the dissipation rates in each gap we obtain

Equations (5.8) and (5.13) are, respectively, the equations of force and torque balance of the
particles, and the minimization in (5.5) ensures that the rigid body translational and angular
velocities are chosen in such a way that the suspension is in mechanical equilibrium. Note also
that (5.8) is a system of 2N equations, and (5.13) is a system of N equations. Together they form
3N equations for 3N unknowns (Ti, ωi). The coeﬃcients and right hand side of (5.8) are of order

To the leading order in δ, the eﬀective viscosity is determined by the discrete dissipation rate

Q. Thus the qualitative behaviour of the eﬀective viscosity is
δ−
determined by solving (5.26). We now sketch the issues which arise in computing the leading term
of the eﬀective viscosity. First, in the case of shear viscosity, f = 0, which means that the shear
boundary conditions do not contribute to the strong blow up. This results in the weak blow up of µ⋆
(see section 6). In case of extensional conditions, f 6= 0, which means that the right hand side of the

term is impeded by the fact that the matrix A is not invertible.
Indeed, from (5.16) it is clear
Q does not change when all vectors Ti, i = 1, 2, . . . , N are replaced by Ti + te1
that the value of
(horizontal translation by te1, t arbitrary real). This is not surprising, because the functional

is invariant under horizontal translation of Ti. The invariance is due to the vertical orientation
of the boundary gaps explained in section 5.1. Note that this is not equivalent to translation of a
coordinate system, since g is not changed. Translational invariance of
Q implies that any z∗ that
solves the non-homogeneous system (5.26) produces other solutions of the form z∗ + tw0, where t
is arbitrary real, and

b

This means that vectors of the form tw0 solve the homogeneous system

w0 = (1, 0, 1, 0, . . . , 1, 0)T .

Az = 0.

(5.28)

(5.29)

Because of the above mentioned invariance of the functional
Q, the leading term in the asymptotics
of eﬀective viscosity will be uniquely deﬁned, unless (5.29) has some other nontrivial solutions.
Therefore, it makes sense to look for conditions on the network which would guarantee that every
solution of the homogeneous system is of the form tw0. Then the non-homogeneous system (5.26)
would be uniquely solvable up to horizontal translation. In Section 7.3 we show that for a typical
random distribution of particles this is indeed the case.

b

The last issue concerns the validity of the estimate (5.21). The functional

Q is non-negative,
but it may be zero. When (5.21) holds, local lubrication analysis provides the correct order of the
3/2 in dimension two and
leading term in the asymptotics of the extensional eﬀective viscosity (δ−
δ−

1 in dimension three). If (5.21) does not hold, that is,

b

Q = 0,

(5.30)

then the leading term in dimension two is of order δ−

b

1/2, (ln(1/δ) in dimension three).

Whether or not the estimate (5.21) holds, depends on the geometry of the particle array as well
as the boundary conditions on ∂Ω+ and ∂Ω−. In section 7.4 we show that in the case of extensional
boundary conditions, (5.21) holds for generic arrays, and thus the leading term in the asymptotic
3/2. However, there exist

and δ−

is therefore in agreement with the three-dimensional results in [14], up to the diﬀerence in the

The decrease in the asymptotic order of µ⋆ is a global phenomenon, which shows that the
local analysis could be misleading, and analysis of the entire particle array leads to qualitatively
1 in three
diﬀerent results. This fact can be explained as follows. The ”strong” blow up rate (δ−
3/2 in two dimensions) is obtained using classical lubrication techniques applied
dimensions and δ−

of δ. However, the network analysis of the ensemble of particles, interacting with each other and
with the external boundary, shows that the above velocities may depend on δ.
In the case of
shear boundary conditions, the right hand side of the network equations (5.8), (5.13) is of order
3/2. The solution of the network
δ−
equations is thus small (of order δ) which makes local and global dissipation rates small.

When the boundary conditions are given by (2.2), the vectors Ri in (5.24) are zero (since

Hence, if (7.10) does not have solutions, (5.21) must hold. Also, it should be noted that if the
estimate (5.21) holds for some subgraph of the network, then it also holds for the whole network.
This observation can be used to reduce the network to a simpler graph, for which it is easier to
prove (5.21).

7.3.1 Deﬁnition of quasi-triangulated graphs. Solvability of the system (5.26)

The network Γ partitions Ω into a a disjoint union of convex polygons, which are called Delaunay
cells. When points xj are distributed randomly in Ω, the interior Delaunay cells are typically
triangles. This simple but important fact can be explained as follows. The edges of Voronoi
tessellation are perpendicular bisectors of the edges of Delaunay cells. If an interior Delaunay cell
is, for instance, a quadrilateral, then any two vertices lying on a diagonal cannot be neighbors, and
therefore the point of intersection of four edges of the Voronoi tessellation must be equidistant from
the four vertices. This means that a convex quadrilateral may be a Delaunay cell only if all four
vertices lie on a circle. When the vertices of the network are randomly placed, the likelihood of four
(or more) points lying on the same circle is small. It is natural to call such cells the defect cells.
Therefore, most of the interior Delaunay cells of a random network are triangles. Other polygonal
cells (quadrilateral, pentagonal etc.) are typically small in number, isolated and are likely to be
unstable in the actual ﬂow.

Since the exterior edges of the network are vertical, the cells adjacent to the boundary are

typically quadrilateral. An example of a generic network is shown on Fig. 8.

Next, we deﬁne a broad class of graphs containing generic Delaunay-type networks. The graphs
in this class are called quasi-triangulated, because of the presence of triangular cells. The number
of triangular cells may be relatively small, as indicated by the examples below. We show that
for quasi-triangulated graphs the leading term in the asymptotics can be eﬀectively computed by
minimizing the functional
Q, that is the minimum is unique and can be found by solving the linear
system (5.26). We also show that the crucial estimate (5.21) holds even for more general graphs

which contain a ”spanning” quasi-triangulated subgraph.

Given an arbitrary network graph Γ, we deﬁne its maximal quasi-triangulated subgraph ΓM by

the following iterative procedure.
Step 1. Consider interior vertices which are connected to ∂Ω− and call these vertices generation one
vertices. All interior edges connecting these vertices are generation one edges. Add all generation
one edges and vertices to the subgraph.
Step 2. Consider all remaining vertices which are connected to the vertices of the subgraph by at
least two non-collinear edges. These vertices and edges belong to generation two. Add them to the
subgraph. Note that the non-collinearity condition leads to formation of ”supportive triangles”.
Step 3. Repeat step 2 until no more vertices can be added.

If the maximal quasi-triangulated subgraph ΓM contains all interior vertices of Γ, we call the
graph Γ quasi-triangulated.
It turns out that for quasi-triangulated graphs the system (5.26) is
”almost uniquely” solvable, that is two solutions diﬀer by a vector of the form tw0, where w0 is
deﬁned by (5.28), and the value of the form Q for these solutions is the same.

Proposition 7.1 Suppose that the network graph Γ is quasi-triangulated. Then there is a unique
solution of the system (5.26), up to a horizontal translation.

This proposition is proved in Appendix B.

7.3.2 Examples of quasi-triangulated graphs

First we observe that a restriction to Ω of a periodic rectangular lattice is not quasi-triangulated.
By contrast, a periodic triangular lattice restricted to Ω is quasi-triangulated. (see Fig. 9).

In fact, if a network Γ is not periodic, but all of its interior Delaunay cells are triangles, then Γ
is quasi-triangulated. The converse is false (see an example in Fig. 11). This means that the quasi-
triangulation property is more general than triangulation property. In [4] we considered a class of
graphs containing a triangulated path (see Fig. 10). In Fig 11, we present two examples showing
that a quasi-triangulated graph need not contain a triangulated path. On the other hand, a graph
containing a triangulated path is not necessarily quasi-triangulated. However, when a triangulated

path exists, it must be contained in the maximal quasi-triangulated subgraph. Therefore, in this
case the maximal quasi-triangulated subgraph is spanning (”extends from top to bottom”). Below
in section 7.4.1 we show that this condition is suﬃcient for positivity of the minimum of

Q.

7.4.1 Quasi-triangulated subgraphs

For the rest of this section, we consider the steady ﬂow of the suspension corresponding to the
boundary conditions (7.5) with the extension rate ǫ = 1.

We shall say that a network is a percolating rigidity graph when the crucial estimate (5.21)
holds. In this subsection we show that quasi-triangulated graphs are percolating rigidity graphs.
Moreover, a graph has percolating rigidity even when it is not quasi-triangulated but contains a
spanning quasi-triangulated subgraph.

21

Proposition 7.2 Suppose that the boundary conditions are given by (7.5) and the network graph
Γ contains a spanning quasi-triangulated subgraph. Then Γ is a percolating rigidity graph. Con-
sequently, the extensional eﬀective viscosity λ⋆ of suspensions corresponding to such networks is
O(δ−

3/2).

The proof of this proposition is given in Appendix C.

7.4.2 Networks containing a vertical path. Periodic square networks

We now present another class of percolating rigidity graphs. Namely, these are graphs that contain
a path connecting ∂Ω+ and ∂Ω−, such that all edges in this path are oriented along e2-direction
(vertical). The simplest representative of this class of graphs is a periodic square lattice. A periodic
square graph does not contain a spanning quasi-triangulated subgraph (in this case ΓM is just a
path which consists of the vertices adjacent to ∂Ω−, see Fig. 9). However, the estimate (5.21) holds
for a periodic square graph such as the one shown on Fig. 9. This follows from the more general
criterion

Proposition 7.3 Suppose that a network graph Γ contains a path Γ± such that
i) it connects ∂Ω+ and ∂Ω−,
ii) all edges of Γ± are vertical.

Then Γ is a percolating rigidity graph.

As noted above, if a path Γ± has percolating rigidity, then the ”larger” graph Γ is also a
percolating rigidity graph. Therefore, we only need to show that a path of vertical edges has
Q corresponding to such path is positive-deﬁnite.
percolating rigidity, that is, the quadratic form
For simplicity, consider a path containing three vertices. The argument can be directly gener-

alized to an arbitrary number of vertices. As before, (5.21) will hold if the corresponding system
(7.10) has no solutions. The latter now has the form

(T1 − e2) · e2 = 0,
(T1 − T2) · e2 = 0,
(T2 − T3) · e2 = 0,
(T3 + e2) · e2 = 0,

(7.17)

Ti = ti+e2 i = 1, 2, 3. The last equation of (7.17) yields

T3 = t3e1,
Introduce new unknown vectors
T2 = t2e1, and then the second
where t3 is a scalar. Then from the third equation we obtain
T1 = t1e1, which contradicts the ﬁrst equation. The contradiction shows that the

system (7.17) has no solutions. The argument can be easily modiﬁed to show that if at least one
of the edges of a path is non-vertical, then this path does not have percolating rigidity.

Asymptotic formulas in [11] also predict strong blow up of the extensional viscosity for cubic lat-
tices. Thus our results are consistent with the results in [11]. We refer to section 8 for a more
detailed comparison.

Figure 12: A rotated rectangular lattice of 12 vertices.

7.5 Weak blow up

In this section we present an example of a particle array for which the leading term in the asymp-
totics of λ⋆ is zero. Roughly speaking, the array in question is a rectangular lattice rotated so that
none of its interior edges are vertical. Let k denote a unit vector non-collinear to either e1 or e2.
The interior edges of the rectangular network in Fig. 12 are either parallel or perpendicular to k,
while the prescribed boundary velocities are parallel to e2. This misalignment will lead to weak
blow up. To show that the system (7.10) is solvable, we ﬁrst consider a single path connecting ∂Ω+
and ∂Ω−. This path may be any of the three such paths in Fig. 12. The argument we use admits
a straightforward generalization to a network with an arbitrary number of vertices.

The system (7.10) written for the path has the form

For technical reasons it is convenient to introduce new unknowns u1 = T1 − e2, u12 = T1 − T2,
u23 = T2 − T3, u34 = T3 − T4. The relations between uij and Ti are

From the ﬁrst four equations of (7.18) we see that u1 = t1e1, and ui,i+1 = ti,i+1k⊥, i = 1, 2, 3,
where k⊥ denotes a unit vector orthogonal to k, and t1, ti,i+1 are scalars. The problems of solving
(7.18) is now reduced to ﬁnding t1, ti,i+1 such that the ﬁfth equation of (7.18) is satisﬁed. The ﬁfth
equation shows that

(T1 − e2) · e2 = 0,
(T1 − T2) · k = 0,
(T2 − T3) · k = 0,
(T3 − T4) · k = 0,
(T4 + e2) · e2 = 0,

T1 = u1 + 2e2,
T2 = u1 + 2e2 − u12,
T3 = u1 + 2e2 − u12 − u23,
T4 = u1 + 2e2 − u12 − u23 − u34.

T4 = t4e1 − e2,

23

(7.18)

(7.19)

(7.20)

where t4 is a scalar. Equating (7.20) and (7.19) we obtain the equation for t1, t12, t23, t34 and t4:

t4e1 = t1e1 + e2 − (t12 + t23 + t34)k⊥.

This yields two scalar equations

and

0 = 1 − (t12 + t23 + t34)k⊥ · e2,

t1 − t4 = (t12 + t23 + t34)k⊥ · e1.

The system of two equations (7.22),(7.23) for ﬁve unknowns has inﬁnitely many nontrivial solutions
as long as k⊥ · e2 6= 0 , that is, the interior edges of the path are non-vertical.

At the next step of construction, we consider the full lattice on Fig. 6 containing 12 vertices.
The interior edges of the graph are oriented either by the unit vector k as above (longitudinal edges),
or by k⊥ (latitudinal edges). We view the graph as the union of three paths of longitudinal edges
extending from ∂Ω− to ∂Ω+, with latitudinal edges connecting these paths. To obtain the desired
example, we choose the vectors Ti for one of the paths, as explained above. Then we prescribe the
same vectors to the corresponding vertices of two remaining paths. Now, if two neighbors xi , xj
belong to diﬀerent paths, then Ti = Tj, so the corresponding equation (Ti − Tj) · k⊥ = 0 of the
system (7.10) is satisﬁed. When the neighbors xi, xj belong to the same path, the corresponding
equation (Ti − Tj) · k = 0 is satisﬁed by the choice of Ti, Tj. Therefore, the whole system (7.10)
in this case has inﬁnitely many nontrivial solutions. Each of these solutions makes
Q, and thus the
leading term in the asymptotics of λ⋆, zero.

8 Comparison with some results for periodic cubic arrays in di-

mension three

The main objective of network approximation is to deﬁne eﬀective properties for non-periodic
deterministic or random arrays. While techniques of periodic homogenization are well developed
([3], [12], [10] and references therein), non-periodic geometries are much less understood. In the
end of this section, we compare our results applied in particular case of a periodic square array (in
dimension two) with the results of [11] obtained for cubic arrays in dimension three.

The eﬀective viscosity of an inﬁnite periodic suspension obtained in [11] is the fourth order tensor
µ⋆ (in this section we use the notation from from [11]). In an eﬀective ﬂow with the constant strain
rate γ, the eﬀective stress is

ij = 2µ⋆

where P is an eﬀective pressure. The authors of [11] obtained the following formula for the com-

where δijkl = 1 if all indices are equal, otherwise δijkl = 0. µ is the ﬂuid viscosity, and α, β are

Suppose that the imposed eﬀective ﬂow is a steady shear with the velocity v = (κx3, 0, 0)
(three-dimensional analogue of (A.1)), where κ > 0 is a constant shear rate. The components of
the corresponding strain rate tensor γ are γ13 = γ31 = κ > 0 and γij = 0 for other values of (i, j).
Then, using (8.4), we obtain from (8.1) that the only nonzero components of the eﬀective deviatoric
stress 2µ⋆γ are

(2µ⋆γ)13 = (2µ⋆γ)31 = 2µ(1 + β)κ.

Since α is not present in (8.7), the nonzero components of the deviatoric eﬀective stress are of
1 and thus the shear eﬀective viscosity calculated by the three-dimensional analogue of
order ln ǫ−
1 (weak blow up in dimension three). The weak blow up was not

where κ > 0 is a constant extension rate. The strain rate tensor is

1. Consequently, the

Although Noonan and Keller did not address the issue of weak versus strong blow up for the
eﬀective viscosity in [11], the formulas (8.5)- (8.10) are consistent with the results for square lattices
in Section 6 of this paper in the following sense. If a periodicity cell corresponding to a simple
cubic lattice is subjected to a uniform shear (extensional) ﬂow, then the straightforward calculation
presented above shows that the shear (extensional) eﬀective viscosity exhibits weak (strong) blow
up. However, for other lattice types such as BCC and FCC, formulas from [11] imply strong blow
up of both viscosities, while our approach leads to the weak blow up of the shear viscosity for all
two-dimensional lattices. Perhaps, this can be attributed to the fact that in [11] eﬀective viscosity

is deﬁned in a diﬀerent way, as explained in the introduction. In particular, our deﬁnition takes
into account boundary eﬀects which are known to be essential in rheological measurements ([17],
[15]). Considerations based on inﬁnite periodic lattices cannot capture these boundary eﬀects.
Futhermore, if our approach is applied to a rectangular periodic lattice in a rectangular domain
chosen so that lattice periodicity is preserved, then our results are consistent with [11].

9 Conclusions

We have studied properties of the network approximation of the shear eﬀective viscosity µ⋆ and
extensional eﬀective viscosity λ⋆ of two-dimensional ﬂows of concentrated suspensions with complex
geometry. The ﬂow domain was chosen to be a square, upper and lower sides of which represented
the physical ﬂow boundary, while the other two sides were assumed to be free surfaces.

A small inter-particle distance parameter δ was used to describe the high concentration regime
for particle arrays which are not necessarily periodic (i. g. random). In the recent paper [14] by
Sierou and Brady, the high frequency dynamic viscosity of concentrated suspensions (see [17]) was
calculated as a function of volume fraction φ by means of accelerated Stokesian dynamics simula-
tions. Numerical results indicate a singular behaviour of the eﬀective viscosity as φ approaches the
maximal close packing fraction φrcp. We quote here from ([14]): ”... The exact form of this singular
behaviour is not known. Results from lubrication theory for cubic lattices would suggest that the
singular form should consist both of 1/ǫ and ln ǫ, where ǫ = 1− (φ/φrcp)1/3, but the relative amount
of each term is unknown... As far as we are able to tell at this point, the ln ǫ behaviour accurately
describes the numerical data.”

When the volume fraction is (approximately) constant over the ﬂow region, ǫ ≈ δ. One of the
objectives of our investigation was to address the issue of the unexpectedly weak blow up in [14],
and determine the asymptotic order of the eﬀective viscosity coeﬃcients as δ → 0. Our analysis of
1/2)
the shear viscosity µ⋆, based on the discrete network approximation, showed that µ⋆ = O(δ−
as δ → 0, while the formal estimate based of the local lubrication analysis would give a higher rate
3/2). In dimension three, the corresponding rates, given by the network approximation, are,
O(δ−
1 (see [4]). Our analysis oﬀers an explanation of the weak blow up of the
respectively, ln δ and δ−
shear viscosity. This analysis is also consistent with the numerical simulations in [14] up to the
diﬀerence in the space dimension.

We also show that the asymptotic order of the extensional viscosity λ⋆ depends on the geometry
of the particle array. For generic disordered arrays the network partitions the domain into poly-
gons (Delaunay cells), most of which are triangles. We have showed that for these generic arrays
λ⋆ = O(δ−
3/2). The same asymptotic rate is obtained for a larger class of networks called quasi-
triangulated. In a quasi-triangulated network, the percentage of triangular cells may be relatively
small, but the subnetwork containing triangular cells must be spanning. Another class of networks
for which λ⋆ = O(δ−
3/2) consists of rectangular periodic arrays aligned with the boundary of the
ﬂow. More generally, the same rate is obtained for arrays containing a single spanning chain of
neighboring particles, perpendicular to the part of the boundary where the velocity is prescribed.
We show that in case of the strong blow up, the leading term in the asymptotics of λ⋆ can be
uniquely determined by solving a simpliﬁed linear system of the network equations, provided the
array is quasi-triangulated. The simpliﬁed system, obtained by neglecting rotational and pairwise
shear motions of particles, provides an eﬃcient computational tool for evaluating the dependence
of the eﬀective viscosity on the geometry of the particle array and external boundary conditions.

the extensional eﬀective viscosity can be of order δ−
in the case of a periodic rectangular lattice, with interior edges misaligned with the orientation of
the prescribed boundary data.

1).
Our results imply that the ratio of λ⋆ to µ⋆ for generic disordered particle arrays is O(δ−
By contrast, in a Newtonian ﬂuid this ratio depends only on the space dimension. Therefore, our
results indicate possible non-Newtonian behaviour of the eﬀective ﬂuid.

B Proof of Proposition 7.1

The proposition 7.1 will be proved if we prove the following

Proposition B.1 Suppose the network graph Γ is quasi-triangulated. Then every solution of the
homogeneous system (5.29) is of the form tw0 where t is arbitrary real and w0 is given by (5.28).

Proof. First note that (5.29) is Euler-Lagrange system for the functional

Clearly the minimum of Qhom is zero. Thus every solution of (5.29) is a minimizer of Qhom. On
the other hand, Qhom(T1, . . . TN ) = 0 if and only if the vectors Ti satisfy the system of equations

(Ti − Tj) · qij = 0,
Ti · qi = 0,

i = 1, 2 . . . N,
i ∈ I.

j ∈ Ni

Therefore, a vector z = (T1, . . . TN )T solves (5.29) if and only if Ti, i = 1, . . . , N solve (B.2). The
solvability of (B.2) will be directly linked to the geometric structure of the graph Γ. We begin by
observing that qi = ±e2. Thus the second set of equations in (B.2) yields

Ti = tie1, i ∈ I,

that is, Ti are horizontal for all boundary vertices. Next, consider boundary vertices xi, i ∈ I −
(these are vertices connected to ∂Ω−), and recall that they belong to a path Γ−, edges of which are
interior edges of Γ. Hence, if i1 ∈ I −, then there is at least one i2 ∈ I −, i2 6= i1 such that xi1 and
xi2 are connected by an interior edge bi1i2. Using the ﬁrst set of equations in (B.2) and (B.3) we
obtain

(Ti1 − Ti2) · qi1i2 = (ti1 − ti2)e1 · qi1i2 = 0.
(B.4)
Furthermore, bi1i2 is non-vertical, that is, qi1i2 · e1 6= 0, which yields ti1 = ti2. Since each xi, i ∈ I −
is connected to at least one other, we obtain

with the same scalar t.

Since the graph is quasi-triangulated, there exists an interior vertex xl1 ∈ Γ , xl1 /∈ Γ−,
connected to at least two vertices xi1, xi2, i1, i2 ∈ I − by non-collinear edges. Then, using the ﬁrst
set of equations in (B.2) we obtain

(B.2)

(B.3)

(B.6)

Ti = te1,

i ∈ I −,

(Tl1 − te1) · ql1,i1 = 0,
(Tl1 − te1) · ql1,i2 = 0.

28

Since ql1,i1 and ql1,i2 are linearly independent, (B.6) yields Tl1 = te1. Next, let G1 be the union of
Γ−, xl1 and all the edges which connect xl1 to Γ−. Using the deﬁnition of the quasi-triangulated
graph again, we ﬁnd a vertex xl2, not contained in G1, and connected to G1 by two non-collinear
edges. Repeating the argument following (B.6), we see that Tl2 = te1. Then we choose G2 to be
the union of G1, xl2 and all edges of Γ which connect them. Repeating the process we ﬁnd the
vertex xl3 and continue until we obtain

Ti = te1,

i = 1, . . . N

(B.7)

with the same scalar t. This means that every solution of (B.2) is of the form tw0. Since solution
spaces of (B.2) and (5.29) are the same, the proposition is proved.

The following discrete Korn inequality follows immediately from the Proposition B.1.

Corollary B.1 Suppose that Γ is quasi-triangulated. Let W ⊂ R2N be the one-dimensional sub-
space spanned by w0 from (5.28), and let W ⊥ denote the orthogonal complement of W in R2N .
Also, let Qhom and A be, respectively the quadratic form deﬁned in (B.1) and its matrix. Then
there is a constant C > 0 such that the Korn-type inequality

1
2

Az · z = Qhom(z) ≥ Cz · z

(B.8)

holds for all z ∈ W ⊥.

Another straightforward corollary is as follows.

Corollary B.2 Suppose that Γ is quasi-triangulated. Then the system

has a unique solution z ∈ W ⊥ provided f ⊥W .

Remark. The projection PW onto the subspace W is deﬁned by

Az = f

The vectors Ri in (5.24) satisfy (B.9), so that f in (5.27) with Ri deﬁned by (5.24) is orthogonal

to W . This gives the unique solvability of the network equations (5.26).

Corollary B.3 Suppose that Γ is quasi-triangulated. Then there is a unique z∗ ∈ W ⊥ such that
every solution of (5.26) is of the form z∗ + tw0, where tw0 ∈ W .

This means that solution of the network equations (5.26) is unique up to a horizontal translation.

Since the vectors qi are vertical, (C.2) yields

where ti is a constant. Recall that Γ contains a path Γ− which consists of all boundary vertices
connected to ∂Ω− and all interior edges connecting these vertices. Hence, each xi1, i1 ∈ I − has
a neighbor xi2, i2 ∈ I − and thus (ti1 − ti2)e1 · qi1i2 = 0 from (C.1). Since two boundary vertices
cannot be joined by a vertical edge, e1 · qi1i2 6= 0. This implies that all ti, i ∈ I − are equal, that is

where t is a constant. Next, consider the boundary path Γ−. By deﬁnition of Γ′ there is a vertex
xj1, j1 6∈ I − connected to the boundary vertices xi1, xi2, i1, i2 ∈ I − by non-collinear edges of Γ.
Then from (C.1) and (C.4) we have

( ˆTi − ˆTj) · qij = 0,

ˆTi · qi =

−2 when i ∈ I +
0 when i ∈ I −.

(

ˆTi = tie1,

i ∈ I −,

ˆTi = te1, i ∈ I −,

( ˆTj1 − te1) · qj1,i1 = 0,
( ˆTj1 − te1) · qj1,i2 = 0.

(C.1)

(C.2)

(C.3)

(C.4)

Since qj1,i1 and qj1,i2 are linearly independent, we obtain ˆTj1 = te1. Now this argument can be
used recursively. Next we choose G1 to be the union of vertices xi, i ∈ I −, xj1 and the edges of Γ′
which connect these vertices. Repeating the argument, we ﬁnd a vertex xj2 6∈ G1, connected to at
least two vertices of G1 by non-collinear edges, which yields ˆTj2 = te1, and so on, until we obtain
ˆTi = te1 for all vertices xi which belong to Γ′. By assumption, Γ′ contains at least one vertex
x+ ∈ I +. But then ˆT+ · q+ = −te1 · e2 = 0 which contradicts (C.2). This contradiction shows that
the system (C.1), (C.2) has no solutions.

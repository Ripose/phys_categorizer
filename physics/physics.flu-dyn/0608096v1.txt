GLOBAL WELL-POSEDNESS OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL VISCOUS AND
INVISCID SIMPLIFIED BARDINA TURBULENCE MODELS

YANPING CAO, EVELYN M. LUNASIN, AND EDRISS S. TITI

Abstract. In this paper we present analytical studies of three-dimensional viscous and inviscid simpli-
ﬁed Bardina turbulence models with periodic boundary conditions. The global existence and uniqueness
of weak solutions to the viscous model has already been established by Layton and Lewandowski. How-
ever, we prove here the global well-posedness of this model for weaker initial conditions. We also establish
an upper bound to the dimension of its global attractor and identify this dimension with the number
of degrees of freedom for this model. We show that the number of degrees of freedom of the long-time
dynamics of the solution is of the order of (L/ld)12/5, where L is the size of the periodic box and ld is
the dissipation length scale– believed and deﬁned to be the smallest length scale actively participating
in the dynamics of the ﬂow. This upper bound estimate is smaller than those established for Navier-
Stokes-α, Clark-α and Modiﬁed-Leray-α turbulence models which are of the order (L/ld)3. Finally, we
establish the global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the inviscid model. This result has
an important application in computational ﬂuid dynamics when the inviscid simpliﬁed Bardina model
is considered as a regularizing model of the three-dimensional Euler equations.

Let us denote by v(x, t) = (v1(x, t), v2(x, t), v3(x, t)) the velocity ﬁeld of an incompressible ﬂuid and

governs the dynamics of homogeneous incompressible ﬂuid ﬂows, where f (x) = (f1(x), f2(x), f3(x)) is
the body force assumed, for simplicity, to be time independent. The existing mathematical theory and
techniques are not yet suﬃcient to prove the global well-posedness of the 3D NSE. Researchers who are
investigating this question have incorporated the use of computers to analyze the dynamics of turbu-
lent ﬂows by studying the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of these equations. However, this is still
a prohibitively expensive task to perform even with the most technologically advanced state-of-the-art
computing resources. Tracking the pointwise ﬂow values by numerical simulation for large Reynolds
number is not only diﬃcult but also, in some cases, disputable due to sensitivity of numerical solutions
to perturbation errors in the data and the limitations of reliable numerical resolution. In many practical
applications, knowing the mean characteristics of the ﬂow by averaging techniques is suﬃcient. However,
averaging the nonlinear term in NSE leads to the well-known closure problem.

To be more precise, if ¯v denotes the ﬁltered/averaged velocity ﬁeld then the Reynolds averaged NSE
(RANS)

where

∂t¯v − ν∆¯v + ∇ · (v ⊗ v) = −∇¯p + ¯f ,

∇ · ¯v = 0,

∇ · (v ⊗ v) = ∇ · (¯v ⊗ ¯v) + ∇ · R(v, v),

R(v, v) = v ⊗ v − ¯v ⊗ ¯v

is not closed. The quantity R(v, v) is known as the Reynolds stress tensor. The RANS system of equa-
tions contains the unknown quantity ˜v = v − ¯v, which represents the ﬂuctuation around the ﬁltered
velocity ¯v. The equation in (23) is not closed because we cannot write it in terms of ¯v alone. The main
essence of turbulence modeling is to derive simpliﬁed, reliable and computationally realizable closure
models.

In 1980, Bardina et al.
tensor by

[3] suggested a particular closure model by approximating the Reynolds stress

R(v, v) ≈ ¯v ⊗ ¯v − ¯¯v ⊗ ¯¯v.
In [31], Layton and Lewandowski considered a simpler approximation of the Reynolds stress tensor, given
by

(4)

This is equivalent form to the approximation

R(v, v) ≈ ¯v ⊗ ¯v − ¯v ⊗ ¯v.

∇ · (v ⊗ v) ≈ ∇ · (¯v ⊗ ¯v).

Hence, Layton and Lewandowski studied the following sub-grid scale turbulence model:

(2)

(3)

(5)

(6)

(7)

wt − ν∆w + ∇ · (w ⊗ w) = −∇q + ¯f ,

∇ · w = 0,

w(x, 0) = ¯v0(x),

where they denoted (w, q), the approximation to (¯v, ¯p). In this paper we will call this particular model
the simpliﬁed Bardina model. Similar to the alpha models [6, 7, 8, 16, 10, 26], Layton and Lewandowski
[31] used the smoothing kernel associated with the Helmholtz operator (I − α2∆)−1. That is, if v
denotes the unﬁltered velocity and u denotes the smoothed ﬁltered velocity, then we have the relationship
v = u − α2∆u. For abstract mathematical study, one can deﬁne a more general smoothing kernels, which
gives a diﬀerent relationship between u and v (see, e.g., [4], [36]).
In this paper, we will keep the
same exact smoothing operator. There is a very important reason behind the choice of this particular
smoothing kernel in our mathematical studies. The reason can be traced back from the early study
of 3D Navier-Stokes-α (NS-α) turbulence model (also known as the viscous Camassa-Holm equations
(VCHE) and Lagrangian averaged Navier-Stokes-α (LANS-α) model ). The explicit analytical steady
state solutions to the NS-α model were found to compare successfully with empirical data for mean
velocity and Reynolds stresses for turbulent ﬂows in channels and pipes for wide range of Reynolds
numbers (see, e.g., [6, 7, 8]). It was, in fact, this important ﬁnding, which led the authors of [6, 7, 8] to
suggest that the 3D NS-α model be used as closure model for the Reynolds averaged equations (RANS).
Under this particular relationship v = u − α2∆u between u and v, the other alpha models reduced under
the channel and pipe symmetry yield exactly the same equations, up to a modiﬁed pressure, to the system
of equations for the NS-α model restricted to this symmetry. Hence, the explicit steady state solution
to these equations will match the experimental data as well. This is one important property shared by
all the alpha models. In particular, the simpliﬁed Bardina model enjoys this important property as well.

GLOBAL WELL-POSEDNESS OF SIMPLIFIED BARDINA TURBULENCE MODEL

3

A more detailed discussion of this will be presented in section 3. With this at hand, we can rewrite the
simpliﬁed Bardina model (7) as

∂tv − ν∆v + (u · ∇)u = −∇p + f,
∇ · u = ∇ · v = 0,
v = u − α2∆u,

u(x, 0) = uin(x)

(8)

u and v are periodic, with periodic box Ω = [0, 2πL]3

Notice that consistent with all the other alpha models, the above system is the Navier-Stokes system of
equations when α = 0, i.e. u = v. We have rewritten equation (7) in the particular form (8) in order
to coordinate its similarity with the family of alpha models [6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 23, 26]. In this form,
when compared to the other alpha sub-grid scale turbulence models, the main diﬀerence, namely in the
bilinear term, can be distinguished easily.

Moreover, we note that, in addition to the remarkable match, in the channels and pipes, of explicit
analytical steady state solutions of the alpha models to the experimental data the validity of the ﬁrst
alpha model, the NS-α model, as a subgrid scale turbulence model was also tested numerically in [9] and
[35]. In the numerical simulation of the 3D NS-α model, the authors of [9], [19], [20] and [35] showed that
the large scale (to be more speciﬁc, those scales of motion bigger than the length scale α) features of a
turbulent ﬂow is captured. Then, for scales of motion smaller than the length scale α, the energy spectra
decays faster in comparison to that of NSE. This numerical observation has been justiﬁed analytically
in [17]. In direct numerical simulation, the fast decay of the energy spectra for scales of motion smaller
than the supplied ﬁlter length represents reduced grid requirements in simulating a ﬂow. The numerical
study of [9] gives the same results. The same results hold as well in the study of the Leray-α model in
[10] and [19].

This paper is arranged as follows. In section 2 we ﬁx some notations and deﬁne the functional setting.
In section 3 we discuss in further details why we chose the particular smoothing kernel and justify the
use of the simpliﬁed Bardina model as a closure model to the RANS. In section 4 we will re-establish the
global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of equation (8) subject to periodic boundary conditions.
We will re-establish this result requiring a weaker initial condition than those required in [31]. In section
5 we also provide an upper bound to the dimension of its global attractor. We then relate this upper
bound to the number of degrees of freedom of the long-time dynamics of the solutions to this model. Our
results show that the number of degrees of freedom for this model is proportional to (L/ld)12/5. This
estimate is much smaller compared to those established for the 3D Clark-α [11], 3D NS-α model [16]
and the 3D Modiﬁed-Leray-α model [26] which are of the order (L/ld)3. The smaller estimate on the
number of degrees of freedom for the simpliﬁed Bardina model is expected since it has a milder nonlinear
term than the 3D Clark-α model, 3D NS-α model and the 3D Modiﬁed-Leray-α model. Notice, however,
that we have excluded the Leray-α model in our comparison above. For the Leray-α model, the estimate
for its number of degrees of freedom is of the order (L/ld)12/7 as shown in [10]. The power (12/7) is
smaller than the power (12/5) of our estimate on the simpliﬁed Bardina model even though we have
here a smoother nonlinear term u · ∇u compared to nonlinear term u · ∇v of the Leray-α. One reason
for this is that the energy dissipation length scale ld for the Leray-α model is diﬀerent from the ld of
the simpliﬁed Bardina, 3D NS-α, Clark-α and Modiﬁed Leray-α model. For the Leray-α model, the
dissipation length scale ld is based on the time average of the H 3− norm of u. On the other hand, the ld
of the simpliﬁed Bardina, 3D NS-α, Clark-α and Modiﬁed Leray-α model is based on the time average
of the H 2− norm of u. Recently, Holm and Gibbon [21] produced an interpretation of the dimension of
the global attractor in terms of the Reynolds number. This global interpretation can assist in making
across the broad comparison between the various alpha models. In particular, by following their work

4

Y. CAO, E. LUNASIN, AND E.S. TITI

one would be able to show that the dimension of the global attractor for the simpliﬁed Bardina model is
much smaller than that of the NS-α model, but larger than that of the Leray-α.

For completeness, in section 6 we also include in our study the energy spectra of the simpliﬁed Bardina
model. Although the dimension of the global attractor for the simpliﬁed Bardina model is smaller in
comparison to those established for the 3D NS-α model and the 3D Modiﬁed-Leray-α model, we found
that the spectral slopes for the energy spectra for the simpliﬁed Bardina model is the same to that of
3D Clark-α, 3D NS-α model and the 3D Modiﬁed-Leray-α established in [11, 16, 26] respectively.

In the last section we prove the global existence and uniqueness of the inviscid simpliﬁed Bardina
model. This result has important consequences in computational ﬂuid dynamics when the inviscid
simpliﬁed Bardina model is considered as a regularizing model of the 3D Euler equations. This is
because the inviscid simpliﬁed Bardina is globally well-posed model that approximates the 3D Euler
equations without adding any hyperviscous regularizing terms. In particular, we propose the inviscid
simpliﬁed Bardina model as a tool for testing claims about the formation of a ﬁnite time singularity in
the 3D Euler equations (see, e.g., [25], [28] and references therein).

2. Functional Setting and Preliminaries

Let Ω = [0, 2πL]3. The simpliﬁed Bardina turbulence model (8) of viscous incompressible ﬂows,

subject to periodic boundary condition, with basic domain Ω, is written in expanded form:

∂t(u − α2∆u) − ν∆(u − α2∆u) + (u · ∇)u = −∇p + f,

∇ · u = 0,

u(x, 0) = uin(x),

(9)

where, u represents the unknown “ﬁltered” ﬂuid velocity vector, and p is the unknown “ﬁltered” pressure
scalar; ν > 0 is the constant kinematic viscosity, α > 0 is a length scale parameter which represents the
width of the ﬁlter. The function f is a given body forcing assumed, for the simplicity of our presentation,
Ω f (x)dx = 0, and uin is the given initial velocity
to be time independent and with mean zero, that is
also assumed to have zero mean and hence the solutions u and v as well.
R
Next, we introduce some preliminary background material following the usual notation used in the

context of the mathematical theory of Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) (see, e.g., [13, 44, 45]).

(i) We denote by Lp and H m the usual Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, respectively. And we denote

by | · | and (·, ·) the L2−norm and L2−inner product, respectively.

(ii) Let F be the set of all vector trigonometric polynomials with periodic domain Ω. We then set

V =

φ ∈ F : ∇ · φ = 0 and

φ(x) dx = 0

.

(cid:26)

ZΩ

(cid:27)

We set H and V to be the closures of V in L2 and H 1, respectively. We also note that by Rellich
lemma (see, e.g., [1]) we have the V is compactly embedded in H.

(iii) We denote by Pσ : L2 → H the Helmholtz-Leray orthogonal projection operator, and by
A = −Pσ∆ the Stokes operator subject to periodic boundary condition with domain D(A) =
(H 2(Ω))3 ∩ V . We note that in the space-periodic case,

Au = −Pσ∆u = −∆u,

for all u ∈ D(A).

The operator A−1 is a self-adjoint positive deﬁnite compact operator from H into H.
(cf.
[13, 44]). We denote by 0 < L−2 = λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . . . . the eigenvalues of A, repeated according
to their multiplicities. It is well known that in three dimensions , the eigenvalues of the operator
A satisfy the Weyl’s type formula (see, e.g., [2, 13, 40, 45]) namely, there exists a dimensionless

(v) For w1, w2 ∈ V, we deﬁne the bilinear form

B(w1, w2) = Pσ((w1 · ∇)w2).

In the following lemma, we will list certain relevant inequalities and properties of B (see [13, 44]).

Lemma 1. The bilinear form B deﬁned in (13) satisﬁes the following:

(i) B can be extended as a continuous map B : V × V → V ′, where V ′ is the dual space of V . In
particular, for every w1, w2, w3 ∈ V , the bilinear form B satisﬁes the following inequalities:

| hB(w1, w2), w3iV ′ | ≤ c|w1|1/2kw1k1/2kw2kkw3k,

| hB(w1, w2), w3iV ′ | ≤ ckw1kkw2k|w3|1/2kw3k1/2.

Moreover, for every w1, w2, w3 ∈ V , we have

hB(w1, w2), w3iV ′ = − hB(w1, w3), w2iV ′ .

And in particular,

(ii) For w1 ∈ V and w3 ∈ D(A), we have

hB(w1, w2), w2iV ′ = 0.

| h(B(w1, w1), w3)V ′i | = |
where D(A)′ is the dual space of D(A).

As we mentioned earlier, one important characteristic shared by all the alpha models is the particular
kernel used to give the relation between the smoothed velocity u and unsmoothed velocity v. This par-
ticular choice of smoothing kernel gives the important result that under the pipe and channel symmetry,
the reduced equation of all the other alpha models takes the form of the reduced of NS-α under the
same symmetry, up to modiﬁed pressure. As a result, the explicit analytical steady state solutions to
these equations will resemble the explicit analytical steady state solutions of the NS-α. In this way, the
excellent match of explicit analytical steady state solutions of NS-α to experimental data in the channel
and pipe symmetry for wide range of Reynolds number ([6, 7, 8]) is also inherited by these models. In
this section, we consider the simpliﬁed Bardina model as a closure to the stationary Reynolds averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. We will show that the reduction of the system of equations in (9) or
(8) in the inﬁnite channels and pipes are the same (up to modiﬁed pressure) as the system of equations
obtained in the case of NS-α (or the viscous Camassa-Holm equations (VCHE)), [6, 7, 8].
Let us begin by recalling the stationary RANS equations in channels and pipes (see, e.g., [38, 46]). We
establish some notations: for a given function φ(x, t) we denote by

assuming that such a limit exists (see, e.g., [18] for the generalization of the notion of limit to make
sense of inﬁnite time averages.) The long (inﬁnite) time average of the NSE, i.e. the stationary RANS
equations, are given by

(¯u · ∇)¯u = ν∆¯u − ∇¯p − (u − ¯u) · ∇(u − ¯u)

∇ · ¯u = 0.

This averaging process yields the well known closure problem. The system above is not closed since we
cannot express it solely in terms of ¯u alone. The main idea behind turbulence modeling is to produce an
approximate closed form for (23) in terms of ¯u alone.

3.1. The RANS equations for Turbulent Channel Flows. As might be expected from the visual
appearance of the ﬂow in experimental observations of turbulent Poiseuille ﬂows in inﬁnite channel (see,
T
e.g., [38, 46]), the mean velocity in (23) for turbulent channel ﬂows takes the form ¯u =
,
where ¯U (z) = ¯U (−z), with mean pressure ¯p = ¯P (x, y, z). Using this classical observation, the RANS
system (23) under such symmetry reduces to:

where the prime (′) denotes the derivative in the z-direction, and (u, v, w)T = u − ¯u is the ﬂuctuation of
(cid:10)
the velocity in the inﬁnite channel {(x, y, z) ∈ R, −d ≤ z ≤ d}. It is also observed from the experiments
(see, e.g. [38, 46]), that the Reynolds stresses hwui , hwvi and
are functions of the variable z alone.
At the boundary, it is natural to impose the conditions ¯U (±d) = 0 (no-slip) and ν ¯U ′(±d) = ∓τ0, where
τ0 is the boundary shear stress. Using the boundary conditions hwui (±d) = hwvi (±d) = 0, the Reynolds
equations imply that hwvi = 0 and ¯P = P0 − τ0x/d −

(z), with integration constant P0.

3.2. The Reduced Simpliﬁed Bardinal Model for Channel Flows. For any turbulence model if
an explicit analytical solution is available, then one can match this solution with the available physical
experimental data to test its validity. Here we will show that the reduced simpliﬁed Bardina model under
the channel symmetry admits the same exact equation as the reduced NS-α model. This is enough to
show that the numerical solution of the reduced simpliﬁed Bardina model in the channel will match the
experimental data for wide range of Reynolds number. For the simpliﬁed Bardina system of equations,
under the channel symmetry, we denote by U the velocity u in (9) and we seek its steady state solutions
in the form U = [U (z), 0, 0]T , with even reﬂection symmetry condition U (z) = U (−z), and boundary
condition U (±d) = 0. Under these conditions, the steady simpliﬁed Bardina equations reduces to:

−νV ′′ = −νU ′′ + να2U ′′′′ = −∂xp
0 = −∂yp
0 = −∂zp

where V = U − α2U ′′ and p is a pressure function. Notice here that we need additional boundary condi-
tions to determine V . Such boundary conditions are not yet available based on physical considerations.
However, in this case, and under the symmetry of the channel, the missing boundary conditions come as
free parameters that will be determined through a tuning process with empirical data.

3.3. Identifying the Simpliﬁed Bardina Model with RANS - The Channel case. Following the
idea of [6, 7, 8] we identify the systems (24) and (25) with each other, which is the essence of our closure
assumption. We compare (24) and (25), and as a result, we identify the various counterparts as

for some constant p1. This identiﬁcation gives

and leaves

the same (up to modiﬁed pressure and possibly
) identiﬁcation that was derived when identifying
the NS-α model (VCHE) with the RANS equations in the channel symmetry in [6, 7, 8]. The same
identiﬁcation holds true in the case of the Leray-α model [10], the Clark-α model in [11] and the ML-α
model in [26]. Therefore, similar to the earlier alpha models, the general solution of simpliﬁed Bardina
and NS-α will be identical (up to a modiﬁed pressure) and in particular, the mean ﬂows in both cases
are the same functions. A similar result applies to turbulent pipe ﬂows following the same argument and
we will not include it here. For further details regarding the identiﬁcation of the equations under the
pipe symmetry, see [6, 7, 8, 26].

4. Existence and Uniqueness

In this section we will prove the global existence and continuous dependence on initial data, (in partic-
ular, the uniqueness of weak solution) of the system in (19). We will establish the estimates ﬁrst for the
ﬁnite dimensional Galerkin approximation scheme and then using the appropriate Aubin compactness
theorems (see for, e.g., [13, 44, 45]) we can pass to the limit. In this section, we ﬁx T > 0 to be arbitrarily
large.

function φ ∈ V and for every ǫ > 0, there exists a w ∈ D(A) such that kw − φk < ǫ/(M + 1), where
M = 2 supt∈[0,T ] kv(t)kV ′ . Thus for every φ ∈ V

| hv(t) − v(t0), φiV ′ | ≤ | hv(t) − v(t0), wiV ′ | + | hv(t) − v(t0), w − φiV ′ |.

The ﬁrst term goes to zero as t → t0 since w ∈ D(A). For the second term, we have

| hv(t) − v(t0), w − φiV ′ | ≤ kv(t) − v(t0)kV ′ kw − φk ≤ M kw − φk < ǫ.

Since ǫ > 0 is arbitrary, we conclude that hv(t) − v(t0), φiV ′ → 0, as t → t0, for all φ ∈ V . Hence,
v ∈ C([0, T ]; V ′) and in particular, u ∈ C([0, T ]; V ).

To summarize: we have established above the global existence of weak solution of the simpliﬁed Bardina
system by the standard Galerkin approximation scheme together with some useful a priori estimates.

Theorem 3. (Global existence and uniqueness) Let f ∈ H and uin ∈ V . Then for any T > 0, (19)
has a unique weak solution u in [0, T ].

To complete the proof of the theorem above, we are left to prove the uniqueness of weak solutions.

Uniqueness of Weak Solution. Next we will show the continuous dependence of the weak solutions
in the appropriate norm speciﬁed below, on the initial data, and in particular, the uniqueness of weak
solutions.

Let u and ¯u be any two weak solutions of (19) on the interval [0, T ], with initial values u(0) = uin ∈ V
and ¯u(0) = ¯uin ∈ V , respectively. Let us denote by v = (u + α2Au), ¯v = (¯u + α2A¯u), δu = u − ¯u, and
by δv = v − ¯v. Then from (19) we get:

By taking the D(A)′ action of (64) with δu,

kδu(t)k2 = 0, which implies that we have u(t) = ¯u(t), for all t ∈ [0, T ].

5. Global Attractors, Their Dimensions and Connection to Dissipation Length Scales

Now that we have established the global well-posedness to the simpliﬁed Bardina model, in this section
we will show the existence of global attractor A ⊂ V for the system (19), its ﬁnite Hausdorﬀ and fractal
dimensions, and the physical relevance of this ﬁnite dimension of global attractor to the concept of “ﬁnite
dimensionality” of turbulent ﬂows.

Following standard techniques, the method that we will use to estimate the dimension of the global

attractor stems from the following lemmas (see [13, 32, 45] and [16], respectively):
Lemma 4. (The Lieb-Thirring inequality). Let {ψj}N

To start the study of the ﬁnite dimensionality of the Hausdorﬀ and fractal dimensions of the global
attractor, ﬁrst we recall that, from the existence and uniqueness properties of the solutions to (19), we
get a semi-group of solution operators, denoted as {S(t)}t≥0, which associates, to each uin ∈ V , the
semi-ﬂow for time t ≥ 0 : S(t)uin = u(t). We are now ready state and prove the following theorem:

Theorem 6. There is a compact global attractor A ⊂ V , in terms of the solution u, for the system (19).
Moreover, we have an upper bound for the Hausdorﬀ and fractal dimension of the attractor A

Proof. The ﬁrst requirement to show the existence of the nonempty compact attractor is to show that
we have an absorbing ball in V and D(A) and that the semigroup {S(t)}t≥0 deﬁned above is compact
(see, e.g., [13, 22, 39, 42, 45]). This can be established from the previous a priori estimates. First, let
us show that there is an absorbing ball in V and D(A). By (34),(50), and the fact that |um(0)| ≤ |u(0)|
and kum(0)k ≤ ku(0)k we have, by passing to the limit with m → ∞,

|u(t)|2 + α2ku(t)k2 ≤ e−νλ1t(|u(0)|2 + α2ku(0)k2) +

(1 − e−νλ1t).

(72)

Choose t large enough such that e−νλ1t(|u(0)|2 + α2ku(0)k2) ≤

, then we have

|u(t)|2 + α2ku(t)k2 ≤ 2

Therefore, the system (9) has the ball BV (0) in V of radius RV as an absorbing ball in V.
Proving the existence of absorbing ball BD(A)(0) in D(A) is similar. By (45) and (46) we conclude that

lim sup
t→∞

(ku(t)k2 + α2|Au(t)|2) ≤ lim sup
t→∞

k2(t) =: R2

D(A) < ∞,

and therefore we have the ball BD(A)(0) in D(A) with radius RD(A) as an absorbing ball in D(A).

Now applying Rellich lemma [1] we have that S(t) : V → D(A) ⊂⊂ V , for t > 0, is a compact
semigroup from V to itself. What is left is to show that indeed we have a nonempty compact attractor.
V
Since S(t)BV (0) ⊂ BV (0), it follows that for each s > 0 the set Cs := ∪t≥sS(t)BV (0)
is nonempty and
compact in V . By monotonicity of Cs for s > 0, and by the ﬁnite intersection property of compact sets,
we see that

A =

[t≥s

is a nonempty compact set in V and indeed is the unique global attractor in V .

We are now ready to give an upper bound estimate to the Hausdorﬀ and fractal dimensions of the
global attractor. As mentioned above, we will use the trace formula (see, e.g., [12, 13, 45]) to establish
this estimate.

The ﬁrst step in this estimation is to do linearization about a solution. We note that in order to
apply the techniques in [12, 13, 16, 45], we need that the mapping S(t) : V → V is diﬀerentiable with
respect to initial data. Following similar ideas of energy estimates in the proof of uniqueness of weak
solutions in the previous section, one can show that S(t)uin is diﬀerentiable with respect to uin, when
uin ∈ A. Thus said, we linearize the viscous simpliﬁed Bardina model (19) about a solution u(t) (or
v(t) = u(t) + α2Au(t))

where δv is a perturbation satisfying (77) and is given by δv = δu + α2Aδu. With this relationship, δu
evolves according to the equation

δu + νAδu + (I + α2A)−1[B(δu, u) + B(u, δu)] = 0

δu(0) = δuin,

linearly independent vectors in V and let δuj(t) be the corresponding solutions of (78) with initial value

The interpretation of the upper bound estimate that we get for the Hausdorﬀ and fractal dimension of
the global attractor in terms of small scales is important in showing the ﬁnite dimensionality of ﬂows and
in particular in showing the numerical computability of the turbulence model. To do this, we interpret
the estimate for the attractor dimension in terms of the mean rate of energy dissipation of the simpliﬁed
Bardina model. Following [16] we deﬁne the corresponding mean rate of dissipation of “energy” for the
simpliﬁed Bardina model (see (29)) as

Identifying the dimension of global attractor with the number of degrees of freedom, we will show that
the number of degrees of freedom for the simpliﬁed Bardina model is bounded from above by a quantity
which scales like (L/α)12/5(L/ld)12/5.

Using this in (90) and recalling (96) we obtain the following estimate for the dimension of the global

model is:

6. Energy Spectra

Turbulent ﬂows are characterized by the presence of wide range of eddy sizes starting from the size
of the ﬂow domain, say 2πL in our case, to much smaller scales, which become progressively smaller
relative to 2πL as we increase the Reynolds number.
It is important to examine how the energy in
a turbulent ﬂow is distributed among these diﬀerent size eddies by considering the energy spectrum.
Following similar arguments to those presented in [15] and [17] (see also [10, 11, 18, 26]) we will study
in this section the energy spectra of the simpliﬁed Bardina model. We will obtain our results about the
decay of the energy spectrum for the ﬁltered velocity u following similar techniques as those in the NS-α
[17]. In particular, we observe that there are two diﬀerent power laws for the energy cascade. For wave
numbers k ≪ 1/α, we obtain the usual k−5/3 Kolmogorov power law. This implies that the large scale
statistics of the ﬂow, in particular for those eddies of size greater than the length scale α, are computed
consistent with the Kolmogorov theory for 3D turbulent ﬂows. On the other hand, for k ≫ 1/α, that is
for eddies smaller than the length scale α, we obtain a steeper power law. The steeper spectral slope for
wave numbers k ≫ 1/α implies a faster decay of energy in comparison to DNS, which suggests, in terms
of numerical simulation, a smaller resolution requirement in computing turbulent ﬂows. For this reason,
we suggest that the simpliﬁed Bardina model is a good candidate for a subgrid scale model of large eddy
simulation of turbulence. To start, we deﬁne some notations:

b(u, v, w) = (B(u, v), w),

There are three ﬂow regimes that we need to consider to analyze the energy spectra. These are the
ﬂow regimes where energy is produced, where energy cascades (i.e.
inertial range) and, where energy
dissipates and decays exponentially fast (i.e. dissipation range). We split the ﬂow into three parts
according to the three length scale ranges. Assume kf < k, where kf is the largest wavenumber involved

in the forcing term. Thus,

u = u<
v = v<

k + uk + u>

k .

The energy balance equation for the simpliﬁed Bardina model for an eddy of size k−1 is given by

where,

(vk, uk) + ν(−∆vk, uk) = Tk − T2k,

Tk := −b(u<

k , u<

k , uk) + b(uk + u>

k , uk + u>

k , u<

k ).

(99)

(100)

We can interpret Tk as representing the net amount of energy per unit time that is transferred into
wavenumbers larger than or equal to k. Similarly, T2k represents the net amount of energy per unit
time that is transferred into wavenumbers larger than or equal to 2k. From these deﬁnitions Tk − T2k
represents the net amount of energy per unit time that is transferred into wavenumbers between [k, 2k).
Taking an ensemble average (long time average) of (99) we get:

ν h(−∆vk, uk)i = hTki − hT2ki .

(101)

We deﬁne the energy of eddy of size 1/k as

Eα(k) = (1 + α2|k|2)

|ˆuj|2.

X|j|=k

This deﬁnition arose from the fact that we consider |u|2 + α2kuk2 as the “energy”, since this is the
conserved quantity in the simpliﬁed Bardina model equation (see section 7). Using this deﬁnition, we
can now rewrite the time-averaged energy transfer equation (101) as

νk3Eα(k) ∼ ν

k2Eα(k)dk ∼ hTki − hT2ki .

2k

k
Z

Thus as long as νk3Eα(k) << hTki (that is, hT2ki ≈ hTki, there is no leakage of energy due to dissipation),
the wavenumber k belongs to the inertial range. Similar to the other alpha subgrid scale models, it is
not known what is the correct averaged velocity of an eddy of length size k−1. That is, we do not know
a priori in these models the exact eddy turn over time of an eddy of size k−1. As we will see below, we
have a few candidates for such an averaged velocity. Namely,

law k(2n−13)/3, (n = 0, 1, 2) than the usual Kolmogorov k−5/3 power law, in the subrange kα ≫ 1. This
signiﬁes that the simpliﬁed Bardina model, like the other alpha models, is a good candidate subgrid scale
model of turbulence.

7. Global Existence and Uniqueness of the Inviscid Simplified Bardina Model

In this section, we will established the global existence and uniqueness of the inviscid simpliﬁed Bardina
model using the classical Picard iteration method. The inviscid simpliﬁed Bardina modle is equivalent
to the functional diﬀerential equation

(103)

(104)

dv
dt

+ B(u, u) = f,

v = u + α2Au,

v(0) = vin = uin + α2Auin,

where, for simplicity, we assumed f to be time independent.

Theorem 7. (Short time existence and uniqueness). Let vin ∈ V ′, and f ∈ V ′. There exists a
short time T∗(kvinkV ′) such that the equation (104) has a unique solution v ∈ C1 ([−T∗, T∗], V ′), that is,
u ∈ C1 ([−T∗, T∗], V ).

Proof. We will use the classical Picard iteration principle (see, e.g., [41]) to prove the short time existence
and uniqueness theorem. Namely, it is enough to show that the vector ﬁeld N (v) = f − B(u, u) is locally
Lipschitz in the Hilbert space V ′. From the classical theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations we consider
the equivalent equation for (104)

v(t) = vin −

B(u(s), u(s))ds + f t.

(105)

Notice that v ∈ V ′ implies that u ∈ V and thus by Lemma 1 B(u, u) ∈ V ′. As a result the equation
above makes sense in the space V ′. Let v1, v2 ∈ V ′, and consequently u1, u2 ∈ V . By (14) and Poincar´e

Here we used the fact that kvkV ′ is equivalent to kuk. Equation (107) implies that N (v) is locally Lips-
chitz continuous function in the Hilbert space V ′. By the classical theory of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions, the equation (105) has a unique ﬁxed point in a small interval [−T∗, T∗] and v ∈ C([−T∗, T∗], V ′)
(see, e.g., [41]). In particular, since B(u(s), u(s)) is a continuous function with values in V ′ and the forc-
ing f assumed to be time independent, equation (105) implies that the left hand side v(t) is diﬀerentiable
and

This implies the local-in-time existence and uniqueness of solution v ∈ C1 ([−T∗, T∗], V ′), and hence,
u ∈ C1 ([−T∗, T∗], V ), to the inviscid simpliﬁed Bardina model (104) or (108). We will next show that,
in fact, we have global existence. To show global existence to (104) or (108) it is enough to show that
on the maximal interval of existence, kv(t)kV ′ remains ﬁnite. Let [0, Tmax) be the maximal interval of
existence. If Tmax = +∞, then there is nothing to prove. Suppose, for the purpose of contradiction, that

We will derive a contradiction to the conclusion in (110).

Notice that on [0, Tmax), u ∈ C([0, Tmax), V ), hence we can take the action of (104) or (108) on u(t). We

This is a contradiction to the conclusion (110).

To summarize, we have established the proof to the following theorem:

Theorem 8. (Global existence and uniqueness) Let f ∈ V ′ and vin ∈ V ′. Then the system in
(104) has a unique solution v ∈ C1((−∞, ∞), V ′) ( or equivalently, u ∈ C1((−∞, ∞), V )).

We observe that the inviscid Bardina model, (104), is equivalent to the following modiﬁcation of the

3D Euler equations

−α2∆

∂u
∂t

∂u
∂t

+

+ (u · ∇)u + ∇p = f

∇ · u = 0
u(x, 0) = uin.

In particular, it is equal to the Euler equations when α = 0. Therefore, we propose the inviscid simpliﬁed
Bardina model as regularization of the 3D Euler equations that could be implemented in numerical
computations of three dimensional inviscid ﬂows. The analytical study of the regularity of the solutions
of the inviscid simpliﬁed Bardina model, and in particular the limit of its solutions, as α → 0, to the
solutions of the Euler equations will be reported in a forthcoming paper.

Inspired by the above model, (see also [27, 37]), we propose the following regularization of the 3D

Navier-Stokes equations

− ν∆u + (u · ∇)u + ∇p = f

∇ · u = 0
u(x, 0) = uin

subject to either periodic boundary condition or the no-slip Dirichlet boundary condition u|∂Ω = 0. In the
presence of physical boundaries the above regularization (120) of the Navier-Stokes equations is diﬀerent
in nature from the hyperviscosity regularization of Lions [33], or any of the other alpha regularization
models, because it does not require any additional boundary conditions.
It is also simpler than the
nonlinear viscosity model of Ladyzhenskaya [29, 30] and Smogarinsky [43]. We will study the analytical
and long-term properties of (120) in a forthcoming paper.

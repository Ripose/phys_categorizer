Abstract

This work is dedicated to the analysis of the delicate details of the ef-
fect of upstream velocity ﬂuctuations on the ﬂame propagation speed. The
investigation was carried out using the Sivashinsky model of cellularisation
of hydrodynamically unstable ﬂame fronts. We identiﬁed the perturbations
of the steadily propagating ﬂames which can be signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed over
ﬁnite periods of time. These perturbations were used to model the effect of
upstream velocity ﬂuctuations on the ﬂame front dynamics and to study a
possibility to control the ﬂame propagation speed.

Key words: hydrodynamic ﬂame instability, Sivashinsky equation, nonmodal am-
pliﬁcation, ﬂame-turbulence interaction

Introduction

Experiments show that cellularisation of ﬂames results in an increase of their prop-
agation speed. In order to understand and exploit this phenomenon, we study the
evolution of ﬂame fronts governed by the Sivashinsky equation

The equation without the force term was obtained in [1] as an asymptotic
mathematical model of cellularisation of ﬂames subject to the hydrodynamic ﬂame
instability. The force term was suggested in [2] in order to account for the effect of
the upstream turbulence on the ﬂame front. It is equal to the properly scaled turbu-
lent ﬂuctuations of the velocity ﬁeld of the unburned gas. In [3] and [4] equation
(1) was further reﬁned in order to include effects of the second order in γ. How-
ever, as mentioned in [4], this modiﬁcation can be compensated upon a Galilean
transformation combined with a nonsingular scaling. Thus, we have chosen to
remain within the ﬁrst order of accuracy in γ of the original Sivashinsky model
(1) as it should have the same qualitative properties as the more quantitatively
accurate one.

The asymptotically stable solutions to the Sivashinsky equation with f (x, t)
≡
0 corresponding to the steadily propagating cellular ﬂames do exist and are given

The steady coalescent pole solutions (2) with the maximum possible number
N = NL of the poles were found to be asymptotically, for t
, stable if the
wavelength of the perturbations does not exceed L, see [6]. However, in spite of
their asymptotic stability, there are perturbations of these solutions which can be
hugely ampliﬁed over ﬁnite intervals of time resulting in signiﬁcant transients, see

[7]. These perturbations are nonmodal, because they cannot be represented by the
single eigenmodes of the linearised Sivashinsky equation. In what follows we are
interested in solutions (2) with N = NL and retain the index L only. Also, in all
reported calculations γ = 0.8.

In this work we calculate the most ampliﬁable nonmodal perturbations to the
asymptotically stable cellular solutions of the Sivashinsky equation and use them
to investigate the response of the ﬂame front to forcing. In particular, we study the
effect of stochastic forcing or noise. The investigation of the effect of noise in the
Sivashinsky equation was carried out numerically and the observations were rein-
forced by the analytical analysis of an approximation to the linearised Sivashinsky
equation suggested in [8].

Graphs showing dependence of a few largest singular values of etAL versus
time are shown in Fig. 1. One may see that values of σ1,2(t) for large enough
t match the estimation of the largest possible ampliﬁcation of the perturbations
φ(x, t) obtained in [7] by a different method. An even more impressive observa-
tion is that the dimension of the subspace of the signiﬁcantly ampliﬁable pertur-
bations is very low. Perturbations of only two types can be ampliﬁed by about 106
times.

The initial conditions φ(x, 0), which would be the most ampliﬁed once by
t∗ = 100, 200, 300 and 103, i.e. ψα(x, t∗), are depicted in Fig. 2. The dominating
singular modes ψα(x, t) stabilize to some limiting functions for t > 300. For
example, their graphs for t = 500 and t = 103 are indistinguishable in Fig. 2.
However, they vary in time signiﬁcantly when t < 300 and for t = 200 the

associated ampliﬁcation σ1,2(200) is already about 103, though ψ1,2(x, 200) does
not coincide with neither ψ1,2(x, 103) nor ψ3,4(x, 103). Thus, the dependence of
ψα on time makes the dimension of the subspace of perturbations, which can be
ampliﬁed say about 103 times much higher than two in contrast to what could
be concluded from the graphs in Fig. 1. This illustrates the complicatedness of
studies of the effect of transient ampliﬁcation on short time scales t < 300.

Fourier components of ψ1(x, t∗) and ψ2(x, t∗) for t∗ = 103 are depicted in Fig.

3.

Evolution of the perturbations, which grow the most and is governed by the
nonlinear Sivashinsky equation, is illustrated in Fig. 4. All the proﬁles were
displaced vertically in order to compensate for steady propagation of ﬂames in
such a way that their spatial averages are equal to zero. Matching graphs of the
spatially averaged ﬂame propagation speed

The asymmetric singular mode ψ1(x, t∗) results in appearance of a small cusp
to the left or to the right from the trough of ΦL(x, 0) depending on the sign of
ε. After the cusp merges with the trough, the ﬂame proﬁle converges slowly to
ΦL(x + ∆x, t), where sign(ε)∆x > 0. For a positive ε = 10−3 the effect is

t = 100 (cyan), 200 (green), 300 (blue), and 103 (red).

The symmetric singular mode ψ2(x, t∗) produces two symmetric dents moving
towards the trough on both sides of the proﬁle if ε < 0, see Fig. 4(b). By t
500
the ﬂame proﬁle returns very closely to ΦL(x, t). For ε > 0 two small cusps
move towards the boundaries of the computational domain creating a quasi-steady
structure shown in Fig. 4(c) for t = 270. This structure survives until t
1800,
but eventually bifurcates, see Fig. 4(d), and the solution converges to ΦL(x +
∆x, t), ∆x < 0. It looks like the bifurcation in question is associated with the
lack of the asymptotic stability of the intermediate quasi-steady structure. As

such, it was triggered by a random perturbation and could equally result in the
displacement of the limiting ﬂame front proﬁle into the opposite direction ∆x >
0.

Behavior of perturbations ψ1,2(x, t∗) of the amplitude ε = 10−6 was not as
impressive, but they managed to produce a visible effect on the ﬂame front proﬁle.
The same can be said about ψ3,4(x, t∗) of the amplitude ε = 10−3. Perturbations
corresponding to ψα(x, t∗) of higher orders did not grow signiﬁcantly and did not
cause any noticeable changes to ΦL for ε up to 10−2.

Thus, the singular modes ψ1,2(x, t∗) should be responsible for the interaction
of the ﬂame front ΦL(x, t) with all the perturbations of small enough amplitude.
The time scale of these interactions is about 300 for L = 40π and is of order O(L)
in general. More singular modes ψα(x, t∗) of higher orders α > 2 are becoming
important as the amplitude of the perturbations grows. The time scale of evolution
of φ(x, t) for φ(x, 0) = ψα(x, t∗) lessens as α grows necessitating to take into
account the dependence of ψα(x, t∗) on t∗ and creating further problems in the
efﬁcient description of the subspace of important perturbations. Therefore, there
is a critical perturbation amplitude beyond which the representation of f (x, t) in
terms of the singular modes ψα(x, t∗) is not as beneﬁcial as for smaller amplitudes.

3 A simpliﬁed linear model

Prior to experimenting with (1) we consider a simpliﬁed linear model suggested
in [8]. The L-periodic steady coalescent NL-pole solution (2) has a characteristic
wavy or cellular structure and can be represented in a vicinity of the crest as
x2/(2R) + O(x4). Here, R is the radius of curvature of
ΦL(x, t)
the ﬂame front proﬁle in the crest. For large enough L, it can be approximated as

The inﬁnite time limit of (13) is equal e−2π2Rξ2

fectively on the time scale of order O(R). This time limit attains its maximum
eγ2R/8 cos ϕ for ξ0 = ξ∗ = γ/(4π), matching the asymptotic estimation of [8].
Note that the wave number of the largest Fourier component k∗ of both ψ1(x, t∗)
and ψ2(x, t∗) for t∗ > 300 is equal to ξ∗ = k∗/L = γ/(4π) as well, see Fig. 3.
A few graphical examples of function (13) are given in Fig. 5. Note that the ar-
gument of the cosine in (13) depends on time, which means that even if the initial
condition φ(0)(x) is a linear combination of mutually orthogonal cosine harmon-
ics, then the solution φ(x, t) will remain a linear combination of cosine harmonics
for t > 0, but those harmonics will no longer be mutually orthogonal. This ex-
plains why the most ampliﬁed perturbations are formed by linear combinations of
a few initially orthogonal harmonics and approximate ψ1,2(x, t∗) asymptotically
for L

.

Behaviour of (13) is in a sharp contrast with the evolution of the single har-

which grow inﬁnitely if ξ0 < γ/(4π) or decay otherwise. They are governed by
the equation associated with a self-adjoint differential operator, which is obtained
from (9) upon removal of the term R−1x∂xφ. Solution (14) does not result from
(13) for R
1. The difference be-
tween (13) and (14) is an explicit illustration of the nonnormality of (9) introduced

by the non-selfadjoint term R−1x∂xφ. Flattening of the crests of cellular ﬂames
and increasing local resemblance with the plane front as R increases was noticed
long time ago, prompting a hypothesis of a secondary Darrieus-Landau instabil-
ity. Model (9) indicates that the hypothesis is unlikely to be correct. Although,
because of the ﬂattening of the crests of the ﬂame front proﬁle, perturbations of
the front can be transiently ampliﬁed at a rate rapidly increasing with R, this tran-

sient ampliﬁcation is entirely different from the inﬁnite growth of perturbations
in the Darrieus-Landau instability of plane ﬂames. Moreover dynamics of pertur-
bations in the case of cellular ﬂames does not converge to that of the plane ones

The steady coalescent pole solutions to the Sivashinsky equation correspond
to the ﬂame fronts propagating steadily with the velocity exceeding ub = 1 by
VL, see e.g. [13]. Addition of the perturbation φ(x, t) results in a change in the
velocity of propagation by the value of the space average of ∂tφ, which we denote
< φt >. The correction provided by the φ(x, t) is only valid in a small vicinity
of the crest of ΦL(x, t) . In sequel, the correction of the speed < φt > is only
ε of the ﬂame front in a vicinity of the crest
valid for a small region
of ΦL(x, t). Hence, for our simpliﬁed linear model we deﬁne the increase of the
ﬂame propagation speed as follows:

the wavelength of the perturbation. The phase, or location of the perturbation, is
important as well.

4 The effect of noise

According to the results of Section 2, the forcing in the Sivashinsky equation can
be decomposed into the most ampliﬁable nonmodal component and the orthogo-
nal complement. The latter can be neglected reducing spatio-temporal stochastic

Thus, the amplitude of noise f0, alongside with the averages and the standard
tm and αm, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . are the only essential parameters
deviations of tm+1 −
of such a representation of noise.

The impulse-like noise (18) is used here for the sake of simplicity. Some
arguments towards its validity were suggested in [2]. More sophisticated and
physically realistic models of temporal noise characteristics can be used with (1)
as well.

If f0 ≪

σ−1
1 (t∗) then noise is not able to affect the ﬂame at all and can be
completely neglected. This case can be referred to as the noiseless regime. On the
other hand, if f0 is comparable with the amplitude a of the background solution
ΦL(x, t), then almost all components of noise will be able to disturb the ﬂame
and the f (x, t) in (1) should be treated as a genuine spatio-temporal stochastic
function. This is the regime of the saturated noise.

Eventually, there is an important transitional regime when the noise amplitude
f0 is at least of order of σ−1
1 (t∗), but still much smaller than a. In this case only the
disturbances with a signiﬁcant component in the subspace spanned by the linear
combinations of ψα(x, t∗), 1
α∗ have a potential to affect the solution.
All other disturbances can be neglected and the force f (x, t) in the Sivashinsky
equation (1) can be approximated by (18) with a ﬁnite value of α∗. We would
like to stress that though such representation of noise is correct for noise of any
amplitude, apparently it is only efﬁcient if f0 < σ−1
a, where α∗ is small
enough.

4.1 Noise in the linear model

A random point-wise set of perturbations uniformly distributed in time and in the
Fourier space is a suitable model for both the computational round-off errors and
a variety of perturbations of physical origins. We are adopting such a model in
our analysis in the following form

Using (11), (12) for the zero initial condition, the exact solution to (9), (19)

can be written as

The expression for <φt> is obvious, see (17), and is illustrated in Fig. 8. Here
we generated random sequences of the time instances tm with a given frequency
F = M(T )/T on a time interval t

the amplitude am were also randomly generated and uniformly distributed within
certain ranges. According to the formula for <φt>, the effect of the phase shift

ϕm just duplicates the am. Therefore, its value was ﬁxed as ϕm ≡
1, 1], then the time average of
<φt> is obviously zero, because of the linearity of the problem. In the Sivashinsky
equation this effect is compensated by the nonlinearity. The cusps generated by
the perturbations of opposite signs move into opposite directions along the ﬂame
surface, see Section 2, though they both contribute into the speed positively. This
effect of the nonlinearity can be mimicked by restricting the range of possible
values of the amplitudes, e.g. am ∈

[0, 1], as this can be seen in Fig. 8.

Figure 8(b) shows that the increase of <φt> seen in Fig. 8(a) can be matched
by using only the largest growing perturbations with much smaller frequency,
which is quite expected in virtue of the linearity of the problem. The amplitude of
ﬂuctuations in Fig. 8(a) is noticeably less than in Fig. 8(b). This is attributed to
the smoothing effect of the less growing perturbations.

Because of the linearity of the problem in question, the effect of F = M(T )/T
and L on <φt> is straightforward. In particular, the value of <φt> raises up to

Direct studies of the effect of noise in the Sivashinsky equation necessitate use
of numerical simulations. However, because of the intrinsic discontinuity of noise,
such DNS are hampered with very low accuracy of approximations questioning
the validity of numerical solutions. In this work we used explicit solutions (20)
in order to validate DNS of (9) and, in sequel, of (1). The DNS of (9), (19) was

with the same sets of tm, am, and ξm might be noticeable in a neighbourhood of

tm. Although, the averaged characteristics like <φt> were
quite accurate. So, this linear model validates the DNS of the forced Sivashinsky
equation at least in relation to the averaged ﬂame propagation speed.

Similar to the linear model (9) the only noticeable difference was in slightly larger
ﬂuctuations of <Φt>. Examples of the effect of composition of noise on <Φt>
are given in Fig. 11 too.

It was mentioned in the previous section that the wave number of the largest
Fourier component of ψ1,2(x, 103) is exactly the same as the wave number ξ0 =
γ/(4π) of the largest growing single harmonics solution to (9). We tried to ex-
ploit this observation and simpliﬁed (18) even further, replacing ψα(m)(x, t∗) by

This kind of forcing is able to speed up the ﬂame, but the difference between

sequences of tm. Although, effect of using (21) instead of (18) is appreciable.

The correlation between the ﬂame propagation speed and the noise amplitude
is obvious. Note that the f0 in the right most point in the graph is still about 20
times less than the amplitude of the variation of the background solution ΦL(x, t).

Figure 11: Examples of the effect of the composition of noise on < Φt > for
f0 = 10−3 and L = 40π.

In accordance with the idea developed in this paper, the value of <<Φt>> is
eO(L), resulting
determined by the product σ1f0. It was shown in [7] that σ1 ∝
in <<Φt>>=<<Φt>> (eO(L)f0). Thus, the data shown in Fig. 12 are at least in a
qualitative agreement with the dependence of <<Φt>> on L, which was obtained
10−16 associated with the computational
in [7] for a ﬁxed noise amplitude f0 ≈
round-off errors.

Eventually, in Fig. 13 we presented the results of an attempt to control the
ﬂame propagation speed using our special perturbations ψα(x, t∗) of properly se-
lected amplitudes. Graphs of < Φt > and << Φt >> are shown in the left and
numerical solution Φ(x, t) corresponding to this controlling experiment is illus-
trated in the right. The ﬂuctuations of the obtained ﬂame propagation speed are
large indeed, but at least, they appear in quite a regular pattern.

velocity ﬁeld, which is difﬁcult to manage in practice. The controlling function
is more effectively achieved by acoustic signals, see e.g. [14]. Acoustics was
neglected in the evaluation of the Sivashinsky equation and there is no easy and
straightforward way to incorporate it back into the model. However, because of
a strong coupling between the velocity and pressure ﬁelds, effects of acoustic
signals similar to those presented here can be expected as well.

5 Conclusions

Based on our analysis of the steadily propagating cellular ﬂames governed by the
Sivashinsky equation we may conclude that there are perturbations of very small
amplitude, which can essentially affect the ﬂame front dynamics. The subspace

18

formed by these special perturbations is of a very small dimension and its basis can
be used for an efﬁcient representation of the upstream velocity turbulence. These
are the very perturbations which cause the increase of the ﬂame propagation speed
in numerical experiments. Hence, theoretically, they can be used to model certain
regimes of ﬂame-turbulence interaction and to control the ﬂame propagation speed
on purpose.

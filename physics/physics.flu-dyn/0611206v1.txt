Abstract

We reconsider some fundamental aspects of the ﬂuid mechanics model, and the
derivation of continuum ﬂow equations from gas kinetic theory. Two topologies
for ﬂuid representation are presented, and a set of macroscopic equations are de-
rived through a modiﬁed version of the classical Boltzmann kinetic equation for
monatomic gases. The free volumes around the gaseous molecules are introduced
into the set of kinetic microscopic parameters. Our new description comprises four,
rather than three, conservation equations; the classical continuity equation, which
conﬂates actual mass-density and number-density in a single equation, has been split
into a conservation equation of mass (which involves only the classical number-
density of the gaseous particles) and an evolution equation purely of the mass-
density (mass divided by the actual volume of the ﬂuid). We propose this model as
a better description of gas ﬂows displaying non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium
(rareﬁed ﬂows), ﬂows with relatively large variations of macroscopic properties,
and/or highly compressible ﬂuids/ﬂows.

Key words: gas kinetic theory, Boltzmann equation, compressible ﬂuids and ﬂows,

1 Introduction

In rareﬁed gas dynamics, the Boltzmann kinetic equation is accepted as de-
scribing the evolution of the gaseous particle distribution function. This equa-
tion is presumed to be valid for any dilute gas ﬂow, and various kinetic models

have been developed as approximations to it. The most well-known are the
BGK relaxation model [1], the Chapman-Enskog perturbation method [2],
the Linearized Boltzmann equation with polynomial decompositions [3], and
the Grad moments method with Maxwellian weighting function [4], as well
as more recent extensions and developments of these models. All these ki-
netic models lead to the set of three hydrodynamic equations, usually called
the Navier-Stokes equations, that have amply demonstrated their success in
describing typical engineering ﬂows with relatively small density variations.
However, the description of ﬂows beyond the broad range of applicability of
the Navier-Stokes model (such as hypersonic ﬂows, or micro- or nano-scale gas
ﬂows) remains an active area of investigation.

The appropriateness of the Navier-Stokes model for a gas ﬂow rests on there
being suﬃcient local homogeneity in the ﬂow such that macroscopic variables
(e.g. mass-density, temperature, pressure etc.) are locally relatively uniform,
with only small departures from thermodynamic equilibrium. In this case, a
local Maxwellian representation can be assumed in approximating the solution
to the Boltzmann equation. Departures of the real distribution function of the
gaseous particles from the local Maxwellian are assumed to be only slight.
This assumption is acceptable if the following condition is satisﬁed by the
macroscopic ﬂow properties:

≪ 1,

dΦ
Φ (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
where Φ is a ﬂow macroscopic property. If condition (1) does not hold then
one or more macroscopic properties admit large relative variation, and the
distribution function cannot be safely assumed to depart only slightly from a
local equilibrium. The above assumptions and condition (1) play a key role
in the various kinetic models. Flows with large relative variations in their
macroscopic properties are not well understood (see, e.g., [5,6]) although there
have been numerous attempts to develop hydrodynamic models for this class
of ﬂows: see, e.g., [7,8,9,10].

In this paper we introduce a new treatment for ﬂuids and ﬂows that are sen-
sitive to relative variations of macroscopic ﬂow properties. We ﬁrst examine
the topological representations of gases and thereby attempt a rigorous deﬁni-
tion of both “mass-velocity” and “volume-velocity”. We then derive from the
fundamental kinetic theory the set of conservation equations corresponding
to a volume-representation of ﬂuids. While this approach owes much to the
recent work of Howard Brenner [11,12] and Hans Christian ¨Ottinger [13,14]
questioning the conventional ﬂuid mechanical description, our focus here is on
putting the volume-representation of gases on a more rigorous footing that is
rooted in the fundamental kinetic theory.

2 The topology of ﬂuid representation

A ﬂuid is composed of a great number of molecules occupying a given volume
in physical space. In the case of a gas, the physical volume occupied by the
gaseous molecules can be regarded as the envelope of the physical domain
occupied by the gas, and this can be represented geometrically. In a ﬁxed
reference frame this envelope may vary: for example, the gas may expand or
contract.

In this section we present two diﬀerent topological spaces for representing
gases. The ﬁrst is based on the individual point-mass particles, and the second
representation is based on the geometrical envelope of the gas in physical space
(i.e. the volume in which a number of gaseous molecules is dispersed). These
two topological spaces are two basically diﬀerent measures (or integration
forms). Associated with each are essentially diﬀerent ways to perform balances.

2.1 “Mass-based representation” and the measure deﬁned by

an element of mass

A gas may be regarded as discrete point-mass particles (the gaseous molecules)
distributed in physical space. Disregarding the shape of the geometrical do-
main occupied by the group of particles, we are only concerned with the num-
ber of point-mass particles.

A set, Ξm, is deﬁned by the discrete (numerated) molecules. Any open subset,
Ω, represents a prescribed number of molecules. The set of whole subsets, Ω,
of Ξm will be denoted Λm. We may deﬁne the following application:

Λm → R+,
Ω 7→ Mesm(Ω),

(2)

where Mesm(Ω) = M × nΩ, with M the molecular mass and nΩ the number of
point-mass molecules represented by Ω. Then Mesm(Ω) is the total measurable
mass of the molecules contained in Ω. This application deﬁnes a measure on
the topological space (Ξm, Λm). For any two diﬀerent open subsets, Ωi and Ωj
in Λm, so that Ωi ∩ Ωj = Ø, we have

Mesm(Ωi) + Mesm(Ωj) = mi + mj ,

(3)

where mi (or mj) is the mass constituting the element Ωi (or Ωj).

3

2.2 “Volume-based representation” and the measure deﬁned by

an element of volume

Instead of regarding only the point-mass particles, we might be concerned
with the physical domain occupied by these dispersed particles. A prescribed
number of molecules occupy a given volume in physical space. This volume can
be regarded as the geometrical envelope of this group of molecules. Considering
a gas in motion at a given time, t, the domain occupied by the group of gaseous
molecules can be split among the point-mass particles according to their real
position at this time t (see ﬁgure 1). So each gaseous particle is attributed a
microscopic fractional volume of the total volume occupied by the group of
molecules.

As a “volume of ﬂuid” means the physical volume occupied by an ensemble of
gaseous molecules, the microscopic volume attributed to each particle in this
description can be read as a “microscopic volume of ﬂuid”. Each microscopic
volume contains only one molecule, and the whole volume of ﬂuid is given by
the summation over all microscopic volumes. In this second ﬂuid topological
description, a prescribed “amount of ﬂuid” or a “volume of ﬂuid” means “a
number of microscopic volumes”.

A set, Ξv, is deﬁned by the microscopic volumes. Any open subset, Ω, repre-
sents a prescribed number of microscopic volumes. The set of these subsets Ω
of Ξv will be denoted Λv. We may deﬁne the following application:

Λv → R+,
Ω 7→ Mesv(Ω),

where Mesv(Ω) is the measurable value of the geometrical volume represented
by Ω. This application deﬁnes a measure on the topological space (Ξv, Λv). It
should be noted that, according to the microscopic volume distribution (see
also ﬁgure 1), the elementary microscopic geometrical volumes are such that,
for a couple of microscopic volumes Ωi and Ωj,

Ωi ∩ Ωj = Ø.

This ensures the measure additivity property. Therefore, for two diﬀerent open
subsets, Ωi and Ωj in Λv, so that Ωi ∩ Ωj = Ø, we have

Mesv(Ωi) + Mesv(Ωj) = vi + vj,

where vi (or vj) is the measurable value of the volume element Ωi (or Ωj).

tribution around a number of gaseous particles. The elementary microscopic volume
is small in regions with a greater number of molecules, and large in regions with
fewer molecules. A “volume of ﬂuid” is represented by the physical domain in which
the molecules are dispersed.

• from a purely mathematical point of view, an “elementary amount of vol-
ume” in the second description plays the same role as an “elementary
amount of mass” in the ﬁrst description;

• ﬁgure 1 may also be regarded as representing the element termed a “ﬂuid
particle” in ﬂuid mechanics, which is a volume domain containing a great
number of molecules.

2.3 The two barycentric velocities: volume velocity and mass velocity

Consider the motion of two molecules P1 and P2 between time t′ and t′′. At
time t′, the mass of molecule P1 is m1 and the mass of P2 is m2. Similarly the
microscopic volume associated with P1 is v1 while that associated with P2 is
v2. Each molecule has a given velocity at each time and at each position (see
ﬁgure 2), which will be denoted ξ.

From a mathematical point of view, two barycentric point systems can be
perfectly deﬁned according to the mass of the particles and according to the
microscopic volumes associated with the particles. In so doing, we have on one
side a system of barycentric points represented by the couples (mi, ξi) and on
the other side a system represented by the couples (vi, ξi). These two barycen-
tric systems lead to two diﬀerent barycentric velocities (or mean velocities).

These two barycentric velocities are evidently diﬀerent, as volume and mass
are two diﬀerent weighting elements. The volume barycentric velocity accounts
for the variations of the microscopic volumes in time and space, in addition to
the variations of the velocities of the point-mass particles. However, the mass
barycentric velocity accounts only for the variations of the velocities of the
point-mass particles, since the mass of the molecules is constant.

The two barycentric velocities will only be equivalent if there is a linear re-
lation between mass and microscopic volumes, which would mean a uniform
distribution of the particles in the ﬂuid without variation of the global volume
occupied the particles.

The barycentric velocities are expressed:

• volume barycentric velocity, Uv,

Mesm(Ωm) · Um =

ξdM ,

Ωm

Z

ZΩv

Mesv(Ωv) · Uv =

ξdV ,

(7)

(8)

where the integral summations are founded by the measures deﬁned in previ-
ous sections, and related to the mass-based and the volume-based representa-
tions, respectively.

We note here that the deﬁnitions (7) and (8) correspond to what have been
termed recently “mass-velocity” and “volume-velocity”, respectively [11,12].
The distinction between these mean velocities can also be shown from general-
ized concepts of “centre of mass” in more sophisticated diﬀerential geometries
in physics [15].

2.4 Hydrodynamic velocities and the equations of ﬂuid mechanics

In contrast to the motion of a solid body, hydrodynamics involves the motion
of a “volume of ﬂuid”. The motion of a volume occupied by gaseous molecules
is founded on the concept of an element termed a “ﬂuid particle”. Accordingly,
the mean velocity of any volume of ﬂuid should be deﬁned by the mean velocity
obtained by weighting each microscopic velocity by the respective microscopic
volume of ﬂuid.

In other words, and referring again to ﬁgure 1, the mean velocity of a ﬂuid
particle, which is an element of volume, is not the mean mass-velocity given
by the mass-based representation, but the velocity obtained by weighting the
microscopic velocities with the microscopic volumes. This is because the mean
velocity obtained by using mass as the weighting element corresponds strictly
to the velocity of a total amount of mass (the centre of mass), independent of
the volume of space occupied and therefore independent of the volume of the
ﬂuid particle.

While the velocity of the ﬂuid particle should properly be attributed to the
volume-based barycentric velocity, the choice of hydrodynamic velocity is not,
however, the sole questionable point in the process of deriving the ﬂuid equa-
tions. The main point lies in being consistent in the choice of velocity when
performing balances for mass, momentum and energy. This will be addressed
below.

7

2.5 An uncertainty in classical ﬂuid mechanics topology

The two measures described in sections 2.1 and 2.2 are connected to two
diﬀerent ways of performing integrations and balances. In the derivation of
the conventional set of ﬂuid mechanics equations, known as the Navier-Stokes
equations, a clear distinction has not been made between mass-based integra-
tions and volume-based integrations, and the volume barycentric velocity and
the mass barycentric velocity are treated as equivalent.

If V is a control volume of ﬂuid, and mV the total mass contained in V ,
the total amount of any property Q (momentum or energy) carried by the
control volume (which is, strictly speaking, the total amount of Q carried by
the amount of matter mV ) is generally given by

QdM ,

ZΩmV

ρQdV ,

ZV

which simply means the summation over all the elementary quantities of Q
carried by the elementary point-mass particles contained in the volume V .

In classical ﬂuid mechanics, for instance when deriving hydrodynamic equa-
tions such as the Navier-Stokes equations, the amount of property Q carried
in V is usually taken as

where ρ is taken as the ﬂuid mass-density. From a mathematical point of view,
the total amount given by expression (9) corresponds to the total amount
given by expression (10) if ρ is uniform over the control volume, V , i.e. that
dM = ρdV . Both expressions are equivalent only if there exists a simple linear
relation between the quantity of mass and the quantity of volume.

It is common in ﬂuid mechanics to argue expression (10) through the assump-
tions that a ﬂuid particle contains a great number of molecules, and that these
molecules are uniformly distributed so that ρ can be viewed as being locally
constant. However, these classical assumptions cannot be said to be completely
fulﬁlled in some important situations, so a perfect equality between expres-
sions (9) and (10) cannot always be presumed. Balances based on expression
(10) seem to be doubtful when (strong) density gradients are present in the
ﬂuid, or in suﬃciently rareﬁed gases where the ﬂuid volume must be quite
large to incorporate enough molecules.

To ensure equivalence of expressions (10) and (9) from a statistical point of
view, we suggest replacing ρ in expression (10) with the mean value, hρi, of ρ
over the ﬂuid particle:

(9)

(10)

(11)

hρi QdV .

ZV

8

But in this situation, two points need to be emphasised. First, the question of
the deﬁnition of the mass-density arises, because ρ cannot be simply deﬁned
as a limiting value of the mass-to-volume ratio [2]. The mass-density deﬁnition
introduced in expression (10) is properly deﬁned only when there are suﬃcient
molecules in the ﬂuid particle to smooth out any density ﬂuctuations. Second,
if Q is set to be the molecule velocities then expression (10) or (11) embody
the equality of “volume barycentric velocity” and “mass barycentric velocity”.
That is to say, for a ﬂuid element,

(12)

(13)

(14)

ξdm =

hρi ξdV = hρi

ξdV ,

ZΩm

ZV

ZΩv

then a ﬂuid particle velocity is such that

Um = Uv.

Obviously, this last equality is mathematically valid only for uniformly dis-
tributed molecules, or in the event of equivalence between the two measures
described in sections 2.1 and 2.2.

The classical ﬂuid mechanics argument that supports expression (10) is also
the local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption in gas dynamics. Assump-
tion of local thermodynamic equilibrium is acceptable when there are no large
variations in the thermodynamic parameters in the whole ﬂuid domain con-
cerned. In this case, expression (10) would be valid, as density may be safely
considered as locally constant. The gas ﬂow Knudsen number is usually deﬁned
as

Kn =

λm
ρ

δρ
δx

,

where λm is the molecular mean free path and x a spatial coordinate. Local
equilibrium is assumed when Kn → 0, which is the range admitted for validity
of the classical Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations. The equivalences that
we question in this section of the paper are only acceptable in the range
Kn → 0. Therefore it remains to investigate how to incorporate local non-
uniformity into hydrodynamic models of ﬂuid ﬂows.

2.6 A paradox in the classical continuity equation

Let us consider a mass, M0, of some rareﬁed gas containing a given number,
N0, of monatomic gaseous particles occupying a volume, V0. The particles are
uniformly distributed in V0. Suppose that at time t = 0 this gas is placed
in a vacuum (with no boundaries and no external force applied). The only
forces in the gas are through the interaction potential between particles. We
are interested in the time evolution of the mass-density of the ﬂuid.

9

As the molecules will scatter in all directions, it is expected that the mean
mass-velocity will be zero, and the classical continuity equation predicts only
a constant mass-density. However, the mass-density of the ﬂuid (i.e. mass
divided by volume of the gas) would be expected to decrease in time since the
gas volume will grow. Evolution of the mass-density without a mass-velocity
is in contradiction to the classical continuity equation.

Anticipating the discussion below and in Appendix A of the diﬀerence be-
tween number-density and mass-density, another inconsistency in the classical
continuity equation is outlined in Appendix B.

3 Kinetic theory and mass-density variations

In this section the problem of local density variations that we have outlined
in previous sections is addressed within the framework of the kinetic theory
of monatomic gases.

3.1 The distribution function in classical kinetic theory

Consider a physical space with reference to a ﬁxed inertial frame (X1, X2, X3).
In classical kinetic theory, f (t, X, ξ), termed “the particle distribution func-
tion”, is the probability number-density of particles which, at a given time
t, have their velocities in the vicinity of the velocity ξ, and are located in
the vicinity of the ﬁxed reference position X. This probability density gives a
number of particles at time t.

These particles occupy some geometrical domain, v(t, X), in physical space,
which is the (local) volume occupied around the ﬁxed position X. But the
distribution function as it stands does not contain information about how these
particles are scattered in v(t, X), or about the measurable value of v(t, X).

We can see that the distribution function, f (t, X, ξ), contains the following
information about the molecules at any time, t: velocity ξ, momentum Mξ,
energy Mξ2. None of the parameters t, X, or ξ contains information about the
real volume occupied by the group of particles. That is to say, macroscopic
descriptions derived from these parameters and from f (t, X, ξ) cannot contain
information about the volume occupied by the ﬂuid.

The classical assumption about volume in kinetic theory is to consider the
space element dX = dX1dX2dX3, which deﬁnes the vicinity of the reference
position X and which is, strictly speaking, a ﬁxed element of space related
to the frame (X1, X2, X3). Then it is assumed that the volume occupied by

10

the particles is the ﬁxed element dX, and that the molecules are uniformly
distributed in this element [2].

Consequently, the classical distribution function, f (t, X, ξ), suﬀers from the
same criticism presented in section 2.5. Nor does the classical conception of
a distribution function admit evolution of the volume, v(t, X), occupied by
the gaseous molecules in the ﬁxed frame (X1, X2, X3). The current conception
of f (t, X, ξ) is suitable for a (locally) uniform dispersion of molecules, and
for gases with no large compressibility eﬀects. It cannot correctly treat gases
ﬂowing under higher compressibility (or rarefaction) because in these cases
the assumption that dX ≡ v(t, X) is doubtful.

3.2 Kinetic theory modiﬁed for local density variations

According to our microscopic volume representation of ﬁgure 1, a microscopic
elementary volume is assigned to each gaseous particle. Therefore, we may
consider a distribution function which incorporates the microscopic elementary
volume as follows:

f (t, X, ξ, v) is the probability number-density of particles which, at a given
time t, are located in the vicinity of position X, have their velocities in
the vicinity of velocity ξ, and have an assigned microscopic volume in the
vicinity of volume v.

It is important to note that what is termed here the “vicinity of reference
position X” is deﬁned by a ﬁxed element dX = dX1dX2dX3 that is related
to the ﬁxed reference frame (X1, X2, X3) within which the ﬂuid motion is
being investigated. This element must not be confused with the element of
volume v, which is deﬁned through the real geometrical volume envelope of
the space occupied by an ensemble of molecules. In our new f (t, X, ξ, v), v
is the measurable positive value of the geometrical microscopic volume, and
quite distinct from X. The microscopic volume v can vary in an element of
volume dX: a prescribed number of particles can reduce their volume space or
expand it whilst the element dX is kept ﬁxed.

We note that, through our deﬁnition of f (t, X, ξ, v), the element dX may or
may not contain a great number of particles, and therefore may or may not
contain a great number of microscopic volumes of ﬂuid, v.

As the origin of any motion is the individual motion of the molecules (and
not of the microscopic volumes!), the statistical kinetic equation of the evolu-
tion of f (t, X, ξ, v) can be written similarly to the classical Boltzmann kinetic

11

ξr = ξ − ξ1 is the particle relative velocity, σ the collision diﬀerential cross
section, dω an element of solid angle, and ∇ξ denotes the formal operator
∇ξ = ∂/∂ξx + ∂/∂ξy + ∂/∂ξz. We recall that the collision integral (right-hand-
side of equation 15), is based on the elementary dynamics of collisions between
two point-mass particles, and uses their centre-of-mass.

1, v∗

The new term involving W in equation (15) arises from the introduction of
the new variable v into the distribution function. In fact, W may also be
written dv/dt, and then the supplementary term appears as the variation of
f due purely to volume lost to, or gained from, external space. Like the term
in F , which represents the external body force contribution to the variation
of f , W represents the contribution of any volume change to the variation
of f . Obviously, the rate of volume variation, W , should not depend on the
microscopic parameters, and the variables t, X, ξ and v are independent. For
example, W could be generated by macroscopic pressure gradients. In the
following, we will suppose no body force, i.e. F = 0.

According to our volume representation, the microscopic volume of two diﬀer-
ent particles involved in a collision is (v + v1) after the collision and (v∗ + v∗
1)
before the collision. This microscopic volume will vary in time because the
particle repartition is diﬀerent at each time. During a collision, the micro-
scopic volume carried by the particles is not aﬀected by the dynamics of the
interaction. Consequently, the variation of volume during collisions is only due
to the variation of the microscopic volumes of both particles in time. As we are
considering dilute gases, where the collision time is short compared to other
characteristic times, notably the time between two collisions, we can assume
that the variation of volume is larger during the relatively long time between
two collision than during the short time of the collision itself. As a result, the
microscopic volumes can be considered as conserved over the collision time,
i.e.

v∗ + v∗

1 = v + v1.

(16)

Thus we have, during a collision, a set of four conserved quantities: the micro-
scopic volume, v, supplemented by the three usual conserved quantities, i.e.
mass, momentum and energy.

3.2.1 Deﬁnitions of macroscopic quantities

The local number-density of the molecules within the ﬁxed reference frame
(i.e. referring to the element of volume, dX) is given by:

n(t, X) =

f (t, X, ξ, v)dvdξ ,

(17)

while the local mean value, ¯Q(t, X), of any property Q in dX can be deﬁned
by:

n(t, X) ¯Q(t, X) =

Z
For example, the local mean volume around each particle, ¯v(t, X), is deﬁned
by:

Z

−∞

Qf (t, X, ξ, v)dvdξ .

(18)

+∞

+∞

n(t, X)¯v(t, X) =

(19)

Z
From this mean value of the microscopic volume, a local mean value of the
mass-density in the vicinity of position X can be properly deﬁned through:

Z

−∞

¯ρ(t, X) =

n(t, X)M
n(t, X)¯v(t, X)

=

M
¯v(t, X)

,

(20)

where M is the molecular mass. The corresponding speciﬁc volume is given
by ¯v/M.

We note that n¯vdX is the actual volume of ﬂuid in the vicinity of X, containing
ndX gaseous molecules. In classical kinetic theory, these ndX molecules are
always assumed to occupy, and be uniformly dispersed in, the ﬁxed element of
space dX. Our new description is evidently diﬀerent: while the new deﬁnitions
of mass-density and speciﬁc volume represent mean values, and depend on t
and X, the gaseous molecules need not necessarily be uniformly dispersed in
the vicinity of X. Moreover, the total volume of ﬂuid around position X is
n¯vdX, not dX.

Appendix A contains more details on distinguishing between n and ¯ρ.

Two mean velocities can be deﬁned. First, the local mean mass-velocity,
Um(t, X), is given through

Mn(t, X)Um(t, X) =

Mξf (t, X, ξ, v)dξdv.

(21)

A local volume-velocity, Uv(t, X), can also be deﬁned by,

¯v(t, X)n(t, X)Uv(t, X) =

vξf (t, X, ξ, v)dξdv.

(22)

We note that the mean velocities deﬁned through equations (21) and (22) are
equivalent to the two velocity deﬁnitions pointed out in earlier sections of this
paper.

But another peculiar velocity can also be deﬁned using the volume-velocity
Uv:

C = ξ − Um .

C ′ = ξ − Uv .

(23)

(24)

The peculiar velocity given by equation (23), is usually supposed to deﬁne
the random motion of the point-mass particles. However, it may be noted in
equation (23) that only the macroscopic motion of the centre-of-mass, Um, is
removed from the point-mass velocities inside the peculiar velocity C. There-
fore, macroscopic motions due to expansion or compression of the ﬂuid element
may still be contained in C.

3.2.2 Conservation equations from the modiﬁed kinetic equation

We now show the derivation of new macroscopic equations from our kinetic
equation (15). This procedure is similar to the classical one: equation (15)
is multiplied by the microscopic quantities v, M, (Mξ), (Mξ2) and then the
result is integrated over dv and dξ. In this process it should be kept in mind
that t, X, ξ, and v are independent variables, while any mean value of a
microscopic quantity given through deﬁnition (18) depends on t and X.

• Conservation of volume. Multiplying equation (15) by the microscopic ele-

ment v, and integrating over v and ξ, we obtain,

(31)

The quantity Jv in equation (30) represents a ﬂux of volume due to point-
mass particle random motions deﬁned with the peculiar velocity C.

From equations (22) and (23), the local mean volume-velocity of the ﬂuid

may be written:

n¯vUv =

vUmf (t, X, ξ, v)dξdv +

vCf (t, X, ξ, v)dξdv.

Consequently, the following relation between the volume-velocity and the

also, the third integral term in relation (39) is zero owing to the generalized

4 A new set of macroscopic conservation equations

The set of macroscopic conservation equations obtained from our modiﬁed
kinetic equation (15) are:

• equation (36) for the volume;
• equation (35) for the mass;
• equation (42) for the momentum;
• equation (48) for the energy.

In this set of equations, the mean velocity Um(t, X) is by deﬁnition the mass-
velocity in each equation; the various ﬂuxes, Jv(t, X), q(t, X), and P(t, X)
are the ﬂuxes related to the peculiar velocity, C, deﬁned in equation (23).

Our new set of macroscopic equations are rewritten below for convenience,

5 Discussion

The new set of macroscopic equations, (49)–(52), is a set of four conserva-
tion equations instead of the usual three. The main novel aspect of our set of
equations is the replacement of the classical continuity equation, which usu-
ally involves both the number-density and the mass-density, by two separate
equations: a pure conservation equation of mass and an evolution equation for
the mass-density.

Although the momentum and energy equations look similar to the classical
conservation equations, it should be noted that they are mass-based equa-
tions through the number-density n, and they do not involve directly the
mass-density or the actual volume of ﬂuid. They also refer to a ﬁxed inertial
frame. This characteristic matches well the interpretation of equation (51)
as Newton’s second law which is, in its correct form, a mass-based law that
disregards the actual volume that contains the mass.

In terms of new features introduced by the two new relations in the set of
equations, we refer to the diﬀerence between an “incompressible ﬂow” and an
“incompressible ﬂuid”. Recalling that ∇·Um is the volume derivative following
the velocity Um, the continuity equation (49) is interpreted as the number-
density variation due to the ﬂow compressibility. On the other hand, ﬂuid
compressibility eﬀects, that are due to the variation of the ﬂuid mass-density,
are contained in relation (50). The compressibility involved in the new relation
(50) can be caused by signiﬁcant temperature or pressure variations in the
ﬂuid as it ﬂows, in contrast to the ﬁrst form of compressibility eﬀects which
are related to the ﬂow speed or acceleration.

The classical ﬂuid mechanics continuity equation combines the mass-density
and the number-density in a single equation, which therefore assumes equiva-
lency of compressibility eﬀects arising from the ﬂuid and from the ﬂow speed
— although it is well-known experimentally that these two eﬀects are diﬀer-
ent. Classifying a ﬂow as incompressible or not is diﬃcult in the context of
the classical continuum equations [16,17,18]. However, in our new model it is
clear that a ﬂow without compressibility eﬀects can only be assumed if there
are insigniﬁcant relative variations of the mass-density (through equation 50)

18

and insigniﬁcant volume variation under acceleration, ∇ · Um = 0 (through
equation 49).

The departure of ﬂow solutions of our new set of equations from solutions
of the classical equations may be expected in a range of ﬂows that suﬀer
from high ﬂuid compressibility eﬀects, even if the ﬂow itself remains within
the conventional incompressible condition (i.e. the ﬂow Mach number less than
about 0.3); examples of such ﬂows include those seen in and around microscale
devices [18] and other rareﬁed gas ﬂow situations.

If there is no mass-density variation then there is no rate of volume variation,
i.e. W = 0, and no ﬂux of volume, i.e. Jv = 0. In this case, equation (50)
disappears and our set of equations reverts to the usual three-equation model
in which the mass-density is simply ¯ρ = Mn. On the other hand, if the mass-
velocity, Um, is zero then equations (31) and (33) give,

∂n¯v
∂t

+ ∇ · [n¯vUv] = nW ,

(53)

which is thus an equation of expansion (or compression) of the ﬂuid in which
W is the term of volume of ﬂuid production. This equation accompanies the
energy equation even in situations where the mass-velocity evolution equation
(51) can be disregarded. An example of such a situation is the conﬁguration
described as paradoxical in section 2.6.

In our modiﬁed kinetic equation (15), W appears as the internal rate of change
of volume occupied by the gas, and is independent of the microscopic param-
eters, i.e. W = dv/dt. If we assume this rate of change of volume is associated
with variations of the macroscopic parameters, such as the ﬂuid temperature
and pressure which we denote in this paper as T ′ and p′, respectively, we can
then write the following formal expression,

W =

∂p′

 

.

!T ′

(55)

(56)

The dimensions of these two coeﬃcients suggest α ≈ 1/T ′ and χ ≈ 1/p′.
In this case, these approximations represent simple equations to describe the
variations of the volume around gaseous particles as a function of the ﬂuid
macroscopic parameters; they should not be taken as a derivation of an equa-
tion of state. This is because equations (54) and (55) concern variations of the

19

“microscopic volume” around each particle, while a thermodynamic equation
of state is correctly applied only to a “macroscopic volume” of ﬂuid — and
requires equilibrium conditions.

Using the above approximation for W , the mass-density equation (50) can be
rewritten:

D ¯ρ
Dt

=

¯ρ2
Mn

∇ · [Jv] − ¯ρ

α

− χ

dT ′

dp′

.

(57)

In this equation, the left-hand-side derivative is the material derivative that
involves Um while on the right-hand-side is a total derivative which does not
always equal the material derivative. For example, the total derivative, d /dt,
may be expressed using velocity Uv rather than the mass velocity Um, i.e.

d
dt

∂
∂t

1
n¯v

=

+ Um · ∇ +

Jv · ∇ .

(58)

Now, equation (57) enables us to solve in outline the problem posed in section
2.6. We admit zero mass velocity in this ﬂow conﬁguration, so equation (57)
is re-written

1
¯ρ

∂ ¯ρ
∂t

=

¯ρ
Mn

∇ · [Jv] −

− χ

dT ′

.

As we are only concerned with the variation in time, we may assume an
approximately uniform evolution of the ﬂuid domain, i.e ∇ · [Jv] = 0 (i.e. the
ﬂux of volume depends only on time, not space). Then the solution of this
problem is determined through

(59)

(60)

1
¯ρ

∂ ¯ρ
∂t

.

This solution is independent of the number-density, n (which is connected to
the ﬁxed reference frame of the observer), so the solution of equation (60) is
independent of the reference frame. As the compressibility coeﬃcients do not
depend explicitly on time, but only on the gas properties such as temperature
and pressure, then the solution of equation (60) can be written:

¯ρ = ¯ρ0 exp {α(T ′ − T ′

0) − χ(p′ − p′

0)} ,

(61)

0 ≡ p′

0(X) and T ′

with ¯ρ0 ≡ ¯ρ0(X), p′
0(X) the initial values of mass-
density, pressure and temperature of the gas. As a result, equation (61) gives
the evolution of the mass-density with the temperature and the pressure —
although this does not aﬀect the assumption of mass conservation embodied
in equation (49).

0 ≡ T ′

Equation (60) is not completely new; it, or an approximate form, is usually
assumed in ﬂuid mechanics for ﬂows presenting density variation eﬀects. The
originality of our model is that this equation is actually embodied in the kinetic

20

equation (15). This equation is therefore not a simple phenomenological rela-
tion, as usually presented, but is contained within the full set of conservation
equations. Equation (60) describes the local mean value of the mass-density
even when the classical assumption of real local uniformity does not hold.

6 Conclusions

In this article we have suggested there may be inconsistencies in the classical
treatment of the “mass of ﬂuid” and the “volume of ﬂuid” descriptions. These
inconsistencies appear to become important (a) if signiﬁcant relative variations
in density arise in the ﬂuid, and/or (b) in ﬂows in which the local equilibrium
assumption does not hold. Two diﬀerent representations of ﬂuids have been
outlined, and a volume-based kinetic approach has been introduced through
a slightly modiﬁed version of the Boltzmann kinetic equation.

The set of macroscopic equations derived from our modiﬁed kinetic equation
has a fundamental departure from the classical description of ﬂuid mechanics:
an evolution equation purely of the mass-density is added to the set of three
conservation equations (for number-density, momentum and energy). While
conservation of mass is embodied in an equation involving only the particle
number-density, mass-density evolution is embodied in a separate conservation
equation which invokes a ﬂux of volume and incorporates parameters that can
generate ﬂuid volume variation (such as temperature or pressure variations).
Our new model, therefore distinguishes between compressibility eﬀects arising
from the “ﬂuid compressibility” and from the “ﬂow compressibility”.

The nature of the velocity appearing in the classical Navier-Stokes set of equa-
tions has recently been questioned [12]. It has been suggested, although with-
out rigorous proof, that in the set of ﬂuid mechanics equations the velocity to
be used when writing the Newton viscosity law should be the volume-velocity.
In the present article we have shown that, from the kinetic theory point of
view, mass-velocity and volume-velocity can be properly deﬁned: mass-velocity
gives only the velocity of the centre-of-mass of a ﬂuid element, while volume
velocity accounts for expansion or compression of the ﬂuid element.

In classical kinetic theory, the pressure tensor and heat ﬂux are systematically
attributed to the ﬂuxes Pij(t, X) and q(t, X) appearing in the conservation
of momentum and energy equations, and these ﬂuxes are founded on the pe-
culiar velocity. But in the new volume-based kinetic approach introduced in
this paper, two diﬀerent peculiar velocities can be deﬁned. Therefore further
investigations are required in order to connect the real pressure tensor, heat
ﬂux, and internal energy of the ﬂuid to the various ﬂuxes appearing in the set
of conservation equations. We address this issue in a complementary paper,

21

so that a complete set of hydrodynamic equations is derived.

mass-density

A.1 Preliminaries

Let us consider a ﬁxed inertial reference frame, RG, with reference to the
coordinate elements (X1, X2, X3). In this ﬁxed reference we investigate the
motion of a cubic volume element of ﬂuid. We suppose that our cubic element
of ﬂuid is always attached to a moving reference frame, RF , with coordinate
elements (F1, F2, F3). Moreover, our cubic element of ﬂuid is determined at
any time by the three base vectors of the reference frame RF .

For simplicity we assume that initially both reference frames coincide, i.e.,
initially the three base vectors of both frames RG and RF are the same.
Regarding the ﬁxed frame RG, the second frame representing our element of

23

ﬂuid can have the following types of motions: translation, rotation (according
to three Eulerian angles), and expansion or compression.

An element of volume in the ﬁxed reference frame is denoted by dX = dX1dX2dX3
while an element of volume in the frame representing the cubic element of ﬂuid
is dF = dF1dF2dF3. The element of volume dX and dF may be formally linked
by relation

dX = JdF ,

(A.1)

where J is the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant of the transforma-
tion of RG into RF . If RF is undergoing only translations or rotations in the
ﬁxed reference RG, then J = 1 as rotation and translation conserve volumes.
Otherwise, if compression or expansion occurs then we have J 6= 1.

A.2 The number density, n, and the mass-density, ¯ρ

In our new kinetic approach introduced in this paper, f (t, X, ξ, v) is a prob-
ability number density in the phase space (X, ξ, v). This means the num-
ber of particles within an element of volume of this phase space, dXdξdv, is
f (t, X, ξ, v)dXdξdv. The number of particles around a position, X, may be
denoted n(t, X)dX :

n(t, X)dX =

f (t, X, ξ, v)dξdv.

Z

Z

The total number of gaseous particles in the whole space referenced by the
ﬁxed frame RG is

N =

n(t, X)dX .

Z

(A.3)

Accordingly, n(t, X) appears as a “number-density” referring to the ﬁxed ref-
erence frame (X1, X2, X3). It is a number of particles divided by the ﬁxed
element of volume dX.

Because of expansion or compression of the reference frame (F1, F2, F3) during
motion, we cannot presume a correspondence between the element of volume
dX and the element of volume dF which gives the actual volume of the ﬂuid.
Therefore, the correct number-density referring to the real volume occupied
by the ﬂuid is not directly given by n but may be diﬀerent by the dilatation
or compression coeﬃcient J.

As the mean value of the microscopic volume of ﬂuid around the particles, ¯v,
is deﬁned through

n(t, X)¯v(t, X) =

vf (t, X, ξ, v)dvdξ ,

(A.4)

it is found, using equation (A.2), that the volume occupied by the ﬂuid at
reference position X is given by (ndX)¯v, i.e. the total number of microscopic
volumes of ﬂuid (or number of particles) multiplied by the mean value of these
microscopic volumes, ¯v. This volume of ﬂuid contains ndX gaseous molecules.
Therefore, when we refer to the actual volume of the ﬂuid, the “number-
density” is

A.3 The classical kinetic theory view of density

In classical kinetic theory, molecules are assumed to always occupy, and be
uniformly dispersed in, the element of space dX without a clear distinction
between the actual volume occupied by the gaseous molecules and the physical
space connected to the ﬁxed inertial reference frame. Chapman & Cowling
[2] state that: “. . . the mass contained by dX will be proportional only to its
volume, and will not depend on its shape. . . Similarly, the number of molecules
in dX . . . is proportional to dX. It will be denoted by ndX; n is called the
number-density of molecules.”

In others words, ndX is the number of particles in the volume element dX which
itself is regarded as the volume of the ﬂuid. Therefore, in this description
expansion or compression of the volume element dF in the ﬁxed reference
(X1, X2, X3) is disregarded.

According to this classical view, the number-density referring to the element
of volume dX is written

while the volume of ﬂuid around each particle is given by

(A.5)

(A.6)

(A.7)

(A.8)

We see that the classical description imposes directly a unit volume of ﬂuid
given by the inverse of the number density n. From our equation (A.5), the
unit volume of ﬂuid is ¯v, which refers to the actual volume of the ﬂuid, dF .
The classical unit volume, 1/n, refers to the volume element dX of the ﬁxed
inertial reference frame. These quantities may therefore diﬀer by a compres-
sion/dilatation coeﬃcient J.

If the particles are uniformly distributed, i.e. no mass density variation in
the ﬂuid, then ndX is the number of particles always occupying uniformly the
volume dX. In this case, the mean microscopic volume, ¯v, around each particle
is given by the volume dX divided by the number of particles ndX,

Consequently, only in this particular situation does the deﬁnition of the mass-
density, equation (A.6), become

¯v =

Generally, however, Mn is diﬀerent from ¯ρ. The density quantity Mn may be
regarded as the density of a similar ﬂuid under similar conditions although
with compression and expansion motions removed; the actual density of the
ﬂuid is given by ¯ρ. The product n¯v behaves like a compression/dilatation
coeﬃcient, which depends on time and position.

Finally, the distinction between the actual element of volume of ﬂuid and the
simple element of volume taken in the ﬁxed inertial reference frame raises a
question of consistency in the deﬁnition of the pressure tensor from kinetic
theory. The pressure tensor deﬁnition invokes a volume element of ﬂuid for
which the classical conceptual frame does not make a distinction between the
ﬁxed element, dX, and the element of volume of ﬂuid, dF . The real element of
ﬂuid should therefore be decoupled from the ﬁxed frame of the observer.

B The Euler form of the continuity equation

Here we consider incompressible ﬂows, by which we mean only ∇ · Um = 0. We
suppose, however, that variations of density, and then variations of the volume,
of a ﬂuid element can exist; for example, through variations of temperature in
time and space.

Let us follow a ﬁxed amount of mass, Mf , of ﬂuid, occupying at time t0 a
volume V0, and occupying at time t the volume V . In classical ﬂuid mechanics,
if we denote ρ ≡ ρ(t, X) the density of the ﬂuid, then we should have

ZV
A change of variables can be applied so that

where, as in equation (A.1), J is due to the application transforming V0 into
V . Equation (B.2) may be applied at t = t0, in which case J(t = t0) = J0 = 1.
So equation (B.2) can be written

As Mf is an arbitrary amount of mass, and V0 an arbitrary volume, equation
(B.3) becomes

so we can write the following:

[J0ρ0 − Jρ]dV0 = 0 .

ZV0

[J0ρ0 − Jρ] = 0 ,

D(Jρ)
Dt

= 0 ,

for any time t. In equation (B.5) the derivative is a material (convective)
derivative because we are explicitly moving with the mass, as we impose Mf
to be constant. This equation, due to Euler, is known as the material form of
the continuity equation [19]. We note that in our case J depends on time t:
at t = t0, J = 1, but nothing is stated about the derivative of J (i.e., nothing
imposes DJ/Dt = 0 for t = t0).

The local form of the conventional continuity equation (with ∇ · Um = 0) is

Dρ
Dt

= 0 .

Therefore, a contradiction appears between the material form of the continuity
equation (B.5) and the common ﬂuid mechanics expression (B.6) because J
depends on time — but these two expressions should be the same as they are
expressing the same physical law.

Using our description of density from Appendix A, the density of the ﬂuid
which should be used in equations (B.1)–(B.5) is ρ = ¯ρ = M/¯v, where the
expansion/compression coeﬃcient J is n¯v. So, replacing these elements in
equation (B.5), we ﬁnd

D(Mn)
Dt

= 0 ,

which is the correct local form of the mass continuity equation: the contra-
diction existing between the Euler equation (B.5) and the classical local form
of the continuity equation disappears in our description in which the density
is ¯ρ, equation (A.6), and the local form of the continuity equation is equa-
tion (B.7). The Euler equation (B.5) and equation (B.7) are therefore entirely
equivalent in our description.

The density of the ﬂuid, ¯ρ, which varies according to changes in the properties
of the ﬂuid, satisﬁes the Euler form of the continuity equation; the quantity

Mn behaves like a reference density, retracing the conservation of mass from a
reference frame in which any change in the properties of the ﬂuid is observed.
Our reference amount of mass, Mf , is simply always constant.

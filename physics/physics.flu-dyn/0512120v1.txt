The mean electromotive force caused by turbulence of an electrically conducting ﬂuid, which plays
a central part in mean–ﬁeld electrodynamics, is calculated for a rotating ﬂuid. Going beyond most
of the investigations on this topic, an additional mean motion in the rotating frame is taken into
account. One motivation for our investigation originates from a planned laboratory experiment with
a Ponomarenko-like dynamo. In view of this application the second–order correlation approximation
is used. The investigation is of high interest in astrophysical context, too. Some contributions to the
mean electromotive are revealed which have not been considered so far, in particular contributions
to the α–eﬀect and related eﬀects due to the gradient of the mean velocity. Their relevance for
dynamo processes is discussed. In a forthcoming paper the results reported here will be speciﬁed to
the situation in the laboratory and partially compared with experimental ﬁndings.

INTRODUCTION

In mean–ﬁeld electrodynamics of turbulent ﬂuids the
mean electromagnetic ﬁelds follow Maxwell’s equations.
The turbulence, however, gives rise to a mean electromo-
tive force, which occurs in Ohm’s law and, consequently,
in the induction equation. This mean electromotive force,
which is crucial in the theory of cosmic magnetic ﬁelds
and dynamos as well as in other ﬁelds, has been an ob-
jective of many investigations. It has been calculated in
speciﬁc approximations for diﬀerent forms of turbulence
on a rotating body under the assumption of zero mean
motion of the ﬂuid in the rotating frame, see, e.g., [1–
10]. In a few cases also the eﬀect of a mean motion has
been studied. There are some rather general results of
that kind, e.g., [1, 2], the application of which requires
however further elaboration. The more detailed results
derived recently, [11–13] and [14], are not in convincing
agreement with each other.

By this reason we have again dealt with the mean elec-
tromotive force in a rotating turbulent ﬂuid in the pres-
ence of a mean motion. The primary motivation for deal-
ing with this topic was to ﬁnd estimates of the eﬀects of
turbulence in a laboratory experiment with a screw dy-
namo as proposed by Ponomarenko [15], which is under
preparation in the Institute for Continuous Media Me-
chanics in Perm; see [16–19]. Moreover the results are of
high interest for astrophysical applications, for instance
in view of the possibility of the “W
J dynamo”, which
has been proposed recently [14, 20].

In this paper the mean electromotive force is consid-

ered in the presence of a more or less arbitrary mean ﬂow,
and in a forthcoming one [21] we will specify the results
and discuss them in view of the situation in the exper-
imental device.
(For a ﬁrst, very short report on this
topic see [22].) In Section 2 of this paper we describe the
general framework of our investigation. In Section 3 we
explain some general aspects of our view on the problem
and use basic symmetry laws to draw conclusions con-
cerning the structure of the mean electromotive force,
that is, concerning its dependence on vectorial and ten-
sorial quantities that characterize the turbulence and the
mean motion. In order to determine the mean electromo-
tive force completely, we introduce in Section 4 speciﬁc
approximations, in particular some kind of second–order
approximation, and calculate all of its coeﬃcients in their
dependence on the intensity of the turbulence and related
parameters. Finally in Section 5 we discuss our results in
general terms, compare them with those of other inves-
tigations and point out their consequences for dynamo
processes.

U is the velocity and η the magnetic diﬀusivity of the

Following the lines of mean-ﬁeld electrodynamics (see,
e.g., [2, 5]) we deﬁne mean magnetic and velocity ﬁelds,

B and U , as averages over space or time scales larger
than those of the turbulence. We call B
U
simply “ﬂuctuations” and denote them by b and u, re-
spectively. We further assume that the Reynolds averag-
ing rules apply. Taking the average of equation (1) we
obtain the mean-ﬁeld induction equation

where E is the mean electromotive force due to the ﬂuc-
tuations of magnetic ﬁeld and velocity,

E = u

×

The equation for b resulting from (1) and (2) allows
us to conclude that E can be considered as a functional
of U , u and B, which is linear in B. Furthermore E in
a given point in space and time depends on U , u and
B not only in this point but also on their behaviors in
a certain neighborhood of this point. We assume that
E has no part independent of B, that is, it is not only
linear but also homogeneous in B. We further accept the
frequently used assumption that B varies only weakly in
space and time so that E in a given point depends on B
only via its components and their ﬁrst spatial derivatives
in this point. Hence, E can be represented in the form

Ei = aij Bj + bijk ∂Bj/∂xk ,

(4)

where the tensors aij and bijk are averaged quantities
determined by U and u. Here and in the following a
Cartesian co–ordinate system (x1, x2, x3) is used and the
summation convention is adopted. Relation (4) is equiv-
alent to

see, e.g., [4] or [10]. Here α and β are symmetric tensors
of the second rank, γ and δ are vectors, and κ is a tensor
of the third rank, all depending on U and u only. Further
(∇B)(s) is the symmetric part of the gradient tensor of
B, i.e. (∇B)(s)

The term with α in (5) describes the α–eﬀect, which
is in general anisotropic, that with γ a transport of mean
magnetic ﬂux by the turbulence. The terms with β and
δ can be interpreted by introducing a modiﬁed magnetic
diﬀusivity, again in general anisotropic. The induction
eﬀects which correspond to these terms are usually ac-
companied by such described by the term κ, which al-
lows no simple independent interpretation. More details
will be explained in Sections V B–V D.

B. Momentum balance

(3)

We will consider the situation as described so far in a
rotating frame of reference and restrict our attention to
an incompressible ﬂuid. The ﬂuid velocity U is assumed
to satisfy the momentum balance and the incompressibil-
ity condition in the form

Here ̺ is the mass density and ν the kinematic viscos-
ity of the ﬂuid, p the hydrodynamic pressure including
the centrifugal pressure, Ω the angular velocity respon-
sible for the Coriolis force, and f an artiﬁcial external
force, which should mimic the cause of the turbulence.
Any inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on the ﬂuid motion
is ignored.

III. THE STRUCTURE OF THE MEAN
ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE E

A. Change to a proper frame of reference

Let us now focus our attention on the electromotive
force E in a given point, consider the mean motion as
independent of time and specify the frame of reference
in which (7) applies such that U = 0 in this point.
The result for E obtained in this frame, understood as
a vector with the usual transformation properties, ap-
plies then also in any other frame; see also [21]. Re-
maining in the frame speciﬁed such that U = 0 in the
considered point we introduce the simplifying assump-
tion that in the neighborhood of this point relevant for
the determination of E the mean velocity U varies only
weakly. More precisely, we assume that it can be rep-
resented there with respect to the frame speciﬁed above
in the form U i = Uijxj with Uij being constant, where
(x1, x2, x3) means a new Cartesian co–ordinate system
deﬁned in the rotating frame such that x1 = x2 = x3 = 0
in the point considered.

B. Homogeneous background turbulence

We further assume until further notice that the turbu-
lent ﬂuctuations u deviate from a homogeneous isotropic

mirror–symmetric turbulence only as a consequence of
the Coriolis force deﬁned by Ω and of the gradient of
the mean ﬂuid velocity, that is, the gradient tensor ∇U
given by (∇U )ij = ∂U i/∂xj, or (∇U )ij = Uij. For
particular purposes we split ∇U into its symmetric and
antisymmetric parts. The symmetric one is the rate of
strain tensor, D, given by Dij = 1
2 (∂U i/∂xj + ∂U j/∂xi).
It describes the deforming motion close to the point con-
sidered. Due to the incompressibility of the ﬂuid we have
∇
U = 0 and therefore Dii = 0. The antisymmetric
part, A, given by Aij = 1
∂U j/∂xi), corre-
sponds to a rigid body rotation of the ﬂuid close to this
1
2 ǫijlWl
point. We may represent it according to Aij =
by the vector W = ∇

2 (∂U i/∂xj −

U .

−

·

×

×

In order to prepare conclusions concerning the struc-
ture of E = u
b we ﬁrst recall symmetry properties of
the equations (1) and (7) governing B and U . If these
equations are satisﬁed with given B, U , ∇p, Ω and f ,
they are, too, with other B, U , ∇p, Ω and f derived
from the given ones by a rotation about any axis run-
ning, e.g., through x = 0. Likewise they are satisﬁed
with B, U , ∇p, Ω and f derived from the given ones
by reﬂecting them at a plane, e.g., one containing x = 0
and, in addition, changing the signs of B and Ω. These
two properties apply analogously to consequences drawn
from these equations, in particular to the equations gov-
erning u and b. The ﬁrst property, connected with the
rotation of ﬁelds, leads to the conclusion that the tensors
aij and bijk, which occur in (4), and therefore also α,
γ, β, δ and κ cannot contain any construction elements
other than the isotropic tensors δlm and ǫlmn, the vec-
tors Ω and W and the tensor D. Note that the force
f , which is assumed to cause a homogeneous isotropic
turbulence, can not introduce other than isotropic quan-
tities. The second property, connected with reﬂection, is
often described by considering U , ∇p, and f as polar
and B and Ω as axial vector ﬁelds. By contrast to polar
vectors the axial ones show speciﬁc sign changes of their
components under reﬂection of the coordinate system.
We adopt this concept and distinguish between “true”
and “pseudo” scalars, vectors and tensors, where we call
polar and axial vectors simply “true” and “pseudo” vec-
tors, respectively. Then aij and bijk have to be pseudo
tensors. This implies that α, δ and κ are also pseudo
quantities but γ and β true quantities.

Let us consider ﬁrst α and γ. The mentioned construc-
tion elements δlm, ǫlmn, Ω, W and D allow us neither
to built a pseudo tensor of the second rank nor a true
vector. That is, we have

αij = 0 ,

γi = 0 .

(8)

In contrast to this there are several non–zero contri-
butions to βij, δi and κijk. For the sake of simplicity we
give only those of them which are linear in Ω, W and

3

D, that is,

βij = β(0)δij + β(D)Dij ,
κijk = κ(Ω)(Ωj δik + Ωkδij)

(9)
+κ(W )(Wj δik + Wkδij) + κ(D)(ǫijlDkl + ǫiklDjl) .

δi = δ(Ω)Ωi + δ(W )Wi ,

Here β(0), β(D), δ(Ω),
are coeﬃcients determined by u
but independent of Ω, W and D. Because of ∇
B = 0
terms of κijk containing δjk would not contribute to E
and may therefore be dropped.

κ(D) are
· · ·
called “mean–ﬁeld coeﬃcients” in the following.

The β(0) and β(D) terms in (10) make that the mean–
ﬁeld diﬀusivity deviates from the original magnetic diﬀu-
sivity η of the ﬂuid. Due to the β(0) term the mean–ﬁeld
diﬀusivity turns into η + β(0), due to the β(D) term it
becomes anisotropic. The δ(Ω) and δ(W ) terms, too, can
be discussed as contributions to the mean–ﬁeld diﬀusiv-
ity. They lead to skew–symmetric contributions to the
diﬀusivity tensor. In another context the eﬀect described
by the δ(Ω) term has been called “Ω
J –eﬀect”. It has
been shown that this eﬀect in combination with a diﬀer-
ential rotation, here a dependence of Ω on r, is able to
establish a dynamo; see [23–26]. The δ(W ) term describes
an eﬀect analogous to the Ω
J –eﬀect, which has been
J –eﬀect”. It
revealed only recently [14]. We call it “W
occurs however even in the absence of the Coriolis force,
only as consequence of a shear in the mean motion. We
will discuss the δ(Ω) and δ(W )–eﬀects as well as the κ(Ω),
κ(W ) and κ(D)–eﬀects in more detail in Section V D.

C.

Inhomogeneous background turbulence

Let us now relax the assumption that the original tur-
bulence is homogeneous and isotropic. We admit an in-
homogeneity and an anisotropy due to a gradient of a
quantity like the turbulence intensity and introduce a
vector g in the direction of this gradient, e.g., by putting
∇u2 = g u2, with u2 derived from the turbulent velocity
u. Then we have to add g to the above–mentioned con-
struction elements of α, γ, β, δ and κ. As a consequence
α and γ can well be non-zero. For the sake of simplicity
we assume that the inﬂuence of g on these quantities is
so weak that they are at most of ﬁrst order in g. We

have then

Our considerations on the structure of the electromo-

the intensity or other parameters of the turbulent ﬂow.
To calculate these coeﬃcients we start again from the in-
duction equation (1) and the momentum balance in the
form (7), both related to the moving frame of reference
deﬁned above. From equation (1) and its mean–ﬁeld ver-
sion (2) and from equation (7) and the corresponding
mean–ﬁeld version we derive the equations governing the

We restrict our calculation on the case in which the
inﬂuences of both the Coriolis force and the shear of the
mean motion on u and b are only weak. We introduce
the expansions

u = u(0) + u(1) +

,

b = b(0) + b(1) +

(15)

· · ·

· · ·

where u(0) and b(0) are independent of Ω, W and D,
further u(1) and b(1) of ﬁrst order, and all contributions
of higher order in these quantities. In

that sense we have

In the following we restrict our attention on the case in
which E is linear in Ω, W and D, that is, on the terms
E (0) and E (1) in this expansion of E.

We assume that both u and b are small enough so that
the second–order correlation approximation (SOCA) ap-
plies, sometimes also labelled as ﬁrst–order smoothing
approximation (FOSA), which is often used in astrophys-

In Section II A we have introduced the assumption that
E has no contribution independent of B. In the second–
order correlation approximation this assumption is auto-
matically satisﬁed, a contribution of this kind can not oc-
cur. The second–order correlation approximation in the
above sense also excludes any kind of magnetohydrody-
namic turbulence. In the limit of small B the turbulence
is purely hydrodynamic.

B. Fourier representation

We will carry out some of our calculations in the
Fourier space. The Fourier transformation is deﬁned in
the form

Q(x, t) =

ˆQ(k, ω) exp(i(k

ωt)) d3k dω ,

(18)

where the integrations are over all k and ω.

Let us consider the two–point correlation tensor φij for

two vector ﬁelds v and w deﬁned by

φij (x1, t1; x2, t2) =

vi(x1, t1) wj(x2, t2)
i
h

.

Here and in what follows the notation
is used in the
same sense as X. Following [27] we consider φij also as
a function of the variables

R = (x1 + x2)/2 ,
T = (t1 + t2)/2 ,

D. Calculation of E (0)

Starting from (32) and using (35) we ﬁnd

We consider now E and the corresponding quantities
like aij and bijk at R = 0 and T = 0. If we drop the
arguments R and T we always refer to R = 0 and T = 0.
As already mentioned we restrict ourselves on an approx-
imation in which E consists only of the terms E (0) and
E (1) in the expansion (16).

Let us start with E (0). Clearly E (0) and the corre-
ij and b(0)
sponding contributions a(0)
ijk to aij and bijk are
independent of Ω, W and D. In view of E (0) we consider
ﬁrst the contribution χ(0)
jk to χjk. By reasons which will
become clear soon we consider for a moment χ(0)
jk (R, T )
with arbitrary R and T and will go only later to the limit
0 and put T = 0. We introduce the notation

We assume that all mean quantities vary only weakly

with R and not with T . In that sense we expand [Ekj]
−
in (37) in a series with respect to K but neglect all terms
of higher than ﬁrst order in K, and put Ω = 0. The ﬁrst–
order terms have factors Ki under the integrals, and these
correspond to the application of the operator
i∂/∂Ri to
the function deﬁned by these integrals without Ki. In-
∇i in the following. Proceeding
stead of ∂/∂Ri we write
0 and T = 0, writing simply a(0)
now to the limit R

Here E∗ stands for the complex conjugate of E(k, ω),

f ′ = ∂f /∂k. Furthermore ˜v(0)
stands for
˜v(0)
ij (0, 0, k, ω) and (
ij (R, 0, k, ω))R=0, respectively.
Starting from (38) for b(0)
ijk(R, T ) we proceed analo-
gously. Since, however, bijk is connected with the deriva-
tives of B we replace [E]
simply by
their values at K = 0 and Ω = 0, that is, ignore any

·

those given in [2].

E. Calculation of E (1)

ij and b(1)

Let us now consider E (1) and the corresponding con-
tributions a(1)
ijk to aij and bijk. E (1) is a sum of
three terms, the ﬁrst one linear and homogeneous in Ω
and the second and third ones linear and homogeneous
in W or D, respectively. Then E (1) and likewise a(1)
ij
and b(1)
ijk are sums of three terms, which are again linear
and homogeneous in Ω, W and D. We denote the cor-
ij , a(W )
responding contributions to a(1)
,
a(D)
ij
We may calculate the latter quantities in the same way
as we did it with a(0)
ijk. Unfortunately the results
are rather bulky. Some simpliﬁcation is possible if we
split ˜v(0)
ij

into its symmetric and antisymmetric part,

V. DISCUSSION

A. Assumptions and approximations

Our results have been gained with of some assump-
tions and approximations. As usual it has been generally
assumed that electromotive force E depends in the linear
and homogeneous form (4) on B. The only additional
assumption introduced in Section 3, just for the sake of
simplicity, is the linearity of E in the angular velocity Ω
and the gradient ∇U of the mean velocity, that is, some
smallness of the Coriolis force and the shear in the mean
motion. In Section IV, however, some kind of second–
order correlation approximation (SOCA) has been intro-
duced. As long as only results are considered which are
independent of Ω and ∇U , our procedure corresponds to
the traditional second–order correlation approximation;

satisﬁed. These conditions are roughly described at the
end of Section IV A.

B. Former results

There is a series of former results for situations covered
by our assumptions. We refer in particular to those in
the early works by Steenbeeck et al.
[28], Krause et al.
[1], R¨adler [29], further to those by Vainsthein et al. [7],
R¨udiger et al.
[9]. As far as
[8] and Kichatinov et al.
these results are given in a form that allows a detailed
comparison our results are in satisfying agreement with
most of them. We note that in the calculations by Steen-
beck et al.
[28], which revealed the α–eﬀect, due to an
incorrect assumption on the velocity correlation tensor
the Ω
J–eﬀect does not occur. The latter was found
×
only later [29].

We also point out the recent papers by R¨adler, Klee-
orin and Rogachevskii [10] (referred to as RKR03 in the
following) and by Rogachevskii and Kleeorin [14] (re-
ferred to as RK03).
In both of them an approach is
used, which is aimed to go beyond the second–order cor-
relation approximation by taking into account higher–
order correlations of u and b at least in some crude way.
This approach was suggested by the τ –approximation of

10

turbulence theory. Unfortunately, there is no parame-
ter range in which it completely reproduces the results
for the mean–ﬁeld coeﬃcients obtained with the second–
order correlation approximation; see [30]. Possibly the
assumptions of this approach, which rely on a devel-
oped turbulence with high hydrodynamic and magnetic
Reynolds numbers, Re and Rm, exclude the assumptions
used in the second–order correlation approach. Never-
theless some of the ﬁndings of the τ –approximation ap-
proach are of interest for the following.

C. New ﬁndings concerning the α, γ and β–eﬀects

It is well known that an inhomogeneous turbulence at
a rotating body gives rise to an α–eﬀect. In this case the
essential construction elements of the tensor α are the
vectors g and Ω describing the gradient in the turbu-
lence intensity and the Coriolis force. Our results show
in agreement with those by RK03 that even in the ab-
sence of a Coriolis force the combination of inhomoge-
neous turbulence, that is non-zero g, and a gradient of
the mean velocity, ∇U , leads to an α–eﬀect. This is per-
haps less surprising if the gradient of the mean velocity
corresponds to a rotation. Then the role of Ω in the ten-
sor α is played by W . It is however quite remarkable
that, again in combination with inhomogeneous turbu-
lence, also the symmetric part of the mean velocity gra-
dient, D, which corresponds to a deformation, leads to
an α–eﬀect. This contribution to α has however some
peculiarity, in particular its trace is equal to zero [21].

In all models of α2 or αω dynamos considered so far
the contributions to the α–eﬀect depending on the shear
of the mean ﬂow have been ignored.
It remains to be
investigated how they modify the behavior of such dy-
namos, in particular that of an αω dynamo in the case
of very strong diﬀerential rotation.

It is also known that the γ–eﬀect, which describes a
transport of mean magnetic ﬂux and occurs primarily as
a consequence of a gradient of the turbulence intensity,
is modiﬁed by the Coriolis force, that is, the vector γ
contains a part with Ω. Our results show in agreement
with RK03 that γ possesses also contributions with both
parts of the mean velocity gradient ∇U , that is, with W
and D.

In mean–ﬁeld electrodynamics instead of the molecular
magnetic diﬀusivity η the mean–ﬁeld diﬀusivity η + β(0)
occurs. More generally spoken, the tensor β has to be
added to the isotropic molecular diﬀusivity tensor. It is
clear from simple symmetry considerations and can also
be seen in RKR03 and in RK03 that there are no con-
tributions to β depending on Ω or W as long as we
restrict ourselves to linearity in these quantities. We
have found however, again in agreement with RK03, that
there is a contribution proportional to the symmetric
part of the mean velocity gradient ∇U , that is to D.
The mean–ﬁeld diﬀusivity, and so the mean–ﬁeld con-
ductivity, becomes anisotropic as a consequence of the

q is large.

deforming mean motion described by D.

D. New ﬁndings concerning the δ and κ–eﬀects

Since β(0) is always positive it raises the threshold of a
dynamo. Interestingly enough the mean–ﬁeld diﬀusivity
tensor need not to be positive deﬁnite, and the β–eﬀect
may then well support a dynamo, see [21].

Proceeding to the δ and κ–eﬀects we mention ﬁrst that
already in the case of a homogeneous turbulence at a ro-
tating body, that is, subject to the Coriolis force, con-
tributions to the mean electromotive force proportional
to Ω

As long as δ(Ω) + (1/2)κ(Ω) is independent of position
the last term on the right–hand side is without interest
for the induction equation. Then δ(Ω) and κ(Ω)–eﬀect
act, apart from the signs, in the same way, and we speak
for short of the Ω
J–eﬀect only. We recall that the
Ω
J –eﬀect, even in the absence of any α–eﬀect, but
in combination with diﬀerential rotation, is capable of
dynamo action, see [23–26, 31] and RKR03.

Our above results show that besides the Ω

J–eﬀect
also an analogous W
J–eﬀect exists, which occurs even
in the absence of the Coriolis force. This eﬀect and the re-
lated ones have already been considered by Urpin [11, 12]
and extensively studied in RK03. However, details of
the results by Urpin seem to be incorrect, and those of
RK03 do not agree with ours, which is a consequence of
the fact that the τ –approximation mentioned above was
used instead of the second–order correlation approxima-
tion. Analogous to (59) we have

Diﬀerent from the situation with the δ(Ω) and κ(Ω)–
eﬀects, the δ(W ) and κ(W )–eﬀects are accompanied by

the β(D) and κ(D)–eﬀects. Apart from the case in which
U corresponds to a rigid–body rotation, together with
W also D is unequal to zero so that the β(D) and κ(D)–
eﬀects indeed occur. This makes the comparison between
the eﬀects working with Ω and those working with W
more complex. Note that in contrast to the signs of α(Ω)
and α(W )
and of γ(Ω) and γ(W ), those
of δ(Ω) and δ(W ) diﬀer; with κ(Ω) and κ(W ) the situation

Analogously to the Ω

J–dynamo an W

J–dynamo
was proposed in RK03, working with the induction eﬀects
of turbulence discussed here, which are due to a mean
shear, and the induction eﬀect due to the shear alone.
In a simple model in Cartesian geometry, using results
for δ(W ), κ(W ), β(D) and κ(D) obtained with the help
of the τ –approximation, indeed growing B were found.
Recently R¨udiger et al. [32] pointed out that this model
does not work as a dynamo with δ(W ), κ(W ), β(D) and
κ(D) as found in the second–order correlation approxi-
mation. Our consideration in Appendix C conﬁrms this
ﬁnding. We stress that our negative conclusion apply
only to a simple model of the W
J dynamo and to the
range of validity of the second–order correlation approxi-
mation. It remains to be checked whether this applies to
other models, too. In cylindrical or spherical geometry
the Ω
J eﬀects occur always simultane-
ously. The question of a pure W
J dynamo does not
appear.

vanishing shear. The only non–zero components of W

Clearly δ grows monotonically with ν.
δmax, is given by

(C1)

We refrain here from discussing the case δ′(k2
z) >
1, in which the neglect of higher–order derivatives of B
in E could be questionable. Under these assumption a
dynamo can only exist if δ is positive.

x + k2

According to our results (49) and (B1) for δ(W ), κ(W ),

δ(D) and κ(D) we have

δ =

With an integration by parts with respect to ω this turns
into

It seems reasonable to assume that ω∂W/∂ω
δmax can never be positive. Consequently δ is never pos-
itive, and a W
J dynamo as considered above can not
work.

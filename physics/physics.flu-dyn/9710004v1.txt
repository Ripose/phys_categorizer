Short title: Relativistic imperfect ﬂuid

Introduction

Many physical systems may be approximately regarded as perfect ﬂuids. A perfect ﬂuid is deﬁned
[1] as having at each point a velocity ~v , such that an observer moving with this velocity sees the
ﬂuid around him as isotropic. This will be the case if the mean free path between collisions is
small compared with the scale of lengths used by the observer. But one often has to deal with
somewhat imperfect ﬂuids, in which the pressure or velocity vary appreciable over distances of
the order of a mean free path, or over times of the order of a mean free time, or both.

Numerical methods to solve the hydrodynamical equations have been discussed for instance
in [2]. Any attempt to solve numerically the relativistic hydrodynamics equations is hardly
discouraged by the puzzle of choosing the rest frame; this situation leads us to acausal and
instable solutions [3].

It is therefore of interest to use diﬀerent methods that are directly related to the solutions of the
equations of the relativistic ﬂuid dynamics. Important information may be achieved using the Lie
symmetry group of the covariant relativistic hydrodynamics equations. Symmetry analysis is one
of the systematic and accurate ways to obtain solutions of diﬀerential equations. The power of this
technique consists in the possibility to explore the properties of physical systems like the symmetry
structure and the invariants and then solving the corresponding reduced diﬀerential equations.
Interesting systems were successfully studied using this approach for example [4, 5].
In [6] we
have already investigate a particular simple form of the energy-momentum tensor conservation
equation.

In the next

section we brieﬂy discuss

the
ultrarelativistic approximation and the ﬁnal form of the energy-momentum tensor conservation
equations. In Sec. 3 we address the symmetry group of transformations and its Lie algebra. Sec.
4 is devoted to integrability conditions, invariants and Sec. 5 to group invariant-solutions analysis.
In the last section we present miscellaneous comments and ﬁnal conclusions.

2. Energy-momentum tensor

Relativistic ﬂuid dynamics is well describe by the number of particles N and energy-momentum
tensor Tαβ conservation equations [1]. In the ideal case we have :

Tαβ = pηαβ + (p + ε)UαUβ
Nα = nUα

where ηαβ is the metric tensor, p is the pressure, ε is the energy density, n is the number of particles
density and Uα : (γ ~β, γ) is the 4-velocity ﬁeld.

There are two ways of choosing the rest frame : in the Landau way, Uα is the energy transport
velocity where Ti0 = 0 in the rest frame, while in the Eckart way Uα is the particle transport
velocity where Ni = 0 in the rest frame. The dissipation contribution is introduced by redeﬁning
the energy-momentum and number of particle tensor by adding correction terms :

Tαβ = pηαβ + (p + ε)UαUβ + ∆Tαβ
Nα = nUα + ∆Nα

In the Eckart frame ∆Nα = 0, so the dissipation contribution is present only in the energy-
momentum terms. In the following we choose the Eckart approach. The construction of the most
general dissipation term ∆Tαβ is based on the positivity of the entropy production [1]:

heat-ﬂow vector:

Qα = ∂αT + T U β ∂β Uα

T is the temperature and projection tensor on the hyperplane normal to Uα

Hαβ = ηαβ + Uα Uβ

We identify χ, η, ζ as the coeﬃcients of heat conduction, shear viscosity and bulk viscosity.

The conservation of the energy-momentum tensor Tαβ gives us the main system of equations

that controls the ﬂuid dynamics:

∂αTαβ = 0

A major obstacle in the application of symmetry analysis is the large number of tedious
calculations usually involved. This is the reason to simplify the form of the equations in a
reasonable way. Therefore, we are looking in the energy-momentum conservation equation for
the powers of 4-velocity ﬁeld U because in the ultrarelativistic limit U 3

from ∂α (UαUβU γ∂γT ) we took only the terms with U 3
UαUβU γ∂α∂γT
and in this expression we neglected again terms containing velocity ﬁeld, u or v, at a power smaller
than three. We also consider that the shear viscosity, the bulk viscosity and the heat conduction
are constants; this is a major simpliﬁcation for the symmetry group calculations. In fact they can
be functions of temperature, for example in Weinberg’s book [1], where for a particular kind of
ﬂuid we have

3. Symmetry group of transformations and its Lie algebra

At the end of the last century, Lie considered the invariance of the diﬀerential equations under
the transformation of dependent and independent variables [8]. Lie was able to classify and solve
some types of ordinary as well as partial diﬀerential equations. In recent years, the symmetry
methods have become more attractive, especially in the ﬁeld of nonlinear dynamics [4, 9].

The symmetry group of a system of diﬀerential equations is the largest local group of
transformation acting on the independent and dependent variables of the system with the property
that it transform solutions of the system to other solutions. We restrict our attention to local Lie
group of symmetries, leaving aside problems involving discrete symmetries such as reﬂections.

mention that V6 is a Lorentz transformation.

4. Solvable group and invariants

Because we have the Lie algebra of the system (9) we want to know if the general solution of the
system of diﬀerential equations can be found by quadratures. This thing is possible if the Lie
group is solvable. The group

is solvable if there exists a chain of Lie subgroups

for the compressible ﬂuid.

We use the method of characteristics to compute the invariants of the Lie algebra hopping
that the reduced system, which can be obtained using the invariants of the group, will help us to
solve the system of equations (9). An n-th order diﬀerential invariant of a group G is a smooth
function depending on the independent and dependent variables and their derivatives, invariant
on the action of the corresponding n-th prolongation of G [4].

Suppose that we have the following generator:

Vi = ξi∂x + τi∂t + Φi∂u + Ψi∂v + Γi∂T + Ωi∂p

(24)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(25)

(26)

A local invariant ζ of Vi is a solution of the linear, homogeneous ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential
equation:

Vi(ζ) = ξi∂xζ + τi∂tζ + Φi∂uζ + Ψi∂vζ + Γi∂T ζ + Ωi∂pζ = 0

The classical theory of such equations shows that the general solution of equation (25) can be
found by integrating the corresponding characteristic system of diﬀerential equations, which is

Doing this integration we get, in this case, ﬁve invariants; we now re-express the next generator of
Lie algebra in terms of these ﬁve invariants and then we perform another integration. We continue
this calculation until we re-express and integrate the last generator; at this point we obtain a set
of invariants that represent the system of independent invariants of this group. The system of
invariants can be used to reduce the order of the original equations - constructing the reduced
order system of equations. Doing this one can hope to ﬁnd simple equations that can be integrated
(for example [4]).

Unfortunately our system of independent invariants is not so friendly and we can’t simplify
the form of the equations. We do not present here the invariants because of their unpleasant form
and specially because they are useless in this particular application; the only important thing
is that one of these invariants is u2
v2, which means that the unitarity of the velocity ﬁeld is
preserved.

−

This method will be very well applied on the next section where the invariants are much more
simple and we will use them to ﬁnd the group invariant-solutions. In the next section we will
focus on the incompressible ﬂuid because the absence of the pressure term in our equations will
allow us to obtain analytical solutions by integrating the equations; this is due to the number of
dependent variable which decrease from four (u, v, T and p) to three (u, v and T ).

6. Summary and conclusions

The results of the symmetry group analysis of the energy-momentum tensor conservation equation
for the imperfect ﬂuid ﬂow can be summarized by the following remarks:

The ultrarelativistic limit was implemented in a simple analytical manageable way on the
equations of motion.
The local Lie symmetries of the equations were presented.
The optimal system of transformation was calculated.
We present all the analytical solutions of the reduced system of equations.

The equation that has to be solved numerically was written in the reduced form using the
invariants of the transformation.
These analytical solutions can be very useful for the investigation of diﬀerent physical systems
where the dissipative processes are important. One of them is the relativistic heavy ion
collisions where this kind of relativistic hydrodynamic equations are usually applied [11].

There are some questions that have not been addressed in this paper:

- we have not take into account the pressure and the energy density

- there are also other terms with smaller power of the velocity ﬁeld that were neglected

- only longitudinal expansion was consider and the three-dimensional radial expansion
of the ﬂuid have not been discussed

We will give short answers to the questions mention above:

- for the ﬁrst problem we need a relation between the pressure and the energy density
which can be used for dissipative systems

- the second one will be the goal of our future analyses

- the last one needs numerical codes and a particular physical system with known initial
conditions

We demonstrated the application of the Lie symmetry method on some particular equations
proving that the diﬀerential invariants can help us to simplify very much the task of ﬁnding the
solutions of some given diﬀerential equations.

The Lie group approach in its general form is particularly eﬀective since it furnishes both

general Lie symmetries and all their invariants in a constructive way.

We ﬁnd that the application of this method will give us a straightforward way to decide the
question of integrability. It appears that cases of exact solutions of diﬀerential equations are based
on the use of symmetry of these equations with respect to certain transformations.

We wish to thank L. Anton for fruitful discussions and suggestions. We also thank Prof. M.
Visinescu for his constant support and help.

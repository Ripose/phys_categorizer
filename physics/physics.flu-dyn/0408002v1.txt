ABSTRACT

Laminar natural convection at unity Schmidt number over a horizontal surface with
a weak normal velocity at the wall is studied using an integral analysis. To charac-
terise the strength of the blowing, we deﬁne a non-dimensional parameter called the
blowing parameter. After benchmarking with the no blowing case, the eﬀect of the
blowing parameter on boundary layer thickness, velocity and concentration proﬁles
is obtained. Weak blowing is seen to increase the wall shear stress. For blowing
parameters greater than unity, the diﬀusional ﬂux at the wall becomes negligible
and the ﬂux is almost entirely due to the blowing.

Fluid motion driven by an indirectly induced pressure gradient normal to the direction of the

density potential diﬀerence is termed as indirect natural convection [1; 2]. An example is natural
convection occurring over a horizontal heated surface. At large Grashoﬀ numbers, the ﬂow is of

boundary layer type , and can be described by similarity solutions [3; 4]. Such boundary layers

could form over a porous surface with blowing at the surface, the eﬀect of which on the behavior of

the boundary layer is not obvious. Previous investigations on the eﬀect of blowing on indirect free

convection boundary layers were conducted by Clarke & Riley [5] and Gill et.al. [3] using similarity

Introduction

analysis of the boundary layer equations. The boundary layer equations admit similarity solutions
only for a restrictive and interdependent spatial distribution of wall velocity and density potential.

Hence, the scope of these solutions is limited. We study indirect natural convection boundary

layers for unity Schmidt(or Prandtl) number ﬂuids, when a weak normal velocity is imposed at

the wall. The wall velocity and density potential are not functions of horizontal distance. The

imposed velocities are considered to be weak in the sense that they are of the order of vertical

characteristic velocity in the boundary layer when no blowing is present. An integral method is

used to obtain approximate solutions to the boundary layer equations for blowing velocities and

wall concentrations that are constant in the horizontal direction.

The notation used is plain symbols for nondimensional variables, superscript ˜ for dimensional

variables and subscript c for characteristic scales. The paper is organised in the following manner.

Using the characteristic scales in the problem,the boundary layer equations are derived. Integral

equations are formulated by integrating the boundary layer equations across the boundary layer

thickness, using proﬁles that satisfy the boundary conditions. The solution procedure of the re-
sulting initial value problem is explained and the results are initially compared with the similarity

solutions of Rotem and Classen [4] for no blowing case. The eﬀect of blowing on the boundary

layer thickness, concentration and velocity proﬁles, and mass ﬂux are studied.

Schematic of the problem studied

Consider a ﬂuid having a concentration ˜Co of some species above a horizontal porous surface
maintained at ˜Cw, with ˜Cw < ˜Co. Also, a ﬂuid with concentration ˜Cw ﬂows through the surface
with a normal velocity ˜vw. (The problem is equivalent to natural convection over a heated plate
with blowing, with ˜Cw representing the wall temperature and ˜Co the temperature of the ambient.)
The geometry of the problem studied along with the variables used are shown in Figure (1). ˜u, ˜v
are the velocity components in the ˜x, ˜y directions, and the boundary layer thickness is ˜δ(˜x).The
wall velocity is considered to be independent of the density potential.

Let the characteristic length scales in the horizontal and vertical directions be xc = L, and
yc = δc, a characteristic boundary layer thickness. L is taken as the horizontal dimension of the

surface. Let uc and vc denote the characteristic horizontal and vertical velocities, pc the character-
istic pressure and cc = ˜Co − ˜Cw = ∆ ˜C the characteristic concentration diﬀerence.

The Blowing parameter Vw is the non-dimensional normal velocity at the wall. The blowing
parameter also shows the condition for similarity of the boundary layers in the presence of a weak
blowing. When the normal velocity at the wall has a dependence of ˜vw ∼ ˜x−2/5 the boundary
condition become independent of ˜x and a similarity solution can be obtained. The normalised

terms in the boundary layer equations are of order one. Hence these approximate equations can

Integral Formulation

Consider a steady laminar indirect natural convection boundary layer with a weak blowing that

could be described by the boundary layer equations (3) - (8). Integrating (3) from the surface to

δ(x) and applying the boundary conditions, we get the non dimensional integral mass conservation

equation as

δ(x)

d
dx Z
0

u dy + vδ − Vw = 0

where, vδ = ˜vδ/vc is the non-dimensional entrainment velocity at the edge of the boundary layer.
The non-dimensional integral x momentum equation is obtained by integrating the equation ob-

tained after multiplying (3) by u and subtracting (4).

The terms in the above equation represent convection by the horizontal velocity and entrainment

from ambient, the diﬀusive ﬂux at the wall and the blowing ﬂux at the wall respectively. The

concentration proﬁle is approximated by the function,

f (η, a) = c = (1 − η)2 (1 + a η)

of blowing. We need to satisfy the boundary conditions (7) and (8), ie. u(0, b) = 0, u(1, b) =

0, and ˙u(1, b) = 0, and the condition obtained from the x-momentum equation at the wall,

Equations

(23) and (24) needs three initial conditions δ(0), δ′(0), and b(0) for solution as
an initial value problem. We assume that as x → 0 the boundary layer behaves similar to the

case with no blowing. This is equivalent to assuming an inﬁnitesimal distance where no blowing
eﬀects are present. Hence, we use the values of δ(ǫ) = 0.0179, δ′(ǫ) = 6369.7 and b(ǫ) = 0.2358,
where ǫ = 10−6, as calculated from the similarity solutions of Rotem and Classen [4]as the initial
conditions. It was found that the solution was insensitive to changes in initial conditions up to an

order magnitude from the above conditions. The NDSolve routine of MATHEMATICA was used

to numerically solve (23) and (24) simultaneously.

Results and Discussion

The results are initially compared with similarity solutions for the no blowing case by Rotem
and Classen [4]. The integral analysis gives δ(x) ∼ x2/5, same as that obtained in the similarity
solution. The boundary layer thickness δ in the integral analysis is equal to the thickness at which
c = 0.05 in the solution of Rotem and Classen [4]. Figure (2(a)) compares the x dependence of

the non dimensional boundary layer thickness δ with that of Rotem and Classen [4].Figures (2(b))

those from the similarity solution. Considering the approximate nature of integral methods, the

comparison is satisfactory.

Figure (3(a)) shows the eﬀect of blowing on the boundary layer thickness. As expected, higher

blowing results in larger boundary layer thickness; the increase in total added ﬂuid increases the
boundary layer thickness. The concentration proﬁles at x = 0.5 for diﬀerent blowing parameters

are shown in Figure (3(b)). The reduction in the gradient of concentration at the wall shows that

the diﬀusive ﬂux decreases with increase in the blowing parameter.

The major eﬀect of the change in concentration proﬁle shape is on the pressure distribution.

The motion pressure outside the boundary layer is zero. The motion pressure within the boundary

layer is given by ˜p(˜y, ˜x) = −ρgβ
in the boundary layer due to blowing results in larger value of ˜Co − ˜c. This results in a larger
favourable horizontal pressure diﬀerence with the outside motion pressure than in the case of

without blowing, resulting in larger velocities. This could be observed in Figure (4(a)) shows the non

dimensional horizontal velocity distribution for diﬀerent blowing parameters at x=0.5. Figure 4(b)

shows the variation of horizontal pressure gradient at the wall as a function of horizontal distance for

increasing value of the blowing parameter. The pressure gradient was calculated using the relation
d˜p
( ˜Co − ˜c)d˜y. The increased amounts of lighter ﬂuid in the boundary layer has
d˜x = −ρgβ d
the eﬀect of making the horizontal pressure gradient at the wall more favourable. This increases d˜u

at the wall and results in increased wall shear stresses with blowing. This behaviour is in contrast

to what is observed in a shear boundary layer with blowing. For example, in the case of the Blasius

boundary layer, blowing reduces the wall shear stress. The vertical characteristic velocity in the
boundary layer is δc

Therefore, the vertical momentum from blowing velocities of the order of vc ie, Vw ∼ O(1), doesn’t

Eﬀect of blowing on (a)horizontal velocity proﬁle and (b)horizontal pressure gradient at the wall

seem to be suﬃcient to cause a change in the near wall linearity of the horizontal velocity proﬁle.

For the current range of blowing parameters investigated, the major eﬀect seems to be due to

increase in motion pressure, which increases the horizontal velocities, and the wall shear stress.

The total mass ﬂux of the species into the boundary layer is

The variation of non-dimensional diﬀusive ﬂux over the length of the boundary layer is shown
in Figure(5) . Blowing reduces the diﬀusive ﬂux. Note that when Vw > 1, except very near the
leading edge, the diﬀusive ﬂux is an order lower than the blowing ﬂux, which is equal to Vw.

Figure (6) shows the longitudinally averaged blowing and diﬀusive ﬂuxes as a function of Vw.
The total ﬂux is also shown in the ﬁgure. As pointed above, the mean diﬀusive ﬂux drops with
Vw. At Vw = 3, the diﬀusive ﬂux is about 1
3 rd the diﬀusive ﬂux at no blowing. The blowing ﬂux
increases linearly with the blowing parameter, and at Vw = 3, the blowing ﬂux is about ﬁfteen
times the diﬀusive ﬂux, and about 5 times the no blowing ﬂux. The variation of the ratio of the

total ﬂux with blowing to the ﬂux without blowing (

) could also be noticed from Figure (6).

For example, the ﬂux with Vw=1 is double the ﬂux with no blowing. To take a speciﬁc example,

this means that at a commonly encountered GrL = 106 in water, blowing velocities of the order
of 1 mm/s doubles the ﬂux from the no blowing case. Hence, weak blowing increases the ﬂux

appreciably over the corresponding no blowing ﬂux.

Conclusions

The integral analysis developed in this paper is used to study the eﬀects of weak blowing on

indirect laminar natural convection boundary layers. The blowing velocity and wall concentration

are constant along the wall. The analysis is subject to the assumptions of small δ/L(large Grashoﬀ

numbers), unity Schmidt(or Prandtl) numbers and blowing velocities of the same order as the ver-

tical characteristic velocities due to free convection in the boundary layer. Approximate solutions

were obtained by numerically solving the integrated boundary layer equations. Following are the

major conclusions from the study: (a) As expected, the boundary layer thickness increases with

blowing (Figure 3(a)). (b) Weak blowing increases the horizontal velocities in the boundary layer,

resulting in the wall shear stress also increasing with blowing (Figure 4(a)). (c) The concentration

gradient at the wall and thus the diﬀusive ﬂux reduces with increase in the blowing parameter
(Figure 3(b)). (d) For Vw > 1, the ﬂux due to advection caused by blowing becomes the predomi-
nant contribution to the total ﬂux and hence the total ﬂux shows a linear dependence on Vw. (e)
Comparison of total ﬂux with that in the case of no blowing show that a weak blowing results in

considerable increase in ﬂux (Figure 6).

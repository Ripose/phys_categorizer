Abstract: With help of direct calculation, it is revealed that an essential
concept in deriving the Boltzmann collisional operator, the scattering cross
section in the laboratory frame, cannot be well deﬁned. Along this line, it
is suggested that the collisional operator, as well as the entire Boltzmann
equation, should be reconsidered.

The Boltzmann equation is the ﬁrst kinetic equation arising from the
attempt of physicists to describe the dynamical behavior of gases in terms
of microscopic basic rules. The equation has entered into physics textbooks
and served as a model for other kinetic equations[1][2].

Historically speaking, the Boltzmann equation was strongly criticized
by Boltzmann’s contemporaries and successors. As a subject of long and
hot debate it involved a great number of scientists and philosophers. The
main reason for having such debate was simply related to the fact that
Boltzmann explicitly employed the time reversibility of Newton’s law to
derive his equation while his equation itself appeared to be time-irreversible.
Even today, when the equation is considered as a “basic” equation of classical
physics, many physicists do feel uncomfortable about the paradox involved
(though there are no many discussions in the main literature due to a lack
of new developments).

In setting up a new kinetic approach[3], called the path-integral ap-
proach, one employed, as the ﬁrst choice, the Boltzmann method to treat
collisions; to one’s surprise, it was found that the Boltzmann method in-
volved conceptual and computational diﬃculties. In this paper, we report
on what emerged from our research. In order to avoid controversy, we will
make our discussion as mathematical as possible.

Let’s recall key points in the derivation of the Boltzmann collisional
operator. Firstly, consider that two molecules with the same mass collide
with each other. If we denote their velocities before the collision by v1 and
v2, the center-of-mass velocity and relative velocity of them are respectively

c = (v1 + v2)/2, u = v1 − v2.

Similarly, after the collision we have

c′ = (v′

1 + v′

2)/2, u′ = v′

1 − v′
2.

The conservation laws in classical mechanics imply

c′ = c |u′| = |u| = u.

(1)

(2)

(3)

The direction of u′ is also calculable in classical mechanics if more informa-
tion, such as the impact parameter of the collision, is given[4]. According
to textbooks of statistical mechanics[1], the scattering cross section ¯σ in the
laboratory frame is deﬁned in such a way that

¯σ(v1, v2 → v′

1, v′

2)dv′

1dv′

2

(4)

2

represents the number of molecules per unit time (per unit ﬂux of type 1
molecules incident upon a type 2 molecule) emerging after scattering with
respective ﬁnal velocities between v′
2 and
v′
2. Similarly, the scattering cross section in the center-of-mass frame
is deﬁned so that

1 and between v′

1 and v′

1 + dv′

2 + dv′

σ(Ω)dΩ

(5)

represents the number of type 1 molecules per unit time emerging after
scattering within the range dΩ where Ω is the solid angle between u and u′.
The two cross sections are related to each other by

Z σ(Ω)dΩ = Zv

Zv

′
2

′
1

¯σ(v1, v2 → v′

1, v′

2)dv′

1dv′
2.

(6)

Now, consider collisions between molecules in a Boltzmann gas. For a given
volume drdv1 in the position-velocity phase space (µ-space), the decrease of
molecules within the time interval dt is

Zv2,v

′

1,v

′
2

dt[uf (v2)dv2][f (v1)drdv1 ¯σ(v1, v2 → v′

1, v′

2)dv′

1dv′

2],

(7)

where the ﬁrst square bracket is the relative ﬂux of type 2 molecules, the
second square bracket represents the total cross section of type 1 molecules.
The increase of molecules is similarly expressed by

Zv2,v

′

1,v

′
2

dt[uf (v′

2)dv′

2][f (v′

1)drdv′

1 ¯σ(v′

1, v′

2 → v1, v2)]dv1dv2.

By adopting the reversibility of the collisions

¯σ(v1, v2 → v′

1, v′

2) = ¯σ(v′

1, v′

2 → v1, v2)

(8)

(9)

and making use of (6), the net increase of molecules in the given volume
drdv1 within the time interval dt becomes

dtdrdv1 Zv2,Ω

[f (v′

1)f (v′

2) − f (v1)f (v2)]uσ(Ω)dΩdv2.

(10)

In the standard collisionless theory, the net increase per unit time and per
unit phase volume is recognized as

df
dt

=

∂f
∂t

+ v1 ·

∂f
∂r

+

F
m

·

∂f
∂v1

= 0.

(11)

3

By assuming (10) to be a correction term to (11), the Boltzmann equation
is obtained as

∂f
∂t

+v1 ·

∂f
∂r

+

F
m

·

∂f
∂v1

= Zv2,Ω

[f (v′

1)f (v′

2)−f (v1)f (v2)]uσ(Ω)dΩdv2. (12)

Though the derivation outlined above seems quite stringent, there exist

several hidden loopholes that actually ruin its foundation.

1 is speciﬁed, specifying dv′

The immediate concern is with the validity of the deﬁnition of scattering
cross section in the laboratory frame, namely ¯σ in (4). Fig. 1 sketches a
situation in that a number of molecules with the velocity v1 collide with a
molecule with the velocity v2. The spread of the scattered molecules is due to
the fact that colliding molecules involve diﬀerent impact parameters. There
are two issues worth special attention. One is that there exists an overspec-
iﬁcation in the deﬁnition (4): after dv′
2 is in fact
unnecessary and also misleading, in view of equations (1)-(3). The other
is that the scattered molecules do not spread out over a three-dimensional
velocity volume (as the deﬁnition suggests), instead they spread out over
a two-dimensional surface in the velocity space. Fig. 2 illustrates that the
two-dimensional surface, referred to as the accessible surface hereafter, is a
spherical shell with diameter u. The second issue indicated above presents
serious diﬃculty in the following sense. If the velocity volume element dv′
1
in (4) is chosen to be one like a tall-and-slim cylindrical box, as shown in
Fig. 3a, the value of ¯σ tends to zero. Whereas, if the volume element is like
a short-and-fat cylindrical box, see Fig. 3b, the value of ¯σ tends to inﬁnity.
For purposes of this paper, we evaluate the deﬁned scattering cross section
on the assumption that the volume element dv′
1 is a spherical ball shown in
Fig. 3c (rather common in one’s mental picture). It is easy to see that the
value of ¯σ can, in the situation, be expressed by

¯σ =

¯σdv′
dv′

1(dv′
2)
2)
1(dv′

=

ρπa2
4πa3/3

=

3ρ
4a

,

(13)

where ρ is the molecular density on the accessible surface (per unit ﬂux of
type 1 molecules) and a is the radius of the spherical ball dv′
1. Equation
(13) indicates that the value of the cross section approaches inﬁnity if ρ is
ﬁnite and a → 0.

Since the scattering cross section ¯σ in the laboratory frame, as revealed
above, depends on the shape and size of chosen volume element in the mea-
surement, and since it takes a value equal to either zero or inﬁnity, it cannot
be considered as a well-deﬁned quantity.

A question may now come to one’s mind. Is it possible that the Boltz-
mann collisional operator can be derived without recourse to the cross sec-
tion discussed above? To give an answer to this question, we will, following
the spirit of the standard approach, make a direct calculation concerning
the net change rate of molecules in a phase volume element drdv1. Since all
the collisions take place in terms of classical mechanics such calculation can
be done analytically (as well as numerically).

Firstly, the decrease of molecules in the phase volume element is of con-
cern. There are three essential steps that we need to take. At the ﬁrst
step, molecules expressed by f (v1)dv1 and f (v2)dv2 are identiﬁed as two
colliding beams in the laboratory frame. At the second step, the collision
rate between the two beams is formulated in terms of the cross section σ(Ω),
which makes good sense in in the center-of-mass frame. (This type of cross
section is well deﬁned and extensively discussed in textbooks of mechanics.)
Without any diﬃculty, the number of collisions related to the two molecular
beams is formulated as

ZΩ

dt[uf (v2)dv2][drdv1f (v1)σ(Ω)dΩ].

(14)

At the third step, integrating expression (14) over the velocity v2 yields the
number of interest

dtdrdv1 Zv2,Ω

f (v1)f (v2)uσ(Ω)dΩdv2.

(15)

Comparing it with the second term of (10) tells us that we have not obtained
anything new.

Then, we take the same manner to calculate the increase of molecules in
the given phase volume element. It is to be noted that we need to take four,
instead of three, steps to do the job. At the ﬁrst step, molecules expressed
by f (v′
2 are similarly identiﬁed as two colliding beams in
the laboratory frame. At the second step, the collisions are also investigated
in the center-of-mass frame and the number of collisions related to the two
beams is similarly formulated as

1 and f (v′

2)dv′

1)dv′

ZΩ

dt[uf (v′

2)dv′

2][drdv′

1f (v′

1)σ(Ω)dΩ].

(16)

At the third step, we try to determine what fraction of the scattered molecules
enter the given phase volume element drdv1. The task, if deﬁned as that
in the standard approach, can be accomplished in the following way. Since

5

the scattered molecules spread out over a spherical shell S with diameter
u = |v′

2|, we may introduce a probability density as

1 − v′

P (Ω) ≡ lim
∆S→0

1
n

∆n
∆S

with

Z P (Ω)dΩ = 1

(17)

where n is the total number of type 1 scattered molecules and Ω is the solid
angle of the velocity u with respect to u′. If needed, P deﬁned as above can
be calculated in terms of classical mechanics; for the purpose here it suﬃces
to ﬁnd its value to be ﬁnite. By assuming that dv1 is a small spherical ball
with radius a, the number of molecules entering the volume element due to
the collisions of the two beams is, by following (16),

ZΩ

P (Ω)(πa2)dtdrf (v′

1)f (v′

2)uσ(Ω)dΩdv′

1dv′
2.

(18)

At the fourth step, the expression above is integrated over the two, instead
1 and v′
of one, velocities v′
2 and the increase of molecules within the phase
volume drdv1 during dt is

1
2

dtdr(πa2)Zv

′

1,v

′

2,Ω

P (Ω)f (v′

1)f (v′

2)uσ(Ω)dΩdv′

1dv′
2.

(19)

The factor 1/2 in the last expression is due to the fact that each of
molecules has been taken into account twice. By virtue of dv1 = 4πa3/3,
the increase of molecules per unit time and per unit phase volume becomes

3

8a Zv

′

1,v

′

2,Ω

P (Ω)f (v′

1)f (v′

2)uσ(Ω)dΩdv′

1dv′
2.

(20)

Note that the integration in (20) can regularly be performed, but the value
of (20) itself is not well deﬁned. As a → 0, it tends to inﬁnity.

Apart from assuming a to be relatively small, the formulation above,
from (16) to (20), introduces no approximation, and the encountered diﬃ-
culty cannot be removed by any kinds of technical treatments.

We may then wonder why the diﬃculty, seeming quite obvious, did not
emerge long ago. The reason probably lies in the fact that the collisional
eﬀect has to be formulated in the six-dimensional phase space and this space
is in many situations too abstract to visualize and comprehend. As the
mental grip loosens, “planes”, “vectors”, “ﬂuxes” and “collisions”, which
are once clear and helpful concepts in the usual spaces, become obscure and

6

even misleading. From this point of view, we can ﬁnd that more treatments
in textbooks are questionable.

In deriving the standard Boltzmann equation, the collisional operator is
considered as a correction term to the collisionless Boltzmann equation. In
this context, we are supposed to focus on a “speciﬁc” phase volume element
and investigate how the molecular number within it varies in the absence
and presence of collisions. There are two kinds of phase volume elements
employed by textbooks, neither of them is free from troublesome issues.

The ﬁrst kind of phase volume element is that associated with a moving
molecule in µ-space. It is rather well-known that, in the absence of collisions
the distribution function keeps invariant along the molecule’s path

f (t0, r0, v0) = f (t, r, v).

(21)

That is to say, if we have a six-dimensional deﬁnite-size small box and let it
move with a molecule, the number of molecules in this box will not change
with respect to time, as shown in Fig. 4.
If this picture were adopted
consistently, we should, in constructing the collisional operator, formulate
the molecular number in this moving box. Let alone whether it can be
accomplished or not, the task outlined above has never been tried.

The second kind of phase volume element is that located at a station-
ary point in µ-space. In order to formulate the net change of molecules in
such a six-dimensional box, it is of necessity to deﬁne ﬂuxes through the
“walls”. Noting that the walls under consideration are ﬁve-dimensional hy-
persurfaces, we must sense the involved diﬃculty. For instance, the textbook
treatment employs ˙x = vx to deﬁne the ﬂux along the x-direction; but Fig.
5 illustrates that in the six-dimensional phase space this “velocity” is per-
pendicular to the two-dimensional surface ∆y∆z not to the ﬁve-dimensional
hypersurface

∆vx∆vy∆vz∆y∆z,

(22)

since vx is among the ﬁve dimensions of the hypersurface. As a matter of
fact, we do not know anything that can be deﬁned as a ﬂux through the
hypersurface.

The standard approach takes a convenient way to do its job. In deﬁning
and dealing with ﬂuxes, only three-dimensional subspaces of the phase space,
the spatial space or the velocity space, exists in the mental picture.
In
formulating collisional eﬀects, only the velocity change per unit time due
to collisions is in one’s mind but the position change per unit time due to

7

collisions is not. In view of these facts, the entire Boltzmann equation should
be reconsidered.

A complete discussion on the arising questions and problems is much
beyond the scope of this brief paper.
In some of our recent papers[5][6],
we make more analyses and try to introduce alternative approaches to the
Boltzmann gas.

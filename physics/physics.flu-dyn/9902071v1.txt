We address the dynamics of a drop with viscosity λη breaking up inside another ﬂuid of viscosity
η. For λ = 1, a scaling theory predicts the time evolution of the drop shape near the point of snap-oﬀ
which is in excellent agreement with experiment and previous simulations of Lister and Stone. We
also investigate the λ dependence of the shape and breaking rate.

When a ﬂuid droplet breaks, as shown in Figure 1, a singularity develops due to the inﬁnite curvature at the
point of snap-oﬀ [1]. Near such a singularity, the axial and radial length scales become vanishingly small, allowing,
independent of initial conditions, a local analysis of the ﬂow equations. Such a separation of scales implies that near
snap-oﬀ the proﬁles should be self-similar: on rescaling by the axial and radial scales the proﬁles near the singularity
should collapse onto a universal curve. [2]

The character of the singularity depends on which terms in the Navier-Stokes equations are dominant at the point
of breakup. If the drop breaks up in vacuum, surface tension,viscous stresses, and inertia are balanced asymptotically,
although the motion may pass through other transient regimes, depending on viscosity [3,4,2,5,6]. In this paper, we
investigate the situation where the viscous eﬀects of the inner and outer ﬂuid are included as are the pressure gradients
produced by the curvature in the surface separating them; the inertial terms are taken to be insigniﬁcant so that
we are in the Stokes regime [7–9]. Assuming that molecular scales are not reached ﬁrst, this is the ﬁnal asymptotic
regime describing ﬂows near snap-oﬀ for any pair of ﬂuids even in the case of arbitrarily low viscosity. This paper
uses experiments, simulations and theory to characterize the self similar approach to snap-oﬀ in this regime.

[FIG. 1 about here.]

We consider the rupture of a ﬂuid of viscosity λη surrounded by another ﬂuid of viscosity η. The interface between
the two ﬂuids has surface tension γ. At a time t∗ before the rupture, dimensional analysis suggests that all length
scales have the form H(λ)γη−1t∗ where H(λ) is a function yet to be determined. Hence, if drop proﬁles near rupture
are rescaled by t∗, they should collapse onto a universal curve, independent of the initial conditions. However, Lister
and Stone [8] noticed that the long-ranged character of the Stokes interaction leads to logarithmic corrections in
the velocity ﬁeld. They simulated equations (1)-(3) below for drops having various unstable initial conditions, and
demonstrated collapse if the logarithmic term was subtracted. (See also Loewenberg et al. [9].)

Herein, we demonstrate that this collapse also works for experiments, and construct a scaling theory to explain
the proﬁle shapes, by incorporating the nonlocal contributions into a local similarity description. Figure 2 shows the
collapse of rescaled proﬁles at λ = 1 for both experiments and numerical simulations using a numerical technique
similar to that of Lister and Stone. They are superimposed on the scaling theory developed below (black line).

[FIG. 2 about here.]

The experiment used 9.5 St Glycerin dripping through 10 St PDMS. The viscosities are large enough that the
experiment is in the Stokes-ﬂow regime even at macroscopic scales. The surface tension γ was measured using the
pendant drop method [10] and the viscosity was measured using calibrated Cannon-Ubbelohde viscometers. We used
a Kodak Motion Corder Analyzer to capture ten thousand frames per second. These images were then analyzed using
an edge-tracing program, and smoothed [11].

In rescaling the experimental proﬁles, we shifted the origin so that the locations of the minima in the proﬁles lined
up. Because the proﬁles were relatively ﬂat along the axial direction there was some uncertainty in the determination
of these minima. We therefore shifted each rescaled proﬁle in the axial, ξ, direction to minimize the cumulative
deviation in H(ξ).

The inset of Figure 2 shows that near snap-oﬀ hmin(t) is a linear function of t∗. By ﬁtting the prefactor of this linear
dependence, we obtain hmin = (0.031 ± 0.008)γη−1t∗, in excellent agreement with the result hmin = 0.0335γη−1t∗
from numerical simulations [8] and the scaling theory constructed below.

Scaling Theory Since the Stokes equation is linear, the ﬂuid surface velocity can be expressed as an integral over

the surface of the ﬂuid-ﬂuid interface. At λ = 1 the equation is [12]

v(S)(z, t) = −γ

κ(z′)J(z, z′)n(z′)dz′,

(1)

Z

where n is the outward normal, κ is the curvature, z is the axial coordinate, and the tensor J is

with r the vector between the two points on the surface, I the identity matrix, and the integration is over the azimuthal
angle θ . Physically, equation (2) represents the response of the surface tension forcing the interface. For unequal
viscosities λ 6= 1, eq. (2) must be amended by an additional term, which accounts for the jump in viscosity. Given
the radial vr and axial vz components of the surface velocity, the interface advances according to

which states that the surface at a given axial position can deform by radial motion and axial advection.

Motivated by the simulations of Lister and Stone [8], we try the similarity ansatz

h(z, t) = vηt∗H(ξ), ξ = v−1

η (z∗/t∗) + b ln t∗ + ξ0,

where z∗ is the axial distance from the singularity, b is a constant, and the factors of vη ≡ γ/η have been inserted
to make H and ξ dimensionless. The shift b ln t∗ in the similarity variable ξ results from the logarithmic divergence
of the axial velocity ﬁeld [8], and ξ0 will be shown to be an arbitrary constant which depends on the boundary
conditions. Since the solution near snap-oﬀ must match onto the outer proﬁle, which varies slowly on the time-scale
t∗ H(ξ) ∼ s±ξ, as ξ → ±∞. Here we deﬁne s− as the slope of the shallow side of the pinch region, which by convention
we place to the left of the minimum, and s+ as the steep slope.

The subtle feature of this problem is the interplay of the local singularity with the nonlocal ﬂuid response from the
Stokes ﬂow. The principal nonlocal eﬀect is that the surface tension force from the cones produces a logarithmically
diverging axial velocity ﬁeld at the pinch point, ξ = 0 [8]. For a local scaling theory, this singularity must be
absorbed. We ﬁx two points ξ′
+ within the linear part of the solution to the left and right of ξ = 0. Splitting
the contributions to the velocity on the surface into a contribution from ξ− < ξ < ξ+ and from the rest of the drop,
and converting to similarity variables, we ﬁnd

where V(S) = (v(S) − b ln t∗ez)/vη and ez is the unit vector along the axial direction. Because of the cones, the
axial component of the J-integral in angular brackets diverges logarithmically as t∗ → 0. For the special choice
−)−1)/4 the singularity cancels and the term in angular brackets remains ﬁnite for
b = −(s+(1 + s2

on λ through s+, s−. The remaining constant in (5) depends on the detailed shape of the drop as well as on the choice

The system (5)-(6) now has to be solved in the limit ξ′

−/t∗ → −∞, for the interval −∞ < ξ < ∞
and with boundary conditions H ∼ ξ as ξ → ∞. Changing the constant ξ0 + b only results in a constant shift
of the similarity function H(ξ). The computation involves solving an integro-diﬀerential equation with a nonlocal
constraint: the parameter b in (5) must be determined self consistently with the solution H(ξ) according to relation
(5). The diﬀerence between this scaling theory and others developed for ﬂuid rupture is that here the parameters in
the similarity equation must be determined self consistently with the solution to the similarity equation.

We solved this system by discretizing H(ξ) in an interval ξ ∈ [−ξin, ξin] and approximated all derivatives and the
integral by second-order formulas. At ξ = −ξin, ξin we demand H ′′ = 0. Using a linear approximation for H outside
the interval [−ξin, ξin], the logarithm is subtracted explicitly. A numerical solution of the full PDE’s provided an
initial condition for Newton’s iteration, which converged in a few steps. The iteration always converges to the same
solution for any given ξ0. The calculation gives H0(λ = 1) = 0.0335, s− = −0.105, s+ = 4.81, where s+,− are the
asymptotic slopes at ±∞. These results are in good agreement with both the simulations of [8] and experiments (Fig.

2). Although the theory has been solved only for λ = 1, by continuity we expect that solutions exist for a range of λ
and that hmin obeys the law hmin = H0(λ)vηt∗.

It is noteworthy that droplet breakup between ﬂuids of equal viscosities is not plagued by the iterated instabilities
found for droplet breakup in vacuum [13]: neither experiments nor simulations observe such instabilities. The reason
for this can be found by stability analysis of the similarity solution, following the same procedure as [14]. The result
is that perturbations around the similarity solution can be ampliﬁed by a factor of ≈ 150, which is much smaller
than the corresponding ampliﬁcation factor for rupture in vacuum, where it is 104.7(t∗)−1.5 [14]. The reasons for the
diﬀerences between the two problems are that (i) For λ = 1 Tomitoka’s formula [15] implies that the maximum linear
growth rate for perturbations is approximately (t∗)−1. On the other hand for λ = ∞, the maximum growth rate is
approximately 5(t∗)−1. (ii) The λ = ∞ problem has a time dependent ampliﬁcation factor because the axial length
scale has a diﬀerent scaling with t∗ than the radial length scale. This implies that the closest a perturbation can be
to the stagnation point depends on t∗, even when expressed in similarity variables.

Arbitrary λ We now extend features of the above results to arbitrary λ. Using Glycerin/water mixtures (1 St
< η < 9.5 St) and silicone oils (1 St < η < 600 St) we were able to cover a range of λ between 0.002 and 30. The
same procedure as used above veriﬁed self-similar data collapse in experiments with 0.02 < λ < 30 [11]. In all these
experiments, the conical proﬁle associated with s− collapsed for all analyzed proﬁles. This corresponds to a time
interval of at least 0.1 seconds prior to and all the way up to the point of snap-oﬀ. This can be seen in Figure 2 for
λ = 1. In contrast, as also seen in that ﬁgure, the conical proﬁle associated with s+ showed a time-dependent collapse
with the region of self-similarity growing as the point of snap-oﬀ is approached. This time dependence changes as we
vary λ, slowing down as λ → 1.

Figure 3 shows the cone angles s±, and the dimensionless breaking rate H0 as a function of λ. As shown by Figs.
3a-b, the cone angles appear to obey a power law over an extended range of λ: s+ ∼ λ0.21±0.05 and s− ∼ λ−0.23±0.07.
(Due to measurement diﬃculties, the range for s− is reduced from that for s+ [11].) Within error, the analyses
performed on both the snap-oﬀ event near the nozzle and the snap-oﬀ event near the bulb lead to the same results.
This agreement implies that the results are robust and independent of small variations in the surrounding ﬂows.
Note that our ﬁndings are in qualitative disagreement with lubrication-type scaling arguments [7,8], which predict
s± ∼ λ−1/2 for the slope on either side of the minimum. On the other hand, the trends in our data are consistent
with recent numerical simulations of the full Stokes equations by Zhang and Lister [19]. This is yet another indication
of the breakdown of one dimensional models in describing the dynamics of two ﬂuid rupture.

[FIG. 3 about here.]

A Simple Theory for H0(λ) follows by noting that (assuming the shape of the drop is slender near hmin) the
maximum rate that the drop can break is given by the maximum linear growth rate Ω(hmin) for a cylinder of uniform
radius hmin. Namely, we have the upper bound

Ω(hmin) >

d
dt (hmin)
hmin

=

t∗ .

(7)

By using Tomotika’s formula [15] for Ω(hmin) with hmin = H0(λ)vηt∗, this equation turns into an upper bound for
H0(λ). This upper bound is compared with the experimental data for H0(λ) in Fig. 3c. All of the data obeys the
bound; moreover, in the range 0.1 < λ < 10 the agreement is nearly exact. Note that while most of the experimental
data (and the upper bound equation (7) can be ﬁt with a power law of exponent −0.53 ± 0.05, a signiﬁcant trend
with an overall negative curvature is observed in the experimental deviations.

The agreement of the experiments with the upper bound in the range 0.1 < λ < 10 is reminiscent of the marginal
stability hypothesis, as formulated for the selection of traveling waves propagating from a stable to an unstable
state [16]. Both experiments and numerical simulations show that the breaking rate is approximately equal to the
growth rate of linear instabilities around a cylinder of radius hmin. The upper bound in equation (7) should apply
to all problems involving singularity formation in a system with a local instability. We have tested this upper bound
on similarity solutions from several other examples including spherically symmetric gravitational collapse [17] and
chemotactic collapse of bacteria [18]; the upper bound is obeyed in each case, giving a reasonable estimate for the
prefactor. Hence, this principle appears to be of rather general applicability.

To conclude, we have (i) constructed a similarity solution for rupture at λ = 1, agreeing with previous numerical
simulations [8]; (ii) shown that experiments agree quantitatively with this similarity solution, both in the form of
the proﬁle and its time dependence; and (iii) presented a simple argument which quantitatively predicts the breaking
rate. Experiments have also shown self-similar behavior for the range 0.02 < λ < 30. There are many unresolved
issues: Among them, there is no solid simple argument for the λ-dependence of the slopes s−, s+. Finally, our results

3

suggest that the scaling (4) holds even in the limit λ → ∞, while a diﬀerent set of scaling exponents is found for a
Stokes ﬂuid breaking up in vacuum (λ = ∞) [4]. In addition, the proﬁles are asymmetric for λ → ∞, as also found
in a recent numerical simulation [20], but are symmetric for breakup in vacuum [4], making this a singular limit.
Preliminary experimental results of an inviscid ﬂuid breaking up in a viscous ﬂuid suggest that the snap-oﬀ shape is
diﬀerent from that in Stokes ﬂow with λ → 0 implying that this limit is singular as well.

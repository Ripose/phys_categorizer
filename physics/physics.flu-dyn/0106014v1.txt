The eﬀects of passive scalar anisotropy on subgrid-scale (SGS) physics and modeling
for Large-Eddy Simulations are studied experimentally. Measurements are performed
across a moderate Reynolds number wake ﬂow generated by a heated cylinder, using
an array of four X-wire and four cold-wire probes. By varying the separation distance
among probes in the array, we obtain ﬁltered and subgrid quantities at three diﬀerent
ﬁlter sizes. We compute several terms that comprise the subgrid dissipation tensor of
kinetic energy and scalar-variance and test for isotropic behavior, as a function of ﬁlter
scale. We ﬁnd that whereas the kinetic energy dissipation tensor tends towards isotropy
at small scales, the SGS scalar-variance dissipation remains anisotropic independent of
ﬁlter scale. The eddy-diﬀusion model predicts isotropic behavior, whereas the nonlinear
(or tensor eddy diﬀusivity) model reproduces the correct trends, but overestimates the
level of scalar dissipation anisotropy. These results provide some support for so-called
mixed models but raise new questions about the causes of the observed anisotropy.

1. Introduction

The statistics and general structure of passive scalars in turbulent ﬂows diﬀer signif-
icantly from those of the turbulent velocity ﬁeld. In particular, conclusive experimental
(e.g. Stewart 1969, Sreenivasan, Antonia & Britz 1979, Mestayer 1982, and Mydlarski
& Warhaft 1998a) and numerical (e.g. Holzer & Siggia 1994) evidence shows that struc-
ture functions and the derivative skewness of the scalar ﬁeld do not follow predictions
from isotropy at inertial and dissipative scales, in the presence of a mean scalar gradient.
In particular, the deviations are thought to be related to “ramp and cliﬀ structures”
and to imply a direct eﬀect of large-scale structures on small-scale structures. The data
relevant to this question has been reviewed by Sreenivasan (1991) and more recently
by Warhaft (2000). Moreover, scalar spectra display a distinctly less universal structure
than velocity spectra. This is manifested both in terms of spectral exponents, as well
as in terms of the dimensionless spectral coeﬃcient cθ. The latter varies from values
near 0.4 in many experiments in the atmospheric surface layer and grid turbulence (see
Sreenivasan 1991, Sreenivasan 1996 and Warhaft 2000) to cθ ∼ 1.8 for other atmospheric
measurements (Antonia, Ould-Rouis, Anselmet & Zhu 1997, and Antonia, Xu & Zhou
1999). From a fundamental point of view, these observations challenge the Kolmogorov
cascade phenomenology for the transfer of scalar-variance from large to small scales. In
the classical phenomenology, the multiplicity of separate “eddy breakdown” events is
assumed to gradually uncouple the small from the large scales, allowing the former to

2

tend to a universal and isotropic structure more or less independent of the large scales.
On the contrary, the scalar-ﬁeld measurements suggest a direct linkage among largest
and smallest scales.

The coupling among scales is an important ingredient in Large-Eddy Simulations
(LES). In LES, the turbulent ﬁelds (velocity and scalar) are decomposed into large and
small (subgrid-scale, SGS) scale contributions by means of a spatial low-pass ﬁlter of
characteristic width ∆. The resulting equations which can be numerically discretized
with mesh-spacing of the order of ∆ require closure of the unresolved momentum ﬂuxes
uj, where a tilde represents ﬁltering at scale ∆) and
(SGS stress tensor, τij ≡
scalar ﬂuxes (e.g. the SGS heat ﬂux, qj ≡
uj where θ is the passive scalar ﬁeld).
The promise of LES is often predicated upon small-scale universality and isotropy, and
g
the absense of a strong coupling across disparate length scales. Hence, the observed
anisotropy of the scalar ﬁeld seems to pose a challenge to the very foundation of LES.
While these deviations from classical phenomenology are now quite well established, little
is known about their impact on the closure problem for LES. The present work quantiﬁes
the implications of small-scale scalar anisotropy on quantities that describe subgrid-scale
physics and directly aﬀect modeling for LES.

As reviewed in Meneveau & Katz (2000), the most important statistical property of
the ﬂuxes τij and qj is how they aﬀect the mean kinetic energy and scalar-variance
budgets of the resolved ﬁelds. Speciﬁcally, their dominant eﬀect is through the kinetic
energy and scalar-variance dissipations that arise from interactions between subgrid and
resolved scales. Therefore, in the present study, we mainly focus on the so-called SGS
Siji (Piomelli et al. , 1991) and scalar-variance dissipation
kinetic energy dissipation −hτij

(cid:1)
and
θ/∂xj are the resolved strain-rate tensor and scalar gradient, respectively.
The SGS dissipation rates represent the ﬂux (cascade) of kinetic energy or scalar-variance
from resolved towards subgrid scales (when positive). When ∆ pertains to the inertial
range, and when the ﬂow is in equilibrium, one expects the mean SGS dissipation to
equal the molecular dissipation rate.

Deviations from isotropy in the context of SGS dissipation can be probed by measuring
Gj i, as a function of scale. The main
Smni and −hqi
the isotropy level of the tensors −hτij
question to be addressed in this work is whether the approach to isotropy (if it exists)
is the same for kinetic energy and scalar-variance dissipation tensors. Another goal is to
test the ability of two popular model classes (eddy diﬀusivity and nonlinear models, see
Meneveau & Katz 2000 for a review) to reproduce the observations. In order to span a
sizeable range of inertial-range ﬁlter scales, a suﬃciently high Reynolds number must be
considered. Hence, this study is based on experimental data (as opposed to DNS which
is limited to small Reynolds numbers). The study is performed in a canonical shear ﬂow,
the heated cylinder wake.

2. Experiment apparatus and ﬂow characteristics

Experiments were performed in the return type Corrsin Wind Tunnel (Comte-Bellot &
Corrsin 1966). A heated smooth cylinder of diameter D = 4.83 cm was located horizon-
tally at the centerline of the test section. The measurement location in the streamwise
direction (x1) was ﬁxed at x1/D = 25. To obtain the ﬁltered and SGS quantities, an
array of four custom-made miniature probes was used. Each probe was composed of one
X-type hot-wire and one I-type cold-wire for the velocities in the x1 − x2 plane and the

Passive scalar anisotropy and LES

temperatures, respectively. Here x2 is the “cross-wake” direction, i.e. perpendicular to
x1 and to the cylinder axis.

The separation distance h between the probes in the cross-wake direction x2 could be
adjusted manually between 5 and 20 mm. Three conﬁgurations (∆ = 2h, with h = 5, 10
and 20 mm) were used in the present study. A 2.5 µm platinum-coated tungsten wire
which had been copper-plated was soldered on to the X-wire prong ends and etched,
yielding an active length-to-diameter ratio of about 200. The wire spacing between the
hot-wires was 0.5 mm. A 0.625 µm silver-coated pure platinum wire for a cold-wire
sensor was soldered on the I-wire prong ends and subsequently etched. To minimize the
low frequency amplitude attenuation, the active length-to-diameter ratio was about 1000
as suggested by Bruun (1995). The separation distance between the cold-wire and its
nearest hot-wire was 0.9 mm so that the thermal eﬀect from the hot-wire on the cold-
wire was negligible. The signals were low-pass ﬁltered at a frequency of 20 kHz and
sampled at fs = 40 kHz. Sampling time was 60 seconds, so the total number of data
points per channel for each measurement location was 2.4 × 106. The array was traversed
across the wake, and data were recorded at 17 discrete cross-wake locations from the
centerline to the wake edge at increments of 14.4 mm.

At the measurement location of x1/D = 25, the mean centerline velocity (UCL) was
13.6 m/s, the defect velocity (Ud = U∞ −UCL) was 4.4 m/s, the defect temperature (θd =
θCL − θ∞) was 0.61 ◦C, and the half-width of the wake was ℓ = 0.08 m. To get the spatial
quantities along the streamwise direction from the temporal data, Taylor’s hypothesis was
invoked. The turbulence intensity of the streamwise velocity at the centerline was about
13.3%. The molecular kinetic energy dissipation at the centerline (ǫCL) was 87 m2s−3,
and the molecular scalar-variance dissipation at the centerline (ǫθCL) was 0.65 ◦C2s−1.
The latter two variables were obtained from (corrected) third-order structure functions
as in Cerutti et al. (2000) and Lindborg (1999). It follows that the Kolmogorov length
scale (η = (ν3/ǫ)1/4) was 0.08 mm, the Taylor micro-scale (λ) was 2.9 mm, and the
Reynolds number based on Taylor micro-scale (Reλ) was 350. The longitudinal integral
scale obtained by integrating up to the ﬁrst zero crossing of the u1 correlation function
was L11 = 0.091 m. Proﬁles of mean velocity, rms velocities, Reynolds shear stress, rms
temperature and heat ﬂux distributions across the wake agreed quite well with results in
the literature (e.g., Matsumura & Antonia 1993 and Kiya & Matsumura 1988).

In the present study, to separate between large and small scales, the box ﬁlter is
applied to the streamwise and cross-wake directions, and the trapezoidal rule is used
for the spatial integrations. The ﬁltering process consists in a discrete approximation
to a two-dimensional box ﬁlter. In the x2 direction, a four point discretization is used
for evaluating the SGS ﬂuxes while a three-point approximation is used for the ﬁltered
derivatives. Filtered velocity and scalar gradients in the x2 direction are evaluated using
ﬁrst-order ﬁnite diﬀerences over a distance h. In the streamwise direction, the box ﬁlter
is approximated using ∆fs/hu1i sampling points and the x1 derivatives are evaluated
using ﬁnite diﬀerences over a distance h. The ﬁltering and error analysis is documented
in Cerutti & Meneveau (2000) and Cerutti et al. (2000).

Figure 1(a) shows a comparison between the longitudinal spectrum E11(κ1) of the u1
component and the longitudinal spectrum E22(κ1) of the u2 component multiplied by
3/4 at the centerline. Here, κ1 is the longitudinal wave number. The three vertical dashed
lines correspond to the ﬁlter sizes of ∆/η =125 (10 mm), 250 (20 mm), 500 (40 mm). All
the ﬁlter sizes are in the inertial range. Since the noise peak in the longitudinal spectrum
of u1 is in the far dissipation region, quite removed from any of the ﬁlter frequencies
and scales of interest in this study, no eﬀort is made to remove the noise by additional
ﬁltering (various attempts such as notch ﬁltering showed no eﬀect on the results). It can

be clearly observed that E11(κ1) ≈ 3
4 E22(κ1) as required by isotropy in the inertial range,
over about one decade of wave numbers. The peak in E22(κ1) at κ1η ∼ 0.003 is due to
the periodic von K´arm´an vortex street behind the cylinder. The frequency of the vortices
is 78.1 Hz, and this gives Strouhal number St (= f D/U∞) = 0.211. The Kolmogorov
constant cK in E11(κ1) = 18
18 (0.56) = 1.71 in the
insert. This value is quite close to the standard value of 1.6 (see review by Sreenivasan
1995) and a similar value of 1.7 was observed by O’Neil & Meneveau (1997). Figure 1(b)
shows the longitudinal spectrum of the temperature Eθθ(κ1). As seen in the premultiplied
spectrum shown in the insert, there is a fairly clear inertial range with a −5/3 slope. This
slope is steeper than those found in the round jet by Tong & Warhaft (1995) and Miller
& Dimotakis (1996), and in several other shear ﬂows reviewed in Sreenivasan (1996). It
is closer to results quoted in Antonia & Pearson (1997), who report a scaling exponent
of 0.65-0.66 for the 2nd-order temperature structure function in the heated cylinder wake
at Reλ = 230, or to the spectra for grid turbulence of Mydlarski & Warhaft (1998b).

The coeﬃcient cθ in Eθθ(κ1) = cθǫθǫ−1/3κ

deduced from this spectrum is about
1.4. It is signiﬁcantly higher than results quoted in Sreenivasan (1996) for high Reynolds
numbers, but is within the range of results from various shear ﬂow measurements reported
in Antonia et al. 1999. As discussed in Sreenivasan (1996), the dissipation measurements
are based on assuming scalar isotropy and are thus subject to considerable uncertainty.
On the other hand, at the centerline we ﬁnd good isotropy (see section 3) which would
seem to support our current estimates of the dissipation and cθ. While the universality
of cθ and spectral exponent is not the main subject of this paper, the scatter of re-
sults certainly supports the view that the scalar spectrum for shear ﬂows at moderate
Reynolds numbers (e.g. Reλ < 1000) depends upon details of the generation of the ﬂow
(Sreenivasan, 1996). Speciﬁcally, it seems that the dependence of the spectral exponent
and prefactor on Reλ is not universal.

Figure 2 shows isotropy ratios of the ﬁltered gradient ﬁelds and of the mean SGS
stresses, for ∆/η = 125. In isotropic conditions, all ratios have to be on the unit line
except hτ12i/hτ11i which should tend to zero with decreasing ﬁlter scale since the fraction
of mean shear stress carried by the SGS scales is expected to vanish when ∆/ℓ → 0. As
can be seen, both the SGS stress and strain-rate ﬁelds are quite isotropic across the
heated wake ﬂow at this scale. For the larger ﬁlter sizes of ∆/η = 250 and 500 (not
shown), the trends are similar to ﬁgure 2 but slightly less isotropic.

are statistically well converged. For example, running averages such as n−1
k=1 qi ˜Gj
did not diﬀer from their global average by more than 6% over the last 80% of data (i.e.
for n ∈ [0.2N, N ] where N = 2.4 · 106). For diﬀerent ﬁlter sizes considered, the SGS
kinetic energy and scalar-variance dissipations are isotropic only towards the centerline
of the wake. Towards the edges of the wake, large anisotropies persist (even though there
the mean shear and mean temperature gradients vanish also). The isotropy ratio of Iu12
at a ﬁxed x2/ℓ in ﬁgure 3(a) clearly increases with the ﬁlter size. However, the isotropy
ratio of the scalar-variance dissipation Iθ shows almost no variation with ﬁlter size for
1 < x2/ℓ < 2, where the scalar gradient in the cross-wake direction, ∂θ

P

n

∂x2 , is large.

The increased anisotropy in the outer regions of the wake (see ﬁgures 3(a) and (b))
is another striking result. The anisotropy may be associated with the highly intermit-
tent character of the ﬂow there. One may wonder whether the anisotropy arises from
a superposition of distinct behaviors in the turbulent and the non-turbulent (outer) re-
gions. Using conditional averaging, O’Neil & Meneveau (1997) already showed that the
conditional averages of the SGS dissipations in the non-turbulent regions were negligible
compared to those in the turbulent regions. The implication was that the global aver-
ages of dissipation could be explained entirely by their conditional mean value inside the
turbulent part: hτij ˜Siji ≈ Γhτij ˜SijiT , where Γ(x2) is the intermittency function (i.e. the
fraction of time the signal is turbulent at any given x2), and the subscript “T ” stands for
averaging conditioned on ‘turbulence’ (see O’Neil & Meneveau 1997 for details). When
replacing the conditional averages multiplied by Γ in the expression for isotropy ra-
tios, Γ cancels from both numerator and denominator. This behavior suggests that the
anisotropy ratios shown in ﬁgure 3 are equal to those inside the turbulent regions alone,
and that their rise in the outer parts of the wake cannot be explained by contributions
coming from the non-turbulent parts. However, it is still possible that non-trivial con-
tributions to the scalar-variance dissipations could originate at the interface separating
turbulent from non-turbulent regions.

To highlight the variations with ﬁlter scale more directly, in ﬁgure 4 we plot the
isotropy ratios as a function of scale, for the transverse location x2/ℓ = 1.44 close to the
peak mean temperature gradient. As is evident, the isotropy ratios of the kinetic energy
dissipation decrease towards unity as the ﬁlter size decreases, whereas the isotropy ratio
of the scalar-variance dissipation remains unchanged near Iθ ∼ 2 as the ﬁlter size is
decreased. As seen in ﬁgure 3, near the centerline, where the mean shear and scalar
gradient vanish, the SGS isotropy ratios are all near unity.

Figure 4. Isotropy ratios of kinetic energy and scalar-variance SGS dissipations at x2/ℓ = 1.44,

isotropy ratios for the SGS dissipation of kinetic energy, namely ◦, Iu22; and (cid:3), Iu12; the closed
triangles N (and solid line) are for the scalar dissipation Iθ.

Therefore, we conclude that in terms of the most important of the resolved-SGS scale
interactions (the mean SGS dissipation), the scalar ﬁeld maintains strong anisotropy
in the presence of a mean scalar gradient. Conversely, the velocity ﬁeld has the trends
expected from approach to isotropy at small scales.

Next, we quantify the isotropy level of model predictions, when the data are analyzed
in an ‘a-priori’ sense, i.e. by replacing τij and qj above by model expressions. First, the
standard eddy-diﬀusion model is considered, i.e.,

This approximation is not expected to aﬀect the accuracy of our measured isotropy ratios
signiﬁcantly. The reason is that | ˜S| and its 2D approximation are scalars which multiply
equally all terms of the squared velocity and scalar gradients and is further supported

Results are near unity almost independently of scale, including the passive scalar dissi-
pation. Proﬁles across the wake (not shown) also are near unity. This result is consistent
with the observed isotropy of the square gradient tensors shown in ﬁgure 2 (the only
S| factor). Hence, using the eddy-diﬀusion model one
diﬀerence here is the additional |

The isotropy ratios of the SGS dissipations from the nonlinear model are shown in
ﬁgure 5(b), as a function of ﬁlter scale. As is apparent in comparing with ﬁgure 4, the
main features of anisotropy and ﬁlter-size dependence are correctly reproduced qualita-
tively. Quantitatively, the levels of anisotropy are overestimated. For instance, the level of
anisotropy for the modeled SGS scalar-variance dissipation appears to stay near I nl
θ ∼ 2.5
as opposed to Iθ ∼ 2 for the real SGS scalar dissipation.

4. Summary and conclusions

In studying passive scalar statistics in a turbulent shear ﬂow with a mean temperature
gradient we focus on statistics of interest to subgrid modeling and large-eddy simulation.
In order to obtain the ﬁltered and subgrid velocities and temperatures, a probe array
composed of four X-wire and four cold-wire sensors is used and two-dimensional box
ﬁltering in the streamwise and cross-wake directions is applied to the data. The isotropy
ratios of the SGS kinetic energy and scalar-variance dissipations are investigated as func-
tion of position in the ﬂow and as a function of ﬁlter scale. Both dissipations are isotropic
independent of ﬁlter size near the centerline where there is no mean shear or scalar gra-
dient. However, at locations with high gradient (and also further towards the outer wake
regions), we ﬁnd that the scalar-variance dissipation remains highly anisotropic, indepen-
dent of ﬁlter size. Conversely, the kinetic energy dissipation tensor approaches isotropy
as the ﬁlter size is decreased. A mechanistic explanation of the observed trends in terms

of possible orientations of ramp and cliﬀ structures is not evident to us at this time.
The persistence of scalar anisotropy even at small scales is consistent with prior results
for structure functions and gradient statistics of unﬁltered turbulence (Mestayer 1982,
Sreenivasan 1991, Warhaft 2000). Present results quantify the impact of this anisotropy
on the interactions among large and small scales in the context of SGS modeling and
LES.

We ﬁnd that the predictions of eddy-diﬀusion models are much more isotropic than the
real phenomenon. This may at ﬁrst glance seem obvious since eddy-diﬀusion models are
often invoked under the banner of isotropy. However, the present result does not arise from
an explicit isotropy assumption built into the model, but because the resolved gradients
have second-order statistics that are isotropic. For instance, if the scalar gradient tensor
h ˜Gi ˜Gj i had been found to be anisotropic, it would have implied anisotropic behavior of
the eddy-diﬀusion model’s predictions. Instead, the isotropy that exists in the ﬁltered
scalar gradients is incorrectly applied to model the anisotropic statistics of the SGS heat
ﬂux. The main problem for the eddy-diﬀusion model appears to be that it uses second-
order statistics to model third-order statistics. Conversely, the anisotropy exists in the
third-order moments that arise from the velocity and scalar product (qi) multiplied by the
Gj alone (even
Gj), but is not discernible in the second-order statistics of
scalar gradient (
when modulated by the strain-rate magnitude). The anisotropy is clearly discernible,
however, in the third-order moments consisting of the ﬁltered velocity gradients times
scalar gradients squared that arise in the expression for modeled SGS dissipation of scalar-
variance using the nonlinear model. These expressions are able to reproduce the detailed
phase relationships among the velocity and scalar ﬁeld that govern the SGS dissipation
(cascade) of scalar variance. We remark that the overprediction of anisotropy by the
nonlinear model (and its underprediction by the eddy-diﬀusion model) is reminiscent
of the opposing trends of these two models documented in Liu et al. (1999) for rapidly
strained turbulence in cold-ﬂow. The opposing trends suggest that a linear combination
of the two models, i.e. the ‘mixed model’, can be tuned to reproduce the correct amount
of anisotropy (for a discussion of the application of mixed models in LES, see Meneveau
& Katz 2000). However, note that the data for Iu12 and Iu22 at ∆/η = 250 and 125 do
not provide clear justiﬁcation for choosing the mixed over the non-linear model.

Finally, it is stressed that current results are obtained in a single ﬂow for a single
moderate Reynolds number. Even if the present evidence in ﬁgure 4 of an essentially
scale-independent anisotropy for the scalar dissipation appears to be quite strong, the
results could change in another ﬂow, or at higher Reynolds numbers (we recall that
according to Sreenivasan 1996, universal behavior for the scalar requires Reλ above 1000
or so). These considerations serve as motivation for further work in this area.

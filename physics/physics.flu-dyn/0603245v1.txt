(Received ?? and in revised form ??)

A comprehensive study of the eﬀect of wall heating or cooling on the linear, transient

and secondary growth of instability in channel ﬂow is conducted. The eﬀect of viscosity

stratiﬁcation, heat diﬀusivity and of buoyancy are estimated separately, with some un-

expected results. ¿From linear stability results, it has been accepted that heat diﬀusivity

does not aﬀect stability. However, we show that realistic Prandtl numbers cause a tran-

sient growth of disturbances that is an order of magnitude higher than at zero Prandtl

number. Buoyancy, even at fairly low levels, gives rise to high levels of subcritical energy

growth. Unusually for transient growth, both of these are spanwise-independent and not

in the form of streamwise vortices. At moderate Grashof numbers, exponential growth

dominates, with distinct Rayleigh-Benard and Poiseuille modes for Grashof numbers upto

∼ 25000, which merge thereafter. Wall heating has a converse eﬀect on the secondary

instability compared to the primary, destabilising signiﬁcantly when viscosity decreases

towards the wall. It is hoped that the work will motivate experimental and numerical

eﬀorts to understand the role of wall heating in the control of channel and pipe ﬂows.

1. Introduction

One of the well-known methods for delaying a transition to turbulence, for example in

boundary layers, has been to reduce the viscosity at the wall. Such a reduction could be

brought about by heating or cooling the surface, for example. The objective of this paper

is to study the eﬀect of wall heating on the instability of a channel ﬂow. It is shown that

heat can have surprising eﬀects on the diﬀerent mechanisms of transition. We restrict

ourselves here to routes based on the linear eigenmodes, a direct nonlinear interaction will

be studied in future. The emphasis here is on delaying/advancing the onset of transition

to turbulence, rather than drag reduction in full turbulence, as achieved by adding small

quantities of polymer.

The critical Reynolds number for linear instability in a plane Poiseuille ﬂow is 5772.22

[Orszag (1971)]. However, experiments usually ﬁnd fully developed turbulence at a much

lower Reynolds number, around 1500 [see e.g. Davies & White (1928); Narayanan & Narayanan

(1967); Patel & Head (1969); Kao & Park (1970)]. It is clear that routes to turbulence

other than the traditional Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) mechanism are in operation. The

background noise in the ﬂow has a major inﬂuence in delaying/hastening transition to tur-

bulence, as well as in deciding which mechanism will be dominant [Morkovin & Reshotko

(1989)]. At extremely low levels of noise a traditional TS mechanism and/or secondary

instability is likely to be followed. At intermediate levels, a transient growth of distur-

bances is the more likely mechanism for initial disturbance growth [Schmid & Henningson

(2001); Meseguer (2002); Foster (1997); Corbett & Bottaro (2001)]. Once disturbance

growth is triggered by a linear mechanism, nonlinearities are required to achieve a new

self-sustained state. Alternatively, at higher levels of background noise, nonlinear mech-

anisms can directly come into play, see e.g. Waleﬀe (1995); Faisst & Eckhardt (2003);

Hof et al. (2004). At present it is not understood exactly which route will be followed

when (for a recent review on pipe ﬂow see Kerswell (2005)).

The eﬀect of wall heating on linear stability alone has been studied by several re-

searchers. Here too, the eﬀect of buoyancy has not been clearly quantiﬁed. To our knowl-

edge, a detailed study of other mechanisms has not been done. Two related studies of

transient growth had diﬀerent emphasis from the present work. Transient growth in two-

ﬂuid ﬂow was studied in two-dimensions by Malik & Hooper (2005) with the objective of

understanding the eﬀect of the interface. Biau & Bottaro (2004) studied transient growth

with stable thermal stratiﬁcation and concluded that such stratiﬁcation is a viable strat-

egy to control transitional ﬂows. A more detailed retrospective on earlier work is included

in the relevant sections later in the text.

We consider two types of heating. The ﬁrst is asymmetric, with the two walls main-

tained at diﬀerent constant temperatures. The second is symmetric, with the walls at

one temperature and the ﬂuid at another. Our results may be summarised as follows:

the linear stability results are in line with the ﬁndings of earlier studies. A decrease in

viscosity as one approaches a wall has a large stabilising eﬀect and vice-versa. The ef-

fect on the linear eigenmode of reduced heat diﬀusion (increasing Prandtl number) is

extremely small [Wall & Wilson (1996)]. Buoyancy has no eﬀect up to a Grashof number

of about 3000 and is enormously stabilising or destabilising thereafter, depending on the

sign of the temperature diﬀerence. The Rayleigh-Benard and Tollmien-Schlichting modes

are distinct at low Grashof number and merge at high Grashof numbers.

The eﬀect of heat on transient growth of instabilities is unexpected. Viscosity strat-

iﬁcation, which is the chief player in linear instability, has no discernible eﬀect on this

mechanism. Increasing Prandtl number, on the other hand, has an order of magnitude

destabilising eﬀect. The assumption that Prandtl number may be neglected in stabil-

ity analyses is therefore completely incorrect for this mechanism. Secondary instabilities

of the Tollmien-Schlichting modes are usually taken to be unimportant for channel-ﬂow

transition, but we ﬁnd that viscosity-stratiﬁcation can have a destabilising eﬀect on these

modes, which may make them noticeable at large temperature diﬀerences.

2. Basic Velocity Proﬁles

Two types of temperature variation, which we shall refer to as the asymmetrically

and symmetrically heated cases respectively, are considered, see ﬁgures 1 and 2. These

provide a fair sample of the type of stratiﬁcation we may come across. In the ﬁrst, the two

walls of the channel are maintained at diﬀerent temperatures, Thot and Tcold. At steady

state, the temperature within the channel varies linearly between the two. Note that for

the unstable Poiseuille-Rayleigh-Benard conﬁguration, the temperature diﬀerence ∆T

between the bottom and top walls (and hence the corresponding Richardson and Grashof

numbers, deﬁned later) is taken to be positive. The sign of ∆T is unimportant when

buoyancy is neglected.

In the second case, the walls are both maintained at the same temperature, while the

incoming ﬂuid is at a diﬀerent temperature. Such a ﬂow is non-parallel, since the ﬂuid

temperature downstream tends to equilibrate with the wall temperature, but for large

Peclet numbers, the change in the downstream direction is very slow, and the ﬂow may

safely be assumed to be locally parallel and the local temperature proﬁle to be parabolic.

Stability analyses for more realistic temperature proﬁles have been conducted, without

any qualitative diﬀerence. The temperature-dependence of the viscosity is described by

the Arrhenius model, which works fairly well for most common liquids like water and

alcohol.

taken in the present computations to be water. The streamwise direction is denoted as

deﬁned as Re = Umaxh/νref , h is the half-channel width, νref is the reference kinematic

viscosity, and dP /dx is the constant pressure gradient. The viscosity ratio is deﬁned as

m = µcold/µhot for the asymmetric heated case and m = µwall/µc, where c stands for

centerline, for the symmetric case. Knowing µ(T ) and T (y), equation 2.2 is integrated

twice by a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to get U . Figure 3 shows typical viscosity

and velocity proﬁles for asymmetric heating. Viscosity proﬁles for the symmetric case are

shown in ﬁgure 4. Corresponding velocity proﬁles and their second derivatives are shown

in ﬁgure 5.

We can see from Table 1 that the average viscosity varies signiﬁcantly with increasing

∆T , so deﬁning the Reynolds number as above is approriate for making comparisons

at a given Reynolds number between heated and unheated ﬂows. On the other hand,

it is seen from the table that the average velocity is practically unchanged by viscosity

stratiﬁcation, so the maximum velocity is a good enough velocity scale.

The Prandtl number is deﬁned as P r ≡ ν/κ where κ is the coeﬃcient of thermal

diﬀusivity. The Grashof number is Gr ≡ gγ∆T h3/ν2, γ being the volume coeﬃcient of

expansion. Equations 3.2 to 3.4 form an eigenvalue problem with the boundary conditions

v(±1) = v′(±1) = η(±1) = ˆT (±1) = 0,

(3.5)

and are solved using a Chebyshev collocation spectral method. We perform a temporal

stability analysis, the growth rate of the disturbance is obtained from the imaginary part

3.2. Eﬀect of viscosity variation

In order to isolate the eﬀect of viscosity variation, the Prandtl number and the Grashof

number are set to zero. With symmetric heating, we expect that if the viscosity decreases

as one approaches the wall, the fuller velocity proﬁle will result in a stabler ﬂow. This

expectation is realised, as seen from the neutral stability boundaries in ﬁgure 6.

However, in a channel ﬂow where one wall is maintained at a constant high temperature

and the other wall is kept cold, the viscosity decreases towards one wall and increases

towards the other. It is not a priori evident what the eﬀect on the linear stability will

be. It was found by Potter & Graber (1972) that any temperature diﬀerence between

the walls is always destabilising. However, Wall & Wilson (1996) found, using four dif-

ferent viscosity models, that a temperature diﬀerence almost always stabilises the ﬂow.

The apparent contradiction is because the former work compared results for heated and

unheated ﬂow maintaining the input power constant, while the latter made comparisons

at a given Reynolds number. Since the ﬂow rate for a given input power is higher for the

heated case, the resulting Reynolds number is higher. The stability of viscosity-stratiﬁed

channel ﬂows was also studied by Pinarbasi & Liakopoulos (1995); Schafer & Herwig

(1993) with similar conclusions and of boundary layer ﬂows by Craik (1971); Kao (1968);

Wazzan et al. (1968, 1979); Strazisar et al. (1977); Schafer et al. (1995).

In the present paper, we deﬁne the Reynolds number in terms of average viscosity,

and compare results at a given Reynolds number. In agreement with Wall & Wilson

(1996), for asymmetric heating, we ﬁnd that any temperature diﬀerence is stabilising, in

terms of the least stable (two-dimensional) linear mode (ﬁgure 7). We have conﬁrmed

[Sameen (2004)] that the production of disturbance kinetic energy is reduced at the

cold wall and increased at the hot wall compared to the unheated case. The dissipation

is similar in all cases. The highly oblique modes, unlike the two-dimensional ones, are

practically unaﬀected (not shown). This observation will assume signiﬁcance when we

discuss transient growth.

3.3. Eﬀect of heat diﬀusivity

We know that for liquids such as water, heat diﬀuses slower than momentum, so the

assumption of P r = 0 is not justiﬁable. Surprisingly however, the linear stability, as

measured by the least stable eigenmode, is practically unaﬀected by a decrease in heat

diﬀusivity [Wall & Wilson (1996)]. Present computations conﬁrm this (ﬁgure 8). How-

ever, the prevalent conclusion that heat diﬀusivity does not aﬀect ﬂow stability, and

therefore that the Peclet number may be set to zero in stability analyses, is shown in the

to a buoyancy driven instability similar to the Rayleigh-Benard [Chandrasekhar (1961);

Turner (1959); Platten & Legros (1984)]. The eﬀect of mean shear on this instability has

been studied by Zhang et al. (1998); Deardorﬀ (1965), for example, and this problem

is reviewed in Platten & Legros (1984); Mahajan et al. (1988). On the other hand, the

eﬀect of buoyancy on the Tollmien-Schlichting modes in plane Poiseuille ﬂow has been in-

vestigated by Gage & Reid (1968); Gage (1971); Tveitereid (1974) and Fujimura & Kelly

(1988). Several approximations were made in these early studies. For example, viscos-

ity variations were neglected and the base ﬂow was taken to be parabolic. It was found

that a critical Reynolds number always exists for any level of density stabilisation, while

there exists a Richardson number (Ri ≡ Gr/Re2) above which the ﬂow is stable for all

Reynolds number.

In ﬁgure 9 the critical Reynolds number,Recr for a temperature diﬀerence of 25oK

is plotted for various Richardson numbers. The trends are the same as in Gage & Reid

(1968) and Tveitereid (1974), but there are minor numerical discrepancies, which we

attribute to the more appropriate velocity and viscosity proﬁles used here. The eﬀect of

buoyancy are negligible when the Richardson number is below 10−4, and of either sign.

At higher Richardson numbers, for unstable stratiﬁcation, ﬁgure 9 shows that the ﬂow

is highly destabilised. The stability boundaries are plotted in ﬁgure 10 in terms of the

Grashof number, a given Grashof number being more simple to achieve experimentally.

Distinct modes of Rayleigh-Benard type and of Tollmien-Schlichting type are evident

at intermediate levels of Gr. The modes merge at Grashof numbers above ∼ 25000.

The numerical value at the bifurcation point varies slightly with Prandtl number and

temperature diﬀerence. The unstable region in the Grashof-Reynolds parameter space is

shown in ﬁgure 11.

We have discussed the stability in terms of the most unstable linear mode. However, a

transient growth of decaying modes can often be the dominant mechanism of transition

to turbulence in channel ﬂows. We shall see in the next section that the eﬀect of heat on

ﬂow instability throws up several surprises.

the eigenfunctions is known to be able to give rise to large levels of transient growth of dis-

turbance kinetic energy even when all individual eigenmodes are stable. In wall-bounded

ﬂows, transient growth is mainly caused by the interaction between the Orr-Sommerfeld

and Squire modes [Reddy & Henningson (1993); Criminale et al. (2003)] from the cou-

pling term, −iβU ′, appearing in Squire’s equation. The most likely structures arising due

to transient growth are streamwise streaks [Reddy et al. (1998); Reddy & Henningson

(1994, 1993); Schmid & Henningson (2001)]. We use the standard approach for comput-

ing the maximum transient growth.

The eﬀect of viscosity-stratiﬁcation, in contexts other than heat [Malik & Hooper

(2005); Chikkadi et al. (2005)] has been addressed before, though not completely. The

eﬀect of buoyancy has been studied under stable stratiﬁcation alone by Biau & Bottaro

(2004). The eﬀect of heat diﬀusivity on transient growth has not been studied before, to

our knowledge.

The disturbance kinetic energy, g(t) [Schmid & Henningson (2001)], is written as

Its time evolution is represented by the matrix ∂κ/∂t = −iΛκ, where κ = (κ1, κ2, ..., κN )T

and Λ = diag{ω1, ω2, ...ωN }, where κj is the jth expansion coeﬃcient of the eigenfunc-

tions of the linear modes which are the dominant contributors here. The superscript T

denotes transpose. Maximising equation (4.1) for all possible initial conditions κ(0),

We then deﬁne Gmax as the maximum over time of G(t) for one particular Re, α and

∆T , see ﬁgure 12.

The contour plot for Gmax for unheated ﬂow is shown at Re = 1000 in ﬁgure 13, for

comparison with the results for heated ﬂow to follow. A maximum growth of Gmax = 196

is obtained for α = 0.0 and β = 2.05 [see Reddy & Henningson (1993)].

4.1. Eﬀect of viscosity stratiﬁcation

As before, we ﬁrst take the Prandtl number to be zero, i.e., assume that temperature

ﬂuctuations diﬀuse away instantaneously. We also neglect buoyancy, in order to isolate

the eﬀect of viscosity stratiﬁcation alone. For the asymmetrically heated case, the growth

of kinetic energy is seen in ﬁgure 12 to change only marginally with heating. The example

shown in ﬁgure 12 is for Re = 3000 and α = 1, but viscosity stratiﬁcation has very little

eﬀect on transient growth at any value of Re and α. The eﬀect of asymmetric heating

is quantiﬁed in ﬁgure 14 in terms of Gmax at α = 0 and β = 2. There is a marginal

stabilisation with viscosity stratiﬁcation. This result is in line with the result for linear

stability, but much smaller in magnitude. The contours of Gmax for symmetric heating

are plotted in ﬁgures 15 in the α − β plane, and the variation of Gmax with viscosity

ratio is plotted in ﬁgure 16 at α = 0. There is again a slight stabilisation with increase

in viscosity stratiﬁcation.

The insigniﬁcant eﬀect of viscosity stratiﬁcation is consistent with our recent study

similar at two extremes of viscosity stratiﬁcation. Equation 3.3 drives the dynamics rather

than equation 3.2 under these conditions, and the terms containing viscosity gradients

have been veriﬁed numerically to be small.

4.2. Eﬀect of heat diﬀusivity

It has been seen that the Prandtl number has a marginal eﬀect on the most unstable linear

mode. In contrast, we ﬁnd here that reducing heat diﬀusivity has a large destabilising

eﬀect on the transient growth of disturbance kinetic energy. A dimensionless quantity for

measuring growth is the energy norm deﬁned as

E =

Z

|up|2 + |vp|2 + |wp|2 + | ˆT |2dy.

(4.3)

There is some ﬂexibility in deﬁning the measure, but the results are not expected to

change qualitatively [Haniﬁ & Henningson (1998); Biau & Bottaro (2004)]. In ﬁgure 18

for a temperature diﬀerence of 25oK at a Reynolds number of 1000 the eﬀect of Prandtl

number is shown. As the Prandtl number is increased from 10−4 to 1, the transient

growth is seen to increase dramatically. The large destabilisation comes from a new two-

dimensional transient growth. This is true for symmetric heating as well (not shown).

We now have a situation where transient growth dominates, but not via the standard

streamwise streaks and streamwise vortices.

4.3. Eﬀect of unstable density stratiﬁcation

In their studies of stable thermal stratiﬁcation Biau & Bottaro (2004) have found that

as stratiﬁcation increases ﬂow becomes increasingly stable, both in terms of exponential

growth as well as transient growth. Viscosity variations were not accounted for in their

calculation. In this paper, we concentrate on unstable thermal stratiﬁcation.

Figures 19 to 22 show contour plots of maximum growth of transient energy for various

Grashof numbers at increasing Prandtl number for a temperature diﬀerence of ∆T =

25oK. As expected, when heat diﬀusivity is high, buoyancy has little eﬀect. For P r 6

0.01, the Prandtl number dictates the instability, and buoyancy has very little eﬀect. At

P r = 1, however, the situation is completely diﬀerent. For Grashof numbers of 1000 and

transient growth in unheated channel ﬂow is well known to display itself as streamwise-

independent structures, like streaks and vortices. Our results indicate that such structures

will not be much in evidence in heated ﬂows at realistic Prandtl or Grashof numbers.

Rather, a spanwise-independent growth occurs. Experimental and numerical veriﬁcation

of this kind of transient growth could have interesting consequences for wall heating as

a control option.

5. Secondary Instability

A ﬂow containing linear modes (either growing or decaying) of suﬃcient amplitude

Ap can become unstable to new secondary modes of instability. In unheated channel

ﬂow, secondary instability is considered unimportant, since it may only play a role when

external disturbance levels are extremely small. We show here that viscosity variations

can signiﬁcantly destabilise the secondary mode, thus making it more relevant to the

transition process. The Prandtl number and Grashof number are set equal to zero.

The approach here is as in Herbert (1983) and Bayly et al. (1988). All ﬂow variables

are decomposed in the form

u(x, y, z, t) = U (y) + Ap ˆup(x, y, t) + As ˆus(x, y, z, t),

(5.1)

where ˆup is the linear instability mode of the previous section. A subscript p has been

introduced in this section to denote primary mode of instability. As is the amplitude of

Figure 22. Same as ﬁgure 19, except that P r = 1. The transient growth is even

higher than before. The region inside the thick curve for Gr = 104 is linearly

the secondary. Note that since only the least stable linear modes are relevant here, it is

suﬃcient to consider two-dimensional primary modes, by Squire’s theorem.

The secondary perturbation quantities are assumed to be of the form

(ˆus, ˆvs, ˆws) =

where α+ and α− are the wave numbers of the secondary waves in the streamwise di-

rection, βs is the wave number in the spanwise direction. The direct interaction between

primary waves is assumed to be negligible. For the ﬂow under consideration, the growth/

decay rates are so small that dAp/dt can be neglected during one period of time, and the

primary ﬂow may be taken to be periodic. Substituting these decompositions in the mo-

mentum equations, eliminating pressure and neglecting non-linear terms in the secondary

disturbance, we arrive at the secondary disturbance equations. On averaging these over

α+ + α− = α.

(5.3)

The cases of α+ = α/2 and α+ = α are called the subharmonic and the fundamental

modes respectively. Using continuity the streamwise component of secondary disturbance

velocity is eliminated and we get the secondary perturbation equations:

F (Ap, βs, m, Re, α, c, ) = 0 [see Herbert (1983)]. The growth rate is highly sensitive to the

primary amplitude level Ap, and increases with increasing Ap. The present computations

are validated by comparing with the unstratiﬁed case in Herbert (1983) as discussed in

Sameen (2004).

5.1. Asymmetric heating

A value of Ap = 0.01 is taken, to be representative of an intermediate level of primary

disturbance. The variation of secondary growth rate ωis with the spanwise wave number

for various viscosity ratios is plotted in ﬁgures 23. As the temperature diﬀerence increases,

a second highly unstable mode appears. This mode is three-dimensional, the spanwise

and streamwise wavelengths being very close to each other. The modes which are closer

to two-dimensional are now stabilised. A nonlinear or transient growth triggered by this

new mode could mean that transition to turbulence proceeds somewhat diﬀerently, but

further studies are needed to evaluate this.

While we have taken the amplitude of the primary mode to be constant, it is in

fact, at these Reynolds numbers, a known slowly decaying function of time. Integrating

instantaneous results over long times, we can compute the time dependence of amplitude

of the secondary mode. This approach is a counterpart in time of the assumption of

parallel ﬂow in ﬂows which vary slowly in x. The amplitude of the subharmonic secondary

mode As is shown as a function of time in ﬁgure 24. At low initial Ap, secondary modes

are always stable while for higher Ap signiﬁcant growth is displayed up to large times. At

low Reynolds number, the initial Ap needed for a sustained secondary instability growth

is very high.

5.2. Symmetrically heated channel

Figure 26 shows the secondary perturbation growth rate variation with spanwise wave

number βs. A stabilisation with increase in viscosity ratio, especially when m > 1, is

evident. This behaviour is remarkable, being counter intuitive and opposite to the be-

haviour of the primary instability mode. The phase locking behaviour is similar to the

asymmetrically heated case.

We have seen that in linear disturbance growth, the mean velocity proﬁle (via the U ′′

term) has a dominant role. In the case of secondary growth as well, Orszag & Patera

(1983) have argued that inviscid eﬀects are dominant, and act through vortex stretching

This is veriﬁed by switching oﬀ the viscosity gradient terms in the secondary

and tilting. We are not able to make a conclusive statement on this, but it seems that

heating aﬀects secondary instability by an inviscid mechanism, through changes in the

velocity proﬁle. This is demonstrated in ﬁgure 27, where it is seen that switching oﬀ

the viscosity gradient terms makes little diﬀerence to the result. Also, it is not evident

why the sign of instability is opposite to that of primary modal growth. The relevant

inference here is that viscosity stratiﬁcation alone can have unexpected eﬀects on the

various mechanisms leading to transition to turbulence.

6. Conclusion

The control of the ﬂow using heating or cooling of the surface has long been prac-

tised, especially in open ﬂows. In plane channel ﬂow we have conducted a comprehensive

study of the eﬀect of heat, and show that there is no unique direction (either towards

or away from stabilisation) in which the ﬂow responds. Linear stability results are con-

sistent with earlier studies in that the most unstable linear mode is suppressed when

viscosity decreases towards the wall. Also the eﬀect of Prandtl number is negligible. For

Grashof number between about 3000 and 25000, separate modes of Rayleigh-Benard and

Tollmien-Schlichting instability are evident, the former is at low Reynolds number. At

higher levels of buoyancy, the modes merge.

The transient growth of disturbances is unaﬀected by viscosity stratiﬁcation, but

hugely increased by reduced heat diﬀusivity. Both of these are counter to the eﬀect on

the least stable linear mode. The Prandtl number is thus not an unimportant parameter,

as was hitherto assumed. Transient growth is also very high in the presence of buoyancy

of the appropriate sign. With increasing Prandtl and/or Grashof number, the growth is

two-dimensional, not in streamwise streaks, which is quite unusual for transient growth.

Secondary instability of Tollmien-Schlichting waves is not considered an important

player in the transition to turbulence in unheated channel ﬂow, unless the free stream is

unrealistically quiet. We show that a new destabilising mode appears with heating, for

the case where viscosity is decreasing towards the wall!

It is hoped that this work with give impetus to experimental and computational studies

to check these predictions and to explore wall heating in all its aspects as a control

strategy for channel and pipe ﬂows.

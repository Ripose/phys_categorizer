Abstract

In studies on Marangoni type motion of particles the surface tension is often

approximated as a linear function of temperature. For deformable particles in a

linear external temperature gradient far from the reference point this approximation

yields a negative surface tension which is physically unrealistic. It is shown that

H. Zhou and R. H. Davis (J. Colloid Interface Sci., 181, 60, (1996)) presented

calculation where the leading deformable drop moved into a region of negative

surface tension. With respect numerical studies the restriction of the migration of

two deformable drops is given in terms of the drift time.

The bulk ﬂuid motion induced by an interface has been studied for over a century.

One of the most interesting phenomena is the capillary motion of particles through a

viscous ﬂuid. Young, Goldstein and Block (1) and later Bratukhin (2) performed the

ﬁrst systematic study of the migration of bubbles and droplets. As noted in review (3)

the capillary motion arises due to gradient of the surface tension γ at the interface as a

result of a non–uniform temperature or surfactant distribution in the surrounding media.

The surface tension gradient results in a tangential stress on the interface which causes

1

the motion of the surrounding liquid by viscous traction. Then, the droplet or bubble

will move in the direction of decreasing interfacial tension. It is necessary to note that

the normal component of the capillary forces arising during the motion may deform the

shape of a particle (2). Young, Goldstein and Block (1) and others have shown that in

the limit of high surface tension (undeformed spherical particle) its motion is controlled

by surface tension gradients only. Note that the motion of a deformable particle also

depends on the surface tension itself.

If the particle moves with constant velocity the transformation of a laboratory co-

ordinate system to a coordinate system moving with the particle frame will essentially

simplify the solution (2), (3), (5). Let us denote the particle coordinate system moving

with the droplet velocity U by O′ and the laboratory coordinate system by O respec-

tively. We consider the coordinate transform from O to O′ in the case of a drop moving

in the uniform external temperature gradient Aex (2), see Fig.1. For an arbitrary point

In the limit of an inﬁnitely large surface tension the normal stress boundary condition

is not modiﬁed under the above transformation [8]. However, in the case of ﬁnite surface

tension, this boundary condition requires special attention. Usually, γ is assumed to be

The surface tension γ

From [3] and [4] follows an upper bound of the drift distance Ut in system O or an upper

bound of the time of particle migration in the moving system O′.

Ignoring the above restrictions results in the appearance of a negative surface tension

in the course of the particle migration in ﬁnite time and thus may lead to a physically

unrealistic behavior of the particle. This restriction is relaxed in the case of the un-

deformed drop (1), (4) and (3) where the normal stress boundary condition is always

satisﬁed. However, this is not true when the surface tension has a ﬁnite value. We noted

that in the literature on thermocapillary migration of drops and bubbles no attention

was paid to this point. For example, Zhou and Davis (7) ﬁrst considered the problem of

axisymmetric thermocapillary migration of two deformable viscous drops . The authors

assumed a linear dependence of surface tension on temperature. In terms of (7) we have

γ(xs) = γ0 +

(T (xs) − T0(xr)) ,

∂γ
∂T

where T (xs) is the temperature at a point xs on the interface and T0(xr) is a reference

temperature. In an attempt to obtain a solution which is independent of the choice of

xr, Zhou and Davis ﬁx xr to be the intersection point of the axis of symmetry with the

surface of the leading drop, see Fig.1 and their Fig.1 in (7).

It is important to note

that this choice of xr means a coordinate transform from the laboratory frame to the

coordinate system moving with the leading droplet. Hence, the normal stress balance is

modiﬁed. The other boundary conditions and the governing equations remain the same

due to the linearity of Stokes and Laplace equations (7). For more details see (2) and (4).

Zhou and Davis (7) give for the dimensionless surface tension in the moving coordinate

system

¯γ(xs) = 1 − q ¯T (xs),

where ¯γ = γ/γ0 is the dimensionless surface tension, q = aA(−∂γ/∂T ) is the di-

mensionless rate of change of the interfacial tension due to temperature variation,

¯T (xs) = (T (xs) − T0(xr))/(aA) is the dimensionless temperature diﬀerence and a is

the radius of the ﬁrst drop. It can readily be seen that Eq.[6] deﬁnes surface tension

which is positive for any time or migration distances. As we showed before, the correct

transformation of the linear approximation [5] leads to a negative surface tension in ﬁnite

time. The previous conclusion that physically acceptable solutions must be restricted by

migration time contradicts Eq. [6].

Let us derive the correct form of the transformed surface tension in terms of (7). The

problem of the migration of two droplets is evolutionary and it must be accomplished

by a kinematic condition applied on the droplets’ surfaces. The transformation from the

laboratory coordinate system to the particle coordinate system are given by (5):

The integral term in Eq. [10] changes the scenario of a numerical calculation. The surface

tension changes with time and it is necessary to keep ¯γ positive.

We shall now proceed to estimate the time when the surface tension of some point

xr on the leading drop will not satisfy [4]. For simplicity let us stay in the laboratory

coordinate system, for ¯γ = 0 we obtain the relation 1

readily seen that the dimensionless length of a spatial frame is given by X = 1

the maximum transformation distance of the leading drop is the diﬀerence between X

and the initial position xr. For the case of equal material parameters considered by (7)

we have a = 1 and the surface separation distance on the axes is ∼ 1. Hence the length

of the drops’ drift is also ∼ 1. Let us assume that the lower bound of the velocities for

moving deformable drops is the velocity of non–deformable drops. For slightly unequal

drops and a large separation distance between their centers the velocities are nearly the

same and equal to the Young–Bratukhin value of 0.133.. Following Eq.

[12] in (7) we

normalize this value with 2/15 because for inner and outer liquids the viscosity and the

thermal diﬀusivity are equal. From this normalization procedure we obtain that the

migration velocities are ∼ 1. As a result the critical value of the migration time is ∼ 1.

We developed a numerical code for solving the problem of the motion of two de-

formable viscous drops in an external temperature gradient (9). Restrictions [4] were

considered in the laboratory coordinate system O. In Fig.2 we plotted the evolution of

the minimum separation distance d between the droplets’ surfaces in time. We chose

a = 1, α = 0.5, q = 0.2 in terms of (7), where α is the droplets radii ratio. The dotted

curve conﬁnes the physical region where [4] is satisﬁed. The curves 1 − 10 correspond to

diﬀerent initial separations. Curve 2 is in agreement with the results given by Zhou and

Davis (see Fig.4 in (7)) and with the asymptotics for the non–deformable drops (8).

Our computations show that the patterns of drops deformations are similar to those

described by (7) but correspond to smaller separation distances d. Note that our analysis

initially spherical drops and an initial separation distance d = 0.01 Fig.3 depicts the

series of drops’ proﬁles corresponding to the points a, b and c in Fig.2.

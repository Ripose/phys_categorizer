Inverse statistics in turbulence

The concept of inverse statistics in turbulence has attracted much attention in the recent years.
It is argued that the scaling exponents of the direct structure functions and the inverse structure
functions satisfy an inversion formula. This proposition has already been veriﬁed by numerical data
using the shell model. However, no direct evidence was reported for experimental three dimensional
turbulence. We propose to test the inversion formula using experimental data of three dimensional
fully developed turbulence by considering the energy dissipation rates in stead of the usual eﬀorts on
the structure functions. The moments of the exit distances are shown to exhibit nice multifractality.
The inversion formula between the direct and inverse exponents is then veriﬁed.

Intermittency of fully developed isotropic turbulence is
well captured by highly nontrivial scaling laws in struc-
ture functions and multifractal nature of energy dissipa-
tion rates [1]. The direct (longitudinal) structure func-
tion of order q is deﬁned by Sq(r) ≡ h∆vk(r)qi, where
∆vk(r) is the longitudinal velocity diﬀerence of two po-
sitions with a separation of r. The anomalous scaling
properties characterized by Sq(r) ∼ rζ(q) with a nonlin-
ear scaling exponent function ζ(q) were uncovered exper-
imentally [2].

While the direct structure functions consider the sta-
tistical moments of the velocity increments ∆v measured
over a distance r, the inverse structure functions are con-
cerned with the exit distance r where the velocity ﬂuc-
tuation exceeds the threshold ∆v at minimal distance
[3]. An alternative quantity is thus introduced, denoted
the distance structure functions [3] or inverse structure
functions [4, 5], that is, Tq(∆v) ≡ hrq(∆v)i. Due to the
duality between the two methodologies, one can intu-
itively expected that there is a power-law scaling stating
that Tp(∆v) ∼ ∆vφ(p), where φ(p) is a nonlinear con-
cave function. This point is veriﬁed by the synthetic
data from the GOY shell model of turbulence exhibit-
ing perfect scaling dependence of the inverse structure
functions on the velocity threshold [3]. Although the in-
verse structure functions of two-dimensional turbulence
exhibit sound multifractal nature [5], a completely diﬀer-
ent result was obtained for three-dimensional turbulence,
where an experimental signal at high Reynolds number
was analyzed and no clear power law scaling was found in
the exit distance structure functions [4]. Instead, diﬀer-
ent experiments show that the inverse structure functions
of three-dimensional turbulence exhibit clear extended
self-similarity [6, 7, 8].

which is veriﬁed by the simulated velocity ﬂuctuations
from the shell model. This same relation is also derived
intuitively in an alternative way for velocity ﬁelds [10]. A
similar derivation was given for Laplace random walks as
well [11]. However, this prediction (1) is not conﬁrmed
by wind-tunnel turbulence experiments (Reynolds num-
bers Re = 400 − 1100) [7]. We argue that this dilemma
comes from the ignoring of the fact that velocity ﬂuc-
tuation is not a conservative measure like the binomial
measure. In other words, Eq. (1) can not be applied to
nonconservative multifractal measures.

Actually, Eq. (1) is known as the inversion formula and
has been proved mathematically for both discontinuous
and continuous multifractal measures [12, 13]. Let µ be
a probability measure on [0, 1] with its integral function
M (t) = µ([0, t]). Then its inverse measure can be deﬁned
by

µ† = M †(s) =

It is easy to verify that the inversion formula holds that

Two equivalent testable formulae follow immediately that

and

Due to the conservation nature of the measure and its
inverse in the formulation outlined above, we ﬁgure that
it is better to test the inverse formula in turbulence by
considering the energy dissipation.

Very good quality high-Reynolds turbulence data have
been collected at the S1 ONERA wind tunnel by the
Grenoble group from LEGI [2]. We use the longitudinal
velocity data obtained from this group. The size of the
velocity time series that we analyzed is N ≈ 1.73 × 107.
The mean velocity of the ﬂow is approximately hvi =
20m/s (compressive eﬀects are thus negligible). The root-
mean-square velocity ﬂuctuations is vrms = 1.7m/s, lead-
ing to a turbulence intensity equal to I = vrms/hvi =
0.0826. This is suﬃciently small to allow for the use of
Taylor’s frozen ﬂow hypothesis. The integral scale is ap-
proximately 4m but is diﬃcult to estimate precisely as
the turbulent ﬂow is neither isotropic nor homogeneous
at these large scales.

The Kolmogorov microscale η is given by [14] η =

its discrete approximation with a time step increment
∂t = 3.5466 × 10−5s corresponding to the spatial resolu-
tion ǫ = 0.72mm divided by hvi, which is used to transform
the data from time to space applying Taylor’s frozen ﬂow
hypothesis.

The Taylor scale is given by [14] λ =

h(∂v/∂t)2i1/2 =
16.6mm. The Taylor scale is thus about 85 times the
Kolmogorov scale. The Taylor-scale Reynolds number
is Reλ = vrmsλ
ν = 2000. This number is actually not con-
stant along the whole data set and ﬂuctuates by about
20%.

We have checked that the standard scaling laws pre-
viously reported in the literature are recovered with this
time series. In particular, we have veriﬁed the validity of
the power-law scaling E(k) ∼ k−β with an exponent β
very close to 5
3 over a range more than two decades, sim-
ilar to Fig. 5.4 of [1] provided by Gagne and Marchand

on a similar data set from the same experimental group.
Similarly, we have checked carefully the determination of
the inertial range by combining the scaling ranges of sev-
eral velocity structure functions (see Fig. 8.6 of [1, Fig.
8.6]). Conservatively, we are led to a well-deﬁned inertial
range 60 ≤ r/η ≤ 2000.

The exit distance sequence r(δE) = {rj(δE)} for a
given energy threshold δE can be obtained as follows.
For a velocity time series {vi = v(ti) : i = 1, 2, · · · },
the energy dissipation rate series is constructed as {Ei =
(vi+1 −vi)2}. We assume that Ei is distributed uniformly
on the interval [ti, ti+1). A right continuous energy den-
sity function is constructed such that e(t) = Ei for t ∈
[ti, ti+1). The exit distance sequence {rj(δE)} is deter-

rj (2δE) = r2j−1(δE) + r2j (δE) .

(8)

With this relation, we can reduce the computational time
signiﬁcantly. In order to determine ri(δE), we choose a
minimal threshold Emin, one tenth of the mean of {Ei},
and obtain ri(Emin). Then other sequences of ri for inte-
ger δE/Emin can be easily determined with relation (8).
In Fig. 1 is shown the empirical probability density
functions (pdf’s) of exit distance r/η for energy incre-
ments Emin, 2Emin, and 4Emin. At a ﬁst glance, the
probability density functions are roughly Gaussian, as
shown by the continuous curves in Fig. 1. The value of
µ0 is the ﬁtted parameter of the mean µ in the Gaussian
distribution. For r/η < µ0, the three empirical pdf’s col-
lapse to a single curve. However, for large r/η > µ0, the
three empirical pdf’s diﬀer from each other, especially in
the right-hand-side tail distributions. This discrepancy
is the cause of the occurrence of multifractal behavior of
exit distance, which we shall show below.

An intriguing feature in the empirical pdf is emergence
of small peaks observed at r/ǫ = 1, 2, · · · in the tail dis-
tributions. Comparably, the pdf of exit distance of multi-
nomial measure exhibits clear singular peaks. Therefore,
these small peaks in Fig. 1 can be interpreted as ﬁnite-size
truncations of singular distributions, showing the under-
lying singularity of the dissipation energy, which is con-
sistent with the multifractal nature of the exit distance
of dissipation energy.

According to the empirical probability density func-
tions, the moments of exit distance exist for both posi-
tive and negative orders. Figure 2 illustrates the double
r)]1/(p−1) versus δE/E for
logarithmic plots of [Tp(r/
diﬀerent values of p. For all values of p, the power-law
P
dependence is evident. The straight lines are best ﬁts to
the data, whose slopes are estimates of θ(p)/(p − 1).

The inverse scaling exponent θ(p) is plotted as trian-
gles in Fig. 3 against order p, while the direct scaling
exponent τ (q) is shown as open circles. We can obtain
the function −τ −1(−p) numerically from the τ (q) curve,

which is shown as a dashed line. One can observe that
the two functions θ(p) and −τ −1(−p) coincide remark-
ably, which veriﬁes the inverse formulation (6). Similarly,
we obtained −θ−1(−q) numerically from the θ(p) curve,
shown as a solid line. Again, a nice agreements between
τ (q) and −θ−1(−q) is observed, which veriﬁes (7).

In summary, we have suggested to test the inversion
formula in three dimensional fully developed turbulence
by considering the energy dissipation rates in stead of the
usual eﬀorts on the structure functions. The moments of
the exit distances exhibit nice multifractality. We have
veriﬁed the inversion formula between the direct and in-
verse exponents.

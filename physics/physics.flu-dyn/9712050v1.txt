Odd Viscosity

J. E. Avron

February 25, 2014

Abstract

When time reversal is broken the viscosity tensor can have a non vanishing

odd part. In two dimensions, and only then, such odd viscosity is compatible

with isotropy. Allowing for odd viscosity leads to a generalization of the

wave and Navier-Stokes equations. Elementary features of odd viscosity are

examined by considering solutions of these equations for hypothetical ﬂuids

where the stress is dominated by odd viscosity.

Introduction and summary of results: Normally, one associates viscosity with

dissipation. However, since viscosity is, in general, a tensor, this need not always

be the case. Breaking time reversal can lead to viscosity without dissipation, in

the same way that it can lead to non-dissipating Hall conductance. The ordinary,

dissipative viscosity is more important in liquids than is solids and then for small

Reynolds numbers more than for large ones. For similar reasons it is natural to

expect that the non-dissipative viscosity is more important for liquids than for solids

and then for small Reynolds numbers more than for large ones. I shall study here

1

elementary solutions of the wave and Navier-Stokes equations for hypothetical media

where the odd and non-dissipating viscosity dominates.

Odd viscosity makes sense in both two and three dimensions and I shall study

the wave equations both in two and three dimensions. But, there is something

particularly natural about odd viscosity in two dimensions. This is because odd

viscosity is compatible with isotropy only in two dimensions. For this reason I shall

consider the Navier-Stokes equations only in two dimensions.

The main results are as follows: Perfectly compressible media with non zero

odd viscosity support viscosity waves. These are non decaying chiral, circularly

polarized waves with a quadratic dispersion.

Isotropic and incompressible media

in two dimensions can not support viscosity waves. Incompressible and anisotropic

media in three dimensions can support viscosity waves and can act as polarizers for

elastic waves.

A dimensioless number that plays a role in the theory is

ε =

νω
c2

(1)

where ν is the kinematic viscosity, ω the frequency, and c the velocity of sound. ε

is a measure of the importance of viscosity and compares viscosity with elasticity.

ε−1/2 plays the role of the index of refraction in the refraction of elastic waves from a

medium with odd viscosity. For the ordinary and dissipating viscosity, the kinematic

viscosity for ordinary matter is typically of order 1 in cgs units. Since c is typically

of order 105 in cgs, ε is of order unity for ω of order GHz.

The generalized Navier-Stokes equation that allows for odd viscosity preserves

the basic properties of ﬂuid dynamics of the ordinary Navier-Stokes equation of

isotropic and incompressible ﬂuids in two dimensions: Kelvin theorem and Bernoulli

2

law generalize to non zero odd viscosity. Odd viscosity, however, can lead to some-

what odd behavior: Consider a rotating circular disc in two dimensions at low

Reynolds numebrs. The dissipative viscosity applies a torque on the disc which

resists the rotation. The odd viscosity leads to radial pressure on the disc which is

proportional to the rate of rotation (and the coeﬃcient of odd viscosity, of course).

Reversing the orientation of rotation, reverses the sign of this pressure.

Odd Viscosity: Consider a hypothetical, homogeneous and ideal Newtonian ﬂuid

where the stress is dominated by viscosity. That is,

σv
ij = ηijkl ˙ukl.

(2)

where uij = 1

2 (ui,j + uj,i) is the strain, ˙ujk is the strain rate, η a (constant) viscosity

tensor and σ the stress. By general principles, [1], the viscosity tensor, ηijkl, is

symmetric under i ↔ j, and k ↔ l. One can always write η = ηS + ηA where

ηA is anti symmetric under {ij} ↔ {kl} and ηS is symmetric under {ij} ↔ {kl}.

By Onsager relation [2] the anti-symmetric part is odd under time reversal and the

symmetric part is even, e.g., with B an external magnetic ﬁeld;

ηS(B) = ηS(−B),

ηA(B) = −ηA(−B).

(3)

So, for ηA 6= 0 time reversal must be broken. One can ask if odd viscosity is not just

a way of mascarading, say, an external magnetic ﬁeld. The answer to this is no. This

can be seen by a counting argument. A (constant) magnetic ﬁeld in two dimensions

is a single (pseudo) scalar, while the space of (constant) anti-symmetric 4-tensors

ηA is three dimensional in two dimensions. It is determined by ηA

1122, ηA

1211, ηA

1222.

The magnetic ﬁeld is a (pseudo) vector in three dimensions while the space of anti-

symmetric tensors ηA is 15 dimensional in three dimensions.

3

Odd Viscosity in Isotropic Media: In two dimensions there is a one parameter

family of isotropic ηA determined by

1122 = 0, ηA
ηA

1211 = −ηA

1222 = ηa.

(4)

(5)

(6)

It is suﬃcient that a two dimensional medium is invariant under rotation by π/4 for

ηA to have this form. In particular, the stress is automatically traceless in this case

and

11 = −σv
σv

22 = −2ηa ˙u12,

12 = ηa( ˙u11 − ˙u22).
σv

As a consequence of this, isotropic two dimensional media are characterized, in

general, by three coeﬃcients of viscosity: two for the even part:

ijkl = ηs (δikδjl + δilδjk − δijδkl) + ζ s δijδkl,
ηS

and the third for the odd viscosity ηa. This is in contrast with a claim made in [3]

(p. 45-46), and in [6] §15, that isotropy alone implies that the viscosity tensor has

two coeﬃcients of viscosity. In a ﬂuid which is incompressible the second viscosity

coeﬃcient ζ s plays no role and can be taken without loss to be zero. Incompressible

and isotropic ﬂuids in two dimensions with broken time reversal are therefor char-

acterized by two viscosity coeﬃcients one for the odd part, ηa, and one for the even

part ηs.

In three dimensions isotropy indeed implies that ηA = 0. So, three dimensional

isotropic media are characterized by only two coeﬃcients of viscosity, and both of

these are associated with the even part of the viscosity tensor. This can be seen

by the following elementary argument, which I owe to L. Sadun. Vectors in three

dimensions are associated with the 1 representation of the rotation group. 2-tensors

are identiﬁed with

1 ⊗ 1 = 2 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 0

4

representation of the rotation group. The vector representation 1 on the right hand

side, is associated with pseudo vectors and so with the antisymmetric 2-tensors.

The 2 ⊕ 0 is the six dimensional representation associated with the symmetric 2-

tensors. This shows that there is one isotropic 2-tensor in three dimensions, namely

the identity. Continuing in this vein, tensors tijkl with the symmetry i ↔ j, and

k ↔ l are identiﬁed with

(2 ⊕ 0)2 = 4 ⊕ 3 ⊕ 3 · 2 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 2 · 0.

(7)

This shows that the space of isotropic 4-tensors with the symmetry i ↔ j, and k ↔ l

is 2-dimensional. The isotropic 4-tensors tS make a two dimensional family, given

by

tS
ijkl = t1δijδkl + t2

δikδjl + δilδjk −

δijδkl

,

(8)

(cid:18)

3

(cid:19)

this leaves nothing for the isotropic antisymmetric 4-tensor and so ηA = 0.

Physical Systems: It is conceivable that that ηA 6= 0 for most system where time

reversal is broken either spontaneously or by external ﬁelds1. However, I do not

know of any example of a physical system where ηA 6= 0 is known to play a role.

Indeed, the motivation for the present work has been to try and understand under

what circumstances odd viscosity might, indeed, play a role. The motivation for

studying odd viscosity at all comes from theoretical calculations that give ηA 6= 0

for a concrete model. This model is remarkable because not only is ηA 6= 0 but also

ηS = 0 and, moreover, ηA is isotropic. This model is the two dimensional quantum

Hall ﬂuid of a full Landau level of non interacting electrons. The viscosity of such

electron gas has been calculated in [4] for the lowest Landau level and in [5] for any
1Provided, of course, that there is no other symmetry, like isotropy in three dimensions, that

rules out ηA 6= 0.

e is the charge of the electron, c the velocity of light. It is an amusing coincidence

is close to n in cgs units. It is well known that such an electron gas is incompressible.

Because of this the study of wave and Navier Stokes equations with odd viscosity

that we undertake is biased towards two dimensional isotropic and incompressible

ﬂuids.

Viscosity Waves: Let me start with the study of viscosity waves for a hypothetical

ideal three dimensional medium where the stress tensor is dominated by the odd

viscosity. By this I mean a medium where Newton equation takes the form [1]:

ρ¨ui = ∂jσv
ij.

(11)

where ρ is the (mass) density, uj the (cartesian) j-th component of the displacement

(assumed small), and σv, the stress tensor, depends linearly on the strain rate.

Linear elasticity is mathematically trivial in the sense that solving the PDE reduces

to a problem in linear algebra, and as such is a convenient and elementary setting

to see what odd viscosity can do. The non linear and non trivial case of ﬂuid ﬂow

with odd viscosity will be considered later. I shall consider homogeneous systems

where ρ is a constant so one can, without loss, set ρ = 1 (by absorbing ρ in σ.) For

a medium with odd viscosity Newton equation gives a linear PDE which is second

order in space and time:

¨ui = ηA

ijkl ˙ul,jk.

6

(12)

This equation is not just an alternative way of describing the Lorentz force. The

corresponding Newton-Lorentz equation:

¨u + B ∧ ˙u = 0,

(13)

is not a PDE.

Energy Flux: In the case ηS = 0 one can deﬁne a conserved current associated

with conservation of energy. The kinetic energy density:

E =

(2 ˙¯u · ˙u + ˙u · ˙u + ˙¯u · ˙¯u) ,

1
4

satisﬁes a conservation law:

where the energy ﬂux J is

∂tE = ∂iJi,

Ji = ηA

ijkl Re ( ˙uj) Re( ˙ukl) = σv

ijRe( ˙uj).

(14)

(15)

(16)

It follows that odd viscosity carries energy ﬂux. There is a generalization of this

energy ﬂux to media where the stress also has elastic part.

Viscosity Waves in Anisotropic Media: Ideal viscosity waves are associated with

hypothetical materials where ηA 6= 0, but ηS = 0 and there is negligible elastic

stress. Newton equation for viscosity waves admits an integral and by choosing the

constant of integration appropriately, reads:

˙ui = ηA

ijklul,jk.

(17)

This equation is ﬁrst order in time and second order in space.

It looks just like

Schr¨odinger equation. But it is a classical equation in the sense that the wave

function is directly observable. Consider plane waves solutions to this equation with

7

wave vector k. Let2 Ω(k) be the (pseudo) vector with components that are quadratic

forms in the coordinates kj:

Newton law for a plane wave propagating in the k direction can be written as:

This equation of motion, Eq. (19), is reminiscent of the Landau Lifshitz equation for

magnons 3. From this equation it is clear that the viscosity wave in three dimensions

is chiral and circularly polarized in the plane perpendicular to the vector Ω(k) and

has quadratic dispersion. One can, without loss, choose the direction of propagation

to be the 1 direction, then

Ωi(k) = ǫijkηA

jαβkkαkβ.

˙u = Ω(k) ∧ u.

(18)

(19)

(20)

clearly the wave has quadratic dispersion. Recall that ordinary sounds waves have

linear dispersion, but, rods and plates also allow for elastic modes with quadratic

dispersion [1].

Shear Waves: It is instructive to contrast viscosity waves with shear waves [6].

For shear waves ηS 6= 0 and ηA = 0, and the dispersion curves are pure imaginary

iω = −ηSk2,

ηS, ω > 0 Im k > 0.

(21)

Shear waves decay rapidly, by a factor of about exp(2π) ≈ 540 in one period [1].

If one now consider a mixed situation where ηS and ηA are of the same magnitude

then the attenuation is much weaker—of order exp(2π tan(π/8)) ≈ 13.

Reﬂection: Consider the reﬂection of ideal viscosity waves in two dimensional

isotropic and perfectly compressible medium from an interface with a vacuum which

we take to be the line x = 0. A viscosity waves is

u(z) =

z,

z = exp i(k · x − ωt),

(22)

1

i









where ω = ηak2. The waves is circularly polarized in the plane and changes polar-

ization from longitudinal to transversal. The boundary conditions at x = 0 are

σ11 = σ12 = 0.

(23)

For this wave:

σ11(u) = −η1112 ¯k,

σ12(u) = −iη1112 ¯k;

k = k1 + ik2,

¯k = k1 − ik2.

(24)

Let k = (k1, k2) be the incident wave, ˜k = (−k1, k2) be the reﬂected wave; and

˜z = exp i(˜k · x − ωt). u(z) is the incident wave (from the left) and u(˜z) the reﬂected

wave and R(k) the reﬂection amplitude. The wave on the left is:

Substituting in the boundary conditions, using Eq. (24) and linearity, one ﬁnds

u(z) + R(k) u(˜z),

x < 0.

R(k) =

k
¯k

.

(25)

(26)

The phase of the reﬂected wave has an interesting dependence on the direction of

incidence: It goes from 1 for normal reﬂection to −1 for grazing reﬂection. This

is quite unlike the reﬂection of say longitudinal sound waves in an incompressible

liquid where the reﬂection amplitude is independent of the direction of incidence.

So, viscosity waves, have some peculiar features. Unfortunately, this example of

viscosity waves relies heavily on the fact that the medium is perfectly compressible,

9

which seems unreasonable for a realistic medium. What incompressibility does to

viscosity waves is analyzed in the next paragraph.

Incompressible Media: Consider an incompressible medium where ∇ · u = 0. For

a plane wave this means that Ω is parallel to k, that is:

Ω ∧ k = 0, ⇔ 0 = ηA

ijklkjkkkl.

(27)

A viscosity wave propagating in the 1 direction of an incompressible medium must

have ηA

i111 = 0 for all i. In particular it follows:

Corollary: There are no odd viscosity waves in planar, two dimensional, isotropic

and incompressible ﬂuids.

This is so because in two dimensions isotropic ﬂuids the non zero component of

the isotropic odd viscosity are ηa = −ηA

1222 = ηA

2111. For an isotropic ﬂuid we can

choose the 1 axis to coincide with the wave vector, and then incompressibility says

that ηa = ηA

2111 = 0.

This result carries over to plates. That is, consider a two dimensional planar

medium embedded in three dimensions.

It seems, at ﬁrst, that one can use the

freedom oﬀered by motions in the transversal direction to satisfy the constraint

of incompressiblity. This is, however, not the case. One can, indeed, compensate

for planar compression by transverse displacement, but one can not compensate

for planar decompression by motion in the transverse direction. Since a viscosity

wave has both compression and decompression, both can not be compensated by

transverse displacement of a planar plate4. As a consequence of this it follows that

there are no viscosity waves in a planar two dimensional incompressible quantum
4This argument fails for a curved surface like a spherical shell which presumably do support

viscosity waves.

10

Hall ﬂuid.

Geometric Acoustics: Using the rules of geometric acoustics it is straightforward

to ﬁnd the laws of reﬂection and refraction of an acoustic wave (in a medium where

η = 0) from an interface with a viscous medium (where the stress is dominated

by ηA).

If we let y be the axis separating the two media, then k2 is conserved

and so is the frequency ω. Let θ be the angle of incidence, cos(θ) = ˆx · ˆki, of an

acoustic wave with sound velocity cs and φ the angle of the transmitted viscosity

wave, cos(φ) = ˆx · ˆkt . Then a little geometry shows that

sin2 φ = ε sin2 θ,

ε =

ηω
ρc2
s

.

(28)

We see that ε−1/2 plays the role of the index of reﬂection. Since ε is normally small,

the index of reﬂection is large, and the transmitted beam is essentially normal to

the interface. Since the index depends on ω the reﬂection is dispersive.

Odd Viscosity as Polarizer: Consider a wave propagating in the x direction, of

a three dimensional incompressible medium, so that to the left there is an isotropic

elastic medium with velocities of sound ct and cℓ. To the right is a viscous (possibly

incompressible) medium. Incompressibility says that Ω(k) points in the x direction.

The y − z plane separates the two media. Let

e+ = (0, 1, i),

e− = (0, 1, −i),

(29)

denote the two basic vectors of circular polarization. Consider scattering of a trans-

verse wave with positive chirality from the y−z interface. The incoming and reﬂected

waves in the elastic medium are

e+

exp ik(x − ctt) + r exp ik(−x − ctt)

x < 0.

(30)

,
(cid:17)

(cid:16)

11

The transmitted wave (necessarily with positive chirality) is:

t e+ exp i(˜kx − ωt),

x > 0.

(31)

Where ω = kct = |Ω(˜k)|. The basic boundary conditions matches σL

1j on the left

with σR

1j on the right. One checks that σL

11 = σR

11 = 0 and that iσR

12 = σR

13. iσL

13

is automatically satisﬁed ( conﬁrming the anzatz that there is no reﬂected wave with

ﬂipped chirality). The remaining equation, σL

12 = σR

12, gives

1 − r = εt,

ε =

(33)

Note that |r| ≤ 1 as it should: The reﬂected wave always has smaller amplitude

than the incident wave. However, for t one gets an unusual behavior: 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 and

the amplitude t is maximal for ε = 0 when the amplitude of the transmitted wave

is twice as large as that of the incident wave! This surprise is mitigated when one

notices that for the energy ﬂux in the x direction, J1, the dependence on ε is

ε
(1+ε)2 ,

which gives maximal ﬂux at ε = 1 as one expects, since in this case r = 0. The wave

Consider now the scattering of a wave so that the incident wave has negative

chirality. The most general transverse wave in the elastic medium with the given

is perfectly transmitted.

incident wave is:

re+ exp ik(−x − ctt) + e− (exp ik(x − ctt) + ˜r exp ik(−x − ctt)) ,

(34)

while the wave in the viscous medium is as before. Matching σL

1j with σR

1j one ﬁnds

that as before σL

11 = σR

11 = 0 and iσR

12 = σR

13. Writing out iσL

12 = σL

13 gives: ˜r = 1.

12

The remaining equation, σL

12 = σR

12, gives

r = εt.

(35)

This is all that follows from the continuity of the three stress components. Imposing

continuity of the wave on the boundary gives two new equations:

r = t,

1 + ˜r = 0.

(36)

The second equation is in conﬂict with the equation for the continuity of the stress5.

The way out is not to require continuity of the wave, but instead continuity of the

energy ﬂux. This holds if the ﬂux vanishes at the surface and sets r = t = 0. The

incident wave with the wrong polarization is totally reﬂected. To sum up we see

that a viscous incompressible media with odd viscosity act as circular polarizers.

Navier Stokes equation: Let me now look at the Navier Stokes equation, for

homogeneous (ρ = 1), isotropic and incompressible ﬂuid in two dimensions–the one

dimension where odd viscosity is compatible with isotropy.

With broken time reversal, the general Navier-Stokes equation for the pressure p

and the velocity ﬁeld v, is the obvious generalization of the standard Navier-Stokes

equation [3]:

∂tv + (v · ∇)v = −∇p + ηs∆v − ηa∆v∗; ∇ · v = 0.

(37)

The dual is deﬁned, as usual, by

v∗
i = ǫijvj.
(38)
5This is the generic situation in scattering of acoustic and viscosity waves. That is, in general

imposing continuity of the wave across the interface gives an overdetermined system.

In this

sense, the previous example is exceptional in that both the stress and the wave turned out to be

continuous.

13

Incompressibility is implemented by introducing a stream function and the equations

can be alternatively written as four equations for the four ﬁelds (p, ψ, v):

∂tv + (v · ∇)v = −∇(p − ηaξ) + ηs∆v; v = (∇ψ)∗,

ξ = −∆ψ.

(39)

Taking curl the equation for the vorticity is

∂tξ + (v · ∇) ξ = ηs∆ξ.

(40)

Vorticity can be generated only by the symmetric (dissipative) part of the viscosity

tensor. The odd viscosity does not generate vorticity.

Bernoulli Law: Consider incompressible ﬂuid in two dimensions, with ηs = 0, in

steady state. The equation of motion is:

(v · ∇)v = −∇(p − ηaξ).

(41)

Since

1
2

∇(v2) = (v · ∇)v + v × (∇ × v) = −∇(p − ηaξ) + v × (∇ × v),

(42)

one gets, by integrating along a streamline, that

1
2

v2 + p − ηaξ = const.

(43)

This looks at ﬁrst like a generalization of Bernoulli’s law to odd viscosity with the

pleasant feature that the vorticity (weighted by the odd viscosity) plays a role of

(signed) kinetic energy. However, as vorticity is conserved along a streamline, it is

actually precisely equivalent to Bernoulli’s law.

Stokes Equation: The limit of small Reynolds number is described by Stokes

equation. This is the case where normally viscosity dominates. Stokes equation

14

is linear, so this is also the easy limit. In the present context, with broken time

reversal, and for two dimensional isotropic and incompressible ﬂuid:

∂tv = −∇(p − ηaξ) + ηs∆v; v = (∇ψ)∗.

Taking curl and div we get:

∂tξ = ηs∆ξ,

0 = −∆(p − ηaξ).

In a steady state, if ηS 6= 0, both the pressure and the vorticity must be harmonic

functions and ψ bi-harmonic.

Rotating Circles: Consider a rigid disc which is rotating with constant (and

small) angular velocity Ω in a ﬂuid subject to no-slip boundary conditions. Stokes

equation can be solved explicitly in this case [7, 8]. I will show that while the ordinary

viscosity applies a torque that resists the rotation of the disc, the odd viscosity leads

to a pressure on the disc which is proportional to the angular velocity. The pressure

could be either positive or negative, depending on the sense of rotation.

Written in complex notation Stokes equation read:

¯∂ (p + iηξ) = 0,

η = ηs + iηa.

Since ψ is bi-harmonic and real

− 2iψ = z a(x) − ¯z a(z) + b(z) − b(z).

Let v = v1 + iv2. Using

one ﬁnds

v = −2i ¯∂ψ,

ξ = −2i∂v.

v = −a(z) + z a′(z) − b′(z),

ξ = 2i(a′(z) − a′(z)).

It then also follows that p is a constant. Using the velocity ﬁeld one ﬁnds the strain

on the surface of the circle:

˙u11 = −Ω sin(2θ),

˙u12 = Ω cos(2θ),

˙u22 = Ω sin(2θ).

(54)

Here x = |z| cos θ. Let us write the stress as σ = σs + σa. Then

ij = 2 ηs ˙uij.

continuous solutions for the velocity ﬁeld.

16

This says that the symmetric viscosity resists the rotation by applying a torque

on the rotating circle. The odd viscosity applies no torque, but instead, a normal

pressure on the circle, which is proportional to the rate of rotation.

Remark: One could have also asked what is the eﬀect of odd viscosity on the

drag and lift (the Magnus force). Unfortunately, for an incompressible, viscous ﬂuid

in two dimensions the question is moot: Stokes equation in two dimension does

not admit steady state solutions that describe a moving disc with no slip boundary

conditions in a ﬂuid that is at rest at inﬁnity. Two dimensions behave like one

dimension and unlike three dimensions. This is known as the Whitehead paradox7.

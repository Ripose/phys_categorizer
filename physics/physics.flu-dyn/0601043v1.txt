Two more restrictively general stability criterions of two-dimensional inviscid parallel ﬂow are
obtained analytically. First, a criterion for stability is found as f (y) = U ′′
U −Us > −µ1 everywhere
in the ﬂow, where Us is the velocity at inﬂection point, µ1 is eigenvalue of Poincar´e’s problem.
Second, the connection between present criterion and Arnol’d’s nonlinear criterion is discussed.
Then the viscosity’s dual roles in hydrodynamic stabilities are also explained both mathematically
and physically. We highlight the point that an additional viscous diﬀusion competing with a less
eﬃcient wave radiation in the viscous ﬂows is the reason. These results extend the former theorems
obtained by Rayleigh, Tollmien and Fjørtoft and will lead future works to investigate the mechanism
of hydrodynamic instability.

The hydrodynamic instability is a fundamental prob-
lem in many ﬁelds, such as ﬂuid dynamics, astrodynam-
ics, oceanography, meteorology et al. There are many
kinds of hydrodynamic instability, e.g. shear instability
due to velocity shear, thermal instability due to heating,
viscous instability due to viscosity, centrifugal instability
due to rotation and the instability due to stratiﬁcation.
Among them, the inviscid shear instability is the most
simple but important one, which has been explored by
many scientists (see [1, 2, 3] and references therein). For
the investigation of shear instability is great helpful for
understanding other instabilities in shear ﬂows. The gen-
eral way to study the problem is investigating the growth
of linear disturbances by means of normal mode expan-
sion, which leads to famous Rayleigh equation [4]. Using
this equation, Rayleigh [4] ﬁrst proved a necessary crite-
rion for instability, i.e. Inﬂection Point Theorem. Then,
Fjørtoft [5] found a stronger necessary criterion for insta-
bility. These theorems are well known and are applied to
understand the mechanism of hydrodynamic instability
[1, 2, 3]. Unfortunately, both theorems are only necessary
criterions for instability. The lack of suﬃcient criterion
baﬄes the thorough comprehension for hydrodynamic in-
stability in inviscid ﬂows. So that the aim of this letter is
to obtain the criterion for these ﬂows, thus other insta-
bilities may be understanded via the investigation here.

To this purpose, Rayleigh equation for an inviscid par-
allel ﬂow is employed [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]. For a parallel ﬂow
with mean velocity U (y), the streamfunction of the dis-
turbance expands as series of waves (normal modes) with
real wavenumber k and complex frequency ω = ωr + iωi,
where ωi relates to the grow rate of the waves. The ﬂow
is unstable if and only if ωi > 0. We study the stability of
the disturbances by investigating the growth rate of the
waves, this method is known as normal mode method.

The real part of complex phase speed cr = ωr/k is the

There are three main categories boundaries: (i) enclosed
channels for both a and b being ﬁnite, (ii) boundary layer
for either a or b being inﬁnity, and (iii) free shear ﬂows
for both a and b being inﬁnity.

It is obvious that the criterion for stability is ωi = 0
(ci = 0), for the complex conjugate quantities φ∗ and
c∗ are also the physical solution of Eq.(1) and Eq.(2).
From Rayleigh equation, we get the following equations
by multiplying the complex conjugate φ∗ to Eq.(1) and

Rayleigh used only Eq.(4) to prove his theorem. Fjørtoft
noted that Eq.(3) should also be satisﬁed, then he proved
his necessary criterion. To ﬁnd a suﬃcient criterion, we
shall investigate the conditions for ci = 0. Unlike the
former proofs, we consider this problem in a totally dif-
ferent way: if the velocity proﬁle is stable (ci = 0), then
the hypothesis ci 6= 0 should result in contradictions in
some cases. Following this way, some more restrictive
criterions can be obtained.

The smallest eigenvalue value, namely µ1, can be esti-

Then there is a criterion for stability using Poincar´e’s
relation (5), a new stability criterion may be found: the
ﬂow is stable if U ′′
U−Us > −µ1 everywhere.
To get this criterion, we introduce an auxiliary function
f (y) = U ′′
U−Us , where f (y) is ﬁnite at inﬂection point. We
will prove the criterion by two steps. At ﬁrst, we prove
result 1: if the velocity proﬁle is subject to f (y) > −µ1,
then cr can not be Us.
Proof: Otherwise,

−µ1 <

(7)

This contradicts Eq.(3). So result 1 is proved.

Then, we prove result 2: if −µ1 < f (y) and cr 6= Us,

there must be c2

i = 0.

Proof: Otherwise if c2

i 6= 0, then multiplying Eq.(4) by
(Us − Ut)/ci, where the arbitrary real number Ut which
does not depend on y, and adding the result to Eq.(3),
it holds

(8)

But the above Eq.(8) can not be hold for some special
Ut. For example, let Ut = 2cr − Us, then there is (U −
Us)(U − Ut) < kU − ck2, and

U ′′(U − Ut)
kU − ck2 = f (y)

(U − Us)(U − Ut)

(10)

which also contradicts Eq.(8). So the second result is also
proved.

Using ’result 1:

if f (y) > −µ1 then cr 6= Us’ and
if f (y) > −µ1 and cr 6= Us then ci = 0’, we

’result 2:
ﬁnd a stability criterion.

Theorem 1: If the velocity proﬁle satisfy U ′′

U−Us > −µ1

everywhere in the ﬂow, it is stable.

FIG. 1: vorticity proﬁles, proﬁle 2 ( ξ = cos(πy/2), dashed)
is neutrally stable, while proﬁle 1 (ξ = cos(y), solid) and
proﬁle 3 (ξ = cos(2y), dash doted) are stable and unstable,
respectively.

This criterion is more restrictive than Fjørtoft’s the-
orem. As known from Fjørtoft’s theorem, the neces-
sary condition for instability is that the base vorticity
ξ = −U ′ has a local maximal in the proﬁle. Noting that
U ′′/(U −Us) ≈ ξ′′
s /ξs near the inﬂection point, where ξs is
the vorticity at inﬂection point, it means the base vortic-
ity ξ must be convex enough near the local maximum for
instability, i.e. the vorticity should be concentrated on
somewhere in the ﬂow for instability. A simple example
can be given by following Tollmien’s way. As shown in
Fig.1, there are three vorticity proﬁles, which have local
maximal at y = 0. Proﬁle 2 (U = −2 sin(πy/2)/π) is neu-
trally stable, while proﬁle 1 (U = − sin(y)) and proﬁle 3
(U = − sin(2y)/2) are stable and unstable, respectively.
The criterion proved above may shed light on the in-
vestigation of vortex dynamics. Both Theorem 1 and
Fig.1 show that it is the vorticity proﬁle rather than the
velocity proﬁle that dominates the stability of the ﬂow.
This means that the distribution of vorticity dominates
the shear instability in parallel inviscid ﬂow, which is of
essence for understanding the role of vorticity in ﬂuid. So
a unstable ﬂow might be controlled just by adjusting the
vorticity distribution according to present results. For
example, This is an very fascinating problem, but can
not be discussed in detail here.

To show the power of the criterions obtained above,
we consider the stability of velocity proﬁle U = tanh(αy)
within the interval −1 ≤ y ≤ 1, where α is a con-
stant parameter. This velocity proﬁle is an classical
model of mixing layer’s one, and was investigated by
many researchers (see [1, 3, 6] and references therein).

Since U ′′(U − Us) = −2α2 tanh
(αy) < 0 for
−1 ≤ y ≤ 1, it might be unstable according to both
Rayleigh’s and Fjørtoft’s theorems. But it can be derived
from Theorem 1 that the ﬂow is stable for α2 < π2/8.
For example, we choose α1 = 1.1 and α2 = 1.3 for ve-
locity proﬁles U1(y) and U2(y). The growth rate of the
proﬁles can be obtained by Chebyshev spectral colloca-

tion method [6] with 100 collocation points, as shown in
Fig.2. It is obvious that ci = 0 for U1 and ci > 0 for U2,
which agree well with the theorems obtained above. This
is also a counterexample that Fjørtoft’s theorems is not
suﬃcient for instability. So the new criterion for stability
is very useful for applications.

As mentioned above, we have investigated the stability
of waves via Rayleigh equation, while Arnol’d [8, 9] inves-
tigated hydrodynamic stability in a totally diﬀerent way.
He investigated the conservation law of the inviscid ﬂow
via Euler’s equation and found two nonlinear stability
conditions by means of variational principle.

It is very interesting that the linear stability criterions
match Arnol’d’s nonlinear stability theorems very well.
Apply Arnol’d’s First Stability Theorem to parallel ﬂow,
a stable criterion is 0 < C1 < (U − Us)/U ′′ < C2 < ∞
everywhere in the ﬂow, where C1 and C2 are constants.
This corresponds to Fjørtoft’s criterion for linear stabil-
ity, and is well known [2, 10]. Here we ﬁnd that The-
orem 1 proved above corresponds to Arnol’d’s Second
Stability Theorem, i.e., a stable criterion is 0 < C1 <
−(U − Us)/U ′′ < C2 < ∞ everywhere in the ﬂow. Given
C1 = 1/µ1, Theorem 1 is equivalent to Arnol’d’s Second
Stability Theorem. Moreover, the proofs here are some-
thing like Arnol’d’s variational principle method. For
the arbitrary real number Ut, like Lagrange multiplier

3

in variational principle method, plays a key role in the
proofs.

However, unfortunately Arnol’d’s nonlinear stability
theorems, though very important, are seldom known by
the scientists in other ﬁelds. The main reason is that
the proofs of Arnol’d’s theorems are very advanced and
complex in mathematics for most general scientists in dif-
ferent ﬁelds to understand. Although Dowling [10] sug-
gested that Arnol’d’s idea needs to be added to the gen-
eral ﬂuid-dynamics curriculum, his suggestion can’t be
followed even after 10 years later. Contrast the theorems
proved here with Arnol’d’s theorems, they are equiva-
lence in a sense but much more simple and easy to under-
stand, then it is more convenient to use our new theorems
in applications.

An interesting question is which one would be the
marginal criterion for inviscid parallel ﬂows, U ′′(U − Us)
or U ′′/(U − Us)? This question emerges from the note
that the criterions in theorems are diﬀerent from each
others, e.g. U ′′(U − Us) for Fjørtoft’s, (U − Us)/U ′′ for
Arnol’d’s and U ′′/(U −Us) for present works. This diﬀer-
ence is not remarkable in some cases, e.g. U ′′(U −Us) > 0
equals to (U − Us)/U ′′ > 0. But the marginal criterion
should be function of U ′′/(U − Us) but not U ′′(U − Us) in
general cases. It can be seen from Eq.(1) that the stabil-
ity of proﬁle U (y) is not only Galilean invariant of U (y),
but also magnitude free of U (y) due to linearity. So the
stability of U (y) is the same with that of AU (y) + B,
where A and B are any arbitrary nonzero real number.
As the value of U ′′(U − Us) is only Galilean invariant but
not magnitude free, it should not be the the marginal
criterion. On the other hand the value of U ′′/(U − Us)
satisﬁes both conditions, this is the reason why the crite-
rions in Arnol’d’s theorems and present theorems are the
functions of U ′′/(U − Us). Since the stability of inviscid
parallel ﬂow depends only on the velocity proﬁle’s geome-
try shape, namely f (y), and the magnitude of the velocity
proﬁle can be free, then the instability of inviscid parallel
ﬂows should properly be called ”geometry shape instabil-
ity” of the velocity proﬁle. This distinguishes from the
viscous instability associated to the magnitude of the ve-
locity proﬁle in the following discussion.

Within the discussion above, the role of viscosity in
hydrodynamic instability can be considered in perspec-
tive. As well known, there is a paradox about viscous
diﬀusion. Though viscous diﬀusion can damping the dis-
turbance, a inviscidly stable ﬂow might be instable by
taking into account viscosity. It is explained physically
that the viscosity has production eﬀects on the distur-
bance via Reynolds stress [3]. Here we explain this in a
diﬀerent way.

Mathematically, the stability problem in viscous ﬂow
has three notable diﬀerences from that in inviscid one,
and they are outlined brieﬂy here. Firstly, the concep-
tion of ”geometry shape instability” in the inviscid paral-
lel ﬂows is not valid anymore. For example, the Reynolds
number for U (y) is diﬀerent from that for AU (y), where
A is any arbitrary nonzero number. This is because the

Reynolds number associates to the magnitude of velocity
in the viscous ﬂows. Secondly, Rayleigh equation is sym-
metry with complex conjugate, while viscous equation
is asymmetry. As mentioned above, both the complex
pair (c, φ) and the corresponding complex conjugate pair
(c∗, φ∗) are solutions of Rayleigh equation. Thus ci 6= 0
infers instability in inviscid ﬂow. But in Orr-Sommerfeld
equation (not shown) for viscous ﬂows, either the com-
plex pair (c, φ) or the corresponding complex conjugate
pair (c∗, φ∗) can be the solution. Thus, only ci > 0 infers
instability in viscous ﬂows. Thirdly, the instability due
to the viscosity is related to the ”non-normal” growth of
disturbance. For in Rayleigh equation the linear diﬀer-
ential operator is ”normal”, thus the linear criterions are
equivalent to nonlinear ones. In consequence, there is no
transient growth in inviscid parallel ﬂows. However, tak-
ing the viscous term into Eq.(1) makes Rayleigh equation
change into Orr-Sommerfeld equation, which is known as
”non-normal” (see [1, 11] and references therein). In this
case, non-normal growth of disturbances can be ampli-
ﬁed.

Physically, the introducing of the viscosity restricts
the permissible waves in the viscous ﬂows. According to
the boundary conditions, in the inviscid ﬂows the distur-
bance waves which satisfy only non-penetration bound-
ary conditions at the walls can propagate. While in the
viscous ﬂows, only those waves which satisfy both non-
penetration conditions and no-slip conditions at the walls
can propagate. So the permissible waves in viscous ﬂows
are much less than those in inviscid ﬂows. As well known,
there are three kinds of ways for disturbances evolving in
the ﬂow: (i) advection by mean ﬂow, (ii) radiation by
waves and (iii) diﬀusion by viscosity. In general, (i) is
trivial in both viscous ﬂows and inviscid ﬂows, whereas
(ii) and (iii) play key roles in damping the disturbances.
Here we point out that the viscosity plays dual roles

4

in the instability of ﬂows. On one hand, the viscous
diﬀusion always has stabilizing inﬂuence to the waves.
Unfortunately on the other hand, the viscosity restricts
severely the permissible waves thus obstructs the radia-
tion of disturbance by waves. Then the radiation of dis-
turbance in viscous ﬂows is much less eﬃcient than that
in inviscid ﬂows. Contrast this with the radiation in the
inviscid ﬂows. An additional viscous diﬀusion competes
with a less eﬀective wave radiation in the viscous ﬂows.
In this way, the viscosity plays a dual roles in the stability
of ﬂows. This is the reason why a inviscidly stable ﬂow
might be unstable at high Reynolds number, for there is
less diﬀusion and less radiation in this case. In addition,
this can also explain why the viscosity is not essential
in free shear ﬂows [1]. For there is no rigid wall in free
shear ﬂows, thus the radiation in viscous ﬂow could be
as eﬃcient as that in inviscid case, i.e. inviscid stability
dominates the stability of inviscid ﬂow.

In summery, the general stability criterions are ob-
tained for inviscid parallel ﬂow. These results extend
the former theorems proved by Rayleigh, Tollmien and
Fjørtoft, and they are equivalent to Arnol’d’s nonlinear
theorems. The viscosity’s dual roles in hydrodynamic
stabilities are also explained both in mathematics and in
physics. We highlight the point that an additional vis-
cous diﬀusion competing with a less eﬀective wave radi-
ation in the viscous ﬂows is the reason. In general, these
criterions will lead future works to investigate the mech-
anism of hydrodynamic instability and to understand the
mechanism of turbulence. And it also shed light on the
ﬂow control and investigation of the vortex dynamics.

The work was original from author’s dream of under-
standing the mechanism of instability in the year 2000,
when the author was a graduated student and learned
the course of hydrodynamic stability by Prof. Yin X-Y

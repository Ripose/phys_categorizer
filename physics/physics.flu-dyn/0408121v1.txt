INTRODUCTION

The desiccated sessile drops attract the attention be-
cause of diﬀerent reasons and possible applications. If a
drop of pure liquid dries on a smooth substrate, then the
base of the drop shrinks but the contact angle remains
ﬁxed. Under evaporation, a drop of colloidal suspension
or solution having a strongly anchored three phase line
keeps a spherical-cap shape with a constant base. The
contact angle decreases with time and the height in each
point of the proﬁle decreases. To satisfy the anchoring
condition, a ﬂow of liquid has to occur inside the drop.
An outward ﬂow in a drying drop is produced when the
contact line is pinned so that liquid that is removed by
evaporation from the edge of the drop must be replen-
ished by a ﬂow of liquid from the interior [1, 2, 3]. This
ﬂow is capable of transferring 100% of the solute to the
contact line and thus accounts for the strong perimeter
concentration of many stains. Ring formation in an evap-
orating sessile drop is a hydrodynamic process in which
solids dispersed in the drop are advected to the contact
line. After all the liquid evaporates, a ring-shaped de-
posit is left on the substrate that contains almost all the
solute. Perhaps, everybody knows a dense, ring-like de-
posit along the perimeter of a dried drop of coﬀee or tee,
milk or juice on a table.

Exploratory experiments [3] using a variety of car-
rier ﬂuids, solutes, and substrates indicated that pref-
erential deposition at the contact line is insensitive to
a wide range of experimental conditions. Ringlike de-
posits were observed whenever the surface was partially
wet by the ﬂuid irrespective of the chemical composition
of the substrate. Diﬀerent substrates were investigated
(metal, polyethylene, roughened Teﬂon, freshly cleaved
mica, ceramic, and silicon). Rings were found in big
drops (15 cm) and in small drops (1 mm). They were
found with aqueous and non-aqueous (acetone, methanol,
toluene, and ethanol) solvents. They were found with
solutes ranging in size from the molecular (sugar and
dye molecules) to the colloidal (10 µm polystyrene micro-
spheres) and with solute volume fractions ranging from
10−6 to 10−1. Likewise, environmental conditions such
as temperature, humidity, and pressure could be exten-
sively varied without aﬀecting the ring. Eﬀects due to

solute diﬀusion, gravity, electrostatic ﬁelds, and surface
tension forces are negligible in ring formation.

The vertically averaged radial ﬂow of the ﬂuid in a des-
iccated sessile drop was calculated in the work [1]. The
conservation of ﬂuid was utilized. A constant evapora-
tion rate all over drop free surface was assumed.

For the case where the limiting rate is the diﬀusion of
the liquid vapor, the evaporation of the drop rapidly at-
tains a steady state so that the diﬀusion equation reduces
to Laplaces equation [3]. In this case the evaporation rate
is larger near the contact line and the resulting ringlike
deposit is more concentrated at the edge.

The models [1] and [3] deal with the vertically averaged
radial ﬂow of the ﬂuid. The next Section describes how
to obtain the space distribution of the ﬂuid ﬂow.

II. MODEL AND RESULTS

Likewise the works [1, 2, 3],

let us suppose, that
the shape of the drop is a spherical cap.
It means
that the drop is small and a spherical cap shape in-
duced by surface tension (Bond number smaller than one:
Bo = g(ρ − ρf )d2σ−1 ≪ 1, where g is gravitational ac-
celeration, ρ is drop density, ρf is surrounding medium
density , σ is surface tension, d is drop diameter). The
problem of a spherical cap on an impermeable substrate
can be replaced by the problem of a lens. Let us con-
sider an extremely simple situation when the cap is a
semi-sphere, i.e. the contact angle is 90◦.

Under evaporation, the height in each point of the pro-
ﬁle decreases. Nevertheless, under room condition the
evaporation is a slow process. So, the desiccation time of
a 15 mg sessile water drop is larger then 3500 s [4]. This
fact gives a possibility to consider a quasi-static process.
We will consider a drop with a ﬁxed free surface and
the speciﬁc boundary conditions. Quasi-static approxi-
mation was utilized in [3] to obtain a vapor rate near the
free surface, too.

Let us suppose that the evaporation rate is uniform all
over drop free surface, i.e. we will consider only begin
of the evaporation. The conservation of ﬂuid determines
the relationship between the velocity of the free surface,
un, the normal to the free surface ﬂow of the ﬂuid, vn,
and the rate of mass loss per unit surface area per unit
time from the drop by evaporation, J:

Let us consider the potential ﬂow, only. The poten-
tial of the velocity ﬁeld, ϕ, is a solution of the Laplace’s
equation

∆ϕ = 0.

(1)

Also, we will solve the Laplace’s equation inside a spher-
ical area using spherical coordinates .

Measurements of the evolution of the drying drop
height h with time t can be performed. Let us suppose,
that the velocity of the drop height, u0, is known. Thus
un = u0 cos θ, where θ is azimuthal angle. The volume of
the drop is decreasing due to evaporation:

Eq. 6 is always valid, if Ak = bkR/k. Hence, the

coeﬃcients of the series (3) are

The capillary ﬂow carries a ﬂuid from the apex of the

drop to the contact line (Fig. 1).

III. DISCUSSION

It is clear, more realistic assumption, that a drop has a
spherical cap shape with an arbitrary contact angle, can
not change the qualitative picture of the ﬂow. In partic-
ularly, the calculations of the vertically averaged velocity
for the drops with the contact angles up to 90◦ [1] did
not show the qualitative changes of the ﬂow. If a drop
has a spherical cap shape with an arbitrary contact angle
the Laplace’s equation can be solved using toroidal co-
ordinates. Although, the analytical results are too com-
plicate in this case, and numerical calculations should be
performed. Nonuniform evaporation rate can not change
the results qualitative, but the line, where vr(R) = 0, has
to move to the base.

Recently, the buckling instability was investigated dur-
ing the drying of sessile drops of colloidal suspensions
or of polymer solutions [5, 6, 7]. Under solvent evap-
oration, disperse particles or polymers accumulate near
the vapor–drop interface. The outer layer of the drop

is more concentrated in the polymer and may display a
gel or glassy transition and, hence, may form a perme-
able rigid gelled or glassy skin. This skin behaves like an
elastic shell although it does not block the evaporation.
This gelled or glassy skin will thus bend as the volume it
encloses decreases, leading to large surface distortions.

The processes of skin formation are not the scope of
this brief communication. Nevertheless, knowledge of the
velocity ﬁeld inside an evaporating sessile drop is a neces-
sary background to describe the colloidal particles trans-
fer or solute diﬀusion, and skin formation.

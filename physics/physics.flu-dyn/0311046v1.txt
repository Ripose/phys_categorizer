The production of small ﬂuid droplets relies on an instability of solutions to the Young-Laplace
equation. We investigate the dependence of this instability on the boundary; in particular, we ask
whether smaller droplets can be produced by changing the shape of the nozzle. We ﬁnd that at a
given critical pressure, the circular nozzle actually produces the largest droplet, and that the droplet
volume can be decreased by up to 21% using a triangular nozzle with stretched corners.

PACS numbers: 68.03.Cd, 47.20.Dr, 02.30.Xx

A standard protocol for producing small droplets is as
follows: a pipette, of circular cross-section, is pressurized
at one end, pushing out a small ﬂuid droplet. If the noz-
zle is suﬃciently small, force balance requires that the
droplet has constant mean curvature. At a critical pres-
sure, this equilibrium shape becomes unstable, ultimately
leading to the droplet detaching from the nozzle.

The volume of ﬂuid entrained during this process is set
by the total ﬂuid volume contained in the critical droplet.
This volume scales like r3, where r is the nozzle radius.
On the other hand, the critical pressure for ejecting this
droplet scales like γ/r, where γ is the liquid surface ten-
sion. Thus, ejecting small droplets requires increasingly
higher pressures. The smallest size droplet that can be
ejected is thus determined by the highest pressure that
can be reliably applied to the nozzle, without material
failure, etc.

One strategy for creating smaller droplets than those
dictated by the instability of a static droplet is to use
a time varying forcing at the nozzle. This method has
achieved an order of magnitude decrease in droplet vol-
ume [1].

However, all of the nozzles that we are aware of use a
circular cross section. It is not unreasonable to imagine
that by changing the shape of the cross section to be some
other shape, it might be possible to decrease the ejected
droplet volume while maintaining the same applied pres-
sure. For example, imagine that we have a circular nozzle
with a pendant droplet just below the critical volume: by
“squeezing” the shape of the nozzle cross-section into an
elliptical shape, one might cause the droplet to detach at
a lower volume.

In this paper, we address the question: what is the
shape of a nozzle for which the ejected droplet volume is
minimized, for a given applied pressure? We demonstrate
that circular nozzles do not eject the smallest droplets; in-
stead, the optimal nozzle more closely resembles an equi-
lateral triangle, albeit with “stretched” corners. The best
nozzle shape that we have found has an ejected droplet
volume about twenty percent smaller than the circular
nozzle with the same critical pressure. Our method is
inspired by and extends J. Keller’s classic treatment of

the Euler buckling problem with a beam of nonuniform
cross-section [2]. Recently, the method has been success-
ful applied to the optimization of a bistable switch [3].

To answer this question, we will ﬁrst ﬁnd the nozzle
with smallest critical volume for a ﬁxed nozzle area. If
the typical radius of the nozzle r is much smaller than
γ/(ρmg), where γ is the surface
the capillary length
tension, ρm is the ﬂuid mass density and g is the grav-
itational acceleration, then gravitational eﬀects can be
neglected, and the ﬂuid surface has constant mean cur-
vature

p

K[R] = p,

(1)

where R = R(θ, φ) parameterizes the droplet shape in
spherical coordinates, K[R] is the mean curvature of
this solution, and p is the pressure. We choose γ = 1
henceforth, so pressure will have dimension of inverse
length. Continuously increasing p from zero leads to
droplet shapes of larger and larger volumes. At a criti-
cal p there is a bifurcation point above which no stable
solutions exist.

The existence of a bifurcation point (where two con-
stant mean curvature solutions coincide at the same pres-
sure) is easy to understand in the case of a circular nozzle:
at small p the solution is a slightly curved spherical cap
stretching across the nozzle. But note that the comple-
ment of this solution, the other portion of the sphere from
which the cap is cut out, is also a solution. This second
solution has a very large radius, and is unphysical. How-
ever, for generic values of p, there are two solutions. At
the critical pressure, these two solutions coincide. This
is the bifurcation point. From the well known expression

we deduce that this critical pressure p∗ is related to the
nozzle radius r by

Ksphere =

2
radius

,

∗

p

=

2
r

.

Note that for pressures greater than p∗ no constant
mean curvature solutions exist because that would re-
quire drops smaller than the nozzle.

Now, for a general nozzle shape the bifurcation condi-
tion follows from the requirement that equation (1) re-
mains valid under a variation of R → R + δR, with the
pressure unchanged to leading order. This requirement
yields a homogeneous linear diﬀerential equation for the
variation δR = w

ˆLw = 0,
(2)
where ˆL is a diﬀerential operator obtained from consid-
ering the variation of the mean curvature with respect

to change in shape, and w vanishes at the nozzle.
order to use this bifurcation condition to determine the
critical pressure, it is necessary to ﬁrst solve equation (1)
for R(θ, φ) given p, and then determine for which p = p∗
does a nontrivial solution to equation (2) exist.

In general, the critical pressure p∗ is a functional of the
nozzle shape c(φ). We wish to derive a formula relating
change in the critical pressure to change in the nozzle
shape. If the nozzle shape changes from c → c + δc, then
the droplet shape will change from R → R + δR and the
critical pressure changes from p → p + δp.

Representing the drop surface as a height function over
the plane of the nozzle yields a simple form for the mean
curvature. But this coordinate system is poorly suited for
critical drops because the slope diverges at the boundary,
as in the hemisphere. Instead we adopt the coordinates:

x = tan

cos φ,

y = tan

sin φ.

θ

(cid:19)

θ

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

This maps the unit hemisphere, parametrized by θ and
φ, into a unit disk in the xy-plane. Then a drop surface
can be described by the radius as a function of our new
“cartesian” coordinates: R(x, y). Note that the shape of
the nozzle translates into a Dirichlet boundary condition
which we can implement easily. An appealing feature of
the coordinate system is that the metric remains diago-
nal:

ds2 = dR2 + Γ(dx2 + dy2),

2

(4)

where ρ2 = x2 + y2.

Under a change of nozzle shape and/or pressure, (3)

must still hold. Hence the surface change δR satisﬁes

ˆLδR = δp

4R2
(1 + ρ2)2 ,

where the left side follows from varying the surface, and
the right side is from change in pressure. The boundary
condition is δR(ρ = 1) = δc(φ), where δc is the nozzle
change we impose. Generically, the surface and the pres-
sure must change together in order for (3) to hold, but at
a bifurcation point there is a nonvanishing δR for δp = 0
and δc = 0. We denote this homogeneous solution w:

ˆLw = 0,

with boundary condition w(ρ = 1) = 0.

The important feature of ˆL is that it is self-adjoint
upon integration in the xy-plane. This can be simply
understood as follows: the YL equation (3) is the ﬁrst
functional derivative of the free energy, so the inner prod-
uct

hf, ˆLgi ≡

dxdyf ˆLg

Z
is just the second functional derivative of the free energy,
where f and g are arbitrary functions. Self-adjointness
follows immediately from changing the order of diﬀer-
entiation. This means that interchanging f and g only
introduces a boundary integral, which is exactly what we
want.

If we evaluate the inner product of both sides of (4)

with w and invoke self-adjointness, we discover

hw, ˆLδRi = hδR, ˆLwi + b(w, δR) − b(δR, w)

= 0 + 0 − b(δc, w)

b(•, •) denotes the boundary integral from integrating by
parts. We now have an explicit relation between a change
in the nozzle shape and the resulting change in critical
pressure. One may object that p in the above expres-
sion can be any pressure, not just the critical pressure.
What allows us to identify δp as the change in critical
pressure is the fact that for a given nozzle the critical
pressure happens to be the maximum pressure obtain-
able. Heuristically, the space of critical pressures forms
a ridge in parameter space; if the system is sitting at a
point along the ridge, then a small change would bring
the system to a nearby point on the ridge, the deviation

away from critical being of higher order. The simpli-
ﬁcation is considerable because otherwise one needs to
consider the variation of the bifurcation equation (2) as
in [2, 3].

We can recast this expression into a form that is
more geometric. First, the contact angle α between the
drop and the plane of the nozzle is given by cot α(φ) =
Rρ/(R2 + R2
φ)1/2|ρ=1 where the right hand side is evalu-
ated at the boundary. Second, we deﬁne w⊥ ≡ wρ/(R2 +
φ)1/2|ρ=1 which can be understood as follows - recall
R2
that w is the diﬀerence between the outer and inner so-
lutions as the pressure approaches bifurcation. Using the
contact angle given above, this expression is the diﬀer-
ence between the slopes (with respect to the vertical) of
the outer and inner solutions at the boundary. This is a
coordinate independent quantity. Third, we observe that

where dl is the line element, and δN is the change of
the nozzle in the direction locally normal to the nozzle.
Lastly, the denominator in (5) is just the change in vol-
ume from changing the surface by w: δwV . Putting these
facts together, the pressure change is



δp =

which leads to the prescription for changing the nozzle

δN ∼

(6)

Clearly, for the circular nozzle, symmetry implies that
δN should be constant. But the area contraint forbids
such a change. So the circular nozzle is at an extremum,
in fact a minimum of critical pressure for ﬁxed nozzle
area.

For a noncircular nozzle, the contact angle isn’t con-
stant, and hence the change according to the above for-
mula cannot be constant. So one may change the critical
pressure while ﬁxing the nozzle area. Moreover, since the
circular nozzle is the only one (except the inﬁnite strip)
with a constant contact angle, the process of deformation
does not end.

We apply (6) iteratively to a perturbed circular noz-
zle to see how the shape evolves away from the circle.
Figure 1 shows the result of iterations starting with a
circle deformed by a perturbation with a three-fold sym-
metry. The perturbation grows with each iteration, and

a) Initial nozzle: ˜V = 1.00; b) ˜V = 0.99; c) ˜V = 0.90; d)
˜V = 0.82.

eventually the nozzle shape becomes concave. With each
iteration, we have applied a rescaling in order to maintain
the nozzle area. Without the area constraint, the nozzle
would become arbitrarily small in accordance with (6).
We are interested in the shape of the nozzle, not its size.
We also apply the Savitzky-Golay ﬁlter [4] at each itera-
tion to smooth out the mesh noise. The solutions to the
Young-Laplace equations are obtained using the nonlin-
r(cid:13) PDE Toolbox, which
ear PDE solver in the MATLAB
implements the ﬁnite element method for elliptic equa-
tions with variable coeﬃcients, exactly of the form in (3).
For each nozzle shape, we start at a pressure below the
bifurcation and by choosing diﬀerent trial solutions ob-
tain both solutions. Then we bring both solutions to just
below the critical pressure by stepping up the pressure,
using the solution at each step as the trial solution for the
next step. We then use the average of the two solutions
for our surface, and their diﬀerence for w. The validity
of this procedure can be rigorously shown for a circular
nozzle, and we expect it to remaind valid for noncircular
nozzles as long as the pressure is close to critical. Figure
2 is an example of a drop surface obtained with the PDE
solver, rendered in real space.

We can compare diﬀerent nozzle shapes by looking at

4

labeling the iterations and gives us a means of visualiz-
ing the dynamics deﬁned by the iteration procedure. We
see that the evolution of ˜V consists of an initial rapid
decrease and a subsequent leveling oﬀ. The two regimes
meet in the vicinity of the rounded triangular nozzle.
This means that in order to decrease droplet size at a
given pressure, one should use a nozzle shape that is
roughly triangular, perhaps with somewhat stretched out
corners; but further deformation does not lead to signif-
icant improvement. Moreover, gravitational instabilities
will inevitably become relevant if the “arms” become too
long [5, 6].

So far we have ignored the eﬀects of gravity, but our
formalism applies just as well to the problem with grav-
ity.
Including gravity means that the pressure would
no longer be constant throughout the drop surface, but
rather a linear function of height: p → p − ρmgh(x, y),
and p now denotes the pressure at the nozzle (h = 0).
Although (3) acquires a new term as a result, this term
does not contain derivatives and thus does not contribute
to the boundary integral. So our formula for the pressure
change remains the same in the presence of gravity. To be
sure, the nozzle evolution would diﬀer because the con-
tact angle and w⊥ will be aﬀected by gravity. Moreover,
if the nozzle is too large relative to the capillary length,
then gravity destabilizes all solutions: it is not possible
to suspend a water drop from a meter wide faucet.
It
would be interesting to examine the case of the interme-
diate sized nozzle, small enough to have stable solutions,
yet large enough to be aﬀected by gravity.

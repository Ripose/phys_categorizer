(Dated: February 20, 2014)

We have studied the fully nonlinear behavior of diﬀusive pre-mixed ﬂames in a gravitationally
stratiﬁed medium, subject to the Boussinesq approximation. Key results include the establishment
of criterion for when such ﬂames propagate as simple planar ﬂames; elucidation of scaling laws for
the eﬀective ﬂame speed; and a study of the stability properties of these ﬂames. The simplicity of
some of our scalings results suggests that analytical work may further advance our understandings
of buoyant ﬂames.

INTRODUCTION

In several areas of research, the feedback of a propa-
gating diﬀusive (pre-mixed combustion) ﬂame on a ﬂuid,
and the consequent eﬀects of the ﬂame itself, is of consid-
erable interest. In the astrophysical context, for exam-
ple, the possible speedup of nuclear reaction fronts of this
type in the interior of white dwarf stars is thought to be
one possible way that such stars undergo thermonuclear
disruption, e.g., a Type Ia supernova (cf. [1], [2], [3], [4],
[5], [6]). Much of the literature on this subject has fo-
cused on the speedup of such ﬂames for prescribed ﬂows,
and substantial advances have been made in this regard
recently [7]; this is the “kinematic” problem, in which one
seeks to establish rigorous limits on ﬂame speedup in the
case in which there is no feedback onto the ﬂow. The aim
of this paper is to study the simplest case of feedback,
namely that which occurs when a ﬂame propagates ver-
tically, against the direction of gravity. As described ex-
tensively by the previously cited literature, it is generally
believed that under such circumstances, the ﬂame front
is likely to become distorted by the action of Rayleigh-
Taylor instability, and thus achieves speedup; these cal-
culations have been largely illustrative, and based upon
simulations using fully-compressible ﬂuid dynamics (e.g.,
[8]) and fairly realistic nuclear reaction networks.
In-
stead, we focus here on a much simpler problem; we
study such ﬂames in the Boussinesq limit (leading to a
far simpler computational problem) and for highly sim-
pliﬁed reaction terms (avoiding the complexities of real-
istic nuclear reaction networks). In this way, we are able
to isolate the various eﬀects which lead to ﬂame speedup,
which is particularly important if one is to connect such
simulations to the extant analytical work on this subject
(e.g., [9], [10], [7]). Indeed, an important motivation for
this work is to elucidate simple scaling laws — if they
exist — in order to suggest further analytical studies.

Our paper is structured as follows: In the next sec-

study, establish the equations to be solved, and describe
the method of solution. In

II. THE PROBLEM

The eﬀect of gravity on the temperature distribution
in a reacting incompressible ﬂuid with thermal diﬀusivity
κ, viscosity η, and density ρ can be described by the set
of Navier-Stokes and advection-diﬀusion-reaction equa-
tions,

where v is the ﬂuid velocity and, without loss of gener-
ality, the temperature T has been normalized to satisfy
1. The thermal diﬀusivity and viscosity are as-
0
sumed to be temperature-independent, and density vari-
ations are assumed to be small enough to be described
by the Boussinesq model, e.g., ρ(T ) = ρ◦ + (∆ρ/ρ◦)T .

We consider a reaction term of “KPP” type, of the

form

R(T ) = αT (1

where α is the (laminar) reaction rate. This reaction
form has an unstable ﬁxed point at T = 0, the “un-
burned” state, and a stable one at T = 1, the “burned”
state. Thus a ﬂuid element with positive temperature will
inevitably evolve to the burned state in a characteristic
time of order 1/α. As is well-known from the combus-
tion literature, the temperature equation from the sys-
tem above admits — for a stationary ﬂuid, and in the
absence of gravity — one-dimensional solutions in the
form of burning fronts propagating with laminar burning
speed s◦, and with characteristic ﬂame thickness δ,

s◦ = √ακ ,

α/κ .

It is convenient to adopt the front thickness δ and the

In addition, the system is characterized by a number of
length scales specifying the initial state, which are in our
case the dimensionless amplitude A and the dimension-
less wavelength L of the initial ﬂame front perturbation,
f (x) = a cos(2πx/l),

A = a/δ ,

L = l/δ .

(5)

The vertical size of the computational domain was kept
large so as to avoid eﬀects due to the upper and lower
walls of the computational box;
in all cases, we have
checked to make sure that such eﬀects are not present.
For this reason, the box height does not enter as a prob-
lem parameter. The initial velocities are set to zero, and
most computations were carried out for Pr = 1. A typical
initial state of our ﬂame calculation is shown in Fig. 1.

Because we focus on the two-dimensional problem, it
is convenient to re-write Eqns. (1) in the stream function
and vorticity formulation in dimensionless form,

system (Eqns. 6), numerically. The solution is advanced
in time as follows: a third order Adams-Bashforth inte-
gration in time advances ω and T , where spatial deriva-
tives of ω and T are approximated by fourth-order (ex-
plicit) ﬁnite diﬀerences. The subsequent elliptic equation
for ψ is then solved by the bi-conjugate gradient method
with stabilization, using the AZTEC library [11]. Finally
we take derivatives of ψ to ﬁnd v. The grid size is chosen
so as to accurately represent the shear across the react-
ing region: typically we use 12 zones across the ﬂame
interface for thin fronts, and at least 32 zones per period
for thick fronts. The computational domain typically ex-
tends a considerable distance upstream and downstream
from the burning front, so that end boundary eﬀects are
negligible.

III. RESULTS

In this section, we discuss the results of our calcula-
tions, focusing successively on the bulk burning rate, the
evolution of the burning traveling front, and the ultimate
transition to a traveling (burning) wave. Our central in-
terest is in disentangling the dependence of the ﬂame
behavior on the key control parameters of the problem.

A. Traveling wave ﬂame

For a wide range of parameters, we were able to con-
struct a suﬃciently large computational domain that we
could observe travelling waves of the temperature dis-
tribution, propagating with constant speed. Depending
on simulation parameters, the initial perturbation either
damps (e.g., the ﬂame front ﬂattens) or forms a curved
front. The ﬂat front moves in the motion-free (in the
Boussinesq limit) ﬂuid, has laminar front structure, and
propagates with the laminar front speed.

The typical curved front is shown on Fig. 2; it has the
wavelength of the initial perturbation and is character-
ized by narrow dips (lower apexes), where the cold ﬂuid
falls into the hot region, and by wide tips (upper apexes),
where buoyant hot ﬂuid rises into the cold ﬂuid. In addi-
tion to the wavelength L, two vertical length scales enter
this problem: these are associated with the spatial tem-
perature variation (hT ) and the spatial velocity variation
(hV ) of the ﬂame. The speed of the curved front is always
higher than the laminar ﬂame speed, because of the in-
crease in the ﬂame front area and transport. Finally, we
noticed that the streamlines in Fig. 2 indicate that the
ﬂow underlying the propagating ﬂame is characterized by
rolls propagating upward.

One of our primary interests is to quantify the eﬀects of
variations in wavelength and gravity on the ﬂame speed.

speed.

Our ﬁrst important result (shown in Fig. 3) is that the
ﬂame speed increases with wavelength L and with the
gravitational acceleration G, and is independent of the
initial perturbation amplitude A. More speciﬁcally, the
ﬂame becomes planar and moves at the laminar speed
(s = s◦) if G is smaller than some critical value Gcr; if G
lies above this critical value, the ﬂame speed can be ﬁt
by the expression,

rameter, G1, was found to be a function of the pertur-
bation wavelength (Fig. 4), G1 = 8(2π/L)1.72. For a
relatively wide range of parameters, Eq. (8) describes ex-
perimental data well, but must be applied with caution
near the cusp at G = G1 shown in Fig. 3. Roughly
speaking, this cusp can be interpreted as the transition
between the planar and curved ﬂame regimes, G1
Gcr;
closer investigation of the transition region shows that
Gcr < G1, and that the ﬁt (Eq. 8) underestimates the
ﬂame speed in this transition region (Fig. 5).

The behavior near the transition is discussed in the
theoretical work carried out by Berestycki, Kamin &
Sivashinsky [10]; they estimate the ﬂame speed just above
critical gravity as follows,

Close to the critical gravity value Gcr, we ﬁnd that it
takes a very long time for the system to reach the trav-
eling wave solution; this is consistent with the prediction
by Berestycki et al. that the settling times to the steady
solution would be long in this transition regime. For this
reason, it is very diﬃcult to obtain reliable results regard-
ing the ﬂame speed in this transition regime. Even de-
tecting the critical point takes signiﬁcant computational

In the limit of large wavelengths (L
1), the transition
occurs at small values of gravity, and the ﬂame speed is
determined by a single parameter, the product LG. If, in
addition, the product LG is large, the ﬂame speed scales
0.22√LG. This result is in the good agreement
as s/s◦
with the rising bubble model [12] which, in the Boussi-
0.23√LG for a
nesq limit, predicts s/s◦ =
2-D open bubble [13]. We further observe an interesting
fact that in the large wavelength limit, the hT /l ratio
obeys the same scaling (Fig. 5).

We note that the ﬂame structure shares features of
ﬂame propagation from both shear and cellular ﬂow. For
instance, the temperature distribution closely resembles
that of ﬂame distorted by a shear ﬂow, while the veloc-
ity distribution resembles that of the velocity inside an
inﬁnitely tall cell. We have tried to determine whether
the ﬂame speed relates to the maximum velocity of the
ﬂow; in Fig. 6, we plot the ﬂame speed as a function of
the maximum ﬂow speed, demonstrating that the rela-
tionship is not as simple as in the cases of stirred shear

The thin front limit is particularly important for de-
veloping models of ﬂame behavior. For many applica-

(by direct simulation) is prohibitively expensive, and un-
derstanding ﬂame propagation in the limit in which the
ﬂame front becomes indeﬁnitely thin (when compared to
other length scales of the application) is critical for de-
signing ﬂame models. Of course, this same limit is of
intrinsic mathematical interest.

Particularly important is the dependence of the ﬂame
speed on the wavelength of the front perturbation in
the thin front limit. We have already pointed out that
instabilities with larger wavelengths have higher travel-
ing wave speeds, so that eventually the instability with
largest wavelength allowed by the system dominates. (In
our non-dimensionalization, this is the instability with
highest ratio of wavelength to laminar front width).

In this context,

it is convenient to switch from
our “laminar ﬂame units” to the so-called “G-equation
units”. The G-equation is a model for reactive systems

so that the front propagates normal to itself at the lam-
inar ﬂame speed s◦. The Boussinesq ﬂuid model, com-
bined with the G-equation ﬂame model, has the following
physical parameters: (1) ﬂow length scale l, (2) laminar
ﬂame speed s◦, (3) gravity g, and (4) ﬂuid viscosity ν.
Choosing l and l/s◦ as the length and time units, the
governing non-dimensional parameters are ˜g = gl/s2
◦ and
˜ν = ν/ls◦; the corresponding parameters in the lam-
inar ﬂame unit system are ˜g = LG and ˜ν = Pr/L.
Note that in the limit L
while keeping Pr = 1,
the Navier-Stokes equation becomes the Euler equation
and ˜ν
0, leaving only one parameter in the system,
→
˜g = (∆ρ/ρ◦)gl/s2

→ ∞

◦ = LG.

In our simulations Pr = 1, so it is not surprising that
for large L, almost all aspects of the system are well
characterized by the LG product alone. For example, the
formula for the bulk burning rate, s/s◦ = √1 + k1LG for
G > G1 well describes our experimental results. Next,
consider the traveling wave solutions shown in Fig. 2;
these two systems have the same LG product, with L =
32 and L = 128, and move at the speed s/s◦ = 1.34
and s/s◦ = 1.51 respectively. The wavelength here is
comparable with the laminar front thickness (indicated
by the two limiting isotherms T = 0.1 and T = 0.9).
Still, the front shape as well as ﬂame speed and ﬂuid
velocities are very similar.

One can see similarity more clearly in Fig. 7 (mid-
dle plot), which compares systems with L = 128 and
L = 256. The agreement between bulk burning rates
is very good (s/s◦ = 1.51 and s/s◦ = 1.57). The
match between the two integral measures hT is weaker
(hT /l = 0.83 and hT /l = 0.75), suggesting that the sys-
tems in consideration are still far from the inﬁnitely thin
front limit, but this is apparent from the distance be-
tween limiting isotherms. We have also compared the
temperature and velocity proﬁles at the upper and lower
apexes of the ﬂame (Fig. 7, the top and the bottom pan-
els). The velocity is — as expected — essentially zero
well ahead of the temperature front, but signiﬁcant mo-
tion extends far behind it; the absolute maximum veloc-
ity is located in the vicinity of the lower apex and is re-
lated to the bulk burning rate (Fig. 6). By examing the

FIG. 7: Traveling wave solution for two systems with LG =
32, one with L = 128 (dashed lines), and the second with
L = 256 (solid lines). The isotherms T = 0.1 and T = 0.9
are shown on the middle panel. The top panel shows the
temperature proﬁles and vertical velocities (along g) at x =
0.5 (upper ﬂame front apex); the bottom panel plot shows the
same things at x = 0 (lower ﬂame front apex).

detailed velocity proﬁles we ﬁnd that velocities at the
ﬂame front also obey the LG product scaling, and, to-
gether with the temperature distribution, determine the
bulk burning rate. However, the velocities well behind
the front can be quite diﬀerent for two systems with the
same LG product (cf. Fig. 2).

Finally, consider the temperature during the instabil-
ity growth phase, shown for three diﬀerent cases (with
LG = 512) in Fig. 8. Although the wavelength to lam-
inar front thickness ratio aﬀects small scale features, we
again clearly see the similarity scaling connecting these
solutions.

As we have shown above, the dependence on a sin-
gle parameter, namely the LG product, in the inﬁnitely
thin front limit follows from dimensional analysis; and
for reasonably thin fronts, we were able to conﬁrm the
LG product scaling. At the same time, we have noticed
that the length of the velocity variation, hV , does not
scale with LG
˜g. It is reasonable to assume that the
hV is controlled by the other parameter, non-dimensional
viscosity ˜ν = Pr/L, which is essentially zero in the thin
ﬂame limit. One can understand this as follows.

≡

From Eq. (6a), we can see that vorticity is generated in
the regions with signiﬁcant temperature gradients, e.g.,
on the scale hT , and is advected by the ﬂow on spa-

ever, in steady state, we know that vorticity generation
and destruction must balance exactly. Since the vortic-
2ω, which
ity destruction depends on diﬀusion term Pr
decreases as L increases, balance can only be achieved if
the length of the vorticity diﬀusion region (i.e. the sep-
aratrix separating adjacent rolls) lengthens. Thus, we
expect hV to scale inversely with ˜ν = Pr/L. Indeed, we

C. Comparison with linear stability analyses

A thorough analysis of the linear behavior of our sys-
[15]; in this sub-

tem was presented by Zeldovich et al.
section, we compare our results with theirs.

The simplest case studied is the so-called Landau-
Darrieus instability, in which the ﬂame is considered as a
simple gas dynamic discontinuity. The ﬂuid on either side
of the discontinuity is assumed to obey the Euler equa-
tion; the ﬂuid is assumed to be incompressible; there
is no temperature evolution equation; and the front is
assumed to move normal to itself with a given laminar
speed. The important parameter is the degree of thermal
expansion, θ
ρfuel/ρash, across the ﬂame front. The
resulting instability growth rate is proportional to the
product of the laminar ﬂame speed and the wavenumber
of the front perturbation, with a coeﬃcient of proportion-
ality depending on θ. For θ = 1, which corresponds to
the Boussinesq limit, the growth rate is identically equal
to zero.

≡

The Landau-Darrieus model is however not valid for
wavelengths short compared to the ﬂame thickness, for
which it predicts the largest growth rate; this deﬁciency
was resolved by Markstein [16], who introduced an empir-

FIG. 8: The isotherm T = 0.5 during the instability growth

initial amplitude is a/l = 1/8, and snapshots are taken at

tial scales of order hV . Thus, positive vorticity is gener-
ated in the domains nl < x < (n + 1/2)l, while negative
vorticity is generated in the domains (n + 1/2)l < x <
(n + 1)l; however, the total (signed) vorticity in the do-
main is conserved. Diﬀusion of vorticity occurs predom-
inantly across the boundaries x = nl/2. More directly,
it is straightforward to integrate the vorticity equation
(Eq. 6a) over the area nl < x < (n + 1/2)l to obtain the
vorticity balance,

Here ˙Ω is the total vorticity generated in the roll nl <

In Fig. 9 we have plotted the non-dimensional vortic-
ity generation, averaged in the area element (l/2, ∆y),
˜fω = ˜g(l/s2
◦)(∆ ˙Ω/∆y), and corresponding ﬂuxes across
the roll boundaries. Note that only diﬀusion can lead
to vorticity transport across roll boundaries because the
transverse ﬂow vanishes identically at the separatrices.

In other words, in the thin ﬂame limit, vorticity gener-
ation depends on LG product, but not the viscosity; how-

ical “curvature correction” for the ﬂame speed within the
context of the Landau-Darrieus model. One consequence
of this correction is that the instability is suppressed for
wavelengths shorter than a speciﬁc critical cutoﬀ wave-
length, while for wavelengths much larger than this cutoﬀ
lengthscale the growth rate approaches zero as 1/L, just
as in the Landau-Darrieus model.

Gravity can be introduced in this type of model in
a very similar way, as shown by Zeldovich et al.
[15].
Rewriting their result in our notation, and taking into
account θ = 1 and Le = 1 (which leads to the Markstein
curvature correction constant being set equal to unity),
we can reduce their ﬁnal result to the following expression
for the growth rate,

introduced by Pelce & Clavin [17], avoids the empiri-

To compare our calculations with this result, we have
computed the growth rate for a single wavelength for
a system with L = 512 and L = 1024 (see Fig. 10).

FIG. 11: Growth exponent for a single mode measured at the
maximum for A = 4 and L = 1024. The solid line corresponds
to the linear stability analysis prediction, Eq.(13).

The growth rates predicted by Eq.(13) are shown as hor-
izontal dotted lines for each LG product. An ideal sys-
tem in the linear regime would have a constant growth
rate;
in our simulations we observe essentially time-
independent growth rate only after some transitional pe-
riod, t < 0.1 l/s◦, and before the ﬂame stabilization time,
which depends on parameters. The transitional period at
the beginning of our simulations can be explained by arti-
ﬁcial initial conditions, e.g. zero velocity and prescribed
temperature proﬁle across interface. The decrease in the
growth rate at later times is related to the stabilization
of the ﬂame front. Naturally, the faster-growing insta-
bilities with higher LG product and the systems start-
ing with larger initial amplitudes reach the steady-state
faster. In addition, we observe the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite
ﬂame thickness — plots with L = 1024 approaches closer
to the inﬁnitely thin limit than plots with L = 512. But
in spite of the ﬁnite ﬂame thickness and non-zero viscos-
ity, one can clearly see the similarity scaling on LG and
good agreement with theory (Fig. 11).

In order to obtain the stability condition, we set γ = 0

in the expressions (11) and (12), and obtain

which can be plugged in from Eq. (13). Comparing the
result with the ﬁt derived from the experimental data

Finally, we note that a quick comparison of the
asymptotic behavior of the Rayleigh-Taylor and Landau-
L−1/2 for
Darrieus instabilities for large L gives γ
L−1 for Landau-Darrieus. In
Rayleigh-Taylor and γ
our Boussinesq case, the same asymptotic limit gives
L−1/2: the instability behaves like the Rayleigh-
γ
Taylor instability at long wavelengths, e.g., longer wave-
lengths grow more slowly, but saturate later and reach
larger front speeds.

D. Transition to the travelling wave

The transition time during which the temperature
front is formed is of the order of the laminar burning
time across the period, 0.5 l/s◦, but a much longer time
is needed to stabilize the velocity pattern behind this
front. Fig. 8 illustrates the process for a moderate value
of L; in the Fig. 13 we show snapshots for a ﬂame with an
L value closer to the just discussed Rayleigh-Taylor limit.
Indeed, Fig. 13 shows morphology strongly reminiscent of

8

the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, namely upward-moving
“bubbles” and downward moving “spikes”.

The images shown in Fig. 14 illustrate the propaga-
tion of a ﬂame with eight wavelengths (with L = 16)
within the computational box with reﬂecting boundary
conditions. The traveling wave solution is formed by
30 δ/s◦ and remains unchanged until time
time t
t
100 δ/s◦. Now, the symmetry of the initial con-
ditions requires zero horizontal velocity at x = nl/2,
n = 0, 1, 2, ...; this symmetry constraint is clearly bro-
ken for t & 100δ/s◦, and the traveling wave solution be-
comes violently unstable. The cause of this symmetry
breaking is apparently accumulated numerical errors in
the calculation, but we would expect any natural system
to exhibit similar behavior as total absence of noise is
practically impossible.

An important aspect of this instability is that it ex-
hibit a strong inverse cascade. Since perturbations with
larger wavelengths move faster, the system will eventu-
ally pick the speed corresponding to the largest possible
wavelength. In our simulations the largest wavelength is
imposed by the size of the computational domain; in the
example shown, the resulting traveling wave will have a
wavelength L = 256 (twice the box size) of course an
artifact of the simulation. In a natural system we would
expect the upper bound to be set by extrinsic spatial
scales of the physical system.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have studied the fully nonlinear be-
havior of diﬀusive pre-mixed ﬂames in a gravitationally
stratiﬁed medium, subject to the Boussinesq approxima-
tion. Our aim was both to compare our results for a
viscid system with analytical (and empirical) results in
the existent literature, and to better understand the phe-
nomenology of fully nonlinear ﬂames subject to gravity.
The essence of our results is that the numerics by and
large conﬁrm the Markstein and Pelce & Clavin mod-
els, and extend their results to ﬁnite viscosity. We have
shown explicitly that there is an extended regime for
ﬂames with ﬁnite ﬂame front thickness for which the
scaling on the LG product applies (as it known to do
in the thin ﬂame front limit). We have also examined
the details of the ﬂame front structure, and are able to
give physically-motivated explanations for the observed
scalings, for example, of the ﬂow length scale behind the
ﬂame front on Prandtl number.

We have also observed a potentially new instability,
which arises when noise breaks the symmetry constraint
of the initial front perturbation. Our study suggest that
this instability diﬀers signiﬁcantly from ﬁnger merging
behavior of the non-linear Rayleigh-Taylor instability, in
which the ﬁnger merging process resembles a continuous
period-doubling phenomenon (e.g. adjacent ﬁngers at
any given generation merge in pairs). In contrast, the in-
stability we observe seems to involve seeding, and strong
growth, of modes with wavelengths much larger than the
wavelength of the dominant front disturbance. We are

∼

≈

currently investigating this instability in greater detail.
Finally, it is of some interest to consider the implica-
tion of our results for astrophysical nuclear ﬂames, as
arise in the context of white dwarf explosion. Using the
results of Timmes & Woosly [18], we ﬁnd that we would
be far into the thin ﬂame limit, with a density jump
at the ﬂame front ∆ρ
0.1ρ; hence our Boussinesq re-
sults are rather marginal in their applicability. Never-
theless, one can ask what the expected ﬂame speed up
would be in this limit; using our results we ﬁnd that

dent of the laminar ﬂame speed, s = 0.23 (lg∆ρ/ρ)1/2

100 km/s, which could be also derived the using rising
bubble model [13]. Evidently, the ﬂame speedup in this
limit is very modest. Whether compressibility has much
eﬀect on this conclusion remains to be established and is
now under active investigation.

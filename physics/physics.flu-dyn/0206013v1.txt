New aspects of turbulence are uncovered if one considers ﬂow motion from the perspective of a ﬂuid
particle (known as the Lagrangian approach) rather than in terms of a velocity ﬁeld (the Eulerian
viewpoint). Using a new experimental technique, based on the scattering of ultrasounds, we have
obtained a direct measurement of particle velocities, resolved at all scales, in a fully turbulent ﬂow. It
enables us to approach intermittency in turbulence from a dynamical point of view and to analyze the
Lagrangian velocity ﬂuctuations in the framework of random walks. We ﬁnd experimentally that the
elementary steps in the walk have random uncorrelated directions but a magnitude that is extremely
long-range correlated in time. Theoretically, we study a Langevin equation that incorporates these
features and we show that the resulting dynamics accounts for the observed one- and two-point
statistical properties of the Lagrangian velocity ﬂuctuations. Our approach connects the intermittent
statistical nature of turbulence to the dynamics of the ﬂow.

Traditional experimental studies of velocity ﬂuctua-
tions in turbulence rely on velocimetry measurement at
a ﬁxed point in space. A local velocity probe yields time
traces of the velocity ﬂuctuations which are then related
to spatial velocity proﬁles using the Taylor hypothesis [1].
In this case, the ﬂow is analyzed in terms of the Eu-
lerian velocity ﬁeld u(x, t). One of the most peculiar
feature of homogeneous three-dimensional turbulence is
its intermittency, well established in the Eulerian frame-
work [2]. The statistical properties of the ﬂow depend on
the length scale at which it is analyzed. For instance, the
functional form of the probability of measuring an Eule-
rian velocity increment ∆su(x) = u(x + s) − u(x) varies
with the magnitude of the length scale s. Many studies
devoted to the understanding of this feature have been
developed along the lines of Kolmogorov and Obhukov
1962 pioneering ideas [3]. In this case, intermittency is
analyzed in terms of the anomalous scaling of the mo-
ments of the velocity increments in space. It is attributed
to the inhomogeneity in space of the turbulent activity
and often analyzed in terms of ad-hoc multiplicative cas-
cade models [2]. Although very successful at describing
the data, these models have failed to connect intermit-
tency with the dynamical equations that govern the mo-
tion of the ﬂuid. Here, we adopt a Lagrangian point of

view.
port problems in turbulence [4]. In addition it has been
shown in the passive scalar problem that intermittency
is strongly connected to the particular properties of La-
grangian trajectories [5, 6]. In the Lagrangian approach,
the ﬂow is parameterized by v(x0, t), the velocity of a
ﬂuid particle initially at position x0. Experimentally, we
follow the motion of a single tracer particle and we con-
sider the increments in time of its velocity ﬂuctuations:
∆τ v(t) = v(t+τ )−v(t). Our ﬁrst observations [7] have es-
tablished and described intermittency in this Lagrangian

pose here a new point of view. Since our measurements
give access to the individual motion of ﬂuid particles,
we study intermittency from a dynamical point of view.
We show that the anomalous scaling in the Lagrangian
velocity increments traces back to the existence of long-
time correlations in the particle accelerations, i.e.
the
hydrodynamic forces that drive the particle motion.

In order to study the motion of Lagrangian tracers,
we need to resolve their velocity ﬂuctuations across a
wide range of scales. To this end, we use a conﬁned ﬂow
with no mean advection, so that ﬂuid particles remain
for long times inside a given measurement volume. The
tracking of small tracer particles is achieved using a new
acoustic technique based on the principle of a “continu-
ous Doppler sonar”. The ﬂow volume is continuously in-
soniﬁed with a monochromatic ultrasound which is then
scattered by the tracer particle [7]. This scattered sound
is detected by two transducer arrays which yield a mea-
surement of both the particle position, by direct triangu-
lation, and of its velocity, from the Doppler shift. Indeed,
for an incoming sound with frequency f0 , the scattered
sound at the receiver has frequency f (t) = f0 + k.v(t)
, where v(t) is the velocity of the tracer particle and k
is the scattering wave vector. This frequency modula-
tion in the acoustic signal is extracted numerically, us-
ing a high-resolution parametric method [8]. Figure 1(a)
shows the experimental set-up and an example of a par-
ticle trajectory; Figure 1(b) gives an example of the time
variation of one component of its velocity. A water ﬂow
of the von Karman swirling type [7, 9] is generated in-
side a cylinder by counter-rotation at Ω = 7 Hz of two
discs with radius R = 9.5 cm, ﬁtted with eight blades
of height 0.5 cm and set 18 cm apart. The ﬂow power
consumption is ǫ = 25 W/kg, with velocity ﬂuctuations
urms = 0.98 m/s. The characteristic size of the velocity
gradients is ℓ = (15u2
rms/ǫ)1/2 = 880 µm, larger than
the diameter (250 µm) of the neutrally buoyant tracer

particle (density of 1.06). The turbulent Reynolds num-
ber of the ﬂow is Rℓ = urmsℓ/ν = 740. The large scale
ﬂow is axisymmetric and the ﬂuctuations in its center ap-
proximate well the conditions of local homogeneous and
isotropic turbulence. The ﬂow is insoniﬁed at 2.5 MHz,
with the transducers located at the ﬂow wall. The re-
ceiver arrays are placed at 45 degrees on each side of the
emission direction. The measurement region is the inter-
section of the emission and detection cones. The particles
act as Lagrangian tracers for times longer than 1 ms (be-
low which inertia cuts oﬀ their response), up to times as
long as they will stay conﬁned insided the measurement
volume, i.e. between one and ten TL, the Lagrangian in-
tegral time scale (computed from the Lagrangian velocity
autocorrelation function). 4000 such events are analyzed,
for a total of 1.9 × 106 data points sampled at 6.5 kHz.

an example of a particle 3D trajectory, 206 ms (= 9.2 TL);
(b) corresponding velocity variation (one component shown).

The probability density functions (PDFs) of the La-
grangian time increments Πτ (∆v), are shown in Fig.2.
They are Gaussian at integral scale (τ > TL) and vary
continuously towards the development of stretched ex-
ponential tails as the time increments decrease towards
the dissipative time scale [7, 10]. The outer curve in
Fig.2 is the PDFs of Lagrangian acceleration measured
by LaPorta et al. [9] in the same ﬂow geometry and at
a comparable turbulent Reynolds number. This evolu-
tion of the PDFs Πτ (∆v) leads to an anomalous scal-
ing of the velocity structure functions h|∆τ v|qi ∼ τ ζ(q),
with ζ(q) a non-linear function of q. The intermit-
tency spectrum is usually measured experimentally us-
ing the ESS ansatz [11], i.e. via the relative scaling
h|∆τ v|qi ∼ h|∆τ v|2iξ(q), where ξ(q) = ζ(q)/ζ(2). In Kol-
mogorov K41 phenomenology [2], the Lagrangian second
order structure function is assumed to scale linearly with
the time increment τ so that ζ(2) is considered as being

experimentally [7]. Given the statistics available in our
experiments, one is limited to moments up to order 6.
We observe that ξ(q) is well represented by a quadratic

numerical simulations [12]. This is expected [13], and
mainly comes from the facts that time increments are
measured here and that the reference structure function
is the second order one.

Intermittency is thus observed and quantiﬁed in both
Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks.
In contrast to
traditionnal Eulerian studies where intermittency is de-
scribed in terms of multiplicative processes, we look here
for a dynamical origin. We consider the statistics of the
ﬂuid particles ﬂuctuating velocity in analogy with a ran-
dom walk. We write a velocity increment over a time lag
τ as the sum of contributions over small times τ1:

∆τ v(t) = v(t + τ ) − v(t) =

∆τ1 v(t + nτ1) .

If the incremental “steps” of duration τ1 were inde-
pendent (and identically distributed), the PDF Πτ (∆v)
would readily be obtained as a convolution of the ele-
mentary distribution at scale τ1, Πτ1(∆v) — plus an
eventual convolution kernel to account for stationarity
at large scales. Such a regular convolution process corre-
sponds to the Kolmogorov K41 picture of turbulence [2];
the particle velocity ﬂuctuations are Brownian and the

scaling is monofractal. A ﬁrst important result of our
analysis is to show that the elementary steps are not inde-
pendent. The auto-correlation of the signed increments,
∆τ1v(t), decays very rapidly (cf. Fig.3): the correlation
coeﬃcient drops under 0.05 for time separations larger
than 2τ1. However, if one considers the amplitude of the
“steps” (|∆τ1 v(t)|), one ﬁnds that the auto-correlation
decays very slowly and only vanishes at the largest time
scales of the turbulent motion. Recast in terms of the
random walk, our results show that the amplitudes of the
“steps” are long-range correlated in time although their
directions are not. As this point is fundamental for our
approach, we have veriﬁed it using a Lagrangian tracking
algorithm in a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the
Navier-Stokes equations, using a pseudo-spectral solver,
at Rℓ = 75, and for the same ratio τ1/TL — see inset of
Fig.3. The results are in remarkable agreement with our
measurements. All increments are correlated for ∆t < τ1,
the time over which they are computed. Above τ1, the
correlation of the signed increments rapidly drops while
the correlation coeﬃcient of their absolute values decays
very slowly, to vanish only for ∆t > 3 TL. This behavior
is observed for τ1 chosen from the smallest resolved time
scales to inertial range values. These observations also
persist in the limit of very small time increments, and
thus presumably for the acceleration of the ﬂuid particle
and thus for the forces acting on it.

cient χ(f, g)(∆t) = h(f (t + ∆t) − hf i)(g(t) − hgi)i/σf σg.
Two velocity components are considered: the squares and
diamonds mark the χ(∆τ1 vx, ∆τ1 vx) and χ(∆τ1 vy, ∆τ1 vy)
auto-correlation functions while the circles mark the cross-
correlation χ(∆τ1 vx, ∆τ1 vy); curves with ﬁlled symbols are
computed using the absolute value of the increments while
the curves with open symbols are computed using the full
signed increments. The main curve corresponds to the ex-
periment at Rℓ = 740, with τ1 = 0.03 TL. The inset shows
similar results for a Direct Numerical Simulation at Rℓ = 75.

Theoretically, one would like to understand this behav-
ior from the hydrodynamic forces in the Navier-Stokes
equations. Such a direct analytical treatment is out
of reach at present. We propose, as a natural ﬁrst

3

step, to study a surrogate dynamical equation of the
Langevin type. In this procedure, one considers a one-
dimensional variable, W (t), representing the particle ve-
locity, driven by a stochastic force. If this force is chosen
as a white noise then W (t) has the dynamics of Brow-
nian motion:
its statistics is monofractal with a simi-
larity exponent equal to 1/2 — the increments scale as
h|W (t + τ ) − W (t)|pit ∼ τ p/2, corresponding to the non-
intermittent Kolmogorov 1941 picture.
In order to ac-
count for intermittency, one needs to ascribe other prop-
erties to the stochastic force. Guided by our experimen-
tal results, we build a stochastic force having a random
direction and a long-range correlation in its magnitude.
Speciﬁcally, its direction is modeled by a Gaussian vari-
able G(t), chosen white in time, with zero mean and unit
variance. The amplitude of the force, A(t), being a posi-
tive variable, is written A(t) = exp[ω(t)] where the mag-
nitude ω(t) is a stochastic process that satisﬁes:

hω(t)ω(t + ∆t)it = −λ2 ln(∆t/TL) for ∆t < TL,

(3)

and 0 otherwise — λ2 being an adjustable parame-
ter. When discretized, this dynamics corresponds to a
one-dimensional Multifractal Random Walk (MRW) [14].
Analytical calculations show that the resulting dynam-
ical variable W (t) has multi-scaling properties. The
moments have scaling laws, h|∆τ W |qi ∼ τ ζ(q), with
ζ(q) = (1/2 + λ2)q − λ2q2/2, so that λ2 in equation (3)
is the intermittency parameter of the model [14]. It is a
fundamental point that the same parameter λ2 governs
both the evolution of the PDFs of the increments (one-
time statistics) and the time correlation of the process
(two-time statistics).

We show that this model captures the essential features
of the Lagrangian data. First, in order to test the rele-
vance of equation 3, we have computed, from the experi-
mental and numerical data, the auto-correlation function
of the logarithm of the amplitude of inﬁnitesimal La-
grangian velocity increments: χ(log |∆τ1vx|, log |∆τ1 vx|).
Figure 4(a) conﬁrms that the logarithmic decrease build
in the MRW model (equation 3) is observed both in
the experimental and numerical data; it yields the es-
timate λ2 = 0.115 ± 0.01. Second, we check the rele-
vance of the model for the description of the one-time
statistics of the Lagrangian increments ∆τ v. We note —
Fig.2, upper curve— that the choice λ2 = 0.115 yields
a PDF for the stochastic force that is in remarquable
agreement with experimental measurements of ﬂuid par-
ticle accelerations [9]. The agreement at larger time
scales is evidenced on the behavior of the ﬁrst two cu-
mulants. Cumulants are computed with more reliabil-
ity that the moments and are related to them through
h|∆τ v|qi = hexp (q ln |∆τ v|)i = exp (Pn Cn(τ )qn/q!). In
the MRW model, one can analytically derive [14]:

C1(τ ) = (1 + λ2) ln(τ ), C2(τ ) = −λ2 ln(τ ),

dominate the motion of a ﬂuid particle. It can be un-
derstood if, along its trajectory, the particle encounters
very intense small-scale structures (vortices and stagna-
tion points) over a more quiet background. Intermittency
is then due to the nature and distribution of these small
scale structures. Indeed, the analogy with a random walk
suggests that the statistics at all scales can be recov-
ered if one ascribes two properties to the small scales: 1)
the probability density function of ﬂuid particle acceler-
ations and 2) the functional form of their time correla-
tions. In the Lagrangian framework, these features are
directly linked to the Navier-Stokes equations that gov-
ern the elementary changes in the velocity (momentum)
of the ﬂuid particles. It thus gives a possibility to derive
intermittency from the constitutive physical equations.
Although this may be quite a theoretical challenge, di-
rect numerical simulations look promising as they allow
the study of the ﬂow dynamical ﬁelds (pressure, velocity
gradient tensor, etc.) along the trajectory of individual
ﬂuid particles.

computed from the experimental and numerical data are
shown in Figures 4(b) and 4(c) and compared to MRW
model predictions when the intermittency parameter is
set to the value λ2 = 0.115 that is derived from the cor-
relations in the dynamics. One observes that in each
case the agreement is excellent; the slope of the variation
∂C1,2(τ )/∂ ln τ in the inertial range is correctly given by
equation (4). The same intermittency parameter thus
governs the anomalous scaling of the Lagrangian velocity
increments and their long-time dynamical correlations.

We therefore believe that long-time correlations in the
Lagrangian dynamics are a key feature for the under-
standing of intermittency, which leads to a new dynam-
ical picture of turbulence. Long-time correlations and
the occurrence of very large ﬂuctuations at small-scales

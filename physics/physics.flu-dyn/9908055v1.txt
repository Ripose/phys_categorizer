A system of three point vorties in an unbounded plane has a spe-

ial family of self-similarly ontrating or expanding solutions: during

the motion, vortex triangle remains similar to the original one, while its

area dereases (grows) at a onstant rate. A ontrating on(cid:28)guration

brings three vorties to a single point in a (cid:28)nite time; this phenomenon

is known as vortex ollapse and is of prinipal importane for many-

vortex systems. The self-similar motion (ontrating or expanding) is

two speial ollapse onditions. Dynamis of lose-to-ollapse vortex

on(cid:28)gurations depends on the way the ollapse onditions are violated.

We show, that when two of the vorties are idential, it is possible to

redue a three-vortex system to a problem of motion of a partile in

an e(cid:27)etive potential, de(cid:28)ned by initial onditions. Using the e(cid:27)etive

potential representation, a detailed quantitative analysis of di(cid:27)erent

types of near-ollapse dynamis is performed. We disuss time and

length sales, emerging in the problem, and their behavior as the ini-

tial vortex triangle is approahing to an exat ollapse on(cid:28)guration.

Speial features of passive partile mixing by a near-ollapse (cid:29)ows are

illustrated numerially.

Introdution

The importane of point vortex systems in appliations is due to the domi-

nant role of oherent vortial strutures in many 2D turbulent (cid:29)ows. Exper-

imental and numerial studies performed in [1℄-[8℄ have demonstrated, that

in ases of driven or freely deaying 2D turbulene a number of onentrated

vorties develops out of an originally unstrutured (cid:29)ow. In many situations,

dynamis of this (cid:28)nite-size vorties an be reasonably well approximated by

point-vortex models [9℄-[11℄.

The number of vorties in a (cid:29)ow an be quite large, in whih ase a om-

plete dynamial desription gets intratable, but still an yield some impor-

2

tant statistial quantities [12, 13℄. On the other hand, few-vortex systems an

be investigated in muh more detail. Reent interest in this area was mainly

direted towards the study of Lagrangian haos in di(cid:27)erent settings [14℄-[19℄.

Apart from this, low-dimensional vortex dynamis is essential to understand

the evolution of many-vortex (cid:29)ows, sine it desribes their "elementary in-

terations" [20℄. Analysis of rare gas of vortex pathes, performed in [21℄

indiates, that in the limit of low vortex density (vortex oupation less than

one-two perent), strong interations our only between three vorties in a

spei(cid:28) way, similar to the three point-vortex ol lapse. These proesses may

be thought of as resonane interations in the vortex gas.

The phenomenon of (cid:28)nite-time ollapse of three point vorties into one

was studied by several authors [20, 22, 23, 24, 25℄. For the ollapse to hap-

pen ertain onditions on vortex strengths and initial positions have to be

satis(cid:28)ed exatly, so that in a real system, probability of this event is zero:

true resonanes do not our. However, atual vorties have some harater-

isti size, and when distane between them gets omparable with their size,

vorties experiene a onsiderable distortion, and may merge together, whih

means, that from a broader physial point of view, a ollapse an be thought

of as a proess whih brings vorties lose enough (up to their size) to eah

other. For three initially well-separated vorties to ollapse in the above

sense, their strength and positions may satisfy "resonane onditions" only

approximately. We refer to this kind of motion as near-ollapse dynamis.

Its importane stems from the fat, that inter-vortex distanes are hanged

3

onsiderably (by orders of magnitude) during the motion, whih brings the

system to a di(cid:27)erent length-sale, where new physial mehanisms enter into

play.

area.

The dynamis of exat ollapse is relatively simple due to a self-similarity

of vortex motion in this ase: a triangle formed by vorties (vortex triangle)

rotates and shrinks, but stays similar to the initial one. Vortex triangle area

dereases linearly with time, at a rate determined by vortex strengths and

triangle shape [20℄. A spatial re(cid:29)etion of a vortex triangle is equivalent to a

time reversal, so that a re(cid:29)etion of a ollapse on(cid:28)guration will experiene

an in(cid:28)nite self-similar expansion with the same rate of hange of triangle

In this paper we perform a detailed analysis of near-ollapse situations,

when resonane initial onditions are slightly distorted, and/or vortex strengths

are not preisely tuned. We restrit our attention to the ase when two of the

vorties are idential, for whih it is possible to map the dynamis of vortex

separation to a motion of a partile in a one dimensional potential. In setion

2 the basi equations of vortex motion, their symmetries and orresponding

(cid:28)rst integrals are spei(cid:28)ed. E(cid:27)etive Hamiltonian for a three-vortex system

with two idential vorties is introdued in setion 3; using whih di(cid:27)erent

types of near-ollapse dynamis are lassi(cid:28)ed and analyzed. In setion 4 we

disuss various routes to ollapse, i.e. the manner in whih near-ollapse mo-

tion types approah self-similarly ontrating (expanding) solutions as initial

on(cid:28)guration is taken loser to the exat resonane.

In setion 5 we give

2 Dynamial equations

Point vorties are solutions of two-dimensional physial systems desribed

by a onservation equation whih is a generalization of the vortiity Euler

equation. The dynamis of generalized vortiity Ω is given by:

∂Ω
∂t

+ [Ω, ψ] = 0 ,

(1)

where [
·

,

·

] is the usual Poisson braket, and ψ is the stream funtion; an

atual relation Ω = F (ψ) depends on a partiular physial system; in ase

of Euler equation: Ω =

2ψ . Equation (1) expresses the onservation of

−∇

generalized vortiity along the path lines of the (cid:29)ow.

Point vorties are exat solutions of Euler equation (see for example [26℄);

they also are exat solutions in a more general ase (1), when Ω =

2ψ +

−∇

ψ/l2

s where ψ , in this ontext, is related to the eletri potential (in suitable

units) in plasma, and ls is a hybrid Larmor radius, a harateristi length

whih introdues a (cid:28)nite range interation between onentrated vorties.

In this ase the usual logarithmi vortex pair interation is replaed by a

modi(cid:28)ed Bessel funtion K0 interation.

A point vortex system is de(cid:28)ned by a vortiity distribution given by a

5

superposition of Dira funtions:

Ω(x, t) =

kiδ (x − xi(t)) ,

N

Xi=1

where x is a vetor in the plane of the (cid:29)ow, ki is the irulation of i-th vortex,

N is the total number of vorties, and xi(t) is the vortex position at time

t. Using this expression for the vortiity, and solving Poisson equation, in

the Euler ase, or Helmholtz equation, in the more general ase, one obtains

a stream funtion of a point vortex system. By Helmholtz theorem [27℄,

the motion of vorties is determined by the value of the veloity (cid:28)eld at the

position of the vortex. If the veloity (cid:28)eld is written as v = ez ∧ ∇
where ez is the unit vetor perpendiular to the plane of the (cid:29)ow, and φ

ψ +

φ,

∇

takes into aount the potential (cid:29)ow, the equation of a point vortex motion

is:

ki

dxi
dt

= ez ∧

∂H
∂xi

+ ki∇

φ .

where the Hamiltonian H , in ase of an unbounded (cid:29)ow plane, is given by:

(2)

(3)

(4)

H =

1
2π

Xi>j

kikjU(

|xi − xj|

)

with the interation potential U(x) =

log(x) in the Euler ase, and U(x) =

−
K0(x) in the more general ase (when ls → ∞ the modi(cid:28)ed Bessel funtion
K0(x) tends to ln(x)). The Hamiltonian (4) is invariant under translation

and rotation, whih implies both the onservation of the two omponents of

(6)

When the distane between the vorties is smaller than the typial inter-

ation length (ls) the behavior of the two systems is similar (K0(x)

ln(x)),

∼

in the opposite ase, the energy dereases exponentially and the interations

between the vorties an be negleted. In the following, analytial ompu-

tations will be made using the logarithmi interation, whih orresponds to

the Euler (cid:29)ow, and we an expet the results to be qualitatively valid for the

Bessel interation as long as the vorties are not (cid:16)too far(cid:17) from eah other.

Integrability of a point vortex system depends primarily on two things:

the number of vorties N , and the shape of the domain D , oupied by the

(cid:29)uid [22, 28, 16℄. For eah domain shape, there exists a ritial number

Nmax , suh that motion of Nmax vorties in D is integrable no matter what

vortex strengths and positions are, and for some ombination of Nmax + 1

vorties their motion is haoti. Critial number depends on the symmetry

of the (cid:29)uid domain. On an unbounded plane three-point-vortex system is

always integrable, and motion of four vorties is in general haoti, so that

Nmax(R

2) = 3. For less symmetrial domains Nmax dereases, beause of the

7

absene of orresponding (cid:28)rst integrals, e.g. for a half-plane and for a irular

domain Nmax = 2, due to the absene of translational/rotational symmetry.

In this paper we onsider a ase of three vorties in an unbounded domain.

We restrit our attention to the relative motion of vorties, taking inter-

vortex distanes Ri as prime variables. The notation we use is illustrated in

Fig. 1. The invariane of the Hamiltonian (4) under translations allows us a

free hoie of the oordinate origin, whih we put to the enter of vortiity

(when it exists). Then, the other two onstants of motion (energy and angular

momentum) written in a frame independent form beome:

The physial system being de(cid:28)ned, we shall now fous on the near ol-

lapse on(cid:28)guration. As mentioned earlier, for the three point vortex problem,

(7)

(8)

under ertain onditions, whih depends both on the initial onditions, and

the vortex strengths, the motion is self similar, leading either to the ollapse

of the three vorties in a (cid:28)nite time, or by time reversal, to an in(cid:28)nite expan-

sion of the triangle formed by the vorties. These onditions of a ollapse or

an in(cid:28)nite expansion of the three point vorties are:

K = 0

1
ki

Xi

= 0 ,

(9)

(10)

i.e, the harmoni mean of the vortex strengths (10) and the total angular

momentum in its frame free form (9), are both zero. Near a ollapse on-

(cid:28)guration, the two onditions (9), (10) allow two di(cid:27)erent ways to approah

the singularity. Namely, we an hange initial onditions whih hanges the

value of K , or hange the vortex strength and modify the harmoni mean.

Unfortunately the motion of the three vorties even though integrable is not

easily omputed analytially. It then seemed useful to restrit the problem

to some less general ase, assuming that the basi mehanisms of ollapse

should not di(cid:27)er muh in the general ase. To emphasize this last statement,

let us (cid:28)rst onsider a general ollapse situation, for whih the total strength

is ktot . The following onditions are then ful(cid:28)lled

ki = ktot ,

(12)

The values for the vortex strengths orresponding to a ollapse on(cid:28)guration

are therefore loated on the irle resulting from the intersetion of the sphere

of radius ktot

and the plane imposing a total vortex strength equal to ktot .

2

Sine we have a irle, we shall assume that, from this point of view, no speial

on(cid:28)guration exists, and any should be su(cid:30)ient to desribe qualitatively the

di(cid:27)erent possible behaviors.

In the following we will be onsidering the ase, when two of the three

vorties are idential. Sine the resaling of time sales leads to a freedom in

vortex strength normalization, we will assume

k2 = k3 = 1

(13)

Then, in order for a ollapse to happen, the strength of the third vortex has

to satisfy (10) whih gives the resonane value of the (cid:28)rst vortex: k1c =

1/2.

3 Near-ollapse dynamis of vorties

In the ase when two out of three vorties are idential, there exists a on-

venient representation of the system dynamis in terms of a motion of a

partile in a one-dimensional potential, parametrially depending on vortex

initial ondition. To derive this representation, we introdue a new set of

variables: X = R2

1 , Y = R2

2R2

3 , and Z = R2

2 + R2

(23)

Thus, dynamis of vortex on(cid:28)guration is governed by an e(cid:27)etive Hamil-

tonian Hef f , where the shape of the potential well V depends on the initial

vortex positions through the values of (cid:28)rst integrals Λ and K (16), and the

strength of the (cid:28)rst vortex k .

E(cid:27)etive Hamiltonian representation (22), gives a number of advantages,

allowing to use simple standard tehniques for one-dimensional onservative

systems to (cid:28)nd dynamial properties of vortex motion. In a sense, the prob-

lem is redued to determining the shape of the potential V as a funtion of

its parameters.

Before proeeding to the analysis of the types of potentials, emerging in

our problem, we have to mention the restritions, imposed on the system

by the fat that three vorties form a triangle. Sine this was not taken

13

into aount in the derivation of the e(cid:27)etive Hamiltonian (22), it may put

additional boundaries on the possible values of X . Note, that sine the

e(cid:27)etive energy Hef f in (22) is always zero, a motion exists only on the

segments where the potential is negative. Therefore, triangle inequalities and

the ondition V

The ondition (25) is equivalent to the positiveness of the right hand side

Now we have a preise information on where the motion should lie, and

an proeed to the study of di(cid:27)erent regimes of near-ollapse dynamis.

Although the e(cid:27)etive potential representation is valid for any k

= 0, we

will restrit our study (and our de(cid:28)nition of (cid:16)near-ollapse(cid:17)) to the interval

k

]0; 1[, sine the speial ases k = 1 (esaping vortex pair) and k = 2

∈

(neutral tripole), as well as the degenerate ase k = 0 (two vorties and a

passive partile) bring up their spei(cid:28) singularities, unrelated to the ollapse

phenomenon. Let us onsider di(cid:27)erent regimes suh that eah regime or-

responds to a lass of qualitatively similar motions [20℄. Using the e(cid:27)etive

Hamiltonian representation (22), we infer that di(cid:27)erent regimes may be en-

ountered orresponding to the number of roots of the potential V (X; Λ, K, k)

lying within the physial domain. This number hanges with variation of the

parameters (Λ, K, k).

Note, that the absolute value of K depends on the length units and an be

saled out of the problem. Indeed, the potential V and the physial domain

boundary (27) are invariant under the saling transformation (ompare to

the problem will orrespond to the values (29), although we will keep K as a

sale parameter in formulas, keeping in mind, that only its sign is relevant to

distinguish di(cid:27)erent regimes. Note that the saling of Λ in (28), whih an

leaves Λ and H unhanged, when δ = 0, i.e. when vortex strengths exatly

satisfy the ollapse ondition (10). The sales of the motion are determined

by the value of the angular momentum K , while from a pure energeti point

of view the motion would be thought as sale invariant.

3.1 Critial situations for K

= 0

To detet bifurations, leading to the appearane of new roots of the poten-

tial, we look for the degenerate roots of (21). As a (cid:28)rst step, we just want to

(cid:28)nd these roots, leaving their detailed interpretation for the following para-

graphs. Suh roots Xc exist only for ertain ritial values Λc of the energy

parameter Λ, and an be found from:

(31)

V (Xc, Λc) = 0

∂V /∂X(Xc, Λc) = 0





The above system an be easily solved if one noties, that the potential (21)

is written in a fatorized form: V = V1

V2/(2k2Y 2), with

−

(32)

Then, if a solution Xc, Λc exists and is di(cid:27)erent from X = 0, it should be

either a double zero of V1 or V2 , or a zero of both V1 and V2 .

We start from (cid:28)nding a double zero of V2 , whih yields a system similar

to (31), where V is substituted by V2 , that leads to:

(34)

For Xc1 to be positive, K and δ must have the same sign, so this bifuration

pertains to the physial region only for the ases K > 0, k < 1/2 and

K < 0, k > 1/2 (it is easy to hek that substitution of (34) into (27) turns

the latter into an identity). Another solution, X = K, Λ = 0, orresponds

to the situation when the negative vortex merges with one of the two others,

reduing the system to a two-vortex ase. Notie that Xc1 diverge as vortex

strength ollapse ondition (10) is approahed (δ

announes a speial behavior of the ase δ = 0, requiring a speial treatment.

Double zeros of V1 are found in the same manner. After some algebra we

obtain:

Xc2 = Xc1/ (1

Λc2 = (1 + 2δ)Λc1/2

and a solution X = K/(1

proportional to Xc1 , Xc2 diverges in the same manner as δ

k), Λ = 0 for the merged situation. Being

0, and requires

→

sign of K and δ to be the same, in order to lie in a physial range. It also

diverges when k

1, as we have mentioned earlier, this is the ase of a

→

sattering of a neutral vortex pair on a vortex, whih is out of the sope of

the present paper. Finally we note, that sine V1 is proportional to the area

of the vortex triangle A, the ritial equilibrium position Xc2 orresponds

to an aligned vortex on(cid:28)guration; in a similar manner we dedue that Xc1

orresponds to an equilateral on(cid:28)guration [20, 24℄.

A third possibility, when both V1 = 0 and V2 = 0, leads to the following

system:

whih yields:

This ritial ase also orresponds to an aligned on(cid:28)guration, where the

negative vortex of strength −

k is in the middle between the two idential

(36)

(37)

vorties.

In near ollapse situation 2

k > 0, and sine Xc3 has to be

−

positive, this ritial situation appears only for positive total vortex angular

momentum K > 0. Here a merged solution also exists (X = 0, Λ = +

∞),

whih orresponds to the merging of the two idential vorties. We also

notie that the divergene of Xc3 for k = 2 orresponds to a speial ase of

a neutral tripole, when the total vortiity is zero, and the enter of vortiity

is not de(cid:28)ned.

Now we turn our attention to the three di(cid:27)erent spei(cid:28) ases distin-

guished by the sign of K . For eah ase, we will indiate whih of the above

found bifurations do our, and study the phase spae tra jetories of the

e(cid:27)etive Hamiltonian (22) for di(cid:27)erent regimes.

3.2 The ase K > 0, k

= 1/2

From the previous setion, we know that the number of ritial energies for

this ase depends on the sign of δ , i.e. whether k > 1/2 or k < 1/2. A

speial ase k = 1/2, δ = 0 will be treated separately. We start from the

ase k < 1/2, when all three ritial ases (34), (35), (37) belong to the

physial region. If we keep the value of k (cid:28)xed, and vary the energy, we will

enounter various motion regimes, separated by the three ritial energies.

To illustrate the ritial situations we plotted the potential V as a funtion

of X for the three di(cid:27)erent ritial energies for k = 0.2 in Fig. 2. The ritial

energy Λc1 orresponds to the maximum possible value for whih motion

an exist; for Λ = Λc2 an unstable equilibrium (saddle point) appears, and

19

6
motion beomes aperiodi; and in the last ase of Λ = Λc3 , another saddle

point appears right on the border of the physial region (orresponding to

unstable aligned on(cid:28)guration).

Motions regimes for di(cid:27)erent energy ranges are listed below:

1. Λ > Λc1 Motion impossible.

2. Λc1 > Λ > Λc2 The potential has 2 zeros in the physial region, there

exists a single type of periodi motion (see Fig. 3). When Λ

to proximity of a saddle-point; motion aquires typial near-separatrix

harater of relatively short veloity pulses separated by long stays in

the saddle-point viinity.

3. Λc2 > Λ > Λc3 The potential has 4 zeros and two di(cid:27)erent types of

periodi motion exist (see Fig. 4). Their period diverges as T (Λ)

Λc3 (from both sides), the small-

For the ase k > 1/2 only the ritial value of Xc3 lies in the physial

region, and only one regime of periodi motion exists (see Fig. 7).

20

3.3 The ase K < 0, k

= 1/2

When the total vortex angular momentum is negative, the ritial root (37)

lies outside the physial region, and therefore we expet less variety of motion

types. Otherwise, this ase is similar to the K > 0 ase, in the sense that

most phenomena desribed for K > 0 our, but in a reverse order; for

instane, when k > 1/2 we have three di(cid:27)erent regimes, whih are analogue

to the regimes of K > 0, k < 1/2 ase. The di(cid:27)erent regimes, illustrated by

their phase portraits, are listed below:

1. Λ < Λc1 Motion impossible.

2. Λc2 < Λ < Λc1 The potential has 2 zeros and a periodi motion is

possible (see Fig. 8). In viinity of a saddle point (Λ

Λc2 ) motion

≈

period diverges in the same way as in K > 0 ase.

3. Λc2 < Λ The potential has 4 zeros and two di(cid:27)erent periodi motions

are possible (see Fig. 9).

On the other hand the situation when k < 1/2, is analogous to the K > 0

and k > 1/2 situation. Namely, non of the ritial values are physial, and

we have only one type of periodi motion for all range of energies, see Fig. 10.

Now all the possible generi situations being desribed, we will proeed

to the important singular ases K = 0 or k = 1/2.

21

3.4 The ase K = 0.

In this situation any resaling of length does not a(cid:27)et the value of K , and

it is only the value of Λ that ontrols motion sales in the system. The

expression for the e(cid:27)etive potential V (X) an be onsiderably simpli(cid:28)ed. It

is onvenient to introdue new variable

In this situation double zero do not our. Note that for exat ollapse ase,

k = 1/2, transformation to new variable (38) is singular and does not work.

In this ase the potential V (X) is onstant; its value is negative only in a

range of energies Λ

[1/2, 1], whih means, that ollapse on(cid:28)gurations have

∈

their on(cid:28)ned to this interval. We will return to the disussion of ollapse

on(cid:28)gurations in setion 4.

In this singular ase, to visualize the approah to ollapse (k

1/2),

→

22

it is better to have k (cid:29)utuating and Λ (cid:28)xed. This is due to the fat that,

when k = 1/2, whih orresponds to the merging onditions, the motion is

possible only within a range of energies Λ2 > Λ > Λ1 . The phase portrait

of tra jetories taken for di(cid:27)erent values of k is shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12.

These two (cid:28)gures are taken lose to the values Λ = 1/2 and Λ = 1; we notie

for the k = 1/2 ase two straight lines orresponding to the two possible

motions of expansion or ollapse. Note, that when Λ /
∈

[1/2 , 1] a ollapse

annot our, whih means that the tra jetories for k < 1/2 and k > 1/2 are

similar to those shown in Fig. 11, but do not interset on the top view.

3.5 The ase k = 1/2

This speial ase orresponds to (cid:16)sale invariane(cid:17), meaning that any length

an be resaled without hanging the energy of the system. Therefore the

energies of the ritial situations should not depend on the value of K , whih

is sale dependent. The e(cid:27)etive potential is now simply a fration of poly-

nomial and an be rewritten as

We have three ritial values, the (cid:28)rst two Λc1 = 1 and Λc2 = 1/2 orrespond

to the divergene of one root, while the third Λc3 = 1/4 orresponds to a

double root situation X2 = X3 . Depending on the sign of K we have the

following allowed supports:

1. K > 0 and Λ < Λc3 implies X1 > X > X2 . The potential V (X) for

the ritial situation Λ = 1/4 is illustrated on Fig. 13. As we approah

ollapse (K

0) this motion vanishes.

2. K > 0 and Λc3 < Λ < Λc2 implies X1 > X > X3 . The potential

V (X) for the ritial situation Λ = 1/2 is illustrated on Fig. 14. As

we approah ollapse (K

(see the Appendix for its derivation). Phase spae portraits of the

tra jetories are illustrated in Fig. 16.

3. K > 0 and Λc2 < Λ < Λc1 , then X > X3 . This motion is the losest to

the ollapse, as in(cid:28)nite expansion is possible, but X is bounded from

24

below. In this situation we may see a ollapse ourse, whih rebounds

on X3 and goes for an in(cid:28)nite expansion. As we approah ollapse

5. K < 0 and Λc2 < Λ < Λc1 , then X > X1 . We have a similar situation

as the one disussed for the K > 0 and Λc2 < Λ < Λc1 .

6. K < 0 and Λc1 < Λ, then X3 > X > X1 . Here we an antiipate a

similar situation as the one disussed for the K > 0 and Λc3 < Λ < Λc2 .

4 Collapse senarii

As we have mentioned earlier, for the ollapse to happen, two "resonane on-

ditions" have to be satis(cid:28)ed. First, the sum of the vortex strengths inverses

have to be zero. This ondition does not impose any geometrial restritions

on vortex positions, for a given system of vorties it is either satis(cid:28)ed or

not. Initial positions leading to ollapse are spei(cid:28)ed by the seond ollapse

ondition, K = 0. It also de(cid:28)nes the range of energies, for whih the self-

similar dynamis an our (for k = 1/2), but does not tell in whih diretion

(ollapse or expansion) it will go.

For a given vortex on(cid:28)guration, let us onsider a oordinate system

with x-axis passing through the two positive vorties (k1 = k2 = 1) and an

In the (cid:16)resonant(cid:17) ase k = 1/2, the ritial irle represents a set of initial

onditions leading to a self-similar ollapse or expansion. Level lines of Λ

ross the irle in four points for Λ

[1/2; 1], see Figure 17. These points

∈

are re(cid:29)etions of eah other in the oordinate axes, this symmetry leads the

oordinate axis to divide the plane in four dynamially equivalent quadrants.

A re(cid:29)etion of a vortex on(cid:28)guration is equivalent to hanging the diretion

of time, so that points in adjaent quadrants have opposite diretions of their

dynamis. From the original equations (8), we dedue, that the parts of the

ritial irle lying in the I and III quadrants lead to a (cid:28)nite-time ollapse,

and those in II and IV quadrants to an in(cid:28)nite self-similar expansion.

Four intersetions of the ritial irle with the oordinate axes are equi-

librium positions, where Λ reahes its limiting values (on the irle); the

maximum value Λ = 1 orresponds to the equilateral triangle, and the mini-

mum Λ = 1/2 to ollinear on(cid:28)guration.

We de(cid:28)ne a rate of ol lapse as a rate of hange of the squared distane

41

between the two positive vorties, i.e. as

˙X . In this ase, self-similar motion

will have onstant rate of ollapse.

Indeed, vortex veloities are inversely

proportional to the inter-vortex distanes, so that

˙X = 2R1 ˙R1 is independent

of the sale of the motion. The rate of ollapse is determined by the vortex

energy:

˙X(Λ) =

4(1

Λ2)(1/4

Λ2),

−

q

−

(46)

it tends to zero when Λ approahes one of the equilibrium values Λ = 1/2, 1.

In general, approahing ollapse means taking the limits K

0 and

→

0.5. These limits are not ommutative, and for ertain situations, the

k

→

result depends on how the limits are taken, e.g.

these limits may indue

the divergene of Xc1,2 or set them to zero or any value. Therefore a three

vortex system an approah ollapse in a number of di(cid:27)erent ways. For

instane, if we take one limit after another, we an obtain the properties of

the motion from the ases listed in Ÿ3.4 and Ÿ3.5. It is also interesting to

study some of the senarios, when the limits K

0+−

and k

0.5+−

are

→

→

taken simultaneously, leading to an interplay of di(cid:27)erent situations, desribed

in the previous setion. As an example, onsider a limit K

0+

, k

0.5−

→

→

taken along the line K/δ = C , where C is a onstant.

In this ase, the

saddle-point ritial values (Xc2, Λc2 tend to (C, 1/2), i.e. the sale of the

inner potential well (bounded by Xc2 ) stay the same. At the same time the

outer potential well spreads to in(cid:28)nity (see Fig 4 and Fig. 11), and we have

a situation, when two types of motion, orresponding to the same value of

42

vortex energy, have entirely di(cid:27)erent length sales.

5 Traer advetion near ollapse

As we have mentioned, a prominent feature of near ollapse dynamis is a

generation of new length sales, whih an di(cid:27)er from the length sale of the

original on(cid:28)guration by orders of magnitude (see for instane (44)). This

property has a strong in(cid:29)uene on the mixing properties of the vortex (cid:29)ow.

As an illustration, we ompare the motion of passive partiles (traers) in a

veloity (cid:28)eld of a near ollapse on(cid:28)guration, with that in a typial (cid:16)far from

ollapse(cid:17) (cid:29)ow. A stream funtion of the (cid:29)ow, indued by moving vorties

of a far from ollapse (cid:29)ow is presented. A large onneted mixing region,

regular ores around vorties, ellipti islands are typial elements of a traer

phase spae in three-vortex (cid:29)ows [17, 29℄. Two most important length sales

in the advetion pattern, assoiated with its robust features, are the outer

radius of the mixing region and the radii of vortex ores. Generally, these two

sales are omparable (their ratio is about one order of magnitude or less).

However in advetion patterns of near ollapse vortex on(cid:28)gurations, these

length sales beome onsiderably di(cid:27)erent, as the ore radii tend to zero

when approahing ollapse see Fig. 19. The (cid:28)gures Fig. 18 and Fig. 19 are

showed to emphasize that traers haoti dynamis in the near ollapse ase,

is di(cid:27)erent than the dynamis without ollapse. A more detailed analysis

will be desribed in another artile.

6 Conlusion

The behavior of a three point vortex system in a near ollapse state, studied

in this paper, shows a number of nontrivial dynamial features, that may play

an important role in studies of more general two-dimensional (cid:29)ows. In par-

tiular, a possibility of vortiity onentration allows one to speulate on the

fat that the ollapse situation exhibits some basis mehanisms whih ould

trigger 2D turbulene, and in the same spirit, raise the question whether or

45

not the statistis made out of the Grand Canonial Ensemble are physially

relevant. The study of vortex motion near the ritial situations, has also

revealed itself interesting in exhibiting non-generi power-law growth of the

period in Ÿ3.5. The sale invariane property of the ollapse on(cid:28)gurations,

implies the possibility of new length sale generation. In the viinity of the

degenerate ases observed in Ÿ3.2 and Ÿ3.3, a small perturbation, for instane

a sound wave, or orretions to the vortex Hamiltonian due to (cid:28)nite vortex

size, would allow to jump from one motion type to the other. Sine the two

motion types orrespond to very di(cid:27)erent length sales, these jumps ould

be assoiated with vortex ollapse or vortex splitting.

Another onsequene of the peuliar harater of near ollapse dynamis

onerns properties of passive partile advetion in the (cid:29)ows generated by

suh systems.

In this paper we limit ourselves to a short illustration of

how the approah to ollapse in(cid:29)uenes a degree of traer mixing; a more

detailed study of this topi will be presented elsewhere. For instane, it

is interesting, how the sale invariane of the Hamiltonian in ase δ = 0,

a(cid:27)ets traer phase spae topology, whih is then de(cid:28)ned solely by the value

of K . To onlude, we emphasize one again the fat, that near ollapse

dynamis omprises several types of motion. Their time and length sales

di(cid:27)er onsiderably, depending on the way the ollapse onditions are violated,

whih makes a problem of an e(cid:27)et of small perturbations on self-similar

ontrating (unstable) spiral motion very interesting.

A Power-law divergene

From the e(cid:27)etive Hamiltonian (22) the period of the motion in the ase

k = 1/2 and for instane K > 0 and Λ < 1/2 (see Fig. 15) is then simply

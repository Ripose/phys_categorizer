Abstract

We develop and analyze a model for ratchet-driven macroscopic transport of a continuous phase. The

transport relies on a ﬁeld-induced dewetting-spreading cycle of a liquid ﬁlm with a free surface based on

a switchable, spatially asymmetric, periodic interaction of the liquid-gas interface and the substrate. The

concept is exempliﬁed using an evolution equation for a dielectric liquid ﬁlm under an inhomogeneous

voltage. We analyse the inﬂuence of the various phases of the ratchet cycle on the transport properties.

Conditions for maximal transport and the efﬁciency of transport under load are discussed.

Brownian ratchets present a well established way to induce directed motion of particles in spa-

tially extended systems without global gradients, i.e. without a globally broken spatial symmetry

[1, 2, 3]. Examples include colloidal particles suspended in solution that move when exposed

to a sawtooth dielectric potential [4] and the selective particle ﬁlter formed by a micro-fabricated

silicon membrane with asymmetrical bottleneck-like pores under application of an oscillating pres-

sure gradient [5]. Brownian ratchets are also thought to represent the underlying mechanism of

molecular motors that are responsible for the active transport of molecules along ﬁlaments in bi-

ological cells [6]. Brownian transport is based on a principle ﬁrst pointed out by Pierre Curie [7]

stating that also a macroscopically symmetric constellation may induce macroscopic transport if it

exhibits local asymmetries, e.g. a periodic asymmetric potential that varies on a small length scale.

However, the system has to be kept out of equilibrium, for instance, by a chemical reaction [6], an

oscillating pressure [5] or electric potential [4].

Ratchets are not only used to transport or ﬁlter discrete objects like colloidal particles or macro-

molecules. A ratchet geometry may also serve to induce a macroscopic transport of a continuous

phase using local gradients only. Experimentally investigated examples include a secondary liq-

uid ﬂow triggered in Marangoni-B´enard convection involving a solid substrate with asymmetric

grooves [8]. On a similar substrate Leidenfrost drops perform a directed motion [9, 10]. Micro-

drops conﬁned in asymmetrically structured geometries move when vibrating the substrate or ap-

plying an on/off electric ﬁeld [11].

In this Letter we propose and analyse a simple generic model for ratchet driven free-surface

ﬂows resulting in the macroscopic transport of a continuous phase. The driving ﬂashing ratchet is

based on a switchable spatially periodic but asymmetric interaction of the liquid-gas interface and

the solid substrate like, for instance, a ﬁeld-induced wettability. One can envision several ways

to experimentally realise the spatially inhomogeneous interaction and the switching in time. A

simple setup consists of a thin ﬁlm of dielectric liquid in a capacitor producing a sawtooth voltage

proﬁle when switched on. The electro-dewetting provoked by the application of a homogeneous

electrical ﬁeld is already used to structure thin ﬁlms of liquid polymers [12, 13, 14].

An idealized electrical wettability ratchet (sketched in Fig. 1) works as follows. We consider

a ﬂat wetting ﬁlm stable in the absence of an electric ﬁeld (Fig. 1 (a)). Upon switching on an

electric ﬁeld at t = 0 (Fig. 1 (e)) the ﬁlm is destabilized by both, the overall electric ﬁeld and

its local gradients (Fig. 1 (d)). This behavior is similar to dewetting on a heterogeneous substrate

[15, 16]. After a transient it results in the collection of all the liquid in drops situated at the patches

of maximal voltage (Fig. 1 (b)). After switching off the ﬁeld at t = τ (Fig. 1 (e)) the drops spread

into a homogeneous wetting layer (Fig. 1 (c)). Finally, at t = T the ﬁeld is switched on again and

a new cycle starts. A typical realistic ﬁlm dynamics during one ratchet cycle is shown in Fig. 2.

For the geometry in Fig. 1 (d), with a voltage proﬁle shaped like a sawtooth skewed to the right,

each cycle transports liquid to the right.

The inhomogeneous electric ﬁeld represents one out of several possible choices for a switchable

spatially asymmetric interaction of liquid-gas interface and substrate. Others not pursued here

include switchable brushes [17], heating [18, 19] or the switching of optical substrate properties,

i.e. van der Waals interactions. Note however, that although length and time scales and the speciﬁc

form of the resulting interaction potentials will differ, in principle all these realizations can be

mapped onto our model using appropriate pressure terms corresponding to an effective switchable

3

’wettability’.

In presenting the dynamical model we restrict our attention to a two-dimensional system corre-

sponding to a shallow open channel geometry and neglect the inﬂuence of the channel walls. The

interplay of ﬁeld-driven dewetting, liquid motion caused by local lateral gradients and spreading

for small scale systems, i.e. of wettability and capillarity dominated ﬂuid ﬂow, is well described

using an evolution equation for the ﬁlm thickness proﬁle [20]. A derivation from the basic trans-

port equations using lubrication approximation gives

(cid:20)

(1)

where γ and η are the surface tension and dynamic viscosity of the liquid, respectively. fext

denotes an external force in the direction of the x-axis. The change in time of the ﬁlm thickness

proﬁle is given by the divergence of the ﬂow, expressed as the product of a mobility and a pressure

gradient and/or external force. The velocity ﬁeld within the ﬁlm is fully determined by the ﬁlm
thickness proﬁle. The velocity parallel to the substrate is u(x, z) = (z2/2 − zh) ∂xp and the

vertical component is obtained using continuity. The pressure

p = − γ∂xxh − Π(h, x, t)

(2)

contains the curvature pressure −γ∂xxh and the disjoining pressure Π(h, x, t). The latter com-

prises the effective interactions between the liquid-gas interface and the substrate, i.e. the wetta-

bility properties [20, 21, 22]. Note, that the lubrication approximation can be formally applied

to systems involving small surface slopes only. However, even for partially wetting systems with

large contact angles, the lubrication approximation predicts in most cases the correct qualitative

behavior [20].

As model system we use a dielectric oil in a capacitor of gap width d. The oil wets the lower

plate and does not wet the upper plate corresponding to the van der Waals disjoining pressure

Figure 2 shows a typical example of the ﬁlm evolution during one ratchet cycle allowing to dis-

tinguish four phases. (i) When the ratchet is switched on the ﬁlm is nearly ﬂat but rapidly evolves

a surface instability with a wavelength given approximately by the corresponding spinodal length

[20]. (ii) Next, the evolving proﬁle coarsens accelerated by the gradients of the ratchet potential.

(iii) In an ideal situation only one drop remains, corresponding to the equilibrium structure on the

heterogeneous wettability pattern produced by the ratchet potential [16]. (iv) Finally, after switch-

ing off the ratchet the drop starts to spread rapidly under the inﬂuence of van der Waals forces

until the next cycle starts.

FIG. 3: Dependence of the mean velocity ¯v on the liquid level in the capacitor, i.e. on the mean ﬁlm

thickness ¯h, for various ﬂashing periods T as indicated in the legend. The remaining parameters are as in

Fig. 2.

The competing inﬂuence of the various parameters allows to tune the transport properties by

adjusting the relative importance of the various phases. As shown in Fig. 3 the transport is strongest

for intermediate ﬁlm thicknesses. A ﬁlm of intermediate thickness in a homogeneous electric ﬁeld

(Φ(x) = Ω(t) = 1) dewets spinodally with a wavelength well below the used spatial period of the

6

ratchet. Therefore the ongoing coarsening interacts with the ﬂow induced by the spatial asymmetry

and leads to a nontrivial dependence of the mean velocity on the ﬁlm thickness. For very small or

large ﬁlm thicknesses the stabilizing van der Waals terms are dominating and the mean velocity

approaches rapidly zero. Note also the ﬂow reversal, albeit with a small mean velocity, for large
¯h & 0.85. Further calculations (not shown) demonstrate the monotonous increase of the mean

velocity with increasing asymmetry ratio φ or amplitude ψ of the ratchet potential for otherwise

constant parameters.

FIG. 4: Variation of the mean velocity ¯v in dependence of (a) the ﬂashing ratio ω (for T=500) and (b) the

ﬂashing period T (for ω = 1) for various ﬁlm thicknesses as given in the legends. The remaining parameters

are as in Fig. 2.

The ﬂashing characteristics of the ratchet have a very pronounced effect on the transport. Fig-

ures 4 (a) and (b) present the non-monotonous dependencies of the ﬂow on the ﬂashing ratio ω and

period T , respectively. For small ω the ﬂow is practically zero, since the time for dewetting is too

short to trap a considerable amount of liquid at the spots of high wettability. Increasing ω increases

the velocity until it reaches a maximum at ω ≈ 1. Beyond the maximum the ﬂow decreases again

because less and less time remains for the spreading. For large ω one observes a ﬂow reversal.

The dependence of the velocity on the ﬂashing period T is similar but shows around the ﬂow

maximum a particularly interesting non-monotonous behavior that is due to coarsening. For small

periods the ﬂuid has neither enough time to dewet nor to spread and the resulting mean transport

is small. For large periods both processes reach the respective equilibrium structure well before

the next switching, i.e. most time is spend waiting and the mean velocity decreases approximately

7

as 1/T .

Assuming an ideal combination of ratchet properties and intrinsic length and time scales, and

approximating the intermediate drops at the ﬁeld maxima as point-like objects, all the liquid moves
by a − L/2 in one cycle of length T . For a ﬁlm of mean thickness ¯h this yields a mean ﬂow of
¯jideal = ¯h(a − L/2)/T , i.e. the mean velocity is ¯videal = (a − L/2)/T . The maximal spatial
asymmetry is given by a = L, i.e. ¯jmax = ¯hL/2T and ¯vmax = L/2T . In a real system, however,

several effects keep the mean velocity below the ideal value. For optimal parameters in simulations
we reach about 30% of ¯videal (Fig. 4 (b) for ¯h = 0.7 and T ≈ 10000).

For practical applications transport against an external force is of crucial importance. In the

reference system of a uniform substrate no work is performed and all energy is lost via viscous

dissipation. This is not the case for a thin ﬁlm ratchet under load, i.e. fext 6= 0 in (1). Switching

off the ratchet, fext < 0 induces a negative macroscopic ﬂow. Simple mechanical realizations of

fext are an inclined substrate or centrifugal forces yielding a constant fext independent of the ﬁlm

thickness. The ﬂashing ratchet generates a positive ﬂow, i.e. mechanical work is performed against

the external force. The transport under load is characterized by the (mechanical) energy transport

denotes the interaction energy consumed per time. The mean velocity and transport efﬁciency are

shown in Figs. 5 (a) and (b). The transport efﬁciency behaves non-monotonically. It increases for

small loads, reaches a maximum and decreases for higher loads. It becomes negative when the

ﬂow reverses. Then the ratchet can no longer perform work against the external force.

Finally, we discuss the feasibility of a ﬂuid ratchet employing spatially inhomogeneous electric

ﬁelds by estimating the acting forces and relevant time and length scales for millimetric, micro-

scopic and nanoscopic ﬂuidic systems. Typical material constants for thin ﬁlms in capacitors are

taken from [23, 24, 25] and references therein. Applying a voltage of 100 V over a gap of 2 mm
width, a 1 mm ﬁlm of silicon oil feels an electrostatic pressure of pel ≈ 0.1N m−2 corresponding

approximately to the curvature pressure in a drop of 1 mm height with θ0 = 10 ◦ equilibrium con-

tact angle. Thinner ﬁlms can be inﬂuenced by a lower voltage [12]. For instance, for a 10 µm oil
ﬁlm in a 20 µm gap for U0 = 10 V we ﬁnd pel ≈ 10 N m−2, equivalent to the curvature pressure
in a droplet of 10 µm height and θ0 = 10 ◦. In principle, nanoﬂuidic transport of polymer melts

is also feasible. For a 30 nm ﬁlm of liquid polystyrene in a 100 nm gap which is electrostatically
patterned (U0 = 10 V) [25], pel ≈ 104N/m2 equivalent to the curvature pressure for a droplet of

30 nm height and 300 nm width. Note, however, that for ultrathin ﬁlms the disjoining pressure is

of the same order of magnitude [22].

Beside the length scales also the time scales are of uttermost importance. The scale τ =

3γη/dκ2
el reﬂects the relevant properties responsible for the relaxation towards the ﬂat ﬁlm. For
a 5cS silicon oil the estimate gives a timescale of 10 to 103 s, i.e. the viscous ﬂow is rather slow.

Using, however, water ﬁlms of thicknesses between 10 µm (U0 = 10V) and 1 mm (U0 = 100V)
the time scale ranges from 10−5 to 10−3 s resulting in fast transport.

In conclusion, we have shown that a ﬂashing ratchet produces a macroscopic transport in a

liquid ﬁlm with a free surface on a feasible time scale. There exist regimes of maximum transport

selected by the spatial and temporal properties of the ratchet, which depend on the characteristics

of the thin ﬁlm. For a spatial period of the ratchet which is considerably larger than the length scale

of the spinodal instability of the ﬂat ﬁlm subjected to a homogeneous potential the coarsening

dynamics inﬂuences the transport in a non-trivial way.

We present direct numerical simulations and α-model simulations of four familiar three-dimensional magne-
tohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence effects: selective decay, dynamic alignment, inverse cascade of magnetic
helicity, and the helical dynamo effect. The MHD α-model is shown to capture the long-wavelength spectra in
all these problems, allowing for a signiﬁcant reduction of computer time and memory at the same kinetic and
magnetic Reynolds numbers. In the helical dynamo, not only does the α-model correctly reproduce the growth
rate of magnetic energy during the kinematic regime, but it also captures the nonlinear saturation level and the
late generation of a large scale magnetic ﬁeld by the helical turbulence.

INTRODUCTION

The “alpha model,” as it has come to be called in ﬂuid me-
chanics, is a procedure whereby, by suppressing small spa-
tial scales in a computation in a way that intends to do mini-
mum damage to the accuracy with which the long wavelength
spectral components are calculated, one can realize substantial
savings in computing time [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13]. In a previous paper [14], we gave a simple way to extend
the alpha model to magnetohydrodynamics (see also [9, 10]
for extensions in the non-dissipative case), we specialized it to
two dimensions, and numerically tested its predictions in a se-
ries of computations. These were chosen as situations where
direct numerical simulations (DNS) that started from identi-
cal initial conditions were feasible. The intent of this present
paper is to present comparisons of the same kind for three-
dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). This is a
straightforward program in the light of the two-dimensional
(2D) investigations [14] and we will draw heavily on the ma-
terial in that paper to avoid repetition, but in 3D, new phenom-
ena arise, such as the generation of magnetic ﬁelds through
stretching by velocity gradients, and furthermore 3D is com-
putationally more demanding than 2D.

In Section II, we take the 3D alpha model MHD equations
[14] and describe brieﬂy four problems upon which they will
be tested against DNS treatments of the same problems. They
are selective decay, dynamic alignment, the inverse cascade of
magnetic helicity, and the mechanically driven turbulent dy-
namo. The ﬁrst two have already been tested in 2D [14] and
the third has a 2D analogue in the inverse cascade of magnetic
vector potential [14]. The fourth is also not an unfamiliar ef-
fect, and we have recently been involved in addressing it for
the special case of low magnetic Prandtl number [15] and for
non-helical ﬂows.

Our conclusions reached in Secs. III-VI are consistent for
the most part with those reached for 2D MHD: the alpha
model does a good job of reproducing the spectral behav-
ior of the long-wavelength Fourier amplitudes (wavenumber
k . α−1, where α is the spatial scale over which the velocity
ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld are ﬁltered). Because of the relative
lack of surprises in the selective decay and dynamic alignment
Sections, we rely on relatively brief presentations, to then fo-

cus in the study of the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity
and the dynamo effect. Finally, we summarize the results in
Sec. VII.

together with ∇ · v = 0 = ∇ · B.

The velocity ﬁeld is v, the magnetic ﬁeld is B = ∇ × A,
where A is the vector potential. The electric current density is
j = ∇× B and the vorticity is ω = ∇× v. The dimensionless
pressure, normalized to the (uniform) mass density is P, and
is obtained by taking the divergence of Eq. (1), using the in-
compressibility condition ∇ · v = 0, and solving the resulting
Poisson equation. Removing a curl from Eq. (2) gives

son equation by imposing the Coulomb gauge ∇ · A = 0.

units, U is a mean ﬂow speed and L is a length character-
istic of it. Similarly, η−1 can be interpreted as a magnetic
Reynolds number Rm = U L/η. The magnetic Prandtl num-
ber is Pm = ν/η = Rm/Re.

In the alpha model the ﬁelds v and B are smoothed but ω

and j are not [14, 16]. The prescription is

When we write ωs or As, we mean that the same smooth-
ing recipe as in Eqs. (4,5) has been applied to the unsmoothed
ﬁelds ω or A. It is possible, and sometimes desirable, to use
different smoothing lengths αv, αB for the mechanical and
magnetic quantities [14, 15].

E, HC and HM as deﬁned here are the ideal invariants of
Eqs. (12,13), and reduce, as α → 0, to the usual ideal 3D
MHD invariants. Sometimes, to make the global quantities
agree at t = 0 for initial-value runs, we may initially normal-
ize the Fourier coefﬁcients of the ﬁelds, by multiplication by
a common factor, to bring E and HC into exact initial agree-
ment with the corresponding numbers for the ideal 3D MHD
invariants (note that HM involves two smoothed ﬁelds, and
therefore can not be matched to the DNS initial conditions at
the same time). Hereafter, such global quantities as E, HC,
etc., will be referred to unit volume.

It is well known that for decaying turbulent situations, the
presence of enough initial HM or HC can lead to a late-
time state in which the ratios |HM /E| or |HC /E| can be
close to maximal. The ﬁrst situation, called “selective decay,”
[17, 18, 19] leads to a late-time quasi-steady state in which
the remaining energy is nearly all magnetic and is nearly all
condensed into the longest wavelength modes allowed by the
boundary conditions. The second situation, called “dynamic
alignment,” [20, 21, 22] leads to a late-time quasi-steady state
in which v and B are nearly parallel or anti-parallel. In both
cases, the states can be very long-lived because the nonlinear
transfer to small scales has essentially been shut down (“sup-
pression of nonlinearity”). We illustrate these two situations
in Secs. III and IV.

Inverse cascade processes [23, 24, 25, 26] are those wherein
excitations externally injected at the small scales are preferen-
tially transferred to the larger scales and pile up there, creating
coherent macroscopic structures at large scales where none
were present initially. A quantity which can be inversely cas-
caded in 3D MHD is HM [24, 25]. We illustrate this with an
externally-driven run in Sec. V.

Dynamo processes (see Ref. [27] for a review) are those
whereby mechanical injection of excitations transfer energy
to magnetic ﬁelds, causing them to amplify. A novel example
of helical dynamo action using the alpha-model is treated in
Sec. VI.

In all four cases, well-resolved DNS solutions are regarded
as baseline truths against which alpha-model computations are
to be tested.

In the presence of non-zero η and ν, the decay rates for E,

HC , and HM can readily been shown to be

III. SELECTIVE DECAY

In selective decays, energy decays rapidly relative to mag-
netic helicity, if any [17, 18, 19]. In order to display the pro-
cess most clearly, it helps to start an initial-value decay run
with a signiﬁcant amount of magnetic helicity. One way to
accomplish this is to make the initial values of v and B out of

what are called “ABC” ﬂows. We deﬁne

vABC = [B cos(ky) + C sin(kz)] ˆx +

+ [A sin(kx) + C cos(kz)] ˆy +
+ [A cos(kx) + B sin(ky)] ˆz

(20)

for arbitrary real numbers A, B, C, and k. vABC is an eigen-
function of the curl. The speciﬁc initial conditions chosen are

v(t = 0) =

The notation vABC (k, φk) means that for each k in the sum-
mation, a random phase φk is added to the arguments of the
sines and cosines for that k. The summations are over all the
k values (which lie on a lattice in k space deﬁned by the pe-
riodic boundary conditions) between radii kbot and ktop. The
ˆv(k) and ˆB(k) represent added random perturbations.

Here, we have chosen A = B = C = 1, kbot = 6, ktop =
10, and v0, b0 are chosen to make the initial

also the case that initially, hv · Bi = 0. Random modes ˆv(k)
and ˆB(k) are added with an energetic level to initially give
hA · Bi = 0.5 h|A||B|i. The dimensionless inverse Reynolds
numbers are ν = η = 0.002.

Three runs for a typical case are displayed. The ﬁrst of these
is a well-resolved DNS run at a resolution of 2563, with de-
aliasing achieved by zeroing out all Fourier coefﬁcients with
k > 256/3, a method that will be used throughout (usually
referred to as the “2/3 rule”). Then two α-model runs are
performed with the same initial conditions, a 1283 run with
α = 1/20 and a 643 run with α = 1/10. The same values
of ν, η apply to all three runs. The caption of Fig. 1.a iden-
tiﬁes the decaying energies (kinetic energy EK and magnetic
energy EM ) as functions of time. Fig. 1.b shows the ratio
hA · Bi / h|A||B|i as a function of time for the three runs; it
has increased to above 0.999 by the ﬁnal time.

Fig. 2 shows the (unnormalized) energies and magnetic he-
licities for the three runs. Note that by normalizing the DNS
and α-model initial conditions to have equal energies, it has
meant that the α-model magnetic helicities have necessarily
started at lower initial values than those of the DNS.

Figs. 3 and 4 show the associated energy spectra plotted vs.
wave number. Fig. 3 is at an early time (t = 10) and shows the
total energy spectrum compensated by Kolmogorov’s −5/3
law. Fig. 4 shows kinetic (EK) and magnetic (EM ) energy
spectra at a very late time (t = 733). The two values of α−1
are shown as vertical lines. Below k ∼ α−1, the DNS and
α-model agree reasonably well.

As follows from Figs. 2 and 4, at late times the magnetic
ﬁeld is concentrated at large scales (k = 1) and has maximum
relative helicity (note that E ∼ EM ∼ HM after t ∼ 200
in both the DNS and alpha-model simulations). Fig. 5 shows
surfaces of constant HM at t = 800 in the 3D domain, for the

DNS and the 643 alpha-model simulation. The alpha-model
is able to reproduce the large scale structures observed in the
DNS, and only slight differences can be observed. As will
be shown in Section IV this is not always the case when using
periodic boundary conditions (similar results were obtained in
2D MHD simulations [14]).

IV. DYNAMIC ALIGNMENT

In this case, we load Fourier coefﬁcients into the spherical
shells with kbot = 6 ≤ k ≤ ktop = 10 with equal ampli-
tudes but enough correlation between the phases of v and B
so that initially hv · Bi = 0.3 h|v||B|i; otherwise the phases

are random. We again do a 2563 DNS run, an α-model run
at 1283 with α = 1/20, and another α-model run at 643 with
α = 1/10. For all three runs, ν = η = 0.002. The same
conventions are adopted for the graphics as in Sec. III.

Figs. 6a,b show the decay of the kinetic and magnetic en-
ergies (a), chosen initially to be equal; and (b) the degree
of alignment, as measured by the mean cosine of the align-
ment angle, hus · Bi / h|us||B|i that develops as a function
of time. Since much of the alignment is contributed by the
small scales, the α-model underestimates the degree of align-

ment, and the disparity becomes greater as α−1 is decreased,
though the accuracy remains within the 10 percent level. Fig.
7 shows the decay of both E and Hc, with the more rapid
decay of the former. There is, in this case, no preferential
migration of any global quantity to long wavelengths.

Figures 8 and 9 show the kinetic and magnetic energy spec-
tra at an early time, t = 4.5, and at a late one, t = 156. The
agreement of the α-model and DNS for k . α−1 is again seen
to be excellent except for an unexplained over-estimate at the
earlier time t = 4.5 for the kinetic energy spectrum.

Fig. 10 shows surfaces of constant HC at t = 150 in the
3D domain, for the DNS and the 643 alpha-model simulation.
While there are marked similarities in the kinds of structures
present in the DNS and in the alpha runs, there are no one-
to-one correspondences as to speciﬁc features, either as to lo-
cation or orientation. As in the 2D case [14] we conclude
that in this case the alpha-model does an excellent job repro-
ducing the statistical properties of the large-scale spectra, but

small-scale detailed phase information (such as the location of
structures) is lost.

The reason for the striking agreement between the α-model
and DNS exhibited in Fig. 5, as contrasted with the disagree-
ment shown later in Fig. 10 is that in the case of selective
decay, both computations have found the same ﬁnal state: the
isotropic, maximum-helicity, k = 1 state. This state is the
“ABC ﬂow” with A, B, and C all equal.

V.

INVERSE CASCADES

Inverse cascades of magnetic helicity, driven mechanically
at the small scales, have long been known to be an efﬁcient
dynamo mechanism for generating large-scale magnetic ﬁelds
[28]. Here, we try a different approach: we drive the magnetic
ﬁeld directly at small scales with a random forcing function
that is a superposition of “ABC” ﬂows [see Eq. (20)] between
wavenumbers k = 8 and 9, and with no driving for the ve-
locity. The randomness is introduced by randomly changing
the phases in the trigonometric arguments of each ABC com-
ponent with a correlation time of ∆t = 1.25 × 10−2 (in all
the simulations we discuss in this section, the time step is
2.5 × 10−3). A tiny seed velocity ﬁeld is ampliﬁed some-

what, but the kinetic energy always remains well below the
level of the magnetic energy throughout. We again exhibit the
results of a 2563 DNS computation, and α-model computa-
tions with α = 1/20 and 1/10, with resolutions of 1283 and
643 respectively.

Figs. 11 show the time histories of the energies (a) and
magnetic helicities (b) for the three runs. The rather abrupt
phase jumps in the ABC ﬂows give the lines a jagged appear-
ance and it is sometimes difﬁcult to identify which of the three
runs is which. Sufﬁce it to say that the two α-model runs ex-
hibit the same features as the DNS runs, but with a time lag
that is greater for the larger α. This is visible more clearly
in Fig. 12, where the magnetic helicity spectra for the three
simulations are plotted as functions of k. The curves are the
helicity spectra as functions of time. The lower levels of ex-
citation are associated with earlier times. The times exhibited
range from t = 30 to t = 72.5. The peak, once established,
moves to the left with nearly the same speed in each case. The
suppression of small scales, where the unsmoothed ABC ﬂow
is also unstable, may be responsible for the time lag. This
time-lagged behavior is reminiscent of what happened in two
dimensions with the inverse cascade of mean square vector
potential [14]. However, note that in three dimensions once
the inverse cascade has been established, the growth rate of
magnetic helicity is well captured by the alpha-model (Fig.
11.b), indicative of a more local cascade (in scale). The power
laws present in the spectra of magnetic helicity, and kinetic
and magnetic energy [25] are also well captured by the alpha-
model.

dynamic alignment runs (labels are as in Fig. 6), at t = 4.5. Vertical

VI. THE DYNAMO

The mechanically-driven dynamo, in which injected me-
chanical energy is converted to magnetic energy at large
scales, has long been a recurrent problem in MHD [27]. Here
we are able to show that the alpha model yields the same re-
sults within acceptable accuracy as those of a DNS of the same
situation (see Ref. [15] for another case of recent interest).

We begin with a velocity ﬁeld which is again forced ex-
ternally with the “ABC” geometry of Eq. (20). We choose
A = 0.9, B = 1.0, and C = 1.1, k0 = 3, with η =
ν = 0.002. This choice is governed by the knowledge that
the A = B = C ﬂow gives the largest dynamo growth rate
[29] but it is hydrodynamically very stable [30]; breaking that
symmetry allows for turbulence to develop faster [31].

The force is allowed to operate until a statistically-steady

7

FIG. 9: (a) Kinetic and (b) magnetic energy spectra, for the three

turbulent Navier-Stokes ﬂow prevails. Then a magnetic seed
ﬁeld is introduced at a very low level in the modes from k = 1
to k = 10. As in some other sections, we compare a DNS
run at resolution 2563 with two α-model runs, one with α =
1/20 and 1283 resolution, the other with α = 1/10 and 643
resolution.

Before embarking on the MHD comparison between DNS
and alpha-model results, it is instructive to compare the hydro-
dynamic properties of the ﬂow. When the small magnetic seed
is introduced, the Lorentz force in the Navier-Stokes equation
can be neglected. The induction equation is linear in the mag-
netic ﬁeld, and as a result, the geometrical properties of the
ﬂow are responsible for the observed ampliﬁcation.

The ﬂow generated by the external ABC force is helical.
Previous studies of the alpha-model behavior in simulations
of hydrodynamic ﬂows were carried for non-helical ﬂows
[6, 13]. As a result, here we will focus only on the charac-
terization of the ﬂow helicity. The amount of helicity in a

ﬂow (both for DNS and the alpha-model [7]) is measured by
the kinetic helicity

HK =

v · ω d3

x .

(23)

It is also useful to normalize this quantity introducing the rela-
tive helicity 2HK/(h|v|i h|ω|i). Fig. 13 shows the probability
distribution function (pdf) of relative kinetic helicity for the
DNS and alpha-model simulations. A stronger positive tail
can be identiﬁed in all cases, giving rise to a net positive ki-
netic helicity in the ﬂow.

In 3D hydrodynamic turbulence, kinetic helicity is an ideal
invariant and is known to cascade to smaller scales [32, 33].

magnetic helicity to large scales as time evolves.

Fig. 14 shows the spectrum of HK during the hydrodynamic
simulation. As with the energy, the alpha-model is able to
capture the evolution of kinetic helicity in Fourier space up
to k ∼ α−1. It seems that a Kolmogorov spectrum results
for helicity [34, 35], which implies that the relative helicity is
weaker at small scales.

The early stages of the growth of the magnetic ﬁeld are in
the “kinematic dynamo” parameter regime, involving expo-
nential growth of the magnetic energy. This is shown in Fig.
15, which exhibits both the kinetic and magnetic energy as
functions of time for the three runs. Though the three ener-
gies as functions of time are offset, it is clear that the linear
growth rates are close. At about t = 30, there is a saturation,
close to a state in which on the average the energy is equipar-
titioned approximately between kinetic and magnetic. After

that, there are no signiﬁcant variations in the evolution of the
total kinetic and magnetic energy.

Figs. 16 and 17.a,b show the negative of the magnetic he-
licity, the mean square vector potential, and the mean square
current density as functions of time. Though the agreements
are not sharp, it is clear that the saturation levels and the times
of saturation are both well approximated. Note that, in ac-
cord with expectations [36], the magnetic helicity acquires a
negative value, opposite to the sign of the injected mechanical
helicity. Note also that growth rates of both small scales (rep-
resented by the square current) and large scales (represented
by the square vector potential) are well approximated by the
alpha model during the kinematic regime.

While at t ≈ 30 saturation in the exponential growth of
magnetic energy takes place, the large scale modes continue
growing, and at the end the magnetic ﬁeld is dominated by

stant after t = 30, the squared vector potential keeps growing
slowly. This behavior is even clearer in the evolution of the
magnetic energy spectrum.

spectra. The thick lines indicate kinetic spectra and the thin
lines the magnetic spectra. The vertical lines indicate the lo-
cations of the two values of α−1. In Fig. 18.a, the upper traces
are the DNS spectrum at the time the seed ﬁeld begins to grow,
both for DNS and α-model simulations. The lower traces in
Fig. 18.a show the magnetic spectrum at an early stage of
its evolution. During this stage, the magnetic energy spec-
trum peaks at small scales, and the α-model correctly captures
the overall shape of the spectrum as well as the scale where

the magnetic energy peaks. In the kinematic regime, all the
magnetic k-shells in Fourier space (up to k . 12) grow with
the same rate, and this feature is also well captured by the
α-model simulations (not shown). This evolution is charac-
teristic of small scale dynamos, as well as a k3/2 slope in the
magnetic energy spectrum at early times [36, 37]. Fig. 18.b
shows the late-time spectra, when approximate equipartition
has been achieved. Note that as a result of helical dynamo ac-
tion, a magnetic ﬁeld at large scales (k = 1) is generated (see
Fig. 18.b). The amplitude of this mode is in good agreement
for both DNS and α-model simulations.

Figure 19 shows surfaces of constant magnetic energy at
t = 60, when the nonlinear saturation has already taken place

but the large scale magnetic ﬁeld is still growing. Thin and
elongated structures can be identiﬁed in the magnetic ﬁeld
growing in the DNS. However, note that while these structures
are present both in the DNS and in the alpha-model, in the lat-
ter case the structures are thicker. This change is related to
the ﬁltering length α in the alpha-model. Similar results have
been found in vorticity structures observed in simulations of
hydrodynamic turbulence using the alpha-model [6].

We thus conclude that there are few surprises in the dynamo
simulations, at least for these values of η/ν, and no glaring
departures of the α-model predictions from the DNS results.

VII. SUMMARY; DISCUSSION

FIG. 18: (color online) Kinetic (thick blue lines), and magnetic en-
ergy spectra (thin lines), at (a) t = 6 and (b) t = 70. Kolmogorov’s
−5/3 and Kazantsev’s k3/2 spectra are shown as a reference. The
k
−1 = 10
vertical dotted and dashed lines correspond to the scales α
and 20 respectively. Labels are as in Fig. 13.

Within the framework of rectangular periodic boundary
conditions, we have examined four familiar three-dimensional
MHD turbulence effects via the α-model and DNS. In every
case, the principal large-scale features of these phenomena
have been achieved with the α-model to acceptable accuracy.
The savings in computer time achieved by the α-model runs
have ranged from 2563/1283 = 8 to 2563/643 = 64, with-
out considering extra saving in the time step from the CFL
condition as the resolution is decreased. In no case has the
α-model yielded results at signiﬁcant variance with the DNS
runs, which have been regarded as accurate.

Other features of the DNS runs, such as the probability dis-
tribution functions of the ﬂuctuating quantities (such as local
energy dissipation rates), have also been reproduced by the α-

model as they were in two dimensions [14], but we have not
shown those results here because they are so similar to what
was found in two dimensions.

In Ref. [14] also the errors of the α-model computations
were compared against under-resolved DNS. The behavior of
the α-model in three dimensions is comparable to our previ-
ous results, and therefore we refer the reader to our previous
work for a detailed discussion about this topic.

In conclusion, the MHD α-model can be considered to be
validated, at least for the behavior of long-wavelength spectra
in periodic boundary conditions.
Its implementation in the
presence of material boundaries stands as a next forbidding
challenge.

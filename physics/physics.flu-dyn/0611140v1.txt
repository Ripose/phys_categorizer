Abstract

The modeling of tsunami generation is an essential phase in un-
derstanding tsunamis. For tsunamis generated by underwater earth-
quakes, it involves the modeling of the sea bottom motion as well as
the resulting motion of the water above it. A comparison between var-
ious models for three-dimensional water motion, ranging from linear
theory to fully nonlinear theory, is performed. It is found that for most
events the linear theory is suﬃcient. However, in some cases, more so-
phisticated theories are needed. Moreover, it is shown that the passive
approach in which the seaﬂoor deformation is simply translated to the
ocean surface is not always equivalent to the active approach in which
the bottom motion is taken into account, even if the deformation is
supposed to be instantaneous.

1 Introduction

Tsunami wave modeling is a challenging task. In particular, it is essential
to understand the ﬁrst minutes of a tsunami, its propagation and ﬁnally
the resulting inundation and impact on structures. The focus of the present
paper is on the generation process. There are diﬀerent natural phenomena
that can lead to a tsunami. For example, one can mention submarine mass
failures, slides, volcanic eruptions, falls of asteroids, etc. We refer to the
review on tsunami science recently given by Synolakis and Bernard [2006] for
a complete bibliography on the topic. The present work focuses on tsunami
generation by earthquakes.

Two steps in modeling are necessary for an accurate description of tsunami
generation: a model for the earthquake fed by the various seismic parameters,
and a model for the formation of surface gravity waves resulting from the de-
formation of the seaﬂoor. In the absence of sophisticated source models, one
often uses analytical solutions based on dislocation theory in an elastic half-
space for the seaﬂoor displacement [Okada, 1985]. For the resulting water
motion, the standard practice is to transfer the inferred seaﬂoor displacement
to the free surface of the ocean. In this paper, we will call this approach the
passive generation approach. This approach leads to a well-posed initial
value problem with zero velocity. An open question for tsunami forecast-
ing modelers is the validity of neglecting the initial velocity.
In a recent
note, Dutykh et al. [2006] used linear theory to show that indeed diﬀerences
may exist between the standard passive generation and the active generation
that takes into account the dynamics of seaﬂoor displacement. The transient
wave generation due to the coupling between the seaﬂoor motion and the
free surface has been considered by a few authors only. One of the reasons
is that it is commonly assumed that the source details are not important.1

1As pointed out by Geist et al. [2006], the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami shed some doubts
about this belief. The measurements from land based stations that use the Global Posi-

Ben-Menahem and Rosenman [1972] calculated the two-dimensional radia-
tion pattern from a moving source (linear theory). Tuck and Hwang [1972]
solved the linear long-wave equation in the presence of a moving bottom
and a uniformly sloping beach. Hammack [1973] generated waves experi-
mentally by raising or lowering a box at one end of a channel. According
to Synolakis and Bernard [2006], Houston and Garcia [1974] were the ﬁrst to
use more geophysically realistic initial conditions. For obvious reasons, the
quantitative diﬀerences in the distribution of seaﬂoor displacement due to
underwater earthquakes compared with more conventional earthquakes are
still poorly known. Villeneuve and Savage [1993] derived model equations
which combine the linear eﬀect of frequency dispersion and the nonlinear
eﬀect of amplitude dispersion, and included the eﬀects of a moving bed.
Todorovska and Trifunac [2001] considered the generation of tsunamis by a
slowly spreading uplift of the seaﬂoor.

In this paper, we mostly follow the standard passive generation approach.
Several tsunami generation models and numerical methods suited for these
models are presented and compared. The focus of our work is on modelling
the ﬂuid motion. It is assumed that the seabed deformation satisﬁes all the
necessary hypotheses required to apply Okada’s solution. The main objective
is to conﬁrm or inﬁrm the lack of importance of nonlinear eﬀects and/or fre-
quency dispersion in tsunami generation. This result may have implications
in terms of computational cost. The goal is to optimize the ratio between
the complexity of the model and the accuracy of the results. Government
agencies need to compute accurately tsunami propagation in real time in
order to know where to evacuate people. Therefore any saving in computa-
tional time is crucial (see for example the code MOST used by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US [Titov and Synolakis,
1998]). Liu and Liggett [1983] already performed comparisons between lin-
ear and nonlinear water waves but their study was restricted to simple bottom
deformations, namely the generation of transient waves by an upthrust of a
rectangular block, and the nonlinear computations were restricted to two-
dimensional ﬂows. Bona et al. [1981] assessed how well a model equation
with weak nonlinearity and dispersion describes the propagation of surface
water waves generated at one end of a long channel. In their experiments,
they found that the inclusion of a dissipative term was more important than
the inclusion of nonlinearity, although the inclusion of nonlinearity was un-
doubtedly beneﬁcial in describing the observations. The importance of dis-

tioning System to track ground movements revealed that the fault continued to slip after it
stopped releasing seismic energy. Even though this slip was relatively slow, it contributed
to the tsunami and may explain the surprising tsunami heights.

persive eﬀects in tsunami propagation is not directly addressed in the present
paper. Indeed these eﬀects cannot be measured without taking into account
the duration (or distance) of tsunami propagation [Tuck, 1979].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the equations
that are commonly used for water-wave propagation, namely the fully non-
linear potential ﬂow (FNPF) equations. Section 3 provides a description of
the linear theory, with explicit expressions for the free-surface elevation and
the velocities everywhere inside the ﬂuid domain, both for active and pas-
sive generations. Section 4 is devoted to the nonlinear shallow water (NSW)
equations and their numerical integration by a ﬁnite volume scheme. In Sec-
tion 5 we brieﬂy describe the boundary element numerical method used to
integrate the FNPF equations. The following section (Section 6) is devoted
to comparisons between the various models and a discussion on the results.
The main conclusion is that linear theory is suﬃcient in general but that
passive generation overestimates the initial transient waves in some cases.
Finally directions for future research are outlined.

2 Physical problem description

In the whole paper, the vertical coordinate is denoted by z, while the two
horizontal coordinates are denoted by x and y, respectively. The sea bottom
deformation following an underwater earthquake is a complex phenomenon.
This is why, for theoretical or experimental studies, researchers have often
used simpliﬁed bottom motions such as the vertical motion of a box. In order
to determine the deformations of the sea bottom due to an earthquake, we
use the analytical solution obtained by Okada [1985] for a dislocation in an
elastic half-space. This solution, which at present time is used by the ma-
jority of tsunami wave modelers to produce an initial condition for tsunami
propagation simulations, provides an explicit expression of the bottom sur-
face deformation that depends on a dozen of source parameters such as the
dip angle δ, fault depth df , fault dimensions (length and width), Burger’s
vector D, Young’s modulus, Poisson ratio, etc. Some of these parameters
are shown in ﬁgure 1. More details can be found in Dutykh and Dias [2006]
for example. A value of 90◦ for the dip angle corresponds to a vertical fault.
Varying the fault slip
does not change the co-seismic deformation pat-
tern, only its magnitude. The values of the parameters used in the present
paper are given in Table 1. A typical dip-slip solution is shown in ﬁgure 2
(the angle φ is equal to 0, while the rake angle θ is equal to π/2).

a dispersive train of oscillatory waves, regardless of the exact structure of

can be extended to two-dimensional bi-directional waves.

(δ = 167◦). The seaﬂoor deformation occurs instantaneously at t = 0. The
water depth h(x, y) is assumed to be constant.

in the initial data (which corresponds to a typical Okada solution for a nor-
mal fault), solitons can evolve and we have checked this last result using the
FNPF equations (see ﬁgure 4). In this study, we focus on the case where V
is positive with a dip angle δ equal to 13◦, according to the seismic data of
the 26 December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman event (see for example Lay et al.
[2005]). However, the sea bottom deformation often has an N
shape, with
subsidence on one side of the fault and uplift on the other side as shown
in ﬁgure 2. In that case, one may expect the positive V behaviour on one
side and the negative V behaviour on the other side. Recall that the exper-
iments of Hammack and Segur [1974] were performed in the presence of a
vertical wall next to the moving bottom and their analysis was based on the
uni-directional KdV wave equation.

Before the earthquake the ﬂuid is assumed to be at rest, thus the free surface
and the solid boundary are deﬁned by z = 0 and z =
h(x, y), respectively.
For simplicity h(x, y) is assumed to be a constant. Of course, in real situa-
tions, this is never the case but for our purpose the bottom bathymetry is not
important. Starting at time t = 0, the solid boundary moves in a prescribed
manner which is given by

The deformation of the sea bottom is assumed to have all the necessary
properties needed to compute its Fourier transform in x, y and its Laplace
transform in t. The resulting deformation of the free surface z = η(x, y, t)
is to be found as part of the solution. It is also assumed that the ﬂuid is
incompressible and the ﬂow irrotational. The latter implies the existence
of a velocity potential φ(x, y, z, t) which completely describes the ﬂow. By
deﬁnition of φ the ﬂuid velocity vector can be expressed as q =

where two dimensionless numbers have been introduced:

ε = a/d, µ = d/λ.

For the propagation of tsunamis, both numbers ε and µ are small. Indeed
the satellite altimetry observations of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami waves
obtained by two satellites that passed over the Indian Ocean a couple of
hours after the rupture process occurred gave an amplitude a of roughly 60
cm in the open ocean. The typical wavelength estimated from the width of
the segments that experienced slip is between 160 and 240 km [Lay et al.,
2005]. The water depth ranges from 4 km towards the west of the rupture
to 1 km towards the east. Therefore average values for ε and µ in the open

The water-wave problem, either in the form of an initial value problem
(IVP) or in the form of a boundary value problem (BVP), is diﬃcult to solve
because of the nonlinearities in the boundary conditions and the unknown
computational domain.

3 Linear theory

First we perform the linearization of the above equations and boundary con-
ditions. It is equivalent to taking the limit of (3)–(6) as ε
0. The linearized
problem can also be obtained by expanding the unknown functions as power
series of the small parameter ε. Collecting terms of the lowest order in ε yields
the linear approximation. For the sake of convenience, we now switch back
to the physical variables. The linearized problem in dimensional variables

(13)

Most studies of tsunami generation assume that the initial free-surface de-
formation is equal to the vertical displacement of the ocean bottom and take
a zero velocity ﬁeld as initial condition. The details of wave motion are com-
pletely neglected during the time that the source operates. While tsunami
modelers often justify this assumption by the fact that the earthquake rup-
ture occurs very rapidly, there are some speciﬁc cases where the time scale
and/or the horizontal extent of the bottom deformation may become an im-
portant factor. This was emphasized for example by Todorovska and Trifunac
[2001] and Todorovska et al. [2002], who considered the generation of tsunamis
by a slowly spreading uplift of the seaﬂoor in order to explain some obser-
vations related to past tsunamis. However they did not use realistic source
models.

Our claim is that it is important to make a distinction between two mech-
anisms of generation: an active mechanism in which the bottom moves ac-
cording to a given time law and a passive mechanism in which the seaﬂoor
deformation is simply translated to the free surface. Recently Dutykh et al.
[2006] showed that even in the case of an instantaneous seaﬂoor deformation,
there may be diﬀerences between these two generation processes.

3.1 Active generation

Since in this case the system is assumed to be at rest at t = 0, the initial
condition simply is

η(x, y, 0)

0.

≡

(14)

In fact, η(x, y, t) = 0 for all times t < 0 and the same condition holds for the
velocities. For t < 0, the water is at rest and the bottom motion is such that
ζ(x, y, t) = 0 for t < 0.

The problem (9)–(13) can be solved by using the method of integral trans-

forms. We apply the Fourier transform in (x, y),

f (x, y)e−i(kx+ℓy) dxdy,

(19)

where m = √k2 + ℓ2. The functions A(k, ℓ, s) and B(k, ℓ, s) can be easily

In some applications it is important to know not only the free-surface
elevation but also the velocity ﬁeld inside the ﬂuid domain. In the present
study we consider seabed deformations with the structure

ζ(x, y, t) := ζ0(x, y)T (t).

(23)

Mathematically we separate the time dependence from the spatial coordi-
nates. There are two main reasons for doing this. First of all we want to
be able to invert analytically the Laplace transform. The second reason is
more fundamental. In fact, dynamic source models are not easily available.
Okada’s solution, which was brieﬂy described in the previous section, pro-
vides the static sea-bed deformation ζ0(x, y). Hammack [1973] considered
two types of time histories: an exponential and a half-sine bed movements.
Dutykh and Dias [2006] considered two additional time histories: a linear and
an instantaneous bed movements. We show below that taking an instanta-
neous seabed deformation (in that case the function T (t) is the Heaviside
step function) is not equivalent to instantaneously transferring the seabed
deformation to the ocean surface3.

In equation (21), we obtained the Fourier–Laplace transform of the ve-

Let us evaluate the velocity ﬁeld at an arbitrary level z = βh with
≤
0. In the linear approximation the value β = 0 corresponds to the free surface
while β =
1 corresponds to the bottom. Below the horizontal velocities are
denoted by u and the horizontal gradient (∂/∂x, ∂/∂y) is denoted by
∇h. The
vertical velocity component is simply w. The Fourier transform parameters
are denoted by k = (k, ℓ).

At time t = 0, there is a singularity that can be incorporated in the above
expressions. For simplicity, we only consider the expressions for t > 0.

Since tsunameters have one component that measures the pressure at the
bottom (see for example Gonz´alez et al. [2005]), it is interesting to provide
as well the expression pb(x, y, t) for the pressure at the bottom. The pressure
p(x, y, z, t) can be obtained from Bernoulli’s equation, which was written
explicitly for the free surface in equation (2), but is valid everywhere in the
ﬂuid:

The main diﬀerences between passive and active generation processes
are that (i) the wave amplitudes and velocities obtained with the instantly
moving bottom are lower than those generated by initial translation of the
bottom motion and that (ii) the water column plays the role of a low-pass
ﬁlter (compare equations (25)–(27) with equations (39)–(41)). High frequen-
cies are attenuated in the moving bottom solution. Ward [2001], who studied
landslide tsunamis, also commented on the 1/ cosh(mh) term, which low-pass
ﬁlters the source spectrum. So the ﬁlter favors long waves. In the discussion
section, we will come back to the diﬀerences between passive generation and
active generation.

3.3 Linear numerical method

All the expressions derived from linear theory are explicit but they must
be computed numerically. It is not a trivial task because of the oscillatory

4 Nonlinear shallow water equations

20

behaviour of the integrand functions. All integrals were computed with Filon
type numerical integration formulas (see Filon [1928]), which explicitly take
into account this oscillatory behaviour. Numerical results will be shown in
Section 6.

4 Nonlinear shallow water equations

Synolakis and Bernard [2006] introduced a clear distinction between the var-
ious shallow-water models. At the lowest order of approximation, one obtains
the linear shallow water wave equation. The next level of approximation pro-
vides the nondispersive nonlinear shallow water equations (NSW). In the next
level, dispersive terms are added and the resulting equations constitute the
Boussinesq equations. Since there are many diﬀerent ways to go to this level
of approximation, there are a lot of diﬀerent types of Boussinesq equations.
The NSW equations are the most commonly used equations for tsunami
propagation (see in particular the code MOST developed by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the US [Titov and Synolakis,
1998]). They are also used for generation and runup/inundation. Our analy-
sis will focus on the NSW equations. For simplicity, we assume below that h
is constant. Therefore one can take h as reference depth, so that the seaﬂoor
is given by z =

1 + εζ.

−

4.1 Mathematical model

In this subsection, partial derivatives are denoted by subscripts. When µ2
is a small parameter, the water is considered to be shallow. For the shallow
water theory, one formally expands the potential φ in powers of µ2:

φ = φ0 + µ2φ1 + µ4φ2 +

.

· · ·

This expansion is substituted into the governing equation and the boundary
conditions. The lowest-order term in Laplace’s equation is

φ0zz = 0.

(42)

The boundary conditions imply that φ0 = φ0(x, y, t). Thus the vertical
velocity component is zero and the horizontal velocity components are inde-
pendent of the vertical coordinate z at lowest order. Let us introduce the
notation u := φ0x(x, y, t) and v := φ0y(x, y, t). Solving Laplace’s equation
and taking into account the bottom kinematic condition yield the following

The next step consists in retaining terms of requested order in the free-

in the kinematic boundary condition (4), one obtains

Kulikov et al. [2005] have argued that the satellite altimetry observations of
the Indian Ocean tsunami show some dispersive eﬀects. However the steep-
ness is so small that the origin of these eﬀects is questionable. Guesmia et al.
[1998] compared Boussinesq and shallow-water models and came to the con-
clusion that the eﬀects of frequency dispersion are minor. As Kˆanoglu and Synolakis
[2006] pointed out, dispersive eﬀects are necessary only when examining steep
gravity waves, which are not encountered in the context of tsunami hydro-
dynamics in deep water. However they can be encountered in experiments
such as those of Hammack [1973] because the parameter µ is much bigger.

4.2 Numerical method

In order to solve the NSW equations, a ﬁnite-volume approach is used. For
example LeVeque [1998] used a high-order ﬁnite volume scheme to solve a

system of NSW equations. Here the ﬂux scheme we use is the characteristic
ﬂux scheme, which was introduced by Ghidaglia et al. [1996]. This numerical
method satisﬁes the conservative properties at the discrete level. The NSW
equations (51)–(53) can be rewritten in the following conservative form:

The scheme we use is multi-dimensional by construction and does not

description of the numerical method, we assume that there is no y-variation
and no source term S. Let us then consider a system of m–conservation laws

5 Numerical method for the full equations

The fully nonlinear potential ﬂow (FNPF) equations (3)–(6) are solved by
using a numerical model based on the Boundary Element Method (BEM).
An accurate code was developed by Grilli et al. [2001]. It uses a high-order
three-dimensional boundary element method combined with mixed Eulerian–
Lagrangian time updating, based on second-order explicit Taylor expansions
with adaptive time steps. The eﬃciency of the code was recently greatly
improved by introducing a more eﬃcient spatial solver, based on the fast
multipole algorithm [Fochesato and Dias, 2006]. By replacing every matrix–
vector product of the iterative solver and avoiding the building of the inﬂu-
ence matrix, this algorithm reduces the computing complexity from O(N 2)
to nearly O(N) up to logarithms, where N is the number of nodes on the
boundary.

By using Green’s second identity, Laplace’s equation (1) is transformed

into the boundary integral equation

where G is the three-dimensional free space Green’s function. The notation

∂G/∂n means the normal derivative, that is ∂G/∂n =
unit outward normal vector. The vectors x = (x, y, z) and xl = (xl, yl, zl) are
position vectors for points on the boundary, and α(xl) = θl/(4π) is a geomet-
ric coeﬃcient, with θl the exterior solid angle made by the boundary at point
xl. The boundary Γ is divided into various parts with diﬀerent boundary
conditions. On the free surface, one rewrites the nonlinear kinematic and
dynamic boundary conditions in a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian form,

with R the position vector of a free-surface ﬂuid particle. The material
derivative is deﬁned as

For time integration, second-order explicit Taylor series expansions are
used to ﬁnd the new position and the potential on the free surface at time
t + ∆t. This time stepping scheme presents the advantage of being explicit,
and the use of spatial derivatives along the free surface provides a better
stability of the computed solution.

The integral equations are solved by BEM. The boundary is discretized
into N collocation nodes and M high-order elements are used to interpolate
between these nodes. Within each element, the boundary geometry and
the ﬁeld variables are discretized using polynomial shape functions. The
integrals on the boundary are converted into a sum on the elements, each
one being calculated on the reference element. The matrices are built with
the numerical computation of the integrals on the reference element. The
linear systems resulting from the two boundary integral equations (one for
the pair (φ, ∂φ/∂n) and one for the pair (∂φ/∂t, ∂2φ/∂t∂n)) are full and non
symmetric. Assembling the matrix as well as performing the integrations
accurately are time consuming tasks. They are done only once at each time
step, since the same matrix is used for both systems. Solving the linear
system is another time consuming task. Even with the GMRES algorithm
with preconditioning, the computational complexity is O(N 2), which is the
same as the complexity of the assembling phase. The introduction of the fast
multipole algorithm reduces considerably the complexity of the problem. The
matrix is no longer built. Far away nodes are placed in groups, so less time
is spent in numerical integrations and memory requirements are reduced.
The hierarchical structure involved in the algorithm gives automatically the
distance criteria for adaptive integrations.

6 Comparisons and discussion

Grilli et al. [2002] used the earlier version of the code to study tsunami
generation by underwater landslides. They included the bottom motion due
to the landslide. For the comparisons shown below, we only used the passive
approach: we did not include the dynamics of the bottom motion.

6 Comparisons and discussion

The passive generation approach is followed for the numerical comparisons
between the three models: (i) linear equations, (ii) NSW equations and (iii)
fully nonlinear equations. As shown in Section 3, this generation process gives
the largest transient-wave amplitudes for a given permanent deformation of
the seaﬂoor. Therefore it is in some sense a worst case scenario.

The small dimensionless numbers ε and µ2 introduced in (7) represent
the magnitude of the nonlinear terms and dispersive terms in the governing
equations, respectively. Hence, the relative importance of the nonlinear and
the dispersive eﬀects is given by the parameter

S =

which is called the Stokes (or Ursell) number [Ursell, 1953]. An important
assumption in the derivation of the Boussinesq system (54)–(56) is that the
Stokes number is O(1). Here, the symbol O(
) is used informally in the way
that is common in the construction and formal analysis of model equations
for physical phenomena. We are concerned with the limits ε
0.
Thus, S = O(1) means that, as ε
0, S takes values that are
neither very large nor very small. We emphasize here that the Ursell number
does not convey any information by itself about the separate negligibility
of nonlinear and frequency dispersion eﬀects. Another important aspect of
models is the time scale of their validity. In the NSW equations, terms of
order O(ǫ2) and O(µ2) have been neglected. Therefore one expects these
terms to make an order-one relative contribution on a time scale of order
min(ε−2, µ−2).

in both directions, with a leading wave of depression to the left and a lead-
ing wave of elevation to the right, in qualitative agreement with the satellite
and tide gauge measurements of the 2004 Sumatra event. When tsunamis
are generated along subduction zones, they usually split in two; one moves
quickly inland while the second heads toward the open ocean. The three
models are almost undistinguishable at all times: the waves propagate with
the same speed and the same proﬁle. Nonlinear eﬀects and dispersive eﬀects
are clearly negligible during the ﬁrst moments of transient waves generated
by a moving bottom, at least for these particular choices of ε and µ.

Let us now decrease the Stokes number by increasing the water depth.

Let us introduce several sensors (tide gauges) at selected locations which
are representative of the initial deformation of the free surface (see ﬁgure 8).
One can study the evolution of the surface elevation during the generation
time at each gauge. Figure 9 shows free-surface elevations corresponding to
the linear and nonlinear shallow water models. They are plotted on the same
graph for comparison purposes. Again there is a slight diﬀerence between
the linear and the NSW models, but dispersion eﬀects are still small.

Let us decrease the Stokes number even further by increasing the water
depth. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate the evolution of transient water waves

6, except for the water depth now equal to 1 km. The small dimensionless
10−5 and µ = 0.1, with a corresponding Stokes
numbers are roughly ε = 5
number equal to 0.005. On one hand, linear and fully nonlinear models are es-
sentially undistinguishable at all times: the waves propagate with the same
speed and the same proﬁle. Nonlinear eﬀects are clearly negligible during
the ﬁrst moments of transient waves generated by a moving bottom, at least
in this context. On the other hand, the numerical solution obtained with
the NSW model gives slightly diﬀerent results. Waves computed with this
model do not propagate with the same speed and have diﬀerent amplitudes
compared to those obtained with the linear and fully nonlinear models. Dis-
persive eﬀects come into the picture essentially because the waves are shorter
compared to the water depth. As shown in the previous examples, dispersive
eﬀects do not play a role for long enough waves.

Figure 12 shows the transient waves at the gauges selected in ﬁgure 8. One
can see that the elevations obtained with the linear and fully nonlinear models
are very close within graphical accuracy. On the contrary, the nonlinear
shallow water model leads to a higher speed and the diﬀerence is obvious for
the points away from the generation zone.

These results show that one cannot neglect the dispersive eﬀects any
longer. The NSW equations, which contain no dispersive eﬀects, lead to
diﬀerent speed and amplitudes. Moreover, the oscillatory behaviour just be-
hind the two front waves is no longer present. This oscillatory behaviour
has been observed for the water waves computed with the linear and fully
nonlinear models and is due to the presence of frequency dispersion. So, one
should replace the NSW equations with Boussinesq models which combine
the two fundamentals eﬀects of nonlinearity and dispersion. Wei et al. [1995]
provided comparisons for two-dimensional waves resulting from the integra-
tion of a Boussinesq model and the two-dimensional version of the FNPF
model described above.
In fact they used a fully nonlinear variant of the
Boussinesq model, which predicts wave heights, phase speeds and particle
kinematics more accurately than the standard weakly nonlinear approxima-
tion ﬁrst derived by Peregrine [1967] and improved by Nwogu’s modiﬁed
Boussinesq model [Nwogu, 1993].

From a physical point of view, we emphasize that the wavelength of the
tsunami waves is directly related to the mechanism of generation and to the
dimensions of the source event. And so is the dimensionless number µ which
determines the importance of the dispersive eﬀects. In general it will remain
small.

Adapting the discussion by Bona et al. [2005], one can expect the solu-
tions to the long wave models to be good approximations of the solutions
to the full water-wave equations on a time scale of the order min(ε−1, µ−2)

and also the neglected eﬀects to make an order-one relative contribution on
a time scale of order min(ε−2, µ−4, ε−1µ−2). Even though we have not com-
puted precisely the constant in front of these estimates, the results shown in
this paper are in agreement with these estimates. Considering the 2004 Box-
ing Day tsunami, it is clear that dispersive and nonlinear eﬀects did not have
suﬃcient time to develop during the ﬁrst hours due to the extreme smallness
of ε and µ2, except of course when the tsunami waves approached the coast.
Let us conclude this section with a discussion on the generation meth-
ods, which extends the results given by Dutykh et al. [2006] 4. We show
the major diﬀerences between the classical passive approach and the active
approach of wave generation by a moving bottom. Recall that the classical
approach consists in translating the sea bed deformation to the free surface
and letting it propagate. Results are presented for waves computed with the
linear model.

Figure 13 shows the waves measured at several artiﬁcial gauges. The
parameters are those of Table 1, and the water depth is h = 500 m. The
solid line represents the solution with an instantaneous bottom deformation
while the dashed line represents the passive wave generation scenario. Both
scenarios give roughly the same wave proﬁles. Let us now consider a slightly
diﬀerent set of parameters: the only diﬀerence is the water depth which is
now h = 1 km. As shown in ﬁgure 14, the two generation models diﬀer. The
passive mechanism gives higher wave amplitudes.

Let us quantify this diﬀerence by considering the relative diﬀerence be-

tween the two mechanisms deﬁned by

r(x, y, t) = |

ηactive(x, y, t)

ηpassive(x, y, t)

|

.

−
ηactive||

∞

||
Intuitively this quantity represents the deviation of the passive solution from
the active one with a moving bottom in units of the maximum amplitude of
ηactive(x, y, t).

Results are presented on ﬁgures (15) and (16). The diﬀerences can be
easily explained by looking at the analytical formulas (25) and (39) of Section
3. These diﬀerences, which can be crucial for accurate tsunami modelling,
are twofold.

First of all, the wave amplitudes obtained with the instantly moving bot-
tom are lower than those generated by the passive approach (this statement
follows from the inequality cosh mh
1). The numerical experiments show
≥
that this diﬀerence is about 6% in the ﬁrst case and 20% in the second case.
4In ﬁgures 1 and 2 of Dutykh et al. [2006], a mistake was introduced in the time scale.

All times must be multiplied by a factor √1000.

7 Conclusions

41

The second feature is more subtle. The water column has an eﬀect of
a low-pass ﬁlter.
In other words, if the initial deformation contains high
frequencies, they will be attenuated in the moving bottom solution because
of the presence of the hyperbolic cosine cosh(mh) in the denominator which
grows exponentially with m. Incidently, in the framework of the NSW equa-
tions, there is no diﬀerence between the passive and the active approach for
an instantaneous seabed deformation [Tuck, 1979, Tuck and Hwang, 1972].
If we prescribe a more realistic bottom motion as in Dutykh and Dias
[2006], for example, the results will depend on the characteristic time of the
seabed deformation. When the characteristic time of the bottom motion de-
creases, the linearized solution tends to the instantaneous wave generation
scenario. So, in the framework of linear water wave equations, one cannot
exceed the passive generation amplitude with an active process. However,
during slow events, Todorovska and Trifunac [2001] have shown that ampliﬁ-
cation of one order of magnitude may occur when the sea ﬂoor uplift spreads
with velocity similar to the long wave tsunami velocity.

7 Conclusions

Comparisons between linear and nonlinear models for tsunami generation
by an underwater earthquake have been presented. There are two main
conclusions that are of great importance for modelling the ﬁrst instants of a
tsunami and for providing an eﬃcient initial condition to propagation models.
To begin with, a very good agreement is observed from the superposition of
plots of wave proﬁles computed with the linear and fully nonlinear models.
Secondly, the nonlinear shallow water model was not suﬃcient to model
some of the waves generated by a moving bottom because of the presence
of frequency dispersion. However classical tsunami waves are much longer,
compared to the water depth, than the waves considered in the present paper,
so that the NSW model is also suﬃcient to describe tsunami generation by
a moving bottom. Comparisons between the NSW equations and the FNPF
equations for modeling tsunami run-up are left for future work.

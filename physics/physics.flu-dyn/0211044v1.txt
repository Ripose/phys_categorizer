The streamwise and transverse velocities are measured simultaneously in isotropic grid turbulence
at relatively high Reynolds numbers, Reλ ≃ 110–330. Using a conditional averaging technique, we
extract typical intermittency patterns, which are consistent with velocity proﬁles of a model for
a vortex tube, i.e., Burgers vortex. The radii of the vortex tubes are several of the Kolmogorov
length regardless of the Reynolds number. Using the distribution of an interval between successive
enhancements of a small-scale velocity increment, we study the spatial distribution of vortex tubes.
The vortex tubes tend to cluster together. This tendency is increasingly signiﬁcant with the Reynolds
number. Using statistics of velocity increments, we also study the energetical importance of vortex
tubes as a function of the scale. The vortex tubes are important over the background ﬂow at
small scales especially below the Taylor microscale. At a ﬁxed scale, the importance is increasingly
signiﬁcant with the Reynolds number.

INTRODUCTION

By using direct numerical simulations [1, 2, 3] and bubble/cavitation visualization experiments [4, 5, 6], it has been
established that turbulence contains vortex tubes. Regions of intense vorticity are organized into tubes. Their radii
and lengths are, respectively, of the orders of the Kolmogorov length η and the integral length L. Their lifetimes are
several turnover times of the largest eddies. The vortex tubes occupy a small fraction of the volume and are embedded
in a background ﬂow that is random and of large scales (see also reviews [7, 8, 9]). Here we study vortex tubes in
velocity ﬁelds of experimental turbulence as a function of the Reynolds number Reλ.

Especially when the Reynolds number is high, eﬀects of vortex tubes on the velocity ﬁeld are of interest. The velocity
signal at small scales is enhanced only in a fraction of the volume [10]. This small-scale intermittency is attributable
to vortex tubes [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]. With increasing the Reynolds number, turbulence becomes more intermittent [8].

Large values of the Reynolds number, Reλ ≫ 100, are achieved only in experiments, where a measurement is made
with a probe suspended in the ﬂow and a one-dimensional cut of the velocity ﬁeld is obtained. The measurement
often deals with the velocity component in the mean-ﬂow direction alone (hereafter, the streamwise velocity u), but
the transverse velocity v is more suited to detecting circulation ﬂows such as those associated with vortex tubes
[11, 12, 13]. A simultaneous measurement of the two velocity components is desirable.

For laboratory experiments, there are several possible conﬁgurations. Among them, a ﬂow downstream of a
turbulence-generating grid is preferable. This grid turbulence is isotropic and free from external inﬂuences such
as mean shear, and hence is suited to isolating eﬀects of vortex tubes at each of the scales. Although the Reynolds
number is not very high and the inertial subrange is almost absent, grid turbulence is a natural step from direct
numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence with small Reλ values to laboratory or ﬁeld experiments of anisotropic
turbulence with very large Reλ values.

We carried out simultaneous measurements of the streamwise and transverse velocities in grid turbulence with a
range of the Reynolds number, Reλ ≃ 110–330. Since our wind tunnels as well as our grids were large, the Reλ values
exceed those in past studies of grid turbulence. The exception is a special but old experiment with high air pressure
[14], for which the Reynolds number was in the range Reλ = 260–670. Thus our data provide a unique opportunity to
study vortex tubes in isotropic turbulence with a wide range of the Reynolds number. The preliminary studies had
been reported by Mouri et al. [15], but the present data are new and are analyzed more carefully and extensively.

In Sec. II, we describe our experiments. In Sec. III, we present a model for a vortex tube. In Sec. IV, a conditional
averaging technique is used to extract typical intermittency patterns from the data. The patterns turn out to be
consistent with velocity proﬁles expected for the model tube. Also, statistics of velocity increments are used to study

In Sec. V, we present our conclusion with

II. EXPERIMENTS

The experiments were done in two wind tunnels of Meteorological Research Institute. Their test sections were of
0.8 × 0.8 × 3 and 3 × 2 × 18 m in size. Turbulence was produced by placing a grid across the entrance to the test
section. The grid consisted of two layers of uniformly spaced rods, the axes of which were perpendicular to each other.
We used three grids. The separations of the axes of their adjacent rods were M = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 m. The cross
sections of the rods were, respectively, 0.02 × 0.02, 0.04 × 0.04, and 0.06 × 0.06 m. The mean wind was set to be U
≃ 4, 8, 12, or 16 m s−1.

The streamwise (U + u) and transverse (v) velocities were measured simultaneously with a hot-wire anemometer.
The anemometer was composed of a crossed-wire probe and a constant temperature system. The probe was positioned
on the tunnel axis. The hot wires were platinum-coated tungsten ﬁlaments, 5 µm in diameter, 1.25 mm in eﬀective
length, 1 mm in separation, 280◦C in temperature, and oriented at ±45◦ to the mean-ﬂow direction. The calibration
was done before and after each of the measurements.

The signal was low-pass ﬁltered at fc = 4–16 kHz with 24 dB per octave and sampled digitally at fs = 8–32 kHz
with 16-bit resolution. To avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency was set to be twice of the ﬁlter cutoﬀ frequency,
fs = 2fc. The entire length of the signal was 2 × 107 points, which is large enough to guarantee the convergence of
the statistics [16, 17].

For each set of the grid and the mean wind speed, measurements were made at several positions downstream of
the grid. We ﬁrst computed the ﬂatness factors hu4i/hu2i2 and hv4i/hv2i2, where h·i denotes an average. The data
with the ﬂatness factors being close to the Gaussian value of 3 were used in further analyses because we are to study
fully developed turbulence. If the measurement position is too close to or far from the grid, the turbulence is still
developing or already decaying, and its ﬂatness factors are diﬀerent from the Gaussian value [18]. Except for the
measurements done in the 0.8 × 0.8 × 3 m tunnel, the ﬂow was almost isotropic. The ratio between the streamwise-
and transverse-velocity dispersions hu2i/hv2i was close to unity.

The turbulence level, i.e., the ratio of the root-mean-square streamwise ﬂuctuation hu2i1/2 to the mean streamwise
velocity U , was always less than 10%. This good characteristic of grid turbulence allows us to rely on the frozen-
eddy hypothesis of Taylor [19], ∂/∂t = −U ∂/∂x, which converts temporal variations into spatial variations in the
mean-wind direction.

To obtain the highest spatial resolution, we set fc in such a way that U/fc is close to the probe size, ∼ 1 mm.
Since the probe size is greater than the Kolmogorov length, 0.2–0.5 mm, the smallest-scale motions of the ﬂow were
ﬁltered out. The present resolution is nevertheless typical of hot-wire anemometry. Although the RELIEF technique
achieves a higher resolution [11], it is applicable only to the transverse velocity.

Consequently we obtained 10 sets of turbulence data. The experimental conditions are summarized in Table I. The
ﬂow parameters such as the integral length L, the Kolmogorov length η, the Taylor microscale λ, and the Reynolds
number Reλ are also summarized there.

Before describing our experimental results, it is helpful to present a model for a vortex tube, Burgers vortex [20].
This model is an axisymmetric steady circulation in a strain ﬁeld. In cylindrical coordinates, the circulation and the
strain ﬁeld are written respectively as

Here ν is the kinematic viscosity. The above Eq. (1a) describes a rigid-body rotation for small radii, and a circulation

radius.

Suppose that the vortex tube penetrates the (x, y) plane at the point (0, ∆). The x and y axes are, respectively,
in the streamwise and transverse directions. If the direction of the tube axis is (θ, ϕ) in spherical coordinates, the
streamwise (u) and transverse (v) components of the circulation ﬂow uΘ along the x axis are

If the vortex tube passes close to the probe (∆ <
∼ r0) and the tube is not heavily inclined (θ ≃ 0), the transverse
velocity is dominated by the circulation ﬂow. The streamwise velocity is dominated by the radial inﬂow. This situation
is of particular interest. If ∆ ≫ r0, the tube signal is weak. If θ ≫ 0, the transverse velocity is dominated by the
radial inﬂow, which is of large scale and does not contribute to the small-scale intermittency.

The velocity proﬁles of vortex tubes with ∆ <

∼ r0 and θ ≃ 0 are nearly the same [13, 21]. However, as implied by
the ﬁrst term of Eq. (3), the radius rx of a tube observed along the streamwise direction is diﬀerent from its intrinsic
radius r0 as rx ≃ r0/(1 − sin2 θ cos2 ϕ)1/2. Thus, even if the intrinsic radii of the vortex tubes are the same, they
contribute to a range of the scales.

Hereafter we describe our experimental results. Except for Fig. 6, the following diagrams present the results only for
the experiments 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (see Table I). We nevertheless obtained consistent results for the other experiments.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Velocity proﬁle of vortex tube

The streamwise-velocity increment δu(δx) = u(x + δx) − u(x) or the transverse-velocity increment δv(δx) = v(x +
δx) − v(x) is enhanced in an intermittency event. We obtain velocity patterns typical of the intermittency events
by averaging signals centered at the position where the transverse-velocity increment is enhanced over its root-mean-
square value by more than a factor of 3, i.e., |δv| > 3hδv2i1/2. The scale δx is set to be the spatial resolution U/fc.
Such an event is detected 2.1–5.9 times per the integral length. When the increment is negative, we invert the sign of
the v signal.

The numerical factor of 3 in our above criterion comes from a compromise. If the factor is larger, the total number
of the events is smaller, and hence statistical uncertainty in the velocity patterns is more signiﬁcant. If the factor
It was nevertheless ascertained that our
is smaller, the velocity patterns are less representative of intermittency.
following results depend only weakly on the choice of the numerical factor if it is in the range 2–4.

The results are shown in Fig. 1 (solid lines). The u pattern is shown separately for δu > 0 and δu ≤ 0 at x = 0
(designated, respectively, as u+ and u−). For reference, we show velocity proﬁles (2b) and (4a) of a Burgers vortex
with ∆ = 0 and θ = 0 (dotted lines). The tube radius r0 was determined so as to reproduce the v pattern for each of
the experiments.

The v pattern of grid turbulence is close to the proﬁle of a Burgers vortex [11, 12]. Vortex tubes are surely
responsible for small-scale intermittency in the transverse velocity. The radii r0 of the vortex tubes are estimated to

4

be several of the Kolmogorov length η, r0 ≃ (6–7) η, regardless of the Reynolds number Reλ [2, 3, 21]. Since these
estimates are well above the δx values, they should represent typical radii of vortex tubes.

Especially when the Reynolds number is high, the v pattern is extended as compared with the proﬁle of a Burgers
vortex. There should be additional contributions from vortex sheets, for which the velocity signal exhibits some kind
of step, and also from vortex tubes with θ ≫ 0.

The u± patterns of grid turbulence appear to be dominated by the circulation ﬂows uΘ of vortex tubes passing
the probe at some distances ∆ > 0 [Eq. (2a)]. There is no signiﬁcance of the radial inﬂow ur of the strain ﬁeld [Eq.
(4a)], except that the u− pattern has a larger amplitude and is detected 1.3–1.5 times more frequently than the u+
pattern. A vortex tube is not always oriented to the stretching direction [1, 2, 22].

The amplitude of the velocity pattern is normalized by the Kolmogorov velocity uK. This normalized amplitude is
nearly the same for diﬀerent Reynolds numbers. If normalized by the root-mean-square velocity ﬂuctuation hu2i1/2
or hv2i1/2, the amplitude is smaller at a higher Reynolds number. The typical strength of vortex tubes appears to
scale with the Kolmogorov velocity rather than the root-mean-square velocity ﬂuctuation, although the present result
is biased toward strong tubes.

The u± patterns are embedded in one-sided excursions, u ≃ uK ≃ a few tenths of hu2i1/2 > 0, which extends to x
≃ ±L. This could be due to an artifact of our measurement or analysis. For example, the streamwise velocity has a
ﬂuctuation of the order hu2i1/2 over the scale L. Thus the speed at which a vortex tube passes the probe is higher or
lower than the mean wind speed. The tube radius estimated with the frozen-eddy hypothesis is accordingly smaller
or larger than its intrinsic rx value. Since the scale δx = U/fc is at around the typical tube radius r0, vortex tubes
with θ > 0 and hence rx > δx are more numerous than those with rx < δx. Fast-moving vortex tubes with rx > δx
are captured in our conditional averaging for the scale δx and could cause the observed u excursions. Alternatively,
large-scale ﬂows that are responsible for the excursions could preferentially generate vortex tubes.

For the larger scales δx <

∼ λ, our conditional averaging yields nearly the same patterns as those in Fig. 1. Velocity
signals at large scales reﬂect vortex tubes that are inclined to the mean-wind direction (Sec. III). Large-radius vortex
tubes could be also important. With increasing the scale still more, the background ﬂow is increasingly predominant
(Sec. IV C). It is increasingly diﬃcult to capture vortex tubes.

Velocity patterns are extracted also for enhancements of the streamwise-velocity increment δu(δx) at the scale
δx = U/fc. The results for δu > +3hδu2i1/2 are shown in Fig. 2, while those for δu < −3hδu2i1/2 are shown in Fig. 3.
The v pattern was obtained by conditioning over the sign of the local slope. Since the v pattern is close to the proﬁle
of a Burgers vortex, intermittency in the streamwise velocity is also attributable to vortex tubes. The tube radii are
several of the Kolmogorov length. On the other hand, the u pattern is explained by the circulation ﬂow uΘ passing the
probe at some distance ∆ > 0. The radial inﬂow ur is also important to the u pattern for the event δu < −3hδu2i1/2,
which is detected 1.6–2.5 times more frequently than the event δu > +3hδu2i1/2 (see also Sec. IV D).

B. Spatial distribution of vortex tubes

To study the spatial distribution of vortex tubes, we study the probability density distribution of an interval δx′
between successive enhancements of the transverse-velocity increment, |δv| > 3hδv2i1/2. Here δv(δx) = v(x+δx)−v(x)
is computed at the scale δx = U/fc.

The results are shown in Fig. 4 (solid lines). The probability density distribution has an exponential tail that
appears linear on the semi-log plot (dotted lines). This exponential distribution of the interval is characteristic of
random, independent, and rare events [5]. However, at a small interval that is several times the Kolmogorov scale η,
the distribution has a pronounced peak. Vortex tubes tend to cluster together [5, 6, 12].

With increasing the Reynolds number Reλ, the probability density distribution becomes to have a more pronounced
peak. The clustering of vortex tubes becomes more signiﬁcant. Figures 1–3 actually show that the intermittency
patterns at high Reynolds numbers are somewhat uneven.

C. Flatness factor

For velocity increments δu(δx) = u(x + δx) − u(x) and δv(δx) = v(x + δx) − v(x), we compute the ﬂatness factors

at each of the scales δx:

Fδu =

and Fδv =

hδu4i
hδu2i2

hδv4i
hδv2i2 .

(5)

If the probability density distribution of the velocity increment is Gaussian, the ﬂatness factor is equal to 3. If the
distribution has a more pronounced tail than a Gaussian distribution, the ﬂatness factor is larger than 3. Since

the transverse-velocity pattern averaged for enhancements of velocity increments is close to the proﬁle of a Burgers
vortex (Sec. IV A), the ﬂatness factor serves as a measure of the relative importance between vortex tubes and the
background ﬂow. The latter is a superposition of random and independent motions, for which the velocity increment
is expected to follow a Gaussian distribution [13, 17, 18].

Figure 5 shows the ﬂatness factor for the transverse-velocity increment δv (solid lines). At large scales, the ﬂatness
factor is equal to the Gaussian value of 3. This is due to predominance of the background ﬂow. As the scale is
decreased from the integral length L, the ﬂatness factor begins to increase. This is due to increasing contribution of
vortex tubes. They aﬀect velocity increments at scales around the observed sizes rx, which could be as large as the
tube lengths that are of the order of the integral length [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Around the Taylor microscale λ, the
increase of the ﬂatness factor becomes signiﬁcant.

Figure 5 also shows the ﬂatness factor for the streamwise-velocity increment δu, which is less enhanced than that
for the transverse-velocity increment δv [1, 2, 23]. Judging from Figs. 2 and 3, the streamwise ﬂatness factor reﬂects
the energetical importance of vortex tubes as in the case of the transverse ﬂatness factor. However, the amplitude of
the u pattern of a vortex tube tends to be less pronounced than that of the v pattern. This is because the circulation
ﬂow uΘ of a vortex tube contributes to the streamwise velocity only if its axis passes at some distance from the probe,
∆ > 0 [Eq. (2a)].

Figure 6(a) shows the ﬂatness factors for increments of the streamwise (ﬁlled symbols) and transverse (open symbols)
velocities at the ﬁxed scales δx = 10η (circles) and λ (squares). The scale δx = 10η is roughly the minimum scale
resolved in all the measurements. With increasing the Reynolds number Reλ, the ﬂatness factors increase. Vortex
tubes are increasingly predominant over the background ﬂow at a higher Reynolds number. The increase of the
ﬂatness factors is more signiﬁcant at the smaller scale δx = 10η, where the background ﬂow is less important. The
increase is also more signiﬁcant for the transverse-velocity increment [2], which is more sensitive to vortex tubes than
the streamwise-velocity increment.

D. Skewness factor

Su =

hδu3i
hδu2i3/2 .

The skewness factor for the streamwise-velocity increment δu(δx) = u(x + δx) − u(x) is also studied at each of the

scales δx. The deﬁnition of the skewness factor is

This quantity characterizes the degree of asymmetry. Its negative value implies that the probability density distribu-
tion has a pronounced tail extending to the negative δu.

The results are shown in Fig. 7 (solid lines). At large scales that are more than a few times greater than the rod
spacing of the grid M , the skewness factor is equal to the Gaussian value of 0. As the scale is decreased, the skewness
factor begins to decrease. This decrease reﬂects the energy cascade from large to small scales [7, 8]. Around the
Taylor microscale λ, the decrease becomes signiﬁcant. This negative enhancement of the velocity increment is due to
the strain ﬁelds associated with vortex tubes (Sec. IV A).

We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant dependence of the skewness factor at a ﬁxed scale on the Reynolds number Reλ. This is
It is known that the skewness factor of the

because our experiments do not cover a suﬃciently wide Reλ range.
velocity derivative h(∂u/∂x)3i/h(∂u/∂x)2i3/2 decreases slowly with increasing the Reynolds number [8].

E. Streamwise-transverse correlation

Since our conditional averaging revealed that the circulation ﬂow of a vortex tube tends to contribute simultaneously
to the streamwise and transverse velocities (Sec. IV A), we study the correlation between velocity increments of these
two components [17]:

Cδuδv =

hδu2δv2i − hδu2ihδv2i
(hδu4i − hδu2i2)1/2(hδv4i − hδv2i2)1/2 .

The value of Cδuδv ranges from 0, if there is no correlation, to ±1, if there is a linear correlation.

The results are shown in Fig. 8 (solid lines). At large scales that are more than a few times greater than the
rod spacing of the grid M , the correlation is absent. As the scale is decreased, the correlation coeﬃcient begins to
increase. This is because variations of the streamwise and transverse velocities tend to be enhanced simultaneously
at the position of a strong large-scale motion. The increase of the correlation coeﬃcient becomes signiﬁcant around

5

(6)

(7)

6

the integral length L and becomes still more signiﬁcant around the Taylor microscale λ. This is due to increasing
contribution of vortex tubes.

Figure 6(b) shows the streamwise-transverse correlation at the ﬁxed scales δx = 10η (circles) and λ (squares). With

increasing the Reynolds number Reλ, the correlation becomes signiﬁcant especially at the smaller scale δx = 10η.

V. CONCLUSION

The streamwise (u) and transverse (v) velocities were measured simultaneously in isotropic grid turbulence at
Reynolds numbers Reλ ≃ 110–330. First, we used conditional averaging to extract typical intermittency patterns
(Figs. 1–3). Since the v pattern is close to the velocity proﬁle of a Burgers vortex, the intermittency is attributable to
vortex tubes. The tube radius is several times the Kolmogorov length regardless of the Reynolds number. Since the u
pattern is not always dominated by the strain ﬁeld, it was concluded that a vortex tube is not always oriented to the
stretching direction. Second, we used the distribution of an interval between successive enhancements of a small-scale
velocity increment to study the spatial distribution of vortex tubes (Fig. 4). It was found that vortex tubes tend to
cluster together. This tendency becomes signiﬁcant with the Reynolds number. Third, we used the ﬂatness, skewness,
and streamwise-transverse correlation of velocity increments to study the energetical contribution of vortex tubes as
a function of the scale (Figs. 5–8). The contribution of vortex tubes is discernible below the integral length, which is
comparable to the tube lengths, and it is signiﬁcant below the Taylor microscale. At a ﬁxed scale, the contribution
becomes signiﬁcant with the Reynolds number.

Some of the above results had been reported in past studies. However, they are either numerical simulations with
∼ 200 [1, 2, 3], laboratory experiments of isotropic turbulence with low Reynolds numbers,
∼ 100 [22], or laboratory experiments of anisotropic turbulence [5, 6, 11, 12, 21, 23]. We are the ﬁrst to study

low Reynolds numbers, Reλ <
Reλ <
vortex tubes in isotropic turbulence at relatively high Reynolds numbers, Reλ ≃ 110–330.

Since some tube parameters change as the Reynolds number, experimental studies of them at the higher Reynolds
numbers are desirable. It is diﬃcult to achieve Reλ ≫ 300 in ordinary grid turbulence. Other ﬂow conﬁgurations
such as a boundary layer and a jet are of interest.

The velocity patterns of vortex tubes studied here were biased toward strong tubes because they were obtained
by averaging for enhancements of a velocity increment. If velocity patterns averaged for vortex tubes with various
strengths were available, they would be more representative. Then it would be possible to conﬁrm possible interesting
properties of vortex tubes, e.g., dependence of their typical strengths on the Reynolds number. Mouri and Takaoka
[24] proposed to identify vortex tubes as local maxima on the scale-space plot of wavelet transforms of the velocity
data (see also Ref. [13]). The application of such a technique to turbulence data with a range of the Reynolds number
is desirable.

FIG. 1: Conditional averages of the streamwise (u) and transverse (v) velocities for |δv| > 3hδv2i1/2 at the scale δx = U/fc in
the experiments 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (from top to bottom). The abscissa is the spatial position x normalized by the Kolmogorov
length η. On the ordinate, the unit scale corresponds to the Kolmogorov velocity uK . We show the streamwise velocity
separately for δu > 0 (u+) and δu ≤ 0 (u−). The peak amplitudes of the v patterns are 0.179, 0.179, 0.315, 0.306, and 0.449
m s−1. The values of 3hδv2i1/2 are 0.150, 0.103, 0.270, 0.267, and 0.430 m s−1. The detection rates of the u+ event per the
integral length are 0.9, 2.1, 2.1, 2.4, and 2.5. Those of the u− event are 1.2, 2.8, 3.0, 3.4, and 3.4. The proﬁles of Burgers
vortices are shown with dotted lines. Their radii r0 are 5.5η, 5.9η, 5.8η, 5.8η and 7.2η.

FIG. 2: Conditional averages of the streamwise (u) and transverse (v) velocities for δu > +3hδu2i1/2 at the scale δx = U/fc in
the experiments 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (from top to bottom). The abscissa is the spatial position x normalized by the Kolmogorov
length η. On the ordinate, the unit scale corresponds to the Kolmogorov velocity uK. The peak amplitudes of the u patterns
are 0.256, 0.233, 0.407, 0.364, and 0.516 m s−1. The values of 3hδu2i1/2 are 0.124, 0.071, 0.190, 0.187, and 0.299 m s−1. The
detection rates per the integral length are 0.5, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6 and 1.8. The proﬁles of Burgers vortices are shown with dotted
lines. Their radii r0 are 5.5η, 6.5η, 7.7η, 6.7η, and 7.2η.

FIG. 3: Conditional averages of the streamwise (u) and transverse (v) velocities for δu < −3hδu2i1/2 at the scale δx = U/fc in
the experiments 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (from top to bottom). The abscissa is the spatial position x normalized by the Kolmogorov
length η. On the ordinate, the unit scale corresponds to the Kolmogorov velocity uK. The peak amplitudes of the u patterns
are 0.246, 0.221, 0.396, 0.349, and 0.491 m s−1. The detection rates per the integral length are 1.2, 2.7, 2.7, 3.0, and 3.0. The
proﬁles of Burgers vortices are shown with dotted lines. Their radii r0 are 5.5η, 4.7η, 5.8η, 4.8η, and 6.0η.

FIG. 4: Probability density distribution of an interval δx′ between successive enhancements of the transverse-velocity increment
|δv| > 3hδv2i1/2 at the scale δx = U/fc in the experiments 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (from top to bottom). We vertically shift the
probability density distribution by a factor 10. The abscissa is the interval δx′ normalized by the Kolmogorov length η. The
dotted lines denote the results of exponential ﬁt at large intervals.

FIG. 5: Flatness factors for increments of the streamwise (u) and transverse (v) velocities in the experiments 1, 2, 5, 8, and
10 (from top to bottom). The abscissa is the scale δx normalized by the Kolmogorov length η. The arrows denote the integral
length L and the Taylor microscale λ. The dotted lines denote the Gaussian value of 3.

FIG. 6: (a) Flatness factors for increments of the streamwise (ﬁlled symbols) and transverse (open symbols) velocities. (b)
Correlation between increments of the streamwise and transverse velocities. The abscissa is the Reynolds number Reλ. The
circles denote the scale δx = 10η, while the squares denote the scale δx = λ.

FIG. 7: Skewness factor for the streamwise-velocity increment in the experiments 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (from top to bottom). The
abscissa is the scale δx normalized by the Kolmogorov length η. The arrows denote the rod spacing of the grid M , the integral
length L, and the Taylor microscale λ. The dotted lines denote the Gaussian value of 0.

FIG. 8: Correlation between increments of the streamwise and transverse velocities in the experiments 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10 (from
top to bottom). The abscissa is the scale δx normalized by the Kolmogorov length η. The arrows denote the rod spacing of
the grid M , the integral length L, and the Taylor microscale λ. The dotted lines denote the non-correlation value of 0.

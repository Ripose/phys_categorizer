Abstract

The tradition in Navier-Stokes analysis of ﬁnding estimates in terms of the Grashof
number Gr , whose character depends on the ratio of the forcing to the viscosity ν, means
that it is diﬃcult to make comparisons with other results that are expressed in terms of
Reynolds number Re, whose character depends on the ﬂuid response to the forcing. The ﬁrst
task of this paper is to apply the approach of Doering and Foias [20] to the two-dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations on a periodic domain [0, L]2 by estimating quantities of physical
relevance, particularly long-time averages h·i, in terms of the Reynolds number Re = U ℓ/ν,
where U 2 = L−2
In particular, the Constantin-Foias-
Temam upper bound [1] on the attractor dimension converts to a2
, while
ℓ Re (1 + ln Re)
the estimate for the inverse Kraichnan length is (a2
ℓ Re)1/2, where aℓ is the aspect ratio of
the forcing. Other inverse length scales, based on time averages, and associated with higher
derivatives, are estimated in a similar manner. The second task is to address the issue of
intermittency : it is shown how the time axis is broken up into very short intervals on which
various quantities have lower bounds, larger than long time-averages, which are themselves
interspersed by longer, more quiescent, intervals of time.

and ℓ is the forcing scale.

Introduction

1.1 General introduction

In the last two decades the notion of global attractors in parabolic partial diﬀerential equations
has become a well-established concept [1, 2, 3, 4]. The general nature of the dynamics on the
attractor A, in a time averaged sense, can roughly be captured by identifying sharp estimates
of the Lyapunov (or fractal or Hausdorﬀ) dimension of A, or the number of determining modes
[5], with the number of degrees of freedom. Introduced by Landau [6], this latter idea says that
in a dynamical system of spatial dimension d of scale L, the number of degrees of freedom N is
roughly deﬁned to be that number of smallest eddies or features of scale λ and volume λd that
ﬁt into the system volume Ld

(cid:18)
This is the origin of the much-quoted N ∼ Re 9/4 result associated with the three-dimensional
−3/4, where λk is the Kolmogorov
Navier-Stokes equations which rests on taking λ ∼ λk ∼ LRe

length scale. In the absence of any regularity results on the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
equations, at best this is no more than a rule of thumb result. It rests on a more solid and
rigorous foundation, however, for the closely related three-dimensional LANS-α equations for
which Foias, Holm and Titi [7] have proved existence and uniqueness of solutions. Following on
from this, Gibbon and Holm [8] have demonstrated that the dimension of the global attractor
for this system has an upper bound proportional to Re 9/4. An important milestone has been
passed recently in another closely related problem with the establishment by Cao and Titi [9]
of an existence and uniqueness proof for Richardson’s three-dimensional primitive equations for
the atmosphere.

For the Navier-Stokes equations the idea appears more naturally in studies in the two-
dimensional context. The existence and uniqueness of solutions has been a closed problem for
many decades and the existence and nature of the global attractor has been well-established [1-
5, 10-14]. While the two- and three-dimensional equations have the same velocity formulation,
in reality, the former have a tenuous connection with the latter because of the absence of the
drastic property of vortex stretching. As a result, the presence of vortex stretching in three
dimensions, and perhaps other more subtle properties, have set up seemingly unsurmountable
hurdles even on periodic boundary conditions. For problems on non-periodic boundaries, such
as lid-driven ﬂow, solving the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is a technically more
demanding problem – see some references in [10, 15, 16].

The sharp estimate found by Constantin, Foias & Temam [1] for the Lyapunov dimension of

the global attractor A expressed in terms of the Grashof number Gr

dL(A) ≤ c1Gr 2/3 (1 + ln Gr )1/3 ,

(1.2)

has been one of the most signiﬁcant results in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes analysis on a
periodic domain Ω = [0, L]2
per. However, the traditional length scale in the two-dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations is the Kraichnan length, ηk, which plays an equivalent role in two
dimensions to that of the Kolmogorov length, λk, which is more important in three dimensions.
In two dimensions, these are deﬁned respectively in terms of the enstrophy and energy dissipation

If dL is identiﬁed with the number of degrees of freedom N , this result is consistent with the idea
expressed in (1.1) that in a two-dimensional domain, the average length scale of the smallest
vortical feature λ can be identiﬁed with the Kraichnan length ηk, to within log-corrections.

While these results display a pleasing convergence between rigorous estimates and scaling
methods in the two-dimensional case, the tradition in Navier-Stokes analysis of ﬁnding estimates
in terms of the Grashof number Gr , whose character depends on the ratio of the forcing to the
viscosity ν, means that it is diﬃcult to compare with the results of scaling theories whose re-
sults are expressed in terms of Reynolds number. One of the tasks of this paper is to estimate
quantities of physical relevance, particularly long-time averages, in terms of the Reynolds num-
ber, whose character depends on the ﬂuid response to the forcing, and which is intrinsically a
property of Navier-Stokes solutions. Doering and Foias [20] have addressed this problem and
have shown that in the limit Gr → ∞, solutions of the d-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
must satisfy1

Gr ≤ c (Re 2 + Re) ,

(1.7)

while the energy dissipation rate ǫ has a lower bound proportional to Gr . The problem, however,
is not as simple as replacing standard estimates in terms of Gr by Re 2 as (1.7) would imply.
Estimates such as that for dL in (1.2) and the inverse Kraichnan and Kolmogorov lengths deﬁned
in (1.5), depend upon long time-averages of the enstrophy and energy dissipation rates deﬁned
in (1.3). Other estimates of inverse length scales (to be discussed in §1.2) also depend upon
long time-averages. When estimated in terms of Re all these turn out to be better than straight
substitution using (1.7). These results are summarized in §1.2 and worked out in detail in §2.

The second topic to be addressed in this paper is that of intermittency. Originally this
important eﬀect was considered to be a high Reynolds number phenomenon associated with
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes ﬂows. First discovered by Batchelor and Townsend [21], it
manifests itself in violent ﬂuctuations of very short duration in the energy dissipation rate ǫ.
These violent ﬂuctuations away from the average are interspersed by quieter, longer periods in
the dynamics. This is a well established, experimentally observable phenomenon [22, 23, 24]; its
appearance in systems other than the Navier-Stokes equations has been discussed in an early and
easily accessible paper by Frisch & Morf [25]. One symptom of its occurrence is the deviation
of the ‘ﬂatness’ of a velocity signal (the ratio of the 4th order moment to the square of the 2nd
order moment) from the value of 3 that holds for Gaussian statistics.

Recent analysis discussing intermittency in three-dimensional Navier-Stokes ﬂows shows that
while it may be connected with loss of regularity, the two are subtly diﬀerent issues [26]. This
is reinforced by the fact that although solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations
remain regular for arbitrarily long times, nevertheless many of its solutions at high Re are known
to be intermittent: see references in [27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. While three-dimensional analysis of the
problem is based on the assumption that a solution exists [26, 32], so that the higher norms can
be diﬀerentiated, no such assumption is necessary in the two-dimensional case where existence
and uniqueness are guaranteed. The result in both dimensions is such that the time-axis is
broken up into good and bad intervals : on the latter there exist large lower bounds on certain
quantities, necessarily resulting in their extreme narrowness and thus manifesting themselves as
spikes in the data. This is summarized in §1.2 and worked out in detail in §4.

1This result is not advertised in [20] but follows immediately from their equation (48).

1.2 Summary and interpretation

For simplicity the forcing f (x) in the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations (div u = 0)

ut + u · ∇u = ν∆u − ∇p + f (x)

is taken to be divergence-free and smooth of narrow-band type, with a characteristic single
length-scale ℓ such that [20, 26, 32]

Moreover, the aspect ratio of the forcing length scale to the box scale is deﬁned as

With frms = L−d/2kf k2, the usual deﬁnition of the Grashof number Gr appearing in (1.7) in
d-dimensions is

where h·i is the long-time average deﬁned in (1.4). One of the main results of this paper is the
following theorem whose proof is given in §2.1. All generic constants are designated as c.

Theorem 1.1. Let u(x, t) be a solution of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations (1.8)
on a periodic domain [0, L]2, and subject to smooth, divergence-free, narrow-band forcing f (x).

In the short proof of this theorem in §2.1, the estimate for dL in (1.14) is not re-worked from
ﬁrst principles but is derived from a combination of (1.13) and (1.14). The result in (1.15) comes
from a Re 5/2 bound on hH1i and has also recently been found by Alexakis [33]. It implies that

whereas in three-dimensions the right hand side is O(1).

The estimates for η

−1
k and dL are consistent with the long-standing belief that Re 1/2 × Re 1/2
grid points are needed to numerically resolve a ﬂow; indeed, when the aspect ratio is taken into
account, Theorem 1.1 is consistent with aℓRe 1/2 × aℓRe 1/2. However, both these estimates are

dependent upon only the time average of low moments of the velocity ﬁeld. For non-Gaussian
ﬂows, low-order moments are not suﬃcient to uniquely determine the statistics of a ﬂow. Thus it
is necessary to ﬁnd ways of estimating small length scales associated with higher-order moments.
In §2.2 we follow the way of deﬁning inverse length scales associated with derivatives higher than
two, introduced elsewhere [18], by combining the forcing with higher derivatives of the velocity
ﬁeld such that

Fn =

|∇nu|2 + τ 2|∇nf |2

(1.17)

where τ = ℓ2ν−1[Gr (1 + ln Gr )]
2 is a characteristic time : this choice of τ is discussed in
Appendix A. The gradient symbol ∇n within (1.17) refers to all derivatives of every component
of u of order n in L2(Ω). The Fn are used to deﬁne a set of time-dependent inverse length scales

More relevant to the two-dimensional case, κ2(n−1)
behaves as the 2(n − 1)th-moment of the
n,1
enstrophy spectrum. Using Landau’s argument in association with (1.6), we identiﬁed the
dimension of the global attractor dL(A) with the number of degrees of freedom N .
In [19]
a deﬁnition was introduced to represent the number of degrees of freedom associated with all
higher derivatives of the velocity ﬁeld represented by κn,r, which is itself an inverse length. Thus
we deﬁne

Nn,r = L2

and, along with this, also deﬁne the quantities Λn,0 and Λn,1 for n ≥ 2

Then the second main result of the paper is written as the following theorem whose proof is
given in §2.2.

Theorem 1.2. Let κn,r be the moments of a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes velocity ﬁeld deﬁned
in (1.18). Then in a two-dimensional periodic box of side L the numbers of degrees of freedom
Nn,1 and Nn,0 deﬁned in (1.20) are estimated as (n ≥ 2)

Nn,1 ≤ cn(a2

ℓ Re)Λn,1 (1 + ln Re)1/2 ,

Nn,0 ≤ cn(a2

ℓ Re)Λn,0 (1 + ln Re)1/2

where Λn,0 and Λn,1 are deﬁned in (1.21).

Note that Λ2,0 = Λ2,1 = 1. Thus the estimate for the ﬁrst in each sequence, N2,1 and N1,0, are of
ℓ Re(1 + ln Re)1/3 except in the exponent of the
the same order as the estimate for dL, namely a2
logarithm. The exponents in (1.22) and (1.23) provide an estimate of the extra resolution that
is needed to take account of energy at sub-Kraichnan scales. Notice that in the limit n → ∞
both exponents converge to 3/2.

The intermittency results of §4 show that there can exist small intervals of time where there
are large lower bounds on κ2
n,1 that are much larger than the upper bound on the long-time
κ2
. Translated into pictorial terms (see Figure 1 in §4) this means that there is
average for
n,1
spiky data where the spikes must be of very short duration. Estimates are found for the width
of these spikes which turn out to be in terms of a negative exponent of Re.

2 Time average estimates in terms of Re

2.1 Proof of Theorem 1.1

The ﬁrst step in the proof of Theorem 1.1, which has been expressed in §1.2, is to ﬁnd an upper
bound on hH2i in terms of Re. Consider the equation for the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
vorticity ω = ω ˆk

where the forcing term has been integrated by parts in (2.4) and the narrow-band property has
been used to move from (2.5) to (2.6). Using the deﬁnitions of Re, Gr , and aℓ in (1.12), (1.11)
and (1.10), the long-time average of H2 is estimated as

This holds the key to the three results in Theorem 1.1.

The inverse Kraichnan length η

and so

Lη

k ≤ c (a2

which is (1.13) of Theorem (1.1). The estimate for dL in (1.14) then follows immediately from
the relation between the estimate for dL in (1.6) and (2.10).

Finally, we turn to proving the estimate for hH1i in (1.15) which turns around the use of the

simple inequality H 2

1 ≤ H2H0. The next step is to use the fact that

Using the upper bound in (2.7) gives

hH1i ≤ hH2i1/2 hH0i1/2
= νaℓRe hH2i1/2 .

hH1i ≤ c ν2a2

ℓ ℓ2Re 5/2 ,

which then gives (1.15) in Theorem (1.1). In fact, (1.15) is an improvement in the bound for
hH1i from Re 3 to Re 5/2. This result has also been found recently by Alexakis [33].

2.2 Proof of Theorem 1.2

Having introduced the notation for Hn in (2.2), similar quantities are used that contain the
forcing [32, 26], namely

deﬁned ﬁrst in (1.17), and the moments κn,r deﬁned in (1.18)

The parameter τ in (2.14) is a time scale and needs to be chosen appropriately. The idea is
that it should be chosen in such a way that the forcing does not dominate the behavior of the
moments of the velocity ﬁeld. Deﬁning ω0 = ℓ−2ν, it is shown in Appendix A that this end is
achieved if τ −1 is chosen as

As a preliminary to the proof of Theorem 1.2, we state the ladder theorem proved in [32, 26].

The L∞-inequalities in Theorem 2.1, particularly k∇uk∞ in (2.20), can be handled using a
modiﬁed from of the L∞-inequality of Brezis and Gallouet that has already been proved in [18] :

Lemma 2.1. In terms of the Fn of (2.14) and κn,r of (2.15), a modiﬁed form of the two-

having used the narrow-band property on (3.2). Upon combining Poincar´e’s inequality with
Lemmas B.1 and B.2 in Appendix B we obtain

and

ℓ ν2Re 4 ,

limt→∞H1 ≤ c ℓ

ℓ ν2Gr 2 ≤ c ℓ

ℓ ν2Re 4 .

The additive forcing terms in F1 and F0 are of a lower order in Re so we end up with

ℓ ν2Re 4 + O(Re 2) ,

limt→∞F1 ≤ c ℓ

ℓ ν2Re 4 + O(Re 2) .

The estimate for F1 enables us to obtain point-wise estimates on Fn, n ≥ 2 [18, sec. 7.2]. In

Intermittency: good and bad intervals

We now address the issue of intermittency. While the Fn and κn,r are bounded from above for
all time, nevertheless it is possible that their behaviour could be spiky in an erratic manner. To
show how this might come about, consider the deﬁnition of κn,r in (1.18) from which we ﬁnd

where the cn are the same as those in Theorem (1.2). Hence there exists at least one interval of
time, designated as a ‘good interval’, on which the inequality

holds. Those other parts of the time-axis on which the reverse inequality

Remark: In principle, the whole time-axis could be a good interval, whereas the positive time
average in (4.5) ensures that the complete time-axis cannot be ‘bad’. This paper is based on the
worst-case supposition that bad intervals exist, that they could be multiple in number, and that
the good and the bad are interspersed. The precise distribution and occurrence of the good/bad
intervals and how they depend on n remains an open question. The contrast between 2D and
3D Navier-Stokes is prominent; while no singularities can occur in the κn,1 in the 2D case, in
3D it is within these bad intervals that they can potentially occur.
Proof: Take two parameters 0 < µ < 1 and 0 < α < 1 such that µ + α = 1. The inverses µ−1

Two-dimensional Navier-Stokes information can be injected into these formal manipulations:
from Theorem (1.2) and the lower bound Lκn,1 ≥ 1 are used in the
the upper bound on
ratio on the far right hand side of (4.9) to give (4.5), with the same cn as in Theorem (1.2). (cid:4)
Now consider what must happen on bad intervals. It is always true that κn+1,1/κn,1 ≥ 1,

κ2
n,1

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

so (4.7) implies that on these intervals there is a lower bound

L2κ2

n,1 > cn(a2

ℓ Re)Λn,1/µ(1 + ln Re)1/2µ .

This lower bound cannot be greater than the upper point-wise bound in (3.13), which means
that µ is restricted by

Moreover, the factor of 1/µ in the exponent makes the lower bound in (4.10) much larger than
given in Theorem (1.2). This means that these intervals
the upper bound on the average
must be very short. To estimate how large they can be requires an integration of (4.3) over short
times ∆t = t − t0 which, in turn, requires the time-integral of H1 for short times ∆t. We use
the notation

then

ω0∆t ≤ c (a2

ℓ Re)4−Λn,1/µ .

Because the exponent in (4.17) is necessarily negative these intervals are very small and decreas-
ing with increasing Re. Combining (4.11) with (4.16) we have

(n − 1)
2(2n − 1)

which actually holds for every n ≥ 1. Figure 1 is a cartoon-like ﬁgure displaying the lower
bound on the bad intervals of width (∆t)b and also the maximum of κn,1 allowed by (3.13) in
Lemma 3.2. The full dynamics of two-dimensional Navier-Stokes is actually determined by the
intersection of all cartoons for every n ≥ 3 on the grounds that the position and occurrence of
the bad intervals varies with n. Thus we are interested in the limit n → ∞ which determines
that the range of µ is squeezed between

We conclude that the interval theorem (Theorem 4.1) reproduces the eﬀects of intermittency
in a two-dimensional ﬂow by manifesting very large lower bounds within bad intervals and
suppressing spiky behaviour within the good intervals which must be quiescent for long intervals,
otherwise the long-time average would be violated.

A Forcing & the ﬂuid response

For technical reasons, we must address the possibility that in their evolution the quantities Hn
might take small values. Thus we need to circumvent problems that may arise when dividing by
these (squared) semi-norms. We follow Doering and Gibbon [32] who introduced the modiﬁed
quantities

Fn = Hn + τ 2k∇nf k2
2 ,

where the “time-scale” τ is to be chosen for our convenience. So long as τ 6= 0, the Fn are
bounded away from zero by the explicit value τ 2L3ℓ−2nf 2
rms. Moreover, we may choose τ to
depend on the parameters of the problem such that hFni ∼ hHni as Gr → ∞. To see how to
achieve this, let us deﬁne

τ = ℓ2ν

−1[Gr (1 + ln Gr )]

−1/2 .

Then the additional term in (A.1) is

τ 2k∇nf k2

Hence, the additional forcing term in (A.1) becomes negligible with respect to hHni as Gr → ∞,
so the forcing does not dominate the response.

B Comparison theorems for ODEs

We present a comparison theorem for ODE which is useful for obtaining various estimates. We
start with the following classical result.

Lemma B.1. Let f : [0, T ]×R → R be a continuous function which is locally Lipschitz uniformly
in t: for all intervals [a, b] ⊂ R there exists a constant such that |f (s, x) − f (s, y)| ≤ C|x − y|
for all x, y ∈ [a, b] and all s ∈ [0, T ]. Furthermore, let x ∈ AC([0, T ], R) be such that

˙x(t) ≤ f (t, x(t))

for all t ∈ [0, T ] and let y(t) be the solution of ˙y(t) = f (t, y(t)) on [0, T ]. Assume further that
x(0) ≤ y(0). Then, x(t) ≤ y(t) for all t ∈ [0, T ].

We can use this Lemma to prove the following useful result.

Lemma B.2. Let x : [0, T ] → [0, ∞) be an absolutely continuous function with x(0) > 0 which
satisﬁes

˙x ≤ ∆0x + F xn1 − Exn2,

where ∆0, F, E > 0 and 1 < n1 < n2. Then

Fractal Interpolation has been proposed in the literature as an eﬃcient way to construct closure
models for the numerical solution of coarse-grained Navier-Stokes equations. It is based on synthet-
ically generating a scale-invariant small-scale ﬁeld and analytically evaluating its eﬀects on large
resolved scales. In this paper, we propose an extension of previous work by developing a multiaﬃne
fractal interpolation scheme and demonstrate that it preserves not only the fractal dimension but
also the higher-order structure functions and the non-Gaussian probability density functions of the
velocity increments. The pertinence of this newly proposed method in the case of passive scalars is
also shown.

Generation of turbulence-like ﬁelds (also known as
Synthetic Turbulence) has received considerable atten-
tion in recent years. Several schemes have been proposed
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with diﬀerent degrees of success in repro-
ducing various characteristics of turbulence. Recently,
Scotti and Meneveau [6, 7] further broadened the scope
of synthetic turbulence research by demonstrating its po-
tential in computational modeling. Their innovative tur-
bulence emulation scheme based on the Fractal Interpo-
lation Technique (FIT) [8, 9] was found to be particu-
larly amenable for a speciﬁc type of turbulence model-
ing, known as Large-Eddy Simulation (LES, at present
the most eﬃcient technique available for high Reynolds
number ﬂow simulations, in which the larger scales of
motion are resolved explicitly and the smaller ones are
modeled). The underlying idea was to explicitly recon-
struct the subgrid (unresolved) scales from given resolved
scale values (assuming computation grid-size falls in the
inertial range of turbulence) using FIT and subsequently
estimate the relevant subgrid-scale (SGS) tensors nec-
essary for LES. Simplicity, straightforward extensibility
for multi-dimensional cases, and low computational com-
plexity (appropriate use of fractal calculus can even elim-
inate the computationally expensive explicit reconstruc-
tion step, see [6, 7] for details) makes this FIT-based
approach an attractive candidate for SGS modeling in
LES.

Although the approach of [6, 7] is better suited for LES
than any other similar schemes (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), it
falls short in preserving the essential small-scale proper-
ties of turbulence, such as multiaﬃnity (will be deﬁned
shortly) and non-Gaussian characteristics of the proba-
bility density function (pdf) of velocity increments. It is
the purpose of this work to improve the approach of [6, 7]
in terms of realistic turbulence-like signal generation with
all the aforementioned desirable characteristics. We will

further demonstrate the competence of our scheme in the
emulation of passive-scalar ﬁelds.

The fractal interpolation technique is an iterative aﬃne
mapping procedure to construct a synthetic determinis-
tic small-scale ﬁeld (in general fractal provided certain
conditions are met, see below) given a few large-scale in-
terpolating points (anchor points). For an excellent trea-
tise on this subject, the reader is referred to the book by
Barnsley [9]. In this paper, we will limit our discussion
(without loss of generality) only to the case of three in-
terpolating data points: {(xi, ui) , i = 0, 1, 2}. For this
case, the fractal interpolation iterative function system
, where, wn have
(IFS) is of the form
the following aﬃne transformation structure:

R2; wn, n = 1, 2
(cid:9)

(cid:18)

, n = 1, 2.

(1)

To ensure continuity, the transformations are constrained

by the given data points as follows: wn

un (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:18)

(cid:18)
parameters an, cn, en and fn can be easily determined in
terms of dn (known as the vertical stretching factors) and
the given anchor points (xi, ui) by solving a linear system
of equations. The attractor of the above IFS, G, is the
graph of a continuous function u : [x0, x2] → R, which
interpolates the data points (xi, ui), provided the vertical
stretching factors dn obey 0 ≤ |dn| < 1. In other words,

G = {(x, u (x)) : x ∈ [x0, x2]} ,
where,
u (xi) = ui, i = 0, 1, 2.

(2)

Moreover, if |d1| + |d2| > 1 and (xi, ui) are not collinear,
then the fractal (box-counting) dimension of G is the
unique real solution D of |d1| aD−1
= 1
(for rigorous proof see [8]). In the special case of three
equally spaced points covering the unit interval [0,1], i.e.,
x0 = 0, x1 = 0.5 and x2 = 1, the parameters of the
aﬃne transformation kernel become: an = 0.5; cn =

+ |d2| aD−1

1

2

(un − un−1) − dn (u2 − u0) ; en = xn−1; fn = un−1 −
dnu0; n = 1, 2. In this case, the solution for the fractal
dimension (D) becomes:

D = 1 + log2 (|d1| + |d2|)

(3)

Notice that the scalings d1 and d2 are free parameters
and cannot be determined using only equation (3); at
least one more constraint is necessary. For example, [6, 7]
chose to use the additional condition: |d1| = |d2|.

Not long ago, it was found that turbulent velocity sig-
nals at high Reynolds numbers have a fractal dimension
of D ≃ 1.7 ± 0.05, very close to the value of D = 5
3 ex-
pected for Gaussian processes with a − 5
3 spectral slope
[10]. For D = 5
3 , the assumption of |d1| = |d2| along
with equation (3) yields |d1| = |d2| = 2−1/3 [6, 7]. One
contribution of this paper is a robust way of estimating
the stretching parameters without any ad-hoc prescrip-
tion; the resulting synthetic ﬁeld will not only preserve
the fractal dimension (D) but also other fundamental
properties of real turbulence.

As an exploratory example, using the fractal inter-
polation IFS (equation 1), we construct a 217 points
long synthetic fractal series, u (x), with given coarse-
grained points (0.0, 1.2) , (0.5, −0.3) and (1.0, 0.7) and
d1 =
the stretching parameters used in [6, 7]:
−2−1/3, d2 = 2−1/3. Clearly, Figure 1a depicts that the
synthetic series has ﬂuctuations at all scales and it passes
through all three interpolating points. Next, from this
synthetic series we compute higher-order structure func-
tions (see Figure 1b for orders 2, 4 and 6), where the
qth-order structure function, Sq (r), is deﬁned as follows:

Sq (r) = h|u (x + r) − u (x)|qi ∼ rζq

(4)

where, the angular bracket denotes spatial averaging and
r is a distance that varies in an appropriate scaling re-
gion (known as the inertial range in turbulence). If the
scaling exponent ζq is a nonlinear function of q, then fol-
lowing the convention of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the ﬁeld is called
multiaﬃne, otherwise it is termed as monoaﬃne. In this
context, we would like to mention that, Kolmogorov’s
celebrated 1941 hypothesis (a.k.a K41) based on the as-
sumption of global scale invariance in the inertial range
predicts that the structure functions of order q scale with
an exponent q
3 over inertial range separations [11, 12].
Deviations from ζq = q
3 would suggest inertial range in-
termittency and invalidate the K41 hypothesis. Inertial
range intermittency is still an unresolved issue, although
experimental evidence for its existence is overwhelming
[11, 13]. To interpret the curvilinear behavior of the ζq
function observed in experimental measurements (e.g.,
[13]), Parisi and Frisch [12, 14] proposed the multifractal
model, by replacing the global scale invariance with the
assumption of local scale invariance. They conjectured
that at very high Reynolds number, turbulent ﬂows have
singularities (almost) everywhere and showed that the

2

singularity spectrum is related to the structure function-
based scaling exponents, ζq by the Legendre transforma-
tion.

Our numerical experiment with the default stretch-
ing parameters of [6, 7], i.e., |d1| = |d2| = 2−1/3, re-
vealed that the scaling exponents follow the K41 pre-
dictions (after ensemble averaging over one hundred re-
alizations corresponding to diﬀerent initial interpolating
points), i.e., ζq = q
3 (not shown here), a signature of
monoaﬃne ﬁelds. Later on, we will give analytical proof
that indeed this is the case for |d1| = |d2| = 2−1/3.
Also, in this case, the pdfs of the velocity increments,
δur (x) = u (x + r)− u (x), always portray near-Gaussian
(slightly ﬂatter core and lower ﬂatness factors) behavior
irrespective of r (see Figure 1c). This is contrary to the
observations [11, 13], where, typically the pdfs of incre-
ments are found to be r dependent and become more
and more non-Gaussian as r decreases. Theoretically,
non-Gaussian characteristics of pdfs correspond to the
presence of intermittency in the velocity increments and
gradients (hence in the energy dissipation) [2, 5, 11, 12].
At this point, we would like to invoke an interesting
mathematical result regarding the scaling exponent spec-
trum, ζq, of the fractal interpolation IFS [15]:

ζq = 1 − logN

(5)

N

Xn=1

|dn|q

where, N = the number of anchor points −1 (in our case
N = 2). The original formulation of [15] was in terms of
a more general scaling exponent spectrum, τ (q), rather
than the structure function based spectrum ζq. The τ (q)
spectrum is an exact Legendre tranform of the singularity
spectrum in the sense that it is valid for any order of mo-
ments (including negative) and any singularities [16, 17].
τ (q) can be reliably estimated from data by the Wavelet-
Transform Modulus-Maxima method [16, 17]. To derive
equation (5) from the original formulation, we made use
of the equality: τ (q) = ζq − 1, which holds for posi-
tive q and for positive singularities of H¨older exponents
less than unity [16, 17]. In turbulence, the most prob-
able H¨older exponent is 0.33 (corresponding to the K41
value) and for all practical purposes the values of H¨older
exponents lie between 0 and 1 (see [18, 19]). Hence the
use of the above equality is well justiﬁed.

Equation (5) could be used to validate our previous
claim, that the default parameters of [6, 7] give rise
to a monoaﬃne ﬁeld (i.e., ζq is a linear function of q).
If we consider |d1| = |d2| = d = 2−1/3, then, ζq =
1 − log2 (|d1|q + |d2|q) = 1 − log2 (2dq) = −q log2 (d) =
−q log2
3 [QED]. Equation (5) could also be
used to derive the classic result of Barnsley regarding the
fractal dimension of IFS. It is well-known [20, 21] that the
graph dimension (or box-counting dimension) is related
to ζ1 as follows: D = 2 − ζ1. Now, using equation (5)

2−1/3
(cid:0)

= q

(cid:1)

we get, D = 2 − ζ1 = 1 + logN

|dn|. For N = 2, we

N

Pi=1

recover equation (3).

Intuitively, by prescribing several scaling exponents, ζq
(which are known apriori from observational data), it is
possible to solve for dn from the overdetermined system
of equations (5). These solved parameters, dn, along with
other easily derivable (from the given anchor points and
dn) parameters (an, cn, en and fn) in turn can be used
to construct multiaﬃne signals. For example, solving for
the values quoted by Frisch [12]: ζ2 = 0.70, ζ3 = 1, ζ4 =
1.28, ζ5 = 1.53, ζ6 = 1.77, ζ7 = 2.01 and ζ8 = 2.23,
along with ζ1 = 0.33 (corresponding to D = 5
3 ), yields
the stretching factors |dn| = 0.8868, 0.6763. There are
altogether eight possible sign combinations for the above
stretching parameter magnitudes and all of them can
potentially produce multiaﬃne ﬁelds with the aforemen-
tioned scaling exponents. However, extensive numerical
experimentation revealed that only the combinations:
(−0.8868, 0.6763), (0.6763, −0.8868), (−0.8868, −0.6763)
and (−0.6763, −0.8868) reproduce realistic turbulence
signals (in terms of mimickning the pdfs of increments
and the visual appearance of the series themselves).
Although all the above four stretching combinations
are quite suitable for synthetic turbulence generation,
all of them might not be the “right” candidate from
LES-performance perspective. Rigorous apriori and
these stretching factors-based
aposteriori testing of
fractal SGS models is needed to elucidate this issue
and this will be the subject of future research (details
on LES SGS model testing can be found in the review
article [22]).

We repeated our previous numerical experiment with
the stretching parameters d1 = −0.8868 and d2 = 0.6763.
Figure 2a shows the measured values (ensemble averaged
over one hundred realizations) of the scaling exponents
ζq upto 12th order. For comparison we have also shown
the theoretical values computed directly from equation
(5). A model proposed by She and L´evˆeque [23] based
on a hierarchy of ﬂuctuation structures associated with
the vortex ﬁlaments is also shown for comparison. We
chose this particular model because of its remarkable
agreement with experimental data. The She and L´evˆeque
model predicts: ζq = q
3 . Figure 2b shows the
pdfs of the increments, which is quite similar to what is
observed in real turbulence – for large r the pdf is near
Gaussian while for smaller r it becomes more and more
peaked at the core with high tails (see also Figure 3 for
the variation of ﬂatness factors of increment pdfs with
distance r).

q

Our scheme could be easily extended for synthetic
passive-scalar (any diﬀusive component in a ﬂuid ﬂow
that has no dynamical eﬀect on the ﬂuid motion itself,
e.g., a pollutant in air, temperature in a weakly heated
ﬂow, a dye mixed in a turbulent jet or moisture mixing
in air [24, 25]) ﬁeld generation. The statistical and dy-
namical characteristics (anisotropy, intermittency, pdfs
etc.) of passive-scalars are surprisingly diﬀerent from
the underlying turbulent velocity ﬁeld [24, 25]. For
example, it is even possible for the passive-scalar ﬁeld
to exhibit intermittency in a purely Gaussian velocity

3

ﬁeld [24, 25]. Similar to the K41, neglecting intermit-
tency, the Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin (KOC) hypoth-
esis predicts that at high Reynolds and Peclet numbers,
the qth-order passive-scalar structure function will be-
have as: h|θ (x + r) − θ (x)|qi ∼ r
3 in the inertial range.
Experimental observations reveal that analogous to tur-
bulent velocity, passive-scalars also exhibit anomalous
scaling (departure from the KOC scaling). Observational
data also suggest that passive-scalar ﬁelds are much more
intermittent than velocity ﬁelds and result in stronger
anomaly [24, 25].

q

To generate synthetic passive-scalar ﬁelds, we need to
determine the stretching parameters d1 and d2 from pre-
scribed scaling exponents, ζq. Unlike the velocity scaling
exponents, the published values (based on experimental
observations) of higher-order passive-scalar scaling expo-
nents display signiﬁcant scatter. Thus for our purpose,
we used the predictions of a newly proposed passive-
q/2
8
scalar model [26]: ζq = 2+
.
9
This model based on the hierarchical structure theory of
(cid:0)
[23] shows reasonable agreement with the observed data.
Moreover, unlike other models, this model manages to
predict that the scaling exponent ζq is a nondecreasing
function of q. Theoretically, this is very crucial, because,
otherwise, if ζq → −∞ as q → +∞, the passive-scalar
ﬁeld cannot be bounded [12, 26].

Employing equation (5) and the scaling exponents
(upto 8th-order) predicted by the above model, we get
|dn| = 0.9644, 0.6060.
the following stretching factors:
As before, we found that only the combinations
(−0.9644, 0.6060), (0.6060, −0.9644), (−0.9644, −0.6060)
and (−0.6060, −0.9644) generate satisfactory ﬁelds.
We again repeated the previous numerical experi-
ment, now with the stretching parameter combination:
d1 = −0.9644 and d2 = 0.6060.
Like before, we
compared the estimated [using equation (4)] scaling
exponents from one hundred realizations with the theo-
retical values [from equation (5)] and the agreement was
found to be highly satisfactory. To check whether a gen-
erated passive-scalar ﬁeld (d1 = −0.9644, d2 = 0.6060)
possesses more non-Gaussian characteristics than its
velocity counterpart (d1 = −0.8868, d2 = 0.6763), we
performed a simple numerical experiment. We generated
both the velocity and passive-scalar ﬁelds from identical
anchor points and computed the corresponding ﬂatness
factors, K, as a function of distance r (see Figure 3).
Evidently,
stronger
the passive-scalar ﬁeld exhibits
non-Gaussian behavior than the velocity ﬁeld, in accord
with the literature.

In this paper, we proposed a simple yet eﬃcient scheme
to generate synthetic turbulent velocity and passive-
scalar ﬁelds. This method is competitive with most of
the other synthetic turbulence emulator schemes (e.g.,
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). As far as limitations, like other meth-
ods (except [3]) our proposed scheme cannot reproduce
the small-scale skewness behavior of velocity ﬁelds.
It
has been observed that in the inertial range the skew-
ness is approximately −0.3 to −0.4 (K41 predicts a value

of −0.28) and this small negative value is believed to
be the origin of vortex stretching and nonlinear energy
tranfer from large to small scales (a.k.a the energy cas-
cade) [3, 5]. On the positive side, the proposed method
could be easily implemented as a SGS model in LES fol-
lowing [6, 7]. Potentially, SGS models based on fractal
interpolation can address some of the unresolved issues
in LES: they can systematically account for the eﬀects
of near-wall proximity and atmospheric stability on the
SGS dynamics. Of course, this would require some kind
of universal dependence of the scaling exponents on both
wall-normal distance and stability. Quest for these kinds
of universality has began only recently [27, 28].

uous, dashed and dotted lines denote the K41, equation (5),
and the She-L´evˆeque model predictions respectively. The cir-
cles with error bars (one standard deviation) are estimated
values over one hundred realizations using d1 = −0.8868 and
d2 = 0.6763. Experimental data of Anselmet et al.’s [5] is also
shown for reference (star signs). (b) Pdfs of the normalized
increments of the multiaﬃne series. The plus signs denote
r = 2−14, while the circles refer to a distance r = 2−6. The
solid curve designates the Gaussian distribution for reference.

FIG. 3: The ﬂatness factors of the pdfs of the increments
of the velocity (circles) and passive-scalar ﬁeld (stars) as a
function of distance r. Note that both the ﬁelds approach the
Gaussian value of 3 only at large separation distances. Clearly
the passive-scalar ﬁeld is more non-Gaussian than the velocity
ﬁeld.

The unit of nonlinear interaction in Navier-Stokes and the Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equa-

tions is a wavenumber triad (k,p,q) satisfying k + p + q = 0. The expression for the combined

energy transfer from two of these wavenumbers to the third wavenumber is known. In this paper we

introduce the idea of an eﬀective energy transfer between a pair of modes through the mediation of

the third mode and then ﬁnd an expression for it. In ﬂuid turbulence, energy transfer takes place

between a pair of velocity modes, whereas in MHD turbulence energy transfer takes places between

(1) a pair of velocity modes, (2) a pair of magnetic modes, and (3) between a velocity and a magnetic

mode in a triad. In this paper we have obtained the expression for each of these transfers. We also

show how the eﬀective mode-to-mode energy transfer rate can be utilised to study energy cascades

and shell-to-shell energy transfer rates.

I. INTRODUCTION

In ﬂuid and MHD turbulence, eddies of various sizes interact amongst themselves; energy is exchanged among

them in this process. These interactions arise due to the nonlinearity present in these systems. The fundamental

interactions involve wavenumber triads (k,p,q) with k + p + q = 0.

The combined energy transfer computation to a mode from the other two modes of a triad has generally been

considered to be fundamental. This formalism has played an important role in furthering our understanding of locality

in ﬂuid turbulence [1–4], and also in analysing subgrid scale eddy viscosity [5,6]. Energy interactions are considered

to be local if the triads with k ∼ p ∼ q contribute most to the energy transfer to the wavenumber k. Numerical

simulations of Domaradzki and Rogallo [2,1] showed that the contribution of the nonlocal triads (k ∼ p >> q) to the

interactions is not small, but in such triads the dominant exchange of energy occurs between wavenumbers of similar

magnitudes, i.e., between k and p. Domaradzki et al.

[6] computed the sub-grid scale viscosity by summing up the

energy lost by a wavenumber k < kc (cut oﬀ wavenumber) by triad interactions with atleast one wavenumber larger

than kc. Batchelor [7] ﬁrst suggested a formula for the energy transfer in ﬂuid turbulence between two regions in

Fourier space, and Domaradzki and Rogallo [1] calculated shell-to-shell energy transfer rates. Taking energy transfer

between shells as an example, we will show in Section III, that these formalisms have certain limitations.

In this paper we present a scheme to calculate the energy transfer rates between two modes in a triad interaction.

Using our scheme we can calculate the energy transfer rates between two shells, cascade rates, and also study locality of

energy transfer. The formulae for the combined energy transfer rate were used to study energy transfer rates in MHD

turbulence [8–12]. Ishizawa and Hattori

[12] numerically computed the kinetic energy ﬂux to the velocity modes

outside the sphere and the magnetic energy ﬂuxes to the magnetic modes outside the sphere. They also computed

the kinetic energy ﬂuxes due to transfer of energy to all magnetic modes and a similar magnetic energy ﬂux due to

transfer of energy to all velocity modes [12]. Pouquet et al.

[9], Pouquet [10], and Ishizawa and Hattori

[11] used

the combined energy transfer formalism in an Eddy damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM) closure calculation

to study non-local energy transfer. However, several energy transfers cannot be calculated using these formalisms.

Our formalism of “mode-to-mode” transfer enables us to calculate all these energy transfer rates between the spheres

and the shells.

This paper is organized into the following sections. In Section II we will state the known results regarding the

2

combined energy transfer between velocity modes of a triad. In Section III we will present a discussion on the formulae

which are used for studying energy transfer between shells in ﬂuid turbulence. In Section IV we will formulate a way

of studying energy transfer between a pair of modes within a triad, with the third mode of the triad meditating

the transfer. This new method is used to re-deﬁne shell-to-shell transfer in Section V. The known results of energy

transfer in a MHD triad are discussed in Section VI and the “mode-to-mode” transfers in MHD in Section VII. The

results of Section VII are used in Section VIII to deﬁne shell-to-shell transfer rates and the energy cascade rates in

MHD turbulence. The conclusions of this paper follows in Section IX.

II. ENERGY TRANSFER IN A TRIAD: KNOWN RESULTS

The Navier Stokes equation in real space are written as

∂u
∂t

+ (u.∇)u = −∇p + ν∇2u,

(1)

where u is the velocity ﬁeld, and ν is the ﬂuid kinematic viscosity. In Fourier space, the kinetic energy equations for

a Fourier mode is

∂Eu(k)

∂t

+ 2νk2Eu(k) = X

k+p+q=0

1
2

Suu(k|p, q),

where Eu(k) ≡ |u(k)|2/2 is the kinetic energy in Fourier space for mode k. The nonlinear term Suu(k|p, q) is

Suu(k|p, q) ≡ −Re (i[k.u(q)][u(k).u(p)] + i[k.u(p)][u(k).u(q)])

(2)

(3)

This term represents the combined transfer of kinetic energy from mode p and q to mode k [13]. Note that the

wavenumber triad k, p, and q should satisfy the condition k + p + q = 0. This nonlinear term satisﬁes the following

conservation property

Suu(k|p, q) + Suu(p|k, q) + Suu(q|k, p) = 0.

(4)

While the quantity Suu(k|p, q) represents the nonlinear energy transfer from the two modes p and q to mode k, it

would be useful to know the exact energy transfer between any two modes, say from p to k. In Section IV we will

explore this idea.

III. SHELL-TO-SHELL ENERGY TRANSFER IN FLUID TURBULENCE

Using the combined energy transfer Suu(k|p, q), Domaradzki and Rogallo [1] have discussed energy transfer between

two shells. They interpret the quantity

T uu

mn =

1
2 X

kǫm

X

pǫn

Suu(k|p, q).

(5)

as the rate of energy transfer from shell n to shell m [1,7]. Note that k-sum is over shell m, p-sum over shell n,

and q = −k − p. However, Domaradzki and Rogallo [1] themselves points out that it may not be entirely correct to

interpret the formula (5) as the shell-to-shell energy transfer. The reason for this is as follows:

In the energy transfer between two shells m and n, two types of wavenumber triads are involved (see Fig. 1 shown

below). In a triad of type I, the wavenumbers p, q are located in one shell, and k is located in the other. In a type

II triad, wavenumber k is in one shell, p or q in the other shell, and the third wavenumber is located outside the

two shells. In Eq. (5) the summation is carried over both kinds of triads. However, it is easy to see that the energy

transfer from shell n to shell m takes place through both the k-p and k-q legs of triad I but only through the k-p

leg of triad II. Hence Batchelor’s and Domaradzki’s formalism do not yield correct shell-to-shell energy transfers (as

was pointed out by Batchelor and Domaradzki themselves).

IV. MODE-TO-MODE ENERGY TRANSFER IN A TRIAD

The nonlinear interaction in the Navier-Stokes and the MHD equations are intrinsically three-mode interactions.

The expression for the energy transfer to one mode of the triad from the other two was presented in Section II.

In this section we shall explore the possibility of obtaining an expression for the energy transfer between any two

modes within a triad — we will call it the mode-to-mode transfer. We emphasize that this approach is still within the

framework of the triad interaction — that is, the triad is still the fundamental interaction of which the mode-to-mode

transfer is a part. The energy transfer between two modes of a triad by the mediation of the third mode is sought

here.

We shall ﬁrst consider only the Navier-Stokes equation. In a later section, the discussion will be generalised to the

MHD equation.

4

A. Deﬁnition of Mode-to-Mode transfer in a triad

Consider a triad k, p, q. Let the quantity R/ uu(k|p|q) denote the energy transferred from mode p to mode k with

mode q playing the role of a mediator (see Fig. 2). We wish to obtain an expression for R/ uu.

The R/ uu’s should satisfy the following relationships :

1. The sum of R/ uu(k|p|q) and R/ uu(k|q|p), which represent energy transfer from mode p to mode k and from

mode q to mode k, respectively, should be equal to the total energy transferred to mode k from modes p and

q, i.e., Suu(k|p, q) [see Eq. (3)]. Thus,

R/ uu(k|p|q) + R/ uu(k|q|p) = Suu(k|p, q),

R/ uu(p|k|q) + R/ uu(p|q|k) = Suu(p|k, q),

R/ uu(q|k|p) + R/ uu(q|p|k) = Suu(q|k, p).

(6)

(7)

(8)

2. The energy transferred from mode p to mode k, i.e., R/ uu(k|p|q), will be equal and opposite to the energy

transferred from mode k to mode p i.e., R/ uu(p|k|q). Thus,

R/ uu(k|p|q) + R/ uu(p|k|q) = 0,

R/ uu(k|q|p) + R/ uu(q|k|p) = 0,

R/ uu(p|q|k) + R/ uu(q|p|k) = 0.

(9)

(10)

(11)

These are six equations with six unknowns. However, the value of the determinant formed from the Eqs. (6)-(11)

is zero. Therefore we cannot ﬁnd unique R/ uu’s given just these equations. However, it is reasonable to expect that

there is a deﬁnite amount of energy transfer from one mode to the other mode, say from mode k to mode p given

u(k), u(p), u(q). Since Eqs. (6)-(11) do not yield a unique R/ uu, we need to use constraints based on invariance,

symmetries, etc. to get a deﬁnite R/ uu using Eqs. (6)-(11).

5

B. Solutions of equations of mode-to-mode transfer

One solution of Eqs. (6)-(11) is

S/ uu(k|p|q) ≡ −Re (i[k.u(q)][u(k).u(p)]) ,

From the deﬁnition of S/ uu(k|p|q), it directly follows that S/ uu’s satisfy the following conditions.

S/ uu(k|p|q) + S/ uu(k|q|p) = Suu(k|p, q),

S/ uu(p|k|q) + S/ uu(p|q|k) = Suu(p|k, q),

S/ uu(q|k|p) + S/ uu(q|p|k) = Suu(q|k, p).

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

Using the triad relationship k + p + q = 0, and the incompressibility constraint [k.u(k) = 0], it can be seen that

S/ uu’s, etc. also satisfy the following conditions

S/ uu(k|p|q) + S/ uu(p|k|q) = 0,

S/ uu(k|q|p) + S/ uu(q|k|p) = 0,

S/ uu(p|q|k) + S/ uu(q|p|k) = 0.

(16)

(17)

(18)

Comparing Eqs. (13)-(18) with Eqs. (6)-(11), it is clear that the set of S/ uu’s is one instance of the R/ uu’s, i.e.,

R/ uu(k|p|q) = S/ uu(k|p|q). However, this is not a unique solution.

If another solution R/ uu(k|p|q) diﬀers from S/ uu(k|p|q) by an arbitrary function X∆, i.e., R/ uu(k|p|q) = S/ uu(k|p|q)+

X∆, then by inspection we can easily see that every possible solution of Eqs. (6)-(11) must be of the form

R/ uu(k|p|q) = S/ uu(k|p|q) + X∆

R/ uu(k|q|p) = S/ uu(k|q|p) − X∆

R/ uu(p|k|q) = S/ uu(p|k|q) − X∆

R/ uu(p|q|k) = S/ uu(p|q|k) + X∆

6

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

R/ uu(q|k|p) = S/ uu(q|k|p) + X∆

R/ uu(q|p|k) = S/ uu(q|p|k) − X∆

(23)

(24)

Note that X∆ can depend upon the wavenumber triad k, p, q, and the Fourier components u(k), u(p), u(q). X∆

needs to be determined from other symmetry and invariance arguments to uniquely ﬁx R/ uu.

In Appendix A we have attempted to determine X∆. We construct X∆ by observing that it can depend on k, p,

q, u(k), u(p), u(q); and it must satisfy rotational invariance, galilean invariance, and it should be ﬁnite. In our

procedure we write down a general scalar function of k, p, q, u(k), u(p), and u(q) with undetermined coeﬃcients.

The coeﬃcients can be written as a series in the scalars of the type k.p, k.u(p), u(k).u(p) with unknown constants.

By imposing invariance,and ﬁniteness constraints we have shown that, upto the linear order in these scalars, the

coeﬃcients must vanish, giving X∆ = 0. Unfortunately, we have not been able to determine the higher order

coeﬃcients. Hence, from the analysis of Appendix A we cannot show that X∆ will deﬁnitely vanish. However, if

X∆ = 0 we get a simple relationship,

R/ uu = S/ uu,

(25)

giving the energy transfer between a pair of modes in a triad with the third mode mediating the transfer, as simply

S/ uu. But if X∆ 6= 0 then the energy transfer picture is more complex and the energy transfer between a pair of modes

will be given by Eqs. (19)-(24) where X∆ is unknown. However, even if X∆ is unknown we can obtain very relevant

information from the S/ uu’s as is shown below.

We will now give a physical interpretation to the two parts of R/ uu’s, i.e., S/ uu’s and X∆. We now see from Fig. 3

that S/ uu(k|p|q) + X∆ gets transferred from p to k, S/ uu(q|k|p) + X∆ gets transferred from k to q, S/ uu(p|q|k) + X∆

gets transferred from q to p. The quantity X∆ ﬂows along p → k → q → p, circulating around the entire triad

without changing the energy of any of the modes. Therefore we will call it the Circulating transfer. Of the total

energy transfer between two modes, S/ uu + X∆, only S/ uu can bring about a change in modal energy. X∆ transferred

from mode p to mode k is transferred back to mode p via mode q, i.e., the mode p transfers X∆ directly to mode k,

and mode p transfers X∆ back to k indirectly through mode q. Thus the energy that is eﬀectively transferred from

mode p to mode k is just S/ uu(k|p|q). Therefore S/ uu(k|p|q) can be be termed as the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer

from mode p to mode k.

7

In summary, we have attempted to obtain an expression for the energy transfer rate R/ uu between two modes in

a triad. To leading order in a series expansion, we can show that R/ uu = S/ uu. But the ambiguity in R/ uu remains

because of the lack of a complete proof. However, the important conclusion is that the mode-to-mode energy transfer

can be expressed as R/ uu = S/ uu + X∆ where S/ uu is the ‘eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer’ and X∆ is the ‘circulating

transfer’. In the next section we will further develop the notion of eﬀective transfers by applying it to energy transfer

between shells.

V. SHELL-TO-SHELL ENERGY TRANSFER AND CASCADE RATES USING “MODE-TO-MODE”

FORMALISM

In Section III we had pointed out the problem in treating the expression in Eq. (5) as the shell-to-shell transfer.

This expression, commonly taken to be the shell-to-shell transfer, actually gives the energy transferred to shell m from

both shell n and the modes q of type II triads (see Fig. 1). In this section we will make use of the idea of “circulating”

and “eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer” to redeﬁne shell-to-shell transfer.

Consider energy transfer between shells m and n in Fig. 4 . The mode k is in shell m, the mode p is in shell n, and

q could be inside or outside the shells. In terms of the mode-to-mode transfer R/ uu(k|p|q) from mode p to mode k,

the energy transfer from shell n to shell m can be deﬁned as

mn = X
T uu

kǫm

X

pǫn

R/ uu(k|p|q)

(26)

where the k-sum is over shell m, p-sum is over shell n, and k+p+q=0. The quantity R/ uu can be written as a sum

of an eﬀective transfer S/ uu(k|p|q) and a circulating transfer X∆. We know from the last section that the circulating

transfer does not contribute to the energy change of modes. From Fig. 4 we can see that X∆ ﬂows from shell m to

shell n and then ﬂows back to m indirectly through the mode q. Therefore the eﬀective energy transfer from shell m

to shell n is just S/ uu(k|p|q) summed over all k in shell m and all p in shell n, i.e.,

mn = X
T uu

kǫm

X

pǫn

S/ uu(k|p|q),

(27)

where S/ uu(k|p|q) is the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer.

If X∆ = 0 then the eﬀective energy transfer between two shells given by this equation will be the same as the same

as the total energy transfer between them given by Eq. (26). However, we have argued earlier that the circulating

8

transfer does not result in the energy change of any of the modes. Hence, from the physical point of view the eﬀective

shell-to-shell transfer is a very relevant quantity to study.

In a subsequent paper we have studied the eﬀective

shell-to-shell transfers in numerical simulations.

A. Energy cascade rates

The kinetic energy cascade rate (Π) (or ﬂux) in ﬂuid turbulence is deﬁned as the rate of loss of kinetic energy by

a sphere in k-space to the modes outside. In literature, the energy ﬂux in ﬂuid turbulence has been computed using

Suu(k|p, q) [14,15]. Kraichnan [15] shows by direct integration of Eq. (2) that the kinetic energy lost from a sphere

of radius K by nonlinear convective transfers is

Π(K) = − X

|k|<K

1
2

X

|p|>K

Suu(k|p, q).

(28)

Although the energy cascade rate in ﬂuid turbulence can be found by the above formula, the mode-to-mode approach

provides a more natural way of looking at the energy transfers.

In later sections we will obtain expressions for

mode-to-mode transfer in MHD turbulence and deﬁne various ﬂuxes which are not accessible to the conventional

approach. Here, we will obtain an expression for the ﬂux in terms of the eﬀective mode-to-mode energy transfer.

Since R/ uu(k|p|q) represents energy transfer from p to k with q as the mediator, we may alternatively write the

energy loss from a sphere as

Π(K) = − X

|k|<K

X

|p|>K

R/ uu(k|p|q).

(29)

where mode k is inside the sphere, p is outside the sphere, and q = −k − p. The mode-to-mode transfer R/ uu(k|p|q)

consists of a circulating part and an eﬀective part. From Fig. 5 we see that the net amount of circulating transfer

leaving the sphere is zero. Thus the circulating transfer makes no contribution to the the energy ﬂux from the sphere.

Therefore, it can be removed from Eq. (29) and the resultant expression for the ﬂux can be written as

Π(K) = − X

|k|<K

X

|p|>K

S/ uu(k|p|q).

(30)

with a summation over the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer. The expressions in Eqs. (28) and (30) are equivalent as

is formally proved in Appendix B.

where Eu(k) = |u(k)|2/2 is the kinetic energy, and Eb(k) = |b(k)|2/2 is the magnetic energy. The four nonlinear

terms Suu(k|p, q), Sub(k|p, q) Sbb(k|p, q) and Sbu(k|p, q) are

Suu(k|p, q) ≡ −Re (i[k.u(q)][u(k).u(p)] + i[k.u(p)][u(k).u(q)]) ,

Sbb(k|p, q) ≡ −Re (i[k.u(q)][b(k).b(p)] + i[k.u(p)][b(k).b(q)]) ,

Sub(k|p, q) ≡ Re (i[k.b(q)][u(k).b(p)] + i[k.b(p)][u(k).b(q)]) ,

Sbu(k|p, q) ≡ Re (i[k.b(q)][b(k).u(p)] + i[k.b(p)][b(k).u(q)]) .

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

These terms are conventionally taken to represent the nonlinear transfer from modes p and q to mode k [16,13] of a

triad such that k + p + q = 0. The term Suu(k|p, q) represents the net transfer of kinetic energy from modes p and

q to mode k. Likewise the term Sub(k|p, q) is the net magnetic energy transferred from modes p and q to the kinetic

energy in mode k, whereas Sbu(k|p, q) is the net kinetic energy transferred from modes p and q to the magnetic

energy in mode k. The term Sbb(k|p, q) represents the transfer of magnetic energy from modes p and q to mode k.

All these transfer terms are represented in the Fig. 6.

10

Stanisic [16] showed that the nonlinear terms satisfy the following detailed conservation properties:

Suu(k|p, q) + Suu(p|k, q) + Suu(q|k, p) = 0,

Sbb(k|p, q) + Sbb(p|k, q) + Sbb(q|k, p) = 0,

(39)

(40)

and

Sub(k|p, q) + Sub(p|k, q) + Sub(q|k, p) + Sbu(k|p, q) + Sbu(p|k, q) + Sbu(q|k, p) = 0.

(41)

The Eq. (39) implies that kinetic energy is transferred conservatively between the velocity modes of a wavenumber

triad, and the Eq. (40) implies that magnetic energy is also transferred conservatively between the magnetic modes

of a wavenumber triad. The Eq. (41) implies that the cross transfers of kinetic and magnetic energy, Sub(k|p, q) and

Sbu(k|p, q), within a triad are also energy conserving.

The quantities Suu(k|p, q), Sub(k|p, q), Sbb(k|p, q), and Sbu(k|p, q) represent the nonlinear energy transfer from

the two modes p and q to mode k. It would be useful to know the energy transfer between any two modes, say from

p to k. This issue will be explored in the next section.

VII. “MODE-TO-MODE” ENERGY TRANSFERS IN MHD EQUATIONS

In Section IV we had presented a new approach to describe the energy transfer between two velocity modes of a

triad mediated by the third velocity mode, in the Navier-Stokes equation. In the same spirit we will now attempt

to ﬁnd the mode-to-mode energy transfers in MHD. In MHD turbulence there will be three kinds of mode-to-mode

transfer within a wavenumber triad k, p, q: kinetic energy transfer from u(p) to u(k); magnetic energy transfer from

b(p) to b(k); and transfer of kinetic energy from u(p) to magnetic energy in b(k). We denote these three transfers

by R/ uu(k|p|q), R/ bb(k|p|q), and R/ bu(k|p|q) respectively, where the index q indicates that the energy transfer between

modes p and k is mediated by the mode q. Since the nonlinear interactions fundamentally involve three-modes, the

energy transfer between a pair of modes should depend on the third mode. The mode-to-mode transfers R/ uu, R/ bb,

and R/ bu are schematically illustrated in Fig. 7.

In this section we will obtain a description for each of these transfers.

11

A. Velocity mode to velocity mode energy transfers

In Section IV we discussed the mode-to-mode transfer, R/ uu, between velocity modes in ﬂuid ﬂows. In this section

we will ﬁnd R/ uu for MHD ﬂows. The transfer of kinetic energy between the velocity modes is brought about by the

term (u.∇)u, both in the Navier Stokes and MHD equations. Hence, the expression for the combined kinetic energy

transfer to a mode from the other two modes of the triad is also same for the two. i.e., the combined transfer to u(k)

from u(p) and u(q) is given by Suu(k|p, q) [see Eqs. (3) and (35)]. Consequently, R/ uu ’s for MHD will satisfy the

constraints given in Eqs. (6)-(11) for the corresponding R/ uu ’s for ﬂuids. As a result, R/ uu(k|p, q) in MHD can be

expressed as a sum of a circulating transfer X∆ and the eﬀective transfer S/ uu(k|p|q) given by Eq. (12), i.e.,

R/ uu(k|p|q) = S/ uu(k|p|q) + X∆

(42)

The arguments are the same as those presented in Section IV B for ﬂuid turbulence.

B. Magnetic mode to Magnetic mode energy transfers

Now we consider the magnetic energy transfer from mode b(p) to b(k) in the triad (k,p,q) [see Fig. 7]. This

transfer which is denoted by R/ bb(k|p|q), should satisfy the following relationships :

1. The sum of the mode-to-mode energy transfers from b(p) to b(k) and from b(q) to b(k) should be equal to

Sbb(k|p, q) [Eq. (36) in Section VI], which is the combined energy transfer to b(k) from b(p) and b(q). Thus,

R/ bb(k|p|q) + R/ bb(k|q|p) = Sbb(k|p, q),

R/ bb(p|k|q) + R/ bb(p|q|k) = Sbb(p|k, q),

R/ bb(q|k|p) + R/ bb(q|p|k) = Sbb(q|k, p).

(43)

(44)

(45)

2. the energy transfer from b(k) to b(p), R/ bb(k|p|q), and the transfer from b(p) to b(k), R/ bb(p|k|q), should be

equal but opposite in sign. That is,

R/ bb(k|p|q) + R/ bb(p|k|q) = 0,

R/ bb(k|q|p) + R/ bb(q|k|p) = 0,

12

(46)

(47)

R/ bb(p|q|k) + R/ bb(q|p|k) = 0.

(48)

Once again, the above equations cannot uniquely determine R/ bb(k|p|q) since the value of the determinant formed

from these equations is zero. While discussing the mode-to-mode energy transfers in Navier Stokes equation in

Section IV we got the same result for R/ uu(k|p|q). Following the reasoning in Section IV, we can extract physically

meaningful information from Eqs. (43)-(48).

The combined energy transfer to b(k) from b(p) and b(q) is given by Eq. (36) of Section VI. We denote the ﬁrst

term on the right hand side of that equation by S/ bb(k|p|q), i.e.,

S/ bb(k|p|q) ≡ −Re (i[k.u(q)][b(k).b(p)]) ,

(49)

By replacing S/ bb(k|p|q) for R/ bb(k|p|q) in Eqs. (43)-(48) we ﬁnd that S/ bb(k|p|q) is a solution of these equations, i.e.,

and

S/ bb(k|p|q) + S/ bb(k|q|p) = Sbb(k|p, q),

S/ bb(p|k|q) + S/ bb(p|q|k) = Sbb(p|k, q),

S/ bb(q|k|p) + S/ bb(q|p|k) = Sbb(q|k, p).

S/ bb(k|p|q) + S/ bb(p|k|q) = 0,

S/ bb(k|q|p) + S/ bb(q|k|p) = 0,

S/ bb(p|q|k) + S/ bb(q|p|k) = 0.

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

Thus, S/ bb(k|p|q) is a solution of the equations

(43)—(48). By inspection it can be seen that all solutions of the

equations can be expressed as

R/ bb(k|p|q) = S/ bb(k|p|q) + Y∆,

R/ bb(k|q|p) = S/ bb(k|q|p) − Y∆,

R/ bb(p|k|q) = S/ bb(p|k|q) − Y∆,

13

(56)

(57)

(58)

R/ bb(p|q|k) = S/ bb(p|q|k) + Y∆,

R/ bb(q|k|p) = S/ bb(q|k|p) + Y∆,

R/ bb(q|p|k) = S/ bb(q|p|k) − Y∆,

(59)

(60)

(61)

where Y∆ is an arbitrary scalar function dependent on the wavenumber triad k, p, q and the Fourier components

u(k), u(p), u(q), b(k), b(p), b(q) at those wavenumbers. To determine the unique form of this function we

need to impose additional constraints, similar to those imposed on X∆ in Appendix A for determining mode-to-mode

energy transfer between velocity modes in ﬂuid turbulence (see Section IV B). The arguments for determination of

Y∆ is given in Appendix B.

The solutions in Eqs. (56)-(61) have been schematically illustrated in Fig. 8. We see from the ﬁgure that Y∆ is

transferred from b(p) → b(k) → b(q) → and back to b(p), i.e., it circulates around the triad without causing any

change in modal energy — it is a thus a circulating transfer. The magnetic energy eﬀectively transferred from b(p)

to b(k) is just S/ bb(k|p|q)1,i.e.,

R/ bb

ef f (k|p|q) = S/ bb(k|p|q).

(62)

The eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer S/ bb(k|p|q) from b(p) to b(k) is mediated by the velocity mode u(q).

In the next section we will use R/ bb

ef f to calculate eﬀective energy transfer rate between the magnetic modes inside

two shells and the eﬀective cascade rate of magnetic energy.

C. Velocity mode to Magnetic mode energy transfers

In Section VII A and Section VII B we discussed mode-to-mode energy transfer between a pair of velocity modes

and between a pair of magnetic modes in a wavenumber triad, respectively. We now consider the energy transfer

between u(p) and b(k), R/ ub(k|p|q), within the triad (k, p, q) illustrated in Fig. 7 . We will follow the same

sequence of steps as in the two sections VII A and VII B.

R/ ub ’s will satisfy the following relationships:

1the idea of circulating transfer and eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer in a triad was introduced in Section IV B — a detailed

discussion can be found in that section.

14

1. Since R/ ub(k|p|q) and R/ ub(k|q|p) are the mode-to-mode energy transfers from b(p) to u(k) and from b(q) to

u(k), the sum of the two should be equal to Sub(k|p, q), the combined energy transfer to u(k) from b(p) and

b(q). Therefore, we get

R/ ub(k|p|q) + R/ ub(k|q|p) = Sub(k|p, q),

R/ ub(p|k|q) + R/ ub(p|q|k) = Sub(p|k, q),

R/ ub(q|k|p) + R/ ub(q|p|k) = Sub(q|k, p).

R/ bu(k|p|q) + R/ bu(k|q|p) = Sbu(k|p, q),

R/ bu(p|k|q) + R/ bu(p|q|k) = Sbu(p|k, q),

R/ bu(q|k|p) + R/ bu(q|p|k) = Sbu(q|k, p).

(63)

(64)

(65)

(66)

(67)

(68)

2. R/ ub(k|p|q) denotes the energy transfer from b(p) to u(k). R/ bu(p|k|q) is physically the same transfer but seen

as a transfer from u(k) to b(p). Therefore,

R/ ub(k|p|q) + R/ bu(p|k|q) = 0,

R/ ub(k|q|p) + R/ bu(q|k|p) = 0,

R/ ub(p|q|k) + R/ bu(q|p|k) = 0.

R/ bu(k|p|q) + R/ ub(p|k|q) = 0,

R/ bu(k|q|p) + R/ ub(q|k|p) = 0,

R/ bu(p|q|k) + R/ ub(q|p|k) = 0.

15

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

(74)

The solutions of these equations are not unique and the expression for the energy transfer between modes cannot

be obtained from the above equations alone. As in sections IV and VII A, we will now explore the solutions of the

above equations.

We deﬁne the following quantities :

S/ ub(k|p|q) ≡ −Re (i[k.b(q)][u(k).b(p)]) ,

S/ bu(k|p|q) ≡ −Re (i[k.b(q)][b(k).u(p)]) ,

(75)

(76)

Replacing S/ ub and S/ bu for R/ ub and R/ bu respectively in Eqs. (63)-(74) we ﬁnd that the S/ ’s are a solution to those

equations, i.e.,

S/ ub(k|p|q) + S/ ub(k|q|p) = Sub(k|p, q),

S/ ub(p|k|q) + S/ ub(p|q|k) = Sub(p|k, q),

S/ ub(q|k|p) + S/ ub(q|p|k) = Sub(q|k, p).

S/ bu(k|p|q) + S/ bu(k|q|p) = Sbu(k|p, q),

S/ bu(p|k|q) + S/ bu(p|q|k) = Sbu(p|k, q),

S/ bu(q|k|p) + S/ bu(q|p|k) = Sbu(q|k, p),

S/ ub(k|p|q) + S/ bu(p|k|q) = 0,

S/ ub(k|q|p) + S/ bu(q|k|p) = 0,

S/ ub(p|q|k) + S/ bu(q|p|k) = 0,

S/ bu(k|p|q) + S/ ub(p|k|q) = 0,

16

and

(77)

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

(83)

(84)

(85)

(86)

S/ bu(k|q|p) + S/ ub(q|k|p) = 0,

S/ bu(p|q|k) + S/ ub(q|p|k) = 0.

(87)

(88)

The S/ ub ’s are just a single instance of the the R/ ub’s. It can be seen by inspection that all solutions can be expressed

in the form :

R/ bu(k|p|q) = S/ bu(k|p|q) + Z∆,

R/ bu(k|q|p) = S/ bu(k|q|p) − Z∆,

R/ bu(p|k|q) = S/ bu(p|k|q) − Z∆,

R/ bu(p|q|k) = S/ bu(p|q|k) + Z∆,

R/ bu(q|k|p) = S/ bu(q|k|p) + Z∆,

R/ bu(q|p|k) = S/ bu(q|p|k) − Z∆,

R/ ub(k|p|q) = S/ ub(k|p|q) + Z∆,

R/ ub(k|q|p) = S/ ub(k|q|p) − Z∆,

R/ ub(p|k|q) = S/ ub(p|k|q) − Z∆,

R/ ub(p|q|k) = S/ ub(p|q|k) + Z∆,

R/ ub(q|k|p) = S/ ub(q|k|p) + Z∆,

(89)

(90)

(91)

(92)

(93)

(94)

(95)

(96)

(97)

(98)

(99)

R/ ub(q|p|k) = S/ ub(q|p|k) − Z∆,

(100)

where Z∆ is an arbitrary function dependent on k, p, q, u(k), u(p), u(q), b(k), b(p), b(q). These solutions are

pictorially represented in Fig. 9 below.

17

We are already familiar with such solutions from the earlier discussions. From Fig. 9 we see that Z∆ transfers

energy from u(p) → b(k) → u(q) → b(p) → u(k) → b(q) → and back to u(p) without resulting in a change in modal

energy. Hence, following the discussions in Section VII A and Section VII B, we can interpret the quantity Z∆ as a

circulating transfer. The S/ bu can be interpreted as the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfers. For example, S/ bu(k|p|q) is

the eﬀective transfer from u(p) to b(k),i.e,

R/ bu

ef f (k|p|q) = S/ bu(k|p|q),

(101)

which is mediated by the magnetic mode b(q).

In the next section, we will use the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer to deﬁne, (a) shell-to-shell transfers between

the velocity and the magnetic modes, and (b) cascade rates between the velocity and the magnetic modes.

VIII. SHELL-TO-SHELL ENERGY TRANSFER AND CASCADE RATES IN MHD TURBULENCE

In this section, we will extend the formulation of Section V to deﬁne shell-to-shell transfer rates and cascade rates

in MHD turbulence.

We shall use the term u-shell and u-sphere respectively to denote a shell and a sphere in k-space containing velocity

modes, and b-shell and b-sphere for the corresponding magnetic modes.

A. Shell-to-Shell energy transfer rates

In Section V we had deﬁned the eﬀective shell-to-shell transfer rates between two u-shells in Fourier space. The

expression for the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer between two velocity modes is the same for both Fluid and MHD

ﬂows [see Section IV B and VII A]. Hence, the eﬀective shell-to-shell transfer rates between two u-shells in MHD will

also be deﬁned by Eq. (27) of Section V, i.e.,

mn = X
T uu

kǫm

X

pǫn

S/ uu(k|p|q).

(102)

Similarly, the quantity R/ bb(k|p|q) gives the energy transfer rate from b(p) to b(k), mediated by q. Hence the

energy transfer rate from nth b-shell to the mth b-shell can be obtained by summing R/ bb(k|p|q) over every p in the

the nth b-shell and over every k in the mth b-shell. From Section VII B we know that R/ bb = S/ bb(k|p|q) + Y∆, where

S/ bb(k|p|q) is the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer from b(p) to b(k), and Y∆ is a circulating transfer. Thus, Y∆ is

18

transferred from b(p) in shell n to b(k) in shell m and then back to b(p) via the mode b(q). Therefore, the eﬀective

shell-to-shell transfer transfer rate from the nth to the mth b-shell is

mn = X
T bb

kǫm

X

pǫn

S/ bb(k|p|q).

(103)

We can now also deﬁne shell-to-shell transfers rates between a u-shell and a b-shell. R/ bu(k|p|q) is the energy transfer

rate from u(p) to b(k) mediated by mode q. Hence the energy transfer rate from the the nth u-shell to the mth b-shell

can be calculated by summing R/ bu(k|p|q) over every p in the nth u-shell and over every k in mth b-shell. We have

shown in Section VII C that R/ bu(k|p|q) = S/ bu(k|p|q) + Z∆, where S/ bu(k|p|q) is the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer

from the mode u(p) to the mode b(k) in the triad k, p, q, and Z∆ is the circulating transfer which is transferred along

u(p) → b(k) → u(q) → b(p) → u(k) → b(q) → u(p). Hence, Z∆ is transferred from the mode u(p) in shell n to

b(k) in shell m and then ﬂows back to u(p) via the modes u(q) → b(p) → u(k) → b(q) → u(p) → u(p). Therefore,

we interpret the quantity obtained by summing S/ bu(k|p|q) over every p in the nth u-shell and every k in the mth

b-shell as the eﬀective shell-to-shell transfer. That is,

is the eﬀective transfer from the the nth u-shell to the mth b-shell. The energy transfer rate from the nth b-shell to

mn = X
T bu

kǫm

X

pǫn

S/ bu(k|p|q)

(104)

the mth u-shell, T ub

mn = −T bu
mn.

In Appendix A-C, we have argued that the circulating transfer X∆ = 0, Y∆ = 0, and Z∆ = 0 to the ﬁrst order in

the expansion coeﬃcients. If X∆ = 0, Y∆ = 0, Z∆ = 0, then the eﬀective shell-to-shell transfers will be the same as

the total shell-to-shell transfers. However, we had pointed out is Section V that the circulating transfer, if nonzero,

does not contribute to a change in energy of any shell, and hence from the physical point of view the eﬀective shell-

to-shell transfers is of greater signiﬁcance than the total shell-to-shell transfers. We have numerically computed the

eﬀective shell-to-shell transfers given by Eqs. (102)-(104) in numerical simulations of 2-D MHD turbulence and gained

important insights into the energy transfer process. The results of the simulations will be discussed in a companion

paper [17].

B. Energy cascade rates

There are various types of cascade rates (energy ﬂuxes) in MHD turbulence. We have schematically shown these

transfers in Fig. 10. In this section we will derive the formulae to calculate these cascade rates within the framework

19

of eﬀective transfers.

In Section V A, we derived an expression for kinetic energy ﬂux in terms of the mode-to-mode transfer [Eq. (26)].

We showed that the circulating transfer X∆ does not contribute to the ﬂux. Hence, the kinetic energy ﬂux can be

expressed by Eq. (30) in terms of the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer S/ uu(k|p|q). The kinetic energy ﬂux Πu<

u> (the

energy transfer rate from the u-sphere to outside the same sphere) in MHD will also be given by the same equation,

i.e.,

u>(K) = X
Πu<

|p|<K

X

|k|>K

S/ uu(k|p|q).

(105)

The magnetic energy ﬂux Πb<

b>(K) is deﬁned as the rate of energy lost by the b-sphere to the modes outside the

b-sphere. Since R/ bb(k|p|q) is the mode-to-mode transfer from b(p) to b(k), Πb<

b>(K) can be obtained by summing

R/ bb(k|p|q) over every mode p inside the b-sphere and every mode k outside the b-sphere, i.e.,

b>(K) = X
Πb<

|p|<K

X

|k|>K

R/ bb(k|p|q).

(106)

As in the kinetic energy ﬂux, the circulating transfer Y∆ will not contribute to the magnetic energy ﬂux in Eq. (106).

We brieﬂy explain this as follows: let us take the mode b(q) to be outside the b-sphere. Then if the mode b(k) loses

Y∆ to mode b(p) then it will also gain Y∆ from mode b(q), and hence Y∆ will not contribute to the magnetic energy

ﬂux. Similar arguments apply when b(q) is inside the b-sphere. Therefore, we can write the magnetic energy ﬂux in

Eq. (106) as

b>(K) = X
Πb<

|p|<K

X

|k|>K

S/ bb(k|p|q).

(107)

where S/ bb(k|p|q) is given by Eq. (49) of Section VII B.

Similarly, the energy transfer between the kinetic energy and magnetic energy can be described by four types of

ﬂuxes. We shall deﬁne these ﬂuxes below.

There is a transfer of energy from a u-sphere of radius K to the b-sphere of the same radius. The rate of loss of

energy from the u-sphere to the corresponding b-sphere can be calculated by by summing R/ bu(k|p|q) over every mode

inside the b-sphere and the u-sphere. Following the deﬁnition of the eﬀective shell-to-shell transfer T bu

mn we can deﬁne

the eﬀective ﬂux from the u-sphere to the b-sphere as

b< (K) = X
Πu<

|p|<K

X

|k|<K

S/ bu(k|p|q).

20

(108)

by summing the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer, S/ bu(k|p|q), from u(p) to b(k), over the modes inside the u-sphere

and the b-sphere.

There is a transfer of energy from the u-sphere to the magnetic modes outside the corresponding b-sphere. The rate

of loss of the the energy from the u-sphere to the modes outside the b-sphere can be obtained by summing R/ bu(k|p|q)

over every mode inside the u-sphere and every mode outside the b-sphere. The corresponding eﬀective ﬂux can be

calculated using

b> (K) = X
Πu<

|p|<K

X

|k|>K

S/ bu(k|p|q).

(109)

Similarly, there is a transfer of magnetic energy from a b-sphere to velocity modes outside the u-sphere. The rate

of loss of energy from the b-sphere to the modes outside the u-sphere can be calculated by

u>(K) = X
Πb<

|p|<K

X

|k|>K

S/ ub(k|p|q).

(110)

There is a transfer of energy from modes outside the u-sphere to the modes outside the b-sphere. The rate of loss

of energy by the modes outside the u-sphere to the modes outside the b-sphere can be obtained by

b> (K) = X
Πu>

|p|>K

X

|k|>K

S/ bu(k|p|q).

(111)

The total eﬀective ﬂux is deﬁned as the total energy (kinetic+magnetic) lost by the K-sphere to the modes outside,

i.e.,

Πtot(K) = Πu<

u>(K) + Πb<

b>(K) + Πu<

b> (K) + Πb<

u>(K).

(112)

A schematic illustration of the eﬀective ﬂuxes deﬁned in Eqs. (105)-(111) was given in Fig. 10. If the circulating

transfer is zero, then each of the eﬀective ﬂuxes will be the same as the corresponding total ﬂuxes. In a subsequent

paper we will present the results of the detailed study of these ﬂuxes in numerical simulations of 2-D MHD turbulence.

IX. CONCLUSION

In literature we ﬁnd a description of energy transfer rates from two modes in a triad to the third mode, i.e., from

u(p) and u(q) to u(k). Here we have constructed new formulae to describe energy transfer rates between a pair of

modes in the triad (mode-to-mode transfer), say from u(p) to u(k). The third mode in the triad acts as a mediator

in the transfer process.

21

The mode-to-mode energy transfer in our formalism can be expressed as a combination of an “eﬀective transfer”

and a “circulating transfer”. In Appendices A-C we have shown by imposing galilean invariance, symmetry and some

other constraints that the circulating transfer should be zero. A completely general proof is not available at present.

However even if the circulating transfer happens to be nonzero, it will not result in a change of modal energy, since

the amount of circulating transfer gained by mode k from mode p is also lost by mode k to mode q (see Figs. 3, 8,

9). Only the eﬀective transfer is responsible for modal energy change. As the circulating transfer does not have any

observable eﬀect on the energy of the modes, it may be correct to ignore it from the study of energy transfer.

Using the notion of eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer and the circulating transfer we deﬁned eﬀective shell-to-shell

energy transfer rates and energy ﬂuxes in ﬂuid turbulence [see Eq. (27) and Eq. (30)] and in MHD turbulence [see

Eqs. (102)-(104) and Eqs. (105)-(111)]. Some of these energy transfers can be obtained only using the “mode-to-mode”

energy transfer formulae. In a companion paper [17] we present the results of our numerical study of the eﬀective

shell-to-shell energy transfer rates and energy ﬂuxes in 2-D MHD turbulence.

22

APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF THE CIRCULATING TRANSFER BETWEEN THE VELOCITY

MODES IN A TRIAD

In Section IV we showed that the mode-to-mode transfer is given by R/ uu = S/ uu + X∆. We interpreted X∆ as a

circulating transfer and S/ uu [Eq. (12)] as an eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer. In this appendix we shall determine the

circulating transfer X∆ for ﬂuid and MHD turbulence, using symmetry considerations. In the ﬁrst section we shall

discuss X∆ in ﬂuid turbulence and in the next section we will discuss the MHD turbulence.

1. X∆ in ﬂuid turbulence

The energy transfer between pair of modes should be invariant under a rotation (because it is a scalar), and galilean

transformation, and it should be ﬁnite for all values of k, p, q, u(k), u(p), u(q). We will determine the form of the

circulating transfer by imposing these and a few other symmetry constraints.

We construct a scalar expression for X∆ dependent on k, p, q, u(k), u(p), u(q), and which is cubic in u and

linear in k, p or q, to satisfy the for dimensional reasons. We write the general expression for such a scalar as

X∆ = Re([k.u(q)]{[u(k).u(p)]α + [u(k).u(q)]β + [u(p).u(q)]γ +

[u(k).u(k)]δ + [u(p).u(p)]ν + [u(q).u(q)]µ} +

[k.u(p)]{[u(k).u(p)]η + [u(k).u(q)]ζ + [u(p).u(q)]ǫ +

[u(k).u(k)]κ + [u(p).u(p)]λ + [u(q).u(q)]θ} +

[p.u(k)]{[u(k).u(p)]ψ + ... + [u(p).u(q)]ω + ... + [u(q).u(q)]χ} +

[p.u(q)]{[u(k).u(p)]τ + ... + [u(p).u(q)]φ + ... + [u(q).u(q)]ϕ} +

[q.u(k)]{[u(k).u(p)]σ + ... + [u(p).u(q)]ξ + ... + [u(q).u(q)]ς} +

[q.u(p)][[u(k).u(p)]π + [u(k).u(q)]ρ + ... + [u(q).u(q)]̺})

(A.1)

where all the coeﬃcients α, β, etc. are atmost non-dimensional functions of the wavenumbers k, p, q and of u(k),

u(p), u(q).

‘Re’ in the expression in Eq. (A.1) indicates the real part of the expression. We should have infact

written X∆ as a linear combination of the real and the imaginary parts of the entire expression in the above equation.

However, we will only consider the real part explicitly. The imaginary part can be treated in the same manner and

the following conclusions, although explicitly stated for the real part will also be valid for the imaginary part. The

23

most general expression should also contain terms of the kind Re[k.u(q)]Re[u(k).u(p)], Re[k.u(q)]Im[u(k).u(p)],

and Im[k.u(q)]Im[u(k).u(p)]. However, we will explain below that such terms should not be present in X∆ on

account of galilean invariance. Hence, from the outset we do not include such terms. The task now is to determine

the coeﬃcients in Eq. (A.1).

The interactions involves all three modes of the triad, i.e., if the Fourier coeﬃcients of any of the wavenumbers is

zero, interaction between the modes is turned oﬀ. The mode-to-mode transfer should respect this fundamental feature

of the triad interactions. Therefore, if u(k), u(p) or u(q) approach zero, X∆ should approach zero as well. We

will argue below that α, β, etc., in Eq. (A.1) are independent of the magnitude of u(k), u(p), u(q). By inspecting

Eq. (A.1) for X∆, hence we ﬁnd that a few terms in the expression are independent of the magnitude of atleast one

of the Fourier components. For example, the term [k.u(q)][u(k).u(q)]β is independent of u(p). Such terms should

be dropped from the expression of circulating transfer. After dropping such terms, we obtain

X∆ = Re([k.u(q)][u(k).u(p)]α + [k.u(p)][[u(k).u(q)]ζ +

[p.u(k)][[u(p).u(q)]ω + [p.u(q)][[u(k).u(p)]τ +

[q.u(k)][[u(p).u(q)]ξ + [q.u(p)][[u(k).u(q)]ρ)

(A.2)

The requirement of ﬁniteness of the mode-to-mode transfer imposes restrictions on the form of X∆. In Eq. (A.1)

the dimensional terms are [k.u(q)][[u(k).u(p)], [k.u(p)][[u(k).u(q)], etc. and they are ﬁnite for all values of k, p, q,

u(k), u(p), u(q). The coeﬃcients α, β, etc. are ‘dimensionless scalars’. Therefore they can be written as

α = f [

k.p
kp

,

k.p
kq

, ...,

k.u(p)
k|u(p)|

,

k.u(p)
k|u(q)|

, ...,

u(k).u(p)
|u(k)||u(p)|

,

u(k).u(p)
|u(k)||u(q)|

, ...]

(A.3)

where the arguments of the function have been non-dimensionalised. Consider triads in which one of the wavenumbers,

say q, tends to zero. Then the terms like k.p/kq with q in the denominator diverge. Similarly if one of the Fourier

coeﬃcients, say u(q), is equal to zero, then the arguments k.u(p)

k|u(q)| and u(k).u(p)

|u(k)||u(q)| , etc. diverge. Hence terms which

depend on the magnitude of vectors must not appear in the expression of the dimensionless scalars α, β, etc. Only the

arguments which depend on the angles between vectors, e.g., k.u(p)

k|u(p)| , u(k).u(p)

|u(k)||u(p)| , should be included. Therefore, all the

dimensionless coeﬃcients should be a function of only these arguments, i.e., α = f [ k.p

kp , ..., k.u(p)

k|u(p)| , ..., u(k).u(p)

We now write the coeﬃcient α, ζ, etc. in the form

α = α(0) + α(1) + α(2) + α(3) + α(4) + α(5)

(A.7)

The quantities α(1), α(2), α(3) are ‘linear’ in the scalars of the type k.p/kp, k.u(p)/k|u(p)|, and u(k).u(p)/|u(k)||u(p)|

respectively. The quantity α(4) contains terms like (k.p)2/k2p2, [k.u(p)]2/k2([u(p).u(p)], etc. which are higher order

in these scalars. All the other coeﬃcients ζ, γ, ω, etc. in Eq. (A.1) can be similarly divided into linear and non-linear

terms.

We now study the consequences of galilean invariance of X∆ on Eq. (A.1). Consider two frames of reference S and

S′ with S moving with respect to S′ with velocity U0. We denote the Fourier coeﬃcient of velocity in frame S and

S′ by u(k) and u′(k) respectively. The relationship between u(k) and u′(k) is given by

u′(k) = u(k) expi(k.U0)t +U0δ(k).

(A.8)

The second term is non-zero only for the k = 0 modes. In the subsequent discussion relating to galilean invariance we

can drop this term for sake of simplicity without aﬀecting the derivation. The transformation rule for scalars of the

type k.p, k.u(p), u(k).u(p) between the two frames of references S and S′ can be deduced from the transformation

property of u(k).

k′.u′(q′) = k.u(q) expi(q.U0)t

u′(k′).u′(p′) = u(k).u(p) expi(k+p).U0t

(A.9)

(A.10)

It follows from the above two transformation rules that k.u(q) and u(k).u(p) are not invariant under a change of

reference frame. However, a product of these quantities can be seen to be invariant

[k′.u′(q′)][u′(k′).u′(p′)] = [k.u(q)][u(k).u(p)] expi(k+p+q).U0t

= [k.u(q)][u(k).u(p)]

(A.11)

using k+p+q=0. However,

25

Re[k′.u′(q′)]Re[u′(k′).u′(p′)] 6= Re[k.u(q)]Re[u(k).u(p)],

Re[k′.u′(q′)]Im[u′(k′).u′(p′)] 6= Re[k.u(q)]Im[u(k).u(p)],

and

Im[k′.u′(q′)]Im[u′(k′).u′(p′)] 6= Im[k.u(q)]Im[u(k).u(p)]

(A.12)

(A.13)

(A.14)

Thus, we have shown that the terms of the kind given in the above three equations are not galilean invariant.

Clearly, the invariance under Galilean transformation demands that all of the vectors u(k), u(p), u(q) appear

either once, twice, or n times in the scalar. A scalar of the type [k.u(q)][u(k).u(q)] having two or more repeated

wavenumber indices is not invariant since the term appearing in the exponential is not zero for such a scalar. The

transformation properties of any quantity formed from the scalars like k.p, k.u(p), u(k).u(p) can be obtained

in a similar manner. If the quantity is not galilean invariant then it should not be included in the expression for

mode-to-mode transfer.

We have shown above that scalars of the type k.u(q) and u(k).u(p) are not Galilean invariant [Eqs. (A.9) and

(A.10)]. It follows that α(2),β(2), etc., α(3), β(3), etc. are not Galilean invariant. To preserve the Galilean invariance

of X∆, the coeﬃcients α(2) and α(3) should be dropped from Eq. (A.4). However, the nonlinear quantity α(4) can be

constructed in a Galilean invariant form. Currently, we have dropped these higher order terms. Our derivation of X∆

therefore has the limitation of being strictly valid only upto the linear order. A complete proof containing all order

of terms in X∆ is beyond the scope of this thesis and is left for future work. After dropping the terms α(2), α(3), α(4),

the Eq. (A.4) reduces to

α = α(0) + α(1)

(A.15)

Using equations (A.4) and (A.15) we now write X in Eq. (A.2) as,

X∆ = Re([k.u(q)][u(k).u(p)]{α0 + α1

We have dropped the superscript ′1′ from α(1)

3 . Using the incompressibility relationship q.u(q) = 0 we

obtain p.u(q) = −(k + q).u(q) = −k.u(q). Therefore, fourth term in the above equation can be absorbed into the

ﬁrst term. Similarly, using the relationships q.u(p) = −k.u(p) and q.u(k) = −p.u(k), the last term can be combined

with the second term and the ﬁfth term combined with the third term. Now, we can write

X∆ = Re([k.u(q)][u(k).u(p)]{α0 + α1

The quantity X∆ represents the energy circulating in the anti-clockwise direction, i.e., X∆ ﬂows along p → k →

q → p [see Fig. 3 in Section IV B]. We will now denote the circulating transfer along p → k by X(k|p|q), transfer

along k → q by X(q|k|p) and so on for the circulating transfer between each pair of modes. The above X∆ is the

circulating transfer from p to k, i.e., X(k|p|q|) ≡ X∆. Then by symmetry the circulating transfer from q to k can

be written as

X(k|q|p) = Re([k.u(p)][u(k).u(q)]{α0 + α1

Each of the three terms in the two equations above has a diﬀerent functional dependence on u(k), u(p), u(q). If

we only rotate u(k) about k without changing its magnitude then each of the terms will change by a diﬀerent factor

depending on the direction of u(p), u(q) which can be independently chosen. Since the sum of three terms should

be zero and each term can change a diﬀerent factor, each of the terms should be individually zero.

In addition,

this should hold for all wavenumber triads. Therefore each term inside the curly bracket should also be individually

zero. This condition gives the the following relationships between the constants: α0 + ζ0 = 0, α1 + ζ2 = 0, α2 + ζ1 =

0, α3 + ζ3 = 0, ω1 − ω2 = 0 from Eq. (A.22), and ω0 + ζ0 = 0, α2 − α3 = 0, ζ1 + ω1 = 0, ζ2 + ω3 = 0, ζ3 + ω2 = 0 from

Eq. (A.23).

We now consider the following geometry - the wavenumber triad form an isosceles triangle with |p| = |q|, and

the Fourier modes u(p) and u(q) are perpendicular to the plane of k, p, q and are equal in magnitude. For this

geometry the clockwise and the anti-clockwise direction are equivalent. There is no preferred direction along which

the circulating transfer may ﬂow. Therefore, for the geometry shown the circulating transfer should be zero. We may

now write the circulating transfer [Eq. (A.17)] for this geometry as

X = Re([p.u(k)][u(p).u(q)]{(ω1 + ω2)

28

= 0

(A.24)

With u(p) and u(q) ﬁxed perpendicular to the plane of the triad, X should be zero for all wavenumber triads which

form an isosceles triangle. For X to be zero for every such geometry, each term inside the curly bracket should be

equated to zero giving the additional relationships: ω1 = −ω2, ω3 = 0, ω0 = 0.

We have obtained 17 relationships between the constants α, ζ, etc. These equations may be solved to get the

values of all these constants. It can be veriﬁed that the only solution of these equations is α’s= 0, ζ’s= 0, ω’s= 0,

a = b = c = 0.

Therefore we get X = 0. It follows that the mode-to-mode transfer R/ uu = S/ uu.

We have thus determined the mode-to-mode transfer. The proof used rotational invariance, galilean invariance,

ﬁniteness of mode-to-mode transfer, and symmetry of X with respect to k, p, q, u(k), u(p), u(q). However, in the

series we have taken only linear terms in k.p, k.u(p), u(k).u(p). A complete proof containing all orders of terms is

beyond the scope of this thesis. It may be possible to obtain a completely general proof by ﬁnding some symmetries

which we have ignored in our proof. Otherwise a novel approach may be required.

2. X∆ in MHD turbulence

The circulating transfer between the velocity modes in MHD can also be shown to be equal to zero to linear

order terms in k.p, k.u(p), u(k).u(p) . The arguments leading to this are nearly the same as that for the ﬂuid case.

However, we additionally need to show that the general expression for the circulating transfer X∆ for MHD should

not contain b(k), b(p), b(q) and can also be given by Eq. (A.1)

In the previous section we showed that each term in X∆ should depend on u(k), u(p), u(q) — this followed from

the fundamentally three-mode feature of the interactions. The expression for the combined energy transfer to u(k)

from u(p) and u(q) is identical for the ﬂuid and for the MHD case. Hence, in the case of MHD also, each term in

the circulating transfer between the velocity modes should be dependent on u(k), u(p), and u(q). Thus, the general

expression for the circulating transfer between the velocity modes in MHD is the same as that for Fluid turbulence.

The rest of the arguments leading to X∆ = 0 in MHD are identical to those in Section A 1.

APPENDIX B: DERIVATION OF CIRCULATING TRANSFER BETWEEN THE MAGNETIC MODES

IN A TRIAD

In Section VII B we had shown that the mode-to-mode transfer from b(p) to b(k) can be written as R/ bb = S/ bb +Y∆,

where S/ bb given by Eq. (49) is the eﬀective transfer between the modes and Y∆ is the circulating transfer. In this

section we will derive the expression for the circulating transfer Y∆. The derivation for Y∆ is similar to the derivation

of X∆ for ﬂuid turbulence given in Appendix A.

Since the mode-to-mode transfer is a scalar, the circulating transfer Y∆ will also be a scalar with a dependence on

the wavenumbers k, p, q and the Fourier coeﬃcients u(k), u(p), u(q), b(k), b(p), b(q). It should be linear in k,

p or q and cubic in the Fourier coeﬃcients u(k), u(p), u(q), b(k), b(p), b(q) for dimensional reasons.

The most general form of Y∆ that satisﬁes these properties can be written as

Y∆ = Y (1)

∆ + Y (2)

(B.4)

(B.5)

Following Appendix A we consider explicitly only the real part, which is denoted by Re in the above equations.

If we take a linear combination of the real and the imaginary parts instead, the derivation and the conclusions

regarding Y∆ will not change. In addition, terms of the Re[k.u(q)]Re[u(k).u(p)], Re[k.u(q)]Re[u(k).b(p)], etc. are

not included as they violate galilean invariance - we had explained this in Appendix A in context of X∆. The three

dots ‘...’

in the above equations in front of some of the terms indicate that a coeﬃcient multiplies each of these

terms but which we have not shown explicitly as they do not enter most of the future discussion. The coeﬃcients

α, β, etc.

in the above expressions for Y (1)

∆ ,.. Y (4)

∆ are non-dimensional functions of the wavenumbers k, p, q and

of u(k), u(p), u(q), b(k, b(p), b(q). To determine Y∆ we should now determine these coeﬃcients. Note that

besides the terms of the kind [k.u(q)]{...}, [k.u(p)]{...}, [p.u(k)]{...} in Eqs. (B.2)-( B.5), there are also terms of the

kind [p.u(q)]{...}, [q.u(p)]{...}, [q.u(k)]{...}. However, using the incompressibility constraints k.u(k) = 0 and the

constraint k + p + q = 0, we have absorbed the latter three terms into the former ones. Now we will impose a few

restrictions on the form of Y∆.

The interactions between the magnetic modes fundamentally involve three-modes — the combined energy

transfer to a magnetic mode, say b(k), depends on the Fourier coeﬃcients at all three wavenumbers (k,

p, q). For example, the combined energy transfer to b(k) from b(p) and b(q), given by Sbb(k|p, q) =

31

−Re (i[k.u(q)][b(k).b(p)] + i[k.u(p)][b(k).b(q)]), depends on u(p), u(q), b(p), b(q), and b(k). The mode-to-

mode transfer should not break the fundamentally three-mode feature of these interactions, i.e., the mode-to-mode

transfer should have Fourier coeﬃcients from all wavenumbers k, p, q. Hence we will drop all those terms from Y (1)
∆

to Y (4)

∆ which are independent of atleast one of the wavenumbers k, p, q. Then, we get

Y (1)
∆ = Re( [k.u(q)] {[u(k).b(p)]... + [u(p).b(k)]...} +[k.u(p)] {[u(k).b(q)]... + [u(q).b(k)]...} +

[p.u(k)] {[u(p).b(q)]... + [u(q).b(p)]...})

Y (2)
∆ = Re([k.u(q)][b(k).b(p)]α + [k.u(p)][b(k).b(q)]β + [p.u(k)][b(p).b(q)]γ)

Y (3)
∆ = Re([k.b(q)]{[u(k).b(p)]δ + [u(p).b(k)]η} +

[k.b(p)]{[u(k).b(q)]µ + [u(q).b(k)]ν} +

[p.b(k)]{[u(p).b(q)]ψ + [u(q).b(p)]χ})

Y (4)
∆ = Re([k.b(q)][u(k).u(p)]θ + [k.b(p)][u(k).u(q)]φ + [p.b(k)][u(k).u(k)]...)

(B.6)

(B.7)

(B.8)

(B.9)

We put the following additional restriction on the form of Y∆. If none of the magnetic modes in the triad are

gaining/losing energy to the other two modes, i.e., if the combined energy transfer to each one of them is equal to

zero, then even the circulating transfer should be equal to zero. We observe the following additional feature of the

interactions. The combined energy transfer to every magnetic mode in the triad from the other two magnetic modes

is equal to zero, if any two of b(k), b(p), b(q) are zero (see Eq. (36). The mode-to-mode transfer should also respect

this feature of the interactions, i.e., the circulating transfer should be zero if {b(k), b(p)=0}, or {b(k), b(q)=0},

or {b(p), b(q)=0}. Now, let us put b(k)=0, b(p)=0 in Y (1)

∆ to Y (4)

∆ . It can easily shown that Y∆ will be zero, for

arbitrary values u’s and b’s, only if the all coeﬃcients in Y (1)

∆ and Y (4)

∆ are themselves equal to zero. Hence we drop

Y (1)
∆ and Y (4)

∆ from Y∆ [Eq. (B.1)]. We get,

Y∆ = Y (2)

∆ + Y (3)

∆

(B.10)

and

32

Y (2)
∆ = Re([k.u(q)][b(k).b(p)]α + [k.u(p)][b(k).b(q)]β +

[p.u(k)][b(p).b(q)]γ )

(B.11)

Y (3)
∆ = Re([k.b(q)]{[u(k).b(p)]δ + [u(p).b(k)]η} +

[k.b(p)]{[u(k).b(q)]µ + [u(q).b(k)]ν} +

[p.b(k)]{[u(p).b(q)]ψ + [u(q).b(p)]χ})

(B.12)

In Appendix A we had considered the derivation of circulating transfer X∆ between the velocity modes. By imposing

the condition of ﬁniteness of the circulating transfer we had concluded that the coeﬃcients should be independent

of the magnitude of the wavenumbers and the Fourier coeﬃcients u(k), etc. On imposing the constraint that Y∆

should be ﬁnite and following the reasoning in Appendix A, we can conclude that the coeﬃcients α, β, etc. should

be independent of the magnitude of the wavenumbers and of the Fourier coeﬃcients of the velocity and the magnetic

ﬁelds. Therefore, we may write the coeﬃcient α = f [ k.p

kp , ..., k.u(p)

k|u(p)| , k.b(p)

k|b(p)| , ..., u(k).u(p)

|u(k)||u(p)| , b(k).b(p)

|b(k)||b(p)| , ..., u(k).b(p)

|u(k)||b(p)| , ...].

The other coeﬃcients can also be written in the same manner.

We will now write the coeﬃcients α, β, etc. as

where α(1)

1 , α(1)

2 , α(2)

1 , etc.

are all unknown constants.

The quantities α(1), α(2), α(3) are ‘linear’

in the

scalars of the type k.p/kp, k.u(p)/k|u(p)|, k.b(p)/k|b(p)|, u(k).u(p)/|u(k)||u(p)|, b(k).b(p)/|b(k)||b(p)|, and

33

u(k).b(p)/|u(k)||b(p)|.

The quantity α(4) contains higher order terms in these scalars like (k.p)2/k2p2,

[k.u(p)]2/k2([u(p).u(p)], etc. All the other coeﬃcients ζ, γ, ω, etc.

in Eqs. (B.11)-(B.12) can be similarly divided

into linear and non-linear terms.

The mode-to-mode transfer should be invariant under a galilean transformation. In Appendix A, we had given

the transformation rules for the scalars of the type k.p, k.u(p), u(k).u(p) and for a combination of these like

[k.u(p)][u(k).u(q)]. For the present case we also need to consider the transformation properties of the magnetic

ﬁeld. MHD equations hold for low velocities and only quantities upto the order of v/c are included in the equations.

Under this approximation the magnetic ﬁelds are equal in the two frames S and S′ with a relative velocity U0. Then,

the Fourier coeﬃcient b(k) in the frame S and b′(k) in the frame S′ are related as

b′(k) = b(k) expi(k.U0)t

(B.17)

This diﬀers from the galilean transformation of u(k) by the term U0δ(k) only. Using the above relationship between

between b(k) and b′(k) the transformation rules for k.b(q), b(k).b(p), u(k).b(p) are

k′.b′(q′) = k.b(q) expi(q.U0)t,

b′(k′).b′(p′) = b(k).b(p) expi(k+p).U0t,

u′(k′).b′(p′) = u(k).b(p) expi(k+p).U0t .

(B.18)

(B.19)

(B.20)

These scalars are not galilean invariant (in Appendix A, we had likewise shown that the scalars of the type k.u(p),

u(k).u(p) are not galilean invariant). It follows that α(2), β(2), etc., α(3), β(3), etc. are not invariant under a galilean

transformation. To preserve the galilean invariance of Y∆, the coeﬃcients α(2), α(3), β(2), β(3), and other such

coeﬃcients should be dropped from Eq. (B.13). The nonlinear quantity α(4), β(4), etc. can be constructed in a

galilean invariant form. Even then we will drop this term. We had also dropped this term from the expression for

X∆ in Appendix A. Our derivation for Y∆, like the derivation of X∆ in Appendix A, is is thus valid only upto the

linear orders. After dropping the coeﬃcients α(2), α(3), α(4) and other coeﬃcients of this type, Eq. (B.13) reduces to

α = α(0) + α(1)

Using Eqs. (B.21) and (B.14) we can now write Y (2)

∆ and Y (3)

p → k → q → p [see Fig. 8 in Section VII B]. We will now denote the circulating transfer along p → k by Y∆(k|p|q),

transfer along k → q by Y∆(q|k|p) and so on for the circulating transfer between each pair of modes. We take

Y∆(k|p|q) ﬂows along the anti-clockwise direction while Y∆(k|q|p) and Y∆(p|k|q) ﬂow along the clockwise direction.

Since each term in the above equation has a diﬀerent functional dependence on u(k), u(p), u(q), b(k), b(p), b(q),

each term should be individually zero. It follows that the constants in the above equations should satisfy the following

relationships : from Eq. (B.30) we get α(0) + β(0) = 0, α1 + β2 = 0, α2 + β1 = 0, α3 + β3 = 0, γ1 − γ2 = 0δ(0) + µ(0) =

0, δ1 + µ2 = 0, δ2 + µ1 = 0, δ3 + µ3 = 0, η(0) + ν(0) = 0, η1 + ν2 = 0, η2 + ν1 = 0, η3 + ν3 = 0, φ(0) − χ(0) = 0, φ1 − χ2 =

0, φ2 − χ1 = 0, φ3 − χ3 = 0, and from Eq. (B.31) we get α2 − α3 = 0, β(0) + γ(0) = 0, β1 + γ1 = 0, β2 + γ3 = 0, β3 + γ2 =

0, δ(0) − η(0) = 0, δ1 − η1 = 0, δ2 − η3 = 0, δ3 − η2 = 0, µ(0) + φ(0) = 0, µ1 + φ1 = 0, µ2 + φ3 = 0, µ3 + φ2 = 0, ν(0) + χ(0) =

0, ν2 + χ3 = 0, µ3 + φ2 = 0.

The above relationships can be arranged into the following groups: {α(0) = −β(0) = γ(0)}, {δ(0) = −µ(0) = φ(0) =

η(0) = −ν(0) = χ(0)}, {α1 = −β2 = γ3}, {α2 = −β1 = γ1 = γ2 = α3 = −β3}, {δ1 = −µ2 = φ3 = χ3 = −ν2 = η1},

{δ2 = −µ1 = φ1 = χ2 = −ν3 = η3}, {δ3 = −µ3 = φ2 = χ1 = −ν1 = η2}.

Let us now consider a triad with |p| = |q|, k.p = k.q and with the Fourier modes u(p), u(q), b(p), b(q) perpen-

37

dicular to the plane formed by this triad. We argued in Appendix A that the circulating transfer should vanish for

such a geometry. For this geometry we can write Y∆ from Eq. (B.22) and ( B.23) as

Y∆ = Re( [p.u(k)][b(p).b(q)]{γ(0) + (γ1 + γ2) k.p

kp + γ3

p.q

[p.b(k)][u(p).b(q)]{φ(0) + (φ1 + φ2) k.p

p.q
pq } +

[p.b(k)][u(q).b(p)]{χ(0) + (χ1 + χ2) k.p

kp + χ3

p.q
pq } )

= 0

(B.32)

The above equality should hold for all triads with |p| = |q| and k.p=k.q. Therefore each term inside the curly brackets

should be individually zero. This leads us to the following additional relationships between the various constants in

the above equation: γ(0) = 0, γ1 + γ2 = 0, γ3 = 0, φ(0) = 0, φ2 + φ3 = 0, φ1 = 0, χ(0) = 0, χ1 + χ3 = 0, χ2 = 0,

Similarly, by choosing |k| = |p|, and u(k), u(p), b(k), b(p) perpendicular to the triad plane we get the relationships

α(0) = 0, α1 = 0, α2 + α3 = 0, δ(0) = 0, δ1 = 0, δ2 + δ3 = 0, η(0) = 0, η1 = 0, η2 + η3 = 0. and by choosing |k| = |q|, and

u(k), u(q), b(k), b(q) perpendicular to the triad plane we get β(0) = 0, β2 = 0, β1 + β3 = 0, µ(0) = 0, µ2 = 0, µ1 + µ3 =

0, ν(0) = 0, ν2 = 0, ν1 + ν3 = 0.

Using these relationships the above groups take the following values: { α(0) = −β(0) = γ(0) = 0}, {δ(0) =

−µ(0) = φ(0) = η(0) = −ν(0) = χ(0) = 0}, {α1 = −β2 = γ3 = 0}, {α2 = −β1 = γ1 = γ2 = α3 = −β3 = 0},

{δ1 = −µ2 = φ3 = χ3 = −ν2 = η1 = 0}, {δ2 = −µ1 = φ1 = χ2 = −ν3 = η3 = −δ3 = µ3 = −φ2 = −χ1 = ν1 = −η2}.

Hence, some of the constants are equal to zero, and all the non-zero constants are related to each other by just one

undetermined constant which we will denote by ′C′, i.e., {δ2 = −µ1 = ... = C}

Putting the values of these constants in the expressions for Y (2)

∆ and Y (3)

∆ in Eqs. (B.22)-(B.23) we get

Y (2)
∆ = 0

For the determination of X∆ in Appendix A, the above considerations were suﬃcient to determine X∆. However,

in the present case we are still left with one undetermined constant. We will now impose the constraint of locality

which we state as follows: In the limit k, q → ∞ >> p, Y∆ should tend to zero. If Z∆ remains ﬁnite then the noise,

which is always inevitably present in any ﬂow at the smallest scales, would interact directly with the large scales.

Moreover, the locality constraint is also necessary in order that the circulating transfer is consistent with the eﬀective

transfer between b(k) and b(q) which goes to zero for in the above limit. Let us take u(k), u(q) to be perpendicular

to the plane of the triad. Then we can write Y∆ as

Y (3)
∆ = Re([k.b(p)][u(k).b(q)]{−C k.p

kp + C p.q

pq } + [k.b(p)][u(q).b(k)]{C k.p

kp − C p.q

pq })

which may be written in terms of the angles of the triangle formed by k, p, q [Fig. B.1] as

∆ = Re(hˆk.b(p)i[u(k).b(q)]{−Ck cos(ψ) − Ck cos(θ)} +
Y (3)
hˆk.b(p)i[u(q).b(k)]{Ck cos(ψ) + Ck cos(θ)}

)

(B.35)

(B.36)

We now take the limit k, q → ∞, keeping ψ and p constant. In this limit φ → 0. Making use of the relationships

θ = π − ψ − φ, k/ sin θ = p/ sin φ, and taking the limit φ → 0, we get for Y∆ → hˆk.b(p)i[u(k).b(q)]{−Cp sin2(ψ)} +
hˆk.b(p)i[u(q).b(k)]{Cp sin2(ψ)}. However, in this limit Y∆ should tend to zero in order to satisfy locality. From this
constraint we get C = 0. Putting the value of C in Eq. (B.34) gives Y (3)

∆ = 0.

Therefore we get Y∆ = 0. It follows that the mode-to-mode transfer R/ bb = S/ bb.

In the above proof we used rotational invariance, galilean invariance, ﬁniteness of mode-to-mode transfer, the

symmetry of Y∆ with respect to k, p, q, u(k), u(p), u(q), b(k), b(p), b(q), and the assumption that the

circulating transfer should vanish if two of the wavenumbers approach inﬁnity. This proof is valid only upto linear

orders, as explained earlier in this appendix. A completely general proof without taking recourse to the linearity

assumption is lacking at present.

APPENDIX C: DERIVATION OF THE CIRCULATING TRANSFER BETWEEN VELOCITY MODES

AND MAGNETIC MODES IN A TRIAD

In Section VII C we had shown that the energy transfer from u(p) to b(k) in the triad (k, p, q) can be expressed

as R/ bu(k|p|q) = S/ bu(k|p|q) + Z∆. S/ bu(k|p|q) is given by Eq. (76) of Section VII C was interpreted as the eﬀective

transfer from u(p) to b(k) and Z∆ was interpreted as a circulating transfer between the velocity and magnetic

modes belonging to a triad. We will follow the approach of Appendix A and Appendix B to determine Z∆ in this

Appendix. We will impose the following conditions on Z∆. It should not violate the fundamentally triad nature of

the interactions, it should be ﬁnite, rotationally invariant, galilean invariant, and should vanish if k/p → ∞.

The circulating transfer Z∆ is a scalar with a dependence on atmost k, p, q, u(k), u(p), u(q), b(k), b(p), b(q).

We know from Appendix B that such a function can be expressed in the form given by Eqs. (B.1)-(B.5) of Appendix

B. The interactions between the velocity and the magnetic modes are fundamentally three-mode, i.e., each term in

the expression for combined energy transfer to a velocity or a magnetic mode depends on all the three wavenumbers

(k, p, q). the combined energy transfer to any of the velocity or the magnetic modes in the triad. Z∆ should not

violate this fundamental nature of the interactions. Hence we should drop all those terms from Eqs. (B.1)-(B.5) which

are independent of atleast one of the modes and then we get Eqs. (B.6)-(B.9) for Z∆. The combined energy transfer

to velocity and magnetic modes in the triad are zero if {b(k), b(p) = 0}, {b(k), b(q) = 0}, or {b(p), b(q) =

0}. The terms which are non-vanishing if one of the above set of Fourier coeﬃcients are zero will be dropped from

Eqs. (B.6)-(B.9), giving Eqs. (B.10)-(B.12) In Appendix B also we had imposed identical constraints on Eqs. (B.1)-

(B.5) to get Eqs. (B.10)-(B.12). The dimensionless coeﬃcients in these equations are k, p, q, u(k), u(p), u(q),

b(k), b(p), b(q) dependent and we will now attempt to determine these.

In Appendix B we had considered the consequences of ﬁniteness and galilean invariance on Eqs. (B.10)-(B.12)

of Appendix B. We will brieﬂy summarise the conclusions now. To ensure the ﬁniteness and galilean invariance

of Eqs. (B.10)-(B.12) the dimensionless coeﬃcients in these equations should be independent of the magnitudes

of the wavenumbers and the Fourier coeﬃcients. Then each coeﬃcient in the equations can be written as α =

α(0) + α(1) + α(2) + α(3) + α(4) where α(0) is a constant, α(1), α(2), α(3) deﬁned in Eqs. (B.14)-(B.16) of Appendix

B. are linear in terms of the kind k.p, k.u(p), u(k).u(p) respectively, and α(4) is nonlinear in these terms. α(2),

and α(3) are not galilean invariant and would therefore lead to the non-invariance of Eqs. (B.14)-(B.16) of Appendix

B. Hence, α(2) and α(3) should not be included in α. In Appendix B we had also dropped α(4). Therefore, we get

40

α = α(0) + α(1). Following Appendix B we will now write Z∆ [given by Eqs. (B.10)-(B.12) in Appendix B]

The quantities Z bu

3∆ represent the energy circulating from u(p) → b(k) → u(q) → b(p)... → u(p) [see

Fig. 9 in Section VII C]. We will denote the circulating transfer from u(p) → b(k) by Z bu

∆ (k|p|q), from b(p) → u(k)

by Z ub

∆ (k|p|q) and so on for the circulating transfer between other modes. We take Z bu

( C.3) to be the circulating transfer from u(p) → b(k), i.e., Z bu

∆ (k|p|q) ≡ Z∆. Then by symmetry the circulating

We have dropped the superscript ‘1’ in the above equations. Z bu

∆ (k|p|q) and Z ub

∆ (p|k|q) are physically the same

transfers, but the former represents the transfer from u(p) to b(k) and the latter represents the same transfer from

b(k) to u(p) The former should therefore be equal and opposite in sign to the latter, i.e.,

Z bu

∆ (k|p|q) + Z ub

∆ (p|k|q) = 0

(C.7)

Z ub

∆ (p|k|q) is thus given by the negative of Eqs. (C.1)-(C.3). Using the expression for Z ub

The sum of the circulating transfer to b(k) from u(p) and from u(q) should be zero, i.e.,

Z bu

∆ (k|q|p) = 0

(C.11)

(C.12)

(C.13)

(C.14)

and similarly the sum of the circulating transfer to u(k) from b(p) and from b(q) should also be equal to zero, i.e.,

Z ub

∆ (k|p|q) + Z ub

∆ (k|q|p) = 0

(C.15)

Replacing Z bu

∆ (k|p|q) and Z bu

∆ (k|q|p) from Eqs. (C.1)-(C.3) and Eqs. (C.4)-(C.6) into Eq. (C.14) we get the

following relationships between the constants: α, β, etc. α(0) + β(0) = 0, α1 + β2 = 0, α2 + β1 = 0, α3 + β3 =

0, γ1 − γ2 = 0, δ(0) + µ(0) = 0, δ1 + µ2 = 0, δ2 + µ1 = 0, δ3 + µ3 = 0, η(0) + ν(0) = 0, η1 + ν2 = 0, η2 + ν1 = 0, η3 + ν3 =

0, φ(0) − χ(0) = 0, φ1 − χ2 = 0, φ2 − χ1 = 0, φ3 − χ3 = 0. After replacing Z ub

∆ (k|p|q) and Z ub

∆ (k|q|p) from Eqs. (C.1)-

(C.3) and Eqs. (C.11)-(C.13) into Eq. (C.15) we get the following relationships: α2 − α3 = 0, β(0) + γ(0) = 0, β1 + γ1 =

0, β2 + γ3 = 0, β3 + γ2 = 0, δ(0) − η(0) = 0, δ1 − η1 = 0, δ2 − η3 = 0, δ3 − η2 = 0, µ(0) + φ(0) = 0, µ1 + φ1 = 0, µ2 + φ3 =

0, µ3 + φ2 = 0, ν(0) + χ(0) = 0, ν2 + χ3 = 0, µ3 + φ2 = 0.

Let us now consider the following geometry: the three wavenumbers in the triad form an isosceles triangle, and we

choose Fourier coeﬃcients at the two wavenumbers of equal lengths to be perpendicular to k, p, q. We had considered

this kind of geometry in Appendix A and Appendix B. We had argued that because of the symmetry between the

two wavenumbers of equal length, the circulating transfer should vanish for this geometry. This constraint had given

us an additional set of relationships between the constants in Y∆. Z bu

∆ should also be equal to zero for this geometry.

Since Z bu

∆ and Y∆ have the same functional form, given by Eq. (B.22)-(B.23) of Appendix B and Eq. (C.1)-(C.3) of

this appendix respectively, hence imposition of this constraint on Z bu

∆ would give the same set of relationships, i.e.,

γ(0) = 0, γ1 + γ2 = 0, γ3 = 0, φ(0) = 0, φ2 + φ3 = 0, φ1 = 0, χ(0) = 0, χ1 + χ3 = 0, χ2 = 0, α(0) = 0, α1 = 0, α2 + α3 =

0, δ(0) = 0, δ1 = 0, δ2 + δ3 = 0, η(0) = 0, η1 = 0, η2 + η3 = 0, β(0) = 0, β2 = 0, β1 + β3 = 0, µ(0) = 0, µ2 = 0, µ1 + µ3 =

0, ν(0) = 0, ν2 = 0, ν1 + ν3 = 0.

The above relationships between the constants in Eqs. (C.2)-(C.3) are identical to the relationships between the

constants in Eqs. (B.22)-(B.23) of Appendix B. We know from Appendix B that these relationships can be expressed

more clearly as follows: { α(0) = −β(0) = γ(0) = 0}, {δ(0) = −µ(0) = φ(0) = η(0) = −ν(0) = χ(0) = 0}, {α1 = −β2 =

γ3 = 0}, {α2 = −β1 = γ1 = γ2 = α3 = −β3 = 0}, {δ1 = −µ2 = φ3 = χ3 = −ν2 = η1 = 0}, {δ2 = −µ1 = φ1 = χ2 =

−ν3 = η3 = −δ3 = µ3 = −φ2 = −χ1 = ν1 = −η2}. There is just one undetermined constant which we will denote by

‘C’, i.e., {δ2 = −µ1 = ... = C}. Expressing Z bu

∆ [Eqs. (C.2)-(C.3)] in terms of this single constant, we get

Z2∆ = 0

Z3∆ = Re( [k.b(q)][u(k).b(p)]{C k.q

kq } )

which is the same as the expression for for Y∆ in Eqs. (B.33)-(B.34) of Appendix B.

If k/p and q/p → ∞, while p is kept constant the circulating transfer Z∆ should tend to zero. This constraint was

also applied on the circulating transfer between magnetic modes, Y∆ in Appendix B. We had shown that the constant

(C.17)

C = 0 for this constraint to be satisﬁed. Putting C = 0 in Eqs. (C.16)-(C.17) we get Z bu

∆ = Z bu

2∆ + Z bu

3∆ equal to zero.

The circulating transfer between the velocity and the magnetic modes in the triad is equal to zero and the mode-

to-mode transfer R/ bu(k|p|q) = S/ bu(k|p|q).

44

The derivation of Z bu

∆ , however took the coeﬃcients to be linear. A completely general derivation for Z bu

∆ will

require imposition of additional symmetry and invariance or some other constraints, which we have ignored here.

APPENDIX D: EQUIVALENCE OF KRAICHNAN’S FORMULA AND OUR FORMULA FOR THE

KINETIC ENERGY FLUX

In this appendix we will show that the ﬂux formula (30) based on the eﬀective mode-to-mode transfer is equivalent

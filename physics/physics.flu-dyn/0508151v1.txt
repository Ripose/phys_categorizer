Multiscale mixing eﬃciencies for passive scalar advection are deﬁned in terms of the suppression of
variance weighted at various length scales. We consider scalars maintained by temporally steady but
spatially inhomogeneous sources, stirred by statistically homogeneous and isotropic incompressible
ﬂows (including fully developed turbulence). The mixing eﬃciencies are rigorously bounded in terms
of the P´eclet number and quantitative features of the source. Scaling exponents for the high P´eclet
number bounds on these multi-scale mixing eﬃciencies depend on the spectrum of length scales in
the source.

Introduction. Eﬀective mixing is a key feature of both
laminar and turbulent ﬂuid ﬂows that plays a central role
in many scientiﬁc and engineering applications. Much
recent research has been concerned with various aspects
of this including chaotic mixing, eﬀective transport co-
eﬃcients, i.e., eddy diﬀusions, and statistical features of
scalar mixing by random velocity ﬁelds [1, 2]. In this Let-
ter we derive some fundamental limits on the eﬀective-
ness of mixing by statistically stationary homogeneous
isotropic ﬂows, including turbulence. We do this by rig-
orously bounding the suppression of variance for passive
scalars continuously maintained by spatially inhomoge-
neous sources and stirred by statistically steady state
divergence-free velocity ﬁelds. A decrease in the variance
indicates a more uniformly mixed scalar. By comparing
variances in the presence of stirring with that resulting
from molecular diﬀusion alone we identify natural dimen-
sionless measures of the mixing eﬃciency.

The scalar variance may be weighted at diverse spatial
length scales so we introduce a family of mixing eﬃcien-
cies that indicate the eﬀectiveness of the stirring on dif-
ferent scales. These mixing eﬃciencies generally depend
on details of both the source and the stirring, but we
are able to derive mathematically rigorous and physically
relevant bounds on them in terms of the P´eclet number
and a few quantitative features of the source alone. The
high P´eclet number scaling exponents for the bounds de-
pend on the spatial dimension, the length scales upon
which the variance is observed, and the spectrum of spa-
tial scales in the source. This analysis provides important
new insights into scaling theories for chaotic advection
and concepts of turbulent eddy diﬀusivity.

Problem statement and deﬁnitions. The advection–
diﬀusion equation for the concentration θ(x, t) of a pas-

sive scalar is

∂tθ + u

· ∇

θ = κ ∆θ + s ,

(1)

where κ is the molecular diﬀusivity. For simplicity here
we restrict attention to spatially periodic boundary con-
ditions for x
[0, L]d. The time-independent source s(x)
in (1) is taken (without loss of generality) to have spa-
tial mean zero so eventually the concentration θ(x, t) will
have spatial mean zero as well.

∈

The velocity ﬁeld u(x, t) is given;

it could be the
solution of some dynamical equations or a particular
stochastic process, but in any case we consider it to be
a prescribed divergence-free vector ﬁeld with the follow-
ing (weak) equal-time single-point statistical properties
shared by homogeneous isotropic turbulence:

where overbar represents the long-time average (assumed
to exist) at each point in space. The velocity scale
U indicates the strength of the stirring and Γ provides
an indication of the ﬂow ﬁeld’s shear content. The ra-
tio λ = U/Γ corresponds to the usual Taylor microscale
for homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We deﬁne the
P´eclet number for the ﬂow according to Pe = U L/κ.

We quantify the mixing of the scalar by examining the

Each eﬃciency is asymptotically proportional to Pe, cor-
responding to the expected suppression of variance if the
molecular diﬀusivity κ is replaced by an eddy diﬀusivity
proportional to U L. Moreover these upper bounds are
sharp; they may be realized by uniform ﬂow ﬁelds whose
direction varies appropriately in time to satisfy the weak
statistical homogeneity and isotropy conditions used in
the analysis (to be reported elsewhere) [6]. Each estimate
also exhibits a decreasing dependence on the length scale
of the source; at high Pe the estimates for the small and
intermediate scale eﬃciencies M−1 and M0 are
Pe/ks.
∼
This suggests that the P´eclet number might better be de-
ﬁned as a product of U/κ and a length scale k−1
charac-
terizing the source, rather than some scale characterizing
the stirring. For large ks diﬀusion dominates and all the
bounds approach the purely-diﬀusive value of the mix-
ing eﬃciency (unity). This eﬀect has also been veriﬁed
in direct numerical simulations of such monochromatic
sources stirred by particular ﬂows [6].

Smooth Sources. We refer to L2 sources where the
Fourier coeﬃcients are square-summable as “smooth”.
The asymptotic Pe

These are the same Pe scalings as observed for
monochromatic sources but with prefactors involving dis-
tinct characteristic length scales of the source tailored to
the scales to which the diﬀerent eﬃciencies are tuned.
1
We reiterate that the Pe
scaling of the eﬃciencies is
precisely that which is expected from the conventional
notion of eddy diﬀusion, at least with regard to the U
and κ dependence. A novel feature of these rigorous es-
timates is that the “mixing lengths” to be employed in
constructing the eﬀective diﬀusion from U depend on (i)
the source structure rather than some characteristic per-
sistence length in the ﬂow, and (ii) the concentrations
ﬂuctuation scales stressed by the diﬀerent multiscale ef-
ﬁciencies.

The roughest physically meaningful sources are measure–

d = 2 or 3, so those scalings are invalid. In this case the

Rough sources with a cutoﬀ. Approximate delta-like
sources of small but ﬁnite size ℓ have Fourier coeﬃ-
cients sk that are approximately constant in magnitude
up to a cutoﬀ wavenumber of order 2π/ℓ, beyond which
the spectrum decays like a smooth source. We may de-
duce the behavior of the bound on M0 for such sources
by inserting an upper limit at L/ℓ
1 into the inte-
gral (11). For large but intermediate P´eclet numbers
satisfying 1
L/ℓ, the cutoﬀ is ineﬀective so the
logarithmic correction (13) in d = 2 and the anomalous
scaling (15) in d = 3 appear. However for Pe
L/ℓ, i.e.,
if the modiﬁed P´eclet number based on the smallest scale
1, then the smooth source results
in the source U ℓ/κ
apply and we recover the mixing eﬃciency bounds linear
in Pe, as in (10). Figure (1) shows this scaling transition
for the d = 3 case. Even in the highest P´eclet number
regime where the source appears smooth, the prefactor
in front of the ultimate large Pe scaling bounds are sig-
niﬁcantly diminished by the small scales in the source:

while M0 is anomalous only for γ = 0. In d = 3, M1 is
again anomalous for any degree of roughness while M0
scales anomolously for 0
γ < 1/2. For both d = 2 and
3 the bound on the large scale mixing eﬃciency M−1 is
always conventional. Of course these scalings neglect any
large-k cutoﬀ for the rough sources. If there is a cutoﬀ
then the same arguments apply to recover the normal
scaling proportional to Pe for Pe
L/ℓ, where 2π/ℓ is
the cutoﬀ wavenumber.

Discussion. The multiscale mixing eﬃciency bounds
derived here reveal new aspects of the ability—and in
some cases the inability—of statistically homogeneous
and isotropic ﬂows to eﬀectively suppress ﬂuctuations
in passive scalars. Several notable features of the phe-
nomena have emerged from this analysis. One is that
the structure of the source maintaining the scalar con-
centration plays a central role in eﬃciency of mixing at
diﬀerent length scales while the detailed structure of the
ﬂow, i.e., the spectrum of length (and time) scales in
the velocity ﬁeld, plays only a secondary role as far as
the small and intermediate scale eﬃciencies M1 and M0
are concerned. For rough sources these eﬃciencies scale
at least as anomalously as indicated in Table I and no
clever small scale stirring can alleviate this eﬀect. The
bound on M−1 in (10c), however, allows for the possibil-
ity that small scale structure and shear in the advecting
ﬂow could enhance the large scale mixing eﬃciency.

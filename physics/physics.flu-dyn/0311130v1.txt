We consider the induction of magnetic ﬁeld in ﬂows of electrically conducting ﬂuid at low magnetic
Prandtl number and large kinetic Reynolds number. Using the separation between the magnetic
and kinetic diﬀusive lengthscales, we propose a new numerical approach. The coupled magnetic
and ﬂuid equations are solved using a mixed scheme, where the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are fully
resolved and the velocity ﬂuctuations at small scale are modelled using a Large Eddy Simulation
(LES) scheme. We study the response of a forced Taylor-Green ﬂow to an externally applied ﬁeld:
tology of the mean induction and time ﬂuctuations at ﬁxed locations. The results are in remarkable
agreement with existing experimental data; a global 1/f behavior at long times is also evidenced.

One of the strongest motivation in the study of non-
linear eﬀects in magnetohydrodynamics is that electri-
cally conductive ﬂows are capable of dynamo action: the
stretching of magnetic ﬁeld lines by the ﬂow velocity gra-
dients can exceed the (Joule) diﬀusion. A bifurcation
threshold occurs, above which the self-generation of a
magnetic ﬁeld takes place. It has been validated in con-
strained ﬂows of liquid sodium which mimic analytical
models: the Karlsruhe [1] and Riga experiments [2]. The
self-generation of a magnetic ﬁeld in non-constrained ho-
mogeneous ﬂows is still an open problem actively studied
by many groups [3].
In this research, numerical stud-
ies have long played an important role. Kinematic dy-
namo simulations assume a given pattern of a station-
ary velocity ﬁeld and study the initial linear growth rate
of magnetic ﬁeld perturbations. They have been exten-
sively used to test the dynamo capacity of ﬂow geometries
and proved to be successful at determining the dynamo
threshold in the Karlsruhe and Riga experiments [4, 5].
They have also shown that dynamo action is a possibility
in unconstrained homogeneous ﬂows of the von K´arm´an
type [6, 7]. Another numerical approach is to perform
Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the full govern-
ing equations: the induction equation coupled with the
ﬂuid dynamical one by the Lorentz force, the ﬂow be-
ing sustained by a given force (or equivalently an aver-
age geometry). They have conﬁrmed that dynamo ac-
tion is present in ﬂows with diﬀerential rotations and
helicity [8, 9, 10]. However, DNS are at present re-
stricted to situations where the magnetic Prandtl num-
ber, Pm = ν/λ (where λ is the magnetic diﬀusivity) is
of order one, i.e. to situations where the smallest scales
of the magnetic and velocity ﬁelds have the same char-
acteristic size [11]. This is not the case in liquid metals,
which have very small magnetic Prandtl number values
10−5 for
e.g. Pm ∼
liquid Sodium. Recall that, below the dynamo threshold,

10−6 for liquid Gallium and Pm ∼

P

a stationary forced ﬂow with a power input ǫ (in Watts
(ν3/ǫ)1/4 and
per kg) has a viscous dissipative scale ηu ∼
(λ3/ǫ)1/4 — hence a ratio
a Joule diﬀusive scale ηB ∼
3/4
ηu/ηB ∼
m . Therefore, at low Pm, the magnetic dif-
fusive length scale is very much larger than the velocity
dissipative scale. If non-linear eﬀects are to develop, the
U L/λ (where U and
magnetic Reynolds number Rm ∼
L represent the characteristic velocity and scale of the
ﬂow) must be at least of order one and thus the kinetic
Reynolds number of the ﬂow, Re
Rm/Pm,
must be very large (turbulence is fully developed). A
DNS treatment of such a system is at present out of reach.

In this paper, we present a new approach for the study
of the magnetic induction in large Re - low Pm ﬂows; we
restrict ourselves to regimes below the dynamo threshold.
In this parameter region, the magnetic ﬁeld “lives” essen-
tially within the large and inertial hydrodynamic scales.
We thus propose to treat with a sub-grid model the veloc-
ity scales which are smaller than the magnetic diﬀusive
length. Schemes using hyperviscosity have previously
been used [4, 12]. Here, we prefer a LES approach, which
has proved very successful for the simulation of turbulent
ﬂows with large scale structures and for the modelling of
energy transfers [13].
In this hybrid scheme, we solve
the induction equation on a fully resolved grid and we
use a LES method for the velocity ﬁeld, with a cut-oﬀ
scale at the end of the magnetic diﬀusive range. We con-
sider the response of a conductive ﬂuid to an uniform
magnetic ﬁeld: topology of the mean induced ﬁeld and
spatio-temporal features of the magnetic ﬂuctuations are
studied. The chosen ﬂow is a forced Taylor-Green vortex
(TG). It shares many similarities with the experimen-
tal von K´arm´an swirling ﬂows which have already been
investigated in DNS near Pm ∼ O

In non-dimensional form, the incompressible MHD
equations have two classical control parameters, the mag-
netic and kinetic Reynolds numbers, and one has to

choose a forcing mechanism that generates the desired
values of Rm and Re.
In order to be closer to experi-
mental procedures, we prefer to ﬁx the driving force and
the magnetic Prandtl number. Hence, the dynamical
time t0 is set to the magnetic diﬀusion time scale, i.e.
t0λ/L2
(1), where L is a length scale characteristic
of the system size. Changes in magnetic diﬀusivity for
real ﬂuids would change that time scale. We write the
MHD equations, with constant unit density, as

where u is the velocity ﬁeld, B = B0 + b is the net

duced ﬁelds. Once the amplitude F of the driving force
is ﬁxed, the (non-dimensional) rms intensity of the ve-

of the induced ﬁeld on the velocity ﬁeld is negligeable.
The above expressions are only dimensional estimates; in
practice, the characteristic ﬂow quantities are computed
as mean temporal values from the data – cf. Table 1.
We use a parallelized pseudo-spectral code in a [0

2π]3
periodic box. Time stepping is done with an exponential
forward Euler-Adams-Bashford scheme. The LES model
is of the Chollet-Lesieur type [13] in which the kinematic
viscosity ν is replaced in spectral space by an eddy vis-
cosity. In Eq. (1) the magnetic Prandtl number is then
replaced by:

Ev(k = Kc, t)/Kc . (4)

Here Kc is the cut-oﬀ wavenumber of the velocity ﬁeld,
and Ev(k, t) is the one-dimensional kinetic energy spec-
trum. The eﬀective Prandtl number Pmeff is obtained as
the temporal mean of Pm(0, t). Note that the eﬀective
ﬂuid viscosity νeﬀ is of the same magnitude. A consis-
tency condition for our approach is that the magnetic
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are fully resolved when 2π/Kc is smaller
3/4
than the magnetic diﬀusive scale ηB ∼

the integral scale computed from the kinetic energy spec-
trum. The ﬂow is driven by the TG vortex geometry

(t < 10) the ﬂow has reached a steady state: the kinetic

Figure 1 shows the power spectra of the velocity and
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations with B0 applied along the
ˆx-axis (a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis
of the counter-rotating eddies of the TG cells). The
kinetic energy spectrum exhibits the k−5/3 Kolmogorov
scaling law maintained throughout the range by the
LES scheme. The peak at low wavenumber is due the
large scale TG forcing, also visible on the magnetic ﬁeld
spectrum. The magnetic inertial range is well ﬁtted by
a k−11/3 power law in agreement with a Kolmogorov
phenomenology [17, 18]. The magnetic diﬀusive scale is
reached within the computational box. The main goal
of our numerical strategy is thus achieved: the magnetic
ﬂuctuations are fully resolved in a range of scales
at which the velocity ﬁeld follows the Kolomogorov
self-similar structure of turbulence. Hence, we get
the possibility to study magnetic induction in a fully
developped turbulent ﬂow at low magnetic Prandtl
number.

netic energy,

linear approximation based on time averaged velocities:
λ
iT . This is similar to numeri-
cal studies based on the averaged ﬂow geometries [7, 19].
When B0 is applied along ˆz, in a direction parallel to
the rotation axis of the TG eddies, the most intense
magnetic energy structures are concentrated round the
z = π/2, 3π/2 planes, in agreement with the diﬀerential
rotation of the TG vortex. Moreover, the most intense
iT ﬁelds coin-
structures of
cide. For B0 along the ˆx-axis, one observes the main
induction concentration around the z = 0, π planes, as
expected from a direct inspection from the ﬂow forcing.
However, the most intense structures of the
iT
iT ﬁelds do not coincide everywhere in
and
that case (see location (π/2, π/2, 0) in Fig. 2(bottom),
for example). Note also that the linear calculation over-
estimates the time averaged magnetic ﬂuctuations, what-
ever the orientation of the applied ﬁeld. Altogether it
shows than one should be cautious when using average
velocity ﬁelds in the calculation of magnetic induction,
particularly if restricted to linear eﬀects. The diﬀerence
between the ﬁelds is probably linked to the large scale
electromotive force due to turbulent motions. The in-
ﬂuence of this force, as well as the large scale induction
topology and its connection with the small scale ﬂuctua-
tions, will be reported in a forthcoming paper [20].

ing local probes as in laboratory experiments. The inten-
sity of the induced magnetic ﬁeld has strong local ﬂuctu-
ations. The point at (0, π, 0) is in a region of strong mean
induction, whereas the point at (0.6π, 0.6π, 0.6π) is at lo-
cation of low mean induction (cf. Fig. 2(bottom)). We
observe that, occasionally, the induced ﬁeld gets larger
than the applied ﬁeld. In fact, if small amplitude ﬂuc-
tuations (about 10%) are induced over time intervals of

itative agreement with the experimental observations at
comparable Rm and Pm [14, 15, 16, 18]. In order to be
more quantitative, we analyze the time spectra; we fo-
cus on the case with B0 applied along the ˆx-axis, but
the results are identical when B0 is along ˆz. We plot
in Figure 4 the power spectra of the temporal ﬂuctua-
tions of the magnetic ﬁeld component bx(x, t) recorded
at (0, π, 0). The higher end of the time spectrum follows
a behavior close to f −11/3, as can be expected from the
spatial spectrum using the Taylor hypothesis of “frozen”
ﬁeld lines advected by the mean ﬂow [18]. In addition,
for frequencies roughly between 1/t0 and 1/10t0, the time
spectrum develops a 1/f behavior, as observed in experi-
mental measurements [15]. It is not present on the spatial
spectrum in Figure 1, and thus appears as a distinctive
feature of the time dynamics of the induced ﬁeld. It is
also independant of dynamo action, as it is also observed
in the Karlsruhe experiments [16]. Finally, our numerical

a global feature. It is observed on the ﬂuctuations of the
magnetic energy, as shown in Figure 5 (as a f −2 scaling
regime). We thus propose that it results from induction
processes which have contributions up to the largest scale
in the system.

We have considered here the response to an externally
applied ﬁeld. The time behavior of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctu-
ations is found in excellent agreement with experimental
measurements. It has also revealed that the 1/f regime
detected locally traces back to the global dynamics of
the ﬂow. Future work will analyze the contribution of
turbulent ﬂuctuations to the large scale magnetic ﬁeld
dynamics, and the inﬂuence of the magnetic Prandtl
number on the threshold of the dynamo instability.

SHARP LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE DIMENSION OF THE GLOBAL
ATTRACTOR OF THE SABRA SHELL MODEL OF TURBULENCE

PETER CONSTANTIN, BORIS LEVANT, AND EDRISS S. TITI

ABSTRACT. In this work we derive a lower bounds for the Hausdorff and fractal dimen-
sions of the global attractor of the Sabra shell model of turbulence in different regimes of
parameters. We show that for a particular choice of the forcing and for sufﬁciently small
viscosity term n
, the Sabra shell model has a global attractor of large Hausdorff and fractal
1 for all values of the governing parameter e , except for
dimensions proportional to logl
e = 1. The obtained lower bounds are sharp, matching the upper bounds for the dimension
of the global attractor obtained in our previous work. Moreover, we show different scenar-
ios of the transition to chaos for different parameters regime and for speciﬁc forcing. In
the “three-dimensional” regime of parameters this scenario changes when the parameter e
becomes sufﬁciently close to 0 or to 1. We also show that in the “two-dimensional” regime
of parameters for a certain non-zero forcing term the long-time dynamics of the model
becomes trivial for any value of the viscosity.

1. INTRODUCTION

Shell models of turbulence have attracted interest as useful phenomenological models
that retain certain features of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE). In this work we continue
our analytical study of the Sabra shell model of turbulence that was introduced in [14]. For
other shell models see [4], [9], [8], [17]. A recent review of the subject emphasizing the ap-
plications of the shell models to the study of the energy-cascade mechanism in turbulence
can be found in [2].

The Sabra shell model of turbulence describes the evolution of complex Fourier-like
components of a scalar velocity ﬁeld denoted by un. The associated one-dimensional
wavenumbers are denoted by kn, where the discrete index n is referred to as the “shell
index”. The equations of motion of the Sabra shell model of turbulence have the following
form

with l > 1 being the shell spacing parameter, and k0 > 0. Although the equation does not

capture any geometry, we will consider L = k−
0 as a ﬁxed typical length scale of the model.
In an analogy with the Navier-Stokes equations, n > 0 represents a kinematic viscosity and
fn are the Fourier components of the forcing.

The three parameters of the model a, b and c are real.

In order for the Sabra shell
model to be a system of the hydrodynamic type we require that in the inviscid (n = 0) and
unforced ( fn = 0, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ) case the model will have at least one quadratic invariant.
Requiring conservation of the energy

n=1|
leads to the following relation between the parameters of the model, which we will refer to
as an energy conservation condition

E =

a + b + c = 0.

(3)

Moreover, in the inviscid and unforced case the model possesses another quadratic invari-
ant

W =

(cid:19)
The Sabra shell model (1) has the following 6 parameters: n , l , k0, a, b, and c. However,
1
the “characteristic length-scale” k−
0 does not appear on its own, but only in the following
combinations: k0a, k0b, and k0c. Therefore, without loss of generality we may assume that
k0 = 1. Next, by rescaling the time

Therefore, the Sabra shell model is in fact a three-parameter family of equations with
parameters n > 0, e , and l > 1. In most of the numerical investigations of the shell models
the parameter l was set to l = 2 (see [4], [14]). The physically relevant range of parameters
> 1, or equivalently, 0 < e < 2 (see [14] for details). For 0 < e < 1 the quantity W is
is
not sign-deﬁnite and therefore it is common to associate it with the helicity – in an analogy
to the 3D turbulence. The 2D parameters regime corresponds to 1 < e < 2, for which the
quantity W becomes positive. In that case the second conserved quadratic quantity W is
identiﬁed with the enstrophy – in analogy to the 3D turbulence.

Classical theories of turbulence assert that the turbulent ﬂows governed by the Navier-
Stokes equations have ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom (see, e.g., [8], [12]). Arguing in
the same vein one can state that the sabra shell model with non-zero viscosity has ﬁnitely
many degrees of freedom. One of the ways to interpret such a physical statement mathe-
matically is to assume that the number of degrees of freedom of the model corresponds to
the Hausdorff or fractal dimension of its global attractor. In our previous study of the Sabra
shell model of turbulence ([5]) we proved the existence of a global attractor for the model
and provided explicit upper bounds of its Hausdorff and fractal dimensions. Therefore,
we proved that indeed the long-time dynamics of the sabra shell model with non-zero vis-
cosity has effectively ﬁnitely many degrees of freedom. The question remains how many?
The main motivation behind this work is to provide a lower bound for the Hausdorff and
fractal dimensions of the global attractor. Namely, to show that for the particular choice
of the forcing term, and for all e
= 1, the Hausdorff and fractal dimensions of
the global attractor are large, proportional to the upper bound obtained previously in [5].
However, we also give an example of the forcing such that for e
(0, 1) and any non-zero
viscosity n

, the long-time dynamics of the Sabra shell model of turbulence is trivial.
In our work, we show that the Sabra shell model of turbulence possesses a global attrac-

analytical justiﬁcation for the numerical results observed in [19] and [20] for e = 1/2,
and e = 3/2, which corresponds respectively to the purely “three” and “two-dimensional”
values of parameters.

Moreover, in Section 4, we obtain an estimate of the dimension of the global attractor

The right hand side of the inequality was proved in [5], and is true for every forcing term
f. In this work we show that this estimate is tight in the sense that for particular choices of
the forcing term f the lower bound in (5) is achieved.

Furthermore, in Section 4.1, we study the linear stability of the stationary solution of
the Sabra shell model, concentrated on a single mode N. We show that it becomes unstable
for every N and for small enough viscosity for all e
= 1, thus correcting a result
of [11]. By considering a stationary solution concentrated on an inﬁnite number of shells,
we are able to demonstrate exactly how the transition to chaos occurs both in the “two” and
“three-dimensional” parameters regime, through successive bifurcations, as the viscosity n
tends to zero.

(0, 2), e

In the “three-dimensional” regime e

(0, 1), when the parameter e becomes close to
0 or 1 the scenario of the transition to chaos is different than in the rest of the interval.
Namely, for a ﬁxed viscosity, when e crosses the values 0.05 and 0.97, the dimension of
the unstable manifold of the certain stationary solution drops by a factor of 3. However, the
1, the chaotic behavior
attractor in those regimes is still of the size proportional to logl
in the vicinity of the particular stationary solution changes dramatically.

n −

∈

Finally in Section 5, we show that in the “two-dimensional” parameters regime the
Sabra shell model has a trivial attractor reduced to a single equilibrium solution for any
value of viscosity n
, when the forcing is applied only to the ﬁrst shell. This result is
similar to the one for the 2-dimensional NSE due to Yudovich [22] and independently by
Marchioro [15].

The transition to chaos in the GOY shell model of turbulence was studied previously in
[3] and [10] by investigating numerically the stability properties of the special stationary
1/3 Kolmogorov’s scaling
solution corresponding to the single mode forcing, which has a k−
in the inertial range. It was found that this solution becomes unstable at e = 0.3843, and at
some value of e
the phase transition occurs, when many stable directions become suddenly
unstable. In this work we show that the nature of the transition to chaos strongly depends
on the type of the forcing chosen.

First, we give a brief introduction to the mathematical formulations of the Sabra shell

model problem. More details on this subject could be found in [5] and [6].

original one by assuming that both the forcing fn and the velocity components un in the
equation (1) are purely imaginary. Our goal in this work is to show that the upper bounds
of the Hausdorff and fractal dimensions of the global attractor of the Sabra shell model
obtained in [5] are optimal in the sense that they can be achieved for some speciﬁc choice
of the forcing. Therefore, this formulation of the model is not restrictive, as long as we are
able to show in that case that the size of the global attractor matches the upper bound of
[5].

3. LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE DIMENSION OF THE GLOBAL ATTRACTOR – THE

“TWO-DIMENSIONAL” PARAMETER REGIME

The Hausdorff and fractal dimensions of the global attractor of the evolution equation
are bounded from below by the dimension of the unstable manifold of every stationary
solution (see, e.g., [1], [18]). Therefore, in order to derive the lower bound for the Haus-
dorff and fractal dimensions of the global attractor of the Sabra shell model equation we

will construct a speciﬁc stationary solution of the equation (6) and count the number of the
linearly unstable directions of that equilibrium. The same technique was ﬁrst used in [16]
(see also [1], [13]) to obtain lower bounds for the dimension of the Navier-Stokes global
attractor in 2D. In this section we will consider the “two-dimensional” parameters regime
of the Sabra shell model corresponding to

turbulence has a global attractor, which is a compact subspace of the space V . Later in this
section we will specify how large the number M should be.

Proof. Fix M to be large enough, and let N < M be such that N = 1 mod 3. Suppose, that
for such N the condition (20) is satisﬁed for certain s = s (N), depending on N, for which
Re(s ) > 0. Then, for such s
, there exists a solution of equation (19), and in particular,
there exists a solution of the eigenvalue problem (12) with Re(s ) > 0. Moreover, it is not
hard to see that if N1
= N2, then the solutions of the eigenvalue problem (12) corresponding
to s (N1) and s (N2) are different.

Therefore, for a given M, in order to count the number of unstable directions of the
stationary solution (10), we need to count the number of N-s, such that (i) N < M; (ii)
N = 1 mod 3; (iii) N satisﬁes (20) with the eigenvalue s

4. LOWER BOUNDS FOR THE DIMENSION OF THE GLOBAL ATTRACTOR – THE

“THREE-DIMENSIONAL” PARAMETERS REGIME

The result obtained in the previous section did not give an answer for the case

0 < e < 1,
which is also known as the “three-dimensional” range of parameters. Therefore, we will
need to apply different strategy. First, we will consider the linear stability of a stationary
solution, corresponding to the force acting on a single mode number N, for some N > 0.
We will show that for every choice of N, and for every value of the parameter e
(0, 2],
= 1, such a stationary solution becomes linearly unstable for sufﬁciently small viscosity
. The stability of a single-mode stationary solution was numerically studied previously in

proof contradicts this numerical observation.

Next, we will construct a special type of an equilibrium solution, for which we will be
able to count the number of unstable directions. The draw-back of this method is that we
are not able to obtain the exact dependance of the bounds on the parameters of the problem

4.2. Calculating the lower bound of the dimension of the attractor. In the previous
section we show that the Sabra shell model has at most three unstable direction for the
“single-mode” forcing. Therefore, we need other type of the force to get a large number of
unstable direction, and ﬁnally, the lower-bound for the dimension of the global attractor,
which would be close to the upper-bound calculated in [5]. Let us deﬁne the forcing

where f5 j is deﬁned in (25). Then the stationary solution corresponding to that forcing is

single-mode stationary solution we conclude that for 0 < e < 1, the number of the unstable
directions of the solution ug equals to 3N/5, where N satisﬁes the relation (32). On the
other hand, the number of the unstable directions of the solution ug for 1 < e < 2 equals to
2N/5, where N satisﬁes relation (34).

5. EXISTENCE OF A TRIVIAL GLOBAL ATTRACTOR FOR ANY VALUE OF n

It is well known that the attractor for the 2-dimensional space-periodic Navier-Stokes
equation with a particular form of the forcing can consists of only one function. This
well-known example is due to Yudovich [22] and independently by Marchioro [15] (for
the proof see also [7]). The same is true for the Sabra shell model for 1 < e < 2, therefore,
we need to stress that the bounds that we obtained for the dimension of the global attractor
are valid only for the particular type of forcing that we used in our calculations.

We mentioned in the introduction that for the 2-dimensional parameters regime the

inviscid Sabra shell model without forcing conserves the following quantity

6. CONCLUSION

In this work we obtained lower bounds for the dimension of the global attractor of the
Sabra shell model of turbulence for speciﬁc choices of the forcing term. Our main result
states that for these speciﬁc choices of the forcing term the Sabra shell model has a large
attractor for all values of the governing parameter e
. We also showed the
scenario of the transition to chaos in the model, which is slightly different for the two- and

regime, e
(0, 1), we found that when the parameter e becomes sufﬁciently close to 0 or to
1 where the chaotic behavior in the vicinity of the stationary solution changes dramatically.
Finally, we show that in the “two-dimensional” parameters regime the Sabra shell model
has a trivial attractor reduced to a single equilibrium solution for any value of viscosity n
,
when the forcing is applied only to the ﬁrst shell. This result is true also for the two-
dimensional NSE due to Yudovich [22] and independently by Marchioro [15] (see also
[7]).

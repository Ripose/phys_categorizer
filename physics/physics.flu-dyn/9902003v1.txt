Abstract

The two-dimensional ﬂow of viscous incompressible liquid in a square cavity with

a free boundary and diﬀerentially heated vertical sides is considered in the present

work. The inﬂuence of gravitational and thermocapillary convection on temperature

and velocity ﬁelds is studied in large range of dimensionless parameters and similarity

criteria using equations in a Boussinesq approximation. Limiting cases of dimension-

less parameters are analyzed numerically.

Introduction

It is known that in the nonuniformly heated ﬂuid motion appears. Without free

boundaries it appears due to thermal (gravitational) convection. In the nonuniformly

heated liquid with a free boundary there arises thermocapillary convection [1], [2].

Under the low gravity condition it is necessary to take into account both of these

processes.

It is interesting to analyze the inﬂuence of these factors on heat ﬂuxes

and velocity ﬁelds formation under the non-gravity condition and with an increase in

gravity.

We will consider a plane stationary convectional system with a side heating. Such

equipment, various energy plants [2], [3]. That is why the knowledge of ﬂow and heat

ﬂuxes structure in the large dimensionless parameters range (Rayleigh Ra, Prandtl

P r and Marangoni Ma numbers) is of scientiﬁc and practical interest.

Model

diﬀusivity.

Calculations with various Prandtl and Marangoni numbers were carried out. Two

In the present work the following boundary conditions are considered (Fig.1). The

Method of solution

Formulation of the problem (1 – 3), as many other problems of viscous incompressible

only inside the domain according to the Eq. (2). To overcome this diﬃculty various

approaches are used, for example, approximate boundary conditions for vorticity. In

the present work we use the Toma condition for ω on the wall [5]:

ωk =

2(ψk+1 −
∆h2

ψk)

+ O(∆h).

(13)

Here ∆h denotes the mesh size, ψk is the value of the stream function in the boundary

node k, ψk+1 is is the value of ψ in the node k + 1 nearest to the wall.

Calculations were also performed with the second order boundary condition for

ω, namely, Woods condition. Computational results with these diﬀerent conditions

are almost the same. However, the use of the approximate boundary conditions for

vorticity on the wall for the Eqs. (1 – 3) at high Marangoni numbers and on ﬁne

meshes leads to the considerable slowing-down of the convergence. That is why we

also used the boundary conditions calculation method [6], which allowed us to improve

the convergence in 2

4 times, and in some cases on the order in comparison with

the use of the Toma formula.

−

Idea of this method is to determine the boundary condition for vorticity inside

the main domain, where ω is deﬁned according to (2). Equation for ω (1) is solved in

the auxiliary domain. The solid boundaries of this domain are displaced on the mesh

size into the cavity from the solid boundaries of the main domain. The free surface

y = 1 is common for these domains. On the free surface vorticity is determined as

follows:
|y=1 = ∂u
Stream function and temperature equations are solved in the main domain. There

∂y |y=1 =

∂x |y=1.

are two boundary conditions for the stream function. The condition ψ0 = 0 is used to

solve equation for ψ. The obtained stream function ﬁeld does not satisfy the gradient
condition ( ∂ψ

the auxiliary domain are corrected with the help of the diﬀerence analog of this

When approximating Eqs. (1, 3) and (10, 12) for temperature and vorticity ex-

ponential ﬁtting discretization (or scheme of integral identities) was used [7], [8]. It

allowed us to obtain a higher precision in comparison with the usual approxima-

tions. As a result, a ﬁve-point algebraic system was carried out. Equations for ω

and T do not satisfy the diagonal dominance condition. It is known that without

this condition, many eﬀective methods fail to converge or converge very slowly. In

the present work modiﬁcation of Buleev’s method [9] and a splitting method [10] are

used. They enable to ﬁnd a solution of the system without a diagonal dominance

property. Buleev’s method modiﬁcation converges faster than the splitting method

when the stream function and the temperature equations are solved. But for the

vorticity equation with high Marangoni numbers (Ma > 102) Buleev’s method does

not converge to the necessary precision (namely, 1.e

7). Thus the equation for ω

−

was solved by splitting which enables to obtain the prescribed precision.

To improve convergence the damping operation for vorticity was used. It is de-

termined by the following recurrent relation:

to 106. Two limiting cases: Ma

were also considered. Results

are presented in Figures (2-11) and in Tables I and II on the 61

61 mesh. Results

at the Marangoni number Ma = 104 are not very reliable as the calculating scheme

converges badly at this value of dimensionless parameter.

the surface tension force is equal to zero (Fig.2a), there is no convection, and the ﬂuid

rests. With an increase in the Marangoni number the convective mixing enhances,

and at Ma = 104 the ﬂow becomes vortical. One can see from Figures 2b, 2c, 2d,

that the greater Ma, the stronger the contour maps deﬂect and are pressed to the hot

and cold walls. Near these walls temperature boundary layers appear. The boundary

layer near the hot wall is wider than near the cold. One characteristic property of the

picture is the condensation of contour maps to the upper right corner of the cavity,

to the region near the free surface and the cold wall. In the center of the domain

a vortex is formed. Contour maps on Figure 2 correspond to the Prandtl number

P r = 1. Figure 3 shows temperature contour maps at P r =

(that is the case of the

strongly viscous ﬂuid, Eqs. (7 – 9)). Behavior near the free surface y = 1 is diﬀerent

for the corresponding contour maps of Figures 2 and 3. In the case of the strongly

viscous ﬂuid contour maps come normally to the free surface and remain undeﬂected

near it longer than in the case of P r = 1. The explanation is that it is more diﬃcult for

the surface tension force to mix more viscous ﬂuid. From the comparison of contour

maps at Ma = 104 (Figures 2d and 3c) one can see that at P r = 1 a vortex region is

larger and extend almost over the entire domain. At P r =

the vortex is situated

closer to the free surface, convective ﬂow in the entire domain is weaker. Thus the

more viscosity of the ﬂuid, the weaker convection there at the same surface tension

force.

Figure 4 presents the inﬂuence of the gravity (Ra) on the temperature ﬁeld. An-

alyzing the results, we can say that with the increase in Rayleigh number the whole

picture of the ﬂow becomes more complex, convection mixing of the ﬂuid intensiﬁes,

the vortical structure of the stream and narrow boundary layers with the sharp tem-

perature diﬀerence across the boundary layer near the hot and cold walls appear.

Comparison of corresponding contour maps of Figures 2 and 4 shows that the surface

tension force tends to form a vortex in the center of the domain and to condense the

contour maps to the upper part of the cold wall; whereas the force of gravity tends

to form a vortex closer to the boundary of the cavity, remaining its center without

a vortex, and to condense the contour maps to the vertical walls. At Ra = 106 two

narrow boundary layers near the vertical sides of the width

0,85 the contour maps are located at a greater distance and the

≈

temperature gradient points vertically upwards. Such behavior of the temperature

contour maps inﬂuences the stream function ﬁeld. One can see from Figure 5d for the

ψ contour maps (Ra = 106) that near the vertical walls contour maps condense, and

two narrow boundary layers with the sharp diﬀerence of stream function values across

the boundary layer are formed. In the remaining part of the calculation domain the

contour maps are located at a greater distance. At Ra = 105 (Fig.5c) the secondary

ﬂows are formed in the center of the domain.

Table I shows an increase in the maximum value of velocity module √u2 + v2 and

the change in its location with an increase in the Rayleigh number. At Ra

105 this

≤

maximum is situated on the free surface, and the greater Ra, the closer the maximum

to the hot wall. At Ra = 106 the maximum value of √u2 + v2 is located close to the

center of the hot wall.

Dependence of the maximum value location of √u2 + v2 on the Marangoni number

was built (Fig.6). For all considered Ma numbers the maximum value of velocity

module is situated on the free surface. With an increase in Ma it moves to the upper

right corner, the common point of the cold wall and the free surface. For a more

viscous ﬂuid this maximum is located closer to the hot wall for the same Marangoni

numbers.

It is evident that the surface tension force tends to move the vortex to

the upper boundary of the cold wall, and it is more diﬃcult to mix more viscous

Marangoni numbers. A high precision is necessary for the calculation of the ﬂow at

the Marangoni numbers Ma

104. Such precision could not be obtained with the

help of the proposed scheme.

≥

Figure 7 presents the contour maps of stream function at P r = 1, Ra = 0 for

various Marangoni numbers. With an increase in Ma the contour maps begin to

come closer to the upper corners, and in the lower corners the secondary ﬂows appear.

With the increase in the Marangoni number the inner vortex domain increases, and

the contour maps value module corresponding to this vortex decreases. The contour

maps condense near the free surface.

Figure 8 shows ψ contour maps for the strongly viscous ﬂuid at diﬀerent Marangoni

numbers. One can see from a comparison of Figures 7 and 8 that in more viscous

ﬂuid the convective ﬂow in the entire calculation domain is weaker, vortex is located

closer to the free surface and vortex’s region is less; there are no secondary ﬂows in

the lower corners of the domain.

Let us compare Figures 7a (P r = 1, Ma = 102, Ra = 0) and 5a (P r = 1, Ma =

102, Ra = 103). With the appearance of the thermal gravitational convection the

contour maps shape changes. The lower parts of the contour maps are located closer

to the bottom of the domain, and contour maps tend to the lower corners. It is the

result of the gravity force inﬂuence. The greater Ra, the stronger the inﬂuence of

the gravity force in comparison with the surface tension force on the character of the

ﬂow. Thus at Ra = 103, Ma = 102 (Fig.5) the contour maps also tend to the upper

right corner, i.e. the thermocapillary convection considerably inﬂuences the contour

maps shape. With the further increase in Ra the gravitational convection becomes

dominant. Beginning from Ra = 105 the secondary ﬂows are formed. One of them

tends to the upper left corner of the cavity, to the hot wall, another - to the lower

right corner, to the cold wall (Fig.5b, 5c, 5d).

Calculations of the convection problem under the non-gravity condition with the

∂u

surface tension force equal to zero (Eqs. (4 – 6) with the zero boundary condition
∂y |y=1 = 0) were made. Here no forces operate on the ﬂuid, there is no convection,
and all proﬁles of stream function, velocities and vorticity at various sections of the

calculation domain are almost zero. The temperature contour maps in this case are

Calculations of the convection problem without gravitation were also carried out

with the following parameters: Ma = 1; 0,1; 0,01; 0,001; P r = 1. With the decrease

in the Marangoni number the stream function and velocity proﬁles tend monotonously

to the zero values, to the proﬁles of the limiting case Ma = 0. The temperature

contour maps also tend monotonously to the contour maps of the case Ma = 0 with

the decrease in Ma.

Another limiting case: P r

for various Marangoni numbers (Eqs. (7 – 9))

→ ∞

under the non-gravity condition was also considered. Computational results show

that for every Marangoni number between 0 and 10 the ﬂow does not depend on the

Prandtl number (at P r between 1 and

). At Ma = 102 and P r from 10 to

the

corresponding proﬁles of the ﬂow agree (Fig.3a (temperature contour maps), Fig.8a

(contour maps of ψ)), but diﬀer from the ﬂow proﬁles at the Prandtl number P r = 1

(Fig.2b, 7a). A similar situation takes place at Ma = 103 (Fig.2c, 7b; 3b, 8b). At

Ma = 104 and P r = 100,

the proﬁles are close to each other and diﬀer from the

ﬂow proﬁles at P r = 10.

For the heat balance control the average Nusselt numbers on the hot and cold

walls and on the vertical mid-plane of the cavity were calculated. The local Nusselt

number Nu(x, y) at the point (x, y) and the average Nusselt number Nux0 on the

section x = x0 are determined as follows:

of the free surface, Nu0, Nu1/2, Nu1 designate the average Nuselt numbers on the

sections x = 0, x = 1/2, x = 1 respectively. The obtained results were compared

with [11]. In the work [11] a high accuracy scheme was used to solve Eqs. (1 – 3).

errors, particularly at Ma = 104.

Dependencies of the average Nusselt numbers on the Prandtl, Marangoni and

Rayleigh numbers (Fig.9, 10 and 11 respectively) were also calculated. Fig.9 shows

that the greater the Marangoni number for the same Prandtl number (i.e.

the

stronger thermocapillary convection), the stronger heat-removing. At Ma between

0 and 102 the heat-removing coeﬃcient does not change with the increase in P r. At

Ma = 103; 104 and from P r = 10 this coeﬃcient takes some constant value, and

every Marangoni number has its own value. Besides, at Ma between 103 and 104 an

abrupt increase in the Nusselt number is observed, especially for the case P r = 1.

Probably, the reason for it lies in the appearance of a more complex structure of the

ﬂow and in the loss of it the stability [11], which lead to the sharp increase in heat-

removing. Such an abrupt increase in heat-removing is also observed in Fig.10, which

presents dependence of Nu on Ma for various Prandtl numbers. The Nusselt number

increases with the growth of the Rayleigh number, which characterizes the intensity

in the Nusselt number also occurs because of the appearance of a more complex ﬂow

structure. Figures 10, 11 present functions that are the parameter approximations of

dependences of the Nusselt number on the hot wall on the Rayleigh number at Ra

between 105 and 106 and on the Marangoni number at Ma between 103 and 104. In

2. With the increase in the gravity force the whole picture of the ﬂow becomes more

complex, convection mixing of the ﬂuid intensiﬁes, narrow boundary layers with the

sharp temperature and velocity diﬀerence across the boundary layer close to the hot

occurs.

In a more viscous ﬂuid the convective ﬂow in the entire calculation domain is

weaker, vortexes are located closer to the free surface and vortexes region is less.

Computational results show that with the decrease in the Marangoni number the ﬂow

proﬁles tend monotonously to the ﬂow proﬁles of the case Ma = 0. Ranges of the

dimensionless parameters where the ﬂow does not change were also determined.

wall on the Rayleigh number at Ra between 105 and 106 and on the Marangoni

number at Ma between 103 and 104 were built.

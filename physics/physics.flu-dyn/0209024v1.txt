Variational derivation of Newtonian multi-ﬂuid hydrodynamics

(Dated: Sept. 5, 2002)

We present a formalism to derive Newtonian multi-ﬂuid hydrodynamics from a “convective”
variational principle, which was initially introduced in general relativity by Taub and subsequently
largely developed by Carter.

This method provides a straightforward way to obtain the general form of the equations of motion
for a wide range of hydrodynamic systems containing an arbitrary number of interacting charged
and uncharged ﬂuids and superﬂuids. The use of time shifts in addition to purely spatial variations
allows us further to describe even dissipative processes that lead to entropy creation, for example
chemical reactions, friction or the presence of external non-conservative forces.

In order to illustrate the generality of this framework we explicitly discuss its application to
perfect ﬂuids, thermally and electrically conducting ﬂuids, superﬂuid 4He, neutron star matter and
superconductors.

INTRODUCTION

2

The main purpose of this work is to present a formalism that allows us to ﬁnd the equations of motion for a
very general class of multi-constituent systems of interacting charged or uncharged “ﬂuids”, such as conducting and
non-conducting ﬂuids, multi-ﬂuid plasmas, superﬂuids and superconductors.

The device we use to achieve this is the so-called “convective” variational principle, which was ﬁrst introduced in
the context of general relativity by Taub [36], and has subsequently been greatly developed and extended (still in the
framework of general relativity) by Carter [6, 7]. This method was also developed independently by Kijowski [21] for
the variational description of perfect ﬂuids in general relativity.

Although a “translation” of this formalism into a Newtonian framework is already available [8, 10] (albeit in the
not very well-known spacetime-covariant language close to general relativity) this powerful and ﬂexible machinery
does not yet seem to have been exploited or even “discovered” in conventional Newtonian hydrodynamics. To our
knowledge the only instance of an (independent) use of the convective variational principle in Newtonian physics is
in a derivation of the hydrodynamic Vlasov equations for a multi-ﬂuid plasma [39]. The present work substantially
extends and generalizes our earlier application of this variational principle to Newtonian hydrodynamics [30].

The “quest” of ﬁnding a variational description for Newtonian hydrodynamics is a long-standing problem that never
seems to have found a quite as satisfactory and general solution as in classical mechanics. The reason for this can be
traced to the nature of the hydrodynamic equations (e.g. Euler equation), which are ﬁrst order in time equations in
the Eulerian quantities density ρ and velocity v, where the information about the underlying ﬂuid particles has been
dropped. Fluid particle trajectories, i.e. ﬂowlines, can still be recovered by integrating the velocity ﬁeld, but they are
no longer part of Eulerian description. Consider for example the Lagrangian density Λ for a perfect ﬂuid, which one
would obtain from a “particle Lagrangian” by averaging and introducing the Eulerian variables ρ and v, namely

Λ(ρ, v) =

Requiring the action
e
µ = v2/2. In fact, it has been shown [34] that no
this leads to the over-constrained equations of motion ρv = 0 and
unconstrained variational principle can produce the Eulerian hydrodynamic equations. The reason for this is rather
intuitive, as it is evident that free variations of density and velocity probe conﬁgurations with diﬀerent masses (i.e.
diﬀerent numbers of particles), which is not an actual degree of freedom of the dynamics of the system. Therefore the
variational principle has to be constrained in some way in order to restrict the variations to the dynamically accessible
degrees of freedom.

e

The standard approach to this problem in Newtonian physics has been to supplement the Lagrangian with appro-
priate constraints using Lagrange multipliers. This method was pioneered by Zilsel [42] in the context of the two-ﬂuid
model for superﬂuid 4He, who used the constraints of conserved particles (i.e. mass) and entropy. However, as pointed
out by Lin [24], this is still generally insuﬃcient, as it results in equations of motion restricted to irrotational ﬂow
in the case of uniform entropy. Lin showed that one has to add a further constraint, namely one of “conservation
of identity” of ﬂuid particles in order to obtain the correct general hydrodynamic equations. If we label particles
with their positions a at some initial instant, then we can write their trajectories as x = x(a, t). The famous “Lin
constraint” now simply reads ∂ta + v
the “identity” of a particle is conserved under its transport.
For a review of this approach and its relation to the “Clebsch representation” we refer the reader to [32, 35, 41],
and references therein. Although these methods can be made to produce the correct equations of hydrodynamics in
particular cases, they seem less “natural” than the convective variational principle we will present here, and are also
less readily generalizable, in particular to multi-ﬂuid and dissipative contexts.

∇a = 0, i.e.

·

The convective variational principle implements the constraints in a diﬀerent way, not by adding explicit Lagrange
multipliers, but rather by directly restricting the variations of density and velocity. Namely, instead of free variations,
we consider δρ and δv to be induced by variations of the underlying ﬂuid ﬂowlines, i.e. the (ﬂuid) particle trajectories.
Intuitively this appears the most “natural” approach, in the sense that the classical variational principle developed
by Lagrange is based exactly on variations of particle trajectories. The equations of hydrodynamics are obviously

3

not describing a “diﬀerent physics” from classical particle mechanics, they are basically a smooth-averaged version
of Newton’s law in new variables. In this sense we can consider Λ as an averaged particle Lagrangian in the new
variables ρ and v. Therefore Newton’s law, i.e. the equations of hydrodynamics, should naturally still correspond
to stationarity of the action with respect to variations of the (ﬂuid) particle trajectories. This reasoning leads us
directly to the convective variational principle, which in this sense only represents a reformulation of the classical
action principle. We can therefore expect that the resulting equations of motion are Newton’s law applied to the
. It is interesting to note that this approach implicitly
system under consideration for the given equation of state
satisﬁes Lin’s constraint, as we are varying the particle trajectories x(a, t), along which a is a constant by deﬁnition.
Also, we do not need to impose any a-priori constraints on the conservation of mass or the number of particles, as
these are automatically satisﬁed by convective variations: shifting around ﬂowlines obviously conserves the number
of ﬂowlines, and therefore the number of particles.

E

As an illustration, we sketch how this variational principle works in the simplest example, namely the single
constituent perfect ﬂuid. The expressions for density- and velocity-variations induced by inﬁnitesimal spatial dis-
placements ξ of the ﬂowlines are well known (e.g. see [18]), and read1

e

The spatial variations ξ have three degrees of freedom, resulting in one vector equation that basically represents
the conservation of momentum. In order to complete the description we need a fourth variational degree of freedom
that should result in the missing energy equation. This can be achieved by considering “time” variations, which are a
natural part of the covariant relativistic approach, but which we have to be considered explicitly in the conventional
“3+1” language of Newtonian space-time. It is only these time-variations that allow will us to take this formalism to
its full generality, as we can now also describe dissipative processes with entropy creation, particle transformations
(i.e. “chemical reactions”), resistive “frictional” forces etc. These dissipative systems are still conservative if one
includes entropy, which is why they can be described by an action principle. The second law of thermodynamics is
of course not contained in the action principle and has to be imposed as an additional equation on the level of the
equations of motion. We note that the form of the equations to be derived will also allow for non-conservative forces
like viscosity, but an explicit discussion of this is postponed to future work. The same applies for extensions of this
formalism to include elasticity and electric or magnetic susceptibilities. Further work is also necessary to allow for the
macroscopic treatment of quantized vortices in superﬂuids, as this requires an extension of the variational principle
as shown in [11]. With the present formalism one can describe superﬂuids either on the “local” irrotational level, or
on the smooth-averaged macroscopic level by neglecting the (generally small) anisotropy induced by the quantized
vortices.

The plan of this paper is as follows: in Sect. II we derive the general form of the equations of motion for multi-
constituent systems using the convective variational principle.
In Sect. III we show the “total” conservation laws
implied by these equations, namely the conservation of charge, mass, energy and momentum. We further ﬁnd
quantities that are conserved under transport by the ﬂow in Sect. IV, namely the (canonical) vorticity and helicity.
We then develop the explicit functional form of the Lagrangian density for “hydrodynamic” systems in Sect. V, and in
Sect. VI we discuss several applications of the foregoing formalism to particular physical systems. These applications
have the two-fold purpose of demonstrating the generality of the present framework, as well as serving as “working
examples” of its application.

1 A derivation of these expressions is also found in Appendix.

II. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF MULTI-CONSTITUENT SYSTEMS

A. Kinematics

We describe a system of several constituents labelled in some way, and we use late capital letters X , Y , ... as indices
to run over all constituents labels. The fundamental quantities of the kinematic description are the constituent
densities nX and the associated transport currents nX , which are related to the respective velocities vX as

nX = nX vX , where X

constituent labels
}

.

∈ {

Not all constituents can necessarily move independently from each other, i.e. not all velocities vX have to be diﬀerent:
viscosity and friction due to particle collisions on the microscopic level can eﬀectively “bind” constituents together
on very short timescales. We therefore distinguish between the notions of constituents X , characterizing classes of
microscopic particles, and “ﬂuids”, which are sets of constituents with a common velocity.

We note that in this framework entropy can be described very naturally as a constituent for which we reserve the

label X = s, and we write

where s is the entropy density. The fact that the entropy density has diﬀerent dimensions than, say, a particle number
density, is unimportant: any density of a thermodynamically extensive quantity is allowed. However, in most practical
applications this will be limited to particle number and entropy density. In the present context it is instructive to
think of the entropy content as a gas of particle-like thermal excitations (e.g. phonons, rotons etc.), which makes its
description as a “ﬂuid” on the same footing with particle number densities quite natural.

The dynamics of the system is governed by a “hydrodynamic” Lagrangian density ΛH which depends on all the
densities and currents, namely ΛH = ΛH(nX , nX ). This deﬁnes the dynamical particle quantities pX
0 (“energy”) and
pX (“momentum”) as the canonically conjugate variables to the densities nX and currents nX , namely by the total
diﬀerential of ΛH:

where here and in the following the sum over repeated constituent indices is indicated by
summation convention applies to constituent indices.

, i.e. no automatic

We can further generalize the description to include gauge-ﬁelds which are “minimally coupled” to the matter, and
we restrict our attention to the two most relevant instances in practice, namely gravitation and electromagnetism.
Gravitation is described by the gauge ﬁeld Φ, and the coupling constants are the masses per (ﬂuid-) particle mX ,
while electromagnetism derives from the gauge ﬁelds A0 and A and is coupled to matter through the charges per
particle qX . In its present form this description is restricted to magnetically and electrically non-susceptible ﬂuids,
which do not show polarization, so the “magnetic ﬁeld strength” is H = B and the “electric displacement” D = E.
The inclusion of susceptible materials is postponed to future work.

C. Gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁeld equations

In this section we recall for completeness the well-known derivation of the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁeld
equations from the ﬁeld Lagrangian Λﬁelds, while the more central problem of the “hydrodynamic” equations of motion
is treated in the next section.

The ﬁeld Lagrangian Λﬁelds has the form

where G is Newton’s gravitational constant, while E and B are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds deﬁned as

in terms of the gauge ﬁelds A0 and A. We see that by this deﬁnition the ﬁrst two Maxwell equations are automatically
satisﬁed, i.e.

Using (8) and (10) it is not diﬃcult to show that requiring invariance of the action (4) under free variations δΦ, δA0

In the case of electromagnetism, however, we face a certain problem of principle:
in the Newtonian framework
the matter theory is expected to be invariant under Galilean transformations, while the theory of electromagnetism
described by Maxwell’s equations is invariant under transformations of the Lorentz group. This well known discrepancy
has of course lead to the development of special relativity, and strictly speaking a coupling between Newtonian physics
and electromagnetism leads to an observer-dependent theory. With this caveat in mind, we can nevertheless proceed,
noting that the inconsistencies will only show up on a level of the order of (v/c)2, where v are typical velocities
involved and c is the speed of light. For non-relativistic velocities and boosts, we therefore have an approximately
Galilean invariant theory, in the sense that deviations will be numerically small.

D. The convective variational principle

In order to derive the equations of motion for the multi-constituent matter system, we cannot apply the standard
variational principle. From (8) we immediately see that allowing free variations of densities δnX and currents δnX
would lead to the trivial equations of motion πX
0 = 0 and πX = 0. The reason for this “failure” of the conventional
variational machinery has already been discussed more extensively in the introduction. To circumvent this problem
we use an approach pioneered by Taub [36] in the relativistic context, which consists of slightly modiﬁed variational
principle without explicit Lagrange constraints. Namely, instead of considering free variations δnX , δnX , we restrict
the ﬂuid variations to those induced by inﬁnitesimal displacements of the ﬂowlines. These convective variations
naturally conserve the number of particles (i.e.
the number of ﬂow-lines) and no further constraints need to be
applied.

We consequently apply inﬁnitesimal spatial displacements ξX and temporal “shifts” τX to the ﬂowlines of the
constituent X . The resulting induced variations of density and current have been derived in Appendix A. For the
induced density variation δnX we combine (A15) and (A29) and obtain

−
while the current variations δnX are found by adding (A20) and (A35), which yields

E. The equations of motion

Up to this point we have developed only purely mathematical identities without a speciﬁc physical content. The
should satisfy under certain

equations of motion are obtained by imposing which type of invariance the action
inﬁnitesimal variations.

I

The most general equations are obtained by requiring that a common displacement and time shift of all constituents,

i.e. ξX = ξ and τX = τ , should result in an action variation of the form

where f ext and gext are interpretable as an “external” force density and energy transfer rate. “External” here is
meant in the sense of not being included in the total Lagrangian, which could also mean, for example, viscous forces.
The resulting “minimal” equations of motion obtained from comparing with (20) are therefore found as

X

The more restrictive class of isolated systems would be characterized by an action that is invariant under these common
displacements and time-shifts, namely f ext = 0 and gext = 0. Together with (21) this represents the “Euler-Lagrange”
equations associated with this variational principle. The actual equations of motion for a given system are only found
once we have speciﬁed the Lagrangian density ΛH, which will be discussed in Sect. V.

If all constituents X form a single ﬂuid, in the sense discussed in Sect. II A, namely all constituents have a common
velocity, then only common displacements of all constituents make sense in the variational principle. For this class
of non–conducting models, (29) represent the full equations of motion obtainable from the variational principle. In
order to complete the model, one has to specify the hydrodynamic Lagrangian ΛH, the “external” interactions f ext
and gext, and the creation rates ΓX as functions of the conﬁguration.

In the case of conducting models, at least some of the constituents are allowed to move independently, the system
therefore consists of more than one ﬂuid. This increases correspondingly the number of degrees of freedom, and more
equations of motion are required. They are obtained very naturally from the variational principle, as now independent
displacements (in space and time) are permitted for each “ﬂuid”. Therefore the resulting force acting on each ﬂuid
can be prescribed by the model, subject to the restriction only of satisfying the “minimal” equations of motion (29).
As an example, consider the case of a simple conducting model consisting of two ﬂuids, where X and Y are indices
running over the respective ﬂuid constituent labels only, i.e. X
. We then have the
ﬂuid 2
Y f Y , which by (29) have
respective force densities acting on each of the two ﬂuids as f (1) =
to satisfy f (1) + f (2) = f ext. Therefore there are now exactly two force densities (e.g. f (1) and f ext) freely speciﬁable
in the model, corresponding to the additional degrees of freedom of two ﬂuids. In this case f (1) could for example
represent a “mutual force” the two ﬂuids exert on each other, i.e. a resistive friction force.

III. “TOTAL” CONSERVATION LAWS

A. Conservation of charge and mass

We see in (26) and (27) that the force contributions

are gauge invariant with respect to the gravitational
and electromagnetic gauge ﬁelds. However, in the expression (24) and (25) for the canonical force and energy rate
we see that the last term, accounting for momentum and energy change due to particle number changes, is generally
gauge dependent. While this is not prohibited for individual constituent forces, the total equations of motion (29)
have to be gauge invariant, and by using (9) we can therefore deduce the constraints

IV. CONSERVATION ALONG INDIVIDUAL FLOWLINES

In addition to the “total” conservation laws for the whole system derived in the previous sections, we can also
ﬁnd conserved quantities for individual constituents, for which conservation holds under transport by the ﬂuid ﬂow.
Because the following derivations apply to each individual constituent instead of the sum over all constituents, we
will omit the constituent index X in this section in order to simplify the notation.

Because transport of a quantity by the ﬂuid ﬂow is closely related to the Lie derivative with respect to the ﬂuid
velocity, these conservation laws are most easily derived using the language and theorems of diﬀerential forms instead
of vectors. Therefore we will use this formalism in deriving the conservation laws, but at the same time we provide
all essential steps and results also in the more common vector and index notation, such that familiarity with exterior
calculus should not be necessary (albeit helpful) for reading this section.

A. Kelvin-Helmholtz vorticity conservation

We deﬁne the “hydrodynamic” vorticity 2-form w (with components wij ) as the exterior derivative (denoted by d)

of the momentum 1-form p (with components pi), namely

where [ij] denotes antisymmetric averaging, i.e. A[iBj] = AiBj

−

i.e. wij

(54)

The volume form is deﬁned as ǫijk = √g [i, j, k], where g = det(gij) and [i, j, k] is the sign of the permutation of
, which is zero if two indices are equal. The vector W is “dual” to the 2-form w in the sense that a further
1, 2, 3
{
duality-operation on W returns to the initial 2-form w, i.e.

}

which is easily veriﬁed by inserting (55). In the presence of electromagnetic ﬁelds, the more important quantity is
the “canonical” vorticity 2-form ̟, which is formed in analogy to (54) with respect to the canonical momentum π,
namely

and the canonical vorticity vector W is naturally deﬁned as

Inserting (9) we see that the relation between canonical and hydrodynamic vorticity is simply

and in terms of the dual vorticity vectors this reads as

We note that by the Poincar´e property (namely dd = 0), the exterior derivatives of the vorticity 2-forms vanish
identically, i.e.

which equivalently expresses the fact that the vorticity vectors are divergence-free, i.e. ∇

W = 0.

which shows that the vorticity is conserved under transport by the ﬂuid, if the proper force per particle acting on the
ﬂuid is purely conservative, i.e. if F = 0. In its more common dual form, this equations can be written as

The Helmholtz vorticity conservation expresses the conservation of angular momentum of ﬂuid particles, and we

1. Vorticity and superﬂuids

The hydrodynamics of charged and uncharged superﬂuids is characterized by two fundamental properties: on one
hand by the absence of dissipative mechanisms like friction or viscosity, and on the other hand by irrotational ﬂow. As
we will see now, the hydrodynamic description of superﬂuids and superconductors is therefore a natural subclass within
the more general framework of multi-constituent hydrodynamics presented here. Let us assume that a constituent
X = S is superﬂuid, with particle density nS, velocity vS, mass mS and charge qS. The absence of microscopic
dissipative mechanisms implies that the superﬂuid is not bound to any other constituents via microscopic particle
collisions, i.e. it is a perfect conductor in the sense that it can ﬂow freely even in the presence of other constituents.
The property of dissipation-less ﬂow can be characterized by the absence of non-conservative forces acting on the
superﬂuid, i.e.

which quite generally characterizes perfect conductors of any sort. As a consequence we see that the vorticity
(and equivalently circulation) of a perfect conductors is strictly conserved, as shown in the previous section. The
second constraint, which distinguishes a superﬂuid from a mere perfect conductor, is that of (locally) irrotational (or
“potential”) ﬂow, which means that the vorticity is zero, i.e.

and equivalently

We see from (68) or (69) that if this superﬂuid constraint is satisﬁed at some instant t, then it will automatically
remain true for all subsequent times due to (75).

The formulation commonly found in the literature on superﬂuids and superconductors is based on the constraint
that the so-called “superﬂuid velocity” is irrotational. If we interpreted this as the actual velocity vS, such a constraint
would generally not be consistent with the equations of motion, contrary to the “natural” conservation (68) of an
irrotational momentum, which is ultimately conserved due to conservation of angular momentum. The “orthodox”
formulation of superﬂuidity, which goes back to Landau’s two-ﬂuid model for 4He is based on a rather unfortunate
misinterpretation of physical quantities, namely the “superﬂuid velocity” turns out to be the rescaled superﬂuid
momentum. The fact that in Newtonian single-ﬂuid contexts the particle momentum only diﬀers by a constant mass
factor from the velocity has unfortunately lead to a less than careful distinction between these fundamentally diﬀerent
quantities. This naive identiﬁcation no longer holds true in more general contexts, like in the case of multi-ﬂuids (like
superﬂuids) or even in the case of relativistic single-ﬂuid hydrodynamics. The velocity circulation is then no longer
conserved, while the conservation of momentum circulation still holds. This point and the “orthodox” formalism of
superﬂuidity will be discussed in more detail in Sect. VI D.

So far we have only constricted the superﬂuid to be dissipation-less and irrotational, but we have to mention a
further important restriction, namely that of the quantization of circulation. While the superﬂuid is constrained to be
locally irrotational (76), it can contain non-zero circulation in the presence of topological defects (such as “vortices”).
As a consequences of (76) we can write the superﬂuid momentum πS as the gradient of a phase ϕ, namely

πS = ~ dϕ ,

i.e. πS = ~ ∇ϕ .

The circulation (70) can therefore be non-zero if ∂Σ encloses a topological defect in ϕ, i.e. a region where ϕ (and πS)
is not deﬁned, as for example in the case of ﬂow inside a torus. While in the case of a perfect irrotational ﬂuid the
resulting circulation could have any value, the superﬂuid phase ϕ is restricted to change only by a multiple N of 2π
when following a closed loop around the defect. The resulting circulation is therefore quantized as

This restriction gives rise to the well-known quantized vortex structure of superﬂuids which we will not discuss further
in the present work.

B. Helicity conservation

Contrary to the conservation laws in the previous sections, which go back to more than a century, there is a further
conserved quantity in hydrodynamics, called helicity, whose existence has only been pointed out comparatively recently

12

(75)

(76)

(77)

(78)

(79)

in hydrodynamics by Moﬀat[28]. This quantity is analogous to the magnetic helicity conservation found in magneto-
hydrodynamics [40], and it is related to the topological structure of the vorticity, i.e.
its “knottedness” [29]. The
relativistic analogue of this conservation has been shown by Carter [5, 7, 9], and generalizations have been discussed
by Bekenstein [4].

We deﬁne the canonical helicity 3-form H (with components Hijk) as the exterior product of the momentum 1-form

π with the vorticity 2-form ̟, i.e.

which in components reads as Hijk = 3π[i̟jk]. A 3-form in a 3-dimensional manifold is dual to a scalar, so we deﬁne
the (canonical) helicity density h as

H

π

̟ ,

≡

∧

Hijk = h ǫijk .

From the duality relation together with the deﬁnitions (80) and (60), we see that the helicity scalar has the following
explicit expression

Using (66) and (68), the comoving time-derivative of H can now be expressed as

V. HYDRODYNAMICS

A. The Lagrangian of hydrodynamics

In the previous section we have derived the most general form of the Euler-Lagrange equations (29) associated with
the convective variational principle, together with the canonical force densities f X (21) and energy transfer rates gX
(22). We are now interested in a particular class of Lagrangian densities ΛH(nX , nX ), namely those which actually
describe Newtonian hydrodynamics. Guided either by the experience from canonical particle mechanics or by looking
at the appropriate Newtonian limit of the generally relativistic description (cf. Appendix D), one can postulate the
general form of the hydrodynamic Lagrangian ΛH to be

where
The kinetic energy density is given by the usual expression

we therefore ﬁnd the following general form of the conjugate momenta pX

0 and pX deﬁned in (3):

We want to be able to identify these conjugate momenta with the actual physical energy and momentum per ﬂuid
V , namely
particle, which implies that under a Galilean boost

these momenta should transform (e.g. see [22]) as

One can verify that under this condition the hydrodynamic force densities
of (26) are also invariant under Galilean
boosts as one should expect. The electromagnetic force in (27) is Galilean invariant only up to corrections of order
(V /c)2, which we will neglect assuming that no “relativistic” speeds are involved. Namely, with the well-known

total charge and total mass are conserved, i.e. if (30) and (31) are satisﬁed. Therefore we see that these conservation

laws follow not only from the requirement of gauge invariance, but also from Galilean invariance.

Therefore the hydrodynamic momentum density is seen to be equal to the total mass current (7) as a consequence of

constituent ﬂuids in the sense that their energy density

Summarising we can therefore write the hydrodynamic Lagrangian density ΛH of (87) for this class of “perfect”
multi-ﬂuid systems as

It is interesting to note that contrary to the relativistic case, which is governed by a fully covariant hydrodynamic
Lagrangian density (cf. Appendix D), the Newtonian Lagrangian (103) is not Galilean invariant because of the
Newtonian expression for the kinetic energy.

The expression (105) for the momenta in terms of the velocities is interesting, as it shows that in general the momenta
are not aligned with the respective ﬂuid velocity, which is the so-called entrainment 3 eﬀect. Only in the absence of
interaction between ﬂuids, such that αXY = 0, or in the case where all constituents move together, i.e. ∆XY = 0,
do we recover the simple single-ﬂuid case for which the momentum is just p = mv. This phenomenon is well-known
(albeit not under the name “entrainment”) in solid-state physics, for example the electron momentum in a crystal
lattice is connected to its velocity by an eﬀective mass-tensor (e.g. see [43]). For a more detailed discussion of the
explicit relation between the solid-state concept of “eﬀective masses” and entrainment in a two-ﬂuid model we refer
the reader to [31]. In the context of superﬂuid mixtures the importance of the interaction and the entrainment eﬀect
have ﬁrst been recognized by Andreev&Bashkin [2], although expressed in the conceptually more confusing “orthodox”
framework of superﬂuidity.

Using (103) together with (106) and (105), we can now write the “generalized pressure” Ψ of (35) in the more useful

form

3 Sometimes also referred to as “drag” in the superﬂuid literature, but as pointed out in [23] this is rather misleading, as entrainment is

a purely conservative, non-dissipative eﬀect, whereas “drag” in physics is usually referring to a dissipative “resistive drag”.

B. Entropy and temperature

As noted earlier in Sect. II A, entropy can be included quite naturally as a constituent, X = s say, in this framework.
The corresponding density and current are ns = s and ns = svs in terms of the entropy density s and its transport
velocity vs. The entropy rest-mass and charge are naturally ms = 0 and qs = 0. The thermodynamically conjugate
variable to the entropy (its “chemical potential”) is the temperature, i.e. µs = T , so we can write (104) as

The “thermal” conjugate momenta ps
(105), namely

0 = Θ0 and ps = Θ for the entropy constituent are found by using (106) and

We see that although the entropy has a zero rest mass, it can acquire a non-zero dynamical momentum Θ due
to entrainment. This can also be interpreted as the entropy “particles” having a non-zero “eﬀective mass”. The

B. Non-barotropic single ﬂuid

The resulting conjugate momenta (105) and (106) are found as

The generalized pressure Ψ of (107) reduces to the usual ﬂuid pressure P , namely

and the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, expressed in its two “dual” formulations (104) and (108), now reads simply

Using these relations, we can express the hydrodynamic force density (109) of the single-constituent perfect ﬂuid as

where ρ is the mass density, i.e. ρ = mn. The requirement of conservations of mass (31) reduces to

b

The perfect ﬂuid in a gravitation ﬁeld Φ with no other external forces acting on it is therefore described by the
equations of motion f = 0 and g = 0, with the canonical force and energy rate given by (109) and (25). We consider
an uncharged ﬂuid, so q = 0 and f =

ρ∇Φ, and so we ﬁnally arrive at the equation of motion:

which is the standard Euler equation as expected. The energy rate g vanishes identically in this case, reﬂecting the
well-known fact that energy conservation is a consequence of momentum conservation in the case of a single perfect
ﬂuid.

Now consider a single ﬂuid consisting of several comoving constituents. This multi–constituent ﬂuid is described
by the densities nX which move with a single velocity vX = v, and so the currents are nX = nX v. Obviously all the
relative velocities vanish in this case, i.e. ∆XY = 0, and therefore there is no entrainment. Here we will explicitly
write the entropy with its density s, and therefore we do not included it in the constituent index set, i.e. X
= s. The
Lagrangian (103) is now

In the context of a single perfect ﬂuid, coupling to electromagnetic ﬁelds does not make much sense, as no charge
conduction is possible (i.e. this requires a two-ﬂuid framework) and so any net charge density j0 has to be frozen into
the ﬂuid, a rather unphysical situation in most practical applications. Therefore we assume a vanishing net charge
density, j0 = 0, and so we can drop the electromagnetic coupling altogether, namely setting all qX = 0 without loss
nX mX ∇Φ. Using (109), the explicit expression for the canonical force densities

The energy equation expresses the heat creation T Γs by chemical reactions ΓX . For an isolated system, where f ext = 0

“Potential vorticity” conservation: Ertel’s theorem

In a special case of the foregoing section we can show a weaker form of the vorticity conservation that survives in
the case of a non-barotropic perfect ﬂuid with a single matter constituent. We consider a system consisting of matter
of density n and mass m and a comoving entropy density s. Mass conservation (31) reduces to Γ = 0 in this case. We

is the “thermal force” (131), namely

We have so far only considered perfect ﬂuids, which are perfect “heat insulators” in the sense that the entropy is
carried along by ﬂuid elements and no heat ﬂows along temperature gradients. It is now straightforward to generalize
to such conducting ﬂuids simply by dropping the assumption that the entropy ﬂux is “bound” to the matter ﬂuid
= v, where vs and v are the velocities of the entropy ﬂuid and the matter ﬂuid
ﬂow, i.e. we just have to allow vs 6
respectively. For simplicity we consider only a single matter constituent, described by its particle number density n,
and which by (31) therefore satisﬁes Γ = 0.

From the general expressions (115) and (114) we see that in general the “entropy ﬂuid” acquires non-zero momentum
due to the interaction with the matter ﬂuid, via entrainment. However, this aspect does not usually seem to be taken
into account in this context (e.g.
see [22]). The aim of the present section is only to show how to recover the
“standard” equations for a heat-conducting ﬂuid, and we therefore simply assume the entrainment to be negligible,
i.e. α = 0. It is certainly an interesting question if this neglect of entrainment is physically justiﬁed in all cases. With
this assumption, the force density (116) and energy rate (117) of the entropy reduce to

f s = s∇T ,

and gs = vs ·

f s + T Γs .

(148)

As in the (isolated) perfect ﬂuid case discussed previously, the equations of motion are again f s + f = 0 and gs + g = 0.
This time, however, one force density, f s say, can be speciﬁed by the model due to the increased number of degrees
of freedom, so we set it to f s = fR, where fR is a resistive force acting against the entropy ﬂow. Therefore we obtain
the Euler equation in the same form as in (136), but now the energy equation takes the form

By the second law of thermodynamics, namely Γs ≥

0, we can constrain the form of the resistive force fR, namely

T Γs = (v

fR .

fR =

≥

i.e. the friction force acting on the entropy ﬂuid is always opposed to its ﬂow relative to the matter ﬂuid. Obviously
the value of the resistivity η is not restricted to be a constant but will generally depend on the state of the system.
Following the traditional description (e.g. [22]) we introduce the heat ﬂux density q relative to the matter ﬂuid as

T s(vs −
By combining this with (148) and (150), we see that the heat ﬂux current is constrained by the second law to be of

where κ is the thermal conductivity. With (151) we can express the velocity of the entropy ﬂuid vs in terms of the

We further ﬁnd for the hydrodynamic energy ﬂux vector QH of (49):

20

(149)

(150)

(152)

(153)

(154)

(155)

(156)

We now consider the example of superﬂuid 4He at a non-zero temperature T . Let n be the number density of 4He
atoms and s be the entropy density. The 4He atoms move with a velocity v, while the entropy (carried by a thermal
gas of excitations such as phonons and rotons) transports heat without friction (i.e. fR = 0) at the velocity vN, so
the relative velocity is ∆ = vN −
v. In this context the “entropy ﬂuid” is often referred to as the “normal ﬂuid” as
opposed to the superﬂuid 4He. The two transport currents, of 4He atoms and of entropy, are respectively

n = n v ,

and s = s vN .

(157)

4 In the absence of entrainment the entropy ﬂuid does not carry momentum, therefore the matter ﬂuid deﬁnes a unique frame in which
the stress tensor (38) is purely isotropic. In this case the generalized pressure Ψ is identical with the usual perfect ﬂuid notion of the
pressure P .

The 4He atoms have mass m, so the mass density is ρ = nm, and the hydrodynamic Lagrangian density (103) reads
as

where the internal energy density

deﬁnes the ﬁrst law (104) in the form,

The conservation of mass (31) implies

Helium is electrically neutral (and non-conducting), so q = 0, and for simplicity we neglect gravity here (as it is
straightforward to include), therefore we have f = 0. Because of the complete absence of direct forces between the
two ﬂuids, the equations of motion in the absence of external forces (i.e. f ext = 0) are simply

The energy equations are g = 0 and gN = gext, and with (117) this leads to

where we have inserted (163). We see that this equation describes the rate of entropy creation by an external heat

The two equations (170) and (172) represent the “canonical” formulation of the two-ﬂuid model for superﬂuid 4He,
however, they do not yet seem to bear any relation to the “orthodox” formulation of Landau’s two-ﬂuid model found
in all textbooks on the subject (e.g. see [20, 22, 37]). Ultimately these equations are equivalent, as we will show now,
nevertheless it is important to note that from the canonical point of view, the “orthodox” formulation is based on a
rather unphysical choice of variables and language, which all derived from the historic deﬁnition of the “superﬂuid
velocity” by Landau.

We now demonstrate the equivalence of these formulations by explicitly translating the canonical formulation into
the “orthodox” language. The starting point of Landau’s model is the statement that the “superﬂuid velocity” is
irrotational. We will denote this so-called “superﬂuid velocity” by V S, which is not to be confused with the velocity
v of 4He atoms, so the starting point is

∇

V S = 0 .

×

From the general discussion about vorticity conservation in Sect. IV A and its particular role in superﬂuids
(Sect. IV A 1) we have already seen that a kinematic constraint like (173) would in general not be conserved by
the ﬂuid motion, and in particular not in the presence of more than one ﬂuid as is the case in superﬂuid 4He at T > 0.
The only possible interpretation we can give V S in order for the constraint (173) to be consistent with hydrodynamics
and to remain true for all times is that it is really the rescaled superﬂuid momentum p, so the “key” to our translation
is the ansatz

V S ≡
While this would be equivalent to the ﬂuid velocity in a single perfect ﬂuid, as seen in (127), in the context of the
present two-ﬂuid model it has no interpretation as the velocity of either the mass or the entropy, as we can see in
(160), therefore we call this a pseudo velocity. It is a dynamic combination of both ﬂuid velocities, which depends on
the interaction α between 4He atoms in the condensate and its excitations. With the explicit entrainment relation
(160), we can now express the velocity v of the 4He ﬂuid in terms of the pseudo-velocity V S and the normal-ﬂuid
velocity vN as

which is equal to the total momentum density J as seen in (101), can be written in the form

v = (1

(175)

which suggests to introduce a “superﬂuid density” ̺S and a “normal density” ̺N as

Nevertheless it is obvious that this split is completely artiﬁcial, and ̺N and ̺S are pseudo densities in the sense
that they do not represent the density of any (conserved) physical quantity and are not even necessarily positive.
In fact neither of the two pseudo-densities and currents are conserved individually, contrary to the real currents
(157). The apparent “mass density” ̺N which the normal ﬂuid acquires is a consequence of the fact that entrainment
provides the entropy ﬂuid with a non-vanishing momentum (162) in the presence of relative motion. Nevertheless the
entropy ﬂuid does not transport any mass, and by ascribing it an artiﬁcial mass density this will be compensated by
a corresponding “counterﬂow” of “superﬂuid density” in cases where there is no net mass current, i.e. in the simple
case where heat ﬂows through a static superﬂuid! This apparently strange behaviour is solely due to an awkward

In order to relate the canonical thermodynamic quantities to the “orthodox” language, we follow Khalatnikov [20]
and Landau [22] and consider the energy density in the “superﬂuid frame” K0, which is deﬁned by V (0)
S = 0. In this
frame, the momentum density J (0) expressed in (178) is

and the transport velocity v of the superﬂuid 4He atoms in this frame can be expressed using (182) as

The hydrodynamic energy density EH of the ﬂuid system is given by (110), which reads in this case

and using the previous translations together with the ﬁrst law (159), we can write the total variation dE(0) of the
energy density in K0 as

which deﬁnes the “superﬂuid chemical potential”

E. A two-ﬂuid model for the neutron star core

Here we consider a (simpliﬁed) model for the matter inside a neutron star core, which mainly consists of a (charge
neutral) plasma of neutrons ( 90%), protons and electrons. We focus on superﬂuid models in which the neutrons are
assumed to be superﬂuid, which allows them to freely traverse the ﬂuid of charged components due to the absence of
viscosity. As discussed in Sect. IV A 1, this also implies some extra complications due to the quantization of vorticity
into microscopic vortices. Here we are interested in a “macroscopic” description, i.e. we consider ﬂuid elements that
are small compared to the dimensions of the total system, but which contain a large number of vortices. On this
scale we can work with a smooth averaged vorticity instead of having to worry about individual vortices. One eﬀect
of the presence of the vortices will be a slight anisotropy in the resulting smooth averaged ﬂuid [3, 11, 12], which can
be ascribed to the tension of vortices, and which we will neglect here for simplicity. The second eﬀect of the vortex
lattice is that it allows a direct force between the superﬂuid and the normal ﬂuid, mediated by the respective vortex
interactions, and which is naturally described in the context of the two-ﬂuid model as a “mutual force”. The model
assumptions used here are fairly common to most current studies of superﬂuid neutrons stars (e.g. see [1, 25, 27, 31]).
, corresponding to the electrons, protons and
}
entropy, and we will label this ﬂuid with ’c’. The second ﬂuid consists only of the superﬂuid neutrons, i.e. X = n.
This model could also be applied in the crust if one neglects the anisotropic stresses due to solidity, the only diﬀerence
would be that instead of free protons we have positively charged nucleons as a constituent of the normal ﬂuid. Charge
conservation (30) implies

The model therefore consists of comoving constituents X

e, p, s

∈ {

and for simplicity we will assume local charge neutrality, i.e.

As neutrons and protons are assumed to be strictly moving together in this model, we can neglect electromagnetic
interactions altogether and set qe = qp = 0 without loss of generality. Another physical constraint is baryon conser-
vation, i.e. we must have

Γe = Γp ,

ne = np .

Γn + Γp = 0 ,

and together with mass conservation (31), this leads to the requirement5

≡
We can therefore write the mass densities (7) of the two ﬂuids as

mn = mp + me

m .

ρn = m nn ,

and ρc = m np .

The ﬁrst law (104) of this model reads as

Obviously there is only one independent relative velocity ∆, namely

conserved separately from energy.

With (24) together with (190) and (192) we can write the canonical force densities more explicitly as

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side is the work done by the mutual force, and the second term is the entropy created

where the last term gives the correction to the chemical equilibrium due to relative motion ∆ of the two ﬂuids. The
second law of thermodynamics for an isolated system states that entropy can only increase, i.e. Γs ≥

this to be identically true in (207), the mutual force f mut and the reaction rate Γn have to be of the form

F. Electric conductors

Now let us move to systems that are coupled to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, so consider a simple electric conductor
describable as a two-constituent system. One constituent consists of the positively charged ions, described by their
number density n, velocity v, mass per ion m and charge per ion q = Ze. The second constituent is a gas of electrons
of density ne, velocity ve, mass me and charge qe =
e. Charge density and current (6) are therefore expressible as

Charge transfer between the two ﬂuids is possible in principle, e.g. we could allow for processes of ionization and
recombination, where electrons are transferred from the ion-ﬂuid to the ﬂuid of free electrons. But for simplicity we
will assume the number of free electrons to be conserved, so we have

The total diﬀerential of the energy function

(n, ne, ∆2) is

These equations contain the usual magneto-hydrodynamic equations and the “ﬂuid” description of plasma physics (e.g.
see [13, 17]) as special cases, however they are even more general in the sense of including the eﬀect of entrainment,
which usually seems to be left out in these contexts. The total pressure diﬀerential (108) reads as

dΨ = n dµ + ne dµe

α d∆2 .

−

We note that in general we can not introduce “partial pressures”, e.g. by deﬁning dPe to be equal nedµe, as this
is in general not a total diﬀerential, due to interaction energies between the constituents. Contrary to the “partial
pressures”, the chemical potentials are always well-deﬁned and are much more natural quantities in general multi-ﬂuid
contexts.

The total momentum equation is

where we assumed the system to be isolated, i.e. f ext = 0. In addition, the model can prescribe a mutual force density
b
between the ﬂuids, so we set the “resistivity force” f e = fR, and so f =
fR. The energy equation (29) with (25)
therefore now takes the form

−

b

Such a resistive force will lead to creation of heat (entropy), which in this case has to be extracted by an “external”
system via gext as we have not included entropy in the present description. Nevertheless we can argue that by the
second law the friction should produce heat and not absorb it, so we have to extract heat-energy from the system,
i.e. gext < 0, which leads to the constraint

where η is obviously not restricted to be a constant.

In the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit we can assume any net charge densities to be compensated very quickly

by the motion of electrons, so we make the “quasi-neutral” approximation and set:

which by (217) implies Zn = ne and the current density therefore reads as

In this low frequency limit we can equally neglect the displacement current ∂tE in Maxwell’s equations (14).

Because the electrons a very light, i.e. me ≪

and so the equation of motion for the electrons, f e = fR, can be written with (223), (225) and (229) as

In contrast to the previous application, superconductors are perfect conductors, so the electrons can ﬂow past the

the inertial and pressure forces of the electrons a-priori. As mentioned previously (cf. Sect. IV A 1), in addition to
the absence of friction, superﬂuids are constrained to be irrotational, so

(243) remains automatically satisﬁed under the evolution of the electron ﬂuid.

The two equations (243) and (244) were originally proposed (albeit in the “orthodox formulation”) by F. and
H. London [16] and have been very successful in describing the phenomenology of superconductors, and in particular
their behaviour in electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

APPENDIX A: EVALUATION OF CONVECTIVE VARIATIONS

We write the particle ﬂowlines as

xi = xi(a, t) ,

ai = xi(a, 0) .

where the “particle coordinates” ai are used to label individual particles and can be taken, for example, to be their
initial position, i.e.

We consider the variations of ﬂuid variables induced by active inﬁnitesimal spatial displacements ξi(x, t) and temporal
shifts τ (x, t) of the ﬂuid particle ﬂowlines (A1), namely

xi′

(a, t′) = xi(a, t) + ξi(x, t) ,

and t′ = t + τ (x, t) .

We note that the transformation (A3) not only shifts ﬂowlines in space, but also introduce new time-slices t′ = const,
which are generally “curved” because the time-shift τ (x, t) can be a varying function in space. A physical quantity
of the ﬂow, Q(x, t) say, is changed to Q′(x′, t′), and we deﬁne the corresponding Eulerian and Lagrangian variations
in the usual way as

Now consider an active inﬁnitesimal transformation of the diﬀerentials dxi of the form

We ﬁrst consider the changes induced by a purely spatial (active) displacement ξi, i.e.

xi′
which transforms the diﬀerentials dxi as

(a, t) = xi(a, t) + ξi(x, t) ,

and t′ = t ,

This is of the form (A9) with M i

l =

(a, t) = dxi(a, t) + (

of particles, and so the Lagrangian change ∆N of the number of particles in this volume is zero. This implies that
the corresponding Lagrangian change of the particle number density n

2. Time shifts τ

Now consider a pure time-shift τ of the ﬂowlines, for which (A3) reduces to

xi′

(a, t′) = xi(a, t) , with t′ = t + τ (x, t) ,

so t′ is now a function of position as well as of the initial instant t. We want to relate the spatial diﬀerential dxi
the time-slice t to the transformed spatial diﬀerential dxi
total diﬀerentials

t′ on the on the new time-slice t′. From (A21) we ﬁnd the

APPENDIX B: SYMMETRY OF T ij
H

where the partial time derivatives are at constant x.

In order to show that the hydrodynamic stress tensor T ij

H introduced in (38) is symmetric, we consider the transfor-
mation properties of the hydrodynamic Lagrangian ΛH under a coordinate transformation xi′
= xi + ζi. Contrary to
the active displacements considered in the derivation of the convective variations (cf. previous section), a coordinate
transformation also induces a change in the metric components gij, namely

APPENDIX C: GALILEAN INVARIANCE OF E

In this section we show that requiring the conjugate momenta pX

0 and pX of (89) to transform as (91) and (92)

under Galilean boosts (90) implies that the internal energy

has to be Galilean invariant.

We assume that

(nX , nX ) transforms into

APPENDIX D: NEWTONIAN LIMIT OF THE RELATIVISTIC LAGRANGIAN

As shown in the relativistically covariant framework by Carter [7], the equations of motion for conducting multi-

constituent ﬂuids can be derived from a covariant Lagrangian density of the form

where ρ is the scalar mass-energy density of the system. For simplicity we consider here a two-ﬂuid system, as
generalizations to more ﬂuids are straightforward while making the notation more cumbersome. The two ﬂuids, A
and B say, are described by the two 4-current densities nµ
A, nµ
B) can only depend
on the three independent scalar combinations of these two currents, for example

B, and therefore the scalar Λcov(nµ

We are interested here only in the purely hydrodynamic content of this framework, so we assume a ﬂat space-time,
i.e. a metric of the form

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν =

c2 dt2 + dx2 ,

−

with the time-coordinate x0 = t and so g00 =
, the metric becomes
singular. The reason for this singular limit obviously lies in the fact that a locally Lorentzian theory reduces to a
Galilean invariant theory, therefore the Lorentz invariance has to be broken in the limit. As the non-invertible metric
no longer fully determines the space-time, we now have to choose 6 a preferred time coordinate, t say, in which to take
the limit and which will reduce to the Newtonian “absolute time”.

(c0). We see that this Lagrangian obviously diverges in the Newtonian limit c

where the ﬁrst term represents the rest-mass energy, while
interaction energy at order

due to the rest-mass energy. Before we can take this limit, we therefore have to renormalize the Lagrangian density
by subtracting a ﬁnite counter-term that will make the limit ﬁnite. Apart from subtracting the whole ﬁrst term,
which would leave us just with the “internal” energy
, the most natural choice is to subtract the mass-energy in
the preferred-time frame that will determine the Newtonian absolute time. We therefore deﬁne the renormalized
Lagrangian density Λren as

contains the “equation of state”, namely pressure and

In Λren we have explicitly broken Lorentz invariance by choosing a preferred time frame, and with (D6) we express

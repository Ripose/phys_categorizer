We investigate the asymptotic properties of inertial modes conﬁned in a spherical shell
when viscosity tends to zero. We ﬁrst consider the mapping made by the characteristics
of the hyperbolic equation (Poincar´e’s equation) satisﬁed by inviscid solutions. Charac-
teristics are straight lines in a meridional section of the shell, and the mapping shows
that, generically, these lines converge towards a periodic orbit which acts like an attrac-
tor (the associated Lyapunov exponent is always negative or zero). We show that these
attractors exist in bands of frequencies the size of which decreases with the number of
reﬂection points of the attractor. At the bounding frequencies the associated Lyapunov
exponent is generically either zero or minus inﬁnity. We further show that for a given
frequency the number of coexisting attractors is ﬁnite.

We then examine the relation between this characteristic path and eigensolutions of
the inviscid problem and show that in a purely two-dimensional problem, convergence
towards an attractor means that the associated velocity ﬁeld is not square-integrable. We
give arguments which generalize this result to three dimensions. Then, using a sphere
immersed in a ﬂuid ﬁlling the whole space, we study the critical latitude singularity and
show that the velocity ﬁeld diverges as 1/√d, d being the distance to the characteristic
grazing the inner sphere.

We then consider the viscous problem and show how viscosity transforms singularities
into internal shear layers which in general betray an attractor expected at the eigenfre-
quency of the mode. Investigating the structure of these shear layers, we ﬁnd that they
are nested layers, the thinnest and most internal layer scaling with E1/3-scale, E being
the Ekman number; for this latter layer, we give its analytical form and show its simi-
larity to vertical 1
3 -shear layers of steady ﬂows. Using an inertial wave packet traveling
around an attractor, we give a lower bound on the thickness of shear layers and show
how eigenfrequencies can be computed in principle. Finally, we show that as viscosity
decreases, eigenfrequencies tend towards a set of values which is not dense in [0, 2Ω],
contrary to the case of the full sphere (Ω is the angular velocity of the system).

Hence, our geometrical approach opens the possibility of describing the eigenmodes
and eigenvalues for astrophysical/geophysical Ekman numbers (10−10 − 10−20), which
are out of reach numerically, and this for a wide class of containers.

1. Introduction

Inertial waves, which propagate in rotating ﬂuids thanks to the restoring action of the
Coriolis force, can generate very singular ﬂuid ﬂows when they are conﬁned in a closed
container. These very special properties of inertial modes were ﬁrst noticed in the theo-
retical work of K. Stewartson and others (Stewartson & Rickard 1969; Stewartson 1971,
1972a,b; Walton 1975; London & Shen 1979). They appeared again recently in numerical
investigations by Hollerbach & Kerswell (1995), Rieutord (1995), Rieutord & Valdettaro
(1997), Fotheringham & Hollerbach (1998) and show an even greater generality since
they are also present in stratiﬁed ﬂuids (Maas & Lam 1995; Rieutord & Noui 1999) or
rotating stratiﬁed ﬂuids (Dintrans et al. 1999).

The particularity of all these waves (inertial, gravity, gravito-inertial) is that their
associated modes are solutions of an ill-posed boundary-value problem when they are
conﬁned in a close container: the partial diﬀerential equation is of hyperbolic or mixed
type in the spatial variables. This yields all kinds of singularities. When viscosity is
included, these singularities are regularized but they still play a central role in featuring
the shape of inertial modes of a rotating spherical shell; in particular, they control the
asymptotic limit of small diﬀusivities which is the relevant limit for astrophysical or
geophysical applications.

The aim of this paper is to present what we believe to be the asymptotic limit of
inertial modes in a spherical shell when viscosity tends to zero. In the ﬁrst part of the
paper we shall present the main features of the solutions of this problem when viscosity
is omitted. For this purpose we examine the trajectories of characteristics in a meridional
plane of the shell as if they were trajectories of a dynamical system in some conﬁguration
space. We then focus on the relation between these trajectories and the eigenfunctions
in two and three dimensions. We end this part with a close look at the critical latitude
singularity. In the second part we investigate the changes brought on by viscosity and
we examine more closely the structure of shear layers which arise. Then, by studying the
behaviour of a wave-packet, we show how eigenvalues and eigenmodes may be computed
in the asymptotic limit of a small viscosity. We conclude this part by a brief discussion of
the distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane. The paper ends with a discussion of
the more general cases including containers with a diﬀerent shape and of the applications
of the present theoretical results.

As this paper is rather long and goes through some mathematical developments which
may be skipped at ﬁrst reading, we suggest the casual reader to skip subsections §2.2.1-
5, 2.3.1-2 and 2.4.1-2 and be lead by the introductions of sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 and
then jump to 2.5 and 2.6. The second part is not so mathematical but the details of the
boundary layer analysis (§3.2.2-4) can be skipped at ﬁrst reading.

2. Some properties of inviscid solutions

2.1. Equations of motion

We consider a ﬂuid with no viscosity contained in a spherical shell whose outer radius is R
and inner radius ηR with η < 1. The ﬂuid is rotating around the z-axis with the angular
velocity Ω. Using (2Ω)−1 as the time scale and R as the length scale, small amplitude
perturbations obey the linear equation

∂t + ~ez × ~u = −~∇p
~∇ · ~u = 0

where ~u is the velocity ﬁeld of the perturbations and p is the reduced pressure perturba-
tion. The boundary conditions are simply

at

r = η

~u · ~er = 0

(2.2)
As in Rieutord & Valdettaro (1997) and Dintrans, Rieutord & Valdettaro (1999) we shall
use spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ) or cylindrical coordinates (s, ϕ, z). ~eq will denote the
unit vector associated with the coordinate q ∈ {r, θ, ϕ, s, z}.
tions (2.1) may be cast into a single equation for the pressure, namely

(2.3)

which has been referred to as Poincar´e equation since the work of Cartan (1922). This
equation is completed by the boundary condition ~u · ~er = 0 which reads
− ω2~er · ~∇p + iω(~ez × ~er) · ~∇p + (~ez · ~er)(~ez · ~∇p) = 0

(2.4)

when expressed with the pressure; it applies at r = η and r = 1.

As is well-known (Greenspan 1969), the Poincar´e equation is hyperbolic since for all
modes ω < 1. Therefore, a ﬁrst step in the analysis of this equation is the determination
of the characteristics surfaces; for this purpose, we note that second-order derivatives of
this equation read

∂2p
∂x2 +

∂2p
∂y2 −

α2
ω2

∂2p
∂z2

where α2 = 1 − ω2. x and y are the cartesian coordinates in a plane z = 0. These
second-order derivatives deﬁne characteristics surfaces such as z − f (x, y) = 0 where f
veriﬁes :

∂x(cid:19)2
(cid:18) ∂f

∂y(cid:19)2
+(cid:18) ∂f

=

α2
ω2 .

(2.5)

These surfaces are known as ‘surfaces of constant slope’ as any tangent plane makes the
same angle ϑ = π
2 − arcsin ω with the equatorial plane z = 0. In fact, these surfaces may
be generated by a family of such planes or by cones which aperture angle is

λ = arcsin ω

(2.6)

which is also the critical latitude in a sphere. In a meridional plane, the trace of these
surfaces are simply straight lines making the angle λ with the rotation axis.

A second step in the analysis of the Poincar´e equation is to examine the separability of
the variables. Because of the symmetry of the problem with respect to rotations around
the z-axis, the ϕ variable may always be separated from the two others. This implies
that solutions may always be expressed as

and that each Fourier component pm(r, θ) is independent of the others.

pm(r, θ)eimϕ

The two other coordinates, however, are not separable in the general case. This point
may be understood easily if we recall that through a linear transformation of the z-
coordinate, the Poincar´e equation may be transformed into the Laplace equation as ﬁrst

shown by Bryan (1889) (see also Greenspan 1969). In this transformation the boundaries
transform into one-sheet hyperboloids. One therefore adopts an ellipsoidal coordinate
system within which one of the boundaries is a surface of coordinate; unfortunately,
since the two bounding hyperboloids are not confocal, coordinates can be only separated
on one of the boundaries of the spherical shell. Hence, one may simplify, and actually
solve, the problem either in the full sphere (see Greenspan 1969) or in the inﬁnite ﬂuid
outside a sphere (see below).

We have now seen the basic ingredients which make this problem diﬃcult: hyperbolicity

(ill-posedness) and non-separability.

2.2. Orbits of characteristics

As shown by the foregoing discussion the diﬃculty of the problem lies in the behaviour
of the solutions with respect to the coordinates in a meridional plane (s, z) or (r, θ). We
shall therefore restrict our analysis to this plane where characteristic surfaces are simply
straight lines; thanks to the exp(imϕ)-dependence, our results will apply equally to ax-
isymmetric or non-axisymmetric modes. Indeed, using the separation of the ϕ-variable,
we eliminate second-order derivatives in ϕ and characteristic surfaces are just cones in-
dependent of m. We shall therefore study, in the following subsections, the trajectories
of characteristics in a meridional plane as we did in Dintrans et al. (1999). Since this is
a rather technical matter, the reader may ﬁrst skip it and directly jump to section 2.3
where the results are summarized.

2.2.1. The mapping

From (2.5) we derive the well-known equations of the two families of characteristics:

(2.7)
where u± will designate the characteristics coordinates. u+ and u− are constant along
characteristics of positive and negative slopes, respectively.

ωz ± αs = u∓

To describe the paths followed by characteristics, we ﬁrst study the map which relates

due to the periodicity in the [0,4π] interval are not counted.

the position of the n+1th reﬂection point to the one of the nth both taken on the outer
sphere. For this purpose we mark out these points by an angle φ ∈ [0, 2π] which is
identical to the latitude when 0 ≤ φ ≤ π/2; this is indeed more convenient than the
colatitude. If one reﬂection is needed on the inner sphere then we have

sin(φn+1 − δn+1) = η sin(β − δn+1) (cid:27)
sin(φn − δn) = η sin(β − δn)

(2.8)

where β is the position of the reﬂection point on the inner shell and δn = ±π/2 ± λ is
the direction of the characteristic which can take four values as illustrated in ﬁgure 1a.
If the two reﬂection points are simply connected by one segment of characteristics then
the recurrence relation is either

when the characteristic has a positive slope, or

φm + φm+1 = −2λ [2π]

φm + φm+1 = 2λ [2π]

(2.9)

(2.10)

when the characteristic has a negative slope. These notations are summarized in ﬁgure 1b.

From the expression (2.8), (2.9) and (2.10) one can compute the map

φn+1 =(cid:26) f+(φn)

f−(φn)

Such a map is bi-valued since one may compute the image by ﬁrst applying a positive-
(f+) or a negative- (f−) slope characteristic. However, such a representation is not con-
venient for iterating the map since for each iteration one has to decide whether to use
f+ or f−. We therefore constructed a single-valued map which is deﬁned in the following
way: Considering a point of the outer sphere, we mark it out by the angle φ ∈ [0, 2π] if
it is to be iterated by f− or by the same angle plus 2π if it is to be iterated by f+. We
thus deﬁne the map:

mode with ω = 0.40782 for a shell of aspect ratio η = 0.35: note the appearance of ﬁxed points
marked out by the intersection of the curve with the line φn+p = φn. They indicate the existence
of attractive periodic orbits of period 3 and 8 respectively. Note also the increased number of
discontinuities of the mapping.

f : [0, 4π] −→ [0, 4π]

φn −→ f (φn) = φn+1

(2.11)

which is one-to-one except at some points of discontinuity and which can be easily iter-
ated. An example of this map is given in ﬁgure 2.

One of the remarkable features of this map is that it is not continuous. The disconti-

nuities occur at the colatitudes (in the ﬁrst quadrant)

θ± = λ ± arcsin η,

θs = λ + arcsin(η cos 2λ)

θ± are delineating the ‘shadow’ projection of the inner shell on the outer shell (see
ﬁgure 5 for an illustration of the shadow). They illustrate the case when a characteristic
is tangent to the inner sphere at critical latitude. θs is the colatitude of the projection
of the inner sphere’s critical latitude on the outer sphere. These angles (θ±) delimit the
intervals where the map is contracting |f ′| < 1 or dilating |f ′| > 1 or neutral |f ′| = 1.
When the map (2.11) is iterated as in ﬁgure 3 and since, generically, discontinuities
are not mapped onto themselves†, their number increases proportionally to the number
of iterations; also some ﬁxed points appear which indicate the existence of attractors, i.e.
attractive periodic orbits which we discuss below (§2.2.4). We would therefore expect that
the basins of attraction of the inﬁnitely iterated map, containing an inﬁnite number of
intervals at smaller and smaller scales, would have a fractal structure; however, numerical
studies show only isolated accumulation points which are actually the ﬁxed repulsive
points of the mapping, i.e. the repellors (see ﬁgure 4).

We therefore see that the structure of basins of attraction is much more complicated
than in the case studied by Maas & Lam (1995) and may represent the general case for
such systems.

† The case when all discontinuities are mapped onto themselves corresponds to periodic orbits

of the shadow (see §2.2.3).

aspect ratio η and the frequency ω are the same as in ﬁgure 3. On the left panel we clearly see
the presence of the accumulation point φR; the two arrows indicate the basins of attraction of
the polar attractor in ﬁgure 7a; the other segments belong to the basin of the other (equatorial)
attractor. On the right panel we see that the width of the intervals of the basins of attraction
vanishes geometrically as the accumulation point is approached.

2.2.2. Orbits and Lyapunov exponents: the full sphere case

Once the mapping is known, we may examine the trajectories of characteristics. For
the sake of clarity, it is useful to ﬁrst consider the case of the full sphere for which only
(2.9) and (2.10) are necessary.

We ﬁrst note that the number of reﬂection points of a periodic orbit is necessarily
even, i.e. 2q, when the starting point is not a critical latitude. Applying alternatively
(2.9) and (2.10), we have

...

(2.12)

...

φ1 = −φ2 + 2λ [2π]
−φ2 = φ3 + 2λ [2π]
...
φ2q−1 = −φ2q + 2λ [2π]
−φ2q = φ1 + 2λ [2π]




Summing all these equations leads to the conclusion that a periodic orbit is such that

λ =

pπ
2q

(2.13)

where p and 2q are integers which represent the number of crossings of the orbit with
respectively the axis of rotation or the equator.

From the preceding results, it turns out that all orbits such that λ = rπ with r irra-
tional, are ergodic (quasi-periodic). At this point it is worth noting that eigenfrequencies
of inertial modes in the full sphere are in general associated with quasi-periodic orbits. We
prove in appendix A that, for instance, the ﬁrst axisymmetric inertial mode of frequency

p3/7 is associated with a quasi-periodic orbit.

To conclude with the full sphere, we just need to point out that thanks to relations
(2.9) or (2.10), it is clear that the Lyapunov exponent is always zero. Indeed, if we recall
the deﬁnition of the Lyapunov exponent Λ associated with an orbit:

dφn (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= 1 ∀n, so Λ = 0.

2.2.3. Orbits and Lyapunov exponents: the shell case

We now turn to the shell case. As we already observed the map has discontinuities
deﬁned by the shadow of the inner sphere on the outer shell and the projection of critical
latitudes. If the inner sphere is suﬃciently small, the shadow may draw a periodic pattern
if the critical latitude λ is commensurable with π. A simple case is illustrated in ﬁgure 5.
For these frequencies, orbits starting in the shadow remain in the shadow while those
starting outside remain outside. In this way, one can construct the set of all periodic
orbits with Λ = 0 i.e. all neutral periodic orbits.

The fact that periodic orbits outside the shadow are neutral is obvious; the case of
orbits in the shadow is less obvious but we may consider the fact that if these orbits
were not neutral, the shadow would not map onto itself. As a short exercise, we may
follow one such orbit for ω = sin(π/2(2p + 1)). The shadow should cross only twice the
location of the inner sphere. It bounces ﬁrst on the inner sphere, at an angle β1, and
then on the outer sphere at the angle φ1 given by sin(φ1 − δ) = η sin(β1 − δ) (δ is one
of the angles δn in ﬁgure 1). Then it bounces 2p times on the outer sphere. After each
two reﬂections, the angle φ changes into φ + 4δ. Therefore after 2p bounces, the angle
on the outer sphere is φ1 + 4pδ. It bounces then again on the inner sphere, hitting it at
the angle β2 such that sin(φ1 + δ + 4pδ) = η sin(β2 + δ). But 2(2p + 1)δ = π therefore
δ+4pδ = π−δ[2π]. So sin(φ1−δ) = −η sin(β2+δ) = η sin(β1−δ). Therefore β1 = −β2[2π]
or β1 = π + β2 + 2δ[2π]. Repeating this entire process 2(2p + 1) times, one comes back
to the original β1.

In fact periodic orbits of the shadow do not exist for all λ’s commensurable with π.
Indeed the image of the shadow must not be split by discontinuities; this implies that
p or q cannot be too large or the shell too thin. More precisely, for a given η, periodic
orbits of the shadow exist if:

If η ≥ 1/√2, only one neutral periodic orbit exists: it is such that λ = π/4 or ω = 1/√2.

arcsin η ≤ λ ≤ arccos η

Figure 6. The lyapunov exponent of one basin as a function of frequency (left) or critical
latitude (right). Note the symmetry of this last plot with respect to π/4. The vertical dotted
lines mark the critical latitudes π/6, π/4 and π/3; the aspect ratio of the shell is η = 0.35.

More generally, for a given aspect ratio η, one may determine all the frequencies associ-
ated with neutral periodic orbits and their number increases as the size of the inner shell
decreases. These frequencies are obviously determined by (2.13) but due to the ﬁnite size
of the shadow, one needs to eliminate large values of p and q. If we remark that the most
robust periodic orbits (when η increases) are those with p = 1 (restricting ourselves to
λ ≤ π/4), relation (2.14) easily bounds the permitted values of q. For a shell like the core
of the Earth, where η = 0.35, only q = 2, 3, 4 are possible.
The frequencies of neutral periodic orbits are important as they shape the form of the
Lyapunov exponent curve since, then, intervals contracting through f+ are exactly dilated
by f− which makes the Lyapunov exponent vanish. As a consequence, frequencies in the
neighbourhood of one such frequency are associated with very long orbits having a small
Lyapunov exponent. This is the reason why ‘windows’ appear near these frequencies,
especially near ω = 1/√2 (λ = π/4) as clearly shown in ﬁgure 6.

This latter ﬁgure shows many spikes which in fact betray the presence of other periodic
orbits which we shall call attractors after Maas & Lam (1995). For such orbits Λ ≤ 0.
In fact for this system, all the orbits (except may be some isolated ones) verify this
inequality and no chaos is possible: the conﬁguration space being one-dimensional and
the mapping being one-to-one.

2.2.4. Some properties of attractors in the shell

In order to make the dynamics of attractors clearer, it is useful to concentrate on a
speciﬁc example which can be computed explicitly. For this purpose, we choose a spherical
shell similar to that of the core of the Earth for which η = 0.35 and we focus on the
orbit with four reﬂections on the outer or inner shell as shown in ﬁgure 7. If the shell is
thinner, this orbit is localized in the vicinity of the equator which is the kind studied by
Stewartson (1971, 1972a,b).

The Lyapunov exponent of this orbit may be computed explicitly in the following way:
Let us ﬁrst recall that plane inertial waves reﬂecting on a surface oriented by ~n veriﬁes
the relation

10

Figure 7. (a) Two attractors coexisting when ω = 0.4051; we call them ‘polar’ and ‘equatorial’
respectively as they are characterized by the fact that the reﬂection on the inner sphere occurs
above or below the critical latitude; the arrows indicate the direction of focusing. (b) Lyapunov
exponent as a function of frequency in the vicinity of ω = 0.4051; the thick solid line denotes the
equatorial attractor while the thick dashed line represents the polar attractor; these two thick
lines have been derived from the analytic formulae (B 4) and (B 8) given in appendix B.

where ~ki and ~kr are the wave vectors of the incident and reﬂected waves respectively
(Greenspan 1969). When applied to a reﬂection on a sphere, this relation implies

~ki × ~n = ~kr × ~n

kr = ki

sin(φ ± λ)
sin(φ ∓ λ)

where φ is the ‘latitude’ of the reﬂection point. From this relation, we can compute the
rate of contraction of an inﬁnitesimal interval in the neighbourhood of a reﬂection point
of the orbit. Therefore, the Lyapunov exponent of an attractor with N reﬂection points
is simply given by:

Λ = −

1
N

ln

N

Yk=1

sin(φk ± λ)
sin(φk ∓ λ)

(2.15)

where the φk’s describe the reﬂection points of the attractor (a periodic orbit). At this
point we shall deﬁne two useful quantities characterizing attractors, namely their length
and their period. We shall call the number of reﬂection points (on both spheres) the
length of the attractor while its period will refer to the minimum number of iteration of
the mapping needed to generate its associated ﬁxed points; because of the deﬁnition of
the mapping, the period is also the number of reﬂection points on the outer sphere. For
instance, the period of the equatorial attractor of ﬁgure 7a is ’3’ and its length is ’4’,
while for the polar one, the length is ’10’ and the period ’8’ (we do not allow reﬂections
on the axis). We give in appendix B the explicit calculations relevant to the orbits of
ﬁgure 7.

The curves Λ(ω) (ﬁgure 7b) show the same feature: in the interval of existence of the

Inertial waves in a rotating spherical shell: attractors and asymptotic spectrum 11
orbit, Λ varies between 0 and −∞. The two extremes correspond respectively to the cases
when the reﬂection on the inner shell occurs at the equator or at its critical latitude. We
note that the vanishing value of the Lyapunov exponent does not mean that for this
frequency the orbit is no longer an attractor: it simply means that convergence towards
the attractor is no longer exponential; in most cases, it does converge, but algebraically.
For later use, we also computed the behaviour of Λ(ω) in the vicinity of the point ω0

such that Λ(ω0) = 0. We ﬁnd in the particular case of the equatorial attractor that

Λ(ω) = −K(ω − ω0)1/2,

with K = 4.8184, ω0 = 0.403112887

(2.16)

In fact this behaviour is general as is shown in appendix B. Let us also emphasize that
when Λ = 0, the orbit is just one broken line connecting:

• the equator or the pole of the spheres to another equator or pole,
• the equator or the pole of the spheres to the critical latitudes of the outer sphere.
With the terminology in use for dynamical systems, such an orbit restricted to the ﬁrst
quadrant is self-retracing: a mass-point would go back and forth on the same trajectory.
The foregoing results make the shape of ﬁgure 6 quite clear now. Most of the ‘spikes’
shown in this graph will therefore tend to −∞ as the number of points of the graph is
increased. But to be complete, we need also mention some cases when a segment of an
orbit intercepts the inner shell after being tangential to it. In this case the curve Λ(ω)
has a discontinuity and does not reach −∞.
We therefore see that attractors are featuring ﬁgure 6. As it will be clear later they
also feature the shape of the asymptotic spectrum. It is thus interesting to know some
elementary properties of these geometrical objects.

From a rather large number of computations we observed, as Maas & Lam (1995), that,
in the ﬁrst quadrant, not more than two attractors may coexist for a single frequency.
However, these two attractors can be used to construct other attractors which are just
their image symmetrized with respect to axis of rotation and equator. Considering the
propagation of characteristics in the full meridional section of the shell, we observe that
these lines can converge towards six attractors at most. Using the properties of the
mapping (2.11), we have been able to prove under certain hypotheses (see appendix C),
that the number of attractors is bounded by the number of points of discontinuity (which
is twelve).

We also computed the interval of existence, in frequency space, of a large number
of attractors so as to show its relation with the length of the attractor. As shown in
ﬁgure 8, the interval of existence is well correlated with the inverse square of the length.
We explain this law in the following way: for a very long attractor of length N ≫ 1
the number of reﬂections on the inner and outer shell scales with N , therefore the mean
angular distance between the critical latitude and the nearest reﬂection point is O(1/N ).
This implies that just a O(1/N 2) variation in frequency is necessary to shift this point
to the critical latitude.
The latter result has an interesting consequence on the shape of the curve Λ(ω) for a
given long attractor. Indeed, from (2.15) the divergence toward −∞ of an attractor of
length N is of the form:

Λ ∼

1
N

ln [N (ω − ωc)]

where ωc is the frequency of the singularity of Λ; we used the fact that (2.15) is dominated
by one term ( φk − λ ∼ 0 with φk − λ ∼ N (ω − ωc) ); since the interval of existence of the
attractor scales like 1/N 2, if we choose a point such that ω − ωc = α/N 2 the Lyapunov

exponent will scale like Λ ∼ − ln(αN )
which vanishes at large N . This means that the
singularity of the Lypaunov curve occupies a smaller and smaller fraction of the interval
of existence of the attractor. Hence for long attractors, the Lyapunov exponent is very
small in a larger and larger part of their interval of existence. This explains why long
attractors appear numerically as weakly attracting eventhough their Lyapunov exponent
may diverge.

N

In ﬁgure 9 we show the distance of attractors to the point on the external sphere at
critical latitude as a function of the length. Since a periodic orbit exists in a range of
frequencies (see ﬁgure 8), instead of showing a single point we represent a vertical segment
connecting the minimum and maximum distance over the entire range of existence of the
attractor in frequency space. We see that the maximum distance is well correlated with
the inverse square of the length. This distance is important in the ﬁnal appearance of the
attractor when viscosity is included. As it will be shown later on an example, the build-
up of energy along an attractor can be impeded by the boundaries; this eﬀect therefore
puts an upper bound on the viscosity for the attractor to be visible. The dashed line
in the ﬁgure gives the lower bound (in distance) for physically relevant attractors (see
discussion and the example in §3.1).
2.2.5. Diﬀerences with billiards

It is interesting to compare the mapping deﬁned by (2.8-2.10) with the billiard problem
studied in classical chaos, where a particle bounces specularly on the walls of a cavity.
Billiard phase spaces are two-dimensional (position and velocity direction) while the
phase space of our problem is one-dimensional (in projection), since the only variable
is the position along the circles representing inner and outer shells. The problem is not
Hamiltonian, there is no conservation of the symplectic measure in phase space, and
attractors and repellors exist.

For the full sphere, η = 0, we have seen that all the orbits are neutral (Λ = 0) and
are either quasiperiodic (and ergodic) or periodic (when λ is a rational fraction of π).
When η is made nonzero, all quasiperiodic orbits are instantaneously destroyed, and the
periodic orbits remain neutral until they are eventually destroyed when η increases, the

rational values with smaller denominator surviving last. It is interesting to note that
this situation is exactly the opposite of the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem
valid for Hamiltonian systems close to integrability (see Arnold 1989). In this latter
case, it is well-known that for an integrable Hamiltonian system all orbits lie on tori, and
orbits are organized in families, either quasiperiodic (and ergodic) or periodic, for a given
torus. If one perturbs such an integrable Hamiltonian system by a suﬃciently smooth
perturbation, the KAM theorem states ﬁrst that all rational tori (with periodic orbits)
are instantaneously destroyed, and second that irrational tori (with quasiperiodic orbits)
disappear one after the other when the perturbation is increased, the last to disappear
being the ‘furthest’ to the rationals.

2.3. Relations between orbits of characteristics and eigenfunctions

In the preceding subsections we have shown that, generically, characteristics converge to-
wards attractors which are formed by a periodic orbit. These attractors live in a frequency
band whose size decreases with the length (or period) of the attractor. The attracting
power is measured by a negative Lyapunov exponent which generically varies between
0 and −∞ when the frequency band is scanned. Several (less than 6) attractors may
coexist for a given frequency; in this case they own each a basin of attraction (described
for instance as a set of points on the outer boundary) whose structure is governed by
accumulation points (see ﬁg. 4).

We have also found periodic orbits which are not attractors; their frequency can be
written ω = sin(pπ/2q) where (p, q) are chosen in a ﬁnite set of integers. The number of
these orbits is therefore ﬁnite but increases as the radius of the inner core decreases. The
frequencies of these orbits will prove to be useful since in their neighbourhood, attractors
have very great length and, therefore, very small (in absolute value) Lyapunov exponents.
This will inﬂuence the shape of the asymptotic spectrum (i.e. with low viscosities).

Now we shall see how the eigenfunctions are inﬂuenced by the presence of an attractor.

2.3.1. The two-dimensional case

Because of the simple form of the Poincar´e equation in two dimensions, which may be

written as

∂2P

∂u+∂u−

= 0

(2.17)

early investigations have focused on this case in particular those of mathematicians.
The relevant contributions are those of Bourgin & Duﬃn (1939), John (1941), Høiland
(1962), Franklin (1972), Ralston (1973) and Schaeﬀer (1975). Much of this previous work
is concentrated in a theorem demonstrated in Schaeﬀer (1975) which states that:

There are non-trivial solutions of (2.17) if and only if there exists an integer n such
that all reﬂected rays close after precisely 2n reﬂections. If there is one solution, then
there are inﬁnitely many, linearly independent solutions.

In other words, eigenvalues of regular modes are always associated with periodic orbits
and these eigenvalues are always inﬁnitely degenerate. Since the reﬂected rays must close,
starting from any point of the curve, the Lyapunov exponent of such periodic orbits is
always zero. Note the diﬀerence with the three-dimensional case where eigenmodes in the
full sphere are associated with ergodic (quasi-periodic) orbits (cf §2.2.2 and appendix A)
and eigenvalues are non-degenerate.
Another interesting result was derived from mathematical analysis by Ralston (1973).
Namely, it states that the velocity ﬁeld associated with a solution of (2.17) is not square-
integrable when characteristics are focused towards a wedge formed by the boundaries.

14

M. Rieutord, B. Georgeot and L. Valdettaro

An example of such a singular ﬂow is given in Wunsch (1968) with the case of internal
waves focused by a sloping boundary. In the interval of frequencies where the velocity
ﬁeld is not square-integrable, eigenvalues do not exist and the point spectrum of Poincar´e
operator is said to be empty.

The foregoing results may be generalized to our case, or the one studied by Maas & Lam
(1995), where characteristics are focused towards an attractor. Indeed, let us consider
the total kinetic energy of a ‘mode’ associated with an attractor; using characteristic
coordinates, this quantity reads

I =ZS k~vk2du+du− +ZCS k~vk2du+du−

where S designates a neighbourhood of the attractor and CS the remaining ‘volume’; we
assume that the limits of S are made up of characteristics. If the attractor is of length
N then this integral can be split into N pieces

I =

N

Xn=1ZSn k~vk2du+du−

where we neglected the contribution from CS. Now each of these pieces can be split again
into an inﬁnite number of rectangles Rk with sides made up of characteristics. Hence we
write

ZSn k~vk2du+du− =

∞

Xk=1ZRk k~vk2du+du− =

Ik

∞

Xk=1

In the vicinity of the attractor, these rectangles are very elongated: one side remains
O(1) long while the other shrinks to zero as the attractor is approached.
Now we take the two long sides as images through the mapping made by the charac-
teristics. The mapping has a contracting rate given by eΛ < 1 where Λ is its Lyapunov
exponent. Maas & Lam (1995) have shown how one can construct the stream function
in the whole domain by iterating an arbitrary function given on its boundary. When
the attractor is approached, the scale of the stream function vanishes while its ampli-
tude remains constant; therefore the kinetic energy is ampliﬁed by a factor e−2Λ at each
iteration of the mapping. Noting that one rectangle is smaller by a factor eΛ than its
predecessor, we can derive the iteration rule

Ik+1 = e−ΛIk

which shows that the integral I is inﬁnite. We may note in passing that if dk is the
distance of the kth characteristic to the limit cycle, then dk = d0ekΛ while the amplitude
of the velocity ﬁeld is vk = v0e−kΛ. This shows that the velocity ﬁeld diverges as the
inverse of the distance to the attractor.

Therefore, as in the case of a wedge, the velocity ﬁeld is not square-integrable when

characteristics converge towards an attractor.

2.3.2. The three-dimensional case

The 3-D case has not beneﬁtted from the same interest by mathematicians. In this case
the Poincar´e equation contains ﬁrst or zeroth order derivatives which cannot be elimi-
nated. Let us rewrite it using cylindrical coordinates and assume a exp(imϕ) dependence
of the pressure; thus

which is known as the Euler-Darboux equation (Dautray & Lions 1984-1985).

A general solution of Euler-Darboux equation may be obtained with Riemann’s method
(Colombo 1976; Zwillinger 1992). With this method one may express the value of the
solution at one point when ‘initial’ data are given on an arc joining two points on charac-
teristics ‘emitted’ from the point considered (see ﬁgure 10). However, one needs to know
the Riemann function (which plays an equivalent role to the Green’s function of elliptic
problems). To determine this function it is useful to rewrite the pressure ﬂuctuation as
P = Π/√s; doing so, the ﬁrst derivatives of Poincar´e equation are eliminated but are
replaced by the term Π/4s2. The equation for Π is therefore:

veriﬁes the diﬀerential equation:

z(1 − z)R′′ − (2z − 1)R′ + µ(µ − 1)R = 0

where we set µ = m + 1/2. This is a special case of the diﬀerential equation of Gauss
hypergeometric function, i.e. F (µ, 1 − µ; 1; z); in fact, it is just the equation satisﬁed by
Legendre functions of index µ − 1.
Since z ≡ z(S, M ), we shall write Riemann’s function as R(S; M ). Hence the formal

A simpler formula can be obtained for axisymmetric modes when the meridional stream

function ψ is considered†. After a similar transformation, where we set ψ = √sΨ, we
ﬁnd that the associated Riemann function is also a Legendre function with µ = −1/2.
If the arc P Q is taken on the boundary then Ψ = 0 and the expression (2.21) simpliﬁes

converging towards P SQT (i.e. those points at (φ3, φ4, φ1, φ2) respectively). (2.24) can

The two integrals in the RHS are of order unity and we surmise that they do not
cancel. Therefore the suite of C(Ψ)(Pn) is diverging which means that the velocity ﬁelds
tends to inﬁnity when a limit cycle is approached.
This result can be generalized to any limit cycle. We may also use it to generalize
Ralston’s theorem. However, in this latter case, it is more straightforward to note that if
we are considering characteristics converging towards a wedge (for a three-dimensional
problem), then in a neighbourhood of the apex of the wedge, ﬁrst order derivatives are
negligible compared to second order derivatives; therefore, in this neighbourhood, (2.18)
can be transformed into (2.17) and Ralston’s theorem applies.

2.4. The critical latitude singularity

The preceding discussion has shown (and proved in 2D) that the velocity ﬁeld of ‘modes’†
associated with an attractor is not square-integrable: it diverges as the inverse of the
distance to the attractor.

We shall see now that this singularity is not the only one and that a milder one develops
around the critical latitude of the inner sphere. Stewartson & Rickard (1969) were the
ﬁrst to notice that singularity and showed that it is integrable. Although the work of
Stewartson & Rickard (1969) was restricted to the thin shell limit and was based on the
use of Longuet-Higgins solutions of the Laplace tidal equation, we shall show that their
result is in fact general.

For quick reading demonstrations in §2.4.1 and §2.4.2 can be skipped.

2.4.1. The singular surfaces

Let us consider a sphere immersed in a rotating ﬂuid ﬁlling the whole space. We
examine the oscillations of the ﬂuid. Such modes are the corresponding modes of the full
sphere when solutions regular at the origin are replaced by solutions regular at inﬁnity.
As for the full sphere, we use Bryan’s transformation to convert the Poincar´e equation

into the Laplace equation. Thus we set

z′ = −i

ω
α

z

To solve Laplace’s equation, we therefore use ellipsoidal coordinates (ξ, θ, ϕ) similar to

the spherical coordinates (for the angular variables θ and ϕ):

† We use quotes because modes refer usually to regular solutions with square-integrable ve-

locity ﬁelds.

where a is the focal distance of the meridional ellipse. If we take the radius of the sphere
as the unit of length, then a = 1/α. We recall that using these coordinates, Laplace
equation of an axisymmetric ﬁeld transforms into :

with ∆ = η2 − µ2. Hence, the transform is singular on the surfaces such that η = ±µ.
Since the solution Qℓ(η)Pℓ(µ) is regular in the ﬂuid’s domain, the singularity of the
transformation makes the solutions singular when the coordinates map the space in a
regular way.

To discover which kind of surfaces hinds behind this equation (η = ±µ), it is convenient
to express ξ (or η) as a function of the cylindrical coordinates s and z. Eliminating θ
from (2.28) and setting X = sinh2 ξ, we ﬁnd that

X 2 + (1 + ω2z2 − α2s2)X + ω2z2 = 0

singular. The signs +/− refer to the sign of the discriminant D.

The solution of this equation gives the reciprocal transformation of coordinates (2.30)
or (2.28). When the roots are multiple, the transformation is singular; this happens when
the discriminant D vanishes which is when

D = (1 − ωz − αs)(1 − ωz + αs)(1 + ωz + αs)(1 + ωz − αs) = 0

One may easily verify that this equation is equivalent to η2 = µ2.

(2.33)

We have therefore shown that the transformation is singular on four surfaces which
are cones tangent to the sphere at the critical latitudes. This result is summarized in
ﬁgure 11.

2.4.2. The velocity ﬁeld near the critical latitudes

In order to present in a simple way the singularity of the velocity ﬁeld near the
critical latitude, we specialize our reasoning to the case of the tangent characteristic
ωz = 1 − αs which touches the sphere at s = α and z = ω. The velocity component
parallel to this characteristic is such that Vk = ωvs − αvz, or

Using (2.30) and (2.32), we ﬁnd that

Therefore, it turns out that if the right-hand side of this equation remains ﬁnite on
the singular surface, then the velocity component Vk diverges as 1/∆ = 1/√D. In the

neighbourhood of the singular surface, D vanishes linearly with the distance to this
surface; thus we see that the velocity ﬁeld will diverge as one over square root of the
distance to these surfaces as actually found by Stewartson & Rickard (1969) in the case
of a thin shell.

Let us show that the RHS of the latter equation is indeed ﬁnite. The characteristic

ωz = 1 − αs is such that µ = η, therefore

RHS = µ

functions; it is nonzero as Pℓ and Qℓ are linearly independent.

Finally, using the same kind of arguments one may also prove that the component
of the velocity ﬁeld in the azimuthal direction is also singular while the component
perpendicular to the singular surface remains ﬁnite.

We therefore see that the velocity ﬁeld possesses an integrable singularity but is not
square-integrable; thus, if strictly quasi-periodic trajectories of characteristics exist, they
would inevitably touch the critical latitude and their associated eigenfunction would be
singular. Therefore no eigenvalue can be associated with ergodic trajectories of charac-
teristics in a spherical shell.

2.5. The toroidal (regular) solutions

The foregoing two sections have shown us that inertial ‘modes’ of a sphericl shell hardly
escape to singularities: one question therefore raises up: do regular modes exist at all? the
answer is yes, indeed some regular solutions exist in the form of purely toroidal velocity
ﬁelds associated with eigenfrequencies ω = 1/(m + 1), m ∈ IN∗.
We pointed out these solutions in Rieutord & Valdettaro (1997) but they appeared
independently several times in the literature: Malkus (1967) noticed them while inves-
tigating hydromagnetic planetary waves and Papaloizou & Pringle (1978) called them
’r-modes’ because of their similarity with Rossby waves.

However, the existence of these solutions is somehow puzzling since a plot of the
trajectories of characteristics associated with these eigenvalues shows that most of them
converge towards an attractor (for instance, when m = 2); how can we reconcile these
two apparently contradictory facts?

The answer lies in the speciﬁc form of the Poincar´e equation in these cases. Indeed,
these modes are purely toroidal which means that for all points in the spherical shell
we have ~er · ~v = 0. From the expression of the velocity components as a function of the
pressure ﬂuctuation (see for instance Rieutord & Noui (1999)), this constraint can be
transformed into the following equation

They are therefore either straight lines parallel to the rotation axis ds = 0 or circles
parallel to the boundaries s2 + z2 = K. They cannot form orbits by reﬂections on the
boundaries and therefore they do not impose any constraint on the solution; regular so-
lutions are possible. In fact, because of the circular shape of one family of characteristics,
the variables of the problem can be separated and solutions are regular.

Regular inertial modes in a spherical shell therefore exist, but are these toroidal modes
the only regular modes? we have no mathematical proof of it but numerical computations
of the whole spectrum of eigenvalues including viscosity strongly suggest that this is
indeed the case. The argument is as follows: regular modes in a spherical shell meeting
stress-free boundary conditions have damping rates proportional to the viscosity which
will turn out to be very small compared to those of singular modes which, as we shall
see, develop shear layers. In a plot of the eigenvalues in the complex plane, regular modes
will pop out when the viscosity is suﬃciently low as can be seen in the context of gravity
modes in Rieutord & Noui (1999). Computations for diﬀerent m’s show that only one
eigenvalue popped out and that is the one of the toroidal mode.

2.6. A summary of the results on the inviscid problem

Before jumping into the question of how inertial modes of a spherical shell behave when a
slight amount of viscosity is included, it is certainly useful to summarize the main results
obtained in the foregoing sections on the inviscid problem.

We have seen in §2.3 that the nature (regular or singular) of eigenmodes is, with the
exception of toroidal modes, determined by the dynamics of characteristics. The study
of this dynamics (§2.2) revealed the generic property that characteristics converge to
attractors made of a periodic orbit which exist in some frequency band. These attractors
are also characterized by their length (i.e. the number of reﬂexions) which inﬂuence the
rate at which characteristics converge to them; this rate is given by a negative Lyapunov
exponent. When the frequency of the attractor is close to sin(pπ/2q) where p and q belong
to a ﬁnite set of integers determined by the size of the inner core, the corresponding
attractors are very long and weakly attractive. These frequencies are the ones for which
the shadow of the inner core follows a periodic orbit (see ﬁgure 5); they will prove to be
important in the determination of the asymptotic spectrum of inertial modes when the
viscosity vanishes.

The focusing of energy by attractors is not the only source of singularity: we have
shown that near the critical latitude of the inner boundary a milder singularity will
develop in general. This singularity will prove to be relevant in the viscous case when
shear layers associated with attractors are inhibited.

Finally, we found that some regular solutions still exist. They are purely toroidal modes
and we surmize that they are the only true eigenmodes of a rotating ﬂuid in a spherical
shell. From the mathematical point of view, the point spectrum of the Poincar´e operator
(i.e. eigenvalues associated with square-integrable functions) is almost empty.

3. The solutions with viscosity

3.1. General results

When viscosity is included the equations are elliptic and the problem is well-posed; hence,
the solutions are smooth C∞-functions which can be computed numerically. We shall not
describe the method used and refer the reader to Rieutord & Valdettaro (1997). We just
recall that we solve the eigenvalue problem (λ is the complex eigenvalue)

with stress-free boundary conditions to eliminate Ekman boundary layers; E = ν/2ΩR2
is the Ekman number, ν being the kinematic viscosity.

The main result, coming from numerical solutions of this problem, is that the amplitude
of the modes is concentrated along paths of characteristics drawn by attractors. However,
as found by Dintrans et al. (1999) and Rieutord & Valdettaro (1997), the attractor
appears in the viscous solutions only when the Ekman number is low enough. This
critical Ekman number, below which the mode seems to reach an asymptotic shape,
depends on the length of the attractor; short (and simple) attractors appear at higher
viscosities than long (and complex) attractors which may never appear within the range

of physically relevant Ekman numbers (E >∼10−18).

In order to investigate the properties of viscous solutions associated with attractors,
we shall focus on a few simple ones which appear at reasonable Ekman numbers (i.e.
larger than 10−9). Some are the ones displayed in ﬁgure 7 plus two others located in
the 0.6–0.625 frequency band, one of which was considered by Israeli (1972) using a thin
shell.

A plot of the eigenmodes associated with these four attractors is shown in ﬁgure 12.
This ﬁgure displays the kinetic energy of the modes in a meridional section of the shell.
As expected the kinetic energy focuses around the attractors which we overplot on each
diagram; however, this is not systematic as shown by ﬁgure 12c: there, the kinetic energy
concentrates along a characteristic path starting at the critical latitude rather than along
the (only) existing attractor. We understand this situation as the consequence of the
location of the attractor: one of its segments is indeed almost tangential to the outer
sphere which therefore inhibits the development of the shear layer. By computing the
distance between the boundary and the attractor, we estimate that a E1/4-shear layer is
inhibited by the boundary if the Ekman number is larger than 10−11. Such low Ekman
numbers are out of reach numerically at the moment. This example illustrates the point
mentioned in §2.2.4: very long attractors will appear at extremely low Ekman numbers.
If we consider that lowest Ekman numbers are those of stars (∼ 10−18) or the Earth’s
core (∼ 10−16) and if we use the same scaling as above for shear layers, then we can
conclude (from ﬁgure 9) that attractors longer than ∼ 100 will never appear in physical
systems.
We therefore see that, although the singularity associated with an attractor is stronger
than that of the critical latitude, this latter singularity may show up if, for some reason,
the build up of shear layers around the attractor is inhibited. We surmise that ‘long’
attractors, will dominate relative to the critical latitude singularity only at very low
Ekman numbers. ‘Short’ attractors may therefore appear more easily as in ﬁgure 12a
while still showing, weakly, the critical latitude singularity.

Another surprising feature of the rays (i.e. shear layers) lying along an attractor is
that the maximum energy density is not always centered on the attractor (ﬁgure 12b or
12d). We discuss this point below.

To make some progress in the understanding of this complex behaviour we shall inves-

tigate in more detail the structure of shear layers lying near the attractors.

3.2. Structure of shear layers

Figure 12. Distribution of kinetic energy in the meridional section of the shell for four diﬀerent
axisymmetric modes. These solutions have been computed numerically using the same code as
in Rieutord & Valdettaro (1997). On each panel, τ is the damping rate, stress-free boundary
conditions are used, L is the number of spherical harmonics and Nr is the number of grid points
in the radial direction. (a) shows the mode associated with the equatorial attractor (in blue) of
ﬁgure 7a while the polar attractor (in green) is only weakly visible. (b) Using a more damped
mode with a slightly diﬀerent frequency, we obtain a case where the polar attractor is fueled
with energy. In (c) the attractor considered by Israeli (1972) should be fueled, but is in fact
hampered by the boundary and the critical latitude singularity dominates the ﬂow. (d) A very
neat mode which concentrates along its attractor; in blue the corresponding equatorial attractor.

3.2.1. Some numerical results

As a preliminary step, we ﬁrst compute the variations of the components of the velocity

ﬁeld along a line crossing a ray perpendicularly. Results are displayed in ﬁgure 13.

These proﬁles show that these internal shear layers have a rather complex structure

24

Figure 13. Left: the real and imaginary parts of Vϕ in the cross-section of the attractor displayed
in ﬁgure 12a. The segments with positive slope have been shown in cross section. The + sign
overplotted on the curves represents the variations of iVk; the perfect matching with the curves
of Vϕ shows that the phase quadrature between these components is well veriﬁed as expected
from (3.8) or (3.13). The dashed line shows the amplitude of the |~v| proﬁle and the two crosses
on the y-axis indicate the position of the attractor. Right: same as on left but for a mode with
more complex rays: it is a cut through the rays with negative slope of the mode of ﬁgure 12d;
the cut starts near the critical latitude and is perpendicular to the rays.

which looks like a plane inertial wave trapped in a ‘potential well’. Each mode seems
to be characterized by the number of nodes in the cross-section of its rays, just like a
solution of a Sturm-Liouville problem. The analogy cannot, however, be pushed too far
since the actual oscillations do not disappear outside the rays but continue with a very
low amplitude (the well is leaking!). This is a consequence of the fact that the ‘well’ is
not a local well but the result of a mapping made by the convergence of characteristics
towards the attractor. We also surmise that since the convergence rate is not the same
on each side of the attractor†, the ‘potential well’ is certainly not symmetric with respect
to the attractor; we thus explain our ﬁnding that the maxima of kinetic energy density
are not centered right on the attractor as shown by ﬁgures 12b,d or 13.

In the above view, the shear layers result from a balance of the focusing action of the
mapping and the ‘defocusing’ action of viscosity; because the former action is global and
the latter is local, the boundary layer analysis is diﬃcult, if not impossible. The following
analysis gives some general properties of these shear layers, properties which are actually
observed numerically, but is not able to reproduce their detailed structure.

3.2.2. Boundary layer analysis

In order to describe the shear layers featuring the inertial modes of a spherical shell,

it is convenient to project the equations in the characteristics’ directions.

† We mean here at some ﬁnite distance from the attractor; right on the attractor the conver-

gence rate is given by the Lyapunov exponent.

From (2.7), we derive the expressions of unit vectors parallel (k) or perpendicular (⊥)

to characteristics of positive (+) or negative (−) slope:

~e k

~e⊥
± = ω~ez ∓ α~es

Restricting ourselves to the case of a characteristic with positive slope, the components

of the velocity in a meridional plane are:

V⊥ = −αVs + ωVz

a dependence from our equations by setting ~V = ~u/√s and P = p/√s. Hence, (3.3) and
(3.5) yield

Since (3.11) describes detached shear layers, the function Hm needs to vanish when
t → ±∞ which is possible only if m < 0 (Moore & Saﬀman 1969). The shape of this
function is given in ﬁgure 14.
3 layer we need to determine the index m of the
Moore and Saﬀman function. For this purpose, we ﬁrst note from (3.11) that the width
of the layer is singular at the origin of the x-axis. This origin can therefore be considered
as a virtual source of the ray which obviously lies outside the ﬂuid’s container. Let us
therefore consider a segment of a mode around an attractor. Let us orient the x-axis in
the direction of contraction of the map and call x0 the abscisse of the ﬁrst point of this
segment (point B in ﬁgure 15). At B the width of the layer is proportional to x1/3
0 while

28

M. Rieutord, B. Georgeot and L. Valdettaro

the amplitude of uϕ is proportional to xm
0 Hm(0). At C and before reﬂection, the width
is (x0 + ℓ)1/3 and the amplitude is (x0 + ℓ)mHm(0); after reﬂection, the mapping changes
the scale by a factor K; therefore the width is now (x0 + ℓ)1/3K and the amplitude
(x0 + ℓ)mHm(0)/K. The width is just as though the virtual source A′ were at a distance
(x0 + ℓ)K 3 of C while the amplitude would imply a distance (x0 + ℓ)K −1/m; since the
segment starting at C must also be a solution of the form (3.11), the new virtual source
must be at the same position for both the amplitude and width; therefore, we need to
have

This index was also found by Stewartson (1972a) on the argument that it is the only

one for which the ﬂux

is conserved along the ray, which means that the 1

3 layer does no pumping.

From the property that Hm(t) ∼ t3m as t → ∞, we see that the solution (3.11) is

independent of x far from the layer and decreases as 1/y.

3.2.4. The outer E1/4-layer

Since some modes show a clear scaling of their ray with the 1

4 exponent (see Rieutord

& Valdettaro 1997), we also brieﬂy discuss this case.

We cannot say much more about the 1

4 -layer, except that the expansions to higher
orders including viscous terms lead to a diﬀerential equation for F which is not closed,
some additional functions missing their diﬀerential equation. If these extra and undeter-
mined functions are set to zero, F obeys, as expected, a fourth order diﬀerential equation
whose solutions do not agree (in general) with the numerical results. We think that this
is due to the action of the mapping which is obviously missing in the local analysis;
unfortunately, we have not yet found a way to include it.

3.2.5. Wave packet kinematics

In order to give a more physical understanding of the behaviour of shear layers as
viscosity is reduced, we propose to consider a wave packet traveling around an attractor.
Let us suppose that the Ekman number is very small but ﬁnite. When traveling along
an attractor a wave packet is damped by viscosity but its reﬂections on the boundaries
enhance it if the direction of propagation is such that the map is contracting (Λ < 0);
this equilibrium may be written as:

(3.14)
where N is the length of the attractor, Λ its Lyapunov exponent†, tn the time elapsed

(3.15)

where we have introduced the length ℓn of each segment of the attractor; we also used

the fact that ks = k√1 − ω2 so that tn = ℓnkn/√1 − ω2 and all quantities are now

dimensionless. Since kn = Cnkn−1, Cn > 1 being the contraction coeﬃcient of the nth

is a purely geometrical quantity describing the path of characteristics associated with the
attractor at the frequency ω. The expression (3.16) expresses through (3.14) the strict
periodicity of the amplitude of the velocity ﬁeld along an attractor when viscosity is
small but ﬁnite.

A similar relation may be derived if we now express that the scale of a wave packet must
be the same after one cycle along the attractor. In a purely diﬀusive (viscous) process,
the scale of a structure, initially being ‘a’ grows like √a2 + νt with time; therefore the
relation between the layer’s width after one propagation and one reﬂection is

We therefore see that the 1
3 -exponent is a limit case. In fact this inequality shows that
‘naked’ 1
3 -layers cannot exist and should be embeded in thicker layers; this seems to be
the case indeed, at least for all the modes which we investigated in detail: they usually
show σ ≃ 1/4.

3.3. The asymptotic spectrum

The foregoing calculations show one important result: As viscosity tends to zero and
since k1 ∝ E−σ, from (3.16) we may conclude that the Lyapunov exponent of attractors
must vanish as viscosity vanishes following the law Λ ∝ E1−3σ. It therefore turns out
that eigenfrequencies will converge towards the roots ωi of the equation Λ(ω) = 0 which
therefore describe the asymptotic spectrum of inertial modes in a spherical shell. From
the fact that only a ﬁnite number of attractors exist at a given frequency, we deduce that
the spectrum cannot be dense in [0,1] contrary to the case of the full sphere. However,
this spectrum has some accumulation points ωa which are due to the existence of neutral
(Λ = 0) periodic orbits with frequencies sin pπ/2q (see §2.2.2). Indeed, in the neighbour-
hood of such points we may ﬁnd attractors which are longer and longer, the closer they
are to ωa. However, the number of accumulation points is ﬁnite and given by the number
of pairs (p, q) possible for periodic orbits of the shadow and when η ≥ 1/√2 only three
such points (ω = 0, 1/√2, 1) exist. In ﬁgure 16 we clearly see the accumulation points cor-
responding to sin(π/4) and sin(π/6)†. When η → 0, the number of accumulation points
gets larger and larger, as more and more rationals are added to the set of accumulation

† The case sin(π/8) is not as clear for it needs a much higher frequency resolution since the

shadow almost ﬁlls the whole volume as π/8 ∼ arcsin(0.35).

points, a situation in accordance with the fact that at η = 0 the spectrum is dense in
[0, 1].

Let us also underline the fact that when E = 0, eigenvalues disappear since solutions
of the equations are no longer square-integrable; this is also true for frequencies of at-
tractors such that Λ = 0, since attractors still focus the energy (but algebraically, not
exponentially).

For a given upper bound of the damping rate, eigenvalues will be packed around
the roots ωi and around the allowed frequencies of the set sin(pπ/2q). In ﬁgure 17, we
computed the distribution of least-damped eigenvalues when E = 10−8, i.e. for 140
evenly spaced frequencies between 0 and 1/√2, we computed the eight least-damped
modes. This ﬁgure oﬀers a glimpse at the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues in the
complex plane: we clearly see three main bands† of attractors where modes are more
damped and the two frequencies sin(π/6) and sin(π/4) where least-damped modes tend
to accumulate; the sin(π/4) case is conspicuous. Note also the similarity with ﬁgure 16
where the three bands made by the aforementioned attractors are also clearly visible.

From the asymptotic behaviour (2.16) of the Lyapunov exponent in the vicinity of the

roots ωi, we can derive that

This asymptotic behaviour of eigenvalues is best illustrated in ﬁgure 18 where
σ = 1/4. Such a mode is the least-damped one in its frequency range and is therefore
not perturbed by other eigenvalues. This is likely the reason why it shows its asymptotic
regime at rather ‘high’ Ekman numbers.

Concerning the eigenmodes, it is worth noting that (2.16) and (B 9) imply that the
spacing of adjacent rays scales like E1/4 (if σ = 1/4); therefore, the distance between two
rays of an attractor remains the same when it is rescaled by E1/4 and one may conclude
that each mode in the form of a viscous attractor keeps a self-similar structure as the
Ekman number vanishes.

4. Discussion

Ending this paper, we think that the asymptotic behaviour of inertial modes in a
spherical shell when the Ekman number vanishes can be anticipated even if some points
remain in the shadows.

We have seen at the beginning of the paper that the trajectories of characteristics in
general converge towards an attractor; exceptions are when the sphere is full or the inner
core is small enough to let a ﬁnite number of periodic orbits remain (which are associated
with critical latitudes commensurable with π). Leaving the full sphere for which analytical
solutions exist since Bryan (1889), the generic behaviour of characteristics is that they
converge towards an attractor which is a periodic orbit residing in some frequency band.
The knowledge of the characteristic trajectories can be used immediately in two-
dimensional problems in order to construct a solution of the inviscid problem. This
solution contains an arbitrary function which needs to be speciﬁed on some fundamental
interval(s). This makes the eigenvalues always inﬁnitely degenerate. In three dimensions,
the trajectories cannot be used so eﬃciently but their convergence towards an attractor
can be used to show the divergence of the velocity ﬁeld at zero viscosity. In two dimen-
sions, this divergence allowed us to prove the non-square-integrability of velocity ﬁelds
associated with attractors, implying the absence of eigenvalues in a large fraction of the
frequency band [0, 2Ω].

Beside the singularities generated by attractors, we also shed new light on the singu-
larity arising at the critical latitude of the inner shell. We thus generalized the result of
Stewartson & Rickard (1969) that the velocity ﬁeld diverges as the inverse of the square
root of the distance to the characteristic grazing the inner shell; this singularity also
makes the velocity ﬁeld not square-integrable.

Among all these singular solutions, a small set of regular modes ‘survive’: they are
purely toroidal modes which, thanks to a velocity ﬁeld which has no radial component,
do not suﬀer the constraints imposed by characteristics paths. Numerical computations
of the whole spectrum give a strong evidence that these modes are the only regular ones.
When viscosity is included, all the aforementioned singularities appear in the form of
shear layers. In the asymptotic r´egime, we therefore expect that attractors will feature
the viscous solutions. However, this asymptotic r´egime may be reached at extremely
low values of the Ekman number, some of which may not even be relevant astrophysi-
cally or geophysically. We may therefore face some intermediate r´egime where the milder
singularity at critical latitude plays an important part in featuring the amplitude of a
mode.

Our numerical investigations of the structure of shear layers which are generated by the
diﬀerent singularities revealed a rather complex structure of nested layers scaling with Eσ,
0 < σ < 1/3 where the value σ = 1/4 seems to be favoured. In some simple cases, where
the velocity ﬁeld shows no node in the transverse direction of a shear layer, numerical

Inertial waves in a rotating spherical shell: attractors and asymptotic spectrum 33

results indeed show a scaling with E1/4. Our boundary layer analysis demonstrated that
all these internal layers should contain an inner σ = 1
3 -layer which is similar to the
vertical Stewartson layers; however, the mapping made by characteristics inﬂuences the
scales larger than E1/3 and therefore makes a local analysis insuﬃcient to determine the
structure of the outer parts of the layers.

The upper bound σ < 1/3 has been derived using a heuristic model of an inertial wave
packet traveling along an attractor; from this model, we also showed that the asymptotic
spectrum of eigenvalues can be derived, once the structure of the shear layer can be
computed. An important result of this analysis is that the limits of eigenfrequencies as
E → 0, do not form a dense set in [0, 2Ω] contrary to the case of the full sphere.
The asymptotic behaviour of inertial modes and their associated eigenvalues is there-
fore slowly becoming clearer: As the Ekman number decreases, more and more eigen-
modes are concentrated along the attractors associated with their frequency; once this
asymptotic regime is reached the frequency of the mode changes slowly with viscosity
so that the Lyapunov exponent of the attractor decreases (in absolute value) and con-
verges toward the frequency where this exponent is zero. We are thus in the position of
describing r´egimes with extremely low values of the Ekman numbers that are relevant in
astrophysics (E = 10−18 for a radiative zone of a star) or geophysics (E = 10−15 for the
liquid core of the Earth) and which are way out of reach numerically.

However, some points remain in the shadows, the most challenging one being the
structure of the shear layers. As we observed, this structure builds up from a large scale
phenomenon which is represented by the mapping of characteristics and a small-scale
one which is diﬀusion. To the best of our knowledge, such a problem has never been
investigated in the past. Since the three-dimensional case is much more involved than
the two dimensional case, because of the intrusion of Riemann functions, we think that
this latter case should be investigated ﬁrst; this will be the subject of future work.

The foregoing results were derived from the analysis of inertial waves of a ﬂuid con-
tained in a spherical shell but it is clear that they are of wider generality. They can
be easily generalized to any container of the same topology, like ellipsoidal shells, or be
used qualitatively for any kind of container. In the case of ellipsoidal shells, even axial
symmetry can be relaxed: since constraints imposed by characteristic surfaces are in a
meridional plane, no small-scale should appear in the ϕ-direction. Attractors are robust
structures and only the longest ones are sensitive to small modiﬁcations of the shape of
the boundaries; however, as they would transform into other long attractors, the ﬁnal
solution would not be much aﬀected. This kind of ‘structural stability’ is important when
applying these results to real objects like the core of the Earth which is obviously not a
perfect spherical shell (see the discussion in Rieutord 2000a).

Our results also naturally extend to all systems governed by a spatially hyperbolic
equations. Hence, one will ﬁnd similar properties for gravity modes (Maas & Lam 1995;
Rieutord & Noui 1999) or hydromagnetic modes (Malkus 1967).

Now the next question raised by our results concern their implications when the modes
are of ﬁnite amplitude. These may concern the development of the elliptic instability since
this instability is precisely an instability of inertial modes (see Rieutord 2000a) or may
aﬀect the transport properties of the ﬂuid which are much enhanced around attractors
(Maas et al. 1997; Dintrans et al. 1999; Dauxois & Young 1999).

In the same context, one may wonder whether the attractors can be studied exper-
imentally. At the moment, only one attractor has been detected experimentally, using
gravity waves of a stably stratiﬁed ﬂuid (Maas et al. 1997) or inertial waves (Maas 2000).
The main obstacle for detecting attractors with experiments is the rather large value of

34

M. Rieutord, B. Georgeot and L. Valdettaro

the Ekman number of experiments. Numerical calculations have indeed shown that this
number should not exceed a few 10−8. Using water in a spherical shell with a radius of
20 cm demands a rotational speed of 12000 rpm which is diﬃcult to achieve and raises
experimental problems. Also attractors should not be confused with other phenomena
which emphasize characteristics paths like the critical latitude singularity or a forced
perturbation like a discontinuity in velocity forced by boundary conditions (e.g. the split
disk case).

Finally, these new features of inertial modes may also have some interesting conse-
quences in astrophysics. It is now well-known that rapidly rotating neutron stars can
lose a substantial amount of angular momentum when some inertial modes become un-
stable because of a coupling with gravitational radiation (see Andersson 1998; Lindblom
et al. 1998). This instability therefore controls the rotation speed limit of neutron stars
and this limit would be the higher, the more damped are inertial modes. Stars with a
core or density jump will therefore be more stable than others, a fact which may be used
to give new constraints on the state of matter inside neutron stars (Rieutord 2000b).

In this appendix, we show in which cases sin(pπ/q) is the square root of a rational.

Appendix A. arcsin(p3/7)
This establishes that p3/7 is not the sinus of any rational fraction of π. The proof may

exist in the mathematical literature, but we have not been able to locate it; we therefore
propose here a simple proof of the result.

Let p/q be a rational number, p and q being coprimes, and let us suppose that

sin(pπ/q) = pa/b, where a/b is a rational number. Then cos 2pπ/q = 1 − 2 sin2 pπ/q

Let us take ﬁrst the case where q is prime. Then exp(2ipπ/q) is a qth root of unity,

will be a rational number.

and as such is a solution of:

provided q > 1. But one has also:

X q−1 + X q−2 + ··· + 1 = 0,

X q−1 + X q−2 + ··· + 1 =

q−1

Ym=1(cid:16)X − ei2mπ/q(cid:17) ,

(A 1)

(A 2)

since the exp(i2mπ/q), m = 1, . . . , q − 1 are roots of the polynomial (called cyclotomic
polynomial).
Since exp(i2pπ/q) is root of this polynomial, so is exp(−i2pπ/q), and they are diﬀerent

if q > 2. The product (A 2) thus contains

(X − exp(i2pπ/q))(X − exp(−i2pπ/q)) = X 2 − 2X cos(2pπ/q) + 1

(A 3)
Therefore, since cos(2pπ/q) is rational, X 2 − 2X cos(2pπ/q) + 1 is a rational polynomial,
which divides the cyclotomic polynomial X q−1 + X q−2 + . . . + 1. But Gauss proved (see

Inertial waves in a rotating spherical shell: attractors and asymptotic spectrum 35

Jacobson (1985) p. 272) that this polynomial is irreducible in the ﬁeld of rationals if q is
prime. Therefore the degree of this polynomial, which is q − 1, cannot exceed two, since
otherwise it would be reducible. So q = 1, 2, 3 are the only possibilities.
If q is not prime, then the polynomial X q−1 + X q−2 + . . . + 1 is not irreducible. But
exp(2ipπ/q) is still a qth root of unity. If exp(2ipmπ/q) 6= 1 for all m < q, one says
that exp(2ipπ/q) is a primitive qth root of unity. exp(i2pπ/q) is a primitive qth root of
unity since p is prime to q (Hardy & Wright (1975)). Then obviously exp(−i2pπ/q) is
a primitive qth root, diﬀerent from exp(i2pπ/q) since q > 2. Therefore the polynomial
whose roots are all the primitive qth roots of unity contains the factor (A 3). But this
polynomial is irreducible in Q (cyclotomic polynomial) (see Hardy & Wright (1975),
Jacobson (1985)). So if the degree of the polynomial is greater than two, there is a
contradiction. The degree of the polynomial is equal to the Euler function φ(q) which is
the number of positive integers not greater than and prime to q. One has φ(q) > 2 for
q > 6.

Therefore the only possible values for q are q = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. By direct veriﬁcation, one

sees that p3/7 is not sin(pπ/q) for one of these q.

The equatorial attractor drawn in ﬁgure 7a exists for all λ’s such that the following

B.2.1. General result

In this subsection we prove that generically near a critical latitude λ0 which displays
a periodic orbit having Λ = 0, the Lyapunov exponent behaves like the square root of
the variation of the critical latitude. Actually, this is a general result valid for a one-
dimensional mapping that depends on one control parameter (λ in our case) near a
tangent bifurcation point, provided the mapping is suﬃciently smooth there.

Let f (φ, λ) be the mapping (for φ, in our case it is f N (φ) with f deﬁned in (2.11) and
N is the period of the orbit) depending on the parameter λ. Let λ0 be the value of λ for
which Λ = 0, and φ0 the ﬁxed point of the corresponding map (f (φ0, λ0) = φ0). λ0 is a
bifurcation point, as illustrated in ﬁgure 19, and therefore ∂f /∂φ|φ0,λ0 = 1.

Let φ1 be a ﬁxed point for the mapping at λ1 near λ0: φ1 = f (φ1, λ1). Let us deﬁne

Appendix C. The number of attractors at a given frequency

We show here that the number of periodic orbits for a given frequency is bounded by

the number of discontinuous points.

To demonstrate this point, let us suppose the mapping has p discontinuities. This
means that f k will have kp discontinuities, since the image of any discontinuous point is
a discontinuous point. This means that f k is C∞ on kp interval. Each interval is bounded
by two discontinuous points.

When an attractor of period n appears, it means that the orbit bounces n times on the
outer shell. Therefore, n intervals in the graph of f n will cross the straight line y = x,
where they will be locked in subsequent iterations of f n.

We shall denote by φ1 the attractive point closest to the end of the interval, and by
φ2 the nearest discontinuous point of f n, which bounds the locked interval; thus, [φ1, φ2[
belongs to the basin of attraction of f n. Now, φ1 is a ﬁxed point of f n and therefore
of any iteration of f n or f −n. On the contrary, φ2 is not. It is a point of discontinuity
of f n, therefore f −n(φ2) is a point of discontinuity of f 2n. Thus, f −n([φ1, φ2[) belongs
to the basin of attraction of f 2n; since, in general, f −n(φ2) 6= φ2, f −n([φ1, φ2[) is not a
continuous interval and we see that the basin of attraction of f 2n contains at least two

40

intervals: [φ1, φ2[ and some other interval in the neighbourhood of f −n(φ2) (for instance
I =]f −n(φ2), f −n(φ3)] in ﬁgure 20). Therefore at the stage 2n, one of the new intervals
created falls into the basin. This is true near all the n attracting points of f n, so n
additional intervals fall into the basin at the stage 2n. After n other iterations, f −2n(φ2)
will be a new point of discontinuity of f 3n, not present in f n and f 2n, and the same
argument shows that n additional intervals at least fall into the basin at stage 3n.

This indicates that for each n iteration, n additional intervals (at least) are in the
basin of attraction of the attractor of period n. Let us therefore consider a case with
two attractors of period n1 and n2; after n1 iterations we get n1p intervals bounded by
discontinuities but the attractor has captured n1 intervals; therefore outside the basin of
attraction of the ﬁrst attractor, we have, for the n1-iterate, n1(p − 1) ‘free’ intervals at
most; if the mapping is iterated n1n2 times, we have n1n2(p− 1) free intervals. These free
intervals contain the basin of attraction of the second attractor; but after n1n2 iterations
the second attractor has captured n1n2 intervals, therefore only n1n2(p − 1) − n1n2 =
n1n2(p − 2) are really free. Following this reasoning for a third attractor, we would get
n1n2n3(p−3) free intervals left. Thus not more than p attractors can exist simultaneously.
It is interesting to note that numerically the number of attractors was always found
smaller or equal to p/2. We note that the argument above is actually an upper bound.
In practice, the preimage of [φ2, φ1] can include other points of discontinuity already
existing, and more than n intervals can fall in the basin after each n iterations of the
mapping.

The above argument is valid provided there is only one attractive point by interval
between two discontinuous points. Actually, we never found through extensive numerical
simulations of the mapping, a case where several attracting orbits coexist on the same
interval (apart for the values of the frequency where families of neutral orbits exist).
Actually, such a case would be related to a period-doubling bifurcation which cannot exist
in our system since one cannot cross the straight line y = x with a negative derivative.
Even if several orbits can coexist on a given interval, this will happen at a ﬁnite iteration
of the mapping and the total number of periodic orbits will remain ﬁnite, since the
argument above shows that the number of such intervals is ﬁnite.

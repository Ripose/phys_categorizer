An alternative method is suggested for the description of the velocity and pressure ﬁelds

in an unbounded incompressible viscous ﬂuid induced by an arbitrary number of spheres

moving and rotating in it. Within the framework of this approach, we obtain the general

relations for forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the spheres. The behavior of the

translational, rotational, and coupled friction and mobility tensors in various frequency

domains are analyzed up to the terms of the third order in the dimensionless parameter

b equal to the ratio of a typical radius of a sphere to the penetration depth of transverse

waves and a certain power of the dimensionless parameter σ equal to the ratio of a typical

radius of a sphere to the distance between the centers of two spheres. We establish that

the retardation eﬀects can essentially aﬀect the character of the hydrodynamic interactions

between the spheres.

I. INTRODUCTION

The theory of hydrodynamic interactions between particles of ﬁnite size immersed in a

viscous ﬂuid is of great interest for numerous problems of the modern physics and tech-

nology such as the theory of Brownian motion [1–6] stimulated by the results of numerical

calculations on computers (including ”Brownian dynamics” in computational physics [7]),

sedimentation [8,9], etc. As a rule, the central problem of the theory is to determine forces

and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on particles moving and rotating in it with given trans-

lational and angular velocities. To this end, the linearized Navier–Stokes equation for the

ﬂuid is usually used [8,10]. Starting from this equation, a great number of rigorous results

has been obtained for a single sphere in a ﬂuid [11–16]. For more than one sphere, there

are only a few rigorous results obtained for two spheres in some particular cases of their

stationary motion and rotation [17–20]. As for the nonstationary case, any exact results for

the ﬂuid velocity and pressure induced by two and more interacting spheres are absent.

The situation with ﬁnding approximate solutions of the linearized Navier–Stokes equation

is more advanced (ﬁrst of all, at the expense of the classical method of reﬂections proposed

by Smoluchowski and its further modiﬁcations). The comprehensive review of the results

obtained in this way is given in [8] including the cases of mixed slip-stick boundary conditions

at the surfaces of the spheres [21–25] and permeable spheres [26–28]. It follows that the

majority of these results have been obtained in the stationary case and mainly for two

spheres, and the possibility of an application of the corresponding methods to nonstationary

many-sphere problems is not clear.

In [4,29], on the basis of the method of induced forces proposed in [30], it was developed

a procedure of the derivation of a hierarchy of equations for irreducible force multipoles

induced in spheres immersed in a ﬂuid. Using this procedure, the friction and mobility

tensors of a system of an arbitrary number of spheres are obtained in the stationary case

and the results are represented in the form of power series expansions in the dimensionless

parameter σ equal to the ratio of a typical radius of a sphere to the distance between the

2

centers of two spheres retaining in the series terms up to a certain order in this parameter.

This method essentially diﬀers from the methods of reﬂections and gives one the possibility

to ﬁnd the friction and mobility tensors without knowledge of the ﬂuid velocity and pressure

in an explicit form. Furthermore, the method is free from the restriction to the stationarity

of the system.

Its generalization to the nonstationary case has been done in [31] where

the expressions for the mobility tensors have been represented in the form of power series

expansions in two dimensionless parameters: σ, which is typical of the stationary case, and

the parameter b, which is the ratio of a typical radius of a sphere to the penetration depth of

transverse waves. At ﬁnite frequencies, the expressions for the mobility tensors are obtained

in [31] up to the third order in these two dimensionless parameters, namely, up to terms of

the order of bnσm with n + m = 3, where n, m = 0, 1, 2, 3.

There are some other methods [32–38] proposed for determination of an approximate

solution of problems of many-sphere hydrodynamic interactions in a ﬂuid in both the sta-

tionary and nonstationary cases. As compared with the method of induced forces used in

[4,29,31], these methods enable one to calculate not only forces and torques exerted by the

ﬂuid on spheres but also the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid induced by these spheres (since the

latter problem is much more complicated, usually only the hydrodynamic forces and torques

are calculated.)

The original analytic-numerical method has been used in [36] to study the quasistatic

hydrodynamic interactions in a system of N spherical particles. Unlike the other methods,

this method is not based on using the conventional scheme of the representation of the

quantities under study as series expansions in powers of the parameter σ but reduces the

problem to the speciﬁc solution of an inﬁnite system of linear equations. With this method,

in [36], the stationary mobility tensors for a system of two interacting spheres of equal

radii have been obtained and analyzed in detail. In [37], the method has been extended to

the description of the retarded hydrodynamic interaction between two equal spheres in an

unbounded ﬂuid. The nonstationary mobility tensors of this system have been calculated

and plotted versus the variable b for several values of the parameter σ. Note that these

3

numerical results are not restricted to the range of small values of b like in [31] where the

corresponding analytic relations for the mobility tensors are deduced.

As for the method developed in [34,35], it should be noted that the ﬁnal results presented

in these papers are expressed in terms of multiindex tensors deﬁned as tensors inverse to

certain rather complicated multiindex tensors but the explicit expressions for these inverse

tensors are not given. Naturally, without knowledge of the explicit form for the inverse

tensors, the expressions given in [34,35] cannot be reduced to the known results obtained

by other methods. Moreover, it can be shown [39] that one of the inverse tensors deﬁning

in [34,35] the relations for the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the spheres and

the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid induced by the spheres does not exist (even for noninteracting

spheres) because the corresponding direct tensor is singular. In [39], the reasons for this

fact have been analyzed in detail, and the procedure has been proposed for ﬁnding the time-

dependent distributions of the velocity and pressure ﬁelds in an unbounded incompressible

viscous ﬂuid in an arbitrary external force ﬁeld induced by any number of spheres immersed

in the ﬂuid as well the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the spheres.

In the

stationary case, this program has been performed for the derivation of the general relations

for the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of the ﬂuid, the friction and mobility tensors for any

number of spheres in a ﬂuid in given external force ﬁelds and these results are represented in

the form of power series expansions in the dimensionless parameter σ retaining in the series

terms of the second iteration inclusive.

However, it is well known [14,16] that even in the case of a single sphere an account of

time dependence can lead to signiﬁcant changes both in the ﬂuid velocity induced by the

sphere moving in the ﬂuid with time-dependent velocity and in the force exerted by the ﬂuid

on the sphere, namely, the asymptotics of the ﬂuid velocity, being of the order of 1/r, where

r is the distance from the center of the sphere to the point of observation, for the stationary

motion of the sphere, is replaced by 1/r3 and the time-dependent force exerted by the ﬂuid

on the sphere, in addition to the ordinary Stokes friction term, contains a term depending on

the acceleration of the sphere and a memory term associated with hydrodynamic retardation

4

eﬀects. In the nonstationary case, hydrodynamic interactions between spheres also change,

which is especially signiﬁcant for large distances between the spheres. For example, certain

mobility tensors, which are proportional to the inverse distance between spheres to certain

powers in the stationary case, exponentially vanish with increase in the distance between the

spheres in the nonstationary case [31]. The account of the main frequency-dependent terms

in the mobilities in the case of small frequencies leads to long-time tails for the velocity

correlation functions of two diﬀerent spheres [31].

Naturally, it is of interest to investigate the nonstationary velocity and pressure ﬁelds of

the ﬂuid induced by several spheres immersed in the ﬂuid. However, this problem cannot

be solved with the use of the methods exploited in the pioneering papers [4,29,31]. It is also

of interest to extend the analytic results for the nonstationary mobilities obtained in [31]

retaining higher-order terms as well as to derive frequency-dependent friction tensors for a

system of spheres. These problems are considered in the present paper.

In Sec. 2, we give the general relations for the ﬂuid velocity and pressure induced by

a system of arbitrary number of spheres and the total forces and torques exerted by the

ﬂuid and external force ﬁelds on the spheres. The results are obtained in the explicit form

without imposing any additional restrictions on the size of spheres, distances between them,

and frequency range. These relations are expressed in terms of the unknown induced surface

forces distributed over the surfaces of the spheres. For the determination of the unknown

harmonics of the induced surface force densities, a closed inﬁnite system of linear algebraic

equations is given. On the basis of analysis of the quantities contained in this system, we

propose to seek its solution by the method of successive approximations using the system

of noninteracting spheres as a zero approximation and formulate a rule for determination of

the ﬂuid velocity and pressure ﬁelds as well as the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid

on spheres up to terms of b3 and a given power of the parameter σ.

In Sec. 3, in the approximation of noninteracting spheres, we obtain the ﬂuid velocity

and pressure induced by a system of spheres and analyze their behavior in the far zone. The

relations for harmonics of induced surface force densities obtained for the ﬁrst and second

5

iterations are given in Secs. 4 and 5, respectively. We derive the general relations for the

forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the spheres up to the terms of the order of b3 and

certain powers of the parameter σ corresponding to the second iteration. We analyze the

friction tensors in the particular cases: for suﬃciently large distances between the spheres

and in a low-frequency range. We show that the account of retardation eﬀects essentially

changes the character of hydrodynamic interactions between the spheres.

In Sec. 6, the general relations for the translational, rotational, and coupled mobilities

are derived up to the terms of the order b3 and σ2, σ4, and σ3, respectively. We estimate

contributions of three-sphere interactions to the mobility tensors and show the possibility of

coupling between translational and rotational motions of the same sphere. We investigate as

well the inﬂuence of nonstationarity on the behavior of the mobilities in the low-frequency

range and in the case of large distances between the spheres.

II. GENERAL RELATIONS

We consider N homogeneous macroscopic spheres of radii aα and masses mα, where

α = 1, 2, . . . , N, immersed in an unbounded incompressible viscous ﬂuid at rest at inﬁnity

in an external force ﬁeld and determine the ﬂuid velocity and pressure induced by these

spheres as well as the forces and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the spheres.

In the linear approximation, the ﬂuid is described by the linearized Navier–Stokes equa-

acting on a unit volume of the ﬂuid. In the present paper, for simplicity, we consider the

case of a conservative external force ﬁeld, i.e.,

The position of the center of sphere α at the time t is deﬁned by the radius vector

Rα(t) relative to the ﬁxed Cartesian coordinate system with origin at the point O (in what

follows, the system O). In parallel with this ﬁxed system, we also introduce N local moving

Cartesian coordinate systems with origins Oα at the centers of spheres coinciding with their

centers of mass (in what follows, systems Oα) so that sphere α does not move relative to

system Oα. Therefore, the radius vector r of any point of the space can be represented in

the form r = Rα + rα, where rα is the radius vector of this point relative to the local system

Oα. The motion of the spheres is described by the equations

Relations (2.29), (2.31)–(2.33), (2.36), (2.37), (2.40), (2.41), (2.43), and (2.44) completely

determine the function ˜v(r, ω) in the entire space provided that the induced surface force

densities are known. Analogously, relations (2.30), (2.34), (2.38), (2.42), and (2.45) uniquely

reproduce the original function ˜p(r, ω) at any point of the space with the exception of

the points of the surfaces of the spheres (rα = aα, α = 1, 2, . . . , N) where the obtained

quantity is equal to the half-sum of the original function ˜p(r, ω) given at r = Rα + aα + 0

14

and r = Rα + aα −
discontinuous at the surfaces rα = aα. The ﬂuid pressure at the surfaces of the spheres

0 because the original function ˜p(r, ω) deﬁned by relation (2.13) is

denoted as p(Rα + aα + 0, ω) can be represented as follows:

p(Rα + aα + 0, ω) = p(0)(Rα + aα, ω) + pind(Rα + aα + 0, ω),

(2.63)

pind(Rα + aα + 0, ω) = 2pind(Rα + aα, ω)

and the quantities p(0)(Rα + aα, ω) and pind(Rα + aα, ω) are deﬁned by the corresponding

expressions for p(0)(r, ω) and pind(r, ω) given at r = Rα + aα derived above.

Using the expansion (2.46) together with Eqs. (2.23) and (2.24), one can represent the

Fourier transforms of the force F α(ω) and the torque T α(ω) exerted by the ﬂuid on sphere

α in terms of Fourier harmonics of the induced surface force density f α,lm(ω) as follows

Thus, both the ﬂuid velocity and pressure induced by the spheres as well as the forces

and torques exerted by the ﬂuid on the spheres are expressed in terms of the harmonics of

the induced surface force densities. Note that these expressions have been obtained without

imposing any additional restrictions on the size of spheres, distances between them, and the

frequency range. To determine these harmonics, using the stick boundary conditions for the

ﬂuid velocity at the surfaces of the spheres [8,13,14], the original problem is reduced to the

determination of the unknown quantities f β,lm(ω) from the following inﬁnite system of the

linear algebraic equations [39]:

For the solution of the system of equations (2.67), (2.77), we take into account relations

is the static hydrodynamic self-interaction tensor [35,39,42].

These estimates enable us to seek a solution of system (2.67), (2.77) by the method of

successive approximations using Eqs. (2.67), (2.77) with the zero right-hand sides as the

zero iteration, which corresponds to the absence of interactions between the spheres. This

is quite natural because the sum and the second term on the right-hand sides of Eqs. (2.67)

correspond to the harmonics of the ﬂuid velocities at the surface of sphere α induced by

the surface and volume force densities distributed, respectively, over the surface of sphere β

and inside its volume, whereas analogous quantities on the left-hand sides of these equations

correspond to the harmonics of the ﬂuid velocities at the surface of sphere α induced by the

20

surface and volume force densities distributed, respectively, over the surface of this sphere

and inside its volume. Analogous reasonings may be used for Eqs. (2.77).

Next, we represent the unknown harmonics f α,lm(ω) in the form

f α,lm(ω) =

f (n)

α,lm(ω),

∞

Xn=0

(2.92)

where f (n)

α,l1m1(ω) is a solution of system (2.67), (2.77) corresponding the nth iteration. As

is shown in what follows, these quantities can be represented in the form

α,lm(ω) = f (t,n)
f (n)

α,lm(ω) + f (r,n)

α,lm(ω) + δl,1 f (p,n)

α,1m(ω),

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(2.93)

where f (t,n)

α,lm(ω) and f (r,n)

α,lm(ω) are the components of the harmonic f (n)

α,lm(ω) associated, re-

spectively, with the translational motion of sphere α and its rotation and f (p,n)

α,lm(ω) is the

harmonic of the potential component of the induced surface force density. In what follows,

we show that the last quantity has no eﬀect on the ﬂuid velocity and the forces and torques

exerted by the ﬂuid on the spheres.

In the theory of hydrodynamic interactions between spheres, the main problem is to

derive the required quantities up to the terms of a given order in certain small parameters

(in the general nonstationary case, these are the sets of parameters σ and b). Using the

estimates (2.89), it can be shown that, for the nth iteration, the main terms of the power

expansions of the quantities f (t,n)

α,lm(ω) and f (r,n)

α,lm(ω) in σ are proportional to σl+n and σl+n+1,

respectively. This enables us to formulate the following procedure for determination of the

induced velocity and pressure of the ﬂuid (as well well the forces and torques exerted by the

ﬂuid on the spheres) up to terms proportional to σp, where p is a certain positive integer:

(i) to carry out p iterations;

to σp inclusive.

(ii) for each sth iteration, s

p, to keep only harmonics with l = 0, 1, . . . , p

s;

≤

−

(iii) for each keeping harmonic, to retain all terms of power series up to terms proportional

For the ﬂuid velocity and pressure, further simpliﬁcation of the approximate results is pos-

sible depending on the choice of a point of observation.

21

In the present paper, we restrict ourselves to the consideration of only the ﬁrst two

iterations. For this, it is suﬃcient to retain the terms of at most the second [for f (t)

α (ω)] and

the third [for f (r)

α (ω)] orders in σ, respectively.

Using Eqs. (2.8), (2.9), (2.21), (2.22), (2.27), (2.65), (2.66), (2.92), and (2.93), we repre-

In the approximation of noninteracting spheres (zero iteration), the inﬁnite system of

equations (2.67) is splitted into the collection of independent systems of equations for each

Note that, for each α, we still have the inﬁnite system of linear algebraic equations in the

unknown quantities f (0)

α,lm(ω) (instead of a collection of systems for each value of l in the

stationary case [39]).

The system (3.1) may be solved together with Eqs. (2.77), which are rewritten in the

Physically, the presence of the non-zero term on the right-hand side of this equation cor-

responds to the appearance of the potential component of the induced surface forces even

in the approximation of noninteracting spheres (at the expense of an account for the time

dependence of the problem).

In the general case of interacting spheres, the conditions of the absence of the potential

components of the induced surface forces have the form

Yα(ω) = 0,

α = 1, 2, . . . , N.

Substituting the time-dependent solution (3.5)–(3.7) into Eqs. (2.41), (2.42), (2.44), and

(aβ, ω), where

β

velocity.

These conclusions concerning the inﬂuence of the potential component of the induced

where ˜Iα = (2/5) ˜mαa2

α is the moment of inertia of a ﬂuid sphere of radius aα. Analogously

to the Boussinesq force (3.45), torque (3.48) exerted by the ﬂuid on a sphere depends on

the angular velocity of the sphere, its acceleration, and the history of rotation of the sphere.

Furthermore, the second term in (3.48) is independent of the ﬂuid viscosity.

Finally, using the relations (2.5), (2.6), (2.94), and (2.95), we can represent the equations

of motion of sphere α as follows:

Note that in relations (5.41), (5.43), (5.45), and (5.47), the terms proportional to

correspond to the three-particle interactions and, hence, they are absent in the particular

case of two spheres (α, β = 1, 2).

Note that the friction tensors for the ﬁrst and second iterations satisfy the symmetry

As was mentioned above, all required quantities (including the friction tensors) are ob-

tained without imposing any additional restrictions on the dimensional parameter yαβ. In

particular cases, the expressions for the friction tensors can be essentially simpliﬁed. We

consider the following two opposite modes: Re yαβ ≫

This mode is characterized by an exponentially small coupling between the translational

and rotational motions of the spheres proportional to exp(

yαβ) for β

= α as well as between

−

the rotational motions of diﬀerent spheres. Taking into account that in the stationary case,

αβ, ξrt
ξtr

αβ, and ξrr

αβ, for β

= α, are proportional to 1/R2

αβ and 1/R3

αβ, respectively, [29],

we may conclude that the retardation eﬀects lead to an essential decrease in hydrodynamic

interactions between the spheres. For the mutual translational friction tensors, this inﬂuence

is not so considerable because the behavior of ξtt

αβ as 1/Rαβ in the stationary case [4] is

replaced by 1/R3

αβ in the nonstationary case for large distances between the spheres.

The second mode,

1, corresponds to the low frequency domain. In this case,

According to (5.70)–(5.73), in the low-frequency range, the main frequency-dependent

components of the friction tensors are proportional to ω1/2. For the rotational and coupled

In [31], the frequency-dependent mobility tensors are derived up to the terms of the third

order in two parameters b and σ, i.e. up to the terms of bnσm, where n + m = 3 (”n + m = 3

approximation”). According to one of the main conclusions in [31], the frequency-dependent

mobility tensors determined in this approximation contain only the terms corresponding to

the two-particle interactions, which is similar to the behavior of the frequency-independent

mobility tensors determined up to the terms σ3 ( or σ4 for µrr

αβ) [4,29]. Moreover, the diagonal

(β = α) translational and rotational mobility tensors determined in [31] are independent of

the hydrodynamic interactions between the spheres, i.e.,

µtt

αα(ω) = µt

α(ω)I,

µrr

αα(ω) = µr

α(ω)I,

(6.16)

and, hence, the self-interaction of a sphere due the action of the ﬂuid induced by this sphere

and reﬂected from the rest spheres is not described within the framework of approximation

n + m = 3. Furthermore, there is no coupling between translational and rotational motions

of the same sphere, i.e.,

µtr

αα(ω) = 0,

µrt

αα(ω) = 0.

(6.17)

Unlike [31], expressions (6.3)–(6.10) represented in the form of expansions in the param-

eters b and σ contain the terms up to b3σm, where m = 2 for µtt

αβ(ω), m = 3 for µtr

αβ(ω)

and µrt

αβ(ω), and m = 4 for µrr

αβ(ω), i.e., n + m > 3. An account of such terms in the

mobility tensors leads to some new eﬀects, caused by the contribution of the three-particle

hydrodynamic interactions to the mobility tensors. This contribution is described by the

terms proportional to the sum

in Eqs. (6.4), (6.6), (6.8), and (6.10). It follows that the

γ6=α,β
P

main terms corresponding to the three-particle hydrodynamic interactions are proportional

to b2σ2 for µtt

αβ(ω), b2σ4 for µrr

αβ(ω), and b2σ/R2

αβ for µtr

αβ(ω) and µrt

αβ(ω). In addition, the

terms proportional to

in the diagonal mobility tensors µtt

αα(ω) and µrr

αα(ω) deﬁned by

relations (6.3) and (6.5) describe the self-interaction of sphere α due to the action of the

γ6=α
P

ﬂuid induced by this sphere and reﬂected from the rest ones. This eﬀect is of the order of

b2σ2 for µtt

αα(ω) and b2σ4 µrr

αα(ω). According to Eqs. (6.7) and (6.9) for the mobility tensors

µtr

αα(ω) and µrt

αα(ω), there is a coupling between translational and rotational motions of the

same sphere, which is of the order of b2σ/R2

αγ.

Now, let us examine the mobility tensors deﬁned by Eqs. (6.3)–(6.10) in the approxima-

tion n + m = 3. We see that the relations for µtt

αα(ω), µrr

αα(ω) and µtr

αβ(ω), µrt

αβ(ω), where

44

α, β = 1, 2, . . . , N, coincide with the corresponding relations given in [31]. For the rotational

mobility tensors µrr

αβ(ω), where β

= α, we get

The frequency-dependent component M tt

αβ(ω) of the translational mobility tensor co-

incides with the corresponding result given in [31].

In [31], the mobility tensors in the

low-frequency range are calculated to the ﬁrst order in the parameters b and σ, and, within

the framework of this approximation, for β

= α,

µrt

αβ(ω) = 0,

µtr

αβ(ω) = 0,

α, β = 1, 2, . . . , N,

(6.42)

As is seen from relations (6.39)–(6.41) derived in the present paper within the framework

of the approximation discussed above, the mobility tensors µrr

αβ(ω), µtr

αβ(ω), and µrt

αβ(ω) for

α, β = 1, 2, . . . , N, are not equal to zero but proportional to ω in the low-frequency range.

VII. CONCLUSION

In the present paper, we calculate the distributions of the velocity and pressure ﬁelds in

an unbounded incompressible viscous ﬂuid induced in the nonstationary case by an arbitrary

number of spheres moving and rotating in it as well as the time-dependent forces and torques

exerted by the ﬂuid on the spheres. All the quantities of interest are expressed in terms of

the induced surface force densities without imposing any additional restrictions on the size

of spheres, distances between them, and frequency range. Within the framework of this

approach, we derived the general relations for the translational, rotational, and coupled

friction and mobility tensors in the case of an arbitrary number of spheres up to the terms

of the order b3 and σ2, σ4, and σ3, respectively, and analyzed the contributions to the

mobility tensors caused by the eﬀects of the three-particle hydrodynamic interactions and

the self-interaction of spheres. We investigated as well the inﬂuence of retardation eﬀects

APPENDIX B: ON THE VALIDITY OF SOLUTIONS OF THE LINEARIZED

NAVIER–STOKES EQUATION

All relations obtained in the present paper are true within the framework of the linearized

Navier–Stokes equation. Using the explicit form for the velocity and pressure ﬁelds of

the ﬂuid induced by a single sphere or a system of noninteracting spheres, we consider

several problems of the correctness of the linearization of the Navier–Stokes equation in the

nonstationary case. The Fourier transform of the linearized Navier–Stokes equation (2.1)

has the form

∇p(r, ω)

(iωρ + η

)v(r, ω) =

ρ∇ϕ(r, ω),

where

is the Laplace operator. The linearized equation (B1) is valid [8,11–15] provided

△

that the force acting on a unit volume of the ﬂuid due to the ﬂuid viscosity

F vis(r, t) = η

v(r, t)

△

is much greater than the nonlinear (inertial) term

To estimate the possibility to neglect the nonlinear term, we use the following condition:

where the bar in (B4) means averaging over a certain time interval.

Since in the approximation of noninteracting spheres, the rotation of spheres does not

make a contribution to the ﬂuid pressure [relation (3.21)], we rewrite Eq. (B1) in terms of

the notation used in the present paper as follows:

∇p(t,0)ind(r, ω)

are the viscous forces due to the translational motion of the spheres and their rotation,

respectively. As is seen from relation (B11), the nonstationarity of the problem leads to the

appearance of the component of the viscous force induced by rotation of spheres.

First, we consider the case of a single sphere α. To verify condition (B4), the general

relations for the ﬂuid velocities v(t,0)ind(r, ω) and v(r,0)ind(r, ω) in the entire frequency range

are necessary instead of particular relations (3.29) and (3.25). To this end, we use the well-

known results for the ﬂuid velocity induced by a single sphere moving with arbitrary velocity

Substituting (B12) and (B13), respectively, into (B10) and (B11), after certain trans-

formations, we obtain the following relations for the Fourier transforms of the translational

and rotational components of the viscous force:

which are valid for any rα ≥

It should be noted that the ﬁrst term in (B12), being the main term of the ﬂuid velocity

induced by the moving sphere for distances Re xα ≫
force. As a result, the quantity F vis(t)(r, ω) exponentially decreases in this range despite

1, gives no contribution to the viscous

the fact that v(t,0)ind(r, ω) is proportional to 1/r3
α.

Lets us investigate the validity of solutions (B12) and (B13) of the linear Navier–Stokes

equation in two particular cases corresponding to a sphere oscillating in a ﬂuid with trans-

lational U α(t) = U α cos ωt or rotational Ωα(t) = Ωα cos ωt velocities, where the frequency

of oscillations ω is such that

from the sphere: Re xα ≫

Substituting the ﬂuid velocities deﬁned by relations (3.29) and (3.30) for Re xα ≫

is true for a sphere rotating with oscillating angular velocity for any distances rα (except

55

for the particular case where rα k
nonlinear force are equal to zero), whereas, for a sphere oscillating with translational velocity,

Since Re xα ≫

1, inequality (B19) is not valid for any rα in this domain. Therefore,

expression (3.29) for the ﬂuid velocity induced by an oscillating sphere far from it obtained

within the framework of the linear approximation cannot be regarded as correct in this space

domain for the problem considered because, in the general case, the nonlinear term is much

greater than the viscous force.

Using the results obtained above, we can make analogous conclusions for a system of

oscillating spheres in the approximation of noninteracting particles. In particular, the ﬂuid

velocity and pressure induced in the far zone by spheres oscillating with velocities U β(t) =

U β cos ωt, where β = 1, 2, . . . , N, should be determined using the nonlinear Navier–Stokes

equation because the linear solutions deﬁned by relations (3.33) and (3.34) contradict the

required condition (B4) of linearization of the Navier–Stokes equation at any point in this

domain.

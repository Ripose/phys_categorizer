Abstract

We present numerical simulations of vortices that appear via primary bifurcations out of the

unstructured circular Couette ﬂow in the Taylor-Couette system with counter-rotating as well as

with co-rotating cylinders. The full, time dependent Navier-Stokes equations are solved with a

combination of a ﬁnite diﬀerence and a Galerkin method for a ﬁxed axial periodicity length of the

vortex patterns and for a ﬁnite system of aspect ratio 12 with rigid nonrotating ends in a setup

with radius ratio η = 0.5. Diﬀerences in structure, dynamics, symmetry properties, bifurcation and

stability behavior between spiral vortices with azimuthal wave numbers M = ±1 and M = 0 Taylor

vortices are elucidated and compared in quantitative detail. Simulations in axially periodic systems

and in ﬁnite systems with stationary rigid ends are compared with experimental spiral data. In a

second part of the paper we determine how the above listed properties of the M = −1, 0, 1 vortex

structures are changed by an externally imposed axial through-ﬂow with Reynolds numbers in the

range −40 ≤ Re ≤ 40. Among others we investigate when left handed or right handed spirals or

toroidally closed vortices are preferred.

INTRODUCTION

2

Spiral vortices appearing in the annular gap between the concentric rotating cylinders of

the Taylor-Couette system [1] are a rather interesting example for the spontaneous formation

of a helicoidal structure out of a homogeneous state of a nonlinear forced system when the

forcing exceeds a critical threshold. Like the competing toroidally closed Taylor vortices the

spiral vortex structures bifurcate out of the unstructured basic state of circular Couette ﬂow

(CCF) that is stable at small rotation rates of the inner cylinder. The spiral pattern breaks

the rotational symmetry of the annular gap. It oscillates in time by rotating azimuthally as

a whole thereby propagating axially. The Taylor vortex ﬂow (TVF), on the other hand is

rotationally symmetric and stationary.

The spiral pattern is eﬀectively one dimensional (like TVF) and stationary when seen

from a co-moving frame [2]: the spiral ﬁelds do not depend on time t, axial coordinate z,

and azimuthal angle ϕ separately but only via the combined phase variable φ = kz + Mϕ −

ω(k, M)t. Here k and M are the axial and azimuthal wave numbers, respectively, and ω the

frequency. In the ϕ − z plane of an ’unrolled’ cylindrical surface the lines of constant phase,

φ = φ0, are straight with slope −M/k as shown in Fig. 1. An azimuthal wave number M > 0

implies a left handed spiral (L-SPI) while M < 0 refer to right handed spirals (R-SPI) with

our convention of taking k to be positive. L-SPI and R-SPI being mirror images of each

other under the operation z → −z are symmetry degenerate ﬂow states. Which of them is

realized in a particular experimental or numerical setup depends on the initial conditions.

With the lines of constant phase in the ϕ − z plane being oriented for both spiral types

obliquely to the azimuthal ’wind’ of the basic CCF both spirals are advectively rotated by

the latter like rigid objects. Their common angular velocity is ˙ϕSP I = ω(k, M)/M. This

advection enforced rigid-body rotation of the spiral vortices is also reﬂected by the fact

that the axial phase velocities wph = ω/k = ˙ϕSP IM/k of an L-SPI (M > 0) and of an

R-SPI (M < 0) are opposite to each other, see Fig. 1. By the same token the rotationally

symmetric (M = 0) structure of toroidally closed Taylor vortices is stationary (ω = 0): the

lines of constant phases being parallel to the azimuthal CCF the latter cannot advect these

vortices. However, an externally imposed axial through-ﬂow can advect Taylor vortices as

well as spiral vortices.

The external through-ﬂow breaks the mirror symmetry between L-SPI and R-SPI. It

November 21, 2013

changes their rotation and propagation dynamics as well as their structural properties and

their bifurcation behavior in diﬀerent ways. This is the topic of our investigation.

In his review [1] Tagg remarks that systematic investigation of non-axisymmetric vortex

states that appear via primary bifurcations out of the CCF state started remarkably late

in the history of the Taylor-Couette problem. Krueger et al. [3] predicted in 1966 primary

transitions to non-axisymmetric rotating-wave ﬂow which then were observed in experiments

by Snyder [4] who had presented experimental evidence for diﬀerent types of stable helical

ﬂow (referred to as ’spirals’) a few years earlier.

In 1985, an experimental survey was

published by Andereck et al.

[5] which classiﬁed a large variety of diﬀerent ﬂow states,

including some spiral types like linear, modulated, interpenetrating, and wavy spirals etc.

An extensive numerical linear stability analysis was then performed for a wide range of

radius ratios by Langford et al.

[6]. At this time, Tagg et al.

[7] experimentally observed

a transition from CCF to axially standing and azimuthally traveling waves (ribbons) and

found numerically calculated wave speeds to be in agreement with experimental results.

Edwards [8] studied the transition from CCF to traveling waves. More recent experiments

were done with a system of radius ratio η = 0.5 [9]. Spiral solutions in a relatively narrow gap

with axially periodic boundary conditions were obtained numerically with a pseudo-spectral

method using co-rotating helicoidal coordinates which were adapted to the expected spiral

[10].

Various eﬀects of an externally imposed axial through-ﬂow in the Taylor-Couette system

have been explored since the early 1930 so that the list of publications cannot be discussed

here – see, e.g, Ref. [11] for a partial and far from complete compilation. We mention here in

addition a few, more recent papers on selected topics beyond those listed in Ref. [11]: linear

analysis of the competition between shear and centrifugal instability mechanisms [12, 13];

linear SPI and TVF fronts and pulses [14]; weakly nonlinear bifurcation analysis of axially

extended spiral, ribbon, and mixed vortex states with homogeneous amplitudes [2, 15]; the-

oretical/numerical investigation of the nonlinear pattern selection in the absolutely unstable

regime under downstream evolving intensity envelopes [11]; theoretical/numerical analysis

of noise-sustained patterns in the convectively unstable regime [16] (related experiments are

listed in [11]); analysis of the changes in the noise sensitivity across the convective-absolute

stability boundary [17]; measurements of velocity ﬁelds by particle image velocimetry [18].

In this work we explore in a detailed quantitative investigation the spatio-temporal struc-

November 21, 2013

tures as well as the bifurcation properties of spirals and TVF in a setup with co- and counter-

rotating cylinders of ﬁxed radius ratio η = 0.5 with and without an externally imposed axial

through-ﬂow. Most calculations were done for axially periodic boundary conditions that im-

pose the wave length of the vortex pattern. However also a few simulations of ﬁnite systems

with rigid, non-rotating lids were done to compare with experiments and to study the eﬀect

of phase propagation suppressing boundaries. The calculations were done with a time de-

pendent ﬁnite diﬀerences method in the r − z plane combined with a spectral decomposition

in ϕ which yields by construction only the stable ﬂows. However, by selectively suppress-

ing destabilizing modes we also were able to trace out the unstable TVF and SPI solution

branches. We do not include in this work results on ribbons [7], i.e., nonlinear combinations

of L and R spirals [2] since they were unstable for the parameters investigated here.

In Sec. II we present the notation for describing the Taylor Couette system and we

describe our numerical method.

In Sec. III we review the spatio-temporal properties of

TVF and SPI and we present results on their bifurcation behavior and ﬂow structure in the

absence of through-ﬂow. In particular we provide detailed comparisons of the bifurcation

and structural properties of these primary vortex states. Also comparisons with experiments

are presented and discussed. In Sec. IV we elucidate the eﬀect of an external through-ﬂow

on structure, dynamics, and bifurcation properties of TVF and SPI for counter-rotating

cylinders and stationary outer cylinder. The last section contains a summary of the main

results.

II. SYSTEM

recently [9].

A. Theoretical description

We report results obtained numerically for a Taylor-Couette system with co- and counter-

rotating cylinders. The ratio η = r1/r2 of the radii r1 and r2 of the inner and outer cylinders,

respectively, was ﬁxed at the value η = 0.5 for which also experiments have been made

We consider the ﬂuid in the annulus between the cylinders to be isothermal and incom-

pressible with kinematic viscosity ν. The gap width d = r2 − r1 is used as the unit of

November 21, 2013

5

length and the momentum diﬀusion time d2/ν radially across the gap as the time unit so

that velocities are reduced by ν/d. To characterize the driving of the system, we use the

Reynolds numbers

R1 = r1Ω1d/ν ; R2 = r2Ω2d/ν .

(2.1)

They are just the reduced azimuthal velocities of the ﬂuid at the inner and outer cylinder,

respectively, where Ω1 and Ω2 are the respective angular velocities of the cylinders. The

inner one is always rotating counterclockwise so that Ω1 and R1 are positive. We explore

positive as well as negative values of R2 corresponding to co- as well as counter rotation

of the cylinders, respectively. And we elucidate the eﬀect of an externally imposed axial

through-ﬂow.

Within the above described scaling, the NSE take the form

∂tu = ∇2u − (u · ∇)u − ∇p .

Here p denotes the pressure reduced by ρν2/d2 and ρ is the mass density of the ﬂuid. Using

cylindrical coordinates, the velocity ﬁeld

(2.2)

(2.3)

u = u er + v eϕ + w ez

is decomposed into a radial component u, an azimuthal one v, and an axial one w.

We have solved the resulting equations subject to no slip conditions at the cylinders. In

Sec. III D we present simulations of systems with axial size Γ = 12 and rigid stationary

ends bounding the annulus axially in order to compare with experiments [9]. For the main

part (c.f. Secs. III and IV) of this work we imposed, however, axially periodic boundary

conditions at z = 0 and z = Γ = 1.6. So the axial wavelength of the TVF and the SPI

patterns investigated there is λ = 1.6 and the wave number is k = 2π/λ = 3.927.

B. Numerical method

The calculations were done with a ﬁnite diﬀerences method in the r − z plane combined

with a spectral decomposition in ϕ. Since we have been studying also ﬁnite length cylinders,

say, with lids bounding the annulus vertically, we do not use here a spectral decomposition in

axial direction which for axially periodic systems is a generic alternative. The discretization

November 21, 2013

6

(a FTCS - Forward Time, Centered Space algorithm) has been done on staggered grids in

the r − z plane following the procedure of Ref.

[19]. It yields simple expressions for the

derivatives, it does not require boundary conditions for the pressure, and it avoids diﬃculties

with boundary conditions for more than one velocity ﬁeld component at the same position.

We used homogeneous grids with discretization lengths ∆r = ∆z = 0.05 which have showed

to be more accurate than non-homogeneous grids. Time steps were ∆t < 1/3600.

Azimuthally all ﬁelds f = u, v, w, p were expanded as

f (r, ϕ, z, t) =

fm(r, z, t) eimϕ.

(2.4)

mmax

Xm=−mmax

For the ﬂows investigated here a truncation of the above Fourier expansion at mmax = 8

was suﬃcient to properly resolve the anharmonicities in the ﬁelds. The system of coupled

equations for the amplitudes fm(r, z, t) of the azimuthal normal modes −mmax ≤ m ≤ mmax

is solved with the FTCS algorithm. Pressure and velocity ﬁelds are iteratively adjusted to

each other with the method of ’artiﬁcial compressibility’ [20]

dp(n) = −β ∇ · u(n)

(0 < β < 1)

p(n+1) = p(n) + dp(n)

u(n+1) = u(n) − ∆t ∇(dp(n)) .

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

The pressure correction dp(n) in the n-th iteration step being proportional to the divergence

of u(n) is used to adapt the velocity ﬁeld u(n+1). The iteration loop (2.5-2.7) is executed for
each azimuthal Fourier mode separately. It is iterated until ∇ · u has become suﬃciently

small for each m mode considered – the magnitude of the total divergence never exceeded

0.02 and typically it was much smaller. After that the next FTCS time step was executed.

For code validation we compared SPI solutions with experiments [9] and TVF solutions

with previous numerical simulations [11] and close to onset also with Ginzburg-Landau

results [21]. Furthermore, we compared bifurcation thresholds of the nonlinear SPI and TVF

solutions with the respective stability boundaries of the linearized NSE [6, 14] obtained by

a shooting method that is described in detail in [14]. As expected from our experience with

primary vortex structures in the Taylor-Couette and Rayleigh-Benard problem lie the MAC

FTCS bifurcation thresholds for our discretization typically 1 - 2 % below the respective

linear stability thresholds. This deviation signiﬁcantly reduces for ﬁner discretizations. We

also investigated how the nonlinear solutions change when varying mmax and/or the grid

November 21, 2013

7

spacing. From these analyses we conservatively conclude that typical SPI frequencies have

an error of less than about 0.2% and that typical velocity ﬁeld amplitudes can be oﬀ by

about 3 - 4%. Time steps were always well below the von Neumann stability criterion and

by more than a factor of three below the Courant-Friederichs-Lewy criterion.

In order to trace out the unstable parts of bifurcation branches of TVF and SPI solutions

we applied diﬀerent stabilization methods that are described in Sec. III B 1.

III. SPIRAL VORTICES AND TAYLOR VORTICES

In this section we ﬁrst brieﬂy review spatio-temporal properties of spiral vortices (M 6= 0)

and Taylor vortices (M = 0) in the absence of any externally enforced axial through-ﬂow.

Here M is the azimuthal wave number of the respective vortex structure. Then we present

our results on the bifurcation behavior of M = 0 and M = ±1 vortex solutions and on their

ﬂow structure.

They both grow out of the basic CCF state, uCCF = vCCF (r)eϕ, that is rotationally

symmetric, axially homogeneous, and time translationally invariant. Here in our system

with η = 1/2 the radial proﬁle of its azimuthal velocity reads

A. Spatio-temporal structure

The spiral vortex structure is periodic in ϕ, z, and t.

It rotates uniformly as a whole

like a rigid object in azimuthal direction thereby translating with constant phase velocity in

axial direction — the spiral ﬁelds f (r, ϕ, z, t) do not depend on ϕ, z, t separately but only

the phase combination

φ = kz + Mϕ − ω(k, M)t .

(3.2)

Here k is the axial wave number that we always take to be positive and ω(k, M) is the fre-

quency. Thus, with f (r, ϕ, z, t) = F (r, φ), the spiral pattern is one dimensional. Comparing

the Fourier decompositions

f (r, ϕ, z, t) =

Thus only the mode combinations m = nM appear in a SPI with azimuthal wave number

Thus, on the ϕ − z plane of such an ’unrolled’ cylindrical surface these lines of constant

phase are straight with slope −M/k. And an azimuthal wave number M > 0 implies a left

handed spiral (L-SPI) while M < 0 refer to right handed spirals (R-SPI) with our convention

of taking k to be positive. L-SPI and R-SPI being mirror images of each other under the

operation z → −z are symmetry degenerate ﬂow states. Which of them is realized in a

particular experimental or numerical setup depends on the initial conditions.

The lines of constant phase and with it the whole spiral structure rotates in ϕ with

angular velocity

.

Its direction strongly depends on the inner cylinder’s rotation due to the inﬂuence of the

CCF. The latter decisively determines the shape of the linear spiral eigenmodes that can

grow beyond the stability boundary of the CCF state against perturbations with azimuthal

wave number M 6= 0. In the parameter range explored here the spirals rotate into the same

direction as the inner cylinder, i.e., into positive ϕ-direction so that ω(k, M)/M is always

positive, i.e., ω = sign(M)|ω|. From this rigid rotation one immediately infers from Eq.(3.2)

that the axial phase velocity

wph =

of an L-SPI (M > 0) is positive and of an R-SPI (M < 0) it is negative.

For the rotationally symmetric (M = 0) structure of toroidally closed Taylor vortices

the lines of constant phases are parallel to eϕ. This M = 0 pattern is stationary (ω = 0).

The main reason is that the azimuthal ﬂow of the basic CCF state being precisely parallel

to the vortex lines of constant phase cannot advect them. However, an axial mean ﬂow,

being perpendicular to them can advect them: an externally enforced axial through-ﬂow

November 21, 2013

9

of strength Re causes a non-zero axial phase velocity of the Taylor vortex pattern that

grows linearly with Re, at least when phase pinning eﬀects are absent as for axially periodic

boundary conditions.

B. Bifurcation behavior

In the parameter regime considered here the bifurcation thresholds for nonlinear SPI and

TVF solutions, i.e., the linear stability boundaries of the CCF state against M = ±1 and

M = 0 vortex perturbations [6] diﬀer only slightly from each other. For our ﬁxed wave

number of k = 3.927 they intersect at (Rs

1 = 95.25, Rs

2 = −73.69) where these two diﬀerent

vortex modes are bi-”critical” in the sense that their growth rates are simultaneously zero.

The stability boundaries were obtained with a shooting method from the linearized NSE. The

nonlinear SPI and TVF solutions that were determined with the numerical method described

in Sec. II B give bifurcation thresholds that diﬀer as a result of the FTCS discretization

errors by at most 2% from the linear stability analysis. However, this diﬀerence can grow

with externally applied through-ﬂow up to, say, 5% at Re ≃ 40 (c.f. Sec. IV) when the

discretization is not reﬁned.

1. Radial ﬂow amplitudes of TVF and SPI

The bifurcation of both, TVF and SPI solutions is forward as shown by the bifurcation

surface over the R1 −R2 plane of Fig. 2. There the respective vortex solution is characterized

by the primary Fourier amplitude, |um,n|, of the radial ﬂow intensity at mid gap, r = r1 +0.5,

taken as order parameter with m denoting the azimuthal mode index and n referring to the

axial one, respectively. Thus, Fig. 2 shows |u0,1| for the TVF solution by thin lines and

|u1,1| = |u−1,1| for the two symmetry degenerate M = ±1 SPI solutions by thick lines,

respectively. In each case stable (unstable) solutions are represented by full (dashed) lines.

The diﬀerent stability regions labelled A - E are explained in the caption of Fig. 2.

The stability of the vortex states refers to our system with ﬁxed axial periodicity length.

Thus, e.g., Eckhaus or Benjamin-Feir instabilities [22] that can destabilize periodic patterns

in inﬁnite and large systems do not occur here. Furthermore, our periodic boundary con-

ditions allowing free phase propagation enhance the existence range as well as the stability

November 21, 2013

10

range of SPI solutions in comparison with, say, Ekman vortex generating stationary lids

that axially close the annulus in an experimental setup. The latter suppress phase propa-

gation in their vicinity so that phase generating and phase destroying defects near opposite

boundaries are necessary for the realization of spirals in the bulk of such systems.

In our setup TVF is for R2 > Rs

2 stable close to onset. And it remains so at least up to

the largest value of R1 = 130 shown in Fig. 2 – for larger R1 TVF eventually undergoes an
oscillatory instability. For more negative R2 < Rs

2 TVF is unstable at onset (region C in
Fig. 2) but becomes stable at larger R1 in region E. The unstable TVF solution branch in

region C was obtained by suppressing any m 6= 0 modes in the ﬁeld representation (2.4), i.e.,

by allowing only rotationally symmetric solutions. Lifting this mode restriction inﬁnitesimal

m 6= 0 perturbations drive the system in the parameter region C of Fig. 2 away from the

unstable TVF solution into a stable SPI state.

Spirals, on the other hand, are for R2 < Rs

2 stable close to onset and remain so at least

up to the largest value of R1 = 130 shown in Fig. 2 while for R2 > Rs

2 they are unstable

at onset (region D in Fig. 2). But then they become stable at larger R1 in region E. The

unstable SPI solution branch in region D was obtained by suppressing m = 0 contributions

to the radial velocity ﬁeld u at mid gap location. This stabilized the SPI solution against

the growth of TVF. Lifting this restriction of the available mode space the unstable SPI

solutions in region D decay into stable Taylor vortices.

In the relatively large region E both, SPI as well as TVF solutions coexist bistably and

the ﬁnal vortex structure to be found here depends on the initial conditions and the driving

history of R1, R2. Note in particular that for our periodic boundary conditions the region E

with stable spirals extends to positive R2, i.e., to a situation with co-rotating cylinders.

2. SPI frequencies

In Fig. 3 the spiral frequencies ω are plotted over the same control parameter range as

the radial ﬂow amplitudes in Fig. 2. Also here we include – for the sake of comparison

with Fig. 2 – the identiﬁcation of the diﬀerent stability regions of TVF and SPI solution by

the symbols A-E explained in the caption of Fig. 2. At onset ω agrees within the numerical

accuracy of our nonlinear code with the eigenvalue resulting from the linear stability analysis

of the CCF state.

November 21, 2013

11

The nonlinear SPI frequencies further away from onset vary smoothly: the bifurcation

surface of ω in Fig. 3 has the shape of a cloth that hangs down from a frame given by the

linear onset spiral frequencies ω(R1,stab) at the stability threshold R1,stab(R2) of CCF. The

location of minimal ω on the bifurcation surface is shown by a thick line in Fig. 3. Thus,

the nonlinear SPI frequencies are typically smaller than the linear ones but do not deviate

substantially from them.

Since the linear onset frequencies show a characteristic variation along the bifurcation

threshold, R1,stab(R2), that dictates the form of the whole ω bifurcation surface we discuss

them in some detail. They, furthermore allow for a simple, yet semiquantitive explanation

of the phenomenon of rigid body rotation of spirals in terms of a passive advection dynamics

of M = ±1 vortex perturbations, eiφ, with lines of constant phase, φ = kz + Mϕ − ωt, that

are oriented obliquely to the ”wind” of the basic azimuthal CCF. To that end we compare in

Fig. 4 the onset spiral frequency ω(R1,stab) at the stability threshold R1,stab(R2) of CCF with
the ”model” frequency ωmodel(R1,stab) which is evaluated also at the stability threshold
R1,stab(R2). Here

ωmodel = hωCCF (r)i =

(3.7)

is the mean of the rotation rate of the CCF, ωCCF = vCCF /r. For R2 < 0 the averaging is

done over the radial domain between inner cylinder, r1, and the ﬁrst zero, r0, of vCCF (r)

(3.1). Thus, at the stability threshold R1,stab(R2) one has

r2
0 =

2R2 − 4R1,stab
2R2 − R1,stab

(3.8)

when R2 < 0. However, when R2 ≥ 0, i.e., when vCCF remains positive throughout the

gap r0 is replaced by r2. The restriction of the radial average to the range between r1 and

r0 is motivated by an argument of largely hand-waving nature: the linear eigenfunctions

for marginally stable SPI modes are somewhat centered to this range where the growth of

vortex perturbations is supported.

Fig. 4 shows that the onset spiral frequency ω(R1,stab) agrees perfectly well with the mean

CCF rotation frequency (3.7) when R2 > 0. For R2 < 0 the model ansatz (3.7) for the global

spiral rotation rate overestimates slightly the spiral frequency since Eq.(3.7) does not contain

contributions from negative CCF rotation rates between r0 and r2. In fact, if one extends

November 21, 2013

12

in an ad hoc way the averaging domain slightly beyond r0 then the agreement improves

signiﬁcantly. Thus, the onset spiral frequency ω(R1,stab), i.e., the frequency eigenvalue can

be seen as the mean rotation rate of the CCF – albeit weighted appropriately by the critical

eigenfunctions.

C. Flow structure of TVF and SPI

In this section we elucidate the ﬂow structure of spiral vortices in comparison with Taylor

vortices. To that end we consider the radial velocity ﬁeld. In Fig. 5 we show the axial proﬁles

of u(z) at mid gap position for R1 = 130 being ﬁxed and various R2 that cover the whole

interval between the bifurcation thresholds, c.f. Fig. 2 and the inset of Fig. 5. Full (dashed)

lines refer to negative (positive) R2. In each case the axial position of maximal radial outﬂow

is chosen to lie at z = 0.5λ. For the sake of better visibility two axial periods of the vortex

proﬁles are shown.

1. Anharmonicity: TVF versus SPI

Typically SPI are less anharmonic than TVF. Also the proﬁles of both are less anharmonic

for positive R2 than for negative R2 and the degree of anharmonicity increases when R2

becomes more negative. For the mirror symmetric TVF this anharmonicity growth comes

from a widening (narrowing) of the axial range ∆in (∆out) of radial inﬂow over which u < 0

(u > 0) and the corresponding decrease (increase) of the inﬂow (outﬂow) velocity. For the

L-SPI that propagate in Fig. 5 into positive z-direction the anharmonicity grows mainly by

ﬂattening (steepening) of the wave proﬁles ahead of (behind) the crests. However, ∆in/∆out

increases also for SPI albeit less than for TVF.

The variation of the anharmonicity of the vortex proﬁles can be read oﬀ more quantita-

tively from the results of an axial Fourier analysis. To that end we show in Fig. 6 the ratios

|un/u1| of the n-th and ﬁrst axial Fourier modes of the proﬁles of Fig. 5 as a function of R2

for ﬁxed R1. With growing distances from the bifurcation thresholds at positive and nega-

tive R2 the anharmonicity grows for TVF as well as for SPI. It does so most precipitously

near the thresholds at negative R2 of about -150 in Fig. 6.

At negative R2 the anharmonicity of TVF can be for rapidly counter rotating cylinders

November 21, 2013

13

already close to threshold so large that |u2/u1| > 1. This property reﬂects the fact that for

suﬃciently negative R2 Taylor vortices are eﬀectively smaller in size than the gap width.

There are two main reasons for this size reduction which are both connected to the tendency

of vortices to have circular shape: (i) the axial periodicity length λ = 1.6 reduces the axial

vortex size relative to the gap and, more importantly, (ii) the TVF intensity is radially

restricted not to extend signiﬁcantly beyond the zero of CCF at r0 since according to the

Rayleigh criterion m = 0 radial momentum transport is suppressed by opposite pressure

gradients for r > r0 where the CCF stratiﬁcation of the squared angular momentum density

is stable. With R2 becoming more negative r0 moves inwards and the radial size of Taylor

vortices reduce.

However, the m = 0 Rayleigh criterion does not apply to SPI. Their m 6= 0 radial

momentum transport extends further beyond r0. Therefore SPI vortices ﬁll out the whole

gap more than Taylor vortices, c.f. Fig. 7, and consequently they are less anharmonic.

2. Mirror symmetry breaking of SPI

TVF shows axial mirror symmetry around the position of maximal radial outﬂow, z =

0.5λ, in Fig. 5. In order to measure the degree to which this symmetry is broken in SPI we

have used the asymmetry parameter

|u(z′) − u(−z′)| dz′
|u(z′) + u(−z′)| dz′

P =

R
R

(3.9)

evaluated at mid gap with z′ = 0 locating the largest radial SPI outﬂow at this r-value. In

this way we found, e.g., for the spirals of Fig. 5 that the smallest P ≃ 0.2 occurs for spirals

with the smallest frequency ωmin ≃ 23.4 at R2 ≃ −74. Increasing R2 from this value all the

way toward the upper SPI bifurcation threshold at R2 ≃ 48 the frequency increases but P

remains roughly unchanged at about 0.2. On the other hand, when decreasing R2 from -74

the asymmetry parameter increases with increasing ω up to P ≃ 1 close to the lower SPI

bifurcation threshold R2 ≃ −158. Thus, fast propagating spirals at large negative R2 show

the largest mirror symmetry breaking.

D. Comparison with experimental results

In order to check our numerical results we made a few comparisons with experiments. For

example, in Fig. 8 we show the axial proﬁle of the radial ﬂow u(z) of an L-SPI at r1 + 0.4.

Symbols denote Laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements [9] and the full line a numerical

simulation, both done in a setup of height Γ = 12 with rigid, non-rotating lids at both ends

of the annulus. In each case the spirals were monitored at mid-height of the cylinders where

they had the common wavelength λ ≃ 1.76. Since absolute experimental velocities were not

available we have scaled the experimental maximum in Fig. 8 to that of our simulation (full

line). Without knowledge of the experimental error-bars we consider the agreement between

symbols and full line to be satisfactory.

The dashed line shows a numerical proﬁle obtained for axially periodic boundary condi-

tions imposing the wavelength λ = 1.6. It diﬀers slightly from the SPI proﬁle (full line) in

the bulk part of the Γ = 12 system with rigid ends. The diﬀerence is presumably related to

the fact that the axial ﬂow, and in particular the mean-ﬂow w0 (4.4), is diﬀerent in these

two cases as discussed in Sec. IV A 2.

In Fig. 9 we compare the frequency variation of experimental and numerical L-SPI with

R1. Symbols and the full line come from Laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements [9] and

numerical simulations, respectively, of the aforementioned Taylor-Couette setup (η=0.5) of

height Γ = 12 with rigid, non-rotating lids at both ends. Note that not only the frequency

values of these experimental and numerical SPI states agree reasonably well with each other

but also their existence range in R1.

Its lower end marks the oscillatory onset. At the

upper end in R1 these SPI lose their stability to TVF — in experiments as well as in the

simulations.

However, under axially periodic boundary conditions the existence range of stable SPI

extends to signiﬁcantly larger values of R1 lying outside of the plot range of Fig. 9. The

dashed line in Fig. 9 refers to simulations done with axially periodic conditions (λ = 1.6)

that allow for a free propagation of phase. And, in addition, they allow the Reynolds-stress-

sustained mean axial ﬂow w0 (4.4) to have a ﬁnite net part < w > (4.3) that is negative for

our parameters – c.f. Sec. IV A 2. In order to compare with the SPI frequencies for rigid end

conditions we subtract from the oscillation frequencies under periodic boundary conditions

(dashed line) the pure Galilean contribution hwik and obtain the dash-dotted line. Note how

November 21, 2013

15

close the latter lies to the SPI frequencies in the system with rigid end conditions. Thus, we

ﬁnd that the SPI frequency diﬀerences [15] for the two diﬀerent end boundary conditions

are mostly due to whether the Galilean contribution hwik is suppressed or not.

IV. EXTERNAL THROUGH-FLOW

Here we discuss the inﬂuence of an externally imposed axial through-ﬂow on spiral and

on Taylor vortices. Since the eﬀect of an axial through-ﬂow on TVF has been investigated

for R2 = 0 in several works, we focus our investigation on SPI vortices.

The through-ﬂow is enforced by adding in the NSE for the axial velocity component a

constant pressure gradient of size ∂zpAP F throughout the annulus. In the absence of any

vortex ﬂow, i.e., for sub-critical control parameters this pressure gradient, ∂zpAP F , drives an

annular Poiseuille ﬂow (APF) with a radial proﬁle of the axial through-ﬂow velocity given

by

wAP F (r) =

∂zpAP F

(1 − η) ln η

ln r +

(1 + η) ln(1 − η)
(1 − η) ln η

(1 − η)2 (cid:21)

(4.1)

We checked that our numerical code reproduces this analytical solution (4.1) of the NSE.

We use its mean to deﬁne the through-ﬂow Reynolds number by

hwAP F (r)i = Re = −

∂zpAP F
8

1 − η2 + (1 + η2) ln η
(1 − η)2 ln η

.

(4.2)

Hence positive (negative) Re implies an axial ﬂow, wAP F (r),

in positive (negative) z-

direction. The last equality in Eq. (4.2) establishes the relation between the externally

applied additional axial pressure gradient and the through-ﬂow Reynolds number Re.

A. Counter-rotating cylinders

Fig. 10 shows how the through-ﬂow inﬂuences L-SPI, R-SPI, and TVF at the ﬁxed char-

acteristic driving combination R1 = 120, R2 = −100 that is located in Figs. 2 and 3 in the

region C close to the border to region E. For this parameter combination TVF is unstable

when Re = 0 and it remains unstable in the Re-range shown in Fig. 10. This is of relevance

for the through-ﬂow induced transitions between L-SPI and R-SPI (c.f. further below).

November 21, 2013

1. Bifurcation behavior

16

We present in Fig. 10(a) the primary Fourier amplitudes, |um,n|, of the radial ﬂow intensity

at mid gap versus Re. These are |u1,1| for the M = 1 L-SPI, |u−1,1| for the M = −1 R-SPI,

and |u0,1| for TVF. Fig. 10(b) shows their axial phase velocity, wph = ω/k, and Fig. 10(c)

shows the net mean axial ﬂow

(4.3)

For Re = 0 the two spirals are mirror images of each other: their radial velocities are

the same and all respective axial velocities have the same magnitude but opposite direction.

Note that the SPI Reynolds stresses drive an axial ﬂow to be discussed further below. Its

net mean, hwi (4.3), is directed opposite to the phase velocity, wph, of the respective spiral

when Re = 0. Note, however, the diﬀerence in size between |wph| ≃ 7.1 and |hwi| ≃ 1.1 [23].

A ﬁnite through-ﬂow breaks the mirror symmetry between the M = 1 L-SPI and the

M = −1 R-SPI. Their radial ﬂow amplitudes evolve with through-ﬂow as shown in Fig. 10(a).

We performed also a linear stability analysis of the combined CCF-APF state.

It shows

that for our control parameters R1 = 120, R2 = −100 the amplitudes of the M = ±1 SPI

solutions go to zero at the bifurcation threshold values of Re = ∓19.07 and Re = ±50.95.

The numerical solutions of the full nonlinear NSE showed in addition that the L-SPI (R-

SPI) is unstable near the ﬁrst threshold, Re ≃ −19 (Re ≃ 19), and that it is stable near the

second one, Re ≃ 50 (Re ≃ −50).

For small through-ﬂow – say, for −6 <

∼ Re <
∼ 6 in Fig. 10 – the two spiral solutions
coexist bistably; their particular realization depending on initial conditions. However, with

increasing |Re| that spiral suﬀers a through-ﬂow enforced loss of stability for which the

phase velocity changes sign. This happens roughly when the through-ﬂow has become

suﬃciently strong to revert an originally adverse axial phase propagation. For example, the
M = −1 R-SPI of Fig. 10 propagate for small Re <

∼ 6.6 axially downwards (i.e. opposite
to the externally imposed through-ﬂow) as for Re = 0, then become stationary, and ﬁnally
propagate upwards in through-ﬂow direction for Re >

∼ 6.6. Similarly, by symmetry, the
M = 1 L-SPI propagates in a small negative through-ﬂow upwards against the through-ﬂow
for Re >

∼ −6.6 and downwards, i.e., in through-ﬂow direction for Re <

∼ −6.6.

The direction of the imposed through-ﬂow is the preferred one for stable phase prop-

agation: A spiral that has started at small |Re| to move against the wind dies out – or,

more precisely, becomes unstable – when the wind becomes suﬃciently strong to turn it
back. Only that SPI is stable at large |Re| >

∼ 7.2 in Fig. 10 that keeps propagating into the

preferred direction of the through-ﬂow. The other one is unstable at large |Re|.

The through-ﬂow enforced loss of stability of one SPI state and the transition to the

remaining stable one is indicated schematically in Fig. 10(a) by vertical arrows. However,

we should like to stress that the transition is somewhat complex extending over the through-
ﬂow interval 6 <

∼ 7.2 the center of which locates the zero of wph at |Re| ≃ 6.6. In this
interval there are stable, mixed states with ﬁnite L- and R-SPI modes. Their amplitudes

∼ |Re| <

seem to vary largely continuously with Re (with possibly some saddle-node discontinuity)

between the pure SPI solutions: the amplitude of the spiral that loses the stability com-

petition decreases with growing |Re| towards zero while the amplitude of the winning one

increases from zero to the pure monostable ﬁnal SPI state.

Note that since TVF is unstable for the parameters of Fig. 10 it does not oﬀer an alterna-

tive transition to a ﬁnal M = 0 state as for the parameters of Sec. IV B. There, for R2 = 0,

the through-ﬂow induces a transition to stable TVF rather than to the stably coexisting

SPI with preferred propagation direction. Only when TVF is eliminated there does the

transition occur to the then monostable spiral — for details see Sec. IV B.

We also made a few calculations in a regime where TVF stably coexists with SPI for

counter-rotating cylinders. Also then the through-ﬂow induces preferably a transition to

stable TVF rather than to the stable SPI state. Thus, when the through-ﬂow destabilizes,

e. g., the M = −1 R-SPI then typically the M = 0 TVF modes grow rather than the M = 1

L-SPI modes.

2. Axial velocities wph, w0, and hwi

In the through-ﬂow range shown in Fig. 10 the phase velocity wph and the net mean ﬂow

hwi vary roughly linearly with Re. The slopes ∂wph/∂Re and ∂hwi/∂Re for SPI as well as

for TVF are roughly 1.

While the phase of the M = ±1 SPI reverts its propagation direction at Re ≃ ∓6.6 the

net mean ﬂow changes sign already at Re ≃ ±1.2. The reversal of the latter does not seem

to have any consequence. But the through-ﬂow enforced reversal of the phase velocity seems

November 21, 2013

18

to be responsible for the destabilization of the SPI that propagate at small |Re| against the

wind, i.e., into the ”wrong” direction.

In Fig. 11 we show how the radial proﬁles of the mean axial ﬂow

w0(r) =

w(r, ϕ, z, t) dϕ

(4.4)

2π

1
2π

Z
0

of spirals shown in Fig. 10 evolve with the through-ﬂow in the range −4 ≤ Re ≤ 14. We

checked that w0 is independent of z and t and that our spirals propagating in the externally

imposed axial pressure gradient still have the SPI symmetry, i.e., the ﬂow ﬁelds depend on

z, ϕ, t only via the phase combination φ (3.2) with an oscillation frequency ω that is modiﬁed

by the through-ﬂow. Then one ﬁnds from the NSE for the m = 0 azimuthal mode of the

axial velocity ﬁeld,

∂r +

(cid:18)

r (cid:19)

∂rw0 =

∂r +

(cid:18)

(uw)0 + ∂zp0 ,

(4.5)

that the SPI mean ﬂow can be driven by Reynolds stresses and/or by mean axial pressure

gradients. For Re = 0 the pressure is enforced to be axially periodic, hence ∂zp0(Re = 0) = 0.

So in that case the mean axial ﬂow is driven solely by the nonlinear Reynolds stresses. They

are rather large. For example for the R-SPI propagating at Re = 0 in negative z-direction

with phase velocity wph ≃ −7.1 the maximum of w0(r) is about 3, i.e, directed opposite to

the phase propagation and almost half as large in magnitude as wph. The net mean ﬂow hwi

(4.3) is for this case still about 1.1 and also opposite to wph.

As an aside we mention that rigid axial end conditions enforce hwi = 0 throughout the

annulus. They generate an adverse axial pressure gradient that compensates the Reynolds

stresses [25] so that w0 is practically zero in the bulk part where SPI are realized. Only in

the Ekman region w0 becomes ﬁnite showing TVF behavior there.

For the R-SPI of Fig. 11 propagating at Re > 0 opposite to the external through-ﬂow

the maximal mean ﬂow is located roughly at mid-gap. However, for the SPI propagating

into the direction of the external through-ﬂow, i.e., the R-SPI for Re < 0 and the L-SPI for

Re > 0 the extremum of w0(r) is shifted towards the inner cylinder. The mean ﬂow proﬁles

of the spirals of Fig. 11 are given within about 5% by the superposition

w0(r; Re) ≃ w0(r; Re = 0) + wAP F (r; Re)

(4.6)

of the pure, Reynolds stress generated ﬂow w0(Re = 0) of the respective SPI plus the pure,

pressure gradient enforced APF ﬂow wAP F (Re) (4.1). This holds for L-SPI as well as for R-

SPI, irrespective of whether they propagate into the direction of the through-ﬂow or against

19

it.

3. Spiral proﬁles

The through-ﬂow changes the structure of the SPI. This is documented in Figs. 12 and

13. The arrows in Fig. 12 representing the u, w vector ﬁeld of L-SPI in the r − z plane show

the eﬀect of imposing an axial through-ﬂow that increases from Re = −5(a) to Re = 10(d)

in steps of 5. Note, however, that the externally imposed axial pressure gradient does not

just add wAP F (r) to the axial velocity ﬁeld w. It also modiﬁes all vector ﬁeld components of

the SPI. The axial proﬁle of the radial ﬂow u(z) for example is changed by the through-ﬂow

as shown in Fig. 13 for increasing Re. Here the axial asymmetry of the upwards propagating

L-SPI is reduced by steepening up the leading part of u(z) ahead of the wave crests. This

reduction of the mirror-asymmetry of the radial ﬂow of L-SPI grows somewhat linearly with

increasing Re. As an aside we mention that on the other hand the TVF proﬁles of u(z)

become with increasing Re more and more asymmetric — the mirror asymmetry parameter

P (3.9) increases for TVF linearly with Re.

B. Non-rotating outer cylinder

We have investigated the inﬂuence of an externally imposed axial through-ﬂow on TVF

and SPI also for stationary outer cylinder, R2 = 0.

1. Bifurcation behavior

In Fig. 14 we show the bifurcation behavior of TVF and SPI as a function of through-ﬂow

Reynolds number Re for R2 = 0, R1 = 100. This parameter combination lies well within

the region E of Fig. 2 in which TVF, L-SPI, and R-SPI are all stable at Re = 0.

Switching on the through-ﬂow one sees in Fig. 14(a) how the dominant modes of these

vortex structures vary with Re. That SPI loses its stability for which the through-ﬂow

enforces a reversal of the phase propagation as in the case of counter rotating cylinders

(Fig. 10). Thus, also here the direction of the imposed through-ﬂow is the preferred one

November 21, 2013

20

for stable SPI at large |Re|. A spiral that has started at small |Re| to move against the

through-ﬂow becomes unstable when the latter becomes suﬃciently strong to turn it back.

On the other hand that SPI remains stable at large |Re| that keeps propagating into the

preferred direction of the through-ﬂow.

As in Fig. 10 the loss of stability takes place in the vicinity of the Reynolds number

where the axial phase velocity wph [Fig. 14(b)] of the respective SPI goes through zero. This

happens in Fig. 14 for the M = ±1 SPI at Re ≃ ∓6.4. However here we found the transition

from the then unstable SPI to occur to the stable TVF solution [c.f. arrows in Fig. 14(a)]

rather than to the other stable SPI.

We have also investigated brieﬂy the situation where the TVF solution was numerically

eliminated (here, suppressing m = 0 modes of the u-ﬁeld at mid-gap position turned out

to be an eﬃcient way to globally reduce TVF towards zero). Also then the SPI that is

unfavored by the through-ﬂow loses its stability. However, with TVF being unavailable as

ﬁnal state the transition occurs in this case to the favored SPI in a way that seems to be

similar to the one described in Sec. IV A 1.

Without the above described numerically imposed mode restriction TVF is stable for

moderate through-ﬂow rates while at suﬃciently large |Re| SPI are stable [26, 27, 28]. For

our parameters TVF decays at Re ≃ ±34 into a M = ±1 SPI as indicated by arrows in

For small through-ﬂow the phase velocity wph and the net mean ﬂow hwi vary roughly

linearly with Re. The initial slopes ∂wph/∂Re and ∂hwi/∂Re are for SPI as well as for

TVF roughly 1. However, at larger Re one sees in Fig. 14(c) that in particular hwi shows

Fig. 14(a).

nonlinear corrections.

2. Phase diagram

Fig. 15 shows the phase diagram of TVF, R-SPI, and L-SPI for stationary outer cylinder in

the control parameter plane spanned by Re and R1. The existence range of the vortex states

is bounded from below by the bifurcation threshold (full line in Fig. 15) of the respective

vortex solution out of the combined CCF-APF basic state. These bifurcation thresholds

result from a linear stability analysis of the CCF-APF state [14]. The one for TVF increases

quadratically for small Re. Also the SPI threshold curves in Fig. 15 have a somewhat

November 21, 2013

21

parabolic shape, however with minima shifted to ﬁnite Re. Thus, the threshold for L-SPI

ﬁrst decreases for small positive Re but eventually increases at larger Re. By symmetry the

R-SPI threshold curve in Fig. 15 is the mirror image under Re → −Re of the L-SPI threshold

curve. Hence small through-ﬂow destabilizes (stabilizes) the CCF-APF state against spirals

that propagate into (against) the through-ﬂow direction.

Note that for small Re in Fig. 15 TVF bifurcates ﬁrst when increasing R1. But for

suﬃciently large Re the bifurcation sequence of TVF and SPI is reversed since the bifurcation

threshold for TVF curves up faster with increasing Re than the one for L-SPI. After their

intersection stable SPI bifurcate ﬁrst out of the CCF-APF state. Hence, for example in

region E of Fig. 15 only stable L-SPI exist, in region D TVF exists but only as unstable

solution, and in region B they exist bistably.

The dashed lines in Fig. 15 are stability boundaries of the vortex solutions. Diﬀerent re-

gions of Fig. 15 between various stability boundaries and bifurcation thresholds are identiﬁed

with the respective stability properties of the vortex states in the caption of Fig. 15.

V. SUMMARY

We have numerically simulated vortex ﬂow structures of diﬀerent azimuthal wave numbers

M in the Taylor-Couette system with counter-rotating as well as with co-rotating cylinders.

In particular we have investigated the eﬀect of an externally imposed axial through-ﬂow on

the spatio-temporal properties and on the bifurcation behavior of M = 1 L-spirals, M = −1

R-spirals, and M = 0 Taylor vortices.

To that end we ﬁrst have determined for zero through-ﬂow, Re = 0, the bifurcation sur-

faces of the appropriate order parameters characterizing SPI and TVF solutions over the

R1 − R2 control parameter plane of the inner and outer cylinder’s Reynolds numbers. For

the parameter combinations explored in this work these bifurcations out of the basic CCF

state are forward and their order of appearance determines the stability of the respective

bifurcating vortex state: the vortex solution that bifurcates second is unstable. But it even-

tually becomes stable with increasing distance from the bifurcation threshold so that, e.g.,

for larger R1 there is a large region in the R1 − R2 plane with bistability of TVF and SPI. In

particular the existence region of stable SPI extends for axially periodic boundary conditions

even to positive R2 with co-rotating cylinders. Unstable solution branches were obtained by

November 21, 2013

22

selectively suppressing destabilizing modes. Stable ribbons, i.e., nonlinear combinations of

M = ±1 spirals were not found.

Simulations of axially ﬁnite systems with rigid, non-rotating lids showed in good agree-

ment with experiments how the stable existence range of SPI is reduced by stationary Ekman

vortices which suppress phase propagation at the two ends. Also the frequencies and the

wave proﬁles of the spiral vortices in the bulk of the numerical and experimental systems

agreed well with each other. Spiral proﬁles obtained for periodic and rigid end conditions

do not diﬀer much. On the other hand, the respective frequencies diﬀer basically by the

Galilean contribution hwik. Here hwi is the net axial mean ﬂow that the nonlinear Reynolds

stresses of a spiral with axial wave number k sustains with axially periodic end conditions

but not with impermeable ends.

Furthermore, we showed how the phenomenon of rigid body rotation of spirals can be

understood quantitatively in terms of the passive advection dynamics of M = ±1 vortex

perturbations whose lines of constant phase are oriented obliquely to the azimuthal CCF. The

onset spiral frequency is the mean rotation rate of the CCF, albeit weighted appropriately

by the critical eigenfunctions with the consequence that L-SPI as well as R-SPI rotate into

the same direction as the inner cylinder. The nonlinear SPI frequencies are typically smaller

than the linear ones but do not deviate substantially from them.

A ﬁnite through-ﬂow breaks the mirror symmetry between the L-SPI and the R-SPI and

it changes the structure of the SPI. The externally imposed axial pressure gradient does not

just add the annular Poiseuille ﬂow wAP F (r) to the axial velocity ﬁeld. It modiﬁes the SPI

structure, e.g., the proﬁles of the radial ﬂow in a characteristic way.

For Re = 0 L-SPI propagate axially upwards and R-SPI downwards. When they are

initially stable they continue to coexist bistably for small through-ﬂow. However, they are

no longer mirror images of each other and their phase velocities diﬀer by an amount ∝ Re.

Then, with increasing |Re| that spiral loses its stability for which the through-ﬂow enforces

the phase velocity to change direction. Only that SPI is stable at large |Re| that keeps

propagating into the preferred direction of the through-ﬂow. The other one is unstable at

large |Re|.

The SPI that loses stability upon reverting its propagation direction — i.e. the R-SPI

(L-SPI) for positive (negative) Re — preferentially undergoes a transition to propagating

TVF provided the latter is available as stable vortex state. Otherwise the transition is to

November 21, 2013

23

the then monostable L-SPI (R-SPI). Such a situation was explored in detail for negative

R2 where TVF was unstable and for other parameter combinations where the TVF solution

was eliminated numerically.

Also the situation where initially at Re = 0 all three vortex solutions are stable was elu-

cidated for diﬀerent R1 − R2 parameter combinations and in more detail for stationary outer

cylinder, R2 = 0. Here, a complete phase diagram was determined in the control parameter

plane spanned by Re and R1. We found that small through-ﬂow destabilizes (stabilizes) the

basic CCF-APF state against spirals that propagate into (against) the through-ﬂow direc-

tion. For suﬃciently large Re the bifurcation sequence of TVF and SPI is reversed since the

bifurcation threshold for TVF curves up faster with increasing Re than the one for L-SPI.

After their intersection stable SPI bifurcate ﬁrst out of the CCF-APF state. Then there

opens up a region at suﬃciently large positive Re in which only stable L-SPI but no Taylor

vortices exist for stationary outer cylinder.

FIG. 5: Axial proﬁles of the radial velocity u(z) at mid gap position for R1 = 130 and various R2

(along the thick horizontal line in the inset) covering the whole interval between the bifurcation

thresholds marked TVF and SPI, respectively, in the inset; see also Fig. 2. Full (dashed) lines refer

to negative (positive) R2. In each case the maximal radial outﬂow is chosen to lie at z = 0.5λ.

For better visibility two axial periods of the vortex proﬁles are shown. The M = 1 L-SPI are

propagating in positive z-direction. Parameters are η = 0.5, k = 3.927.

FIG. 8: Comparison of experimental and numerical axial proﬁles of the radial velocity u(r1 +0.4, z)

of an L-SPI. For better visibility more than one period is shown. Symbols and the full line denote

Laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements [9] and numerical simulations, respectively, of a Taylor-

Couette setup of height Γ = 12 with rigid, non-rotating lids at both ends. Both refer to the

bulk region at mid height with a common local wavelength of λ ≃ 1.76. There the experimental

maximum of u is scaled to our simulation result. Dashed line refers to a simulation done with

axially periodic conditions imposing a wavelength of λ = 1.6. Common parameters are η = 0.5,

R1 = 111 with R2 = −95 for the experiments and R2 = −96 for the simulations.

FIG. 9: Comparison of the frequency variation of experimental and numerical L-SPI with R1.

Symbols and the full line come from Laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements [9] and numerical

simulations, respectively, of a Taylor-Couette setup (η=0.5) of height Γ = 12 with rigid, non-

rotating lids at both ends that enforce the net mean axial ﬂow hwi (4.3) to vanish. Dashed line

refers to a simulation done with axially periodic conditions (λ = 1.6). They allow for a ﬁnite

Reynolds-stress-sustained hwi that is negative for our parameters. Upon subtracting this Galilean

contribution hwik from the oscillation frequency under periodic boundary conditions (dashed line)

one obtains the dash-dotted line that lies close to the SPI frequencies with rigid end conditions.

Common parameters are R2 = −96, however, R2 = −100 for the full line.

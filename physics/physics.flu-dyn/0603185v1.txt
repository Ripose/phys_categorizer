A Theory of Inertial Range Similarity in Isotropic Turbulence

Mogens V. Melander and Bruce R. Fabijonas
Department of Mathematics, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We consider equilibrium statistics for high Reynolds number isotropic turbulence in an incom-
pressible ﬂow driven by steady forcing at the largest scale. Motivated by shell model observations,
we develop a similarity theory for the inertial range from clearly stated assumptions. In the right
variables, the theory is scaling invariant, but in traditional variables it shows anomalous scaling.
We obtain the underlying probability density function, the scaling exponents, and the coeﬃcients
for the structure functions. An inertial range length scale also emerges.

PACS numbers: 47.27.Eq, 47.52.+j, 11.80.Cr, 47.27.Gs, 05.45.Jn, 47.27.Jv, 47.27.eb, 47.27.ed

Turbulence is often called the last great unsolved prob-
lem in classical physics. Being responsible for rapid mix-
ing and energy dissipation in ﬂuids, turbulence is also
critical in many applications. Turbulence research aims
to describe an ensemble of ﬂow realizations statistically
using moments or probability density functions (PDFs).
The simplest and most symmetric problem to consider
is steady-forced isotropic turbulence in an incompress-
ible ﬂuid. At high Reynolds numbers, large-scale forc-
ing is separated from the dissipation by a wide range of
scales where inertial forces rule and the physics is univer-
sal. In 1941, Kolmogorov [1] developed the ﬁrst theory
for this inertial range. His theory removes scale depen-
dence by normalization. Unfortunately, his scale invari-
ance is at odds with observations. The discrepancy is

called “anomalous scaling.” According to Frisch [2, p.
ix], “modern work on turbulence focuses to a large ex-
tent on trying to understand the reasons for the partial
failure of the 1941 theory.”

In the inertial range, the pth order moment or struc-
ture function Sp for the velocity diﬀerence δv(l) between
two points is a power law in the separation distance l
[2], i.e., Sp ∝ lζp. Kolmogorov [1, 2] suggested ζp = p/3.
This way, Sp(l)/Sp/2
(l) is independent of l. Moreover,
the PDFs for δv at diﬀerent l collapse to a single curve
when plotted in units of standard deviations. For a wide
inertial range, Kolmogorov’s scaling invariance seems an

mental data [2, 3, 4]. ζp is not a linear function of p (Fig.
1), and the shape of the PDF varies with scale as in Fig.
2. The deviation of ζp from p/3 is the anomalous scaling.

Naturally, the central question is this: Why no scaling
invariance? We suggest the simple answer that scaling
invariance emerges in the PDF not for δv, but rather
for a diﬀerent function. This function is easiest to ﬁnd
in wave number space. There, k ·

In shell model statistics, we have found scaling invariance
of ξ(0)
k ◦ exp, which is the mean radial proﬁle of ξk on

a logarithmic abscissa. This paper shows how scaling
invariance of ξ(0)
k ◦ exp leads to a theory of anomalous
scaling. We do not consider other ξ(m)

Let us ﬁrst consider the shell model data. Although
crude models of the Navier-Stokes equations in wave
number space, shell models [6, 7, 8] allow us to gather tur-
bulence statistics at asymptotically high Reynolds num-
bers. Moreover, shell models exhibit anomalous scaling
[6, 7]. We use Zimin’s shell model [9, 10, 11]. Built on
complex helical waves, it inherits the correct balance of
left- and right-handedness from Navier-Stokes. Wavelets
partition wave number space into shells 2nπ ≤ |k| <
2n+1π, and, in the spirit of Lorenz [8], two collective
variables Rn and Ln model all wavelet coeﬃcients within
each shell. Using toroidal Sn = Rn + Ln and poloidal
Dn = Rn − Ln velocities, the evolution equations read

Tm = 25/2T−1 for m ≥ 1; ν is the kinematic viscosity;
and F = (FS,n, FD,n) is the forcing. In polar form, we
have (Sn, Dn) = An(cos ϑn, sin ϑn), where An is the shell
amplitude. The shell energy is En = ρnA2
n/4, and the
enstrophy Zn = π24nρnA2
n, where ρn ≡ 7π8n/18 is the
wavelet density. With E =
Zn, we
form the Reynolds number Rλ = hEi ν−1(20/(3 hZi))1/2.
Our focus is equilibrium statistics for isotropic turbulence
in the classical setting of a ﬁxed integral scale (e.g., ﬁxed
box size) and steady helicity-free forcing at the largest
scale. Thus, we truncate (1)-(2) so n ≥ 0 and set the
forcing as FS,n = −δn0, FD,n ≡ 0. Using VODE [12], we
generate an equilibrium ensemble of 260,000 realizations
starting from random large scale initial conditions (Rλ ≃
3 × 106 and ν/ |F | = 1.3 × 10−5).

Let ψn be the PDF of ln An, i.e. ψn(x)dx ≡ Pr{x <
ln An < x + dx}. We compute ψn from our ensemble
using kernel density estimation. The result (Fig. 3) re-
veals scaling invariance in the inertial range: shifts and
abscissa-scaling collapse the graphs of ψn(x)/e2x to a sin-
gle curve. Thus, one function f generates ψn by the
similarity: ψn(x) = e2xτnf ((x − µn)/σn) /σn. This for-
mula expresses scaling invariance of ξ(0)
k ◦ exp. Let φn
be the PDF for An. Then, φn(x)dx = Pr{x < An <

x + dx} = Pr{ln x < ln An < ln x + d ln x} so that
φn(x) = ψn(ln x)/x, and our similarity becomes

is then η(w) = d1wβ + d2 ln w, where d1, d2 and β are
constants. Special solutions η = d1 (ln w)2 + d2 ln w and

we present analysis for β 6= 0, 1. That is, G(z) = eη(z) =

. Experimental [14] and (our) computational ev-
idence show that the joint PDF ξk is ﬁnite and non-zero
at the origin. Thus, we add the theoretical assumption
of a ﬁnite non-zero value for g(x) = M−1[zd2ed1zβ

Serving only to normalize σn, the constant d1 is absent
from ζp and Cp. We choose d1 so that (d4/d1)1/β = 1/2.

All together, we have ﬁve parameters: C3, ζ−2, ζ3, β, n0.
Kolmogorov’s 4/5-law implies ζ3 = 1. To ﬁnd the oth-
ers, we use cumulants of ln An. Let Ψn(s) be the char-
acteristic function of ψn(x) = exφn(x). By substitut-
ing x = ln u, we obtain Ψn(s) = M [φn(u), is + 1] =
n Cis2−ζis(n−n0). Clearly, ln Ψn(s) is a

linear function of n, as are the cumulants hh(ln An)mii ≡
[(−id/ds)m ln Ψn(s)]s=0. In particular, 2 hhln Anii + 1 =
− ln(7π/18) − 3n ln 2 + 2 ln(C35/2)/3 − (κ(β − 1) −
ζ−2)(n − n0) ln 2, and 4hh(ln An)2ii − 1 = −κβ(β −
1) (ln 2) (n − n0). We plot hhln Anii and hh(ln An)2ii for
our shell model data in Fig. 4. The data clearly identiﬁes
two lines. Using them, we ﬁnd C3 = 3.85, ζ−2 = −0.825,
β = 1.83, n0 = −3.7. These values collapse the data in

Theory often requires that ζp increases monotonically
[2]. This is a consequence of assuming an upper bound for
the velocity so as to avoid supersonic speeds [2]. Corre-
spondingly, the PDF for the velocity increment can not
have an inﬁnite tail, but must have compact support.
Our function g has compact support when β < 1, but not
when β > 1. Importantly, our data yields β ≃ 1.83 > 1.
Consequently, ζp has a maximum and even decreases to
negative values when p is large. Negative values of ζp are
not unphysical. In fact, they occur in 2D turbulence [16].
As a mathematical problem, turbulence described by the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations does not know of
supersonic speeds and has its own statistics. We can not
impose constraints on that statistics.
It is a diﬀerent

Our theory has scaling invariance in the form of the
similarity formula (3), but also reproduces the well
known anomalous scaling when expressed in traditional
variables (Fig. 2). Thus, by choosing the right vari-
able, anomalous scaling disappears and we obtain a col-
lapse across scales as in Figure 3. Our theory rests on
scaling invariance of
four inertial range assumptions:
ξ(0)
k ◦ exp (Eqn.(3)), existence of the exponents ζp, a ﬁ-
nite ξ(0)
k (0) 6= 0, and an invertible σn. These assump-
tions hold for our shell model. We can only conjecture
that they also hold for Navier-Stokes. To test our theory,
one should aim to reproduce the collapse in Fig. 3. That
is, sample ln (E (|k|)) for various k = |k| in the inertial
range, E (|k|) being the three-dimensional energy. Call
the PDF ψk and plot the lower part of Fig. 3 with ψk
replacing ψn. If curves for diﬀerent k can be brought to
coalesce by shifts and horizontal scaling, then our theory
applies and gives the analytical expression for ψk as well
as many other formulas.

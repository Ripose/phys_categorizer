Abstract

An elementary analytical ﬂuid ﬂow is composed by a geometric do-
main, a list of analytical constraints and by the function which depends
on the physical properties, as Reynolds number, of the considered ﬂuid.
For this object, notions of laminar or weakly turbulent behavior are de-
scribed using a simple mathematical model.

1 Elementary analytical ﬂuid ﬂows

Let L a length unit and ¯Ω a closed domain of Rn, n ≥ 2, formed by a small
number (e.g. 2 or 3) of L2 squares or L3 cubes. Here we consider the plane case,
but the notions are easly extensible to greater dimensions. Let F a ﬂuid entering
in Ω from a single edge of a square and ﬂowing out from another single edge. Let
s, 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, a parameter which describes the position of a single ﬂuid particle
along the inﬂow edge, so that s0L is the initial position of the generic particle
associated to the particular value s0 of the parameter. Let now s 7→ R(s) a
function R : [0, 1] → [0, 1] which maps a value of the parameter s to the value
identifying the position reached by the particle on the outﬂow edge, so that
this position is identiﬁed by the value R(s)L. If x, y is a cartesian coordinates
system in the plane of Ω, assume that each streamline, or each particle path in
lagrangian view, is described by a parametric curve t 7→ Φ(t) = (x(t), y(t)), with
0 ≤ t ≤ 1. The parameter t could not be, in general, the time variable of the
ﬂow. Let this parametric representation be determined by a set A of analytical
conditions regarding Φ(t) and ˙Φ(t), that is the passage of the particle in some
suitable points of Ω and the velocity ﬁeld direction in some other (or the same)
points.
An elementary analytical ﬂow is a particular list F = {Ω, R, A}. We propose a

1

simple mathematical model, at least for a particular example of domain Ω, and
show that the function R(s) can identify the physical properties of the particular
ﬂuid F ﬂowing in the domain. For simplicity, in this work assume that the ﬂow
is steady.

2 A mathematical model

In this section let Ω the domain formed by three L2 squares, the ﬁrst two along
the x-axis of a cartesian coordinates system from 0 to 2L, and the third above
the second, from L to 2L y-coordinates.

Figure 1: Domain with three unit squares.

The inﬂow edge is the segment [(0, 0), (0, L)] of the ﬁrst square and the outﬂow
edge is the segment [(L, 2L), (2L, 2L)] of the third square.

Now the set A af analytical conditions is so deﬁned:

P1. at the inﬂow edge, for t = 0 and position parameter s, let Φ(0) = (0, sL);
P2. at the outﬂow edge, for t = 1 and position parameter R = R(s), let

Φ(1) = (L(1 + R), 2L);

P3. for t = 1

2 a particle path intersects the diagonal line of the second square,
that is the line of cartesian equation y = −x + 2L; if a parameter p, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1,
describes the positions along this line, the condition is Φ( 1
2 ) = (L(2 − p), pL);
D1. at the inﬂow edge the velocity is parallel to x-axis, so that for every s

D2. at the outﬂow edge the velocity is parallel to y-axis, so that for every s

˙y(0) = 0;

˙x(1) = 0.

Note that condition P3 is a logical connection between x and y coordinates, so

2

that for each component of Φ(t) the independent conditions are four: assuming,
for semplicity, that the components are polinomial expressions on variable t,
the candidates to satisfy the set A = {P1, P2, P3, D1, D2} of conditions are the
cubics x(t) = at3 + bt2 + ct + d and y(t) = et3 + f t2 + gt + h.

Let proceed with the computation of these cubics.
From derivation condition D1 follows g = 0. From passage condition P1 follows
d = 0 and h = sL. From condition D2 follows c = −3a − 2b. With these partial
results, from condition P3 follows b = −L(1 + R) − 2a and c = a + 2L(1 + R).
Now, using condition P2, the computation gives a = L(10 − 6R − 8p), so that
the ﬁrst component is

x(t) = L(10 − 6R − 8p)t3

+ L(−21 + 11R + 16p)t2

+ L(12 − 4R − 8p)t

(1)

With a similar computation, the second component is

y(t) = L(4 + 6s − 8p)t3

+ L(−2 − 7s + 8p)t2

+ Ls

(2)

Note that, with this model, the second component doesn’t depend on function
R(s).
For semplicity, let p = s, that is the particles paths are not disturbed until the
line y = −x + 2L. In this case the y-component has the form

y(t) = L(4 − 2s)t3

+ L(−2 + s)t2

+ Ls

3 The laminar case

In the laminar case assume that particles paths don’t intersect themselves, that
is the outﬂow positions on the ﬁnal edge of ¯Ω are the same as inﬂow positions.
The analytical expression of this geometrical condition is simply

R(s) = 1 − s
(4)
The laminar elementary analytical ﬂow F = {Ω, A, R} is so completely deﬁned;
its particles paths have the form

Φ(t) = {L(2 − s)(2t3

(5)
Note that the expression (4) for R(s) depends on the shape of the domain ¯Ω,
as expected; e.g., in the case of a rectangular domain with the outﬂow edge
parallel to the inﬂow edge, the expression should be R(s) = s.

The weak turbulence notion ([5]) regards the physical situation of a ﬂow where
turbulence is not fully developed and it could be described by deterministic

mathematical law ([4]). For an elementary analytical ﬂow, such mathematical
description can be made by a suitable choice of the function R(s), which maps
the initial inﬂow position of a particle to its outﬂow position.
In order to ﬁnd a possible expression for R(s), assume that some geometrical
point of the ﬁnal edge can be reached by more than one ﬂuid particle, so that
paths intersects themselves, as expected in a turbulent ﬂow. Also, the analyt-
ical expression of R(s) should be such that, in the case of suitable conditions,
the laminar case (4) can be a mathematical limit for great values of viscosity
(viscous limit, see [1]). A mathematical condition is that R(s) ∈ [0, 1] for every
s. Assume also that weak turbulence, as expected, is associate to the analytical
condition R ∈ Cm([0, 1]) for some integer m ≥ 0.
Note that a possible expression satisfying all the previous conditions is R(s) =
1
2 [1 + sin(α)], where α = α(s) could be computed using the viscous limit. As-
sume that this limit is deﬁned for Reynolds number Re approaching a value cF,
Re → cF, with cF a constant which should depend on the nature of the ﬂuid and
on the geometrical and physical properties of the ﬂow. The most simple form
for α is α = a Re s + b, therefore

Re → cF ⇒ α → acFs + b
(6)
Assuming acFs + b suﬃciently small, for Re ≈ cF follows sin(α) ≈ acFs + b,
therefore it must be

5 Concluding remarks and further developments

The notion of elementary ﬂow is characterized by a domain, a list of analytical
constraints and by the function R = R(s) : [0, 1] → [0, 1] which depends on the

5

geometrical and physical properties of the considered ﬂuid. A particular weakly
turbulent behavior can be obtained when R(s) is a periodic function. Then
laminar behavior is a viscous limit of this model.
Some questions arise.
It could be investigated the relation between particles paths (or streamlines)
Φ(t) and the solutions of Navier-Stokes equations, probably obtaining a mathe-
matical relation between R and pressure, and an expression for the ﬂow constant
cF.
if the t parameter is proportional to time, func-
In the case of evolution, e.g.
tion R(s) could be characterized using the Richardson’s Law ([2]) on particles
dispersion in turbulent ﬂows.
Can be full developed turbulence a limit of this weak turbulence model? For
very high Reynolds numbers the function R(s) expressed by (8) formula has no
limit for every s, or has not a deterministic behavior: the vertical line [0, 1] is
an accumulation line for its graph, therefore no prediction about the outﬂow
position of a particle is possible. Perhaps it can be useful a convergence, for
some kind of metric, of a succession {Rn(s)}n=1,2,3,... of continuous Rs to some
step function, in order to describe full turbulence ﬂow and its phenomemon of
intermittency ([3]).
Finally, can be a real ﬂuid ﬂow described by some kind of combination of el-
ementary ﬂows? Perhaps a combination, or a succession, of elementary ﬂows
with a common function R(s) and variable analytical constraints {An}n=1,2,3,...
could be a useful representation of a real ﬂow of a single ﬂuid.

(Dated: June 21, 2011)

We measured Reynolds numbers Re of turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection over the Rayleigh-
number range 2 × 108 <∼ R <∼ 1011 and Prandtl-number range 3.3 <∼ σ <∼ 29 for cylindrical samples of
aspect ratio Γ = 1. For R <∼ Rc ≃ 3 × 109 we found Re ∼ Rβef f with βef f ≃ 0.46 < 1/2. Here both
the σ- and R-dependences are quantitatively consistent with the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) prediction.
−3/4R1/2, which diﬀers from the GL prediction. The relatively
For R > Rc we found Re = 0.106 σ
sharp transition at Rc to the large-R regime suggests a qualitative and sudden change that renders
the GL prediction inapplicable.

Understanding turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection
(RBC) in a ﬂuid heated from below [1] remains one of
the challenging problems in nonlinear physics. It is well
established that a major component of the dynamics of
this system is a large-scale circulation (LSC) [2]. For
cylindrical samples of aspect ratio Γ ≡ D/L ≃ 1 (D is the
diameter and L the height) the LSC consists of a single
convection roll, with both down-ﬂow and up-ﬂow near the
side wall but at azimuthal locations θ that diﬀer by π. An
additional important component of the dynamics is the
generation of localized volumes of relatively hot or cold
ﬂuid, known as “plumes”, at a bottom or top thermal
boundary layer. The hot (cold) plumes are carried by
the LSC from the bottom (top) to the top (bottom) of
the sample and by virtue of their buoyancy contribute to
the maintenance of the LSC. The LSC plays an important
role in many natural phenomena, including atmospheric
and oceanic convection, and convection in the outer core
of the Earth where it is believed to be responsible for the
generation of the magnetic ﬁeld. In this Letter we report
measurements of the speed of the LSC that agree well
with a theoretical prediction by Grossmann and Lohse
[3] for relatively small applied temperature diﬀerences
∆T , but depart from this prediction rather suddenly as
∆T is increased further. Our results illustrate clearly
that a quantitative understanding of this system is still
restricted to limited parameter ranges.

The LSC can be characterized by a turnover time T

and an associated Reynolds number [4]

Re = (2L/T ) × (L/ν)

(1)

(ν is the kinematic viscosity). A central prediction of var-
ious theoretical models [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8] is the dependence
of Re(R, σ) on the Rayleigh number

R = αg∆T L3/κν

and on the Prandtl number

σ = ν/κ

(α is the isobaric thermal expansion coeﬃcient, κ the
thermal diﬀusivity, and g the acceleration of gravity).

A recent prediction by Grossmann and Lohse (GL) [3],
based on the decomposition of the kinetic and the ther-
mal dissipation into boundary-layer and bulk contribu-
tions, has been in remarkably good agreement with ex-
perimental results for Re(R, σ) [9]. However, the param-
eter range covered by the measurements was relatively
small.

We report new measurements of Re(R, σ) over a wider
range, for R up to 1011 and 3.3 <∼ σ <∼ 29. For modest
R, say R <∼ 2 × 109, we again ﬁnd very good agreement
with the predictions of GL. However, for larger R the
measurements reveal a relatively sudden transition to a
new state of the system, with a Reynolds number that is
described well by

Re = 0.106 σ

−3/4 R1/2 .

(4)

This result diﬀers both in the σ dependence and in the
R dependence from the GL prediction. We interpret our
results to indicate the existence of a new LSC state. It
is unclear at present whether the diﬀerence between this
state and the one at smaller R will be found in the ge-
ometry of the ﬂow, in the nature of the viscous boundary
layers that interact with it, or in the nature and frequency
of plume shedding by the thermal boundary layers adja-
cent to the top and bottom plates. But whatever its
nature, this state does not conform to the consequences
of the assumptions made in the GL model.

Another important aspect of the predictions is the de-
pendence of the Nusselt number (the dimensionless eﬀec-
tive thermal conductivity)

N = QL/λ∆T

(5)

(2)

(3)

on R and σ (here Q is the heat-current density and λ
the thermal conductivity). The GL model [3, 7] provides
a good ﬁt also to data for N at modest R, say up to
R ≃ 1010 [10, 11, 12]. Here we brieﬂy mention as well
measurements of N for larger R [12] that depart signiﬁ-
cantly from the GL prediction as R approaches 1011.

Measurements of Re were made for three cylindrical
samples with Γ ≃ 1. Two of them, known as the medium
and large sample, [13] had L = 24.76 and 49.69 cm re-
spectively. The third was similar to the small sample of

Ref.
[13], but had L = 9.52. As evident from Eq. 2, a
given accessible range of ∆T will provide data over dif-
ferent ranges of R for the diﬀerent L values. For the
small sample we used 2-propanol with σ = 28.9 as the
ﬂuid and measured the frequency f of oscillations of the
direction of motion of plumes across the bottom plate
to obtain Re = 2L2f /ν [14]. With the medium and
large sample we used water, mostly at mean temper-
atures Tm = 55.00, 40.00, and 29.00◦C corresponding
to σ = 3.32, 4.38, 5.55 and ν = 5.11 × 10−7, 6.69 ×
10−7, 8.25 × 10−7 m2/sec respectively. The top and
bottom plates were made of copper. A plexiglas side
wall had a thickness of 0.32 (0.63) cm for the medium
(large) sample. At the horizontal mid-plane eight ther-
mistors, equally spaced around the circumference and la-
beled i = 0, ..., 7, were imbedded in small holes drilled
horizontally into but not penetrating the side wall. The
thermistors were able to sense the adjacent ﬂuid temper-
ature without interfering with delicate ﬂuid-ﬂow struc-
tures. When a given thermistor (say i = 0) sensed a
relatively high temperature Ti due to warm upﬂow of
the LSC, then the one located on the opposite side (say
at i = 4) would sense a relatively low temperature due
to the relatively cold downﬂow.

When a warm (cold) plume passed a given side-wall
thermistor, the indicated temperature was relatively high
(low). It had been shown before [4], by comparison of
temperature sensors actually imbedded in the ﬂuid and
laser-doppler velocimetry, that this thermal signature can
be used to determine the speed, and thus the Reynolds
number, of the LSC and that it yields the same result
as actual velocity measurements. Indeed, where there is
overlap, our results for Re are in satisfactory agreement
with measurements [4] based on velocimetry.

From time series of the eight temperatures Ti(t) taken
at intervals of a few seconds and covering at least one

2

and in some cases more than ten days at each of many
values of R we determined the auto-correlation functions
(AC) Ci,j(τ ), i = j, and the cross-correlation functions
(CC) Ci,j(τ ), i = 0, . . . , 3, j = i + 4 corresponding to
signals at azimuthal positions displaced around the circle
by π. They are given by

Ci,j (τ ) = h[Ti(t) − hTi(t)it] × [Tj(t + τ ) − hTj (t)it]it . (6)

We show an example of AC (circles) and of CC (squares)
in Fig. 1.

One sees that the AC have a peak centered at the ori-
gin. It can be represented well by a Gaussian function.
The peak width indicates that the plume signal is corre-
lated over a signiﬁcant time interval. A second smaller
Gaussian peak is observed at a later time tac
that we
2
identify with one turn-over time T of the LSC. The exis-
tence of this peak indicates that the plume signal retains
some coherence while the LSC undergoes a complete ro-
tation [15]. A further very faint peak is found at 2T ,
but is not used in our analysis. These observations are
consistent with previous experiments [4, 16, 17]. This
structure is superimposed onto a broad background that
decays roughly exponentially on a time scale of O(10T ).
We believe that the background decay is caused by a slow
meandering of the azimuthal orientation of the LSC.

The CC are consistent with the AC. Here too there is
a broad, roughly exponential, background. There is no
peak at the origin, and the ﬁrst peak, of Gaussian shape,
occurs at a time delay tcc
1 = T /2 associated with half a
rotation of the LSC. A further peak is observed at 3T /2,
corresponding to 1.5 full rotations.

small sample deduced from the oscillation of the direction
of plume motion across the bottom plate [14]. These
data are for 2-propanol with σ = 28.9. For comparison,
the results of Qiu and Tong [4, 18] based on velocity
measurements for σ = 5.4 are shown as open triangles.
Our data for σ = 5.55 are in quite good agreement with
them.

the data. We regard this agreement of the prediction
with our measurements as a major success of the model.
However, for larger R the data quite suddenly depart

as R exceeds Rc ≃ 2 × 109, from a value less than 1/2
to 1/2 within experimental resolution. The GL model
can not reproduce this behavior, and we conclude that
a new large-R state is entered that does not conform to
the assumptions made in the model.

The inconsistency between the prediction and the data
can bee seen more clearly by considering the eﬀective
exponents βef f and αef f deﬁned by Eq. 11 and shown in
Fig. 3. The experimental values of βef f in Fig. 3a were
obtained by ﬁtting powerlaws to the data for σ = 4.38,
using a sliding window 0.8 decades wide. One sees that,
within experimental uncertainty, the value 1/2 is reached
at R ≃ 7 × 109. As can be seen from Fig. 2, βef f ≃ 1/2
actually is reached earlier, near R ≃ 3 × 109; the results

in Fig. 3a represent an average over a ﬁnite range of R
because a ﬁnite window width had to be employed in the
analysis. The GL model predicts the value β = 4/9 ≃
0.444 when R becomes large enough so that a pure power
law prevails (dotted line). The predicted eﬀective values

to see how the prediction could be changed by adjusting
parameters in the model so as to yield βef f = 1/2 for R >∼
2 × 109 without changing the seemingly ﬁrm prediction
βef f → 4/9 for suﬃciently large R.

Figure 3b shows αef f deﬁned by Eq. 11. Here the
GL prediction yields α = 2/3 as R becomes large (dot-
ted line). The dashed line gives the predicted αef f as
a function of R for ﬁnite R. One sees that αef f is al-
ready quite close to α in the experimental range of R.
In the range where the experimental Re/R1/2 is constant
(i.e. 2 × 109 <∼ R <∼ 1011) the data are consistent with
αef f = 3/4 as shown by the solid line, but not with
αef f ≃ 2/3. To explore this point further, we show in
Fig. 4 Reσ3/4/R1/2 as a function of σ. Here all our data
for R >∼ 3 × 109 are plotted. We note that, at each
σ, all data collapse into a narrow range consistent with
the scatter of the measurements. The horizontal solid
line, which corresponds to Eq. 4 and thus to αef f = 3/4,
passes through the points at each σ within the scatter,
although it is a bit low for the smallest σ. The solid
lines are the GL predictions for, from top to bottom,
R = 109, 1010, and 1011.

It is interesting to note that a similar inconsistency was
found also between the GL prediction and the Nusselt
number [12]. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 where we show
the reduced Nusselt number N∞/R1/3 as a function of
R. There are deviations from the prediction [7] (dashed
line) for R >∼ 1010, which is somewhat higher than the
value of Rc for the Reynolds number.

In this Letter we presented new measurements of the
Reynolds number Re of the large-scale circulation in tur-
bulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection for an aspect-ratio-
one cylindrical sample over the Rayleigh-number range
2 × 108 <∼ R <∼ 1011 and the Prandtl-number range 3.3 <∼
σ <∼ 29. For R <∼ 3 × 109, where Re ∝ R0.46, our data

4

agree well with the prediction by Grossmann and Lohse
[3]; but for larger R we ﬁnd that Re = 0.106σ3/4R1/2, in
disagreement with the GL prediction.

[18] The data points of Qui and Tong (Ref. [4]) at their largest
R values correspond to values of ∆T approaching 60◦C
and may be inﬂuenced by non-Boussinesq eﬀects. In ad-
dition, they were taken at a somewhat higher mean tem-

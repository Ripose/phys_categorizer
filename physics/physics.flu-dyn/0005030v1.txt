Abstract

The usable limits of the customary and relaxational ﬁltrational theories are

considered. The questions of applicable the locality and local thermodynamical

equilibrium principles to depict the nonstationary ﬂows are discussed. The

experimental procedures are proposed to determine the ﬁltrational ﬂows relax-

ation times.

The theoretical and experimental investigations of the ﬁltrational processes in porous

media makes for a long time and the complexity of such systems does not enables to descript

their evolution in a simple manner. The nonlinear eﬀects are an essetial in some situations.

The locality and local thermodynamical equilibrium principles applicability remains to be

investigated also. Below we will be take into consideration the linear theories only.

The Darcy equation

~W = −

k
µ∇P

(1)

was obtain from experiments under stationary ﬁltration conditions. To descript the

nonstationary processes usually used the continuously and the state equations in form

m(P ) = m0 + βm(P − P0)

ρ(P ) = ρ0(1 + βf (P − P0))

∂(mρ)

∂t

+ div(ρ ~W ) = 0

Now can produced the customary ﬁltrational equation now as

∂P
∂t − æ∆P = 0

(2)

(3)

(5)

where æ - piezoconductivity, k - permeability, µ - viscosity, P - pressure, ~W - ﬁltration

velosity , ρ - ﬂuid density, m - porosity, βm and βf - compressibility of porous matrix and

ﬂuid respectively.

The fundamental solution of (5) for onedimesional system is

P (x, t) =

Θ(t)
√4æπt

exp(−

x2
4æt

)

(6)

where Θ(t) is the Heaviside function.

We can see from (6) that the customary ﬁltrational equation leads to inﬁnity phase and

group velosities paradox like equations for classical heat conductivity and diﬀusion.

It should be mentioned that the questions of locality and local thermodynamical equi-

librium principles applicability for the systems under investigation are dicussed seldom[1].

In this aspect let us assume the solution of equation (5) for the case of plane parallel oned-

imensional ﬁltration with the constant pressure diﬀerence by the frontiers (Pf )

P (x, t) = Pf (1 − x/L −

(2/(πn))Sin(πnx/L)exp(−π2n2æt/L2))

The multiexponential dependences pressure from time make it possible to introduce

the characteristic time of the transition to the stationary state as τ ∗ = 0.1 ∗ L2/æ, where
L- the distance between frontiers. Now we can estimate this times. Let L=100 meters,

If L=1 m, æ = 1m2/sec, τ ∗ ∼ 0.1, when L < 10−2,
æ = 1m2/sec, then τ ∗ ∼ 103sec.
æ = 1m2/sec, τ ∗ < 10−5sec, and in the last case we have a situation when the velosity

of stationary state establising becomes more than the sound velosity in this media. It is a

strange conclution. Where is the time and space usable limits of the ﬁltrational theories?

One of the eﬀective attempt to resolve this situation is the relaxational theory [2]. This

theory takes into account that the local equilibriun is established in time with the according

the next relaxational equation (τw - time of relaxation)

~W + τw

∂ ~W
∂t

k
µ∇P

= −

(8)

Actually this is the local nonequilibrium procedure. In according (8) we come to the

hiperbolic equation

∂P
∂t

+ τw

∂2
∂t2 P − æ∆P = 0

with the ﬁnite phase and group velocities (Vph = q(æ/τ )).

In some cases author written relaxation equation in the double relaxational form

~W + τw

∂ ~W

µ∇(P + τP

= −

and in that event we returns to parabolic form the ﬁltrational equation with the inﬁnite

group and phase velosities

Vph = Re(√ωæs 1 + iωτp

)

To test the validity the relaxational ﬁltration theory we may to carry out the experiments

with so calles ﬁltrational waves, when the harmonic oscillations of pressure is created in

porous media. In case ωτ << 1 the relatation theory leads to the declination ∼ ωτ /2 in
phase velosities relative to customary equations (5). But in high frequences the relaxation

theory have to tends to Biot [3] theory for waves in saturated porous media. So, it is

nesessary to explore the investigations in this area. For instance we can investigate this

process by means of molecular dynamics simulation [4] and produce the ﬁltrational law

averiging the Navier and Stokes equation [5].

Abstract

An overview of recent work on Monte Carlo simulations of a granular binary mixture is presented. The results
are obtained numerically solving the Enskog equation for inelastic hard-spheres by means of an extension of the well-
known direct Monte Carlo simulation (DSMC) method. The homogeneous cooling state and the stationary state
reached using the Gaussian thermostat are considered. The temperature ratio, the fourth velocity moments and
the velocity distribution functions are obtained for both cases. The shear viscosity characterizing the momentum
transport in the thermostatted case is calculated as well. The simulation results are compared with analytical
predictions showing an excellent agreement.

1 Introduction

An usual way of capturing the dissipative nature of granular media is through an idealized ﬂuid of smooth, inelastic
hard spheres. Despite the simplicity of the model, it has been shown to be quite useful in describing the dynamics of
granular materials under rapid ﬂow conditions [1, 2]. The essential diﬀerence from ordinary ﬂuids is the absence of
energy conservation, leading to both obvious and subtle modiﬁcations of the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations.
In the context of kinetic theory, the Boltzmann and Enskog equations have been conveniently modiﬁed to account for
inelastic binary collisions. These kinetic equations have been used to derive the corresponding ﬂuid dynamic equations
with explicit expressions for the transport coeﬃcients for a monocomponent system [3, 4, 5], and for a binary mixture
at low density [6, 7]. Recently, the shear viscosity has been also calculated for a dense binary mixture [8]. In all these
cases, the standard procedure to get the transport coeﬃcients is the Chapman-Enskog expansion [9] adapted to the
case of inelastic collisions.

In the case of elastic collisions, the Chapman-Enskog solution is obtained as an expansion around the local equi-
librium distribution, while for inelastic collisions the reference state is a local cooling solution with a monotonically
time decreasing temperature. For spatially homogeneous states, the latter is referred to as the homogeneous cooling
state (HCS). Since the HCS qualiﬁes as a normal solution, all its time dependence is only through the temperature.
Nevertheless, in spite of its simplicity, no exact solution of the Boltzmann or Enskog equations describing such a state
is known even for one-component systems [10, 11]. For a granular binary mixture, the set of coupled Enskog equations
used to describe the system also admits a scaling solution in which the time dependence of the distribution functions
occurs entirely through the temperature T of the mixture. An important result is that the partial temperatures Ti
(i = 1, 2) of each species (measuring their mean kinetic energies) are diﬀerent, although their cooling rates are equal
[12, 13]. This eﬀect is generic for multicomponent systems and is a consequence of the inelasticity and the mechanical
diﬀerences of the particles. This result contrasts with previous studies in granular mixtures [14, 15, 16, 17], where the
equality of the partial temperatures was assumed. The velocity distribution functions for each species are approxi-
mately determined by using a Sonine polynomial expansion around Maxwellians, which are deﬁned in terms of the
temperature for that species. The results show that, in general, the non-Maxwellian corrections have small eﬀects
on the cooling rates and on the temperature ratio even for strong dissipation. However, the corresponding reference
Maxwellians for the two species are quite diﬀerent due to temperature diﬀerences.

As explained above, one of the main diﬃculties in obtaining the transport coeﬃcients lies in the fact that, in contrast
to what happens for elastic ﬂuids, the reference state (HCS) depends on time due to the dissipation of energy through
collisions. To overcome such diﬃculty, one possibility is to introduce external forces (thermostats) to accelerate the
particles and hence compensate for collisional cooling. As a consequence, the corresponding reference state is stationary.

1

This mechanism of energy input (diﬀerent from those in shear ﬂows or ﬂows through vertical pipes) has been used by
many authors in the past years to analyze diﬀerent problems, such as non-Gaussian properties (cumulants, high-energy
tails) of the velocity distribution function [10, 11], long-range correlations [18], and collisional statistics and short-scale
structure [19]. Since the latter requires the solution of the corresponding linearized hydrodynamic equations around
the homogeneous state, the explicit expressions for the transport coeﬃcients are needed. The use of Gauss’s principle
of least constraint leads to the Gaussian thermostat, a force proportional to the particle velocity. For the sake of
brevity, the resulting stationary state will be called here heated stationary state (HSS). It must be pointed out that
the Enskog equations in the HSS and in the HCS are formally identical when one scales the velocity with the thermal
velocity [11, 12, 13]. Therefore, the results obtained for the distribution functions and the temperature ratio γ in
the HCS applies to this thermostatted case as well. However, the response of the granular ﬂuid when small spatial
gradients are introduced is diﬀerent in both cases. In particular, the shear viscosity calculated in the HCS does not
coincide with that obtained in the HSS [5, 8]. The Navier-Stokes transport coeﬃcients of a granular monocomponent
gas have been obtained by solving the Enskog equation from the Chapman-Enskog method around the HSS [5]. Also,
the shear viscosity of a binary mixture in the HSS has been calculated for dilute [7] and moderately dense [8] systems.
The partial temperatures and the velocity distribution functions are approximately determined in both the HCS
and the HSS from a Sonine polynomial expansion [11, 13]. Once the HCS and the HSS are well characterized, the
transport coeﬃcients are given in terms of the solution of linear integral equations. These equations are solved by
considering the leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion as well. A natural question is whether this type of
approximation leads to accurate results. The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [20] has demonstrated
to be an eﬃcient and accurate procedure to analyse molecular gases far from equilibrium. This method, conveniently
adapted to deal with inelastic collisions and ﬁnite density systems, provides an alternative route to study the behaviour
of granular mixtures on the basis of the Boltzmann and Enskog equations, and so to establish the range of validity
of the approximations used in the theoretical predictions mentioned above. The shear viscosity of a low-density
granular gas in the HCS was determined from the DSMC method [21]. The results showed a very good agreement
with the predictions based on the Boltzmann equation in the ﬁrst Sonine approximation. The numerical experiment
consisted in preparing an initial in-homogeneous nonequilibrium state corresponding to a transverse shear wave, and
then analyzing its subsequent evolution in time. The shear wave decayed exponentially with a time scale inversely
proportional to the viscosity. An alternative route for measuring the shear viscosity consists of preparing a state of
uniform shear ﬂow (USF) using Lees-Edwards boundary conditions [22]. Macroscopically, this state is characterized by
constant density, a uniform temperature, and a linear velocity proﬁle. In a ordinary ﬂuid, unless a thermostatting force
is introduced, the temperature increases in time due to viscous heating. The corresponding energy balance equation
can be used to determine the shear viscosity for suﬃciently long times [23, 24]. In a granular ﬂuid, the relationship
between the temperature and the shear viscosity is not so simple since there is a competition between viscous heating
and collisional cooling. However, if external forces of the Gaussian form that exactly compensate for the collisional
energy loss are introduced, the viscous heating eﬀect is still able to heat the system. After a transient period, the
system reaches a linear hydrodynamic regime where the shear viscosity can be calculated from the pressure tensor.
This viscosity characterizes the momentum transport when a small perturbation is introduced in the HSS [7, 8].

The goal of this contribution is to present an overview of the results obtained by means of the Monte Carlo
simulation for a binary granular mixture in both the HCS and the HSS. The numerical data for the temperature ratio,
the velocity distribution functions, and the shear viscosity (in the case of the HSS) are compared with the analytical
results showing an excellent agreement for the range of parameters considered. The plan of the paper is as follows.
The theoretical framework and the procedure used to calculate the viscosity are described in Sec. 2. The details of
the simulation method are given in Sec. 3. The analytical results and the simulation data are compared in Sec. 4. We
close the paper in Sec. 5 with a short summary and conclusions.

2 Theoretical framework

Consider a binary mixture of smooth hard spheres of masses m1 and m2 and diameters σ1 and σ2. The inelasticity
of collisions among all pairs is characterized by three independent constant coeﬃcients of normal restitution α11, α22,
and α12 = α21, where αij is the restitution coeﬃcient for collisions between particles of species i and j. The molar
fractions xi ≡
ni/n (i = 1, 2) indicate the relative concentration of the two species, while the density of the mixture can
be measured by the volume packing fraction φ = πn/6 (x1σ3
1 + x2σ3
2). Here, ni is the number density corresponding
to species i and n = n1 + n2. Of course, the monocomponent case is recovered when one considers mechanically
equivalent particles, i.e., m1 = m2, σ1 = σ2 and αij = α.

2

As mentioned in the Introduction, the viscosity characterizing the momentum transport in the HSS is calculated
in our simulations by considering the USF with a thermostat force that exactly compensates for collisional cooling.
The shear viscosity can be obtained from the ratio of the xy-element of the pressure tensor to the shear rate for
suﬃciently long times. This viscosity characterizes the evolution of the system when small spatial gradients of the
velocity ﬁeld (for instance, a transverse shear wave) are introduced in the HSS. Let us now introduce the Enskog
equation under USF. At a microscopic level, the USF is generated by Lees-Edwards boundary conditions [22], which

First, let us consider a system that evolves in the absence of shear. Obviously, the analysis can be also carried
out from the above equations by simply setting a = 0. In the case of elastic particles (αij = 1) and in the absence of
= 0), it is well-known that the long-time solution of Eq. (1) is the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium
external forcing (
distribution function. On the other hand, if the particles are inelastic (αij < 1) and
= 0, a steady state is not
possible in uniform situations since, due to the dissipation of energy through collisions, the temperature T decreases
monotonically with time. In this case, the solution of the Enskog equation tends to the HCS, characterized by the fact
that all the time-dependence of fi occurs only through the temperature T (t) of the mixture. Dimensional analysis
requires that fi must be of the form

fi(v; t) = niv−3

2T (t)(m1 + m2)/(m1m2) is a thermal velocity deﬁned in terms of the temperature of the mixture
where v0(t) =
T (t), and v∗ = v/v0(t). Since the time dependence of fi occurs only through T (t), it follows that the temperature
ratio γ

T1/T2 must reach a constant value in the long time limit.

However, by driving a granular ﬂuid by boundaries or external ﬁelds it can reach a steady state. The energy
injected in the ﬂuid may exactly compensate for the energy dissipated by collisional cooling. The same eﬀect can be

The steady state achieved by introducing this thermostat is the HSS. It must be pointed out that the Enskog equation
in the HSS is formally identical with the Enskog equation in the HCS when one scales the velocity with the thermal
velocity v0 [11, 12, 13]. Therefore, the results obtained for the distribution functions Φi and the temperature ratio γ
in the HCS applies to this thermostatted case as well. The same does not occur with the shear viscosity.

In order to calculate the shear viscosity in the HSS, we assume now that the system is under USF. Let us consider
ﬁrst the case of elastic collisions. In the absence of a thermostatting force, the energy balance equation yields the
heating equation [23, 24, 26]

where Pxy is the xy element of the stress tensor P. Since the temperature T increases in time, so does the collision
T (t). As a consequence, the reduced shear rate a∗(t) = a/ν(t) (which is the relevant uniformity
frequency ν(t)
parameter) monotonically decreases in time and the system asymptotically tends towards that of equilibrium. This
implies that for suﬃciently long times (which means here a∗
1) the system reaches a regime described by linear
hydrodynamics, and the Navier-Stokes shear viscosity η can be identiﬁed as [26]

This route has been shown to be quite eﬃcient to measure the Navier-Stokes shear viscosity coeﬃcient in ordinary
ﬂuids [23, 24, 27]. For a granular mixture, unless a thermostat is introduced, the energy balance equation leads to
a steady state when the viscous heating eﬀect is exactly balanced by the collisional cooling [1, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].
However, if the granular mixture is excited by the Gaussian thermostat that exactly compensates for the collisional
energy loss (in this case ζ is the instantaneous value of the cooling rate ξ), the viscous heating still heats the system
and Eq. (10) remains valid. Consequently, the linear relationship (11) allows one to determine the shear viscosity
coeﬃcient in the long time limit.
It must be noted that the value of η calculated in this way corresponds to the
Navier-Stokes shear viscosity of an excited granular mixture (in the HSS) [5, 7, 8], and thus it does not necessarily
coincide with the value obtained in the unforced case (in the HCS) [6, 21].

In summary, the Enskog equations (1) provide an adequate theoretical framework to study the granular properties
= 0, then the system evolves to the HCS independently of the
in the HCS and in the HSS. If one takes a = 0 and
given by (9), the HSS is achieved. In order to obtain the shear viscosity
initial conditions considered. For a = 0 and
coeﬃcient η of the mixture in this state, an arbitrary value a
= 0 has to be taken (USF) and the thermostat force (9)
has to be introduced with ζ equal to the instantaneous value of the cooling rate ξ. The coeﬃcient η can be measured
in the long time limit.

As mentioned in the Introduction, in this context the theoretical predictions are determined by means of a Sonine
polynomial expansion. In the next section a Monte Carlo algorithm devised to solve (1) is described. The numerical
results obtained are compared with the analytical ones in Sec. 4.

3 Monte Carlo simulation method

The Enskog Simulation Monte Carlo (ESMC) method [23, 24] is an extension of the well-known direct simulation Monte
Carlo (DSMC) method [20] to dense gases, and it was devised to mimic the dynamics involved in the Enskog collision
term. Here we brieﬂy describe the adaptation of this procedure to numerically solve the problem (1). It must be pointed
out that since the sought solutions are spatially homogeneous (in the case of the USF thanks to the Lagrangian frame
used), the simulation method becomes especially easy to implement and eﬃcient from a computational point of view.
This is an important advantage with respect to molecular dynamics simulations. Nevertheless, the restriction to this

homogeneous states prevents us from analyzing the possible instability of the USF or the formation of clusters or
microstructures.

The ESMC method as applied to (1) is as follows. The velocity distribution function of the species i is represented

Note that the number of particles Ni must be taken according to the relation N1/N2 = n1/n2. At the initial state,
one assigns velocities to the particles drawn from the Maxwell-Boltzmann probability distribution:

where V 2
0i(0) = 2T (0)/mi and T (0) is the initial temperature. To enforce a vanishing initial total momentum, the
velocity of every particle is subsequently subtracted by the amount N −1
k Vk(0). In the ESMC method, the free
motion and the collisions are uncoupled over a time step ∆t which is small compared with the mean free time and the
inverse reduced shear rate a∗−1 (if a
= 0). If those quantities vary signiﬁcantly, the value of ∆t must be conveniently
updated in the course of the simulation.

In the collision stage, binary interactions between particles of species i and j must be considered. To simulate the
2 Niω(ij)
collisions between particles of species i with j a sample of 1

Here, ω(ij)

In the HSS case, after the collisions have been calculated, the thermostat force (8) is considered by making

To obtain the shear viscosity value in this state, an arbitrary value a
= 0 has to be taken (USF), and the constant ζ in
(16) must be equal to the instantaneous value of the cooling rate ξ. The latter is obtained by calculating the granular
temperature before and after the collision stage. To get the rest of quantities in the HSS, a is set equal to zero and ζ
can be chosen arbitrarily. In fact, this choice only aﬀects to the value of the granular temperature in the steady state.
In the course of the simulations, one evaluates the distribution function of the species i, its moments and the
partial temperatures Ti in the usual way. In addition, the kinetic and collisional transfer contributions to the pressure
tensor are calculated by the expressions

In this section we compare the analytical predictions mentioned in the Introduction with the numerical results obtained
from the simulation procedure described above. The dimensionless quantities calculated in both theory and simulation
are functions of the set of parameters
. For the sake of simplicity, in what
follows we shall assume that α11 = α22 = α12 ≡
Let us consider ﬁrst the analysis in the absence of shear rate. The basic quantity measuring the deviation of
the distribution functions from the corresponding Maxwellians are the cumulants ci [11, 13]. In Fig. 1, we show the
dependence of c1 and c2 on α for µ = 2, ω = 1, δ = 1 and φ = 0. We also present the corresponding result for
the one-component system (mechanically equivalent particles, i.e., µ = ω = 1). Note that the results apply in both
the HCS and in the HSS. The agreement between the simulation data and the theoretical predictions is excellent.
The small values of these coeﬃcients support the assumption of a low-order truncation in polynomial expansion and
indicate that the distribution functions for thermal velocities are well represented by the Sonine approximation. To
conﬁrm this, we have measured the deviation of the distribution functions Φi given by (7) from the corresponding
Maxwellian. More precisely, we have evaluated the function ∆i(v∗) deﬁned by the relation

One of the main new results of the description showed in Refs. [12, 13] is that the partial temperatures are diﬀerent
= 1). This conclusion contrasts with previous results derived for granular mixtures [14, 15, 16, 17], where it was
(γ
implicitly assumed the equipartition of granular energy between both species (i.e., γ = 1). In Figs. 3, 4, and 5 we
plot the temperature ratio γ versus the restitution coeﬃcient α for diﬀerent choices of the mechanical parameters
characterizing the mixture. The theory as well as the simulation results clearly indicate that γ is diﬀerent from unity,
even for weak inelasticity. Figure 3 shows the dependence of γ on α for ω = 1, δ = 2, φ = 0 and several values of
the mass ratio. The agreement between theory and simulation is very good, implying the accuracy of the expression
of γ obtained in the ﬁrst Sonine approximation. For large diﬀerences in the mass ratio, the temperature diﬀerences
are signiﬁcant. As can be observed in Fig. 4, the inﬂuence of the concentration ratio δ on the temperature ratio γ is
not as strong as that observed with the mass ratio, although is still quite important. The dependence of the relative

ratio decreases as the degree of inelasticity increases. It is evident again the excellent agreement between the Sonine
predictions and the simulation data.

and circles). The lines are the theoretical predictions and the symbols correspond to the simulation results.

Let us focus on the sudy of the shear viscosity coeﬃcient η. The theoretical analysis carried out in Refs. [5, 7, 8]
shows that the transport properties are aﬀected by the thermostat introduced.
In particular, the values obtained
for the shear viscosity in the HCS and in the HSS are diﬀerent. In Fig. 6 we plot the reduced shear viscosity η/η0,
η0 being the corresponding elastic value, in the HCS and in the HSS for a monocomponent gas. In both cases the
viscosity increases with the dissipation. However, at a quantitative level, the inﬂuence of dissipation on the viscosity
in the HCS case is smaller than in the HSS. The agreement between theory and simulation is quite good. The same
trends are observed for a binary mixture (cf. Fig. 1 in Ref. [8]).

Next, in Figs. 7, 8 and 9 we show the inﬂuence of dissipation on the reduced shear viscosity η(α)/η0 for a heated
granular binary mixture at low density (φ = 0) with diﬀerent values of the mass ratio, the size ratio, and the
concentration ratio. Three diﬀerent values of the restitution coeﬃcient are considered: α = 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7. In Fig. 7,
we plot the ratio η(α)/η0 versus the mass ratio µ for ω = δ = 1. Again, the symbols represent the simulation data while
the lines refer to the theoretical results obtained from the Boltzmann equation in the ﬁrst Sonine approximation. We
see that in general the deviation of η(α) from its functional form for elastic collisions is quite important. This tendency
becomes more signiﬁcant as the mass disparity increases. The agreement between the ﬁrst Sonine approximation and
simulation is seen to be in general quite good. This agreement is similar to the one found in the monocomponent case
(Fig. 6). At a quantitative level, the discrepancies between theory and simulation tend to increase as the restitution

coeﬃcient decreases, although these diﬀerences are quite small (say, for instance, around 2% at α = 0.7 in the disparate
mass case m1/m2 = 10).

The inﬂuence of the size ratio on the shear viscosity is shown in Fig. 8 for µ = 4 and δ = 1. We observe again
a strong dependence of the shear viscosity on dissipation. However, for a given value of α, the inﬂuence of ω on η
is weaker than the one found before in Fig. 7 for the mass ratio. The agreement for both α = 0.9 and α = 0.8 is
quite good, except for the largest size ratio at α = 0.8. These discrepancies become more signiﬁcant as the dissipation
increases (say, for instance, α = 0.7), especially for mixtures of particles of very diﬀerent sizes. Finally, Fig. 9 shows
the dependence of η(α)/η0 on the concentration ratio for µ = 4 and ω = 1. We observe that both the theory and
simulation predict a very weak inﬂuence of composition on the shear viscosity. With respect to the inﬂuence of
dissipation, the trends are similar to those found in Figs. 7 and 8: the main eﬀect of inelasticity in collisions is to
enhance the momentum transport with respect to the case of elastic collisions. The agreement now between theory
and simulation is very good, even for disparate values of the concentration ratio and/or strong dissipation. Therefore,
according to the comparison carried out in Figs. 7, 8, and 9, we can conclude that the agreement extends over a wide
range of values of the restitution coeﬃcient, indicating the reliability of the ﬁrst Sonine approximation for describing
granular ﬂows beyond the quasielastic limit.

In order to analyze density eﬀects on the shear viscosity, in Figs. 10 and 11 we plot the kinetic part and the total
value of this quantity versus the volume packing fraction. The parameters of the mixture are µ = 4, ω = 1, and

part ηk∗ = νηk/nT on the solid fraction φ, while the total shear viscosity η∗ = νη/nT is plotted in Fig. 11. Here,
ν = √πnσ2
12v0 is an eﬀective collision frequency. The good agreement between theory and simulation indicates that
both kinetic and collisional transfer contributions are given accurately by the ﬁrst Sonine approximation. As in the
monocomponent case (cf. Fig. 2 in Ref. [8]), the shear viscosity of a granular mixture decreases (increases) as the
inelasticity increases if the solid fraction is larger (smaller) than a given threshold value φ0. The value of φ0 depends
on the parameters of the mixture although it is practically independent of dissipation. For the mixture considered in
Fig. 11, φ0(α)

0.22.

Finally, we explore in Fig. 12 the inﬂuence of dissipation on the reduced shear viscosity η∗ for diﬀerent values
of the mass ratio in a mixture at ﬁnite density (φ = 0.2). As in the low-density case, we see that the inﬂuence of
dissipation on η∗ becomes important as the mass disparity increases. At a given value of the mass ratio, η∗ decreases
(increases) with dissipation if the mass ratio is smaller (larger) than a certain threshold value, the value of which
seems to be again practically independent of the restitution coeﬃcient. Regarding the comparison between kinetic
theory and simulation, we see that the agreement between both approaches is similar to the one previously obtained,
although the discrepancies tend to increase as α decreases.

5 Concluding remarks

In this contribution we have presented an overview of recent results on Monte Carlo simulations of a granular binary
mixture. We have considered two homogeneous states: the so-called homogeneous cooling state (HCS) and the
stationary state achieved when a gaussian thermostat force is introduced (HSS). It is well known that the results
obtained for the velocity distribution functions in both cases are identical when they and velocities are conveniently
scaled [11, 12, 13]. Transport properties (such as the shear viscosity coeﬃcient) are related to the response of the
granular ﬂuid when small spatial gradients are introduced. In this case, the external forces used as thermostats do
not play a neutral role. For instance, Fig. 6 shows that the discrepancy between the shear viscosity of the driven and
undriven cases is quite signiﬁcant. It must be noticed that the above conclusion only aﬀects to this type of external
forcing mechanisms, since driving the system by shaking, vibration, and even the action of a weak external ﬁeld (such
as the gravity ﬁeld) does not modify the transport coeﬃcients of the granular ﬂuid.

The main motivation of performing Monte Carlo simulations was to verify the range of validity of the approximate
analytical predictions obtained from the Enskog equation by using a Sonine polynomial expansion in both the HCS
and the HSS. In general, the agreement found is excellent in all the cases considered, even for large disparities of
masses, sizes and concentrations. Discrepancies slightly increase as energy dissipation in collisions increases. This
agreement is a further testimony to the validity of a hydrodynamic description for granular media beyond the weak
dissipation limit.

Nevertheless, the analysis based on the Enskog equation (1) is limited in several aspects. A test of the utility of the
Enskog equation at high densities is possible using molecular dynamics simulations. Previous comparisons at the level
of partial temperatures [33] and self-diﬀusion coeﬃcient [34] indicate that the range of densities for which the Enskog
theory applies decreases with increasing dissipation. It must be noted that upon describing the HCS and the HSS by the
Enskog equations (1), it has been implicitly assumed the validity of the “molecular chaos” hypothesis of uncorrelated
binary collisions. However, molecular dynamics simulations of hard disks have shown a non-uniform distribution of
impact parameters for high enough dissipation [35]. In addition, there exist long range spatial correlations in density
and ﬂow ﬁelds which can not be understood on the basis of the Enskog equation [36]. These two eﬀects are associated
with the appearance of the so-called cluster instability [37] for systems suﬃciently large. Since we have simulated
directly the spatially uniform equation (1), such an instability is precluded in the simulations.

The main ﬁnding of the analysis carried out for binary mixtures is that, in general, the partial temperatures of
each species are diﬀerent [12, 13], in contrast to what was assumed in previous studies [14, 15, 16, 17]. This violation
of energy equipartition has been subsequently conﬁrmed in experiments of vibrated granular mixtures [38, 39] and in
recent molecular dynamics simulations of the HCS [33]. The Monte Carlo simulations collected in this contribution,
and other ones not shown here, demonstrate that the analytical predictions accurately capture the dependence of the
temperature ratio on the parameters of the mixture.

The violation of energy equipartition has been also found in granular mixtures under simple shear ﬂow [29, 30, 31,

32]. The simple shear ﬂow state has been extensively studied for molecular ﬂuids as a prototype problem to analyse
nonlinear transport properties. Nevertheless, the nature of this state is quite diﬀerent in the case of granular ﬂuids.
While for elastic ﬂuids the temperature grows monotonically in time due to viscous heating [23, 24], a steady state is
possible for granular media when the eﬀect of viscosity is exactly compensated by the collisional cooling. In this case,
the system reaches a steady state and the temperature achieves a constant value. This state can be analysed using
the algorithm described in Sec. 3 by taking an arbitrary value of the shear rate a and setting ζ = 0. The value of the
reduced shear rate a∗ = a/ν, which is the uniformity parameter that characterizes the steady state, is a function of the
normal restitution coeﬃcients αij . The results presented in Refs. [29, 30, 31, 32] show again that the temperature ratio
is clearly diﬀerent from unity (as may be expected since the system is out of equilibrium) and strongly depends on the
restitution coeﬃcients as well as on the parameters of the mixture. The inﬂuence of the temperature diﬀerences on
the rheological properties was analyzed from the Boltzmann kinetic theory by using a Sonine polynomial expansion.
The comparison between kinetic theory and Monte Carlo simulations showed an excellent agreement over the range
of parameters investigated.

Perturbed plane Couette ﬂow containing a thin spanwise-oriented ribbon undergoes a subcritical bifurcation
at Re ≈ 230 to a steady 3D state containing streamwise vortices. This bifurcation is followed by several others
giving rise to a fascinating series of stable and unstable steady states of different symmetries and wavelengths.
First, the backwards-bifurcating branch reverses direction and becomes stable near Re ≈ 200. Then, the
spanwise reﬂection symmetry is broken, leading to two asymmetric branches which are themselves destabilized
at Re ≈ 420. Above this Reynolds number, time evolution leads ﬁrst to a metastable state whose spanwise
wavelength is halved and then to complicated time-dependent behavior. These features are in agreement with
experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

Research on plane Couette ﬂow has long been hampered by the absence of states intermediate in complexity between laminar
plane Couette ﬂow and three-dimensional turbulence. Intermediate states can be created, however, if a thin wire oriented in the
spanwise direction is inserted in an experimental setup [2,3]. No longer subject to Squire’s theorem, this perturbed conﬁguration
undergoes a bifurcation to a three-dimensional steady or quasi-steady state. The 3D states contain vortices oriented in the
streamwise direction and of ﬁnite streamwise extent, localized around the ribbon. As the wire radius is reduced, the Reynolds
number threshold for the bifurcation and the streamwise extent occupied by the vortices increase, while the range of Reynolds
numbers over which the 3D steady states exist decreases.

We have carried out a numerical study corresponding to the experiments of [2,3], focusing primarily on the largest wire
radius used. In a previous study [1], we carried out a linear and weakly nonlinear stability analysis of this conﬁguration. Here,
we present a detailed bifurcation diagram for this case. Our calculations show a rich bifurcation structure with many types of
solutions: stable and unstable; steady, periodic, and aperiodic; and of different symmetries. Some of these solutions persist as
the wire radius is reduced.

II. METHODS

The time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations have been solved using the spectral element code Prism [8] written by Hen-
derson. Instead of a wire, we have used a ribbon of inﬁnitesimal streamwise (x) extent whose cross-channel (y) height is taken
equal to the diameter of the wire and whose length in the homogeneous transverse (z) direction is inﬁnite. For most of the
current study the computational domain is |x| ≤ 32, |y| ≤ 1, and |z| ≤ λ/2 where λ = 2π/1.3 is approximately the numerically
determined critical wavelength. Periodic boundary conditions have been imposed at x = ±32 and at z = ±λ/2 and no-slip
conditions at the channel walls y = ±1 and at the ribbon x = 0, |y| ≤ ρ. The ratio ρ of the ribbon height to that of the channel
is set to ρ = 0.086 except where otherwise speciﬁed. In the (x, y) directions, we use 24 × 5 computational elements, each of
which is covered by a grid of 7 × 7 collocation points or interpolating polynomials. In the z direction, we use 32 Fourier modes
or gridpoints. (Simulations were also conducted in a reduced spanwise domain |z| < λ/4 with 16 Fourier modes.) This leads
to a total of 143840 gridpoints or basis functions per velocity component. To compute each asymptotic state required between
500 and 10000 nondimensional time units (i.e. units of channel width/velocity difference), which in turn required between 3
and 60 CPU hours on each of 16 processors of a Cray T3E. Some tests of the adequacy of our numerical resolution and stream-
wise domain size are reported in [1]. The resolution for complex three-dimensional ﬂows has been checked by increasing the
polynomial order from 7 to 11 and the number of Fourier modes from 32 to 64.

III. BIFURCATION SCENARIO FOR ρ = 0.086

FIG. 1. Bifurcation diagram for perturbed plane Couette ﬂow with ribbon height ρ = 0.086.

•Horizontal line: 2D states exist for all Re; they are stable for Re < ReCP = 228.
•Short-dashed line (schematic): unstable symmetric states with spanwise wavelength λ exist between ReSN = 197 and ReCP = 228.
•Hollow circles: symmetric states with λ exist between ReSN = 197 and ReH = 395; they are stable between ReSN and RePF = 201.
•Filled circles: asymmetric states with λ exist between RePF = 201 and ReSN′ = 420.
•Hollow triangles: symmetrict states with λ/2 exist for Re > ReCP′ = 330.
•Filled triangles: asymmetric states with λ/2 exist for Re > RePF′ = 440.
•Heavy long-and-short-dashed line (schematic): turbulent states occur for Re > ReCH = 300.

Figure 1 shows E3D, the energy in the z-dependent modes for all the steady states we have calculated for Re < 500, and
serves as a bifurcation diagram. Each branch is distinguished by its symmetry. The geometry and basic 2D ﬂow have O(2)
symmetry in the periodic spanwise direction z, i.e. translations z → z + z0 and reﬂections z → −z, In the (x, y) plane, they
have centrosymmetry (x, y) → (−x, −y).

The 2D branch loses stability via a circle pitchfork bifurcation at ReCP = 228, breaking the translation symmetry in z. The
critical spanwise wavelength is approximately λ = 4.8 and the critical wavenumber β = 1.3. The circle pitchfork bifurcation
is subcritical, and so the 3D states created branch leftwards and are unstable; we cannot calculate them with the methods used
here. These states have reﬂection symmetry in z and centro-symmetry in (x, y); we call them 3D symmetric states. The centro-
symmetry can visualized as follows: At the ribbon location at x = 0, four small vortices are present. The upper two vortices
persist for x > 0, while the lower two persist for x < 0.

The 3D branch changes direction and is stabilized by a saddle-node bifurcation at ReSN = 197. Its stability is short-lived,
however, lasting only until a pitchfork bifurcation at RePF = 201. The pitchfork bifurcation creates new stable branches with
only the pointwise symmetry (x, y, z) → (−x, −y, −z); we call these 3D asymmetric states. Figure 2 illustrates this symmetry
breaking by showing two different velocity ﬁelds at Re = 240. The symmetric 3D ﬁeld on the left has two different reﬂection
symmetries, satisfying both u(x, y, −z) = u(x, y, z) and u(−x, −y, z) = −u(x, y, z). The asymmetric 3D ﬁeld on the right
satisﬁes only the single reﬂection symmetry u(−x, −y, −z) = −u(x, y, z). The difference between symmetric and asymmetric
3D ﬁelds can also be seen in ﬁgure 6 discussed below.

Although the symmetric 3D branch is unstable, we can continue to calculate it by imposing reﬂection symmetry in z. It is

further destabilized, however, by a Hopf bifurcation at ReH ≈ 395, beyond which we have not followed it.

The asymmetric 3D branches change direction and are destabilized by a second saddle-node bifurcation at ReSN′ ≈ 420.
Surprisingly, time-dependent simulation at Re = 450 from an initial asymmetric state at Re = 400 leads to a metastable state
with half the imposed wavelength of λ = 4.8, or equivalently, twice the wavenumber of β = 1.3. The evolution in time of
the energies E1 and E2 in the β and 2β spanwise Fourier components is shown in ﬁgure 4. The initial ﬁeld at Re = 400 and
the metastable state at Re = 450 are shown in ﬁgure 3. This transition is symmetry-restoring since the ﬁeld is invariant under
translation in z by λ/2. The metastable state persists during 4300 . t . 5800, when E1 is near zero.

The metastable state is the λ/2 branch created from the 2D branch by a circle pitchfork bifurcation at ReCP′ = 330; see ﬁgure
1. Calculations show that it branches rightwards. Each of the two halves of the ﬁeld is symmetric under reﬂection in z about its
midplane z = λ/4 or z = −λ/4. The λ/2 branch undergoes another pitchfork bifurcation at RePF′ = 440, analogous to that

2

undergone at RePF, creating branches which do not have this reﬂection symmetry. From ﬁgure 3, it can be seen that the vortices
in the λ/2 ﬁeld remain somewhat circular; their cross-channel height is reduced along with their spanwise extent. The absence
of vortices near the upper and lower walls could indicate that the streamwise velocity proﬁle is more stable in this region than
that near the center.

x = 2 (above) and at x = −2 (below). Left: State with reﬂection symmetry in z and centro-symmetry in (x, y). For x = 2, deformation of
u contours shows that w velocity is upwards at mid-z. Thus vortex on left (right) is counter-clockwise (clockwise). For x = −2, the direction
of w and vortex orientation are reversed.
Right: State with only the pointwise symmetry (x, y, z) → (−x, −y, −z).

Re = 400. The asymmetry in z is very pronounced.
Right: Metastable state with spanwise wavelength λ/2 = 2.4 at Re = 450. The vortices occupy only the central portion in y.

FIG. 4. Time evolution of energy in the spanwise Fourier components β (E1, solid curve) and 2β (E2, dashed curve) at Re = 450. Initial
state is asymmetric β state at Re = 400. E1 decreases to near-zero levels for 4300 . t . 5800; during this interval, the ﬂow is in a metastable
state with wavenumber 2β. For t & 7500, the ﬂow undergoes large-amplitude irregular oscillations, corresponding to turbulence.

FIG. 5. Evolution of energy E0 (solid curve) and E1 (dashed curve) in the zero and β spanwise Fourier modes for a turbulent state at

Re = 350. Dots at t = 355 and t = 630 show times at which instantaneous streamwise velocity contours are plotted in ﬁgures 6 and 7.

When the λ/2 branch is created at ReCP′, it is necessarily unstable to wavelength doubling in a domain of size λ, because its
parent 2D branch is already unstable to λ modes. We are able to calculate the λ/2 branch from its creation at ReCP′ (and, for
Re > RePF′, its asymmetric version) by using a domain of size λ/2. However, we emphasize that during its appearance as a
metastable state, it is calculated in the full domain of size λ, i.e. it has been stabilized to wavelength doubling. We propose a
possible mechanism for this stabilization: At ReSN ′, the asymmetric λ branches change direction and stability. If the unstable
asymmetric λ branches terminate on the symmetric λ/2 branch in a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation ReP F ′′, then the symmetric
λ/2 branch will be stabilized to λ perturbations for Re > RePF′′, as will the asymmetric λ/2 branch for Re > RePF′.

However, this bifurcation scenario sheds no light on the subsequent evolution from the metastable λ/2 state to irregular
oscillations, as shown in ﬁgure 4 for t & 7500.
Irregular oscillations persist when the Reynolds number is reduced until
Re < ReCH = 300, where the ﬂow reverts to the steady asymmetric λ branch. We believe these states to correspond essentially
to the turbulent ﬂow observed in unperturbed plane Couette ﬂow for Re & 325 [9,12,5,7], both because of the closeness of
the lower bound in Reynolds number, and because of their appearance and streamwise extent (see ﬁgure 6). Because lack
of resolution can produce spurious time dependence, we have veriﬁed that these dynamics persist with increased numerical
resolution.

Figure 5 shows the evolution of the energy E0 and E1 in the zero and β spanwise Fourier components at Re = 350. Turbulent

states at Re = 350 are illustrated via streamwise velocity contours in ﬁgures 6 and 7. Figure 6 shows the symmetric, asymmetric,
and λ/2 steady states, in the (x, z) midplane (y = 0), as well as two instantaneous snapshots of turbulent states t = 355 and
t = 630, where E1 is locally maximal and minimal, respectively (see ﬁgure 5). Figure 7 shows the asymmetric steady state and
two instantaneous snapshots of turbulent states at t = 355, 630 in the (x, y) midplane (z = 0). The deviation from plane Couette
ﬂow is highly localized around the wire at x = 0 for the steady states, but extends over the entire streamwise domain for the
turbulent states.

In the experiments [2,3], streamwise vortices are observed for Re > 150, compared to our threshold of Re = 200. Their
wavelengths are between 5.2 and 5.7, as compared with our critical λ ≈ 4.8. Intermittency is observed experimentally for
Re > 280 and turbulence for Re > 325, in close agreement with our observation of Re > 300. Spatial period-halving events
are also observed in the experiments [4], as in our transition from the λ to the λ/2 metastable state. This period-halving transition
should be amenable to bifurcation-theoretic analysis.

IV. SMALLER RIBBONS

An important question is the dependence of this scenario on ribbon height ρ. Results from calculations performed for two
smaller heights, ρ = 0.071 and ρ = 0.043, are given in Table I. For both of these ribbon heights, the 2D ﬂow undergoes a circle
pitchfork bifurcation to a 3D eigenmode. Because the critical wavenumber, denoted by βc, changes very little with ρ, we have
given more precise values for βc(ρ) in Table I in order to specify the ρ dependence. The fact that βc is relatively insensitive
to ρ provides evidence for the idea that this instability arises from the underlying unperturbed plane Couette ﬂow rather than
depending sensitively on the perturbing ribbon. (We have used the same domain with spanwise periodicity λ = 2π/(1.30) to
calculate all secondary bifurcations.) The critical Reynolds number ReCP increases as ρ decreases, as expected from the absence
of linear instability at ﬁnite Re for plane Couette ﬂow. Both aspects of the ρ-dependence of the transition to three dimensionality
are also observed in the experiments.

For ρ = 0.071, the bifurcation scenario is similar to that at ρ = 0.086. ReSN increases more slowly as ρ decreases than
does ReCP, lending support to the hypothesis that branches of steady 3D states might continue to exist as ρ approaches zero,
although disconnected from the 2D branch. However, ReSN ′ decreases, so that the Reynolds number range over which stable
steady 3D states exist is smaller, as is also observed experimentally. Speciﬁcally, the branch of unstable 3D states bifurcating
subcritically from the 2D ﬂow occupies the Reynolds number range ReCP − ReSN, which increases from 31 for ρ = 0.086 to
65 for ρ = 0.071, while the branches of stable 3D states occupy the Reynolds number range ReSN′ − ReSN which decreases
from 223 for ρ = 0.086 to 147 for ρ = 0.071. We note that [10,11] and [6] have attempted to compute steady states of plane
Couette ﬂow containing streamwise vortices by continuing Taylor vortex ﬂow. In the plane Couette ﬂow limit, they ﬁnd that the
solutions which persist are analogues of wavy Taylor vortex ﬂow, here streamwise traveling waves, and exist for Re > 125.

For ρ = 0.043, we have been unable to ﬁnd any stable steady 3D states, despite extensive searching. Thus Table I lists only
the primary instability ReCP and βc for ρ = 0.043. We observe irregular oscillations for all the initial conditions, Reynolds
numbers, and spatial resolutions we have tried. This is in contrast to the experiments [2,3], in which approximately steady states
containing streamwise vortices are observed for ρ even smaller than 0.043. Calculations at intermediate ribbon heights would
clarify whether, when, and how the stable steady 3D states disappear as ρ is reduced.

Absence of slow transients, and the eﬀect of

imperfect vertical alignment, in turbulent

Rayleigh-B´enard convection

By Guenter Ahlers, Eric Brown, and Alexei Nikolaenko

(Received 14 January 2014)

We report experimental results for the inﬂuence of a tilt angle β relative to gravity on

turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection of cylindrical samples. The measurements were

made at Rayleigh numbers R up to 1011 with two samples of height L equal to the

diameter D (aspect ratio Γ ≡ D/L ≃ 1), one with L ≃ 0.5 m (the “large” sample) and

the other with  L ≃ 0.25 m (the “medium” sample). The ﬂuid was water with a Prandtl

number σ = 4.38.

In contrast to the experiences reported by Chill`a et al.(2004) for a similar sample but

with Γ ≃ 0.5 (D = 0.5 and L = 1.0 m), we found no long relaxation times.

For R = 9.4 × 1010 we measured the Nusselt number N as a function of β and obtained

a small β dependence given by N (β) = N0[1 − (3.1 ± 0.1) × 10−2|β|] when β is in

radian. This depression of N is about a factor of 50 smaller than the result found by

Chill`a et al.(2004) for their Γ ≃ 0.5 sample.

We measured side-wall temperatures at eight equally spaced azimuthal locations on the

horizontal mid-plane of the sample and used them to obtain cross-correlation functions

between opposite azimuthal locations. The correlation functions had Gaussian peaks

1 > 0 that corresponded to half a turn-over time of the large-scale

circulation (LSC) and yielded Reynolds numbers Rcc

e of the LSC. For the large sample

and R = 9.4×1010 we found Rcc

e (β) = Rcc

e (0)×[1+(1.85±0.21)|β|−(5.9±1.7)β2]. Similar

results were obtained also from the auto-correlation functions of individual thermometers.

These results are consistent with measurements of the amplitude δ of the azimuthal side-

wall temperature-variation at the mid-plane that gave δ(β) = δ(0)×[1+(1.84±0.45)|β|−

(3.1 ± 3.9)β2] for the same R. An important conclusion is that the increase of the speed

(i.e. of Re) with β of the LSC does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the heat transport. Thus

the heat transport must be determined primarily by the instability mechanism operative

in the boundary layers, rather than by the rate at which “plumes” are carried away by

the LSC. This mechanism apparently is independent of β.

Over the range 109 <∼ R <∼ 1011 the enhancement of Rcc

e at constant β due to the tilt

could be described by a power law of R with an exponent of −1/6, consistent with a

simple model that balances the additional buoyancy due to the tilt angle by the shear

stress across the boundary layers.

Even a small tilt angle dramatically suppressed the azimuthal meandering and the

sudden reorientations characteristic of the LSC in a sample with β = 0.

For large R the azimuthal mean of the temperature at the horizontal mid-plane diﬀered

signiﬁcantly form the average of the top- and bottom-plate temperatures due to non-

Boussinesq eﬀects, but within our resolution was independent of β.

1. Introduction

Turbulent convection in a ﬂuid heated from below, known as Rayleigh-B´enard convec-

tion (RBC), has been under intense study for some time [for reviews, see e.g. Siggia(1994),

Absence of slow transients, and the eﬀect of imperfect vertical alignment, in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection3

Kadanoﬀ(2001), Ahlers, Grossmann & Lohse (2002)]. A central prediction of models for

this system [Kraichnan(1962), Castaing et al.(1998), Shraiman and Siggia (1990), Grossmann & Lohse (2001)]

is the heat transported by the ﬂuid. It is usually described in terms of the Nusselt number

where Q is the heat current, L the cell height, A the cross-sectional area, λ the thermal

conductivity, and ∆T the applied temperature diﬀerence. The Nusselt number depends

on the Rayleigh number

and on the Prandtl number

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

Here α is the isobaric thermal expansion coeﬃcient, g the acceleration of gravity, κ the

thermal diﬀusivity, and ν the kinematic viscosity.

An important feature of turbulent RBC is the existence of a large-scale circulation

(LSC) of the ﬂuid [Krishnamurty & Howard(1981)]. For cylindrical samples of aspect

ratio Γ ≡ L/D ≃ 1 the LSC is known to consist of a single cell, with ﬂuid rising

along the wall at some azimuthal location θ and descending along the wall at a lo-

cation θ + π [see, for instance, Qiu and Tong (2001a)]. As Γ decreases, the nature of

the LSC is believed to change. For Γ <∼ 0.5 it is expected [Verzicco & Camussi(2003),

Stringano & Verzicco(2005), Sun et al. (2005)] that the LSC consists of two or more con-

vection cells, situated vertically one above the other. Regardless of the LSC structure,

the heat transport in turbulent RBC is mediated by the emission of hot (cold) volumes

of ﬂuid known as “plumes” from a more or less quiescent boundary layer above (below)

the bottom (top) plate. These plumes are swept away laterally by the LSC and rise (fall)

primarily near the side wall. Their buoyancy helps to sustain the LSC.

Guenter Ahlers, Eric Brown, and Alexei Nikolaenko

In a recent paper Chill`a et al.(2004) reported measurements using a cylindrical sample

of water with σ ≃ 2.33 and with L = 1 m and D = 0.5 m for R ≃ 1012. Their sample

thus had an aspect ratio Γ ≃ 0.5 at the borderline between a single-cell and a multi-

cell LSC. They found exceptionally long relaxation times of N that they attributed

to a switching of the LSC structure between two states. Multi-stability was observed

also in Nusselt-number measurements by Roche et al. (2004) for a Γ = 0.5 sample (see

also Nikolaenko et al. (2005) for a discussion of these data). Chill´a et al. also found

that N was reduced by tilting the sample through an angle β relative to gravity by an

amount given approximately by N (β)/N (0) ≃ 1 − 2β when β is measured in radian. A

reduction by two to ﬁve percent of N (depending on R) due to a tilt by β ≃ 0.035 of

a Γ = 0.5 sample was reported as well recently by Sun et al. (2005), although in that

paper the β-dependence of this eﬀect was not reported. Chill´a et al. developed a simple

model that yielded a depression of N for the two-cell structure that was consistent

in size with their measurements. Their model also assumes that no depression of N

should be found for a sample of aspect ratio near unity where the LSC is believed to

consist of a single convection cell; they found some evidence to support this in the work

of Belmonte et al. (1995). Indeed, recent measurements by Nikolaenko et al. (2005) for

Γ = 1 gave the same N within 0.1 percent for a level sample and a sample tilted by 0.035

rad.

In this paper we report on a long-term study of RBC in a cylindrical sample with

Γ ≃ 1. As expected, we found no long relaxation times because the LSC is uniquely

deﬁned. The establishment of a statistically stationary state after a large change of R

occurred remarkably quickly, within a couple of hours, and thereafter there were no

further long-term drifts over periods of many days.

We also studied the orientation θ0 of the circulation plane of the LSC by measur-

Absence of slow transients, and the eﬀect of imperfect vertical alignment, in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection5

ing the side-wall temperature at eight azimuthal locations [Brown et al. (2005b)]. With

the sample carefully leveled (i.e. β = 0) we found θ0 to change erratically, with large

ﬂuctuations. There were occasional relatively rapid reorientations, as observed before

by Sreenivasan et al. (2002). The reorientations usually consisted of relatively rapid ro-

tations, and rarely were reversals involving the cessation of the LSC followed by its

re-establishment with a new orientation. This LSC dynamics yielded a broad probability

distribution-function P (θ0), although a preferred orientation prevailed. When the sample

was tilted relative to gravity through an angle β, a well deﬁned new orientation of the

LSC circulation plane was established, P (θ0) became much more narrow, and virtually

all meandering and reorientation of the LSC was suppressed.

We found that N was reduced very slightly by tilting the sample. We obtained N (β) =

N0[1 − (3.1 ± 0.1) × 10−2|β|]. This eﬀect is about a factor of 50 smaller than the one

observed by Chill´a et al. for their Γ = 0.5 sample.

From side-wall-temperature measurements at two opposite locations we determined

time cross-correlation functions Ci,j . The Ci,j had a peak that could be ﬁtted well by

a Gaussian function, centered about a characteristic time tcc
1

that we interpreted as

corresponding to the transit time needed by long-lived thermal disturbances to travel

with the LSC from one side of the sample to the other, i.e. to half a turnover time of

the LSC. We found that the β-dependence of the corresponding Reynolds number Rcc
e

is given by Rcc

e (β) = Rcc

e (0) × [1 + (1.85 ± 0.21)|β| − (5.9 ± 1.7)β2]. A similar result

was obtained from the auto-correlation functions of individual thermometers. Thus there

is an O(1) eﬀect of β on Re, and yet the eﬀect of β on N was seen to be nearly two

orders of magnitude smaller. We also determined the temperature amplitude δ of the

azimuthal temperature variation at the mid-plane. We expect δ to be a monotonically

increasing function of the speed of the LSC passing the mid-plane, i.e. of the Reynolds

number. We found δ(β) = δ(0) × [1 + (1.84 ± 0.45)|β| − (3.1 ± 3.9)β2]. Thus, for small β

its β-dependence is very similar to that of the Reynolds number.

From the large eﬀect of β on Re and the very small eﬀect on N we come to the im-

portant conclusion that the heat transport in this system is not inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly

by the strength of the LSC. This heat transport thus must be determined primarily by

the eﬃciency of instability mechanisms in the boundary layers. It seems reasonable that

these mechanisms should be nearly independent of β when β is small. This result is con-

sistent with prior measurements by Ciliberto et al.(1997), who studied the LSC and the

Nusselt number in a sample with a rectangular cross section. They inserted vertical grids

above (below) the bottom (top) plate that suppressed the LSC, and found that within

their resolution of a percent or so the heat transport was unaltered. Their shadowgraph

visualizations beautifully illustrate that the plumes are swept along laterally by the LSC

when there are no grids and rise or fall vertically due to their buoyancy in the presence of

the grids. Ciliberto et al.(1997) also studied the eﬀect of tilting their rectangular sample

by an angle of 0.17 rad. Consistent with the very small eﬀect of tilting on N found by

us, they found that within their resolution the heat transport remained unaltered.

We observed that the sudden reorientations of the LSC that are characteristic of the

level sample are strongly suppressed by even a small tilt angle.

2. Apparatus and Data Analysis

For the present work we used the “large” and the “medium” sample and apparatus

described in detail by Brown et al. (2005a). Copper top and bottom plates each contained

ﬁve thermistors close to the copper-ﬂuid interface. The bottom plate had imbedded

in it a resistive heater capable of delivering up to 1.5 kW uniformly distributed over

the plate. The top plate was cooled via temperature-controlled water circulating in a

double-spiral channel. For the Nusselt-number measurements a temperature set-point

for a digital feedback regulator was speciﬁed. The regulator read one of the bottom-plate

thermometers at time intervals of a few seconds and provided appropriate power to the

heater. The top-plate temperature was determined by the temperature-controlled cooling

water from two Neslab RTE740 refrigerated circulators.

Each apparatus was mounted on a base plate that in turn was supported by three

8

legs consisting of long threaded rods passing vertically through the plate. The entire

apparatus thus could be tilted by an angle β relative to the gravitational acceleration by

turning one of the rods. The maximum tilt angle attainable was 0.12 (0.21) rad for the

large (medium) sample.

The Nusselt number was calculated using the temperatures recorded in each plate and

the power dissipated in the bottom-plate heater. The side wall was plexiglas of thickness

0.64 cm (0.32 cm) for the large (medium) sample. It determined the length L of the

sample. Around a circumference the height was uniformly 50.62 ± 0.01 cm ( 24.76 ± 0.01

cm) for the large (medium) sample. The inside diameter was D = 49.70 ± 0.01 cm (

D = 24.84 ± 0.01 cm) for the large (medium) sample. The end plates had anvils that

protruded into the side wall, thus guaranteeing a circular cross section near the ends.

For the large sample we made measurements of the outside diameter near the half-height

after many months of measurements and found that this diameter varied around the

circumference by less than 0.1%.

Imbedded in the side wall and within 0.06 cm of the ﬂuid-plexiglas interface were eight

thermistors, equally spaced azimuthally and positioned vertically at half height of the

sample. They yielded a relatively high (low) temperature reading at the angular positions

where there was up-ﬂow (down-ﬂow) of the LSC. A ﬁt of

Ti = Tc + δ cos(iπ/4 − θ0), i = 0, . . . , 7

(2.1)

yielded the mean center temperature Tc, the angular orientation θ0 of the LSC (relative

to the location of thermistor 0), and a measure δ of the LSC strength.

We expect the size of δ to be determined by the heat transport across a viscous

boundary layer separating the LSC from the side wall. Thus δ should be a monotonically

increasing function of the LSC Reynolds number Re because the boundary-layer thick-

1/2
ness is expected to decrease with Re as 1/R
e

, and because the azimuthal temperature

variation carried by the LSC near the boundary layer increases with R and thus with

Re. However, the precise relationship between δ and Re is not obvious. Experimentally

we ﬁnd, over the range 5 × 109 < R < 1011 and for the large sample, that δ is related

to R by an eﬀective power law δ ∝ R0.81, whereas Re ∝ R0.50 in this range, yielding

δ ∝ R1.62

e

. We would then expect that δ and Re will have a similar dependence on β (at

least for small β), albeit possibly with somewhat diﬀerent coeﬃcients.

From time series of the Ti(t) taken at intervals of a few seconds and covering at least

one day we determined the cross-correlation functions Ci,j (τ ) corresponding to signals

at azimuthal positions displaced around the circle by π (i.e. j = i + 4). These functions

3.1. Initial transients

In Fig. 1a we show the initial evolution of the top and bottom temperatures of the large

sample in a typical experiment. Initially the heat current was near zero and Tb and Tt

were close to 40◦C. The sample had been equilibrated under these conditions for over

one day. Near t = 0.6 h a new temperature set point of 50◦C was speciﬁed for the bottom

plate, and the circulator for the top plate was set to provide Tt ≃ 30◦C. From Fig. 1a

one sees that there were transients that lasted until about 0.9 h (1.2 h) for Tb (Tt). These

transients are determined by the response time and power capability of the bottom-plate

heater and the top-plate cooling water and are unrelated to hydrodynamic phenomena

in the liquid. Figures 1b and c show the evolution of the heat current. After the initial

rapid rise until t ≃ 0.8 h the current slowly evolved further to a statistically stationary

value until t ≃ 3 h. A ﬁt of the exponential function Q(t) = Q∞ − ∆Q exp(−t/τQ) to

the data for t > 1.2 h is shown by the solid line in Fig. 1c and yielded a relaxation time

τQ = 0.48 ± 0.04 h. We attribute this transient to the evolution of the ﬂuid ﬂow. It is

interesting to compare τQ with intrinsic time scales of the system. The vertical thermal

diﬀusion time τv ≡ L2/κ is 467 hours. Obviously it does not control the establishment

of the stationary state. If we consider that it may be reduced by a factor of 1/N with

N = 263, we still obtain a time sale of 1.78 hours that is longer than τQ. We believe

that the relatively rapid equilibration is associated with the establishment of the top and

bottom boundary layers that involve much shorter lengths lt and lb. It also is necessary

for the large-scale circulation to establish itself; but, as we shall see, its precise Reynolds

number is unimportant for the heat transport. In addition, the LSC can be created

relatively fast since this is not a diﬀusive process.

3.2. Results under statistically stationary conditions

Figure 1 shows the behavior of the system only during the ﬁrst six hours and does not

exclude the slow transients reported by Chill`a et al. that occurred over time periods of

O(102) hours. Thus we show in Fig. 2 results for N /R1/3 from a run using the large

sample that was continued under constant externally imposed conditions for nine days.

Each point corresponds to a value of N based on a time average over two hours of the plate

temperatures and the heat current. Note that the vertical range of the entire graph is

only 0.8 %. Thus, within a small fraction of 1 %, the results are time independent. Indeed,

during nearly a year of data acquisition for a Γ = 1 sample at various Rayleigh numbers,

involving individual runs lasting from one to many days, we have never experienced long-

12

Guenter Ahlers, Eric Brown, and Alexei Nikolaenko

term drifts or changes of N after the ﬁrst few hours. This diﬀers dramatically from the

observations of Chill`a et al. who found changes by about 2 % over about 4 days. We

conclude that the slow transients observed by them for their Γ = 0.5 sample do not

occur for Γ ≃ 1.

To document further the stationary nature of the system, we compared results from

the large sample for N obtained from many runs, each of one to ten days’ duration, over

a period of about ﬁve months [Nikolaenko et al. (2005), Funfschilling et al. (2005)]. The

scatter of the data at a given R is only about 0.1%. This excellent reproducibility would

not be expected if there were slow transients due to transitions between diﬀerent states

of the LSC.

Although work in our laboratory with other aspect ratios has been less extensive, we

also have not seen any evidence of drifts or transients for the larger Γ = 1.5, 2, 3, and

6 [Funfschilling et al. (2005), Brown et al. (2005a)] nor for the smaller Γ = 0.67, 0.43,

and 0.28 [Nikolaenko et al. (2005), Brown et al. (2005a)]. It may be that Γ = 0.5, being

near the borderline between a single-cell LSC and more complicated LSC structures

[Verzicco & Camussi(2003), Stringano & Verzicco(2005), Sun et al. (2005)], is unique in

this respect.

In Fig. 3 we compare results for N /R1/3 from our large sample [Nikolaenko et al. (2005)]

with those reported by Chill`a et al. (stars). Our results are larger by about 15%. To ﬁnd

a reason for this diﬀerence, we ﬁrst look at the Γ and σ dependence. The open (solid) cir-

cles represent our data for σ = 4.38 and Γ = 0.67 (0.43) and show that the dependence of

N on Γ is not very strong. The open squares (diamonds) are our results for Γ = 0.67 and

σ = 5.42 (3.62) and indicate that N actually increases slightly with σ. Thus the lower

values of N (compared to ours) obtained by Chill´a et al. for σ = 2.3 and Γ = 0.5 can not

be explained in terms of the Γ and σ dependence of N . Some of the diﬀerence can be

attributed to non-Boussinesq eﬀects that tend to reduce N [Funfschilling et al. (2005)].

However, for the largest ∆T used by Chill´a et al. (31◦C) we expect this eﬀect to be

somewhat less than 1 % [Funfschilling et al. (2005)]. Finally, the eﬀect of the ﬁnite con-

ductivity of the top and bottom plates comes to mind. This can reduce N by several %

when ∆T is large [Chaumat et al.(2002), Verzicco(2004), Brown et al. (2005a)], but it is

diﬃcult to say precisely by how much. It seems unlikely that this eﬀect can explain the

entire diﬀerence, particularly at the smaller R (and thus ∆T ) where it is relatively small.

4. Tilt-angle dependence of the Nusselt number

In Fig. 4 we show results for N from the large sample at R = 9.43 × 1010. Each data

point was obtained from a two-hour average of measurements of the various temperatures

14

and of Q. Three data sets, taken in temporal succession, for tilt angles β = 0.000, 0.087,

and 0.122 are shown. All data were normalized by the mean of the results for β = 0.

Typically, the standard deviation from the mean of the data at a given β was 0.13%.

The vertical dotted lines and the change in the data symbols show where β was changed.

One sees that tilting the cell caused a small but measurable reduction on N . In Fig. 5 we

show the mean value for each tilt angle, obtained from runs of at least a day’s duration a

each β, as a function of |β|. One sees that N decreases linearly with β. A ﬁt of a straight

line to the data yielded

N (β) = N0[1 − (3.1 ± 0.1) × 10

−2|β|] .

(4.1)

with N0 = 273.5. Simlar results for the medium cell are compared with the large-cell

results in Fig. 6. At the smaller Rayleigh number of the medium sample the eﬀect of β

on N is somewhat less. Because the eﬀect of β on N is so small, we did not make a more

detailed investigation of its Rayleigh-number dependence.

Chill`a et al. proposed a model that predicts a signiﬁcant tilt-angle eﬀect on N for

Γ = 0.5 where they assume the existence of two LSC cells, one above the other. They

also assumed that there would be no eﬀect for Γ = 1 where there is only one LSC cell.

Although we found an eﬀect for our Γ = 1 sample, we note that it is a factor of about

50 smaller than the eﬀect observed by Chill`a et al. for Γ = 0.5.

5.1. The orientation

In Fig. 7 we show the angular orientation θ0 (a) and the temperature amplitude δ

(b) of the LSC. For the ﬁrst 8000 sec shown in the ﬁgure, the sample was level (β =

0.000 ± 0.001). One sees that θ0 varied irregularly with time. The probability-distribution

function P (θ0) is shown in Fig. 8 as solid dots. Essentially all angles are sampled by the

ﬂow, but there is a preferred direction close to θ0/2π = 0.6. At t = 8000 sec, the sample

was tilted through an angle β = 0.087 radian. The direction of the tilt was chosen delib-

erately so as to oppose the previously prevailing preferred orientation. As a consequence

one sees a sharp transition with a change of θ0 by approximately π. The temperature

amplitude δ on average increased slightly, and certainly remained non-zero. From this we

conclude that the transition took place via rotation of the LSC, and not by cessation that

would have involved a reduction of δ to zero [see Brown et al. (2005b)]. We note that

θ0(t) ﬂuctuated much less after the tilt. The results for P (θ0) after the tilt are shown in

Fig. 8 as open circles. They conﬁrm that the maximum was shifted close to θ0 = 0, and

that the distribution was much more narrow.

5.2. The temperature amplitude

In Fig. 11 we show the temperature-amplitude δ(β) of the LSC as a function of β. As was

the case for N , the data are averages over the duration of a run at a given β (typically

a day or two). The solid (open) circles are for positive (negative) β. The data can be

represented well by either a linear or a quadratic equation. A least-squares ﬁt yielded

δ(β) = δ(0) × [1 + (1.84 ± 0.45)|β| − (3.1 ± 3.9)β2]

5.3. The Reynolds numbers

Using Eq. 2.2, we calculated the auto-correlation functions (AC) Ci,i, i = 0, . . . , 7, as well

as the cross-correlation functions (CC) Ci,j, j = (i + 4)%8, i = 0, . . . , 7, of the tempera-

tures measured on opposite sides of the sample. Typical examples are shown in Fig. 12.

The CC has a characteristic peak that we associate with the passage of relatively hot or

cold volumes of ﬂuid at the thermometer locations. Such temperature cross-correlations

have been shown, e.g. by Qiu and Tong (2001b) and Qiu and Tong (2002), to yield delay

times equal to those of velocity-correlation measurements, indicating that warm or cold

ﬂuid volumes travel with the LSC. The function

is consistent with the idea that the CC yields T /2 and that the AC gives T . As

expected (see Sect. 2), the β-dependences of both Reynolds numbers are the same within

their uncertainties. It is interesting to see that the coeﬃcients of the linear term also

agree with the corresponding coeﬃcient for δ (Eq. 5.1). This suggests that there may be

a closer relationship between δ and Re than we would have expected a priori. However,

the coeﬃcient of the linear term in Eq. 5.6 or 5.7 is larger by a factor of about 50 than

the corresponding coeﬃcient for the Nusselt number in Eq. 4.1.

In Fig. 14 we show measurements of Rcc

e and of δ, each normalized by its value at

β = 0, as a function of β for the medium sample and R = 1.13 × 1010. For this sample

we were able to attain larger values of β than for the large one. One sees that δ and Rcc

have about the same β dependence for small β, but that δ then increases more rapidly

suggests that the larger speed of the LSC enhances the thermal contact between the side

wall and the ﬂuid interior.

The Rayleigh-number dependence of Rcc

e at constant β is shown in Fig. 15. Here the

open (solid) circles are from the medium (small) sample. There is consistency between

the two samples, and the data can be described by a power law with a small negative

exponent. The solid line is drawn to correspond to an exponent of −1/6.

5.4. A model for the enhancement of the Reynolds number

As seen in Fig. 8, the LSC assumes an orientation for which gravity enhances the velocity

above (below) the bottom (top plate), i.e. the LSC ﬂows “uphill” at the bottom where it

is relatively warm and “downhill” at the top where it is relatively cold. This leads to an

enhancement of the Reynolds number of the LSC. As suggested by Chill`a et al.(2004),

one can model this eﬀect by considering the buoyancy force per unit area parallel to

24

Guenter Ahlers, Eric Brown, and Alexei Nikolaenko

the plates. This force can be estimated to be ρl gβα∆T /2 where l is the boundary-layer

thickness. It is opposed by the increase of the viscous shear stress across the boundary

layer that may be represented by ρνu′/l where u′ is the extra speed gained by the LSC

due to the tilt. Equating the two, substituting

for the enhancement of the Reynolds number of the LSC. From our measurements at

[Eq. 5.6] and (1.7 ± 0.4)β from Rac

[Eq. 5.7].

We note that the coeﬃcient 1.00 × 103 in Eq. 5.12 depends on the deﬁnition of Re

given in Eqs. 5.4 an 5.5 that was used in deriving the result Eq. 5.10. If the length

scale 4L had been used instead of 2L to deﬁne the speed of the LSC, as was done for

instance by Lam et al.(2002), this coeﬃcient would have been smaller by a factor of

two, yielding near-perfect agreement with the measurements. In Fig. 15 one sees that

the predicted dependence on R−1/6 also is in excellent agreement with the experimental

results. However, such good agreement may be somewhat fortuitous, considering the

Absence of slow transients, and the eﬀect of imperfect vertical alignment, in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection25

approximations that were made in the model. Particularly the use of Eq. 5.8 for the

boundary-layer thickness is called into question at a quantitative level by measurements

of Lui & Xia(1998) that revealed a signiﬁcant variation of l with lateral position. In

addition, it is not obvious that the thermal boundary-layer thickness l should be used,

as suggested by Chill`a et al.(2004), to estimate the shear stress; perhaps the thickness of

the viscous BL would be more appropriate.

In discussing their Γ = 0.5 sample, Chill`a et al.(2004) took the additional step of

assuming that the relative change due to a ﬁnite β of N is equal to the relative change

of Re. For our sample with Γ = 1 this assumption does not hold. As we saw above, the

relative change of N is a factor of about 50 less than the relative change of Re. The

origin of the (small) depression of the Nusselt number is not so obvious. Naively one

might replace g in the deﬁnition of the Rayleigh number by g cos(β); but this would

lead to a correction of order β2 whereas the experiment shows that the correction is of

order β, albeit with a coeﬃcient that is smaller than of order one. The linear dependence

suggests that the eﬀect of β on N may be provoked by the change of Re with β, but not

in a direct causal relationship.

6. Tilt-angle dependence of reorientations of the large-scale

circulation

It is known from direct numerical simulation [Hansen et al.(1991)] and from several ex-

periments [Cioni et al.(1997), Niemela et al. (2001), Sreenivasan et al. (2002), Brown et al. (2005b)]

that the LSC can undergo relatively sudden reorientations. Not unexpectedly, we ﬁnd

that the tilt angle strongly inﬂuences the frequency of such events. For a level sam-

ple (β = 0) we demonstrated elsewhere [Brown et al. (2005b)] that reorientations can

involve changes of the orientation of the plane of circulation of the LSC through any

angular increment ∆θ, with the probability P (∆θ) increasing with decreasing ∆θ. Thus,

in order to deﬁne a “reorientation”, we established certain criteria. We required that

the magnitude of the net angular change |∆θ| had to be greater than ∆θmin = (2π)/8.

In addition we speciﬁed that the magnitude of the net average azimuthal rotation rate

| ˙θ| ≡ |∆θ/∆t| had to be greater than ˙θmin = 0.1/T where T is the LSC turnover time

and ∆t is the duration of the reorientation (we refer to Brown et al. (2005b) for further

details). Using these criteria, we found that the number of reorientation events n(β) at

constant R = 9.43 × 1010 decreased rapidly with increasing |β|. These results are shown

in Fig. 16. It is worth noting that nearly all of these events are rotations of the LSC

and very few involved a cessation of the circulation. A least-squares ﬁt of the Gaussian

function

n(β) = N0exp[−(β − β0)2/w2]

(6.1)

to the data yielded N0 = 1.23 ± 0.06 events per hour, β0 = 0.0093 ± 0.0010 rad, and

w = 0.0251 ± 0.0015 rad. It is shown by the solid line in the ﬁgure.

We note that the distribution function is not centered on β = 0. The displacement of

Absence of slow transients, and the eﬀect of imperfect vertical alignment, in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection27

the center by about 9 mrad is much more than the probable error of β. We believe that

it is caused by the eﬀect of the Coriolis force on the LSC that will be discussed in more

detail elsewhere [Brown et al. (2005c)].

7. Tilt-angle dependence of the center temperature

We saw from Fig. 11 that the increase of Re with β led to an increase of the amplitude

δ of the azimuthal temperature variation at the horizontal mid-plane. An additional

question is whether the tilt-angle eﬀect on this system has an asymmetry between the top

and bottom that would lead to a change of the mean center temperature Tc (see Eq. 2.1).

Chill`a et al.(2004) report such an eﬀect for their Γ = 0.5 sample. For a Boussinesq sample

with β = 0 we expect that Tc = Tm with Tm = (Tt + Tb)/2 (Tt and Tb are the top

and bottom temperatures respectively), or equivalently that ∆t = Tc − Tt is equal to

∆b = Tb − Tc. A diﬀerence between ∆b and ∆t will occur when the ﬂuid properties

have a signiﬁcant temperature dependence [Wu & Libchaber(1991), Zhang et al.(1997)],

i.e. when there are signiﬁcant deviations from the Boussinesq approximation. For the

sequence of measurements with the large apparatus and R = 9.43 × 1010 as a function of

β the mean value of ∆T = Tb−Tt was 19.808±0.018◦C and Tc−Tm was 0.97◦C, indicating

a signiﬁcant non-Boussinesq eﬀect. In Fig. 17a we show ∆t and ∆b as a function of β.

One sees that increasing β does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect for our Γ = 1 sample. This

is shown with greater resolution in Fig. 17b where Tc − Tm = (∆t − ∆b)/2 is shown.

We believe that the small variation, over a range of about 5 × 10−3◦C, is within possible

systematic experimental errors and consistent with the absence of a tilt-angle eﬀect.

8. Summary

In this paper we reported on an experimental investigation of the inﬂuence on turbulent

convection of a small tilt angle β relative to gravity of the axes of two cylindrical Rayleigh-

B´enard samples. The aspect ratios were Γ ≃ 1.

Where there was overlap, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences between our results and

those obtained by Chill`a et al.(2004) for a Γ = 0.5 sample. We found our system to

establish a statistically stationary state quickly, within a couple of hours, after a Rayleigh-

number change whereas Chill`a et al.(2004) found long transients that they attributed to

changes of the LSC structure. We found a very small depression of the Nusselt number

Absence of slow transients, and the eﬀect of imperfect vertical alignment, in turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection29

N with increasing β, by about 4% per radian at small β. Chill`a et al.(2004) found a

decrease by 200% per radian for their sample.

In contrast to the very small eﬀect of β on N , we found an increase of the Reynolds

number Re by about 180% per radian for small β. The small eﬀect on N in the presence of

this large change of Re indicates that the heat transport does not depend strongly on the

speed of the LSC sweeping over the boundary layers. Instead, N must be determined by

instability mechanisms of the boundary layers, and the associated eﬃciency of the ejection

of hot (cold) volumes (so-called “plumes”) of ﬂuid from the bottom (top) boundary layer.

It is interesting to note that the strong dependence of Re on β in the presence of only

a very weak dependence of N on β can be accommodated quite well within the model

of Grossmann & Lohse (2002). The Reynolds number can be changed by introducing a

β-dependence of the parameter a(β) in their Eqs. (4) and (6). As pointed out by them,

a change of a has no inﬂuence on the predicted value for N .

We also measured the frequency of rapid LSC reorientations that are known to occur

for β = 0. We found that such events are strongly suppressed by a ﬁnite β. Even a

mild breaking or the rotational invariance, corresponding to β ≃ 0.04, suppresses re-

orientations almost completely.

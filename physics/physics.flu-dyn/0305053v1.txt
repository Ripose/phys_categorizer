Pressure-driven Instabilities in Cylindrical Geometry:
A New General Criterion

(Dated: 03/20/03)

A new criterion for pressure-driven interchange instabilities in cylindrical geometry is derived,
based on an alternate use of the Energy Principle. This criterion is inequivalent to Suydam’s
criterion and does not contain the magnetic shear.
In fact, it is shown that Suydam’s criterion
relates to the instability of the slow magnetosonic branch, while the present criterion relates to the
Alfv´enic one, which is the most dangerous of the two. These ﬁndings explain why pressure-driven
modes nearly always exist even if Suydam’s criterion is satisﬁed by a large margin.

PACS numbers: 47.65.+a; 52.30.Cv; 52.35.Py; 95.30.Qd

MHD instabilities are usually divided into pressure-
driven and current-driven, depending on whether the
destabilizing agent results from the interplay between
the gas pressure gradient and the ﬁeld-line curvature, or
from the component of the current parallel to the mag-
netic ﬁeld. The stability of cylindrical MHD columns
with respect to both types of processes is an old and
well-trodden subject. It was actively studied in the 60s
and 70s, both in its own sake and as an idealization of
more complex geometries for fusion devices. Important
general results have been established relatively early on,
and are now part of the standard lore on the subject
[1, 2]; among these Suydam’s criterion [3] for interchange
pressure-driven modes in an arbitrary screw pinch is di-
rectly related to the present work. Later developments
have mostly been concerned with the stability properties
of particular conﬁgurations such as tokamaks or reversed-
ﬁeld pinches.

In addition to fusion devices, astrophysical jets con-
stitute another class of physical systems for which the
existence of purely MHD unstable modes in cylindrical
geometry is extremely relevant. However, there are only
a handful of papers on current-driven instabilities in jets
([4, 5, 6], and references therein), and only a couple of
papers on pressure-driven instabilities [7, 8]. This sur-
prisingly small level of activity reﬂects the fact that the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability has long been thought to
be the most important and dangerous for jet survival, a
conjecture somewhat belied by recent numerical results
[9].

Suydam’s criterion stresses that the magnetic shear
is an important stabilizing factor in cylindrical MHD
columns. Indeed, although this criterion is only a nec-
essary condition for stability, it is well-known that the
magnetic shear plays an important role in the ability of
nuclear fusion devices to survive the catastrophic disrup-
tion usually produced by MHD instabilities. However, it
has also long been known that pressure-driven unstable
modes are easily found in MHD equilibria, with growth-
rates nearly independent of their wavenumber, indepen-
dently of whether Suydam’s criterion is satisﬁed or not

(see, e.g., Ref. [10]).

One of the objectives of this Letter is to provide a the-
oretical explanation for this fact. This is done through
the derivation of a new general criterion for the stabil-
ity of pressure-driven modes, and by a discussion of the
physical meaning of this new criterion as well as Suy-
dam’s. The criterion is obtained from an alternate use of
the MHD Energy Principle [2, 11, 12].

For static equilibria, the MHD perturbation equations

can be written as

−ρoω2ξ = −∇δP∗ + δT ≡ F (ξ),

(1)

where δT is the perturbation of the magnetic tension,
and δP∗ the total pressure perturbation, and ξ the ﬂuid
element displacement from equilibrium (a Fourier trans-
form in time has been perform). Specializing to cylindri-
cal equilibria, it is convenient to project this perturbation
equation in the three directions er, ek, e⊥ (i.e., the radial
direction, the direction parallel to the unperturbed mag-
netic ﬁeld, and the remaining one required to deﬁne an
orthonormal frame); furthermore the displacement can
be chosen as a Fourier mode [24]:

ξ = ξ(r) exp [i(ωt − mθ − kzz)] .

(2)

This choice reﬂects the fact that the equilibrium quan-
tities (the magnetic ﬁeld line helical structure, the mag-
netic ﬁeld components and the gas pressure) depend only
on radius. The equations for the parallel and perpendic-
ular displacement ξk and ξ⊥ can be solved exactly as a
function of ω2 and ξr [2, 13, 14]:

ξk,⊥ = ξk,⊥(ω2, ξr),

(3)

leading to an exact second order equation for the radial
displacement [2, 13, 14]:

−ρω2ξ =

+ C∗rξr ≡ Fr(ξr).

(4)

In this expression, A and C∗ depend in a complicated way
on the equilibrium quantities and on the mode frequency
ω.

Let us deﬁne

δWr(ξ∗

r , ξr) = −

r Fr(ξ)d3r,
ξ∗

and

δKr(ξ∗

r , ξr) =

ρo|ξr|2d3r.

where, for any choice of ξr, the remaining displacement
components ξk and ξ⊥ are speciﬁed by Eqs. (3), and ω2 =
ω2[ξr] is chosen to be the formal solution of the implicit
equation

(7)

It can be shown from the standard form of the Energy
Principle that, if there exists a total displacement such
that δWr < 0, then the system is unstable; furthermore,
ω2, as given by Eq. (7), also satisﬁes ω2 = δW/δK, where
δW and δK are the usual potential and kinetic energy of
the standard Energy Principle [14].

Obviously, this reexpression of the Energy Principle
is useful only if Eq. (7) can be solved for ω2, which is
in general a rather daunting task. Fortunately, an in-
teresting and useful simpliﬁcation of Fr is suggested by
the ballooning asymptotic ordering. In particular, let us
look for trial displacements where m, kz satisfy k⊥Lo ≫ 1
while kkLo ≪ 1 (k⊥ and kk are the components of the
(Lo is the characteristic scale of equilibrium gradients).
In other words, one considers displacements with large
wavenumbers, except in the direction of the unperturbed
magnetic ﬁeld. Because of the magnetic shear, this im-
poses that the displacement must be nonvanishing only
in the close vicinity to the magnetic resonance associated
to m, k, and implicitly deﬁned by kk = 0. Furthermore,
let us make the assumption that one can ﬁnd a trial ra-
dial displacement ξr such that the frequency ω2 which
is the solution of Eq. (7) obeys the ballooning ordering,

This assumption is easily checked a posteriori.

With these approximations, kk can be expanded to ﬁrst
order with respect to the distance to the magnetic reso-
nance ro, to read

equilibrium azimuthal, vertical, and total magnetic ﬁeld,
respectively. The width of the region where the radial
displacement is nonvanishing can be quantiﬁed from the
constraint that kkLo is small enough (see below) with
the help of this expression. For large k⊥Lo, this width is
narrow enough that one can neglect the variations with
radius of all quantities (except kk) in the corresponding
region.

From Eq. (8) (and the approximations just described),

the quantity C∗ reduces to [14]

In this expression, the system of units is chosen such
that µo = 1, and the plasma β parameter is deﬁned as

A, i.e. as the square of the ratio of the adiabatic
sound speed (for an adiabatic equation of state) to the
Alfv´en speed; this deﬁnition diﬀers from the standard
one by a factor γ/2 (γ is the adiabatic index).

With these simpliﬁcations, Eq. (7) now reads

duces positive contributions to the potential energy δWr
[14]). It is apparent that any displacement satisfying this
constraint makes ω2 < 0 provided that

while κρ = (dρo/dr)/ρo is a measure of the pressure gra-
dient scale (an adiabatic equation of state is assumed).
This reexpression of ω2
c allows us to recognise the ﬁrst
term as the usual destabilizing term due to the gas pres-
sure and the ﬁeld line curvature, while the second (sta-
bilizing) term arises from the plasma compression. As a
matter of fact, this criterion generalizes a result due to
Kadomtsev for the saussage (m = 0) mode in a Z-pinch
[15].

The reader can easily convince himself that the con-
dition required earlier on ω2 is satisﬁed for reasonable
choices of ξr, thereby insuring the self-consistency of the
result. In the whole procedure, and in contrast to com-
mon usage, neither the incompressibility condition nor
marginal stability has been assumed (actually, the two
conditions are known to be tied to one another). It is
precisely because of this feature that it was possible to
derive the criterion. Note that the usual reasoning ac-
cording to which the most dangerous modes are incom-
pressible is valid only if incompressible modes with ﬁ-
nite growth rates can be found, which is not the case for
pressure-driven modes in MHD static equilibria, as just
pointed out.

Within the ballooning asymptotic ordering, there is
another well-known limiting case of direct interest to the
purpose of this Letter, that make Eq. (4) analytically
A/L2
tractable: namely, ω2
k ≫
|ω2| ≈ 0. This limit allows us to recover Suydam crite-
rion. Indeed, in this limit, the fast variation of kk with
radius dominates over all others, and after some algebra,
Eq. (4) reduces to

p is complex otherwise. In this last case, it is possible
to show, with the help of the Energy Principle, that the
ﬂuid is unstable (see, e.g., Ref. [2] for details). Therefore,
Eq. (16) (Suydam’s criterion [3]) constitutes a necessary
condition for stability.

This stresses the fact that both the new instability cri-
terion Eq. (14), and Suydam’s necessary stability crite-
rion Eq. (16) follow from Eq. (4), but in diﬀerent limits,
and are not mutually exclusive. A deeper insight into the
relation between these two criteria is obtained by consid-
ering the low magnetic shear limit (|Bθ| ≫ |Bz|). In this
case, a WKB approximation can be made on ξr with ra-
dial wavenumber kr satisfying |k⊥r| ≫ |krr| ≫ 1, so that

3

the term involving the derivative of ξr can be neglected in
Eq. (4). Assuming ω2

to the following dispersion relation [8, 14] [25]

A necessary and suﬃcient condition of instability is

k2
k < 2βκρκc,

(18)

which requires in particular 2βκρκc > 0, a very-well
known constraint for the existence of pressure-driven in-
stabilities. Note that Eq. (18) generalizes a criterion de-
rived by Kadomtsev for the m = 1 mode [7, 8, 15]. In
the limit kk → 0, there is a small and a large root to the
dispersion relation Eq. (17), which, to leading order in
kkLo are approximately given by

Furthermore, in the limit κρ, κc → 0, the large and small
roots reduce to the standard Alfv´en and slow magne-
tosonic root, respectively. Only one of these roots is un-
stable at a time, depending on the sign of ω2
c .

Note that the large root ω2

+ satisﬁes the ordering as-
sumed in the derivation of the new criterion; furthermore,
for displacements ξr satisfying the WKB approximation
assumed in the derivation of Eq. (17), Eq. (12) gives back
Eq. (20). Reversely, the large root mode cannot satisfy
the ordering needed to rederive Suydam’s criterion, in
contrast to small root modes.

These arguments show that Suydam’s criterion relates
to the stability of the slow magnetosonic branch, while
the newly derived criterion relates to the stability of the
Alfv´enic one [26], a conclusion that can also be reached by
an analysis of the global modes behavior [14]. Of the two
branches, the Alfv´enic one the most dangerous, because
it has the fastest growth rate, so that the new criterion
is probably the more relevant of the two to ascertain the
stability of MHD cylindrical equilibria.

The practical usefulness of this new criterion also fol-
lows from the fact that ω2 . ω2
c always provides a
rather precise order of magnitude estimate of the unsta-
ble pressure modes growth rates, even for low wavenum-
bers (down to m = 1, in fact [16]); this feature also ex-
plains why the most unstable pressure-driven modes have

Under which conditions can one expect Eq. (14) to be

∗

a growth rate nearly independent of their wavenumber.
Quite surprisingly, the new criterion does not contain the
magnetic shear. In fact, the magnetic shear only role is
to limit the mode width through Eq. (13) [14]; it is be-
cause of this feature, and not because of its inﬂuence on
the growth rate, that the magnetic shear prevents the
catastrophic disruption of fusion devices’ plasmas that
the onset of Alfv´enic pressure-driven instabilities could
otherwise produce.

satisﬁed ?

It is well-known that, in a Z-pinch equilibrium, ω2
c > 0
is a constraint which is diﬃcult to realize in practice. In
more realistic equilibria, however, one expects the longi-
tudinal component of the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld to
decrease with increasing radius, so that the gas pressure-
gradient is relatively weaker in such a conﬁguration than
in a Z-pinch equilibrium, a feature which stabilizes the
plasma, unless the pressure gradient occurs only on a
rather small radial scale. In fact, this is precisely what
happens in some of the most commonly considered toka-
maks or RFP conﬁgurations. Furthermore, fusion de-
vices are collisionless over the time-scales under which
they usually operate; the simplest (albeit crude) way to
account for this is to set the adiabatic index γ = 0 in
the problem, which suppresses the compression stabiliz-
ing term. Therefore, either for one or the other rea-
son, pressure-driven interchange modes are necessarily
present in fusion devices’ plasmas, down to low azimuthal
wave-numbers m & 1, as argued above (in any case, large
wavenumber modes should be stabilized by ﬁnite Larmor
radius eﬀects); furthermore, the growth rates are com-
parable to the Alfv´en time-scale once the plasma β is of
the order of a signiﬁcant fraction of unity. These features
have been already noticed, although apparently not prop-
erly explained. Pressure-driven instabilities might play a
role in triggering the edge turbulent transport in fusion
devices; on the other hand, it is now well-known that a
velocity shear can both stabilize pressure-driven modes
(see, e.g. Ref. [17]) and reduce the MHD-driven edge
transport [18]. A velocity shear can also produce tur-
bulent transport by itself through hydrodynamical pro-
cesses, but the ﬂow curvature and the Coriolis force can
severely limit the induced turbulent transport [19, 20].

In what concerns astrophysical jets, most models stud-
ied in the literature are cold, i.e., the equilibrium is not
provided by the balance between the pressure gradient
and the magnetic tension due to the azimuthal ﬁeld, but
by a balance between the inertial force due to rotation
and the magnetic tension [21, 22, 23]. Destabilization by
the rotation inertial force is expected in this situation[8],

4

in spite of the stabilizing action of the Coriolis force,
with features very similar to the ones described above.
A more extensive study of rotation-driven instabilities
in astrophysical jets will be presented elsewhere, while a
comparison of usual pressure-driven instabilities with the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is performed in Ref. [16].

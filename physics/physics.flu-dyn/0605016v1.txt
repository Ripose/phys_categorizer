The Kelvin-Helmholtz theorem on conservation of circulations is supposed to hold for ideal in-
viscid ﬂuids and is believed to be play a crucial role in turbulent phenomena, such as production of
dissipation by vortex line-stretching. However, this expectation does not take into account singular-
ities in turbulent velocity ﬁelds at inﬁnite Reynolds number. We present evidence from numerical
simulations for the breakdown of the classical Kelvin theorem in the three-dimensional turbulent
energy cascade. Although violated in individual realizations, we ﬁnd that circulations are still con-
served in some average sense. For comparison, we show that Kelvin’s theorem holds for individual
realizations in the two-dimensional enstrophy cascade, in agreement with theory. The turbulent
“cascade of circulations” is shown to be a classical analogue of phase-slip due to quantized vortices
in superﬂuids and various applications in geophysics and astrophysics are outlined.

The theorem on conservation of circulations due to
Helmholtz [1] and Kelvin [2] is a fundamental ﬂuid dy-
namical result with many important consequences. The
circulation invariants are a topological obstruction to
ideal vortex-reconnection in classical and quantum ﬂu-
ids [3,4]. Ertel’s theorem [5] on conservation of poten-
tial vorticity in geophysical ﬂuid dynamics is a diﬀeren-
tial version of the Kelvin theorem [6]. The conservation
of circulations was also argued by G. I. Taylor [7–9] to
play a key role in the enhanced production of dissipa-
tion in turbulent ﬂuids, by the process of vortex line-
stretching. More recently, regularizations of the Navier-
Stokes equation have been proposed as model equations
for large-scale turbulence [10,11], motivated by requir-
ing that a Kelvin theorem be preserved. However, de-
spite the frequent application to turbulent ﬂows, existing
proofs of conservation of circulation are valid only for
smooth, laminar solutions of the ideal ﬂuid equations.
One might naively expect that the conservation will hold
better as the viscosity decreases, or the Reynolds num-
ber increases, but this has never been shown. This Let-
ter presents evidence from numerical simulations both for
the breakdown of the classical Kelvin theorem and for a
generalized version that is still valid in turbulent ﬂow at
inﬁnite Reynolds number.

We consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation

in space dimension d ≥ 2 :

∂tu + (u·∇)u = −∇p + ν △ u, ∇·u = 0,

(1)

where u(x, t) is the velocity, p(x, t) the kinematic pres-
sure (or enthalpy), and ν the kinematic viscosity. The
classical Kelvin theorem in this context states that for
any closed, rectiﬁable loop C at an initial time t0, the
circulation Γ(C, t) =

C(t) u(t)·dx satisﬁes

H

d
dt

Γ(C, t) = ν

△u(t)·dx,

(2)

IC(t)

where C(t) is the loop advected by the ﬂuid velocity, at
time t. In the inviscid limit ν → 0, it follows heuristically
from equation (2) that the circulation is conserved for
any initial loop C. This conservation law can be shown
to be a consequence of Noether’s theorem for an inﬁ-
nite dimensional gauge symmetry group of the ideal ﬂuid
model associated to particle-relabelling [12,13].

The conservation can be anomalous, however, in the
zero-viscosity limit, if the velocity ﬁeld becomes too sin-
gular. In that case, the righthand side of (2) need not
vanish as ν → 0. The situation is quite similar to that
for conservation of energy, which, as observed by On-
sager [14], can also become anomalous in the sense that
the energy dissipation ε = ν|∇u|2 need not vanish in the
inviscid limit. For the energy integral, the existence of a
dissipative anomaly can be associated to a turbulent cas-
cade with a constant mean ﬂux of energy to arbitrarily
small length-scales. See [15–17].

Anomalous circulation conservation may be formu-
lated in a similar fashion [18]. Let uℓ = Gℓ ∗ u de-
note the low-pass ﬁltered velocity at length-scale ℓ, where
Gℓ(r) = ℓ−dG(r/ℓ) is a smooth ﬁlter kernel. Then uℓ sat-
isﬁes the following equation (dropping viscous terms that
are small in the inertial-range):

∂tuℓ + (uℓ·∇)uℓ = −∇pℓ + fℓ,

(3)

where pℓ is the large-scale (modiﬁed) pressure and where
fℓ is the turbulent vortex-force:

fℓ = (u×ω)ℓ − uℓ×ωℓ.
Let us choose a rectiﬁable closed loop C in space. We
deﬁne C ℓ(t) as the loop C advected by the ﬁltered veloc-
ity uℓ and a “large-scale circulation” with initial loop C
Cℓ(t) uℓ(t) · dx. It follows
as the line-integral Γℓ(C, t) =
from (3) that

The righthand side of (5) represents a turbulent trans-
port of lines of large-scale vorticity ωℓ(t) out of the loop
Cℓ(t). Using formula (4) and the righthand rule, it is
easy to see that fℓ provides a torque that reduces the
large-scale circulation around the loop when a vortex-line
migrates outside it. This process can be seen to be local-
in-scale, with most of the transport due to scales close
to ℓ. Therefore, it is natural to think of the process as a
“circulation-cascade” [18]. This motivates the deﬁnition,
for any loop C and ﬁlter length ℓ, of a circulation-ﬂux
C fℓ · dx. If the eﬀect of the modes at lengths
Kℓ(C) = −
< ℓ is, on average,to diﬀuse the lines of large-scale vortic-
H
ity, then this deﬁnition implies that the signs of Γℓ(C, t)
and Kℓ(C, t) should be positively correlated.

The righthand side of (5)—or the circulation-ﬂux—
does not need to vanish in the limit taking ﬁrst ν → 0,
then ℓ → 0. This provides a purely inviscid mechanism
for violation of the Kelvin theorem, if the ﬂuid velocity
is suﬃciently singular. A simple estimate of the vor-
tex force shows that |fℓ| = O(|δu(ℓ)|2/ℓ), where δu(ℓ) is
the velocity increment across a length ℓ [18]. Suppose
that the velocity is H¨older continuous in space with ex-
ponent h, so that |δu(ℓ)| = O(ℓh). It follows then that
Kℓ(C) = O
for any loop C of ﬁnite length [18].
Thus, the Kelvin theorem will be valid under these as-
sumptions if h > 1/2. The latter condition will hold in
certain cases, e.g. the 2d enstrophy cascade, where it is
expected that h = 1 (with logarithmic corrections). How-
ever, in the 3d energy cascade, the condition is not ex-
pected to be true, since even the mean-ﬁeld Kolmogorov
exponent h = 1/3 is < 1/2. Thus, the rigorous results do
not settle the issue of whether Kelvin’s theorem is valid
for inﬁnite Reynolds-number turbulence in 3d, where a
non-vanishing circulation-ﬂux is possible.

To explore these questions, we have carried out a direct
numerical simulation (DNS) of eq. (1) on a 10243 peri-
odic grid using a pseudo-spectral parallel code with full
dealiasing and time-stepping by a second-order Adam-
Bashforth method. The kinetic energy was forced in
the ﬁrst two shells [19] and a statistical stationary state
was achieved after 5 large-eddy turnover times. The ﬁ-
nal Taylor-scale Reynolds number was Reλ = 383 and
about a decade of inertial range was achieved with con-
stant mean energy ﬂux and a spectral exponent close to
−5/3. We investigated the statistics of the circulation
and circulation-ﬂux on square loops of edge-length R.
The line-integrals were evaluated by using Stokes theo-
rem and then calculating the surface-integrals over the
square faces. For each value of R all square loops were
considered on the computational grid with that edge-
length, at all positions in the periodic domain and with
all three possible orientations.

In Fig. 1(a) plot the probability density function
(PDF) of the circulation-ﬂux Kℓ(C) for a square loop
with radius R = 64 (lattice units) and for several ﬁlter
lengths ℓ < R. As ℓ decreases through the inertial-range,
the PDF’s approach a form that is nearly independent
of the ﬁlter length. This invariant PDF is non-Gaussian

2

with stretched exponential tails, qualitatively similar to
the PDF of the circulation itself [20]. The crucial point
here is lack of dependence of the PDF on the ﬁlter-length
ℓ, which is analogous to the independence of the mean en-
ergy ﬂux in the inertial-range. Note that the mean of the
circulation-ﬂux must be zero in homogeneous turbulence
because of the exact identity fℓ = −∇·τ ℓ + ∇κℓ for the
turbulent vortex-force, where τ ℓ = (u u)ℓ − uℓuℓ is the
turbulent subscale stress and κℓ = (1/2)tr τ ℓ is the sub-
scale kinetic energy. However, higher-order moments of
Kℓ(C) can be non-vanishing. In Fig.1(b) we plot the rms
value of the circulation-ﬂux as a function of kc = π/ℓ for
several values of R in the inertial range. The near inde-
pendence of rms ﬂux to kc veriﬁes the existence of the cir-
culation cascade. In an inﬁnitely long inertial-range, for
ν → 0, this nonlinear cascade would lead to breakdown
of the classical Kelvin theorem. It is also interesting to
consider the R-dependence of the inertial-range value of
the rms circulation-ﬂux. In the inset to Fig.1(b) we plot
the rms value versus R, revealing a scaling very close to
R1/2. Since Kℓ(C) has the dimension of velocity-squared,
the mean-ﬁeld Kolmogorov scaling would be R2/3. The
smaller exponent shows that rms circulation-ﬂux scales
anomalously with R, similar to the circulation itself [20].

It is illuminating to compare these numerical results for
3d with corresponding results for the enstrophy cascade
in 2d. We have analyzed the solutions of a 20482 DNS,
the details of which are given in [21]. This simulation
yielded about a decade and a half of inertial-range with
constant mean enstrophy-ﬂux and an energy spectral ex-
ponent close to −3.
In Fig.2(a) we plot the PDF’s of
circulation-ﬂux Kℓ(C) from this DNS for a square loop
with R = 128 and several ﬁlter-lengths ℓ < R. Unlike
the corresponding results in Fig.1(a) for 3d, the PDF’s
are not independent of ℓ but instead narrow rapidly as
ℓ decreases. This is quantiﬁed in Fig.2(b), which plots
the rms circulation-ﬂux versus kc, again for loops with
radius R = 128. A power-law decay is observed for in-
creasing kc with an exponent between −1 and −2, con-
sistent with the rigorous bound in [18]. These results
show that the Kelvin theorem is valid in the 2d enstro-
phy cascade, whereas circulations are not conserved in
the 3d energy cascade range as ℓ → 0, due to persistent
nonlinear transport of vortex-lines.

fact, associated with the phenomenon of “spontaneous
stochasticity” in the zero-viscosity limit [22,23], the loop
C(t) should be random for a ﬁxed initial loop C and ad-
vecting velocity ﬁeld u. Under these circumstances, the
time series of Γ(C, t) will be a stochastic process. It was
proposed in [18] that the random time-series of circula-
tions should possess the “martingale property”:
′

′
hΓ(C, t)|Γ(C, s), s < t

′
i = Γ(C, t

t > t

(6)

),

.

That is, the conditional expectation of the circulation
in the future should be the last given value. This is a
natural statistical generalization of the Kelvin theorem
and, in fact, is a generalized form of the inviscid Euler
equations of motion for a turbulent ﬂuid [18].

A full test of these ideas will be quite diﬃcult and in-
volve, among other things, careful Lagrangian tracking
of the loops C(t). Here we check a somewhat weaker re-
sult. In Fig.3 we plot the conditional average circulation
ﬂux hKℓ(C)|Γ(C) = Γi from the 3d DNS as a function of
kc = π/ℓ, for a square loop with R = 64 and for various
values of the circulation level Γ. Unlike (6), this expec-
tation includes an average over the turbulent ensemble
of velocities u. The plot in Fig.3 shows that the sign of
Kℓ(C) is positively correlated with that of Γ(C), consis-
tent with the diﬀusive character of turbulent vortex-line
transport. Thus, the eﬀect of subscale modes at length-
scales < ℓ will be to reduce the magnitude of the circu-
lation, regardless of its sign. However, the conditional
average ﬂux for each value of Γ tends to zero as ℓ de-
creases through the inertial range. This is a true eﬀect
of the nonlinear dynamics, as illustrated by the dashed
line in Fig.3, which plots the expectation of the viscos-
C △uℓ·dx conditioned upon Γ = Γrms, as a
ity term ν
function of kc. Clearly viscous eﬀects are negligible over
H
the range considered. These results show that the Kelvin
theorem, although violated in individual realizations, is
still valid for 3d turbulence in some average sense.

Although the Kelvin theorem is not valid in the clas-

It is worth pointing out that the “circulation cascade”
veriﬁed for ﬂuid turbulence in this work is a classical ana-
logue of the “phase slip” phenomenon in superﬂuids, such
as 4He below the λ-point [24]. For example, consider the
decay of a superﬂuid ﬂow in a thin toroidal ring [25]. The
decay is mediated by the (thermal or quantum) nucle-
ation of quantized vortices which migrate out of the ring.
The passage of a vortex across the toroidal cross-section
induces by phase-slip a pulse of torque which decreases
the circulation around the ring. It was emphasized al-
ready by Anderson [24] that phase-slip occurs in superﬂu-
ids only because the quantized vortices are not material
objects moving with the ﬂuid. This is possible because
of the singular vortex core, where the superﬂuid density
drops to zero. The mechanism of turbulent circulation-
cascade that we have considered is quite similar. The
vortex lines in a turbulent ﬂow are also not material,
because singularities in the velocity ﬁeld allow them to
diﬀuse relative to the ﬂuid. Unlike in superﬂuids, this
is a continuous process, since classical vortices are not
quantized. There is also no need for the singularities to
be nucleated as ﬂuctuations, since they are everywhere
present in the turbulent ﬂow. Finally, we note that in
turbulence the diﬀusion of vortex-lines is not persistent
in scale, on average, and does not lead to irreversible de-
cay of circulations. As shown by Fig. 3, the partial eﬀect
of the modes adjacent in scale (ℓ ∼ R) leads to a mean
decay but, for ℓ ≪ R, the circulation is conserved on av-
erage. In this limit, time-reversal symmetry is restored.
The results in this work have many important impli-
cations. The turbulent transport of vortex-lines, per-
sistent as ℓ → 0, provides an inviscid mechanism for
vortex-reconnection and other changes of line topology.
However, a statistical form of the Kelvin theorem seems
to survive, which is crucial to justify Taylor’s vortex-
stretching mechanism of turbulent energy dissipation
[7–9]. Further research must clarify exactly to what ex-
tent conservation of circulation survives for turbulent so-
lutions of ﬂuid equations. Numerical studies must be
extended to Lagrangian tracking of advected loops C(t).
Theoretical investigations are required to take into ac-
count the presumably fractal nature of such loops [26].
Circulation-cascade should occur also in superﬂuid tur-
bulence [4], mediated in part by phase-slip of quan-
tized vortex-lines. Results similar to the present ones
may be developed also for conservation of magnetic ﬂux
(Alfv´en’s theorem [27]), important in magnetohydrody-
namic turbulence, and Ertel’s theorem [5] in geophysical
turbulence. The breakdown of Alfv´en’s theorem and the
“frozen-in” character of magnetic ﬂux-lines is of partic-
ular importance to account for the fast reconnection ob-
served in a variety of astrophysical turbulent ﬂows [28].

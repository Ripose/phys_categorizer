Governing Equations of Compressible Turbulence

Feng Wu
Department of Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering,
University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China

By the nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence, the governing equations of compressible turbu-
lence are given. The equations can hold at non-uniform points, in fact, are new kind of equations.
There are three choices. In the choice one, the second-order inﬁnitesimal quantities are neglected,
the closed equations about the point(monad)-average quantities are obtained. In other two choices,
the closed equations, in which the third-order inﬁnitesimal quantities are omitted, are given and
about the instantaneous, point-averaged and ﬂuctuant quantities.

In the paper [1], a new approach, the nonstandard picture of turbulence,

is presented. The essential idea in this picture is that a particle of ﬂuid in

a laminar ﬁeld is uniform wholly, but in turbulence a particle of ﬂuid is not

uniform and has interior structure. By the nonstandard analysis, this picture

can be described in mathematics. In the nonstandard analysis mathematics,

an inﬁnitesimal ε is a certain number(nonstandard number) rather than a

process, like the ordinary understanding, of tending to zero. A particle of ﬂuid

is called as a monad and the dimension of a monad is an inﬁnitesimal ε. By

the concepts of the nonstandard analysis, the deﬁnition of “diﬀerential” can

be given:

∂f
∂t

=

f (t + ε) − f (t)
ε

,

∂f
∂x

=

f (x + ε) − f (x)
ε

(1)

There is conceptual diﬀerence between this deﬁnition and that of the diﬀeren-

tial in the standard analysis theory.

1

In the nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence(NATT), there are six

assumptions. They are:

Assumption 1: Global turbulent ﬁeld is composed of standard points,

and every standard point is yet a monad. Each monad possesses

the internal structure, namely a monad is also composed of inﬁnite

nonstandard points (so called interior points of the monad).

Assumption 2: The ﬂows in monad ﬁelds are controlled by the Navier-

Stokes equations..

Assumption 3: Turbulent ﬁeld is continuous.

Assumption 4: When a measurement at any point (monad) (x1, x2, x3, t)

in a physical ﬁeld is taken, the operation of the measurement will

act randomly on one interior point (nonstandard point) of the point

(x1, x2, x3, t).

Assumption 5: When a measurement at any point (monad) of a tur-

bulent ﬁeld is made, the operation of the measurement will act in

equiprobability on various interior points of the monad. This as-

sumption is called the equiprobability assumption.

Assumption 6: In both the value and structure of function, physical

function, deﬁned on the interior points of the monads of a turbulent

ﬁeld, is very close between two monads, when these two monads are

inﬁnitely close to each other.

By virtue of these assumptions, the fundamental equations for incompress-

ible turbulence are obtained, also the closure problem is overcome in the paper

2

[1]. These equations are based on the deﬁnition (1) and new kind of equations,

which can hold at non-uniform points.

Now using the concepts mentioned above, we will give the governing equa-

tions for compressible turbulence. In compressible laminar ﬂows, the govern-

ing equations are not the Navier-Stokes equations. Therefore, Assumption 2

should be written as: The ﬂows in monad ﬁelds are controlled by the equations,

which govern the motion of laminar ﬂows.

The equations governing the motion of laminar ﬂows hold only at uniform

points. The nonstandard points in a monad are uniform, therefore the laminar

equations hold in monad ﬁelds.

In a monad ﬁeld, the governing equations of compressible ﬂows are as

follows.

Here µ is the dynamic viscosity, κ the thermal conductivity, T the absolute

temperature, δij the Kronecker delta.

The independent variables of all functions in these equations are

(x1, x2, x3, t, x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′). (x1, x2, x3, t) is the coordinates set up in global ﬁeld,

while (x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′) is the coordinates set up in a monad [1].

Still there are the relations:

Ui =

Ui + ui, P =

P + p,

ρ =

ρ + ρf , T =

T + Tf ,

e =

etc.

(9)

Here the lower-case ui, p and the quantities with index f are called as ﬂuctu-

e

ation quantities, which have the order of magnitude 0(ε).

Let “ ∼ ” express the average operation over (x′

2, x′

“ − ” over t′, etc., in a monad. Therefore,

The equations (11)-(13), in fact, are conservation equations of mass, mo-

mentum and energy, respectively, for global ﬁeld. By the relations (9), we can

obtained, from (11)-(13), the instantaneous and ﬂuctuant equations. Clearly

equation (11) can be written as

∂ρ
∂t

− ∂ρf
∂t

+

∂(ρUi)
∂xi

− ∂(ρUi)f
∂xi

= 0

After splitting the equation (14) into two parts in diﬀerent order of magnitude,

it follows that:

The ﬂuctuant continuity-equation in the order of magnitude 0(ε) is:

The instantaneous continuity-equation in the order of magnitude 0(1) is:

equations and energy-equation,

others. When the terms in order of magnitude ∼ 0(ε3) are, proximately,

neglected, those will be omitted.

Then the expansion of ρUi,

(ρUi) and (ρUi)f is, for example, given as

g
follows. And so are the similar others.

We should note that these equations in the three choices are new kind of

equations, which are based on the deﬁnition (1) and can hold at non-uniform

points too.

Obviously, the number of unknown quantities equals to that of equations,

therefore the equations in every Choice are closed. The instantaneous and ﬂuc-

tuant quantities are deﬁned on nonstandard points (x1, x2, x3, t, x′

1, x′

2, x′

3, t′).

However, the mean quantities are the point(monad)-average values. Yet the

average of the point-average values over certain time period or space range is

once again taken. And the results of the again average could be compared with

the measuring mean values over corresponding time period or space range.

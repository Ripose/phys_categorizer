Formation of Conic Cusps at the Surface of Liquid Metal

in Electric Field

The formation dynamics is studied for a singular proﬁle of a surface of an ideal

conducting ﬂuid in an electric ﬁeld. Self-similar solutions of electrohydrodynamic

equations describing the fundamental process of formation of surface conic cusps with
angles close to the Taylor cone angle 98.6◦ are obtained. The behavior of physical

quantities (ﬁeld strength, ﬂuid velocity, surface curvature) near the singularity is

established.

It is known [1, 2] that a ﬂat boundary of liquid metal becomes unstable in a strong elec-

tric ﬁeld. The development of instability results in conic cusp singularities, from which the

strengthened ﬁeld initiates emission processes [3, 4, 5, 6]. The description of these processes

is a key problem of the electrohydrodynamics of conducting ﬂuids with free surfaces; inter-

est in this problem is largely caused by the practical use of liquid-metal sources of charged

particles. The progress in this ﬁeld is associated with Taylor’s work [7], where it was demon-
strated that the surface electrostatic pressure PE for a cone with angle 98.6◦ depends on
the distance from its axis as r−1 and, hence, can be counterbalanced by the surface pressure
r−1. Since the force balance is violated at the cone apex, Taylor’s solution cannot

be treated as the exact solution of the problem of equilibrium conﬁguration of a charged

surface of conducting ﬂuid and only represents the possible asymptotic form at r

→ ∞
At the same time, it turned out that Taylor’s solution nicely describes the experimentally

.

observed surface shape before the instant of singularity formation. It was pointed out in

[3, 4, 5, 6] that the angle of incipient conic formations is close to the Taylor cone angle.

What is the reason for such a coincidence? One may assume that the mechanism for the
formation of conic cusps with an angle of 98.6◦ during a ﬁnite time is not directly associated

with the static Taylor model. A high reproducibility of experimental results and a weak

dependence of ﬂuid behavior at the ﬁnal instability stages on the geometry of the system

suggest that the behavior of ﬂuid near the singularity has a self-similar character.

Let us check the validity of this hypothesis. Consider the potential motion of an ideal

ﬂuid occupying the region bounded by free surface z = η(x, y, t). We will assume that the

vector of an external electric ﬁeld is directed along the z axis and equals E. The velocity

potential Φ of ﬂuid and the electric-ﬁeld potential ϕ satisfy the Laplace equations

We are interested in the dynamics of formation of a singular proﬁle for a conducting ﬂuid.

It is natural to assume that the electric ﬁeld near the cusp appreciably exceeds the external

ﬁeld; i.e.,

ϕ

E. In this case, the interface evolution is fully determined by the intrinsic

ﬁeld, which decreases with distance from the singularity. One can thus use the condition

instead of the ﬁeld uniformity condition (1). This agrees with the assumption about the

universal behavior of a ﬂuid in the formation of a singular surface proﬁle, because it allows

the ﬂuid motion near the singular point to be analyzed without regard for the particular

geometry of the problem. The applicability of condition (2) will be discussed below in more

detail after establishing some regularities for the dynamics of a conducting ﬂuid near the

singularity. Note that the possibility of secondary Taylor cones nucleating at the already

formed cones counts in favor of the universal mechanism of formation of conic cusps [4]. It is

clear from this example that ﬂuid “forgets” the boundary conditions at inﬁnity at the stage

of collapse.

Let us consider the most important case of the axially symmetric perturbation of the

surface. Taking into account that, after substitutions

For self-similar solutions (10)–(14), the surface proﬁle forms ﬁrst at the periphery and then
extends to the center r = z = 0 (the scale decreases as τ 2/3). This implies that the formation

of conic cusps at t = tc is described by those solutions to the set of Eqs. (15)–(21) which

provide conic asymptotic shape of the surface. In such a situation, the presence of asymptotic

solutions for which ˜η

and ﬂuid moves to the sink point R = 0 along the tangent to the surface (24). Since the

self-similar solution assumes its asymptotic form at τ

0, a conic cusp with Taylor angle

forms at time tc, and Eqs. (22)–(24) are the exact analytic solution of the problem. The
electric ﬁeld at the cusp increases as τ −1/3, the cusp growth velocity increases as τ −1/3, and
the cusp curvature increases as τ −2/3; i.e., these quantities become inﬁnite during a ﬁnite

time. At an appreciable distance from the singularity, the ﬁeld strength does not change,

and the velocity of ﬂuid linearly decreases with time and becomes zero at t = tc. The latter

fact allows one to explain qualitatively the mechanism of transition to the stationary regime

occurring for liquid-metal sources after the initiation of ﬁeld ion evaporation from the cusp

(stationary emitter models were developed in [8, 9]).

This analysis is only valid on the condition that the asymptotic solutions to the set of

partial diﬀerential Eqs. (15)–(21) have the form of Eqs. (22)–(24). To prove this statement,

one should construct the asymptotic expansion for the solutions at R

with leading

The coeﬃcients a2 and b2 can be determined from Eq. (19) and, correspondingly, Eq. (17),

where one should use the linear order of perturbation theory for small deviation of the surface

from the cone. In turn, the coeﬃcient c3 is found from Eq. (18), where one should take

into account the quadratic nonlinearity, etc. Thus, the expansion coeﬃcients are uniquely

determined by the zero-order coeﬃcients, i.e., by the parameter s of the problem, conﬁrming

the existence of solutions with the desired asymptotic form for the equations of motion. Note

that, if one sets s = 0 and, hence, Φ = 0, then Eqs. (15)–(21) coincide with the Taylor

equations in the problem of equilibrium conﬁguration of a charged liquid-metal surface.

However, one fails to construct asymptotic expansion (25)–(27) in this case.

7

Further, the solutions given by expansions (25)-(27) adequately describe the experimental

data if the condition ˜η <

s0˜r is satisﬁed, i.e., if the ﬂuid surface is positioned above the

−

asymptotic cone (see ﬁgure). Otherwise, the surface velocity would be directed in opposition

to the z axis. Let us check how this condition is fulﬁlled in the limit of large r. It follows

from the expansion obtained above for the surface shape that it deviates from the conic

shape in the direction speciﬁed by the sign of the c2 coeﬃcient. In our case, c2 < 0 (c2 > 0
for cone angles smaller than 78.5◦ and larger than 126.9◦), so that the amplitude of surface

perturbation should increase. Indeed, the evolution of the ﬂuid boundary away from the

singularity is determined by the leading terms of the expansion in small τ value,

η(r, t) =

s0r

c2

τ 4r−5,

|

from whence it follows that, when forming a conic cusp, the ﬂuid moves upwards, as is

expected from physical considerations.

Let us now consider the surface geometry for small ˜r, where expansion (27) diverges. For

the function ˜η to satisfy condition (21), the surface near the cone apex must be “rounded

oﬀ” (ﬁgure). Let us estimate the distance

from the cone apex to the ﬂuid surface.

Multiplying kinematic boundary condition (18) by 2π˜r/3 and integrating it over ˜r, one

where S stands for the ﬂuid surface ˜z = ˜η(˜r), V is the volume of a region bounded from

above by the conic surface ˜z =

s0˜r and from below by the S surface, and ∂n denotes the

−

derivative along the normal to S. The integral on the right-hand side of this expression is
equal to the ﬂuid velocity ﬂux through the surface. Since the function ˜Φ is harmonic, the
˜Φ through any closed surface is zero. This fact allows the ﬂux through

and, hence, V = πs(1 + cos θ0). Notice that the volume of a region bounded by the conic

Clearly, if the volume V is ﬁxed and the conditions ˜η(˜r) + s0˜r < 0 and ˜η˜r(˜r)

for any ˜r, the quantity

cannot exceed the cone height. That is, the inequality

connecting the characteristic spatial scale at small R with the asymptotic parameter s is

satisﬁed. Since the most probable value of h(s) corresponds to the maximum allowable value

s0 of the s constant, the following estimate is also valid:

˜η(0)

h(s0) = s0(3 + 3 cos θ0)1/3,

which does not involves the free parameter s.

Let us return to the question of the applicability of approximation (3)–(9) to the initial

equations of motion. As was pointed out above, condition (2) can be used instead of Eq. (1)

only if the external electric ﬁeld is weaker than the intrinsic cusp ﬁeld. This implies that the
inequality ϕ2

1 must be fulﬁlled. After the transition to the self-similar variables, it

is recast as

It is clear that for small τ (i.e., immediately before the collapse) this condition is fulﬁlled

In conclusion, let us discuss the possibility to form stronger singularities-cuspidal points.
It is known [12] that the ﬁeld mainly increases as r−1 upon approaching the apex of a thin
point and, hence, the electrostatic pressure PE increases as r−2. Since the surface pressure
changes as PS ∼

form, for which the curvature is inﬁnite, while the surface itself remains smooth. Therefore,

when assuming that the cuspidal points may appear, one arrives at a contradiction. This

gives grounds to assume that conic singularities are precisely those which are the generic

singular solutions of the electrohydrodynamic equations, so that the behavior of a charged

liquid-metal surface with cusps is described by self-similar solutions (10)–(21).

Note also that the results of this work can be extended to dielectric ﬂuids, in which the

conic cusps with angles depending on the dielectric constant can form in an electric ﬁeld

[13]. In addition, the approach developed in this work can be applied to the description

of the evolution of dimples sharpening in a ﬁnite time at a liquid helium surface (see, e.g.,

experimental work [14]). In my preceding work [15] devoted to the construction of exact

analytic solutions to the equations of motion for liquid helium in the presence of weak

Abstract. A new variational problem for upper bounds on the rate of energy dissipation in body-
forced shear ﬂows is formulated by including a balance parameter in the derivation from the Navier-Stokes
equations. The resulting min-max problem is investigated computationally, producing new estimates that
quantitatively improve previously obtained rigorous bounds. The results are compared with data from direct
numerical simulations.

1. Introduction

One of the outstanding open challenges for theoretical ﬂuid mechanics in the 21st century is to derive rigorous
results for turbulence directly from the fundamental equations of motion, the Navier-Stokes equations,
without imposing ad hoc assumptions or uncontrolled closures. Exact results are extremely rare, but it
is possible to derive rigorous and physically meaningful limits on some of the fundamental physical variables
quantifying turbulent dynamics and transport. The bulk rate of energy dissipation is one such quantity of
particular interest due to its production as a result of the turbulent cascade in the high Reynolds number
vanishing viscosity limit. The derivation of mathematically rigorous bounds on the energy dissipation rate,
and hence also a variety important quantities such as turbulent drag coeﬃcients and heat and mass transport
rates, has been a lively area of research in recent decades.

Beginning in the early 1960s, L.N. Howard and F.H. Busse pioneered the application of variational
approaches for the derivation of rigorous—and physically relevant—bounds on the dissipation rate for
In the 1990s, P. Constantin and the senior author of
boundary-driven ﬂows; see their reviews [20, 1].
this paper introduced the the so-called background ﬂow method [6, 7] based on an old idea by Hopf [19].
The background method was soon improved by Nicodemus et al [22] who introduced an additional variational
‘balance’ parameter, and by the late 1990s Kerswell [21] had shown that the background method equipped
with the balance parameter is dual to the Howard-Busse variational approach. Those theoretical techniques
have been applied to many ﬂows driven by boundary conditions, including shear ﬂows and a variety of
thermal convection problems [3, 4, 12, 5, 11, 26, 25].

Attention has recently turned as well to the derivation of quantitative variational bounds on the energy

rate per unit mass ǫ is proportional to the power required to maintain a statistically steady turbulent state.
While body forces may be diﬃcult to realize in experiments, they are easily implemented computationally
and are the standard method of driving for direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent ﬂows.

Childress et al [2] applied a background-type method to body-forced ﬂows in a periodic domain, focusing
on dissipation estimates in terms of the magnitude of the applied force.
In dimensionless variables they
bounded ǫ in units of (F 3ℓ)1/2, where F is the amplitude of the applied force per unit mass and ℓ is the
(lowest) length scale in the force. The estimates were given in terms of the natural dimensionless control
parameter, the Grashof number, Gr := F ℓ3/ν2, where ν is the kinematic viscosity. In practice, ǫ is often
measured in inviscid units of U 3/ℓ as a function of the Reynolds number Re = U ℓ/ν, where U is a relevant
velocity scale—an emergent quantity when the force is speciﬁed a priori. In both cases the dissipation is
bounded on one side by that of the associated Stokes ﬂow [17]. When bounds are expressed in terms of Gr,
the Stokes limit is an upper bound, whereas when the estimates are in terms of Re it is the lower limit.

Foias [13] was the ﬁrst to derive an upper bound on

in terms Re, but with an inappropriate prefactor dependence on the aspect ratio α = L/ℓ, where L is the
system volume, generally an independent variable from ℓ (see also [15, 16]). That analysis was recently
reﬁned by Foias and one of the authors of this paper [9] to an upper estimate of the form

where the coeﬃcients c1 and c2 are independent of F, ℓ, ν and α, depending only on the “shape” of the
(square integrable) body force. (This in consistent with much of the conventional wisdom about the cascade
in homogeneous isotropic turbulence theory [18, 10, 14] as well as with wind tunnel measurements [27]
and DNS data [28].) Most recently, that approach was developed further by deriving a mini-max variational
problem on the time averaged dissipation rate for a particular domain geometry [8]. Moreover, the variational
problem was solved exactly at high Reynolds numbers to produce estimates on the asymptotic behavior of
the energy dissipation as a function of Re including the optimal prefactor.

In this paper we extend the results in [8] by introducing a balance parameter c, the analog of the
variational parameter introduced by Nicodemus et al [22, 23, 24] for the background method. This parameter
controls a balance between the quantity being bounded, the manifestly positive deﬁnite energy dissipation

rate proportional to the L2 norm of the rate of strain tensor, and the indeﬁnite quantity derived from
the power balance that is ultimately being extremized. Speciﬁcally we consider the ﬂow of a viscous
incompressible ﬂuid bounded by two parallel planes with free-slip boundary conditions at the walls and
periodic boundary conditions in the other two directions. The ﬂow is maintained by a time-independent
body force in the direction parallel to the walls. First we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations in the case
c = 0 (where the variational principle coincides with the one in [8]) and solve them numerically at ﬁnite Re.
The full (c > 0) Euler-Lagrange equations are quite complicated but they can also be solved numerically by
using Newton method with the c = 0 solution as an initial guess.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the problem and its variational

In Section 4 we collect our numerical
results, and in Section 5 we summarize the results discussing the challenges of this approach and future
directions for research.

2. Statement of the problem

2.1. Notation

Consider a viscous incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid moving between two parallel planes located at y = 0 and
y = ℓ. Denote x the stream-wise direction and z be the span-wise direction. The velocity vector ﬁeld satisﬁes
free-slip boundary conditions at the two planes bounding the ﬂow. We impose periodic boundary conditions
in the other two directions. The motion of the ﬂuid is induced by a steady body force f along the x axis
varying only in the y direction.

The motion of the ﬂuid is governed by Navier-Stokes equation

Here p(x, t) is the pressure ﬁeld, and Re := Urmsℓ
is the Reynolds number, where Urms is the root-mean
square velocity of the ﬂuid. The problem is non-dimensionalized by choosing the unit of length to be ℓ and
the unit for time to be ℓ/Urms. Let
stand for the space-time average. With this choice of units the velocity
of the ﬂuid u(x, t) = (u, v, w) is space-time L2-normalized to 1:

2.3. Mini-max upper bounds for β

A variational bound on β may be obtained by ﬁrst maximizing the right-hand side of (8) over all unit-
normalized divergence-free vector ﬁelds u that satisfy the boundary conditions (5), and then minimizing
H 1([0, 1]) satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Then
over all choices of test functions Ψ
any solution of Navier-Stokes equation will have energy dissipation rate β bounded from above by

which is achieved for the choice of test function Ψ = sign Φ. While sign Φ is not in H 1([0, 1]), it can
be approximated arbitrarily closely (in the sense of pointwise convergence) by a sequence of functions in
H 1([0, 1]).

In [8], the authors considered test functions Ψδ which are “linearly molliﬁed” approximations of sign Φ,
i.e., continuous piecewise linear functions approximating sign Φ by replacing the jumps of sign Φ by lines of
1 and 1 (see Figure 1 in [8]). Finally, for ﬁnite Re, it was shown in [8] that

Now we will obtain bounds on the energy dissipation by applying a mini-max procedure to the functional in
the right-hand side above.

The parameter c provides more constraint on the variational procedure than the case considered in [8].
The space-time average of
c < 0 so that for a velocity ﬁeld with a large gradient
(like the one of the form (11) when gk tends to a Dirac δ function), the right-hand side of (12) will become

While performing the maximization procedure we have to incorporate two explicit constraints on the
velocity vector ﬁelds: the unit-norm condition (3) and incompressibility (2). The former one is easy to
implement by adding a term with Lagrange multiplier λ which is a number (i.e., does not depend on x and
t). Incompressibility, however, requires introducing a Lagrange multiplier (a “pressure”) that is a pointwise
function which makes the variational problem very diﬃcult to analyze. So instead we will restrict the class
of velocity ﬁelds u over which we maximize to ﬁelds that are automatically divergence-free.

The functional incorporating the normalization constraint is

Note that the vector ﬁeld u deﬁned in (14) is automatically divergence-free.

This class of velocity ﬁelds u (14) is restrictive, but in our opinion it constitutes a physically reasonable
ansatz. It has been observed for plane parallel shear ﬂows that the ﬁrst modes to lose absolute stability have
only cross-stream and span-wise variation with no dependence on the stream-wise coordinate x. Moreover,
the parameter k in (14) can take any real value, so this does not impose any restriction on the wavelength of
the pattern in span-wise (z) direction. Note also that the case of very high Reynolds numbers corresponds
to the choice c = 0 (see (13)), and in this case the family (14) will tend to the family (11) which we know
achieves the upper bound on the dissipation at inﬁnite Re. All these considerations make the choice of

a small number of parameters, and minimize over those parameters and c. We will take a 1-parameter family

a “boundary layer”.

Let β(Re, δ, c, k) be the mini-max upper bound for the turbulent energy dissipation as a function of the
Reynolds number Re, the parameter δ of the family Ψδ, the balance parameter c, and the wavenumber k.
Deﬁne β∗(Re, δ, c) to be the maximum over k of β(Re, δ, c, k), and k∗(Re, δ, c) to be the value of k for which

The boundary conditions of the Euler-Lagrange equations naturally suggest the use of Chebyshev
polynomials as interpolants to implement a pseudo-spectral scheme [29] to solve these equations. The
Matlab diﬀerentiation matrix suite [30] simpliﬁes the implementation by providing routines to discretize and
represent diﬀerentiation operators as matrices. Diﬀerentiation of a function then becomes multiplication of
the diﬀerentiation matrix with the vector of the function values at those Chebyshev nodes. However, the
discretized equations are still nonlinear in the c
= 0 case. We started with the c = 0 equations which are
solvable as a linear eigenvalue problem (20). Then the standard Newton’s method was applied to these
solutions and iterated to solve the nonlinear equations (16a), (16b), (16c). The Jacobian matrices needed in
the Newton’s method were computed by a simple forward diﬀerence scheme. Throughout all computations,
128 and 64 Chebyshev nodes were used (the diﬀerences between the results for these choices of number of
nodes did not exceed 10−

7).

To illustrate the typical geometry of the ﬂow, in Figures 1 and 2, we show the three coordinate projections
and the 3-dimensional view of typical integral lines (i.e., solutions of ( ˙x, ˙y, ˙z) = (u, v, w) for (u, v, w) given
by (14)) of the maximizing ﬂow ﬁeld for Re = 50 and Re = 1000, respectively. The values of the parameters
δ, c, k, for the ﬁelds shown are the ones that give the optimal bound, βb(Re) given by (26).

In Figure 4 we show the bound on the dissipation β for Re = 50 as a function of the balance parameter
c for diﬀerent values of the span-wise wavenumber k; the data presented have been obtained with Ψδ with
δ = 0.04. The ﬁgure illustrates the general behavior of β as a function of k and c – namely, for small k, the
value of β increases with c, while for larger k, β decreases with c. Clearly, the family of lines in the ﬁgure has
an envelope – this envelope is the graph of the function β∗(50, 0.04, c) (25). Having obtained the envelope,
we ﬁnd the minimum value of β∗(50, 0.04, c) – this is the mini-max value we are looking for; this point is
labeled with βb in Figures 3 (where it is the saddle point) and 4.

5. Concluding remarks

We have derived new bounds on the energy dissipation rate for an example of body-force driven ﬂow in
a slippery channel. The fundamental improvement over previous results came from the application of the
balance parameter in the variational formulation of the bounds, together with numerical solution of the
Euler-Lagrange equations for the best estimate.

In Figure 7 the results of this analysis are compared with the direct numerical simulations of the
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations ﬁrst reported in [8]. Over the Reynolds number range 100–1000
where the data lie, the best bounds derived here, using the balance parameter and minimization over the
(restricted) family of multiplier functions Ψδ, result in a quantitative improvement over the previous rigorous
estimates. We observe that the measured dissipation is a factor of 3 to 4 below the bound, which should be
considered nontrivial given the a priori nature of the estimates derived here. Presumably a full optimization

over possible multiplier functions Ψ would result in a further lowering of the estimate at lower values of
Re, producing a bound that intersects the lower Stokes bound right at the energy stability limit (which we
compute to be at Re = 2π). We note from Figure 5 that the bounds computed with Φδ tend to agree with
those computed using Φ = Ψ at lower values of Re, indicating that both trial functions are about the same
“distance” from the true optimal multiplier.

with a diﬀerence vanishing

There are several directions in which this line of research could be continued. One is to develop more
reliable and accurate analytical methods for estimating the best bounds at ﬁnite Re. This would probably
1 which could lead to more general
involve asymptotic approximations for small but ﬁnite values of Re−
applications for other variational problems as well. Another direction would be to develop methods to
determine the true optimal multiplier function at ﬁnite Re. The motivation there would largely be as a
point of principle, to demonstrate that the full min-max procedure can indeed be carried out—at least for
simple set-ups such as those considered here. Finally, going beyond the simple sin πy forcing considered in
this paper there remains the question, ﬁrst posed in [8], as to the connection between the optimal multiplier
and the true mean proﬁle realized in direct numerical simulations. Speciﬁcally, the question is whether there
is a sensible correspondence between the shape of the optimal multiplier and the mean proﬁle for general
force shapes. The idea is that the optimal multiplier contains information about the extreme ﬂuctuations
that might be realized in a turbulent ﬂow, and some of those features may correlate with the statistical
properties of the ﬂows.

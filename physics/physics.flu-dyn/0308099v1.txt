Weak Turbulent Kolmogorov Spectrum for Surface Gravity Waves

We study the long-time evolution of gravity waves on deep water exited by the stochastic external
force concentrated in moderately small wave numbers. We numerically implement the primitive
Euler equations for the potential ﬂow of an ideal ﬂuid with free surface written in canonical variables,
using expansion of the Hamiltonian in powers of nonlinearity of up to fourth order terms.

We show that due to nonlinear interaction processes a stationary energy spectrum close to
|k| ∼ k−7/2 is formed. The observed spectrum can be interpreted as a weak-turbulent Kolmogorov
spectrum for a direct cascade of energy.

Kolmogorov was born in 1903. Now, in the year of
his centenary, his greatness is obvious not only for pure
and applied mathematicians. All physicists appreciate
his pioneering works on powerlike cascade spectra in tur-
bulence of the incompressible ﬂuid [1].
It is obvious
now that cascade processes, similar to the Kolmogorov
cascade of energy, play a very important role in many
diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics, such as nonlinear optics [2],
plasma physics [3], hydrodynamics of superﬂuid He4, and
so forth.

In all these cases the physical situations are similar.
There is an ensemble of slowly decaying, weakly nonlin-
ear waves in a medium with dispersion. Such systems
have to be described statistically. However this is not
traditional statistical mechanics, because the ensembles
are very far from the thermodynamic equilibrium. Never-
theless, one can develop a systematic approach for statis-
tical study of weakly nonlinear waves. This is the theory
of weak (or wave) turbulence [4]. The main tools here
are the kinetic equations for squared wave amplitudes.
These equations describe the nonlinear resonant interac-
tion processes, taking place in the wave systems. Like
in the turbulence in incompressible ﬂuid, these processes
lead to the formation of constants of motion cascades (en-
ergy, wave action, momentum etc.) along the k
space.
In isotropic systems it might be either a direct cascade
of energy from small to large wave numbers or an inverse
In
cascade of wave action to small wave numbers [5].
an anisotropic system the situation could be much more
complicated [6].

The brilliant conjecture of Kolmogorov still is a hy-
pothesis, supported by ample experimental evidence. On
the contrary, the existence of powerlike Kolmogorov spec-
tra, describing cascades in weak turbulence, is a rigorous
mathematical fact. These spectra are the exact solutions
of the stationary homogeneous kinetic equation, com-
pletely diﬀerent from the thermodynamic Rayley-Jeans
solutions.

phase stochasticity and the absence of coherent struc-
tures. This is the reason why justiﬁcation of weak tur-
bulent theory is an urgent and important problem.

This justiﬁcation can be done by a direct numerical so-
lution of the primitive dynamic equation describing the
wave ensemble. In pioneering works by Majda, McLaugh-
lin and Tabak [7] it was done for the 1-D wave system.
The results obtained by these authors are not easily in-
terpreted. In some cases they demonstrate Kolmogorov-
type spectra, in other cases — power spectra with essen-
tially diﬀerent exponents.

In article [8] deviation from weak turbulent theory was
explained by the role of coherent structures (solitons,
quasysolitons and collapses). If a 1-D system is free from
coherent structures, weak-turbulent spectra are observed
with a good deal of evidence [9, 10]

In spite of their heuristic value, the 1-D models so far
developed have no direct physical application. Real phys-
ical systems, where wave turbulence is realized, are at
least 2-dimensional. The most natural and important
examples are capillary and gravity waves on deep wa-
ter. Weak-turbulent theory of capillary waves was de-
veloped by Zakharov and Filonenko in 1967 [11], who
found that the correlation function of evolution has to
k−19/4. This result was supported by lab-
be <
oratory experiments, performed independently by three
groups (in UCLA [12], Niels Bohr Institute [13] and
the Solid State Physics Institute in Chernogolovka, Rus-
sia [14, 15]). The spectrum k−19/4 was obtained by a
direct numerical simulation of Euler equation for incom-
pressible ﬂuid with free surface by Pushkarev and Za-
kharov [16, 17, 18].

The most interesting example of 2-D wave ensembles
demonstrating weak-turbulent cascades is a system of
gravity waves on the surface of deep water. We sure that
the weak-turbulent theory of these waves is key to under-
standing the processes in a wind-driven sea. However, we
do not concentrate on this point in our article.

Nevertheless, the case is not closed. The weak tur-
bulent theory itself is based on some assumptions, like

Our initial goal was to reproduce (and emulate), for
gravity waves, the work which was done by Pushkarev

and Zakharov [16] for capillary waves. One has to ex-
pect that this is a more diﬃcult problem, because the
leading process in capillary waves is a three-wave inter-
action, while for gravity waves the lowest order process
is four-wave interaction.

Attempts to perform direct numerical simulations of
potential ﬂow in an ideal ﬂuid with a free surface were
made by several authors [19]. Only in one article authors
paid interest to Kolmogorov-type weak-turbulent spec-
tra [20]. Authors of this paper observed the formation of
Kolmogorov tails in the process of time evolution of an
artiﬁcially cut-oﬀ JONSWAP energy spectrum [21]. The
results of presented article agree with the results of [20]
completely, however we would like to stress a diﬀerence.
In our work we study a forced turbulence, exited by
external sources, posed in moderately low wave numbers.
We show that growth of wave energy due to this forcing
is arrested by the nonlinear resonant four-wave processes
which leads to the formation of powerlike Kolmogorov
spectrum in the transparency domain. In this sense our
article is a direct numerical conﬁrmation of the weak-
turbulent theory for surface gravity waves.

Theoretical Background — So we study the potential
ﬂow of an ideal inviscid incompressible ﬂuid with the ve-
locity potential φ = φ(x, y, z; t)

the k-space supports of D~k and F~k are separated by the
inertial interval, where the Kolmogorov-type solution can
be recognized.

We study numerically the quasi stationary solution of
equations (4). According to the theory of weak turbu-

The equations (4) were numerically simulated in peri-
odic domain 2π
2π. The size of the grid was chosen
512 points. Gravity acceleration g was equal
at 512
to one. Parameters of the damping and pumping in (6)
were the following: kp1 = 5, kp2 = 10, kd = 100. Thus
the inertial interval is equal to a decade.

In the simulations we paid special attention to the
problems which could ”damage” the calculations. First
of all, it is the ”bottle neck” phenomenon at the bound-
ary between inertial interval and dissipation region. This
eﬀect is very fast, but can be eﬀectively suppressed by a
proper choice of damping value γ2 in the case of moder-
ate pumping values F0. The second problem is the ac-
cumulation of ”condensate” in low wave numbers. This
mechanism for the case of capillary waves was examined
in detail in [23]. Buildup of condensate can be overcome
by simple adaptive damping in the small wave numbers.
After some time the system reaches the stationary state,
where the balance between pumping and damping takes
place. In this state an important parameter is the ratio
of nonlinear energy to the linear one (H1 + H2)/H0.

For example, for the external force F0 = 2

10−4, γ1 =
10−3, γ2 = 665 the level of nonlinearity was equal to
10−3. The Hamiltonian as a function

The spectrum of surface elevation appears to be power-
like in the essential part of inertial interval, where the
inﬂuence of pumping and damping was small. This spec-
trum is shown in Fig. 2.

One can estimate the exponent of the spectrum. It is
worth saying that an alternative spectrum was proposed
earlier by Phillips [24]. That power-like spectrum is due
to wave breaking mechanism and gives us a surface ele-
k−4. Compensated spectra are
vation correlator as Ik ∼
shown in Fig. 3.
It seems to be the evidence that the
Kolmogorov spectrum predicted by weak turbulence the-
ory better ﬁts the results of the numerical experiment.

The quality of the result (closeness to the <

In the end we would like to mention that for a diﬀerent
pumping level surface elevation spectra diﬀer only due
to the Kolmogorov constant C in (5), as clearly seen in
Fig. 5.

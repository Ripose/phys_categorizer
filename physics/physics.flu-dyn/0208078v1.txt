Abstract. – We analyze the eﬀect of frequency on the width of a single ﬁnger displacing a
viscoelastic ﬂuid. We derive a generalized Darcy’s law in the frequency domain for a linear
viscoelastic ﬂuid ﬂowing in a Hele Shaw cell. This leads to an analytic expression for the
dynamic permeability that has maxima which are several orders of magnitude larger than the
static permeability. We then follow an argument of de Gennes [12] to obtain the smallest
possible ﬁnger width when viscoelasticity is important. Using this, and a conservation law, we
obtain a lowest bound for the width of a single ﬁnger displacing a viscoelastic ﬂuid. Our results
indicate that when a small amplitude signal of the frequency that maximizes the permeability is
overimposed to a constant pressure drop, gigantic variations are obtained for the ﬁnger width.

Many problems associated with oil, plastic, and chemical industries involve the response of
a ﬂuid in a porous medium to a frequency dependent pressure drop. Laboratory experiments
have shown for example that ultrasonic vibrations can considerably increase the rate of ﬂow
of a liquid through a porous medium [1]. A useful way to describe such frequency-dependent
processes is through a dynamic permeability function [2]. Expressions for the dynamic per-
meability of Newtonian ﬂuids were obtained long ago for deformable and isotropic porous
media [3]. More recently, an enhancement of several orders of magnitude in the dynamic per-
meability was found for the case of Maxwellian ﬂuids [4]. Many other problems in the same
industries, involve the displacement of a viscoelastic ﬂuid by a second ﬂuid of lower viscosity.
The dramatic enhancement found for the dynamic permeability of a Maxwell ﬂuid [4] ﬂowing
in a tube, immediately suggests that similar dramatic eﬀects might happen in problems of
ﬂow involving more than one ﬂuid.

The viscous ﬁngering problem has been historically very important in the area of morphol-
ogy of interfaces out of equilibrium [5] and has been a model system to describe displacement
of viscous ﬂuids in porous media. The viscous ﬁngering problem is the prediction of the shape
of the ﬂuid interface in a two-phase ﬂow conﬁned in a Hele-Shaw cell [6] which consists of a
pair of glass plates parallel to each other separated by a small gap. A viscous ﬂuid occupies the
space between the plates and it is pushed by a second ﬂuid whose viscosity is relatively low.
When the ﬂuid is pushed laterally, the experiment is said to take place in a linear cell. When

the ﬂuid is injected through a hole made in one of the plates forming the cell, the experiment
is said to take place in a radial cell. Both the linear and the radial geometry have been studied
extensively. The interface between the ﬂuids is unstable and the structures that are formed
when the interface destabilizes are called ﬁngers. This is the so called Saﬀman-Taylor insta-
bility [7]. Recently, viscous ﬁngering experiments have been made with non-Newtonian ﬂuids.
Some of these experiments have used clays [8], polymer solutions [9,10] and lyotropic lamellar
phases [11]. Non-Newtonian ﬂuids diﬀer widely in their physical properties, with diﬀerent ﬂu-
ids exhibiting a range of diﬀerent properties, from plasticity and elasticity to shear thickening
and shear thinning. Several studies have been made, both theoretically and experimentally in
order to diﬀerentiate between the eﬀects caused by diﬀerent properties [10, 12–14].

In this letter we analyze the eﬀect of frequency on the width of a single ﬁnger displacing
a viscoelastic ﬂuid. To start, we derive a generalized Darcy’s law in the frequency domain for
a linear viscoelastic ﬂuid ﬂowing in a Hele Shaw cell. This leads to an analytic expression for
the dynamic permeability that in agreement with results in other geometries [4] has maxima
which are several orders of magnitude larger than the static permeability. We then follow an
argument of de Gennes [12] to obtain the smallest possible ﬁnger width when viscoelasticity
is important. Using this, and a conservation law, we obtain a lowest bound for the width
of a single ﬁnger displacing a viscoelastic ﬂuid. What we ﬁnd is that, when there is a small
amplitude signal of the frequency that maximizes the permeability, overimposed to a constant
pressure drop, gigantic variations are obtained for the ﬁnger width, that is, tiny perturbations
in the pressure drop produce dramatic eﬀects on the amplitude of the ﬁnger width.

We start our study taking a Maxwell ﬂuid, which is the simplest model of a linear vis-
coelastic ﬂuid, and linearize the equation governing the ﬂow. In the frequency domain this
equation is [4]

Figure 1 shows the real part of the normalized permeability K(ω)/K(0) versus the fre-
quency for both a Maxwell ﬂuid and a Newtonian ﬂuid. The ﬁgure shows that for a Newtonian
ﬂuid the permeability is a monotonically decreasing function of frequency. For a Maxwell ﬂuid
on the other hand, there are frequencies in which there are resonances which give peaks for
the permeability. For typical values of density, viscosity, plate spacing and relaxation time in
the common literature of Hele-Shaw problems, we ﬁnd that this permeability can be two or
three orders of magnitude larger than the Newtonian permeability, this is because the behav-
ior of the ﬂow at such frequencies is dominated by the elastic properties of the ﬂuid. What

Fluid with a relaxation time tr = 6s, the dotted line for a Newtonian ﬂuid. For both lines the viscosity
η = 0.7p, the density ρ = 1g/cm3 and the spacing between the plates L = 2mm

this result means is that if we displace the viscous ﬂuid at the frequency that maximizes the
permeability, the ﬂuid will ﬂow with the least possible resistance. We ﬁnd that the frequency
which gives the largest permeability is of the order of ten Hertz.

Figure 2 shows how the maximum of the real part of the permeability shifts towards
higher frequencies when the viscosity is increased. So, the more viscous the ﬂuid, the higher
the frequency of the necessary pumping to minimize the resistance to ﬂow.

ﬂuid. In particular, we analyze the case of a single ﬁnger with a time dependent velocity U (t)
propagating into the viscous ﬂuid. We call λ(t) the ﬁnger width. It is worth emphasizing that
we are not considering a steady state. Both U and λ depend on time (1).

The quantity U/λ gives a characteristic frequency. The viscoelastic ﬂuid has a character-
istic time tr which in the case of a Maxwell ﬂuid is given by tr = η/G, G being the rigidity
modulus of the viscous ﬂuid. When U/λ > 1/tr the viscoelastic ﬂuid behaves like a solid
and there is no Saﬀman-Taylor instability. The allowed wavelengths should all correspond to
U/λ < 1/tr [12]. Therefore, the smallest possible ﬁnger width should be such that

Conservation of matter implies that

From equations (4) and (5) we can relate the ﬁnger width λ(t) and the tip velocity U (t) with
the velocity at the extreme of the cell V∞(t) as

and

Experimentally, the parameter that can be controlled is the pressure diﬀerence at the

extremes of the cell. So, given ∆p(t), we can make the following calculations:

In order for ﬁngers to exist, the pressure diﬀerence should be at any moment positive.
Simple oscillatory signals are not possible since the instability will exist for only half of the
period. So we are thinking, for example, in signals that are overimposed to pressure drops
that are large enough to destabilize the interface.

We consider the simple case of an oscillatory ﬁnger. Suppose we impose a pressure diﬀer-

ence of the form

∆p(t) = po + pae

Here λss and Uss are deﬁned in terms of V ss
∞ trough (6) and (7). What it is interesting to
note, is that the behavior is totally diﬀerent if the displaced viscous ﬂuid is Newtonian or
viscoelastic. For Newtonian ﬂuids, the ratio K(ω0)
is always small or equal to one and the
K(0)
variations in the width of the ﬁnger are small. In the other hand, for viscoelastic ﬂuids, the
ratio K(ω0)
K(0) can be several orders of magnitude larger than in the Newtonian case. Hence, if
the imposed signal has a frequency ω0 such that it maximizes the dynamic permeability, and
therefore the ratio K(ω0)
K(0) , a small amplitude in the oscillatory part of the pressure signal, will
result in gigantic variations in the amplitude of both the ﬁnger velocity and the ﬁnger width.
A word of caution is needed, since when one does not consider surface tension the ﬁnger
width and the velocity at the ﬁnger tip are not independent. It is worth noticing that since
the surface tension has a stabilizing eﬀect for small wavelengths any consideration of surface
tension would give ﬁngers wider or equal to the lowest bound that we are dealing with in the
present work.

We are not solving the selection problem, in order to do it and to compute ﬁnger shapes,
the problem should be solved as in references [7, 15]. Nevertheless the main result of the
present paper should remain. That is, small variations in the pressure drop at a frequency
that maximizes the permeability, will result in gigantic variations of the ﬁnger width.

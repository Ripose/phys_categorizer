Abstract

Wave resistance is the drag force associated to the emission of waves by a
moving disturbance at a ﬂuid free surface.
In the case of capillary-gravity
waves it undergoes a transition from zero to a ﬁnite value as the speed of
the disturbance is increased. For the ﬁrst time an experiment is designed
in order to obtain the wave resistance as a function of speed. The eﬀect of
viscosity is explored, and a magnetic ﬂuid is used to extend the available
range of critical speeds. The threshold values are in good agreement with the
proposed theory. Contrary to the theoretical model, however, the measured
wave resistance reveals a non monotonic speed dependence after the threshold.

When an object is moved at the free surface of a ﬂuid, it experiences a drag force
which physically originates from: (a) bulk dissipation in a viscous boundary layer for low
Reynolds numbers, and in the turbulent wake for high Reynolds numbers; (b) the emission
of capillary-gravity surface waves. Such waves remove momentum from the perturbating
object to inﬁnity. The associated force that the object experiences is called wave resistance.
For the convenient moderate speeds on which we focus in this paper it may overcome the
bulk dissipation type drag.

Wave resistance has been studied for more than a century in the case of pure gravity
waves [1], mainly because this topic has obvious naval applications [2].
In this case the
variation of the wave resistance R with the speed V follows two r´egimes. A critical velocity

The case of capillary-gravity waves has been theoretically treated in a recent work of
Rapha¨el and de Gennes [4]. Such waves are generated when the size of the perturbating
object is small compared to the capillary wavelength λc = 2π(σ/ρg)1/2, where σ is the surface
tension of the free air-ﬂuid interface and ρ the density of the ﬂuid. The dispersive properties
of capillary-gravity waves are such as there exists a minimum phase speed Vc = (4σg/ρ)1/4
at which waves are able to propagate. Since the pattern is stationary in the reference frame
of the moving object, no wave can be emitted for V < Vc [5], and therefore there is no wave
resistance in that case. As it has been shown in [4], the wave resistance experiences a ﬁnite
jump Rc at V = Vc and increases above Vc. The system is thus supposed to undergo a
discontinuous bifurcation.

In order to check these theoretical predictions it is necessary to vary Vc by means of ρ
and σ variations. By adding a surfactant to water, σ may be easily chosen between say
20 and 73 mN/m. Consequently Vc will merely vary from 17 cm/s to 23 cm/s. A more
eﬃcient control parameter is thus needed. We here show that the action of a magnetic
ﬁeld on a magnetic ﬂuid provides a means to tune the critical velocity from its maximum
value V H=0
= (4σg/ρ)1/4 down to 0. Using a magnetic ﬂuid, along with other regular
ﬂuids of diﬀerent viscosities, we perform R(V ) measurements, as the problem has not been
experimentally treated yet.

In a regular ﬂuid, the wave emission process is controlled by the dispersion equation of
capillary-gravity surface waves, ω2 = gk + σk3/ρ, where ω is the circular frequency and k
the modulus of the wave vector. The condition for stationarity of the wave pattern in the
frame of reference of the moving object is ω = kV cos θ ,where θ is the angle between the
speed and wave vectors. Thus we obtain the following equation (kc =

wavevector):

where k+(θ) and k−(θ) are the two roots of Eq. (1). This formula remains valid as long as
the characteristic size of the pressure distribution in experiments is much smaller than the
capillary wavelength. In those conditions, close and above the threshold, the wave resistance
has a ﬁnite value Rc = p2kc/2√2σ and increases monotonically with speed (see inset of Fig.
1 and the uppermost curve in Fig. 4).

In order to measure R(V ) for the various ﬂuids, they are placed into a circular channel
dug into a Teﬂon covered aluminum dish. The latter is ﬁxed to a shaft and rotated at
constant rate, thus simulating a steady ﬂow for the ﬂuid. The radius of the channel is
20 cm, its width is 2 cm. A 4 cm wide channel is also used, showing no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in the experimental results. The depth of the ﬂuid is usually more than 1 cm, ensuring the
validity of the inﬁnite depth approximation.

The disturbing object consists of a vertical bronze wire (radius r = 0.2 mm) whose tip
just touches the surface of the ﬂuid (the wire is wetted by a few tenths of millimeters of
ﬂuid). The deﬂection of the wire is proportional to the horizontal force exerted on its free

optical sensor. The calibration of the sensor is obtained by tilting the base to which the
wire is attached. A more detailed description of the measuring method will be published
later.

Though no theory includes 3D viscous eﬀects so far, we measure the wave resistance
for diﬀerent viscosities. To this purpose several mixtures of water and glycerol are used:
the surface tension σ and the densities ρ of the mixtures are very close to one another (see
Table 1) so that the impact of viscosity alone may be monitored in our experiments. The
viscosities are measured with a standard Poiseuille viscometer.

Fig.1 displays the variation of the experimental drag Rexp as a function of speed for the
various mixtures. All the measurements are obtained by increasing and then decreasing the
speed: there is no hysteresis. We may note that:

(a) There is a critical velocity at which the measured drag is discontinuous. That point
validates an important feature of the Rapha¨el and de Gennes’ theory [4]. Besides, it has
been checked that the drag discontinuity occurs at the very speed at which the wave pattern
develops. The measured critical velocity Vc is 23
0.5 cm/s for pure water. It corresponds
to a surface tension interval of [65.1;77.7] mN/m into which lies the tabulated value of
pure water surface tension 72.75 mN/m at 20 ◦C. For water/glycerol mixtures we obtained
Vc ≈
22.5 cm/s, that is compatible within experimental error bars with the surface tension
of the mixtures (around 70 mN/m).

(b) The experimental drag is not null below the critical velocity, all the more since the
viscosity is high. The viscous drag Rdrag that is exerted over the immersed wire must be
added to the wave resistance R to account for the measured drag Rexp. At a speed of 10
cm/s, the Reynolds number based on the approximate length of the wetted part of the wire

viscous drag is indeed proportional to h; it can be seen in Fig.1 (dotted lines) that it is
also proportional to V , at least for moderate enough speeds. The linear Rdrag dependence
on viscosity η is harder to assess because it is impossible to impose exactly the same h

subtraction of the viscous drag Rdrag for each sample.
It is this quantity that has to be
compared with the theoretical expression (2) (full line in the inset). It is clear from the inset
that a pretransitional eﬀect takes place, as the measured drag sharply increases just below
the threshold (the higher the viscosity, the stronger the eﬀect). A recent model [8] for 2D
viscous wave resistance predicts such a feature.

(c) The amplitude of the wave resistance discontinuity at Vc compares well with the theory.
Assuming a perfect wetting of the wire by the ﬂuid, the total force acting on the ﬂuid is
p = 2πrσ (r is the radius of the wire). Thus an estimate of the wave resistance at the
threshold is given by Rc = π2r2√2ρgσ. A comparison between expected values and what is
observed is given in Table I. The discrepancy is partially due to the imperfect wetting of
the ﬂuid on the wire, which leads to overestimate the applied vertical force. On the other
hand the drag values close to the threshold ﬂuctuate a lot.

(d) The drag is a non-monotonic function of speed for V > Vc. In fact, it can be seen in
inset of Fig. 1 that for V > Vc the wave resistance R ﬁrst decreases as the speed increases,
and then increases again for high enough speeds. This feature is not predicted by the current
theory, which anyway overestimates the actual drag. Moreover it is unlikely a viscosity eﬀect
since it is as much marked as the viscosity is low. It is possibly a general feature of such
a ﬂow, and in this case the theory should be revised to include viscosity and non-linear
aspects.

(Fig. 2) remarkably ﬁts the data points — note that
there is no adjustable parameters. A data point lies outside the curve, but this is probably
related to an imperfect magnetic wetting phenomenon. As the magnetic ﬁeld gets closer to
the peak instability threshold value H∗, the ﬂuid ”climbs” onto the wire, producing a much
higher viscous drag, a situation which gets away from our inviscid linear theoretical analysis.
This also explains the discrepancy in Fig. 3 between experimental and theoretical RH
C values.
We do not account for the force that the magnetic ﬁeld is exerting at the meniscus close
to the wire. Indeed, the very shape of the meniscus creates a non homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld which results in a force that sucks the magnetic ﬂuid up and changes the shape of the
meniscus. Only advanced numerical simulations would allow to compute the net force added
[10].

In conclusion, for the ﬁrst time a capillary-gravity wave resistance measurement is per-
formed on ﬂuids of various viscosities. A drag discontinuity is always observed for a critical
velocity Vc. Thanks to a magnetic ﬂuid the critical velocity range is experimentally ex-
tended. In all cases the measured critical velocities and the critical values of the resistance
are in good accordance with the developped models. If an inviscid theory is correct at the
threshold, there are some discrepancies for V > Vc such as a non-monotonic behavior of the
wave resistance. Viscosity and non linear aspects should be taken into account in further
works. Finally, in order to get rid of the viscous drag that is always present in our experi-
ments, another mode of disturbance is to be envisaged, such as a small magnet placed just
above the free surface of a ﬂowing magnetic ﬂuid.

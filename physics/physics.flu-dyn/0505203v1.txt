Kolmogorov’s theory for turbulence in 1941 is based on a hypothesis that small-scale statistics are
uniquely determined by the kinematic viscosity and the mean rate of energy dissipation. Landau
remarked that the local rate of energy dissipation should ﬂuctuate in space over scales of large eddies
and hence should aﬀect small-scale statistics. Experimentally, we conﬁrm the signiﬁcance of this
ﬂuctuation, which is comparable to the mean rate of energy dissipation at the typical scale of large
eddies. The signiﬁcance is independent of the Reynolds number and the conﬁguration for turbulence
production. With an increase of scale r above the scale of largest eddies, the ﬂuctuation comes to
−1/2 and tends Gaussian. We also conﬁrm that the ﬂuctuation aﬀects small-scale

statistics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

For locally isotropic turbulence, Kolmogorov1 based
his theory in 1941 on a hypothesis that small-scale statis-
tics are uniquely determined by the kinematic viscosity
ν and the mean rate of energy dissipation hεi. Landau2
remarked as follows. The local rate of energy dissipation
ε should ﬂuctuate in space over scales of large eddies.
The ﬂuctuation should not be universal but should be
diﬀerent for diﬀerent ﬂows. Since the ﬂuctuation should
aﬀect small-scale statistics, there should be no universal
law that describes the small-scale statistics.

Landau’s remark has been regarded as a prediction for
small-scale intermittency, i.e., enhancement of a small-
scale ﬂuctuation in a fraction of the volume. This is
because, when Kolmogorov3 revised his theory in 1962
to incorporate small-scale intermittency, he credited the
idea to Landau. However, the above remark is for a large-
scale ﬂuctuation. It might be that Landau communicated
to Kolmogorov more than documented in the literature
or Landau’s remark inspired Kolmogorov with an inde-
pendent idea of small-scale intermittency.4

Despite numerous studies of small-scale intermittency
in the energy dissipation,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 its large-scale ﬂuc-
tuation has not attracted much interest. This is es-
pecially the case at scales above the velocity correla-
tion lengths. The existing works are all theoretical.
Oboukhov11 considered that the ﬂuctuation is signiﬁcant.
Kraichnan12 considered that the ﬂuctuation is smoothed
out by spatial mixing, which could be caused by the ac-
tion of pressure ﬂuctuation.5 Frisch4,6 considered that the

ﬂuctuation is signiﬁcant in some speciﬁc conﬁgurations
for turbulence production. Thus, even for the signiﬁ-
cance of the ﬂuctuation, no consensus has been reached
on.

The importance of Landau’s remark is not only for
small-scale statistics. Any signiﬁcant phenomenon at
large scales is by itself important because the large scales
dominate the turbulence energy.

remark,

We experimentally assess Landau’s

i.e.,
whether the large-scale ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation
is signiﬁcant, whether the ﬂuctuation is universal, and
whether the ﬂuctuation aﬀects small-scale statistics, in
grid turbulence as the standard and in boundary-layer
turbulence as an application. Using a hot-wire anemome-
ter and Taylor’s frozen-eddy hypothesis, we obtain a one-
dimensional cut of the velocity ﬁeld. The local rate of
energy dissipation per unit mass is obtained along the
streamwise position x as

εu(x) = 15ν

is locally isotropic. The energy dissipation at the scale r
is obtained by coarse-graining the local rate:11

dissipation ε(r, x) around its average hε(r, x)i = hε(x)i is
studied as a function of scale r.

We study the features expected for largest scales in Sec.
II. Grid turbulence is studied in Sec. III. Boundary-layer

turbulence is studied in Sec. IV. The dependence on the
Reynolds number is studied in Sec V. We summarize our
conclusions and discuss the eﬀect on small-scale statistics
in Sec. VI. Taylor’s frozen-eddy hypothesis for large
scales is studied in Appendix.

II. LARGEST-SCALE FEATURES

Suppose that the local rate of energy dissipation ε(x) is
obtained on a one-dimensional cut of a turbulence ﬂow. If
the turbulence is homogeneous along the one-dimensional
cut, the correlation function φε(r) at the scale r is

φε(r) = h[ε(x + r) − hε(x)i][ε(x) − hε(x)i]i.

(3)

Here h·i denotes a spatial average over the position x.
The correlation length Lε is

2

There is another largest-scale statistical feature. The
total number of subregions r/r∗ in Eq. (7) is large. Then
the central limit theorem ensures that the energy dissipa-
tion ε(r, x) obeys a Gaussian distribution at least in the
vicinity of the average hε(r, x)i,9 provided that the ﬂuc-
tuation of energy dissipation σε(r) is suﬃciently smaller
than the average hε(r, x)i.

The scaling σε(r) ∝ r−1/2 and the tendency for Gaus-
sianity imply that rε(r, x) is additive at largest scales.
It is not additive at the smaller scales. The value of an
additive quantity for a region is the sum of its values
for the subregions that are mutually independent [Eq.
(7)]. Many examples exist in the statistical mechanics
and thermodynamics.13 There the scales of interest are
much greater than the scales where the correlation is sig-
niﬁcant.

III. GRID TURBULENCE

A. Experiment

We assume that the correlation is insigniﬁcant or absent
above a certain scale r∗, i.e., φε(r)/φε(0) ≃ 0 at r >
r∗ > Lε. This assumption is natural for the correlation
of any quantity in actual turbulence that only has a ﬁnite
extent.

The correlation function φε(r) allows us to obtain the
mean-square ﬂuctuation of the energy dissipation ε(r, x)
around its average hε(r, x)i:

σε(r)2 =

[ε(r, x) − hε(r, x)i]2

If the scale r is much greater than the scale r∗, we have

(6)

Thus the root-mean-square ﬂuctuation scales as σε(r) ∝
r−1/2.

We explain the scaling σε(r) ∝ r−1/2. If the scale r
is much greater than the scale r∗, the energy dissipation
ε(r, x) is written with the sum over subregions that have
a width r∗:

ε(r, x) =

ε(r∗, xn),

which again leads to the scaling σε(r) ∝ r−1/2. Thus this
scaling is not dynamical but statistical.

The experiment was done in a wind tunnel of the Me-
teorological Research Institute. We use the coordinates
x, y, z in the streamwise, spanwise, and ﬂoor-normal di-
rections. The corresponding turbulence velocities are u,
v, and w. The origin x = y = z = 0 m is taken on the
tunnel ﬂoor at the entrance to the test section. Its size
was δx = 18 m, δy = 3 m, and δz = 2 m.

We placed a grid across the entrance to the test section
at x = 0 m. The grid consisted of two layers of uniformly
spaced rods, the axes of which were perpendicular to each
other. The separation of the axes of adjacent rods was
0.20 m. The cross section of the rods was 0.04 × 0.04 m.
We set the mean wind to be U ≃ 10 m s−1.

The streamwise (u) and spanwise (v) velocities were
simultaneously measured using a hot-wire anemometer.
The anemometer was composed of a constant tempera-
ture system and a crossed-wire probe. The wires were
made of platinum-plated tungsten, 5 µm in diameter,
1.25 mm in sensitive length, 1 mm in separation, and
280 ◦C in temperature.

The measurement was done on the tunnel centerline
at x = 4 m, where the ﬂatness factors hu(x)4i/hu(x)2i2
and hv(x)4i/hv(x)2i2 were close to the Gaussian value of
3. Thus turbulence was well developed, so eddies with
various sizes and strengths ﬁlled the space randomly and
independently.14,15 If the measurement position had been
too close to or far from the grid, turbulence should have
been still developing or already decaying, and its ﬂat-
ness factors should have been diﬀerent from the Gaussian
value. The ratio hu2i1/2/hv2i1/2 was close to unity.

The signal was linearized, low-pass ﬁltered at 15 kHz
with 24 dB per octave, and then sampled digitally at 30
kHz with 16-bit resolution. The total length of the signal
was 3 × 108 points.

In addition, to study the energy injection at x = 4 m,
the streamwise velocity was simultaneously measured at

x = 3.75 and 4.25 m. We used single-wire probes with the
same wire parameters as the crossed-wire probe. The to-
tal length of the signal was 108 points. Other conditions
were the same as in the above measurement.

The ﬂow parameters at x = 4 m are summarized in Ta-
ble I. We used Taylor’s frozen-eddy hypothesis to convert
temporal variations into spatial variations in the stream-
wise direction (see Appendix). The velocity derivatives
were obtained from ﬁnite diﬀerences, e.g.,

du(x)
dx

=

u(x + δx) − u(x − δx)
2δx

.

(9)

Here δx is the sampling interval. Since the sampling
interval is small enough, the higher-order accuracy for
the velocity derivatives is not necessary.5

B. Results and discussion

The statistics of energy dissipation and relevant quan-
tities are studied over a wide range of scale r. Through-
out the r range, statistical signiﬁcance is satisfactory be-
cause our data are long.

Figure 1(a) shows the correlation functions for the local
rates of energy dissipation εu(x) and εv(x) and for the
velocities u(x) and v(x). The correlation lengths are also
shown. For the velocities, we deﬁned as

φu(r) = hu(x + r)u(x)i and Lu =

φv(r) = hv(x + r)v(x)i and Lv =

∞
0 φu(r)dr
R
φu(0)
∞
0 φv(r)dr
R
φv(0)

, (10a)

. (10b)

These correlation functions and correlation lengths of-
fer information about the scale structure of turbulence.
The velocity correlations φu(r) and φv(r) exist up to the

scale of largest energy-containing eddies. The correla-
tion length Lu corresponds to the mean scale of energy-
containing eddies. Since the local dissipation rates be-
long to small scales, their correlation functions φεu (r)
and φεv (r) decay fast (see Ref. 10 for another interpre-
tation). They are nevertheless signiﬁcant up to about
the correlation length Lu.8,10

Figure 1(b) shows the root-mean-square ﬂuctuations
of energy dissipation σεu (r) and σεv (r). They are en-
hanced at small scales owing to intermittency. They are
still comparable to the mean energy dissipation hε(x)i at
about the correlation length Lu. Thus, for the ﬁrst time,
we conﬁrm Landau’s remark2 that the energy dissipa-
tion should signiﬁcantly ﬂuctuate over scales of energy-
containing eddies. Consistent results are seen, albeit not
explicitly stated, in past experimental works.8,10 The sta-
tistical scaling σε(r) ∝ r−1/2 starts at about the scale
where the velocity correlations φu(r) and φv(r) vanish,
i.e., the scale of largest energy-containing eddies.

Figure 1(c) shows the skewness and ﬂatness factors for
the ﬂuctuation of the energy dissipation ε(r, x) around
its average hε(r, x)i. Their deﬁnitions are

skewness =

ﬂatness =

h[ε(r, x) − hε(r, x)i]3i
h[ε(r, x) − hε(r, x)i]2i3/2 ,
h[ε(r, x) − hε(r, x)i]4i
h[ε(r, x) − hε(r, x)i]2i2 .

(11a)

(11b)

They are enhanced at small scales owing to intermittency.
With an increase of scale above the correlation length Lu,
the skewness and ﬂatness factors approach the Gaussian
values of 0 and 3, respectively. The exact values are not
achieved even at largest scales,9 although the discrepancy
is too small to be discernible in our diagram. The cen-
tral limit theorem does not necessarily lead to an exactly
Gaussian distribution.

Except at smallest scales, the statistics for the sur-

their averages and root-mean-square ﬂuctuations around
the averages (for the energy injection, see also Appendix).
The mean energy transfer is close to the mean energy dis-
sipation hε(x)i in the inertial range, which extends up to
the mean scale of energy-containing eddies. There the
ﬂuctuations of energy injection and transfer are compa-
rable to each other and are several times greater than
the mean energy dissipation. In particular, the ﬂuctua-
tion of energy injection is maximal. These ﬂuctuations
come to have the statistical scalings r−1/2 and r−3/2,
respectively,18 at the scale where the ﬂuctuation of en-
ergy dissipation σε(r) comes to have the statistical scal-
ing r−1/2.

The energy dissipation occurs at the end of the en-
ergy cascade and hence depends on the scale-by-scale
energy transfer.12 Although the mean energy transfer is
downward, the local energy transfer is as often upward as
downward at each scale because its ﬂuctuation is strong
[Fig. 1(d)]. This ﬂuctuation of energy transfer causes the
large-scale ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation. Since the
former is stronger than the latter [Figs. 1(d) and 1(b)],
spatial mixing is at work,12 albeit incomplete.5 The ﬂuc-
tuation of energy transfer is associated with the ﬂuctua-
tion of energy injection. Since the local energy injection
is as often negative as positive [Fig. 1(d)], the individ-
ual energy-containing eddies as often gain as lose their
energies. There is accordingly the signiﬁcant ﬂuctuation
of energy dissipation over scales of energy-containing ed-
dies [Fig. 1(b)]. If the scale r exceeds the scale of largest
energy-containing eddies, the ﬂuctuations of energy in-
jection, transfer, and hence dissipation reﬂect the ran-
dom and independent distribution of energy-containing
eddies. They have the statistical scalings r−1/2, r−3/2,
and r−1/2 [Figs. 1(d) and 1(b)]. The ﬂuctuation of en-
ergy dissipation tends Gaussian [Fig. 1(c)].

IV. BOUNDARY-LAYER TURBULENCE

A. Experiment

rogate dissipation rates εu(x) and εv(x) are almost the
same.10 It is thereby expected that the true dissipation
rate would yield almost the same statistics.

The experiment was done in the same wind tunnel with
the same instruments as for the grid turbulence. We de-
scribe speciﬁc features. The ﬂow parameters are summa-
rized in Table I.

Figure 1(d) shows quantities in the scale-by-scale en-
ergy budget equation for decaying homogeneous isotropic

Over the entire ﬂoor of the test section of the wind
tunnel, we placed blocks as roughness for the boundary

e

layer. The block size was δx = 0.06 m, δy = 0.21 m, and
δz = 0.11 m. The spacing of adjacent blocks was δx =
δy = 0.5 m. We set the incoming wind to be 10 m s−1.

The measurement positions were at x = 12.5 m, where
the boundary layer was well developed. The 99% thick-
ness, i.e., the height at which the mean streamwise veloc-
ity U is 99% of its maximum value ˆU , was 0.77 m. The
0 (1 − U/ ˆU)dz was 0.20 m. Here
displacement thickness
ˆz is the height for the velocity ˆU .19 The log-law sublayer
R
was at z ≃ 0.15–0.35 m.

ˆz

The measurement was done at z = 0.05, 0.25, and
0.70 m. The height z = 0.05 m was in the roughness sub-
layer, where the ﬂow was aﬀected by the surface rough-
ness. There was a roughness block 0.5 m upstream. The
height z = 0.25 m was in the log-law sublayer, where vari-
ous eddies ﬁlled the space randomly and independently.15
The ﬂatness factor hv(x)4i/hv(x)2i2 was close to the
Gaussian value of 3. The height z = 0.70 m was in the
wake sublayer, where eddies did not ﬁll the space. They
intermittently passed the probe.

The ﬁltering frequency was 10 kHz and the sampling
frequency was 20 kHz at z = 0.05 m. The ﬁltering fre-
quency was 15 kHz and the sampling frequency was 30
kHz at z = 0.25 and 0.70 m.

Since turbulence was strong compared with the mean
streamwise velocity especially at z = 0.05 m, the u com-
ponent at smallest scales measured by the crossed-wire
probe was contaminated with the w component that is
perpendicular to the two wires of the probe. The v com-
ponent was free from such contamination.20 Hence we
prefer the rate εv(x) to the rate εu(x).

Turbulence was not isotropic at large scales, but it
should have been isotropic at small scales. This is be-
cause, with a decrease of scale r, the observed ratio be-
tween 2rhδv(r, x)2i and ∂r(r2hδu(r, x)2i) once becomes
the isotropic value of unity at about the correlation
length Lu.

B. Results and discussion

Figures 2–4 show the same statistics as Fig. 1, except
for the energy injection that is due to large-scale shear of
the boundary layer and is unable to be adapted into Eq.
(12).21 The energy transfer and dissipation are still of
physical signiﬁcance and satisfy Eq. (12) at small scales.
There are diﬀerences in the mean energy transfer. At
z = 0.25 m [Fig. 2(d)], the inertial range is wide. At
z = 0.05 m [Fig. 3(d)], the inertial range is wide, but
near its upper edge, the mean energy transfer is small.
This is due to the surface roughness. At z = 0.70 m
[Fig. 4(d)], the inertial range is narrow. There were
only few eddies. Their main bodies were at z ≪ 0.70 m.
Their small streamwise sizes at z = 0.70 m correspond
to the upper edge of the inertial range. The correlation
length Lu is relatively large because it reﬂects the spatial
distribution of those eddies.

Despite the diﬀerences in the mean energy transfer,
we ﬁnd common features, albeit not exactly universal.
They were also found in the grid turbulence. The lo-
cal rate of energy dissipation has a signiﬁcant correlation
up to about the correlation length Lu. There the ﬂuc-
tuation of energy dissipation σε(r) is comparable to the
mean energy dissipation hε(x)i. The ﬂuctuation of en-
ergy transfer is stronger. These ﬂuctuations come to have
the statistical scalings r−1/2 and r−3/2 at about the scale
where the velocity correlations vanish. The ﬂuctuation
of energy dissipation tends Gaussian.

Frisch4,6 considered that the large-scale ﬂuctuation of
energy dissipation is signiﬁcant if ﬂow parameters change
in space over a scale greater than the mean scale of
energy-containing eddies. An example is that turbulence
does not ﬁll the space.6 This is the case at z = 0.70 m.
However, not only at z = 0.70 m [Fig. 4(b)] but also at
z = 0.05 and 0.25 m [Figs. 3(b) and 2(b)], the large-scale
ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation is signiﬁcant.

V. DEPENDENCE ON THE REYNOLDS
NUMBER

The dependence of the ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation
σεv (r) on the microscale Reynolds number Reλ is studied
in Fig. 5. We use the data from our present experiments
and also those from our past experiments.22,23

Figure 5(a) shows the ﬂuctuation σεv (r) for grid tur-
bulence at Reλ = 105–329. The grid or the mean
wind velocity was not the same, but the ﬂatness factors
hu(x)4i/hu(x)2i2 and hv(x)4i/hv(x)2i2 were close to the
Gaussian value of 3. The ratio hu2i1/2/hv2i1/2 was close
to unity.22

Figure 5(b) shows the ﬂuctuation σεv (r) for boundary-
layer turbulence at Reλ = 295–1258. The data were ob-
tained in log-law sublayers at the same streamwise po-
sition x over the same roughness for diﬀerent incoming-
wind velocities. The ﬂatness factor hv(x)4i/hv(x)2i2 was
close to the Gaussian value of 3.23

Regardless of the Reynolds number, the ﬂuctuation

σεv (r) at the correlation length Lu is comparable to the
mean dissipation rate hεv(x)i. The boundary-layer tur-
bulence has a trend that the ﬂuctuation σεv (r) is smaller
at a higher Reynolds number. However, at Reλ = 9000 in
an atmospheric boundary layer,10 the ﬂuctuation σεu (r)
at the correlation length Lu is still comparable to the
mean dissipation rate hεu(x)i. The trend at Reλ ≫ 1000
is insigniﬁcant or absent. We could attribute the trend to
spatial mixing during the energy cascade.12,24 The cas-
cade depth and duration are signiﬁcantly greater at a
higher Reynolds number so far as it is not very high. For
the grid turbulence, the trend is not discernible because
the Reynolds number does not span a wide range.

VI. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION

Using grid turbulence and boundary-layer turbulence,
for the ﬁrst time, we experimentally conﬁrm Landau’s
remark2 that the energy dissipation should signiﬁcantly

ﬂuctuate over large scales. This ﬂuctuation is caused
by the ﬂuctuation of scale-by-scale energy transfer. Al-
though the ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation is smoothed
by spatial mixing,12 the smoothing is incomplete.5

The large-scale ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation is not
exactly universal as remarked by Landau.2 Nevertheless,
there are features that are independent of the Reynolds
number and the conﬁguration for turbulence production.
The ﬂuctuation σε(r) is comparable to the mean energy
dissipation hε(x)i at the correlation length of streamwise
velocity Lu. If the scale r exceeds the scale where the
velocity correlations vanish, the ﬂuctuation has the sta-
tistical scaling σε(r) ∝ r−1/2 and tends Gaussian.

The correlation length Lu corresponds to the mean
scale of energy-containing eddies. The velocity correla-
tions exist up to the scale of largest energy-containing
eddies. Hence, although the large-scale ﬂuctuation of en-

7

ergy dissipation is caused by that of energy transfer, they
are ultimately caused by individual energy-containing ed-
dies. Exceptionally, when turbulence does not ﬁll the
space, the large-scale ﬂuctuations are determined by the
distribution of energy-containing eddies.

Landau2 also remarked that the large-scale ﬂuctuation
of energy dissipation should aﬀect small-scale statistics
in the inertial and dissipation ranges. We ﬁnally discuss
this remark.

The large-scale ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation and
that of energy transfer do not aﬀect the small-scale statis-
tics considered by Kolmogorov,1 i.e., the mean energies
hδu(r, x)2i and hδv(r, x)2i. They are determined by the
averages of energy transfer and dissipation, which satisfy
the energy budget equation (12) regardless of their strong
ﬂuctuations [Fig. 1(d)–4(d)]. The Kolmogorov constant
hδu(r, x)2i/(rhε(x)i)2/3 for the inertial range is actually
universal among various ﬂows.25 When turbulence does
not ﬁll the space, the Kolmogorov constant is diﬀerent,
but the universal value is obtained if we consider the tur-
bulence regions alone.26 In addition, the energy spectrum
for small scales is universal if it is normalized with the
kinematic viscosity ν and the mean energy dissipation
hε(x)i.27

The large-scale ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation and
that of energy transfer aﬀect high-order small-scale
statistics, e.g., hδu(r, x)ni for n ≥ 4 and hε(r, x)ni for
n ≥ 2. They represent the ﬂuctuations of energy, en-
ergy transfer, and energy dissipation, which suﬀer from
the large-scale ﬂuctuations. For example, hδu(r, x)6i cor-
responds to the mean-square ﬂuctuation of the energy
transfer −5δu3/4r. The eﬀect of those large-scale ﬂuc-
tuations is not always signiﬁcant. We are still able to
demonstrate its presence using an inertial-range scaling

hε(r, x)ni ∝ rτn , and φε(r) ∝ r−µ at least in our
data (see also Figs. 1–5 and Ref. 8). The data for
Fig. 5 are used to compute the exponent γ over the r
range from 30η to 0.3Lu. Figure 6 shows the results
as a function of the Reynolds number Reλ. The grid
turbulence and the boundary-layer turbulence make
up diﬀerent sequences.28 Although the ﬂatness factor
hv(x)4i/hv(x)2i2 was commonly close to the Gaussian
value of 3, the conﬁguration for turbulence production
and hence the large-scale ﬂuctuations are diﬀerent. The
exponent sequence is accordingly diﬀerent. Consistent
results exist for the scaling φεu (r) ∝ r−µ and the depen-
dence of δu(r, x) and ε(r, x) on a large-scale quantity,
u(x).26,29,30 Thus,
since the large-scale ﬂuctuations
are not exactly universal, the high-order small-scale
statistics are not universal, although some conditional
statistics might be universal.11,30

Having conﬁrmed Landau’s remark, we underline that
turbulence is much more ﬂuctuating over large scales
than it has been usually assumed to be. The local energy

transfer is as often upward as downward. The individual
energy-containing eddies as often gain as lose their ener-
gies. These signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations lead to the large-scale
ﬂuctuation of energy dissipation and also aﬀect small-
scale statistics.

APPENDIX: TAYLOR’S HYPOTHESIS

Taylor’s frozen-eddy hypothesis leads to the conversion
of the streamwise position xL and time tL in the labora-
tory frame into the streamwise position xT and time tT
in a virtual reference frame (hereafter, the Taylor frame):

xT = −U tL and tT =

(A.1)

xL
U

.

Here U is the mean streamwise velocity. The second con-
version is not familiar but is necessary because eddies are

8

not exactly frozen (see below). Then a stationary signal
is converted into a streamwisely homogeneous signal. A
streamwisely homogeneous signal is converted into a sta-
tionary signal.

The Taylor frame is locally identical to a reference
frame moving with the mean stream. With an increase of
scale, Taylor’s hypothesis becomes a mere convention to
describe measured temporal variations in terms of spa-
tial variations. The signal in the Taylor frame is still
expected to be consistent with some realistic turbulence.
We thereby applied Taylor’s hypothesis to all the scales.
This is also in accordance with the situation considered
in Landau’s remark.2

Since our experiments were under a stationary con-
dition, the signals in the Taylor frame represent ﬂows
that are homogeneous in the streamwise direction. We
actually obtained the scaling σε(rT ) ∝ r−1/2
and the
tendency for Gaussianity expected for largest scales in
homogeneous turbulence.

T

Since our laboratory ﬂows were inhomogeneous in the
streamwise direction, the signals in the Taylor frame rep-
resent nonstationary ﬂows. We demonstrate this fact for
the grid turbulence. If turbulence is isotropic, homoge-
neous, and decaying, the energy budget equation is16,17

(A.2)
The ﬁrst term in the left-hand side stems from the non-
stationarity and represents the injection of energy bud-
get. We estimated this term from the data at xL = 3.75
and 4.25 m. The other terms were estimated from the
data at xL = 4 m. They are compared in Fig. 1(d). The
energy-budget equation (A.2) is satisﬁed throughout the
scales.

The above estimation appears to imply that the en-
ergy budget is supplied from the inhomogeneity of tur-
bulence along the streamwise direction in the laboratory
frame.16 However, once we have used Taylor’s hypothe-
sis, it is important to distinguish the laboratory frame
from the Taylor frame. Grid turbulence in the Taylor
frame is homogeneous in the streamwise direction and
nonstationary. This nonstationarity supplies the energy
budget.

18 Since the energy transfer −5δu3/4r has the factor r−1,
its statistical scaling is r−3/2 instead of r−1/2. This sta-
tistical scaling is also observed for the energy dissipation
15ν∂r(δu2)/2r.

19 These thicknesses are usually deﬁned using the incoming-
wind velocity. However, since our wind tunnel was inca-

9

pable of adjusting the mean pressure gradient to be zero,
the mean streamwise velocity at large heights exceeded the
incoming-wind velocity. We thereby used the maximum
mean streamwise velocity ˆU = 10.48 m s−1 at the height
ˆz = 0.90 m.

20 The two wires individually respond to all the u, v, and w
components. Since the measured u component corresponds
to the sum of the responses of the two wires, it is contam-
inated with the w component. Since the measured v com-
ponent corresponds to the diﬀerence of the responses, it is
free from the w component.

spurious at least partially. At a higher Reynolds number,
the Kolmogorov length was smaller below the probe size.23

Reλ was deﬁned using the spanwise velocity ﬂuctuation

present. The ratio hu2i1/2/hv2i1/2 was not far from unity
(1.2, Table I and Ref. 23), owing to the eﬀect of the surface
roughness.

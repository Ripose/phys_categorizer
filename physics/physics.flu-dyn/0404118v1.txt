Three-dimensional turbulence simulations are used to show that the turbu-
lent root mean square velocity is an upper bound of the speed of turbulent
diﬀusion. There is a close analogy to magnetic diﬀusion where the maximum
diﬀusion speed is the speed of light. Mathematically, this is caused by the
inclusion of the Faraday displacement current which ensures that causality
is obeyed. In turbulent diﬀusion, a term similar to the displacement current
emerges quite naturally when the minimal tau approximation is used. Simu-
lations conﬁrm the presence of such a term and give a quantitative measure
of its relative importance.

1 Introduction

Since the seminal paper of Prandtl (1925), turbulent diﬀusion has always been
an important application of turbulence theory. By analogy with the kinetic
theory of heat conduction, the turbulent exchange of ﬂuid elements leads to
an enhanced ﬂux, F , of a passive scalar concentration that is proportional to
the negative mean concentration gradient,

rms velocity, and ℓcor is the correlation length. Equation (1) leads to a closed
equation for the evolution of the mean concentration, C,

is a δ-function, it will be a gaussian at the next instant, but gaussians have
already inﬁnite support.

The above formalism usually emerges when one considers the microphysics
of the turbulent ﬂux in the form F = u R ˙c dt, where ˙c
∇C is the linear
approximation to the evolution equation for the ﬂuctuating component of the
concentration. Recently, Blackman & Field (2003) proposed that one should
instead consider the expression

∂F /∂t = ˙uc + u ˙c.

On the right hand side, the nonlinear terms in the two evolution equations for
u and c are not omitted; they lead to triple correlations which are assumed
F /τ , where τ is some relaxation time. Furthermore,
to be proportional to
there is a priori no reason to omit the time derivative on the left hand side
of equation (3). It is this term which leads to the emergence of an extra time
derivative (i.e. a ‘turbulent displacement ﬂux’) in the modiﬁed ‘non-Fickian’
diﬀusion law,

2 Validity of turbulent displacement ﬂux and value of τ

A particularly obvious way of demonstrating the presence of the second time
derivative is by considering a numerical experiment where C = 0 initially.
Equation (2) would predict that then C = 0 at all times. But, according to
the alternative formulation (5), this need not be true if initially ∂C/∂t
= 0.
In practice, this can be achieved by arranging the initial ﬂuctuations of c such
that they correlate with uz. Of course, such highly correlated arrangement
will soon disappear and hence there will be no turbulent ﬂux in the long time

Closer inspection of Fig. 1 reveals that when the wavenumber of the forcing
is suﬃciently small (i.e. the size of the turbulent eddies is comparable to the

new term is actually justiﬁed. Comparison with model calculations shows that
the non-dimensional measure of τ , St

validity of the quasilinear (ﬁrst order smoothing) approximation which would
only be valid for St

0.

Next, we consider an experiment to establish directly the value of St. We do
this by imposing a passive scalar gradient, which leads to a steady state, and
measuring the resulting turbulent passive scalar ﬂux. By comparing double

Finally, we should note that equation (3) in the passive scalar problem
was originally motivated by a corresponding expression for the electromotive
force in dynamo theory, where the ˙u terms leads to the crucial nonlinearity
of the α-eﬀect (Blackman & Field 2002).

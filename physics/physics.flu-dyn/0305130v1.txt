MOLECULAR DYNAMIC SIMULATION OF THE FLUID
CONCENTRATION FLUCTUATIONS IN TWO DIMENSIONAL
POROUS MEDIUM

M.N. OVCHINNIKOV

Abstract. The ﬁltration of ﬂuid in 2D porous medium is simulated by the
molecular dynamics technique. The high concentration of ﬂuid is created at
the initial point in time and the number of ﬂuid particles is investigated in
all porous. The concentration of particles pores and parameters of interac-
tion potentials is varied. In all cases the particles concentration decay is well
described by exponential functions. The decreasing of the interpore channels
leads to the increasing of the relaxation time and does not depend on the
system size. This phenomenon is observed in real ﬁltration processes.

In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the problem of description
the non-stationary ﬁltration in porous mezo and macro structures [1, 2]. In this
paper the evolution of density ﬂuctuations is considered by the molecular dynamics
simulation [3, 4]. The density of particles is related by ﬂuid or gas pressure in
modeling 2D porous media.

where r – the distances between particles, ε=1, σ=2−1/6 , parameter α varies
from 0 to 100, ρ varies from 0 to 1. The mass of all particles was equal to unity
(m=1).

2D porous system is constituted of the square lattice with porous cells. The
particles of solid state matrix embedded at sites in the lattice. In the borders of
the system under considerate are positioned the ﬁxed particles. The parameters α
and ρ are adopted so that matrix particles hesitate near the equilibrium position.
The matrix particles simulate the compressibility and elastic waves propagation in
porous medium. The average distance between them was equal to unity. Into a

situation when the ﬂuid particles move in pores and inter pores channels and have
a translation agility.

In our computer simulation the considerable ﬂuctuation of the particles number
produced in pore with index (1,1). Other pores have more less number of particles
in this time moment. Then the processes of redistribution of ﬂuid particles between
pores begin.

First the number of particles increase in pores (1,2), (2,1) and (2,2) then in (1,3),
(3,1), (3,2) and etc. At last the quasi equilibrium state is established in all pores.
Then we vary the size of systems and the concentration of particles in pore (1,1).
In Fig.1 is shown the time dependence of particles number in pore (1,1). The
ﬁrst curve is associated the condition when the concentration in pore (1,1) was more
than in others 3 times, the second curve 15 times and the third curve 81 times ones.
It is easily to seen that in all cases the kind of decay of the number of particles in
pore (1,1) is similar and may be described by exponential type function

− t

(cid:18)

τchar (cid:19)

where N (t) – the number of particles in current time moment, N0 – in initial
time moment ones, tchar - characteristic time of decay the elevated density of the
particles number in pore. The number of particles is normalized to the maximal
number.
In Fig.1 are shown the exponential approximations by solid lines also.
tchar in our experiments varies from 1 to 100.

In other pores are observed the increasing of particles density. Next the density
is reduced as the initial indignation penetrates deep into system. This process is
shown in Fig.2 for the pores (1,2), (2,2) and is compared with pore (1,1). We see
that the maximum of particles is observed in pore (1,2) at t=2.5 and in pore (2,2)
at t=5. Then the perturbations transfer into pores (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) etc.

It is an interesting to know what will be happen if we have narrowed the inter-
pore channels. We may do it varying the potential parameters and increasing the
repelling forces between matrix particles and ﬂuid particles ones. This procedure
will be imitate the narrowing of the inter channels distances. Then the perme-
ability of porous medium will reduce. Let us denote as ρ the characteristic radius
of the repelling force in potential (2). This quantity may be named as eﬀective
width of the interpore leaking ﬁeld. We expect that characteristic time tchar will
be increasing when the ρ rise. Such is indeed the case in our experiments. In Fig.3
is demonstrated the dependence of tchar from ρ/rmax for the pore (1,1). Here rmax
is the one half of the distances between the nearest neighbor matrix particles and
ρ/rmax may be named as relatively width of the ﬁeld interpore leaking. All the other
parameters in this kind of computer simulation are ﬁxed. We see with growing of
the ρ/rmax the ﬁltration resistance becomes essential and the tchar considerably
increase. This fact we may interpret as the decreasing the piezoconductivity when
the permeability decreases also. Experiments shown that the size of system does
not inﬂuence essentially on the value of tchar.

Conclusion

In our computer experiments the decay of the concentration of the particles in
separate pore is well described by exponents. This leads to the validity of relaxation
theories [1]. The time of relaxation does not depend on the size of the system. The
increasing of the repelling forces between the ﬂuid and matrix particles tends to

increase the time of relaxation of ﬂuid particles in pores, what corresponds to the
growing of ﬁltration resistance.

Abstract

A 3D metric conformally related to Arnold cat fast dynamo metric: dsA

2 = e−λzdp2 +

eλzdq2 + dz2 is shown to present a behaviour of non-dynamos where the magnetic ﬁeld ex-

ponentially decay in time. The Riemann-Christoﬀel connection and Riemann curvature ten-

sor for the Arnold and its conformal counterpart are computed. The curvature decay as

z-coordinates increases without bounds. Some of the Riemann curvature components such

as Rpzpz also undergoes dissipation while component Rqzqz increases without bounds. The

remaining curvature component Rpqpq is constant on the torus surface. The Riemann cur-

vature invariant K 2 = RijklRijkl is found to be 0.155 for the λ = 0.75. A simple solution

of Killing equations for Arnold metric yields a stretch Killing vector along one direction and

compressed along other direction in order that the modulus of the Killing vector is not con-

stant along the ﬂow. The ﬂow is shown to be untwisted. The stability of the two metrics

are found by examining the sign of their curvature tensor components. PACS numbers:

Introduction

Geometrical tools have been used with success [1] in Einstein general relativity (GR) have been

also used in other important areas of physics, such as plasma structures in tokamaks as been

clear in the Mikhailovskii [2] book to investigate the tearing and other sort of instabilities in

conﬁned plasmas [2], where the Riemann metric tensor plays a dynamical role interacting with

the magnetic ﬁeld through the magnetohydrodynamical equations (MHD). Recently Garcia

de Andrade [3] has also made use of Riemann metric to investigate magnetic ﬂux tubes in

superconducting plasmas. Thiﬀault and Boozer [4] following the same reasoning applied the

methods of Riemann geometry in the context of chaotic ﬂows and fast dynamos. In this paper

we use the other tools of Riemannian geometry, also user in GR, such as Killing symmetries ,

and Ricci collineations , to obtain Killing symmetries in the cat dynamo metric [5]. We also

use the Euler equations for incompressible ﬂows in Arnold metric [6]. Antidynamos or non-

dynamos are also important in the respect that it is important to recognize when a topology

or geometry of a magnetic ﬁeld does force the ﬁeld to decay exponentially for example. As

we know planar dynamos does not exist and Anti-dynamos theorems are important in this

respect. Thus in the present paper we also obtain antidynamos metrics which are conformally

related to the fast dynamo metric discovered by Arnold. Levi-Civita connections [7] are found

together Riemann curvature from the MAPLE X GR tensor package. The paper is organized as

follows: In section 2 the curvature and connection are found and the Euler equation is found.

In section 3 the Killing symmetries are considered.

In section 4 the conformal anti-dynamo

metric is presented with the new feature that the magnetic ﬁeld decays exponentially in time

along the longitudinal ﬂux tube ﬂow. Conclusions are presented in section 5.

from these connection components one obtains the Riemann tensor components

Note that since this component is negative from the Jacobi equation [7] that the ﬂow is

one may immediatly notice that at large values of z the curvature component (zpzp) is bounded

and vanishes,or undergoes a dissipative eﬀect, while component (zqzq) of the curvature in-

creases without bounds, component (pqpq) remains constant. As in GR or general Riemannian

manifolds, to investigate singular curvature behaviours we compute the so-called Kretschmann

scalar K 2 deﬁned in the abstract as

K 2 = RijklRijkl = [Rpzpzgqqgzz]2 + [Rpzpzgppgzz]2 + [Rqzqzgqqgzz]2 =

with the value of 0.75 for λ one obtains K 2 = 0.155. Which would give a almost ﬂat on

singular manifold.

In GR for example when this invariant is ∞ the metric is singular. This

would be a useful method to ﬁnd singularities in dynamos. Let us now compute the forced

Euler equation. The forced Euler equation in 3D manifold R3 is

< ~v, ∇ > ~v = ~F

(II.9)

where ~v is the speed of the ﬂow and ~F is the external force to the ﬂow. By expressing the

ﬂow velocity in 3D curvilinear coordinates basis ~ei (i, j = p, q, z) we obtain

(vi < ~ei, ~ek > ∂k)vl~el = F k~ek

(II.10)

3

Since the Kr¨onecker delta is given by < ~ei, ~ej >= δi

j we may write the Euler equation in the

form

Expanding the derivative on the LHS one obtains

(vk∂k)vl~el = F k~ek

< ~v, ∇ > ~v = [vkDkvl]~el = F l~el

where D is the covariant Riemannian derivative as deﬁned in reference 1. By making use of

the Gauss equation

The covariant derivative can be expressed by

Thus the Euler force equation becomes

Computation of the p-component of the force leads to

∂k~ep = Γp

Dkvl = ∂kvl − Γp

vz∂zvp = F p

In the next section we shall compute the Killing vector equation and yield a simple solution.

III Killing equations for fast dynamos

The Killing symmetries are deﬁned by the Killing equations

where ~χ represent the Killing vector and g represents the metric tensor. Explicitly this equation

Lχg = 0

(III.17)

reads

which explicitly reads

[∂lgik]χl + gil∂kχl + gkl∂iχl = 0

−λgppχz + 2gpp∂pχp = 0

e−λz∂qχp + eλz∂pχq = 0

(III.20)

(III.21)

(III.22)

Note that a very simple solution for this system can be obtained if we put χp = c1, χq = c2,
and χz = 0, where c1 and c2 are constants. Since this Killing vector has to satisfy the modulus

condition

|~χ|2 = gpp[χp]2 + gqq[χq]2 = [c1]2e−λz + [c2]2eλz

(III.23)

one immediatly notices that the modulus of the Killing vector cannot be constant along the

ﬂow, and is stretch along the q-direction and compressed along the p-direction.

In the next

section we shall analyze a new solution of MHD dynamo equation which is conformally related

to the Arnold fast dynamo metrics where stretch and compressible behaviors of the magnetic

ﬁeld appear as well.

IV Conformal anti-dynamo metric

Conformal metric techniques have been widely used as a powerful tool obtain new solutions

of the Einstein’s ﬁeld equations of GR from known solutions. By analogy, here we are using

this method to yield new solutions of MHD anti-dynamo solutions from the well-known fast

dynamo Arnold solution. We shall demonstrate that distinct physical features from the Arnold

solution maybe obtained. The conformal metric line element can be deﬁned as

ds2 = λ−2zdsA

2 = dx+

2 + λ−4zdx−

2 + λ−2zdz2

(IV.24)

where we have used here the Childress and Gilbert [5] notation for the Arnold metric in R3

which reads now

where the coordinates are deﬁned by

dsA

2 = λ2zdx+

2 + λ−2zdx−

2 + dz2

(IV.25)

~x = x+ ~e+ + x− ~e− + z~ez

(IV.26)

where a right handed orthogonal set of vectors in the metric is given by

~f+ = ~e+

~f− = λ2z~e−

~fz = λz~ez

A component of a vector in this basis, such as the magnetic vector ~B is

The vector analysis formulas in this frame are

The MHD dynamo equations are

~B = B+

~f+ + B− ~f− + Bz

∇ = [∂+, λ2z∂−, λz∂z]

∇. ~B = ∂+B+ + λ2z∂−B− + λz∂zBz = 0

∂t ~B + (~u.∇) ~B − ( ~B.∇)~u = ǫ∇2 ~B

where ǫ is the conductivity coeﬃcient. Since here we are working on the limit ǫ = 0 , which

is enough to understand the physical behavior of the fast dynamo, we do not need to worry

to expand the RHS of equation (IV.34), and it reduces to

(~u.∇) ~B = ∂z[B+~e+ + B−e2µz~e− + Bzeµz~ez]

(IV.35)

where we have used that ( ~B.∇)~u = Bzµeµz~ez and that µ = logλ. This is one of the main

diﬀerences between Arnold metric and ours since in his fast dynamo, this relation vanishes

since in Arnold metric ~u = ~ez where ~ez is part of a constant basis. Separating the equation

in terms of the coeﬃcients of ~e+, ~e− and ~ez respectively one obtains the following scalar

equations

∂zB+ + ∂tB+ = 0

∂tB− + ∂tB+2µB− = 0

∂tBz + ∂zB=0

Solutions of these equations allows us to write down an expression for the magnetic vector
ﬁeld ~B as

~B = [B0

z, λ−(t+z)B0

−, B0

z](t − z, y, x + y)

(IV.39)

From this expression we can infer that the ﬁeld is carried in the ﬂow, stretched in the ~fz
direction and compressed in the ~f− direction, while in Arnold’s cat fast dynamo is also com-
pressed along the ~f− direction but is stretched along ~f+ direction while here this direction

is not aﬀected. But the main point of this solution is the fact that the solution represents

an anti-dynamo since as one can see from expression (IV.39) the magnetic ﬁeld fastly decays

exponentially in time as eµ(t+z). Let us now compute the Riemann tensor components of the

new conformal metric to check for the stability of the non-dynamo ﬂow. To easily compute

this curvature components we shall make use of Elie Cartan [8] calculus of diﬀerential forms,

which allows us to express the conformal metric as

ds2 = dp2 + e4λzdq2 + eλzdz2

(IV.40)

or in terms of the frame basis form ωi is

ds2 = (ωp)2 + (ωq)2 + (ωz)2

(IV.41)

where we are back to Arnold’s notation for convenience. The basis form are write as

By applying the exterior diﬀerentiation in this basis form one obtains

bounds, the same happens with the other curvature components [8].

V Conclusions

In conclusion, we have used a well-known technique to ﬁnd solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld equa-

tions of gravity namely the conformal related spacetime metrics to ﬁnd a new anti-dynamo

solution in MHD nonplanar ﬂows. The stability of the ﬂow is also analysed by using other

tools from GR, namely that of Killing symmetries. Examination of the Riemann curvature

components enable one to analyse the stretch and compression of the dynamo ﬂow. The

Killing symmetries can be used in near future to classify the dynamo metrics in the same way

they were useful in classifying general relativistic solutions of Einstein’s gravitational equations

in four-dimensional spacetime [1].

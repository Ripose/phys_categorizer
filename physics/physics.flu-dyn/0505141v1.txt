Abstract

Numerical calculations of vortex ﬂows in Taylor-Couette systems with counter rotating cylinders

are presented. The full, time dependent Navier-Stokes equations are solved with a combination

of a ﬁnite diﬀerence and a Galerkin method. Annular gaps of radius ratio η = 0.5 and of several

heights are simulated. They are closed by nonrotating lids that produce localized Ekman vortices

in their vicinity and that prevent axial phase propagation of spiral vortices. Existence and spatio

temporal properties of rotating defects, of modulated Ekman vortices, and of the spiral vortex

structures in the bulk are elucidated in quantitative detail.

INTRODUCTION

2

The spontaneous appearance of spiral vortices in the annular gap between the concentric

rotating cylinders of the Taylor-Couette system [1] has been stimulating research activities

[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] ever since their prediction

[25] and ﬁrst observation [26]. Spiral vortex structures bifurcate like the competing toroidally

closed Taylor vortices out of the rotationally symmetric and axially homogeneous basic state

of circular Couette ﬂow (CCF), albeit at diﬀerent bifurcation thresholds [12, 24]. The Taylor

vortex ﬂow (TVF) is rotationally symmetric and stationary while the spiral vortex ﬂow (SPI)

breaks the rotational symmetry of the annular gap. It oscillates globally in time by rotating

azimuthally as a whole thereby propagating axially.

The spiral pattern is eﬀectively one dimensional like TVF. It is also stationary when seen

from a co-moving frame [6]: the spiral ﬁelds do not depend on time t, axial coordinate z,

and azimuthal angle ϕ separately but only via the combined phase variable φ = kz + Mϕ

−
ω(k, M)t. Here k and M are the axial and azimuthal wave numbers, respectively, and ω is

the frequency. In the ϕ

z plane of an ’unrolled’ cylindrical surface the lines of constant

−

phase φ are straight. An azimuthal wave number M > 0 implies a left handed spiral (L-SPI)

while M < 0 refer to right handed spirals (R-SPI) with our convention of taking k to be

positive. L-SPI and R-SPI being mirror images of each other under the operation z

z
→ −
are symmetry degenerate ﬂow states. Which of them is realized in a particular experimental

or numerical setup depends on initial conditions and parameter history.

With the lines of constant phase in the ϕ

z plane being oriented for both spiral types

−
obliquely to the azimuthal ’wind’ of the basic CCF both spirals are advectively rotated by the

latter like rigid objects. The direction of the common angular velocity ˙ϕSP I = ω(k, M)/M

is the one of the inner cylinder’s rotation rate [24] which we take to be positive. Due to the

advection enforced rigid-body rotation of the spiral vortices the phase of an L-SPI (M > 0) is

propagated axially upwards and that of an R-SPI (M < 0) downwards. Thus, the oscillatory

ﬂow structure of so called ribbons consisting of an equal amplitude nonlinear combination

of L-SPI and R-SPI rotates azimuthally but does not propagate axially [6]. On the other

hand, the rotationally symmetric (M = 0) structure of toroidally closed Taylor vortices is

stationary: being parallel to the azimuthal CCF the latter cannot advect these vortices.

Strictly speaking the axially homogeneous CCF and the TVF and SPI structures exist

February 21, 2014

with axially homogeneous amplitudes only in the theoretical idealizations of axially un-

bounded or axially periodic systems. Translational symmetry breaking conditions at the

top and bottom end of the annulus generate (mostly local) deviations in the basic state

ﬂow as well in the above mentioned vortex structures. For example, the experimentally

often used rigid non rotating lids that close the annular gap enforce for any driving the well

known stationary, rotationally symmetric Ekman vortices close to the lids [23, 27, 28, 29, 30].

Their spatially varying wave number and amplitude proﬁle distinguishes them from the TVF

structure with axially homogeneous proﬁles.

In a suﬃciently long system the Ekman vortex structures close to the lids smoothly

connect and transform to a bulk TVF structure both patterns being stationary with common

azimuthal wave number M = 0. So, then the question is: How do rotating and axially

propagating SPI vortices with M

= 0 arise in the bulk when the non propagating Ekman

vortex structures being ﬁxed at the lids prevent phase propagation there? This is basically

the problem that we elucidate here using numerical simulations of the full 3D Navier-Stokes

equations (NSE). Surprisingly, it does not seem to have been addressed in such a detail in

the literature.

[21, 32].

However, the inﬂuence of a ﬁnite system size on a traveling pattern like SPI vortex ﬂow

has been explored, albeit from a more general point of view [9, 15, 16, 31]. Also the dramatic

eﬀects of nonrotating rigid lids on the ﬂow in rather short Taylor Couette systems has been

investigated in detail for setups where the vortex structures show strong axial variations

Our paper is organized as follows:

In Sec. II we introduce the notation, the control

parameters, the basic equations, and the method used to simulate the Taylor Couette system.

Section III contains our results concerning the transient dynamics of spiral generation, the

steady state structure and dynamics in particular of the rotating defects, and the stability

of SPI ﬂow. The last section contains a conclusion.

II. SYSTEM AND THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION

We present numerical results for the vortex ﬂow in Taylor-Couette systems with counter-

rotating cylinders. The radius ratio r1/r2 of inner to outer cylinder is η = 0.5. Various
aspect ratios Γ = L/d of cylinder length L to gapwidth d = r2 −

r1 are considered in the

(2.3)

16. The ﬂuid in the annulus is taken to be isothermal and incompressible

with kinematic viscosity ν. To characterize the driving of the system, we use the Reynolds

R1 = r1Ω1d/ν ; R2 = r2Ω2d/ν .

(2.1)

They are just the reduced azimuthal velocities of the ﬂuid at the inner and outer cylinder,

respectively, where Ω1 and Ω2 are the respective angular velocities of the cylinders. The

inner one is always rotating counterclockwise so that Ω1 and R1 are positive.

Throughout this paper we measure lengths in units of the gapwidth d. The momentum

diﬀusion time d2/ν radially across the gap is taken as the time unit. Thus, velocities are

reduced by ν/d. With this scaling, the NSE take the form

Here p denotes the pressure reduced by ρν2/d2 and ρ is the mass density of the ﬂuid. Using

cylindrical coordinates, the velocity ﬁeld

solution. So, for example, a M =

M =

1) solutions subject to axially periodic boundary conditions. The range

120 to be explored here lies in a control parameter region where both, SPI

and TVF solutions exist with the former (latter) being stable (unstable) under periodic

boundary conditions. The bifurcation thresholds out of the CCF lie at R1 = 106.5 for SPI

and at R1 = 108.9 for TVF.

Strictly speaking these axially periodic solutions do not exist in systems of ﬁnite axial

length that are bounded by rigid lids: Ekman vortices [23, 27, 28, 29, 30] always appear

already subcritically near the lids with a spatially varying wave number and amplitude

proﬁle that distinguishes them from the homogeneous TVF structure. Also SPI ﬂow can

be realized with constant amplitude and wave number only in the bulk at suﬃciently large

distance from the lids.

A. Transient dynamics of spiral generation in the bulk

Here we want to show how spirals occur in the bulk of a Γ = 12 system as a representative

example of commonly used set-ups in experiments. We start from rest — to be precise from

the quiescent ﬂuid plus inﬁnitesimal white noise in all velocity ﬁelds. Then the rotation rates

of the cylinders are stepped up instantaneously to supercritical ﬁnal values of R1 and R2 for

which SPI ﬂow is stable and TVF is unstable under axially periodic boundary conditions,

cf. Fig. 1. Step up from a subcritical driving entails a similar transient.

1. Front propagation of unstable TVF into unstable CCF

Figs. 2 and 3 show the longterm evolution of the ﬂow for the case of R1 = 110 which

lies about 1% (2%) above the TVF (SPI) threshold. However, ﬁrst, the unstable CCF

ﬂow is growing radially in the bulk and simultaneously the Ekman vortices are growing

near the lids [33]. Both occurs on a fast time scale of about 1-2 radial diﬀusion times

February 21, 2014

6

which are not resolved in Figs. 2 and 3. Then TVF fronts are propagating axially into the

bulk from the Ekman vortex structures near the lids [33] — note that M = 0 TVF can

grow at supercritical driving independent of its stability behavior. So here we have a front

of an unstable structured state that propagates into an unstable unstructured one. The

velocity of the TVF fronts is rather large progressing at least 5 gapwidths per unit diﬀusion

time. So after about 5 diﬀusion times the fully developed unstable TVF is established with

homogeneous amplitude and wave number proﬁle in the bulk in equilibrium with the axially

varying Ekman vortex structures near the lids, cf. row A of Fig. 2.

2. Transformation of unstable TVF into stable SPI ﬂow

Starting with this conﬁguration, we illustrate in Fig. 2 the time evolution of the vortex

ﬂow. To that end we show in the top row snapshots of the radial velocity ﬁeld u in an

unrolled cylindrical ϕ-z-surface (that is azimuthally extended to 4π for better visualization)

by gray scale plots. The bottom row contains snapshots of the node positions of u at mid

gap. These snapshots cover a time interval of about 100 radial diﬀusion times. The snapshot

times are marked in Fig. 3 which exhibits the dynamics of the dominant characteristic mode

amplitudes for TVF (M = 0) and SPI (M =

1), respectively.

±
Snapshot (A) in Fig. 2 shows that by this time the rotational symmetric TVF state has

been established in the bulk. The Ekman vortices of higher ﬂow intensity are marked by

the brightest outﬂow line near each lid. By the time B the m =

1 modes that break

the rotational symmetry have grown suﬃciently to see the wavy deformation of the still

dominant M = 0 TVF in snapshot (B). Here the amplitudes of m = 1 and m =

1 modes

−

are still of equal size giving rise to an azimuthally rotating modulation of the TVF almost

harmonic behavior. Then the amplitudes of the m = 1 and m =

1 modes start to oscillate

in counterphase with growing oscillation amplitude while the m = 0 mode does not change

±

−

much, cf. Fig. 3. But shortly before time C the m = 1 L-SPI mode takes oﬀ: it continues

to increase while the m =

1 R-SPI mode and also the m = 0 mode decrease.

−

This mode behavior reﬂects the fact that starting in the bulk the TVF vortices become

more and more deformed. The nodes of u in the bottom row of Fig. 2 show how the vortices

approach each other (cf. arrows in C) and get pinched together at a defect that ”cuts”

them into two. They move apart (cf. arrows in D), get tilted in the ϕ-z plane of Fig. 2,

February 21, 2014

7

and reconnect diﬀerently to form locally a spiral vortex pair. This defect formation and

reconnection is repeated at two new locations further upwards and downwards towards the

lids. The defect propagation is stopped by the strong Ekman vortex structures. They are

only slightly indented by the rotating defect in the ﬁnal state.

So, in the ﬁnal state at time H the bulk is ﬁlled with an axially upwards propagating

L-SPI structure. Its phase is generated by a defect that is rotating in the lower part of the

system. The spiral phase is annihilated at another rotating defect in the upper part of the

system.

That here the m = 1 mode wins the mode competition leading ﬁnally to a L-SPI structure

in the bulk while the m =

1 mode gets suppressed is not due to an intrinsic selection

−

mechanism. It merely reﬂects the fact that in this particular transient the initial white noise

condition of the velocity ﬁeld had a slightly higher content of L-SPI modes. In other runs

with another noise realization the R-SPI could equally well win the competition given that

our random number generator for producing the white noise is unbiased.

B. Steady state structure and dynamics

By the time H in Fig. 2 transients have died out and the ﬂow has reached its ﬁnal state.

It consists of an L-SPI structure in the bulk with azimuthal wave number M = 1 (i.e., one

pair of spiral vortices), slightly modulated Ekman vortex structures that are localized next

to the two lids, and two rotating but axially not propagating defects. This ﬂow structure

is rotating as a whole like a rigid body with a global rotation rate ω into the same positive

ϕ-direction as the inner cylinder. However, the spiral rotation rate ω is somewhat smaller

than the one of the inner cylinder [24]. Driven by this rotation the L-SPI phase in the bulk

is propagating axially upwards.

We should like to stress that the ﬂow in Fig. 2H contains in the decomposition (2.5)

besides the dominant m = 1 SPI modes not only m = 0 modes that are related primarily

to the Ekman vortex structures but also a signiﬁcant m =

1 contribution, cf. Fig. 3.

−

The rotating defects and the rotating modulations of the Ekman vortices are the reason

for the presence of m =

1 modes in addition to m = 1 modes.

In fact, locally, in the

−

axially non propagating ﬂow regions of the rotating defects and of the rotating Ekman

vortex modulations they combine to axially standing oscillations.

1. Structure of the rotating defects

The Ekman vortices near the lids do not propagate but remain spatially localized while

the SPI vortices propagate. The connection between these topologically diﬀerent vortex

structures is provided by a pair of rotating defects: The one close to the lower Ekman

vortex structure generates the L-SPI phase and the one close to the upper one annihilates

the phase. With the two defects locating the beginning and end, respectively, of the spiral

vortex pair the former may be seen as pinning the latter.

The ﬂow structure in the vicinity of the two rotating defects is shown in Fig. 4 for R1 =

115. The gray scale plots show from top to bottom u, w, and the intensity I = √u2 + w2

over the ϕ

z-plane. The left (right) column documents the L-SPI generation (annihilation)

−

near the lower (upper) Ekman vortex structure. The phase generating defect in the three

ﬁelds of the left column that disrupts the bottom Ekman vortex structure has a slightly more

complex structure than the phase annihilating defect in the right column. One sees that the

Ekman vortices closest to the lids are modulated by the rotating defect but otherwise remain

intact. Figs. 2H and 4 show also that the upwards propagating spiral vortices compress the

Ekman vortex structure near the upper lid and dilate the one near the lower lid. Thus, the

upwards traveling SPI phase ”pushes” the Ekman vortices towards the top lid and ”pulls”

them away from the bottom lid.

For R1 = 110 (Fig. 2H), i.e., close to the SPI bifurcation threshold the axial extension

of the spiral region is not as large as, say, for R1 = 115 (Fig 4).

In fact, in the range

117 the bulk SPI region increases with increasing R1 by displacing the Ekman

vortex structures as the SPI amplitudes grow. Even stronger rotation speeds R1 > 117,

however, seem to prefer TVF: spirals are more and more displaced out of the boundary

110

R1 ≤

≤

region.

2. SPI versus TVF modes

In Fig. 5 we show axial proﬁles of the dominant contributions in the decomposition (2.4)

of the velocity ﬁelds from TVF and SPI modes. Full blue (dotted red) line show snapshots

of the real parts of m = 0 TVF (m = 1 SPI) Fourier modes of u and w at mid gap in systems

of diﬀerent length Γ.

February 21, 2014

9

One sees that for the ﬁxed R1 = 115 shown in Fig. 5 the extension of the m = 0 Ekman

vortex systems into the bulk and their structure remain unchanged when Γ is changed.

However, at Γ

10 the tails of the exponentially decreasing Ekman vortex ﬂow created by

the two lid start to visibly overlap in the bulk.

≃

On the other hand, the axial extension of the SPI vortex structure (dotted red lines) in

the bulk adjusts itself to the cylinder length. The amplitude of the m = 1 SPI mode is

constant in the bulk and it decays exponentially towards the lids. But it reaches well into

the Ekman vortex dominated region. This behavior reﬂects the rotating modulation of the

Ekman vortices that is caused by the rotating defect between SPI and Ekman vortices. To

sum all this up: decreasing the cylinder length shrinks the bulk range where spirals exist.

3. SPI wave number and frequency selection

Fig. 5 indicates that the SPI structure at mid height (that is deﬁned in Fig. 5 to lie

at z = 0 for presentation reasons) is the same, irrespective of the length of the system,

over a wide range of Γ. The observation of such a unique selection of the SPI structure is

corroborated by the fact that the SPI wave number k measured in the vicinity of the mid

height position is practically independent of Γ, cf. top plot of Fig. 6. The selected SPI

wave number varies between k = 3.47, λ = 2π/k = 1.81 (Γ = 16) and k = 3.57, λ = 1.76

(Γ = 10).

Here it is worth mentioning that the corresponding SPI wavelength of λ

1.76 has been

≃

observed in experiments [18] done in a system of length Γ = 12. Furthermore, also the

numerically determined SPI ﬂow structure agrees almost perfectly with the one obtained by

the afore mentioned laser-Doppler velocimetry measurements, cf. Fig. 8 of Ref. [24]. The

selected frequency is ω

30.3 so that the SPI phase propagates axially with phase velocity

ω/k

8.6.

≃

≃

Fig. 6 shows results of a numerical simulation in which the length Γ was ramped down

from Γ = 16 to Γ = 5 in steps of ∆Γ = 0.05 by moving the top lid downwards. The

time intervals between successive steps were about 2 radial diﬀusion times so that the SPI

phase had always enough time to propagate from one end to the other. In the bottom plot

of Fig. 6 we show for each Γ the axial distribution of the nodes of u by dots. The nodes

were monitored at discrete times during this time interval at a ﬁxed ϕ. So, for example,

February 21, 2014

10

the broadened lines near the top and bottom lids denote the narrow axial excursions of the

locations of the Ekman vortices being modulated by the rotating defects. On the other

hand, the homogeneously distributed dots in the center reﬂect the propagating SPI phase.

C. Stability of SPI ﬂow

1. Decreasing Γ

When in the above described ramping ’experiment’ the length has fallen below Γ

8.3

≃

the system has become too small to allow for a propagating SPI phase in the center. Instead

stationary M=0 Ekman and TVF is realized throughout the system with 10 nodes in the

bulk, cf., right part of Fig. 6. Reducing Γ further the Taylor vortices become compressed,

cf., the wave number plot. Then the number of nodes of u reduces to 8 and ﬁnally to 6 as a

vortex pair is annihilated in the center and then yet another one. The compression prior to

the vortex pair annihilation and the relaxation to the old k-value after the annihilation can

be seen in the top plot of Fig. 6.

2.

Increasing Γ

We also did a reverse ramp simulation in which the length was increased from Γ = 5

to Γ = 16 starting from TVF with very small admixtures of m

= 0 modes as they are

still present shortly after a start from rest. The time intervals between upwards steps of

∆Γ = 0.05 was 2 radial diﬀusion times. This time interval, however, is not long enough to

allow for the full development of the spiral generating defects that are described in detail in

Sec. III B 1. Here the SPI ﬂow permanently re-appeared in the center only at Γ

10 whereas

≃

it had disappeared in the downwards ramp at Γ

8.3. The reasons for this hysteresis are

≃

on the one hand the upwards ramp being too fast but also an inherent bistability between

TVF and SPI ﬂow in this small system that is suggested by the following simulation:

3. Diﬀerent initial conditions

Here we started with a perfect, axially periodic L-SPI structure of wavelength λ = 1.6 at

R1 = 115, R2 =

100. Then we imposed instantaneously the rigid-lid boundary conditions

−

6
February 21, 2014

11

at z = 0 and z = Γ = 5.85. Soon a defected vortex structure appeared ( cf., Fig. 7) that

rotates as a whole like a rigid body. But the phase propagates axially upwards only in
um,n|
(2.5) of the radial velocity ﬁeld at mid gap towards this ﬁnal state are shown in Fig. 8. So,

a very small central region. The time evolution of the six largest mode amplitudes

|

this vortex solution is dominated by the m = 0 modes from the Ekman vortices. Then it

contains m = 1 modes with L-SPI character but there is also a signiﬁcant admixture of

m =

1 modes with R-SPI character.

−

4. Remarks

Obviously the control parameter range in the R2 −

R1-plane of Fig. 1 in which SPI are

stable in ﬁnite length systems depends on Γ. Reducing Γ will shrink the range of SPI ﬂow

eventually to zero because of the ever present Ekman vortices in ﬁnite length systems. In

addition, the Ekman vortices prevent also to reach the full stability domain of SPI under

axially periodic conditions when Γ is increased. For example, at R2 =

100 we could not

−

obtain stable SPI ﬂow for R1

123, i.e., in a domain where SPI solutions coexist bistably

with TVF solutions when axially periodic boundary conditions prevent Ekman vortices.

>
∼

We checked that our numerically obtained stability boundaries largely agree with experi-

mental ones [18]. But in the above described downwards-ramp-simulation we do not see SPI

anymore for Γ < 8.3 and in particular not at Γ = 5.85 (where they are reported, e.g., for our

R1 = 115, R2 =

100 in Fig. 3 of Ref. [23]) but rather TVF, i.e, a pure M = 0 stationary

−

state. However, when starting from diﬀerent initial conditions with diﬀerent histories we do

see there SPI-like phase propagation with several modes being present. Thus, there seems to

be multi- or at least bistability of pure M = 0 vortex ﬂow states coexisting with mixed-mode

ones.

We ﬁnally mention that the way how SPI ﬂow in the center is destroyed or generated

depends on the way the relevant parameters, say, R1 and Γ are varied.

In Fig. 6 Γ was

decreased quasi-statically causing a reduction of the SPI extension that was almost quasi-

static except for the last instance. What happened there can be better observed in a diﬀerent

simulation: starting at R1 = 115 with stable L-SPI in a long system the inner Reynolds

number is stepped up instantaneously into the instability range of SPI ﬂow, R1

120.

Then a fast TVF front propagates upwards. It originates from the Ekman vortex structure

>
∼

February 21, 2014

12

and it pushes the SPI phase generating defect upwards. The Ekman vortex structure at

the upper lid, however, is unable to trigger a downwards propagating TVF front against the

upwards traveling L-SPI phase. In fact the phase annihilating defect below the upper Ekman

vortex structure seems to be more robust. Finally there could arise local wavy vortex ﬂow

at large enough R1 or TVF. But we have also observed for smaller R1 counter propagating

spirals which originate from a defect in the center.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have numerically investigated how SPI ﬂow is realized in ﬁnite length Taylor Couette

systems in which stationary top and bottom lids close the annulus, i.e., in the presence

of spatially localized Ekman vortices. Results are presented for several system lengths

5

Γ

≤

≤

16. In the parameter range investigated here SPI solutions are stable under axially

periodic boundary conditions. But TVF solutions would be unstable there under these

idealized conditions without Ekman vortices. The presence of the latter in real systems

tends to stabilize TVF and to destabilize SPI ﬂow.

For example, in a start-from-rest simulation with small initial noise one can observe the

following scenario: First, on a short time scale of 1-2 radial diﬀusion times, the unstable

CCF is growing radially in the bulk and simultaneously Ekman vortices are growing near

the lids. Then fast TVF fronts propagate axially into the bulk from the Ekman vortex

structures. Thereby unstable CCF is replaced by TVF within a few diﬀusion times. For

those parameters for which this TVF is unstable in ﬁnite systems on can then observe a slow

transformation of TVF to SPI ﬂow. Therein a pair of bulk TVF vortices becomes more and

more deformed and gets pinched together at a defect that ’cuts’ them into two. They move

apart, get reoriented, and reconnect diﬀerently to form locally a spiral vortex pair. This

defect formation and reconnection is repeated at two new locations further upwards and

downwards towards the lids. Finally the axial defect propagation is stopped by the strong

Ekman vortex structures.

So, in the ﬁnal state the bulk is ﬁlled with, say, an axially upwards propagating L-SPI

structure. Its phase is generated by a defect that is rotating in the lower part of the system.

The spiral phase is annihilated at another rotating defect in the upper part of the system.

The Ekman vortex structures are only slightly indented and modulated by the respective

February 21, 2014

13

rotating defect. The whole ﬂow structure is rotating as a whole like a rigid body with a

global rotation rate into the same positive ϕ-direction as the inner cylinder.

The SPI structure in the bulk is uniquely selected with an axial wave number that does

not depend on Γ. When changing quasi-statically the system length at ﬁxed R1, R2 the

axial extension over which SPI ﬂow is realized in the bulk changes accordingly. The Ekman

vortex structures, on the other hand, remain basically unaﬀected. Below a critical Γ the

two Ekman vortex structures have come too close to allow for SPI ﬂow any more.

FIG. 2: Snapshots of the time evolution towards L-SPI ﬂow in the bulk. The snapshot times

A-H are indicated in Fig. 3. Top row shows the radial velocity ﬁeld u in an unrolled cylindrical

ϕ-z-surface at mid gap by gray scale plots with white (black) denoting radial out (in) ﬂow. Bottom

row shows the node positions of u. For better visibility the plots are periodically extended to an

azimuthal interval of 4π. The initial condition is the ﬂuid at rest plus inﬁnitesimal white noise in

all velocity ﬁelds. Final Reynolds numbers are R1 = 110, R2 =

100. Aspect ratio Γ=12.

FIG. 4: Flow structure in the vicinity of the rotating defects. The left (right) column documents

the L-SPI generation (annihilation) near the lower (upper) Ekman vortex structure. Shown are

the ﬁelds u, w, and I = √u2 + w2 at mid gap over the ϕ

z-plane. Note that there is only one

defect at top and bottom: for better visibility the plots are periodically extended to an azimuthal

interval of 4π. Thick (red) isolines in the u, w plots show the node positions of these ﬁelds.

Parameters are R1 = 115, R2 =

100, Γ=12.

FIG. 6: Spatio temporal properties of the vortex ﬂow as a function of system length. Γ was ramped

down in steps of 0.05 by moving the top lid downwards with about 2 radial diﬀusion times between

successive steps. For each Γ the nodes of u were monitored during this time interval at discrete

times at a ﬁxed ϕ. Bottom plot shows the axial distribution of these nodes by dots, cf. text for

further information and discussion. Top plot shows the wave number in the vicinity of mid height

location z = Γ/2. The vertical dashed line marks the transition from SPI in the center part to

TVF in this ramp ’experiment’. Parameters are R1 = 115, R2 =

Sensitive dependence on initial conditions in
transition to turbulence in pipe ﬂow

(Received ??)

The experiments by Darbyshire and Mullin (J. Fluid Mech. 289, 83 (1995)) on the
transition to turbulence in pipe ﬂow show that there is no sharp border between initial
conditions that trigger turbulence and those that do not. We here relate this behaviour
to the possibility that the transition to turbulence is connected with the formation of
a chaotic saddle in the phase space of the system. We quantify a sensitive dependence
on initial conditions and ﬁnd in a statistical analysis that in the transition region the
distribution of turbulent lifetimes follows an exponential law. The characteristic mean
lifetime of the distribution increases rapidly with Reynolds number and becomes inacces-
sibly large for Reynolds numbers exceeding about 2200. Suitable experiments to further
probe this concept are proposed.

1. Introduction

The transition to turbulence in pipe ﬂow has been the subject of many investigations
since the ﬁrst documentation of its phenomenology in (Reynolds 1883). Reynolds already
noticed that there was no sharp transition, that the transition could be delayed to very
high Reynolds number when perturbations to the laminar proﬁle where carefully avoided
and that sometimes turbulence appeared without clear evidence for a perturbation that
may have triggered it. His ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed and expanded on in many
subsequent experiments, e.g. (Wygnanski & Champagne 1973; Wygnanski et al. 1975;
Rubin et al. 1980; Eggels et al. 1994; Ma et al. 1999; Darbyshire & Mullin 1995). On the
theoretical side, no linear instability could be found (see Schmid & Henningson (1994);
Meseguer & Trefethen (2003) and references therein) but the analysis of the consequences
of the non-normality of the linearized problem have led to the identiﬁcation of eﬃcient
ampliﬁcation mechanisms that can explain the sensitivity to small perturbations of the
laminar proﬁle (Boberg & Brosa 1988; Schmid & Henningson 1994; Trefethen et al. 2000,
1993; Grossmann 2000). On the other hand the simulations in (Brosa 1989) and the ex-
periments in (Darbyshire & Mullin 1995) suggest that even if the perturbations are large
enough to trigger turbulence, the ﬂow can re-laminarize without any previous indication.
Similar behaviour has been found in plane Couette ﬂow (Schmiegel & Eckhardt 1997,
2000; Bottin et al. 1998; Faisst & Eckhardt 2000; Eckhardt et al. 2002).

A decay of the turbulent ﬂow must follow from the dynamics of the fully developed 3-d
turbulent state and cannot be explained by linearization around the laminar ﬂow. The
dynamical system concept compatible with such a behaviour is that of a chaotic saddle,
a transient object with chaotic dynamics (T´el 1991; Ott 1993). The simplest example of
a chaotic saddle arises for a particle in a box with a tiny hole: the dynamics inside the
box can be chaotic, as measured by positive Lyapunov exponents, but it is transient and
ends when the particle leaves the hole. The escape through the hole is a global event, and

2

its rate is not related to the Lyapunov exponent. The analogy then is that the turbulent
state is motion in the box, and escape from the box is related to relaminarization. The
characteristic signatures of a chaotic saddle are: (a) a sensitive dependence of life times
on initial conditions, (b) an exponential distribution of lifetimes for initial conditions on
the chaotic saddle, (c) a positive short time Lyapunov exponent in the chaotic phase,
and (d) an independence of the variations of Lyapunov exponents and the escape rates
with parameters. We will show here that the transition to turbulence in pipe ﬂow shows
all these characteristics and is thus compatible with the formation of a chaotic saddle.

Our analysis is based on numerical simulations of the time evolution of perturbations in
circular pipe ﬂow with periodic boundary conditions in the downstream direction. The ax-
ial period lenght will be too short to simulate localized turbulent structures, such as puﬀs
and slugs (Wygnanski & Champagne 1973; Wygnanski et al. 1975), but long enough to
capture the local turbulent structures. Following the simulations of (Eggels et al. 1994)
we take a length 10R, with R the pipe radius. The turbulence will then typically ﬁll the
entire volume and we do not have to consider the advection of the turbulent state by the
mean proﬁle: lifetimes can be deﬁned locally. The Reynolds number Re is based on the
mean streamwise ﬂow velocity U and the pipe diameter 2R,

Re = 2RU/ν .

(1.1)

and the units of time are 2R/U . As in the experiments (Darbyshire & Mullin 1995) we
keep the volume ﬂux constant in time: this simpliﬁes the analysis and prevents decay
due to a reduction of ﬂux that could occur in pressure driven situations when the ﬂow
becomes turbulent.

2. Numerical considerations

We use cylindrical coordinates and employ a pseudo-spectral method with Fourier
modes in the periodic azimuthal and downstream direction and Legendre collocation ra-
dially (Canuto et al. 1988). Various linear constraints on the velocity ﬁeld are treated to-
gether by the method of Lagrange multipliers: the rigid boundary condition, the solenoidal-
ity, the regularity conditions at the coordinate singularity, and the analyticity in the
neighbourhood of the coordinate singularity at the center line (Priymak & Miyazaki
1998). We veriﬁed our numerical scheme in various ways. For the linearized dynamics we
reproduced the literature data on the eigenvalue spectrum of the linearized Navier-Stokes
operator with full spectral precision (Schmid & Henningson 1994). For the nonnormal lin-
ear dynamics and nonlinear 2D dynamics we reproduced Zikanov’s results (Zikanov 1996).
At Re = 5000 a long, fully nonlinear 3D turbulent trajectory was analysed and its sta-
tistical properties agreed with previous numerical and experimental results (Eggels et al.
1994; Quadrio & Sibilla 2000).

The results presented here are obtained with azimuthal and axial resolution of |n/17|+
|m/15| < 1, where n and m are the azimuthal and streamwise wavenumbers, respectively,
and 50 Legendre polynomials radially. This resolution is not the maximal that could be
integrated for a single run but reﬂects a compromise between the mutually exclusive
requirements of maximal resolution, maximal integration time for a single run and a
large number of sample runs for the statistical evaluations. It is justiﬁed by comparisons
with lower and higher resolutions which show no signiﬁcant diﬀerences for the range
of Reynolds numbers Re < 2300 to which we restrict our computations. The maximal
integration time after which we truncate a turbulent trajectory is 2000, sometimes 3000
natural time units. This by far exceeds the values accessible in the longest currently
available experimental set up (Ma et al. 1999; Hof et al. 2003). For the statistical analysis

Figure 1. Traces of normalized pressure gradient (top) and energy content E3D (Eq. 2.2)
(bottom) for three slightly diﬀerent initial conditions at Re = 2100. The initial energies are
chosen high above the turbulent mean and the trajectories require about 200 time units to relax
to the neighborhood of the turbulent mean. Pressure drop and energy content show correlated
ﬂuctuations. Note that within statistical ﬂuctuations the averages of the turbulent dynamics
are the same. This includes the green trajectory which happens to decay near t = 2000. The
bottom frame shows the kinetic energy of the streamwise modulated part of the velocity ﬁeld,
E3d, normalized by its turbulent mean as a measure of the velocity ﬂuctuations

and the calculations of Lyapunov exponents more than 1000 runs were needed, adding
up to several years of CPU time on a single 2.2 GHz Pentium4/Xeon processor.

The initial conditions for each run are the parabolic proﬁle uHP to which a three-
dimensional perturbation up is added. The speciﬁc form of up should not matter, as long
as it triggers a transition to turbulence, since the dynamics of the turbulent state has
positive Lyapunov exponents and leads to a quick elimination of any details and memory
of the initial conditions. Furthermore, experiments with diﬀerent kinds of wall-normal or
azimuthal jets or other perturbations lead to very similar results (Darbyshire & Mullin
1995), so that we can safely assume that there is only one turbulent state to which all
initial conditions are attracted. Therefore, we take as initial condition an uncorrelated
random superposition of all available spectral modes. Changes in the initial conditions
are then limited to variations in the amplitude of the perturbation, not in the form, i.e.,
we scan the behaviour along a one-dimensional subset in the space of all velocity ﬁelds,
u(0) = uHP + aup.

We deﬁne the amplitude A of an initial disturbance as its kinetic energy in units of

This deﬁnition has a trivial Reynolds number dependence that is important for the

to maintain a constant mean ﬂux and the energy variable E3d, the kinetic energy in the

Figure 2. Turbulent lifetime vs. perturbation amplitude for diﬀerent Reynolds numbers. For all
Reynolds numbers a smooth region with short-lived states can be observed for small amplitudes.
For larger Reynolds numbers this is followed by a ragged region of highly ﬂuctuating lifetimes.
The threshold amplitude that divides the two regions decreases with Reynolds number. The

(2.2)

The signiﬁcance of E3d is that if it becomes too small, then the ﬂow is too close to
an axially translation invariant ﬂow ﬁeld and will eventually decay (Zikanov 1996). We
therefore truncate integration if it drops below a threshold of 10−4.

Typical trajectories are shown in Fig. 1. Within about 150 time units they relax towards
the turbulent state. The trace shown in green belongs to an initial condition for which
the lifetime of the turbulent state is about 2000: there is no indication of the decay until
the energy E3d drops so low that turbulence cannot recover.

Scanning the lifetimes of turbulent states as a function of initial amplitude for diﬀerent
Reynolds number we obtain the results shown in Fig. 2. For suﬃciently small amplitudes
all states decay and the lifetimes are short. Beginning with a Reynolds number of 1800
sharp peaks with very long lifetimes appear. Beyond Re = 2000 several initial conditions
reach lifetimes up to the integration cut-oﬀ of tmax = 2000. Moreover, the variations in
lifetimes between neighboring sampling points in amplitude increase.

The transition between the short lifetimes for the initial conditions that decay quickly
towards the laminar state and the longer ones for trajectories that show some turbulent
behaviour is a very rapid one. Successive magniﬁcations of a small region in amplitude
for Re = 2000 are shown in Fig. 3. The increase is not monotonic, with modulations and
structures superimposed.

Despite this rapid increase and the jumps in lifetimes between sampling points it should
be noted that the lifetime is a smooth function of initial conditions, at least in intervals of

the parameters. However, the variations are again extremely rapid. Fig. 4 compares the
energy traces for four initial conditions in two ranges of amplitude. Fig. 4a for the smaller
mean amplitude shows that in an interval of width about 3% of the mean amplitude the
lifetimes increase by about 40%. At a slightly higher amplitude Fig. 4b shows that in an
interval of relative width 3 · 10−4 the lifetimes increase by a factor of almost 4!

The strong ﬂuctuations in lifetimes are not limited to variations with amplitude alone,
they also occur when changing the Reynolds number for ﬁxed amplitude, as shown in
Fig. 5. Such fractal behaviour in the variations of lifetimes under parameter variation have
previously been observed in plane Couette ﬂow (Schmiegel & Eckhardt 1997), Taylor-
Couette ﬂow for large radii (Faisst & Eckhardt 2000; Eckhardt et al. 2002), and in models
with a suﬃcient number of degrees of freedom (Eckhardt & Mersmann 1999).

The sensitive dependence on variations of initial conditions can also be quantiﬁed in
terms of short time Lyapunov exponents (Eckhardt & Yao 1993). For a trajectory u(t)
and deviations δu(t) the largest Lyapunov exponent is deﬁned as

ensembles of Lyapunov exponents with ﬁnite T , extracted from the integration of several
diﬀerent small deviations from the reference trajectory. The separation was measured
after time intervals of T = 200 units, and the deviation was then reduced again to
||δu|| = 10−9. An initial time interval of 200 units was omitted because of the transient
relaxation of the initial conditions onto the turbulent state. Similarly, the last 200 time
units were omitted to avoid the decay to the laminar state.

The short-time Lyapunov exponents are strongly correlated with the large energy ﬂuc-
tuations, see Fig. 6a. When new large scale structures are generated the energy grows
strongly and the Lyapunov exponent increases. Towards the end of a nonlinear regenera-
tion cycle the energy goes down and the Lyapunov exponent decreases as well. Therefore,
the ﬂuctuations in the exponent are large and averages over at least 104 time units are
needed for the determination of reliable numbers. Obviously, this is very diﬃcult to
achieve for lower Reynolds numbers below Re = 2000, where only very few trajectories
stay turbulent for suﬃciently long times.

The largest Lyapunov is shown in Fig. 6b. Its typical value is about 6.5 × 10−2 at
Reynolds numbers around 2000. Thus, over a time interval of 200 units a perturbation
grows 106-fold! For predictability this Lyapunov implies that an uncertainty doubles
after a time of (ln 2)/λ ≈ 10 units. Note that 200 units is about the separation between
two oscillations in the mean energy in Figs. 1 and 6a and is typical duration of the

regeneration cycle proposed in (Hamilton et al. 1995; Waleﬀe 1995, 1997). Thus, the
Lyapunov exponent is small in absolute value, but fairly large on the intrinsic time scales
of the turbulent dynamics.

The extreme sensitivity of turbulent lifetimes to variations in initial conditions will
make it next to impossible to prepare experimental perturbations suﬃciently accurately
to reproduce a run. A statistical analysis of, e.g., the distribution of lifetimes obtained by
collecting data for several nearby initial conditions, should be more reliable. We, therefore,
study P (t), the probability that a ﬂow started with some initial condition will still be
turbulent after a time t. A related kind of statistics was proposed in (Darbyshire & Mullin
1995): they analyzed the fraction of initial conditions that remained turbulent over the
time T it took for the perturbation to transit the distance between perturbation and
detection. (Recall that we do not need to take this advection into account since our
period length is so short that the turbulence ﬁlls the entire volume.) In terms of our
P (t), this probability is p = P (T ). However, because of the unknown relation between
the initial relaxation times in our simulations and the experiment we cannot compare
values.

For the lifetime statistics we used more than 50 initial conditions each for eight
Reynolds numbers in the range from 1600 to 2200. The initial amplitudes were fairly
high, ≈ 1, in order to assure transition to turbulence at least for a short time interval.
The results for diﬀerent Reynolds numbers are shown in Fig. 7.

The data support an exponential decay P (t) ∼ exp(−ǫt) for large times, with ǫ the
rate of escape from the turbulent state. An exponential distribution of turbulent lifetimes
is a characteristic signature for escape from a chaotic saddle (Kadanoﬀ & Tang 1984; T´el
1991; Ott 1993). They have previously been seen in experiments (Bottin & Chat´e 1998;
Bottin et al. 1998) and numerical studies on plane Couette ﬂow (Schmiegel 1999), as well
as in Taylor-Couette ﬂow (Eckhardt et al. 2002). They seem to be a generic feature of
the transition in shear ﬂows that are not dominated by linear instabilities.

The inverse of the escape rate deﬁnes a mean lifetime, T = 1/ǫ. Since the escape rate
decreases with increasing Reynolds number the mean lifetime increases. Since we have to
cut oﬀ the integration after a certain time, a more convenient measure is not the mean T
but the median TM = ln(2)T = ln(2)/ǫ, deﬁned as the time up to which half the states
have decayed. Both increase rapidly with Reynolds number, as shown in Fig. 7.

Below Re = 1800 the increase is mainly due to non-normal transient linear dynamics.
When the Reynolds number is increased above Re = 2000 the median of the turbulent
lifetimes as well as the ﬂuctuations rise rapidly until the median reaches the cut-oﬀ
lifetime of 2000 at Re ≈ 2200. The inset in Fig. 7 shows the inverse median lifetime
vs. Re and among the possible ﬁts for these data the most satisfactory ones supports a
divergence like (Rec − Re)−1, with Rec ≈ 2250. Such a divergence would be connected
with a transition from the chaotic saddle for lower Re to an attractor for larger Re.
However, it is known from other models that the lifetimes can increase rapidly without
a true singularity (T´el 1991; Crutchﬁeld & Kaneko 1988). However, even though the
question of whether we will arrive at a turbulent attractor cannot be answered here, it is
clear that with the rapid increase it will become an attractor for all practical purposes:
for a setup with length 1000 diameters the median will exceed this value for Reynolds
number about 2130. For this observation time the fraction of states with shorter lifetimes
drops from 80% of all initial conditions for Re = 2000 to 40% for Re = 2150 and to zero
for Re=2200. These numbers are obtained from the numerical simulations and include
the initial transient; numbers in other simulations and experiments may be diﬀerent, but
the rapid increase will remain the same.

An exponential distribution of lifetimes can be obtained for a constant probability to
decay. In view of the internal dynamics and the characteristic times connected with it,
one can interpret this as the probability to decay towards the laminar state at the end
of each turbulent regeneration cycle. The conclusion from the exponential distribution of
lifetimes is that this probability remains constant during the evolution, independent of
the ‘age’ of the trajectory.

It is worthwhile pointing out that the strong variation of the median lifetimes is not
reﬂected in the Lyapunov exponent, which increases only linearly: this shows that the
chaotic dynamics on the turbulent saddle and the escape from it are two diﬀerent pro-
cesses with independent characteristics.

There are two predictions that should be accessible to experimental investigation: the
behaviour near the boundary between laminar and turbulent and the exponential distri-
bution of lifetimes. The increase in lifetime for increasing perturbation amplitude can be
analyzed with a series of sensors along the pipe. The oscillations in Fig. 6a have a period
of about 200 time units, which translates into 200 diameters. Thus, if a perturbation can
be localized within a few radii, detectors that are further and further downstream might
be able to reproduce some of the oscillations in Figure 4 as the perturbation amplitude
is increased. Similarly, it might be possible to experimentally detect the Lyapunov expo-
nents in the ﬂow: with an uncertainty of about 5% in the preparation of initial conditions
and an Lyapunov exponent of about 0.07, the Lyapunov time will be about 40 units, i.e.
40 diameters. Thus, placing detectors at spacings of about 20 diameters apart should
allow a determination of the separation between ﬂow states starting from similar initial
conditions.

The second measurement is more easily performed: repeated runs with similar pertur-
bations give the probability to ﬁnd a turbulent state that exists at least up to time t.
The time can be varied again by placing detectors at diﬀerent locations along the pipe.
As explained, the exponential distribution of lifetimes is a property of the turbulent state
in the transition region and will not depend critically on the type of initial conditions

used. Exact reproduction of an initial condition is hence not essential here since all ini-
tial conditions relax to the same turbulent state. The median lifetime increases rapidly
with Reynolds number, from about 220 at Re = 1800 to 750 at Re = 2100. Given the
experimental limitations on the length of the pipe this region looks like a promising
range for experiments. The mechanism studied here, the formation of a chaotic saddle, is
fairly independent of the boundary conditions, but the quantitative characteristics may
dependent on it. Since the experiments will not have periodic boundary conditions in
downstream direction and since the turbulence may be localized in puﬀs or slugs it will
be interesting to see whether this will aﬀect the lifetimes or its distribution.

A detailed analysis of the distribution of lifetimes is a task which is still much better
suited for experiments than for numerics: it is not necessary to prepare the initial distur-
bance with highest precision, and the experimental observation time is of the order of 1
minute for an experimental run, followed by about half an hour for the water to return
to rest in the head-tank. On the other hand, a single trajectory in our computation takes
up to 10 days.

The picture that emerges from these data is that the transition to turbulence in pipe
ﬂow is connected with the formation of a chaotic saddle. The turbulent dynamics is
chaotic, the lifetimes are exponentially distributed and the transition depends sensi-
tively on the initial state. The same characteristics have been found in other shear ﬂows
without a linear instability as well (Schmiegel & Eckhardt 1997; Eckhardt et al. 2002;
Bottin et al. 1998; Faisst & Eckhardt 2000). The recent discovery of travelling waves in
pipe ﬂow for Reynolds numbers as low as 1250 (Faisst & Eckhardt 2003; Wedin & Kerswell
2003) strengthens this picture by providing some of the states around which the network
of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections that carry the chaotic saddle may form.

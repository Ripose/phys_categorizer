The Surface Green Function Matching analysis (SGFM) is used to study the normal modes of the
interface oscillations between two non-mixed ﬂuids by considering the diﬀerence in their densities
and viscosities. The limiting case of viscous-inviscid system is used for comparison. The role of the
viscosity and the density ratios on the momentum exchange and on the polarization of the surface
modes is analyzed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The theory of surface waves in ﬂuids is usually treated using the Orr-Sommerfeld equation obtained from potential
method [1]. This procedure is useful to ﬁnd the characteristics of the wave, such as dispersion relation and damping
but becomes rather complicated when some other features are needed such as polarization and density of modes.

On the other hand, the inclusion of the viscosities of all of the media make diﬃcult to understand the physics of the
interface. Broadly speaking, the dual eﬀects of viscosity is well known [1]: to dissipate the energy of any disturbance,
but also it has the more complicated eﬀect of diﬀusing momentum. At present, the theory for viscous cases is not
nearly as complete or general as for inviscid cases and it provides only a partial understanding of the role of viscosity
in such systems.

A suitable formalism for including all the viscosities with great ease in non-homogeneous systems studying the
response function has been developed elsewhere [2–5]. This formalism, the method of Surface Green Function Matching
(SGFM), has been extensively used to study various inhomogeneous problems involving surface waves at solid surfaces,
both free solid surface (interface between vacuum and solid) and solid-solid interfaces [6]. It has also been used in
interface involving ﬂuids [2,4] as is the case of solid-ﬂuid interface and even ﬂuid-ﬂuid interface (this last case analyzed
to give an uniﬁed treatment of waves in solids and ﬂuids which seem to be apparently unconnected problems). As
far as we know, there are no previous works where the SGFM have been applied to the hydrodynamics problems as
these authors suggested.

The aim of this paper is to apply the SGFM to the study of the physical characteristics (dispersion relation, damping
and polarization) on the interface normal modes of two ﬂuids at rest giving insight of the mechanisms of momentum
exchange through the interface for diﬀerent ratios between the viscosity and density of the two media.

In the next section a brief outline of the main points of the SGFM is given for the ﬂuid-ﬂuid system at rest,
highlighting the considerations made in the solution of the problem. Section III is devoted to the physical analysis
of the polarization of the modes and the momentum exchange across the interface. In section IV it is carried out a
numerical evaluation considering the physical interpretation of the terms and the results for pair of ﬂuids which are
analyzed as illustration. Finally some conclusions are outlined.

II. SGFM FOR TWO VISCOUS FLUIDS INCLUDING SURFACE EFFECTS

The formal development of the SGFM method has been fully explained elsewhere [2,5] and in particular the
treatment of matching with discontinuities [3], suitable for the case of two non mixed ﬂuids where the interface has
special eﬀects not seen in the liquid bulk. Mathematical and formal details can be found elsewhere [2] and need not

be repeated here. It is only necessary to add that in ﬂuid-ﬂuid interfaces it is better to work with the velocity of the
ﬂuid particle in agreement with the Navier-Stokes equation, instead of the ﬂuid particle deformation, suitable when
solids are present.

Consider a system formed by a ﬂuid M1 for z < 0 and a ﬂuid M2 for z > 0, both of them at rest. It has a planar
interface at z = 0. Analysing ﬁrst each bulk media individually to prepare its description in a suitable way for the
eventual matching at the interface, the coordinate system will be choosen considering the planes z =const as those of
interest. The notation will be for coordinates r = (ρ, z), k = (κ, q) where ρ and κ are 2D vectors.

As explained in [5], the SGFM start with the knowledge of the Green function G.F of the excitation studied in
each bulk material constituent. Then, it is needed to analyze the physical model for the excitation to perform later
matching at the interface.

Now, to know the G.F of each bulk media, the 3D diﬀerential equations of hydrodynamics are the starting point.
The ﬂuids are usually treated as incompressible and described with the Navier-Stokes equation. However, as explained
in [3], it proves convenient here to give the theory for compressible ﬂuids, even if compressibility eﬀects are ultimately
neglected. Then, the equation of mass for isoentropic processes, and the momentum conservation equation that
govern the ﬂuid motion are linearized by neglecting all nonlinear terms in disturbance quantities. They may be
written, respectively, as

(2)

where c, p, ρ, η and η′ are the velocity of sound, dynamical pressure, equillibrium density, shear and bulk viscosities
respectively, all of them considered as constants in each medium. V (r, t) is the velocity of the ﬂuid. We neglected
the external forces and supposed that the perturbation is small enough to neglect the convective term for pressure in
(1).

All space and time dependent quantities will be Fourier transformed according to exp[i(κ · ρ − ωt)] where ω is
a frequency. Then, for surface wave propagation, the amplitudes are functions of (κ, ω) on one hand and of z on
the other. This z dependence is due to the fact that there is no spatial invariance in this direction and the Fourier
transform can not be accomplished. Green functions, including the ones for the bulk material constituents, are then
conveniently expressed as G(κ, ω; z, z ′) or, simply, as G(z, z ′), with (κ, ω) understood everywhere.

Time Fourier transform will be implied now on. From eq. (1) it is obtained p(r, ω) = (ρc2/iω)∇ · V (r, ω), which

putted in eq. (2) gives rise to

as the system of equations which couples the velocity components. This system must be solved as a whole as it can
not be decoupled in the general case.

The actual G(z, z ′) of each bulk media considered separately as inﬁnity can be obtained in diﬀerent ways but using,

for instance, the Fourier transform 3D, it yields for the G.F [5]:

G(k, ω) =

where I is the unit matrix and kk is a diadic product of the wave vector.

describe the transverse and longitudinal modes of the inﬁnite medium. In (5) the incompressible ﬂuid can be considered
taking (¯Γ → ∞) and the proper limit is achieved.

There is no physical reason for the preference of a particular direction in the xy-plane. This spatial symmetry of
the system allows us to deﬁne, for instance, k = (0, κ, q) without loosing generality but getting simpliﬁcation of the
calculations.

Note that q l → i|κ| if the compressibility is neglected, see eq. (4), given rise to a vanishing longitudinal mode. So,

the q l pole describes the longitudinal mode due to the compressibility of the media.

Let GS be the Green function (G.F) of the surface system just deﬁned and GS its surface projection. Let G−1
S
be the reciprocal of GS in the two-dimensional ρ or κ space. This is the central object in the SGFM analysis. In
particular, knowing G−1
S it is possible to ﬁnd the surface mode dispersion relation (SMDR) and the density of modes
of the surface system [2]. It is important to stress that the secular equation for the SMDR, namely

det G−1

S = 0

(7)

expresses the continuity of the velocity and the stress components transmitted across z = 0. This is where the physics
of the surface eﬀects comes into the picture. These eﬀects introduce changes in the stress components transmitted
across the interface and are ultimately measured by some surface tensor mS whose physical meaning is that mS,
acting on the velocity ﬁeld V , yields the extra forces per unit area transmitted across the interface.

Let us call G−1

SO to G−1

S in the absence of such surface eﬀects, then one ﬁnds [3]

Thus the problem is to ﬁnd mS for the surface eﬀects one wishes to study. It will be included in this case only the

surface tension γ according to Laplace’s Law. It can be deduced [3] that

There is a little diﬀerence between the former expression and the expression obtained in [3] according to the fact

that here the velocity of the ﬂuid particle is considered instead the ﬂuid particle deformation.

Then, eq. (8) expresses the continuity of the velocities and the stress components transmitted across the interface at
S one can ﬁnd the dispersion relation of the surface modes (SMDR) through the secular equation

We shall refer to the modes as sagittal or S polarized with (0, Vy, Vz ), transverse tangent or TT(Vx, 0, 0), longitudinal

or L(0, Vy, 0) and transverse normal or TN(0, 0, Vz) modes, according to the component of the velocity they have.

Now, on using (10) in (7) the factorisation of the (G−1

S )11 matrix element yields a TT mode which does not interact

with the others, whose dispersion relation is

and has x-axis polarization.

η1qt1 + η2qt2 = 0

(14)

3

It is easily seen according to (6) that the TT mode has no solution but as stressed in [4], it does contribute to the
density of modes and therefore plays a non trivial role in the physical properties of the interface. This mode exists
but it is not a stationary one if there is other surface eﬀects considered [4].

The rest of (10) yields the secular equation

det g−1

S = 0

(15)

The factor (g−1

S )22 is a z direction surface movement. The factor (g−1

It gives a sagittal mode with polarization S(0, Vy, Vz ) and surface tension included. It will be analyzed in the following.
S )11, see eq. (11), represents the surface movement component in y direction due to compressibility
of the media while (g−1
S )12 represents a coupling between y
and z movements giving rise to an S polarization mode. It means that the surface has both horizontal and vertical
movements. In other words, the surface particles move in a kind of circular orbits depending of its phase diﬀerence.
On the other hand, there are no important velocities in our system, then compressibility can be neglected as
described in [2] and we will discuss whether the S polarization remains or not. Putting q l = i|κ| in (11), (12) and
(13) it is obtained

First of all let us consider the special case where the viscosity of M1 is neglected. If we put η1 = 0 in (16)-(18) it

Note that even though the viscosity of one of the constitutient media was neglected, the coupled factor remains
due to the nonzero viscosity of the other ﬂuid. So, in this limit this mode remains as sagittal S(0, Vy , Vz) exhibiting
movements in y- and z-axis for the surface particles. The ﬂuid was taken as incompressible but there is still a
component of velocity on y-direction. As far as we know, nobody has ever pointed out this fact clear, except Lucassen
in his works [7–10], who considered incompressible ﬂuids, but the movement in y-axis was due to active materials on
the surface, no as an eﬀect of viscosity. This coupling of movements could be responsible for a less wavelength and a
bigger dissipation as it will be seen later. It is in this direction where the viscosity plays an important role.
S )11 and (g−1

There is more information in eqs. (16)-(18). If viscosities are neglected (η1 = η2 = 0) in (g−1

S )12 these
S )22 does not yield a vanishing result. This

expressions vanish because qt1 → ∞, qt2 → ∞, but doing the same in (g−1
leads to:

S = (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

0

0

0 ρ1ω2 + ρ2ω2 − γκ2|κ| (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

The non zero component of Eq. (20) is a generalization of the Kelvin dispersion relation when the density of the

upper medium is included.

Then, it is concluded that when there is no viscosities the S polarized mode becomes TN mode because the coupled
factor disappears and only remains (g−1
S )22. Indeed, if at least one of the viscosities is considered the coupled factor
appears giving rise to the S mode, (see eq. (19)). Hence, the viscosity is the fundamental force which couples diﬀerent
modes among them.

Furthermore, the viscosity is the main cause of momentum exchange between the two media through the surface
on the y-direction movement. Note that the longitudinal component movement disappears according to (g−1
S )11 → 0
when η1 and η2 are neglected. On the other hand, in (15) the transverse normal movement described by (g−1
S )22
exists because of the densities and viscosities of the media, (see eq. (17)). When the viscosities are neglected as in
(20), the normal component movement still remains because of the densities of the ﬂuids. Hence, in the case of the
z-axis movement both the viscosities and densities are important for the exchange of momentum.

4

These results are in agreement to the fact that when the interface particle moves according to the longitudinal
mode it remains on the plane z = 0 and the viscosities are the only way for the two media to interact, but when the
interface particle moves according to the transverse normal mode it goes into each medium sometimes at z > 0 and
other at z < 0 and then the inertial eﬀects of the media become important according to their densities.

Expressions (15)-(18) also recover the Kelvin equation for an ideal ﬂuid with free surface, (see references in [9,1]).

Neglecting the viscosities, and setting ρ1 = 0 it is obtained

g−1

S = (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

0

0

0 ρ2ω2 − γκ2|κ| (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

(21)

It can be seen that our formalism not only recovers the expression for the Kelvin equation, but also recovers the

z-polarization of that mode.

After this analysis one can return back to the problem for both viscous ﬂuids. From (15)-(18) it is obtained the

secular equation for the SMDR

ω2(cid:2)(ρ1 + ρ2)(ρ1qt2 + ρ2qt1) − |κ|(ρ1 − ρ2)2(cid:3) + γκ2|κ| [ρ1(|κ| − qt2) + ρ2(|κ| − qt1)] +
+ 4κ2|κ|(η2 − η1)2(|κ| − qt1)(|κ| − qt2) + 4iκ2ω(η2 − η1)(ρ1|κ| − ρ2|κ| − ρ1qt2 + ρ2qt1) = 0

(22)

with the following new deﬁnition of qt = (κ2 − iρω/η)1/2. This expression, which we recall corresponds to two
viscous non mixed incompressible ﬂuids, can also be accomplished applying the potential method, although using
that formalism it is rather diﬃcult to obtain the polarization of the modes.

This is the equation to be used to study the modes if one includes both viscosities and surface tension eﬀects for
incompressible ﬂuids. Expression (22) was reported in [4] to study the surface waves at the interface between a solid
and a ﬂuid. They neglected the surface tension. One of the aim of this paper is to compare this theory with the
theory which just take into account only one of the viscosities. From expression (19) it is not diﬃcult to achive the
SMDR for the viscous-inviscid ﬂuid interface

− ω2ρ2(ρ1 + ρ2) + γκ2|κ|ρ2 + 4κ2|κ|η2

2(|κ| − qt2) − 4iρ2ωκ2η2 = 0

(23)

which reduces to equation (2.5) of [4] when γ = 0 and will be evaluated in the next section along with (22) for the
viscous case.

Then the characteristics of the system will be studied by its SMDR with real values of the frequency ω. Let us
allow κ to be complex, its real part is 2π times the inverse of the wavelength and the imaginary part is the distance
damping coeﬃcient β related with the viscosities of the media. The dimensionless parameters are κo = 2π/Lo and
ωo = 2π/To.

Fig. 1 shows the SMDR for Q = 0.8. There is one mode which decreases its wavelength λ and increases its distance
damping coeﬃcient β with increasing frequency at a ﬁxed value of the parameter N . It is also shown that when the
viscosity ratio N is increased the wavelength lightly decreases at any frequency. The curves split bigger at higher
frequencies. On the other hand β increases with increasing N . Also it was plotted the curves obtained with N = 0
from eq. (26) which means zero viscosity of the medium M1. It can be seen that the theory which includes all the
viscosities predicts small λ and bigger β for a ﬁxed ω with respect to the N = 0 case.

Fig. 2 shows the dependence of κ and β with respect to the variation of the density ratio Q at a ﬁxed value of the
frequency and viscosity ratio. It can be seen that λ decreases when Q increases at a ﬁxed N . This was deduced by
Taylor in his study of the ripple formation on an inﬁnitely thick viscous circular jet but neglecting the air viscosity.
References are given in [11]. We now prove that this is also true when both viscosities are considered. Also λ decreases
at a ﬁxed Q when the viscosity ratio N takes higher values. So, the eﬀect of the viscosity of medium M1 reinforces
the eﬀect produced by the density and it can be stated that the smaller wavelength will be obtained when Q and N
are both bigger. It is also plotted the curve with N = 0 corresponding to the viscous-inviscid case. It can be seen that
the wavelength is always smaller in the case N 6= 0 (viscous-viscous case). The curves split bigger as Q increases and
β grows rapidly at low values of Q for a ﬁxed value of N and tends to saturation for higher values of Q. This small
variation of β with the variation of Q even at a ﬁxed value of the viscosity ratio N reinforces the idea of the density
as another mechanism of momentum exchange between the two media through the interface. It not only produces
smaller wavelengths, but also produces lightly bigger distance damping coeﬃcients β.

On the other hand, the distance damping coeﬃcient β also increases at higher values of the viscosity ratio N at
a ﬁxed Q. It was also plotted the curves at N = 0. It is interesting to note that the theory of viscous-inviscid case
predicts a small decrease of the distance damping coeﬃcient with increasing density ratio Q. This is in accordance
to the fact that setting N = 0 means to neglect the momentum exchange through the interface by the viscosity and
raising Q represents to increase the dynamic properties of the surface given rise to a bigger distance for the wave to
travel before vanishing.

Fig. 3 shows the variation of λ and β with respect to the viscosity ratio for a ﬁxed value of ω at three values of Q.
It shows that as the viscosity ratio increases, the wavelength reduces rapidly ﬁrst and tends to a limiting value for
N ≥ 1. The curves start in the value of λ corresponding to the viscous-inviscid case. Also, for a ﬁxed value of N the
wavelength decreases as Q increases, in correspondence with Fig. 2. For the coeﬃcient β it is seen that it raises for
increasing N .

To illustrate this theory for real ﬂuid combinations there will be used three pairs of ﬂuids: air/water, water/aniline

and water/mercury. The parameters of these ﬂuids at room temperature are:

Element Density Viscosity Surface

mercury 13500
aniline

0.018
0.890
1.526
3.847

-

71.99
485.48
42.12

Then, for the system air/water it is Q = 0.0012 and N = 0.0202. In this case the SMDR is plotted in Fig. 4. It
can be seen that there is no diﬀerence of the wavelength reported by viscous-viscous and viscous-inviscid cases due
to the small values of the density and viscosity ratios but there is a small increase of β for all frequencies when the
air viscosity is considered.

However, the operating conditions in many gas turbine combustors and liquid-propellant rocket engines are such
that the density and viscosity ratios are higher. It could be so also in water-oil emulsions and other problems where
the interface between two ﬂuids plays an important role. Then, the SMDR for water/aniline (Q = 0.977, N = 0.231)
and water/mercury (Q = 0.074, N = 0.583) systems were also plotted. In the ﬁrst case (water/aniline) the densities
are very similar but the viscosity of the aniline is much bigger than the water viscosity. In the case of water/mercury
the viscosities are near one half one another, but the density of the mercury is much bigger the density of the water.
The SMDR has been plotted in Fig. 5 and 6. Note than in both cases the wavelength decreases and the distance
damping coeﬃcient increases in a visible way when the viscosity of the medium M1 (water in both cases) is considered.
The diﬀerence is bigger at high values of the frequency where the viscosity eﬀects become important. Then, one can
conclude that the inclusion of the viscosities of all media produces a substantial decrease of the wavelength if the
viscosity ratio are big enough. It gives rise also to a bigger distance damping coeﬃcient for the wave.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper the close relationship between the properties of low amplitude surface waves propagation with
the viscosity and density ratios, in a system of two non-mixed incompressible ﬂuids at rest has been set out. The
SGFM method was used to accomplish the dispersion relation and the full study of wave propagation by varying
diﬀerent parameters of the media.

It was shown that the viscosity is a fundamental parameter for the coupling of diﬀerent modes. It gives rise to an
S polarization mode with y and z components of the movement of the particles on the surface. Also it was seen that
the viscosity is the main force in producing momentum exchange in the longitudinal mode, but for the transverse
normal mode both the viscosity and the density ratios are important to the momentum exchange.

When considering surface modes, it was shown that only one of them is allowed and its wavelength is smaller when
considering the viscosity of both media for ﬁxed values of the density ratio. Also it was seen a characteristic variation
of the distance damping coeﬃcient when the viscosity of all media are included. On the other hand the increasing
of the density ratio also reduces the wavelength and produces a lightly increase of the distance damping coeﬃcient,
then this factor is also important in reducing the wavelength of the surface waves.

In order to see more real situations, three pair of ﬂuids were analyzed and the importance of taking in consideration

all the viscosities was shown.

FIG. 1. Dispersion relation of the surface mode for Q = 0.8. The upper part gives the wavelength κ/κo and the lower part

the distance damping coeﬃcient β/κo

FIG. 2. Relation between wavelength and distance coeﬃcient with respect to the density ratio at a ﬁxed frequency for

diﬀerent values of viscosity ratios. The case N = 0 is the viscous-inviscid case

FIG. 3. Relation between wavelength and distance coeﬃcient with respect to the viscosity ratio at a ﬁxed frequency for

diﬀerent values of density ratios

FIG. 4. Dispersion relation of the surface mode for the air/water system. In the legend it is especiﬁed the M1 as left and

M2 as right in the combination M1/M2, i. e., air/water in this ﬁgure.

Abstract. We summarize our ﬁndings about laterally periodic convection structures
in binary mixtures in the Rayleigh–B´enard system for positive Soret eﬀect. Stationary
roll, square, and crossroll solutions and their stability are determined with a multi-
mode Galerkin expansion. The oscillatory competition of squares and rolls in the form
of crossroll oscillations is reviewed. They undergo a subharmonic bifurcation cascade
where the oscillation period grows in integer steps as a consequence of an entrainment
process.

1 Introduction

The Rayleigh–B´enard system is a prominent example for studying pattern for-
mation in hydrodynamic systems driven away from equilibrium. In this system a
ﬂuid layer is conﬁned between two extended plates perpendicular to the direction
of gravity. A temperature diﬀerence between lower and upper plate is applied.
Below a critical temperature diﬀerence a quiescent conductive state is estab-
lished wherein the temperature varies linearly between the plates. But for larger
diﬀerences buoyancy forces are strong enough to destabilize this conductive state
and to start convection.

The pure ﬂuid convection in the Rayleigh–B´enard system at moderate heat-
ing rates is experimentally and theoretically well investigated [1]. An extension
of the problem that leads to more complex convection behavior is achieved by
using binary mixtures such as ethanol-water instead. In binary mixtures the
buoyancy forces are also inﬂuenced by concentration variations. The structural
dynamics of the concentration distribution in mixtures results from an interplay
between three competing mechanisms: nonlinear advection and mixing, weak
solutal diﬀusion, and the Soret eﬀect. The latter generates and sustains con-
centration gradients in linear response to local temperature gradients. Without
Soret coupling measured by the separation ratio any concentration ﬂuctuation
diﬀuses away.

Convection in binary mixtures shows a rich spectrum of pattern formation
behavior [1–3]. But the knowledge about these structures and in particular about
their stability is more limited than for pure ﬂuids. This is especially true for the
case of a positive Soret eﬀect where the fact that the novel structures are three-
dimensional makes their numerical investigation more diﬃcult.

A positive separation ratio implies that temperature diﬀerences drive the
lighter component of the mixture into the direction of higher temperature. That

2

means that the Soret eﬀect enhances the buoyancy forces that result from the
temperature dependence of the density. Convection is therefore established at
temperature diﬀerences smaller than those needed for pure ﬂuids. The interval
of temperature diﬀerences that allows convection in a binary mixture but not yet
in a pure ﬂuid is called Soret region. Therein convection is driven only because of
the presence of the solutal contribution to the buoyancy force. Above this range,
i. e. in the Rayleigh region, the thermal part of the buoyancy is most important
and the Soret eﬀect is less eﬀective for destabilizing the conductive state.

In the Soret region square-like convection patterns are often found as the
primary stable form of convection whereas in pure ﬂuids roll patterns are stable
at onset. Such rolls can also be found in binary mixtures, especially at higher
heating rates where convection is strong enough to reduce the concentration
variations suﬃciently by advective mixing. In between there exist two diﬀerent
kinds of crossroll structures: one is stationary and the other one is oscillatory.
In this article we

summarize our ﬁndings about laterally periodic convection structures for positive
separation ratios. In Sect. 2 we present the basic equations for binary mixture
convection in the Rayleigh–B´enard system and the Galerkin technique we used
to investigate the diﬀerent convection structures numerically. In Sects. 3 – 5 we
discuss the properties of rolls, squares, and crossrolls and their range of stability.
We conclude in Sect. 6.

2.1 System and Basic Equations

We consider a horizontal layer of a binary ﬂuid mixture of thickness d in a
homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld, g =

the ﬂuid layer.

component of the mixture is driven into the direction of higher temperature.
Concentration at the bottom is larger in the conductive state for positive ∆T
therefore enhancing the density gradient and further destabilizing the ﬂuid layer.
Convection is described in terms of the ﬁelds of T , C, velocity u = (u, v, w),
total mass density ̺, and pressure P . In the balance equations connecting these
ﬁelds we scale lengths and positions by d, time by the vertical thermal diﬀusion
time d2/Dth, temperature by νDth/αgd3, concentration by νDth/βgd3, and pres-
th/d2. Here ̺0 is the mean density, Dth the thermal diﬀusivity, ν the

kinematic viscosity, and α =

and solutal expansion coeﬃcients, respectively. Using the Oberbeck–Boussinesq

The ﬁrst equation (4a) expresses the fact that the ﬂuid is considered to be

hand sides of these equations are the substantial time derivatives of the respec-
tive ﬁelds. The driving forces entering into the momentum balance equation (4b)
are pressure gradients and the buoyancy caused by the temperature and concen-
tration dependence of the density. The remaining term on the right hand side is
the momentum diﬀusion term.

(4c) and (4d) contain also diﬀusion terms on the right hand side. The oﬀ-

centration currents and concentration gradients by temperature variations.

2.2 Galerkin Method

We are concerned with three-dimensional convection patterns periodic in the x-
and y-direction. To describe such patterns with wavenumbers kx and ky each
ﬁeld X is expanded as

(7)

(8)

(9)

X(x, y, z; t) =

Xlmn(t)eilkxxeimkyyfn(z) .

Xlmn

Here l and m are integers and the fn form a complete system of functions that
ﬁts the speciﬁc boundary condition for the ﬁeld X at the plates. To ﬁnd suitable
sets of functions fn we introduce some new ﬁelds. First, two scalar ﬁelds Φ and
Ψ are deﬁned via

u =

Ψ ez .

∇ ×

The structures we want to discuss do not show a horizontal mean ﬂow for mirror
symmetry reasons. Then, (8) is the most general expression that fulﬁlls the
incompressibility condition (4a) [11].

Second, instead of c we use the ﬁeld

ζ = c

ψθ

that allows in a more convenient way to guarantee the impermeability of the
horizontal boundaries: The diﬀusive part of the concentration current, driven
by concentration gradients as well as by temperature gradients is given by
ψθ). At the impermeable plates the vertical component of this current

The advective concentration current vanishes at the plates because there u = 0.
The balance equation for ζ is obtained by combining (4c) and (4d).

The boundary conditions for the ﬁelds Φ, Ψ, θ, and ζ read

By inserting the ansatz (7) for each ﬁeld into the balance equations and
projecting them onto the basic functions one gets a nonlinear algebraic system
of equations of the form

Aκµ∂tXµ = BκµXµ + Cκµν XµXν .

(14)

For simplicity amplitudes are labelled here by a single Greek index and the
summation convention is implied in (14) with Aκµ, Bκµ, and Cκµν being constant
coeﬃcients.

The number of modes has to be truncated to get a ﬁnite number of equations
as discussed later on. For stationary convection structures the left hand side of
(14) vanishes and the solution can be found using a multidimensional Newton
method.

2.3 Stability Analysis

To make a full stability analysis one has to check the stability of the patterns
against perturbations with arbitrary wavevector dex + bey. To do so one has to
introduce a Floquet term writing out the perturbation as

δX(x, y, z; t) = eidx+ibyest

δXlmneilkxx+imkyyfn(z) .

(15)

Xlmn

Such a perturbation is added to the known solution the stability of which is to be
tested and inserted into the balance equations. After linearizing and projecting
one gets a linear eigenvalue problem of the form

sAκµδXµ = BκµδXµ .

(16)

with constant coeﬃcients Aκµ and Bκµ. The aforementioned solution, i.e., the
convective structure described by it is stable if every eigenvalue s has a negative
real part for every d and b.

The symmetry of the convective pattern discussed above can under some cir-
cumstances be used to get separated classes of possible eigenvectors representing
the perturbations. That means the eigenvalue problem can be reduced to ﬁnding
the eigenvalues of two matrices of about half of the size. Because evaluating the
eigenvalues of a matrix is a O(N 3)-process this always implies a reduction of the
computation time.

2.4 Parameter Space

c = Rac(ψ = 0) = 1707.762 and a wavenumber k0

In pure ﬂuids convection in the Rayleigh–B´enard system starts at a critical
Rayleigh number Ra0
c = kc(ψ =
0) = 3.117 [8]. In binary mixtures with positive separation ratios that we are
dealing with, the critical Rayleigh number is smaller, Rac(ψ > 0) < Ra0
c, since
the solutal contribution to the quiescent state’s buoyancy force enhances the
latter. Thus a smaller thermal driving, i.e., a smaller Rayleigh number suﬃces
to reach the critical buoyancy force size for onset of convection. The critical
wavenumber is also somewhat lower: kc(ψ > 0) < k0
c [12]. When presenting our
results we shall use the reduced Rayleigh number

r =

Ra
Ra0
c

.

(17)

The convection above onset depends on the three parameters ψ, Le, and
P r. These parameters depend on the components of the mixture and the mean
values of temperature and concentration. For alcohol-water for example, ψ may
0.6 and 0.3. Here the Lewis number Le = 0.01 or
assume values between
1 is typical for gas mixtures. A typical Prandtl number
smaller whereas Le
for liquid mixtures is P r = 10, in gas mixtures P r = 0.1...1.

≈

−

3 Rolls

In pure ﬂuids, convection in the form of parallel rolls is a stable form of convec-
tion directly above onset for all values of P r [13], although they compete with
spiral defect chaos at low Prandtl numbers where the latter structure has a larger
basin of attraction [14]. In binary mixtures, they exist also as stable patterns
above Rac for all positive ψ if Le is large enough to equilibrate the concentration
suﬃciently. The required value of Le depends mainly on the strength of the Soret
eﬀect but also on the Prandtl number. The rolls lose stability against squares at
onset if Le is too small, especially for strong Soret coupling [15].

3.1 Technical Remarks

Calculating the ﬁxed point solutions and analyzing their stability requires less
numerical eﬀort than for 3D structures. Only Xl0n-modes have to be taken
into account and Ψ
0. Mirror symmetry in the lateral direction allows to set
Xl0n = X−l0n so that the lateral functions e±iklx can be replaced by cos(klx).
In addition the roll pattern is antisymmetric under reﬂection at the plane z = 0
combined with a translation by half a wavelength in x-direction. This mirror
glide symmetry enforces half of the amplitudes to be zero, e. g. all amplitudes
Φl0n where l + n is an odd number.

In special cases the system of equations can be separated even further. For
d = 0 the perturbations can be divided into those that are symmetric and those
that are antisymmetric under the operation x

then the perturbations contain either no or only δΨ -amplitudes. This is also of
practical interest, since some instabilities are most critical in these special cases.

3.2 Numerical Results

A quantitative description of the ﬁxed point solutions and the stability behavior
in binary mixtures requires in some cases sets of modes that are much larger
than those needed for pure ﬂuids. This is because the strong anharmonic narrow
boundary layer behavior of the ζ-ﬁeld for small Le and large r. For the most

In this case, two diﬀerent convection regimes can be distinguished. For r < 1,
in the Soret regime, the applied temperature gradients cause convection only
indirectly, by generating concentration and therefore density gradients via the
Soret eﬀect. The convection amplitudes are very small here. This changes in the

Stability Properties of Rolls

The stability boundaries of roll patterns in pure ﬂuids are known since the pio-
neering work of Busse and his coworkers [13]. At small Rayleigh numbers there
exist ﬁve diﬀerent instability mechanisms giving rise to ﬁve diﬀerent stabil-
ity boundaries that limit the region of stable rolls in the (Ra, k, P r)-parameter
space. At small Prandtl numbers the Eckhaus (EC), the skewed varicose (SV),
and the oscillatory mechanism (OS) are the important instabilities [19]. At
higher Prandtl numbers the zigzag (ZZ) and the crossroll (CR) mechanisms
dominate [20]. Properties and symmetries of these perturbations are discussed
in [21]. These ﬁve instabilities of roll patterns are the same as those that can
be found in binary mixtures. A more detailed discussion of the symmetries and
other features of these mechanisms can be found in [16].

The central qualitative diﬀerence between roll structures in pure ﬂuids and
binary mixtures concerning their stability is certainly their loss of stability in
mixtures at onset in a wide range of parameter space. However, roll structures

do in general still exist in mixtures as stable structures for these parameters,
not at onset, but at larger r. Figure 2 shows the CR instability boundaries of
rolls in a parameter interval where an exchange of stability between rolls and
squares at onset is predicted in [15]. One sees that the curvature of the CR
boundary at the critical point diverges – a feature that follows also from cubic
amplitude equations, see [16] – when this exchange occurs. For the parameters
P r = 10, ψ = 0.01 of Fig. 2 the exchange occurs at Le = 0.2. Decreasing Le
below this value the neutral stability curve (dashed line in Fig. 2) drops further

from the neutral stability curve and moves up in r. Above the CR boundary
rolls are still stable against CR perturbations.

The rolls could still be unstable there against other perturbations but we
found the minimum of the CR boundary always to be the minimal Rayleigh
number above which stable rolls exist. Only at ψ = 0.15, P r < 0.2 and Le <
0.015 we found regions where rolls seem to be unstable everywhere in the (k, r)-
plane. The two branches of the CR boundary meet again at higher r near this
region and limit an oval region of CR-stable rolls from below and also above.
The oval region gets smaller by reducing Le or P r until the region of stable
rolls vanishes. The experimental observation of this behavior might be diﬃcult
because it occurs in a region of the parameter space that is not accessible by
ordinary ﬂuid mixtures.

We have calculated all stability boundaries at small r for diﬀerent values
of Le, ψ, and P r. Concerning the stability behavior of the roll structures one
sees that in the Rayleigh region, r > 1, where the concentration ﬁeld is nearly
uniform the binary mixture behaves like a pure ﬂuid. As for the ﬁxed points,
the transition between Soret and Rayleigh region is very sharp at small Le and

ψ. An example for such a behavior is given in Fig. 3. Here only the EC, CR,
and ZZ boundaries are of importance. In the Rayleigh region of Fig. 3 the CR,
ZZ, and EC boundaries of the mixture (full lines with circles, triangles, and
squares, respectively) are lying close to the corresponding boundaries of the
pure ﬂuid (long-dashed lines). Note in particular the vase-like form of the EC
boundary rEC(k) and the dent in the ZZ boundary rZZ(k): Closer to onset (rc
≃
0.6, kc
2.6 in Fig. 3), i.e., in the Soret regime rEC(k) opens up parabolically
and rZZ(k) comes out of the critical point linearly with positive slope. However,
in the crossover range r
1 between Soret and Rayleigh regime the curve
rEC(k) pinches inwards and develops a waist such as to follow in the Rayleigh
regime the parabolic shape of the EC curve of the pure ﬂuid that starts out at
k0
c = 1. Similarly rZZ(k) bends in the crossover range towards small k
c ≃
to follow then the ZZ boundary of the pure ﬂuid that shows negative slope.

3.1, r0

≃

∼

Figure 4 show that this transition between Soret and Rayleigh region that
causes the vase-like structure of the EC boundary and the sharp bend of the ZZ
boundary is smoother for larger Le or ψ. For Le = 1, the stability balloon does
not qualitatively diﬀer from its pure ﬂuid counterpart.

4 Squares

Convection in square patterns is a ﬁxed point solution that bifurcates out of
the conductive state and that coexists with the roll solution. For parameter
combinations where rolls are not stable at onset, square structures gain stability.
They lose stability at higher r, roughly at the boundary between Soret and
Rayleigh region.

4.1 Technical Remarks

Squares have the same symmetry plane at x = 0 as rolls and an additional
mirror plane at y = 0. Furthermore, squares show also a mirror glide symmetry.
Here, however, the symmetry transformation consists of a reﬂection at the plane
z = 0 combined with a translation by half a wavelength in x- and y-direction. To
describe these three-dimensional patterns the Ψ -ﬁeld cannot be neglected. We
also mention that in contrast to the other ﬁelds Ψ is odd in x and y and has
positive parity under the mirror glide operation thereby reﬂecting the symmetries
of the velocity ﬁeld. A further reduction of the number of mode occurs since
square patterns are invariant under rotation by 90◦ mapping the x- onto the
y-directions and vice versa. Amplitudes like Φlmn and Φmln are the same. This
is also true for θ and ζ. Again Ψ is diﬀerent. Here Ψlmn =

Ψmln.

Because the amount of computational power needed to make a full stability
analysis of these three-dimensional structures is too large, we will discuss per-
turbations only for periodic boundary conditions, i. e., d = b = 0. Here again a
separation of perturbations is possible into those that change sign or not under
the mirror glide operation. Furthermore, the stability problem is invariant under
y. Thus one can distinguish between perturbations that are

In Fig. 5 we show the concentration distribution of square convection for two
parameter combinations that are representative for liquid and gas mixtures.
This plot and the concentration ﬁeld structure of rolls and squares in a vertical
cross section shows a characteristic boundary layer and plume behavior at small
Le. Such structures occur when advective mixing is large compared to diﬀusion
in the bulk of the ﬂuid. Consequently the boundary layers and plumes are more
pronounced in rolls than in squares since the leading velocity amplitudes are
greater for the former. Thus squares with their broader boundary layers are
much smoother structures than rolls at the same parameters. The practically
harmonic velocity and temperature ﬁelds are not shown.

Stability Properties of Squares

Performing the stability analysis of squares we had to restrict ourselves to the
case d = b = 0 where the perturbations separate into diﬀerent symmetry classes.
Because both squares and rolls can be described as even in x and y and as mirror
glide antisymmetric, one expects a perturbation that destabilizes the squares and
favors the rolls to fulﬁll these symmetries, too. However such a perturbation
should break the symmetry x
y. We actually always found the most critical
perturbation to fall into this symmetry class. Other perturbations that break
the mirror symmetry in x- or y-direction are less critical.

↔

Figure 6 shows typical examples for the stability region of squares. The left
and right side of the stability boundaries should not be taken too serious –
presumably square structures are destabilized earlier by instabilities with ﬁnite
b or d that tune the wavenumber and that are not considered here.

Even if squares are stable at onset they always lose their stability against a
roll pattern at higher r. Furthermore, for certain parameters there does also exist

a band of r-values where neither squares nor rolls are stable. Therein crossrolls
or oscillations appear as stable patterns.

5 Crossrolls

Crossrolls are 3D convection patterns that show the same symmetries as squares
except the x
y symmetry. As squares, they can be qualitatively described as
superpositions of perpendicular roll patterns. But in the case of crossrolls the
amplitudes Φ101 and Φ011 of the x- and y-rolls are not the same.

↔

Crossroll structures appear in two modiﬁcations: as stationary and as os-
cillatory crossrolls. For the latter, the amplitudes of x- and y-rolls are time
dependent.

anymore due to the lack of the x
y symmetry. For b = d = 0 instabilities are
either mirror glide symmetric or antisymmetric. They are either even or odd in
the x- and the y-direction. We used expansions up to N2 = 20 to investigate these
structures. The time-dependent structures were investigated via direct numerical
integration of the equations of motion for the modes.

5.2 Numerical Results

Stationary crossrolls exist at parameters P r, L, ψ if squares are stable at onset.
Then, they appear in the r-range were squares are already and rolls are still
unstable. Oscillatory crossrolls exist only at small Le. The connection between
the diﬀerent structures can be extracted from the bifurcation diagram in Fig. 7.
For the parameters P r = 27, Le = 0.0047, and ψ = 0.23 taken from [5], all
four kinds of patterns exist. For the calculation of the ﬁxed points a model with
N2 = 10 was used, the bifurcation diagram is therefore only qualitatively correct
at higher r.

The stationary crossrolls exist always inside an intermediate r-range if squares
are stable at onset. The oscillatory type appears only at very small Le as in
Fig. 7. If these solutions are absent, the squares transfer their stability directly
to the stationary crossroll branch, leading to a sequence squares – stationary
crossrolls – rolls of stable structures for increasing r. In particular, the stability
boundaries that limit the region of stable squares in Fig. 6 are all of the type
leading to stationary rolls: oscillatory crossrolls do not exist for these parameters.

Oscillatory Crossrolls

But for the parameters in Fig. 7 the bifurcation behavior is more complicated.
The squares lose their stability already at r
1.08 before the stationary cross-
rolls emerge. At this point oscillatory crossrolls grow out of the square state in a
supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The stationary crossrolls that appear at r = 1.11
remain unstable until r

cost of the y-roll intensity, however, without ever going to zero. Thus the two
roll sets never die out completely or reverse their turning direction during the
oscillations. Close to the Hopf bifurcation the oscillations are harmonic and of
small amplitude (Fig. 8a). With increasing r the frequency decreases roughly
linearly [5]. Furthermore, and more importantly, with increasing amplitude the
oscillation becomes more anharmonic and relaxational in Fig. 8b, c; see also
Ref. [4,5]: While the system rapidly sweeps through the square state it spends
more and more time in the vicinity of the roll state. The change from harmonic
in Fig. 8a to strongly relaxational oscillations in Fig. 8c is also documented in

At larger r the system gets attracted into one of the crossroll ﬁxed points
that have become stable shortly before oscillatory crossrolls cease to exist
in
Fig. 7. In this interval we have observed a novel subharmonic bifurcation cascade
(SC) in which the crossroll attractors entrain the oscillations: First the crossroll
attractors deform the phase trajectory (Fig. 8c). Then with increasing r the
oscillations execute an increasing number of windings around the crossroll states.
In Figs. 8c – f the winding number around a crossroll ﬁxed point increases from
n = 1 to n = 4 and the period τ of the oscillations increases from 2π/ω to 2πn/ω
in integer steps. This increase of the winding number in the SC continues beyond

n = 4; we have found also n = 5. However, the control parameter interval δrn
for an n-cycle becomes so narrow – δrn ∼= (1.6, 0.6, 0.2)10−4 for n = (2, 3, 4) –
that our numerical resources were not suﬃcient to resolve the SC further. But
we think that the SC is a robust, experimentally accessible phenomenon; Ref. [4]
contains a hint for a 2-cycle. Beyond the SC interval in the system gets attracted
into one of the crossroll ﬁxed points. The transition between the oscillations and
the crossroll state is slightly hysteretic. Upon reducing r the system remains
in the crossroll state until below the SC interval and then a transition to an
n = 1 oscillation occurs. So in a small r-interval there is bistable coexistence of
oscillations and stationary crossrolls.

6 Conclusion

≤

We reviewed our ﬁndings of Rayleigh–B´enard convection in binary mixtures
with positive Soret eﬀect. In this case the lighter component of the mixture is
driven into the direction of higher temperature. The enhanced density gradient
leads to a convective instability at smaller temperature diﬀerences than in the
pure ﬂuid case. Convection at positive ψ shows a rich variety of stable structures
at moderate r

1.5.

Using the Galerkin technique, we investigated two- and three-dimensional lat-
erally periodic patterns as rolls, squares, and stationary and oscillatory cross-
rolls and determined their stability behavior. All these patterns are realized
as stable convection structures somewhere in parameter space. The numerical
examination of convection in liquid binary mixtures is in general much more dif-
ﬁcult compared to pure ﬂuids since small values of the Lewis number Le
0.01
lead to a pronounced narrow boundary layer behavior of the concentration ﬁeld.
This is especially the case for rolls whereas squares are somewhat smoother.
Nevertheless we had to restrict the stability analysis of the three-dimensional
structures to perturbations with the same wave number.

At higher Le roll structures are stable directly above onset and crossrolls
structures do not appear. The analysis of the rolls shows that in the explored
parameter range only the basic mechanisms of instability occur that are already
known from the pure ﬂuid, namely the Eckhaus, zigzag, crossroll, oscillatory,
and skewed varicose mechanism. When the Soret region is small, the stability
balloon of the mixtures resembles the Busse balloon for the pure ﬂuid. However,
at small Le when the Soret region is large the situation is diﬀerent. The ﬁxed
point solutions show a sharp transition between the two regimes. The convection
amplitudes are very small in the Soret regime. But near r = 1 they increase
strongly and become comparable to those of the pure ﬂuid convection. The
stability boundaries of roll convection show a similar
transition here. In the
Rayleigh region the boundaries are close to the boundaries of the pure ﬂuid. But
upon reducing the Rayleigh number the boundaries begin to deviate from their
pure ﬂuid counterparts. Near onset they ﬁnally agree with the predictions of the
amplitude equations for the mixtures.

We consider the turbulent energy dissipation from one-dimensional records in experiments using
air and gaseous helium at cryogenic temperatures, and obtain the intermittency exponent via the
two-point correlation function of the energy dissipation. The air data are obtained in a number of
ﬂows in a wind tunnel and the atmospheric boundary layer at a height of about 35 m above the
ground. The helium data correspond to the centerline of a jet exhausting into a container. The air
data on the intermittency exponent are consistent with each other and with a trend that increases
with the Taylor microscale Reynolds number, Rλ, of up to about 1000 and saturates thereafter. On
the other hand, the helium data cluster around a constant value at nearly all Rλ, this being about
half of the asymptotic value for the air data. Some possible explanation is oﬀered for this anomaly.

INTRODUCTION

That turbulent energy dissipation is intermittent in
space has been known since the seminal work of Batche-
lor & Townsend [1]. The characteristics of intermittency
are best expressed, at present, in terms of multifractals
and the multiplicity of scaling exponents; see e.g. Ref. [2].
In the hierarchy of the scaling exponents, the so-called
intermittency exponent characterizing the second-order
behavior of the energy dissipation, is the most basic. In
this paper, we address the Reynolds number variation of
the intermittency exponent and its asymptotic value (if
one exists).

The intermittency exponent has been determined by
a number of authors in the past using several diﬀerent
methods; for a summary as of some years ago, see Refs.
[3, 4]. Recently, Cleve, Greiner & Sreenivasan [5] evalu-
ated these methods and showed that the best procedure is
to examine the scaling of the two-point correlation func-
tion hε(x + d)ε(x)i of the energy dissipation ε. Other
l i and hln2 εli − hln εli2
procedures based on moments hε2
l ε(x)dx, or
of the coarse-grained dissipation εl = (1/l)
the power-spectrum P (k) = |ε(k)|2, are corrupted by the
R
unavoidable surrogacy of the observed energy dissipation.
The follow-up eﬀort [6] was able to characterize and un-
derstand the functional form of the two-point correlation
function beyond the power-law scaling range. Within
the theory of (binary) random multiplicative cascade pro-
cesses, the ﬁnite-size parametrization

was derived, introducing the cascade length Lcasc as a
meaningful physical upper length scale, this being sim-

ilar to the integral scale (as discussed later) but typi-
cally larger. Here, µ is the intermittency exponent, and
the ﬁrst term is the pure power-law part and the sec-
ond term is the ﬁnite-size correction. Comments on the
constant c will be given further below. The one atmo-
spheric and the three wind tunnel records employed in
Ref. [6] were found to be in accordance with this close-
to-universal ﬁnite-size parametrization. Even for ﬂows at
moderate Taylor-microscale Reynolds numbers Rλ, Eq.
(1) allowed an unambiguous extraction of µ. For the
four data records, a weak dependence of µ on Rλ was
observed in [6] but was not commented upon in any de-
tail. The present analysis examines many more records
and attempts to put that Reynolds number dependence
on ﬁrmer footing.

II. THE DATA

Two of the data records examined here come from the
atmospheric boundary layer (records a1 and a2) [7], eight
records from a wind tunnel shear ﬂow (records w1 to w8)
[8] and eleven records from a gaseous helium jet ﬂow
(records h1 to h11) [9]. We ﬁnd that all air experiments
show an increasing trend of the exponent towards 0.2
as the Reynolds number increases. The helium data,
on the other hand, show the exceptional behavior of a
Reynolds-number-independent “constant” of around 0.1.
Some comments on this behavior are made.

It is useful to summarize the standard analysis in order
to emphasize the quality of the data. As is the standard
practice, energy dissipation is constructed via its one-

the integral length L, the record length Lrecord, the res-

of the Kolmogorov dissipation scale η = (ν3/hεi)1/4 are
listed in Table I. To calculate the numerical value of λ
the method described in [10] has been used. The inte-
gral length is deﬁned as the integral over the velocity
autocorrelation function (using Taylor’s hypothesis). In
the atmosphere, where the data do not converge for very
large values of the time lag, the autocorrelation function
is smoothly extrapolated to zero and the integral is evalu-
ated. This smoothing operation towards the tail does not
introduce measurable uncertainty in L. The energy spec-
trum, which is illustrated in Fig. 1 for the records a2, w1
and h7 as representatives of the three diﬀerent ﬂow ge-
ometries with Reynolds numbers ranging from the small
to the very large side, follows an approximate −5/3-rds
power over the inertial range. The wind tunnel records
are relatively noise-free, while the helium data are af-
fected by instrumental noise signiﬁcantly, as evidenced by
the ﬂattening of the energy spectrum for high wave num-
bers. The atmospheric data fall somewhere in-between.
The eﬀect of this high-frequency noise, and of removing
it by a suitable ﬁltering scheme, will be discussed later.
Again for the three representative cases a2, w1 and h7,
Fig. 2 shows the two-point correlation deﬁned in (1) for
the surrogate quantity (2) and compares it to the best-ﬁts
for the proposed form of ﬁnite-size parametrization given
by Eq. (1). As is also the case for all the other records,
the agreement is quite substantial and unambiguous. The
upturn at small separation distances d < Λ∗ has been
explained in [5] as the eﬀect of the surrogacy of the en-
ergy dissipation. Hence, we call Λ∗ the surrogacy cutoﬀ
length. The two-point function decorrelates at a length
scale Lcasc that is substantially larger than the integral
length scale. The cascade length Lcasc and the surro-
gacy cutoﬀ length Λ∗ are also listed in Table I for all the
records inspected.

INTERMITTENCY EXPONENT

To determine the intermittency exponent µ, the data
are ﬁtted to Eq. (1) using a best-ﬁt algorithm (see Fig. 2).
These values are also listed in Table I. The local slopes
from the best ﬁts, plotted as insets in the ﬁgure, show
that deviations from the pure power-law become evident
only towards large values of the separation distance d.

FIG. 2: Best ﬁts of expression (1) to two-point correlators
extracted from data sets a2, w1, unﬁltered h7 and ﬁltered h7
(h7f). The inset ﬁgures show the local slopes, compared with
the ﬁts given by (1). For comparison, power-law ﬁts with
the extracted intermittency exponent listed in Table I (and
µ = 0.13 for h7f) are shown as dashed straight lines drawn
with arbitrary shifts.

The dashed lines in each ﬁgure are pure power-laws (with
arbitrary shift) for the values of µ listed in the Table.

For the atmospheric boundary layer, the analysis of
two data sets yields a value of about 0.2 for the intermit-
tency exponent µ; see Fig. 3. Note that, since the data set
a1 contains both the longitudinal and transverse velocity
components, one can form diﬀerent forms of the surro-
gate energy dissipation. It was found in Ref. [5] that all
of them lead to the same value of the intermittency expo-
nent. The ﬁltering of the data has no measurable eﬀect
on the numerical value of µ.

The wind-tunnel data w1-w8 seem to suggest a
Reynolds number dependence of the intermittency ex-
ponent for Rλ of up to about 1000. The value µ = 0.2
of the atmospheric boundary layer is reached only for
higher Rλ. Unfortunately there is no laboratory data
for Rλ > 1000 so that there is a gap between the wind
tunnel data and the atmospheric boundary layer data.
Nevertheless, all the air data taken together appear to
be consistent with a trend that increases with the Taylor
microscale Reynolds number up to an Rλ of about 1000,
and saturates thereafter. This trend is also supported by
results quoted in the literature [3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
although the ﬁnite-size form (1) has not been employed
for the extraction of the intermittency exponent. The
literature values, shown in Fig. 3, ﬁll the gap between

the present wind tunnel and atmospheric data.

In contrast to the air data, the gaseous helium records

that, unlike the air data which show a gradual trend with
Rλ, leading to a saturation for Rλ > 1000, the helium
data yield an intermittency exponent that is ﬂat with
Rλ at a lower value of 0.1. It remains an open question
as to why this is so.
It would be important to settle
this puzzle and clarify if this special behavior has other
consequences for the helium jet data.

To make some progress, we examined the helium data
more closely. Perhaps the instrumental noise, which is
seen in Fig. 1c by the ﬂattening of the energy spectrum
for high frequencies, aﬀects the accuracy of the calcula-
tion of the energy dissipation. To account for such ef-
fects, we applied a Wiener ﬁlter to the data, see again
Fig. 1c, and recomputed the two-point correlation; the
result is shown in Fig. 2d. The quality of the agreement
with the ﬁnite-size parametrization remained the same
but the numerical value for the intermittency exponent
altered. Filtering produces diﬀerent amounts of shift for
diﬀerent sets of data; see again Fig. 3. The most extreme
change of the numerical value was found for h7, where the
intermittency exponent changed from µ = 0.09 in the un-
ﬁltered case to µ = 0.13 in the ﬁltered case. The diﬀer-
ence between the two values can perhaps be taken as the
bounds for the error in the determination of the inter-
mittency exponent. Given this uncertainty, one cannot
attribute any trend with respect to the Reynolds num-
ber for the helium data, and an average constant value of
µ ≈ 0.1 seems to be a good estimate for all helium data.
Further questions relate to the spatial and temporal

4

resolutions of the hot wire. The temporal resolution in
the helium case is comparable to that in the air data (see
Table I); and, if anything, the ratio of the wire length to
the smallest ﬂow scale, namely lw/η, is better for helium
experiments. However, an important diﬀerence between
the air data and the helium data concerns the length to
the diameter of the hot wire. For air measurements, the
ratio is usually of the order of a hundred (about 140 for
a1 and a2 and about 200 for w1 to w7), while it is about
1/3 for h1-h11. In general, this is some cause for concern
because the conduction losses from the sensitive element
to the sides will be governed partly by this ratio, but the
precise eﬀect depends on the conductivity of the mate-
rial with which the hot wires are made. For hot wires
used in air measurements, the material is a platinum-
rhodium alloy, while for those used in helium, the wire is
made of Au-Ge sputtered on a ﬁber glass. This issue has
been discussed at some length for similarly constructed
hot wires of Emsellem et al. [16]. The conclusion there
has not been deﬁnitive, but the helium data discussed in
[16] show another unusual behavior: unlike the air data
collected in [17], the ﬂatness of the velocity derivative
shows a non-monotonic behavior with Rλ. See also ﬁg-
ure 4 of Ref. [18]. Whether the two unusual behaviors
of the helium data are related, and whether they are in
fact due to end losses, remains unclear and cannot be
conﬁrmed without further study. A further comment is
oﬀered towards the end of the paper.

The data on the surrogacy cutoﬀ length Λ∗ does not
show a clear Reynolds number dependence. Referring
again to Table I, it appears that Λ∗ is directly related to
neither λ nor η. However, deﬁnitive statements cannot
be made because of the practical diﬃculty of locating Λ∗
precisely.

Figure 4 illustrates the ﬁndings on the cascade length
ratio Lcasc/η. The ratio increases with the large-scale
Reynolds number R = u′Lcasc/ν as a power-law with
the exponent of 3/4, exactly as anticipated if Lcasc were
proportional to the integral scale. The ratio Lcasc/L is
not exactly a constant for all the data (as can be seen
from Table 1), but given the uncertainty in determining
L and the absence of any systematic trend suggests that
our supposition is reasonable. This is further reinforced
by the variation of Lcasc/η with respect to Rλ (see inset),
which also follows the expected behavior. We should note
that it is diﬃcult to single out the helium data in this
respect.

There is more to learn from ﬁtting the ﬁnite-size
parametrization (1) to the experimental two-point cor-
relations than merely extracting the intermittency expo-
nent and the cascade length. As revealed by a closer
inspection of the asymptotic behavior as d → Lcasc, see
again Fig. 2, the two-point correlation of the atmospheric
boundary layer and wind tunnel records approach their
asymptotic value of unity from above, whereas for most
of the gaseous helium jet records the curve ﬁrst swings
a little below unity before approaching the asymptotic
value. The expression (1) is ﬂexible enough to reproduce

The a-, w- and h-records are represented by diamonds, circles

Reynolds number is deﬁned as R = u′Lcasc/ν. The inset

which has been presented in Ref. [6], also speciﬁes the

in terms of cascade quantities. Normalized to hΠi = 1, Π
represents the initial energy ﬂux density, which is fed into
the cascade at the initial length scale Lcasc. hq2
L/Ri and
hqLqRi are second-order moments of the bivariate prob-
abilistic cascade generator p(qL, qR) = p(qR, qL), which
we assume to be symmetric. Again the normalization of
the left and right random multiplicative weights is such
that hqL/Ri = 1. Note, that log2hq2
L/Ri = µ is equal
to the intermittency exponent. Figure 5 shows various
graphs of the two-point correlation (1) with the expres-
sion (3), where parameters µ and Lcasc have been kept
ﬁxed, but c has been varied in the range 0 < c < 1.
We observe that for large c the two-point correlation ap-
proaches its asymptotic value from above, whereas for
small c it swings below one before it reaches the asymp-
totic value from below. The transition between these
two behaviors occurs at c ≈ 1
1+µ . This translates to
hΠ2ihqLqRi = (21+µ−1)/(1+µ), which is 1.08 for µ = 0.2
and 1.04 for µ = 0.1. Hence, we are tempted to conclude
that for the air data the ﬂuctuation of the initial energy

jet data; this appears to be plausible and is one diﬀer-
ence between air and helium data. We also read this as
an indication that hqLqRi < 1, which is fulﬁlled if the
left and right multiplicative weight are anticorrelated to
some extent. As has already been discussed in a diﬀerent
context [19], this anticorrelation is a clear signature that
the three-dimensional turbulent energy cascade conserves
energy.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In summary, we state that the picture of the turbu-
lent energy cascade is robust and again conﬁrmed by
the excellent agreement between the two-point corre-
lation density predicted by random multiplicative cas-
cade theory and that extracted from various experimen-
tal records. The cascade mechanism appears to be uni-
versal, although its strength, as represented by the in-
termittency exponent, seems to depend on the Reynolds
number except when it is very high. The discrepancy
between the air data on the one hand and the gaseous
helium data on the other remains a puzzle (despite some
possible explanations oﬀered), and is in need of a fuller
explanation.

Abstract

We present Lagrangian one-particle statistics from the Risø PTV experiment of a turbulent ﬂow.

We estimate the Lagrangian Kolmogorov constant C0 and ﬁnd that it is aﬀected by the large scale

inhomogeneities of the ﬂow. The pdf of temporal velocity increments are highly non-Gaussian for

small times which we interpret as a consequence of intermittency. Using Extended Self-Similarity we

manage to quantify the intermittency and ﬁnd that the deviations from Kolmogorov 1941 similarity

scaling is larger in the Lagrangian framework than in the Eulerian. Through the multifractal model

we calculate the multifractal dimension spectrum.

INTRODUCTION

In the present contribution we present experimental results on Lagrangian one-particle

statistics from an experiment with the Risø Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) setup. We

focus on small-scale statistics in a turbulent ﬂow: the statistic is analyzed with Extended

Self-Similarity (ESS) [2] and the results are presented in the spirit of the multifractal model

of turbulence [11]. The use of ESS is discussed together with the multifractal model in a

ﬁnite Reynolds number ﬂow like the present.

We have performed a Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) experiment in an intermediate

Reynolds number turbulent ﬂow. The ﬂow has earlier been reported in [3, 4, 14] although we

use data from a recording with a slightly lower Reynolds number. PTV is an experimental

method suitable for obtaining Lagrangian statistics in turbulent ﬂows [9, 13, 19, 20, 24, 33]:

Lagrangian trajectories of ﬂuid particles in water are obtained by tracking neutrally buoyant

particles in space and time. The ﬂow is generated by eight rotating propellers, which change

their rotational direction in ﬁxed intervals in order to suppress a mean ﬂow, placed in the
50cm3 (see Fig 1). The data acquisition system

size

400µm and density very close to one. We follow

(1000) particles at each time step

O

with a position accuracy of 0.05 pixels corresponding to less than 10µm.

The Stokes number, τI/τη (τI denotes the inertial relaxation time for the particle to the

ﬂow while τη is the Kolmogorov time) is much less than one and the particles can therefore

be treated as passive tracers in the ﬂow. The particles are illuminated by a 250W ﬂash

∼

lamp.

The mathematical algorithms for translating two dimensional image coordinates from the

four camera chips into a full set of three dimensional trajectories in time involve several cru-

cial steps: ﬁtting gaussian proﬁles to the 2d images, stereo matching (line of sight crossings)

with a two media (water-air) optical model and construction of 3d trajectories in time by

using the kinematic principle of minimum change in acceleration [21, 32].

The ﬂow characteristics are presented in Table I. The mean ﬂow is axisymmetric with

a signiﬁcant vertical straining on the largest scales and we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant

diﬀerences from the ﬂow reported in [3, 14], where properties of the mean ﬂow can be found.

Here we look at a sub-volume of the full measuring volume. Only particles which we

can observe within a ball of radius 50mm is considered and the turbulence characteristics

given in Table I are thus only determined from particles inside this ball. The ball is centered

approximately in the center of the tank where the velocity standard deviation σu has a global

minimum. Inside the ball the particles are uniformly distributed. With τη = 0.09s and a

recording frequency at 50Hz the temporal resolution is

4frames/τη.

Throughout the paper we will denote the Lagrangian velocity along a particle trajectory

for v(t) and the Eulerian velocity in a ﬁxed frame of reference for u(x, t).

II. FINITE VOLUME MEASUREMENTS

A nice property of the Eulerian velocity statistic is that it is stationary in time in the

present experiment. This is not the case for the Lagrangian statistics. The non-stationarity

measuring volume and the non-uniform forcing in space in our experiment: the particles only

gain kinetic energy close to the propellers. During their subsequent motion the particles loose

kinetic energy until they again come close to the propellers which are constantly spinning.

Looking at a ﬁnite measuring volume away from the propellers, there will therefore be a ﬂux

of kinetic energy into the volume. Inside the volume the kinetic energy is dissipated and

where we recognize the mean kinetic energy dissipation ε. From Figure 2 we ﬁnd ε =
124mm2/s2. This number is close to the number obtained from the second order Eulerian
Structure Function ε = 132mm2/s2. We take the diﬀerence as the uncertainty in estimating

ε. Eqn. 1 can also be derived directly from the Navier-Stokes equation by assuming global

homogeneity.

A common interpretation of the ﬁnite volume inﬂuence on Lagrangian statistics is that

the particles we can observe for long times are relatively slow ones or particles which are

trapped in high intensity vortices (see later). Here we emphasize the equivalence with the

energy argument of decaying turbulence described above. Particles which can be observed

for long times are slow because it is long time ago they gained kinetic energy at the forcing

site.

In Direct numerical simulations (DNS) forcing occurs in wave-number space on the lowest

wave-numbers. We therefore have d

/dt = 0 and consequently Lagrangian stationarity.

Most physical ﬂows encountered in nature will, however, be Lagrangian non-stationary.

III. ANISOTROPY AND INERTIAL RANGE SCALING

The linear dependence of Reλ on TL/τη implies that a very high Reynolds number is

needed in order to obtain a clear Lagrangian inertial range. Yeung [35] concluded, based
on extrapolations from Eulerian ﬁelds in DNS, that at least Reλ ∼
Experimental ﬂows at Reλ = 1000 [18] and Reλ = 815 [22] do, however, not show a very

(5)

where the Lagrangian Kolmogorov constant C0 is supposed to be universal for inﬁnite

Reynolds numbers [25]. C0 plays a crucial role in stochastic models [26] and has lately

been shown to reﬂect anisotropy in the large-scale forcing [22]. In Figure 4 we present re-

sults of C0 for the three coordinates of v(t). According to eqn. 5, C0 should be determined

from a plateau in the inertial range. The parabolic form therefore reﬂects the almost vanish-

ing inertial range in our experiments. The diﬀerence between radial and the axisymmetric

component stems from the large scale anisotropy. Since C0 is maximum for times around

2

4τ and therefore mainly associated with small scales the diﬀerence is a clear signature

of small-scale anisotropy. The values of C0 are 5.34

the three components x, y and z respectively.

It is interesting to see that the slight diﬀerence in the radial forcing is surviving all the way

down. The propellers forcing the ﬂow are attached to four rods placed in the corners of the

tank. The reason for the radial components being diﬀerent is probably small diﬀerences in

the manual vertical placement of the propellers on the rods. The lack of small-scale isotropy

in the current experiment should not be taken as a failure of Kolmogorov’s hypothesis of

local isotropy. For that the Reynolds number is not high enough. Other experiments at

much higher Reynolds number do, however, all indicate that the large scale inhomogeneities

are also present at smaller scales although with smaller amplitude [22, 28, 29].

Alternatively one can calculate the lagrangian velocity spectrum Φ(ω) and calculate C0

from this. Φ(ω) is deﬁned as the fourier transform of the velocity co-variance function

RL(τ ) [31]:

uncorrelated velocities for long time lags on a track. For higher frequencies all three spectra

turn red with slope of

higher than ω = 23.8s−1.

Lien and D’Asaro [12] studied the scaling properties in a simple Lorentzian model spec-

trum and found that with a ﬁnite Reynolds number it is easier to obtain inertial range scaling
from the spectrum than from the structure function S2
L(τ ). We have plotted the spectrum
compensated with ω2 in Figure 6 in order to have a better look at the existence of an iner-

tial range. For all three components a narrow inertial range is observed as a plateau. The

IV. SMALL-SCALE INTERMITTENCY

From the study of the lower moments we proceed to higher order moments describing the

most extreme events.

The pdfs of temporal velocity increments δv(τ ) = v(t + τ )

v(t) are shown in Figure 7

−

for diﬀerent time lags τ . All three components are shown. The three components show the

same over all behavior:

for large time lags the distributions are Gaussian while they for

small time lags have fat tails. The curves corresponding to the smallest time lags have a ﬂat

plateau at δv

0. This is a binning artifact and does therefore not represent any physical

∼

trend in the data. The non-Gaussianity for small times becomes more clear by looking at

the ﬂatness. The ﬂatness of the distributions is deﬁned as

The results presented in Figure 7 and 8 are strong evidence of Lagrangian intermittency,

i.e. non-Gaussian behavior of the smallest temporal scales in the ﬂow. These results agree

with observations by Mordant et al. [19] and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) by Biferale

et al. [6].

Our ﬁndings suggest that intermittency can be studied in ﬂows with a moderate Reynolds

number of order

(100). The only necessary condition seems to be the size of the ensemble:

a large number of particles is needed to observe rare events.

A. Higher order structure functions and ESS

Before we look at the higher order moments we check for convergence of these. In Figure 9

we show δvn(τ )p(δv(τ )) for n = 4, 6, 8, 10. The time lag in all four plot is τ = 2.1τη. For

n < 8 we observe convergence. For n = 8 we start to get into trouble, but it seems like we

have captured most of the signal – at least for the radial components (red and green curves).

In an incompressible ﬂow

therefore an artifact of sampling errors and / or tracking of particles. This is an issue which

has to be resolved before more dramatic conclusions can be made.

importantly, we know that the small scales are aﬀected by the large-scale inhomogeneities.

A popular way of looking at scaling exponent is instead to measure ratios of scaling

exponents. This method is called Extended self-similarity (ESS) and was introduced by

Benzi et al. [2]. The method was introduced in the Eulerian frame but can be transferred to

the Lagrangian frame if we assume that ζ L

2 = 1 following K41 similarity theory. The crucial

step is to treat all velocity increments as positive. This aﬀects the odd-numbered structure

functions. We therefore deﬁne

deduced from the Navier-Stokes equation. By plotting absolute (deﬁned by positive velocity

increments) structure functions vs. the third order structure function (Eulerian frame) or

the second order structure function (Lagrangian frame), an extended scaling range can be

observed because undulations in the structure functions are correlated and hence disappear

when plotted against each other. ESS is widely used and gives seemingly universal scaling

exponents for ﬂows in a wide range of Reynolds numbers. As pointed out by Arneodo et al. [1]

no consensus besides the observed facts exists about the interpretation or even signiﬁcance

of ESS. Whether the observed scaling in ESS is the signature of hidden physical laws is

speculated. In the Lagrangian frame an additional problem arise. As already mentioned

K41 predicts linear dependence of time scale for the Lagrangian second order structure

function and hence ζ L

2 = 1. This is motivated by the scaling in the Eulerian frame and

speciﬁcally from the four-ﬁfth law. A similar exact result does not exist for the Lagrangian

structure functions. So all in all, one could state that it is a wonder that it works!

The values in Table II are in excellent agreement with results obtained by Xu et al. [34]

and Mordant et al. [18]. The values by Biferale et al. [5] are somehow higher and was by

Xu et al. [33] explained as a diﬀerent choice of inertial range.

B. The multifractal framework

The multifractal model of turbulence was introduced by Parisi and Frisch [23] in the

Eulerian frame after an early attempt by Mandelbrot [15] who used multifractal measures

to characterize the spatial structure of dissipation in turbulence.

The multifractal model is phenomenological and has been able to successfully predict the

corrections to K41 similarity scaling for high order moments of spatial velocity increments

[11, 16, 30].

Borgas [8] discusses multifractals in the Lagrangian frame and introduces a bridge to

the Eulerian framework. The literature is, however, not very rich on work on Lagrangian

multifractals, which could have to do with the diﬃculties in obtaining reliable Lagrangian

data set more than a animosity against the multifractal model. Work by Biferale et al.

[5, 7], Chevillard et al. [10], Mordant et al. [17, 18], Xu et al. [34] have, however, shed light

on the issue of multifractals in the Lagrangian frame.

In the Lagrangian multifractal model the ﬂow is assumed to possess a range of scaling

exponents hmin, ..., hmax with a certain probability so that

For each scaling exponent h there is a fractal set with a h-dependent dimension DL(h). The

embedding dimension is one (τ

In Figure 12 we have plotted DL(h) obtained through eqn. 14. First we calculated ζ L

The black dots are the result by Xu et al. [33] who in a PTV experiment of Reynolds

to measure directly and through eqn. 14 as we have done here. They arrived at the same

DL(h) from both calculations putting conﬁdence in the multifractal model for Lagrangian

velocity increments. The agreement between their data and ours is very good. Only for

h > 0.6 in the linear portion of DL(h) do we observe a discrepancy.

This linear portion of DL(h) was by Xu et al. [33] explained in the following way: because
the domain of h is ﬁnite eqn. 13 will become a linear function after some p′. This linear
behavior is also observed in Figure 11 for large ps. The transition point h′ happens where p′
minimizes the right hand side of eqn. 13. For p > p′ we therefore have that ζ L

12 therefore stems from diﬀerent estimates of ζ L

Chevillard et al. [10] came up with a formula for the connection between DL(h) and its

Eulerian counterpart DE(h). The formula is

More interesting is the departure from the K41 prediction which is smaller than in the

Lagrangian frame. This is interpret as Lagrangian statistics being more intermittent.

From eqn. 17 and 15 we can ﬁnd DL(h) from the Eulerian anomalous scaling exponent

presented in Figure 13 (b). The comparison is plotted in Figure 14. Again we observe

17

a discrepancy in the linear part of DL

h . Whether it comes from the determination of the
anomalous scaling exponents from ESS or that there is a ﬂaw in eqn. 15 we can not say at the

moment. A direct measurement of the probability Ph in both the Eulerian and Lagrangian

frame might give more insight into the connection between the two frames.

The physical interpretation of the multifractal model is not that easy. In K41 similarity

scaling only one scaling exponent is possible, namely h = 1/3 and thus ζ E

p = p/3. This is

motivated from the fact the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation is only invariant under one scaling
group. This group is characterized by an exponent ¯h obtained by scaling the N-S with the

following transformation (time,position,velocity): t, r, u
solution is ¯h =

equation becomes negligible and we ﬁnd that the N-S equation. is now invariant to inﬁnitely
many exponents ¯h. This is one of the motivations for the multifractal model. It is, however,

not a justiﬁcation. Another important aspect of the model is the fact that when an eddy

breaks up into smaller eddies in the Richardson picture the smaller eddies do not cover the

same amount of space. Instead they cover only a fraction equal to 3

DE(h). We thus

−

have regions in the ﬂow with large activity and regions with almost calm waters. In the

18

Lagrangian frame this would mean that the individual ﬂuid particles are not free to move

around in all directions. For example as reported by [24] and [7] are particles often trapped

by intense vortices. The large accelerations and velocity increments of these events are

therefore of dimension lower than 3 in the Eulerian frame and lower than 1 in the temporal.

This spiral motion of ﬂuid particle around a ﬂuid ﬁlament is also the ﬂuid mechanical picture

of intermittent events in the model by She and Leveque [27]: by entraining surrounding ﬂuid

kinetic energy ﬂuctuations are eﬀectively dissipated along the axis of the ﬁlament.

As emphasized by Borgas [8] the multifractal model does, however, not imply that the

trajectories of ﬂuid particles are fractal trajectories themselves.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have measured Lagrangian one-particle statistics and looked at small-scale behavior.

The ﬁniteness of the measuring volume can be used to calculate the mean kinetic energy

dissipation ε in the ﬂow without any further assumptions. The small scales do seem to

be aﬀected by the large-scale inhomogeneities present in our ﬂow. We do not observe a

signiﬁcant inertial range but by Extended Self-Similarity we are able to extract a quantitative

measure of the structure functions of high order. From these we calculate the Lagrangian

anomalous scaling exponents and ﬁnd excellent agreement with already published results.

Via the multifractal model we have calculated the Lagrangian multifractal dimension

spectrum. The spectrum is similar to the one published by Xu et al. [34] even though our

Reynolds number is signiﬁcantly lower and our mean ﬂow is diﬀerent.

Most importantly we have shown that a high Reynolds number is not necessary to obtain

results in the Lagrangian frame. All experiments and DNS do show the same qualitative

features and no clear Lagrangian inertial range has been observed. Whether it is because

current experiments are performed with too low Reynolds number or it simply do not exist

future experiments will tell.

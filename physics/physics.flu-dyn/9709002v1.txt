Abstract

This work is devoted to the decay of random solutions of the unforced
Burgers equation in one dimension in the limit of vanishing viscosity.
The initial velocity is homogeneous and Gaussian with a spectrum
proportional to kn at small wavenumbers k and falling oﬀ quickly at
large wavenumbers.

In physical space, at suﬃciently large distances, there is an “outer
region”, where the velocity correlation function preserves exactly its
initial form (a power law) when n is not an even integer.

When 1 < n < 2 the spectrum, at long times, has three scaling re-
gions : ﬁrst, a |k|n region at very small ks with a time-independent con-
stant, stemming from this outer region, in which the initial conditions
are essentially frozen; second, a k2 region at intermediate wavenum-
bers, related to a self-similarly evolving “inner region” in physical
space and, ﬁnally, the usual k−2 region, associated to the shocks. The
switching from the |k|n to the k2 region occurs around a wavenumber
ks(t) ∝ t−1/[2(2−n)], while the switching from k2 to k−2 occurs around
kL(t) ∝ t−1/2 (ignoring logarithmic corrections in both instances).

When −1 < n < 1 there is no inner region and the long-time

evolution of the spectrum is self-similar.

When n = 2, 4, 6, . . . the outer region disappears altogether and the
long-time evolution is again self-similar. For other values of n > 2,
the outer region gives only subdominant contributions to the small-k
spectrum and the leading-order long-time evolution is also self-similar.
The key element in the derivation of the results is an extension of
the Kida (1979) log-corrected 1/t law for the energy decay when n = 2
to the case of arbitrary integer or non-integer n > 1. A systematic
derivation is given in which both the leading term and estimates of
higher order corrections can be obtained. It makes use of the Balian–
Schaeﬀer (1989) formula for the distribution in space of correlated
particles, which gives the probability of having a given domain free of
particles in terms of a cumulant expansion. The particles are, here, the
intersections of the initial velocity potential with suitable parabolas.
The leading term is the Poisson approximation used in previous work,
which ignores correlations.

High-resolution numerical simulations are presented which support

our ﬁndings.

1 Introduction

The Burgers equation

∂tv + v∂xv = ν∂2

xv,

(1)

describes a variety of nonlinear wave phenomena arising in the theory of
wave propagation, acoustics, plasma physics and so on (see, e.g., Whitham
1974; Gurbatov, Malakhov & Saichev 1991). It was originally introduced by
Jan M. Burgers (1939) as a toy model for turbulence. On the one hand, it
shares a number of properties with the Navier–Stokes equation : the same
type of nonlinearity, of invariance groups and of energy-dissipation relation,
the existence of a multidimensional version, etc. On the other hand, it is
known to be integrable (Hopf 1950; Cole 1951) and therefore lacks the prop-
erty of sensitive dependence on the initial conditions (chaos). When this was
realized, interest in the Burgers equation as a toy model for Navier–Stokes
turbulence abated somewhat. More recently, it became clear that a number
of questions connected to the Burgers equation are far from trivial. One class
of problems, arising e.g. in surface growth (Barab´asi & Stanley 1995), leads
to a Burgers equation with a random driving force (usually white-noise in
time) added to the right hand side (Kardar, Parisi & Zhang 1986; Bouchaud,
M´ezard & Parisi 1995; Cheklov & Yakhot 1995; Polyakov 1995; Gurarie
& Migdal 1996; E et al. 1997). Even in the absence of a driving force,
the explicit solution provided by the Hopf–Cole method leads to non-trivial
problems in the limit of vanishing viscosity, when random initial conditions
are assumed. An example, motivated by work on large-scale structures in
the Universe (Zeldovich 1970; Gurbatov & Saichev 1984; Gurbatov, Saichev
& Shandarin 1989; Shandarin & Zeldovich 1989), is when the initial velocity
ﬁeld is a Brownian (or fractional Brownian) process in the space variable
(She, Aurell & Frisch 1992; Sinai 1992; Vergassola et al. 1994; Aurell et al.
1997). Other examples arise in the sudy of disordered systems (Bouchaud &
M´ezard 1997).

Another instance, which is at the core of the present study, is the long-
time behavior of freely decaying solutions in the limit of zero viscosity and,
in particular the law of decay of the energy. Before reviewing this issue it
is useful to put it into a broader perspective, namely the law of decay for
three-dimensional Navier–Stokes turbulence.

K´arm´an & Howarth (1938; see also Lin & Reid 1963), investigating the

3

decay of high-Reynolds number, homogeneous isotropic three-dimensional
turbulence, proposed a self-preservation (self-similarity) ansatz for the spa-
tial correlation function of the velocity : the correlation function keeps a ﬁxed
functional shape; the integral scale L(t) and the root-mean-square velocity
u(t) have a long-time power-law behavior; there are two exponents which can
be related by the condition that the energy dissipation per unit mass should
be proportional to u3/L. But an additional relation is needed to actually de-
termine the exponents. Kolmogorov (1941) realized this and proposed using
the so-called “Loitsyansky (1939) invariant” as the additional relation and,
thereby, derived a law of energy decay u2(t) ∝ t−10/7. Proudman & Reid
(1954) and Batchelor & Proudman (1956) showed that the integral consid-
ered by Loitsyansky is actually not invariant. Under the assumption that
the energy spectrum E(k, t) ∝ k4 at small wavenumbers k, the Loitsyansky
integral is, within a numerical factor, just the coeﬃcient of k4. For isotropic
turbulence, the contribution of the nonlinear term to the time derivative of
the energy spectrum, which is called the transfer function, should be propor-
tional to k4 at small k, thereby preventing the constancy of the Loitsyansky
integral. However, if initially E(k) ∝ |k|n with a “spectral exponent” n < 4,
then the coeﬃcient of |k|n will be invariant. This is called here the princi-
ple of “permanence of large eddies” (PLE). Kolmogorov’s argument is easily
adapted to that case and gives then u2(t) ∝ t−2(n+1)/(n+3) (see, e.g., Frisch
1995, Section 7.7).

Almost exactly the same arguments may be applied to the one-dimensional
Burgers turbulence. In one dimension the transfer function should be pro-
portional to k2 at small k (see Section 3). Hence, if the initial energy spec-
trum E0(k) ∝ |k|n with −1 < n < 2, Kolmogorov’s argument predicts again
u2(t) ∝ t−2(n+1)/(n+3). We shall see that this is correct only when −1 < n < 1.
For Navier–Stokes turbulence, a rigorous derivation of the law of energy
decay seems ruled out at present.1 The situation is of course more favorable
for Burgers-type turbulence and it will be our main goal in this paper to
critically examine the issues of self-similarity and energy decay at long times.
In this paper we shall exclusively consider the behavior of the solutions in the
limit of vanishing viscosity for Gaussian initial data. For the eﬀect of a ﬁnite

1It is not even clear, in three dimensions, if for the initial value problem there is any
energy decay at all in the limit of vanishing viscosity, since the issue of breakdown of
smoothness for the Euler ﬂow is moot (see, e.g., Frisch 1995, Section 7.8).

(small) viscosity and/or non-Gaussian initial data (e.g., piecewise constant
or shot noise velocities), the reader is referred to recent papers by Funaki,
Surgailis & Woyczynski (1995), Surgailis (1996, 1997) and Hu & Woyczynski
(1996).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate our problem
and list some elementary results about the Burgers equation to be used in
what follows. Section 3 is devoted to phenomenological derivations of the
main results about the decay of random solutions to the Burgers equation,
the nature of which depends crucially on the spectral exponent n. The most
delicate results, obtained when n > 1, are rederived by systematic methods
in Sections 5 and 6.
In Section 4 we discuss previous work on this issue.
In Section 5 we derive the law of decay of energy as the leading term in
a systematic expansion. Our basic tool is the cumulant expansion (Balian
& Schaeﬀer, 1989) of the probability of ﬁnding regions in space without
particles.
In Section 6 we calculate the spatial correlation function, and
prove the permanence of large eddies. In Section 7 we summarize our main
ﬁndings and derive consequences, such as the absence of globally self-similar
decay for the energy spectrum when 1 < n < 2. Section 8 presents high-
resolution numerical experiments which conﬁrm such ﬁndings. Section 9
presents concluding remarks. The Appendix contains a rederivation of the
Balian–Schaeﬀer formula in a form appropriate for our problem.

2 Formulation and elementary results

We shall be concerned with the initial-value problem for the unforced Burgers
equation in one dimension :

∂tv + v∂xv = ν∂2

v0(x) ≡ v(x, 0).

As is well-known, the solution to the Burgers equation with positive viscosity
ν, has an explicit integral representation obtained by Hopf (1950) and Cole
(1951). We are mainly interested here in the solutions in the limit of vanish-
ing viscosity. Use of Laplace’s method then leads to the following “maximum
representation” for the potential (Hopf 1950) in the limit of vanishing vis-
cosity (henceforth always understood) :

where ψ0(a) is the initial potential. Expansion of the square shows that (6)
is basically a Legendre transformation. From (5) and (6) it follows that

ψ(x, t) = max

where a(x, t) is the coordinate at which Φ(x, a, t) achieves its (global) maxi-
mum for given x and t. It is easily checked that a is the Lagrangian coordinate
from which emanates the ﬂuid particle which will be at x at time t (see, e.g.,
Gurbatov et al. 1991).

In what follows we shall work with homogeneous random velocity ﬁelds.

We list the main deﬁnitions. The correlation function is

Bv(x, t) ≡ hv(x, t)v(0, t)i,

(9)

where the angular brackets denote ensemble averages. Its Fourier transform,
the energy spectrum is

The initial values of the correlation function and of the energy spectrum are

We now introduce the basic assumptions of this paper. The initial velocity

ﬁeld is homogeneous and Gaussian with an energy spectrum of the form

E0(k) = α2|k|nb0(k),

where n is the spectral exponent. The even and non-negative function b0(k)
is assumed to satisfy b0(0) = 1. It is smooth and decreases faster than any
inverse power of k at inﬁnity (this implies, of course, that the initial veloc-
ity correlation function is very smooth). b0(k) can be characterized by a
wavenumber k0 around which lies most of the initial energy and which is,
in order of magnitude, the inverse of the initial integral scale L0. The usual
deﬁnition of the integral scale, which involves the integral of the correla-
tion function, is not appropriate since this integral vanishes for any n > 0.
Instead, we use

L0 ≡

where σ2

This deﬁnition of L0 will be convenient in deriving various long-time laws in
Sections 5 and 6.

As we shall see, the value of the spectral exponent n determines the
universality class of the decaying solution at long times.
In order for the
velocity to be homogeneous its variance must be ﬁnite; hence, we must have
n > −1. When −3 < n < −1 the velocity has inﬁnite variance and only
increments are homogeneous; the velocity itself behaves, at large distances, as
a Brownian or fractional Brownian motion process, a case considered by She
et al. (1992), Sinai (1992), Vergassola et al. (1994), which is not within the
scope of the present paper. When −1 < n < 1 the velocity is homogeneous
whereas the potential behaves, at large distances, as a Brownian or fractional
Brownian motion process. This case has already been investigated by Burgers
(1974), by She et al.
(1992) and by Avellaneda & E (1995) and will be
considered here only brieﬂy. We shall concentrate on the case n > 1, when
both the velocity and the potential are homogeneous.

2.1 Elementary results

We observe that the smoothness of the energy spectrum at the origin depends
on the spectral exponent n. When n is an even integer, our assumption
implies that the initial correlation function B0v(x), being the nth derivative of
a smooth function of x decreasing rapidly at inﬁnity, also has these properties.
When n is odd or non-integer the spectrum is not smooth. It follows that
the correlation function decreases as a power law (Pitman 1968; Bleistein &
Handelsman 1975), viz 2

B0v(x) ≃ α2Cn|x|−n−1,

(16)

(17)

Next, we observe that, when n > 1, the initial potential ψ0(x) is a homoge-
neous random function while, for n < 1, it only has homogeneous increments.
In the former case, the potential has a translation-invariant correlation func-
tion, denoted by B0ψ(x), the Fourier transform of which is E0(k)/k2. In the
latter case, it is simpler to characterize the initial potential by its structure
function

S0ψ(x) ≡ h(ψ0(x) − ψ0(0))2i,
which is still translation-invariant and exists as long as n > −1. It is related
to the energy spectrum by

S0ψ(x) = 4α2

When n > 1 the structure function goes to a ﬁnite limit at large separations
while, when n < 1, it grows without bound :

|x| → ∞.

(20)

An important consequence of (4), (5) and (11), valid whenever the velocity
is homogeneous, irrespective of the potential being or not being homogeneous,
is

E(t) = hv2i = h(∂xψ)2i = 2∂thψ(x, t)i.

and ∝ when the quantities are just proportional.

It relates the energy to the time-derivative of the mean potential, which does
not dependent on the position x.

We now recall some results about the Burgers equations which are rela-

tively standard and will be used in what follows.

When n ≥ 0, the correlation invariant

J(t) =

hv(x, t)v(0, t)i dx = E(0, t)

(22)

is time independent.
Indeed, using the conservation form of the Burgers
equation (3), it is checked that the time derivative of the integral in (22),
limited from −X to +X is expressed in terms of correlations between quan-
tities evaluated at points a distance X apart. Such correlations vanish as
X → ∞ because, with our assumptions, the initial conditions have decreas-
ing correlations at large separation and this property will be preserved.3 Note
that J is just the value of the energy spectrum at k = 0.

A straightforward consequence of the Burgers equation with a homoge-

neous velocity ﬁeld is

∂tBv(x, t) =

∂xS3(x, t) + 2ν∂2

xBv(x, t),

(23)

1
6

which relates the correlation function Bv(x, t) and the third order structure
function S3(x) ≡ h[v(x, t) − v(x, 0)]3i. This equation is the analogue of the
K´arm´an–Howarth equation for Navier–Stokes turbulence. Just as the latter
implies Kolmogorov’s four-ﬁfths law (see, e.g., Frisch 1995), eq. (23) implies
a “twelve law” : in the limit of vanishing viscosity and at scales much smaller
than the integral scale, we have

S3(x) = −12εx,

(24)

where ε ≡ ∂thv2/2i is the mean energy dissipation.

Eq. (23) or (24), in the limit of zero viscosity, puts a strong constraint
on self-similar decaying solutions both for Navier–Stokes and Burgers tur-
bulence. By self-similar decaying solutions, we understand the following :
when the velocity v and the space coordinate x are rescaled by suitable

properties of the solution become independent of the time. This deﬁnition
implies in particular the following scalings for the correlation function and
the third-order structure function of the velocity :

with dimensionless time-independent functions ˜Bv and ˜S3. Substituting (25)-
(26) into (23) for ν → 0 and demanding that ˜Bv and ˜S3 be time independent,
we obtain two ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations relating u(t) and L(t), namely,

where the dot denotes time diﬀerentiation and α1 and α2 are two dimen-
sionless undetermined constants. Note that exactly the same equations are
obtained with a self-similarity ansatz for Navier–Stokes turbulence. Eq. (27)
has power-law solutions4 but, as already pointed out by Kolmogorov (1941),
the exponents in the power laws cannot be determined solely from the self-
similarity ansatz. Additional ingredients are needed.

For what follows it will be convenient to give a precise deﬁnition of the

scaling factors. We choose u(t) to be the r.m.s. velocity

and we deﬁne the “integral scale” L(t) by taking α2 = 1 in (27), that is

Let us ﬁnally note that in Fourier space the self-similarity ansatz (25),

together with (29), translates into

similarity conditions (25)-(26) and (27) only in an asymptotic sense, for long times and to
leading order. We shall then see that u(t) and L(t) may take the form of power laws with
logarithmic corrections.

3 Phenomenology of the decay

3.1 Permanence of large eddies and self-similar decay

An important role in the decay at long times is played by the principle of
permanence of large eddies (PLE). We shall give two formulations almost –
but not quite – equivalent, one in physical space and the other one in Fourier
space.
PLE : physical space formulation. We assume that the Gaussian ini-
tial velocity has a correlation function with a power-law behavior at large
distances :

Bv(x) ≃ α2Cn|x|−n−1,

|x| → ∞,

(32)

with an exponent n > −1. Then, (32) remains true at any later time, with
the same exponent n and the same constant α.
PLE : Fourier space formulation. We assume that the Gaussian initial
velocity has a spectrum with a power-law behavior at small wavenumbers :

E(k) ≃ α2|k|n,

|k| → 0,

(33)

with an exponent 2 > n > −1. Then, (33) remains true at any later time,
with the same exponent and constant.

In its physical-space formulation PLE can be supported by the following
argument. From (32), it follows that the characteristic velocity associated
with a large separation x is

so that the corresponding “turnover time”, the characteristic time for signif-
icant changes through nonlinearity, is

u0(x) ∼ α|x|− n+1

t0(x) ∼

(34)

(35)

which grows without bound at large separations. Hence, at any ﬁnite time,
eddies of suﬃciently large size should remain essentially as they were initially.
This simple argument could be upset if two ﬂuid particles, initially strongly
correlated (say, separated by not more than one initial integral scale), were to
propagate this correlation to a large separation x in a ﬁnite time.5 However,
with Gaussian initial conditions this occurrence has a very small probability,
which can be bounded by ∝ exp[−(1/2)x2/(σvt)2], as explained in the foot-
note following the derivation of the constancy of J (eq. (22)) in the previous
section. Thus, the initial correlation function at large separations should
remain unaﬀected to leading order.

In its Fourier space formulation, PLE has already been proven in the pre-
vious section, for the case of the spectral index n = 0. When n < 2, PLE is
a consequence of the observation that the time-rate of change of the energy
spectrum, the so-called transfer function, is typically proportional to k2 at
small wavenumbers, because of the beating interactions of pairs of Fourier
components with nearly opposite wavevectors. We may also derive the con-
stancy of the coeﬃcient of |k|n just from the constancy of the coeﬃcient of
|x|−n−1 at large x.

There are reasons why the two formulations are not quite equivalent.
First, the n = 0 result in Fourier space is not an instance of PLE in physical
space. Indeed, when n is an even integer, (32) implies a non-analytic spec-
trum at small k with logarithmic corrections. Second, when n > 2 and the
initial correlation function has the behavior (32) at large separations, the en-
ergy spectrum at any later time will begin with an analytic (time-dependent)
k2 term with a subleading non-analytic correction proportional to |k|n (with
a time-independent coeﬃcient).

We now show how PLE, used as a “boundary condition” at large x or
small k in connection with the self-similarity ansatz (25) and (29), allows us
to derive the law of temporal variation of the integral scale and the energy.
We ﬁrst give the argument in physical space. Let us assume that the distance
beyond which PLE applies is within the scope of the self-similarity formula
It then immediately follows from (25), (29) and (32) that ˜B(˜x) ∝
(25).

5For the case of incompressible Navier–Stokes turbulence, pressure eﬀects can instan-
taneously aﬀect the large-scale correlations and thereby invalidate PLE, at least in the
anisotropic case (Batchelor & Proudman 1956).

In Fourier space the self-similarity ansatz (30), together with (33) gives
˜E(˜k) ∝ |˜k|n, at small k and the same relations for integral scale and the
energy as written above. Clearly, this argument cannot be applied with
initial data such that the spectral index n ≥ 2, since the later spectrum has
now a k2 dependence at small k with a time-dependent coeﬃcient.

Actually, we shall now show that the laws (36) and (37) apply only when

n < 1.

We begin with the case −1 < n < 1 when the initial potential has homo-
geneous increments. Many aspects of this case are well understood, thanks
in particular to Burgers’ own work (1974; see also Gurbatov et al. 1991).
Increments ∆ψ0(L) of the initial po-

tential over a distance L = x − a can be estimated from the square root
of the structure function S0ψ(L) of the potential (18). For a given position
x, the maximum in (6)-(7) will come from those as such that the change in
potential is comparable to the change in the parabolic term

At large times L is also large and we can use (20) to obtain precisely (36)
and, hence, the energy law (37). Alternatively, we could argue that when t is
so large that the parabolas appearing in (7) have a radius of curvature much
larger than the typical radius of curvature of features in the initial potential,
we can plausibly replace that initial potential by fractional Brownian motion
of exponent h = (1 − n)/2 (in order to be consistent with (20)). Without loss
of generality we may assume that this fractional Brownian motion starts at
the origin for x = 0. This function is then statistically invariant under the
transformation x → λx and ψ0 → λhψ0. It is then elementary, using (6)-(7),
to prove that a rescaling of the time is (statistically) equivalent to a suitable
rescaling of x distances and of ψ(x, t). This implies (36) and (37).6

3.2 Elementary derivation of the Kida law of decay

The case n > 1 when the initial potential is homogeneous is more diﬃcult.
Because of this homogeneity, the structure function becomes constant at large
distances. If we then formally use (38) we obtain a t−1 law for the energy
and a t1/2 law for the integral scale. This is almost, but not quite, the right
result. There are logarithmic corrections, ﬁrst discovered by Kida (1979),
which can actually be captured by phenomenology, as now explained.

We shall estimate the energy in terms of the mean potential at x = 0,
using (21) and the maximum representation (6)-(7). We assume that, at
long times t, the distribution of values of the potential is peaked around
its (non-vanishing) mean value hψi ≡ hψ(0, t)i. This quantity is thus the
typical maximum value of ψ0(a) − a2/(2t). Equivalently, we ask : what is the
value hψi by which we should vertically shift the parabola a2/(2t) so that the
graph of ψ0(a) has a substantial probability of being everywhere below the
shifted parabola ? To estimate this probability we divide the a-axis into equal
intervals, I1, I2, I3, . . . , with a common length of about one initial integral
scale L0. The initial potential takes approximately independent values in the
diﬀerent intervals. Thus, the probability of no intersection with the shifted
parabola is (approximately) the product of the probabilities q1, q2, . . . of no
intersections in the various intervals :

Each of the qis is of the form 1 − pi, where pi is the probability of at least
one intersection in the interval Ii. This can be estimated as

Pno inters. ∼ q1q2 . . . .

pi ∼ W

hψi +

(39)

(40)

Here, W (ψ) is the single-point cumulative probability of ψ0, integrated from
ψ to inﬁnity and ai is any point in the interval Ii, since the parabolic function
changes very slowly with a when t is large. All the pis are small and thus

Pno inters. ∼ 1 − p1 − p2 . . . .

(41)

The sum of the pis can be approximated by an integral from −∞ to +∞.
When hψi is taken very large this integral is very small. As we decrease

Since we assumed Gaussian initial conditions with r.m.s. value σψ,the
cumulative probability W (ψ) is approximately exp [−(1/2)(ψ/σψ)2]. The
leading order of the integral in (42) is obtained by keeping only the ﬁrst two
terms in the expansion of the square of hψi + a2/(2t). Thereby, we obtain

We must, of course, stress that this derivation is only heuristic. We shall
come back to the issue of a more systematic derivation (Sections 5 and 6),
including estimates of the subleading corrections.

It is straightforward to extend this phenomenology to initial potentials
which are homogeneous and non-Gaussian, as the only ingredient used is
the p.d.f. of ψ0. For example, when the p.d.f. has a tail ∝ exp(−|ψ|β), the
logarithmic correction to the 1/t law has the exponent (1 − β)/β. Hence,
when n > 1 the law of decay could be very sensitive to the functional form
of the p.d.f. of the initial potential. Such heuristic considerations for non-
Gaussian potentials have not yet been tested by more systematic theory and
simulations.

3.3 The Kida law and the issue of self-similarity when

1 < n < 2

One of the most questionable aspects of our phenomenological derivation is
its validity when n is not an even integer. Indeed, this gives rise to long-
range algebraically decreasing correlations, which are neglected in this phe-
nomenology and which Kida (1979) explicitly ruled out. Actually, we shall
see in Section 5 that the Kida law remains valid nevertheless as long as the
initial potential is homogeneous, that is for any n > 1.

We now address for the ﬁrst time one of the central issues of this paper.
The predictions (36) and (37) for E(t) and L(t), obtained by assuming self-
similarity and using PLE as a “boundary condition” at large x (or small k) are
not consistent with the Kida law (45)-(46). Because of the time-dependence
of the coeﬃcient of k2 in the spectrum at small k, the applicability of the
former is obviously restricted to n < 2. Since the latter applies when n > 1,
there may be a contradiction in the region of overlap 1 < n < 2. Actually,
we shall see that n > 1 leads to a self-similar decay of the solution in an
“inner” region of not too large distances (or, in Fourier space, of not too small

16

wavenumbers), controlled by the integral scale L(t) (46). In this inner region
correlations of ψ decrease like a Gaussian function and the Fourier signature
is a range of wavenumbers at which the energy spectrum is ∝ k2. In addition,
if n > 1 and is not an even integer, there exists an “outer” frozen region at
which PLE applies. Thus, there is, at very large distances, an algebraic tail
in the correlation function and the spectrum has a time-independent |k|n
contribution at small k. When 1 < n < 2 this is the leading term at small
k so that the complete spectrum has three ranges : proportional to |k|n at
very small k, then proportional to k2 at intermediate wavenumbers (up to
approximately the inverse of the integral scale L(t)) and, ﬁnally, proportional
to k−2 at high k (the usual signature of shocks), as shown in Fig. 1. We shall
return to the issue of the global picture in Section 7.

4 Homogeneous initial potential : previous

work

In this section we discuss previous work dealing with the limit of vanishing
viscosity for initial potentials which are homogeneous and Gaussian. The
main papers under discussion are Kida (1979), Gurbatov & Saichev (1981;
see also Gurbatov et al. 1991), Fournier & Frisch (1983) and Molchanov,
Surgailis & Woyczynski (1995). For initial conditions such that the velocity
ﬁeld is homogeneous but the potential is not, or such that the initial condi-
tions are not Gaussian, the reader is referred to Burgers (1974), Albeverio,
Molchanov & Surgailis et al. (1994), and Esipov & Newman (1993), Esipov
(1994), Hu & Woyczynski (1996) and references therein.

Let us ﬁrst state the essence of what is at presently known to hold with
certainty. In the limit of vanishing viscosity, as the time t tends to inﬁnity,
the statistical solution becomes self-similar in the sense of Section 2. The
integral scale L(t) and the energy E(t) are given, to leading order, by

Note that the properties of the self-similar state are universal in so far as
they are expressed solely in terms of two integral characteristics of the initial
spectrum, namely the initial r.m.s. potential σψ and r.m.s. velocity σv.7 It
may be shown that the function P (˜x) is the probability of having no shock
within an Eulerian interval of length ˜xL(t) (Gurbatov, Malakhov & Saichev
1991).

Important consequences of (50)-(51) are the asymptotic behavior of the
non-dimensionalized correlation function ˜Bv(˜x) at large ˜x and of its Fourier
transform, the non-dimensionalized spectrum ˜E(˜k) (31) at small ˜k = kL(t)

Most of these results have already been obtained by Kida (1979). He was

and the initial correlations decrease rapidly at large separations, without
particularly emphasizing the Gaussian assumption. He introduced a model
of discrete independent maxima whose p.d.f. had three free parameters (an
exponent and two constants); their relation to the properties of the initial
conditions (say, the spectrum) were left unspeciﬁed. For the case of a p.d.f.
with a Gaussian tail, he obtained the functional form of the results given
above.

At long times, the contacts of the parabolas, in the maximum repre-
sentation (6)-(7) of the solution, are near large-value local maxima of the
initial potential. Kida’s assumption of independence of the successive max-
ima implicitly assumes a Poisson process. Gurbatov & Saichev (1981) who
conjectured the asymptotic existence of a Poisson process8 and Molchanov,
Surgailis & Woyczynski (1995) who proved it, showed that, in the x-ψ plane,
the density of the points is uniform in the x-direction and exponential in the
ψ-direction. This permits the calculation of the one- and two-point p.d.f.’s
of the velocity (Gurbatov & Saichev 1981). Molchanov, Surgailis & Woy-
czynski (1995) also calculated the full N-point multiple time distributions.
Their proof made crucial use of some ﬁne properties of extremes of Gaussian
processes (Leadbetter, Lindgren & Rootzen 1983).9 From the point of view
of the present paper it is important to stress that Molchanov, Surgailis &
Woyczynski’s (1995) result is valid for any n > 1 and not just for n ≥ 2. 10

Assuming a Poisson distribution, Gurbatov & Saichev (1981) and Fournier
& Frisch (1983) showed that the statistical properties of the points of con-
tact between the parabolas and the initial potential can be obtained from
the statistical properties of their intersections, whose mean number can be
calculated using the formula of Rice (1954; see also Leadbetter, Lindgren &
Rootzen 1983; Papoulis 1991). Thus, they could express the parameters in
the asymptotic formulas in terms of the r.m.s. initial potential and velocity.
None of the above theories give a control over how fast in time the asymp-
totic results are reached. Furthermore, the rescaling involved in these theories
can only capture what we have called in the previous section the “inner re-

8See also Fournier & Frisch (1983).
9What they proved is not exactly in the form of the long-time asymptotic relations given
above but an equivalent result in which the time and space variables and the amplitude
of the initial conditions are rescaled.

10They assume that the initial correlations of ψ decrease faster than the inverse of ln |x|

at large |x| and can be Taylor-expanded to fourth order at small |x|.

gion”, where PLE is irrelevant. We shall show in the next section that, for
ﬁnite long times, the Poisson distribution is just an approximation which can
be systematically reﬁned, so as to address such issues.

5 Systematic derivation of the Kida law for

the energy decay using the Balian–Schaeﬀer
formula

The (mean) energy is given by (21) in terms of the time derivative of the mean
potential hψi. Here, we use the method of Fournier & Frisch (1983) and the
Balian–Schaeﬀer formula (A.18), established in Appendix A, to derive the
asymptotic behavior of the mean potential for the case of a homogeneous
initial potential, that is, n > 1.

Let P (A, t) denote the probability density of ψ at time t and let Q(A, t)

denote the (cumulative) probability to have ψ < A, given by

The mean value of the potential at time t is then expressible as

Q(A, t) =

We shall see that the second integral in (58) may be bounded by a time-
independent constant, while the ﬁrst grows; so it is only the ﬁrst integral
that will be of importance in what follows.

The argument of the probability in (59) can be written as the condition

of non-intersection of the following two graphs, shown in Fig. 2 :

G1 : y 7→ ψ0(y),
y2
2t

G2 : y 7→ A +

.

(60)

We can immediately use this geometric picture to eliminate the second
integral in (58) from further discussion. Indeed, the probability that G1 and
G2 never intersect is obviously less than the probability that ψ0(y) is less
than A at the single point y equal to zero. The integral over A from minus
inﬁnity to zero of this quantity is ﬁnite and bounded by a quantity of the
order of σψ. This follows from the observation that, for negative A, the
probability Q(A, t) given by (59) is less than the same expression evaluated
at the single point y = 0. Hence, the contribution of the second integral in
(58) is bounded by a time-independent constant and will not contribute to
the logarithmically growing leading-order mean potential.

We now treat the intersections of the graphs G1 and G2 as “particles”
and apply the Balian–Schaeﬀer formula (A.18) of Appendix A to calculate
the probability of having zero particles (no intersections at all). We shall
limit ourselves to the case where G1 intersects G2 going upward (see the
footnote on p. 30 for what happens when all intersections are counted.).
Such intersections are depicted by circles in Fig. 2.

going downward, then the contribution is zero, because {Φ′

The integral in (62) therefore counts the number of upward intersections
(upcrossings) between the two graphs. Note that the assumed smoothness
of the process ψ0(y) (which follows from the fast decrease at inﬁnity of its
spectrum) renders the applicability of the Rice formula robust.

to a value of order unity happens around a value which we shall denote A∗(t).

5.1 The Poisson approximation

We are interested in the energy decay at large times and it will be shown
that in this case the ﬁrst cumulant c1 = f1 is the leading term in (61) and
that, to leading order, we have the Poisson approximation :

Q (A, t) ≃ exp {−c1} .

(69)

It is so called for the natural reason that if the upcrossings obeyed a Poisson
distribution, then (69) would be true exactly. The rest of this subsection
contains a computation of the ﬁrst cumulant c1.

The function F1 is determined by the single-point probability density of
the initial potential ψ and the velocity v, the subscript 0 being dropped for
conciseness. For a homogeneous random function, these two variables are
uncorrelated. We then obtain from (63) and (64)

In (72) we introduce the new dimensionless

It is seen that (73) involves two spatial scales : when z1 is small compared
to the “prefactor scale” t/tnl we can simply substitute Z(0) for Z(z1/(t/tnl));
when z1 is large compared to the “Gaussian scale” l(a, t) ≃
(t/tnl)/a there is
a large damping by the term in the exponent quadratic in z1. If we assume,
for the moment, that the typical value of a∗ = A∗/σψ where c1 becomes
t/tnl,11 it follows that it is
order unity does not grow in time faster than
self-consistent to assume that the prefactor scale is much larger than the
Gaussian scale, so that we may safely use Z(0) in (73).

The remaining integral in (73) cannot be carried out explicitly, but it
is nevertheless easy to evaluate it to relevant leading order. We have two
terms in the exponent that depend on z1 : one quadratic and one quartic.
The quartic term is larger for z1 much beyond the Gaussian scale, but then
the damping is strong anyway; so, the correction from the quartic term is
small, of relative order a−2 and thus negligible.
It is then easily shown
that, for those large values of a ∼ a∗ which give the dominant contribution
to the mean potential at large-time, we can use the following leading-order
approximation for the cumulant c1 :

We now determine a∗(t). For this, we assume that c1 is the dominant term in
the Balian–Schaeﬀer formula (61) for the probability of no intersections, as
will be shown in Section 5.2. a∗(t) is then determined by the condition that
c1(σψa∗, t) be order unity. To avoid undetermined constants, we deﬁne a∗(t)
by the condition c1(σψa∗, t) = 1, that is through the transcendental equation

We now return to the cumulative probability of Q(A, t). Using the Pois-

obtain the following doubly exponential distribution :12

where ζ is obtained from a by shifting and rescaling :

Since a∗(t) is logarithmically large at large times, it follows from (77)-(78)
that the values of a = A/σψ contributing to the mean potential (58) are
concentrated near a∗(t) with a small relative width ∆A
(a∗)2 ≃

5.2 Corrections to the Poisson approximation

So far we have only reproduced a known result. The Balian–Schaeﬀer formula
allows us to ﬁnd the applicability condition for the Poisson approximation
by estimating contributions of higher-order cumulants to (61).

12This doubly exponential distribution is equivalent to the distribution of maxima be-
ing Poisson with uniform density in space and exponentially decaying in a (Molchanov,
Surgailis & Woyczynski 1995).

26

We thus turn to the calculation of the second cumulant c2 appearing in
(61), given in terms of the one- and two-particle densities by (A.17), repeated
hereafter for convenience :

c2 =

[F2(y1, y2) − F1(y1)F1(y2)] dy1dy2.

(80)

Z Z

The function F2 is now given by (64). Our purpose in this section will only
be to show that the contribution of c2 – and of the higher-order cns – are
subdominant compared to that of c1. For this purpose, it will be enough
to estimate the order of magnitude of c2 (for values of a ∼ a∗(t)). Thus,
there is no need to derive the full leading-order expression for c2 with all the
numerical constants.

From (64)-(67) it follows that, unlike c1, the second cumulant c2 involves
the entire initial correlation function B0ψ(x). Let us denote by ∆corr a typical
correlation length for the initial potential.13 We shall now distinguish those
contributions to (80) where the two arguments y1 and y2 are separated by
not more than ∆corr and those where the separation is larger or, possibly,
much larger, a case of interest when the initial correlation function has a slow
algebraic decrease. The former will be called “local” (loc.) and the latter
“non-local” (nloc.).

Using (64) and (80) we can estimate

and a width ∆k ∼ [∆corr]

Here, we make a short digression. There are instances where (∆corr/L0)2
can be large. Consider for instance a quasimonochromatic signal with a
−1 ≪ k0. In this
center wavenumber k0 ∼ L−1
case, the condition t/tnl ≫ 1 is not enough for the Poisson approximation
(69) to hold. The asymptotic regime described by Kida’s law is then obtained
much later. As long as tnl ≪ t ≪ tnl(∆corr/L0)2, the energy decays much
faster : E(t) ∼ L2
0/t2 (Gurbatov & Malakhov 1977). The physical reason for
this is a strong correlation of the shocks in the early stage of the evolution,
which prevents the rapid merging of shocks.14

Let us now turn to the non-local contribution to c2 which is important
only when n is not an even integer, so that there is an algebraic tail in the
correlation function :

B0ψ (x) ∼ σ2
ψ

n−1

,

∆corr

(cid:18)

x ≫ ∆corr.

(86)

Owing to this, when 1 < n < 2 the main contribution to c2 comes from the
non-local region where |y1 − y2| ≫ L0 while |y1|, |y2| ≤ L(t). Here, L(t) is
the integral scale at time t, given by (46).

The main technical diﬃculty now is that we have to express the inverse
matrix of correlations that appears in the exponent in the Gaussian joint
probability densities (64)-(67). Actually, there is no need to fully invert the
matrix. It is suﬃcient to note that when the points are far apart, correlations
become weak and the oﬀ-diagonal elements will be small compared to the

14Similar remarks can be made when the initial energy spectrum has a very long plateau

at intermediate wavenumbers.

28

diagonal ones. We may therefore invert perturbatively to ﬁrst order in the
oﬀ-diagonal elements. Furthermore, the velocity-velocity correlations and
the velocity-potential correlations decay much faster with separation than
the potential-potential correlations. Therefore, it is consistent to keep in the
inverted matrix only oﬀ-diagonal elements proportional to B0ψ(yℓ − yℓ′). As
before we can substitute for the function Z(x) its value at the origin, (2π)− 1
2 .
After all these simpliﬁcations we can write the following expression for the
non-local part of the second cumulant c2 :

Here, the subscript NL (non-local) is a reminder that we only integrate over

the evaluation of c1, we change the variables y1, y2 and A into the dimen-
sionless variables z1, z2 and a, respectively and obtain, using (86) :

The integral (88) is estimated in the following way : the exponentials
eﬀectively delimit the region of integration to a circle in the (z1, z2)-plane
with radius l(t) ∼ (t/(atnl))1/2. Inside this circle, most of the factors in (88)
are of order unity. Therefore, we can estimate the non-local part of c2 as

Comparison with (84) indicates that the non-local part of c2 is much larger
than the local one, but still small compared to unity, so that we may indeed
neglect c2 compared to c1.15 Let us observe that when n is just slightly larger
than one, an exceedingly long time may be needed before the asymptotic Kida
law applies since c2 is then just marginally smaller than c1.
Using similar procedures we can show that cloc.

for m > 2
are even smaller than the c2-corrections. This establishes the validity of the
Kida law (48) at long times.

6 The correlation function at long times and
the preservation of long-range correlations

In this section we calculate the (spatial) correlation function of the poten-
tial at long times for the solution to the Burgers equation, using a Balian–
Schaeﬀer formula, adapted now to the evaluation of two-point quantities.

15This statement holds provided only upcrossings or only downcrossings between the
graphs G1 and G2 are counted. Otherwise, two things happen : (i) the mean number of
crossings and hence c1 is doubled; (ii) strong correlations are present between successive up
and down large-ordinate crossings; these invalidate the Poisson approximation; actually,
the coeﬃcient c2 becomes large and exactly cancels the aforementioned factor two.

30

As we shall see, in evaluating the far tail of the correlation function, the
dominant contribution will come from the second rather than from the ﬁrst
cumulant.

For reasons of symmetry we take the following deﬁnition for the correla-

tion function of the potential :

Bψ(x, t) = hψ(x/2, t)ψ(−x/2, t)i − hψ(x, t)i2,

(93)

from which the the velocity correlation function is obtained as

Bv(x, t) = −

∂2Bψ(x, t)
∂x2

.

(94)

To evaluate (93) we need, in addition to the one point probability density
P1(A, t), the joint probability density P2(A, B; x, t) of the potential at the
same time t for two points with spatial separation x. From (93), we obtain

Bψ =

AB(P2(A, B; x, t) − P1(A, t)P1(B, t)) dAdB.

(95)

Z Z

We also introduce the cumulative probability Q2(A, B; x, t), related to P2(A, B; x, t)
by

P2(A, B; x, t) =

Q2(A, B; x, t).

(96)

∂2
∂A∂B

Using this in (95) and integrating by parts twice, we have

Here, we have assumed from the start that t ≫ tnl, to replace Z(x) by
Z(0) = (2π)−1/2.

It may now be checked that (102) behaves in diﬀerent ways depending on

how the widths of the Gaussians compare to the separation x.

As long as x is smaller than or comparable to the integral scale L(t) given
by (47), the leading-order term in (100) is found to be c1, that is, the Poisson
approximation remains valid. One then derives the expressions (50)-(51) for
the correlation function previously obtained by Kida (1979), Gurbatov &
Saichev (1981) and Molchanov, Surgailis & Woyczynski (1995). Actually, to
derive the self-similarly evolving correlation function given by (50), the only
possible spatial scaling factor is (up to a multiplicative constant) the integral
scale L(t) given by (47). It may also be checked that L(t) is (up to a constant
factor) equal to hψ2(t)i1/2/hv2(t)i1/2

When |x| ≫ L(t) the situation is quite diﬀerent. Now, the two parabolas
intersect at a very large ordinate so that, to leading order, we have two
independent integrations over two diﬀerent almost complete parabolas. Thus,
to leading order, we have

c1(A, B; x, t) ≃ c1(A, t) + c1(B, t),

x ≫ L(t).

(104)

This, however, implies

Q2(A, B; x, t) − Q1(A, t)Q1(B, t) ≃ exp{−c1(A, t) − c1(B, t)}

− exp{−c1(A, t)} exp{−c1(B, t)} = 0,

(105)

which, in turn, implies the vanishing of Bψ(x, t). It follows that the leading-
order contribution cannot come from the Poisson approximation.

This leading-order contribution actually comes from the second order

cumulant

where F1 and F2 are now the one- and two-particle densities constructed from
the crossings of the G1 and G2 graphs deﬁned in (99). It may be checked

to the correlation function goes to zero with separation even faster than the
c1-contribution and is not relevant.

Just as in Section 5.1, the joint probability density of A, B is localized in a
narrow region near A ≃ B ≃ hψi ≃ σψ(ln t/2πtnl)1/2. We introduce in (108)

We now evaluate the correlation of the potential (97) for |x| ≫ L(t). For
this we use (100), truncated to its ﬁrst two terms (108) and (110), and the
fact that B0ψ(x) is small, so that we can expand exponentials with B0ψ(x)
in their arguments. We ﬁnally obtain :

Bψ(x, t) ≃ B0ψ(x),

t ≫ tnl,

|x| ≫ L(t).

(111)

This establishes the preservation of long-range correlations, an instance

of the permanence of large eddies (PLE), as deﬁned in Section 3.

7 The global picture at long times

We are now in a position to derive the main results of this paper, some of
which have already been presented in a phenomenological way in Section 3.

35

Our derivation of the Kida law (48) for the energy decay in Section 5,
using the Balian–Schaeﬀer formula, proves the validity of this law for any
n > 1 and not just n > 2 as thought previously. Similarly, for any n > 1 the
integral scale L(t) is given by (47).

More novel results emerge when considering the global structure, at long
times, for the correlation function (in physical space) and for its Fourier
transform, the energy spectrum. We shall consider only the situation at
scales larger than the integral scale L(t). Indeed, we have already stated in
Section 6 that, at scales small or comparable to the integral scale, we recover
known results (see Kida 1979; Gurbatov, Malakhov & Saichev 1991).

We observe that for any n > 1 which is not an even integer the correlation
function Bv(x) has two diﬀerent asymptotic regions. In an “outer asymptotic
region” at extremely large x, permanence of large eddies (in the form (111)
established in Section 6) implies that

Bv(x, t) ≃ Bv(x, 0) ≃ Cnα2|x|−n−1,

|x| → ∞.

(112)

There is also an “inner asymptotic region” where the correlation function has
the (approximately) Gaussian decrease given by (53) in dimensionless form
with ˜x = x/L(t). Using (25) we can rewrite this in dimensioned form as

Bv

≃ −

32

exp

−

,

(113)

which can be reexpressed in terms solely of L(t), using u(t) = ˙L(t). The
separation ls(t) at which the correlation function switches from its inner to
its outer form, called here the switching distance, is obtained by equating
(112) and (113), yielding16

ls(t) ∼ L(t)

(n − 1) ln

(cid:18)

1/2

.

t
tnl (cid:19)(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(114)

Hence, the switching distance is only logarithmically larger than the integral
scale.17 Still, the fact that L(t) and ls(t) have (slightly) diﬀerent scaling laws

16To truly characterize the transition from the inner to outer asymptotic expansion it is
necessary to perform matched asymptotic expansions which require more than the leading
order. Equating the leading-order inner and outer terms correctly predicts the order of
magnitude of the scale at which this transition takes place.

17When n is an even integer the algebraic outer region disappears altogether.

36

in time implies that, globally, the correlation function does not evolve in a
self-similar fashion.

This phenomenon becomes much more prominent if we consider the en-
ergy spectrum, the Fourier transform of the correlation function. In dimen-
sionless inner-region variables, the energy spectrum has the following form
(Gurbatov, Malakhov & Saichev 1991) :

˜E(˜k) ≃

0.36˜k−2, ˜k ≫ 1




1.08˜k2, ˜k ≪ 1

,

˜k ≡ kL(t).

(115)

The ˜k−2 region is the signature of shocks and will not interest us further,
while the ˜k2 region comes about because the (inner) correlation function of
the potential has a non-vanishing integral from −∞ to +∞. In dimensioned
variables the small-k inner-region behavior of the spectrum is thus

(cid:18)

(117)

Instead of a Gaussian region (in physical space), we have a spectrum with
an algebraic k2 region and a time-dependent coeﬃcient A(t).

We must now distinguish two cases. When n > 2, the k2 contribution
(116) dominates everywhere over the |k|n contribution, the latter being then
only a subdominant term in the small-k expansion.18 The more interesting
case is 1 < n < 2, already sketched in Fig. 1. The permanence of large eddies
implies now that, at extremely small k,

E(k, t) ≃ α2|k|n,

for k → 0,

(118)

This relation holds only in an outer region |k| ≪ ks(t) where (118) dominates
over (116). The switching wavenumber ks(t), obtained by equating (116) and
(118), is given by

and moderately small wavenumbers,
communication).

37

Some comments are now made. First, it may seem paradoxical that the
switching wavenumber ks(t) is not the inverse of the switching distance ls(t).
The reason is that in physical space we have a Gaussian competing with
a power law, whereas in Fourier space we have two power laws competing;
this renders inapplicable na¨ıve Fourier phenomenology in which distances are
roughly inverse wavenumbers. Second, let us deﬁne an energy wavenumber
kL(t) = L−1(t), which is roughly the wavenumber around which most of
the kinetic energy resides. From (47) kL(t) ∼ (tσψ)−1/2 (ignoring logarithmic
corrections). We then have from (119), still ignoring logarithmic corrections :

Hence, the switching wavenumber goes to zero much faster than the energy
wavenumber : in Fourier space the separation of the two regions is much more
manifest. This is why the results of the numerical simulations in Section 8
will be presented in Fourier space.

(120)

.

Let us also observe that the ratio of the energy in the outer region to
the total energy, a measure of how well the Kida law is satisﬁed, is equal to
(t/tnl)
(up to logarithms) and thus becomes very small when t ≫ tnl,
unless n is very close to unity.

− 3(n−1)
n−2

Thus, we have established the central claim of this paper, namely that for
1 < n < 2 there is no globally self-similar evolution of the energy spectrum.
Of course, as n → 2 the inner k2 region overwhelms the outer |k|n region and
as n → 1 the converse happens, so that in both instances global self-similarity
tends to be reestablished.

8 Numerical experiments

The purpose of this section is to obtain numerical conﬁrmation of the rather
unusual long-time regime predicted by the theory when the spectral exponent
n is between one and two. There should then be three diﬀerent power-law
regions in the energy spectrum :
E(k) ∝ |k|−2

for |k| ≫ L−1(t);
for ks(t) ≪ |k| ≪ L−1(t);

E(k) ∝ |k|2

(121)

E(k) ∝ |k|n

for |k| ≪ ks(t),

38

where ks(t) and L(t) are given by (119) and (47), respectively.

Clearly, such simulations require extremely high spatial resolution since
three power-law ranges are present. Fortunately, for the Burgers equation
there is no need to numerically integrate (1) : advantage can be taken of the
maximum representation (7) to directly construct, from the initial data, the
solution in the limit of vanishing viscosity at any given time t. The principles
of the method have been presented in detail elsewhere (She, Aurell & Frisch
1992; Noullez & Vergassola 1994; Vergassola et al. 1994; Aurell, Gurbatov
& Simdyankin 1996) and will only be brieﬂy recalled here.

The method exploits two observations. First, the maximum representa-
tion (7) becomes a Legendre transformation after expansion of the quadratic
term. Second, when the problem is discretized on a grid of N points, the
search for the maximizing Lagrangian point a(x, t) can be done by a di-
chotomic procedure which uses the non-decreasing property of the inverse
Lagrangian map. The number of operations can thus be reduced from a
brute-force estimate O(N 2) to O(N ln2 N).

In the simulations it is of course necessary to introduce both large-scale
and small-scale cutoﬀs. The small-scale cutoﬀ must be chosen suﬃciently
small compared to the integral scale to leave room for a k−2 inertial range.
Since the integral scale grows with the time, this constraint is not very strin-
gent. In practice, we take the initial integral scale about a factor ten larger
than the mesh.

For the large-scale cutoﬀ, we assume periodic boundary conditions which
facilitate Fourier transformations and make no signiﬁcant diﬀerence as long
as we analyse scales much smaller than the spatial periodicity.

In our simulations, the maximum wavenumber is taken to be 1/2, so that
wavevectors run from ±1/N to ±1/2, where N is the resolution, that is
the number of grid points in physical space. In all our simulations we take
N = 221 ≈ 2 × 106. The energy spectrum for the initial Gaussian velocity is

With the chosen value of k0, the integral scale is around ten and the nonlinear
time around one hundred.

The initial potential is generated by fast Fourier transform (FFT) from
its Fourier coeﬃcients ˆψ0(k) which are complex Gaussian variables of vari-
ance h| ˆψ0(k)|2i = E0(k)/(Nk2). After the solutions at suitable output times
have been constructed with the procedure described above, they are Fourier
transformed and their energy spectra are calculated by averaging typically
over 103 realizations.19

The precise value of the spectral exponent 1 < n < 2 in our runs depends,
of course, on the particular tradeoﬀs desired : the closer n is to 1, the more
conspicuous is the persistence of the initial |k|n range; and the closer it is to
2, the more conspicuous is the (nonlinearly generated) k2 range. A natural
unit for the output times is t∗ = N 2. Indeed, we know from (47) that the
integral scale grows roughly as t1/2. Thus t∗ is roughly the time needed for
the integral scale to grow from an initial value O(1) to a value comparable
to the largest scale available in the simulation, which is O(N). In practice,
we take output times

ti = 10i−6 N 2,

i = 1, 2, . . . , 8.

(124)

We describe now the results of our numerical experiments. Fig. 5 shows
the evolution of the spectrum for n = 1.7 and is mostly meant to bring out
qualitative aspects. At large wavenumbers a k−2 inertial range develops very
quickly.20 At short times the spectrum preserves its initial value at all but
the largest wavenumbers, in accordance with the permanence of large eddies.
The wavenumber where the spectrum achieves its maximum, which we use
as an operational measure of the inverse integral scale at time t,21 moves to
smaller and smaller wavenumbers. At large times the spectrum appears to
change in a self-similar way.

19This Monte Carlo procedure is easily parallelized in the implementation on an IBM

20The time scale for shocks to develop is tnl.
21It is actually almost exactly equal to this (see Gurbatov, Malakhov & Saichev 1991,

N = 221. Spectra averaged over 103 realizations. The labels correspond to
output times ti = 10i−6 N 2, (i = 1, 2, . . . 8).

We turn to a more quantitative description. Fig. 6 shows the energy
spectrum at the third output time t3 = 10−3 N 2. We also plot the initial
spectrum with its |k|n tail which should be preserved at small wavenumbers
(leading term of outer expansion) and the leading term of the inner expan-
sion, obtained by Fourier transformation of (50), which has a k2 tail at small
wavenumbers. The intersection of the latter two is the switching wavenumber
ks(t) as deﬁned by (119). It is seen that, except in the immediate neighbor-
hood of the switching wavenumber, the leading terms of the inner and outer
expansions are in very good agreement with our simulations.

Fig. 7, communicated by A. Noullez, gives additional evidence for the

permanence of large eddies.

We examine now the temporal evolution of various quantities for which
we have theoretical predictions. Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the integral
scale compared to the theoretical prediction(47). The agreement is excellent
provided that the logarithmic correction is taken into account. By (28) and
(29) this also implies the validity of Kida’s log-corrected law for the energy
decay. Fig. 9 shows the corresponding information for the coeﬃcient A(t).

Fig. 10 shows the evolution of the switching wavenumber ks(t), compared
with the theory (119). Finally, Fig. 11 shows the evolution of the switching
wavenumber, but now for a spectral index n = 1.5. The agreement with the
leading-order theory is slightly better than for n = 1.7.

9 Concluding remarks

The main conclusions have already been presented in Section 7 (see also the
Abstract). Here, we make additional comments.

We have given an explicit formula only for the leading-order term of the
law of energy decay. The higher-order terms have just been bounded : they
appear to be smaller (in relative terms) by negative powers of the time t. It
would be useful to have explicit expressions for the subdominant terms.

Our derivation of the law of energy decay uses an asymptotic expression
for the probability of non-crossing of the initial potential and suitable parabo-

las. Kida’s (1979) original derivation obtained this from the distribution of
shocks, which he related to the distribution of (high local) maxima in the
initial potential. Actually, it should be possible to reformulate our theory
in terms of maxima rather than of upcrossings. Roughly, we expect that
high-level upcrossings should occur very close to high-level maxima. This
statement cannot be exactly true since two successive up- and downcrossings
of the (initial) potential with a parabola need not be separated by a maximum
of the potential. However, crossings of a parabola having a high-lying apex
are very likely to happen in the ﬂat region near the apex of the parabola
where up- and downcrossings are separated by a maximum. Quantifying
such remarks would be of special interest for extension of the theory to the
multidimensional Burgers equation. Indeed, in d > 1 space dimensions, the
equivalent of the crossings are (d−1)-dimensional manifolds for which the ex-
tension of the method presented here is far from straightforward. But (local)
maxima are still point processes and can be handled via the d-dimensional
version of the Balian–Schaeﬀer formula (Balian & Schaeﬀer 1989).

There are a number of other interesting extensions of the present work,
such as the eﬀect of viscosity and of non-Gaussian initial potentials. Instances
of these have already been studied by Funaki, Surgailis & Woyczynski (1995),
Surgailis (1996), Hu & Woyczynski (1996) and Surgailis (1997).

Finally, a completely open question is the extension of the present ideas
to three-dimensional incompressible turbulence. Does the mechanism which
prevents globally self-similar decay for 1 < n < 2 have a counterpart for the
Navier–Stokes problem ?

Appendix

A The Balian–Schaeﬀer formula for “parti-

cle” distributions

The original work of Balian & Schaeﬀer (1989) was concerned with the fol-
lowing type of problem. One has a distribution of “particles” (galaxies, in
the applications considered by them) in the three-dimensional space which
is homogeneous, i.e. translation-invariant and one wants to determine the
probability that there is no particle at all within some ﬁnite domain. For the
application to the Burgers equation, the role of the particles will be played
by the upcrossings between the initial potential and a given parabola, which
constitute a point process in the sense of Leadbetter, Lindgren & Rootzen
(1983). Although the potential is a homogeneous random function, the pres-
ence of the parabola makes our problem inhomogeneous. Furthermore, our

47

domain is the whole real line and is thus not bounded.22 Nevertheless, our
approach will remain rather close in spirit to the original Balian–Schaeﬀer
approach. In the remainder of this appendix we shall use the word “particle”
rather than “intersection”, since the formalism has obviously applications
beyond the Burgers equation.

Let there be given a random set of particles on the real line. The total
number of particles is assumed to be random but almost surely ﬁnite. We
are actually interested in ﬁnding the probability of having no particle at all.
We shall characterize this random set by the so-called n-particle densities.
F1(y1) dy1 is the probability of having a particle within the interval [y1, y1 +
dy1]. Similarly, Fn(y1, y2, . . . , yn) dy1dy2 . . . dyn is the probability of having
(at least) n diﬀerent particles within, respectively, the intervals [y1, y1 + dy1],
[y2, y2 + dy2], . . . and, ﬁnally, [yn, yn + dyn]. Note that when the particles
are independent (an assumption not made here), Fn is just a product of F1
factors. Note also that the Fns are not normalized. For example
F1(y1)dy1
is the mean number of particles.23 Balian and Schaeﬀer’s work leads to
expressions for pn, the probability of having exactly n particles in the domain,
in terms of the Fns. We shall here concentrate on the evaluation of p0, the
probability of having no particle at all.

R

We begin by introducing the exclusive n-particle densities corresponding
to the case where there are exactly n particles. Pn(y1, y2, . . . , yn) dy1dy2 . . . dyn
is the probability of having a particle within the interval [y1, y1+dy1], another
particle within the interval [y2, y2 + dy2], . . . , a particle within the interval
[yn, yn + dyn] and no other particle. Observe that

Pn(y1, y2, . . . , yn) dy1dy2 . . . dyn = n! pn.

(A.1)

Z

The factor n! is present because the Pns are here deﬁned for unlabeled par-
ticles. We shall use (A.1) to calculate pn for n = 1, 2, .. and then obtain p0
from the obvious relation

p0 = 1 − p1 − p2 − . . . pn − . . . ,

(A.2)

22The formalism developed hereafter applies identically to bounded and unbounded
domains. The integral sign will always denote a simple or multiple integration over the
whole domain.

23This follows from the observation that the mean number of particles in the interval
1 ) from the probability of having one particle within the

[y1, y1 + dy1] diﬀers by O(dy2
interval [y1, y1 + dy1].

expressing that the total probability is unity.

We show now that the pns may be expressed in terms of the Fns. First
we relate the Fns to the Pns. To have a particle in [y1, y1 + dy1] we must have
one of the following mutually exclusive situations : (i) a total of exactly one
particle in [y1, y1 + dy1], (ii) a total of exactly two particles, one of them in
[y1, y1 + dy1] and the other one at any place, . . . . Hence,

The presence of the factorials in the denominators comes again from the
unlabeled character of the particles. Similarly, we have

Fn(y1, . . . yn) =

Pn+l(y1, . . . yn, yn+1, . . . , yn+l)dyn+1 . . . dyn+l. (A.4)

Next we introduce the quantities

Figure 1: Sketch of the energy spectrum at long times when 1 < n < 2.

Figure 2: Intersections of the initial potential ψ0(y) (curve G1) with the parabola

G2.

Figure 3: Intersections of the initial potential ψ0 with two parabolas.

Figure 4: The diﬀerent regions of integration appearing in (106). Near the diag-
onal y1 = y2 we have regions I and I’ of (107). Away from the diagonal
we have regions II and II’.

Figure 5: Evolution of the energy spectrum with an initial spectrum (dashed line)
proportional to kn (n = 1.7) at small wavenumbers k. Resolution N =
221. Spectra averaged over 103 realizations. The labels correspond to
output times ti = 10i−6 N 2, (i = 1, 2, . . . 8).

Figure 6: Energy spectrum at t = t3 = 10−3 N 2. Same conditions as Fig. 5.
Initial spectrum : dashed line. Leading-order asymptotic theory in inner
region : dotted line. The vertical line shows the switching wavenumber.
Figure 7: Evolution of the energy spectrum compensated by a k−n factor in order
to reveal the region of “permanence of large eddies” (PLE) as a plateau
with unit height. Spectral exponent n = 1.5. Resolution N = 220.
Spectra averaged over 30,000 realizations. The unit of time is diﬀerent
from the other ﬁgures, the spatial period being here unity. Observe the
progressive shrinking of the PLE zone. (Courtesy A. Noullez.)

Figure 8: Evolution of the computed integral scale L(t) (asterisks) compared to
the theoretical leading-order prediction (solid line) and the same with-
out the logarithmic correction (dashed line). Same conditions as Fig. 5.
Figure 9: Evolution of the coeﬃcient A(t) in front of the k2 term at intermediate
wavenumbers (asterisks), compared to the leading-order theoretical pre-
diction (117) (solid line) and the same without its logarithmic correction
(dashed line). Same conditions as Fig. 5.

Figure 10: Evolution of the switching wavenumber ks(t), compared to the leading-
order theoretical prediction (119) (solid line) and the same without its
logarithmic correction (dashed line). Same conditions as Fig. 5.

Figure 11: Evolution of the switching wavenumber ks(t) for n = 1.5. Otherwise,

everything as in Fig. 10.

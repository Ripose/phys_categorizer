The general stability criteria of two-dimensional inviscid rotating ﬂow with angular velocity Ω(r)
are obtained analytically. First, a necessary instability criterion for centrifugal ﬂows is derived as

is the vortictiy of proﬁle
and Ωs is the angular velocity at the inﬂection point ξ′ = 0. Second, a criterion for stability is
found as −(µ1 + 1/r2) < f (r) = ξ
Ω−Ωs < 0, where µ1 is an eigenvalue. The new criteria are the
analogues of the theorems for parallel ﬂows. And the criteria for parallel ﬂows can also be derived
from those for the rotating ﬂows. All of these criteria are special cases of Arnol’d’s nonlinear criteria.
These results extend the former theorems and would intrigue future research on the mechanism of
hydrodynamic instability.

The instability of the rotating ﬂows is one of the most
attractive problems in many ﬁelds, such as ﬂuid dynam-
ics, astrophysical hydrodynamics, oceanography, meteo-
rology, etc. Among the rotating ﬂows, the simplest one
is the ﬂow between coaxial cylinders, i.e., Taylor-Couette
ﬂow, which has intensively been explored [1, 2]. There
are two kinds of instabilities in the rotating ﬂows. One
is known as centrifugal instability, which was ﬁrst in-
vestigated by Rayleigh [3]. He derived the circulation
criterion for the inviscid rotating ﬂows that a necessary
and suﬃcient condition for stability to axisymmetric dis-
turbances is that the square of the circulation does not
decrease anywhere [2, 3]. The other is known as shear
instability in rotating ﬂows. For the shear instability,
Rayleigh also obtained a criterion, i.e., inﬂection point
theorem in rotating ﬂows, which is the analogue of the
theorem in parallel ﬂows [3]. Also in cases of inviscid
parallel shear ﬂows, Fjørtoft [4] and Sun [5] have investi-
gated some more restrictively general criteria for the lin-
ear stability. Besides, Arnol’d [6] obtained two nonlinear
stable criteria for barotropic ﬂows, which are equivalent
to the linear ones [2, 5, 7]. Unfortunately, Arnol’d’s non-
linear stability criteria are seldom known and diﬃcultly
be applied due to their mathematical complex. There
are still no criteria corresponding to Arnol’d’s for the ro-
tating ﬂows, thus only some special velocity proﬁles can
be studied. The lack of general stable criteria for rota-
tion ﬂows blocks the further exploration, the aim of this
letter is to obtain such criteria for the inviscid rotating
ﬂows, and other instabilities may be understood via the
investigation here.

For this purpose, Howard-Gupta equation (hereafter
H-G equation) [8] is employed. To obtain H-G equa-
tion, Euler’s equations [1, 2, 9, 10] for incompressible
barotropic ﬂow in cylindrical polar coordinates (r, θ) are

unstable if and only if ωi > 0. In this way, the amplitude

We will prove the criterion by two steps. At ﬁrst, we
prove proposition 1:
if the velocity proﬁle is subject to

where c = ω/n = cr + ici is the complex angular phase
speed. Rayleigh used only Eq.(11) to prove his theorem:
The necessary condition for instability is that the gradi-
ent of the basic vorticity ξ′ must change sign at least once
in the interval r1 < r < r2. The point at r = rs is called
the inﬂection point with ξ′
s = 0, at which the angular
velocity of Ωs = Ω(rs). This theorem is the analogue of
Rayleigh’s inﬂection point theorem for parallel ﬂow.

Similar to the proof of Fjørtoft theorem [4] in the par-

allel ﬂow, we can prove the following criterion.

Theorem 1: A necessary condition for instability is
that ξ′(Ω − Ωs) < 0 (or ξ′/(Ω − Ωs) < 0) somewhere in
the ﬂow ﬁeld.

The proof of Theorem 1 is trivial, and is omitted here.
This criterion is more restrictive than Rayleigh’s. More-
over, some more restrictive criteria may also be found, if
we follow the way given by Sun [5]. Unlike the former
proofs, the problem is considered in an other way. If the
velocity proﬁle of Ω(r) is stable (ci = 0), then the hypoth-
esis ci 6= 0 should result in contradictions in some cases.
So that a more restrictive criterion can be obtained.

where the eigenvalue µ is positive deﬁnition for φ 6= 0.
According to boundary condition Eq.(7), φ can expand as
Fourier series. So the smallest eigenvalue value, namely
µ1, can be estimated as µ1 > r1π2/(r2 − r1)2.

Then there is a criterion for stability using Poincar´e’s
relation (12), a new stability criterion may be found: the
ﬂow is stable if −µ1 < ξ′

Ω−Ωs < 0 everywhere.

To get this criterion, we introduce an auxiliary function
Ω−Ωs , where f (r) is ﬁnite at inﬂection point.

f (r) = ξ′

i = 0.

Proof: Otherwise if c2

i 6= 0, then multiplying Eq.(11)
by (cr − ct)/ci, where the arbitrary real number ct does
not depend on r, and adding the result to Eq.(10), it
satisﬁes

But the above Eq.(15) can not be hold for some special
ct. For example, let ct = 2cr − Ωs, then there is (Ω −
Ωs)(Ω − ct) < kΩ − ck2, and
ξ′(Ω − ct)

which also contradicts Eq.(15). So the second proposition
is also proved.

Using ’proposition 1: if −(µ1 + 1/r2) < f (r) < 0 then
cr 6= Ωs’ and ’proposition 2: if −(µ1 + 1/r2) < f (r) < 0
and cr 6= Ωs then ci = 0’, we ﬁnd a stability criterion.

Theorem 2:

If the velocity proﬁle satisfy −(µ1 +

1/r2) < f (r) < 0 everywhere in the ﬂow, it is stable.

This criterion is the analogue of the theorem proved
by Sun [5]. Both theorem 1 and theorem 2 here are more
restrictive than Rayleigh’s theorem for the inviscid rotat-
ing ﬂows. The theorems indicate the probability that a
vorticity proﬁle with local maximum or minimum would
be stable, if it satisﬁes the stable criteria. Theorem 2 im-
plies that the rotating ﬂow is stable, if the distribution
of vorticity is relatively smooth. As shown by Sun [5],
the instability of inviscid parallel ﬂows must have vor-
tices concentrated enough. This is also the instability for
rotating shear ﬂows.

Since there are several stable criteria for inviscid ﬂows
have been obtained, it is convenient to explore the re-
lationship among them. First, the centrifugal
insta-
bility criteria are consistent with each other. Pedley

FIG. 1: Angular velocity Ω (solid line) and corresponding

[12] considered the stability of two-dimensional ﬂows
U in a frame rotating with angular velocity Ω. A
criterion is found that instability occurs locally when
2Ω(2Ω − U ′) < 0. Pedley’s criterion, which is recovered
by later researches [13, 14], is in essence the special case of
Rayleigh’s circulation criterion, i.e., d
dr (Ω2r4) < 0 for in-
stability. Given the narrow-gap approximation r2 − r1 =
d ≪ r1 and the large radii approximation 1/r1 → 0 in
Rayleigh’s circulation criterion, then Ω′r ≈ −U ′. So that
Pedley’s criterion is the special case of Rayleigh’s circu-
lation criterion. Second, the stable criteria for parallel
ﬂows, such as Rayleigh’s theorem [3] and Fjørtfot’s the-
orem [4], can be derived from those for rotating ﬂows,
given the narrow-gap approximation r2 − r1 = d ≪ r1
and the large radii approximation 1/r1 → 0. Following
this way, the results of the Taylor-Couette system can
also be applied to the plane Couette system [15]. Since
the approach is trivial, it is omitted here.
In fact, all
of the shear instability criteria are the special cases of
Arnol’d’s nonlinear criteria [5, 6], which are much more

3

complex and not widely used.

As mentioned above, there are two diﬀerent kinds of
instabilities in the rotating ﬂows. These instabilities
are independent with each other. For a general ba-
sic angular velocity Ω, Rayleigh’s circulation criterion
is known to be invalid for the non-axisymmetric distur-
bances [2, 8]. On the other hand, Rayleigh’s inﬂection
point criterion might also be invalid for the axisymmet-
ric disturbances. To illuminate this, a simple example is
given as Ω(r) = 1 − r with the vorticity ξ = 2 − 3r. As
shown in Fig. 1, both Ω (solid line) and ξ (dashed line)
are plotted within the interval r1 ≤ r ≤ r2. It is from
Rayleigh’s circulation criterion that the ﬂow is stable to
two dimensional disturbances. While the ﬂow is unsta-
ble for the axisymmetric disturbances, if 2/3 < r1 < 1 or
2/3 < r2 < 1. Then, a shear stable ﬂow may be unsta-
ble due to centrifugal instability. Consider that there are
three-dimensional disturbances, even the centrifugal sta-
ble and shear stable ﬂow could be unstable. This might
be the reason why there is no general criterion known for
H-G equation when non-axisymmetric disturbances are
considered [8].

In summary, the general stability criterion is obtained
for inviscid rotating ﬂow. These results extend Rayleigh’s
inﬂection point theorem for curved and rotating ﬂows,
and they are analogue of the theorems proved by Fjørtoft
and Sun for the two-dimensional inviscid parallel ﬂows.
Moreover, the theorems for the parallel ﬂows can be de-
rived from those for the rotating ﬂows, given narrow-gap
and large radii approximations. And it also shed light on
the ﬂow control and investigation of the vortex dynamics.

Pr´ecis

During the March 2000 meeting of the Workshop on Strings, Duality, and Geometry in
Montr´eal, Canada, I delivered three lectures on topics in ﬂuid mechanics, while titulary of
the Aisenstadt Chair. Three more lectures were presented in June 2000, during the Montr´eal
Workshop on Integrable Models in Condensed Matter and Non-Equilibrium Physics. Here are
brief descriptive remarks on the content of the lectures.

1. Introduction – The motivation for the research is explained.

2. Classical Equations – The classical theory is reviewed, but in a manner diﬀerent from

textbook discussions.

(a) Equations of motion – Summary of conservation and Euler equations.

(b) A word on canonical formulations – An advertisement of the method for ﬁnding the

canonical structure for the above (developed with L.D. Faddeev).

(c) The irrotational case – C. Eckart’s Lagrangian and a relativistic generalization for

vortex-free motion.

(d) Nonvanishing vorticity and the Clebsch parameterization – In the presence of vor-
ticity, the velocity Chern-Simons term (kinetic helicity) provides an obstruction to
the construction of a Lagrangian for the motion. C.C. Lin’s method overcomes the
obstruction, and leads to the Clebsch parameterization for the velocity vector.

(e) Some further remarks on the Clebsch parameterization – Properties and peculiarities

of this presentation for a 3-vector.

3. Speciﬁc Models – Nonrelativistic and relativistic ﬂuid mechanics in spatial dimensions

greater than one.

(a) Galileo-invariant nonrelativistic model – The Chaplygin gas [negative pressure, in-
versely proportional to density] is studied, selected solutions are presented, unex-
pected symmetries are identiﬁed.

(b) Lorentz-invariant relativistic model – The scalar Born-Infeld model is found to be
the relativistic generalization of the Chaplygin gas, and shares with it unexpected
symmetries.

(c) Some remarks on relativistic ﬂuid mechanics – Dynamics for isentropic relativistic
ﬂuids is given a Lagrangian formulation, and the Born-Infeld model is ﬁtted into
that framework.

4. Common Ancestry: The Nambu-Goto Action – Both the Chaplygin gas and the Born-
Infeld model devolve from the parameterization-invariant Nambu-Goto action, when spe-
ciﬁc parameterization is made.

(a) Light-cone parameterization – Chaplygin gas is derived.

(b) Cartesian parameterization – Born-Infeld model is derived.

6

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

(c) Hodographic transformation – Chaplygin gas is derived (again).

(d) Interrelations – The Chaplygin gas and Born-Infeld are related because (1) the former
is the nonrelativistic limit of the latter; (2) both descend from the same Nambu-Goto
action.

5. Supersymmetric Generalization – Fluid mechanics enhanced by supersymmetry.

(a) Chaplygin gas with Grassmann variables – Vorticity is parameterized by Grassmann

variables, which act like Gaussian potentials of the Clebsch parameterization.

(b) Supersymmetry

–

Supercharges,

transformations

generated

by

them, and their algebra.

(c) Supermembrane connection – Supermembrane Lagrangian in three spatial dimen-

sions.

(d) Hodographic transformation – Supersymmetric Chaplygin gas in two spatial dimen-

sions is derived.

(e) Light-cone parameterization – Supersymmetric Chaplygin gas in two spatial dimen-

sions is derived (again).

(f) Further consequences of the supermembrane connection – Hidden symmetries of the

supersymmetric model.

6. One-dimensional Case – The previous models in one spatial dimension are completely

integrable.

(a) Solutions for the Chaplygin gas on a line – Some special solutions are presented;
inﬁnite number of constants of motion is identiﬁed; Riemann coordinates are intro-
duced and the ﬂuid equations as well as constants of motion are expressed in terms
of them.

(b) Aside on the integrability of the cubic potential in one dimension – The one-dimen-
sional problem with pressure ∝ (density)3 possesses the SO(2,1) “Schr¨odinger sym-
metry” and the equations of motion, in Riemann form, become free.

(c) General solution of the Chaplygin gas on a line – Solution obtained by linearization.

(d) Born-Infeld model on a line – When formulated in terms of its Riemann coordinates,

it becomes trivially equivalent to the Chaplygin gas.

(e) General solution of the Nambu-Goto theory for a (d = 1)-brane (string) in two
spatial dimensions (on a plane) – The explicit string solution is transformed by a
hodographic transformation to the Chaplygin gas solution, and a relation is estab-
lished between this solution and the one found by linearization.

7. Towards a Non-Abelian Fluid Mechanics – Motivation for this theory is given.

(a) Proposal for non-Abelian ﬂuid mechanics – A Lagrangian is proposed; it involves a
non-Abelian auxiliary ﬁeld whose Chern-Simons density should be a total derivative.

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

(b) Non-Abelian Clebsch parameterization (or, casting the non-Abelian Chern-Simons
density into total derivative form) – Total derivative form for the non-Abelian Chern-
Simons density is found, thereby generalizing the Abelian Clebsch parameterization,
which achieves a total derivative form for the Abelian density.

(c) Proposal for non-Abelian magnetohydrodynamics – Our proposal, which generalizes
the one in Section 7.1 to include a dynamical non-Abelian gauge ﬁeld, reduces in
the Abelian limit to conventional magnetohydrodynamics.

1 Introduction

Field theory, as developed by particle physicists in the last quarter century, has enjoyed a
tremendous expansion in concepts and calculational possibilities.

We learned about higher and unexpected symmetries, and discovered evidence for partial
or complete integrability facilitated by these symmetries. We appreciated the relevance of
topological ideas and structures, like solitons and instantons, and introduced new dynamical
quantities, like the Chern-Simons terms in odd-dimensional gauge theories. We enlarged and
uniﬁed numerous degrees of freedom by introducing organizing principles such as non-Abelian
symmetries and supersymmetries. Indeed, application of ﬁeld theory to particle physics has
now been replaced by the study of fundamentally extended structures like strings and mem-
branes, which bring with them new mathematically intricate ideas.

Thinking about research possibilities, I decided to investigate whether the novelties that
we have introduced into particle physics ﬁeld theory can be used in a diﬀerent, non-particle
physics, yet still ﬁeld-theoretic context. In these Aisenstadt lectures I shall describe an ap-
proach to ﬂuid mechanics, which is an ancient ﬁeld theory, but which can be enhanced by the
ideas that we gleaned from particle physics.

As an introduction, I shall begin with a review of the classical theory. Mostly, I duplicate
what can be found in textbooks, but perhaps the emphasis will be new and diﬀerent. After
this I shall describe how some instances of the classical theory are related to d-branes and
how this relation explains some integrability properties of various models. I shall then show
how the degrees of freedom can be enlarged to accomodate supersymmetry and non-Abelian
structures in ﬂuid mechanics. A few problems are scattered throughout; solutions are given at
the end of the text, before the references.

New work that I shall describe here was done in collaboration with D. Bazeia, V.P. Nair,
S.-Y. Pi, and A.P. Polychronakos. Textbooks for the classical theory, which I recommend, are
by Landau and Lifschitz [1] as well as by Arnold and Khesin [2].

2 Classical Equations

2.1 Equations of motion

We begin with nonrelativistic equations that govern a matter density ﬁeld ρ(t, r) and a velocity
ﬁeld vector v(t, r), taken in any number of dimensions. The equations of motion comprise a
continuity equation,

∂
∂t

ρ(t, r) + ∇ ·(cid:0)ρ(t, r)v(t, r)(cid:1)= 0

(1)

which ensures matter conservation, that is, time independence, of N = R dr ρ, and Euler’s

equation, which is the expression of a nonrelativistic force law.

∂
∂t

v(t, r) + v(t, r) · ∇v(t, r) = f (t, r)

(2)

Here ρv is the current j and f is the force. We shall deal with an isentropic ﬂuid, that is,
entropy is constant and does not appear in our theory. Also we ignore dissipation and take
the force to be given by the pressure P : f = − 1
∇P . For isentropic motion P is a function
only of ρ, so f can also be written as −∇V ′(ρ):

ρ

f = −

1
ρ

∇P = −∇V ′(ρ)

(3)

with the dash (also known as “prime”) designating the derivative with respect to argument.

V ′(ρ) is the enthalpy, ρV ′(ρ) − V (ρ) = P (ρ), and pP ′(ρ) ≡ s is the speed of sound. (Those

familiar with the subject will recognize that I am using an Eulerian rather than a Lagrangian
description of a ﬂuid [3].)

The dynamics summarized in (1) and (2) and the deﬁnition (3) may be presented as

continuity equations for an energy momentum tensor. The energy density E = T oo

together with the energy ﬂux

obey

E = 1

2 ρv2 + V (ρ) = T oo

T jo = ρvj( 1

2 v2 + V ′)

∂
∂t

T oo + ∂jT jo = 0.

(4a)

(4b)

(4c)

Similarly the momentum density, which in the nonrelativistic theory coincides with the current,

P i = ρvi = T oi

(5a)

10

and the stress tensor T ij

satisfy

T ij = δij(ρV ′ − V ) + ρvivj = δij P + ρvivj

∂
∂t

T oi + ∂jT ji = 0.

(5b)

(5c)

Note that T oi 6= T io because the theory is not Lorentz invariant, but T ij = T ji because it is
[Thus T µν is not, properly speaking, a “tensor”, but an
invariant against spatial rotations.
energy-momentum “complex”.]

A simpliﬁcation occurs for the irrotational case when the vorticity

vanishes. For then the velocity can be given in terms of a velocity potential θ,

ωij ≡ ∂ivj − ∂jvi

and equation (2) can be replaced by Bernoulli’s equation.

v = ∇θ

The gradient of (8) gives (2), with help of (3) and (7).

Problem 1 In the free Schr¨odinger equation for a unit-mass particle, i¯h ∂ψ
2 ∇2ψ, set
ψ = ρ1/2eiθ/¯h, and separate real and imaginary parts. Show that the resulting equations are
like those of ﬂuid mechanics. What is the velocity? Is vorticity supported? What is the
force f ?

∂t = − ¯h2

Our equations can be presented in any dimensionality, but we shall mostly consider the
cases of three, two, and one spatial dimensions. In the ﬁrst case, the vorticity is a (pseudo-)
vector

in the second, it is a (pseudo-)scalar

ω = ∇ × v

ω = εij∂ivj

(9)

(10)

while the last, lineal case is always simple because there is no vorticity and the velocity can
always be written as the derivative (with respect to the single spatial variable) of a potential.

Dynamics of any particular system is most economically presented when a canonical/action
formulation is available. To this end we note that the above equations of motion can be
obtained by (Poisson) bracketing with the Hamiltonian

H =Z dr(cid:0) 1

{vi(r), vj (r′)} = −

ωij(r)
ρ(r)

δ(r − r′).

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(The ﬁelds in curly brackets are at equal times, hence the time argument is suppressed.) An
equivalent, more transparent version of the algebra (14) is satisﬁed by the ﬁeld momentum
density,

As a consequence of (14) we have

P = ρv .

{P i(r), ρ(r′)} = ρ(r)∂iδ(r − r′)
{P i(r),P j (r′)} = P j(r)∂iδ(r − r′) + P i(r′)∂j δ(r − r′).

(15)

(16)

This is the familiar algebra of momentum densities. One veriﬁes that the Jacobi identity is
satisﬁed [4].

Naturally one asks whether there exists a Lagrangian whose canonical variables lead to the
Poisson brackets (14) or (16) and to the Hamiltonian (11). In more mathematical language,
we seek a canonical 1-form and a symplectic 2-form that lead to the algebra (14) or (16).

Problem 2 Second-quantized Schr¨odinger ﬁelds satisfy equal-time commutation (anticom-
mutation) relations, when describing bosons (fermions): ⌈ψ(r), ψ∗(r′)⌋± = δ(r − r′). Show
that the algebra (16) is reproduced (apart from factors of i¯h) when ρ = ψ∗ψ, P = Im ¯hψ∗∇ψ.
Since in the nonrelativistic theory P = j, ﬁnd j in terms of ρ and v, with v as determined in
Problem 1.

2.2 A word on canonical formulations

I shall now describe an approach to canonical formulations of dynamics, publicized by Faddeev
and me [5], which circumvents and simpliﬁes the more elaborate approach of Dirac.

12

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

We begin with a Lagrangian that is ﬁrst order in time. This entails no loss of generality
because all second-order Lagrangians can be converted to ﬁrst order by the familiar Legendre
transformation, which produces a Hamiltonian: H(p, q) = p ˙q − L( ˙q, q), where p ≡ ∂L/∂ ˙q
(the over-dot designates the time derivative). The equations of motion gotten by taking
the Euler-Lagrange derivative with respect to p and q of the Lagrangian L( ˙p, p; ˙q, q) ≡ p ˙q −
H(p, q) coincide with the “usual” equations of motion obtained by taking the q Euler-Lagrange
derivative of L( ˙q, q). [In fact L( ˙p, p; ˙q, q) does not depend on ˙p.] Moreover, some Lagrangians
possess only a ﬁrst-order formulation (for example, Lagrangians for the Schr¨odinger or Dirac
ﬁelds; also the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian in light-cone coordinates is ﬁrst order in the light-cone
“time” derivative).

Denoting all variables by the generic symbol ξi, the most general ﬁrst-order Lagrangian is

L = ai(ξ) ˙ξi − H(ξ).

(17)

Note that although we shall ultimately be interested in ﬁelds deﬁned on space-time, for present
didactic purposes it suﬃces to consider variables ξi(t) that are functions only of time. The
Euler-Lagrange equation that is implied by (17) reads

where

fij(ξ) ˙ξj =

∂H(ξ)

∂ξi

fij(ξ) =

∂aj(ξ)
∂ξi −

∂ai(ξ)

∂ξj

.

(18)

(19)

The ﬁrst term in (17) determines the canonical 1-form: ai(ξ) ˙ξi dt = ai(ξ) dξi, while fij gives
the symplectic 2-form: dai(ξ) dξi = 1

2 fij(ξ) dξi dξj.

To set up a canonical formalism, we proceed directly. We do not make the frequently
heard statement that “the canonical momenta ∂L/∂ ˙ξi = ai(ξ) are constrained to depend on
the coordinates ξ”, and we do not embark on Dirac’s method for constrained systems.

In fact, if the matrix fij possesses the inverse f ij there are no constraints. Then (18)

implies

When one wants to express this equation of motion by bracketing with the Hamiltonian

˙ξi = f ij(ξ)

∂H(ξ)

∂ξj

.

˙ξi = {H(ξ), ξi} = {ξj, ξi}

∂H(ξ)

∂ξj

one is directly led to postulating the fundamental bracket as

The Poisson bracket between functions of ξ is then deﬁned by

{ξi, ξj} = −f ij(ξ).

{F1(ξ), F2(ξ)} = −

∂F1(ξ)

∂ξi f ij ∂F2(ξ)

∂ξj

.

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

13

One veriﬁes that (22) satisﬁes Jacobi identity by virtue of (19).

When fij is singular and has no inverse, constraints do arise, and the development becomes

more complicated (see [5]).

Our problem in connection with (14) and (16) is in fact the inverse of what I have here
summarized. From (14) and (16), we know the form of f ij and that the Jacobi identity
holds. We then wish to determine the inverse fij, and also ai from (19). Since we know the
Hamiltonian from (11), construction of the Lagrangian (17) should follow immediately.

However, an obstacle may arise: If there exists a quantity C(ξ) whose Poisson bracket with

all the ξi vanishes, then

0 = {ξi, C(ξ)} = −f ij ∂
That is, f ij has the zero mode ∂
∂ξj C(ξ), and the inverse to f ij, namely the symplectic 2-form
fij, does not exist. In that case, something more has to be done, and we shall come back to
this problem.

∂ξj C(ξ) .

(24)

Totally commuting quantities like C(ξ) are called “Casimir invariants”. Since they Poisson-
commute with all the dynamical variables, they commute with the Hamiltonian, and are
constants of motion. But these constants do not reﬂect any symmetry of the speciﬁc Hamilto-
nian, nor do they generate any inﬁnitesimal transformation on ξi, since the {C(ξ), ξi} bracket
vanishes.

As will be demonstrated below, the algebra (14), (16) admits Casimir invariants, which
create an obstruction to the construction of a canonical formalism for ﬂuid mechanics; this
obstruction must be overcome to make progress.
(In the Lagrangian formulation of ﬂuid
mechanics these Casimirs are related to a parameterization-invariance of that formalism [3].)

2.3 The irrotational case

We now return to the speciﬁc issue of determining the ﬂuid dynamical Lagrangian. The
problem of constructing a Lagrangian which leads to (14) and (16) can be solved by inspection
for the irrotational case, with vanishing vorticity [see (6)]. For then the velocity commutator
in (14) vanishes and (7) shows that the ﬁrst equation in (14) can be satisﬁed by taking ρ and
θ to be canonically conjugate.

Thus the Lagrangian reads

{θ(r), ρ(r′)} = δ(r − r′)

Lirrotational =Z dr(cid:0)θ ˙ρ − Hv=∇θ(cid:1)

where H is given by (11) with v taken as in (7). The form of this Lagrangian can be understood
by the following argument, due to C. Eckart [6].

In a continuum description, the particle-counting index n becomes the continuous variable r,

But we also need to link the density with the current j = ρv, so that the continuity equation
holds. This can be enforced with the help of a Lagrange multiplier θ. We thus arrive at the
free, continuum Lagrangian.

kinetic energy, that is, the momentum p, which in this nonrelativistic setting coincides with v.

Remarkably, the same equation (33) emerges for a kinetic energy T (v) that is an arbitrary
function of v. This will be useful for us when we study a relativistic generalization of the
theory. If we replace (28) by

and vary v to eliminate it, we get in a generalization of (30)

∇θ =

∂v ≡ p.

(34)

(35)

So in the general case, it is the momentum – the v derivative of T (v) – that is irrotational.
The Lagrange density becomes

where h(p) is the Legendre transform of T (v).

(as long as ∂pi/∂vk = ∂2T /∂vi∂vk has an inverse).

Let me observe that free motion is here governed by a Lagrangian that is not quadratic
and the free equations are not linear. Nevertheless, the equations of motion (38) and (42) can
be solved in terms of initial data.

ρ(t = 0, r) ≡ ρ0(r)
v(t = 0, r) ≡ v0(r)

Upon determining the retarded position q(t, r) from the equation

one veriﬁes that the solution to the free equations reads

q + tv0(q) = r

v(t, r) = v0(q)

A ﬁnal remark: Note that the free Bernoulli equation (8) coincides with the free Hamilton-

Jacobi equation for the action.

2.4 Nonvanishing vorticity and the Clebsch parameterization

We now return to our original Galileo-invariant problem and enquire about the Lagrangian
for velocity ﬁelds that are not irrotational, that is, whose vorticity is nonvanishing. Here we
specify the spatial dimensionality to be 3, and observe that the algebra (14) possesses a zero
mode, since the quantity

C(v) ≡Z dr εijkvi∂jvk =Z dr v · ω

(48)

(Poisson) commutes with both ρ and v. So the symplectic 2-form does not exist:
in the
language developed above, f ij has no inverse. (Notice that C, also called the “ﬂuid helic-
ity”, coincides with the Abelian Chern-Simons term for v [7].) (In the irrotational case with
vanishing ω, the obstacle obviously is absent.)

To make progress, one must neuteralize the obstruction. This is achieved in the following

manner, as was shown by C.C. Lin [8].

We use the Clebsch parameterization for the vector ﬁeld v. Any three-dimensional vector,

which involves three functions, can be presented as

v = ∇θ + α∇β

(49)

with three suitably chosen scalar functions θ, α, and β. This is called the “Clebsch parameteri-
zation”, and (α, β) are called “Gaussian potentials” [9]. In this parameterization, the vorticity
reads

ω = ∇α × ∇β

(50)

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

17

and the Lagrangian is taken as

L = −Z dr ρ( ˙θ + α ˙β) − Hv=∇θ+α∇β

(51)

with v in H expressed as in (49). Thus (ρ, θ) remain canonically conjugate but another
canonical pair appears: (ρα, β). The phase space is 4-dimensional, corresponding to the four
observables ρ and v, and a straightforward calculation shows that the Poisson brackets (14)
are reproduced, with v constructed by (49).

But how has the obstacle been overcome? Let us observe that in the Clebsch parameteri-

zation C is given by

which is just a surface integral

C =Z dr εijk ∂iθ ∂jα ∂kβ

C =Z dS ·(θω).

(52)

(53)

In this form, C has no bulk contribution, and presents no obstacle to constructing a symplectic
2-form and a canonical 1-form in terms of θ, α and β, which are deﬁned in the bulk, that is,
for all ﬁnite r.

Lin gave an Eckart-type derivation of (51): Return to ¯LGalileo

2 ρv2 + θ(cid:0) ˙ρ + ∇ · (ρv)(cid:1) − ρα( ˙β + v · ∇β)(cid:17)

(54)

Setting the variation (with respect to v) to zero evaluates v as in (49); eliminating v from (54)
gives rise to (51).

This procedure works in any number of dimensions, producing the same canonical 1-form
in any dimension. This means that in two spatial dimensions, on the plane, where the (ρ, v)
space is three-dimensional, the four-dimensional phase space (ρ, θ; ρα, β) is larger. Moreover,
the analog to C in two spatial dimensions, that is, the obstruction to constructing a symplectic
2-form, is not a single quantity: an inﬁnite number of objects (Poisson) commute with ρ and v.
These are

Cn =Z dr ρ(cid:16) ω
ρ(cid:17)n

n = 0,±1,±2, . . . .

(55)

(Of course, the Cn vanish in the irrotational case where there is no obstruction.) One can
understand why there is an inﬁnite number of obstructions by observing that phase space
must be even dimensional, but (ρ, v) comprise three quantities on the plane. So a nonsingular
symplectic form can be constructed either by increasing the number of canonical variables to
four, or decreasing to two. The Lin/Clebsch method increases the variables. On the other
hand, decreasing to two entails suppressing of one continuous and local degree of freedom, and

18

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

evidently this is equivalent to neutralizing the inﬁnite number of global obstructions, namely,
the Cn. But I do not know how to eﬀect such a suppression, so I remain with (51).

Note that ¯LGalileo

in (54), apart from a total time derivative, can also be written in any

number of dimensions as

¯LGalileo

=Z dr(cid:0)ρT (v) − ρ( ˙θ + α ˙β) − ρv · (∇θ + α∇β)(cid:1)
=Z dr(cid:0)ρT (v) − jµ(∂µθ + α∂µβ)(cid:1)

where we have introduced the current four-vector

jµ = (cρ, ρv),

(56)

(57)

employed the four-vector gradient ∂µ = ( 1
∂
∂t , ∇), and denoted the kinetic energy by T (v).
c
These expressions will form our starting point for a relativistic generalization of the theory as
well as a non-Abelian generalization. (That is why we have introduced the velocity of light in
the above deﬁnitions; of course c disappears in the Galilean theory, as it has no role there.)

Finally we observed that in one spatial dimension, where v can always be written as θ′

and the vorticity vanishes, the irrotational canonical 1-form R dx θ ˙ρ is generally applicable
and can equivalently be written as − 1
2R dx dy ρ(x)ε(x− y) ˙v(y), where ε is a ±1-step function,
determined by the sign of its argument. Evidently this leads to a spatially nonlocal, but
otherwise completely satisfactory canonical formulation of ﬂuid motion on a line.

2.5 Some further remarks on the Clebsch parameterization

Let me elaborate on the Clebsch parameterization for a vector ﬁeld, which was presented for
the velocity vector in (49). Here I shall use the notation of electromagnetism and discuss
the Clebsch parameterization of a vector potential A, which also leads to the magnetic ﬁeld
B = ∇×A. (Of course the same observations apply when the vector in question is the velocity
ﬁeld v, with ∇ × v giving the vorticity.)

The familiar parameterization of a three-component vector employs a scalar function θ (the
“gauge” or “longitudinal” part) and a two-component transverse vector AT : A = ∇θ + AT ,
∇ · AT = 0. This decomposition is unique and invertible (on a space with simple topology).
In contrast, the Clebsch parameterization uses three scalar functions, θ, α, and β,

A = ∇θ + α∇β

(58)

which are not uniquely determined by A (see below). The associated magnetic ﬁeld reads

Repeating the above in form notation, the 1-form A = Ai dri is presented as

B = ∇α × ∇β.

A = dθ +α dβ

(59)

(60)

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

19

and the 2-form is

dA = dα dβ .

(61)

Darboux’s theorem ensures that the Clebsch parameterization is attainable locally in space
[in the form (60)] [10]. Additionally, an explicit construction of α, β, and θ can be given by
the following [11].

Solve the equations

(62a)

(62b)

Solutions of these relations deﬁne two surfaces, called “magnetic surfaces”, that are given by
equations of the form

Sn(r) = constant

(n = 1, 2).

It follows from (62) that these also satisfy

B · ∇Sn = 0

(n = 1, 2)

(63)

(64)

that is, the normals to Sn are orthogonal to B, or B is parallel to the tangent of Sn. The
intersection of the two surfaces forms the so-called “magnetic lines”, that is, loci that solve
the dynamical system

dr(τ )

dτ

= B(cid:0)r(τ )(cid:1)

(65)

where τ is an evolution parameter. Finally, the Gaussian potentials α and β are constructed
as functions of r only through a dependence on the magnetic surfaces,

so that

α(r) = α(cid:0)Sn(r)(cid:1)
β(r) = β(cid:0)Sn(r)(cid:1)

∇α × ∇β = (∇S1 × ∇S2)εmn ∂α

∂Sm

∂β
∂Sn

.

(66)

(67)

Evidently as a consequence of (64), ∇α × ∇β in (67) is parallel to B, and because B is
divergence-free α and β can be adjusted so that the norm of ∇α × ∇β coincides with |B|.
Once α and β have been ﬁxed in this way, θ can easily be computed from A − α∇β.

Neither the individual magnetic surfaces nor the Gauss potentials are unique. [By viewing
A as a canonical 1-form, it is clear that the expression (60) retains its form after a canonical

20

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

transformation of α, β.] One may therefore require that the Gaussian potentials α and β
simply coincide with the two magnetic surfaces: α = S1, β = S2. Nevertheless, for a given A
and B it may not be possible to solve (62) explicitly.

The Chern-Simons integrand A · B becomes in the Clebsch parameterization

A · B = ∇θ · (∇α × ∇β) = ∇ · (θB) = B · ∇θ.

(68)

Thus having identiﬁed the Gauss potentials α and β with the two magnetic surfaces, we deduce
from (64) and (68) three equations for the three functions (θ, α, β) that comprise the Clebsch
parameterization.

B · ∇α = B · ∇β = 0
B · ∇θ = Chern-Simons density A · B

(69)

Eq. (68) also shows that in the Clebsch parameterization the Chern-Simons density becomes

a total derivative.

A · B = ∇ · (θB)

(70)

This does not mean that the Clebsch parameterization is unavailable when the Chern-Simons
integral over all space is nonzero. Rather for a nonvanishing integral and well-behaved B
ﬁeld, one must conclude that the Clebsch function θ is singular either in the ﬁnite volume of
the integration region or on the surface at inﬁnity bounding the integration domain. Then
the Chern-Simons volume integral over (Ω) becomes a surface integral on the surfaces (∂Ω)
bounding the singularities.

ZΩ

dr A · B =Z∂Ω

dS · (θB)

(71)

Eq. (71) shows that the Chern-Simons integral measures the magnetic ﬂux, modulated by θ
and passing through the surfaces that surround the singularities of θ.

The following explicit example illustrates the above points.

half-integer). The corresponding magnetic ﬁeld reads

and the Chern-Simons integral – also called the “magnetic helicity” in the electrodynamical
context – is quantized (in multiples of 16π2) by the behavior of a(r) at inﬁnity

Chern-Simons density over all space. This integral may ﬁrst be evaluated over a spherical ball

h(0)(cid:3), but various singularities must be carefully handled.

Problem 5 Show that R d3r B · δA vanishes (apart from surface terms) where δA is a
variation and A, B = ∇ × A, as well as δA are presented in the Clebsch parameterization.
When the variational principle is implemented by varying the components of A, one ﬁnds
that 1
2R d3r B2 is stationary provided ∇ × B = 0. Show that implementing the variation by
varying the scalar functions in the Clebsch parameterization for A gives the weaker condition
∇ × B = µB, where µ can depend on r. How is this r-dependence constrained? How is the
constraint satisﬁed?

There is another approach to the construction of (Abelian) vector potentials for which the
(Abelian) Chern-Simons density is a total derivative, and as a consequence a Clebsch parame-
terization for these potentials is readily found. The method relies on projecting an Abelian
potential from a non-Abelian one, and it can be generalized to a construction of non-Abelian
vectors for which the non-Abelian Chern-Simons density is again a total derivative. This will
be useful for us when we come to discuss non-Abelian ﬂuid mechanics. Therefore, I shall now
explain this method – in its Abelian realization [12].

We consider an SU(2) group element g and a pure gauge SU(2) gauge ﬁeld, whose matrix-

valued 1-form is

where σa are Pauli matrices. It is known that

g−1 dg = V a σa
2i

tr(g−1 dg)3 = − 1

4 εabcV aV bV c = − 3

2 V 1V 2V 3

(79)

(80)

is a total derivative; indeed its spatial integral measures the winding number of the gauge
function g [13]. Since V a is a pure gauge, we have

dV a = − 1

2 εabcV bV c

(81)

so that if we deﬁne an Abelian gauge potential A by projecting one SU(2) component of (79)
(say the third) A = V 3, the Abelian Chern-Simons density for A is a total derivative, as is
seen from the chain of equation that relies on (80) and (81).

A dA = V 3 dV 3 = −V 1V 2V 3 = 2

3 tr(g−1 dg)3

(82)

Of course A = V 3 is not an Abelian pure gauge.

Note that g depends on three arbitrary functions, the three SU(2) local gauge functions.
Hence V 3 enjoys suﬃcient generality to represent the 3-dimensional vector A. Moreover,
since A’s Abelian Chern-Simons density is given by tr(g−1 dg)3, which is a total derivative, a
Clebsch parameterization for A is easily constructed. We also observe that when the SU(2)
group element g has nonvanishing winding number, the resultant Abelian vector possesses a
nonvanishing Chern-Simons integral, that is, nonzero magnetic helicity.

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

23

Finally we remark that the example of a Clebsch-parameterized gauge potential A, pre-
sented above in (72), is gotten by a projection onto the third isospin direction of a pure gauge

SU(2) potential, constructed from group element g = exp(cid:0)(σa/2i)ˆraa(r)(cid:1) [12].

Further intricacies arise when the Clebsch parameterization is used in variational calcula-

tions involving vector ﬁelds; see Ref. [14].

3 Speciﬁc Models

We now return to our irrotational models both relativistic and nonrelativistic, for which we
shall specify an explicit force law and discuss further properties.

3.1 Galileo-invariant nonrelativistic model

Recall that the nonrelativistic Lagrangian for irrotational motion reads

(83)

(84)

LGalileo =Z dr(cid:16)θ ˙ρ − ρ

(∇θ)2

2 − V (ρ)(cid:17)

where ∇θ = v. The Hamiltonian density H is composed of the last two terms beyond the
canonical 1-form R dr θ ˙ρ,

(∇θ)2

H =Z dr(cid:16)ρ

2

+ V (ρ)(cid:17) =Z dr H.

Various expressions for V appear in the literature. V (ρ) ∝ ρn is a popular choice, appropriate
for the adiabatic equation of state. We shall be speciﬁcally interested in the “Chaplygin gas”.

V (ρ) =

λ
ρ

,

λ > 0

(85)

According to what we said before, the Chaplygin gas has enthalpy V ′ = −λ/ρ2, negative
pressure P = −2λ/ρ, and speed of sound s = √2λ/ρ (hence λ > 0).

Chaplygin introduced his equation of state as a mathematical approximation to the physi-
cally relevant adiabatic expressions with n > 0. (Constants are arranged so that the Chaplygin
formula is tangent at one point to the adiabatic proﬁle [15].) Also it was realized that certain
deformable solids can be described by the Chaplygin equation of state [16]. These days nega-
tive pressure is recognized as a possible physical eﬀect: exchange forces in atoms give rise to
negative pressure; stripe states in the quantum Hall eﬀect may be a consequence of negative
pressure; the recently discovered cosmological constant may be exerting negative pressure on
the cosmos, thereby accelerating expansion.

For any form of V , the model possesses the Galileo symmetry appropriate to nonrelativistic
dynamics. The Galileo transformations comprise the time and space translations, as well as
space rotations. The corresponding constants of motion are the energy E.

(88)

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

25

The action of these transformations on the ﬁelds is straightforward: the time and space argu-
ments are shifted or the space argument is rotated. Slightly less trivial is the action of Galileo
boosts, which boost the spatial coordinate by a velocity u

r → R = r − tu.

The density ﬁeld transforms trivially: its spatial argument is boosted,

ρ(t, r) → ρu(t, r) = ρ(t, R)
but the velocity potential acquires an inhomogeneous term.

θ(t, r) → θu(t, r) = θ(t, R) + u · r −

u2
2

t

(89)

(90)

(91)

Those of you familiar with ﬁeld theoretic realizations of the Galileo group will recognize the
inhomogeneous term as the well-known Galileo 1-cocyle.
It ensures that the velocity, the
gradient of θ, transforms appropriately.

The associated conserved quantity is the “boost generator”.

v(t, r) → vu(t, r) = v(t, r − tu) + u

B = tP −Z dr ρr

(Galileo boost)

Finally, also conserved is the total number.

N =Z dr ρ

(particle number)

(92)

(93)

(94)

The corresponding transformation shifts θ by a constant.

These transformations and constants of motion ﬁt into the general theory: the action is
invariant against the transformations; Noether’s theorem can be used to derive the constants
of motion; their time independence is veriﬁed with the help of the equations of motion –
indeed, the continuity equations (1), (4), and (5) as well as the symmetry of T ij guarantee
this. Also, using the basic Poisson brackets (25) for the (ρ, θ) variables, one can check that each
inﬁnitesimal transformation is generated by Poisson bracketing with the appropriate constant;
Poisson bracketing the constants with each other reproduces the Galileo Lie algebra with a
central extension given by N , which corresponds to the familiar Galileo 2-cocycle. There are
a total of 1
2 (d + 1)(d + 2) Galileo generators in d space plus one time dimensions. Together
with the central term, we have a total of 1

2 (d + 1)(d + 2) + 1 generators.

Another useful consequence of the symmetry transformations is that they map solutions of
the equations of motion into new solutions. Of course, “new” solutions produced by Galileo
transformations are trivially related to the old ones: they are simply shifted, boosted or rotated.
[The free theory as well as the adiabatic theory with n = 1 + 2/d are also invariant
against the SO(2,1) group of time translation, dilation, and conformal transformation [17],

26

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

which together with the Galileo group form the “Schr¨odinger group” of nonrelativistic motion,
whenever the energy-momentum “tensor” satisﬁes 2T oo = T i

i [18].]

But we shall now turn to the speciﬁc Chaplygin gas model, with V (ρ) = λ/ρ, which

possesses additional and unexpected symmetries.

The Chaplygin gas action and consequent Bernoulli equation for the Chaplygin gas in (d, 1)

space-time read

(95)

(96)

This model possesses further space-time symmetries beyond those of the Galileo group [19].
First of all, there is a one-parameter (ω) time rescaling transformation

under which the ﬁelds transform as

t → T = eωt,

θ(t, r) → θω(t, r) = eωθ(T, r)
ρ(t, r) → ρω(t, r) = e−ωρ(T, r).

(97)

(98)

(99)

Second, in d spatial dimensions, there is a vectorial, d-parameter (ω) space-time mixing trans-
formation

t → T (t, r) = t + ω · r + 1
r → R(t, r) = r + ω θ(T, R)

2 ω2θ(T, R)

(100)

(101)

Note that the transformation law for the coordinates involves the θ ﬁeld itself. Under this
transformation, the ﬁelds transform according to

θ(t, r) → θω(t, r) = θ(T, R)
ρ(t, r) → ρω(t, r) = ρ(T, R)

˙θ(T, R)(cid:17)−1

(The time and space derivatives in the last element are with respect to t and r.) One can again
tell the complete story for these transformations: The action is invariant; Noether’s theorem
gives the conserved quantities, which for the time rescaling is

D = tH −Z dr ρθ

(time rescaling)

(105)

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

27

while for the space-time mixing one ﬁnds

G =Z dr (rH − θP)

(space-time mixing).

(106)

The time independence of D and G can be veriﬁed with the help of the equations of motion
(continuity and Bernoulli). Poisson bracketing the ﬁelds θ and ρ with D and G generates the
appropriate inﬁnitesimal transformation on the ﬁelds.

So now the total number of generators is the sum of the previous 1

2 (d + 1)(d + 2) + 1 with

1 + d additional ones

1

2 (d + 1)(d + 2) + 1 + 1 + d = 1

2 (d + 2)(d + 3).

(107)

When one computes the Poisson brackets of all these with each other one ﬁnds the Poincar´e
Lie algebra in one higher spatial dimension, that is, in (d + 1, 1)-dimensional space-time, where
the Poincar´e group possesses 1
2 (d+2)(d+3) generators [20]. Moreover, one veriﬁes that (t, θ, r)
transform linearly as a (d + 2) Lorentz vector in light-cone components, with t being the “+”
component and θ the “−” component [21].

Presently, we shall use these additional symmetries to generate new solutions from old ones,
but, in contrast with what we saw earlier, the new solutions will be nontrivially linked to the
former ones. Note that the additional symmetry holds even in the free theory.

Before proceeding, let us observe that ρ may be eliminated by using the Bernoulli equation
to express it in terms of θ. In this way, one is led to the following ρ-independent action for θ
in the Chaplygin gas problem:

λ merely serves as an overall factor in the action.

The action (108) looks unfamiliar; yet it is Galileo invariant. [The combination ˙θ + 1

responds to Galileo transformations without a 1-cocycle; see (91).] Also I Chaplygin
possesses
the additional symmetries described above, with θ transforming according to the previously
recorded equations.

Galileo transforms generalize this in an obvious manner into a set of solutions. (The charge
density ρ is determined by its initial condition. In the free theory, ρ is an independent quantity,
and I shall not discuss it here.) Performing on the above formula for θ the new transformations
of time-rescaling and space-time mixing, we ﬁnd that the solution is invariant.

We can ﬁnd a solution similar to (110) in the interacting case, for d > 1, which we henceforth

assume (the d = 1 case will be separately discussed later). One veriﬁes that a solution is

θ(t, r) = −

exceeds v. Again this solution can be translated, rotated, and boosted. Moreover, the solution
is time-rescaling–invariant. However, the space-time mixing transformation produces a wholly
diﬀerent kind of solution. This is best shown graphically, where the d = 2 case is exhibited
(see ﬁgure) [22].

Another interesting solution, which is essentially one-dimensional (lineal), even though it

exists in arbitrary spatial dimension, is given by

θ(t, r) = Θ(ˆn · r) + u · r − 1

2 t(cid:0)u2 − (ˆn · u)2(cid:1).

Here ˆn is a spatial unit vector, u is an arbitrary vector with dimension of velocity, while Θ is an
arbitrary function with static argument, which can be boosted by the Galileo transform (91).
The corresponding charge density is time-independent.

The sound speed s = √2λ/ρ = Θ′(ˆn · r) + ˆn · u is just the ˆn component of the velocity
v = ∇θ = ˆnΘ′(ˆn · r) + u.

Finally, we record a planar static solution to (109)

where ˆn1 and ˆn2 are two orthogonal unit vectors [23].

θ(r) = Θ(ˆn1 · r/ˆn2 · r)

(118)

Problem 6 Show that the solution for θ given in (110) is invariant under the time rescaling
transformation (97), (98), and under the space-time mixing transformation (100)–(102).

3.2 Lorentz-invariant relativistic model

We now turn to a Lorentz-invariant generalization of our Galileo-invariant Chaplygin model
in (d, 1)-dimensional space-time. We already know from (34)–(37) how to construct the free
Lagrangian by using Eckart’s method with a relativistic kinetic energy.

T (v) = −c2p1 − v2/c2

p =

∂T (v)

∂v

=

v

p1 − v2/c2

Recall that mass has been scaled to unity, and that we retain the velocity of light c to keep
track of the nonrelativistic c → ∞ limit. Evidently, the momentum is

.

(120)

Thus the free relativistic Lagrangian, with current conservation enforced by the Lagrange
multiplier θ, reads [compare (34)]

¯LLorentz

0

=Z dr(cid:16)−c2ρp1 − v2/c2 + θ(cid:0) ˙ρ + ∇ · (ρv)(cid:1)(cid:17).

This may be presented in a Lorentz-covariant form in terms of a current four-vector jµ =
(cρ, ρv). ¯LLorentz

of equation (121) is thus equivalent to [compare (56), (57)]

0

(119)

(121)

Eliminating v in (121), we ﬁnd, as before, that

¯LLorentz

0

=Z dr(cid:16)−jµ∂µθ − cpjµjµ(cid:17).

p =

∂T
∂v

=

v

√1 − v2/c2

= ∇θ,

v =

∇θ

and the free Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian reads [compare (36), (37)]

(122)

,

(123)

(124)

LLorentz

=Z dr(cid:16)θ ˙ρ − ρc2p1 + (∇θ)2/c2(cid:17).

To ﬁnd LGalileo

of (31) as the nonrelativistic limit of LLorentz

in (124), a nonrelativistic θ
variable must be extracted from its relativistic counterpart. Calling the former θNR and the
latter, which occurs in (124), θR, we deﬁne

0

θR ≡ −c2t + θNR.
It then follows that apart from a total time derivative

(125)

(126)

Next, one wants to include interactions. While there are many ways to allow for Lorentz-
invariant interactions, we seek an expression that reduces to the Chaplygin gas in the nonrel-
ativistic limit. Thus, we choose [24]

LBorn-Infeld

a

=Z dr(cid:16)θ ˙ρ −pρ2c2 + a2pc2 + (∇θ)2(cid:17) ,

(127)

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

31

where a is the interaction strength. [The reason for the nomenclature will emerge presently.]
We see that, as c → ∞,

LBorn-Infeld

a

−−−−→c→∞

LChaplygin

λ=a2/2

.

(128)

[Again θNR is extracted from θR as in (125) and a total time derivative is ignored.] Although
it perhaps is not obvious, (127) deﬁnes a Poincar´e-invariant theory, and this will be explicitly
demonstrated below. Therefore, LBorn-Infeld
possesses Lorentz and Poincar´e symmetries in
(d, 1) space-time, with a total of 1
2 (d + 1)(d + 2) + 1 generators, where the last “ + 1” refers to

a

the total number N =R dr ρ.

When a = 0, the model is free and elementary. It was demonstrated previously [eqs. (34)–
(42)] that the free equations of motion are precisely the same as in the nonrelativistic free
model, so the complete solution (43)–(47) works here as well. For a 6= 0, in the presence of
interactions, one can eliminate ρ as before, and one is left with a Lagrangian just for the θ
ﬁeld. It reads

LBorn-Infeld

a

= −aZ drqc2 − (∂µθ)2.

This is a Born-Infeld-type theory for a scalar ﬁeld θ; its Poincar´e invariance is manifest, and
again, the elimination of ρ is only possible with nonvanishing a, which however disappears
from the dynamics, serving merely to normalize the Lagrangian.

(129)

(130)

(131)

(132)

The equations of motion that follow from (127) read

c2 + (∇θ)2 ! = 0

˙ρ + ∇ · ∇θs ρ2c2 + a2
˙θ + ρc2s c2 + (∇θ)2

ρ2c2 + a2 = 0 .

The density ρ can be evaluated in terms of θ from (131); then (130) reads

∂α(cid:16)

1

pc2 − (∂µθ)2

∂αθ(cid:17) = 0

which also follows from (129). After θNR is extracted from θR as in (125) we see that in the
nonrelativistic limit LBorn-Infeld

(127) or (129) becomes LChaplygin

of (95) or (108),

a

λ

LBorn-Infeld

a

−−−−→c→∞

LChaplygin

λ=a2/2

(133)

and the equations of motion (130)–(132) reduce to (1), (96), and (109).

In view of all the similarities to the nonrelativistic Chaplygin gas, it comes as no surprise
that the relativistic Born-Infeld theory possesses additional symmetries. These additional
symmetry transformations, which leave (127) or (129) invariant, involve a one-parameter (ω)
reparameterization of time, and a d-parameter (ω) vectorial reparameterization of space. Both
transformations are ﬁeld dependent.

32

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

The time transformation is given by an implicit formula involving also the ﬁeld θ [25],

t → T (t, r) =
while the ﬁeld transforms according to

t

cosh c2ω

θ(T, r)

c2

tanh c2ω

θ(t, r) → θω(t, r) =

θ(T, r)
cosh c2ω − c2t tanh c2ω .

(134)

(135)

[We record here only the transformation on θ; how ρ transforms can be determined from the
(relativistic) Bernoulli equation, obtained by varying ρ in (127), which expresses ρ in terms
of θ. Moreover, (135) is suﬃcient for discussing the invariance of (129).] The inﬁnitesimal
generator, which is time independent by virtue of the equations of motion, is [26]

D =Z dr(cid:16)c4tρ + θpρ2c2 + a2pc2 + (∇θ)2(cid:17)
=Z dr(c4tρ + θH)

(time reparameterization).

(136)

A second class of transformations involving a reparameterization of the spatial variables is

implicitly deﬁned by [25].

r → R(t, r) = r − ˆωθ(t, R)

tan cω

c

+ ˆω(ˆω · r)(cid:18) 1 − cos cω

θ(t, r) → θω(t, r) =

θ(t, R) − c(ˆω · r) sin cω

cos cω

(137)

(138)

ˆω is the unit vector ω/ω and ω = √ω · ω. The time-independent generator of the inﬁnitesimal

transformation reads [26]

G =Z dr(c2rρ + θρ∇θ)
=Z dr(c2rρ + θP)

(space reparameterization).

(139)

Of course the Born-Infeld action (127) or (129) is invariant against these transformations,
whose inﬁnitesimal form is generated by the constants.

With the addition of D and G to the previous generators, the Poincar´e algebra in (d + 1, 1)
dimension is reconstructed, and (t, r, θ) transforms linearly as a (d + 2)-dimensional Lorentz
vector (in Cartesian components) [21]. Note that this symmetry also holds in the free, a = 0,
theory.

It is easy to exhibit solutions of the relativistic equation (132), which reduce to solutions of
the nonrelativistic, Chaplygin gas equation (109) [after −c2t has been removed, as in (125)].
For example

θ(t, r) = −crc2t2 +

solves (132) and reduces to (112). The relativistic analog of the lineal solution (115) is

θ(t, r) = Θ(ˆn · r) + n · r − ctpc2 + u2 − (ˆn · u)2.

(141)

[Note that the above proﬁles continue to solve (132), even when the sign of the square root is
reversed, but then they no longer possess a nonrelativistic limit.]

Additionally there exists an essentially relativistic solution, describing massless propaga-
tion in one direction: according to (132), θ can satisfy the wave equation ⊓⊔θ = 0, provided
(∂µθ)2 = constant, as for example with plane waves

where (∂µθ)2 vanishes. Then ρ reads, from (131),

θ(t, r) = f (ˆn · r ± ct)

ρ = ∓

Other solutions are given in ref. [27].

3.3 Some remarks on relativistic ﬂuid mechanics

The Born-Infeld model reduces in the nonrelativistic limit to the Chaplygin gas. Equations
governing the latter belong to ﬂuid mechanics, but the Born-Infeld equations do not readily
expose their ﬂuid mechanical structure. Nevertheless they do in fact describe a relativistic
ﬂuid. In order to demonstrate this, we give a pr´ecis of relativistic ﬂuid mechanics.

Usually the dynamics of a relativistic ﬂuid is presented in terms of the energy-momentum
tensor, θµν, and the equations of motion are just the conservation equations ∂µθµν = 0 [28].
[We denote the relativistic energy-momentum tensor by θµν, to distinguish it from the nonrel-
ativistic T µν introduced in (4) and (5). The limiting relation between the two is given below.]
But we prefer to begin with a Lagrange density

Here jµ is the current Lorentz vector jµ = (cρ, j). The aµ comprise a set of auxilliary variables;
in the relativistic analog of irrotational ﬂuids we take aµ = ∂µθ, more generally

L = −jµaµ − f (pjµjµ).

(144)

aµ = ∂µθ + α∂µβ

(145)

so that the Chern-Simons density of ai is a total derivative [compare (56), (57)]. The function f
depends on the Lorentz invariant jµjµ = c2ρ2−j2 and encodes the speciﬁc dyanamics (equation
of state).

The energy momentum tensor for L is

θµν = −gµνL +

jµjν√jαjα

f′(pjαjα).

(146)

34

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

[One way to derive (146) from (144) is to embed that expression in an external metric tensor
gµν , which is then varied; in the variation jµ and aµ are taken to be metric-independent and
jµ = gµν jν .] Furthermore, varying jµ in (144) shows that

so that (146) becomes

aµ = −

jµ√jαjα

f′(pjαjα)

θµν = −gµν [nf′(n) − f (n)] + uµuν nf′(n)

where we have introduced the proper velocity uµ by

jµ = nuµ

uµuµ = 1

(147)

(148)

(149)

so that n is proportional to the proper density and 1/n is proportional to the speciﬁc volume.
Eq. (148) identiﬁes the proper energy density e and the pressure P (which coincides with L)
through the conventional formula [28].

θµν = −gµν P + uµuv(P + e)

Therefore, in our case

e = f (n)
P = nf′(n) − f (n) .
The thermodynamic relation involving entropy S reads

P d(cid:16) 1

n(cid:17) + d(cid:16) e

n(cid:17) ∝ dS

L0 = −jµaµ − cpjµjµ.

(150)

(151)

(152)

(153)

(154)

where the proportionality constant is determined by the temperature. With (151) and (152)
the left side of (153) vanishes and we verify that entropy is constant, that is, we are dealing
with an isentropic system, as has been stated in the very beginning.

For the free system, the pressure vanishes, so we choose f (n) = cn

0

In the “irrotational” case, aµ = ∂µθ, and with j = ρv this Lagrange density produces the free
¯LLorentz

of (121), (122) (apart from a total time derivative).

For the Born-Infeld theory, we present the pressure P in (152) by choosing f (n) = c√a2+n2,

which corresponds to the pressure P = −a2c/√a2 + n2. When the current is written as

so that

the Lagrange density

L = P = −

a2c

√a2 + n2

(155c)

coincides with that for the Born-Infeld model in eq. (129).

Other forms for f give rise to relativistic ﬂuid mechanics with other equations of state.
It is interesting to see how the nonrelativistic limit of θµν in (148) produces T µν of (4)–(5).
It is especially intriguing to notice that θµν is symmetric but T µν is not. To make the connec-

conclude

tion we recall that uµ = 1/p1 − v2/c2(1, v/c), we observe that n =pρ2c2 − j2, set j = ρv and
ρcp1 − v2/c2 ∼ ρc − (ρv2/2c). Also f (n) is chosen to be cn + V (n/c), and thus P =
nf′(n) − f (n) = (n/c)V ′(n/c) − V (n/c). It follows that

that

1 − v2/c2 + V (ρ)

+ V (ρ) = ρc2 + T oo .

(156)

Thus, apart from the relativistic “rest energy” ρc2, θoo passes to T oo. The relativistic energy

1 − v2/c2

Again, apart from the O(c2) current, associated with the O(c2) rest energy in θoo, T jo is
obtained in the limit. The momentum density is θoi/c (because θµν has dimension of energy
density). Thus

From the limiting formula n ∼ ρc we also see that the pressure in (155c) tends to the

4 Common Ancestry: The Nambu-Goto Action

The “hidden” symmetries and the associated transformation laws for the Chaplygin and Born-
Infeld models may be given a coherent setting by considering the Nambu-Goto action for a
d-brane in (d + 1) spatial dimensions, moving on (d + 1, 1)-dimensional space-time.
In our
context, a d-brane is simply a d-dimensional extended object: a 1-brane is a string, a 2-brane
is a membrane and so on. A d-brane in (d + 1) space divides that space in two.

The Nambu-Goto action reads

ING =Z dϕ0 dϕLNG =Z dϕ0 dϕ1 ··· dϕd √G
G = (−1)d det

∂X µ
∂ϕα

∂Xµ
∂ϕβ

(160)

(161)

Here X µ is a (d + 1, 1) target space-time (d-brane) variable, with µ extending over the range
µ = 0, 1, . . . , d, d + 1. The ϕα are “world-volume” variables describing the extended object
with α ranging α = 0, 1, . . . , d; ϕα, α = 1, . . . , d, parameterizes the d-dimensional d-brane that
evolves in ϕ0.

The Nambu-Goto action is parameterization invariant, and we shall show that two diﬀerent
choices of parameterization (“light-cone” and “Cartesian”) lead to the Chaplygin gas and Born-
Infeld actions, respectively. For both parameterizations we choose (X 1, . . . , Xd) to coincide
with (ϕ1, . . . , ϕd), renaming them as r (a d-dimensional vector). This is usually called the
“static parameterization”. (The ability to carry out this parameterization globally presupposes
that the extended object is topologically trivial; in the contrary situation, singularities will
appear, which are spurious in the sense that they disappear in diﬀerent parameterizations, and
parameterization-invariant quantities are singularity-free.)

4.1 Light-cone parameterization

(X 0 ± X d+1). X + is renamed t and
For the light-cone parameterization we deﬁne X± as
identiﬁed with √2λ ϕ0. This completes the ﬁxing of the parameterization and the remaining
variable is X−, which is a function of ϕ0 and ϕ, or after redeﬁnitions, of t and r. X− is
renamed as θ(t, r) and then the Nambu-Goto action in this parameterization coincides with
the Chaplygin gas action I Chaplygin

in (108) [29].

1√2

λ

4.2 Cartesian parameterization

For the second, Cartesian parameterization X 0 is renamed ct and identiﬁed with cϕ0. The re-
maining target space variable X d+1, a function of ϕ0 and ϕ, equivalently of t and r, is renamed
,

θ(t, r)/c. Then the Nambu-Goto action reduces to the Born-Infeld action R dt LBorn-Infeld

(129) [29].

4.3 Hodographic transformation

There is another derivation of the Chaplygin gas from the Nambu-Goto action that makes use of
a hodographic transformation, in which independent and dependent variables are interchanged.
Although the derivation is more involved than the light-cone/static parameterization used in
Section 4.1 above, the hodographic approach is instructive in that it gives a natural deﬁnition
for the density ρ, which in the above static parameterization approach is determined from θ
by the Bernoulli equation (96).

1√2

We again use light-cone combinations:

(X 0 + X d+1) is called τ and is identiﬁed with
ϕ0, while 1√2
(X 0 − X d+1) is renamed θ. At this stage the dependent, target-space variables
are θ and the transverse coordinates X : X i, (i = 1, . . . , d), and all are functions of the world-
volume parameters ϕ0 = τ and ϕ : ϕr, (r = 1, . . . , d); ∂τ indicates diﬀerentiation with respect
∂Xµ
to τ = ϕ0, while ∂r denotes derivatives with respect to ϕr. The induced metric Gαβ = ∂X µ
∂ϕα
∂ϕβ
takes the form

Gαβ = Goo Gos

[That ur is still given by (165) is a consequence of (166a) and (167).] Here grs is inverse
to grs, and the two metrics are used to move the (r, s) indices. The theory still possesses
an invariance against redeﬁning the spatial parameters with a τ -dependent function of the
parameters; inﬁnitesimally: δϕr = −f r(τ, ϕ), δθ = f r∂rθ, δX i = f r∂rX i. This freedom may
be used to set ur to zero and Π to −1.

Next the hodographic transformation is performed: Rather than viewing the dependent
variables p, θ, and X as functions of τ and ϕ, X(τ, ϕ) is inverted so that ϕ becomes a
function of τ and X (renamed t and r, respectively), and p and θ also become functions of t
and r. It then follows from the chain rule that the constraint (167) (at Π = −1) becomes

and is solved by

0 =

∂X i

∂ϕr(cid:16)pi −

∂

∂X i θ(cid:17)

p = ∇θ .

(168)

(169)

Moreover, according to the chain rule and the implicit function theorem, the partial derivative
with respect to τ at ﬁxed ϕ [this derivative is present in (164)] is related to the partial derivative
with respect to τ at ﬁxed X = r by

∂τ =

∂
∂t

+ ∇θ · ∇

(170)

where we have used the new name “t” on the right. Thus the Nambu-Goto Lagrangian – the
ϕ integral of the Lagrange density (164) (at ur = 0, Π = −1) – reads
2 (p2 + g)(cid:9).
2√g(cid:9).

LNG =Z dϕ(cid:8)p · ∇θ − ˙θ − ∇θ · ∇θ − 1
LNG =Z dr(cid:8)−

The present derivation has the advantage of relating the density ρ to the Jacobian of

remark aimed at those who are acquainted with the Lagrange formulation of ﬂuid motion [3].)
Finally, let me observe that the expansion of the Galileo symmetry in (d, 1) space-time to
a Poincar´e symmetry in (d + 1, 1) space-time can be understood from a Kaluza-Klein–type
framework [30].

Interrelations

The relation to the Nambu-Goto action explains the origin of the hidden (d + 1, 1) Poincar´e
group in our two nonlinear models on (d, 1) space-time: Poincar´e invariance is what remains
of the reparameterization invariance of the Nambu-Goto action after choosing either the light-
cone or Cartesian parameterizations. Also the nonlinear, ﬁeld dependent form of the transfor-
mation laws leading to the additional symmetries is understood: it arises from the identiﬁcation
of some of the dependent variables (X µ) with the independent variables (ϕα).

The complete integrability of the d = 1 Chaplygin gas and Born-Infeld model is a con-
sequence of the fact that both descend from a string in 2-space; the associated Nambu-Goto
theory being completely integrable. We shall discuss this in Section 6.

We observe that in addition to the nonrelativistic descent from the Born-Infeld theory to
the Chaplygin gas, there exists a mapping of one system on another, and between solutions
of one system and the other, because both have the same d-brane ancestor. The mapping
is achieved by passing from the light-cone parameterization to the Cartesian, or vice-versa.
Speciﬁcally this is accomplished as follows:

Chaplygin gas → Born-Infeld: Given θN R(t, r), a nonrelativistic solution, determine
T (t, r) from the equation

The relation between the diﬀerent models is depicted in the ﬁgure below.
As a ﬁnal comment, I recall that the elimination of ρ, both in the nonrelativistic (Chap-
lygin) and relativistic (Born-Infeld) models is possible only in the presence of interactions.
Nevertheless, the θ-dependent (ρ-independent) resultant Lagrangians contain the interaction
strengths only as overall factors; see (108) and (129). It is these θ-dependent Lagrangians that
correspond to the Nambu-Goto action in various parameterizations. Let us further recall the
the Nambu-Goto action also carries an overall multiplicative factor: the d-brane “tension”,
which has been suppressed in (160). Correspondingly, for a “tensionless” d-brane, the Nambu-
Goto expression vanishes, and cannot generate dynamics. This suggests that an action for

“tensionless” d-branes could be the noninteracting ﬂuid mechanical expressions (95), (127),
with vanishing coupling strengths λ and a, respectively. Furthermore, we recall that the non-
interacting models retain the higher, dynamical symmetries, appropriate to a d-brane in one
higher dimension.

5 Supersymmetric Generalization

Once proven the fact that a bosonic Nambu-Goto theory gives rise to and links together the
Chaplygin gas and Born-Infeld models, which are irrotational in that the velocity of the former
and the momentum of the latter are given by a gradient of a potential, one can ask whether
there is a d-brane that produces a ﬂuid model with nonvanishing vorticity.

We shall show that this indeed can be achieved if one starts with a super–d-brane, and
moreover the resulting ﬂuid model possesses supersymmetry. However, since theories of ex-
tended “super” objects cannot be formulated in arbitrary dimensions, we shall consider the
ﬂuid in two spatial dimensions, namely, on the plane [31].

5.1 Chaplygin gas with Grassmann variables

We begin by positing the ﬂuid model. The Chaplygin gas Lagrangian in (95) is supplemented
by Grassmann variables ψa that are Majorana spinors [real, two-component: ψ∗a = ψa, a = 1, 2,
(ψ1ψ2)∗ = ψ∗1ψ∗2].

The associated Lagrange density reads

L = −ρ( ˙θ − 1

2 ψ ˙ψ) − 1

2 ρ(∇θ − 1

2 ψ∇ψ)2 −

√2λ

λ

ψα · ∇ψ .

(176)

Here αi are two (i = 1, 2), 2 × 2, real symmetric Dirac “alpha” matrices; in terms of Pauli
matrices we can take α1 = σ1, α2 = σ3. Note that the matrices satisfy the following relations,
which are needed to verify subsequent formulas

αi

bc = εijαj

bc = δijδac − εijεac
cd = δacδbd − δabδcd + δadδbc;

(177)

εab is the 2× 2 antisymmetric matrix ε ≡ iσ2. In equation (176) λ is a coupling strength which
is assumed to be positive. The Grassmann term enters with coupling √2λ, which is correlated
with the strength of the Chaplygin potential V (ρ) = λ/ρ in order to ensure supersymmetry,
as we shall show below. It is evident that the velocity should be deﬁned as

v = ∇θ − 1

2 ψ∇ψ .

(178)

The Grassmann variables directly give rise to a Clebsch formula for v, and provide the
Gauss potentials. The two-dimensional vorticity reads ω = εij∂ivj = − 1
∇ψ×
∇ψ. The variables {θ, ρ} remain a canonical pair, while the canonical 1-form in (176) indicates
that the canonically independent Grassmann variables are √ρ ψ so that the antibracket of the
ψ’s is

The momentum density P is given by the bosonic formula P = ρv, but the Grassmann
variables are hidden in v, by virtue of (178).

The equations of motion read

But T ij is not symmetric in its spatial indices, owing to the presence of spin in the problem.
However, rotational symmetry makes it possible to eﬀect an “improvement”, which modiﬁes
the momentum density by a total derivative term, leaving the integrated total momentum
unchanged (provided surface terms can be ignored) and rendering the stress tensor symmetric.
The improved quantities are

is conserved. The ﬁrst term is clearly the orbital part (which still receives a Grassmann
contribution through v), whereas the second, coming from the improvement, is the spin part.
Indeed, since i
2 σ2 ≡ Σ, we recognize this as the spin matrix in (2+1) dimensions.
The extra term in the improved momentum density (194), 1
8 εij∂j(ρψεψ), can then be readily
interpreted as an additional localized momentum density, generated by the nonhomogeneity of
the spin density. This is analogous to the magnetostatics formula giving the localized current
density jm in a magnet in terms of its magnetization m: jm = ∇ × m. All in all, we are
describing a ﬂuid with spin.

Also the total number

N =Z d2r ρ

(198)

is conserved by virtue of the continuity equation (183) satisﬁed by ρ. Finally, the theory is
Galileo invariant, as is seen from the conservation of the Galileo boost,

B = tP −Z d2r rρ

(199)

which follows from (183) and (191). The generators H, P , M, B and N close on the (extended)
Galileo group. [The theory is not Lorentz invariant in (2 + 1)-dimensional space-time, hence
the energy ﬂux T jo does not coincide with the momentum density, improved or not.]

44

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

We observe that ρ can be eliminated from (176) so that L involves only θ and ψ. From

(184) and (185) it follows that

ρ = √λ(cid:0) ˙θ − 1

2 ψ ˙ψ + 1

2 v2(cid:1)−1/2 .

Substituting into (176) produces the supersymmetric generalization of the Chaplygin gas La-
grange density in (108).

(200)

(201)

L = −2√λnq2 ˙θ − ψ ˙ψ + (∇θ − 1

2 ψ∇ψ)2 + 1

2 ψα · ∇ψo

Note that the coupling strength has disappeared from the dynamical equations, remaining
only as a normalization factor for the Lagrangian. Consequently the above elimination of ρ
cannot be carried out in the free case, λ = 0.

5.2 Supersymmetry

As we said earlier, this theory possesses supersymmetry. This can be established, ﬁrst of all,
by verifying that the following two-component supercharges are time-independent Grassmann
quantities.

Qa =Z d2rhρv · (αabψb) + √2λψai .

(202)

Taking a time derivative and using the evolution equations (183)–(186) establishes that ˙Qa = 0.
Next, the supersymmetric transformation rule for the dynamical variables is found by
constructing a bosonic symmetry generator Q, obtained by contracting the Grassmann charge
with a constant Grassmann parameter ηa, Q = ηaQa, and commuting with the dynamical
variables. Using the canonical brackets one veriﬁes the following ﬁeld transformation rules:

δρ = {Q, ρ} = −∇ · ρ(ηαψ)

δθ = {Q, θ} = − 1

(205)

(206)

Supersymmetry is reestablished by determining the variation of the action R dt d2r L conse-

quent to the above ﬁeld variations: the action is invariant. One then reconstructs the super-
charges (202) by Noether’s theorem. Finally, upon computing the bracket of two supercharges,
one ﬁnds

2Qb} = 2(η1η2)H

(207)

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

which again conﬁrms that the charges are time-independent:

Additionally a further, kinematical, supersymmetry can be identiﬁed. According to the

equations of motion the following two supercharges are also time-independent:

{H, Qa} = 0 .

(208)

¯Q = ¯ηa ¯Qa eﬀects a shift of the Grassmann ﬁeld:

¯Qa =Z d2r ρψa .

¯δρ = { ¯Q, ρ} = 0
¯δθ = { ¯Q, θ} = − 1
¯δψ = { ¯Q, ψ} = −¯η
¯δv = { ¯Q, v} = 0 .

(209)

(210)

(211)

(212)

(213)

This transformation leaves the Lagrangian invariant, and Noether’s theorem reproduces (209).
The algebra of these charges closes on the total number N .

(214)

while the algebra with the generators (202), closes on the total momentum, together with a

central extension, proportional to volume of space Ω =R d2r

{¯ηa ¯Qa, ηbQb} = (¯ηαη) · P + √2λ (¯ηεη)Ω .

(215)

The supercharges Qa, ¯Qa, together with the Galileo generators (H, P , M , and B), with N
form a superextended Galileo algebra. The additional, nonvanishing brackets are

{M, Qa} = 1
{M, ¯Qa} = 1

5.3 Supermembrane Connection

The equations for the supersymmetric Chaplygin ﬂuid devolve from a supermembrane La-
grangian, LM . We shall give two diﬀerent derivations of this result, which make use of two
diﬀerent parameterizations for the parameterization-invariant membrane action and give rise,
respectively, to (176) and (201). The two derivations follow what has been done in the bosonic
case in Sections 4.1 and 4.3.

We work in a light-cone gauge-ﬁxed theory: The supermembrane in 4-dimensional space-
time is described by coordinates X µ (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3), which are decomposed into light-cone
components X± = 1√2
(X 0 ± X 3) and transverse components X i {i = 1, 2}. These depend on

46

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

an evolution parameter ϕ0 ≡ τ and two space-like parameters ϕr {r = 1, 2}. Additionally there
are two-component, real Grassmann spinors ψ, which also depend on τ and ϕr. In the light-
cone gauge, X + is identiﬁed with τ , X− is renamed θ, and the supermembrane Lagrangian
is [32]

LM =Z d2ϕLM = −Z d2ϕ{

(221)

Here ∂τ signiﬁes diﬀerentiation with respect to the evolution parameter τ , while ∂r diﬀeren-
tiates with respect to the space-like parameters ϕr; grs is the inverse of grs, and the two are
used to move the (r, s) indices. Note that the dimensionality of the transverse coordinates X i
is the same as of the parameters ϕr, namely two.

5.4 Hodographic transformation

To give our ﬁrst derivation following the procedure in Section 4.3, we rewrite the Lagrangian
in canonical, ﬁrst-order form, with the help of bosonic canonical momenta deﬁned by

∂LM
∂∂τ X
∂LM
∂∂τ θ

= p = −Π∂τ X − Πur∂rX
= Π =pg/Γ .

(The Grassmann variables already enter with ﬁrst-order derivatives.) The supersymmetric
extension of (164) then reads

LM = p · ∂τ X + Π∂τ θ − 1

In (223) ur serves as a Lagrange multiplier enforcing a subsidiary condition on the canonical
variables, and g = det grs. The equations that follow from (223) coincide with the Euler-
Lagrange equations for (219). The theory still possesses an invariance against redeﬁning the
spatial parameters with a τ -dependent function of the parameters. This freedom may be used

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

47

to set uτ to zero and ﬁx Π at −1. Next we introduce the hodographic transformation, as in
Section 4.3, whereby independent-dependent variables are interchanged, namely we view the
ϕr to be functions of X i. It then follows that the constraint on (223), which with Π = −1
reads

becomes

p · ∂rX − ∂rθ + 1

2 ψ∂rψ = 0

∂rX ·(cid:16)p − ∇θ + 1

2 ψ∇ψ(cid:17) = 0 .

(224)

(225)

Here p, θ and ψ are viewed as functions of X, renamed r, with respect to which acts the
gradient ∇. Also we rename p as v, which according to (225) is

As in Section 4.3, from the chain rule and the implicit function theorem it follows that

v = ∇θ − 1

2 ψ∇ψ .

(226)

∂τ = ∂t + ∂τ X · ∇

(227)

and according to (222a) (at Π = −1, ur = 0) ∂τ X = p = v. Finally, the measure transforms
according to d2ϕ → d2r 1√g . Thus the Lagrangian for (223) becomes, after setting ur to zero
and Π to −1,

LM =Z d2r

√g(cid:16)v2 − ˙θ − v·∇θ + 1

But εrs∂sxj∂rxi = εij det ∂rxi = εij√g. After √g is renamed √2λ/ρ, (228a) ﬁnally reads

LM =

5.5 Light-cone parameterization

For our second derivation, we return to (219)–(221) and use the remaining reparameterization
freedom to equate the two X i variables with the two ϕr variables, renaming both as ri. Also
τ is renamed as t. This parallels the method in Section 4.1. Now in (219)–(221) grs = δrs, and
∂τ X = 0, so that (221) becomes simply

G = Γ = 2 ˙θ − ψ ˙ψ + u2
2 ψ∇ψ .

u = ∇θ − 1

(229)

(230)

48

2 ψ∇ψ(cid:1)2 + 1

2 ψα × ∇ψ(cid:27) .

(231)

Again a replacement of ψ by 1√2
Lagrange density in (201) (apart from a normalization factor).

(1 − ε)ψ demonstrates that the integrand coincides with the

5.6 Further consequences of the supermembrane connection

Supermembrane dynamics is Poincar´e invariant in (3+1)-dimensional space-time. This invari-
ance is hidden by the choice of light-cone parameterization: only the light-cone subgroup of the
Poincar´e group is left as a manifest invariance. This is just the (2 + 1) Galileo group generated
by H, P , M , B, and N . (The light-cone subgroup of the Poincar´e group is isomorphic to
the Galileo group in one lower dimension [33].) The Poincar´e generators not included in the
above list correspond to Lorentz transformations in the “−” direction. We expect therefore
that these generators are “dynamical”, that is, hidden and unexpected conserved quantities of
our supersymmetric Chaplygin gas, similar to the situation with the purely bosonic model.

One veriﬁes that the following quantities

D = tH −Z d2r ρθ
G =Z d2r(rH − θP I − 1
=Z d2r(rH − θP − 1

8 ψαα · P I ψ)

4 ψαα · Pψ)

(232)

(233)

are time-independent by virtue of the equations of motion (183)–(186), and they supplement
the Galileo generators to form the full (3 + 1) Poincar´e algebra, which becomes the super-
Poincar´e algebra once the supersymmetry is taken into account. Evidently (232), (233) are
the supersymmetric generalizations of (105), (106).

We see that ﬂuid dynamics can be extended to include Grassmann variables, which also
enter in a supersymmetry-preserving interaction. Since our construction is based on a super-
membrane in (3+1)-dimensional space-time, the ﬂuid model is necessarily a planar Chaplygin
gas. It remains for the future to show how this construction could be generalized to arbitrary
dimensions and to diﬀerent interactions. Note that Grassmann Gauss potentials ψ can be
used even in the absence of supersymmetry. For example, our theory (176), with the last
term omitted, posseses a conventional, bosonic Hamiltonian without supersymmetry, while
the Grassmann variables are hidden in v and occur only in the canonical 1-form.

6 One-dimensional Case

In this section, I shall discuss the nonrelativistic/relativistic models in one spatial dimension.
Complete integrability has been established for both the Chaplygin gas [34] and the Born-Infeld
theory [35]. We can now understand this to be a consequence of the complete integrability
of the Nambu-Goto 1-brane (string) moving on 2-space (plane), which is the antecedent of
both models.
[Therefore, it suﬃces to discuss only the Chaplygin gas since solutions of the
Born-Infeld model can then be obtained by the mapping (172)–(173).]

As remarked previously, in one dimension there is no vorticity, and the nonrelativistic
velocity v can be presented as a derivative with respect to the single spatial variable of a

potential θ. In both cases the potential is canonically conjugate to the density ρ governed

potential θ. Similarly, the relativistic momentum p = v/p1 − v2/c2 is a derivative of a
by the canonical 1-form R dx θ ˙ρ. Moreover, it is evident that at the expense of a spatial

nonlocality, one may replace θ by its antiderivative, which is p both nonrelativistically and
relativistically (nonrelativistically p = v), so that in both cases the Lagrangian reads

L = − 1

6.1 Speciﬁc solutions for the Chaplygin gas on a line

Classes of solutions for a Chaplygin gas in one dimension can be given in closed form. For
example, to obtain general, time-rescaling–invariant solutions, we make the Ansatz that θ ∝
1/t. Then (109) or (239) leads to a second-order nonlinear diﬀerential equation for the x-
dependence of θ. Therefore solutions involve two arbitrary constants, one of which ﬁxes the
origin of x (we suppress it); the other we call k, and take it to be real. The solutions then read

θ(t, x) = −

2k2t

cosh2 kx .

(243)

[Other solutions can be obtained by relaxing the reality condition on k and/or shifting the
2k2t sinh2 kx,
argument kx by a complex number. In this way one ﬁnds that θ can also be
2k2t sin2 kx,
2k2t cos2 kx; but these lead to singular or unphysical forms for ρ.] The density
corresponding to (243) is found from (96) or (238) to be

The velocity/momentum v = p = ∂

while the sound speed

is always larger than |v|. Finally, the current j = ρ ∂θ
∂x exhibits a kink proﬁle,

cosh2 kx

s(t, x) =

j(t, x) = −ε(t)√2λ tanh kx

which is suggestive of complete integrability.

Another particular solution is the Galileo boost of the static proﬁles (115), (116):

p(t, x) = p(x − ut)
ρ(t, x) =

(246)

(248)

(249)

Here u is the boosting velocity and p(x− ut) is an arbitrary function of its argument (provided
p 6= u). Clearly this is a constant proﬁle solution, in linear motion with velocity u.

Further evidence for complete integrability is found by identifying an inﬁnite number of

constants of motion. One veriﬁes that the following quantities

6.2 Aside on the integrability of the cubic potential in one
dimension

Although it does not belong to the models that we have discussed, the cubic potential for
1-dimensional motion, V (ρ) = ℓρ3/3, is especially interesting because it is secretly free – a
fact that is exposed when Riemann coordinates are employed. For this problem these read
√2ℓρ and again they are just the velocity (±) the sound speed. In contrast to (252)
R± = p ±
∂x R±. Indeed, it is
the Euler and continuity equations for this system decouple:
seen that R± satisfy essentially the free Euler equation [compare with (42) and identify R±
with v]. Consequently, the solution (44)–(46) works here as well.

˙R± = −R±

∂

Recall the previous remark in Section 3.1 on the Schr¨odinger group [Galileo ⊕ SO(2,1)]:
in one dimension the cubic potential is invariant against this group of transformations, and in
all dimensions the free theory is invariant [17], [18]. Therefore a natural speculation is that
the secretly noninteracting nature of the cubic potential in one dimension is a consequence of
Schr¨odinger group invariance.

Another interesting fact about a one-dimensional nonrelativistic ﬂuid with cubic potential
is that it also arises in a collective, semiclassical description of nonrelativistic free fermions in
one dimension, where the cubic potential reproduces fermion repulsion [36]. In spite of the
nonlinearity of the ﬂuid model’s equations of motion, there is no interaction in the underlying
fermion dynamics. Thus, the presence of the Schr¨odinger group and the equivalence to free
equations for this ﬂuid system is an understandable consequence.

6.3 General solution for the Chaplygin gas on a line

The general solution to the Chaplygin gas can be found by linearizing the governing equations
(continuity and Euler) with the help of a Legendre transform, which also eﬀects a hodographic
transformation that exchanges the independent variables (t, x) with the dependent ones (ρ, θ);
actually instead of ρ we use the sound speed s = √2λ/ρ and instead of θ we use the momentum

It remains to incorporate the continuity equation (237) whose content must be recast by
the hodographic transformation. This is achieved by rewriting equation (237) in terms of
s = √2λ/ρ:

Next (257) is presented as a relation between Jacobians:

(257)

(258a)

which is true because here ∂x/∂t = ∂t/∂x = 0. Eq. (258a) implies, after multiplication by
∂(t, x)/∂(s, p)

0 =

(258b)

The second equality holds because now we take ∂s/∂p = ∂p/∂s = 0. Finally, from (255), (256)
it follows that (258b) is equivalent to

6.4 Born-Infeld model on a line

Since the Born-Infeld system is related to Chaplygin gas by the transformation described in
Section 4.4, there is no need to discuss separately Born-Infeld solutions. Nevertheless, the
formulation in terms of Riemann coordinates is especially succinct and gives another view on
the Chaplygin/Born-Infeld relation.

The Riemann coordinates R± for the Born-Infeld model are contructed by ﬁrst deﬁning

and

θ = p/c = tan ϕp

presented as

˙R± = −c(sin R∓)

∂

R± .

(263)

The relation to the Riemann description of the Chaplygin gas can now be seen in two ways:
a nonrelativistic limit and an exact transformation. For the former, we note that at large c,
ϕp ≈ p/c, ϕρ ≈ a/ρc so that

so that (252) is regained. On the other hand, for the exact transformation we deﬁne new
Riemann coordinates in the relativistic, Born-Infeld case by

R± = c sin R± .

(266)

Evidently (263) implies that R± satisﬁes the nonrelativistic equations (252), (265) when R±
solves the relativistic equation (263). Expressing R± and R± in terms of the corresponding
nonrelativistic and relativistic variables produces a mapping between the two sets. Calling
pNR, ρNR and pR, ρR the momentum and density of the nonrelativistic and of the relativistic
theory, respectively, the mapping implied by (266) is

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

As can be checked, this maps the Chaplygin equations into the Born-Infeld equations. But
the mapping is not canonical.

We record the inﬁnite number of constants of motion, which put into evidence the (by now
obvious) complete integrability of the Born-Infeld equations on a line. The following quantities
are time-independent:

I±n = acn−1Z dx

(ϕp ± ϕρ)n
sin ϕρ cos ϕp

, n = 0,±1, . . .

(268)

The nonrelativistic limit takes the above into (250), while expressing I±n in terms of R±
according to (266) shows that the integrals in (268) are expressible as series in terms of the
integrals in (250).

In the relativistic model ρ need not be constrained to be positive (negative ρ could be
interpreted as antiparticle density). The transformation p → −p, ρ → −ρ is a symmetry and
can be interpreted as charge conjuguation. Further, p and ρ appear in an equivalent way. As
a result, this theory enjoys a duality transformation:

ρ → ±

a
c2 p

p → ±

c2

ρ .

(269)

Under the above, both the canonical structure and the Hamiltonian remain invariant. Solutions
are mapped in general to new solutions. Note that the nonrelativistic limit is mapped to the
ultra-relativistic one under the above duality. Self-dual solutions, with ρ = ± a

c2 p, satisfy

˙ρ = ∓c

(270)

and are, therefore, the chiral relativistic solutions that were presented at the end of Section 3.2.
In the self-dual case, when p is eliminated from the canonical 1-form and from the Hamiltonian
with the help of (269), one arrives at an action for ρ, which coincides (apart from irrelevant
constants) with the self-dual action, constructed some time ago [37]

6.5 General solution of the Nambu-Goto theory for a (d=1)-

brane (string) in two spatial dimensions (on a plane)

The complete integrability of the Chaplygin gas and of the Born-Infeld theory, as well as the
relationships between the two, derives from the fact that the diﬀerent models descend by ﬁxing
in diﬀerent ways the parameterization invariance of the Nambu-Goto theory for string on a
plane. At the same time, the equations governing the planar motion of a string can be solved
completely. Therefore it is instructive to see how the string solution produces this Chaplygin
solution [21].

(X 0 ± X 2), rename X− as θ, and choose the
parameterization X + = ϕ0 ≡ τ . After suppressing the superscripts on ϕ0 and X 1, we construct
the Nambu-Goto Lagrange density as

There still remains the reparameterization freedom of replacing ϕ by an arbitrary function
of τ and ϕ; this freedom may be used to set u = 0, Π = −1. Consequently, in the fully
parameterized equations of motion Eq. (276d) disappears; instead of (276a) and (276c), we
have ∂τ X = p, ∂τ p = ∂2

ϕX, which imply

and the constraint (277) requires

∂ϕθ = ∂τ X∂ϕX .

Solution to (278a) is immediate in terms of two functions F±,

x(τ, ϕ) = F+(τ + ϕ) + F−(τ − ϕ)

and then (278b), (278c) ﬁx θ:

θ(τ, ϕ) =Z τ +ϕ

dz(cid:2)F ′+(z)(cid:3)2 +Z τ−ϕ

dz(cid:2)F ′

−(z)(cid:3)2 .

This completes the description of a string moving on a plane. But we need to convert this
information into a solution of the Chaplygin gas, and we know from Section 4.3 that this can
be accomplished by a hodographic transformation: instead of X and θ as a function of τ and
ϕ, we seek ϕ as a function of τ and X, and this renders θ to be a function of τ and X as well.
The density ρ is determined by the Jacobian |∂X/∂ϕ|.

Replace τ by t and X by x and deﬁne ϕ to be f (t, x). Then from (279) it follows that

This equation may be diﬀerentiated with respect to t and x, whereupon one ﬁnds

x = F+(cid:0)t + f (t, x)(cid:1) + F−(cid:0)t − f (t, x)(cid:1) .

7 Towards a Non-Abelian Fluid Mechanics

Fluid mechanics and ﬂuid magnetohydrodynamics may very well describe the long-wavelength
degrees of freedom in a quark-gluon plasma. Moreover it is plausible that the group (color)
degrees of freedom remain distinct in that regime, so that one should incorporate them in
the ﬂuid approximation. In this way one is led to think about constructing non-Abelian ﬂuid
mechanics and (color) magnetohydrodynamics. In this section we describe an approach to this
task [38]. In the course of development, we encounter and solve an interesting mathematical
problem: how to parameterize a non-Abelian vector potential so that the non-Abelian Chern-
Simons density becomes a total derivative, and the volume-integrated Chern-Simons term is
given by a surface integral. Obviously this is the non-Abelian generalization of the similar
Abelian problem, which is solved by presenting the Abelian vector potential in Clebsch form.
So we shall determine the non-Abelian version of the Clebsch parameterization.

7.1 Proposal for non-Abelian ﬂuid mechanics

We review our Lagrange density for relativistic Abelian ﬂuid mechanics (144):

L = −jµaµ − f (pjµjµ) .

(292)

The equation of state is encoded in the function f . For free ﬂuid motion f (pjµjµ) = cpjµjµ.

Here jµ is the matter current and aµ is an auxilliary 4-vector, which is presented in the form

aµ = ∂µθ + α∂µβ .

(293)

The time component a0, involving time derivatives, determines the canonical 1-form; the
spatial components a are in the Clebsch parameterization, as is needed for overcoming the
obstacle created by a Casimir invariant of the ﬂuid in the algebra (14), (16). Another way of
characterizing the parameterization of the vector a is that it casts the Chern-Simons density
of a, namely, a · ∇ × a into total derivative form: ∇θ · (∇α × ∇β) = ∇ · (θ∇ × a).

For a non-Abelian generalization, it is plausible to suppose that the current 4-vector ac-
quires an internal symmetry index: J µ
a ; correspondingly, the auxiliary 4-vector must also
acquire an internal symmetry index: Aa
It remains to give a rule for parameterizing Aa
µ.
µ,
which generalizes the Abelian rule (293).

Our proposal – and it is a speculative one, since at this stage we have no derivation
from microscopic considerations – is that Aa
µ should be written in a form so that its non-
Abelian Chern-Simons density, CS(A) = Aa dAa + 1
3 f abcAaAbAc, is a total derivative (f abc are
the structure constants of the group). This leads us to the purely mathematical problem of
constructing a parameterization for a non-Abelian vector that ensures this property.

60

R. Jackiw — (A Particle Field Theorist’s)

7.2 Non-Abelian Clebsch parameterization

(or, casting the non-Abelian Chern-Simons density into total derivative form)

We enquire whether it is possible to parameterize the non-Abelian 1-form, Aa, such that the
Chern-Simons 3-form is a total derivative (is exact):

CS(A) = Aa dAa + 1

3 f abcAaAbAc = dΩ .

(294)

That this should be possible follows from the observation that the left side of (294) is a 3-form
on 3-space; hence it is closed, because a 4-form does not exist in 3-space. [Of course on a 4-
dimensional space the exterior derivative of (294) is proportional to the non-Abelian anomaly
(Chern-Pontryagin density) [13].] But a closed form is also exact, at least locally; this justiﬁes
the right side of (294).

How this works in the Abelian case has already been explored in Sections 2.4 and 2.5: the
Clebsch parameterization (58), (60) for A leads to the desired result. But the generalization
of (58), (60) for a non-Abelian 1-form is not evident. However, at the end of Section 2.5, an
alternative approach is presented, wherein the Abelian 1-form is projected from a non-Abelian
pure gauge 1-form. This construction can be generalized to the non-Abelian case and yields
the sought-for parameterization.

The mathematical problem can therefore be formulated in the following way: For a given
group H, how can one construct a potential Aa
i ) such that the non-Abelian Chern-
Simons integrand CS(A) is a total derivative? Here we shall only sketch the solution to the
problem, referring those interested to Ref. [38] for a detailed discussion.

µ = (Aa

In the solution that we present, the “total derivative” form for the Chern-Simons density of
Aa is achieved in two steps. The parameterization, which we ﬁnd, directly leads to an Abelian
form of the Chern-Simons density:

Aa dAa + 1

3 f abcAaAbAc = γ dγ

(295)

for some γ. Then Darboux’s theorem [10] (or usual ﬂuid dynamical theory [11]) ensures that
γ can be presented in Clebsch form, so that γ dγ is explicitly a total derivative.

We begin with a pure gauge g−1 dg in some non-Abelian group G (called the Ur-group)

whose Chern-Simons integral coincides with the winding number of g.

W (g) =

1

16π2 Z d3r CS(g−1 dg) =

1

24π2 Z tr(g−1 dg)3

(296)

We consider a normal subgroup H ⊂ G, with generators I a, and construct a non-Abelian
gauge potential for H by projection:

Aa ∝ tr(I ag−1 dg) .

(297)

Within H, this is not a pure gauge. We determine the group structure that ensures the
Chern-Simons 3-form of Aa to be proportional to tr(g−1 dg)3. Consequently, the constructed

Lectures on (Supersymmetric, Non-Abelian) Fluid Mechanics (and d-Branes)

61

non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds, belonging to the group H, carry quantized Chern-Simons number.
Moreover, we describe the properties of the Ur-group G that guarantee that the projected
potential Aa enjoys suﬃcient generality to represent an arbitrary potential in H.

Since tr(g−1 dg)3 is a total derivative for an arbitrary group (although this fact cannot in
general be expressed in ﬁnite terms [39]) our construction ensures that the form of Aa, which is
achieved through the projection (297), produces a “total derivative” expression (in the limited
sense indicated above) for its Chern-Simons density.

Conditions on the Ur-group G, which we take to be compact and semi-simple, are the
following. First of all G has to be so chosen that it has suﬃcient number of parameters to
make tr(I ag−1 dg) a generic potential for H. Since we are in three dimensions, an H-potential
Aa
i has 3 × dimH independent functions; so a minimal requirement will be

dim G ≥ 3 dim H .

(298)

Secondly we require that the H-Chern-Simons form for Aa should coincide with that of g−1 dg.
As we shall show in a moment, this is achieved if G/H is a symmetric space. In this case, if
we split the Lie algebra of G into the H-subalgebra spanned by I a, a = 1, . . . , dim H, and the
orthogonal complement spanned by SA, A = 1, . . . , (dim G − dim H), the commutation rules
are of the form

[I a, I b] = f abcI c
[I a, SA] = haABSB
[SA, SB] = N haABI a .

(299a)

(299b)

(299c)

(ha)AB form a (possibly reducible) representation of the H-generators I a. The constant N
depends on normalizations. More explicitly, if the structure constants for the Ur-group G
are named ¯f abc, a, b, c = 1, . . . , dimG, then the conditions (299a–c) require that ¯f abc vanishes
whenever an odd number of indices belongs to the orthogonal complement labeled by A, B, ...
Moreover, f abc are taken to be the conventional structure constants for H and this may render
them proportional to (rather than equal to) ¯f abc.

We deﬁne the traces of the generators by
tr(I aI b) = −N1δab
tr(I aSA) = 0 .

,

tr(SASB) = −N2δAB

(300)

We can evaluate the quantity tr[SA, SB]I a = tr SA[SB, I a] using the commutation rules. This
immediately gives the relation N1N = N2.

Expanding g−1 dg in terms of generators, we write

which deﬁnes the H-potential Aa. Equivalently

g−1 dg = (I aAa + SAαA)

Aa = −

tr(g−1 dg)3 .

(304)

In the above sequence of manipulations, we have used the Maurer-Cartan relations (303),
which rely on the symmetric space structure of (299a–c), and the trace relations (300), along
with N1N = N2.

We thus see that R CS(A) is indeed the winding number of the conﬁguration g ∈ G. Since

tr(g−1 dg)3 is a total derivative locally on G, the potential (302), with the symmetric space
structure of (299a–c), does indeed fulﬁll the requirement of making CS(A) a total derivative.
It is therefore appropriate to call our construction (302) a “non-Abelian Clebsch parameteri-
zation”.

In explicit realizations, given a gauge group of interest H, we need to choose a group G
such that the conditions (298), (299a–c) hold. In general this is not possible. However, one can
proceed recursively. Let us suppose that the desired result has been established for a group,
which we call H2. Then we form H ⊂ G obeying (299a–c) as H = H1 × H2, where H1 is the
gauge group of interest, satisfying dimG ≥ 3 dimH1. For this choice of H, the result (304)
becomes

CS(H1) + CS(H2) =

1

48π2N1

tr(g−1 dg)3

(305)

But since CS(H2) is already known to be a total derivative, (305) shows the desired result:
CS(H1) is a total derivative.

To see explicitly how this works we work out the representation for a SU(2) ≈ O(3) potential
i , which possesses nine independent functions.

We take G = O(5), H = O(3) × O(2). We consider the 4-dimensional spinorial representa-
tion of O(5). With the generators normalized by tr(tatb) = −δab, the Lie algebra generators

σ’s are the 2 × 2 Pauli matrices. I a generate O(3), with the conventional structure constants
εabc, and I 0 is the generator of O(2). S, ˜S are the coset generators.

A general group element in O(5) can be written in the form g = M hk where h ∈ O(3),

k ∈ O(2), and

M =

(307)

wa is a complex 3-dimensional vector, with the bar denoting complex conjugation. w · ¯w =
wa ¯wa and (w × ¯w)a = εabcwb ¯wc. The general O(5) group element contains ten independent
real functions. These are collected as six from M (in the three complex functions wa), three
in h, and one in k.

The O(3) gauge potential given by − tr(I ag−1 dg) reads

Aa = Rab(h) ab + (h−1 dh)a

aa =

where Rab(h) is deﬁned by hI ah−1 = Rabhb and k does not contribute. Aa is the h-gauge
transform of aa, which depends on six real parameters (wa). The three gauge parameters of
h ∈ O(3), along with the six, give the nine functions needed to parameterize a general O(3)-
[or SU (2)-] potential in three dimensions. The Chern-Simons form is

The second equality reﬂects the usual response of the Chern-Simons density to gauge trans-
formations. Using the explicit form of aa as given in (308), we can further reduce this. Indeed
we ﬁnd that

If desired, the Abelian potential a can now be written in the Clebsch form making a da into
a total derivative, while the remaining two terms already are total derivatives, though in a
“hidden” form for the last expression. This completes our construction.

7.3 Proposal for non-Abelian magnetohydrodynamics

We return to our construction of a Lagrange density for non-Abelian kinetic theory. As
explained in Section 7.1, a plausible non-Abelian generalization for (292) is

L = −J µa 1

tr I ag−1∂µg − cpJ µaJ a

µ

(313)

where for simplicity we have taken the “free” form for f . When the desired group is SU(2), g
is an O(5) group element, as detailed in Section 7.2.

Magnetohydrodynamics is achieved by introducing a further interaction with a dynamical
µ. This is accomplished by promoting the derivative of g to a gauge-covariant

gauge potential Aa

We expect that the Lagrangian (314) will describe non-Abelian magnetohydrodynamics,
namely the dynamics of a ﬂuid with non-Abelian charge coupled to non-Abelian ﬁelds. [The
Abelian version of (314) does indeed describe ordinary magnetohydrodynamics.] This gluon
hydrodynamics can be useful for non-Abelian plasmas such as the quark-gluon plasma. Details
of (314) and possible applications are under further study.

(a) Extracting the ﬁrst derivative leaves CS(A) = ∂iV i

a = εijkΦ∂j cos Θ∂kh(r). (This is
true because εijk∂i∂j cos Θ = 0 = εijk∂i∂kh(r), since cos Θ and h(r) are nonsingular.)
Note that V i
a = 0, the surface
integral does not contribute. However, since Φ is multivalued, there is a contribution from

Here the surface integral contributes 4πh(R). The singular term is

Hence this contribution to the spatial integral is −4πh(0), for a total of 4π(cid:2)h(R)− h(0)(cid:3).
Problem 5 In the Clebsch parameterization, B = ∇α × ∇β, and δA = ∇δγ + δα∇β +
α∇δβ. Therefore

B · δA = B · ∇δγ + B · α∇δβ + (B · ∇β)δα

= ∇ · (Bδγ) + ∇ · (Bαδβ) − (B · ∇α)δβ + (B · ∇β)δα .

The last two terms vanish, so R d3r A · B is the surface term R dS ·B(δγ + αδβ) with no
contribution from the bulk (ﬁnite r space). This of course is consistent with the Chern-
Simons integral being a surface term, since δ 1
2R d3r A · B = R d3r B · δA. When demanding
the variation of 1
2R d3r B2 to vanish, we ﬁrst ﬁndR d3r(∇×B)·δA = 0. When δA is arbitrary,
this condition implies the vanishing of ∇ × B. However, in the Clebsch parameterization, all
we can conclude is that ∇× B is proportional to B, with a position-dependent proportionality
factor ∇× B = µB. Taking the divergence shows that B· ∇µ = 0, that is, µ can be a function
of the magnetic surfaces; see (64), (69).

Problem 6 θ(t, r) = r2/2t. Time rescaling: θω(t, r) = eωθ(T, r), T = eωt; eωθ(T, r) =
eωr2/2eωt = r2/2t = θ(t, r).

Space-time mixing: θω(t, r) = θ(T, R), T = t + ω · r + 1

2 ω2θ(T, R) = t + ω · r + ω2R2/4T ,
R = r + ωθ(T, R) = r + ωR2/2T . Squaring the second equation gives R2 = r2 + ω · rR2/T +
ω2R4/4T 2. Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by R2/T gives R2 = tR2/T + ω· rR2/T + ω2R4/4T 2.
Comparing the two shows that R2/T = r2/t or θ(T, R) = θ(t, r).

Problem 7 From (256) and (259) we learn that t = F ′′ + G′′, x = (p + s)F ′′ − F ′ +
(p − s)G′′ − G′, where F is a function of p + s = R+ and G is a function of p − s = R−.
Diﬀerentiating these equations with respect to t and x, it follows that 1 = F ′′′ ˙R+ + G′′′ ˙R−,
0 = F ′′′ ∂R+
∂x , which in turn
imply ∂R+
∂R±

Ref. [20]. Generalization to arbitrary d is given in R. Jackiw and A.P. Polychronakos, Proc.
Steklov Inst. Math. 226, 193 (1999) and Ref. [24].

The phenomenon of apparent slip in micro-channel ﬂows is analyzed by means of a two-phase
mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann model including non-ideal ﬂuid-ﬂuid and ﬂuid-wall interactins. The
weakly-inhomogeneous limit of this model is solved analytically. The present mesoscopic approach
permits to access much larger scales than molecular dynamics, and comparable with those attained
by continuum methods. However, at variance with the continuum approach, the existence of a gas
layer near the wall does not need to be postulated a priori, but emerges naturally from the underlying
non-ideal mesoscopic dynamics. It is therefore argued that a mesoscopic Lattice Boltzmann approach
with non-ideal ﬂuid-ﬂuid and ﬂuid-wall interactions might achieve an optimal compromise between
physical realism and computational eﬃciency for the study of channel micro-ﬂows.

The microscopic physics underlying ﬂuid/solid inter-
actions is fairly rich and complex, for it depends on spe-
ciﬁc details of molecular interactions as well as on the
micro-geometrical details of the boundary. However, on
a macroscopic scale, these details can often be safely ig-
nored by assuming that the net eﬀect of surface interac-
tions is simply to prevent any relative motion between the
solid walls and the ﬂuid elements next to them. This is
the so-called “no-slip” boundary condition, which forms
the basis of mathematical treatments of bounded ﬂows
as continuum media [1]. No-slip boundary conditions are
extremely successful in describing a huge class of viscous
ﬂows. Yet, the evidence is that certain classes of viscous
ﬂows do slip on the wall. Recent advances in microﬂuidics
experiments [2, 3], as well as numerical investigations
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8], have identiﬁed the conditions which seem to
underlie the validity of the no-slip assumption. Namely:
(i) single-phase ﬂow; (ii) wetted surfaces and (iii) low lev-
els of shear rates. Under such conditions, careful exper-
iments have shown that ﬂuid comes to rest within a few
molecular diameters from the surface [9, 10, 11, 12]. Con-
ditions (i-iii) are not exhaustive, though. For instance,
partial slips of simple (Newtonian) ﬂows, such as alkanes
and water, is predicted by an increasing number of ex-
periments [13, 14, 15, 16] and simulations [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
(see [17] for a review on experiments and numerics). Un-
der this state of aﬀairs, there appears to be a great need
to provide a convincing, and possibly general, theoreti-
cal picture for the onset of slip motion. Among others,
an increasingly popular explanation is that the ﬂowing
ﬂuid would develop a lighter (less dense) phase and dy-
namically segregate it in the form of a thin ﬁlm sticking
to the wall [18, 19]. This thin ﬁlm would then provide
a “gliding” surface for the bulk ﬂuid which would slip
on it without ever coming in contact with the solid wall.
This gives rise to the so-called apparent slip phenomenon,
that is, the extrapolated bulk ﬂow speed would vanish
far-out away from the wall, even though the actual ﬂow

speed in the ﬁlm does vanish exactly at the wall location.
This ﬁlm-picture is very appealing, but still in great need
of theoretical clariﬁcation. In particular, the underlying
mechanisms of ﬁlm formation are still under question:
are they generic or detail-driven?
In this paper we shall propose that ﬁlm formation is a
generic phenomenon, which can be captured by a one-
parameter mesoscopic approach, lying in-between the mi-
croscopic (atomistic) and macroscopic (continuum) lev-
els. The mesoscopic approach is based on a minimal
(lattice) Boltzmann equation, (LBE) [20, 21, 23], includ-
ing non-ideal interactions [22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28], which
can drive dynamic phase transitions. The only free pa-
rameter in the LBE is the strength of these non-ideal
(potential energy) interactions. Hopefully, the present
mesoscopic approach provides an optimal compromise
between the need of including complex physics (phase-
transition) not easily captured by a continuum approach,
and the need of accessing experimentally relevant space-
time scales which are out of reach to microscopic Molec-
ular Dynamics (MD) simulations [4, 6, 7, 8]. In particu-
lar, at variance with the macroscopic approach, the gas
ﬁlm does not need to be postulated a-priori, but emerges
dynamically from the underlying mesoscopic description,
by progressive switching of potential interactions. One
major advantage of this formulation is that it allows to
develop a simple and straightforward analytical interpre-
tation of the results as well as of the eﬀective slip length
arising in the ﬂow. This interpretation is based on the
macroscopic limit of the model which can be achieved by
a standard Chapman-Enskog expansion.
The lattice Boltzmann model used in this paper to de-
scribe multiple phases has been developed in [22]. Since
this model is well documented in the literature, here we
shall provide only the basic facts behind it. We recall that
the model is a minimal discrete version of the Boltzmann

equation, and reads as follows:

1
τ (cid:16)

l

fl(x, t) − f (eq)

fl(x + cl, t + 1) − fl(x, t) = −

(x, t)
(cid:17)
(1)
where fl(x, t) is the probability density function associ-
ated to a mesoscopic velocity cl and where τ is a mean
collision time and f (eq)
(x, t) the equilibrium distribution
that corresponds to the Maxwellian distribution in the
fully continuum limit. The bulk interparticle interaction
is proportional to a free parameter, Gb, entering the bal-
ance equation for the momentum change:

l

wlΨ [ρ(x)] Ψ [ρ(x + cl)] cl

(2)

being wl the equilibrium weights and Ψ the potential
function which describes the ﬂuid-ﬂuid interaction trig-
gered by density variation. By Taylor expanding eq.(2)
one recovers, in the hydrodynamical limit, the equation
of motion for a non-ideal ﬂuid with equation of state
s(ρ − 1
2 GbΨ2(ρ)), cs being the sound speed velocity.
P = c2
With the choice

Ψ(ρ) = 1 − exp(−ρ/ρ0)

b . In our case, Gc

with ρ0 = 1 a reference density, the model supports phase
transitions whenever the control parameter exceeds the
critical threshold Gb > Gc
b = 4 for an
averaged density hρi = log(2).
We consider Gb as an external control parameter, with no
need of responding to a self-consistent temperature dy-
namics. It has been pointed out [30] that the SC model
is aﬀected by spurious currents near the interface due to
lack of conservation of local momentum. This criticism,
however, rests on an ambiguous interpretation of the ﬂuid
velocity in the presence of intermolecular interactions. In
fact, spurious currents can be shown to disappear com-
pletely once the instantaneous pre and post-collisional
currents are replaced by a time-average over a collisional
time. This averaged quantity is readily checked to fulﬁll
both continuity and momentum conservation equations
without leading to any spurious current [31]. Let us now
consider the main result of this letter, namely the critical
interplay between the bulk physics and the presence of
wall eﬀects. In fact, in order to make contact with exper-
iments and MD simulations, it is important to include
ﬂuid-wall interactions, and notably a parametric form
of mesoscopic interactions capable of mimicking wetta-
bility properties as described by contact angles between
droplets and the solid wall [32]. This eﬀect is achieved
by assuming that the interaction with the wall is repre-
sented as an external force Fw normal to the wall and
decaying exponentially [28, 29], i.e.

Fw(x) = Gwρ(x)e−|x−xw|/ξ

(3)

where xw is a vector running along the wall location and
ξ the typical length-scale of the ﬂuid-wall interaction.

of a few µm for liquid water.

Equation (3) has been previously used in literature by
using a slightly diﬀerent LBE scheme to show how the
wetting angle depends on the ratio Gw/Gb in presence of
phase coexistence between vapor and liquid [28]. Here
we want to study the opposite situation, i.e. the eﬀects
of Gw when the thermodynamically stable bulk physics
is governed by a single phase. The main result is that
the presence of the wall may trigger a local phase co-
existence inducing the formation of a less dense phase
in the vicinity of the walls and an apparent slip of the
bulk ﬂuid velocity proﬁle extrapolated at the wall loca-
tion. Equations (1-3) have been numerically solved for
diﬀerent values of the parameters Gb, Gw and ξ in a two
dimensional channel with periodic boundary conditions
in the stream-wise x direction, being y = 0 and y = Ly
the wall positions. The sign of Gw is such to give a re-
pulsive force for the liquid particles at the wall.

The ﬂow is driven by a constant pressure gradient in
the x direction Fi = δi,x∂xP0. No-slip boundary condi-
tions are used at the wall and for small Knudsen numbers,
i.e. in the large scale limit, the numerical solutions have
been checked against its weakly-inhomogeneous macro-
scopic hydrodynamic limit, namely:

∂tρ + ∂i(uiρ) = 0

s(τ − 1/2) and P is the total pres-
sure consisting of an ideal-gas contribution, c2

so-called excess pressure, Vef f , due to potential-energy
interactions. The expression of Vef f in terms of both Gb

and Gw reads:

Let us notice that the continuum equation (4) naturally
predicts the increase of the mass ﬂow rate in presence
of a density proﬁle which becomes more and more rar-
eﬁed by approaching the wall [18]. Indeed, under station-
ary conditions, the continuity equation in (4) reduces to
∂y(ρuy) = 0, which, because of the boundary conditions,
implies ρuy = 0, i.e. uy = 0 everywhere. Thus, in a ho-
mogeneous channel along the stream-wise direction, the
velocity ux satisﬁes the equation

ν∂y(ρ∂yux) = −∂xP0.

In the new variable, y′ = y − H, where H = Ly/2, we
may express the solution of (5) as:

ux(y′) = −

Using (6) and assuming that density variations are con-
centrated in a smaller layer of thickness δ near the wall,
we can estimate the mass ﬂow rate Qef f for small δ as:

is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between ρ computed in the
center of the channel and ρw computed at the wall. The
eﬀective slip length is then usually deﬁned in terms of
the increment in the mass ﬂow rate [17]:

This is the best one can obtain by using a purely con-
tinuum approach. The added value of the mesoscopic
approach here proposed consists in the possibility to di-
rectly compute the density proﬁle, and its dependency on
the underlying wall-ﬂuid and ﬂuid-ﬂuid physics. To this
purpose, we consider the momentum balance equation in
(4) for the direction normal to the wall, i = y. Since
uy = 0, we simply obtain ∂yP = 0, i.e.

s∂yρ − 2Gb(1 − e−ρ)e−ρ∂yρ − Gwρe−y/ξ = 0.

Let us ﬁrst study the eﬀects of the wall in (9) by set-
ting Gb = 0. One can easily obtain log(ρ(y)/ρw) =
ξGw
(1−exp(−y/ξ)), which enables us to estimate ∆ρw =

FIG. 2:
Increase of the mass ﬂow rate with the coupling
strength Gb of ﬂuid-ﬂuid bulk interactions. Fixing the wall
correlation function ξ = 2, we plot the mass ﬂow rate (Qef f )
normalized to its Poiseuille value (Qpois) as a function of Gb
for diﬀerent values of Gwall: Gwall = 0.0 (◦), Gwall = 0.04 ((cid:3)),
Gwall = 0.08 (×). Inset: same as the main ﬁgure for ∆ρw/ρ.

We now turn our attention to the non trivial interference
between bulk and wall physics whenever Gb > 0. Deﬁning
the bulk pressure as: Pb = c2
2 Gb(1 − exp(−ρ))2, we
can rewrite equation (9) to highlight its physical content
as follows:

Equation (11) highlights two results. First, the eﬀect of
the bulk can always be interpreted as a renormalization
of the wall-ﬂuid interaction by

GR
w ≡ Gw/

∂Pb
∂ρ

.

(13)

Second, as it is evident from (13), one must notice that
near the bulk critical point where ∂Pb/∂ρ → 0, the renor-
malizing eﬀect can become unusually great.
In other
words, the presence of the wall may locally push the sys-
tem toward a phase transition even if the bulk physics it
is far from the transition point. As a result, the eﬀective
slip length in presence of both wall and bulk non-ideal
interactions can be estimated as:

λs ∼ ξ exp(ξGR
w )

(14)

In Fig. 1 we show ρ(y) for diﬀerent values of Gb and
Gw = 0.03, ξ = 2 as obtained by numerically in-
tegrating equations (1-3). The numerical simulations
have been carried out by keeping ﬁxed the value of

FIG. 3: Momentum proﬁle as a function of the channel height.
We plot the momentum proﬁle (ρux) normalized to its center
channel value ((ρux)c) as a function of the distance from the
wall (y) normalized to the channel height (Ly). The results
of numerical simulations ((cid:3)) with Gb = 3.5, Gw = 0.08 and
ξ = 2 are compared with the analytical estimate (continuous
line) obtained solving equations (9) and (6). To highlight the
rarefaction eﬀect, the parabolic ﬁt in the center channel region

center of the channel and the wall increases, as predicted
by equation (9). Consequently, the mass ﬂow rate in-
creases as shown in Fig. 2. Let us notice in the same
ﬁgure that also with Gw = 0, the wall initiates a small
rarefaction eﬀects due to the fact that ﬂuid particles close
to the boundary are attracted only by particles in the
bulk of the channel. What we showed here is that the
combined actions of Gw and Gb → Gc

crease the formation of this less dense region in the prox-

imity of the surface. For a quantitative check, we have
numerically integrated equations (9) and (6) for a given
value hρi = log(2). The analytical estimate for ρux is
compared with the numerical results in Fig. 3. This is
a stringent test for our analytical interpretation. The
result is that the analytical estimate is able to capture
the deviations from a pure parabolic proﬁle at approach-
ing the wall region, where rarefaction eﬀects are present.
The crucial point in our analysis is that, even for very
small Gw, large apparent slip can occur in the channel if
Gb is close to its critical value, i.e. the limit Gw → 0 and
Gb → Gc
b do not commute. For example, let us consider
b − ǫ3,
the case when Gw ∼ ǫ ≪ 1, ξ ∼ ǫ and Gb ∼ Gc
we obtain ∂Pb
∂ρ ∼ ǫ3 and therefore, equation (14) predicts
that λs ∼ O(1) for ǫ → 0. The wall eﬀect, parametrized
by Gw and ξ, can act as a catalyzer in producing large
apparent slip. Most of the results shown in Figs. (1) and
(2) are in close agreement with the MD numerical sim-
ulations [4, 5, 7, 8]. Our analysis points out that, close
to the wall, one can observe a “local phase transition”
triggered by the presence of the wall itself. In summary,
we have shown that a suitable form of the Lattice Boltz-
mann Equation can be proposed in order to simulate ap-
parent slip in microchannel. Slip boundary conditions
arise spontaneously because, close to the wall, a “gas”
layer is formed. If the system is close to a state where
coexistence of diﬀerent phases (liquid and gas) are ther-
modynamically achievable, then, macroscopic slip eﬀects
can result. We have shown that for large scale separation,
the model reduces to a continuum set of hydrodynamical
equations which explains the qualitative and quantita-
tive behavior of the mass ﬂow rate in terms of the model
parameters, i.e. Gb and Gw.

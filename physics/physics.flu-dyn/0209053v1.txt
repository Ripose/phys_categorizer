Abstract

The compressibility and heat of reaction inﬂuence on the scalar mixing in decaying isotropic turbulence

and homogeneous shear ﬂow are examined via data generated by direct numerical simulations (DNS).

The reaction is modeled as one-step, exothermic, irreversible and Arrhenius type. For the shear ﬂow

simulations, the scalar dissipation rate, as well as the time scale ratio of mechanical to scalar dissipation,

are aﬀected by compressibility and reaction. This eﬀect is explained by considering the transport equation

for the normalized mixture fraction gradient variance and the relative orientation between the mixture

fraction gradient and the eigenvectors of the solenoidal strain rate tensor.

Introduction

Recent studies of scalar mixing in incompressible turbulence (e.g. Overholt & Pope 1996; Jaberi et al. 1996;

Slessor, Bond & Dimotakis 1998; Livescu, Jaberi & Madnia 2000) have enhanced our understanding of the

mixing mechanism, the behavior of the scalar PDF and the evolution of scalar moments. However, funda-

mental studies of scalar mixing in compressible turbulence are scarce. Blaisdell, Mansour & Reynolds (1994)

show that the dilatational velocity has negligible contribution to the scalar ﬂux in homogeneous turbulence.

It is not clear, however, how the compressibility aﬀects the scalar moments or the scalar dissipation. A

better understanding of the compressibility eﬀects is important in the analysis of the combustion processes.

The main objective of this work is to study the inﬂuence of compressibility and heat release on the evolution

of the scalar dissipation rate in homogeneous turbulence.

2 Numerical methodology and DNS parameters

In order to assess the inﬂuence of compressibility on the mixing process, direct numerical simulations (DNS)

of decaying isotropic and homogeneous sheared turbulence are performed under reacting (heat - releasing)

and nonreacting conditions. In the nonreacting cases a passive scalar is simulated along with the turbulent

ﬁeld. The compressible form of continuity, momentum, energy and species mass fractions transport equations

are solved using the spectral collocation method. In the reacting cases, the chemical reaction is modeled by

a one-step irreversible Arrhenius-type reaction. In order to assess the inﬂuence of heat of reaction on the

mixing process, the statistics pertaining to the mixture fraction Z are extracted from the two reacting scalar

ﬁelds and compared to those obtained for a passive scalar in the nonreacting cases. The viscosity varies with

the temperature according with a power law and Le = 1 in all cases.

For the shear ﬂow simulations, the velocity ﬂuctuations are initialized as a random solenoidal, three-

dimensional ﬁeld with Gaussian spectral density function (with the peak at k0v = 10) and unity rms.

The initial pressure ﬂuctuations are evaluated from a Poisson equation (except for the high Mach number

case for which they are set to zero). For the decaying isotropic simulations the initialization proposed by

Ristorcelli & Blaisdell (1997) is employed. The variables are then allowed to decay until they develop realistic

turbulence ﬂuctuations before the scalars are initialized. This corresponds to time t = 0 on all ﬁgures. The

value of the Reynolds number at t = 0 is Reλ0 = 50. The simulations are stopped at t/τt = 14.4 such that

the scalar variance becomes two orders of magnitude less than the initial value. For the shear ﬂow cases
Reλ0 = 21 initially, and increases to values between 93 − 110 in the direction of the mean velocity at the

end of the simulations. The shear ﬂow simulations are stopped between 18 < St < 20, such that the integral

scales remain small compared to box size and the Kolmogorov microscale is larger than the grid size. This

corresponds to t/τt in the range 10.4 to 11.5.

The scalar ﬁelds are initialized as “random blobs”, with double-delta PDFs (Overholt & Pope, 1996). The

initial length-scale of the scalar ﬁeld is controlled by changing the location, k0s, of the peak of the Gaussian

spectrum used to generate the scalar ﬁeld. The variables are time advanced in physical space using a second

order accurate Adams-Bashforth scheme. The code developed for this work is based on a fully parallel

algorithm and uses the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI).

In order to examine the compressibility eﬀects on the scalar mixing, cases with diﬀerent initial value of the

turbulent Mach number, Mt0, are considered. The heat release eﬀects are investigated by varying the values

of the heat release parameter, Ce, computational Damk¨ohler number, Da, and the initial lengthscale of the

scalar ﬁeld. All reacting cases have the value of the Zeldovich number, Ze = 8. Table 1 summarizes the

cases considered for this study. The isotropic turbulence cases are labeled with i and the shear ﬂow cases
with s. For the shear ﬂow cases the value of the initial nondimensional mean shear rate, S∗

, where

The reaction parameters chosen for the cases considered mimic the combustion of a typical hydrocarbon in

air at low to moderate values of Reynolds number. For all reacting cases presented most of the reaction

occurs between 2 < St < 8 and the reaction rate peaks between 4 < St < 6.

3 Results

In the absence of a mean scalar gradient, the transport equation for the mixture fraction variance,

does not have a production term and

the mixture fraction variance is normalized by

fraction dissipation rate, ǫZ = 1

Z ′′Z ′′ decays continuously. Furthermore, if the transport equation for
Z ′′Z ′′ then the right hand side is proportional to the mixture

passive and reactive turbulent scalar ﬁelds. For all cases considered ǫZ increases initially as the turbulence

to decay. For the isotropic turbulence cases our results indicate a slight dependence of ǫZ on Mt0 . However,

for the shear ﬂow simulations, ﬁgure 1(a) shows that the values of ǫZ decrease as Mt0 increases. Since for

the nonreacting cases the variation of the viscosity is small, the decrease in ǫZ with Mach number can be
associated with the decrease in the normalized mixture fraction gradient variance, ξ =< ∇Z ′′·∇Z ′′ > /
Z ′′Z ′′.

This is in agreement with the results obtained for forced isotropic turbulence by Cai, O’Brien & Ladeinde

g

(1998). In the presence of heat release, ǫZ increases its magnitude during the time when the reaction is

signiﬁcant (ﬁgure 1b). A further increase in the values of ǫZ is obtained by increasing Ce or Da. However,

for the reacting cases, our results indicate that the values of ξ decrease due to the reaction. Therefore, the

increase in ǫZ can be associated with the signiﬁcant enhancement of the molecular transport properties due

to the heat of reaction. By increasing the value of k0s (case s9) the initial length scale of the scalar ﬁeld

3

becomes smaller, which results in higher values of ǫZ compared to other cases.

Figure 1: a) Mach number and b) heat release inﬂuence on the evolution of the mixture fraction dissipation
rate.

The scalar dissipation rate is usually modeled by assuming that the ratio, CZ = 2K/ǫ
1/ǫZ

, of the time scale

of mechanical dissipation to that of the mixture fraction variance dissipation is constant, although there is

much evidence that it does not take a universal value (Livescu, Jaberi & Madnia 2000). Figure 2 shows that

for the isotropic turbulence cases CZ varies in time initially and seems to asymptote to a constant at long

time. Similar with the results obtained for the mixture fraction dissipation rate, CZ is slightly aﬀected by

the change in Mt0 for the cases considered. For comparison, also shown are the corresponding values of CZ

obtained using the model of Xu, Antonia & Rajagopalan (2000). The model assumes local isotropy, and the

prediction plotted in ﬁgure 2 does not take into account the intermittency of the small scales. The values of

CZ become close to the model prediction at late times.

Both Mt0 and heat of reaction inﬂuence the values of CZ in the shear ﬂow simulations (ﬁgure 3). For the

nonreacting cases, CZ decreases as Mt0 increases (ﬁgure 3a). At early times this is due to an ampliﬁcation

of the viscous dissipation rate, ǫ/K, and a decrease in ǫZ. At later times ǫ/K has lower values at higher

Mt0, which explains the change in the slope of CZ observed in ﬁgure 3(a). For the reacting cases the viscous

dissipation rate increases signiﬁcantly during the time when reaction is important. This increase is larger

than the increase in ǫZ, and CZ becomes less than in the nonreacting case (ﬁgure 3b).

It is explained above that the normalized mixture fraction gradient, decreases at higher values of Mt0 or in

the presence of heat release. This behavior is further examined by considering the transport equation for

the normalized variance of the mixture fraction gradient:

is the

dilatation. The ﬁrst two terms in equation 2 are production terms, due to the mean shear and solenoidal

strain rate, respectively, terms III and IV are explicit dilatational terms and the last term is the molecular

dissipation. For both reacting and nonreacting cases considered the explicit dilatational terms are found to

be much smaller than the rest of the terms in equation 2, and will not be shown.

Figure 4 shows that for isotropic turbulence the two important terms in equation 2 (terms II and V), and

therefore the rate of change of ξ, are slightly aﬀected by the change in Mt0.

For the shear ﬂow simulations, term I, production due to the mean shear is also important (ﬁgure 5).
However, for the value of S∗

0 considered for this study, this term is smaller than term II. Unlike the isotropic

cases, for the shear ﬂow cases Mt0 has a strong inﬂuence on the evolution of the terms in equation 2 (ﬁgure

5a). The production terms and the dissipation term decrease their values signiﬁcantly as Mt0 increases.

However, the decrease in the viscous dissipation term leads to an increase in the values of ξ. Therefore, the

reduction in ξ at higher Mt0 is due to a decrease in the production terms, primarily due to the reduction

of term II. Similarly, all terms in equation 2 decrease their values for the reacting cases as compared to the

nonreacting case (ﬁgure 5b). Nevertheless, during the time when the reaction is signiﬁcant, the reduction in

the production terms (mainly term II) is responsible for the decrease in ξ.

The results presented suggest that the reduction in the values of ξ (and hence ǫZ for the nonreacting cases)

can be associated mainly to a decrease in the production due to the solenoidal strain. This term is dependent

on the relative orientation between the mixture fraction gradient and the solenoidal strain rate tensor, the

magnitude of the corresponding eigenvalues and the mixture fraction gradient variance. For compressible

isotropic turbulence, Jaberi, Livescu & Madnia (2000) showed that the scalar gradient tends to align with

the most compressive eigenvector of the strain rate tensor, similar with the behavior observed earlier in

incompressible turbulence (Ashurst et al. 1987). Our results indicate that this alignment is also obtained

with the solenoidal part of the strain rate tensor and it does not change signiﬁcantly with increasing Mt0.

However, for the shear ﬂow simulations the PDF of the cosine of the angle between ∇Z ′′ and the γ-eigenvector

of ss peaks at a value diﬀerent than 1, indicating a most probable distribution towards an angle diﬀerent than
zero (ﬁgure 6). χ1, χ2, and χ3, are angles between ∇Z ′′ and the α-, β-, and γ-eigenvectors, respectively.

These eigenvectors correspond to the eigenvalues labeled using the usual convention α > β > γ. For a

homogeneous ﬂow, < α > + < β > + < γ >= 0. Since < α >> 0, it has a negative contribution to the

magnitude of the production term (term II in equation 2), while < γ > has a positive contribution. For

all cases considered < β >> 0 and it is small compared to < α > and < γ >. As the initial turbulent

Mach number increases, the peak of the PDF of cos χ3 moves to smaller values, so the alignment worsens

(ﬁgure 6a), contributing to a decrease in the production term. Furthermore, the peak of the PDF of cos χ1

tends to occur at higher values as Mt0 increases, so that the alignment with the most dilatational eigenvalue

improves, further decreasing the production term. Moreover, all three eigenvalues of the solenoidal strain

rate tensor decrease their magnitude at higher Mt0 and it can be shown that this eﬀect also contributes to

the decrease in the production term.

For the reacting cases, near the time when the reaction rate peaks, the alignment between ∇Z ′′ and the

γ-eigenvector improves slightly (the peak of the PDF of cos χ3 moves to higher values), which has a positive

contribution to the production term (ﬁgure 6b). Later, the alignment becomes close to that obtained for the

nonreacting cases. However, the decrease in the magnitudes of the eigenvalues is more signiﬁcant and the

production term has smaller values than in the nonreacting case.

4 Conclusion

DNS of compressible homogeneous turbulent shear ﬂow and isotropic decaying turbulence are performed

under reacting (heat releasing) and nonreacting conditions to examine the role of compressibility and heat

release on the scalar mixing. For the reacting cases the chemical reaction is modeled as one step, irreversible,

and Arrhenius type. The statistics pertaining to the mixture fraction are extracted from the reacting scalars

and compared to those obtained for a passive scalar in the nonreacting cases.

For the range of Mt0 examined, it is found that the mixture fraction dissipation rate is less sensitive to the

changes in Mt0 in isotropic turbulence than in shear ﬂow. For the shear ﬂow cases ǫZ is strongly aﬀected by

compressibility and it decreases as Mt0 increases. Although ǫZ increases for the reacting cases during the

time when the reaction is important, this is primarily due to the increase in the viscosity. Similar with the

Mach number eﬀect, the mixture fraction gradient variance decreases for the reacting cases. The mechanical

to scalar dissipation time scale ratio is also dependent on Mt0 in shear ﬂow, unlike the isotropic turbulence

where the dependence was found to be weak.

The transport equation for the normalized mixture fraction gradient variance was examined and was found

that the explicit dilatational terms are much smaller than the other terms in the equation. For the shear

ﬂow simulations, the mixture fraction gradient variance decreases with Mach number primarily due to a

misalignment between the mixture fraction gradient and the eigenvectors of the solenoidal strain rate tensor,

and also a decrease in the magnitudes of the corresponding eigenvalues. However, for the reacting cases the

normalized scalar gradient variance decreases mainly due to a reduction in the eigenvalues of the solenoidal

strain rate tensor.

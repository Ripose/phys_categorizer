Abstract

A spatially local stability analysis is reported for the cylinder wake at Reynolds numbers 190 and

260. The two three-dimensional instabilities at these Reynolds numbers are shown to be driven by

the ﬂow just behind the cylinder.

Consider the von K´arm´an vortex street generated by ﬂow past an inﬁnitely long circular

cylinder. This ﬂow is time periodic and two dimensional for Reynolds numbers between

approximately 47 and 189 [1, 2, 3, 4]. (The Reynolds number is Re ≡ U∞d/ν, where U∞ is

the ﬂuid velocity far from the cylinder, d is the cylinder diameter, and ν is the kinematic

viscosity.) At Reynolds number 189 the 2D vortex street becomes three dimensionally

unstable [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. A numerical stability analysis of the ﬂow up to Reynolds number

300 has determined two separate bands of linearly unstable modes [5]. The ﬁrst appears

at Re = 189 with a spanwise wavelength of 4 cylinder diameters and the second appears

at Re = 260 with a spanwise wavelength of 0.8 diameters. These linear instabilities are

related to 3D shedding modes known as mode A and mode B, ﬁrst observed experimentally

by Williamson [3].

In this paper I revisit the stability analysis of the vortex street.

I show that small

regions of the full ﬂow just behind the cylinder are responsible for the 3D linear instabilities

despite the fact that the actual linear modes extend many cylinder diameters downstream

of the cylinder. This is important for two separate reasons. The ﬁrst is that this limits

the regions which should be analyzed either to clarify instability mechanisms or to suppress

the instabilities if so desired. The second reason is that the stability analysis of small ﬂow

regions is computationally very eﬃcient compared with a stability analysis of the full ﬂow

ﬁeld. Thus this approach provides a method for quickly obtaining approximate stability

information about a complex ﬂow.

The computational approach is described fully elsewhere [5]. I summarize brieﬂy the main

points with focus on the important aspects for the current work. First direct simulations

of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are used to obtain 2D, time-periodic wake

ﬂows: U(x, y, t + T ) = U(x, y, t) where T is the wake period. A spectral-element method

is employed on a computational domain shown in Fig. 1. The length scale is the cylinder

diameter. The size of the computational domain depends on the Reynolds number and the

accuracy required [5]. The domain shown gives suﬃciently accurate results for the purposes

of this work.

The boundary conditions imposed for the computation of U are as follows. On the top,

bottom, and left boundaries uniform ﬂow is imposed U = (U, V ) = (1, 0). At the right edge

FIG. 1: Spectral-element computational mesh. The base ﬂow is computed on the full domain and

stability computations are performed on the full domain and on a variety of sub-domains. The

sub-domain outlined in bold and shown as an enlargement has inﬂow length Li = 1.5, outﬂow

length Lo = 4, and cross-stream height Ly = 1.5.

a (Neumann) outﬂow boundary condition for the velocity and pressure P is used:

∂U/∂x = 0,

∂V /∂x = 0, P = 0.

(1)

No-slip conditions are imposed at the cylinder surface.

The next step is a Floquet stability analysis of 3D disturbances to the 2D wake. This
analysis is based on the evolution of inﬁnitesimal 3D perturbations u′(x, y, z, t) of the 2D ﬂow

U(x, y, t). The equation for such a perturbation is obtained by linearizing the Navier–Stokes

equations about U:

∇2u′,

where p′ is the perturbation to the pressure that enforces ∇ · u′ = 0.

In this work I shall primarily consider Eq. (2) posed on sub-domains such as that il-

lustrated in Fig. 1. These sub-domains are characterized by their inﬂow and outﬂow

lengths Li and Lo, measured with respect to the cylinder center, and their cross-ﬂow range

−Ly ≤ y ≤ Ly. The base ﬂow U appearing in Eq. (2) is obtained by restricting the base

ﬂow from the full domain to the appropriate sub-domain.

Boundary conditions on u′ are required by Eq. (2). Consider the standard case in which
u′ is computed on the same domain as U. Then the requirement that U+u′ satisfy the same
boundary conditions as U gives homogeneous boundary conditions on u′: u′ = (0, 0, 0) on
all domain boundaries except the outﬂow boundary where u′ satisﬁes the analogy of Eq. (1).

One can view these boundary conditions as the requirement that the perturbation be zero

at the inﬂow and lateral boundaries of the domain but that perturbations can advect out

of the domain. Based on this reasoning we impose these homogeneous boundary conditions
when computing u′ on sub-domains. We are interested in examining perturbations u′ which

are zero on all boundaries of the sub-domain except the outﬂow boundary. Perturbations

are allowed to advect out of the sub-domain.

From the linearized equations the spectrum of Floquet multipliers µ and corresponding

Floquet modes ˜u can be found [5]. Exponentially growing perturbations correspond to

multipliers outside the unit circle in the complex plane (|µ| > 1). Because the geometry is

homogeneous in the spanwise direction, Floquet modes decouple in spanwise wavenumber β.

The Floquet multipliers are thus computed as a function of β on a number of sub-domains

for Re = 190 and Re = 260, just above the critical Reynolds numbers for the 3D instabilities.

Figure 2 summarizes the study in terms of multiplier spectra while Figs. 3-4 shows rep-

resentative Floquet modes. A large number of sub-domains have been studied but only

representative cases are shown near the minimum dimensions necessary to capture the 3D

instabilities.

Figure 2 primarily demonstrates the eﬀect of outﬂow length Lo on the Floquet multiplier

spectrum. The inﬂow length and cross-stream height are ﬁxed at minimal values of Li = 0

and Ly = 1.5. One sees that Lo = 3 is suﬃcient to capture destabilizing Floquet mode.

Increasing Lo further has minimal eﬀect. For Re = 190, decreasing Lo to 2.25 causes a

substantial change to the spectrum – the sub-domain is evidently too small to capture all

the relevant ﬂow features which drive the instability. In the case of Re = 260, decreasing Lo

to 2.25 causes only a small change to the spectrum and the sub-domain is essentially still

large enough to capture relevant ﬂow features. Decreasing the outﬂow length to Lo = 1.5

causes the spectrum in both cases to deviate wildly from the correct behavior (at Re = 260

the multipliers become complex with large magnitude and cannot be plotted on the scale of

Fig. 2). Figs. 3-4 shows just how well the Floquet modes are captured by the sub-domain

computations even though the Floquet mode on the full domain extends far downstream of

the cylinder [5].

Increasing the inﬂow length Li has some eﬀect on the spectrum of multipliers in the

case of Re = 190. However, the eﬀect is very small at the critical wavenumber where the

multiplier branch has largest magnitude. Increasing the inﬂow length has almost no eﬀect

in the case Re = 260. Increasing the cross-stream height has very little eﬀect in either case.

It is possible, in fact, that the cross-stream height could be reduced slightly from that used

here without compromising the accuracy of the multipliers.

Finally, it is worth considering the stability of the downstream portion of the ﬂow. In this

case the base ﬂow is projected onto the sub-domain with 2.25 ≤ x ≤ 25 and −4 ≤ y ≤ 4.

Both at Re = 190 and Re = 260 the ﬂow in this downstream region is found to be very

stable. The maximum modulus of the Floquet multipliers are |µ| ≃ 0.28 at Re = 190,

β = 1.6 and |µ| ≃ 0.19 at Re = 260, β = 7.5.

In this paper I have shown how a local Floquet stability analysis of small regions of the

wake just behind a cylinder are suﬃcient to capture both 3D instabilities observed in wake

transition. The speciﬁc results are of interest for future attempts to understand better the

mechanisms of 3D transition [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] because the results set limits to the regions

which could drive the instabilities. The general method is of interest for future computational

studies of ﬂow instabilities.

computed on the full domain. Insets show modes computed on the sub-domains indicated. (The

inﬂow boundary Li = 0 and the lateral boundaries Ly = 1.5 are the same for all sub-domains.) All

modes are plotted as spanwise vorticity contours at the same ﬁxed time. The spanwise vorticity

contours ±0.4 of the base ﬂow are also plotted.

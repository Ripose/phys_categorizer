A form for the two-point third order structure function has been calculated for three dimensional
homogeneous incompressible slowly rotating turbulent ﬂuid. It has been argued that it may pos-
sibly hint at the initiation of the phenomenon of two-dimensionalisation of the 3D incompressible
turbulence owing to rotation.

INTRODUCTION

With possible realistic applications to ﬂows in oceans
and atmospheres, rotating turbulence attracts interests
of oceanographers, geophysicists, mathematicians and
physicists alike. Rotation seems to be serving as a bridge
between 2D, quasi-2D and 3D turbulences, a fact well-
established with the discovery of two-dimensionalisation
of 3D turbulence due to rotation.

In the steady non-turbulent ﬂow, for low Rossby num-
ber (Ro = U/2LΩ) and high Reynolds number (Re =
U L/ν), Taylor-Proudman theorem[1] argues that rota-
tion two-dimensionalises the ﬂow. This argument is of-
ten mistakenly extended to turbulent ﬂows to explain the
rotation induced two-dimensionalisation arising therein.
The two-dimensionalisation of the 3D turbulent ﬂow in
presence of rotation has begun to be understood as a
subtle non-linear eﬀect which is distinctly diﬀerent from
Taylor-Proudman eﬀect.

Cambon et al.[2] showed that in the presence of rota-
tion, the transfer of energy from small to high wavenum-
bers is inhibited; at the same time, the strong angular
dependence of this eﬀect leads to a draining of the spec-
tral energy from the parallel to the normal wave vectors
(w.r.t. the rotation axis) showing a trend towards two-
dimensionalisation.

Waleﬀe[3] used helical decomposition of the velocity
ﬁeld to study the nature of triad interactions in homo-
geneous turbulence and coupling it with the instability
assumption predicted a transfer of energy toward wave
vectors perpendicular to the rotation axis under rapid
rotation. The helical decomposition turns out to be very
handy to deal with rapidly rotating turbulent ﬂow. In
that case the linear eigensolutions of the problem, the so-
called inertial waves, have the structure of helical modes.
The assumption about the triadic transfers, coupled with
resonance condition for non-linear interaction between
inertial waves, show that there will be a tendency to-

Simulations by Smith et al.[4] speak volumes for the
two-dimensionalisation eﬀect. They showed the coexis-
tence of inverse cascade (a typical feature of 2D turbu-
lence) and forward cascade in forced rotating turbulence
within a periodic box of small aspect ratio. In the simu-
lations, the ratio of the mean rates of energy dissipated
to the energy injected decreased almost linearly, for Ro
less than a critical value, with decrease in Ro (increase
in angular velocity

Although recent experiments by Baroud et al.[5, 6]
and Morize et al.[7, 8] have shed some light on the two-
dimensionalisation eﬀect, the scaling of two-point statis-
tics and energy spectrum in rotating turbulence remains
a controversial topic. Zhou[9] in analogy with MHD tur-
k−2 for
bulence proposed an energy spectrum E(k)
rapidly rotating 3D turbulent ﬂuid and this does seem
to be validated by some experiments[5, 6] and numerical
simulations[10–13]. But some experiments[7] do not tally
with this proposed spectrum. They predict steeper than
k−2 spectrum and this again seem to be drawing some
support from numerical results[14, 15] and analytical re-
sults found using wave turbulence theory[16, 17].

To be precise, if one wishes angular velocity to become
a relevant parameter in constructing the energy spectrum
E(k), simple dimensional analysis would lead one to:

3m

where m is a real number. m should be restricted within
the range 5/3 to 3 to keep the exponents of Ω and ε in
relation (1) positive. The two limits m = 5/3 and m = 3
corresponds to isotropic homogeneous 3D turbulence and
2D turbulence respectively. The spectrum due to Zhou –
k−2 – is due an intermediate value of m = 2. So,
E(k)
as far as the present state of the literature on rotating
turbulence goes, two-dimensionalisation of 3D turbulence
would mean the dominance of a spectrum which goes to-
k−3 and which may choose to settle at
wards E(k)
E(k)

k−2, an issue yet to be fully resolved.

∼

These all studies are for low Ro high Re limit while
high Ro high Re limit has been rather less ventured in
relation to two-dimensionalisation of turbulence. Now,

∼

the two-point third order correlation function (S3) in ho-
mogeneous isotropic turbulence has a rare non-trivial ex-
act result. In this paper we have studied the two-point
third order correlation function (S3) in this latter regime
of high Ro high Re and went on to argue that a spectrum
which goes as k−2.87 (i.e., in between k−2 and k−3) exists
k−5/3
although dominated by the 3D spectrum E(k)
the reason for which of course is that we are dealing with
low rotation limit. This obviously hints at the initiation
of the two-dimensionalisation eﬀect with slow rotation.

∼

Also, if one goes by the procedure given in the book by
Frisch[18] to derive the form of the correlation function
in d-D turbulence with the assumption of forward energy
cascade, one would land up on[19]:

not S3 = (3/2)εl because the calculation doesn’t take
into account the conservation of enstrophy which causes
the reverse cascade of energy[20, 21].
If, using calcu-
lations of structure functions, in the limit of high Ro
and high Re, one wishes to see whether a trend towards
two-dimensionalisation of 3D homogeneous isotropic tur-
bulence occurs or not, then basically one would have to
check if S3 =
(4/5)εl for 3D turbulence shows a tilt to-
−
(3/2)εl for the 2D turbulence. As we shall
wards S3 =
show here, in the lowest order calculation this is what
one may get, again hinting at the initiation of the eﬀect
of two-dimensionalisation of 3D turbulence owing to the
small anisotropy induced by slow rotation.

II. RELEVANT SCALES IN ROTATING
TURBULENCE

l2/ν (diﬀusion time scale).

Let us look in to the various length scales that have
to be taken into consideration while talking about a ho-
mogeneous rotating turbulence. Various parameters to
be considered are: ν (kinematic viscosity), ε (ﬁnite mean
rate of dissipation of energy per unit mass), Ω (angu-
lar velocity) and l0 (integral scale which typically is the
system-size). The three important time-scales involved
ε−1/3l2/3 (eddy-turnover time or
in the system are: tl ∼
Ω−1
circulation time for the eddy of scale l; l
≤
It is well-known
and td ∼
(ε/Ω3) is what responsible for
that a length scale lΩ =
the estimation of the anisotropy introduced by the ro-
tation. The competition between the time-scales tl and
td gives rise to what is known as dissipation length scale
ld, deﬁned as ld = (ν/ε)1/4 and a similar competition
between the time-scales tl and tΩ allows us to deﬁne
(ν/Ω). Now, lets look at the
a length scale lΩd =
typical scenario when Ro is moderate. The four vital
length scales are typically arranged according to the or-
der : l0 > lΩ > lΩd > ld. Thus, the regime l0 > l > lΩ

is the regime where eﬀect of rotation is important and
anisotropy reigns. The scales l
(lΩ, ld) may be con-
sidered to have isotropy, though to be precise, probably
ld here should be replaced by lΩd since rotation seems
to be bringing the eﬀect of viscosity to rather larger
length scales. So, now what happens when the Ro is de-
creased by increasing the angular velocity is interesting.
Both the scales lΩ and lΩd rush towards the dissipation
length scale, thereby increasing the anisotropic regime
(ε/ν) one has
and at the angular velocity Ω = Ωa ≡
lΩ = lΩd = ld and the turbulence is fully anisotropic.

Strictly speaking, even a small rotation introduces
anisotropy (however small) at all scales and the isotropic
regime does have a degree of anisotropy in it as we shall
see in this paper. In the fully anisotropic limit, i.e. for
Ω = Ωa, one expects full decoupling of the plane per-
pendicular to the rotation axis from the direction of the
rotation axis. However, even in the partially anisotropic
limit (e.g. when we have slow rotation imparted on the
turbulent ﬂuid), lz should still be given a special status
for being in the direction of the rotation axis, by which
we mean that the structure functions should no longer
depend on l but rather on lz and ~l⊥ (where l2 = l2
z + l2
and

= Ωz).

⊥

We shall see how this decoupling sets in, in the limit
of low angular velocity and try to study in that very
limit, the two-point third order structure function in
the ﬁrst approximation and see how the eﬀect of two-
dimensionalisation is all set to sneak in with the switch-
ing on of rotation.

III. S3 FOR SMALL Ω

≪

Let us start with low Ω-limit. With this statement we
mean, as discussed in the previous section, Ω
Ωa. So,
the entire ﬂuid may still be treated as isotropic but as
rotation should play a role, we assume that < vivjv′
k >
(where angular brackets mean ensemble average and vi =
vi(~x, t) is the i-th component of velocity and similarly,
i = vi(~x+~l, t)) should depend on ~Ω as well. ~Ω would take
v′
care of the mild anisotropy. Since, physically speaking,
S3 should not depend on which way the rotation axis is
and since we are interested in low values of Ω, we shall
let < vivj v′
k > depend only on the terms quadratic in
Ω and not bother about higher order terms in Ω. As a
result, we write the following most general tensorial form
for < vivj v′

k >:

where lo
i is the i-th component of the unit vector along
~l. We have assumed that the coeﬃcients are dependent

only on l and it is the ~Ω which is taking care of the mild
anisotropy which the turbulent ﬂuid might have. As we
are considering incompressible ﬂuid, we must have:

∂′
kbij,k = 0

(4)

which when applied to relation (3), yields relationships
between various coeﬃcients. Einstien summation con-
vention has been extensively followed in these calcula-
tions unless otherwise speciﬁed. Using relations (3) and
(4), one lands up in the end on the following:

Bijk ≡

Here, prime (“′”) denotes derivative w.r.t.

To get relation (8), we have again made use of the rela-
tion (5). The energy ﬂux through the wave number K
(ΠK ) for the isotropic homogeneous turbulence may be
calculated to be:

ΠK =

(9)

Now if one makes the standard assumption (often made
made during the derivation of S3) that as Re
, the
mean energy dissipation per unit mass ε(ν) tends to a
positive ﬁnite value (i.e., limν→0 ε(ν) = ε > 0), then
limν→0 ΠK = ε in the inertial regime. Therefore, in the
inertial range, putting x = Kl, one has

Now using relations (8), (11) and (12), we form a diﬀer-
ential equation which when solved keeping in mind that
S3 should not blow up at l = 0 one gets following form
for S3 in slowly rotating homogeneous turbulent ﬂuid.

(13)

One may note from the relation (13) that how magically
Ω has brought up the anisotropic eﬀects even for small
Ω though for the entire calculation we followed the pro-
cedure for the homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Thus,
the form for S3 is pausible.

One may ask: does the eﬀect of two-dimensionalisation
shows up in the relation (13)? As one may note from the
relation (13) this is quite a possibility but the only catch
being that J should be negative, an issue which we have
not been able to resolve. If J is negative, it means if we
increase Ω the value of S3 would distort away from the
usual
(4/5)εl for the non-rotating case to more nega-
tive values. This apparently shows a rush of S3 towards
(3/2)εl and hence the tendency of the rotating 3D tur-
−
bulence to show the eﬀect the two-dimensionalisation is
being highlighted. That the sign of J should be negative
is a question remains to be addressed.

−

By the way, the relation (13) also suggests that the
coeﬃcients in the tensorial form for bij,k should have de-
pendence on lz and l⊥ separately eﬀecting a mild decou-
pling of directions. So taking hint from it, we proceed
to rewrite bij,k for slowly rotating 3D turbulent ﬂuid but
now introducing anisotropy directly into the coeﬃcients
and not letting Ω take care of anisotropy explicitly. Of
course, the coeﬃcients will now depend on Ω.

For completely isotropic homogeneous turbulence, one
would write following general form (relation (14)) for bij,k
which is made up of Kronecker delta and components of
the unit vectors ~l/

~l

bij,k = C(l)δij lo
k + D(l)(δiklo
j lo
i lo
+F (l)lo

j + δjklo
i )

(14)

The expression is symmetric in i and j and the coeﬃ-
cients are dependent on l only. As discussed earlier, with
rotation coming into eﬀect, anisotropy comes into eﬀect.
If this eﬀects in the possible decoupling (even if partial)
of the direction along the rotation axis (which we shall
take along the z-axis), then mathematically we may in-
troduce this eﬀect by modifying the form (14) of bij,k to
the following:

k + D(l, lz, Ω)(δiklo
bij,k = C(l, lz, Ω)δij lo

i lo
+F (l, lz, Ω)lo

In arriving at the result (18), we have taken care of the
fact that C can not be allowed to blow up for either for

trivially. So, we are left with the following choice:

to breakdown the arguments used to calculate the S3 of
the relation (33)), the spectrum (35) becomes more and
more prominent; thereby two-dimensionalisation of the
3D homogeneous turbulent ﬂuid is initiated which then
carries over to high rotation regime as is being exten-
sively studied. This signature of two-dimensionalisation
is, of course, in agreement with what present literature
on turbulence hails as the two-dimensionalisation of tur-
bulence.

IV. ENERGY SPECTRUM FOR SMALL Ω

V. CONCLUSION

If we for the time being forget about the issue of
anomalous scaling, then a mere inspection of the rela-
tion (33) from the point of view of dimensional analysis
would tell that in the directions perpendicular to the axis
of rotation, there are two possible energy spectrums viz.

interesting to note that the exponent of k in the relation

ing 3D turbulence as proposed by Zhou). Obviously, the
spectrum (34) will be dominant compared to the spec-
trum (35). But as the Ω is increased (of course, remaining

To conclude, we emphasis on the fact that the
form of two point third order structure function in
a slowly rotating homogeneous 3D turbulence can
strongly hint towards the initiation of the eﬀect of
two-dimensionalisation of 3D turbulence. It barely needs
to be mentioned that the relations are exact (at least
within the approximations made in the calculations)
– something which is worth getting in the literature
of turbulence since it remains barren as far as exact
results are concerned. So any theory developed in the
limit of Ro
, must satisfy the relation
→ ∞
derived in this paper in the limit of low Ω or explicitly
violate the assumptions made to arrive at the result;
in this sense the relation (33) may prove to be of high
importance.

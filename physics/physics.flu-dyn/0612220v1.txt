In pratially all turbulent (cid:29)ows, turbulent energy deay is present and ompetes with numerous

other phenomena. In Kolmogorov's theory, deay proeeds by transfer from large energy-ontaining

sales towards small visous sales through the (cid:16)inertial asade.(cid:17) Yet, this desription annot

predit an atual deay rate, even in the simplest ase of homogeneous isotropi turbulene (HIT).

As empirially observed over 50 years, the steepness of the (cid:16)infrared(cid:17) spetrum(cid:22)at sales larger than

energy-ontaining eddies(cid:22)determines deay, but theoretial understanding is still missing. Here,

HIT deay laws are derived from angular momentum invariane at large sales(cid:22)an approah (cid:28)rst

mentioned by Landau in 1944, but unduly dismissed later. This invariane also predits the so-far

unexplored turbulene deay in layer, tube, and spot zones in a (cid:29)uid at rest. Beyond expanded

and simpli(cid:28)ed theoretial desriptions, these (cid:28)ndings suggest new pratial modeling strategies for

turbulent dissipation, often de(cid:28)ient in applied simulations.

At this point the signi(cid:28)ane of the invariant as given

in Eqs. (5) requires some elaboration: (i) Although the

physial invariant is always the same(cid:22)the angular mo-

depends on an external parameter m whih is not spe-

infrared behavior of E(κ). (ii) A given initial long-range
behavior of f (s) will be preserved at later times aord-

if µ < 3.

SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS

1. Landau's angular momentum invariane at large sales

One starts with the equation of (cid:29)utuating veloity in a zero mean veloity (cid:28)eld (uniform onstant density and

vanishing visosity are assumed)

Angular momentum (cid:29)utuations along z integrated over a (cid:28)xed volume Ω then yield

ρ∂tui + ρ(uiuj),j + p,i = 0.

work, the orientation of the normal vetor element ˆσd
2r anels the z -omponent of the torque produed by pressure
p. Pressure is thus disregarded in all the following.

A time evolution equation for the variane of H Ω

z an then be obtained by a diret substitution of the torque

expression, and aordingly

In this way, the two-point, triple spae-orrelation funtions of veloity an be introdued, in lose similarity with the

usual Kármán(cid:21)Howarth equation in volume integrated form. Now, this derivation, although rigorous and exat, is not

in the spirit of Landau's approah, whih hinges ritially on the argument that the torque beomes asymptotially

negligible at large sales, and the angular momentum asymptotially onstant (one is a surfae integral and the other

a volume integral). In this ase one should instead derive an evolution equation of the angular momentum variane

by integrating the stohasti di(cid:27)erential equation (11) in the weak ollision (or frition) limit(cid:22)just as for Brownian

motion. For asymptotially large Ω the orrelation time of H Ω

z (t) is muh longer than that of T Ω

z (t), and one an

thus write

Here, it was assumed that the spinning assoiated with the angular momentum is small enough so as to produe

negligible shear at the boundary: this avoids far-from-average veloity (cid:29)utuations whih ould signi(cid:28)antly hange

the torque estimate and even produe a orrelation between torque and angular momentum.

In general, expanding T Ω

z T Ω

z shows that the time derivative of H Ω

z H Ω

z now depends on two-point, quadruple spae-

orrelation funtions of veloity. Landau's approah is thus physially distint from Loitsyanskii's, although eventual

invariants may(cid:22)and should(cid:22)oinide in regimes where their respetive approximations are ompatible. Expliit

As shown in Fig. 3, the domains Ω onsidered for angular

momentum onservation at large sales extend somewhat

the motions in the turbulent zone, although they deay

quikly with distane. These veloity (cid:29)utuations ould

ontribute to H Ω

z , despite the fat that H Ω

z is preserved

by Sa(cid:27)man's pro jetion proedure in Eq. (6):

indeed,

Sa(cid:27)man's pro jetion only deals with a pressure gradient

orretion to the impulse (cid:28)eld, but does not involve trans-

port whih is the soure of torque in Eq. (12b). Now, as

simply onneted, or is just onneted but does not arry

ways.

Let d be the distane of the surfae of Ω to the tur-
bulent zone. The veloity (cid:29)utuations at distane d are

given by the potential (cid:28)eld produed by the turbulent

zone in the laminar region, whih sales as (λ/d)3√k or
(λ/d)4√k for a single struture of dipolar or quadrupo-

lar harater respetively (Sa(cid:27)man or Bathelor ases).

As skethed in Fig. 5, the e(cid:27)etive (cid:28)eld at distane d is

the superposition of unorrelated ontributions oming

from strutures within a typial radius d: this yields the

various point ontributions as listed in Table II. Sine

at distane d the (cid:28)eld is produed by turbulent stru-
tures within a typial radius d, veloity (cid:29)utuations are
also orrelated over a typial distane d: this yields the

various surfae integration fators as listed in Table II.

Combining the di(cid:27)erent fators, the relative magnitudes

of the laminar ontributions to T Ω

possible for shapes of rotating (cid:29)uid domains of higher

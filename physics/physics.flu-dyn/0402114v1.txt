ABSTRACT

A one dimensional motion of the Bethe-Johnson gas is studied in a context of
Landau’s hydrodynamical model of a nucleus-nucleon collision. The expressions for
the entropy change, representing a generalization of the previously known results,
are found. It is shown that these expressions strongly depend on an equation of
state for the baryonic matter.

1 INTRODUCTION

The application of special relativistic gasdynamics to some problems in par-
ticle physics goes back to the pioneering work by L.Landau [1] who obtained
the asymptotic solution describing a one-dimensional expansion of a ﬁnite
slab of matter modelled by the ultra-relativistic gas with the adiabatic index
γ = 4/3. Later I.Khalatnikov [2] obtained the exact solution of the same
problem. G.Milekhin [3] extended this solution to an ultra-relativistic gas
with an arbitrary adiabatic index. S.Belenkiy and G.Milekhin [4] applied a
model of the ultra-relativistic shock wave to a problem of an entropy increase
in a high energy nucleus-nucleon collision. A signiﬁcant input into the prob-
lems associated with a hydrodynamical model of nucleus-nucleon collisions
was made by G.Baym [5] who solved the Landau problem [1] for the cylin-
drical geometry. Nonetheless G.Baym and collaborators indicated that there
is a need to use a more realistic equation of state than the one with Γ = 4/3.
Since there is still some uncertainty about an exact form of the equation of
state for the baryonic matter at very high densities, one can consider a wide
range of possible candidates for such an equation.
One of these equations was proposed by H.Bethe and M.Johnson [6] (which
in what follows we call BJ equation), and later it was used to illustrate an
idea of a possible baryon-quark transition [7]. This equation was also used
for a speculation on a potential inﬂuence of such a transition on a collec-
tive ﬂow in a high energy ion collisions [8]. Therefore, it seems reasonable
that a study of one-dimensional motions of Bethe-Johnson gas( including
the original Landau problem) might provide a new insight into high energy
phenomena within a model based on relativistic gasdynamics.

2 SHOCK ADIABATICS OF BJ GAS

We begin by considering a relativistic shock. In what follows we adopt the
units with the speed of light taken to be c = 1. The energy, momentum,
and particle conservation laws across the shock (in the shock frame)yield the
following shock adiabatic [9]

µ1 −

(p1 −

p2)( ˆV1 + ˆV2) = 0

where indices 1 and 2 denote the areas in front and the back of the shock
W 2/2, W = w/n, w = ǫ + p is the enthalpy per unit of
respectively, µ
volume per unit of baryon rest mass, n is the particle density, p is the pressure
per unit of baryon rest mass, ǫ is the energy density per unit of baryon rest
mass,

≡

ˆV = W/n = w/n2

is the generalized ”speciﬁc volume” [10]. In these variables the relativistic
shock adiabatic (1) looks exactly as the Hugoniot adiabatic of a newtonian
gas.

2.1 SOME RELATIONS FOR A RELATIVISTIC SHOCK

We provide a series of relations which follow from the conservation laws across
the shock. From the continuity of particle ﬂux density

and momentum ﬂux density

in exact analogy to the newtonian case.It has turned out that only case a)
can actually occur.

This is easily shown by considering a relativistic weak shock wave, in which
the discontinuity in every quantity is small as compared to the quantity. Let
us expand both sides of the shock adiabatic (1) in powers of small diﬀerences
of entropy(per unit of volume) ∆s

Following the analogous procedure in newtonian gasdynamics, the expansion
in ∆p is to be carried as far as the third order. Thus we obtain:

The generalized ”speciﬁc volume” ˆV = W V needs to be expanded only
in terms of ∆p, since the terms with ∆s contribute to the fourth order of
smallness in ∆p. Thus we get after some algebra:

2.2 SHOCK WAVE IN BJ GAS

(11)

where ν is an arbitrary constant playing the role of the adiabatic index. If
the gas in front of the shock is cold, that is p1 = 0 , equation (11) yields for
that region:

ǫ1 = n1
(12)
which implies µ1 = 1 and hence ˆV1 = V1, that is the conventional speciﬁc
volume.

By substituting Eqs.(11), (12) in the shock adiabatic (1) we obtain the

following equation with respect to p2

We cannot determine the physical branch on the basis of the adiabatic only
, since for both branches the conditions p2 > p1, V2 < V1 [which follow
from the law of entropy increase (8) and Eq.(11)] are satisﬁed in the region

adiabatic speed of sound in the region behind the shock, (cs)2 ( it is obvious
that in the region 1 of the cold gas the speed of sound is 0).

3 ONE-DIMENSIONAL SHOCK WAVE PROP-

AGATION

We consider the following problem [3]: 2 shock waves propagate in opposite
direction in a ”gas cylinder” as shown in Fig.4.

shocks(cid:13)

D(cid:13)

D(cid:13)

d (cid:13)

l(cid:13)

Figure 4: Geometry of 1-dimensional shock waves propagation in the observer
frame of reference

The distance travelled by the left-bound shock is denoted by d and the re-
spective distance travelled by the right-bound shock is denoted by l. A gas
in front of both shocks is assumed to be ”cold”, that is its pressure is p = 0.
A compressed gas is taken to be Bethe-Johnson gas, obeying the equation of
state (11). Initially we choose the frame of reference where the gas between
2 shocks is at rest.

When the shock wave propagating to the left with a velocity D reaches the
left end of the cylinder, there begins an outﬂow of matter. As a result,a
rarefaction wave has been formed which starts to move to the right with the
speed of sound. At this time the shock wave moving to the right with a
velocity D has not yet reached the right end. Therefore the two possibilities
can materialize:

a)the rarefaction wave can catch up and overtake the right-moving shock
wave before it would reach the right end the right end of the cylinder,
or
b)the rarefaction wave will lag behind the right-moving shock wave.

If we use the shock frame of reference ( of the right-bound shock), then the
gas velocity behind it is D, and in front of it is given by (29). We consider a

14

strong shock, that is β1 →
1 which implies that the respective velocity in the
shock frame of reference is also β′1 →
1. Therefore combining the relation
which is obtained by dividing energy and momentum ﬂuxes across the shock
( see [13])

β′1 =

p2 + D2e2
D(p2 + e2)

and the equation of state (11) we obtain the quadratic equation for D whose
solution ( excluding the trivial root D = 1) is

The problem becomes more involved if l/d

former is reﬂected from the latter thus creating the ﬂow region bounded on
one side by the shock wave moving to the right and on the other side by the
reﬂected wave moving to the left. The resulting ﬂow can be described with
the help of the equation for a general one-dimensional motion of a relativistic

Because equation (27) is true for very strong shock waves, even if the particle
number is not conserved, relation (46) remains valid in this case. If we use as
model an ultra-relativistic gas then equation (27) is exact, although it refers
to e2 instead of W2. In addition, the variable y becomes [2]

catches up with the shock wave and t2 is the moment of time when the shock
wave reaches the right end of the ”tunnel” (Fig.5). Since n we consider
a strong shock β2 →
ν. Because the
time interval dt is measured in the shock frame reference the respective time
interval in the observer frame ( where initially both waves, the strong shock
and Riemann’s wave move with a velocity D) is dt/√1
D2. Taking these

Figure 5: Variation of the dimensionless entropy change as a function of the
adiabatic index ν and l/d

given by (64) yields as a particular case the expression found in [4] for ν =
4/3 It is seen that the entropy change in region 2 increases and reaches its
maximum for the values of ν in the range from 1.3 to 1.4. A further increase
of ν results in a sharp decline of the entropy change, approaching the purely
adiabatic regime for the threshold value of ν = 2.

where lm/d is given by (39). From (65) follows that in this case the entropy
change can be positive only if ν > 2. However this also means that the ﬂow
becomes non-causal , since ( as we showed above) in this case βs > 1. There-
fore if δ = 2 the one-dimensional ﬂow of Bethe-Johnson gas with ν < 2 is
characterized by a zero change of entropy when Riemann’s wave catches up
with the shock wave (and stays zero from that moment on), that is the ﬂow
becomes adiabatic. This contrasts with the previous case i) which is a gen-
eralization of the analogous ﬂow for an ultra-relativistic with an arbitrary
adiabatic index ( not necessarily ν = 4/3 as in [4]). In the latter the entropy
change is linear in l/d before Riemann wave catches up with the shock wave,
and obeys the power law for l/d (given by eq.65) after Riemann wave over-

22

takes the shock wave.

The ﬂow described here can be associated with a nucleon-nucleon collision
(cf.[13]) which is modelled as a collision of the nucleon with a cylinder cut
out of the nucleus and whose cross-sectional area is equal to the one of the
nucleus. The nucleus linear size varies from the diameter of the nucleus to
the ”diameter” of the nucleon, d.
It is clear that such an approximation
can be used only to obtain certain estimates about parameters of the real
process, for example to evaluate an entropy change. The ratio l/d is related
to the atomic number A: l/d = A1/3. If we take maxA = 257 this would
give us the maximum value of ν = 1.53 ( according to eq.39)which is close
to the region where entropy change reaches its maximum.

4 CONCLUSION

We found the shock adiabatic for BJ gas and applied the found detailed
relations for a study of a one-dimensional ﬂow of such a gas in a context of
a nucleon-nucleon collision. If baryon matter can be transformed into quark
matter at a certain range of the compression ratio (5
10), then the proposed
model allows one to identify the baryon matter as Bethe-Johnson gas with
the adiabatic index ν
Such an approach generalizes an analogous approach based upon an ultra-
relativistic gas. The latter represents a particular case of BJ gas with adia-
batic index ν = 4/3. The entropy change behind the shock strongly depends
on the choice of the adiabatic index in BJ, by reaching its maximum in the
range of values of ν from 1.3 to 1.4.

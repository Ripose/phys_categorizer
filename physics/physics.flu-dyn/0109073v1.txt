Abstract. The formulation of a model for the evolution of the ﬂow of a solid-liquid mixture (coal-water)
in a horizontal pipeline with partial phase separation is the aim of this work. Problems of instabilities
due to complex eigenvalues, observed in previous models, seem to be completely solved in the present
model, in which we give the genesis of the diﬀerent terms written in the equations, coming from the
natural deﬁnition of mass and momentum balance, and the consequent proof of well-posedness of the
obtained PDE system with boundary-Cauchy data.

The model describes a three-layer ﬂow. Most of the material is carried by the upper layer, while the
bottom layer consists of an immobile sediment. The intermediate layer grows to a maximum thickness
and has the role of regulating the mass exchange between the extreme layers.

In the last section we present some simulations for a particular choice of ﬂow regime, and boundary-

Cauchy data, that were suggested by experimental results provided by Snamprogetti (Fano, Italy).

keywords: suspensions, phase-separation, turbulent ﬂow, hyperbolic, well-posedness

1. The physical problem

In this paper we formulate a mathematical model for the ﬂow in a horizontal pipeline of a solid-water

mixture with a progressive phase separation due to gravity.

The speciﬁc case we have in mind is the one of “dilute” coal-water suspensions and was suggested to

us by Snamprogetti (Fano, Italy). The fresh mixture has a coal concentration of about 50% (in weight)

and a particle size distribution centered at 0.205mm (

1.25mm). The rheological properties of such a

≤

system are totally diﬀerent from the ones of coal-water slurries that have been studied extensively in a

number of papers ([2], [6], [7], [8], [17], [20], [23]).

Indeed slurries, which can have coal concentrations up to 70% and are prepared using smaller particles,

are stable at rest thanks to the action of chemical additives and exhibit partial sedimentation under

stress, mainly because of the presence of impurities that are not aﬀected by the additive and are no

longer sustained by the slurry yield stress in dynamical conditions.

The situation here is completely diﬀerent, because the liquid and solid components tend to separate

under gravity both at rest, and in dynamical conditions.

The approach we are going to follow is in the typical framework of stratiﬁed ﬂows: in any transversal

cross section of the pipe we have three layers, whose motion and composition are described by averaged

quantities.

The upper layer carries most of the material, while the bottom layer is immobile (a stationary deposit

that should be avoided in practice). The middle layer has a density intermediate between the lighter, fast

ﬂowing, upper phase, and the sediment. We suppose that at the beginning just one phase exists, having

the same properties of the material entering the pipeline. Therefore the system goes through a ﬁrst stage

in which there is no immobile layer, while the denser ﬂowing layer grows up to a thickness ∆, depending

on the pipe discharge. Once this value of the thickness is reached, the stationary sediment appears and

the intermediate layer moves upwards, keeping its thickness ∆ and its concentration, and transmitting

solid material from the main phase to the sediment.

The idea of the intermediate layer is inspired to a model that has succesfully explained sedimentation

in slurries (see [5], [16]), although as we said ,the general properties are quite diﬀerent in the two cases.

The scheme utilizing piecewise constant velocities over a cross section, although very convenient and

frequently used in pipeline modeling, is already largely approximated, so that, taking the density constant

in each layer, is not only a reasonable assumption, but it looks the only one really consistent with the

general setting of the problem. In fact, the way density varies, over a cross section, can be measured

by means of a Gamma-Densimeter, however the accuracy is not such that one could look for a more

sophisticated model.

Previous models in the literature describing ﬂows of mixtures (see [4], [13], [15], [18], [19], [20], [21],

[22], [24] ) could not be adapted to our case for diﬀerent reasons1 , so that the model we are going to

illustrate is, as far as we know, an original contribution towards the study of non-steady suspensions

ﬂows with phase separation.

2. The two-layer flow model

Let us deal ﬁrst with the initial stage of the ﬂow in which we have just two layers.

We denote by x the coordinate along the ﬂow. At any section x = const., the two layers occupy two

regions of areas A1 (the upper layer), A2 (the lower), separated by a straight line of length Si. The

1Problems of ill-posedness in [19] were pointed out (see Remark 3.1) in [13], while the stationary models present in
the literature are not interesting in our case, since stationary ﬂow is reached at such large dinstances from the entrance of
the pipeline, that it is not observable in practice. In addition, it would correspond to the situation in which only water is
transported by the main ﬂow, which is of course of no practical use.

perimeters of the outer boundaries are S1, S2, respectively. In the stage we are considering the thickness

of the lower layer is less than ∆ (see ﬁg. 2.1).

Figure 2.1. Two-layer ﬂow model, vertical section

The ﬂow model is based on mass and momentum conservation accounting for the exchange of liquid

and solid between the two layers.

The basic quantities entering the model are, besides A1, A2,

solid volume fraction in layer 1;
solid volume fraction in layer 2;

α:
β:
U : velocity of layer 1;
V : velocity of layer 2.

The solid volume transfer rate from layer 1 to layer 2 will be assumed to be αA1ψ, where ψ is a positive

constant. The corresponding quantity for the liquid component can be written (1

out to be a function of α, β, ψ, as we shall see.

Clearly A1 and A2 are related by:

A1 + A2 = A

Also the two velocities U ,V are not independent, since summing up equations (2.1), (2.2), (2.3), (2.4),

we obtain that the discharge Q along the pipe does not depend on x, as a natural consequence of the

incompressibility of the mixture:

so that Q may depend on t only, thus:

∂x(A1U + A2V ) = 0 ,

V =

The above equations are not enough to describe the evolution of the bottom layer. We assume that the

solid concentration in it is constant, i.e.:

Thus we can divide eq. (2.3) by β and (2.4) by (1

β) and realise that

β = const.

and that (2.3), (2.4) represent the same equation, as well as (2.2) is a consequence of (2.1), (2.3) and

Therefore we reformulate all the prevoius conservation laws using two equations only in the three

unknowns α, A1, U . For instance we can replace A2 and V in (2.3) using the expressions (2.5), (2.7),

and then we can modify (2.1) as follows:

We need one more equation which has to be obtained from the balance of momentum.

Before deriving the missing equation, we deﬁne the average densities ρ1, ρ2 in the two layers:

(ρs and ρw are the densities of the solid and of the liquid components).

While ρ2 is constant, ρ1 varies. From (2.1) and (2.2), we obtain the global volume balance in A1:

after using (2.9). Similarly we have

Note that since DjA1 < 0 for j = 1, 2 and D1ρ1 < 0 (see (2.17)), we have a momentum loss in (2.20)

and a momentum gain in (2.21).

The genesis of the loss and gain terms is the following. Consider the motion of volume element A1dx

of the upper layer. In the time element dt it will transfer the mass element

dx dt to the other

layer, with the corresponding (negative) momentum transfer U D1(ρ1A1), per unit length and unit time.

If we follow the motion of an element A2 dx of the lower layer, it will acquire the volume D2A2 dx dt

in the interval time dt. The corresponding mass increase is obtained multiplying by ρ2 (constant) the

volume accretion, and by U , in order to get the momentum variation. Remember that the matter coming

from the upper layer, had a ﬂow velocity U and that it is slowed down to V after passing the interface.

We can rewrite (2.20) and (2.21) in a more expressive way:

Remark 2.1. The ﬁrst equation says that the “donor” system obeys Newton’s law2.

The second equation says that the accepting system experiences an extra inertia force due to the relative

momentum of the transferred element.

Note that, due to the relative motion of the layers, the mass element

dx dt is distributed
D1(ρ1A1)
|
|

among diﬀerent elements of the lower layer. Similarly, the mass increase ρ2D2A2 dx dt is the sum of the

contribution of diﬀerent elements of the upper layer. Therefore (2.22), (2.23) should not be used to get

the overall momentum balance.

2.2.1. The stress terms. In (2.20), (2.21) we take account of the wall and interface shear stress. Generally

speaking, we introduce wall-speciﬁc shear stress (see [1]):

complementary part −D1ρ1 dt(A1 + D1A1 dt)dx − ρ1D1A1 dt dx (which is O(dt)). The main portion moves according to

(ρ1 + D1ρ1 dt)(A1 + D1A1 dt)D1U = external forces + interaction with the O(dt) portion

which gives (2.22) as dt → 0.

2.2.2. A model for the viscosity. The viscosity of the mixture is related to solid fraction. For this reason

we select a particular behaviour of η(α), considering, on one hand, the typical value of the viscosity

of water (0.01gcm−1s−1), corresponding to α = 0, and, on the other hand, the value of the viscosity

measured for a suspension with solid fraction 0.5, typically 0.35gcm−1s−1 (Snamprogetti). Since the

bottom layer with solid fraction 0.7, is at rest, we impose that viscosity increases considerably beyond

the value 0.5 for α. These considerations suggest the following choice of η(α):

Remark 2.2. The selection above of η(α) is extrapolated from just two experimental data, so that it can

be used to obtain just a qualitative, although quite realistic, description of the system.

Remark 3.1. Ill-posedness of previous models formulated for similar non-steady, multiphase ﬂow,(see

[15]) had already been pointed out in diﬀerent papers (see [13], [18], [24]) where diﬀerent methods to bypass

ill-posedness were proposed, based on the introduction of surface tension terms. Such a procedure, which

would be not applicable to our case, is not necessary in our model which is consistently formulated as a

correct evolution problem in a natural way.

stations) and a typical time-scale t0 so to use non-dimensional variables; the time-scale will be chosen to

Remark 4.1. The reason why the quantity of matter passing from the middle layer to the stationary

deposit is proportional to αA1, and not to the corresponding factor of the middle layer βA2, in (4.5), is

due to the fact that we suppose the thickness ∆ of the middle layer constant . From this it follows that

the transfer rate across the intermediate layer is driven by the trasfer of matter between the upper and

In this way, the mass transfer to the stationary deposit stops, as well as the one from the upper to

middle layer, only when the upper layer is completely empty of solid (α = 0). This is the condition of

Remark 4.2 (On the thickness of the middle and bottom layer). To simplify the equation and without

This assumption can be made without any loss of physical meaning since we know that the presence of

the stationary deposit is a damage for the correct use of the plant. Therefore, in practical applications in

plant, its thickness must be kept below a small fraction of the pipe radius.

4.1. Momentum balance. In the following we will use the same notations as in sec. 2 with the changes

due to the introduction of the stationary deposit, as described in Fig. 4.1.

The momentum exchange will be now between the upper and the middle layer, with exactly the same

terms as before and a term of momentum loss of the middle layer, in favour of the stationary deposit.

SUSPENSION FLOWS IN PIPELINES WITH PARTIAL PHASE SEPARATION

The momentum transferred to the stationary deposit is completely absorbed by the pipe wall. With this

in mind, let us write down the two equations of momentum balance for the layers in motion.

L(u) is negative,

is very close to u = 1, conditions in which we are not interested (see Rem. 4.7 ), corresponding to large

phase separation (see Rem. 4.6), negligible in practical applications.

From asymptotic study (see App. A) we know in fact that v2, after a jump-like behaviour for ξ << 1,

starts increasing, pushed by the faster, less dense, upper phase, but remaining considerably smaller than

Remark 4.6 (On ǫ). It is easy to see that, for a3 << 1,

Remark 4.7. The case in which a3 is not small, like, e.g., in the case of large phase separation, should

be treated diﬀerently and will not be considered in this model. For example in problems of restart, the

pressure gradient, that we considered the same for the two layers in motion, is diﬀerent at diﬀerent levels,

during a transient phase.

5. On the boundary-Cauchy data

In sections 3 and 4.1 we introduced the boundary-Cauchy data. In particular, in theorems 3.1 and

4.1 we imposed constant data on both axes (ξ = 0, τ = 0).

20

ALESSANDRO SPERANZA

It has to be noted that this choice was not the only possible. We chose that at the entrance the

condition of the mixture is, at every time t, the same as it was in the whole pipe at time t = 0.

Note that the regularity of the boundary-Cauchy data inﬂuences the regularity of solution (see [11],

Theorem 2.1, pag 71). In our case, being the functions L and S in (4.36) regular and choosing constant

the boundary-Cauchy data, the solution will be regular too.

Our choice will be therefore:

(5.1)

U0 =



α0




This corresponds to the choice we made of having at time t = 0 and at any t, at the entering cross section,

α0 = 0.5 A0

From eq.

(2.7) we see that in fact V is deﬁned only for A2

To do this we have to take into account the diﬀerent terms in the source function in eq.

6. The numerical results

To evaluate the solution of eq. (4.36) we elaborated a numerical code, based on an explicit approxi-

mation method . Eq. (4.36) is discretised as

(6.1)

u[i + 1][xj]

u[i][xj] = ∆t

L[i][xj]

−

(cid:26)

(u[i][xj]

u[i][xj−1])

−
∆x

+ H[i][xj]

(cid:27)

where we indicate with u[i][xj] the solution of (4.36) evaluted at i

th time step, in the j

th cell of

−

−

the spatial domain.

This ﬁnite diﬀerences method of approximation explicit in time (Euler explicit) with a judicious choice

of the dimension of the cells of the space-time grid, gives good conﬁdence of stability and quite acceptable

approximation, and allows the simulations to be run on a normal PC. In the numerical code we inserted

a control for the dimension of the space-time grid, in order to satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy3

condition (see [14]) during the whole run.

The solution of equation (4.36) can be plotted at diﬀerent time steps as a function of the normalized

distance from the entrance ξ (= x/Lc). We plot, in the graphs below diﬀerent quantities: α, v1 and

1

a1, solutions of (4.36), as well as some important ones, related to the solution vector (U), namely

−
v2, a3.

In Fig. 6.1 we show the result of a simulation of the evolution of the system in 100000 sec., as we

said, in turbulent-turbulent regime. We see the formation of the stationary deposit after the achievement

of the maximum thickness of the middle layer. Here we chose U 0 = 0.5m/s and Lc = 100km, with a

maximum thickness ∆ = 5cm.

(see Fig. 6.2).

In similar conditions, but with a maximum thickness ∆ = 8cm, we do not see any stationary deposit

With the initial velocity U 0 = 2m/s and ∆ = 8cm, again, no stationary deposit is present on a lenght

of 100km (see Fig. 6.3), while the stationary deposit is visible in similar conditions, but with ∆ = 5cm

(See Fig. 6.4). From the above simulations we see the dependence of the deposit upon the thickness,

∆, of the middle layer and upon the input velocity U 0. The stationary deposit is, as we expect, thinner

3The condition states that, given the eigenvalues of the characteristic matrix, λp, and being h (along x) and k (along
t) the dimensions of the cells in the space-time grid, necessary condition for the convergence of an approximate method for
PDE systems, is that:

In the case of the complete system (see sec. 4), we calculate numerically the eigenvalues of the characteristic matrix and

we reject the time steps at which the CFL condition is not satisﬁed. For a detailed discussion on the convergence of this
approximation method, see [10].

We have also the convergence, observed for bigger values of the lenght-scale (out of the physical lenght

of 100km) to an asymptotic solution of steady ﬂow, corresponding to the condition of complete phase

separation. Our model converges then to the steady models found in the literature, in [1],

[20],

[22].

Appendix A. Asymptotic behaviour

We try here to evaluate the behaviour of the solutions of the system of PDE’ s we obtained, in the

vicinity of the origin.

Here we neglect the dependence of the solution upon t, situation that, as we observed in the develop-

ment of the numerical simulations, can be actually reached in a time of the same order of the characteristic

Let us suppose then that, for small x, the solution vector Ω has the expansion:

U = U 0 + h1xm1 + h1

−

kxm

A2 = kxm + k0x

0x V = V 0 + h2xm2 + h2

with m, m1, m2 < 1.

From eq. (2.10), we get

From the conservation of total volume:

Using (A.1) in (A.2), equating the terms of the same power, we get:

For m + m1 > 1, while the case m + m1 < 1 is not possible.

If, in particular,

(A.5)

m + m1 = 1

these conditions change a little in the case m = m1, while nothing changes in the other cases:

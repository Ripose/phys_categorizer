Abstract

Applications of the shell model of turbulence to the case of rapidly rotating bodies
are considered. Starting from the classical GOY model we introduce the Coriolis
force and obtain a ∼ k−2 spectrum for 3D hydrodynamical turbulence for the free
decay regime as well for the regime with external forcing. Additional modiﬁcations
of the GOY model providing a realistic form of the helicity are proposed.

Key words: Shell model, Kolmogorov’s spectrum, force balance, α-eﬀect

1 Introduction

The inﬂuence of rotation on the properties of the hydrodynamical turbulence
is of the great importance. This problem appears in the various geophysical
and astrophysical applications [1] and it requires special treatment. So far the
direct 3D numerical simulations, where implementation of the Coriolis force
is trivial, cannot provide a long enough inertial range of spectrum to reveal
its scaling laws [2], thus diﬀerent approaches are needed.

Though the possibility of transition from 3D-turbulence state to the two-
dimensional turbulence due to rotation was already predicted by Batchelor

many years ago [3], only now is the qualitative description of this processes
developing [4], [5]. Having in mind the similar situation in the MHD tur-
bulence [6], where the magnetic ﬁeld plays the same role as the rotation in
reducing the dimension of the problem, the authors proposed that the Coriolis
force introduces a new characteristic time. This time should be used instead of
the characteristic turn-over time based on the Kolmogorov’s estimate. Then,
instead of Kolmogorov’s −5/3 slope the spectrum will have a −2 slope. It ap-
pears that this approach is in agreement with the direct numerical calculations
[7] and the experiments [8]. The formal simplicity of this phenomenological
approach attracts us to implement it in the more complicated models of tur-
bulence and to check the results for self-consistence. For this aim we use the
well-known homogeneous isotropical GOY shell model (see overview in [9])
and modify it to the case of rotation. The proposed model is tested for the
regimes of the free-decay turbulence and for the regime with external forcing.
We also consider a situation where a non-zero average helicity is generated.
This regime ﬁnds its application in the mean-ﬁeld dynamo problems.

2 Basic equations

The evolution of conductive incompressible liquid (∇ · V = 0), rotating with
the angular velocity Ω, can be described by the Navier-Stokes equation:

Ro

∂V
∂t

 

+ (V · ∇) V

= −∇P + F + E∇2V.

!

Eq.(1) is scaled with the large scale of the body L; velocity V , pressure P
and time t are measured in η/L, ρη2/L2 and L2/η, where η is a magnetic
diﬀusion, ρ is density, Ro = η/2ΩL2 and E = ν/2ΩL2 are the Rossby and
Ekman numbers, respectively and ν is the kinematic viscosity. (This kind of
scaling takes its origin in geodyamo problems [10].) The force F = Fc + f
includes the Coriolis eﬀect:

Fc = −1z × V

(1)

(2)

and a prescribed part f. Here 1z is the unit vector along the axis of rotation.

It is worth to note that, in the limit of the vanishing viscosity and absence of
the external force (f = 0), equation (1) conserves kinetic energy Ek = V 2/2.
For the two-dimensional ﬂow the other integral of motion is the enstrophy
EΩ = (∇ × V)2 and for 3D case the hydrodynamical helicity H = V · (∇ × V)
is conserved (see for details, e.g., [9; 1]).

3 Shell model equations

The idea of the shell model approach is to mimic the original equation (1)
by a dynamical system with nmax complex variables u1, u2, . . . , unmax which
represent the typical magnitude of the velocity on a certain length scale. The
Fourier space is divided into nmax shells and each shell kn consists of a set of
wave vectors k such that k02n < |k| < k02n+1, and thus each shell corresponds
to an octave of the wave numbers. Variable un is the velocity diﬀerence over
length ∼ 1/kn, so that there is one degree of freedom per shell. The coupling
between shells is considered to preserve the main symmetries and properties of
equation (1). Of course, the shell model is a simpliﬁed form of the description of
the turbulence, nevertheless, it is a reasonable tool in the studies of turbulence.
Here and after we will refer to the GOY model [9], which has the form:

where ǫ is a free parameter, ∗ is the complex conjugate.

In the inviscid limit (E → 0) and free forcing (F = 0) equation (3) has two
integrals. The ﬁrst integral is the kinetic energy

Ek =

The other integral is the so-called generalized enstrophy

For ǫ = 5/4 its dimension coincides with dimension of the enstrophy, which is
an integral of motion in 2D problem. That is the reason why ǫ = 5/4 usually is
associated with the two-dimensional space. Cases with ǫ < 1 correspond closer
to the helicity integral and can have diﬀerent sign. In the case of ǫ = 1/2 the
H is equal to the dimension of the hydrodynamical helicity,
dimension of
so this case corresponds to 3D space. It is known that the 3D shell model
can reproduce Kolmogorov’s spectrum ∼ k−5/3. The situation in 2D space
(ǫ = 5/4) is more complicated. Application of an external force at some wave

c

number kf gives rise to two spectral regimes: for k > kf the direct spectrum for
the enstrophy, and the spectrum for the inverse energy cascade with the slope
similar to Kolmogorov’s −5/3 for k < kf . The slope of the inverse cascade
spectrum for enstrophy depends on ǫ and can change its value from −3 for
ǫ = 5/4 to −5/3 for ǫ ≈ 10 [11]. Here and after we will consider only the direct
cascades in the 3D case with ǫ = 1/2.

To introduce eﬀect of rotation in the GOY model we propose that the Coriolis
force can be written in the form:

Fc = −iCru,

(7)

where the constant real coeﬃcient Cr is introduced for convenience. It is easy
∗
to see that the work of the Coriolis force (7) is zero (u∗
n = 0) and no
additional energy is introduced into the system (3) at any scale. This property
of the force (7) coincides with the property of the Coriolis force in 3D space
(1).

nFcn +unFc

Having in mind that in derivation of the shell model equations (3) all external
potential forces, as well as pressure, were already excluded using condition of
incompressibility (∇ · V = 0), Fc corresponds to the curl part of the Coriolis
force. We will return to this point when the case with the several forces will
be considered in section 5.

In the following sections we will consider the applications of the shell model (3,
7) to the free decay turbulence (section 4) and to the regime with the external
forcing (section 5). Special attention will be paid to the helicity generation
produced in such models (section 6).

4 Free decay hydrodynamic turbulence

To analize behaviour of the hydrodynamical turbulence without forcing we
start from the free decay regime (f = 0). After some intermediate regime for
the case without rotation (Fc = 0) the Kolmogorov’s spectrum (−5/3) recov-
ers, see ﬁgures 1, 2. The sharp breaks in the spectra at the large wave numbers
correspond to the Kolmogorov’s diﬀusion scale kd. The estimate based on the
n and diﬀusion Ek2

nun terms leads to kd ∼ Ro

As was predicted in [4], [5], introduction of rotation (Fc 6= 0) gives rise to a new
time scale τd ∼ Ω−1. For Ro ≪ 1, τd is already shorter then the characteristic
time in the Kolmogorov’s regime τdn ∼ k−2/3
. A simple dimensional analysis

where τ is the characteristic time and E(k) is the spectral energy density. In

If the eﬀect of rotation is suﬃcient, then substitution of τ ∼ Ω−1 into (8) leads
to the rotation spectrum law [5]:

RounΩ

Starting simulations from the initial ﬁeld obtained in the non-rotating regime,
after a short time period the original Kolmogorov’s spectrum splits into two
parts with two diﬀerent slopes, see Fig. 1, 2. The change in the slope (nΩ ∈
[10, 19] and kn = 2n) corresponds to kΩ = C2
, where CΩ = 1.22 ÷ 1.87 [5].
This estimate can be obtained from balancing the inertial term and the Coriolis
force. If for the large scales the Coriolis term is larger then the non-linear term,
the spectrum decays as ∼ k−2. In this case non-linear term do not depend on
k and the Coriolis term decays as ∼ k−1/2. The further behaviour depends
on how long the spectrum is and where the Kolmogorov’s wave number kd
lies. If kΩ > kd, then the whole spectrum decays as ∼ k−2. In the other
case (kΩ < kd) the Kolmogorov’s spectrum −5/3 for k > kΩ reappears. This
situation is demonstrated in the ﬁgures 1, 2. As the whole kinetic energy of
the system decays in time, the kΩ moves in to the region of the large wave
numbers. Note that the situation can be complicated by the high order eﬀects,
as the decay rates of the both spectra are diﬀerent.

5 Convection with external forcing

To consider the evolution of the system for time periods longer than the char-
acteristic decay time one needs to provide some source of energy to the system
or to introduce an external force f . Similar to the case with the Coriolis force,
f in (3) corresponds to the curl part of the force.

The results of simulations of the system (3) over the time period t = 103 with
a prescribed force f = 10−2(1 + i) at k0 = 1 without rotation are presented in
Fig. 3. Starting from an arbitrary initial velocity ﬁeld, the system (3) comes

5

to the statistically stable state with Kolmogorov’s energy distribution, similar
to the free decay case for the moment where the energy is comparable.

As was already mentioned above, the direct introduction of rotation setting
Cr = 1 in (7) is contradictive to the physics of the problem and to the original
equation (1). It is easy to see that for the regime of the fast rotation (Ro ≪
1) in the original Navier-Stokes equation (1), when V < Ro, the balance
between the pressure and the potential parts of the forces f and Fc holds.
Such a balance of the pressure and the Coriolis force, which takes place, e.g.,
in the Earth’s liquid core (E = 10−15, Ro = 4 · 10−7), is called the geostrophic
balance (in the present dimensionless units regime the Earth’s core situation
corresponds to RoV < 10−3). Exclusion of the pressure requires exclusion of
the potential parts of all the forces, too. Then, the remaining curl parts of
the forces are already of the same order as the inertial term and it is these
parts which are in the r. h. s. of (3). These considerations can be formulated
as follows:

Crn = Rokn|un|, Rokn|un|2 < |un|
Rokn|un|2 > |un|.
Crn = 1,

(

(11)

In other words, condition (11) means that for all wave numbers where the
Coriolis force is larger then the non-linear term it must be compensated by
the pressure, and its curl part (Fc) must be of the same order as the non-linear
term. (An example of violation of the condition (11) will be also considered
below.) The suggestion (11) is also supported by the recent paper [12], where
the scaling law ∼ k−2 for the geostrophycal balance was derived.

The results of simulations with rotation and Cr deﬁned by (11) are presented
in Fig. 3. As in the free decay case we observe two regimes with slopes ∼ k−2
for the small wave numbers and the Kolmogorov’s regime ∼ k−5/3 for the
wave numbers k > kΩ. It is easy to see that in this model the non-linear term
has a white spectrum for k < kΩ. Due to the condition (11), the curl part
of Coriolis term Fc has the same distribution in the wave space. This state
of equipartition was observed after averaging. Analysis of the phases of the
non-linear term and the Coriolis term reveals the existence of anticorrelation.
This is the reason why the spectrum of the rotating turbulence decreases faster
then Kolmogorov’s one. In fact, the Coriolis force partially locks the energy
transfer from large to small scales. Moreover, the Coriolis force blocks the
applied external force, so that Fc0 = −fc0 and suppresses injection of the
energy into the system (3, 7, 11).

To demonstrate this phenomenon we present calculations with Cr ten times
larger then was predicted by (11) (dotted line in Fig. 3). This regime shows
very strong blocking. Our calculations show that the further increase of the
Coriolis term leads to a degeneration of the spectrum at all. The solution then

6

has a singular spectrum and the whole energy is concentrated at the wave
number k0 where the force f is applied.

We also present results of calculations with a prescribed force of the form
f0 = 0.1(1 + i)/u∗
0 which allows us to deﬁne the exact amount of energy
injected into the system. It appears that the introduction of rotation leads
to an increase of the total energy of the system due to a decrease of the
energy dissipation in the cascade, see Fig. 4. Note that the similar eﬀect in
3D numerical simulations [7], where the external force was applied at some
intermediate scale, was caused by the inverse cascade.

6 Helicity generation

As follows from (5) in 3D case (ǫ = 1/2) the explicit form for helicity is

H =

(−1)nkn|un|2.

n
X

(12)

However, the direct application of formula (12) for the estimation of helicity or
the calculation of α-eﬀect can lead to misleading results. Additional assump-
tions on the physics of the process are required. To understand the nature of
the problem we will recall some basics of the mean-ﬁeld dynamo theory, where
the models of helicity for the rotating bodies were extensively studied.

According to [13], the mean helicity in the rotating body is deﬁned as H =<
V · (∇ × V) >, provided that the gradient of the density exists (< . . . >
means mean average). This problem reﬂects the statistical inequality of the
left-side and right-side rotating curls. In its turn, such inequality is caused
by existence of the selected direction (z), which is related to the global rota-
tion of the considered body. In absence of rotation the generated helicity has
stochastic temporal behavior and zero mean level. Moreover, in the case of the
Kolmogorov’s turbulence with E(k) ∼ k−5/3, the helicity H has an increasing
spectrum ∼ k1/3 and its amplitude will be deﬁned by the velocity ﬁeld near the
1 . The temporal behaviour of the he-
Kolmogorov’s cut-oﬀ wave number kd
licity for the case of the non-rotating homogeneous turbulence (with all other
parameters are equal to the case with forcing in section 5 and summation in
(12) is over the whole range of wave numbers) is presented in Fig. 5a. We
observe high frequency oscillations with the negligible mean level (H ∼ 102).

1 Note that for the dynamo applications the maximal wave number in the sum (12)
is limited by the condition rm ≥ 1, where rm is the micro-scale magnetic Reynolds
number.

7

This case can hardly describe the helicity observed in astrophysical and geo-
physical bodies with a stable sign over time periods much longer then the
characteristic convective times [14].

Application of the Coriolis force in the form (7) does not change the situation
essentially. In Fig. 5b we present calculations of H for the previously con-
sidered regime with rotation (Fig. 1). Even now, when the helicity spectrum
is white (∼ k0) and correspondingly contributions of the high harmonics are
smaller then in the Kolmogorov’s turbulence, the helicity behavior exhibits
strong oscillations with asymptotically zero mean level (H ∼ 101).

To estimate which part of helicity is produced in the rotational part of the
spectrum (k < kΩ) we limit the cut-oﬀ wave number in (12) to kM AX = kΩ,
see Fig. 5c. This ﬁltering decreases the dispersion of the helicity, but still does
not change its mean level (H ∼ 101).

To overcome the problem of zero mean level of helicity we have to introduce
an additional asymmetry in the system (3,7). So far in our homogeneous in-
compresible shell model the gradient of the density is absent, so we have to
include the missing eﬀect in the Coriolis force:

Fc = −iCru(1 + C1(−1)n),

(13)

where C1 is a real constant. The results of simulations with C1 = 4, kM AX = kΩ
are presented in Fig. 5d. In this case H ∼ 140 and is comparable with the
amplitude of the oscillations. The corresponding spectrum for this regime has
the same behavior as in the case when the Coriolis force was deﬁned by (7),
see Fig. 3.

7 Conclusions

The proposed shell model approach description to the rotating hydrodynami-
cal turbulence demonstrates the principal possibility to reproduce the scaling
law ∼ k−2 predicted in [4], [5]. This deviation from the homogeneous Kol-
mogorov’s turbulence represents the reduction of the 3D space problem toward
2D space, where the direct cascade of enstrophy already has ∼ k−3 slope. In
terms of the shell models one can solve the Cauchy problem for evaluating
rotating turbulence and mimic its dynamical behavior in time. As was men-
tioned, the problem of rotating turbulence has applications to the liquid core
of th Earth. The estimate of the Reynolds number based on the west drift
velocity and molecular viscosity gives Re ∼ 109, which is out of reach of any
modern supercomputers in 3D direct numerical simulations. The situation in
many other astrophysical bodies is even more dramatic where the estimates

8

of the Reynolds number give Re ≫ 1010 [14]. This Reynolds number is no
problem in the shell model, where the wide range of scales can be covered by
a few harmonics. That is why the proposed application of the shell model to
the fast rotation regime is a very promising step in its development. We also
realize that the mechanism of helicity generation proposed by [13] is not the
only one and some forms of helicity generation diﬀerent from (13) are pos-
sible. The present approach was dictated by its popularity in the mean-ﬁeld
dynamo model of the α-eﬀect. We plan to use the shell model developed for the
computation of the subgrid processes in the 3D large-scale thermal convection
problem similar to [15].

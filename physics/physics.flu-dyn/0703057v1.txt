Vortical structures of turbulence, i.e., vortex tubes and sheets, are studied using one-dimensional
velocity data obtained in laboratory experiments for duct ﬂows and boundary layers at microscale
Reynolds numbers from 332 to 1934. We study the mean velocity proﬁle of intense vortical struc-
tures. The contribution from vortex tubes is dominant. The radius scales with the Kolmogorov
length. The circulation velocity scales with the rms velocity ﬂuctuation. We also study the spatial
distribution of intense vortical structures. The distribution is self-similar over small scales and is
random over large scales. Since these features are independent of the microscale Reynolds number
and of the conﬁguration for turbulence production, they appear to be universal.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Turbulence contains various classes of structures that
are embedded in the background random ﬂuctuation.
They are important to intermittency as well as mixing
and diﬀusion. Of particular interest are small-scale struc-
tures, which could have universal features that are inde-
pendent of the Reynolds number and of the large-scale
ﬂow. We explore such universality using velocity data
obtained in laboratory experiments.

We focus on vortical structures, i.e., vortex tubes and
sheets. The former is often regarded as the elementary
structure of turbulence.1,2,3 At low microscale Reynolds
numbers, Reλ <
∼ 200, direct numerical simulations de-
rived basic parameters of vortex tubes.3,4,5,6,7,8 The radii
are of the order of the Kolmogorov length η. The total
lengths are of the order of the correlation length L. The
circulation velocities are of the order of the rms velocity
ﬂuctuation hu2i1/2 or the Kolmogorov velocity uK. Here
h·i denotes an average. The lifetimes are of the order of
the turnover time for energy-containing eddies L/hu2i1/2.
For these vortical structures, however, universality
has not been established because the behavior at high
Reynolds numbers has not been known. At Reλ >
∼ 200,
a direct numerical simulation is not easy for now.

The promising approach is velocimetry in laboratory
experiments. A probe suspended in the ﬂow is used
to obtain a one-dimensional cut of the velocity ﬁeld.
The velocity variation is intense at the positions of in-
tense structures. Especially at the positions of intense
vortical structures, the variation of the velocity compo-
nent that is perpendicular to the one-dimensional cut is
intense.9,10 Thus, the velocity variation oﬀers some infor-
mation about intense structures, although it is diﬃcult
to specify their geometry.

However,

We accordingly use duct ﬂows and boundary layers
to compare features of intense vortical structures along
the Reynolds number. The highest Reynolds number
is Reλ = 1934, which exceeds those of the prior stud-
ies. Our experiments are described in Sec. II. We dis-
cuss in Sec. III what information is available from one-
dimensional velocity data. The scale, intensity, and spa-
tial distribution of vortical structures are studied in Secs.
IV–VI. The conclusions are summarized in Sec. VII.

II. EXPERIMENT

A. Duct ﬂow

The experiment was done in a wind tunnel of the Mete-
orological Research Institute. Table I lists experimental
conditions and turbulence parameters. The microscale
Reynolds number ranges from Reλ = 719 to 1934.

We use coordinates x, y, and z in the streamwise,
spanwise, and ﬂoor-normal directions. The correspond-
ing ﬂow velocities are U + u, v, and w. Here U is the
mean while u, v, and w are the ﬂuctuations. The origin
x = y = z = 0 m is on the tunnel ﬂoor at the entrance
to the test section. Its size was δx = 18 m, δy = 3 m,
and δz = 2 m. We placed a rectangular duct with width
δy = 1.3 m and δz = 1.4 m at x = −2 m. The duct center
was on the tunnel axis.

For the ﬂow velocities U∗ from 11 to 55 m s−1 at the
duct exit, we measured the streamwise and spanwise ve-
locities at x = 15.5 m and z = 0.6 m. The ﬂow was
turbulent there. During each of the measurements, the
ﬂow temperature was constant within ±1◦C.

We used a hot-wire anemometer, which was composed
of a constant-temperature system and a crossed-wire
probe. The wires were made of tungsten, 5 µm in di-
ameter, 1.25 mm in sensing length, 1.4 mm in separation,

The signal was linearized, low-pass ﬁltered at 24 dB per
octave, and then digitally sampled at 16-bit resolution.
We set the sampling frequency fs as high as possible, on
condition that high-frequency noise was not signiﬁcant
in the power spectrum. The ﬁlter cutoﬀ frequency was
one-half of the sampling frequency. For fs ≤ 50 kHz,
we obtained 108 data of the streamwise and spanwise
velocities. For fs > 50 kHz, we obtained 4 × 108 data
of the spanwise velocity alone. This is due to a fs limit
of our sampling device. Supplementarily, we obtained
4 × 107 data of the streamwise and spanwise velocities at
fs = 50 kHz.

The temporal variations were converted into the spa-
tial variations using Taylor’s frozen-eddy hypothesis,
which requires that the turbulence strength hu2i1/2/U is
small enough. This requirement is satisﬁed in our experi-
ments where hu2i1/2/U <
∼ 0.2. Even for hu2i1/2/U ≃ 0.3,
the validity of Taylor’s hypothesis was conﬁrmed using
data obtained simultaneously with two probes separated
by streamwise distances.16

By assuming local isotropy h(∂xv)2i = 2h(∂xu)2i, the
small-scale statistics were obtained from the spanwise-
velocity derivative ∂xv, instead of the usual streamwise-
velocity derivative ∂xu. At small scales, the u component
measured by a crossed-wire probe is contaminated with
the w component that is perpendicular to the two wires
of the probe.17 The v component is free from such con-
tamination.

The experiment was done in the same wind tunnel
with the same instruments as for the duct ﬂows. Table I
lists experimental conditions and turbulence parameters.
They are close to those in our prior study,15 except that
the sampling frequency is higher and the data are longer.
The microscale Reynolds number ranges from Reλ = 332
to 1304.

Over the entire ﬂoor of the test section of the wind
tunnel, we placed blocks as roughness for the boundary
layer. The block size was δx = 0.06 m, δy = 0.21 m,
and δz = 0.11 m. The spacing of adjacent blocks was
δx = δy = 0.5 m.

For the incoming-ﬂow velocities U∗ from 2 to 20 m s−1,
we measured the streamwise and spanwise velocities at
x = 12.5 m. The boundary layer was well developed
there. While the 99% thickness was 0.8 m, the displace-
ment thickness was 0.2 m.15 The measurement height was
z = 0.25–0.35 m in the log-law sublayer.

III. BURGERS VORTEX

By using the Burgers vortex, an idealized model for
vortex tubes, we discuss what information is available
from a one-dimensional cut of the velocity ﬁeld. The
Burgers vortex is an axisymmetric steady circulation in
a strain ﬁeld. In cylindrical coordinates, the circulation

Here ν is the kinematic viscosity and a0 (> 0) is a
constant. The circulation is maximal at R = R0 =
2.24(ν/a0)1/2. We regard R0 as the vortex radius.

There are other models for vortex tubes, e.g., the
Lundgren spirals.18 We use the Burgers vortex alone be-
cause detailed information about individual structures is
anyway not available from one-dimensional velocity data.

Suppose that the axis of the Burgers vortex penetrates
the (x, y) plane at a point (x0, y0) as shown in Fig. 1.
The x and y axes are in the streamwise and spanwise
directions.
If the inclination of the Burgers vortex is
(θ0, ϕ0) in spherical coordinates, the streamwise (u) and
spanwise (v) components of the circulation ﬂow uΘ along
the x axis are

When the Burgers vortex is close to the x axis and is not
heavily inclined, i.e., |y0| <
∼ R0 and θ0 ≃ 0, the spanwise
velocity is dominated by the small-scale circulation ﬂow
[Eq. (2b)]. The streamwise velocity is dominated by the
large-scale radial inﬂow [Eq. (4a)]. When |y0| ≫ R0 or
θ0 ≫ 0, the signal is weak at least for the small-scale

variation in the spanwise velocity.

Then, suppose that velocity data are obtained on a
one-dimensional cut of a ﬂow that consists of vortex tubes
and the background random ﬂuctuation. The tube posi-
tion (x0, y0) and inclination (θ0, ϕ0) are supposed to be
random. This is likely in our experiments, where tur-

bulence was almost isotropic because the measured ra-
tio hu2i/hv2i is not far from unity (Table I). The vortex
tubes induce small-scale variations in the spanwise veloc-
ity. If we consider intense velocity variations above a high
threshold, their scale and amplitude are close to the ra-
dius and circulation velocity of intense vortex tubes with
|y0| <
∼ R0 and θ0 ≃ 0. To demonstrate this, mean proﬁles
are calculated for the circulation ﬂows uΘ of the Burgers
vortices with random positions (x0, y0) and inclinations
(θ0, ϕ0). Their radii R0 and maximum circulation veloc-
ities V0 = uΘ(R0) are set to be the same. We consider
the Burgers vortices with |∂xv| at x = 0 being above a
threshold, |∂xv|/3 at x = 0 for x0 = y0 = θ0 = 0. When
∂xv is negative, the sign of the v signal is inverted before
the averaging. The result is shown in Fig. 2. Despite the
relatively low threshold, the scale and peak amplitude of
the mean v proﬁle are still close to those of the v proﬁle
for x0 = y0 = θ0 = 0 (dotted line). The extended tails
are due to the Burgers vortices with |y0| ≫ R0 or θ0 ≫ 0.

IV. MEAN VELOCITY PROFILE

Mean proﬁles of

intense vortical structures in the
streamwise (u) and spanwise (v) velocities are extracted,

by averaging signals centered at the position where the
absolute spanwise-velocity increment |v(x + r/2) − v(x −
r/2)| is above a threshold.10,13,14,15,19 The scale r is the
sampling interval U/fs. The threshold is such that 0.1%
or 1% of the increments are used for the averaging (here-
after, the 0.1% or 1% threshold). These increments com-
prise the tail of the probability density distribution of all
the increments as in Fig. 3.20 Example of the results are
shown in Fig. 4.20

The v proﬁle in Fig. 4 is close to the v proﬁle in
Fig. 2. Hence, the contribution from vortex tubes is
dominant. The contribution from vortex sheets is not
dominant. If it were dominant, the v proﬁle should ex-
hibit some kind of step.12 Direct numerical simulations
at Reλ <
∼ 200 revealed that intense vorticity tends to be
organized into tubes rather than sheets.4,5,6,7,21,22 This
tendency appears to exist up to Reλ ≃ 2000. Vortex
sheets might contribute to the extended tails in Fig. 4.
They are more pronounced than those in Fig. 2. Here
it should be noted that our discussion is somewhat sim-
pliﬁed because there is no strict division between vortex
tubes and sheets in real turbulence.

By ﬁtting the v proﬁle in Fig. 4 around its peaks by
the v proﬁle of the Burgers vortex for x0 = y0 = θ0 = 0
(dotted line), we estimate the radius R0 and maximum

For all the data, the R0 and V0 values are summarized
in Table II. They characterize the scale and intensity
of vortical structures, even if they are not the Burgers
vortices. The radius R0 is several times the Kolmogorov
length η. The maximum circulation velocity V0 is several
tenths of the rms velocity ﬂuctuation hv2i1/2 and several
times the Kolmogorov velocity uK. Similar results were
obtained from direct numerical simulations3,4,6,7,8 and
laboratory experiments11,12,14,15 at the lower Reynolds
numbers, Reλ <

The u proﬁle in Fig. 4 is separated for ∂xu > 0 (u+)
and ∂xu ≤ 0 (u−) at x = 0. Since the contamina-
tion with the w component17 induces a symmetric posi-
tive excursion,14,23,24 we decomposed the u± proﬁles into
symmetric and antisymmetric components and show only
the antisymmetric components.15 The u± proﬁles in Fig.
4 have larger amplitudes than those in Fig. 2. Hence,
the u± proﬁles in Fig. 4 are dominated by the circu-
lation ﬂows uΘ of vortex tubes that passed the probe
with some incidence angles to the mean ﬂow direction,11
tan−1[v/(U +u)].@The radial inﬂow uR of the strain ﬁeld
is not discernible, except that the u− proﬁle has a larger
amplitude than the u+ proﬁle.14,15 Unlike the Burgers
vortex, a real vortex tube is not always oriented to the
stretching direction.4,5,6,7,8,25

are dominated by vortex tubes, we expect that the distri-
bution of intense vortical structures studied here is also
essentially the distribution of intense vortex tubes. Ex-
amples of the probability density distribution P (δx0) are
shown in Figs. 5 and 6.20

The probability density distribution has an exponen-
tial tail14,15 that appears linear on the semi-log plot of
Fig. 5. This exponential law is characteristic of intervals
for a Poisson process of random and independent events.

V. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION

The spatial distribution of intense vortical structures
is studied using the distribution of interval δx0 between
successive intense velocity increments.13,14,15,22 The in-
tense velocity increment is deﬁned in the same manner
as for the mean velocity proﬁles in Sec. IV. Since they

value, and it is vertically shifted by a factor 10. The dotted
line indicates the power-law slope from 30η to 300η. The
interval is normalized by the Kolmogorov length η. The arrow
indicates the spanwise correlation length Lv.

The large-scale distribution of intense vortical structures
is random and independent.

Below the spanwise correlation length Lv, the proba-
bility density is enhanced over that for the exponential
distribution.15 Thus, intense vortical structures cluster
together below the energy-containing scale. In fact, di-
rect numerical simulations revealed that intense vortex
tubes lie on borders of energy-containing eddies.6

Over small intervals, the probability density distribu-
tion is a power law13,22 that appears linear on the log-log
plot of Fig. 6:

Thus, the small-scale clustering of intense vortical struc-
tures is self-similar and has no characteristic scale.22 Ta-

The exponential law over large intervals and the power
law over small intervals were also found in laboratory ex-
periments for regions of low pressure.26,27,28,29 They are
associated with vortex tubes, although their radii tend to
be larger than those of intense vortical structures studied
here.29

VI. SCALING LAW

6

Dependence of parameters for intense vortical struc-
tures on the microscale Reynolds number Reλ and on the
conﬁguration for turbulence production, i.e., duct ﬂow or
boundary layer, is studied in Fig. 7. Each quantity was
normalized by its value in the duct ﬂow at Reλ = 1934
individually for the 0.1% and 1% thresholds. That is, we
avoid the prefactors that depend on the threshold. When
the threshold is high, the radius R0 is small, the maxi-
mum circulation velocity V0 is large, and the clustering
exponent µ0 is small as in Table II. We focus on scaling
laws of these quantities.

The radius R0 scales with the Kolmogorov length η
as R0 ∝ η [Fig. 7(a)]. Thus, intense vortical structures
remain to be of smallest scales of turbulence.

The maximum circulation velocity V0 scales with the
rms velocity ﬂuctuation hv2i1/2 as V0 ∝ hv2i1/2 [Fig.
7(b)]. Although the rms velocity ﬂuctuation is a charac-

be formed via shear instability on borders of energy-
containing eddies,6,27,28 where a small-scale velocity vari-
ation could be comparable to the rms velocity ﬂuctua-
tion. The maximum circulation velocity does not scale
with the Kolmogorov velocity uK, a characteristic of the
small-scale ﬂow, as V0 ∝ uK [Fig. 7(c)].

The scalings of the radius R0 and circulation veloc-

if R0 ∝ η and V0 ∝ uK.

(7b)

Our result favors the former scaling [Fig. 7(e)] rather
than the latter [Fig. 7(d)]. With an increase of Reλ,
intense vortical structures progressively have higher Re0
and are more unstable.6,7 Their lifetimes are shorter. It
is known30 that the ﬂatness factor h(∂xv)4i/h(∂xv)2i2
scales with Re0.3
λ . Since h(∂xv)4i is dominated by in-
tense vortical structures, it scales with hv2i2/η4. Since
h(∂xv)2i2 is dominated by the background random ﬂuc-
K/η4. If the number density of
tuation, it scales with u4
intense vortical structures remains the same, we have
h(∂xv)4i/h(∂xv)2i2 ∝ hv2i2/u4
λ. The diﬀerence
from the real scaling implies that vortical structures with
V0 ≃ hv2i1/2 are less numerous at a higher Reynolds num-
ber Reλ, albeit energetically more important.

K ∝ Re2

The small-scale clustering exponent µ0 is constant [Fig.
7(f)]. A similar result with µ0 ≃ 1 was obtained from
laboratory experiments of the K´arm´an ﬂow between two
rotating disks22 at Reλ ≃ 400–1600. The small-scale
clustering of intense vortical structures at high Reynolds
numbers Reλ is independent of the conﬁguration for tur-
bulence production.

Lastly, recall that only intense vortical structures are
considered here. For all vortical structures with vari-
ous intensities, the scalings V0 ∝ hv2i1/2 and Re0 =
R0V0/ν ∝ Re1/2
are not necessarily expected. For all
vortex tubes, in fact, direct numerical simulations3,8 at
Reλ <
∼ 200 derived the scaling V0 ∝ uK. The devel-
opment of an experimental method to study all vortical
structures is desirable.

VII. CONCLUSION

7

The spanwise velocity was measured in duct ﬂows at
Reλ = 719–1934 and in boundary layers at Reλ = 332–
1304 (Table I). We used these velocity data to study fea-
tures of vortical structures, i.e., vortex tubes and sheets.
We studied the mean velocity proﬁles of intense vor-
tical structures (Fig. 4). The contribution from vortex
tubes is dominant. Essentially, our results are those for
vortex tubes. The radius R0 is several times the Kol-
mogorov length η. The maximum circulation velocity V0
is several tenths of the rms velocity ﬂuctuation hv2i1/2
and several times the Kolmogorov velocity uK (Table
II). There are the scalings R0 ∝ η, V0 ∝ hv2i1/2, and
Re0 = R0V0/ν ∝ Re1/2
(Fig. 7).

λ

We also studied the distribution of interval between in-
tense vortical structures. Over large intervals, the distri-
bution obeys an exponential law (Fig. 5), which reﬂects a
random and independent distribution of intense vortical
structures. Over small intervals, the distribution obeys a
power law (Fig. 6), which reﬂects self-similar clustering
of intense vortical structures. The clustering exponent is
constant, µ0 ≃ 1 (Table II and Fig. 7).

Direct numerical simulations3,4,6,7,8,9,10 and laboratory
experiments11,12,13,14,15,22 derived some of those features.
We have found that they are independent of the Reynolds
number and of the conﬁguration for turbulence produc-
tion, up to Reλ ≃ 2000 that exceeds the Reynolds num-
bers of the prior studies.

The Reynolds numbers Reλ in our study are still lower
than those of some turbulence, e.g., atmospheric turbu-
lence at Reλ >
∼ 104. Such turbulence is expected to
contain intense vortical structures, because turbulence
is more intermittent at a higher Reynolds number Reλ
and small-scale intermittency is attributable to intense
vortical structures. They are expected to have the same
features as found in our study. These features appear to
have reached asymptotes at Reλ ≃ 2000 (Fig. 7), regard-
less of the conﬁguration for turbulence production, and
hence appear to be universal at high Reynolds numbers
Reλ.

tuation of the instantaneous velocity U +u at which a struc-
ture passes the probe. Under Taylor’s frozen-eddy hypoth-
esis, the velocity increment over the sampling interval U/fs
is more intense for a faster-moving structure, which is more
likely to be incorporated in our conditional averaging.14

free from the w component.

the threshold, each increment is taken to determine the
center of a vortex. This is somewhat unreasonable but
does not cause serious problems, judging from Fig. 2 where
mean velocity proﬁles were obtained practically in the
same manner.

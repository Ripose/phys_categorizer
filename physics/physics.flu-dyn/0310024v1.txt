In this paper, the phenomenon of band gaps and Anderson localization of water waves over one-
dimensional periodic and random bottoms is investigated by the transfer matrix method. The results
indicate that the range of localization in random bottoms can be coincident with the band gaps for
the corresponding periodic bottoms. Inside the gap or localization regime, a collective behavior of
water waves appears. The results are also compared with acoustic and optical situations.

PACS numbers: 47.10.+g, 47.11.+j, 47.35.+i; Keywords: water waves propagation, random media

When propagating through structured media, waves
will be multiply reﬂected or scattered, leading to many
interesting phenomena such as band gaps in periodic
structures [1] and localization in disordered media[2].
Within a band gap, waves are evanescent; when local-
ized, they remain conﬁned in space until dissipated. The
phenomenon of band gaps and localization has been both
extensively and intensively studied for electronic, electro-
magnetic, and acoustic systems. A great body of litera-
ture is available, as summarized in Ref. [3].

The propagation of waters through underwater struc-
tures has also been widely studied, because of its impor-
tance in a number of coastal engineering problems. In
particular, the consideration of band gaps has been re-
cently applied to water wave systems [4, 5, 6, 7]. Some of
the advances have been reviewed, for example, by McIver
[8]. On one hand, the most recent experiment has used
water waves to demonstrate the phenomenon of Bloch
waves as a result of the modulation by periodic bottom
structures [6]. On the other hand, the possible band gaps
have been recently proposed for water waves propagation
through arrays of rigid cylinders that regularly stand in
the water [7].

Relatively speaking, the more intriguing concept of
Anderson localization remains less touched in the con-
text of water waves. Although the earlier attempts do
show that the localization phenomenon is possible for
water waves [9], a few important issues have not been dis-
cussed. These issues include, for example, the statistical
properties of localization, the phase behavior of the local-
ized states, single parameter scaling and universality, and
the relation between localization and band gaps of cor-
responding periodic situations. Recent research [10, 11]
indicates that these issues are essential in discerning lo-
calization eﬀects. As such, it might be desirable to con-
sider the localization of water waves further.

In the present Letter, we wish to study the localization
of water waves in one-dimensional randomly structured
bottoms, and its relation with band gaps of the corre-
sponding periodic bottoms. The phase behavior of the
water waves in the presence of localization will also be
discussed.

The system we consider is illustrated in Fig. 1. Here

is shown that there are N identical steps of width d pe-
riodically placed on the bottom. The periodicity is L.
The depth of water is h, and the depth of the steps is h1.
We suppose that the surface waves propagate from left to
the right. The disorders are introduced as follows. The
degree of disorder is measured as the percent of random
displacement of the steps within a range around their
original regular positions with regard to the periodic con-
stant. Obviously the maximum (complete) randomness
is 1 − d/L; half random (order) is thus 1/2 − d/(2L).

The wavenumbers in the water (k) and over the steps

(k1) are determined as [12]

where ω0 = gL. In the simulation, all lengths are scaled
by L, and the frequency is scaled by ω0.

Clearly, AL is the incident wave, AR the outgoing wave,
and BL the reﬂected wave. BR is zero since there is
no wave coming from the right. For a unit plane wave
incidence, AL = 1.

By the standard transfer matrix method [11], the coef-
ﬁcients AR, AL, BL can be related by a transfer matrix.

The transmission coeﬃcient is deﬁned as T =

form, η(x) = eiKxu(x), where u(x) is a periodic function
with the periodicity of the structure. Then the dispersion

simulation, we found that the step depth h1 is vital in
determining the band structures, and subsequently the
localization.

FIG. 2: The dispersions and band structures versus frequency.
Dispersions: (a1) Variation of the step depth with h = 1, d =
0.4; (a2) Variation of the step width h = 1, h1 = 0.05; (a3)
Variation of the water depth with h1 = 0.05, d = 0.04. The
variation of the band structures against d and h: ((b1) h =
1, h1 = 0.5, d = 0.4; (b2) h = 1, h1 = 0.05, d = 0.6; (b3)
h = 0.5, h1 = 0.05, d = 0.4.

Fig. 2 shows the dispersion and band structures for pe-
riodic systems. Figs. 2(a1), (a2) and (a3) present the de-
pendence of the dispersion on the variations of the depth
and the width of the steps, and the water depth. The
curves within or outside the dark areas refer to the pass-
ing or forbidden bands respectively. We observe the fol-
lowing from Fig. 2. (1) There are band gaps for water
systems. But with increasing h1, the band gaps become
narrower, referring to (a1). (2) The band gaps move to-
wards lower frequencies by increasing the width of the
steps, as shown by (a2). (3) While the band structures
are sensitive to the physical structures of the steps, they
are rather insensitive to the variation of the water depth,
as evidenced by (a3). (4) The band gaps start to disap-
pear as the frequency increases. This is understandable.
For high frequencies, especially when kh, kh1 >> 1, the
dispersion relation becomes ω2 = gk, therefore the struc-
ture of the bottom has less and less eﬀects. Some band

In Fig. 3, we show the transmission versus frequency
for diﬀerent randomness. As a comparison, the transmis-
sion for the ordered case is also shown. The results indi-
cate the following. (1) There are well deﬁned inhibited
transmission ranges for the ordered case, coincident with
the band gaps shown in Fig. 2. And these ranges decrease
with frequency, until disappear. The degree of inhibition
more or less decreases with frequency. These features
diﬀer from those in optical and acoustic systems [11, 13].
(2) The disorder tends to reduce the transmission for the
mid range of frequency, but it has less inﬂuences for low
or high frequencies, implying that the scattering by the
steps is weak in these ranges. The inhibition in the pres-
ence of disorders is an indication and measure of localiza-
tion. (3) Within the band gaps, the disorder tends to en-
hance the wave propagation, a feature that has been also
discovered previously in the optical and acoustic systems
[11, 13]. But diﬀerent from these systems, the inhibition
starts to decease as frequency increases. We also notice
that in some cases the strong localization is coincident

with the band gaps, particularly for the ﬁrst two band
gaps. (4) The level of localization does not necessarily
depend on the degree of disorders. For example, within
the ﬁrst band gap, the wave is more localized for the half
random than the completely random case.

FIG. 5: Energy distribution and the phase behavior (insets)
for the ordered and totally random cases. The structure pa-
rameters are the same as in Fig. 4.

We have also studied the statistical properties of lo-
calization by considering the Lyapounov exponent (LE)
γ = limN→∞h− 1
N ln(T )i, where N is the number of
steps, and its variance as a function of frequency. LE
characterizes the degree of localization, and its variance
signiﬁes the transition behavior. The results are shown in
Fig. 4. The parameters are indicated in the caption. Here
we see that behavior of LE mimics the hand structures,
particularly for weak disorders. Similar to the optical
case [10], but contrary to the acoustic case [11], there are
two double maxima for the variance inside the gaps. This
feature is more prominent in the low frequency bands.
Diﬀerent from both optical and acoustic cases, the dou-

3

ble peak feature in the variance does not disappear even
in the complete random case, depicted by (a2). We also
plot LE versus its variance in Fig. 4. Here even in the
totally random situation, we do not observe the linear
dependence between LE and its variance in contrast to
the expectation from the scaling analysis of localization
[14].

The energy distribution and the phase behavior of wa-
ter waves in the ordered and disordered cases are shown
in Fig. 5. The energy is deﬁned as the modulus of the
waves, and the phase θ is deﬁned from η = |η|eiθ. To
show the phase behavior, we associate a phase vector
to the phase as ~v = (cos θ, sin θ) and the phase vector is
plotted in two-dimensions. Two frequencies are chosen to
be inside and outside the second gap, referring to Fig. 3.
Comparing the ordered and disordered cases, we observe
clearly that the energy or the wave is indeed conﬁned by
the disorder to the site of transmission. But the decay of
the energy along the path does not follow the exponen-
tial feature. Here we see, within the gaps in the ordered
case or when the localization occurs, the phase vectors at
diﬀerent space points tends to point to the same or the
opposite directions. Such a collective behavior of water
waves has not been discussed before. At the end of the
step arrays, there is some disorientation in the pointing
directions of the phase vectors. This is due to the ﬁnite
size eﬀect.

In summary, we have applied the concept of band
gaps and localization to water surface waves in a one-
dimensional system. The statistical properties of local-
ization and their relation with corresponding band gaps
are studied. It is shown that localization is related to a
coherent behavior of the system.

Previous observations of the nontransient oscillations of rising bubbles and falling spheres in
wormlike micellar ﬂuids were limited to a single surfactant system. We present an extensive survey
of rising bubbles in another system, an aqueous solution of cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium
salicylate, with and without NaCl, across a range of concentrations and temperatures. Two diﬀer-
ent types of oscillation are seen in diﬀerent concentration ranges, each with its own temperature
dependence. Rheological data allows for the identiﬁcation of these diﬀerent hydrodynamic states
with diﬀerent ﬂuid microstructures.

Fluids are often broadly categorized as either Newto-
nian or non-Newtonian, according to whether the Navier-
Stokes equation does or does not accurately describe the
ﬂuid’s motion. Newtonian ﬂuids consist of molecules
small enough to be approximated by point masses (such
as air and water), while non-Newtonian consist of larger
structures (such as polymers). This increased size aﬀords
greater degrees of freedom which leads to macroscopic
viscoelasticity [1]. Fluids consisting of self-assembling
cylindrical (or wormlike) micelles resemble polymeric ﬂu-
ids on the microscopic scale, with the added feature that
their length distribution is determined by aggregation ki-
netics; micelles continually break and reform [2, 3, 4].
The molecular level physics is clearly more complicated
for such ﬂuids, and one can reasonably expect this will
introduce a new set of ﬂow properties to the class of non-
Newtonian ﬂuids.

Several novel results have been reported in both vis-
cometric ﬂows [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and hydrodynamic (non-
viscometric) ﬂows [10, 11, 12] of various wormlike micel-
lar ﬂuids. Among these, a falling pendant drop at the
bottom of a thin ﬁlament has been observed to slow to
a complete stop before the ﬁlament suddenly ruptures
[10]; this rupture has been conﬁrmed in other conﬁgu-
rations [13]. Also, rising air bubbles and falling solid
spheres have been observed to oscillate without reaching
a terminal velocity [11, 12]. While in polymer solutions
a rising bubble displays a sharp non-axisymmetric cusp,
which remains unchanged during a steady rise [1, 14], in
wormlike micellar ﬂuids the cusp periodically extends to
a sharp point, then retracts to a blunt edge (see Fig.1). It
is likely that these new dynamics are a manifestation of
the reversible scission reactions of the micelles, though
the precise mechanism may be quite complicated. An-
other type of ﬂuid is known to include scission-like reac-
tions at its microscale - associating polymer solutions -
and falling sphere oscillations are reported in that system
as well [15, 16].

In this Letter we report a detailed survey of the os-
cillatory motion of rising bubbles in a wormlike micellar
ﬂuid. To study the role of the aggregation kinetics of

the micelles, both concentration and ﬂuid temperature
were varied over a wide range, unlike previous studies
[11, 12]. As these parameters change, diﬀerent micellar
architectures are possible - from short linear or branched
micelles to crosslinked networks [17, 18, 19]. Four dif-
ferent dynamics were seen: Newtonian behavior at high
temperatures, standard polymeric behavior, and two dis-
tinct oscillating responses occurring in diﬀerent concen-
tration ranges (Fig.2). We performed steady rheology
experiments to identify the ﬂuid microstate, and found
that transitions in the equilibrium structure match tran-
sitions in bubble dynamics. Critical temperature bounds
were also found, which can be interpreted as a minimum
length of micelle required for oscillations to occur, so that
for certain concentrations the ﬂuid may be tuned with
temperature to make bubbles either oscillate, rise with a
stable cusp, or rise as bubbles in a Newtonian ﬂuid.

Non-transient oscillating bubbles were ﬁrst observed in
aqueous solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) [11]; here we use
another familiar system, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPCl)
and NaSal, with the ﬁxed ratio [NaSal]/[CPCl] = 1 (ex-
cept for the NaCl experiments described below). Our

Concentration  (mM)

choice for this ratio gives a solution of ﬂexible cylindrical
micelles analogous to polymer chains [5]. All experimen-
tal results are for a single rising bubble, with volumes
ranging from 14 mm3 to 110 mm3. The bubble is injected
into the ﬂuid at the bottom of a temperature controlled
plastic cylinder (31 cm height, 5 cm diameter) using a
syringe with a long stainless steel tube (inner diameter
of either 1.0 mm or 1.5 mm). The ratio of the horizon-
tal diameter of the bubble d to the cylinder diameter D
is d/D ≤ 0.14, and we have also checked that bubbles
oscillate for d/D ≃ 0.02. Typical sizes of the Reynolds
number (inertia) are Re ≃ 10−2 − 5, while the Debo-
rah number (elasticity) ranged from De ≃ 1 − 500, sim-
ilar to values seen for oscillating bubbles and spheres in
CTAB/NaSal [11, 12]. Rheological data were taken with
a Rheometrics RFS-III controlled rate of strain rheome-
ter with circulating ﬂuid temperature bath, using a stain-
less steel Couette geometry. Video images were made
with a Kodak high speed CCD camera.

We have studied concentrations from 4 to 40 mM
(weight fractions 0.13% ≤ ϕ ≤ 1.3%). From 5 to 15
mM, bubbles have a cusp which oscillates in length and
changes shape (Fig.1). While rising, the cusp length-
ens (frames 1-4 in Fig.1) during which the velocity as
measured at the top of the bubble is nearly constant.
At the apex of the extension, the tail abruptly retracts
and the bubble jumps upward (frames 4-5). After this
it slows to a nearly constant velocity until the cycle re-
peats. Typically, bubbles begin to oscillate within 10
seconds of their formation, with a similar time between
jumps. These clearly visible oscillations, which we call
type I, are apparently not a transient eﬀect; we have ob-
served their persistence for rise distances over one meter,
during which there were more than 30 oscillations in ∼
35 s (for 8 mM CPCl/NaSal), and velocities more than
doubled during a jump. This is the typical type I behav-
ior in the temperature ranges shown in Fig.2, consistent

with the oscillations observed in CTAB/NaSal [11].

Above a critical temperature in the type I range
(Fig.2), bubbles have a sharp cusp which does not change
in length (“steady cusp” in Fig.2) and velocities smoothly
reach a steady state; the oscillatory instability vanishes.
By 60◦C, the solutions appear Newtonian (“no cusp”
in Fig.2):
large enough bubbles are ellipsoidal and un-
dergo the well-known side-to-side oscillations [20]. In this
temperature range, the micelles must be predominantly
spherical or short rigid rods [21].

Upon increasing the concentration from 15 mM to 16
mM (ϕ = 0.5% to 0.53%), all oscillations cease. Bubbles
rise steadily with a stable cusp for concentrations up to
20 mM; there are no temperatures at which oscillations
occur (Fig.2). It is striking that a rising bubble would be
so aﬀected by so slight a concentration change. Note the
transition temperature from polymeric to Newtonian be-
havior reaches a maximum at this concentration (Fig.2).
More surprising is the re-emergence of oscillations for
concentrations from 25 mM to 40 mM (0.8% ≤ ϕ ≤
1.3%). Yet here the oscillations, which we call type II,
are visibly diﬀerent from type I oscillations; the shape
change involves the entire bubble, whereas in type I it
seems restricted to the tail. A type II oscillation begins
with a constriction in width near the top, while the whole
bubble lengthens. This constriction then travels down-
ward, as if the bubble were squeezing through a hoop.
Deﬁning wmax to be the maximum (relaxed) width (at

h
h
its waist), wmin to be its most constricted width, and
∆w = wmax − wmin, we found ∆w/wmax = 0.13 in
type II ﬂuids and 0.04 in type I. Length extensions, how-
ever, were ∆l/lmin = 0.25 in type II and 0.27 in type I;
for bubbles rising in CTAB/NaSal, ∆l/lmin = 0.26 [11].
This previous study revealed only one type of oscillation,
which from the shape dynamics we identify as type I [11].
Although wormlike micelles are comprised of surfac-
tants, it is unlikely that surface tension plays a role in the
bubble oscillations, since falling rigid spheres also oscil-
late [12]. Furthermore, our observation of two oscillation
types suggests that the viscoelastic character of the bulk
ﬂuid is changing with concentration. We address this
with rheology measurements, controlling the shear strain
rate ˙γ and recording the eﬀective viscosity, ηeﬀ = σxy/ ˙γ,
where σxy is the steady shear stress. Transient tests were
also performed to ensure that steady state was achieved.
Shown in Fig.3a is ηeﬀ vs. ˙γ at 30◦C, for ﬂuids in the os-
cillating and non-oscillating concentration ranges. Most
ﬂuids are shear thinning - ηeﬀ decreases at high enough
˙γ - however ﬂuids below 5 mM shear thicken (ηeﬀ in-
creases above η0), typically requiring ∼ 100 seconds to
reach steady state [9]. Bubbles tested in ﬂuids below 5
mM showed no oscillations or steady cusps. While there
is a noticeable diﬀerence in the rheology upon increas-
ing from 20 to 30 mM, 30 and 40 mM (type II region)
are strikingly similar; they also have a constant viscos-
ity over a broader ˙γ range than the other ﬂuids. More
interestingly, the zero shear viscosity η0 (deﬁned as the
plateau value at low ˙γ) decreases with concentration.

A more complete study of the dependence of η0 on ϕ in-
dicates transitions in ﬂuid microstructure (Fig.3b). The
transition at low concentration to rapid η0 growth marks
the overlap concentration ϕ∗ ≃ 3 mM, below which is the
dilute regime. Above ϕ∗ is the semi-dilute state, in which
micelles exist as individual entangled worms [22]. Here
η0 ∼ ϕ5.8, close to the value 5.4 associated with stress
relaxation by reptation [18, 23]. The semi-dilute regime
ends near ϕ ≃ 12 − 15 mM, followed by an extraordinary
decrease of η0 with concentration, continuing to ϕ ≃ 30
mM, after which η0 varies weakly.

The dramatic change in the concentration dependence
of η0 indicates a transition in the equilibrium ﬂuid struc-
ture, coinciding with the loss of type I oscillations. It may
be that the entangled micelles in the semi-dilute range
have begun to fuse at entanglement points, forming a
crosslinked network [18, 23, 24, 25]. The junction nodes
are free to slide along the micelles in such a formation,
which would account for the decrease in viscosity [18]. If
the ratio of crosslinks to entanglement points grows as
η0 decreases, then the new state would be fully formed
where η0 stabilizes near ∼ 30 mM (1%), the start of type
II oscillations. Note that a crosslinked network state has
also been proposed for CTAB/NaSal at ϕ ≃ 1% [26].

Transitions in micellar morphology would naturally
lead to transitions in mechanisms for stress relaxation,
which should be observable in the stress ﬁeld around the
rising bubble. These transitions are made evident with

birefringent visualization, shown in Fig.4 for the three
concentration regimes. Optical birefringence is a well-
known technique for visualizing stress in non-Newtonian
ﬂuids [27], especially eﬀective for wormlike micellar ﬂuids
[28]. Fig.4a (10 mM) shows the localization of stress in
the wake of a type I oscillating bubble. This birefringent
tail mirrors the dynamics of the bubble’s cusp (Fig.1),
and when it retracts, the birefringent tail suddenly dis-
perses to the sides. The ﬂow in the bubble wake is nearly
in uniaxial extension [29], and the birefringent tail sug-
gests a strong relation to a thin ﬁlament whose rupture
[10] may be related to the mechanism for oscillation. At
20 mM a shorter tail is seen (Fig.4b), whose length re-
mains constant (like the bubble tail). Fig.4c corresponds
to type II oscillations (35 mM), in which three equally
spaced birefringent bands indicate a broader distribution
of stress. This pattern is essentially unaltered during an
oscillation. Note that De decreases from type I to type
II, with an intermediate value for non-oscillating bub-
bles (Fig.4 caption), contradicting the implicit critical
De condition for oscillations in [12].

The length distribution of the individual worms in the
type I region (semi-dilute) should depend on temperature
and concentration. In equilibrium, the average length of
a wormlike micelle L0 can be described with the mean
ﬁeld approximation [2, 3, 21]:

L0(φ, T ) ∼ pφ eE/2kT

(1)

where φ is the total amphiphile concentration, k is Boltz-
mann’s constant, T is temperature, and E is the scis-
sion energy required to break one wormlike micelle into
two. Estimates based on light scattering measurements
for E are on the order of 10kT [2, 17, 30] - much lower
than the covalent bonds of polymers, yet large enough
for some micelles to reach appreciable lengths against
thermal ﬂuctuations [2]. The ﬂow near the bubble may
increase the equilibrium length, and there is evidence

4

that shear-induced structures (SIS) much larger than in-
dividual micelles form in such ﬂow in both CTAB/NaSal
[9, 31, 32] and CPCl/NaSal [33, 34]. We assume simply
that for the type I region, L0 is the relevant quantity
determining if the bubble will oscillate. Speciﬁcally, we
attribute the oscillations to a breaking instability of the
elongated micelles or SIS in the wake, occurring only if L0
exceeds some critical value. Using Eqn.1, the solid line in
Fig.2 corresponds to a scission energy of E = 1.01×10−19
Joules, about 24kT .

Type II oscillations have a much simpler dependence
on temperature; they occur only for T <∼ Tc = 36◦C
(Fig.2).
If crosslinks have indeed formed for T < Tc,
then the mean ﬁeld length is no longer an appropriate
quantity. The transition temperature Tc suggests a crit-
ical energy condition (Ec ≃ 4.3 × 10−21 Joules), which
may correspond to the energy diﬀerence between junc-
tions and endcaps. Thus for T > Tc, endcaps would
dominate and the ﬂuid is comprised of individual mi-
celles which can entangle like polymers. This possible
explanation is consistent with both the rheology and the
rising bubble dynamics.

The two diﬀerent oscillations we have observed appear
linked to two diﬀerent microstructures. We extended our
study to include the well characterized ternary system
CPCl-NaSal diluted in concentrated NaCl, with a ratio
[NaSal]/[CPCl] = 0.5 [8, 22, 35]. We tested several con-
centrations [36] of these ﬂuids for jumping bubbles in
our apparatus, at T = 30◦C, a temperature central to
both type I and II oscillations (Fig.2). We observed no

oscillations or any behavior diﬀerent from steadily ris-
ing bubbles in conventional polymeric ﬂuids [14]. This
classic ternary system is known to consist of entangled
wormlike micelles, which when taken with the observed
scaling η0 ∼ ϕ3.3, indicates that micellar breaking occurs
on a shorter timescale than reptation [2, 22]; in contrast
for our ﬂuids η0 ∼ ϕ5.8. Evidently, the oscillatory motion
of rising bubbles is not a characteristic of ﬂuids in this
“fast-breaking” limit [2, 37], and we conclude that type
I oscillations are in the “slow-breaking” limit.

Our study of rising bubbles in various wormlike mi-
cellar ﬂuids indicates that while scission reactions may
be necessary for oscillations, there are other conditions.
The discovery of a second type of oscillation provides
another example of how microscale dynamics and archi-
tecture (entangled vs. crosslinked) interact to produce
macroscopic instabilities.
It now seems that wormlike
micellar ﬂuids are the most generic complex ﬂuids as far
as rising bubbles are concerned, since all known material-
dependent dynamics can occur at diﬀerent temperatures
or concentrations. More surprisingly, the rise of an air
bubble has been shown to be extraordinarily sensitive to
ﬂuid microstructure.

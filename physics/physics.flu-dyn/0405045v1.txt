Abstract. We study generation of magnetic ﬁelds, involving large spatial scales,
by convective plan-forms in a horizontal layer. Magnetic modes and their growth
rates are expanded in power series in the scale ratio, and the magnetic eddy diﬀusivity
(MED) tensor is derived for ﬂows, symmetric about the vertical axis in a layer. For
convective rolls magnetic eddy correction is demonstrated to be always positive. For
rectangular cell patterns, the region in the parameter space of negative MED coincides
with that of small-scale magnetic ﬁeld generation. No instances of negative MED in
hexagonal cells are found. A family of plan-forms with a smaller symmetry group
than that of rectangular cell patterns has been found numerically, where MED is
negative for molecular magnetic diﬀusivity over the threshold for the onset of small-
scale magnetic ﬁeld generation.

Key words. Kinematic magnetic dynamo, magnetic modes, symmetric ﬂow,

asymptotic expansion, magnetic eddy diﬀusivity.

Introduction

The present work continues the series of studies of generation of magnetic ﬁeld pos-
sessing large spatial scales by Lanotte et al. (2000), Zheligovsky et al. (2001) and
Zheligovsky & Podvigina (2003). Space-periodic parity-invariant ﬂows, steady or pe-
riodic in time, which have an exponentially decaying spectrum, were considered by
these authors, regarded as a model for natural turbulent ﬂows of conducting ﬂuids.
For such ﬂows magnetic eddy diﬀusivity (MED) was found to be often negative. (The
analysis has been extended to the study of linear stability of space periodic magne-
tohydrodynamic steady states to long-period perturbations by Zheligovsky, 2003).

We consider here a kinematic dynamo problem in an inﬁnite layer, assuming

perfectly conducting horizontal boundaries:2

and generically there exist two neutral magnetic modes satisfying (5) and (1).

The conducting ﬂuid resides in an inﬁnite volume. When the spatial period of
magnetic ﬁeld is allowed to increase to inﬁnity, the smallest eigenvalue of the Lapla-
cian tends to zero – diﬀusive dissipation of slowly varying magnetic ﬁelds is small.
Therefore, the following question may be asked: Can a growing magnetic mode be
constructed by perturbing a neutral mode of the same periodicity as that of the ﬂow,
allowing larger spatial scales in the perturbation?

It was found in the studies cited above, that growing modes can indeed be con-
structed following this idea and using multiscale techniques. We show in the present
paper, that this remains true for magnetic ﬁeld generation in a layer. The mechanism
of negative MED for generation of large-scale magnetic ﬁeld requires that no α-eﬀect
is present. To ensure this, parity-invariant ﬂows have been considered in the earlier
studies.
In the present work a diﬀerent symmetry serves the same purpose – the
symmetry about the vertical axis:

In Section 2 we discuss expansions of magnetic modes and their growth rates
in power series in scale ratio, ǫ, which is a small parameter of the problem, and
present MED tensor for a general incompressible ﬂow in a layer satisfying (4) and
(6). A complete formal expansion of magnetic modes and the associated eigenvalues is
exposed in detail in Appendix A. In Section 3 we prove, that for plane ﬂows (and hence
for convective rolls) magnetic eddy correction is always positive. In the remaining part
of the paper results of Section 2 are applied to convective plan-forms; their properties
are summarised in Section 4. The plan-forms possess additional symmetries, for which
the MED tensor is diagonal, as discussed in Section 5. In Section 6 numerical results
for two families of plan-forms are presented. For rectangular cell patterns, the region
in the parameter space of negative MED coincides with that of small-scale magnetic
ﬁeld generation. A family of rectangular cells with a smaller symmetry group has
been found numerically, where MED is negative for molecular magnetic diﬀusivity
over the threshold for the onset of small-scale magnetic ﬁeld generation. In Appendix
B we consider more eﬃcient procedures for computation of MED, than direct numeric
solution of auxiliary problems arising in construction of the asymptotic series.

2. Magnetic eddy diﬀusivity tensor

for large-scale magnetic modes in a layer

We outline here construction of expansions of magnetic modes and their growth rates.
This is done under the basic assumption that a generic problem is considered, i.e. the
∗ is spanned by constant vector ﬁelds, whose vertical
kernel of the adjoint operator
component vanishes. In this Section a steady ﬂuid ﬂow v(x) is supposed
i. to satisfy the boundary conditions (4) and (6);
ii. to possess the symmetry (7);
iii. to have a zero space average of the horizontal components;
iv. to be solenoidal:

L

v = 0.

∇ ·
A magnetic mode H(x, y) is supposed to depend on the fast variable x

R3 and
on the slow variable y = ǫ(x1, x2) in horizontal directions. Here the scale ratio ǫ > 0
is a small parameter. A solution to the eigenvalue problem (2) is sought in the form
of power series in ǫ:

We assume in this Section, that the ﬂow does not depend on x2, and v2 = 0. (The
choice of the horizontal direction e2 is arbitrary, since e1 and e2 are interchangeable.)

4. Convective plan-form ﬂows in a layer

Analysis of Section 2 will be applied to convective plan-forms.
In this Section we
summarise their properties (see Chandrasekhar, 1981). Thermal convection in a ﬂuid
heated from below in a layer with no rotation is considered. Plan-forms are instability
modes (more precisely, the ﬂow parts of the modes) at the onset of instability of the
trivial steady state (in which the ﬂuid is at rest and the temperature proﬁle is linear
in x3). They are poloidal:

In the most general form (Bisshopp, 1960) the potential can be expressed as

v(x)

≡ ∇ × ∇ ×

(P (x)e3).

(24)

P (x)

≡

(α1 cos(L1x1) cos(L2x2) + α2 cos(pL2x2))w(x3).

where n > 0 is integer. The mode for n = 1 becomes unstable the ﬁrst, when the
Rayleigh number is increased. For rigid horizontal boundaries the vertical proﬁle is
more complicated (see Chandrasekhar, 1981).

Plan-forms possess two “reﬂection” symmetries, referred to in the next Section:

Each of the two reﬂection symmetries (28) and (29) splits the domain of
direct sum of two proper subspaces: symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the
given symmetry. (A vector ﬁeld is said to possess the reﬂection antisymmetry in the
direction e1, if it satisﬁes (28) with the reversed signs in the left-hand side:

a reﬂection antisymmetry in the direction e2 is deﬁned similarly.)

Consequently, due to (13) a solution Sk to the ﬁrst auxiliary problem has the
same reﬂection symmetries/antisymmetries, as the vector ﬁeld ∂v/∂xk. Furthermore,
due to (14) a solution Γmk to the second auxiliary problem has the same reﬂection
symmetries/antisymmetries, as ∂2v/∂xm∂xk.

In particular, Γkk possess both reﬂection symmetries and hence

As shown in the previous Section, to ﬁnd coeﬃcients of the MED tensor and thus

the minimal MED for a plan-form it appears necessary to solve 4 problems
two ﬁrst, and two second auxiliary problems (13) and (14). However, as discussed in
Appendix B, it suﬃces to solve 3 elliptic problems of the same complexity.

Computations have been performed for the ﬂows (24), (25) with the vertical proﬁle

w(x3) =

βn sin(nx3),

(31)

where βn are constant coeﬃcients. The ﬂows employed in computations are nor-
malised, so that the root mean square is equal to 1. All Figures below show results
obtained for plan-forms with the vertical proﬁle (27).

6.1 Fourier representation of the functions Sk and Γmk

Since solutions to the auxiliary problems possess the reﬂection symmetries (28) and
(29) (see Section 4) and satisfy the boundary conditions (1), they can be expanded
in the following Fourier series:

All computations have been performed with the resolution of 64 trigonometric
functions in each direction. With this resolution the energy spectrum of solutions
decays by several (at least 4) orders of magnitude.

The following parity symmetries each reduce twice the number of unknown coef-
ﬁcients. If in (25) p is odd or α2 = 0, the sum of horizontal wave numbers in the
velocity is even; hence vector ﬁelds constructed of harmonics, where the sum of the
wave numbers in the horizontal directions is either even or odd, constitute, respec-
. Therefore, if p is odd or α2 = 0,
tively, two invariant subspaces of the domain of
terms of the series (32)-(34) do not vanish only for even n1 + n2. Similarly, if in (31)
only odd wave-number terms are present, terms of the series (32)-(34) do not vanish
only for even n1 + n3.

6.2 MED for rectangular cell patterns

Rectangular thermal convection cell patterns are plan-forms (24), (25), where α2 = 0.
They possess the symmetry group of a rectangular.

magnetic mode which has a zero horizontal mean and the spatial periodicity of the

Matthews (1999a,b)3 found square plan-forms with L1 = L2 = 1/2 incapable of
kinematic dynamo action. He assumed the boundary conditions (1) and considered
magnetic modes with vectors of basic periods along the diagonals of our basic peri-
odicity square, with the periods equal to a half of the diagonal length (constituting a
subspace of our small-scale magnetic ﬁelds).

Figures 1 and 2 display MED computed for two sets of parameter values for
3Opposite to Matthews (1999a,b), we cannot recommend integration of the magnetic induction
equation in time as an eﬃcient technique for numerical determination of the dominant eigensolution
of (2) for steady ﬂows, at least unless the following improvements are implemented: 1) Spectral
discretisation of the induction equation in all three spatial variables is employed. 2) Integration of
the Fourier-Galerkin system of ODE’s for the induction equation is performed by fast specialised
time-stepping schemes overcoming stiﬀness of the system of ODE’s (e.g., see Chertovskih, 2004). 3)
Optimisation methods (e.g., similar to those of Zheligovsky, 1993) are employed, allowing one to
jump from the current trajectory of temporal evolution of a magnetic ﬁeld to a diﬀerent one, closer
to the exponential trajectory of the dominant magnetic mode. 4) Smallness of the discrepancy
is examined in the condition for termination of iterations, and not the “overall exponential

The Figures illustrate an unexpected phenomenon: The critical molecular viscos-
ity for the onset of small-scale magnetic ﬁeld generation coincides with that for the
onset of large-scale magnetic ﬁeld generation; i.e. the minimal MED vanishes together
with the growth rate of the dominant magnetic mode of the spatial periodicity of the
ﬂow. Since the growth rate of the large-scale magnetic mode is small (O(ǫ2)), the
large-scale magnetic instability is weak compared to the small-scale one.

L

This phenomenon has been reproduced in simulations for a number of vertical
proﬁles (31) comprised of up to three sines with wave numbers of the same or diﬀerent
parity. In these simulations the critical molecular diﬀusivities η have been determined
to the accuracy of at least 10−8. Algebraic reasons of this phenomenon are not entirely
clear.

Neutral small-scale modes obtained in computations have essentially the same
3 (cf. (30)); this can be
symmetries. Suppose the minimal MED is η
always achieved, since for α2 = 0 horizontal directions are interchangeable. Then
the neutral small-scale magnetic mode has the same reﬂection symmetries as Γ12,

and can be expanded in a Fourier series similar to (34). All non-vanishing terms in
this series correspond to wave vectors, n whose components have the parity either
(odd, even, even), or (even, odd, odd). This is in contrast with the Γ12 structure: it
is represented by the series (34) where all non-vanishing terms correspond to wave
vectors, all three components of which have the same parity.

Figure 3 displays MED computed for a family of non-rectangular cell patterns together

as in the ﬂow (the associated eigenvalues of
ratios α2/α1 has been detected, where MED is negative. For the assumed value of
molecular viscosity ﬂows from this family do not generate small-scale magnetic ﬁeld;
thus in this family of plan-forms the eﬀect of negative MED instability is separated
out.

L

For α2 = α1/2 the ﬂow is the Christopherson (1940) hexagonal cell pattern. Zhe-
ligovsky & Galloway (1998) found that in case there is a dielectric beyond one of
the horizontal boundaries of the layer, the ﬂow can generate small-scale magnetic
ﬁeld for small molecular diﬀusivities. Matthews (1999b) has not found magnetic ﬁeld
generation by hexagonal cells for L1 =
1/8, assuming the boundary
conditions (1) and (5). In addition, a number of computations for the hexagonal cell
q
pattern have been performed for two-term sums (31) and a varying ratio βn/β1, but
no instances of negative MED have been found.

7. Conclusion

Formal asymptotic expansions of magnetic modes and the associated eigenvalues in
series in the scale ratio have been constructed for ﬂows, symmetric about the vertical
axis. The volume where the ﬂows reside and their symmetries are diﬀerent from those
for parity-invariant space-periodic ﬂows, which have been considered so far. If a ﬂow
possesses reﬂection symmetries about the horizontal Cartesian axes, the magnetic
eddy diﬀusivity tensor becomes diagonal. The suggested strategies for evaluation
of elements of the MED tensor require numerical solution of a smaller number of
elliptic PDE’s, than for the direct approach whereby all auxiliary problems are solved.
Numerical experiments have been performed for convective plan-forms in the absence
of rotation, and a family of plan-forms exhibiting negative MED has been found;
these ﬂows cannot generate small-scale magnetic ﬁeld with the spatial periodicity of
the ﬂow. Therefore magnetic ﬁeld generation in a layer by the mechanism of negative
MED is possible. The ﬂows are poloidal, and their helicity vanishes identically. Thus,
the paradigm requiring helicity of a ﬂow to be non-zero to enable it to act as a dynamo
has been once again demonstrated to be wrong.

For ﬂows symmetric about the vertical axis in a layer, considered in this paper,
l = 3 and m, k = 1, 2. For parity-invariant space-periodic ﬂows, auxiliary problems
are represented by the same equations (13) and (14), but now l, m, k = 1, 2, 3. To
evaluate the MED tensor, the ﬁrst and second auxiliary problems were solved by
Lanotte et al. (2000), Zheligovsky et al. (2001) and Zheligovsky & Podvigina (2003).

Thus, it is in fact necessary to solve only one equation from the pair (46), (47),
e.g. (47) in which Al can be regarded as a notation for 1
Bl), since
η (
in the space of Fourier coeﬃcients computation of the inverse Laplacian is a simple
operation. After Bl and thus Al are determined, subsequently Sl and Zl can be found
from (48), and from (44)

However, computation of the left-hand side of (47) requires two inverse and two direct
FFT’s, and it is not clear without numerical tests, whether merging the problems
(44) and (13) into a single equation (47) with the notation (46) is computationally
advantageous.

If a space-periodic ﬂow possesses the “translation antisymmetry”:

for a constant vector a, solutions to the problem (13) can be obtained from solutions
to (44):

Abstract

We study the extended hydrodynamics proposed by Philip Rosenau [Phys. Rev. A 40, 7193

(1989)] in the context of a regularization of the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We are able to prove

that shock waves appear in ﬁnite time in Rosenau’s extended Burgers’ equation, and we discuss the

physical implications of this fact and its connection with a possible extension of hydrodynamics to

the short wavelength domain.

The Boltzmann equation is one of the most fundamental equations in Nonequilibrium

Statistical Mechanics. This equation describes the dynamics of a rareﬁed gas, taking into

account two basic processes: the free ﬂight of the particles and their collisions. Due to the

diﬃculties that a direct treatment of this equation implies, a reduced description of Boltz-

mann equation is one of the major problems in kinetic theory. Equations of hydrodynamics

constitute a closed set of equations for the three hydrodynamic ﬁelds: local density, local ve-

locity, and local temperature. These equations can be derived from Boltzmann equation by

performing the Chapman-Enskog expansion [1]. This expansion is a power series expansion

in the Knudsen number, that is the ratio of the free mean path between the macroscopic

length. The ﬁrst order of the expansion yields Euler equations, while the second order yields

Navier-Stokes equations which in the case of an incompressible ﬂuid read:

∂tv + (v · ∇)v = −∇p + µ∇2v

∇ · v = 0,

where µ represents the viscosity of the ﬂuid, and is of the order of the Knudsen number. The

next order in the Chapman-Enskog expansion yields the Burnett equations of hydrodynamics

which are, unfortunately, invalid. To see this more clearly consider the viscous part of the

Chapman-Enskog expansion:

ǫ(µ0∇2v + ǫ2µ1∇4v + ...),

where µ = ǫµ0, and ǫ is the Knudsen number. The Burnett order implies the presence of the

biharmonic term proportional to ∇4, that causes an unphysical increase in the number of

boundary conditions and rends the equilibrium unstable, among other undesirable eﬀects.

While the Navier-Stokes equations give very accurate results in many domains, they usually

fail when applied to predict the short wavelength properties of the ﬂuid, like, for instance,

the propagation of ultrasounds within the ﬂuid. This makes very useful to develop a higher

order description of the ﬂuid, while the Burnett order has proven itself less accurate than the

Navier-Stokes order. This problem was partially solved by Philip Rosenau in his inﬂuencing

article of 1989 [2]. The idea was to regularize the Chapman-Enskog expansion using a very

original comparison. First consider the power series expansion:

(1)

(2)

(3)

1
1 − z

= 1 + z2 + z4 + ...,

2

where z is a complex number which modulus fullﬁlls |z| < 1. Assuming that ǫ is small enough

and taking into account the power series (3) suggest that we can recast expansion (2) into

the form

µ∇2
1 − ǫ2m2∇2

v,

where m2 = µ1

µ0 , and this operator is to be interpreted in the Fourier transform sense:

µ∇2
1 − ǫ2m2∇2

(cid:18)

ˆ

=

v

(cid:19)

−µk2
1 + ǫ2m2k2 ˆv.

This idea was originally proposed in the context of random walk theory [3], and has been

used within this context in latter works [4].

While this regularization of the Chapman-Enskog expansion seems to be a proper exten-

sion of hydrodynamics in the linear regime [2], its eﬀect on the full nonlinear hydrodynamics

is not so clear. This is due to the analytical diﬃculties that a mathematical treatment of

the Navier-Stokes equations implie. However, it is useful to study some toy models to win a

deeper understanding of hydrodynamics; to this end was developed a one-dimensional model

for hydrodynamics: the Burgers’ equation

∂tu + u∂xu = µ∂2

xu.

In the same spirit, Rosenau considered the regularized Burgers’ equation, arguing that an

understanding of this model would clarify the eﬀect of the regularization of the Chapman-

Enskog expansion on the nonlinear hydrodynamics. The rest of this work is devoted to prove

the appearence of shock waves in ﬁnite time in Rosenau’s regularized Burgers’ equation, and

to analize the physical implications of this fact.

Rosenau’s extended Burgers’ equation reads:

∂tu + u∂xu = µ

∂2
x
1 − ǫ2∂2
x

u,

where we have set, without lost of generality, µ1/µ0 = 1. To prove shock wave formation we

will exploit the analogy between viscous Burgers’ equation (the inviscid Burgers’ equation

is obtained just by setting µ = 0) and the Keller-Segel system [5]:

∂tv = µ∂2

xv + ∂x(v∂xw),

∂2
xw = −v.

Note that we recover viscous Burgers’ equation performing the substitution u = ∂xw in

system (8,9). Consider now the following modiﬁed Keller-Segel system:

∂tv = µ

v + ∂x(v∂xw),

∂2
x
1 − ǫ2∂2
x

∂2
xw = −v.

We can recover Rosenau’s extended Burgers’ equation by performing again the substitution

u = ∂xw in this last system. We will consider homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions:

v|∂Ω = w|∂Ω = 0, where Ω is the closed interval Ω = [−L, L]. From system (10,11) we get:

Now, we are going to estimate all the terms appearing in the right hand side of this equation.

Integrating by parts the second term in the right hand side of Eq.(12):

where N =

(cid:12)
operator ∇2(1 − ∇2)−1 is bounded on every Lp space, with 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. This means that
(cid:12)
we can assure that ||∇2(1 − ∇2)−1f ||Lp(Ω) ≤ N ||f ||Lp(Ω) for every f belonging to Lp(Ω) and
a constant N that does not depend on f (and thus N is called the norm of the operator).

This fact can be easily seen once one realizes that the Fourier transform of the operator
∇2(1 − ∇2)−1 is a bounded function of the wavevector, and a rigorous proof can be found

in [6]. We can again shift variables x = ǫy to get:

Now we are going to estimate the third term in Eq.(12):

H¨older’s inequality reads (for a rigorous proof of H¨older’s inequality see [7]):

Choosing g = 1 we get:

where A, B > 0 are constants, A = |Ω|−1/2 and B = 2N µ

dynamical system:

= Ax3/2 − Bx.

This system has two ﬁxed points, x = 0 and x = (B/A)2 > 0. A linear stability analysis

reveals that the positive ﬁxed point is linearly unstable, meaning that every initial condition

x0 > (B/A)2 will stay above this value for all times. Further, we know that the solution will

grow without bound in this case, so we can claim the existence of two constants, t0 < ∞
and 0 < C0 < A, such that Ax3/2(t) − Bx(t) > C0x3/2(t) for every t > t0. This implies that

for t > t0, and for an adecuate initial condition. Solving this equation gives:

for t > t1 > t0, and for an adecuate initial condition. And every adecuate initial condition

must fullﬁll

like, for instance, v(x, 0) = (x2 + δ)−1/4 − (L2 + δ)−1/4 and δ small enough. Thus we are

ﬁnally led to conclude that the system does blow up in ﬁnite time. If we recover v = −∂xu

we see that the ﬁrst spatial derivative of u becomes singular in ﬁnite time. This means that

the solution to equation Eq.(7) develops a shock wave in ﬁnite time (or what is the same, a

discontinuity in the ﬂow appears), in contrast to the viscous Burgers’ equation and analo-

gously to the inviscid Burgers’ equation ∂tv = −v∂xv [7]. The inviscid Burguers’ equation is

a one-dimensional model for the Euler equations, while the viscous Burguers’ equation sim-

ulates the Navier-Stokes equations. This suggests that the regularizating procedure implies

a return to a lower order in the Chapman-Enskog expansion.

It was already argued by Rosenau that this kind of regularization of the Chapman-Enskog

expansion was only valid in the linear regime, while nonlinear terms might be present in

the full nonlinear hydrodynamics. These terms are expected to have a deep impact on

the dynamics of the ﬂuid, the reason being as follows. Whether or not the Navier-Stokes

equations become singular in ﬁnite time is still unkown and it is actually one of the most

important open problems in Mathematics. What one would expect from a physical point of

view is that these possible divergences smooth out if we look closer to the ﬂuid taking into

account higher order terms in a (complete) regularized Chapman-Enskog expansion. What

we have seen in this work is that the linear regularized theory is able to convert a smooth

solution into a singular one, so one would expect that a regularized Navier-Stokes equation

of the form:

∂tv + (v · ∇)v = −∇p + µ

∇2
1 − m2ǫ2∇2

v

∇ · v = 0

(29)

is less regular than the original Navier-Stokes equation. We expect the presence of this

nonlinear terms to regularize enough this equation that one would be able to prove global

existence in time of the solution, and this way give a precise physical meaning to the possible

divergences arising in the original Navier-Stokes equation.

Abstract
This paper extends our recent theoretical work concerning the feasibility of stable and accurate
computation of turbulence using a large eddy simulation [M. Ida and N. Taniguchi, Phys. Rev. E 68,
036705 (2003)]. In our previous paper, it was shown, based on a simple assumption regarding the
instantaneous streamwise velocity, that the application of the Gaussian ﬁlter to the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations can result in the appearance of a numerically unstable term that can be
decomposed into positive and negative viscosities. That result raises the question as to whether an
accurate solution can be achieved by a numerically stable subgrid-scale model. In the present paper,
based on assumptions regarding the statistically averaged velocity, we present similar theoretical
investigations to show that in several situations, the shears appearing in the statistically averaged
velocity ﬁeld numerically destabilize the ﬂuctuation components because of the derivation of a
numerically unstable term that represents negative diﬀusion in a ﬁxed direction. This ﬁnding can
explain the problematic numerical instability that has been encountered in large eddy simulations of
wall-bounded ﬂows. The present result suggests that this numerical problem is universal in large
eddy simulations, and that if there is no failure in modeling, the resulting subgrid-scale model
can still have unstable characteristics; that is, the known instability problems of several existing
subgrid-scale models are not something that one may remove simply by an artiﬁcial technique, but
must be taken seriously so as to treat them accurately.

INTRODUCTION

Turbulence is one of the unsolved problems of physics [1]. Because a complete theoretical
description has not yet been achieved even for a relatively simple ﬂow conﬁguration, numer-
ical simulations are commonly used as a powerful tool for analyzing turbulent ﬂows. Typical
numerical approaches include the direct numerical simulation (DNS), the Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS), and the large eddy simulation (LES). In DNS, all the scales of mo-
tion in the turbulent ﬂows are resolved by suﬃciently ﬁne computational grids, whereas in
RANS, only the evolution of mean quantities is solved. LES is an intermediate technique
between these approaches, directly solving the large scales but modeling small-scale eddies
by employing a subgrid-scale (SGS) model (or a subﬁlter-scale model) that approximately
accounts for the eﬀects of the small scales on the large scales [2]. Because LES enables us
to solve time-dependent large-scale turbulent ﬂow problems with a relatively small compu-
tational time and storage compared to those required for DNS, this technique has recently
been used not only for academic studies but also for practical industrial ﬂow computations
that need time-dependent solutions.

One of the major problems of LES is numerical instability. As is already known, several
existing SGS models (e.g., the tensor-diﬀusivity [3], the scale-similarity [4], and the dynamic
Smagorinsky [5] models), which have been constructed based on a ﬁltering procedure and the
statistical properties of turbulence, have a numerically unstable property, and hence some
artiﬁcial numerical treatments (e.g., smoothing or clipping of the SGS stress) have been
incorporated so as to guarantee numerical stability [2, 5, 6, 7, 8]. While the mechanisms of
these models’ unstable behaviors have been described in the literature (e.g., Refs. [2, 8, 9,
10, 11]), the underlying reason as to why the SGS models have an unstable property has, to
the authors’ knowledge, not yet been fully clariﬁed. To construct an excellent SGS model
that is free from artiﬁcial, unphysical numerical treatments and has applicability to a wide
range of ﬂow conﬁgurations with high accuracy and robustness, it is necessary to elucidate
the underlying mechanism of those unstable properties. Is this numerical problem caused by
a failure in modeling or by other factors? To answer this question, it should be meaningful
to consider a similar but idealized question, whether a completely accurate SGS model, if it
exists, would be numerically stable.

In Ref. [10], Leonard has shown that the tensor-diﬀusivity model, which was derived by
truncating an exact expansion series of the SGS stress terms and is thus exact under a cer-
tain condition, should behave unstably along the stretching directions of ﬂuid motion. This
unstable behavior results from the negative diﬀusivity of that model, which makes the gov-
erning equations ill-conditioned and leads to numerical instability when treated numerically
by, e.g., ﬁnite diﬀerence methods. Winckelmans et al. [8] have performed several numerical
experiments using the pure (and mixed) tensor-diﬀusivity model and have pointed out that
the model behaves unstably under a wall-bounded ﬂow condition, while it can provide a
stable result for turbulent isotropic decay. In a recent paper [12] we have shown theoret-
ically that the ﬁltering procedure, which is the most fundamental component of LES, is
a potential seed of the numerical instability in LES [12]. Without having resorted to any
SGS model, but based on a simple assumption regarding the streamwise component of ﬂow
velocity, we found that under a wall-bounded ﬂow condition, the application of a Gaussian
ﬁlter (one of the ﬁlters commonly used in LES [13]) to the Navier-Stokes equations results
in the appearance of a numerically unstable term, a cross-derivative of the ﬁltered veloc-
ity component, which can be decomposed into diﬀusion and negative-diﬀusion terms. The

above ﬁndings indicate that apparently the application of Gaussian ﬁltering stabilizes the
physical properties of the governing equations, but this is not always the case. That result
implies that even a completely accurate SGS model that perfectly reproduces the physical
properties of the true SGS components might not always be numerically stable.

However, both Leonard’s and Ida and Taniguchi’s theoretical works are insuﬃcient to
fully clarify the mechanism of numerical stabilities in actual simulations. While those studies
have only considered the instantaneous nature of the SGS model or of the SGS forces, it
is possible that their time-averaged nature is dissipative and that stable simulations can
thus be achieved. Indeed, as mentioned above, the tensor-diﬀusivity model, which has an
unstable property, can provide stable solutions for an isotropic turbulent ﬂow [8]. This
observation suggests that further eﬀorts must be made to improve our understanding of the
numerical instabilities in LES.

In the present paper, we have extended our previous work so as to obtain more acceptable
and reliable results and to show that this numerical problem is universal in LES based on
Gaussian ﬁltering. We have previously assumed that the instantaneous value of the stream-
wise velocity component is linearly proportional to the distance from a plane wall parallel to
the bulk ﬂow. In contrast, in the present paper our discussion assumes that the statistically
averaged streamwise velocity component is linearly proportional to the distance from the
wall, an assumption that is more realistic because this is the case of a viscous sublayer form-
ing near a plane wall. Furthermore, we discuss cases where an axisymmetric swirl exists in
the statistically averaged velocity ﬁeld. As will be shown in the following section, a numeri-
cally unstable term with a time-independent coeﬃcient can appear in both situations. This
term is always unstable in a ﬁxed range of directions, while the previously discussed unstable
characteristics of the SGS terms and of the model depend on the directions of instantaneous
stretching [10] or of instantaneous shears [12]. Therefore, the present theoretical result can
more accurately explain the numerical instabilities frequently encountered in inhomogeneous
ﬂows that involve a strong steady shear in the mean velocity ﬁeld.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II B we reexamine the wall-bounded ﬂow case,
and in Sec. II C we extend our theory to swirling ﬂow cases. In the appendixes, we provide
additional notes on further extensions of our theory. Section III presents concluding remarks.

Suppose that x1, x2, and x3, respectively, are the streamwise, the wall-normal, and the
0. Decomposing the velocity

spanwise directions, and a plane solid wall is set for x2 ≤
components into the statistically averaged value Ui and ﬂuctuation part u′

i, we have

where Ui is assumed to not depend on time. Furthermore, we assume that

with β being a real constant, i.e., the mean streamwise velocity is linearly proportional to
the distance from the wall.
(The extension to more general cases is brieﬂy discussed in
Appendix A.) Based on these assumptions, one knows

Substituting Eqs. (12) and (13) into the convection terms in the equation for u1 and using

Eq. (14), we have

ui(x, t) = Ui(x) + u′

The second-to-the-last term of Eq. (19) is a cross-derivative of the dependent variable ¯u′
1. As
has been proved in several studies (e.g., Refs. [12, 15]), the derivatives of this type should be
numerically unstable when, for instance, a ﬁnite diﬀerence technique is adopted for solving
the equation. In what follows, we consider the stability condition for Eq. (19).

The last three terms of Eq. (19) may make a dominant contribution to the numerical
stability of LES. We will ﬁrst focus our attention on the second- and third-to-the-last terms:

From this, it can be seen that the following restriction is required to ensure that Eq. (22) is
a positive viscosity:

The shear gradient β may have diﬀerent values depending on the problems considered.
We consider here a simple example to show concretely how restriction (23) works in a
realistic situation. As is well known, in the viscous sublayer of turbulent channel ﬂows, the
statistically averaged streamwise velocity follows [17]

with uτ being the wall-friction velocity. Using Eq. (24) and rewriting reduce Eq. (23) to

where the superscript + denotes a quantity in the wall units. For γ = 6, this result cor-
responds to the stability condition derived by Kobayashi and Shimomura from the tensor-
diﬀusivity term in a dynamic SGS model [11].

(See Ref. [12].) Nevertheless, this incomplete condition creates a strong restriction on the
grid width (h). The grid width should satisfy h+
2.4 for ∆+ = 2h+, a setting that
has frequently been used, or h+
1.2 for ∆+ = 4h+, which is necessary for the
contribution of the SGS force to be signiﬁcant compared to the truncation and aliasing errors
of a second-order ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme [18]. (We should note here that this restriction is
imposed only on the grid width in the wall-normal direction because only the ﬁltering in this
direction yields the cross-derivative term, as mentioned already.) This result implies that at
least several grid points are needed in the viscous sublayer to guarantee numerical stability,
which is a formidable restriction in practical applications of a large-scale high-Reynolds-
number turbulent ﬂow. It is known that when the inner layer of turbulent boundary-layer
ﬂows is resolved, the number of grid points required for LES exceeds current computational
capacities even at moderate Reynolds numbers, and hence developments of SGS models that
are applicable to a coarse wall-normal grid and of wall models that do not need a strong
reﬁnement of the near-wall grids are the most pressing issues of LES; see a recent review by
Piomelli and Balaras [19]. The numerical problem that we have suggested above provides a
taste of the diﬃculties of constructing an excellent model.

The stability condition presented above would be partly weakened if the last term of
Eq. (19) is modeled using an eddy-viscosity model. However, this treatment does not al-
ways achieve a stable solution. Actually, Winckelmans et al. [8] have observed by numerical
experiments that for a plane channel ﬂow, a dynamic mixed model based on the tensor-
diﬀusivity model (which can accurately represent the characteristics of second-order cross
derivatives [11]) generates numerical instabilities that eventually make the numerical simu-
lation blow up. To remove those instabilities, they were forced to add an artiﬁcial damping
coeﬃcient to the tensor-diﬀusivity portion.
In the mixed model that they used, the co-
eﬃcient of eddy-viscosity part was well tuned by a dynamic procedure. Essentially the
same observations of the numerical instability of the dynamic mixed model can be found
in Ref. [11] by Kobayashi and Shimomura.
In those studies, the wall-normal grid width
was set to be several times larger than that used in DNS. That is, those studies suggest
that, for a large grid (and ﬁlter) width, which is much-needed in practical applications,
the addition of an eddy-viscosity term does not always guarantee numerical stability. If,
on the other hand, all the SGS terms are modeled using an eddy-viscosity model whose
coeﬃcient is guaranteed to be positive, the numerical stability of the ﬁltered system would
be guaranteed in many cases. However, it has been suggested by many researchers that
eddy-viscosity models have several deﬁciencies that make the LES results suspicious (e.g.,
Refs. [2, 9, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]). For instance, as has frequently been demonstrated
by a priori tests using DNS techniques, the SGS quantities modeled using eddy-viscosity
models do not correlate well with the actual SGS quantities [2, 9, 20, 23, 26], implying that
these models have low accuracy and/or narrow applicability. Indeed, in the present case the
eddy-viscosity models cannot describe the cross-derivative term in Eq. (19), which is a hy-
brid of positive and negative diﬀusions. Moreover, eddy-viscosity models were constructed
under the assumptions that the subgrid turbulence is isotropic and the ﬁlter scale is in an

7

inertial range, assumptions that are in general both violated in inhomogeneous turbulent
ﬂows, especially near walls. Furthermore, the dynamic types of eddy-viscosity models need
artiﬁcial techniques for smoothing the model coeﬃcient and for clipping its negative values
[2, 5, 6, 7, 27]. Based on the above, we consider the eddy-viscosity models to be insuﬃcient.
Most of the recent eﬀorts at SGS modeling have been devoted to developing a model that
does not strongly rely on eddy-viscosity models [7, 8, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31]. Models based on
a kind of “deﬁltering” procedure [25, 29, 30] are one such approach, determining signiﬁcant
portions of the SGS terms by an analytical, not empirical, procedure. The mixed models
based on the tensor-diﬀusivity term [7, 8, 31] can also be categorized into this type [26]. We
should note here that attempts to improve eddy-viscosity models are also being continued;
see, e.g., Refs. [24, 27, 32, 33].

It is worth noting that the numerical stability of the cross-derivative term in Eq. (19)
is time-independent, as this term always reveals a negative diﬀusivity in a ﬁxed range of
directions, whereas the numerical stability of the last term of the same equation may be
time-dependent. As mentioned in Sec. I, Winckelmans et al. have pointed out that the
numerical stability of the tensor-diﬀusivity model depends on the problems that they have
considered; obtaining stable results is diﬃcult to achieve for a strongly inhomogeneous (wall-
bounded) ﬂow, even when an eddy-viscosity term is added, but is possible for a homogeneous
ﬂow even by the pure tensor-diﬀusivity model [8]. They have explained these results as
follows: For the homogeneous ﬂow, the direction in which the tensor-diﬀusivity term reveals
the negative diﬀusivity evolves continuously in time and space, and hence the model term
may be dissipative on time average. However, in the inhomogeneous ﬂow case, long-lived
negative diﬀusion events can take place near the wall, leading to numerical instability and a
resulting divergence of the solution. As mentioned above, those numerical ﬁndings indicate
an inadequacy of the previous stability analyses by Leonard [10] and by Ida and Taniguchi
[12], which have only considered the instantaneous behavior of the SGS model or the SGS
term. The present theoretical ﬁndings, showing the appearance of a term that is always
numerically unstable in ﬁxed directions and hence is unstable on time-average as well, can
more correctly explain the problematic numerical instability encountered in the simulations
of plane channel ﬂows [8, 11].

C. Swirling ﬂow

Turbulent ﬂows involving a large-scale swirl are of practical importance in connection
with combustion engineering, aeroacoustics, meteorology, and so on.
In this subsection,
we discuss the LES of turbulent ﬂows having a rotating mean velocity about the x3 (or z)
axis, and show that the existence of the swirl can cause numerical instability through the
Gaussian ﬁltering operation.

First, we consider a very simple case in which the swirl has a constant angular velocity;

that is, the mean velocity takes the form of

where α is a real constant. This mean velocity satisﬁes

αx1, 0),

where we used Eq. (10) and assumed r
∆r so that the value of the Gaussian ﬁlter is
suﬃciently close to zero at r = 0. No unstable term appears in Eq. (37). Even when the
Gaussian ﬁlter is applied in both the r and θ directions, almost the same formula is obtained
because Uθ depends only on r. Speciﬁcally, in the present case the resulting formula is not,
unlike the previous case, dependent on how the Gaussian ﬁlter is applied.

≫

The above results, which reveal that the numerical stability of LES depends not only on
the ﬂow conﬁguration but also on the ﬁltering strategy and coordinate system adopted, can
be interpreted as follows: As has been shown in Ref. [12] and in the preceding subsection,
the existence of a shear leads to the appearance of a numerically unstable term. Although
no shear exists in the mean ﬂow proﬁle described by Eq. (26), a virtual shear is observed
when the Gaussian ﬁlter is applied only in one direction in the Cartesian coordinate (x1 or
x2), resulting in the derivation of the cross-derivative term. This problem does not arise for
the cylindrical coordinate, since the mean convection velocity in the (r, θ) space,

is uniform.

Lastly, we consider a case where the mean velocity has a second-order term, i.e., assuming

U(r, θ, z) = (0, α1r + α2r2, 0),

(38)

10

where α1 and α2 are real constants. Substituting this into the ﬁrst term on the RHS of
Eq. (36) and applying the Gaussian ﬁlter in the r direction, we have

(40)

The last term of Eq. (40) is a cross derivative of the dependent variable and should destabilize
the numerical solution, whereas the second-to-the-last term represents convection in the θ
direction that can be solved stably. For α2 = 0, the RHS terms of Eq. (40) vanish, and this
equation corresponds to Eq. (37). More speciﬁcally, the instability in this case is due to the
second-order component in the mean velocity, which violates the uniformity of the angular
velocity and thus represents a shear.

As in the plane-channel case, the cross-derivative terms derived above have a time-
independent coeﬃcient and thus should lead to numerical instability if an unsuitably large
ﬁlter is adopted. The present results imply that such an unstable term can appear in many
situations. In a future paper, we will consider more general and complicated ﬂow conﬁg-
urations to create a generalized theory of numerical instability due to ﬁltering operations
[34].

III. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In summary, we have theoretically investigated the numerical instability of LES caused
by the ﬁltering procedure based on simple assumptions regarding the statistically averaged
velocity, and have shown that Gaussian ﬁltering yields a numerically unstable term, which
always reveals a negative diﬀusivity in a ﬁxed range of directions in cases of both plane
channel ﬂow and swirling ﬂow. This conclusion conﬁrms and extends that of our previous
work [12]. We anticipate that it would be interesting to examine the relationship between
this numerical instability and the shear-induced (physical) instabilities in turbulence [35, 36].
Furthermore, we have presented several additional ﬁndings. In Sec. II B, we showed that
in channel-ﬂow case, this numerical problem strongly restricts the wall-normal grid width
necessary for achieving stable and accurate solutions. In the academic computations of a
plane channel ﬂow using an LES technique, the grid width in the wall-normal direction has
sometimes been set to almost the same as that required in DNS, and no ﬁlter is adopted
in this direction (e.g., Refs. [5, 20, 21, 28, 32]); the present result provides a grounding
for this custom. Furthermore, this result indicates a signiﬁcant diﬃculty in developing an
excellent SGS model that can provide satisfactory (i.e., not only stable but also accurate)
solutions, even with large wall-normal ﬁlter widths, which is seriously desired in practical
applications of high- (and even moderate-) Reynolds-number turbulence. In Sec. II C, based

11

on investigations of swirling ﬂow cases, we pointed out that the numerical stability of the
ﬁltered equations depends not only on the ﬂow conﬁguration, but also on the dimension
of the Gaussian ﬁltering and the adopted coordinate system. This ﬁnding would be of
particular importance in practical applications that use a general curvilinear coordinate
system or unstructured grids.

In the present study (and also in our previous paper), it was assumed implicitly that
all the spectral modes contained in the velocity ﬁeld are fully resolved because the Gaus-
(See
sian ﬁlter does not cut oﬀ any modes, but only damps the high-frequency modes.
Appendix B, which presents a related remark concerning cases where the spectral cutoﬀ
or the top-hat ﬁlter is employed, both of which eliminate certain modes.) The present re-
sults therefore indicate that even in such an ideal case, the complete SGS model (or, more
precisely, the complete subﬁlter-scale model whose characteristic length is determined inde-
pendently from the grid width), which can completely reproduce the properties of real SGS
stresses, can be numerically unstable when treated numerically, since the complete model
perfectly describes the characteristics of the unstable cross-derivative term. This problem
poses a dilemma for practitioners of LES who are looking for an accurate and stable SGS
model. To improve model accuracy, this numerical instability problem should be confronted.
However, if a rough, artiﬁcial treatment is adopted for stability, the accuracy of the LES
results will not be guaranteed. A potential approach to overcoming this diﬃculty is, as
suggested in our previous paper [12], to construct a stable and accurate numerical solver
for the numerically unstable term, though this would admittedly be quite a diﬃcult task.
(Leonard [10] and Moeleker and Leonard [37] have proposed Lagrangian methods based on
the tensor-diﬀusivity model and an anisotropic particle scheme to solve the negative-diﬀusion
problems, and have achieved stable solutions for a two-dimensional scalar transport equa-
tion with known velocity ﬁelds. However, several issues remain to be overcome to extend
those methods to the case of Navier-Stokes turbulence [37].) Further careful and vigorous
considerations are necessary for this instability problem to be solved.

APPENDIX A: CLOSURE FOR HIGH-ORDER MEAN VELOCITY

As a ﬁrst step toward constructing a general theory for the ﬁltering instability, let us

consider the closure of

ﬁlter is applied in the x2 direction. Using the Taylor expansion, the arbitrary function U1(x2)

APPENDIX B: SPECTRAL CUTOFF AND TOP-HAT FILTERS

In Ref. [14], Klimas showed that the Gaussian ﬁltered Vlasov equation can be rewritten
into a closed form in terms of the ﬁltered distribution function without any approximation.
Also, in Ref. [38] (see also Refs. [10, 26]) Yeo showed that the Gaussian ﬁltered Navier-
Stokes equations are written in a closed form having an inﬁnite series. Their results have
been utilized in our study, as described in the present and previous papers. This Appendix
is devoted to showing that when the spectral cutoﬀ or the top-hat ﬁlter is adopted, it is in
general impossible to analytically derive an exact, closed formula.

Let us consider two arbitrary velocity ﬁelds

whose spectra are

although the unﬁltered velocities have diﬀerent high-wavenumber modes. This unacceptable
conclusion has resulted from the assumption that a closed formula exists.

If, on the other hand,

u(1)(x) = u(2)(x) + cos(kx2)i
is true at an instant (where k is a constant wavenumber and i denotes the unit vector in
the x1 direction) and the wavelength of the cosine function in this equation is, for example,
equal to the ﬁlter width of the top-hat ﬁlter applied (at least) in the x2 direction, then

u(1)(x) = u(2)(x)

for all x.

not equal to zero for all k, ﬁltering diﬀerent velocity ﬁelds results in diﬀerent ﬁltered velocity
ﬁelds.

The present conclusion is in opposition to the theoretical result of Carati et al. [26] which
proved mathematically the existence of a closed formula in the top-hat case. Let us consider
the cause of this discrepancy. In the study of Carati et al., it was ﬁrst assumed that the
generalized expansion series for one-dimensional ﬁltering in the x direction takes the form
of

(ab) =

crs∂r

x¯a∂s
x

¯b,

∞

r,s=0
X

(B1)

where a and b are arbitrary, continuous, and diﬀerentiable functions of x and crs are real
constants. We show here that this assumption is not always valid for top-hat ﬁlters. If a
is a sinusoidal wave whose wavelength is equal to the characteristic width of the applied
top-hat ﬁlter, then ¯a(x) = 0 for any value of x and consequently the right-hand side of
Eq. (B1) is also equal to zero for any x if crs are ﬁnite values. However, the left-hand side

14

of this equation is not necessarily zero under the present conditions; if, for example, b = a,
then ab
0 for any x and thus (ab) > 0. This contradiction is caused by the fact that
the value of the top-hat ﬁlters can be zero in the Fourier space. The generating function,
Eq. (3.7) of Ref. [26] used to derive the generalized expansion series, is deﬁnable only for the
ﬁlters that always have a non-zero value in the Fourier space as Gaussian ﬁlters, because
that function diverges at the wavenumbers for which the ﬁlter value is zero. Therefore, the
expansion series for top-hat ﬁlters is deﬁnable only if the ﬁlter width is smaller than the
smallest resolved scale. When this restriction is not fulﬁlled, the expansion series should not
converge.

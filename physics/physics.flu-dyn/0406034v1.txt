(Dated: February 20, 2014)

Two-dimensional free-surface potential ﬂows of an ideal ﬂuid over a strongly inhomogeneous bot-
tom are investigated with the help of conformal mappings. Weakly-nonlinear and exact nonlinear
equations of motion are derived by the variational method for arbitrary seabed shape parameterized
by an analytical function. The band structure of linear waves over periodic bottoms is calculated.

INTRODUCTION

formulas

The classical problem of water waves over a variable
seabed has attracted much attention (see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25] and references therein). There are some signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerences in this interesting and practically impor-
tant problem, as compared to the theory of waves on a
deep water or in canals with a ﬂat horizontal bottom. In
the situations where the ﬂuid depth is less or of the same
order as a typical length of the surface wave, the inhomo-
geneity of the bottom is a reason for linear and nonlinear
wave scattering and transformation, and it strongly af-
fects the wave propagation. These phenomena occur so
widely that one can meet them almost everywhere, al-
though with diﬀerent scales. Examples of strongly non-
linear dynamics are ocean waves running on a beach, or
the motion of disturbed water in a puddle after a car.
Among the linear eﬀects due to the bottom topography
is the existence of special edge-localized waves discovered
by Stokes [12, 13, 14, 15], that propagate along the shore
line of a beach. Over an axially symmetric underwater
hill, quasi-localized wave modes with non-zero angular
momentum can exist, similar to the long-life-time states
of a quantum particle conﬁned by a potential barrier of a
ﬁnite width [6, 26]. It is necessary to say that underwater
obstacles of deﬁnite shapes and sizes can serve as waveg-
uides (a narrow and long underwater crest) or as lenses
(an oblong underwater hill oriented crosswise to the wave
propagation). A qualitative explanation for all the lin-
ear eﬀects is simple. Indeed, let r
be the coordinate in
⊥
the horizontal plane, H(r
) the depth corresponding to
⊥
quiet surface. Then, looking at the well known dispersion
relation for small-amplitude gravitational surface waves,

ω(K, H) =

gK tanh(KH)

(1)

p

(where ω is the frequency, K is the absolute value of
the wave vector, g is the gravitational acceleration), one
can see that the local refraction index n(ω, r
) increases
⊥
as the depth H(r
) decreases, in accordance with the

where the function K(ω, H) is determined by Eq. (1).
Therefore, as in the conventional light optics, here an
oblique wave changes its direction of propagation when
meets gradient of n. Also, the total internal reﬂection
is possible in propagation from smaller depth to larger
depth.

Besides observing such natural phenomena, a set of
laboratory experiments has been carried out to investi-
gate various aspects of given problem in more idealized
and controlled conditions than are achieved in nature
[14, 15, 22]. In particular, the waves over locally peri-
odic bottoms were studied experimentally [22], and such
a general for periodic media eﬀect was observed as the
Bragg resonances and the corresponding band structure
with gaps in the wave spectrum. It is worth to say that in
natural conditions quasi-periodic sand bars occur quite
often.

In general, a qualitative picture of the mentioned phe-
nomena is clear. As concerning the quantitative side of
the mathematical theory of waves over a variable bot-
tom, here not everything what necessary has been done,
because practically all developed up to now analytical
models and methods are related to the limit cases where
the ﬂuid is considered as ideal, and the slope of the bot-
tom is small (or the amplitude of the bottom undulations
is small). For the general three-dimensional (3D) Hamil-
tonian theory of water waves, such limitation seems to
be unavoidable even in considering the most simple, irro-
tational ﬂows when the state of the system is described
by the minimally possible set of functions, namely by a
pair of canonically conjugated quantities as the devia-
tion η(r
, t) of the free surface from the horizontal plane
⊥
and the boundary value ψ(r
, t) of the velocity poten-
⊥
tial [27, 28]. A technical diﬃculty exists here that, when
working in 3D space, it is impossible to represent in con-
venient and compact form the kinetic energy functional
which is a part of the Hamiltonian of the system. Small
values of the bottom slope and of the free surface slope

make possible expansion of the Hamiltonian to asymp-
totic series and subsequent application of various variants
of the perturbation theory. In such traditional approach,
an inhomogeneous bottom does not allow to write in ex-
act form even linearized equations, not speaking about
nonlinear corrections.

There are more favorable preconditions for develop-
ment of the theory for 2D potential ideal ﬂows with a
free boundary, and the reason for this is the possibility
to employ such powerful mathematical tools as analyti-
cal functions and the corresponding conformal mappings.
Time-dependent conformal mappings were successfully
used for studying strongly nonlinear 2D wave dynam-
ics on deep water and over straight horizontal bottom
[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. In the cited works the re-
gion occupied by resting ﬂuid (the lower half-plane or a
horizontal stripe) was mapped onto the region with the
disturbed free boundary, and the real axis was trans-
formed into the moving boundary. Such a conformal
“straightening” of the free surface has provided a com-
pact representation for the Hamiltonian, derivation of
exact equations of motion, and possibility for precise nu-
merical simulations of the system evolution.

The purpose of this work is to study the eﬀect of
strongly undulating bottom on 2D potential ﬂows of an
ideal ﬂuid with a free surface. Here conformal mappings
are also used, and this is done in two variants. In the
ﬁrst, “moderate” variant (Sec. 2), a ﬁxed conformal map-
ping “straightens” the bottom, but not the free bound-
ary. More exactly: instead of the Cartesian coordinates x
and y (the y-axis is up-directed), curvilinear coordinates
u and v are introduced, and the change of the coordinates
is performed with the help of an analytical function z(w)
which maps the stripe −1 < Im w < 0 onto the region be-
tween the horizontal line y = 0 and the inhomogeneous
bottom y = −H(x).
In this case x + iy = z(u + iv),
the horizontal line y = 0 corresponds to v = 0, and
on the bottom v = −1. The bottom may have arbi-
trary large slope and even impending peaces where the
dependence H(x) is multi-valued, as shown in Fig.1. The
shape of the free surface will be described by the func-
tion v = V (u, t). The Lagrangian for weakly-nonlinear
waves is represented as an integral series in powers of the
dynamical variables V (u, t) and ψ(u, t), with coeﬃcients
explicitly depending on the spatial coordinate u. In the
small-amplitude limit, the wave dynamics is described by
linear integral-diﬀerential equations. It is using the con-
formal variables u and v, that allows us to obtain these
equations in exact form, contrary to the traditional ap-
proach where even linearized equations can be obtained
only approximately by expansion in the small parame-
ter, the slope of the bottom. The deﬁnition “moderate”
for this variant emphasizes that straightening of the bot-
tom without straightening the free boundary is able to
provide not more than a weakly-nonlinear theory. Never-
theless, such a theory seems to be helpful and applicable
in many practical cases. The results of this part of the
work are the derivation of the Hamiltonian functional for

weakly-nonlinear potential surface waves in canals hav-
ing arbitrary bottom shape, as well as calculations for
the band structure of the spectrum for a number of pe-
riodic bottom proﬁles. As an example of treatment the
linearized equations, also the problem is considered of
wave reﬂection on a smooth “step” – changing the depth
from h1 to h2.

The other variant of using the conformal mappings
may be called “radical”, since it is an exact combined
theory where the time-dependent conformal mapping
straightens both the bottom and the free boundary (Sec.
3). Such mapping can be represented as the result of
two mappings: x + iy = z(ζ(w, t)), where the ﬁrst func-
tion ζ(w, t) maps the horizontal stripe −1 < v < 0
onto the region Dζ(t) with the straight lower boundary
(Im ζ = −1) and with a perturbed upper boundary, af-
ter that the time-independent function z(ζ) maps the
half-plane Im ζ > −1 onto the region y > −H(x) in the
physical plane bounded from below by the bottom. The
shape of the free surface will be described by the formula
X + iY = Z(u, t) = z(ζ(u, t)). However, it appears that
exact nonlinear equations for Z(u, t) in the inhomoge-
neous case have the same form as the known equations
for waves over a horizontal bottom [32], but with diﬀerent
requirements imposed on the solutions. Since the waves

on deep water are now eﬃciently simulated [34, 35], there
is a hope that in near future numerical solutions for waves
over undulating bottom will be obtained as well.

Here the linear Hermitian operator [ˆk tanh ˆk] has been
introduced, acting as

II. WEAKLY-NONLINEAR THEORY

So, suppose we know the analytical function z(w) =
x(u, v) + iy(u, v) which maps the horizontal stripe −1 <
Im w < 0 onto the region occupied by the ﬂuid at rest,
and this function takes real values on the real axis:
z(u) = x(u, 0). The velocity ﬁeld is irrotational, and the
velocity potential ϕ(u, v) satisﬁes the Laplace equation
ϕuu + ϕvv = 0 in the ﬂow region −1 < v < V (u, t), with
the boundary conditions ϕv|v=
1 = 0, ϕ|v=V (u) = ψ(u).
Due to the conformal invariance of the Laplace equation
in 2D-space, hence the equation ϕxx + ϕyy = 0 is satis-
ﬁed as well, with the no-penetration boundary condition
on the bottom: ∂ϕ/∂n|y=
H(x) = 0. Let us now take
−
into account the fact that the Lagrangian functional for
the potential surface waves has the following structure
[27, 28, 32]:

where Y (u, t) = y(u, V (u, t)), X(u, t) = x(u, V (u, t)),
and the Hamiltonian functional H is the total energy
of the system – the sum of the kinetic energy and the
potential energy in the gravitational ﬁeld (in this paper
we neglect the surface tension eﬀects, though they can
be easily incorporated by adding to the Hamiltonian the
surface energy). In our variables

Let us expand the Lagrangian (3) in powers of the dy-
namical variables. It is clear that due to the symmetry
principle the expansion for y(u, v) contains only the odd
powers of v, while the expansion for x(u, v) contains only
the even powers of v. Therefore up to the third order the
Lagrangian (3) is equal to

in the ﬁrst integral in r.h.s. The expansion for the kinetic

performed in a standard manner [28, 32] and gives

and [ˆk sinh ˆk] in powers of ˆk2 = −(d/du)2.

any singularities at −1 < Im w < 1. The equation for
eigen-functions ψλ(u) (where λ = ω2h/g) now has the

(27)

where Ψν1 are Ψν2 are tied if the diﬀerence between ν1
ν2 is an integer number. Let us ﬁx some ν. Nontrivial
solutions of the system (27) exist only at deﬁnite values
λm(ν), where m = 1, 2, 3, . . .. It is necessary to note that
the functions λm(ν) are periodic: λm(ν + 1) = λm(ν),
and even: λm(−ν) = λm(ν). This determines the band
structure of the spectrum with the frequency gaps (see
Figs.1-2). For numerical computing λm(ν) it is neces-
sary to cut the inﬁnite chain (27) at some large but ﬁ-
nite length, thus considering only ν between −N and N .
Practically N should be several times larger than the in-
dex m of λm. The numerical results shown in the ﬁgures
were obtained with the help of the mathematical package
Maple 8.

One can see that even for strongly undulating bottom
the coeﬃcients an with n ≥ 1 can be small.
In this
case it is easy to calculate analytically in the main ap-
proximation positions of the gaps. For example, let us
consider the bottom proﬁle as in Fig.2, where x′(u) =
h(1 + 2ǫ cos(αu)). The gaps in spectrum correspond to
the integer or half-integer ν. It is important that at these
values of ν, solutions of the linear chain (27) possess def-
ν = ±Ψν. This allows
inite parity, in the sense that Ψ
us in gap calculation consider only positive ν. Let us
ﬁrst consider the half-integer ν and the corresponding
half-inﬁnite chain

−

(λ − F1/2)Ψ1/2 + λǫ(±Ψ1/2 + Ψ3/2) = 0,
(λ − F3/2)Ψ3/2 + λǫ(Ψ1/2 + Ψ5/2) = 0,
(λ − F5/2)Ψ5/2 + λǫ(Ψ3/2 + Ψ7/2) = 0,

(28)
(29)
(30)

. . .

Obviously, the even and odd cases result in diﬀerent λ’s,
and it is this diﬀerence that determines the gaps in the
spectrum. For the main-order calculation of the ﬁrst and

the third gaps, we cut this chain: Ψ7/2 = 0, Ψ9/2 = 0,
and so on. Now we have to solve the equation for zeros
of the determinant 3 × 3

[{λ(1 ± ǫ) − F1/2}(λ − F3/2) − λ2ǫ2](λ − F5/2)
−λ2ǫ2[λ(1 ± ǫ) − F1/2] = 0.

(31)

First we take λ = F1/2 +∆1, where ∆1 is a small quantity
of the order ǫ. In the main order ∆1 ± ǫF1/2 = 0, and
this gives us the ﬁrst gap: F1/2(1 − ǫ) < λ < F1/2(1 + ǫ).
For the third gap we write λ = F3/2 + ∆3, where ∆3
is of order ǫ2. The equation for ∆3 with the third order
accuracy is

[(F3/2(1 ± ǫ) − F1/2)∆3 − ǫ2F 2

III. EXACT THEORY

In the exact nonlinear theory, the shape of the free
boundary is given in a parametric form by a com-
pound function z(ζ(u, t)), where z(ζ) is completely de-
termined by the bottom shape [for example, z(ζ) =
(ζ + i)2 − (b/h)2−i) corresponds to a vertical barrier
h(
of the size b at x = 0 at the straight horizontal bottom
with the depth y = −h]. The unknown function ζ(w, t)
should be analytical in the stripe −1 < Im w < 0 and
the combination [ζ(u − i, t) + i] should take real values.
These conditions relate the real and the imaginary parts
of ζ(u, t) at the real axis [32]:

Note that the previously considered operator [ˆk tanh ˆk]

where the (real) Lagrangian indeﬁnite multiplier Λ(u, t)
has been introduced in order to take into account the
analytical properties of the function ζ given by Eq.(37).
From the above Lagrangian one can obtain the equations
of motion. Variation of the action

gives the equation

plifying in the equation

Since the product ζu(1 + i ˆR)Λ has the same analytical
properties as both ζu and (1 + i ˆR)Λ, we can multiply
Eq.(43) by ζu and write

the above equation together with Eq.(41) result in

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

˜Λ = − ˆT [ψu ˆRψu].

Using this equality, we can reduce the real part of Eq.(44)
to the form

which is the Bernoulli equation in the conformal vari-
ables. Exact equations (42) and (46) [with given analyti-
cal function z(ζ) and with the condition (37)] completely
determine the evolution of gravitational surface waves
over the undulating bottom parameterized by a real pa-
rameter r as Xb(r) + iYb(r) = z(ζ)|ζ=r

i.

The very interesting point here is that one can re-write
equations (42) and (46) without the intermediate func-
tion ζ(u, t), but directly for z(u, t). Indeed, after multi-
plying Eq.(42) by z′(ζ) we obtain the equations

that is exactly the same system as was derived in [32]
for a straight horizontal bottom. However, in our case
analytical properties of the function z(w, t) are diﬀerent:

Im z(u) 6= ˆR[Re (z(u) − u)].

(49)

The only requirements for z(w, t) now are that it should
be analytical in the stripe −1 < Im w < 0 and the cor-
responding mapping should have a physical sense (no
self-intersections are allowed). The question may arise:
Where is the bottom shape in Eqs. (47)-(48)? The an-
swer is simple: The shape of the bottom is an integral of
motion for this system. Roughly speaking, each particu-
lar solution of Eqs.(47)-(48) corresponds to a ﬂow over a
deﬁnite topography determined by the initial condition
z(r − i, 0).

Equations (47)-(48) can be represented in another form
by using the identity 2 ˆT [ψu ˆRψu] = ψ2
u − ( ˆRψu)2 [32]
and introducing the complex potential Φ(u, t) = (1 +
i ˆR)ψ(u, t) which is analytically continued to the stripe
−1 < Im w < 0:

zt = −zu( ˆT + i)

For future numerical simulations, still another form of
the exact equations may be necessary, since numerical
stability depends dramatically on the choice of dynamical
variables [33, 34, 35, 36]. As was pointed in [33] for the
case of deep water (the same for horizontal bottom), a
good practical choice for the dynamical variables is A =
1/zu and B = Φu/zu. The equations of motion for A(u, t)
and B(u, t) are very elegant [33]:

At = −Au( ˆT + i)Im (B ¯A) + A( ˆT + i)∂uIm (B ¯A),

(52)

Bt = −Bu( ˆT +i)Im (B ¯A)−A(1+i ˆR)

Hopefully, these variables will allow stable numerical sim-
ulations for waves over varying seabed as they did for
waves on deep water [34, 35].

IV. SUMMARY

(47)

(48)

In this paper we have derived approximate weakly-
nonlinear, as well as exact nonlinear equations of motion
for potential water waves over a strongly inhomogeneous
bottom. The consideration was based on using the con-
formal mappings. For linear waves over periodic seabed,
the band structure of the spectrum has been calculated.
Though the obtained exact equations can be written
in formally the same form as those derived in [32] for a
straight horizontal bottom, but admissible solutions have
diﬀerent analytical properties if the bottom is inhomo-
geneous. If the equations are written in this form, the
bottom shape is preserved as an integral of motion.

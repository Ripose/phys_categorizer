We report an experimental evidence of a global bifurcation on a highly turbulent von K´arm´an ﬂow.
The mean ﬂow presents multiple solutions: the canonical symmetric solution becomes marginally
unstable towards a ﬂow which breaks the basic symmetry of the driving apparatus even at very
large Reynolds number. The global bifurcation between these states is highly subcritical and the
system thus keeps a memory of its history. The transition recalls low-dimension dynamical systems
transitions and exhibits a very peculiar statistics. We discuss the role of turbulence in two ways: the
multiplicity of hydrodynamical solutions and the eﬀect of ﬂuctuations on the nature of transitions.

PACS numbers: 05.45.-a, 47.20.-k, 47.27.Sd

Non-linear systems generally present multiple solutions
and various transitions between them. Moreover, stabil-
ity and transitions are inﬂuenced by the presence of noise
and/or ﬂuctuations. In the ﬁeld of turbulence, the ques-
tion of multistability of turbulent ﬂows, for example in
tornadoes [1, 2], delta wing ﬂow [3], wakes [4], and vortex
breakdown [5], remains open and unsolved. While mul-
tiple analytical or numerical solutions are often encoun-
tered for the Navier-Stokes equation at even moderate
Reynolds number (e.g., for swirling ﬂows [2, 5, 6, 7, 8]),
these solutions are generally neither experimentally rel-
evant, nor stable at very high Reynolds number. Fur-
thermore, turbulent ﬂows at very high Reynolds number
are generally expected to statistically respect the basic
symmetries of their driving apparatus. Indeed, even if
bifurcations and symmetry breaks occur on the way to
turbulence, the fully developed turbulent state is known
to restore the broken symmetries, in the limit of inﬁ-
nite Reynolds number and far from boundaries [9].
In
this Letter, we experimentally study the multistability
of a turbulent von K´arm´an ﬂow between two counter-
rotating disks in a ﬁnite vessel at very high Reynolds
number. This system undergoes a subcritical global bi-
furcation between turbulent states characterized by mean
ﬂows of diﬀerent topology and symmetry. These turbu-
lent states coexist at high Reynolds number and can be
“prepared” speciﬁcally, i.e., they keep a memory of the
system history. Since these states are highly ﬂuctuat-
ing turbulent states, we also address the question of the
role of the ﬂuctuations for such a transition. Actually,
the eﬀect of an external noise on an existing transition is
well documented [10], but the global bifurcation reported
here does only take place over an already ﬂuctuating tur-
bulent regime. Do ﬂuctuations trigger the bifurcation as
multiplicative noise do for nonlinear oscillators [11] and
turbulent α-eﬀect do for dynamo action [12] ?

Experimental setup. We call von K´arm´an type ﬂow
the ﬂow generated between two coaxial counter-rotating
impellers in a cylindrical vessel. The cylinder radius and
height are respectively R = 100 mm and Hc = 500 mm.

We use bladed disks to ensure inertial stirring. Most of
the inertially driven von K´arm´an setups studied in the
past dealt with straight blades [13, 14]. In this Letter,
the impellers consist of 185 mm diameter disks each ﬁtted
with 16 curved blades —curvature radius 50 mm, height
20 mm (Fig. 1). The distance between the inner faces of
the disks is H = 180 mm which deﬁnes a working space
for the ﬂow of aspect ratio H/R = 1.8. With curved
blades, the directions of rotation are no longer equivalent.
We rotate the impellers clockwise (with the concave face
of the blades). Four baﬄes (10 × 10 × 125 mm) can be
added along the cylinder wall.

The impellers are driven by two independent brush-
less 1.8 kW motors, with a speed servo loop control. The
motor rotation frequencies f1, f2 can be varied indepen-
dently in the range 0−15 Hz. An experiment is thus char-
acterized by two numbers: f = p(f 2
2 )/2 measuring
the intensity of the forcing and θ = (f2 − f1)/(f1 + f2)
measuring the speed dissymmetry (−1 ≤ θ ≤ 1). For ex-
act counter rotation f1 = f2 = f and θ = 0. The speed
servo loop control ensures a precision of 0.5% on f , and
an absolute precision of ±0.002 on θ for small values.

The working ﬂuid is water. Copper cooling coils be-
hind the impellers and a thermoregulated bath ensure
a thermal regulation with a precision of 1oC. Velocity
ﬁelds are measured by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV).
Torques are measured as an image of the current con-
sumption in the motors given by the servo drives and
have been calibrated by calorimetry. The analog signal
is low-pass ﬁltered at 10 Hz. For a typical frequency
f = 4 Hz at 35oC, the integral Reynolds number is
Re = 2πf R2ν−1 ≃ 3. 105 and the velocity ﬂuctuation

The von K´arm´an ﬂow phenomenology is the follow-
ing. Each impeller acts as a centrifugal pump: the ﬂuid
rotates with the impeller and is expelled radially.
It
is pumped in the center of the impeller.
In the exact
counter-rotating regime, the ﬂow is divided into two toric
cells separated by an azimuthal shear layer. The problem
(equation and boundary conditions) is invariant under ro-
tations of π (Rπ) around any radial axis passing through
the center of the cylinder. The velocity ﬁeld is expected
Rπ-invariant.

A “statistical” symmetry breaking.

In our high
Reynolds number regime, the ﬂow is highly turbulent.
For instance the rms value of the velocity is of the same
order of magnitude as the mean value. In Fig. 2 (left),
we present a map of the mean part of the exact counter-
rotation ﬂow measured by LDV. Two cells are observed,
the ﬂow is Rπ-invariant: the symmetries are statistically
restored [9]. The mean angular momentum of the ﬂuid is
equal to zero: the two impellers produce the same mean
torque to maintain the ﬂow. This situation is well-known
and documented. We label this symmetric state (s).

However, with our curved blades, we observe for small
θ a global bifurcation of the ﬂow after a certain time tbif :
both mean velocity ﬁeld and torques display dramatic
changes (Fig. 3). The two torques are suddenly 4 times
larger, and are no longer equal. The mean ﬂow exhibits

pumped toward impeller 1 without rotation. Then the
ﬂuid is expelled radially and starts spiraling along the
cylinder until it meets impeller 2 which rotates in the
opposite direction. It is abruptly stopped and reinjected
near the axis. We label this state (b1). A third state (b2)
is deduced from (b1) by exchanging the roles of impellers
1 and 2.
In bifurcated states (b1) or (b2), the ﬂuid is
globally in rotation: the mean angular momentum is not
zero.

Finally, three states are observed: the canonical Rπ-

cated states which break the Rπ symmetry at θ = 0, but
are images one of the other by Rπ. We detail in the next
section the transitions between these diﬀerent states.

Hysteresis loops. The diﬀerence between the two
torques characterizes the diﬀerent states. We have
checked that, as expected for so high a Reynolds num-
ber [9], the torque T given by one impeller for a given
(f, θ) does not depend on Re and scales as: T (f, θ) =
Kp(θ) ρR5 (2πf )2 [14], with ρ the ﬂuid density and Kp
a dimensionless power coeﬃcient.

In Fig. 4, we plot the dimensionless diﬀerence ∆Kp
between the two torques vs. θ for several conﬁgurations.
For straight blades, we observe a continuous curve from
θ = −1 to θ = 1 (Fig. 4a) with two transitions between
one- and two-cells ﬂows at θ = ±0.13. For impellers with
curved blades and no baﬄes on the cylinder wall, we ob-
serve the three states in Fig. 4b. For θ = 0, we recognize
state (s) (∆Kp = 0), and both bifurcated states (b1) and
(b2). State (s) branch is almost reduced to one point and
can only be reached by starting the two motors simul-
taneously. Its stability is discussed in the next section.
The bifurcated state (b1) lies on a branch coming contin-
uously from θ = −1 (f2 = 0). Starting from θ = −1 and
increasing θ, we stay on the (b1) branch even for θ > 0:
impeller 1 keeps rotating and pumping the ﬂuid although
its rotation rate is weaker than impeller 2 rotation rate.
For θ ≃ 0.16 there is a transition from (b1) to (b2): the
ﬂuid abruptly changes its sense of rotation. There is a
large hysteretic cycle. Note that it is impossible to reach
the symmetric state (s) by this way. The global quanti-
ties of this highly turbulent ﬂow keep memory of the way
the system has been started from rest. An intermedi-
ate situation is reached with the same curved blades and
baﬄes on the wall (Fig. 4c). Baﬄes break the spiraling
ﬂow along the wall of the cylinder, which is a major fea-
ture of the bifurcated state velocity ﬁeld. The hysteretic
cycle splits into two classical ﬁrst order cycles: the cen-
tral symmetric state becomes stable and can be obtained
from any initial condition.

Stability of the central branch (s). We focus now on
the transition from symmetric state to bifurcated state
for curved blades without baﬄes. As mentioned before,

the central branch is very small and, for a given (f, θ),
the transition occurs after a certain time tbif which ex-
hibits a complex statistics.

So we performed the following experiments: starting
from rest, we simultaneously start both motors to a given
(f, θ) with a short ramp (typically 1 s) and record the
torques. Few seconds after the instant tbif when bifur-
cation occurs, we stop the motors, wait a minute and
run again. We perform typically 500 runs to get the
distribution of bifurcation times. The cumulative dis-

tribution function (CDF) for tbif (Fig.

symmetric state a time greater than t: P (tbif > t) =
A exp[−(t − t0)/τ ], t0 is characteristic of the transition
duration (t0.f ∼ 5). Thus, we obtain a characteristic bi-
furcation time τ (f, θ) by non-linear ﬁtting of the CDF.
We performed the experiment for three values of f . The
results are shown in Fig. 6 in log-log scale. There is no
noticeable dependence on f and τ behaves as | θ |−6.
So, as θ tends to zero, τ diverges very fast to inﬁnity:
the central point is marginally stable. The physical phe-
nomenon at the origin of such an exponent remains to be
understood.

Discussion. The experiment presented here opens
mainly two problems: (i) the existence and the nature
of multiple regimes for this turbulent ﬂow, and (ii) the
role of the noise or the ﬂuctuations in some transitions
between these ﬂow regimes, i.e., the stability problem for
the two-cell (s) branch.

We ﬁrst try to explain the existence of multiple stable
regimes by hydrodynamical basic arguments. The von
K´arm´an (VK) class of Navier-Stokes solutions in semi-
inﬁnite space with one or two inﬁnite rotating disks for
end-conditions has been extensively studied since 1921
[6, 7, 15]. Experiments are necessarily limited in diame-
ter and do not strictly belong to the same class. However
the approximation is very commonly made at least for
small H/R. In practice, in our system, and in the spirit
of Batchelor [6] and Stewartson [7], we construct ﬁnite-
aspect-ratio solutions of our experimental VK problem at
high Re (Fig. 2) with (i) any typical truncated Batchelor
[6] solution for 0 ≤ r . R/2 together with (ii) some recir-
culation ﬂow in rotation in R/2 . r . R and (iii) a thin
boundary layer near the outer cylinder which matches
this rotation [16]. The two-cell mean ﬂow (s) is sim-
ply described in the laboratory frame by two rotating
regions inertially driven by the blades and separated by
a shear layer near mid-height. Both disks centrifugally
expel the ﬂuid. Let’s now consider one-cell ﬂows (b1) and
(b2). Since one disk expels the ﬂuid and the other rein-
jects it to the center, these ﬂows resemble the corotating
(f1.f2 < 0) regime solutions [6, 7] characterized by: uni-
form rotation of the bulk; a boundary layer on each disk;
pumping from one disk to the other and recirculation
at inﬁnity. This solution has no shear layer. Let’s note
that mean bulk rotation —for r . R/2— is close to zero
(Fig. 2, right). In conclusion, we can make the assump-
tion that ﬂows (b1) and (b2) are equivalent to corotating
ﬂows observed in two oppositely rotating frames of fre-
quencies +fr and −fr with |fr| > max(|f1|, |f2|). This
is well consistent with the fact that the single cell ﬂows
(b1) and (b2) exhibit global rotation in the outer shell
R/2 . r . R. The stability of such solution is clearly
enhanced by the concave curved blades that enforce ro-

tation of the ﬂuid near the outer cylinder.

Let’s now consider how these three solution branches
exchange their stability. First note that the bifurcation
diagrams respect the Rπ symmetry: θ → −θ; ∆Kp →
−∆Kp. The straight blades diagram (Fig. 4a) is con-
tinuous: from left to right two second order transitions
(b1)↔(s) and (s)↔(b2) are observed as in small H/R
systems [17]. On the contrary, the curved blades dia-
gram (Fig. 4b) is strongly hysteretic. Addition of baﬄes
(Fig. 4c) allows to remove a degeneracy: baﬄes drag dis-
turb the outer cylinder boundary layer ﬂow, thus lower-
ing the relative stability of one-cell ﬂows with respect to
the two-cell ﬂow. The large hysteresis cycle is split into
two classical ﬁrst-order bifurcations. This singular cycle
can thus be viewed as the result of the collapse or collision
of two ﬁrst-order cycles. Similar cycles are encountered
in conical [18] and delta-wing ﬂows [3]. The memory ef-
fect —if the system is currently on (s), both driving fre-
quencies must have been increased in parallel— is thus
essentially a consequence of the cycle structure.

In order to test the eﬀect of turbulence on the stabil-
ity of the observed ﬂows, we lowered Reynolds number
down to laminar using water/glycerol mixtures. While
Re . 1000, no multiplicity is observed:
the bifurca-
tion diagram is similar to the straight-blade diagram of
Fig. 4a. The cycle appears for Re between 1000 and 3000.
The study is in progress and will be reported elsewhere.
The high Reynolds behavior reported in this Letter is well
established once Re & 5000. Thus, multiplicity appears
with turbulence and does not with laminar (Re . 110)
nor chaotic (Re . 1000) ﬂows. A possible explanation
for the multiplicity could thus be the evolution of the
outer cylinder boundary layer with Re.

Besides, the statistical nature of the transitions them-
selves is probably related to turbulent ﬂuctuations. Let’s
ﬁrst notice that the bifurcation studied here corresponds
to exchange of stability between mean ﬂows, these mean
states being never realized at any given time. Is the bi-
furcation formalism exactly valid for our mean ﬂows ?
On some aspects, our system behaves as a low-dimension
dynamical system, as in the turbulent spiral transition
observed in wide-aspect-ratio Taylor-Couette ﬂow [19] or
in the noise-induced Hopf bifurcation for a Duﬃng os-
cillator with multiplicative white noise [11]. However,
suppose a non-linear amplitude equation could correctly
describe the shape bifurcation diagram, it would proba-
bly not be able to catch the statistics of the transition
from the two-cell state (s) to a one-cell state (b1) or (b2).
This transition shows a very peculiar statistics, with a
very high critical exponent 6 (Fig. 6).
It also strictly
respects a forbidden-transition rule: the horizontal axis
of the bifurcation diagram is never crossed, i.e., (s)→(b2)
[resp. (s)→(b1)] is forbidden for θ < 0 [resp. θ > 0]. This
observational fact could by itself justify the stability of
the central point θ = 0, which has to respect both rules.
Furthermore, the non-crossing of the axis could be the

4

signature of multiplicative noise as suggested to account
for small-scale turbulence [20].

The global bifurcation reported in this Letter presents
a very unusual bifurcation diagram. Some features about
the multistability have been searched among the mechan-
ics of high-Reynolds-number ﬂows, while some other sim-
ply involve the theory of non-linear bifurcations, possi-
bly in the presence of noise. Among the transitions, the
two-cell → one-cell stability exchange plays a remarkable
role, in presenting an original statistics of transition and
putting the ﬂow deﬁnitively in a state which breaks the
Rπ symmetry of the system and does not allow the ﬂow
to restore statistically this symmetry when Re → ∞.

sistance in building and piloting the experiment, and

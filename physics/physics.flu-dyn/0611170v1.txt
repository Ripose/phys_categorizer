Droplets are natural candidates for use as microﬂuidic reactors, if active control of their formation
and transport can be achieved. We show here that localized heating from a laser can block the motion
of a water-oil interface, acting as a microﬂuidic valve for two-phase ﬂows. A theoretical model is
developed to explain the forces acting on a drop due to thermocapillary ﬂow, predicting a scaling
law which favors miniaturization. Finally, we show how the laser forcing can be applied to sorting
drops, thus demonstrating how it may be integrated in complex droplet microﬂuidic systems.

taining one digital bit of information and the manipula-
tion of a large number of slightly diﬀering drops would
allow the testing of a large library of genes rapidly and
with a small total quantity of material [1]. In microchan-
nels, drops are produced and transported using a carrier
ﬂuid [2] and typical channel sizes allow the manipula-
tion of volumes in the picoliter range. Surfactant in the
carrier ﬂuid prevents cross-contamination of the drops
through wall contact or fusion [3, 4]. However, while the
geometry of the microchannel may be used to determine
the evolution of drops and their contents [3, 4, 5], the im-
plementation of real lab-on-a-chip devices hinges on the
active control of drop formation and its evolution, which
remains elusive.

In this letter, we remedy the situation by demonstrat-
ing experimentally how a focused laser can provide pre-
cise control over droplets through the generation of a
thermocapillary ﬂow. In doing so, we develop the ﬁrst
theoretical model of a droplet subjected to localized heat-
ing, yielding a general understanding of the forces acting
on the drop and a scaling law which favors miniaturiza-
tion. A carrier ﬂuid is still used for the formation and
transport of drops but the eﬀects of geometry are aug-
mented with a local thermal gradient produced by the
laser beam, focused through a microscope objective in-
side the microchannel.

Indeed, moving drops with heat has been a preoccupa-
tion of ﬂuid mechanicians since the initial work of Young
et al [6]. Although originally motivated by micrograv-
ity conditions where surface eﬀects are dominant [6, 7],
microﬂuidics has opened up a new area where bulk phe-
nomena are negligible compared to surface eﬀects. Re-
cently, thermal manipulation of drops or thin ﬁlms rest-
ing on a solid substrate has received the attention of the
microﬂuidics community either through the embedding
of electrodes in the solid [8, 9] or through optical tech-
niques [10, 11, 12]. However, the physical mechanisms
in the transmission of forces when the liquid touches a

solid wall are fundamentally diﬀerent from the case of
drops suspended in a carrier ﬂuid, away from the bound-
aries [13]. The latter case has received little attention de-
spite the advantages that microchannels oﬀer over open
geometries.

Our experimental setup consists of a microchannel fab-
ricated using soft lithography techniques [14]. Water and
oil (Hexadecane + 2% w/w Span 80, a surfactant) are
pumped into the channel at constant ﬂowrates, Qwater
and Qoil, using glass syringes and syringe pumps. Chan-
nel widths are in the range 100
500 µm and the height
50 µm. Local heating is produced

to a beam waist ω0 = 5.2 or 2.6 µm, respectively. The
optical approach can be reconﬁgured in real-time and it
allows the manipulation inside small microchannels with
no special micro-fabrication. The absorption of the laser
radiation by the aqueous phase is induced by adding 0.1%
w/w of ﬂuorescein in the water.

A surprising eﬀect is observed when the water-oil in-
terface reaches the laser spot: In the cross-shaped mi-
crochannel of Fig. 1, we produce water drops in oil
through the hydrodynamic focusing technique in which
two oil ﬂows pinch oﬀ water droplets at the intersection
of the channels. In the absence of the laser, drops of wa-
ter are produced in a steady fashion and are transported
along with the oil down the drain channel, as shown in
Figs. 1(a)-(c). When the laser is illuminated, however,
the oil-water interface is blocked in place as soon as it
crosses the beam. While the typical drop pinching time
100 ms in the absence of the laser, we ﬁnd that
is τd
we can block the interface for a time τb which may be of
several seconds, as shown in Figs. 1(d)-(f) (see support-
ing video 1). During the time τb, the drop shedding is
completely inhibited and the volume in the water tip in-
creases until the viscous stresses ﬁnally break it oﬀ. The
drop thus produced is larger, since it has been “inﬂated”
by the water ﬂow.

approximately linearly with the power, above an ini-

that the droplet length L varies linearly with τb, as ex-

The best linear ﬁt to the data gives an eﬀective water
ﬂowrate Qwater = 0.028 µL/min, close to the nominal
value 0.03 µL/min, showing that the water ﬂowrate re-
mains controlled even in presence of the laser forcing.
Thus, the optical forcing provides a tunable valve which
provides control over droplet timing and size. Similar
blocking is observed in a T geometry or if the ﬂows are
driven at constant pressure. However, the blocking is
only obtained when the light is absorbed, here by using
a dye.

We visualize the convection rolls produced by the heat-
ing by placing tracer particles in both ﬂuids, as shown in
Fig. 3(a) for a drop that is blocked in a straight channel.
For pure liquids, the direction of Marangoni ﬂow along
the interface is directed from the hot (low surface tension)
to the cold (high surface tension) regions. However, the
ﬂows in our experiments point towards the laser along the
interface, indicating an increase of surface tension with
temperature. This is consistent with previous studies
that have shown a linear increase of surface tension with
temperature in the presence of surfactants [15, 16, 17].

One important constraint for practical applications is
the amplitude of the temperature rise. Since the mate-
rials used in this study have similar thermal properties

The force generated by the convective ﬂow on a droplet
is investigated through the depth-averaged Stokes equa-
tions, since our channels have a large width/height aspect
ratio [19]. The detailed modeling will be discussed in a
subsequent publication; here we limit ourselves to the
main features: a circular drop of radius R is considered
in an inﬁnite domain and the ﬂow due to the Marangoni
stresses is evaluated. Assuming a parabolic proﬁle in the
small dimension (h) and introducing a streamfunction for
the mean velocities in the plane of the channel, the depth
averaged equations, valid in each ﬂuid, are

A typical predicted ﬂow ﬁeld solving the above nu-

four recirculation regions are clearly visible. The veloc-
ity gradients display a separation of scales in the normal

between the streamlines in the two directions. Indeed,
it may be veriﬁed that the velocities vary over a typi-
cal length scale h/R in the normal direction, while the
tangential length scale is given by w/R.

force is negative and therefore opposes the transport of
the drop by the external ﬂow. The y component vanishes
by symmetry and the integral of the wall friction may be
shown to be zero since the drop is stationary. Numeri-

The physical value of the force for a typical experiment
is estimated by taking µ1 = 10−3 Nm−2s (water), µ2 =
3µ1 (hexadecane), and extracting γ′
1 mNm−1K−1
from Ref. [16]. This yields a force on the order of 0.1 µN,
which is of the same order as the drag force on a drop
in a large aspect ratio channel [20], thus conﬁrming that
thermocapillary forcing can indeed account for the block-
ing. Note that the force we calculate is several orders of
magnitude larger those generated from electric ﬁelds [21]
or optical tweezers [22].

This blocking force may be applied at diﬀerent loca-
tions in a microchannel by displacing the laser spot. In
particular, we demonstrate the sorting of drops, a funda-
mental operation in the implementation of lab-on-a-chip
devices. Drops are formed, as above, in a cross-junction
and arrive at a symmetric bifurcation, carried by the
continuous phase.
In the absence of laser forcing, the
drops arriving at the bifurcation divide into two equal
parts [5], Fig. 4(a). When the laser is applied, the water-
oil interface is asymmetrically blocked on the right hand
side while the left hand side continues to ﬂow, Fig. 4(b).
Above a critical laser power (approximately 100 mW
for the present conﬁguration), the drop is blocked long
enough that it is completely diverted through the left
hand channel (see supporting video 2). Drops may there-
fore be sorted by accordingly selecting the laser position.
In summary, we have experimentally and theoretically

demonstrated the eﬃciency of laser-driven blocking of
water-in-oil drops. The theoretical treatment brings out
two length scales, h/R and w/R. While h and w can be
thought of as determining the typical scales for velocity
variations in the radial and azimuthal directions, R enters
the force scaling as a local radius of curvature rather than
the actual size of the drop. It is therefore not surprising
that the blocking force should increase as R decreases.
On the other hand, the drag force due to the external ﬂow
scales as R2 [20], implying that the laser power necessary
to counterbalance the drag quickly decreases with the
drop size. This, along with the rapidity of viscous and
thermal diﬀusion while thermal inertia is reduced, all lead

the process provides a practical new way for acting on
individual droplets, at any location, while working inside

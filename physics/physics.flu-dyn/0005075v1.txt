ABSTRACT

Starting from stationary bifurcations in Couette-Dean ﬂow, we compute nontrivial stationary solutions in in-
ertialess viscoelastic circular Couette ﬂow. These solutions are strongly localized vortex pairs, exist at arbitrarily
large wavelengths, and show hysteresis in the Weissenberg number, similar to experimentally observed “diwhirl”
patterns. Based on the computed velocity and stress ﬁelds, we elucidate a heuristic, fully nonlinear mechanism
for these ﬂows. We propose that these localized, fully nonlinear structures comprise fundamental building blocks
for complex spatiotemporal dynamics in the ﬂow of elastic liquids.

Flow computation.

Flow instabilities and nonlinear dynamics have long been recognized to occur in ﬂows of viscoelastic poly-
mer melts and solutions [1–3]. An important breakthrough, which has led to increasing recent attention to
these phenomena, was made by Larson, Shaqfeh and Muller [4], who discovered that circular Couette ﬂow of a
viscoelastic liquid undergoes an instability loosely analogous to the classical Taylor-Couette instability of New-
tonian liquids, but driven solely by elasticity - the instability is present at zero Taylor (Reynolds) number. They
also showed that a linear stability analysis of a simple ﬂuid model predicts instability and elucidated the basic
elasticity-driven mechanism of the instability. In particular, although many researchers had studied the eﬀects
of viscoelasticity on the Newtonian (inertial) Taylor-Couette instability, both experimentally [5–9], and theo-
retically [10,11,5–7,12], these workers were the ﬁrst to demonstrate an inertialess, purely elastic mechanism for
instability in a viscometric ﬂow. More recent observations have revealed a wealth of interesting dynamics in this
ﬂow as well as other simple ﬂows [3,13–15]; one set of experimental observations of particular interest was made
by Groisman and Steinberg [13], who found long-wavelength, stationary axisymmetric vortex pair structures in
inertialess viscoelastic ﬂow in the circular Couette geometry. There are two interesting aspects to these obser-
vations: (1) isothermal linear stability analysis in this geometry never predicts bifurcation of stationary states
(in contrast to the classical Taylor-Couette case) and (2) the observations suggest that these vortex pairs, which
Groisman and Steinberg dubbed “diwhirls”, can exist in isolation – there does not seem to be a selected axial
wavelength for this pattern. These considerations motivate the present computational study, which addresses
the following questions: (1) Do isolated branches of stationary solutions exist in a simple model of a viscoelastic
ﬂuid in the circular Couette geometry? (2) If so, what are the spatial structures of these? Are they localized?
(3) A nonlinear self-sustaining mechanism must be present for such patterns to exist. Can the computations
help us elucidate it?

We address these questions by fully nonlinear computations of the branching behavior of an inertialess isother-
mal FENE dumbbell ﬂuid in the circular Couette geometry.
Introduction of an azimuthal body force as an
additional parameter allows the possibility of accessing steady solution branches that would be isolated in the
parameter space of Couette ﬂow. We ﬁnd in short that the answers to all of the above questions is yes: isolated
solution branches consisting of spatially localized coherent structures have been computed for the ﬁrst time in a
purely elastic ﬂow, in very good agreement with the experimental observations, and a heuristic, fully nonlinear
mechanism has been elucidated.

We consider the ﬂow of an inertialess polymer solution in the annulus between two concentric cylinders. The
inner cylinder has radius R1 and the outer cylinder has radius R2. The ﬂow is assumed to periodic in the axial
direction, and we denote the period, nondimensionalized with the gap width R2 − R1, by L. The ﬂuid has a
relaxation time λ; the polymer and solvent contributions to the viscosity are denoted respectively by ηp and ηs,
with the ratio ηs/ηp denoted by S. The ﬂow is created by a combination of the motion of the inner cylinder at
a velocity ΩR1 and by the application of an azimuthal pressure gradient Kθ = ∂P/∂θ. The equations governing
the ﬂow are the momentum and mass conservation equations, and the FENE-P constitutive equation [16], which
models polymers as beads connected by ﬁnitely extensible springs. These may be written in dimensionless form
as

∇ · τ − ∇p + WeθS∇2

v = 0,

∇ · v = 0,

Weθ (cid:18) Dα

Dt − {α · ∇v}† − {α · ∇v}(cid:19) +(cid:18)

α

(1 − tr(α)/b) − I(cid:19) = 0,

where v is the velocity, p is the pressure, α is the ensemble average of the conformation tensor, and τ =

α/(1 − tr(α)/b) − I is the polymer stress tensor, with √b being a dimensionless measure of the maximum

extensibility of the dumbbells. The Weissenberg number, Weθ is the product of the polymer relaxation time
and a characteristic shear rate, which we take to be the shear rate at the outer cylinder for an Oldroyd-B
ﬂuid (1/b = 0) ﬂowing through the geometry. Other important parameters are the dimensionless gap width,
ǫ = (R2 − R1)/R2, and δ, which measures the relative importance of the pressure gradient as the driving force
for the ﬂow, given by

δ =

−Kθǫ2R2/(2 (ηp + ηs))

(1 − ǫ)R2Ω − Kθǫ2R2/(2 (ηp + ηs))

,

so that δ = 0 is circular Couette ﬂow and δ = 1 is Dean ﬂow (pressure driven ﬂow in a curved channel). The
velocity satisﬁes no slip boundary conditions on the walls of the cylinder. We compute steady, axisymmet-
ric solutions to the governing equations using a spectral element scheme [17] with Galerkin weighting on the
conservation equations and streamline-upwind/Petrov-Galerkin weighting [18,19] on the constitutive equations.
We use a branch switching technique to compute starting points on non-trivial branches, and pseudo-arclength
continuation to trace out solution curves in parameter space [20]. The linear systems in the Newton iteration
are solved using GMRES [21], with a modiﬁed dual threshold preconditioner [22,23].

We restrict our attention to parameters which are close to those used in the experiments by Groisman and
Steinberg [13]. Speciﬁcally, we choose parameter values S = 1.2, and ǫ = 0.2. The Reynolds numbers in their

experiments were <∼ 1, so our neglect of inertia corresponds well to their experiments. In our computations, we

ﬁnd that the most interesting behavior occurs only for large values of b, so for the results we present below, we
choose a value of 1830.

In the Couette ﬂow case (δ = 0), there is no bifurcation from the viscometric base state to a stationary
nontrivial state – if they exist, any branches of nontrivial stationary states in this case are isolated. So to
pursue such solutions, an indirect approach must be taken. We use the fact that in pure pressure-driven ﬂow
(δ = 1), stationary bifurcations do exist – by continuity these bifurcations also exist for δ < 1 and we search for
a route to the Couette case by exploring the evolution of these bifurcating branches. Speciﬁcally, we traced out
a stationary branch originating at δ = 0.576, L = 2.71, Weθ = 25.15, then increased L to 3.08 while holding the
values of the other parameters ﬁxed, then reduced δ downward, ﬁnding that this solution branch persisted at
δ = 0. We have thereby shown that there is indeed an isolated branch of nontrivial stationary patterns in the
circular Couette ﬂow geometry. If we now decrease L, we ﬁnd a turning point at L = 2.94, so these solutions do
not exist for wavelengths shorter than this. On the other hand, when we increase L, we ﬁnd that the solutions
exist at arbitrarily large wavelength. Figure 1 shows the contours of the streamfunction and αθθ at L = 110.89
( i.e., the axial wavelength is more than 100 times times the gap width!) The core of the pattern (which has

2

been magniﬁed for clarity) is a region of very strong inﬂow, surrounded by regions of much weaker outﬂow. The
αθθ ﬁeld shows an even more intense localization at the core and requires the use of a very ﬁne spectral element
mesh to resolve. The strong localization at the core and the asymmetry between inﬂow and outﬂow are features
shared by the experimentally observed diwhirls [13], which indicates that we are capturing the physics behind
the structures they observe. Away from the core, the ﬂow ﬁeld is almost pure circular Couette ﬂow. In obtaining
solutions at very large values of L, we exploited the lack of axial variation away from the center and the fact
that the characteristic length of the localization near the core does not change at large wavelengths by using
the same mesh as at smaller values of L close to the center, and simply increasing the lengths of the spectral
elements bordering the axial edges.

Figure 2 shows the results of continuation in Weθ for three diﬀerent values of L. In each case, we see a turning
point in Weθ. It is located at Weθ = 24.97 for L = 3.08, at Weθ = 23.37 for L = 4.72, and at Weθ = 23.55
for L = 9.11. The point at which the diwhirls lose existence is much lower than the critical Weθ for linear
instability at that wavelength, so that the overall bifurcation structure shows a hysteretic character, consistent
with experiment.

A natural question regarding these new ﬂow states is their stability. We have performed linear stability
analyses with respect to axisymmetric perturbations, for selected parameter values. These results will be detailed
elsewhere [23], but the main result is simple and interesting: there is an unstable complex conjugate pair of
eigenvalues, corresponding to instability with respect to oscillatory disturbances. The destabilizing disturbance,
however, has signiﬁcant amplitude only near the ends of the domain, where the ﬂow is essentially Couette ﬂow
(which is linearly unstable at the parameter values chosen) and vanishes in the core region of the diwhirl. So the
picture that emerges is this: the diwhirl pattern is robust, and it coexists with, but is spatially distinct from,
the oscillatory ﬁnite wavelength pattern arising from the linear instability.

By estimating the work done by a ﬂuid element in a single ﬂow cycle (as seen in a Lagrangian reference
frame), Groisman and Steinberg [24] argued that long wavelength stationary structures which exhibited signiﬁcant
asymmetry between inﬂow and outﬂow were possible in Couette ﬂow. While this argument shows that diwhirl
structures are physically plausible, it does not explain the mechanism by which they are sustained. Having the
complete velocity and stress ﬁeld available to us, we propose a more complete mechanism. Figure 3 shows a vector
plot of v near the outer cylinder at the center of the diwhirl structure. We see that the vθ ﬁeld at the diwhirl
center is locally parabolic near the outer cylinder, similar to the velocity ﬁeld in the upper half of the channel in
Dean ﬂow, which displays a stationary vortex instability due to the corresponding unstable stratiﬁcation of the
azimuthal normal stress [25]. We therefore propose the following mechanism for the instability: a local, ﬁnite
amplitude perturbation near the outer cylinder creates a locally parabolic velocity proﬁle. This velocity proﬁle
results in an unstable stratiﬁcation of hoop stress, just as in Dean ﬂow, which drives inward radial motion. The
ﬂuid accelerates azimuthally as it moves radially inward, due to the base state velocity gradient, thus maintaining
the increase in vθ, resulting in a self-sustaining process (ﬁgure 4).

To summarize, we have computed stationary nontrivial solutions in circular Couette ﬂow using a FENE-P
model by numerical continuation from stationary bifurcations in Couette-Dean ﬂow. These solutions show very
strong localization, exist only for large values of b and large wavelengths, and show a hysteretic character in Weθ.
The self-sustaining mechanism is related to the mechanism of instability in viscoelastic Dean ﬂow, and arises
from a ﬁnite amplitude perturbation giving rise to a locally parabolic proﬁle of the azimuthal velocity near the
upper wall. The computed ﬂow structures are very similar to the experimentally observed diwhirl patterns [13].
Along with the solutions arising from the linear instability of the circular Couette ﬂow base state, we propose
that these solutions form building blocks for spatiotemporal dynamics in the ﬂow of elastic liquids.

these parameter regimes, ﬂuid inertia plays a signiﬁcant role. Thus, the patterns they simulate cannot be classiﬁed
as being driven by elasticity alone.

Abstract. In the framework of the canonical model of hy-
drodynamics, where ﬂuid is assumed to be ideal and incom-
pressible, waves are potential, two-dimensional, and sym-
metric, the authors have recently reported the existence of a
new type of gravity waves on deep water besides well studied
Stokes waves (Lukomsky et al., 2002b). The distinctive fea-
ture of these waves is that horizontal water velocities in the
wave crests exceed the speed of the crests themselves. Such
waves were found to describe irregular ﬂows with stagnation
point inside the ﬂow domain and discontinuous streamlines
near the wave crests. Irregular ﬂows produce a simple model
for describing the initial stage of the formation of spilling
breakers when a localized jet is formed at the crest following
by generating whitecaps.

In the present work, a new highly efﬁcient method for
computing steady potential gravity waves on deep water

Introduction

From old times the wave motion of the ocean bewitched and
extremely attracted the attention of mankind. Up to now the
problem of understanding speciﬁc features of water waves

and their modelling represent a real challenge both from sci-
entiﬁc and engineering points of view. Occurrence of ex-
tremely large and steep ocean breaking waves imposes a haz-
ard to ﬁshing boats, ships, and off-shore oil facilities. To
understand physical mechanisms that give rise to extreme
breaking waves and to model them correctly it is necessary to
gain detailed knowledge of the form and dynamics of steep
water waves.

The canonical problem about the propagation of surface
waves on deep water (see Section 2) was the ﬁrst essentially

almost two hundred years gave the origin to many ﬁelds of
non-linear dynamics such as solitary waves, modulation in-
stabilities, strange attractors, etc. Stokes (1847) was the ﬁrst
who considered surface waves of ﬁnite amplitude (Stokes
waves). Stokes (1880) conjectured that such waves must
have a maximal amplitude (the limiting wave) and showed
the ﬂow in this wave to be singular at the crest forming a 120◦
corner (the Stokes corner ﬂow). Much later, Grant (1973)
suggested that this singularity, for a wave that has not at-
tained the limiting form, is located above the wave crest and
forms a stagnation point with streamlines meeting at right
angles. Longuet-Higgins and Fox (1978) proved this numer-
ically after extending Stokes ﬂows analytically outside the
domain ﬁlled by ﬂuid. The following question resulted: why
the ﬂow in the limiting Stokes wave has the 120◦ singularity
instead of the 90◦ one, as in any wave with lesser ampli-
tude? Because of this Grant (1973) conjectured that a con-
tinuous approach to the limiting amplitude is possible only
if the Stokes corner ﬂow has several coalescing singularities.
However, it has not yet clear where these multiple singulari-
ties arise from.

A new era in developing the theory of steep gravity waves
started from the work of Longuet-Higgins (1975), where he
found that many characteristics of gravity waves, such as
speed, energy, and momentum, are not monotonic functions
of the wave amplitude, as was assumed from Stokes, but at-
tain total maxima and then drop before the limiting wave
is reached. Longuet-Higgins and Fox (1977) constructed

asymptotic expansions for waves close to the 120◦-cusped
wave (almost highest waves) and showed that these depen-
dences oscillate inﬁnitely as the limiting wave is approached.
Nevertheless, strict numerical veriﬁcation of such oscilla-
tions seems to be a real challenge up to the present time,
with only the ﬁrst relative maximum and minimum having
been thoroughly investigated (see, e.g., Longuet-Higgins and
Tanaka, 1997).

Tanaka (1983) showed that gravity waves steeper than the
wave with maximal total energy become unstable with re-
spect to two-dimensional disturbances having the same pe-
riod as an undisturbed wave (superharmonic instability). Jil-
lians (1989) investigated the form of such instabilities and
showed that they lead to wave overturning and breaking.
The conjecture was made that wave breaking is a purely lo-
cal phenomenon around the wave crest which, in the case
of spilling breakers and more gently plunging breakers, oc-
curs independently of the ﬂow in the rest of a wave. Pro-
ceeding with this idea Longuet-Higgins and Cleaver (1994)
and Longuet-Higgins et al. (1994) suggested that superhar-
monic instability results in the crests of almost highest Stokes
waves to be unstable (crest instability). Longuet-Higgins and
Tanaka (1997) strongly supported the conclusion that super-
harmonic instabilities of Stokes waves are indeed crest insta-
bilities. Finally, Longuet-Higgins and Dommermuth (1997)
showed that crest instabilities lead (i) to wave overturning
and breaking or (ii) to a smooth transition of a wave to a
lower progressive wave having nearly the same total energy,
followed by a return to a wave of almost the initial wave
height. The latter fact generated a new question: what is the
nature of such a transient phenomenon? A possible explana-
tion would be found if superharmonic instability resulted in
a bifurcation to a new solution, as usually takes place in non-
linear dynamics. However, up to this time it was assumed
that the Stokes solution is unique and free of bifurcations in
keeping with the uniqueness argument of Garabedian (1965).
The only bifurcation known to occur is the trivial one of a
pure phase shift at the point of energy maximum (Tanaka,
1985).

The above results are all related to Stokes waves, for which
the speed of ﬂuid particles at the wave crests is smaller than
the wave phase speed, equality being achieved for the limit-
ing wave only. Thus, the traditional criterion for wave break-
ing is that horizontal water velocities in the crest must ex-
ceed the speed of the crest (Banner and Peregrine, 1993).
Lukomsky et al. (2002a,b) have recently provided evidence
(although numerical and not completely rigorous) for the ex-
istence of a new family of two-dimensional irrotational sym-
metric periodic gravity waves that satisfy the criterion of
breaking. A stagnation point in the ﬂow ﬁeld of these waves
is inside the ﬂow domain, in contrast to the Stokes waves of
the same wavelength. This makes streamlines exhibit discon-
tinuity in the vicinity of the wave crests, with near-surface
particles being jetted out from the ﬂow. Because of this such
waves and ﬂows were called irregular (in contrast to regu-
lar Stokes ﬂows). Existence of irregular waves made the au-
thors propose the following conjectures (see Lukomsky et al.,

2002b): (i) a 120◦ corner at the crest of the limiting Stokes
wave seems to be formed by merging the stagnation points
of a regular Stokes ﬂow and an irregular ﬂow; (ii) irregular
ﬂows are apparently the result of developing superharmonic
or crest instabilities of regular Stokes ﬂows.

To calculate irregular ﬂows Lukomsky et al. (2002a,b)
used truncated Fourier expansions for the velocity poten-
tial and the elevation of a free surface in the plane of
spatial variables (a physical plane). Debiane and Kharif
(see Gandzha et al., 2002) conﬁrmed the existence of ir-
regular waves using inverse plane Longuet-Higgins method
(Longuet-Higgins, 1986), where the spatial coordinates are
represented as Fourier series in velocity potential and stream
function, the corresponding coefﬁcients being evaluated by
solving quadratic relations between them. Finally, Clam-
ond (2003) also obtained irregular ﬂows by applying his new
renormalized cnoidal wave (RCW) approximation. Note,
however, that at present these are only numerical and approx-
imate proofs.

Ordinary Fourier expansions used by Lukomsky et al.
(2002a) become not efﬁcient enough for approximating ir-
regular waves and even Stokes waves close to the limiting
one due to slow descending of the Fourier coefﬁcients. Thus,
a more efﬁcient method is necessary for these tasks. Up
to now the most precise and efﬁcient way for calculating
the properties of two-dimensional surface waves is Tanaka’s
method of the inverse plane (see Tanaka, 1983, 1986). The
key idea of his method is to map the inverse plane into a
unit circle by means of the Nekrasov transformation. Then
boundary conditions are transformed to an integral equation,
which is solved iteratively. The accuracy of obtained solu-
tions is drastically improved by concentrating a numerical
emphasis on the crest region using further transformation of
variables. As a result, Tanaka’s method is the only one be-
ing capable of evaluating the second maximum of the phase
speed and even further higher order extremums.
In spite
of all the advantages of Tanaka’s method and his program,
where it is implemented, we are interested in improving the
methods of the physical plane since they can be applied for
calculating 3D waves as well and can be generalized to the
case of non-ideal and compressible ﬂuid, in contrast to all the
inverse plane methods.

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to present a new method
in the physical plane for calculating two-dimensional poten-
tial steady progressive surface waves on the ﬂuid of inﬁnite
depth (see Section 3). The method is based on the fractional
Fourier approximation for the velocity potential recently in-
troduced by the authors (Gandzha et al., 2002; Lukomsky
et al., 2002c) and the non-linear transformation of the hori-
zontal scale for concentrating a numerical emphasis near the
wave crest. The ﬁrst term of such a fractional Fourier ap-
proximation was independently derived by Clamond (2003)
and was called a renormalized cnoidal wave approximation.
In Section 4, fractional Fourier approximations are applied
for calculating regular and irregular ﬂows. In Section 4.1,
great numerical advantage of fractional approximations over
ordinary Fourier approximations is demonstrated when cal-

culating almost highest Stokes waves. Although the accu-
racy of the results is still less than the ones obtained us-
ing Tanaka’s method, proposed fractional Fourier approxi-
mations have a potential to become almost as effective as
the method of Tanaka. In Section 4.2, fractional approxima-
tions allowed investigating the character of singularity of ir-
regular ﬂows in more detail. The proﬁles of irregular waves
are shown to reveal the Gibbs phenomenon usually taking
place when a discontinuous function or a continuous function
with discontinuous derivatives are approximated by continu-
ous truncated Fourier series. Moreover, even regular Stokes
waves very close to the Stokes corner ﬂow are also demon-
strated to exhibit the similar Gibbs phenomenon in accor-
dance with the observation of Chandler and Graham (1993).
Concluding remarks are given in Section 5.

2 The canonical model

Consider the dynamics of potential two-dimensional periodic
waves on the irrotational, inviscid, incompressible ﬂuid with
unknown free surface under the inﬂuence of gravity. Waves
are assumed to propagate without changing their form from
left to right along the x-axis with constant speed c relative
to the motionless ﬂuid at inﬁnite depth (see Fig. 1). Gravity
waves and related ﬂuid ﬂows are governed by the following
set of equations

ct is the wave phase, Φ(θ, y) is the velocity
where θ = x
potential (the velocity is equal to −→
Φ), η(θ) is the elevation
∇
of the unknown free surface, and y is the upward vertical
axis such that y = 0 is the still water level. Herein (1) is the
Laplace equation in the ﬂow domain, (2) is the dynamical
boundary condition (the Bernoulli equation), (3) is the kine-
matic boundary condition (no ﬂuid crosses the surface), (4)
is the condition that ﬂuid is motionless at inﬁnite depth. The
dimensionless variables are chosen such that length and time
are normalized by the wavenumber k and the frequency √gk
of a linear wave, respectively, g being the acceleration due to
gravity. In this case, the dimensionless wavelength λ = 2π.

Once the velocity potential and the wave phase speed are
known, particle trajectories (streamlines) are found from the
following differential equations:

in the frame of reference moving together with the wave

erence, each streamline is characterized by a constant value

stream function Ψ(θ, y) = ψ(θ, y) + cy in the laboratory
frame of reference are connected by means of the Cauchy-
Riemann conditions:

In addition to the Laplace equation and the boundary con-
ditions, an initial condition should be assigned. Since the
canonical model is energy conservative, the wave total en-
ergy can be used instead to characterise wave properties. For
this purpose, however, the crest-to-trough height H or the
wave steepness A = H/λ are the more convenient param-
eters since they monotonously increase starting from linear
waves up to the limiting conﬁguration. Thus, using the Eqs.
(1), (8), (9), (4) of the canonical model the following quanti-
ties are to be found as the functions of the wave steepness A:
the complex function R(θ, y), the elevation η(θ) of the free
surface, and the wave phase speed c.

3 The method for obtaining solutions

3.1 Fractional Fourier approximations

When working in the plane of spatial variables the solutions
to the Laplace equation (1) in the ﬂow domain are usually
looked for as the following truncated Fourier series

This approach was applied by the authors (Lukomsky et al.,
2002a,b) for calculating steep gravity waves. Fourier ex-
pansions (10), however, become ineffective for steep waves
with sharpening crests close to the limiting wave due to slow
descending of the Fourier coefﬁcients. Because of this we
proposed (Gandzha et al., 2002; Lukomsky et al., 2002c) a
more effective set of functions to expand the velocity poten-
tial on the basis of the following Euler formula (see Ham-
ming, 1962)

of expansion (12), which he called a renormalized cnoidal
wave (RCW) approximation. There may be other possibili-
ties to improve ordinary Fourier expansion (10) besides the
proposed fractional expansion (12). However, one should ad-
ditionally assure the convergence of series that makes con-
structing such generalized expansions much more difﬁcult.

which follows directly from (12), that the boundary condition

Hereafter, only the symmetric waves are considered. In
this case, the coefﬁcients αn and ξn are real (in general, they
are complex numbers for nonsymmetric waves). After taking
into account expansions (12) and (14) the boundary condi-

expansion (12) a “fractional Fourier expansion”. It is sin-
gular in a countable number of isolated points y = y0,
Z, their location being determined by a free

ﬂow domain for calculating potential waves. At y0 =

expansion (10) with ξn = (

sions (10) and (12) are equivalent at N =
vergence of (12) follows from the convergence of (10). For
1, however, a fractional Fourier expansion
ﬁnite N and y0 ∼
converges much more rapidly than an ordinary Fourier ex-
pansion. The reason is that a ﬁnite number of terms in (12)
always corresponds to an inﬁnite number of terms in (10) that
is especially important for sharp-crested waves.

Expansions (12), (10), and,

in general, any function
R(θ, y) = R(y + iθ) all satisfy the Laplace equation (1)
exactly. The latter fact was also used by Clamond (1999,
2003) (for ﬁnite and inﬁnite depth, respectively) to introduce
a renormalization principle that allows reconstructing the ve-
locity potential in the whole domain once the velocity po-
tential at the bottom (or any other level) is known. By ap-
plying such renormalization to the ﬁrst-order periodic solu-
tion of KdV equation Clamond (2003) obtained the velocity

3.2 Nonlinear transformation of the horizontal scale

To solve boundary conditions (15) and (16) one should assign
an appropriate approximation to the unknown elevation y =
η(θ) of the free surface. In the plain of spatial variables, the
Fourier series

are often used. Taking inﬁnite bounds is not necessary for
proﬁles with rounded enough crests. However, adequate de-
scription of sharp-crested proﬁles close to the limiting one re-
quires taking into account excessively large number of modes
due to extremely slow descending of the Fourier coefﬁcients.
This highly restricts practical application of (17). The fol-
lowing non-linear transformation of the horizontal scale orig-
inally suggested by Chen and Saffman (1980)

θ(χ; γ) = χ

γ sin χ, 0 < γ < 1,

(18)

allows overcoming this difﬁculty by stretching sharp crests to
a more rounded conﬁguration. As a result, the Fourier series

(Lukomsky et al., 2002c). Due to nonlinear transformation

η(0)
corresponds to inﬁnite number of the coefﬁcients ηn ≡

being presented in Appendix A. Thus, the role of the pa-
rameter γ for the series (17) in horizontal coordinate θ is the
same to the role of the parameter y0 for the series (10) in
vertical coordinate y.

The truncation of Eqs. (20), (21) was chosen for the fol-

found in terms of the harmonics η(γ)

properties may be missed when using it as a governing pa-

the elevation in the θ-space (a spectral characteristic) as an
independent variable instead of the wave steepness. In this

The set of Eqs. (20), (21) was solved by Newton’s method,
the Jacoby matrix being given in Appendix B. Starting values
for new calculations were taken from previous runs. For large
enough N and M , the Jacoby matrix was found to become
badly conditioned. Because of this the program realization
was implemented in arbitrary precision computer arithmetic.
For instance, computations at N = 150, M = 2.5N demand
160-digit arithmetic that is ten times more accurate than the
machine one. Note that such a run is equivalent in computer
time to a run with N = 250, M = 4N using ordinary Fourier
approximations and because of this takes approximately 4
times lesser computer memory.

The truncation numbers N and M are chosen for the fol-
lowing reasons. By ﬁxing the number N in expansion (12)
an approximate conﬁguration of the velocity potential is as-
signed. To ﬁnd out a proper truncation of the series (19)
for the elevation associated with this conﬁguration, the num-
ber M should be increased until the revision of solutions for
greater M becomes less than chosen accuracy. Then the pre-
cision to which boundary conditions (9) and (8) are satisﬁed
deﬁnes the absolute errors connected with a truncation of the
potential and elevation, respectively. The overall relative er-
ror Ermax of such an approximate solution is agreed to be the
maximal absolute error in boundary conditions (8) and (9) all
over the wave period divided by the Bernoulli constant B. To
obtain a solution close to the exact one, one should gradually
increase the number N , choosing every time a proper value
of M , until overall desired precision is achieved. In a major-
ity of calculations, it was sufﬁcient to use the approximation
M = 2.5N or lesser ones.

The numerical scheme proposed operates with two param-

accelerates the convergence of the fractional Fourier expan-

to retain the same accuracy.
Increasing γ from γ = 0 to
0 accelerates the convergence of the expan-

sion (19) for the elevation, lesser M being necessary to retain
the same accuracy. These two processes, however, should
be carried out simultaneously. Using the fractional Fourier
expansion (12) without the transformation of the horizontal
scale (18) was found to deteriorate the convergence of series
(17) and, vice versa, using the transformation of the horizon-
tal scale without the fractional Fourier expansion was found
to deteriorate the convergence of expansion (10), with only
slight overall beneﬁt having been achieved. On the contrary,
using the fractional Fourier expansion in combination with
the nonlinear transformation of the horizontal scale proved

3.4 Physical quantities

Once the coefﬁcients αn, η(γ)
n and the wave phase speed c are
found, a variety of wave characteristics can be calculated.
The velocity potential, stream function, and the horizontal
and vertical velocities of ﬂuid particles are as follows:

The Stokes ﬂow K, the wave impulse I, and the wave ki-

netic energy EKin are as follows (see Cokelet (1977)):

K = B + η0, I = Kc, EKin = cI/2;

(32)

where η0 = η(θ) is the wave mean level and is determined
from relation (A1).

(28)

4.1 Stokes waves

The dependence c(A) of the phase speed of almost highest
Stokes waves on their steepness calculated using fractional
Fourier approximations is shown in Fig. 2 by the branch 1-2-
3-6. And the corresponding dependence c(η1) of the phase
speed on the ﬁrst harmonic of the elevation is presented in
Fig. 3 by the branch 1-2-3-4-6. The corresponding points
of extremums in phase speed c, the ﬁrst harmonic η1, and
steepness A are presented in Table 1.

The advantage of fractional Fourier approximations over
ordinary Fourier approximations is well seen from Table 2.
There, the values of the wave phase speed c and the mean
water level η0 calculated using these two approaches are pre-
sented at different values of the wave steepness A up to the
limiting one. The precise value of the mean level η0 should
be zero for inﬁnite depth independently of steepness. There-
fore, the approximate values of η0 can be used to estimate the

precision of approximate results. The maximal relative er-
rors Ermax of corresponding approximate solutions are also
presented for analysis. One can see from the relative errors
that the beneﬁt from using fractional Fourier approximations
with parameters chosen varies from ten decimal orders for
A = 0.14 (
99.25% of the limiting steepness) to one deci-
mal order for A = 0.141064 (almost the limiting steepness).
After taking into account that a run using fractional Fourier
approximations with N = 120, M = 2.5N needs approx-
imately 2.5 times lesser computer time and approximately
10 times lesser computer memory than a run using ordinary
Fourier approximations with N = 250, M = 4N , the ad-
vantage of fractional approximations becomes doubtless.

≈

Nevertheless, the results presented for the values of steep-
ness beyond the ﬁrst minimum of c (A = 0.14092) are still
less accurate than the ones obtained from Tanaka’s program,
which are also included into Table 2 for comparison. This
is also well seen from Fig. 2, where the second maximum
of c (A = 0.141056, the point 5) was obtained only using
Tanaka’s program. The fractional Fourier approximation at
y0 = 0.9 is sufﬁcient to obtain the second maximum of η1
(the point 4 in Fig. 3), but not sufﬁcient to trace the second
maximum of c. The reason is that the value y0 = 0.9 used is
optimal for the steepness corresponding to the ﬁrst minimum
of c, yet lesser y0 being necessary for greater A to improve
the precision of fractional Fourier approximations. However,
using the present computer realization of the method the au-
thors failed to accomplish this task due to unsatisfactory con-
vergence of their numerical algorithm for y0 < 0.9. If this
problem could be resolved fractional Fourier approximations
in the physical plane would have a potential to become al-
most as effective as Tanaka’s method in the inverse plane.

4.2 Irregular ﬂows

The ﬂow ﬁeld in Stokes waves is regular, that is, ﬂuid par-
ticles move slower than the wave itself all over the ﬂow do-
In the Stokes corner ﬂow only, the ﬂuid particle at
main.
the wave crest moves with velocity equal to the wave phase
speed and, therefore, is motionless with respect to the wave.
Because of this such points in the ﬂow ﬁeld are called the
stagnation points. For all the Stokes waves other than the
limiting one, a stagnation point is located outside the ﬂow
domain, as was at ﬁrst shown by Grant (1973). The example
of such a regular ﬂow mapped outside the domain ﬁlled by
ﬂuid is presented in Fig. 4. The streamlines at the stagnation
point O meet at right angles in accordance with the results of
Grant (1973) and Longuet-Higgins and Fox (1978).

Lukomsky et al. (2002b) have numerically revealed an-
other type of waves with stagnation point located inside the
ﬂow domain. This stagnation point makes streamlines be dis-
continuous in the vicinity of the wave crest and form two
symmetric upward and downward jets. Because of this such
waves and ﬂows were called irregular. The example of such
an irregular ﬂow calculated using fractional Fourier approx-
imations is shown in Fig. 5. Note that the streamlines at the
stagnation point O1 also meet at right angles. This is the gen-

eral rule valid for all the irregular and regular ﬂows provided
that the stagnation point and the wave crest do not merge (see
Appendix C for details).

One can see from Fig. 5 that the particles from the near-
surface layer of the irregular ﬂow are accelerated to veloci-
ties greater than the wave phase speed when approaching the
crest. As a result, they form the upward jet emanating from
the front face of the wave. The acceleration of particles at
the base of the jet ranges from 2.5g at θ = 0.001 to 6g at
the wave crest. Such large accelerations of the water rising
up the front of the wave into the jet are known to occur in
breaking waves (see Banner and Peregrine, 1993), where the
typical maxima in accelerations obtained from detailed un-
steady numerical computations were reported to be around
5g. In view of these points, irregular ﬂows produce a sim-
pliﬁed model for describing the initial stage of wave break-
ing or, to be more precise, the formation of spilling breakers
when a localized jet is formed near the crest following by
generating whitecaps.

Irregular wave is an approximate stationary and obviously
unstable solution to the equations of motion. Although we
did not investigate its unsteady evolution, the following re-
sults are expected. The particles with velocities greater than
the wave speed will all be jetted out away from the ﬂuid
and the crest will break if their is no external inﬂux into
the ﬂow domain from the left downward jet. After ﬁnish-
ing this non-stationary process the ﬂow will become regular
and of lesser steepness. This resembles the recurrence phe-
nomenon observed by Longuet-Higgins and Dommermuth
(1997) when computing unsteady non-linear development of
the crest instabilities of almost highest Stokes waves result-
ing in a smooth transition to a periodic wave of lower ampli-
tude. The appearance of irregular ﬂows may give an expla-
nation to this phenomenon.

Irregular ﬂows at ﬁxed truncation numbers N and M de-
pend on the wave steepness A in the following way. As
wave steepness decreases from the limiting value, the stagna-
tion point settles down deeper into the ﬂow domain and the
distance between the upward and downward jets increases.
The corresponding dependence of the phase speed of irregu-
lar waves on their steepness c(A) is shown in Fig. 2 by the
branch 6-8. And the dependence c(η1) of the phase speed on
the ﬁrst harmonic of the elevation is presented in Fig. 3 by the
branch 6-7-8. While moving along the irregular branch away
from the limiting point 6 the accuracy of approximate solu-
tions at ﬁxed N and M drops. Because of this the branches
corresponding to irregular ﬂows in Figs. 2, 3 have not yet
stabilized with respect to increasing the truncation numbers
N and M , although fractional approximations (12) in com-
bination with non-linear transformation (18) are up to one
decimal order more accurate than ordinary Fourier approx-
imations (10) when calculating irregular waves. The loop
in Fig. 2 still enlarges with increasing N , the cross-section
point with the Stokes branch moving to the left. On the
contrary, the irregular branch 6-7-8 in the dependence c(η1)
(see Fig. 3) approaches to the regular branch 1-2-3-4-6 as
accuracy is increased. They seem to coincide completely at

. This may explain why irregular waves were not
N
traced from stability analysis of Stokes waves. Similar to
almost limiting Stokes waves, lesser y0 are necessary to im-
prove the precision of fractional Fourier approximations and
to stabilize the position of the irregular branch.

Thus, our main concern is that irregular ﬂow is an ap-
proximate solution, whose accuracy is not sufﬁcient enough
to make deﬁnite conclusions even when using fractional ap-
proximations. The only reasonable assumption is that irreg-
ular waves correspond to singular solutions of the equations
of motion. One can see from Fig. 5 that although streamlines
of the irregular ﬂow are discontinuous near the wave crest
the wave proﬁle η(θ) remains to be a continuous function
everywhere. This is due to the Fourier series (19) for η(θ)
being a single-valued smooth function, which represents an
integral characteristic of the ﬂow. On the contrary, the stream
function Ψ(θ, y) represents a local characteristic of the ﬂow
and is not obligatory a single-valued dependence. Because
of this streamlines describe the discontinuous ﬂow near the
wave crest more adequately. It is seen from Fig. 5 that the
proﬁle of the irregular ﬂow oscillates while approaching the
wave crest, where a prominent peak (an overshoot) forms.
This highly resembles the Gibbs phenomenon when (i) a dis-
continuous function or (ii) a continuous function with dis-
continuous derivatives are approximated by a truncated set
of continuous functions (see, e.g., Arfken and Weber, 1995).
In both cases, the Gibbs phenomenon can be used as an ex-
cellent indicator of a singularity.

The example corresponding to the case (i) is given in
Appendix D, where truncated Fourier series of a function
with inﬁnite discontinuity are demonstrated to exhibit typi-
cal Gibbs oscillations and an overshoot. For the case (ii), the
limiting Stokes wave can be used as an example because of
the sharp 120◦ corner at the crest corresponding to a discon-
tinuous ﬁrst derivative. Moreover, even regular Stokes waves
very close to the Stokes corner ﬂow also exhibit Gibbs os-
cillations when being approximated numerically, as was re-

vealed by Chandler and Graham (1993) from the analysis of
Nekrasov’s integral equation. The similar example obtained
using fractional and ordinary Fourier expansions is presented
in Fig. 6 for the Stokes wave at A = 0.14106 (
99.9975%
of the limiting steepness A
0.1410635). The Gibbs phe-
≈
nomenon is distinctly observed even though the exact solu-
tion is known to be not sharp-crested. The possible reason
is that it has discontinuous derivatives higher than the ﬁrst
one being continuous. One can notice from Fig. 6 that the
overshoot shrinks both in vertical and horizontal scales with
increasing the accuracy of approximations in contrast to the
example with inﬁnite discontinuity, where the height of the
overshoot remains almost constant (see Fig. D1).

≈

Now let us analyse how an approximate irregular ﬂow
at ﬁxed steepness depends on improving its numerical ac-
curacy and make a comparison with two examples consid-
ered above. In Fig. 7, the proﬁles of the irregular ﬂow at
A = 0.14092 are plotted for several approximations obtained
using fractional and ordinary Fourier expansions, the corre-
sponding ﬂow parameters being presented in Table 3. The
following aspects can be emphasized.

1) The overshoot shrinks both in vertical and horizontal
scales as the accuracy of expansions is improved, in the same
way as for the almost limiting Stokes wave in Fig. 6. The
horizontal and vertical dimensions of the overshoot both be-
come approximately ﬁve times as small when using more ac-
curate fractional approximations instead of ordinary Fourier
approximations. And the distance η(0)
ys between the
wave crest and the stagnation point becomes approximately
four times as small. This correlates with decreasing the max-
imal relative error Ermax of the solutions approximately by a
factor of six. The conclusion can be made that the overshoot
is likely to shrink into a single point when increasing accu-
racy further similar to the case of the almost limiting Stokes
wave.

−

2) The overshoot has an almost ﬁxed vertical position in
contrast to the example with inﬁnite discontinuity in Fig. D1,

12

Lukomsky and Gandzha: Fractional Fourier approximations

where the overshoot moves to inﬁnity as accuracy is im-
proved. This indicates that if the proﬁles of irregular ﬂows
are indeed discontinuous they seem to exhibit a ﬁnite discon-
tinuity. The wave height η(0) quickly stabilizes with increas-
ing accuracy and seems not to tend to the height of the Stokes
corner ﬂow.

−

3) The particle velocity at the crest q(0)

c in the wave
related frame of reference decreases but much less rapidly
than the relative error Ermax of the corresponding solutions.
4) The minimal slope αmin in the Gibbs oscillations of the
wave proﬁle decreases, the oscillatory tails approaching the
horizontal line. This may be the indication that the proﬁle
has two symmetric ﬁnite discontinuities in the vicinity of the
wave crest.

These observations and the data presented do not give the
ﬁnal understanding of irregular ﬂows at N
. At present,
we can only guess what exact solutions to the equations of
motion irregular waves do approximate. We admit the fol-
lowing two alternatives.

→ ∞

−

(i) The particle velocity at the crest q(0)

c drops to zero,
the overshoot shrinks into a single point, and the stagnation
point merges with the wave crest. Then irregular ﬂows ap-
proximate a family of sharp-crested corner ﬂows similar to
the Stokes corner ﬂow but of lesser steepness.
(ii) The particle velocity at the crest q(0)

c does not tend
to zero and the stagnation point remains in the ﬂow domain.
Then irregular ﬂows are indeed discontinuous and their pro-
ﬁles are not single-valued and have two symmetric ﬁnite dis-
continuities in the vicinity of the wave crest.

−

Further investigation is necessary to single out one of these

possibilities or probably to come to some other conclusion.

5 Conclusions

Fractional Fourier approximations for the velocity potential
in combination with non-linear transformation of the hori-
zontal scale, which concentrates a numerical emphasis on
the crest region, turned out to be much more efﬁcient than
ordinary Fourier approximations when computing both steep
regular and irregular ﬂows. Nevertheless, further improve-
ment of the numerical algorithm is necessary to achieve the
accuracy of Tanaka’s method when calculating almost lim-
iting Stokes waves and to attain the ﬁnal understanding of
irregular ﬂows. One of the possible ways is to use the fol-
lowing multi-term fractional expansion with several different
parameters yk:

Although the proposed approach was formulated in the
framework of the canonical model for inﬁnite depth, its prac-
tical application is much broader. Gandzha et al. (2003) suc-
cessfully employed fractional approximations for computing
gravity-capillary waves. When y0 is located inside the ﬂow

domain fractional approximations may be applied for calcu-
lating vortex structures and solitary waves. The latter possi-
bility was realized by Clamond (2003) using his renormal-
ized cnoidal wave approximation (the ﬁrst term of the frac-
tional Fourier approximation). He computed an algebraic
solitary wave on deep water and traced how it changes after
taking into account surface tension (it is not known, however,
how this algebraic solution depends on picking up higher
terms of the fractional expansion). In the case of ﬁnite depth
h, the fractional Fourier expansion will be as follows:

Finally, fractional expansions may also be generalized to the
case of 3D waves and non-ideal ﬂuid.

Fractional approximations allowed us to gain more de-
tailed knowledge about the properties of irregular ﬂows. Ir-
regular waves were proved to correspond to singular solu-
tions of the equations of motion. Because of this their ex-
istence does not contradict to the uniqueness theorem of
Garabedian (1965) since it deals with regular continuous so-
lutions only. The following two alternatives for the exact
solutions associated with approximate irregular ﬂows were
singled out: (i) the proﬁle of an exact solution is continuous
with sharp corner at the crest (a discontinuous ﬁrst derivative)
similar to the limiting Stokes wave but is of lesser steepness;
(ii) the proﬁle of an exact solution has two symmetric ﬁnite
discontinuities in the vicinity of the wave crest and is not
single-valued. Further analysis, however, should be carried
out to make a ﬁnal conclusion. One of the possible ways is
to investigate how an approximate irregular ﬂow depends on
taking into account surface tension and to make a comparison
with new limiting forms for gravity-capillary waves recently
obtained by Debiane and Kharif (1996).

To conclude note that the formation of jets from irregular
progressive waves resembles the occurence of vertical jets
with sharp-pointed tips from standing gravity waves forced
beyond the maximum height, as has recently been reported
by Longuet-Higgins (2001).

Appendix C The stagnation point

The point in the ﬂow ﬁeld, where ﬂuid particles are mo-
tionless in the wave related frame of reference, is called the
stagnation point. For symmetric regular/irregular ﬂows, the
stagnation point is located above/below the wave crest out-
side/inside the ﬂow domain on the axis θ = 0. Then its ver-
tical position ys is determined as follows

Φθ(0, ys) = c.

(C1)

To ﬁnd the velocity ﬁeld Φθ(θ, y), Φy(θ, y) in the in-
ﬁnitesimal vicinity θ = ˜θ (˜θ
0) of the
→
stagnation point it is sufﬁcient to linearize there the expan-
sions (27), (28) that represent exact velocity ﬁeld at N
.
→ ∞
For this, one should linearize the functions T n(θ, y) around
the stagnation point as follows
T (θ, y) = T (ys + ˜y + i˜θ) = T (ys) + T
T n(θ, y) = T n(ys) + nT

(ys)T n−1(ys)(˜y + i˜θ).

(ys)(˜y + i˜θ);

Then, after taking into account condition (C1), the Eqs. (5)
for particle trajectories attain the following form in the vicin-
ity of the stagnation point:

d˜y

= a˜θ; a = 2c

nβnT

′

(ys)T n−1(ys).

∞

Xn=1

±

Therefore, the equations for the streamlines are ˜θ =
˜y.
Actually, this is a direct consequence of the fact that any so-
lution to the Laplace equation (1) should depend not on the
variables (θ, y) separately but on their combination y + iθ.

Thus, the streamlines meet at right angles (90◦) at the stag-
nation point. This fact is valid for any ﬂow provided that the
stagnation point and the wave crest do not merge. Otherwise,
ys = η(0); ˜θ and ˜x are not independent variables, and lin-
earization (C2) is not valid. The known example is the lim-
iting Stokes corner, where the streamlines turn out to meet
at 120◦ angle, as was at ﬁrst shown by Stokes (1880). The
question appears then what is a physical background for such
a sharp transition from 90◦ to 120◦ angle when proceeding
from regular Stokes ﬂows to the Stokes corner ﬂow? Grant
(1973) conjectured that a continuous approach to the limit-
ing Stokes wave is possible only if the Stokes corner ﬂow
has several coalescing singularities. The existence of irregu-
lar ﬂows may give answer where these multiple singularities
arise from. The Stokes corner ﬂow seems to be formed due to
merging the stagnation points of regular and irregular ﬂows.

Consider the following 2π-periodic function

(cid:12)

Z. This func-
with inﬁnite discontinuity at x = 2πk, k
tion constitutes a part of the kernel of Nekrasov’s integral
equation (see Chandler and Graham, 1993). The truncated
Fourier series of the function f (x) have the following form
(see Arfken and Weber, 1995):

In this case, the discontinuous function f (x) is approximated
by the continuous functions f (N )(x). One can see from
Fig. D1 that instead of inﬁnite discontinuities, the functions
f (N )(x) have rounded peaks (overshoots) with symmetric
oscillatory tails that descend as the distance from the point
of discontinuity increases. This is the well known Gibbs
phenomenon, which always takes place when approximating
discontinuous functions by the truncated Fourier series (see
Arfken and Weber, 1995). As the number N is increased,
the functions f (N )(x) approximate the function f (x) more
precisely. The peak moves upwards and the oscillatory tails

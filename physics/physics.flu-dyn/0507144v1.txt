We investigate the locality of interactions in hydrodynamic turbulence using data from a direct
numerical simulation on a grid of 10243 points; the ﬂow is forced with the Taylor-Green vortex.
An inertial range for the energy is obtained in which the ﬂux is constant and the spectrum follows
an approximate Kolmogorov law. Nonlinear triadic interactions are dominated by their non-local
components, involving widely separated scales. The resulting nonlinear transfer itself is local at
each scale but the step in the energy cascade is independent of that scale and directly related to
the integral scale of the ﬂow. Interactions with large scales represent 20% of the total energy ﬂux.
Possible explanations for the deviation from self-similar models, the link between these ﬁndings and
intermittency, and their consequences for modeling of turbulent ﬂows are brieﬂy discussed.

Flows in nature are often in a turbulent state driven
by large scale forcing (e.g. novae explosions in the in-
terstellar medium) or by instabilities (e.g. convection in
the sun). Such ﬂows involve a huge number of coupled
modes leading to great complexity both in their tempo-
ral dynamics and in the physical structures that emerge.
Many scales are excited, for example from the planetary
scale to the kilometer for convective clouds in the atmo-
sphere, and much smaller scales when considering micro-
processes such as droplet formation. The question then
arises concerning the nature of the interactions between
such scales: are they predominantly local, involving only
eddies of similar size, or are they as well non-local? It is
usually assumed that the dominant mode of interaction
is the former, and this hypothesis is classically viewed as
underlying the Kolmogorov phenomenology that leads to
the prediction of a E(k) ∼ k−5/3 energy spectrum; such
a spectrum has been observed in a variety of contexts al-
though there may be small corrections to this power-law
due to the presence in the small scales of strong localized
structures, such as vortex ﬁlaments [1].

Several studies have been devoted to assess the de-
gree of locality of nonlinear interactions, either through
modeling of turbulent ﬂows, as is the case with rapid
distortion theory (RDT) [2] or Large Eddy Simulations
(LES) [3], or through the analysis of direct numerical sim-
ulations (DNS) of the Navier-Stokes equations (see e.g.
[3, 4, 5]), and more recently through rigorous bounds [6].
The spatial resolution in the numerical investigations was
moderate, without a clearly deﬁned inertial range and
the diﬀerentiation between local and non-local interac-
tions was somewhat limited. Thus, a renewed analysis at
substantially higher Reynolds numbers in the absence of
any modeling is in order; we address this issue by ana-
lyzing data stemming from a newly performed DNS on a
grid of 10243 points using periodic boundary conditions.

The governing Navier-Stokes equation for an incom-
pressible velocity ﬁeld v, with P the pressure, F a forcing

term and ν = 3 × 10−4 the viscosity, reads:

∂v
∂t

+ v · ∇v = −∇P + ν∇2v + F

(1)

together with ∇ · v = 0. Speciﬁcally, we consider the
swirling ﬂow resulting from the Taylor-Green vortex [7]:

FTG(k0) = 2F 

with k0 = 2. This forcing generates cells that have locally
diﬀerential rotation and helicity, although its net helicity
is zero. The resulting ﬂow models the ﬂuid between two
counter-rotating cylinders [7] and has been used widely to
study turbulence, including studies in the context of the
generation of magnetic ﬁelds through dynamo instability
[8]. The Reynolds number based on the integral scale L ≡
E(k)k−1dk/E ≈ 1.2 (where E is the total energy),
2π
is Re ≡ U L/ν ≈ 4000, where U is the r.m.s velocity.
The Reynolds number based on the Taylor scale λ ≡
2π(E/

k2E(k)dk)1/2 ≈ 0.24, is Rλ ≈ 800.

The code uses a dealiased pseudo-spectral method,
with maximum wavenumber kmax = 341 and kmaxη =
1.15, where 2πη = 2π(ν3/ǫ)1/4 is the dissipation scale
and ǫ is the energy injection rate:
the ﬂow is suﬃ-
ciently resolved since 1/η is within the boundaries of the
wavenumbers handled explicitly in the computation.

Details of the ﬂow dynamics will be reported elsewhere;
suﬃce it to say that the ﬂow reproduces classical features
of isotropic turbulence [9]: the energy spectrum is well-
developed (see Fig. 1) with a constant energy ﬂux for
k ∈ [5, 20] and maximally helical vortex tubes are found,
as predicted in [10] and shown in [11, 12]. Finally, the
anomalous exponents of longitudinal structure functions
are in excellent agreement with previous studies [1] up
to order p = 8 (see Table I), including analysis without
using the extended self-similarity (ESS) hypothesis [13].
To investigate the interactions between diﬀerent scales
we split the velocity ﬁeld into spherical shells in Fourier

2

T3(K, P, Q) (a third-order correlator) from energy in shell
Q to energy in shell K due to the interaction with the
velocity ﬁeld in shell P is deﬁned as usual [15, 16] as:

T3(K, P, Q) = −

vK · (vP · ∇)vQdx3 .

Z

If we sum over the middle wave number P we obtain the
total energy transfer T2(K, Q) from shell Q to shell K:

T2(K, Q) =

T3(K, P, Q) = −

vK · (v · ∇)vQdx3

.

Positive transfer implies that energy is transfered from
shell Q to K, and negative from K to Q; thus, both
T3 and T2 are antisymmetric in their (K, Q) arguments.
T2(K, Q) gives information on the shell-to-shell energy
transfer between K and Q, but not about the local-
ity or non-locality of the triadic interactions themselves.
The energy ﬂux plotted in Fig.

Q T2(K, Q). Note that the transfer terms de-
ﬁned in Eqs. (3,4) are integrated over all volume in real
space. Since in periodic boundary conditions there is no
net ﬂux of energy through the walls, this is enough to en-
sure that contributions due to advection (which do not
lead to cascade of energy to smaller scales) cancel out
(see e.g. [6]).

Figure 2 shows the energy transfer T2(K, Q) plotted as
a function of K − Q for 70 diﬀerent values of Q varying
from 10 to 80. For each value of Q, the x axis shows the
diﬀerent K shells giving or receiving energy from that
shell Q. All curves collapse to a single one: the energy in
shell K is received locally from shells with wavenumber
K − ∆K and deposited mostly in the vicinity of K + ∆K,
with ∆K ∼ k0 for all values in the inertial range.
In
other words, the integral scale of the ﬂow, related to the
−1
forcing scale k
0 , plays a determinant role in the process
of energy transfer. As a result, the transfer is not self-
similar, and the integral length scale is remembered even
deep inside the constant-ﬂux inertial range.

This break down of self-similarity indicates that dom-
inant triadic interactions can be non-local. To examine
further this point, we need to investigate individual tri-
adic interactions between Fourier shells by considering
the tensorial transfer T3(K, P, Q). We will study three
values of Q, (Q = 10, 20, and 40); for each case, P will
run from 1 to 80, and K from Q − 12 to Q + 12.

In ﬁgure 3 we show contour levels of the transfer
T3(K, P, Q) for Q = 40. This ﬁgure represents energy
going from a shell Q to a shell K through interactions
with modes in the shell P . As in Fig. 2, positive trans-
fer means the shell K receives energy from the shell Q,
while negative transfer implies the shell K gives energy
to Q. The strongest interactions occur with P ∼ k0, and
therefore the large scale ﬂow is involved in most of the
T2 transfer of energy from small scales to smaller scales.

vK where vK is the
space of unit width, i.e. v =
ﬁltered velocity ﬁeld with K ≤ |k| < K + 1 (from now on
called shell K) [14]. Usually, octave bands are used to
deﬁne the shells (i.e. shells of width ∆K n are used, where
∆K is a constant often set to 2). This choice is based on
the usual hypothesis that interactions are mostly local
and self-similar in Fourier space, i.e. the nonlinear term
in eq. (1) couples triads of modes (k, p, q) in Fourier space
with k ∼ p ∼ q. Since we want to verify these hypotheses,
we choose to use a linear step for the shells. This election
does not imply any loss of generality, and if interactions
are indeed local our results should be compatible with
results using octave bands.
From equation (1),

dent of K and all the peaks are at K − Q ∼ k0.

elongated, corresponding to more nonlocal interactions.
As a result, detailed interactions between triads of modes
are nonlocal, while the transfer of energy T2(K, Q) takes
place between neighboring shells:
local energy transfer
occurs through non-local interactions. These results sup-
port previous claims at smaller resolution [3, 4, 5] that
a signiﬁcant role in the cascade of energy in the iner-
tial range is played by the large scale components of the
velocity ﬁeld.

However, when computing the energy ﬂux through a
shell k, i.e. integrating T2(K, Q) over all values of Q, and
K from 0 to k, these non-local interactions give ∼ 20% of
the total ﬂux, since many more local triads contribute in
the global summation. We note that this fraction (20%)
is independent of k, provided that k is large enough and
in the inertial range.

We are left therefore with two puzzles. First, why is
the large scale ﬂow more eﬀective (at the level of individ-
ual triadic interactions) in “destroying” small size eddies
than similar size eddies, when phenomenological argu-
ments in the Kolmogorov spirit suggest otherwise? And
secondly, why is the energy spectrum so close to k−5/3 in
the constant ﬂux region, when just advection by the large
scale ﬂow would suggest a shallower spectrum ∼ k−1?
(see e.g. [2]). In what follows, we give a brief review of
possible answers as well as a simple model that shows
how a k−5/3 energy spectrum can be obtained by advec-
tion and stretching of the small scales just by the large
scale ﬂow.

A possible answer to explain the strong non-local tri-
adic interactions is that the Reynolds number in the
present simulation is not high enough to observe dom-
inance of local triads, and the decrease in amplitude of
the small scale ﬁelds due to viscosity makes this interac-
tions (when compared to the large scale ﬂow) smaller.

Another possible answer would be that the wavenum-
ber bands deﬁning the local interactions (i.e. the range
of values in P used to deﬁne T Loc
), that were arbitrarily
taken here to have a width of 2n, could be as wide as 10n
as some authors suggest [5]. If this is the case, a DNS
with an inertial range that spans at least three orders of
magnitude in wavenumbers would be required to actually
observe strong local interactions.

2

However, neither of these answers address the second
question concerning why a Kolmogorov energy spectrum
is observed at moderate values of the Reynolds number.
If we look at phenomenological scaling arguments, we
see that there is one major assumption that may not be
satisﬁed. Current models assume that the energy is dis-
tributed in a hierarchy of vortices of size L, L/α, L/α2, ...
(with α > 1), with no speciﬁc geometry. However, ex-
periments as well as numerical simulations have shown
that enstrophy is distributed in vortex tubes, where two
distinct length scales can be identiﬁed: one is the width
of the tube l that is typically small and varies, and one is
its length L, typically of the order of the integral scale.

for Q = 40. Solid lines correspond to positive transfer, and
dotted lines to negative transfer.

(K, Q) (dotted line), and T3(K, P = 3, Q) (dashed
line), for three values of Q.

Note that the individual triadic interactions with P ∼ k0
and K ∼ Q ± k0 are two orders of magnitude larger than
local triadic interactions.

When T3(K, P, Q) in Fig. 4 is summed over all val-
ues of P , the transfer function T2(K, Q) is recovered.
This allow us to deﬁne the transfer rate due to inter-
actions with the large scale ﬂow, and due to local in-
teractions, summing P over diﬀerent ranges.
Indeed,
to further illustrate the dominance of the large scale
ﬂow in the involved interactions, we compare in Fig.
4 the total transfer function T2(K, Q) with the trans-
fer due to the large scale ﬂow T3(K, P = 3, Q), and
with the transfer due to local
interactions in octave
2Q
bands T Loc
(K, Q) =
P =Q/2 T3(K, P, Q). The ﬁgure
indicates that the transfer due to the local interactions
(Q/2 < P < 2Q) is smaller than the transfer due to the
integral length scale velocity ﬁeld, and this behavior ap-
pears to be stronger as the value of Q is increased. The
remaining transfer comes from interactions with P -shells
with wavenumbers between 1 and Q/2 (excluding P = 3),
which are also non-local in nature. Therefore, as K and Q
get larger (as we go further down in the inertial range),
the dominant triads (K, P, Q) become more and more

P

It is not clear therefore when two such structures inter-
act, which length scale is responsible for determining the
time scale of the cascade.

From the analysis presented here, a simple model for
turbulent ﬂows consistent with several features observed
in simulations and experiments can emerge (see below).
First, recall that Ref. [12] found that helical vortex tubes
capture 99% of the energy, give a k−5/3 spectrum, and
are responsible for the strong wings in the PDF of ve-
locity gradients. Furthermore, it was shown in [2] that,
when decomposing the velocity ﬁeld in a large scale com-
ponent U and a small scale one u, artiﬁcially dropping
local interactions in a simulation (an operation akin to
RDT) gives enhanced intermittency (in the sense that a
stronger departure from linear scaling of anomalous ex-
ponents is observed), while when non-local interactions
are dropped the intermittency of the ﬂow decreases [17].
The data analyzed in the present paper implies that, at
low order of correlators, i.e. when considering the energy
ﬂux, the interactions are mostly local. But when going to
third-order individual triadic interactions (such as with
T3), the non-local components are dominant and involve
the integral scale. We note that this is consistent with the
fact that departures from a linear scaling by anomalous
exponents with the order of structure function is stronger
as the order is increased, since it involves more non-local
interactions linked to the geometrical structure of vortex
tubes. This leads to a model of small-scale interactions
involving three small scales that are substantially weak-
ened and gaussian, thus in agreement with the ﬁndings
in [2] that such uu-like terms weaken intermittency as
well when included in the full dynamics.

As a result, if we take into account the vortex tube
structure of a turbulent ﬂow, the picture of the classi-
cal Richardson cascade may change: a possible model
to explain the aforementioned results is to take the time
scale of the cascade as given by the geometric average of
the length scales involved, based on the cubic root of the
volume of the vortex tube. If this is the case, the energy
dissipation rate of vortex tubes with velocity ul due to the
l · UL/(l2L)1/3. This
large scale ﬂow UL is given by ǫ ∼ u2
implies that, for constant ﬂux, ul ∼ l1/3
ǫL1/3/UL; this
scaling recovers the Kolmogorov spectrum, although in a
diﬀerent spirit [18]. Note that the spirit of this derivation
is close to multifractal models used to explain intermit-
tency corrections [9].

p

Finally, we would like to point out that the success of
models involving as an essential agent of nonlinear trans-
fer the distortion of turbulent eddies by a large-scale ﬂow
– as in RDT and its variants [2] or as in the alpha model
[19] where the ﬂow is interacting with a smooth veloc-
ity ﬁeld (see also [20]) – may be in part explained by
the present ﬁndings that conﬁrm that nonlinear triadic
interactions are mostly nonlocal and involve the integral
scale. Similar results have already been obtained for ﬂows
coupled to a magnetic ﬁeld [16], where the weakening

4

of nonlinear interactions may occur in diﬀerent fashions,
e.g. Alfv´enization or force-free ﬁelds, and where the sec-
ond order transfer T2 between velocity and magnetic ﬁeld
in the induction equation is itself non-local.

[17] Note that in agreement with these arguments, MHD,
which is more non-local than neutral ﬂuids [16] is also
more intermittent as shown e.g. in H. Politano, A. Pou-

[18] Note that this is consistent with a Beltramization of the
ﬂow quenching small-scale interactions. Using the Batch-
elor analogy between vorticity and induction, and the
properties of the transfer in conducting ﬂuids [16], we
conjecture that the vorticity transfer itself will be non-
local; this allows for the existence of a non-Beltrami com-
ponent of nonlinear interactions which in turn could lead
to the possible development of singularities.

Vortex Stretching and Reconnection in a Compressible Fluid

Bhimsen K. Shivamoggi
University of Central Florida
Orlando, FL 32816

Abstract
Vortex stretching in a compressible ﬂuid is considered. Two-dimensional (2D) and axisymmetric
cases are considered separately. The ﬂows associated with the vortices are perpendicular to the plane
of the uniform straining ﬂows. Externally-imposed density build-up near the axis leads to enhanced
compactness of the vortices – “dressed” vortices (in analogy to “dressed” charged particles in a
dielectric system). The compressible vortex ﬂow solutions in the 2D as well as axisymmetric cases
identify a length scale relevant for the compressible case which leads to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili
spectrum for compressible turbulence. Vortex reconnection process in a compressible ﬂuid is shown
to be possible even in the inviscid case – compressibility leads to defreezing of vortex lines in the
ﬂuid.

Introduction

The vortex stretching process -

•

•

leads to the transport of energy among various scales of motion in a turbulent ﬂow,

plays an important role in the vortex reconnection process and hence in describing the ﬁne
scales of turbulence.

Vortex reconnection (Siggia and Pumir [1], Schatzle [2]) has been argued to be a prime candidate
for a ﬁnite-time singularity in Euler equations. Such a singularity plays a central role in the small-
scale dynamics of turbulence by producing arbitrarily large velocity gradients. However, vortex
reconnection is a process that is not yet well understood. Certain “canonical” cases of vortex
reconnection have been investigated in great detail, both experimentally (Fohl and Turner, [3],
Oshima and Asaka [4]) and numerically (Ashurst and Meiron [5], Pumir and Kerr, [6], Kida and
Takaoka [7] and others). But, a global view of the various reconnection scenarios is not at hand yet.
[9]) and DNS (Jimenez et al.
[10]) have revealed strong coherent and elongated vortices among the small scales in incompressible
turbulence. These vortices are believed to originate from strained vorticity ﬁelds like the Burgers

Laboratory Experiments (Cadot et al.

[8], Villermaux et at.

vortex (Burgers [11]). Burgers vortex describes the interplay between the intensiﬁcation of vorticity
due to the imposed straining ﬂow and the diﬀusion of vorticity due to the action of viscosity. The
straining simulates locally the stretching undergone by each vortex in the velocity ﬁeld induced by
other vortices.
Intermittency structures that exhibit velocity proﬁles similar to that of Burgers
vortex have been observed in grid turbulence (Mouri et al. [12]).

The two-dimensional (2D) Burgers vortex solution is of the form (Robinson and Saﬀman [13])

-

v =

αx + u(x, y, t),

βy + v(x, y, t), (α + β)z

.

{−

−

}

(1)

The quantity (α+β) (α and β > 0) measures the stretching rate of vortices, which are aligned along
the z-axis (that is also the principal axis of a uniform plane straining ﬂow). Numerical solutions
of three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes equations (Ashurst et al. [14] and others) have conﬁrmed
the alignment between the vorticity and one principal axis of the local strain. The velocity induced
by the vorticity lies in the xy-plane, with components u and v which are independent of z. Simple
closed-form steady solutions exist for the following special cases -

α = β > 0 - axisymmetric vortex
α > 0, β = 0 - 2D shear layer.

•
•

Robinson and Saﬀman [13] demonstrated the existence of solutions for arbitrary values of the ratio
α/β.

Unsteady 2D Burgers vortex solutions have been used to model the spanwise structure of tur-
bulent mixing layers (Lin and Corcos [15], Neu [16]). Unsteady axisymmetric Burgers vortex solu-
tions have been used to model the ﬁne-scale structure of homogeneous incompressible turbulence
(Townsend [17], Lundgren [18]).

DNS (Porter et al.

[19]) have conﬁrmed the existence of vortex ﬁlaments in compressible
turbulence. The vortex stretching process can be expected to be inﬂuenced in an essential way
by ﬂuid compressibility (Shivamoggi [20] and [21]). So, investigation of stretched vortices in a
compressible ﬂuid is in order which is addressed in this paper along with applications to compressible
turbulence.

Vortex reconnection in a compressible ﬂuid is a topic in its infancy (Virk et al. [22] and Shiva-
moggi [23]). Additional mechanisms of vorticity generation like the baroclinic vorticity generation
exist in a compressible ﬂuid. The vortex reconnection process in a compressible ﬂuid is therefore
more complicated than its counterpart in an incompressible ﬂuid. Further exploration of the basic
mechanism underlying this process is in order and is addressed in general terms in this paper.

2 Modiﬁed 2D Burgers Vortex

Consider a modiﬁed Burgers vortex ﬂow with the velocity ﬁeld given by

v =

.
γ(t)x, γ(t)y, W (x, t)
}

{−

(2)

(2) describes the convection of the vortex lines toward the y-axis and the stretching along the
y-axis by the imposed straining ﬂow. The straining ﬂow is externally imposed, so the vorticity is
decoupled from the dynamics of the straining ﬂow that is stretching it. The streamlines (see Figure
1) shown in the x, y-plane represent the uniform plane straining ﬂow. This streamline pattern is
the same in each plane parallel to the x, y-plane. Observe that the ﬂow associated with the vortex
in question is perpendicular to the plane of the uniform straining ﬂow, unlike the Burgers vortex
given by (1). This situation is well-suited for modelling a mixing-layer ﬂow or jet ﬂow. (2) describes
the convection of the vortex lines towards the x = 0 plane and the stretching in the y-direction by
the imposed straining ﬂow.

For this shear-layer ﬂow solution, the build-up of vorticity due to the convection of the vortex
lines towards the x = 0 plane and the stretching in the y-direction by the imposed straining ﬂow is
counterbalanced by the diﬀusion of vorticity in the x-direction.

3 Compressible Modiﬁed 2D Burgers Vortex

Let us now consider the modiﬁed 2D Burgers vortex in a compressible barotropic ﬂuid. For this
purpose, let the velocity and density proﬁles be given by (Shivamoggi [20]) -

v =

˙α(t)x, ˙β(t)y, W (x, t)

ρ = σ(t) +

where ρ0 and U are reference density and velocity, respectively. (17) describes a density build-up
(or decay) in the direction along which vortex lines are being compressed by the imposed straining
ﬂow. This arrangement maximizes compressibility eﬀects on the vortex stretching process.

In order to simplify equation (32), let us assume that the compressibility eﬀects are weak. From

in the weakly-compressible case, equation (28) (which, to ﬁrst approximation, is automatically
satisﬁed) does not lead to equation (29) which, therefore, has to be abandoned. This implies that
the ﬁrst of the three solutions in (31), which comes from equation (29), has to be dropped, as in
the 2D case.

Thus, keeping only terms of O(c), and introducing dimensionless independent variables -

Comparison of equation (36) with the corresponding equation (8) for the incompressible case
shows that the last term on the right hand side in equation (36) represents the ﬁrst-order contribu-
tion due to the compressibility eﬀects (assumed to be weak). Further, observe that the compress-
ibility eﬀects impart hyperbolic character to equation (36), associated with sound-wave propagation
in the ﬂuid.

As a ﬁrst approximation, if we ignore the time-dependence of the straining-ﬂow proﬁles, and

hence, ˜c(τ ), and treat ˜c(τ ) as a constant, equation (36) can be solved exactly to give

Comparison of the compressible vortex proﬁle (37) with the corresponding compressible vortex
proﬁle (13), (15) and (16) shows that, for the 2D case, the ﬁrst-order eﬀect of compressibility is
to cause a mere Galilean translation in space of the incompressible vortex proﬁles. Therefore, in
order to capture non-trivial eﬀects of compressibility in the 2D case one needs to consider the
time dependence of the straining-ﬂow proﬁles. This restriction turns out to be relaxed for the
axisymmetric case (below).

4 Compressible Axisymmetric Stretched Vortex

Consider an axisymmetric stretched vortex in a compressible barotropic ﬂuid (Shivamoggi [21]).
Let the velocity (in cylindrical polar coordinates (r, θ, z)) and the density proﬁles be given by1 -

where ρ0 and U are reference density and velocity, respectively. (38) describes a density build-up (or
decay) towards the axis (which is also the direction along which vortex lines are being compressed
by the imposed straining ﬂow).

The vorticity ﬁeld corresponding to (38) is

where

(39) shows that the vortex lines for this model are aligned along the z-axis, which happens to be
the direction of the principal extensional strain associated with the axisymmetric uniform straining
ﬂow (38). Further, the ﬂow associated with the vortex is again perpendicular to the plane of the
uniform straining ﬂow, a situation that is well suited to modeling an axisymmetric mixing-layer
ﬂow. (38) describes the convection of the vortex lines towards the z-axis and the stretching along
the z-axis by the imposed straining ﬂow.

Using (38), the mass-conservation equation (18) yields

The exponential decay of the vorticity for large r signiﬁes the enhanced compactness of the vor-

“dressed ” vortex in analogy with the terminology in the dielectric screening of a charged particle
polarizing the surrounding medium (Ashcroft and Mermin [25])! “Dressed ” vortex owes its extis-
tence to a counter-conventional externally-imposed density build-up in the vortex core2 (which is
in contrast to a density drop in the vortex core in a normal compressible case).

2Such vortices do not appear to be stable because the density increase in a direction opposite to that of the
eﬀective gravity due to the centrifugal force (which is directed away from the axis) would correspond to a top heavy
arrangement under gravity. Indeed, swirling ﬂows are found to be stabilized by a density stratiﬁcation increasing in
the radial direction (Howard [26]) while the vortex breakdown process is found to be delayed by the latter type of
density stratiﬁcation (Shivamoggi and Uberoi [27]).

3The case a(t) = const, according to (51), is valid only in the weak-compressibility limit (small c), and in the

generic situation (arbitrary c) it is not valid.

6 Vortex Reconnection in a Compressible Fluid

We consider a generalization of Greene’s [30] local vortex pseudo-advection (the terminology is,
however, due to Vallis et al. [31]) to make a general discussion of the vortex reconnection process
in a compressible ﬂuid.

The vorticity evolution equation in an inviscid ﬂuid is

∂t

(ω

v) =

(cid:19)

The term on the right represents baroclinic vorticity generation which is due to the misalignment
of density and pressure gradients. Note that for an incompressible or a compressible barotropic
ﬂuid this term vanishes, so the vorticity evolution in an inviscid incompressible or a compressible
barotropic ﬂuid is simply a local vortex advection signifying the absence of vortex reconnection.

On the other hand, for a compressible non-barotropic ﬂuid, if

V being the volume occupied by the ﬂuid,
(p = const) surfaces, then one may write

i.e., the vortex lines are conﬁned to the isobaric

Equation (79) then becomes

(82) implies that, under condition (80), the vorticity evolution in a compressible non-barotropic
ﬂuid corresponds to a local vortex pseudo-advection by a modiﬁed velocity v + W where, from (81),

∇ ×

Further, the helicity

(86)

So, provided (80) is valid, the total helicity is conserved, even in a compressible non-barotropic
ﬂuid, despite the existence of baroclinic vorticity generation mechanism.

It should be noted however that the prevalence of local vortex pseudo-advection and hence the
absence of vortex reconnection is a suﬃcient (but not necessary) condition for conserving the total
helicity also in a compressible ﬂuid. Therefore, the absence of local vortex pseudo-advection and
hence the occurrence of vortex reconnection does not guarantee the destruction of the total helicity
invariant.

In the generic compressible non-barotropic case, where (80) is not valid, the vorticity evolution
does not correspond to a local vortex pseudo-advection. This paves the way for the occurrence of
vortex reconnection in a compressible non-barotropic ﬂuid even in the inviscid case! DNS of the
reconnection process between two anti-parallel vortex tubes (Virk et al. [22]) in fact showed that
shocklet formation was able to get reconnection going in a compressible ﬂuid.

Inviscid compressible vortex reconnection is very akin to the collisionless magnetic reconnection
process in high-temperature tenuous plasmas where resistivity is negligible (Coppi [32], Schindler
[33], Drake and Lee [34], Ottaviani and Porcelli [35], Shivamoggi [36]-[38]). Here, the conservation
of magnetic ﬂux is replaced by the conservation of generalized magnetic ﬂux (that now includes
contributions from the electron-ﬂuid momentum). So, magnetic ﬂux changes and magnetic recon-
nection processes are sustainable even without resistivity!

7 Discussion

In this paper, stretched (modiﬁed Burgers) vortices are considered in a compressible ﬂuid. The
ﬂows associated with the vortices are perpendicular to the plane of the uniform straining ﬂows – a
situation relevant for a mixing-layer ﬂows. Compressibility eﬀects have been restricted to be weak
to facilitate analytic solutions. The compressible axisymmetric stretched vortex -

•

exhibits exponential decay of the vorticity for large r signifying the enhanced compactness
of the vortices caused by an externally-imposed density build-up near the axis – “dressed”
vortices,

has the axisymmetric Burgers vortex as the asymptotic limit (t

).

•
The compressible vortex ﬂow solutions in the 2D as well as axisymmetric cases identify a length
scale relevant for the compressible case which leads to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili [29] spectrum
for compressible turbulence.

⇒ ∞

Vortex reconnection in a compressible non-barotropic ﬂuid is possible even in the inviscid case –
compressibility leads to defreezing of vortex lines in the ﬂuid. This is very similar to the collisionless
magnetic reconnection process in high-temperature tenuous plasmas.

The possibility of vortex reconnection in an inviscid ﬂuid can raise some questions of principle (´a
la Taylor, as quoted in [35], for the collisionless magnetic reconnection process). Since the process
is reversible one might wonder if the reconnection in such a system is only a transient phenomenon
and if the vortex lines will eventually unreconnect. However, the essential presence of even a very
small viscosity would inhibit the latter process.

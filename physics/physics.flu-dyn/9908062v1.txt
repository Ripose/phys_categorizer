Microscopic discontinuity of ﬂuids

Abstract: We reveal that realistic ﬂuids generate microscopic-level discontinu-
ity constantly and the discontinuity spreads out with motion of particles rather
rapidly and widely. These things cannot be treated by the standard kinetic
equations, and thus the existing ﬂuid theories, macroscopic ones and micro-
scopic ones, need to be revised considerably.

It has been unanimously believed that the following standard framework[1][2]

↓

BBGKY hierarchy equations

↓

Equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena

gives sound microscopic and macroscopic descriptions of all classical ﬂuids ob-
served in the physical reality.

Nevertheless, discoveries in various ﬁelds, such as those related to turbulence,
chaos and dissipative structures, constantly revealed ﬂuid phenomena that ap-
pear to be inconsistent with our existing theoretical knowledge. In the studies
of statistical behavior of charged particles[3][4], we ourselves were in trouble to
construct intuition out of what was obtained from the kinetic equations. The
situation motivated us to make a lot of investigation on related fundamental
subjects and ﬁnally resulted in our critical attitude toward the existing kinetic
theory.

In the usual textbook elaboration of the kinetic theory[5][1], all the particles
are at ﬁrst assumed to make motion in the way as if they constitute a contin-
uous medium and the mediumlike behavior is cast into a diﬀerential operator
similar to that in ﬂuid mechanics; an integral operator, as a correction term,
is then attached, in which particles interact with each other as if they are or-
dinary colliding particles.
In our view, the formalism, though seems to give
a comprehensive description of the two contradictory aspects, medium aspect
and particle aspect, runs into conceptual diﬃculties. According to the theory,
if the number of particles becomes more and more (the gas becomes denser
and denser), then the collisional term becomes overwhelming; otherwise, the

1

medium aspect becomes more important. (In some textbook, it is explicitly
stated that if the collisions between particles are not signiﬁcant the Boltzmann
equation is reduced to the collisionless Boltzmann equation, called sometimes
the Vlasov equation.) However, this picture is not in harmony with the simple
physical intuition which says that a “ﬂuid” consisting of a very small number
of particles behaves as a collection of particles only. The particles in such a
“ﬂuid” move like individual particles and collide with each other like individual
particles; no mediumlike character can be observed.

In this letter, we will investigate the issue thoroughly.

It will be shown
that a realistic Boltzmann gas (by “Boltzmann gas” we mean a gas in which
interforces between particles are short-ranged) is capable of generating several
kinds of discontinuous distribution functions and the dynamical behavior of such
distribution functions is far from mediumlike and cannot be described by the
existing kinetic theory.

We start our discussion by recalling the standard kinetic equations brieﬂy.

These equations can be written in the following unifying form

∂
∂t

+ v ·

∂
∂r

F
m

·

∂
∂v (cid:19)

f =

δt (cid:19)collision

,

(cid:18)

where the right side represents an integral collisional operator, which takes
diﬀerent forms for diﬀerent kinetic equations. For purposes of this paper, we
conﬁne ourselves to a gas in which collisions are not signiﬁcant. Under this
understanding, Eq. (1) becomes

Moving together with one particle in the ﬂuid, we simply ﬁnd that the equation
can be expressed as a convective derivative

In words, this is to say that the distribution function keeps invariant along any
particle path in the six-dimensional phase space (µ-space).

The invariance expressed by (3) is quite amazing in the sense that the dis-
tribution function can have such nice and regular behavior while each particle
in the ﬂuid seems free to make any kinds of motions, including some “irregular
ones”. This is by no means possible and seeking for hidden requirements is
kind of necessary. A careful inspection leads us to the following three require-
ments. (i) Throughout the dynamical process, the distribution function must
be continuous both in terms of position and in terms of velocity. (ii) The force
term F in the equation must be free from dissipation. (iii) No stochastic forces
(collision-type) get involved, namely the force F must be suﬃciently smooth in

space. In what follows, we are mainly concerned with the ﬁrst requirement and
it will be shown that a realistic ﬂuid can constantly generate discontinuity at
the miroscopic level and the discontinuity spread out rather rapidly and widely.

Firstly, consider a piece of boundary shown in Fig. 1. On the right side
of it, there are particles belonging to an ordinary gas initially. Suppose that
we are able to observe these particles continuously. It is easy to ﬁnd that the
distribution function at every point on the left side of the boundary involves
discontinuity in terms of velocity angle.

Then, let’s look at the particles leaking through a small hole of a gas con-
tainer (free-expansion gas), shown in Fig. 2. We can ﬁnd that the distribution
function related to all these particles is continuous in the position space but not
in the velocity space.

Actually, there are more sources of discontinuity. To get a complete knowl-
edge about this, it is instructive to study another kind of interaction between

3

particles and boundaries, collisions between particles and boundaries. Such col-
lisions are usually assumed to be kind of deterministic and the assumption is
adopted by many college-level textbooks[6], in which molecules are considered as
having hard-spheres, walls as perfectly smooth and collisions as classically elas-
tic, shown in Fig. 3. According to this elastic model, the distribution function
must keep invariant after the collisions, which partly explains why boundary
problems have not received much attention in the standard kinetic theory.

It is easy to see that the model outlined above is an ideal one serving for
educational purposes. Actual observations in ﬂuid mechanics tell us a diﬀerent
story[7]: the ﬂuid particles immediately next to a solid surface remain almost
stationary with respect to the surface (apparently in the average sense), shown
in Fig. 4. This is called the no-slip condition by scientists in ﬂuid mechanics.

To conform to the no-slip condition, a diﬀerent model, called the statistical
model, should be adopted. In this model, particles leave, after collisions, the
solid surface in the way as if they are emitted from there, and their velocities
will distribute according to a statistical law irrespective of how they come to
there. (Though more sophisticated models may be better oﬀ in the academic
sense, we take this simple one as our “zeroth-order approximation” for relative
simplicity.)

Taking this statistical model implies that we are ready not only to admit
that interaction between particles and boundaries is of a dissipative nature and
stochastic nature but also to admit that the distribution functions of emitted
particles are discontinuous: if the area of the surface is small enough the situ-
ation is like the gas leaking out of a container in Fig. 2; if the surface is of a
ﬁnite-size, the distribution function will be roughly the same as that created by
the ﬁnite boundary in Fig. 1.

Examples aforementioned have shown that realistic boundaries can indeed
generate, by blocking particles or by emitting particles, certain kinds of dis-
continuous distribution functions. A conception which may come to one’s mind
immediately is that by introducing the δ-function and/or the step function these
discontinuous distribution functions may be treatable as if they are continuous
ones. Such conceptions got a lot of successes in other physical ﬁelds, why not in
this ﬁeld? We will see, however, that the position-velocity phase space, in which
distribution functions are deﬁned, possesses special features and one of the fea-
tures is that the position r and the velocity v are assumed to be completely
independent of each other. (Note that we have v = ˙r for each particle in the
ﬂuid.) It is because of this assumption that the existing kinetic theory is inap-
plicable in the situations even if the δ-function and step-function are properly
introduced.

We investigate the following distribution function

f =

n0
r2 δ(v − v0
where n0 and v0 represent two constants, r the position vector and r = |r|. By
referring to Fig. 2, we can recognize that the distribution function characterizes
a kind of free expansion gas. The time development of these particles can be
expressed by

By a direct calculation, we know that along a particle trajectory

Actually, Fig. 2 can directly tell us that, in contrast with (3), the distribution
function is not invariant along the particle trajectories.

The diﬃculty becomes even more striking if we substitute the distribution
function (4) into the kinetic equation (2). The following two partial derivatives

It is obvious that the troublesome situation arises not
are rather puzzling.
because we do not know how to diﬀerentiate the δ-function but because we
cannot determine whether or not r and v correlate.

Up to now, we have seen that such discontinuous distribution functions pose
diﬃculty in the two related respects: (i) The discontinuity spreads throughout
almost the entire space instead of “staying” on certain boundaries. (ii) Since the
discontinuity spreads the distribution function must contain path information
of particles; this is in conﬂict with the partial-diﬀerential equations where r
and v are considered independent of each other. The latter respect, called the
paradox of r-v correlation in this letter, holds its signiﬁcance rather generally.
Before ﬁnishing this letter, it is important and relevant to look at whether
or not other related theories, such as the continuity equations and Liouville’s
theorem, hold in the presence of such discontinuity. (In fact, by referring to
the paradox of r-v correlation, readers themselve can come up with the answer
to the question without many studies.) Adopting that the force term in (2) is
independent of velocity, we ﬁnd that the collisionless Boltzmann equation (2) is
identical to the continuity equation in µ-space

∂f
∂t

∂(vf )
∂r

∂( ˙vf )

= 0.

(10)

It is then obvious that the continuity equation in µ-space does not generally
hold for discontinuous distribution functions.

In a similar way, it can be shown that the continuity equation in the grand
phase space (Γ-space), which can be regarded as a natural extension of the
continuity equation in µ-space, is not valid for systems having discontinuous
distribution functions.

Finally, we study a more fundamental issue: Is Liouville’s theorem applicable
in statistical mechanics? To get a deﬁnite answer to the question and, at the
same time, to gain insight into the important subject, it is necessary to examine
derivations of the theorem in detail.

In textbooks, one of the derivations is based on the continuity equation in
Γ-space and will be discussed no more. Another derivation[8], which invokes
the Hamiltonian formalism and the Jacobian approach, is worth our special
attention.

Suppose that the Hamiltonian of a system with 2N degrees of freedom is in

the form

H =

+ Φ(q1, q2, · · · , t).

We have explicitly assumed that the potential term Φ only contains the position
coordinates q1, q2, · · · and implicitly assumed that the potential term Φ is diﬀer-
entiable in terms of these coordinates. Note that these two things have deﬁned
the syatem as a pure mechanical one with no dissipative and stochastic forces
involved. Suppose that dΓ represents a phase volume element in Γ-space. One
version of Liouville’s theorem states that the value of dΓ is motion-invariant.

To prove it, we adopt that the time-development of the system is a canonical

transformation

p(t0), q(t0) → P (t), Q(t).

is the Jacobian of the transformation. By applying the properties of the canon-
ical transformation, we get (with the details omitted)

Equation (13) can then be written in the form

Eq. (16) is regarded as Liouville’s theorem in classical mechanics. To have
Liouville’s theorem in statistical mechanics, which states that the grand density
ρ conserves in statistical processes, several requirements have to get involved.
By no coincidence, the requirements are almost exactly the same as those we
listed for the invariance of distribution functions: In the entire statistical process
the grand density ρ has to keep continuous and the external forces, which are
associated with Φ in (11), must be completely free from the dissipative nature
and stochastic nature. As has been shown, these requirements cannot be gen-
erally fulﬁlled for realistic statistical systems. All these tell us that Liouville’s
theorem should be regarded as a theory in classical mechanics only.

In summary, this letter has revealed that seemingly simple ﬂuids may actu-
ally be beyond the scope of the existing ﬂuid mechanics and beyond the scope
of the existing kinetic theory.

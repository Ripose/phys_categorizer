The Rate of Expansion of Spherical Flames

V. Karlin∗ and G. Sivashinsky†

Abstract

In this paper we investigate the acceleration of the expansion of pre-
mixed spherical ﬂames and evolution of the cellular patterns on their sur-
faces. An asymptotic model is used for the simulations and a spectral numer-
ical algorithm is employed to study ﬂames over large time intervals. Numer-
ous numerical experiments indicate that for large enough time intervals the
acceleration of two-dimensional expanding ﬂame ceases and the expansion
rate stabilizes to a value signiﬁcantly exceeding the burning rate. The impor-
tance of the effect of forcing was also conﬁrmed and the validity of sectorial
simulations of closed ﬂames was studied in order to justify prospective use
of the Fourier spectral model for the three-dimensional spherical ﬂames.

Introduction

In [1] extensive experimental data on premixed expanding spherical ﬂames have
been analysed and it was concluded that starting from a certain moment the av-
eraged ﬂame radius < r > grows as < r > ∝ t3/2 rather than < r > ∝ t. The
phenomenon was linked to the cellularization of ﬂames, which was well known
from experiments too. Indeed, the appearance of cellular patterns increases the
ﬂame surface area, hence the fuel consumption, and hence the averaged ﬂame
expansion rate.

The cellularization of ﬂame fronts was, in its turn, associated with intrinsic
combustion instabilities. The effect of the hydrodynamic combustion instability
on expanding spherical ﬂames was studied in [2] using the linear perturbation
theory combined with phenomenological assumptions. Later, the approach was
further improved and freed from the phenomenological assumptions [3]. These
linearized solutions conﬁrmed the onset of the instability of the ﬂame front but
could not quantify its cellularization and acceleration because the latter phenom-
ena are essentially nonlinear.

A simple, yet physically reasonable, nonlinear model of hydrodynamically
unstable planar ﬂames was suggested in [4]. In [5] it was extended to expanding
spherical ﬂames and studied numerically conﬁrming that there is a time instance
t∗, such that the ﬂame expansion rate behaves like <r> ∝ t3/2 for t > t∗. The
same model was also suggested in [6], where similar to the planar ﬂames [7],
analytical pole solutions were obtained and studied as well.

Because of their physical origins simple nonlinear models of expanding ﬂames
[5, 6] are expected to be valid only locally. Apparently, the results obtained when
applying them to the whole ﬂame are instructive indeed, but still inconclusive and
cannot be accepted as the adequate theoretical model of cellularization and accel-
eration. A physically consistent global model of ﬂames of any smooth enough
geometry was developed in [8]. Mathematically, the approach projects the gov-
erning equations to the ﬂame surface reducing the mathematical dimension of the
problem by one. However, the resulting equation is still extremely costly from
the computational point of view and only two-dimensional simulations have been
carried out so far.

A compromise between universality and computability was suggested in [9],
where consideration was limited to a narrow but still very practical case of ﬂames
which do not deviate from the spherical ones signiﬁcantly. On the technical side
the model combines the operator of the linearized problem obtained in [2] for
the expanding spherical ﬂame in terms of spherical harmonics expansions and a
Huygens type nonlinearity speciﬁc to the local nonlinear model [5, 6]. Physically,
model [9] is consistent with [8] and is robust and plausible enough to simulate
the cellularization of expanding spherical ﬂames in three spatial dimensions. At
the time of writing of this paper, the ﬂame sizes we were able to reach in our
computations do not signiﬁcantly exceed those reported in [9] and are not large
enough to match our two-dimensional calculations. However, our investigations
show that numerical studies of the expanding three-dimensional ﬂames on the
time scales required for comparison with the two-dimensional calculations are
possible.

In the following sections we specify the mathematical models and numerical
algorithms to solve them. In Section 4 we report our results on ﬂame front be-
haviour on long time intervals and on the effect of external forcing. Also, we
present our attempts to simulate the three-dimensional ﬂames and assess the pos-
sibility of simulation of closed ﬂames via their ﬁnite segments.

2 Mathematical Models

Let us consider an expanding ﬂame front and assume that its surface is close
enough to a sphere and that every point on the ﬂame surface is uniquely deﬁned

2

by its distance r = r(θ, φ, t) from the origin for 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, 0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π, and
t > 0. It is convenient to represent such a ﬂame as a perturbation Φ(θ, φ, t) of a
spherical surface of a reference radius r0(t), i.e. r(θ, φ, t) = r0(t) + Φ(θ, φ, t).
Then, the Fourier image of the governing equation of the ﬂame front evolution in
the nondimensional notations suggested in [5, 6] can be written as

Equation (1) was obtained as a local model of a curved expanding ﬂame. How-

to justify such an action, let us ﬁrst note that if transformed back to the physical
space, the equation takes the form

Comparison of (2) and (7) reveals the detailed relationship between the sim-

of (2) as a global model of the whole spherical ﬂame as long as the perturbations
remain small enough.

Choice of r0(t) in the models introduced in this Section may be based on a

is probably the most appropriate one because it minimizes the perturbations r(t)−
r0(t) = Φ(φ, t). On the other hand, equation (1), or (2), was obtained as that one,
which governs perturbations of a uniform and steadily expanding spherical ﬂame
r(t) ≡ t. Therefore, choice of

r0(t) ≡ t

(12)

is more reasonable in this case, as this is the solution around which the lineariza-
tion is performed. Equation (1) was already considered with (11) in [5]. Here we
complement the analysis of (1) by considering it with (12).

3 Computational Algorithms

System (1) is solved numerically by neglecting the harmonics of orders higher
than a ﬁnite integer number K > 0. Then, the nonlinearity can be represented
as a circular convolution and evaluated effectively with the FFT. Also, we found
that the stability of the numerical integration scheme suggested in [5] can be im-
proved signiﬁcantly by calculating the contribution from the linear terms in (1)
analytically. Thus, the linear terms, i.e.
the source of physical instability, are
tackled exactly and only the nonlinear ones, with the dumping effect, are approx-
imated. This improvement allowed us to continue the calculations for up to ten
times further in time than in [5].

addition, the stability of the numerical integration scheme was improved by eval-
uating the contribution from the linear terms analytically, as shown above, and the
code was parallelized in order to speed up the computations and to use larger data
sets.

4.1 Saturation on the long time intervals

Typical shapes of the ﬂame fronts governed by (1) over large time intervals are
illustrated in Fig. 1. The graph of [r(φ, t)− < r >]/< r > for t = 7.65 × 104
shows that the wrinkle amplitudes are up to 10% of the averaged ﬂame radius.
The explicit forcing was not applied in this example.

Permanent growth of the size of a spherical ﬂame as it expands prompts studies
of the effect of the size of a planar ﬂame on its propagation speed as the ﬁrst
step towards the understanding of the acceleration mechanism of the expanding
ﬂames. The investigation of the dynamics of planar ﬂames shows that the spatially
averaged ﬂame speed

of a ﬂame size L stops growing and begins to oscillate irregularly around its time
average <<Φt>> for large enough t. A deﬁnite correlation between the size of the
ﬂame and its stabilized spatially averaged propagation speed <<Φt>> was estab-
lished, see e.g. [11]. The effect was explained by proving the high sensitivity of
planar cellular ﬂames to particular types of linear perturbations, see [11–14]. By
continuing calculations reported in [11] for even larger planar ﬂames, we estab-
lished that their propagation speed no longer grows after a certain critical ﬂame

size is reached, see graph on the right of Fig. 2. In this paper we are interested in
extending these ﬁndings for planar propagating ﬂames to the expanding ones. In
particular, we are studying the possibility of a stabilization of the expansion rate
for large enough time intervals, when the ﬂame size grows sufﬁciently large.

approximations (t − t∗)α for the expansion rate of the spherical ﬂame are also

whole considered time interval [2.2 × 103, 7.65 × 104] the optimal α ≈ 0.34. For
earlier times t ∈ [2.2×103, 2.0×104], the best approximation is with α ≈ 0.47, i.e.
almost 1/2 as obtained in experiments. However, as time goes by, the expansion
rate slows down and for t ∈ [3.0 × 104, 7.65 × 104] we got α ≈ 0.23.

Markers on the right graph show the calculated cases.

A tendency towards stabilization of <Φt> to a constant for t → ∞ is evident
in the graph too. A change in morphology of the ﬂame front at ts ≈ 2.5 ×
104 is even more obvious in the graph of the variation of the perturbation of the
averaged circular ﬂame relatively to the radius of this averaged ﬂame, i.e. of
max

[r(φ, t)−<r>]/<r>, which is shown on the left of Fig. 3.

The number of cells per unit length of the averaged ﬂame contour is depicted
on the right of Fig. 3. It stabilizes to a cell size of about 200, which is exactly
the same as for large enough planar ﬂames. Eventually, Fig. 4 illustrates the
spectral distribution of energy of the perturbation Φ(φ, t), which stabilizes by ts ≈
2.5 × 104 too.

Stabilization of the averaged perturbation gradient ∇Φ = ∂Φ/∂φ can also be
seen on the left of Fig. 5. Besides the saturation of the gradient the graph illus-
trates the importance of the number of Fourier modes K involved in the numerical
simulation. The jumps in the graph correspond to the instances when we doubled
K in order to match the continuously increasing size of the ﬂame. The graph is

According to the data obtained in numerical simulations we may summarize
the mechanism of ﬂame front expansion in the Fourier space as follows. The
energy of relatively long wave harmonics λ > λcr permanently grows according to
the Darrieus-Landau instability. This gained energy is transferred towards shorter
wavelengths via the nonlinear effects and dissipates through the modes of short
enough wavelengths λ < λcr. As ﬂame expands the number of short enough
angular modes reduces and the overall dissipation rate may become insufﬁcient
to counterbalance the generation of energy due to the Darrieus-Landau instability.
This results in an accumulation of energy in the short wavelength spectrum, see
Fig. 5 (right), and leads to the blow-up of the numerical solution if the number K
of used harmonics is not increased in time. This effect explains a slight elevation
of the short wave tail of the spectral energy distribution on the right of Fig. 4
in comparison to the graph on the left. The latter one corresponds to the time
moment soon after K was doubled, though the former one is just approaching the
moment when K needs to be increased.

In general, the process of stabilization of the expanding spherical front to a
saturated state is very similar to the planar ﬂame. The only distinctive difference
is that the transitional period for the expanding ﬂame is much longer. Using the
realistic set of dimensional parameters from [5], e.g. planar ﬂame speed relative to
the burnt gases ub = 0.5 m/sec and thermal diffusivity Dth = 2.5 ×10−5 m2/sec,
one may interpret our ﬁndings in dimensional terms as follows. First cusps begin
to appear on the ﬂame surface for <r> ≈ 0.1 m; ﬂame acceleration with the rate
<r> ∝ t3/2 starts for <r> ≈ 0.4 m; acceleration rate begins to slow down for
<r> ≈ 5 m, and the acceleration ceases for <r> ≈ 20 m. Most of experiments
summarized in [1] and reported in more recent works [15, 16] were carried out
in enclosures and were affected by essential pressure rise and acoustics. Thus,
there might be a considerable discrepancy between the characteristic ﬂame radii
just reported and those measured in realistic combustion experiments. Eventually,
of course there is a chance that the stabilization of the expansion rate is just a
consequence of the perturbative nature of the governing model used in this work.

4.2 Effect of forcing

A random point-wise set of perturbations uniformly distributed in time and in the
Fourier space is a suitable model for both the computational round-off errors and
a variety of perturbations of physical origins. In general, such a model would look
like

f (x, t) =

am cos(ξmφ + ϕm)δ(t − tm),

(31)

M (t)

m=1
X

11

where am, tm, ξm, and ϕm are non-correlated random sequences. It is assumed
that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ · · · ≤ tm ≤ · · · ≤ tM (t) ≤ t, 0 ≤ ϕm ≤ 2π, and ξm ≥ 0,
m = 1, 2, . . . , M(t). However, in practice we use only two harmonics with ξ =
ξ∗ = ﬂoor [γ <r>/2] and ξ = ξ∗ + 1 weighted according to their closeness to the
critical wavenumber ξcr = γ <r>/2:

f (x, t) ≈ f0[(1 − ξcr + ξ∗) cos ξ∗φ + (ξcr − ξ∗) cos(ξ∗ + 1)φ]

δ(t − tm). (32)

m=0
X

These two harmonics approximate the critical planar ﬂame harmonic of the wave-
length λcr = 4π/γ, which was shown to contribute the most in the fastest growing
perturbations in the Sivashinsky-type models of ﬂame dynamics, see [17].

The sign of the noise amplitude f0 in (32) was either plus or minus for every
m with the probability 1/2. The delta function δ(t − tm) was approximated by
(πτ )−1/2e−(t−tm)2/τ with a small enough value of τ . The impulse-like noise (32)
is used here for the sake of simplicity. Some arguments towards its validity were
suggested in [18]. Validation of models like (31), (32) and of the present numer-
ical approach was carried out in [17]. More sophisticated and physically realistic
models of temporal noise characteristics can be used with (1) as well.

The importance of the effect of the amplitude of noise and frequency of ap-
pearance of the impulse-like perturbations on the ﬂame speed is illustrated in Fig.

4.3 Three-dimensional numerical experiments

In order to integrate (8)-(10) we used an algorithm which is very similar to that
one developed in [9]. In addition, we parallelized the algorithm and used a few
techniques to improve its stability and accuracy, see [19].

The basis functions in the spherical harmonics transformation (SHT) are the
orthonormal eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator in spherical coordinates. How-
ever, unlike the Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), the discrete SHT of a data
set is its approximation rather than an equivalent representation. Namely, it links
a full matrix with N 2 elements representing a function on a regular spherical mesh
of N 2 nodes in physical space and a triangular matrix of N 2/2 spherical harmon-
ics coefﬁcients. Thus, every back/forward cycle results in loss of information.
This loss is similar to the effect of a short wave ﬁlter. In our approach it is associ-
ated with the nonlinear term only.

Coordinate singularities at the sphere poles result in accumulation of approx-
imation errors near the poles and weaken numerical stability. In order to prevent
accumulation of approximation errors near the poles, we rotate the coordinate sys-
tem around an axis in the equatorial plane by an angle ω from time to time. The
coordinate transformation formulas for such an axis passing through the points
φ = ±π/2 are

cos θ′ = cos θ cos ω + sin θ sin ω cos φ
cot φ′ = cot φ cos ω − csc φ sin ω cot θ

Their structure precludes use of the addition theorem for spherical polynomials to
Φn,m to the new coordinate system without the global
transform the coefﬁcients
SHT back to the physical space. On the other hand, the back/forward SHT entails
the application of a short wave ﬁlter to the whole solution
Φn,m, rather than just to
e
Nn,m. Hence, these rotations should not be done too frequently.
the nonlinear term
Also, it is useful to combine them with rotations around the axis passing through
the poles. Implementation of the latter ones is trivial.

Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallelization paradigm was implemented
to allow the computational work to be distributed to a number of processors. How-
ever, the distributed data needs to be exchanged between these processors, which
creates the biggest problem in modelling dynamics of large radius ﬂames. Un-
like the multidimensional DFT, discrete SHT does not possess a structure of a
tensor product of one-dimensional transformations. Therefore, the data transmis-
sion required by the truly distributed discrete SHT is much more sophisticated and
intensive than just back/forward row/column transposition of the global solution
array required by the DFT, see e.g. [20]. This results in a very fast growth of the
communication overheads when the number of processors increases.

Spherical computational algorithms based on parallel Legendre-Fourier trans-
formations are much less efﬁcient than the standard planar Fourier methods. How-
ever, expanding spherical ﬂames can be successfully simulated by the parallel SFT
method. An example of the evolution of a random three-dimensional perturbation
of a spherical ﬂame is illustrated in Fig. 8.

γ = 0.764.

4.4 Dynamics of curved ﬂame segments

Our numerical experiments showed that long time simulations of the three-dimensional
expanding ﬂames using discrete SHT might be possible on a parallel computer
with large enough physically shared memory. However, there is an alternative
approach based on simulations of the three-dimensional ﬂame segments and fol-
lowing extension to the whole surface by periodicity. In order to validate this idea
we applied it to the two-dimensional ﬂames ﬁrst.

14

Results of two-dimensional numerical simulations of the dynamics of sectors
θ ∈ [0, 2π/θπ] of a spherical ﬂame are illustrated in Fig. 9. One may see that
the narrowing of the sector does not affect the ﬂame expansion rate in absence of
explicit forcing and that a correlation between this rate and the size of the segment
becomes apparent as forcing strengthens. Similar observations were obtained for
other parameters discussed earlier in this Section.

Our calculations also show that there is a critical value of θπ above which sec-
torial simulations no longer represent the whole spherical ﬂame. For example, we
would not present the results of our simulations with θπ = 16 as an approximation
for the whole spherical ﬂame. However, based on our two-dimensional results, it
looks like simulations of the three-dimensional spherical ﬂames using the Fourier,
rather than the Fourier-Legendre, spectral model of the Sivashinsky type in the
sector 0 ≤ θ, φ ≤ π, or even in 0 ≤ θ, φ ≤ π/2, are safe.

5 Conclusions

Long time interval simulations of a simpliﬁed model of the expanding spherical
ﬂames indicated that their expansion rate slows down as the ﬂame size grows. The
saturation of the planar ﬂame propagation speed as their size grows was estab-
lished too. Hence, a hypothesis of stabilization of the spherical ﬂame expansion
rate over a ﬁnite time interval is proposed.

Further similarities with the propagating planar ﬂames achieved by the ex-
panding spherical ﬂames on large time intervals were established in the studies
of the effect of forcing, revealing a clear correlation between the strength of the
forcing and the ﬂame expansion rate. This supports the idea that the acceleration
of both planar and expanding ﬂames results from explicit and/or implicit forcing,
which is always present both in experiments and calculations at least as noise of
various physical origins.

15

In spite of many beneﬁts of the simpliﬁed ﬂame dynamics models, they have
not been constructed to cope with signiﬁcant perturbations of spherical ﬂames.
This casts a reasonable doubt in the possibility of extending the effects observed
In order to verify the hypothesis,
for the simpliﬁed model to realistic ﬂames.
numerical simulations of a more sophisticated model are required. In particular,
model [8] is valid for ﬂames of any geometry if thermal gas expansion due to
combustion does not generate signiﬁcant vorticity, i.e. for γ ≪ 1. However, even
in the coordinate form (3)-(6) the governing equation of model [8] is extremely
difﬁcult to solve numerically, because, in contrast to (2), its nonlocal term has no
convolution structure.

Using parallelized spherical harmonics transformation, the evolution of a three-
dimensional expanding spherical ﬂame has been successfully simulated to a stage
when wrinkles appear and form a well developed cellular structure. However,
computational problems associated with the spherical harmonics transformation
make it difﬁcult to extend these calculations on time intervals which would match
those attained in our two-dimensional simulations. On the other hand, it was also
noticed that the simulations of the three-dimensional spherical ﬂames using the
Fourier, rather than the Fourier-Legendre, spectral model of the Sivashinsky type
in the sector 0 ≤ θ, φ ≤ π, or even in 0 ≤ θ, φ ≤ π/2, are reasonable.

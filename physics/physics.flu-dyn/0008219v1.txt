Abstract

We study laminar thin ﬁlm ﬂows with large distortions in the free surface using the
method of averaging across the ﬂow. Two concrete problems are studied: the circular
hydraulic jump and the ﬂow down an inclined plane. For the circular hydraulic jump
our method is able to handle an internal eddy and separated ﬂow. Assuming a variable
radial velocity proﬁle like in Karman-Pohlhausen’s method, we obtain a system of
two ordinary diﬀerential equations for stationary states that can smoothly go through
the jump where previous studies encountered a singularity. Solutions of the system
are in good agreement with experiments. For the ﬂow down an inclined plane we
take a similar approach and derive a simple model in which the velocity proﬁle is not
restricted to a parabolic or self-similar form. Two types of solutions with large surface
distortions are found: solitary, kink-like propagating fronts, obtained when the ﬂow
rate is suddenly changed, and stationary jumps, obtained, e.g., behind a sluice gate.
We then include time-dependence in the model to study stability of these waves. This
allows us to distinguish between sub- and supercritical ﬂows by calculating dispersion
relations for wavelengths of the order of the width of the layer.

1 Introduction

In this paper we develop a simple quantitative method to describe ﬂows with a free surface
which can undergo large distortions. Our method is capable of handling ﬂows whose velocity
proﬁle may become far from parabolic — even including separation and regions of reverse
ﬂow. We are concerned with the case when the ﬂuid layer is thin. For low Reynolds number
ﬂows the lubrication approximation can be used with great success (see e.g.
[15]). For
high Reynolds number ﬂows without separation an inviscid approximation and the shallow
water equations [43] are widely used. For moderate Reynolds numbers where these limiting
approximations are invalid it is important to take both inertial and viscous eﬀects into
account in a consistent way, and yet one would like to keep the model simple enough to
be tractable. In this paper we show that integral methods, like the ones developed by von
Karman, can handle a class of such problems successfully. To be concrete we develop the
method in the context of two physical examples: the circular hydraulic jump and the ﬂow
down an inclined plane. Both geometries support jump- or kink-like solutions with abrupt
changes in the surface shape and internal velocity proﬁles. Analytical solutions for such
ﬂows are extremely diﬃcult to obtain, and simple approximate theories that capture the
phenomena are invaluable.

The two ﬂows are studied in separate sections, and an introduction is provided in the
beginning of Secs. 2 and 3, respectively.
In Sec. 2 we develop the theory for the circular
hydraulic jump. We ﬁrst study the boundary layer approximation to the full Navier-Stokes
equations, and reduce it to a simple set of equations by averaging over the thickness. Sta-
tionary solutions are obtained by solving a two-point boundary value problem for a system of
only two ordinary diﬀerential equations. The solution is compared to previous experiments,
showing good agreement. Taking advantage of the simplicity of the reduced equations, it
is possible to obtain analytic approximations for the stationary solution. Two “outer” so-
lutions connected by an “inner” transition region are studied separately and we obtain a
relationship analogous to the shock condition in the classical shock theory, but within our
viscous model.

The ﬂow down an inclined plane is then studied in Sec. 3. We use the same strategy
as in Sec. 2 to derive a simple model for the two-dimensional ﬂow. One family of solutions
found in this model is kink-like traveling wave solutions that occur, e.g., when the ﬂow rate
is suddenly changed. Their velocity proﬁles along the inclined plane are found to stay close
to parabolic even when a variable proﬁle is assumed. There is another family of solutions
with a sudden change in the surface that would correspond to the circular hydraulic jump in
case of the radial geometry. These solutions can be interpreted as the stationary hydraulic
jump, created behind a sluice gate in a river, even though turbulence is not included in the
model. The ﬂow downstream of the jump approaches a simple stationary ﬂow, but the ﬂow
upstream is an expanding ﬂow with a linear growth in thickness. The velocity proﬁle departs
considerably from parabolic near the jump.

It is not easy to analyze the stability of the solutions with jumps obtained in Secs. 2
and 3, even in the linear geometry. Instead, in Sec. 4, we include time-dependence in the

2

models and study the dispersion relation for the stationary ﬂow with constant thickness. A
well-established concept in the inviscid theory is to classify ﬂows as super- and subcritical
when the thickness is small and large, respectively. They do not have obvious counterparts,
however, when viscosity is included. By looking carefully at the dispersion relation in the
long and medium wave regime, we can classify the stationary ﬂows into these two categories
in our viscous model. The model shows spurious divergencies in the short wavelength region
which we do not know how to overcome at present. This makes the model unsuited for
direct time-dependent simulations. A short paper describing some of the main results has
appeared earlier [8].

Introduction to the problem

When a jet of ﬂuid hits a ﬂat horizontal surface, the ﬂuid spreads out radially in a thin,
rapidly ﬂowing layer. At a certain distance from the jet a sudden thickening of the ﬂow
takes place, which is called the circular hydraulic jump. This is commonly seen, e.g., in the
kitchen sink, but it is also important as a coating ﬂow and in jet-cooling of a heated surface
[29]. In these practical ﬂows with typically high Reynolds numbers, disturbances often make
the jump non-stationary and distorted. In controlled laboratory experiments corresponding
to a more moderate Reynolds number, an apparently stationary, radially-symmetric ﬂow can
be achieved. Such experiments was carried out by C. Ellegaard et al. and the results have
been published elsewhere [6, 7, 16, 17, 30]. We thank them for providing us with data and
pictures. A schematic view and a video image of the circular jump are shown in Fig. 1.

In these experiments the hydraulic jump is formed on a ﬂat disc with a circular rim.
The rim height d can be varied, and is an important control parameter. Since the rim is
located far from the impinging jet with the diameter of the disc around 36cm, it does not
aﬀect the jump except that it changes the height of the ﬂuid layer hext exterior to the jump.
The jump still forms even when d = 0, but a larger d makes hext larger and, therefore, the
jump stronger. Typically, hext exceeds d by 1-2mm. The surface proﬁles for varying d are
shown in Fig. 2. An interesting transition in the ﬂow structure has been observed [6, 7] as
d is varied. For d = 0, it was noticed before [40, 14, 23, 32, 33] that the jump contains an
eddy on the bottom, called a separation bubble, whose inner edge is located very close to the
position of the abrupt change on the surface, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a). Such a hydraulic
jump is referred to as a type I jump. While d remains small, this jump is stable, but as d
is increased further, a wave-breaking transition occurs [6, 7] which results in a new state of
the ﬂow. In this type II state, the ﬂow has an additional eddy, called a roller or a surﬁng

height d is controlled but not shown.) The height h(r) approaches hext for large values of r.
Parameters are: the ﬂow rate Q = 27[mℓ/s] and viscosity ν = 7.6×10−6[m2/s], corresponding
to the characteristic scales: radius r∗ = 2.8[cm], height h∗ = 1.4[mm], and radial velocity
u∗ = 12[cm/s]. Figure taken from [6].

small hysteresis.

wave, just under the surface as shown in Fig. 3(b).1 This state resembles a broken wave in
the ocean, but is still apparently laminar. On reducing d, the type I pattern reappears, and
there is almost no hysteresis associated with this transition. The transition from type I to
II often leads also to breaking of the radial symmetry. An intriguing set of polygonal jumps
[16, 17] are created rather than the circular one. In this paper we shall concentrate on the
type I ﬂow which already poses considerable diﬃculties. We hope to be able to generalize
our approach in the future to be able to handle the transition to the type II ﬂow.

Considering how simple and common the circular hydraulic jump appears to be, it is
surprising that a satisfactory systematic theory does not exist. The approach considered as
“the standard” for the study of hydraulic jumps is to combine the inviscid shallow water
equation with Rayleigh’s shocks [13]. In the beginning of the century Lord Rayleigh treated
[37] a discontinuity in a one-dimensional linear ﬂow geometry. Such a structure is usually
called a river bore if it is moving and a hydraulic jump if it is stationary and is created due
to, e.g., variations in the river bed. His approach was based upon the analogy between the

shallow water theory and gas theory [43]. He assumed that, across such a shock, the mass
and momentum ﬂux are conserved but not the energy ﬂux.

In a coordinate system moving with the shock, the ﬂow velocity v1 and height h1 upstream
of the jump as well as v2 and h2 downstream of the jump are taken to be positive constant
values. Then, conservation of mass ﬂux Q across the jump is given by

v1h1 = v2h2 = Q.

where F1 = qv2

1/gh1 = (hc/h1)3/2 is the upstream Froude number, F2 = qv2

(hc/h2)3/2 the downstream Froude number, and

2/gh2 =

hc = (Q2/g)1/3

(4)

is called the critical height. It is easy to see that hc is always between h1 and h2, and that
F1 > 1 > F2 if h1 < hc < h2, and F1 < 1 < F2 if h1 > hc > h2. In other words the jump
connects a supercritical ﬂow with F > 1 on the shallower side (h < hc) to a subcritical ﬂow
with F < 1 on the deeper side (h > hc). Since the Froude number measures the ratio of the
ﬂuid velocity v and the velocity of linear surface waves √gh, it means that, in the moving
frame, the ﬂow moves more rapidly than the surface waves on the shallower side, but moves
slower on the deeper side — in a precise analogy with the gas theory [43, 39]. Further, it is
found that the upstream h1 must be supercritical by considering the change in the energy
ﬂux across the jump [43]:

Qe2 − Qe1 = −

gQ(h2 − h1)3

8πh1h2

(5)

where Qe denotes the energy ﬂux. Since the energy must be dissipated through the jump,
i.e. Qe2 − Qe1 < 0, rather than generated, it is required that h1 < h2. The origin of the
dissipation is usually attributed to the turbulent motions at the discontinuity and surface
waves carrying energy away from it.

It is possible to apply this theory, combined with an assumption of the potential ﬂow,
for describing the circular hydraulic jump. However, it leads to incorrect estimates [42, 5]
of the radius of the jump Rj. Most notably, Rj is predicted to be sensitive to the radius of
the impinging jet which should be greatly inﬂuenced by radius and height of the inlet nozzle
where liquid comes out. In experiments [42, 5] such a strong tendency was not observed.
Instead, it has been found that Rj scales with the ﬂow rate Q with a certain power, and

6

it supports a model in which viscosity plays an important role. Watson [42] constructed
a model of the ﬂow consisting of the inviscid and viscid regimes, and solved the viscid
part assuming a similarity proﬁle. By connecting to the speciﬁed external height hext via a
Rayleigh shock, he obtained a prediction for the radius of the jump which compares favorably
with the measurement [42, 5], as we explain in Sec. 2.5. In his model the viscous layer starts
from the stagnation point at r = 0 on the plate and quickly reaches the surface at a small r.
There is a fairly long stretch from this r to Rj in which the ﬂow is fully viscous.2 Thus, one
could neglect the inviscid region and assume a fully viscid ﬂow everywhere in order to derive
a simpler model. This assumption was made by Kurihara [25] and Tani [40] who started
from the boundary layer equations developed by Prandtl [34, 38]. They took an average of
the equations over the thickness, assuming also a similarity velocity proﬁle. It resulted in
a single ordinary diﬀerential equation for the stationary jump. This theory was elaborated
in [5] who realized that the ﬂow outside the jump would naturally lead to a singularity at a
large r. By identifying this singularity with the outﬂow over the rim of the plate, the ﬂow
outside the jump could be uniquely speciﬁed. By introducing a Rayleigh shock, the jump
radius and its parameter dependence was calculated and compared to measurements. The
model predicted the observed Rj reasonably well, as we review in Secs. 2.2–2.5.

Obviously, treating the jump as a discontinuity provides us with no information on the
internal structure of the jump region such as the type I to II transition of the ﬂow patterns.
It also seems inconsistent to assume a Rayleigh shock when viscous loss occurs in the whole
domain. Why do we assume an extra energy loss at the “jump” where the ﬂow is stationary
and apparently laminar? It seems possible to attribute the energy dissipation entirely to
laminar viscous forces, and to construct a viscous theory which produces a smooth but kink-
like surface shape without the need for a discontinuity. Nevertheless, such a description must
overcome a diﬃculty arising from the Goldstein-type singularity [19, 26] of the boundary
layer equations in the vicinity of separation points. This singularity is thought to be an
artiﬁcial one created by truncation of higher derivatives from the Navier-Stokes equations.
It also arises in the “usual” boundary layer situation where a high Reynolds number ﬂow
passes a body, e.g., a wing. In such cases inviscid-viscid interaction is taken into account
in order to resolve the singularity in a technique called the inverse method [10].
In our
situation, however, there is no inviscid ﬂow outside the layer. In Secs. 2.6–2.7 we propose a
way to resolve the trouble in the following manner. We ﬁrst include an additional degree of
freedom in the velocity proﬁle to make it non-self-similar, just like in the Karman-Pohlhausen
method [20] for the usual boundary layer theory. To describe the evolution, in r, of this free
parameter, we couple the layer thickness to the pressure by assuming hydrostatic pressure.
This serves as an alternative to the inverse method in the absence of a potential external
ﬂow. The resulting model for a stationary solution is two coupled ordinary diﬀerential
equations, and reproduces the type I ﬂow with a separation bubble — the one shown in
Fig. 3(a). Comparison with the experiment is made in Sec. 2.7. It is possible to approximate

2 This assumption is conﬁrmed by recent laser-doppler measurements of the velocity proﬁle before the
jump [30]. Thus, the assumption made by [18, 4, 9] that the jump occurs at the point where the growing
viscous layer touches the surface and the ﬂow becomes fully developed, is incorrect.

analytically the stationary solution found in the model. In Sec. 2.8 the analysis is presented
separately for the regions before and after the jump (i.e. two “outer” solutions) and the
“inner” solution inside the jump region. An interesting observation on the inner solution is
that a formal parameter µ can be introduced so that Rayleigh’s shock condition is recovered
in the limit µ → 0.

2.2 The full model

We write down the complete model to describe the circular hydraulic jump under the assump-
tion that the ﬂow is laminar and radially symmetric without any angular velocity component.
We take the radial and vertical coordinates ˜r and ˜z, and denote the velocity components by
˜u and ˜w, respectively.3 The governing equations are the continuity equation

˜u˜r +

where subscripts denote partial diﬀerentiations such as ˜u˜t = ∂ ˜u/∂˜t. For the boundary
conditions we impose no-slip on the bottom:

˜u(˜z = 0) = ˜w(˜z = 0) = 0.

where σ is the coeﬃcient of surface tension and ˜k is the mean local curvature of the free
surface. We also need to satisfy the kinematic boundary condition on the free surface:

˜h˜t + ˜u˜h˜r = ˜w

on ˜z = ˜h(˜t, ˜r).

(10)

We are mostly interested in stationary solutions in this section. When the ﬂow is stationary,
we may integrate (6) over ˜z from 0 to ˜h, and use (10) to obtain

expressed by the same symbols but without tildes. In ﬁgures, however, we do not use tildes for simplicity.

2.3 Boundary layer approximation

Since it is a formidable task to treat the full model as it stands, some simpliﬁcations need to
be made. As explained in Sec. 1, the Reynolds number for the ﬂow of the circular hydraulic
jump is too large to justify the lubrication approximation, but is not large enough to use the
inviscid approximation. Fortunately, the ﬂow is “thin,” i.e. runs predominantly horizontally
along the plate. Truncation of the full model by the boundary layer approximation is quite
natural in such a situation, and has indeed been used in previous literature [25, 40, 5]. In the
boundary layer approximation pressure, viscous, and inertial terms in (7) are all assumed to
be of the same order, but there are only a few dominant terms in each group. For instance,
a viscous term ν ˜u˜r˜r is assumed to be negligible compared to ν ˜u˜z ˜z. The dominant terms in
the ﬁrst equation in (7) are determined in the usual manner: ˜u˜t (if time-dependent), inertia
terms ˜u˜u˜r and ˜w˜u˜z, the pressure term ˜p˜r/ρ, and the dominant viscous term ν ˜u˜z ˜z. Similarly,
from the second equation in (7) we assume the dominant balance between ˜p˜z/ρ and g. Here,
unlike the usual boundary layer theory, we have taken into account the eﬀect of gravity.
This will couple the surface height h to the pressure, and will later turn out to be crucial for
removing the singularities of the boundary layer approximation.

If we denote the characteristic radius and height by r∗ and z∗, respectively, then the
second dominant balance requires the characteristic pressure to be ρgz∗. Then, the ﬁrst
balance relation requires

where u∗ and w∗ are typical radial and vertical velocities, respectively, and t∗ is the charac-
teristic time scale. The mass ﬂux relation (11) requires that

u∗r∗z∗ = q.

while the continuity equation (6) requires

u∗
r∗

.

Solving (12), (13), and (14) uniquely determines the characteristic scales:

r∗ = (q5ν −3g−1)1/8 ≃ 2.7[cm],
z∗ = (qνg−1)1/4 ≃ 1.5[mm],
u∗ = (qνg3)1/8 ≃ 12[cm/s],
w∗ = (q−1ν3g)1/4 ≃ 6.7[mm/s],
t∗ = (qν −1g−1)1/2 ≃ 0.22[s]

(13)

(14)

(15)

where the estimated values correspond to a typical set of parameters used in the experiments:
ν ≃ 0.1 cm2/s (for mixture of ethylene-glycol and water) and Q ≃ 30 cm3/s, i.e., q ≃ 5
cm3/s. The values for r∗ and z∗ correspond well to a typical jump radius and ﬂuid thickness

9

in the experiments. Also, the predicted scaling can be experimentally tested by, for instance,
measuring the dependence of the jump radius by changing the parameters such as q. In [5]
evidence of the scaling and validity of the underlying assumption was given.

We now use the characteristic scales (15), together with the pressure scale p∗ = ρu2

∗, to

non-dimensionalize the full equations. From (7), we obtain

r2(cid:19)
ut + uur + wuz = −pr + uzz + ǫ2(cid:18)urr +

(17)

Since ǫ = z∗/r∗ = 0.05 for the typical parameter values above, the assumption that the ﬂow
is “thin” is well satisﬁed, and we shall drop the terms of order ǫ2 and higher in the equations
(16). We also focus on stationary solutions in the rest of the section, and thus we obtain the
simpliﬁed equations of motion:

uur + wuz = −pr + uzz
0 = −pz − 1.

(18)

Correspondingly, within the error of O(ǫ2), the dynamic boundary conditions (9) are just

p|z=h = W hrr
uz|z=h = 0.

Here we have introduced the Weber number

(20)

where ℓ = (2σ/(gρ))1/2 is the capillary length. For the parameter values above together with
σ ∼ 70[dyn/cm] (maximum), we estimate that W ∼ 0.01 and ℓ ∼ 3.8[mm]. Since W is
small, we neglect it in the study of stationary states.4,5 The second equation of (18) and the
ﬁrst condition of (19) with W set to zero yield hydrostatic pressure:

p(r, z) = h(r) − z.

Combining (18) and (21), we obtain the stationary boundary layer equations:

uur + wuz = −h′ + uzz,

4 However, the term inﬂuences dispersion of short waves, so should be included in the stability analysis

of stationary states, possibly together with the neglected terms of O(ǫ2) and higher in (18).

outlet is much higher, but it becomes moderate near the jump.

dimensionless continuity equation:

ur +

and mass ﬂux condition:

rZ h(r)

0

u(r, z)dz = 1.

The boundary conditions have been reduced to:

u(r, 0) = w(r, 0) = 0
uz|z=h(r) = 0.

(23)

(24)

(25)

In addition to these conditions, boundary conditions in the radial direction also need to be
speciﬁed. We do not elaborate on them, however, since the in- and outlet conditions arise
naturally without the need for prescription when we obtain a simpliﬁed system.

The boundary layer equations (22)–(25) form a closed system and can be solved numer-
ically, but pose a diﬃculty when separated regions exist. Suppose that there is a separation
point at r = rs and z = 0 on a ﬂat plate where the skin friction uz vanishes. In its vicin-
ity one ﬁnds [38] that generic solutions of (22) develop singularities of the Goldstein-type

u ∼ √rs − r, w ∼ 1/√rs − r. On the other hand, experiments [6] show separation and

reversed ﬂow just behind a jump, so it is necessary to overcome this diﬃculty, which is well-
known in the “usual” boundary layers around a body immersed in a high Reynolds number
external ﬂow. No such singularities are observed in numerics of the full Navier-Stokes equa-
tions in that case, and thus the trouble is thought to be due to truncation of the terms
involving higher derivatives in r, i.e. the terms in (16) of the order O(ǫ2) and higher. An
attempt to include those terms leads to intractable equations, so the inverse method [10] is
often used. In this method the feedback from the boundary layer into the external potential
ﬂow is taken into account, and the coupled system is iteratively solved to remove the singu-
larity. Without such an external ﬂow present for the circular hydraulic jump, Higuera [22]
has still obtained the velocity and height proﬁles from the boundary layer equations. His
method, called marginal separation, is to force the boundary layer equations through the
point of separation by choosing a special non-divergent velocity proﬁle at the point. The
physical reasoning for the choice of such a particular proﬁle is rather unclear. Since our aim
is also to obtain a simple tractable model, we have chosen a diﬀerent approach.

2.4 Averaged equations

Rather than solving the partial diﬀerential equation (22) itself, we shall be content with
satisfying only the mass and momentum conservation laws, derived from averaging (22) over
the transverse z-direction. To do this we make an ansatz for the radial velocity proﬁle u. One
might expect that the singularities at separation points do not contribute to the averages
and do not cause any harm. Such an expectation is too naive as shown in the next section,

11

since the model still shows singular behavior near the jump if the simplest velocity proﬁle is
assumed. Nevertheless, we show in Sec. 2.7 that the model becomes capable of going through
the jump smoothly once enough ﬂexibility is introduced in the assumed proﬁle.

We ﬁrst deﬁne the average velocity at r by

v =

u(r, z)dz.

The total mass ﬂux condition (24) can be written as

rhv = 1.

(26)

(27)

Next, for each ﬁxed r, we integrate the radial momentum equation (22) over z from 0 to
h(r), and use the continuity equation (23) with the surface boundary conditions (25). We
obtain the averaged momentum equation

Equations (27) and (30) are the total mass and momentum equations.

2.5 Similarity proﬁle for u

The simplest assumption for the radial velocity proﬁle is a self-similar ansatz:

u(r, z)/v(r) = f (η)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

where η = z/h(r) takes values between 0 (bottom) and 1 (surface). Using (23), the
ansatz can be rewritten in the alternate form: w(r, z) = ηh′u(r, z).
It is also equivalent
to the requirement that the local inclination of the streamlines at (r, z) be proportional to
ηh′ = zh′(r)/h(r). Clearly, such an ansatz is too simple and “rigid” to describe a ﬂow
with separation. However, this is the assumption used in the previous literature, and we
summarize its consequences. For more details, see [5].

The conditions (25) and (27) now imply

f (0) = 0,
f ′(1) = 0,

Z 1

0

f (η)dη = 1.

12

(32)

They are not suﬃcient to uniquely determine f , and we choose one that is physically reason-
able. Thus, a parabolic proﬁle f (η) = 3η − 3/2η2 is a simple candidate. Using this choice,
G = 6/5 is a constant from (29), and (30) becomes

6

vv′ = −h′ −

3v
h2 .

(33)

Other choices for f lead to the same equation with diﬀerent numerical coeﬃcients. Since all
such equations, corresponding to diﬀerent choices of f (η), can be further transformed to

vv′ = −h′ −

v
h2

(34)

by suitably including numerical coeﬃcients in the characteristic scales (15), the choice of f
is not important in the study of qualitative behaviour and of parameter dependence.

Using (27), the equation reduces to a single ordinary diﬀerential equation for v(r):

v′(cid:18)v −

1

v2r(cid:19) =

1
vr2 − v3r2.

(35)

This Kurihara-Tani equation was derived and studied in [40], in its dimensional form, and
in [5]. The results can be summarized as follows. To ﬁnd a solution corresponding to a
hydraulic jump, the velocity v should be large for small r, and decrease smoothly as r
increases. However, the model does not have such a solution. The coeﬃcient of v′ on the left
hand side generically vanishes at some r where v′ diverges. If (35) is solved in a parametric
form on the (r, v)-plane, all solutions spiral around and into the ﬁxed point (r, v) = (1, 1),
that is a stable focus in the plane. Therefore, one must still connect solutions in the interior
and the exterior by means of, e.g., a Rayleigh shock across which mass and momentum ﬂux
are conserved. When this is carried out, one ﬁnds that the shock occurs very close to r = 1
in the dimensionless coordinates, implying that the radius of the jump in the dimensional
coordinates scales roughly as r∗ in (15), i.e.:

Rj ∝ (cid:16)q5ν −3g−1(cid:17)1/8

.

(36)

This scaling relation (36) was compared to experiments [5, 21] by changing q for several
diﬀerent ν. The radius of the jump indeed scaled with the mass ﬂux q, but the exponent
observed in the experiment was about 3/4 rather than 5/8 suggested by (36). To explain
the discrepancy, Rj was calculated more accurately [5].
It was ﬁrst proven that there is
no solution for v(r) to the Kurihara-Tani equation that extends to r = ∞. All solutions
were found to diverge at some r = rend (constant) like h ∼ {log(rend/r)}1/4. By identifying
this singularity as the end of the plate where the water runs oﬀ, one may always ﬁnd the
solution of (35) diverging at the end of the plate of a given radius r = rend. By following the
solution to smaller r, the solution before the jump and the position of the shock are uniquely
determined assuming a connection via a Rayleigh shock. The shock location constructed in
this way showed a good agreement [5, 21] with the experiment.

2.6 Proﬁle with a shape parameter

An ansatz more ﬂexible than (31) must be used for resolving the ﬂow pattern in the vicinity
of the jump. We shall allow the function f in (31) to depend also on r. The simplest modiﬁ-
cation we can make is to assume f = f (η, λ(r)) so that the velocity proﬁle is characterized by
a single “shape parameter” λ(r). The approach follows the ideas developed by von Karman
and Pohlhausen [38] for the usual boundary layer ﬂow around a body. There, separation of
the boundary layer can occur when the pressure gradient, imposed by the external inviscid
ﬂow, becomes adverse. In our case, there is no external ﬂow, but there is a pressure gradient,
along the bottom z = 0, that is proportional to h′(r) due to the hydrostatic pressure (21).
Thus, the possibility arises that the ﬂow separates on z = 0 near the jump where h′ is large
and pressure is increasing in r, as in the usual boundary layer ﬂow.

As an improvement over the parabolic proﬁle, we approximate the velocity proﬁle by the

cubic:

u(r, z)/v(r) = aη + bη2 + cη3,

(37)

where a, b, c are now functions of r. Due to the boundary condition (25) and mass ﬂux
condition (27), the coeﬃcients a, b, and c can be expressed in terms of one parameter λ as,
for example:

a = λ + 3,

b = −(5λ + 3)/2,

c = 4λ/3.

The separation condition

uz|z=0 = 0

(38)

(39)

is now equivalent to a = 0, or λ = −3. The u-proﬁle is parabolic when c = 0, or λ = 0.
Now that we have two unknowns h(r) and λ(r), two equations are necessary. We use the
averaged momentum equation (30) as the ﬁrst equation. Note that G is now not a constant,
but depends on the shape parameter λ. From (29), we obtain

G(λ) =

6
5 −

λ
15

+

λ2
105

.

(40)

Following the Karman-Pohlhausen choice, we choose the second equation to be the momen-
tum equation (22) evaluated at z = 0:

h′ = uzz|z=0 .

(41)

This connects the pressure gradient on z = 0 with λ. Using (38) and (40), the two equations
(30) and (41) can be written as

d
dr {G(λ)v} = −h′ −
v
h′ = −

14

(42)

which can be simpliﬁed to

(G(λ)v)′ =

4λ
h2
5λ + 3

h′ = −v

h2

.

(43)

Finally, eliminating v using (27), we obtain a nonautonomous system of two ordinary diﬀer-
ential equations for h(r) and λ(r):

h′ = −

λ′ =

(44)

This is the model for the stationary circular hydraulic jump. It does become singular, but
only on the lines h = 0 and λ = 7/2 which does not cause any trouble in describing a ﬂow
with a separated zone (λ < −3). We show in the next section that the highly simpliﬁed
model indeed contains solutions which describe the observed circular hydraulic jumps. A
similar approach using momentum and energy conservation was used in [1], but they did not
succeed in ﬁnding continuous solutions through the jump.

2.7 Numerical solution of the integrated model

The model (44) can be solved as a boundary value problem by specifying two boundary
conditions for diﬀerent values of r. Thus we impose

(r1, h1(r1)) and (r2, h2(r2)),

r1 < r2

(45)

where the values are taken from the measured surface height data. There is no ﬁtting
parameter once they are chosen, and the function h(r) and the shape parameter λ(r) are
determined. In particular, we do not need to specify the shape parameter as a part of the
boundary conditions. This is an advantage of the simpliﬁed model since one no longer needs
to specify the velocity proﬁle at the inlet and/or outlet boundaries, which is not easy to do.
In fact, we see that specifying both h and λ at one r, either inside the jump or outside, and
solving (44) as an initial value problem is unstable. The system is extremely sensitive to the
initial condition if one integrates (44) in the direction of increasing r from a small r or in the
direction of decreasing r from a large r. Therefore, we choose r1 and r2 near 1, typically r1
around 0.4-0.8 and r2 around 1.2-1.6. Then, a straightforward shooting method from either
boundary is suﬃcient to obtain a solution. After this is achieved, the solution is extended to
r < r1 and to r > r2 by integrating (44) backward from r1 and forward from r2, respectively.
Integrations in these directions are stable.

Figure 4(a) shows two solutions of such a boundary value problem. They correspond
to the two type I solutions in Fig. 2, reproduced here as dot-dashed curves. From each
curve the boundary data are taken at ˜r1 = 11.8[mm] (corresponding to dimensionless value
r1 = 0.42) and ˜r2 = 30.0[mm] (to r2 = 1.07). The computed solutions h(r) corresponding

are shown as the dot-dashed curves. Numerical solutions of the model (43) are shown as
solid curves in both panels, and show reasonable agreement. To obtain each of the numerical
solutions, h values were read from the experimental data at r = 11.8[mm] and r = 30.0[mm],
then a boundary value problem was solved by the shooting method. The thick dashed
curve represents an analytical approximation of the solutions before the jump, described in
Sec.2.8.1. The formula (52) and (53) shows good agreement with one ﬁtting parameter. (b)

analytical approximation. (c) Two trajectories of (43) are shown in the (h, λ)-plane. They

to the data are shown in solid curves. Each curve shows a gradual decrease for small ˜r as
˜r increases, reaches a minimum at some ˜r ≈ 15[mm], and then undergoes a sharp jump at
˜r ≈ 22- 23[mm], and a slow decay after the jump. The location of the jump is about 10% oﬀ
in each case, and the slope behind the jump is noticeably diﬀerent. However, the qualitative
behavior is well captured by the simple model. Figure 4(b) shows the shape parameter λ.
The velocity proﬁle changes suddenly almost simultaneously with the rapid increase of the
surface height, and a region where λ < −3, corresponding to separation, is observed in each
case.6 The parameter λ(r) recovers and appears to converge to λ = 0 (the parabolic proﬁle)
as r becomes large.

The ﬂow structure is more directly shown in Fig. 5, where the u-velocity proﬁles are
computed from λ at equidistant locations in r. Since magnitudes of the velocity vary a lot
between small and large r, the proﬁles are scaled by the average velocity, so that the proﬁles
6 If the downstream height is further reduced, however, the shape parameter λ does not reach λ = −3,
and there is no separated region. Thus, our model predicts that a (weaker) jump without an eddy is possible.
The ﬂow near the bottom still decelerates just after the jump.

Figure 5: Visualization of the type I ﬂow pattern based on the computed shape parameter
λ(r) from the model. The velocity proﬁles at equidistant locations in r are the horizontal
component u, thus they are not tangential to the streamlines. Since magnitudes of the
velocity vary greatly between small and large r, the proﬁles of u(r, z)/v(r) are shown. The
streamlines separate zones which carry 10% of the ﬂow rate. A separation bubble is present
in the range of r where λ < −3. Note the diﬀerence in the scales for the axes. The parameters
diﬀer from those of Fig. 4. They are: Q = 33[mℓ/s] and ν = 1.4× 10−5[m2/s], corresponding
to r∗ = 2.5[cm], z∗ = 1.7[mm], and u∗ = 16[cm/s].

of u(r, z)/v(r) are shown. The stream function ψ is computed from the deﬁnition

u = ψz/r

, w = −ψr/r.

(46)

The dimensionless stream function varies from ψ = 0 on z = 0 to ψ = 1 on z = h. Inside
the separated region ψ < 0. The contours at ψ = −0.1, 0, 0.1 . . . , 1 are shown in the ﬁgure.
That is, a region between two neighboring contour curves carries 10% of the mass ﬂux.
The surface velocity U predicted from the model is shown in Fig. 6. The parameters are
the ones used in Fig. 5. The model again misses the location of the jump by about 20%,
so measurements and the curve from the model are oﬀset, but qualitative features are well
reproduced. The velocity outside the jump is small and decays like U ∝ 1/r, as can be seen
from the log-log plot in the inset. This is consistent with an almost constant h and a nearly
parabolic velocity proﬁle, which we analytically demonstrate in the next section. On the
other hand, the surface velocity decreases almost linearly before the jump. This region is
harder to explain intuitively, but an analytical approximation is also obtained in the next
section. At the jump a rapid, cusp-like drop in the velocity is noticed.

Finally, we discuss the dependence of the solutions on the external height hext. Both in
experiments and in the model the height inside the jump is little aﬀected by the change in

Marker particles and a high-speed camera were used in order to obtain the surface velocity U
shown as dots. The theoretical dotted curve was computed by ﬁnding a stationary solution
h(r) and λ(r) of a boundary value problem using two data points taken from the measured
surface proﬁle (not shown). Although the location of the jump is about 20% oﬀ, the model
reproduces qualitative feature of the measurement very well. At small r, the velocity drops
rapidly and almost linearly. It then shows a cusp-like drop at the jump, and decays gradually
for large r. The ﬁnal decay is proportional to 1/r as can be seen from the slope of about −1
in the log-log plot of the exterior region (inset).

the external boundary condition h2(r2). The numerical solutions as well as the measured
surface proﬁles in Fig. 4(a,b) apparently overlap in the interior to the jump. Of course, the
two solutions must correspond to diﬀerent trajectories of the model (43) and cannot collapse
exactly onto a single curve. However, the closeness of the solution curves in the interior to
the jump is the cause of the diﬃculty of solving the initial value problem starting from a
small r.

If the external height is further increased, a transition from type I to II is observed in
the experiment, as illustrated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Unfortunately, no such transition is
reproduced in the model when h2 is increased. Instead, one ﬁnds a computed solution of
the model similar to the ones in Fig. 4 even for a much larger h2. A physical mechanism
to “break” the wave into a type II ﬂow appears to be missing. In fact, a solution with a
roller is prohibited by the model (43). The surface velocity on a roller is negative (inward).
According to (38), the velocity at the surface is

U = v(a + b + c) = v

9 − λ

3

,

(47)

where v > 0 is the average velocity. Thus, U < 0 iﬀ λ > 9. However, since we start with
λ ≃ 0 and the line λ = 7/2 makes (43) singular, a solution with a roller is not possible. It

18

seems likely that this behavior can be traced back to the assumed pressure distribution (21)
which does not provide any pressure gradient along the surface z = h. In a recent simulation
of the circular hydraulic jump by Yokoi et al.[41] pressure buildup just behind the jump
is observed and claimed to be crucial in breaking the jump. The non-hydrostatic pressure
arises partly due to the surface tension in (19.1), but also due to the truncated viscous terms
in (18) and (19). We do not know at present how best to extend our model to include the
type II ﬂows.

2.8 Asymptotic analysis of the averaged system

In this section we approximate the solutions of (43) analytically using formal perturbation
expansions. We obtain explicit expressions for two “outer” regions: the region before the
jump and the one after the jump. Moreover, we derive a single ordinary diﬀerential equation
for the “inner” region near the jump. Analysis in the inner region connects a previous model
using a Rayleigh shock with our model.

2.8.1 Outer solution 1 (before the jump)

First, we analyse the region before the jump where thickness of the ﬂuid as well as the
radius are small, compared to the exterior region. We denote the typical thickness, in the
dimensionless coordinates, as θ, and treat it as a formal small parameter. We rescale the
variables into H, R, and V as

h = θH,
r = θαR,
v = θ−1−αV,

(48)

and require consistent balance of the terms in (44) or, equivalently, (43). The rescaling for v
in the third equation of (48), is chosen to ensure mass conservation (27) for all θ. In terms
of the new variables, (43) can be written as

θ−2α−1 d
dR
θ1−αH ′ = −θ−α−3V

(G(λ)V ) = θ−2 4λ

5λ + 3

(49)

From the ﬁrst equation the only consistent choice is to take α = 1/2. Then, in order to
balance the power of θ on both sides of the second equation, we need

λ = −3/5 + θ4λ1 + . . . .

(50)
The form is also motivated by Fig. 4 in which λ stays close to the value −0.6 before the
jump.
To ﬁnd H(R) and the correction λ1, substitute (50) into the ﬁrst equation of (49). To

the lowest order in θ we obtain

(53)

We test the approximations (52) and (53) in Fig. (4). The dashed curves are the theoretical
curves of H(R) and λ(R), shown in the dimensional coordinates. They match the numerical
solutions and the measurements well before the jump. Here, the formal parameter θ is taken
as unity, and the one free parameter C1 was ﬁtted to be 0.25.

2.8.2 Outer solution 2 (after the jump)

Let us now consider the behavior of (43) for large r. We again introduce a formal small
parameter θ, but we now rescale r = θ−1R. If we moreover assume that the height is of
order 1, i.e., h = H, then the rescaling of the velocity is necessarily v = θV due to (24).
Using these new variables, Eqs. (43) become:

In order to balance the terms in the ﬁrst equation we choose

λ = θ2λ1 + . . . .

(54)

(55)

This is again consistent with the bottom panel of Fig. 4 where λ apparently tends to 0,
corresponding to the parabolic proﬁle. Then, the terms of order unity in the second equation
are

(56)

where Rend is an integration constant representing the radius where the height goes to 0.
Thus, (43), as well as the simpler Kurihara-Tani model (33), becomes singular when r → ∞.
This seems to be a general property of models based on the boundary layer equations [5].
The absence of regular solutions for the system (22)-(25) when r → ∞ was proved in [36].
We have attributed this lack of asymptotic solutions to the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite size of the
plate. Indeed, a solution with vanishing height such as (57) reminds one very much of a ﬂow
running oﬀ the edge of a circular plate.

The height H(R), given by equation (57), is a very slowly varying function of R. There is
a long regime 1 ≪ R ≪ Rend where the height appears almost constant. In this intermediate
regime the leading order of (54.1) becomes

We conclude that λ(R) ∝ 1/R2 → 0 which explains the observed approach to the parabolic
velocity proﬁle for large r.

2.8.3 Inner solution near the jump: conservation of momentum

Finally, we analyze the region around the hydraulic jump. Recall that in the Kurihara-Tani
theory (33) the jump was obtained by ﬁtting a Rayleigh shock. In this section, we show that
our model (44) is a natural generalization of the equation.

To do this we return to (42), and introduce a formal parameter µ in the left-hand side

of the second equation.

dr {G(λ)v} = −h′ −

µh′ = −
rh3 (5λ + 3).

v
h2 (λ + 3)

(60)

where v = 1/(rh). The ﬁrst equation describes the balance of inertia, hydrostatic pressure,
and viscous forces. The value µ = 1 corresponds to (42).

Setting µ = 0 gives λ = −0.6. Then the ﬁrst equation becomes the Kurihara-Tani
equation (33), except that the coeﬃcient 6/5 = 1.2 is changed to G(−0.6) ≈ 1.243 here, since
the proﬁle is not parabolic. (As discussed before, the velocity proﬁle is not so important in
their model as long as it is self-similar.) Since our model corresponds to µ = 1, the parameter
µ interpolates between the two models, but the correspondence of the two is not obvious
because the limit µ = 0 is a singular limit. We treat µ as a formal small parameter, and
carry out a singular perturbation analysis to investigate the connection as well as to obtain
an approximation in the jump region.

21

In Kurihara-Tani model a shock is needed to extend the solution from small to large
values of r. Suppose the shock is situated at r = r0. Consider a small region of size µ around
r = r0, and rescale the coordinate as r = r0 + µX. Then, in the inner coordinate X, Eq. (60)
becomes

We see that λ = −0.6 with h an arbitrary constant are the only possible ﬁxed points of
(61). Thus the solutions must satisfy λ → −0.6 for X → ±∞. This correctly matches the
external solution before the jump, but not after the jump, where λ → 0.7 The ﬁrst equation
can be integrated once, giving the momentum conservation.

with an integration constant C3. Now we solve the second equation of (61) for λ, and
substitute it into this equation. Using (40) in the form G(λ) = 1

an ordinary diﬀerential equation for h only:

h1 and h2 are constants. Then, Eq. (63) with the ﬁrst boundary condition determines the

It is easy to see that hc is always between h1 and h2, i.e., h1 < hc < h2 or h2 < hc < h1. The
Froude number in this case could naturally be deﬁned as F (X)2 = (hc/h(X))3.9

When h1 is close to hc, the ﬁnal height h2 is close to hc as well. Then, the Froude number
is close to unity for all X, and the jump is weak, i.e. hc − h1 = δ ≪ 1. Then, we see from
the balance of the terms in (64) that h = hc + δY (δx). The leading balance reduces to

Y ′ = γ(1 − Y 2)

with

γ =

Thus, in the weak jump limit, the height is given by

h(x) = hc + δ tanh(δγx).

(68)

(69)

It is interesting to note that we can connect from h1 at X = −∞ to h2 at X = +∞ if
h1 < h2, but not if h1 > h2, just like in the Rayleigh shock. This requirement comes from
the equation (64) self-consistently rather than making a hypothesis on the energy loss like
we did in (5). To see this, consider the stability of the ﬁxed points h1 and h2 with respect to
the governing equation (64) for h.10 Linearizing (64) around the uniform solutions hi (where
i = 1, 2), we obtain an equation for the perturbation δhi in the height:

If h1 < hc < h2, then K1 > 0 > K2, showing that the ﬁxed point h = h1 is unstable and
h = h2 stable. A trajectory departing from h1 at X = −∞ and arriving at h2 at X = +∞

height (4) that appeared in the Rayleigh shock, apart from the numerical factor and the inﬂuence of ˜r0
reﬂecting the radial geometry. The viscosity ν only enters in the coeﬃcient of dh/dX in the dimensional
version of (64), thus does not aﬀect ˜hc.

8 In dimensional variables, the critical height is ˜hc = (G(−0.6)q2/g˜r2

9 However, it is not clear whether F deﬁned in this way can be a measure of super- and subcriticality
since the governing equations are not the shallow water equations and therefore propagation of disturbances
do not obey the well-known velocity √gh.

10Of course, this stability analysis is to study existence of stationary solutions, and not to study the

stability of such solutions in the time-dependent theory.

is not prohibited, and we can indeed ﬁnd such a trajectory shown in Fig. 7. In contrast, if
h1 > hc > h2, then the stability of the ﬁxed points is reversed, and there is no trajectory
going from h1 to h2.

When h1 < hc < h2 so that such a trajectory exists, the departure from h1 is generally
rapid, giving an impression of a “sharp corner” at the beginning of the jump, and the arrival
at h2 is much smoother just as shown in Fig. 7. This is because the magnitude of the stability
coeﬃcient K1 is large compared to that of K2. The feature is most pronounced when h1 is
small (so, h2 is large). It vanishes as (h2 − h1) → 0 when K1 and K2 both tend to zero.
In Fig. 7 we compare solutions of (64) with the two solutions of the full numerical solution
of (43) shown in Fig. 4. The jump region is enlarged. Solutions of (64), shown as solid curves,
are computed by ﬁtting the values for h1 and h2, and solving the equation using r0 obtained
from (65) and (66). We chose an initial condition to be somewhere inside the jump, and
integrated (64) forward and backward from it. Since (64) has a translational invariance with
respect to X, the initial condition ﬁxes the location of the jump without aﬀecting the shapes
of h or λ. The analysis assuming µ → 0 performs surprisingly well against the numerical
solution for µ = 1. The size of the jump region is now of order µ, i.e., unity, and the internal
structure is non-trivial. The single ordinary equation (64) is capable of describing the eddy
formation in this region.

3 Flow down an inclined plane

3.1

Introduction to the problem

The properties of waves running down an inclined plane is a subject of great theoretical and
practical importance, and has attracted the attention of many researchers. Starting with
the pioneering work of Kapitsa & Kapitsa [24], some of the major contributions to this ﬁeld
are found in [2, 3, 31, 35, 11, 12, 28, 27] . The physical picture is the following. A ﬁxed ﬂux
of ﬂuid is constantly poured onto the inclined plane from above. The ﬂuid forms a stream
moving downwards under the action of gravity – an idealized model of a river. If the inﬂux
of ﬂuid upstream is suddenly increased, it causes the height upstream to increase, and the
extra mass of ﬂuid to propagate downstream. In a river, this may be caused by the melting
of snow at regions neighbouring the river’s source, or by sudden rain. A river bore, on the
other hand, is introduced at the mouth of the river by a tidal wave, for instance, and moves
upstream. In both cases, a solitary wave can be formed, moving at a constant velocity c
without changing its shape.

We are particularly interested in kink-like solitary wave solutions going from one constant
height h1 to another h2. One can identify such a solution with a heteroclinic orbit, connecting
two stationary states [35]. The speed c depends on how much the ﬂuid level is increased,
i.e., the heights h1 and h2. Alternatively, we can consider c as a parameter, and study the
existence of the stationary solution h ≡ const. depending on c. It is rather straightforward to
see that two solutions with h ≡ h1 and h ≡ h2 exist if c is suﬃciently large. However, even if
c is in that regime, it is hard to judge whether there exists a smooth solution connecting the
two states. Based on the method of averaging in Sec. 2, we develop a simple model which
helps us to derive criteria for their existence and to compute the wave form. The model also
enables us to ask whether they appear as “Rayleigh shocks” in the sense that the ﬂow is
supercritical in front of the kink structure and subcritical behind it. As we shall elaborate,
the distinction between super- and subcritical ﬂows is a concept inherent in inviscid shallow
water theory, and is not at all obvious for a viscous ﬂow since now the waves will show
dispersion as well as damping. Indeed, we ﬁnd that the wave velocities corresponding to the
largest wave lengths will always propagate both forward and backwards, as in a subcritical
ﬂow. Nevertheless, if we focus on wavelengths of the order of the depth of the ﬂuid layer, a
clear distinction can be made.

There is another kind of ﬂow in the linear geometry in which a sudden thickening of
height is observed. This solution is not only relevant for, e.g., the ﬂow of water exiting from
a sluice but is also a direct analog of the circular hydraulic jump. The ﬂow streams rapidly in
a region immediately after the sluice, and then abruptly slows down at a certain downstream
position. It is stationary (i.e. c = 0) with a constant discharge, and is not obtained as a
state connecting two “equilibrium” heights. In fact, the rapid ﬂow before the jump cannot
be extended arbitrarily far upstream. We shall show that our models provide physically
reasonable solutions in this case, too.

In Secs. 3.2 and 3.3 we write down the complete system for the inclined plane problem,

25

non-dimensionalize it, simplify it using the boundary layer approximation, and average over
the thickness in two ways. These steps are in parallel with those in Sec. 2, but we go through
them brieﬂy not only for completeness but also since the geometry and the characteristic
scales are diﬀerent. To seek stationary and traveling wave solutions, we write the equations
in a coordinate frame moving at a constant speed in Sec. 3.4. Traveling waves are studied
in detail in Sec. 3.5, and the stationary jumps in Sec. 3.6.

3.2 The governing equations

We consider a viscous, incompressible, two-dimensional ﬂow. The coordinate system is
˜x in the downstream direction parallel to the inclined plane, and ˜y in the perpendicular
direction above the plate. Denote the velocities in these directions by ˜u(˜x, ˜y, ˜t) and ˜w(˜x, ˜y, ˜t),
respectively, the pressure by ˜p(˜x, ˜y, ˜t), and the height by ˜h(˜x, ˜t). The governing equations
for this problem are the continuity equation

˜u˜x + ˜w˜y = 0

and the Navier-Stokes equations

1
˜u˜t + ˜u˜u˜x + ˜w˜u˜y = −
˜p˜x + g sin α + ν (˜u˜x˜x + ˜u˜y ˜y)

˜w˜t + ˜u ˜w˜x + ˜w ˜w˜y = −
ρ

˜p˜y − g cos α + ν ( ˜w˜x˜x + ˜w˜y ˜y)

(71)

(72)

Here, α is the angle of the inclined plane (between 0 and π/2) measured downward from the
horizontal line, and the subscripts denote the partial derivatives as before. The boundary
conditions are identical to those of the radial geometry, i.e., (8)–(10), by reading ˜r as ˜x and
˜z as ˜y. The local mass ﬂux is:

˜q(˜x, ˜t) = Z

0

˜h(˜x,˜t)

˜ud˜y.

Integrating the continuity equation (71) in ˜y over the thickness and using the boundary
conditions, we obtain the ﬂux conservation equation:

˜h˜t + ˜q˜x = 0.

(73)

The equations above form a complete system apart from the inlet and outlet conditions. They
possess a trivial stationary solution (Nusselt solution) with a constant ˜h and the parabolic
velocity proﬁle:

˜u(˜x, ˜y, ˜t) ≡

g sin α

 η −

η2

2 ! ,

(74)

where η = ˜y/˜h. Given this equilibrium ﬂow, the local ﬂux ˜q is also uniform and steady, and
is a function of ˜h:

˜h

˜q = Z

0

˜ud˜y =

g˜h3 sin α

3ν

.

26

(75)

In a non-equilibrium ﬂow we assume that the inclined plane is inﬁnitely long, and the
ﬂow suﬃciently far downstream approaches this equilibrium ﬂow. We then treat the ﬂow
rate ˜q for ˜x → ∞ as the characteristic mass ﬂux q∗. The corresponding height ˜h using
(75) is used as the length scale h∗, and v∗ = q∗/h∗ becomes the characteristic velocity.
We non-dimensionalize the governing equations by these scales. The continuity equation is
unchanged in form:

ux + wy = 0,

and the Navier-Stokes equations become

3.3 Boundary layer equations and averaged models

Since the ﬂow on the inclined plane is expected to be predominantly in the x-direction, the
boundary layer approximation should be applicable [11, 12] as long as separation does not
occur. In a similar manner as the radial case, the dominant terms of (77) are:

(83)

From (81.2) and (82), the pressure is hydrostatic with contribution from the surface tension:

p(x, y, t) =

R tan α

(h(x, t) − y) + W hxx

so, (81.1) becomes

The mass conservation (73) is non- dimensionalized to

ht + (hv)x = 0.

(84)

(85)

(86)

Now, we make an ansatz for the u-proﬁle, and average over the thickness in order to

obtain two simpliﬁed models. First, we use the self-similar velocity proﬁle:

u(x, y, t)/v(x, t) = f (η)

where η = y/h(x, t) and the function f (η) satisﬁes

f (0) = 0
f ′(1) = 0

Z 1

0

f (η)dη = 1.

f 2(η)dη

is a constant for a given proﬁle in this model. We shall use G = 6/5 for concreteness,
corresponding to the parabolic proﬁle f = 3(η − η2/2). Equation (89) is the Cartesian
analogue of the Kurihara-Tani equation (33), with time-dependent and surface tension terms.
Next, we assume a variable one-parameter proﬁle for u. As before, we use a third-order

polynomial

u(x, y, t) = v(x, t)(aη + bη2 + cη3)

(90)

with a = λ + 3, b = −(5λ + 3)/2, and c = 4λ/3 chosen to satisfy the conditions (88) for
f . The shape parameter λ(x, t) is the single variable characterizing the velocity proﬁle. To

28

describe the evolution of λ(x, t) and h(x, t) we choose the same set of equations as in the
circular hydraulic jump. The ﬁrst equation is the mass ﬂux equation (86). In addition, we
use the momentum equation (85) multiplied by h and averaged in y, and also (85) evaluated
at y = 0:

(92)

In the following we call (89) with (86) the “similarity model”11 and (92) with (86) the
“one-parameter model”. Both models inherit the trivial uniform solution from the complete
Navier-Stokes model: h = v = q ≡ 1, and λ ≡ 0 (parabolic proﬁle) for the one-parameter
model.

3.4 Stationary solutions in a moving coordinate frame

Here, we are concerned with either stationary solutions or traveling waves whose surface
proﬁles may show abrupt changes. Both types of solutions can be sought as stationary
solutions in a moving coordinate system with a suitable constant velocity c, including the
possibility c = 0. Thus, we use the traveling wave coordinate ξ = x − ct, and rewrite the
models within this frame.

Using the chain rule, the mass conservation (86) used in both models becomes

−chξ + (hv)ξ = 0

which can be integrated to

− ch + hv ≡ Q(const.)

(93)

where Q is the mass ﬂux, viewed in the moving frame.12 The ﬂow must approach the uniform
equilibrium ﬂow h = 1 in the ξ → ∞ limit. Suppose it also approaches another equilibrium
ﬂow h = h2 in the ξ → −∞ limit. Then, using (80), the condition becomes

− ch2 + h3

2 = Q = −c + 1.

(94)

Of course, h2 = 1 is a solution of this equation. In this case we might still be able to ﬁnd a
non-trivial solution of a pulse-like solitary wave form. Such solutions have previously been

11 The similarity model is the “Shkadov model” considered in [11, 12] when W 6= 0.
12 Note that the ﬂux q(x, t) in the laboratory frame is, in general, not a constant. The discharge at the

inlet, e.g., at x = −∞ must be varied in time accordingly.

29

studied well [11, 12], and we do not further seek this type of solutions. For a solution of (94)
other than h2 = 1, we need

c = h2

2 + h2 + 1.

The solution that can be positive is

h2 = −1 + √4c − 3

2

which is positive if and only if c > 1.

(95)

When c > 1 two diﬀerent equilibrium solutions exist, and we hope to ﬁnd a kink-like
solution which connects the two limiting ﬂows. However c > 1 is only the necessary condition
for its existence. Suﬃciency for the existence depends on the models and the parameters: R,
α, and c. In Sec. 3.5 we shall clarify the parameter regime for ﬁnding such solutions. It turns
out that the velocity proﬁles in this type of solutions do not deviate much from parabolic
even in the one-parameter model. In this sense they correspond to somewhat “mild” jumps
in terms of the ﬂow structure.

In Sec. 3.6 we ﬁnd another family of solutions which approaches h = 1 as ξ → ∞ when
c < 1. These solutions do not start from an equilibrium state at ξ = −∞. Instead, they are
only valid for ξ larger than some value ξ0. In the similarity model they are not interesting
since they approach h = 1 smoothly. However, within the one-parameter model, an abrupt
change is developed in both the surface and velocity proﬁles, sometimes with separation. We
interpret this solution, when c = 0, as the analogue of the circular hydraulic jump in the
Cartesian geometry.

The presence of surface tension makes the order of the equations higher and makes it
more diﬃcult to compute the solutions even when they exist. We assume that W is small and
negligible, and set W = 0 in this section. Under this assumption we convert the averaged
models into the moving coordinate frame at velocity c. Equation (89) in the similarity model
becomes:

(97)

(98)

to be solved with (93). One variable, for instance v, can be eliminated so that the system
becomes two-dimensional for h and λ.

30

In the following sections we treat these averaged models as “dynamical systems”, and
view ξ as a time-like variable. Fixed points of these systems correspond to the uniform,
equilibrium solutions of the original time-dependent equations. Note that stability in terms of
the variable ξ is not equivalent to temporal stability of the original time-dependent equations.

3.5 Traveling wave solutions

Due to the relationship (95) which is a one-to-one map between c and h2 in the range c > 1,
we may treat h2 or c as the primary parameter interchangeably. Using h2 as a parameter
corresponds physically to varying the height and discharge upstream and then observing the
corresponding change in the wave velocity. The condition c > 1 is equivalent to h2 > 0, and
h2 > 1 if c > 3. The two regimes h2 > 1 and h2 < 1 are qualitatively diﬀerent. For h2 > 1
the discharge at ξ → −∞ is increased, and a forward-facing front travels downstream. As we
shall see in this section, this state exists for small enough R. In contrast, h2 < 1 corresponds
to a backward-facing front which is found to exist for large enough R but seems to us very
likely unstable. Thus, we concentrate on the case h2 > 1 in the following.13

3.5.1 The similarity model

Since (97) is a ﬁrst order autonomous ordinary diﬀerential equation, the necessary condition
for the existence of a heteroclinic orbit starting from h2(> 1) and arriving at h = 1 is that
the ﬁxed point h = 1 is stable and h2 is unstable. By linearization, the ﬁxed point h = 1 is
found to be stable if

c2 − 6(1 − c)2 + 15/(R tan α) > 0

R tan α <

where the denominator is positive for c > 3. Similarly, h2 is found to be unstable if

2 + 10h2 + 5 ≡ f2(h2).

The denominator of f2 vanishes only at h2 = hmax
2 ≈ 2.13 for the region h2 > 1. If h2 > hmax
,
then f2 < 0 and (101) cannot be satisﬁed. We discard this region of h2. For 1 < h2 < hmax
one ﬁnds that f2(h2) > 1 > f1(h2). Thus, the necessary condition for the existence is simply
(100). Once the necessary condition is fulﬁlled, suﬃciency is guaranteed. To see this, we

13 If we used the geometric mean of the up- and downstream heights p˜h1˜h2 as the characteristic length,

we would obtain equations whose symmetric appearance makes it easy to study the forward- and backward-
facing fronts simultaneously. However, we have chosen to scale by the downstream height ˜h1 in order to
treat the traveling waves as well as the stationary jumps.

the region 1 < h < h2. Suppose it vanished at hs, then we would have

s/(R tan α) = 0.

s)/(R tan α) > 0.

It is clear that hs > 1 is impossible. Thus, hs < 1, and there is no vanishing denominator
in 1 < h < h2. In Fig. 8(a) we show computed solutions of (97) for three diﬀerent Reynolds
numbers. The parameters α and h2 are ﬁxed, such that (100) becomes R < 6.95. Within
this range, a larger R makes the propagating front sharper.

32

3.5.2 The one-parameter model

We can eliminate v from (93) and (98), and think of trajectories on the phase portrait for
(h, λ). We look for a heteroclinic orbit starting from a ﬁxed point (h2, 0) and arriving at (1, 0)
as ξ → ∞. It is necessary for its existence that the point (h2, 0) has at least one unstable
direction and (1, 0) has at least one stable direction. Linearizing around the equilibrium
point as h = he + δh and λ = 0 + δλ, where he = 1 or h2, we obtain:

δλξ ! = J   δh
  δhξ

δλ ! .

It is straightforward to calculate the 2 × 2 Jacobian matrix J, and show that

det J =

60(c − 3h2
Rh7
e

e) tan α

.

(103)

For the point (h2, 0) we have c − 3h2
2 < 0 when h2 > 1. This means that
det J < 0 for h2 > 1, and the ﬁxed point is always a saddle, having exactly one unstable
direction.

e = 1 + h2 − 2h2

For the point (1, 0) we have det J > 0 since c − 3h2

e = h2

Thus, we must also compute the trace of J for he = 1 which can be shown to be

2 + h2 − 2 > 0 when h2 > 1.

trJ = −

60
R

+ (33 − 61c + 25c2) tan α.

For the stability of (1, 0) we need trJ < 0. Since 33− 61c + 25c2 > 0 for c > 3, this condition
becomes

R tan α <

−3 − 11h2 + 14h2

2 + 50h3

2 + 25h4

2 ≡ fs(h2).

(104)

When this is satisﬁed, the ﬁxed point is locally attracting, and a trajectory may reach it
from any direction. Indeed, we ﬁnd numerically that the condition (104) also seems to be
suﬃcient. For any R and α we have tried in the range (104), a heteroclinic solution was
found. Computed solutions for three diﬀerent values of R are shown in Fig. 8(b) and (c).
The parameters α and h2 are identical to the ones used for the similarity model in Fig. 8(a).
The condition (104) yields R < 5.59. The height proﬁles in (b) are essentially identical to
the ones in (a). This is because the shape parameter λ shown in (c) does not deviate much
from λ = 0, the parabolic proﬁle.

In Fig. 8(b) and (c), the solution is oscillatory around h = h1 and λ = 0 for R = 5.5.
This is a feature seen when R becomes close to the critical value given by (104). It happens
when the type of the ﬁxed point (1, 0) changes from a stable node to a stable focus. The
point is a focus when det J > (trJ)2/4, which is equivalent to f+(h2) < R tan α < f−(h2)
where

f±(h2) =

−7 − 9h2 + 16h2

and

D = 2 + 3h2 − 9h2

2 − 19h3

2 + 3h4

2 + 15h5

2 + 5h6
2.

It can be seen that f+(h2) < fs(h2) < f−(h2) for h2 > 1. Therefore, a heteroclinic solution
can be found and exhibits oscillations in a small region f+(h2) < R tan α < fs(h2).
In
Fig. 8(b) and (c) this condition corresponds to 4.81 < R < 5.59, so only the solution for
R = 5.5 shows oscillations.

3.6 Stationary jumps

If c < 1, the two averaged models have only one ﬁxed point h = 1. Therefore, one might
imagine that it is too limited to show any jump-like structures. Nevertheless, we look for
trajectories that approach to the ﬁxed point as ξ → ∞. Even though c = 0 is the physically
most interesting case, we treat the general case 0 ≤ c < 1. Since there is no h2, we use c as

3.6.1 The similarity model

The sole ﬁxed point h = 1 must be stable to be the limiting point of a trajectory as ξ → ∞.
For 0 ≤ c < 1, the condition is similar to (99) but with reversed inequality

c2 − 6(1 − c)2 + 15/(R tan α) < 0.

The singular height hs of the governing equation is still given by (102), and, using a similar
argument as before, it is easy to see that 0 ≤ hs < 1 is impossible when c < 1. Thus, there is
a trajectory which approaches h = 1 from below if (106) holds. When 1 > c > (6−√6)/5 ≃
0.71, c2 − 6(1 − c)2 > 0 and (106) cannot be satisﬁed. When c < (6 − √6)/5, the condition

is equivalent to

(106)

(107)

R tan α >

15

6(1 − c)2 − c2 ,

which is satisﬁed in a range of R tan α since the denominator of the right hand side is positive.
Computed solutions for R = 50, 70, and 100 are shown in Fig. 9 as dashed curves using
α = 3[deg] and c = 0. The condition (106) becomes R > 47.7, and is satisﬁed for all three.
Each solution simply approaches h = 1 smoothly, clearly reﬂecting the ﬁrst order nature
of the model (97). As ξ decreases, the height vanishes at a ﬁnite ξ and an inlet must be
placed before this happens. If h is very small, (97) simpliﬁes to dh/dξ = 5/{2R(1− c)}. The
solution is

2.5

R(1 − c)

h(ξ) =

(ξ − ξ0)

(108)

for some ξ = ξ0 where h = 0. There is no abrupt change in the solutions that resembles
a stationary shock structure. If we use R smaller than the critical value, then there is no
solution converging to h = 1. Therefore, we view the similarity model as inadequate for
describing stationary jumps.

Figure 9: Computed stationary solutions for α = 3[deg] and c = 0. Dashed curves are
solutions of the similarity model (97) for R = 50, 70, and 100. Solid curves are solutions of
the one-parameter model (98) for R = 30, 50, and 70. A larger R corresponds to a slower
convergence to the equilibrium ﬂow h = 1. These solutions do not show any shock-like
structure.

3.6.2 The one-parameter model

The sole ﬁxed point of this model when c < 1 is (h, λ) = (1, 0). The Jacobian and its
determinant is still given by (103), but now c − 3h2
e = c − 3 < 0 and, thus, det J < 0.
Therefore, the ﬁxed point is always a saddle in this range of c, and there is one direction
convergent to the ﬁxed point as ξ → ∞. It is easy to compute the corresponding trajectory
by integrating backward in ξ from the vicinity of the ﬁxed point. This solution seems to
exist for all values of R, α and c < 1. We are interested in solutions which approach h = 1
from below, and tend to h = 0 at some ξ = ξ0 as ξ decreases. (To be physical, an inlet
condition must be speciﬁed at some ξ > ξ0.) We can analyze the solutions asymptotically
near ξ0 by assuming that h ∼ A(ξ − ξ0) as ξ → ξ0 + 0. Then, using (93) and Q = 1 − c in
(94), we obtain v ∼ (1 − c)/{A(ξ − ξ0)}. Substituting these into (98.2) yields

λ ∼ −0.6 +

(1 − A cot α)(ξ − ξ0)3.

3A3

5(1 − c)

Finally, comparing coeﬃcients of the dominant terms in (98.1) determines A as

A =

5RG(−0.6)(1 − c) ≈

R(1 − c)

We observe two qualitatively diﬀerent types depending on the parameter values.

If λ
increases at the point ξ = ξ0, then the solution reaches the parabolic proﬁle λ = 0 mono-
tonically. This occurs when R is large, and three computed solutions are shown in Fig. 9
as solid curves. The height proﬁle is qualitatively identical to the ones from the similarity
model shown in dashed curves. They do not show any jump structure.

On the other hand, if λ decreases at ξ0, then the trajectory makes an excursion to smaller
λ, sometimes into the separation zone λ < −3, before recovering toward λ = 0. The condition
to obtain the second type is A cot α > 1, or,

R tan α <

with G(λ) given by (40). Two solutions satisfying this condition are shown in Fig. 10(a) and
(b). Both the height proﬁle and the shape parameter vary in a similar manner to the one we
obtained in the circular hydraulic jump. The phase portrait in (c) demonstrates how rapid
and large the excursion can become for small R. This type of solution could be realized, for
instance, as a stationary ﬂow (c = 0) exiting a sluice gate placed at some ξ > ξ0.14

14 A full-scale channel ﬂow such as a river certainly requires a turbulence modelling, but we have been able
to construct a miniature experimental model in which the ﬂow remains laminar. However, our preliminary
observation is that a pair of edge waves are created from the ends of the gate, which makes the ﬂow three-
dimensional.

4 Linear stability of equilibrium states

It is quite diﬃcult to carry out linear stability analysis around the stationary solutions
and traveling wave solutions found so far. They have non-uniform proﬁles obtained only
numerically and some of the solutions have singular points beyond which they cannot be
continued. Moreover, the inlet boundary condition can strongly aﬀect the stability properties
of the solutions. We shall therefore focus on the linear geometry, and only study stability
of the equilibrium ﬂow h ≡ const. The results are, however, expected to be applicable
to the equilibrium ﬂow suﬃciently far downstream of the jump in the stationary solutions
and to ﬂows suﬃciently up- and downstream of the moving front in case of the traveling
wave solutions. Since the dispersion relation scales with the chosen characteristic length, as
described in Sec. 4.4, we only need to consider the ﬂow h ≡ 1. Both the similarity model (89)
and the one-parameter model (92) are considered, including the surface tension term which
is expected to be relevant [35] for stability. One of our aims is, of course, to judge when
inﬁnitesimal disturbances grow and whey they decay, but their propagation velocities are
also of our great interest. By comparing the velocities to a reference velocity, which is zero
for the stationary jump and c(> 3) for the traveling wave, we are able to classify diﬀerent
parts of the solutions as either super- or subcritical.

4.1 Dispersion relations

The ﬁrst step is to linearize the models around the ﬁxed point h = v = 1 and, for the
one-parameter model, λ = 0. We assume inﬁnitesimal disturbances δh, δv, and δλ, and
decompose them into Fourier modes:

δh, δv, δλ ∼ ei(kx−ωt).

(110)

Plugging them into the linearized equations for the similarity model (86) and (89), we

obtain:

(115)

Note that this model also has only two dispersion relations, ω+(k) and ω−(k) because the
second equation of (92) does not include time-derivatives.

4.2 Long wave limit
We ﬁrst study the long wave limit k → 0 by taking only the lowest order terms in k. For
the similarity model, the dispersion relation (112) becomes

ω+ = 3k + ik2(R − cot α) + O(k3)
ω− = −

k − ik2(R − cot α) + O(k3).

3i
R −

5

(116)

As k → 0, the group velocities dω+/dk → 3 and dω−/dk → (−3/5). Therefore, waves
corresponding to ω− propagate upstream, and the ﬂow is subcritical irrespective of R. By
studying the dominant imaginary components of ω±, we also ﬁnd that the reverse propagating
branch ω− is always stable, i.e. the disturbances decay, for small enough k whereas the
forward propagating branch ω+ is stable only for small enough Reynolds number satisfying

R tan α < 1.

(117)

The limiting dispersion is identical in the one-parameter model apart from numerical

coeﬃcients. For small k, (114) becomes

ω+ = 3k + ik2(

ω− = −

25

R − cot α) + O(k3)
k − ik2(

(118)

Thus, the ﬂow is always subcritical since the long waves in the ω− branch propagate upstream
with velocity −14/25. Again, this branch is stable for any R while the ω+ branch is stable
only for small Reynolds numbers:

R tan α < 4/5.

(119)

4.3

Intermediate range of k

It is quite unexpected that the ﬂow is subcritical for any R. One would intuitively expect
that disturbances cannot propagate upstream for suﬃciently rapid ﬂows. An explanation
can be made by a more careful study of the dispersion relations (112) and (114), or, in
particular, the discriminants D0 and D1.

(b)
One-parameter model using (114) for R = 20, 25, and 30.
In both models α = 5[deg]
and W = 0.01 are ﬁxed. Three dashed and solid curves correspond to the ω+ and ω−
branches, respectively, of the dispersion relation. The ω+ has a positive slope, or group
velocity, for all k, while the ω− branch has positive slope only when R is large. However, for
large enough R, the region of k in which both branches have positive slopes extends from
small k corresponding to wavelengths beyond the system size to large k with wavelengths
smaller than the thickness of the ﬂow. In this case the ﬂow is essentially supercritical since
disturbances are all carried away downstream.

We ﬁrst consider the similarity model.

corresponding group velocities become

Both c+ and c− become positive for

R tan α > 5/2.

(120)

(121)

We attempt to estimate such a range of k. For brevity we assume R tan α ≪ 25/2 so that
the coeﬃcient of k2 in D0 can be approximated by 3/(R tan α). If the magnitude of the
O(k2) dominates in D0, then we must have

(122)

Using R = 30, α = 5[deg], and W = 0.01, for instance, the condition (121) and (122) gives
a window 0.16 ≪ k ≪ 10.7 in which we can hope that the O(k2) term dominates.
Rather than attempting a more accurate estimate of the zone, we demonstrate that such
an interval can be in fact quite long, by plotting the real part of ω±(k) for (112) in Fig. 11(a).

39

Three diﬀerent values of R are used while α and W are ﬁxed. The ω+ branch, shown as
dashed curves, has a positive slope for any k. Both phase and group velocities of this branch
are positive. On the other hand, the ω− branch, shown as solid curves, qualitatively changes
with R. For R = 25 its slope appears to be negative for all k, indicating a subcritical ﬂow.
However, for a larger R there is an interval of k in which the slope becomes positive. In
the limit k → 0, the branch still has a negative slope in accordance with the analysis of the
long wave limit in the previous section. However, the subcritical region near k = 0 can be
very small. One sees in Fig. 11(a) that the curve has a positive slope already when k > 0.05
and R = 35. The slope continues to be positive until k = 2, corresponding to a wavelength
of half the thickness of the equilibrium ﬂow. Since the system length is ﬁnite in practice,
the subcritical ﬂow in the k → 0 limit cannot be achieved, and the ﬂow becomes essentially
supercritical for all the wave numbers observed. This deﬁnes the super- and subcritical ﬂows
within our viscous model, and conﬁrms the intuitive picture of having a supercritical ﬂow
when the ﬂow is suﬃciently rapid.

The situation is qualitatively identical in the one-parameter model. We obtain

R tan α > 20/11

and

as the corresponding equations to (121) and (122), respectively. Again using R = 30,
α = 5[deg], and W = 0.01, the interval becomes 0.05 ≪ k ≪ 0.18. The upper limit
comes from the O(k3) term in D1, and is estimated to be rather small since we have only
compared the magnitudes.
In fact, when we plot the real part of the dispersion relation
(114) in Fig. 11(b), we ﬁnd that the ω− branch has a positive group velocity for a much
longer range of k. The supercritical ﬂow near the k = 0 limit is very small once again if R
becomes as large as R = 25.

4.4 Super- and subcriticality for moving fronts

The intermediate-k behavior enables us to decide whether a given equilibrium ﬂow is “inher-
ently” super- or subcritical. This distinction is made based on wave velocities with respect
to the laboratory frame. A more classical distinction of the two types arises in the context
of the shock theory, as reviewed in Sec. 2.1. In this case velocities are measured with respect
to a moving front; we call the ﬂow “supercritical” if the group velocity of all the waves is
less than the front velocity c, and “subcritical” if there is a wave component whose group
velocity is larger than c. Here, we brieﬂy note that the averaged equations can describe this
traditional classiﬁcation, too.

Take a moving front such as the one shown in Fig. 8. We concentrate on the long wave
limit k → 0. For ξ → ∞ the ﬂow approaches an equilibrium ﬂow with h = 1. Linear waves
propagate forward and backward with the group velocities dω+/dk = 3 and dω−/dk = −3/5

40

according to the dispersion relation for the similarity model (116). This is a subcritical
situation in the laboratory frame, but, since the front velocity is c = 1 + h2 + h2
2 > 3, both
these waves propagate into the front. Therefore, the ﬂow is supercritical with respect to the
front.

To derive the dispersion relation of the equilibrium ﬂow with height h2 for ξ → −∞,
consider rescaling the height by h2. That is, we use this height as the characteristic length
so that a wave number k must be multiplied by h2. Since the ﬂow rate is q2 = h3
2 from
(80), the velocity has to be scaled by q2/h2 = h2
2. Thus, the group velocities for this ﬂow in
the laboratory frame are dω+/dk = 3h2
2. It is easy to show that
3h2
2 for h2 > 1. Thus, one wave component propagates into the front while
the other moves away from it so that the ﬂow behind the front is subcritical.

2 and dω−/dk = −(3/5)h2

2 > c = 1 + h2 + h2

Therefore, the moving front has a supercritical ﬂow on the shallower side and a subcritical
ﬂow on the deeper side, and can be regarded as a classical shock. Using the one-parameter
model instead of the similarity model is qualitatively identical.

4.5 Short wave limit

We now come back to the stationary equilibrium ﬂow, and study the dispersion relation in
the short wave range. Since the derivation of the averaged equations relies on the assumption
of predominantly horizontal ﬂow, it is not our aim to accurately resolve wave components
when k is large. We only hope that the short waves decay so that they do not interfere
with meaningful dynamics when we simulate the time-dependent model. Unfortunately, the
one-parameter model performs poorly in this respect compared to the similarity model.

The dispersion relation of the similarity model (112) can be approximated in the large k

limit as

Re ω± = ±√W k2 + O(k)
Im ω± = −

+ O(1/k).

3
2R

(125)

Thus, short waves in (89) are damped out if W > 0.

If we neglect the surface tension and set W = 0, the dispersion relation for large k is

ω± = c±k −

3i
2R

c± − 3
c± − 6/5

+ O(k−1)

where c± is the velocity of the corresponding wave given by

c± =

6

5 ±s 6

25

+

3

R tan α

.

(126)

(127)

Since c− < 6/5 from (127), the branch ω− is always stable, as can be seen from (126). On
the other hand, since c+ > 6/5, the condition for the stability of the branch ω+ is c+ < 3,
which is equivalent to

R tan α < 1.

(128)

41

For a large R the equilibrium state is no longer stable, but this is reasonable in the absence
of surface tension.

Now, we turn into the dispersion relation of the one-parameter model (114). For large k,

it behaves as

ω± ∼ ±k5/2qiW/75

and as

if W > 0,

(129)

(130)

ω± ∼ ±k3/2qi/(25 tan α)

if W = 0.

In either case one of the branches has an unstable component as k → ∞, irrespective of R
or α. We have been unable to ﬁnd a natural modiﬁcation to the one-parameter model which
prevents this unphysical behavior. Its cause may well be that the evolution of short waves
is not well represented by the boundary layer approximation we started with. In fact, in
the boundary layer equations (81) the higher order derivatives of x that are thought to be
crucial for stability of the high-k modes are neglected. In this view the similarity model (89)
provides surprisingly reasonable behaviour for large k, even starting from (81).

42

5 Conclusions

In this article we have presented a simple but fairly quantitative method of reducing ﬂows
with strongly deformed free surfaces to a manageable system of equations. By assuming a
“ﬂexible” velocity proﬁle whose shape parameter is another dependent variable, ﬂows with
an internal eddy can be described.
In the radial geometry our results compare well with
experiments and we have obtained analytic expressions for the circular hydraulic jump.

We have also studied the ﬂow down an inclined plane. The reduced equations possess not
only the traveling wave solutions (heteroclinic orbits) studied previously but also stationary
jump solutions. We have found that the stationary solutions show a stronger change in the
velocity proﬁle than the traveling waves.

Finally, we have classiﬁed diﬀerent parts of the ﬂows into super- and subcritical by study-
ing the dispersion relation around the equilibrium ﬂow. This classiﬁcation is standard for
inviscid shallow water ﬂow and in shock theory, but is is not obvious in the context of vis-
cous ﬂow. Indeed, for suﬃciently long waves the averaged equations show that supercritical
ﬂow is not possible. However, waves with intermediate lengths can make the ﬂow essentially
supercritical.

The only but serious defect of our reduced model which we have been unable to overcome
is its short wavelength behavior. As it stands now, some artiﬁcial dissipation term to stabilize
the short waves is necessary before time-dependent simulations are attempted. To our dismay
a more natural treatment of this problem has so far eluded us.

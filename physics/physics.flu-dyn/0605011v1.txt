“Breathing” rogue wave observed in numerical experiment

V. P. Ruban∗
Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, 2 Kosygin Street, 119334 Moscow, Russia
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Numerical simulations of the recently derived fully nonlinear equations of motion for weakly three-
dimensional water waves [V.P. Ruban, Phys. Rev. E 71, 055303(R) (2005)] with quasi-random
initial conditions are reported, which show the spontaneous formation of a single extreme wave on
the deep water. This rogue wave behaves in an oscillating manner and exists for a relatively long
time (many wave periods) without signiﬁcant change of its maximal amplitude.

INTRODUCTION

≈

The rogue waves (rare extreme events on a relatively
calm sea surface, alternatively called freak, killer, or gi-
ant waves), for a long time a part of marine folklore, since
1970’s have been methodically documented by oceanog-
raphers (see review [1] for examples and some relevant
statistics). From the viewpoint of nonlinear science, a
rogue wave is an extremely nonlinear object — typically,
the amplitude of a freak wave in maximum is close to
the amplitude of the corresponding limiting Stokes wave,
that is h/λ
0.10 . . . 0.14, where h is the peak-to-trough
height, and λ is the length of the wave [2]. Therefore, for
adequate quantitative investigation, this phenomenon re-
quires fully nonlinear equations and accurate numerical
methods. For two-dimensional (2D) potential ﬂows with
a free boundary, a very eﬃcient numerical scheme has
been developed recently by Zakharov and co-workers [3].
The scheme is based on exact (1+1)-dimensional equa-
tions of motion written for the surface shape and for the
boundary value of the velocity potential in terms of the
so called conformal variables (the corresponding exact
2D theory is described in Refs. [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]). The
method extensively uses algorithms of the discrete fast
Fourier transform (FFT). With applying this method,
impressive computations have been performed, where a
numerical giant wave developed due to the Benjamin-
Feir (modulational) instability [11, 12] from a slightly
perturbed Stokes wave. The spatial resolution in these
106 points [2]. As
numerical experiments was up to 2
to three-dimensional (3D) ﬂows, unfortunately, a similar
exact and compact (2+1)-dimensional form of equations
is absent. Therefore “exact” 3D simulations are currently
based on the rather expensive boundary element method
(BEM) and its modiﬁcations (see [13, 14, 15, 16], and
references therein). Since the underlying algorithms of
BEM are quite complicated, the best practically achieved
spatial resolutions on the free surface for essentially 3D
waves are typically few tens multiplied by few tens, as in
the recent works [14, 15, 16]. Deﬁnitely, this is not suf-

ﬁcient to simulate large wave systems with dozens and
hundreds waves, as it is necessary for practical applica-
tions. We exclude here the approximate equations de-
scribing wave envelopes [17, 18, 19, 20], because they are
not appropriate in real situations when many random
waves with very diﬀerent wave vectors and amplitudes
are excited. Other approximate equations, for instance
the weakly nonlinear Zakharov equations [21, 22, 23, 24],
are only good if the wave steepness is small, but this
is clearly not the case for the extreme waves. However,
though rogue waves are strongly nonlinear, and the wave
steepness cannot serve anymore as a small parameter of
the theory, nevertheless another small parameter may ex-
ist in the system. Namely, practically important is the
situation when relatively long (much longer than a typ-
ical wave length) wave crests are oriented along a deﬁ-
nite horizontal direction. For such weakly 3D ﬂows, the
advantages of the conformal variables are almost recov-
ered, as it has been explained in Refs. [25, 26]. In the
cited papers, the noncanonical Hamiltonian description
in terms of the conformal variables has been generalized
from 2D to 3D potential inviscid ﬂows with a free sur-
face, and the asymptotic expansion of the Hamiltonian
functional on the small parameter ǫ = (lx/lq)2 has been
suggested, where lx is a typical wave length, and lq is a
large transversal scale along the wave crests. In partic-
ular, the ﬁrst-order 3D corrections have been calculated
explicitly. What is important, all linear operators com-
ing into the equations are diagonal in the Fourier repre-
sentation. Therefore a relatively high spatial resolution
(16384
256 in Ref.[26]) for the corresponding numeri-
cal algorithm has been possible due to the large number
of local operations that result from the Fourier diagonal-
ization.
In Ref. [26] some numerical results have been
presented, for non-random initial conditions and typical
dimensionless wave numbers about 20.

×

In the present work another numerical experiment is
reported, which is more close to reality. Main wave num-
bers now are about 50, and the computations start with
a quasi-random initial state (shown in Fig. 1). Concern-
ing eﬃciency of the numerical implementation, it should
be noted that with the FFTW library [27], it takes less
than 2 min to perform one step of the Runge-Kutta-4 nu-
merical integration on an Intel Pentium 4 CPU 3.60GHz
with 2048M memory, for the maximal possible spatial

at any time moment t, there exists an analytical function
z(u + iv, q, t) which determines a conformal mapping of
the lower half-plane of a complex variable w = u + iv
on a region below the free surface. A shape of the free
surface is given in a parametric form:

Z = X + iY = z(u, q, t) = u + (i

ˆH)Y (u, q, t).

been observed as well, but contrary to the previous com-
putations [2] and [26], this freak wave is not breaking,
but it exists for many wave periods without tendency
towards increasing or decreasing its maximal amplitude
(which in this case is distinctly less than the limiting
Stokes wave amplitude, see Figs. 2-3). During the life
time, the rogue wave behaves in an oscillating manner,
with the highest crest being alternately ahead or behind
of the deepest trough. Observation of such kind of be-
havior is important for better understanding of the rogue
wave phenomenon.

II. EQUATIONS OF MOTION

Here it is necessary to present the equations that were
simulated. Their detailed derivation and discussion can
be found in Refs. [25, 26]. We use Cartesian coordinates
x, q, y, with y axis up-directed. The symbol z denotes the
x + iy. For every value of q,

A diﬀerence between the above expression (5) and the

of order ǫ2, since G(k, 0) = 1/(ik) for positive k, and
E(k, 0) = 1 (see Refs. [25, 26]). Besides that, the linear
dispersion relation resulting from ˜

Thus, all the wave numbers k and m are integer. Di-
mensionless time units imply g = 1. As an initial state,
a superposition of quasi-randomly placed wave packets
was taken, with 25 packets having wave vector (60, 2),
25 packets having wave vector (50, 0), 16 packets with
(40,
2), and 12 packets with (30, 1). Amplitudes of the
packets with k = 50 were dominating. Thus, a typical
wave length was 100 m, and a typical dimensionless wave
period T = 2π/√50
1. The crest of the highest wave
was initially less than 3 m above zero level. A map of the
free surface at t = 0 is shown in Fig.1. It is clear from
this ﬁgure that initially ǫ

The evolution of the system was computed with N =
16384 and L = 256 to t = 40.0, until beginning of a
rogue wave formation. After t = 40.0, the rogue wave
was present in the system (see Fig. 4), and during many
wave periods its height in maximum was approximately
7 m, as Fig. 2 shows. It resulted in widening of the wave
spectrum (see Fig. 5, where ǫ
0.05), and
therefore L = 512 was employed from t = 40.0 to t =
60.0. Within this period, the total energy was decreased
by 0.5% due to numerical errors. Finally, from t = 60.0
and to the end of the experiment, L = 1024 was used
to avoid progressive loss of the accuracy (the last stage
has required computer with 3072M memory, and it took
5 min per one step of integration).

The presence of rogue wave strongly aﬀects the prob-
ability distribution function P (y) of the free surface el-
evation y(x, q). Fig. 6 shows that the distribution has
a Gaussian core and “heavy” tails, which are not sym-
metric – large positive y are more probable than large
negative y.

The most interesting observation of the present nu-
merical experiment is that the freak wave can exist for a
relatively long time without signiﬁcant tendency towards
breaking or disappearing. While “living”, the big wave
does something similar to breathing, as shown in Fig. 7.
The rogue wave propagates along the free surface (with
the typical group velocity, but there is also a displace-
ment in q-direction), and position of the highest crest is

5

alternately ahead or behind of the deepest trough. Very
roughly this behavior corresponds to a short wave enve-
lope (with approximately one wave length inside) ﬁlled
with a strongly nonlinear periodic Stokes-like wave. The
time period of this “breathing” roughly equals to two
wave periods, which property seems natural due to the
fact that the group velocity of the gravitational waves
is one half of the phase velocity. After 11 periods of
“breathing” with the almost constant amplitude 7 m, the
rogue wave gradually irradiates accumulated energy into
a speciﬁc wave pattern visible in Fig. 4 at t = 91. This
wave pattern nearly corresponds to the resonance condi-
tion

where the wave vector k0 = (k0, m0) characterizes the

sion relation. However, a more accurate explanation and
an analytical study of the observed coherent nonlinear
structure is a subject of future work.

IV. SUMMARY

Thus, the recently developed fully nonlinear theory for
long-crested water waves, together with the correspond-
ing FFT-based numerical method [26] are shown in this
work to be an adequate tool for modeling rogue waves in
close to real situations, that is with many random waves
propagating mainly along a deﬁnite horizontal direction.
Now it has been possible to deal with quite high spatial
resolutions, since in the present algorithm all the non-
local operations are reduced to the FFT computing, and
the latter is really fast with modern numerical libraries.
Diﬀerent dynamical regimes of the rogue wave evolution
can be investigated. In particular, the present article re-
ports observation of a long-lived rogue wave. Such waves
are deﬁnitely important from practical viewpoint.

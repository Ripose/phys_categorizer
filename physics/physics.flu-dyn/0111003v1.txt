We consider the motion of an axisymmetric column of Navier-Stokes ﬂuid with a free surface. Due
to surface tension, the thickness of the ﬂuid neck goes to zero in ﬁnite time. After the singularity,
the ﬂuid consists of two halves, which constitute a unique continuation of the Navier-Stokes equation
through the singular point. We calculate the asymptotic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation,
both before and after the singularity. The solutions have scaling form, characterized by universal
exponents as well as universal scaling functions, which we compute without adjustable parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION

The breakup of free-surface ﬂows has been an object of intense research from the advent of hydrodynamic theory,
and in particular the discovery of surface tension [1–3]. Namely, surface tension is the driving force behind this
phenomenon, as it tends to reduce the surface area by decreasing the radius of a column of ﬂuid. This indeed leads
to the formation of drops, as is seen most clearly from Rayleigh’s [4] stability analysis of an inﬁnite cylinder of ﬂuid
with radius r0.

He considered perturbations of diﬀerent wavelengths and calculated their growth rates. While long wavelength
perturbations result in the smallest surface area, they require large mass transport between maxima and minima.
Both eﬀects strike a balance at the wavelength λ
9r0, corresponding to the fastest growing mode. This type of
analysis subsequently has been greatly reﬁned, for example including viscosity [5], surface charges [6], or higher order
nonlinear eﬀects [7].

≈

However, even higher order perturbation theory rapidly becomes inadequate as the thickness of the ﬂuid neck goes to
zero at a point, and ﬂuid is expelled from this region with increasingly high speed. Near the singularity, characterized
by a blow-up of local curvature, and of the velocity at the pinch-point, nonlinear eﬀects will soon dominate the
dynamics. An asymptotic scaling theory of this singularity, where surface tension, viscous, and inertial forces are
balanced, has been presented very recently [8].

But eventually the size of the neck or the times scale on which it is moving will reach microscopic scales, and a
hydrodynamic description breaks down altogether. For example, the neck will evaporate somewhere close to the pinch
point, where it has minimum thickness. Shortly after that, new surfaces will have formed on either side, and this time
the dynamics is described by two separate Navier-Stokes problems. The physical question we address here is whether
the new initial conditions depend on the microscopic mechanisms behind the breakup. In other words, taking two
diﬀerent kinds of ﬂuids with the same surface tension, density, and viscosity, will the breakup look the same on scales
larger than the microscopic ones?

We will indeed show that drop formation is a hydrodynamic phenomenon in the above sense. Namely, we construct
asymptotic solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation after breakup, which describe two separate surfaces and which
are unique continuations of the solutions before breakup. The physical origin of this uniqueness lies in the properties
of the solution before breakup [8]. The diameter of the ﬂuid neck does not go to zero uniformly, but only inside a
“hot” region around the pinch point. Outside, the solution is static on the time scale of the central region. As one
approaches the singularity, the size of the hot region goes to zero. Hence by the time microscopic mechanisms become
important, their action is conﬁned to an extremely small region in space. The continuation is achieved by matching
the outer parts of the solution before breakup onto the corresponding regions after breakup. Since the outer parts
are virtually unaﬀected by the microscopic dynamics, this procedure yields universal continuations.

This seems to be the ﬁrst example of a partial diﬀerential equation uniquely describing a “topological transition”
[9]. The result is also important for numerical simulations, which usually rely on some ad-hoc prescription for the
formation of a new surface [10,11], or for breakup in related physical situations [12].

Our paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we derive a one-dimensional approximation of the Navier-Stokes
equation [13,14], valid as the ratio ǫ of the radial to the longitudinal scale of the ﬂow is small. They have self- similar
pinching solutions, which are described by a pair of scaling functions φ(ξ) and ψ(ξ) for the radius of the ﬂuid neck
and the velocity, respectively. As the time distance from the singularity goes to zero, the slenderness parameter ǫ for
this solution vanishes, making it an exact solution asymptotically.

The scaling functions φ and ψ obey two pairs of ordinary diﬀerential equations, one for the time before breakup, the
other for the time after breakup. For most of the rest of this paper, we will be constructing unique solutions to those
equations. In the third section we consider the similarity equations before breakup. Shortly before the singularity, the
ﬂuid far outside the pinch region is no longer able to follow the motion near the pinch point. This leads to boundary
conditions for the similarity functions at inﬁnity, and together with a regularity condition in the interior, a unique
solution of the equations is selected. We compute this solution numerically.

The same procedure is adopted in the fourth section for the similarity equations after breakup. Here the solution
is matched onto the proﬁles before breakup. This solution has two halves, each of which is ﬁxed uniquely by the
matching.

The concluding discussion gives an example for the breakup of a real ﬂuid, which could be measured experimentally.
We also supply numerical evidence for the uniqueness and stability of our theoretical predictions, and discuss related
work.

II. SIMILARITY EQUATIONS

Let us begin by formulating the Navier-Stokes problem for an axisymmetric column of ﬂuid, where we assume the
azimuthal velocity to be zero. A sketch of the geometry of the problem can be found in Figure 1. For a ﬂuid with
kinematic viscosity ν, surface tension γ, and density ρ the Navier-Stokes equation reads in cylindrical coordinates
[15]:

∂tvr + vr∂rvr + vz∂zvr =

The acceleration of gravity points in negative z-direction. Here vz is the velocity along the axis, vr the velocity in the
radial direction, and p the pressure. There are two boundary conditions, coming from the balance of normal forces,

and tangential forces

∂rvr + ∂zvz + vr/r = 0.

n σ n =

γ(1/R1 + 1/R2),

−

n σ t = 0.

In (4),(5) we denoted the outward normal and tangent vector to the surface by n and t, σ is the stress tensor, and

(1/R1 + 1/R2)/2 the mean curvature. A standard formula for bodies of revolution gives

where H(z, t) is the radius of the ﬂuid neck, as seen in Figure 1. The equation of motion for H(z, t) is

which says that the surface moves with the ﬂuid at the boundary.

Equations (1)-(7) constitute a complex moving boundary value problem, which we want to investigate near a
singularity, where nonlinear eﬀects are bound to become dominant. The reason exact solutions, valid arbitrarily close
to the singularity, can nevertheless be found, is that only very few terms in the equations contribute to the leading
order force balance. Thus to proceed, we ﬁrst have to identify those leading order terms. We will then construct
explicit solutions to the leading order equations and demonstrate their consistency with both the internal structure
of the Navier- Stokes equation and with boundary conditions.

The relevant terms are identiﬁed using two properties of the singularity to be validated later:

(i) The singularity is line-like, i. e. its axial extension is much greater than its radial extension.

(ii) Surface tension, viscous, and inertial forces are equally important near the singularity.

Conditions (i) and (ii) are now incorporated into a perturbation theory. According to (i) we will assume that the
motion of the ﬂuid at a given time is characterized by an axial length scale ℓz and a radial length scale ℓr, for which

where ǫ is some small parameter. The physical meaning of ǫ will come out later from the description of the singularity.
Also introducing a time scale tz of the singularity, we can nondimensionalize all quantities according to

The scales ℓz, ℓr, and tz are deﬁned to be constants, so their derivative with respect to time is zero. However,
one must bear in mind that the characteristic scales of the singularity change, so ℓz, ℓr, and tz will be diﬀerent in
diﬀerent stages of the singularity formation. Since there are two length scales ℓz and ℓr, there is a certain freedom
in the nondimensionalization of the material parameters ν, γ/ρ, and g. This freedom is completely speciﬁed by the
exponents n, m, and l in (9). We will see below that the exponents are ﬁxed by the requirement (ii).

Since the radial extension of the ﬂuid is small, we can expand all ﬁelds in the dimensionless radial variable ˜r :

The deﬁnition of ˜vr automatically ensures incompressibility. We now insert (9)-(12) into the equations of motion

(1)-(7), and compare powers in ǫ. The lowest order expressions result in a closed set of equations for ˜v0 and ˜H,

To obtain closure at higher orders in ǫ, one needs to expand each of the coeﬃcients ˜v2j and ˜p2j, as well as ˜H into a
separate power series in ǫ. There then exists a consistent representation of (1)-(7) to all orders in ǫ [16]. We will not
be concerned with the explicit form of the higher order equations here, so for simplicity we use the notation v0 and
H (or its nondimensional counterpart) for the lowest order terms in the expansion in ǫ.

It is evident from (13) that the exponents m, n, and l determine the balance of forces at leading order. Since the
1/ ˜H term, which comes from the radius of curvature perpendicular to the axis, is driving the instability, it must
clearly be present and in fact becomes inﬁnite at the singularity. At the small scales involved in singularity formation,
viscosity will also be important. Finally, velocities are expected to blow up as ever smaller amounts of liquid are
driven by increasingly large pressure gradients. Hence we also expect inertial eﬀects to be involved asymptotically.
Since the acceleration of the ﬂuid diverges at the pinch point, the constant acceleration of gravity will drop out of
the problem. This is precisely the assumption (ii), incorporated by choosing m = 1, n = 0, and l > 0 in (9), which
leads to an equation where surface tension, viscous, and inertial forces are balanced, while gravity is irrelevant. These
assumptions will be tested for consistency later.

We now identify the scales involved in the formation of the singularity. It is crucial to notice that all external
length and time scales, which are imposed by boundary and initial conditions, do not enter the description of the
singularity. In a jet experiment, for example, external scales would be the radius of the nozzle and the period of the
driving frequency.

Near the singularity, the length scales characterizing the solution become arbitrarily small, while time scales become
shorter and shorter as one approaches the singularity. Hence the singularity moves on scales widely separated from
the external scales. It is for this reason that for the mathematical analysis of the singularity we do not have to make
the boundary or initial conditions explicit. Boundary and initial conditions will become important when we describe
numerical simulations of real experiments, which conﬁrm the consistency of our approach.

The proper units in which to represent the motion near the singularity can thus involve only internal parameters

of the ﬂuid. This leaves us with the units of length and time

ℓν = (ρν2)/γ

,

tν = (ρ2ν3)/γ2

.

Assuming that the singularity occurs at a point z0, and at a time t0, the space and time distance from the singularity

All material parameters have dropped out of the equations, since everything has been expressed in units of ℓν and tν.
At this point it is worthwhile to pause and notice that we have already succeeded in reducing the original Navier-
Stokes problem in two spatial dimensions and in time with a moving boundary to just a coupled set of equations in
one space dimension and time, at least for small ǫ. Approximations for thin liquid threads of the type described here
have in fact a long history, see [13] for a (by no means complete) list of earlier references. However it seems that
(18),(19), which contain the correct surface tension, inertial, and viscous terms, were ﬁrst derived in [13]. Another
related approach goes by the name of Cosserat equations, see for example [17]. In all previous work except [8] though,
the resulting one- dimensional equations are treated as model equations, whose quality of approximation depends on
the particular physical situation for which they are used. In the present paper, we will show that (18), (19) become
exact close to pinch-oﬀ.

To this end we have to identify the parameter ǫ. From the deﬁnitions (15) we ﬁnd

tz/tν = ǫ2 ˜γ2
˜ρ2 ˜ν3

,

ℓz/ℓν = ǫ

.

˜γ
˜ρ˜ν2

Thus up to constants ǫ2 is the characteristic time scale of the singularity, written in units of tν. But the only such
time scale is the nondimensional time distance from the singularity
serves as the desired smallness
parameter. We introduced the modulus of t′ here, since we need a measure of the time distance before and after the
0, all higher order terms vanish and only the leading order equations (18),(19) remain. By the

III. BEFORE BREAKUP

In this section we consider the similarity equations (23), (24) for s = 1, i.e. before breakup. Some of the calculations
relevant for the next section will be done for general s. We show that the similarity equations have precisely one
physically allowed solution, and compute it. Therefore singular solutions are completely universal: once the origins
of the space and time axes are ﬁxed by specifying z0 and t0, there are no more free parameters. The relevant units of
length and time are set by the ﬂuid parameters.

As the similarity equations are of ﬁrst order in φ and of second order in ψ, solutions are speciﬁed by three initial
conditions φ(ξi), ψ(ξi), and ψ′(ξi) at a reference point ξi. Universality implies that we need to ﬁnd three conditions
which uniquely ﬁx the physically allowed solution.

For the ﬁrst condition, suppose we choose a small region of width ℓνδ around the singularity, such that δ

≪
min(1, L/ℓν), where L characterizes some outer length scale. For
1 we are well within the critical

Conditions similar to b) have also been employed in [19]. Note that the physical concept behind our argument is
inertia, which prohibits the large amount of ﬂuid far away from the singularity to move with the ﬂuid in the skinny
pinch region.

We will now show that the requirements a) and b) completely determine the solution of the similarity equations.
In particular, we do not have to specify the limiting values of φ(ξ)/ξ2, they rather come out of the solution of the
problem. This is consistent because in our analysis we deal exclusively with the equations of motion valid close to the
singularity. No input from regions where the expansion is not valid is needed. Thus boundary or initial conditions
can enter the problem only implicitly, as they determine the position of the singularity z0,t0.

Let us begin by examining the behavior of solutions for ξ

. It is advantageous to ﬁrst eliminate φ from the

problem, leaving us with a third-order equation for ψ [20]. To this end (24) is written as

This means for large ξ all solutions of (28) are up to exponentially small corrections given by a two- parameter
family of functions ψa0b0(ξ) [21], which behave like 1/ξ asymptotically. The expansion (29) is asymptotic to ψa0b0(ξ)

and for suﬃciently large ξ can be used to compute ψa0b0 (ξ) to any desired accuracy. To understand the signiﬁcance
of this observation, we have to investigate the stability of the functions ψa0b0 (ξ).

Doing so turns out to be slightly more convenient in the original space of initial conditions (φ( ¯ξ), ψ( ¯ξ), ψ′( ¯ξ)),
where ¯ξ
1 is kept ﬁxed. Denoting by φab(ξ) the function φ corresponding to ψab(ξ), we are interested in particular
in perturbations which carry us out of the two-dimensional manifold of initial conditions (φab( ¯ξ), ψab( ¯ξ), ψ′
ab( ¯ξ)).
Diﬀerentiating with respect to a and b, we ﬁnd that to leading order in ¯ξ, (0, 0, 1) is a vector normal to this manifold.

We now consider small perturbations relative to the solutions φab,ψab:

To ﬁnd the third constraint we look at condition a), saying that φ, ψ be regular. Considering (25) this is a nontrivial

condition, as ψ must be bounded and hence there is a point ξ0 with

Therefore, since s = 1, the denominator in (25) will vanish at ξ0, leading to a singularity unless the condition

To explicitly compute the unique solution of the similarity equations before breakup, consistent with a) and b),
we proceed as follows: we choose a pair (ξ0, φ0) and compute the Taylor coeﬃcients di to suﬃciently high order.
This leaves us with a series representation of ψ in a disk around ξ0. From there onwards, (28) has to be integrated

As seen in Table 1, the stagnation point ξ0 is extremely close to the point ξmin where φ+ is minimum. This means

To make contact with the qualitative description of the singularity given in the Introduction, we schematically
divide the similarity solutions into three regions: A central region around the minimum of size ξcentral, say, where
φ is almost constant, and outer regions on either side, where φ is quadratic. In this simpliﬁed picture, in physical

Another, perhaps related problem pertains to the uniqueness of the above solution. In principle, the one-dimensional
submanifolds corresponding to the correct asymptotic behavior as ξ
could have several crossings,
giving a discrete family of solutions. The most reasonable guess for a diﬀerent form of solution would be a symmetric
one, which would then be highly unstable, since small asymmetries would amplify according to the above mechanism.
Since ξ0 = 0 for such a solution, φ0 would be the only free parameter, which needs to be consistent with the behavior
at inﬁnity. We carefully looked for solutions of this type, but found none. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge,
there is precisely one possible solution, but for a ﬁnal word we must await a rigorous mathematical theory.

IV. AFTER BREAKUP

We now turn to times t > t0, i.e. after breakup. In terms of the similarity equations (23),(24) this means we have

now, related to the mathematical description of a receding tip.

To understand this, let us consider the asymptotic equations (18),(19), which contain the leading order terms of the
Navier-Stokes equation as the slenderness parameter ǫ goes to zero. But this description breaks down as one reaches
the tip, which is assumed to be at z′
tip(t), see Figure 3. Namely, the slenderness assumption means that ∂z′ h is of
order ǫ, while ∂z′h actually diverges as z′

To derive the correct boundary condition, we proceed as follows: We supplement (18),(19) with higher order terms
in ǫ, which regularize the equations at the tip. The corresponding similarity equations in φ and ψ now still contain
t′ as a parameter, but are ﬁnite as ξ
ξtip. This means solutions of those equations can be supplemented with the

natural boundary condition φ(ξtip) = 0.

Then we derive a simpliﬁed version of the equations valid at the tip, which we can integrate explicitly, using
φ(ξtip) = 0 as a boundary condition. Now we can take the limit
0, which leaves us with the correct
boundary conditions for φ and ψ, valid for t′ = 0. We also show that this result is independent of the particular
regularization we have been using, so the result is unique, as expected from the above argument. Once the boundary
condition has been found, we can solve the similarity equations to ﬁnd a unique solution after breakup.

There are certainly other higher order correction terms present in the Navier-Stokes equation, which have not been

Hence by putting ℓ = 0 in (51) we obtain a simpliﬁed description of the tip region, which is uniformly valid in
any ﬁxed interval [0, ζ1]. Note that implicitly ℓ is still present by virtue of (50). Solutions of the resulting equations
correspond to a very much blown-up version of the tip. Since the solutions are regular at ζ = 0, we can employ the
natural boundary condition ¯φ(0) = 0, and from (53) we have ¯G(0) = ¯D(0) = 0. This means (51) can be integrated to

We now supply appropriate matching conditions, which express the consistency of (52) and (54), valid at the tip,

arbitrarily small in ξ-variables this is physically reasonable, but has also been checked numerically by integrating

the constants a0 and b0 are diﬀerent for the left and right hand side of the problem, the solutions will also diﬀer. In
particular, the value of ξtip consistent with (56) depends on a0 and b0. The requirement (56) thus represents the way

V. DISCUSSION

We have shown that the motion of a Navier-Stokes ﬂuid close to the time of breakup is described by self-similar
solutions. The corresponding scaling functions, before and after the breakup, are solutions to a set of ordinary
diﬀerential equations. For the solutions to be consistent, both away from the singular point and at the receding tip
after breakup, boundary conditions have to be imposed. They lead to unique solutions of the similarity equations. This
means solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation close to the singularity are predicted without adjustable parameters,
and independent of boundary or initial conditions. It is quite instructive to plot the predicted interface of a real ﬂuid
at constant time intervals before and after the singularity. Since ℓν and tν are almost on molecular scales for water
[14], we take a mixture of glycerol and ethanol as a reference ﬂuid, for which ℓν = 72µm and tν = 114µs. This is
large enough for experiments by optical means to be feasible. Measurements of the velocity ﬁeld are also possible
[24]. Figure 5 shows three proﬁles, each 46µs apart, before the singularity (a), and after the singularity (b). This
corresponds to
= 1, 0.55, and 0.1. In particular, there is no freedom in the spatial scale of this Figure. The same
graph should apply regardless of boundary conditions.

|

Before breakup, one can clearly distinguish a very slender neck, and the steep front of the adjoining drop. As the
neck becomes thinner, the minimum moves towards the drop, making the interface even steeper. The greatest relative
changes in the diameter occur near the minimum, far away the interface is practically static. As one comes closer to
the singularity, the size of the “active” region, which is still changing, becomes smaller and smaller.

After breakup, the neck snaps back very rapidly, forming a sharp front at the end. For

= 1, higher order
will probably be already important, and the end will look more rounded. As seen in Figure 4, there
corrections in
is also some ﬂuid accumulating at the end in the asymptotic solutions, but this cannot be seen on the scale of Figure
5. The small protrusion on the drop, left by the breakup, quickly relaxes to an almost ﬂat interface.

|

The asymmetry of the breakup was already noticed in experiments [25,26]. However, one must be careful not to
apply our results to those experiments directly, since they are on length and time scales z′
1, far away
from the asymptotic behavior. Still our similarity solutions could play a crucial role for the shape selection even in
this “inviscid” regime, since all solution must ultimately match onto the asymptotic behavior. Clearly, an extension
of our theory to the almost inviscid regime seems highly desirable.

Recently, an experimental study of drop formation in a highly viscous ﬂuid has been reported [27]. Qualitatively,
the shape of the interface adjoining the primary drop agrees well with Figure 5. Also, the length and time scales
of the similarity solution, as given by the present theory, have been used to analyze the data and are found to be
consistent with experiment. Unfortunately, at the times shown in Figure 2A and Figure 2B of [27], the straining due
to the falling drop is still appreciable compared with the scales of the similarity solution. Also, there is no independent
measurement of t′ available, which makes a meaningful comparison with theory diﬃcult at present. We will discuss
the process of repeated necking, reported in [27], below.

Extensive experiments with high-speed jets, where gravity is irrelevant, are also in progress [28]. The stroboscopical
method employed for example in [29] allows to determine t′ independently, so comparison with theory can be made
without adjustable parameters. Preliminary results show nice agreement with theory before breakup. After breakup
a quantitative comparison with theory is not yet possible, due to air drag on the rapidly receding neck, whose eﬀect
is not yet included in the equations.

Therefore, we will use numerical simulations for a detailed comparison with theory. In particular, we would like to
verify the prediction of the theory that the same similarity solutions are always approached, independent of boundary
or initial conditions. Indeed, some simulations have already been performed on the breakup of a Navier-Stokes ﬂuid
[30], but they are not suﬃciently close enough to the singularity to allow for a meaningful comparison. This is because
in the asymptotic region Navier-Stokes computations become prohibitively expensive. To make simulations feasible,
one has to resort to approximations.

As model equations, we take the generalized form of the asymptotic equations (40) and (41). Extensive simulations

of this system before breakup were already reported in [14], [8], and [27]. The equations read

So apart from the asymptotic terms already contained in (18) and (19), (63) contains the exact expression for the mean
curvature of a body of revolution. The system (61)-(63) was supplemented with two types of boundary conditions
[14]:

In the “jet geometry” we ﬁx the values of H and v0 at two ﬁxed points z+ and z− :

Rayleigh instability. The jet speed is so high that gravitational eﬀects can be neglected, and thus g = 0.

In the “drop geometry” ﬂuid is released slowly from a tap. Thus at the opening of the tap,z− say, boundary
conditions (64) and (65) hold, while at the lower end of the drop the boundary moves with the ﬂuid. This means we

In this experimental situation gravity is of course important, as initially gravitational and surface tension forces are
balanced, and the drop assumes an equilibrium shape [31]. These shapes are reproduced exactly by the stationary
solutions of (61)-(63). Eventually, gravity overcomes surfaces tension and the drop falls and subsequently pinches oﬀ.
The implementation of boundary conditions as well as the numerical procedure is explained in detail in [14]. In
[14] and [27] simulations of (61)-(63) have been used to reproduce experimental interface shapes both for high and

low viscosity ﬂuids in diﬀerent geometries. In particular in the case of a slowly dripping tap [26], both boundary and
initial conditions are known and comparison with experiment can be done without adjustable parameters. Thus the
excellent agreement between simulation and the experimental shape of a falling drop at the pinch point [14] seems
highly signiﬁcant. Therefore we are conﬁdent that (61)-(63) represents a good approximation to the Navier-Stokes
equation not only close to the pinch point, but also for earlier times and including the crossover to the boundary.

We have performed systematic tests of the predictions of the present theory, in particular investigating the inde-
pendence of the singular behavior near break- oﬀ from boundary conditions. For all runs, both in the jet and the drop
geometry, and independent of the nozzle or tap diameter and of the viscosity, we always found the ﬂow to converge
onto the similarity solution predicted by the present theory.

Figure 6 shows this convergence for a typical run in the jet geometry. The nozzle diameter is 100 in units of ℓν.
The solution near the singularity has been converted to similarity variables, thus giving φ(ξ) and ψ(ξ) using the
transformation (22). Shown is the predicted similarity solution as a solid line, and the computed solution at times

be seen that the range of validity of the similarity solution expands like
|
means there is a ﬁxed region in z′ where the similarity theory applies, in agreement with the statements of Section 3.
At the boundary of this region, the slope ∂z′h becomes of order unity, and the expansion in orders of ǫ breaks down.
The motion shown in Figure 6 occurs on scales widely separated from those imposed by the boundary conditions.
The time distance from the onset of the linear instability to the singularity is t0/tν = 32284, much larger than the
relevant t′. Similarly, the nozzle diameter, converted to the similarity variable ξ, is ξ = 157, 272, 473, and 829, for
the times shown. Clearly the motion near the singularity has become independent of these imposed length and time
scales. The same will happen for any boundary condition, as both the typical time and length scale shrinks to zero
near the singularity.

Next we test the convergence onto the similarity solution after breakup. Since there is a moving tip, we modify the

viscous term in (61) to regularize the tip. The force balance now reads

where a is a free constant. By varying a we can test our prediction that the shape of the interface after breakup does
not depend on the regularization employed.

To produce an initial condition after breakup, we take a simulation before breakup, which has progressed to a
= 10−4 from the singularity. Then we cut the solution at the minimum and interpolate H to
time distance of
zero with a polynomial, so as to keep the highest derivatives smooth. This we take as the new initial condition after
breakup and let the solution evolve under (68), (62), and (63). For a wide range of values of a in (68), we always ﬁnd
the solution to converge onto the similarity form found in Section 4. Figure 7 illustrates this convergence for a run
which has the same boundary conditions and material parameters as the one shown in Figure 6 before breakup. The
constant a was chosen to be 1. Again, solutions were converted to similarity variables. The full line represents the

predicted similarity solution, the dot-dashed and the dashed lines show the numerical simulations for
t′
= 0.06 after the singularity. The dotted line is the similarity solution before breakup, shown for comparison. It
|
can clearly be seen that after the solution has been cut in two halves it rapidly converges onto the predicted similarity
form. This is independent of both the regularizing term in (68) and the procedure by which the solution is cut.

t′
Hence both before and after the singularity, we have always observed convergence onto the similarity solutions if
|
|
is small. Still it would be very useful to have a better mathematical understanding of the approach of the similarity
solution for the full Navier-Stokes dynamics. Even for the simpliﬁed model equations (61)-(63) the convergence we
found numerically is far from being a trivial result, as there are higher order derivative terms like ∂3
z H coming from
the pressure. In principle, although these terms are multiplied by a small number t′ close to the singularity, they could
make a singular perturbation, which changes the asymptotics. However, it is well beyond the scope of this paper to
explore these questions in detail, so at present we have to rely on the ample numerical evidence.

Another important question is the stability of the similarity solution to small perturbations. This has been studied
in the framework of the asymptotic equations (18),(19) in [32], both numerically and analytically. The result is that
the similarity solutions are linearly stable as expected, since there are observed numerically. On the other hand, they
are unstable to ﬁnite amplitude perturbations of wavelength comparable to the minimum radius of the ﬂuid neck.

As soon as a perturbation is large enough, it will start to grow and eventually forms a new similarity solution with
its own z0 and t0. For any ﬁnite number of such perturbations, the singularities are separated in space and the present
theory strictly applies. However, if one explicitly adds an external white noise source to the Navier-Stokes equation,
perturbations are introduced on all time scales arbitrarily close to the singularity. This allows for the appearance of
a “rough” interface as described in [27] and [32], consisting of an inﬁnity of interacting similarity solutions. Locally,
the form of each of those solutions, seen as “necks” in experiment, is consistent with the present theory.

was identiﬁed, below which thermal ﬂuctuations become important. The relevant thermal length scale for surface
perturbations is ℓT = (kBT /γ)1/2. For a mixture of 85% glycerol and 15% water ℓthres is 1µm. Thus, in the presence
of thermal ﬂuctuations, the microscopic length scale ℓmicro introduced in Section 3 may be replaced by ℓthres: for Hmin
larger than ℓthres the Navier-Stokes equation is applicable, on smaller scales the equations are inherently stochastic.
An obvious beneﬁt one expects from the universality found in the present paper is the unique continuation of
Navier-Stokes simulations through the singularity. One slight problem lies in the nonanalyticity of φ− and ψ− if one
wants to use similarity solutions as new initial conditions after breakup. Although the pressure itself would be ﬁnite,
pressure gradients and the viscous term would be inﬁnite at the tip. Thus it is better to use regularized similarity
functions, where a small but ﬁnite cut-oﬀ parameter ℓ has been introduced. The resulting initial conditions for the
new Navier-Stokes problem after the singularity would be arbitrarily close to the similarity form, but still ﬁnite at
the tip.

In conclusion, we have shown that the Navier-Stokes equation carries us through the bifurcation point where at ﬁrst
it seems meaningless. As usual, classical hydrodynamic theory has a much wider range of applicability than purely
microscopic considerations would tell us.

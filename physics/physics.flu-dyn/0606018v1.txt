ABSTRACT

We predict theoretically the nondiﬀractive propagation of sonic waves in periodic acoustic

media (sonic crystals), by expansion into a set of plane waves (Bloch mode expansion),

and by ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain calculations of ﬁnite beams. We also give analytical

evaluations of the parameters for nondiﬀractive propagation, as well as the minimum size of

the nondiﬀractively propagating acoustic beams.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the dynamics of waves, even in simple linear media, initiated hundreds of

year ago, ever and ever leads to surprisingly new results and insights. One of such “surprises”

was the discovery of band gaps in the propagation of light in materials with the refraction

index periodically modulated on the scale of the optical wavelength, the so called photonic

crystals1. The theory of wave propagation in periodic materials was developed long time ago

by Bloch and Floquet, and it found many applications in solid state physics, in particular in

the studies of electronic properties of semiconductors (calculation of valence and conduction

bands, etc). Nevertheless, the advent of the photonic crystals initiated a revival of the theory

of wave propagation in periodic media. The creation and control of photonic band gaps2,

the slowing down of light3, and the photonic crystal waveguides are the main applications to

the date. Most of these studies concern the propagation of plane waves (not the beams), and

results in the modiﬁcation of the temporal dispersion relation (frequency versus propagation

wavenumber). Later, the strong analogies between the propagation of light and sound (which

obey similar wave equations) motivated the study of sound propagation in periodic acoustic

media, the so called sonic or phononic crystals (SC). Many of the results obtained in the

photonic case have been reported in the sonic case. For a review on this topic, see e.g. Ref.

4.

Most of the studies reported above concern the one-dimensional (1D) periodic struc-

tures, as the 1D case, being relatively simple, allows an analytical treatment. The multi-

dimensional cases (the 2D case as in our present study, or even the 3D case) are much more

diﬃcult to be accessed analytically. The majority of these studies in multi-dimensional

case are numeric, as using plane-wave expansion, or ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain (FDTD)

schemes. These studies also mostly concern the modiﬁcation of the temporal dispersion

characteristics.

It comes out recently, that the spatial periodicity can aﬀect not only temporal dispersion,

but also the spatial one, i.e. the dependence of the longitudinal component of the propaga-

tion constant versus the transverse component. These results (again predominantly numeric)

lead to so called management of spatial dispersion, i.e. to the management of diﬀraction

properties of narrow beams. This idea led to the prediction of the negative diﬀraction of

light beams in photonic crystals5, of sound beams in sonic crystals6, and of coherent atomic

3

ensembles in Bose-Einstein condensates in periodic potentials7. In particular it has been

found recently that between the normal diﬀraction and negative diﬀraction regimes a strong

reduction of the diﬀraction can be achieved, leading to the so called self-collimating, or

nondiﬀractive light beams8.

The geometrical interpretation of wave diﬀraction is as follows: wave beams of arbitrary

shape can be Fourier decomposed into plane waves, which in propagation acquire phase

shifts depending on their propagation angles. This dephasing of the plane wave components

results in a diﬀractive broadening of the beams. Fig.1(a) illustrates normal diﬀraction in

propagation through an homogeneous material, where the longitudinal component of the
2, where

wavevector depends trivially on the propagation angle, k|| = kz =

q|

k⊥ = (kx, ky).

In general, the normal or positive diﬀraction means that the surfaces of

constant frequency are concave in the wavevector domain k = (kx, ky, kz), as illustrated in

Fig.1(a). The negative diﬀraction, as illustrated in Fig.1(b), geometrically means that the

surfaces of constant frequency are convex in wavevector domain. The intermediate case of

the vanishing diﬀraction is illustrated in Fig.1(c), where the zero diﬀraction is supposed to

occur at a particular point in the wavevector domain where the curvature of the surfaces of

constant frequency becomes exactly zero. Zero diﬀraction physically means that beams of

arbitrary width can propagate without diﬀractive broadening or, equivalently, that arbitrary

wave structures can propagate without diﬀractive “smearing”.

The present study concerns the nondiﬀractive propagation of sound in periodic acoustic

materials (sonic crystals). We found, by applying the plane-wave expansion method, the

existence of nondiﬀractive regimes similar to those in optics, or to those expected from

Fig.1(c). We check the nondiﬀractive propagation by integrating the wave equations by

means of the FDTD technique. Moreover, we also present the analytical treatment of the

problem, leading to analytic relations, which among other are useful for the planning of the

corresponding experiment, and for designing the possible applications.

In Section II of the article the propagation of sound is analysed by plane wave expan-

sion, leading to the spatial dispersion curves, and in particular resulting into the straight

(nondiﬀractive) segments of the spatial dispersion curves.

In this way the nondiﬀractive

propagation regimes are predicted. In the next Section III the FDTD calculations are per-

formed in the predicted nondiﬀractive regimes, and the nonspreading propagation of narrow

beams is demonstrated. Section IV is devoted to the analytical study, to the derivation

4

of analytical relations between parameters for the nondiﬀractive propagation. Last Section

contains the concluding remarks, where the results are summarized and also the minimal

size of the beams propagating nondiﬀractively is evaluated.

The propagation of sonic waves is determined by the following linear system equations

where B(r) is the bulk modulus, ρ(r) is the density (both dependent in space), p(r, t) is the

pressure (which are scalar ﬁelds), and v(r, t) is the velocity vector ﬁeld.

We deﬁne the relative values of the bulk modulus ¯B(r) = B(r)/Bh and the density ¯ρ(r) =
ρ(r)/ρh, normalizing to the corresponding parameters in the host medium. Then, eliminating

the velocity ﬁeld in Eqs. (1), we obtain a wave equation describing the propagation of sound

in the inhomogeneous medium,

where τ = cht is a normalized time, that makes the velocity of sound in the host medium

ch equal to unity, where ch =

Bh/ρh.

We consider sound beams with harmonic temporal dependence. Then, the steadily os-

p

cillating solution has the form p(r, t) = p(r)eiωτ , which substituted in Eq. (2) leads to the

eigenvalue equation

For the subsequent analysis we consider a concrete geometry, where acoustic waves prop-

agate in a two-dimensional medium, formed by an squared array of solid cylinders, with

axis along y direction and radius r0, in a host ﬂuid medium. The coordinate r in Eq. (3)

depends now on longitudinal (z ) and transverse (x ) directions, and

= (∂/∂x, ∂/∂z) .

The lattice deﬁned though the centers of cylinders is given by the set R =
R = n1a1 + n2a2; n1, n2 ∈

of two-dimensional lattice vectors R that are generated by

A possible way of solving Eq. (3) is by means of the plane wave expansion (PWE) method,

which converts the diﬀerential equation into an inﬁnite matrix eigenvalue problem, which is

then truncated and solved numerically. By solving this eigenvalue problem the frequencies

corresponding to each Bloch wave can be obtained, providing the dispersion relationship

and band structure of the periodic medium.

The bulk modulus and density are periodic functions with the periodicity of the lattice,

and therefore contain all the information of the phononic crystal. This implies that the

material parameters can be represented by their Fourier expansions on the basis of the

reciprocal lattice,

On the other hand, the solutions p(r) of Eq. (3) must be also periodic with the periodicity

of the lattice (Bloch-Floquet theorem), and can be expanded as

where k is a two-dimensional Bloch vector restricted to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, and G

denotes a reciprocal lattice vector. For a square lattice, G = (2π/a)(n1e1 + n2e2) with n1

and n2 integers and a being the lattice constant (minimal distance between the centers of

neighbor cylinders).

The coeﬃcients in expansions (4) and (5) can be obtained from the inverse Fourier trans-

form. For the inverse of mass density the coeﬃcients result9

Equation (9) has been numerically solved considering 361 plane waves in the expansion.

The number of plane waves has been chosen in order to ensure the convergence. Figure

2 shows the band structure for a square lattice of steel cylinders (ρc = 7.8 103 Kg m−3,
Bc = 160 109 N m−2) immersed in water (ρh = 103 Kg m−3, Bh = 2.2 109 N m−2). The

dimensionless (reduced) frequency Ω = ωa/2πch is plotted in terms of the dimensionless

wavenumber of Bloch vector K = ka/2π.

From the solutions of Eq. (9) we can also compute the isofrequency contours. In Fig.

3 the results for the ﬁrst and second bands are shown.

In both cases, the curves show

a transition from convex to concave at a particular frequency. The isofrequency contours

at the transition point acquire, as shown in the ﬁgure, the form of squares with rounded

corners. Consequently, there exist locally ﬂat segments of the curve, where, in other words,

the spreading of the beam will be counteracted by the crystal anisotropy. Similarly as

for photonic crystals in optics the nondiﬀractive propagation occurs along the diagonals of

squares in the ﬁrst propagation band, and along the principal vectors of the lattices in the

second band. The “rounded nondiﬀractive square” is situated around the corner of Brillouin

zone (denoted by M) for the ﬁrst band, and around the centre of Brillouin zone (denoted by

Γ) in the second band.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In order to prove the nondiﬀractive propagation of sound in the sonic crystal, Eqs. (1)

have been numerically integrated using the Finite Diﬀerence in Time Domain (FDTD)

method. FDTD is nowadays a standard technique10 for solving partial diﬀerential equations

by integrating in time, and by approximating the spatial derivatives by ﬁnite diﬀerences.

The incident acoustic beam has been simulated by a plane vibrating surface radiating a har-

monic wave with variable frequency ω, describing an acoustic transducer with a diameter

7

of 3 cm. The front face of the crystal is located close to the source, where the wavefront is

nearly plane. The medium parameters were chosen to correspond to numerically evaluated

zero diﬀraction point (by inspecting the isofrequency curves) in the previous section. For

the ﬁrst band [Fig.3(a)] the isofrequency curve becomes locally ﬂat for Ω

0.54, which

corresponds to a real frequency of f = Ωch/a

154 KHz, and for an incidence along [1,1]

≈

direction. Under these conditions, the nondiﬀractive propagation is predicted to occur. The

result of the numerical simulation for these parameters is shown in Fig. 4 (left column). As

expected, the beam propagates through the crystal without a visible divergence. For the

second band, the theory predicts that the frequency for nondiﬀractive propagation increases

roughly by the factor of √2 with respect to the ﬁrst band, and then occurs at f

217 KHz.

≈

≈

We note that whereas the beam in homogeneous media broadens sensibly over the propa-

gation distance, the same beam in the sonic crystal propagates without sensible broadening

over much longer distances. Diﬀractive broadening in homogeneous medium is quantiﬁed by

the Rayleigh distance Ld = ka2/2, where a is the radius of the source, and corresponds to
the distance from the source after which the beam broadens in a factor of √2. For the two

nondiﬀractive frequencies evaluated above, the Rayleigh distances are 7.3 cm for the ﬁrst

case, and 10.3 cm for the second case.

IV. ANALYTICS FOR NONDIFFRACTING BEAMS

The precise analysis of an arbitrary ﬁeld structure inside the crystal can only be performed

by considering the ﬁeld expansion into an inﬁnite set of modes of the crystal (as stated by

the Bloch theorem). The form given by Eqs. (4)–(6) must be assumed, whose unknown

amplitudes can be numerically evaluated. This is the basics of the PWE method used in

Sec. II for evaluate the band structure and dispersion curves of the crystal. However, it is

possible to develop an analytical theory if we consider the particular case of a nondiﬀractive

beam, since this nondiﬀractive solution appears mainly due to the coupling of three modes,

the homogeneous one and the next low order modes. This situation is illustrated in Fig.5,

where the three intersecting circles, corresponding to the spatial dispersion curves of the

three modes (those with wavenumbers k, k + G1 and k + G2) give rise to the nondiﬀractive

eﬀect. Due to the interaction between the diﬀerent spatial modes the degenerancy at the

intersections of the spatial dispersion curves is lifted, and the ﬂat areas in the dispersion

8

curve can develop. The radiation belonging to these interacting modes is the most relevant

for the deformation of the dispersion curves and to the appearance of the ﬂat segments, i.e.

is responsible for the nondiﬀractive propagation. Therefore the other modes are irrelevant

in the “nondiﬀractive” area (shadowed region in Fig. 5), and the Bloch expansion can be

simpliﬁed as

p(r) =

p0 + p1eiG1·r + p2eiG2·r

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(12c)

where G1 and G2 are the basis vectors of the reciprocal space.

Note that since the nondiﬀractive beam is expected to be highly directive, only G vectors

directed to the same direction as the wavevector k are relevant in the analysis. The material

parameters (being real functions) must be however expanded into at least ﬁve modes. In

particular, the inverses of density and bulk modulus will be assumed of the form

¯ρ(r)−1 =

¯B(r)−1 =

b0 + b+1eiG1·r + b+2eiG2·r + b−1e−iG1·r + b−2e−iG2·r

where the notation ρ±j = ρ±Gj , with j =1,2 has been used. Substituting Eqs. (11) in Eq.

(3), and collecting the terms at the same exponents (those with wavevectors k, k + G1 and

k + G2), we obtain the following coupled equation system,

0 = ω2 (p0b0 + p1b−1 + p2b−2)

Equations (12) are still too complex to lead to analytical results. However, for small

values of the ﬁlling fraction f the solid inclusions can be considered as a perturbation of the

homogeneous ﬂuid medium, and an assymptotic analysis near the bandgap is justiﬁed. Next

we show that, in this limit, it is possible to obtain a simple relation between the frequency

and wavenumber of the nondiﬀractive beam and the ﬁlling fraction f characterizing the

crystal.

First, note that in the case of small f (i.e. when r0 << a) and materials with high-

contrast, where ρh << ρc and Bh << Bc (as occurs, e.g., for steel cylinders in water), the

coeﬃcients of the medium expansions in Eqs. (7) and (8) simplify to ρ0 = b0 = 1

The aim is to obtain the values of ω and k for which the beam propagates without diﬀrac-

tion. For a crystal with square symmetry, the direction of the nondiﬀractive propagation

with respect the crystal axes can be obtained from the isofrequency curves evaluated in Sec.

II. For the ﬁrst band (Figs. 3(a) and 4) nondiﬀractive propagation occurs for beams propa-

gating at 45◦ with respect to the crystal axes, i.e. in the [1,1] direction. For our analysis, is

convenient to consider the beam axis to be coincident with the z direction, and deﬁne a set

of unitary basis vectors as G1 = (

1, 1)/√2, G2 = (1, 1)/√2. In this way, all magnitudes

in reciprocal space are normalized by π/a.

−

For small f, one also expects that the parameters corresponding to the nondiﬀractive

regime take values close to those in the bandgap (near the corner of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone;

see Fig. 2). The wavenumber corresponding to the ﬁrst bandgap is then KB = (0, 1)/√2

(remind that, in normalized reciprocal space, K = ka/2π).

In order to investigate the

behaviour of dispersion curves close to this point, we consider waves with wavevector K =

KB(1

δK) with δK = (δKx, δKz) representing small deviations. We further assume that

−

the frequency is close to- (but less than) that corresponding to the bandgap, Ω = ΩB(1
with the normalized gap frequency given by ΩB = 1/√2.

δΩ),

The solvability condition of Eq. (13) results from equating to zero the determinant of the

matrix, and leads to the relation in the form F (δΩ, δKz, δKx; f ) = 0. Expanding for small

δK = (δKz, δKx), an analytical transversal dispersion relation δKz (δKx) is obtained, which

allows to calculate the diﬀraction coeﬃcient as the curvature of the transverse dispersion

curve, i.e., D = (1/2)∂2δKz/∂δK 2

expression is analytical but still cumbersome. However, assuming that f

Also the wavenumber of the nondiﬀractive beam can be analytically evaluated. Substi-

tuting Eq. (14) in the solvability condition of Eq. (13), and assuming the above smallness

conditions, it follows that,

For the second band, a similar analysis can be performed. The three-mode expansion is

illustrated in Fig. 6. In this case it is more convenient to use the vector basis G1 = (1, 0) and

G2 = (0, 1), and now the nondiﬀractive beam propagation occurs in a direction coincident

with one of the lattice vectors. The parameters of the gap are in this case KB = (1, 0) and

ΩB = 1. An assymptotic analysis similar to that performed above for the ﬁrst band, shows
that δΩ(2)

limit of the weak modulation that f

for both bands are situated equally, however with respect to the corresponding bandgap:

the diﬀraction in the ﬁrst band disappears just below the ﬁrst bangap (by δΩN D = f 2/3),

and in the second band just below the second bandgap by the same value (by δΩN D). The

wavevector shifts are also equal for both cases. As a consequence, Eqs. (14) and (15) are

valid for both bands.

These analytical predictions have been checked numerically. In Fig.7 the analytical re-

sults given by Eqs. (14) and (15) are compared with the corresponding numerical results

(with symbols) obtained with the PWE method using 361 modes. The curve labeled (a)

corresponds to the normalized frequency shift, measured with respect to the bandgap, and

the curve labeled (b) to the wavenumber shift, for zero diﬀraction point in the ﬁrst band

(circles) and the second band (squares). The simple expressions obtained under the three-

mode expansions are in very with good agreement with the numerical results, even for the

moderate (not very small) values of the ﬁlling factor f.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Concluding, we have demonstrated theoretically the possibility of nondiﬀractive propa-

gation of acoustic beams through sonic crystals. We show the nondiﬀractive propagation

for both propagation bands: for the ﬁrst band, where the nondiﬀractive propagation occurs

along the diagonals of the lattice, and for the second band, where diﬀraction disappears

11

along the principal vectors of the lattice. The diﬀraction disappears for frequencies just

below the corresponding bandgaps, with equal frequency shift for both cases given by a

universal and very simple expression: δΩN D = f 2/3.

The other universal relation (15), for the shift of the wavenumber, which in simpliﬁed form

reads δkN D = f 2/3, allows to evaluate the width of the nondiﬀractively propagating beams.

Indeed the half-width of the platoe of spatial dispersion curve is roughly equal to (slightly

less than) δkN D. This means that beams with normalized size d

2π/δkN D ≈

≈

2π f −2/3

can propagate nondiﬀractively over large distances (comparing with the diﬀraction length

of the corresponding beam in the homogeneous materials). In the terms of non-normalized

coordinates, the minimum size of the beam corresponds to d

√2a f −2/3. For a ﬁlling

factor f = 0.114, corresponding to the numerical simulation in Fig. 4, the width of the

nondiﬀractive beam predicted by this expression results d

6a, i.e. to 6 spatial periods of

the lattice. This result is in good agreement with the width of the beam observed in Fig. 4.

FIGURE CAPTIONS

Fig.1. Geometrical interpretation of diﬀraction of waves propagating along the z axis: a)

positive, or normal diﬀraction in propagation through homogeneous materials; b) negative,

or anomalous diﬀraction; c) zero diﬀraction. The area of negligible diﬀraction (for evaluation

of the minimum size of the nondiﬀractive beam) is indicated.

Fig. 2. Band structure for steel cylinders in water, for r = 1 mm, a = 5.25 mm, as calcu-

lated by the expansion into Bloch modes (4)-(7). The solid squares mark the nondiﬀractive

Fig.3 Isofrequency lines, evaluated for a = 5.25 mm and r = 1 mm, for the ﬁrst (a)

and second (b) bands, centered at Γ point, as calculated by the expansion into Bloch modes

points (see Fig.3).

(4)-(7).

Fig.4. Numerical FDTD simulation of the nondiﬀractive beam, for the ﬁrst two bands.

Upper row corresponds to the ﬁeld radiated by the source without crystal, lower row to the

nondiﬀractive propagation in the [1,1] (left) and [1,0] (right) directions, at the frequencies

equal to f = 154 KHz and f = 217 KHz as predicted by the theory. Gray levels are in

decibel scale, and the coordinates in meters. The other parameters are as in Figs. 2 and 3,

i.e. steel cylinders in water are simulated with r = 1 mm and a = 5.25 mm.

Fig. 5. Schematic picture showing the nondiﬀractive region (shadowed area) resulting

from the interaction of three modes. The square represents the limits of the ﬁrst Brillouin

zone. The insert illustrates the lift of the degenerancy at the cross sections of the dispersion

curves and the formation of the Bloch modes. The upper Bloch mode can develop ﬂat

segments depending on the interaction strength, as the degree of the lift of degenerancy is

proportional to the interaction strength.

Fig.6. Schematic picture showing the nondiﬀractive region (shadowed area) in the second

propagation band. Everything as in Fig.5. Here the most relevant modes are k + G1 and

k

G2.

Fig.7. Dependence of the frequency (a) and wavenumber of nondiﬀractive beam, mea-

sured with respect to the bandgap values, as results from numerical calculation (symbols)

and the analytical expressions given in Eqs. (12) and (13). The open circles and squares

correspond to the parameter values used for FDTD calculation of nondiﬀractive propagation

(Fig.4) in the ﬁrst and second band respectively.

If a body in a stream is provided with small ridges aligned in the local ﬂow direction, a remarkable
drag reduction can be reached under turbulent ﬂow conditions. This surprising phenomenon is
called the ’shark skin eﬀect’. We demonstrate, that a reduction of resistance can also be reached in
creeping ﬂows if the ridges are aligned perpendicular to the ﬂow direction. We especially consider
in gravity–driven ﬁlm ﬂows the eﬀect of the bottom topography on the mean transport velocity.

INTRODUCTION

It is yet controversely discussed that the dermal surface
morphology of sharks is in order to improve the sharks’
swimming performance [1]. Nevertheless, it is widely ac-
cepted that for bodies in turbulent ﬂows a reduction of
skin friction by some percent can be reached if the surface
of the body is provided with small ridges aligned in the
local ﬂow direction [2, 3]. This rather counter–intuitional
phenomenon occurs in turbulent ﬂows if the riblet spac-
ing is smaller than the typical diameter of the streamwise
vortices such that the vortices are forced to stay above
the riblets and touch only the tips of the riblets.

The criterion for turbulent ﬂow conditions is based on

the Reynolds number

Re :=

̺U L
η

,

(1)

which gives a comparison between inertial forces and fric-
tion forces. By U and L a characteristic ﬂow velocity and
a characteristic length of the system are denoted, ̺ and
η are the mass density and the dynamic viscosity of the
ﬂuid. At high Reynolds numbers, typically 104 or larger,
the ﬂow is turbulent and vortices are created due to in-
ertia. At small Reynolds number the ﬂow is laminar and
at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers Re ≪ 1 the ﬂow
is creeping. Hence, in creeping ﬂows a ’shark skin eﬀect’
is not expected since inertia–induced vortices are absent.

If the the riblets are aligned perpendicular to the ﬂow
direction, however, kinematically induced vortices can be
created even in creeping ﬂows where inertia is absent [4,
5]. We especially consider a steady, gravity–driven ﬁlm
ﬂow of an incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid on an inclined
plane. The bottom of the inclined plane is provided with
periodic corrugations according to FIG. 1. The mean ﬁlm
thickness is denoted by H, the periodic length by λ and
the mean inclination angle by α. A Cartesian coordinate
system is used with the x–axis placed at the mean level
of the bottom contour, the y–axis in line with the ridges
and the z–axis normal to the mean level of the bottom.

tion b(˜x) as z = b (2πx/λ). Along the bottom the ﬂow
fulﬁlls the no–slip condition

Assuming that the ﬁlm height exceeds the wavelength
of the bottom, the curvature of the free surface can be
neglected [5, 7]. Then, the free surface is given as z = H.

which is the equilibrium between pressure jump at the
surface and viscous forces, has to be fulﬁlled. By ps
the pressure of the surrounding is denoted. If the spa-
tial extensions of the bottom in y–direction are suﬃ-
ciently large, side wall eﬀects can be neglected and a
two–dimensional ﬂow geometry can be assumed. This
allows for a representation of the velocity ﬁeld in terms
of a stream function, i.e.

by which the continuity equation (2) is identically ful-
ﬁlled. Since due to the creeping condition Re ≪ 1 the
inertia terms at left hand of the Navier–Stokes equations
are negligible, EQ. (3) simpliﬁes to the Stokes equations

~0 = −∇p + η∇2~v + ̺~g .

The symbols ℜ and ℑ denote the real and imaginary
part of a complex expression, the prime derivation with
respect to ξ. By inserting the general solution (8, 9) in
the boundary conditions (4, 5), a set of equations for the
boundary values of the two holomorphic functions q(ξ)
and r(ξ) is derived. Due to the periodicity of the ﬂow a
representation of the boundary values of q(ξ) and r(ξ) by
Fourier series can be applied, which leads to an algebraic
set of equations for the series coeﬃcients. After trun-
cating to a ﬁnite number of Fourier modes, its solution
is determined by using computer algebra, e.g. Maple.
The above method and the solving procedure is described
in detail in [5]. For the calculations presented here the
series have been truncated at the mode number where
the values of the coeﬃcients fall below 10−10. This leads
to truncation orders between 12 and 36.

by three diﬀerent trigonometric polynomials as shown in
FIG. 2. At ﬁrst, we consider a harmonic contour, i.e.

b1(˜x) = −A cos ˜x ,

with amplitude A as a comparatively smooth shape. In
contrast to this, by the third order trigonometric poly-
nomial

an array of peaks is given. Since the derivatives of b3(˜x)
up to the 5th order vanish, a ﬂat region between the
peaks becomes apparent. The parameter A is again the
amplitude, in the sense that b3(π) − b3(0) = 2A. The

case b3(˜x). Note, that the derivatives of b10(˜x) vanish
up to the 19th derivative. Therefore, b10(˜x) is a good
approximation for the idealised array of brush–like peaks
by a continuous bottom shape.

RESULTS

Streamlines and vortex creation

Bottom shapes

For the modelling of wall roughness Panton [8] sug-
gests a ’brush model’, i.e. an inﬁnite array of equidistant

Streamline patterns have been calculated for various
shapes, amplitudes and ﬁlm heights. For small ampli-
tudes the streamlines follow the bottom contour, whereas
ﬂow separation is observed if the amplitude exceeds a
critical limit. As representative examples in FIG. 3 the

The quantity Ht, subsequently called the mean trans-
port thickness, has to be understood as mean thickness
of the part of the ﬂow which contributes to the material
transport, i.e.
If
the separatrix of the primary vortex is given as z = s(x),
x1 ≤ x ≤ x2, the mean transport thickness results in

the ﬁlm above the separation areas.

The quantity Ht has to be carefully distinguished from
the mean geometrical ﬁlm thickness H of the entire ﬁlm
which includes the vortices. Furthermore, by

(17)

the reference thickness of a ﬁlm ﬂow on a plane bottom
with the same ﬂow rate as the ﬂow over the topography
is deﬁned [5]. The three quantities H0, H and Ht are
illustrated in FIG. 4. Thus, for a ﬁxed ﬂow rate ˙V , the
comparison of the mean transport thickness Ht with the
reference thickness H0 delivers an adequate measure for
enhancement or reduction of the mean transport velocity
in the ﬁlm: In case of Ht > H0, the mean transport veloc-
ity is reduced, whereas Ht < H0 indicates enhancement
of ut.

In FIG. 5 the relative ﬁlm elevation (Ht − H0)/H0
is plotted versus the amplitude A for the three diﬀer-
ent bottom contours b1, b3 and b10. This parameter
study has been carried out with a ﬁxed ﬂow rate of
˙V = 9̺gλ3 sin α/(8η), corresponding to a reference thick-
ness of H0 = 3λ/2. Additionally, the onset of primary
and further ﬂow separation is indicated in the diagram.

FIG. 3: Near–bottom streamlines of ﬁlm ﬂows over the
shape b10 with amplitude (a) A = 0.17λ and (b) A = 0.5λ.

streamlines in the vicinity of the bottom are presented
for the shape b10 with two diﬀerent amplitudes, namely
A = 0.17λ and A = 0.5λ. The ﬁlm heights, H = 1.70λ in
(a) and H = 2.24λ in (b), are chosen in order to receive
the same ﬂow rate in both cases.

The critical amplitude for the primary ﬂow separa-
tion is A ≈ 0.107λ. Thus, in FIG. 3a ﬂow separation
is already apparent: A vortex pair has been created at
the positions of maximum curvature. With increasing
amplitude the vortices are growing, which leads to the
merging of the two vortices to a single one. Such a case
with a large single vortex which covers the major part
of the region between two neighbouring peaks is shown
in FIG. 3b. In this example we especially see a slightly
curved separatrix passing nearly from tip to tip. This
feeds the hope of a probable resistance reduction, since
the vortices are supposed to act like ’ﬂuid roller bearings’.
By increasing the amplitude further, a secondary vortex
pair is created at the critical amplitude A ≈ 0.606λ for
secondary ﬂow separation.

tom topography on the material transport in a creep-
ing ﬁlm ﬂow: For the shapes b1 and b3 we found a de-
crease of the mean transport velocity compared to the
ﬂow over a plane bottom, whereas for the shape b10 with
the sharpest peaks an increase of the mean transport ve-
locity becomes apparent at suﬃciently high amplitude.
Thus, a comparison to the ’shark skin eﬀect’, which has
been successfully applied to ships and airplanes for drag
reduction, is near at hand. The present eﬀect, however,
is essentially diﬀerent from the popular shark skin eﬀect:
The increase of the mean transport velocity has been cal-
culated for creeping ﬂows, whereas the shark skin eﬀect
occurs in turbulent ﬂow at Reynolds numbers ≈ 104–106.
Furthermore, the rippled structures of the shark skin are
directed longitudinal to the ﬂow, not transversal as it is
the case here. Finally, the responsible mechanism for the
shark skin eﬀect is according to [9] and [3] the control
of the streamwise vortices in the turbulent ﬂow, which
has been created by inertia. In contrast to this, the rip-
pled bottom structure in creeping ﬁlm ﬂows enforce the
creation of vortices which act on the ﬂow like a kind of
’ﬂuid roller bearing’. Nevertheless, a common feature of
the shark skin eﬀect and the eﬀect observed in the present
paper is the reduction of resistance in the ﬂow by means
of rippled wall structures.

The highest relative increase of the mean transport
velocity is in our calculations 0.88%. This is less than
the shark skin eﬀect in turbulent ﬂow, which is supposed
to be at most 10% [3]. It is an open question up to which
extend the value of 0.88% can be improved by varying
the relevant parameters, especially the bottom shape.

FIG. 5: Relative ﬁlm elevation vs. amplitude of ﬂows over
diﬀerent shapes.

From the beginning up to an amplitude of about λ/6,
the ﬁlm elevation is monotonously increasing for all three
diﬀerent shapes, which indicates a reduction of the mean
transport velocity due to the bottom corrugations. Note,
that within this parameter regime no positive eﬀect can
be expected since no vortices are present. However, the
curves reach maxima slightly after the primary vortex
generation and pass then into a monotonous decrease
due to reduction of friction by vortices, which act like
ﬂuid roller bearings. Obviously, both the height of the
maximum as well as the decrease after the vortex genera-
tion are more pronounced for bottom shapes with sharper
peaks. For the curve associated to the bottom b10 the
ﬁlm elevation becomes negative for high amplitudes, i.e.
the mean transport velocity exceeds the corresponding
mean transport velocity of the ﬂow over a plane bottom.
At the highest amplitude considered in our calculations,
A = 0.9λ, this enhancement of the mean transport ve-
locity reaches 0.88%.

The increase of the mean transport velocity indicates
an improved mass transport in the volume. In contrast
to this, the surface velocity remains nearly unchanged.

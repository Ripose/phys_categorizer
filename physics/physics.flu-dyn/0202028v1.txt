Abstrat

A proposal for a alulational program in (cid:29)uid turbulene is pre-

sented. A turbulent environment is here, as is widely aepted, pro-

posed to be a ondition of the system for whih the time and spae

evolution of the dynamial variables are haoti, but for whih a sta-

tistial distribution is appliable. The time-evolution of an initially

given probability distribution funtion for the dynamial variables is

given by the deterministi evolution equations that govern the sys-

tem, alled deterministi haos. A (cid:29)uid environment is a dynamial

system, having energy input mehanisms at long distane sales our-

ring on the spatial boundaries and energy dissipation mehanisms due

to visosity ourring on small distane sales. Hene, the (cid:29)uid has an

attrator, alled the Strange Attrator in the turbulent regime, for its

dynamial variables. It is proposed here that the (cid:29)uid probability den-

sity funtional also has an attrator for its time-evolution. The same

mehanism that auses the dynamial variables to have an attrator in

phase spae, that is the tendeny for the equilibration of energy input

rates and energy output rates to set in, also auses an arbitrary initial

statistis to evolve toward an attrating statistis, whih is stationary

in time. It is this stationary statistis that allow the Kolmogorov sal-

ing ideas to have appliability. The term (cid:16)full turbulene" here applies

1

to the dynamial system having reahed its attrator. The evolution

of the (cid:29)uid's statistis an be set up as a spae-time path integral.

Ensemble averages of any dynamial variable an be formulated in

terms of this path integral. Fluid spae-time on(cid:28)guration sampling

tehniques naturally suggest a useful way, using an arbitrary initial

statistis funtional, to alulate these averages.

1 Desription of the Proposed Mathe-

matial Program for Fluid Turbulene

Let us set up the evolution equations for inompressible (cid:29)uid dynamis.

The extension of the proposal to be desribed to ompressible (cid:29)uid

dynamis will pose no unusual di(cid:30)ulty.

We have,

d(ρ~v)
dt

= ~f + η

2~v,

∇

where

~f is an external fore density, suh as due to the salar pressure
(cid:28)eld, and η is the oe(cid:30)ient of visosity. ~v is the (cid:29)uid veloity (cid:28)eld.

We also have,

Here, ρ is the mass density of the (cid:29)uid. If ρ = a onstant, then

(ρ~v) +

= 0.

We drop the external fore density in what follows. (This is not

an essential step. What are needed are a set of interating (cid:28)elds, not

neessarily restrited to being veloity (cid:28)elds, together with station-

ary boundary onditions to allow the deterministi time-evolution of

2

the set.) We assoiate with the veloity (cid:28)eld a probability density

funtional, ρ[v, t]. This (cid:29)uid statistis time-evolves aording to deter-

ministi haos [1℄ [2℄.

ρ[vf , tf ] =

d[v0]K[vf , tf ; v0, t0]ρ[v0, t0],

Z

where the kernel K[v, t, ; v0, t0] is given by the delta funtional,

K[vf , tf ; v0, t0] = δ[vf −

vclassical[tf ; v0, t0]].

That is, the number, ρ, assoiated with the veloity (cid:28)eld v0 at time t0
will be assoiated with vf at time tf , where vf is the veloity (cid:28)eld v0
deterministially evolves into from time t0 .

The veloity (cid:28)eld has an attrator, determined by the stationary

boundary onditions on the (cid:29)uid. When the boundary onditions allow

laminar (cid:29)ow to beome established, the attrator onsists of a single

veloity (cid:28)eld. Although there is only one veloity (cid:28)eld in this attrator,

this is still a non-equilibrium situation. At equilibrium, the intensive

variable of veloity would be uniform throughout the medium. When

the Reynolds number beomes large enough, bifurations set in, or the

onset of instability ours, and the attrator begins to onsist of more

than one veloity (cid:28)eld. This instability is presumably due to the non-

linear term in the Navier-Stokes evolution equations, whih indues

a frequeny mode-mode oupling, allowing zero-frequeny energy to

go into non-zero frequenies. In the turbulent regime, the attrator

onsists of many veloity (cid:28)elds, and the (cid:29)uid aesses these veloity

(cid:28)elds in a haphazard fashion.

Given a funtional of the spatial veloity (cid:28)eld, A[v], we will say

that its ensemble average when the (cid:29)uid is at full turbulene is,

< A[v] >= lim

The funtional integration is over all spae-time veloity (cid:28)elds within

the spatial system, between times t0 and tf . Also, ˙v = f [v] is equation
(1). ρ[v0, t0] is an arbitrary probability density funtional that is non-

zero only for veloity (cid:28)elds that are divergeneless and that satisfy

the spatial boundary onditions on the (cid:29)uid environment. The term

but the approximation gets better as one inreases the lattie (cid:28)neness,

beause we are operating within a (cid:28)nite spae-time volume. Clearly,

a good approximation to the attrating statistis as a starting point

will shorten the evolution time required for aurate results. The path

integral (3) an be evaluated with Monte Carlo tehniques utilizing

importane sampling.

2 Summary

We have said that the time evolution of the statistis also has an

attrator for seven reasons;

1. It is a way to get a solution to the problem of arriving at the

(cid:16)turbulene statistis." One knows that the turbulene statistis

is stationary with respet to its time-evolver. Proposing that

this statistis is the attrator of its time-evolver means one does

not have to (cid:16)have the statistis to get the statistis," thereby

o(cid:27)ering a solution to the (cid:16)losure problem" for the determination

of orrelation funtions.

2. The statistial physis approah is the only feasible way of ob-

taining alulational results for deterministi systems with many

degrees of freedom.

3. The statistial physis approah is onsidered to be a method of

feasibility, just as renormalization in quantum (cid:28)eld theory is on-

sidered to be a method of feasibility for obtaining alulational

results. Just as unrenormalized quantum (cid:28)eld theory is (cid:16)the the-

ory" for whih attempts to diretly take it and do alulations

with it leads one to feasibility problems suh as ritial slowing

down in the lattie (cid:28)eld theory approah and divergenes in the

perturbative (cid:28)eld theory approah, diret alulations of deter-

ministi systems with many degrees of freedom leads to feasibility

roadbloks. There are simply too many deterministi variables.

4. The statistial physis approah has been suessful in equilib-

rium thermodynamis where the derivation of the miroanonial

ensemble an be taken as the indiation that equilibrium is the

attrator for the dynamial system when the boundary ondi-

tions on the system input no energy. In the attrator, the mean

energy input is equilibrated with the mean energy output, both

being zero. This leads to the miroanonial ensemble, beause

in the attrator dissipative losses have e(cid:27)etively shut o(cid:27), and

the system beomes e(cid:27)etively Hamiltonian. The stationarity of

the statistis requires the vanishing of the Poisson braket of the

statistis with this Hamiltonian resulting in the statistis of equal

a priori probability.

5. The dynamial system, of whih a (cid:29)uid is an example, has an

attrator [3℄. The dynamis of the statistial approah should

5

mirror the dynamis of the atual dynamial system, whih has

an attrator, a dynamial attrator it may be alled.

6. The statistis of the dynamial system prior to (cid:16)full turbulene,"

that is prior to the dynamial system having reahed its attrator,

is not unique. The statistis of the attrator is unique, in whih

the geometry of the system, the stationary boundary onditions,

and the visosities, all of whih determine the Reynolds number,

play a ruial role in determining the attrator.

7. The stationary statistis of the (cid:29)uid ours when the equilibra-

tion of energy input and energy output has set in [4℄.

3 Conlusions

In the disretized version of the path integral for the stationary statis-

tis, this statistis annot be absolutely reahed. Instead, the statistis

one arrives at, in the limit of long time evolution, osillates around the

true attrating statistis. The true attrator is arrived at in the on-

tinuum limit of the path integral. However, the ontinuum limit an

be approahed sine one is working with a (cid:28)nite spae- time volume.

We have now hit upon a general idea for non-equilibrium thermo-

dynamis . It is the situation where a dynamial system has reahed

an attrator for whih the boundary onditions input energy, and the

input energy rates has equilibrated with the output energy rate, both

rates being non-zero.

The boundary onditions on the (cid:29)uid input energy, typially at

large distane sales. The visosities, through visous shear in the

(cid:29)uid, output energy, typially at small distane sales. In the attrator,

the equilibration of the mean energy input rate and the mean energy

output rate has beome established. This beomes the bakdrop for

Kolmogorov's ideas of self-similarity and the resulting saling relations.

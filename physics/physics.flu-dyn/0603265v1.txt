(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The description of free surface ﬂows can often be simpliﬁed to thin ﬁlm (or lubrication) equations,
when the slopes of the liquid-gas interface are small. Here we present a long wavelength theory
that remains fully quantitative for steep interface slopes, by expanding about Stokes ﬂow in a
wedge. For small capillary numbers, the variations of the interface slope are slow and can be
treated perturbatively. This geometry occurs naturally for ﬂows with contact lines: we quantify the
diﬀerence with ordinary lubrication theory through a numerical example and analytically recover
the full Cox-Voinov asymptotic solution.

Free surface ﬂows are encountered in many everyday
life and industrial situations, ranging from soap ﬁlms,
sliding drops to paints and coatings [1, 2]. The hydrody-
namic description of these ’free boundary problems’ still
provides a challenge of great fundamental and techno-
logical interest. The diﬃculty lies in the intricate cou-
pling between the liquid-gas interface and the ﬂow inside
the ﬁlm, which gives rise to a broad variety of insta-
bilities and interface morphologies [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In
the case of ’thin’ ﬁlms, for which horizontal and vertical
length scales are well separated (Fig. 1a), the problem
is greatly reduced through a long wavelength expansion
[2, 8, 9]. At low Reynolds numbers this so-called lubrica-
tion approximation yields a single nonlinear equation for
the evolution of the interface proﬁle h(x, y, t), and forms
the accepted theoretical framework for free surface ﬂows.
This reduction is possible whenever surface tension (γ)
dominates over viscosity (η), so that the capillary num-
ber Ca = ηU ∗/γ serves as a small parameter; U ∗ denotes
the velocity scale of the problem.

The standard formulation of lubrication theory, how-
it is only valid for small
ever, has a severe drawback:
interface slopes, i.e.
1. While it is generally
| ≪
believed that the lubrication equation yields good qual-
itative predictions for larger slopes as well, one has to
be careful with quantitative comparisons. This is par-
ticularly important for the problem of moving contact
lines for which viscous forces tend to diverge as h
0
[10, 11]. The microscopic mechanisms that release this
singularity are highly disputed [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], and
call for a fully quantitive description of experiments that
often involve large contact angles. As it is practically
infeasible to resolve the full hydrodynamic problem on
all relevant length scales, ranging from molecular to mil-
limetric, a simpliﬁed theory for ﬁnite slopes would be
extremely valuable.

→

In this paper we present a generalization of the lubrica-
tion theory for free surface ﬂows at low Reynolds numbers
that remains exact for large slopes. The crucial observa-
tion is that in the limit of small Ca, capillary driving
requires slow variations of the interface curvature, but
there are no restrictions to the steepness of the interface.

FIG. 1:
(a) The usual lubrication approximation is valid
whenever the liquid-gas interface is slowly varying along the
horizontal coordinates, and is thus restricted to small slopes.
(b) Considering wedge-like proﬁles with slowly varying slope
θ(x), we derive the long wavelength theory for steep slopes.

We therefore consider the ﬂow in a wedge with a ﬁnite,
but slowly varying opening angle θ – see Fig. 1b. This
geometry naturally occurs for contact lines. Treating the
variation as a perturbation around a straight wedge then
yields the equation for the interface proﬁle h(x, y, t).

This theory, summarized by Eqs. (14,15), remains fully
quantitative for large slopes when the curvature κ
1/h,
while it enjoys the same mathematical structure as the
usual lubrication theory. We furthermore show that the
equation reproduces the asymptotics for θ(x) as com-
puted by Voinov [12] and Cox [13], in a relatively straight-
forward manner. However, the present work reaches be-
yond asymptotic relations: it describes all intermediate
length scales as well, and allows to incorporate other
forces such as a disjoining pressure or gravity.

Lubrication theory for free surface ﬂows – Before ad-
dressing the problem of ﬁnite slopes, let us ﬁrst brieﬂy
revisit the lubrication approximation. In the limit of zero

liquids is described by Stokes equations

where p(x, y, z) and v(x, y, z) represent the pressure and
velocity ﬁeld respectively, while we consider body forces
that derive from a potential Φ. (Time dependent proﬁles
will be discussed below.) The equation is complemented
with the boundary condition of Laplace pressure at the
free surface

p(z = h) = p0

γκ,

(3)

where κ is the interface curvature. This gives rise to
an intricate nonlinear coupling between the shape of the
interface and the ﬂow inside the ﬁlm, which has to be
resolved self-consistently. We limit the discussion to the
case where the gas is hydrodynamically passive and we
take a zero shear stress condition at the free interface.

≪

In the limit where Ca

1, the free boundary problem
can be greatly reduced through the lubrication approxi-
mation: surface tension is suﬃciently strong to drive the
viscous ﬂow through only minor variations of the shape
of the free surface (Fig. 1a). One thus expects that the
interface proﬁle and the velocity ﬁeld are slow functions
of the horizontal coordinates, so that

All lengths have been rescaled by the typical ﬁlm thick-
ness h∗, and ǫ = Ca
is the small parameter of the
expansion. The strategy is to solve Eqs. (1-3) order by
order in ǫ. Here we brieﬂy sketch the approach; for a
more detailed derivation we refer to [2].

If we let ǫ go to zero, the departure of h(x, y) from a
horizontal interface becomes increasingly small. Hence,
the velocity proﬁle converges towards the parabolic
(Poiseuille-like) proﬁle in this limit, so that

Formally, this dominant ﬂow can be obtained from

In deriving Eq. (6) we used the boundary conditions

Since the dominant viscous forces in Eq. (2) arise from
˜v0, we do not need to solve for the higher order veloc-

it provides the common theoretical framework for free
surface ﬂows, both in the scientiﬁc community as well as
for industrial purposes. The lowest order terms that are
neglected are of order ǫ2, so the expansion is valid in the
limit of small slopes,

Theory for large slopes – We now perform a simi-
lar long wavelength expansion for wedge-like geometries,
such as depicted in Fig. 1b. The crucial physical ingredi-
ent underlying the expansion is that surface tension dom-

inates over viscosity, i.e. Ca
interface curvature are slow with respect to the relevent
length scales. In principle there is no restriction to the
slope of the interface: the only requirement is that the
opening angle θ is slowly varying (Fig. 1b). We therefore
consider proﬁles with

and perform an expansion in ǫ. Note that ˜θ itself is of or-

is a typical distance to the ’origin’ of the wedge – we show
below that the analysis remains self-consistent as long as
h ∂xθ

proﬁles so we omit the y-dependence.

In the spirit of the lubrication approximation, we ex-

pand the velocity as

v(x, z) = ˜v0 + ǫ ˜v1 + ǫ2 ˜v2 +

(10)

and solve for the dominant ﬂow ˜v0. Again, ˜v0 is obtained
in the limit ǫ
0, which in this case corresponds to a
wedge of constant opening angle. Hence, the problem for
˜v0 reduces to Stokes ﬂow inside a straight wedge, which
is easily solved analytically [10, 17].

→

To make this more explicit, we introduce local cylin-
drical coordinates, r(x, z) and φ(x, z), which are deﬁned
by the locally tangent wedge (Fig. 2a)

The x-dependence appears through h(x) and θ(x). Writ-
ing the velocity as a function of these coordinates

v(x, z) = ˜v (r(x, z) , φ(x, z))

(11)

and expanding Eqs. (1,2), one indeed ﬁnds that the order
ǫ0 reduces to the problem of a straight wedge: variations
of θ show up at higher orders. For the dominant ﬂow we
can thus use the results of [10, 17],

which hold in the frame comoving with the interface.
This ﬂow has been sketched in Fig. 2b. Here we used
the conditions of a vanishing shear stress at φ = 0 and
a no-slip condition at the plate, vr =
U . The latter
condition ensures that U represents the depth-averaged
velocity in the frame attached to the plate.

Comparing this result to the lubrication equation (7),
one observes two diﬀerences. First, the function F (θ) can
in-
be seen as a correction factor for the viscous term:
deed, one recovers F (θ)
1 for small slopes. Second, the
left hand side of Eq. (14) now involves the full curvature

κ =

(16)

The expansion thus provides an equation for the inter-
face proﬁle that has the same mathematical structure as
the usual lubrication approximation, but which remains
exact for large slopes. The lowest order terms that are
(x∗∂xθ), so the expansion
neglected are of order ǫ =
1. This does not mean that the
is valid when h∂xθ
description is limited to small heights: the height only
appears as a reference scale to quantify the dimension-
less curvature.

Asymptotics for θ(x)

– To illustrate the strength of
the approach, we now show that Eq. (14) correctly re-
produces the nontrivial asymptotic solution for θ(x), as
obtained by Voinov [12] and Cox [13] for advancing con-
tact lines. Anticipating the well known result, we express
the relation between θ and x as

g(θ) = Ca ln(x/x0),

(17)

and solve for g(θ) using Eq. (14) with Φ = 0. Diﬀerenti-
ating g(θ) with respect to x one ﬁnds ∂xθ = Ca/(xg′), so
that the curvature can be written as κ = Ca cos θ/(x g′).
Combining this with the expansion h(x) = x tan θ(x) +

(Ca), Eq. (14) becomes to lowest order

Discussion – We have derived the long wavelength
expansion for free surface ﬂows in the case of steep in-
terface proﬁles. This provides a signiﬁcant improve-
ment with respect to the usual lubrication approxima-
tion, whose validity is restricted to small slopes. The
resulting theory has the same mathematical structure as
the lubrication equation and is thus easily adapted to
existing codes and methods. The most natural applica-
tion of our work is found in wetting ﬂows that involve
large contact angles. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, where
we computed the thickness of a ﬂat ﬁlm ﬂowing down a
vertical plate in the presence of a receding contact line.
ρgx,
The eﬀect of gravity is accounted for through Φ =
−
which introduces the capillary length scale lγ =
γ/ρg.
For a given thickness hﬁlm = lγ√3Ca, there is a unique
solution that connects to the contact line [18]. By nu-
merically solving the interface proﬁle down to a micro-
scopic (molecular) height h0, we can thus identify the
slope very close to the contact line, denoted by the an-
gle θ0 [19]. This yields a unique relation between the
slope imposed at a microscopic distance from the con-
tact line and the macroscopic ﬁlm thickness. The results
obtained from numerical integration of Eq. (14) (solid)
displays signiﬁcant quantitative diﬀerences with the pre-
30◦.

Although in principle the expansion is not limited to
contact lines, steep slopes are typically attained through
curvatures hh′′
1 in ﬂows without contact lines. This
lies beyond the strict validity of the expansion and one
expects corrections due to curvature of the interface.
These corrections can in principle be treated perturba-
tively as well, since Ca
1 implies weak variations of
curvature.

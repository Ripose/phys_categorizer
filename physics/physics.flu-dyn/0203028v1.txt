The probability density function (PDF) of velocity ﬂuctuations is studied experimentally for grid
turbulence in a systematical manner. At small distances from the grid, where the turbulence is
still developing, the PDF is sub-Gaussian. At intermediate distances, where the turbulence is fully
developed, the PDF is Gaussian. At large distances, where the turbulence has decayed, the PDF is
hyper-Gaussian. The Fourier transforms of the velocity ﬂuctuations always have Gaussian PDFs.
At intermediate distances from the grid, the Fourier transforms are statistically independent of each
other. This is the necessary and suﬃcient condition for Gaussianity of the velocity ﬂuctuations. At
small and large distances, the Fourier transforms are dependent.

INTRODUCTION

While velocity diﬀerences in turbulence u(x + δx) − u(x) have attracted much interest, velocity ﬂuctuations u(x)
themselves are also fundamental to describing the turbulence. Usually it is observed that the probability density
function (PDF) of the velocity ﬂuctuations is close to Gaussian [1, 2]. However, some experiments yield a sub-
Gaussian PDF [3, 4, 5], which has a less pronounced tail than a Gaussian PDF. The reason remains controversial
because there have been no systematical studies.

The observed Gaussianity had been explained by applying the cental limit theorem to the Fourier transformation of
the velocity ﬂuctuations [1]. This theorem ensures that a sum of many independent random variables has a Gaussian
PDF [6]. However, owing to the steep energy spectrum of turbulence, the Fourier transforms have considerably
diﬀerent magnitudes. In this case, the central limit theorem is not applicable [5]. We ﬁrst reconsider the condition
for the velocity ﬂuctuations to have a Gaussian PDF (Sec. II).

For studies of velocity ﬂuctuations, an experimental approach is preferable to the popular direct numerical simula-
tion. Although the direct numerical simulation is useful in studying small-scale motions of turbulence, they are not of
our interest because the velocity ﬂuctuations are dominated by energy-containing large-scale motions. Those in the
direct numerical simulation suﬀer from its artiﬁcial boundary condition, initial condition, and forcing.

We obtain experimental data of velocity ﬂuctuations in a wind tunnel downstream of a turbulence-generating grid
(Sec. III). The grid turbulence is not homogeneous in the mean-wind direction and thus allows us to study developing,
fully developed, and decayed states of turbulence by increasing the distance between the anemometer and the grid.
We ﬁnd that the PDF of velocity ﬂuctuations changes accordingly from a sub-Gaussian to Gaussian, and to hyper-
Gaussian (Sec. IV). Here a hyper-Gaussian PDF has a more pronounced tail than a Gaussian PDF. We discuss the
observed behavior by using the velocity ﬂuctuations themselves, the velocity diﬀerences, and the Fourier transforms.

The Fourier transforms an(u) and bn(u) for n ≫ 1 have Gaussian PDFs over the realizations [7] (see also Ref. [8] for

The above discussion is not applicable to the Fourier transforms an(u) and bn(u) for n ≃ 1, i.e., those for large
wavelengths. Nevertheless, as far as the wavelength is ﬁnite, it is possible to show Gaussianity of the corresponding
Fourier transform by increasing the data length L and hence the n value. In the limit L → ∞, the transforms an(u)
and bn(u) for n ≃ 1 become zero and do not contribute to the velocity ﬂuctuations u(x). We are able to assume
safely that all the Fourier transforms have Gaussian PDFs. Since this fact is independent of detailed dynamics, it is
universal.

R

If and only if all the Fourier transforms an(u) and bn(u) are statistically independent of each other, the Gaussianity
of them leads to Gaussianity of the velocity ﬂuctuations u(x). To demonstrate this, we use the characteristic functions
n (τ ) and φ(b)

Here En cos2(2πnx/L) and En sin2(2πnx/L) are the variances of an(u) cos(2πnx/L) and bn(u) sin(2πnx/L). From
the expansion formula (1) and the independence of the Fourier transforms an(u) and bn(u), it follows that the sum
of the logarithms of the characteristic functions φ(a)
n (τ ) and φ(b)
n (τ ) is equal to the logarithm of the characteristic
function φ(τ ) for the PDF of the velocity ﬂuctuations u(x):

Thus the velocity ﬂuctuations u(x) have a Gaussian PDF with the variance hu(x)2i =

of the Fourier transforms also leads to the statistical independence of the velocity ﬂuctuations u(x) at diﬀerent spatial
positions.

P

Therefore, the necessary and suﬃcient condition for the velocity ﬂuctuations to have a Gaussian PDF is the
independence of the Fourier transforms. This is a good approximation for fully developed turbulence, where large-
scale motions of energy-containing eddies are random and independent. Although turbulence contains small-scale
coherent structures such as vortex tubes [9], their importance to the velocity ﬂuctuations is negligible, i.e., being as
small as the energy ratio of the dissipation range to the energy-containing range.

The experiments were done in two wind tunnels of Meteorological Research Institute. Their test sections were of
0.8 × 0.8 × 3 and 3 × 2 × 18 m in size (hereafter, respectively, the small and large tunnels). The small tunnel was

used to study developing and fully developed states of grid turbulence, while the large tunnel was used to study fully
developed and decayed states.

Turbulence was produced by placing a grid across the entrance to the test section. The grid consisted of two layers
of uniformly spaced rods, the axes of which were perpendicular to each other. We used diﬀerent grids in the small
and large tunnels. The separation of the axes of their adjacent rods were 0.10 and 0.40 m, respectively. The cross
sections of the rods were 0.02 × 0.02 and 0.06 × 0.06 m, respectively. The mean wind was set to be U ≃ 10 m s−1 in
the small tunnel and U ≃ 20 m s−1 in the large tunnel.

We simultaneously measured the streamwise (U + u) and transverse (v) velocities. They are velocity components
that are parallel and perpendicular to the mean-wind direction, respectively. The measurements in the small tunnel
were done on the tunnel axis from d = 0.25 to 2.00 m downstream of the grid with an interval of 0.25 m. Those in the
large tunnel were done from d = 3.00 to 17.00 m with an interval of 1.00 m. The ranges of the measurement positions
were to the limit of mechanical constraints of the wind tunnels. Since there was no overlap in the distance d between
the small- and large-tunnel measurements, the individual data are identiﬁed by their d values.

We used a hot-wire anemometer, which was composed of a crossed-wire probe and a constant temperature system.
The wires were 5 µm in diameter, 1.25 mm in eﬀective length, 1.25 mm in separation, and oriented at ±45◦ to the
mean-wind direction. The wire temperature was 280◦C, while the air temperature was 29–30◦C in the small tunnel
and 14–19◦C in the large tunnel. We calibrated the anemometer before and after the measurements.

The signal was low-pass ﬁltered with 24 dB/octave and sampled digitally with 16-bit resolution. In the small-wind
measurements, the ﬁltering was at 8 kHz and the sampling was at 16 kHz.
In the large-wind measurements, the
ﬁltering was at 20 kHz and the sampling was at 40 kHz. The entire length of the signal was as long as 5 × 106 points.
We obtained longer data of 2 × 107 points at the positions d = 0.25, 2.00, 8.00, and 12.00 m.

The turbulence levels, i.e., the ratios of the root-mean-square values of the velocity ﬂuctuations hu2i1/2 and hv2i1/2
to the mean streamwise velocity U , were always low (<
∼ 0.2; see below). This is a good characteristic of grid turbulence
and allows us to rely on the frozen-eddy hypothesis of Taylor, ∂/∂t = −U ∂/∂x, which converts temporal variations
into spatial variations in the mean-wind direction.

The resultant spatial resolution is comparable to the probe size, ∼ 1 mm. Since the probe is larger than the
Kolmogorov length, 0.1–0.2 mm, the smallest-scale motions of the ﬂow were ﬁltered out. The present resolution is
nevertheless typical of hot-wire anemometry [2, 4, 10, 11, 12].

Fig. 1 shows the mean streamwise velocity U , the root-mean-square ﬂuctuations hu2i1/2 and hv2i1/2, the correlation
lengths lu and lv, the Taylor microscale λ = (hu2i/h(∂u/∂x)2i)1/2, and the turbulence levels hu2i1/2/U and hv2i1/2/U .
For these and the other similar diagrams, open symbols denote the streamwise velocity while ﬁlled symbols denote
the transverse velocity. The ﬂow parameters change systematically with the distance from the grid, indicating a
systematical change of the turbulence. This is especially the case in the turbulence levels. Our following studies suggest

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Overview

Fig. 2 demonstrates that Fourier transforms of the velocity ﬂuctuations have Gaussian PDFs at the positions
d = 0.25, 2.00, 8.00, and 12.00 m. The individual data were divided into 4864 segments of 212 points, which were
regarded as independent realizations of the turbulence. They were windowed by a ﬂat-topped function, which rises
from zero to unity in the ﬁrst small fraction of the data and falls back to zero in the last small fraction. The PDFs
shown in Fig. 2 are those for the wave number k = n/L = 7 m−1, where the energy spectra at d = 0.25 m have a peak
(see below). Since the PDFs of an and bn should be the same, they were put together in order to minimize statistical
uncertainties. We also obtained Gaussian PDFs of the Fourier transforms at the other wave numbers and at the other
positions in the wind tunnels.

However, velocity ﬂuctuations do not necessarily have Gaussian PDFs. Fig. 3 shows the PDFs at the positions
d = 0.25, 2.00, 8.00, and 12.00 m. The transverse-velocity PDF is sub-Gaussian at d = 0.25 m, Gaussian at d = 2.00
and 8.00 m, and hyper-Gaussian at d = 12.00 m. The streamwise-velocity PDF tends to be skewed owing to a shear
ﬂow.

Fig. 4 shows the ﬂatness factors Fu = hu4i/hu2i2 and Fv, the skewness factor Su = hu3i/hu2i3/2, and the streamwise-
transverse correlation Cuv = (hu2v2i − hu2ihv2i)/[(hu4i − hu2i2)(hv4i − hv2i2)]1/2. With an increase of the distance
from the grid, the transverse-velocity PDF changes from sub-Gaussian (F < 3) to Gaussian (F = 3), and to hyper-
Gaussian (F > 3). The streamwise-velocity PDF tends to be skewed (S 6= 0) and changes from hyper-Gaussian to

4

Gaussian, and to hyper-Gaussian. Also at large distances from the grid, the streamwise and transverse velocities have
a signiﬁcant correlation (Cuv ≫ 0).

Since the streamwise ﬂuctuations suﬀer from a shear, we are interested mainly in the transverse ﬂuctuations. Their

sub-Gaussian, Gaussian, and hyper-Gaussian PDFs are studied separately in the following subsections.

B. Sub-Gaussian PDF in developing turbulence

The transverse velocity has a sub-Gaussian PDF at the smallest distance from the grid, d = 0.25 m (Figs. 3 and
4). Fig. 5(a) shows energy spectra of the streamwise and transverse velocities. They have peaks at the wave numbers
k ≃ 7 and 14 m−1. The ﬂow is in a transition state from quasi-periodic motions due to wavy wakes of the grid rods to
weak turbulence. Fig. 5(b) shows the correlation coeﬃcient between the Fourier transforms at adjacent wave numbers,
n′ i)1/2 with n′ = n + 1. At around the energy peaks, we observe signiﬁcant correlations. The
Cnn′ = hanan′ i/(ha2
Fourier transforms are not mutually independent.

The quasi-periodic motions should have ﬁnite correlation lengths. Namely, the motions should not be exactly
periodic. If this were not the case, the central limit theorem would not be applicable to the calculation of the Fourier
transforms (Sec. II). Then the transforms would not have a Gaussian PDF. This is inconsistent with our result
(Fig. 2).

For velocity diﬀerences δu = u(x + δx) − u(x) and δv = v(x + δx) − v(x), where δx is the separation in the mean-
wind direction, Fig. 6 shows the variances hδu2i and hδv2i, the ﬂatness factors Fδu and Fδv, the skewness factors Sδu
and Sδv, and the streamwise-transverse correlation Cδuδv. At small separations, we observe enhancements of Fδu,
Fδv, Sδu and Cδuδv. They are due to small-scale coherent structures [3, 9, 12, 13] and are not of our interest. At
large separations, we observe oscillations of hδu2i, hδv2i, Fδu, Fδv, Sδu, Sδv, and Cδuδv. Their wavelengths roughly
correspond to the wave number k ≃ 7 m−1 of the spectral energy peak. The oscillations of hδu2i and hδv2i are in
phase, while those of Sδu and Sδu are ±90◦ out of phase and those of Fδu, Fδv, and Cδuδv are 180◦ out of phase.

Our results are explained if the velocity ﬁeld is a superposition of a few quasi-periodic motions and a random
background. It is actually possible to reproduce the oscillations and their phases qualitatively with a few sinusoidal
functions satisfying the solenoidal condition and a random Gaussian noise.

The quasi-periodic motions are predominant at local maxima of the variances hδu2i and hδv2i. Since the ﬂatness
factor Fδv is locally minimal and less than 3 there, the transverse-velocity amplitudes of those quasi-periodic motions
lie in a limited range (see also Ref.
[5]). This discussion would apply to the streamwise velocity as well. The
oscillations of Sδu and Sδv imply the presence of quasi-periodic motions with diﬀerent wave numbers that are coupled
with each other (see also Fig. 5(b)).

The background ﬂow is predominant at local minima of the variances. Since the ﬂatness factor Fδu is greater
than 3 there, the streamwise background tends to be intermittent. This tendency is not signiﬁcant in the transverse
background, which exhibits Fδv ≃ 3 even at its local maxima. The slight enhancement of Cδuδv implies that the
streamwise and transverse components of the background ﬂow tends to have a correlation.

Overall, the observed sub-Gaussianity of the transverse ﬂuctuations is due to quasi-periodic motions that have
ﬁnite amplitudes. The hyper-Gaussianity of the streamwise ﬂuctuations is due to a background ﬂow that tends to be
intermittent.

C. Gaussian PDF in fully developed turbulence

The transverse velocity has a Gaussian PDF at intermediate distances from the grid, i.e., d >

∼ 1 m in the small
tunnel and d <
∼ 10 m in the large tunnel (Figs. 3 and 4). This is because turbulence is fully developed there. Wavy
wakes of the grid rods have evolved to energy-containing eddies that are random and independent. The corresponding
Fourier transforms are thus independent. Actually we did not ﬁnd spectral energy peaks such as those observed at
d = 0.25 m. The wave-number–wave-number correlation in the energy-containing range k <
∼ 10 m−1 is absent within
the statistical uncertainty, |Cnn′ | <

The grid turbulence at the intermediate distances does not exhibit large-separation oscillations of hδu2i, hδv2i, Fδu,
Fδv, Sδu, Sδv, and Cδuδv. The ﬂatness factors Fδu and Fδv as well as the skewness factors Sδu and Sδv at large
separations are identical to the Gaussian values. The streamwise-transverse correlation Cδuδv at large separations is
absent. These are observed usually in fully developed turbulence [1, 2, 10, 13].

∼ 0.1.

D. Hyper-Gaussian PDF in decayed turbulence

The streamwise and transverse velocities have hyper-Gaussian PDFs at largest distances from the grid, d >

∼ 10 m.
The streamwise-transverse correlation Cuv is also enhanced there (Figs. 3 and 4). For the separations δx = 0.20 m ≃ lu
and δx = 0.40 m ≃ 2lu, Fig. 7 shows the ﬂatness factors Fδu and Fδv and the streamwise-transverse correlation Cδuδv.
They increase with the distance. Since the grid turbulence has decayed (Fig. 1), there remain only strong energy-
containing eddies [1], which intermittently pass the probe. The enhancement of the ﬂatness factors Fδu and Fδv is
due to enhanced values of δu and δv, which should be associated with the surviving strong eddies. The streamwise-
transverse correlation Cδuδv is enhanced if δu and δv are enhanced simultaneously at the positions of those eddies. In
this case, velocity ﬂuctuations u(x) and v(x) are also enhanced at the eddy positions, resulting in the hyper-Gaussian
PDFs as well as the signiﬁcant streamwise-transverse correlation Cuv.

The presence of large-scale spatial structures implies a correlation among the corresponding Fourier transforms.
Since the spatial structures consist of many Fourier modes, the correlation is not local in the wave number space.
Although we failed to detect any signiﬁcant correlation, we found moderate correlations with |Cnn′ | ≃ 0.2 between
many wave numbers in the energy-containing range k <
∼ 10 m−1.
Roughly at the position where the ﬂatness factors Fu and Fv begin to diﬀer from the Gaussian value, the skewness
factor for the streamwise velocity Su changes its sign (Fig. 4). This is probably because turbulence becomes weak.
The positive skewness is more signiﬁcant at a smaller distance from the grid and is attributable to the turbulence
itself. On the other hand, the negative skewness is more signiﬁcant at a larger distance. Using a low-pass ﬁltering
technique, we ascertained the presence of long-wavelength motions along the mean-ﬂow direction (k ≪ 1 m−1). Their
amplitude is larger and their PDF is more negatively skewed at a larger distance from the grid. These long-wavelength
motions are attributable to eﬀects of the wind tunnel, e.g., wall eﬀects and deceleration of the mean ﬂow.

E. Small scale statistics

Small-scale coherent structures such as vortex tubes in fully developed turbulence have attracted much interest
[3, 9, 12, 13]. The statistics that are studied most often are the ﬂatness factors F∂u/∂x and F∂v/∂x and the skewness
factor S∂u/∂x of the velocity derivatives ∂u/∂x and ∂v/∂x. An increase of the microscale Reynolds number Reλ =
hu2i1/2λ/ν is known to cause the increase of F∂u/∂x and F∂v/∂x and the decrease of S∂u/∂x [9]. Here ν is the kinematic
viscosity. We brieﬂy summarize overall trends of Reλ, F∂u/∂x, F∂v/∂x, and S∂u/∂x over distances from the grid. They
are not of our interest but are expected to be helpful in a future experimental research.

The microscale Reynolds number Reλ decreases with the distance as shown in Fig. 8(a). The ﬂatness factors F∂u/∂x
and F∂v/∂x increase as shown in Fig. 8(b). The skewness factor S∂u/∂x decreases as shown in Fig. 8(c). Thus the
dependences of F∂u/∂x, F∂v/∂x, and S∂u/∂x on Reλ are apparently opposite to those mentioned above. This is because
the turbulence state changes from developing to fully developed, and to decayed with an increase of the distance. In
order to compare with other experimental data, the measurement is required to be done at a position where the grid
turbulence is in the fully developed state.

V. CONCLUSION

The PDF of velocity ﬂuctuations was studied systematically for grid turbulence. At small distances from the grid,
where the turbulence is still developing, there are quasi-periodic motions having ﬁnite amplitudes, and hence the
PDF is sub-Gaussian. At intermediate distances from the grid, where the turbulence is fully developed, motions
of energy-containing eddies are random, and hence the PDF is Gaussian. At large distances from the grid, where
the turbulence has decayed, there remain only strong eddies, and hence the PDF is hyper-Gaussian. The Fourier
transforms of the velocity ﬂuctuations always have Gaussian PDFs, in accordance with the central limit theorem.
At intermediate distances from the grid, the Fourier transforms are statistically independent of each other. This is
the necessary and suﬃcient condition for Gaussianity of the velocity ﬂuctuations. At small and large distances, the
Fourier transforms are dependent.

Our result serves as an example that the velocity ﬂuctuations could have a sub-Gaussian PDF if there exist strong
ﬁnite-amplitude motions. We suspect that this is the case in experiments of Noullez et al. [3] and Sreenivasan and
Dhruva [4]. They obtained Fv ≃ 2.85 in a free air jet and Fu = 2.66 in an atmospheric boundary layer, respectively
(see also Refs. [11, 12]), for which no explanation has been proposed yet. The signal could suﬀer from ﬁnite-amplitude
motions generated by the jet nozzle or the surface. It is of interest to analyze such data in the same manner as in our
present work.

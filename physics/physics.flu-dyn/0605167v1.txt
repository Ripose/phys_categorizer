The essence of shear instability is fully revealed both mathematically and physically. A general
suﬃcient and necessary stable criterion is obtained analytically within linear context.
It is the
analogue of Kelvin-Arnol’d theorem, i.e., the stable ﬂow minimizes the kinetic energy associated
with vorticity. Then the mechanism of shear instability is explored by combining the mechanisms
of both Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (K-H instability) and resonance of waves.
It requires both
concentrated vortex and resonant waves for the instability. The waves, which have same phase
speed with the concentrated vortex, have interactions with the vortex to trigger the instability.
We call this mechanism as ”concentrated vortex instability”. The physical explanation of shear
instability is also sketched. Finally, some useful criteria are derived from the theorem. These results
would intrigue future works to investigate the other hydrodynamic instabilities.

The hydrodynamic instability is a fundamental prob-
lem in many ﬁelds, such as ﬂuid dynamics, astrodynam-
ics, oceanography, meteorology, etc. There are many
kinds of hydrodynamic instabilities, e.g., shear instability
due to velocity shear, thermal instability due to heating,
viscous instability due to viscosity and centrifugal insta-
bility due to rotation, etc. Among them, the shear insta-
bility is the most important and the simplest one, which
has been intensively explored (see [1, 2, 3] and references
therein). Both linear and nonlinear stabilities of shear
ﬂow have been considered, and some important conclu-
sions have also be obtained from the investigations.

On the one hand, the nonlinear stability of shear ﬂow
has been investigated via variational principles. Kelvin
[4] and Arnol’d [5, 6, 7] have developed variational prin-
ciples for two-dimensional inviscid ﬂow [8]. They showed
that the steady ﬂows are the stationary solutions of the
energy H. And if the second variation δ2H is deﬁnite,
then the steady ﬂow is nonlinearly stable. Moreover,
Arnol’d proved that the ﬂow is linearly stable provided
that δ2H is positive deﬁnite, and he also proved two non-
linear stability criteria [6, 7, 8, 9]. However, δ2H is al-
ways indeﬁnite in sign, except for two special cases (see
[9] and references therein). Though variational principle
is indeed powerful, it is also inconvenient for real appli-
cations due to the lack of the explicit expressions in both
H and the stability criteria.

On the other hand, the linear stability of shear ﬂow has
also been investigated via Rayleigh’s equation. Within
the linear context, there are three important general
stability criteria, which are Rayleigh’s criterion [10],
Fjørtoft’s criterion [11] and Sun’s criterion [12]. As all
the criteria have explicit expressions, they are more con-
venient in real applications, and are widely used in many
ﬁelds. Based on the former investigations, Sun [12] also

∗Electronic address: sunl@ustc.edu.cn;sunl@ustc.edu

pointed out that the ﬂow is stable for Rayleigh’s quotient
I(f ) > 0 (see Eq.(3) behind). However, the suﬃcient cri-
terion for instability still lacks.

To understand the shear instability, some mechanisms
were suggested. Among them, Kelvin-Helmholtz insta-
bility (K-H instability) is always taken as a prototype,
which is physically explained as the instability of a sheet
vortex [13]. An another mechanism of instability is due to
the resonance of waves [3, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Butler and Far-
rell [15] clearly showed with numerical simulations that
the resonance introduces an algebraic growth term into
the temporal development of a disturbance. Baines and
Mitsudera [16] also used broken-line proﬁle velocity as
a prototype to explain the interaction of waves. Their
explanation is so brilliant that it can explain why the
instability occurs for a ﬁnite range of wavenumber and
how the waves amplify each other. However, both mecha-
nisms are independent of the basic ﬂows, for that Kelvin-
Helmholtz model deals only with vortex and resonance
mechanism only considers the waves. Thus the relation-
ships between those mechanisms and the shear ﬂows are
still covered.

Overview the former investigations, the essence of the
shear instability is remained to be elucidated. Though
H is very important in variational principles, both the
explicit expression and the meaning of it have not been
revealed before. The connection between linear and non-
linear stability criteria should be retrieved explicitly. The
relationships between instability mechanisms and the
physical explanation for shear instability are needed. The
aim of this letter is to fully reveal the essence of the shear
instability by investigating the inviscid shear ﬂows in a
channel. And other instabilities in hydrodynamics may
also be understood via the investigation here.

For the two-dimensional inviscid ﬂows with the velocity
of U , the vorticity ξ = ∇×U is conserved along pathlines
[2, 8, 13]:

dξ

∂ξ

=

+ (U · ∇)ξ = 0.

(1)

Its linear disturbance reduces to Rayleigh’s equation pro-
vided the basic ﬂow U being parallel. Consider an shear
ﬂow with parallel horizontal velocity U (y) in a channel, as
shown in Fig.1. The amplitude of disturbed ﬂow stream-
function ψ, namely φ, satisﬁes [1, 2, 3] :

φ = 0,

where k is the nonnegative real wavenumber and c =
cr + ici is the complex phase speed and double prime
′′ denotes the second derivative with respect to y. The
real part cr is the phase speed of wave, and ci 6= 0 de-
notes instability. This equation is to be solved subject to
homogeneous boundary conditions φ = 0 at y = a, b.

Consider that the velocity proﬁle U (y) has an inﬂection
point ys at which U ′′
s = U ′′(ys) = 0 and Us = U (ys).
As Sun [12] has pointed out, the following Rayleigh’s
quotient I(f ) > 0 implies the ﬂow is stable.

I(f ) = min

(3)

where f (y) = U ′′
U−Us . While if I(f ) < 0, then there is
a neutral stable model with k2
N = −I(f ) and cr = Us.
Moreover, there are unstable modes with cr = Us and
ci 6= 0 if I(f ) < 0 and 0 ≤ k < kN . This can also be
proved by following the way by Tollmien [18], Friedrichs
[1, 19, 20] and Lin [21]. Thus I(f ) = 0 means the ﬂow
is neutrally stable. And there is only one neutral mode
with k = 0 and cr = Us in the ﬂow. These conclusions
can be summarized as a new theorem.

Tollmien-Fridrichs-Lin theorem: The ﬂows are neu-
trally stable, if I(f ) = 0. The ﬂows are stable and un-
stable for I(f ) > 0 and I(f ) < 0, respectively.

From the above proof, it is obvious that the shortwaves
(e.g. k ≫ kN ) are always more stable than longwaves
(e.g. k ≪ kN ) in the inviscid shear ﬂows [20, 22]. So the
shear instability is due to long-wave instability, and the
disturbances of shortwaves can be damped by the shear
itself without any viscosity [22].

As mentioned above, the linear stability criterion can
be derived from the nonlinear one [6]. Moreover, the
nonlinear stability criterion can also be obtained from
the linear one. To illuminate this, the nonlinear criterion
is retrieved explicitly via the above theorem, which is
brieﬂy proved as follows.

Similar to Arnol’d’s deﬁnition, the general energy H

here is deﬁned as

H =

where Ψ(y) is the streamfunction of the ﬂow with ∂Ψ
∂y =
U (y) − Us, and h(Ψ) is a function of Ψ. The variation of
δH = 0 gives

△Ψ = h

(Ψ).

So Arnol’d’s variational principle is retrieved. The func-
tion h = k∇Ψk2/2 can also be solved from Eq.(5). The
second variation δ2H holds

δ2H =

[k∇ψk2 + h

(Ψ)ψ2]dy,

where ψ denotes the variation δΨ. Noting that h′′(Ψ)
remains unknown, Arnol’d’s nonlinear criteria have not
be extensively used. Fortunately, we can obtain the ex-
plicit expression of h′′(Ψ) here via the investigation on
the linear stability criterion. For ∂Ψ

∂y = U − Us,

(Ψ) =

(7)

As h′′(Ψ) is solved explicitly, δ2H has an explicit expres-
sion, which is greatly helpful for real applications.

Let the streamfunction of the perturbation ψ(x, y, t) =
φ(y)ei(kx−ωt), where ω is the frequency. The averages of
k∇ψk2 and kψk2 are (kφ′k2+k2kφk2)/2 and kφk2/2 along
the ﬂow direction x, respectively. So Eq.(6) reduces to

δ2H =

k2 + k2kφk2 + f (y)kφk2]dy.

The sign of δ2H is then associated with I(f ) in Eq.(3). If
I(f ) < 0, the second variation δ2H can be both negative
and positive, i.e., the stationary solution is a saddle point.
And I(f ) > 0 implies δ2H is positive deﬁnite and vice
versa. So the stable ﬂow has the minimum value of the
total kinetic energy H. The physical meaning of H can
also be revealed, as the explicit expressions of H, ∂Ψ
∂y =
U − Us and h′′(Ψ) = f (y) are obtained.

First, according to the expressions, the velocity U in
vorticity conservation law Eq.(1) can be decomposed to
two parts: the rotational ﬂow U − Us and the irrotational
advection ﬂow Us. The vorticity ξ in Eq.(1) depends
only on U − Us, and Us is only advection velocity. Then
U − Us and Us are associated with the dynamics and
kinetics of the ﬂow, respectively. Eq.(1) physically shows
that the vorticity ﬁeld is advected by Us, which can also
known from the conservation of vorticity in the inviscid
ﬂows. A similar example is the dynamics of vortex in the
wake behind cylinder, where the vortices dominate the
dynamics of the ﬂow and they are advected by mean ﬂow
(see Fig.2 in [23]). The decomposition of velocity may
be useful in vortex dynamics, for that our investigation
clearly shows that the dynamics of the ﬂow is dominated
by vorticity distribution.

Then the physical meaning of H can also be under-

U − Us that is associated with the general energy H, so

H = 1
a (U − Us)2dy is not the total kinetic energy but

the kinetic energy of ﬂow with vorticity. Thus the stable
R
steady states are always minimizing the kinetic energy of
the ﬂow associated with vorticity. This is also the reason
why the ﬂow with maximum vorticity might be unstable,
as Fjørtoft’s criterion shows. We would like to restate it

as a theorem and to name it after Kelvin [4] and Arnol’d
[6] for their contributions on this ﬁeld [8].

Kelvin-Arnol’d theorem: the stable ﬂow minimizes the

kinetic energy of ﬂow associated with vorticity.

Both Tollmien-Fridrichs-Lin theorem and Kelvin-
Arnol’d theorem are equivalent to the following simple
principle [24]: The ﬂow is stable, if and only if all the
disturbances with cr = Us are neutrally stable.

We have obtained the suﬃcient and necessary condi-
tions for instability, then the physical mechanism of in-
stability can be understood from them. The following
investigation will reveal that the essence of shear insta-
bility is due to the interaction between the ”concentrated
vortex” and the corresponding resonant waves.

The concept of ”concentrated vortex” comes from
Fjørtoft’s and Sun’s criteria, where the necessary condi-
tions for instability require that the base vorticity must
be concentrated enough [12]. We call it ”concentrated
vortex” for latter convenience. The concentrated vor-
tex is a general model of sheet vortex in the Kelvin-
Helmholtz model, for that the sheet vortex can be recov-
ered as the concentrated vortex ξ(ys) → ∞ (see [25] for
a comprehensive discussion about the Kelvin-Helmholtz
model and continued shear proﬁles). Then how the shear
ﬂow becomes unstable, if there is a concentrated vortex?
As the suﬃcient condition for instability is I(f ) < 0,
the normal modes in the regime of 0 ≤ k < kN with
cr = Us are unstable. They are stationary or standing
waves, comparing to the velocity at inﬂection point. So
that the shear instability is due to the disturbance of con-
centrated vortex by the standing waves with cr = Us. In
this case, the resonance mechanism is valid. The inter-
action waves propagate at the same speed with the con-
centrated vortex, so that they are locked together and
ampliﬁed by simple advection [16]. In short, the distur-
bances on concentrated vortex is ampliﬁed like that in
Kelvin-Helmholtz model.

This instability mechanism combines both K-H insta-
bility and resonance mechanism. Physically, the standing
waves (with cr = Us) can interact with the concentrated
vortex, so they can trigger instability in the ﬂows. While
the travelling waves (with cr 6= Us) have no interaction
with the concentrated vortex, so that they can not trigger
instability in the ﬂows. This is the mechanism of shear
instability. As pointed out above, the shear instability is
due to long-wave instability. If the longwaves are unsta-
ble, they can obtain the energy from background ﬂows.
In this way, the energy within small scales transfer to
and concentrate on large scales. In this way, the shear
instability itself provides a mechanism to inverse energy
cascade and to maintain the large structures or coherent
structures in the complex ﬂows.

To illuminate the mechanism of shear instability, a
physical diagram is also presented here by following
the way of interpreting the K-H instability [13]. Fig.1
sketches the mechanism of shear instability in terms of
wave disturbances of vortices. The mean velocity pro-
ﬁle U (y) has an inﬂection point at ys = 0 with Us = 0,

FIG. 1: Sketch of shear instability: physical interpretation.
Left parts depict the proﬁles of velocity U (y) and vorticity
ξ(y), right ones depict the disturbance of vorticities. The un-
stable veloctiy proﬁle U (y) has a local maximum in vorticity
ξ(y) (a). If the vortices (A, B and C) disturbed from their
original positions (dashed line) to new places (solid curve),
they will be taken away from their original positions due to
pressure diﬀerence. The stable veloctiy proﬁle U (y) has a lo-
cal minimum in vorticity ξ(y) (b). The disturbed vortices (A’,
B’ and C’) will be brought back to their original positions due
to pressure diﬀerence.

and the corresponding vorticity is ξ(y) = −U ′(y). There
is a local maximum at ys in the unstable vorticity pro-
ﬁle in Fig.1a. According to Eq.(1), the vorticity is con-
served in the inviscid ﬂows. If the vortices at the local
maximum (A, B and C) are sinusoidally disturbed from
their original positions (dashed line) to new places (solid
curve), they have negative vorticities with respect to the
undisturbed ones. The vortices will induce cyclone ﬂows
around them in consequence. The ﬂows around the vor-
tices become faster (slower) in the upper (lower) of vortex
A referred to the basic ﬂow U (y). The pressures at up-
per and lower decrease (indicated by - signs) and increase
(indicated by + signs) according to Bernoulli’s theorem,
respectively. Then vortex A gets a upward acceleration
due to the disturbed pressure diﬀerence as the uparrow
shows. This tends to take the vortex away from its orig-
inal position, so the ﬂow is unstable. On the other hand,
Fig.1b depicts the disturbances in a stable velocity pro-
ﬁle, where a local minimum is in the vorticity proﬁle.

4

The disturbed vortices have positive vorticities with re-
spect to the undisturbed ones. The vortices will induce
anticyclone ﬂows around them in consequence. So vor-
tex A’ get a downward acceleration due to the disturbed
pressure diﬀerence as the downarrow shows. This tends
to bring the vortex back from its original position, so
the ﬂow is stable. In this interpretation, the advection
of Us is independent of the shear instability, only the
ﬂow ﬁeld of U − Us and the corresponding vorticity ξ
are the dominations. The unstable disturbances in Fig
1 have cr = Us, which consists with the former discus-
sions. This physically explains why the maximum and
minimum vorticities have diﬀerent stable aspects.

Though Tollmien-Fridrichs-Lin theorem is a suﬃcient
and necessary condition for stability, the unknown φ in
the theorem restricts its application. So some simple cri-
teria may be more useful. For the parallel ﬂows within
interval a < y < b, there are two simple criteria.

Corollary 1: The ﬂow is stable for f (y) > −( π

b−a )2

[12, 24].

Corollary 2: The ﬂow is unstable for f (y) < −( π

b−a )2

[24].

In summary, the general stability and instability crite-
ria are obtained for inviscid parallel ﬂow. And the crite-
rion is associated with a minimum value of energy, which
shows the relationship between linear and nonlinear sta-
bility criteria. Then the mechanism of shear instability
is investigated, which is explained as the resonance of
standing waves with the concentrated vortex at cr = Us.
A physical explanation is also sketched. Finally, some

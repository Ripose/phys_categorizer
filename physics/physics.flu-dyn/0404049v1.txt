1 Introduction

In many Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulence researchers inject
power into the ﬂuid at large scales and then observe how it “propagates”
to the small scales [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. One such type of
stirring is to take the force f (x, t) to be proportional to the projection of the
velocity u(x, t) of the ﬂow onto its lowest Fourier modes, while keeping the
rate of injected external power constant. In this paper we perform a simple but
rigorous analysis to establish bounds on the relationship between the energy
dissipation rate (which is the same as the injected power) and the resulting
Reynolds number. While this analysis cannot give detailed information of the
energy spectrum, it does provide some indication of the balance of energy
between the lower, directly forced, modes, and those excited by the cascade.
This work is an extension of the analysis in [13, 14, 15], where the force is
ﬁxed (not a functional of the velocity).

Consider ﬂuid in a periodic d-dimensional box of side length ℓ. The allowed
Zd is a d-dimensional
ℓ a, where a

2 Derivation of the bounds

2.1 Lower bounds on the energy dissipation

To obtain lower bounds on the energy dissipation, we proceed as usual by
multiplying the Navier-Stokes equation (2) by u(x, t) and integrating over
the volume of the ﬂuid to obtain the instantaneous power balance,

This estimate, however, is obviously not going to be tight for small Re, when
the ﬂow is not very turbulent. To improve this estimate so that it take into
account the fact that for small Re the energy does not “propagate” much
from the large to the small wavenumbers, we split the velocity u into a “low-

2.4 Optimizing the upper bound on β

Since we do not have a priori control over p, we will derive an upper bound
for β by maximizing the upper bound in (19) over p, after which we use the
freedom in the choice of the parameter z > 0 to minimize for any given Re,
which results in

Although this procedure is not diﬃcult to implement numerically, we will
analyze only the case of high Re where the analysis can be carried out an-
alytically. First notice that for high Re, the lower bound pmin(Re, z) is very
small, so the maximization over p can be taken in the entire interval [0, 1].
Thus φ(p, z)
).
Since for large Re the Re-independent term in the right-hand side of (21) is
dominating, we have the high-Re estimate

A plot of the bounds is presented in Figure 1. At low Re, the upper and lower
bounds converge to each other. While it is diﬃcult to compare these bounds
quantitatively with DNS results, we note from [7] that at high Re, values
of β are typically around 1. Hence, our rigorous analysis, while yielding the
expected scaling, overestimates the constants by about an order of magnitude.
In the 3-dimensional case, if we assume that the cascade is Kolmogorov,

Abstract

Nontrivial steady ﬂow ﬁelds have recently been found that capture the main structures of the

turbulent buﬀer layer. We study the eﬀect of polymer on these “exact coherent states” (ECS) in

plane Couette ﬂow. When the Weissenberg number based on the largest Liapunov exponent for

the velocity ﬁeld is & 1/2 and the polymer extensibility is suﬃcently high, the Reynolds number at

which the ECS appear increases from the Newtonian value. Correspondingly, wall-normal motion

in the streamwise streaks is suppressed, reducing the redistribution of mean shear and leading to

drag reduction.

Rheological drag reduction, the suppression by additives of skin friction in turbulent ﬂow,

has received much attention since its discovery in 1947 [1, 2, 3]. For many polymer-solvent
systems, the pressure drop measured in the pipe ﬂow of the solution can be 30 − 50% less

than for the solvent alone. The central rheological feature of drag-reducing additives is

their extensional behavior in solution: for dilute polymer solutions in particular the stresses

arising in extensional ﬂow can be orders of magnitude larger than those developed in a

shear ﬂow. This fact is well-recognized; nevertheless the mechanism of interaction between

polymer stretching and turbulent structure is not well-understood and the goal of the present

work is to attempt to shed light on this interaction.

The key structural observation from experiments and DNS of drag-reducing solutions is

the modiﬁcation of the buﬀer region near the wall [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. It has long been

known that the ﬂow in this region is very structured, containing streamwise vortices that

lead to streaks in the streamwise velocity [11]; these structures are thickened in both the

wall-normal and spanwise directions during ﬂow of drag reducing solutions [4, 5]. Because

of its importance in the production and dissipation of turbulent energy [11], any eﬀort to

mechanistically understand rheological drag reduction should focus on this region.

To better understand the eﬀect of the polymer on the buﬀer layer, we wish to study

a model ﬂow that has structures similar to those seen in this region but without the full

complexities of time-dependent turbulent ﬂows. Fortunately, a family of such model ﬂows

exists, in the recently-discovered “exact coherent states” (ECS) found by computational

bifurcation analysis in plane Couette and plane Poiseuille ﬂows [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. These are

three-dimensional, steady (in a traveling reference frame) ﬂows that appear via saddle-node

bifurcations at a Reynolds number near the transition value seen in experiments [17, 18].

The structure of the ECS captures the counter-rotating staggered streamwise vortices that

dominate the structure in the buﬀer region. From the dynamical point of view, there is

evidence that these states form a part of the dynamical skeleton of the turbulent ﬂow: i.e.,

they are saddle points that underlie the strange attractor of turbulence [19]. Finally, the

nonlinear self-sustaining mechanism underlying these states has been elucidated [20]. A

perturbation of the base ﬂow in the form of streamwise vortices redistributes the streamwise

momentum of the ﬂow. This redistribution creates spanwise ﬂuctuations in the streamwise

velocity, the “streaks”. The spanwise inﬂections in the streamwise velocity proﬁle lead to

a three-dimensional instability that develops into staggered nearly-streamwise vortices that

2

regenerate the streaks. Because the ECS capture the structures of the buﬀer region and

are mechanistically well-understood, we believe that they provide an excellent simpliﬁed,

yet still exact model ﬂow for studying polymer drag reduction. The leading order eﬀect of

viscoelasticity on the ECS is therefore the focus of the present study.

To clarify how polymers behave in general ﬂows, we brieﬂy describe here a general result

relating polymer stretch to ﬂow kinematics. For a trajectory in a ﬂow ﬁeld, the Liapunov

exponents give the Lagrangian time-averaged rate of stretch of material lines. If the largest

Liapunov exponent, σmax, is positive, the ﬂow is extensional on average. In particular, for

homogeneous turbulence, the expected value of σmax is positive [21] and we show below that

this is also the case for the ECS. Now consider the dynamics of a Hookean dumbbell model

of a polymer in a ﬂow ﬁeld. The end-to-end vector q of the dumbbell evolves in the ﬂow

ﬁeld, v, as:

Dq
Dt

= κ·q − 1
2λ

q + ξ(t),

(1)

where κ = (∇v)T , λ is the stress relaxation time for the dumbbell and ξ(t) is the random

Brownian force. Noting that an inﬁnitesimal material line satisﬁes the same expression but
with λ−1 and ξ set to zero, it is straightforward to show that Hookean dumbbells will stretch
indeﬁnitely in a ﬂow if and only if λσmax ≡ Weσ > 1

2 , where Weσ is a Weissenberg number
based on σmax. This result is a speciﬁc statement of an idea that originated with Lumley [22]

(see also [23, 24, 25]). The computations below show the importance of Weσ in determining

the eﬀect of polymers on coherent structures.

We study here the eﬀect of polymer on the exact coherent states that arise in a variant of

plane Couette ﬂow [16]. Denoting the streamwise direction as x, the wall-normal direction as

∂vx

y, and the spanwise, or vorticity, direction as z, we consider a ﬂow with boundary conditions
∂y = 0 at y = ±1. The characteristic velocity, U, and the half-height of the
∂y = 1, vy = ∂vz
channel, l, have been used to scale the velocity and positions, respectively. These “constant

vorticity” boundary conditions provide an advantage over no-slip conditions in that they

allow us to model only the buﬀer region in our domain by eliminating the viscous sublayer.

(The exact coherent states found using no-slip BCs [13] show a qualitatively identical vortical

structure, only oﬀset from the wall by a small region that is the viscous sublayer.) Periodic

boundary conditions are applied in the streamwise and spanwise directions. For this study,

the wavelength of the structures in the streamwise and spanwise directions are ﬁxed at

3

ℓx = 2π/0.40 and ℓz = 2π/1.0, respectively. For this ﬂow, a trivial (Couette) base state

exists, vx(y) = y; the maximum mean velocity for the ECS is signiﬁcantly reduced compared

to the base state velocity due to the enhanced transport of momentum [16].

In our formulation, time, t, is scaled with l/U, and pressure, p, with ρU 2, where ρ is the

ﬂuid density. The stress due to the polymer, τ p, is nondimensionalized with the polymer

elastic modulus, G = ηp/λ, where ηp is the polymer contribution to the zero-shear viscosity

and λ is the relaxation time for the polymer — the polymer model is described below. The

momentum balance and the equation of continuity are

where ηs is the solvent viscosity, El = λ(ηs + ηp)/ρl2 and β = ηs/(ηs + ηp). The Reynolds

number, Re, is based on the total viscosity, Re = ρUl/(ηs + ηp).

We calculate the polymer stress with the commonly used FENE-P model [26], which

idealizes the polymer molecules as bead-spring dumbbells with ﬁnitely extensible springs.

With this model, the non-dimensional structure tensor α evolves according to:

is the Weissenberg number based on the wall shear rate and b is proportional

A simple measure of the importance of extensional polymer stress is the magnitude of

the parameter Ex = 2
. In uniaxial extension with extension rate ˙ε, Ex = 1 implies that
3
τ p = τ v as ˙ε → ∞ where τ v is the solvent contribution to the stress. The polymer can

signiﬁcantly aﬀect the ﬂow only when Ex & 1.

The governing equations are solved through a Picard iteration. A given velocity ﬁeld is

ﬁrst used to calculate the polymer stress tensor, τ p, by time-integrating Eq. 4 until a steady

state is attained. For the new τ p, a steady state of the momentum and continuity equations

is found by Newton iteration. The resulting velocity ﬁeld, is used to compute the new τ p,

and the process is repeated until the velocity ﬁeld converges. The procedure converges at

El = 0.2 for values of Ex up to about 2, suﬃcient to show the ﬁrst eﬀects of polymers

on turbulent structure. The momentum and continuity equations are discretized as in [16],
using a Fourier-Galerkin formulation with typically a 7×19×7 grid. The structure tensor,

α, is discretized with a Fourier-pseudospectral method and time-integration performed with

an Adams-Bashforth method. To achieve numerical stability, a small diﬀusive term is added

to Eq. 4 (cf. [9]) and integrated with a Crank-Nicholson scheme. This equation was solved
on a ﬁner mesh than the momentum, continuity pair, typically 32×32×32.

Before presenting the eﬀects of the polymer on the ECS, we recall the result that W eσ >

1/2 implies large stretch of polymer chains. We have computed σmax with the algorithm

of [27] for the Newtonian ECS velocity ﬁeld at Re = 110 on the upper branch of the
bifurcation diagram (see Fig. 1). This vector ﬁeld is very nearly ergodic, with σmax ≈ 0.030.

The condition Weσ > 1/2 thus translates into We & 17 for large polymer stretch, and for

Ex = O(1), will deﬁne the onset condition for the polymer to begin to strongly aﬀect the

ﬂow ﬁeld. In DNS of a FENE-P ﬂuid in plane channel ﬂow, Sureshkumar, et al. [9], found

no drag reduction at We = 12.5 and signiﬁcant drag reduction at We = 25. This close

correspondence between the onset condition predicted from the ECS kinematics and that

found by DNS suggests that the ECS model captures the essential structure of the buﬀer

layer.

FIG. 1: Newtonian and viscoelastic (El = 0.20, β = 0.97) bifurcation diagrams. ——— Newtonian;

— — — Ex = 1; — · — Ex = 2.

Fig. 1 shows how the addition of polymer stress aﬀects the bifurcation diagram for El =

5

0.20 (where W eσ ≈ 2/3) and Ex = 1 and 2. On the y-axis of the diagram is the variable Ax,

which is the amplitude of the velocity mode corresponding to the wavevector k = (1, 0, 0).

Hence, Ax is a measure of the streamwise “waviness” in the streamwise streak and provides a

simple measure of the three-dimensionality of the ﬂow. The Couette ﬂow solution is the line

Ax = 0. When Re attains a certain value that we denote Resn, two new solutions appear

in a saddle-node bifurcation. For suﬃciently high values of the extensibility parameter
(Ex ≈ 1.5) Resn increases above the Newtonian value – the presence of the polymer is

suppressing the ECS. For lower values of Ex, where the polymer stress is smaller in relation

to the viscous stress, Resn decreases compared to the Newtonian value. A minimum in Resn

is also seen when varying the elasticity at constant extensibility.

To examine more closely the eﬀect of the polymer stress on the three-dimensionality

of the solutions, Fig. 2 shows results at constant Re while varying El, or, equivalently,

Weσ (based on the Newtonian value σmax = 0.030 found at Re = 110). After an initial

increase in the three-dimensionality for El = 1, Ax decreases below the Newtonian value

and eventually saturates, as the polymer stress asymptotes at high Weσ to a ﬁxed value

relative to the viscous stress. In this case, the polymer stretch becomes nearly uniformly

large throughout the domain. The decrease in Ax with Weσ is even more drastic as the

extensibility parameter increases from Ex = 1 to Ex = 2.

Identical trends are seen for

the spatially averaged streamwise enstrophy, consistent with DNS results [10]. Since Ex

is related to the extensional viscosity of the viscoelastic solution, these results show the

importance of extensional stresses in aﬀecting the ECS. The maximum over the domain

of trα, which is proportional to the square of the polymer extension is also presented in

Fig. 2. Most of the polymer stretch occurs for Weσ . 1.0. This ﬁgure also reemphasizes

the importance of Weσ in determining the eﬀect of polymer on ﬂow. The majority of both

the polymer stretch and the suppression of the three-dimensionality occurs in the range

0.1 < Weσ < 1.0.

Figs. 3a-b show (a) the streamwise velocity vx at y = 1 for the Newtonian upper branch
solution at Re = 110 and (b) the diﬀerence vx,V E − vx,N between the viscoelastic (VE) and

Newtonian (N) solutions. In this ﬁgure we see the “streak” (white ribbon) and that this

streak is “straightened out” by the viscoelasticity. Plots of surfaces of constant streamwise

velocity and constant polymer extension (Fig. 4) show that the highest polymer stretch

(which is predominantly in the streamwise direction) corresponds to the streaks in the

streamwise velocity. Very little stretch is seen in the cores of the vortices, an observa-

tion which does not support proposed mechanisms of drag reduction based on suppression

of vortex stretching, e.g. [28]. Based on the above observations, we believe that the elon-

gation of the polymer in the streamwise streak alters the ECS by a streamline tension

mechanism [29, 30, 31]. The extra tension in the streaks causes them to resist spanwise

deformation, weakening the eﬀect of the inﬂectional instability that feeds the vortices and

thereby suppressing the redistribution of momentum. This eﬀect is also seen in the wall-

normal velocity, whose maximum value (under the same conditions as in Figs. 3 and 4) is

reduced from the Newtonian value by 5.9%.

Finally, do we see drag reduction? This question can be addressed in two ways. First,
consider Fig. 1. For the Newtonian ﬂow, Resn ≈ 105. For El = 0.2 and Ex = 2, Resn ≈ 106.

The existence of the ECS, which, of course, have higher drag or, in the present situation,

lower maximum velocity for a given wall shear rate than the Couette solution, is shifted up

in Re. This is a small change, but here W eσ and Ex are just on the edge of where polymer

stress can compete with viscous stress. Furthermore, drag reduction can be directly seen in

the streamwise velocities, the maximum value of which increases from the Newtonian value

for suﬃciently high Ex and W eσ, as seen in Fig. 3.

(El = 0.15, Ex = 2, β = 0.97).

Although the results have begun to reveal the structural mechanisms of drag reduction,

many questions remain. Most importantly, the relation between the largest Liapunov ex-

ponent and the turbulent structure must be explored further. In particular, we expect that

wider, thicker streamwise vortices are less eﬀective than narrow, thin ones at stretching

material elements, thus explaining the observed shift toward these larger scale structures in

ﬂows of drag-reducing ﬂuids. Also, further work is needed on the dynamical relationship be-

tween the ECS and the coherent structures of turbulence, including broader studies, probing

8

higher values of Ex and Re, of the eﬀects of polymer on the bifurcation structure of wall-

bounded shear ﬂows. This will require abandoning the Picard iteration for a full Newton

iteration for a non-symmetric system with O(106) unknowns. Finally, given that the ECS

provide a well-controlled model of boundary layer turbulence, they can be eﬀectively used

to probe the eﬀects of other rheologically complex drag-reducing ﬂuids such as ﬁber and

surfactant solutions, ultimately leading to a ﬁrm understanding of the interaction between

rheology and turbulence.

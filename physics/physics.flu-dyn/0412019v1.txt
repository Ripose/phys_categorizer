The turbulent Prandtl number has been calculated in the two-loop approximation of the ε ex-
pansion of the stochastic theory of turbulence. The strikingly small value obtained for the two-loop
correction explains the good agreement of the earlier one-loop result with the experiment. This
situation is drastically diﬀerent from other available nontrivial two-loop results, which exhibit cor-
rections of the magnitude of the one-loop term. The reason is traced to the mutual cancellation of
additional divergences appearing in two dimensions which have had a major eﬀect on the results of
previous calculations of other quantities.

INTRODUCTION

The method of renormalization group (RG) in the theory of developed turbulence is currently the most developed
technical means allowing for reorganization of the straightforward perturbation theory, whose huge expansion param-
eter at large Reynolds numbers renders it practically useless. At the same time the physical value of the artiﬁcial
expansion parameter ε introduced in the RG approach is not small either. For some important physical quantities,
such as the critical dimension of the velocity and eﬀective viscosity, it is possible to prove with the use of of Galilei
invariance of the theory that the corresponding series in ε terminate at the linear terms. Therefore, for such quantities
the RG approach yields exact answers coinciding with the prediction of the phenomenological theory of Kolmogorov.
For other interesting quantities, such as the Kolmogorov constant, skewness factor, turbulent Prandtl number and the
like, the series in ε, however, do not terminate. In this context, it has been often suggested that with the aid of the ε
expansions it is not possible to obtain a suﬃciently good estimates of numerical values of these quantities, although
– until recently – there were no calculations extending beyond the ﬁrst order of the perturbation theory (one-loop
approximation). The two-loop calculation of the Kolmogorov constant and the skewness factor in the inertial range
carried out in Ref.
[1] conﬁrmed this pessimistic point of view on the whole: the two-loop contribution turned out
to be practically equal to the one-loop contribution, although the trend of change of the quantities calculated was
correct, i.e. towards the experimental value from the one-loop result.

In Ref.

[1] calculations were carried out for space dimensions d diﬀerent from d = 3 as well. It turned out that
the relative magnitude of the two-loop contribution decreases with the growth of d, and in the limit d → ∞ is of the
order 10 % only. At the same time in the limit d → 2 this contribution grows without limit. Such a behavior of the
coeﬃcients of the ε expansion may be related to that their singularities as functions d lie in the region d ≤ 2. The
nearest singularity at d = 2 is connected with the divergence of some graphs in the limit d → 2, which leads to the
appearance of poles in d − 2 in the coeﬃcients of the ε expansion, and it is just these graphs which turn out to be
responsible for the large value of the two-loop contribution at d = 3. This feature gave rise to the hope that summation
of these singularities may lead to quantitative improvement of the results of the ε expansion in the real dimension
d = 3. Such a summation was successfully carried out in the framework of the RG method with the aid of the account
of the additional UV renormalization of the theory in the vicinity of d = 2 [2]. In the resulting ”improved ε expansion”
the low-order terms are calculated in the usual way at d = 3, while the high-order terms are approximately summed
with the account of their leading singularities in d − 2 (one-loop approximation), then next-to-leading singularities
(two-loop approximation) etc. Calculation of the Kolmogorov constant and skewness factor according to this program
has demonstrated an essential decrease of the relative impact of the two-loop contribution and led to a fairly good
agreement with the experiment [2].

In the present paper we shall analyze to what extent the singularities of the ε expansion show for another important
characteristic quantity of turbulent systems, the turbulent Prandtl number. It was calculated in the framework of the
RG and the ε expansion in Refs.
[3, 4] with rather good agreement with the experiment [5, 6, 7]. We have carried
out a two-loop calculation of the Prandtl number in order to check, whether this agreement is partially coincidental.
Let us remind that the Prandtl number is the dimensionless ratio of the coeﬃcient of kinematic viscosity ν0 to the
coeﬃcient of thermal diﬀusivity κ0. (In the formally identical problem of turbulent diﬀusion the ratio of the coeﬃcients
of kinematic viscosity and diﬀusion is called Schmidt number). For systems with strongly developed turbulence the

process of homogenization of the temperature is strongly accelerated, which is reﬂected in the value of the eﬀective
or turbulent coeﬃcient of thermal diﬀusivity. The ratio of the coeﬃcient of turbulent viscosity and the coeﬃcient of
turbulent thermal diﬀusivity is the turbulent Prandtl number. Contrary to its molecular analog the turbulent Prandtl
number is universal, i.e. does not depend on individual properties of the ﬂuid. For the accurate determination of the
turbulent Prandtl number a set of conditions is required, especially when calculations are carried out in the two-loop
approximation. Therefore, apart from the formulation of the stochastic problem we shall pay the proper attention to
this problem as well.

The present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we remind the main features of the description of passive
advection of a scalar quantity in the stochastic theory of turbulence with special emphasis on the careful deﬁnition
of the turbulent Prandtl number within the model considered. Sec. III is devoted to the analysis of renormalization
and renormalization-group equations of the model. In Sec. IV details of the two-loop calculation are presented. Sec.
V contains analysis of the results and concluding remarks.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL

Turbulent mixing of a passive scalar quantity is described by the equation

∂tψ + (ϕj ∂j)ψ = κ0∆ψ + f .

The ﬁeld ψ(x, t) in Eq. (1) may have the meaning of both the non-uniform temperature (κ0 being the coeﬃcient of
thermal diﬀusivity) and concentration of the particles of the admixture (in this case κ0 is replaced by the coeﬃcient of
diﬀusion). The ﬁeld f (x, t) is the source of the passive scalar ﬁeld. In the stochastic model of turbulence the ﬁeld of
turbulent eddies of the velocity of the incompressible ﬂuid ϕi(x, t) satisﬁes the Navier-Stokes equation with a random
force:

∂tϕi + (ϕj ∂j)ϕi = ν0∆ϕi − ∂iP + Fi ,

where P (t, x) and Fi(t, x) are, respectively, the pressure and the transverse external random force per unit mass. For

is assumed. Here, Pij (k) = δij − kikj/k2 is the transverse projection operator, dF (k) a function of k ≡ |k| and
parameters of the model, and d the dimension of the coordinate space x.

The stochastic problem (1) – (3) is equivalent to the quantum-ﬁeld model with the doubled number of ﬁelds

in the (t, k) representation. The common factor Pij(k) has been omitted in expressions (6) – (7) for simplicity.
Interaction in action (4) corresponds to the three-point vertices −ϕ′(ϕ∂)ϕ = ϕ′
iVijsϕjϕs/2 with the vertex factor
Vijs = i(kjδis + ksδij), and −ψ′(ϕ∂)ψ = ikj ψ′ϕjψ, where k is the wave vector of ﬁelds ϕ′ and ψ′.

Turbulent processes lead to signiﬁcantly faster than in relations (7) and (8) attenuation in time of the response
functions hϕϕ′i and hψψ′i due to the eﬀective replacement of the molecular coeﬃcients of viscosity and thermal
diﬀusivity by their turbulent analogs. At the same time, however, the simple exponential time-dependence is changed
as well (and in a diﬀerent manner for hϕϕ′i and hψψ′i), therefore it is necessary to choose a deﬁnite way of ﬁxing
the ratio of the turbulent transport coeﬃcients, i.e. the Prandtl number (or Schmidt number). Henceforth, we shall
use the following deﬁnition. Consider the Dyson equations for the response functions in the wave-vector-frequency
representation:

where Σ are the corresponding self-energy operators, and introduce the inverse eﬀective Prandtl number uef f by the
relation

uef f ≡

Γψψ′ (k, ω = 0)
Γϕϕ′(k, ω = 0)

.

Further, we shall be interested in the inertial range L−1 ≪ k ≪ Λ (here, L is the external scale of turbulence and Λ−1
the characteristic length of the dissipating eddies) in which the quantity uef f is independent of the wave number k.

III. RENORMALIZATION OF THE MODEL AND THE RG REPRESENTATION

The self-energy operators Σϕ′,ϕ(k, ω) and Σψ′ψ(k, ω) appearing in Eqs. (9) and (10) may be found in model (4)
in perturbation theory. However, the expansion parameter turns out to be very large for developed turbulence (for
ΛL ≫ 1). The renormalization-group method allows to carry out a resummation in the straightforward perturbation
theory. To apply it, it is necessary to use in relation (3) ”the pumping function” dF (k) of a special form

dF (k) = D0k4−d−2ε.

In the infrared region the power function (12) is assumed to be cut oﬀ at wave numbers k ≤ m ≡ L−1. The quantity
ε > 0 in Eq. (12) is the formal small expansion parameter in the RG approach with the value ε = 2 corresponding to
the physical model.

The usual perturbation theory is a series in powers of the charge g0 ≡ D0/ν3

0 dimensionless at ε = 0 (logarithmic
theory). At ε → 0 ultraviolet divergences are brought about in the graphs of the perturbation theory which show
in the form of poles in ε. Due to Galilei invariance of the model divergences at d > 2 are present only in the one-
irreducible functions hϕϕ′i and hψψ′i and are of the form ϕ′∆ϕ and ψ′∆ψ. At d = 2 also the one-irreducible function
hϕ′ϕ′i diverges. For d > 2 the renormalized action may be written as

It is obtained from action (4) by the multiplicative renormalization of the parameters of the model:

ν0 = νZν,

g0 = gµ2εZg,

u0 = uZu, Zu = Z1Z

(13)

with two independent renormalization constants Zν and Z1. The quantities ν and g in Eq. (13) are the renormalized
analogs of the coeﬃcient of viscosity and the coupling constant (the charge g being dimensionless). The renormalization
mass µ is an arbitrary parameter of the renormalized theory, and the pumping function dF (k) (12) determining the
correlation function of the random force DF (3) is assumed to be expressed in terms of the renormalized parameters:

dF (k) = g0ν3

0 k4−d−2ε = gµ2εν3k4−d−2ε.

The dissipative wave number Λ is determined by g0 according to the relation Λ = g1/2ε
the quantity µ. Thus, the inertial range we are interested in corresponds to the condition s ≡ k/µ ≪ 1.

The correlation functions of the renormalized theory do not contain poles in ε. This feature, however, does not
solve the problem of ﬁnding the infrared asymptotics s ≡ k/µ → 0, because the corresponding perturbation theory
is a series in the parameter s−2ε growing without limit in the region we are interested in. The problem is solved by
passing to the RG representation. To use it for the response functions (9) and (10), rewrite them in the renormalized
variables in the form

where the dimensionless functions Rϕ and Rψ of dimensionless arguments s, g, and u are given by the expressions

Γϕϕ′(k, ω = 0) = νk2Rϕ(s, g),
Γψψ′(k, ω = 0) = uνk2Rψ(s, g, u),

Rϕ(s, g) = Zν −

Γψψ′ (k, ω = 0) = ¯u¯νk2Rψ(s = 1, ¯g, ¯u) ,

The RG representation for functions (16) is determined by the relations

where ¯g = ¯g(s, g), ¯ν = ¯ν(s, g, ν), and ¯u = ¯u(s, g, u) are invariant variables satisfying RG equations of the form

− s∂s + βg∂g + βu∂u − γν ν∂ν

b(s, g, u) = 0,

and normalized by the conditions ¯g(1, g) = g, ¯ν(1, g, ν) = ν, and ¯u(1, g, u) = u. The RG functions β and γ are deﬁned
by the renormalization constants according to the relations

As shown in the one-loop approximation in Ref.

[4, 8, 9], the invariant charges ¯g(s, g) and ¯u(s, g, u) in the limit
s → 0 tend to the infrared-stable ﬁxed point: ¯g(s, g) → g∗ = O(ε), ¯u(s, g, u) → u∗ = O(ε0), and the invariant
viscosity has the powerlike asymptotic behavior

IV. TWO-LOOP CALCULATION OF THE PRANDTL NUMBER

The expansion of the functions Rϕ and Rψ (17) in the coupling constant g is of the form

Here, the quantities Aϕ and Aψ are determined by the one-loop contribution to Σϕ′ϕ and Σψ′ψ, whereas the coeﬃcients
11 and a(1)
a(ν)
11 of representation (14) of the renormalization constants Zν and Z1 are found from the condition of UV
ﬁniteness of expressions (21). Substituting relations (21) in Eq. (20) we obtain

Bearing in mind that g∗ = O(ε), we see that to ﬁnd uef f at the leading order of the ε expansion, it is enough to know
the charge u∗ in the one-loop approximation. At the second order, apart from the more accurate values of u∗ and g∗,
it is necessary to calculate the coeﬃcients aϕ and aψ(u∗) of the expansion of the scaling functions (17) and (21) at
the leading order in ε as well.

The location of the ﬁxed point (g∗, u∗) is determined by the conditions βg(g∗) = βu(g∗, u∗) = 0. The nontrivial

ﬁxed point with g∗ 6= 0 is infrared stable [4], and from Eq. (19) the relations

The UV-ﬁniteness of the RG functions γ(g, u) from Eq. (19) allows to express them in terms of the coeﬃcient of

the ﬁrst-order pole in ε in expression (14) for the renormalization constants:

The renormalization constant Zν at the second order of perturbation theory and the corresponding expression for γν
were obtained in Ref. [1]. For g∗ from Eq. (24) the result is:

We now turn to the calculation of the constants B, aψ and aϕ which determine the Prandtl number. In the one-loop
approximation the quantities Σϕ′ϕ and Σψ′ψ are represented by the graphs depicted in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.
In the one-loop self-energy graphs of Figs. 1 and 2, the lines correspond to propagators (6), (7) and (8) with the

in Figs. 1 and 2 correspond to the factors Vijs = i(kj δis + ksδij) and ikj, respectively. Upon contraction of indices,
integration over time and introduction of dimensionless wave vector (in units of the external wave vector p) in the
integrals we obtain

It is convenient to ﬁnd the two-loop contributions to the renormalization constant Z1 from the condition that the

quantity Rψ from Eq. (17) is UV ﬁnite in the limit k → 0. In terms of the reduced quantity

this condition may be cast in the form

Σ ≡ lim
k→0

Σψ′,ψ(ω = 0, k)
uνk2

Z1(ε) − Σ(ε) = O(ε0).

The limit k → 0 in expression (41) does exist, provided the IR regularization of the graphs has been taken care of.
In the MS scheme renormalization constants do not depend on the method of such regularization. With our choice of
the pumping function (12) it is accomplished by the cutoﬀ of the propagator hϕϕi0 (6) at k < m.

Let us choose further the wave vector of integration such that in the lines hϕϕi0 it ﬂows alone (for the graphs Σψ′,ψ
such a choice is always possible). Then integration over all the wave numbers will be carried out within the limits
from m to ∞.

The one-loop contribution to Σ is determined by the graph of Fig. 2 as:

Substituting relation (44) in Eq. (42) and requiring cancellation of pole contributions in the linear in g approximation,
we return to expression (29) for a(1)
11 . The terms of order g2 are required for the calculation of the renormalization
constant in the two-loop approximation.

The two-loop contribution Σ(2) to the self-energy operator Σψ′ψ is determined by the sum of the graphs depicted in
Fig. 3 [normalization according to Eq. (41) is implied]. When substituting propagators (6), (7) and (8) – expressed
in terms of the renormalized variables – in the graphs of Fig. 3 it is possible to put Zν = Z1 = 1 with the necessary
accuracy. Contracting indices and integrating over time we obtain

For the functions fi(z, k/q) with i = 2, 5...8 the equations fi(z, 0) = fi(z, ∞) = 0 hold revealing that integrals over k
and q in Eq. (54) are separately convergent, so that the divergence at ε → 0 in the corresponding Σi is brought about
by the region, in which k and q tend to inﬁnity simultaneously. As a consequence, the second-order pole is absent in
such Σi: ai = 0 for i = 2, 5...8.

For Σi with i = 1, 3, 4 fi(z, ∞) = 0 as before, which means absence of divergence in the integral over k in Eq.
(54). For these graphs, however, fi(z, 0) = const 6= 0, so that the integral over q diverges at ε → 0 leading to the
appearance of the pole of second order in the full integral.

Expressions (55) may be simpliﬁed with the use of the identity

following from Eq. (56). Calculating the right-hand side of Eq. (58) with the aid of relations (55) and introducing

This operation has reduced the number of iterated integrations and allowed for explicit extraction one pole in ε. For
i = 2, 5...8 the integral in Eq. (59) is ﬁnite for ε = 0 and determines the residue of the ﬁrst-order pole:

ai = 0,

i = 2, 5...8.

(60)

For Σi(ε) with i = 1, 3, 4 the coeﬃcient of the second-order pole is obtained by the replacement of the function
[fi(ξ, κ) + fi(ξ, 1/κ)] in the integrand in Eq. (59) by its limiting value at κ → ∞: fi(ξ, ∞) + fi(ξ, 0) = fi(ξ, 0) [we
remind that fi(z, ∞) = 0]. Then integration over κ becomes trivial, which yields

V. CONCLUSION

11

The main conclusion to be drawn from the two-loop value of the eﬀective inverse Prandtl number (64) obtained in
the present paper is that the correction term is strikingly small. Even at the real value ε = 2 it is only 7% of the
leading contribution. Apparently this is the reason of the favorable comparison of the one-loop value of the turbulent
Prandtl number 0.72 [3, 4] with the experiment: the recent circular-jet result 0.81 ± 0.05 [6] is corroborated by the
experimentally recommended value 0.8 for modeling and once more conﬁrmed the range 0.7 – 0.9 of measured values
[7] which has been put forward, however, quite a while ago [5]. In view of these numbers it may be concluded that the
already fairly good one-loop result is improved by the two-loop correction, whose account (65) leads to the value 0.77
for the turbulent Prandtl number. At the same time this result is somewhat unexpected – similar two-loop corrections
to the Kolmogorov constant and the skewness factor are large [1].

In the results obtained there are, however, also signiﬁcant features common with the calculation [1]. From Table I
8
i=1 bi is close to
of coeﬃcients bi we see that b5 has the largest value while the value of the whole sum B
that of b5 alone. The graph Σ5, which gives rise to this coeﬃcient, is the only one of the two-loop graphs of Fig. 3
possessing a singularity in space dimension d = 2. Exactly the same situation was encountered also in Ref. [1] in the
two-loop calculation of the constant λ ≃ −1.101 in Eq. (28). It is a rather unexpected observation that for terms in
the factor M = λ − 800B/3 ≃ 0.010 from Eq. (32) (d = 3) an almost complete numerical cancellation takes place.
To clarify the situation, we calculated asymptotics of the graph Σ5 at d → 2 with the result: b5 ≃ −1/1024(d − 2).
Substitution of this expression together with the analogous one for λ from Eq. (28) in the factor M (d) reveals that
the singular in d − 2 contributions indeed cancel, so that this factor and with it the whole two-loop contribution to
the Prandtl number are ﬁnite at d = 2! It should be noted that also in the second term of the two-loop contribution
to uef f [see Eq. (32)] a signiﬁcant decrease in magnitude takes place in the diﬀerence aϕ − aψ of the contributions
from renormalization of viscosity and thermal diﬀusivity compared with the magnitudes of these terms separately.

Thus, our results complement the conclusion made in Ref. [1]. In the two-loop approximation the main contribution
is due to graphs having a singularity at d = 2 and it is necessary to sum such graphs. For quantities in which this
singularity is absent the two-loop contribution is relatively small.

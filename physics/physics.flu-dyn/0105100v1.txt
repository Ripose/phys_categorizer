Abstract. The dynamic model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent ﬂows requires test ﬁl-
tering the resolved velocity ﬁelds in order to determine model coeﬃcients. However, test ﬁltering is
costly to perform in large-eddy simulation of complex geometry ﬂows, especially on unstructured
grids. The objective of this work is to develop and test an approximate but less costly dynamic
procedure which does not require test ﬁltering. The proposed method is based on Taylor series
expansions of the resolved velocity ﬁelds. Accuracy is governed by the derivative schemes used
in the calculation and the number of terms considered in the approximation to the test ﬁltering
operator. The expansion is developed up to fourth order, and results are tested a priori based
on direct numerical simulation data of forced isotropic turbulence in the context of the dynamic
Smagorinsky model. The tests compare the dynamic Smagorinsky coeﬃcient obtained from ﬁl-
tering with those obtained from application of the Taylor series expansion. They show that the
expansion up to second order provides a reasonable approximation to the true dynamic coeﬃcient
(with errors on the order of about 5% for c2
s), but that including higher-order terms does not nec-
essarily lead to improvements in the results due to inherent limitations in accurately evaluating
high-order derivatives. A posteriori tests using the Taylor series approximation in LES of forced
isotropic turbulence and channel ﬂow conﬁrm that the Taylor series approximation yields accu-
rate results for the dynamic coeﬃcient. Moreover, the simulations are stable and yield accurate
resolved velocity statistics.

1. Introduction

In large-eddy simulation (LES), the Navier–Stokes equations are ﬁltered in an attempt to isolate the
large-scale motion in a turbulent ﬂow. The ﬁltered equations contain the divergence of the sub-grid
scale (SGS) stress,

which has a smoothing action on the scales smaller than ∆. Analogous to the closure problem related
to the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, the SGS stress τij must be modeled using available
ﬁltered quantities. A variety of SGS models exist (Piomelli, 1999; Meneveau and Katz, 2000), but the
results largely depend upon the choice of model coeﬃcients, and the latter often have to be tuned from
one ﬂow regime to another. The dynamic procedure introduced by Germano et al. (1991) avoids such
ad-hoc tuning. A crucial step in the dynamic procedure is using a ﬁltering operation, called test ﬁltering,
to gather information about the smallest resolved scales. The test ﬁltering operation, denoted by (¯),
is deﬁned in a similar way to the grid ﬁlter, except the ﬁlter acts on a larger scale α∆:

(the superscript “f ” in both tensors refers to “ﬁltering”—to be later contrasted to Taylor series ap-
e
proximations). In (7), for simplicity, we have put α in place of the ratio of the ‘compound’ ﬁlter length
to the grid ﬁlter length, where ‘compound’ ﬁlter length is the eﬀective length scale of the ﬁlter obtained
by sequentially applying the grid and test ﬁlters. The error in doing so is tolerable for typical values
of α and one can calculate the precise form of this ratio after choosing a speciﬁc type of test ﬁlter and
assuming a form for the implicit grid ﬁlter. The reader is referred to Winckelmans et al. (1998) for
further discussion. The averaging in (5) may be done over directions of statistical homogeneity (Ger-
mano et al., 1991), if any exist. In complex geometries without homogeneous directions, the Lagrangian
dynamic model (Meneveau et al., 1996), which calculates time averages along pathlines, can be used.
In the present work, only turbulence with statistically homogeneous directions will be considered for
simplicity. Hence, spatial averaging is employed in all applications.

However, from a practical perspective, test ﬁltering adds computational cost to LES. The cost is
typically manageable when dealing with pseudo-spectral numerical methods, where ﬁlter operations can
be performed in Fourier space. When using physical-space based test ﬁltering approaches (e.g. in ﬁnite-
diﬀerence or ﬁnite-volume codes with structured grids), the operation count depends upon the number
of neighboring grid-points involved in the ﬁltering. Najjar and Tafti (1996) give a discussion of the eﬀects
of using test ﬁlters with ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximations and implications for the dynamic Smagorinsky

model. When dealing with complex-geometry ﬂows, unstructured grids are often employed for which one
must decide which neighboring nodes are involved in the ﬁltering. Challenges also arise when seeking
parallelization. These diﬃculties have somewhat limited the applicability of the dynamic model to LES
of complex-geometry ﬂows. Various ﬁltering operators for unstructured grids have already been proposed
and tested, in several papers by Jansen (1994, 1999). He discusses and compares several options, including
derivative based ﬁltering, and generalized top-hat ﬁltering (Jansen, 1999). The generalized top-hat ﬁlter
is a natural extension of the top-hat ﬁlter to unstructured grids by averaging over all elements that
share a particular node. Filtering methods for complex geometries have also been discussed by Mullen
and Fischer (1999).

The derivative-based ﬁlter approximates the function to be test ﬁltered by expanding it locally in
a Taylor series and truncating. This method is attractive because typical codes already have eﬃcient
methods in place to evaluate derivatives (as opposed to ﬁltering, which is not typically needed in most
existing codes). As reviewed in Meneveau and Katz (2000), the idea of expanding the local velocity
ﬁeld in a Taylor series has been used before in SGS modeling, mainly to simplify modeling terms for
the similarity model and/or the Leonard stresses (Leonard, 1974; Clark et al., 1979; Liu et al., 1994;
Winckelmans et al., 1998), and also in the context of so-called deﬁltering SGS models (Stolz and Adams,
1999; Kuerten et al., 1999). In the context of the dynamic Smagorinsky model, Taylor series expansion
was originally suggested by Gao and O’Brien (1993) to analytically study the limit α → 1, but was not
applied or extended in LES. As mentioned above, the derivative based ﬁlter (or Taylor series approach)
was one of the options tested by Jansen (1999), although no detailed results are presented for this
approach. Jansen has used generalized top-hat ﬁltering in his dynamic LES of airfoil ﬂow because this
method has been found to be cheaper than the Taylor series method and yet gives similar accuracy
(Jansen, 1999), in the context of his speciﬁc code. The derivative based method has also been used to
perform a priori studies of the sensitivity of various SGS models to the type of test ﬁltering employed
(Sagaut and Grohens, 1999).

In the present paper we focus on the Taylor series method because it is a fairly general approach
which can be formulated, studied, and tested in general, less code-speciﬁc terms. Section 2 describes
the formulation of the approach, in which the dynamic Smagorinsky coeﬃcient is expressed entirely in
terms of derivatives of the resolved velocity ﬁeld and no test ﬁltering is required. The accuracy of this
approach is tested both a priori (§ 3) as well as a posteriori in LES of two benchmark ﬂows, namely
forced isotropic turbulence and minimal channel ﬂow (§ 4). Structured grids are used both for the direct
numerical simulation (DNS) used in the a priori tests and in the LES runs, in order to allow us to
make comparisons in a highly controlled and standard numerical environment. Basic conclusions are
presented in § 5.

For an isotropic ﬁlter, we write Gα∆(y) = Gα∆(|y|), and all terms with n odd vanish, so that we can
take n = 2m. The choice of an isotropic ﬁlter also eﬀects the remaining terms since they all become
isotropic tensors. Since derivatives can only be calculated to a limited accuracy, and we are forced to
truncate the Taylor series, this method yields an approximation to the ﬁltering operation. By varying

the number of terms used in the Taylor series, and the way derivatives are calculated, the accuracy of
this approximation can be varied.

is given although the approach can be extended to any isotropic ﬁlter with ﬁnite moments (this excludes
the spectral cutoﬀ ﬁlter, which has inﬁnite second moments). Additionally, up to second order only,
the following is also valid for the box ﬁlter, since the second moments of the Gaussian and box ﬁlters
are the same. This means that the rest of the development in this section, up to second order only, can
also be applied when using the box ﬁlter. This fact is used later in §4.2, where the box ﬁlter is used
to perform test ﬁltering. Restricting attention to the Gaussian ﬁlter, the moments in (8) can easily be
evaluated as

In the case of isotropic turbulence, the test ﬁltering is done in three dimensions, so that the values of
the indices k and m in (18) are 1, 2, 3, and the averaging in the numerator and denominator is volume
averaging. However, in the case of channel ﬂow, in order to approximate planar (in x-z planes) instead
of volumetric ﬁltering, the Laplacian term in the expansion of (8) only contains derivatives in the x
and z directions (i. e. the indices k and m in (18) and (19) only cycle over the two values k = 1, 3 and
m = 1,3). Additionally, in the channel ﬂow case, plane averaging of the numerator and denominator of
(18) is performed in the x-z planes.

3. A priori tests

3.1. Methods

The a priori tests are done using a 1283 DNS database of forced isotropic turbulence at Rλ ≈ 94,
produced using the same pseudo-spectral algorithm as in Cerutti and Meneveau (1998). The grid ﬁlter
size, ∆, is chosen to be the grid spacing of a 323 grid, and corresponds to ∆/η ∼ 9, where η is the
Kolmogorov scale. To perform the data analysis on the 323 grid, the 1283 DNS data is grid ﬁltered (using
the Gaussian ﬁlter) and stored back on the DNS grid. Then, the grid-ﬁltered velocity is ﬁltered using
a spectral cutoﬀ ﬁlter of width ∆ (the same as the 323 grid spacing) so that no aliasing occurs when
transferring the velocity to the 323 grid. The grid-ﬁltered velocity, on the coarse grid, is then used to
calculate the ﬁltered rate of strain tensor using ﬁnite diﬀerences. The model coeﬃcient c2
s is calculated
using the approximations (15), (16), and (17), and is compared to values obtained by explicitly applying
a test ﬁlter. The series (14) must be truncated, so here two levels of accuracy are considered: second
order and fourth order. The second order approximation (denoted as T = 2) is obtained by keeping
terms O(∆2) and lower in (14), so only the ﬁrst term in (15), and only the ﬁrst two terms inside the
curly braces in (16) are kept. The fourth order approximation (denoted as T = 4) is obtained in an
analogous way and contains all of the explicitly shown terms in (15) and (16).

At both levels of accuracy, all of the derivatives required to implement the derivative-based test
ﬁltering are initially calculated using centered ﬁnite diﬀerences accurate to second order (denoted as
D = 2). These derivatives could be calculated spectrally, however the goal here is to examine how
the derivative-based method performs when derivatives are calculated as they would be in a complex
geometry situation. In an attempt to separate the errors due to truncating the series (14) and ﬁnite
diﬀerencing errors, fourth order ﬁnite diﬀerences (denoted as D = 4) are also tried for calculating
derivatives. This allows one to keep the ﬁlter size constant while the accuracy of the ﬁnite diﬀerences
is changed.

A coarse 323 grid is used to store the grid-ﬁltered velocity during the a priori test, so that all
subsequent calculations would be the same as if a LES was actually being performed. This is also
consistent with the choice of grid ﬁlter size. The ratio of the widths associated with the test ﬁlter and
the grid ﬁlter, α, is varied between 2, 3, and 4, though in this study, the most attention is given to the
common choice α = 2.

Finally, the approximations (15) and (16) are calculated to the desired level of accuracy and the
results are used in (5) to calculate c2
s. Spatial averaging is employed in (5) because of the spatial
homogeneity of the velocity ﬁeld under consideration. Note that since (15) and (16) contain products
of velocity components, they also contain aliasing errors. However, these were not removed since it is
assumed that methods to do so may not be available during a typical LES of a complex geometry ﬂow.

3.2. Results

The results obtained from using the Taylor series approximations are compared to those obtained by
performing the classical test ﬁltering. The comparison is based on scatter plots of tensor element values
for some representative cases, and on correlation coeﬃcients and normalized mean square errors among
individual tensor elements. The correlation coeﬃcient for a given tensor element is deﬁned as

3.2.1. Second order approximation

In this section, the results obtained by using the second order approximation (T = 2) and second order
ﬁnite diﬀerencing (D = 2) are presented. Here, the parameter α is ﬁxed at the common value of 2; eﬀects
of varying α are discussed in § 3.2.5. First, we compare the results for the components Lij obtained using
the two methods. Scatter plots comparing the 2nd order approximation to the exact (ﬁlter-based) results
are shown in Figure 1 for a diagonal and an oﬀ-diagonal component of Lij. Both plots indicate that the
2nd order approximation is overall quite good, but has a tendency to under-estimate the magnitude of
the L-components for small |Lij|, but over-estimates the magnitude at larger |Lij|.

As shown in the ﬁrst column of Table 1, the 2nd order approximation is well correlated (ρ ∼ 0.95)
with the exact results, and the normalized square error between the two is ∼ 6% for diagonal terms
and ∼ 15% for oﬀ-diagonal terms.

Scatter plots of components of Mij obtained using the 2nd order approximation and the exact results
are shown in Figure 2, from which it can be seen that the approximation is very good. As shown in
Table 1, the 2nd order approximation for the Mij is very highly correlated with the exact values, with
ρ ∼ 0.99. The normalized mean square is signiﬁcantly lower than it was for the Lij, being ∼ 1% for
diagonal terms and ∼ 0.5% for oﬀ-diagonal terms.

Using the approximate and exact results for Lij and Mij in Equation (5), and using volume averaging
gives the values of c2
s shown in the last entries of Table 1. The relative error in c2
s obtained by using
the 2nd order approximation is ∼ 5%. Since the value of the coeﬃcient obtained in the present work is
essentially the same as for the standard ﬁltering approach, the dissipation characteristics will be the
same as for the standard ﬁlter-based dynamic model.

3.2.2. Fourth order approximation

To answer the question of whether one can improve on the 5% relative error of the 2nd order approximation
by including higher order terms, a priori tests are done with the 4th order approximation (T = 4, but
still D = 2). As in the 2nd order case above, we ﬁx α = 2 here. Beginning with the components of
Lij, the scatter plots in Figure 3 show that the 4th order approximation tends to under-estimate the
magnitude of the components of Lij. Despite this, the correlation coeﬃcient between the 4th order and
exact results, shown in the second column of Table 1 to be ∼ 0.98, is higher than it was between the
2nd order and exact results. Additionally, the normalized square error between the approximation and
exact results for the Lij, also in Table 1, is lower overall with an improvement in the oﬀ-diagonal terms
outweighing a slight increase in the error of the diagonal terms. Note that with the use of the 4th order

7

approximation, there is no longer a large discrepancy between the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal terms, as
was observed when the 2nd order approximation was used, as the normalized square error is ∼ 7%.

For Mij, Figure 4 shows scatter plots obtained with the 4th order approximation, which now shows
a slight tendency to over-estimate the magnitude of Mij. The correlation coeﬃcient is seen in table 1
to remain high, at ∼ 0.99. However, the normalized square error for the Mij components is increased
signiﬁcantly to ∼ 3% for both diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal terms by using the 4th order approximation.
This is an increase from 1% for diagonal terms and 0.5% from the oﬀ-diagonal terms, which were
s obtained with the 4th order
obtained with the 2nd order approximation. As a result, the value of c2
approximation has a relative error of ∼ 27%. This is signiﬁcantly worse than the results obtained using
the 2nd order approximation.

There are two likely reasons why the 4th order approximation gives inferior results. The ﬁrst is
that the ﬁnite diﬀerence errors in the 2nd order terms are swamping the 4th order correction. In other
words, due to the second-order ﬁnite diﬀerencing (D = 2), the error in ∂k
uj in Equation 15 is
O(∆4)—the same order as the 4th order correction. The second possible reason is that the ﬁltered
velocity ﬁeld is simply not smooth enough to allow reliable calculation of high order derivatives through
ﬁnite diﬀerencing. This issue is an inherent, well-known diﬃculty associated with LES velocity ﬁelds
that have a Kolmogorov energy spectrum. Even after removing some energy near the grid-scale through
the implicit grid ﬁlter, gradients are still dominated by modes very near the scale ∆. Also note that
the main problems seem to be associated with the error in the 4th order Mij terms, which contain the
highest order velocity derivatives. These two possibilities are examined in more detail below.

the 4th order correction, more a priori tests were done using O(∆4) ﬁnite diﬀerences to evaluate the
2nd order terms. This ensures that the ﬁnite diﬀerence truncation error from the 2nd order terms is
now of higher order than the 4th order correction terms. To compare the relative importance of ﬁnite
diﬀerencing error and the error associated with truncation in the Taylor series method, we consider the
form of the leading error terms. This is done in one dimension only for simplicity. In the case T = D = 2,
the expansion with ﬁnite diﬀerences is

f (x) =

In the case T = 2, D = 4, we see that the leading error term is simply the fourth order correction term
in the Taylor series expansion of the test ﬁltering operator (the (α∆)4/1152 term). While in the case
T = D = 4, the leading error term is of higher order than the fourth order correction in the expansion
of the test ﬁltering operator (it is ∝ ∆6). When α = 2, the ﬁnite diﬀerence error is larger, though of
the same order of magnitude as the correction term for the test ﬁlter expansion.

The results for the Lij and Mij components, again for α = 2, are summarized in the third and fourth
columns of Table 1. For the 2nd order approximation, although the correlation coeﬃcients remain nearly
the same as when the 2nd order ﬁnite diﬀerences were used, the normalized square error for Lij shows
s for the 2nd
a signiﬁcant increase, while it shows a smaller increase for Mij. The resulting error in c2

8

Chester, Charlette, and Meneveau

order approximation with 4th order ﬁnite diﬀerences is much larger (37%) than when 2nd order ﬁnite
diﬀerences are used. When the 4th order correction terms are included, evaluated with 4th order ﬁnite
diﬀerences, the correlation coeﬃcients for the Lij and Mij components do not change signiﬁcantly.
In contrast, the normalized square error for the Lij obtained with the 4th order approximation and
4th order diﬀerences is decreased signiﬁcantly from both the 2nd order case with the 4th order ﬁnite
diﬀerences and the 4th order case with only 2nd order ﬁnite diﬀerences. The normalized square errors for
the Mij calculated using 4th order ﬁnite diﬀerences are increased from both the 2nd order approximation
with 4th order ﬁnite diﬀerences, and the 4th order approximation with 2nd order ﬁnite diﬀerences. This
shows that use of O(∆4) ﬁnite diﬀerences can reduce error in using the 4th order approximation, but
overall the results are not as good as when just 2nd order ﬁnite diﬀerences are used to implement the
2nd order approximation. Since the leading error term in (23) is at higher than fourth order, the above
analysis of the error terms does not clearly explain the worsening of results in going from T = D = 2 to
T = D = 4. A more intuitive analysis based on the roughness of the underlying velocity ﬁelds is given
in the following section (§ 3.2.4).

3.2.4. Eﬀects of smoothness

As a check to see under what conditions the 4th order approximation does give better results than the
2nd order approximation, the a priori tests are repeated with velocity ﬁelds of varying smoothness.
A smoother velocity ﬁeld allows more accurate calculation of high order derivatives, and also yields
smaller errors in truncating the Taylor series. As a simple way to adjust the smoothness of the velocity
ﬁeld, an additional Gaussian ﬁlter is applied to the DNS data before performing the a priori tests. The
width of this additional ﬁlter, or preﬁlter, is varied between ∆ and 8∆. This analysis is done here only
to illustrate trends and is not proposed as a practical method in a simulation where we wish to avoid
the need for ﬁltering in the ﬁrst place.

The results obtained with the preﬁlter width set to 4∆ are summarized in the ﬁfth column of Table 1.
When 2nd order ﬁnite diﬀerences are used, it is seen that the normalized mean square error is increased
for some components by going from the 2nd order approximation to the 4th order approximation. The
relative error in c2
s is still higher for the 4th order approximation. The results obtained by using both
4th order ﬁnite diﬀerences and preﬁltering are shown in the sixth column of Table 1. In this case, the
normalized mean square error for the Lij components is decreased, while the results are mixed for the
Mij. The ﬁnal value of c2
s, as seen in Table 1 in this case does show an improvement in going from the
2nd order approximation to the 4th order approximation. This trend becomes more pronounced as the
size of the preﬁlter is increased further. It is important to note that the resulting coeﬃcients should not
be compared to those obtained without preﬁltering, because the velocity ﬁeld in this case is actually
diﬀerent (it has been artiﬁcially smoothed out by the preﬁlter).

We conclude that only when the velocity ﬁeld is very smooth does the use of the 4th order approxi-
mation yield more accurate results. However, this is not typically the case as LES ﬁelds are inherently
somewhat rough. This result suggests that under typical circumstances, the 4th order approximation
will yield poor results when compared to the 2nd order approximation.

3.2.5. Eﬀect of varying α

To examine how the size of the test ﬁlter aﬀects the accuracy of the derivative based method, a priori
tests are done with α = 3 and 4, in addition to the base case of α = 2 discussed above. The derivatives in
these tests are calculated using 2nd order ﬁnite diﬀerences and keeping the truncation to the second-order
(i. e. D = 2 and T = 2). Since the derivative based method is based on truncating a Taylor series, one
expects that the method will give better results for smaller values of α, for a given ∆. The correlation
coeﬃcients and normalized square errors for Lij and Mij are shown in the last two columns of Table 1.
For α = 3, the correlation coeﬃcients for Lij and Mij are decreased from their values obtained with
α = 2. The normalized square error of the Lij obtained for the 2nd order approximation with α = 3 are
increased dramatically over those obtained with α = 2, especially the oﬀ-diagonal terms, which show
errors ∼ 120%. For the Mij, the error obtained with the 2nd order approximation also shows a large

Dynamic Model for LES Without Test Filtering: Quantifying the Accuracy of Taylor Series Approximations

9

increase in error compared to the case α = 2. The ﬁnal results for c2
s are given in Table 1, and they show
that the case α = 3 has a 6.41% relative error. Considering the errors in the individual components of
Lij and Mij, this result is surprisingly good, but is most likely due to fortuitous cancellation of errors.
As seen in the last column in Table 1, for α = 4 the correlation coeﬃcients for the Lij are decreased
from the α = 2 and α = 3 cases. The correlation coeﬃcients for the Mij are also decreased when
choosing α = 4. The mean square error for both the Lij and the Mij is increased signiﬁcantly in the
α = 4 case. The error for c2
s obtained with α = 4 is seen to be very large. Analysis of the higher-order
case (T = 4, not shown) yields even larger errors. These a priori tests show that the Taylor series
approximation to test ﬁltering yields unsatisfactory results for α & 3 in this isotropic turbulent ﬂow.

4. A posteriori tests

As a complement to the results of the a priori tests, a posteriori tests are used to compare the Taylor
series based dynamic model to the traditional method based on test ﬁltering. The tests are done by
performing LES of both forced isotropic turbulence and channel ﬂow. Since the best results in the a
priori tests were obtained by truncating the Taylor series expansions at second order, all a posteriori
tests are done using T = 2 and D = 2.

4.1. LES of Forced Isotropic Turbulence

u ×

To test the derivative-based method in isotropic turbulence, the pseudo-spectral DNS code is modiﬁed
to perform LES on a 643 grid. This includes adding a 3/2-rule dealiasing procedure, which is applied
ω) and not the SGS stress
only to the nonlinear term in the ﬁltered Navier-Stokes equations (
term. This is done because the nonlinear term is known to be exact, while the SGS term is already an
approximation. In addition, the type of nonlinearity contained in the SGS stress term is not completely
removed by standard dealiasing procedures such as the 3/2-rule or random phase shifts. Simulations
are forced with a constant energy injection rate (as in Cerutti and Meneveau, 1998) of ε = 0.0007, the
molecular viscosity is ν = 10−6, and the domain is of length L = 2π. At statistical steady state, the
Taylor-scale Reynolds number of the ﬂow is Rλ ≈ 2100. Simulations using both exact test ﬁltering and
the Taylor series based method are performed. As with the a priori tests, a Gaussian test ﬁlter is used
at scale 2∆ (corresponding to α = 2). The exact test ﬁltering is done in Fourier space, while the Taylor
series method uses second order ﬁnite diﬀerences to calculate all of the derivatives associated with the
dynamic procedure. The initial condition is a random ﬁeld with a k−5/3 spectrum and random phases.
Volume averaging is used in this spatially homogeneous ﬂow.

Figure 5(a) shows the time evolution of cs for exact test ﬁltering and the derivative based approach.
Although the derivative based method consistently gives a value of cs roughly 5 % higher than the
exact method (in contrast to the a-priori tests), both methods relax from the initial value (cs(0) = 0,
as expected for Gaussian ﬁelds) to their quasi-steady value at about the same rate. Most importantly,
the calculation done using the derivative based method is seen to be stable. The quasi-steady values for
both methods lie near cs ≈ 0.13 and are lower than the value of cs ≈ 0.16 often observed in isotropic
turbulence. This may be a result of using a Gaussian ﬁlter. As shown in Figure 5(b), the radial energy
spectra obtained from the two methods are essentially the same, only showing a slight diﬀerence at
high wavenumber due to the slightly diﬀerent values of cs. Both cases agree well with the Kolmogorov
−5/3 prediction, with cK = 1.6.

4.2. Application to channel ﬂow

To examine the eﬀects of anisotropy and the presence of walls on the derivative-based procedure,
moderate Reynolds number channel ﬂow simulations are performed with a LES version of the DNS
code NTMIX3D (Stoessel, 1995). In this code for fully compressible ﬂow, the governing equations are
integrated using an explicit third order Runge Kutta time advancement and a sixth order compact

10

ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme (Lele, 1992). No slip isothermal boundary conditions are used at the top and
bottom boundaries, while periodic boundary conditions are used in the streamwise (x) and spanwise
(z) directions (which are homogeneous directions). A driving source term compensates the shear stress
at the walls which allows to run the simulations using periodicity in the x direction. A computational
domain of size Lx = 2π, Ly = 2 (= 2δ), and Lz = 0.908 in the three directions is used. The x, y, and
z coordinates belong to the intervals 0 ≤ x ≤ Lx, −Ly/2 ≤ y ≤ Ly/2, and 0 ≤ z ≤ Lz.

The shear Reynolds number (based on friction velocity uτ and channel half width δ) is Reτ = 180,
which corresponds to a convective Reynolds number Rec = 3300 (based on channel half width and axial
velocity). To allow a reasonable time step within the restrictions of the acoustic CFL condition, the
mean centerline Mach number M = 0.2 has been chosen in the low subsonic domain. The trace of the
sub-grid scale stress tensor can be rewritten as τkk = γM 2
SGSp. For the small Mach number considered
in the present simulations, the sub-grid Mach number MSGS is expected to be small. Consequently
we simply neglect τkk. Also, SGS ﬂuxes in the total energy equation were treated using a ﬁxed (non-
dynamic) value Prt = 0.6. Because of the low Mach number, the linkage to the momentum ﬁeld was
totally negligible. The simulation parameters have been ﬁxed to allow quantitative comparisons with the
direct numerical simulation data of Kim et al. (1987). Two LES runs with the dynamical Smagorinsky
model are performed: one with the classical ﬁltering procedure and the other with the Taylor series,
derivative-based method.

x ≈ 66 and ∆+

For both LES cases the computational grid contains 17 × 61 × 16 points in the x, y, z directions
(or x1, x2, x3). The grid is uniform in the streamwise and spanwise directions and the corresponding
resolution was ∆+
z ≈ 10. Following Gamet (1999), we use a non-uniform mesh in
the wall normal direction based on the distribution: yi = Ly
C ) and
−1 ≤ ηi = 2 i−1
− 1 ≤ +1. The constant C is such that ∆+
y ≈ 10 near
Ny
the centerline. For comparison, minimal channel DNS was performed using Nx = 34, Ny = 121 and
Nz = 32. LES are started from ﬁltering a fully turbulent DNS ﬁeld. The statistics were accumulated
over time tuτ /δ = 5.4.

2 tanh(Kηi) with K = atanh( 1
y ≈ 2 at the wall and ∆+

As usual in channel ﬂow simulation with the dynamic procedure, we apply the test ﬁlter operation
only in the streamwise and spanwise directions. Because of the non uniform mesh in the cross direction,
we choose to use for the test ﬁlter width: ∆ = α (∆x∆z)1/2, with α = 2. For the LES of the ﬁlter-based
reference case we apply a box ﬁlter, using a trapezoidal rule for the integration of the convolution
operation. For the derivative-based method, the second order approximation (T = 2, D = 2) has been
chosen based on the results presented in section 3.2. Here the equivalence at second order between the
s)2 is given in (18), with
Gaussian and box ﬁlters mentioned in §2 is used. The ﬁnal expression for (ct
planar Laplacians (k = 1, 3 and m = 1, 3) and planar averaging, as discussed in § 2.

4.2.1. A priori results based on initial condition for LES

As a ﬁrst step we perform a priori tests at the initial time of the LES simulations, which are ﬁltered DNS
ﬁelds. Scatter plots comparing the L11, L12, M11, M12 components obtained by the Taylor series and
ﬁltering based methods, in the x-z plane at y+ = 43, are shown in Figure 6. The agreement between
real ﬁltered and estimated local values is fair. The general trends are reproduced with correlation
coeﬃcients of order 0.7. Speciﬁcally ρ(Lt
11) = 0.74, and
ρ(M t
12) = 0.64. Even if the local behavior of the typical components of Lij and Mij is not highly
accurate, the global behavior of these components is estimated reasonably well, as demonstrated by
Figure 7, showing the same tensor elements averaged in the x-z planes, as a function of wall normal
direction. We notice that despite an overestimation of the magnitude of each component, their general
shape is correctly predicted by the derivative-based approximation.

Figure 8 shows the instantaneous Smagorinsky coeﬃcients obtained by the classical ﬁltering procedure
and by the present derivative-based method. The a priori test shows that the Smagorinsky coeﬃcient
obtained by the Taylor series expansion approach is slightly smaller than the classical ﬁlter-based results.
However, the agreement is suﬃciently good in the context of a practical scheme, especially the reduction
to zero in the well-resolved near-wall region. As we will see in the next section, a posteriori tests give
improved results.

4.2.2. A posteriori results of LES

All the results presented in this section are time-averaged over 55 realizations spaced by a time interval
of 0.1δ/uτ . In Figure 9(a), we observe that the Smagorinsky coeﬃcient is very well predicted by the
derivative-based method, except some deviation near the centerline. As shown in Figure 9(b) the
derivative-based approach yields the expected y+3 behavior in the vicinity of the wall.

In Figure 10, we observe a fairly good agreement in streamwise mean velocity U between the results
of the Taylor series expansion method and both the results of the classical ﬁlter-based dynamic model
and the DNS results. Despite a slight underestimation in the buﬀer region, the proposed approach leads
to quite accurate results.

In Figure 11 are shown the rms intensities of the large-scale (resolved) turbulent velocity ﬂuctuations.
These rms quantities are compared with the rms velocities from the DNS ﬁltered at scale ∆ using a box
ﬁlter. The agreement between both LES results and the ﬁltered DNS data is quite good. For the derivative
based method, the streamwise rms velocity is slightly overestimated by both LES approaches. The wall-
normal and transverse rms velocities are underestimated slightly more by the derivative-based method
than the ﬁlter-based method. In Figure 11(d), we compare the Reynolds shear stress of the resolved
v′i. The proposed approach yields very good agreement with the ﬁlter-based dynamic model
velocity, h
and the reference ﬁltered DNS data.

5. Conclusions

An implementation of the dynamic Smagorinsky model that uses Taylor series expansions to avoid
explicit test-ﬁlter operations in LES has been developed. The proposed method has been subjected to a
priori and a posteriori tests. These tests were performed using structured grids, to check the performance
of the method in idealized, well controlled reference cases.

The a priori results obtained by truncating the Taylor series at 2nd order and at 4th order have been
compared with results obtained by test ﬁltering. It was found that for LES of isotropic turbulence, it is
s accurate to ∼ 5 % by using the 2nd order approximation. However, results
possible to obtain values of c2
are not improved by using the 4th order approximation because of the errors associated with evaluating
high-order derivatives on inherently rough LES ﬁelds. From these a priori tests, it is concluded that
the derivative based method should be implemented using the 2nd order approximations, with α = 2.
A posteriori tests of forced isotropic turbulence show that the derivative-based method yields stable
results, and values of c2

s to within ∼ 10% of those obtained by explicit test ﬁltering.
Applications to a minimal channel conﬁguration show that the observed diﬀerences between the
tensor elements in the ﬁlter-based and Taylor series based approaches are larger than those in isotropic
turbulence. This could be due to the strong anisotropy of the test ﬁlter as well as of the turbulence
itself. However the Smagorinsky coeﬃcient is correctly estimated by the proposed approach, especially
the y+3 behavior in the vicinity of the wall. Moreover ﬁrst and second order statistics, which are the
most important ones for practical engineering calculations, are correctly predicted when using the
derivative-based dynamic model.

Strictly speaking, these conclusions are applicable only to the fairly simple ﬂow conﬁgurations
considered in this work. However, the results suggest that applications of the Taylor series based dynamic
model to complex-geometry ﬂows on unstructured grids is a promising direction. Taken together with
the results of Jansen (1999) on the alternative generalized box-ﬁlter approach, the present results show
that applications of the dynamic model to LES of complex-geometry turbulent ﬂows are feasible.

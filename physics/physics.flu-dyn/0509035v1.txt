(Dated: February 20, 2014)

Various experiments have found a boundary slip in hydrophobic microchannel ﬂows, but a con-
sistent understanding of the results is still lacking. While Molecular Dynamics simulations are not
able to reach the low shear rates and large system sizes of the experiments, it is often not possi-
ble to resolve the needed details with macroscopic approaches. We model the interaction between
hydrophobic channel walls and the ﬂuid by means of a multi-phase lattice Boltzmann model. Our
mesoscopic approach is able to reach the small ﬂow velocities of known experiments and reproduces
results from experiments and other computer simulations, namely an increase of the slip with in-
creasing liquid-solid interactions, the slip being independent of the ﬂow velocity, and a decreasing
slip with increasing bulk pressure. Within our model we develop a semi-analytic approximation of
the dependence of the slip on the bulk pressure.

During the last century it was widely assumed that
the velocity of a Newtonian liquid at a surface is al-
ways identical to the velocity of the surface. However,
in recent years very well controlled experiments have
shown a violation of the no-slip boundary condition in
sub-micron sized geometries. Since then, experimental
[1] and theoretical works [2], as well as computer simula-
tions [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] have been performed to improve our
understanding of boundary slip. The complex behavior
of a ﬂuid close to a solid interface involves the interplay
of many physical and chemical properties. These include
the wettability of the solid, the shear rate, the pressure,
the surface charge, the surface roughness, as well as impu-
rities and dissolved gas. Since all those quantities have to
be determined very precisely, it is not surprising that our
understanding of the phenomenon is still very unsatisfac-
tory. Due to the large number of diﬀerent parameters, a
signiﬁcant dispersion of the results can be observed for
ostensibly similar systems [1]. For example, observed slip
lengths vary between a few nanometres [9] and microm-
eters [10] and while some authors ﬁnd a dependence of
the slip on the ﬂow velocity [11], others do not [10, 12].
Most recent computer simulations apply Molecular Dy-
namics (MD) and report increasing slip with decreasing
liquid density [6, 7] or liquid-solid interactions [8, 13],
while slip decreases with increasing pressure [4]. These
simulations are usually limited to some tens of thousands
of particles, lengths scales of nanometres and timescales
of nanoseconds. Also, shear rates are usually orders of
magnitude higher than in any experiment [1].

We use the lattice Boltzmann (LB) algorithm – a
powerful method for simulating ﬂuid dynamics [14].
Rather than tracking the state of individual atoms and
molecules, the dynamics of the single-particle distribu-
tion function η of mesoscopic ﬂuid packets is described.
In contrast to MD simulations, this method is much less
computationally demanding and allows us to simulate
experimentally accessible length and time scales. Our

ansatz diﬀers from other LB approaches where boundary
slip is introduced by generalizing the no-slip bounce back
boundary conditions in order to allow specular reﬂections
with a given probability [3] or where the ﬂuid viscosity
is not kept constant, but modiﬁed due to local density
variations in order to model slip [15]. In both cases, the
parameters determining the properties at the boundaries
are not easily mappable to experimentally available val-
ues. Our approach is based on Shan and Chen’s multi-
[16]. Here, interactions between diﬀer-
phase LB model
ent species are modelled by a mesoscopic force between
the phases. This naturally opens the way to introduce
a similar interaction between each ﬂuid species and the
channel walls, where the strength of the interaction is de-
termined by the ﬂuid densities, free coupling constants,
and a wall interaction parameter which is treated in a
similar manner as a local ﬂuid density. The model allows
the simulation of multi-phase ﬂows along hydrophobic
boundaries and is introduced in the following paragraphs.
However, in order to study the inﬂuence of hydrophobic-
ity on the boundary slip and to demonstrate the basic
properties of the model, we focus on single phase ﬂuid
ﬂow in this paper. The results of multi-phase simula-
tions will be presented in a future work. A multi-phase
LB system can be represented by a set of equations [17]

to 1 in our case [16]. g ¯αα is a force coupling constant,
whose magnitude controls the strength of the interaction
between component α and ¯α. The dynamical eﬀect of the
force is realized in the BGK collision operator in Eq. (2)
by adding to the velocity u in the equilibrium distribu-
tion an increment δuα = τ αFα/ηα. For the interaction
of the ﬂuid components with the channel walls we apply-
bounce back boundary conditionsand assign interaction
properties to the wall which are similar to those of an
additional ﬂuid species. I.e., we specify constant values
for the force coupling constant g ¯αα = gwall,α and the
density ηα = ηwall at wall boundary nodes of the lat-
tice. This results in a force as given in Eq. 3 between
the ﬂow and the boundaries which can be linked to a
contact angle between ﬂuid droplets and solid walls.The
contact angle is often used to quantitatively describe hy-
drophobic interactions [19].We simulate pressure driven
ﬂow between two inﬁnite planes (Poiseuille ﬂow), where
pressure driven boundary conditions are implemented in
a similar way as in most experiments: a ﬁxed pressure
is set at the channel inlet and an open boundary at the
outlet. Already in 1823, Navier proposed a boundary
condition where the ﬂuid velocity at a surface is propor-
tional to the shear rate at the surface [20]. Following his
hypothesis the velocity in ﬂow direction (vz) at position
x between the planes is given by

vz(x) =

(4)

where 2h is the distance between the planes, and µ the
viscosity. In contrast to a no-slip formulation, the last
term in Eq. 4 linearly depends on the slip length β. Since
β is typically of the order of nanometers or micrometers,
it can be neglected in macroscopic experiments. In order
to obtain β from our data, we measure the pressure gra-
dient ∂P /∂z at the center of the channel and the velocity
proﬁle between the two planes at a ﬁxed position z. β is
then obtained by a least square ﬁt with Eq. 4.

Our simulation parameters are as follows: the lattice
size is kept constant with the channel length (z direction)
being 256 sites, the distance between the plates 2h being
60 sites (x direction). We approximate inﬁnite planes by

y direction. In order to assure a fully equilibrated system
we simulate for at least 40000 time steps before measur-
ing. Each data point in the ﬁgures below corresponds to
about six hours simulation time on eight IBM Power 4
1.7GHz CPUs. All units in this paper are in lattice units
if not stated otherwise.

The dependence of the slip length β on the interac-
tion parameter gwall,α is studied for ηwall=1.0 and 5.0.
The bulk pressure P = ρc2
s, where ρ is the ﬂuid density
and cs = 1/√3 the speed of sound, is kept at P =0.11,
while the ﬂow velocity is set to V =0.033. As shown in
Fig. 1a we vary gwall,α from 0.06 to 0.22 and ﬁnd a steady
increase of β for increasing gwall,α. As expected, the
curve for ηwall=5.0 is growing substantially faster than
for ηwall=1.0. The maximum available β are at about 5.2
for gwall,α=0.26 and ηwall=1.0. At these strong ﬂuid-
wall interactions, the force as given in Eq. 3 becomes
very large and results in a large area of low ﬂuid density
close to the wall. Increasing the interaction even further
results in numerical instabilities. In order to study the
dependence of the slip on other parameters, the coupling
constant gwall,α is kept constant at 0.08 from now on.

Fig.1b depicts the dependence of β on ηwall for diﬀer-
ent bulk pressures P =0.033, 0.1, and 0.3 and ﬁxed ﬂow
10−3 in the system. While all three
velocity V = 3.5
graphs grow constantly with increasing ηwall, the one for
P =0.033 grows the fastest demonstrating that the abso-
lute values of the slip are higher for lower pressure.

With increasing wall interactions, we achieve an increase

are not able to ﬁnd any velocity dependence of β, but
ﬁnd constant slip for ﬁxed ﬂuid-wall interactions, which
is consistent with many experiments [12, 21]. The ﬂuctu-
ations of the data for very low ﬂow velocities are due to
numerical uncertainties of the ﬁt at very low curvature
of the parabolic velocity proﬁle. For V > 0.01 we ﬁnd
a slight deviation of β from the constant measurements.
This is due to a small variation of the bulk pressure from
10−4 to P =0.106 for V = 0.03 that
P =0.097 for V = 1
cannot easily be avoided for technical reasons. We have
checked for a few data points that β stays constant if
P can be kept at exactly foxed values, too. The slip
length being independent of the ﬂow velocity is consis-
tent with many experiments and computer simulations,
like the MD simulations of Cottin-Bizonne et al.
[22]
and the experiments of Cheng et al. [12] and Baudry et
al. [23]. We speculate that an increase of β with increas-
ing ﬂow velocity as measured by some experiments [11]
is due to surface roughness of the channel boundaries or
other nonlinear eﬀects. Since our model is not able to
treat roughness on an atomic scale, we do not expect to
conform with those results.

·

A common approach to model boundary slip is the two-
layer model where it is assumed that a thin ﬂuid layer
with thickness δ and diﬀerent viscosity as the bulk ﬂuid
exists near the channel walls. As calculated by various
[2], within this model the slip length can be

at the ﬁrst lattice site next to the wall. Fig. 3 shows the
dependence of ρ1 on gwall,α for ηwall=1.0, 5.0, P =0.11,
and V =0.033. An exact analytical function for ρ1 cannot
easily be given because the interaction as given in Eq. 3
results in a modiﬁcation of the equilibrium distribution
in the BGK collision operator. Therefore, we postulate
an interaction term that depends on the bulk density and
the ﬂuid-wall interaction as well as a free ﬁt parameter

are able to utilize this equation to ﬁt ρ1 for all our sim-
ulation parameters. k is found to be 8.35 for our data.
The lines in Fig. 3 illustrate the good quality of our ap-
proximation. A similar approach is applied to model the

(symbols) and the approximation (lines) for wall interac-
tions ηwall=0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The bulk pressure is varied
from 0.03 to 0.33. We ﬁnd a decrease of β with increasing
pressure P . An increase of ηwall leads to an increasing
slope of the curves and to higher absolute values for β.
Furthermore, we ﬁnd a decrease of the slip with increas-
ing bulk pressure. These results qualitatively agree with
MD simulations [4, 8]. Even with a single value for the
ﬁt parameter k, the semi-analytic description of β agrees
very well for low ﬂuid-wall interactions. For strong inter-
actions (ηwall=2.0), the ﬁt qualitatively reproduces the
behavior of the slip length. Higher order terms in the ex-

In conclusion, we have presented a new approach to
investigate boundary slip in hydrophobic microchannels
by means of a multi-phase LB model. In contrast to MD
simulations, our model is able to reach the length and
time scales of typical experiments and is applicable for a
wide range of realistic ﬂow velocities. We have qualita-
tively reproduced the dependence of the boundary slip on
the hydrophobicity of the channel walls and have found
constant slip for varying ﬂow velocities. The decrease of
the slip with increasing pressure can be approximated by
a semi-analytic approach. Our results are consistent with
MD simulations [4, 8, 22] and experiments [10].

We onsider the magnetorotational instability (MRI) of a hydrodynamially stable Taylor-Couette

(cid:29)ow with a helial external magneti (cid:28)eld in the indutionless approximation de(cid:28)ned by a zero

magneti Prandtl number (Pm = 0). This leads to a onsiderable simpli(cid:28)ation of the problem

eventually ontaining only hydrodynami variables. First, we point out that the energy of any

perturbation growing in the presene of magneti (cid:28)eld has to grow faster without the (cid:28)eld. This is

a paradox beause the base (cid:29)ow is stable without the magneti while it is unstable in the presene

of a helial magneti (cid:28)eld without being modi(cid:28)ed by the latter as it has been found reently by

Hollerbah and Rüdiger [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 124501 (2005)℄. We revisit this problem by using a

Chebyshev olloation method to alulate the eigenvalue spetrum of the linearized problem. In

this way, we on(cid:28)rm that MRI with helial magneti (cid:28)eld indeed works in the indutionless limit

where the destabilization e(cid:27)et appears as an e(cid:27)etive shift of the Rayleigh line. Seond, we integrate

the linearized equations in time to study the transient behavior of small amplitude perturbations,

thus showing that the energy arguments are orret as well. However, there is no real ontradition

between both fats. The linear stability theory predits the asymptoti development of an arbitrary

small-amplitude perturbation, while the energy stability theory yields the instant growth rate of

any partiular perturbation, but it does not aount for the evolution of this perturbation. Thus,

although swithing o(cid:27) the magneti (cid:28)eld instantly inreases the energy growth rate, in the same

time the ritial perturbation eases to be an eigenmode without the magneti (cid:28)eld. Consequently,

this perturbation is transformed with time and so looses its ability to extrat energy from the base

(cid:29)ow neessary for the growth.

The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is thought to

ently by Hollerbah and Rüdiger [6℄ that MRI an take

be responsible for the fast formation of stars and entire

when the

plae in the Taylor-Couette (cid:29)ow at Re ∼ 103

galaxies in aretion disks. For a star to form, the matter

imposed magneti (cid:28)eld is helial. The most surprising

rotating around it has to slow down by transferring its

fat is that this type of MRI persists even in the indu-

angular momentum outwards. Without MRI this pro-

ess would take muh longer than observed beause the

veloity distribution in the aretion disks seems to be

tionless limit of Pm = 0 where the ritial Reynolds num-
ber of the onventional MRI diverges as ∼ 1/Pm. This
limit of Pm = 0 formally orresponds to a poorly on-

hydrodynamially stable while the visosity alone is not

duting medium where the indued urrents are so weak

su(cid:30)ient to aount for the atual aretion rates.

It

that their magneti (cid:28)eld is negligible with respet to the

was suggested by Balbus and Hawley [1℄ that a Kep-

imposed (cid:28)eld. Thus, on one hand, the imposed magneti

lerian veloity distribution in an aretion disk an be

(cid:28)eld does not a(cid:27)et the base (cid:29)ow, whih is the only soure

destabilized by a magneti (cid:28)eld analogously to a hy-

of energy for the perturbation growth. But on the other

drodynamially stable ylindrial Taylor-Couette (cid:29)ow as

hand, perturbations are sub jet to additional damping

it was originally found by Velikhov [2℄ and later anal-

due to the Ohmi dissipation aused by the indued ur-

ysed in more detail by Chandrasekhar [3℄. In this ase,

rents.

the e(cid:27)et of (cid:16)frowziness(cid:17) of the axial magneti (cid:28)eld in a

We show rigorously that the imposed magneti (cid:28)eld

well onduting (cid:29)uid provides an additional oupling be-

indeed redues the energy growth rate of any partiular

tween the meridional and azimuthal (cid:29)ow perturbations

that, however, requires a magneti Reynolds number of

Rm ∼ 10. For a liquid metal with the magneti Prandtl
number Pm ∼ 10−5 − 10−6
dynami Reynolds number Re = Rm/Pm ∼ 106 − 107

this orresponds to a hydro-

[4, 5℄. Thus, this instability is hardly observable in the

laboratory beause any oneivable (cid:29)ow at suh Reynolds

perturbation. On one hand, this implies that the energy

of any perturbation, whih is growing in the presene

of magneti (cid:28)eld, has to grow even faster without the

(cid:28)eld and vie versa. But on the other hand, the (cid:29)ow

whih is found to be unstable in the presene of magneti

(cid:28)eld is ertainly known to be stable without the (cid:28)eld.

This apparent ontradition onstitutes the paradox of

number would be turbulent. However, it was shown re-

the indutionless MRI whih we address in this study.

Equations (3, 4) straightforwardly lead to the kineti

energy variation rate of a virtual perturbation v1 satis-

fying the inompressiblity onstraint and the boundary

integrating over the volume V whih extends axially over

the perturbation wavelength, we obtain

mann numbers Ha for both insulating and perfetly on-

duing ylinders. The ritial Re tends to in(cid:28)nity as µ
approahes µmax as in the nonmagneti Taylor-Couette

instability. Thus, in the indutionless approximation, the

a shift of the Rayleigh line towards higher µ. The shift is

The results of time-integration of the linearized prob-

k = 2 at Re = 2000. This perturbation is unstable in the

trary, su(cid:30)iently small initial perturbation for a su(cid:30)-

trast, the seond term is negative de(cid:28)nite presenting an

iently long time so that the unstable mode dominates

but still remains small for the linear approximation to be

Ha = 0. Note that we assume the (cid:28)eld to be instantly

neti (cid:28)eld, we onlude that the instant growth rate of

To understand the physial mehanism of this instabil-

ity, note that a helial magneti (cid:28)eld, in ontrast to pure

axial or azimuthal (cid:28)elds, provides an additional oupling

between meridional and azimuthal (cid:29)ow perturbations. In

a helial magneti (cid:28)eld with axial and azimuthal ompo-

nents, the radial omponent of the meridional (cid:29)ow per-

turbation indues azimuthal and axial urrent ompo-

nents, respetively. Interation of this urrent with the

imposed magneti (cid:28)eld results in a purely radial eletro-

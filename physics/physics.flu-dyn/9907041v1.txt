Abstrat

The skin of Tursiops Trunatus is orrugated with small, quasi-periodi ridges running

irumferentially about the torso. These ridges extend into the turbulent boundary

layer and a(cid:27)et the evolution of oherent strutures. The development and evolution

of oherent strutures over a surfae is desribed by the formation and dynamis of

vortex (cid:28)laments. The dynamis of these (cid:28)laments over a (cid:29)at, non-ridged surfae is

determined analytially, as well as through numerial simulation, and found to agree

with the observations of oherent strutures in the turbulent boundary layer. The

alulation of the linearized dynamis of the vortex (cid:28)lament, suessful for the dy-

namis of a (cid:28)lament over a (cid:29)at surfae, is extended and applied to a vortex (cid:28)lament

propagating over a periodially ridged surfae. The surfae ridges indue a rapid para-

metri foring of the vortex (cid:28)lament, and alter the (cid:28)lament dynamis signi(cid:28)antly. A

onsideration of the ontribution of vortex (cid:28)lament indued (cid:29)ow to energy transport

indiates that the behavior of the (cid:28)lament indued by the ridges an diretly redue

surfae drag by up to 8%. The size, shape, and distribution of utaneous ridges for

Tursiops Trunatus is found to be optimally on(cid:28)gured to a(cid:27)et the (cid:28)lament dynam-

is and redue surfae drag for swimming veloities onsistent with observation.

Introdution

1.1 Dolphins

A dolphin gliding through water with grae and speed presents both a beautiful per-

formane of nature and a persistent enigma to (cid:29)uid dynamiists. Traditional models of

(cid:29)uid (cid:29)ow applied to a swimming dolphin suggest this mammal is apable of aberrantly

large powers of musular exertion. However, studies of dolphin energy expenditure

show that a dolphin has a metabolism similar to that of other mammals [1℄, implying

that these animals, rather then having unusual musular apability, may posses some

mehanism that allows them to slip through water with unusually little e(cid:27)ort. Sir

John Gray was the (cid:28)rst to hypothesize that dolphins may posses an ability to impede

the development of turbulene over the skin surfae and hene redue the surfae

drag of a swimming dolphin [2℄. A method of reduing boundary layer turbulene

and surfae drag would be extremely useful if it ould be implemented e(cid:30)iently, and

the atualization of suh a method has posed a theoretial and experimental hallenge

to researhers.

1.1.1 Skin pliability and ative ontrol response

Some researhers have attempted to reprodue the dolphin's onjetured drag redu-

tion by studying (cid:21) and attempting to dupliate (cid:21) the pliable nature of dolphin skin [3℄.

It was thought that the surfae drag indued by a turbulent boundary layer ould be

redued if the surfae was able to yield to the mirosopi disturbanes produed by

turbulent eddies. Unfortunately, this approah was not signi(cid:28)antly suessful. More

reently, a large e(cid:27)ort has been extended towards exploring the possibility that ative

ontrol of surfae shape in response to the fores from the turbulent boundary layer

may be able to redue turbulent development. The proposal that this sort of diret

ative response is implemented by dolphins is ostensibly supported by the existene

7

over the body of a dolphin (From Shoemaker and Ridgway [4℄).

of systems of nerves and utaneous musle that appear apable of atively ontrol-

ling the skin surfae. However, detailed measurement of dolphins' skin reation to

mirovibratory stimuli indiate a minimum response time on the order of 10−2s [4℄,

whereas the timesale assoiated with the passage of oherent strutures over the skin

is on the order of 10−4s [8℄. This indiates that a dolphin's skin is not able to respond

to the passage of individual oherent strutures.

1.1.2 Cutaneous ridges

It is only reently that Shoemaker and Ridgway doumented a feature of odontoete

skin that had been virtually unknown previous to their work; namely, the existene

of utaneous ridges overing most of the body surfae [5℄. These orrugations, with

furrows running irumferentially around the whales, are reported to be h
60µm in height when the animal is at rest, with a separation of L

0.4

−

and vary slightly in sale over the dolphin's body. The ridges are absent from the

dolphin's snout and from muh of the head (cid:21) regions assoiated with laminar (cid:29)ow,

as well as from the (cid:29)ippers and tail, (Figure 1.1). The fat that the orrugations

exist only in regions of steady turbulent (cid:29)ow is a strong indiation that these ridges

are assoiated with turbulent development. The absene of the orrugations from the

(cid:29)ippers and tail indiates that the ridges may not be useful in these regions whih

are exposed to large veloity and pressure variations.

Mirosopi studies of setions of skin over the dolphin's body show the apillary

and musular struture to be orrelated with utaneous ridge spaing. This anatom-

ial analysis is onsistent with the possibility that a dolphin may atively tune the

neous musle, while the (cid:16)relaxed(cid:17) ridge height ratio, indiative of the available range

of ridge heights, is muh larger. This hypothesis is further supported by reports from

trainers at Sea World that the surfae ridges beome more pronouned with greater

swimming speed [5℄.

The existene of regular orrugations with tunable amplitude overing the bodies

of these e(cid:30)ient swimmers, in regions assoiated with steady turbulent boundary layer

(cid:29)ow, presents a hallenging new mystery. This hallenge is met in this dissertation,

whih presents a theoretial model for and an analysis of the e(cid:27)et of suh a wavy

boundary on turbulent development.

1.1.3 Fluid (cid:29)ow development over dolphin skin

Allthough utaneous ridges were observed and measured by Shoemaker and Ridgway

in seven speies of toothed whales (odontoetes), ranging in body length from two to

eight meters [5℄, no orrelation between body size and orrugation sale is visible in

the data. It may be possible, through future study, to establish a orrelation between

orrugation sale and swimming speed. However, detailed information regarding the

swimming speeds of these various speies is not urrently available. Hene, a or-

9

relation between swimming speed and orrugation size is not presently possible to

establish. The best observational data urrently exists for the bottlenosed dolphin

(Tursiops Trunatus ), and this speies is taken as representative for this analysis.

Adult Tursiops vary in size from two to four meters, mass approximately 200kg ,

and have been observed to be apable of bursts of swimming speed up to 50 km
onstant ruising speed is reported to be roughly U

10 km

Thus, a laterally (cid:29)at dolphin may be assumed for the purpose of studying boundary

layer turbulene. The transition to turbulene ours for (cid:29)ow over a (cid:29)at plate at a

is signi(cid:28)antly delayed by the pressure gradient indued by the longitudinal urva-

ture of the dolphin's head, and is observed via bioluminesent exitation to begin

approximately 40cm from the snout [7℄.

Allthough transition to turbulene in (cid:29)ow over a dolphin's urved head is delayed

by the favorable pressure gradient, one initiated, turbulent development and evolu-

tion is assumed to be of the same harater as turbulent development over a (cid:29)at plate

with no pressure gradient.

The boundary layer

A onsideration of the e(cid:27)et of surfae orrugations on turbulent (cid:29)ow development

(cid:28)rst enounters the leading edge of the (cid:29)at plate. The (cid:29)uid at the plate surfae

is attahed to the surfae via moleular interations and must satisfy the (cid:16)no slip(cid:17)

The boundary layer (cid:29)uid indues a shear stress of

on the wall in the

x diretion. This stress produes the drag fore per unit area on a

body traveling through the (cid:29)uid. The shear stress at the surfae provides a natural

sale for veloities and distanes near the wall for both laminar and turbulent (cid:29)ow.

2.2 The boundary layer TS instability

The linear stability analysis of laminar boundary layer (cid:29)ow over a (cid:29)at plate was (cid:28)rst

alulated by Tollmien in 1929, Shlihting in 1933, and on(cid:28)rmed experimentally by

Shubauer and Skramstadt in 1947. The stability analysis proeeds by onsidering

an in(cid:28)nitesimal, z independent perturbation, −→u1 , to the laminar veloity (cid:28)eld, −→u0 , of

the form

−→u = −→u0 + −→u1(y)ei(kx−ωt)
and solving the resulting eigenvalue problem for the wavenumber, k , frequeny, ω ,
and perturbing pro(cid:28)le, −→u1(y). For a laminar veloity pro(cid:28)le, −→u0 , determined from a
solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, the imaginary omponent of ω (cid:28)rst beomes
positive when the boundary layer has grown to the thikness δc

420 ν

U , implying

the onset of instability. The frequeny and wavelength of the unstable TS waves at

this onset of instability are found to be ℜ

≃

(ωc)

.15 U
∗ and λc
δc

17δc

∗ . The TS

waves grow very rapidly beyond the transition point, and the boundary layer takes on

∗ ≃
x = 2π

kc ≃

a qualitatively di(cid:27)erent form. The new (cid:29)ow, now with large sale periodi variations

in x, beomes unstable to a three-dimensional instability with periodi variations in
z . The three-dimensional instability, best understood through a study of vortiity

dynamis, evolves diretly to turbulent (cid:29)ow.

2.3 The evolution of boundary layer vortiity

The evolution of the boundary layer may be more deeply understood via a desription

of the dynamis of vortiity. The vortiity (cid:28)eld of the (cid:29)uid is de(cid:28)ned as the url of

the veloity,

−→ω = −→

∇ × −→u

Taking the url of the Navier-Stokes equation, (2.1), and using a vetor identity

produes the vortiity equation for the inompressible (cid:29)uid,

dt−→ω = ∂t−→ω +

The laminar (cid:29)uid (cid:29)ow over the (cid:29)at plate is desribed simply as the reation of on-

entrated vortiity at the leading edge and its di(cid:27)usion, advetion, and strething

downstream.

2.3.1 Formation of vortex (cid:28)laments

The adveted vortiity initially oats the (cid:29)at plate with a smooth layer of vortiity.

The entire laminar boundary layer may be onsidered a vortex sheet of onstant

14

strength, with sheet thikness inreasing with x. From this point of view, the TS

instability of the boundary layer is seen as similar to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability

of a shear layer.

With the onset of the TS instability, the smooth vortiity of the sheet ondenses

into areas of higher vortiity separated periodially in x. These onentrations of

vortiity then ontinue via nonlinear evolution to wrap and ondense into spanwise

oriented vortex (cid:28)laments, evolution similar to the nonlinear development of a shear

layer [9℄. This proess of nonlinear development into vortex (cid:28)laments is highly in(cid:29)u-

ened by small irregularities in the initial (cid:29)uid veloity (cid:28)eld whih produe signi(cid:28)ant

variations from perfetly uniform vortex (cid:28)laments. Although the shape and distri-

bution may deviate signi(cid:28)antly from the ideal, these (cid:28)laments and their evolution

represent the dominant struture of the boundary layer after the transition point, and

play the entral role in further boundary layer development.

2.3.2 Three-dimensional vortex (cid:28)lament instability

The initial vortex (cid:28)laments, evolving from the vortex sheet after the TS instability,

are separated by the distane λc

17δc

∗ in x, and are loated at the initial height y0

x ≃

above the surfae. A alulation of the three dimensional instability will show that

this height must be equal to y0 ≃

x ≫

6wu. Sine λc

y0 , the e(cid:27)et of initial neighboring

(cid:28)laments on evolution is small and may be ignored [10℄.

A straight vortex (cid:28)lament in the presene of a boundary is unstable due to the

veloity (cid:28)eld indued by its interation with the surfae. The (cid:28)lament veloity (cid:28)eld

is alulated by onsidering it to arise from an image vortex beneath the (cid:29)at surfae.

A plot of the image indued veloity (cid:28)eld surrounding the (cid:28)lament, relative to the

motion of the (cid:28)lament, (Figure 2.2), shows the nature and diretion of the strething

(cid:29)ow.

at an angle of approximately 45o

The (cid:28)lament is linearly unstable to deformations in this strething plane, oriented

to the boundary surfae. This three dimensional

vortex (cid:28)lament instability is treated in detail in Chapter 3, and the e(cid:27)ets of a wavy

boundary are onsidered in Chapter 4. The (cid:28)lament over a (cid:29)at boundary is found to

be maximally unstable to deformations of wavelength λc

17yo , and is skethed in

z ≃

rapidly deforms into a sinusoid of wavelength λc

z inlined at an angle of approximately

. The expanding sinusoidal (cid:28)lament then leaves the realm of linear evolution as

the bottom of the (cid:28)lament nears the surfae and adheres to it, forming streamwise

oriented vortex (cid:16)legs,(cid:17) while the top of the (cid:28)lament ontinues to rise with linear rather

then exponential growth as it advets downstream. In this manner a (cid:16)horseshoe(cid:17) or

(cid:16)hairpin(cid:17) vortex is formed. Although the existene of hairpin vorties was postulated

by Theodorsen in 1952 [18℄, and has been examined in great detail in experiments by

Head and Bandyopadhyay [17℄ and others [19℄, the vortex (cid:28)lament instability meha-

nism, the Crow instability [11℄, leading to the formation of these hairpin vorties, has

only now been established [10℄. The linear Crow instability of a vortex (cid:28)lament pair

was initially alulated, and on(cid:28)rmed numerially [12℄, for the ase of two airraft

trailing vorties. The same analysis applies for the near wall (cid:28)lament, and is desribed

in Chapter 3, with the seond of the vortex pair replaed by the image (cid:28)lament.

Reent experimental investigations indiate that autogeneration ours in the fur-

ther evolution of these vortex (cid:28)laments [13℄. In this proess, the legs of the hairpin

vortex pinh together and form another (cid:28)lament, whih then grows via the same in-

stability, to align itself slightly behind the original. This proess repeats and produes

a long hain of hairpin vorties in line behind eah original hairpin. These trains of

tightly paked hairpin vorties, (cid:16)hairpin pakets,(cid:17) are the dominant strutures in the

turbulent boundary layer.

2.4 The turbulent boundary layer

The fully turbulent boundary layer over a (cid:29)at plate is a tumultuous olletion of

hairpin vortex pakets and (cid:28)lament remnants. Sine boundary layer evolution is

highly nonlinear and sensitively dependent on initial onditions, any simple model,

suh as the one desribed with the idealized vortex (cid:28)lament piture, an only represent

17

the dominant proesses of the dynamis and annot apture the (cid:28)ne struture of small

sale motions. Rather, a statistial analysis of (cid:29)uid (cid:29)ow is employed to understand

the proesses of energy transport and indued surfae drag. The e(cid:27)ets of oherent

strutures, suh as olletions of hairpin vorties, may then be onsidered on the basis

of how they e(cid:27)et the mean properties of the (cid:29)ow.

2.4.1 Reynolds deomposition

The mean veloity (cid:28)eld in the turbulent boundary layer is found by taking the in(cid:28)nite

time average of the veloity (cid:28)eld

−→u = lim
t0→∞

1
t0 Z

t0

0 −→u dt

−→u = −→u + −→u′

The Reynolds deomposition is performed by deomposing the variables into the time

average quantity and the remaining (cid:29)utuating quantity, −→u′

,

This deomposition allows the steady, time independent, mean (cid:29)ow to be onsidered

separately from the more omplex underlying turbulent (cid:29)ow. The mean equations of

motion are obtained by taking the time average of the inompressibility ondition,

(2.2), and Navier-Stokes equation, (2.1), to get, in omponent notation,

The mean (cid:29)ow of the boundary layer develops a pro(cid:28)le similar to the laminar

(cid:29)ow pro(cid:28)le. A standard model of the mean veloity pro(cid:28)le for turbulent boundary

layer (cid:29)ow has emerged from many deades of experimental researh. The pro(cid:28)le,

ux , as a funtion of y , breaks into several regions. The (cid:16)inner region(cid:17) extends to
approximately 5wu, and is (cid:28)tted by the urve ux(y < 5wu)

Unlike the laminar (cid:29)ow ase, in whih the primary energy loss is due to visosity,

the mean (cid:29)ow of the turbulent boundary layer is in(cid:29)uened more strongly by the

energy loss to the underlying turbulent (cid:29)ow due to the Reynolds stress. In regions

far from the boundary the e(cid:27)ets of visosity on the mean equations of motion are

negligible, and the visosity term may be ignored.

of large mean shear. This may be understood physially as the reation of turbulent

(cid:29)ow by the lifting of low speed (cid:29)uid near the boundary layer up and against the

higher speed (cid:29)uid in the upper boundary layer, a (cid:16)low speed streak(cid:17) and (cid:16)turbulent

burst,(cid:17) and by the onverse, a (cid:16)sweep,(cid:17) in whih high speed (cid:29)uid desends into the

lower boundary layer [14℄. This intermittent turbulent bursting and sweeping phe-

nomenon is experimentally observed in the turbulent boundary layer, and measured

to aount for the ma jority, 60

80% [15℄[16℄, of the turbulent energy transfer. These

phenomenon are onsistent with the hairpin vortex model of turbulent strutures,

and the large energy transfer may be onsidered as (cid:29)owing from the mean shear into

the strething of the inlined hairpin vortex (cid:28)laments in the boundary layer.

The energy imparted to the turbulent development of the (cid:29)uid, that is, the growth

of hairpin pakets, must ultimately arise from the surfae via surfae drag. The mean

surfae stress is τ0 = µ ∂ux
∂y

. The mean veloity pro(cid:28)le, ux(x, y), of turbulent

boundary layer (cid:29)ow is strongly a(cid:27)eted by the Reynolds stress. The addition of

the Reynolds stress term with u′
generates a muh steeper pro(cid:28)le than for laminar (cid:29)ow, ∂yux ≫

The veloity (cid:28)eld around an adveting hairpin vortex, or vortex paket, diretly

explains the observation of streaks, bursts, and sweeps. The streak and burst events

are desribed by the upwards and bakwards (cid:29)ow beneath the vortex (cid:28)lament heads,

while the sweep events are assoiated with the passing of the vortex legs near the

boundary. Furthermore, the well doumented spanwise spaing of the streaks, λ

A oherent model of turbulent motions over a (cid:29)at surfae is formed by the on-

ondense during the TS instability, and rapidly develop into hairpins, via the three

dimensional instability, to onstitute a turbulent boundary layer. Further spanwise

vorties ondense in the high shear region, y0 ≃

3.1 The vortex (cid:28)lament

Consider a single, nearly straight, in(cid:28)nite vortex (cid:28)lament, parallel to the ~z -axis,

loated in spae above the (cid:29)at surfae at the position

−→R (z, t) = (X (z, t) , Y (z, t) , z)

This time, t, and spanwise oordinate, z , dependent desription of the (cid:28)lament posi-

tion is adequate for the linear stability analysis in whih the (cid:28)lament is not allowed

to loop bak on itself in the z diretion.

The atual vortiity distribution is not singular, but is haraterized by a (cid:28)nite vortex

However, the above approximation is valid in the ase of small vortex ore sizes, and

the results of the stability alulation will display only a weak dependene on ore

size.

3.2 Equations of motion

The motion of the (cid:28)lament is obtained by using (3.3) in the vortiity equation, (2.5),

The equations for the three dimensional motion of the (cid:28)lament, (3.4), are presently ill

de(cid:28)ned beause the indued veloity, (3.10), diverges at the (cid:28)lament. This is remedied

by using a (cid:28)lament with a (cid:28)nite ore size. Rather then make a smoothing orretion

to the vortiity distribution, (3.3), with the assoiated ompliation of dealing with

ore dynamis [22℄[23℄, a uto(cid:27) is imposed on the self-indution term for the stream

The use of this approximate, non-singular Green funtion is superior to the uto(cid:27)

method for alulations. It is used in (3.14) to form the new, non-singular Hamilto-

nian.

The radius of the vortex ores, a, for the initial spanwise (cid:28)laments must be es-

tablished by diret experimental observation. An inspetion of slides of turbulent

boundary layer (cid:29)ow indiates ore sizes on the order of a
loated at an initial height of y0 ≃

≃

Although this quantity is only roughly estimated, the (cid:28)lament instability of inter-

est, the instability indued by the (cid:28)lament interation with the wall, is only weakly

dependent on ore size.

3.7 Linearization

The equations of motion may be linearized for small perturbations from the straight

(cid:28)lament solution. An analysis of the (cid:28)lament behavior for small perturbations will

display the nature of the three dimensional instability, inluding its angle and growth

as a funtion of spanwise wavelength. This linear analysis will later be on(cid:28)rmed and

extended by a fully nonlinear numerial simulation in Setion 3.10.

The equations of motion, (3.5), are linearized around the two dimensional (cid:28)lament

motion to get,

(3.15)

where ε is a bookkeeping variable used to keep trak of the order in the small per-

x and

turbative variables,

Hamiltonian formulation. The Hamiltonian, (3.14), for the (cid:28)lament over the (cid:29)at

3.8 Diagonalization

The linearized equations of motion, (3.19), along with the quadrati Hamiltonian,

(3.20), omprise a set of linear, integro-partial di(cid:27)erential equations for the dynamial

variables

y(z, t). This set of equations is redued to a set of linear, ordinary
di(cid:27)erential equations by applying a Fourier transform in z to obtain the new omplex

The next step is to show how the quadrati Hamiltonian, (3.20), is diagonalized

by this transformation, and alulate the resulting equations of motion. Sine the

Green funtion, (3.15), within the Hamiltonian is expliitly dependent only on z

the maximum instability ourring at ky0 ≃

For any small initial perturbation of the straight (cid:28)lament, the high wavenumber

modes rotate about the ore while the low wavenumber modes expand in the unstable

plane, θ+ , and ontrat in the stable plane, θ− . The maximally unstable mode, ky0 ≃
0.36, expands exponentially faster then the others, and rapidly beomes the dominant

deformation of the (cid:28)lament. The (cid:28)lament evolves into a sinusoidal shape inlined at

approximately 43o

, with a wavelength of λ = 2π

Although the linear analysis gives a preise desription of vortex (cid:28)lament motion for

small perturbations, the full equations of motion, (3.5), are highly nonlinear; and it

is expeted that nonlinear mehanisms will determine the dynamis after the initial

perturbations grow to signi(cid:28)ant size.

3.10 Numerial simulation and nonlinear evolution

Numerial simulation provides an e(cid:27)etive means of exploring nonlinear behavior,

as well as on(cid:28)rming linear analysis. The fully nonlinear equations of motion for a

vortex (cid:28)lament lend themselves readily to numerial analysis. However, the equation

for vortex position, (3.2), must be modi(cid:28)ed to a fully parametri representation to

allow for the possibility of the (cid:28)lament doubling bak in the

z diretion,

−→R (s, t) = (X(s, t), Y (s, t), Z(s, t))

b

in whih s is an arbitrary parameter along the (cid:28)lament. The equation of motion for

the (cid:28)lament is then simply

∂t−→R (s, t) = −→u

with the veloity (cid:28)eld given by the Bio-Savart integral, (3.10), with a (cid:28)nite ore size.

(cid:28)rming the auray of the linear analysis. The nonlinear e(cid:27)ets begin to ontribute

Although this numerial simulation gives a satisfatory desription of (cid:28)lament mo-

the details of (cid:28)lament autogeneration and multiple (cid:28)lament interation. A simulation

of autogeneration along these lines would require more detailed ore dynamis as well

as the use of vortex (cid:28)lament surgery. Alternatively, a three dimensional simulation

of the Eulerian vortiity (cid:28)eld of an autogenerating hairpin produes exellent results

[13℄. However, the present numerial model serves as a suessful on(cid:28)rmation of the

linear result, displaying the dominant evolution of θ+ ≃

3.11 Comparison with oherent strutures in the tur-

bulent boundary layer

The qualitative agreement between the analyti results and the reported experimen-

tal observations of hairpin vorties leaves little doubt that this (cid:28)lament instability is

responsible for the development of hairpin vorties in the turbulent boundary layer.

The observed 45o

inlination is given a solid mathematial foundation, and the nu-

merial simulation of the evolving (cid:28)lament, 3.3, produes a geometry that onforms

exellently with the reports of observers and oneptual models as reviewed by Robin-

son [19℄, and more reently eluidated by Zhong and others [24℄, and by Delo and

Smits [25℄.

The analyti alulation of the existene of the maximally unstable wavenumber,

ky0 ≃
.36, together with the experimental observation of spanwise wavelengths of
100wu for these strutures in the boundary layer, demands that the average initial
6wu. This is reasonably loated in a

measured loation of maximal turbulent energy prodution [26℄.

However, the true power of the newly established mathematial model for vortex

(cid:28)lament dynamis in the boundary layer lies in its potential for desribing and pre-

diting new phenomenon. In the next hapter the existant mathematial framework

will be extended to the ase of a orrugated boundary surfae, and new preditions

will be extrated regarding the subsequent dynamial behavior of the vortex (cid:28)lament.

Filament evolution over a wavy

Several deades of intense aademi study have provided an extensive

knowledge base of the simple anonial ase. The immediate need is to

learn to utilize this store of information in the ontext of boundary-layer

modeling and ontrol methodologies, with the eventual goal of pratial

appliation to engineering problems involving real-world, nonanonial

boundary layers. (cid:21) Stephen K. Robinson [19℄

In the last paragraph of his exellent review artile on oherent motions in the turbu-

lent boundary layer, Stephen K. Robinson urged researhers to build upon the foun-

dation of knowledge in vortex (cid:28)lament behavior and to forge ahead into the unharted

territory of ontrol methodologies. This hapter addresses one suh methodology: the

use of a stati, wavy boundary to ontrol vortex (cid:28)lament evolution.

The study of this ontrol methodology is motivated by the existene of suh sur-

fae orrugations on the bodies of dolphins, with the physial parameters of bak-

ground (cid:29)ow speed and surfae ridge geometry taken diretly from measurements of

these animals. A study of vortex (cid:28)lament dynamis above suh a boundary, using

the tools developed in Chapter 3, eluidates the e(cid:27)ets on turbulent boundary layer

development and the potential for drag redution.

A vortex (cid:28)lament propagating over a wavy surfae is sub jeted to rapid periodi

foring due to its interation with the surfae. The (cid:28)lament is near the surfae over

the ridge peaks and far from the surfae over the ridge troughs. Also, the unstable

manifold, shown in Figure 2.2, osillates in diretion and magnitude as the surfae

beneath the (cid:28)lament is inlined to the horizontal. This rapid parametri foring is

similar to the pondermotive foring of a harged partile in an eletromagneti wave,

and dynamially similar to the parametri foring of an inverted pendulum [27℄,[28℄.

37

The pondermotive foring has a dramati e(cid:27)et on the instability, as it does in the

ase of the pendulum.

4.1 The boundary and the vortex (cid:28)lament

The wavy boundary is taken to be an in(cid:28)nite surfae, −→B , beneath the (cid:28)lament,
uniform in the ~z diretion, and periodi in the

x diretion. Hene,

The utaneous ridges of Tursiops Trunatus, (Figure 1.2), are near sinusoidal,

with slightly steeper ridges then troughs. The ridges of a live dolphin at rest are

measured, 25cm behind the blowhole [5℄, to have an average height of h
and an average spaing of L

Although these initial values for the (cid:28)laments are alulated for a (cid:29)at plate, they will

be taken as the approximate values for (cid:28)laments evolving over a wavy boundary.

The (cid:28)lament position as a funtion of z and t is, for the ase of a wavy boundary,

still written as

4.2 Orthogonal urvilinear oordinates

The existene of a wavy boundary signi(cid:28)antly ompliates the alulation of the

indued veloity (cid:28)eld over the surfae. However, the problem is simpli(cid:28)ed by the

introdution of orthogonal urvilinear oordinates that math the boundary.

The oordinate lines of onstant u and v , mapped into the xy plane, are shown

in Figure 4.1. This oordinate transformation approximates the wavy boundary of

dolphin skin,

B (x(u, v))

|v=0 = y(u, v)

|v=0

with peaks slightly sharper then troughs.

Using the new oordinates, the bakground potential (cid:29)ow satisfying the free-slip

boundary onditions over the wavy surfae may be obtained from the simple vetor

potential, −→Ψb(u, v) = ubv

as well as the free-slip ondition,

surfae.

Although it is possible to ontinue to onsider the motion of the (cid:28)lament in arte-

sian oordinates above the wavy boundary, using the urvilinear oordinates only for

the purpose of veloity (cid:28)eld omputation, the analysis is greatly simpli(cid:28)ed by trans-

forming the dynamial variables of the (cid:28)lament, X and Y , into the new oordinate

system as well. This obviates the need to onvert bak and forth between urvilinear

and artesian oordinates.

4.3 Non-anonial transformation

A non-anonial transformation is made from the old dynamial (cid:28)lament variables,

X and Y , to the new variables, U(X, Y ) and V (X, Y ), via the inverse of the oordi-

Although the solution to (4.10) is simple for the ase of two dimensional motion,

beause the z dependene is integrated out, the full three dimensional solution is

4.4 Two dimensional motion

The goal of this analysis is to obtain a desription of the behavior of a vortex (cid:28)lament

over a wavy surfae. The dynamis of a straight (cid:28)lament must be determined, and

then extended via a small perturbation, to predit the (cid:28)lament behavior. The be-

havior of the straight (cid:28)lament is determined by onsidering the motion in the proper

urvilinear oordinates. A two dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, whih arises

as the limit of the full three dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, failitates this

analysis.

The (cid:28)lament travels along a streamline of onstant v0 , with u0(t) steadily inreas-
ing with period T in time, u0(nT +t) = nL+u0(t). The (cid:28)rst order, nonlinear ordinary
di(cid:27)erential equation for u0(t), (4.14), is integrated numerially to obtain the (cid:28)lament
position as a funtion of time. The straight (cid:28)lament, −−→RW
2 (t) = (u0 (t) , v0)uv , moving
along the streamlines of onstant v0 with varying veloity, (Figure 4.2), is used as the

basis for small three dimensional perturbations about this solution.

It is also possible to integrate the equations of motion, (4.14), analytially, rather

then numerially, to obtain an equation in losed form for the (cid:28)lament postion, u0 ,

4.5 Linearized equations of three dimensional (cid:28)la-

The Hamiltonian, (4.7), with the Poisson brakets, (4.5), generates the dynamis of

These equations of motion are linearized about the straight (cid:28)lament solution, as was

4.6 The approximate Green funtion

The alulation of the linear equations of motion for the vortex (cid:28)lament over the

wavy boundary, (4.19), requires the use of the Green funtion solution to the singular

Poisson equation, (4.10), satisfying the boundary onditions, (4.9). This Green fun-

tion may not be easily found in losed form beause of the non-trivial nature of the

position dependent Laplae operator in the wavy oordinates, (4.11). However, it is

possible to approximate this Green funtion, and to improve upon this approximation

by employing a Neumann series.

The approximate Green funtion is required to have the following properties: it

must redue to the (cid:29)at boundary Green funtion as

the orret two dimensional Green funtion, (4.12), and it must satisfy the boundary

onditions at the surfae, (4.9). The (cid:29)at boundary Green funtion, (3.15), with

h
L →

0, it must integrate to

urvilinear oordinates as arguments,

is apparent in the di(cid:27)erene of (4.27) from the equations of motion in the presene

of a (cid:29)at boundary, (3.25). The most important di(cid:27)erene is the appearane of time

dependent terms in the matrix oe(cid:30)ients, due to the periodi motion of the straight

vortex (cid:28)lament over the wavy surfae, u0(t). This a(cid:27)ets the (cid:28)lament primarily

through an overall time periodi amplitude strething,

s2(u0(t),v0) , due to the expansion

and ontration of the (cid:29)ow streamlines over the surfae. The perturbative mode

amplitudes,

u and

v , are also a(cid:27)eted independently by the hanges in the (cid:29)ow

veloity (cid:28)eld surrounding the propagating (cid:28)lament (cid:21) a result of the veloity (cid:28)eld,

and hene the uv frame, roking rapidly bak and forth as the enter of the (cid:28)lament

e

travels over the undulations.

Although the method of images is not aurate for a wavy surfae, it is a good

approximation when the (cid:28)lament height is small ompared to the period,

h
L ≪

1,

47

and provides an alternative view of the e(cid:27)ets of the wavy surfae on the (cid:28)lament

instability. As the (cid:28)lament enter travels over the surfae, following a streamline,

(Figure 4.2), it travels periodially loser to and farther from the boundary, with

its image (cid:28)lament drawing orrespondingly nearer and farther. This rapid, time

periodi, hange in the most fundamental parameter, the vortex (cid:28)lament height from

the surfae, has a signi(cid:28)ant e(cid:27)et on the evolution of the vortex (cid:28)lament perturbation

amplitudes.

4.8 Floquet analysis

The linear equations of motion, (4.27), governing the evolution of the vortex (cid:28)lament

perturbation for eah wavenumber, k , ontain oe(cid:30)ients that are periodi in time,
with period T . Floquet's theorem implies that the general solution to these equations

may be written as

It is not surprising that the Floquet exponents are inverses, sine the motion is due

to Hamiltonian (cid:29)ow and to oordinate frame rotation.

The stability of the (cid:28)lament is now ompletely desribed by the Floquet solution.

Sine the exponents are inverses, the perturbation has either neutral stability, with

σ1|and
(σ1) = 0, or a pair of unstable and stable modes, with exponents σ± ≡ ± |
ℜ
(σ1) = 0. A omplete desription of the linear behavior of the perturbation to the
ℑ
vortex (cid:28)lament requires only the alulation of f1(t), f2(t), and σ1 .

4.9 Numerial implementation

Although analyti methods exist to alulate the Floquet exponent, σ1 , they are not

pratial for the urrent ase beause of the ompliated time dependent oe(cid:30)ients

in the equations of motion, (4.27). Rather, a numerial solution over one period, T ,
of the motion is used to determine the Floquet funtions, f1 and f2 , and Floquet
exponent, σ1 , as a funtion of wave number, k , (cid:28)lament height, v0 , bakground (cid:29)ow,
U , and surfae geometry, h and L.

Of primary interest are the size of the growth parameter, σ+ , if non-zero, and the
), at whih the perturbation grows over one period. To determine

angle, θ = arctan( f2
f1

these quantities, the equations of motion, (4.27), are numerially integrated over one

period of motion from the initial onditions,

to obtain the resulting perturbation amplitudes at the end of one period of motion

over the surfae,

u(T ) and

v(T ). These quantities are ompared with the general

Floquet solution, (4.28), to obtain the equations,

4.10 Stability results

The wavy boundary signi(cid:28)antly a(cid:27)ets the evolution of the vortex (cid:28)lament. As a

representative example, a plot of the growth parameter for a (cid:28)lament propagating

over a boundary with height to length ratio

h
L = .1 is shown in Figure 4.3. Previously

stable wavenumbers beome unstable, and the wavenumber and growth parameter

of the maximally unstable mode inrease. This indiates that the hairpin vorties

evolving over a wavy boundary will be more tightly paked, having harateristi

spanwise wavelengths less then 100wu. The wavy boundary also has a signi(cid:28)ant

e(cid:27)et on the growth angle of the hairpin vorties. The angle of the unstable modes,

orresponding to the plot in Figure 4.3, is shown in Figure 4.4. The maximally

unstable mode over this wavy boundary now grows at an angle of approximately 34o
a signi(cid:28)ant hange to the 43o

growth over a (cid:29)at plate.

,

For very large values of

h
L , the strong foring is su(cid:30)ient to indue new instability

bands at previously stable wavenumbers, (Figure 4.5). Although this new instability

region has a smaller growth parameter than the primary instability, and will hene

not signi(cid:28)antly e(cid:27)et the evolution of a randomly perturbed vortex (cid:28)lament, it is

The dolphins' seret

By altering the dynamis of vortex (cid:28)laments, dolphin skin redues the rate of energy

transport to turbulene in the evolving turbulent boundary layer. This results in

a net redution of the drag indued by skin frition. The e(cid:27)etiveness of this drag

redution tehnique is limited by the ountering in(cid:29)uene of inreased skin frition

due to the form drag of the surfae ridges. Above a ritial ridge height,

, the

turbulent (cid:29)ow over the ridges separates, forming large eddies behind eah ridge, and

s

h
L

generates a large drag inrease. The drag redution at a given veloity will be optimal

at ridge heights just below this ritial value.

5.1 The e(cid:27)et of surfae orrugations

The pondermotive foring indued by the wavy boundary auses the vortex (cid:28)laments

over the ridges to streth at a maximally unstable angle, θ+ , that is signi(cid:28)antly

less then the maximally unstable angle for (cid:28)laments over a (cid:29)at boundary. This

dynamial e(cid:27)et ats over a range of veloities entered about an optimum veloity

determined by the wavelength of the surfae orrugations. For a dolphin with surfae

.61mm, the optimal swimming speed for this dynami

wavelength produe a signi(cid:28)ant redution in the maximally unstable angle for a

s . Although most e(cid:27)etive at this veloity, surfae ridges of this

ridges of wavelength L
e(cid:27)et is U

5 m

≃

≃

range of veloities between 2

15 m

−

s , (Figures 4.9-4.16). This result is in exellent

agreement with the reported swimming speed for this speies of dolphin.

The boundary layer vortex (cid:28)laments developing over suh ridges grow into hairpin

vorties inlined at the redued angle. Pakets of these hairpin vorties, now inlined

at an angle lower than the 43o

harateristi of hairpins over a (cid:29)at surfae, produe

a signi(cid:28)antly lower Reynolds stress within the turbulent boundary layer.

65

5.2

Impliations for turbulent energy transport

The Reynolds stress ontribution from hairpin vorties inlined at an angle θ+ , (2.8),
is proportional to sin(2θ+). Any deviation in hairpin inlination away from 45o

pro-

dues a redution of Reynolds stress, with a orresponding redution in the rate of

turbulent energy transport. Sine the dominant ontribution to turbulent energy

transport omes from the hairpin vorties, and the rate of energy transport is di-

retly proportional to the drag fore on the surfae, the perentage drag redution

due to the altered (cid:28)lament dynamis, d− , an be roughly equated with the perentage

redution in Reynolds stress,

d− ≃

The drag redution obtained using surfae ridges is diretly proportional to the degree

to whih the maximally unstable angle of the vortex (cid:28)lament may be lowered. This

angle depends upon the swimming veloity and orrugation wavelength, as well as on

the ridge height,

h
L . However, for ridge heights that are very large, the turbulent (cid:29)ow

over the ridges will separate, and form large stationary eddies behind eah ridge that

e(cid:27)etively lower the ridge height and signi(cid:28)antly inrease drag.

5.3 Turbulent (cid:29)ow separation

The drag redution is limited by the maximal ridge height allowed before turbulent

(cid:29)ow separation is indued. A linear model of turbulent boundary layer (cid:29)ow over a

sinusoidal surfae gives an estimate for the ritial ridge height,

, at whih sepa-

s

h
L

ration ours. This estimate is alulated, and on(cid:28)rmed by diret measurement, in

papers by Zilker and Hanratty [29℄,[30℄. For low frition veloities, ReL∗ = u∗L

ν < 630,

and hene for low bakground veloities, the ritial ridge height is alulated to be

s

h
L

≃

tendeny of turbulent (cid:29)ow to inhibit separation. For example, at ReL∗ ≃

.033. However, the ritial ridge height inreases with veloity, beause of the
6300, the
.1. Also, beause the shape of utaneous ridges

s

ritial ridge height beomes

h
L

≃

over dolphin skin are not exatly sinusoidal, but have slightly steeper peaks and wider

troughs, the ritial ridge height for separation to our over these ridges may vary

from the value for perfetly sinusoidal ridges. It is likely that the shape and distribu-

tion of the dolphins' utaneous ridges is adapted to maximize the ridge height, and

the dynamial e(cid:27)et on the vortex (cid:28)laments, without induing (cid:29)ow separation. Given

the struture of utaneous musle beneath the ridges, it is also very likely that the

dolphins adjust the height of their utaneous ridges to math the swimming veloity

(cid:21) keeping the ridge height slightly below the ritial value in order to maximize drag

redution.

5.4 Drag redution

The perent drag redution due to the redued inlination angle of the vortex instabil-

ity for a variety of surfae ridge heights is plotted in Figure 5.1. The drag redution at

the optimum swimming veloity of 5 m
s varies from 2% for very small ridges of height
h
h
L = .1. Sine it is likely that a dolphin inreases
L = .033 to 8% for ridges of height

the ridge height with swimming veloity, the perent drag redution ahieved is likely

to inrease with swimming veloity as a dolphin adjusts the ridge height to adapt to

the higher ritial ridge height.

5.5 Appliation

Man has long looked to the animal world for inspiration in e(cid:30)ient engineering de-

sign. The disovery and analysis of utaneous ridges in odontoetes presents another

engineering feat of mother nature that may be emulated and put to human use.

The drag redution obtained through the use of surfae orrugations will only be

signi(cid:28)ant if properly mathed to the seleted appliation. The ridge spaing, L, must

67

be tuned for a spei(cid:28) veloity range, and the ridge height must not be so great as

to indue separated (cid:29)ow between the ridges. Although a dolphin may vary the ridge

height to aommodate greater speeds, it is unlikely that an arti(cid:28)ial implementation

of variable ridge height would be ost e(cid:27)etive to manufature and employ. Therefore,

utaneous ridges may (cid:28)nd pratial appliation only when surfaes are expeted to

move through a (cid:29)uid at a steady veloity.

The optimal ridge spaing for (cid:29)uid (cid:29)owing over a (cid:29)at plate is alulated to be

L
120y∗ . This spaing depends only on the near boundary struture of the turbulent
boundary layer, partiularly the length of one wall unit, y∗ . The length of a wall unit

≃

over a smooth boundary may be determined experimentally by measuring the mean

surfae stress, τ0 , by observing the spanwise wavelength of the oherent strutures
present, λz ≃
example, an airraft whih regularly travels at a speed of 150 m

100y∗ , or, alternatively, by approximating a wall unit as y∗ ≃

27 ν

U . For

s may wish to employ

surfae orrugations of wavelength

The ridge height should be set just below the ritial value, to avoid separation.

A ridge height ratio of

.03 will always be below the ritial value, and produe a
surfae drag redution of 2%. However, the ritial value of the ridge height should be

h
L ≃

determined experimentally, so that the maximal ridge height may be employed and

the greatest drag redution ahieved. It is possible that ridge heights of ratio greater

than .1 may be allowed, produing an 8% or higher redution in surfae drag.

5.5.1 Experiment

Although several researhers have investigated the development of a turbulent bound-

ary layer over a wavy wall, through experiment and numerial simulation [29℄[30℄[31℄[32℄,

none have foused on the parameter range relevant to the (cid:29)ow of water over dolphin

skin, or given attention to the development and evolution of oherent strutures.

However, it should be straightforward to extend these investigations to the relevant

parameter range and thus determine the validity of the theoretial preditions.

The optimal ridge height for drag redution, the ritial height at whih separation

ours, should be determined experimentally. It would also be very usefull to deter-

mine if a swimming dolphin does inrease the utaneous ridge height with swimming

veloity, and to what degree; although it is not lear how suh an experiment would

be arried out. The dolphins have had sixty million years to optimize the redution

of drag through the ontrol of vortex (cid:28)lament dynamis, and there is still a great deal

to learn from these fasinating reatures.

Nonlinear traveling waves as a framework for

understanding turbulent drag reduction

By Wei Li, Li Xi and Michael D. Graham

(Received 2 February 2008)

Nonlinear traveling waves that are precursors to laminar-turbulent transition and cap-

ture the main structures of the turbulent buﬀer layer have recently been found to exist

in all the canonical parallel ﬂow geometries. We study the eﬀect of polymer additives on

these “exact coherent states” (ECS), in the plane Poiseuille geometry. Many key aspects

of the turbulent drag reduction phenomenon are found, including: delay in transition to

turbulence; drag reduction onset threshold; diameter and concentration eﬀects. Further-

more, examination of the ECS existence region leads to a distinct prediction, consistent

with experiments, regarding the nature of the maximum drag reduction regime. Speciﬁ-

cally, at suﬃciently high wall shear rates, viscoelasticity is found to completely suppress

the normal (i.e. streamwise-vortex-dominated) dynamics of the near wall region, indi-

cating that the maximum drag reduction regime is dominated by a distinct class of ﬂow

structures.

1. Introduction

The reduction of turbulent drag by polymer additives has received much attention since

it was ﬁrst observed experimentally in 1940s (See reviews by Lumley (1969); Virk (1975);

2

Wei Li, Li Xi and Michael D. Graham

McComb (1990); Graham (2004)). For a given ﬂow rate, small polymer concentrations,

on the order of ten parts per million by weight, can reduce the pressure drop in pipe or

channel ﬂow, for example, by 50% or greater. After six decades of research, the subject

remains an active area of research, in part because of applications but also because it

lies at the intersection of two complex and important ﬁelds, turbulence and polymer

dynamics. A better understanding of this phenomenon may in turn yield insights into

both the dynamics of drag-reducing ﬂuids and of turbulent ﬂows. The goal of the present

work is to address turbulent drag reduction in the context of the dominant structures in

the turbulent buﬀer layer, an approach which turns out to touch on many key aspects of

the drag reduction phenomenon.

We focus here on pressure-driven channel ﬂow with average wall shear stress τw, of

a ﬂuid with dynamic viscosity ηs (in the absence of polymer), density ρ and kinematic

viscosity ν = ηs/ρ. The average streamwise velocity Uavg and half-channel height l deﬁne

outer scales for the ﬂow. Inner scales are the friction velocity uτ =

τw/ρ and the

near-wall length scale lw = ν/uτ . As usual, quantities expressed in terms of these so-

p

called “wall units” are denoted with a superscript +. The friction Reynolds number

Reτ = uτ l/ν is simply the half channel height expressed in wall units. The Weissenberg

number is denoted Wi = λ ˙γw = λu2

τ /ν, where λ is polymer relaxation time and ˙γw is

the average wall shear rate. Experimental results for a given ﬂuid and ﬂow geometry lie

on curves of constant elasticity parameter El = 2λν/l2.

In channel or pipe ﬂow, drag reduction results are often represented on a Prandtl-von

Karman plot, Uavg/uτ vs. log Reτ (

log Wi

log El), shown schematically in Fig. 1a.

Point A corresponds to transition to turbulence, which in Newtonian ﬂow occurs at

45 (Carlson et al. 1982). One typical experimental path for a given polymer solu-

exceeds a critical value (point B), the slope of the data increases from the Newtonian

value, indicating onset of drag reduction. As Reτ increases, data eventually approaches

a new curve at point C. This curve, the so-called Maximum Drag Reduction (MDR)

asymptote, is insensitive to polymer concentration, molecular weight or polymer species

– all results collapse onto it at large Reτ ; it is a universal feature of drag reduction by

polymers. For large channels or low polymer concentrations, the value of Reτ at the onset

of drag reduction is independent of polymer concentration and corresponds to a critical

Weissenberg number. For small channels or large concentrations, however, diameter and

concentration eﬀects have been observed experimentally (Virk 1975): speciﬁcally, there

exists a critical pipe diameter below which, or a critical polymer concentration above

which the ﬂow behavior directly transits from laminar ﬂow to the maximum drag reduc-

tion curve as Reτ increases. An experimental path showing this eﬀect is labeled “exp2”;

transition from laminar ﬂow to MDR occurs at point D.

Wei Li, Li Xi and Michael D. Graham

Studies of drag-reducing ﬂuids indicate that near the onset of drag reduction, the ef-

fects of the polymer are conﬁned primarily to the buﬀer layer region of the ﬂow (Virk

1975; Donohue et al. 1972). Experimental observations and DNS studies show that the

dominant structures in the buﬀer layer are pairs of counter-rotating, streamwise-aligned

vortices (Robinson 1991; Jeong et al. 1997). These vortices pull slower moving ﬂuids away

from the wall, forming low-speed, streamwise velocity streaks. In drag-reducing ﬂows,

these structures are modiﬁed by polymers: the buﬀer region thickens (Virk 1975), the co-

herent structures in this region shift to larger scales (Donohue et al. 1972; Sureshkumar et al.

1997; den Toonder et al. 1997), and the bursting rate decreases (Donohue et al. 1972).

Recent experimental results (Warholic et al. 1999, 2001) reveal that in the maximum

drag reduction region the ejections from the wall are eliminated and the near-wall vor-

tices that sustain turbulence in a Newtonian ﬂuid are completely destroyed. Low-speed

streamwise velocity streaks are essentially absent. These observations suggest that the

coherent structures in buﬀer layer region are crucial in addressing rheological drag re-

duction in wall-bounded turbulent ﬂows.

A recent advance in the understanding of these important near-wall structures has

come with the recognition that, in all the canonical parallel geometries (plane Cou-

ette, plane Poiseuille, pipe) the Navier-Stokes equations support nonlinear traveling wave

states, the family of so-called “exact coherent states” or ECS (Nagata 1986; Clever & Busse

1997; Waleﬀe 1998, 2001, 2003; Faisst & Eckhardt 2003; Wedin & Kerswell 2004). Jim´enez

and coworkers (Jim´enez & Pinelli 1999; Jim´enez & Simens 2001) have found related

states in spatially ﬁltered direct numerical simulations (DNS), showing the autonomous

nature of the near-wall behavior. The ﬂow structure of these states is a mean shear and a

pair of staggered streamwise-aligned counter-rotating vortices, as is found in the turbu-

lent buﬀer layer. In the plane Poiseuille geometry, ECS come into existence at Reτ of 44.2

(Waleﬀe 2003), very close to the experimentally observed Reτ of

45 for the transition to

turbulence(Carlson et al. 1982). The spanwise wavelength L+

z = 105.5 of the ECS at on-

set closely matches the streak spacing of

∼

over a large range of Reynolds numbers (Robinson 1991). Direct numerical simulations

of turbulence in “minimal channel ﬂow”, i.e., ﬂow in the smallest computational domain

that reproduces the velocity ﬁeld statistics of near-wall turbulence, give a range for the

streamwise length L+

x of 250

350, compared to L+

x = 273.7 for the ECS, and a spanwise

−

length that is again approximately 100 wall units (Jim´enez & Moin 1991). It should be

pointed out that this minimum channel contains a single wavelength of a wavy streak

and a pair of quasi-streamwise vortices, which is the same structure seen in the ECS.

A conditional sampling study of coherent structures in a larger scale DNS (Jeong et al.

1997) indicates that the dominant structures near the wall in turbulent channel ﬂow

are counter-rotating, streamwise-aligned vortices with a streamwise length L+

250, a

spanwise length L+

100 and a wall-normal size of y+

50, which agrees with the

z ∼

scales of the ECS at onset. The ECS also capture the location of the peak, at y+

12, in

≈

the production of turbulent kinetic energy for wall-bounded turbulence (Kim et al. 1987;

Li et al. 2005). In short, the ECS are precursors to turbulence and their structure and

length scales closely match experimentally observed near-wall behavior.

Because the ﬁrst eﬀects of polymer arise in the buﬀer region, whose structure the ECS

evidently capture, these ﬂows provide a natural starting point for understanding drag

reduction. In prior work, we have studied the initial eﬀects of viscoelasticity on ECS in

the plane Couette and plane Poiseuille geometries (Stone et al. 2002; Stone & Graham

2003; Stone et al. 2004; Li et al. 2005). The primary eﬀect was found to be the weakening

of the streamwise vortices, as well as changes in the statistics of the velocity ﬂuctuations

that are consistent with experimental observations at low levels of drag reduction. The

6

present work takes a broader view, examining the region of parameter space (Re, Wi) in

which ECS exist and its connection to experimental observations.

2. Formulation

We consider pressure-driven ﬂow with no-slip boundary conditions; vx, vy, and vz

are streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise components of the velocity, v, respectively.

Reﬂection symmetry is imposed at the channel centerline. The laminar centerline velocity,

U , and the half-channel height, l, are used to scale velocity and position, respectively.

The average wall shear rate ˙γw is given by 2U/l. Time, t, is scaled with l/U , and pressure,

p, with ρU 2. The stress due to the polymer, τ p, is nondimensionalized with the polymer

elastic modulus, G = ηp/λ, where ηp is the polymer contribution to the zero-shear rate

viscosity. The momentum balance and the equation of continuity are

The conservation and constitutive equations are solved through a Picard iteration in

a traveling reference frame – the wave speed is part of the solution. A Newtonian ECS,

as computed in Waleﬀe (1998), is ﬁrst used to calculate the polymer stress tensor, τ p,

by inserting the velocity ﬁeld in the evolution equation for α and integrating for a short

length of time, usually one time unit (l/U ). For this τ p, a steady state of the momentum

and continuity equations is found by Newton iteration. The resulting velocity ﬁeld, v, is

used to compute the new τ p, and the process is repeated until the velocity and polymer

ﬁeld converge to a steady state.

The momentum and continuity equations are discretized using a Fourier-Chebyshev

formulation with typically a 9

with a third-order, compact upwind diﬀerence scheme (Lele 1992; Min et al. 2001) in

the x and z directions and Chebyshev collocation in the y direction. In this as in most

previous computational studies of polymers in turbulent ﬂows, we have found it neces-

sary to add an artiﬁcial stress diﬀusion term 1

2α, to the right-hand side of Eq.

(2.3) to achieve numerical stability. The Schmidt number, Sc, which is the ratio of the

momentum diﬀusivity to stress diﬀusivity, is set to value of 1.0. This value of Sc, though

artiﬁcially small, is greater or of the same order of magnitude as that used in many

DNS studies (Sureshkumar et al. 1997; Ptasinski et al. 2003; Sureshkumar & Beris 1995;

Sibilla & Baron 2002). In the range of Sc where solutions can be obtained, the bifurcation

3. Results and discussion

We study the Newtonian and viscoelastic ECS at ﬁxed streamwise and spanwise

lengths: Lx = 2π/1.0148 and Lz = 2π/2.633 (i.e., L+

x = 273.7 and L+

z = 105.5 at

Reτ = 44.2). This wavelength pair is where ECS ﬁrst come into existence in the New-

tonian case. The trivial base state in this geometry (laminar Poiseuille ﬂow) exists at

all Re. At Re

977 (Reτ = 44.2) for the Newtonian ﬂow, two new solutions appear via

≈

a saddle-node bifurcation as shown in Fig. 2a. These are the ECS. These solutions are

plotted using the maximum in the root mean square wall-normal velocity ﬂuctuations for

the solution, v′2

. (Hereafter, an overbar indicates that the variable is averaged over the

streamwise and spanwise directions.) The solutions with higher maximum wall-normal

velocity at a given Re are called “high drag” solutions due to their lower mean velocity

at the centerline of the channel compared to the “low drag” solutions. All results in this

paper are for the “high drag” states. Although both solutions are unstable, their status as

precursors to transition and their structural similarity to buﬀer layer turbulence suggest

that they are saddle points that underlie in part the strange attractor of turbulent ﬂow.

Fig. 2a indicates that the addition of polymer changes the Reynolds number Remin at

which the ECS come into existence. Curves of ECS existence boundaries Remin vs. Wi

are given for two parameter sets by the thick solid curves on Fig. 2b. These separate the

region where the ECS can exist (above the curves) from the region where no ECS exist,

for the given value of Ex. While at low Wi, there is a slight decrease in Remin from the

Newtonian value, onceWi exceeds 45, Remin for Ex = 100 is more than doubled. This

dramatic increase in Remin after onset is consistent with the experimental observation

that the transition to turbulence in a polymer solution is delayed to higher Re than in

the Newtonian case (Giles & Pettit 1967; White & McEligot 1970; Escudier et al. 1999).

We will refer to the Wi above which Remin for the viscoelastic ECS is greater than for

the Newtonian ECS as the onset Weissenberg number Wionset for drag reduction. Fig.

2b shows that Wionset ≈
or concentration (β). Furthermore, in simulations at constant Re, it is found that the

15, a value which is insensitive to polymer extensibility (Ex)

value where the centerline mean velocity Umax ﬁrst exceeds the Newtonian value – the

nearly vertical set of points in Fig. 2b – is also located at W i

15 in the parameter

≈

regime that has been examined here. This onset value is high by about a factor of two

compared to values predicted by two recent viscoelastic DNS studies (Housiadas & Beris

2003; Min et al. 2003), but in those studies El was signiﬁcantly smaller, and the onset

Reynolds number correspondingly larger, than the values considered here.

Figure 3a shows mean velocity proﬁles at six diﬀerent sets of parameter values, each

corresponding to a point on the existence boundary for the ECS (i.e. a bifurcation point).

Remarkably, they all fall on the same curve, when plotted in outer units. Therefore, at

least for the values of Re and Wi that are currently accessible in our simulations, we

observe that mean velocity proﬁles at onset of the ECS have a universal form.

We now turn to the study of the evolution of the ECS along some experimental paths,

lines of constant El. Two such paths, the thin solid lines with hollow symbols, are shown

in Fig. 2b. Consider ﬁrst the case El = 0.010; as Re and Wi increase, the path inter-

sects the ECS existence boundary at point A and the drag reduction onset threshold

curve at point B, where the transition to turbulence and the onset of drag reduction

occur, respectively. Turning to the case El = 0.019, mean velocity proﬁles expressed in

wall units are shown for various values of Re in Fig. 3b. For this parameter set, drag

reduction is observed immediately upon onset of the ECS. Along with drag reduction,

enhanced streamwise velocity ﬂuctuations and the reduced wall-normal and spanwise ve-

locity ﬂuctuations are found, consistent with experimental observations and DNS results

at low to moderate degrees of drag reduction (Virk 1975; Sureshkumar et al. 1997). The

eﬀect of viscoelasticity can also be observed in the reduced Reynolds shear stress and

ultimately can be traced to the suppression of the streamwise vortices by the viscoelas-

ticity (Stone et al. 2002, 2004; Li et al. 2005). Figure 4 shows ﬁelds of vx and trτ p on

the El = 0.019 path at Wi = 41.8, Re = 2200 (the point just left of the label “C” on

Figure 2b). The region of high polymer stress clearly “wraps around” the streamwise

vortices, and the corresponding polymer force (

∇

τ p) is in direct opposition to the

∼

·

vortex motions.

Continuing upward in Re and Wi at El = 0.019, the path re-intersects the ECS ex-

istence boundary, at point C in Fig. 2b. (We suspect that this will also happen in the

El = 0.010 case, but at higher Re and Wi than are accessible with our current com-

putational approach.) Above this point the ﬂow can no longer sustain these ECS; vis-

coelasticity completely suppresses the near-wall vortical structures. This result is con-

sistent with experimental observations that, in the MDR regime, the eruptions of low-

momentum ﬂuid from the wall are eliminated and the near-wall streamwise vortices are

completely destroyed (Warholic et al. 1999, 2001). Experimental results also show that

in the MDR regime, the Reynolds shear stress is much smaller than the Newtonian

12

Wei Li, Li Xi and Michael D. Graham

value (Warholic et al. 1999, 2001; Ptasinski et al. 2001), and streamwise velocity ﬂuctu-

ations decrease to levels close to or below the Newtonian value (Warholic et al. 1999).

All these observations suggest that the turbulent production and dissipation take place

by a diﬀerent mechanism in the MDR regime than at lower degrees of drag reduction.

Although our study does not reveal this mechanism directly, it does suggest that the

disappearance of ECS is related to the MDR regime. This result encourages us to take a

broader view, examining the region of parameter space (Re, Wi) in which ECS exist and

its connection to experimental observations.

Fig. 1b is a schematic based on the results shown in Fig. 2b. Line 1 represents the ECS

existence boundary at constant Ex. Line 2 represents the drag reduction onset threshold,

which separates the ECS existence region into “turbulence without drag reduction” and

“turbulence with low or moderate drag reduction” regions. Line “exp1” represents an

experimental path at constant El, which passes through the ECS existence region. In this

case, as Re (and Wi) increases, this path intersects with the ECS existence boundary at

point A and drag reduction onset threshold at point B, where the transition to turbulence

and the drag reduction onset occur, respectively. Note the correspondence with points A

and B on the schematic Prandtl-von Karman plot, Fig. 1a, as well as on Fig. 2b. As Re and

Wi continue to increase along this path, the system will eventually exit the ECS existence

region at point C, where the ﬂow can no longer sustain these ECS. Experimental results

show that in the MDR regime, near-wall streamwise vortical structures are essentially

absent. Our results together with this experimental observation suggest that the loss

of ECS may be somehow related to the approach of the MDR regime, in which other

types of coherent traveling wave states (temporally intermittent structures, hairpins,

Tollmien-Schlichting waves, intrinsically elastic structures,. . . ) may be unmasked and

become dominant. This possibility is represented by line 3 in Fig. 1b, a hypothetical

existence boundary for a distinct class of ﬂow structures that exists at high Wi. In

Viscoelastic nonlinear traveling waves

13

this scenario, the crossing of path exp1 across point C represents the transition to the

maximum drag reduction regime. This scenario, incorporating transition to turbulence,

onset of drag reduction and approach of the MDR regime is consistent with the behavior

on experimental path exp1 shown in Fig. 1a.

Now consider the experimental path “exp2” on Fig. 1b. This path corresponds to a

value of El that does not intersect with ECS existence region at all. For the conditions

β = 0.97, Ex = 100 shown on Fig. 2b, this situation arises if El & 0.024. The scenario on

Fig. 1b would predict in this case that, with the increase of Re and Wi, the ﬂow behavior

directly transits from laminar to MDR at point D. As El is inversely proportional to l2

(or R2 in pipe ﬂow) this prediction is consistent with experiments in small diameter pipes

– the “diameter eﬀect” (Virk 1975), as exempliﬁed by experimental path exp2 in Fig. 1a.

The “concentration eﬀect” can also be captured by this scenario, as we now describe. The

quantity S = 1

β is proportional to polymer concentration in dilute solution. Using S,

−

the parameters Ex and El can be written as Ex = 2

S) and El = 2ληs/ρl2(1

S).

3 bS/(1

−

−

Thus while El is virtually unchanged by a change in S, Ex is proportional to it. An

increase in Ex compresses the ECS existence boundary leftward and eventually a given

experimental path can no longer intersect the ECS existence region, resulting again in

ﬂow behavior that directly transits from laminar to MDR.

Finally, we observe that the existence boundaries can be interpreted in terms of length

scales. Recall that the half-height of the channel, expressed in wall units, is simply Reτ =

√2Re. Thus the existence boundary corresponds to the minimum half-channel height in

which an ECS can exist, as a function of Wi. Points where a line of constant El intersects

the existence boundary are points where the channel height and the minimum height for

the existence of an ECS coincide.

4. Conclusions

Many observations of drag reduction in dilute polymer solutions are mirrored by the

eﬀect of viscoelasticity on the channel ﬂow ECS discovered by Waleﬀe (Waleﬀe 2001,

2003). The transition behaviors from laminar to turbulent ﬂow, from no drag reduction

to drag reduction, and from moderate drag reduction to MDR can be connected to the

birth, evolution and death of these ECS, respectively. Our results and the scenario that

we infer from them yield explicit predictions, testable by DNS, with regard to all these

phenomena.

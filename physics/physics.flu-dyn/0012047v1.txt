Abstract

The anomalous scaling exponents ζn of the longitudinal structure functions

Sn for homogeneous isotropic turbulence are derived from the Navier-Stokes

equations by using ﬁeld theoretic methods to develop a low energy approxi-

mation in which the Kolmogorov theory is shown to act eﬀectively as a mean

ﬁeld theory. The corrections to the Kolmogorov exponents are expressed in

terms of the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators which occur

in the deﬁnition of Sn. These are calculated from the anomalous scaling of

the appropriate class of nonlinear Green’s function, using an uv ﬁxed point

of the renormalisation group, which thereby establishes the connection with

the dynamics of the turbulence. The main result is an algebraic expression

for ζn, which contains no adjustable constants.

It is valid at orders n below

g−1
∗ , where g∗ is the ﬁxed point coupling constant. This expression is used to

calculate ζn for orders in the range n = 2 to 10, and the results are shown to

be in good agreement with experimental data, key examples being ζ2 = 0.7,

ζ3 = 1 and ζ6 = 1.8.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of homogeneous isotropic turbulence has as its aim the derivation of the

statistical features of small scale velocity ﬂuctuations at high Reynolds numbers, based

on the assumption that they exhibit universal characteristics independent of the form of

the large scale ﬂow structures [1-3]. A key quantity of interest is the longitudinal velocity

increment, v+ − v−, where v± = v1(x ± r/2, y, z, t), the velocity component v1 and the

separation distance r both being in the same direction, here the x-axis. An empirical fact

is that its nth order moment, the longitudinal structure function Sn(r), deﬁned by

Sn(r) = h(v+ − v−)ni ,

(1)

2

exhibits multiscaling. That is, the exponent ζn, deﬁned by the scaling relation

is a nonlinear function of the order n. This behaviour is not explained by the classical

turbulence theory of Kolmogorov [4] which yields a linear dependence

Sn(r) ∼ rζn,

ζ Kol
n =

n

.

(2)

(3)

Moreover, the amount by which ζn diﬀers from ζ Kol

n

, called the anomaly, has proved stub-

bornly resistant to attempts at quantitative explanation [1-3,5,6]. The obstacle to progress

with the theory is the strong nonlinearity of the governing Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. In

this paper, our aim is to show how modern statistical ﬁeld theory can be used to overcome

this diﬃculty and provide theoretical predictions for ζn, which agree well with turbulent ﬂow

data.

The idea that statistical ﬁeld theory can be brought to bear on the problem of turbu-

lence is not itself new. Indeed, interest in describing turbulence in terms of the underlying

functional probability distribution of the velocity ﬁeld, together with its corresponding gen-

erating functional W, has a long history [5,6]. But such work has suﬀered from the weakness

of relying on conventional perturbation theory to eﬀect closure of the statistical hierarchy,

whereas it is widely believed that a non-perturbative treatment is necessary, because the

NS equations lack a small parameter. Consequently, progress with this approach has been

disappointing.

The question is whether we can ﬁnd a middle course, which avoids the limitations of

conventional perturbation theory, while not demanding an intractable non-perturbative ap-

proach. Here we explore the possibility of formulating a more eﬃcient perturbation theory

by developing a zero-order solution which already accounts for the dominant nonlinear inter-

actions, in an attempt, as it were, to deplete the eﬀect of the nonlinearity. We shall do this

by adopting a more general quadratic form in W in place of the viscous form which arises

naturally. The modiﬁed quadratic form is determined self-consistently from the NS nonlin-

earity using the linear response function and the energy equation. In the inertial range, it

3

leads directly to the Kolmogorov distribution, after allowing for the kinematic eﬀect of the

sweeping of the smaller scales by the larger ones. The diﬀerence between these quadratic

forms then appears as a perturbation, which, as we shall see, is not critical, provided that

the force spectrum function is non-zero only at small wavenumbers and yields a ﬁnite input

power.

Having incorporated the dominant nonlinearities which are responsible for the turbulence

energy cascade into the zero-order solution, what is then lacking is the eﬀect of the ﬂuctuating

dissipation rate, which is the well-known defect of the Kolmogorov theory [5].

In this

approach, the perturbation theory is then, in eﬀect, only required to accommodate the

residual coupling associated with these ﬂuctuations, which are directly responsible for the

anomalies. The fact that the anomalies are small, and associated with a weak residual

coupling, provides good reason to expect that a small expansion parameter might emerge,

thereby rendering the problem accessible to perturbation theory, essentially by means of a

standard loop-expansion of the generating functional.

Although the use of the modiﬁed quadratic form as an initial approximation would appear

to be an attractive option, providing a sound physical basis for the approximate evaluation

of the generating functional, it poses severe technical problems, the most signiﬁcant being

the occurrence of divergences at higher orders in perturbation theory, due to the incomplete

representation of the large scale ﬂow. These divergences are of two types: power divergences

(including power × logarithmic), which are associated with the sweeping and pure loga-

rithmic divergences, which describe the cascade process. On the other hand, statistical ﬁeld

theory [7], provides the mathematical techniques needed to compensate for such divergences,

in the form of the well-known processes of resummation and renormalisation. In particular,

renormalisation [8] provides a procedure whereby the scale invariance in (2) can be recovered

from a divergent theory, yielding the exponents in terms of the anomalous dimensions of the

composite operators appearing in (1), which we can calculate from the appropriate nonlinear

Green’s functions. The modiﬁed quadratic form itself follows uniquely from the requirement

for the absence of non-renormalisable terms, after renormalising the basic parameters of W

4

and allowing for sweeping.

Fortunately, sweeping eﬀects do not pose an insuperable obstacle, notwithstanding that

the initial formulation is Eulerian. Indeed, we show that the power divergences associated

with sweeping can be removed by introducing a single sweeping interaction term, which

can be derived from the generating functional itself using a random Galilean transforma-

tion of the velocity ﬁeld, having an rms convection speed which is calculated from the NS

nonlinearity. The application of this transformation does not, of course, aﬀect the values

of Sn(r) and, thus, enables the straining interactions which determine the spectrum to be

separated from the background of sweeping convection, yielding, in eﬀect, quasi-Lagrangian

forms.

In this way, as we shall show below, it proves possible to demonstrate multiscaling

and calculate the anomalies of the structure functions accurately.

II. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

Our starting point is the NS equations, describing ﬂow in an incompressible ﬂuid of unit

density, velocity v, kinematic viscosity ν and pressure p, and driven by a random solenoidal

stirring force f, which are

∂v
∂t

+ v·∇v = −∇p + ¯ν∇2v + f,

and

Suppose that

(4)

(5)

(6)

is the solution of (4) at the space-time point ˆx = (x, t), corresponding to a force f(ˆx), which

has a Gaussian probability distribution P(f). Then the generating functional W for the

correlation functions of the velocity ﬁeld can be written as the functional integral

div v = 0.

v(ˆx) = V(ˆx|f)

5

where the source term is given by

W =

exp(S)P(f) Df,

S(J) =

J(ˆx) · V(ˆx|f) dˆx,

Z

R

and the correlators follow by functional diﬀerentiation with respect to the source ﬁeld J(ˆx).

Given that we cannot obtain an explicit expression for the solution (6), the crux of the

problem is how to approximate (7) with the accuracy required to calculate the ζn. In our

approach, as indicated above, we prove that the Kolmogorov theory can be used eﬀectively

as a mean ﬁeld theory in a saddle-point evaluation of (7), and that this leads to an expansion

which has a genuinely small coupling constant.

Within the context of a ﬁeld theoretic interpretation of (7), each term of the binomial

expansion of (1) must be regarded as an operator product of the usual Wilson type, (see eg

[7,8] ). Correspondingly, the powers of v± must be treated as composite operators, which,

in accordance with standard procedures [7], must be generated from W by independent

sources. Here, our aim is to limit the composite operators that need to be allowed for to

those which appear explicitly in the deﬁnition of Sn(r), as given in (1). To this end, we

deﬁne a set of longitudinal composite operators Os(ˆx), for s = 2, 3, 4, ..., by

which we generate from W by adding to the source term (8), the additional term

We also need to include in the deﬁnition of W a means of establishing the vital link

between the time-independent deﬁnition of Sn(r) and the dynamics of the turbulence. This

requires the introduction of a dynamic response operator, which we deﬁne to be the func-

tional diﬀerentiation operator

and this completes the deﬁnition of W. Thus, (7) and (13) provide the foundation of our

approach to the calculation of ζn. However, before we proceed with this calculation, we need

to cast W into a conventional ﬁeld theory form, and introduce the modiﬁed quadratic form.

A straightforward method of transforming (7) into a conventional ﬁeld theory form is to

replace P(f) by its functional Fourier transform and then integrate over f. This is the stage

at which we make explicit use of the NS equations. Essentially, to eﬀect the transformation,

we change our perspective by replacing the velocity ﬁeld V(f) generated by the force f,by

the force F(v) needed to excite a particular realisation v of the ﬂow ﬁeld. The operator (11)

is then replaced by an equivalent conjugate vector ﬁeld

v.

To carry out this transformation, we work in the Fourier domain setting

e

v(ˆx) =

exp(iˆk · ˆx) v(ˆk)Dˆk,

Z

where ˆk denotes (k,ω), so that ˆk · ˆx = ωt − k · x, while Dˆk = dωdk/(2π)4. Then, from (4)

and (5), we have

Fα(ˆk, v) = G0(ˆk)−1vα(ˆk) −

The notation here is the following. G0(ˆk) is the zero-order approximation to the response

function G(ˆk) deﬁned below in (64) and (65), namely

(15)

τν(k)−1 = ¯νk2.

Pαβγ(k) is the NS vertex deﬁned by

Pαβγ(k) = kβPαγ(k) + kγPαβ(k).

where

Pαβ(k) = δαβ − kαkβ/k2.

Next we write the Gaussian distribution of f in the form

where the force spectrum function h(k) is an arbitrary function which is assumed to be

peaked near the origin so that the power input

h(k)dk is ﬁnite. We now change the

functional integration over f in (7) to an integration over v by means of the transformation

The expression (18) casts W into the form of an MSR type functional integral [9].

Now the quadratic form appearing in (19) does not provide a good initial approximation

for inertial range scaling because, of course, it merely describes the viscous decay of an

externally driven random ﬂow, with no account taken of the nonlinear interactions. It is

thus essential in developing an expansion theorem for (18) to introduce a more appropriate

quadratic form. Now the general theory of quadratic forms in a Hilbert space indicates that

we can introduce at most two functions.These can be taken as an apparent force spectrum

D0(k) and an eﬀective micro timescale τ0(k), which are related to the energy in wavemode

k, Q(k), by

Q(k) = τ0(k)D0(k).

(21)

The modiﬁed quadratic form in L(v, ˜v) is then obtained, ﬁrstly, by replacing h(k) with

D0(k) and, secondly, by replacing the viscous timescale τν(k) by the the eﬀective timescale

τ0(k), so that the viscous propagator (15) in (14) is replaced by

G0(k) =

1
iω + τ0(k)−1 .

Thus, we now have in place of (19)

L(v,

v) =

˜vα(−ˆk)D0(k)Pαβ(k)˜vβ(ˆk)Dˆk − i

˜vα(−ˆk)Fα(ˆk, v)Dˆk,

in which D0(k) and τ0(k) are, as yet, unknown functions to be determined in an appropriate

e

way from the energy equation and the linear response function. The idea that one should

replace the viscous quadratic form by a modiﬁed form was suggested originally in [10], where

it was used in conjunction with a variational principle based on an entropy functional,but

recent work [11] has shown that this approach contains an arbitrary element. However,

we shall not need to invoke any additional principle, because we shall be able to deduce

the modiﬁed quadratic form in a self-consistent way from the 1-loop expansion, as we have

already indicated.

9

The introduction of the modiﬁed quadratic form as a basis for an expansion theorem for

(18) requires the inclusion of the diﬀerence terms as perturbations, which contributes an

additional term to L given by

∆L0 =

˜vα(−ˆk){h(k) − D0(k)}Pαβ(k)˜vβ(ˆk)Dˆk − i

˜vα(−ˆk){τν(k)−1 − τ0(k)−1}vα(ˆk)Dˆk.

Z

(23)

These terms have the same form as the counterterms introduced below in (27) to accommo-

date the pure logarithmic divergences but their role, as we shall see, is not critical as regards

calculating the inertial range exponents.

The derivation of the functions D0(k) and τ0(k) occurring in the modiﬁed quadratic

form entails a detailed discussion of sweeping convection, the structure of the Feynman

diagrams associated with the loop expansion of W and the establishment of the condition

for the absence from the linear response function of non-renormalisable terms. We shall defer

detailed discussion of these topics until Sections VII and VIII and, meanwhile, proceed with

the calculation of the anomalous exponents by anticipating their forms, which, in the inertial

range, are

and

D0(k) = D0k−3,

τ0(k)−1 = ν0k2/3.

(24)

(25)

Clearly, these forms imply that the zero order solution behaves in the inertial range as if the

ﬂuid were stirred by a random force with a k−3 force correlation spectrum and responds to it

with a Lagrangian time scale ∝ k−2/3. Thus, they lead to the Kolmogorov distribution.We

shall explain how this result follows from the generating functional in Section VIII. The

advantage of this approximation is that it achieves a prime requirement of any eﬃcient

perturbation theory, which is a zero-order approximation that already closely approximates

the desired solution.

10

On the other hand, as we have indicated, the resulting perturbation theory yields diver-

gences at higher orders. But these divergences can be handled by standard renormalisation

procedures. Fortunately, as regards the calculation of ζn, we need consider only logarith-

mic divergences. As discussed above, this is because the power divergences represent the

kinematic eﬀect of the sweeping of small scales by larger scales. Indeed, as we shall show

in Section VII, such terms are precisely those which can be generated by applying a ran-

dom Galilean transformation of the velocity ﬁeld to W. Consequently, they can be cancelled

by introducing the appropriate vertex into W , yielding quasi-Lagrangian approximations.

Hence, from a purely practical calculational point of view, the eﬀect of sweeping can be

removed from the calculation of ζn simply by discarding power divergences. We are then

left with the logarithmic divergences, which we can sum by renormalisation group methods.

Thus, an important implication of using the modiﬁed quadratic form as an initial approx-

imation for the calculation of ζn is that renormalisation becomes a necessary preliminary.

So we need to identify the counterterms which arise in W under renormalisation and obtain

the transformation rule which connects the bare and renormalised generating functionals.

Renormalisation is applied to the viscosity and force constants appearing in (24) and (25)

in the usual way by introducing renormalisation constants Zν and ZD, which relate their

bare values ν0 and D0 to their renormalised replacements ν and D by

ν0 = νZν and D0 = DZD.

This generates counterterms in (19) for the elementary ﬁelds (v and

v) given by

We conclude this section by giving the transformation which relates the generating func-

tional of the bare correlation functions WB to its corresponding renormalised form WR.

To provide a convenient means of handling the dependence of the correlation and response

functions on the dimensional parameters ν0 and D0, we rescale V and f by introducing bare

These relations follow from two requirements. First, the form of the NS equations (14) must

Second, we have to satisfy the crucial requirement that P(f), as given in (16), remains

invariant under renormalisation. Indeed, satisfaction of these conditions implies the desired

four stages. First, we use (31) and the binomial expansion of (1) to develop a short distance

expansion for Sn(r), by substituting an operator product expansion (OPE) [7,8] for each

term, based on the operators (9). As shown in Section III, this yields the scaling of Sn(r) in

terms of uv ﬁxed point values of standard RG functions. The second stage of the calculation

is to demonstrate that the required uv ﬁxed point of the RG actually exists, and then to

deduce the corresponding ﬁxed point coupling constant g∗. This is done in Section IV by

considering the renormalisation of the linear response function, using the renormalised func-

tional in the form obtained from (18). The third stage is to calculate the speciﬁc ﬁxed point

RG parameters which give the anomalous component of ζn. To do this, we have to consider

13

the renormalisation of appropriate nonlinear Green’s functions involving the composite op-

erators deﬁned in (9). These are identiﬁed and evaluated in Section V. Having calculated

the anomalous scaling exponent −τnp of the pth term in the binomial expansion of Sn(r), in

the fourth and ﬁnal stage of the calculation, we derive a simple algebraic expression for ζn

by maximising τnp, with respect to integer values of p, and subtracting this maximum from

the Kolmogorov value (3). The results obtained for ζn are presented in Section VI, where

they are shown to be in good agreement with experimental measurements at all orders for

which reliable data exists. Finally, the mathematical proofs, deferred during the calculation

of the exponents, are presented in Sections VII-IX, and comprise: (a) the demonstration

that sweeping eﬀects can be eliminated by means of a random Galilean transformation of the

velocity ﬁeld; (b) the derivation of the modiﬁed quadratic form from the 1-loop expansion;

and (c) the derivation of the dominant terms of the OPEs.

III. THE STRUCTURE FUNCTION EXPANSIONS

In applying the OPE technique to (1) the ﬁrst point to appreciate is that the orders

n = 2, n = 3 and n ≥ 4 require separate treatment. The factor distinguishing S2 and S3

from the higher order Sn is that the latter involve composite operator products, whereas S2

and S3 do not. Also, S3 is exceptional in representing a transition at which corrections to

the Kolmogorov exponents (3) change from positive at n = 2 to negative at n > 4, with

no correction occurring at n = 3 in accordance with the known exact scaling law, which is

veriﬁed, within the present framework, in Section VIII. This sign change is caused precisely

because composite operator products appear in Sn when n > 4.

We begin, therefore, with the relatively straightforward case of S2. According to (1), we

have

S2(r) = 2

v2

− hv+v−i

,

(32)

(cid:11)
which shows that the scaling of S2 is determined by the behaviour of the operator product

(cid:0)(cid:10)

(cid:1)

v+v− as r → 0. The form of its OPE is established in Section IX after the necessary

14

mathematical apparatus has been set up. Its proof is given there to the accuracy of the

calculation, ie up to and including terms of order g2. We shall show that the operators which

appear in its OPE are: (a) the unit operator I, with constant coeﬃcient E/3, where E is the

turbulence energy; (b) the dominant longitudinal quadratic composite operator O2(ˆx), which

gives the leading scaling behaviour; and (c) subdominant operators including all transverse

operators and the longitudinal higher order composite operators Os(ˆx). However, we shall

only be concerned with the dominant operators and so we write the expansion as

v+v− =

EI + C2(r)O2(ˆx) + . . . ,

(33)

1
3

where the dots indicate the additional subdominant terms.The scaling behaviour of this

operator product can be found in the usual way from the RG equation satisﬁed by the

leading Wilson coeﬃcient C2(r) [12].

We start by considering an arbitrary equal time correlation function of order l, given by

Hα1...αl(ˆx1, ..., ˆxl) = hvα1(ˆx1)...vαl(ˆxl)i .

(34)

If we insert (33) into this correlation function, we get

Hα1...αl(ˆx1, ..., ˆxl, ˆx +

ˆı, ˆx −

ˆı) =

Hα1...αl(ˆx1, ..., ˆxl) + C2(r)Q(2)

where, in general, Q(s)

α1...αl is the inserted correlation function deﬁned by

α1...αl (ˆx1, ..., ˆxl, ˆx) = hvα1(ˆx1)...vαl(ˆxl)Os(ˆx)i ,

and ˆı is a unit vector along the x-axis.

We can deduce the RG equation satisﬁed by the Wilson coeﬃcient C2 in (33) from (35),

given the RG equations satisﬁed by Hα1...αl and Q(2)

α1...αl. To obtain the latter, we need the

transformation rule for the equal time generator of these correlation functions, which we

denote by W (e)(J,ts).This follows in a straightforward manner by taking time independent

sources in (31), and integrating with respect to ωB and ωR, with the

J dependence, which

15

is irrelevant here, suppressed. To simplify the result, we shall anticipate the fact, which we

demonstrate in Section IV, that

We then get

ZD = Zν.

According to this relation, the bare and renormalised forms of Hα1...αl are equal. Hence,

when we change the renormalisation scale, which we denote by µ, the Fourier transform of

Hα1...αl changes according to the RG equation

where D is the standard RG operator deﬁned by

α1...αl, we obtain from (36) and (38) the relation

to allow for the fact that the expansions involve odd powers. In this case, however, it is

immediately evident that the dominant scaling must arise from the Wilson coeﬃcient of the

Here κ is the wavenumber cut-oﬀ which provides the intermediate regulation of the divergent

integrals.This is an ir wavenumber of the order of L−1, where L is the typical length scale

of the large scale ﬂow. Divergences arise in the limit κ → 0, corresponding to the inertial

range limit r/L → 0. The constants a1ν and a2ν will be calculated by eliminating the

logarithmic divergences, at 1 and 2-loop orders respectively, from the 1PI Green’s function

Γαβ(ˆk, ˆl),which is the inverse of the Fourier transform Gαβ(ˆk, ˆl) of the linear response function

We can now use ( 31) to show that the connection between the bare and renormalised forms

which demonstrates the suitability of Γ(ˆk) as a basis for determining Zν.

In carrying out the renormalisation of Γ(ˆk) to obtain the coeﬃcients in (63), we choose

the normalisation point to be ˆk = ˆm, where

Γ(ˆk) = G(ˆk)−1.

ΓR = ZνΓB,

ˆm = (m, ωm = 0).

21

Here m is a ﬁxed vector of magnitude

|m| = µ,

the direction of which need not be speciﬁed, because the geometrical factor is contained in

Pαβ(m) which cancels oﬀ. The expansion (63) is used in conjunction with a normalisation

condition that sets Γ( ˆm) equal to its tree level value. Thus, from (15) and (66), we have

Γ( ˆm) = Γ0( ˆm) = G0( ˆm)−1 = τ (µ)−1,

and so the 1-loop term satisﬁes the normalisation condition

Γ1( ˆm) = 0.

(68)

The Feynman diagram giving the 1-loop term of Γαβ( ˆm) is shown in Fig.3(i). The

standard rules apply to such diagrams with the following assignments, which are shown in

Fig.1:

4. The NS vertex with one dotted and two continuous lines represents Pαβγ(k), the ar-

gument of which is associated with the dotted leg, with k directed away from the

node.

Returning now to the 1-loop diagram for Γαβ( ˆm), we note that it has a symmetry factor

of 1. Hence, it yields a contribution to Γ1( ˆm) given by

1( ˆm) =

We can extract the logarithmic divergence from this integral by expanding its integrand in

powers of p/m. This is possible because the divergence emanates from the region p ∼ κ,

while κ ≪ µ. A simple calculation leads to

order. Here the relevant 1PI function is the correlation function given by

From this result and (31) and (66), we ﬁnd that the bare and renormalised forms of Π are

which conﬁrms that Π(ˆk) is the appropriate 1PI function to use for calculating ZD.

The normalisation condition is again chosen to be consistent with the tree level approx-

imation. That is, we set

Π( ˆm) = Π0( ˆm) = D (µ) ,

so that the 1-loop term satisﬁes the normalisation condition

Π1( ˆm) = 0.

(74)

The 1-loop Feynman diagram for Παβ( ˆm) is shown in Fig.3(ii). It has a symmetry factor

of 1/2, and makes a contribution to Π1( ˆm) which is given by

In extracting the logarithmic singularity from this integral, we must take into account the

fact that the symmetry of the integrand results in singularities of equal strength at both p ∼

we get

We shall take the equality of the 1-loop coeﬃcients of Zν and ZD as establishing that

The constant a2ν is obtained from the 2-loop term of Γαβ(ˆk), namely Pαβ(m)Γ2(ˆk). At

the normalisation point it must satisfy the condition

Therefore, from (78), we obtain the ﬁxed point coupling constant

(88)

which veriﬁes that the residual coupling can be treated as weak.

Finally, we explain why the 2-loop topologies, which have been discarded in calculating Γ,

do not contribute to a2ν.As we shall explain further in SectionVII, divergences arise in these

diagrams when it is possible for one or more soft wavevectors (ie values of p and/or q ≪ m ) to

ﬂow through a correlator.However, if this entails the ﬂow of some or all of these wavevectors

through the active (ie dotted) leg of the NS vertex, then the logarithmic divergence will be

suppressed by the extra powers of p and/or q. In the case of the 2-loop diagrams which

we have just calculated, the external hard wavevector ˆm ﬂows through the active legs of all

vertices, so no suppression occurs. However, in the case of the remaining topologies at least

one soft wavevector ﬂowing through a correlator must also ﬂow through the active leg of a NS

vertex. In the case of the four remaining two loop topologies containing vertex corrections,

the logarithmic divergence is suppressed individually for each diagram, after integration over

the solid angles. In the case of the three remaining 2-loop diagrams containing insertions of

the 1-loop diagrams (i) and (iv) of Fig.3, suppression results after integrating over the solid

angles and summing over the diagrams, the overall cancellation being related to the fact that

the coeﬃcients a1ν and a1D associated with the two types of insertion are equal. Likewise

the four 1-loop diagrams containing the counterterm vertices yield no net contribution to

a2ν. The treatment of the power and power×logarithmic divergences arising in integrals

like (71),(83) and (84) is given in Section VII. For the moment we discard them because

they are not directly relevant to the actual calculation of the scaling exponents for reasons

already given.

V. THE NONLINEAR RESPONSE

Having established that an uv ﬁxed point exists, we can proceed with the calculation

of the anomalous dimension γs of the general operator Os(ˆx), which is required for the

evaluation of the anomaly τn.To do this in the simplest possible way, we must identify a 1PI

response function which can be renormalised by means of Zs. Elimination of the logarithmic

divergences from such a function will then enable us to determine the constants in the

expansion

(89)

so that we can calculate γs using (43).

Consider ﬁrst the case s = 2. Obviously, the required function must involve O2(ˆx), which

is the composite operator associated with the longitudinal turbulence energy. In addition,

it must involve the dynamic response operator (11) in order to relate the anomaly τ2 to

the dynamics of the turbulence. This suggests that we should consider how the turbulence

energy responds on average to a change in the forcing. Clearly, we can characterise the

response of the turbulence energy at a point ˆx to a change in the forcing at two points ˆx′

and ˆx′′ by means of the nonlinear Green’s function

(cid:19)(cid:29)

(90)

But the complexity of this object is such that its logarithmic divergences cannot be summed

using the renormalisation group in terms of the Z2 and Zν counterterms alone. On the
αβ (ˆx) taken over the forcing separation ˆx′ − ˆx′′, which gives a mean

other hand, its average G

(2)

response to forcing at the centroid of the excitation points, can be, as we shall show shortly.

Hence, its corresponding 1PI function provides a direct means of obtaining the expansion

(89) and so it provides an adequate basis for the calculation of γ2.

This 1PI function is obtained as follows. We start with the Fourier transform of (90),

the reduced form of which is given by

G(2)

αβ(ˆk, ˆl, ˆp) = (2π)4δ(ˆk + ˆl + ˆp)G(2)

αβ (ˆk, ˆl),

where

G(2)

αβ (ˆk, ˆl) = Pα1 (k) Pβ1 (l) G2(ˆk, ˆl).

Its corresponding 1PI response function follows from

αβ (ˆk, ˆl, ˆp) = (2π)4δ(ˆk + ˆl + ˆp)Pα1(k)Pβ1(l)Θ(2)(ˆk, ˆl),

A standard calculation shows that it is related to G(2)

αβ by

from which, on making use of (91)-(94), we obtain

Θ(2)(ˆk, ˆl) = −Γ(ˆk)Γ(ˆl)G2(ˆk, ˆl).

This integral shows that the Fourier transform of G

αβ(ˆx) depends only on the diagonal

components of the reduced function (92). It follows, therefore, from (96) and (97), that the

1PI object which we need to consider, in order to determine Z2, is

Indeed, an application of (31), together with (67), shows that its bare and renormalised

forms are connected by

Θ(2)(ˆk, ˆk) = −Γ(ˆk)2G2(ˆk, ˆk).

Θ(2)

R (ˆk, ˆk) = Z2Θ(2)

B (ˆk, ˆk).

30

In this way, as we have indicated, we arrive at a function which can be renormalised using

the Z2 counterterm alone.

The normalisation condition for Θ(2)(ˆk, ˆk) is again applied at the point ˆk = ˆm, and

chosen to be consistent with the tree level approximation, which gives

so that the 1 and 2-loop terms satisfy the normalisation conditions

Θ(2)( ˆm, ˆm) = Θ(2)

0 ( ˆm, ˆm) = −1,

Θ(2)

1 ( ˆm, ˆm) = Θ(2)

2 ( ˆm, ˆm) = 0.

(98)

(99)

The diagrams giving Θ(2)( ˆm, ˆm) to 2-loop order are shown in Fig.4. Their new feature is

the appearance of the heavy dot vertex. This represents the O2 composite operator vertex,

which is shown in Fig.1(iv) for the general case of Os.We can understand how these diagrams

arise from the loop expansion of K by using the general procedure described in [15]. This

depends on the fact that (90) is a special case of the 4th order correlation function of

elementary ﬁelds deﬁned by

αβγδ(ˆx′, ˆx′′, ˆx, ˆz) =
B(4)

vα(ˆx′)

e
in which the arguments ˆx and ˆz coalesce. Hence, their Fourier transforms are related. In

e

particular, the connection between their respective 1PI functions is

Θ(2)

αβ(ˆk, ˆl, ˆm) =

Φαβλµ(ˆk, ˆl, ˆm − ˆq, ˆq)Gλ1( ˆm − ˆq)Gµ1(ˆq) D ˆq,

where Φ is the 1PI form corresponding to B(4), which is generated by

uγ(ˆp)iδ

.

This implies that the diagrams for Θ(2)( ˆm, ˆm) are constructed from the diagrams for Φ by

e

e

tying the two dotted external legs of the latter to form the O2 vertex.

The 1-loop diagram for Θ(2)( ˆm, ˆm) shown in Fig.4(iv) is constructed from the tree level

diagram for Φ, which is shown opposite to it in Fig.4(i). Similarly, the two 2-loop diagrams

31

for Θ(2)( ˆm, ˆm) , shown in Figs.4(v) and (vi), are constructed from the 1-loop diagrams for

Φ, again shown opposite to them in Figs.4(ii) and (iii). The other possible 2-loop diagrams

for Θ(2)( ˆm, ˆm) , which arise from the two remaining 1-loop diagrams for Φ, are discarded

because the logarithmic divergences disappear, after integration over the solid angles. In

addition, diagrams which produce longitudinal terms obviously make no contribution to Z2

and can also be discarded.

The foregoing can be generalised to arbitrary s. In place of (93), we now consider the

general 1PI response function

Θ(s)

α1...αs(ˆk1, ..., ˆks, ˆp) = (2π)4(s+1)

δs+1K
δuα1(ˆk1)...δuαs(ˆks)δts(−ˆp)

α1...αs(ˆk1, ..., ˆks, ˆp) = (2π)4δ(ˆk1 + ... + ˆks + ˆp)Pα11(k1)...Pαs1(ks)Θ(s)(ˆk1, ..., ˆks).

Then Zs can be found by eliminating the logarithmic divergences from the diagonal compo-

nent Θ(s)( ˆm, . . . , ˆm) as above. The relevant diagrams are again those shown in Figs.4(iv)-(vi),

except that the heavy dot now symbolises the Os vertex of Fig.1(iv), so the s − 2 external

legs of Os are not shown explicitly. Each diagram has a symmetry factor s(s − 1)/2. As this

is the only respect in which these diagrams diﬀer from those just considered, we have the

relation

a(s)
1,2 =

s(s − 1)
2

a(2)
1,2.

(107)

However, this is an approximate result, because it is not valid for diagrams containing more

than 2-loops. But, as we discuss further below, it suﬃces for the calculation of low order

exponents. Thus, we have now calculated all the numerical constants that we require for

the evaluation of ζn.

VI. THE SCALING EXPONENTS

For n = 2, we have, from (47),

ζ2 =

+ ∆2,

2
3

where, from (43),(48) and (89).

∆2 = −g∗(a(2)

1 + a(2)

2 g∗).

(108)

Substituting the numerical values calculated above, as given in (88),(102) and (106), we get

which yields

∆2 =

46
372 = 0.0336,

34

For n = 3, we shall verify in Section VIII that the known exact result

holds.

In the general case, for n > 3, we have from (58)

ζ2 = 0.70.

ζ3 = 1,

ζn =

− τn.

n
3

For even orders n = 2m, the anomaly is given by (59),

τn = max

τnp.

p

(109)

But, from (43),(57),(89),(107) and (108), we have

τnp = {p(p − 1) + (n − p)(n − p − 1) − 2(m − p)[(2(m − p) − 1]}

∆2
2

.

A simple calculation shows that the maximum value of this expression is attained by the

two terms in the series (52) with (a) p = m and (b) p = m − 1; which gives for (109)

τn = m(m − 1)∆2.

(110)

For odd orders, n = 2m + 1, the anomaly is given directly by (60), which yields

where we have again used (43),(89),(107) and (108).

The above results have been used to calculate ζn up to n = 10. The results are shown

in Fig.5, together with the experimental data taken from [16-20]. It can be seen that the

agreement is good up to about n = 7 and fair beyond, if we allow for the uncertainties in

the experimental data which begin to arise.

In particular, it may be noted that the key

values ζ2 = 0.70 and ζ6 = 1.8 are in good agreement with experimental data, the respective

data sets from [16-20] giving for ζ2 the values (0.71, 0.70, 0.71, 0.70, 0.71) and for ζ6 the

τn = m2∆2,

35

values (1.78, 1.8, 1.8, 1.71, 1.71). The divergence of the experimental data at higher orders

reﬂects the fact that the experimental determination of ζn is not yet fully satisfactory for the

reasons given in [20]. Hence, the good agreement between our calculations at higher values

of n with the particular data sets from [16-18] must be treated with caution, particularly

as the expression we have derived above is not applicable at large orders. This limitation

stems from the fact that the mean nonlinear response function, being an average over the

forcing conﬁguration, does not represent the eﬀect of multiple correlations with suﬃcient

accuracy at large n. In addition, the approximation (107), as we have noted, only holds

up to 2-loop order. Indeed, it is evident from the foregoing that the overall approximation

must fail when ng∗ ∼ 1. However, this occurs at roughly n = 20, which is well above the

current limit of reliable experimental data. Equally, the divergence of our theoretical values

at higher values of n from the other two data sets [19,20] could indicate that the accuracy

of our low order approximation is already beginning to deteriorate at around n ∼ 10.

VII. ELIMINATION OF SWEEPING

We now return to the question of the power and power×logarithmic divergences which,

up to this point, we have simply discarded. The fact that power divergences arise when

ﬁeld-theoretic methods are applied to turbulence, using an Eulerian approach, was noticed

originally in [21]. Their origin was subsequently identiﬁed as being due to the kinematic eﬀect

of the sweeping of small eddies by large eddies, having an almost uniform velocity [22,23].

The remedy was to change from an Eulerian to a Lagrangian description, but this greatly

complicates the subsequent analysis [24]. However, it has been shown that the elimination

of sweeping can be accomplished more simply by transforming to a frame moving with the

local velocity of the large scale eddies at some chosen reference point, [25,26]. We shall

show that a similar approach can be used to eliminate the power and power×logarithmic

divergences within the present framework. In this way, we shall demonstrate that, although

we have started out from an Eulerian formulation, we ultimately obtain quasi-Lagrangian

36

approximations for the renormalised functions.

The problem, therefore, is to ﬁnd a sweeping interaction term, ∆Ls, say, which can be

used to eliminate the eﬀect of sweeping convection. To this end, we introduce a uniform

convection U into W and average over its probability distribution, which we assume to be a

Gaussian distribution ∝ exp(−U 2/2U 2

0 ).This adds to L an additional interaction term given

by

∆LU = −

l · m

v( ˆm) · v(− ˆm)

v(ˆl) · v( − ˆl) DˆlD ˆm,

(111)

U 2
0
2

Z

which represents the eﬀect of a random Galilean transformation of the velocity ﬁeld. We

e

e

have not distinguished between v before and after the transformation for consistency with

the earlier expressions, such as (18), and bearing in mind that the transformation does not

aﬀect the statistical averages required for the structure functions.

To represent diagrammatically the additional terms which arise in the loop expansion

of W after the inclusion of the sweeping interaction term we need to introduce a new 4-leg

‘sweeping’ vertex of the type shown in Fig.6(i). The two wavevectors ˆl and ˆm in (111)

enter this vertex along its continuous legs and leave along the dotted legs. A pair of legs

carrying a particular wavevector must also carry the same vector index to represent the

scalar product. Free wavevectors in a diagram containing one or more of these sweeping

vertices are identiﬁed, as previously, by overall wavenumber conservation, together with

conservation at any NS vertex. Each sweeping vertex then contributes a factor U 2

0 l · m,

where l and m are the two wavevectors which enter the vertex along its two continuous legs.

In all other respects the diagrams are to be interpreted in accordance with the rules given

in Section IV.

Consider now the set of diagrams, containing only NS vertices, which are associated

with a particular Green’s function or velocity correlator, G, say. Let CN S denote any such

diagram contributing to G. We shall show that it is possible to generate all power and

power×logarithmic divergences of any CN S from a single sweeping interaction of the form

(111). Let CU denote any diagram containing at least one sweeping vertex. If CU contains

37

no NS vertices at all, then it will only generate power divergences. But if it contains

at least one NS vertex, it will also generate power×logarithmic divergences.The following

topological argument demonstrates that the power divergences of CN S can be put into 1-1

correspondence with the CU diagrams relating to G.

Each factor τ (κ) (or, equivalently, ε−1) in a power divergence of CN S arises because it

is possible for a soft wavevector q to ﬂow through a particular velocity correlator without

ﬂowing through the active legs of the two NS vertices which it connects, as already discussed

in Section IV. This situation can be represented diagrammatically by contracting the corre-

lator into a 4-leg vertex formed by merging the two NS vertices which it links, whilst leaving

the hard lines in tact. This can be demonstrated as follows. First, the new vertex must

consist of two in-coming full lines which carry hard wavevectors, l and m (say), and two

outgoing dotted lines along which they leave.This is because two full legs disappear from the

merged NS vertices and wavevectors leave NS vertices along the dotted leg. Furthermore,

after integrating over the directions of the soft wavevector q, the two merged NS vertices

generate, through contraction of the projectors, a factor proportional to the scalar product

of the in-coming hard lines, l · m, while the two legs of a pair carrying the same wavevector

acquire the same vector index.The ﬁnal integration over the wavenumbers then produces

the constant

given by

So, such a vertex must, in fact, be of the sweeping convection type (111), with a coeﬃcient

U 2

0 =

gτ (κ)ν3,

3
2

(112)

which relates the rms velocity of the sweeping eddies to the strength of the nonlinear inter-

action.Note that U0 is scale dependent, as it depends on the renormalisation scale µ through

g and ν, and, hence, it diﬀers according to the ﬂuctuation scale on which the RG focuses.

In physical terms, this reﬂects the fact that the rms velocity of the sweeping eddies depends

38

on the scale selected.

Clearly, if a subset of correlators of CN S, each of which carries a soft wavenumber, is

contracted into such vertices, in a manner which allows hard wavevectors to ﬂow through

CN S, then the result is a diagram which is identical to one of the CU diagrams. Moreover,

it is clear that there are always exactly as many ways to contract the correlators in CN S as

there are diﬀerent CU diagrams and that their symmetry factors must match. This argument

demonstrates, therefore, the important point that the power and power×logarithmic diver-

gences generated by the NS vertex must arise on account of the background of kinematic

sweeping eﬀects. Moreover, we also see that, in order to eliminate them, it is only necessary

to introduce a sweeping interaction term into W of opposite sign to the one from which they

can be generated, which, according to (111) and (112) yields the sweeping interaction term

∆Ls =

(113)

Thus, the sweeping vertex shown in Fig.6(i) is taken to represent the algebraic factor

e

e

Vertex 6(i) = −

gτ (k)ν3 l · m.

3
2

Having inserted (113) into W one is then left with only the pure logarithmic divergences

generated by the NS vertex, which, as we have shown, can be summed using the RG. This

justiﬁes our procedure whereby power and power×logarithmic divergences are discarded

when calculating anomalous exponents.

We now illustrate the cancellation of power and power×logarithmic divergences in con-

crete terms by eliminating them to 2-loop order from Γ(ˆk). This will demonstrate how the

various symmetry factors match up. Consider ﬁrst the 1-loop diagram for Γ1(ˆk) arising from

the NS vertex. From our previous result (70), we ﬁnd that its power divergence is given, at

the normalisation point, by

Γ1(diagram 3(i)) =

3
2

g

τ (κ)
τ (µ)2 .

(114)

Here the Feynman rules applied to the sweeping vertex yield the single diagram of Fig.6(ii),

39

as we anticipate from the fact that the NS vertices in Fig.3(i) can be merged in only one

way. In this case, a trivial calculation yields

Γ1(diagram 6(ii)) = −

g

3
2

τ (κ)
τ (µ)2 ,

which cancels (114), as required.

Explicit veriﬁcation that there are no power or power×logarithmic divergences in Γ(ˆk)

at 2-loop order is less trivial. Consider ﬁrst diagram (iv) of Fig.3. The power divergences

arising from this diagram follow from (82) which gives

Γ2(diagram 3(iv) = −

(cid:27)

(115)

For this diagram the corresponding sweeping diagrams are diagrams (i)-(iii) of Fig.7. This

follows from the Feynman rules and can be checked from diagram (iv) of Fig.3 by ﬁrst

contracting its correlators individually and then together. By applying the Feynman rules

to diagram (i) of Fig.7 we obtain, at the normalisation point,

Pαβ(m)Γ2 (diagram 7(i)) =

(cid:27)

Diagram (ii) of Fig.7 yields the same value

Γ2(diagram 7(iii)) = −

g2

40

Evidently, the sum of these three diagrams cancels (115) exactly.

Similarly, we can show that the sweeping vertex eliminates the power divergences arising

from the second 2-loop diagram, shown in Fig.3(iii). From (81), these are given by

Γ2(diagram 3(iii)) = −

(cid:27)

Again, their sum exactly cancels (116). We have thereby veriﬁed to 2-loop order that the

sweeping interaction eliminates power divergences from the linear response function.

VIII. THE KOLMOGOROV APPROXIMATION

The fact that it has been possible to calculate the anomalies successfully by means of

perturbation theory stems, in part, from the incorporation of the Kolmogorov theory into

the zero order approximation. As we have seen, this has been done by replacing the actual

viscous quadratic form in W , arising from the NS equations, by a modiﬁed quadratic form,

characterised by an eﬀective random stirring force spectrum D(k) and the eﬀective timescale

τ (k).We now demonstrate that these two functions can be deduced self-consistently as part

of the calculation and conﬁrm that that they do have the inertial range forms given in (24)

and (25).

To determine these functions, we need two conditions. As in [10], one condition is

supplied by evaluating the energy equation to 1-loop order, which gives the convergent DIA

41

form, corresponding to the so-called line renormalisation [24]. In the inertial range, it reduces

to the condition that the energy ﬂux across wavenumbers ΠE(k) is independent of k and

equal to the mean dissipation rate ǫ:

Thus, evaluation of ΠE(k) to 1-loop order gives the well-known result [24]

ΠE(k) = ǫ.

ΠE(k) =

(117)

Here ∆ indicates integration over the region of the p, q plane in which p, q, r can form a

b(p, q, r) =

(p2 + q2 − r2)3

.

The second condition must be deduced from the linear response function.This is where

diﬃculties have arisen with this approach in the past, when using an Eulerian framework,

because of the ir divergences arising from sweeping. On the other hand, it is known that no

divergence problems arise from sweeping convection in the case of the energy equation [24].

However, we have just shown how these power divergences can be systematically removed

from the response function (and, indeed, all such functions) by means of a random Galilean

transformation of the velocity ﬁeld. This leaves the logarithmic divergences which, as we

have seen, are to be eliminated from Γ(ˆk) using the Zν counterterm. Recall that to ﬁx the

ﬁnite part of Γ(ˆk), after this renormalisation, we imposed the normalisation condition (68)

which speciﬁes that its tree level term should be exact at the normalisation scale µ.Thus,

after eliminating sweeping convection, as described in Section VII, and using the 1-loop

42

normalisation condition (68) to eliminate the logarithmic divergences, we obtain, at an

arbitrary wavevector k (with ω = 0), the renormalised linear response function

It is precisely the condition that this expression should, indeed, yield a ﬁnite renormalised

value which provides the required second relation, as we now explain.

In the inertial range limit, we seek scaling solutions with τ (k) ∝ k−a and Q(k) ∝ kb, in

which case D(k) = τ (k)−1Q(k) ∝ ka+b. Now standard dimensional analysis shows that for

(117) to hold in these circumstances, we must have a + 2b = −8, [24]. Furthermore, if this

scaling solution were to produce a non-renormalisable divergence in the response function,

it would arise in the second term of (118), since we can assume that a > 0. To prevent this

from occurring, the coeﬃcient of the integral must be zero, which requires

(cid:16)
giving a = 2/3, and, hence, b = −11/3, so that a + b = −3.Thus, these relations do, in fact,

(cid:17)

yield the solution (24) and (25), which we may conveniently re-write as

τ (k)

Therefore, the energy spectrum function

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

For present purposes, explicit evaluation of the two constants is unnecessary, since they

ultimately disappear from the calculation of the exponents, because they only occur through

the coupling constant which, as we have seen, is eventually evaluated in terms of its ﬁxed

point value.

Next, we comment brieﬂy on the eﬀect of allowing for the perturbation terms (23) which

give the diﬀerence between the modiﬁed quadratic form and the original viscous form. As

in [10], we treat these terms as being of nominal order g. Their eﬀect is, ﬁrstly, to re-

introduce into Γ(ˆk) the viscous timescale τν (k) which was replaced by τ0(k). Secondly, and

more signiﬁcantly, new divergences appear. However, it is not diﬃcult to show that the

divergent terms which are independent of h(k) and ν sum exactly to the amount cancelled

by the counterterms, as would be expected. In the inertial range limit ν → 0, this leaves

the term arising from h(k),which is given by

Given that the actual stirring force spectrum function h(k) has remained arbitrary, subject

only to the condition that it yields a ﬁnite input power given by

∆Γ = −

it is clear that the above integral for ∆Γ must be ﬁnite.

Thus, the role of these perturbation terms is not critical as regards calculating the

anomalous exponents, provided that the the spectrum of the stirring forces is non-zero

only at small k, as it should be. However, what we ﬁnd is that, although forced at large

scales, the above solution behaves in the inertial range as if the ﬂuid were stirred with a

force spectral function ∝ k−3.

In this context, it is interesting to note that, in a study

of the randomly forced NS equations by a stochastic force with zero mean and variance

44

∝ k−3 [27], evidence of multiscaling of the structure functions has been found. In particular,

the results obtained for the ratios ζn/ζ2 with the k−3 spectrum have been shown to agree

with the values computed from the NS equations forced at large scales. This, of course, is

exactly what one might expect from the above approximation.The present results are also

consistent with the numerical calculations in [28], which suggest the scaling τL(k) ∝ k−2/3,
as in (119), for the Lagrangian micro timescale, as opposed to the scaling τE(k) ∝ k−1 for

the Eulerian micro timescale, evidence for which has also been presented in [29]. As we

have seen, the reason why the Lagrangian timescale applies in the present calculation is

because we have eliminated sweeping by referring the velocity ﬁeld to a frame moving with

the local velocity of the large scale eddies which prevail at any chosen scale. This extracts

the straining interactions, which shape the spectrum, from the background of convection,

to yield quasi-Lagrangian approximations.

In a sense, this derivation of the Kolmogorov quadratic form is analogous to a multiple

timescale expansion in nonlinear wave theory, where part of the nonlinear behaviour is

incorporated into the linear approximation, eg via a slowly changing wave amplitude, the

variation of which is then determined from the nonlinear interaction by requiring the absence

of secular terms in the higher order approximation.Here the requirement is similar in that

it demands the absence of non-renormalisable terms in order to determine the nonlinear

behaviour of the modiﬁed quadratic form.

An integral part of the Kolmogorov theory is the exact result that in the inertial range

S3(r) = 6B111(r, 0, 0).

This latter integral is, of course, the transport power ΠE(κ), which is a ﬁnite quantity at

recover (121).

The correlation function B111(x) also has an important role in the derivation of the OPEs

required for the structure functions with higher odd orders, as we shall see shortly.

IX. DERIVATION OF THE OPES

We give ﬁnally the derivation of the dominant terms of the OPEs which we have used in

Section III to obtain the structure function expansions. We deal ﬁrst with the expansions

46

required for the higher order structure functions with orders n > 3. These can be obtained

using the technique described in [30]. We defer discussion of the particular case n = 2 until

last, because it requires a diﬀerent approach for the reasons given in Section III.

We begin by considering the OPE of the general product, deﬁned in (49), as it appears in

the expansion (50) for Sn(r), taking ﬁrst the case of even orders n = 2m, with p = 0, 1, . . . , m,

namely

Λn−p,p(ˆx, r) =

vn−p
+ vp
p!(n − p)!

−

,

where, as previously, v± = v1(x ± r/2, y, z, t), and we have used the deﬁnition (9). Let us

consider the eﬀect of inserting Λn−p,p into a correlation function containing an arbitrary set

of elementary ﬁelds vα1(ˆx), . . . , vαl(ˆxl), as in (34). Then, following the approach of [30], we

can derive the dominant terms which we have used in Section III by considering how many

of the v+ ﬁelds can be paired with a v− ﬁeld to form products of lower order correlation

functions.

Consider the case p = m, ie

hvα1(ˆx1) . . . vαl(ˆxl)Λm,m(ˆx, r)i.

Here each v+ can be paired with a v− to yield a product term

h(v+v−)mi hvα1(ˆx1) . . . vαl(ˆxl)i ,

(123)

which corresponds to the presence of a unit operator term in the OPE, [30]. If, instead, we

only select m − 1 pairs of v+v− products, we obtain a term of the type

2

(v+v−)m−1

vα1(ˆx1) . . . vαl(ˆxl)

.

v2
+
2

(cid:18)

(cid:19)(cid:29)

(cid:10)

(cid:28)

(cid:11)

Now, in the limit as r → 0, v2

+/2 behaves like an insertion of O2(ˆx) into the correlation

function of elementary ﬁelds [30]. Hence, this product tends to

2

(v+v−)m−1

hvα1(ˆx1) . . . vαl(ˆxl)O2(ˆx)i .

(124)

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

47

But the averages of powers of v+v− simply yield non-stochastic functions of r, which we

shall denote generically by C0(r), C2(r), . . . , as appropriate. Thus, from (123) and (124), we

obtain, in the limit as r → 0,

hvα1(ˆx1) . . . vαl(ˆxl)Λm,m(ˆx, r)i = hvα1(ˆx1) . . . vαl(ˆxl) [C0(r) + C2(r)O2(ˆx) + . . .]i .

Since the elementary ﬁelds are arbitrary, it follows that we have an OPE of the form

Λm,m(ˆx, r) = C0(r)I + C2(r)O2(ˆx) + . . . .

The point about expansions of this type is that the operators of increasing complexity do,

indeed, produce subdominant terms in the expansion of Sn(r). Here, for example, the unit

operator term, as we have shown, produces the dominant scaling with anomalous exponent

given by (110), whereas the quadratic term can be readily shown to give the smaller exponent

τn = [m(m − 1) − 1]∆2, and, hence, is subdominant, while further terms in the expansion

would produce even greater reductions.

A similar argument applies when p = m − 1. In this case, however, we cannot pair every

v+ with a v−. Therefore, the unit operator term cannot appear in the OPE for Λm+1,m−1. If,

however, we pair every v− with a v+ then the remaining v2

+ pairs with the elementary ﬁelds

and, in the limit as r → 0, again appears as an O2(ˆx) insertion. In this case, therefore, the

OPE starts with O2(ˆx) to give

Λm+1,m−1(ˆx, r) = C2(r)O2(ˆx) + . . . .

By continuing with this argument, we see that the dominant term of the OPE for the general

case of Λn−p,p must take the form given in (51).

Consider next odd orders, n = 2m + 1. When p = m, we have a term of the form

v2
+v−

h(v+v−)mi hvα1(ˆx1) . . . vαl (ˆxl)i ,

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

which, again, corresponds to the presence of a unit operator term, which is, thus, the

dominant term of the OPE, giving

48

When p = m − 1, by pairing each v− with a v+, we obtain a term of the form

Λm+1,m(ˆx, r) = C0(r)I + . . . .

(v+v−)m−1

vα1 (ˆx1) . . . vαl (ˆxl) v3
+

.

(cid:10)

(cid:11) (cid:10)

(cid:11)

In the limit as r → 0, v3

+ appears as an insertion of the cubic operator O3(ˆx), so that here

the OPE takes the form

Λm+2,m−1(ˆx, r) = C3(r)O3(ˆx) + . . . .

Continuing this process, we get for the next OPE

Λm+3,m−2(ˆx, r) = C5(r)O5(ˆx) + . . . ,

and so on. But, in fact, the only term which contributes to Sn(r) for odd n is the unit oper-

ator term of Λm+1,m because hO2s+1(ˆx)i = 0 for any integer s, in the case of homogeneous

In the particular case of v+v−, we can establish the form of its OPE by using an expansion

in the Fourier domain, in which the wavenumber q, corresponding to the separation r, tends

to inﬁnity, as described for instance, in [7,8]. To this end, we start by considering the general

isotropic turbulence.

Hαβλµ(ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx′, ˆx′′) = hvα (ˆx1) vβ (ˆx2) vλ (ˆx′) vµ (ˆx′′)i ,

for the case in which ˆx′ and ˆx′′ tend to a common point ˆx, well separated from ˆx1 and ˆx2.

For simplicity of presentation here, we have included only two arbitrary ﬁelds vα(ˆx1) and

vβ(ˆx2).Denote its Fourier transform by

Hαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆk, ˆk′) =

vα (ˆp) vβ (ˆp′) vλ(ˆk)vµ(ˆk′)

(125)

Then, in terms of the reduced correlation function, we can write

49

Hαβλµ(ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx′, ˆx′′) =

When the arguments in (125) coalesce to the common point ˆx, we obtain the correlation

with Fourier transform

Qαβλµ(ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx) = hvα (ˆx1) vβ (ˆx2) vλ (ˆx) vµ (ˆx)i ,

Qαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′

= (2π)4 δ(ˆp + ˆp′ + ˆq) ˜Qαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆq).

Thus, corresponding to (126), we have

Qαβλµ(ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx) =

D ˆpD ˆp′Qαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | −ˆp − ˆp′) exp {iˆp · (ˆx1 − ˆx) + iˆp · (ˆx2 − ˆx)} .

Z

Let Ψαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆk, ˆk′) and Ξαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆq) be the 1PI functions associated with the
connected parts of ˜Hαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆk, ˆk′) and ˜Q(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆq). Denoting the connected part by

superscript c, we have, as in Section V,

˜H (c)

αβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆk, ˆk′) = −Gαα′ (ˆp) Gββ′ (ˆp′) Gλλ′(ˆk)Gµµ′(ˆk′)Ψα′β′λ′µ′(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆk, ˆk′),

(127)

and

˜Q(c)

αβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆq) = −Gαα′(ˆp)Gββ′(ˆp′)Ξα′β′λµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆq).

(128)

According to the standard procedure [7,8], the behaviour of the correlation function

Hαβλµ(ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx′, ˆx′′) as a function of ˆx′ − ˆx′′, when ˆx′ and ˆx′′ both tend to a common value
ˆx, can be deduced from the behaviour of Ψαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | ˆq − (ˆp + ˆp′)/2, −ˆq − (ˆp + ˆp′)/2), in

the limit as ˆq → ∞, which is, indeed, apparent from (126) and (127). Now, the diagrams

which contribute to this 1PI correlation function are diagram (i) of Fig.8, together with

its permutation (ˆp, α) ↔ (ˆp′, β), and diagram (ii). However, it is easy to see from these

50

diagrams that, as ˆq → ∞, diagram (ii) yields a contribution which is smaller than that from

diagram (i) by a factor Qσν(ˆq) ∼ q−11/3. So to derive the dominant term, we need to focus
on diagram (i) and its permutation. The corresponding diagrams for Ξαβλµ(ˆp, ˆp′ | −ˆp − ˆp′)

are diagram (iii) of Fig.8 plus its permutation λ ↔ µ.

Evaluation of these diagrams using the Feynman rules is straightforward and yields

To obtain the required expansion for v+v−, we must take the inverse Fourier transform

of (129) for the particular case λ = µ = 1 with

We now deﬁne Q(L)

αβ (ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx) to be the connected correlation function formed from the

elementary ﬁelds vα(ˆx1) and vβ(ˆx2), with the insertion of the longitudinal energy operator

O2(ˆx), ie it is the particular case of (36) with s = 2 and l = 2. Then

Q(c)

αβ11(ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx) = 2Q(L)

αβ (ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx).

Similarly, we deﬁne Q(T )

αβ (ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx) to be the correlation function with vα(ˆx1) and vβ(ˆx2),

and the insertion of the transverse energy operator

αβ33(ˆx1, ˆx2 | ˆx) = 2Q(T )

Note that we have discarded the transverse operator because it is subdominant. This follows

immediately from the analysis of Section V. For example, in the case of O(T )

, when we

calculate the corresponding value of the constant a(2)

1 , as deﬁned in (89), we get twice the

value given in (102) for the longitudinal operator O2(ˆx), because, by isotropy, each of the

two transverse components of O(T )

2

(ˆx) contributes an amount equal to the value obtained for

O2(ˆx) and, hence, the right hand side of (108) then yields an anomalous exponent of 2∆2,

indicating that O(T )

2

(ˆx) makes a subdominant contribution to S2(r). Thus, we have shown,

to within the order g2 of the calculation, that the dominant term of the OPE for v+v− has

the form given in (33).

X. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The fact that it has been possible to demonstrate multiscaling and calculate anoma-

lous exponents successfully from the generating functional by means of perturbation theory,

notwithstanding the strong nonlinearity of the NS equations, is attributable to several fac-

tors.These include: (1) the use of a modiﬁed quadratic form, which is derived self-consistently

from the NS nonlinearity;(2) the incorporation in the generating functional of the composite

operators which appear in the deﬁnition of the general structure function;(3) the application

of OPEs to derive corrections to the Kolmogorov exponents in terms of the anomalous di-

mensions of these operators;(4) the identiﬁcation of a class of irreducible Green’s functions

containing insertions of these operators, which facilitate the calculation of their anomalous

dimensions;(5) the elimination of sweeping convection eﬀects using a random Galilean trans-

formation of the velocity ﬁeld; and, ﬁnally, (6) the deduction of the inertial range scaling

using an uv ﬁxed point of the RG to achieve the required small wavenumber limit. Let us

now consider how each of these factors contributes to overcoming the obstacles encountered

in previous applications of the RG.

53

The use of the modiﬁed quadratic form is an important element in the success of our cal-

culation, because it provides an accurate initial approximation, which yields the Kolmogorov

distribution in the inertial range limit. By contrast, in the early work which employed a ﬁeld

theoretic RG [31], and in subsequent developments of it [32-34], including equivalent formu-

lations based on [35], reviewed recently in [36], the zero order approximation is based solely

on on the linear terms of the NS equations, as in a conventional ﬁeld theory calculation.

Because this is a poor approximation for turbulence, it does not result in a genuine weak

expansion parameter. For example, in the previous applications of RG techniques based on

an expansion in the force spectrum exponent (ie the ǫ-expansion), in which the expansion

about ǫ = 0 is extrapolated to ǫ = 4, the value of the coupling constant is not small, at

the ir ﬁxed point which is used. Therefore, the accuracy of the expansion is uncontrolled.

Indeed, according to[37], it may even be uncontrolled when ǫ ≪ 1, and there are problems in

establishing its radius of convergence and the value of ǫ at which long range driving becomes

technically irrelevant [38].

However, our expansion is of a diﬀerent nature. First, we do not use an ǫ-expansion.

Actually, there is no force power spectrum in our calculation as such.As we showed, the

force spectrum h(k) remains in the calculation as an arbitrary function, subject only to the

requirment that it yields a ﬁnite input power. What the modiﬁed quadratic form provides,

however, is an apparent force power spectrum D(k), but its exponent is ﬁxed by the solution

(120), and, thus, cannot be varied. Second, we do not use an ir ﬁxed point, because we are

interested in taking the short wavelength limit, for which purpose we require an uv ﬁxed

point.Together, these diﬀerences result in a genuinely small coupling constant g, which is

about 1/20 at the ﬁxed point, as shown in Section IV. Hence, our expansion is inherently

more accurate than the ǫ-expansion. In fact, given that our calculation is carried out to

2-loop order, its errors are controlled at g3 ∼ 10−4. Another signiﬁcant consequence of using

the modiﬁed quadratic form is that no convergence problems are encountered in the uv

region. This, together with the fact that we do not use an ǫ-expansion or an ir ﬁxed point,

means that none of the ingredients which cause marginality by power counting in previous

54

applications of the RG [37], are present in our approach.

On the other hand, there is a similar problem to be faced in the present calculation.Any

fully renormalised theory of turbulence must contain an inﬁnite number of renormalised

functions because it must be equivalent to the hierarchy of equations for the cumulants.This

equivalence has been demonstrated recently [39]. In fact, each cumulant will have a repre-

sentation as a expansion in terms of irreducible renormalised functions. Thus, one has an

inﬁnite set of vertex functions to contend with. Now, when any one of these irreducible

functions is calculated in perturbation theory using the modiﬁed quadratic form, the overall

logarithmic divergence will remain, after sweeping divergences have been eliminated. So the

problem in the present approach amounts to the resummation of these logarithms. However,

we showed in Section V that this diﬃculty could be overcome, in relation to multiscaling, by

identifying the inﬁnite sub-class of functions which yields the desired information relating

to anomalous exponents while being, at the same time, amenable to resummation using the

RG.The irreducible inserted nonlinear Green’s functions deﬁned in Section V satisfy both

requirements. Being fully irreducible they give full n-point correlations.However, as we have

seen, to render them tractable, it was expedient to obtain a mean response to forcing at the

centroid of the excitation points. This averaging thus constitutes a closure approximation.

Although this type of closure approximation permits considerable progress to be made with

the calculation of the exponents, the averaging process limits its applicability to relatively

low orders, n . 10, because the multiple correlations between the apparent forcing at diﬀer-

ent space-time points are not then approximated accurately enough at higher orders. Thus,

a diﬀerent approximation would be required to obtain the asymptotic scaling at large orders

and it remains for future work to discover a suitable approach.

We report results of sumulation of wave turbulence. Both inverse and direct cascades are observed. The
deﬁnition of ”mesoscopic turbulence” is given. This is a regime when number of modes in a system involved in
turbulence is high enough to qualitatively simulate most of processes but signiﬁcantly smaller then threshold
which gives us quantitative agreement with statistical description, like kinetic equation. Such regime takes
place in numerical simulation, essentially ﬁnite systems etc.

Theory of wave turbulence is developed for inﬁnitely
large system. In weakly nonlinear dispersive media the
turbulence is described by a kinetic equation for squared
wave amplitudes (weak turbulence). However, all real
systems are ﬁnite. Computer simulation of wave turbu-
lence also can be done only in ﬁnite system (typically
in a box with periodic boundary conditions). It is im-
portant to know how strong discreteness of a system
impacts the physical picture of wave turbulence.

Let a turbulence be realized in D-dimensional cube
with side L. Then wave vectors form a cubic lattice with
the lattice constant ∆k = 2π/L. Suppose that four-
wave resonant conditions are dominating. Exact reso-
nances satisfy the equations

In a ﬁnite system (1), (2) are Diophantine equations
which might have or have no exact solutions. The Dio-
phantine equation for four-wave resonant processes are
not studied yet. For three-wave resonant processes they
are studied for Rossby waves on β-plane [1].

However, not only exact resonances are important.
Individual harmonics in the wave ensemble ﬂuctuate
with inverse time Γk, dependent on their wave numbers.
Suppose that all Γki for waves, composing a resonant

Three diﬀerent cases are possible

≫

In this case the resonant layer is thick enough to
hold many approximate resonant quartets on a
unit of resonant surface square. These resonances
are dense, and the theory is close to the classi-
cal weak turbulent theory in inﬁnite media. The
weak turbulent theory oﬀers recipes for calcula-
tion of Γk. The weak-turbulent Γk are the small-
est among all given by theoretical models. To be
sure that the case is realized, one has to use weak-
turbulent formulae for Γk.

This is the opposite case. Resonances are rareﬁed,
and the system consists of a discrete set of weakly
interacting oscillators. A typical regime in this
situation is the ”frozen turbulence” [2], [3], [4],
which is actually a system of KAM tori, accom-
plished with a weak Arnold’s diﬀusion.

≃

3. The intermediate case δk

∆k can be called
”mesoscopic turbulence”. A density of approx-
imate resonances is high enough to provide the
energy transport along the spectrum, but low
enough to guarantee ”equal rights” for all harmon-
ics, which is necessary condition for applicability
of the weak turbulent theory.

In this article we report results of our numerical ex-
periments on modeling of turbulence of gravity waves
on the surface of deep ideal incompressible ﬂuid. The
motivation of this work was numerical justiﬁcation of

Hasselmann kinetic equation. The result is discovery of
the mesoscopic turbulence. The ﬂuid motion is poten-
tial and described by shape of surface η(r, t) and veloc-
ity potential ψ(r, t), evaluated on the surface. These
variables satisfy the canonical equations [5]

With the time step τ this calculations took about two
months on AMD Athlon 64 3500+. During this time we
reached 1500 periods of the wave in the initial spectral
maximum.

The process of waves evolution can be separated in
two steps. On the ﬁrst stage (about ﬁfty initial wave
periods) we observe fast loss of energy and wave action.
This eﬀect can be explained by formation of ”slave” har-
monics, taking their part of motion constants. Initially
smooth spectrum becomes very rough. The spectral
maximum demonstrates fast downshift.

On the second stage the downshift continues, but
all processes slow down. Plots of energy, wave action,
mean frequency and mean steepness are presented on
Fig. 1-4.
One can see clear tendency to downshift
of spectral maximum corresponding to inverse cascade,
however this process is more slow then predicted by
weak turbulence theory. Self-similar downshift in this
theory gives [12], [13]

On the same ﬁgure we can see the most remarkable fea-

The weak turbulence in the ﬁrst approximation
obeys the Gaussian statistics. Neighbour harmonics are
uncorrelated and statistically independent (

0). However their averaged characteristics are close to
each other. This is a ”democratic society”. On the con-
trary mesoscopic turbulence is the ”oligarchic society”.
The Phillips curve (11) has a genus 2. After Faltings’

Classiﬁcation of these solutions is a hard problem of the
number theory. These solutions compose the ”elite soci-
ety” of the harmonics, which play the most active role in
the mesoscopic turbulence. Almost all inverse cascade
of wave action is realized within members of this ”priv-
ileged club”. The distribution of harmonics exceeding a
2 = 10−11 at the moment t = 1200T0
reference level
is presented on Fig. 11. A number of such harmonics is
not more than 600, while a total number of harmonics
involved into the turbulence is of the order of 104.

Note that a situation with direct cascade is diﬀer-
ent. As far as the coupling coeﬃcient for gravity waves
growth as fast as k3 with wave number, for short waves
Γk/ωk easily exceeds ∆k/k, and conditions of applica-
bility of the weak turbulent theory for short waves are
satisﬁed.

Note also that the mesoscopic turbulence is not a
numerical artefact. Simple estimations show that for
gravity waves it is realized in some conditions in basins
of a moderate size, like small lakes as well as in experi-
mental wave tanks. It is also common for long internal
waves in ocean and for inertial gravity waves in atmo-
sphere, for plasma waves in tokamaks etc.

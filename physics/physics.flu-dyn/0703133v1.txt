Dynamical Eﬀects and Phase Separation in Thin Films

(Dated: December 19, 2013)

We study phase separation in thin ﬁlms using the Navier–Stokes Cahn–Hilliard equations in the
lubrication approximation, modeling substrate-ﬁlm interactions with a van der Waals potential. We
investigate the thin-ﬁlm equations numerically and compare them with experimental results. We
ﬁnd that the model captures the qualitative features of real phase-separating ﬂuids, in particular the
tendency of concentration gradients to produce ﬁlm thinning and surface roughening. The ultimate
outcome of the phase separation depends strongly on the dynamical backreaction of concentration
gradients on the ﬂow, as we demonstrate when a shear stress is applied at the ﬁlm’s surface. When
the backreaction is small, the phase domain boundaries align with the direction of the imposed
stress, while as the backreaction is made larger, the domains begin to align in the perpendicular
direction.

When a binary ﬂuid is cooled below the critical tem-
perature, the homogeneous state is energetically un-
favourable and the system spontaneously phase-separates
and forms domains rich in either ﬂuid component [1, 2].
Due to the relevance of phase-separating thin ﬁlms in in-
dustrial applications [3], many experiments and numeri-
cal simulations focus on understanding how phase sepa-
ration is altered if the binary ﬂuid is conﬁned in a thin
layer. We propose a lubrication approximation based
on the coupled Navier–Stokes Cahn–Hilliard equations
to explain the main features of these studies.

Several recent experiments have clariﬁed the diﬀerent
regimes of domain growth in a binary thin ﬁlm. Wang
and Composto [4] have identiﬁed early, intermediate, and
late stages of evolution. The early stage comprises three-
dimensional domain growth, while the intermediate stage
is characterized by the formation of wetting layers at the
ﬁlm boundaries, the thinning of the middle layer, and
signiﬁcant surface roughening. Due to the thinning of
the middle layer, the sandwich-like structure breaks up
and matter from the wetting layer ﬂows back into the
bulk. Thus, a late stage is reached, consisting of bubbles
coated by thin wetting layers. This characterization of
the evolution has been seen in other experiments [5, 6],
although clearly a variety of behaviors is possible, de-
pending on the wetting properties of tnhe mixture. Our
model captures the essential features of this evolution,
in particular the tendency for concentration gradients to
promote ﬁlm rupture and surface roughening.

In a series of papers, Das et al. [7, 8] investigate the
behaviour of binary ﬂuids with wetting. In [7] they spe-
cialize to ultra-thin ﬁlms. In bulk mixtures, where one
of the ﬂuid components is preferentially attracted to the
boundary, a layer rich in that component may be estab-
lished there, followed by depletion layer, and so on. This
so-called spinodal wave propagates into the bulk [8]. In

ultra-thin ﬁlms, the ﬁlm thickness is less than a single
spinodal wavelength and the spinodal wave is suppressed.
Two distinct outcomes of phase separation are identiﬁed,
depending on whether one binary ﬂuid component wets
the ﬁlm boundary completely or partially. Our focus will
be on the partially wet case. In this wetting regime, both
ﬂuid components are in contact with the ﬁlm boundaries.
The authors ﬁnd an ultimate state of domain formation
extending in the lateral directions and growing in time as
t1/3, a result that indicates domain growth by Lifshitz–
Slyozov diﬀusion [9].

These papers elucidate the role of wetting and ﬁlm
thickness on the process of phase separation, although
they do not discuss hydrodynamics or the eﬀect of free-
surface variations on domain formation. In this paper,
we therefore focus on ultra-thin ﬁlms with a variable free
surface, and for simplicity we restrict our attention to
the case where both ﬂuids experience the same interac-
tion with the substrate and free surface. The model we
introduce is based on the Navier–Stokes Cahn–Hilliard
(NSCH) equations [10] and gives a qualitative explana-
tion of these studies, in particular the tendency of domain
formation to cause ﬁlm rupture and surface roughening.
With an applied external forcing, the model illustrates
the salient eﬀect of the dynamical backreaction of con-
centration gradients on the ﬂow, a useful result in appli-
cations where control of phase separation is required [11].

possible [12]. We take the following dimensionless groups

variations in concentration, we show in what follows that
the model reproduces the qualitative features observed in
thin binary ﬂuids, especially in the case where both bi-
nary ﬂuid components interact identically with the sub-
strate and free surface [7].

For thin ﬁlms with h0 = 100–1000 nm [4, 5], the
dominant contribution to the potential is due to van
der Waals interactions [12, 13], and following these au-
thors we take φ = A/h3, where A is the dimensionless
Hamaker coeﬃcient. To prevent rupture [12], we study
ﬁlms where A < 0, and take A to be independent of

pair of domains separated by a smooth transition region.
Across this transition region, the height ﬁeld dips into a
valley. While the valley increases in depth for large back-
reaction strength r, the ﬁlm never ruptures. This result
follows from the inequality h′′ (0) > 0, since x = 0 is
a local minimum. Thus, from the equilibrium condition

In this way, the repulsive van der Waals potential has a
regularizing eﬀect on the solutions.

Physically, the formation of the valley arises from
the balance between the van der Waals and backreac-
tion eﬀects. From the solution in Fig. 1, the capillary
r∂x (∂xc)2 and the van der Waals force
force Fcap =
∂xh−3 always have opposite sign. The repul-
FvdW =
sive van der Waals force acts as a non-linear diﬀusion [14]
and inhibits rupture, and therefore Fcap promotes rup-
ture, a result seen in experiments [4]. The valley in the
height ﬁeld represents a balance between the smoothen-
ing and the rupture-inducing eﬀects.

As in ordinary Cahn–Hilliard dynamics [2], the one-
dimensional equilibrium solution hints at the late-time
conﬁguration in higher dimensions. Thus, we expect
the multidimensional solution to comprise concentra-
tion domains with a height ﬁeld of peaks and valleys,
with valleys occurring at domain boundaries. We have
veriﬁed with numerical simulations that this is indeed
the case. By using a measure of domain size (Lx, Ly)
based on the Fourier transform of the correlation func-
tion
[15], we have found that the do-
mains grow in time as t1/3, the usual Lifshitz-Slyozov

growth law [9]. Here x = (x, y) denotes the lateral coor-
dinates and
denotes the spatial average. The modi-
ﬁed growth exponent due to hydrodynamic eﬀects [2, 16]
is not observed, a result that emerges from the non-linear
diﬀusive character of the height equation, which damps
any undulations not caused by concentration gradients.
The surface roughness arising from the concentration gra-
dients is similar to that observed in the one-dimensional
case and has been seen in several experiments [4, 17].

The dramatic eﬀect of the reaction of the concen-
tration gradients on the phase separation is apparent
when we apply a surface tension gradient across the ﬁlm.
Physically, this can be realized by diﬀerential heating of
the surface [18], although a surfactant will also induce
stresses at the surface [19]. We set σ = σ0 sin kx, where
k = (2π/L) m = k0m is the spatial scale of the surface
tension variation and m is an integer. Then the velocity
that drives the system becomes

the concentration ﬁeld begins to form domains. At later
times, when Lx(t), Ly (t)
2π/k, the domains align with
the gradient of the forcing term. The growth of the
domains continues in this direction and is arrested (or
slowed down considerably) in the direction perpendicu-
lar to the forcing. The domains are string-like, with kinks
occurring along lines where σ (x, y) is minimized, as ev-
idenced by Fig. 2 (a)–(d). The growth of Lx and Ly is
shown in Fig. 4. It is not clear whether Ly is arrested or
undergoes slow linear growth and so we do not report its
growth rate.

For moderate values of the backreaction strength with
r
O(1), the height ﬁeld again assumes a proﬁle aligned
with the surface tension, while domains of concentration
now align in a direction perpendicular to the forcing gra-

dient. Domain growth continues in the perpendicular
direction and is arrested in the direction of the driving-
force gradient. A pattern of string-like domains emerges,
with domain boundaries forming along lines where both
σ (x, y) and h (x, y, t) are maximized. Eventually, the do-
main boundaries align perfectly with the surface tension
maxima, as evidenced in Fig. 2 (e)–(h).

The control of phase separation by surface shear there-
fore depends crucially on the backreaction. This result
is ampliﬁed by the existence of a no-rupture condition
only for the r = 0 case (no backreaction). This con-
dition relies on the alignment of the height and surface
tension proﬁles, which is exact only when the backre-
action is zero. Then, at late times, the system evolves
towards equilibrium and is described by the steady state
= 0, which by the alignment

since the strong eﬀect of the van der Waals diﬀusion de-
stroys the unforced part of h (x, t). At the same time,

Since x0 is a minimum of height, h′′ (x0) > 0, which
prevents h (x0) from being zero. On the other hand, for

r and σ0 suﬃciently large, the alignment of height and
surface tension proﬁles is not exact, the one-dimensional
state is never reached and hence the result in Eq. (4) does
not apply. In that case, simulations show that the ﬁlm
ruptures in ﬁnite time.

Given an applied surface tension gradient, we have out-
lined, by numerical simulations and calculations, three

desired outcome.

In conclusion, we have derived a thin-ﬁlm model of
phase separation based on the Navier–Stokes Cahn–
Hilliard equations, in which the reaction of concentra-
tion gradients on the ﬂow is important. We have used
this model to give a qualitative picture of the features
of phase separation in real thin ﬁlms, in particular the
tendency of concentration gradients to promote rupture
in the ﬁlm, and to produce peaks and valleys in the free
surface that mirror the underlying domain morphology.
We have found that in the presence of a unidirectional si-
nusoidal variation in surface tension, the strength of the
backreaction determines the direction in which the do-
mains align. This result could prove useful in microfab-
rication applications where control of phase separation is
required [11].

Because the lubrication model suppresses vertical vari-
ations in the concentration ﬁeld, we are limited to the
case where the binary ﬂuid components interact identi-
cally with the boundaries at the substrate and free sur-
face. However, the model quite generally gives an ac-
curate description of surface roughening arising from van
der Waals forces. More detailed models based on this ap-
proach, involving diﬀerent boundary conditions that bet-
ter reﬂect wetting behaviour [7, 21] and a concentration-
dependent Hamakar coeﬃcient, will capture a wider
range of thin-ﬁlm behaviour.

The temporal evolution of the ﬂuid circulation generated by a buoyancy force when two-
dimensional (2D) arrays of 2D thermals are released into a quiescent incompressible ﬂuid is studied
through the results of numerous lattice Boltzmann simulations. It is observed that the circulation
magnitude grows to a maximum value in a ﬁnite time. When both the maximum circulation and
the time at which it occurs are non-dimensionalised by appropriately deﬁned characteristic scales,
it is shown that two simple Prandtl number (Pr) dependent scaling relations can be devised that
ﬁt these data very well over nine decades of Pr spanning the viscous and diﬀusive regimes and six
decades of Rayleigh number (Ra) in the low Ra regime. Also, obtained analytically is the exact
result that circulation magnitude continues to grow in time for a single buoyant vortex ring in an
inﬁnite unbounded ﬂuid.

Buoyancy generated vorticity is an attractive area of
study for its inﬂuential role in various ﬁelds of science
and engineering, its relevance to mixing and, undoubt-
edly, for the aesthetically pleasing nature of its visualised
ﬂow structure (see, for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and the
references therein). Buoyant vortices are generated in
situations when plumes and thermals have diﬀerent tem-
peratures to the ambient ﬂuid. Following some classical
work on buoyant vortex rings and starting plumes [7, 8],
detailed studies on a single starting plume have generated
some understanding, though not yet complete, of the in-
teresting phenomena of mushroom-type vortex head gen-
eration and its pinch-oﬀ (see, for example, [9]). A num-
ber of studies on thermals have focused mainly on the
time evolution of the linear dimension of the thermal and
its penetration in the streamwise direction [10, 11, 12].
Lundgren et al. [10] has also provided some information
on the time evolution of the circulation. Further, eﬀects
of initial geometry of thermals on their evolution are in-
vestigated recently [13, 14]. Despite this considerable in-
terest, basic aspects of the buoyancy generated vorticity
mechanism remain to be elucidated, including the pres-
ence or otherwise of quantitative scaling laws in diﬀerent
regimes of Prandtl number (Pr).

In this letter, the results of numerous lattice Boltz-
mann simulations are used to investigate the universal
scaling behaviour associated with the circulation gener-
ated by buoyant forces when 2D thermals are released
into a quiescent incompressible ﬂuid. Also presented is an
analytical derivation showing that for a buoyant vortex
ring formed by releasing a thermal in an inﬁnite domain
of the quiescent ﬂuid the magnitude of the circulation
grows continuously in time.

In terms of the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z)

×

each of the simulated 2D systems comprised a 2Lx
×
1 sized domain of incompressible ﬂuid which was
2Ly
initially quiescent and of uniform density, ρ, and temper-
ature, T0. The centre of the domain coincided with the
origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. At time t = 0 a

circular (to within the lattice resolution) thermal of ini-
tial radius R0 < Lx, Ly and temperature T1 < T0 was in-
troduced into the centre of the domain. Cyclic boundary
conditions were applied at all lattice boundaries making
the simulation equivalent to that of an inﬁnite system ini-
tialised with an inﬁnite number of circular thermals posi-
tioned at the nodes of a rectangular array such that their
centres were separated by 2Lx in the x-direction and 2Ly
in the y-direction. The temperature diﬀerence causes the
thermals to move in the negative (downward) y-direction
which coincides with the direction of acceleration due
g ˆey, where ˆey is the unit vector in the y-
to gravity
direction. This motion is caused by the buoyancy force
acting on the thermal due to its density being diﬀerent
from the surrounding ﬂuid. For t > 0 the temperature
of the thermal diﬀuses and convects as it descends and
a vorticity ﬁeld with non-zero component ωz(x, y, t)
≡
u(x, y, t) = ∂xuy(x, y, t)
ω(x, y, t) =
∂yux(x, y, t) is
generated. Here, ux and uy are the ﬂuid velocity com-
ponents in the x and y-directions, respectively. This sys-
tem is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations with the

To reveal the scaling relations for Γmax and tmax a to-
tal of 211 individual LBM simulations of the governing
equations were performed using various combinations of
the parameters gα∆T , ν, κ, R0, Lx and Ly. Sets of sim-
ulations were performed in which all variables except one
were held constant and the values Γmax and tmax were
measured and recorded. The simulations were run for
suﬃcient times, between 3, 000 and 160, 000 time steps
depending on the parameter set, to enable the measure-
ment of the initial growth of circulation and its subse-
quent decay. The parameter ranges, in lattice Boltz-
10−5,
mann units, were as follows: 10−5 < αg∆T < 5
×
10−4 < ν < 19/6, 10−4 < κ < 1, 2/√π < R0 < 4
5/π,
30 < Lx < 500 and 30 < Ly < 500. These parame-
ters where combined so as to yield a wide range of di-
mensionless parameter values. Speciﬁcally: the Prandtl
number, Pr = ν/κ, ranged over nine decades (10−4 <
Pr < 104); the Rayleigh number, Ra = gα∆T R3
0/νκ,
10−5 < Ra < 38.5); and the as-
over six decades (1.4
pect ratios Λx = Lx/R0 and Λy = Ly/R0, over nearly
two decades (7.9 < Λx,y < 443). The range of Pr crosses
from the low to high (diﬀusive to viscous) Pr regimes;
the range of Ra, however, remains in the low Ra regime.
Firstly, the dependency of the parameters gα∆T , R0,
Lx or Ly was investigated by varying just one of these pa-
rameters and examining plots of Γmax and tmax versus
the varied parameter. This showed the following scaling

gα∆T
relations to hold: Γmax

(gα∆T )

on ν or κ was more complicated, as varying just one
of these and examining plots of Γmax and tmax versus
the varied parameter showed behaviour that depended
on Pr. These relations suggest appropriate characteristic
scales for circulation and time are Γ0
0 gα∆T /ν
x/ν, where the viscosity is used in the denom-
and t0
inator to ensure the correct dimensionality. Note that
one could have equally well chosen κ instead of ν. These
characteristic scales, Γ0 and t0, thus contain the correct
dependency of Γmax and tmax on all the parameters ex-
cept ν and κ. Along with (1) and (2), this suggests that
the maximum circulation and the time of its occurrence
may be written in the following dimensionless form which
depends only on Pr

but, to see the scaling relations, Γmax/Γ0 and tmax/t0
are plotted against Pr on log-log scales in Figure 1. The
abscissa covers nine decades of Pr and the ordinate,
about four decades of Γmax/Γ0 and tmax/t0. The ﬁg-
ures exhibit certain power laws which may be written

where the values of n and m are observed to be diﬀerent
in diﬀerent Pr regimes. The plots in Figure 1 suggest
that the values of n and m tend to constant values in the
limits of high and low Pr. Assuming this to be the case,
the following scaling relations, chosen for their simple
form and correct asymptotic behaviour, were ﬁtted to
the data

where a, nl, nh, b, ml and mh are constant ﬁtting param-
eters. A nonlinear least-squares Marquardt-Levenberg
algorithm was used to ﬁt the data. The ﬁtted scaling
relations are shown as black lines on the plots in Fig-
ure 1 and it can be seen that they do indeed give ex-
tremely good ﬁts to the data across all the Pr regimes.
The ﬁtted values of the ﬁtting parameters are, with stan-
dard errors: a = 0.4936
0.0015,
0.0015, ml =

three standard errors all of these may be given as the fol-
lowing simple fractions: a = 1/2, nl = 19/20, nh = 1/20,
b = 7/34, ml = 7/8 and mh = 1/8.
It is an inter-
esting observation, for which we have no explanation,
that the ﬁtted values suggest that nl = 1

mh. This suggests a single exponent scal-

The dependencies on the other dimensionless parame-
ters, Ra and the aspect ratio Λx = Lx/R0, can be high-
lighted by writing the scalings relations (3) and (4) as
Γmax/κ = ΛxRa f1 (Pr) and ν tmax/R2
x f2 (Pr).
The accuracy of scalings obtained for Γmax and tmax
are further conﬁrmed by the plots in Figures 2 and 3
of the alternatively non-dimensionalised Γmax and tmax
plotted against the two dimensionless parameters Ra and
Λx. In both ﬁgures the ﬁtted scaling relations are shown
as black lines, and again, the ﬁts are seen to be extremely
good.

The scaling relations given in (5) and (6) suggest that
in an inﬁnite domain, that is to say, Lx
, Γmax
and tmax tend to inﬁnity. A theoretical justiﬁcation for
this observation is now provided. The equation for the
non-zero component of vorticity, ω, can be written as

for example, [7] for a discussion of an ascending vortex
ring when T1 > T0). Due to the angular symmetry in the

its initial zero value in the inﬁnite domain. A similar ar-
gument would lead to identical conclusions for the magni-
tude of the circulation when the initial temperature, T1,
of thermal is greater than that of the surrounding ﬂuid,
T0. In this case, the thermal would rise in the z-direction
due to its density being less than the surrounding ﬂuid.
In this letter it has been found, through lattice Boltz-
mann simulations, that in an inﬁnite system comprising
an inﬁnite number of 2D thermals initially arranged in a
rectangular array the magnitude of the buoyancy gener-
ated circulation, Γ(t), reaches a maximum value, Γmax,
at a ﬁnite time, tmax. The carefully designed 211 in-
dividual simulations provided a database of Γmax and
tmax covering nine decades of Pr and six decades of Ra.
Accurate scaling relations for Γmax and tmax were in-
ferred from this data. It was observed through the scaling
relations that Γmax increases in proportion to the size of
the domain in the x-direction, that is Lx, while it is in-
dependent of the size in the y-direction, Ly. Theoretical
justiﬁcation has been provided for this observation. Fur-
ther, an exact result has been derived for Γmax in the
case of a buoyancy generated vortex ring, a 3D system
which is similar to a 2D system due to its axisymmetric
nature. This exact result shows that for a buoyant vor-
tex ring in an inﬁnite unbounded domain the magnitude
of Γ will continue to grow indeﬁnitely. It is hoped that
these results will inspire future work, for example: ﬁnding
scaling relations and exponents in 3D cases with diﬀerent
initial conﬁgurations of thermals, addressing why the ex-
ponents found here add up to unity, extending the study
to examine high Ra regimes.

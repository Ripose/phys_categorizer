Abstract

A rigorous method for introducing the variational principle describing relativistic ideal
hydrodynamic ﬂows with all possible types of discontinuities (including shocks) is presented
in the framework of an exact Clebsch type representation of the four-velocity ﬁeld as a
bilinear combination of the scalar ﬁelds. The boundary conditions for these ﬁelds on
the discontinuities are found. We also discuss the local invariants caused by the relabeling
symmetry of the problem and derive recursion relations linking invariants of diﬀerent types.
These invariants are of speciﬁc interest for stability problems. In particular, we present a
set of invariants based on the relativistic generalization of the Ertel invariant.

Introduction.
In this paper we discuss some problems related to ideal relativistic hydro-
dynamic (RHD) ﬂows in the framework of the special relativity. They are pertinent to the
description of ﬂows with discontinuities, including shocks, in terms of canonical (Hamiltonian)
variables based upon the corresponding variational principle and introducing local invariants
along with recursion relations. These subjects are of interest from a general point of view and
are very useful in solving nonlinear problems, speciﬁcally, nonlinear stability investigation, de-
scription of the turbulent ﬂows, etc. In particular, the use of the Hamiltonian approach along
with additional local invariants of the motion and the corresponding Casimirs allows to improve
the nonlinear stability criteria. The necessity to consider the relativistic ﬂows is motivated by a
wide area of applications, including the astrophysical and cosmological problems.

Variational principles for the ideal relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) ﬂows, without disconti-
nuities, have been widely discussed in the literature, see, for instance, [1–3] and citations therein.
As for the nonrelativistic ﬂows, the least action principle is conveniently formulated in terms of
the subsidiary ﬁelds and the corresponding velocity representation known as the Clebsch repre-
sentation, see [4–9]. These subsidiary ﬁelds can be introduced explicitly by means of the Weber
transformation, [10], see also [3, 4]. Alternatively, they naturally arise from the least action
principle as Lagrange multipliers for necessary constraints. Using these variables allows one to
describe the dynamics in terms of canonical (Hamiltonian) variables. The nontrivial charac-
ter of the Hamiltonian approach is due to the fact that the ﬂuid dynamics corresponds to the
degenerated case, see [11, 12].

Recently it was shown [13, 14] that the hydrodynamic ﬂows with discontinuities (including
shocks) can be described in terms of a least action principle, which includes (as well as natural
boundary conditions) the boundary conditions for the subsidiary ﬁelds. In the present paper we
show that all type of discontinuities can be described by means of the least action principle in
terms of the canonical variables for the relativistic ﬂows.

Variational principle. The relativistic least action principle can be formulated in close anal-
ogy to the nonrelativistic one. We introduce the action A,

with the Lagrangian density

A =

Z

d4x L,

L = −ǫ(n, S) + GJ αQ,α ,
G = (1, νB, Θ), Q = (ϕ, µB, S), B = 1, 2, 3,

where νB, Θ, ϕ, µB represent subsidiary ﬁelds; n, S and ǫ(n, S) denote the particle’s number,
entropy and energy proper densities, J α = nuα is the particle current, and uα is the four-velocity,
uα = u0(1, v/c), u0 = 1/
1 − v2/c2; comma denotes partial derivatives. Small Greek indexes
run from 0 to 3, and the Latin indexes run from 1 to 3; x0 = ct, r = (x1, x2, x3). The metric
tensor, gαβ, corresponds to the ﬂat space-time in Cartesian coordinates, gαβ = diag{−1, 1, 1, 1}.
The four-velocity obeys The normalization condition

p

uαuα = gαβuαuβ = −1.

Below we consider the four-velocity and the particle density n as dependent variables expressed
in terms of the particles current J α,

The ﬂuid energy obeys the second thermodynamic law

uα = J α/|J|, n = |J| =

−J αJα .

p

dǫ = nT dS + n−1wdn ≡ nT dS + W dn ,

where T is the temperature and w ≡ ǫ + p is the proper enthalpy density, p is the ﬂuid pressure,
W = w/n.

Variation of the action given by Eq. (1) with respect to the variables J α, Θ, and Q =
(ϕ, µB, S), which are supposed to be independent, A = A[J α, ϕ, µB , S, νB , Θ], results in the
following set of equations

δJ α :=⇒ W uα ≡ Vα = −GQ,α ,

δϕ :=⇒ J α

,α = 0,

δµB :=⇒ ∂α(J ανB) = 0,

or DνA = 0,

δνB :=⇒ DµB = 0,

δS :=⇒ ∂α(J αΘ),

or DΘ = −T,

δΘ :=⇒ DS = 0,

Dϕ = W.

where D ≡ uα∂α. Eq. (6) gives us the Clebsch type velocity representation, cf. Ref. [2]. Con-
tracting it with uα results in the dynamic equation for the scalar potential ϕ,

Both triplets µB and νB represent the advected subsidiary ﬁelds and do not enter the internal
energy. Therefore, it is natural to treat one of them, say, µB as the ﬂow line label.

Taking into account that the entropy and particle conservation are incorporated into the set of
variational equations, it is easy to make sure that the equations of motion for the subsidiary vari-
ables along with the velocity representation reproduces the relativistic Euler equation. The latter
corresponds to the orthogonal to the ﬂow lines projection of the ﬂuid stress-energy-momentum
T αβ conservation, cf. Ref.

[16, 17],

T αβ

,β = 0, T αβ ≡ wuαuβ + pgαβ.

We may then write the relativistic Euler equation as

where the thermodynamic relation

(Vα,β − Vβ,α)uβ = T S,α ,

dp = ndW − nT dS

is taken into account. The vector Vα, sometimes called the Taub current, [15], plays an important
role in relativistic ﬂuid dynamics, especially in the description of circulation and vorticity. Note
that W can be interpreted as an injection energy (or chemical potential), cf., for instance [16],
i.e., the energy per particle required to inject a small amount of ﬂuid into a ﬂuid sample, keeping
the sample volume and the entropy per particle S constant. Therefore, Vα is identiﬁed with the
four-momentum per particle of a small amount of ﬂuid to be injected in a larger sample of ﬂuid
without changing the total ﬂuid volume and the entropy per particle.

Boundary conditions.
In order to complete the variational approach for the ﬂows with dis-
continuities, it is necessary to formulate the boundary conditions for the subsidiary variables,
which do not imply any restrictions on the physically possible discontinuities (the shocks, tan-
gential and contact discontinuities), are consistent with the corresponding dynamic equations,
and thus are equivalent to the conventional boundary conditions, i.e., to continuity of the parti-
cle and energy-momentum ﬂuxes intersecting the discontinuity surface R(xα) = 0, cf. Ref. [17],

{ ˘J} = 0,

˘J ≡ J αnα ,

{T αβnβ} = 0,

where nα denotes the unit normal vector to the discontinuity surface,

nα = Nα/N, Nα = R,α N =

NαN α ,

p

and braces denote jump, {X} ≡ X|R=+0 − X|R=−0.

Our aim is to obtain boundary conditions as natural boundary conditions for the variational
principle. In the process of deriving the volume equations we have applied integration by parts
to the term J αGδQ,α. Vanishing of the corresponding surface term along with that resulting
from the variation of the surface itself will lead to the appropriate boundary conditions after the
variational principle has been speciﬁed.

Rewriting the (volume) action with the discontinuity surface being taken into account in

explicit form as

A =

Xς=±1

Lςθ(ςR) ,

where θ stands for the step-function, we obtain the residual part of the (volume) action in the
form

δA|res =

Xς=±1

[ςLδD(R)δR + θ(ςR)∂α(J αGδQ)] .

Here δD denotes Dirac’s delta-function and we omit the index ς labeling the quantities that cor-
respond to the ﬂuid regions divided by the interface at R = 0; the superscript ς ≷ 0 corresponds
to the quantities in the regions R ≷ 0, respectively. Integrating the second term by parts and
ς=±1 ∂α (θ(ςR)(uαGδQ)) vanishes due to vanishing of
supposing that the surface integral
the variations δQ at inﬁnity, we arrive at the residual action expressed by the surface integral

which are equivalent to continuity of the momentum and energy ﬂuxes, cf. Eq. (17). Here we
consider that the ‘on shell’ value of the volume Lagrangian density, Leq, is equal to the pressure,
Leq = −ǫ + nGDQ = −ǫ + w = p.

Now we can complete formulation of the variational principle appropriate both for continuous
and discontinuous ﬂows. The independent volume variables are indicated above, and independent
variations of the surface variables are δR, δf β, the variations of the surface restrictions of the
generalized coordinates δϕ, δµB, supposed to be equal from both sides of the discontinuity,
{δϕ} = {δµB} = 0, and δS with {δS} 6= 0. Under these assumptions we arrive at the following
subset of the boundary conditions

Eqs. (23)–(25) reproduce the usual boundary conditions, and Eqs. (26), (27) are the boundary
conditions for the subsidiary variables. Other boundary conditions for the latter variables do not
strictly follow from the variational principle under discussion. But we can ﬁnd them from the
corresponding volume equations of motion, providing, for instance, that they are as continuous
as possible.1 The natural choice corresponds to continuity of their ﬂuxes,

{nαuαnϕ} ≡ ˇJ {ϕ} = 0.

The set of the boundary conditions given by Eqs. (23)–(29) is complete and allows one to
describe any type of discontinuities, including shocks. For the latter case ˇJ 6= 0 and we arrive
at continuity of the variables νB, µB, ϕ and zero boundary value of Θ. For ˇJ = 0 the ﬂow lines
do not intersect the discontinuity surface and we obtain very weak restrictions on the boundary
1Note that the choice of the boundary conditions for the ﬁelds ϕ, µB, νB and Θ is not unique due to the
fact that they play the roles as generalized potentials and therefore possess the corresponding gauge freedom
relating to the transformations ϕ, µB, νB, Θ → ϕ′, µ′B, ν′
α = uα (given by the representation
(6)). For instance, it seems possible to use entropy S as one of the ﬂow line markers. But if we are dealing
with discontinuous ﬂows then it is necessary to distinguish the Lagrange markers of the ﬂuid lines, µB, and the
entropy, S. Namely, the label of the particle intersecting a shock surface evidently does not change, but the
entropy does change. Thus, entropy can be chosen as one of the ﬂow line markers only for the ﬂows without
entropy discontinuities.

values of the subsidiary variables, cf. the nonrelativistic case discussed in Refs. [13, 14]. Note
that for the speciﬁc case ˇJ = 0 (slide and contact discontinuities) we can simplify the variational
principle assuming all both-side variations of the subsidiary variables to be independent.

The above variational principle allows modiﬁcations. First, it is possible to exclude con-
straints, expressing the four-velocity by means of the representation (6). In this case the volume
Lagrangian density can be chosen to coincide with the ﬂuid pressure, cf. Ref. [2], where the
continuous ﬂows are discussed in detail. Second, we can include into the action the surface term
[13, 14, 18, 19], where such surface terms are
respective for the surface constraints, cf. Refs.
discussed for ideal hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in the nonrelativistic limit. This
can be done for the cases both with excluded and non excluded volume constraints.

Canonical variables. Starting from the action in Eq. (1) and Lagrangian density given by
Eq. (2) we can introduce the canonical (Hamiltonian) variables according to the general receipt.
Let Q represents the canonical coordinates then

P ≡

δA
δQ,0

= J 0G ≡ (πϕ , πµB , πS)

provides the conjugate momenta. Relations (30) cannot be solved for the generalized velocities
Q,0 suggesting that we are dealing with the degenerated (constraint) system, cf. Refs. [3,5,11,12].
But the constraints are of the ﬁrst type. Thus, performing the Legendre transform with respect
to Q we arrive at the Hamiltonian density

H = P Q,0 − p(W, S),

where we suppose that the four-velocity is given by representation (6). Making use of the deﬁ-
nition (30) and of the time component of the velocity representation, Eq. (6), we can transform
the ﬁrst term in Eq. (31) as

P Q,0 = J 0GQ,0 = −πϕV0 = πϕV 0.

Taking into account the normalization condition for the Taub current, VαV α = −W 2, we obtain

Consequently, we arrive at the following Hamiltonian density

V 0 =

W 2 + VaV a .

p

H ≡ H(P, Q, Q,a; W ) =

W 2 + VaV a πϕ − p(W, S).

p
In terms of the canonical coordinates and momenta the space components of the velocity are

The canonical equations following from this Hamiltonian reproduce in a 3+1 form the dynamical
equations above for the variables entering the Taub current representation. Variation of the
action with respect to the chemical potential W results in the identity

Obviously, this relation is equivalent to Eq. (33), expressing the particle density n in terms of
the variables entering the Hamiltonian.

We emphasize that the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (34) depends not only on the generalized
coordinates ϕ, µB, S, their spatial derivatives and conjugate momenta, but also on the chemical
potential W as well. Evidently, we can consider W as the additional generalized coordinate with
zero conjugate momentum, πW = 0. This condition is consistent with the dynamic equations
due to the fact that ∂0πW = ∂H/∂W = 0, cf. Eq. (36).

Bearing in mind that we are dealing with ﬂows having discontinuities, it is seen that in
the discussed variant of the least action principle we do not arrive at the additional surface
variables except for the variable deﬁning the discontinuity surface, R. But this enters the
action functional without derivatives. Therefore, the corresponding conjugate momentum is
zero-valued. Introducing the Hamiltonian variables for the ﬂows with discontinuities we have to
treat R as the surface function, deﬁning some (surface) constraint. The latter is nothing else
than continuity of the normal component of the ﬂuid momentum ﬂux, Eq. (23).

Local invariants and recursion relations.
In addition to energy, momentum, and angular
momentum conservation, for the ideal hydrodynamic ﬂows there exist speciﬁc local conserva-
tion laws related to the advected and frozen-in ﬁelds, and corresponding topological invariants
(vorticity, helicity, Ertel invariant, etc.), cf. Refs. [3–5, 9, 20] and citations therein for the non-
relativistic case. They are caused by the relabeling symmetry, cf. Ref. [9]. Discussion of these
problems along with the recursion relations linking the four diﬀerent types of invariants for the
relativistic ﬂows seems insuﬃcient or absent in the literature , see Refs. [1–3, 15, 21] and cita-
tions therein. Exploitation of the above description permit us considering these invariants in a
simpliﬁed form. Here we shall brieﬂy discuss the invariants and recursion relations.

The local Lagrangian invariants, say I, correspond to advected (dragged) quantities,

The partial derivative of each scalar Lagrange invariant gives us the simplest example of the
Lamb type momentum, Lα, which satisfy the following relations

The next type of invariants are vector conserved quantities, X α, being proportional to the four-
velocity, i.e.,

,α = 0, X α = |X|uα.
The trivial example of such quantities is the particle current J α = nuα. The last type corresponds
to the frozen-in ﬁelds, Mαβ, deﬁned as the antisymmetric tensors obeying the following equation

(39)

X α

DMαβ + uγ

,αMγβ + uγ

,βMαγ = 0, Mβα = −Mαβ .

Now we can derive some recursion relations. First, an arbitrary function of the Lagrangian

invariants is also Lagrangian invariant,

DI = 0.

DLα + uβ

,αLβ = 0,

I ′′ = F (I, I ′, . . .) .

Second, multiplication of any invariant by the Lagrange invariant results in the invariant of the
same type. Symbolically,

α = ILα , X ′α = IX α , M ′

αβ = IMαβ.

(48)
Here ǫαβµν is Levi-Civita tensor. Note that the latter relation follows from the fact that the
conserved current deﬁned by Eq. (47) is collinear to the four-velocity, X α = |X|uα ≡ −|X|J α/n.
Consequently, |X| = −X αuα, and |X|/n = I is an advected scalar. Note also that we can easily
arrive at the conserved four-currents, say Z α, which are not necessarily collinear to the velocity
ﬁeld. In analogy with relation (47) we ﬁnd

Other examples of such conserved currents are as follows

Z α

,α = 0 for Z α = ǫαβµνLβ,µI,ν .

where ∗M αβ is dual to Mαβ.

These recursion relations represent a strict analog of the nonrelativistic ones, cf. Refs. [3,5,20]
and can be proved by direct calculations. Existence of these four types of invariants is related to
the dimensionality of the space-time as becomes evident if we remember that they correspond
to the diﬀerential forms of 0th, 1st, 2nd and 3rd order, cf., for instance, Ref. [16]. The recursion
procedure allows one to study the structure of the invariants.

It is noteworthy that not all invariants could be obtained by means of the recursion procedure.
For ﬂows of general type there also exists the Ertel invariant (or the potential vorticity), cf.
Ref. [21]. The corresponding conserved four-current is of the form

E α = −

ǫαβµνωβµS,ν = −∗ωανS,ν ,

where ωβµ is the (Khalatnikov) vorticity tensor, ωβµ = Vµ,β − Vβ,µ, and ∗ωαν is its dual. The
vorticity tensor obeys the following equation

Dωαν + ωαβuβ

,ν + ωβνuβ

,α = T,νS,α − T,αS,ν ≡ n−2(n,αp,ν − n,νp,α) .

(54)

It can be proved that E α is divergence-free (the easiest way is to use the above velocity repre-
sentation) and

E α = EJ α, DE = 0,
(55)
where E is a direct generalization of the well-known nonrelativistic potential vorticity. If the
vorticity tensor would be the frozen-in quantity then conservation of the vector given by Eq. (53)
would follow from the above recursion relations. But for the non-barotropic ﬂows it is not so.
Here ωαν obeys Eq. (54) and becomes a frozen-in ﬁeld only for the barotropic (isentropic, in
particular) ﬂows. Nevertheless, the Ertel current is conserved. Therefore, the basic invariants
may be obtained by direct calculations.

It is interesting to note that for the non-barotropic ﬂows there exists a conserved current

generalizing the helicity current. Consider the reduced Taub vector,

where Θ obeys Eq. (10), and the corresponding reduced vorticity tensor

e

Vα ≡ Vα + ΘS,α ,

This tensor is orthogonal to the ﬂow lines,

e

ωαβ ≡

To derive a set of local invariants we have to start with those following directly from the
hydrodynamic equations and then apply the above recursion relations. As the simplest example
consider the non-barotropic ﬂow. Then one can start with the speciﬁc entropy S and the Ertel
invariant E. It is easy to show that the general form of the gauge-independent scalar invariants
is

I = F (S, E),

where F is arbitrary function, cf. the nonrelativistic case, [3]. The structure of the complete
set of invariants diﬀers for the diﬀerent type of ﬂows and will be discussed in forthcoming
publications. For instance, for the barotropic ﬂows we have the independent frozen in ﬁeld
Mαβ = ωαβ in addition to the scalar invariants of the ﬁrst generation, S and E. This fact allows
one to obtain a more complicated set of the invariants.

Conclusion. We have shown that it is possible to describe the relativistic ideal ﬂuids with all
physically allowable discontinuities in terms of the least action principle both in the Lagrangian
and Hamiltonian description. The boundary conditions for the subsidiary variables, entering the
Clebsch type velocity representation, are obtained in two diﬀerent ways: one way follows from
the variational principle as natural boundary conditions while the other one was obtained from
the dynamical equations under the assumption relating to the absence of the corresponding
sources and the maximal continuity compatible with the volume equations.
It is possible to
change the variational principle in such a way that all boundary conditions will result from it,
i.e., they become natural boundary conditions. For this purpose it is necessary to modify the
variational principle by adding a surface term with corresponding constraints, similarly to the
nonrelativistic case (compare with the papers [13, 14] for the hydrodynamics and [18, 19] for the
magnetohydrodynamics). These variants will be discussed in future works.

The approach discussed in this paper allowed us to give a simple treatment of the additional
invariants of motion and present a set of recursion relations linking diﬀerent types of invari-
ants. In particular, we presented a generalization of the helicity invariant for the non-barotropic
relativistic ﬂows. This approach is suitable for the general relativity and for the relativistic mag-
netohydrodynamics as well. The discontinuous ﬂows for the general relativity can be described
in analogy with the above discussion and the results will be published elsewhere.

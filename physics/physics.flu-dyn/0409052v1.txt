(Received 31 July 2013)

We present high-precision measurements of the Nusselt number N as a function of the
Rayleigh number R for cylindrical samples of water (Prandtl number σ = 4.4) with a
diameter D of 49.7 cm and heights L = 116.3, 74.6, and 50.6 cm, as well as for D = 24.8
cm and L = 90.2 cm. For each aspect ratio Γ ≡ D/L = 0.28, 0.43, 0.67, and 0.98 the data
cover a range of a little over a decade of R. The maximum R ≃ 1012 and Nusselt number
N ≃ 600 were reached for Γ = 0.43 and D = 49.7. The data were corrected for the
inﬂuence of the ﬁnite conductivity of the top and bottom plates on the heat transport in
the ﬂuid to obtain estimates of N∞ for plates with inﬁnite conductivity. The results for
N∞ and Γ ≥ 0.43 are nearly independent of Γ. For Γ = 0.275 N∞ falls about 2.5 % below
the other data. For R <∼ 1011, the eﬀective exponent γef f of N∞ = N0Rγef f is about
0.321, larger than those of the Grossmann-Lohse model with its current parameters by
about 0.01. For the largest Rayleigh numbers covered for Γ = 0.98, 0.67, and 0.43, γef f
saturates at the asymptotic value γ = 1/3 of the Grossmann-Lohse model. The data do
not reveal any crossover to a Kraichnan regime with γef f > 1/3.

1. Introduction

Understanding turbulent Rayleigh-B´enard convection (RBC) in a ﬂuid heated from
below [Siggia(1994), Kadanoﬀ(2001), Ahlers, Grossmann & Lohse (2002)] is one of the
challenging and largely unsolved problems in nonlinear physics. An important aspect is
the global heat transport that is usually expressed in terms of the Nusselt number

N = QL/λ∆T .

(1.1)

Here Q is the heat-current density, L the sample height, ∆T the applied temperature
diﬀerence, and λ the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid in the absence of convection.
A central prediction of various theoretical models [Siggia(1994), Grossmann & Lohse
(2000), Grossmann & Lohse (2001), Grossmann & Lohse (2002), Grossmann & Lohse
(2004)] is a relationship between N , the Rayleigh number R = αg∆T L3/κν (α is the
isobaric thermal expension coeﬃcient, κ the thermal diﬀusivity, ν the kinematic viscosity,
and g the acceleration of gravity), and the Prandtl number σ = ν/κ. A model developed
recently by Grossmann & Lohse (2000), based on the decomposition of the kinetic and
the thermal dissipation into boundary-layer and bulk contributions, provided an excellent
ﬁt to experimental data of Xu, Bajaj & Ahlers(2000) and Ahlers & Xu (2001) for a
cylindrical cell of aspect ratio Γ ≡ D/L = 1 (D is the sample diameter) when it was

properly adapted [Grossmann & Lohse (2001), GL] to the relatively small Reynolds
numbers of the measurements. However, the data were used to determine ﬁve adjustable
parameters of the model. Thus more stringent tests using measurements for the same
Γ but over wider ranges of R and σ are desirable. A great success of the model was
the excellent agreement with recent results by Xia, Lam & Zhou(2002) for much larger
Prandtl numbers than those of Ahlers & Xu (2001), at Rayleigh numbers near 1.78 × 107
and 1.78 × 109.

Here we present new measurements in a cell of diameter D = 49.7 cm for σ ≃ 4.4 that,
for Γ = 0.98, extend to R ≃ 1011. We also report results for D = 49.7 cm and Γ = 0.427
and 0.667, as well as for D = 24.8 cm and Γ = 0.275. For Γ >∼ 0.5 it is expected that
the large-scale ﬂow (LSF) in the cell [Krishnamurty & Howard(1981)] consists of a single
convection roll [Verzicco & Camussi(2003)]. For Γ <∼ 0.5, on the other hand, Verzicco &
Camussi(2003) suggest that the system contains two or more rolls placed vertically one
above the other. How this impacts the heat transport was one of the interesting questions
to be addressed. Our results suggest that even the cell with Γ = 0.43 still contained only
one roll because the data for N fall on a smooth line drawn through those for the larger
Γ. The Γ = 0.28 results fall about 2.5% below all the other data, suggesting a more
complicated, perhaps two-roll, structure for the LSF.

Most of our measurements were made at a mean temperature of 40◦C, where σ = 4.38.
However, for Γ = 0.67 we also made measurements at mean temperatures of 50 and 30◦C,
corresponding to σ = 3.62 and 5.42 respectively. We found a very gentle decrease of N
with increasing σ, approximately in proportion to σ−0.044.

One of the experimental problems in the measurement of N (R) is that the side wall
often carries a signiﬁcant part of the heat current. Corrections for this eﬀect are not
easily made, because of the thermal contact between the wall and the ﬂuid that yields
a two-dimensional temperature ﬁeld in the wall, and because of the inﬂuence of lateral
heat currrents through the wall on the ﬂuid ﬂow [Ahlers(2000), Roche et al.(2001), Verz-
icco(2002), Niemela & Sreenivasan (2003)]. The present project was designed to provide
data that are not uncertain due to a signiﬁcant side-wall correction. We used a classical
ﬂuid of relatively large conductivity conﬁned by side walls of relatively low conductivity.
The system of choice was water conﬁned by Plexiglas with various heights L, and with
the greatest diameter permitted by other constraints. We built four convection cells,
three with D = 49.67 cm with heights L = 116.33, 74.42, and 50.61 cm, and one with
D = 24.81 cm and L = 90.18 cm. For the Γ = 0.98 (L = 50.61) cell, which is most relevant
to comparison with the theoretical model of GL, we estimated a wall correction [using
Model 2 of Ahlers(2000)] of only 0.3% for R = 5 × 109(N ≃ 100) and smaller corrections
for larger R. Based on this estimate we felt justiﬁed in neglecting the correction.

A second experimental problem was pointed out recently by Chaumat et al.(2002) and
by Verzicco(2004). Using direct numerical simulation, Verzicco(2004) showed that end
plates of ﬁnite conductivity diminish the heat transport in the ﬂuid when the Nusselt
number becomes large. In a separate paper we shall give details of the apparatus used
in our work [Nikolaenko et al. (2004)]. There we will describe measurements using two
types of top and bottom plates of identical shape and size, but one set made of copper
with a conductivity λCu = 391 W/m K and the other of aluminum with λAl = 161 W/m
K. That work yielded a correction factor that has been applied to the data reported here.

2. Results

2.1. The measurements
Details of the apparatus and of experimental procedures are given by Nikolaenko et al.
(2004). The precision of the measurements is typically near 0.1 percent, and systematic
errors, primarily due to uncertainties of the diameter and length of the cell, are estimated
to be well below one percent. Deviations from the Boussinesq approximation are believed
to be unimportant [Nikolaenko et al. (2004)]. We give the results in Tables 1 to 4. The
measured N derived from Eq. 1.1 as well as the Nusselt number N∞ obtained after
correction for the ﬁnite top- and bottom-plate conductivity [Verzicco(2004)] are listed.
The relation between these is given by N = f (X)N∞ where X is the ratio of the average
thermal resistance of the plates to that of the ﬂuid. We used the empirical function
f (X) = 1 − exp[−(aX)b], with the parameters a = 0.275 and b = 0.390 for D = 49.7,
and a = 0.304 and b = 0.506 for D = 24.82, determined experimentally [Nikolaenko et al.
(2004)]. The parameters were found to be independent of the aspect ratio but to depend
on the plate diameter.

2.2. Dependence on R and Γ
The results for N∞ are shown on logarithmic scales in Fig. 1a and with greater resolution
in the compensated form N∞/R1/3 in Fig. 1b. We note that over most of the range of
R the data for Γ ≥ 0.43 reveal very little if any dependence of N∞ on Γ. Recent consid-
erations by Grossmann & Lohse (2003) had suggested a stronger Γ-dependence. Earlier
experimental data [Wu & Libchaber(1992), Xu, Bajaj & Ahlers(2000)] also suggested a
stronger Γ dependence; but those results were inﬂuenced by side-wall and/or end-plate

eﬀects. Note for instance that the side-wall correction made by Ahlers(2000) considerably
reduced the Γ dependence originally seen by Xu, Bajaj & Ahlers(2000). Similarly, our
present results for N reveal some dependence on Γ, but the end-plate correction largely
removes it. It is particularly noteworthy that the data for Γ = 0.43 are not shifted signif-
icantly relative to those for Γ = 0.67 because on the basis of the numerical calculations
of Verzicco & Camussi(2003) one expects diﬀerent structures for the LSF for these two
cases. The data for Γ = 0.275 are lower by about 2.5%, suggesting that a transition in
the LSF structure may occur between Γ = 0.43 and 0.275.

A second important feature of the data is their dependence on R. Locally, over a limited

range, the measurements can be ﬁt by the powerlaw

N∞ = N0Rγef f .

Open squares: Γ = 0.275. Solid circles: Γ = 0.43. Open circles: Γ = 0.67. Solid squares: Γ = 0.98.
Solid lines: the prediction of Grossmann & Lohse (2001) for σ = 4.4.

For the eﬀective exponent we found γef f = 0.323 for Γ = 1 near R = 2 × 1010 and
γef f = 0.329 for Γ = 0.67 near R = 1011. As shown in Fig. 2, a single ﬁt to most of
the data for Γ = 0.98, 0.67, and 0.43 yields γef f = 0.322. All these values are close to,
but deﬁnitely less than, the asymptotic large-R prediction γ = 1/3 of the GL model.
However, they are larger by about 0.01 or 0.015 than the GL prediction for Γ = 1 at the
same R. This can also be seen qualitatively from Fig. 1b where the GL prediction with
its present parameter values is shown as a solid line. It remains to be seen whether the
model parameters can be adjusted so as to reproduce this feature.

Another interesting aspect noticeable in Fig. 1b is that for Γ = 0.98, 0.67, and 0.43
there is a seemingly sudden change in the R-dependence of N∞ at large R to a power
law with γ = 1/3, i.e. with the asymptotic prediction of the GL model. This is illustrated
more clearly in Fig. 2 which shows the relevant data with higher resolution. It is diﬃcult
to see how the GL model can reproduce this rather sudden transition at ﬁnite R to
its asymptotic exponent value. Rather, it seems likely that a new physical phenomenon
not yet contained in the model will have to be invoked. The transition occurs for Γ =
0.98, 0.67, and 0.43 near R = 5 × 1010, 9 × 1010, and 3 × 1011 respectively and is reﬂected
in the observation that the data for larger R fall on horizontal lines in the ﬁgures. In
this range the measurements do reveal a dependence on Γ, with N0(γef f = 1/3) =
0.0606, 0.0602, and 0.0595 for Γ = 0.98, 0.67, and 0.43 respectively. One interpretation
of these results for N0 is that the heat transport is diminished, albeit only very slightly,
by a larger travel distance, and presumably a larger period, of the LSF. At smaller R
an eﬀective powerlaw with N0 = 0.0797, γef f = 0.322 (solid line in Fig. 2) ﬁts the data
at all three Γ values within their statistical uncertainty, showing that the results are
essentially Γ independent. It is a surprise that the data for Γ = 0.67 and 0.43 do not
diﬀer more from each other because diﬀerent structures for the LSF had been predicted
for these two cases. [Verzicco & Camussi(2003)] The Γ = 0.275 results do indeed have
a Nusselt number that is smaller by about 2 to 3%, suggesting that the transition in
the ﬂow structure occurred between Γ = 0.43 and 0.275. Those result do not show the
saturation at large R with γef f = 1/3, and lead to γef f = 0.321 over their entire range.

2.3. Dependence on the Prandtl number σ
The Nusselt number N∞(σ) has a broad maximum near σ ≃ 4. Thus the dependence of
N on σ is very weak and diﬃcult to determine from measurements with various ﬂuids
of diﬀerent σ because of systematic errors due the uncertainties of the ﬂuid proper-
ties [Ahlers & Xu (2001), Xia, Lam & Zhou(2002)]. We determined N (σ, R) with high
precision over a narrow range of σ by using the same convection cell and by chang-
ing the mean temperature. In that case errors from diﬀerent cell geometries are largely
absent and the properties are known very well. Similar measurements over the ranges
5 × 106 ≤ R ≤ 5 × 108 and 4 ≤ σ ≤ 6.5 were made by Liu & Ecke(1997). Their results

can be represented well by

N = N00σαef f Rγef f
(2.2)
with γef f = 0.286, αef f = −0.030, and N00 = 0.1780. The negative value of αef f
indicates that the maximum of N (σ) is below σ ≃ 4.

We used our Γ = 0.67 cell and made measurements at 30, 40, and 50◦C corresponding
to σ = 5.42, 4.38, and 3.62 respectively. The results are included in Table 3, and in the
compensated form N∞/R1/3 they are shown as a function of R in Fig. 3a. Over the range
2 × 1010 ≤ R ≤ 4 × 1011 they yield αef f ≃ −0.044, indicating that also for this range of R
the maximum of N (σ) occurs below σ = 4. The reduced Nusselt number N∞σ0.044/R1/3
is shown in Fig. 3b. It shows that the data, within their experimental uncertainty, collapse
onto a unique curve when divided by σαef f . The observed σ-dependence is somewhat
stronger than that of the GL model with its present parameter values.

2.4. Comparison with other results
Measurements of N (R) for Γ = 0.50 over the range 108 ≤ R ≤ 5 × 1010 and a wide range
of σ were made at cryogenic temperatures using gaseous helium by Roche et al.(2004).
A direct, highly quantitative comparison with our results is possible only for the data
points with σ-values fairly close to ours where the σ-dependence of N can reasonably
be expected to be given by Eq. 2.2 with αef f ≃ −0.044. In Fig. 4a we show results of
Roche et al.(2004) for N∞σ0.044/R1/3 as a function of R. These data were corrected by
the authors for the side-wall conductance, using a procedure described by them. Because
of the small conductivity of helium gas one expects end-plate corrections to be negligible
in this case. We also show our results for comparison. One sees that the data of Roche
et al.(2004) fall into three well deﬁned groups, with a nearly uniform vertical spacing
between them of close to four percent. There is excellent agreement/consistency of the
uppermost branch with our data for Γ = 0.98, 0.67, and 0.43. This is consistent with
the absence of any signiﬁcant aspect-ratio dependence in our data. The existence of the
lower two branches is more diﬃcult to reconcile with our results. Roche et al.(2004)

suggest that they encountered more than one distinct state of their LSF. In our work
we never found multi-stability for any Γ, and the data for Γ = 0.67 and 0.43 (which
according to the calculations of Verzicco & Camussi(2003) should correspond to diﬀerent
ﬂow structures) agree with each other and are consistent with the upper branch of Roche
et al., at least in the range where γef f has not yet saturated at γef f = 1/3. Our data for
Γ = 0.28 are lower than those for our larger Γ, suggesting a diﬀerence in the LSF and
indicating that the transition from a single cell to a more complicated structure occurs at
Γ < 0.43 in our system. However, our results for Γ = 0.28 are only about 2 or 3 % lower
than the larger-Γ data and not as low as the results from the middle or lower branch of
Roche et al.

In Fig. 4b we compare our results with those of Chavanne et al.(2001) from cryogenic
experiments for 2.0 ≤ σ ≤ 4.5 and Γ = 0.50. The end-plate corrections are expected to
be negligible. Because of the low conductivity of the ﬂuid, the side-wall contribution to
the conductance of the cell is signiﬁcant, but apparently no correction was made. The
authors interpret their data to imply γef f ≃ 0.38, and attribute the large value to a
breakdown of the boundary layers adjacent to the top and bottom plates. In that case
one expects that a new regime ﬁrst proposed by Kraichnan(1962) with an asymptotic
exponent γ = 1/2 (and logarithmic corrections) should be entered. Our data do not
reveal such a large exponent, and in the overlapping range 1011 <∼ R <∼ 2 × 1012 remain
consistent with γef f = 1/3.

Finally, in Fig. 5 we compare our results for Γ = 0.98, 0.67, and 0.43 (solid circles
where γef f ≃ 0.32 and stars where γef f ≃ 0.333) and Γ = 0.28 (solid squares) on a less
sensitive vertical scale with several measurements at cryogenic temperatures. A more
comprehensive comparison was presented by Niemela & Sreenivasan (2003) (NS) [we
choose the same representation in terms of N∞/R0.309 that was used by them in their
Fig. 5]. There are systematic diﬀerences between the data sets that are, according to
NS, larger than possible systematic errors in the experiments. Our data show very little
change of γef f with R, and the solid circles in Fig. 5 yield γef f ≃ 0.321. The data by

NS (connected open circles) show a dependence on R that diﬀers from ours, with γef f
varying from about 0.28 to about 0.35 as R changes from 109 to 1012. The data of Niemela
et al. (2000) do not show such a strong variation of γef f and can be described well by
a single γef f = 0.30 over the R-range of the ﬁgure. The data of Chavanne et al.(2001)
(open diamonds) are on average slightly larger than ours but have an R-dependence that
is consistent with that of ours.

We have been unable to rationalize the large variations of the eﬀective exponents of
N from one experiment to another, and in the case of the data of NS within a single
experiment with R, in terms of known ﬂuid mechanics. NS suggested that diﬀerences in
the LSF structure are responsible, and state that “such diﬀerences seem to arise from
delicate interplay among detailed geometry as well as Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers”.
Looking at our data, the absence of any signiﬁcant Γ-dependence is apparent from the
clustering of the data for Γ ≥ 0.43 (solid circles) near the straight dash-dotted line
corresponding to γef f = 0.3207; i.e. Γ per se does not play a major role. Even for
Γ = 0.28, where the data are displaced vertically in the ﬁgure, presumably because of a
change in the LSF, they have nearly the same eﬀective exponent γef f = 0.3193 (dotted
line). Thus it appears from our data that diﬀerences in the LSF do not have a large eﬀect
on the R-dependence of N∞(R). We wish we had a more satisfying explanation of the
diﬀerent results obtained by the various experiments.

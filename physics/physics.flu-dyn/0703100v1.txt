(Received 21 February 2014)

We investigate the eﬀect of microbubbles on Taylor-Couette ﬂow by means of direct
numerical simulations. We employ an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach with a gas-ﬂuid
coupling based on the point-force approximation. Added mass, drag, lift, and gravity are
taken into account in the modeling of the motion of the individual bubble. We ﬁnd that
very dilute suspensions of small non-deformable bubbles (volume void fraction below
1%, zero Weber number and bubble Reynolds number . 10) induce a robust statistically
steady drag reduction (up to 20%) in the so called wavy vortex ﬂow regime (Re =
600-2500). The Reynolds number dependence of the normalized torque (the so-called
Torque Reduction Ratio (TRR) which corresponds to the drag reduction) is consistent
with a recent series of experimental measurements performed by Murai et al. (J. Phys. 14
143 (2005)). Our analysis suggests that the physical mechanism for the torque reduction
in this regime is due to the local axial forcing, induced by rising bubbles, that is able to
break the highly dissipative Taylor wavy vortices in the system. We ﬁnally show that the
lift force acting on the bubble is crucial in this process. When neglecting it, the bubbles
preferentially accumulate near the inner cylinder and the bulk ﬂow is less eﬃciently
modiﬁed.

1. Introduction

Drag reduction induced by injection of small concentration of gas bubbles in a liq-
uid ﬂow has been addressed in several physical systems, from turbulent boundary layer
on a ﬂat plate, (Madavan et al. (1984), Ferrante & Elghobashi (2004), Sanders et al.
(2006)), to channel ﬂows, (Xu et al. (2002), Lu et al. (2005)). Despite the eﬀorts ded-
icated to the subject, the problem has not been fully clariﬁed from a fundamental phys-
ical point of view. Diﬀerent mechanisms such as eﬀective compressibility of the ﬂow,
(Ferrante & Elghobashi (2004)), bubble deformability, (Lu et al. (2005)), or compress-
ibility (Lo et al. (2006)), have been proposed as relevant. A misleading aspect of the
drag-reduction problem arises from the fact that, depending on the system considered,
either transient, or spatially dependent (as a function of the bubbles’ injection point),
or statistically steady eﬀects can be observed. To overcome such a diﬃculty, more re-
cently experiments have been conducted in a Taylor-Couette (TC) set-up, (Djeridi et al.

(2004), van den Berg et al. (2005), Murai et al. (2005), van den Berg et al. (2007)). The
TC system has two advantages. First, since it is a closed system, exact global energy
balance relation can be explicitly obtained and drag variations can be evaluated in terms
of a single globally averaged quantity, the torque. Second, statistically stationary states
can be reached easily. In order to quantify the level of drag reduction, it is convenient to
consider the so called Torque Reduction Ratio (TRR) coeﬃcient, viz.

TRR ≡ 1 −

Tb
T

,

(1.1)

where Tb stands for the measured torque in the two-phase system, i.e., with the bubbles
included and T for the torque in the single-phase ﬂow at the same Reynolds number.
In the highly turbulent TC system (Re > 105) drag reduction is mainly attributed to
the bubble deformation mechanism (van den Berg et al. (2005), Lu et al. (2005)) in the
boundary layer (van den Berg et al. (2007)).

Also at moderate ﬂow-Reynolds numbers in the range Re = 600 - 4500 (the so called
wavy/modulate-wavy Taylor vortex regime) Murai et al. (2005) reported that bubble-
induced drag reduction up to 25% can be observed for tiny bubble concentrations, O(1%)
in volume. The experimental apparatus considered by these authors is forced by rotation
of the inner cylinder, while the outer one is kept ﬁxed. The cylindrical enclosure is ﬁlled
by a Silicon oil roughly ﬁve times more viscous than water (ν = 5 · 10−6 m2/s) and
air bubbles are injected into the ﬂuid. Their typical radius is a = 250 - 300 µm and
T σ−1 < 0.6 (where ρ and σ are respectively the density and
Weber number W e ≡ 2aρv2
the surface tension of the oil and vT the bubble terminal velocity in still ﬂuid). The
bubble Reynolds number, based on vT , is Reb = 2a vT /ν ≃ 7. Therefore bubbles can
be regarded with good approximation as mono-disperse non-deformable spheres, whose
scale is of the same order as the smallest scales of ﬂuid ﬂuctuations. The experimental
results of Murai et al. showed that the drag reduction decreases with increasing Reynolds
number. TRR was almost vanishing at Re ≃ 4000 and became negative (drag increase) for
even larger Reynolds numbers. Murai et al. explained this drag reduction eﬀect through
the bubble interaction with the coherent Taylor vortices, producing a vertical elongation
of their arrangement. The features of the Murai et al. experiment, in particular the low
large-scale Re numbers and the small (i.e. limited Reb) non-deformable bubbles employed
there, make this experiment accessible to a direct comparison with numerical simulations,
which we will perform in this paper.

The aim of the present work is to shed more light on the physical mechanism of drag
reduction observed in the Murai et al. experiment, which will turn out to be substantially
diﬀerent from the mechanism that acts in the highly-turbulent conditions explored by
van den Berg et al. (2005, 2007). We use an Eulerian-Lagrangian algorithm, that has
to be regarded as a phenomenological model of the real system, as the bubbly phase
evolution can only be described by an approximate force balance-equation. Nevertheless,
we think that the main ﬂow features and the resulting drag reduction phenomena are
reasonably captured by this approach.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we introduce the geometry and the two-
phase model system used for the numerical study and present a test in order to validate
the code. In section 3 our numerical results on torque modulation in the two-phase ﬂow
and bubble distributions are described and discussed in detail. Section 4 contains com-
ments and conclusions. In the appendix we derive relations connecting globally averaged
quantities in the TC system.

2. Taylor-Couette system and numerical scheme

In the Taylor-Couette system the ﬂuid is enclosed between two coaxially rotating
cylinders with radius Ro and Ri, respectively for the outer and the inner one. The height
of the cylindrical enclosures, denoted with L, is in the vertical direction. We limit our
investigation to the case where only the inner cylinder is rotating at a constant angular
velocity Ω while the outer one is at rest, see ﬁgure 1. Furthermore, no-slip conditions are
assumed at the walls. It is convenient to adopt the Reynolds number based on the inner
cylinder velocity U = RiΩ and the gap width d = (Ro − Ri) as a control parameter, that
is

Re ≡

(Ro − Ri)RiΩ
ν

.

(2.1)

The most signiﬁcant response of the system is the time averaged torque on the inner
cylinder, which is expressed as

(2.2)
where τwi stands for the mean inner-wall shear stress. In cylindrical coordinates (z, r, θ)
the wall shear stress can be computed as

τwi = −ρν

where uθ is the azimuthal velocity component and the over-bar denotes averaging in
space over concentric cylindrical surfaces and time. Note that an analogous expression
for the torque can be written in terms of the outer cylinder, since conservation of angular
momentum implies, ( d
i . At increasing angular velocity
the ﬂow in between the two cylinders experiences several hydrodynamic instabilities. Af-
ter the destabilization of the laminar ﬂow, the formation of horizontal couples of circular
rolls, known as Taylor vortices (Taylor (1923)), is observed. Then, at further increasing
Ω, axis symmetry is lost and one encounters ﬁrst steady wavy, then time modulated rolls,
and ﬁnally a fully developed turbulent regime is established, see Andereck et al. (1986).
The relation linking the torque to the Reynolds number and the gap parameter η =

still an open problem, see Lathrop et al. (1992), Esser & Grossmann (1996), Eckhardt et al.
(2000), Lim & Tan (2004), and Eckhardt et al. (2007). However, the torque can be re-
lated to the mean (time and volume averaged h. . .i) energy dissipation rate hεi, namely
†

hεi =

πρ(R2

Thus hεi and T are directly proportional and a decrease in the torque corresponds to a
reduction of the internal energy dissipation rate in the system. Therefore, the total drag
reduction can be deduced from the variations of a single global observable as the torque.

2.1. The model for the two-phase ﬂow

The direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach we adopt is based on the Eulerian-
Lagrangian algorithm, here in the form used by Mazzitelli et al. (2003a,b). The ﬂuid
phase is described by the Navier-Stokes equation for an incompressible ﬂow (∇ · u = 0).
Bubbles counter-act on the ﬂow by a two-way point-like coupling:

where y(i) denotes the instantaneous position of the i-th bubble and g the gravitational

with τb ≡ a2/(6ν) the characteristic bubble response time, and u and ω denoting re-
spectively the ﬂuid velocity and vorticity vectors at the bubble position. Fully-elastic
boundary conditions are assumed for the bubbles on the cylinder’s lateral walls, while
direct bubble-bubble interactions (4-way coupling) are neglected. It is important to note
that the lift force in (2.8) is only approximate. Here the expression for the rotational
ﬂow in the limit Reb → ∞ is used, corresponding to a lift coeﬃcient CL = 1/2 (Auton
(1987)). However, in the simulation we consider the case of Reb ∼ O(10) in an unsteady
ﬂow for which the Auton’s expression may be incorrect or may overestimate the ac-
tual intensity of the lift force (van Nierop et al. (2007)). Despite the above mentioned
approximations and the simpliﬁed approach of the model adopted, it has been shown
by van den Berg et al. (2006) and Calzavarini et al. (2006), that a qualitative agreement
with real systems occurs. We will further discuss on the eﬀect of the lift on the bubble
dispersion in the TC ﬂow in section 3.4 of this paper.

2.2. Numerical implementation, code validation and tuning of the DNS
The continuous phase, (2.5), has been implemented in cylindrical coordinates on a ﬁnite-
diﬀerence scheme. The grid, Nz × Nr × Nθ = 128 × 64 × 256, is non uniform and reﬁned in
the near-wall regions in the radial direction, while it is uniform both in the vertical and
azimuthal ones. Careful attention has been paid to the implementation of the non-linear
term by the use of an algorithm that enjoys highly-conservative properties for energy,
proposed by Fukagata & Kasagi (2002). The time marching scheme is of second-order
accuracy. The bubble trajectories (2.7)–(2.8) have also been implemented in cylindrical
coordinates as in Djeridi et al. (2004) and integrated by a second-order scheme in time,
while interpolation of ﬂuid velocity at the bubble position is implemented by a third-
order scheme, i.e. taking into account up to the second nearest lattice nodes (64 points).
The feed-back (2.6) is extrapolated from the bubble position to the next nearest nodes
by a tri-linear scheme (8 points). We use periodic boundary conditions in the vertical
direction both for the ﬂuid and the bubbles. Additionally, for the ﬂuid only, we ﬁx the
mean ﬂow in the vertical direction to be zero, in order to avoid the emerging of a mean
axial current that would prevent a realistic comparison with the experiment, where it is
forbidden for geometrical reasons.

The implementation of the single-phase ﬂow dynamics has been validated by measuring
the onset of the ﬁrst instability as well as the dimensionless torque G = T /(ρν2L) at
diﬀerent Reynolds numbers and for diﬀerent values of the gap ratio η. The results were
compared with the empirical law given by Wendt (1933) (also in Lathrop et al. (1992)),
see ﬁgure 2, which displays satisfactory agreement.

The tuning of our DNS with the experimental setup adopted by Murai et al. is then
done as follows. The experimental apparatus is geometrically characterized by a gap
ratio η = 5/6 and an aspect ratio Γ = L/d = 20, see ﬁgure 1 of Murai et al. (2005) for a
sketch of their setup. The ﬂow boundaries adopted in the experiment on the horizontal

surfaces are free ﬂuid surface (free-slip) at the top and zero mass-ﬂux at the bottom.
Since we do not expect drag to be strongly aﬀected by the inﬂuence of the top/bottom
boundary conditions, particularly for aspect ratio values (Γ) much larger than one, we
use, for simplicity and in order to limit the computational costs a smaller aspect ratio
Γ/d = 8 than in experiment, and periodic boundary conditions as mentioned before. The
gap ratio is as in the experiment, η = 5/6. Furthermore, for the whole set of numerical
simulation we ﬁx the ratio a/d and the bubble Reynolds number Reb to the experimental
values - both these quantities are not Reynolds dependent in the experiment - and we
vary the ﬂuid Reynolds number Re, by changing the inner cylinder rotational speed Ω
as in the experimental setup, in the range Re = 600-2500. Care has to be put on the
tuning of the void fraction, since in the experiment it was not kept constant among the
diﬀerent runs but estimated a posteriori through a measure of the total gas ﬂow rate. We
choose α0 consistently with the experiment. The values (table 1) are obtained by a ﬁt to
the estimated experimental void fraction (see also Oiwa (2005), chapter 5); this explains
some tiny deviations among the two cases. For the ﬂow conditions that we consider for
the comparison, i.e. Re 6 2500, α0 is always less than 1%. The value of the ratio a/d

3.1. Overview
In this section we present the comparison of numerical and experimental results. In
ﬁgure 3 we show both the TRR coeﬃcient obtained from the experiment and from the
simulations. In the inset TRR is normalized by the total void fraction (this ratio is called
sensitivity by Murai et al. (2005)). The quantitative agreement on this observable is
satisfactory. First, we detect a robust (up to 20%) statistically steady drag reduction.
Second, drag reduction eﬀect has a decreasing trend at increasing the Reynolds number.

maximum deviation from equi-distribution is about 100% of the homogeneous case and
is peaked both at the inner and the outer wall. On the other hand, in the experiment,
where radial mean void fraction has been evaluated by averaging over a series of snapshots
taken in the upper part of the TC system, a much stronger accumulation peaked near
the inner cylinder is found and it reaches much larger values (roughly 4 times larger than
in numerics in the most extreme case Re = 600). Nevertheless, the same trend towards
homogenization at increasing Reynolds number is observed in both cases. The possible
origin of this discrepancy and its relevance on the eﬀect of drag reduction will be further
discussed in detail and will be the focus of section 3.4.

3.2. Origin of the drag reduction

The variation of the intensity of the torque in the TC system is directly connected to a
change in the mean azimuthal velocity proﬁle along the radial direction uθ(r), see (2.2)–
(2.3). Figure 5 (top) shows the actual modiﬁcation of the two-phase proﬁle compared to
the single-phase at two diﬀerent Reynolds numbers, Re = 900 and Re = 2000. These Re
values will be adopted as reference cases in the following discussion. A smoother slope
is observed in ﬁgure 5 for the gradient at the wall of uθ(r) in the two-phase case. As
consequence the torque is reduced. We also note that the torque Tb for the two phase
system, when normalized by the torque Tl = ρΩ2R4
i L/(η(1 + η)Re) in the (single-phase)
laminar regime, satisﬁes the following relation (derived in the appendix):

where uruθ(r) is the azimuthal-radial component of the mean Reynolds shear stress
and fb,θ(r) the mean azimuthal component of bubble forcing. Relation (3.1) reveals the
connection between the Reynolds shear stress, the bubble forcing, and the torque. We
have tested that in the two-phase case the mean bubble forcing fb is mainly dominated
by the vertical component, see ﬁgure 6. Therefore in the relation (3.1) the contribution
coming from fb,θ(r) is negligible compared to the Reynolds shear stress and the measure of
uruθ(r) is a direct way to appreciate the variations in the mean ﬂow features responsible
for a torque change. As shown in ﬁgure 5 (bottom), this variation appears to be relevant
in the whole bulk of the system and is approximately constant through it, both at large
and small Reynolds numbers.

We also have previously observed that in the relative low Reynolds range under con-
sideration, coherent ﬂow structures in the form of Taylor vortices are persistent in the
ﬂow. To reveal the eﬀect of the interaction of the dispersed bubbly phase with the co-
herent ﬂow structures, we present a visualization of the ﬂow. Figure 7 shows snapshots
from two simulations respectively at Re = 900 and Re = 2000, both in the single-phase
and in two-phase case. Vortical structures are identiﬁed by iso-surfaces of the second
invariant of the velocity gradient tensor and are shown in a uniform color accordingly to
the sign of the azimuthal component of the local vorticity ﬁeld, ωθ (Hunt et al. (1988),
Tanahashi et al. (2001)). The intensity of the inner-shear stress, τwi, is also reproduced
in colors in the ﬁgure. Vortical Taylor structures, that come in counter-rotating pairs, are
well captured by this visualization method. In both cases it is evident how the addiction
of microbubbles eﬃciently breaks the self organized order established by the system in
the single-phase condition. We do not observe elongation of Taylor vortex couples as no-
ticed by Murai et al. (2005). Therefore we associate the observed reduction of the mean
drag to the breaking of coherent ﬂow structures.

3.3. Explanation for TRR decrease at increasing Re

We now want to address the second of our questions, namely, why the drag reduction
becomes less and less at increasing the inner cylinder rotational speed. Therefore we
look at the global energy balance relation for the torque in the two-phase ﬂow (see the

The second equation (3.3) follows from relation (2.4). TRR= 1 − Tb/T is thus composed
of the sum of the two terms 1 − hεbi/hεi and hfb · ui/hεi, which are here both of im-
portance. While the former is associated to changes of the dissipative structures in the
system, the latter is associated to the extra energy input in the system due to the bubble
momentum transfer. Both these terms are positive (i.e., contribute to the drag reduc-
tion). Furthermore, the 1 − hεbi/hεi term is dominant at all Re, see ﬁgure 8. This means
that the bubbly phase, that breaks vortical dissipation regions, modiﬁes the energy ﬂux
directed from the large-scale of the external forcing (due to the rotating cylinder) to the
dissipative scale.

Both contributions 1 − hεbi/hεi and hfb · ui/hεi to TRR are vanishing at increasing
Re. How to explain this dependence? We note that hfb · ui, the correlation term of

bubble forcing with velocity ﬂuctuations, can be positive for two diﬀerent reasons. First,
the bubbles might distribute preferentially in regions where the velocity is up-ﬂow as
compared to the mean. This would produce a positive correlation with the term −g that
is the dominant one in the bubble feed-back fb. The second possibility is that bubbles may
induce a local up-ﬂow ﬂuctuation in the surrounding ﬂuid that is larger as compared to
the underlying ﬂow ﬂuctuation. This would produce always a positive correlation with the
gravity term −g. The latter mechanism, where the bubble perturbation is overwhelming,
is similar to what happens in a system where bubbles are rising in an otherwise quiescent
ﬂuid. Therefore, we will call this type of dynamics pseudo-turbulent.

To distinguish between this two possibilities, we make a numerical test by switching-oﬀ
the two-way coupling, i.e., fb = 0. Also in this one-way coupling case bubbles distribute
inhomogeneously. In particular, we expect that the bubble distribution in the two-way
and one-way coupling cases shares similar properties if the amplitude of ﬂuid ﬂuctuations
compared to the bubble feed-back is strong enough, while we expect them to have diﬀerent
properties if the pseudo-turbulence mechanism holds. The evaluation of the quantity
huzib, where h. . .ib denotes the average on the bubble centroids, allows to discriminate

ﬁeld has been already observed numerically by Mazzitelli et al. (2003a) for the case of
active bubble in a strong turbulent bulk ﬂow. Here in the low Re case instead bubbles
strongly modify the ﬂow by producing an upward ﬂow in the position where they are. The
pseudo-turbulent mechanism must become less eﬀective at large Re numbers because of
the increased level of ﬂuid ﬂuctuations. This is conﬁrmed by the measure of the intensity
of the vertical anisotropic energy content in the system, ﬁgure 10. Vertical anisotropy

To summarize, the mainly vertical extra-forcing exerted by the bubbles on the ﬂuid is
responsible for local and anisotropic modiﬁcations of the ﬂuid ﬂuctuations. No large-scale
ﬂow mechanism induced by bubbles seems to be present or relevant in this process. At
increased external forcing (larger Re), the eﬃciency of the bubbles in perturbing the ﬂow
is lost.

3.4. Bubble distribution

Inhomogeneous bubble distribution in the TC system is due to the concurrence of several
competing factors: (i) the centrifugal force, whose intensity towards the inner wall is
proportional to −u2
θ/r; (ii) inertia that pushes the bubbles towards the local vortical
ﬂow structures (Wang & Maxey (1993)); (iii) the drift towards the walls, that is a lift
eﬀect due to the presence of a local mean shear (Serizawa et al. (1975)); and ﬁnally, (iv)
the pseudo-turbulence ﬂow ﬂuctuations which may produce a weak side by side bubble-

Figure 11. Normalized radial mean void fraction at Re = 600. Here a comparison of the
numerical results with and without lift force are shown, together with the experimental proﬁles
reported in Murai et al. (2005). In the case without lift, all the bubbles collapse into the ﬁrst
compartment of the histogram, giving a sharp bubble concentrations whose peak has been
truncated for better readability.

bubble attraction (Zenit et al. (2001), Bunner & Tryggvason (2002)). All these eﬀects are
included explicitly, or via the bubble-ﬂow interactions, in the numerical model system.

Discriminating among the factors is diﬃcult. For simplicity we limit our investigation to
the radial dependence of mean bubble concentration proﬁles. The formation of vertical
columnar or spiraling structures, similarly to the ones experimentally investigated by
Shiomi et al. (1993), are indeed observed in our numerics, but this will not be the focus
of this section. Already from numerical results reported in ﬁgure 4 we have observed that
at low Re numbers bubbles accumulation at both walls is observed, while at large Re a
weak tendency of accumulation in the core is noticeable. Since in the low Re condition the
drag behavior is dominated by pseudo-turbulence, we attribute near-wall accumulation to
the bubble-wall interaction due to the lift in our numerical simulations. More explicitly,
the local vertical mean ﬂow produced by the bubble coupling is constrained by the no-
slip conditions at the walls. This local up-ﬂow proﬁle, as in an up-ﬂow vertical pipe
(Serizawa et al. (1975)), induce a lateral (lift-driven) migration to the walls. Indeed this
is evident if we switch oﬀ the lift force. Without lift all the bubbles collapse on the inner
cylinder due to the centripetal force, see ﬁgure 11. At large Re the pseudo-turbulent
eﬀect is less eﬃcient and the bubbles tend to accumulate in vortex core regions: inertia
plays the dominant role. Figure 11 also shows a comparison at Re = 600 with the
bubble concentration proﬁle measured in the experiment. As noted previously, in the
experimental proﬁles the local void fraction is always peaked near to the inner cylinder,
in contrast to what is found in the simulations.

What are the main reason for this discrepancy? First, the diﬀerence in statistically
stationarity of the bubbly phase distribution. In the numerics the bubbles are injected
statistically homogeneously into the ﬂuid domain and a long time is required until sta-
tistically stationarity for the bubbles distribution is reached, since the bubbles can recir-
culate in the ﬂow several large-eddy-turnover times due to periodic boundary conditions.
In Murai’s et al. experiment the situation is rather diﬀerent. Bubbles are injected from
the bottom. The injection sites are close to the inner cylinder walls. The bubbles emerge
to the free surface at the top after traveling across the cylindrical enclosure, whose aspect
ratio is much larger than in the simulation (cfr. the Γ values in table 1). It is ﬁnally on the

top TC section that the radial mean void fraction is measured. It could be that under the
particular conditions of slow rotation of the inner cylinder (low Re) stationarity is not
fully achieved in the experimental set-up, since the bubbles rise almost vertically. This
seems to be supported by some experimental snapshots in Murai et al. (2005), see ﬁgure 8
of that paper and the corresponding discussion. Furthermore, bubble-bubble coalescence
may sporadically occur in the experiment. Coalesced bubbles, which rise faster than the
others, lead to the formation of clusters and may delay or prevent the bubble distributions
to become statistically stationary (Y. Murai 2007, personal communication).

Second, on the numerical side, a possible source for the observed discrepancy may lie
in the incompleteness of the model adopted for the lift force that may overestimate its
relevance. It has been shown (Magnaudet & Legendre (1998)) that for non-deformable
bubbles, whose Reynolds number (Reb) is larger than one, and in a pure shear ﬂow the lift
coeﬃcient can be considerably smaller than the asymptotic value, CL = 1/2. Similar ﬁnd-
ings for the lift coeﬃcient have experimentally been obtained by van Nierop et al. (2007).
Moreover, CL depends on the local shear and the local vorticity. In order to understand
how robust the shape of the mean bubble concentration proﬁle is when changing the lift
coeﬃcient CL, we have performed a test at the lowest Reynolds number (Re = 600),
where the eﬀect of bubble accumulation on the wall is more intense. CL has been varied
in the interval [0, 0.5] for a set of numerical runs all starting from the same initial condi-
tion and extended until statistically stationarity in time is reached. As shown in ﬁgure
12, it turns out that the bubbly mean concentration is rather sensitive to CL. For the
cases with CL 6 0.1 it exhibits a single wall-peak near the inner wall. This also implies a
dependence on the bubble feed-back on the ﬂuid. As reported in ﬁgure 12 (inset), reduc-
ing the lift coeﬃcient progressively from CL = 0.5 to zero corresponds to a reduction in
TRR. In particular, the accumulation of a small volume concentration of bubbles (here
α0 = 0.125%) on the surface of the inner cylinder, as for the cases CL = 0 and CL = 0.1,
would have almost no eﬀect on the torque (or drag) modulation.

4. Conclusions

We have numerically investigated the eﬀect of micro-bubbles on a Taylor Couette
(TC) ﬂow in the wavy vortex ﬂow regime and focused on a comparison with a speciﬁc
experiment where variations in the drag have been observed. We demonstrated that this
phenomenon is reproduced by an Eulerian-Lagrangian model with point-force coupling.
The main eﬀect of microbubbles is to create a local perturbation of the ﬂow, mainly
directed upwards along the vertical direction that is able to break the coherent, and
mainly dissipative, vortical structures of the ﬂow. This pseudo-turbulent mechanism is at
the origin of the torque reduction in the TC ﬂow regime considered here. As a consequence
at large Reynolds number (Re), where the typical ﬂuid velocity ﬂuctuations are larger and
coherent structures are unsteady and less persistent, this mechanism loses its eﬃciency.
The lift force resulted to be particularly important in this process. The strength of the
lift force is the main factor for the bubble mean concentration proﬁles. Furthermore, the
drag reduction is particularly sensitive to it. When suppressing the lift, almost no drag
reduction is obtained.

The dynamics responsible for the drag reduction in the low Re TC ﬂow highlighted
in this study is fundamentally diﬀerent from the one that has been observed in previous
highly turbulent experimental investigations by van den Berg et al. (2005, 2007). From
our numerics it can be extrapolated that small non-deformable bubbles (zero Weber
number (W e)), whose size is always below the smallest typical scale of the ﬂow will be
of less and less importance for drag reduction as the external forcing (and hence Re)
is increased. This is also consistent with the theory developed by L’vov et al. (2005),
where for small bubble in a channel ﬂow the variation of the drag expected are only
of the order of the void fraction. This suggests that at larger Re, when W e > 1 (as in
van den Berg et al. (2005, 2007)), other physical mechanisms shall be eﬀective, namely,
bubble deformation (Lu et al. (2005)) or compression (Lo et al. (2006)). Further joint
numerical and experimental works are still needed to clarify this aspect.

Appendix A.

In this appendix we present a derivation of the equations (3.1) and (3.2), based on the
use of the reciprocal theorem (Happel & Brenner (1973)). Let us introduce two incom-
pressible velocity ﬁelds u and ˜u, both satisfying the same set of boundary conditions.
We identify u as the real ﬂow in the TC system, and ˜u as a particular ﬂow ﬁeld, that
will be speciﬁed afterwards. We focus here on the axially periodic TC system with only
rotating inner cylinder. Therefore, the wall boundary conditions are the following:

u = ˜u = RiΩeθ
u = ˜u = 0

by

where σ is the stress tensor associated to u and er and eθ are unit vectors in the radial
and azimuthal directions, respectively. Using the boundary conditions (A 1) for ˜u, we can

From equation (A 4) and (A 6) the relevant relations (3.1) and (3.2) can readily be ob-

ﬁeld u, (ii) ˜u is the steady ﬂow ﬁeld solution of the Stokes equation for the TC system.

Case (i): If we choose the ﬁeld (˜u, ˜σ) to be (u, σ), the product (σ : ∇˜u) is equal to the

a pressure driven channel and circular pipe ﬂows. The Fukagata et al. identity has been
further extended to the problem of channel ﬂow with mixed boundary by using the
reciprocal theorem in Sbragaglia & Sugiyama (2007). Our derivation presented above
represents an extension of that work to the TC system.

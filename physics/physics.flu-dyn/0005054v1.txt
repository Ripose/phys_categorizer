ABSTRACT

This paper concentrates on the ﬂow prop-
erties when one ﬂuid displaces another ﬂuid
in a two-dimensional (2D) network of pores
and throats. We consider the scale where
individual pores enter the description and
we use a network model to simulate the dis-
placement process.

We study the interplay between the pres-
sure build up in the ﬂuids and the dis-
placement structure in drainage. We ﬁnd
that our network model properly describes
the pressure buildup due to capillary and
viscous forces and that there is good cor-
respondence between the simulated evolu-
tion of the ﬂuid pressures and earlier results
from experiments and simulations in slow
drainage.

We investigate the burst dynamics in
drainage going from low to high injection
rate at various ﬂuid viscosities. The bursts
are identiﬁed as pressure drops in the pres-
sure signal across the system. We ﬁnd that
the statistical distribution of pressure drops
scales according to other systems exhibiting
self-organized criticality. We compare our
results to corresponding experiments.

We also study the stabilization mecha-
nisms of the invasion front in horizontal 2D
drainage. We focus on the process when
the front stabilizes due to the viscous forces
in the liquids. We ﬁnd that the diﬀerence
in capillary pressure between two diﬀerent
points along the front varies almost linearly
as function of length separation in the di-
rection of the displacement. The numer-
ical results support new arguments about
the displacement process from those earlier
suggested for viscous stabilization. Our ar-
guments are based on the observation that

nonwetting ﬂuid ﬂows in loopless strands
(paths) and we conclude that earlier sug-
gested theories are not suitable to drainage
when nonwetting strands dominate the dis-
placement process. We also show that the
arguments might inﬂuence the scaling be-
havior of the front width as function of the
injection rate and compare some of our re-
sults to experimental work.

1 INTRODUCTION

Two-phase displacements in porous media
have received much attention during the
last two decades.
In modern physics, the
process is of great interest due to the variety
of structures obtained when changing the
ﬂuid properties like wettability, interfacial
tension, viscosities and displacement rate.
The diﬀerent structures obtained have been
organized into three ﬂow regimes: viscous
ﬁngering [1, 2], stable displacement [3], and
capillary ﬁngering [4–6]. Viscous ﬁngering
is characterized by an unstable front of ﬁn-
gers that is generated when nonwetting and
less viscous ﬂuid is displacing wetting and
more viscous ﬂuid at relative high injection
rate. The ﬁngering structure is found to
be fractal with fractal dimension D = 1.62
[1, 2]. Stable displacement is named after
the relative ﬂat and stable front that is be-
ing generated when a nonwetting and more
viscous ﬂuid displaces a wetting and less
viscous ﬂuid at relative high injection rate.
The last scenario, capillary ﬁngering, is ob-
tained when a nonwetting ﬂuid very slowly
displaces a wetting ﬂuid. At suﬃciently low
injection rate the invasion ﬂuid generates
a pattern similar to the cluster formed by
invasion percolation [4, 7–9]. The displace-

1

ment is now solely controlled by the capil-
lary pressure, that is the pressure diﬀerence
between the two ﬂuids across a meniscus in
a pore.

Fluid ﬂow in porous media has also been
intensively studied because of
important
applications in a wide range of diﬀerent
technologies. The most important areas
that to a great extent depend on proper-
ties of ﬂuid ﬂow in porous media, are oil
recovery and hydrology.
In oil recovery,
petroleum engineers are continuously de-
volving improved techniques to increase the
amount of oil they are able to achieve from
the oil reservoirs. In hydrology, one impor-
tant concern is often to avoid pollution of
ground water from human activity.

The simulation model presented in this
paper is developed to study the dynamics of
the temporal evolution of the ﬂuid pressures
when a nonwetting ﬂuid displaces a wetting
ﬂuid at constant injection rate. With the
model we study the pressure in the ﬂuids
caused by the viscous forces as well as the
capillary forces due to the menisci in the
pores. The model porous medium consists
of a tube network where the tubes are con-
nected together to form a square lattice.

Numerical simulations of ﬂuid ﬂow in
porous media using a network of tubes
was ﬁrst proposed by Fatt [10]
in 1956.
Since then a large number of publications
related to network models and pore-scale
displacements have appeared in the litera-
ture [1, 3, 11–23]. Often mentioned is the
classic work of Lenormand et al. [3] who
were the ﬁrst to systematically classify the
displacement structures into the three ﬂow
regimes: viscous ﬁngering, stable displace-
ment and capillary ﬁngering. Including the
work of Lenormand et al., it appears that

most network models have been used to
study statistical properties of the displace-
ment structures or to calculate macroscopic
properties like ﬂuid saturations and relative
permeabilities.

There have been several attempts to sim-
ulate the displacement process by using
diﬀerent types of growth algorithms.
In
1983 Wilkinson and Willemsen [9] formu-
lated a new form of percolation theory, in-
vasion percolation (IP), that corresponds to
slow drainage, i.e. capillary ﬁngering.
In
1984 Paterson [24] was the ﬁrst to discover
the remarkable parallels between diﬀusion-
limited aggregation (DLA) [25] and viscous
ﬁngering. He also showed similarities be-
tween anti-DLA and stable displacement.
The disadvantage with the growth algo-
rithms is that they do not contain any phys-
ical time and they have so far not been suit-
able to study the cross over between the
diﬀerent ﬂow regimes. However, attempts
have been made to use DLA and IP to study
dynamics of viscous ﬁngering [26] and slow
drainage [27, 28], respectively.

In slow drainage it is observed that the
invasion of nonwetting ﬂuid occurs in a se-
ries of bursts accompanied by sudden neg-
ative drops in the pressure called Haines
jumps [27–29] (see Fig. 1). This type of dy-
namics is very important for the temporal
evolution of the pressure in drainage, and in
most network models the eﬀect is neglected.
Consequently, only very few network mod-
els [21] have been used to study the inter-
play between ﬂuid pressures and displace-
ment structures, and many questions ad-
dressing this topic are still open. We will
attempt to answer some of them in this
paper, by making a model whose proper-
ties are closer to those of real porous me-

Pore neck

Figure 1: Nonwetting ﬂuid (white) invades
a 2D porous medium initially ﬁlled with
wetting ﬂuid (shaded). As the nonwetting
ﬂuid is pumped into the system (a) the
menisci move into narrower parts of the
pore necks and the capillary pressure in-
creases (b). During a burst the invading
ﬂuid covers new pores and the neighbor-
ing menisci readjust back to larger radii and
the capillary pressure decreases everywhere

pore neck having a shape of an hourglass.

dia. To model the burst dynamics, we have
been motivated by the hourglass shaped
pore necks in Fig. 1. As a result we let
the tubes in our network model behave as if
they were hourglass shaped with respect to
the capillary pressure. Thus, the capillary
pressure of a meniscus starts at zero when
the meniscus enters the tube and increases
towards a maximum value at the middle of
the tube where the tube is most narrow, be-
fore the capillary pressure decreases to zero
again when the meniscus leave the tube.

The advantage of the above approach is
a network model that reproduces the burst
dynamics and the corresponding pressure
evolution. We are also able to study in de-
tail the capillary pressure of each meniscus
along the front as it moves through the net-
work. Similar measurements can hardly be
done experimentally.

We use the model to study the burst dy-
namics going from low to high displacement
rates. To do so, we examine the statistical
properties of the sudden negative pressure
drops due to bursts. We ﬁnd that for a
wide range of displacement rates and ﬂuid
viscosities, the pressure drops act in anal-
ogy to theoretical predictions of systems
exhibiting self-organized criticality, such as
IP. Even at high injection rates, where the
connection between the displacement pro-
cess and IP is more open, the pressure drops
behave similar to the case of extreme low
injection rate, where IP apply.

Further, we report on the behavior of
the capillary pressure along the invasion
front and investigate the stabilization mech-
anisms of horizontal drainage. We present
theoretical arguments predicting the behav-
ior of the pressure along the front, and we
conclude that the diﬀerence in pressure be-
tween two diﬀerent points along the front
should depend almost linearly as function of
the distance between the two points in the
direction of the displacement. The theoret-
ical arguments are based on the observation
that the nonwetting ﬂuid displaces the wet-
ting ﬂuid through separate loopless strands
(paths). Numerical simulations of the cap-
illary pressure along the front supports the
theoretical arguments. We note that earlier
suggested views [30–33] concerning the be-
havior of the pressure along the front, is not
compatible with our results.

Unfortunately, the detailed modeling of
the menisci’s movements and their capillary
pressures makes the model computationally
heavy and reduces the system size that is
attainable within feasible amount of CPU
time.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec-

3

tion 2 we present the network model and
describe brieﬂy its numerical implementa-
tion. The rest of the sections discuss the
main results that we have got from numer-
ical experiments with the network model.
In section 3 we discuss the evolution of the
simulated pressure in drainage and calcu-
late the statistics of the bursts. We also
compare some of our results to experimental
work. Section 4 presents theoretical argu-
ments about the stabilization mechanisms
of the front in drainage. The arguments are
supported by numerical simulations with
the network model. This section also con-
tains experimental work that is related to
the numerical simulations. A summary of
the results and concluding remarks are pro-
vided in Section 5.

2 SIMULATION

MODEL

The network model is thoroughly discussed
in Ref. [34], and it has also been presented
brieﬂy in Refs. [35, 36]. Therefore, only its
main features are described in this section.
The model porous medium consists of a
square lattice of cylindrical tubes of length
d oriented at 45◦ to the longest side of the
lattice. Four tubes meet at each intersec-
tion where we put a node having no volume.
The disorder is introduced by (1) assigning
the tubes a radius r chosen at random inside
the interval [λ1d, λ2d] where 0 ≤ λ1 < λ2 ≤ 1
or (2) moving the intersections a randomly
chosen distance away from their initial po-
sitions. The randomly chosen distances are
less than 1/2 of the distance between the
nearest neighbor intersections to avoid over-

Figure 2: Example of a displacement struc-
ture from one simulation. The nonwetting
ﬂuid (black) is injected from below and dis-
places the wetting ﬂuid (grey) that escapes
along the top row. The front between the
nonwetting and wetting phase is deﬁned
as the line separating the compact wetting
phase and the nonwetting ﬂuid. Note the
trapped regions of wetting ﬂuid that are left
behind and surround by nonwetting ﬂuid.

lapping nodes. In (1) all tubes have equal
d but diﬀerent r. (2) results in a distorted
square lattice giving the tubes diﬀerent d’s.
In (2) r = d/2α where α is the aspect ra-
tio between the tube length and its radius.
The reason for making a distorted lattice of
tubes is to get closer to a real pore-throat
geometry as shown in Fig. 1 [36].

Figure 2 shows an example of a displace-
ment structure that is obtained from one
simulation. The nonwetting ﬂuid (black)
of viscosity µnw is injected along the in-
let (bottom row) and displaces the wetting
ﬂuid (grey) of viscosity µw. The ﬂuids ﬂow
from the bottom to the top of the lattice,
and there are periodical boundary condi-
tions in the orthogonal direction. We as-

4

sume that the ﬂuids are immiscible and in-
compressible.

A meniscus is located in the tubes where
nonwetting and wetting ﬂuids meet. The
capillary pressure pc of a meniscus in a
cylindrical tube of radius r is given by
Young-Laplace law,

lindrical tubes and the Washburn approxi-
mation [37] for menisci under motion. Let
qij denote the volume ﬂux through the tube
from the ith to the jth node, then we have

qij = −

under the assumption that the principal
radii of the curvature of the meniscus are
equal to the radius of the tube. θ denotes
the wetting angle between the cylinder wall
and the wetting ﬂuid, i.e. 0◦ ≤ θ < 90◦ in
drainage.

In the network model we treat the tubes
as if they were hourglass shaped with re-
spect to the capillary pressure. Therefore,
we let the capillary pressure depend on
where the meniscus is situated in the tube.
Instead of Eq. (1) we let pc of a meniscus
vary in the following way:

pc =

r h1 − cos(cid:16)2π

d(cid:17)i .

(2)

Here we have assumed that the wetting ﬂuid
perfectly wets the medium, i.e. θ = 0. In
the above relation x denotes the position of
the meniscus in the tube (0 ≤ x ≤ d), giv-
ing that pc = 0 at the entrance and at the
exit of the tube and reaches a maximum of
4γ/r in the middle of the tube (x = d/2).
Practically, the wetting angle of a meniscus
and thereby its capillary pressure may gen-
erally be diﬀerent depending on whether the
meniscus retires from or invades the tube.
To avoid numerical complications this eﬀect
is neglected in the present model.

of the tube. µij denotes the eﬀective vis-
cosity, that is the sum of the volume frac-
tions of each ﬂuid inside the tube multiplied
by their respective viscosities. The pres-
sure drop across the tube is ∆pij = pj − pi,
where pi and pj is the pressures at node i
and j, respectively. The capillary pressure
pc,ij is the sum of the capillary pressures
of each menisci [given by Eq. (2)] that are
present inside the tube. A tube partially
ﬁlled with both liquids is allowed to con-
tain at maximum two menisci. For a tube
without menisci, pc,ij = 0. We only con-
sider horizontal ﬂow, and therefore we ne-
glect gravity.

We have conservation of volume ﬂux at

each node giving

qij = 0.

(4)

The summation on j runs over the near-
est neighbor nodes to the ith node while i
runs over all nodes that do not belong to
the top or bottom rows, that is, the inter-
nal nodes. Eqs. (3) and (4) constitute a set
of linear equations which we solve for the
nodal pressures pi, with the constraint that
the pressures at the nodes belonging to the
upper and lower rows are kept ﬁxed. The
set of equations is solved by using the Con-
jugate Gradient method [38].

5

In the simulations we impose the injec-
tion rate Q on the inlet, therefore we have
to ﬁnd the pressure across the lattice ∆P ,
that corresponds to the given Q. Having
found ∆P we use this pressure to calculate
the correct pi’s in Eq. (3). In short, we ﬁnd
∆P by considering the relation

Q = A∆P + B.

(5)

The ﬁrst part of Eq. (5) results from Darcy’s
law for single phase ﬂow through porous
media. The second part comes from the
capillary pressure between the two ﬂuids
(i.e. B = 0 if no menisci are present in the
network). Eq. (5) has two unknowns, A and
B, which we calculate by solving Eq. (4)
twice for two diﬀerent applied pressures
∆P ′ and ∆P ′′, across the lattice. From
those two solutions we ﬁnd the correspond-
ing injection rates Q′ and Q′′.
Inserting
Q′, Q′′, ∆P ′, and ∆P ′′ into Eq. (5) results
in two equations which we solve for A and
B. Finally, we ﬁnd the correct ∆P due to
the imposed Q by rewriting Eq. (5), giving
∆P = (Q − B)/A. See Refs. [34,35] for fur-
ther details on how the pi’s are calculated
after ∆P is found.

Given the correct solution of pi we calcu-
late the volume ﬂux qij through each tube
in the lattice, using Eq. (3). Having found
the qij’s, we deﬁne a time step ∆t such that
every meniscus is allowed to travel at most
a maximum step length ∆xmax during that
time step. Each meniscus is moved a dis-
tance (qij/σij)∆t and the total time lapse
is recorded before the nodal pressures pi,
are solved for the new ﬂuid conﬁguration.
Menisci that are moved out of a tube dur-
ing a time step are spread into neighboring
tubes as described in Refs. [34, 35].

EVO-
LUTION OF FLUID
PRESSURE

To characterize the diﬀerent ﬂuid properties
used in the simulations, we use the capil-
lary number Ca and the viscosity ratio M.
The capillary number indicates the ratio be-
tween viscous and capillary forces and in
the simulations it is deﬁned as

Ca ≡

Qµ
Σγ

.

(6)

Here Q is the injection rate of the nonwet-
ting ﬂuid, µ is the maximum viscosity of
the nonwetting and wetting ﬂuid and Σ is
equal to the length of the inlet times the
average thickness of the lattice, i.e. Σ is the
cross section of the inlet. γ is the ﬂuid-ﬂuid
interface tension.

The viscosity ratio M, is deﬁned as

M ≡

µnw
µw

,

(7)

where µnw and µw is the viscosity of the
invading nonwetting ﬂuid and the defending
wetting ﬂuid, respectively.

the trapped wetting ﬂuid (cluster menisci)
and the capillary pressures of the menisci
along the invasion front (front menisci) (see
Fig. 2).

Figure 3 shows the simulated pressures
∆P and Pcg for a displacement at Ca =
4.6×10−3 and M = 100. The front width
was observed to stabilize after some time ts,
and a typical compact pattern of small clus-
ters of wetting ﬂuid developed behind the
front. From Fig. 3 we observe that both ∆P
and Pcg increases as the more viscous ﬂuid
is pumped into the system. When t > ts
they even tend to increase linearly as func-
tion of time.

The driving mechanism in the displace-
ment is the pressure gradient between the
inlet and the front causing a viscous drag
on the trapped clusters. At moderate in-
jection rates these clusters are immobile,
thus the viscous drag is balanced by capil-

lary forces along the interface of the cluster.
On average the sum of the capillary forces
from each cluster contributes to Pcg by a
certain amount making Pcg proportional to
the number of clusters behind the front. Af-
ter the front has saturated with fully devel-
oped clusters behind (t > ts), the number
of clusters are expected to increase linearly
with the amount of injected ﬂuid. Since
the injection rate is held ﬁxed we recognize
that Pcg must increase linearly as function
of time. The argument does not apply when
t < ts, due to the fractal development of the
front before saturation.

In Fig. 3 we have also plotted A0/A which
is the normalized diﬀerence between ∆P
and Pcg [see Eq. (8)]. A0 is equal to the
proportionality factor between Q and ∆P
when only one phase ﬂows through the lat-
tice (i.e. Pcg = 0). We observe that A0/A
tends to increase linearly as function of time
when t > ts. From Eq. (5) we interpret
A as the total conductance of the lattice,
and the reciprocal of that is the total re-
sistance. The total resistance depends on
the ﬂuid conﬁguration and the geometry
of the network. Locally, the ﬂuid conﬁg-
uration changes as nonwetting ﬂuid invades
the system, however, the linear behavior
of A0/A indicates that the overall displace-
ment structure is statistically invariant with
respect to the injection time. That means,
after the front has saturated (t > ts) the
displacement structure might be assigned a
constant resistance per unit length.

In the special case when M = 1 (vis-
cosity matched ﬂuids) the total resistance,
1/A, was found to be constant indepen-
dent of the injection rate or displacement
structure. This somewhat surprising result
might be explained by the following con-

sideration. When M = 1 the eﬀective vis-
cosity µij, of each tube is independent of
the amount of wetting and nonwetting ﬂuid
that occupies the tube. Hence, each tube
has a constant mobility of kij/µij giving a
constant total resistance of the network.

At low Ca we approach the regime of
capillary ﬁngering and the viscous drag on
the clusters becomes negligible. Hence, Pcg
is no longer a linear function of the in-
jection time, but reduces to that describ-
ing the capillary pressure along the front.
This is observed in Fig. 4 where we com-
pare Pcg with the calculated average cap-
illary pressure along the front, Pcf .
In
the simulations, Pcf is calculated by taking
the mean of the capillary pressures of the
front menisci. From the ﬁgure we see that
Pcg ≃ Pcf , as expected. The big jumps in
the pressure functions in Fig. 4 are caused
by the variations in the capillary pressure

as menisci move through the “hourglass”
shaped tubes. The negative jumps are iden-
tiﬁed as bursts where a meniscus proceeds
abruptly [27, 29] to ﬁll the tube with non-
wetting ﬂuid (see also Sec. 3.2 for further
details).

From the above discussion we conclude
that the behavior of Pcg at large times (t >
ts) may be formulated as

Pcg = ∆mch + Pmf ,

(9)

where ∆mc is the proportionality factor be-
tween Pcg and the average front position h
above the inlet. ∆mc is given by the viscous
drag on the clusters and Pmf is the variation
in the capillary pressure when the invasion
front covers new tubes. h is only deﬁned af-
ter the front has saturated, i.e. hs < h < L,
where hs is the average front position at ts
and L is the length of the system. Since the
injection rate is held ﬁxed, h is proportional
to the injection time t. In the limit of very
low injection rates, ∆mc → 0.

When the average front position has
reached the outlet, i.e. h = L in Eq. (9),
only invading ﬂuid ﬂows through the sys-
tem and Pmf = 0. In this limit Darcy’s law
applied on the nonwetting phase gives U =
(Ke/µnw)(∆P/L), where Ke is the eﬀec-
tive permeability of the nonwetting phase.
From Eqs. (8) and (9) we ﬁnd that ∆P =
Q/A+ ∆mcL, which inserted into the Darcy
equation gives

Ke =

µnw

1/σT + ∆mc/U

.

(10)

Here σT ≡ AL/Σ denotes the total con-
ductivity of the lattice. Thus, we might
consider the eﬀective permeability of the
nonwetting phase as a function of the con-
ductivity of the lattice and an additional

8

term due to the viscous drag on the clus-
ters (∆mc/U). Note that the U dependency
in Eq. (10) only indicates changes in ∆mc
between displacements executed at diﬀerent
injection rates. The behavior when the ﬂow
rate changes during a given displacement is
not discussed here.

3.2 BURST DYNAMICS

In the simulations a burst starts when the
pressure drops suddenly and stops when
the pressure has raised to a value above
the pressure that initiated the burst (see
Fig. 5). Thus, a burst may consist of a
large pressure valley containing a hierarchi-
cal structure of smaller pressure jumps (i.e.
bursts) inside. A pressure jump, indicated
as ∆p in Fig. 5, is the pressure diﬀerence
from the point when the pressure starts de-
creasing minus the pressure when it stops
decreasing. We deﬁne the size of the pres-

sure valley (valley size) to be χ ≡ Pi ∆pi,
where the summation index i runs over all
the pressure jumps ∆pi inside the valley.
The deﬁnition is motivated by experimen-
tal work in Ref. [28]. For slow displace-
ments we have that χ is proportional to the
geometric burst size s, being invaded dur-
ing the pressure valley. This statement has
been justiﬁed in Ref. [28], where it was ob-
served that in stable periods, the pressure
increased linearly as function of the volume
being injected into the system. Later, in an
unstable period where the pressure drops
abruptly due to a burst, this pressure drop
is proportional to s. At fast displacements
the pressure may no longer be a linear func-
tion of the volume injected into the system.
Therefore, a better estimate of s there, is
to compute the time period T of the pres-

are performed with constant rate, it is rea-
sonable to assume that T is always propor-
tional to the volume being injected during
the valley and hence, T ∝ s.

In Fig. 6 we have plotted the hierarchi-
cal valley size distribution Nall(χ), for six
simulations between low and high Ca with
M = 1 and 100 on a lattice of 40 × 60 and
25 × 35 nodes, respectively. Nall(χ) was cal-
culated by including all valley sizes and the
hierarchical smaller ones within a large val-
ley (see Fig. 5). To obtain reliable average
quantities we did 10 to 20 diﬀerent simula-
tions at each Ca. In order to calculate the

valley sizes at large Ca, we subtract the av-
erage drift in the pressure signal due to vis-
cous forces such that the pressure becomes a
function that ﬂuctuates around some mean
pressure.

By assuming a power law Nall(χ) ∝ χ−τall
our best estimate from Fig. 6 is τall = 1.9 ±
0.1, indicated by the slope of the solid line.
At low χ in Fig. 6, typically only one tube
is invaded during the valley and we do not
expect the power law to be valid. Similar
results were obtained when calculating the
hierarchical distribution of the time periods
T of the valleys, denoted as Nall(T ).

In invasion percolation (IP) the distribu-
tion of burst sizes N(s), where s denotes
the burst size, is found to obey the scaling
relation [27, 28, 39, 40]

N(s) ∝ s−τ ′

g(sσ(f0 − fc)).

(11)

Here fc is the percolation threshold of the
system and g(x) is some scaling function,
which decays exponentially when x ≫ 1
and is a constant when x → 0. τ ′ is re-
lated to percolation exponents like τ ′ =
1 + Df /D − 1/(Dν) [40], where Df and D
is the fractal dimension of the front and the
mass of the percolation cluster, respectively.
ν is the correlation length exponent in per-
colation theory and σ = 1/(νD) [41].
In
Eq. (11) a burst is deﬁned as the connected
structure of sites that is invaded following
one root site of random number f0, along
the invasion front. All sites in the burst
have random numbers smaller than f0, and
the burst stops when the random number
of the next site to be invaded is larger than
f0 [42].

By integrating Eq. (11) over all f0 in the
interval [0, fc] Maslov [43] deduced a scal-
ing relation for the hierarchical burst size
distribution Nall(s) following

Nall(s) ∝ s−τall,

(12)

where τall = 2.

In the low Ca regime in Fig. 6, the dis-
placements are in the capillary dominated
regime and the invading ﬂuid generates a
growing cluster similar to IP [4, 7–9].
In
this regime we also have that χ ∝ s [28]
and hence Nall(χ) corresponds to Nall(s) in
Eq. (12). Thus, in the low Ca regime we ex-
pect that Nall(χ) follows a power law with
exponent τall = 2 which is conﬁrmed by our
numerical results. Similar results were ob-
tained in Ref. [28].

The evidence in Fig. 6, that τall does not
seem to depend on Ca, is very interesting.
At high Ca when M = 0.01 an unstable vis-
cous ﬁngering structure generates and when

10

M ≥ 1 a stable front develops. It is an open
question how these displacement processes
map to the proposed scaling in Eq. (12). We
note that in the high Ca regime the relation
χ ∝ s may not be correct and T is preferred
when computing Nall. However, the simu-
lations show that Nall(χ) ∼ Nall(T ) even at
high Ca.

In Ref. [43] τall was pointed out to be
super universal for a broad class of self-
organized critical models including IP. The
result in Fig. 6 indicates that the simulated
displacements might belong to the same su-
per universality class even at high injection
rates where there is no clear mapping be-
tween the displacement process and IP.

Basak et al. [44,45] performed four drain-
age experiments where they used a 110×180
mm transparent porous model consisting
of a mono-layer of randomly placed glass
beads of 1 mm, sandwiched between two
Plexiglas plates. The experimental setup
was similar to the one used in Ref. [27].
The model was initially ﬁlled with a water-
glycerol mixture of viscosity 0.17 P. The
water-glycerol mixture was withdrawn from
one of the short side of the system at con-
stant rate by letting air enter the system
from the other short side. The pressure
in the water-glycerol mixture on the with-
drawn side was measured with a pressure
sensor of our own construction.

From the recorded pressure signal we cal-
culated the hierarchical distribution of time
periods of the valleys, Nall(T ). At low Ca
this corresponds to Nall(s) in Eq. (12). Be-
cause of the relative long response time of
the pressure sensor, rapid and small pres-
sure jumps due to small bursts are presum-
ably smeared out by the sensor and the
recorded pressure jumps are only reliable

for larger bursts. Hence, from the recorded
pressure signal T appears to be a better es-
timate of the burst sizes than χ.

In Fig. 7 we have plotted the logarithm
of Nall(T ) for experiments (open symbols)
and simulations (ﬁlled symbols) performed
at four diﬀerent Ca, respectively. To col-
lapse the data Nall(T ) and T were nor-
malized by their means.
In the simula-
tions M = 0.01 while in the experiments
M = 0.017 where we have assumed air
to have viscosity 0.29×10−2 P. We observe
that the experimental result is consistent
with our simulations and we conclude that
Nall(T ) ∝ T 1.9±0.1. This conﬁrms the scal-
ing of Nall(χ) in Fig. 6.

From Figs. 6 and 7 we conclude that
τall = 1.9 ± 0.1 for all displacement sim-
ulations going from low to high injection

11

rates when M = 0.01, 1, and 100. This
is also conﬁrmed by drainage experiments
performed at various injection rates with
M = 0.017. The evidence that τall is in-
dependent of the injection rate, may indi-
cate that the displacement process belongs
to the same super universality class as the
self-organized critical models in Ref. [43]
(τall = 2), even where there is no clear map-
ping between the displacement process and
IP.

4 STABILIZATION

MECHANISMS OF
THE FRONT

When the displacements are oriented out of
the horizontal plane and the injection rate is
low, gravity acting on the system, may sta-
bilize the front due to density diﬀerences be-
tween the ﬂuids. Several authors [30,46–48]
have conﬁrmed, by experiments and sim-
ulations, that the saturated front width
ws scales with the strength of gravity like
−ν/(1+ν). Here Bo (Bond number)
ws ∝ Bo
is the ratio between gravitational and capil-
lary forces, given by Bo = ∆ρga2/γ, where
∆ρ is the density diﬀerence between the ﬂu-
ids, g the acceleration due to gravity, a the
average pore size, and γ the ﬂuid-ﬂuid in-
terface tension. Furthermore, ν denotes the
correlation length exponent in percolation.
A similar consensus concerning the sta-
bilization mechanisms when the displace-
ments are oriented within the horizontal
plane, has not yet been reached.
In hori-
zontal displacements, viscous forces replace
gravitational forces, and in the literature
there exist diﬀerent suggestions about the

scaling of ws as function of Ca. The capil-
lary number Ca is the ratio between viscous
and capillary forces according to the deﬁ-
nition in Eq. (6).
In 3D, where trapping
of wetting ﬂuid is assumed to be of little
importance, Wilkinson [30] was the ﬁrst to
use percolation to deduce a power law like
−α where α = ν/(1 + t − β + ν).
ws ∝ Ca
Here t and β is the conductivity and order
parameter exponent in percolation, respec-
tively. Later, Blunt et al. [32] suggested in
3D that α = ν/(1 + t + ν). This is identi-
cal to the result of Lenormand [31] ﬁnding
a power law as function of system size for
the domain boundary in the Ca–M plane
between capillary ﬁngering and stable dis-
placement in 2D porous media.

More recently, Xu et al. [33] used the ar-
guments of Gouyet et al. [49] and Wilkin-
son [30] to show that the pressure drop
∆Pnw over a length ∆h in the nonwetting
phase of the front should scale as ∆Pnw ∝
∆ht/ν+DE−1−β/ν (see Fig. 8). Here DE de-
notes the Euclidean dimension of the space
in which the front is embedded, i.e. in our
case DE = 2. The pressure drop in the wet-
ting phase ∆Pw, was argued to be linearly
dependent on ∆h due to the compact phase
there (Fig. 8). In Ref. [32] Blunt et al. also
suggested a scaling relation for ∆Pnw, how-
ever, in 3D they found ∆Pnw ∝ ∆ht/ν+1.
This is diﬀerent from the result of Xu et al.
when DE = 3.

In the next section, Sec. 4.1, we present
an alternative view on the displacement
process from those initiated by Wilkin-
son [30], but include the evidence that non-
wetting ﬂuid ﬂows in separate strands (see
Fig. 9). The alternative view leads to an-
other scaling of ∆Pnw than the one Xu et
al. [33] would predict in 2D, and we show

that it may inﬂuence α in the scaling be-
tween ws and Ca. The new scaling of ∆Pnw
is supported by numerical experiments us-
ing the network model.

4.1 LOOPLESS STRANDS

Figure 9 shows two typical displacement
structures that were obtained from simu-
lations at low and high Ca on a lattice of
40 × 60 nodes with M = 1. From the ﬁg-
ure we observe that the nonwetting ﬂuid
(dark grey and black) generates patterns
containing no closed loops. That means,
following a path of nonwetting ﬂuid will
never bring us back to the starting point.
The nonwetting ﬂuid also ﬂows in separate
loopless strands, indicated as black tubes in
Fig. 9. The loopless structures in Fig. 9 are
a direct consequence of the evidence that

Figure 9: Two displacement structures of
simulations at high Ca = 3.9×10−4 (top)
and low Ca = 1.6×10−5 (bottom) before
breakthrough of nonwetting ﬂuid. The lat-
tice size is 40 × 60 nodes and M = 1.
The nonwetting ﬂuid (dark grey and black)
is injected from below and wetting ﬂuid
(light grey) ﬂows out along the top row.
The black tubes denote the loopless strands
where nonwetting ﬂuid ﬂows and the dark
grey tubes indicate nonwetting ﬂuid unable
to ﬂow (i.e. dead ends) due to trapped re-
gions of wetting ﬂuid. Note the few ﬂuid
supplying strands from the inlet to the
frontal region at low Ca compared to the
case at high Ca.

13

a tube ﬁlled with wetting ﬂuid and sur-
rounded on both sides by nonwetting ﬂuid is
trapped due to volume conservation of wet-
ting ﬂuid [50]. We note that this evidence
may easily be generalized to 3D, and there-
fore our arguments should apply there too.
We also note that trapping of wetting ﬂuid
is more diﬃcult in real porous media due
to a more complex topology of pores and
throats there. Loopless IP patterns have
earlier been observed in Refs. [51–53].

From Fig. 9 we may separate the dis-
placement patterns into two parts. One
consisting of the frontal region continuously
covering new tubes, and the other consist-
ing of the more static structure behind the
front. The frontal region is supplied by
nonwetting ﬂuid through a set of strands
that connect the frontal region to the inlet.
When the strands approach the frontal re-
gion they are more likely to split. Since we
are dealing with a square lattice, a splitting
strand may create either two or three new
strands. As the strands proceed upwards in
Fig. 9, they split repeatedly until the frontal
region is completely covered by nonwetting
strands.

On IP patterns without loops [51, 53, 54]
the length l of the minimum path between
two points separated an Euclidean distance
R scales like l ∝ RDs where Ds is the frac-
tal dimension of the shortest path. We as-
sume that the displacement pattern of the
frontal region for length less than the cor-
relation length (in our case ws) is statis-
tically equal to IP patterns in Ref. [51].
Therefore, the length of a strand in the
frontal region is proportional to ∆hDs when
∆h is less than ws. If we assume that on
the average every tube in the lattice has
same mobility (kij/µij), this causes the ﬂuid

pressure within a single strand to drop like
∆hDs as long as the strand does not split.
When the strand splits volume conserva-
tion causes the volume ﬂuxes through the
new strands to be less than the ﬂux in the
strand before it splits. Hence, following a
path where strands split will cause the pres-
sure to drop as ∆hκ where κ ≤ Ds. From
Fig. 9, we note that at high Ca the lengths
of individual strands in the frontal region
approach the minimum length due to the
tubes. Therefore, in this limit ﬁnite size ef-
fects are expected to cause Ds → 1.

From the above arguments we conclude
that the pressure drop ∆Pnw, in the nonwet-
ting phase of the frontal region (that is the
strands) should scale as ∆Pnw ∝ ∆hκ where
κ ≤ Ds.
In 2D two diﬀerent values for
Ds have been reported: Ds = 1.22 [53, 54]
for loopless IP with and without trapping
and growing around a central seed, and
Ds = 1.14 [51] for the single strand con-
necting the inlet to the outlet when non-
wetting ﬂuid percolates the system.
In
2D the result of Xu et al. [33] would give
κ = t/ν + DE − 1 − β/ν ≈ 1.9 where we
have inserted t = 1.3, ν = 4/3, β = 5/36,
and DE = 2. This result for κ is larger
than Ds and therefore not compatible with
our arguments.

To conﬁrm numerically that κ ≤ Ds,
we have calculated the diﬀerence in cap-
illary pressure ∆Pc between menisci along
the front by using our network model. ∆Pc
as function of ∆h is calculated by taking
the mean of the capillary pressure diﬀer-
ences between all pairs of menisci along the
front, separated a distance ∆h in the direc-
tion of the displacement. ∆Pc of a pair of
menisci is calculated by taking the capillary
pressure of the meniscus closest to the inlet

minus the capillary pressure of the meniscus
closest to the outlet.

Figure 10 shows ∆Pc as function of ∆h
for simulations performed at high, interme-
diate and low Ca, with M = 1 or 100. The
simulations with M = 100 were performed
on a 25 × 35 nodes lattice with µnw = 10
P, µw = 0.10 P, and γ = 30 dyn/cm.
The disorder was introduced by choosing
the tube radii at random in the interval
0.05d ≤ rij ≤ d. The tube length was
d = 0.1 cm. The simulations with M = 1
were performed on a distorted lattice of
40 × 60 nodes where 0.02 cm ≤ dij ≤ 0.18
cm and rij = dij/2α with α = 1.25. Here
µnw = µw = 0.5 P. We did 10–30 simu-
lations at each Ca to obtain reliable aver-
age quantities. From the plot we observe
that ∆Pc increases roughly linearly as func-
tion of ∆h. The simulations also show that
∆Pc ≃ ∆Pnw −∆Pw and that ∆Pw depends

linearly on ∆h due to the compact wetting
phase there (see Fig. 8). Hence our sim-
ulations give that ∆Pnw ∼ ∆Pc ∝ ∆hκ
where κ ≃ 1.0. This supports the argu-
ments giving κ ≤ Ds, and we conclude that
earlier proposed theories [30–33] which do
not consider the evidence that nonwetting
ﬂuid ﬂows in strands, are incompatible with
drainage when strands are important.

To save computation time and thereby be
able to study ∆Pc on larger lattices in the
low Ca regime, we have generated bond in-
vasion percolation (IP) patterns with trap-
ping on lattices of 200 × 300 nodes. The
bonds in the IP lattice correspond to the
tubes in the network model. The occupa-
tion of bonds started at the bottom row,
and the next bond to be occupied was
always the bond with the lowest random
number f from the set of empty bonds along
the invasion front. We applied a small gra-
dient in the random numbers of the bonds
to stabilize the front [30, 47].

When the IP patterns became well de-
veloped with trapped (wetting) clusters of
sizes between the bond length and the front
width, the tubes in our network model were
ﬁlled with nonwetting and wetting ﬂuid ac-
cording to occupied and empty bonds in
the IP lattice. Furthermore, the radii r
of the tubes were mapped properly to the
random numbers f of the bonds by ﬁrst re-
moving the gradient in f and then assigning
r = 1 − f [36]. The last transformation is
necessary because in the IP algorithm the
next bond to be invaded is the one with the
lowest random number, opposite to the net-
work model, where the widest tube will be
invaded ﬁrst.

Having initialized the tube network, the
network model was started and the simu-

15

lations were run a limited number of time
steps while recording ∆Pc. The number of
time steps where chosen suﬃciently large
to let the menisci along the front adjust
according to the viscous pressure set up
by the injection rate. By this method we
save the computation time that would have
been required if the displacement patterns
should have been generated by the network
model instead of the much faster IP algo-
rithm. However, to make this method self-
consistent we have to assume that the IP
patterns are statistically equal to the corre-
sponding structures that would have been
generated by the network model.

Totally, we generated four IP patterns
with diﬀerent sets of random numbers and
every pattern was loaded into the network
model. The result of the calculated ∆Pc
versus ∆h is shown in Fig. 11 for Ca =
9.5×10−5 and M = 100.
If we assume
a power law ∆Pc ∝ ∆hκ, we ﬁnd κ =
1.0 ± 0.1. The slope of the straight line in
Fig. 11 is 1.0. We have also calculated ∆Pc
for Ca = 2×10−6 with M = 1 and M = 100
by using one of the generated IP patterns.
The result of those simulations is consistent
with Fig. 11 which indeed show the similar
behavior as the results in Fig. 10.

An important issue, arising at low Ca, is
the eﬀect of bursts on the capillary pres-
sure. A burst occurs when a meniscus along
the front becomes unstable and nonwetting
ﬂuid abruptly covers new tubes [28]. The
tube where the burst initiates will during
the burst, experiences a much higher ﬂuid
transport relative to tubes far away. De-
scribing the pressure behavior between the
tube of the burst and the rest of the front is
nontrivial. However, simulations show that
even during bursts, we ﬁnd that ∆Pc in-

creases linearly with ∆h.

The evidence that κ ≃ 1.0 may inﬂuence
−α. Assum-
the exponent α in ws ∝ Ca
ing Darcy ﬂow where the pressure drop de-
pends linearly on the injection rate, we con-

jecture that ∆ bPc ∝ Ca∆hκ. Here ∆ bPc de-

notes the capillary pressure diﬀerence over
a height ∆h when the front is stationary.

That means, ∆ bPc excludes situations where

nonwetting ﬂuid rapidly invades new tubes
due to local instabilities (i.e. bursts). The
above conjecture is supported by simula-
tions showing that in the low Ca regime
∆ bPc ∝ Ca∆hκ where κ ≃ 1.0. Note, that
∆ bPc 6≃ ∆Pc in Fig. 10 since the latter in-
At suﬃciently low Ca where only the
strength of the capillary pressure decides

colation giving ∆ bPc ∝ f −fc ∝ ξ−1/ν [30,47,
49]. Here f is the random numbers in the
percolation lattice, fc is the critical percola-
tion threshold, and ξ ∝ ws is the correlation
length. Combining the above relations for
−α where α = ν/(1+νκ).
In 2D ν = 4/3 and by inserting κ = 1.0 we
obtain α ≈ 0.57. Note that this is diﬀer-
ent to results suggested in Refs. [30, 32, 33]
giving α ≈ 0.37–0.38 in 2D.

∆ bPc gives ws ∝ Ca

At high Ca the nonwetting ﬂuid is found
to invade simultaneously everywhere along
the front, and consequently the front never
reaches a stationary state [36]. In this limit
simulations show a nonlinear dependency

between ∆ bPc and Ca. Therefore, in the high
Ca regime it is not clear if the above map-
ping to percolation is valid, and we expect
another type of relation between ws and Ca.

4.2 COMPARISON WITH

EXPERIMENTS

[55] have performed two-
Frette et al.
phase drainage experiments in a 2D porous
medium with viscosity matched ﬂuids
(M = 1). They reported on the stabi-
lization of the front and measured the sat-
urated front width ws, as function of Ca.
Their best estimate on the exponent in
−α was α = 0.6 ± 0.2. This is
ws ∝ Ca
consistent with the above conjecture (α =
0.57), however, corresponding simulations
on 40 × 60 nodes lattices give α = 0.3 ± 0.1.
Figure 12 contains the data of Frette et
al.
(ﬁlled circles) and the result of our
simulations (open diamonds). The simu-
lations are performed at Ca ≥ 1.0×10−5
while most of the experiments where done
at Ca ≤ 1.0×10−5. Since the range of the

two does not overlap it is diﬃcult to com-
pare the result of the simulations with those
of the experiments. However, the change
in α from 0.6 to 0.3, might be consistent
with a crossover to another behavior at high
Ca according to the discussion in Sec. 4.1.
We also note, that in the simulations at
Ca ≃ 1.0×10−5, the front width approaches
the maximum width due to the system size,
making it diﬃcult to observe any possible
α ≈ 0.57 regime at low Ca. We emphasize
that more simulations on larger systems and
at lower Ca are needed before any conclu-
sion on α can be drawn.

4.3 DISCUSSION

The evidence that the nonwetting ﬂuid dis-
places the wetting ﬂuid in a set of loopless

17

strands opens new questions about the dis-
placement process. Returning to Fig. 9 it
is striking to observe the diﬀerent patterns
of strands at high and low Ca. At low Ca
few strands are supplying the frontal region
with nonwetting ﬂuid, and the strands split
many times before the whole front is cov-
ered. At high Ca the horizontal distance
between each strand in the static structure
is much shorter, and only a few splits are
required to cover the front. We conjecture
that the average horizontal distance be-
tween the ﬂuid supplying strands depends
on the front width. However, further inves-
tigation of the displacement patterns is re-
quired before any conclusions can be drawn.
So far the arguments in Sec. 4.1 only con-
sider displacements where the nonwetting
strands contain no loops. A very interesting
question that has to be answered is: What
happens to κ when diﬀerent strands in the
front connect to generate loops. In ordinary
bond or site percolation loops generally oc-
cur. Loops are also observed in experiments
corresponding to those of Frette et al. [55].
In the experiments it is more diﬃcult to
trap wetting ﬂuid due to the more complex
topology of pores and throats (see Fig. 1).
Consequently,
loops will more easily gen-
erate there, than in the case of a regular
square lattice. Loops might also be created
when neighboring menisci along the front
overlap and coalesce depending on the wet-
ting properties of the nonwetting ﬂuid [5,6].
As a ﬁrst approximation we conjecture
that creation of loops will not cause κ to
change signiﬁcantly. Note that in the front
the diﬀerent nonwetting strands connecting
to each other to create loops, must at some
later time split. Otherwise successive con-
nections will cause the diﬀerent strands to

coalesce into one single strand of nonwet-
ting ﬂuid. Moreover, after the front width
has saturated, the number of places where
diﬀerent strands connect must on average
be balanced by the number of places where
strands split. Therefore, we believe that
the inﬂuence on κ due to connections (i.e.
loops) will be compensated by the splits and
the overall behavior of κ will remain the
same. We emphasize that further simula-
tions and experiments are required to in-
vestigate the eﬀect of loops on κ.

According to the discussion in Sec. 4.3,
the evidence that the displacement patterns
consist of loopless strands may easily be
generalized to 3D. Therefore our arguments
giving κ ≤ Ds, might be valid in 3D as
well. Note also that in 3D it is less proba-
ble that diﬀerent strands meet. Hence, even
if they were supposed to connect to create
loops, the number of created loops are ex-
pected to be few. In 3D the fractal dimen-
sion of the shortest path for loopless IP is
Ds = 1.42 [53].

5 CONCLUSION

We conclude that our 2D network model
properly simulates the temporal evolution
of the pressure in the ﬂuids during drainage.
We have seen that capillary forces situ-
ated around isolated and trapped regions of
wetting ﬂuid, contribute to the total pres-
sure across the lattice, as well as the capil-
lary ﬂuctuations due invasion of nonwetting
ﬂuid along the front.

We have found that the model reproduces
the typical burst dynamics at low injection
rates and we have investigated the statis-
tics of the bursts by calculating the hierar-

18

chical valley size distribution Nall(χ). We
conclude that Nall(χ) follows a power law,
Nall(χ) ∝ χ−τall where τall = 1.9 ± 0.1 is
independent of the injection rate and vis-
cosity ratio. Similar result is obtained from
experiments. At low injection rates the
result is consistent with the prediction in
Ref. [43] (τall = 2), which was deduced for
a broad spectrum of diﬀerent self-organized
critical models including IP. The evidence
that τall is independent of the injection rate,
may indicate that the displacement pro-
cess belongs to the same super universality
class as the self-organized critical models in
Ref. [43], even where there is no clear map-
ping between the displacement process and
IP.

We have also simulated the behavior of
the capillary pressure along the front. Sim-
ulations show that the capillary pressure
diﬀerence ∆Pc between two points along
the front varies almost linearly as function
of distance ∆h in the direction of the dis-
placement. The numerical result supports
arguments based on the observation that
nonwetting ﬂuid ﬂows in separate strands
where wetting ﬂuid is displaced. From the
arguments we ﬁnd that ∆Pc ∝ ∆hκ where
κ ≤ Ds. Here Ds denotes the fractal dimen-
sion of the nonwetting strands.

Several attempts have been made to
describe the stabilization mechanisms in
drainage due to viscous forces, however,
none of them consider the evidence that
nonwetting ﬂuid displaces wetting ﬂuid
through strands. Therefore, we conclude
that earlier suggested theories fail to de-
scribe the stabilization of the invasion front
when strands dominate the displacements.

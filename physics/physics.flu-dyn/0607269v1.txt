We investigate using direct numerical simulations with grids up to 15363 points, the rate at which
small scales develop in a decaying three-dimensional MHD ﬂow both for deterministic and random
initial conditions. Parallel current and vorticity sheets form at the same spatial locations, and
further destabilize and fold or roll-up after an initial exponential phase. At high Reynolds numbers,
a self-similar evolution of the current and vorticity maxima is found, in which they grow as a cubic
power of time; the ﬂow then reaches a ﬁnite dissipation rate independent of Reynolds number.

Magnetic ﬁelds are ubiquitous in the cosmos and play
an important dynamical role, as in the solar wind,
stars or the interstellar medium. Such ﬂows have large
Reynolds numbers and thus nonlinear mode coupling
leads to the formation of strong intermittent structures.
It has been observed that such extreme events in magne-
tohydrodynamics (MHD) are more intense than for ﬂu-
ids; for example, wings of Probability Distribution Func-
tions of ﬁeld gradients are wider and one observes a
stronger departure from purely self-similar linear scaling
with the order of the anomalous exponents of structure
functions [1]. Since Reynolds numbers are high but ﬁ-
nite, viscosity and magnetic resistivity play a role, tearing
mode instabilities develop and reconnection takes place.
The question then becomes at what rate does dissipation
occur, as the Reynolds number increases? What is the
origin of these structures, and how fast are they formed?
This is a long-standing problem in astrophysics, e.g. in
the context of reconnection events in the magnetopause,
or of heating of solar and stellar corona. In such ﬂuids,
many other phenomena may have to be taken into ac-
count, such as ﬁnite compressibility and ionization, lead-
ing to a more complex Ohm’s law with e.g. a Hall cur-
rent or radiative or gravitational processes to name a few.
Many aspects of the two-dimensional (2D) case are un-
derstood, but the three-dimensional (3D) turbulent case
remains more obscure. Pioneering works [2] show that
the topology of the reconnecting region, more complex
than in 2D, can lead to varied behavior.

The criterion for discriminating between a singular and
a regular behavior in the absence of magnetic ﬁelds fol-
lows the seminal work by Beale, Kato and Majda (here-
after BKM) [3] where, for a singularity to develop in the
Euler case, the time integral of the supremum of the vor-
ticity must grow as (t−t∗)−α with α ≥ 1 and t∗ the singu-
larity time. In MHD [4], one deals with the Els¨asser ﬁelds
z± = v±b and ω± = ω±j = ∇×(v±b), with ω the vor-
ticity, v the velocity, j the current density and b = ∇×A
the induction in dimensionless Alfvenic units, A being
the vector potential. Intense current sheets are known to
form at either magnetic nulls (b ≡ 0) or when one or two
(but not all) components of the magnetic ﬁeld go to zero
or have strong gradients. In two dimensional conﬁgura-
tions, a vortex quadrupole is also associated with these
structures. The occurrence of singularities in MHD has

been examined in direct numerical simulations (DNS),
with either regular [5, 6] or adaptive grids [7], and with
diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations with no clear-cut conclu-
sions in view of the necessity for resolving a large range of
scales (see [8] and references therein for the Euler case).
Laboratory experiments and DNS have also studied the
ensuing acceleration of particles in the reconnection re-
gion (see e.g. [9]).

The early development of small scales in such ﬂows is
exponential [10] (in the context of turbulent ﬂows, see e.g.
[11]), because of the large-scale gradients of the velocity
and magnetic ﬁelds, assumed given, stretching the vor-
ticity and current. The phase beyond the linear stage,
though, is still unclear.
In 2D, numerical simulations
with periodic boundary conditions show that the late-
time evolution of non-dissipative MHD ﬂows remains at
most exponential [12], a point latter conﬁrmed theoreti-
cally [13] by examining the structure around hyperbolic
nulls, although ﬁnite dissipation seems to set in [14].

In 3D, most initial conditions develop sheets that may
render the problem quasi two-dimensional locally; 3D
MHD ﬂows display a growth of small scales of an ex-
ponential nature, although at later times a singular be-
havior may emerge [6]. In this light, we address in this
paper the early development of structures in 3D and the
ensuing evolution in the presence of dissipation.

omitting dissipation. Note that the ﬁrst term on the
r.h.s. of (3) is equal to zero in 2D; the second term is
absent in the Navier-Stokes case and may account for
extra growth of the generalized vorticities for conducting
ﬂuids unless the Els¨asser ﬁeld gradients are parallel.

To study the development of structures in MHD turbu-
lence, we solve numerically Eqs. (1) using a pseudospec-
tral method in a three dimensional box of side 2π with
periodic boundary conditions. All computations are de-
aliased, using the standard 2/3 rule. With a minimum
wavenumber of kmin = 1 corresponding to L0 = 2π, a lin-
ear resolution of N grid points has a maximum wavenum-
ber kmax = N/3. At all times we have kD/kmax < 1,
where kD is the dissipation wavenumber evaluated using
the Kolmogorov spectrum (at early times the resolution
condition is less stringent). Two diﬀerent initial condi-
tions are used; Table I summarizes all the runs.

As the system is evolved, we monitor the small scale
development by following the dynamical evolution of the
extrema of the generalized vorticities or of their individ-
ual components [16] in the spirit of the BKM criterion.

We start discussing the results for the Orszag-Tang
vortex (OT hereafter); in two dimensions [17], it has be-
come a prototype ﬂow for the study of MHD turbulence,
including in the compressible case [18]. In 3D, the veloc-
ity and the magnetic ﬁeld are taken to be:

v0 = [−2 sin y, 2 sin x, 0]
,
b0 = β[−2 sin 2y + sin z, 2 sin x + sin z, sin x + sin y].

The OT ﬂow in 2D has a stagnation point in the (x, y)
plane and an hyperbolic X-point for the magnetic ﬁeld;
a 3D perturbation is added in the z direction, resulting
in a ﬂow that has nulls for the magnetic ﬁeld (three com-
ponents equal to zero) of diﬀerent types [19] correspond-
ing to the signs of the eigenvalues of the ∂ibj matrix [5];
initially, the kinetic and magnetic energy EV and EM
are equal to 2 with β = 0.8, the normalized correlation

FIG. 1: (a) Evolution of the supremum of current for the OT
runs in log-log. The inset shows the evolution at early times
in lin-log units; a slope of t3 is also indicated. The exponential
phase ends at t ∼ 0.6. (b) Total dissipation as a function of
time for the same runs in lin-lin. Re = 570 (solid), Re = 1040
(dot), Re = 3040 (dash), and Re = 5600 (dash-dot).

t ∼ 0.6 and corresponding to the linear development of
current (and vorticity) sheets through stretching by ve-
locity gradients, a faster increase develops with, at high
resolution, a self-similar ∼ t3 law. Note that the growth
of max{j} during the early exponential phase seems to
be independent of the value of Re.

The ﬁrst temporal maximum of max{j} is reached at
slightly later times as Re increases; similarly [see Fig.
1(b)], the total energy dissipation ǫ shows a delay in the
onset of the development of small scales as Re grows, rem-
iniscent of 2D behavior [14], with a slower global growth
rate after the initial exponential phase; this delay, how-
ever, does not preclude reaching a quasi-constant maxi-
mum of ǫ in time as Re grows. Whereas in the 2D case,
the constancy of ǫ only obtains at later times when re-
connection sets in, with a multiplicity of current sheets,
in the 3D case more instabilities of current and vorticity
structures are possible and the ﬂow becomes complex as
soon as the linear phase has ended. The dependence on
Re of the time at which the ﬁrst maximum of max{j} is
reached is slow (∼ R0.08
), and similarly for the time the
maximum of ǫ is reached. Computations at higher Re
should be performed to conﬁrm these results.

The sharp transition around t = 0.6 can be interpreted
in terms of the non-locality of interactions in MHD tur-

FIG. 3: (Color online) Regions of strong current density, and
magnetic ﬁeld lines in their vicinity for run RND5 at t = 1.6.
The region at left has 4502 × 250 points, and that at right has
260 × 160 × 200. The sheets are thin and elongated (up to 1/3
the size of the box); the magnetic ﬁeld lines are parallel to
the sheet and quasi-orthogonal to each other on each side of
it, and they depart from the sheet transversally. Both folding
(left) and rolling (right) occurs at this Re. Vortex sheets (not
shown) are co-located and parallel to the current sheets.

runs (RND1-RND4) were done with resolutions ranging
from 643 to 5123 grid points; RND5 on a grid of 15363
points is run until saturation of growth of the maximum
current.

Both the exponential and the self-similar phases are
noisier (see Fig. 2a), as can be expected with several
structures competing for the small scale development of
maxima. At low Re, self-similar evolution seems to occur
at a slower pace, with laws ∼ t2, as in fact also found in
2D at comparable resolutions. However, the two runs
with highest resolution (RND4 and RND5) indicate a
steeper development compatible with a t3 law.

Figure 2(b) shows the evolution of the magnetic energy
spectrum EM (k) at early times, during the self-similar
growth of the current density [the evolution of EV (k) is
similar]. Before t ∼ 0.6, the largest wavenumbers have
amplitudes of the order of the truncation error. For t ≥
0.6, as all scales are nonlinearly excited, a self-similar
growth sets in and the energy spectra are compatible
with a k−3 law. After max{j} saturates, the slope of
EM (k) increases slowly towards a k−1.70 law. The same
behavior is observed in the OT run, in which no k−3
power law is imposed in the initial conditions.

The structures that develop appear to be accumula-
tions of current sheets (similarly for the vorticity, not
shown), as was already found in [5]. Figure 3 shows a
zoom on two such structures, with the magnetic ﬁeld lines
indicated as well. It appears clear from such ﬁgures that
only one component of the magnetic ﬁeld reverses sign
in most of these conﬁgurations, reminiscent of magneto-
spheric observations. Both terms appearing in Eq. (3)
for the dynamical evolution of ω± are substantial and
comparable in magnitude although they may be quite
weak elsewhere in the ﬂow. Kelvin-Helmoltz instabili-

Re = 1300 (dot), Re = 2300 (dash), Re = 4200 (dot-dash),
and Re = 10100 (long dash). At high Re, a power law con-
sistent with t3 is recovered. (b) Magnetic energy spectra at

bulence [20] with transfer of energy involving widely sep-
arated scales. Thus, as the ﬂow exits the linear phase,
all scales can interact simultaneously; this may be a rea-
son why, in a computation using OT and adaptive mesh
reﬁnement [7], it was found to be diﬃcult to go beyond
t = 0.6 since small scales were developing abruptly in
many places in the ﬂow through prevailing nonlinearities.
The energy spectra in this early phase are steep, with a
power law ∼ k−3 (not shown). A shallower ∼ k−1.70 spec-
trum develops at later times, as found in earlier works.

In view of similarities between the behavior observed
on the 3D OT vortex and its 2D counter-part, it is worth
asking whether such a development is not due to the
high degree of symmetry of the ﬂow. In that light, we
now examine the temporal development of a Beltrami
ﬂow on which small scale random ﬂuctuations are added.
The initial velocity and magnetic ﬁeld spectra are taken
∼ k−3e−2(k/k0)
; the shells with k ∈ [1, 3] have a su-
perposition of three ABC ﬂows [21], and the rest of the
spectrum is loaded with Fourier modes with Gaussian
random realizations for their phases chosen so that ini-
tially, EV = EM = 0.5, ˜ρc ∼ 10−4 and HM ∼ 0.45.
Unlike the OT runs, there are no 2D null points or ex-
act zeros in the magnetic ﬁeld. As for the OT case, four

2

4

ties with rolling up of such sheets are also present in
the ﬂow but only at the highest Reynolds number (run
RND5); at lower Re the sheets are thicker, the insta-
bility is too slow and only folding of such sheets occur.
Magnetic ﬁeld lines are parallel to the roll, in such a
way that magnetic tension does not prevent the occur-
rence of the instability. Note that folding of magnetic
structures has been advocated in the context of MHD
at large magnetic Prandtl number [22]. Alfvenization of
the ﬂow (v = ±b) is rather strong in the vicinity of the
sheets, with 0.7 ≤ |˜ρc| ≤ 1, although globally the ﬂow
remains uncorrelated (˜ρc ∼ 4 × 10−4); this local Alfv-
enization gives stability to such structures since the non-
linear terms are weakened, in much the same way vor-
tex tubes in Navier-Stokes ﬂows are long-lived because
of (partial) Beltramization (v ∼ ±ω). Moreover, within
the sheet ˜ρc is positive, and it is negative outside, with a
slight predominance of b. All this indicates that a double
velocity-magnetic ﬁeld shear plays an important role in
the development of small scales in MHD.

There is an elementary, analytically-soluble, one-
dimensional model that illustrates sharply the role that
velocity shear can play in enhancing current intensity,
e.g. during early dynamo activity [23]. This consists of
two semi-inﬁnite slabs of rigid metal with equal conduc-
tivities, at rest against each other at the plane y = 0,
say. A uniform dc magnetic ﬁeld b0 is perpendicular to
the interface and penetrates both slabs. At time t = 0,
the slabs are impulsively forced to slide past each other
in the x-direction with equal and opposite velocities (v0,

say). The developing (quasi-magnetostatic) ﬁeld, which
acquires an x-component, is a function of y and t only,
and is governed by diﬀusion equations above and below
the plane y = 0. Matching tangential components of the
electric ﬁeld immediately above and below the interface
reduces the pair to a soluble diﬀusion equation with a
ﬁxed y-derivative at y = 0. The resulting magnetic ﬁeld
is expressible in terms of complementary error functions
and grows without bound, as does the total Ohmic dis-
sipation. The introduction of a time dependence in v0
may allow also for solutions in which the maximum of
the current grows as a power law in time.

In conclusion, high resolution simulations of the early
stages in the development of MHD turbulence allowed us
to study the creation and evolution of small scale struc-
tures in three-dimensional ﬂows. Roll up of current and
vortex sheets, and a self-similar growth of current and
vorticity maxima was found, features that to the best
of our knowledge were not observed in previous simula-
tions at smaller Reynolds numbers. Also, a convergence
of the maximum dissipation rate to a value independent
of Re was found. More analysis will be carried out to
understand how structures are formed, the relevance of
the development of alignment between the ﬁelds and the
creation and role of local exact solutions to the MHD
equations (such as Alfv´en waves).

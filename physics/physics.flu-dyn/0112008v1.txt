Dynamics of immersed molecules in superﬂuids

(Dated: November 2, 2011)

The dynamics of a molecule immersed in a superﬂuid medium are considered. Results are derived
using a classical hydrodynamic approach followed by canonical quantization. The classical model, a
rigid body immersed in incompressible ﬂuid, permits a thorough analysis; its eﬀective Hamiltonian
generalizes the usual rigid-rotor Hamiltonian. In contrast to the free rigid rotor, the immersed body
is shown to have chaotic dynamics. Quantization of the classical model leads to new and experi-
mentally veriﬁable features. It is shown, for instance, that chiral molecules can behave as “quantum
propellers”: the rotational-translational coupling induced by the superﬂuid leads to a nonzero linear
momentum in the ground state. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong candidate for experimental detection
of this eﬀect. The signature is a characteristic splitting of rotational absorption lines. The 101 → 110
line in hydrogen peroxide, for example, is predicted to split into three lines separated by as much
as 0.05 cm−1, or ﬁve times the experimental linewidth.

INTRODUCTION

The dynamics of a molecule moving within a superﬂuid medium are not expected to be too diﬀerent from its
dynamics in vacuum. Like the vacuum, an unbounded ﬂuid is homogeneous and invariant with respect to continuous
translations and rotations. Moreover, in the exotic case of superﬂuids, the very low level of excitation achieved at low
temperatures implies that there is a vanishing set of modes with which the immersed molecule can interact. These
expectations are borne out in the spectroscopy of single impurity molecules in 4He nanodroplets, where the superﬂuid
medium has little eﬀect on the rotational spectrum beyond modifying the molecular moments of inertia.1,2,3

On the other hand, a low temperature superﬂuid medium is distinct from the nonrelativistic vacuum in that it lacks
a basic symmetry: Galilean invariance. The superﬂuid condensate deﬁnes a preferred rest frame, an “ether” relative to
which molecular velocities should be measured. This implies, in particular, that the energy-momentum relationship
of molecules immersed in superﬂuids can deviate from a parabolic form. Of more interest spectroscopically, the
presence of a preferred rest frame also gives rise to the possibility of rotational-translational couplings that are strictly
forbidden in an environment with Galilean invariance. Evidence of such couplings would provide one of the most
direct experimental signatures of the superﬂuid medium.

This paper develops a simple and general theoretical framework for the rigid-body dynamics of a molecule immersed
in a bosonic superﬂuid. The classical analysis of an immersed body, presented in Section II, shows that an incom-
pressible ﬂuid medium adds 11 parameters to the usual 4 parameters characterizing a free rigid body. As a result, an
immersed body is typically chaotic. The classical model is quantized in Section III, and the quantum Hamiltonian is
J which directly couples the linear momentum
discussed. The most interesting new feature is a term of the form p
and spin angular momentum of the molecule. This coupling requires chirality in the molecule, and corresponds intu-
itively to the action of a propeller. It fully lifts the usual (2J + 1)-fold degeneracy of rigid-rotor states with angular
momentum J, providing a clear spectroscopic signature of the superﬂuid-induced rotational-translational coupling.
An unusual consequence is that the ground state acquires nonzero linear momentum. In Section IV, the magnitude of
the rotational-translational coupling is estimated for the chiral molecules HOOH and FOOF. The predicted splitting
of rotational absorption lines, at least for HOOH, is well above the resolution of current experiments. Finally, in
Section V, the results are discussed in the context of related work.

II. CLASSICAL MECHANICS OF AN IMMERSED RIGID BODY

We consider a rigid body immersed in unbounded, incompressible ﬂuid of density ρf . The body occupies a bounded,
simply-connected volume V from which the ﬂuid is excluded; the surface of this volume is denoted by ∂V . The velocity
of the ﬂuid is described by a potential φ(x), such that vf = ∇φ, which satisﬁes
2φ = 0 inside the ﬂuid volume and
∇φ(x)
n = 0, where n
|
is the surface normal and vs is the surface velocity.

. On the moving surface ∂V , the ﬂuid velocity also must satisfy (vf

We choose an origin and coordinate axes ﬁxed in the body; this deﬁnes the body frame. The origin of the body
from the lab axes. The three components of y
completely specify the position of the body. When
= ˆ11, the body and lab frames coincide, and the body is said to be in the reference position. Let Et be

The time-dependence of V is simply Vt = EtV0, where V0 is a ﬁxed volume; similarly, ∂Vt = Et∂V0. The lab-frame
velocity of a point Etx, which is ﬁxed in the body, is

only on the shape of ∂V0.

For a free rigid body, the Lagrangian is just the kinetic energy. When the body is immersed, this is augmented by

the kinetic energy of the ﬂuid:

The mass tensor ˆM , the rotational-translational coupling tensor ˆG, and the inertia tensor ˆI can each be expressed as
a sum of rigid-body and ﬂuid tensors: ˆM = ˆM (0) + δ ˆM and so on.

Lagrangian then takes the familiar form

Note that the mass and inertia tensors ˆM and ˆI are symmetric, while the rotational-translational coupling ˆG has no
obvious symmetry. In the most general case there are 6 + 6 + 9 = 21 parameters in the Lagrangian. We can place the
body origin at a conveniently chosen point in the body, reducing this to 18. We can then rotate the body axes with
respect to the body, leaving 15. By comparison, the free rigid rotor has 4 parameters.

In the following section it is shown that ˆβ must be symmetric in order to avoid complication when quantizing the
model. We can symmetrize ˆβ by choosing the body frame’s origin correctly. It is not hard to see that the tensors ˆα,
ˆβ, and ˆγ transform in a particular way when the body origin is translated within the body; this can be used to ﬁnd
the appropriate choice of origin. For a free rigid body, the body’s center of mass is the correct choice, but this is not
true in general. After the body origin is ﬁxed, rotation of the body axes can be used to diagonalize ˆγ, leaving it in the
form ˆγ = diag(2A, 2B, 2C). Note that A, B, and C are eﬀective rotational constants, shifted from their rigid-body
values by the body’s interaction with the ﬂuid. Finally, the symmetric matrices ˆα and ˆβ can be broken down into
their scalar and rank-2 spherical tensor components:

and analogously for ˆβ, where

six degrees of freedom are reduced to two, so the reduced phase space is four-dimensional. It can be parametrized by
the directions of p′ and J′, expressed in polar coordinates by the four angles (θp, φp, θJ , φJ ). The energy shells of the

The integrability of a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom can be ascertained using a Poincar´e section,
essentially by inspection. To illustrate that the immersed rigid body is generally chaotic, we display a Poincar´e
section of the reduced phase space in Fig. 1. The ﬁgure was generated by repeatedly integrating the equations of
= 2 energy shell, and plotting the point (φJ , cos θJ ) each
motion, starting at many diﬀerent points within the
time a trajectory crossed the plane θp = π/2. The Hamiltonian parameters were ˆα = ˆ11, ˆβ = diag(1, 1,
2), and
ˆγ = diag(1, 2, √5); the conserved quantities were set to p
J = 0.1 and p = 0.1ez. If the system were integrable, each
·
phase space trajectory would be conﬁned to a two-dimensional torus, and would appear in the ﬁgure as a densely
dotted curve. Instead, the ﬁgure shows that the phase space contains chaotic regions, where trajectories ergodically
visit three-dimensional volumes, as well as quasi-integrable regions, where trajectories are conﬁned to two-dimensional
tori.

III. QUANTUM HAMILTONIAN

The quantization of the classical Hamiltonian [Eq. (16)] is straightforward, and proceeds as in any standard angular
momentum text (see, for instance, Ref. 4). There is only one subtlety. Since p′ and J′ have a nonvanishing Poisson
bracket, their quantum counterparts do not commute, and the quantization of terms like p′
ν suﬀers from an ordering

µJ ′

ambiguity. We can sidestep this problem because we only need to quantize the components of Θ(2): since
µν-antisymmetric, while each matrix ˆ

for the cases we consider in the next Section, these factors are less than 10−3, so it is reasonable to truncate the

τ M is an eﬀective mass; it reduces to the mass of the body in the absence of the ﬂuid. The
constant ˜Bτ is a pseudoscalar associated with the family of levels
. It is nonzero only in the presence of the ﬂuid,
and only when the immersed body is chiral. Judging from the spectrum, ˜Bτ measures the tendency of the immersed
body to have its linear and angular momenta aligned. When this tendency is strong, the body behaves as a kind of
“quantum propeller.”

IV. MOLECULAR SURFACE MODEL AND NUMERICAL RESULTS

In order to apply these results to a real system, we must specify the ﬂuid density ρf , model the surface ∂V0 and
mass density ρ(x) which characterize the immersed body, and calculate the tensors ˆM , ˆG, and ˆI from these inputs.
In this section we consider the interesting case of an immersed molecule in superﬂuid helium. The ﬂuid density ρf
is approximately 0.1 amu-˚A−3. The mass density of the molecule can be represented as ρ(x) =
xi),
where the atomic coordinates xi are known. Helium is kept away from the molecule primarily by the short-ranged
Fermi repulsion between molecular electrons and helium electrons. This results in a smoothly varying helium density,
interpolating from zero near the molecule to ρf far away. Our model approximates this smooth variation by a
discontinuous jump, localized on the imaginary surface ∂V0. The optimal choice of surface is not obvious, but some
criteria are clearly important. The surface should share the symmetries of the molecule; it should be smooth, since
the electronic densities are smooth; and its size and shape should be physically reasonable: when compared to the
actual helium density proﬁle, the surface should approximate the surface ρ = 1
2 ρf . With these criteria in mind, we
model the surface ∂V0 for an immersed molecule in the following way. First, we place a sphere of radius Ri at each
atomic coordinate xi. Each radius is proportional to the van der Waals distance between a helium atom and an atom
of type i: Ri = cRHe-i, where the parameter c will be of order 1. (For our calculations, we used RHe-H = 2.60 ˚A,
RHe-F = 2.87 ˚A, and RHe-O = 2.92 ˚A.5) The union of these spheres forms a cuspy volume. The surface radius of
the body volume, relative to an origin within the molecule, is represented in polar coordinates as rs(θ, φ). We then
smooth the function rs using the rotationally invariant linear operator which maps Ylm(θ, φ)
αl) Ylm(θ, φ),
with α = 0.1, to yield the ﬁnal surface ∂V0. This prescription gives a single-parameter family of smooth surfaces which
share the symmetry of the molecule; the parameter c can be adjusted to exclude superﬂuid from an appropriately
sized volume.

Once the surface is ﬁxed, the ﬂuid tensors can be calculated either numerically or analytically. We used a pertur-
bative analytical method, valid for nearly spherical surfaces, where the surface radius is a weakly varying function of
polar angle: rs(θ, φ) = r0 (1 + ǫ(θ, φ)), with ǫ
1. The ﬂuid response functions ψµ and χµ (see Section II) can then
be calculated as power series in ǫ, as can the ﬂuid contributions to the tensors. This calculation has been carried
through to second order, which is the lowest order at which nontrivial rotational-translational coupling (i.e. a nonzero
value for ˜Bτ ) is seen. The calculation and results are described in the Appendix.

≪

We present data for the low-lying levels of two diﬀerent molecules: hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) and dioxygen
diﬂuoride (FOOF). These molecules are depicted in Fig. 2, with structural parameters taken from Ref. 6. Each has a
C2 point group, which we have taken to be C2(y) by an appropriate rotation of body axes. The allowed rotational levels
all have the same parity under rotation by π around the y-axis: either even (000, 111, 202, . . . ) or odd (101, 110, 212, . . . ),
depending on the symmetry of the joint electronic/nuclear wavefunction. In the case where allowed levels are odd,
the J = 0 state is forbidden, so the ground state of the immersed molecule has J = 1, and, by Eq. (23), a nonzero
linear momentum. The ground state momentum is k0 =

, where τ0 is the ground state with J = 1.

The results for HOOH and FOOF are presented in Tables I and II respectively, in units where ¯h = c = kB = 1. The
surfaces considered can be parametrized by their mean radius r0, shown in the ﬁrst column. The values displayed
1.5 for each molecule. Although the inverse eﬀective masses ˜Aτ M are

splitting constants ˜Bτ for the C2(y)-odd levels τ = 101 and τ = 110.

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have presented a classical model for the behavior of a molecule immersed in superﬂuid; and we have
shown that the quantized version of the model has interesting features which should be, under certain conditions,
spectroscopically detectable.
In particular, chiral molecules can act as “quantum propellers,” coupling linear and
angular momenta via their interaction with the superﬂuid medium, and this leads to a characteristic splitting of
spectral lines. Our model simpliﬁes the superﬂuid dynamics greatly, which presumably aﬀects the quantitative
accuracy of our results. We will conclude by discussing possible remedies for the shortcomings of our model.

One important physical eﬀect that we have ignored is the formation of structured shells of helium atoms around a

solvated impurity, which leads to a nonuniform ﬂuid density. The model can be naturally extended to include this,
by allowing the ﬂuid density ρf to vary spatially, while maintaining a time-independent proﬁle in the body frame.
This approach has been used by other authors to estimate the superﬂuid-induced increase in the moments of inertia
of linear or highly symmetric molecules.7,8 The eﬀect of a nonuniform density can be dramatic. For instance, SF6 has
I = 180 amu-˚A2 in vacuum, which increases by ∆I = 310 amu-˚A2 when the molecule is immersed in a helium droplet.
The model presented here gives ∆I < 25 amu-˚A2, an order of magnitude too small. By contrast, a calculation using a
nonuniform density predicts ∆I = 170 amu-˚A2, which is more than half of the experimental value.8 The comparison
demonstrates that a rigid body with solvation shells attached drags more mass when it moves than one without them.
It is tempting to speculate that the calculated chiral splitting constants ˜Bτ will also increase when a nonuniform
density is allowed; but this may not be the case, for two reasons. First, because the oﬀ-diagonal Hamiltonian matrix
ˆM −1 ˆG ˆI −1 to lowest order in ˆG, increases in the rotational-translational coupling tensor are counteracted by
ˆβ =
corresponding increases in the hydrodynamic mass and inertia tensors. Second, because attaching solvation shells to
the immersed body simply builds a larger rigid body, to some extent, and the constants ˜Bτ always vanish for a rigid
body. Therefore, while allowing a nonuniform ﬂuid density may alter our results, it is diﬃcult to predict the outcome
without performing a full calculation.

−

Microscopic details of the superﬂuid structure are also neglected by a continuum hydrodynamic approach. These
details are better treated by path-integral and diﬀusion Monte Carlo methods, which have proven successful in
predicting the rotational constants of immersed molecules.7 It is likely that the hydrodynamic mass and rotational-
translational tensors described here can also be extracted from such calculations, and this information would be a
useful complement to the hydrodynamic results. Monte Carlo methods could also be used to address another neglected
phenomenon: the quantum-mechanical tunnelling between left-handed and right-handed forms of a chiral molecule.
This may play a pronounced role in hydrogen peroxide, where the torsional ground state (a symmetric superposition
of left- and right-handed forms) is 11 cm−1 below the ﬁrst (antisymmetric) excited state.9 Because the splitting is so
large, comparable even to the rotational level spacing, the enantiomers are strongly mixed, making questionable our
rigid-body treatment of the molecule. We expect the surrounding superﬂuid to suppress tunnelling, but a detailed
calculation, without the assumption of rigidity, is needed for a quantitative assessment. The main diﬃculty in applying
Monte Carlo methods would be ﬁnite-size eﬀects: since translational symmetry is strongly broken in small droplets,
while rotational symmetry is preserved, the ﬁnite-size corrections to ˆM and ˆG are presumably more drastic than
those to ˆI. A number of other microscopic techniques have been applied to molecular impurities in superﬂuid droplets
(see Ref. 7 for a recent review), such as density functional theory, and these more elaborate methods may also be
applicable to the phenomena we have described.

Finally, experimental data would be extraordinarily useful in reﬁning the current model. The spectroscopic sig-
natures we have described should be present for any chiral molecule, but not all candidate molecules will have the
large splitting constants necessary to resolve the ﬁne structure. Nanodroplet experiments have been conducted using
many diﬀerent species of impurity molecule; Ref. 3 contains an exhaustive list. However, almost none of the studied
molecules are chiral, so it is not surprising that no quantum propeller has yet been seen. We have suggested hydrogen
peroxide (HOOH) as one strong candidate. Ideally, the present paper will provide suﬃcient impetus for more detailed
investigations, both theoretical and experimental.

APPENDIX A: CALCULATION OF FLUID TENSORS

For approximately spherical surfaces, it is possible to calculate the hydrodynamic mass, rotational-translational
coupling, and inertia tensors as perturbation series in the deviation from sphericity. Consider a surface at rs(θ, φ) =
r0 (1 + ǫ(θ, φ)). The surface normal times the area element is

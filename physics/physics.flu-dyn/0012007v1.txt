tation, where α is a constant, 0 < α < 1. Unlike the case α = 0 (the usual Eulerian
hydrodynamics), a ﬁnite value of α results in a ﬁnite energy for a singular frozen-in vor-
tex ﬁlament. This property allows us to study the dynamics of such ﬁlaments without
necessity in some regularization procedure. The linear analysis of small symmetrical
deviations from a stationary solution is performed for a pair of anti-parallel vortex
ﬁlaments and an analog of the Crow instability is found at small wave-numbers. A
local approximate Hamiltonian is obtained for nonlinear long-scale dynamics of this
system. Self-similar solutions of the corresponding equations are found analytically,
which describe ﬁnite time singularity formation with all length scales decreasing like
(t∗

t)1/(2−α), where t∗ is the singularity time.

1 Introduction

The question about possibility of ﬁnite time singularity spontaneous formation in solutions
of the Euler equation for ideal incompressible ﬂuid has been discussed for a long time [1].
At present moment this fundamental problem of ﬂuid dynamics is still far from a complete
solution, though some rigorous analytical results has been obtained [2]-[4]. The nature of the
presumable singularity is to be clariﬁed, although many theoretical scenarios for blow-up has
been suggested until now, as well as extensive numerical simulations have been performed
to observe the singular behavior (see [5]-[13] and references therein). As very probable, the
self-similar regime of singularity formation may be considered, which was ﬁrst recognized by

t)1/2, and the velocity
Leray in 1934 [1]. In this regime, all length scales decrease like (t∗
t)−1/2. As the result, a maximum of the vorticity behaves like
increases with the law (t∗
(t∗
t)−1. It is very important that the curvature of vortex lines in the assumed self-similar
solution should tend to inﬁnity in the vicinity of the singular point. This is consistent with
the result of Constantin and Feﬀerman [3] who have found that the blow-up of the vorticity
must be accompanied by singularity in the ﬁeld of the vorticity direction.

In this paper, we take the point of view that inﬁnite curvature of frozen-in vortex lines is
in some sense a more fundamental characteristics of hydrodynamic singularity than inﬁnite
value of the vorticity maximum. To illustrate this statement, we consider a class of models
of an incompressible inviscid ﬂuid, diﬀerent from Eulerian hydrodynamics, such that ﬁnite
energy solutions with inﬁnitely thin frozen-in vortex ﬁlaments of ﬁnite strengths are possible.
Thus, we deal with a situation when the vorticity maximum is inﬁnite from the very begin-
ning, but nevertheless, this fact itself does not mean something singular in the dynamics of
vortex strings, while their shape is smooth and the distance between them is ﬁnite. However,
the interaction between ﬁlaments may result in formation of ﬁnite time singularity for the
curvature of vortex strings. To study this phenomenon analytically is the main purpose of
present work.

It is a well known fact that absence in Eulerian hydrodynamics of solutions with singular
vortex ﬁlaments is manifested, in particular, as a logarithmic divergency of the corresponding
expression for the energy functional of an inﬁnitely thin vortex ﬁlament having a ﬁnite
circulation Γ and a shape R(ξ) (this is actually the Hamiltonian functional determining
entirely the dynamics of the system):

More important is that the self-induced velocity of a curved string in Eulerian hydrodynam-
ics is also inﬁnite. That is why we may not actually work in the framework of Eulerian
hydrodynamics with such attractive for theoretical treatment one-dimensional objects. The
situation becomes more favorable when we consider a class of regularized models, with the
divergency of the energy functional eliminated. It should be stressed here that in regularized
systems the usual relation Ω = curl v between the vorticity and velocity ﬁelds is no more
valid, and in this case Γ is not the circulation of the velocity around the ﬁlament, but it
is the circulation of the canonical momentum ﬁeld (see the next section for more details).
However, dynamical properties of a de-singularized system depend on the manner of regular-
ization. For instance, it is possible to replace the singular Green’s function G(
) in
1/r) by some analytical function which has no singular points near the real axis
(1) (G(r)
1/√r2 + ǫ2). In
in the complex plane (for examples by Gq(r)
that case we may not expect any ﬁnite time singularity because the corresponding velocity
ﬁeld created by the vortex string appears to be too smooth with any shape of the curve, and
this fact prevents drawing together of some pieces of the string. With such a very smooth
velocity ﬁeld, a singularity formation needs an inﬁnite time. In this paper we consider an-
other type of regularization of the Hamiltonian functional, when the Green’s function is still
singular but this singularity is integrable in the contour integral analogous to the expression

tanh(qr)/r or by Gǫ(r)

1. If α is not small, then we have actu-
with a small but ﬁnite positive constant 0 < α
ally rather diﬀerent models than Eulerian hydrodynamics. Nevertheless, such models still
have many common features with usual hydrodynamics, which are important for singular-
ity formation in a process of interaction between vortex ﬁlaments: a similar hydrodynamic
type structure of the Hamiltonian and a power-like behavior of the Green’s function, with
negative exponent. Therefore we believe that it is useful to investigate these models, espe-
cially the question about ﬁnite time singularity formation in the vortex line curvature. We
hope the results of our study will shed more light on the problem of blow-up in Eulerian
hydrodynamics.

This paper is organized as follows. In the Section II, we brieﬂy review some basic prop-
erties of frozen-in vorticity dynamics in a perfect ﬂuid, with giving necessary deﬁnitions for
theoretical conceptions used in our study. In general, our approach is based on the Hamilto-
nian formalism for frozen-in vortex lines [14]-[17]. Then, in the Section III, we perform the
linear analysis of stability for a pair of symmetric anti-parallel vortex ﬁlaments and ﬁnd an
instability at small wave numbers, analogous to the Crow instability [18]. In the Section IV,
we postulate a local approximate Hamiltonian for the long scale nonlinear dynamics of the
pair of ﬁlaments and present analytical self-similar solutions of the corresponding equations.
Those solutions describe ﬁnite time singularity formation, with the length scales decreasing
like (t∗
t)1/(2−α), and this is the main result of present work. In the Section V, we make
some concluding remarks about vortex ﬁlaments of a ﬁnite width, then about long scale ap-
proximation for systems with the Green’s function of a general form, and ﬁnally about how
it is possible to improve the approximation in the case of small α, when the unstable region
is narrow in wave number space. In the Appendix A, we write in terms of the special math-
ematical functions some integral expressions needed for calculation of instability increment
of the vortex pair. In the Appendix B, we provide details about the integration procedure
for the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations related to the self-similar solutions.

2 Hamiltonian dynamics of vortex ﬁlaments

To clarify a meaning of the suggested models (2) and to explain the theoretical method
used, let us remind some general properties of frozen-in vorticity dynamics in a perfect ﬂuid,
starting from the Lagrangian formalism [19]-[25], [14]-[17].

Let a Lagrangian functional

specify the dynamics of some incompressible medium
of unit density, with the solenoidal velocity ﬁeld v(r, t). Especially we are interested here in
systems with quadratic Lagrangians taking in 3D Fourier representation the form:

LM {

where M(k) is some given positive function of the absolute value of the wave vector k. This
expression should be understood as the kinetic energy on the group of volume preserving

3

mappings x(a, t), so that the velocity ﬁeld v(x, t) is deﬁned as the time derivative ˙x(a, t)
taken at the point a(x, t). It is clear that the usual Eulerian hydrodynamics corresponds to
the case M(k) = 1.

Due to the presence of the Noether type symmetry with respect to relabeling of La-
grangian labels of ﬂuid points [21]-[25], [14]-[16], all such systems have an inﬁnite number
of integrals of motion, which can be expressed as conservation of the circulations Γc of the
canonical momentum ﬁeld p(r, t),

along any frozen-in closed contour c(t), so that the generalized theorem of Kelvin is valid:

These integrals of motion correspond to the freezing-in property of the canonical vorticity

ﬁeld Ω(r, t),

The generalization of the expression (15) to a case of several ﬁlaments with the circulations
Γ(n) and shapes R(n)(ξ, t), n = 1..N, is straightforward: one should write a single sum over
n for the ﬁrst term and a double sum for the Hamiltonian.

It is easy to see that the Hamiltonian (2) corresponds to the function M(k) in the form

∼
The choice of the longitudinal parameter ξ is not unique, but this does not aﬀect the dy-
namics of the vortex string which is an invariant geometric object. Sometimes it is convenient
to use parameterization of the vortex line shape by a Cartesian coordinate:

M(k)

kα.

R(ξ, t) = (X(ξ, t), Y (ξ, t), ξ).

Then the choice D = (0, Y, 0) gives immediately that X(ξ, t) and Y (ξ, t) are canonically
conjugated quantities.

Hereafter, we will consider vortex ﬁlaments with unit circulation for simplicity. So
the symbol Γ, if appearing in some expressions below, will mean the special mathemati-
cal Gamma function.

Now, for some ﬁxed value of the parameter α, let us consider the symmetrical dynamics
of a pair of oppositely rotating vortex ﬁlaments, with a symmetry plane y = const. Due to

5

this symmetry, it is suﬃcient to consider only one of the ﬁlaments. It follows from the above
discussion that the exact expression for the Hamiltonian of this system is the following:

3 Crow instability for a pair of vortex ﬁlaments

The system with the Hamiltonian (19) possesses the exact stationary solution

X(ξ, t) = C(α, b)t,

Y (ξ, t) = 0,

(21)

which describes the uniform motion of straight ﬁlaments. Here the stationary velocity C(α, b)
is proportional to bα−1. But this solution appears to be unstable due to an analog of the
Crow instability [18]. In this section we consider the linear evolution of small perturbations
of the stationary solution, and derive the linear growth rate.

To perform the linear analysis of small deviations of the vortex shape from a straight

line, we need the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian (19):

In Appendix A, Aα(k) and Bα(k) are expressed through the Euler Gamma function Γ(x)
and the modiﬁed Bessel functions of the second kind Kν(x).

The dispersion relation between the frequency ωα of a small amplitude perturbation of

the ﬁlament shape and the corresponding wave number k is simply given by the formula

since the linearized equations of motion for Xk and Yk are

α(k) = Aα(k)Bα(k),

˙Xk = Bα(k)Yk,

˙Yk =

Aα(k)Xk,

as follows from Eq.(20). In Fig.1 we have plotted ω2

It is easy to see that at small wave numbers the product Aα(k)Bα(k) is negative. Indeed,

A general nonlinear analysis of the non-local system (19) is diﬃcult. Therefore we need
some simpliﬁed model which would approximate the nonlinear dynamics, at least in the most
interesting long scale unstable regime. In the next section, we suggest such an approximate
model and ﬁnd a class of solutions describing the formation of a ﬁnite time singularity.

In particular, this means that the slope of the curve with respect to the symmetry plane
should be small, and also Y should be small in comparison with the radius of the line
curvature. When Y = const, X ′ = const, Z ′ = const, this expression gives the same result
for uniform stationary motion as the exact Hamiltonian.

and they allow to obtain a simple explanation of the instability. On a qualitative level
of understanding, the reason for the instability is that if initially some pieces of the curve
were more close to the symmetry plane and convex in the direction of motion, then at
subsequent moments in time the curvature will be increasing because of smaller values of Y
and corresponding larger velocity, while Y will be decreasing due to the curvature. Thus,
the feedback is positive and the system is unstable.
In the ﬁnal stage of the instability
development, a locally self-similar regime in the dynamics is possible, because the above
equations admit the self-similar substitution

However, with this choice of the curve parameterization, the obviously existing symmetry
of the system (34) with respect to rotation in the x-z plane is hidden. For taking advantage
of this symmetry, cylindrical coordinates are more appropriate, with the angle coordinate ϕ

5 Discussion

We observed that in the systems (34) with 0 < α < 1, ﬁnite time singularity formation
is possible in the self-similar regime.
Inasmuch as the condition (35) for applicability of
the approximate Hamiltonian (34) is satisﬁed in a range of the parameter C related to the
self-similar solutions (50-52), we conclude that in the systems (2) self-similar collapse of
two symmetrical singular vortex ﬁlaments can also take place. The principal question is
whether it is also possible for ﬁlaments having ﬁnite width. If yes, then such solutions are
analogous to the assumed self-similar Leray’s solutions of the Euler equation. Though the
exponent β (40) diﬀers from 1/2, the diﬀerence is small if α is small. However, an important
diﬀerence exists between inﬁnitely thin ﬁlaments and ﬁlaments with ﬁnite width: inside the
last ones, longitudinal ﬂows take place, caused by a twist of the vortex lines constituting the
ﬁlament. Those ﬂows keep the width homogeneous along the ﬁlament if a local stretching
is not suﬃciently fast. This mechanism acts against singularity formation and, probably,
[It is worth mentioning here that for
in some cases it can prevent a singularity at all.
ﬁnite width vortex structures in the Navier Stockes frame, the usual ”outcome” result of
the Crow instability is vortex line reconnection [29].] Thus, a more-less consistent analysis
of the general situation should take into account, besides the dynamics of a mean shape
of the ﬁlament, at least the dynamics of the width and the conjugated dynamics of the
twist. Clearly, we do not need to consider α
= 0 systems, when we deal with non-singular
vortex ﬁlaments. It should be emphasized that an attempt to take account of ﬁnite width
1/√r2 + ǫ2 with
of the ﬁlament by simple using regularized Green’s functions like Gǫ(r)
a constant ǫ, giving correct results for long scale limit of the linearized problem, fails to
describe the dynamics in highly nonlinear regime.

∼

Also, we would like to note that a local approximation analogous to (34) is possible for
arbitrary Green’s function GM (r). The corresponding long scale Hamiltonian has the form

where the function FM (Y ) is related to the function GM (r) in the following way:

HM l{

FM (Y )√X ′2 + Z ′2dξ,

FM (Y ) = 2

The stationary motion with a constant coordinate Y0 = b/2 is unstable if the second deriva-

systems can exhibit locally self-similar collapse, if the asymptotics of the function FM (Y ) is
power-like at small Y : FM ∼
The ﬁnal remark concerns the possibility to include into the approximate long scale theory
eﬀects caused by the fact that the unstable range is ﬁnite in wave number space. Especially
this is important for the case of small values of α, because in that limit the condition (35)
for applicability of the Hamiltonian (34) becomes too restrictive. The idea how to improve
approximation is the following. In general, the exact expression for the Hamiltonian of a
pair of singular ﬁlaments, after integration by parts, can be represented as the half of the
integral over a surface Σ drawn between the ﬁlaments (one half inasmuch as we consider
only one from two symmetric strings):

Φ, which has the additive increment Γ =

because the canonical momentum ﬁeld p created by ﬁlaments is determined by a multi-
dl) after
valued scalar potential Φ(r): p =
passing around a ﬁlament. Also the equality div v = 0 is important for derivation of the
last expression. In the case of small α, we should just more carefully take account of the
contribution to the surface integral from the vicinity of ﬁlaments. As the result of such
consideration, we ﬁnd that for a better approximation it is suﬃcient to replace in (34) the
projection of the arc-length element by the entire arc-length element and, correspondingly,
use the Hamiltonian

In this Appendix, we explain how the solution (50-52) of the system (48-49) can be obtained.
Let us introduce the designations

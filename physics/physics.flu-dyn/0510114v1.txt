Abstract

Taylor–Goldstein equation ( TGE ) governs the stability of a shear-ﬂow of an
inviscid ﬂuid of variable density . Using a canonical class of its transformations
it is investigated from a geometrical point of view .

Rayleigh’s point of inﬂection criterion and Fjørtoft’s condition of instability
of a homogenous shear-ﬂow have been generalized here so that only the proﬁle
carrying the point of inﬂection is modiﬁed by the variation of density . This
fulﬁls a persistent expectation in the literature .

A pair of bounds exists such that in any unstable ﬂow the ﬂow-curvature ( a
function of ﬂow-layers ) exceeds the upper bound at some ﬂow-layer and falls
below the lower bound at a higher layer . This is the main result proved here .
Bounds are obtained on the growth rate and the wave numbers of unstable
modes , in fulﬁllment of longstanding predictions of Howard . A result of Drazin
and Howard on the boundedness of the wave numbers is generalized to TGE .
The results above hold if the local Richardson number does not exceed 1 / 4 ,

otherwise a weakening of the conditions necessary for instability is seen .

Conditions for the propagation of neutrally stable waves and bounds on the
phase speeds of destabilizing waves are obtained . It is also shown that the set
of complex wave velocities of normal modes of an arbitrary ﬂow is bounded .

Fundamental solutions of TGE are obtained and their smoothness is

examined. Finally suﬃcient conditions for instability are suggested.

1 introduction

The object of our study here is Taylor-Goldstein equation ( TGE ). It was dis-
covered by G.I.Taylor and S.Goldstein , independently and simultaneously , in
connection with their studies on ‘ parallel shear-ﬂow’ of a ﬂuid of variable density
( see Taylor 1931; Goldstein 1931 ) . It governs the stability of the ﬂow . TGE is
important because of its applications to oceanography and meteorology and
has received considerable attention in the literature on hydrodynamic stability
( see Drazin & Howard 1966; Drazin & Reid 1981 ) . It describes waves in the
ocean and clouds in the sky . Here we explore the fascinating mathematical
structure , that this equation is naturally associated with .

In the limit of vanishing density variation TGE collapses into the classical
equation of Rayleigh ( 1880 ) which has a well developed theory ( see Lin 1955 )
characterized by its elegance , close agreement with experiments and geomet-
rical ﬂavour . The fundamental result of this theory is the celebrated point of
inﬂection criterion of Rayleigh for the instability of a parallel shear-ﬂow .

Theory of shear-ﬂows has many beautiful results but much remains to be
( see Drazin & Howard 1966;
understood yet . The literature on the subject
Drazin & Reid 1981 ) is full of expectations that under suitable conditions the
characteristic features of Rayleigh-theory will carry over to TGE . There
also are laments to the eﬀect that the point of inﬂection loses its signiﬁcance
in the context of TGE . In spite of persistent and valuable attempts starting
with Synge ( 1933 ) , Yih ( 1957 ) , Drazin ( 1958 ) up to S . Friedlander ( 2001 )
( see Drazin & Reid 1981 ; Friedlander 2001 ) , these expectations have found
limited fulﬁllment . There also are standing questions . The predictions of
Howard ( 1961 ) are yet to be settled and it is not known if the well known
condition ( Richardson number is less than 1/4 somewhere in the ﬂow ) of
Howard ( 1961 ) and Miles ( 1961 ) is suﬃcient to ensure instability ( see Fried-
lander 2001 ) . Further there is no simple method for solving TGE . Thus there
is a need for a detailed investigation .

To understand TGE , we construct a large class of its transformations which
transform it into a canonical form resembling Rayleigh’s equation and develop a
method that yields information on stability via each transformation of the class .
The entire information is then focused upon the question of stability and made
independent of transformations and coherent . This results in a description of

2

the inner core of TGE . A central role in this description is seen to be played
by a characteristic function of the ﬂow , we call the ﬂow-curvature .

This analysis establishes the point of inﬂection criterion for TGE, general-
izes results from Rayleigh-theory , shows that the condition of Howard and
Miles does not ensure instability , proves the predictions of Howard ( 1961 ) ,
relates instability to the crossing of a pair of bounds in a deﬁnite order by the
ﬂow-curvature , examines the propagation of neutral and unstable waves and
yields fundamental solutions of TGE .

The stability of ‘ parallel shear-ﬂows ’ is an important problem in classical
theory of hydrodynamics . Many eminent investigators have contributed to its
understanding ( see Friedlander & Howard 1998 ) . TGE governs the stability
of a 2-dimensional parallel shear-ﬂow of an inhomogeneous ﬂuid .

We imagine an inviscid and incompressible ﬂuid of variable density ﬂowing
. Here the
axis is horizontal ˆı being

axis is vertical , directed upwards and the x

( x , z )-plane , between the lines

z = z2

z = z1

and

in the
z

Suppose at the point

−

( x , z )

the velocity of the ﬂuid particle is u(z) ˆı
and the density is ρ(z) . Thus a layer of the ﬂuid characterized by a ﬁxed
value of z has a constant velocity and density . It experiences a force due to
β(z) , exerted on it by the
buoyancy , proportional to the density gradient
neighbouring layers . These incompressible and parallel layers of the ﬂuid slip

smoothly on each other and generate a shearing movement in the ﬂuid . This
time–independent ﬂow is called a parallel shear-ﬂow and denoted by ( u , β ) .
The ( linear ) instability of a shear-ﬂow is perceived of in the theory of sta-
bility , as the existence of a harmonic perturbation wave , which vanishes at the
boundaries , whose amplitude grows exponentially with time and whose prop-
agation is permitted by the linearized form of the equation of motion of the
ﬂow— a nonlinear PDE due to E¨uler .

Only stable parallel shear-ﬂows are seen to persist in the laboratory or in
nature . Governed by the equation of motion , the unstable ﬂows even if they
be parallel to start with , soon become time–dependent and nonparallel .
This is because small and time–dependent natural perturbations grow with time
in these ﬂows . Thus stability is directly related to the question : which parallel
ﬂows persist ?

Here we adapt from classical hydrodynamics the well known criterion for the

stability of this ﬂow ( see Drazin & Reid 1981 ) , as a deﬁnition as follows :

A harmonic perturbation wave

is called a normal mode of the
ﬂow ( u , β ) if equations (1) and (2) have a nontrivial smooth solution w(z) .
ci = 0 . A
A normal mode is called unstable if
ﬂow is called unstable if it has at least one unstable normal mode and stable
otherwise.

and neutral if

ci > 0

( k , c )

The most

fundamental result on TGE was conjectured by Taylor in
1931 and proved by Howard ( 1961˙) and Miles ( 1961 ) . Howard transformed
TGE to prove that for any unstable ﬂow ( u , β ) , the ﬂow discriminant ∆(z)

Jain ( 1979 ) took a step further and replaced the semicircle by a semi-ellipse

of unstable modes is bounded above by √ ∆ max / 2 , generalizing a result due
to Hoiland ( 1953 ) ( see Drazin & Howard 1966 ) . Further he predicted that

The special case of TGE when u

was known to Rayleigh . In this case instability is expected due to gravitational
overturning if a heavier layer of the ﬂuid lies above a lighter layer . Rayleigh

The information on stability obtained from transformations of TGE is stated
in lemma [ 2 .1 ] . It is then restricted to a canonical class of transformations to
obtain propositions [ 2 .3 ] and [ 2 .6 ] . These have been developed in suﬃcient
generality in view of their many applications later in the text .

a weaker form , showing thereby that some of these ﬂows are stable . This class
of ﬂows is described by the following condition .

§ 4 .1 Existence of unstable ﬂows .

So many parallel ﬂows are believed to be unstable because they are not seen to
persist , yet very few can be proved to be so . The only known example of an
unstable parallel ﬂow with rigid and ﬁnite boundaries is a piecewise linear ﬂow
called a shear- layer ( see Drazin & Reid 1981 ) . The diﬃculty is that no general
result for the existence of solutions of Taylor-Goldstein boundary value problem
is known . A good beginning in this direction has been made ( see Friedlander
& Howard 1998 ; Friedlander 2001 ) but much remains to be done here . An
existence theorem will provide deep insight into the subject . We expect :

then the ﬂow is unstable .

I take this opportunity to remember my teachers with reverence and grati-
tude . It would have been diﬃcult to carry out this investigation without the
stable ﬁnancial support and unfailing moral support from my family . I express
a deep sense of gratitude for this gracious gesture .

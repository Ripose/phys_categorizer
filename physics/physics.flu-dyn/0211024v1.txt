Alternative statistical-mechanical descriptions of decaying two-dimensional turbulence
in terms of “patches” and “points”

Numerical and analytical studies of decaying, two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes (NS) turbu-
lence at high Reynolds numbers are reported. The eﬀort is to determine computable distinctions
between two diﬀerent formulations of maximum entropy predictions for the decayed, late-time state.
Though these predictions may be thought to apply only to the ideal Euler equations, there have
been surprising and imperfectly-understood correspondences between the long-time computations
of decaying states of NS ﬂows and the results of the maximum-entropy analyses. Both formulations
deﬁne an entropy through a somewhat ad hoc discretization of vorticity to the “particles” of which
statistical mechanical methods are employed to deﬁne an entropy, before passing to a mean-ﬁeld
limit. In one case, the particles are delta-function parallel “line” vortices (“points” in two dimen-
sions), and in the other, they are ﬁnite-area, mutually-exclusive convected “patches” of vorticity
which in the limit of zero area become “points.” The former are taken to obey Boltzmann statis-
tics and the latter, Lynden-Bell statistics. Clearly, there is no unique way to reach a continuous
diﬀerentiable vorticity distribution as a mean-ﬁeld limit by either method. The simplest method of
taking equal-strength points and equal-strength, equal-area patches is chosen here, no reason being
apparent for attempting anything more complicated. In both cases, a non-linear partial diﬀeren-
tial equation results for the stream function of the “most probable” or maximum-entropy state,
compatible with conserved total energy and positive and negative vorticity ﬂuxes. These amount
to generalizations of the “sinh-Poisson” equation which has become familiar from the “point” for-
mulation. They have many solutions, which must be obtained numerically, and only one of which
maximizes the entropy on the basis of which it was derived. These predictions can diﬀer for the
point and patch discretizations. The intent here is to use time-dependent, spectral-method direct
numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations to see if initial conditions which should relax
to diﬀerent late-time states under the two formulations actually do so.

INTRODUCTION

several years that

It has been known for

two-
dimensional Navier-Stokes (2D NS) turbulence with peri-
odic boundary conditions and at high Reynolds numbers
(in excess of a very few thousand) will relax to long-
lived, quasi-steady states whose topology is preserved
and whose energy decays more or less inversely propor-
tionally to the Reynolds number, computed with respect
to a box dimension and an rms initial turbulent velocity.
When this energy decay time is large compared to the
initial eddy turnover time, the quasi-steady state can be
reached at a time when the total energy decay is fraction-
ally small, though the enstrophy decay can be fractionally
large. It came as a surprise when, a decade or more ago,
a series of such computations [1, 2, 3] revealed that the
late-time quasi-steady state for an initially turbulent run
at a Reynolds number above 14,000 showed a pointwise
hyperbolic sinusoidal dependence between stream func-
tion and vorticity.

The prediction of such a dependence,

text of a mean-ﬁeld treatment of
line vortices
(or guiding-center plasma rods) had been given thirty
years ago
[4, 5] and has since been extended and
reﬁned in a series of investigations by several groups
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]: in
every case referring to ideal, non-viscous systems. The
system is Hamiltonian with a ﬁnite phase space, and it is
natural to apply Boltzmann statistics to its dynamics, as
originally suggested by Onsager [21] (see also Lin [22]).
The surprise came in the extent to which the ideal Euler
mean-ﬁeld predictions ﬁt the Navier-Stokes results. At
least one attempt was made to deﬁne an entropy for the
case of ﬁnite viscosity [23] but generated new puzzles of
its own.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, an alternative for-
mulation was given by Robert, Sommeria and Chavanis
[24, 25, 26, 27], by Miller and colleagues [28] and later
explored by Brands, Maassen and Clercx [29]. The prin-
cipal diﬀerence was that the vorticity ﬁeld was discretized
not in terms of delta-functions, but rather in terms of
ﬁnite-area, mutually-exclusive “patches” of vorticity, to
which Lynden-Bell statistics [30] could be applied. The
choice of parameters in the patch formulation is wider
than that of equal-strength point vortices, in that one
must decide in advance the size of the patches, and the
number of “levels,” or strengths, that the patches carry.
There seems to be no deductive mechanism for making

such choices, and so we stick with the simplest, taking
equal-area patches and never more than three levels, in-
cluding zero.

For readers not inclined to pursue the original refer-
ences for these formulations, which in some cases require
considerable mathematical sophistication, we oﬀer in Ap-
pendix A a summary treatment of the derivation of the
“patch” dependence of vorticity on stream function in
the “most probable,” or maximum-entropy, state. It is
attempted to do this using the least forbidding and most
transparent mathematics available to the purpose. We
show how in the limit of zero-area patches, the point de-
pendence is recovered. Thus the reader is being referred
to Appendix A for a derivation of the nonlinear partial
diﬀerential equations to be introduced in Section II as
candidates for the predictor of the most-probable state
of late-time decaying 2D NS turbulence.

Section II will summarize both the numerical method
(now well-known in its essentials), due originally to
Orszag and Patterson [31, 32], to which various sets of
initial conditions will be subjected. We will also describe
the motivation for choosing these initial conditions, in
terms of what we expect from them as possible most-
probable states. We will concentrate on initial conditions
for which it appears that the predicted outcomes using
point and patch entropies will be as diﬀerent as possible.
We will refer the reader to Appendix B for a description
of how the sinh-Poisson relation and its patch general-
izations are dealt with numerically (a non-trivial task).
Section III contains the main body of the results that
we have found. Among other unexpected features, we
have found a series of one-dimensional (1D) solutions to
the most-probable state equations, whereas the literature
up to now has dealt only with 2D solutions (“dipoles,”
“quadrupoles,” “octupoles,” etc.). There are cases in
which the entropies of the 1D solutions (which we call
“bars”) are extremely close to those of the dipole over a
considerable range of energy. Which is greater depends
on seemingly arbitrary choices, in the patch formulation,
such as the areas of the patches used. Classes of initial
conditions are found (not essentially turbulent ones) for
which relaxation to the “bar” states is observed. It will
be easier, in the context of the details of the solutions,
to illustrate the variety of behavior we have been able to
catalogue.

Section IV will be a summary of what we think we have
learned, and of what remains to be learned. One of the
more radical, if incidental, conclusions which we believe
may be extracted from these runs (to be discussed in
more detail later) is that in the context of the initial value
problem, all 2D NS turbulence may result only from its
having been there initially. Otherwise, it can come into
existence only through random external “stirring.”

We should caution the reader that the word “turbu-
lence” in this manuscript will be used in a somewhat
looser sense than is customary. It will not always mean
a state of the ﬂuid in which the kinetic energy is widely
shared by many Fourier modes. We have concentrated

2

on initial conditions which seemed to us most relevant
to producing eﬀects peculiar to the “patch” description:
namely, initial vorticity distributions in which a few ﬂat
levels of nearly constant vorticity could be readily iden-
tiﬁed. We expected, because of instabilities in the shear
ﬂows these represent, that turbulence of a typical broad-
band modal structure would soon be generated, as it is
in three dimensions. We found that instabilities could
indeed be activated, but often, broad-band turbulence of
the conventional kind was not the result. Instead, energy
spectra dominated by only a few low-lying (in Fourier
space) modes were nonlinearly dynamically converted to
Fourier spectra dominated by only a few (but diﬀerent)
low-lying modes. We have in fact found it nearly im-
possible to generate genuinely broad-band 2D NS tur-
bulence through instabilities, rather than through initial
conditions or externally-imposed stirring. Perhaps sur-
prisingly, the dynamical evolution involved sometimes,
but not nearly always, led to late-time quasi-steady states
that seemed to correspond to most-probable “patch” pre-
dictions: most interestingly, the one-dimensional “bar”
state, as will be seen. Broad-band, initially-excited tur-
bulence continued to lead to the classical dipolar late-
time state, as it has in previous turbulence simulations.

II. THE NUMERICAL AGENDA

We address ourselves to the long-time dynamics in two
dimensions (2D) of the Navier-Stokes equation in the
usual vorticity representation,

∂ω
∂t

+ v

ω = ν

2ω,

(1)

∇

∇ ×

· ∇
where the ﬂuid velocity v is to be written in terms of
the stream function ψ as v =
(ˆeψ), and ˆe is a unit
vector in the z direction. v has only x and y components,
which depend only upon x, y, and the time t.
In the
natural dimensionless units of the problem, the kinematic
viscosity ν may be interpreted as the reciprocal of the
Reynolds number, which we will specify in more detail
presently. The curl of v is the vorticity ω = (0, 0, ω),
which has only one component, also in the z-direction.
The stream function ψ and the non-vanishing component
of vorticity ω are related by Poisson’s equation,

2ψ =

∇

ω.

−

(2)

We note that dropping the ﬁnal viscous term in Eq. (1)
leaves us with the 2D equations of an ideal Euler ﬂuid.
We note moreover that a time-independent solution of
these Euler equations results any time ω is a diﬀerentiable
function of ψ.

We will work in a periodic box with sides 2π in length,
and will use the unit length 1 to deﬁne the Reynolds
number; thus our basic unit of length is roughly 1/6 of
a box dimension. The unit of velocity will typically be

(3)

(4)

a root-mean-square value of the initial velocity, and we
will attempt to make this equal to 1 whenever possible.
Thus ν in Eq. (1) may reasonably be identiﬁed with the
reciprocal of an initial Reynolds number, Re. We are
interested in values of Re of at least several thousand,
so that the ﬁnal term in Eq. (1) is formally very small,
except in regions of steep vorticity gradients. The “eddy
turnover time,” which we shall use as a unit of t, is thus
about 1/6 of a box dimension divided by an initial rms
velocity. It has been known for many years that under
such circumstances, the kinetic energy E, deﬁned by

E =

1

1
2

(2π)2 Z Z

v2dxdy

decays slowly proportionally to ν. However, the decays
of higher-order Euler-equation invariants constructed as
integral moments of ω, such as the enstrophy,

1

Ω =

1
2

(2π)2 Z Z

ω2dxdy,

appear to continue to decay at an
(1) rate; even a weak
dependence of their decay rate upon ν has not been con-
vincingly demonstrated. Note that both ideal invariants
are referred to unit volume, in the dimensionless units.

O

When high Reynolds numbers exist, then, the turbu-
lent decay of energy is seen to be very slow, relative to
any other identiﬁable ideal Euler invariant. When the
energy decay time is large enough to be well-separated
from the eddy turnover time, it is possible to observe
in numerical computations [1, 2, 3] that a quasi-steady
state is reached in a time over which the fractional decay
of energy is small (a few hundred eddy turnover times).
One might expect to ﬁnd a “selectively decayed” state,
in which the enstrophy to energy ratio is minimal [33],
and indeed, if one waits long enough, it can be analyti-
cally proved that such a state must be approached [34].
However, it was found [3] that long before that time,
the quasi-steady, slowly-decaying state that is reached
has a rather sharp one-to-one pointwise correspondence
between ω and ψ. The elucidation and testing of this
correspondence is the principal purpose of this paper.

Clearly, even though a slow viscous decay may be su-
perimposed on such a state with ω approximately a func-
tion of ψ, the state is also closely approximated by a
time-independent solution of the Euler equations. There
is no a priori reason why this should be so. It is a fact
we attempt to incorporate here into a coordinated set of
direct numerical simulations of Eq. (1) and a combined
analytical and numerical argument, based upon statisti-
cal mechanics, in pursuit of what the connection between
ω and ψ should be.

The reader is referred to Appendix A for a summary of
the statistical mechanical arguments. They depend upon
a discretization of vorticity in terms of delta-function
line vortices (“points”) or in terms of mutually-exclusive,
ﬁnite-area “patches.” Boltzmann statistics are applied

3

to the former, to deﬁne an entropy, or logarithm of the
probability of a state, and Lynden-Bell statistics are ap-
plied to the latter. The limit of zero-area, ﬁnite-vorticity
patches are points. Thus the patch formulation can be
viewed as containing the point version of the theory,
and either is or is not a useful generalization of it.
In
both cases, what results is a “most probable” dependence
of vorticity upon stream function. A mean-ﬁeld limit
(inﬁnitely-many points or patches, of arbitrarily small
strength) is then taken, to yield continuous and diﬀeren-
tiable functions ω(ψ). In Appendix A, it is shown that
for points, the resulting function is:

2ψ =

ω =

eα+−βψ + eα−+βψ.

The symbols α, β are Lagrange multipliers, which en-
ter via a maximization of the appropriate entropy subject
to the constraints of given energy and positive and nega-
tive ﬂuxes of vorticity. They are determined in principle
by demanding that the energies and vorticity ﬂuxes cal-
culated on the basis of Eqs. (2) and (5) or (6) match
speciﬁed values. In Eq. (6), the Kj are the “levels” of
vorticity corresponding to the diﬀerent sized patches, and
must be chosen somewhat arbitrarily. ∆/M is a ﬁxed size
of a “patch,” deﬁned in detail in Appendix A, and may
be chosen arbitrarily, within wide limits.

Both Eqs. (5) and (6) have inﬁnitely many solutions.
The physical ones are interpreted to be those which max-
imize the appropriate entropy from which they were de-
rived. The others represent local maxima, which, as we
shall see, may in some cases represent attainable states
in the computations.

The questions before us are:

•

•

•

How does one determine the entropy-maximizing
time-independent solutions to Eqs. (5) and (6)?

How close may we come to those solutions in a
dynamical computation that solves Eqs. (1) and
(2) as a time-dependent initial-value problem with
large but ﬁnite Reynolds number?

Are there noticeable diﬀerences between the pre-
dictions of Eqs. (5) and (6) and are there reasons
for preferring one to the other as predictors of late-
time turbulent decays?

It is to be stressed that all three questions are answer-
able not in the abstract, but only as a result of somewhat
demanding computations. There is no a priori reason
why Navier-Stokes turbulent decays should be predicted
at all by anything having to do with the Euler equations.
The latter will never be soluble, for continuous initial
conditions, over time intervals long enough to make ideal

solutions of much interest, because it is in the nature of
Euler codes, having no minimum physically-determined
length scale, to overrun their own resolution in a very
few eddy turnover times. If the predicted states had not
shown some empirical relevance to Navier-Stokes solu-
tions, there would be no justiﬁcation for this activity.

The dynamical code used here is of the now familiar
Orszag-Patterson pseudospectral variety [31, 32]. The
code is a parallelized MPI Fortran 90 version of an earlier
Fortran 77 code provided by W.H. Matthaeus (private
communication). It is fully de-aliased, using the shifted-
grid method. It has been run, in the runs reported here,
on the SGI Origin 3800 at SARA Supercomputing Cen-
tre in Amsterdam. Some of the simulations (resulting in
the “bar” ﬁnal state in section III B 1 b) have also been
recomputed with a diﬀerent pseudospectral Fourier code
(provided by Dr. A.H. Nielsen, Riso National Labora-
tories, Denmark.) These computations yielded the same
conclusions.

−

All runs resolve the Kolmogorov dissipation wave num-
ber based on enstrophy dissipation. Previously,
ini-
tial conditions for turbulent decay runs have tended to
use randomly loaded Fourier coeﬃcients in the spec-
trum or vorticity ﬁelds up to some upper wave number.
These have typically been chosen to match some cascade
wavenumber k-spectrum, such as the “
3” direct enstro-
phy cascade [15, 35] spectrum predicted by Kraichnan
[35]. The phases have been chosen from a random num-
ber generator. This has been done to achieve the most
disordered (in some sense) initial ﬁeld compatible with a
particular power spectrum. Several of the runs to be re-
ported later are in fact of this variety. Such an initializa-
tion can only yield a vorticity distribution that is analytic
in x and y, since only sinusoidal functions are involved,
even though the spatial dependence may be wildly ﬂuctu-
ating. Such a vorticity distribution can take on any par-
ticular value of ω only over a set of measure zero. For this
reason, one might imagine it would tend to de-emphasize
features that corresponded to the “levels” in the patch
formulation, over which the vorticity is supposed to take
on a constant value inside a compact area. Therefore, we
have also stressed initial conditions that have large, ﬂat
areas of vorticity, separated by thin regions, with as steep
spatial gradients between them as the code will resolve.
Our original intention was that these would correspond
to unstable laminar shear ﬂows whose instabilities would
subsequently generate turbulence. Somewhat to our sur-
prise, we have found it easy to produce shear-ﬂow insta-
bilities but not ones that led to turbulence, in the sense
of broad k-spectra. We have come to suspect that this is
a feature inherent to two-dimensional ﬂows, and perusal
of the literature has uncovered only three-dimensional
turbulence as a consequence of unstable shear ﬂows, but
not two-dimensional; but this must be left as a conjecture
rather than a demonstrated fact.

In any case,

in order to induce a large number of
Fourier modes to participate in the subsequent dynam-
ics, we have found it necessary, in the runs evolving from

4

vorticity distributions with ﬂat areas, to add signiﬁcant
amounts of random noise initially, in order to get a sub-
sequent k-spectrum that could readily be called “turbu-
lent.” Even then, some of the evolution we ﬁnd might
have its status as turbulence disputed.

So referring to Appendix A for the derivations of Eqs.
(5) and (6), and to Appendix B for the method of their
numerical solution, we proceed in Sec. 3 to a description
of initial conditions used in the dynamical runs, the states
to which they evolved, and their comparisons with the
maximum-entropy or “most probable” states that Eqs.
(5) and (6) imply.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Extracting Maximum-Entropy (“Most
Probable”) States

We ﬁrst summarize the results of the solutions of the
most-probable-state equations, derived in Appendix A;
the method of their solution is described in Appendix
B. The goal is not only to ﬁnd numerical solutions but
to determine which among the solutions has the highest
entropy for given energy and vorticity ﬂuxes. Generally
speaking, the entropies of states with more maxima and
minima have been seen to be less than those with fewer,
and we can be guided by this. But there are instances
where solutions of two diﬀerent topologies can be found
whose entropies lie very close to each other, as found by
Pointin and Lundgren [8] , and we must concentrate on
those.

We consider the point relation, Eq. (5) in the absence
of any conditions that would suggest asymmetry between
positives and negatives, so that the two Lagrange mul-
tipliers α+ = α− = α. The result is the sinh-Poisson
ψ dependence of which is shown
equation (a typical ω

2ψ = 2eα sinh(βψ), β < 0.

We also consider the patch relation, Eq. (6), special-
ized to the three-level case of vorticity levels
1, 0, and
+1. Again assuming symmetry between positives and
negatives (Fig. 1(b)), we have

The form of Eq. (9) makes it most susceptible to nu-
merical solution. Once it is solved, for a given value of
λ, we must keep in mind that in order to evaluate the
entropy associated with the solution, we must revert to
the parameters of Eq. (7), while guaranteeing that α and
β satisfy Eq. (11). Since for each ﬁxed value of λ2, we
have inﬁnite sets of possibilities for α and β, a recipe is
needed for choosing them. Since our goal is to plot the
entropy vs. energy for a ﬁxed value of the vorticity ﬂux,

Ωψ =

for the domain [0, L]
[0, L] (here we let L = 2π and
Ωψ = 1, for convenience), we must also be assured that
the solution we get for ψ satisﬁes this condition.

×

Fortunately, these two conditions can be satisﬁed si-
multaneously. Combining Eqs. (10), (11) and Ωψ = 1
leads to the conclusion that

to ﬁxed vorticity ﬂux of either sign. From Eqs. (13) and

we can draw plots of the entropy (Sψ) vs. energy (Eψ)
for ﬁxed unit ﬂux of positive and negative vorticity.

It is useful to introduce terms for the solutions of dif-
fering topology. For example, for a given energy and vor-
ticity ﬂux, the contours of stream function may look like
Figs. 2. Fig. 2(a) will be called the “dipole” solution.
Fig. 2(b) will be called the “quadrupole” solution, and so
on through higher “multipoles” that correspond to suc-
cessively higher (even) numbers of maxima and minima.
We have also found one-dimensional solutions as illus-
trated in Fig. 2(c). These one-dimensional solutions will
be called “bar” solutions, and there are also an inﬁnite
sequence of them, with basic periodicities 2π, π, π/2, ...
These states are obtained, as explained in Appendix B,
by iterating a trial solution with similar topology until
convergence is obtained.

It will turn out that it
is possible to ﬁnd either solution as a consequence of the
development of certain initial conditions, as we shall see

negative vorticity ﬂux is not in general satisﬁed.
We must return to the second step and change g
until the desired accuracy is obtained from Eq. (21)
with Ωψ = 1. Once this has been done, we are
then in a position to evaluate the entropy from the
algebraic expression (see Appendix A):

We may plot the entropy of Eq.

(22) in Fig. 4(a),
which is obtained by the choice of M/∆ = 3.7814, a
relatively large “patch” size. It will be seen that for this
large patch size, the entropy of the bar solution is greater
than that of the dipole, a diﬀerent conclusion than that
of the point calculation. However, if we reduce the size of
the patch, we ﬁnd that the result approaches that of the

7

point formulation. In Fig. 4(b), we see the result when
M/∆ = 25, and in Fig. 4(c) the result when M/∆ = 100,
where the maximum entropy state is again the dipole one.
Considering the very small entropy diﬀerences between
the dipole and the bar solutions shown in Figs. 3 and
4, it might not be thought surprising if the ﬂuid had
diﬃculty making up its mind which state to relax into.

Before turning to the results of the dynamical compu-
tations, we oﬀer a few observations on the relations of
the patch versions of the theory to the point version, and
to each other. It is clear from the derivation that in the
limit that the patch sizes become smaller and smaller, at
ﬁxed and ﬁnite separation, the point version of the theory
is recovered. Depending upon the number of levels cho-
sen for the patch formulation, there are many versions of
the most-probable-state patch equation; the three-level
version of Eq. (8) is not the most general by any means.
Each will have diﬀerent solutions. There is, however, no
apparent unique or practical prescription for how many
levels, or what size patches, should be used to represent a
particular initial analytic vorticity distribution with high
accuracy. It is not clear that it can be done without re-
quiring the patch size to shrink to zero, at which point
it becomes indistinguishable from a point representation.
In fairness, we should also say that there is another aspect
to the point formulation that is also ambiguous: namely,
there is no reason to choose the point vortices of the
mean-ﬁeld theory to be of equal strength.
If some are
of diﬀerent strength, Eq. (7) will also change. Keeping
these in mind, we turn now to the eﬀort to see some of
the solutions as consequences of direct numerical solution
of the Navier-Stokes equation.

B. Dynamical Solutions and Comparisons

We now present the results of dynamical, pseudo-
spectral-method solutions of the 2D NS equation, using
a resolution of 5122. The time step is 0.0005. The initial
energy, using the normalization of Eq. (3), is 0.5. There
is no hyperviscosity or small-scale smoothing of any kind.

1. “Dipole” and “bar” ﬁnal states.

a. Random, broad-band initial conditions. The ﬁrst
run we report here is essentially a reproduction of the run
of Matthaeus et al.
[1, 2, 3], but with a lower Reynolds
number (1/ν = 5000), corresponding to an initial Taylor-
scale Reynolds number

Rλ has increased to 3143 by the end of the run.

This run served as a benchmark for our parallelized
code in the beginning, and the McWilliams initial condi-
tions [38] can also be used as noise, with variable ampli-
tude, to be added to later simulations to break unwanted

total initial energy equal to 0.5.

The results were quite similar in all respects to those of
Matthaeus et al.
[1, 2, 3], so only a few ﬁgures (Figs. 5
and 6) are shown here. The contour plots of vorticity and
stream function relax to the familiar dipole ﬁnal states.
The left column of Figs. 5 shows the vorticity contours at
three separate times. The right column of Figs. 5 shows
the modal energy spectra, for the lower part of k-space
(the maximum k is 241) at those same times, exhibited
as three-dimensional perspective plots. They are initially
broad-band, but evolve as expected to be concentrated
in the lowest values of k. In Fig. 6, a scatter plot of ω vs.
ψ shows a good agreement with the hyperbolic sinusoidal
dependence of vorticity on stream function, as predicted
in the point formulation (Fig. 3).

b. “Bar” A diﬀerent, and interesting, evolution re-
sults (1/ν = 5000) if we initialize using the quadrupole
solution from Eq. (15). In this run, Rλ increases from
2391 initially to 4920 at the end. This is not predicted
to be the maximum entropy state from Eq. (22), or any
other equation, patch or point; and so should evolve when
initialized with some random noise. The quadrupole so-
lution was found to have a symmetry which persists in
time, and the noise, it is hoped, will permit that sym-
metry to be broken.
It was found that the symmetry
persisted until the noise was raised to quite substantial
levels. Figs. 7 are perspective plots of the initial vortic-
ity as a function of x and y, with and without the noise
added. The noise level in this case is about twice the
quadrupole vorticity, and its randomness should break
any symmetry that might be present.

Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the vorticity and stream
function contours that result from the initial conditions
shown in Fig. 7(b). The intermediate panel (t = 15)
shows no obvious connection to the symmetry of Fig.
7(a) or to that of the ﬁnal panels (t=1250) of Figs. 8
(the ﬁrst is odd about the center lines of the basic square,
but clearly, the t=15 state has no such symmetry). The

relaxation to the one-dimensional “bar” state at t=1250
has been quite robust in several such runs. Fig. 9 is
ψ scatter plot for the bar state. There has been
a ω
considerable decay of vorticity, as evidenced by the dis-
appearance in Fig. 9 of the high and low values visible
in Fig. 7(b). By t = 1250, the energy (E) has decreased
to 58.4% of the initial value.

When we consider the modal energy spectra in Fig. 10,
for this evolution, we see that both the initial and ﬁnal
states are dominated by four and two Fourier modes, re-
spectively. In fact, the evolution after t=40 has this char-
acter. The energy spectrum at t=15 is somewhat more
broad-band than either, but whether it should properly
be called “turbulent” may be debated; it never achieves
the fully broad-band character of the evolution shown in
Fig. 5, for example. The ﬁnal state achieved is consistent
with the maximum-entropy prediction of the “patch” for-
mulation for suitably large-sized patches (Fig. 4(a)), but
not with the same formulation for smaller-sized ones (Fig.
4(c)). The right column of Figs. 10 shows a histogram
of the vorticity at three diﬀerent times in this evolution;
it is in eﬀect a frequency distribution for the appear-
ance of various values of the vorticity over the plane, one
per computational cell in the 5122 array. It will be seen
that this distribution changes enormously over the course
of the run, which it cannot do, of course, in any ideal
Euler picture. Figs. 11 are binned plots of the angle-
averaged modal energy spectrum (E(k)) and enstrophy
(Ω(k)) spectrum at the three diﬀerent times. Fig. 12
shows the time history of several global quantities for
this run: energy, enstrophy, mean wave number (square
root of the ratio of enstrophy to energy), and square root

quadrupole plus large amounts of random noise into a
one-dimensional “bar” most-probable state. This state
is more probable than the dipole, according to a “patch”
analysis if the patch size is big enough, though it is not
for a smaller but ﬁnite patch size.

A similiar initial condition is used by Segre and Kida
[36]. However, their computation made use of hypervis-
cosity and appears not to have run long enough for the
proper late-time state to evolve.

2. Local maximum states

a. Evolution from a 64-pole initial condition. The
contrasting evolutions of the two initial states in the
previous sub-section naturally arouse curiosity about
whether there is a limit in which one behavior goes over
into the other. In this sub-section, we attempt an answer
to this by considering initial conditions which originate in
high-order multipole solutions of the patch formulation,
not maximum entropy states in either formulation, but
intuitively closer to the random initial conditions that led
to the dipole solution before, in the ﬁrst run reported.

There are four numerical solutions in this group, with
1/ν = 10, 000 for all four runs. They all originate in the
64-pole solution of the patch formulation, using the 3-
level equation, Eq. (15). The same conclusions that we
reach can also be reached using 16-pole initial states, but
we will not display those results here.

The motivation was to see if the high-order multipole

initializations would lead to “bar” ﬁnal states, the way
the quadrupole does. Intuitively, they would seem to be
closer to our picture of what true turbulence might look
like. The bar states are no longer found, but there are
“local maximum” entropy states that can be achieved in
the limit of low noise in the initial conditions.

First consider what happens to the 64-pole initial con-
ditions without any noise, as shown in Fig. 13. A
straightforward laminar evolution occurs, with the end
product (t = 250) being a one-dimensional bar state with
a total of eight maxima and minima. This state is essen-
tially dominated by one Fourier mode, as indicated by

in evolution from those shown in Figs. 7(b) - 12, whose initial conditions are superﬁcially similar. The low-k part of the Fourier

FIG. 20: Evolution of a 4-bar initial condition, plus random noise, that ceases to evolve (perhaps because of loss of nonlinearity
due to decay) before either a dipole or a bar ﬁnal state is achieved.

the essentially linear pointwise dependence of vorticity
on stream function. In Figs. 14, we show the evolution
of the same initial conditions with only a low level of
noise: 1/2000 of the amplitude of the 64-pole solution,
not visible on the t = 0 contour plot. In this case, fully-
developed turbulence does seem to result, with a dipole
ﬁnal state as the end result.

The third run in the group concerns the result of
taking the ﬁnal bar state (we raise the initial energy:
E(t = 0) = 0.5), without putting any noise into it, from
Figs. 13, and allowing it to run. This appears to be a
time-independent state, stable in the presence of round-
oﬀ error for the duration of the run, but not a maximum-
entropy state and not stable in the presence of noise of
15, which
greater amplitude. This is clear from Figs.
show the development of the unstable evolution induced
by putting on the same level of random noise as in Figs.
14, with a fully-developed turbulence and a dipole ﬁnal
state as the result.

There are thus some subtleties revealed by these four
runs. Bar ﬁnal states, predicted by the patch theory with
suﬃciently large patch size, do result from the evolution
of a patch quadrupole plus suﬃcient noise. However,
higher order multipoles from the patch formulation seem
to be unstable at low levels of random noise, and evolve
into dipoles, consistently. Still less easy to ﬁt into the
picture is the laminar evolution of the “local maximum”
64-pole state without noise into the bar state shown in
Figs. 13. Neither state is in this case an absolute max-
imum entropy one, though both are in some sense local
maxima.

b. Evolution starting from a sinh-Poisson quadrupole.
We have started several runs from initial conditions that
originate with a sinh-Poisson quadrupole state, with
1/ν = 10, 000. The ﬁrst is the quadrupole state without
any added random noise, and the others are the same
state plus smaller or larger amounts of random noise.

The zero-random noise initial conditions seems to be
stable and to remain in the same shape in the presence
of only round-oﬀ error for the duration of the run, as

reported previously [37]. Even after putting in enough
random noise to manifestly break the symmetry (Figs.
16), the quadrupolar shape is maintained for quite a long
time before breaking down into a dipole by t = 300. Figs.
17 are vorticity histograms computed at three diﬀerent
times, showing more concentration of ω near zero values,
characteristic of sinh-Poisson states. The ω
ψ scat-
ter plots shown in Figs. 18 also illustrate this feature.
Evolution of the global quantities for this run is shown
in Figs.
19, showing abrupt changes in enstrophy and
palinstrophy when vortex merger occurs, but otherwise
not displaying characteristics of turbulent behavior. Note
that energy is well conserved for this case. In this run,
the quadrupole persists for a long time because the en-
ergy is concentrated in the four well-separated vortices,
before breaking down into a dipole. This is noticeably
diﬀerent behavior than when we started with the patch
quadrupole.

3. Oddities

a.

A run (1/ν = 20, 000) that leads to an “unclas-
siﬁable” ﬁnal state is shown in Figs. 20. It begins with
a four-fold bar state, plus a considerable amount of ran-
dom noise, and ends at a state that shows features of
both dipoles and bars. A tentative interpretation of this
evolution is that the nonlinearity is simply exhausted by
the viscous decay before either evolution can be com-
pleted. Once the amplitudes fall below amounts or in
Fourier conﬁgurations at which the activity is eﬀectively
nonlinear, the pattern in place is “frozen” in its topology,
and can only slowly decay. The scatter plot has features
of both the point and patch predictions.

b.

Several other runs demonstrated odd features.
Metastable states were found that would persist for a
long time as a consequence of evolution that, though dis-
ordered, might be thought to be less than totally tur-
bulent. An example appears in Figs.
21. In this run
(1/ν = 12, 500), we began with a 16-pole solution of the

Several runs (1/ν = 10, 000) were carried out using
this metastable quasi-quadrupole as the basis for initial
conditions, plus a signiﬁcant amount of added random
noise. The evolution then was typically that the system,
after having lingered awhile, evolved into the dipole con-
ﬁguration.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We have set out to test the relevance of the predic-
tions of Eqs. (5) and (6) and their respective vorticity
discretizations to the numerically-determined, long-time
states of a 2D NS ﬂuid with Reynolds numbers of sev-
eral thousand subject to doubly-periodic boundary con-
ditions. Eq. (5) has been derived by modeling the vor-
ticity distribution as a mean-ﬁeld limit of equal delta-
function point vortices, while Eq. (6) models the vorticity
distribution as made up of ﬂat mutually exclusive patches
of an area whose choice is arbitrary. Both equations have
an inﬁnite number of solutions, characterized by diﬀerent

topologies, but for ﬁxed vorticity ﬂuxes and total energy,
all but one are only local maxima and there seems to
be always one uniquely deﬁned maximum-entropy pre-
diction. As seen in Figs. 3 through 4, it is sometimes a
matter of painstaking analysis to determine which state
this is, however. We did computational runs of two basic
types: runs with broad-band, totally disordered initial
conditions of the type previously investigated, and runs
originating from vorticity distributions that consisted of
large areas of nearly ﬂat vorticity patches plus random
noise to break possible unwanted symmetries. In the for-
mer case, there were no surprises: the previously found
dipolar late-time states inevitably resulted. This was
not the case for the second kind of initial conditions,
however. They did not generate broad-band turbulence
in which energy was shared widely among many Fourier
modes, but did exhibit considerable nonlinear activity in
which the energy remained primarily in the lower parts
of Fourier space. It is perhaps a semantic quibble as to
whether the evolution should be called fully turbulent.
This second class of initial conditions, in any case, ex-
hibited a more diverse range of possible behavior than
the broad-band initializations did, and often came close
to a late-time state that could be identiﬁed as one of the
solutions of Eq. (6). Most interesting of those was the
one-dimensional “bar” state exempliﬁed by Figs. 8 and
13; in the former case, it is attained with the help of
added initial random noise, and in the latter, without it.
As Figs. 3 through 4 illustrate, it may or may not be con-
sidered to be the most-probable patch state, depending
upon the choice of the patch size ∆/M , which seems to be
arbitrary. In any case, it is not the most probable point
state predicted from Eq. (5). In the ﬁnite-size patch the-
ory leading to Eq. (6), the arguments for it proceed from
“coarse graining” the Euler equation behavior and pre-
suppose a minimum observational scale below which ﬁne
spatial structure cannot be resolved. In a well-resolved
NS computation (presumably including all of the ones
reported here), there is no such scale, and observation of
all scales participating is feasible. Thus that the patch
formulation of Eq. (6), with a large enough value of ∆,
can predict a radically diﬀerent topology than it does
with a smaller ∆, and then substantiate that prediction
in a dissipative NS computation, is another of the accu-
mulating puzzles which remain to be deciphered. In our
opinion, there can be said to be an interesting 2D NS
regime to be explored that has opened up in these inves-
tigations in which nonlinear evolution, perhaps not fully
turbulent in the conventional sense, nevertheless leads
from one state that can be identiﬁed to another lami-
nar, late-time state that is quantitatively more probable
than its initial conditions: an essentially thermodynamic
behavior. The conditions for assigning this probability
remain incompletely deﬁned, and seem to us worthy of
further numerical investigation.

APPENDIX A: STATISTICAL MECHANICS IN
2D TURBULENCE

In this Appendix, we attempt to review the most el-
ementary calculations of the “most probable” vorticity
distribution, inside a periodic square, that is compatible
with a ﬁxed value of the total kinetic energy and ﬁxed
(equal) ﬂuxes of positive and negative vorticity. We do
this for the case of Lynden-Bell statistics, which can then
be specialized to Boltzmann statistics as a special case.
It should be emphasized that in both pictures, vorticity
is regarded as a pointwise conserved quantity, so that
viscosity is not involved.

Consider the problem of rearranging a continuous pe-
riodic vorticity distribution ω(x, y; t = 0) to constitute a
“more probable” arrangement of the vorticity elements.
This can only be approached through some kind of dis-
cretization. We consider coarse graining the vorticity dis-
tribution in the following sense.

Cut the periodic box into many cells of equal volume;
i will label the cells.The cells are of area ∆. The coarse-
grained vorticity distribution will be deﬁned by the num-
bers

ωi =

1
∆ Z Zcell i

ω(x, y) dxdy.

(A1)

We now represent the vorticity ωi
inside the ith cell
in terms of smaller sub-units. These can clearly either
have ﬁnite areas (“patches”) or zero areas (“points”).
We should be able to take the “patch” formulation and
achieve the “point” formulation by suitable limiting pro-
cesses, so we start with the patches. The ultimate ques-
if either, satisfactorily represents
tion will be which,
the long-time state of the Navier-stokes evolution of the
ω(x, y; t = 0) at high Reynolds number.
It is an aca-
demic and not-very-interesting question as to which one
better predicts the long-time Euler equation evolution of
ω(x, y; t = 0), since we can never compute that anyway.
Note that if ω(x, y; t = 0) is an analytic function and
we look at the set of points x, y at which ω takes on
any value ω0, say, that set is always a set of measure

−−

zero
i.e., zero area. So arriving at any ﬁnite number
of “levels” will always implicity assume that some kind
of “coarse-graining,” as in Eq. (A1), has already been
done.

1.

We now cut each cell up into equal areas (they do not
have to have any particular shape), each one the size
of a “patch.” We say Mi is the maximum number of
patches allowed in the ith cell. Without apparent loss of
generality, we can take all the patches as of equal area,
but we will carry along the index i on Mi. There is
no obvious theoretical basis for choosing the size of a
“patch,” ∆/Mi, except that it is far smaller than ∆, so
Mi ≫
We assume there are diﬀerent “strengths” of the
patches, though this will later come to seem perhaps un-
necessary. Let the superscript j represent the “species,”
or strength of vortices of type j, which will be called
K j. K j is the integral of the (uniform) vorticity of the
patch over its area. Let j = 0, 1, 2, 3...q, where K 0 = 0
(an “empty” site, with no patch in it), and q diﬀerent
strengths represented,which can be positive or negative,
but not zero. For convenience in notation, we will let
K j = Kj, hereafter, to avoid confusion with exponents.

The ﬁrst two terms of Eq.

the “point” theory. The last one is new, and is a conse-
quence of the ﬁnite area of the patches. If the “patch”
area shrinks to zero, the last term becomes an inﬁnite
additive constant,apparently, and the “point” entropy is
recovered.

Comparing Eqs. (A37), (A36), (A34), and (A33), it
seems clear that every choice of the M/∆ and the pos-
sible Kj will lend to a diﬀerent equation and a diﬀerent
ψ. There seem to be no compelling arguments as to why
one might be superior to the other in predicting long-
time Navier-Stokes behavoir, and no point in speculating
which will do a better job of predicting long-term Euler
equation evolution, since we can never know that. It is
perhaps worth remarking that if we want to shrink ∆
so much that there is no approximation involved in let-
ting the ωi of Eq. (A1) represent an analytic function
ω(x, y, 0), then the “points” are the only possibility. Ev-
ery “level” approximation of the type Eq. (A1), with i
bounded from above is already a function signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from ω(x, y, 0). For example, it has an inﬁnite
palinstrophy, and thus an inﬁnite intial enstrophy decay

cells.

A possible stategy is to search for intial conditions
where the presence of ﬁnite-area conserved “patches”
would seem to have the most important consequences:
Eq. (A33) with positive α. For example, in Eq. (A33),
which presumably can be solved numerically, choose an
“α” and a “β” which will give a relatively ﬂat scatter
plot (like Fig. 1(b)).

∼

Pick an M/∆ that is large enough that ψ seems slowly
√∆, but M
varying on the scale
1. This will give
a function ω(x, y) which is presumably well-represented
by patches, if anything can be. Do not pick the maxi-
mum entropy state but something like a quadrupole or
higher multipole which can be expected to break up and
generate turbulence when used as an initial condition for
Navier-Stokes code at small ν.

≫

There may have to be a small random perturbation on
those initial conditions to get it to go turbulent as soon as
possible. Notice that choosing α, β and M/∆ in advance
provides computable expressions for energy and vorticity
ﬂuxes. The ﬁrst question to ask is, what “ﬁnal” state
does the system relax to for large times – what does its
scatter plot look like?

The second question is, then, using those expressions
for energy and vorticity ﬂux in the sinh-Poisson code,
what does the ﬁnal maximum-entropy state look like –
its scatter-plot in particular? Is there any sense in which
the initially ﬂat areas of vorticity ﬂux are still there?
The same program could be carried out starting from
the more restrictive Eq. (A36).

A really convincing, but perhaps over-ambitious plan
would be to take the α, β and vorticity ﬂux from the
solution to Eq. (A33), and use them as input for gener-
ating a sinh-Poisson solution, comparing its scatter plot
with the one resulting dynamically.

APPENDIX B: SOLVING THE POISSON
EQUATION

The sinh-Poisson equation (Eq. (9)) has been solved by
a lot of people numerically and analytically (see Ref. [20]
and references therein). Probably the most direct way to
do it is to put the equation into spectral space and do
the iteration there:

(Ψn+1)k =

(sinh Ψn)k.

We show three solutions in Fig. 2. In addition to the
solutions exhibited, there are an inﬁnite number more,
characterized by more and more maxima and minima.
They are obtained by starting with a trial function on
(B1) that has the desired
the right hand side of Eq.
number of ﬁnal maxima and minima, as noted by several
authors: McDonald [20], Book et al.
[7], Lundgren and
Pointin [8]. Typically, the solutions with many maxima

19

and minima are lower entropy solutions, for ﬁxed energy
and vorticity ﬂuxes, and so we do not discuss them in
any detail.

The spectral method loses it advantage when we try to
use it to solving Eq. (15), because we might have some
step function solutions. Here we adopt the numerical
method used by McDonald [6].

The ﬁrst step is to get the nontrivial solution for Eq.
(15) with Ψ = 0 on a square boundary of [0, π]
[0, π].
Starting from a trial solution W (x, y), we get the solution
of v(x, y) from

×

subject to v = 0 on the boundary. Here

Then we can correct the trial solution:

until we get a suﬃcient accurate solution.

FIG. 24: A periodic quadrupolar solution may be used to gen-
erate a dipolar one, depending upon the spatial sub-volume
chosen, as shown. The value of λ
in Eq. (15) will changed
correspondingly. The procedure is somewhat involved.

Perhaps the most important change we made to Mc-
Donald’s methods [6] is using the quadruple precision

instead of double precision in the calculation (and this
is not a luxury on mordern computers). The accuracy
problem mentioned by McDonald in this method is over-
come. As a result, if we deﬁne the root-mean-square error
(RMS):

Our solutions can at least reach an accuracy of 10−7.

20

We may construct higher-order multipole solutions by
putting monopole solutions side by side with alternat-
ing signs, and achieve doubly-periodic boundary condi-
tions in this way, in a “checkerboard” solution, so that
dipole (Figs. 24) and higher-multipole solutions can be
constructed. There is some loss of accuracy in this pro-
cedure, and we have made sure that the accuracy of all
solutions is of the order of 10−6 (RMS) in our calcula-
tions.

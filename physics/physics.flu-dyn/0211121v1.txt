Abstract

We adress the problem of interactions between the longitudinal velocity
increment and the energy dissipation rate in fully developed turbulence. The
coupling between these two quantities is experimentally investigated by the
theory of stochastic Markovian processes. The so–called Markov analysis al-
lows for a precise characterization of the joint statistical properties of velocity
increment and energy dissipation. In particular, it is possible to determine
the diﬀerential equation that governs the evolution along scales of the joint
probability density of these two quantities. The properties of this equation
provide interesting new insights into the coupling between energy dissipation
and velocity incrementas leading to small scale intermittency.

Introduction

Important details of the complex statistical behaviour of fully developed turbulent
[1]. Especially the eﬀect of small scale intermittency,
ﬂows are still unknown, cf.
i.e. the phenomenon of ﬁnding unexpected frequent occurences of large ﬂuctuations
of the local velocity on small length scales, is an open problem.

It is commonly accepted that small scale intermittency is due to some kind of
cascading process: Kinetic energy which is fed into the ﬂow by external forces on
some (large) scale L is assumed to be in an equilibrium with the energy being
dissipated by viscosity on the smallest scale η. Inbetween the integral length scale
L and the dissipation scale η, energy is continuously transported towards smaller
scales by the decay of eddies [2, 3, 4].

The statistical properties of the turbulent cascade are usually characterized by
means of the diﬀerence between the velocities at two points in space separated by
the distance r, the so–called longitudinal velocity increment u(r):

u(r) = e [v (x + re, t)

v (x, t)] .

only: Sn
u (r) = f (ǫ, r). Assuming a constant rate of energy transfer, Kolmogorov
derived his famous result (furtheron referred to as K41) for the structure functions:
Sn

rn/3 [2].

However, as pointed out by Landau [5], there is no reason to assume that a
decaying eddy spreads its energy into equal parts. On the contrary, it is likely that
the decay of eddies is a stochastic process. As a consequence, the energy dissipation
rate ǫ(~x, t) is a spatially distributed random variable. Accordingly, experimental
studies yield signiﬁcant deviations from Kolmogorov’s prediction [1].

The statistics of the energy dissipation rate is usually investigated by the scale–

dependence of ǫr, the average of ǫ over a ball with radius r located at ~x:

ǫr(~x) =

VB

ZB(~x,r)

ǫ(~x′) d3x′.

(2)

Taking into account the stochastic nature of ǫr, Kolmogorov derived a modiﬁed
result for the structure functions which is in better agreement with experimental
data ([3], furtheron referred to as K62).

The statstics of the velocity increment can also be characterized by means of
its probability density functions (pdfs) p(u(r)). While for large scales r the pdfs
are almost Gaussian, the phenomenon of small scale intermittency shows up in a
stretched exponential–like shape of the pdfs on small scales expressing very high
probabilities for large values of
. Those deviations from the Gaussian shape are

closely related to the deviations of the structure functions from the K41 prediction
rn/3 and can be attributed to the stochastic nature of the average energy

dissipation rate, see for example ǫr [6, 7, 8].

∝

These results clearly show that ǫr has an important inﬂuence on the statistics
of the velocity increment. It would therefore be highly desirable to have an exper-
imental tool which allows for a precise characterization of the interdependence of
those two quantities. The aim of the present paper is to show that such a tool is
given by the framework of stochastic Markovian processes.

In a recent series of papers [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], the Markov analysis has been
applied separately to the velocity increment and the energy dissipation rate. The
idea, inspired by the cascade picture, is to consider the velocity increment u(r) (or
the energy dissipation rate ǫr) as a stochastic variable which evolves in the scale r.
If u(r) fulﬁlls the mathematical condition for a Markov process, the evolution of u in
r can be described by means of the Fokker–Planck equation, a generalized diﬀusion
equation for the pdf p(u(r)) in the variables r and u. This equation is completely
determined by two coeﬃcients, drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcient, respectively, which
can be estimated from experimental data. The Markov analysis thus provides a
possibility to measure the stochastic diﬀerential equations governing the evolution
of the stochastic variable u in the scale r without incorporating any models or
assumptions on the physics of the systems. A detailed explanation of this method
is presented in [11].

The mathematics of Markov processes can be generalized to multidimensional
stochastic variables. In the present paper, we use the mathematical theory of mul-
tidimensional Markovian processes to establish an uniﬁed description of the joint
statistical properties of the velocity increment and the averaged energy dissipation
rate. Analysing experimental data, we derive a Fokker–Planck equation describ-
ing the evolution of the joint pdf p(u(r), ǫr) in the scale r. The properties of this
equation provide interesting new insights into the interdependence of the velocity
increment and the averaged energy dissipation rate. In particular we diﬀerentiate
between deterministic and stochastic coupling.

The paper is organized as follows: First, we shortly summarize the mathemat-
ical formulation of multidimensional Markovian processes in section 2. Section 3

2

brieﬂy recalls the results of the one dimensional analysis for the velocity increment
and the averaged energy dissipation rate, respectively. A short description of the
experimental set–up and the data is presented in section 4 while the results of the
two dimensional Markov analysis are given in section 5. A short summary and
discussion of our results in section 6 will conclude the paper.

2 The mathematics of Markov processes

This section gives a brief summary of the theory of multidimensional Markovian
processes. For a detailled discussion of the theorems summarized here, we refer the
reader to standard textbooks like [15].

We consider the two dimensional stochastic variable q(r) which is deﬁned as:

q(r) =

u(r)
x(r)

.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(3)

Here, x(r) is the logarithm of the energy dissipation rate ǫr normalised by its (scale
independent) expectation value: x(r) = ln (ǫr/¯ǫ).

The stochastic process underlying the evolution of q(r) in the scale r is Marko-

p ( q(r1)

q(r2), q(r3), ..., q(rn) ) = p( q(r1)

q(r2) ) .

(4)

|

|

|

p ( q(r1)
q(r2), q(r3), ..., q(rn) ) denotes the probability for ﬁnding certain values
for u and x at some scale r1, provided that the values of q at all larger scales
r2, r3, . . . , rN are known. The condition (4) simply states that the transition from
an eddy at scale r2 characterized by u(r2) and x(r2) to the ”state” q(r1) at scale
r1 should not depend on what happens at larger scales.

If the conditional pdfs fulﬁll the Markov condition (4), any N –point distribution

of q can be expressed as a product of conditional pdfs:

p ( q(r1), q(r2), ..., q(rN ) ) = p ( q(r1)

q(r2) )

Equation (5) is a remarkable statement: The knowledge of the conditional pdf
p ( q(r)

any N –point pdf of q, i.e.: the entire information about the stochastic process is
encoded in the conditional pdf.

Furthermore, it is well-known that for Markov processes the evolution of the
conditional pdf in the scale r can be described by the Kramers-Moyal expansion, a
partial diﬀerential equation for p ( q(r)
q0(r0) ) in the variables q and r. According
to Pawula’s theorem, this expansion truncates after the second term if the fourth

found in the deﬁnition (8) of the conditional moments M(k).

By multiplying the Fokker–Planck equation with p(q0, r0) and integrating with
respect to q0, it can be shown that the same equation also describes the r–evolution
of the pdf p(q, r). Mathematically, the drift vector D(1) and the diﬀusion matrix

The coeﬃcients M(k) are nothing but conditional expectation values of the veloctiy
increment and the energy dissipation rate, respectively, and can easily be determined
from experimental data. One may therefore hope to ﬁnd estimates for the D(k) by
extrapolating the measured conditional moments M(k) towards ∆r = 0 [11], see
also [16, 17].

Alternatively, the stochastic process underlying the evolution of the variable q
in the scale r can be described by the Langevin–equation, an ordinary stochastic
diﬀerential equation for q(r):

It can be shown that a variable which is described by eq.

the process.

Markovian, if and only if the Γi(r) are δ–correlated stochastic forces with zero

δ–correlated white noise, the Kramers-Moyal expansion stops after the second term

In that case the functions f (q, r) and g(q, r) can be calculated from the drift
vector D(1) and the diﬀusion matrix D(2). In Itˆo’s formalism of stochastic calculus,
f (q, r) and g(q, r) are given by

where √D(2) is to be calculated by diagonalizing the matrix D(2), taking the square
root of each element of the diagonalized matrix and transforming the result back
into the original system of coordinates.

The Langevin–equation oﬀers an alternativ way to check the Markovian prop-
erties of a stochastic variable. The idea which was originally proposed in [18] is to
estimate the coeﬃcients D(1) and D(2) from experimental data according to equa-
tions (8) and (7) and to calculate the functions f and g according to equation (10).

4

Having determined f and g in that way, the Langevin–equation (9) can be used
to extract Γ(r) from the (measured) derivatives of the qi(r). If the realizations of
the stochastic force obtained by this method are δ–correlated with zero mean and a
Gaussian distribution, the process is governed by the Fokker-Planck equation. We
will use this method here instead of the one proposed in [11], since for multidimen-
sional stochastic variables it is hardly possible to check the Markov condition (4)
directly by means of multiconditional pdfs. Also the numerical cost for the estima-
tion of the coeﬃcients D(k) of order three and higher grows considerably with the
order k (growth like 2k).

3 The results of the one dimensional Markov anal-

ysis

Here we brieﬂy recall the results of the one dimensional analysis for the velocity
increment and the energy dissipation rate, respectively. Detailled discussions of the
results for the velocity increment can be found in refs.
[9, 10, 11, 19], for recent
results on the Markov analysis of the energy dissipation rate we refer to [12, 13].

In the case of the one dimensional analysis of the velocity increment, the Markov
condition (4) was found to be valid for scales ri and diﬀerences of scales ∆r =
ri larger than a certain scale lmar, which is of the order of magnitude of
ri+1 −
the Taylor microscale λ. The turbulent cascade thus exhibits an elementary step
size. This phenomenon may be seen in analogy to the mean free path of molecules
undergoing a Brownian motion.

Within the range of scales for which the Markovian properties are fulﬁlled, i.e.

for ∆r > λ, the conditional moments

of the velocity increment show a linear dependence (with small second order cor-
rections) on ∆r and can thus be extrapolated towards ∆r = 0. Furthermore, it can
be shown that the fourth order coeﬃcient D(4) does not have an important inﬂu-
ence on the evolution of p(u, r) and can be neglected [11]. The pdf of the velocity
increment is therefore governed by the Fokker–Planck equation:

p(u, r) =

D(1)(u, r)p(u, r)

respectively:

When the scale r is given in units of the Taylor microscale λ, the linear term γ
of D(1) exhibits an universal dependence on scale r, independent of the Reynolds
number [19, 20]:

The coeﬃcients α(r) and δ(r) are linear functions of the scale r with slopes which
decrease with increasing Reynolds number. The quadratic term β shows an only
weak dependence on r but increases signiﬁcantly with Re [19, 20].

The analogous analysis for the energy dissipation rate [12, 13] shows that the
pdf p(x, r) of the logarithmic energy dissipation rate x(r) is also governed by a

Again, the drift coeﬃcient D(1) shows a linear dependence on its argument x, albeit
with a positive slope and an additional constant term:

D(1)(x, r) = F (r) + G(r)x.

(16)

In [12, 13] the scale dependence of the coeﬃcients F and G was expressed by means
of the invers logarithmic scale l = ln (L/r). Rewritten in terms of the linear scale
r, the parametrizations given in [12, 13] read:

(cid:17)

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(2)(x, r) can in a ﬁrst order approximation taken to be
constant in x [12] but is found to depend on the scale r [13]:

With a diﬀusion coeﬃcient that does not depend on x, the solutions of the Fokker–
Planck equation (15) are Gaussian [15], i.e. the pdf of the averaged energy dissipa-
tion rate is lognormal in agreement with Kolmogorov’s [3] assumption. But it also
follows from eqs. (15), (16), (17) and (18) that the standard deviation of this pdf is
not described by a logarithmic dependence as assumed by Kolmogorov to provide
scaling behaviour [13]. It can also be seen from experimental data that the constant
value for D(2)(x, r) according to eq. (18) is a ﬁrst order approximation; the data
presented in [12] (ﬁg. 2) reveal a weak but nonetheless signiﬁcant dependence on x.

4 The experimental setup

The data set used for the analysis consists of 108 samples of the local velocity mea-
sured in a cryogenic axisymmetric helium gas jet at a Reynolds number of 115000.
The measurement was done in the center of the jet at a vertical distance of 40D
(D = 2mm is the diameter of the nozzle) from the nozzle using a specially adapted
hotwire anemometer with a spatial resolution of 3.4µm [21, 22]. We use Taylor’s hy-
pothesis of frozen turbulence to convert time lags into spatial displacements. With
the sampling frequency of 91.9kHz and a mean velocity of 0.62m/s, the spatial
resolution of the measurement is 6.8µm. Following the convention chosen in [11],
velocities and velocity increments are given furtheron in units of σ∞. It is deﬁned
as σ∞ = √2σ, where σ is the standard deviation of velocity ﬂuctuations. For the
data set under considerations, σ∞ = 0.2m/s.

For the integral length scale L we obtain a value of 3.5mm, the Taylor microscale
λ is 120µm and the dissipation scale η was estimated to be approximately 6µm.
For further details on the experimental setup we refer the reader to [21, 22].

The energy dissipation rate is estimated by its one–dimensional surrogate [1]

(20)

As the dissipative scale η is resolved by the measurement (the resolution of the
sensor is 3, 4µm, while η is approximately 6µm), it is in principle allowed to set
∆ = 1 (in units of samples). However, from the wave number spectrum of the data
shown in ﬁgure 1, it becomes evident that the measurement is dominated by white
noise for small scales (below ∆
5), which would lead to incorrect results for the
energy dissipation rate if ∆ = 1 was used to estimate ∂v/∂x.

We therefore applied a digital low pass ﬁlter to the data multiplying the Fourier

coeﬃcients with the spectral ﬁlter function

φ(k) =

(21)

The cutoﬀ wave number was chosen to be k0 = 0.2, according to the observed
transition to white noise for wave numbers k > 0.2 (see ﬁg. 1 which also displays
the power spectrum of the ﬁltered data set). Details on the method can be found
in [23].

A digital ﬁlter is of course a serious manipulation of the data and it is by no
means obvious that the smoothed data represent the ”real” velocity signal in a better
approximation than the original data set. Therefore we compared the various results
obtained from the original and the smoothed data. In both cases we used ∆ = 5
for the estimation of the energy dissipation rate. It is found that for both cases
the coeﬃcients D(k) show the same functional dependencies on their arguments u,
x and r. Thus the coeﬃcients calculated from the original and smoothed data set,
respectively, are identical up to constant factor [20]. For the purpose of the analysis
presented in this paper, these eﬀects are of no importance. We therefore restrict
the discussion to the results obtained from the smoothed signal. For the ﬁltered
data set, the mean energy dissipation rate ¯ǫ is 0.52m2/s3.

Figure 3(a) shows the result of the extrapolation for D(1)

u (u, x, r) at scale r = L/2
for various values of x as a function of the velocity increment u. The u–component of

variations for diﬀerent values of x. To a ﬁrst order approximation, the dependence
of D(1)

u on x can thus be neglected and we obtain:

(23)

The slope ˜γ(r), which for a given scale r is obtained by averaging the results of
the ﬁts (23) for diﬀerent x, has a value of 1.1 at the scale r = L/2. By performing
this procedure at several scales r we are able to specify the scale dependence of
˜γ(r), see ﬁg. 3(b). It turns out that the function ˜γ(r) is identical with the slope
γ(r) of the drift coeﬃcient of the one dimensional Fokker–Planck equation (13) for
p(u, r).

The ﬁnding that ˜γ(r) is identical with the one dimensional coeﬃcient γ(r) may
be surprising at ﬁrst sight, but is a direct consequence of the fact that D(1)
u does
(approximately) not depend on x. This can be seen by considering the Fokker–
Planck equation (6) for the joint pdf p(u, x, r):

Even though the formulation (31) of the twodimensional Langevin–equation is yet
incomplete, it can already be used to extract the u–component Γu(r) of the stochas-
tic force from measured realizations of u(r), ∂
∂r u(r) and x(r). These calculations
are faciliated by the fact that the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(2)
uu does not depend on
the velocity increment u. It is therefore not necessary to distinguish between the
various deﬁnitions of stochastic calculus (Itˆo and Stratonovich, respectively), and a
simple Euler–scheme can be applied to calculate Γu(r) (for details on the numerical
scheme see, for example, [13]).

The stoachstic process governing the r–evolution of the stochastic variable q(r) is
Markovian, if the stochastic force Γ is δ–correlated. However, as can be seen in ﬁgure
7, the autocorrelation function RΓ(∆r) of the stochastic force Γu(r) exhibits nonzero
λ. This clearly indicates that the Markovian properties are
values up to ∆r
fulﬁlled for scales r (and diﬀerences of scales ∆r) larger than the Taylor microscale
λ only. Again, we recall that this result is in agreement with the one dimensional
analysis of the velocity increment (see [11]).

To complete the description of the turbulent cascade by the Markov analysis,
we still have to determine the coeﬃcients D(1)

ﬁg. 8(a) for exemplarily chosen values of u, x and r, the ﬁrst order coeﬃcient M (1)

Since the coeﬃcient D(1)
x does not depend on u, it has to be identical with the
coeﬃcient D(1) of the one dimensional Fokker–Planck equation (15) for p(x, r).
This follows from an analogous consideration leading to equation (25).

Note that these parametrizations diﬀer from those given for the one dimensional
coeﬃcients in equation (17). However, the discrepancy between the results given
in (33) and (17) must not be taken too serious.
In [13] F and G were plotted
in terms of the invers logarithmic length scale l = ln (L/r), which may suggest a
diﬀerent functional dependence of those coeﬃcients on the scale than it is found
here. Furthermore, a data set at Rλ = 341 was used, whereas for the data set
used here the Taylor–Reynolds number is 463. In addition, as mentioned above,
numerical values such as those for F (r) and G(r) strongly depend on the method
chosen to estimate the derivative ∂v

∂x (see chapter 4).
The last coeﬃcient which remains to be calculated is the xx–component of the

diﬀusion matrix. Unfortunately, the estimation of D(2)

to be parametrized; the data can be ﬁtted with several functions (Gaussian as well
as Lorentzian distributions, for example) with almost equal accuracy. The ques-
tion of whether one of these functions is to be preferred requires further detailled
experimental as well as theoretical investigations and is the subject of an ongoing
study.

6 Conclusion and Comments

Although further investigations will be necessary to complete the two dimensional
Markov analysis of the turbulent cascade, the results obtained so far already allow
for several interesting statements on the joint statistical properties of the longitu-
dinal velocity increment and the averaged energy dissipation rate.

A particularly remarkable result is obtained for the u–component D(2)

uu of the
diﬀusion matrix, which is found not to depend on the velocity increment. This
means that if the averaged energy dissipation rate ǫr was not a stochastic variable
but constant, the pdf of u(r) would reduce to a rather simple Gaussian distribu-
tion. The eﬀect of small scale intermittency can thus clearly be traced back to the
stochastic nature of ǫr.

So far, our results are in accordance with earlier experimental investigations
[7, 8] as well as with the assumptions underlying Kolmogorov’s models. Signiﬁcant
new information, however, are found for the u–component of the drift vector. We
found that D(1)
u (u, x, r) does not depend on the energy dissipation rate, in a ﬁrst
order approximation. This means that this coeﬃcient is identical with the drift
term of the one dimensional Fokker–Planck equation for p(u, r), i.e.
it reveals a
linear dependence on u with a slope γ(r) given by eq. (14). With respect to the
works [9, 10, 24, 25] it remains open to explain why γ deviates from the value 1/3.
x does not depend
on the velocity increment u and is a linear function of the logarithmic energy dissi-
pation rate x as speciﬁed by eq. (32). One thus obtains a system of two stochastic
diﬀerential equations for the evolution of u and x in r which are linked only via

A further new important result is that the drift coeﬃcient D(1)

Compared to the one dimensional Langevin–equation, the stochastic part of the
equation for u(r) is considerably simpler for the two dimensional process. Note also
that the resulting equation for the evolution of u(r) in two dimensions is symmetric
in u
(35) would be symmetric
in u, thus leading to vanishing odd order moments. Asymmetries of the velocity
increment, which are of importance in Kolmogorov’s four–ﬁfths law, can thus clearly
be attributed to the inﬂuence of the energy cascade.

more complex dependence on its arguments (see ﬁg. 11) than the one dimensional
coeﬃcient D(r). Whether the dependence of D(2)
xx on x is in fact given by the rather
complex form indicated in ﬁg. 11(b) is yet an open problem which requires further
discussions of the experiemental uncertainties. However, it is also conceivable that
an even more complete characterization of the turbulent cascade has to include the
transversal velocity increment as well. Such a three–dimensional analysis might
lead to further simpliﬁcations of the diﬀusion terms.

Nevertheless, the results obtained so far give reason to believe that the math-
ematical framework of stochastic Markovian processes is a suitable tool for exper-
imental investigations concerning the joint statistical properties of velocity incre-
ments and the energy dissipation rate in fully developed turbulence. As it is known
that the Fokker–Planck equation holds for the conditional pdf as well, the knowl-
edge of this equation also provides all information about any N–scale joint pdf of x
and u, see equations 5 and 6. Thus any general moment of u(r)αx(r′)β is known.
In this way the phenomenological Fokker–Planck equation derived from the data
provides a closed description for all moments on all scales.

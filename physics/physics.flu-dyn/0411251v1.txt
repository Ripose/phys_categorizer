Some important concepts in the nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence are presented in this
article. The structure of point, on which diﬀerential equations are deﬁned, is analyzed. The
distinction between the uniform point and the non-uniform point, as well as between the standard
point and the nonstandard point, is showed. A new kind of equations, which diﬀer essentially from
those in existent theory, is emphasized. These new equations can hold at non-uniform points. One
case in point for the nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence is given too.

A new approach, the nonstandard picture, to the theory of turbulence

was presented in the paper [1]. The nonstandard analysis theory of turbu-

lence(NATT) is based on the nonstandard analysis mathematics. The theory

shows that in a laminar ﬂow, a particle of ﬂuid is taken as uniform wholly, and

there does not exist any structure in the particle; on the other hand, a particle

of ﬂuid in a turbulent ﬁeld should not be uniform wholly and some interior

structure occurs. By this concept, other important concepts of physics and

mathematics in NATT can be drawn reasonably. We will state these concepts

as follows.

(A)On the concept of “point”

When physical phenomena (e.g., complex phenomena) are studied, peo-

ple’s attention is usually concentrated on inquiry into the characteristic of the

equations, governing the phenomena, and their solutions. Is it possible that

1

the phenomena are discussed from other angle? It is well known that dif-

ferential equations are always deﬁned on and applicable to points. A point

in mathematics is absolute geometric point; but a physical point, in fact, is

micro-volume. And a physical point, in some cases, has the structure in it.

Therefore, we could observe and comprehend physical phenomena from the

angle of analyzing the nature of the point, to which the governing equations

of the phenomena are applied.

Point is an abstract concept of mathematics, surely the concept of point

is drawn from objective physical reality.

In ﬂuid mechanics, for example, a

particle of ﬂuid is taken, in the abstract, as a point.

In a laminar ﬂow, a

point(a particle of ﬂuid) is uniform and no structure exists through the par-

ticle. Otherwise, in turbulence, a point (a particle of ﬂuid) possesses interior

structure and is non-uniform. A particle of ﬂuid in the two cases, laminar ﬂow

and turbulence, is abstracted as a point. However, the former is uniform point

and the latter non-uniform point. Every point(particle of ﬂuid), which has

interior structure under some conditions, is formed of numerous ﬂuid-particles

in lower level. A ﬂuid-particle in lower level still can be thought of as uniform

and abstracted as a uniform point. Yet every point(particle of ﬂuid) of a ﬂow

ﬁeld is called as monad; and a ﬂuid-particle in lower level is called as an interior

point of the monad in paper [1].

Moreover, a particle of ﬂuid is called as a standard point and a ﬂuid-particle

in lower level as a nonstandard point. A standard point(monad) corresponds

to a real number, and a nonstandard point to a nonstandard number in pa-

per [1]. Here we give the other meaning of standard points. Every standard

point is a inﬁnitesimal(point) in the level, of which the characteristic dimen-

2

sion could compare with the dimension of human being self.

In that level,

people do many practical activities, such as navigation, aviation, spaceﬂight

etc.. The standard point is proper for these practical activities, i.e., the point

in the physical models related to these activities corresponds just to the stan-

dard point. The dimension of standard points is not determined by people at

will, but by the nature of physical laws and the characteristic of the practical

activities. Though we can not show exactly how large a standard point is, the

dimension of standard points is objective. Similarly, every nonstandard point

is a inﬁnitesimal in lower level.

The meaning of “point”, in a word, is not ﬁxed and absolute. By the

concepts of nonstandard analysis, “point” possesses plentiful and vital content.

There is need to make a distinction between diﬀerent points, i.e., the uniform

point and the non-uniform point, the standard point and the nonstandard

point.

(B)Two kinds of diﬀerential equations

Physical laws usually are expressed by diﬀerential equations in mathemat-

ics. Yet the diﬀerential terms in the equations of existent theory are as follows:

∂f
∂t

= lim
△t→0

f (t + △t) − f (t)
△t

,

∂f
∂x

= lim
△x→0

f (x + △x) − f (x)
△x

(1)

Therefore, the limit in mathematics means the fundament of the diﬀerential

equations in existent theory, namely these equations are in the frame of δ − ε.

The limits(△t → 0, △x → 0) in these equations mean that △t and △x tend to

absolute zero in mathematics, while tend to uniform point(uniform particle)

in physics. This fact sets a limit to the nature of the points, to which these

equations are applicable. These equations are available only at uniform points,

3

rather than non-uniform points.

On the other hand, the fundamental equations of turbulence were pre-

sented in the paper [1]. The equations have the same form as those in existent

theory. But the “diﬀerential” terms in the equations of new theory are:

∂f
∂t

=

f (t + εt) − f (t)
εt

,

∂f
∂x

=

f (x + εx) − f (x)
εx

(2)

Here εt and εx are the dimensions of monads and inﬁnitesimal. In nonstandard

analysis, εt and εx are certain numbers(nonstandard numbers). So there is no

limit term in these equations. Obviously, these “diﬀerential equations” are not

based on the limits(△t → 0, △x → 0) and out of the frame of δ − ε. In fact,

a new kind of equations was presented in paper [1]. The new equations diﬀer

essentially from those in existent theory. Here the term in new equations, by

convention, is still written as the diﬀerential in form. But the meaning of this

them is diﬀerent from that of ordinary diﬀerential. New kind of equations can

hold at non-uniform points. Obviously, these new equations have more natural

relation with discretization form of equations than those based on the frame

of δ − ε in numerical computation.

Therefore, there are two kinds of equations: One is the equation in existent

theory. This equation is based on limits(△t → 0, △x → 0)(or so called in

the frame of δ − ε) and available only at uniform points. The other is the

equation in the nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence. The second kind of

equations is out of the frame of δ − ε, and based on the nonstandard analysis.

These new equations can hold at non-uniform points. When motion of ﬂuid

is slow and varies small, the description of the motion by the ﬁrst kind of

equations is suitable. Otherwise, when the motion of ﬂuid is very fast and

4

varies dramatically, e.g.

in the case of turbulence, the reasonable equations

describing the motion are not the ﬁrst kind of equations, but the second kind

of equations.

(C)Nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence and its one case in point

In paper [1], the new concepts of turbulence were presented. The summary

of the new picture of turbulence can be given as follows: A global turbulent

ﬁeld is composed of monad-ﬁelds. The monad-ﬁeld is a ﬁeld in lower level

and can be called as point(standard point) from the angle of the global ﬁeld.

The real turbulent ﬂuctuation stems from the uncertainty of measurement of

turbulence. The average of physical quantities is taken over the point(monad),

namely the point(monad)-average is adopted and computed. The fundamental

equations of turbulence are obtained too. The closure problem is overcome

easily. The closed equations are:

Choice one:

Choice two:

These equations are new kind of equations. The “diﬀerential terms” in the

equations have the form of (2). Therefore, these equations can hold at non-

uniform points(non-uniform monads). The theory mentioned above is called as

the nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence. The meanings of the notation

and letter in the equations (3)-(7) are the same as those in the paper [1].

About this theory, one case in point can be given here.

First, it is necessary to explain whether the Navier-Stokes equations hold

in turbulence. Now this question is presented by following statements: “The

Navier-Stokes equations hold in laminar ﬂows.”, “The Navier-Stokes equations

hold in turbulence too.”, “Do the Navier-Stokes equations hold in turbulence?”

etc.. Obviously, these statements show that when thinking of this question,

people always pay their attention to that a ﬂow is laminar or turbulence.

Usually the Navier-Stokes equations are thought of as available in laminar

ﬂows. And some think that the Navier-Stokes equations hold in turbulence,

others do not.

The Navier-Stokes equations:

∂Ui
∂xi

= 0,

∂Ui
∂t

+

∂UiUj
∂xj

= − 1
ρ

∂P
∂xi

+ ν∇2Ui

(8)

It is well known that the Navier-Stokes equations are based on the limits(△t →

0, △x → 0). Therefore, the Navier-Stokes equations hold only at uniform

points. In laminar ﬂows, not only nonstandard but also standard points are

uniform. So the Navier-Stokes equations hold in laminar ﬂows. However,

in turbulence, nonstandard points are uniform, while standard points are not

uniform and possess interior structure. Hence, in turbulence the Navier-Stokes

equations hold only at nonstandard points, rather than at standard points.

Therefore, the key of the applicability of the Navier-Stokes equations lies in

that the Navier-Stokes equations do not hold at non-uniform points, but only

6

uniform points.

By the analysis above, we know that when numerical computation is taken

for the Navier-Stokes equations, there must be a limit to the grid obtained from

discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. The limit is just that the grid

must be uniform and have no structure through the grid wholly. The direct

numerical simulation(DNS) is generally recognized as a good method of com-

putation for the Navier-Stokes equations now. But the grid of discretization

in DNS is not so small that there is not structure in the grid. It is known that

there still exists structure(so called small vortices) in the discretization-grid

of DNS. Therefore, the method of DNS is not reasonable from the angle of

the Navier-Stokes equations. But the results of the computation in DNS are

very well, why? The reason of this lies in that when DNS is made, people do

not really compute the Navier-Stokes equations, but those in the nonstandard

analysis theory of turbulence(i.e., the equations in Choice one). The results

of DNS are not the values of instantaneous quantities, but average quantities

over the grid. Hence, the success of DNS could be taken for example of the

reasonableness of the nonstandard analysis theory of turbulence.

Abstract

We have preformed experiments on a liquid curtain falling from a horizontal, wetted, tube
and lateraly constrained by two vertical wires. The ﬂuid motion nearly reduces to a free-
fall, with a very low detachment velocity below the tube. Thus, the curtain contains a large
subsonic area, i.e. a domain where the sinuous waves travel faster than the ﬂuid. The upper
boundary not being constrained in the transverse direction, we have observed the appearance
of an up to now unreported instability when the ﬂow rate is progressively reduced: the top
of the curtain enters a pendulum-like motion, coupled to a propagative pattern of curtain
undulations, structured as a chessboard. Measurements of the phase velocity and frequency
of this pattern are reported. Data are in agreement with a simple dimensional argument
suggesting that the wave velocity is proportional to the surface tension divided by the mass
ﬂux of liquid per unit length. This scaling is also that followed by the ﬂuid velocity at the
transonic point, i.e. the point where the ﬂuid velocity equals that of sinuous waves. We ﬁnally
discuss implications of these results on the global stability of falling curtains.

Introduction

Thin liquid sheet ﬂows are involved in numerous practical applications: curtain coating tech-
nics ([Miyamoto & Katagiri (1997)]), atomisation of sheets into droplets ([Lefebvre (1989)]), paper
manufacturing ([Soderberg & Alfredsson (1998)]) ... In this context, plane sheets falling under the
inﬂuence of gravity have been widely studied ([Brown (1961), Lin & Roberts (1981), Lin (1981),
Finnicum, Weistein & Ruschak (1993), de Luca & Costa (1997), Teng, Lin & Chen(1997), de Luca (1999),
Lebon et al. (2003)]). The ﬁrst noticeable contribution was due to Brown ([Brown (1961)]), who
reported the ﬁrst experiments and, among other results, showed that the ﬂow nearly reduces to
a free fall. He also tried to build a stability criterion by considering the possible evolution of
a transient hole through the curtain. Capillary forces tend to increase the hole size, the upper
boundary of which is pulled upward, whereas inertia ”pushes” it downward. This led Brown to
identify the Weber number W e = ρhU 2/2γ built upon surface tension γ, liquid density ρ, local
liquid velocity U and local curtain thickness h, as a key parameter for the stability. Following
his point of view, this number has to be larger than one to guarantee curtain stability. Let us
note however that, as the quantity Γ = hU (ﬂow-rate per unit length) must be conserved while U
increases downward, the Weber number is not uniform, which complicates the possible application
of this criterion.

Further studies mainly focussed on surface waves propagation ([Lin & Roberts (1981), de Luca & Costa (1997)]),

by close analogy with previous works from Taylor on axially expanding sheets ([Taylor (1959)]).
There are several motivations to this interest: (1) modulations of curtains are potential sources of
imperfection in coating techniques; (2) being sensitive to capillary eﬀects they can be used to mea-
sure static or dynamic surface tension ([Lin & Roberts (1981)]); (3) by analogy with atomisation,
decomposition of perturbations upon waves was supposed to give a more natural framework for

1

discussions of curtain stability. One can retain roughly from these studies that two kind of waves
can propagate: a symmetrical mode (varicose waves) corresponding to thickness modulations, and
an anti-symmetrical mode (sinuous mode) corresponding to modulations of the median transverse
position of the curtain ([Taylor (1959)]). These waves have the following velocities (in the limit of
an inviscid ambient gas):

respectively for varicose and sinuous waves (k is the wave number). When the ﬂuid velocity
U exceeds the largest of these two velocities (in practice the sinuous wave velocity, which of-
ten referred to as the most ”dangerous” mode), the perturbations are convected downstream
and the curtain is supposed to be stable. On the other hand, when csin > U , the waves are
able to travel upstream, which suggests that curtain rupture could become possible (provided
than an appropriate ampliﬁcation mechanism can take place). This argument leads exactly
to the same result as that proposed earlier by Brown, as far as the curtain stability is con-
cerned, i.e.
instability when W e < 1 and stability in the opposite case. This argument has
been renewed in terms of absolute and convective instabilities of open ﬂows by several authors
([Lin, Lian & Creighton (1990), Teng, Lin & Chen(1997), de Luca (1999)]), but its relevance is
still subject for debates ([Luchini (2004)]).

The practical application of these ideas to curtain stability turns out to be very diﬃcult. Usu-
ally, W e is not uniform and increases downstream. One has in general a completely stable curtain,
or a situation with an upstream unstable domain and a downstream stable region separated by
what we will call a ”transonic” line ([Brunet, Clanet & Limat (2004)]). The situation is very dif-
ferent from that encountered in atomisation of axially expanding sheets: there is no atomisation
front, and the instability becomes a global problem, very sensitive to boundary conditions. This
is perhaps why the comparison of theories with experiments (patents) is so deceptive: observance
of apparently stable liquid curtains, violating the condition W e > 1 in a large upstream region,
are often mentioned ([Finnicum, Weistein & Ruschak (1993), Lebon et al. (2003)]). Also, all the
calculations recalled above conclude to the fact that W e is the sole relevant number, the viscous
eﬀects, for instance, not being clearly taken into account. On the other hand, years of practice
in the ﬁeld of photographic coating ([Miyamoto & Katagiri (1997)]), all conclude to the fact that,
for gelatine solutions, there is an optimal viscosity close to 30 times that of water for which the
curtain exhibits a maximum of stability. It is to note here that the concept of ”stability” is not
always very clear, as patents mix the problem of curtain rupture and that of curtain depining
from the lateral guides. Nevertheless, it seems that the behaviour of a liquid curtain, including its
stability, can hardly be understood from a general point of view. It is necessary to consider each
geometry separately with a special care taken with boundary conditions.

In the present paper we investigate experimentally a particular case in which, instead of falling
from a slot or from a sharp edge, the liquid is falling from a smoothly curved substrate, in practice
a uniformly wetted horizontal tube. This geometry is encountered in several applied coating
processes, sometimes combined with a rotation of the tube. We do not solve here the complex
related stability problem, but we show that the change of the upper boundary conditions has a
dramatic eﬀect on the curtain behaviour: transverse motions of the upper part of the curtain
become allowed and, when one reduces the ﬂow rate, a speciﬁc instability develops, in which
the curtain exhibits a transition towards an oscillatory pattern of waves. This one, reproduced
in ﬁgure 1, is reminiscent of other propagating patterns encountered in free surface instabilities,
such as hydrothermal waves or the 1D propagating set of waves formed above a immersed hot
wire ([Favre, Blumenfeld & Daviaud (1997)]). We investigate the properties of this up to now
unrecognised pattern, in particular its frequency and phase velocity, varying ﬂow-rate, liquid
properties and tube radius, and we suggest tentative scaling laws for these quantities. A simple

dimensional argument suggests that the phase velocity could be proportional to the critical velocity
found at the ”transonic” line of the curtain, where the liquid velocity is exactly equal to that of
sinuous waves. It seems thus that this instability is linked to intrinsic properties of the curtain
and is not only a consequence of unusual boundary conditions.

Let us mention here that similar observations have been reported very recently in others ge-
ometries: liquid curtain falling across a ﬂat horizontal grid ([Pirat, Maissa & Mathis (2004)]), and
under an overﬂowing circular dish ([Brunet, Clanet & Limat (2004)]), which shows the generality
of this surprising pattern. A brief account of some of our ﬁrst observations is available in coating
congress proceedings ([Lebon et al. (2003)]). Though there is nearly no published report on this
subject, it turns out that this wavy pattern has also been frequently observed in several industrial
coating devices. It constitutes a limit to their eﬃciency, and also can be used as a precursor signal
announcing curtain rupture.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the experimental setup is described. Section
3 presents our observations and data, as well as attempted scaling laws based on dimensional
analysis, before the ﬁnal discussion in section 4.

2 Experimental set-up

The experiment is suggested in ﬁgure 2. The liquid is pumped from a reservoir (1), by means of a
gear-pump ISMATEC BVP-Z (2) which imposes a constant ﬂow-rate Q measured with a ﬂoater
ﬂow-meter (4). A half-ﬁlled chamber (3) damps possible residual perturbations. The liquid is
then injected at the two ends of a horizontal tube (5) (diameter d ranging between 3.4 and 6.8
cm), and ﬂows across a long thin slot (thickness e=2 mm) drilled on the upper tube side. If the
ﬂow-rate is suﬃciently high, a liquid curtain is observed (6). Its width of 25.5 cm is kept constant
along the vertical direction by two thin nylon threads (diameter 0.01 cm), put under tension by
two weights attached at their lower ends. This prevents the curtain shrinkage usually induced by
surface tension. The height of the curtain can be selected at will, ranging between 15 to 25 cm.
All the experiments are performed with silicon oils (Polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS), of diﬀerent
viscosity ranging from 10 to 50 cP. Their physical properties are given in Table 2 . The surface
tension and density are nearly the same for the three oils.
In the following, the three liquids
will be simply referred to as ’V10, ’V30’ or ’V50’. We have checked that the liquid lies at room
temperature, which was maintained between 20◦C and 22◦C during the experiments. Special care
was taken to protect the system from any sources of perturbations, especially air motions around
the experiment.

Curtain undulations are followed by a high-speed video camera (FASTCAM 1024 Motion-

Corder). In practice, a frequency of 250 images per second is found to be enough. Because of
the required short time acquisition, it is specially important to use powerful, and non-pulsed light
sources. The spatial distribution of light had also to be spatially homogeneous. The retained
solution, depicted in ﬁgure 3, uses a 300 Watts incandescent lamp which lights a white screen,
the latter diﬀusing a homogeneous light on the curtain. Another screen, black-coloured, is placed
behind the curtain, to maximise contrast. A circular hole was made in the white screen, through
which the camera lens ﬁts. The reﬂection of this hole induces a parasite round black shadow
on the pictures, of very limited extent, which does not perturb the measurements. The lateral
edges are the nylon wires mentioned above, so that the change of boundary conditions as regards
usual experiments ([Brown (1961), Lin & Roberts (1981), Finnicum, Weistein & Ruschak (1993),
de Luca (1999)]) concerns the connection of the curtain to the injecting cylinder. The position of
the slot has been turned upward in an overﬂowing conﬁguration (see right insert of ﬁgure 2). This
releases the constraint on the curtain transverse position.

3 Properties of the chessboard wave pattern

Experiments are always conducted in the same way: the ﬂow-rate is ﬁrst increased up to around
5 cm2/s to create the curtain. Its lateral boundaries are put in contact with the vertical nylon
wires and then, the ﬂow-rate is progressively decreased. When it reaches a certain threshold, the
chessboard wave pattern is observed. A typical example is reproduced on ﬁgure 1-a. We observe
that the wave velocity (measured horizontally) is nearly independent on z, which leads to the
impression of a uniform translation for each set of left and right waves. Figure 4-a oﬀers a view
from the side and below the injection cylinder, at an orientation of 45◦ with respect to the vertical.
This snaking structure is a clear evidence of the sinuous nature of the waves. Under conditions
for observance of such pattern, the subsonic area is signiﬁcantly extended in the curtain, which
means that the curtain is highly stretched by gravity. It is worthwhile to give here an insight of
the ﬂow in these conditions.

3.1 Description of the ﬂow

0 + 2g

z − α(4ν/ρ)2/3g−1/3

The ﬂow-rate per unit length Γ is simply equal to the total ﬂow-rate Q divided by the curtain
width. Typical values for Γ are ranging between 0.2 cm2/s and 2 cm2/s. By analogy with
the pioneering work of [Brown (1961)], the velocity should be approximately given by: U 2 =
U 2
, α being close to unity. In this range of parameters, U0 is smaller
than 5 cm/s and this term becomes negligible for z larger than a few millimetres. Also, the
oﬀset on z is around 0.3 mm. This was checked by measuring angles of sinuous wakes below an
obstacle ([Lin & Roberts (1981), Roche et al. (2005)]), on the whole curtain. It means that the
initial momentum on top of curtain is weak compared to the momentum due to gravity forces.
The velocity ﬁeld takes the simple expression of a free-fall:

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

The origin z = 0 can be taken at the bottom of the cylinder (ﬁgure 1-a). The length of the
subsonic area is tuned by Γ, as the position z∗ of the vertical coordinate where W e=1 (which is
also the length of the subsonic area), obeys the following condition :

3.2 Results

Measurements of the wave velocity VH = ∆X/∆T , frequency f = 1/∆T , and wavelength λ =
∆X = VH /f are achieved in the following way: grey levels are extracted along a horizontal
line recorded just below the cylinder. By reproducing these grey levels at successive time steps,
one creates a spatio-temporal diagram from which VH , f and λ can be extracted (ﬁgure 4-b).
Measurements extracted from diﬀerent lines z = cte on the curtain did not show any variations,
but the choice to extract just below the curtain provides the best contrast.

Measurements of VH are plotted on ﬁgs. 5-a, versus ﬂow-rate. They concern three viscosities
and two cylinder diameters. It turns out that at ﬁrst order ν and d do not inﬂuence the velocity,
whereas they play a role in the range of existence. A strong increase in the speed is noticeable at
the smallest ﬂow-rates. The quantity γ/(ρΓ) is plotted in dotted line, and it turns out that this
quantity ﬁts very well the VH measurements. Dimensionally, this is the sole speed that can be
built with the physical parameters of the system, which does not depend on z, nor on ν and d.
It is worthwhile to notice that this speed is half the speed of the sinuous waves at the transonic
point (W e=1). Furthermore, taking into account observance of that VH is nearly independent on
z, it can be also found dimensionally by combining the two velocities involved in the problem (csin
given by (2) and U given by (3)). The suitable combination is:

sin
U

(6)

The frequency is plotted versus Γ (ﬁgure 5-b). It increases linearly with ﬂow-rate, with a pre-
factor depending on viscosity and cylinder diameter. Also, several distinct branches of solutions
seem to coexist, which suggests non-trivial non-linear mechanisms. The largest frequencies are
obtained for the less viscous liquid (V10), whereas for higher viscosity (V30, V50) data organise
in others sets of curves at lower f . It is worth noticing that λH was measured independently from
VH and f , and that a relation λH ∼ Γ−2 was found, which is consistent with f ∼ Γ and VH ∼ Γ−1.
This scaling is also consistent with (5), which suggests again the strong relevance of the transonic
line in this problem.

Finally, these plots also contain information on the range of existence of the wave pattern.
which depends both on ν and d in a non-trivial way: a larger d and a larger ν seems to shift the
range to higher ﬂow-rates. For the V50, the range is reduced: this is due to the fact that, when
the ﬂow-rate is decreased further, the curtain can separate into two parallel curtains, localised
symmetrically to the median plane (yOz), or is replaced by a thinner curtain coexisting with an
array of columns. For this reason too, it was not possible to observe any wave pattern with the
largest diameter d=6.8 cm. For high viscosities, the curtain existence range is reduced because
of such a separation. This destabilising eﬀect of viscosity may remind the Kapitza instability
([Kapitza (1948)]) of a viscous layer of liquid ﬂowing on an inclined plate: destabilising eﬀects due

[Chang(1994)]).

4 Discussion - Conclusions

This study reports a new curtain instability leading to a striking pattern of propagative waves. This
pattern is presumably due to the pendulum-like oscillations, allowed by the free-constrained bound-
ary conditions on top of the curtain. This may remind some observations on liquid bells formed be-
low an overﬂowing dish or a porous ring ([Brunet, Clanet & Limat (2004), Pirat, Maissa & Mathis (2004)]).

Even if the hydrodynamic mechanisms for velocity and frequency selections still remain unclear,

the measurements provide several clues:

- The wave velocity seems to be related to the properties of the transonic line (z = z∗): ﬁrst,
its absolute value is half the ﬂow-speed (and so half the sinuous wave-speed) at z∗, and is exactly
the same on the whole curtain. This is a strong proof for a selection mechanism which involves
the transonic point. This quantity also does not depend on ν nor d.

- The frequency follows a linear relationship with ﬂow-rate. However the pre-factor depends
on ν, d and presumably on other parameters which inﬂuence the complex free-surface shape just
below the overhang.

Our observations also question the nature of this pattern in the framework of convective/absolute
instabilities in weakly non-parallel ﬂows. Usually ([Monkewitz, Huerre & Chomaz (1993)]), a
global mode is predicted when the length of the region of absolute instability (here the region
W e <1) is larger than a certain threshold, which can happen when the ﬂow-rate is decreased.
The spatial homogeneity of the pattern as well as the velocity selection suggest that it may be
identiﬁed to such a global mode.

Furthermore, some points of our study could be related to the still disputed problem of curtain
break-up. First, it shows that sinuous waves, generally pointed out to cause curtain break-up,
can be withstood at relatively high amplitudes without leading to break-up. More generally from
our observations, no evidence supports the scenario of break-up from a global mode induced by
growth of waves, contrary to recent suggestions ([de Luca (1999), Lin & Jiang (2003)]). Also,
contrary to the case of a cylindrical jet submitted to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability (where such
a break-up scenario is indisputable), surface tension does not promote instability in a liquid sheet,
but rather damps it ([Li & Tankin (1991)]) (even if it increases the velocity of sinuous waves).

Figure 6: An about micron-thick curtain obtained with a bottom boundary condition constrained
by a horizontal tube attached to the guides. One can notice several rainbow patterns (Γ = 0.015
cm2/s. V30 oil).

Then in the presumably unstable part of the curtain where W e <1(if one trusts into a break-up
scenario based on wave ampliﬁcation), stabilising surface tension eﬀects should dominate inertia
and prevent any break-up. This is perhaps related to the discrepancy between linear theories
and experimental situations where an entirely subsonic curtain can be observed without break-up
([Finnicum, Weistein & Ruschak (1993), Lebon et al. (2003)]). In every careful experiment that
we carried out, break-up was always due to the growth of a hole invading the curtain, and never
by ampliﬁcation of curtain undulations. This is consistent with a recent paper [Luchini (2004)].
In that sense, a globally subsonic liquid curtain can be considered as a ’metastable’ object, as it
withstands weak perturbations and is broken by stronger ones ([Roche et al. (2005)]).

This study ﬁnally illustrates the inﬂuence of the modiﬁcation of the upper boundary condi-
tions on the dynamics and stability of a falling curtain. Qualitatively, we have also begun to
investigate the inﬂuence of the bottom boundary condition. A striking result is observed: one
can maintain curtains at very low ﬂow-rates by simply adding a cylinder at the bottom of the
curtain ([Lebon et al. (2003)]). In this situation, hole nucleation at the curtain bottom becomes
very diﬃcult, which prevents break-up. Such a situation is shown in ﬁgure 6, where rainbow
patterns witness the sheet thickness can be locally of the order of a few light wavelengths. Local
perturbations on such thin curtains (brought by an obstacle, for example) do not necessary lead
to break-up. This surprising eﬀect is presently under study.

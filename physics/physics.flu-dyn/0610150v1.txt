Abstract

A Particle Tracking Velocimetry experiment has been performed in a turbulent ﬂow at interme-

diate Reynolds number. We present experimentally obtained stretching rates for particle pairs in

the inertial range. When compensated by a characteristic time scale for coarse-grained strain we

observe constant stretching. This indicates that the process of material line stretching taking place

in the viscous subrange has its counterpart in the inertial subrange. We investigate both forwards

and backwards dispersion. We ﬁnd a faster backwards stretching and relate it to the problem of

relative dispersion and its time asymmetry.

INTRODUCTION

The time asymmetry existing in a turbulent ﬂow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation

has recently been discussed in the connection with the diﬀusion properties of two nearby

ﬂuid particles initially close to each other. A stochastic model study by Sawford et al. [18]

showed that backwards dispersion is faster than the corresponding forwards dispersion. This

has practical implications for a variety of applications dealing with transport and mixing in

turbulent ﬂows.

The asymmetry was experimentally veriﬁed by a Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV)

experiment by Berg et al. [1] who speculated that kinematic inﬁnitesimal material line

stretching has its counter-part in the inertial range. Diﬀerent stretching rates could then

explain the observed diﬀerence in forwards and backwards dispersion. Through a ﬁnite

Reynolds number formulation of the much celebrated Richardson law

= gεt3 it was

r2

i

found that following two particles backwards in time the dispersion was faster by a factor of

approximately two compared with following the particles forwards in time. This ratio was

also obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) analysis by the same authors (data

originally presented in [2, 4]). Sawford et al. [18] found the same ratio to be much larger:

between 5 and 20.

Yet another stochastic model was developed by L¨uthi et al. [10]. By assuming that

stretching rates behave self-similar results consistent with [1] were obtained. By self-similar

stretching we think of particle separation which is similar on the diﬀerent scales. The self-

similarity of stretching rates has, however, not been shown.

In this paper we will explore forwards/backwards dispersion in the context of coarse-

grained strain dynamics. The latter has recently got a lot of attention in the turbulence

community since it is more or less related to Large Eddy Simulations (LES) [5, 7, 10, 13,

17, 19, 20]. One can expect Kolmogorov similarity scaling to hold for the coarse-grained

quantities as long as the ﬁltering scale is less than the integral scale in the ﬂow where the

turbulence is solely represented by the kinetic energy dissipation of the ﬂow, ε

As in [10] we deﬁne the coarse-grained velocity gradient tensor to be

Here B∆/2 denotes a Ball with radius ∆/2 and V its volume.

We will follow the lines of [1] and L¨uthi et al. [10] and present experimental evidence of

self-similar stretching in a turbulent ﬂow of intermediate Reynolds number. The result is

linked to particle pair separation and is able to account for the diﬀerence in forwards and

backwards dispersion.

II. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

We have performed a Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) experiment in an intermediate

Reynolds number turbulent ﬂow. The ﬂow has earlier been reported in [1]. PTV is an

experimental method suitable for obtaining Lagrangian statistics in turbulent ﬂows [6, 11,

12, 14, 16, 22]: Lagrangian trajectories of ﬂuid particles in water are obtained by tracking

neutrally buoyant particles in space and time. The ﬂow is generated by eight rotating

propellers, which change their rotational direction in ﬁxed intervals in order to suppress a

mean ﬂow, placed in the corners of a tank with dimensions 32

32

50cm3 (see Fig 1). The

×

×

data acquisition system consists of four commercial CCD cameras with a maximum frame

rate of 50Hz at 1000

1000 pixels. The measuring volume covers roughly (12cm)3. We use

polystyrene particles with size

400µm and density very close to one. We follow

(1000)

particles at each time step with a position accuracy of 0.05 pixels corresponding to less than

lamp.

The Stokes number, τI/τη (τI denotes the inertial relaxation time for the particle to the

ﬂow while τη is the Kolmogorov time) is much less than one and the particles can therefore

be treated as passive tracers in the ﬂow. The particles are illuminated by a 250W ﬂash

The mathematical algorithms for translating two dimensional image coordinates from the

four camera chips into a full set of three dimensional trajectories in time involve several cru-

cial steps: ﬁtting gaussian proﬁles to the 2d images, stereo matching (line of sight crossings)

with a two media (water-air) optical model and construction of 3d trajectories in time by

using the kinematic principle of minimum change in acceleration [15, 21].

proximation of eqn. 2 of the coarse-grained quantities. Using this many particles has the

drawback that we can not study the dynamics at the smallest scales. In Figure 2 (a) the

radial distribution of particles is shown. The probability Np(r) of ﬁnding a given number

N of particles on the surface of a ball centered in our measuring volume with radius r is

observed to increase with r2 up to

200η. This means that the particle density can be

∼

considered uniform up to this scale. For lager radius the density drops down because of non-

perfect illumination at the boundary of the measuring volume. The cumulative distribution

is show in (b) and is interesting because it gives us an estimate of the number of particles

we can expect to ﬁnd in a ball with radius r. The number is, however, only an upper bound

since the ball is centered in the measuring volume and not around all individual particles in

the ﬂow.

As already reported in [1, 10] the mean ﬂow is slightly straining though with a charac-

teristic time scale many times larger than the integral time scale of the ﬂow. An alternative

way of emphasizing the large scale mean strain is shown in Figure 3. cos2(xi,

λ1), where xi

is the three coordinate axes, is observed to peak for large r in the vertical direction while

e

the horizontal axes decrease in agreement with an axis-symmetric ﬂow. A slow convergence

towards isotropy is observed as r = ∆ is reduced.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have given evidence of the existence of, what we call self-similar stretching rates:

when scaled by a relevant time t⋆ scale which is a function of the second order structure

function stretching rates of inﬁnitesimal material lines has its counterpart in the inertial

range. Furthermore it turns out that this relevant time scale t⋆ is related to the coarse-

grained strain ﬁeld. The stretching is like in the viscous range far from being perfectly

aligned with the most positive direction of strain which we have shown would lower the

ratio between forwards and backwards dispersion.

Whether or not the Lagrangian stretching rates found in this paper are universal or

speciﬁc for this particular turbulent ﬂow other experiments and/or DNS will have to decide.

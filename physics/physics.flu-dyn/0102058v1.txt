Abstract

We evaluate numerically the velocity ﬁeld distributions produced by a
bounded, two-dimensional ﬂuid model consisting of a collection of parallel
ideal line vortices. We sample at many spatial points inside a rigid circular
boundary. We focus on “nearest neighbor” contributions that result from
vortices that fall (randomly) very close to the spatial points where the veloc-
ity is being sampled. We conﬁrm that these events lead to a non-Gaussian
high-velocity “tail” on an otherwise Gaussian distribution function for the
Eulerian velocity ﬁeld. We also investigate the behavior of distributions that
do not have equilibrium mean-ﬁeld probability distributions that are uniform
inside the circle, but instead correspond to both higher and lower mean-ﬁeld
energies than those associated with the uniform vorticity distribution. We
ﬁnd substantial diﬀerences between these and the uniform case.

I. INTRODUCTION

Study of the hydrodynamics of ideal line vortices goes back at least as far as Helmholtz in
the 19th century, and was developed in the 20th by Lin [1] and Onsager [2], who ﬁrst made
the dynamical system an object of statistical mechanical inquiry. The system appeared in
plasma physics when Taylor and McNamara [3,4] calculated the Bohm-like coeﬃcients of
self-diﬀusion for a strongly-magnetized, two-dimensional, electrostatic guiding-center plasma
model, a system whose mathematical description becomes identical with that of the ideal line
vortex system under appropriate substitutions; the fact that these diﬀusion coeﬃcients were
inversely proportional to the ﬁrst power of the magnetic ﬁeld, even in thermal equilibrium,
was startling.

The system is one for which interesting statistical-mechanical and ﬂuid-mechanical ques-
tions can be asked, but must be asked with care, for two reasons. First, viscous eﬀects have
never been fully included in the model, although some forms of Navier-Stokesian behavior
have on occasion been observed for it. Secondly, no classical, extensive “thermodynamic
limit” exists for the system in the conventional sense, and the partition function, even for
the case in which there is no overall net vorticity, does not in general exist in the inﬁnite
volume limit [5]. None of the standard machinery of equilibrium statistical mechanics can
be trusted completely without re-examination.

One question that can be asked, motivated in part by various probability distribution
function measurements for turbulent ﬂuid velocities that have been made in recent years,
concerns the distribution of the velocity ﬁeld at a ﬁxed point in space, one at which no vortex
necessarily resides. The ﬁeld in question is one that is produced by all the vortices. This is a
close analogue of the question of the probability distribution of the vector gravitational ﬁeld
due to a large collection of point masses, a question addressed in detail by Chandrasekhar
in 1943 [6]. Under the assumption that the point masses in three dimensions are uniformly
distributed and uncorrelated, the resulting Holtsmark distribution has many non-standard
properties, including the divergence of some of its low-order moments: a consequence of the
long range of the inverse-square force ﬁeld and the fact that point masses (or charges) each
have an inﬁnite “self energy” that reﬂects itself in the total force ﬁeld when the single-particle
contributions are combined additively.

In a recent interesting paper [7], Kuvshinov and Schep considered the statistics of the
velocity ﬁeld of a large but ﬁnite number of ideal line vortices inside a circular boundary
(see also the paper of Chukbar [8], which is of some importance). They assumed uniformly
distributed and uncorrelated line vortices of a single sign of vorticity. They noted that
the Holtsmark-style treatment carried out by Chandrasekhar for the three-dimensional case
contained a divergent integral in two dimensions, and so was not immediately applicable.
They then performed repeated numerical measurements of the two-dimensional (2D) velocity
ﬁeld, near the center of the circular boundary, that resulted from uncorrelated random
distributions of large numbers of vortices, thrown at each trial into the circular boundary
without correlation and without any mean density variation.

The most interesting result of Kuvshinov and Schep was thus an “experimentally” de-
termined probability distribution for the velocity which seemed to split naturally into two
parts: a Gaussian distribution for the lower velocities and high-energy “tails” for the larger
velocities that fell oﬀ approximately as the third power of the ﬂuctuating velocity. (Here,

2

“ﬂuctuating” velocities are interpreted to mean those with the mean-ﬁeld rigid rotation as-
sociated with the uniform vorticity density distribution subtracted out.) They hypothesized
that the approximate inverse third-power dependence of the tail was a consequence of occa-
sional “near neighbor” contributions, in which one vortex found itself very close to the point
where the velocity ﬁeld was being sampled, and generalized a three-dimensional “nearest-
neighbor” algebraic argument of Chandrasekhar’s [6] to account for this high-velocity power
law contribution. In a rather diﬀerent continuum model, something not totally dissimilar
had previously been reported by Jimenez [9].

We have in this paper repeated certain features of Kuvshinov and Schep’s numerical
experiment, and have attempted to modify and amplify it in a variety of ways. (1) We have
inserted an ideal, perfectly-reﬂecting wall boundary at the radius of the conﬁning circle by
changing the Green’s function to one that, by the method of images, guarantees the vanishing
of all radial velocities at the boundary [10], rather than using the inverse logarithmic Green’s
function appropriate to the unbounded region. (2) We have, upon ﬁnding the non-Gaussian
high-velocity tails in the probability distribution function, implemented a program that
searches numerically for near neighbor contributions to the locally measured velocity ﬁeld,
and when it ﬁnds one, deletes its contribution to the local velocity ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that as
a consequence, the high-velocity tails disappear, thus reinforcing the conjecture of Ref. [7].
(3) We study the velocity ﬁeld away from the origin, to determine how representative of the
entire spatial volume the velocity ﬁeld sampled at the center is. (4) Finally, we allow the
mean vorticity density with which the vortex particles are distributed to vary, and rather
than placing them randomly with a spatially-uniform mean-ﬁeld distribution, we weight their
locations with a probability distribution function that depends exponentially upon a mean-
ﬁeld stream function and has a temperature that can be positive or negative [10,11]. The
equilibrium statistical mechanics of the ideal line vortex system has undergone considerable
development since it was introduced (e.g., [10–13], and references therein) and we take
advantage of results which we will not go into full detail describing here. We note only that
the pairwise, additive Coulomb potentials, summed over all the pairs in the system, are an
ideal invariant dynamically which can take on virtually any value and which determines the
single-time thermal-equilibrium probability distributions of all particles. Only one value of
this energy is represented by the uniform distribution. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
velocity ﬁeld statistics that result from total mean energies that are signiﬁcantly higher or
lower than those associated with the unﬁorm (rigidly-rotating) mean-ﬁeld distribution.

In Sec. II, we describe the comptutational procedure and the results for the uniform
mean-ﬁeld vorticity density distribution for points near the center of the circle, with an
emphasis on non-Gaussian, high-velocity “tails” that appear in the probability distribution
function for the velocity. In Sec. III, we introduce a cutoﬀ below which “near neighbor”
contributions to the velocity ﬁeld are locally removed, and derive an analytic expression
for the contribution of very near neighbors to the local velocity ﬁeld distribution. Sec.
IV discusses the statistics of the velocity ﬁeld for the uniform density distribution away
from the center of the container and near the boundary. Sec. V is devoted to the case in
which the mean number density of vortices is not uniform, but rather follows from a self-
consistent, mean-ﬁeld theory which permits the study of high and low energy states, relative
to the uniform density state. Sec. VI presents the results for the non-uniform mean-ﬁeld
distributions. Sec. VII summarizes the results and indicates possible future directions for

3

further investigations.

II. GENERAL PROCEDURE

In a point vortex model, where each vortex has strength κj the ﬂow is two-dimensional

in the (x, y) plane, has only x and y components, and is given by

v(r) =

κj∇ × (G(r, rj)ez)

Xj

(2.1)

Here ez is the unit vector pointing perpendicular to the plane of the spatial variation of the
ﬂuid, G is the Green’s function that relates the vorticity to the stream function, and the
sum is over all (two-dimensional) vortex positions rj. Thus, we see that the velocity at a
given point is due to all the vortices not at that point. For a two-dimensional ﬂuid, in a
rigid, circular container of radius R, the boundary condition is that the normal component
of v go to zero at the wall. The appropriate Green’s function to choose is [10]

Where vr and vθ represent the r and θ components of velocity due to one point vortex of
strength κ, and θ12 is the angle between the radii to the point where the velocity is measured
and the position of the vortex. For each component the terms with R represent the terms
that are a result of the ﬁnite boundary.

All quantities will be expressed throughout in terms of dimensionless variables appro-
priate to the model. Since the Euler dynamics contain no viscosity, all quantities in the
dynamics before non-dimensionalization contain only combinations of lengths and times, or
equivalently, velocities and times, so units are not of great signiﬁcance. For a convenient
basic unit of length, we may take the mean nearest-neighbor separation in a uniform vortic-
ity benchmark case divided by π1/2 and for the basic unit of velocity, the speed with which
an isolated vortex of strength 2π will rotate the ﬂuid in which it is imbedded at unit length
distance from the vortex.

The general procedure we use is to place a large number, N, of vortices of strength
κ = 2π into a circular region of radius R using a random number generator and study the
statistics of the resulting velocity ﬁeld. Speciﬁcally, we examine the probability distribution
for the scalar ﬂuctuating velocity |w| = w, where w = v − V, and V is the mean-ﬁeld
velocity. Let f (w)dw be the probability that the velocity is in the area element (in velocity
space) dw centered at w. We are here assuming that the distribution is isotropic in velocity

4

space, which is conﬁrmed by our numerics everywhere except in a very thin layer near
the radial boundary. We wish to switch to a one-dimensional integral, which is done by
letting F (w)dw = 2πwf (w)dw. The resulting distribution F (w) is normalized such that
∞
o F (w)dw = 1. Our graphs contain a numerically obtained F (w). The procedure for
R
obtaining this F is to ﬁrst run a series of trials, each trial representing a set of random
choices for the vortex positions inside the circle. For the uniform vorticity density case,
we have run 3000 trials. Then, we record a velocity value at each point sampled in the
circle. Here we have sampled at 50 points separated by uniform intervals from r = 0 to
r = 399, where R = 400 and N = 1.6 × 105. We then bin the velocities using a histogram
with uniform spacing between bins. This procedure gives us an unnormalized probability
distribution for f . To get from this step to the actual F plotted requires two steps: (1) We
ﬁrst multiply each bin value by the w at the center of its bin. (2) We normalize the result
F (w)dw = 1. It is easiest
using a trapezoidal numerical integration, so that, numerically
to see the probability distribution’s behavior on a natural log plot, so we plot ln(F (w)/w)
versus w2. The error bars are one standard deviation of the mean in length above and below;
namely, we calculate the standard deviation of ln(F/w) and then divide by the square root
of the number of actual events that fall into that histogram bin. We present two graphs
for each point sampled in the uniform case: (1) A graph that includes all numerical events.
(2) A graph with the “nearest-neighbor” events subtracted out. The subtraction procedure
is deﬁned relatively simply and somewhat arbitrarily. At each point sampled, the program
records the distance to all of the vortices placed in the region. If the distance d is such that
d < 0.65 then that event is deleted from the distribution for that point only. That is, if
there is a nearest neighbor event recorded at r = 200 for example, its removal will not aﬀect
the resulting distribution at any other point. The resulting distribution can be thought of
as the probability distribution if there were never any “nearest-neighbor” events. In each
plot, the solid line is a best-ﬁt Gaussian given by [7]:

III. NEAREST NEIGHBORS

Here we follow the general procedure of Chandrasekhar [6], but carry it out in two
dimensions and for a general mean-ﬁeld vorticity density n(r) to get an analytical expression
for nearest neighbor events. Let Fn(r′)dr′ represent the probability that that the nearest
neighbor lies between r′ and r′ + dr′. This probability must be equal to the probability that
no neighbors are interior to r′ times the probability that a particles does exist in the circular
shell between r′ and r′ + dr′. Thus Fn(r′) must satisfy [6]

IV. RESULTS FOR UNIFORM VORTICITY DENSITY CASE

Figs. 1 and 2 display results for the numerically determined velocity distribution for the
uniform mean-ﬁeld vorticity density runs, a total of 3000 trials. Fig. 1 shows results of
sampling at r = 0, and Fig. 2 at r = 399, quite close to the wall. At intermediate points,
the results are quite similar to those at r = 0.

In Figs. 1a and 1b, the solid line represents the Gaussian, Eq. (2.4), with the same mean-
square velocity ﬂuctuation. The dashed line represents the nearest neighbor contribution,
as predicted by Eq. (3.5). The “experimentally” determined points are shown with their
associated error bars, estimated as described in Sec. II. Fig. 1a shows the results for the
raw data, with no “nearest neighbor” events removed. Fig. 1b (the lower ﬁgure) shows the
results of deleting the nearest neighbor events. The reason no data points appear above
w2 of about 85 is that all the computed points above that value contain nearest neighbor
events. A similar set of statements applies to Figs. 2a,b, which are for the radius r = 399.
In both cases, it appears that the high-velocity events are reasonably well predicted by Eq.
(3.5). In both cases, the Gaussian (2.4) is clearly a good approximation only for the lower
values of w.

Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the numerically-obtained magnitude of the radial com-
ponent of velocity as a function of r. The intent is to assess the eﬀect of the rigid boundary
at r = 400, the location of the wall. It will be seen that the decrease of the radial velocities
is signiﬁcant only within a relatively thin boundary layer near the wall. If the vortex dy-
namics were allowed to evolve in time, it is expected that the boundary layer would persist,

6

but might acquire dimensions not necessarily the same as observed for the purely random
distribution.

Summarizing, we conclude that for the case in which the uniform mean-ﬁeld vorticity
density applies, there are indeed non-Gaussian tails present in the probability distributions,
and we conﬁrm the conjecture of Kuvshinov and Schep that they may be explained as the
result of nearest-neighbor contributions. Only near the radial boundary does its presence
result in any signiﬁcant departure from the statistics observed in the interior, for this case.

V. NON-UNIFORM MEAN-FIELD VORTICITIES: “MOST PROBABLE”
DISTRIBUTIONS

Up to this point, we have considered only the case of the uniform probability distribution
for vortices. However, a much wider variety of thermal equilibrium states is possible for ideal
line vortices, considered as a dynamical system ( [2,4,5,10–16], and references therein). The
Hamiltonian or energy of the system is equivalent to the Coulomb energies of the pairs of
interacting line vortices, summed over all the pairs, and is a constant of the motion for
these boundary conditions. More extensive investigations have been carried out for the
two-species case than for the present one-species case, but one species may equally well be
considered. The preceding results do not apply to any value of the energy expectation (which
is determined by the initial conditions chosen when the system is considered dynamically)
except the one associated with the completely uniform mean-ﬁeld distribution. For either
higher or lower energies, the thermal equilibrium, mean-ﬁeld, one-body distribution is not
spatially uniform. It is concentrated toward r = 0 for higher energies, and around the rim
for lower ones. In this Section, we provide an expression for the probability distribution for
these higher and lower energy cases, referring to the rather extensive cited literature for the
formalism and justiﬁcation ( [10–16], and references therein).

We ﬁnd the mean ﬁelds from solving the one-species analogue of the “sinh-Poisson”

equation,

∇2ψ = −ω = −e−α−βψ

(5.1)

where ψ is the “most probable” stream function, and ω is its associated mean-ﬁeld vorticity
distribution. In the present case, it will be assumed that the relevant solutions are symmetric
with respect to rotations about r = 0.

Eq. (5.1) is to be solved subject to the constrainst that E = 1
(∇ψ)2d2x and Ω =
2
∇2ψd2x, where E is the mean-ﬁeld energy, and Ω is the total vorticity. If we assume ψ
dr = −ω = −e−α−βψ, which is

is a function of radius only, Eq. (5.1) becomes simply 1

and ω = Ω
(1+c2r2)2 , where c2 is given by Eq. (5.4). We have now expressed the mean-ﬁeld

vorticity directly in terms of energy and vorticity.
It follows that when placing vortices
“randomly” into the circular region for numerical trials, we should weight their placements
by a probability distribution that wil lead to the correct ω in the mean-ﬁeld limit. That is,

p(r, θ)rdr =

r

get E0 = Ω2/8π. The nearest neighbor formula must be modiﬁed to

VI. RESULTS FOR NON-UNIFORM TRIALS

As might be expected, noticeable diﬀerences occur when the mean-ﬁeld vorticity is a
function of radius. First, the mean azimuthal velocity no longer corresponds to a rigid
rotation, and the ﬂuctuating velocity must be referred to it locally. Qualitatively, it might
be expected that the higher energy trials will produce more nearest-neighbor events, at
constant mean density over the whole circle, and hence a more intense velocity ﬂuctuation
spectrum, and the opposite for the lower energy cases. That seems to be what happens.

We conducted two runs of 1790 trials each, with N = 1.6 × 105 and R = 400, as before.
One of the sets of trials corresponded to mean-ﬁeld energy E = 4E0 and the other set to
E = E0/4. Fig. 4 shows the mean probability distribution, Eq. (5.5), evaluated for the two
cases. Consistently with Ampere’s law and the remarks above, more (less) vorticity must
be crowded toward the origin for the higher (lower) energies. We should bear in mind that
associated with each individual line vortex, there is an inﬁnite positive self-energy. This is not
included in what we are calling the “mean-ﬁeld energy,” which is a sum of potential energies
between pairs only. Nevertheless, choosing mean-ﬁeld energies above that of the uniform
distribution greatly enchances the ability of a given number of line vortices to strengthen the
high-velocity tails: crowding the vortices together produces more opportunities for nearest

8

neighbor events in the regions of enhanced mean-ﬁeld vorticity. Also, where there is a
high probability density, we may expect a large value of the average velocity that is not
attributable to nearest neighbor events.

Fig. 5 displays the vorticity probability distribution at r = 40.7 for the E = 4E0 case;
this is inside the region of high radial probability density. Note the very large value of w
and the associated large values of w2. The probability of ﬁnding a vortex near this point
is so high, in fact, that every single trial contained at least one nearest-neighbor event,
so the corresponding graph with nearest neighbor events deleted has no data points in it,
according to our previously-chosen criterion. We also observe that the nearest-neighbor
formula (broken line) and the Gaussian (solid line) are not far apart for this case.

Figs. 6a,b are also for the high-energy case, but sample the velocity ﬁeld at r = 114, an
intermediate value. Here we observe, as in the uniform vorticity density case, a noticeable
high-velocity tail attributable to the nearest-neighbor events which disappears when those
events are deleted. The much lower value of w = 3.3 is close to what was seen in the uniform
vorticity case, and far lower than in Figs. 5a,b. Not only the mean-ﬁelds, but the statistics
of the ﬂuctuations, are now strongly position-dependent. This point is made even more
strongly by looking at the velocity distribution at r = 399, near the wall (Figs. 7a,b). Here,
where the probability distribution is very low, there is little velocity ﬂuctuation (w = 0.35).
Here, the nearest-neighbor calculation is of severely limited applicability. The Gaussian is
still present, as is the high-velocity tail, but the high-velocity tail does not disappear when
the nearest neighbor events are deleted. The nearest neighbor formula derivation takes no
account of the proximity of the wall, eﬀectively assuming a rotational symmetry about the
point of observation which is not even approximately fulﬁlled near the wall. The boundary
condition begins to make itself strongly felt in this case, and it is not obvious how to include
it in any theory.

Turning now to the second set of trials, with E = E0/4, we consider the case where the
probability is concentrated near the walls. We present the results of sampling at the radius
r = 147 (Figs. 8a,b). This is again an intermediate regime where the results are not greatly
diﬀerent from the uniform mean-vorticity case. Closer to the wall, the locally larger values
of p again diminish the diﬀerences between this case and the uniform ω case.

In summary, there are some strong qualitative similarities between the uniform and non-
uniform mean ﬁeld vorticity cases: the division into Gaussian plus high-velocity tail is usually
applicable. One principal quantitative diﬀerence is that the ﬂuctuation level becomes more
intense for the high-energy cases in those regions where the vorticity is concentrated. The
mean velocity can also go up, and the mean ﬁeld also becomes more intense. The overall
ﬂuctuation level goes up dramatically with mean-ﬁeld energy. Though we do not have a
theory for how fast it should go up, we can see from Fig. 9 that it is considerably faster than
linear. Fig. 9 shows the mean ﬁeld energy, normalized to the uniform mean-vorticity values,
as a function of mean-ﬁeld energy, for the three values of mean-ﬁeld energy considered.
Adding points to this graph is an expensive and time-consuming activity, but would seem
to be a worthwhile undertaking. The signiﬁcantly noisier high-energy states for the system
is something that will be characteristic of the ideal line vortex model but not for continuum
models of a ﬂuid.

VII. CLOSING REMARKS

We have investigated numerically the statistics of the Eulerian velocity ﬁeld in two di-
mensional ﬂows generated by a large number of ideal, parallel, line vortices inside an axisym-
metric rigid boundary. This is a dynamical system the statistical mechanics of which have
been interesting to investigate in their own right, and which also seem to have implications,
not fully elucidated, for two-dimensional viscous continuum ﬂows [14–16]. By considering
the numerical eﬀects of “near neighbors” and their contributions to the velocity ﬁelds at
ﬁxed spatial points, we have to a considerable degree conﬁrmed the hypothesis of Kuvshi-
nov and Schep [7] that the observed non-Gaussian, approximately third power “tails” in the
velocity ﬁeld distribution are due to these near neighbor events. These tails coexist with a
“bulk” Gaussian distribution at lower velocities.

The phenomenon of non-Gaussian high-velocity tails in measurement and computation
of three-dimensional continuum ﬂuid turbulence has been observed before (e.g., Vincent
and Meneguzzi [18]; see also Jimenez [9]). In computations, also simultaneously visible have
been concentrated vortex conﬁgurations that have variously been called “tubes,” “worms”
or “spaghetti,” since they are longer by a considerable amont in one dimension than they are
in the other two. Accounting for these conﬁgurations has been an important problem. It is
diﬃcult not to imagine that the one might be responsible for the other. That is, we suggest
that the non-Gaussian tails are a signature of physically proximate strong, tubular vortices
which are enough like “line” vortices that they account for the tails in three dimensions in
the manner observed here in pure two-dimensional form.

A second part of the investigation has been motivated by the recognition that pairwise
interaction energies, summed over all the pairs of an assembly of identical line vortices,
provides a ﬁnite integral of the motion that can be set at any value, and determines as
much about the thermal equilibria that are possible as energy usually does for conservative
statistical-mechanical systems. The non-uniform mean-ﬁeld distribution which results can
impact the microscopic ﬂuctuation distribution for a ﬁxed number of vortices by creating
more (and therefore noisier) regions where “near neighbors” reside. Such an eﬀect will
undoubtedly enhance transport properties, such as the coeﬃcient of self diﬀusion [3,4],
because of the larger random velocities which result.

It would be of interest to follow up these investigations with dynamical computations,
in which an assembly of line vortices was moved around by its self-consistent velocity ﬁeld,
with an eye toward measuring two-time statistical correlations of Eulerian velocity ﬁelds,
diﬀusion and decay rates. Measured coeﬃcients of self-diﬀusion may be determined numer-
ically, and may be found to depend fundamentally on the mean-ﬁeld energy and consequent
temperature that characterize a vortex equilibrium and not to be representable by any “uni-
versal” formula. Much earlier computations and theories for ideal line vortex dynamics [9–11]
showed unexpected late implications for Navier-Stokes ﬂuid turbulence in two dimensions
[14,15]. Standard “homogeneous turbulence” theories were shown to be very poor predictors
for the late-time states of turbulent ﬂuids in two dimensions, once this step was taken. We
may speculate that the present considerations, which extend Holtsmark statistics beyond the
spatially uniform case, might substantially revise, for example, the magnitudes of transport
coeﬃcients that are often assigned to such diverse systems as galaxies or globular clusters
[6] and dilute magnetized plasmas [3,4].

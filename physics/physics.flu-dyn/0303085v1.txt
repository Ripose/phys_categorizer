From a columnar approximation of the Euler equations of an incompressible ﬂuid with surface
tension, we derive in the short-wave approximation a new integrable classical 1+1 dimensional ﬁeld
theory for the motion of the surface. Together with a Lorentz invariance, this system has the novel
feature of solutions which become multiple valued in ﬁnite time.

Introduction. The nonlinear and dispersive propaga-
tion of surface waves in an ideal incompressible ﬂuid
(depth h, density σ), under the action of gravity g and
surface tension T , is a classical subject of investigation
in mathematical physics [1, 2, 3]. In this letter we derive
and study a new integrable model equation from asymp-
totic dynamics of a short capillary-gravity wave, namely

Here u(x, t) is the ﬂuid velocity on the surface, x and t are
space and time variables, subindices mean partial deriva-
tives, θ = (T /σh2g) is the dimensionless Bond number
and v = (3T /σh)1/2.

The dynamics of surface waves in an ideal ﬂuid obeys
complicated nonlinear and dispersive equations. To sim-
plify them, multiscale asymptotic methods can be em-
ployed. Most of the resultant asymptotic models rep-
resent, for large t, balance between weak nonlinearities
and linear dispersion. For instance the long-wave dy-
namics of a low amplitude initial proﬁle on a shallow
dispersive ﬂuid are well known nowadays. The models
extend from the oldest Boussinesq systems or the ubiq-
uitous Korteweg-deVries [3] to the more recent Camassa-
Holm equation [4] with nonlinear dispersion. In contrast,
hardly anything is known about asymptotic models for
nonlinear and dispersive dynamics of short-waves. For
the most part short waves have been studied in connec-
tion with modulation of short-wave trains [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
In this paper we derive the model (1) in the short-wave
regime of surface waves, we prove that it is integrable
and show that it leads to unusual special solutions that
develop singular behavior in ﬁnite time.

The short-wave limit. To deﬁne a short wave (wave
length l, wave number k = 2π/l) one needs to compare
l to an underlying space scale. We use the unperturbed
depth h as the natural reference, and thus consider h =

kh =

(1/ǫ),

O

(2)

where ǫ is the parameter of the asymtotic expansions.

Multiscale asymptotic methods are strongly based on
the dispersion relation ω(k) and on the associated phase
velocity vp and group velocity vg. The short-wave limit
(2) is meaningful if and only if those two velocities possess
a ﬁnite limit. Then vp and vg allow to deﬁne asymptotic
variables and to handle the nonlinear regime [10, 11].

For the usual linearization of the Euler equations (with

surface tension), the linear dispersion relation

ω(k) = [k(g +

) tanh(kh)]1/2

(3)

T k2
σ

(T k/σ)1/2

. This
yields in the short-wave limit vp ∼
not only prevents us from deﬁning asymptotic variables
but also inﬁnite dispersion cannot be compensated by
weak nonlinearities. We found that the solution to this
problem is to employ the Green-Nagdhi conditions of lin-
earization.

The basic model. Green, Laws and Nagdhi [12, 13, 14]
developed alternative reductions of the Euler equations
leading to models having dispersion relations with good
behavior in the short-wave limit, as demonstrated in [10].
They used three main hypothesis, namely non irrota-
tional ﬂuid ﬂow, motion in vertical columns and non-
Archimedian pressure condition. For seek of complete-
ness, we derive hereafter the model in a simple manner
and include surface tension.

Let the particles of the ﬂuid be identiﬁed in a ﬁxed rect-
angular Cartesian system of center O and axes (x, y, z)
with Oz the upward vertical direction. We assume trans-
lational symmetry in y and we will only consider a sheet
of ﬂuid in the xz plane. This ﬂuid sheet is moving on
a rigid bottom at z = 0 and its upper free surface is
z = S(x, t). The continuity equation and the Newton

equations (in the ﬂow domain) read

ux + wz = 0,
σ(ut + uux + wuz) =
σ(wt + uwx + wwz) =

This constitutes our basic model.

Asymptotic model for short capillary-gravity waves.
In contrast with shallow water theories with dispersion
(Boussinesq type equations), this model incorporates ﬁ-
nite dispersion both in the long-wave and in the short-
wave limits. Indeed the linear dispersion relation is

Ω2 = k2[gh + (T h/σ)k2]/[1 + (hk)2/3].

With the power series u = ǫ2(u0 + ǫ2u2 + . . .) and S =

an equation for u0(ζ, τ ) which, in the laboratory variable,

This is valid for λ < 1 and for uxx small enough so
that F is real. If uxx is large, a similar change leads to
the cosh-Gordon equation, and if λ > 1 one obtains the
sine-Gordon equation. Finally, for λ = 1, one obtains
for g(y, t) = uxx/(1
uxx) the equation of a free ﬁeld in
−
light-cone coordinates.

Whatever the value of λ, it follows from the change
of variables (x, t)
(y, t) that a regular g(y, t) can give
back a singular, multivalued u(x, t) if the change from y
is

large enough, forcing uxx to inﬁnity and a change of sign
of F in the equation for y. We give an example of this in
ﬁg. 1, where two solutions for u are plotted from breather
solutions of the sine-Gordon equation, one (dashed curve)
with an amplitude just below the singularity threshold,
so that u is still regular and single-valued, the other (solid
curve) with an amplitude above the singularity threshold,
which displays a swallowtail behavior.

Furthermore, this singularity and multivaluedness can
be reached in ﬁnite time from a regular solution. In par-
ticular, in the sine-Gordon case, one can start from a
solution g(y, t) consisting of two breathers far enough
from each other and each weak enough so that the change
y
x is single valued, but strong enough so that when
becomes large enough for the singular-
they overlap,
ity to appear. In the free ﬁeld case λ = 1, and even in
the sinh-Gordon case, one can replace the breathers with
wave packets, and make them collide and give rise to this
singularity before they disperse. In all these cases, the
singularity in u is a swallowtail just like in ﬁgure 1.

The (singular, multivalued) u(x, t) corresponding to
the sine-Gordon soliton for g(y, t) is also interesting. It
is displayed on ﬁgure 2 for the particular value λ = 10/9.

For λ = 0, equation (19) was already discussed in
[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], and it contains peakons. These
peakons, which are solitons, and their scattering are qual-
itatively very easy to study via the change of variables to
the sinh-Gordon equation, where they correspond to sin-
gular solutions obtained by simple analytic continuations
of the sine-Gordon multisoliton solutions.

For any value of λ, the equation (19) has the symme-
a2u, for arbitrary real
try x
u
a, which is just the Lorentz group in 1+1 dimensions.
Although the Lagrangian (20) does not have the appro-
priate covariance property to give a Lorentz invariant
action, the system, being integrable, has an inﬁnite set
of Lagrangians (and derived Hamiltonians and Poisson
brackets) leading to the same equation of motion (19),
and one of them, built with the invariant ﬁeld uxx, leads
to an invariant action.

Benjamin-Feir instability. The Benjamin-Feir insta-
bility results from resonant interaction of an initial
monochromatic wave with side-band modes produced
by nonlinearity. This instability, which modulates the
carrier envelope,
is well described by the nonlinear
Schr¨odinger asymptotic limit.

Following the standard approach [3] we can show that

a Stokes wave train of equation (1) is unstable if

θ <

10

,

(28)

namely any slight deformation of the plane wave expe-
riences an exponential growth. In the case of water at
room temperature (T = 0.074 N m−1, σ = 103 kg m−3),
we obtain that a short wave train is unstable for a depth
h > 0.49 cm.

Last but not least, the value θ = 3/10 corresponds to

λ = 1 in (19). Precisely

θ < 0.3

λ > 1.

Comments. The occurence of singular (even multival-
ued) solutions in an equation derived in a hydrodynamics
framework is interesting, especially since u is the devia-
tion of the free surface from equilibrium. The actual ob-
servability of the present singular behaviors would require
a more detailed analysis of the validity of the short-wave
approximation near the singular points which goes be-
yond the scope of this paper. In particular the inclusion
of viscosity, which acts strongly over small scales, will
aﬀect the short-waves dynamics and alter these singular
behaviors.

The Green-Naghdi equations can be improved system-
atically toward higher depths [21].
In the linear limit,
these improvements give the higher (N, N ) Pad´e approx-
imants of the Euler dispersion relation (3), the present
case (16) corresponding to N = 1.
In particular they
always lead to a ﬁnite phase velocity in the short-wave
limit, which grows quickly as the order of the approxi-
mation grows to try to mimic the behavior of the exact
formula.

4

What is remarkable is that the short-wave asymptotics
of these improvements lead to exactly the same integrable
equation (1) except for diﬀerent numerical coeﬃcients in
front of the physical quantities g, h, θ and v. Hence we
hope that at least some the main features of the singular
behavior of the solutions correspond to the actual physics
of these water waves in arbitrary depth.

Another point is the existence of a peakon solution in
the case λ = 0. In the rescaling leading from equation
(1) to equation (19), this value of λ is obtained only for
θ = 1/3, where the rescaling is singular for the x, t and u
variables themselves, so that the whole asymptotics must
be reconsidered from the start. This value θ = 1/3 in the
Euler equation leads to a dispersionless system for small
k only and it is a peculiar feature of the Green-Naghdi
equations to be dispersionless for all k (hence for large k)
for that value of θ. This large k feature is not inherited
by the improvements of [21].

Equation (1) has a Lorentz invariance, and its quantum
version promises to exhibit new features not shared by
the existing relativistic systems in 1+1 dimension. This
new relativistic integrable system, with just one massive
bosonic ﬁeld and a local classical equation of motion, is
quite intriguing.
In particular, the change of variable
which transforms it into sine- or sinh-Gordon mixes the

t

x

t, x

→ −

space-time variable x and the ﬁeld uxx and furthermore
requires the equation of motion to be satisﬁed. Hence,
it cannot be quantum mechanically equivalent to sine- or
sinh-Gordon. For example, it is not parity invariant (par-
ity in the laboratory frame, x+t
t).
From this follows an unusual S-matrix, in which there
are two phase-shifts, one for the left moving particle and
one for the right moving one. The quantum ﬁeld the-
ory and mathematical structures following from this are
worth a detailed study for themselves in separate pub-
lications. This could also have some analogy in general
relativity, where space-time is, through the metric, a dy-
namical variable and where one can go from a choice of
space-time parametrization to another one by a change
which can involve the metric itself.

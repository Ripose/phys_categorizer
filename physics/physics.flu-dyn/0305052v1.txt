(Dated: 03/20/03)

The relation between rotating plane Couette and Taylor-Couette ﬂows is clariﬁed. The identity of
their linear stability limits is explained by considering the eﬀect of the Coriolis force in the rotating
frame. Experimental data are used to quantify the behavior of the minimum Reynolds number for
subcritical turbulence as a function of rotation and curvature. This last dependence is understood
through a phenomenological analysis, which also implies that the Coriolis force reduces the eﬃciency
of subcritical turbulent transport with respect to nonrotating ﬂows, as observed numerically.

PACS numbers: 47.10.+g; 47.20.Ft; 47.27.Ak; 47.27.Pa

Shear ﬂows constitute one of the prototypical type of
hydrodynamical ﬂows. Furthermore, they are commonly
found in various instances, e.g. geophysical and astro-
physical contexts. This makes the understanding of their
properties an important issue from both a fundamental
and a practical point of view. Most prominently, char-
acterizing turbulence and turbulent transport in such
ﬂows is critically needed, as astrophysical and geophysi-
cal shear ﬂows are usually fully turbulent because of the
large scales involved.

A large body of experimental evidence has been col-
lected on Taylor-Couette ﬂows in the linearly unstable
regime (see, e.g., Ref. [1] and references therein). Much
less is known about the linearly stable, or subcritical,
regime [2, 3, 4]. Plane Couette ﬂows (rotating or not)
are more diﬃcult to realize experimentally, and have been
less extensively studied [5, 6, 7].

On the theoretical side, intense eﬀorts have been de-
voted to the understanding of turbulence spectral and
statistical properties (see, e.g., [8] for an introduction to
the subject); also, mostly for practical purposes, rather
complex turbulent transport models have been developed
[9]. Unfortunately, in spite of these remarkable successes,
some basic properties such as magnitude of the critical
Reynolds number of fully developed turbulence, or its
dependence on rotation, are not yet understood. Worse,
even the most sophisticated Reynolds stress closure mod-
els fail to account for the existence of subcritical turbu-
lence in the presence of a stabilizing rotation.

Some of these shortcomings are addressed in the
present investigation, mostly through a phenomenolog-
ical analysis of the eﬀects of rotation and curvature in
rotating plane Couette ﬂows and Taylor-Couette ﬂows.
This provides us with an understanding of some of the
characteristic features of subcritical shear turbulence,
and, most importantly from a practical point of view, es-
tablishes a relation between the eﬃciency of subcritical
turbulent transport and the magnitude of the minimum
turbulent Reynolds number. The emphasis on subcriti-
cal turbulence follows for the following reasons. First, an
analysis of angular momentum transport suggests that
both linearly stable and unstable fully turbulent Taylor-

Couette ﬂows are controlled by similar nonlinear physics
[2, 10]. Secondly, it turns out that subcritical shear ﬂows
are easier to analyze from a phenomenological point of
view, and they are in any case important in themselves.
Let us ﬁrst reexamine the connection between rotat-
ing plane Couette ﬂows and Taylor-Couette ﬂows. The
Navier-Stokes equation for rotating plane Couette ﬂows
reads, in the rotating frame

∂w
∂t

∇P ∗
ρ

+ w.∇w = −

− 2Ω × w + ν∆w.

(1)

In this equation, P ∗ represents the sum of the inertial
term and of the gas pressure term, as usual when con-
sidering incompressible ﬂows. Such ﬂows are character-
ized by two dimensionless numbers, the Reynolds number
Re = ∆V ∆L/ν ∼ |w.∇w/ν∆w|, and a rotation (inverse
Rossby) number Ro = ǫ2Ω∆L/∆V ∼ |2Ω × w/w.∇w|,
which is a global measure of the rotation parameter de-
ﬁned by S ≡ −2Ω/(dV /dy). In these deﬁnitions, the x
axis is assumed to lie in the streamwise direction, the
y axis in the shearwise direction, and the z axis in the
spanwise direction (rotation axis); V (y) is the mean ﬂow
(along x). The rotation number is positive (resp. neg-
ative) (ǫ = ±1) depending on whether the rotation is
cyclonic (resp. anticyclonic).

Stability limits for inviscid rotating plane Couette
ﬂows can be determined through a displaced particle
analysis [11, 12].
Indeed, although the work of the
Coriolis force vanishes, the component of this work in
the streamwise direction during a ﬂuid particle displace-
ment in the shearwise direction does not. Comparing
the resulting post-displacement streamwise velocity to
the equilibrium one implies that the ﬂow is linearly un-
stable if −1 < S < 0, and linearly stable otherwise.
The oscillation frequency of ﬂuid particles is given by
(dV /dy)2S(S + 1), a result that lies at the root of the
analogy between stratiﬁed and rotating ﬂows.

The Navier-Stokes equation for Taylor-Couette ﬂows
is most meaningfully compared to that of rotating plane
Couette ﬂows when it is dispelled in a frame rotating
with the characteristic rotation velocity of the ﬂow Ωo

(e.g., the average angular velocity of the two cylinders),
as only diﬀerential rotation plays a role in the generation
of turbulence. Designating by w and φ the velocity and
azimuthal coordinate in the rotating frame, the Navier-
Stokes equation for w = (wr, wφ, wz) becomes

∂w

(2)

where P ∗ includes again all gradient terms, and

w.∇′w ≡ (w.∇wr)er + [rw.∇(wφ/r)]eφ+

(w.∇wz)ez.

(3)

With this new deﬁnition, the contribution of the az-
imuthal velocity derivative to the “advection” term van-
ishes when the ﬂuid is not sheared; as a consequence,
the w.∇′w can appropriately be named the “advection-
shear” term. This reexpression of the Navier-Stokes
equation is essential: explicitly isolating shear terms in
the advection term distinguishes the eﬀect of the shear,
as characterized by the Reynolds number, from the oth-
ers, the ﬂow curvature and rotation. Indeed, with respect
to rotating plane Couette ﬂows, Eq. (1), two new terms
are added, w2
θ /r and 2wrwθ/r, which represent the eﬀect
of the curvature of the ﬂow due to the cylindrical geom-
etry. Furthermore, this expression of the Navier-Stokes
equation makes the presence and the eﬀect of the Coriolis
force explicitly apparent in the rotating frame. This also
makes the relation to rotating plane Couette ﬂows more
direct. For these reasons, Eq. (2) is extremely helpful
to develop a correct physical analysis of Taylor-Couette
ﬂows.

This reexpression of the Navier-Stokes equation shows
that the three dimensionless numbers which best char-
acterize Taylor-Couette ﬂows are the Reynolds num-
ber Re = R∆Ω∆R/ν ∼ |w.∇′w/ν∆w|, the rotation
number Ro = ǫ2Ω∆R/R∆Ω ∼ |2Ωo × w/w.∇′w|,
which is a global measure of the rotation parameter
S = 2Ω/(rdΩ/dr) [23], and the curvature number Rc =
∆R/R ∼ w2/(r|w.∇′w|, which is a global measure of
the curvature parameter C = 2wθ/(r2dΩ/dr). As will be-
come apparent shortly, these numbers are to be preferred
over the most widely used inner and outer Reynolds num-
ber, and ratio of cylinder radii η.

Note also that rotating plane Couette ﬂows can be
viewed as a limiting case of Taylor-Couette ﬂows, when
Rc → 0 at ﬁnite Ro. This implies that there must
be a connection between the stability limit of rotating
plane Couette ﬂows recalled above, and the Rayleigh
criterion.
Indeed, the displaced particle analysis pre-
sented above is easily transposed to Taylor-Couette ﬂows

2

[13]. Let us consider a ﬂuid particle at some arbitrary
radius ro, and chose Ωo = Ω(ro). With this choice,
the curvature terms are second order with respect to
the radial displacement of the particle, and can be ne-
glected. Therefore, the argument for rotating plane Cou-
ette ﬂows applies in exactly the same way to Taylor-
Couette ﬂows, and implies that they are linearly unstable
when −1 < S ≡ 2Ω/(rdΩ/dr) < 0, where S is evaluated
at r = ro. Equivalently, the restoring (or destabilizing)
frequency is (rdΩ/dr)2S(S+1) = (2Ω/r)d(r2Ω)/dr. This
implies that stability follows when the Rayleigh criterion
is satisﬁed, as expected, and shows that this criterion
can be reinterpreted in terms of the action of the Corio-
lis force in the rotating frame.

A similar relation exists between the two types of ﬂows
in what concerns the minimum Reynolds number for the
onset of subcritical turbulence. However, as will soon
become apparent, this quantity for Taylor-Couette ﬂows
depends both on rotation number and curvature number,
an important feature whose meaning and consequences
have apparently escaped attention until now.

Transition to turbulence in subcritical ﬂows apparently
occurs directly, without undergoing the series of bifurca-
tions which is characteristic of linearly unstable ﬂows.
Note however that the minimum turbulent Reynolds
number is not deﬁned in a clear-cut way, as the transi-
tion from laminar to turbulent occurs in general at higher
Reynolds number than the transition from turbulent to
laminar, and as there is a range of Reynolds numbers
over which the ﬂow changes from highly intermittent to
fully turbulent. Nevertheless, the data quoted here are
more or less directly comparable, as they are rather char-
acteristic of fully turbulent ﬂows, except for the data of
Ref. [4], which are therefore used in a qualitative rather
than quantitative way in the discussion, when needed.

The available data on cyclonically rotating plane Cou-
ette ﬂows imply that the minimum turbulent Reynolds
number increases with the rotation number as [6]

Rem ≃ Rec + acRo,

(4)

where Rec ≃ 1400 is the transition Reynolds number of
plane Couette ﬂows [5], and ac ≃ 26000. The data were
obtained for low cyclonic (0.1 & Ro) rotation.

The experimental results of Wendt and Taylor for
Taylor-Couette ﬂows in cyclonic rotation were obtained
by maintaining the inner cylinder at rest. In this case,
Rc = Ro = ∆R/R, which makes it a priori diﬃcult to
distinguish the eﬀects of rotation from those of curva-
ture. Nevertheless, for ∆R/R . 1/20, the data are
clearly consistent with Eq. (4) (in agreement with the
existence of the rotating plane Couette ﬂow limit for
Taylor-Couette ﬂows), while for ∆R/R & 1/20, the min-
imum Reynolds number varies as Rem ≃ Re∗(∆R/R)2,
with Re∗ ≃ 6 × 105 [10]. This last behavior is necessarily

due to the eﬀect of the ﬂow curvature, and not rota-
tion. This follows ﬁrst because the predictions of Eq. (4)
fall way below the required minimum turbulent Reynolds
number when extrapolated to larger ∆R/R, and because
the experiments of Wendt for marginally stable anticy-
clonic ﬂows are globally consistent with the quadratic
dependence of Rem for large enough ∆R/R [13]; also,
the results of Ref. [4] are in qualitative agreement with
this conclusion [13]. All these arguments imply that, for
cyclonically rotating Taylor-Couette ﬂows,

Rem ≃ Rec + acRo + Re

∗

R2
c.

(5)

This relation applies to moderate rotation rates (Ro .
1/2), where the extrapolation of Eq. (4) is still valid and
the turbulence still three-dimensional. The fact that the
rotation and curvature contributions add, and not super-
sede one another, is implied by the data of Richard [4]
(see Ref. [13] for details). Notice that the contributions
of either rotation or curvature become comparable to Rec
when the rotation or curvature number is ≃ 1/20. This
remarkable feature is no coincidence.
Indeed, the tur-
bulence regeneration mechanism identiﬁed in nonrotat-
ing plane Couette ﬂows [14, 15] has an overall timescale
tturb ≃ 100(dU/dy)−1 ≃ 100(rdΩ/dr)−1. The timescale
associated with the Coriolis term is Ω, while the timescale
associated with the the curvature terms is wθ/r ≃ ∆Ω.
Therefore, these eﬀects are expected to signiﬁcantly af-
fect the turbulence regeneration mechanism when these
timescales are comparable to a few times tturb, or equiva-
lently, when Ro or Rc exceed a few percents. This phys-
ical constraint is what primarily determines the magni-
tude of ac and Re∗ (once the form of the dependence on
Ro and Rc is known).

The explanation of the dependence of Rem on Rc of
Zeldovich [16] is inconsistent with some of the data [10],
while the explanation of Dubrulle [17] is incompatible
with the fact that this is an eﬀect of the ﬂow curva-
ture.
In fact, it can be understood by extending the
turbulent viscosity description [18], an argument which
is clariﬁed and noticeably improved here. Characterizing
turbulent ﬂuctuations responsible for turbulent transport
by their coherence scale lM and velocity ﬂuctuation vM ,
a simple analogy with molecular transport implies that
[19] hδvrδvφi ≃ νtrdhΩi/dr, with νt ≃ lM vM . In a Kol-
mogorov cascade picture, the rate of energy dissipation
ǫ can be expressed in terms of the same quantities as
ǫ ≃ C∗v3
M /lM ≃ (νt/2)(rdhΩi/dr)2, where C∗ ≃ 0.1 is
a rather universal constant [9]. Finally, a ﬂow submit-
ted to a velocity shear tries to restore thermodynamic
equilibrium by suppressing the shear and transporting
momentum in the shearwise direction. A linearly sta-
ble system has only two means to achieve this purpose,
laminar or subcritical turbulent transport, and will chose
the most eﬃcient one. Turbulent transport is dominant
when |hδvrδvφi| & ν|rdΩ/dr|, so that, at the transition

to turbulence, νt = Cν ν where Cν is a constant of order
unity. Taken together, these relations imply that

where ∆r is the typical scale of the shear away from the
boundaries, and r∆Ω the corresponding shear amplitude.
Let us focus for the time being on Taylor-Couette sys-
tems dominated by the curvature. By making the outer
cylinder radius arbitrarily large, this last relation implies
that, if Rem were constant (independent of the relative
gap width), the turbulent scales could become arbitrar-
ily larger than the radius, at any given radial location
in the ﬂow, which makes no sense. Reversely, this shows
that the local radius r, at any ﬂow location, must impose
a limiting scale.
Indeed, by imposing lM = γr (where
the proportionality constant γ will soon be determined),
Eq. (7) is equivalent to [24]

In the same vein, the resulting turbulent velocity ex-
pression νt ≃ (Cν /Re∗)r3|∆Ω/∆r| ≡ βr3dΩ/dr also im-
plies that in this regime, turbulence is controlled by lo-
cal rather than global conditions in the bulk of the ﬂow.
The data of Wendt [3] imply that β ≃ 10−5 [10], so that
Cν ≃ 6 and γ ≃ 1/500.

If turbulence in the bulk of the ﬂow is controlled by
local conditions, this implies that the width of the ﬂow
plays no role in the curvature dominated regime (except
indirectly through the way global conditions might con-
trol local ones). This surprising conclusion can be under-
stood in the following way. For narrow gap widths (still
neglecting the eﬀect of rotation), the ﬂow reduces to a
(nonrotating) plane Couette ﬂow, and turbulence occurs
as soon as R∆Ω∆R/ν exceeds Rec. When ∆R & R/20,
the mean radius R locally deﬁnes radial “boxes” of size
R/20 which are turbulent if (rdΩ/dr)(R/20)2/ν & Rec,
so that, for the shear to be large enough on scale R/20,
the Reynolds number must increase quadratically with
the gap width.
Incidentally, this shows that the tur-
bulence regeneration mechanism in curvature dominated
ﬂows must be closely related to the one that operates
in nonrotating plane Couette ﬂows. Consequently, the
mechanism identiﬁed in Ref. [14, 15] is probably more
than a near-wall turbulence regeneration mechanism.
Note in this respect that this mechanism is largely in-
sensitive to the actual nature of the boundary condition,
as long as a box size is deﬁned.

What has been achieved so far ? The magnitude of Rec
is explained by the regeneration mechanism just men-
tioned, while the magnitudes of ac and Re∗ have been
constrained from the overall time scale of this mecha-
nism; the meaning of the quadratic dependence on Rc
has also been brought to light. Only the linear depen-
dence of Rem on Ro still needs to be explained. As the
Coriolis force term does not pinpoint a particular length
scale (only a time scale is involved), in contrast to the
curvature term, the ﬂow rotation is expected to aﬀect
the regeneration mechanism in an important way, so that
this behavior is beyond the scope of the phenomenolog-
ical analysis developed here. It is essential to note that
the turbulent transport νt ≃ lM vM based on Eqs. (6) and
(7) is valid for all Re > Rem, as long as the turbulence
regeneration mechanism does not change with increas-
ing Reynolds number; this follows because increasing the
Reynolds number only increases the range of the inertial
spectrum, while the regeneration mechanism necessarily
acts on larger scales [13, 18]. This feature always al-
lows us to relate the minimum Reynolds number to the
transport eﬃciency through Eqs. (6) and (7) and the tur-
bulent viscosity prescription, an essential feature from a
practical point of view.

Finally, the dependence of Rem on Ro allows us to
resolve an important controversy on the relevance of
subcritical shear turbulence to accretion disk transport.
Most astrophysicists now believe that the Coriolis force
relaminarizes shear ﬂows in the anticyclonic regime (in
particular in the “keplerian”, Ro = −4/3, regime), on
the basis of two sets of simulations [20, 21] performed
for rotating plane Couette ﬂows with pseudo-periodic
boundary conditions and with a tidal term included in
the generalized pressure P ∗. On the other hand, a mi-
nority insists that this point of view is inconsistent with
the experimental evidence [10]. This last claim is indeed
correct [4, 13]; however, this does not imply that the sim-
ulations are faulty, as is now argued. First, although no
usable data are available in the relevant rotation domi-
nated anticyclonic regime, the approximate “Richardson
similarity” of rotating ﬂows [22] (valid for the low ro-
tation numbers of interest here) implies that the mini-
mum Reynolds number of anticyclonic ﬂows (Ro 6 −1)
behaves as Rem ≃ Rec + aac|1 + Ro| with aac & ac
(see Ref. [13] for details). This implies that the turbu-
lent amplitude decreases steeply with the rotation num-
ber, as implied by the simulations. More precisely, for
Ro = −4/3, ∆R/lM ∼ (∆V )/vM & a few 100, so that
M /(Ω∆R)2 ∼ 10−4−10−5. These ﬁgures are marginally
v2
consistent with the largest resolution adopted in the sim-
ulations, but quite consistent with the reported velocity
ﬂuctuations.

Besides the potential problem with the simulation res-
olution just pointed out, the numerical results were most

4

probably not recognized as characteristic of turbulence,
because the reduction of the velocity ﬂuctuations induced
by the Coriolis force runs contrary to common expecta-
tions, according to which the turbulent scales and veloc-
ity ﬂuctuations are comparable to the scale of the ﬂow,
and mean velocity diﬀerence on this scale. On the con-
trary, the analysis presented here implies that rotation re-
duces the transport generating velocity ﬂuctuations with
respect to nonrotating ﬂows. A fuller account of the rele-
vance of these features to accretion disk turbulent trans-
port will be given elsewhere [13].

[23] The change of sign in the deﬁnition of S results from the
proper identiﬁcation of the various axes between rotation
plane Couette ﬂows and Taylor-Couette ﬂows.

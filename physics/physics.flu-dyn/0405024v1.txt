Based on the generalized kinetic equation for the one-particle distribution function with a small
source, the transition from the kinetic to the hydrodynamic description of many-particle systems is
performed. The basic feature of this new technique to obtain the hydrodynamic limit is that the lat-
ter has been partially incorporated into the kinetic equation itself. The hydrodynamic equations for
capillary ﬂuids are derived from the characteristic function for the local moments of the distribution
function. The Fick’s law appears as a consequence of the transformation law for the hydrodynamic
quantities under time inversion.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Van der Waals gradient theory [1] was originally
developed at the end of the 19-th century as an ”eﬀec-
tive” physical picture to describe the critical region. This
theory considers a local Helmholtz free-energy composed
of two parts. The ﬁrst one describes the homogeneous
behaviour of the system, while the second part character-
izes the non-homogeneous one. In addition, the ﬁrst part
is proportional to the ﬂuid density ̺ while the second
one is proportional to the square of the density gradi-
ent. Much eﬀort has been devoted to apply the Van der
Waals gradient theory to various ﬂuids. At present, it
can be considered as the most simple and comprehensive
model in the physics of interfaces and capillarity. The
associated hydrodynamic equations can be written as

formulation of the Van der Waals theory was originally
due to Korteweg [3], who proposed a continuum mechan-
ical model in which the Cauchy stress tensor apart from
the standard Cauchy-Poisson term contains an additional

the Korteweg model refers to elastic materials of grade n,
where the particular case of n = 3 has been well studied
in recent years [5].

Equations (1) and (2) have been linked recently [6, 7]
to a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation viewed as a partic-
ular set of hydrodynamic equations describing the so-
called nonlinear Madelung ﬂuid [8, 9]. This link be-
tween capillarity and the Schr¨odinger equation can shed
more light onto the so-called quantum-like approach to
many-particle systems such as beams in particle accelera-
tors and beam-plasma systems. The standard procedure
in this direction is to approximate the physical systems
characterized by an overall interaction with a suitable
Van der Waals mean ﬁeld theory.

To avoid misunderstanding, it is worthwhile to note
that Schr¨odinger equation alone does not provide an en-
tire quantum mechanical picture. It should be necessar-
ily supplemented by a theory of quantum measurement
and consequently by a proper physical interpretation of
wave packets. In the quantum-like approach, the many-
particle systems are described in an eﬀective way as a
whole. Based on the above considerations, it appears
interesting and attractive to explore the possibility of a
rigorous derivation from kinetic theory of the general hy-
drodynamic picture thus discussed.

II. THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK

The starting point of our analysis is the equation for

the microscopic phase space density NM (x, p; t)

(3)

for a system consisting of N particles, which occupies
volume V in the conﬁguration space. Here x and p are
the coordinates and the canonically conjugate momenta,
m is the particle mass and FM (x, p; t) is the microscopic
force, which apart from the external force includes a part
specifying the type of interaction between particles. Sup-
pose that at some initial time t0 the microscopic phase

space density is known to be NM0(x, p; t0). Then, the
formal solution of equation (4) for arbitrary time t can
be written as

NM (x, p; t) =

(t; t0)NM0(x, p; t0),

(5)

(t; t0) is the evolution operator, specifying the

S

where

The choice of the initial NM0(x, p; t0) is based on the
knowledge of the microscopic characteristics of the sys-
tem. Due to the extremely complex particles’ dynam-
ics, full consistent description is not feasible. Therefore,
the detailed information on the microscopic level is in-
complete.
If our system is a complex one in the sense
that both the external forces and the collective forces are
highly nonlinear, a dynamic instability of motion is likely
to occur on a characteristic time scale τ . The only in-
formation available to an outside observer by means of
a macroscopic measuring device is a coarse-grained den-
sity distribution with a smoothing function, which takes
into account the dynamic instability of motion. Thus, we
assume

NM0(x; t0) =

NM (x; t0) =

Z

e

(6)
where for simplicity the explicit dependence on the mo-
mentum variables p has been suppressed. To take into
account the initial preparation of the system, one has to
and perform an aver-
displace the initial time t0 at
age over the past history of the system. Then equation
(4) becomes [10]

The generalized kinetic equation (8) has a form anal-
ogous to the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) equation,
widely used in the kinetic theory of gases [11]. There
is however, an important conceptual diﬀerence between
f
the two equations. In the BGK equation the function
should be replaced by the equilibrium distribution func-
e
tion f0 describing the global equilibrium and the charac-
teristic time τ should be replaced by the corresponding
relaxation time. The smoothed distribution function in
equation (8) characterizes a local quasi-equilibrium state
within the smallest unit cell of continuous medium, while
τ is the corresponding time scale.

In order to ﬁnd the explicit form of the internal stress
tensor (25), we observe that the maximum entropy of
the system is realized, provided the small source in the
generalized kinetic equation (8) vanishes. This condition
is equivalent to the condition of detailed balance in the
case, where the collision integral (small source) is ap-
proximated by a Fokker-Planck operator. The condition
of detailed balance implies that the distribution function
factorizes in the form

where α = 3kBT /m. Thus, the hydrodynamic equations
describing a free capillary ﬂuid have been recovered.
In the case, where an external force is applied, the Ko-
rteweg stress tensor contains an additional term propor-
tional to the drift coeﬃcient A. On the other hand from
the principle of detailed balance, it follows that the drift
coeﬃcient is proportional to the external force. The
physical implication of the latter is that the additional
term in the Korteweg stress tensor can be regarded as a
coupling between the external ﬁeld and the mean ﬁeld of
purely hydrodynamical origin.

Since a detailed information about the system on the
microscopic level is incomplete, one possible way to take
into account its initial preparation, i. e. an eventual
dynamic instability of motion that might have set in
and/or other large-scale characteristics, is to introduce
a suitable smoothing procedure. As a result, the kinetic
equation providing an uniﬁed kinetic, hydrodynamic and
diﬀusion description contains a small source and is there-
fore irreversible. Although the eﬀective collision integral
(small source) can be represented as a Kramers-Moyal
expansion, for the purposes of the present paper it suf-
ﬁces to consider the right-hand-side of the generalized ki-
netic equation as approximated with a properly deﬁned
Fokker-Planck operator. The latter form of the collision
term is adopted as a starting point in the derivation of
the hydrodynamic equations for capillary ﬂuids.
The hydrodynamic approximation is further obtained in
a standard manner from the characteristic function for
the local moments of the distribution function. An im-
portant feature of the approach is that the Fick’s law
emerges naturally from the transformation properties of
the hydrodynamic quantities under time inversion. The
osmotic velocity is uniquely speciﬁed by the ﬁrst two in-
ﬁnitesimal moments of the smoothing function and in a
sense is a measure of the irreversibility.
The main result of the analysis performed in this paper,
the hydrodynamic equations for free capillary ﬂuids have
been derived from kinetic theory.
If an external force
is present, the Korteweg stress tensor has to be modiﬁed
accordingly. An additional term proportional to the drift
coeﬃcient emerges implying a coupling between the ex-
ternal ﬁeld and the mean ﬁeld of purely hydrodynamical
origin.

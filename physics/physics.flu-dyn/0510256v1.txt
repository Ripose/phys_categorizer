Abstract. – A weakly deformable droplet impinging on a rigid surface rebounds if the surface
is intrinsically hydrophobic or if the gas ﬁlm trapped underneath the droplet is able to keep the
interfaces from touching. A simple, physically motivated model inspired by analysis of droplets
colliding with deformable interfaces is proposed in order to investigate the dynamics of the
rebound process and the eﬀects of gravity. The analysis yields estimates of the bounce time
that are in very good quantitative agreement with recent experimental data (Okumura et. al.,
(2003)) and provides signiﬁcant improvement over simple scaling results.

Introduction. – The collision and rebound of droplets has been a subject of interest and
investigation for many decades. Impacting drops undergo energetic bounces if the pressure
in the gas ﬁlm separating the drops deforms the drop surfaces suﬃciently to transform the
drop’s kinetic energy into deformation energy before contact occurs. Collisions in a incom-
pressible, continuum gas usually result in a bounce with contact occurring due to inter-particle
forces or surface imperfections1,2. Bouncing can also result when drops impinge on rigid super
hydrophobic3 surfaces or on rigid walls heated to well above the Leidenfrost temperature4,5.
Very recently, Okumura et. al.3, presented experimental data for the collision and rebound,
in air, of 400 − 1000 µm water drops from a super-hydrophobic surface. They found that the
measured bounce time was consistently larger than that predicted by simple scaling. Further-
more, with the drop radius held ﬁxed, the contact time was seen to increase signiﬁcantly as
the velocity of impact decreased. This was attributed to eﬀects of ﬁnite drop size and gravity.
In this letter, a physically motivated model is proposed to investigate this scenario, specif-
ically the dependence of the bounce time and deformation on droplet size and velocity. Use of
the methodology developed in similar problems involving droplets colliding with deformable
interfaces1,2, indicates that even when gravity is absent the bounce time for a liquid drop
increases as the impact velocity decreases. Consideration of gravity induced eﬀects suggests
that the bounce time is modestly modiﬁed relative to the zero-gravity value. The predicted
results are in excellent quantitative agreement with experimental data of Okumura et. al.,3
showing that both eﬀects are needed to account properly for the details of the bounce.

Fig. 1 – (a) Schematic of a drop of initial radius a approaching a rigid hydrophobic surface with scaled

a drop supported by a ﬁlm of gas, the gas pressure is O(2σ/a).

Dimensionless analysis yields reduced parameter space. – Consider a droplet of radius
a comprised of liquid with density ρd, viscosity µd and interfacial tension σ colliding with a
rigid ﬂat surface at impact speed Uc. Let the ambient gas be incompressible and continuum
with density ρg, pressure po and viscosity µg. Dimensional analysis then indicates that the
parameters determining the characteristics of the rebound process are - (a) the Weber numbers
based on drop and gas properties, Wd ≡ ρdU 2
c a/σ that measure the relative
importance of inertial pressures and surface pressure, (b) the capillary numbers based on
drop and gas viscosities, Cd ≡ µdUc/σ and Cd ≡ µgUc/σ, and (c) the Reynolds numbers
Rg ≡ aUcρg/µg and Rd ≡ aUcρd/µd characterizing viscous eﬀects in the gas and inside the
drop. The eﬀects of gravity are quantiﬁed by the Froude number, Fd ≡ U 2
c /(ag). Droplet
inertia is quantiﬁed by the Stokes number S ∼ O(Wd/Cg),that also measures the eﬀectiveness
of gas viscosity in dissipating the kinetic energy of the drop.

c aσ and Wg ≡ ρgU 2

A large number of physically relevant collisions occur at conditions satisfying Wd ≪ 1,
1/2
S ≫ 1, Rd → 0, Rg ≤ 1, W
d /Rd → 0 and Cg ≪ 1. In such cases, viscous dissipation inside
the drop and in the gas outside may be neglected during the collision process as long as the
droplet rebounds1. That is, the dissipation in the gas ﬁlm has a small impact on the bounce
provided we are far from the bounce-contact transition. The primary role of the ﬁlm is then
to cushion the droplet from physical contact with the surface. We expect the dynamics to
primarily depend on just two parameters - Wd and Fd and seek a theoretical description of
the approach and rebound in this special limit.

Collisions in zero gravity. – Consider for now collisions in gravity-less conditions so that
Fd = ∞. It is useful to ﬁrst visualize the approach and rebound scenario - for simplicity, let us
choose a collision occurring in the presence of a gas. For S ≫ 1, changes in the droplet velocity
occur only when the gap thickness, ho ≪ a, as a result of the large lubrication force in the gap.

) ≪ a. This is easily
Drop deformation becomes important when the gap thickness is O(aC
g
seen by balancing the viscous force exerted by the gas with the capillary pressure O(2σ/a).
The center of mass speed is chosen to be Uc at this point. As the gap becomes smaller, the
conﬁned air ﬁlm leads to a strong localized pressure that is O(2σ/a), that when seen from far
seems to act over a temporally varying nearly ﬂat region of radial extent rd(t) as depicted in
Figure (1a). Closer examination of the near-contact region as depicted in Figure (1b) reveals
that the inner region may in fact have a more complicated shape - for instance during the

A. Gopinath: Droplet rebound from rigid or strongly hydrophobic surfaces

approach, a dimple like shape is seen with a radius of roughly rd(t) and a gap thickness that
is a maximum at the centerline. Insofar as the bounce process itself is concerned, the detailed
shape of the inner region is of secondary importance - what is important is the angular extent
of the ﬂat region1,2. As the radius of the ﬂat region increases, the center of mass moves slower
as as more of the initial kinetic energy is channeled into surface deformation modes. At some
point, the centers of mass of the drops reverse their direction of motion and the drops begin
to rebound - during this process the ﬂat region begins to shrink and ﬁnally vanishes. For a
droplet colliding with a super-hydrophobic surface we expect a similar picture to apply. The
reason being that due to the nature of the surface-drop interaction, the contact angle is nearly
180o and the near-contact area is ﬂat to leading order here as well. Thus, drop is nearly
spherical except at a small region where it is ﬂat. This shape is reminiscent of the shape
found by Mahadevan and Pomeau8 for small drops rolling due to gravity.

Simple scalings1,2,3 for the bounce time and deformation are readily obtained. For the

This value, which we denote by τR, was ﬁrst obtained by Lord Rayleigh in his study of the
vibrational modes of a drop7. Note that the Rayleigh time scale is independent of the impact
velocity. The angular extent of the ﬂat region is obtained by a force balance on the drop and

To obtain a more accurate picture of the rebound process, the equations for the ﬂow inside
the drop have to be solved. The formulation follows directly from earlier work on collisions
with deformable interfaces1,2. A spherical coordinate system that is ﬁxed in space and time
in the interior of the droplet, such that the origin lies at a distance a from the rigid surface,
is chosen. The velocity ﬁeld in the drop is divergence free and governed by the Navier-Stokes

Equation set (3) is then solved in conjunction with the initial conditions Dk≥1(t = 0) = 0,
Bk≥2(t = 0) = 0 and B1(t = 0) = 1. The rebound is complete when the center of mass of
the droplet reaches its initial position viz., D1(t = Tb) = 0. Numerical solutions are obtained
for various values of Wd by using a second-order predictor-corrector method and varying the
number of modes until convergent results are obtained.

Figure (2) summarizes the results for Fd = ∞ and compares them to experimental obser-
vations of Okumura et.al.3. The solid line corresponds to the theoretical prediction obtained
by numerically solving equation (3). We notice immediately that in spite of the diﬀerent
impact velocities and sizes, there is a reasonable collapse of the experimental data around the
theoretical prediction, indicating that Wd is the relevant parameter to use. Good qualitative
and quantitative agreement is seen, especially for the smaller size drops. Some of the data
points for the 1 mm drop do diﬀer considerably from the predicted values but the reasons for
these are not clear. Nonetheless we ﬁnd that the theoretical result yields a good prediction
even as the Weber number becomes O(0.1).

Both experimental data (that include gravity eﬀects) and the numerical results (with-
out gravity) consistently indicate that as Wd decreases, the bounce time increases with
decreasing Uc. To investigate this behavior in more detail, analytical asymptotes for the
bounce time were obtained by a singular perturbation analysis of (3). It is found that when

then couples directly to the k = 1 translational mode. In other words, rather than deform
uniformly, the approaching drop prefers to ﬂatten the near contact region and shift the center
of mass appropriately in response to the ensuing force. A spring like motion manifests itself
wherein the center of mass executes a harmonic oscillation1,3 but like a non-linear spring that
stiﬀens strongly as Wd → 0.In fact, for asymptotically small Wd, the bounce time scales as,

while the maximum extent of the ﬂat region scales as αmax = [ 2Wd/(3 ln (W −1/4
)) ]1/4. As
the Weber number increases, all the deformation modes become equally important and the
separation of scales diminshes. The asymptotic expression in (4) consistently under-predicts
the actual bounce time since the analytical approximation is obtained by ignoring the k = 2
modes. For ﬁnite Wd, the symmetry between approach and rebound is broken. The eﬀects
of ﬁnite Weber number render the collision process asymmetric, increasingly so as the Weber
number approaches O(1) values.

First eﬀects of gravity. – The eﬀects of gravity cannot be ignored when Wd ∼ O(F 2
d ) i.e,
when the impact velocity is O(a3ρg2/σ)1/2 or smaller. To anticipate the eﬀects of gravity we
consider the case of weak but non-zero gravity. That is, Fd is ﬁnite but ε1 ≡ W
d ≪
1. Thus the droplet is still weakly deformed and the ﬂow and deformation modes are still
described by (2). Note that the small parameter ε1 is the ratio of the critical speed at which
gravity becomes important and the impact speed - that is ε1 ≡ ag(aρd/σ)1/2U −1
c ≡ Vg/Uc. A
measure of the importance of gravity in aﬀecting the bounce time is then obtained by scaling
the actual bounce time, T ′
b and then plotting this normalized
rebound time as a function of a suitable small parameter. Since the data for 400 micron
drops correspond most closely to the limits we are investigating, these are chosen to test the
theoretical predictions.

In their expression, the zero-gravity bounce time, (T 0
b )o = (2.3τR) is independent of Wd and
thus does not depend on the impact velocity. The bounce time as predicted increases by at
most a factor of 2 compared to the zero-gravity value. This expression is plotted as a dashed
curve in ﬁgure (3a) and compared to the experimental obtained data points normalized the
same way. The circles indeed map onto to small ε1 values but the normalized bounce times
are all much greater than unity. At ﬁrst sight this may seem to imply that gravity plays a
crucial role - however this is not quite correct. Since the true zero-gravity bounce time is
dependent on Wd, a more accurate reﬂection of gravity eﬀects is obtained upon incorporating
this dependence.

This corresponds to the drop being spherical and moving with speed Uc when the collision

It is clear that the bounce time increases relative to the zero-gravity value by a factor that is

Equation (8) shows surprisingly good agreement with the experimental data points which
seems to suggest that gravity acts as a weak perturbation for these droplets. Perhaps, a more
careful calculation in lieu of the simpliﬁed treatment just described will result in a better
prediction for larger values of ε2. Also note that the dashed and solid curves seem to have the
same form - this is of course primarily due to the way we have chosen to normalize the curves.
It should also be noted that if the direction in which gravity acts is not the same as that of
the initial droplet motion, axi-symmetry is broken and the bounce times can diﬀer noticeably.

Summary and conclusions. – To summarize, the collision and rebound dynamics of
2 ≪ (aρ/σ)−1,
weakly deforming drops impacting with velocities, Uc, satisfying (a3ρg2/σ) ≪ Uc
is controlled by the interplay between the kinetic energy of the drop and energy stored in sur-
face deformation due to ﬁnite surface tension, σ with gravity acting as a weak perturbation. In
b(ρa3/σ)−1/2, diverges as
the limit of asymptotically small Wd, the scaled bounce time Tb = T ′
ln1/2 [ (ρU 2
c a/σ)−1/4 ] when Uc → 0. To leading order, gravity tends to increase the time scale
for the bounce relative to the zero-gravity value. Results of numerical calculations indicate
that the bounce time increases relative to the asymptote as U 2
c → (aρ/σ)−1 - a manifesta-
tion of the increasing eﬀect of non-linear deformation modes and of the drop being deformed
everywhere rather than merely locally.

Is the O(aW
d

) local ﬂattening seen in the Wd ≪ 1 case, a precursor of the global
deformation seen in pancake shaped drops for Wd ≥ 1? It is tempting to think that as Wd → 1,
the maximum extent of the inner region grows till it becomes comparable to the drop radius a
with the transition between the inner and outer region becoming gentler. Consider increasing
the impact speed, Uc such that it becomes O(aρ/σ)−1/2 as happens when Wd ∼ O(1). In this
limit, gravity plays a negligible role. The strongly deforming droplet changes to a pancake
like shape with characteristic radius Rd ≥ a being diﬀerent from the height Hd ∼ O(a3R−2
d ).
The initial kinetic energy is transferred mainly into internal ﬂow modes within the drop. The
maximum extent of the pancake drop is determined by a balance between the ﬂow driven
by inertial acceleration and the ﬂow due to the surface tension induced pressure gradient
at the edge of the pancake. This yields the balance (ρdU 2
d/a6) thus yielding
(Rd/a)4 ∼ O(ρdU 2
c a/σ) ∼ O(Wd). Although the scalings for the maximal apparent contact
area seem to arise diﬀerently for cases Wd ≪ 1 and Wd ≫ 1, it is interesting and in some
sense satisfying to note that they exhibit the same dependence on Wd.

Abstract

The stability of shear ﬂows of electrically conducting ﬂuids, with respect to ﬁnite amplitude

three-dimensional localized disturbances is considered. The time evolution of the ﬂuid impulse

integral, characterizing such disturbances, for the case of low magnetic Reynolds number is obtained

by integrating analytically the vorticity equation. Analysis of the resulted equation reveals a new

instability criterion.

Introduction

The use of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for transition and turbulent control is quite attrac-

tive from the point of view of applications, in particular when new technologies may allow direct

turbulent control in sea water. Most of the work in this ﬁeld has been concerned with ﬂows of

electrically conducting ﬂuids subjected to transverse magnetic ﬁelds. This conﬁguration is used in

MHD generators, accelerators and pumps. Recently, Nosenchuck and Brown (1993), demonstrated

experimentally that the application of wall-normal Lorentz force prohibit lift-up and bursting of

near wall ﬂuid, which are characteristics of the end-stage of transition and near wall turbulence.

However, in such a conﬁguration, the magnetic eﬀects are due mainly to the coupling between the

mean velocity proﬁle and the magnetic ﬁeld, rather than the damping of turbulence.

On the other hand, when the mean ﬂow and the magnetic ﬁeld are aligned, the direct eﬀect of

the magnetic ﬁeld is on the disturbed velocity ﬁeld. Fraim and Heiser (1968) studied experimentally

the eﬀect of a strong longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld on the ﬂow of mercury in a circular tube. They

found that the magnetic ﬁeld can signiﬁcantly increase the critical Reynolds number (Recr) for

transition. More examples showing similar results are summarized in the book of Branover (1978),

who concluded that linear theories of stability of MHD ﬂows yield values of Recr which are much

1

higher than the measured values. This suggests that a proper explanation of the above mentioned

experimental results must take nonlinear eﬀects into account.

The evolution of a ﬁnite amplitude three-dimensional localized vortex disturbance embedded

in an external incompressible shear ﬂow was considered by Levinski & Cohen (1995, hereinafter

reﬀered to as LC). Using the ﬂuid impulse as an integral characteristic of such a disturbance,

they found that parallel shear ﬂows are always unstable with respect to localized disturbances, the

typical dimension of which δ, is much smaller than a dimensional length scale ∆, corresponding to

an
(1) change of the external velocity. Moreover, their analysis predicts that the growing vortex
disturbance is inclined at 450 to the external ﬂow direction, in a plane normal to the transverse

O

axis. It was also shown that although viscosity plays a crucial role in the generation of the initial

localized disturbance and in determining the mean ﬂow ﬁeld, it plays no role in the time evolution

of its ﬂuid impulse integral.

In other words, once the mean ﬁeld is established, the subsequent

evolution of the disturbance ﬂuid impulse integral is largely an inviscid one. These predictions

agree with previous experimental observations concerning the growth of hairpin vortices in laminar

and turbulent boundary layers, see e.g. Head & Bandyopadhyay (1981), Acarlar & Smith (1987)

and Hagen & Kurosaka (1993). The application of this approach to Taylor-Couette ﬂow revealed

a new instability criterion, which was recently veriﬁed experimentally by Cohen et al. (1996).

The purpose of the work reported here is to examine the eﬀect of an externally imposed magnetic

ﬁeld on the onset of such disturbances. The analysis is restricted to incompressible shear ﬂows

characterized by a low magnetic Reynolds number, Rem = µσ∆U

1, where µ is the magnetic

≪

permeability, σ is the electrical conductivity and U is a characteristic velocity scale of the external

ﬂow. The magnetic Reynolds number can be considered as the ratio between the diﬀusion time
scale of the magnetic ﬁeld µσ∆2, and the hydrodynamic time scale ∆/U . For small values of Rem,

the magnetic ﬁeld induced by a disturbance diﬀuses rapidly. This leads to the dissipation of the

disturbance kinetic energy and consequently may stabilize the ﬂow.

where ρ and ν are the density and kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid, respectively.

We consider the ﬂow ﬁeld as being the sum of two contributions: the external shear ﬁeld in which

U, and a ﬁnite amplitude disturbed ﬁeld in which ω =

Ω =
u. Thus, the total velocity and
vorticity vectors can be written as UT = U + u and ΩT = Ω + ω, where the undisturbed external

∇ ×

∇ ×

ﬂow ﬁeld is assumed to be a known solution of (1) and (2) when u = 0. The initial disturbed
vorticity ω(x, t0) = ω0(x) is assumed to be conﬁned to the small region of order δ

∆ as well

as δ

∆1, where ∆1 is a typical length scale corresponding to an

(1) change of the external

≪

magnetic ﬁeld.

Owing to the smallness of the disturbed region, the external velocity, vorticity and magnetic

ﬁelds are approximated by Taylor series expansions. Following LC, we use a Galilean frame, mov-

ing with the disturbance, i.e., U(0) = 0, and consider the initially embedded vorticity region as

surrounded by an inﬁnite ﬁeld having a constant velocity shear and a constant magnetic induction.

Consequently,

where x is the position vector, dV is a volume element and the time derivative of ω(x, t) is

determined from (4).

Since the time evolution of the ﬂuid impulse is an integral over the whole volume, we must

ﬁrst verify that most of the contribution to this integral comes from the localized disturbed region.

Indeed, all of the vorticity contributing to this integral, except for the part generated via the fourth

and the seventh (electromagnetic) terms in (4), is conﬁned to the disturbed region.

In order to estimate the contributions of the fourth and the seventh terms in (4), we examine

their far-ﬁeld behavior. The expression for the scalar potential φ is obtained from the general

where the asymptotic series of M, expressed in terms of the ﬂuid impulse, is given (Batchelor,

Substitution of (8) and (9) into (4) shows that the far-ﬁeld vorticity diminishes in magnitude as
−4. Consequently, the integral (6) is not absolutely convergent and depends on the way in which

the volume of integration is allowed to tend to inﬁnity.

In order to overcome this diﬃculty we follow the procedure proposed in LC. Accordingly, we
subdivide the velocity and vorticity ﬁelds into two parts, ω = ωI + ωII and u = uI + uII , so that

ωI,II =

uI,II. Therefore, for each part we require that

∇ ×

ωI =

ωII = 0.

The ﬁrst part, indicated by the superscript I, is associated with the concentrated vorticity conﬁned

within and in the vicinity of the initially disturbed region, whereas the second part, indicated by

the superscript II, is associated with the far-ﬁeld vorticity generated by the problematic terms (the

fourth and seventh) in (4). Accordingly, we set the initial distribution of the vorticity ﬁelds as:

ωI (x, t = t0) = ω0(x)

and

ωII (x, t = t0) = 0,

(11)

and follow the evolution of ωI (x, t). In addition, we subdivide the whole space into two regions,

inside and outside a spherical domain of radius R

δ, enclosing the disturbance. In the outer

Each one of the integrals in (22) is evaluated for a ﬁnite value of R1 and its limit as R1

is

then taken. The result of the ﬁrst integral in (22) was already obtained in LC. As shown in the

Appendix for such domains of integration, the integral contribution of the last three integrals in

(22) is identically zero. Therefore, the artiﬁcial vorticity ﬁeld has no direct impact on the evolution
of the ﬂuid impulse associated with the concentrated vorticity ωI (x, t). Moreover, as was shown in
LC, the inﬂuence of the vorticity ﬁeld ωII (x, t) on the evolution of ωI (x, t) can be neglected. The

second integral in (22) is calculated using a similar procedure to that described in the Appendix

3 Application to a representative example

In the following we consider a simple example in which (23) is applied to a parallel shear ﬂow of elec-

trically conducting ﬂuids and a new instability criterion for ﬁnite amplitude localized disturbances

is found. For a parallel plane shear ﬂow, the external velocity ﬁeld is given by U = (U (y), 0, 0) ,

for which a right-handed coordinate system is used with x = (x, y, z), where the vector entries are

the downstream, cross-ﬂow and spanwise directions, respectively. The direction of the magnetic

induction vector is chosen to be parallel to the downstream direction, i.e. B = (B, 0, 0). As was

mentioned above, such a ﬂow does not exhibit a direct coupling between the mean ﬂow and the

magnetic ﬁeld. Consequently, the direct eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld on the turbulent structure can

be revealed. In this case, equation (23) for the ﬂuid impulse vector p = (px, py, pz), is reduced to

Hence, the ﬂow under investigation is stable with respect to three-dimensional localized disturbances

only if the real part of λi is not positive. Therefore, for stability we require that

where N is a dimensionless interaction parameter which represents the ratio between the electro-

magnetic and the inertia forces.

The term ‘stability’ (and ‘instability’) here means that the ﬂuid impulse of a closed localized

(in all three directions) vortex disturbance will not grow (or grow) in time. The ﬂuid impulse is

a very suitable characteristic of localized vortex structures such as hairpin vortices in boundary

layers, since it combines the geometrical dimensions of the structure together with the magnitude

of its vorticity ﬁeld. As such, this stability deﬁnition cannot describe ‘wavy’ disturbances or ‘quasi’

two-dimensional structures for which the ﬂuid impulse integral is not deﬁned. It should be noted

however, that the above stability deﬁnition is not equivalent to the conventional criteria of linear

stability and energy stability. In fact, the growth of the ﬂuid impulse does not necessarily guaranty

growth in energy of the localized disturbance. For example, viscous diﬀusion leads to the decay of

the localized disturbance energy while its ﬂuid impulse remains the same.

As an example of the new stability criterion, the value of the interaction parameter required

for stability of Poiseuille ﬂow in a tube is σB2D/ρ ¯U
14.1, where D is the tube diameter and
¯U is the mean velocity. For ﬂow of mercury in a circular tube subjected to a strong longitudinal

≥

magnetic ﬁeld, Fraim & Heiser reported an increase of the critical Reynolds number for transition
from 2250 to 10350 when the magnetic induction B was increased from zero to 1.75weber/m2, and

the corresponding interaction parameter at the upper limit was 9. As can be seen in Fig. 10 of

their article, this value of the interaction parameter is an order of magnitude larger than the value

predicted by Stuart’s linear theory (Stuart, 1954). A direct comparison of these results with our

prediction is questionable because of at least two reasons. The ﬁrst is that the experimental mean

velocity proﬁles were not reported by Fraim & Heiser. The second is that the criterion presented

here is applicable only with respect to localized disturbances whereas transitional ﬂows include

various types of disturbances. Nevertheless, the predicted value of the interaction parameter found

in this paper is of the same order of magnitude as that of the experimental ones for large Reynolds

numbers.

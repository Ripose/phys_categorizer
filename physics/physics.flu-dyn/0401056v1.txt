Numerical and analytical studies of “ﬁnal states” of two-dimensional
(2D) decaying turbulence are reported. The ﬁrst part of this work is trying
to give a deﬁnition for ﬁnal states of 2D decaying turbulence. Although
the functional relation of ω
ψ is frequently used as the characterization
of those “ﬁnal states,” it is just a suﬃcient but not necessary condition so
it is not proper to be used as the deﬁnition. It is found the way through
the value of the eﬀective area S covered by the scatter ω
ψ plot, which is
initially suggested by Read [1], is more general, and more suitable for the
deﬁnition. Based on this concept, we gave out a deﬁnition that can cover
all existing results in late states of decaying 2D ﬂows, including some weird
double-valued ω
ψ scatter plots that can not be explained before. The rest
part of the paper is trying to further investigate 2D decaying turbulence with
the assistance of our new deﬁnition. Some new numerical results, which lead
to “bar” ﬁnal states and further verify the predictive ability of statistical
mechanics [2], are reported. It is realized that some simulations with narrow-
band energy spectral initial conditions, which can be called “turbulence”
doubtfully, lead to some ﬁnal states that can not be very well explained by
the statistical theory (in the meanwhile, they are still in the scope of our new
deﬁnition of the “ﬁnal state”). For those simulations with initial conditions
of broadband energy spectra that lead to the famous dipole, we give out a
mathematical re-interpreting for the so-called sin-hyperbolic (“sinh”) ω
ψ
scatter plot in ﬁnal states. We suggest the term “sinh” here should be
replaced by “sinh-like.” The corresponding physical meaning of this re-
interpreting will also be discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is an interesting topic to study ﬁnal states of two-dimensional decaying
turbulence. Recent publications [2] (hereafter YMC) and [3] show that nu-

merical simulations starting from diﬀerent initial conditions (depending on
the size of patches in the vorticity ﬁeld) can lead to diﬀerent ﬁnal states. The
statistical mechanics in two-dimensional turbulence, known as the “point”
theory and the “patch” theory, shows a great predictive power in this kind
of simulations.

The “point” theory is concerned with a mean-ﬁeld treatment of ideal
line vortices, which had been given thirty years ago [4, 5]. The system is
Hamiltonian with a ﬁnite phase space, applied by Boltzmann statistics to
its dynamics initially by Onsager [6]. It was further developed by several
groups [7-23].
In these investigations, it is surprise to see that the ideal
Euler mean-ﬁeld predictions ﬁt the Navier-Stokes results.

The “patch” theory started from the late 1980s [24-29]. In the “patch”
theory, the delta-functions that are used to discretize the vorticity ﬁeld in
the “point” theory are replaced by ﬁnite-area, mutually exclusive “patches”
of vorticity. The Lynden-Bell statistics [30] is applied to this theory.

The predictive abilities of these two theories are tested after deﬁning the
related entropy of them and developing the precise formulas suited for calcu-
lations, the details of which are given in Spring Notes by D.C. Montgomery
(private communication; see also a modiﬁed version of it in chapter 2 of [31]).
Several kinds of solutions in the double periodical domain from the statis-
tical mechanics are considered. It is found that the traditional “dipole” or
the one-dimensional “bar” solution will have the largest entropy under dif-
ferent conditions: for the vorticity ﬁeld with large patch vortices, the “bar”
solution is the maximum entropy state, and the “dipole” will dominate the
ﬁnal state if only point vortices or small patches exist initially. The predic-
tion is validated by most of our direct numerical simulations, which are well
represented by 13 simulations listed in [31]. These simulations, which make
use of Fourier pseudo-spectral methods, have considerable high resolutions
(5122) and have been run long enough (100 - 1500 turnover times) to make
sure to reach ﬁnal states. Those runs tested theoretical results through all
kinds of aspects: from maximum entropy states to local maximum states.
We even found a couple of results that lead to unclassiﬁed states, which are
excluded by the most general case of the “patch” theory (see section II and
III for some of them).

However, comparing to considerable eﬀorts to investigate the “ﬁnal state”
of 2D turbulence, few eﬀorts have been devoted to deﬁne it. There exist some
characters when the term of “ﬁnal states” in 2D ﬂows is referred to, but they
are rather blurred and it is very easy to ﬁnd some negative examples for them
as the investigation in this ﬁeld goes on.

For example, sometimes it is thought that the ﬂow ﬁeld has reached the

2

“ﬁnal state” if the pattern of the ﬂow remains unchanged for a certain long
time. However, in our sinh-Poisson quadrupole to “dipole” simulation (Figs.
7 in [3]), the quadrupole in the vorticity ﬁeld lasts so long (from t ∼= 0 to
t ∼= 150) that people might think the “ﬁnal state” has already been reached,
while the continued calculation showed that it is just a local maximum state.
There are still some other characters except the example above (we will
discuss another one in detail later in section IIA). Those characters are
important phenomena of “ﬁnal states.” In the meanwhile, they can be very
misleading. Thus it is necessary to give out a deﬁnition which can includes
all exiting cases of “ﬁnal states.”

This deﬁnition will play an important role when a long direct numer-
ical simulation of decaying turbulence is carried out.
It can be used to
decide when the code should be stopped. This is not a trivial decision since
some of the results (including the “bar” ﬁnal state) in YMC are obtained
partly because of the continuing calculation after former researchers stopped
[32] (of course, those runs are mainly stimulated by theoretical results of
the statistical-mechanics). In our former investigation, the pseudo-spectral
code has been continued as long as possible to make sure that ﬁnal states
have been reached. The calculation can be signiﬁcantly extended without
a good deﬁnition of the “ﬁnal state.” On the other hand, because of the
existing bottleneck in parallelization of the 2D pseudo-spectral code [3], the
extended calculation might mean several extra weeks (the wall clock time)
for runs with the resolution of 5122. The future investigation in this ﬁeld
may involve in simulations with the resolutions of 10242 or higher. For those
high-resolution simulations, even with the fastest parallel spectral Fourier
2D code we have so far (using the combined technique of domain decomposi-
tion and task distribution [33]), it would be a nightmare for the investigation
if no clue is used to judge the ﬁnal state and a lot of extended computation
is needed to make sure that there is no interesting new phenomenon any
more. In section II, we will try to give out a deﬁnition of “ﬁnal states” for
those kinds of purposes.

In section III, with the assistance of the new deﬁnition of “ﬁnal states,”
(on the other hand, in order to validate the deﬁnition), some numerical
simulations are carried out. This part of the work can be also treated as the
continued investigation of YMC. Former numerical results in YMC leading
to “bar” ﬁnal states are conﬁned by an initial symmetric quadrupole with
a certain mount of noise added to break the symmetry and accelerate the
process of computations. Without further proofs, it can be argued that the
“bar” is reached only because of the existing symmetry in the main structure.
Hence the generality of this kind of solutions might be endangered. In section

3

III, some other techniques are adopted to break the symmetry, and again
they end up with “bar” states. These simulations also conﬁrm our former
statement (in a much more direct sense): “it is the size of the ‘patch’ that
plays a key role in the process towards the ‘bar’ ﬁnal state.”

In section IIIB, another totally diﬀerent initial condition leading to the
“bar” will be reported. Although the statistical mechanics can predict the
ﬂow pattern for the ﬁnal state of that simulation (the patch size in the
initial vorticity ﬁeld is big, and thus the “bar” is expected [2]), it has some
diﬃculties when explaining the ω
ψ scatter plot at the late time. Here,
it should be noticed that that “ﬁnal state” is still in the scope of our new
deﬁnition in section IIB.

−

−

Section IV is concerned with an inﬂuential simulation in this ﬁeld [34-
36]. The question was raised when we tried to repeat the pioneers’ work -
changing the parameters of the sin-hyperbolic (sinh) function to make a best
ψ plot of the famous “dipole.” This ﬁtting process gave
ﬁt for the scatter ω
us the hallucination that the sum of several sinh functions is just another
sinh function. Of course, this is wrong, and the ﬁtting error can be reduced
dramatically by using the combination of several instead of just one sinh
function. The corresponding physical meaning of this ﬁtting process will
also be discussed. The main content of this section is more concerned with
the conception of the statistical mechanics than presenting new results: it
is suggested to replace the term “sinh” in existing literatures of this ﬁeld by
the term “sinh-like” to represent the “point” theory and numerical results
better.

There are mainly two threads when we are writing this paper: the ﬁrst
one is the new deﬁnition of “ﬁnal states,” another one is that this paper is
the extended work of YMC.

II. DEFINING THE “FINAL STATE” IN 2D TUR-
BULENCE

A. Starting from a suﬃcient but not necessary condition of
“ﬁnal states”

In 2D ﬂow ﬁeld, if we denote the vorticity as ω, and the stream function ψ,
the Navier-Stokes equation can be written as

with ν the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid.

A shorthand notation for the nonlinear contribution to Eq. (1) is the

Jacobian J(ω, ψ)

For inviscid ﬂows, Eq. (1) reduces to the Euler equation

J(ω, ψ) =

+ J(ω, ψ) = 0,

which states that the vorticity of a ﬂuid element is conserved for inviscid
ﬂows (note that Dω/Dt represents the material derivative).

It can be seen that if there exists a functional relation ω = f (ψ), then

J(ω, ψ) =

∂f (ψ)

∂f (ψ)

This means that the experimental or numerical observation of the func-
tional relationship ω = f (ψ) indicates the presence of a stationary state of
inviscid ﬂow. Usually, this observation is treated as an indication of the
presence of a nearly steady state of high Reynolds number ﬂows, i.e., the
case when ν

ψ functional relation is an important tool in the char-
acterization of so-called “ﬁnal states” of decaying 2D turbulence, we should
notice that it is a suﬃcient but not necessary condition of near-equilibrium
states of high Reynolds number ﬂows.

In Figs. 1, we see a good example of the functional relationship between
ω and ψ - the famous Lamb dipole (for further details see [37, 38]). It has
the linear relation of ω

the sinh relationship [34-36], of which we will give a re-interpreting as the
“sinh-like” relation in section IV.

In Figs. 2, we see a double-valued structure of the ω

ψ plot [39] and the
associated ω and ψ contour plots. They come from one simulation in YMC
- Figs. 18 and 19, which cannot be explained by the existing statistical-
ψ scatter plot with the contour
mechanical theories. By comparing the ω
plots of the vorticity and the stream function, we can conclude that the
larger negative vortex, which is indicated by the solid arrow, corresponds to

The vorticity ﬁeld shown in Fig. 2(a) represents a stationary solution
of the Euler equation Dω/Dt = 0. This can be demonstrated numerically:
what we did is using the pseudo-spectral Fourier code of the Navier-Stokes
equation and setting ν = 0 (this is the handiest way to test it in our case);
the exact vorticity ﬁeld of Fig. 2(a) (without any noise) is used as the initial
condition for a simulation with the resolution of 5122. The simulation lasts
105 time steps (the time step is 1/2000), which is about 400 turnover
for 3
times if we set ν = 1/5000. However, the vorticity ﬁeld has not been changed
a bit from t = 0 to t = 150. The continuing running of the code is more a
test of the accuracy of the pseudo-spectral method than anything else.

This double-valued structure cannot be explained by the statistical-
mechanical theory for Euler ﬂows, even if the most general formulation of
the “patch” theory

is taken into consideration.

At this point, we should admit that although the application of a statistical-

mechanical approach to predict the quasi-stationary ﬁnal state of inviscid
ﬂows appears to be very powerful to investigate freely evolving 2D turbulent
ﬂows, it still has some limitations, which cannot be easily understood.

The ﬂow is not described by any functional relation between ω and ψ,
but it manages to go to one speciﬁc kind of equilibrium states. This is partly
due to the fact that this simulation starts from a condition with narrow-band
energy spectra - more speciﬁcally, most of the energy is concentrated in few
low wave numbers. Because of inverse energy cascade phenomena in 2D
turbulence (the energy is mainly transferred to lower wave numbers), the
state of broad-band energy spectra, where the statistical mechanics might
take eﬀect, can never be reached.

Anyway, the functional relation of ω

ψ is not enough to deﬁne the
“ﬁnal state,” we need something else to be used as the deﬁnition. And this
will be the main task in the following subsection.

−

B. A deﬁnition covering all existing possibilities

To estimate the quantitative ﬂux across the region, people normally use a
diagnostic technique ﬁrst described by Read et al.
[1]. They showed that
the net ﬂux of vorticity out of a closed loop in the physical space is equal to
the eﬀective area enclosed by the corresponding circuit in the ω
ψ space.
However, the usage of the eﬀective area so far is limited to indicate how far
ψ functional relation the ﬂow ﬁeld is [40, 41].
away from the state of the ω
In the following, we will show that it is in fact a more powerful and more
general judgment for equilibrium states of 2D turbulence than the simple
ω

ψ functional relation.
For the integrality of this paper, this judgment will be re-stated as fol-

−

−

−

lows:

•

At a certain stage of a numerical simulation of 2D decaying turbulence,
draw a closed circuit in the contour plot of ψ that can represent the
whole ﬂow ﬁeld, ﬁnd enough points on this circuit and mark them in
order. In Fig. 3(a), we only use 5 points for convenience.

•

Find the corresponding points in the scatter plot of ω
time of the simulation. There will be two kinds of possibilities:

−

ψ at the same

1. Those points form a simple circuit, the area of which is equal to

the eﬀective area S (Fig. 3(b)).

2. Those points form a region that is reentrant. The eﬀective area S
in this case is equal to the sum of anticlockwise areas minus the
sum of clockwise areas. For example, in Fig. 3(c), the eﬀective
area S is

S = Santiclockwise

Sclockwise = S1

S2.

(7)

−

−

(In Fig. 3(c), we only draw one clockwise and one anticlockwise
region for convenience.
In a real problem, it may have several
clockwise and anticlockwise areas respectively.)

•

The absolute value of S indicates how far away the ﬂow ﬁeld is from the
equilibrium state. The larger the absolute value of S, the further away
the ﬂow ﬁeld from the ﬁnal state. On the other hand, if the absolute
value of S is very small (S ∼= 0), it means that the equilibrium state
has been reached.

7

•

The condition of S ∼= 0 is only enough to judge the equilibrium state
of 2D turbulence. To deﬁne the “ﬁnal state,” it is necessary to re-
move those local maximum states (see for examples in section IIIB2
of YMC).

To sum up, the “ﬁnal state” of 2D turbulence can be deﬁned as:
The ﬂow ﬁeld of 2D turbulence has reached the “ﬁnal state” if the fol-

lowing two conditions are true:

•

The eﬀective area S ∼= 0;
It is not a local maximum state.

•
Note that the “real” ﬁnal state of the ﬂow ﬁeld is the zero vorticity state
(ω
0) when the decaying process really stops. But those cases are not
interesting to us. The “ﬁnal state” that we are talking about is actually a
stage when the continuing numerical simulation will not lead to any new
interesting phenomenon.

≡

Here, the condition of S ∼= 0 cannot be strictly deﬁned. How small
the absolute value of S should be depends on diﬀerent speciﬁc conditions.
According to our experience, it is more useful to look into the scatter plot
of ω

ψ itself than to give out any speciﬁc value.

−
In the following, we will use the new deﬁnition to analyze diﬀerent situ-

ations:

•

•

For those results with the functional relation of ω
ψ such as the lamb
dipole or the “sinh-like” relation discussed in the previous subsection,
it is obvious that S ∼= 0 - the “ﬁnal state” has been reached.
For those results with multi-valued structures in ω
three kinds of situations:

ψ plots, there are

−

−

1. If that multi-valued structure does not close any area (S ∼= 0),
such as Fig. 2(c), it can be also said that the ﬁnal state has been
reached. (Actually Fig. 2(c) is not a good example:
if we put
some noise onto the weird quadrupole, and use it as the initial
condition of a DNS run, we will end up with a normal sense of
the ω
ψ functional relation. So actually this weird quadrupole
is just a local maximum state. However, we have to make the
deﬁnition be able to sort out similar situations with maximum
entropies, which might appear in the future research.)

−

8

2. If that multi-valued structure does close some areas, but they are
arranged clockwise and anticlockwise, and can cancel each other
(again, S ∼= 0). We can also say that the “ﬁnal state” has been
reached. (We will show an example in section IIIB.)

3. If that multi-valued structure closes some areas, but clockwise
and anticlockwise parts of them cannot cancel each other, then
the ﬁnal state has not been reached, and continuing calculations
are needed. An extreme example is a state when the scatter
points of ω
ψ are distributed across the whole plot, which nor-
mally happens when the simulation was started using some ran-
dom initial condition.
With this judgment, we can easily sort out those non-equilibrium
states such as the traveling wave in the patch quadrupole to the
“bar” simulation (Figs. 4).

−

III. FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS ON THE “BAR”
FINAL STATE

In YMC, we have investigated the emergence of the “bar” ﬁnal state by
considering an antisymmetric basic ﬂow (the quadrupole solution) with a
considerable amount of noise added to it in order to break the symmetry of
the basic ﬂow. We decided to devote some more eﬀorts to ﬁnd other initial
conditions leading to the “bar” quasi-stationary ﬁnal state, and it will be
seen shortly that the appearance of the “bar” ﬁnal state is not that accidental
as might erroneously be concluded from the previous set of simulations.

The simulations are ﬁnished by the dynamical pseudo-spectral-code of
the 2D NS equation, using a resolution of 512
512 Fourier modes. The
time step in all simulations is ﬁxed at 1/2000 and determined by the CFL
condition. The initial energy, using the normalization of

×

E =

1

1
2

(2π)2 ZZ

ωψ dxdy

is 0.5. There is no hyperviscosity or small-scale smoothing of any kind in
our simulations.

A. Simulations by shrinking the size of “patches” in the initial
ﬁeld

The ﬁrst idea here is to start from the same quadrupolar “patch” initial
condition as YMC, but distort the initial condition slightly in the follow-

9

ing way: we shrink the patch size with a small amount and reposition the
patches slightly (see, for example, the plots in the ﬁrst row of Figs. 5). The
symmetry of the basic ﬂow has been broken already, and there is no need to
add any noise to it (unlike what we did in Fig. 7(b) of YMC). The Reynolds
number is ﬁxed at 1/ν = 8000. As can be seen from Figs. 5, we have
performed two simulations with two diﬀerent distorted quadrupolar initial
conditions, with the patch size reduced by a factor of 7/8
7/8 = 49/64
compared to the patch size of the original quadrupole initial condition (see
Fig. 7(a) in YMC), and both runs clearly reveal the emergence of the quasi-
stationary “bar” ﬁnal state. A similar set of simulations has been carried
out, but now with the patch size even further reduced. In Figs. 6, we have
shown the vorticity contour plots of runs with the patch size reduced by a
factor of 3/4
3/4 = 9/16, and it is clear that no “bar” ﬁnal state is found
in this case.

×

×

We may recall that in Figs. 4 of YMC, the E-S plot predicts that for
doubly-periodical domain, large “patch” vortices lead to the “bar” quasi-
stationary ﬁnal state and small “patch” vortices lead to the “dipole” ﬁnal
state. In YMC, we only test two extreme cases of theoretical results – the
initial quadrupole solutions with the largest patches (Figs. 7-10 in YMC)
and the smallest patches - “point” (Figs. 14-16 in YMC). There is no in-
termediate simulation that can make the logic more complete. The four
simulations in Figs. 5,6 provide a much more direct proof for our theoreti-
cal results of the statistical-mechanics. We can predict that if the size of the
patch is shrunk further (by a factor even smaller than 9/16), the numerical
simulation will lead to the dipole ﬁnal state.

One question that might be raised concerns the direction of the “bar”
ﬁnal state. As can be observed in Figs. 5, it can happen in the horizontal
or vertical direction (and should occur with equal probability due to their
symmetrical equivalence). However, the “bar” ﬁnal state (with 2π periodic-
ity perpendicular to the ﬂow direction) has never been observed in any other
direction due to lack of periodicity of such a solution. Note that a solution
with periodicity less than 2π perpendicular to the ﬂow direction enables a
ﬂow rotated with respect to the x and y direction (e.g., a direction of 45◦ is
needed for a bar solution with a √2π- periodicity).

Due to the inverse energy cascade phenomenon in 2D turbulence, most
of the energy will be concentrated on the lowest modes of wavenumber at
ﬁnal states - there are four modes altogether:

~k = (kx, ky) = (1, 0), (

1, 0), (0, 1) or (0,

1).

−

Diﬀerent combinations of these four modes dominate ﬂow patterns at

−

10

ﬁnal states. Here are three kinds of possibilities altogether:

•

•

•

If energies are more or less equally distributed in these four modes,
we will get the dipole (see the last vorticity contour plot in Figs. 5 of
YMC);

If energies are concentrated on either (1,0), (-1,0) or (0,1), (0, -1), then
we will get “bar” ﬁnal states (like Figs. 5);

If energies are distributed on those modes unequally, then we will get
a ﬁnal state between “dipole” and “bar” (like Figs. 6, especially Figs.
6(b)).

B. The “slanting bar” to “bar” simulation

We have conducted another set of simulations with initial conditions that
was found to lead to the “bar” ﬁnal state. The initial condition is based
on the slanting bar solution already referred to in the previous subsection
(√2π-periodicity), where a certain amount of noise is added to it to break
the symmetry. We let the ﬂow evolve and as shown in Figs. 7, the “bar” ﬁnal
solution is obtained eventually. The Reynolds number in this simulation is
ﬁxed at 1/ν = 8000. The initial Taylor-scale Reynolds number

It increases to 8035 at the end of the simulation. Attention should be
ψ scatter plot obtained at the end of the simulation. It is
drawn to the ω
similar to the scatter plot obtained for the “bar” solution in Fig. 9 of YMC,
but some subtle diﬀerences can be observed. When considered in more
details, the scatter plot is in fact a double-valued structure. However, this
double-valued structure is diﬀerent from the open line in Fig. 2(c). It is a
structure that actually encloses some areas. We maybe recall the discussion
in the previous section that if those areas cannot cancel each other, namely
= 0, it may mean that the “ﬁnal state” has not been reached and the
S
continuing calculation is needed.

However, with a close examine of the ω

ψ scatter plot, we will ﬁnd that

the region covered by scatter points is actually reentrant, and thus S

0:

−

≈

This procedure can be done by drawing a line from the bot-
tom to the top of the contour plot of ψ (see the arrow line at the
last ﬁgure in the right column of Figs. 7). It is not necessary

11

6
to draw a loop (like what we did in Fig. 3(a)) in this case, be-
cause we are dealing with the doubly-periodical condition, and
a straight line that connects two opposite boundaries is already
enough to make a loop. At the late stage of this simulation, the
ﬂow ﬁeld is essentially one-dimensional. It is possible to gather
all the information by studying this straight line. As indicated in
Fig. 8, the corresponding points in ω
ψ plot form a clockwise
region and an anticlockwise region, which can almost cancel each
other (see Eq. (7)). So in fact, the absolute value of the eﬀective
area S is very small - the “ﬁnal state” has been reached.

−

This simulation illustrates one special case that our new “ﬁnal state”

deﬁnition covers (see the second last paragraph in section IIB).

Again, the statistical mechanics cannot explain this double-valued struc-

ture due to the less “turbulent” initial condition.

IV. A RE-INTERPRETING FOR THE ω
OF THE FAMOUS DIPOLE

−

ψ PLOT

About a decade ago, Matthaeus et al.
[34-36] reported the ﬁrst long time
simulation which led to the “dipole” ﬁnal state. They used the sinh function
ψ plot at the late time [36] for the ﬁrst time, and they
to ﬁt the scatter ω
found a close ﬁtting function by changing the values of α and β in

−

ω = α sinh(βψ).

(8)

However, we will argue that it is not enough to use only one single sinh
function, more sinh functions should be adopted to ﬁt the scatter plot. The
ﬁrst subsection will tell people a fake theorem, which is the reason why the
pioneer works are restricted themselves to one sinh function. The second
subsection will be our re-interpreting of the ω

ψ plot.

A. Starting from a fake theorem

The fake theorem states as follows:

If the theorem above is true, we can easily get a more general conclusion

from it:

which make the following equation true:

Figs. 9(b, c) look so much like a sinh function that they give us the feeling
that we can always ﬁnd a good combination of the parameters α0, β0, which
makes the simple sinh function (α0 sinh(β0x)) ﬁt any of those ﬁgures (as
what Eq. (10) indicated).

We have drawn the plot of y =

αi sinh(βix) with other diﬀerent values

of n, αi, and βi, it always looks like a single sinh function.

Of course, Eqs. (9) and (10) are not true. They can be easily disproved
after comparing the ﬁrst few coeﬃcients of the Taylor series in both sides of
the equal mark.

B. “Sinh” or “sinh-like”?

Partly misled by the same mistake we made in the fake theorem above, the
ψ plot of
former researchers restricted their eﬀorts to ﬁt the scatter ω
“dipole” by using only one sinh function, which corresponds to two kinds of
particles in the “point” theory. In this subsection, it will be seen that we
can get a better ﬁtting function if more particles are adopted.

−

Before making any comparison of two ﬁtting methods, it is necessary to
deﬁne an indicator of the ﬁtting degree. There are many choices to do that,
and the correlation factor is adopted here

where f is the function used to ﬁt the curve, and ¯ωi is the space average
of ω. The larger R2 is, the better ﬁtting function f we will obtain (the
maximum value of R2 is 1).

−

The scatter ω

ψ plot to ﬁt is from Fig. 6 of YMC, which is essentially
a reproduction of the result of Matthaeus et al. [34-36]. As it can be seen
in Fig. 10(a), if only two kinds of particles are adopted (the ﬁtting function
is limited to one sinh function), there will be some part of the ﬁtting line
running away from the scatter plot (indicated by the circle). With four
kinds of particles (Fig. 10(b)), a much better ﬁt is obtained. Of course, the
more particles are adopted, the better ﬁtting function we will obtain.

Note that in Fig. 10(b), two more unequal strength particles - e1.07x and
e−1.27x instead of two equal ones (or, another sinh function) are introduced.
This is because the asymmetry exists in the ω
ψ plot; the unequal strength
particles make the ﬁtting better than the sinh functions. Pointin et al. use
the similar technique in their research before [9], but they also only use two
kinds of particles.

−

For the physical meaning of this ﬁtting process, it is the same problem

as the following question:

ﬁeld?

How many kinds of vortices are enough to represent the real vorticity

Of course, the more kinds of vortices are adopted, the better.
The discussion above gives out the explanation why sinh-like plots (we
know they are not necessary sinh functions anymore) are observed so often
in the late time of numerical simulations of 2D decaying turbulence:

ψ relations, the
In the patch theory, there are millions of ω
−
general form of which is illustrated in Eq. (6).
If sizes of all
the patches are shrunk to point, we will always obtain sinh-like
plots. Those sinh-like plots do not follow the same formula, but
they look the same.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we try to give out a deﬁnition of the “ﬁnal state” of 2D
decaying turbulence. Our new deﬁnition, which makes use of the eﬀective

14

area S in the ω
relation, and can cover all existing results.

−

ψ space, is more general than the ordinary functional

We found some new DNS results that can further conﬁrm the predictive
power of the statistical mechanics. It is realized that existing numerical re-
sults that verify the “patch” theory are those runs starting from narrow-band
low wavenumber initial conditions. On the other hand, such less “turbulent”
initial conditions tend to lead to “patch” favor results or some weird states
that no existing statistical mechanics can explain.

We also found the term “sinh,” which is frequently used in existing
literatures of 2D turbulence research, should be replaced by “sinh-like.” It
is actually very natural to do that, because the more kinds of particles
are used to represent the vorticity ﬁeld, the more accurate results will be
obtained.

Finally, for the integrality of investigations about the “patch” and “point”
theory in the statistical mechanics, we should not only connect the statis-
tical theory with numerical simulations (in YMC and this paper), but also
connect the theory with experiments:

•

•

For the “patch” theory, so far as to our knowledge, there is no exper-
iment setup that can generate ﬂat vortices, which are illustrated in
our numerical simulations. It would be interesting to see such kind of
experiments in the future.

For the “point” theory, it is more easily to generate random point
vortices in the laboratory, but our numerical code and theory results
are only dealing with double periodical boundary condition for the
time being. It is easier to archive high resolutions and perform high
Reynolds number simulations by doing this, but it is also diﬃcult to
ﬁnd any experimental comparison. The next step of this research will
try to connect the theory with more complex boundaries - for example,
the no-slip boundary, which can easily ﬁnd some laboratory proofs.

Figure 7: Contours of constant vorticity (left column) and constant stream
function (right column) at three diﬀerent times for the run with a new initial
condition leading to the “bar” ﬁnal state. The arrow line in the last ﬁgure
of the right column is used to mark the ﬂow ﬁeld, and calculate the eﬀective
area in Fig. 8.

Figure 8: The ω
ψ scatter plot for the run shown in Figs. 7. The two ends
of the plot are actually two loops. The two arrows indicate the orientations
of these two loops, which are obtained by ﬁnding the corresponding points
along the arrow line in the last plot of Figs. 7.

Figure 9: (a) is the plot of one simple sinh function (see Eq. (11)). (b) and
(c) are plots of two sums of 100 sinh functions (see Eq. (12) and Eq. (13));
they all look like simple sinh functions.

Figure 10: Diﬀerent functions (indicated by curves drawn through the plot-
ted points) are used to ﬁt the same ω
ψ scatter plot of the “dipole” ﬁnal
state. (a) The ﬁtting function is y = 0.13sinh(2.16x), the correlation factor
is R2 = 0.95. (b) The ﬁtting function is y = 0.73sinh(1.71x)

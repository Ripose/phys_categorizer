Instability of a moving contact line

We study a solid plate plunging into or being withdrawn from a liquid bath, to

highlight the fundamental diﬀerence between the local behavior of an advancing or

a receding contact line, respectively. It is assumed that the liquid partially wets the

solid, making a ﬁnite contact angle in equilibrium. In our hydrodynamic description

which neglects the presence of the outer gas atmosphere, an advancing dynamic

wetting line persists to arbitrarily high speeds. The receding wetting line, on the

other hand, vanishes at a critical speed set by the competition between viscous and

surface tension forces. In the advancing case, we apply existing matching techniques

to the plunging plate geometry, to signiﬁcantly improve on existing theories. For the

receding contact line, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time how the local contact line

solution can be matched to the far-ﬁeld meniscus. In doing so, we conﬁrm our very

recent criterion for the instability of the receding contact line. The results of both

the advancing and the receding cases are tested against simulations of the full model

equations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A number of recent experiments [1, 2, 3, 4] have tested the stability of forced advancing

and receding contact lines under conditions of partial wetting. For example, if a solid plate

or ﬁber is plunging into a liquid bath to be coated (advancing contact line), the speed can

be quite high (m/s) [4], while maintaining a stationary contact line. In the opposite case of

withdrawal (receding contact line) [2], a stationary contact line is observed only for very low

speeds, and a macroscopic ﬁlm is deposited [2, 5] typically at a speed of only a few cm/s.

The description of a moving contact line is complicated by the fact that the Navier-

Stokes equation with standard no-slip boundary conditions [6] breaks down near it, because

FIG. 1: A schematic of the setup: a plate is being withdrawn at an angle θ on the right, and

being pushed into the ﬂuid on the left. Only the ﬂow to the left of the plate is considered, which

is assumed long enough for the coupling to the other side to be ignored. At the contact line
the microscopic slope of the interface is h′(0) = θe. Since the interface is highly curved, this

microscopic contact angle is only observed on a scale of nanometers (expanded region on the left).

The depression of the advancing contact line (left) relative to the level of the liquid bath is ∆. The

contact line is stable at any speed, while for the receding contact line (right) there exists a critical

speed Uc above which the contact line vanishes. Instead, the plate is covered by a thin ﬁlm.

such a hypothetical ﬂow would produce an inﬁnite energy dissipation [7].

Instead, some

microscopic length scale λ must be invoked that cuts oﬀ this singularity, which in this paper

we are going to take as a slip length. As a result, the local ﬂow near the contact line is

characterized by a typical length of about a nanometer [8], which has to be matched [9]

to the macroscopic ﬂow away from the solid. In this paper, we apply a matching method

developed for spreading drops [10] to the plunging plate, and test the result by comparing

to numerical simulations. This very signiﬁcantly improves the results of earlier calculations

for the same problem [11, 12]. For the opposite case of a receding contact angle we ﬁnd that

a new matching procedure is needed. The results conﬁrm our very recent criterion [13] for

the instability of a receding contact line.

Figure 1 illustrates the geometry to be considered in the present paper. On the left, a

3

solid plate is pushed into a pool of viscous liquid. As a result, the interface deforms and

the contact line is pushed downward relative to its equilibrium position. Within the present

model, this advancing contact line is stable at any speed. If the plate is withdrawn from

the bath, ﬂuid is pulled up with the plate, and a new contact line position is established.

However, this state is realizable only at speeds below a critical speed Uc. For U > Uc

the contact line is no longer sustainable and continues to move up the plate [14]. In the

stationary state, the plate is covered by a thin ﬁlm, ﬁrst described by Landau, Levich, and

Derjaguin (LLD) [15, 16]. To understand the fundamental diﬀerence between pushing a

plate and pulling it out, one has to consider the matching between the region very close to

the contact line, and the capillary proﬁle away from it. Qualitatively, the diﬀerence in the

behavior of the advancing and of the receding contact line makes sense: if the plate is pushed

into the liquid, the interface is bent away from the solid, and viscous forces are reduced.

If the plate is pulled, the interface is pulled toward the solid, making the ﬁlm thinner and

enhancing viscous eﬀects. Hence in the latter case there is a positive feedback increasing

viscous forcing and thus leading to instability.

The strong energy dissipation near a moving contact line results from the fact that viscous

forces become very large as the thickness of the liquid ﬁlm goes to zero [7]. As a result of

the interplay between viscous and surface tension forces, the interface is highly curved, and

the contact line speed U is properly measured by the capillary number Ca = Uη/γ, where

η is the viscosity of the ﬂuid and γ the surface tension between ﬂuid and gas. Owing to

this bending the interface angle measured at, say, 100µm away from the contact line diﬀers

[17, 18, 19, 20] signiﬁcantly from the microscopic angle directly at the contact line.

The existence of a slip length λ, which is of the order of a few molecular diameters under

normal circumstances [21, 22, 23], implies a convenient separation of length scales between

two diﬀerent parts of the surface proﬁle. On one hand, there is a contact line region whose

typical scale is λ, on the other hand there is an “outer” meniscus region, whose typical

length scale is set by the capillary length ℓc =

γ/(ρg). Thus one expects the local “inner”

behavior of the proﬁle near the contact line to be of the form

since λ is the only available length scale. The dependence on the equilibrium contact angle

Firstly, one ﬁnds from (1) that the curvature of the interface is h′′(x) = θ2

Thus the matching condition is

which ensures that the inner and the outer solutions are compatible. We will see that (2)

needs to be supplemented by what is essentially a condition for the slope.

The matching condition (2) is the key to understanding wetting behavior. Let us sum-

marize the main results of this paper by analyzing the solution qualitatively for the two

cases of an advancing contact angle (plate plunging into the ﬂuid) and of a receding contact
angle (plate being withdrawn). For very small λ, it is clear that H ′′(

∞

the inner problem. We will see that for an advancing contact angle this boundary condition

yields the inner scaling function H(ξ), ﬁrst found by Voinov [24]. The matching to Voinov’s

solution is slightly complicated by the presence of logarithmic terms in the slope [10].

On the other hand, Voinov’s solution cannot be applied to the case of a receding contact

line. Rather, all inner solutions maintain a ﬁnite curvature H ′′(

) > 0. This means that

at too small a value of λ the matching condition (2) can no longer be obeyed and the inner

and the outer solutions are incompatible. As a result, the contact line vanishes. In a typical

experiment, λ is constant and the speed is increased, but the eﬀect is the same: since the
curvature of the interface is caused by viscous forces [7], H ′′(

) increases with speed and

matching becomes impossible. This explains the phenomenology described in Fig.1 above.

∞

∞

The impossibility of matching a receding contact line above a critical capillary number was

already noticed in [25], based on numerical integration of the thin-ﬁlm equations. Analytical

solutions for the inner solution will permit us to give a much more complete description.

In the next section we will introduce the hydrodynamic equations to be used for the cal-

culation of stationary proﬁles. We will conﬁne ourselves to the “lubrication approximation”,

valid in the limit that the liquid ﬁlm is thin. In the following section we consider the case of

a solid plate being pushed into the liquid (advancing contact angle). By matching an inner

5

to an outer solution, we compute the proﬁle as a function of speed. In the fourth section we

introduce the matching procedure for the opposite case of a plate being withdrawn (receding

contact angle). The failure of this matching procedure gives the critical capillary number

at which the contact line can no longer exist, in agreement with our earlier result [13]. For

speeds below the critical value we again ﬁnd the interface proﬁle. All our analytical results

are tested by comparison with numerical solutions of the original equations. Finally, we

summarize our results and indicate directions of future research.

II. LUBRICATION DESCRIPTION

As illustrated in Fig.1, we are considering a plate being pushed into or being withdrawn

from a liquid bath at an angle θ. This means we have to solve the steady Navier-Stokes

equation with a free surface, and no-slip boundary conditions on the plate. Since the plate

is moving with speed U, the contact line between ﬂuid, solid, and gas is moving relative to

the solid. As explained above, the Navier-Stokes equation does not allow such a solution,

and a small-scale cutoﬀ has to be introduced at the contact line [17, 18]. The dominant

mechanism responsible for cutoﬀ depends on the particular system under study [18, 26]. As

a representative example, we assume that the corner singularity is relieved by allowing the

ﬂuid to slip across the solid surface, since the matching to the slip region of size λ is well

understood in this case [10]. According to the Navier slip law [7], the ﬂuid speed relative to

the solid is proportional to the shear rate:

u(x, 0)

U = λ

at

y = 0.

∂u
∂y

(3)

Recently, we found [27] that various modiﬁcations of (3) have a minimal inﬂuence on the

interface away from the contact line. Hence we do not believe that the particular cutoﬀ

mechanism used is of great importance.

A much thornier issue is the slope h′(0) of the ﬂuid layer to be speciﬁed at the contact

line. It is well appreciated that molecular processes are involved [28, 29], which are beyond

a hydrodynamic description. This will lead to a an eﬀective speed dependence of the contact

angle as deﬁned on a scale of nanometers. The importance of these microscopic eﬀects

relative to hydrodynamic ones is determined by the amount of energy dissipation involved

in either process [30]. Thus for high viscosities the speed dependence of the microscopic

6

(4)

angle can most likely be ignored, in agreement with experimental data [31]. If there is no

“intrinsic” speed dependence of the microscopic angle, it must coincide with its equilibrium
value θe at zero speed. We thus take h′(0) = θe.

The mathematical problem simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly if we assume that the angle the inter-

face makes with the solid is always small, and that viscosity is suﬃciently large for inertia

to be ignored. In this limit, one can ﬁnd an approximate description of the hydrodynamic

equations which eliminates the ﬂow ﬁeld [10, 14], and the so-called “lubrication equation”

can be written entirely in terms of the free-surface proﬁle h(x). Non-dimensionalizing all

lengths with the capillary length ℓc =

γ/(ρg) one ﬁnds [14]

≈

clearly between advancing and receding contact lines we always take Ca as a positive quan-

tity, and rather change the sign in the equation. The - sign corresponds to the plate plunging

into the liquid, the + sign to the opposite case of the plate being withdrawn.

Viscous forces appear on the left of (4) (proportional to the speed), and diverge quadrat-

ically as h goes to zero at the contact line. As a result, viscous dissipation would diverge

if it were not for the presence of slip, which weakens the singularity. Near the contact line

the surface is highly curved, so the ﬁrst term on the right of (4), which comes from surface

tension, balances the viscous term on the left. The other two terms stem from gravity and

only come into play at greater distances from the contact line. The ﬁlm thickness vanishes
at the contact line, where the slope is h′(0) = θe as discussed above. Far away from the plate
the surface coincides with the liquid bath, so the third boundary condition is h′(

) = θ.

∞

Rescaling the layer thickness h with the equilibrium contact angle θe, one ﬁnds that there

remain three parameters in the problem, namely the combinations Ca/θ3

e , λ/θe, and θ/θe.

However, we ﬁnd it more intuitive to keep the original parameters, and to state results in

terms of the above combinations if convenient.

III. PUSHING

We begin by considering a plate being pushed into a viscous ﬂuid, corresponding to the

- sign in (4).

In the spirit of the matching condition (2) we approach this problem by

7

(9)

ﬁrst considering the leading-order behavior near the contact line, where h goes to zero. As

discussed above, this equation [10] is

3Ca
h2 + 3λh

−

= h′′′,

which we studied in detail in [27] for a more general class of slip models. The characteristic

scale of the local solution is the slip length λ, so it is convenient to introduce the scaled

variables (1), which leads to

δ

where δ = 3Ca/θ3

As argued above, the matching condition (2) leads to the requirement that the curvature

H ′′(ξ) vanishes for large ξ as the limit λ

0 is performed. This means that the boundary

conditions for the solution of (6) are

→

H(0) = 0, H ′(0) = 1, H ′′(

) = 0.

∞

The only parameter now appearing in the problem is the rescaled capillary number δ, and

equations (6)-(7) uniquely specify the proﬁle close to the contact line.

This inner solution can be found by expanding in a power series in the capillary number
in a manner described in many papers [10, 27, 32]. If one writes the solution in terms of h′3,

its behavior for large x/λ can be written as

h′3
in(x)

−

θ3
e = 9Ca ln(x/L)

to any order in the capillary number [27]. This is the form originally proposed by Voinov

[24], using more qualitative arguments. The length L appearing inside the logarithm can be

computed as a power series in the capillary number:

(cid:21)

but for simplicity we only take the leading order term into account here, as corrections

introduced by the next order are usually quite small [27].

The crucial point of representing the inner solution in the form (8) is that the only

parameter multiplying ln(x) is the capillary number, which is deﬁned in terms of the “outer”

problem. Namely, the outer problem (8) needs to be matched to is

line hout(0) = 0, making it impossible to impose a slope. Instead, we are seeking a solution

where F is a constant to be computed. As demonstrated in [10], this can be achieved by

expanding the outer solution in a power series in Ca:

hout(x) = h0(x) + Cah1(x) + O(Ca2).

The equation for h0, representing a balance of surface tension and gravity, is

h′′′

Equation (13) has the following family of solutions, which are ﬁnite at inﬁnity and which

vanish at the contact line:

h0(x) = θx + (θ

θap)(e−x

1).

−

−

The slope h′

out(0) = θap of (14) at the contact line is called the “apparent” contact angle and

is a free parameter still to be determined by the matching procedure. Its name is motivated

by the fact that a macroscopic measurement of the proﬁle on the scale ℓc will yield a proﬁle

close to (14). If extrapolated to the contact line, the angle will appear to be θap, rather than

the true microscopic value θe. Obviously, (14) cannot be matched directly to the contact

line solution (8), which contains a logarithm. This logarithmic dependence will come out of

the next-order solution h1, whose equation reads

giving the ﬁrst condition h1(0) = 0. To compute h1(0), we observe that the second integrand

Next we ﬁnd a condition at inﬁnity by noting that

h(x) = θx + ∆ + O(1/x),

(18)

where ∆ is vertical distance of the contact line from the undisturbed surface. Since we want

h0 to represent the far-ﬁeld behavior of the proﬁle, we put h1(

We are now in the position to match the inner solution of (24), which has the form (1),

to an appropriate outer solution, following the prescription (2) given in the introduction. To

achieve this matching it is enough to consider hout(x) = h0(x) as given by (14), since (28)

does not contain any logarithmic term. For x/λ

θap goes to zero. Physical solutions cannot exist for capillary numbers beyond that, since the
outer solution only makes physical sense for θap ≥
simpler equation for the critical capillary number Cacr at which the contact line disappears,

0. Following [13], we now derive a much

and show that it is equivalent to θap = 0.

Since θap ≥

0, the maximum value of the left hand side of (35b), which is the curvature

of the outer solution, is θ. The right hand side, corresponding to the curvature of the inner

solution, is on the other hand bounded from below. From (28) it is seen that the minimum

curvature corresponds to the condition that Ai(s1) must be maximal among solutions of

its global maximum 0.53566 . . . , which occurs for s = smax =

βBi(smax)/Ai(smax) we can in fact ensure that Ai assumes

Now by equating the maximum value of the left hand side of (35b) with the minimum

.

But at the capillary number given by (39), the ﬁrst matching condition (35a) is also satisﬁed
identically, since θap = by = 0. This is because Ai is extremal, so Ai′ = 0. Thus Cacr as

given by (39) gives exactly the critical capillary number corresponding to θap = 0 in Fig.4.

This conﬁrms a classical conjecture by Derjaguin and Levi [35], later reiterated by others

[36], that the transition to a ﬁlm is characterized by the apparent contact angle going to

zero. This criterion was conﬁrmed experimentally in [2], using ﬁbers being pulled out of a

viscous liquid.

The concept underlying equation (39) for the critical capillary number is illustrated again

in Fig.5. Below the critical capillary number, there is some overlap in the curvature of the

inner and the outer solutions (left diagram in Fig.5). The matching equation (36) determines

which solution is selected from this overlap region. Above the critical capillary number,

there can be no solution (right diagram in Fig.5): there is no outer solution which could be

matched to an inner solution, because this would result in a sudden jump in the curvature.

In Fig. 6 we show the result of a numerical integration of (4) at the critical capillary,

and compare it to the inner and outer solutions (33). The critical capillary number was

found numerically by raising Ca until no more solutions of (4) could be found. For large

ξ, the slope of the outer solution (33a) agrees with the numerical solution, but extrapolates
to h′ = 0 at the contact line, as reqired by θap = 0. Coming from the interior, the inner

solution (33b) agrees with the full solution up to the turning point.

To obtain a proﬁle that is more uniformly valid, one can use a composite approximation

[9]. The idea is to add the inner and outer solutions that have been matched, and to subtract

Cacr, the curvatures of all possible inner and outer solutions have an overlap region, so they can

be matched. Which solution from the overlap region is selected (illustrated by the dotted line), is

determined by (36). Above Cacr no matching is possible, since the the maximum curvature of all

possible outer solutions lies below the minimum curvature of all the inner solutions.

It is evident that hcomp agrees with the full solution for large as well as for small x, hence

it will be the best global approximation at this order of the matching. This excludes the
region ξ <
∼

1 where (33b) has a logarithmic singularity. Figure 7 illustrates the remarkable

agreement of the composite solution with the full numerical result at the critical capillary

number, where the approximation is expected to be worst.

Having studied the critical capillary number, let us return once more to the matching

condition (36) which determines the solutions for Ca < Cacr. Namely, it is instructive to

obtain explicit solutions of (36) in the limit of small Ca, in which case its solution s1 is

means one has to go to an even higher order in the approximation, but we are not pursuing

this special case here. The approximation (44) is plotted as the dashed line in Fig.4. If

extrapolated naively to θap = 0, it gives a surprisingly good estimate of Cacr.

V. DISCUSSION

Let us begin by considering rather straightforward extensions and generalizations of the

present theory. Firstly, our arguments are not limited to a speciﬁc contact line model,

since they are based entirely on hydrodynamic arguments away from the contact line. For

example, if van-der-Waals forces are dominant near the contact line [11], this only changes

the parameter L appearing in (8) (advancing contact angle) or β in (29) (receding contact

line). In the latter case, the slip length λ in (39) has to be replaced by

A/(6πγ)/(6θe),

where A is the Hamaker constant. Our research also suggests that the calculation of the

p

critical capillary number is captured fully by lubrication theory, even if θe is not small. In

that case the ﬂow directly at the contact line would have to be described without resorting

to lubrication theory [24, 38], but the relevant region where matching occurs is characterized
by slopes h′(x) which are small.

Secondly, one can generalize to a diﬀerent geometry. To this end one has to replace (14)

by the appropriate static solution for the problem at hand. This is done almost trivially

for the case of a vertical plate or a ﬁber [6], in which case the lubrication description (4) is

no longer valid far from the contact line, since θ is not small. This however does not pose

a problem since this part of the proﬁle is determined by surface tension and gravity alone.

In the same spirit, the present model can be exteded to a ﬂow inside a capillary tube, with

only very minor changes to the value of the critical capillary number [14].

Thirdly, one can consider dynamical eﬀects, of particular interest for the unstable case

of a receding contact line. In [14] it was found that when the stationary proﬁle vanishes, it

is not followed directly by the LLD ﬁlm, which is of macroscopic thickness. Rather, there

is a narrow range of speeds where the contact line is pulled up the plate, but at a speed

that is smaller than U, i.e. the contact line is partially slipping. The thickness of the ﬁlm

that is left behind is in the order of λ, i.e. microscopic. Only when the speed is raised still

further does the LLD ﬁlm appear. So far these results are only numerical; a full analytical

theory would be desirable. Note also that these transitions are strongly hysteretical. Once

20

the LLD ﬁlm has appeared, it can be sustained to much lower capillary numbers than Cacr.

It is usually assumed that the LLD ﬁlm vanishes when its thickness has reached the range

of intermolecular forces [5], but we are not aware of any theoretical investigation of this

problem.

Next we come to the experimental evidence. The most extensive experiments on the

critical capillary number for a receding contact line were done with a capillary tube [1],

by pushing out a viscous liquid. Using a variety of diﬀerent materials it was found that

instability occurs at a given value of the reduced capillary number Ca/θ3

e , in agreement

with the present theory. The actual value of the critical capillary number, however, is

about a factor of two too low, if the theoretical estimates are based on λ

nm. Several

∼

possible explanations suggest themselves. First, the materials used in [1] have considerable

contact angle hysteresis, pointing to surface roughness. This will tend to reduce the critical

capillary number [39, 40]. In addition, any speed dependence of the microscopic contact

angle, neglected in the present description, will eﬀectively lower θe and thus lead to a smaller

critical capillary number.

Our theory for the vanishing of the receding contact line has some similarities with an

earlier theory [41], in that the critical capillary number is proportional to θ3

e (cf.

(39)).

However, it diﬀers in predicting a vanishing apparent contact angle at the transition, while

it is θap/θe = 1/√3 in [41]. The approach of [41] is also diﬀerent in that it considers the

local problem in isolation, hence the dependence of Cacr on parameters of the outer problem

like θ cannot be captured. In fact, we believe that the mechanism for instability proposed

in [41], which is based on an approximate solution of (24), contains a ﬂaw. In [27] we use

the case of the advancing contact angle (6) to show that the method of solution proposed

in [41] cannot correctly predict the nonlinear dependence of the angle on speed. But it is

precisely this nonlinear dependence which lies at the heart of the stability analysis of [41].

The most important extension of the present theory of contact line instability however

is its application to higher dimensions, in which the contact line no longer remains straight.

If the plate withdrawn from the liquid bath is suﬃciently wide, the contact line inclines

relative to its direction of motion. Two sections of the contact line that have inclined in

opposite senses meet at a sharp corner, so that the whole contact line is serrated in an

irregular fashion [36].

A more controlled recent experiment is that of a viscous drop running down an inclined

21

plane [3]. At a critical speed, the initially rounded tail of the drop forms a sharp corner.

A recent theory [42] explains the drop proﬁle near the corner of the drop, but not the

critical speed at which the the corner ﬁrst occurs, nor its opening angle. To give a complete

description of the transition, the microscopic neighborhood of the contact line has to be

included, as was done in the present theory for a straight contact line. One important

diﬀerence between the case of a sliding drop and that of the present paper is that recent

experimental evidence suggests that the transition occurs at a ﬁnite value of the apparent

contact angle [43]. Studies to understand the three-dimensional instability of a sliding drop

are currently under way.

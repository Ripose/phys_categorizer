We show that very small-amplitude oscillations of a highly symmetric, spheric or cylindrical,
interface (thin membrane) between two ﬂuids can result in inhomogeneous instability and breaking
of the interface symmetry: the frequency of the breathing vibration selects the spatial symmetry.
This mechanism may govern morphogenesis.

The nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking remains one of the most enigmatic questions of modern science. This
problem emerges in connection with the equilibrium phase transitions, self-organization in nonequilibrium systems
and many other areas in physics, chemistry and biology (see, e.g., [1]), as well as with cell ﬁssion and morphogenesis,
i.e., the development and spatial diﬀerentiation of complex body structures during their growth [2].

In 1952 Turing showed that the homogeneous state of some speciﬁc chemical reactions can lose stability with regard
to a spontaneous increase of perturbations of certain form [3]. Since then the chemical basis is the prevalent idea of
phenomenological theory of morphogenesis (see, e.g., [1,2]). Turing’s model is based on chemical or biological processes
of local self-reproduction of some chemical agent (the activator) and far-ranging inhibition. As a consequence of such
processes a very small increase of the activator concentration in a local region results in a global redistribution of the
substance concentrations and formation of more complex structure [1,2]. However, the Turing’s chemical reactions
are uncommon, unique and very complex processes.

In this work we develop a new mechanism, without complexity, that breaks the symmetry by creating an instability
in an oscillating interface, thin membrane, separating two diﬀerent ﬂuids. In other words, we show that if, for example,
a spherical or cylindrical structure vibrates with a breathing symmetric mode for a given set of the frequencies the
symmetry breaks with respect to bimodal, trimodal, pentagonal, etc. modes, i.e., the vibration frequency selects the
spatial symmetry of the interface.

We consider a thin symmetric membrane, spherical or cylindrical interface, with the radius R0 which separates
two ﬂuids with densities ρ1and ρ2 (ρ1 ≃ ρ2 ≃ ρ) respectively. Owing to Archimed’s force the eﬀective gravity
acceleration operating on the internal ﬂuid is g = ge(1 − ρ1/ρ2) << ge. We propose R0 is small enough, so the
condition γk2
0ρ >> g is valid. Here γ is the surface tension and k = m/R0 is the typical wave vector of
the increasing deformation of the symmetric interface, m = 1, 2, 3, .... This is the condition when we can neglect the
gravity and consider only the eﬀect due to the surface tension of the interface.

m/ρ = γm2/R2

Let us take, at ﬁrst, for deﬁniteness, a spherically symmetric interface S whose radius, R, oscillates with a frequency
0/r2,
ω : R = R0 − d cos ωt. From the incompressibility of the ﬂuid it follows that its radial velocity is vr0 = vR0(t)R2
where vR0(t) = dR/dt = dω sin ωt. (This means that some source, for example, a small pulsating ball has to be inside
the interface.) The vortex-free motion of an ideal liquid (we consider the eﬀect of the viscosity below) is described by
the Euler and the continuity equations:

where Φ is the velocity potential, v = ∇Φ and ∇2
⊥ is the part of Laplacian depending only on coordinates of the surface
S. For the undistorted spherical surface, from the symmetry of the problem, it follows that v⊥ = 0, i.e., ∇2
⊥Φ = 0.
Then, from Eq.2, we can write that ∇2
0/r2. In
rΦ = ∇r(vr0) = ∂vr0/∂r + 2vr0/r = 0, in accord with vr0 = vR0(t)R2
the presence of a distortion, ς, of the spherical surface S the interface radial velocity is vr = vR0(t) + ∂ς/∂t. Using
this, we ﬁnd from Eq.1 that near the interface

where F (t) = dω2 cos ωt is the acceleration of the interface and we neglect the term (v⊥∇)v⊥ in Eq. 4 by virtue of
smallness of ς [4]. Owing to smallness of ς we can write the pressure near the surface as

p = ρF (t)(r − R − ς) + γ∇2

⊥ς + po(t)

(5)

Here we took into account that the pressure at the interface (when r = R + ς) is p = γ(σ1 + σ2) + po(t) where σ1 and
σ2 are the principal curvatures of the interface [4]: (σ1 + σ2) = ∇2
0 . Substituting Eq.5 into Eq.4
we obtain

obtain the equation for Ψm(r) :

with the boundary conditions ∇rΨm → 0 when r → 0 and Ψm(r) = A at r = R0 where A is some constant which
does not reveal itself in the ﬁnal results. Near the interface ∇rΦ = vr = vR0(t) + ∂ς/∂t and so from Eq.7 it follows
that cm(t) = dam/dt(∇rΨm)−1

r=R0. Substituting Φ from Eq.7 into Eq.2 and using Eq.9 and cm(t), we ﬁnd that

These results can be extended easily to other cases. For example, when the interface have a form of a cylinder with
vibrating radius, then Sm = cos(klz) exp(imϕ) and in Eq.13 κm ≃ km and k2
0 where h0 is height
of the cylinder. This vibrating cylindrical body can spontaneously distort in the axis z or with respect the azimuthal
perturbations.

We emphasize that Eq.12 coincides with Eq.(2.12) of Ref. [5] to describe the Faraday’s instability [6] of the plane free
surface of an ideal liquid under vertical periodic vibrations. These equations diﬀer in the values of the parameters pm
and qm. Moreover, in contrast to the Faraday’s instability when the vibrations are reduced to trivial renormalization

of the gravity, in this work we consider spherical or cylindrical oscillating interfaces when the vertical direction, axial
gravity, is not distinguished from other directions. Benjamin and Ursell [5] have constructed the stability diagram
for Eq.12 with respect to the universal parameters pm and qm using the analogy between Eq.12 and the Mathieu’s
equation [7]. From this diagram it follows that the instability is realized only in regions near the points pm = n2
where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, .... In other words, the condition

ω = ωn,m ≃ n−1Ωm = 2n−1km(κmγ/ρ)1/2

(14)

determines the resonant vibration frequencies when the symmetric interface spontaneously deforms with respect to
the standing wave with the azimuthal number m. However, the greater is n, the narrower is the width E(n)
(qm) of the
g
n-th region of the instability for given qm [5,7]. For the widest instability region, with n = 1, the value E(1)
g (qm) ≃ 2qm
for qm < 1. It means that the instability takes place when (1 − qm) < pm < (1 + qm), i.e., the symmetry breaking is
realized for the vibration frequency lying within the spectral range:

Ωm(1 − κmd) < ω < Ωm(1 − κmd).

(15)

The threshold of the vibration amplitude d is limited by the ﬂuid viscosity. For real ﬂuid Eqs.11 and 12 include the
additional terms γmdam(t)/dt and Γmdam(T )/dT , respectively, where γm = 2νk2
mC1m/ω are
proportional to the kinematic viscosity ν and Cm is some constant of the order of unity [8]. The threshold vibration
amplitude, d = dt, for the instability region with n = 1, can be estimated from the condition E(1)
g (qm) > 2Γm, i.e.,
qm = 2κmd > Γm. This condition follows practically from results of Refs. [8] and is obtained in [9]. Using Eq.15, this
condition can be written as

mC1m and Γm = 4νk2

d > dt = 2νCmk2

m/κmω ≃ ν(ρ/γκm) ≃ ν(ρR0/γm).

(16)

For parameters of water dt ≃ 4µm, i.e., the threshold vibration is a very small ﬂutter of the interface.

We propose that the results above may be used as a basis for a simple, without complexity, mechanism to trigger
the fanciful morphogenesis appearing in nature. The frequency of homogeneous interface vibrations self-selects the
space symmetry. If the interface oscillates with a characteristic frequency the germ symmetry will break when its
radius R0 amounts to the quantity satisﬁed by Eq.15 or Eq.14 for n > 1. After the new symmetry appears the growth
rate increases with surface curvature as is usual for many of Stefan-like problems [10].

The mathematical results reported here will be applied in a forthcoming paper to explain the morphogesis of the

acetabularia, equinoderms and cell ﬁsion.

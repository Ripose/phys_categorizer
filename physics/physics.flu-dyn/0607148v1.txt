Computational Euler History

Abstract

A new pseudospectral calculation of collapsing Euler vortices Hou & Li (2006) has
called into question the long-term conclusions of singular behavior described earlier in
Kerr (1993, 2005). This review is designed to: improve the discussion of the detailed
analysis of one test initial condition designed ﬁnd sources of errors, to compare that
with calculations showing no evidence of a singularity, and to document two sets of
discussions. Those prior to 1993 between competing teams. And recent discussions of
what is needed to reach more convincing conclusions.

1 Introduction

Whether or not there are singularities of the incompressible three-dimensional Euler equa-
tions is of fundamental mathematical and physical importance. This review will not discuss
either of these issues or related questions for how this behavior could be applied to our under-
standing of partial diﬀerential equations or turbulence theory. Instead, the focus will be the
history, circa 1990, of numerical calculations that were designed to determine if there could
be a singularity of the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations and how, through
several workshops, a concensus was reached about to address the issue numerically. Analytic
results will not be discussed other than how they pertain to these calculations. One test
calculation from Kerr (1992) will be used to suggest that the diﬀerences between the struc-
tures in the new calculation by Hou & Li (2006) and those presented by Kerr (1993) could
be associated with small-scale noise. How this could disrupt a singular structure forming is
discussed.

The paper is organized as follows. After the early history of Euler calculations is given,
methodologies agreed upon by concensus at several workshops are presented, including how
to compare calculations. Next is a discussion of the uses and dangers of the most robust
approach, namely pseudospectral methods. Then a section compares Kerr (1993) to compet-
itive calculations from the early 1990s. Finally there is a comparison between Kerr (1993)
and Hou & Li (2006).

2 Early Euler calculations

The ﬁrst serious attempt to study Euler numerically was the Taylor-Green calculations of
Brachet et al. (1983). Their conclusion was that vortex sheets suppressed any trends to-
wards singularities that had previously been suggested either by spectral closures or series
expansions. This conclusion was qualitatively similar to the conclusion from two-dimensional

ideal, incompressible MHD calculations (Sulem et al.
rent sheets suppressed trends towards singularities.

(1985)) where it was found that cur-

The next set of numerical investigations used vortex ﬁlaments. While these are a poor
approximation of the Euler equations at the smallest scales, they did provide a global pic-
ture that an anti-parallel initial condition might predispose a calculation towards singular
behavior in a manner that smooth initial conditions might not (Pumir & Siggia (1987)).
This led to two preliminary studies at low resolution (Ashurst & Meiron (1987); Pumir
(1987)) whose only signiﬁcant contribution was that vortex ﬂattening might play
& Kerr
a role similar to current sheets in 2D MHD. Simultaneously, an orthogonal initial condition
was simulated that showed more curvature development than the anti-parallel simulations
(preliminary results by Melander and Zabusky in 1988 eventually appeared in Boratav et al.
(1992)).

All the subsequent calculations assumed an anti-parallel geometry, for which there are
two symmetry planes. One in y−z is between the vortices and was called the ‘dividing plane’.
The other in x − z is at the position of maximum perturbation and was called the ‘symmetry
plane’. (Terminology due to F. Hussain.) The next step was to ﬁnd a better initial condition
within this geometry and the ﬁrst steps towards adaptivity. Melander & Hussain (1989)
were able to identify an initial condition where all derivatives in the proﬁle of the vortex
core went smoothly to zero and used a sinusoidal perturbation of the x − z position as a
function of y. The calculation did not take advantage of the symmetries, had uniform mesh
spacing in all direction and was viscous. Kerr & Hussain (1989) tried a truncated Gaussian
core and resolved the discontinuities at the edge of the initial condition by applying a strong
Fourier based hyper-viscous ﬁlter. Kerr & Hussain (1989) used a combination of higher
order trigonometric functions to create an initial perturbation that was localized near the
symmetry plane. Symmetries were used to reduce the computational requirements, the mesh
spacing depended upon direction and the calculations were viscous. Pumir & Siggia (1990)
uses a hyperbolic trajectory for the vortex lines, therefore being the only calculation to date
that is not in a periodic geometry. They used a strictly Gaussian core that does not ever
go to zero, which is possible if one does not have to worry about overlapping across periodic
boundaries. Their calculation was completely adaptive and inviscid.

Of these calculations, only the viscous calculation of Kerr & Hussain (1989) had any con-
sistency with singular behavior. To test the Melander & Hussain (1989) proﬁle in adaptive
calculations, Kerr (1993) and Shelley et al.
(1993) tried Chebyshev and mapped Fourier
(1993) reported consistency with the singular trends of Kerr
methods respectively. Kerr
(1993) concluded that the trends did not favor a singu-

larity, but their calculations used only the sinusoidal perturbation of Melander & Hussain
(1989) and were viscous. Why they reached diﬀerent conclusions was discussed brieﬂy by
Kerr (1992) and will be discussed further here in subsection 5.3.

The only signiﬁcant calculations since then are due to Grauer et al. (1998) and now Hou
& Li (2006). The Grauer et al. (1998) calculation seems consistent with the trends in Kerr
(1993) while Hou & Li
(2006) are compared
in section 6. The Kida vortex promoted by Pelz (2001) as a scenario for a singularity has
recently been shown to be regular by Grauer (private communication).

3 Workshop methodologies

The methodology of Pumir & Siggia (1990) and Kerr
(1993) was worked out at two
workshops on Topological Fluid Dynamics chaired by H. K. Moﬀatt in 1989 and 1991. These

were the IUTAM Symposium on Topological Fluid Dynamics in August 1989 in Cambridge,
England and the Program on Topological Fluid Dynamics at the Institute for Theoretical
Physics in Santa Barbara in the Fall of 1991, with a symposium on issues in Euler at the
end of October 1991.

The following principles were worked out at those programs in discussions between most
of the principal authors at that time such as U. Frisch, F. Hussain, R.M. Kerr, R. Pelz, A.
Pumir E.D. Siggia, N. Zabusky, and the other participants in those workshops.

These are some of the rules:

a) Run only Euler. Do not try to reach conclusions about Euler using a series of decreas-
ing viscosity Navier-Stokes calculations. The range of Reynolds numbers available to
Navier-Stokes calculations at that time is too short to be useful in reaching any deﬁnite
conclusions.

b) Use reﬁned meshes. Even the easy solution of diﬀerent mesh sizes in diﬀerent directions,
as in Kerr & Hussain (1989), has limitations. There is too much space over which
nothing is happening. Complementary pseudo-spectral calculations can still be useful
to conﬁrm the numerical method, but serious compromises have to be made as discussed
below.

c) Have a localized initial perturbation. Orthogonal vortices and the hyperbolic trajectory
of Pumir & Siggia (1990) automatically satisfy this. Kerr & Hussain (1989) and Kerr
(1993) satisfy this condition using a map of a sinusoidal perturbation.

d) One needs to demonstrate structures that wouldn’t be subject to depletion of nonlin-
earity. In particular if vortex sheets appear, they must develop strong curvature or
kinks.

e) The primary quantity of interest is the L∞ norm of vorticity kωk∞ so that consistency
with the analytic result of Beale et al. (1984) can be tested. If singular behavior is
suspected, then the following must be obeyed:

t

Z
0

kωk∞ dt → ∞

(1)

f) If it has power-law behavior of the form kωk∞ ∼ (T − t)−γ and γ < 1, then the

calculation is incorrect.

g) The best way to test (1) is to assume γ = 1. This would be dimensionally consistent.

h) However, using kωk∞ by itself can lead to misleading conclusions either way. Double
exponentials are indistinguishable from power laws and at late times it is impossible to
avoid some slowing of singular trends, which could lead to the appearance of saturation
if one assumes that α = dkωk∞ /dt.

i) Therefore one must calculate the time derivative of kωk∞ directly, that is α = ωieijωj/|ω|2
directly, which should also have time-integral singular growth (Ponce (1985)). In the
anti-parallel case α is just the velocity derivative on the symmetry plane of the axial
velocity. This gives an independent measure of singular activity While ﬁnding αp at
the point of kωk∞ is most desirable, ﬁnding αs = sup(α) in the symmetry plane was
found to work better in Kerr (1993).

j) One needs a measure of collapse to satisfy the condition of Caﬀarelle et al. (1982).

Some of these rules were reﬁned by further conversations between R.M. Kerr and A.
Majda during a two week workshop at the Research Institute in Mathematical Sciences in
Kyoto, Japan in October 1992.

Besides the rules just listed, other tests that have been tried and their order of success

are as follows:

k) Finding independently that

Ωpr =

dV ωieijωj ∼

with the same singular time as for kωk∞ and α. The evidence from Kerr
that this test works better than ﬁnding either αp or αs deﬁned above.

(1993) is

l) Pumir & Siggia (1990) discusses how the position of kωk∞ moves. Kerr

(1993)
goes further and tries to show that the positions (x, z)p of all minima and maxima
of components of the stress tensor in the symmetry plane collapse to the positions of
kωk∞ . That is

xp − X(T ) ∼ T − t

,

zp ∼ T − t

m) Kerr (2005) goes further still by looking at proﬁles.

n) sup(|v|2) ∼ T − t where v is the axial velocity in the direction of vorticity in the
symmetry plane. This would provide consistency with a suggestion from Constantin et
al. (1996). The only evidence for this is marginal from Kerr (2005). We need a good
calculation to test this.

o) Curvature blowup as κ−2 ∼ (T − t). Again, this would provide consistency with a
suggestion from Constantin et al. (1996). So far this is only inferred by related scaling
properties in Kerr (2005). Again, a good calculation is needed to test this.

4 Uses and pitfalls for pseudospectral

For any problem where most of the domain is not involved in the dynamics, as for this
possibly singular equation, uniform mesh methods waste most of the computational domain.
Pseudospectral codes fall into this class of methods. Besides being limited in the local reso-
lution they can provide, pseudospectral codes have the additional annoyance of a continuing
debate over how to handle the high wavenumber cutoﬀ.

Many strategies have been tried over the years. Initially Orszag and Patterson decided
upon a spherical truncation which was corrected by adding together two phase-shifted ver-
sions of the nonlinear terms. Then NASA Ames proposed the Leonard ﬁlter for LES cal-
culations. By the mid-1980s it was generally agreed that none of these tricks gained one
anything. LES calculations started using only a sharp-wavenumber cutoﬀ with the 2/3rds
rule and DNS in wall-bounded ﬂows at NASA Ames/CTR did the same. All of my calcula-
tions after 1985, whether Euler, Navier-Stokes, or convection have followed this policy.

The issue has been reopened by Hou & Li (2006) claiming to have found a ﬁlter with
36th-order accuracy. So let me summarize my understanding of the good and bad points of
diﬀerent methods for the Euler problem.

Options for high wavenumber cutoﬀ of Euler:

– Good: absolutely no wavenumber contributions for k > (2/3)kmax, which would

• 2/3rds dealiasing.

immediately give errors.

– Good: energy is exactly conserved.

– Bad: An abrupt cutoﬀ leads to Gibbs phenomena (oscillations) in physical space.

– Solution: Must set a strict standard when the calculations must be shut oﬀ based
upon anomalous growth of the wavenumbers near the cutoﬀ. This is good in that
there is a measure of the errors.

• A smooth ﬁlter that ends for k = (2/3)kmax.

– Good: minimize Gibbs phenomena.

– Bad: Dissipative.

– Bad: No measure of errors.

• A smooth ﬁlter that extends beyond k = (2/3)kmax.

– Good: Maybe minimizes Gibbs phenomena.

– Bad: Immediately adds aliasing errors.

– Bad: might add small regions of negative vorticity that can blow up.

– Bad: No measure of errors.

– Unsolved: What of the claim in Hou & Li (2006) that this converges? And how

does one identify what the aliasing errors turn into?

Despite these problems, it was concluded that in the early stages a pseudo-spectral code is
much better for testing initial conditions, in particular testing schemes for ﬁltering the initial
condition. It was in ensuring that the nonlinearity was not depleted even at low resolution
and early times in such test calculations that led to the initial condition and numerics that
worked so well in Kerr (1993).

5 Comparison of structures and kωk∞ between older

This section will compare three calculations that meet the simulation criteria (a-c) above:

calculations

• Kerr (1993)

• An intermediate time from Pumir & Siggia (1990).

• An inviscid version of the Shelley et al. (1993) calculation.

Earlier calculations such as Ashurst & Meiron (1987), Pumir & Kerr (1987) and Me-

lander & Hussain (1989) met none of these criteria on coarse meshes.

When Kerr (1993) was published, the weight of numerical evidence from simulations with
similar initial conditions was against a singularity. Therefore, in making claims of singular
behavior, besides demonstrating points (a-k) above,the following was addressed:

• The computational power of the calculations ﬁnding exponential growth was matched.

• A modiﬁcation of the singular initial condition was found that was able to reproduce

the exponential behavior of competitive calculations.

• A proposal was made for why there could be at least two types of behavior, exponential

and singular.

While Pumir & Siggia (1990) and Kerr (1993) meet all three requirements, the published
(1993) was neither inviscid nor did it have a localized perturbation.
work of Shelley et al.
A better description of Shelley et al.
(1993) is that it was a slightly adaptive and higher
Reynolds number version of Melander & Hussain (1989). Nonetheless, by giving the proﬁle
they used a localized perturbation and running it inviscidly, the primary conclusion of Shelley
et al.
(1993) could be veriﬁed. This was that for the Melander & Hussain (1989) proﬁle,
singular behavior does not appear.

The goal of working by steps through these three cases is to suggest how the calculation
of Hou & Li (2006) might be suppressing singular behavior due to numerical noise in their
numerical method. The ﬁrst step follows Kerr
(1992) to show how the initial condition
(1993) leads to false regular behavior. Then the graphics for an inviscid
of Shelley et al.
version of Shelley et al. (1993) is compared to the very late times of Pumir & Siggia (1990).
In this way the structures associated with regular behavior will be identiﬁed. Finally, similar
structures are identiﬁed in Hou & Li (2006). This raises the possibility that the numerical
method of Hou & Li (2006) also introduces small scale numerical errors. This will only be
conﬁrmed if their 2/3rds dealiasing calculations are report or are repeated by someone else.

5.1 Comparing structures of Kerr

(1993) and Pumir & Siggia

(1990)

The purpose of this subsection is to compare the structures that arise during the period
with the strongest evidence for singular growth of Kerr (1993) with a brief period of growth
from Pumir & Siggia (1990) that might have consistent behavior. Figure 2 from Kerr
(2005) shows the growth of kωk∞ , max(α)=keyyk in the symmetry plane, and the enstrophy
production Ωpr. This was the primary evidence that these calculations have singular growth.
Figure 4 plots the peak vorticity, peak strain along the vorticity in the symmetry plane, and
the inverse of that strain as functions of time for a 256×256 ×192 pseudospectral calculation
using the initial condition of Kerr (1993). This pseudospectral calculation was not the best
that was done in preparation for the ﬁnal calculations of Kerr (1993), but it can be used to
illustrate the diﬀerences between this initial condition and the Melander & Hussain (1989)
initial condition. The peak of the α∞ = keyyk∞ strain is plotted instead of the value at the
position of kωk∞ because it was better behaved as previously discussed (Kerr (1993)).

The vorticity and strain contours in Fig. 1 are straight out of Kerr (1993) for t = 15.
These plots have been expanded by a factor of 5 in the vertical (z) direction. This time was
chosen because it shows the least numerical noise while being the regime showing singular
growth of kωk∞ . Subsequent to 1993 it was realized that most of the noise in the contours
in Kerr (1993) comes from a high wavenumber spectral tail, which when ﬁltered out gives
the smoother ﬁgures of Kerr (2005). It is likely that the physical space data for these ﬁelds
in this plane is still stored on the NCAR mass store and might be used later to create better
ﬁgures.

The two points of comparison to be made are that:

Figure 6: kωk∞ and α contours in the symmetry plane for t = 7.2 from Pumir & Siggia
(1990)

Figure 7: Growth of kωk∞ , α from Pumir & Siggia (1990)

a) The highest contour of vorticity is placed in the corner of the bent front.

b) There is a steepening of the positive strain contours in the direction of propagation of

the front.

To compare with competitive calculations whose graphic results do not stretch the inter-
vortical (z) direction, it is useful to show contour plots of vorticity in the symmetry plane
without stretching in Fig. 5. The evolution with time is as follows:

• At t = 6 there is only ﬂattening.

• At t = 12 a tilt in the innermost contour appears.

• This becomes more of a crescent in the bend at t = 15.5, which is essentially an
unstretched version of left frame of Fig. 1 with the highest vorticity contour only
within the bend.

How does this compare to Pumir & Siggia (1990)? Recall that they use hyperbolic
trajectories, while all the other calculations use periodic trajectories. Therefore, deﬁnitive
comparisons are out of the question. Nonetheless, Fig. 7 shows that growth of kωk∞ and
αp, the strain at the position of kωk∞ , in Pumir & Siggia (1990) is similar to Fig. 2.
Recall that in Kerr (1993) it was found that while keyyk∞ ≈ 0.1kωk∞ , αp ≈ 0.05kωk∞ .
Therefore there is a short period between t = 7.6 and t = 8.1 where the growth of kωk∞
and αp in Pumir & Siggia (1990) might be consistent with Kerr (1993). Most of the growth
of kωk∞ before t = 7.6 is just to set up the structure. t > 8.1, when saturation appears, is
discussed in the next subsection.

Figure 6 shows contours of kωk∞ and α just before this period at t = 7.2. As in Fig.
1, the highest contour of vorticity is placed in the corner of the bent front and there is a
steepening of the positive strain contours in the direction of propagation of the front. There
is a long tail in the vorticity plot, but it seems to be separating from the contour in the
corner. In these respects the ﬁgures are similar to Kerr (1993).

The next subsection will show that when non-singular growth is observed, these properties

are not observed.

5.2

Initial proﬁle and why a localized perturbation with ﬁltering
is used

There are two critical components in forming the initial condition previously discussed by
Kerr (1992) and Kerr (1993).

• First is using a vortex core proﬁle that, before smoothing, is analytic as originally
proposed by Melander & Hussain (1989). As they claimed, their proﬁle is far superior
to the cut-oﬀ Gaussian proﬁle used by Kerr & Hussain (1989). However, even here,
based on spectra (see below), it was decided that this it was not smooth enough and
a small high-wavenumber ﬁlter was necessary.

• Second, there is the intertwined choices of the initial perturbation in the trajectory of
the vortex tube and of the dimensions of the periodic domain in the axial direction.
This is discussed next.

Following Kerr & Hussain (1989) the trajectory of the center of the initial vortex tubes

was deﬁned as

X(s) = x◦ + δx cos(s)

Z(s) = z◦ + δz cos(s), where

s(Y ) = y2 + Lyδy1 sin(πy2/Ly)

and

y2 = Y + Lyδy2 sin(πY /Ly)

rather than a simple sinusoidal trajectory.

The incompressible vorticity vector for this trajectory was proportional to

Following a suggestion by Melander (private communication) the proﬁle of vorticity about

this trajectory was given by

where

ω(r) = exp(f (r)),

f (r) = −

r2
1 − r2 + r2(1 + r2 + r4)

and a distance r from the center of the vortex core (X, Y, Z) of characteristic radius R is

r = |(x, y, z) − (X, Y, Z)|/R for

r ≤ 1

These formulae have been corrected based upon errors in the text of Kerr (1993) noted
by Hou & Li (2006). Hou & Li (2006) missed the following additional misprint. In Kerr
(1993) and Hou & Li (2006) in the formulae for X(s) and Z(s) (or their equivalents) , ’/Lx’
and ’/Lz’ respectively should both be ’/Ly’.

For δy1 = δy2 = 0 the trajectory is sinusoidal, as used by Melander & Hussain (1989).
Two problems were then identiﬁed with the procedure of Melander & Hussain (1989), which
were replicated by Shelley et al. (1993).

The ﬁrst problem identiﬁed by Kerr & Hussain (1989) was that if a sinusoidal pertur-
bation is used then, as the two vortices collapse in the direction between themselves, they
also expanded in the axial y direction. When this expansion runs into its periodic image,
growth in kωk∞ is suppressed. Doubling the domain size in y does not resolve the problem.
Therefore to localize the perturbation, Kerr & Hussain (1989) and Kerr (1993) chose the
following values of δ: δy1 = 0.5, δy2 = 0.4, δx = −1.6and δz = 0 and z◦ = 1.57 and R = 0.75.
A more serious problem was that the initial proﬁle of Melander & Hussain (1989),
without any ﬁltering, created regions of negative vorticity in the symmetry plane. There are
small negative regions that cannot be seen in the contour plots unless either zero contours
are plotted or highs and lows are given. This is demonstrated in the ﬁrst frame of Fig. 8.

When highs and lows as in Fig 8 are not used in the graphics, one cannot assess the
possible impact of small negative regions. This would apply to the graphics in Pumir & Siggia
(1990), Shelley et al.
(2006) negative
contours would not appear in the initial condition because their initial condition is ﬁltered,
but evidence for negative regions at late times is discussed in the next section.

(1993) and now Hou & Li

(2006) In Hou & Li

Figure 8: y vorticity perpendicular in the symmetry plane. t = 0, t = 9 and t = 13 for Kerr
(1993) calculation.

In preparation for the calculation in Kerr (1993) that used a ﬁltered initial condition,
a variety of initial conditions without ﬁltering were experimented with. A common feature
of all the initial z spectra, or equivalently the initial distribution of Chebyshev polynomials,
was that they went to zero with increasing wavenumber in a sawtooth power law fashion.
An example spectrum is shown in Fig. 9. The envelope of the high wavenumber sawtooth
approximately obeys k−2.

If behavior where an exponential high wavenumber tail or a power law k−γ with γ > 2 is
to be allowed, this type of initial condition should not be used. In fact, Kerr (1993) found
that γ > 3 and associated γ → 3 as the possible singular time was approached with the test
that Ωpr ∼ 1/(T − t) 2.

Increasing the resolution used with the unﬁltered initial conditions did not alter either
the low wavenumber components of the spectra or the magnitude of the regions of negative
vorticity. That is, regions of negative vorticity in roughly the same location and of the
same magnitude appear. This type of spectral behavior is reminiscent of Gibbs phenomena,
that is high wavenumber oscillations that occur when a Galerkin method tries to represent
physical space discontinuities. This suggests that the origin of the sawtooth spectra and
negative regions of vorticity is the sharp cutoﬀ in the vorticity proﬁle used by Melander
& Hussain (1989), although possible inconsistencies between the initial perturbation and
periodic boundary conditions might also have an inﬂuence. This is despite the analytic
formula where all derivatives smoothly went to zero at the edge of the vortex tube. While
this might work analytically, all that a numerical calculation sees is that the vorticity goes
from a ﬁnite value on one side of a boundary to continuously zero on the other side.

5.3 Eﬀect when there is no initial ﬁlter

The calculation in this section is meant to show that if the high wavenumber ﬁlter is not
applied to the initial conditions, then the strain saturates, afterwhich the growth of the
peak vorticity is exponential. Qualitatively everything about this calculation is the same
as the initialization used by Kerr (1993). The only signiﬁcant diﬀerence was that the high

tions.

ticity (triangle), peak vorticity (cir-
cle), peak negative vorticity (plus)

time.

wavenumber hyperviscous ﬁlter was not used.

Only enough resolution to demonstrate these points was used. There are some weak signs
that at the last time calculated that the strain is beginning to increase and singular behavior
might be starting. However, given the success of the ﬁltered initial conditions there did not
seem to be any reason to follow this further.

The suggestion at the end of the last subsection is that isolated points of negative vor-
ticity might cause a problem. The best evidence that these negative regions do aﬀect the
calculation is that while they were initially very small, the order of 4 × 10−3 compared to
the initial peak vorticity of 1, by the end of the calculation the negative peak was the same
order of magnitude as the primary vortex. This is shown in Fig. 10.

Figure 10 also shows the strain, which saturates, leading to exponential growth of peak
vorticity. It was also found that the position of the peak of α is the same distance from the
dividing plane (in z) as the peak vorticity, whereas Kerr (1993) found that the strain peak
is always somewhat further from the dividing plane.

What are the diﬀerences in the structure? The second frame at t = 9 shows that the
vorticity that develops from initial condition Fig. 8 is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than the
initial ﬂattening from Kerr (1993), except it is remaining ﬂat longer. At the slightly later
time of t = 13, a head-tail structure is found as in earlier viscous calculations of vortex
reconnection. The diﬀerence with Kerr (1993) is that the highest contour is spread across
a vortex sheet above the lower dividing plane, across from its mirror image.

The spreading of this innermost contour is the best indication that similar behavior might

be happening in other calculations.

How might these negative regions create this change in structure? Detailed investigation
(1992) showed that the largest negative regions had been

sucked into the region between the primary vortices, that is along the dividing plane. They
then grow enormously and pair with their opposite number across the lower dividing plane
and induce velocity opposite to that from the primary vorticity. This pulls the tail out and
creates more ﬂattening.

A comparison with the late times from Pumir & Siggia (1990) is now useful. That
is for t > 8.1, beyond when αp ∼ 0.05kωk∞ . Recall that in Fig 7, the strain was also
observed to saturate at late times, with exponential growth of the peak vorticity. Based
on these comparisons, the late times of Pumir & Siggia (1990) should be checked to see if
there are similar regions of negative vorticity playing a major role, and if so to determine
whether these regions might then explain the saturation of the strain in their calculations.
The highest vorticity contour is now spread over the entire tail and the strain contours are
not as concentrated.

Figure 12 shows a three-dimensional isosurface plot of the vorticity squared at t = 12
for the unﬁltered initial condition and Fig. 13 an isosurface for the ﬁltered initial condition
at t = 12. Overall, the three-dimensional structure for the unﬁltered initial condition does
not have two-dimensionalization of the vortices, one of the properties observed by Pumir
& Siggia (1990), but does show less deformation than the ﬁltered case from Kerr (1993).
For the ﬁltered initial condition, a crease in Fig. 13 where the isosurface moves away from the
dividing plane indicates where three-dimensional curvature of the vortex lines is occurring.
A similar crease does not appear for the unﬁltered case.

6 Discussion of new Hou & Li (2006) calculation

Hou & Li (2006) have recently released results where the initial condition of Kerr (1993) was
used exactly as originally programmed by using my old Fortran coding. That is: the same
initial core proﬁle, the same initial perturbation, and the same high-wavenumber ﬁltering.
As a result, exactly the same initial behavior is expected and seems to be followed.

of the vorticity squared for (x, y, z) = (4.9 :
8.8, 0 : 3.9, 0 : 3.9) at t = 12 for unﬁltered
initial conditions.

17 (left and right) with the same factor of 5 expansion in the vertical z direction. The t = 17
frame has been blown up by a factor of 6. Unlike Fig. 1, the t = 15 contours here look more
like the t = 6 contours in Fig 5. Or t = 12, except there is no upward tilt on the left, even
some downward tilt. t = 17 is very similar to the calculation with initial noise in Fig. 5

strophy production between Hou & Li (2006)
and Kerr (1993) assuming that they have the

are Ωpr not Ω as indicated.
(2006) the growth of enstrophy is greater for
12 < t < 17, but is less for t > 17. The best
signature of this is the last frame of Ωpr.

The numerical method was similar to that originally used by Kerr & Hussain (1989).
That is pseudospectral using sine and cosine transforms to apply the symmetries and diﬀerent
resolution in the diﬀerent directions. The ratios of resolutions used was diﬀerent than in Kerr
& Hussain (1989), but not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The highest resolution was 1536 × 1024 ×
3072. 3072 mesh points in the direction of greatest collapse makes the local resolution at
the dividing plane comparable to adaptive Chebyshev method of Kerr (1993), while in the
other directions the maximum resolutions were respectively 3 and 4 times more than those
used by the most resolved case of Kerr (1993). It was acknowledged by Kerr (2005) that
the resolution in x was inadequate, although a simple post-processing ﬁlter did allow new
analysis in Kerr (2005).

Another major diﬀerence was how the high wavenumbers were truncated. This report
will conclude that this is the most signiﬁcant diﬀerence. Both the hybrid pseudospec-
tral/Chebyshev code reported in Kerr
(1993) and the totally pseudospectral results from
around 1991 discussed here used the standard 2/3rds dealiasing, which turns a pseudospec-
tral calculation into a true spectral calculation. Hou & Li (2006) claim that one can attain
better convergence by allowing energy in wavenumbers higher than the 2/3rds limit within
a prescribed envelope. The dangers of doing this are discussed here in section 4.

The comparison of the results of Hou & Li (2006) and Kerr (1993) can be divided into

the following three stages.

• Early times, t < 10, where no results are reported by Hou & Li (2006) and for which

this report will assume has identical behavior to Kerr (1993).

• Intermediate times 10 < t < 16.5 where diﬀerences are noted here but not by Hou & Li

(2006).

• Late times where t > 16.5 for which diﬀerences are reported by Hou & Li (2006) and

where they claim that they can successfully calculate until t = 19.

Resolution and late times will be considered ﬁrst so as to review the diﬀerences noted by
Hou & Li (2006). Then the intermediate stage will be discussed to show that diﬀerences
appear much earlier. This will be used to understand the late time diﬀerences.

6.1 Resolution and late times

Besides the calculation discussed in Sec. 5.3 that used a fully pseudospectral calculation,
(1993) was a fully pseu-
among the tests done prior to publication of the results in Kerr
dospectral calculation using nearly the same ﬁltered, initial condition as Kerr (1993). The
same initial peak vorticity and perturbation were used. The only diﬀerence was a less severe
initial ﬁlter. The maximum resolution used was 256 × 64 × 512 and the last reliable time
was estimated to be t = 15 when kωk∞ = 5.7. This calculation is mentioned here only to
note that tests were done to determine what level of resolution would be needed to reach
a given level of singular behavior with a totally pseudospectral code. My recollection that
a remesh onto the 256 × 64 × 512 mesh from a 128 × 64 × 256 was required at t = 13.5
when kωk∞ = 4. That is for every desired doubling in kωk∞ , the resolution needed to be
quadrupoled in at least the x and z directions. Based upon this estimate and assuming the
singular growth reported by Kerr (1993), with 3072 mesh points in z, the maximum kωk∞
that could be obtained would be 14 at t ≈ 17.3.
Based upon this, the claim by Hou & Li

(2006) that they can calculate until t = 19
would only be possible if there isn’t singular growth in kωk∞ and the position of kωk∞ does

not collapse as much as in Kerr (1993). As evidence that their calculation is resolved until
that time, Hou & Li (2006) state that they still have 8 mesh points between the position
of kωk∞ and the dividing plane at that time. A useful comparison between Kerr (1993)
and Hou & Li (2006) is Fig. 9 in Hou & Li (2006), where there is a clear break in kωk∞
starting at t = 16.5. from the kωk∞ ≈ c/(18.7 − t) result of Kerr (1993).

From this one might conclude that the calculation of Kerr (1993) should not have been

run beyond about t = 16.5. However, the structural diﬀerences arise far before t = 16.5.

6.2 Structural diﬀerences at t = 15

(1993) and the pseudospectral test just
Based on the comparisons of resolutions in Kerr
(1993) is resolved at least until t = 16.5. Fig. 1,
mentioned, the evidence is that Kerr
take from Kerr (1993) at t = 15 < 16.5, shows that the innermost vorticity contour is in
the corner. In Fig. 14, taken from Fig. 15 of Hou & Li (2006), the innermost contour is
ﬂattened.

What the contours from Hou & Li

(2006) most resemble are the later times from the
unﬁltered calculation from Kerr (1992) in Fig. 8 and t > 8.2 from Pumir & Siggia (1990)
shown in Fig. 11. This suggests that noise at the small scales that becomes ampliﬁed is the
source of the diﬀerences. Since they do ﬁlter their initial condition, where does the necessary
noise come from? The most likely source would be retaining wavenumbers beyond the 2/3rds
rule cutoﬀ.

The simplest test of this proposal would be to check for small negative regions of vorticity,
locate them, and plot how they grow in time. Our plan is to run independent calculations
to check this possibility.

Another sign of a diﬀerence for t < 17 is obtained by comparing the behavior of enstrophy
and its production plotted in Fig 5.3. Upon my suggestion, Hou & Li (2006) added the time
dependence of enstrophy Ω and enstrophy production Ωpr to the version they submitted.
The units are not those used by Kerr
(1993), so in Fig 5.3 the assumption is made that
(1993) and Hou & Li (2006) calculations are identical for t < 10 and therefore
the Kerr
by scaling their values at t = 10, a comparison can be made. The discussion in Hou & Li
(2006) suggests that the values of Ωpr shown were calculated from (d/dt)Ω and not from

dV ωieijωj directly.

Both Ω and Ωpr grow faster than in Kerr (1993) for 12 < t < 16 and then more slowly.
R
This is seen best in the third ﬁgure for Ωpr. This trend would be consistent with there being
more enstrophy growth in the long tail initially, but less concentration in the corner to build
upon at later times. In the table below the numbers used to make these plots are given. The
enstrophy results from Kerr (1993) correct a misprint. The formula for enstrophy in Kerr
(1993) should have been: Ω = −.0105 log(18.9 − t) + .05, giving Ω(t = 0) = .019.

7 Moving forward

In March 2003, A. Bhattacharee, U. Frisch, R.M. Kerr, N. Zabusky and others met at the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton to consider what direction a new computational
eﬀort should follow. This meeting was instigated by the untimely death of our friend and
collegue Rich Pelz.

The primary conclusion that was reached was that there was a serious problem where
each numerical method seemed to give a diﬀerent answer. It was concluded that this was
primarily because each team was pushing their calculations a little too far.
In the early
1990s there was really no choice. To get any trend one had to overextend the calculations.
In the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century there is the luxury of far greater computing power
and signiﬁcantly improved numerical methods. Therefore it was decided to propose an
international collaborative eﬀort based on:

• A factor of at least 4 increase in resolution in each direction

• Availability of modern adaptive mesh ﬁnite diﬀerence and spectral element codes ca-

pable of providing signiﬁcant improvements in local resolution.

• Separate groups should conduct simultaneous simulations with the same initial con-
ditions. The only results that should be reported are until a time when the two
calculations diﬀer only by an agreed upon amount.

Only in the UK was a proposal made. Based on a conversation with R. Caﬂisch from
UCLA, a separate proposal with no communication with the people above, and therefore not
informed of the rules, was funded and went to T. Hou at Cal Tech, Caﬂisch and someone
in New Jersey. The UK proposal between Warwick and Imperial was never funded due to
the poor rules for reviewing interdisciplinary proposals in the UK. Funding has ﬁnally been
obtained from the Leverhulme Foundation, but only for one post-doc at Warwick.

The original intention was that the two ﬁrst adaptive codes to be used would be the
spectral element code of Barkley at Warwick and some variant of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence adaptive
code of Grauer in Bochum or from within Bhattacharjeee’s group at New Hampshire. Later,
the improved spectral element code of Sherwin from Imperial would be used.

Most likely at this time we will go directly to Sherwin’s spectral element code and work

with Pumir on reviving his adaptive-mesh ﬁnite diﬀerence code.

However, the ﬁrst priority now is to address the issues raised by Hou & Li (2006). There-
fore, their calculations will be repeated and compared in detail with a straight pseudospectral
calculation using a strict 2/3rds rule and stopped early enough so that there are no questions
about small-scale resolution. This should be near t = 17, although the comparison above
suggests that a diﬀerence should show up as early as t = 15.

Abstract

This report proposes a new method to study vortex tubes in one-dimensional

velocity data of experimental turbulence. Vortex tubes are detected as local

maxima on the scale-space plot of wavelet transforms of the velocity data.

Then it is possible to extract a typical velocity pattern. The result for data

obtained in a wind tunnel is consistent with those of three-dimensional direct

numerical simulations.

By using direct numerical simulations and bubble/cavitation experiments, it has been

established that turbulence contains vortex tubes [1–4]. Regions of intense vorticity are or-

ganized into tubes. Their radii and lengths are, respectively, of the orders of the Kolmogorov

length η and the integral length L. Vortex tubes occupy a small fraction of the volume and

are embedded in a background ﬂow, which is random and of large scales.

Especially when the Reynolds number Reλ is high, eﬀects of vortex tubes on the velocity

ﬁeld are of interest [4]. The velocity signal at small scales is enhanced only in a fraction of the

volume. This ﬁne-structure intermittency is attributable to vortex tubes. With increasing

the Reynolds number, the ﬂatness factor of the velocity derivative becomes high. This means

that turbulence becomes more intermittent.

However, in direct numerical simulations, the Reynolds number is always low, Reλ <

∼ 200.

For the higher Reynolds numbers, one inevitably resorts to standard experiments, where a

measurement is made with a probe suspended in the ﬂow, and merely a one-dimensional

cut of the velocity ﬁeld is obtained. To study vortex tubes in such one-dimensional velocity

data, we propose a new method.

The experiments often deal with the velocity components in the mean-ﬂow direction

alone (hereafter, the streamwise velocity u), but the transverse velocity v is more suited to

detecting rotational ﬂows such as those associated with vortex tubes [5–8]. We accordingly

use this velocity component.

Our method is based on orthonormal wavelets, i.e., self-similar functions localized both in

scale and space. There are several known families of wavelets [9,10]. With a wavelet family,

wavelet transforms are computed from the signal. Since a wavelet function has a zero mean,

the transform corresponds to a variation in the signal at a given scale and a given position.

Moreover, since a wavelet family constitutes a complete orthonormal basis, the transforms

retain the same information as the original data. This advantage makes interpretation of

the results reliable, especially in statistical analyses [11,12].

Suppose that a function v(x) is sampled as a discrete signal v[n] = v(nδx), where δx is

the sampling interval (n = 0 to 2N − 1). The wavelet transformation is written as

2

v[n] = hvi +

ˆvj,kwj,k[n].

(1)

N −1

2j −1

Xj=0

Xk=0

Here h·i denotes the average. The integers j and k specify the scale of the wavelet function

wj,k[n] and its position on the x-axis, respectively. The wavelet transform ˆvj,k is the inner

product of v[n] with the wavelet function wj,k[n] and represents a signal variation of the

scale ℓ = 2N −j−1δx around the position x = 2N −jkδx [11,12].

We systematically detect vortex tubes with diﬀerent scales and strengths as local maxima

on the scale-space plot of ˆv2

j,k/hˆv2

j,ki. Here hˆv2

j,ki is the second-order moment computed

for each of the scales, corresponds to its mean energy, and reﬂects both tubes and the

background ﬂow. The circulation ﬂow of a tube of the size ℓ at the spatial position x is

expected to enhance the value of ˆv2

j,k/hˆv2

j,ki at the scale ℓ around the position x [6,7,10]. If

the value of ˆv2

j,k/hˆv2

j,ki at a certain scale-space position (j, k) is greater than those at adjacent

positions, which are indicated by shaded areas in Fig. 1, we consider that a tube exists at

that position.

The present analysis is based on Haar’s wavelets, each of which is a sharp pulse in space:

for n = 2N −jk to 2N −jk + 2N −j−1 − 1

wj,k[n] =

for n = 2N −jk + 2N −j−1 to 2N −j(k + 1) − 1

elsewhere.

Because of poor localization in scale, Haar’s wavelets were not favored in previous studies.

However, they have advantages. First, contrasting to other orthonormal wavelets that oscil-

late many times in space, Haar’s wavelets represent single oscillations. Since the transverse-

velocity proﬁle of a vortex tube has the same character (see below), Haar’s wavelets work

better in analyses of vortex tubes. With the other wavelets, we have analyzed our data. A

tube is detected repeatedly at distances from the wavelet center. Second, a Haar’s transform

is analogous to a velocity increment δv(ℓ) = v(x + ℓ) − v(x), the standard tool to analyze

experimental turbulence [12]. They have the same sign. Statistical results for Haar’s trans-

forms can be interpreted as those for velocity increments.

The most familiar model for a vortex tube is a Burgers vortex. This is an axisymmetric

steady ﬂow in a strain ﬁeld. In cylindrical coordinates, they are written as

Here ν is the kinematic viscosity. The above equation (3) describes a rigid-body rotation

for small radii, and a circulation decaying in radius for large radii. The velocity is maximal

at r = r0 = 2.24(ν/a)1/2. Thus r0 is regarded as the tube radius.

Suppose that the vortex tube penetrates the (x, y)-plane at the point (0, ∆). Here the

x- and y-axes are, respectively, in the streamwise and transverse directions. If the direction

of the tube axis is (θ, ϕ) in spherical coordinates, the streamwise (u) and transverse (v)

components of the circulation ﬂow uΘ are

u =

and v =

(5)

r2 = x2(1 − sin2 θ cos2 ϕ) + ∆2(1 − sin2 θ sin2 ϕ) + 2x∆ sin2 θ sin ϕ cos ϕ.

(6)

Likewise, for the radial inﬂow ur of the strain ﬁeld (4), the streamwise and transverse

components are

u =

x(1 − sin2 θ cos2 ϕ) + ∆ sin2 θ sin ϕ cos ϕ

ur(r).

If a tube passes close to the probe (∆ <

∼ r0) and the tube is not heavily inclined (θ ≃ 0),

the transverse velocity is dominated by the circulation ﬂow. This situation is important. If

4

∆ ≫ r0, the velocity signal of the tube is weak and diluted by the background ﬂow. If θ ≫ 0,

the contribution of the circulation ﬂow is small. The transverse velocity is then dominated

by the radial inﬂow, which does not have a speciﬁc scale. To such scale-free motions, our

method to detect tubes is insensitive.

The velocity proﬁles of vortex tubes with ∆ <

∼ r0 and θ ≃ 0 are nearly the same [7,13].

However, as indicated by the ﬁrst term of Eq. (6), the radius rx of a tube observed along the

streamwise direction is diﬀerent from its true radius r0 as rx ≃ r0/(1 −sin2 θ cos2 ϕ)1/2. Thus

self-similar functions such as Haar’s wavelets capture eﬃciently those tubes. Although there

might be contamination from tubes with ∆ ≫ r0 or θ ≫ 0, such a drawback is inherent in

any of experimental works.

Hereafter we analyze data obtained in a wind tunnel [8]. Its test section was 3 × 2 ×

18 m in size. Turbulence was produced by placing a grid across the entrance to the test

section. The grid was made of two layers of uniformly spaced rods, the axes of which were

perpendicular to each other. The separation of the axes of the adjacent rods was 40 cm.

The cross section of the rod was 6 × 6 cm. We simultaneously measured the streamwise

(U + u) and transverse (v) velocities with a hotwire anemometer. The probe was positioned

on the tunnel axis at 6 m downstream of the grid. The signal was low-pass ﬁltered at 8 kHz

and sampled digitally at 16 kHz. The entire length of the signal was 2 × 107 points.

The mean streamwise velocity U is 8.70 m s−1. The root-mean-square ﬂuctuations hu2i1/2

and hv2i1/2 are 0.446 and 0.427 m s−1, respectively. Since the turbulence level hu2i1/2/U

is less than 10%, we rely on the frozen-eddy hypothesis of Taylor, ∂/∂t = −U∂/∂x, which

yields the integral length L of 17.2 cm, the Taylor microscale λ of 0.858 cm, the Kolmogorov

length η of 0.0270 cm, and the microscale Reynolds number Reλ of 260.

The velocity signal is divided into 2400 segments of 213 points. To each segment, we apply

the wavelet transformation (N = 13). Then statistics are computed over the segments. We

present results only for the scale ℓ = 8η (j = 10), i.e., the smallest scale to which our method

to detect vortex tubes is applicable. Results at the other scales are similar.

Fig. 2 shows probability density functions (PDFs) of Haar’s transforms (solid lines)

5

and velocity increments (dotted lines). Since the transverse-velocity PDFs are symmetric,

those of the absolute values are shown. The agreement between the wavelet transforms and

velocity increments is excellent.

By averaging signals centered at the position where ˆv2

j,k/hˆv2

j,ki is locally maximal, we

extract typical patterns of vortex tubes in the streamwise (u) and transverse (v) velocities.

The detection rate of the local maxima per the integral length L is 3.37 at ℓ = 8η. Since

a wavelet function is spatially extended, we determine in each case the center position so

that the absolute value of the velocity increment |δv(ℓ)| is maximal. When the increment is

negative, we invert the sign of the v signal. The result is shown in Fig. 3 (solid lines). The

u pattern is shown separately for δu > 0 and δu ≤ 0 (designated, respectively, as u+ and

u−). We also show velocity proﬁles (5) and (7) of a Burgers vortex. It is assumed that the

tube center passes through the probe position (∆ = 0) and the tube axis is perpendicular

to the streamwise and transverse directions (θ = 0). The tube radius rx is determined so as

to reproduce the v pattern.

The v pattern of grid turbulence is close to the proﬁle of a Burgers vortex. Since the v

pattern is somewhat extended, there might be additional contributions from vortex tubes

with ∆ ≫ r0 or θ ≫ 0 and vortex sheets. Previously, velocity patterns of tubes were studied

by averaging for large values of wavelet transforms or velocity increments [6–8]. The pattern

shapes are close to those in Fig. 3, but are biased toward strong tubes. Our results based

on local maxima are more representative of vortex tubes in turbulence.

The u± patterns of grid turbulence appear to be dominated by the circulation ﬂow uΘ

of a vortex tube [13]. There is no signiﬁcant evidence for the presence of the radial inﬂow

ur. A vortex tube is not necessarily identical to a Burgers vortex. The same conclusion was

obtained from direct numerical simulations [1].

The tube radius rx = 10η observed at ℓ = 8η serves as an upper limit for the intrinsic

tube radius r0, which should be several of the Kolmogorov length η. With an increase

of the scale ℓ, there is increasing importance of inclined vortex tubes. There also exist

tubes with intrinsically large radii [14]. On the other hand, the amplitude of the v pattern,

6

corresponding to the circulation velocity of a typical tube, is of the order of hv2i1/2. The

radius of a tube and its circulation velocity estimated here are consistent with those obtained

from direct numerical simulations [1,2].

The statistical ﬂuctuation of the transverse velocity v is shown in Fig. 4. Vortex tubes

are embedded in a large-scale background ﬂow. Hence, from the velocity signals around the

local maxima of ˆv2

j,k/hˆv2

j,ki, the expansion formula (1) had been used to remove motions with

scales ℓ > 8η (j < 10). The resultant ﬂuctuation, which mainly reﬂects diﬀerences of tube

parameters, is comparable to that in a direct numerical simulation [2].

The PDFs of wavelet transforms and velocity increments for the transverse velocity v in

Fig. 2(b) have long tails [4,8,12]. It is possible to study this intermittency phenomenon at

each scale by comparing a PDF of wavelet transforms at local maxima of ˆv2

j,k/hˆv2

j,ki with

a PDF of the whole transforms as in Fig. 5 (solid lines). The PDF of the local-maximum

transforms has a peak at |ˆvj,k| ≃ hˆv2

j,ki1/2 and a long tail toward large magnitudes. If the

condition for the local maximum is relaxed so as to ignore transforms at the smaller scale

j + 1, the result reproduces perfectly the tail of the whole-transform PDF (dotted line).

Thus vortex tubes account for the long tail of the PDF. The situation is the same in veloc-

ity increments, since Haar’s transforms are statistically equivalent to velocity increments.

However, only 10% of the scale energy is shared by the above subset of wavelet transforms

that reproduce the tail of the whole-transform PDF. The background ﬂow is energetically

predominant [13].

Finally, we give additional comments. First, our method to study vortex tubes is crude.

They have been studied with three-dimensional direct numerical simulations in more reli-

able ways [1,2]. Nevertheless, our method is useful at high Reynolds numbers, where only

one-dimensional experimental data are available. Second, although our method is based on

wavelet transforms for the transverse velocity alone, those for the streamwise velocity are

also useful. For example, they could constrain the local strain ﬁeld (see Fig. 2(a)). Third,

our method is intermediate between those of our previous works. We proposed statistical

7

measures based on orthonormal wavelets [12]. Although these measures are not relevant

directly to tubes, they are robust with respect to the choice of the wavelets and thus char-

acterize rigorously scale-space structures of a velocity signal. We also proposed a method to

detect tubes by using the transverse-velocity proﬁle of a model tube as a nonorthonormal

wavelet [7]. Although a nonorthonormal wavelet transformation is redundant, this method

provides high-resolution estimates of the size and spatial position of a tube. We hope that

the application of these methods would improve knowledge of small-scale structures of tur-

bulence.

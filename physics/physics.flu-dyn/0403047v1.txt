Abstract

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been carried out to investigate

the slip of ﬂuid in the lid driven cavity ﬂow where the no-slip boundary con-

dition causes unphysical stress divergence. The MD results not only show the

existence of ﬂuid slip but also verify the validity of the Navier slip boundary

condition. To better understand the ﬂuid slip in this problem, a continuum

hydrodynamic model has been formulated based upon the MD veriﬁcation of

the Navier boundary condition and the Newtonian stress. Our model has no

adjustable parameter because all the material parameters (density, viscosity,

and slip length) are directly determined from MD simulations. Steady-state

velocity ﬁelds from continuum calculations are in quantitative agreement with

those from MD simulations, from the molecular-scale structure to the global

ﬂow. The main discovery is as follows. In the immediate vicinity of the cor-

ners where moving and ﬁxed solid surfaces intersect, there is a core partial-slip

region where the slippage is large at the moving solid surface and decays away

from the intersection quickly. In particular, the structure of this core region is

nearly independent of the system size. On the other hand, for suﬃciently large

system, an additional partial-slip region appears where the slippage varies as

I. INTRODUCTION

A crucial ingredient in the continuum hydrodynamics is the boundary condition of ﬂuid

ﬂow past a solid surface. The no-slip boundary condition, i.e., zero relative velocity between

the ﬂuid and solid at the interface, is a core concept in ﬂuid mechanics [1]. In molecular

dynamics (MD) simulations, however, a small amount of relative slip between the ﬂuid

and the solid surface is generally detected [2–5]. Such slip can be accounted for by the

Navier boundary condition (NBC), whereby the slip velocity is proportional to the tangential

viscous stress and the degree of slip is measured by a slip length [2–5]. As the relative slip

is extremely small in macroscopic ﬂows, the NBC is practically indistinguishable from the

no-slip boundary condition in most situations.

When applied to the immiscible two-phase ﬂow of moving contact line, where a ﬂuid-ﬂuid

interface intersects the solid wall, the no-slip boundary condition would cause non-integrable

diverging stress and unphysical inﬁnite dissipation, which directly imply the breakdown of

the no-slip boundary condition [6]. In the past two decades, MD simulations have shown

ﬂuid slip in the molecular-scale vicinity of the moving contact line [7,8]. Recent evidences

have shown the slip velocity proﬁle obtained from MD simulations to be accountable by the

generalized Navier boundary condition [9], in which the slip velocity is proportional to the

total tangential stress — the sum of the viscous stress and the uncompensated Young stress;

the latter arises from the deviation of the ﬂuid-ﬂuid interface from its static conﬁguration.

The no-slip boundary condition also runs into trouble when applied to the driven cavity

ﬂow, where a rigid plane slides steadily over another, with a constant inclination angle

[1,10]. This geometry readily shows that the no-slip boundary condition would cause the

same non-integrable diverging stress as in the problem of moving contact line. Near the

corner where ﬁxed and moving solid surfaces intersect, the velocity variation becomes very

fast because two diﬀerent velocities are assumed at the two solid surfaces. Moreover, a

velocity discontinuity occurs at the corner if the no-slip boundary condition is everywhere

applied. This is the origin of the non-integrable 1/r stress at r

0. A slip boundary

condition is therefore imperative.

Koplik and Banavar ﬁrst used MD simulations to explore the small-scale structure of

the driven cavity ﬂow [10]. Their results indicate that slip occurs in the corner region. To

uncover the slip mechanism, they measured the microscopic tangential stress at the ﬂuid-

solid interface. This stress measurement led to the conclusions that local non-Newtonian

region exists in a low-shear and otherwise Newtonian ﬂow (at low Reynolds number) and

that the NBC is not valid.

The purpose of this paper is to uncover the slip boundary condition and formulate a

continuum hydrodynamic model for the driven cavity ﬂow, from which we will answer the

intriguing question: In a mesoscopic or macroscopic system, what is the slip proﬁle which

consistently interpolates between the inevitable slippage in the immediate vicinity of the

corner and the no-slip boundary condition that must hold at mesoscopic/macroscopic regions

far away? Success would lead to new understanding to slip and dissipation in restricted

geometries [11].

The continuum hydrodynamic modeling requires a slip boundary condition and a mo-

mentum transport equation. We have carried out MD simulations similar to those performed

for the moving contact line problem [9]. In contrast to the conclusions in Ref. [10], the NBC

is found to be governing the slip of ﬂuid relative to the solid. The shear stress is veriﬁed to

be Newtonian in the vicinity of the corner where velocity and stress variations are extremely

large. Technically, we denote a molecular boundary layer of ﬂuid at the ﬂuid-solid interface.

We then perform stress measurement using a method that is reliable near the interface [9].

Velocity and stress data collected at the boundary layer provide molecular evidence for the

validity of the NBC. We emphasize that unlike the Couette ﬂow simulated in Ref. [3–5],

here the driven cavity ﬂow requires a local veriﬁcation of the NBC, because the slip velocity

varies along the solid surface and this variation becomes very fast in the corner region. As

for the Newtonian behavior, local velocity and shear stress are measured everywhere in the

ﬂuid, showing that the shear stress is proportional to the local shear rate.

Based upon the conclusions drawn directly from the simulated cavity ﬂow, a continuum

4

hydrodynamic model has been formulated, comprising the Navier-Stokes equation and the

NBC. With all the material parameters directly determined from MD simulations, our model

has no adjustable parameter. Numerical calculations have been carried out to produce

continuum results for comparison with MD results.

It is shown that in a wide range of

Reynolds number, MD and continuum ﬂow ﬁelds agree well, from the molecular-scale corner

region (with large slip) to the large-scale outer region (with vanishing slip in a large system).

The largest Reynolds number ever reached is

50, at which deviation from the Stokes ﬂow

≈

is clearly noted (see Sec. VI D).

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst describe the details of the MD simulations in

Sec. II. We then outline in Sec. III our MD approach to the veriﬁcation of the Navier slip

boundary condition. The MD results, later used for hydrodynamic modeling, are presented

in Sec.

IV. A continuum hydrodynamic model is formulated in Sec. V. The numerical

algorithm is also brieﬂy described. In Sec. VI there is a systematic comparison of the MD

and continuum hydrodynamics results. The paper is concluded in Sec. VII with a few

remarks.

II. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS

The purpose of carrying out MD simulations is threefold: (1) To uncover the boundary

condition governing the driven cavity ﬂow (Secs. III and IV); (2) To determine the material

parameters (e.g., viscosity and slip length) in our hydrodynamic model (Sec. V); (3) To

produce ﬂow ﬁelds for comparison with the continuum hydrodynamic solutions (Sec. VI).

We consider a single ﬂuid conﬁned in a two-dimensional (2D) cavity formed by two

horizontal walls in the xy plane and two vertical walls in the yz plane (see Fig. 1) [10]. The

cavity measures L along x and H along z, with the periodic boundary condition applied

along y. The ﬂuid is sheared by moving the upper and lower walls with the same speed

Vw along the

x directions, respectively. Each of the four walls is constructed by two to

±

four [001] planes of an fcc lattice, with each wall molecule attached to the lattice site by

5

a harmonic spring. The mean-squared displacement of wall molecules is controlled to obey

the Lindemann criterion. Interaction between the ﬂuid molecules separated by a distance r

is modeled by a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential

where ǫ and σ are the energy scale and range of interaction, respectively. The wall-ﬂuid

interaction is modeled by a modiﬁed LJ potential

with energy and range parameters ǫwf and σwf , and a δwf for tuning the wetting property

of the ﬂuid. Both Uf f and Uwf are truncated at 2.5σ. In our simulations, the density of

ﬂuid ρ equals to 0.81σ−3, the density of wall ρw equals to 1.86σ−3 (which determines the

wall lattice constant), the mass of wall molecule mw equals to the mass of ﬂuid molecule m,

the parameters in Uwf are ǫwf = 1.16ǫ, σwf = 1.04σ, and δwf = 1.0, and the temperature T

is ﬁxed at 2.8ǫ/kB. The values of Vw, L and H are varied as external conditions in diﬀerent

simulations. The steady-state ﬂow ﬁelds are obtained from time averages over 104 to 106τ

where τ is the atomic time scale

mσ2/ǫ. We have also performed similar simulations for

other temperatures ranging from 1.2ǫ/kB to 3.0ǫ/kB. The MD velocity proﬁles can always

q

be reproduced by our continuum model, with material parameters directly determined from

MD simulations. This is due to the fact that the ﬂuid remains to be Newtonian and the slip

length is a constant at a given temperature. Details will be presented in Sec. VI B.

We denote the region within z0 = 0.425σ of the ﬂuid surface the boundary layer (BL).

It must be thin enough to ensure suﬃcient precision for measuring the slip velocity at the

solid surface, but also thick enough to fully account for the tangential wall-ﬂuid interaction

force. The wall force can be singled out by separating the force on each ﬂuid molecule into

wall-ﬂuid and ﬂuid-ﬂuid components. The ﬂuid molecules in the BL, being close to the

solid wall, can detect the discrete structure of the wall (the ‘roughness’ of the wall potential

[3]). When coupled with kinetic collisions with the wall molecules, there arises a nonzero

z0. Here the subscript x in gw

x and the z coordinates are for the BL at the lower

ﬂuid-solid interface (same below), with the understanding that the same physics holds at

the other three ﬂuid-solid interfaces. From the force density gw

x , we deﬁne the tangential

wall force per unit area as Gw

x (x) =

x (x, z), which is the total tangential wall force

accumulated across the BL.

R

Spatial resolution along the x and z directions is achieved by evenly dividing the sampling

region into bins, each ∆x = 0.85σ by ∆z = 0.425σ in size. The slip velocity vslip

in the

x

lower/upper BL is obtained as the time average of ﬂuid molecules’ velocities in each BL bin,

measured with respect to the moving wall (vslip

x = vx+Vw in the lower BL, or vslip

x = vx

Vw in

−

the upper BL); the tangential wall force Gw

x in the lower/upper BL is obtained from the time

average of the total tangential wall force experienced by the ﬂuid molecules in each BL bin,

divided by the bin area in the xy plane; the ﬂuid stress component σxx(zx) is obtained from

the time averages of the kinetic momentum transfer plus the ﬂuid-ﬂuid interaction forces

across the constant-x(z) bin surfaces, and the ﬂuid velocity component vx(z) is measured

as the time-average of that component within each bin.

In particular, we have directly

measured the ﬂuid-ﬂuid interaction forces across bin surfaces to obtain the contribution of

intermolecular forces to the ﬂuid stress, because the validity of the Irving-Kirkwood stress

expression was noted to be not justiﬁed at a ﬂuid-ﬂuid or ﬂuid-solid interface [12]. The

technical details for the stress measurement near a ﬂuid-ﬂuid or ﬂuid-solid interface may be

found in Appendix B of Ref. [9].

III. SLIP BOUNDARY CONDITION

Figure 2 shows the MD evidence for the existence of slip. It is seen that the slippage

along x becomes quite large near the corner, as already observed in Ref. [10]. In particular,

the ﬂuid undergoes near-complete slip in approaching the corner, regardless of the system

size. (By near-complete, we mean

approaches Vw.) Far away from the corner (for ﬂuid

that extends long enough along x, i.e., L

H), the ﬂow is not perturbed by the vertical

≫

walls due to viscous damping, i.e., the uniform shear ﬂow prevails and a small constant slip

is detected.

The NBC is the simplest alternative of the no-slip boundary condition. It states that

the amount of slip is proportional to the tangential ﬂuid stress at the solid surface. For a

Newtonian ﬂuid, the tangential viscous stress is proportional to the shear rate. Consequently,

the NBC becomes that the amount of slip is proportional to the shear rate ˙γ, i.e., vslip

x = ls ˙γ,

where the proportionality constant ls is the slip length [3–5]. Physically, a nonzero slip length

arises from the unequal wall and ﬂuid densities, the weak wall-ﬂuid interaction, and the high

temperature. Together, they prevent the epitaxial locking of ﬂuid layer(s) to the solid wall,

and thus allow slip to occur. A recent study shows that ﬂuid ﬂow in carbon nanopores is

characterized by a large slip length [13].

The veriﬁcation of the NBC in the driven cavity ﬂow, where slip velocity varies along

the solid wall, consists of three stages. (i) We show that vslip

is proportional to Gw

x , the

x

local tangential wall force per unit area. (ii) We show that Gw

x is balanced by the tangential

ﬂuid force Gf

x. This force balance is necessary because inertial eﬀects are negligible in the

BL of molecular thickness. Accordingly, vslip

is also proportional to Gf

x

x. Here we emphasize

that our stress measurement scheme has been designed to obtain the tangential ﬂuid force

correctly. (iii) We show that the shear stress is Newtonian. From (ii) and (iii) the slip length

ls can be deﬁned and measured.

Troian [3], the slip length ls = η/β increases with the increasing slip velocity when the latter

The BL is thin enough to make the inertial term negligible in momentum equation

(mρVwz0/η

x is balanced by the tangential

ﬂuid force per unit wall area, Gf

x, i.e., Gw

together with the fact that σzx(x, 0) = 0. (More strictly, σzx(x, 0−) = 0 because there is no

ﬂuid below z = 0, hence no momentum transport across z = 0.) It follows from Eq. (1) and

the tangential force balance that

Gf

x(x) = βvslip

(x).

(3)

It is worth emphasizing that the normal stress σxx in the BL exhibits extremely large

variation in the partial-slip region close to the corner, where vslip

varies quickly along x. In

x

fact, the normal stress variation is so large that a small ﬂuid density diﬀerence is even noted

between the low- and high-pressure regions. Quantitatively, the BL-integrated normal stress

z0
0 dzσxx(x, z) is essential to reaching Eq. (3), because close to the corner, the contribution

of ∂x

x is of the same order as that of σzx(x, z0). (In the region of uniform

0 dzσxx(z) = 0.)
R

To summarize, in obtaining the Navier slip condition Eq. (3), we ﬁrst identify the BL and

measure the tangential wall force therein to obtain Eq. (1). We then measure the normal

and tangential stresses σxx and σzx according to the original deﬁnition of stress (because the

9

Irving-Kirkwood expression is not reliable near the ﬂuid-solid interface). We ﬁnally calculate

the tangential ﬂuid force according to Eq. (2) to verify the equation of BL force balance.

Equation (2) is due to the ﬁnite thickness of the BL, in which a tangential wall force is

sharply distributed along the solid surface normal. Nevertheless, it is a reasonable expecta-

tion that the ﬂuid would experience almost the identical physical eﬀect(s) from a wall force

density Gw

x δ(z), concentrated strictly at z = 0 with the same total wall force per unit area.

Replacing a diﬀuse BL by a sharp BL can considerably simplify the form of the boundary

condition, because local force balance along x then requires ∂xσxx + ∂zσzx = 0 away from

z = 0. Integration of this relation from 0+ to z0 yields

∂x

dzσxx(x, z) + σzx(x, z0)

σzx(x, 0+) = 0.

A comparison with Eq. (2) then relates Gf

x to σzx at surface: Gf

x(x) = σzx(x, 0+). Therefore,

σzx changes from σzx(x, 0−) = 0 to σzx(x, 0+) = Gf

This tangential ﬂuid force density is in balance with the tangential wall force density Gw

Now the BL is from 0− to 0+, instead of from 0 to z0 as in the diﬀuse case. Correspondingly,

the NBC becomes

(4)

It remains to be seen if the ﬂuid is Newtonian, that is, if the viscous stress tensor is

proportional to the rate of strain tensor. In particular, we need to ﬁnd out if the tangential

stress σzx is still proportional to the local shear rate ˙γ as the ﬂuid-solid interface is ap-

proached. We have measured both σzx and ˙γ at z = z0, 2z0,

(z = z0 is the top surface of

· · ·

the lower BL). As shown in Fig. 5, the ratio of σzx to ˙γ is indeed a constant at each z level,

but this constant varies a little along z near the wall, due to the short-range density modu-

lation induced by the rigid wall [14]. Far away from the wall, the ﬂuid density approaches a

10

z-independent constant, and so does the ratio of σzx to ˙γ. To see if non-Newtonian response

would arise for large Vw, MD simulations have been performed at Vw

1.0

ǫ/m. Figure

5 shows that the viscosity remains to be a constant for Vw as large as 1.25

ǫ/m. This is

due to the fact that for Vw

1.0

ǫ/m and H > 10σ, the shear rate is

0.1τ −1 or smaller,

whereas non-Newtonian response of bulk ﬂuid is expected for ˙γ

From Eq. (3) and the sharp boundary limit Gf

x(x) = σzx(x, 0), we have Eq. (4). As

the shear stress is veriﬁed to be Newtonian, i.e., σzx = η ˙γ, we obtain the commonly used

hydrodynamic NBC

with the slip length ls = η/β. According to the sharp boundary limit involved in obtaining

Eq. (5), we should compare the MD tangential ﬂuid force Gf

gential viscous stress η∂zvx(x, 0) at surface. Practically, a comparison between the MD and

continuum proﬁles of vslip

V. CONTINUUM HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL

A continuum hydrodynamic model has been formulated for the driven cavity ﬂow from

our knowledge of the NBC and the Newtonian stress. An explicit scheme has been designed

to solve the hydrodynamic model, comprising the Navier-Stokes equation and the NBC.

Material parameters include the ﬂuid density ρ (= 0.81σ−3), the viscosity η (= 1.65√ǫm/σ2),

and the slip length ls = η/β (= 2.3σ), all directly determined from MD simulations. Thus

our model has no adjustable parameter. Numerical calculations show that steady-state ﬂow

ﬁelds from MD simulations can be quantitatively reproduced.

The 2D ﬂow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation

walls (n denotes the outward surface normal).

Our continuum model has six parameters, including the system dimensions L along x and

H along z, the speed of the moving horizontal walls Vw, the ﬂuid density ρ, the viscosity η,

and the slip length ls. Taking H as the length unit, Vw as the velocity unit, and ηVw/H as the

pressure/stress unit, we are left with three dimensionless controlling parameters: the aspect

ratio L/H, the dimensionless slip length ls/H, and the Reynolds number

= ρVwH/η. In

R

the regime of small Reynolds number (Stokes ﬂow) the only controlling parameters are L/H

and ls/H.

The ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme used for solving the Navier-Stokes equation is a modiﬁed

version of the Pressure-Poisson formulation given in Ref. [15,9], where the incompressibil-

ity condition is replaced by the pressure Poisson equation and a divergence-free boundary

condition for the velocity. Variable grids with better resolution near the corners are used to

save computational cost.

VI. COMPARISON OF MD AND CONTINUUM RESULTS

A. Stokes ﬂow

For

1 or smaller, nonlinear eﬀects associated with the inertial term are negligible.

R ∼

As a result, the dimensionless steady-state solution for the ﬂow ﬁeld, v(r/H)/Vw, depends

on L/H and ls/H only. Figure 2 shows the MD proﬁles of vx/Vw in the BL (the slip proﬁles),

obtained from three simulations using the same system size (L and H) but diﬀerent wall

speed Vw. It is seen that the three MD proﬁles approach the same limiting proﬁle [16]. This

is due to the fact that the Reynolds number

ranges from 0.067 to 8.3 in the three cases,

R
thus justiﬁes the Stokes-ﬂow limit. In Fig. 6 the MD proﬁles of vx/Vw at diﬀerent z levels,

obtained from two of the three simulations shown in Fig. 2, also indicate the Stokes-ﬂow

12

limit.

For comparison with the above MD results, the corresponding continuum results are also

plotted in Figs. 2 and 6. They were calculated using the same set of material parameters

ρ, η, and ls (see Sec. V) under respective conditions for L, H, and Vw. The continuum

calculations involve no adjustable parameter, and the overall agreement is satisfactory. A

small discrepancy is noticed for the BL tangential velocity (or slip velocity) in a small region

close to the corner where the slip amount is relatively large and displays sharp decay. This is

presumably due to the short-range density modulation induced by the rigid wall [14], given

the short distance H = 13.6σ here [17]. In fact, this discrepancy tends to be less noticeable

for larger H.

B. Temperature eﬀects

MD simulations have been carried out as well for temperatures other than T = 2.8ǫ/kB.

We ﬁnd that for T ranging from 1.2ǫ/kB to 3.0ǫ/kB, the MD velocity proﬁles can always

be reproduced by our continuum model, with material parameters directly determined from

MD simulations.

In Fig. 7, we show the MD proﬁles of vx/Vw at diﬀerent z levels, ob-

tained from a simulation at T = 1.4ǫ/kB. The corresponding continuum results are also

shown for comparison. They were calculated using the material parameters ρ = 0.81σ−3,

η = 1.7√ǫm/σ2, and ls = 1.27σ. (MD measurements show that the viscosity weakly de-

pends on the temperature, whereas the slip length is strongly temperature-dependent.) It

is noticed that in the partial-slip region close to the corner, the discrepancy here is a bit

larger than that seen for T = 2.8ǫ/kB in Fig. 6. Again, this is caused by the short-range

density modulation induced by the rigid wall [14], given the same short distance H = 13.6σ

here. In particular, such near-surface density modulation becomes more prominent as the

temperature is lowered, and that’s why the agreement here is less satisfactory.

The uniform shear ﬂow in the central region of the cavity is seen in Figs. 6 and 7.

This part of the cavity ﬂow is simply described by the Navier-Stokes equation ∂2

z vx = 0

13

plus the NBC vslip

x =

ls∂zvx at z = 0 and H, from which a constant slip amount vslip

0 =

±
2Vwls/(H + 2ls) can be derived. Note this vslip

0

tends to vanish as H is suﬃciently large.

C. Power-law slip proﬁle

Now we turn to the variation of the slip velocity along the solid surface, still in the regime

of small Reynolds number (the largest

13 for the largest H). We have performed a

R ≈

series of MD simulations using the same wall speed Vw = 0.25

ǫ/m but diﬀerent system

size (L and H). The tangential slip velocity proﬁles at the ﬂuid-solid interface, i.e., the slip

q

proﬁles, are shown in the inset to Fig. 8. Regardless of the distance H, there is always a

small core region in the immediate vicinity of the corner, on the order of a few ls, where the

slip amount displays sharp decay. In particular, the structure of this core region is nearly

independent of the system size. As H increases, however, a much slower variation of the slip

proﬁles becomes apparent away from the core region. To ﬁnd out the nature of this slow

variation, we plot in Fig. 8 the same data in the log-log scale. The dashed line has the slope

of

1, indicating a power-law behavior: away from the core region there is a wide partial-slip

−

≥

region in which the amount of slip varies as 1/(x

xc) where xc is the x coordinate of the

−

corner. According to the NBC, the power-law variation of slippage means the same variation

of tangential stress. Therefore, the asymptotic 1/r behavior of the stress variation [1,18] has

indeed been observed in MD simulations. With H being ﬁnite and L being suﬃciently large

(L

4H), far from the corners there is always a region of uniform shear ﬂow, where the slip

amount is a constant, given by vslip

0 = 2Vwls/(H + 2ls). This is seen from the inset to Fig.

8 where each slip proﬁle shows a plateau. The small constant vslip

(for H

0

ls) acts as an

outer cutoﬀ on the 1/(x

xc) proﬁle at x

H. For our largest MD simulation with

hundreds of ls or even more. A large power-law partial-slip region is signiﬁcant, because

the outer cutoﬀ length scale directly determines the integrated eﬀects, such as the total

steady-state dissipation. While in the past the asymptotic 1/r stress variation away from

the corner or the moving contact line has been known in continuum hydrodynamics [1,18],

to our knowledge the observation that the partial slip is of the same spatial dependence has

not been previously reported.

The continuum results are also shown in Fig. 8 for comparison. They were calculated

using the same set of material parameters ρ, η, and ls corresponding to the same local

properties in all the four MD simulations. The overall agreement with the MD results is

excellent. This not only clearly demonstrates the validity of our continuum model, but also

conﬁrms the power-law partial-slip region in the continuum hydrodynamics.

D. Large Reynolds number

MD simulations have been carried out to investigate the ﬂow ﬁelds at large Reynolds

number. Figure 9 shows the MD proﬁles of vx/Vw at diﬀerent z levels, obtained from a large-

scale simulation for Vw = 0.5

ǫ/m, L = 511σ, and H = 204σ (

50). The approximate

q

R ≈

fore-aft symmetry of the Stokes ﬂow disappears. In particular, the slip proﬁles associated

with the left and right corners are no longer symmetric, especially in the partial-slip regions

where the 1/r variation would appear were the Reynolds number being small. This deviation

from the power-law behavior described in Sec. VI C is due to the vorticity convected with

the ﬂuid. The continuum proﬁles of vx/Vw are also shown in Fig. 9. Excellent agreement

is seen, from the ﬁne features in the molecular-scale vicinity of the solid walls to the global

ﬂow.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In summary, we have carried out MD simulations to study the ﬁne structure of the driven

cavity ﬂow.

It has been veriﬁed that the Navier boundary condition can quantitatively

describe the ﬂuid slipping at the solid wall. It has also been shown that close to the corner,

where velocity variation is extremely fast, the shear stress is still Newtonian. Based on these

15

MD facts, a continuum hydrodynamic model has been formulated. This model involves no

adjustable parameter, and it can produce ﬂow ﬁelds in quantitative agreement with those

from MD simulations.

Recently, people have developed some MD-continuum hybrid methods for the study

of ﬂuid dynamics that involves complex small-scale structure where validity of continuum

formulations is not clear [19–22]. These hybrid methods have been successfully applied

to study the moving contact line [20], channel ﬂow with nano-scale rough wall [21], and

the corner singularity in driven cavity ﬂow [22]. Here we want to point out that when

formulated correctly, continuum hydrodynamic approach may still be applicable to some

of these problems, including the moving contact line [9] and the driven cavity ﬂow. For

each problem, the validity of its continuum model has been veriﬁed, ﬁrst by a direct MD

measurement and then by a comparison with full MD results.

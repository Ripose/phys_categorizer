The evolution of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov (K-Z) spectrum of weak turbulence is studied in the
limit of strongly local interactions where the usual kinetic equation, describing the time evolution
of the spectral wave-action density, can be approximated by a PDE. If the wave action is initially
compactly supported in frequency space, it is then redistributed by resonant interactions producing
the usual direct and inverse cascades, leading to the formation of the K-Z spectra. The emphasis
here is on the direct cascade. The evolution proceeds by the formation of a self-similar front which
propagates to the right leaving a quasi-stationary state in its wake. This front is sharp in the sense
that the solution remains compactly supported until it reaches inﬁnity. If the energy spectrum has
inﬁnite capacity, the front takes inﬁnite time to reach inﬁnite frequency and leaves the K-Z spectrum
in its wake. On the other hand, if the energy spectrum has ﬁnite capacity, the front reaches inﬁnity
within a ﬁnite time, t
, and the wake is steeper than the K-Z spectrum. For this case, the K-Z
spectrum is set up from the right after the front reaches inﬁnity. The slope of the solution in the
wake can be related to the speed of propagation of the front. It is shown that the anomalous slope
in the ﬁnite capacity case corresponds to the unique front speed which ensures that the front tip
contains a ﬁnite amount of energy as the connection to inﬁnity is made. We also introduce, for
the ﬁrst time, the notion of entropy production in wave turbulence and show how it evolves as the
system approaches the stationary K-Z spectrum.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

Wave turbulence is concerned with the statistical description of an inﬁnite sea of dispersive waves, which are
weakly coupled by nonlinear interactions and maintained away from equilibrium by interaction with sources and sinks
of energy. The theory has found practical application in many branches of physics including the description of surface
waves on ﬂuid interfaces[3, 7, 8, 13], Alfven wave turbulence in astrophysical plasmas [6, 12], nonlinear optics[4] and
acoustics[10, 14] to name a few.

The central quantity of theoretical interest is the spectral wave action density, nk, which describes how the exci-
tations in the system are distributed among diﬀerent wave-vectors, k. Under fairly weak assumptions[11], the long
time behaviour of nk is given by an equation known as the wave kinetic equation. For a system dominated by four
wave interactions this equation takes the form,

Equation (1) is the analogue for waves of the Boltzmann equation of classical statistical mechanics. In many applica-
tions, ωk and Tkk1k2k3 are homogeneous functions of their arguments. Their degrees of homogeneity shall be denoted
by α and γ respectively. Under rescaling, k

λk, they transform as follows :

It was shown by Zakharov[15] in the 60’s that if the energy sources and sinks are separated by an “inertial range”,
equation (1) has exact isotropic steady state solutions,

which carry constant ﬂuxes of conserved densities, in this case energy ﬂux, P , or wave action ﬂux, Q, between sources
and sinks. These steady state spectra are the direct analogues of the direct and inverse cascades in hydrodynamic
turbulence and are referred to as Kolmogorov-Zakharov (K-Z) spectra. They have been well observed experimentally
in a variety of contexts.

In 1991 Falkovich and Shafarenko[5] addressed the question of how the K-Z spectrum is set up in time if nk is
initially compactly supported in wave-vector space. They used a self-similar solution of (1) and an assumption that,
for the direct cascade, the total energy increases linearly in time, to show that (5) is set up by a nonlinear front which
propagates towards k =

and leaves the k−(2γ+3d)/3 spectrum in its wake.

However subsequent numerical simulations of the kinetic equation for Alfven wave turbulence performed by Galtier
et al. [6] suggested that the development of the K-Z spectrum may proceed by a diﬀerent route. For the Alfven wave

system, the K-Z energy spectrum has ﬁnite energy capacity, meaning that on the K-Z spectrum,

This implies that the nonlinear front must reach k =
the wake of the front was signiﬁcantly steeper than the K-Z value for times less than the singular time, t∗, and that
the K-Z spectrum then developed from right to left after the front reached k =
. Other work by Pomeau et al.[9] on
the inverse cascade in the Nonlinear Schrodinger equation suggested that there might be anomalous quasi-stationary
spectra associated with non-stationary solutions of kinetic equations. However no-one has yet made a speciﬁc attempt
to search for them.

One of the challenges in far-from-equilibrium systems is to understand the means by which stationary states are
reached and to ask if there are functionals analogous to the entropy in equilibrium systems. What we will show is
that while the entropy, which for wave turbulence is formally (see for example [2])

S =

ln nk dk,

Z

is not well deﬁned on the steady state solutions, spectra (5) and (6), its production rate is. We ﬁnd that for 0 < t < t∗,
when the spectrum in the wake of the front is steeper than the K-Z spectrum, the entropy production is positive. At

established via a front which travels back from k =
. During this stage, the entropy production rate, while still
positive, gradually decreases and asymptotes to zero, its value on the exact K-Z spectrum. We conjecture that this
scenario, established in this paper for the diﬀerential approximation to the kinetic equation, (1), will be widely valid
for ﬁnite capacity non-equilibrium systems, including three-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence at large Reynolds
numbers.

∞

This leads us to the topic of this article. We have made an extensive study of the non-stationary solutions of the
so-called diﬀerential kinetic equation of local wave turbulence. This model equation is obtained from (1) under the
assumption that the interaction co-eﬃcient, Tkk1k2k3 is strongly localised in kk1k2k3 space. It has the advantage of
replacing the integro-diﬀerential kinetic equation with a PDE. We ﬁnd that the qualitative bahaviour observed by
Galtier et al is present in this model in the ﬁnite capacity case. Since we are dealing with a PDE, we can go a lot
further in terms of understanding.

The organisation of the article is as follows. In section II we introduce the diﬀerential kinetic equation and describe
a few of its properties which make it a good model of wave turbulence. We also introduce exact expressions for
the ﬂuxes of energy (P ), the ﬂux of particles (Q), and the entropy production rate in terms of its ﬂux (R) and
its bulk production rate (T ). The latter is always positive deﬁnite. We calculate each of these quantities on the
k−αx. Section III contains the details of some numerical simulations of the PDE. These
algebraic solutions, nk
simulations suggest that the nonlinear front is “sharp” in the sense that nk remains compactly supported for t < t∗.
There is a singularity, a divergence in the second derivative in fact, at the front tip between the regions nk = 0 and
nk > 0. Next, in section IV, we construct a family of self-similar solutions of the diﬀerential kinetic equation which
are parameterised by a single free parameter. This free parameter can be interpreted as the asymptotic slope behind
the front. Following that, in section V, we use this self-similarity analysis to formulate a hypothesis which we call the
critical front speed hypothesis. This hypothesis is based on physical arguments and allows us to select a critical value,
xc, for the asymptotic slope, given by

∝

where x0 denotes the usual K-Z exponent for the direct cascade. This formula is well supported by our numerical
simulations. In our conclusion, we attempt to make a connection with entropy production arguments. Two appendices
are provided. In the ﬁrst, we analyse the mathematical structure of the similarity equation and try to understand how
the critical slope is related to the solution trajectories of the underlying ordinary diﬀerential equation. The second
appendix contains a brief outline of the numerical methods used.

II. THE DIFFERENTIAL KINETIC EQUATION

We begin by brieﬂy discussing the origin of the diﬀerential kinetic equation. Assuming that the wave-action
spectrum rapidly becomes isotropic, and averaging over angles, we can make a transformation from d-dimensional
wave-vector space to frequency space,

If we assume that the interaction coeﬃcient, Tkk1k2k3 is strongly local in kk1k2k3 space then (9) can be approximated
by a diﬀerential equation [4],

I is a pure number which comes from the angular integrations in (10). This equation is called the diﬀerential kinetic
equation.

The local approximation leading to the diﬀerential kinetic equation, (13), is rather drastic and is not justiﬁed for
many of the physical applications of weak turbulence. Nonetheless, it retains many of the qualitative features of the
full kinetic equation, (9). It provides an excellent model in the context of which these features can be easily studied.
In particular, the diﬀerential kinetic equation respects the conservation laws embodied within its integro-diﬀerential
precursor, namely the conservation of the total energy,

and the total number of particles,

It also preserves the scaling and homogeneity properties of the kinetic equation. Consequently, the pure scaling
solutions of the kinetic equation, the equilibrium thermodynamic spectra and the non-equilibrium K-Z spectra, are
also solutions of the diﬀerential kinetic equation. These solutions are of the form nω = cω−x where x takes one of the

Similar expressions, which have the same zeros (as functions of x) obtain for the case when the diﬀerential approx-

III. NUMERICAL OBSERVATIONS OF NON-STATIONARY SPECTRA

Let us now turn our attention to non-stationary solutions of (13). In particular we are interested in how the K-Z
spectra are set up if we begin from an initial condition which is compactly supported at low frequencies. Early work
on this question focussing on the direct cascade by Falkovich and Shafarenko [5] suggested that the K-Z spectrum is
set up by a nonlinear front which propagates to the right leaving the K-Z spectrum in its wake. Recent numerical
studies by Galtier et al [6] suggest that this problem is more subtle. They found that in the case where the K-Z
energy spectrum has ﬁnite capacity, the approach to the steady state proceeds by a diﬀerent mechanism. For this
system the nonlinear front reaches inﬁnite frequency within a ﬁnite time, t∗. They found that the quasi-stationary
spectrum in the wake of this front was actually steeper than the K-Z spectrum. The K-Z spectrum was then set up
from right to left after the front reached inﬁnity.

We investigated whether there was evidence of this behaviour in the solutions of the diﬀerential kinetic equation.
We solved the diﬀerential kinetic equation numerically and followed the evolution from an initial condition compactly
supported at low frequencies. The results presented in this section were obtained by allowing the initial data to decay
freely in the absence of forcing or damping. Some details of the numerical methods used are contained in appendix
B.

Let us ﬁrst consider the situation in which the energy spectrum has inﬁnite capacity, 2γ < 3α. Figure 2 shows a
sequence of snapshots of nω and the local slope at successive times for a system with parameter values α = 0.5, γ =
0, d = 1. We conclude that the slope tends to the K-Z value far behind the front in agreement with previous
expectations. The K-Z spectrum is set up asymptotically in time from the left of the window of transparency to the
right.

Now consider what happens when we increase the value of γ and bring the system into the ﬁnite capacity regime.
Figure 3 shows the absolute value of the local slope of nω at similar stages in the evolution for a sequence of values
of γ in the ﬁnite capacity regime. γ takes the values 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5. Visually, it is clear that as γ increases,
the slope of the spectrum behind the front tends to a value which is increasingly steeper than the K-Z value. This
observation is supported by ﬁtting power law functions to the numerical data. The “best ﬁt” slopes are presented in
Table I along with the K-Z values for comparison. The slope given by equation (8) agrees well with the numerical
observations. The time, t∗, required for the front to reach inﬁnity depends both on the parameters γ and α and on

the initial energy distribution. We have not, in the present work, made any systematic attempt to understand this
aspect of the problem.

The next obvious question is that of how the system makes the transition from this quasi-steady anomalous regime
to the K-Z spectrum which we know to be the ﬁnal steady state. For ﬁnite capacity systems this transition begins
once the front reaches inﬁnity. Clearly we cannot easily treat the divergence of the front numerically. Instead we allow
the front to propagate into a regime of strong damping to the right of the window of transparency. This damping
region is intended to mimic the energy sink role provided by the point ω =
. Figure 4 shows the local slope of nω
for successive times after the front reaches the dissipation region. The results of Figure 4 are for γ = 3.5 where there
is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence of about 0.9 between the anomalous slope and the K-Z slope. We see that the system begins
to relax towards the K-Z spectrum as soon as the dissipation scale is reached. Notice that the relaxation is occurring
from right to left.

∞

Another issue which is crucial to our explanation of the ﬁnite capacity anomaly is the structure of the front itself.
From our numerical simulations we found that the front tip seems to be “sharp” in the sense that the spectral wave
action density remains on compact support during the time evolution. Such sharp fronts have been known to exist
in solutions of certain classes of nonlinear diﬀusion equations dating back to the work of Zel’dovich in the 50’s. [16]
Subsequent work by Lacey et al.
[1] showed that such fronts can be stationary, moving or exhibit waiting time
behaviour where the tip remains stationary for a ﬁnite time before beginning to move.

Let us suppose that our system possesses a sharp tip located at ω∗(t) and

To the left of ω∗(t), we look for a solution of equation (13) in the form of a power series,

where the constants ai and the exponents mi are to be determined by expanding equation (13) around ω = ω∗(t) and

Here x0 = (2γ + 3d)/3α is the exponent of the K-Z energy spectrum. The free parameter, x, is the asymptotic slope
of the spectrum far behind the front. This is because we assume that there exists a quasi-stationary regime far behind
ω−y. We must therefore have y = x in order to cancel
the front, which is a simple power law to leading order, nw ∼
the time dependence from the leading order part of (40).

For a self-similar solution, A must be time independent. We are interested in situations where the system has ﬁnite
energy capacity and generates a singularity within a ﬁnite time which we shall denote by t∗. The appropriate solution
of (45) describing such situations is

The direct cascade has inﬁnite energy capacity for κd < 0 and ﬁnite energy capacity for κd > 0. Upon substitution of

FIG. 6: Application of the similarity transformation, (40), to the direct cascade at three consecutive times We take a range
of values for the parameter x. Graph A takes x = 7.66, graph B takes x = 7.48, graph C takes x = 7.25. The self-similarity
of the direct cascade and the front tip is evident from graph B. For reference, graph D takes x = 6.66, corresponding to K-Z
scaling, and uses a log plot to display the entire function F (η). It is clearly not self-similar for this value of x.

So far, the slope behind the front, x, or equivalently by (48), the front speed, b, is a free parameter in the similarity
transformation. We wish to understand how the system picks the particular value for this parameter. If we are to
observe the Kolmogorov-Zakharov slope behind the front then b must have the value

bKZ =

1/κd,

(57)

−
which follows from putting x = x0 in equation (48). In section III we presented numerical evidence that the slope
behind the front was anomalous. We can also conﬁrm this anomaly and check the correctness of the self-similarity
argument outlined in this section by applying the transformations (40), (41) to the solution of the PDE. In ﬁgure 6 we
have taken a particular solution of (13) at a number of successive times and applied the similarity transformation for
a selection of values of the free parameter x. The data presented is for the case α = 1/2, d = 1 and γ = 7/2. It is clear
that the direct cascade is self-similar for x = 7.48 approximately. This is to be compared with the theoretical prediction
xc = 7.56. The corresponding transformation with K-Z value, x = 6.66 in this case, is clearly not self-similar.

The behaviour of the solution of the equation for the spectrum after the singular time, t∗, is an interesting question.
Let us consider what could be called the “bouncing back” of the spectrum from inﬁnity after t = t∗. Our considerations
are inspired by [9]. Exactly at t = t∗ the spectrum becomes a pure power law, ω−xc, at large frequencies. This can be
understood as follows: any ﬁnite value of ω, however large, is in the wake part of the self-similar solution when t = t∗.
This wake is a pure power spectrum. Therefore at t = t∗, we have a well deﬁned initial condition for the evolution
equation.

This spectrum is not a stationary solution (neither K-Z nor equilibrium) of the evolution equation. The subsequent
evolution should follow the same principles as just before t = t∗: the large frequency part of the spectrum has a
. This timescale is the timescale for relaxation to a stationary K-Z
typical timescale which goes to zero as ω
spectrum with constant energy ﬂux. Although the amplitude of this spectrum itself changes in the course of time, it
does so more and more slowly after t = t∗ so that the changes induced in the K-Z spectrum by the change of energy
ﬂux become adiabatic relative to the inﬁnitely short timescale for the large frequency evolution. This justiﬁes our
consideration of the large time spectrum as a K-Z spectrum although it is not strictly speaking stationary in time.

→ ∞

Let assume now that the bouncing back of the K-Z spectrum from inﬁnity is described by the same self-similar
equation as before t = t∗. One boundary condition is now diﬀerent. The support of the self-similar spectrum now

this stretched scale, the spectrum keeps the same power behaviour as before t = t∗ since the timescale there is long
compared to the timescale t∗
t at the high frequency end. We expect that arguments which we shall present in
section A are relevant here too, with the corresponding solution of the self-similar equation being unique and the free
parameter required to adjust the trajectory reaching the low frequency behaviour along the stable manifold being the
amplitude of the K-Z spectrum at inﬁnity. The solution of the self-similar equation should then specify the shape
of the “bend” in the spectrum seen in ﬁgure 4 and its time evolution will be then given be the same scaling of the
frequencies in the similarity representation of the dynamical equations as we used before t = t∗. Some further work
will be required to make these statements more concrete.

V. DERIVATION OF THE ANOMALOUS SPECTRUM FROM THE CRITICAL FRONT SPEED
HYPOTHESIS

In this section we present a heuristic derivation of the formula (8) promised in the introduction. The program is as
follows. We ﬁrst calculate the energy balance in the neighbourhood of the front tip. We will ﬁnd that the condition
that energy is conserved by the motion of the tip is equivalent to the condition, (45), that the solution be self similar.
Next we calculate the amount of energy, E(t1, t2), which enters the the frequency interval [ω∗(t1), ω∗(t2)] immediately
behind the tip in the time interval [t1, t2]. The critical front speed hypothesis is the following : the physical system
selects the unique value of the front speed such that limt2→t∗ E(t1, t2) is ﬁnite and nonzero for all t1 < t∗.

The basic energy balance equation for the front tip is as follows

This can be expanded to read

We observe that E(ω, t1) = 0 since ω∗(t1) < ω and P (ω∗(t2), t) = 0 since ω∗(t) < ω∗(t2). Hence we obtain the

which is equivalent to the self-similarity condition that (45) be time independent.

Now suppose we take t2 −

t1 to be small but ﬁnite and allow t2 →

t∗. It is clear that the energy ﬂux, (66), entering
the region [ω∗(t1), ω∗(t2)] in this last increment of time before the front reaches inﬁnity is either inﬁnite, a ﬁnite
quantity, or zero. Our hypothesis is that the ﬂux is ﬁnite. It certainly cannot be inﬁnite since the entire system has
ﬁnite energy. It seems unreasonable that it should be zero since the front presumably requires a supply of energy to
continue moving. A ﬁnite value for the integrated ﬂux requires that the power of ω(t2) in (65) is zero. This hypothesis
leads to a unique value for the slope, which we shall denote by xc. From (65):

In order that this remain ﬁnite but non-zero as ω∗(t2)

The physical intuition behind this hypothesis is the following. If x > xc, the front speed is slower than the critical
value. The power in (69) is positive and the energy in the tip diverges as ω∗(t2)
. The front is moving too slowly
for the amount of ﬂux ﬂowing into it so that energy begins to pile up at the tip. On the other hand, if x < xc, the
front moves faster than the critical value. Then energy in the tip decays to zero as ω∗(t2)
which means that the
front is moving too fast for the amount of energy supplied to it. Physically we expect that the former situation would
tend to speed up the front and the latter would tend to slow it down thus providing the system with a self-regulatory
mechanism which selects the marginal slope, xc.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

13

From the work presented here, we are beginning to get a clearer understanding of how the K-Z spectrum is set
up in this model and the origins of the anomalous spectrum in the wake. The most obvious and important question
which we have not addressed at all here is that of whether any of this analysis is relevant for the full kinetic equation,
(1). It seems unlikely that the detailed structure of the nonlinear front would carry over to the integral version of the
kinetic equation. Indeed, it is diﬃcult to see how a sharp front tip could co-exist with the k-space integrations on the
RHS of (1).

Nevertheless, anomalous behaviour has been observed [6] in numerical simulations of the full three-wave kinetic
equation as already mentioned. This gives us reason to hope that some of the qualitative ideas contained here can
be extended to more general kinetic equations. In particular, if the dynamics of the front is indeed regulated by a
critical speed hypothesis of the type proposed in section V, then there is hope that an analogue can be formulated
even in the absence of a sharp tip.

One might also speculate that this mechanism might occur in the evolution of the Kolmogorov spectrum of hy-
drodynamic turbulence since the direct cascade in this case is also of ﬁnite energy capacity. Unfortunately, in the
absence of a closed kinetic equation for hydrodynamic turbulence it is not clear how one would even begin to address
this question from a mathematical point of view. Nevertheless, for the purpose of stimulating debate, let us make
the following conjecture.
In far from equilibrium situations with stationary states which have ﬁnite capacity, the
evolution towards the stationary spectrum takes place in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, 0 < t < t∗, which is rapid, the
system attempts to close the connection with the dissipative sink at very high (or very low) wave-numbers. In that
stage, entropy production is positive as the system attempts to explore all the available phase space subject to the
constraint of energy conservation. The wake spectrum is steeper (shallower if the sink is at k = 0) than that of the
ﬁnal stationary state. This slope is determined by the requirement that a ﬁnite amount of energy per unit time is
delivered to the front tip at all times less that t∗. After t = t∗, energy is no longer conserved but entropy production
is still positive as the system now explores a larger volume of phase space. However, the entropy production now
decreases as a new front with the K-Z spectrum in its wake (between the front and k =
) moves towards lower
wave-numbers and invades the steeper spectrum set up during the ﬁrst stage of evolution. While it may be diﬃcult
to conﬁrm these conjectures in a quantitative manner for the variety of situations to which we suggest these ideas
apply, it should not be too diﬃcult to establish them (or prove them incorrect) qualitatively.

Note Added in Proof

We have subsequently analysed a second order model equation whose structure is similar to that of the diﬀerential
kinetic equation studied in this paper but is analytically and numerically more tractable. We have found qualitatively
similar behaviour. However the value of the anomalous exponent appears to diﬀer from that which would be predicted
by our critical front speed hypothesis.

solutions which reproduce the critical behaviour which we have ascribed to the solutions of its antecedent PDE in

What we observe from numerical solution of the O.D.E. (A2), described below, is as follows. If we choose a value
of x which is not xc = x0 + κd/4, then the solution, η−x, makes a transition near η = 0 to the state η−y, where
y = x0 + κd/2. This behaviour near η = 0 balances the leading order divergences on both sides of equation (A2) as
0. It might be noted, although it may have no relevance to the problem under consideration, that this value
η
for the exponent, y, leads to front dynamics, ω∗(t) = (t∗
t)b with zero b. This spectrum was never observed in the
solutions of the P.D.E.

The problem with integrating (A9) on a computer is that for generic initial conditions, the strong power law depen-
dences of the right hand side on the independent variable render the numerics very susceptible to round-oﬀ error and
numerical instability. For example, to study the system with γ = 7/2, α = 1/2, d = 1, to which we gave a lot of
consideration in section III due to its relatively large anomaly, we are required to take 3x0 + 2 = 22.

To get around this diﬃculty, and to aid visualisation of the global properties of the equation, we make the following

change of variables :

Only the region, f
0 makes physical sense since nω, and hence F , cannot be negative. This system is singular on
the hyperplane f = 0. This system is much easier to integrate numerically and has the added advantage that we can
determine the presence of ﬁxed points which are not obvious in the original diﬀerential equation. Let us determine
these points. It is obvious that the RHS of (A12) has a trivial zero at (f, g, h, k) = (0, 0, 0, 0) = O but this is clearly a
singular point due to the factor of f 2 on the LHS. A second pair of nontrivial (and nonsingular) ﬁxed points can be
shown after quite a bit of algebra to exist at the points P± = (f0, af0, a(a

We are naturally only interested in the point P+ since P− lies in the negative f region. The factors (a + (s
3)/3) are interesting for the following reason. If we substitute back in s = 3x0 + 2 and the value of a
and (a + (s
from (A11), these two factors are simply
κi/2 respectively. At the transition points between ﬁnite and
inﬁnite capacity the ﬁxed point runs away to inﬁnity which suggests that it has a central role to play in organising
the critical solution in the ﬁnite capacity case.

Let us now look for a numerical solution of this system which mirrors the solutions of the diﬀerential kinetic
equation. All the simulations in this section were done using the transformed system, (A12), for which a standard

out-of-the-box adaptive Runge-Kutta routine seemed to work ﬁne. Suppose we want a solution for the wake of the

This maps the point P+ →
(1, 1, 1, 1) for ease of visualisation. The only diﬀerence is that since a < 0, the signs of
g and k are swapped so that the wake part of the solution must now approach O from the direction (0+, 0+, 0+, 0+)
and the front tip, F , is now at (0+, 0+,

).

It turns out to be diﬃcult to ﬁnd a trajectory linking F

O. We performed a series of experiments integrating
backwards from 1
η = ε, with ε << 1, towards η = 0. Because we cannot specify initial data exactly at the
singular point, F , we were required to manually tune the initial conditions quite a bit in order to to reproduce the
η)3/2 structure near the tip. The remaining adjustable parameter is the equation is x. We again choose
F (η)
to study the case γ = 7/2, α = 1/2, d = 1. Two generic types of trajectory emerge as we vary x. We visualise these
trajectories in 4 dimensional phase space as a pair of projections of the actual trajectory onto the (f, g) and (h, k)
planes respectively, hence the apparent intersections.

between these two trajectories is illustrated in ﬁgure 9. Further analysis is required to determine the exact nature of
the critical trajectory. It is not clear whether it will eventually deﬂect away from O for suﬃciently small η. Of course,
in practical terms there is a limit placed on the extent of the scaling region by the left boundary of the inertial range
which cannot extend all the way to 0 in a real experiment.

The system is very sensitive to the value of x. The values of x for the trajectories shown diﬀer only in the
fourth decimal place. In ﬁgure 10, the form of the function F (η) is shown for the three cases discussed above, after
transforming back from the (f, g, h, k), τ variables. The integration was again done for the case γ = 7/2, α = 1/2,
d = 1. Despite the small diﬀerence in the values of x in the equation the diﬀerence in asymptotic slopes is 7.56 for
the critical slope versus 8.5 for the other two.

APPENDIX B: OUTLINE OF NUMERICAL METHODS

We are now including forcing and damping terms, F [nω] and ν [nω] which can be chosen as appropriate. We performed

with the aim of enhancing the stability of the higher order derivatives. This can be rearranged to yield a time stepping

The time evolution operator, L [nω], and source, B [nω], are approximated using centred diﬀerence representations for
the derivatives and a standard linear solver used to perform the inversion at each time-step. Implementing consistent
boundary conditions is a tricky task. For all of the simulations presented here, the equation was solved from a
compactly supported initial condition either in a frequency interval suﬃciently large that the solution does not reach
the boundary within the time allotted or with the damping chosen suﬃciently strong to prevent the solution from
ever reaching the boundary.

Most of the simulations presented here are of a freely decaying initial energy distribution so F [nω] = 0. The damping
was chosen to be zero over most of the interval but increasing strongly for ω < ωL and ω > ωR to produce regions
of strong dissipation at large and small scales. We typically used approximately 10 grid points per unit frequency
interval in our discretisation. The simulations presented here used up to 20000 grid-points. The number of grid
points is practically limited by the fact that one must recompute and invert the time evolution operator, (B9), at each
time-step. Lacking any reliable stability criteria for the nonlinear discretisation scheme described above, the choice of
time-step was essentially made by trial and error. Once a time-step was found for which the evolution seemed stable,
we ran with it. We were aided in choosing this time-step by monitoring the two conservation laws associated with the
total energy and total particle number. Typically, and unsurprisingly, the numerics become unstable most easily at
the front tip. This instability is worse for steeper spectra when the front travels faster. The necessity of reducing the
time-step to resolve this structure as the tip increases in speed also put practical limits on the time interval we could
simulate for. Retrospectively, we would like to do the numerics using an adaptive grid which tracks the front. Such
a method would probably yield great increases in eﬃciency and stability. Unfortunately at the outset, we did not
really appreciate that the code would be required to tackle this problem. We settled for validating our computations
by checking that our ﬁnal results remained unchanged when the time-step was reduced by a factor of two.

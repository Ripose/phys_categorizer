Abstract

Empirical determination of the scaling properties and exponents of time series

presents a formidable challenge in testing, and developing, a theoretical understand-

ing of turbulence and other out-of-equilibrium phenomena. We discuss the special

case of self afﬁne time series in the context of a stochastic process. We highlight

two complementary approaches to the differenced variable of the data: i) attempting

a scaling collapse of the Probability Density Functions which should then be well

described by the solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and ii) using

structure functions to determine the scaling properties of the higher order moments.

Using the example of a L´evy ﬂight, we demonstrate a method for conditioning the

time series that recovers the underlying self afﬁne scaling in a ﬁnite length time se-

ries.

1 Introduction

Theories of turbulence as applied to single point measurements in a ﬂow concern the scaling

properties, in a statistical sense, of differenced time series, where the Taylor hypothesis is invoked

so that the difference between measurements at some time t and a later time t + τ acts as a proxy

for the difference between measurements made at two points in the ﬂuid separated by length scale

L. Studies of scaling in solar wind turbulence have focused on the power spectra and the structure

functions (see e.g. Tu and Marsch, (1995); Horbury and Balogh (1997)) and, more recently, the

Probability Density Function (PDF) (Hnat et al. (2002, 2003b)).

The statistical scaling properties of time series can in general however be considered in a simi-

lar manner. There is a considerable literature concerning scaling in auroral region magnetometers

and in geomagnetic indices (such as Tsurutani et al. (1990); Takalo et al. (1993); Consolini et al.

(1996); V¨or¨os et al. (1998); Uritsky and Pudovkin (1998); Watkins et al. (2001); Kov´acs et al. (2001)).

This is motivated in part by attempts to understand the driven magnetospheric system from the per-

spective of scaling due to intrinsic processes (see e.g. Chapman and Watkins (2001) and references

therein) and their relationship to that of the turbulent solar wind driver. This necessitates quantita-

tive comparative studies of scaling in time series (e.g. Takalo and Timonen (1998); Freeman et al.

(2000); Uritsky et al. (2001); V¨or¨os et al. (2002); Hnat et al. (2003a)). Such studies can to some

extent fruitfully consider the low order moments, whereas a particular difﬁculty for comparison

of observations with models of turbulence is that the intermittency parameter in turbulence τ (2) is
determined by the 6thorder structure function Frisch (1995).

More recently, studies have focussed on the scaling properties and functional form of the PDFs

of the differenced time series (see e.g. Consolini and De Michelis (1998); Sorriso-Valvo et al

(2001); Weigel and Baker (2003a); Stepanova et al. (2003)). This leads to a Fokker-Planck model

in the case of self- similar (Hnat et al. (2003b); Hnat et al. (2004)).

As we shall outline here, the scaling properties of a time series, as revealed from the statistics

of a differenced quantity, may be approached from the generic viewpoint of random walks. We

will focus here on the special case of self afﬁne time series which are found to be described by a

Fokker Planck equation for the time series (as done in the solar wind case by Hnat et al. (2003b),

and for the geomagnetic indices by Hnat et al. (2004)).

2 Self afﬁne time series: concepts

From a time series x(t) sampled at times tk, that is at evenly spaced intervals ∆ = tk −
can construct a differenced time series with respect to the time increment τ = s∆:

their sum gives:

x(t) =

y(tk, ∆) + x0

If we consider N successive values determined at intervals of ∆, that is, y(t1, ∆)..y(tk, ∆)...y(tN , ∆),

where x0 = x(t

N ∆). As N

−

→ ∞

the sum (3) of the y′s tends to the original time series x(t).

We will make two assumptions: i) that the y(t, τ ) is a stochastic variable so that (2) can be read

as a random walk and ii) that the y′s are scaling with τ .

By summing adjacent pairs in the sequence, for example:

y(1)(t1, 2∆) = y(t1, ∆) + y(t2, ∆)

one can coarsegrain (or decimate) the time series in τ . This operation gives the x(t) as a random

walk of N/2 values of y determined at intervals of τ = 2∆. We can successively coarsegrain the

sequence an arbitrary number of times:

x(t) = y(t1, ∆) + y(t2, ∆) +

+ y(tk, ∆) + y(tk+1, ∆) +

+ y(tN , ∆)

· · ·

· · ·

· · ·

· · ·
+ y(1)(tN/2, 2∆)

+ y(n)(tN/2n , 2n∆)

where this procedure is understood in the renormalization sense in that both N and n can be taken

arbitrarily large, so that a timeseries of arbitrarily large length is considered. This procedure can

apply to a ﬁnite sized physical system of interest provided that that system supports a large range

of spatio- temporal scales (the smallest being ∆, the largest, 2n∆, n large), an example of this is

the inertial range in ﬂuid turbulence.

We now consider a self afﬁne scaling with exponent α:

so that

For arbitrary τ we can normalize (τ

τ = 2n∆

Now if the y is a stochastic variable with self afﬁne scaling in τ , there exists a self similar PDF

which is unchanged under the transformation (8):

Importantly, the y′s are not necessarily Gaussian distributed stochastic variables, but do possess

self similarity as embodied by (9).

This property is shared by the (α

ﬁnite variance corresponds to a Brownian random walk. One can show directly from the above

−

renormalization (see for example Sornette (2000)) that the Brownian case is just the Central Limit

Theorem with α = 1/2 and Gaussian P (y). Here, we consider time series which possess the

properties (8) and (9), which may have α

= 1/2 and which are time stationary solutions of a

An important corollary of (9) is of the scaling of the structure functions (and moments). The

via (9).The scaling of any of the moments of a self afﬁne time series is thus sufﬁcient to deter-

mine the exponent. Importantly, all the moments will share this same scaling. This can also be

appreciated directly by writing the PDF as an expansion in the moments. If we deﬁne the Fourier

transform of the PDF P (z) of a given time series z(t) by:

ˆP (k) =

eikzP (z)dz

then it is readily shown that the pth moment is given by:

Hence the PDF is deﬁned by knowledge of all the non zero moments.

3 Testing for self afﬁne scaling.

We now discuss methods for testing for the property (9) and measuring the exponent α for a given

ﬁnite length time series. For the purpose of illustration we consider a L´evy ﬂight of index µ = 1.8

which is generated from iid random deviates by the following algorithm for the increments (the
y′s, see Siegert and Friedrich, (2004) for details):

fµ =

sin(µr)
1
µ (cid:18)

(cos(r))

cos[(1
−
v

(1−µ)
µ

µ)r]

(cid:19)

where r is a uniformly distributed random variable in the range [

π/2, π/2] and v is an exponen-

−

tially distributed random variable with mean 1 which is independent of r. The scaling exponent α

from (8) and (9) is then related to the L´evy index by α = 1/µ.

One can ﬁrst consider directly attempting a scaling collapse of the PDF of differences obtained

over a wide range of τ (see Mantegna and Stanley (1995); Hnat et al. (2003a,b) for examples).

This corresponds to a renormalization of the data as discussed above. We ﬁrst determine the

scaling exponent α from one or more of the moments via (11) or an estimate thereof. In a ﬁnite

length time series, one would ideally use the scaling of the peak P (y = 0, τ ) (that is, the p =

−
moment) with τ as this is better resolved statistically than the higher order moments. In practice

1

however the time series y(t, τ ), formed from the differences of a measured quantity, can as y

0

→

be dominated by observational uncertainties.

Figure 1 shows the scaling collapse (9) applied to a numerically generated L´evy ﬂight (15)

of 106 increments. The curves correspond to differences at values of τ = m∆ with m =

[6, 10, 16, 26, 42]. Error bars denote an estimate of the expected ﬂuctuation per bin of this his-

togram based on Gaussian statistics. We see that scaling collapse can be veriﬁed to the precision

with which the PDF is locally determined statistically. The exponent α = 0.544 used to achieve

the scaling collapse in Figure 1 was determined empirically directly from an analysis of this ﬁnite

length time series based on the structure functions discussed below.

5

As discussed above, the scaling exponent α that successfully collapses the PDF of different τ

should emerge from the scaling of the moments. This is often obtained via the generalized struc-

ture functions (see e.g. Tu and Marsch, (1995); Horbury and Balogh (1997); Hnat et al. (2003a);

Hnat et al. (2004) for examples)

Sp(τ ) =<

p >
y(t, τ )
|
|

∝

τ ζ(p)

(16)

where for self afﬁne y(t), we have ζ(p) = pα (for a multifractal, ζ(p) is quadratic in p). From (11)

the moments will in principle share this scaling provided that the moment is non- zero (however in

a noisy signals a moment that should vanish will be dominated by the noise). In principle we can

obtain α from the slopes of log- log plots of the Sp versus τ for any p; in practice this is severely

limited by the ﬁnite length of the dataset.

The ζ(p) for the above L´evy ﬂight obtained via (16) are shown plotted versus p in Figure 2. On

such a plot we would expect a straight line ζ(p)

pα but we see here the well known result (see

∼
for example Checkin and Gonchar, (2000); Nakao (2000)) that for the synthetic L´evy time series

of ﬁnite length there is a turnover in scaling above p = 2 which is spurious in the sense that it does

not reﬂect the self afﬁne scaling of the inﬁnite length timeseries.

One way to understand this spurious bifractal scaling is that in a ﬁnite length time series the

PDF does not have sufﬁcient statistical resolution in the tails. Infrequently occurring large events

in the tails will tend to dominate the higher order moments. We need to eliminate those large

events that are poorly represented statistically without distorting the scaling properties of the time

series. For a self afﬁne time series an estimate of the structure functions is:

A

SC

p =

y
−A |

Z

pP (y, τ )dy
|

<

≈

y
|

p >
|

(17)

where the limit on the integral is proportional to the standard deviation σ so that A = Qσ(τ ),
τ α shares the same self afﬁne scaling with τ as

√<y2 >
with some Q constant. Now σ(τ )
the original timeseries y(t, τ ), so that if Sp ∼
Q can be chosen sufﬁciently large to capture the dynamic range of y, and provided that P (y) is

∼
τ pα under (9) then SC

τ pα also. Provided that

p ∼

∼

symmetric, (17) will provide a good estimate of α. This is demonstrated in ﬁgure 2 where we also

show the ζ(p) obtained from (17). One can see that once a conditioning threshold is applied, the

self afﬁne scaling of the L´evy ﬂight is recovered and the value of the scaling exponent is insensitive

to the value of Q chosen (for Q sufﬁciently large). We obtain the value of α = 0.544 used for

the scaling collapse in Figure 1 once conditioning is applied, giving an estimate of µ = 1.84,

consistent with the index used to generate the synthetic L´evy ﬂight (15).

6

An analogous procedure to (17) can also be realized by means of a truncated wavelet expansion

of the data (see for example Kov´acs et al. (2001); Mangeney et al, (2001)).

In (17) we assumed self afﬁne scaling in choosing the functional form of the limits of the

integral. In a given time series the scaling may not be known a priori. If for example the time

series were multifractal (ζ(p) quadratic in p) we would obtain from (17) a ζ(p) which varied

systematically with Q. In practice, several other factors may also be present in a time series which

may additionally reduce the accuracy of the approximation (17).

To illustrate this, we consider an interval of the AE index shown previously to exhibit weakly

multifractal scaling (17) (Hnat et al. (2004)). The PDF of differenced AE is asymmetric Hnat et al.

(2003a), and the scaling in τ is broken as we approach the characteristic substorm timescale of

1-2 hours. Remnants of the substorm signature will be present in the time series on timescales

shorter than this. The behaviour of the peak of the PDF (P (y

0)) will also be dominated by

uncertainties in the determination of the signal rather than its scaling properties.

Figure 3 shows a plot of ζ(p) versus p for the AE time series in the same format as ﬁgure 2

for the interval January 1978 to July 1979 comprising 7.5

105 samples. Plots of the structure

functions used to construct ﬁgure 3 are shown in ﬁgure 4. The error bars on ﬁgure 3 are those of

the best ﬁt straight lines to Figure 4 rather than the possible range of straight line ﬁts and as such

→

×

are a minimal error estimate.

We plot in ﬁgure 4(a) the raw result, that is (16) and in ﬁgure 4(b) the conditioned approximation

(17) with Q = 20, the latter corresponding to the removal of less than 1 % of the data. From ﬁgure

4 we see that no clear scaling emerges beyond the third order p = 3 until approximation (17) is

made. Clearly, if scaling is present, the ζ(p) obtained from the raw structure functions (ﬁgure

4(a)) are not a good estimate. Once the data is conditioned, we ﬁnd that Q = [10, 20] give almost

identical estimates of ζ(p) which are weakly multifractal. For Q = 5 the ζ(p) are shifted slightly

toward self similar scaling. The closeness of the conditioned results for the range Q = [5, 20], and

their clear separation from the raw result, suggests that these are a reasonable approximate measure

of the scaling properties of the time series. This procedure can be used to make quantitative

comparisons between timeseries to this precision. Given the caveats above however, we cannot

use this procedure to distinguish whether the time series is self afﬁne or weakly multifractal, but

can distinguish strong multifractality.

4 Low Order Moments and Non Uniqueness.

Equation (14) expresses the PDF as an expansion in the moments to all orders. It follows that

distinct timeseries can share the ﬁrst few moments and therefore if scaling, may also share the

same Hurst exponent and corresponding exponent of the power law power spectrum. Having

estimated the scaling exponent of the AE index as above we can construct a time series with the

same second moment from a fractional Brownian motion to illustrate this.

The fractional Brownian walk was generated using the method described in Appendix 3 of

Peters, (1996). The algorithm takes a series of Gaussian random numbers and approximates a

ﬁnite correlation time by weighting past values according to a power law function. In our case

1024 Gaussian samples were used to create each increment of fractional walk. The resulting time

series is comprised of 7.5

105 increments.

×

Figure 5 shows the two time series, (i) the interval of AE analyzed above, and (ii) the fBm

surrogate. The standard deviation versus τ for the two time series is shown in Figure 6. The

power spectrum of AE (the raw, rather than the differenced variable)( c.f. Tsurutani et al. (1990);

Takalo et al. (1993)), along with the σ(τ ) and the structure functions, show a characteristic break

on timescales of 1-2 hours. On times shorter than this, we can obtain a scaling collapse of the PDF

(see Hnat et al. (2003a), also Hnat et al. (2004). Fluctuations on these timescales share the same

second moment as the fBm. In Figure 7 we compare the PDF of these ﬂuctuations and we see that

these are very distinct; fBm is deﬁned as having Gaussian increments (Mandelbrot (2002)) and

this is revealed by the PDF whereas the AE increments are non-Gaussian.

This is an illustration of the fact that the scaling in AE over this region is not necessarily due

to time correlation, the “Joseph effect” for which Mandelbrot constructed fractional Brownian

motion as a model. Indeed AE has almost uncorrelated differences at high frequencies, as indi-
cated by its nearly Brownian f −2 power spectrum (Tsurutani et al. (1990)). Rather the scaling

is synonymous with the heavy tailed PDF (“Noah effect”) for which Mandelbrot (2002) earlier

introduced a L´evy model in economics.

Finally, we plot in Figure 8 the ζ(p) versus p obtained from the structure function estimate (17)

with Q = 10 for both time series. We see from the plot that both time series are self afﬁne and

to within the uncertainty of the ﬁnite length time series, both share values of ζ(p) for the lowest

orders in p. However the higher order structure functions reveal the distinct scaling of the time

series.

8

5 Fokker-Planck model

For completeness we now outline how the exponent α of a self afﬁne time series leads to the

functional form of P (y) via a Fokker- Planck model of the stochastic process x(t).

A general form of the Fokker-Planck equation can be written Gardiner (1986):

∂P
∂τ

=

∇y(A(y)P + B(y)

∇yP ),

where P

P (y, τ ) is a PDF for the differenced quantity y that varies with time τ , A(y) is the

≡

friction coefﬁcient and B(y) is related to a diffusion coefﬁcient which we allow to vary with y. If

we now impose the condition that solutions of (18) are invariant under the scaling given by (9),

then it is found that both A(y) and B(y) must have the form of power law dependence on y. Then

as shown in Hnat et al. (2003b), (18) takes the form:

∂P
∂τ

=

∂
∂y (cid:20)

y1−1/α

(cid:18)

a0P + b0y

∂P
∂y (cid:19)(cid:21)

,

where a0 and b0 are constants, α is the scaling index derived from the data and P (y) and y

are unscaled PDF and ﬂuctuations respectively.

Importantly, in a physical system the scaling

behaviour (9) is expected to be strongly modiﬁed as y

0, that is, at the peak of the PDF P (y)

→

since for a sufﬁciently small difference between two measurements x(t), y(t, τ ) = x(t + τ )

x(t)

−

will be dominated by the uncertainties in those measurements.

Written in this form equation (19) immediately allows us to identity B(y)

(y)2−1/α and
(y)1−1/α. Solutions to (19) exist which are functions of ys = yτ −α only which cor-
respond to stationary solutions with respect to τ . We obtain these by the change of variables

Power law scaling for arbitrary y leads to singular behaviour of this solution at y

0. We do not

however expect this to describe a physical system as y

0 as discussed above. The singularity is

however integrable so that the integral of (21) is ﬁnite as required.

→

Expression (21) is then a family of solutions for the PDF of self afﬁne time series. This provides

a method to test for self afﬁnity that does not directly rely on determining the scaling exponents

to high order from the structure functions. Having determined the exponent α from the scaling

of a low order moment (say, the standard deviation) one can then perform a scaling collapse on

the PDF; this should then also be described by the corresponding solution of (21) (see Hnat et al.

(2003b); Hnat et al. (2004) for examples).

It is well known that a Fokker Planck equation is simply related to a Langevin equation (see e.g.

Gardiner (1986)). A nonlinear Langevin equation of the form

where β(y) is a y -dependent force term and γ(y) is a y -dependent noise strength, can be shown

(Hnat et al. (2003b)) to correspond to (18) and in that sense to describe the time series. In (23) the

random variable ξ(t) is assumed to be δ-correlated, i.e.,

Consistency with equation (6) is achieved in the data analysis by forming each time series y(t, τ )
with non-overlapping time intervals τ . Deﬁning D0 =< ξ2(t) > /2 we then obtain:

equation with constant diffusion coefﬁcient.

Interestingly, Beck (2001) has independently proposed a nonlinear Langevin equation where β

but not γ varies with y. This yields leptokurtic PDFs of the Tsallis functional form.

Finally the variable τ in (18), and t in (23) can be read in two ways: either as the renormalization
variable of the stochastic variable y(t, τ ) or the time variable of x(t) since from (6) τ = 2n∆ and
with the choice N = 2n we have x(t)

t (n, N large). Thus (23) can be seen as a

6 Conclusions

Empirical determination of the scaling properties and exponents of time series x(t) presents a

formidable challenge in testing, and developing, a theoretical understanding of turbulence and

other out of equilibirium phenomena. In this paper we have discussed the special case of self

afﬁne time series by treating the differenced variable y(t, τ ) = x(t + τ )

x(t) as increments

−

of a stochastic process (a generalized random walk). We have highlighted two complementary

approaches to the data.

The ﬁrst of these is PDF rescaling; using a low order moment to determine a scaling exponent

and then verifying whether this exponent collapses the PDFs of the differenced variable y(t, τ )

over the full range of y accessible from the data. As a corollary this collapsed PDF should also

be well described by the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation which has power law transport

coefﬁcients.

The second of these is using structure functions to determine the scaling properties of the higher

order moments. In a ﬁnite length time series the higher order structure functions can be distorted

by isolated, extreme events which are not well represented statistically. Using the example of a

ﬁnite length L´evy ﬂight, we have demonstrated a method for conditioning the time series that can

in principle recover the underlying self afﬁne scaling.

Finally, to highlight how both these methods are complementary in quantifying the scaling

properties of the time series a fractional Brownian walk was constructed to share the same second

moment as an interval of the differenced AE index time series. The two timeseries were demon-

strated to possess very different PDF of the differenced variable, and distinct structure functions.

Both of these approaches could in principle be generalized to multifractal time series (see e.g.

Schertzer et al, (2001)).

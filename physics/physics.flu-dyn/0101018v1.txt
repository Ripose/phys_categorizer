Abstract

We investigate the linear stability of plane Poiseuille
ﬂow in 2D under slip boundary conditions. The slip
s is deﬁned by the tangential velocity at the wall in
units of the maximal ﬂow velocity. As it turns out,
the critical Reynolds number depends smoothly on
s but increases quite rapidly.

1 Introduction

No-slip boundary conditions are a convenient ideal-
ization of the behavior of viscous ﬂuids near walls.
In real systems there is always a certain amount of
slip which, however, is hard to detect experimen-
tally because of the required space resolution.
In
high precision measurements Elrick and Emrich [1]
detected slip of the order 0.1% in laminar pipe ﬂow
with Reynolds numbers of 16 to 4300. The measur-
ing error in [1] was nearly as low as the ﬂuctuations
due to Brownian motion. Very recently, Archer et
al. [2] observed the existence of slip in plane lami-
nar Couette ﬂow with added polymers.

We examine how the linear instability of the
steady plane Poiseuille ﬂow depends on the slip s
deﬁned by

s :=

uwall
umax

(1)

where uwall is the tangential velocity at the wall and
umax is the midstream velocity. As boundary condi-
tions we adopt

where z is measured in units of the channel half-
width. The slip s is implicitly determined by the
parameter b > 0 with s → 0 in the limit b → ∞.

2 Orr-Sommerfeld equation with

slip boundary conditions

The continuity equation in two dimensions is most
conveniently satisﬁed by introducing a stream func-
tion Ψ(x, z, t) where x denotes the streamwise direc-
tion and z the direction normal to the boundaries
(see Fig. 1). The velocity (u, w) is connected to Ψ
through

u =

.

Poiseuille ﬂow in two dimensions read in dimension-

As usually, Ψ is decomposed in the stream func-
tion Ψb of the steady proﬁle and a Fourier ansatz in
x-direction for the disturbance ﬁeld with the wave
number α:

Ψ(x, z, t) = Ψb(z) +

eiqαxΨq(z, t).

deﬁne also the slip sc by the corresponding normal-
ized tangential velocity of the critical mode at the
wall. The results are listed in Tab. 1.

Obviously, the critical Reynolds number depends
continuously on s. However, there is, perhaps sur-
prisingly, a strong increase both of Rc and sc with
increasing slip s. In the limit b → ∞, i.e. s → 0,
one gets the well-known value Rc ≈ 5772.

3 Numerical method

We determine the critical (neutral) curves in the
parameter space of the Reynolds number R and the
wave number α of the disturbance. The Reynolds
number is based on the channel half-width and on
the midstream velocity of the steady ﬂow.

The solution of the diﬀerential equation (7) leads
to a generalized eigenvalue problem that we solve
numerically as in [3] using up to 70 Chebyshev poly-
nomials as basis functions. The critical curve is
the set of points (R, α) for which the most critical
eigenvalue has zero real part with all other modes
decaying exponentially.

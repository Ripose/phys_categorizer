INTRODUCTION

The addition of long chained polymers to turbulent
ﬂows can result in a signiﬁcant reduction in the drag
[1, 2, 3, 4]. The phenomenon had been discovered in
1949 [5] and had since attracted large amount of atten-
tion, with much of the experimental literature reviewed
and systematized by Virk [3]; the amount of drag de-
pends on the characteristics of the polymer and its con-
centration, but cannot exceed an asymptote known as
the “Maximum Drag Reduction” curve which is indepen-
dent of the polymer’s concentration or its characteristics.
The understanding of this phenomenon had seen signiﬁ-
cant progress recently. A ﬁrst step in forming a new un-
derstanding were direct numerical simulations of model
equations of viscoelastic ﬂows, both in wall bounded and
in homogeneous turbulence [6, 7, 8]. The Oldroyd-B and
the FENE-P models ﬁrst, and then simpliﬁed models like
shell models and Burger’s like models [9, 10, 11], all ex-
hibited drag reduction as a result of including the in-
teraction between the velocity ﬁeld and a second ﬁeld
representing the polymer (end-to-end) conformation ten-
sor, see Figs. 1 and 2. In homogeneous turbulence drag
reduction is exhibited as the increase in the root-mean-
square (rms) velocity ﬂuctuations at scales larger than
the Lumley scale deﬁned as the scale for which the eddy
turnover time is of the order of the polymer relaxation
time. The intermediate scale rms energy ﬂuctuations are
suppressed due to transfer of energy to the polymers. In
wall bounded turbulence drag reduction entails an in-
crease in the mean velocity for a given pressure head,
see Fig. 1. Here the Reynolds stress at the intermedi-
ate scales is suppressed [12]; we will argue however that
there is a diﬀerence between the increase in the rms ve-
locity ﬂuctuations at large scales in homogeneous ﬂows
and the increase in mean velocity in wall bounded ﬂows;
the former disappears when the system size goes to in-

increase in the mean velocity near the wall (small and in-
termediate scales) does not disappear with increasing the
system’s size. This diﬀerence is fundamental to the dif-
ferent symmetries at play, the Galilean invariance in the
case of the wall bounded ﬂow vs. translational invariance
in the case of homogeneous ﬂows. Nevertheless we will
argue below that the two cases can be discussed in simi-
lar physical terms.
In a recent paper it was shown that
drag reduction in wall bounded ﬂows can be conveniently
discussed in terms of a ‘scale-dependent’ eﬀective viscos-
ity. The aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that
this notion is also useful in the context of homogeneous

turbulence. In doing so we aim at simplifying the theo-
retical description, eliminating the explicit presence of a
second ﬁeld in the equations of motion, leaving the ve-
locity ﬁeld alone. The eliminated ﬁeld, which represents
the conformation tensor of the polymers, remains only as
an eﬀective viscosity in the equation of motion. Needless
to say, this eﬀective viscosity cannot be a number, since
the amount of energy transferred from the velocity ﬁeld
to the polymer is strongly scale dependent; in homoge-
neous turbulence this transfer achieves a maximum near
the Lumley scale. In wall bounded ﬂows the degree of
interaction between the polymers and the velocity ﬁeld
is a strong function of the distance from the wall, and
so is therefore the eﬀective viscosity. Of course, in a full
theory a scale-dependent scalar viscosity is not suﬃcient
either, due to the anisotropy of the polymer end-to-end
extension tensor. We would like to demonstrate however
that at least in the model equations a surprising propor-
tion of the essential physics can be captured in terms of
a simple notion of a scale-dependent viscosity which sur-
rogates the existence of the second ﬁeld. This thinking
goes back to some observations a few years ago regard-
ing the importance of space-dependent viscosity even in
the stability of laminar ﬂows [14, 15]. In Sect. 2 we re-
view the two-ﬁeld models in which drag reduction had
been demonstrated in numerical simulations. In Sect. 3
we present the reduction to velocity-alone models with
scale-dependent viscosity. In Sect. 4 we present a dis-
cussion of the large system size limit and underline the
diﬀerence between homogeneous and wall bounded ﬂows.
Sect. 5 is dedicated to a short summary and conclusions.

II. SHELL MODEL FOR DRAG REDUCTION
IN HOMOGENEOUS TURBULENCE

Viscoelastic ﬂows are represented well by hydrody-
namic equations in which the eﬀect of the polymer en-
ters in the form of a “conformation tensor” R(r, t) which
stems from the ensemble average of the dyadic product of
the end-to-end distance of the polymer chains [19, 20]. A
successful model that had been employed frequently in
numerical simulations of turbulent channel ﬂows is the
FENE-P model. Flexibility and ﬁnite extendability of
the polymer chains are reﬂected by the relaxation time
τ and the Peterlin function P (r, t) which appear in the
equation of motion for R:

Here νs is the viscosity of the neat ﬂuid, F is the forcing
and νp is a viscosity parameter which is related to the
concentration of the polymer, i.e. νp/νs ∼ Φ where Φ
is the volume fraction of the polymer. We note however
that the tensor ﬁeld can be rescaled to get rid of the pa-
m in the Peterlin function, ˜Rαβ = αRαβ with
rameter ρ2
the only consequence of rescaling the parameter ρ0 ac-
cordingly. Thus the actual value of the concentration is
open to calibration against the experimental data. These
equations were simulated on the computer in a channel or
pipe geometry, reproducing faithfully the characteristics
of drag reduction in experiments. It should be pointed
out however that even for present day computers simu-
lating these equations is quite tasking.
It makes sense
therefore to try to model these equations further. For
the purpose of studying drag reduction in homogeneous
systems one can derive a shell model whose simplicity
and transparency are assets for analysis and simulations
alike.
In developing a simple model one is led by the
following ideas. First, it should be pointed out that all
the nonlinear terms involving the tensor ﬁeld R(r, t) can
be reproduced by writing an equation of motion for a
vector ﬁeld B(r, t), and interpreting Rαβ as the dyadic
product BαBβ. The relaxation terms with the Peterlin
function are not automatically reproduced this way, and

3

one needs to add them by hand. Second, we should keep
in mind that the above equations exhibit a generalized
energy which is the sum of the ﬂuid kinetic energy and
the polymer free energy. Led by these consideration the
following shell model was proposed in [9, 11]:

(5) reduces to the well-studied Sabra model of Newtonian
turbulence. We therefore refer the model with νp 6= 0 as
the SabraP model. As in the FENE-P case we consider
c ≡ νp/νs to be proportional to the concentration of poly-
mers. In [9] it was shown that this shell model exhibits
drag reduction, and the mechanism for the phenomenon
was elucidated. Furthermore, it was shown in [11] that
for large enough concentration, the Peterlin function can
be disregarded (i.e. P ≈ 1) and, consequently, the dy-
namics of the system becomes concentration indepen-
dent, i.e. we reach the MDR asymptote. This behavior
of the Peterlin function is shown in Fig. 3. Following
the above ﬁnding, we consider below the limiting case in
which the concentration is large enough for the Peterlin
function to be close to unity, P ≈ 1. Finally, all the
numerical simulations reported in this paper have been
performed by using b = −0.2, νs = 10−7 and a constant

III. SCALE DEPENDENT EFFECTIVE
VISCOSITY IN HOMOGENEOUS DRAG
REDUCTION

ni.

Drag reduction in homogeneous turbulence is exhibited
by a relative increase in the rms ﬂuctuations of the energy
at large scales. We thus focus naturally on the energy
spectrum e(kn) ≡ hunu∗
In the context of the shell
model the phenomenon is demonstrated in Fig. 2 where
e(kn) is shown for the given values of the parameters.
The spectra for the pure Sabra model (line with symbols)
and the coupled model (line) are compared for the same
amount of power input per unit time. The discussion of
the spectra revolves around the typical Lumley scale kc
which is determined by the condition

e1/2(kc)kc ≈ τ

−1 hP (B)i .

(9)

For kn ≫ kc the decay time τ becomes irrelevant for the
dynamics of Bn. The nonlinear interaction between un
and Bn at these scales results in both of them having
the same spectral exponent which is also the same as
that of the pure Sabra model. The amplitude of the
un spectrum is however smaller than that of the pure
Sabra in the coupled case, since the Bn ﬁeld adds to the
dissipation. On the other hand, for kn ≪ kc the Bn ﬁeld
is exponentially suppressed by its decay due to τ , and the
spectral exponent of un is again as in the pure Sabra.
Drag reduction comes about due to the interactions at
length scales of the order of kc which force a strong tilt in
the un spectrum there, causing it to cross the pure Sabra
spectrum, leading to an increase in the amplitude of the
energy containing scales. This is why the kinetic energy
is increasing for the same amount of power input, and

hence drag reduction. In Fig. 4 we show the spectrum of
energy dissipation k2
ne(kn). This ﬁgure indicates that as
far as the dissipative scale is concerned, it is not changed
much by the coupling of the velocity ﬁeld to the polymer
ﬁeld; both models show a maximum at n ∼ 14 which is
the dissipative scale. We now address the question how to
recapture the same phenomenon in a model involving the
velocity ﬁeld alone but with a scale-dependent eﬀective
viscosity. We ﬁrst reiterate that the ﬁeld un loses energy
in favor of the ﬁeld Bn. Using Eq. (5) we can measure
the energy transfer from un to Bn using the quantity:

Sp ≡

sp(kn) ≡

Re{iΣnu

This function measures the exchange between the kinetic
energy Σnu∗
nun and the “polymer” or “elastic” energy
ΣnB∗
nBn. In Fig. 5 we show a snapshot of the depen-
dence of the function Sp on time. The point to notice is
that Sp is negative for most of the time. The Bn ﬁeld
drains energy from the velocity ﬁeld, and we therefore can
hope to be able to capture its role by an eﬀective viscos-
ity. Note however that the dynamics of Sp is strongly
intermittent; this feature is common to the shell model
and the full FENE-P model as observed in the DNS of
the latter. We cannot hope to capture all the temporal
complexity with the notion of eﬀective viscosity, since
the latter is an average notion. Nevertheless the essen-
tial features will be shown to be reproduced. We will
try to capture the eﬀect of Sp in terms of an eﬀective
viscosity as follows: using h..i for the (time) average, we
introduce the scale dependent eﬀective viscosity νe(kn)

The quantity νe(kn) is shown in Fig. 6; its maximum is
reached at n ∼ 6−7, a wavenumber which is not yet in the
dissipative range. It is important to stress that νe(kn) is
obtained by averaging over a complex and intermittent
dynamical behavior of the viscoelastic shell model.
It
is therefore not obvious that the main characteristics of
drag reduction can be obtained by simply replacing the
viscoelastic terms Φn(B, B) by a scale dependent eﬀec-
tive viscosity. We demonstrate that this is possible by

using now the Sabra model with an extra viscous term
given by νe(kn)k2
nun. The new viscous term replaces, on
the average, the eﬀect of viscoelastic terms proportional
to Φn(B, B). The equations of motion read:

(12)

We do not expect that νe(kn) in the dynamics of the
Sabra model, as proposed in Eq. (12), will be exactly the
object measured on the average deﬁned in Eq. (11). We
clearly must keep the functional dependence of νe on kn,
but we can allow a factor of proportionally that will take
care of the diﬀerence between the dynamical intermittent
behavior and the average behavior. We will therefore use
the form ανe(kn), where α is a constant that can be op-
timized to achieve a close correspondence between the
two-ﬁeld model and the eﬀective one-ﬁeld model. For
α = 0 we recapture the original Sabra model without ef-
fective viscosity. We simulated the Sabra model with the
eﬀective viscosity [Eq. (12)] for diﬀerent values of α in the
range (0, 1). Drag reduction was found in all cases. For
α = 0.3 the energy spectrum turns out to be very close
to the original SabraP model with the viscoelastic terms.
In Fig. 7 we show the energy spectrum of the SabraP
model and the energy spectrum of the Sabra model with
eﬀective viscosity for α = 0.3.
In order to check that
the result shown in Fig. 7 are due to a scale dependent
dissipation, we have deﬁned a scale independent viscosity
ν∗ as:

The deﬁnition of ν∗ is similar to that given in Eq. (11),
i.e. ν∗ is deﬁned such that, by adding a viscous term

is losing the same amount of energy as in the case of

The corresponding energy spectrum is shown in Fig. 8
together with the energy spectrum for the Sabra model
(viscosity νs) and the Sabra model with the eﬀective vis-
cosity 0.3νe(kn). As one can clearly see, an increase of
the dissipation for all scales does not result in a drag
reduction. Finally, we have computed the energy ﬂux
of the Sabra model with eﬀective dissipation and com-
pared it against the energy ﬂux of the SabraP model.
This comparison is exhibited in Fig. 9 where the solid
line corresponds to the SabraP model and the symbols
correspond to the Sabra model with eﬀective dissipation
0.3νe(kn). The two energy ﬂuxes are equal in the inertial
range up to wavenumber n ∼ 7.

The results illustrated so far support the conclusion
that a scale dependent eﬀective viscosity is able to re-
produce most of the dynamics of viscoelastic terms and,
in particular, the phenomenon of drag reduction. Let us
remark once more, that it is the scale dependence of the
eﬀective viscosity which is able to properly reproduce the
drag reduction. It is worthwhile to explain the mecha-
nism of the action of the scale dependent viscosity, to
understand its similarity to the action of the polymers.
For ﬁxed energy input, as in our case, drag reduction
is shown as an increase of the rms ﬂuctuations at scales
larger than the Lumley scale. The scale dependent ef-
fective viscosity increases the viscous terms k2
nun in a
particular range of scales, say for nc < n < n2, where
nc = log2(kc). The energy ﬂux Πn in the system is given
by the third order correlation function
nun+1

. As shown in the Fig. 9, we
can safely assert that the energy ﬂux does not change for
n < nc. The increase of viscosity at n = nc produces a
decrease of the energy at scale nc. Thus, we expect unc to
decrease with respect to the value observed in the Newto-
nian case. Since Πn is not aﬀected by the increase of the
viscosity at n = nc, we must conclude that the quantity
un−1un should increase while unc decreases. This is the
origin of the tilt in the An increase of un spectrum in the
vicinity of nc. From a physical point of view, this picture
is not diﬀerent from the one discussed in [9] where a simi-
lar explanation for the drag reduction was invoked. Note
that all that we need for the phenomenon to occur is that
the increase in viscosity should start at the right scale.
This scale is equivalent of the Lumley scale whose role in
the viscoelastic case had been already emphasized.

concentration decreases, the eﬀective viscosity decreases,
and its peak migrates to higher values of kn. This mi-
gration is simply due to the change in the Lumley scale,
cf.. Eq. (9). The decrease in the eﬀective viscosity is due
to the increase in hP (B)i shown in Fig. 3. Needless to

In [9] it was shown that the conditions are optimal for
drag reduction in our shell model when a dimensionless
parameter µ ≡ λT kc, is of the order of unity. On the

Obviously, when k0 → 0 the overall kinetic energy in-

Thus k0 → 0 leads to λT → ∞, and we expect to lose

values of kc/k0 the eﬀective dissipation is just increasing
the overall viscosity in the system and, therefore, no drag
reduction can be observed. For drag reduction to occur
we must have the Lumley scale close to energy contain-
ing scales. Note, however, that “close” in our case means
kc ∼ 50 − 100 larger than the integral scale k0.

It is interesting to compare our ﬁndings, which pertain
to homogeneous systems, to drag reduction in turbulent
boundary layers. The elastic layer in such ﬂows (between
the viscous layer and the Newtonian plug) has the pe-
culiar distinction that y, the distance from the wall, be-
comes the only important scale in the problem. It is both
the energy containing scale and the Lumley scale at the
same time. The former is clear; at distance y from the
wall the most energetic eddies are of size y. The latter
needs a bit of theory, and this is provided in [18]. The
upshot of the analysis there is that in the elastic layer the
kinetic energy K(y) scales like K(y) ∼ y2/τ 2. Thus the
Lumley scale is also y. Accordingly, the phenomenon of
drag reduction is totally indiﬀerent to the physical size
of the channel (or pipe). As long as the conditions for
drag reduction hold at distance y from the wall, drag
reduction will occur and will have a persistent eﬀect on
the mean ﬂow independently of the outer scale. Even-
tually, when y is large enough, K(y) may stop growing
like y2, the Lumley scale decreases, and we observe cross
over back to the Newtonian log layer, albeit shifted to a
larger value of a mean velocity proﬁle.

In summary, drag reduction phenomena in homoge-
neous and wall bounded ﬂows have a lot in common even
though the eﬀect disappears in the former when the sys-
tem size goes to inﬁnity. The essential physics is the
proximity of the Lumley scale to the energy containing
scales, which allows an eﬀective interaction between the

polymer dynamics and the hydrodynamic modes.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The work presented in this paper supports two con-
clusions. First, we demonstrated that drag reduction by
polymers can be represented in terms of an eﬀective scale
dependent viscosity. One can use a theory in which two
ﬁelds are explicitly presented, i.e. the velocity ﬁeld and
the polymer ﬁeld. Then the viscosity remains Newto-
nian, and the polymer conformation tensor acts as the
additional sink of energy at the intermediate scales which
are larger than the viscous scales but smaller than the
Lumley scale. We can construct however eﬀective mod-
els in which only the velocity ﬁeld is present, and replace
the polymer ﬁeld by an eﬀective viscosity. This eﬀec-
tive viscosity will be diﬀerent from the Newtonian one at
the crucial scales at which the polymers are active, i.e.
scales larger than the dissipative scales but smaller than
the Lumley scale. With a properly chosen eﬀective vis-
cosity we can reproduce the results of the two-ﬁeld theory
qualitatively and even semi-quantitatively. Having done
so, we reach a uniﬁed discussion of drag reduction by
polymers in homogeneous and wall bounded ﬂows. It is
worth pointing out however that the uniﬁed discussion is
deeper than the device of uniﬁed viscosity. Superﬁcially
drag reduction in homogeneous and wall bounded tur-
bulence appear very diﬀerent. In the former there is no
mean ﬂow and drag reduction appears as an increase of
the rms ﬂuctuations of the large scales. In the latter drag
reduction means the increase of the mean ﬂow velocity.
Nevertheless in essence the phenomenon of drag reduc-
tion in homogeneous and wall bounded ﬂows is basically
the same: the polymers act to reduce the gradients at the
intermediate scales. They partly laminarize the ﬂow at
the intermediate scales, and this allows the largest scales
to attain higher rms ﬂuctuation levels (in homogeneous
ﬂows) or higher mean velocity (in wall bounded ﬂows).
To understand this further recall that for laminar ﬂows
the drag is a strongly decaying function of Re. Once tur-
bulence sets in, the dramatic increase in eddy viscosity
contributes to a drag which is much larger than the one
that would obtain in a hypothetical laminar ﬂow with
the same value of Re. The addition of polymers allows
one to bring the drag closer to the hypothetical laminar
low value, and this is done by reducing the turbulence
level at intermediate scales. Whether one prefers to de-
scribe the quantitative aspects of this phenomenon using
explicitly the polymer ﬁeld or by employing an eﬀective
viscosity depends to a large extent on one’s goals. We ex-
pect that the concept of eﬀective viscosity will be found
equally useful in discussing drag reduction in other situa-
tions, for example when microbubbles are used instead of
polymers. The quantitative aspects of such a description
need however to be worked out case by case, and this is
our program for the near future.

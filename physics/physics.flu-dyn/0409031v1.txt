(Received 20 February 2014)

The stability of a non-ohmic/ohmic ﬂuid interface in the presence of a constant gravita-
tional ﬁeld and stressed by a vertical stationary electric ﬁeld with unipolar injection is
studied, focusing on the destabilizing action of the electric pressure when charge relax-
ation eﬀects can be ignored. We use a hydraulic model, whose static equilibrium condition
is written and analysed as a function of the ohmic ﬂuid conductivity when subjected to
a non-linear perturbation. The combined action of the polarization and free interfacial
charges on the pressure instability mechanism is also analysed. The results show some
important peculiarities of the ﬂuid interface behaviour in the presence of a stationary
space charge distribution generated by unipolar injection in the non-ohmic ﬂuid.

1. Introduction

If a stationary electric ﬁeld E, parallel to a constant gravitational ﬁeld g, is applied
on a system composed by two immiscible ﬂuids with diﬀerent mass density, the interface
between them should rest, in the state of equilibrium, completely plane perpendicularly
to the ﬁelds and eventually subjected to the destabilization when the corresponding
electric ﬁeld is strong enough. In general, in this paper, the term non-ohmic/ohmic for
example refers to an interface where the lower ﬂuid layer is ohmic.

Taylor & McEwan (1965) studied the static equilibrium of such a system in the case
of a non-conducting/ conducting ohmic interface and determined the instability criterion
in a linear theory. Melcher & Smith Jr. (1969) studied the stability of an ohmic/ohmic
interface stressed by a vertical electric ﬁeld in a more general linear theory considering all
possible conductivity values of both ﬂuids (and also other physical properties involved,
such as viscosity, etc.), including charge relaxation eﬀects under these conditions. In
this work, shear stresses are involved and thus overstability (Chandrasekhar 1961) and
surface charge convection may occur. We say that in this case the instability is due to
the ”convective” mechanism. (Please note that in this case convection is due to surface
charge not to volume charge, like in the electrohydrodynamic instability due to unipolar
injection in an insulating liquid layer (Atten & Moreau 1972)).

Some recent work on this problem has investigated a non-ohmic/ohmic ﬂuid interface
when the non-ohmic layer is subjected to unipolar injection (Atten & Koulova-Nenova
1999; Vega & P´erez 2002a). In certain experimental systems an electrode may act not
only as a voltage source (a surface charge source, in the end) but also as a space charge
source (Atten & Moreau 1972). Melcher & Schwarz Jr. (1968), noticed that an electrode
may cause, if in contact with a very low conducting ﬂuid, dielectrical breakage and

generate a stationary electric ﬁeld with a space charge distribution in the non-ohmic
part of the system. This makes the coupling with the mechanical ﬂuid equations very
diﬀerent from that occurring in the classical studies of ohmic/ohmic ﬂuid interfaces. A
clear example is the experiment by Koulova-Nenova, Malraison & Atten (1996), where a
moderate injection in a liquid mixture of ciclohexane with TiAP salt (Denat 1982) was
produced. They observed that unipolar injection from the electrode may produce not
only bulk convection but also an interfacial instability similar to that in the absence of
space charge observed by Taylor & McEwan (1965) but with a peculiarity: the voltage
thresholds for instability are systematically reduced by 2/3. The complete linear theory
for a non-ohmic/ohmic interface is presented in the previous work by Vega & P´erez
(2002a), where a transition region has been found in the critical behaviour of the interface.
This region marks the conducting-to-insulating transition in the behaviour of the non-
ohmic/ohmic interface. In fact, the existence of this transition region implies that the
dynamics of the same non-ohmic/ohmic interface subjected to unipolar injection may
behave like in an ohmic/ohmic interface in which the lower layer is the most conducting,
but also like in an ohmic/ohmic interface in which the lower layer is the least conducting
(insulating behaviour), even though, by deﬁnition, in the non-ohmic/ohmic interface the
lower layer is always the most conducting. The apparent contradiction comes from the
fact that, under unipolar injection, the electric conduction in the non-ohmic layer may
be actually more ”eﬀective” than the ohmic conduction in the lower layer, depending on
the value of the applied electric potential. This causes the mechanics of the ﬂuid interface
be much more complex when there is injection.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this complexity appears already in
the static pressure instability mechanism; i.e., the static interfacial equilibrium between
electric and gravitational forces. In order to make clear an intuitive visualization of this
equilibrium, a hydraulic model is developed (ﬁgure 1). The system described in the model
is not exactly that of an inﬁnite ﬂuid interface, but as it will be shown when the initial
deformation of the interface has an inﬁnite characteristic wavelength, i.e. the perturba-
tion tends to disturb the interface only in the vertical direction, the model reproduces the
exact linear criterion of the static instability in the purely ohmic model when the charge
relaxation times are negligible. In the case of a non-ohmic/ohmic interface, the model
reproduces the exact linear criterion for inﬁnite characteristic wavelength (Vega & P´erez
2002a) only in the two limiting cases of a high or low conducting ohmic layer. For in-
termediate conductivities an additional term (coming from the existence of the space
charge distribution in the non-ohmic layer) that is lacking in the hydraulic model pro-
duces results that diﬀer from the criterion for an inﬁnite plane interface. Nevertheless,
it can account for the same transition region described above and demonstrates that
this transition may be observed as a function of the perturbation amplitude. As we will
see this implies that, once the instability begins, an interface with a very conducting
lower layer may be stabilized in states with non-zero perturbation amplitudes. This be-
haviour diﬀers from that observed in the purely ohmic case (Taylor & McEwan 1965;
Koulova-Nenova et al. 1996), where the interfacial perturbation grows continually be-
cause the electrical pressure mechanism is always active pulling up or pushing down the
interface.

The interest of this problem is due to the original behaviour of this putative ﬂuid
interface and its possible industrial applications. For example, the formation of stable
metallic liquid points when the interface changes from conducting (the electric pressure
has opposite sign to the applied ﬁeld) to non-conducting behaviour (the electric pressure
keeps the same sign that the applied ﬁeld) in a perturbed state could be used to make
ion sources.

Figure 1. The system studied. A plane perturbation of amplitude η is introduced in such a
way that the interface level is raised in the cylinder centered in x = 0 and lowered in the other
cylinder (which is centered at x = λ/2).

The possibility of producing ion sources by manipulating a ﬂuid interface with electric
ﬁelds motivated the work by N´eron de Surgy (1995), who extended the original work by
Taylor & McEwan (1965) introducing a non-linear perturbation in a non-conducting/conducting
ohmic ﬂuid interface, but always without injection. The results proved theoretically that
a metallic liquid can never develop stable points, independently of the geometry of the
system. However, in some rare cases he observed stable metallic points, which N´eron
indicated could be due to impurities in the liquid. We suggest in this paper that this is
related to an injection from the metallic liquid points to the air.

The intuitive framework provided by the hydraulic model makes possible the detection
of the stabilizing eﬀect due to the action of polarization interfacial charges when combined
with free surface charges. This is an eﬀect which has remained unsolved up to now because
of the complex formulation required to study the problem of the stability of the ﬂuid
interface. The eﬀect of the combined action of polarization and free surface charges will
be explained in

2.1. The system and the equilibrium equation

The system shown in ﬁgure 1, with two identical rigid cylinders with parallel axes, con-
nected to each other through a thin horizontal cylindrical pipe at their base. The system
is in a constant gravitational ﬁeld with a constant acceleration g = guz (this ﬁeld acts
in a direction called ”vertical”, thus its perpendicular plane deﬁnes the horizontal di-
rections). The system is immersed in a ﬂuid u, which supplies a constant pressure on
another ﬂuid (we call it ﬂuid l ), which is denser than ﬂuid u. Both ﬂuids are immiscible
and incompressible, so in the equilibrium state the ﬂuid l layer is below the other one.
The radius r of the horizontal thin pipe is large enough to allow a negligible Poiseuille
eﬀect for any typical ﬂuid velocity (i.e., 8µlv/r2
1, where µ is the dynamic viscosity, l
is the pipe length and v the ﬂuid velocity) and thus the pressure from a vertical cylinder
is completely communicated to the other one. The length of the system (L + d) is much

≪

4

lower than the horizontal dimensions of the cylinders so the boundary eﬀects are negli-
gible. There is a pair of horizontal rigid electrodes in each cylinder, one at the top of the
cylinder, and the other at its base. The upper electrodes (at z =
L) are connected to
the same DC voltage source, where a voltage V is applied, while the lower electrodes (at
z = d) are grounded. Additionally, if ﬂuid u is non-ohmic, a space charge source at the
upper electrodes injects unipolar volume charge q0 at z =

L.

and denote it as < A >= Al(F (r))

ﬂuid velocity v, although in our system coordinate y may be ignored.

Tv is the viscous stress tensor for incompressible ﬂuids:

If the system is in equilibrium, the ﬂuid interface is horizontal and at the same level in
both cylinders (ﬁgure 1). In this situation all stresses at the interface are in the vertical
direction and we have v = 0 and
uz = 0. Then the normal stress balance

When a plane perturbation is introduced in the system, the interface level is raised
by an amount η in one cylinder (the one at x = λ/2) and lowered by the same amount
η in the other. The perturbation is kept by some pressure source until the electric ﬁeld
becomes stationary. In this point, we still have v = 0 and
uz = 0. Now the
pressure source stops and the system is left under the action of gravitational and electric
pressures. It is implicit in the way in which the perturbation is introduced that charge
relaxation may be ignored and that condition (2.3) is still fulﬁlled. We express now the
pressure as a function of the scalar ﬁeld Π, which is deﬁned by the relation: Π = p

and that we call ”excess over the hydrostatic pressure”. Using this deﬁnition, we have

2.2. The hydraulic model and the question of the linear stability of an inﬁnite plane

ﬂuid interface

In the classical situation of an inﬁnite plane ﬂuid interface stressed by a vertical stationary
electric ﬁeld, several mechanisms may simultaneously induce an electrohydrodynamic
instability. The idea is to determine in which situations the electric pressure is the most
relevant and then to study separately its behaviour. Two questions can be raised: 1) are
there situations in this system in which the electric pressure is the only active instability
mechanism?; and 2) if so, can the hydrostatic model account for the linear instability
threshold values?

Concerning to question 1) Vega & P´erez (2002a) demonstrated that the electric pres-
sure is the unique destabilizing mechanism involved when an initial perturbation with
inﬁnite wavelength was produced. Although it is not the purpose of this work to analyse
the required conditions for a long wavelength instability to occur, this is always pos-
sible in the present problem if capillary forces are strong enough (Taylor & McEwan
1965) and in the case of a non-ohmic/ohmic interface if the non-ohmic ﬂuid has a very
high ionic mobility (Vega & P´erez 2002a). In the case of a long wavelength instability
and concerning to question 2) the answer is yes, although not always. This is because
in the hydrostatic model is not taken into account the variation of the pressure in the
horizontal. This can be shown if the linear perturbation of Navier-Stokes equation term
for horizontal components x, y are considered. Given the symmetry of the system, it is
enough to analyse the x component:

where q is the free space charge in the equilibrium state, and δφ and δp are the electric
potential and the total pressure linear perturbations in a very slightly deformed interface,
while δvx is the x component of the velocity linear perturbation.

(cid:19)

Integrating this equation in x and taking into account that δvx = 0 in the limit of long
wavelength (Vega & P´erez 2002a), when the jump at the interface is taken the following
relation is obtained:

(2.11)

In the case of an ohmic/ohmic interface the additional term is always zero because
no volume charges are present (q = 0), which means that the hydraulic model yields
the exact linear criterion for an inﬁnite plane interface in the limit of long wavelength.
However, in the non-ohmic/ohmic interface this term is not zero except in the cases of a
, and a non-conducting ohmic ﬂuid, σl = 0, where
perfect conducting ohmic ﬂuid, σl =
is
the interface is an equipotential, and δφ = 0. In general, the additional term
needed to obtain the exact criterion for an inﬁnite and initially plane non-ohmic/ohmic
interface. Nevertheless, the stability condition (2.6) not only describes essentially in a
non-ohmic/ohmic interface under unipolar injection the instability regions as a function
of the ohmic conductivity but also the linear criterion threshold value, as we will see in
4.

For shorter characteristic wavelengths capillary forces are involved but the present
analysis is useful as an estimation of the instability linear threshold when overstability
is not possible, because the inﬂuence of capillary forces is much weaker than that of the
electric pressure (Taylor & McEwan 1965). In addition, this study provides an intuitive
description on the mechanical process that occurs at the interface due to the action of
electric pressure for ﬁnite perturbations. In the limit of inﬁnite wavelength, the normal
stress balance (and hence, condition 2.6) gives the instability criterion, as shear stresses
are zero.

white arrows indicate the action of electrical pressure jump while black arrows indicate the

ﬂow in (b) from the left cylinder to the right cylinder is 2 hρi gη (or 2ξ in reduced magnitudes).

Typical critical curves UN L(ξ) are represented in ﬁgures 4(a) and 5. In these curves
stable and unstable regions are delimited by the function UN L(ξ) and the behaviour
of UN L(ξ) provides information about the evolution of the perturbation once it is in-
troduced. An increasing UN L(ξ) in ξ0 (∂U (ξ0)/∂ξ > 0) means that the perturbation

will not tend to increase for an applied potential V = U
N L (ξ0), because for ξ > ξ0,

pressure). And viceversa, a decreasing UN L in ξ0 means that the perturbation will tend

to increase if V = U
1/2
N L (ξ0) the perturbation will tend to decrease if ∂2UN L(ξ0)/∂ξ2 > 0 and to
for V = U
increase if ∂2UN L(ξ0)/∂ξ2 < 0. In deﬁnitive, if ∂UN L(ξ0)/∂ξ > 0 (or if ∂U (ξ0)/∂ξ = 0,
∂2UN L(ξ0)/∂ξ2 < 0) it may be said that ”stabilization” of the perturbation occurs at
1/2
N L (ξ0) and the point ξ = ξ0 may be considered as a new stable interface position
V = U
point, that is diﬀerent to the trivial solution ξ = 0 of the initial equilibrium state. We
call these points ”perturbed stable states” and as we will see they are only present in the
non-ohmic/ohmic interface.

2.4. An intuitive framework

The static equilibrium of the interface is given by the opposition of a gravitational term
and an electric term. As in a perturbed state the gravitational term always acts towards
the part of the system with a lower thickness of the heavier ﬂuid layer, then an analysis
case by case of the sense of action of the electric pressure jump proceeds. The dimen-
sionless electric pressure jump in the interface can be written in the general form, valid
for all ﬂuids independently of their regime of electric conduction:

In a perturbed state, the magnitude Σ gets in general a value Σ− in the cylinder with
a minimum interface elevation and another value Σ+ in the cylinder with maximum ele-
vation. But, in order to highlight the combined action of polarization and free interfacial
charges, let us suppose that the process is such that Σ keeps constant. This is always
possible if Σ is considered to be one of the constant parameters of the system instead of
the physical conduction property of one of the ﬂuids (for example, the ohmic conductivity
if there is one ohmic ﬂuid). In this case, the interface is not a physical (or real) interface,
as its physical properties are let to vary in order to keep Σ constant, but this procedure
will be very useful in order to classify, for all interfaces, the possible types of pressure
instability mechanisms.

When the perturbation is introduced, a gravitational pressure term appears and an
electrical pressure term acting against it is needed in order to sustain such perturbation.
There are two special cases in which is not possible from the start, as the left hand term
in (2.14) is null. In eﬀect, in the case Σ = √εl it is evident, from (2.12), that each one

Figure 2(a) represents the initial unperturbed state when both, the electrical pressure
jump and the total interfacial charge are positive (Σ < √εl, Σ < 1). We consider the case
of a system where El(zs) decreases with the l layer thickness. If a plane perturbation
is introduced, the gravitational pressure acts against it by communicating an upwards
pressure to the zone with minimum interface elevation (see ﬁgure 2b). Now the electric
pressure jump (2.12) is higher in the zone with a lower interface height as the thickness
of the lower ﬂuid layer has decreased . Conversely, in the zone of maximum elevation the
electric pressure jump decreases. Thus, a net electric pressure ﬂux appears towards the
left cylinder in ﬁgure 2(b). If the diﬀerence of electrical pressure jump at both cylinders
is high enough, the restoring action of the gravitational pressure will be counterbalanced.
This is possible if the applied potential is higher than a critical value Vc, given by the
stability condition (2.6).

On the contrary (ﬁgure 3a), if the electrical pressure jump becomes negative while
the total interfacial charge keeps positive (1 > Σ > √εl), then the electric pressure
jump (2.12) in the zone of minimum elevation decreases (it becomes more negative),
while in the zone of maximum elevation it increases (decreases in magnitude), so the
perturbation is damped. Besides, the action of interfacial charges tends now to enhance
even more the stabilization (ﬁgure 3b). The same analysis may be carried out when
Σ > 1 and El(zs) increases with the l layer thickness, so ﬁnally two stable regions are
found: 1 > Σ > √εl and √εl > Σ > 1 when El(zs) behaves as assumed. If we analyse
further these conditions for stabilization we can see that when this occurs the interfacial
free charge Q = (εl −
Σ)El(zs) always takes opposite sign to the total interfacial charge
Q takes the sign of Qt. Then,
Q and consequently the polarization charge Qp = Qt −
the stabilization is due to the action of polarization interfacial charges Qp. This idea
turns out evident when the electric pressure jump is written as a function of polarization
and free interfacial charges. The contribution of the free surface charges to the electrical
pressure jump has the same sign of the total interfacial charge term:

In an ohmic/ohmic interface Σ is a constant and El(zs) always decreases with the l
layer thickness for Σ < 1 and always increases for Σ > 1, as supposed in the preceding
analysis, so given the conductivities and permittivities of the ﬂuids, the interface may
be stable respect to the pressure instability mechanism for any value of the electric ﬁeld,
if 1 > Σ > √εl or √εl > Σ > 1. If the interface is non-ohmic/ohmic El(zs) behaves
with the l layer thickness mostly like in the ohmic/ohmic case (it may manifest more
complex behaviours, though, see (Vega & P´erez 2002a)) but, as we will see in
4, Σ is a
function of the electric ﬁeld and it is always possible for a real interface to ﬁnd ranges
of the electric ﬁeld for which Σ lies out of the stable intervals. This is the reason for
the appearance in a non-ohmic/ohmic interface of a stable region around the intervals
1 > Σ > √εl or √εl > Σ > 1 with a non-dimensional formulation and its disappearance
in the dimensional formulation in a previous work (Vega & P´erez 2002a).

3. Ohmic/ohmic interface

In the case of two ohmic ﬂuids with conductivities σu, σl, and taking σu as unit for
electric conductivity, the dimensionless expressions for the stationary electric ﬁelds and
Σ (taking into account that the density current j is stationary: ju = jl = j, Eu = σlEl)
in the unperturbed state are the following:

El = Vl

Eu = Vu/L

Σ = σl

being Vl and Vu the electric potential drop through the lower and upper ﬂuid layers inside
the cylinders. As the perturbation is plane, the ﬁelds in the perturbed state are:

where the upper signs stand for the magnitudes evaluated at x = 0 and the lower signs
stand for the magnitudes at x = λ/2.

Using V = Vu+ + Vl+ = Vu− + Vl−, we obtain:

4. Non-ohmic/ohmic interface

4.1. Equations
Let us suppose now that the ﬂuid ”u” is in non-ohmic regime of electric conduction and
the ﬂuid ”l” is in ohmic regime. If there is a unipolar space charge source in the upper
electrode, a unipolar space charge distribution is induced in the non-ohmic ﬂuid, in which
qu;
the conduction (in dimensional magnitudes) is expressed by ju = qu(KuEu + v)
where Ku is the ionic mobility of non-ohmic ﬂuid and Du its diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The
diﬀusion term may usually be neglected (Atten & Moreau 1972), so in a state at rest
(v = 0) we have in our system that ju = KuquEu in the non-ohmic ﬂuid. We take now
g/d as unit for electric conductivity, being Ku the ionic mobility of the air.

4.4. Non-linear transition from conducting regime to low conducting regime

From the analysis in the previous sections, we have demonstrated that the non-linear cri-
terion for the non-conductor and perfect conductor is minimum when the perturbation
amplitude is maximum, which means that once the instability is set on, evolves up to the
maximum perturbation amplitude. The diﬀerence between both limits comes from the
fact that while in the perfect conductor the instability is due to an upward electric pres-
sure, in the non-conductor limit the instability is driven by a downward electric pressure.
Since in the non-ohmic/ohmic interface Σ is a function of the electric ﬁeld, it seems clear
that between the perfect conductor and the non-conductor behaviour there should be
intermediate behaviours, corresponding to ﬂuid interfaces with intermediate conductivi-
ties whose electric pressure jump may pass from being upward (Σ > √εl) to downward
(Σ < √εl) depending on the value of ξ (that modiﬁes the electric ﬁeld). It should be
possible to think in these cases of an instability that evolves without reaching the maxi-
mum perturbation amplitude; i.e, this should indicate that ”perturbed stable states” are
possible. This is related to the existence of certain intervals of ξ in which ∂UN L/∂ξ > 0 as
2.4. In eﬀect, if the function UN L(ξ) (or, equivalently UN L(ξ)1/2)

§

We saw in the linear theory for an inﬁnite plane interface that there may exist multiple
instability threshold values for a given conductivity (Vega & P´erez 2002a). This is in
agreement with the hydraulic model because if we decrease further the conductivity,
three solutions at ξ = 0 begin to appear (ﬁgure 5c). Two of them enclose an unstable
region which should correspond with the high conducting regime-like instability while
the third one corresponds to the low conducting mechanism. The two solutions enclosing
the unstable region get nearer as the conductivity is decreased (ﬁgure 5d ). Finally, for
lower conductivities a unique solution at ξ = 0, which corresponds to the non-conductor
limit of (4.16). The value of Σ (4.6) can be used to determine the corresponding pressure
mechanism.

The eﬀect of increasing the permittivity (i.e., increasing the polarization interfacial charges in

completely analogous to those of the dimensional representation in the linear theory of a
previous work (Vega & P´erez 2002a). The critical curve at higher values of σl in ﬁgure 6)
corresponds to the conducting mechanism (upward electric pressure jump) and the other
curve corresponds to the low conducting mechanism (downward electric pressure jump).
Unlike the ohmic/ohmic case, the eﬀect of polarization charges does not forbid the long
wave instability for any conductivity value, because there is always at least one criti-
cal value, corresponding to the low conducting mechanism). Concretely, the polarization
charges make the high conducting instability mechanism be produced at higher conduc-
tivities (ﬁgure 6). The curves in ﬁgures 5 and 6, obtained with the equilibrium condition
(2.6) are analogous to those in the previous work by Vega & P´erez (2002a), showing that
the long wave instability in an inﬁnite plane interface is essentially determined by (2.6).

5. Conclusions

The action of polarization charges may inhibit the instability pressure mechanism in an
ohmic/ohmic interface if 1 > σl > √εl or √εl > σl > 1; i.e., the total surface charge and
the electric pressure jump at the interface have opposite signs. This eﬀect has not been
formerly detected. In the non-ohmic/ohmic interface the eﬀect of polarization charges
does not forbid the pressure instability mechanism for any value of σl but makes the
conducting critical curve appear at higher values of σl.

The hydraulic model reproduces linear critical values of the long wavelength instability
in the case of an ohmic/ohmic inﬁnite interface and also in the non-ohmic/ohmic interface
in the limits of both perfect conducting and very low conducting ohmic ﬂuid. This model
also reproduces the transition region in the pressure instability mechanism in a non-
ohmic/ohmic interface (Vega & P´erez 2002a). The behaviour of the parameter UN L (or
1/2
N L ) as a function of the perturbation amplitude reveals the existence of perturbed stable
U
states (which are diﬀerent to the trivial solution of the initial equilibrium state ξ = 0).
These new stable states are only found in the non-ohmic/ohmic interface, suggesting the
possibility of interfacial dynamics very diﬀerent to those detected in systems without
injection (Taylor & McEwan 1965; Melcher 1963; Melcher & Smith Jr. 1969). This could
be related to the observations by N´eron de Surgy (1995) of stable metallic points. In

Non-linear plane perturbation in a non-ohmic/ohmic ﬂuid interface

17

any case, a detailed study of the interfacial dynamics is needed in order to do a precise
determination of the situations in which the stabilization in perturbed states from any
initial state is possible.

It seems evident that the introduction of the injection enriches the behaviour of the
pressure equilibria in a ﬂuid interface, and also opens a way to stabilization and shape-
control of high conducting ﬂuid interfaces by applying stationary electric ﬁelds.

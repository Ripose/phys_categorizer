Abstract

We derive a relativistic hodograph equation for a two-dimensional
stationary isentropic hydrodynamical motion. For the case of stiﬀ mat-
ter, when the velocity of sound coincides with the light speed, the sin-
gularity in this equation disappears and the solutions become regular
in all hodograph plane.

The non-relativistic problem for two-dimensional stationary isentropic hy-
drodynamical motion was formulated and solved by Chaplygin in 1902 (see
[1]). The solution was based on a transformation from the physical (coordi-
nate) plane x1, x2 to the velocity plane v1, v2. This transformation is called
hodograph transformation. The beauty of this Chaplygin’s approach con-
sists in the fact that it allows to undertake a transition from two non-linear
hydrodynamical equations to one linear partial derivatives equation for a
potential in the hodograph plane.

Below we formulate and solve general stationary two-dimensional prob-
lem for the relativistic hydrodynamics. We use some results from the work by
Khalatnikov (1954) [2], where the general approach to the relativistic hydro-
dynamics was formulated and the general one-dimensional non-stationary
Chaplygin problem was solved.

To begin with let us introduce the variables: the relativistic velocity ui

such that1

the enthalpy per particle w and the particle density n [1, 2]. From the
quasi-potentiality condition [2] in the relativistic hydrodynamics

uiui = u2

4 = −1,

− u2

(1)

follows that for the potential ϕ:

wui =

∂ϕ
∂xi ,

dϕ = wu1dx1 + wu2dx2.

Let us make a Legendre transformation to the hodograph plane, going from
the variables x1 and x2 to the variables u1 and u2, and introducing the
potential

χ = ϕ − x1wu1 − x2wu2.
For the potential motion we write instead of the relativistic Euler equation
its ﬁrst integral, i.e. the Bernoilli equation [3, 2]

(4)

In the hodograph plane we introduce the “angles” η and θ such that

wu4 = const.

u1 = sinh η cos θ,
u2 = sinh η sin θ,
u3 = cosh η.

In these variables the diﬀerential of the potential χ is

dχ = −w[(x1 cos θ + x2 sin θ) cosh ηdη
+(−x1 sin θ + x2 cos θ) sinh ηdθ]
−(x1 cos θ + x2 sin θ) sinh ηdw.

Taking into account the Bernoilli relation (5) and omitting the normalization
factor we have

Note that these relations have the same form as their non-relativistic analogs

To get the equation for χ, we should meke in the preceding equation (13)

where the sound velocity c is deﬁned as [2]

The relativistic hodograph equation (14) together with Eqs. (10) play
a role of equations of motion. Thus, the problem of solution of nonlinear
equations of motion is reduced to the solution of the linear equation for χ
in the hodograph plane. However, the boundary conditions for Eq. (14) are
nonlinear (for details see [1]).

which consists in the appearance of the factor (1 − v2) in front of the term
∂2χ
∂v2 . Both these equations have a singularity at v = c which corresponds
a transition to the supersonic regime. The supersonic regime brings also
another problem, which is connected with the possible vanishing of the Ja-

which in the subsonic regime is always positive. Nulliﬁcation of this Jacobian
on some “limiting” line v = v(θ) in the supersonic regime makes the velocity
v complex on one side of this limiting line [1]. It signiﬁes that the appearance
of shock waves is unavoidable in this regime.

It is extremely interesting that these problems are absent for the relativis-
tic motion of a ﬂuid with the stiﬀ equation of state when pressure coincides
with energy density and the sound velocity coincides with the speed of light
(c = 1). In this case the factors (1 − v2) and
cancel each other.
Naturally, the supersonic regime seems to be impossible for the stiﬀ ﬂuid,
because such a regime would be also a superluminal one. Note, however,
that even considering supersonic/superluminal regime, we always have real
solutions of the Chaplygin equation and the potential and velocity cannot
become complex.

The consideration presented above can be treated as an introduction to
the further study of two-dimensional motion in the relativistic hydrodynam-
ics, which could have astrophysical and cosmological applications.

tunities to apply the described methods to the study of some astrophysical
problems.

Appendix.Some general remarks concerning the rel-
ativistic hydrodynamics

One-dimensional relativistic non-stationary Chaplygin problem was stud-
ied in paper by Khalatnikov [2]. This study was undertaken for further

4

development of the Landau-Fermi theory of high-energy multiple particle
production. Here, we would like to mention only its main results and write
down the relativistic non-stationary one-dimensional Chaplygin equation.

Starting with the quasi-potentiality condition (2) and introducing the

velocity components as

we undertake the Legendre transformation

u1 = sinh η, u4 = cosh η,

χ = ϕ − wu1x1 − wu4x4.

Acting as above we come to the equation

Using the expression (15) for the sound velocity and introducing a new
variable y = ln w, one gets the following equation
− ∂2χ

(21)

∂y2 + (1 − c2)

∂η2 = 0.

This equation represents a solution of the one-dimensional non-stationary
problem in relativistic hydrodynamics. As before it should be accompanied
by the choice of the special boundary conditions and by formulas, which
express the time and spatial coordinate variable as functions of the potential
χ:

Again, in the stiﬀ matter case c = 1, Eq. (21) simpliﬁes essentially and

becomes a simple one-dimensional wave equation.

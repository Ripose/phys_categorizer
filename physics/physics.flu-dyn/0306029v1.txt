(Dated: September 8, 2013)

Incompressible inviscid irrotational unsteady ﬂows with circulation Γ around a distorted toroidal
bubble are considered. A general variational principle is found that determines evolution of the
bubble shape. For a two-dimensional (2D) cavity with a constant area A, exact pseudo-diﬀerential
equations of motion are derived, based on variables that determine a conformal mapping of the unit
circle exterior into the region occupied by ﬂuid. A closed expression for the Hamiltonian of the
2D system in terms of canonical variables is obtained. When the gravity is small, gA3/2/Γ2 ≪ 1,
stability of the stationary drifting 2D hollow vortex is demonstrated. For circulation-dominated
regime of three-dimensional ﬂows a simpliﬁed Lagrangian is suggested, inasmuch as the bubble
shape is well described by the center-line R(ξ, t) and by approximately circular cross-section with
|R′|dξ)2. In particular, a ﬁnite-dimensional dynamical system is
relatively small area A(ξ, t) ≪ (
derived and approximately solved for a vertically moving axisymmetric vortex ring bubble with a
compressed gas inside.

INTRODUCTION

Toroidal bubbles with circulation can be created un-
der water in various ways, naturally or artiﬁcially [1],
and they are interesting objects both from experimen-
tal and theoretical points of view. Amazing examples
of natural beauty are vortex ring bubbles blown by dol-
phins for amusement. Also whales sometimes blow ring
bubbles that can reach several meters in diameter. Some-
times toroidal bubbles with circulation arise as the result
of gravity-induced topological transformation of a large,
initially spherical bubble (see, e.g., [2, 3] and references
therein). Such spherical bubble can be rapidly produced,
for instance, by an explosion deeply in water.

First attempts to describe analytically dynamics of
the vortex ring bubbles were made since a long time
ago (see [2, 4, 5], and references therein).
It is clear
that the most general and realistic theoretical considera-
tion should be based on the Navier-Stokes equation, and
thus is a very complicated nonlinear free-boundary prob-
lem in the three-dimensional (3D) space. However, in
many cases the inviscid approximation, based on the Eu-
ler equation, can give good results. Inviscid ﬂows belong
to the class of conservative dynamical systems and thus
are more easily studied by Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
methods [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. With these
methods, it is possible to considerably simplify the anal-
ysis and make it more compact, especially for irrotational
ﬂows, when the initially 3D problem becomes eﬀectively
2D, on the free surface [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

In this paper we consider the important question about

principle of the least action for a toroidal bubble. The
corresponding Lagrangian functional is shown to have,
besides quadratic (inertial) terms on generalized veloci-
ties, also gyroscopic terms (of the ﬁrst order on general-
ized velocities). The gyroscopic terms are proportional to
the constant circulation of the ﬂuid velocity along linked
contours. This property makes the toroidal bubble simi-
lar to a vortex ﬁlament, if the circulation is large.

Having a general variational formulation, we then de-
rive various approximations with reduced number of de-
grees of freedom. First of all, this is the exact reduction
corresponding to purely 2D ﬂows around a cavity. In this
case it is possible to express the Lagrangian in terms of
the so-called conformal variables [9, 10, 11]. For 3D ﬂows,
we do not have an exact explicit expression for the La-
grangian, but approximations are possible. Such approx-
imate dynamical systems take into account only most
relevant degrees of freedom of the original system. We
have obtained on this way an approximate Lagrangian
for a relatively long and thin toroidal bubble. For an ax-
ially symmetric rising and spreading vortex ring bubble
our variational approach gives a ﬁnite-dimensional ap-
proximate system that is a generalization of what was
discussed in [2].

II. VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLE FOR BUBBLES

A. Hamiltonian structure of equations of motion

It is well known fact that in the frame of ideal hydro-
dynamics the class of irrotational solutions exists. Such
solutions describe potential ﬂows with zero curl of the
velocity ﬁeld at any moment of time in the whole bulk
of moving ﬂuid. If the liquid is also incompressible (with
the unit density, for simplicity) then the investigation of

(2)

(3)

non-stationary irrotational ﬂows in a space region D with
the free surface Σ can be reduced to the consideration of
Hamiltonian dynamics of the surface [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
In such formulation, the shape of the surface Σ itself and
the boundary value Ψ of the velocity potential are the
dynamical variables determining the state of the system.
The velocity potential of incompressible ﬂuid satisﬁes the
Laplace equation in the bulk of the ﬂuid

In these equations ˙Σ is the speed of surface motion along
the normal unit vector n directed inside the bubble, Vn

the total time derivative of the boundary value of the
potential Ψ on moving surface [8, 12]. The (normalized
to the ﬂuid density) pressure P (

bubble (the gas is considered as approximately massless
and adiabatic) depends on the total volume of the bubble,

This expression is written in the invariant form that does
not depend on a choice of the parameterization of the
surface shape. Practically, such a choice is dictated by
geometry of a given problem. For instance, the parame-
terization z = η(x, y, t) is commonly used to study waves
on the sea surface. It is clear that due to the equality
˙Σ dS = ηt dxdy the functions η(x, y) and Ψ(x, y) form
the pair of canonically conjugated variables [7],[12]. But
if we want to study oscillations of a spherical bubble, the
spherical coordinates r, θ, ϕ are more convenient. In this

case the functions

Now we would like to give a simple example corre-
sponding to spherically symmetric ﬂows with g = 0 and
with a constant external pressure Pext.
In this case
the dynamical variables depend only on t, and we have

More complex spherical bubble dynamics with a time-
dependent Pext(t) is governed by the Lagrangian (10)
as well, however we do not have analytical solutions
for that case. For instance, the dependence Pext(t) =
P0 + Ps cos(ωt) is related to the problem of single bub-
ble sonoluminescence [18], where ω is the frequency of a
(relatively long) standing ultrasound wave.

2. Toroidal bubbles with circulation

The situation with variational formulation is more

complicated in the case when the free surface Σ : (ϑ, ξ)
7→
R = (X, Y, Z), with 0
ξ < 2π, is
topologically equivalent to a tor, and circulation of the
velocity along linked contours takes a nontrivial value Γ.
Now the potential Φ is a multi-valued function,

ϑ < 2π and 0

≤

≤

Φ = φ + (Γ/2π)θ,

(11)

where φ is the harmonic potential determined by a single-
valued boundary function ψ(ϑ, ξ), and the velocity ﬁeld
created by the multi-valued harmonic function θ has zero
normal component on the free surface. What is impor-
tant, the potential θ is completely determined by the
shape of toroidal bubble. The multi-valued boundary
function Θ(ϑ, ξ) associated with the potential θ increases
by the value 2π as the coordinate ϑ takes the increase 2π.
The kinetic energy of ﬂow can be represented as the sum

of circulation-induced energy and the energy associated
with a motion of the bubble. In a general form, we have
an expression as follows

In order to have correct equations of motion for

It is clear that this expression should be transformed by
some integration in parts to a form where Θ is not em-

single-valued functions. As the result, we derive that the
Lagrangian for a such hollow vortex tube can be written

2D HOLLOW VORTEX

As application of the above described theory, let us
ﬁrst consider a plain irrotational ﬂow with the circulation
Γ = 2πγ around a cavity of the ﬁnite area A = πr2. The
two-dimensional geometry allows us take advantage of
use of the conformal mappings theory for derivation of
exact equations of motion for such a system. Conformal
variables have been extensively used during last years
for analytical study of waves on the sea surface as well
as for their numerical simulations (see, for instance [9,
10, 11]). The system which is considered in this section
has a set of distinctions in comparison with the usual
surface waves. The presence of the circulation makes it
similar to a vortex. At the same time, the hollow vortex
possesses inertial properties and a potential energy in
the gravity ﬁeld. At small values of the parameter µ =
gr3/γ2 a stationary horizontal drift of the hollow vortex
gr2/(2γ) and with
is possible with the velocity Vd ≈ −
the shape close to circular. This motion is stable, as it is
shown below. Therefore the material of this section will
serve as a basis for further simpliﬁed description of 3D
circulation-dominated ﬂows.

A. Conformal mapping

Thus, we have the inﬁnite two-dimensional region D
which is topologically equivalent to the exterior of the
unit circle. Our purpose now is to obtain an expression
for the kinetic energy of the irrotational ﬂow with the
circulation 2πγ around the cavity in the case of arbitrary
given shape of the surface and arbitrary given boundary
Ψ + 2πγ after
potential Ψ (with the only condition Ψ
pass along the boundary). Strictly speaking, this energy
is inﬁnite because of divergence of the corresponding inte-
gral on the inﬁnity. But it is not important for equations

7→

4

of motion, inasmuch as presence of an inﬁnite constant
term in the Hamiltonian in no way inﬂuences the dynam-
ics. Therefore only an excess of the energy in comparison
with some basic state is needed. As the basic state, we
shall take the perfect circular shape of the boundary with
the radius r and purely azimuthal velocity ﬁeld, inversely
proportional to a distance from the central point.

As far as the velocity potential Φ satisﬁes the Laplace
equation which is conformally invariant, it is naturally to
re-formulate the problem in terms of conformal mapping
of the unit circle exterior into the region D. Such map-
ping is determined by an analytical function z(w, t) (it
should be noted that in this section z is obviously NOT
the third Cartesian coordinate). The function z(w, t) has
no singularities at
> 1 and behaves proportionally to
w on the inﬁnity. Therefore the expansion of this func-
tion in powers of w contains no positive powers higher
than 1. The shape of the free surface is given parametri-
cally by the expression

ponent of the velocity on free surface. The single-valued
function ψ is connected with evolution of the boundary
shape. It can be understood as potential of the surface
waves. The excess of energy is the sum of two parts. The
ﬁrst part is due to the kinetic energy of surface waves

Here ˙z = ∂tz, z′ = ∂ϑz. Besides obvious terms that were

mum of the circulational part of the Hamiltonian at the
perfect shape z = reiϑ + z0. To be punctual, we have
included also the terms with the Lagrangian multipliers

erties of the function z(ϑ).

The variation of the action with the Lagrangian (25)

B. Canonical variables

The Lagrangian (25) is written in terms of variables
that are not canonically conjugated. For convenience of
a nonlinear analysis a pair of canonical variables can be
found. As the canonical coordinate, we will take a real
function q(ϑ, t) such that

z(ϑ, t) = β(ϑ, t)eiϑ,

We see that regardless of the vortex size r and the
value of γ, all frequencies are real. From the other hand,
we naturally expect an instability for suﬃciently large
r and/or small γ. But there is no contradiction at this
point because for a large size and/or small circulation
the behavior of a coherent superposition of eigen-modes
with real frequencies is eﬀectively exponential at small
t. Therefore the linearized equations for small pertur-
bations become un-valid very soon and the nonlinearity
begins to play an essential role.

IV. 3D HOLLOW VORTEX TUBE

A. Simpliﬁed Lagrangian

Now we proceed to a simpliﬁed consideration of a 3D
thin and long closed hollow vortex tube with a smooth
center-line R(ξ, t) and with approximately circular cross-
Λ2, where
section having a relatively small area A(ξ, t)
Λ is the total length of the center-line,

Since for large enough circulation (Γ2
quasi-2D dynamics is stable with approximately circular
cross-section, and also for a straight thin 3D tube (Γ2 >
4π2σ(A/π)1/2, see [4]) it is easy to demonstrate stability

of longitudinal perturbations, such description should be
good in many cases.

Assuming slow variation of A(ξ, t) along the curve
R(ξ, t) and neglecting small distortions of the shape of
circular cross-section, we can give an explicit form to all
terms in Eqs.(15)-(16). As the result, a simpliﬁed La-
grangian can be written with a logarithmic accuracy as

Included into this Lagrangian are the most principal in-
ertial eﬀects that correspond to the dynamics of R(ξ, t)
and A(ξ, t) on scales of order Λ. Interplay between the
second order on time derivatives inertial terms and the
circulation-originated ﬁrst order terms will result in os-
cillations that are relatively fast if Γ is large. However,
in circulation-dominated regime this system has inter-
esting solutions with the oscillations almost not excited.
Approximately such non-oscillating solutions are deter-
mined by the Lagrangian without the inertial terms.
That means we have to ﬁnd a minimum of the eﬀec-
R(ξ), A(ξ)
tive potential energy Π
over A(ξ) with ﬁxed

R(ξ) and then substitute the minimum-providing conﬁg-
uration A0(ξ) into Π. The extremal conﬁguration A0(ξ)
is determined by the following coupled equations,

B. Axisymmetric motion

An obvious application of the Lagrangian (42) is for
vertically rising and spreading axisymmetric vortex ring
bubble [2]. We need only three degrees of freedom to de-
scribe such motion, namely the vertical coordinate Z(t),
the radius of the ring R(t) = (X 2 + Y 2)1/2, and the total
volume of the bubble
(t) = 2πA(t)R(t). The corre-
sponding ﬁnite-dimensional dynamical system is deter-
mined by the following Lagrangian,

This inequality makes constant-cross-area conﬁgurations

a vortex ring bubble violates this criterion in the course
of motion, then it will be destabilized by surface tension
and very soon development of the instability, together
with viscous eﬀects, will result in transformation of the
ring into a closed chain of smaller bubbles connected by

thin vortex ﬁlaments, as it is observed experimentally.
However, we found with realistic dependences
) that
the above described Hamiltonian evolution of a spread-
ing ring typically goes away from the instability. Thus,
to destroy the ring, preliminary viscous diﬀusion of the
vorticity seems to be necessary [2, 5] since it results in
slow decreasing of the circulation along a contour just
above the bubble surface. Finally this (eﬀective for the
instability) circulation becomes considerably less than Γ
and the ring comes to its end.

V. SUMMARY

In this work we have developed a variational ap-
proach for theoretical study of the ideal incompressible
irrotational ﬂows with a distorted toroidal bubble,
in
the case when the velocity potential is a multi-valued
function. Using this method, we have derived exact
pseudo-diﬀerential equations of motion for purely two-
dimensional ﬂows with circulation around a single cav-
ity. Also we have suggested a simpliﬁed Lagrangian for
a three-dimensional thin hollow vortex tube. As a sim-
ple particular case, the axisymmetric vertical motion of
a spreading vortex ring bubble with a compressed gas
inside has been considered. Approximate solutions of a
corresponding ﬁnite-dimensional dynamical system have
been obtained.

Lower branch coherent states in plane Couette ﬂow have an asymptotic structure that consists of
O(1) streaks, O(R−1) streamwise rolls and a weak sinusoidal wave that develops a critical layer, for
large Reynolds number R. Higher harmonics become negligible. These unstable lower branch states
appear to have a single unstable eigenvalue at all Reynolds numbers. These results suggest that
the lower branch coherent states control transition to turbulence and that they may be promising
targets for new turbulence prevention strategies.

Recent experiments indicate that the smallest ampli-
tude necessary to trigger transition to turbulence in pipe
ﬂow scales with the inverse of the Reynolds number R, at
least for a class of large scale perturbations [1, 2]. That
R−1 scaling, and other characteristics of the perturba-
tions, are shown here to be consistent with a class of un-
stable 3D traveling wave solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equation recently discovered in all canonical shear ﬂows
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. These new coherent solutions arise
through saddle-node bifurcations at R = Rsn. At that
onset Reynolds number, the solutions capture the form
and length scales of the coherent structures that have
long been observed in the near wall region of turbulent
shear ﬂows [6]. For R > Rsn, the solutions separate into
upper and lower branches. For relatively low R > Rsn,
a single traveling wave upper branch may capture the
key statistics of turbulent shear ﬂows remarkably well
[6, 9, 10]. Here it is shown that the lower branch so-
lutions in plane Couette ﬂow obey the R−1 scaling and
evidence is provided that these states form the ‘backbone’
of the phase space boundary separating the basin of at-
traction of the laminar ﬂow from that of the turbulent
ﬂow, and are therefore directly connected with transition
to turbulence [5, 6, 11].

Incompressible ﬂuid ﬂow is governed by the Navier-

Stokes equations

where v(r, t) is the ﬂuid velocity at point r and time
t ≥ 0, p(r, t) is the mechanical pressure that enforces in-
compressibility and R > 0 is the Reynolds number which
is a non-dimensionalized inverse viscosity. The mean ﬂow
is in the ex direction in a channel with parallel walls at
y = ±1. Plane Couette ﬂow (PCF) is driven by the mo-
tion of these walls so v = ±ex at y = ±1, for all x, z, t, in
which case v = yex is the laminar solution of (1). That
solution is linearly stable for all R > 0 [12]. Periodic
boundary conditions are imposed in the wall-parallel di-

Symmetric lower branch traveling waves in plane Cou-
ette ﬂow (for which c = 0) have been continued to high
R by Newton’s method as in [3, 4, 6]. Figure 1 shows the
scaling of the amplitudes of the various elements con-
stituting such solutions as functions of R. The streaks
u0(y, z) − u(y) tend to a non-zero constant while the am-
plitude of the rolls (0, v0(y, z), w0(y, z)) scales like 1/R as
R → ∞. The fundamental mode v1(y, z) has an approx-
imate R−0.9 scaling, while the 2nd and 3rd harmonics
scale approximately like R−1.6 and R−2.2 respectively.
Higher harmonics decay faster and are not shown. This
separation between the harmonics suggests that the 2nd
and higher harmonics become insigniﬁcant for large R.
Indeed, the solution was continued beyond R = 6168
by dropping all harmonics with no signiﬁcant change
(none detectable on ﬁg. 1). This is unusual: as R is in-
creased, the numerical resolution can be decreased in the
x-direction. This is only true for the continuation of the
lower branch solutions, and the catch is that the struc-
ture of the lower branch in the (y, z)-plane becomes more
complex because the fundamental v1 develops a critical

layer, as discussed hereafter.

Figure 2 illustrates the structure of the lower branch
steady state. The streaky ﬂow u0(y, z) and the rolls
(0, v0, w0) remain large scale and their structure becomes
independent of R; v0 has a simple updraft at z = 0 and
downdraft at z = ±π/γ that sustain the z modulation
of u0(y, z) (recall that u0 = ±1 at y = ±1 in PCF). But
the fundamental mode v1 concentrates about the critical
layer u0(y, z) = c (c = 0 for these states in PCF). Critical
layers are well-known in the context of the 2D, linear the-
ory of shear ﬂows [13]. Here the critical layer is a surface
in 3D space and it is nonlinearly coupled to the 0-mode
v0(y, z). When the higher harmonics become negligible
and |v0|, |w0| ≪ |u0|, the equation for the fundamental
mode simpliﬁes to [11, 14, 15]

= 0. For high R, the solutions develop
an R−1/3 critical layer in the neighborhood of u0(y, z) −
c = 0 that results from the balance between α(u0 − c) =
α(r − rc) · ∇u0 + O(|r − rc|2) and R−1∇2, so if δ is the
critical layer thickness, we must have αδ|∇u0| ∼ R−1δ−2
and δ ∼ (α|∇u0|R)−1/3 near u0(y, z) − c = 0. Figure 3
conﬁrms that critical layer scaling for the lower branch
steady state in PCF.

The nonlinear coupling [6, 11] between the fundamen-
tal v1, with its critical layer structure, and the rolls
(v0, w0) provides a challenge for the development of a
full asymptotic theory of the lower branch states that
would be able to predict the amplitude scaling of the
fundamental mode. If v1 remained a large scale struc-
ture, its amplitude would have to scale like R−1 in order
for its nonlinear self-interaction to balance the viscous
diﬀusion of the R−1 streamwise rolls v0 [11, 14]. The de-
velopment of a critical layer scale complicates the anal-

ysis and diﬀerent norms and components have diﬀerent
scalings. Nonetheless, an asymptotic theory appears fea-
sible and the present numerical data is clear and its im-
plications are signiﬁcant: the lower branch states tend
to a relatively simple but non-trivial quasi-2D singular
asymptotic state as R → ∞ that is not a solution of the
Euler equation (eqn. (1) with R−1 = 0), and that is not
the laminar ﬂow v = yex either. So the lower branch
states do not bifurcate from the laminar ﬂow, not even
at R = ∞. The data presented is for (α, γ) = (1, 2)
however identical features hold for other (α, γ) values.

Turning now to a stability analysis of the lower branch
coherent states we ﬁnd that these states are distinguished
not only by their asymptotic structure but also by their
stability characteristics. Our eigenmode analysis of the
3D lower branch steady state in plane Couette ﬂow, up
to R = 12000, show that they have a single, real unstable
eigenvalue shown in ﬁgure 4 for (α, γ) = (1.14, 2.5). This
state is most unstable at R ≈ 342 then the unstable
eigenvalue steadily decreases approximately as R−0.48 for
larger R. Furthermore, the corresponding eigenfunction
is in the same shift-reﬂect and shift-rotate symmetries
[6, eqns. (24),(26)] as the lower branch state. This is
not true for the upper branch states which develop new
bifurcations and unstable modes as R increases.

These stability results were obtained using both a di-
rect calculation of the eigenvalues of the full Jacobian in
the doubly symmetric subspace of the lower branch state
with an ellipsoidal truncation of the Fourier-Chebyshev
representation [6], and an iterative calculation in the full
space using the Arnoldi algorithm and the ChannelFlow
code with cubic truncation [16]. The leading unstable
and least stable eigenvalues matched to 5 or 6 signiﬁ-
cant digits. We have also investigated subharmonic insta-
bilities through numerical simulations in a double-sized
box with fundamental wavenumbers α/2 and γ/2. Sam-
ple simulations with ‘random’ perturbations did not re-
veal further instabilities, however a more systematic ap-
proach using the Arnoldi algorithm revealed a weakly
unstable subharmonic in x. For R = 1000 and (α, γ) =
(1.14, 2.5), the fundamental instability shown in ﬁg. 4
has growth rate 0.03681 while the subharmonic instabil-
ity has growth rate 0.005248 ± i 0.02245. The analysis of
this subharmonic mode is left for future study.

Thus,

in the one-period domain with fundamental
wavenumbers (α, γ), the lower branch state is an unsta-
ble equilibrium with a 1D unstable manifold. Therefore
its stable manifold splits the phase space into two parts,
at least locally. The evolution of disturbances in the one-
period domain, starting on the 1D unstable manifold of
the lower branch on either side of the stable manifold
is illustrated in ﬁg. 5. These numerical simulations were
performed using ChannelFlow in the full phase space and
show the time evolutions in the energy input-energy dis-
sipation plane, both normalized by their laminar values.
For plane Couette ﬂow, the normalized energy input rate

is equal to the normalized drag, that is, the drag at the
walls normalized by their laminar value. Perturbations
starting on one side of the stable manifold gently de-
cay back to the linearly stable laminar ﬂow v = yex
while perturbations on the other side of the stable man-
ifold shoot to a turbulent state. Figure 5 also shows the
upper branch sister of the lower branch state which, as
stated earlier, is located in phase space much closer to the
‘turbulent’ state. The decay of perturbed lower branch
states back to the laminar ﬂow follows a standard two-
step evolution. First, the fundamental mode v1, with
its critical layer structure, disappears and the ﬂow re-
laxes to an x-independent state that consists of stream-
wise rolls (0, v0, w0) and streaks u0(y, z) and slowly de-
cays back to the laminar ﬂow on a long viscous time
scale. Perturbations that shoot to a turbulent state fol-
low a much more rapid ‘breakdown’ with high dissipation
rate (about 13 on ﬁg. 5) then settle to a turbulent state
with energy input and dissipation rates of about 4.4 (for
(α, γ, R) = (1, 2, 1000)).

These results suggest that the lower branch stable
manifold is the boundary separating the basin of attrac-
tion of the laminar state from that of the turbulent state
and therefore that they may be the key states control-
ling transition to turbulence. Our results have focused
on symmetric steady states in plane Couette ﬂow but
there is evidence of a similar role for lower branch trav-
eling waves in plane Poiseuille ﬂow [5] and pipe ﬂow [17].
Recent work by Viswanath [18] complements our work
by showing that perturbations of the laminar ﬂow in the
form of streamwise rolls of the right threshold amplitude
+ small 3D noise do get attracted to a lower branch state
before shooting to turbulence. We expect the symmet-
ric lower branch state to play a key role for transition
in plane Couette ﬂow but there exist other asymmet-
ric lower branch traveling wave states as well as peri-
odic orbits [18, 19, 20], each of which may play a simi-
lar ‘transition-backbone’ role, locally in phase space. We
conjecture that the permanent states (steady states, trav-
eling waves and periodic orbits) most relevant to transi-
tion to turbulence will contain R−1 streamwise rolls. It
may be possible to trigger transition with smaller dis-
turbances but we suspect that such disturbances would
necessarily lead to the formation of R−1 rolls and ap-

proach toward a lower branch state with R−1 rolls prior
to transition along the unstable manifold of the lower
branch state.

The extreme low dimensionality of the lower branch
unstable manifold suggests a new approach to turbulence
control. Turbulence control strategies roughly fall into
2 categories: either prevent nonlinear breakdown of the
linearly stable laminar ﬂow, or push the fully nonlinear
turbulent ﬂow back to laminar. A new strategy might be
to put the ﬂow on the lower branch equilibria and keep it
there by controlling its very few unstable modes. There
is a small drag penalty to do so since lower branch states
have a net drag that is 30 to 40% higher than the lami-
nar state as R → ∞ but that is a massive drag reduction
compared to the turbulent state. This control strategy is
related to, but quite distinct from the strategies proposed
in [21] and [22]. Streaks are used in [22] to eﬃciently de-
form the laminar base ﬂow in order to prevent the linear
instability of boundary layer ﬂow. In [21] strategies are
considered to push the turbulent ﬂow onto the laminar
side of the stable manifold of a lower branch unstable
periodic solution in order to relaminarize the ﬂow. The
current proposal is to put the ﬂow on the unstable lower
branch equilibrium and keep it there by controlling its
single unstable eigenmode.

Numerical studies of a kinematic dynamo based on von K´arm´an type ﬂows between two counter-
rotating disks in a ﬁnite cylinder are reported. The ﬂow has been optimized using a water model
experiment, varying the driving impellers conﬁguration. A solution leading to dynamo action for
the mean ﬂow has been found. This solution may be achieved in VKS2, the new sodium experiment
to be performed in Cadarache, France. The optimization process is brieﬂy described and discussed,
then the eﬀects of adding a stationary conducting layer around the ﬂow on the threshold, on the
shape of the neutral mode and on the magnetic energy balance are studied. Finally, the possible
processes involved into kinematic dynamo action in a von K´arm´an ﬂow are reviewed and discussed.
Among the possible processes we highlight the joint eﬀect of the boundary-layer radial velocity shear
and of the Ohmic dissipation localized at the ﬂow/outer-shell boundary.

Introduction

In an electrically conducting ﬂuid, kinetic energy can
be converted into magnetic energy, if the ﬂow is both of
adequate topology and suﬃcient strength. This problem
is known as the dynamo problem [1], and is a magnetic
seed-ﬁeld instability. The equation describing the behav-
ior of the magnetic induction ﬁeld B in a ﬂuid of resis-
tivity η under the action of a velocity ﬁeld v writes in a
dimensionless form:

∂B
∂t

= ∇ × (v × B) +

η
V ∗L∗

2B

∇

where L∗ is a typical length scale and V ∗ a typical
velocity scale. In addition, one must take into account
the divergence-free of B, the electromagnetic boundary
conditions and the Navier-Stokes equations governing the
ﬂuid motion, including the back-reaction of the magnetic
ﬁeld on the ﬂow through the Lorentz force.

The magnetic Reynolds number Rm = V ∗L∗η−
which compares the advection to the Ohmic diﬀusion,
controls the instability. Although this problem is sim-
ple to set, it is still open. While some ﬂows lead to the
dynamo instability with a certain threshold Rc
m, other
ﬂows do not, and anti-dynamo theorems are not suﬃ-
cient to explain this sensitivity to ﬂow geometry [1]. The
two recent experimental success of Karlsruhe and Riga
[2, 3, 4] are in good agreement with analytical and nu-
merical calculations [5, 6]; these two dynamos belong to
the category of constrained dynamos: the ﬂow is forced
in pipes and the level of turbulence remains low. How-
ever, the saturation mechanisms of a dynamo are not

well known, and the role of turbulence on this instability
remains misunderstood [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

The next generation of experimental homogeneous un-
constrained dynamos (still in progress, see for example
Frick et al., Shew et al., Mari´e et al. and O’Connell et
al. in the Carg`ese 2000 workshop proceedings [12]) might
provide answers to these questions. The VKS liquid-
sodium experiment held in Cadarache, France [13, 14, 15]
belong to this category. The VKS experiment is based
on a class of ﬂows called von K´arm´an type ﬂows. In a
closed cylinder, the ﬂuid is inertially set into motion by
two coaxial counterrotating impellers ﬁtted with blades.
This paper being devoted to the hydrodynamical and
magnetohydrodynamical properties of the mean ﬂow, let
us ﬁrst describe brieﬂy the phenomenology of such mean
the
ﬂow. Each impeller acts as a centrifugal pump:
ﬂuid rotates with the impeller and is expelled radially
by centrifugal eﬀect. To ensure mass conservation the
ﬂuid is pumped in the center of the impeller and recircu-
lates near the cylinder wall. In the exact counterrotating
regime, the mean ﬂow is divided into two toric cells sep-
arated by an azimuthal shear layer. Such a mean ﬂow
has the following features, known to favor dynamo ac-
tion: diﬀerential rotation, lack of mirror symmetry and
presence of a hyperbolic stagnation point in the center of
the volume. In the VKS experimental devices, the ﬂow,
inertially driven at kinetic Reynolds number up to 107
(see below), is highly turbulent. As far as full numer-
ical MHD treatment of realistic inertially driven high-
Reynolds-number ﬂows cannot be carried out, this study
is restricted to the kinematic dynamo capability of von
K´arm´an mean ﬂows.

Several measurements of induced ﬁelds have been per-
formed in the ﬁrst VKS device (VKS1) [14], in rather
good agreement with previous numerical studies [16], but
no dynamo was seen:
in fact the achievable magnetic
Reynolds number in the VKS1 experiment remained be-

low the threshold calculated by Mari´e et al. [16]. A larger
device (VKS2, diameter 0.6 m and 300 kW power supply)
is under construction. There is a need to carefully design
the ﬂow driving system for eﬃcient dynamo action.

Dudley and James [17] have performed a numerical
study in spherical geometry of kinematic dynamo based
on analytical “s2t2” ﬂows very similar to a von K´arm´an
ﬂow. Their results show that details of the ﬂow topology
strongly aﬀect the dynamo threshold. In the experimen-
tal approach, lots of parameters can be varied, such as
the impellers blade design, in order to reduce the thresh-
old for dynamo action. For example, the Riga dynamo
experiment —based on the Ponomarenko ﬂow— has been
optimized in order to reduce the threshold [5]. Following
Bullard & Gubbins [18], several studies suggest to add a
layer of stationary conductor around the ﬂow to help the
dynamo action. In the case of cylindrical von K´arm´an
ﬂows, the main generic properties of mean ﬂow dynamo
action have been highlighted by Mari´e et al. [16] on two
diﬀerent experimental velocity ﬁelds. Finally, all these
considerations lead us to consider the implementation of
a static conducting layer in the VKS2 device and to per-
form a careful optimization of the mean velocity ﬁeld by
a kinematic approach of the dynamo problem.

The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst present an
overview of the optimization process which lead to the
experimental conﬁguration chosen for the VKS2 device.
We study the inﬂuence of the shape of the impellers both
on the hydrodynamical ﬂow properties and on the onset
of kinematic dynamo action.
In a second part, we fo-
cus on the understanding of our kinematic dynamo on a
magnetohydrodynamical point of view: we examine the
structure of the eigenmode and the eﬀects of an outer
conducting boundary. We conclude with a review of the
possible mechanisms leading to kinematic dynamo action
in a von K´arm´an ﬂow.

I. OPTIMIZATION OF THE VKS
EXPERIMENT

Water model experiment and kinematic dynamo
code.

1 is of order of 10−

The water model experiment is a half-scale model of
the VKS2 device. We use water as working ﬂuid for our
study, noting that its hydrodynamical properties at 50oC
(kinematic viscosity ν and density ρ) are very close to
sodium properties at 120oC. The magnetic Prandtl num-

integral kinetic Reynolds number Re in the experiments
is typically 107. Thus, the magnetic Reynolds number
Rm = RePm is of order of 102, i.e. of the order of typical
critical magnetic Reynolds numbers for dynamo action.
The inertially driven ﬂow is highly turbulent, with veloc-
ity ﬂuctuations up to 40 percent of the maximum velocity
[13]. It is therefore impossible to compute solutions for
complete non-linear MHD equations. So we focus on the

kinematic problem for the mean ﬂow, and characterize its
role toward dynamo action. We have to ﬁnd a solution
feasible in VKS2, i.e. with liquid sodium in a 0.6 m di-
ameter cylinder with 300 kW power supply. We describe
the optimization process in the following paragraph.

In the water model, we measure the mean velocity ﬁeld
by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). We assume that
the mean ﬂow is a solenoidal vector ﬁeld, and is axisym-
metric. So the toroidal part of the velocity ﬁeld Vθ (in
cylindrical coordinates) and the poloidal part (Vz, Vr) are
independent. Once we know the mean velocity ﬁeld, we
integrate the induction equation using an axially peri-
odic kinematic dynamo code, written by J. L´eorat [19].
The axial periodicity, which does clearly not correspond
to the experimental setup, is used here to get insulating
magnetic boundary conditions easy to implement numer-
ically. In a few cases, comparisons have been made be-
tween the periodic and non-periodic simulations, which
showed no contradictions (F. Stefani, private communi-
cation). The code is pseudo-spectral in the axial and az-
imuthal directions whether radial dependence is treated
by high-order ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme. The time scheme
is second-order Adams-Bashforth with diﬀusive time unit
1. We assume homogeneous conductivity and
td = R2
permeability; the external medium is insulating. Further
details on the code will be found in Ref. [19]. We use
the same initial magnetic seed ﬁeld as in Ref. [16]. We
can act on the electromagnetic boundary conditions by
adding a layer of stationary conductor of dimensionless
thickness w, surrounding the ﬂow (see Fig. 1 for a sketch
of the VKS2 experiment).

c η−

The goal of our optimization is to ﬁnd the impeller
whose mean velocity ﬁeld leads to the lowest Rc
m for the
lowest power cost. We performed an iterative optimiza-
tion loop: for a given conﬁguration, we measure the mean
velocity ﬁeld and the power consumption. Then we sim-
ulate the kinematic dynamo problem. We try to identify
features favoring dynamo action and modify parameters
in order to reduce the threshold and the power consump-
tion and go back to the loop.

Fig. 2 shows the mean ﬂow produced by the optimal
impeller. The cylinder has a radius Rc and a height Hc.

We choose Rc as unit scale for lengths: L∗ = Rc.
In
the following, all the spatial quantities are given in units
of Rc. The hydrodynamical time scale is based on the

impeller driving frequency f :

performed measurements of velocity in several points for
several driving frequencies. We have checked that, as
expected for so highly turbulent a ﬂow, the dimension-
less velocity v does not depend on the integral Reynolds
1 [20]. We also perform global
number Re = V ∗L∗ν−
power consumption measurements: torques are measured
through the current consumption in the motors given by
the servo drives and have been calibrated by calorimetry.
Further precisions about the water model setup and its
evolutions can be found in [16, 21]. In the water model
experiment dedicated to the study reported in this paper,
special care has been given to the measurements of ve-
locity ﬁelds, notably near the blades and at the cylinder
wall, where we reﬁne the measurement grid. The me-
chanical quality of the experimental setup now ensures
good symmetry of the mean velocity ﬁelds with respect
to rotation of π around any diameter passing through the
center of the cylinder (Rπ-symmetry). The ﬁelds pre-
sented in this paper are still symmetrized but are neither
smoothed, nor stretched to a diﬀerent aspect ratio. The
mean ﬂow respects the phenomenology we give in the in-
troduction: it is made of two toroidal cells separated by a
shear layer, and two poloidal recirculation cells (Fig. 2).

High velocities are measured in the whole volume: the
inertial stirring is actually very eﬃcient. Typically, the
average over the ﬂow volume of the mean velocity ﬁeld
is of order of 0.3V ∗.

Impeller tunable parameters.

The impellers are ﬂat disks of radius R ﬁtted with 8
blades of height h. The blades are arcs of circle with a
curvature radius C and are radial at the center of the
disks. We use the angle α = arcsin( R
2C ) to label the dif-
ferent curvatures (see Fig. 3). For straight blades α = 0.
By convention, we use positive values to label the di-
rection corresponding to the case where the ﬂuid is set
into motion by the convex face of the blades. In order
to study the opposite curvature (α < 0) we just rotate
the impeller in the other direction. The two counter-
rotating impellers are separated by Hc, the height of
the cylinder. We ﬁxed the aspect ratio Hc/Rc of the
ﬂow volume to 1.8 as in VKS device.
In practice we
successively examine the eﬀects of each parameter h, R
and α on some global quantities characterizing the mean
ﬂow. We then varied the parameters one by one, until we
found a relative optimum for the dynamo threshold. We
tested 12 diﬀerent impellers, named TMxx, with three
radii (R = 0.5, 0.75&0.925), various curvature angles α
and diﬀerent blade heights h.

and symmetrized for kinematic dynamo simulations. Cylin-

of the ﬂow, color code to toroidal part. We use cylindrical
coordinates (r, θ, z), with origin at the center of the cylinder.

We know from empirical results [16, 17] that the
poloidal to toroidal ratio Γ of the ﬂow has a great impact
on the dynamo threshold. Moreover, a purely toroidal
ﬂow is unable of sustained dynamo action [22, 23], while
it is possible for a purely poloidal ﬂow [24, 25]. We also
notice that, for a Ponomarenko ﬂow, the pitch parameter
plays a major role [5, 26, 27]. All these results lead us to

where hP i is the spatially averaged value of the poloidal
part of the mean ﬂow, and hT i the average of the toroidal
part.

Another quantity of interest is the velocity factor V:
the dimensionless maximum value of the velocity. In our
simulations, the magnetic Reynolds number Rm is based
on the velocity factor, i.e. on a typical measured velocity
in order to take into account the stirring eﬃciency:

We also deﬁne a power coeﬃcient Kp by dimensional
analysis. We write the power P given by a motor to
sustain the ﬂow as follows:

P = Kp(Re, geometry)ρ R5

c Ω3

with ρ the density of the ﬂuid and Ω = 2πf the driving
pulsation. We have checked [21] that Kp does not depend
on the Reynolds number Re as expected for so highly
turbulent inertially driven ﬂows [20].

The velocity factor measures the stirring eﬃciency: the
greater V, the lesser the rotation frequency needed to
reach a given velocity. Besides, the lesser Kp, the lesser
the power to sustain a given driving frequency. The di-
mensionless number which we need to focus on compares
the velocity eﬀectively reached in the ﬂow to the power
consumption. We call it the MaDo number:

MaDo =

V
K1/3
p

The greater MaDo, the lesser the power needed to reach
a given velocity (i.e. a given magnetic Reynolds num-
ber). The MaDo number is thus a hydrodynamical eﬃ-
ciency coeﬃcient. To make the VKS experiment feasible
at laboratory scale, it is necessary both to have great
MaDo numbers and low critical magnetic Reynolds num-
bers Rc
m. The question laying under the process of op-
timization is to know if we could on the one hand ﬁnd
a class of impellers whith mean ﬂows exhibiting dynamo
action, and on the other hand if we could increase the
ratio MaDo/Rc
It means that we have to look both
at the global hydrodynamical quantities and at the mag-
netic induction stability when varying the impellers tun-
able parameters h, R and α.

Fig. 4 presents MaDo for the whole set of impellers.
For our class of impellers, the MaDo number remains of
the same order of magnitude within ±10%. Only the

higher value. In the ideal case of homogeneous isotropic

turbulence, far from boundaries, we can show that what
we call the MaDo number is related to the Kolmogorov
constant CK ≃ 1.5 [28]. The Kolmogorov constant is
related to the kinetic energy spatial spectrum:

E(k) = CK ǫ2/3 k−

where ǫ is the massic dissipated power, and k the wave
number. If we assume that ǫ is homogeneous —P being
the total dissipated power we measure— we have:

i.e., with CK = 1.5, we should have, for homogeneous
isotropic turbulence MaDo ≃ 0.81. In our closed system
with blades, we recover the same order of magnitude,
and the fact that MaDo does merely not depend on the
driving system. Thus, there is no obvious optimum for
the hydrodynamical eﬃciency. Between various impellers
producing dynamo action, the choice will be dominated
by the value of the threshold Rc

m.

Let us ﬁrst get rid of the eﬀect of the blade height
h. The power factor Kp varies quasi-linearly with h.
As MaDo is almost constant, smaller h impellers require
higher rotation frequencies, rising technical diﬃculties.
We choose h = 0.2, a compromise between stirring ef-
ﬁciency and the necessity to keep the free volume suﬃ-
ciently large.

Inﬂuence of the ratio Γ

In our cylindrical von K´arm´an ﬂow without conducting
layer (w = 0), there seems to be an optimal value for Γ
close to 0.7. Since the mean ﬂow is axisymmetric and
divergence-free, the ratio Γ can be changed numerically
by introducing an arbitrary multiplicative factor on, say,
the toroidal part of the velocity ﬁeld. In the following,
Γ0 stands for the experimental ratio for the measured
mean velocity ﬁeld, whereas Γ stands for the numerically
adjusted ratio.

FIG. 5: Magnetic energy growth rate σ vs. numerical ratio Γ.
Rm = 100, w = 0. Simulations performed for two diﬀerent
mean velocity ﬁelds (impellers TM71 and TM73 of radius
R = 0.75). Larger symbols correspond to natural Γ0 of the
impeller. Vertical dashed line corresponds to optimal Γ = 0.7.
Closed symbols stand for stationary regimes, whereas open
symbols stand for oscillating regimes for Γ . 0.6.

In Fig. 5, we plot the magnetic energy growth rate
σ (half the magnetic ﬁeld growth rate) for diﬀerent val-
ues of Γ, for magnetic Reynolds number Rm = 100 and
without conducting layer (w = 0). The two curves cor-
respond to two diﬀerent mean velocity ﬁelds which have
been experimentally measured in the water model (they
correspond to the TM71 and TM73 impellers, see table
I for their characteristics). We notice that the curves
show the same bell shape with maximum growth rate at
Γ ≃ 0.7, which conﬁrms the results of Ref. [16].

For Γ . 0.6, oscillating damped regimes (open symbols
in Fig. 5) are observed. We plot the temporal evolution

5

of the magnetic energy in corresponding case in Fig. 6:
these regimes are qualitatively diﬀerent from the oscillat-
ing regimes already found in [16] for non Rπ-symmetric
Γ = 0.7 velocity ﬁelds, consisting of one mode with a
complex growth rate: the magnetic ﬁeld is a single trav-
eling wave, and the magnetic energy, integrated over the
volume, evolves monotonically in time.

In our case, the velocity ﬁeld is Rπ-symmetric. It is
known that symmetries strongly constrain the nature of
eigenvalues and eigenmodes of linear stability problems.
Due to Rπ-symmetry invariance of the evolution operator
for the magnetic ﬁeld, two type of solutions are allowed
[29]:

• One Rπ-symmetric eigenmode with a real eigen-
value. The corresponding bifurcation is steady.

• Two eigenmodes images one of the other by Rπ,
associated with complex-conjugate eigenvalues.

2t0

For Γ & 0.6, we always observed stationary regimes. Oth-
erwise, for Γ . 0.6, starting the temporal integration
with an initial condition for the magnetic ﬁeld which has
non vanishing projection on both eigenmodes, we obtain
a mix of two modes with complex-conjugate growth rates
and the magnetic energy decays exponentially while pul-
sating (Fig. 6). The same feature has been reported for
analytical “s0
2 − like ﬂows” in a cylindrical geometry
with a Galerkin analysis of neutral modes and eigenvalues
for the induction equation [30]. A major interest of the
latter method is that it gives the structure of the modes:
one mode is localized near one impeller and rotates with
it, the other being localized and rotating with the other
impeller. Growing oscillating dynamos are rare in our
system: a single case has been observed, for TM71(−)
(Γ0 = 0.53) with a w = 0.4 conducting layer at Rm = 215
(Rc
m = 197, see table I). Such high a value for the mag-
netic Reynolds number is out of the scope of our experi-
mental study, and is close to the practical upper limit of
the numerical code.

Experimental dynamo action will thus be searched in
the stationary regimes domain Γ & 0.6. Without con-
ducting layer, we have to look for the optimal impeller
around Γ0 ≃ 0.7.

Eﬀects of the impeller radius R

One could a priori expect that a very large impeller
is favorable to the hydrodynamical eﬃciency. This is
not the case. For impellers with straight blades, MaDo
slightly decreases with R: for respectively R = 0.5, 0.75
and 0.925, we respectively get MaDo = 2.13, 1.64 and
1.62. This tendency is below the experimental error. We
thus consider that MaDo does not depend on the im-
peller.

Nevertheless one should not forget that V varies quasi-
linearly with impeller radius R: if the impeller becomes
smaller it must rotate faster to achieve a given value for

the magnetic Reynolds number, which may again cause
mechanical diﬃculties. We do not explore radii R smaller
than 0.5.

Concerning the topology of the mean ﬂow, there is no
noticeable eﬀects of the radius R on the poloidal part.
We always have two toric cells of recirculation, centered
at a radius rp close to 0.75 ± 0.02 and almost constant
for all impellers (see right part of Fig. 7). The ﬂuid is
pumped to the impellers for 0 < r < rp and is reinjected
in the volume rp < r < 1. This can be interpreted as a
geometrical constraint to ensure mass conservation: the
circle of radius r = √2
2 (very close to 0.75) separates the
unit disk into two regions of same area.

The topology of the toroidal part of the mean ﬂow now
depends on the radius of the impeller. The radial proﬁle
of vθ shows stronger departure from solid-body rotation

6

for smaller R (left part of Fig. 7): this will be emphasized
in the discussion. We performed simulations for three
straight blades impellers of radii R = 0.5, R = 0.75 and
R = 0.925; without conducting shell (w = 0) and with
a conducting layer of thickness w = 0.4. We have inte-
grated the induction equation for the three velocity ﬁelds
numerically set to various Γ and compared the growth
rates. The impeller of radius R = 0.75 close to the radius
of the center of the poloidal recirculation cells systemat-
ically gets greatest growth rate. So, this radius R = 0.75
has been chosen for further investigations.

increases while the average value of the toroidal veloc-
ity hT i decreases: the ratio Γ0 is a continuous growing
function of curvature α (Fig. 8). A phenomenological
explanation for hT i variation can be given. The ﬂuid
pumped by the impeller is centrifugally expelled and is
constrained to follow the blades. So, it exits the impeller
with a velocity almost tangent to the blade exit angle
α. Thus, for α < 0 (resp. α > 0), the azimuthal ve-
locity is bigger (resp. smaller) than the solid body rota-
tion. Finally, it is possible to adjust Γ0 to a desired value
by choosing the good curvature α, in order to lower the
threshold for dynamo action.

Without conducting shell, the optimal impeller is the
TM71 (Γ0 = 0.69). But its threshold Rc
m = 179 cannot
be achieved in the VKS2 experiment. So, we now have to
ﬁnd another way to reduce Rc
m, the only relevant factor
for the optimization.

As in the Riga experiment [2, 5], and as in numerical
studies of various ﬂows [18, 31, 32], we consider a sta-
tionary layer of ﬂuid sodium surrounding the ﬂow. This
signiﬁcantly reduces the critical magnetic Reynolds num-
ber, but also slightly shifts the optimal value for Γ. We
have varied w between w = 0 and w = 1; since the ex-
perimental VKS2 device is of ﬁxed overall size (diameter
0.6 m), the ﬂow volume decreases while increasing the
static layer thickness w. A compromise between this con-
straint and the eﬀects of increasing w has been found to
be w = 0.4 and we mainly present here results concerning
this value of w. In Fig. 9, we compare the bell-shaped
curves obtained by numerical variation of the ratio Γ for
the same impeller at the same Rm, in the case w = 0,
and w = 0.4. The growth rates are much higher for

w = 0.4, and the peak of the curve shifts from 0.7 to 0.8.
We have performed simulations for four diﬀerent velocity
ﬁelds (Fig. 10), for w = 0.4 at Rm = 43: the result is
very robust, the four curves being very close.

In Fig. 11, we plot the growth rates σ of the magnetic
energy simulated for four real mean velocity ﬁelds at var-
ious Rm and for w = 0.4. The impeller TM73 was de-
signed to create a mean velocity ﬁeld with Γ0 = 0.80. It
appears to be the best impeller, with a critical magnetic
Reynolds number of Rc
m = 43. Its threshold is divided by
a factor 4 when adding a layer of stationary conductor.
This conﬁguration (TM73, w = 0.4) will be the ﬁrst one
tested in the VKS2 experiment. The VKS2 experiment
will be able to reach the threshold of kinematic dynamo

produced between two counterrotating TM73 impellers
in a cylinder of aspect ratio Hc
Rc = 1.8, like the ﬁrst exper-
imental conﬁguration chosen for the VKS2 experiment.
See Table I for the characteristics of this impeller, and

ﬁeld concentrates near the axis into two twisted banana-
shaped regions of strong axial ﬁeld. Near the interface
between the ﬂow and the outer insulating medium, there
are two small sheets located on both sides of the plane
z = 0 where the magnetic ﬁeld is almost transverse to
the external boundary and dipolar. The topology of the
neutral mode is very close to those obtained by Mari´e et
al.
[16] with diﬀerent impellers, and to those obtained
on analytical s0

with the previously described Galerkin analysis [30].

2t0

In Fig. 13 we present sections of the B and j ﬁelds,
j = ∇ × B being the dimensionless current density. The
scale for B is chosen such as the magnetic energy in-
tegrated over the volume is unity. Since the azimuthal

dependency is m = 1, two cut planes are suﬃcient to
describe the neutral mode. In the bulk where twisted-
banana-shaped structures are identiﬁed, we note that
the toroidal and poloidal parts of B are of the same or-
der of magnitude and that B concentrates near the axis,
where it experiences strong stretching due to the stagna-
tion point in the velocity ﬁeld. Around the center of the
ﬂow recirculation loops (r ≃ 0.7 and z ≃ ±0.5 see Fig. 2)
we note a low level of magnetic ﬁeld: it is expelled from
the vortices. Close to the outer boundary, we mainly ob-
serve a strong transverse dipolar ﬁeld (Fig. 13 upper-left)
correlated with two small loops of very strong current
density j (Fig. 13 lower-left). These current loops seem
constrained by the boundary, and might dissipate great
amount of energy by Joule eﬀect (see discussion below).

10

Eﬀects of the conducting layer

As indicated in the ﬁrst section, the main eﬀect of
adding a conducting layer is to strongly reduce the
threshold.
In Fig. 14, we plot the critical magnetic
Reynolds number for increasing values of the layer thick-
ness. The reduction is important: the threshold is al-
ready divided by 4 for w = 0.4 and the eﬀects tends
to saturate exponentially with a characteristic thickness
w = 0.14 (ﬁt in Fig. 14), as observed for an α2-model
of the Karlsruhe dynamo by Avalos et al. [32]. Adding
the layer also modiﬁes the spatial structure of the neutral
mode:
isodensity surface for w = 0.6 is plotted in Fig.
15 with the corresponding sections of B and j ﬁelds in
Fig. 16. The two twisted bananas of axial ﬁeld are still
present in the core, but the sheets of magnetic energy
near the r = 1 boundary strongly develop.
Instead of
thin folded sheets on both sides of the equatorial plane,
the structures unfold and grow in the axial and azimuthal
directions to occupy a wider volume and extend on both
sides of the ﬂow/conducting-layer boundary r = 1. This
eﬀect is spectacular and occurs even for low values of w.
Small conducting layers are a challenge for numerical
calculations: as far as the measured tangential velocity
at the wall is not zero, adding a layer of conductor at
rest gives rise to a strong velocity shear, which in practice
needs at least 10 grid points to be represented. The max-
imal grid width used is 0.005: the minimal non-zero w is
thus w = 0.05. The exponential ﬁt in Fig. 14 is relevant
for w & 0.1. We can wonder if the departure from expo-
nential behavior is of numerical origin, or corresponds to
a cross-over between diﬀerent dynamo processes.

The analysis of B and j proﬁles in Fig. 16 ﬁrst reveals
smoother B-lines and much more homogeneous a repar-
tition for the current density. The azimuthal current
loops responsible for the transverse dipolar magnetic ﬁeld
now develop in a wider space (Fig. 16 lower-left). Two
poloidal current loops appear in this plane, closing in

the conducting shell. These loops are responsible for the
growth of the azimuthal magnetic ﬁeld at r = 1 (Fig. 16
upper-left). Changes in the transverse plane (θ = π
2 )
are less spectacular. As already stated in Refs. [31, 32],
the positive eﬀect of adding a layer of stationary conduc-
tor may reside in the subtle balance between magnetic
energy production and Ohmic dissipation.

Energy balance

In order to better characterize which processes lead to
dynamo action in a von K´arm´an ﬂow, we will now look
at the energy balance equation: let us ﬁrst separate the
whole space into three domains.

The term in the left part of the equation is the tem-

term in the right part of the equation corresponds to
the source term which writes as a work of the Lorentz
force. It exists only in Ωi and is denoted W . The second
term is the Ohmic dissipation D, and the last term is the
Poynting vector ﬂux P which vanishes at inﬁnite r.

At the dynamo threshold, integration over the whole

space gives

0 = W − Do − Di

In Fig. 17, we plot the integrands of W and D at the
threshold for dynamo action, normalized by the total in-
stantaneous magnetic energy, as a function of radius r
for various w. For w = 0, both the production and dissi-
pation mostly take place near the wall between ﬂow and
the insulating medium (r = 1), which could not have
been guessed from the cuts of j and B in ﬁgure 13: the
w = 0 curve in Fig. 17 has two bumps. The ﬁrst one
at r ≃ 0.1 corresponds to the twisted bananas, while the
second is bigger and is localized near the ﬂow bound-
ary r = 1. A lot of current should be dissipated at the
conductor-insulator interface due to the “frustration” of
the transverse dipole. This can explain the huge eﬀect of
adding a conducting layer at this interface: the “strain
concentration” is released when a conducting medium is
added. So if we increase w, the remaining current con-
centration at r = 1 + w decreases very rapidly to zero,
which explains the saturation of the eﬀect. In the mean
time, the curves collapse on a single smooth curve, both
for the dissipation and the production (solid black curves
in Fig. 17). For greater values of w, the production den-
sity and the dissipation in the core of the ﬂow r < 0.2 are
smaller, whereas a peak of production and dissipation is
still visible at the ﬂow-conducting shell interface r = 1.
The conducting layer does not spread but reinforces the
localization of the dynamo process at this interface. This
can help us to understand the process which rises the dy-
namo in a von K´arm´an type ﬂow.

Let us now look at the repartition between the dissi-
pation integrated over the ﬂow Di and the dissipation
integrated over the conducting shell Do (Fig. 18). The
ratio Do/Di increases monotonically with w and then
saturates to 0.16. This ratio remains small, which con-
ﬁrms the results of Avalos et al. [32] for a stationary dy-
namo. We conclude that the conducting layer existence
—allowing currents to ﬂow— happens to be more impor-
tant than the relative amount of Joule energy dissipated
in this layer.

III. DISCUSSION

Flow helicity

It is expected [1, 33] that kinetic helicity helps dy-
namo action. While optimizing the Riga dynamo ex-
periment, Stefani [5] noticed that the best ﬂows were
helicity maximizing. The ﬁrst point we focused on dur-
ing our optimization process, i.e., the existence of an
optimal value for Γ, leads us to address the question

case, for aspect ratio Hc/Rc = 1.8 and impellers of ra-
dius R = 0.75, the mean helicity at a given rotation
v.(∇ × v) rdrdz does not depend on the
rate hHi =
blade curvature (see Table I). Observation of Fig. 19
also reveals that the dominant contribution in the helic-
ity scalar product is the product of the toroidal velocity
(vθ ∝ hT i) by the poloidal recirculation cells vorticity
((∇ × v)θ ∝ hP i). We can therefore assume the scaling
hHi ∝ hP ihT i, which is consistent with the fact that the
product hP ihT i and hHi are both almost constant (Table
I).

contribution vθ.(∇ × v)θ is dominant.

To compare the helicity content of diﬀerent ﬂows, we
now consider the mean helicity at a given Rm, hHi/V 2,
more relevant for the dynamo problem.
Figure 20
presents hHi/V 2 versus Γ0 for all h = 0.2 impellers. The
R = 0.75 family reaches a maximum of order of 1 for
Γ0 ≃ 0.9. This tendency is conﬁrmed by the solid curve
which stands for a numerical variation of Γ for TM73 ve-
locity ﬁeld and is maximum for Γ = 1. Besides, even if
R = 0.925 impellers give reasonably high values of helic-
ity near Γ = 0.5, there is an abrupt break in the tendency
for high curvature: TM60 (see Ref. [16]) exhibits large
Γ0 = 0.9 but less helicity than TM74. Inset in Fig. 20
highlights this optimum for hHi/V 2 versus impeller ra-
dius R. This conﬁrms the impeller radius R = 0.75 we
have chosen during the optimization described above.

As far as the optimal value toward dynamo action for
the ratio Γ (close to 0.7 − 0.8, depending on w) is lower

than 1, the best velocity ﬁeld is not absolutely helicity-
maximizing. In other words, the best dynamo ﬂow con-
tains more toroidal velocity than the best helical ﬂow.
As shown by Leprovost [34], one can interpret the opti-
mal Γ as a quantity that maximizes the product of mean
helicity by a measure of the ω-eﬀect, i.e., the product
hHihT i ∼ hP ihT i2.

Neutral mode structure

Is it possible to identify typical structures in the eigen-
mode of the von K´arm´an dynamo ? We have observed
magnetic structures in the shape of bananas and sheets
(see Figs. 12 and 15). In the center of the ﬂow volume,
there is an hyperbolic stagnation point equivalent to “α-
type” stagnation points in ABC-ﬂows (with equal coeﬃ-
cients) [35]. In the equatorial plane at the boundary the
merging of the poloidal cells remembers “β-type” stag-
nation points in ABC-ﬂows. In such ﬂows, the magnetic
ﬁeld is organized into cigars along the α-type stagnation
points and sheets on both sides of the β-type stagna-
tion points [36]: this is very similar to the structure of
the neutral mode we get for w = 0 (Fig. 12). We also
performed magnetic induction simulations with an im-
posed axial ﬁeld for the poloidal part of the ﬂow alone.
We obtain a strong axial stretching: the central stag-
nation point could be responsible for the growth of the
bananas/cigars, which are twisted by the axial diﬀeren-
tial rotation after. One should nevertheless not forget
that real instantaneous ﬂows are highly turbulent, and

the Ponomarenko ﬂow does not lead to dynamo action
without conducting layer (Λ = 1). The reduction factors
considered above are maximal values obtained either for
high w in stationary dynamos or for the optimal w in
oscillatory dynamos [31, 32].

In order to understand why Λ is so high in the present
case, we compare the behavior of an optimal analyti-
cal model-ﬂow proposed by Mari´e, Normand and Davi-
aud [30] with our experimental ﬂow in similar geome-
try. As the Galerkin method used by these authors does
not allow to study the eﬀect of a conducting layer, we
performed simulations of the kinematic dynamo for the
velocity ﬁeld given by equation (55) in Ref. [30]:

vr = −

r(1 − r)2(1 + 2r) cos(πz)

π
2

vθ = 4ǫr(1 − r) sin(πz/2)

vz = (1 − r)(1 + r − 5r2) sin(πz)

We ﬁrst recover numerically the dynamo threshold at
Rc
m = 58 for w = 0 and Γ = 0.8 (the free parameter
ǫ in the model is linked to Γ and Γ = 0.8 corresponds
to ǫ = 0.7259). With a w = 1 conducting layer, we get
a low Λ = 0.26 reduction rate, i.e. Rc
m = 43, close to
the TM73 threshold for w = 1: Rc
m = 37. The threshold
reduction is also found to show an exponential behavior
with w, of characteristic thickness 0.20, as in Fig. 14.

Let us describe the model ﬂow features represented
in Fig. 7 (bottom). The velocity is very smooth at the
cylindrical boundary: the toroidal velocity is maximum
at r = 0.5 and slowly decreases to zero at r = 1. The
poloidal recirculation loops are centered at rp = 0.56
and the axial velocity also decreases slowly to zero at
the cylindrical boundary. Thus, the mass conservation
requires the axial velocity to be much higher in the cen-
tral disk (0 < r < rp) than outside. These constraints
make analytical models somewhat diﬀerent from exper-
imental mean ﬂows (Fig. 7). In particular, high kinetic
Reynolds numbers forbid smooth velocity decrease near
boundaries. This explains why experimental ﬂows do not
lead to low thresholds unless a conducting layer is added.
We now consider the eﬀect of a conducting shell on the
model ﬂow eigenmode structure. First note that with-
out conducting shell, the model neutral mode structure
is already very similar to that of TM73 with conduct-
ing shell: the transverse dipole is not conﬁned into thin
sheets but develops into wider regions connected to ba-
nanas of axial ﬁeld in the center. Adding the conducting
layer mainly lets the neutral mode structure unchanged
and thus quantitatively reduces its impact compared to
the experimental case.

Finally, from the very numerous simulations of experi-
mental and model von K´arm´an ﬂows performed, we con-
clude that the adjunction of a static conducting layer to
experimental ﬂows makes the eigenmode geometry closer

that such peculiar stagnation points of the mean ﬂow are
especially sensitive to ﬂuctuations.

The presence of the conducting layer introduces new
structures in the neutral mode (see Figs. 12, 15 and 13,
16). In order to complete our view of the ﬁelds in the
conducting layer, we plot them on the r = 1 cylinder for
w = 0.6 (Fig. 21). As for w = 0, the dipolar main part of
the magnetic ﬁeld gets radially into the ﬂow volume at
θ = π and exits at θ = 0 (Fig. 21 up). However, looking
around z = 0, we observe that a part of this magnetic
ﬂux is azimuthally diverted in the conducting shell along
the ﬂow boundary. This eﬀect does not exist without
conducting shell: the outer part of the dipole is anchored
in the stationary conducting layer.

Another speciﬁc feature is the anti-colinearity of the
current density j with B at (z = 0; θ = 0,π; r = 1), which
could remind an “α”-eﬀect. However, while the radial
magnetic ﬁeld is clearly due to a current loop (arrows
in the center of Fig. 21 down), jr is not linked to a B-
loop (Fig. 21 up), which is not obvious from Fig. 16.
Thus, the anti-colinearity is restricted to single points
(z = 0; θ = 0, π; r = 1). We have checked this, computing
the angle between j and B: the isocontours of this angle
are very complex and the peculiar values corresponding
to colinearity or anti-colinearity are indeed restricted to
single points.

Dynamo threshold reduction factor

We have shown that the threshold for dynamo action is
divided by four when adding a conducting layer of thick-
ness w = 0.4. This eﬀect is very strong. Following Avalos
and Plunian [32], let us compare the threshold reduction
c
m(w)
factor Λ = 1 − R
m(w=0) for various kinematic dynamos.
Rc
The threshold reduction for TM73-ﬂow (Λ = 0.78) is
much higher than for the Karlsruhe (Λ = 0.11) and Riga
(Λ = 0.56) dynamos. Reduction rate can also be rad-
ically diﬀerent between model ﬂows: the α2-model for
Karlsruhe dynamo gives a low-Rc
m-dynamo for w = 0
and beneﬁts very few of a ﬁnite w (Λ = 0.11), while

to optimal model eigenmodes, and critical Rc
m get closer
to moderate values (typically 50). It may thus be conjec-
tured that the puzzling sensitivity of dynamo threshold
to ﬂow geometry is lowered when a static layer is present.
This feature presumably renders the dynamo more robust
to ﬂow topology details and could also act favorably in
the non linear regime.

Dynamo mechanisms

As emphasized in the Introduction, there is no suﬃ-
cient condition for dynamo action and although numer-
ical examples of dynamo ﬂows are numerous, little is
known about the eﬀective parameters leading to an ef-
ﬁcient energy conversion process. For example, the clas-
sical α and axial ω mechanisms have been proposed to
be the main ingredients of the von K´arm´an dynamo [13].
In this paragraph, we relate the results of the optimiza-
tion procedure to some more elementary mechanisms.
The starting point is the observation that dynamo ac-
tion results from a constructive coupling between mag-
netic ﬁelds components due to velocity gradients, which,
in the present axisymmetric case, reduce to derivatives
with respect to r (radial gradients) and to z (axial gra-
dients). The gradients of azimuthal velocity generate a
toroidal ﬁeld from a poloidal one (ω-eﬀect [1]), while re-
generation of the poloidal ﬁeld is generally described as
resulting from an helicity eﬀect (denoted α-eﬀect if scale
separation is present [37]). How do these general con-
siderations apply to the present ﬂow ? As in the Sun,
which shows both a polar-equatorial diﬀerential rotation
and a tachocline transition, our experimental ﬂow ﬁelds
present azimuthal velocity shear in axial and radial di-
rections (see Fig. 2). So, we will consider below the role
of both axial and radial ω-eﬀect.

We will discuss these mechanisms and then suggest
that, for a ﬂow surrounded by a static conducting layer,
the dynamo mechanism is based on the presence of a
strong velocity shear (at the boundary layer r = 1) which
lies in this case in the bulk of the overall electrically con-
ducting domain.

Axial ω-eﬀect

Induction simulations performed with the toroidal part
of the velocity show an axial ω-eﬀect which converts an
imposed axial ﬁeld into toroidal ﬁeld through ∂vθ/∂z.
Such a Rm-linear eﬀect has been evidenced in VKS1 ex-
periment [14]. This eﬀect concentrates around the equa-
torial shear layer (z = 0) as visible in Fig. 2. Thus, we
can think that the axial ω-eﬀect is involved in the dy-
namo process: for dynamo action to take place, there is
a need for another process to convert toroidal magnetic
ﬁeld into poloidal ﬁeld.

α-eﬀect, helicity eﬀect

15

Rm-non-linear conversion from transverse to axial
magnetic ﬁeld has also been reported in VKS1 experi-
ment [15]. This eﬀect is not the usual scale-separation
α-eﬀect [37] and has been interpreted as an eﬀect of the
global helicity as reported by Parker [33] (in the follow-
ing, it will be denoted “α”-eﬀect). A trace of this helicity
eﬀect lies probably in the link we established above be-
tween optimal Γ and helicity maximizing. It is believed
to take place in the high kinetic helicity regions of the
ﬂow (see Fig. 19).

Is an “α”ω mechanism relevant ?

Bourgoin et al.

[38] performed a study of induction
mechanisms in von K´arm´an-type ﬂows, using a quasi-
static iterative approach. They show that “α”ω dynamo
action, seen as a three-step loop-back inductive mecha-
nism, is possible, but very diﬃcult to obtain, ﬁelds being
widely expelled by the vortices. The authors highlight
the fact that the coupling between the axial ω-eﬀect and
the “α”-eﬀect is very ineﬃcient for our velocity ﬁelds, be-
cause of the spatial separation of these two induction ef-
fects. Our observations of the velocity and helicity ﬁelds
conﬁrm this separation.

The authors also discovered an induction eﬀect — the
BC-eﬀect — related to the magnetic diﬀusivity discon-
tinuity at the insulating boundary that could help the
dynamo action. This BC-eﬀect, illustrated on our TM73-
velocity ﬁeld (Fig. 14 in Ref. [38]), is enhanced in the case
of strong velocity and vorticity gradients at the bound-
aries, characteristic of high Reynolds number ﬂows. So,
we are convinced that for experimental ﬂow ﬁelds at
w = 0, the BC-eﬀect helps the dynamo. This is coherent
with our observations of high tangential current density
near the boundaries and high magnetic energy produc-
tion at r = 1 even for w = 0 (Fig. 17). Such a current
sheet formation and BC-eﬀect was reported by Bullard
and Gubbins [18].

When a large layer of sodium at rest is added, we be-
lieve that the BC-eﬀect vanishes because the conductivity
discontinuity occurs at r = 1 + w while the currents still
concentrate at the ﬂow boundary r = 1. However, with
a conducting layer, we have presented many features fa-
voring the dynamo: in the next paragraph, we propose a
possible origin for this conducting-layer eﬀect.

Radial ω-eﬀect, boundary layers and static shell

With a layer of steady conducting material surround-
ing the ﬂow, we note the occurence of two major phe-
nomena:

• the possibility for currents to ﬂow freely in this shell

(Fig. 17),

• the presence of a very strong velocity shear local-
ized at the boundary layer which now lies in the
bulk of the electrically conducting domain.

Let us again consider the shape of the velocity shear.
Any realistic (with real hydrodynamical boundary condi-
tions) von K´arm´an ﬂow obviously presents negative gra-
dients of azimuthal velocity ∂vθ/∂r between the region
of maximal velocity and the ﬂow boundary. This region
can be divided into two parts: a smooth decrease in the
bulk (R . r . 1) and a sharp gradient in the boundary
layer at r = 1 (Fig. 7).

These gradients can be responsible for a radial ω-eﬀect,
producing Bθ with Br, in both insulating and conduct-
ing cases. However, without conducting layer, only the
smooth part of the gradient which lies in the bulk will be
eﬃcient for dynamo action. Indeed, owing to the huge
value of the kinetic Reynolds number and the very small
value of the magnetic Prandtl number, the sharp bound-
ary layer gradient is conﬁned in a tiny domain, much
smaller than the magnetic variation scale. No reasonable
electrical currents can ﬂow in it and we did not resolve
this boundary layer with the numerical code: it is totally
neglected by our approach.

The role of both types of gradients is illustrated by
the observation (Fig. 7, left) of impellers of large radius
(R = 0.925). For such impellers there is almost no de-
parture from solid body rotation proﬁles in the ﬂow re-
gion and these impellers lead to dynamo action only with
conducting shell [16], i.e., due to the sharp gradient. On
the other hand, our R = 0.75 selected impellers present a
stronger bulk-gradient and achieve dynamo in both cases.
Actually, the way we numerically modelized the von
K´arm´an ﬂow surrounded by a static conducting layer
—considering an equivalent ﬂuid system in which the
boundary layer appears as a simple velocity jump in its
bulk— is coherent with the problem to solve. The veloc-
ity jump, just as any strong shear, is a possible eﬃcient
source for the radial ω-eﬀect.

A shear and shell dynamo ?

We pointed out above that the regions of maximal he-
licity (the “α”-eﬀect sources, see Fig. 19) are close to
those of radial shear where radial ω-eﬀect source term
takes place. Dynamo mechanism could thus be the result
of this interaction. So, in the absence of a static shell,
one can suppose that the dynamo arises from the cou-
pling of “α”-eﬀect, ω-eﬀect and the BC-eﬀect [38]. With
a static conducting layer, as explained above, the radial
ω-eﬀect is especially strong: the radial dipole, anchored
in the conducting layer and azimuthally stretched by the
toroidal ﬂow (see Fig. 21) is a strong source of azimuthal
ﬁeld. This eﬀect coupled with the “α”-eﬀect could be at
the origin of the dynamo.

For small conducting layer thickness w, one could ex-
pect a cross-over between these two mechanisms. In fact,

16

it appears that the decrease of Rc
m (Fig. 14) with the con-
ducting shell thickness w is very fast between w = 0 and
w = 0.08 and is well ﬁtted for greater w by an exponen-
tial, as in Ref. [32]. We can also note that for typical
Rm = 50, the dimensionless magnetic diﬀusion length
is equal to 0.14. This value corresponds to the
R−
m
characteristic length of the Rc
m decrease (Fig. 14) and is
also close to the cross-over thickness and characteristic
lengths of the Ohmic dissipation proﬁles (Figs. 17, top
and 18).

1/2

We propose to call the mechanism described above a
“shear and shell” dynamo. This interpretation could also
apply to the Ponomarenko screw-ﬂow dynamo which also
merely relies on the presence of an external conducting
medium.

Conclusion

We have selected a conﬁguration for the mean ﬂow fea-
sible in the VKS2 liquid sodium experiment. This mean
ﬂow leads to kinematic dynamo action for a critical mag-
netic Reynolds number below the maximum achievable
Rm. We have performed a study of the relations be-
tween kinematic dynamo action, mean ﬂow features and
boundary conditions in a von K´arm´an-type ﬂow.

The ﬁrst concluding remark is that while the dynamo
without static conducting shell strongly depends on the
bulk ﬂow details, adding a stationary layer makes the
dynamo threshold more robust. The study of induction
mechanisms in 3D cellular von K´arm´an type ﬂows per-
formed by Bourgoin et al. suggests that this sensitivity
comes from the spatial separation of the diﬀerent induc-
tion mechanisms involved in the dynamo process: the
loop-back between these eﬀects cannot overcome the ex-
pulsion of magnetic ﬂux by eddies if the coupling is not
suﬃcient. Secondly, the role of the static layer is gener-
ally presented as a possibility for currents to ﬂow more
freely. But, instead of a spreading of the currents, the
localization at the boundary of both magnetic energy
production and dissipation (Fig. 17) appears strongly re-
inforced. Actually, strong shears in the bulk of the elec-
trically conducting domain imposed by material bound-
aries are the dominating sources of dynamo action. They
result in a better coupling between the inductive mech-
anisms. We also notice that there seems to be a general
value for the minimal dynamo threshold (typically 50)
in our class of ﬂows, for both best analytical ﬂows and
experimental ﬂows with static conducting layer.

The major remaining physical unexplored feature is
the role of hydrodynamical turbulence —far from being
homogeneous and isotropic in such an inertially-driven
closed ﬂow. The presence of hydrodynamical turbulence
could act in two diﬀerent ways: on the one hand, it may
increase the eﬀective magnetic diﬀusivity, inhibiting the
dynamo action. On the other hand, it could help the
dynamo through small-scale α-eﬀect [37]. We have been
nevertheless informed of recent numerical full MHD sim-

ulations at magnetic Prandtl number down to Pm = 0.01
by Ponty, Minnini, Montgomery, Pinton, Politano and
Pouquet. For a Taylor-Green shear ﬂow these authors
announce good agreement between dynamo thresholds
computed for full problem and for kinematic dynamo sim-
ulations of the time-averaged velocity ﬁeld. The VKS2
experiment will operate above the predicted kinematic
threshold Rc
m = 43 and will thus allow to experimentally
answer the question about the role of turbulence on the
instability, and to study the dynamical saturation regime
if it is to exhibit dynamo. Both subjects still remain out-
side any relevant numerical description.

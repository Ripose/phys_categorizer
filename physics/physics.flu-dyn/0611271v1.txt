We consider laminar ﬂow of incompressible electrolytes in long, straight channels driven by pres-
sure and electro-osmosis. We use a Hilbert space eigenfunction expansion to address the general
problem of an arbitrary cross section and obtain general results in linear-response theory for the mass
and charge transport coeﬃcients which satisfy Onsager relations. In the limit of non-overlapping
Debye layers the transport coeﬃcients are simply expressed in terms of parameters of the electrolyte
being the cross-sectional area and perime-
as well as the hydraulic radius
A
ter, respectively. In particular, we consider the limits of thin non-overlapping as well as strongly
overlapping Debye layers, respectively, and calculate the corrections to the hydraulic resistance due
to electro-hydrodynamic interactions.

INTRODUCTION

Laminar Hagen–Poiseuille and electro-osmotic ﬂows
are important to microﬂuidics and a variety of lab-on-
a-chip applications [1, 2, 3] and the rapid development of
micro and nano fabrication techniques is putting even
more emphasis on ﬂow in channels with a variety of
shapes depending on the fabrication technique in use. As
an example the list of diﬀerent geometries includes rect-
angular channels obtained by hot embossing in polymer
wafers, semi-circular channels in isotropically etched sur-
faces, triangular channels in KOH-etched silicon crystals,
Gaussian-shaped channels in laser-ablated polymer ﬁlms,
and elliptic channels in stretched soft polymer PDMS de-
vices [4].

In this paper we introduce our recent attempts [5, 6] in
giving a general account for the mass and charge trans-
port coeﬃcients for an electrolyte in a micro or nanochan-

nel of arbitrary cross sectional shape. To further moti-
vate this work we emphasize that the ﬂow of electrolytes
in the presence of a zeta potential is a scenario of key
importance to lab-on-a-chip applications involving bio-
logical liquids/samples in both microﬂuidic [7, 8, 9] and
nanoﬂuidic channels [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].

II. LINEAR-RESPONSE TRANSPORT
COEFFICIENTS

The general steady-state ﬂow problem is illustrated in
Fig. 1 where pressure gradients and electro-osmosis (EO)
are playing in concert [20]. We consider a long, straight
channel of length L having a constant cross section Ω of
area A and boundary ∂Ω of length P. For many purposes
it is natural to introduce a single characteristic length
scale

R =

2A
P

(1)

which in the context of hydrodynamics is recognized as
half the hydraulic diameter. Indeed, for a circle of radius
R this gives R = R.

The channel contains an incompressible electrolyte,
which we for simplicity assume to be binary and sym-
metric, i.e., containing ions of charge +Ze and −Ze and
equal diﬀusivities D. The electrolyte has viscosity η, per-
mittivity ǫ, Debye screening length λD, and bulk conduc-
tivity σo = ǫD/λ2
D and at the boundary ∂Ω it has a zeta
potential ζ. The laminar, steady-state transport of mass
and charge is driven by a linear pressure drop ∆p and
a linear voltage drop ∆V . With these deﬁnitions ﬂow
will be in the positive x direction. In the linear-response
regime the corresponding volume ﬂow rate Q and charge
current I are related to the driving ﬁelds by

where, according to Onsager relations [21], G is a sym-

which is the well-known result for a channel of circular
cross section of radius R = R ≫ λD.

III. SUMMARY OF RESULTS

In the following we summarize our results for the trans-
port coeﬃcients accompanied by more heuristic argu-
ments before we in the subsequent sections oﬀer more de-
tailed calculations. The upper diagonal element is the hy-
draulic conductance or inverse hydraulic resistance which
to a good approximation is given by

G11 ≈ G∗

hyd.

(4)

While there is no intrinsic length scale inﬂuencing G11,
the other elements of G depend on the Debye screen-
ing length λD. This length can be comparable to
and even exceed the transverse dimensions in nano-
channels [10, 11, 12], in which case the oﬀ-diagonal ele-
ments may depend strongly on the actual cross-sectional
geometry. However, for thin Debye layers with a van-
ishing overlap the matrix elements G12, G21, and G22
are independent of the details of the geometry. For a
free electro-osmotic ﬂow, a constant velocity ﬁeld veo =
(ǫζ/η)∆V /L is established throughout the channel, ex-
cept for in the thin Debye layer of vanishing width. Hence
Q = veoA and

G12 = G21 = G∗

eo,

λD ≪ R.

From Ohm’s law I = (σoA/L)∆V it follows that

G22 = G∗

mig,

λD ≪ R.

For strongly overlapping Debye layers we shall see that

We emphasize that the above results are generally valid
for symmetric electrolytes as well as for asymmetric elec-
trolytes. We also note that the expressions agree fully
with the corresponding limits for a circular cross section
and the inﬁnite parallel plate system, were explicit solu-
tions exist in terms of Bessel functions [22, 23] and cosine
hyperbolic functions [23], respectively. From the corre-
sponding resistance matrix R = G−1 we get the hydraulic
resistance

IV. GOVERNING EQUATIONS

For the system illustrated in Fig. 1, an external pres-
sure gradient ∇p = −(∆p/L)ex and an external electri-
cal ﬁeld E = Eex = (∆V /L)ex is applied. There is full
translation invariance along the x axis, from which it fol-
lows that the velocity ﬁeld is of the form v(r) = v(r⊥)ex
where r⊥ = yey + zez. For the equilibrium potential
and the corresponding charge density we have φeq(r) =
φeq(r⊥) and ρe
eq(r⊥), respectively. We will use
the Dirac bra-ket notation [24, 25] which is mainly ap-
preciated by researchers with a background in quantum
physics, but as we shall see it allows for a very com-
pact, and in our mind elegant, description of the present
purely classical transport problem. In the following func-
tions f (r⊥) in the domain Ω are written as

ciﬁc model we will ﬁrst derive general results which are
independent of the description of the electrolyte.

overlapping Debye layers we note that ¯φeq ≃ 0 so that
Eq. (13) reduces to Eq. (5a) and, similarly since the in-
duced charge density is low, Eq. (14) reduces to Eq. (5b).
For strongly overlapping Debye layers the weak screen-
ing means that φeq approaches ζ so that the oﬀ-diagonal
elements G12 = G21 and the Gconv
part of G22 vanish en-
tirely. In the following we consider a particular model for
the electrolyte and calculate the asymptotic suppression
as a function of the Debye screening length λD.

V. DEBYE–H ¨UCKEL APPROXIMATION

Here we will limit ourselves to the Debye–H¨uckel ap-
proximation while more general results beyond that ap-
proximation can be found in Ref. [6].
In the Debye–
H¨uckel approximation the equilibrium potential
is governed by the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equa-

with bulk concentration co. The Debye–H¨uckel approx-
imation is valid in the limit Zζe ≪ kBT where ther-
mal energy dominates over electrostatic energy. Since we
consider an open system connected to reservoirs at both
ends of the channel we are able to deﬁne a bulk equi-
librium concentration in the reservoirs even in the limit
of strongly overlapping Debye layers inside the channel.
Thus, strongly overlapping Debye layers do in this case
not violate the underlying assumptions of the Poisson–
Boltzmann equation.

D. Asymptotics and limiting cases

1. The geometrical correction factor

In analogy with Ref. [5] we deﬁne a geometrical correc-
hyd/G11 which from Eq. (22a) becomes

Its relation to the dimensionless parameter α in Ref. [5]
is γ = α/(2C) where C = P 2/A is the compactness. As
we shall see γ is of the order unity and only weakly de-
pendent on the geometry so that Eq. (4) is a good ap-
proximation for the general result in Eq. (22a).

1 + (κnλD)2 ,

(24)

For the oﬀ-diagonal elements of G we use that [1 +
(κnλD)2]−1 = 1 + O[(κnλD)2]. In Section VI we numer-
ically justify that the smallest dimensionless eigenvalue

κ2
1 is of the order 1/R2, so we may approximate the sum
by a factor of unity, see Table I. If we furthermore use
that γ ≈ 1 we arrive at Eq. (5a) for λD ≪ R. These re-
sults for the oﬀ-diagonal elements are fully equivalent to
the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski result [23]. For G22 we use
that (κnλD)2[1+(κnλD)2]−2 = O[(κnλD)2], thus we may
neglect the second term, whereby we arrive at Eq. (5b).

The transport coeﬃcients in Eqs. (22a) to (22d) are
thus strongly inﬂuenced by the ﬁrst eigenmode which
may be used for approximations and estimates of the
transport coeﬃcients. As an example the column for γ is
well approximated by only including the ﬁrst eigenvalue
in the summation in Eq. (26). In fact, the approximation
γ ≈ 1 is indeed reasonable.

3. Strongly overlapping Debye layers

B. Transport coeﬃcients

In the case of κ1λD ≫ 1 we may use the result [1 +
(κnλD)2]−1 = (κnλD)−2 + O[(κnλD)−4] which together
with γ ≈ 1 gives Eq. (6a) for strongly overlapping Debye
layers. For G22 we use Eq. (25) and arrive at the result
in Eq. (6b).

4. The circular case

For a circular cross-section it can be shown that [23]

where In is the nth modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst
kind, and were we have explicitly introduced the variable
R to emphasize the asymptotic dependence in Eq. (6a)
for strongly overlapping Debye layers. We note that we
recover the limits in Eqs. (5a) and (6a) for λD ≪ R and
λD ≫ R, respectively.

VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. The Helmholtz basis

Only few geometries allow analytical solutions of both
the Helmholtz equation and the Poisson equation. The
circle is of course among the most well-known solutions
and the equilateral triangle is another example. However,
in general the equations have to be solved numerically,
and for this purpose we have used the commercially avail-
able ﬁnite-element software Comsol Multiphysics [29].
Fig. 2 shows the results of ﬁnite-element simulations
for a particular geometry. The ﬁrst eigenstate of the
Helmholtz equation is in general non-degenerate and
numbers for a selection of geometries are tabulated in
Table 1. Note how the diﬀerent numbers converge when
going through the regular polygons starting from the
equilateral triangle through the square, the regular pen-
tagon, and the regular hexagon to the circle.
In gen-
eral, κ2
1 is of the order 1/R2, and for relevant high-order
modes (those with a nonzero An) the eigenvalue is typ-
ically much larger. Similarly, for the eﬀective area we
ﬁnd that A1/A ≤ 4/γ2
1 ≃ 0.69 and consequently we have
An/A < 1 − 4/γ2

1 ≃ 0.31 for n ≥ 2.

Our analytical results predict that when going to ei-
ther of the limits of thin non-overlapping or strongly
overlapping Debye layers, the transport coeﬃcients to a
good approximation only depend on the channel geom-
etry through the hydraulic radius R. Therefore, when
plotted against the rescaled Debye length λD/R, all our
results should collapse on the same asymptotes in the two
limits.

In Fig. 3 we show the results for the oﬀ-diagonal co-
eﬃcients obtained from ﬁnite-element simulations in the
Debye–H¨uckel limit for three diﬀerent channel cross sec-
tions, namely two parabola shaped channels of aspect
ratio 1:1 and 1:5, respectively, and a rectangular channel
of aspect ratio 1:5. In all cases we ﬁnd excellent agree-
ment between the numerics and the asymptotic expres-
sions. For the comparison we have also included exact
results, Eq. (27), for the circular cross section as well as
results based on only the ﬁrst eigenvalue in Eq. (22b).
Even though Eq. (27) is derived for a circular geome-
try we ﬁnd that it also accounts remarkably well for even
highly non-circular geometries in the intermediate regime
of weakly overlapping Debye layers.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have analyzed the ﬂow of incompressible elec-
trolytes in long, straight channels driven by pressure
and electro-osmosis. By using a powerful Hilbert space
eigenfunction expansion we have been able to address
the general problem of an arbitrary cross section and
obtained general results for the hydraulic and electrical
transport coeﬃcients. Results for strongly overlapping
and thin, non-overlapping Debye layers are particular
simple, and from these analytical results we have cal-
culated the corrections to the hydraulic resistance due to
electro-hydrodynamic interactions. These analytical re-
sults reveal that the geometry dependence only appears
through the hydraulic radius R and the correction factor
γ, as the expressions only depend on the rescaled De-
bye length λD/R and γ ≈ 1. Our numerical analysis
based on ﬁnite-element simulations indicates that these
conclusions are generally valid also for intermediate val-
ues of λD. The present results constitute an important
step toward circuit analysis [20, 33] of complicated mi-
cro and nanoﬂuidic networks incorporating complicated
cross-sectional channel geometries.

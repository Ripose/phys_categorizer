Marginally unstable Holmboe modes

Marginally unstable Holmboe modes for smooth density and velocity proﬁles are studied. For a
large family of ﬂows and stratiﬁcation that exhibit Holmboe instability, we show that the modes
with phase velocity equal to the maximum or the minimum velocity of the shear are marginally
unstable. This allows us to determine the critical value of the control parameter R (expressing
the ratio of the velocity variation length scale to the density variation length scale) that Holmboe
instability appears Rcrit = 2. We then examine systems for which the parameter R is very close to
this critical value Rcrit. For this case we derive an analytical expression for the dispersion relation
of the complex phase speed c(k) in the unstable region. The growth rate and the width of the
region of unstable wave numbers has a very strong (exponential) dependence on the deviation of R
from the critical value. Two speciﬁc examples are examined and the implications of the results are
discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Holmboe instability in stratiﬁed shear ﬂows appears
in a variety of physical contexts such as in astrophysics,
the Earth’s atmosphere and oceanography [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9]. Although the typical growth rate is smaller
than the one of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability it is present
for arbitrarily large values of the global Richardson num-
ber making Holmboe instability a good candidate for the
generation of turbulence and mixing in many physical
scenarios.

What distinguishes Holmboe

from the Kelvin-
Helmholtz instability is that unlike the later instability
the Holmboe unstable modes have non-zero phase veloc-
ity that depends on the wavenumber (i.e. traveling dis-
persive modes). It was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Holmboe [10]
in a simpliﬁed model of a continuous piece-wise linear
velocity proﬁle and a step-function density proﬁle. Sev-
eral authors have expanded Holmboe’s theoretical work
[11, 12, 13, 14] by considering diﬀerent stratiﬁcation and
velocity proﬁles that do not include the simplifying sym-
metries Holmboe used in his model. Hazel [15] and more
recently Smyth and Peltier [16] and Alexakis [17] have
shown that Holmboe’s results hold for smooth density
and velocity proﬁles as long as the length scale of the
density variation is suﬃciently smaller than the length
scale of the velocity variation. Furthermore, eﬀects of
viscosity and diﬀusivity [18, 19], non-linear evolution
[20, 21, 22, 23] and mixing properties [24] of the Holmboe
instability have also been investigated. The predictions of
Holmboe have also been tested experimentally. Browand
and Winant [25] ﬁrst performed shear ﬂow experiments
in a stratiﬁed environment under conditions for which
Holmboe’s instabilities are present. Their investigation
has been extended further by more recent experiments
[11, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].

basic theoretical questions that still remain unanswered,
even in the linear theory. Most of the work for the linear
stage of the instability has been based on the Taylor-
Goldstein equation (see [33]), which describes linear nor-
mal modes of a parallel shear ﬂow in a stratiﬁed, inviscid,
non-diﬀusive, Boussinesq ﬂuid:

and in the range of U there is a height yc, at which
U (yc) = c. At this height yc, called the critical height,
equation (1) has a regular singular point. For some con-
ditions unstable modes exist with the real part of the
phase velocity within the range of U . The phase speed
of these modes satisﬁes Howard’s semi-circle theorem

Although the understanding of Holmboe instability has
progressed a lot since the time of Holmboe, there are still

and c is taken to be c = Umax / min the maximum or min-
imum velocity of the shear layer. The right boundary of
the Holmboe unstable region on the other hand (see ﬁg-
ure 1a) is composed of singular modes with phase velocity
within the range of the shear velocity. These modes can
be determined by imposing the condition that the solu-
tion close to the critical height can be expanded in terms
of only one of the two corresponding Frobenius solutions.
Furthermore it was shown that for suﬃciently large J0
more than one instability stripe exists. These new insta-
bility stripes are related with the higher internal gravity
modes of the unforced system. Figure 1b shows the in-
stability region for R = 3 and J0 up to 80. We note that
diﬀerent unstable Holmboe modes have been found ex-
perimentally in [32] that were then interpreted in terms
of the multi-layer model of [12].

The understanding however of the linear part of Holm-
boe instability for smooth shear and density proﬁles still
remains conjectural and most of the results are based on
numerical calculations and do not therefore constitute
proofs. We try to address some of these issues in the
present work.
In the next section we prove for a gen-
eral class of velocity proﬁles that the modes that have
phase velocity equal to the maximum/minimum velocity
of the shear are marginally unstable. In section III we
examine the case for which the parameter R is slightly
larger than it’s critical value, and the dispersion rela-
tion inside the instability region is derived based on an
asymptotic expansion. In section IV we test these results
for speciﬁc shear and density proﬁles. A summary of the
results and ﬁnal conclusions are in the last section. To
help the reader, a table I with the deﬁnitions of all the
basic symbols used in this paper has been added.

II. MARGINAL WAVENUMBER

In this section we examine modes with phase veloc-
ity equal to the maximum/minimum velocity of the ﬂow,
and show under what conditions these modes constitute
a stability boundary. We start by considering an inﬁ-
nite shear layer speciﬁed by the monotonic velocity pro-

Hazel [15]. It exhibits only Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
k) > J0. Hazel
for the wavenumbers that satisfy k(1
[15] also examined numerically the case R = 5 where it
was shown that along with the Kelvin-Helmholtz unsta-
ble region there is also a stripe (in a J0
k diagram) of
unstable Holmboe modes. As an example the instability
region for R = 3 is shown in ﬁgure 1. Hazel observed
that if R > 2 there is always a height at which the local
Richardson number is smaller than 1/4. Based on this
observation Hazel conjectured that R = 2 is the critical
value of R above which the Holmboe instability appears.
Later careful numerical examination by Smyth [16] found
unstable Holmboe modes to appears only for values of R
larger than R > 2.4. More recently Alexakis [17] showed
that the instability can be found for smaller values of R
up to R = 2.2 making the conjecture by Hazel still plausi-
ble. More speciﬁcally Alexakis [17] showed (numerically)
for the examined shear and density proﬁles that the left
instability boundary of the Holmboe instability region
(see ﬁgure 1a) is composed of marginally unstable modes
with phase velocity equal to the maximum or the min-
imum of the shear velocity. Such a condition has been

We further assume that the layer is stably stratiﬁed with

. In what follows we are going to concentrate
only on the modes with phase velocity close to c = U∞;
the results can easily be reproduced for the c = U−∞
modes by following the same arguments. To simplify the
problem we will non-dimentionalize the equations using
the maximum velocity U∞ and the length-scale α−1 (es-
sentially setting U∞ = 1 and α = 1). The resulting non-
dimensional control parameters for our system are the
J∗/(U∗α)2, the ra-
asymptotic Richardson number:J∞

ﬁnding bounded eigenstates in an unbounded potential
well.

Our aim in this section is to ﬁnd how c changes from
the value 1 as we increase q from the value q0 = k0/α. We
proceed by carrying out a regular asymptotic expansion
by letting q = q0 + ǫq1 and c = 1

sign of the right hand side (r.h.s.) of equation 20 is posi-

a)
not always successful because the product Γ(b)Γ(d

on the value of ˜J. In particular it is shown in the ap-
pendix that if ˜J > 2q/(2q + 1)2 the r.h.s. of equation

20 is negative and thus we end up with a contradiction.
Therefore in the R = 2 case we have shown instability
only if

˜J < 2q/(2q + 1)2.

(21)

The unsuccessful matching when the condition 21 is not
satisﬁed suggests that the modes with q > q0 are part of
the continuous spectrum of the Taylor Goldstein equa-
tion. This kind of modes have a discontinuity of the ﬁrst
derivative of φ at the critical layer and have been studied
before in the literature [39, 40]. We need to emphasize
here that the lack of instability at this order does not
imply stability. Non-zero growth rate of smaller order
can still exist and therefore the above result should be
interpreted only as a suﬃcient condition for instability.
To summarize we have shown that if R > 2 the modes
with phase velocity equal to the maximum phase velocity
of the shear (when they exist, and for density and velocity
proﬁles that satisfy the conditions stated at the beginning
of this section) are marginally unstable: wavenumbers
with q < q0 are stable and wavenumbers with q > q0 are
unstable. If R = 2 these modes are marginally unstable
only if the condition 21 is further satisﬁed and stable (to
the examined order) otherwise.

III. MARGINAL R

≪

In the last sectioned we showed marginal instability
when the wavenumber q is varied from the critical value
q0. However the wavenumber is not a control parameter
in a system. We would like therefore to examine a system
for which one of the control parameters (J0 or R) is close
to the critical value for which the instability begins. Since
Holmboe instability is present for arbitrary large values
of J0 the only other control parameter left is R. We con-
sider therefore a case for which R = 2 + δ with 0 < δ
1
and the c = 1 solution (φ0, q0) is known with q0 such
that J∞ > 2q0/(2q0 + 1)2 so that the R = 2 case gives
no instability at the examined order. We make a small
variation in q = q0 + ǫq1 and c = 1
ǫc1 with the exact
relation between δ and ǫ still undetermined. At this stage
we assume that ǫ is suﬃciently smaller than δ so that the
procedure in the previous section is still valid and then
gradually increase its value until the approximations in
the previous section start to fail. As we increase the value
of ǫ the most sensitive term (in ǫ) that will be aﬀected
(ǫc1/σ)δ in
ﬁrst, is the term proportional to ˜J = J∞
the equation 11 for which ǫ is raised to the smallest ap-
pearing power. Note that if ǫ

or c1/σ < 1. Already at this stage it can be seen that we
have instability only if c1 = 2q1q0I1/I2 < σ and therefore
the instability is conﬁned in the region of wave numbers

q0 < q < q0 + ∆q

(24)

where ∆q = ǫσI2/2q0I1. Therefore, the second insta-
bility boundary for the Holmboe instability is given by
q + ∆q. To get the full dispersion relation in this asymp-
totic limit we need to expand in terms of δ the product
Γ(d
a)Γ(b) that appears in equation 19 since this is
the term that can change sign depending on the value of
˜J. This is done in Appendix B and the resulting growth

growth rate for values of R very close to R = 2.

In the previous sections we showed some general re-
sults for the Holmboe unstable modes. In this section we
examine some speciﬁc examples often used in the litera-
ture to model Holmboe’s instability. We begin with the
model introduced by Hazel that we brieﬂy mentioned in
the introduction. The model assumes a velocity proﬁle
given by U (y) = tanh(y) and a density stratiﬁcation de-
−2(Ry). Based on the def-
termined by
initions given in section II we have that α = 2, β = 2R,
U∗ = 2 and J∗ = 4J0. The resulting non-dimensional
quantities are J∞ = J0/4, σ = 2, q = k/2 and R has
the same meaning. This model satisﬁes all the condi-
tions that are stated in section II therefore for R > 2 the
1 are marginally unstable. Further-
modes with c(k) =
more for the case R = 2 we will have instability only if
the condition 21 is satisﬁed, or in the units of this exam-
ple if J0/4 < k/(k + 1)2. A simple numerical integration
shows that this is not the case for this proﬁle (see ﬁgure
3). Therefore, the R = 2 is stable (to the examined or-
der) and is the critical value beyond which the Holmboe
instability begins. The imaginary part of c(k) for this
proﬁle for the case that R = 2.1 and J0 = 1.2 is shown if
ﬁgure 4 where the numerical result is compared with the
asymptotic expansion of equation 25. Although δ = 0.1
is not very small there is satisfactory agreement (a 20%
diﬀerence) between the asymptotic and the numerical re-
sult. It is worth mentioning that it is very hard to ﬁnd
a range of values of δ that both the asymptotic result
is valid and Im
is large enough to be captured by a
{
numerical code. Note that by decreasing the value of δ
from 0.1 to 0.05 has resulted in a drop of Im
by three

The advantage of this proﬁle is that there are analytic
solutions for the Kelvin-Helmholtz stability boundaries
J0(k) for the cases that R = 0, 1 and 2.
In addition
there is an analytic solution J0(k) for the modes k for
which c(k) = 1 for the R = 2 case. The R = 0 case was
examined by [41] where it was shown that the Kelvin
Helmholtz unstable modes satisfy J0 < k2(1
k2). The
R = 1 case (that reduces to the R = 1 case of the Hazel
model) was investigated by [35] where it was shown that
the Kelvin Helmholtz unstable modes satisfy J0 < k(1
−
k). The R = 2 case has not been investigated before
(to the author’s knowledge). One can show following the
same methods used for the R = 0, 1 cases [35, 41, 42]
that the c(k) = 0 modes satisfy:

The Kelvin-Helmholtz stability boundaries for the three
cases R = 0, 1, 2 along with the c = 1 solutions for the
R = 2 case are shown in ﬁgure 5. For this example we
also have that σ = 2 and q = k/2 but J∞ = 22R−4J0.
The J0(k) relation for the c = 1 solutions does not sat-
isfy the criterion 21 that now reads J0 < k/(k + 1)2, thus
the R = 2 case is stable (to the examined order) and

is the critical value above which the Holmboe instabil-
ity begins. Because J∞ is four times bigger than in the
Hazel model (for the same J0) the resulting growth rate
is smaller by a factor of 4−2λ/δ that is close to 10−14 for
the δ = 0.1 case. Figure 6 shows the growth rate based
on the asymptotic expansion 25. No numerical results
could be obtained for this case for values of δ smaller
than δ
0.1 that would justify a comparison with the
asymptotic expansion. This example, when compared
with one of Hazel, clearly demonstrates the sensitivity of
the resulting growth rate to the large y asymptotic be-
havior of J(y) and U (y): a change by a factor of 4 in
J∞ resulted in 14 orders of magnitude diﬀerence in the
growth rate.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have examined analytically Holmboe’s
instability for smooth density and velocity proﬁles. We

have shown for a large family of ﬂows that the modes with
phase velocity equal to the maximum or minimum of the
unperturbed velocity proﬁle when they exist and if the
parameter R is above the critical value (Rcrit = 2) they
constitute a stability boundary. This result conﬁrms the
results obtained numerically in [17] where the fact that
the c = Umax / min modes are marginally unstable was
only conjectured based on physical arguments. It is also
the ﬁrst time shown analytically that the value of R = 2
for the Hazel model is the critical value Rcrit above which
the Holmboe instability begins.

For the case that the parameter R is only slightly larger
than it’s critical value Rcrit = 2, the dispersion relation
c(k) was obtained based on an asymptotic expansion.
For this marginally unstable ﬂow the growth rate ζ as
well as the width of the instability stripe ∆q have a very
strong dependence on the deviation of R from it’s criti-
cal value. In particular the growth rate ζ and the width
of the instability ∆k = scale as exp[
Rcrit)]
−
and exp[
Rcrit)] respectively (for some positive
constant γ). For this reason the numerical investigations
performed in the past [16, 17] were not able to capture
the instability for values of R very close to Rcrit.

We believe also that the present results go beyond the
clarifying of a mathematical detail in the literature. They
clearly demonstrate the nature of the Holmboe instabil-
ity in a quantitative way. The critical layer for Holmboe
unstable modes appears at large heights where the shear
rate can overcome stratiﬁcation and the behavior mode
will strongly depend on the properties of the shear at this
height. The critical layer is then coupled to the grav-
ity wave modes that their properties are determined by
y =
(1) quantities and are fast enough to travel with the
same velocity as the velocity at the critical layer height.
It is this coupling that gives rise to the instability, and
it is restricted only to the wave numbers that result in a
phase speed that is smaller than the maximum velocity
of the shear but big enough so that the critical layer is at
a large enough height so that Ri(y) < 1/4. Therefore in
any experimental setup, precise measurements of the ve-
locity and density stratiﬁcation are needed in both large
and small heights in order to make comparisons of the
measured growth rate and the theoretical predictions.

O

Finally we believe that the results given in this paper
can provide a basis for further numerical and analytical
investigations such as an examination of the weakly non-
linear theory where a small non-linearity is taken into
account in order to examine the long time evolution of
an unstable mode beyond the linear stage.

not we need to ﬁnd the sign of the imaginary part in the

We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an advected scalar ﬁeld which diﬀuses and
reacts according to a nonlinear reaction law. The objective is to study how the bulk burning rate
of the reaction is aﬀected by an imposed ﬂow. In particular, we are interested in comparing the
numerical results with recently predicted analytical upper and lower bounds. We focus on reaction
enhancement and quenching phenomena for two classes of imposed model ﬂows with diﬀerent ge-
ometries: periodic shear ﬂow and cellular ﬂow. We are primarily interested in the fast advection
regime. We ﬁnd that the bulk burning rate v in a shear ﬂow satisﬁes v ∼ aU + b where U is the
typical ﬂow velocity and a is a constant depending on the relationship between the oscillation length
scale of the ﬂow and laminar front thickness. For cellular ﬂow, we obtain v ∼ U 1/4. We also study
ﬂame extinction (quenching) for an ignition-type reaction law and compactly supported initial data
for the scalar ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that in a shear ﬂow the ﬂame of the size W can be typically quenched
by a ﬂow with amplitude U ∼ αW . The constant α depends on the geometry of the ﬂow and tends
to inﬁnity if the ﬂow proﬁle has a plateau larger than a critical size. In a cellular ﬂow, we ﬁnd that
the advection strength required for quenching is U ∼ W 4 if the cell size is smaller than a critical
value.

INTRODUCTION

Turbulent combustion in premixed ﬂows is a widely
studied topic in both scientiﬁc and industrial settings (see
e.g.
[14, 39, 42]). The interest in the subject is due to
an important inﬂuence that advection can have on the
reaction process: both experimental [13, 47] and theoret-
ical [3, 4, 17, 18, 23, 24, 33, 40, 50, 55] work shows that
the propagation speed of the ﬂame can be signiﬁcantly
altered by the ﬂuid ﬂow. Speciﬁcally, moderately intense
levels of turbulence have the tendency to accelerate the
ﬂame speed v beyond its laminar value v◦. The mecha-
nism and the extent of the ﬂame acceleration depend on
the particular regime of burning [12]. The general rea-
son for the enhancement is that the ﬂuid motion distorts
the ﬂame front, increasing the reaction area. On the
other hand, if the advection is too strong, it can lead to
the ﬂame extinction. The critical strength of advection
which leads to quenching depends on the extent of the
ﬂame, strength of reaction and diﬀusion, and properties
of the ﬂow.

At this stage, it is unreasonable to expect a complete
analytical theory describing the process of combustion in
a ﬂuid phase. Indeed, detailed modelling of the phenom-
ena involves solving a reaction-diﬀusion system involving
temperature (or energy) and concentrations of reactants
coupled with compressible Navier-Stokes equations de-
scribing motion of the mixture [39, 57]. Therefore, most
of the studies in this ﬁeld which seek analytical conclu-
sions use heuristic reasoning or simpliﬁed models, which
may approximately describe the system in certain com-
bustion regimes. Some of the combustion regimes are
relatively well-understood, such as the so-called ﬂamelet
regime, where ﬂame thickness is small compared to the

ﬂuid velocity scales. The geometric optics approximation
where the propagation of the front is ruled by Huygens
principle is often used as a starting point in the analysis
of this regime (see e.g. [34, 38]).

Our goal here is to study one of the most widely used
PDE models of combustion, namely the scalar reaction-
diﬀusion equation with passive advection:

Here T is the normalized temperature, 0

In the absence of ﬂuid velocity Eq. (1) admits ﬂat prop-
agation front with laminar burning velocity of the order
of v◦
κ/τ and characteristic thickness of the order
∼
√κτ . The model (1) can be derived from a more
of δ
complete system under assumptions of constant density
and unity Lewis number (the ratio of material and tem-
perature diﬀusivity), as shown, for instance, in [17]. The
equation (1) has a more general applicability than the
geometrical optics approximation; moreover, as we will
discuss below, the geometrical optics limit can be ob-
tained from (1) in a certain parameter range.

We will consider reaction rates R(T ) of two types, KPP
(Kolmogorov, Petrovskii, Piskunov) [27, 36], and igni-
tion. The KPP type is characterized by the condition
that the function R(T ) is positive and convex on the in-
terval 0 < T < 1. This reaction type is used often in
problems on population dynamics (see e.g. [5, 26]), but
is relevant in combustion modelling, for example in some
autocatalyctic reactions [28]. A reaction term of ignition
type is characterized by the presence of critical ignition
temperature, such that the function R(T ) is identically

zero below ignition temperature. This type of reaction
term is used widely to model combustion processes (see
e.g. [49, 57]), in particular approximating the behavior of
Arrhenius-type chemical reactions which vanish rapidly
as temperature approaches zero.

Our main goal is to gain insight into the question of
how the geometry and the amplitude of the ﬂuid ﬂow
inﬂuence the combustion process. Our study is partly
motivated by recent analytical work [6, 19, 20, 29, 35]
where rigorous bounds on combustion enhancement and
quenching are proved. We test the sharpness of results in
[6, 19, 20, 29, 35], and in addition derive new predictions.
We consider two classes of ﬂows. The ﬁrst is shear ﬂows,
a representative of a wider class of ﬂows, called ”perco-
lating” in [19], which have open streamlines connecting
distant regions of the ﬂuid. The second class is cellular
ﬂow, where the streamlines are closed and the ﬂow con-
sists of isolated cells. For each class of ﬂows, we study
both ﬂame enhancement and quenching.

For ﬂame enhancement study, we consider initial tem-
perature in the form of the laminar front, with T = 1 in
the semi-inﬁnite region behind the front and T = 0 in the
the semi-inﬁnite region ahead of the front. Distorted by
imposed ﬂow, the ﬂame front propagates as a travelling
wave with velocity higher than laminar. The goal of the
ﬂame enhancement study is to obtain relations between
ﬂame propagation speed v and the properties of the ﬂow,
especially for the large advection velocities.

In the case of quenching phenomena, we consider ini-
tial temperature to be non-zero in a ﬁnite region. Since
quenching cannot occur for the KPP-type source term
[43, 44], we use the ignition-type reaction term. As shown
by Kanel, there is a critical size W◦ of initial hot re-
gion below which the ﬂame will be extinguished by diﬀu-
sion alone, e.g. with no advection, when the temperature
drops below the threshold and reaction ceases before the
ﬂame establishes a steady travelling wave conﬁguration
[32]. When advection is present, the ﬂuid ﬂow stretches
the initially hot region so that it can be quenched by
diﬀusion; hot regions of the size much larger than W◦
can be quenched in this manner. Our goal has been to
understand how the geometry and amplitude of the ﬂow
inﬂuence the size of the band W of the initial hot region
that can be quenched.

II. NUMERICAL SETUP AND METHOD

The simulation is set in two space dimensions, in a ver-
tical strip of width L with periodic boundary conditions
in x direction (Fig. 1). In reaction enhancement studies,
the initial temperature was set to T = 1 in the lower half
of the domain and to T = 0 in the upper half of the do-
main. In the quenching studies the initial temperature
was set to T = 1 in a horizontal band of width W in
the center of the domain, and to T = 0 elsewhere. The
interfaces between hot and cold ﬂuid were smoothed to
match the laminar ﬂame thickness.

In the quenching simulations, the size of the cell L/2 was
a fraction of W , so that the initial band always contains
integer number of cells.

Most of the reaction enhancement computations were
done using KPP reaction rate [27, 36] in the advection-

where T◦ represents threshold temperature, below which
R(T ) = 0. In quenching studies we use ignition type re-
action (5) with threshold temperature T◦ = 0.5. Both
reaction rates (4) and (5) were chosen to exactly match,
in the absence of advection, laminar burning velocity
v◦ =
κ/τ . The corresponding laminar ﬂame thick-
ness is in both cases of the order of δ = √κτ ; for KPP
reaction it is several times wider than for ignition.

Equation (1) with reaction rates (4) and (5) has
been solved using a fourth-order explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence
scheme in space and a third-order Adams-Bashforth in-
tegration in time. The grid size was chosen so as to ac-
curately represent the shear across the reacting region:
typically of the order of 12 zones across the ﬂame inter-
face for thin fronts and at least 32 zones per period for

thick fronts. The computational domain extended a con-
siderable distance upstream and downstream from the
burning front so that boundary eﬀects were negligible.
In ﬂame enhancement simulations the overall grid was
remapped following the propagation of the front, thereby
allowing for long integration periods — of the order of
1000 reaction times τ . We found that these long integra-
tions were necessary in order to reproduce correctly the
asymptotic behavior of the propagation speed in the case
of strong advection.

As a measure of the reaction enhancement we use the

The second equality in (6) can be justiﬁed by integra-
tion by parts. The bulk burning rate coincides with the
front velocity in a case where the solution is a travel-
ling wave, but provides a more ﬂexible measure of com-
bustion. Physically, v(t) can be understood as the total
amount of reacted material or the total heat production.
In all simulations done for reaction enhancement, v(t)
approaches an asymptotic value (for cellular ﬂows one
should average in time to arrive at this value) and we
denote this asymptotic value v.

We remark that in shear and cellular ﬂows equation
(1) admits travelling wave-type solutions, called pulsat-
ing fronts (see e.g. [9, 10, 11, 51, 52]). A rigorous stability
theory for these solutions exists but is not complete (see
[53] for a recent review). Except when quenching occurs,
in our simulations we always observed convergence of the
solution to such waves, so the bounds on v also provide
bounds for the propagation speeds of pulsating fronts.

In the quenching studies, we measure the total amount

of burned material per wavelength,

III. SHEAR FLOW: REACTION
ENHANCEMENT

We carried out simulations with the sinusoidal shear
ﬂow with amplitude ﬂow U , and wavelength, L, given by
Eq. (2). In this section we are interested only in reac-
tion enhancement phenomena, and therefore for initial
conditions we consider T = 1 in the semi-inﬁnite domain
y < 0, and T = 0 for y > 0. We carried out computa-
tions for both KPP and ignition type reactions, but did
not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the qualitative behav-
ior. The numerical results presented in this section are
obtained with KPP reaction term (4).

Of special interest is the dependence of the eﬀective
propagation rate v on the velocity amplitude, U , and
wavelength, L, which deﬁnes the characteristic length
scale of the ﬂow (Fig. 2). For small amplitudes, U
v◦,
our results are in agreement with the quadratic law
v◦ + cU 2, which goes back to Clavin and Williams
v
[17] for turbulent ﬂow and has been recently proved rig-
orously for shear ﬂows in [29]. We did not study this
regime in detail since our main interest is in the strong
advection case.

For the amplitudes U

v◦ the results are in good

agreement with the linear law v = aU + b, where the
coeﬃcients a and b
v◦ depend on the geometry of the
ﬂow. In the situation where the scale of the ﬂow is much
larger than the reaction length scale, L
δ, our data
agrees with v = U + v◦. This law has been proposed in
[6] for shear ﬂows which vary slowly compared to the
typical reaction length and rigorously proved in [20] un-
der similar assumptions. For any ﬂuid ﬂow, the regime
δ is closely related to the so-called geometrical op-
L
tics combustion regime [42], the limit where reaction time

perturbed horizontal band with temperature T = 1 sur-
rounded by the ﬂuid with T = 0. This quantity is related
to the bulk burning rate per interface, v(t) = ˙w(t). De-
pending on initial conditions and ﬂow parameters, w(t)
either approaches an asymptotic value, e.g. v(t)
0, or
→
increases with constant rate, that is v(t)
v (for cellu-
lar ﬂow, in the time-averaged sense). In the ﬁrst case we
say that ﬂame quenches; the main objective of quenching
simulations is to determine under which conditions this
happens.

Isotherms within the front in the geometrical optics

and length scales approach zero. In the framework of the
equation (1) this corresponds to the limit κ, τ
0 while
κ/τ remains constant. Indeed, by rescaling equation (1)
with a factor L/δ in space and time, we ﬁnd that the bulk
burning rate v for the original equation (1) is the same
as for equation with modiﬁed diﬀusion and reaction (8)

As L grows, equation (8) approaches the geometrical op-
tics limit.

Quite often, front propagation in the thin front and
fast reaction limit is modelled by Hamilton-Jacobi type
equations. One such model is the G-equation

where the front is deﬁned by a constant level surface of
the scalar G (see e.g.
[38]). The G-equation describes
propagation of the front according to Huygens principle;
that is, the front (i) is transported by ﬂuid ﬂow, and (ii)
propagates normal to itself with the speed v◦. The law
v = U + v◦ can also be understood from the point of
view of geometrical optics since it is easily derived from
the G-equation. Recently Majda and Souganidis pointed
out that the G-equation does not provide the geometri-
cal optics limit of the reaction diﬀusion equation (8) in
a precise sense [25, 37]. However the rigorous bounds
derived for the true eﬀective equation still give the same
prediction for v in the case of shear ﬂow [37].

In the situation where L becomes comparable to δ,
the coeﬃcient proportionality a between velocity ampli-
tude and ﬂame propagation rate is no longer equal to

unity. The rigorous lower bound for v from [35] takes
form v
1+C2n , where n = 2πδ/L. This bound is in
good qualitative agreement with an argument proposed
by Abel, Celani, Verni and Vulpiani [1] based on the ef-
fective diﬀusivity for the shear ﬂow. It is well known that,
if the problem is considered on suﬃciently large time and
length scales, the eﬀect of the advection of passive diﬀu-
sive scalar can often be modelled by eﬀective diﬀusivity
[7, 8]. The expression of eﬀective diﬀusivity in a strong
shear ﬂow goes back to Taylor [48], κeﬀ = κ+ 1
2
where m = 2πδ/l and l is the typical length scale of the
ﬂow. In the presence of reaction, we take l = min(δ, L),
since the advection balances with reaction instead of dif-
fusion if L > δ. This leads to the qualitative prediction
U L/δ if L . δ. We obtained
v
good although not perfect agreement with this predic-
tion. This is not surprising given the heuristic derivation
of the expression for the eﬀective diﬀusivity and its pos-
sible dependence on more subtle geometric properties of
the ﬂow.

Additional understanding of linear dependence v(U )
can be gained from studying the relationship between the
burning enhancement and the structure of the front, in
particular level sets of the temperature. Assume that in
the geometrical optics approximation the front is given
by the function y = f (x); then for the travelling wave
obeying Huygens principle and propagating with speed
v, we have

v = u(x) + v◦

1 + (f ′)2,

where u(x) is proﬁle of the shear, u(x) = U cos 2πx
L . In
the case where u is a mean zero ﬂow, this leads to the
expression

rescaled by a factor of (U/v◦)−1 in the y direction.

geometrical optics limit coincides with a level set of T
(see Fig. 3 for a picture of level sets in a situation close
to geometrical optics). It is interesting to test to what
extent this relationship remains true in the situations
where geometrical optics regime is no longer valid, for
example when L is comparable to δ. We found that for
large U , there is still good agreement between the elon-
gation factor of the level sets of temperature and com-
bustion enhancement (Fig. 4). Moreover, we found that
for large U the temperature distribution across the front
scales with the shear amplitude (see Fig. 5), providing
another explanation of the linear dependence of the bulk
burning rate on the amplitude of the ﬂow. This scaling
behavior can be understood in terms of the approximate
self-similarity of equation (1) with respect to the change
of variables ˜y = y/δ

U/v◦ , ˜x = x/δ, ˜t = t/τ , which gives

The only term which now depends on U is the one pro-
portional to the second derivative in ˜y, and it becomes
negligible in the limit of large U . Indeed, equation (11)
without this term is hypoelliptic, and so addition of the
second derivative term does not constitute a singular per-
turbation. That leads to U -independent propagation rate

reactive Boussinesq system the ﬂow consists of vortices
moving along with the reaction front [54]. However in
the frame moving with the front the eﬀect of such vor-
tical ﬂow is similar to the shear. The prediction for the
reaction enhancement in such system based on the re-
sults for the shear ﬂows appears to be in agreement with
numerically observed behavior [54].

IV. CELLULAR FLOW: REACTION
ENHANCEMENT

Cellular ﬂows have been studied by many authors (see
e.g. [15, 22]), since similar ﬂuid motions appear in many
important applications; classical examples are the two-
dimensional rolls of the Rayleigh-B´enard problem and
Taylor vortices in Couette ﬂow.

For cellular ﬂow simulations, we use a velocity ﬁeld
given by Eq. (3). The ﬂow is controlled by two param-
eters, velocity amplitude U and wavelength L. As in
simulations of reaction enhancement by shear ﬂow, we
consider initial conditions with T = 0 in the upper half
of the computational domain (y < 0), and T = 1 in the
lower half (y > 0). Most of the results presented in this
section were obtained with KPP reaction term (4); the
inﬂuence of the reaction type on the reaction enhance-
ment is discussed at the end of this section.

There are several regimes, which can be classiﬁed ac-
cording to the relations between the characteristic scales
present in the problem. There are three characteristic
time scales: advection, τU = L/U ; reaction, τR = τ ; and
diﬀusion, τD = L2/κ.
In this paper, we mostly stud-
τD.
τR ≪
ied two regimes: τU ≪
The ﬁrst is the regime of strong advection; in the sec-
ond regime advection can be very strong as well, but
is compensated by large cell size L, so that the reac-
tive time scale becomes the fastest in the problem.
If
τD ≪
δ, we have diﬀusive or
small cell regime. The remaining regime corresponds to
v◦. Hence we have
τR ≪
slow advection; this situation is of less interest to us since
U + v◦ under very general conditions [19], so the ef-
v
fect of the advection on the propagation speed is minor.
τD our simulations show
τU ≪
good agreement with geometrical optics models. In Fig-
ure 7 we show a typical picture of ﬂame in the regime
close to geometrical optics. The G-equation, (9), which
is closely related to geometrical optics regime, is invari-
ant under simultaneous rescaling of time and space by
the same factor. This suggests that for ﬂames approach-
ing the geometrical optics limit, one should observe this
similarity, and indeed we do as shown in Fig. 7. The
earliest prediction of the front propagation speed in a
cellular ﬂow for large U within the geometrical optics
framework appears to be due to Shy, Ronney, Buckley
and Yakhot [47]. Using heuristic reasoning, they pro-
posed that v

is proposed in [2] based on more detailed analysis. To
illustrate the origin of this law, let us sketch an argu-
ment providing the lower bound for v. Let us look at the
propagation of the ﬂame tip along the path ABCDE on
the Fig. 8. Assuming that at every point of ABCDE the
ﬂame velocity is given by u(x, y) + v◦, and integrating in
time, we obtain a lower bound

This lower bound, when doubled, gives a very good ﬁt
to our numerical data and is represented by a solid line
in Fig. 9. As one can see in Fig. 7, the tip of the ﬂame
follows the path close to ABCDE, but avoiding corners;
this may account as a factor for the diﬀerence in speed
compared with the lower bound. Our results in the ge-
ometrical optics regime agree with results of [2]; how-
ever we stress that our simulation was carried out for the
reaction-diﬀusion equation (1) using the same numerical
scheme in all regimes, while [2] uses a diﬀerent model in
geometrical optics limit. We remark that in [1, 2] the
possibility of the regime, where τR ≪
τU and v behaves
as U 3/4, was proposed. We could not deﬁnitively con-
ﬁrm existence of such a regime due to the closeness of
(U/v◦)3/4 and (U/v◦)/ log(U/v◦) curves in the range of
tested parameters (Fig. 9).

It should be emphasized that the geometrical optics

regime requires not only the thin front assumption, L
≫
δ, but also fast reaction in comparison with advection,
τU ; in other words, velocity must be limited by
τR ≪
(L/δ) v◦. When this restriction is broken we observe

τR, the sharp temperature gra-
velocity is high, τU ≪
dients appear in the narrow boundary layer at cell bor-
ders (Fig. 13). The thickness of the boundary layer, h,
is determined by the balance of diﬀusion and advection,
κ/h2 = U/L, and is much smaller than δ,

metrical optics.

(This argument is a concise, naive version of the con-
siderations appearing in the derivation of the eﬀective
diﬀusivity in cellular ﬂow, [16, 45, 46, 56].)

to account for slower burning inside large cells. As in the
case of small cells, the ﬂame propagation from one cell
to another is enhanced because of the high temperature
gradient in the boundary layer with width given by ex-
pression (16). The heat coming to the cell through the
cell boundary is distributed on the scale of δ (as opposed
to L, in the case of small L). We further notice that
due to the fast advection, the temperature is essentially
equal along the streamlines inside the cell (see Fig. 12),
which allows the ﬂame to propagate directly from one
boundary layer to another (Fig. 13). That allows us to
write the discrete diﬀusion equation similar to (17), but
replacing averaging in the cell by the averaging in the
strip of width δ along the cell border (δ-layer),

(19)

Here θn is the average of the temperature in the δ-layer
of the n-th cell; and κeﬀ is eﬀective diﬀusivity,

κeﬀ = κ δ/h.

(20)

The temperature in a laminar front varies on the scale
δ, and so estimating reaction in a δ-layer by R(θn) is
justiﬁed. Equation (19) does not take into account the
heat ﬂux from the δ-layer to the bulk of the cell. How-
δ, this heat ﬂux does not enter the
ever, since h
main balance.
In other words, the front described by
(19) propagates entirely in the δ-layers, with the rate
δ/h. Substituting h from Eq. (16)

(21)

The time needed to ignite a new cell, e.g. to warm up
a layer of the size of the order δ in that cell, is equal to
τδ = δ/vδ. Once the width of a warmed up layer reaches
size of the order of δ, reaction becomes capable of sustain-
ing the temperature. Further propagation of the ﬂame
corresponds to the basically laminar front movement in-
side the cell, and takes time τcell

L/v◦.

The total bulk burning rate v is of the order of v◦ times
the number of burning cells, which can be estimated as
the ratio of the cell burning time, τcell
L/v◦, to the
time needed to ignite a cell, τδ = δ/vδ. Therefore the
bulk burning rate is obtained by multiplying the number
of burning cells with v◦, or essentially by normalizing vδ
with a factor of L/δ,

Finally, we would like to mention the eﬀect of the re-
action rate. Similar to the shear ﬂow, we found that the
reaction type does not inﬂuence asymptotic scaling laws
like (15) or (14), although there is certainly a diﬀerence
in the constant factors. However, in cellular ﬂows there is
an interesting phenomenon which is present for ignition-
type but not KPP reactions. The dependence v(U ) is

and period L/δ = 16, 64, 256 (left to right)

≫

For large cell sizes, L

δ, the diﬀusive model (17) no
longer accounts fully for the ﬂame propagation process.
The main objection to the model is that (17) assumes
temperature is uniform inside the cell, and the reaction
term can be estimated at the average cell temperature.
However the numerically observed behavior demonstrates
at ﬁrst sharp temperature gradients at the border of the
cell, later evolving into ﬂame propagation inside of the
cell roughly at the laminar ﬂame speed (see Fig. 13 for
the structure of the front inside cells). Indeed, the cel-
lular ﬂow has no eﬃcient mechanism for mixing between
the streamlines, and the diﬀusion time scale in that di-
rection is of the order L2/κ (practically not enhanced)
[41]. Therefore the combustion process inside the cell
takes time of the order of L/v◦, rather then δ/v◦ (which
corresponds to substituting the average temperature into
the reaction term).

Here, we will modify the eﬀective diﬀusivity model (17)

exhibit a temporary reversal for ignition-type reactions

Sivashinsky [30] and further studied in [31]. We found
that this phenomenon is more pronounced when the re-
action threshold T◦ is closer to unity, in agreement with
the arguments of [31].

V. QUENCHING

In this section we address another eﬀect that advec-
tion can have on the combustion process — quenching.
We say that reaction is quenched if the average tempera-
ture goes to zero uniformly with time. Quenching occurs
in the systems with ignition type reaction when, due to
diﬀusion and advection, temperature drops below the ig-
nition threshold everywhere and the integrated reaction
rate becomes identically zero.

≤

W ∗

If the size of the region is small enough quenching
can be caused by diﬀusion alone, e.g. without advec-
tion, as shown by Kanel [32]. Kanel considered the
κTxx =
one-dimensional reaction-diﬀusion equation Tt −
τ −1R(T ). He found that there exist two critical sizes
W◦
◦ such that if the initial size of the hot region
(where T = 1) is smaller than W◦, reaction quenches,
while if the initial size of the hot region is greater than
W ∗
◦ , two fronts form and propagate in opposite direc-
tions. Two diﬀerent critical sizes are likely an arti-
fact of the proof; in our simulations, we always found
W◦ = W ∗
δ and will refer to the single critical size W◦.
In two and three dimensions, the presence of advection
may lead to stretching of the initial hot spot, thus mak-
ing diﬀusion more eﬃcient at cooling, and consequently,
at quenching.

◦ ∼

In our numerical simulations we study quenching un-
der the inﬂuence of advection, in particular in shear and
cellular ﬂows. As in previous sections, the prescribed
ﬂow velocities are deﬁned by Eq. (2) for shear ﬂow and
by Eq. (3) for cellular ﬂow. For all simulations we used

with L/δ = 4 (bottom). Initial condition was a hot band of the width W/δ = 6 and W/δ = 4 for shear and cellular ﬂow
simulations respectively. Velocities amplitudes are below critical on the left and above critical on the right (shear: U/v◦ = 13
and U/v◦ = 14; cellular: U/v◦ = 600 and U/v◦ = 800). The time is given in units of τ .

the ignition-type reaction (5) with threshold T◦ = 1/2,
since quenching cannot occur for the KPP-type source
term [43, 44]. As the initial conditions we use a hori-
zontal band of width W with temperature above critical
(T = 1) within the band and with temperature below
critical (T = 0) outside the band.

The typical evolution of the system described above is
shown in Fig. 15. We found that the temperature distri-
bution in both for shear and cellular ﬂows evolves accord-
ing to one of the two possible scenarios, depending on the
amplitude of the advection velocity. For lower advection
velocities, after an initial transient period, the system de-
velops solution characterized by a wide, steadily growing
burned region between two wrinkled fronts propagating
in opposite directions. These fronts are exactly as de-
scribed in the preceding sections with regard to structure,
speed, and dependence on the ﬂow properties U and L.
For higher advection velocities, the temperature eventu-
ally drops below T◦ everywhere, after which no burning
occurs. We denote by Ucr the value of advection veloc-
ity which triggers the system between these two scenarios
(further we refer to them as burning and quenching), and
establish the relation between Ucr and the initial condi-
tions and structure of the ﬂow.

We measure the critical value of velocity amplitude
Ucr(L, W ) using the following procedure. For each com-
bination of the initial hot band size W and velocity pe-
riod L, we execute a number of simulations for diﬀerent
velocity amplitudes U . For each simulation we measured
the total amount of burned material per period w(t), de-
ﬁned by Eq. (7), as a function of time (shown in Fig. 16).
The burning systems (with higher velocities, where two
front are formed) are characterized in Fig. 16 by constant,
non-zero slopes, corresponding to constant reaction rate.
These rates are independent of initial conditions, and
are equal to double the burning rate v(U, L), since there
are two fronts. The quenched systems are characterized
by evolving to constant w(t). Both formation of steady

The summary of results for a sinusoidal shear ﬂow is
given in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18. We found that Ucr scales
linearly with W (see Fig. 17),

as predicted in [20], with the coeﬃcient α strongly de-
pendent on the wavelength of the advection velocity
(Fig. 18). Shear ﬂow is most eﬀective at quenching in
the intermediate range of wavelengths, namely when L is
of the order of a few reaction lengths δ. The quenching
mechanism for small and for large L is diﬀerent; one has
to distinguish between the ability of the ﬂow to stretch
the front over the larger scales and to make the initial
hot band uniformly thin.

For small L, the rapid spatial variation of the ﬂow
velocity is well approximated by eﬀective diﬀusion. The
eﬀective diﬀusivity for strong shear ﬂow scales as κeﬀ

For large L, the nature of quenching is related to the
appearance of the (almost) constant regions in the veloc-
L2 for large
ity proﬁle. We observe the behavior Ucr
L, which can be explained in the following way. In order
for quenching to occur, the shear ﬂow should stretch the
initial hot region thinner than Kanel’s critical length (of
the order δ) in time less than the reaction time τ , so that
reaction does not have time to compensate cooling by
advection. The stretching is least eﬃcient near the tip
of the velocity proﬁle. At the tip of a sinusoidal proﬁle,
the diﬀerence between ﬂow velocities at two points sepa-
rated by a distance δ is U (δ/L)2. Therefore we obtain a
suﬃcient condition for quenching Ucr
W , which
leads to

We also examined a degenerate case of shear ﬂows with
a plateau in the velocity proﬁle. For such ﬂows it has
been shown in [20] that quenching does not happen as
soon as the size of plateau is larger than certain critical
size of the order δ and the size of initial bandwidth W
exceeds W◦. As expected, we found that Ucr diverged to
inﬁnity as the size of the plateau approached a critical
value (Fig. 19), in agreement with results of [20]. This
phenomenon can be understood in terms of reaction and
diﬀusion alone: in the region where the proﬁle of the ve-
locity is ﬂat, there is no stretching of the initial hot band.
If the size of the hot band is roughly larger than Kanel’s
critical size W◦, then reaction can compete with diﬀusion,
there will be no quenching, and eventually propagating
fronts will form.

Quenching in cellular ﬂow requires signiﬁcantly higher
advection amplitudes. For relatively small cell sizes

W 4 (see Figure 20). No-
ical velocity Ucr satisﬁes Ucr
U 1/4 for
tice that this correlates with the dependence v
the speed of advection-enhanced ﬂame. This correlation
is not coincidental, and can be explained as follows. The
speed up law indicates that the size of the region where
reaction happens in a stabilized combustion regime scales
as (U/v0)1/4(L/δ)1/4δ for large U. If the width of the ini-
tial band of hot material is of the order smaller than
(U/v◦)1/4(L/δ)1/4δ, advection carries away the energy of
the hot material over the larger region faster than reac-
tion is able to compensate the falling temperature. This
leads to quenching.

We remark that quenching is impossible if the cell size
is suﬃciently large, L & δ, and W & δ. The reason is
similar to the ﬂat plateau eﬀect in the shear ﬂow. Fluid
advection does not provide mixing inside cells in the di-
rection perpendicular to the streamlines, and thus if the
cell is large enough reaction can sustain itself against dif-
fusion. This result has been proved in [21].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We carried DNS calculations of an advected scalar
which reacts according to a nonlinear reaction law. We
studied combustion enhancement and quenching phe-
nomena in two typical classes of ﬂows, shear and cellular.
In a shear ﬂow, we ﬁnd linear dependence v = aU + b of
the combustion speed v on the amplitude of the ﬂow U
in the strong ﬂow regime. The factor a depends on the
relationship between the period of the ﬂow L and typical
reaction length scale δ, is equal to 1 if L
δ and tends to
zero if L/δ
0. The observed behavior is in agreement
with recent rigorous [19] and numerical [1] results. In a
cellular ﬂow we studied primarily two regimes character-
ized by the relationships τD < τU < τR and τD < τR <
τU between diﬀusion, reaction and advection time scales.
We found that combustion speed in the ﬁrst regime is

tics limit, v

large U dominates, we found v
This agrees with the prediction of the eﬀective diﬀusion
model [1, 2, 6] in terms of the power of U but has diﬀerent
dependence the cell size L. We proposed an explanation
of the observed behavior with a modiﬁed eﬀective diﬀu-
sion model where enhanced diﬀusivity is concentrated in
the boundary layers.

∼

As opposed to combustion enhancement, quenching
may happen if the reaction term is of ignition type and
initial temperature is higher than critical in a ﬁnite re-
gion. If the shear ﬂow velocity proﬁle does not have a
plateau of suﬃciently large size, or the size of the cells in
cellular ﬂow is not too large, then for any initial hot band
size W there exists Ucr(W ) such that for U > Ucr quench-
ing takes place. If U < Ucr, two fronts form and propa-
gate with the speed of the developed advection-enhanced

13

front. In the case of shear ﬂow, Ucr depends linearly on
W with a factor α(L)/τ . Quenching is most eﬃcient for
the ﬂows with L on the order of a few typical reaction
lengths δ. For the cellular ﬂows, Ucr scales as W 4. The
results are in good agreement with theoretical arguments.

This paper studies the nature of the eﬀective velocity boundary conditions for liquid ﬂow over a
plane boundary on which small free-slip islands are randomly distributed. It is found that, to lowest
order in the area fraction β covered by free-slip regions with characteristic size a, a macroscopic
Navier-type slip condition emerges with a slip length of the order of aβ. The study is motivated
by recent experiments which suggest that gas nano-bubbles may form on solid walls and may be
responsible for the appearance of a partial slip boundary conditions for liquid ﬂow. The results are
also relevant for ultra-hydrophobic surfaces exploiting the so-called “lotus eﬀect”.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The recent blossoming of research in micro-ﬂuidics has prompted a renewed interest in the
possibility of slip boundary conditions at the contact of a liquid with a solid wall [13, 14]. While
many experiments have provided evidence for a violation of the classical no-slip boundary condition
at small spatial scales [3, 5, 18, 28, 32, 33, 35, 36] the physical mechanisms responsible for this
phenomenon are still unclear. An interesting possibility is the recent discovery of what appear to
be small gas nano-bubbles or pockets attached to the wall [2, 6, 10, 11, 24, 27, 31]. The evidence
for the existence of these nano-bubbles is somewhat indirect, but nevertheless compelling. It is also
hypothesized and, sometimes, experimentally veriﬁed (see Watanabe et al. [33]), that gas pockets
may form in cracks or other imperfections of the solid wall, thereby decreasing the overall wall
stress.

In order to explore the macroscopic consequences of the existence of such drag-reducing gaseous
structures on a solid wall, in this study we consider by statistical means the eﬀective velocity
boundary condition produced by a random distribution of small free-slip regions on an otherwise
no-slip boundary. We consider both the three-dimensional problem, in which the regions are
equal disks, and the two-dimensional problem, in which they are strips oriented perpendicularly
to the ﬂow. While idealized, these geometries provide some insight into the macroscopic eﬀects of
randomly distributed microscopic free-slip regions.

We ﬁnd that, away from the wall, the velocity ﬁeld appears to satisfy a partial-slip condition
with a slip length proportional, to leading order, to the product of the length scale a of the free-
slip islands and the area fraction β covered by them. After deriving a general result, we solve the
problem to ﬁrst order accuracy in β for both the two- and three- dimensional situations.

As discussed in section VII, our results are consistent with those of a recent paper by Lauga &
Stone [14], who assumed a periodic distribution of free-slip patches on a boundary, as well as those
of an older paper by Philip [17] who similarly investigated the eﬀect of free-slip strips arranged
periodically on a plane wall parallel or orthogonal to the direction of the ﬂow.

The present results are also related to so-called “lotus eﬀect” [1] exploited to obtain ultra-
hydrophobic surfaces. Such surfaces are manufactured by covering a solid boundary with an array
of hydrophobic micron-size posts which, due to the eﬀect of surface tension, prevent a complete
wetting of the wall [4, 15, 16]. In the space between the posts the liquid remains suspended away
from the wall with its surface in contact only with the ambient gas and a concomitant reduction
in the mean traction per unit area. Another instance of drag reduction by a similar mechanism
has also been reported in Watanabe et al.
[33]. These authors studied the pressure drop in the
ﬂow of a viscous liquid in a tube the wall of which contained many ﬁne grooves which prevented
a complete wetting of the boundary.

The approach used in this paper is mainly suggested by the theory of multiple scattering [8,
29, 30] and was used before to derive the eﬀective boundary conditions at a rough surface for the
Laplace and Stokes problems [22, 23]

II. FORMULATION

We consider the ﬂow in the neighborhood of a locally plane boundary [37]

with a compos-
ite micro-structure which dictates free-slip conditions on certain areas s1, s2, . . . , sN and no-slip
α=1sα (ﬁgure 1). If each “island” sα is suﬃciently small, and

conditions on the remainder
α=1sα is also suﬃciently small (both in a sense to be made precise later), near the boundary the

It is evident that both ﬁelds vα and wα satisfy
the Stokes equations. In the terminology of multiple scattering, they are often referred to as the
’scattered’ and ’incident’ ﬁelds, respectively [8, 21].

III. AVERAGING

We assume that the free-slip islands are identical circular disks with radius a, centered at yα, with
α = 1, 2, . . . , N . We make use of the method of ensemble averaging and consider an ensemble
of surfaces diﬀerring from each other only in the arrangement of the N free-slip islands. Each
N = (y1, y2, ..., yN ). A particular conﬁguration will
arrangement, or conﬁguration, is denoted by

It may be noted that P (x) is just the number density of free-slip islands per unit surface area

of the boundary; the area fraction β covered by these islands is

where L, assumed much greater than a, is the characteristic length scale for variations of the
number density.

The framework just described can be readily extended to disks of unequal radius, and to non-
isotropic islands such as ellipses. In both cases the probability density would depend on a suitably
enlarged list of variables such as the disk radius, the characteristic size, orientation and aspect
ratio of the ellipses, and so on.

IV. THE EFFECTIVE BOUNDARY CONDITION

boundary, v vanishes everywhere outside s while GW vanishes everywhere. Furthermore, on s, the
tangential tractions also vanish. Hence, upon taking the x1-axis along the normal with x1 = 0 on

It may be expected that, if the islands had an intrinsic direction (e.g., an elliptical shape) and
were not randomly oriented, the tensor Wij would not be isotropic so that the average surface

VI. THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL CASE

The previous analysis can also be applied to the analogous two-dimensional case, i.e. a surface
with a random distribution of parallel, or nearly parallel, free-shear strips of width a oriented
perpendicular to the ﬂow direction. The developments at the beginning of section IV are still valid
and we may start from (22) noting that, in place of (24), we have

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived an eﬀective velocity boundary condition on a wall covered by a random ar-
rangement of free-slip disks or two-dimensional strips. For the case of disks we have found that, to
leading order in the fraction β of the unit area covered by the disks, the velocity satisﬁes a Navier
partial slip condition with a slip length ℓ given by

where a is the common radius of the disks.

One of the motivations of this study was the possibility that gaseous structures attached to the
solid wall, such as nano-bubbles, could furnish a mechanism explaining the partial slip observed by
several investigators and it is therefore interesting to examine how the result (49) compares with
available data. A full comparison would require simultaneous data for ℓ, β and a. The only paper
in which all this information is available seems to be the study by Watanabe et al.
[33], whose
data, according to Lauga & Stone [14] imply a slip length of about 450 µm and an area fraction
13 µm. Rather than disks as in the present study, the
β
free-slip islands in Watanabe et al.’s work were cracks with a width of about 10 µm and a length
of the order 100 µm. If an equivalent radius is estimated as πa2 = 10

The radius of surface nano-bubbles reported by Holmberg et al. [10] is in the range 25 to 65 nm
while that reported by Ishida et al. [11] is of the order of 300 nm. With an area coverage of 20%,
we can estimate a slip length between about 2 and 20 nm. Again, these numerical values are in
the expected range.

Tyrrell & Attard [31] and Steitz et al. [27] measure an area coverage of the order of 90%, which
falls well outside the domain of applicability of our result. Unfortunately, neither group measured
the slip length.

Tretheway & Meinhart [28] measured a slip length of about 1 µm, but made no estimates of area
coverage or bubble size. With ℓ = 1 µm, (49) gives a bubble radius a as large as 3.5 µm even for
β
1, and larger still for smaller β. This is another case for which it would be of great interest to
have some information on the surface structures.

∼

It is also of interest to compare our results with those of Lauga & Stone [14] obtained for ﬂows
in a tube with a periodic arrangement of free-slip rings perpendicular to the ﬂow. For large tube
radius, this arrangement should be comparable to our two-dimensional analysis. Their solution

≤

is numerical, but they provide an approximate analytic expressions valid for large tube radius,
namely

where H is the spatial period. Upon expanding for small β, we ﬁnd

which, with the identiﬁcation Hβ = a, is in precise agreement with our two-dimensional result
(48). Lauga & Stone also give a similar result for free-slip strips parallel to the ﬂow, but this
situation is not comparable with either one of the two that we have considered.

We are indebted with Dr. S.M. Dammer for directing us to many pertinent references. M.S. is
grateful to Prof. D. Lohse for several enlightening discussions and to STW (Nanoned programme)
for ﬁnancial support.

dimensionless variables. It is convenient to adopt a system of cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) in

We introduce a stream function ψ in terms of which

The vorticity ω is harmonic and can be written as a Fourier integral in the form

By introducing the Fourier transform ˜ψ(k, y) of the stream function, substituting into (B6), and

Since the problem for ˜ω− is completely homogeneous, this quantity must vanish so that ˜ω(k) is

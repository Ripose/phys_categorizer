In this work we study the relativistic mechanics of continuous media on

a fundamental level using a manifestly covariant proper time procedure. We

formulate equations of motion and continuity (and constitutive equations)

that are the starting point for any calculations regarding continuous media.

In the force free limit, the standard relativistic equations are regained, so

that these equations can be regarded as a generalization of the standard pro-

cedure. In the case of an inviscid ﬂuid we derive an analogue of the Bernoulli

equation. For irrotational ﬂow we prove that the velocity ﬁeld can be derived

from a potential. If in addition, the ﬂuid is incompressible, the potential must

obey the d’Alembert equation, and thus the problem is reduced to solving

the d’Alembert equation with speciﬁc boundary conditions (in both space

and time). The solutions indicate the existence of light velocity sound waves

in an incompressible ﬂuid (a result known in previous literature [19]). Re-

laxing the constraints and allowing the ﬂuid to become linearly compressible

one can derive a wave equation, from which the sound velocity can again be

computed. For a stationary background ﬂow, it has been demonstrated that

the sound velocity attains its correct values for the incompressible and non-

relativistic limits. Finally viscosity is introduced, bulk and shear viscosity

constants are deﬁned, and we formulate equations for the motion of a viscous

ﬂuid.

1 Introduction

We wish to formulate manifestly covariant equations for the motion of a

continuum on a fundamental level, and to demonstrate their use in an inter-

esting problem. In attempting to reach a consistent theory one meets a few

diﬃculties:

The general motion of a continuum may include accelerations, making

the use of standard special relativistic dynamics problematic. The usual pro-

2

cedure for dealing with an accelerating particle, would be to go from one

inertial frame to the next, as the particle accelerates, always keeping it in-

stantaneously in an inertial frame [1]. In the case of a continuum however,

this procedure is impossible, for each of the inﬁnitesimal volume elements ac-

celerates, in general, at diﬀerent rates and directions, and so only one speciﬁc

portion of the volume can be kept at rest at any particular time. Secondly

the above procedure may not be manifestly covariant, as an accelerating

particle momentarily at rest in some frame, is obviously not equivalent to

an identical particle moving at constant speed. The accelerating particle,

for instance, will be radiating if it is charged. Our claim is that keeping a

particle momentarily at rest can, at best, yield an approximation to the real

motion, but is by no means a consistent covariant treatment of the system.

Another severe diﬃculty in writing down relativistic equations of hydro-

dynamics lies in the relativistic property of simultaneity. In order to deﬁne

an extended body in mathematical terms, a certain conﬁguration of the body

is chosen arbitrarily and is referred to as the reference conﬁguration. In the

nonrelativistic theory, each particle, or inﬁnitesimal volume element of the

body, can then be labeled throughout the evolution by its position in that

reference conﬁguration. The diﬃculty in constructing a relativistic theory

of hydrodynamics lies in the fact that each inertial system will have its own

notion of time and simultaneity, and they will not be able to agree on any set

3

of particles to be considered as existing simultaneously at any given time t. It

therefore becomes impossible to deﬁne a consistent reference conﬁguration.

In 1941 Stueckelberg [2] postulated that events (not particles) are to

be considered as the fundamental dynamical objects of the theory of mo-

tion. The dynamics of an event is governed by 8 independent parameters

consisting of the space-time coordinates2 xµ = (ct, r) and energy momenta

pµ = (E/c, p) associated with each event, and parameterized by an invariant

time. Based on this, Horwitz and Piron in 1973 proposed that there exists

a universal time τ , by means of which dynamical interactions are correlated

[13]. This universal time may be identiﬁed with the Robertson-Walker time

of the expansion of the universe, the time read on a freely falling ideal clock.

The evolution of a system of N events through τ is generated by an invariant

function K on this 8N dimensional phase space, by means of the covariant

Hamilton equations [11]:

The collection of events along each world line corresponds to a particle, and

hence the evolution of the state of the N-event system describes,a posteriori,
2Here and throughout this work we use the usual convention where Lattin indices

i, j, k, ... take the values 1, 2, 3, related to Euclidean space, whereas Greek indices µ, ν, ...

take the values 0, 1, 2, 3 and correspond to the four dimensions of Minkowski space-time

the history in space and time of an N-particle system. In the case of a free

particle, for instance, we choose for the Hamiltonian:

K =

where M is a positive parameter, which is a given intrinsic property of an

event, having the dimension of mass and emerging as the Galilean target

mass in the nonrelativistic limit c

. This results in

otherwise speciﬁed),

in total agreement with the usual Einstein kinematics. As (E, p) are each

taken to be independent variables of the motion, the particles are not nec-

essarily on mass shell, and the particle mass squared: m2 = E2

p2, is not

−

contrained to be constant (except for a free particle), but is rather to be

determined as a solution of the dynamical equations. Note that (we use the

and is unity only for the “mass-shell” value m2 = M 2, Hence τ corresponds

to the proper time of an ideal free clock on its mass shell. On mass shell, the

time obeys the relation:

so that dt is precisely the time interval measured in the laboratory between

two signals emitted by a source, traveling with velocity v, with interval dτ ,

according to the Lorenz transformation. If the emitter is not on shell there is

a factor m/M. The red shift imposed by general relativity, ∆t =

−1
g00 ∆τ is

q

another example of the eﬀect of dynamics, in this case, the acceleration due

to gravity (contained in g00), on the observed time interval. The observed

time interval is therefore inﬂuenced by forces [3] that may move the energy

momentum oﬀ shell.

This theory has since been applied to fundamental questions such as the

Newton-Wigner position operator and the Landau-Peierls relation [4], and to

dynamical problems such as two body bound states [5, 6] and scattering and

electromagnetic interactions in classical mechanics [7, 8], quantum mechanics,

and quantum ﬁeld theory [9, 10].

6

In order to formulate equations of motion for continuous media, we there-

fore turn to the above mentioned procedure of Stueckelberg, Horwitz and

Piron [2], and all following discussions will be conducted in the framework of

this theory. As a consequence of the existence of a universal time which pa-

rameterizes all systems, it becomes possible to deﬁne a certain conﬁguration

of events in space-time X µ, at some deﬁnite initial universal time τ0 = 0,

and then follow the evolution of the system through τ . The universality of τ

eliminates any ambiguity as to the identiﬁcation of events and their distribu-

tion in space-time. Labeling the various events by their initial conﬁguration

X µ, one can thus express their respective positions at any later time τ :

xµ = xµ(X ν, τ ).

The velocity and acceleration of an event labeled X µ at time τ is thus:

V µ(X ν, τ ) =

Aµ(X ν, τ ) =

dxµ(X ν, τ )
dτ
dV µ(X ν, τ )
dτ

=

d2xµ(X ν, τ )
dτ 2

The Eulerian velocity ﬁeld describes the velocities of events passing a certain

point in space-time, as a function of the universal time:

(7)

(8)

(9)

vµ(xγ, τ ) = V µ(X ν(xγ, τ ), τ )

(10)

7

We now wish to express the acceleration in terms of the Eulerian velocity

ﬁeld:

Aµ(X ν, τ ) =

dV µ(X ν, τ )
dτ

=

dvµ(xγ(X ν, τ ), τ )
dτ

aµ(xγ, τ ) = Aµ(X ν(xγ, τ ), τ )

∂xν
∂τ

∂vµ
∂xν =

∂vµ
∂τ

+ vν ∂vµ
∂xν .

(11)

(12)

In space-time, due to mass-energy equivalence, there is no a priori con-

servation of mass of individual particles; rather we shall be dealing with a

“conservation of events”. Let n(xµ, τ ), be the density of events (this quantity

is a scalar since the four volume element is invariant) at the space-time point

xµ at time τ multiplied by M, the intrinsic, given mass dimension property

attributed to each event. Consider now a small volume of ﬂuid. The ﬂux of

events through a closed surface enclosing the volume must cause a decrease

in the density of events within the volume. It is in place to stress at this point

that the surface mentioned is a three dimensional surface, the direction of

which is deﬁned by a four vector normal to that surface in four dimensional

space-time. Hence, for example, we deﬁne dS0 as a volume of three dimen-

sional space, its direction being the time direction. Likewise, the volume over

which the integration is carried out is obviously the four dimensional space-

time. The ﬂux of events past an inﬁnitesimal surface dSµ is: ε(v)nvµdSµ,

8

where ε(v) =

1 depending as to whether vµ is space-like (+1) or time-like

1). The reason for introducing this additional sign is that for vµ and dSµ

both pointing out of the bounded volume, in a time-like direction, the vector

product vµdSµ is negative whereas the ﬂux of events must be positive [19].

and so taking the volume to be inﬁnitely small:

which is the equation of continuity for the ﬂow ﬁeld. Note that in the case

where the density of events n is constant, the above equation reduces to:

∂nvµ
∂xµ = 0,

∂µvµ = 0.

In a continuum we focus on an inﬁnitesimal volume element and describe

the forces acting on it. In general one talks about two kinds of forces:

1. Forces which are proportional to the density of mass, charge or number

of events, within the volume. The force will therefore be nbµ, where n

is the density of events.

2. Surface contact forces, which are exerted by the continuum of events

surrounding the volume under consideration, and are transferred through

its surface. The number of events neighboring a small portion of the

surface, dS, in a locally homogenous ﬂuid, are obviously proportional

to its size, hence we can assume the force to be proportional to the sur-

face it is acting upon. In mathematical terms we assert that the force

df on an element of surface dS tends to zero as dS tends to zero, but

that the ratio df /dS tends to a deﬁnite limit. This assumption enables

us to deﬁne a stress four tensor, the components of which describe the

force in the µ direction, exerted on a surface in the ν direction:

The surface force on an elementary volume unit, in the µ direction is

therefore (by the usual argument):

σµν =

df µ
dSν

.

nf µ =

∂σµν
∂xν

10

(18)

(19)

Summing up the forces acting on an inﬁnitesimal volume element and

equating to the density of acceleration within the volume, we get the equa-

tions of motion:

∂σµν
∂xν + nbµ = n

∂vµ
∂τ

+ vν ∂vµ
∂xν !

 

(20)

By introducing a manifestly covariant Boltzmann equation, Horwitz, Shashoua

and Schieve [15] were able to write down equations for conserved quantities

in a statistical mechanical framework. It is interesting to note that the equa-

tions of continuity and motion derived above from a hydrodynamical point of

view are equivalent to those presented by these authors for the conservation of

some constant quantity and for the conservation of momentum respectively.

In order to make these equations of motion operational it is necessary to

formulate constitutive equations for the ﬂuid. These will deﬁne the way by

which the stress forces acting at a certain point in the ﬂuid σµν, are governed

by its physical state (and/or history). These laws however are determined

by physical properties of the material; we shall make some simplifying as-

sumptions about the nature of the ﬂuid, comparable to those which lead to

the Navier-Stokes equations in the non-relativistic case.

In the following work we shall formulate a potential theory for inviscid,

irrotational, incompressible ﬂuids. Then, relaxing the constraints, we shall

allow the ﬂuid to become linearly compressible, an assumption which will

11

lead to acoustic modes within the ﬂow. Finally we shall introduce equations

for the motion of viscous ﬂow.

2 Standard relativistic limit

In the current section we shall show how Eq. (16) and (20) transform into

the standard relativistic equations of hydrodynamics, which in turn give the

nonrelativistic limit by taking c

. We begin with a few preliminary

remarks which will assist us in what follows. Note the following connection

(23)

Another useful expression which connects derivatives of the velocity ﬁeld vµ

with its nonrelativistic physically observable counterpart vi = cvi/v0, will be

used later and can be proved as follows (we denote by ∂s a derivative with

respect to any variable):

∂svi = ∂s(

) =

∂svi +

∂sv0.

note that any interaction with an apparatus or some macroscopical object

corresponds to an interaction with a worldline, an integration over τ is

therefore necessary.

In performing this procedure to obtain the on shell

limit, we assume that correlations in τ survive only over a short inter-

val, thus a term of the form:

a(τ )b(τ )dτ can be factored to obtain

≈

a(τ )dτ

Applying this procedure to equations (16) and (20) causes the τ derivative

terms in both equations to drop due to the assumption that both n and vα

vanish pointwise as τ

. From Eq. (16) we then get:

(26)

(27)

where all quantities are from now to be understood as being τ averaged.

Written in the form (26), Eq. (16) can be interpreted as expressing the

conservation of energy density (or the continuity of energy ﬂow), whereas the

second form (27) states that the conservation of mass is to be corrected by

a relativistic term. This can be seen by noting that the ﬁrst bracketed term

in (27), is just the regular nonrelativistic equation of continuity which gives

the change in time of the mass of a small volume of three dimensional space.

In nonrelativistic hydrodynamics this term should obviously be zero, for the

mass is conserved. This however is not the case for a relativistic ﬂuid, as an

increase in the energy also has to be taken into account in the conservation

law. This is precisely the meaning of the second term. It expresses the change

1
∆T 2

≈

a(τ )dτ

(25)

14

of energy of the small volume of ﬂuid moving with the particle. This change

of energy causes a corresponding non vanishing change of mass which must

balance it out in such a way that the total be zero.

It should be noticed

that the derivatives of v0 which appear in the second term of (27) are in the

standard relativistic limit, of the order 1/c, and so are small compared to

the ﬁrst term. Therefore when taking the nonrelativistic limit this second

term can be neglected, and one is left with the standard equation for the

conservation of mass:

∂n
∂t

+

∇ ·

(nv) = 0.

(28)

We shall now treat the space and time components of Eq. (20) separately.

We consider a ﬂuid free of any external forces and therefore take b = 0. For

the sake of simplicity of notation we assume here that σµν =

pgµν. A

−

physical justiﬁcation for this simpliﬁcation will be forthcoming in the next

section, but the generality of our following discussion is not based on or

restricted by it. Taking the time component we have:

where we made use in the third line of the equation of continuity (28). Eq

(30) is evidently an equation for the change in nonrelativistic kinetic energy.

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side can be interpreted as the change of

kinetic energy within a small volume of space whereas the second term is the

ﬂux of energy leaving that volume.

Turning to the space components, and using relation (24) we get:

By remembering relation (22) one can notice at once that the left hand side

of Eq. (32) is simply the physical force acting on an inﬁnitesimal volume of

ﬂuid, whereas the right hand side gives the rate of change of the physical

velocity moving with the ﬂuid.

In fact it can clearly be seen that in the

nonrelativistic limit c

1, Eq. (32) simply becomes the non-

relativistic Euler’s equation of hydrodynamics. It is worth noting too, that if

we accept a correspondance between the density of events n and the sum of

the internal energy and pressure w = ε+p (also called the heat function), then

Eq. (32) is precisely equivalent to the relativistic hydrodynamics equation

derived by Weinberg [14] and Landau [17] in the forceless events framework

of standard relativity for which (v0/c)2 = γ2.

3 Potential Theory for Relativistic Hydrody-

namics

Under certain circumstances some problems in ﬂuid dynamics can be solved

in an approximation in which viscous forces are neglected, and the ﬂuid is

assumed to be incapable of sustaining shear forces. If the ﬂuid is assumed

also to be spatially and temporally isotropic, we can write down the stress

where gµν is the metric tensor for ﬂat Minkowski space and p is a Lorentz

scalar. The interpretation of the stress tensor components in this form, is as

follows: The three space-space components relate to the force exerted within

the ﬂuid per unit surface per unit time, whereas the time-time component

describes the forces acting in the time direction per unit volume of the ﬂuid

(essentially mass-changing forces).

Substituting Eq. (33) into the equations of motion,

∂µσµν + nbν = n(

+ vµ∂µ)vν,

(34)

this leads to

∂νp + nbν = n(

An important kinematic result which shall be used later, is known as the

Circulation Theorem. Consider a closed circuit C linking a continuous line of

ﬂuid events. In general the space-time conﬁguration of the loop C depends

on τ . We denote this symbolically by Cτ . The kinematic Theorem to be

proven is :

So then:

where aµ is the space-time acceleration ﬁeld of the ﬂuid. The proof can be

(17) that for an incompressible ﬂuid

so combining the two, we ﬁnd that the velocity potential, Φ, satisﬁes the

d’Alembert equation:

providing an enormous simpliﬁcation in the theory of inviscid irrotational

ﬂow. Using the four dimensional Stokes theorem [21] we can convert the line

integral in Eq. (44) into a spatial integral:

vµdxµ =

(∂µvν −

∂νvµ)dSµν = 0.

If this is to be true for arbitrary surface S, the integrand must vanish, giving

Using this we can evaluate the following expression:

We return now to Eq. (47) and assert that under the assumptions made,

our problem reduces to solution of the d’Alembert equation, given speciﬁc

boundary conditions. These require that the component of the velocity ﬁeld

procedure as does the Bernoulli equation in the nonrelativistic counterpart.

normal to the boundary vanish everywhere on its surface. Thus the motion of

the ﬂuid will be governed solely by the space-time geometry of the problem.

The solution can then be inserted back into the equations of motion (53),

determining the distribution of forces and stresses within the ﬂuid.

The general solution to the d’Alembert equation (47), can be written as

an integral over all possible plane waves:

Φ =

d4kA(kµ) exp(ikµxµ),

Z

where kµ is restricted to the shell

kµkµ = 0,

(54)

(55)

and the A(kµ) which determine the shape of the wave packet are to be de-

termined by boundary and initial conditions.

It must be noted though, that there also always exists another trivial

solution, because any solution to the Laplace equation with an additional

linear time term, will also satisfy the d’Alembert equation. The space part,

Φ∇, by deﬁnition, vanishes under the Laplacian, while the time component

being linear, vanishes when diﬀerentiated twice. This trivial solution

ΦN R = Φ∇ + u0x0,

(56)

gives rise to a physical velocity ﬁeld:

which is clearly to be interpreted as the nonrelativistic ﬂow of an incompress-

As for the physical motion of the ﬂuid we now have:

The ﬁrst term is just the nonrelativistic, t independent ﬂow of Eq.

(57),

whereas the other two are of a smaller order and describe time dependent

wave-like ﬂuctuations. It seems, then, that the covariant form for the po-

tential ﬂow gives rise to a physical velocity which can be divided into two

24

parts v

vN R + vR, an underlying nonrelativistic velocity ﬁeld and an addi-

≈

tional relativistic correction with a wave-like nature, due to disturbances in

the background ﬂow. These disturbances can be envisioned as ripples riding

above the usual nonrelativistic ﬂow, at a speed which will be shown to be

the speed of light.

The velocity of the disturbances can be calculated in various ways. Writ-

ing kµ = knµ in Eq. (54), and picking out a speciﬁc direction nµ, we can

perform the integration over the magnitude k, getting:

Φ = f (nµxµ).

(61)

But from relation (55), nµnµ = 0, so the phase velocity vf , of the wave front

is:

where in the last step we used relation (55).

It is in point to stress that it is not the ﬂuid which ﬂows with the speed of

light, rather it is the disturbances propagating in the ﬂow ﬁeld which travel

with the above calculated group and phase velocities.

In previous work on the subject, there has been much debate as to the ac-

tual deﬁnition of incompressibility of relativistic ﬂuids. The most straight for-

ward deﬁnition in the framework of standard relativity, would be to demand

that an element of the ﬂuid shall retain the same proper volume throughout

its motion, or in other words that the expansion of an elementary world-tube

of liquid shall be zero. The diﬃculty lies in the fact that this deﬁnition yields

inﬁnite sound wave velocities. This would violate the most basic assumptions

of standard relativity which forbids any material particle or information to

be propagated at a speed higher than light. A disturbance such as a sound

wave does carry energy, momentum and information and should therefore

not break the light speed barrier. For this precise reason Synge [22] intro-

duced two more alternate deﬁnitions, the second of which actually deﬁnes an

26

incompressible ﬂuid as such that sound waves propagate within it at light

velocity.

In comparison, the equations we have written down and the simple as-

sertion that incompressibility is to be deﬁned on events in four dimensional

space-time, lead smoothly and naturally to light speed sound waves in agree-

ment with Synge’s criterion. Moreover it can be seen that as c

, the

→ ∞

sound waves speed, tends to inﬁnity too, as would be expected of an incomm-

presible ﬂuid in the nonrelativistic limit.

4 Compressible ﬂuid, Acoustic approximation

We wish to widen the scope of our study to encompass the behavior of a

compressible ﬂuid, and we shall show that this additional freedom introduces

acoustic modes with sound velocities other than that of light.

We begin by assuming that the density and pressure vary only slightly

from some constant values.

n = n0 + n′,

p = p0 + p′.

(65)

Generally the pressure is a function of the density so one can expand the

pressure in a Taylor series:

27

p(n) = p(n0) + n′ ∂p(n0)
∂n

= p(n0) + u2n′

(66)

where higher derivatives in n have been neglected and we have in the last

stage denoted the constant u2 = dp(n0)

dn . Comparing equations (65) and (66)

we get a linear relationship between the variations of density and pressure,

p′ = u2n′.

(67)

We wish also to assume the three space components of the velocity ﬁeld to

be, in some sense, small. The time component on the other hand must by

deﬁnition be of the order of c and can therefore not be considered small. This

reasoning leads us to divide the velocity ﬁeld too into two parts,

vµ = vµ

0 + v′µ,

(68)

where vµ

0 = (v0, 0, 0, 0) is a constant5, pure, time-like vector and v′µ is a small

perturbation the nature of which we wish to determine. It has been shown

earlier that the motion of the ﬂuid, neglecting unimportant body forces, is

governed by the following two equations:

∂µp = n

−

∂vµ
∂τ

 

+ vν∂νvµ

!

(69)

5It is suﬃcient if v0 varies only slowly in spacetime relative to v′µ; this possibility will

be discussed later on.

28

n∂µvµ =

+ vµ∂µn

−

∂n
∂τ

(70)

We assume ﬁrstly, that all changes in τ in equations (69) and (70), are

negligably small compared with the spacetime changes, and we can therefore

omit the τ derivatives from both equations. This can be explained too on

grounds of integrating the above equations over τ and asserting that all

physical quantities vanish as τ

or by taking the zero component of

→ ±∞

the frequencies in τ . All three arguments are essentially equivalent and are

based on the fact that any apparatus in the laboratory is not capable of

resolving fast changes in τ , but can rather only measure averages over large

periods of the universal time. The resulting equations

can now be linearized by inserting relations (65) and (68) and keeping only

terms of the ﬁrst order (n′, p′ and v′µ being of the ﬁrst order). Higher order

terms are neglected and so in this approximation the two equations reduce

to

∂µp = nvν∂νvµ,

n∂µvµ = vµ∂µn,

where by remembering relation (67), we have eliminated p′ from equation

(71). The importance of the background vector vµ

0 , now becomes apparent.

It ensures that the velocity ﬁeld remains time-like and that the large time-like

component does not get neglected in the linearization process.

By taking space derivatives of Eq. (73) it can be shown that

0 ∂σ(∂µvν −
vσ

∂νvµ) = 0,

(75)

implying that if the ﬂow was initially irrotational everywhere, then it will

remain so throughout the entire evolution and that the velocity ﬁeld can be

derived from a potential:

(76)

(77)

vµ =

∂µΦ.

−

Multiplying Eq. (73) by v0µ one obtains

u2vµ

0 ∂µn′ = n0v0µvν

0 ∂νv′µ,

−

where we have interchanged the raising and lowering of the indices on the left

hand side. The equations can now be solved for gradients of v′µ by inserting

Eq. (74) into (77):

u2∂µv′µ = vν

0 v0ν∂νv′µ.

(78)

30

Using relation (76) to replace the velocity ﬁeld by the derivative of its po-

tential Φ, and rearranging terms, we get

∂µ −

Before resuming with an interpretation of the result (80), we wish to

identically zero and we are left with the following relationship

n′ =

We now return to Eq. (80), and assume for simplicity that the background

This is a wave equation for which the modiﬁed sound velocity is

and we can investigate the various limits as follows. When we take the ﬂuid to

its noncompressible limit, or mathematically u

5 Viscous ﬂuids

Until now we have dealt solely with “ideal ﬂuids” which do not sustain shear

stresses during motion. The justiﬁcation for our previous equations was

that for many materials the shear stresses occurring during motion are small

compared with the pressure. In practice though, all liquids and gases are in

fact able to sustain shear forces, and we now wish to take these into account

in a consistent covariant manner. In order to obtain equations describing the

motion of a viscous ﬂuid, we have to include some additional terms in the

constitutive equations of the ﬂuid. We therefore write the stress tensor σµν

in the form

σµν =

pgµν + ˆσµν.

−

(87)

The second term is the extra stress tensor or viscosity stress tensor resulting

from frictional forces between diﬀerent layers of ﬂuid. We can, with some

restrictive assumptions, establish a general form for the tensor ˆσµν. If we

assume that our ﬂuid does not “remember” its past history or initial con-

ﬁguration but rather that its motion is governed solely by the immediately

preceding state, then ˆσµν, must depend only on the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid.

Processes of internal friction occur in a ﬂuid only when diﬀerent ﬂuid parti-

cles move with diﬀerent velocities, so that there is a relative motion between

various parts of the ﬂuid. On the other hand if the distances between ad-

33

jacent parts of the ﬂuid are kept constant during the motion and assuming

that forces between events are a function of the distance separating them

∆xµ∆xµ, then there will be no friction.

In other words a frictional dissi-

pation could arise only in those regions of the ﬂuid continuum undergoing

distortion, excluding places at which the ﬂuid moves uniformly as a rigid

body. Hence ˆσµν must depend on derivatives of the velocity ﬁeld rather than

the velocity ﬁeld itself. When the velocity gradients are small we can, to

some approximation, suppose ˆσµν to be a linear function of the derivatives

∂µvν omitting higher orders of powers and derivatives. There can be no terms

independent of ∂µvν, since ˆσµν must vanish for constant vµ.

A rigid rotation of the ﬂuid in space time must also be excluded from

aﬀecting the viscous force, and we shall show that this implies that only the

symmetric combination of derivatives ∂µvν + ∂νvµ, can be contained in ˆσµν.

We must note here that by rigid rotation in spacetime, we mean the group

of transformations Λµν, which keep the covariant distance dxµdxµ constant.

This is precisely the group of pure Lorentz transformations, which fulﬁll the

requirement

ν = gµ

(88)

We can show quite generally that for an inﬁnitesimal transformation Λµ

ν =

34

ν, must be antisymmetric,

as follows:

parison of Eq. (89) with (88) yields

−

proving the antisymmetry of εµ

γ.

Consider now a small region in the ﬂow around a point xµ

c , at which the

ﬂuid can locally be considered to be rotating rigidly (ﬁgure 2). Our claim

is that at xµ

c there are no frictional forces within the ﬂuid and therefore the

the viscosity stress tensor must vanish at that point. Let Ωµ

ν represent the

angular velocity of the ﬂuid rotating in the µ

ν plane. The velocity ﬁeld

−

round xµ

c will then by deﬁnition be

vµ = Ωµ

νxν,

(91)

35

where xν here and in the following discussion is the displacement from the

center of rotation xµ

c . Now consider a ﬂuid particle at some place xµ being

rotated by an inﬁnitesimal amount to a new position x′µ. There are two

relations connecting x and x′:

where

x′µ = Λµ

νxν,

x′ν = xν + δτ vν,

Λµ

ν = gµ

is an inﬁnitesimal Lorenz transformation. Inserting Eq. (91) into (93), and

comparing with Eq. (92) results in

Λµ

ν = gµ

ν + δτ Ωµ

ν

Using relation (94) we can get a form for Ωµ

ν in terms of εµ

ν

proving that Ωµ

ν too, is antisymmetric. Taking derivatives of relation (91)

while considering the fact that Ωµ

ν is antisymmetric shows that the combi-

ν,

36

(94)

(95)

(96)

nation ∂µvν + ∂νvµ vanishes for a rigidly rotating ﬂuid whereas the antisym-

metric combination ∂µvν

∂νvµ, does not. As the viscosity stress tensor ˆσµν

−

must vanish for rigidly rotating motion, we deduce that it must contain just

the symmetric combination of derivatives.

The most general tensor of rank two satisfying all the above conditions is

ˆσµν = a(∂µvν + ∂νvµ) + bgµν∂γvγ,

(97)

where a and b are independent of the velocity. It is convenient, however, to

replace a and b by other constants and write the equation in another form

which lends itself more readily to interpretation

ˆσµν = η(∂µvν + ∂νvµ

gµν∂γvγ) + ζgµν∂γvγ.

(98)

1
2

−

We shall call the constants η and ζ the shear viscosity and bulk viscosity

respectively. The terminology derives from considering the two following

basic ﬂows (see ﬁgure 3):

1. For a “pure” shear ﬂow vµ = u(n′

γxγ)nµ, where nµ and n′µ are mutually

orthogonal unit vectors so that the direction of the velocity gradient n′µ

is perpendicular to the direction nµ of the velocity, it can be shown that

only the ﬁrst term in ˆσµν survives, leaving ˆσµν = uη(nµn′ν + n′µnν).

So the coeﬃcient η alone governs the resistance of the ﬂuid to shear

distortions.

37

2. For a “pure” radial ﬂow vµ = (u/4)xµ in which the material expands

in a radial direction, the the ﬁrst term in Eq. (98) vanishes leaving

ˆσµν = uζgµν, which shows that ζ is proportional to the resistance of

the ﬂuid to expansion of bulk. This can be understood also by noticing

that the expression in parentheses in Eq.

(98) has the property of

vanishing on contraction with respect to µ and ν.

The equations of motion can now be obtained by adding the expressions

∂ν ˆσµν to the left hand side of the nonviscous ﬂow equation (69). Thus we

have

∂µp+∂ν

∂µvν + ∂νvµ

This is the most general form of the equations of motion of a viscous ﬂuid.

If we assume, however, that the viscosity coeﬃcients do not change notice-

ably throughout the ﬂuid, then they may be regarded as constant and can

therefore be taken outside the gradient operators. We then have

Further simpliﬁcation can be obtained by assuming the bulk viscosity ζ small

(101)

On solving a speciﬁc dynamical problem one must also write down the

boundary conditions for the equations of motion of a viscous ﬂuid. We as-

sume that there are friction forces acting between the boundary surface and

the ﬂuid such that the layer of ﬂuid immediately adjacent to the boundary

is brought to complete rest. Accordingly, the boundary conditions on the

equations of motion require that the ﬂuid velocity should vanish at ﬁxed

solid surfaces:

vµ = 0.

(102)

We emphasize that for a viscous ﬂuid both the normal and tangential velocity

components must vanish, in contradistinction to ideal ﬂuids for which it is

required only that the normal component vanish.

In a general case with

boundaries moving in τ , the velocity of the ﬂuid at the boundary should be

equal to the velocity of the moving surface.

39

6 Conclusions

We have studied a continuum ﬂow of events in space-time parameterized

by τ , the invariant, universal, historical time. In the process of evolution,

as τ changes uniformly, the events move in space-time, generating a dense

continuum of world lines which constitute a physical ﬂow of particles. The

velocity ﬁeld is in general a function of both space-time and τ and is governed

by equations of motion and continuity. The solution of the equations for the

velocity ﬁeld provides, in principal, a solution to the physical problem, but

is in general rather complicated.

We considered an inviscid ﬂuid and derived an analogue of the Bernoulli

equation. In the special case of irrotational ﬂow we proved that the velocity

ﬁeld can be derived by a potential. If in addition, the ﬂuid is incompressible,

it has been shown that the potential must obey the d’Alembert equation,

and thus the problem is reduced to solving the d’Alembert equation with

speciﬁc boundary conditions. The solutions consist of a background ﬂow

(The nonrelativistic solution) over which wave like ripples propagate with

group and phase velocities equal to that of light. This is to be compared

with Synge [19], who actually deﬁnes noncompressibility in such a way as to

achieve this result.

Relaxing the constraints and allowing the ﬂuid to become linearly com-

40

pressible one can derive a wave equation, from which the sound velocity can

again be computed. For a stationary background ﬂow, it has been demon-

strated that the sound velocity, attains its correct values for the incompress-

ible and nonrelativistic limits.

It is in principal possible, under some re-

strictions, to compute the sound velocities also for a non stationary and

non uniform background ﬂow. Precise computations and predictions in this

direction are yet to be studied.

Finally viscosity was introduced and the use of some general arguments of

symmetry and isotropy enabled the formulation of equations for the motion

of a viscous ﬂuid. Only introductory comments were made about this topic

and the equations derived are yet to be applied to speciﬁc problems.

It must be emphasized that the velocity and density (and any other) ﬁelds

that we mention, describe quantities related to the ﬂow of events at a par-

ticular time τ . In order to derive a physically observable quantity related to

particles, an averaging must be performed over τ . The method we use is that

of integrating over τ with the density of events as a weight function. An ex-

act transcription from event properties to world-line, or particle, properties,

however, is not always possible due to nonlinearities of these quantities. Al-

ternatively the observed quantities can be extracted from the zero frequency

(in τ ) components of the ﬁelds.

[11] A phase space of 8n dimentions for an n particle system has been su-

jested by J. L. Synge, The Relativistic Gas. (Amsterdam, 1957), but he

does not show how to construct a dynamical theory on this basis.

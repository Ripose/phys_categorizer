Traditionally, trends of universal turbulence statistics are presented versus Rλ, which is the
Reynolds number based on Taylor’s scale λ and the root-mean-squared (rms) velocity urms.
λ
and urms, and hence Rλ, do not have the attribute of universality. The ratio of rms ﬂuid-particle
acceleration to rms viscous acceleration, Ra, and the ratio of rms pressure-gradient acceleration to
rms viscous acceleration, R∇p, are alternatives to Rλ that have the advantage of being determined
by the small scales of turbulence. These ratios have the following attributes: Ra is a Reynolds
number, Ra and R∇p are dimensionless, are composed of statistics of the small scales of turbulence,
can be evaluated with single-wire hot-wire anemometry, and like Rλ, can be partially evaluated by
means of ﬂow similarity. Experimental data have shown R∇p and Ra with Rλ on the abscissa;
those graphs show the nonuniversal behavior of Rλ for a variety of ﬂows.

I. INTRODUCTION

Reynolds [1] sought, from the Navier-Stokes equation, “the dependence of the character of motion on a relation
between the dimensional properties and the external circumstances of motion.” Assuming that the motion depends
on a single velocity scale U and length scale c, Reynolds found that the accelerations are of two distinct types
and thereby deduced that the relevant solution of the Navier-Stokes equation “would show the birth of eddies to
depend on some deﬁnite value of cρU/µ,” [1] where ρ is the mass density of the ﬂuid and µ is the coeﬃcient of
viscosity. Reynolds performed exhaustive experiments that demonstrated his deduction, as well as experiments on
the stabilization of ﬂuctuating ﬂow. [1] He discovered the sudden onset of ﬂow instability [1]. The Navier-Stokes
equation is a = ∂u/∂t+u·∇u = −∇p+ν∇2u, where p is pressure divided by ρ, ν = µ/ρ is kinematic viscosity, u is the
velocity vector, and a is the acceleration. Batchelor [2] discussed (in his Sec. 4.7) the interpretation of the Reynolds
number as a measure of a relative to the viscous term ν∇2u. He noted that the balance of the Navier-Stokes equation
can also be parameterized in terms of the relative magnitudes of ∇p and ν∇2u. The latter parameterization does
not technically lead to a Reynolds number, but it will be shown that the two parameterizations become equivalent at
large Reynolds numbers.

To paraphrase Nelkin’s [3] description of Reynolds number scaling:

if two turbulent ﬂows have the same
geometry and the same Reynolds number, then their statistics, when appropriately scaled, should be equal. A
statistic of the small scales of turbulence is an average of quantities that contain only products of diﬀerences, such as
two-point velocity diﬀerence or derivatives of velocity. Universality of the small scales of turbulence is the hypothesis
that statistics of the small scales, when appropriately scaled, should become equal as Reynolds number increases [3]
[4]; that is, the ﬂow geometry becomes negligible in the limit that the Reynolds number is inﬁnite. Discovering the
appropriate scaling that results in universality is the topic of a vast amount of research [3] [4] and will not be pursued
here. The relevance of universality to real turbulent ﬂows is discussed by Nelkin [3] and Sreenivasan and Antonia [4].
The Reynolds number based on the root-mean-square (rms) of the longitudinal-velocity component urms ≡

and Taylor’s length scale λ is Rλ ≡ urmsλ/ν, where ν is kinematic viscosity, and λ ≡ urms/

(cid:10)
angle brackets denote an average. Here, u1 and x1 are the components of velocity and spatial coordinate in the
direction of the 1-axis; λ is the spacing (i.e., the distance between two points) at which the two-term Taylor-series
expansion of the two-point correlation of u1 equals one-half of its value at the origin. [5] Thus, λ and urms are natural
scales for presenting measurements of the velocity correlation function for isotropic turbulence. For decades, Rλ has
been used as the abscissa for presenting statistics that are believed to be universal aspects of small-scale turbulence
). The observed trends as Rλ increases
(such as velocity derivative statistics normalized by powers of
are an often-sought quantiﬁcation of scaling universality. Rλ has the advantage of being easily measured because
it requires only measurement of u1 (which yields ∂u1/∂x1 by means of Taylor’s hypothesis); that measurement can
be obtained with a single hot-wire anemometer. Alternatively, ﬂow similarity can be used to estimate the energy
dissipation rate ε, and by substituting the local-isotropy relationship that ε = 15ν
, Rλ can be obtained

rms/ (εν/15)1/2. Because Rλ depends on urms, it depends on large-scale geometry of the ﬂow. Nelkin
from Rλ = u2
[3] discussed the nonuniversal attributes of Rλ. As a result of the nonuniversality of Rλ, statistics of the small scales,
e.g., normalized derivative moments, when graphed with Rλ on the abscissa, can have diﬀerent curves corresponding
to dissimilar ﬂows. One example is the derivative moments shown in Fig. 6 by Belin et al. [6], which shows a
distinctly diﬀerent trend in the limited range of Rλ = 700 to 1000 for the ﬂow between counter-rotating blades as
compared to data from wind tunnels and the atmospheric surface layer; the latter data is summarized by Sreenivasan
and Antonia (1997). Another example is Fig. 2 (curves c, g, f only) of Gotoh and Rogallo [7], which shows that DNS
of diﬀering ﬂows produces diﬀerent curves for normalized acceleration variance when Rλ is the abscissa. Because of
the nonuniversality of Rλ there is no requirement that the curves lie upon one another.

II. ALTERNATIVES

In addition to graphing such statistics with Rλ on the abscissa, it would seem advantageous to use a quantity
on the abscissa that is solely a property of the small scales of turbulence. That advantage has long been recognized.
[8] [9] [10] Here, we seek a small-scale quantity that has the meaning of a Reynolds number, and it must be measurable
with an instrument no more complex than a single-wire hot-wire anemometer. Consider the two ratios:

Subsequent studies of the inertial-range exponents of structure functions cast some doubt on the uni-
versality of Hχ, but recent research shows equal exponents for the fourth-order structure-function components for
an asymptotic inertial range; these developments are reviewed in the Appendix. Universality of Hχ is equivalent

to the assertion that h∇p · ∇pi scales with

r−3D1111 (r) dr at high Reynolds numbers.

As deﬁned in (1), Ra is a Reynolds number; it is a measure of the ratio of rms acceleration to rms viscous
acceleration; it is composed of statistics of the small scales of turbulence; it can be used as a universal abscissa for
judging the universality of turbulence statistics. Through its relationship (1b) to R∇p, it can be evaluated with
single-wire hot-wire anemometry. Although R∇p is not strictly a Reynolds number, it can also be used as a universal

skewness is neglected, then R∇p and Ra may be approximated on the basis of ﬂow similarity estimates of energy
dissipation rate ε combined with a measured time series of u1 even if the spatial resolution of u1 is not suﬃcient to
calculate ε or skewness. Those approximations of R∇p and Ra are denoted by Rappr
and are given in (2).
It is recommended that R∇p and Ra be used in preference to Rappr

∇p and Rappr
whenever possible.

∇p and Rappr

In Sec. 3, it is shown that data from several experiments have graphed R∇p, Rappr

∇p , and Ra with Rλ on the
abscissa. Those graphs show the nonuniversal behavior of Rλ for a variety of ﬂows as the universal Reynolds number
Ra varies.

Models of the small-scale statistics of turbulence should be expressed in terms of universal attributes instead of
in terms of Rλ. For example, in Table II of Belin et al. [6], the model by Pullin and Saﬀman [22] is in good agreement
with data when judged in terms of power laws between derivative moments, but it is in relatively poor agreement
with data when judged in terms of power laws between normalized derivative moments and Rλ. The latter can be
speciﬁc to the ﬂow geometry.

V. APPENDIX

A number of experiments and DNS have shown diﬀerent scaling exponents for longitudinal versus transverse
velocity diﬀerences [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32]; whereas other experiments suggest equal scaling
exponents [33] [34] [35]. The diﬀering exponents have been linked to observed diﬀerences in scaling exponents
of enstrophy and dissipation [23] [24] [25], diﬀerences which must, according to Nelkin [36], disappear in the high-
Reynolds-number limit. Others [32] [37] observe diﬀering exponents which they attribute to departures from isotropy,
and they suggest that the diﬀerence disappears at very large Reynolds numbers, and they ﬁnd that diﬀerences in
scaling of enstrophy and dissipation are insuﬃcient to account for diﬀerent scaling exponents of longitudinal versus
transverse velocity diﬀerences. Recently, Kerr et al. [38] used DNS of isotropic turbulence at the highest attained
Rλ to show that equality of longitudinal and transverse scaling exponents in fourth-order structure functions requires
a more restrictive deﬁnition of the extent of the inertial range than has previously been used and that Rλ must be
at least 390. Kerr et al [38] then quantitatively explain the previous observations of diﬀerent scaling exponents on
the basis that Rλ was too small or that the range chosen for evaluation of the exponents was too extensive. With
fourth-order scaling exponents returning to equal values at suﬃciently large Rλ, the reasons given by Hill and Wilczak
[15] that Hχ is a constant at very large Rλ are again strong. The empirical evidence by Vedula and Yeung [18] for
the value of Hχ is strong as well.

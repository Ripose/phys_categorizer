Dynamic radiation force of acoustic waves on solid elastic spheres

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The present study concerns the dynamic radiation force on solid elastic spheres exerted by a
plane wave with two frequencies (bichromatic wave) considering the nonlinearity of the ﬂuid. Our
approach is based on solving the wave scattering for the sphere in the quasilinear approximation
within the preshock wave range. The dynamic radiation force is then obtained by integrating
the component of the momentum ﬂux tensor at the diﬀerence of the primary frequencies over the
boundary of the sphere. Results reveal that eﬀects of the nonlinearity of the ﬂuid plays a major role
in dynamic radiation force leading it to a parametric ampliﬁcation regime. The developed theory
is used to calculate the dynamic radiation force on three diﬀerent solid spheres (aluminium, silver,
and tungsten). Resonances are observed in the spectrum of the force on the spheres. They have
larger amplitude and better shape than resonances present in static radiation force.

INTRODUCTION

Among nonlinear eﬀects of acoustic wave propagation
in ﬂuids is worth noticeable radiation pressure (force) [1]
and streaming [2]. These phenomena come together as
an incident wave encounters an obstacle. They are phys-
ically diﬀerent but may combine producing an eﬀective
force upon the obstacle. Usually these phenomena can-
not be separated in actual ﬂuids [3]. When thermovis-
cous eﬀects are negligible, streaming can be ruled out.
With respect to time dependence, radiation force is ei-
ther static or dynamic. Static radiation force is a time
averaged quantity produced on a target by a monochro-
matic acoustic wave. The dynamic counter-part is an
oscillatory force exerted on a target by a bichromatic
acoustic wave. Here we consider that this force oscillates
in time at the diﬀerence frequency of the wave, i.e., the
diﬀerence between the primary wave frequencies.

The utilization of dynamic radiation force in science
and technology has broadened. It has been applied for
measuring ultrasound power of ultrasonic transducers [4],
inducing oscillation in bubbles and liquid drops [5, 6],
and exciting modes in capillary bridges [7]. Dynamic
radiation force has become the underlying principle in
some elastography techniques such as shear wave elas-
ticity imaging [8] and vibro-acoustography [9]. Using vi-
brometry, the viscoelasticity of transparent materials can
be determined by locally measuring the vibration of a em-
bedded sphere induced by dynamic radiation force [10].
In a pioneer work, King [11] calculated the static radi-
ation force exerted on a rigid sphere by a plane traveling
wave in a lossless ﬂuid. Study on the static force of com-
pressible and elastic spheres followed up [12, 13]. It was
promptly noticed that the static radiation force exhibits
ﬂuctuations related to the mechanical properties of the

∗Electronic address: glauber@tci.ufal.br

sphere. Eﬀects of viscosity and thermal conductivity of
the host ﬂuid on the static radiation force over a rigid
sphere were also theoretically accounted [14]. For elastic
solid media, a theoretical formulation of radiation force
problem can be found in Ref. [15].

The inﬂuence of the nonlinearity of the ﬂuid on static
radiation force is negligible at least for lossless ﬂuids
where the nonlinear parameter B/A < 100 [16, 17]. The
dynamic radiation force exerted on a solid sphere by a
plane traveling wave has been theoretically investigated
in Ref. [18]. Experimental validation of the theory is
found in Ref. [19].
In both works, the diﬀerence fre-
quency was assumed to be very narrow. On that account
the magnitude of dynamic and static radiation forces are
alike. Dynamic radiation force exerted on an object is
directly caused by the pressure wave at the diﬀerence fre-
quency acting on the object. It is known that the wave
at the diﬀerence frequency might be subjected to para-
metric ampliﬁcation [20]. This suggests that dynamic ra-
diation force itself should achieve a regime of parametric
ampliﬁcation. Silva et al. [21] veriﬁed that the dynamic
radiation force on an acrylic sphere can be greatly am-
pliﬁed as the diﬀerence frequency is increased.

The aim of this work is to analyze the dynamic radi-
ation force exerted on a solid elastic sphere in the para-
metric regime. This analysis should be carried consid-
ering the nonlinearity of the ﬂuid in the problem. To
the best of the author’s knowledge this problem has not
yet been treated. To accomplish this task we have to
solve the acoustic scattering for the sphere in at least the
quasilinear approximation. In what follows we present,
based on regular perturbation technique, the wave equa-
tions in the quasilinear approximation for lossless ﬂuids.
The solution for a bichromatic plane traveling wave is
derived from these equations within the preshock wave
range. Using the Mie scattering theory we obtain a de-
scription for the scattered waves by the elastic sphere.
The yielded result is used in an vector integral formula
obtained for the dynamic radiation force. We apply the

developed theory to analyze the dynamic radiation force
on three diﬀerent elastic spheres, namely, aluminium, sil-
ver, and tungsten. A connection of dynamic radiation
force and the Resonance Scattering Theory (RST) is es-
tablished. The spectrum of the dynamic radiation force
for the spheres is numerically evaluated. Resonances are
observed in the spectrum of the force. They depend in
a unique manner on the mechanical and elastic parame-
ters of the sphere. Thus, the resonances in the spectrum
could be used for characterization of materials. Further-
more, their magnitude are up to 81 dB higher than those
found in static radiation force.

II. NONLINEAR WAVE PROPAGATION AND
SCATTERING

Consider a homogeneous and isotropic ﬂuid with adi-
abatic speed of sound c0, in which thermal conductivity
and viscosity are neglected. The ﬂuid has inﬁnite extent
and is characterized by the following acoustic ﬁelds: pres-
sure p, density ρ, and particle velocity v = −∇φ. The
function φ is the velocity potential and ∇ is the gradient
operator. These ﬁelds are function of the position vector
r and time t. At rest, these quantities assume constant
values p = p0, ρ = ρ0, and v = 0. The acoustic ﬁelds are
governed by the dynamic equations of ideal ﬂuids. By us-
ing the regular perturbation technique, one can expand
velocity potential in terms of the Mach number ε ≪ 1
as φ = εφ(1) + ε2φ(2) + O(ε3), where the super-indexes
indicate the order of the potential functions. Any analy-
sis of radiation force has to be done considering at least
the quasilinear approximation, i.e., second-order acoustic
ﬁelds.

To obtain the dynamic radiation force over an object,
we have to solve the scattering of a bichromatic wave for
the object. Consider a bichromatic traveling plane wave
of ﬁnite-amplitude with primary frequencies ω1 and ω2
propagating along the z-axis. The wave is formed by a
sinusoidal excitation at z = 0. Due to nonlinear nature
of wave propagation, a third wave at the diﬀerence fre-
quency ω21 = ω2 − ω1 arises in the ﬂuid. Suppose the
bichromatic wave hits a sphere of radius a placed in the
z-axis at the distance z0 from the acoustic source. The
elastic sphere has density ρ1, compressional and shear
speed of sound denoted, respectively, by cc and cs. To
simplify our analysis we consider k21z0 ≫ 1 and a ≪ z0.
Let us denote the complex amplitudes of the potential
functions (incident plus scattered) at the frequencies ω1,
ω2, and ω21 by, respectively, ˆφ1, ˆφ2, and ˆφ21. The total
potential for scattering problem can be found using the
Mie scattering theory. Accordingly, the velocity poten-
tials in terms of spherical waves in the spherical coordi-

nonlinear parameter of the ﬂuid. The functions h(1)

h(2)
n are, respectively, the ﬁrst- and second-kind spherical
Hankel functions of nth-order, while Pn is the Legendre
polynomial of nth-order.

The quantity Sn is the modal scattering function. To
ﬁnd this function we apply the solid elastic-ﬂuid bound-
ary conditions on the sphere surface. These conditions
yield a linear system whose solution is

We restrict our analysis to waves in which ω21 < ω1,

The second integral in the right-hand side of Eq. (5)
depends on the variation of the object boundary caused
by the incident wave. The evaluation of this integral for
a moving object is a hard task because this is a self-
coupled problem. We have to calculate the force on the
object in ﬁrst-order by integrating the linear pressure on
the boundary of the object. However, the pressure may
deform or move the boundary of the object. We shall
show an approximate calculation of this term for a rigid
spherical target.

Consider a rigid sphere of radius a and density ρ1 sus-
pended in a ﬂuid. The origin of the coordinate system
coincide to the center of the sphere at rest. We assume
the sphere oscillates only along the z-axis. The variation
∆z in the ﬁrst-order approximation of the normal vector
of the sphere is given by

n = er − ∆zez + O(ε2ez),

where er is the radial unit vector and ez is the unit vec-
tor along the z direction. We have ∆z = δz1e−iω1t +
δz2e−iω2t, δz1 and δz2 are the amplitudes of oscillation
of the sphere. The second integral of Eq. (5) might be

The quantity xm = ωma/c0 is the size factor of the
sphere. Equations (7) and (8) give us an approxima-
tion to calculate the ﬁrst term of the amplitudes of the
dynamic radiation force in Eq. (5).

The dynamic radiation force is calculated as follows.
With the obtained ﬁrst- and second-order potential ﬁelds
in Eqs. (1) and (2), the ﬁrst term in the right-hand side
of Eq. (5) is calculated performing the surface integral.
The second integral of this equation can be evaluated
using Eqs. (7), (8), and (9). Accordingly, the dynamic
radiation force on the sphere is given by

f21(t) = πa2E0 ˆY21e

where E0 = ε2ρ0c2

The function ˆYa is proportional to the inverse of the
radiation impedance of the sphere at the fundamental fre-
quencies ω1 and ω2. This term is divergent when the size
factors x1 and x2 approach to zero. In the case x1, x2 > 1
we may disregard the contribution of ˆYa to the radiation

force function. Furthermore,
tion of function ˆYb brings up the regime of parametric am-
pliﬁcation in the dynamic radiation force. It has a domi-
nant role whenever the size factor x21 is not a small quan-
tity. It also depends linearly on the nonlinear parame-
ter γ and the ratio z0/a. This function has the follow-
ing asymptotic behavior | ˆYb|
.
The ampliﬁcation of the radiation force with z0 does
(cid:1)
not increase indeﬁnitely. On that account two aspects
should be asserted. The distance z0 should be within the

preshock wave range otherwise Eqs. (1) and (2) are no
longer valid. Diﬀraction and ﬂuid viscosity may alter the
dependence of radiation force with the distance z0 (see
Ref. [24]). The function ˆYc has a prominent contribu-
tion to the dynamic radiation force whenever xmn ≪ 1.
When x21 = 0 the incident wave becomes monochromatic
and the dynamic radiation force in Eq. (10) reduces to
its static counter-part as obtained in Ref. [13].

Hereafter, we focus on the situation of which x21 is
not a very small quantity and x1, x2 > 1. Therefore, the
radiation force function becomes ˆY21 = ˆYb. In that case,
the integral formula of dynamic radiation force in Eq. (5)
is reduced to

where [18].

IV. RESONANCE SCATTERING THEORY AND
DYNAMIC RADIATION FORCE

In our previous analysis, we have found that the dy-
namic radiation force function reduces to ˆY21 = ˆYb. Ac-
cording to the Resonance Scattering Theory (RST), the
response of an elastic sphere to a plane wave excitation
can be decomposed into a modal rigid body background
interfering with resonance contributions [22]. The reso-
nances appear due to the eigenvibration modes of some
types of surface waves (Rayleigh and whispering gallery
waves) present on the sphere as the result of the plane
wave excitation.

To isolate the resonance contributions to the dynamic
radiation force, we follow the approach developed in
Ref. [25]. Accordingly, the resonance scattering function
is given by

S(res)

n =

− 1,

Sn
S(r)
n

(15)

n (x) = h(2)
1

′(x) is the modal scattering
where S(r)
function of a rigid sphere. We thus deﬁne the resonance
radiation force function of an elastic sphere as

′(x)/h(1)
1

21 = x21S(res)
ˆY (res)

1

(x21)h(1)

1 (x21),

(16)

for which we dropped the factor γz0/a because it is not
relevant to resonance analysis. The resonance radiation
force function is proportional to the backscattered wave
(θ = π) of mode n = 1 (the dipole mode). Further-
more, this function carries an unique information of the
sphere in terms of its mechanical parameters, including
the elastic constants of the material.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We evaluate the radiation force function for three dif-
ferent solid spheres, which are made aluminium, silver,
and tungsten. The physical parameters under consid-
eration of these materials are summarized in Table I.
The ﬂuid medium is water whose parameters are ρ0 =
1000 Kg/m3, c0 = 1500 m/s, and γ = 6.

In Fig. 1, we plot the spectrum of the function ¯Y21 =
a(γz0)−1 ˆY21 for the three spheres. This function varies
within the range 0 < x21 < 30 incremented by steps of
0.01. We also consider x1, x2 > 1, therefore, the contri-
butions from ˆYa and ˆYc to the radiation force function are
negligible. The region 0 < x21 < 5 corresponds to the
crossover between the static radiation force (x21 = 0)
and the fully developed dynamic radiation force x21 > 5.
To see how larger is the magnitude of the dynamic radi-
ation force in this region compared to that of the static
counter-part consider z0/a = 1000. The magnitude of
the static radiation force function for all spheres is about
the unit [26], while that for the dynamic radiation force
function in x21 > 5 is around 12000. Therefore, the mag-
nitude of the fully developed dynamic radiation force is
81 dB higher than that of the static radiation force. The
spectrum of dynamic radiation force function follows the
behavior of the radiation force function for a rigid sphere
in which cc, cs, ρ1 → +∞, except for the the appearance
of well deﬁned resonances. The labels Al-n, Ag-n, and
W-n indicate the nth resonance in the radiation force
function for, respectively, the aluminium, the silver, and
the tungsten spheres. Only the ﬁrst three resonances are
highlighted in the graphs.

The spectrum of the resonance radiation force func-
tion for the aluminium sphere is plotted in Fig. 2.a. We
plot the phase of the corresponding resonance scattering
function in Fig. 2.b. Whenever the spectrum undergoes
through a resonance or an antiresonance (destructive in-
terference of two adjacent peaks [27]) the phase shifts by
π. The almost constant behavior of the phase near to
the ﬁrst peak reveals that the peak is not related to a
resonance of the sphere.

In Fig. 3.a, we have the spectrum of the resonance
radiation force function for the silver sphere. The phase
of the resonance scattering function is shown in Fig. 3.b.
We have a similar behavior of the spectrum as observed
for the aluminium sphere.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have carried out a theoretical analysis of dynamic
radiation force caused by bichromatic waves on a target
taking into account the nonlinearty of the ﬂuid medium.
In the analysis, the object target must be within the
preshock wave range. To obtain the force exerted on an
solid elastic sphere we had to solve the scattering problem

in the quasilinear approximation using the partial wave
expansions given in Eqs. (1) and (2). The incident and
scattered ﬁelds were used in Eq. (5) yielding the radia-
tion force. It was demonstrated that dynamic radiation
force is caused by parametric ampliﬁcation of the diﬀer-
ence frequency wave. This is experimentally supported
by Ref. [21]. Further, the force is proportional to the non-
linear parameter of the ﬂuid γ. We therefore presented
a much simpler formula for dynamic radiation force in
Eq. (14).

The obtained result of the dynamic radiation function
in Eq. (12) permitted a straight connection with this
force and the Resonance Scattering Theory (RST). To
the best of the author’s knowledge such connection has
not yet been explored before, neither theoretically nor

experimentally. The spectrum of the dynamic radiation
force as a function x21 exhibited well deﬁned resonances,
which have larger amplitude (about 81 dB higher) and
are better shaped than those present in static radiation
force [26]. The resonances are caused by eigenvibrations
in some surface waves on the sphere at the diﬀerence
frequency ω21. The RST allowed us to separate the res-
onance part of the radiation force function as given in
Eq. (16). We, thus, analyze the resonance spectrum for
three diﬀerent spheres made of aluminium, silver, and
tungsten. Furthermore, the study of dynamic radiation
force on spherical shells can be readily done by using the
present theory. The location, amplitude, and width of
these resonances depend upon the mechanical and the
elastic properties of the sphere. Hence, the spectrum
information could be used as the material signature in
a noncontact acoustic spectroscopy technique.
In this
method, the induced vibration by the dynamic radiation
force on a specimen could be measured by a laser vi-
brometer yielding the spectrum of the force [19]. From
the spectrum it is possible to extract the elastic proper-
ties of the specimen in a similar manner as done in the

6

Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy [28].

We have not considered thermoviscous eﬀects in the
ﬂuid. By neglecting such eﬀects we ruled out acoustic
streaming in the boundary of the sphere. Usually stream-
ing has the tendency of altering the total eﬀective force
acting on a target. Moreover, the dependency of dynamic
radiation force with temperature was not accomplished
here. Variations in the temperature may change the lo-
cation and width of the resonances in the spectrum of
the dynamic radiation force.

In conclusion, this paper presented a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of the dynamic radiation force on
solid spheres. The spectrum of this force carries use-
ful information of the sphere related to its elastic and
mechanical properties.

Suppressing the Rayleigh-Taylor instability with a rotating magnetic ﬁeld

Dirk Rannacher∗ and Andreas Engel

(Dated: July 23, 2013)

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability of a magnetic ﬂuid superimposed on a non-magnetic liquid of
lower density may be suppressed with the help of a spatially homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld rotating in
the plane of the undisturbed interface. Starting from the complete set of Navier-Stokes equations for
both liquids a Floquet analysis is performed which consistently takes into account the viscosities of
the ﬂuids. Using experimentally relevant values of the parameters we suggest to use this stabilization
mechanism to provide controlled initial conditions for an experimental investigation of the Rayleigh-
Taylor instability.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability [1], [2], [3] is a classi-
cal hydrodynamic instability [4] with relevance in such
diverse ﬁelds as plasma physics, astrophysics, meteorol-
ogy, geophysics, inertial conﬁnement fusion and granular
media, for a review see, e.g., [5]. Generically this insta-
bility develops if a layer of liquid is superimposed to an
immiscible and less dense liquid such that the potential
energy of the system can be reduced by interchanging
the liquids. Consequently, the initially plane interface
between the liquids becomes unstable and the charac-
teristic dimples and spikes develop resulting ﬁnally in a
stable layering with the lighter ﬂuid on top of the heavier
one.

investigation of

A quantitative experimental

the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability requires reliable control of the
initial condition. Standard procedures like suddenly re-
moved partitions between the ﬂuids [6], [7] or quickly
turning the experimental cell upside down [8], [9] clearly
produce unpredictable initial perturbations. It is much
more convenient to use some additional mechanism which
ﬁrst stabilizes the unstable layering of the liquids and may
later be switched oﬀ instantaneously.
It is well known
that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability may be suppressed,
e.g., by vertical oscillation of the system [10], [11] and by
appropriate temperature gradients [12]. The ﬁrst mech-
anism is likely to induce uncontrolled initial surface de-
ﬂections when stopped, in the second one it is diﬃcult to
abruptly switch oﬀ the stabilization.

In the present paper we investigate the possibility to
stabilize a potentially Rayleigh-Taylor unstable system
involving a magnetic ﬂuid by external magnetic ﬁelds.
We will show that for experimentally relevant parame-
ter values moderate ﬁelds strengths which can easily be
switched on and oﬀ are suﬃcient to achieve the desired
stabilization.

Magnetic ﬂuids are suspensions of ferromagnetic nano-
particles in carrier liquids with the hydrodynamic prop-

∗rannacher@theorie.physik.uni-oldenburg.de

erties of Newtonian ﬂuids and the magnetic properties
of super-paramagnets [13], [14]. It is well known that a
magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the plane interface between a
ferroﬂuid and a non-magnetic ﬂuid suppresses interface
deﬂections with wave vector in the direction of the ﬁeld
[13]. This may be used to stabilize the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability in two-dimensional situations where the inter-
face is line, as e. g. in a Hele-Shaw cell. In the more nat-
ural three-dimensional setting we are interested in here a
static magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the undisturbed interface
is not suﬃcient to stabilize the ﬂat interface since pertur-
bation with wave vectors perpendicular to the magnetic
ﬁeld will still grow as in the absence of the ﬁeld. We
therefore propose to use a spatially homogeneous mag-
netic ﬁeld rotating in the plane of the undisturbed inter-
face and determine appropriate values of the ﬁeld am-
plitude and rotation frequency. An alternative possibil-
ity is to use a static inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld with
the magnetic force counterbalancing gravity [17]. This
method was used in [16] to investigate the 2-d Rayleigh-
Taylor instability in a Hele-Shaw cell.

Before embarking upon the detailed analysis we would
like to mention three characteristic features of our
method. Firstly, we will show that a rotating magnetic
ﬁeld is unable to suppress all possible unstable modes of
the system. In fact it can only stabilize surface deﬂec-
tions with wavenumber modulus larger than some thresh-
old value. Perturbations with very long wavelength are,
however, not a serious problem in real experiments be-
cause these are suppressed automatically by the ﬁnite ge-
ometry of the sample. Secondly, it is well-known that in
analogy with the Faraday instability an oscillating mag-
netic ﬁeld will induce new instabilities at wave numbers
which without ﬁeld were stable [20], [21]. In our analy-
sis we keep track of these unstable modes and determine
the magnetic ﬁeld strength such that no new instabilities
may occur. For suppressing these new modes viscous
losses in the liquids will be decisive which is the reason
why the viscosities of the two liquids will be consistently
taken into account in the analysis. Finally, due to the
dispersed magnetic grains ferroﬂuids have usually com-
paratively high densities. We therefore specialize to the
case in which the upper, heavier layer is formed by the

2

magnetic ﬂuid. This should be the typical situation in
experiments. Nevertheless a similar analysis with analo-
gous results is possible for the reverse situation with the
ferroﬂuid at the bottom of the system superimposed by
an even denser non-magnetic liquid.

The paper is organized as follows. In section II we col-
lect the basic equations and boundary conditions. In Sec-
tion III we linearize these equations around the reference
state of a plane interface between the liquids. Section IV
contains the Floquet theory to determine the boundaries
separating stable from unstable regions in the parameter
plane. After shortly discussing two approximate treat-
ments of the ﬂuid viscosities in section V we present the
results of our analysis in section VI. Finally section VII
contains some discussion.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

We consider a ferroﬂuid with density ρ(2) superimposed
on a non-magnetic ﬂuid of lower density ρ(1) < ρ(2), see
Fig. 1. Both layers are assumed to be inﬁnite in hori-
zontal as well as in vertical direction. The densities and
the respective viscosities η(1) and η(2) are taken to be
constant. The liquids are immiscible and the interface
between them is parametrized by z = ζ(x, y, t). We will
study the stability of a ﬂat interface which we take as
the x-y-plane of our coordinate system, the undisturbed
interface is hence given by ζ(x, y, t) ≡ 0. In the absence
of a magnetic ﬁeld this situation is unstable due to the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability [1, 2, 4].

In the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld H the
magnetic ﬂuid builds up a magnetization M which is as-
sumed to be a linear function of the ﬁeld, M = χH,
where χ denotes the susceptibility related to the relative
permeability by µr = 1 + χ. Both liquids are subject
to the homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld acting in negative
z-direction and to the interface tension σ acting at their
common interface. The magnetic ﬂuid is additionally in-
ﬂuenced by the magnetic force density (M∇)H result-
ing from the externally imposed spatially homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld H0 = H0(cos(Ωt), sin(Ωt), 0) rotating with
constant angular frequency Ω in the x-y-plane.

The time evolution of the system is governed by the
following set of equations. The incompressibility of both
liquids gives rise to the continuity equations for the ve-
locity ﬁelds v(j)

∇ · v(j) = 0 ,

with j = 1, 2 where here and in the following the lower
(i.e. non-magnetic) ﬂuid parameters are denoted with
superscript (1) and the higher (magnetic) one with su-
perscript (2). The hydrodynamic equations of motion are
the Navier-Stokes equations

interface ζ(x, y, t) points into the non-magnetic liquid. The
vector g denotes the gravitational acceleration, σ is the inter-
face tension. The system is subjected to a horizontal rotating
magnetic ﬁeld H0 = H0(cos(Ωt), sin(Ωt), 0) with angular fre-
quency Ω.

Here p(j) denotes the pressure in each liquid, and B(j) =
µ0(H(j) + M(j)) is the respective magnetic induction.
Note that also the stress tensor for the non-magnetic liq-
uid contains contributions from the magnetic ﬁeld which,
however, are divergence free and therefore do not give rise
to a force density in the lower ﬂuid.

For values of Ω relevant to the present investigation
radiative eﬀects are negligible and the magnetic ﬁeld has
to obey the magneto-static Maxwell equations

∇ · B(j) = 0

∇ × H(j) = 0

.

In view of the second equation it is convenient to intro-
duce scalar magnetic potentials Φ(j) according to H(j) =
−∇Φ(j). These potentials then fulﬁll the Laplace equa-
tions

∇2Φ(j) = 0 .

(1)

The above equation have to be supplemented by appro-
priate boundary conditions. Far from the interface the
velocities must remain bounded,

and the magnetic ﬁeld must be equal to the externally
imposed ﬁeld,

The tangential components of the stress tensor have to
be continuous,

interface is related to the velocity ﬁelds in the liquids by

III. LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS

The main purpose of the present work is to investi-
gate whether the Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be sup-
pressed with the help of a rotating magnetic ﬁeld. We
will hence study the linear stability of the reference state
with a ﬂat interface, ζ(x, y, t) ≡ 0, in dependence on the
magnetic ﬁeld strength H0 and the angular frequency Ω.
The reference solution of the basic equations is given by

and

v(j)
0 = 0,

p(j)
0 = −ρ(j)gz,

Φ0 = −H0 (cos(Ωt)x + sin(Ωt)y)

.

(13)

To investigate its stability we introduce as usual small
perturbations

v(j) = v(j)

0 + δv(j),

p(j) = p(j)

0 + δp(j),

,

(14)

Φ(j) = Φ0 + φ(j)

and linearize the basic equations in these perturbations
as well as in the interface deﬂection ζ(x, y, t). We will
denote the components of the perturbed velocity vectors

implying

The boundary conditions at the interface simplify under
linearization. Generally we may replace the interface po-
sition z = ζ(x, y, t) by z = 0 to linear order in ζ(x, y, t).
Therefore the symbol △ has now the more speciﬁc mean-
ing △ λ = limz↓0 λ(z) − limz↑0 λ(z). From (11) we then

problem. An appropriate ansatz is therefore given by

We now invoke Floquet theory [18, 19] to solve this sys-
tem of linear diﬀerential equations with time periodic
boundary conditions for the amplitudes ˆw(j)(z, t) and
ˆζ(t).

IV. FLOQUET THEORY

In order to analyze the stability of the ﬂat interface we
employ the following Floquet ansatz for the time depen-
dence of the interface perturbation amplitude ˆζ and the
z-components of the velocity ˆw(j):

ˆζ(t), ˆw(j)(z, t)

= e(α+iβ) Ωt

(41)
where α + iβ is the Floquet exponent. Here α is a real
number and negative α describes stable situation whereas
positive α signals an instability of the reference state.
The imaginary part β of the Floquet exponent is either
zero or one and distinguishes between harmonic (β = 0)
and subharmonic (β = 1) response of the system [18].
Plugging (41) into (32) we ﬁnd

Since this equation has to hold for all values of t all coeﬃcients in the curly brackets must vanish separately. We
therefore end up with an inﬁnite homogeneous system of linear equations for the amplitudes ˜ζn in which the oﬀ-
diagonal terms arise due to the time dependence in (40). Nontrivial solutions for the ˜ζn require that the determinant
of the coeﬃcient matrix vanishes which yields the desired relation between the parameters of the problem, H0, k
and α. In the present investigation we are mainly interested in the stability boundaries in the parameter plane. We
therefore specialize to the case α = 0 and ﬁnd for the coeﬃcients Wn in (47)

To exploit the solvability condition for a numerical de-
termination of the stability boundaries we have to trun-
cate the inﬁnite system of linear equations at some ﬁ-
nite value nmax of n. Comparing the results for diﬀerent
values of nmax the accuracy of the procedure may be
estimated. For the results presented in section VI we
have used nmax = 19, i.e. we have included 39 terms,
−19 ≤ n ≤ 19.

V. SPECIAL CASES

Before presenting explicit results of our analysis for ex-
perimentally relevant parameter values it is instructive
to consider two limiting cases for which alternative ap-
proaches are available. Let us ﬁrst discuss the situation
of ideal liquids, η(1) = η(2) = 0. Using (32), (36) and
(37) we may then express ˆw(j) in terms of ˆζ. Plugging
the result into the boundary condition (40) we obtain
the following Mathieu equation for the amplitude of the

From the standard stability chart of the Mathieu equa-
tion [22] we are now able to determine the threshold for
the amplitude H0 of the external ﬁeld necessary to sta-
bilize interface deﬂections with wavenumber modulus k.
However, since most ferroﬂuids are rather viscous this
theory will not adequately describe the experimental sit-
uation.

It is possible to approximately incorporate the inﬂu-
ence of viscosity by assuming that the dominant contribu-
tion to viscous damping originates far from the interface
in the bulk of the ﬂuids where the ﬂow ﬁeld is identical
to the one of ideal liquids [23, 24]. One may then derive
a damped Mathieu equation for the amplitudes of the
interface deﬂection of the form

where the damping constant γ is given by

Since the damped Mathieu equation may be mapped on
the undamped one [22] we may again employ the stability
chart of the Mathieu equation to discuss the stabilization
of a surface deﬂection mode with wave vector modulus k
in the presence of small damping. In the following section
we compare the results of these approximate estimates
with those of our complete treatment.

VI. RESULTS

In this section we display detailed results of our analy-
sis for a typical experimental combination of a ferroﬂuid
and an immiscible non-magnetic ﬂuid which has been
used in a related experimental investigation [15]. The
ﬂuid parameters are as follows: ρ(2) = 1690 kg m−3,
η(2) = 0.14 Pa s, χ = 2.6, ρ(1) = 800 kg m−3, η(1) =
0.005 Pa s, and σ = 0.012 N m−1. For the capillary length
λc = 2π/kc,H=0 we then obtain λc ≃ 7 mm. The dimen-
sionless magnetic ﬁeld amplitude H0 = 1 corresponds to
a ﬁeld of H0 = 3.3 kA/m, Ω = 1 corresponds to a ﬁeld
rotating with frequency f = 14.6 Hz.

In Figs. 2 and 3 we show the regions of instability of the
ﬂat interface in the k-H0 plane. For H0 = 0 all pertur-
bations are unstable for which the modulus of the wave
vector is smaller than 1 (in our dimensionless units, cf.

for the ﬂat interface between a ferroﬂuid and a non-magnetic
ﬂuid in a rotating magnetic ﬁeld. The dimensionless angular
frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld is Ω = 0.69 corresponding to
f = 10 Hz, the remaining parameters are as given in the main
text. The full lines separating the white regions of stability
from the gray regions of unstable combinations derive from
a numerical solution of (47). For comparison also the results
of the inviscid theory building on (49) and of the approxi-
mate treatment of viscosity related to (50) are included as
long and short dashed lines respectively. The threshold val-
ues of the magnetic ﬁeld and wave number are Hth = 2.2 and
kth = 0.2 corresponding in physical units to Hth ≃ 7.3 kAm−1
and λth ≃ 3.7 cm.

(15)), which is the well-known trademark of the Rayleigh-
Taylor instability. Increasing H0 from zero the interval of
unstable wave numbers shrinks and hence more and more
long-wave perturbations may be stabilized. However, if
H0 gets larger than a threshold value Hth the parametric
excitation due to the time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld gives
rise to new instabilities at higher wave-numbers. Since
these additional unstable modes are clearly unwanted
H0 must remain below this threshold value Hth. Cor-
respondingly there is a threshold kth for the wavenumber
modulus such that perturbations with k < kth cannot be
stabilized with the help of the magnetic ﬁeld. As we will

detail in section VII these modes have to be stabilized by
lateral boundary conditions. We note that with decreas-
ing Ω the tongues of instability move closer together and
come nearer to the k-axis implying Hth → 0 and kth → 1
for Ω → 0.

It is clearly seen from the ﬁgures that the stability
regions are strongly inﬂuenced by the viscosity of the
liquids. In the inviscid theory the tongues of instability
all reach the k-axis implying that any rotating magnetic
ﬁeld would induce new unstable modes at values of k
that were stable in the absence of the ﬁeld. Therefore a
complete suppression of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
would be impossible. It is also apparent that for realistic
parameter combinations the phenomenological inclusion
of viscosity in the theoretical description as discussed in
the previous section may give results which signiﬁcantly
diﬀer from the complete theory. This is similar to the
analysis of the Faraday instability performed in [19].

Figs. 4 and 5 display the dependence of the threshold
values Hth and kth on the angular frequency Ω of the
ﬁeld. Clearly Hth increases and kth decreases with in-
creasing Ω as exempliﬁed also by a comparison between
Fig. 2 and 3. For the parameters considered an increase
in Ω beyond Ω = 2 does not signiﬁcantly reduce kth any
more.

Finally, Fig. 6 combines Figs. 4 and 5 and shows the

VII. DISCUSSION

In the present paper we have investigated the possi-
bility to stabilize a layering of a ferroﬂuid and a non-
magnetic ﬂuid which were potentially unstable due to
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability by a spatially homoge-
neous magnetic ﬁeld rotating in the plane of the undis-
turbed interface. Special emphasis was put on an exact
treatment of the inﬂuence of the viscosities by starting
from the complete set of Navier-Stokes equations for both

FIG. 5: Similarly to Fig. 4 the threshold value kth of the
wavenumber modulus k is shown as function of the angular
frequency Ω of the ﬁeld.

liquids. Our results show that this approach is for exper-
imentally relevant parameter values superior to both the
inviscid theory and to a standard phenomenological pro-
cedure to include viscous eﬀects using the inviscid ﬂow
ﬁeld.

The trademark of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is a
band of unstable wave numbers extending from k = 0
up to a threshold value kth which in the absence of
magnetic eﬀects is given by the capillary wavelength
kc =
△ρg/σ. The main result of the present inves-
tigation is that kth may be reduced roughly by a factor
of ten with the help of a rotating magnetic ﬁeld of ex-
perimentally easily accessible amplitude and frequency.
As expected the stabilization works best for ferroﬂuids
with high susceptibility χ which, however, have also high
densities increasing in turn kc.

p

In order to provide a clean initial condition for an ex-
perimental study of the onset of the Rayleigh-Taylor in-
stability one has also to stabilize the modes with k ≤ kth.
One way to accomplish this suppression may be to use
the boundary condition of a ﬁnite geometry, i.e. by pin-
ning the contact line between the liquids at the boundary
of the sample. In this way all long wave-number modes
with k < kbc are stabilized. Here kbc is determined by
the linear extension L of the sample and roughly given

8

by kbc ≃ π/L. Modes with k > kc,H=0 are suppressed
by surface tension. If one is able to temporarily stabilize
the remaining modes by the rotating magnetic ﬁeld, i.e.
if one is able to realize kth < kbc the ﬂat interface is sta-
ble. Switching oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld at a given time all
modes with kbc < k < 1 will become unstable. Since it is
easily possible to realize values of kth signiﬁcantly smaller
than kmax, the wavenumber with largest growth rate in
the absence of the ﬁeld, the ensuing Rayleigh-Taylor in-
stability should closely resemble the case without lateral
boundary conditions. To be precise it should be empha-
sized that our theoretical analysis is for inﬁnite layers
only and does not take into account the inﬂuence of lat-
eral boundary conditions. However, the relevant values
of Hth and kth will only marginally be modiﬁed.

For an order of magnitude estimate let us consider a
cylindrical vessel of diameter d = 5 cm. Pinning the con-
tact line at the boundary the instability of modes with

dimensionless wavenumber k < kbc ≃ 0.11 will be sup-
pressed. On the other hand a rotating magnetic ﬁeld with
amplitude H0 ≃ 10 kAm−1 and frequency f = 20 Hz re-
alizes kth ≃ 0.1 (cf. Fig. 3). Switching oﬀ the magnetic
ﬁeld all modes with kbc < k < 1 will become unstable.
For the above example this includes the ﬁrst 8 cylindrical
modes which should allow a rather accurate study of the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We hope that our theoreti-
cal study may stimulate experimental work along these
lines.

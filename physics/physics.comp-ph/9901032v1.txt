Abstract

It is rigorously shown that the ﬂuctuation formula, which is used in simulations

to calculate the dielectric constant of interaction site models, corresponds to the

reaction ﬁeld with an individual site cut-oﬀ rather than with the usual molecular

center of mass truncation. Within the molecular cut-oﬀ scheme, a modiﬁed reaction

ﬁeld is proposed. An inﬂuence of the truncation eﬀects is discussed and examined

by actual Monte Carlo simulations for a MCY water model.

1 Introduction

The calculation of dielectric quantities by computer experiment requires an explicit

consideration of eﬀects associated with the truncation of long-range interactions. The

concrete success in this direction has been achieved within the reaction ﬁeld (RF) geometry

[1–5]. As a result, computer adapted dielectric theories have been proposed [6–10]. In the

framework of these theories, a bulk dielectric constant can be determined on the basis of

a ﬂuctuation formula via correlations obtained in simulations for ﬁnite samples. However,

main attention in the previous investigations has been focused on polar systems with the

point dipole interaction. As is now well established, the model of point dipoles can not

reproduce adequately features of real polar liquids.

At the same time, attempts to apply the RF geometry for more realistic interaction

site (IS) models have also been made [11–13]. However, acting within a semiphenomeno-

logical approach, it was not understood how to perform the truncation of intermolecular

potentials. As a consequence, the molecular cut-oﬀ and the usual point dipole RF (PDRF)

have been assumed. Obviously, such an approach includes eﬀects connected with ﬁniteness

of the molecule inconsistently. Indeed, the interdipolar potential is replaced by site-site

Coulomb interactions, whereas the RF is remained in its usual form. An additional com-

plication for IS models consists in a spatial distribution of charges and this fact is not

taken into account by the standard PDRF geometry.

In the present paper we propose two alternative approaches to remedy this situation.

The ﬁrst one follows from the usual ﬂuctuation formula which is constructed, however,

on the microscopic operator of polarization density for IS models. This leads to an ISRF

geometry, where the cut-oﬀ radius is applied with respect to individual charges rather

than to the molecule as a whole. Nevertheless, the molecular cut-oﬀ scheme can also

be acceptable, but the reaction ﬁeld together with the ﬂuctuation formula need to be

corrected. In the second approach a molecular RF (MRF) geometry is proposed and a

new quadrupole term is identiﬁed. On the basis of a MCY water model we show that

uncertainties of the dielectric quantities can be signiﬁcant if the standard PDRF geometry

is used in computer simulations.

In simulations, which deal with ﬁnite samples, the sum (1) can not be calculated

exactly taking into account an inﬁnitely large number of terms. Therefore, we must

restrict ourselves to a ﬁnite set of terms in (1) or to a ﬁnite range of the integration in (1)

and (2) for which

converge as R−1 for the pure SC scheme, while as R−2 in the RF geometry, i.e., more

quickly, because a main part of the truncation eﬀects is taken into account by the RF. This

is very important in our case, where we hope to reproduce features of inﬁnite systems on

the basis of ﬁnite samples. That is why the pure truncation, which is standard for simple

ﬂuids with short-range potentials, is generally not recommended for polar systems with

long-range nature of the dipolar interaction. The inﬂuence of the TBC and the diﬀerence

between micro- and canonical ensembles are of order N −1

R−3 [14] and, therefore,

∼

they can be excluded from our consideration. It is worth mentioning that electrostatic

ﬁelds are pure longitudinal. They can be deﬁned via the longitudinal component of the

microscopic operator of polarization density, that is conﬁrmed by Eq. (6).

As was mentioned earlier, the electric ﬁeld ˆE

R in the form (3), (4) as well as the

ﬂuctuation formula (7) have been proposed for the ﬁrst time to investigate polar systems

of point dipoles [8]. However, acting within a semiphenomenological framework, it was not

understood how to perform the truncation of the intermolecular potential ϕij at attempts

to extend this formula for IS models. As a result, the molecular cut-oﬀ rij =

It is essentially to emphasize that the ﬂuctuation formula (7) takes into account ﬁnite-

ness of the system explicitly by the factor j1(kR)/(kR). As a result, if the system size is
suﬃciently large (terms of order R−2 can be neglected), the bulk (N, V
) dielectric

→ ∞

constant can be reproduced via the ﬁnite-system Kirkwood factor GL(k) which depends

5

on R in a characteristic way. However, to achieve this self-consistency in the evaluation

of the bulk dielectric constant, the equilibrium averaging in GL(k) must be calculated for
systems with the intermolecular potential which leads exactly to the microscopic electric
ﬁeld ˆE

R (r) (3). As we shall below, the intermolecular potential (8) does not obey this

condition.

at which the ﬂuctuation formula (7) is derived. Therefore, this potential, instead of (8),

must be used in simulations to obtain a correct value for the dielectric constant.

for the interdipolar interaction in the RF geometry. It is easy to see that in the case of IS

models, the intermolecular potential (8) takes into account eﬀects associated with ﬁnite-

ness of the molecule inconsistently. For example, the interdipolar potential is replaced by

the real site-site Coulomb ones, whereas the reaction ﬁeld is remained in its usual form

of point dipoles. From this point of view a natural question of how to improve the RF

within the molecular cut-oﬀ scheme arises. The simplest way to solve this problem lies in

the following.

Let us consider the mentioned above spherical cavity, centered now at some ﬁxed point

r0, in the inﬁnite conducting medium. We place an ith molecule in such a way that all
sites of the molecule would be located in the cavity. This condition is fulﬁlled providing

ﬁnite systems is inhomogeneous even for point dipoles. Only for macroscopic (R

→ ∞
systems, we reproduce the well-known homogeneous reaction ﬁeld M (R)/R3 introduced

)

by Barker and Watts [3]. For ﬁnite IS systems, additional higher multipole terms appear.

This brings, for example, into existence of the new quadrupole-dipole and quadrupole-

quadrupole interactions in the intermolecular potential (16). We note that the idea of

using the higher multipole moments in the RF has been proposed for the ﬁrst time by

Friedman [5].

However, the modiﬁed intermolecular potential (16) still needs to be complemented

by a self-consistent ﬂuctuation formula as this has already been done in the preceding

section by the ﬂuctuation formula (7) for the potential of interaction in the site-site cut-

oﬀ scheme (11). Unfortunately, it is not a simple matter to construct ﬂuctuation formulas

in the molecular cut-oﬀ approach. This problem will be considered in further studying.

The diﬀerence in the RF geometry between IS and PD models lies in the distinction

for their microscopic operators of polarization density. For IS models

is varied in (16) from of order (d/R)2 at rij = 0 to d/R at rij = Rd. Therefore, as far

as the usual intermolecular potential (8) is applied in simulations, the dielectric constant

d/R. It is evident that using

the modiﬁed intermolecular potential (16) will lead to the uncertainties of order (d/R)2.

They decrease at increasing the size of the sample as R−2, i.e., with the same rate as those

connected with the truncation of the potential. Eﬀects of the octupole and higher order

multipole contributions into the MRF are of order (d/R)3 and can be ignored.

4 Applying the ISRF to a MCY water model

In the previous investigations [11–13], the standard PDRF geometry (8) has been

applied to actual simulations of the MCY and TIP4P models. As a result, the static,

frequency-dependent [11, 12] and wavevector-dependent [13] dielectric constant has been

determined. For these models d = 1.837˚A and the cut-oﬀ radius R = 9.856˚A has been

used in the simulations. From the afore said in the preceding section, it is expected that

the precision of these calculations can not exceed d/R

20%. We shall show now by

As an example we apply the ISRF geometry (11) to the MCY potential [16]. The

calculations have been performed with the help of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, details

of which are similar to those reported earlier [13], at the density of ρ= 1.0 g/cm3 and at the

temperature of T = 292 K, i.e., in the same thermodynamic point and yet with the same

number N = 256 of molecules and cut-oﬀ radius R = 9.856˚A as considered in [11, 13].

Our result of the calculation (7) for the longitudinal components of the wavevector-

dependent inﬁnite-system Kirkwood factor gL(k) and dielectric constant εL(k) obtained
within the ISRF geometry is presented in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, as the full circles

connected by the solid curves. For the purpose of comparison, analogous calculations

performed previously [13] within the PDRF are also included in these ﬁgures (the open

circles connected by the dashed curves). It is obvious that oscillations observing in the

shape of gL(k) and εL(k) obtained within the PDRF method are nonphysical and caused
by the ﬁnite molecular size which is assumed to be zero in this approach. At the same

10

time, the ISRF geometry gives the true, more smooth dependencies for the Kirkwood

factor and dielectric constant because the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite molecular size is included

here explicitly. As we can see from the ﬁgures, deviations of values for the wavevector-

dependent dielectric quantities obtained using the PDRF from those evaluated within

the ISRF geometry are signiﬁcant. These deviations achieve maximal values about 25%

near k = 3˚A

−1

values (k > 6˚A

, where the Kirkwood factor has the ﬁrst maximum. For great wavevector
−1

) the both geometries lead to identical results because the inﬂuence of

boundary conditions is negligible in this range of k.

We remark that the wavevector-dependent quantities were calculated directly for the
−1

discrete set k = nkmin of grid points accessible in the simulations, where kmin = 0.319˚A

and n is an integer number. These quantities are marked in the ﬁgures by the symbols.

To obtain intermediate values between the grid points we have used the cubic spline inter-

polation for the most smooth dependency, namely, for gL(k). Then values of εL(k) can be
evaluated anywhere in the considered domain of k-space on the basis of the interpolation

values of gL(k) via Eq. 7. In particular, the ﬁrst singularity of εL(k) (see Fig. 2a) has
been investigated in such a way.

5 Conclusion

Two alternative methods (ISRF and MRF) to overcome the diﬃculties associated with

ﬁniteness of the molecule with respect to the system size have been proposed for IS mod-

els of polar systems. It has been shown rigorously that the ﬂuctuation formula, which

is commonly used for the calculation of the dielectric constant in computer experiment,

corresponds to the ISRF geometry with the site-site cut-oﬀ for Coulomb interaction po-

tentials. The molecular cut-oﬀ scheme leads to the MRF geometry with an additional

quadrupole term to the well-known PDRF.

It has been corroborated by actual calculations that the ISRF geometry exhibits to be

much more eﬃcient with respect to the usual PDRF method for the investigation of the

dielectric properties of IS models. The modiﬁed MRF approach seem to be comparable

in eﬃciency with the ISRF geometry. An application of the MRF to practical simulations

we hope to perform in further studying.

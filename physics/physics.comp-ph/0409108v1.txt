ROPELENGTH OF TIGHT POLYGONAL KNOTS

JUSTYNA BARANSKA, PIOTR PIERANSKI AND ERIC J. RAWDON

Abstract. A physical interpretation of the rope simulated by the
SONO algorithm is presented. Properties of the tight polygonal
knots delivered by the algorithm are analyzed. An algorithm for
bounding the ropelength of a smooth inscribed knot is shown. Two
ways of calculating the ropelength of tight polygonal knots are
compared. An analytical calculation performed for a model knot
shows that an appropriately weighted average should provide a
good estimation of the minimum ropelength for relatively small
numbers of edges.

1. Introduction

Knots tied on material objects, e.g. a rope of a ﬁnite thickness, are
called physical knots [18].
It is well known from everyday life that
open knots can be tightened by pulling apart the loose ends of the
rope. Tightening a closed knot, i.e. a knot tied on a rope whose
ends are spliced, is more diﬃcult since one has to engage processes
in which the rope will reduce its length while keeping its diameter
intact. Such a process, diﬃcult to create in the laboratory, can be easily
simulated numerically and we ﬁnd in the literature various examples
of such simulations [20, 2, 14, 12, 17, 19, 4]. From the intuitive point
of view, it is rather obvious that in tightening a knot tied on a rope
of a ﬁnite diameter, one must arrive at a conformation at which the
tightening process stops. This conformation is called tight. Any small
change in the shape of a tight conformation needs an elongation of the
rope. Obviously, tight conformations of knots tied on diﬀerent types
of rope, with diﬀerent physical properties, will be diﬀerent. Thus, to
make the notion of the tight knot unambiguous, one must specify the
physical model of the rope on which the knot is tied. The simplest of
such models is the perfect rope. Perfect rope is perfectly ﬂoppy – needs
no force to be bent, but, at the same time, it is perfectly hard – needs
an inﬁnite force to be squeezed, its diameter always remains intact. It
is also perfectly slippery. Its formal deﬁnition will be given in the next
section.

Tight conformations can be seen as minimizers of the ropelength
function [1, 11]. The minima can be only local. While it has been
shown that global minima exist [3, 7], with the exception of the triv-
ial knot and some simple links, the minimizing conformations are not
known. Knots in the conformations at which the ropelength reaches
its global minimum are called ideal. As long as the ideal conformations
are not known analytically, we cannot be certain that the conformation
at which one arrives is ideal.

In all simulations of the processes in which knots are tightened, the
knots are represented by a ﬁnite sequence of points in R3 space. When
connected, the points can be seen as vertices of a self-avoiding polygon.
Most often the simulation programs either start from a non-equilateral
conformation and aim at making it equilateral (e.g. SONO) or start
from an equilateral conformation and try to keep it such (crankshaft
rotations). Let P be such an equilateral polygon. The essential prob-
lem we face is to construct, using the coordinates of the vertices of
P , a smooth knot KP which can be seen as the axis of the knot tied
on the perfect rope. In constructing KP , we make some assumptions
concerning the shape of the pieces of which it is built. In what follows
we assume that the knot KP is built from smoothly connected arcs in-
scribed into P , which makes the knot C 1,1 smooth. As a result of this
assumption and provided the radius of the rope is properly chosen, we
show that the knot KP can indeed be tied with perfect rope leaving it
self-avoiding. On the other hand, we also know that the inscribed knot
is not ideal, thus, its ropelength can serve only as an upper bound for
the minimum ropelength of the unknown ideal conformation. In ﬁnd-
ing tight polygonal knots P with an increasing number of vertices, we
see that the ropelength of the inscribed smooth knots KP converges to
a value, which we believe is the ropelength of the ideal conformation,
although we will not prove that here. This convergence is slow however,
and one might want an approximation using relatively few edges. This
is especially important for complicated knots where the number of edges
needed to adequately approximate the smooth ropelength would not be
practical. With this aim, a second, weighted-average, approach is ex-
plored. This technique provides surprisingly accurate approximations
with relatively few edges. Together, we provide both a theoretically-
sound approach with slow convergence and a practical approach with
fast convergence. Depending on the application, we expect that both
techniques will be useful.

2.1. Ropelength of knots tied on the perfect rope. Smooth rope-
length models perfect rope as a non self-intersecting tube with a C 1,1
knot as its core. For completeness, we include these deﬁnitions and
some properties of this knot energy.

Deﬁnition 1. For a C 1 knot K and x
K, let Dr(x) be the disk of
radius r centered at x lying in the plane normal to the tangent vector
at x. Let

The quantity R(K) is called the thickness radius of K. Deﬁne the
ropelength of K to be

Rope(K) = Length(K)/R(K) ,

where Length(K) is the arclength of K.

The thickness radius R(K) is the radius of a thickest tube that can
be placed about the knotted core K without self-intersection. Note
that in some of the literature, the thickness refers to the diameter of
this thickest tube, in which case the ropelength is half of what we use
here. The problem we face is how, knowing the shape of K, to ﬁnd
R(K).

Suppose we are given a concrete knot K and we are trying to repro-
duce it with an impenetrable tube. Thus, K serves here as the core of
the knotted tube. We have to pay attention to two types of interactions
between the tube’s normal disks that restrict the radius R of the tube.
(A) The interactions between the discs centered on pairs of points
K – these
located inﬁnitesimally close to the diagonal of K
normal disks will start overlapping when the curvature radius
is smaller than R.

×

(B) The interactions between the discs centered on points located
K – the disks will start overlap
away from the diagonal of K
when the Euclidean distance between the points is smaller than
2R.

Figure 1 illustrates the problem. These intuitive observations are

captured by the quantities below and the subsequent lemma.

Deﬁnition 2. For a C 2 knot K with unit tangent map T , let MinRad(K)
be the minimum of the radius of curvature measured at each of the
points on the knot. The doubly-critical self-distance is the minimum

lead to the development of singularities in the tube sur-
face. See the framed picture. Inﬂation of the conforma-

After reworking the deﬁnition of MinRad, one can extend Lemma 3
to include C 1 (and thus C 1,1 curves). The following is taken from [6].

Note that if K is a C 2 knot parameterized by arclength with unit tan-
gent map T , then MinRad(K) = 1/dil(T ). Thus, the dilation gives a
generalization for MinRad to knots that are C 1. Since MinRad and
1/dil(T ) are equal for C 2 knots, we use MinRad to denote 1/dil(T )
for all C 1 knots. If a knot is C 1 but not C 1,1, then dil(T ) =
, in
which case MinRad is assumed to be 0. In this paper, we are mainly
interested in C 1,1 knots, in which case dil(T ) is ﬁnite and MinRad is
positive. Alternate, but equivalent, approaches for deﬁning the rope-
length of C 1,1 knots are explored in [8, 3].

2.2. Ropelength of polygonal knots. As mentioned in the intro-
duction, the problem we face in analyzing knots provided by numerical
simulations is that they are not given in a smooth continuous form. For
instance, programs based on the SONO algorithm deliver equilateral
polygonal knots. Let P be such a knot. It is represented by a sequence
of n points whose positions are indicated by vectors ~v1, ~v2, . . . , ~vn. We
shall refer to them as the vertices or beads of the polygonal knot P
that one obtains by joining consecutive vertices. We deﬁne

points on a polygonal knot, we shall omit the vector notation.
Remark: Because the knots that we are considering are closed, when-
ever the vertex index k happens to be larger than n, we assume that
~vk = ~vk−n. Similarly, when the index happens to be smaller than 1, we
assume ~vk = ~vk+n.

In what follows, we will use the notion of the index distance ID

Note that alternate approaches have been appeared in [9, 21, 15, 10,
16, 5, 8, 17, 19, 4]. In the SONO simulations, the vertices of a knot
interact with each other as if they were spheres, the properties of which
will be later. Taking into account the representation, we shall extend
the notion of the thickness radius in terms of the virtual spheres. We do
this by deﬁning notions of MinRad and DCSD for polygons similar to
the characterization theorem (Lemma 4) for smooth thickness radius.

Deﬁnition 5. Suppose P is an equilateral polygonal knot with edge
lengths dl. Let

Rad(vi) =

dl
2 tan(θi/2)

where θi is the turning angle of the tangent vectors at vi. Note that
Rad(vi) is the radius of an arc of a circle α that can be inscribed in the
corner at vi so that α intersects both adjacent edges at the midpoint
and the tangent at the midpoints coincide with the tangents on α at
the midpoints. Let

The construction of the sphere thickness radius needs a few words
of explanation. Suppose P is an equilateral knot. Imagine that about
each of the vertices, there is a sphere of radius R. When R is larger than
dl/2, the spheres about nearby vertices intersect. The cases in which
dl/2 < R < dl/√2 need special attention, but since they never occur
in the simulations we eventually analyze, we exclude them assuming
implicitly in what follows that R > dl/√2. The surface of the union of
all spheres is bumpy, so we refer to this as the corrugated tube or bead
rope about the knot. The problem we face is to inﬂate the spheres as
much as possible without violating the condition of the self-avoidedness
of the corrugated tube formed by their union.

First, let us explain what we mean by self-avoiding in the case of
the corrugated tube. Consider three consecutive vertices vi−1, vi, and
vi+1 and the spheres Si−1, Si, and Si+1, around them all of radius R.
The spheres Si−1 and Si intersect at a circle Ci−1 whose radius equals
(dl/2)2. The spheres Si and Si+1 intersect at a circle Ci
RD =
of the same radius. Let Di−1 and Di be the disks ﬁlling the circles.
The disks are inclined at an angle equal to the turning angle θi. We
assume that the disks are hard and hence cannot overlap; thus, at most
they may become tangent at a single point. The latter happens when

MinRad(P )2 + (dl/2)2, all portions of the corrugated
tube are well-deﬁned locally and one must check if index-distant ver-
tices are too Euclidean-close. Let us explain, what we mean by stating
that the portions of the corrugated tube are well-deﬁned. Each por-
tion of the corrugated tube is a sphere with two pieces cut oﬀ. The
cutting planes are perpendicular to the polygon edges and are located
at the midpoints. Consecutive portions are thus connected with disks
of radius RD. As stated above, the disks are assumed to be hard and
they are not allowed to overlap. A portion of the corrugated tube
which fulﬁlls the condition is said to be well-deﬁned. If the Euclidean
distance between two vertices is smaller than 2R, the portions of the
corrugated tube would overlap. Thus, we check all the Euclidean dis-
tances between suﬃciently index-distant vertices and ﬁnd the smallest
one. This will be the value of 2SR(P ). This is a geometrical interpreta-
tion of the self-avoidedness conditions found in the deﬁnition of Rs(P ).
When R is chosen larger then SR(P ), we see the behavior shown in
Figure 3b.

We will be mainly interested in optimizing Rs, but to do so we need
a scale-invariant version of Rs. There are various ways to do this and
we explore two normalizations in the next section. The corrugation
will play a part in how the knot packs eﬃciently in these optimizing
conformations. In the short term, our goal is to show that for a suﬃ-
ciently “thick” polygon P , there exists a smooth knot inscribed in P

whose thickness radius is close to Rs(P ). We ﬁrst present the inscrib-
ing algorithm. A similar formulation for inscribing polygons appears
in [17].

Proposition 7. For a given n-edge equilateral polygonal knot P with

Proof. An arc αi of a circle of radius Rad(vi) can be inscribed at vi such
that αi is tangent to ~si−1 and ~si and intersects the adjacent edges at
the midpoints. Let KP be the result of inscribing arcs of radius Rad(vi)
at each vertex vi and removing the bypassed corners. Since there is no
overlapping of adjacent inscribed arcs, KP is well-deﬁned as a (possibly
self-intersecting) closed curve. The curve KP has a piece-wise constant
radius of curvature, and MinRad(KP ) = MinRad(P ). The knot KP
is C 1 and piecewise C 2, and thus, lies in the category of C 1,1 curves.

For each x on the inscribed curve KP , we deﬁne a unique point x′ on
P . If x is a midpoint on P , let x′ = x. Otherwise, x lies on an arc, say
αi, whose center is Ci. Let x′ be the intersection of the ray −→Cix with

For each x

generates the arc on which x lies. The midpoint of each edge has two
corresponding vertices. It will be convenient to think of the midpoint
as corresponding to each vertex in diﬀerent situations and this will not
pose any problems in this work. Note that the smaller θmax is, the
closer the inscribed curve KP will be to the polygon P .

The corrugated tube about the polygon is a union of many spheres,
some of which are allowed to intersect. The intersection between the

prove. We will need the following technical lemma.

The previous result is not sharp in general. However, for the sake of
this paper, it does provide a computable lower bound for the thickness
radius of KP . Furthermore, the length of KP , which is smaller than the
length of P , can be computed explicitly. We call Length(KP )/Rc(P )
the inscribed ropelength and denote it Lc. The value of Lc is an upper
bound for the ropelength of the inscribed KP , and as dl
0 (note that
changing dl aﬀects n, P , and KP ), our bound on R(KP ) approaches
Rs(P ). Since Rs(P ) > dl/√2, the inscribed arcs lie within the cor-
rugated tube about P , which guarantees that KP has the same knot
type as P . Since KP is a C 1,1 smooth knot with the same knot type as
P , we have a bound on the ropelength of one smooth knot within the
knot type. Thus, we have an upper bound for the minimum smooth
ropelength for the given knot type.

3. Interpretation of simulations performed with the

SONO algorithm

Let us now describe the SONO algorithm using the notions deﬁned
above. First notice that in discussing the ropelength of smooth knots,
we are considering knots K of a given length Length(K) looking for
their thickness radius R(K). The value R(K) is the maximum ra-
dius for which K could be inﬂated without violating the conditions
that the surface of the tube must remain self-avoiding. The value
Rope(K) = Length(K)/R(K) is the ropelength of K. The applica-
tion of the virtual inﬂation suggests numerical calculations in which
the inﬂation process forces the knot to change its conformation. Such
changes may maximize R(K) and thus minimize Rope(K). Working
with polygonal knots, it proves more convenient to consider a diﬀerent
scheme in the simulations: keep the sphere radius SR ﬁxed and shorten

ROPELENGTH OF TIGHT POLYGONAL KNOTS

13

the edge length dl so that the knot eventually arrives at a conformation
for which Rs(P ) = SR. This is the approach we discuss below.

3.1. Basic procedures of SONO. There are two essential proce-
dures on which SONO is based [13]. The basic goal of SONO is to re-
duce Length(P ) subject to the constraint that Rs(P )
SR, for some
ﬁxed rope radius SR. In practice, we choose SR = 1. The reduction
of the polygon length is achieved by reducing its edge length dl. We
aim at simulating equilateral knots; thus one of these procedures called
EqualizeEdges (EE), checks the length of the edges, and, if they diﬀer
from the desired value dl, introduces necessary corrections. Suppose
the distance si between vertex i and i + 1 is diﬀerent from the desired
dl value. Then the vertices are shifted toward new positions so that
their distance is closer to dl:

(0, 1/2]. Usually we work with c1 = 1/2.

c1 ∈
As a result of multiple applications of the procedure, the dispersion
of the edge lengths in the ﬁnal conformations becomes very small, and
thus, we consider the knots we get from our simulations as equilateral.
The second procedure called RemoveOverlaps (RO), checks the dis-
tances between the vertices. When the RO procedure ﬁnds that the
minimum distance 2SR is violated, the vertices vi and vj are shifted
away from each other to a distance equal to 2SR or, what proves to
speed up the initial stage of the tightening process, exceeding 2SR by
ǫ:

where c1 ∈
(0, 1/2] and is usually set equal to 1/2. The value of ǫ
changes during the tightening process. Initially it is of the order 10−2
and reaches the level of 10−7 at its end.

The procedures RO and EE are in some circumstances contradictory,
but their multiple application leads to simultaneous reduction of both
the overlaps and the dispersion of the edge lengths. Both parameters

When the edge length dl is small, the tightened polygonal knots
develop short regions where Rad(vi) tends to become small. An addi-

3.2. Physical sense of the SONO algorithm and practical de-
tails of simulations. Let us now discuss the physical sense of the
simulation based on the SONO algorithm. The simulated knot P can
be seen as tied on a closed necklace of beads. The necklace is unusual,
because its beads are unusual:

if their index distance ID(vi, vj)

hard spheres of radius SR and repel inﬁnitely hard. The RO procedure
simulates this interaction. Because of the action of the EE procedure,
the centers of the consecutive beads can be seen as connected with
nonextensible rods of controlled length dl. The rods are connected to
each other by elasticity free but angle-limiting joints. Each of the beads
has the shape of a sphere with two parts of it cut oﬀ. The cutting planes
are located in the middle of the edges which lead to it. Consecutive

beads are thus connected via disks of radius Rc =

procedure limits the angle between the consecutive rods to 2 arcsin dl

As a result, MinRad(P )

consecutive beads to overlap. At most they are allowed to become
tangent. Because of its construction, the surface of the bead rope is
not smooth. It is corrugated and the corrugation is more pronounced,
the larger the distance between consecutive beads. This distance is, of
course, the edge length dl.

The tightening process runs as follows. Suppose we start with a
loose conformation. The EE and RO procedures make the lengths of
all edges equal and remove overlaps between the beads. After multiple
applications of the procedures, the dispersion of the edge lengths and
the sum of all overlaps fall below a ﬁxed level. Then SONO reduces
the required edge length dl. Now, as the EE procedure tries to adjust
the length of the edges to the new value by shortening the distance
between consecutive beads, new overlaps may appear. Subsequently
they are removed by the RO procedure. And so on.

In the ﬁnal tight conformation, the dispersion of edge lengths and the
sum of all overlaps are smaller than 10−6 which allows us to consider the
closest beads as just touching. Keeping in mind that the CC procedure

The shrinking rope forces the knot to change its conformation. At
the end, we arrive at a conformation for which further shortening is no

longer possible because it creates non-removable overlaps. Obviously,
if the number of beads is small, the ﬁnal value of dl is large and the
bead rope is strongly corrugated. This may create problems, since the
knot is more likely to become stuck in a local minimum. The reason
for this is as follows: one part of the rope winding around another part
may get into a groove between consecutive beads even if shifting it to
another groove would allow further shortening of the rope. The shifting
will not be achieved by SONO, because it would need a (rather large)
temporary increase of the ropelength. Working with a small number of
beads, we set ǫ to a higher value to minimize these eﬀects. In general,
the tightening process should be seen as a physical experiment in which
the experimenter watches and adjusts the parameters.

3.3. The problem of ﬁnding the right ropelength, an experi-
mental approach. In Figure 6, we have the tightest conformations of
the trefoil knot found by SONO working with rope consisting of n =15,
30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 vertices.

It seems plausible that the best estimation of the minimal length of
the rope needed to tie a particular knot will come from analyzing the
polygonal conformation obtained for highest n. As seen in the ﬁgure,
at n = 480 the surface of the bead rope is visually smooth – the corru-
gation of its surface, so visible at n = 15, 30, 60, becomes undetectable
by the naked eye. The problem we face is that in tightening much
larger knots, for instance the (2, 99) torus knot, reaching this level of
the surface smoothness would require a very large number of beads,
which is both awkward and time-consuming. For practical reasons, it
is reasonable to limit the number of beads as much as possible. We
present a picture showing the details of the SONO tightened trefoil for
such a small n in Figure 7.

16

Figure 7. Details of a trefoil knot tightened by SONO.
The knot is tied on a piece of corrugated rope consisting
of n = 15 beads. The centers of the beads make the ver-
tices of the polygonal knot. The vertices are connected
with straight cylindrical edges.

Calculations run faster when n is small, but what about the accuracy
of the ropelength we can extract from the analysis of the ﬁnal, tight
conformation?

4. Ropelength of SONO knots

We are mainly interested in understanding the optimal conforma-
tions of Rs. However, Rs varies with scale, so one could always increase
Rs simply by scaling the polygon. In the second section, we explored
one way to normalize Rs, namely by analyzing the ropelength Lc of the
inscribed knot KP . In doing so, we overestimate the minimum rope-
length. In this section, we present a diﬀerent normalization that will
underestimate the ropelength. In the next section, we combine these
two notions to obtain a reasonable approximation of the minimum ro-
pelength with relatively few edges.

The simplest way to determine the ropelength is to sum the length

of all edges of the knot and divide by Rs(P ):

In what follows we shall refer to Lp as the raw polygonal ropelength.
In calculating the ropelength in such a simplistic manner, we implicitly
assume that the polygonal knot makes the axis of a rope of radius 1,
which is obviously wrong. Certainly, if the cylindrical segments of the
rope are not to overlap, the radius should be smaller. This becomes
clear for large dl. However erratic the raw polygonal length may seem,
it will prove to be very useful.

It is interesting to see how the values of the raw polygonal and in-
scribed ropelength behave in practice as n increases. For the sake of
convenience, Figure 8 shows both values plotted versus the edge length
dl.

First notice that as the edge length diminishes, the raw polygonal
and the inscribed ropelengths apparently converge to a common value.
We call this value the true ropelength, denoted L∞.
In spite of its
erratic nature, the raw polygonal ropelength converges faster than the
inscribed ropelength. The raw polygonal ropelength Lp underestimates
while the inscribed ropelength Lc overestimates the ropelength. Can

in the inset.

one ﬁnd a weighted average that will accurately estimate the ropelength
with relatively few edges? Below, we present a heuristic reasoning
which provides the answer.

4.1. The problem of ﬁnding the right ropelength, an analytic
approach. By looking at SONO tightened knots, see for instance Fig-
ure 9, one may notice that we often deal with pieces of a rope winding
around other pieces of the rope. At smaller n, the rope is strongly
corrugated. Thus, to be precise, we deal with pieces of a corrugated
rope winding around other pieces of the corrugated rope. In a model
situation shown also in the picture, the central piece is straight and
the other piece winds tightly around it. By analyzing the raw polygo-
nal and inscribed ropelength functions in this simpliﬁed model, we will
shed some light on their functioning in the description of tight knots.
To analyze the problem, we consider a still simpler case of a corru-
gated rope wound toroidally around a corrugated cylinder. See Figure
10.

In the latter case, we may perform a rigorous analysis of the ways
in which the raw polygonal and the inscribed ropelength estimate the
true value of the ropelength. The latter is known since it is simply the
length of a smooth torus winding tightly a smooth cylinder. Assuming

that both the cylinder and the torus are made of a tube whose radius
R = 1, the value is 4π.

Now, let us consider the corrugated torus on the corrugated cylinder.
Both of them can be seen as unions of spheres. We assume that all the
spheres have radius R = 1. The distance between consecutive spheres
is dl. Obviously, for an arbitrary dl there are problems with a clean
closing of the torus. In what follows we shall concentrate on a short
piece of the torus, so this is not problematic.

The best way to wind a piece of a corrugated rope around a straight
piece of the same rope is to wind it inside the groove between two
consecutive spheres. Figure 10 illustrates the situation. Our aim is
to ﬁnd the raw polygonal length and the inscribed ropelength of a
single piece of the rope and compare them with the true length of
the analogous piece of the torus wound tightly around the cylinder.
The relations we ﬁnd here should apply to the situation we face in
calculating the ropelength of the SONO tightened knots.

Let us look at Figure 11. Assume the distance between the spheres,
i.e. the polygon edge length, is dl. Since the corrugated rope is wound
within a groove, its spheres are at a distance r < 2 from the center O
of the axis of the corrugated cylinder. We get

r =

The distance is diﬀerent when the corrugated rope is wound not
within the groove, but on the hill of the corrugated cylinder. Here
r = 2.

value of Rc is the radius of the circles at which consecu-

smooth rope which can be safely placed inside the cor-
rugated rope. Its axis runs along the inscribed arcs.

corrugated rope runs both in the grooves and on the hills. It is thus
reasonable to assume an average r. It would be an error to calculate
the average as an arithmetic average, since the shape of the hills is not
saw-tooth. The hills have the form of circular arcs.

the raw polygonal dLp and inscribed rope dLc approximations diﬀer
from the true value dL. To get a clear quantitative estimation of er-

By looking at the picture, one can clearly see that dLp underesti-
mates while dLc overestimates the length of the segment. Perhaps an
appropriately weighted average of the values could provide a better
estimation of the true length. To check this, we solve the equation

(adLp + dLc)/(a + 1) = dL .

The functional dependence of the weight a on the edge length dl looks

very weak – at dl = 1, its value is close to 5, but as dl diminishes, it
converges quickly to 4. See Figure 14.

Since the relations between Lp, Lc and L∞ in tight knots should
be similar to the relations between dLp, dLc and dL, we arrive to the
conclusion that the weighted average

La = (4Lp + Lc)/5

should be almost independent of the edge length dl and, thus, it should
provide a good estimate of the L∞ value. To check the hypothesis,
we perform a series of tests. First of all, we calculate the weighted
average for the trefoil knot, whose Lp and Lc are plotted in Figure
15. Looking at the plot of La, one clearly sees that, as expected, it is
almost independent of dl.

Similar tests have been performed for the next torus knots: 51, 71

5. Discussion

Numerical experiments carried out by the SONO algorithm provide
us with polygonal knots which can be seen as skeletons of tight knots
tied on a corrugated rope. The vertices of the polygonal knots are
the centers of the spherical segments of the corrugated tube. As we
demonstrated, one can place a smooth tube of a smaller radius inside
the corrugated tube to obtain a smooth knot tied within a smooth
tube. We know that Lc, the bound on its ropelength, is larger than
the ropelength of the ideal knot. In observing the ropelength of the
inscribed knots, we see that it converges with the increasing number of
vertices to a value L∞, which can be seen as an upper bound for the
ropelength of an ideal knot. Determining the value of L∞ is a subtle
problem and shall not be discussed here; however, by combining the
results we obtained for ﬁnite n with the inscribing algorithm, we are
able to ﬁnd an upper bound for the ropelength of a few ideal knots.
For the trefoil knot, the bound equals 32.744, for the 51 knot it equals
47.203, for the 71 knot it equals 61.417 and for the 91 knot it is 75.728.
These are the most precise estimations of the upper bounds obtained
so far.

As said above, the Lc values we ﬁnd analyzing the polygonal knots
delivered by SONO can be seen as upper bounds for the ropelength
of their ideal smooth conformations. But what about the weighted
average values La? To see their utility we must adopt the less rigor-
ous point of view of an experimental physicist. The coordinates of the
polygonal knots delivered by SONO can be seen as results of measure-
ments carried out on knots tied on the corrugated rope. Analyzing the
experimental data, one ﬁnds that the knot length calculated according
to the raw polygonal length formula systematically increases with n
while the length calculated according to the inscribed arcs formula sys-
tematically decreases with n. Plotting the values together, one notices
that they converge to a common value: Lc from below, Lp from above.
One also ﬁnds that, located between the two plots, the plot of their
weighted average is almost ﬂat and horizontal. By looking at the La
values presented in the tables, one can clearly see that La provides a
good estimate of the ropelength, even at a small number of vertices.

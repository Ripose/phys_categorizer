Abstract

A basis set expansion is performed to ﬁnd the eigenvalues and wave functions for an electron on

a toroidal surface T 2 subject to a constant magnetic ﬁeld in an arbitrary direction. The evolution

of several low-lying states as a function of ﬁeld strength and ﬁeld orientation is reported, and a

procedure to extend the results to include two-body Coulomb matrix elements on T 2 is presented.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum dots with novel geometries have spurred considerable experimental and the-
oretical interest because of their potential applications to nanoscience. Ring and toroidal
structures in particular have been the focus of substantial eﬀort because their topology
makes it possible to explore Ahranov-Bohm and interesting transport phenomena [1, 2, 3, 4].
Toroidal InGaAs devices have been fabricated [5, 6, 7, 8] and modelled, [9] and toroidal car-
bon nanotube structures studied by several groups [4, 10, 11].

This work is concerned with the evolution of one-electron wave functions on T 2 in response
to a static magnetic ﬁeld in an arbitrary direction. The problem of toroidal states in a
magnetic ﬁeld has been studied with various levels of mathematical sophistication. Onofri
[12] has employed the holomorphic gauge to study Landau levels on a torus deﬁned by a strip
with appropriate boundary conditions and Narnhofer has analyzed the same in the context
of Weyl algebras [13]. Here, the aim is to do the problem with standard methodology:
develop a Schrodinger equation inclusive of surface curvature, evaluate the vector potential
on that surface, and proceed to diagonalize the resulting Hamiltonian matrix.

As noted in [14], ideally one would like to solve the N-electron case, but the single
particle problem is generally an important ﬁrst step, and while the N electron system on
ﬂat and spherical surfaces has been studied [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], the torus presents its own
diﬃculties. In an eﬀort to partially address this issue, the evaluation of Coulombic matrix
elements on T 2 is also discussed here.

This paper is organized as follows: in section 2 the Schrodinger equation for an electron
In section 3 a
on a toroidal surface in the presence of a static magnetic ﬁeld is derived.
brief exposition on the basis set employed to generate observables is presented. Section 4
gives results. Section 5 develops the scheme by which this work can be extended to the two
electron problem on T 2, and section 6 is reserved for conclusions.

with n = φ x θ. The normal component of A contributes a quadratic term to the Hamilto-
nian but leads to no diﬀerentiations in the coordinate normal to the surface as per Eq.(8).
There is a wealth of literature concerning curvature eﬀects when a particle is constrained to
a two-dimensional surface in three-space [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,
34, 35, 36, 37, 38], including some dealing with the torus speciﬁcally [39], but the scope of
this work will remain restricted to study of the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (9).

The Schrodinger equation (spin splitting will be neglected throughout this work) is more

3. CALCULATIONAL SCHEME

To proceed with a basis set expansion, Gram-Schmidt (GS) functions orthogonal over
the integration measure F = 1 + α cosθ must be generated. Fortunately, it is possible
to construct such functions almost trivially. The method for doing so has been described
elsewhere [40], so only the salient results will be presented below.

The τ1 = 0, θ

θ invariance of Hτ suggests that the solutions of the Schrodinger
equation be split into even and odd functions, and the primitive basis set can be taken to
possess this property;

4. RESULTS

Rather than present a large number of tables conveying little useful information per unit
page length, the focus will be on indicating how some low-lying states evolve as a function
of magnetic ﬁeld strength for two distinct orientations. Some remarks will also be made
regarding the general trend seen for higher excited states. Here the ratio α = a/R was set
to 1/2 as a compromise between smaller α where the states tend towards decoupled ring
functions and larger α which are less likely to be physically realistic.

νB0 splitting arising from B0 = 0, ν

Fig. 1 illustrates the evolution of the energy eigenvalue for ﬁve low-lying states as a
function of τ0 with τ1 = 0. The states are all distinct and are labelled in the caption. Not
= 0
shown are values trivially obtained from the
degeneracy. It is interesting that level crossings with attendant movement towards a ground
state with diﬀerent Kν occurs near integer values of τ0, though it is not immediately clear if
this is of real signiﬁcance. It is also of interest to show the sensitivity of the dependence of
Ψ∗ΨF on ﬁeld strength. Fig. 2 shows that even for moderate ﬁeld values (τ0 = 5 corresponds
to a ﬁeld of 1.3 T for a torus with R = 50 nm) the large eﬀective ﬂux as compared to atomic
or molecular dimensions causes substantial modiﬁcation to Ψ∗ΨF in the ground state. Fig.
3 is a plot of the ﬁrst positive parity excited state showing substantially less change due to
the ﬁeld than the lower state; the higher excited states respond more stiﬄy to B0.

±

The results given in Figs. 1-3 were for a ﬁeld conﬁguration that did not mix azimuthal
basis states. To investigate an asymmetric case, let τ0 = 0 and vary τ1 wherein no ﬁeld
threads the torus. Fig. 4 is analogous to Fig. 1 as described above with the notable
exception that the ν splitting is non-trivial (hence fewer distinct states are shown), and
there are no level crossings out to the maximum value considered. Figs. 5 and 6 show
contour plot results for two states at three ﬁeld strengths. Note that there is slightly more
dependence in θ when τ1 = 0 for the state displayed in Fig. 6 than in Fig. 5; the integration
measure acts to cancel the angular variation of the state displayed in Fig. 5.

5. EXTENSION TO COULOMB INTEGRALS

The two-electron problem on T 2 is complicated by the inability (at least by the author)
to ﬁnd a transformation that decouples the relative electron motion from their center of
mass motion as is easily done on R2 [42]. The obvious transformations do not lead to any
advantage over the method adopted by workers long used in atomic and molecular physics,
which is to evaluate the two-body matrix elements (supressing spin indices and physical
constants)

To evaluate the integral care must be taken with the >, < character of the radial factor in
the integrand. One way to proceed is as follows:

1. Fix θ1 = 0. At this point r1 is at its maximum; integrate the integrand of Eq.(27)
numerically over dθ2 from [0, 2π] by some suitable method to attain a value labelled by, say,
G0(θ1).

2. Set θ1 = δ. Integrate dθ2 with r> = r1, r< = r2 over the interval [δ, 2π

δ], then set

r> = r2 and r< = r1 from [2π

δ, δ]. This is Gδ(θ1).

−

3. Repeat the second step until the entire interval around the toroidal cross section is
covered. A table [G0(θ1), Gδ(θ1), G2δ(θ1)...] results that can then be integrated numerically.
The exchange term proceeds similarly; only the densities need modiﬁcation.

6. CONCLUSIONS

This work presents a method to calculate the spectrum and wave functions for an electron
on T 2 in an arbitrary static magnetic ﬁeld. Aside from the character of the solutions and
numerical data, perhaps the main result of this paper has to do with the ease with which
an arbitrarily large number of GS states can be trivially generated. Because every physical
interaction can eventually be expressed as a periodic function on T 2, matrix elements for
the interaction may then be evaluatued in closed form; hence the only restriction to doing
any problem on T 2 is matrix inversion.

The procedure employed here to generate observables lends itself to easy incorporation of
an arbitrary number of surface delta functions or other type of potential. This is important
because on a closed nanotube, in contrast to a macroscopic crystal, there are a relatively
small number charge carriers, so the continuum approximation may break down for smaller
torii. Clearly, the magnetic ﬁeld treated here will not be suﬃcient to comprise the general
case as soon as any sort of lattice structure breaking azimuthal symmetry is imposed on the
torus. However, the extension is simple to implement in Eq. (12), requiring only a few more
terms. It would be also be interesting to see the extension of the static case discussed here
to a time dependent laser control problem of the type in [43].

Some remarks should be made regarding the curvature potential VC well known to workers
in the ﬁeld of quantum mechanics on curved surfaces. It was shown in [44] that a full three
dimensional treatment of the problem of a particle near, but not necessarily restricted to
T 2, yields a spectra consistent with inclusion of VC added to the two dimensional surface
Hamiltonian. Here the potential could not be included without substantially increasing the
scope and complexity of the problem undertaken. It was shown in [45] that the inclusion
of a vector potential precludes a separation of variables into surface and normal degrees of
freedom; A added to the Schrodinger equation requires solving coupled diﬀerential equations
in the surface and normal variables, or if a basis set expansion is employed, a much more
complicated procedure to generate three-dimensional GS states.

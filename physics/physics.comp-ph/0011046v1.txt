Abstract

We discuss a new approach to three-dimensional electrical impedance
imaging based on a reduction of the information to be demanded from
a reconstruction algorithm. Images are obtained from a single mea-
surement by suitably simplifying the geometry of the measuring cham-
ber and by restricting the nature of the object to be imaged and the
information required from the image.
In particular we seek to es-
tablish the existence or non-existence of a single object (or a small
number of objects) in a homogeneous background and the location of
the former in the (x, y)-plane deﬁned by the measuring electrodes .
Given in addition the conductivity of the object rough estimates of its
position along the z-axis may be obtained. The approach may have
practical applications.

1 Introduction

The aim of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is to reconstruct the
R3 from
conductivity distribution σ(x) in the interior of an object Ω
electrical measurements on the boundary ∂Ω . For this purpose a number
of diﬀerent current distributions are applied to the surface of the object
via electrodes and the the resulting potentials on the surface are recorded.
Applications can be envisaged both in medicine and industry [1].

⊂

Conservation of the current j(x) and Maxwell’s equations in the quasi-
static limit lead to the following diﬀerential equation for the potential Φ(x):

[σ(x)

Φ(x)] = 0.

In the following we take as the object a rectangular box and investigate
whether statements on the conductivity distribution can be made if the sur-
face potential can only be measured on one side of the box. Such a model
relates to typical situation in geological and medical imaging.

The general inverse conductivity problem for the box requires current-
and potential-measurements for a large number (in principle inﬁnite) of ap-
plied current conﬁgurations on the surface of the box. For the reconstruction
of the conductivity distribution in this and related problems the boundary
conditions must be known precisely and all calculations of potentials be per-
formed with high accuracy. All these conditions are diﬃcult to be achieved
in practice, which explains the comparative lack of success of the impedance
method in medical applications.
In many cases, speciﬁcally breast cancer
screening, it is actually not absolutely necessary to have a complete image
of the region. If we restrict the reconstruction to a shadow on a plane and
require only rough information on size and location of the cancerous region,
the reconstruction can be done analytically using a single measurement.
This problem has also been discussed from diﬀerent points of view [2], [3].

2 Description of the problem

We are interested in the conductivity distribution σ(x) inside a rectangular
box with sides a, b, c, as pictured in ﬁgure (1 ).

We further assume that conditions are such that the resulting potential

can only be measured on the plane ∂Ωz=0 (see ﬁg.(1)).

Given σ(x) the resulting potential φ(x) can be obtained by solving the

This is our main result. It is obvious from Eq.(19) that the set
is a
complete orthogonal system in N(A)⊥. We have thus explicitly constructed

This generalized solution is still not continuous in the data and must be
regularized in a suitable manner. We employed for convenience mainly the
method of truncating the singular values or truncating the indices i, j in
Eq.(20). The latter procedure turns out to produce better images.

It should be pointed out that we only reconstruct a three dimensional

view the image at z = 0, because the images for z

We eﬀectively see a two-dimensional image, which represents a kind of
shadow of the object. For many purposes, when one is only interested in the
presence or absence of an object, this is suﬃcient information.

In Fig.(2) and (3) we present images obtained from synthetic data. We
also show how the image deteriorates when errors are assigned to the data.

Case (a) shows the image for two spheres of diameter 1.5 and 1 respectively

not larger!) as the object gets larger. The same eﬀect is observed when
the conductivity is increased. It is not possible to distinguish volume- from
conductivity eﬀects. Given additional information, e.g. that its conductivity
is constant and of a given magnitude, it may be possible to quantify this
observation and obtain a full three dimensional image of the object.

and radius r immersed in the box Ω ﬁlled with a liquid of conductivity 1.

Equation (23) guarantees the continuity of the potential while (24) describes
current conservation. These two equations determine the boundary condi-
tions on the surface of the sphere. The other three equations represent the
well-known boundary value problem of the Laplace equation. The Neumann
boundary condition (22) is given in (2,3,4). For κ = 1 one obtains φ0, the
solution of (6).

In the neighborhood of a suﬃciently small sphere, the change in potential

The variation of α with κ shows quite clearly the limited sensitivity of

EIT to changes of conductivity.

The potential φ = φ0 + δφ still does not satisfy the Neumann boundary
condition (22) on ∂Ω. It is described in textbooks how this problem can be
solved by an inﬁnite number of image dipoles. The subsequent violation of
the boundary condition on the sphere of Eqs: (23), (24) can be neglected for
suﬃciently small spheres.

The knowledge of δφ allows to calculate the generalized inverse according
to Eq.(20). For rough estimates and when the sphere is not to close to the
surface, the image dipoles can be neglected. As the conductivity of the sphere
is assumed to be known, Eq.(26) can be used to obtain an estimate of the
position and the volume of the sphere. As a test we measure the synthetic
data on the surface ∂Ωz=0 by 10
10 electrodes. Given the rough knowledge
of the coordinates (x0, y0) of the centre of the sphere, we ﬁt δφ of Eq.(26)
plus the background potential φ0 to data taken on neighboring electrodes.
As a typical example, we ﬁnd for data aﬄicted with 10% error, the following
results: z0 = 2.32 (instead of 2.0) and r = 0.56 (instead of 0.5).

×

In realistic applications the object to be detected will in general not be
spherical. Nonetheless one may obtain rough information on size and depth
of the location of the object by assuming a spherical shape and applying the
analysis above.

5 Conclusion

We have presented in this note an electric impedance imaging system based
on a speciﬁc simple geometry of the device which guarantees a uniform cur-
rent distribution in the case of constant conductivity. If we further impose
the condition that only a single object (or possible a small number of ob-
jects) is to be detected, then we show that an image can be obtained in
a single measurement of the surface potential. To test of the eﬀectiveness
of the method, we create synthetic data which can be aﬄicted with errors.
The image obtained by inverse problem techniques represents a projection or
shadow on the surface where the potential is measured. This image is amaz-
ingly stable against data errors. We also indicate how rough estimates on the
size and the depth of the object may be obtained. The actual construction
of such an imaging system is planned.

Abstract. –

An exact quantization rule for the Schr¨odinger equation is presented. In the exact quanti-
zation rule, in addition to N π, there is an integral term, called the quantum correction. For
the exactly solvable systems we ﬁnd that the quantum correction is an invariant, independent
of the number of nodes in the wave function. In those systems, the energy levels of all the
bound states can be easily calculated from the exact quantization rule and the solution for the
ground state, which can be obtained by solving the Riccati equation. With this new method,
we re-calculate the energy levels for the one-dimensional systems with a ﬁnite square well, with
the Morse potential, with the symmetric and asymmetric Rosen-Morse potentials, and with the
ﬁrst and the second P¨oschl-Teller potentials, for the harmonic oscillators both in one dimension
and in three dimensions, and for the hydrogen atom.

In the development of quantum mechanics, the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules of
the old quantum theory [1] occupy a position intermediate between classical and quantum
mechanics. The WKB approximation [2–4] is a method for the approximate treatment of
the Schr¨odinger wave function with another quantization rule [1]. Both quantization rules
are approximate. We are going to derive an exact quantization rule for the one-dimensional
Schr¨odinger equation:

Yang pointed out in a talk on monopole: “For the Sturm-Liouville problem, the fundamen-
tal trick is the deﬁnition of a phase angle which is monotonic with respect to the energy.” [5]
This phase angle is the logarithmic derivative φ(x) = ψ(x)−1dψ(x)/dx of the wave function
ψ(x). Due to the Sturm-Liouville theorem, φ(x) at any given point x = x0 is monotonic with
respect to the energy. From the Schr¨odinger equation (1), φ(x) satisﬁes the Riccati equation:

It shows that φ(x) decreases monotonically with respect to x between two turning points
V (x). Note that as x increases across a node of the wave function ψ(x) where
where E

, and then, decreases again. The Riccati
equation is a diﬀerential equation of the ﬁrst order so that it is much easier to ﬁnd a special
solution from the Riccati equation than from the Schr¨odinger equation.

Since φ(xA) > 0, φ(xB ) < 0, and φ(x) decreases monotonically in the region xA < x < xB,
the number N of nodes of φ(x) in that region is larger by one than the number of nodes of
1) of nodes of ψ(x)
the wave solution ψ(x). Due to the Sturm theorem, the number (N
increases as the energy E increases.

the quantum correction is independent of the number of nodes of the wave function for the
exactly solvable systems. In those systems, one is able to calculate easily the energy levels of
all bound states from the exact quantization rule and the solution of the ground state, which
can be calculated directly from the Riccati equation. With this new method, we are going to
re-calculate the energy levels of those systems.

V (x) = VB when x
π < x < π, is a typical example in the course of
quantum mechanics. However, the solutions can be obtained with the exact quantization rule
much simpler than with the standard method. Since k(x) is constant between two turning
points, the quantum correction in the quantization rule is vanishing. For the ﬁnite square
well, two terms with limit in Eq. (4) has to be included in the quantization rule (6) because
the potential jumps at the turning points. The energy levels of the system is directly given in
the quantization rule (6) and (4) [6]:

potential. We ﬁnd that the quantum correction term is independent of the number of nodes in
the wave function for the exactly solvable quantum systems. In such cases, the energy levels
of the quantum system can be easily solved from the exact quantization rule and the solution
of the ground state calculated directly from the Riccati equation. For the non-exactly solvable
systems, one can use the series form of the quantization rule for numerical calculation [8].

As is well known, the wave functions and the energy levels for the exactly solvable systems
can also be solved by the supersymmetry in the recursive way [9]. The logarithmic derivatives
φ(x) are nothing but the superpotentials in the supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The
shape invariance of the superpotentials seems to be related to the condition of the quantum
correction being an invariant. As far as the wave function ψN (x) with (N
1) nodes is
concerned, we prefer to calculate its logarithmic derivatives φN (x) directly from the Riccati
equation (3). Although there are more or less diﬀerences for diﬀerent examples, the solution
for φN (x) can be taken as a fraction, where the numerator is a polynomial of order N and the
denominator is a polynomial of order (N
1)
poles. Without loss of generality, the coeﬃcient of xN −1 in the denominator can be chosen
to be one. Substituting it into the Riccati equation (3), one obtains a coupled algebraic
equations of order two for the coeﬃcients. Therefore, φN (x) can be solved. We have solved
some examples for the lower excited states.

An eﬃcient method for calculating the electronic structure in large systems with a fully converged
BZ sampling is presented. The method is based on a k · p−like approximation developed in the
framework of the density functional perturbation theory. The reliability and eﬃciency of the method
are demostrated in test calculations on Ar and Si supercells.

In periodic systems the correct description of electronic
structure requires an exhaustive sampling of the Brillouin
Zone (BZ). However for large systems, such as those that
are employed in ab-initio molecular dynamics, this can
be too expensive and very often the sampling is limited
to the Γ point of the BZ. This is quantitatively accurate
for very large systems and/or wide gap insulators.
In
all the other cases a correct sampling of the BZ is to
be recommended. Another limitation of Γ calculations is
the very coarse description that they give of the electronic
density of states, even for rather large supercells.

However, since full BZ sampling can be too costly,
k · p−like approaches have been suggested by several au-
thors in order to include k 6= 0 states at reduced com-
putational costs [1][2]. In these works it has been sug-
gested that the calculation of the k dispersion of eigen-
values can be conducted in a restricted Hilbert space.
Robertson and Payne [1] have proposed that this Hilbert
space could be constructed from the occupied and a lim-
ited number of unoccupied eigenfunctions of the Γ only
KS Hamiltonian. Since by increasing the number of un-
occupied states one converges to the exact result, this
method is in principle exact. Unfortunately, the number
of excited states that needs to be included in order to
achieve a satisfactory convergence is large, therefore this
approach has had limited impact. Kohanoﬀ and Scan-
dolo [2] have proposed a procedure in which the basis
vectors of the Hilbert space are variationally improved,
along with the electronic wavefunction coeﬃcients. Still,
in the non-local PP formalism, this procedure would be-
come rather expensive and actually it has been applied
only to the local PP, which is quite restrictive.

Here we adapt a recently developed version of density
functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [3][4][5] to cal-
culate the ﬁnite k corrections. We show that this can
give very accurate energies for systems of a few hundred
atoms for a semiconductor like Si, and even smaller for
an insulator like Ar, producing a signiﬁcant improvement
of the Γ only sampling at reduced computational cost.
Furthermore we show that for large systems, the Hilbert
space of the occupied eigenstates supplemented by the

perturbative corrections provide an excellent description
of the electronic density of states (DOS) at a much re-
duced computational cost.

We shall restrict ourselves to the case of a semiconduc-
tor or insulator, where all states ψkm(r) labeled by the
state index m and by the BZ vector k are doubly occu-
pied. We shall develop our method within the context
of pseudopotential (PP) formalism, but it can easily be
In or-
extended to other electronic structure schemes.
der to be deﬁnite we shall consider fully non-local PP
of the Kleinman-Beylander type [6] composed of a local
part, Vloc(r), and a non-local part,
I,L |PI,LiωLhPI,L|,
where the sum runs over all nuclei I and the angular mo-
mentum channels L. The Bloch theorem [7] allows us to
write ψkm(r) = ukm(r)eik·r where ukm(r) has the lattice
periodicity.
In terms of the ukm the Kohn and Sham
(KS) density functional [8] can be rewritten as

EHxc is the sum of the Hartree and exchange and corre-

the deﬁnition of the energy functional the orthonormality

For large unit cells, the BZ is very small and the func-
tional in Eq.(2) can be expanded in k. The k dependence
is in part explicit and in part implicit through the depen-
dence of ukm on k, which to linear order can be written

ukm(r) = u(0)

where the u(0)

the results of a Γ only calculation, and the u(1)

ﬁrst order corrections. Since in the absence of a magnetic
ﬁeld, u(0)
αm’s can be made real the ﬁrst order
correction to the density vanishes identically.
To the second order in k, E(k) becomes:

It can be seen that E(2) has the same structure as the
standard form of the variational DFPT [5]. The only
peculiarity is that the quadratic terms describing the ef-
fect of the change in ρ due to the perturbation are ab-
sent. Such a simpliﬁcation is a consequence of the na-
ture of the perturbation and occurs also, for instance,
in the case of the calculation of NMR chemical shifts

purely local PP the perturbation appears as a coupling
to the current operator −i∇, as is to be expected from
a k · p scheme. Since it is well known that a non-local
PP also aﬀects the current operator, it is not surpris-
ing that in the non-local case some extra perturbation
terms appear. We note that as written in Eq.(6) the k
expansion has only a formal character, since the posi-
tion operator, in the non-local PP terms, is ill deﬁned in
a periodic system. If however we express the full non-
local PP projectors in the reciprocal space and then ex-
pand in k the non-local energy terms, we arrive at well-
deﬁned expressions that can be straightforwardly calcu-
lated [9]. In practice we ﬁrst perform a Γ only calculation
and then, using the variational DFPT module developed
in our group [5], we perform three separate variational
calculations to determine {u(1)
zm}. The calcula-
tions of {u(0)
αm} can take full advantage of the
fact that these quantities are real. Once the {u(1)
αm} are
known, ∆αβ = δ2E/(δkαδkβ)|k=0 can be evaluated and
summing over the BZ we arrive at the following energy

Therefore, the computational eﬀort required by the
whole procedure is comparable to the optimization of
four independent sets of wavefunctions [5] and it does
not depend on the number of k-points used in the BZ
sampling.

We tested the eﬃciency of the method on the crys-
talline systems of Ar and Si. For these two systems we
have considered supercells of increasing size and com-
pared the Γ only calculation with and without the per-
turbation theory correction to the exact result obtained
performing a full BZ sampling in the primitive cell.

The Ar f cc unit cell, with 9.94 a.u.

lattice constant,
contains one atom and 8 valence electrons. We describe
this system by means of a Goedecker PP [10] and the
LDA functional. The converged total energy is achieved
by the standard CPMD [11] wavefunction optimization,
over a (8 × 8 × 8) Monkhorst-Pack (MP) [12] mesh in
the BZ of the primitive cell. Calculating the total energy
with the Γ point only produces errors which decreases
with the system size, as shown in Fig. 1. As expected in
this case, since Ar bands are rather ﬂat, the k·p approach
converges very rapidly with the system size.

We turn now to the study of the prototypical semicon-
ductor, Si. The Si unit cell contains 2 atoms and 8 va-
lence electrons. In this case we use the Troullier-Martins
norm-conserving PP [13] and the Ceperley-Alder local
density approximation to the exchange-correlation term
[14]. Convergence of total energy for this unit cell is
achieved by an integration over the (15 × 15 × 15) MP
mesh. As shown in Fig. 2, the DFPT correction produces
an important improvement, such that the total energy er-

ror is reduced by one order of magnitude for 128-atom
size, and to less than 0.001% in the case of the 250-atom
supercell. Of course since the Si bands are much broader
than those of Ar, convergence for Si is slower.

Unfortunately the calculation of ∆αβ by DFPT pro-
vides only the estimation of the total energy, which de-
pends on the sum over the occupied state eigenvalues,
and the contribution of the individual states cannot be

separated. This is however necessary if one wishes to
calculate the electronic density of states. We show here
that a very good electronic density of states can be ob-
tained if for any k one diagonalizes the k dependent KS

The matrices
hu(1)
βni can be calculated only once and then stored
for later use. Similarly it can easily be shown that most
of the matrix elements of H(k) can be expressed in terms
of k independent matrices, which can be calculated out-
side the k loop. The only exception is the non-local
PP term, which requires the evaluation of the projec-
tors hPIL|eik·r|u(0)
m i and hPIL|eik·r|u(1)
βmi. However, fully
in the spirit of our method, we can expand these projec-
tors to second order in k, which reduces the evaluation
to a linear combination of k independent quantities.

We have tested our method on Ar and Si. Once again,
for Ar the convergence is very fast and already for the
32-atom supercell, the k·p approach gives results that are
practically indistinguishable from the real ones. We illus-
trate here the more interesting case of Si. In Fig. 3(a) we
report the Γ point only DOS, as resulted for a 128-atom

of the real DOS. For the same system a much better de-
scription can be obtained using a (4 × 4 × 4) MP mesh, as
shown in Fig. 3(b). In the same picture we demonstrate
that our method gives accurate results and that the use
of the expansion in the evaluation of the non-local PP
introduces only small errors. While the result of the full
calculation and of the k · p method are comparable, the
latter is computationally more eﬃcient by at least two or-
ders of magnitude. This allows us to calculate easily the
electronic DOS for the 128-atom supercell including 4096
k points on an Intel Xeon PC. The result is compared in
Fig.4 with the DOS obtained by a standard method on

tributed k points. The only symmetry used is inversion.
For both calculations the tetrahedron method [15] was
used in order to perform the k point integration in the
BZ. The very good agreement between the two curves
demonstrates the usefulness of our approach.

In conclusion, we have shown that even for systems
that are by present computational standards modest in
size, the k · p method implemented here is accurate and
computationally eﬃcient.
It is therefore now possible
to perform eﬃcient ab-initio molecular dynamics calcu-
lations with fully converged BZ sampling.

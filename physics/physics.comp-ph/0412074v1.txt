Abstract

We present an exact mathematical transformation which converts a wide class of advection-

diﬀusion equations into a form allowing simple and direct spatial discretization in all dimensions,

and thus the construction of accurate and more eﬃcient numerical algorithms. These discretized

forms can also be viewed as master equations which provides an alternative mesoscopic interpre-

tation of advection-diﬀusion processes in terms of diﬀusion with spatially varying hopping rates.

INTRODUCTION

Advection-diﬀusion equations (ADEs) describe a broad class of processes in the natural

sciences. As their name implies, they provide a continuum (macroscopic) representation of

systems whose underlying dynamics combines Brownian motion (diﬀusion) with some form

of deterministic drift (advection). In this paper we shall consider ADEs of the general form

∂tρ = ∇ · D∇ρ − ∇ · ρv .

(1)

The ﬁeld ρ typically describes the number density of “particles” which, depending on the ap-

plication, can range from electrons in a plasma, to chemical molecules advected in solution,

to colloidal particles, to biological cells moving along chemical gradients. In principle the

diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(x, t) and the velocity ﬁeld v(x, t) can depend on the density ﬁeld ρ.

An idea of the ubiquity of ADEs can be gauged from their diverse applications to traditional

physics, soft matter systems, and biology. A small subset of examples are magnetic fusion

plasmas [1], cosmic ray streaming [2, 3], electrons in weakly ionized gases [4], microemul-

sions under shear ﬂow [5], chemical kinetics in driven systems [6, 7], hydrodynamics and

chemotaxis of bacterial colonies [8, 9], phase ﬁeld dynamics in directional solidiﬁcation [10],

and a wide array of tracer diﬀusion problems (for example [11]).

It is generally not possible to analytically solve ADEs, especially since they often appear

within sets of non-linear coupled equations. For this reason, great emphasis has been placed

on numerical integration methods, typically based on ﬁnite diﬀerences. It has been found

that the advection term, despite its apparent simplicity, is extremely troublesome to handle

[12]. There are two major challenges: stability, which can be improved using a range of

implicit methods, and accuracy, which is a delicate issue, requiring the “best possible” form

of spatial discretization. Regarding the issue of stability, many schemes are in use, such

as the Crank-Nicholson/ADI and fractional step methods [12, 13], and the Lax-Wendroﬀ

method [14]. The issue of accuracy has received somewhat less attention with two spatial

discretization schemes (and their immediate variants) commonly in use: these are the simple

Taylor expansion [1, 15] and the “upwind” scheme [16, 17]. One of the main results of this

paper is the derivation of a new discretization scheme which is physically appealing, simple

to apply in all dimensions, and more accurate than those currently in use.

II. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE

To begin, let us present the key idea in the context of a simple ADE, namely, a one-

dimensional system with a velocity function proportional to the spatial derivative of a scalar

potential φ(x, t). Thus, we consider

∂tρ = D0∂2

xρ − α∂x(ρ∂xφ) ,

(2)

(3)

where D0 and α are constants.

Most numerical algorithms designed to integrate an equation such as (2) treat the diﬀusion

and advection terms separately [1, 12, 17]. The diﬃculties arise in ﬁnding a discretization

for the latter term. In doing so, two fundamental properties of the equation must be exactly

maintained. These are the non-negativity of ρ and its spatial conservation:

dx ρ(x, t) = const .

Z

As an illustration, let us write down a common spatial discretization using simple Taylor

expansion, which is used both for explicit Euler schemes [18], and as the basis for more

advanced implicit algorithms [12, 15, 16]. We replace the continuous function ρ(x, t) by a

set of functions {ρi(t)} deﬁned on a regular grid with lattice spacing h. The equation of

motion for ρi is written using centered spatial derivatives:

dρi
dt

=

D0
h2 (ρi+1 + ρi−1 − 2ρi) −

α
4h2 [ρi+1(φi+2 − φi) − ρi−1(φi − φi−2)] .

(4)

It is noteworthy that this simple scheme requires knowledge of the scalar ﬁeld φ at next-

nearest neighbor grid points rather than neighboring grid points. For future reference we

rewrite this discrete equation in the following manner:

(5)

which we shall hereafter refer to as the “linear centered discretization” (LCD) (and which

resembles the backward Euler scheme used for simple advection problems [12]).

We now turn to a new discretization scheme which emerges from a simple mathematical

transformation of the ADE (2). Deﬁning γ = α/2D0 it can be veriﬁed by direct diﬀerentia-

tion that Eq.(2) may be written as

∂tρ = D0

eγφ ∂2

x(ρe−γφ) − e−γφρ ∂2

x(eγφ)

.

(6)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

A similar transformation involving exponential functions is known for Fokker-Planck equa-

tions [19]. The simple ADE given in (2) can indeed be formally interpreted as such an

equation, although the physical origin is quite diﬀerent. We will shortly be considering

more general ADEs in which the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and velocity function can be functions

of the density ρ. Clearly then the simple correspondence with Fokker-Planck equations

breaks down, although we are still able to achieve a transformation of the kind given above.

The crucial feature of Eq.(6) is that spatial derivatives only enter in the form of a second

derivative ∂2

x which is straightforward to discretize. Using the simplest such discretization

we immediately have

dρi
dt

=

D0
h2

(cid:2)

ρi+1e

−γ(φi+1−φi) + ρi−1e

−γ(φi−1−φi) − ρi(e

−γ(φi−φi+1) + e

−γ(φi−φi−1))

.

(7)

There are a number of points to make concerning this equation. First, in contrast to

(cid:3)

the LCD (4), the scalar ﬁeld appears in a non-linear fashion, and is sampled at nearest-

neighbor positions. Second, the new equation is of the same form as a master equation

[15, 19, 20]. Within this analogy one can think of ρi as the probability that a ﬁctitious

particle is located at grid position i. The transition rate for the particle to hop from grid

point i to a neighboring point j is of the Arrhenius form

Wi→j = (D0/h2) exp[−γ(φi − φj)] .

(8)

Given this formal analogy with a master equation for a probability function, one immedi-

ately sees that Eq.(7) exactly maintains conservation of the function ρ (normalization of

probability) and its non-negativity. Due to this analogy we hereafter refer to Eq.(7) as the

“master equation discretization” (MED).

Our numerical work (see section V) shows that the MED is more accurate than the LCD

and other popular discretizations. To appreciate the underlying reason for this, it is helpful

to consider the case of γδφ ≪ 1 in which case we can expand the exponential functions in

Eq.(7) to ﬁrst order. One then ﬁnds

Comparison of this form with Eq.(5) gives useful insight into the potential weakness of the

LCD. Namely, it neglects an important curvature term in the scalar ﬁeld.

In fact, this

4

omission is directly related to artiﬁcial (or “numerical”) diﬀusion, which is a common failing

of other discretization schemes, most notably, the “upwind” scheme [12, 16, 17]. The linear

scheme given above in Eq.(9) can of course be regarded as one of many possible linear

discretizations, but without the derivation given here one would have no a priori reason to

prefer it over forms such as the LCD, since they both have non-vanishing second-order errors

in space. Continuing the expansion of the exponential terms in powers of α yields crucial

non-linear corrections to Eq.(9) which have no analogy within linear discretization schemes.

As shall be seen below, the MED is easily formulated for the d-dimensional extension of

Eq.(2) as well as for a range of more general ADEs.

III. THE GENERAL CASE

Consider the general ADE in d-dimensions given in Eq.(1). We shall now proceed to

transform this equation into a form amenable to the MED. In one dimension we shall ﬁnd

that this is possible for general functions D and v. In higher dimensions the vectorial nature

of the velocity ﬁeld will place a constraint on the transformation.

Let us introduce two scalar functions f (x, t) and g(x, t) deﬁned via the relations

D = f g ,

v = g∇f − f ∇g .

Then the ADE (1) has the explicit form

∂tρ = ∇ · [f g∇ρ] − ∇ · [ρ(g∇f − f ∇g)] .

By direct diﬀerentiation one can show that this equation may be rewritten as

∂tρ = f ∇2(gρ) − gρ∇2f .

Once again, we see that the spatial derivatives appear only as Laplacians, which allows us

to immediately write down a simple discrete form. Let us deﬁne the discrete Laplacian via

∇2Q(x) =

1
h2

′

(Qj − Qi) ,

j
X
where the sum is over nearest neighbors j of the grid point i, which corresponds to the

continuum position x. Then the MED corresponding to Eq.(13) is

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

∂tρi =

[Wj→i ρj − Wi→j ρi] ,

′

j
X

where the transition rate for “hopping” from site i to site j is

Wi→j = fj gi/h2 .

(16)

Having formulated the MED in this general manner, let us examine some particular cases.

We stress that once the functions f and g are determined the discrete algorithm is completely

deﬁned via the transition rate given above.

First, we consider one dimension. In this case it is possible to integrate Eqs. (10) and

(11) exactly to ﬁnd the necessary auxiliary functions f and g in terms of the physically

relevant diﬀusion coeﬃcient and velocity. One ﬁnds

f (x, t) = C

D(x, t) exp(S), S(x, t) =

p

x

,

with g then given trivially from (10). The transition rate is easily evaluated from (16) to

give

Wi→j =

exp[−(Si − Sj)] .

DiDj

p

A non-trivial application of this general solution would be advection-diﬀusion in the kinetic

theory of gases where the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is non-constant, and actually depends on

the density as D ∝ 1/ρ [21]. In higher dimensions a general solution for f and g is not

possible. Solvable cases will rely on special conditions for D and v reminiscent of the

potential conditions for the existence of steady-state solutions to the multi-variate Fokker-

Planck equation [19, 20].

For many problems the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is constant (D0) and the velocity function

is associated with a scalar potential via v = α∇φ. In these cases, the analysis leading to

Eq.(8) is easily generalized to d dimensions and one ﬁnds the discrete equation (15) with

(17)

(18)

Wi→j = (D0/h2) exp[−γ(φi − φj)] ,

(19)

where we remind the reader that γ = α/2D0. As found in one dimension, this scheme

includes important curvature terms, even within a linear approximation, which are absent

in conventional LCD algorithms. Numerical analysis shows such terms to be essential in

regions where φ has maxima or minima.

The MED scheme encapsulated in Eqs. (15) and (19) can be used to model more com-

plicated ADEs in which there is non-linear feedback. An interesting example of this is the

6

continuum theory of group dynamics, in which a non-linear and non-local feedback mecha-

nism is imposed via the velocity potential [22, 23]. In particular one has

φ(x, t) =

ddx′V (x − x′)ρ(x′, t) ,

(20)

Z

where V is analogous to a potential, and is responsible for long-range attraction and short-

range repulsion of individuals. If V is a Dirac δ-function then φ ∝ ρ. Such models are used

to describe density-dependent dispersal in population dynamics [22] and have recently been

shown to arise from excluded volume eﬀects in models of interacting cellular systems [24].

A second well-known example is the Keller-Segel model for chemotactic motion [9]. Here,

the potential φ represents the chemoattractant concentration ﬁeld and is coupled to the cell

density ﬁeld ρ via

∂tφ = ν∇2φ − λφ + βρ ,

(21)

where ν, λ and β are the diﬀusion constant for the chemical ﬁeld and its rate of degra-

dation and production respectively. This equation is easily discretized and the resulting

discrete chemical concentration ﬁeld may be inserted into the transition rate (19) allowing

a straightforward scheme for integration of the cell density.

IV. FINE-TUNING THE MED ALGORITHM

From numerical investigations (see next section) we have found that the MED is generally

far more accurate than both the LCD and upwind schemes. In regions where the velocity

function has strong spatial variation, the MED does an excellent job in predicting the correct

density even for grid scales approaching the scale of variation of the velocity. However, in

the “simpler case” when dynamics are dominated by advection in a region of quasi-constant

velocity, the MED fares less well. This problem can be traced back to the exponential

weights yielding, in regions of constant velocity, an over-estimated drift velocity. In terms

of a hopping process, the bias in hopping rates between neighboring sites is proportional to

sinh(γδφ), whereas the correct drift velocity is simply proportional to γδφ.

We discuss here two straightforward extensions to MED which alleviate this problem, but

also lead to slightly less accurate algorithms in the “non-trivial” regions where the velocity

is strongly varying. Both extensions amount to a renormalization of the hopping rates.

An ideal algorithm would be a hybrid, using the original MED and either of the following

7

extensions in appropriate regions. We will not discuss such hybrid schemes here since their

form will be strongly dependent on actual applications.

For simplicity let us consider again the one-dimensional ADE given in Eq.(2). The MED

scheme for this case in given in Eq.(7), where the transition rate from site i to neighboring

site j has the explicit form

Wi→j = (D0/h2) exp[−γ(φi − φj)] .

(22)

It is clear from (22) that the eﬀective drift velocity arising from the bias in hopping rates

between i and j is

veﬀ = h(Wi→j − Wj→i) = (2D0/h)sinh[α(φj − φi)/2D0] ,

(23)

where we have reinstated γ = α/2D0 for clarity. The correct drift velocity between these

two points is simply α(φj − φi)/h which is recovered if the grid scale is small (or else the

velocity potential is slowly varying).

In order to correct the MED algorithm one may either renormalize the eﬀective diﬀusion

coeﬃcient (which is the pre-factor of the exponential weight) or else renormalize the param-

eter γ which appears in the argument of the exponential. In the former case one has, on

ﬁtting the drift velocity to its correct value, the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient

Deﬀ = D0

αδφ/2D0
sinh(αδφ/2D0)

which leads to the MED transition weight taking the “Fermi-Dirac” (FD) form

Wi→j =

D0
h2

α(φi − φj)/D0
exp[α(φi − φj)/D0] − 1

.

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

The alternative is to correct the drift velocity by adjusting γ, which leads to

Numerically one ﬁnds that the FD form (25) is generally more accurate than the SR form

(27), and that both are superior to the LCD and upwind schemes. As already mentioned,

the original MED scheme deﬁned by Eq.(22) is the best of all the schemes described when

the velocity ﬁeld is strongly varying, and/or during asymptotic relaxation of the density

ﬁeld to its steady-state.

V. NUMERICAL WORK

We have made a careful numerical analysis of the simple one-dimensional ADE given in

Eq.(2), along with its two-dimensional extension. Since we wish to gauge the accuracy of

our new scheme, we have compared the MED scheme (7), and its variants (the MED(FD)

given in (25), the MED(SR) given in (27), and the linearized MED, denoted by MED(LIN),

given in (9)), with both the LCD and upwind schemes [12]. In one dimension we use a static

velocity potential given by φ(x) = [1 + cos(2πnx/L)]/2 with n = 16 and L = 12.8. The

initial density function is taken to be uniform in the region x ∈ (−3, 3) and zero otherwise.

The density is normalized to unity and periodic boundary conditions are enforced. This set-

up provides a challenging test of all the schemes since the velocity ﬁeld is a strongly varying

function of position. Furthermore, we challenge the methods by using the parameter values

D0 = 1.0 and α = 5.0 (Figure 1) and α = 20.0 (Figure 2), which correspond to moderate to

high grid Peclet numbers [1] at the grid scales of interest. Here, the largest Peclet numbers

are approximately given by 2αh and so vary between 0.25 and 8 for the data shown in

Figures 1 and 2. The dynamics consists of a rapid transient phase where the density ﬁeld

adapts to the periodic structure of the velocity ﬁeld, followed by a slower relaxation towards

the steady-state. Thus, the numerical analysis probes each scheme’s ability to track rapid

advective motion and diﬀusive relaxation around maxima and minima of the velocity ﬁeld.

In order to assess the accuracy of the methods we ﬁrst run all schemes at a very small grid
size of h = 0.00625, using an explicit temporal scheme with δt = 10−6. Very good agreement

is found among all the schemes and the solution is denoted “exact.” We then run all the
schemes at larger grid scales using δt = 10−4, and dynamically compare the approximate

solutions with the exact one. This is gauged using the relative error, which is deﬁned via

[ρi(t) − ρi,exact(t)]2

E(t) =

i
P

ρi,exact(t)2

(28)

Note, that δt is chosen small enough such that any diﬀerences between our ﬁrst-order tem-

poral discretization for LCD and second-order schemes (in the temporal dimension) such as

i
P

9

Crank-Nicholson or Lax-Wendroﬀ are negligible. Figures 1(a)-(e) show E(t) for grid scales

h = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 respectively, for α = 5.0. The entire dynamical evolution

up to the steady state is shown. In the ﬁrst four panels we clearly see that the MED and

its (nonlinear) variants give a relative error approximately 10 times less than the LCD and

UW schemes. (Note UW does not appear in 1(a) since its error is too large to be usefully

included in the ﬁgure.) The relative errors of all the schemes increases roughly by a factor

of 10 as the grid scale is doubled. Panel 1(e) shows the breakdown of all the schemes at the

scale h = 0.4 which is comparable to the period of the velocity ﬁeld. By “breakdown” we

mean a relative error of 10% or more. To give an idea of the spatial form of the density ﬁeld

near the steady-state we show in Figure 1(f) the exact density proﬁle in a peripheral region,

along with the LCD and MED (FD) at a grid scale of h = 0.2 for comparison. Note the

LCD fails to capture the magnitude of the maximum density, and also becomes negative at

some grid points.

In a similar fashion, ﬁgures 2(a)-(d) show E(t) for h = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 respec-

tively, for α = 20.0. As before the non-linear MED schemes perform far better than the

LCD and UW, meaning the relative error is roughly 10 times smaller for a given grid scale.

Note also that the MED(FD) and MED(SR) algorithms perform better than MED during

the transient period, as expected. All schemes break down for h = 0.2. In Figure 2(e) we

show the exact density proﬁle close to the steady-state, compared with the MED and LCD

schemes for h = 0.1. Again, the LCD shows negative values and fails in the vicinity of the

density peaks. Figure 2(f) is the same except the UW scheme is compared to the MED. The

UW scheme is designed to give non-negative densities, but has high (artiﬁcial) “numerical

diﬀusion” which inﬂate the width of the density peaks.

We have performed an exactly analogous numerical examination in two dimensions. We

integrated the 2D generalization of Eq.(2) using the potential φ(x, y) = [1+cos(2πnx/L)][1+

cos(2πny/L)]/4 with n = 16 and L = 12.8. We take D0 = 1.0 and α = 10.0. The initial

density function is uniform in a disk of radius 3.0 and zero otherwise, and again normalized
to unity. The “exact” density proﬁle is evaluated using h = 0.0125 and δt = 0.25 × 10−4.

The two-dimensional extensions of all six schemes are integrated for grid scales of h =
0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 using δt = 10−4. The relative error E(t) for these cases is shown in

Figure 3(a)-(d), for a time period encompassing the initial rapid adaptation to the potential

followed by the early stages of relaxation to the steady-state. As with one dimension, the

10

MED and its (non-linear) variants perform far better than the LCD and UW, with the pure

MED scheme performing best at later times. All schemes break down for h = 0.2. Direct

comparison of the exact density proﬁle, MED, and LCD is given in Figures 3(e) and (f),

for h = 0.05 and h = 0.1 respectively, along a one-dimensional cut (y = 0) in a peripheral

region of the density. The MED shows excellent agreement, especially in the vicinity of the

density peaks. The LCD fails in the vicinity of the density peaks as expected.

From this and similar numerical work we have concluded that the MED and its (non-

linear) extensions are superior spatial discretization schemes compared to the LCD and

upwind schemes. The MED works especially well in regions of large variation in the velocity

potential. Generally speaking, for a given error tolerance, the MED and variants allow one

to use grid scales at least two times larger than traditional schemes, which translates into

a saving of at least a factor of 4 and 8 in computational cost for two and three dimensional

numerical analyses.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We end with some remarks on the non-linear transition rates of the MED. In most appli-

cations the ADEs represent processes for which there is no underlying lattice (e.g. cosmic

ray diﬀusion [3] or chemotactically moving cells [9]). When one discretizes the continuum

ADE one must therefore not regard the lattice version as “more fundamental” or “more mi-

croscopic.” It is simply a mathematical analog of the original equation and identical in the

limit of the lattice spacing being taken to zero. This is a diﬀerent situation to that found for

many models arising from solid state physics in which there is an underlying crystal lattice,

and for which the discrete equation can often be regarded as more fundamental (or, at least,

more microscopic) than continuum models. Although the hopping process encapsulated by

the MED cannot be viewed as the underlying microscopic dynamics, it is interesting that

ADEs can be accurately modeled by a process in which diﬀusion and advection are non-

linearly combined in Arrhenius transition rates. Figure 4 summarizes our understanding of

the algorithmic connections between ADE and the MED discretization, in which a given

ADE typically arises from a mean-ﬁeld approximation of a microscopic stochastic process

which is not constrained by a lattice.

Pragmatically one wishes to impose a “large” lattice scale for numerical eﬃciency, while

11

avoiding the loss of accuracy. Algorithms which remain accurate for larger lattice scales yield

great computational speed-up in higher dimensions, since the number of required grid points
(and hence computer operations) scales as h−d. We ﬁnd that our new scheme typically allows

grid scales between 2-4 times larger than traditional schemes, which in three dimensions

allows a potential speed-up in computation of one or two orders of magnitude. Naturally,

our improved spatial discretizations can be used in more advanced algorithms which use

implicit temporal methods and/or adaptive spatial grids.

In conclusion we have shown that a wide class of advection-diﬀusion equations can be ex-

actly rewritten in a form which immediately allows a direct and simple spatial discretization

in all dimensions. Our new discrete forms contain important non-linear terms, which when

linearized are seen to be related to the curvature of the velocity potential, such terms being

absent in commonly used discretization schemes. We have shown explicitly that these curva-

ture eﬀects are essential for accurate integration of ADEs, both in one and two dimensions,

and allow simple algorithms to be constructed which are accurate for grid scales up to the

size of spatial variation in the velocity ﬁeld. We estimate that our new algorithm may allow

a speed-up of ADE computation by factors of 10 or more in three dimensions due to the

increased grid scale one can impose. The fact that ADE can be recast as master equations

also yields interesting physical insight into their dynamics - namely that at mesoscopic scales

the processes of diﬀusion and advection may be modeled as a non-linear combination within

Arrhenius-like transition rates.

Figure Captions

Figure 1: Data from numerical integration of Eq.(2) using various schemes in one dimension,

with D0 = 1.0 and α = 5.0. The particular form of the velocity potential and the initial
density proﬁle are described in section V. The time step is δt = 10−4. Figures 1(a), (b),

(c), (d), and (e) show the relative error (28) as a function of time for grid scales of h =

0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 respectively. The methods used are upwind (UW), LCD

(4), linearized MED (9), MED (7), “Fermi-Dirac” version of MED (25), and “square-root”

version of MED (27). Figure 1(f) compares the exact density proﬁle in the peripheral region

x ∈ (2, 3.6) with both the MED(FD) scheme and the LCD scheme at time t = 0.1 using

h = 0.2. In Figures 1-3, time is measured in units of δt, space in units of h, and the density

in dimensionless units.

Figure 2: Same as Figure 1, but with α = 20.0. Figures 2(a), (b), (c), and (d) show

the relative error (28) as a function of time for grid scales of h = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and

0.2 respectively. Figure 2(e) compares the exact density proﬁle in the peripheral region

x ∈ (2, 3.6) with both the MED scheme and the LCD scheme at time t = 0.02 using h = 0.1.

Figure 2(f) is the same as 2(e) but compares the exact proﬁle with both MED and UW.

Figure 3: Data from numerical integration of the two-dimensional generalization of Eq.(2)

using various schemes, with D0 = 1.0 and α = 10.0. The particular form of the velocity
potential and the initial density proﬁle are described in section V. The time step is δt = 10−4.

Figures 1(a), (b), (c), and (d) show the relative error (28) as a function of time for grid

scales of h = 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 respectively. The methods used are two dimensional

generalizations of upwind (UW), LCD (4), linearized MED (9), MED (7), “Fermi-Dirac”

version of MED (25), and “square-root” version of MED (27). Figure 3(e) compares the

exact density proﬁle along a cut (y = 0) in the peripheral region x ∈ (2, 3.6) with both the

MED scheme and the LCD scheme at time t = 0.01 using h = 0.05. Figure 3(f) is the same

as 3(e) except that a larger grid scale of h = 0.1 is used.

Figure 4: A schematic diagram summarizing the relationships between various descrip-

tions of advection-diﬀusion processes. The MED is a useful mesoscopic description in terms

of Arrhenius hopping rates, rather than a reﬂection of the underlying dynamics.

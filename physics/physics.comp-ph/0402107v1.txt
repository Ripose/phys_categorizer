Abstract.
Intense-ﬁeld ionization of the hydrogen molecular ion by linearly-polarized light
is modelled by direct solution of the ﬁxed-nuclei time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation and
compared with recent experiments. Parallel transitions are calculated using algorithms which
exploit massively parallel computers. We identify and calculate dynamic tunnelling ionization
resonances that depend on laser wavelength and intensity, and molecular bond length. Results
for λ ∼ 1064 nm are consistent with static tunnelling ionization. At shorter wavelengths
λ ∼ 790 nm large dynamic corrections are observed. The results agree very well with recent
experimental measurements of the ion spectra. Our results reproduce the single peak resonance
and provide accurate ionization rate estimates at high intensities. At lower intensities our
results conﬁrm a double peak in the ionization rate as the bond length varies.

The mechanism of high-intensity ionization by infrared and optical wavelength light is often
considered a static tunnelling process. The simplicity of this model is hugely appealing
because of the ease of calculation. The ionization rates are effectively independent of
wavelength, and to some extent the internal structure of the molecule can be ignored [1]. A
|Ei|/2Up,
rough criterion for validity of this model is given by the Keldysh parameter, γk ≡
where the internal binding energy is (|Ei|) and the external laser-driven kinetic energy is
(Up). When the conditions are such that γk ≪ 1, the ionization process is dominated
by static tunnelling in which the shape of the potential strongly (exponentially) affects the
ionization rate. At certain critical distances between the nuclei, discovered by Codling and
co-workers [2], the ionization rate can rise sharply producing a sequence of fast fragments
ions at sharply-deﬁned energies. Predictions for ion yields and energies based on classical
arguments [1] agree very well with experiments even for large diatomic molecules such as I2.
The presence of critical distances would be evident in polyatomic molecules and is also seen
in small rare-gas clusters [3]. The tunnelling process is generally relatively fast compared
to the vibrational motion of the molecule, so the ﬁxed-nuclei approximation is reasonable.
However the tunnelling time may be longer than the optical period of the laser. Under these
conditions the process is more accurately termed a dynamic tunnelling process. In this paper
we provide evidence of just such effects for Ti:Sapphire light λ ∼ 790 nm at intensities
I ∼ 1014 W cm−2. Our theoretical results in this wavelength region do not agree with cycle-
averaged static ﬁeld models, however the results do agree well with the features observed in
experimental studies.

In a molecule with few electrons the ionization process can be studied quantally with few
approximations. For one-electron models, static-ﬁeld ionization resonances in the potential

wells
[4, 5, 6, 7] occur at distances far from the equilibrium internuclear separation and
tend to produce low-energy ions. Experiments have conﬁrmed the existence of enhanced
multiphoton ionization in the hydrogen molecular ion at infrared wavelengths [9, 10] but
at intensities such that dynamic effects of the ﬁeld cannot be neglected [11]. The well-
established Fourier-Floquet analysis [6, 12] is not particularly suitable for the study of
long-wavelength excitations as the number of frequency components required is very large.
Moreover, this approach supposes continuous wave conditions such that the state decays
exponentially from an isolated resonance state with a lifetime longer than the optical cycle
or natural orbital period. Conversely, long-wavelength pulses can be described by quasistatic
ﬁelds under the conditions such that γk ≪ 1. However, simple tunnelling formulae assume
exponential decay from a single isolated resonance connected adiabatically to the ﬁeld-free
state. This neglects nonadiabatic transitions within the well [7, 13] and rescattering of the
continuum electron [14, 15]. Given these difﬁculties, the direct solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation has distinct advantages. It is suited for all intensities and electronic states and all
wavelengths and pulse shapes. In particular it is capable of describing pulse-shape effects and
nonadiabatic transitions. Thus it is highly appropriate for realistic modelling of experiments
at infrared wavelengths such that γk ∼ 1.

Tunable Ti:Sapphire light λ ∼ 780 − 800 nm interacting with atomic hydrogen for
example, achieves the pure tunnelling regime, γk ≈ 0.1, only for intensities I > 1 × 1016W
cm−2, while for λ = 800 nm with I ∼ 3 × 1014W cm−2 [9], γk ∼ 0.7. Under these latter
conditions the ionization rate is well-deﬁned, however a static tunnelling model is unlikely
to give a correct estimate of the resonance positions and rates; we show that this is indeed
the case. In fact, the dynamic effects displace the critical distances, change the ionization
rates, and create electron excitation resonances. In the present work we solve the electronic
dynamics exactly by a direct solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE).
This does not include broadening due to the ﬁnite focal volume and the corrections due to
nuclear motion. Using atomic units, the ground state of the molecular ion is characterized
by a bond length Re = 2.0 and rotational constant Be = 1.36 × 10−4. If the laser pulse
duration is relatively short (∼ 20 fs compared with rotational timescale for this molecule
(Trot ∼ 1/Be ∼ 200 fs), then the laser-molecule interaction can be regarded as sudden in
comparison to the rotation of the system. Neglect of rotation effects is therefore reasonable. In
spite of these simpliﬁcations the results are very promising and in remarkably good agreement
with experiment for the ion energy spectrum. The indications are that appropriate reﬁnements
of the model would improve agreement, but this remains a goal for future work.

Making these approximations the TDSE, in atomic units, reads

This 2+1 dimensional TDSE can be discretized on an Nρ × Nz × Nt space-time grid. We
label the Nρ radial grid points by, {ρ1, ρ2, . . . ρi, . . . ρNρ}, while the Nz axial grid points
are denoted by, {z1, z2, . . . zj, . . . zNz }. The time evolution progresses through the sequence
of times {t1, t2, . . . tk, . . . tNt}.
In this case the wavefunction can be written as the array
φ(ρ, z, t) → φ(zi, ρj, tk). The method of discretization of the Hamiltonian divides the axial
and radial coordinates into subspaces. Two distinct but complementary grid methods are used
for the subspaces [16]. The radial subspace is discretized on a semi-inﬁnite range using a small
number Nρ of unevenly spaced points that are the nodes of global interpolating functions;
Lagrange meshes. This leads to a small dense matrix for the Hamiltonian in the ρ-subspace.
On the other hand the axial coordinate subspace is represented by a large number of equally-
spaced points, with spacing ∆z = 0.1 a.u., as lattice points of a ﬁnite-difference scheme.
The associated subspace Hamiltonian matrix is large but sparse. Our approach is tailored
to the requirements of accuracy and computational efﬁciency. This approach can easily be
parallelized to make use of massively parallel processors [14, 16]. At the very least, the
dimensions of the cylindrical box, height 2zmax radius ρmax, must be chosen to encompass
the tightly-bound states of the system. At the same time the box should be large enough to
allow the continuum states to evolve unfettered. As the wavefunction approaches the edge of
the box boundaries, we capture the photoelectrons by employing a masking function to absorb
the outgoing ﬂux [17]. The 2Σ+
g ground state is calculated via an iterative Lanzcos calculation
as described in [16].

The quasistatic nature of long-wavelength pulses (λ ∼ 1064 nm) means that it is fair to
compare the cycle-average static ﬁeld ionization rate with the time-dependent ionization rate
[7]. The dynamic-ﬁeld (wavelength-dependent) effects can be judged from ﬁgure 1 in which
we choose the wavelengths λ = 790nm and λ = 1064nm with the same average intensity
I = 1×1014 W cm−2 (E0 = 0.05338 a.u.). Firstly, for λ = 1064nm the cycle-averaged static
ﬁeld features [6, 7] are very similar to those found using our time-dependent method; with
two resonance peaks near R ∼ 5 a.u. and R ∼ 9 a.u. However, there are large differences
in the shape and relative heights of the peaks. The prominent resonance near R ∼ 9 a.u. is
the charge-resonance peak [13]. The inner peak (R ∼ 5 a.u.) is a feature of the potential
barrier. The longer wavelength λ = 1064 nm does give results very similar to the static cycle-
averaged results as expected [6]. For λ ∼ 790 nm, there is a signiﬁcant reduction in the heights
of these peaks and some indication of peak positions moving towards smaller internuclear
separations. Calculation at 390nm demonstrate that this trend in peak position moving to
smaller values of R is maintained with the ﬁrst peak found at R = 4 a.u. for this wavelength.
The resonance structure depends on both bond length and wavelength. It is interesting that as
the molecule separates into its atomic fragments, the wavelength dependence disappears and
the static ﬁeld result is valid. Figure 1 illustrates very clearly that molecular ﬁeld ionization
differs strongly from atomic ﬁeld ionization for the bond lengths, wavelengths and intensities
of interest. Indeed the molecular ionization rates only converge to within 5% of the atomic
rates at R = 20 a.u. For instance at a wavelength of 1064nm the molecular ionization rate
at R = 20 is 2.85 × 10−3 fs−1 compared with the atomic rate of 2.92 × 10−3 fs−1. These
atomic rates are calculated using the present code which takes R=0 and Z1 = Z2 = 1/2.
These atomic results are in agreement with other accurate time-dependent results [8] to within
0.5%. Our time-dependent results shown in ﬁgure 1 for λ = 1064 nm are consistent with
previous static ﬁeld cycle-averaged results [6, 7], although these results disagree with other
time-dependent results [5]. There are strong similarities in the R dependence of the rates
with those calculated previously. However our rates are up to 4 times higher than those of [5]
and the resonance positions are displaced to smaller R values, so that we predict faster ion
fragments with higher yields.

theoretical calculations (△).

We apply our model to simulate experiments [9] on the ion energy spectra from the
dissociative ionization of the hydrogen molecular ion using λ = 800 nm at I = 3.2×1014 W
cm−2; the results are presented in ﬁgure 2. In the experiment an H2 gas was ionized to form
the H+
2 ion target. The molecular ions subsequently dissociate and ionize in the laser ﬁeld,
with the proton fragments extracted and energy analyzed. By relating the kinetic energies
of the ions to the Coulomb explosion curve, ionization rates could be deduced for the range
of molecular bond lengths. The experimental conditions were such that saturation of the
ionization channel was avoided, permitting ion yields from larger R values to be estimated
and eliminating ion yields from the larger focal volume. Our approximation in assuming a
very localized high intensity region, smaller than the diffraction limit, is well justiﬁed. The
sensitivity of the ionization rate to changes in intensity and wavelength was noted in the results
presented in ﬁgure 1. Consider the changes in the ionization rates in going from the data
presented in ﬁgure 1 for λ = 790 nm to that for λ = 800 nm at an intensity 3.2 times higher,
in ﬁgure 2. The ionization rates in ﬁgure 2 are roughly 15 times higher which is consistent
with an exponential increase giving rise to more easily measurable ion yields. However the
double peak structure of ﬁgure 1 is now dominated by a single broad maximum near R ∼ 7. In
comparing with experiment we have in ﬁgure 2 normalized the laboratory data to our results.
We see that the shape of the theory and experimental curves are in remarkable agreement,
in spite of the assumptions made. The single broad peak is reproduced rather well, although
some additional structure present in the simulations is not resolved by experiment. For R > 8
the theory and experiment are in disagreement, and the theoretical estimate of ion yield from
R ∼ 9 is much lower than the experimental results. This might be attributed in part to the
variation in focal volume intensity. At the edges of the focal spot the intensities decrease
but the interaction volume is larger [1]. Moreover at lower intensities the ﬁeld ionization
rates move to larger R [6]. So one would expect that an inclusion of focal volume variation
would broaden the peak to larger values of R and partially compensate for this shortfall.
The second feature is that the theoretical results predict high ionization far in excess of that

Figure 3. Comparison of ionization rates from the present time-dependent calculations (△) at
λ=790 nm and I = 0.6 × 1014W cm−2 (E0 = 0.041 a.u.) with static ﬁeld cycle-average

found experimentally at large R. The R → ∞ atomic limit of the theory results is very
accurately known and consistent with the theoretical results in ﬁgure 2. The theoretical data
for ionization rates can be considered as accurate. However the lower ion yield observed
can be explained by the fact that during molecular dissociation the molecular ion can ionize
at smaller R values. If the ionization rates are large at small R, then few if any molecules
can survive to be ionized at large bond lengths. A rough estimate of the survival probability
P (R) of the molecular ion can be found from the classical dynamics of the ionized molecular
ion. The depletion rate is given by dP/dR ≈ −(Γ/v)P where v(R) is the classical relative
velocity of the protons such that mpv2/4 + Z1Z2/R = Z1Z2/Re and mp is the proton mass.
For the case λ = 800 nm and I = 3.2 × 1014 Wcm−2 a rough estimate based on this model
gives P ≈ 0.2 at R = 14. This is only an indication of the effect but it is consistent with the
ﬁndings of Dundas [15].

Very recently data have become available from experiments in Garching on H+
2 for
λ = 790nm at intensities just above the Coulomb explosion threshold, namely I = 0.6×1014
W cm−2 [18]. In these results the ﬁrst observations of vibrationally resolved structure has
been obtained. From the ion momentum distribution, it was suggested that a critical distance
around R = 12 could explain the results. Existing static ﬁeld cycle-average rates at a
comparable intensity I = 0.56 × 1014W cm−2, E0 = 0.04 a.u. [6] are shown in ﬁgure 3.
These results conﬁrm that the ionization rates are extremely small, the reduction in intensity
by a factor of 5 leading to ion yields roughly one hundred times smaller. The double peak
structure emerges in our calculations, and since the rates are now reduced, the bulk of the
molecules will reach the outer resonance position. In ﬁgure 3 the time-dependent calculations
for λ=790 nm and I = 0.6 × 1014W cm−2 are in fairly good agreement with the static ﬁeld
results. However we note (ﬁgure 3) the inner peak R ∼ 6 − 8 is broad and high and ought
to produce ion yields comparable to the sharp outer peak near R = 11. The observation
of quantal vibrational structure in the ion spectrum means that a full quantum treatment of
nuclear dynamics is required to analyze these new experiments in full.

We have solved the full-dimensional TDSE for the electron dynamics of H+

polarized laser ﬁelds, assuming that the nuclei are ﬁxed in space. The method employed
is highly accurate and can be efﬁciently implemented on parallel processing computers.
Ionization rates can be calculated for all nuclear separations and for wavelengths from the
infrared to x-ray, for a range of laser pulses. Comparison of our results with other theoretical
calculations and recent experimental measurements show very good agreement. We have
been able to identify and calculate dynamic tunnelling resonances for λ = 790 nm and
λ = 800 nm and obtain accurate estimates of the ionization rates and large dynamic tunnelling
corrections are observed. A major simpliﬁcation in the model is the ﬁxed-nuclei assumption.
However, our results for λ = 800 nm and I = 3.2 × 1014 W cm−2 reproduce the measured
dependence of ionization rate on bond length. At shorter wavelength and lower intensities,
λ = 790 nm and I = 0.6 × 1014 W cm−2, our results indicate a double peak structure
in the ionization rate as the bond length varies. The outer ionization resonance agrees with
experimental measurements [18].

To model the experiments more realistically several extensions to the current approach
are required. Firstly, the energy and angular momentum exchanges between the nuclei and
electrons will occur during process. Dundas [15] has combined the full electronic dynamics
with a quantal vibrational motion for intense ﬁeld dissociative ionization and found that the
dynamic tunnelling resonances dominate strongly over pure dissociation at high intensities.
A classical model of nuclear motion will not be sufﬁcient as the wavepacket will disperse
during the process and indeed experiments are now able to resolve the vibrational structure in
the ion yield [18]. The quantal motion is essential to obtain an ion spectrum distribution rather
than one-to-one mapping of ion energies to speciﬁc bond lengths. Secondly, within the laser
focal spot, there is a spatial variation of intensity which has to be taken into account above
the saturation intensity. Thirdly, while present calculations only consider parallel electronic
transitions, we must consider results averaged over molecular orientation. Previous work by
Plummer and McCann [12] found that DC ionization rates decrease sharply as the angle of
orientation of the the molecular axis with the ﬁeld increases. The orientation dependence of
dynamic tunnelling ionization has yet to be established. These reﬁnements are likely to be
more important in the very high intensity regime I ∼ 1015 W cm−2 rather than the regime
I ∼ 1014 W cm−2. We intend to undertake reﬁnements of our model to simulate these effects
and produce accurate estimates of ion yields and ion energy spectra.

Computer simulation of coherent interaction of charged particles and photons with
crystalline solids at high energies

Armen Apyan∗
Northwestern University, Department of Physics and Astronomy, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA

Monte Carlo simulation code has been developed and tested for studying the passage of charged
particle beams and radiation through the crystalline matter at the energies from tens of MeV up to
hundreds of GeV. The developed Monte Carlo code simulates electron, positron and photon shower
in single crystals and amorphous media. The Monte Carlo code tracks the all generations of charged
particles and photons through the aligned crystal by taking into account the parameters of incoming
beam, multiple scattering, energy loss, emission angles, transverse dimension of beams, and linear
polarization of produced photons.

The simulation results are compared with the CERN-NA-59 experimental data. The realistic
descriptions of the electron and photon beams and the physical processes within the silicon and
germanium single crystals have been implemented.

INTRODUCTION

In the last decade, the electromagnetic interaction of
charged particles and photons with crystalline and amor-
phous media are intensively investigated both theoreti-
cally and experimentally. Special attention was given to
the investigation of interaction of charged particles and
photons with crystalline media. An electron or photon
impinging on a crystal will interact coherently with the
atoms in aligned crystal axes or planes. If the Laue con-
dition is satisﬁed, the coherent bremsstrahlung (CB) or
coherent pair production (CPP) phenomena are mani-
fested [1]. The essential characteristics of the phenom-
ena are quasi-monochromatic spectrum, high intensity
and linear polarization degree of radiation in coherent
maximum. The intensity of the coherent bremsstrahlung
in aligned crystals is few ten times greater than in amor-
phous media at the certain energy region. The same
characteristics are seen in CPP by photons in the single
crystals. The processes of CB and CPP in single crys-
tals are well investigated and understood both theoreti-
cally [1] and experimentally [2, 3].

In this work we describe brieﬂy the physical processes
involved, the simulation model and the results of the
Monte Carlo simulations for high energy particles travers-
ing an aligned single crystals.

It is well known that the dominant energy loss mecha-
nism for high energy electrons and positrons is the pro-
duction of electromagnetic radiation, i.e. bremsstrahlung
for motion through the matter. The high energy photons
become absorbed mainly due to the e+e− pair produc-
tion in a matter. This is true for crystals as well.
In
our simulations we ignored the processes such as Comp-
ton scattering, photoeﬀect, energy loss in ionization, nu-
clear processes due to smallness of their cross section and

negligible contribution in total cross section. Electron
or photon beams penetrating the crystal will create an
electromagnetic shower (EMS) via the CB, CPP or inco-
herent bremsstrahlung (ICB) and pair production (IPP)
depending on the orientation of crystal axes and planes
relative to incident particle momentum.

There are broad experimental and theoretical inves-
tigations devoted to the EMS development in various
amorphous media and energies. Many general - purpose
Monte Carlo simulation packages (see Ref. [4] and refer-
ences cited therein) for transport of particles and radi-
ation through the amorphous media are developed and
have been successfully used in the last decades.

The electromagnetic interaction processes in aligned
crystals are more complicated than in amorphous media.
The cross section of interaction strongly depends on the
crystal type, its orientations as well as on the energy,
angular distribution and polarization of initial photon or
electron beams.

The EMS in single crystals was mainly considered in
channeling regime, when electrons and photons penetrate
the crystal along a direction close to the one of main
crystallographic axes [5, 6]. We consider EMS in single
crystals oriented in CB mode. All the above mentioned
peculiarities of coherent processes are carefully taken into
account in Monte Carlo computer code.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

Diﬀerential cross section of coherent radiation in a
crystal is composed of two terms [1] coherent and in-
coherent bremsstrahlung

dσ = dσinc + dσcoh

(1)

The ﬁrst term corresponds to the incoherent cross sec-
tion (including radiation in the ﬁeld of the atomic nu-
cleus and electrons) on N independent atoms. The sec-

2

ond one corresponds to the coherent radiation cross sec-
tion. Let us denote (E0, P0), (E1, P1) and (Eγ, Pγ) as
the energy and momentum of incoming, outgoing elec-
trons and emitted photon, respectively. The initial beam
orientation with respect to the crystal axes is deﬁned by
two angles in the following manner. The three chosen or-
thogonal axes of cubic crystal are [b1 b2 b3]. The initial
beam orientation is deﬁned by the angle θ0 between the
initial electron momentum P0 and crystal axis b3 and by
the angle ψ0 between the electron momentum and crys-
tal plane (b1 b3). Let θ and ϕ be the emitted photon
polar and azimuthal angles with respect to the direction

of initial motion of the electron. Usually the polar angle
is presented in the units of mc2/Ein:

u =

Ein
mc2 θ

where Ein is the energy of initial particle, m is the elec-
tron rest mass and c is speed of light.

The angular-spectral distribution of CB (after integra-
tion with respect to exit angles of electrons) is given by
the following expressions [1]:

The above described parameters are the same as for

Computed diﬀerential cross sections of CB (Eq. 3 in-
tegrated over the emitted photon angles (θ, ϕ) and
CPP (Eq. 12 integrated over the production angles (θ±,
ϕ±) of e+e− pairs) are given in Fig. 1.

Top ﬁgure represents the spectral distribution of CB
depending on the photon energy, x = Eγ/E0, on the Si
and Ge single crystals. For an E0 = 178.2GeV electron
beam making an angle of θ0 = 30 mrad from the <001>
crystallographic axis and ψ0 = 180µrad from the (110)
plane of Si crystal, the maximum peak intensity occurs
in the vicinity of 100 GeV as seen in Fig. 1. The angle
ψ0 = 187µrad was chosen for the corresponding spectral
distribution in case of Ge crystal.

The diﬀerential cross sections of CPP in Si and Ge
single crystals are given in the bottom of Fig. 1 depending
on the energy of the e+e− pair component, y = E±/Eγ.
The total cross section of CPP has a maximum value
for the chosen primary photon energy Eγ = 178.2GeV
and orientation angles θ0 = 30 mrad from the <001>
crystallographic axis and ψ0 = 0.6mrad from the (110)
plane.

Particles could undergo to small angles with respect
to the crystal axes and planes due to angular divergence
and multiple scattering during the EMS development in

crystal. CB and CPP processes have strong angular and
energy dependences and the validity conditions of the
Born approximation no longer hold at very high energies
and small incidence angles with respect to the crystal
axes and planes. The onset of this problem for the de-
scription of radiation emission and pair production has
the characteristic angle θv = U0/mc2 [10], where U0 is
the plane potential well depth. The CB and CPP theory
may be applied for the incidence angles with respect to
the crystal axes/planes θ ≫ θv. The general theory of
radiation and pair production is used [10, 11] for incident
angles θ ∼ θv and θ < θv.

III. MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS

A. General Considerations

Monte Carlo simulation technique of EMS develop-
ment in oriented single crystals is based on the coherent
radiation and coherent e+e− pair production processes at
high energies. The program includes the formulae of co-
herent and quasiclassical theories for radiation and pair
production. The program calculated the cross sections
directly using the formulae of coherent eﬀects (Eqs. 3
and 12). The quasiclassiacl theory was applied for calcu-
lating the cross sections in case of small incident angles
with respect to the crystal axes or planes. Direct calcula-
tions by the formulae of this theory takes large computer
time. Because the computer time needed to perform all
the simulations is formidable, we used a data bank of pre-
calculated cross sections of radiation and pair produc-
tion to save the computer time. The data bank contains
the total and diﬀerential cross sections on dependence of
crystal type and its orientation, energy, horizontal and
vertical angles and polarization. The cross sections for
certain energy, angles, polarization were found by inter-
polation of the numerical values of cross sections stored

diﬀer from calculated values ∼ 2 − 3%. We ﬁnd that our
approach yields very accurate numerical results for the-
ory and resulting in a further saving of computer time.

B. Simulation model

The simulation model used in this work is based on
random walk or particle history, where a history corre-
sponds to following a particle from entering the medium,
interacting and leaving it. Each particle history i can
be represented by the array Si
j [12] denoting the state of
particle before jth interaction:

j =

j, ηi

(cid:0)

ton position, direction, polarization, energy and charge
before each interaction act, respectively.

j, qi
j)

j, Ei

j, Ωi

j, Ei

j, ηi

(15)

The initial particles, electrons or photons, generate two
secondaries after each interaction. Initial electron loses
energy via bremsstrahlung and produces secondary elec-
tron and bremsstrahlung photon. Electron can produce
several number of photons during the traveling through

4

matter. The number of produced photons depend on
the thickness of the crystalline target and its orientation.
The initial photon is transformed into the e+e− pair after
interaction. The simulation code calculates new state of
particles and state of produced particles after each inter-
action act. A history is terminated when particle energy
drops below a low energy cut-oﬀ, or when particle moves
outside to the target.

The similar simpliﬁed Monte Carlo simulation model
was employed in [13, 14]. The simulation procedure
has been improved by taking into account the pecu-
liarities of the emission angles of photons and electrons
in case of coherent eﬀects (see Eq. 5). This improve-
ment gives possibility to use the code for simulation of
production of collimated photon beams from thin crys-
tals (∼ 20 − 100µm) [15]. Polarization dependent cross
sections and transverse dimensions of the particles beams
are also implemented in the code.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Comparison with experiment

Series of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for
prediction of the results of CERN NA59 experiment. The
goal of the experiment was the production of linearly po-
larized photon beams and conversion of the linear po-
larization into circular with the help of oriented single
crystals [2, 3, 16, 17, 18].

experimental data are given in Fig. 2. The top ﬁgure rep-
resent the simulated and measured total radiated energy
for 1.5 cm thick unaligned silicon crystal. Desoriented
silicon crystal acts as an amorphous medium, hence we
have incoherent bremsstrahlung spectra.

The bottom ﬁgure represents the simulated and mea-
sured CB spectra for the two orientations of silicon crys-
tal with respect to incident electron beam. The electron
beam was incident an angle of θ0 = 5mrad to axis <100>
for both settings of silicon crystal. For the upper curve
the electron momentum makes an angle of ψ0 = 70µrad
with respect to the (110) plane and ψ0 = 180µrad for
lower curve.

The experimental data are taken from [3, 18]. The
prominent agreement between the results of simulation
and experimental data is seen. The described Monte
Carlo simulation code allowed to predict the photon spec-
tra, linear and circular polarizations, optimal orientation
and thickness of used crystals.

B. Electromagnetic shower

The developed code is capable to track the all gener-
ations or histories of electrons and photons in crystal.
Thus, it can be used for simulation of EMS develop-
ment in single crystals oriented in CB mode. We con-
sidered EMS initiated by the high energy electrons and
photons in oriented silicon and germanium single crys-
tals. The incident electron and photon beams parame-
ters (energy, orientation angles, angular spread) are iden-
tical with those in NA59 experiment and discussed above
(Section II and Fig. 1).

All calculations are carried out for the energy of ini-
tial particles (electrons or photons) of 178.2 GeV. The
simulations takes into account the initial electron beam
angular divergence in both horizontal (48µrad) and ver-
tical (33µrad) planes. The types of single crystals and
their orientations used in Monte Carlo simulations are
presented in Table I. A low energy cut-oﬀ of 5 GeV was
placed on the production of all secondary particles. In
this study no distinction is made between electrons and
positrons (later on simply electrons).

Important quantities in EMS development in matter
are the radiation length (LR) for charged particles and
absorption length (LA) for photons. There is a weak de-
pendence of these quantities on particle energy in amor-

5

phous media. Practically LR and LA are constant for
given amorphous material. There is a strong dependence
of LR and LA on crystal type, its orientation, particle en-
ergy and polarization in case of oriented single crystals.
The corresponding radiation and absorption lengths for
aligned and unaligned crystals (in parenthesis) are given
in Table I. One can see a large reduction of LR and LA
in case of aligned crystals in comparison with amorphous
media.

Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 represent the Monte Carlo simula-
tion results of longitudinal EMS development in silicon
and germanium single crystals in energy range 5 GeV <
E < 175 GeV . The energy carried by EMS is shown on
the top ﬁgures in dependence of radiation and absorp-
tion lengths. The bottom ﬁgures show the dependence of
number of particles on radiation and absorption lengths.

tron, respectively, for both crystals. The energy carried
by the photon component of EMS are larger than the
energy of electrons as seen from the ﬁgures.

FIG. 4: The energy (top) and number of particles (bottom)
of EMS as a function of thickness of an aligned germanium
single crystal. The notations are the same as for Fig. 3.

This is true for number of photons as well, which is
about 2 times larger than the number of electrons. This
is explained by the CB mechanism of radiation. Initial
electrons lose large amount of energy around 100 GeV
due the CB radiation and produce high energy photons
as seen from Fig. 5. Simulated photon (top) and elec-
tron (bottom) spectra, Ed2N/dEdLR, per unit of radia-
tion length for a silicon crystal are shown. The solid lines
represent the spectra from aligned crystal and the dashed
lines for unaligned crystal acted as an amorphous. The
photon spectrum for ICB is smoothly decreases with in-
creasing of photon energy. One can observe an expressed
photon peak in the vicinity of 100 GeV in case of CB
spectrum.
Initial electron loses energy mainly for pro-
ducing high energy photons. Thus, the huge amount
of energy is concentrated in the high energy region of
the photon spectrum. This concentration of energy leads
to the ”delay” of EMS development. For example, the

FIG. 5: Simulated photon (top) and electron (bottom) spec-
tra, per unit of radiation length for a silicon crystal. The
solid curves represent the spectra from aligned crystal and
the dashed curves for unaligned crystal acted as amorphous.

amorphous matter or crystal oriented in channeling set-
tings split the energy of electrons very eﬀectively and
EMS develops more intensively [6].

The energy carried by the electron component of
EMS (initiated by photons) reaches its maximum value
at ∼ 1.5 LA for both crystals as seen from the Fig. 3 and
Fig. 4. The number of electrons reaches the maximum
value at ∼ 3. LA. The energy carried by the photon com-
ponent of EMS are approximately the same as energy of
electrons at their maximum values. But the number of
photons is about 60% larger than number of electrons at
LA > 3. The behavior of the EMS initiated by photons
is approximately the same as in case of EMS initiated by
electrons. The large number of electron-positron pairs
are produced in the vicinity of 90 GeV due to the CPP.

V. CONCLUSION

The computer package presented in this paper is in-
tended for Monte Carlo simulation of the electron and
photon beams propagation through the oriented single
crystals and amorphous media at high energies. The
agreement between the simulation results and measure-
ments is seen to be satisfactory. After ﬁnishing the pro-

gram, the following parameters of the photons and elec-
trons are reported: energy, angular and spatial distribu-
tions and polarization of passed electrons and photons.
The important step in the code is the simulation of the
photon radiation and e+e− pair production angles, which
strongly depends on the initial particles energy. This fea-
ture of the computer code can be used for simulation of
the photon beam collimation.

The longitudinal behavior of electron and photon in-
duced EMS in single crystals oriented in CB and CPP
mode in the energy range between 5 GeV and 175 GeV
was investigated. The interesting results are obtained
concerning EMS development in single crystals aligned
in CB or CPP mode. The crystal does not split the en-

7

ergy of particles as amorphous media. It concentrates the
energy of radiation and produced e+e− pairs in the high
energy region after the ﬁrst interaction act. The crys-
tals behave as a capacitor of energy up to a thickness of
∼ 2LR/A. As a result the ”delayed” EMS take place in
the crystal.

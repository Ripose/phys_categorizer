Abstract

The paper is devoted to the generalized wall functions of Robin–type and their
application to near–wall turbulent ﬂows. The wall functions are based on the trans-
fer of a boundary condition from a wall to some intermediate boundary near the
wall. The boundary conditions on the intermediate boundary are of Robin–type
and represented in a diﬀerential form. The wall functions are formulated in an
analytical easy–to–implement form, can take into account the source terms of the
momentum equation, and do not include free parameters. The log–proﬁle assump-
tion is not used in this approach. A robust numerical algorithm is proposed for
implementation of Robin–type wall functions to both ﬁnite–diﬀerence and ﬁnite–
volume numerical schemes. The algorithm of implementation of the Robin–type
wall functions to existing ﬁnite-volume codes is provided. The axisymmetric im-
pinging jet problem is numerically investigated for diﬀerent regimes on the base of
the wall-functions implemented to the high-Reynolds-number k

ǫ model.

1 Introduction

Problems related with turbulent near wall ﬂows appear in many industrial applications.

of the wall, there is a thin sublayer with predominantly molecular diﬀusion and viscous
dissipation. The sublayer has a substantial inﬂuence upon the remaining part of the ﬂow.
An adequate resolution of a solution in the sublayer requires a very ﬁne mesh because
of the thinness of the sublayer and high gradients of the solution. It makes the model
to be time consuming and often it is not suitable for real design. Because of the low
turbulent Reynolds number in the sublayer, the models that resolve the sublayer are
called low-Reynolds-number (LR) models.

In turn, the high-Reynolds-number (HR) models do not resolve the viscous sublayer. It
signiﬁcantly saves computational eﬀorts [1,2]. In the HR models, the boundary conditions
or near-wall proﬁles are represented by wall functions. The wall functions usually are semi-
empirical and have very limited applications [1–5]. First wall functions are based on the
log-law proﬁle assumption for the velocity [4, 5]. In addition, their formal extension to
complex ﬂows demands time-consuming iterations for calculating the skin friction included
in the log-law proﬁle. A substantial disadvantage of these wall functions is a strong
dependence on the near wall mesh used. This problem is especially pronounced if the
ﬁrst mesh point is located inside the viscous sublayer. To avoid this, the scalable wall
functions are suggested in [6]. Wilcox assumes [7] that the pressure gradient must be taken
into account to avoid the mesh dependence. Yet, the recently suggested adaptive wall

1

functions [8] overcome this limitation by using look-up tables for turbulent quantatives
and skin friction.

In more recent wall functions [1–3, 9, 10] source terms, such as the pressure gradient,
might be taken into account. The numerical comparisons done in [1–3, 10] showed that
such advanced wall functions give substantially better prediction than the standard wall
functions. In [3,10], the analytical wall functions are obtained by approximate integrating
boundary-layer-type equations in the wall vicinity using the assumption that all terms
besides the diﬀusive one are constant. At the wall, the boundary conditions are the same
as those used in the LR models. An analytical proﬁle for the turbulent viscosity are then
used in the cell nearest to the wall to reconstruct the near-wall solution. The wall functions
for the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation are based on the local analytical
solution for the velocity in the near-wall cell. In computations, the numerical ﬂux to the
wall is taken from the previous iteration as it is performed in the case of the standard
wall functions. Although approaches [1–3, 9, 10] allow one to make substantially better
prediction in comparison to the standard methods, their realization seems to be quite
complicated. The wall functions [1–3,9,10] are only represented in a ﬁnite-diﬀerence form.
Although this form is suitable for ﬁnite-volume algorithms, its use for ﬁnite-diﬀerence
approximations is not clear. Similar to the standard wall functions, this approach faces
substantial problems if the nearest to the wall cell is in the viscous sublayer. Also, it is
important to note that the second to the wall cell cannot be much smaller or bigger than
the ﬁrst one because of the integration over the ﬁrst cell.

The method of boundary condition transfer is suggested in [13, 14]. The method al-
lows us to transfer a boundary condition from the wall to some intermediate surface. The
boundary condition is transfered either approximately (analytically) or exactly (numeri-
cally). The boundary conditions on the intermediate surface are always of Robin–type (or
mixed type) and represented in a diﬀerential, mesh independent, form. These boundary
conditions are set on both a function and its normal derivative. Therefore, their real-
ization does not require additional iterations between, for example, the velocity and skin
friction. This brings an additional robustness to the algorithm of their implementation.
These boundary conditions are interpreted as generalized (Robin–type) wall functions.
Another advantage of these wall functions is related with their universal formulation for
all dependent variables.

The Robin–type wall functions take into account the inﬂuence of the source terms in
governing equations. The location of the point, to which the boundary conditions are
transferred, does not make any considerable eﬀect on the mesh distribution nearby this
point. The wall functions can be implemented in both ﬁnite-diﬀerence and ﬁnite-volume
approximations. It is shown how the wall functions can be implemented in existing codes.
Preliminary tests for channel ﬂow [15] and impinging jet [14] have shown promising results

functions [3, 10], the key advantages of the Robin–type wall functions are related with
their robust implementation and universal diﬀerential formulation.

In the paper below the Robin–type wall functions are implemented in the k

ǫ model
and applied for the axisymmetric impinging jet problem. The computational results are
compared against available experimental data. Implementation of the wall functions to
both ﬁnite-volume and ﬁnite-diﬀerence schemes are discussed.

2 Generalized (Robin–type) wall functions

In order to formulate the Robin–type wall functions, ﬁrst let us record the governing
equations in the following general form:

with Dirichlet boundary condition on the left-hand side:

(µuy)y = Rh

u (0) = u0

Equation (1) represents the general form of the boundary-layer-type equation. The
right-hand side Rh is an appropriate source term including, e.g., the pressure gradient in
the momentum equation.

If the right-hand side Rh = const, then the Robin–type wall functions are formulated

as follows [13, 14]:

u(y∗) = u0 + f1

Relation (3) can be interpreted as a boundary condition of Robin–type transferred
from a wall (y = 0) to some point y∗. This boundary condition can be either exact (if
the exact function of µ is used in (4)) or approximate (if µ is estimated by one way or
another). One should emphasize that the Robin–type boundary condition is set for both
a function and its derivative.
It is easy to see that the mesh distribution nearby the
point y∗ can be independently chosen on the location of this point. Implementation of
Robin–type conditions to both ﬁnite–diﬀerence and ﬁnite–volume schemes are considered
below.

In the general case Rh = Rh(y), we have

The method of boundary condition transfer technique can be used to derive the wall
functions for the tangential and normal velocity components U and V , temperature T ,
and turbulent kinetic energy k.

Having neglected diﬀusion parallel to the wall, the momentum and enthalpy transport

equations can be written in the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y) as follows:

Here µl and µt are the laminar and turbulent viscosities, accordingly; P r and P rt are
Prandtl numbers; U and V are the velocity component in the (x, y) coordinate system; ρ
is the density; P is the pressure.

The intermediate boundary conditions for U, V and T at point y∗ are given by (5)
upon substitution U, V or T instead of u accordingly. Evidently, the coeﬃcient µ in (1)
must be considered as either µl + µt or µl/P r + µt/P rt. In the case of the momentum
equation u0 = 0. If y∗ is chosen in the vicinity of the wall, the right-hand side Rh can be
simply evaluated at y∗. Thus, in the case of the momentum equations and enthalpy the
relative right-hand sides are as follows:

Thus, all the terms of the parabolized (reduced) Navier-Stokes equations (PNS) [16] are
taken into account. It worth noting that in the boundary condition (3) for the normal
velocity it is not assumed to be zero. Thus, these wall functions do not have direct
restrictions to their exploration in modeling separated ﬂows.

It has been found from the computations that it is more accurate to evaluate the

rather than from equation (20).

If y∗ < yv, then the boundary conditions are set inside the sublayer, and formulas (7)
are not formally valid. It is suggested to pose the boundary conditions at the edge of the
sublayer y = yv as in [6] because yv is small enough. Then, the coeﬃcients f1 and f2 in
(5) can be evaluated as follows:

f1 = αµyv,

f2 = αµy2

v/2.

It is then assumed that the turbulent viscosity µt reaches value (21) at the edge of the
viscous sublayer immediately. These boundary conditions are consistent with boundary
conditions (7) taking in the limit y∗

The wall function for the turbulent energy k is used in form (5), (6) and depends
on the right-hand side Rhk(y) represented by equality (16). It includes the dissipation ǫ
and derivative dU/dy. The former term is taken from (24) while the latter term can be
evaluated in the interval [0, y∗] from the reduced momentum equation (9), (12):

(cid:17)

(µl + µt)dU/dy = [(µl + µ∗t )U(y∗) + f2Rhu] /f1 + (y

(25)

−

where the turbulent viscosity µt is deﬁned by (17). Equation (25) is obtained by the
integration of equation (9) and use relation (3) to exclude dU/dy(y∗). Thus, this equation
relies on the PNS assumptions used.

To evaluate yv from (22), it is possible to use the value k∗ instead of kv. It allows us
to simplify the evaluation algorithm for yv substantially. First, a similar opportunity was
noticed in [3]. The estimation of Rev is varied between 10.8 and 20 [3,18]. It corresponds
to the interval between the upper limit of the viscous sublayer and the point at which the
linear and logarithmic parts of the velocity proﬁle intersect for the channel ﬂow [19]. It
is not clear which value in this interval is most appropriate to approximation (17). In all
computational results given below, Rev = 12.

It worth noting that the coeﬃcients f1 and f2 in wall functions (3)–(7) depend only
on y∗ and k∗. The latter value is determined from the solution of the HR model at the
boundary point y∗. Hence, the intermediate boundary conditions (5) at y = y∗ complete
the boundary-value problem in the interval [y∗, ye] and can be considered as generalized
wall functions. These boundary conditions are of Robin–type and similar to the ”slip
boundary condition” at the edge of the Knudsen–layer in aerodynamics. One should note
that the boundary conditions are linear with respect to the leading variable. As it follows
from (3) and (5), the source terms in the wall functions can only be essential far enough
from the wall because of the quadratic dependence of f2 on y∗.

The HR solution obtained in [y∗, ye] can be extended to interval [yv, y∗] using the

6

analytical solution in this interval:

u(y) = u(0) + φ1(y)u∗y −

Thus, the intermediate boundary is not necessarily to be related to the nearest to the

It worth noting that, although the problem is solved in the bulk domain [y∗, ye] only,
the ﬂux to the wall (e.g., skin friction) can be easily evaluated considering (8) (or its
analogy for the temperature in the case of heat ﬂux).

Thus, the developed wall functions can be applied to all dependent variables but ǫ in
a uniform manner. It is possible to show that the coeﬃcients f1 and f2 can be determined
analytically even in the case of the turbulent kinetic energy k. This fact can be useful
for saving computer resources. For engineering purposes it worth considering a simpliﬁed
version of the wall functions corresponding to f2 = 0. Since the coeﬃcient f1 can be
chosen to be the same for all variables, the wall functions become fully identical in this
case.

The generalized Robin–type wall functions are not based on a numerical approxima-
tion in the inner region [0, y∗], as in [1–3, 10], therefore the location of the intermediate
boundary is not very substantial for the mesh distribution in the bulk domain. It means
we can choose, e.g., a ﬁne mesh despite a relatively big value of y∗ (or vice versa) without
loose of stability.

In this paper we make the main focus on the analytical evaluation of the coeﬃcients
f1 and f2 in (3). Yet, the coeﬃcients can be evaluated numerically by integrating LR
equations in the interval 0, y∗. It may lead to the decomposition method [13, 14]. Also,
this approach can be naturally integrated in the numerical wall-functions [2, 9].

3 Numerical implementation of Robin–type wall functions

The Robin–type wall functions can be implemented to both ﬁnite–diﬀerence and ﬁnite–
volume RANS approximations. In this section, some aspects of their robust implementa-
tion are considered.

A general remark related with robust implementation is as follows. Boundary condi-
tions of Robin–type are set on both a function and its derivative. Upon approximating the
derivative, both terms should be considered at the same iteration (or time step). Taking
into account one of the terms from a previous iteration leads to additional iterations, at
least. It is easy to see this property in the case of a linear equation. Only simultaneous
consideration of both terms provides an iterationless solution.

The boundary condition is represented by (5) for any y∗ in the vicinity of the wall
even if y∗ vanishes. This boundary condition fully replaces the original boundary condition
u(0) = u0.

7

In numerical simulation of turbulence, the ﬁnite–diﬀerence numerical schemes pre-
serving positiveness of a solution [17] are very eﬃcient because unknown variables such
as the turbulent kinetic energy k or its dissipation ǫ must be positive. The following
numerical procedure can be used for developing the positive deﬁnite schemes in solving
boundary-value problems with Robin–type boundary conditions [14].

Boundary condition (5) can be rewritten in the following general form:

k(0) = αdk/dy(0) + β,

(27)

assuming that both the function k and its derivative dk/dy are positive. This assumption
is valid in the case of real physical problems for the turbulent kinetic energy in the wall
vicinity. The coeﬃcient α is positive because f1 is always positive but the coeﬃcient β
can be negative (mostly, where ǫ > Pk). In computations it can lead to a negative value
of k. To avoid such a case, it is suggested to rewrite (27) in the following form if β < 0:

k(0) = αdk/dy(0) + β

k(0)
k−(0)

or

where ˜α =

−

k(0) = ˜αdk/dy(0),

(28)

β/k−(0) and k−(0) is the value of k(0) taken from the previous either time

At last one should note that at some distance from the wall the derivative dk/dy
becomes negative. Yet, in this area the function β is positive (Pk > ǫ) and, therefore,
there are no principal diﬃculties in reaching a positive solution.

Though Robin–type boundary condition (5) can be set at the wall, its implementation
to existing codes based on ﬁnite–volume schemes is more easy in the following treatment.
Assume that unknown variables are deﬁned at the centers of cells. For the sake of sim-
plicity let us consider 1D approximation in the normal to the wall direction. It is enough
to consider approximation at the nearest to the wall cell since the rest approximation is
remained without any modiﬁcation. Let us denote values at the centre of the cell by index
1/2 and values at the edge, opposite to the wall, by index 1. Then, considering y∗ = y1/2
we have a relation in the following form:

where ˜f2 =

Equation (30) represents the approximation of the governing equation in the near-wall

This kind of approximation is used for all variables, but ǫ, including k. In the last case,
the right-hand side is rapidly changed and the integral in the right-hand side must be
evaluated accurately enough.
It can be easily done either numerically or analytically
using the analytical expression for the velocity gradient (25).

If y∗ > yv, the considered above approximation is close to the approximation based on
the analytical wall functions (AWF) [3]. The principal diﬀerence is related with robust-
ness. In the case of the Robin–type wall functions both the function and its derivative
(ﬂux) are simultaneously taken into account while in realization of the AWF the ﬂux is
calculated in iterations. This diﬀerence becomes more clear in the case of a linear equa-
tion. Then, the Robin–type formulation of the boundary conditions does not require any
iterations.

At last, a brief comment can be done with regard to a staggered mesh. In this approach
the velocity is deﬁned at the vertexes of a cell. In our consideration this means u1 is known
instead of u1/2. In this case, the simplest way to remain the uniform approach is based
on the Taylor expansion:

u1 = u1/2 + y1/2

This yields a required relation between u1/2 and u1 since the ﬁrst derivative takes place
in (29) and the second derivative can be evaluated via the right-hand side Rh. Thus, the
ﬂux at the nearest to the wall cell is as follows:

4 Impinging jet

−

The problem of impinging jet appears in many industrial applications related with ei-
ther heating or cooling processes. The heat transfer problem on a turbulent circular jet
impinging onto a ﬂat is well studied experimentally [11, 20–22]. Therefore, it became a
widespread test case for diﬀerent turbulent models including the LR [12, 24–28] and HR
k

ǫ models [6, 9, 24, 29].
The problem is formulated as follows. A fully turbulent air jet, generated in a pipelike
nozzle, impinges on a ﬂat surface at the right angle. The Reynolds number, based on
the nozzle diameter D and the bulk velocity, equals to Re = 23000 and Re = 70000.
The distance L between the nozzle and the surface is varied between 2D and 14D. Air
is treated as an ideal gas and considered under normal conditions at temperature 293K.
The heated surface has constant temperature Tw = 314.9K.

The computational domain spans 13D in the radial direction. The grid includes
150x100 (axial x radial) nodes and 150x200 nodes. For the validation purposes, pre-
liminary comparisons of the results obtained on diﬀerent meshes were done to check grid
sensitivity. The boundary conditions at the edge of the nozzle are speciﬁed using the
proﬁles for a fully developed turbulent pipe ﬂow. The computations of the local Nusselt

9

number are done for the diﬀerent values of y∗ or Rey∗
stagnation point.

ergy in the stagnation point region by an order of magnitude [29]. It inevitably leads to
the considerable overestimation of the heat ﬂux. As a result, the linear LR k
ǫ models
give unacceptable overprediction by a factor of two, even more [2, 26–28]. Furthermore,
the linear k
ǫ model, as well as other EVM, is not entirely justiﬁed around the stagna-
tion point because of the anisotropy of the ﬂow. To improve prediction, along with the
non-linear EVM, some modiﬁcations of the EVM are used including the implementation
of a realizability constraint [28], introduction of empirical formulas for the Prandtl num-
ber [26] and heat ﬂux [6]. The application of the wall functions, in most cases, is also
showed a poor performance [2, 24, 29]. More or less reasonable prediction was achieved
in [2] using the Chieng – Launder wall function [30] and the scalable wall functions [6]. It
is to be noted that in the latter case the empirical correlation was used for the local heat
ﬂux. The generalized wall functions were applied in [14] to simulation of the impinging
jet at Re = 23000 with L/D = 2 and L/D = 6. Apart from the heat ﬂux, the prediction
of the wall friction is considered in [14]. As was noted above, the overprediction of the
heat ﬂux was obtained in the computational solution.

The same eﬀect but more expressive is observed at Re = 70000. In Fig.1, the com-
putational results are compared against the experimental data for L/D = 2. Here and
below, the local Nusselt number is scaled by Re0.7P r0.4 where P r = 0.9. The solution [12]
based on the low-Reynolds number k
ǫ model predicts a substantially higher heat ﬂux
than the high-Reynolds number model. This eﬀect was obtained in many other publi-
cations including cited above. The solution based on the wall functions corresponds to
Rey∗ = 109. It is to be noted that the dependence of the solution on the parameter y∗
is quite weak. In the next example with L/D = 4, the solutions corresponding to diﬀer-
ent values of Rey∗ are shown in Fig.2. Though the value of y∗ is varied by an order of
magnitude, the curves are quite close each other.

The mean velocity proﬁles divided by the bulk velocity are shown in Fig.3 for L/D = 6.
The experimental data are represented by square symbols while the computational results
are shown by the curves. At the region of the low mean velocity nearby the axis of
symmetry (r/D = 0.5) the prediction of the velocity is quite accurate. At r/D = 3,
where the ﬂow is decelerated, the prediction is not so good. At this location, substantial
underprediction of the velocity in the near wall region and overprediction in the outer
region were earlier noted for both the LR and HR linear k

ǫ models [6, 12, 27].

In Fig.4 the distribution of the local Nusselt number is shown for Re = 23000. It is
given a comparison between the computational results and experimental data for L = 10D
and L = 14D. In these examples the wall is located far enough from the nozzle, and in
the computations the overprediction of the heat ﬂux nearby the axis of symmetry is not
observed.

5 Conclusion

The wall functions are formulated as boundary conditions of Robin–type and represented
in a diﬀerential form. These wall functions take into account source terms. The wall
functions are obtained in a compact easy-to-implement analytical form and they do not

10

include any adjustable parameters. The mesh distribution inside the computational do-
main can be chosen independently on the location of the intermediate boundary. The
implementation of the wall functions is robust due to their simultaneous formulation for
both a functions and its normal derivative. The Robin–type wall functions are written in a
universal formulation applicable to all dependent variables but ǫ including the kinetic tur-
bulent energy and normal velocity. General approaches to implementing the Robin–type
wall functions to ﬁnite–volume and ﬁnite–diﬀerence approximations are suggested.

On the base of the generalized wall functions implemented to the k

ǫ model the
axisymmetrical impinging jet is investigated. The computational results show a reasonable
correspondence to the experimental data and weak dependence of the solution on the
distance from a wall where the boundary conditions are set.

Further research can be devoted to application of the wall functions to separated ﬂows

and extension of them to LES.

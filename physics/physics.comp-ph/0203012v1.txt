We describe and systematically analyze new implementations of the Projection
Operator Imaginary Time Spectral Evolution (POITSE) method for the Monte
Carlo evaluation of excited state energies. The POITSE method involves the com-
putation of a correlation function in imaginary time. Decay of this function con-
tains information about excitation energies, which can be extracted by a spectral
transform. By incorporating branching processes in the Monte Carlo propaga-
tion, we compute these correlation functions with signiﬁcantly reduced statistical
noise. Our approach allows for the stable evaluation of small energy diﬀerences in
situations where the previous POITSE implementation was limited by this noise.

1 Introduction

The Projection Operator Imaginary Time Spectral Evolution (POITSE)
method has allowed calculation of excited states to be made with diﬀusion
Monte Carlo (DMC) without nodal constraints.1 The main requirement is
that a reasonable ground state wave function be available, which can be ob-
tained from well-established ground state methods such as DMC. The excited
states are then accessed via projector operators, whose evolution in imaginary
time contain information on excited state energies. In the POITSE method a
correlation function of the projection operators is evaluated by Monte Carlo
techniques, and then subsequently inverted to obtain spectral functions whose
peak positions correspond to excited state energies. This inversion requires
an inverse Laplace transform, a notoriously ill-conditioned numerical proce-
dure. In the applications of POITSE made to date,2,3,4 this inversion has been
performed with the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM).5 POITSE has con-
siderable power in allowing analysis of excited states without imposing nodal
restrictions. It is particularly useful when some physical insight about the
nature of the desired excited states is available. This information can be used
to tailor suitable projectors to obtain maximum overlap with the eigenstates
of interest. This has been demonstrated recently with permutation symme-

try tunneling excitations.4 In general, the viability and power of the method
has now been shown for a range of model systems involving atomic motions.2
It has been applied to several physical examples of cluster excitations which
cannot be addressed by basis set methods, including up to 15-dimensional
problems.3 To our knowledge, the method has not yet been systematically
applied to fermion problems, although there is no intrinsic impediment to
this.

In this paper we analyze the eﬃciency and accuracy of the POITSE al-
gorithm for various diﬀerent implementations of the DMC component of the
method. We present a modiﬁcation of the algorithm that allows the calcu-
lation of small energy diﬀerences with reduced statistical noise.
In Sec. 2,
we brieﬂy review the POITSE general formalism and explain in detail the
diﬀerent numerical implementations. Sec. 3 illustrates the diﬀerent imple-
mentations with two applications: the one-dimensional problem of the am-
monia inversion mode and the six-dimensional van der Waals vibration of the
4He-benzene dimer.

2 Computational Methodology

The general POITSE method involves the Monte Carlo evaluation of an
imaginary time (τ = it) correlation function ˜κ(τ ), and then a subsequent
inverse Laplace transform of this correlation function using the Maximum
Entropy Method. With an appropriately chosen correlation function, the in-
verse Laplace transform provides a spectral function whose peak positions
correspond to excitation energies. The basic theory1 and its application to
model systems2,3,4 have previously been described in detail, and thus we will
only present a brief summary of the relevant formalism.

2.1 Theory

The primary quantity of interest in POITSE is the spectral function κ(E),

κ(E) =

|hφ0| ˆA|φni|2δ(E − En + E0),

(1)

n
X

where {|φni} and {En} are a complete set of energy eigenkets and eigenener-
gies for the Hamiltonian ˆH, and ˆA is an operator chosen to connect |φ0i at
least approximately to the particular excited state(s) of interest |φni. Taking
the Laplace transform of Eq. (1), one can obtain the imaginary time correla-
tion function ˜κ(τ ), in atomic units (¯h = 1), as

˜κ(τ ) = hφ0| ˆAe−( ˆH−E0)τ ˆA†|φ0i

|hφ0| ˆA|φni|2e−(En−E0)τ .

(3)

n
X

The POITSE approach consists of evaluating ˜κ(τ ) by a Monte Carlo algo-
rithm, then taking its inverse Laplace transform to obtain the spectral func-
tion κ(E).

In most situations, however, the ground state |φ0i is not known exactly.
In practice, one typically employs a trial function |ΨT i and reference energy
Eref which approximate as closely as possible |φ0i and E0, respectively. Use
of a reference energy not equal to the exact ground state energy modiﬁes the
decay rate of all terms in Eq. (3) by a constant factor of Eref − E0. This
results in a systematic bias in the excitation energies of Eq. (1), independent
of the usual ﬁnite time step bias due to the DMC evaluation of Eq. (3). This
is also independent of whether the true ground state |φ0i is
bias from Eref
used.

It has been shown earlier1 that such systematic bias can be eliminated by

introducing the normalization factor

hΨT |e−( ˆH−Eref )τ |ΨT i.
The removal of bias due to Eref can be seen from the following arguments.
First, replacing |φ0i, E0 in Eq. (2) with |ΨT i, Eref , respectively, and dividing
by the additional normalization factor of Eq. (4), leads to the modiﬁed decay
function

(4)

hΨT | ˆAe−( ˆH−Eref )τ ˆA†|ΨT i
hΨT |e−( ˆH−Eref )τ |ΨT i

When |ΨT i = |φ0i, we see that Eq. (8) is identically equal to Eq. (3), and the
eﬀects of using a reference energy other than the true ground state energy are
completely eliminated. Additive errors of O(x) and higher are present when
an approximate ground state is used. Note that since the series expansion of
1
Eq. (7) is only convergent for c0 >
2 , this does require that a reasonable
approximation to the ground state be available. The higher order terms O(x)
q
contribute to the spectral function κ(E) in an additive manner. Consequently,
they do not aﬀect the positions of the relevant spectral features of interest, i.e.
the dominant leading terms of Eq. (8). In practice, for a reasonable choice of
|ΨT i these additional terms have highly reduced weight.1,6 To leading order
therefore, the renormalized decay Eq. (5) exhibits the time dependence of
Eq. (3), independent of the reference energy Eref . Consequently Eref may
be arbitrarily chosen and varied. The usefulness of this will become more
apparent below, in our discussion of numerical implementation.

The numerical inversion of ˜κ(τ ) to obtain κ(E) is an ill-conditioned prob-
lem, especially when Monte Carlo noise is non-negligible and/or when the
spectral function κ(E) contains multiple overlapping peaks of comparable in-
tensity. Thus a judicious choice of the operator ˆA is necessary to ensure that
the time-dependence of ˜κ(τ ) is dominated by only one or a few well-separated
energy diﬀerences. The inverse Laplace transform of ˜κ(τ ) is performed using
the Bryan implementation5 of the maximum entropy method. Our use of
this approach for the inversion of ˜κ(τ ) is identical to that employed in pre-
vious POITSE work.1,3,4,2 We will discuss choices for ˆA speciﬁc to particular
systems of study in Sec. 3.

) and EL(R(τ )

The quantities w(R(τ )
) are the usual DMC cumulative weight
and local energy, respectively.7 The evaluation of Eq. (10) begins with a varia-
tional Monte Carlo (VMC) walk in which an initial starting ensemble of walk-
ers distributed according to Ψ2
T (R) is generated using a simple Metropolis
method.7 The starting VMC ensemble is subsequently propagated in imagi-
nary time by a DMC sidewalk, during which Eq. (10) is sampled. Since the
maximum entropy analysis requires independent samples of ˜κ(τ ), the start-
ing conﬁguration for each DMC sidewalk is taken from the VMC walk every
100 − 200 VMC steps apart, to minimize correlations between successive side-
walks. The set of ˜κ(τ )’s evaluated in this manner serve as input for the
inverse Laplace transform via MEM. Typically 100 − 500 independent decays
are required to produce a converged spectrum κ(E).

In the original implementation of Blume et al.,1 the DMC weights w(R(τ )
)
take on a continuous range of values, and walkers are not destroyed or du-
plicated. We refer to this approach here as DMC with pure weights. This is
the preferable implementation in an ideal situation where high-quality trial
functions are available. However, for reasonably complex systems this is often
not the case. In addition, it has been shown that DMC with pure weights is
unstable for long propagation times.8 Therefore, as we demonstrate in Sec. 3,
a DMC sidewalk that uses pure weights may sometimes be impractical in
situations involving small energy diﬀerences.

j

A common solution to the problems associated with pure weights is to
introduce branching. The simplest branching scheme rounds the walker weight
at every step of the walk to an integer nj = int[w(R(τ )
) + ξ], where ξ is an
uniformly distributed random number on [0, 1). A walker R(τ )
for nj = 0; otherwise, nj copies of walker R(τ )
in the next DMC move. In this case, the weights w(R(τ )

where the index j denotes the parent walker at initial time τ = 0 from which

While the pure branching method is formally correct on average and is much
more stable numerically, the integer rounding of walker weights can neverthe-
less lead to greater statistical noise.9

To minimize this noise, one can employ a hybrid approach where each

or duplicated when its weight exceeds some predetermined bounds. In such
a situation, it is important that the branching procedure does not artiﬁcially
). A combined weighting
alter the ensemble sum of weights Wtot =
and branching scheme will in general exhibit less statistical noise than a pure
branching scheme. In some cases the noise reduction can be signiﬁcant. Our
implementation of branching is similar to that outlined in Ref. 10. About
every 20 − 50 DMC time steps, the ensemble is checked for walkers whose
weight exceeds the empirically determined bounds wmin and wmax . A walker

As discussed previously,

incorporation of the normalization factor of
Eq. (4) into ˜κ(τ ) results in a decay independent of the reference energy Eref .
Therefore we are free to choose and vary Eref based on considerations of nu-
merical stability. A common choice of Eref
is the variational energy of the
trial function, Eref = hΨT | ˆH|ΨT i/hΨT |ΨT i, which may be obtained from
a separate VMC calculation. One may also choose the ground state energy
Eref = E0, which is readily obtained from standard ground state DMC meth-
ods. In our implementation, we begin with an initial choice of Eref and update
Eref continuously during the course of the DMC walk according to

where η is an empirical update parameter chosen to be as small as possible
to avoid biasing the results, typically η/∆τ = 0.01 − 0.3. The eﬀect of this
updating procedure for Eref
is to keep the average walker weight close to
unity, thus preventing the ensemble size and sum of weights from diverging
oﬀ to inﬁnity or zero. The combination of these various mechanisms serve
to ensure a stable DMC walk for long times, thus allowing the evaluation of
small energy diﬀerences En − E0. In the examples presented in Sec. 3 we will
compare the eﬀects of the various DMC schemes described here.

A ﬁnal note in the implementation concerns the statistical errors in the
excited state energy diﬀerences En − E0. The MEM inversion of ˜κ(τ ) gives
the spectral function κ(E), whose peak positions correspond to excited state
energy diﬀerences. There is no general approach to assign error bars in the

mean peak position,2 and thus we only report energies to the last signiﬁcant
ﬁgure. We determine empirically the position of this last signiﬁcant ﬁgure by
examining the convergence of En − E0 with respect to the number of decays
˜κ(τ ) used as input for the MEM inversion. Because multiple projectors are
usually sampled from the same DMC sidewalk, the relative diﬀerences between
excited states are expected to be very accurate.

3 Examples

3.1 NH3 inversion

The ﬁrst application we discuss here is a POITSE study of the ammonia
inversion mode. Freezing all other internal degrees of freedom, the Schr¨odinger
equation for this mode alone is a one-dimensional problem which can be solved
exactly by a straightforward Discrete Variable Representation–Finite Basis
Representation (DVR–FBR) calculation.11 The Hamiltonian is given by
¯h2
2µ

∂2
∂h2 + V (h),

ˆH = −

(15)

where h is the distance between the nitrogen atom and the hydrogen plane,
µ is the eﬀective mass for the mode and V (h) is the double-well inversion
potential for tunneling across the hydrogen plane. We use one of the poten-
tial forms (“Case b”) proposed by Ni˜no et al.12 which leads to a tunneling
splitting of 1.43 cm−1 for the lowest tunneling pair, and 64.5 cm−1 for the
next lowest tunneling pair. The corresponding DVR–FBR energy levels are
listed in Table 1 as benchmarks for the POITSE results.

A double well study was previously made in Ref. 2 to demonstrate the
eﬀectiveness of the POITSE method for model systems. However, in that
example, the energy diﬀerences involved were much larger than those arising
in the NH3 inversion problem which we discuss here. While the inversion fre-
quency is high (993 cm−1), the POITSE method allows the computation of an
energy diﬀerence which is three orders of magnitude smaller. We compare here
two diﬀerent DMC implementations, namely pure weights and pure branch-
ing, and demonstrate the limitations associated with the former approach for

Table 1. Lowest four energy levels (in cm−1) for the inversion mode of NH3 relative to the

computing small energy diﬀerences. In order to make such a comparison of
implementations, it is convenient and indeed preferable to use a system for
which exact wave functions can be found.

The trial function ΨT (h) used in the Monte Carlo evaluation of Eq. (5)
was initially ﬁt to the DVR–FBR ground state eigenfunction Φ0(h), and then
further optimized by VMC. While numerous sophisticated VMC optimization
schemes exist,13,14,15 for a simple one-dimensional problem we found it suﬃ-
cient to manually vary the trial function parameters to minimize the ground
state energy and its variance. We use the analytical form

ΨT (h) = exp[a0eb0(h−c0)

+ a0eb0(h+c0)

2

+ d0ee0h4

],

(16)

where a0, b0, c0, d0, and e0 are parameters listed in Table 2. The corresponding
VMC energy is 561.4(3) cm−1, which is less than 2% above the exact ground
state value obtained from DVR–FBR.

Since the ﬁrst excited state Φ1(h) of a double well potential is the lowest
antisymmetric state, the projector ˆA = h was previously used2 to access this
level. In obtaining higher-lying states, choosing ˆA to be an integer power of h
led to a ˜κ(τ ) consisting of a superposition of multiple exponential decays. For
instance, a choice of ˆAΨT (h) = h2ΨT (h) resulted in non-negligible overlap
with multiple excited levels. Thus an accurate Laplace inversion of the corre-
sponding ˜κ(τ ) was more diﬃcult, due to the multiple decay contributions of
these states. We use here instead more eﬀective projectors given by the ratio
of the eigenfunctions

ˆAn =

Φn(h)
ΨT (h)

,

where Φn(h) is an excited state eigenfunction obtained from a DVR–FBR
calculation. Clearly if the eigenfunctions are numerically exact, this results in
an exact projector. Such projectors have also been shown to be useful when
only symmetry properties of the eigenfunctions are well characterized.4 The
following analytical expressions were ﬁtted to the DVR–FBR eigenfunctions
for the lowest three excited states (n = 1 − 3):

eﬃciency of two diﬀerent and alternative implementations of the POITSE al-
gorithm. In particular, we shall compare the extent of noise and time step
bias of the two diﬀerent approaches to the DMC evaluation of Eq. (5). Our
aim here is not the establish the generality of the method, or its accuracy for
a double well problem, both of which have been addressed in earlier work.1,2
Instead, we are interested in assessing the relative eﬃciency of diﬀerent im-
plementations, and thus it is preferable here to use projectors which are as
exact as possible.

Since the lowest tunneling splitting E1 − E0 is small, the correspond-
ing decay ˜κ(τ ) is slow and requires a long DMC propagation. Fig. 1a shows
four typical ˜κ(τ )’s computed using the original POITSE implementation in-
volving DMC with pure weights. These decays become extremely noisy as
the time τ increases. The ensemble local energy hELi also exhibits such be-
havior. This problem is well-known8 and arises from the fact that for long

or even moderate DMC propagation times, the Monte Carlo ensemble aver-
ages are dominated by only a few walkers carrying high relative weights. In
comparison, Fig. 1b shows typical ˜κ(τ )’s obtained from an implementation
using DMC sidewalks with pure branching, where walkers are replicated or
destroyed at each time step based on integer rounding of their weights as dis-
cussed in Sec. 2.2. In both calculations, 2000 walkers were propagated using
a time step ∆τ of 5 Hartree−1. Clearly there is far less noise at longer times
in the pure branching implementation, and thus such an approach is more
suitable for the evaluation of small energy diﬀerences. Using the pure branch-
ing scheme, the Laplace inversion of 600 decays computed up to a ﬁnal time
τf of 250000 Hartree−1 results in a single peak at 1.39 cm−1, in reasonable
agreement with the DVR–FBR value.

The evaluation of the larger energy diﬀerences E2 − E0 and E3 − E0 are
manageable using both DMC implementations, because the lengths of the
corresponding decays are much shorter than for the lowest energy diﬀerence
E1 − E0. The use of the projector given in Eq. (17) facilitates the Laplace
inversion, since each choice of ˆAn results in a ˜κ(τ ) consisting of only one
exponential decay. In these calculations, 1000 decays are used as input for
the MEM inversion, with each decay computed using an ensemble of 2000
DMC walkers propagated to a ﬁnal time τf of 1500 Hartree−1. The number
of decays required for a converged κ(E) depends on the energy diﬀerence of
interest and on the time step ∆τ . In general, for larger time steps, DMC with
pure weights requires more sampling to produce fully converged results.

Since DMC methods are subject to a systematic time step bias, we per-
form a comparative study of the two implementations and their time step
dependence. For the computation of the lowest energy diﬀerence E1 − E0
using DMC with pure branching, we ﬁnd a time step of 5 Hartree−1 to be
suﬃciently small to give an accurate result within statistical error. However,
the time step dependence of higher energy diﬀerences is not necessarily the
same as that for E1 − E0. Fig. 2 presents the time step dependence for the
calculation of E2 − E0 and E3 − E0, using both DMC with pure weights (solid
circles) and DMC with pure branching (open diamonds). It is evident that for
both DMC implementations, the higher energy diﬀerences are more sensitive
to time step bias than the lowest energy diﬀerence, E1 − E0. Thus, in order to
extract the correct energies in the higher energy range, either a smaller time
step would need to be used, or an extrapolation to ∆τ = 0 would need to be
performed.

With this simple example, we have shown that two diﬀerent POITSE im-
plementations, namely DMC with pure weights and DMC with pure branch-
ing, lead to the same results. We have also presented a systematic study of the

We now demonstrate the use of the POITSE approach for the computation of
excited vibrational energies of the 4He-benzene dimer. We treat the benzene
as a rigid molecule, and for simplicity we also neglect the rotational kinetic
energy of the benzene, i.e. the rotation of benzene relative to helium. In the
space-ﬁxed frame, the resulting Hamiltonian is

ˆH = −

where m0 is the benzene mass, m is the helium mass, ∇2
0 is the Laplacian with
respect to the benzene center-of-mass position r0, ∇2
k is the Laplacian with
respect to the helium position rk, and V (r) is the 4He-benzene interaction
potential. The latter depends only on the relative coordinate vector r =
rk − r0. The potential is an analytical ﬁt16 to ab initio MP2 calculations of
Hobza et al.,17 and possesses two equivalent global minima of −66.01 cm−1
along the six-fold C6-axis, situated at 3.27 ˚A above and below the benzene

plane. While in principle one could transform the Hamiltonian to the center-
of-mass frame to yield a three-dimensional problem, as would typically be
done in a basis set calculation, sampling the transformed kinetic energy terms
becomes more complicated in DMC as additional particles are added, and thus
it is technically simpler for us to work with the six-dimensional Hamiltonian
as written in Eq. (21).

The trial function ΨT (r) is the product of an anisotropic Gaussian binding
factor centered on the benzene center-of-mass, and an atom-atom repulsive
factor,

ΨT (r) = e−a(x2

where we use for the binding parameters (in atomic units) a = 0.05, c = 0.06.
The product over α and β runs over the carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms,
respectively. The atom-atom terms tα(rα) and tβ(rβ ) are functions of 4He-
carbon and 4He-hydrogen distances rα and rβ respectively, and their analyt-
ical forms are chosen to cancel out the leading singularities in the atom-
atom potential energy terms.18 In this study we use tα(rα) = −cαr−6
α ,
tβ(rβ) = −cβr−5
β , with the parameters (in atomic units) cα = 6000, cβ = 8000.
The trial function of Eq. (22) possesses the same D6h symmetry as the 4He-
benzene potential.

A ground state DMC calculation using the trial function and potential
discussed above gives a ground state energy E0 = −21.61(2) cm−1, which
corresponds to about 32% of the global energy minimum of the 4He-benzene
potential. Such a high zero-point energy is typical of helium van der Waals
systems,19 and underscores the need for a fully quantum mechanical treatment
of the van der Waals degrees of freedom.

We choose the excitation operators ˆA(Γ) based on symmetry considera-
tions, where the superscript Γ denotes an irreducible representation of the
D6h point group. Since the trial function ΨT (r) transforms as the totally
symmetric representation A1g, for a given ˆA(Γ), the integral hΨT | ˆA(Γ)|φni in
Eq. (8) is only nonzero for states |φni which transform as Γ. Thus an ap-
propriate choice of ˆA(Γ) will, by symmetry, signiﬁcantly reduce the number
of terms in the summation of Eq. (8), leaving only decay terms whose char-
acteristic decay times are presumably more well-separated, and thus easier
to resolve. The various choices of the operators ˆA(Γ) we use here are listed
in Table 3, where ˆA(Γ) is deﬁned with respect to the benzene principal axis
frame centered on the benzene center-of-mass. In this coordinate system, the
x-axis is perpendicular to the benzene C-C bond, the y-axis lies along the
benzene C-H bond, and the z-axis is perpendicular to the benzene plane.

To evaluate the correlation function ˜κ(τ ), we sample an initial ensemble
of 1000 walkers from every 100 steps of a VMC walk. This initial ensemble
is propagated by a DMC sidewalk with a time step of ∆τ = 10 Hartree−1.
In the 4He-benzene system, the energy diﬀerences of interest are suﬃciently
large such that we can employ and compare all three DMC implementations
discussed in Sec. 2.2. For the hybrid branching/weighting scheme, the en-
semble size and sum of weights in the DMC propagation are kept at approx-
imately 1000 on average by choosing an appropriate set of DMC parameters
wmin , wmax , and η (Eq. (14)). For DMC with pure weights and DMC with
pure branching, the only adjustable parameter is the update parameter η.
About 500 independent decays ˜κ(τ ) are generated in this manner, and subse-
quently used as input for the MEM inversion, resulting in the spectral function
κ(E). Each choice of projector ˆA(Γ) results in a single dominant peak in the
corresponding κ(E), and the peak positions are listed in Table 3. These ex-
cited state energies show general agreement (to within ∼ 0.2 cm−1) between
the three DMC implementations.

In Fig. 3 we superimpose the spectral functions obtained using the hy-
brid branching/weighting approach. There, the peaks are grouped in dou-
blets whose splittings range from ∼ 0.2 − 0.7 cm−1. These doublets are
due to projectors which are symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to
reﬂection about the benzene plane. They constitute a tunneling splitting

between the two equivalent global potential minima along the benzene C6-
axis, above and below the aromatic ring plane. Tunneling of helium around
a planar moiety has also been observed in basis set calculations for the
2,3-dimethylnaphthalene·He complex, where the magnitude of the splittings
ranged from < 10−4 cm−1 for localized states up to 3.2 cm−1 for highly de-
localized states.20 The tunneling splittings which we obtain here exhibit a
decrease in magnitude with increasing energy. Since the energies of highest
levels correspond to about 12% of the 4He-benzene potential energy minimum,
this decrease in the tunneling splitting can be attributed to increasing anhar-
monicities in the 4He-benzene interaction potential as these levels approach
dissociation. Inclusion of the benzene rotational kinetic energy term into the
Hamiltonian of Eq. (21) qualitatively changes the features of the energy spec-
trum, removing this decrease in the tunnel splitting. The speciﬁc eﬀects of
this rotational contribution, as well as the general physics of 4HeN -benzene
clusters, will be reported in a future study.21

4 Conclusion

We have extended the applicability of the POITSE method by introducing
branching processes in the DMC evaluation of an imaginary time correlation
function ˜κ(τ ). The eﬀects of branching were tested in the determination of

excited state energies for two simple systems, namely the one-dimensional
ammonia inversion mode and the six-dimensional 4He-benzene van der Waals
modes. While in an ideal situation one would employ a pure weighting scheme
in the DMC propagation, in the ammonia study we were faced with the prob-
lem of evaluating a slowly decaying ˜κ(τ ) corresponding to a small tunneling
splitting. Thus, the incorporation of branching in the DMC sidewalk is es-
sential for the stable computation of small energy diﬀerences. We have also
provided a comparison between the various branching schemes and the pure
weighting scheme in the 4He-benzene example, and have demonstrated that
the results obtained are in good numerical agreement.

The incorporation of branching as described here has been critical in
allowing excited state energies to now be evaluated for much larger systems
using the POITSE approach.21,22 Another current modiﬁcation in progress
includes the implementation of descendant weighting techniques23,9,24,25 to
construct an estimate of the exact ground state wave function |φ0i “on-the-
ﬂy”. The projector ˆA would then operate on the exact |φ0i, instead of an
approximate trial function |ΨT i. These improvements in the general POITSE
methodology open the way for eﬃcient and accurate Monte Carlo evaluation
of excited state energies for large systems.

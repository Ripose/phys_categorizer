Abstract

We report on experience with an investigation of the analytic structure of the
solution of certain algebraic complex equations. In particular the behavior of their
series expansions around the origin is discussed. The investigation imposes the need
for an analysis of the singularities and the Riemann sheets of the solution, in which
numerical methods are used.

In various problems in theoretical physics we have encountered problems that are formu-
lated as follows: consider an entire function F of a complex number y, such that

with nonnegative integer m (in practice, we have met cases with m = 1 and m = 2). The
task at hand is then to ﬁnd information about y = y(x) such that

In general, both the form of the series expansion of y(x) around x = 0 and the nature
of its singularities are of interest. Such questions arise, for instance, in the combinatorial
problem of determining the number of Feynman diagrams contributing to given scattering
amplitudes in various quantum ﬁeld theories [1], in the computation of the oscillation period
of nontrivial one-dimensional potential wells [2], in the statistical bootstrap model for hot
hadronic matter (refs.
in [3] and for a recent discussion see [4]), and in renormalization
theory connected with the ’t Hooft transformation [5]. An important and interesting
example, studied in detail in [3], is the so-called bootstrap equation:

which obviously has m = 1. We shall consider functions F of the more general form

FB(y) = 2y + 1

F (y) = P (y) + eyQ(y) ,

2y + 2ey ,

where P and Q are polynomials of ﬁnite degree dP > 0 and dQ ≥
0, respectively, with
real coeﬃcients. As our working example, taken from [2], we shall consider the function
F1 deﬁned as

for which m = 2. In this paper we shall concentrate on the analysis of the Riemann sheet
structure of those solutions of these equations that have a series expansion around x = 0.
To determine the asymptotic behavior of these expansions, the nature of the singularities
will be analyzed numerically. The results are justiﬁed by the fact that, in our calculations,
only ﬁnite computer accuracy is required, as we shall demonstrate.

2 Identiﬁcation of the Riemann sheets

As a ﬁrst step we identify the various Riemann sheets by their value of y(0): the sheet
labeled s will have y(0) = Ys for that sheet. Obviously, y(0) = 0 is a solution with
multiplicity m. In general, there will be dP solutions if Q(y) = 0, and inﬁnitely many if
Q is non-vanishing. It will be helpful if we can identify the Riemann sheet on which pairs

it using F1. Let us write y = ξ + iη with ξ and η real numbers. We are then looking for

we give the values of Ys for F1, for the ﬁrst few values of s. Because the values Ys fall in
disjoint intervals, for small x we need to know y(x) only to a limited accuracy in order to
be able to identify its Riemann sheet. The only nontrivial case is that of sheets
1 and 1,
where it is suﬃcient to consider the complex arguments: for arg(x)
arg(y) = 0 we are on
sheet 1, for
1. Again, limited computer accuracy
is acceptable here, and for larger m we simply have m diﬀerent values of the argument,
distinguished in an analogous manner. Note that of course the labeling of the sheets is
rather arbitrary: we have chosen the odd integers in order to emphasize that both sheet 1
1 can be considered the principal Riemann sheet. For the bootstrap equation (3) it
and
is more natural to label the single principal Riemann sheet with y(0) = 0 as sheet number
zero.

3 Series expansion

We want to compute y(x) as a Taylor series around x = 0:

y(x) =

αnxn .

(7)

Obviously, α0 can be chosen as one of the us above. On principal sheets, with α0 = 0, we
also have immediately that α1 must be chosen out of the m possibilities with αm
1 = 1. The
other coeﬃcients must then be computed (algebraically or numerically) by some recursive
method, which we shall now discuss.

It would be straightforward to plug the expansion (7) into Eq.(2) and equate the powers
of x on both sides, but notice that, for Q non-vanishing, the number of possible products
of coeﬃcients grows very rapidly, so that the computer time needed to ﬁnd the ﬁrst N
coeﬃcients grows exponentially with N. As already mentioned in [3], the better way is to
diﬀerentiate Eq. (2) with respect to x so that we obtain the nonlinear diﬀerential equation

y′(x) [P ′(y)Q(y) + (Q(y) + Q′(y))(xm

P (y))] = mxm−1Q(y) .

−
This equation yields a recursion relation involving products of at most dP + dQ + 1 co-
eﬃcients, so that a truncated power series can be computed in polynomial time. As an
example, for F1 we ﬁnd the following diﬀerential equation:

(8)

y′(x)(x2 + 2y(x)) = 2x ,

and the following recursion relation:

α0α1 = 0 ,

We see immediately that y(x) is necessarily even in x if α0 6
= 0, i.e. on the non-principal
Riemann sheets. In that case, we also see that if αn, n = 0, 2, . . . is a solution, then also
α∗
n, n = 0, 2, . . . is a solution, where the asterix stands for complex conjugation. This is
a result of the fact that if y(x) is a solution of Eq. (5), then also y∗(x∗) is a solution. In
practice, these solutions give the function values on the diﬀerent Riemann sheets of one
solution. The analysis of the previous section proves that ys(0) = y−s(0)∗ so that the

The recursion appears to be stable in the forward direction, but we have not tried to prove
this or examine the stability in the general case.

In series expansions it is of course always important to know the convergence properties
or, equivalently, the asymptotic behavior of αn as n becomes very large. In the next section,
we therefore turn to the singularity structure of y(x).

4 Singularities and branches

In order to ﬁnd information about the singularity structure of y(x), we employ the tech-
niques developed in [1], which we recapitulate here. Singularities are situated at those
values yk of y where

Since F is entire we also know that these singular points must form an enumerable set, i.e.
we can ﬁnd, and label, them as distinct points. We shall assume that these singularities
are square-root branch points, for which it is necessary that

If F ′′ vanishes at yk but F ′′′ does not, we have a cube-root branch point, and so on. If,
for non-vanishing Q, all derivatives vanish (as for instance when F (y) = ey) we have, of
course, a logarithmic branch point. We know that y =
corresponds to a logarithmic
branch point, and it is to remove this to inﬁnity in the x plane that we have required
dP > 0. In our examples all the singularities at ﬁnite x will be square-root branch points.
The position of the singularity in the x plane, xk, is of course given by

−∞

F ′(yk) = 0 .

so that there are m diﬀerent possible positions, lying equally spaced on a circle around the
origin. We shall denote them by xk,p with p = 1, 2, . . . , m. Note that, in ﬁrst instance, it
is not clear at all whether xk,p for certain k and p is indeed a singular point on a speciﬁc
Riemann sheet. Later on, we shall describe how to determine this numerically. For values
of x close to an observed singular point xk,p we may expand the left-hand and right-hand
side of Eq. (2) to obtain

Note that there are only two possible values for βk,p, and each singular point xk,p goes with
one or the other of these. Again numerical methods will help in determining which one of
the two is the correct choice.

We are now in a position to compute the asymptotic behavior of the coeﬃcients αn. To
ﬁnd it, we ﬁrst determine, for a given Riemann sheet, which are the xk,p that lie closest to
the origin: this gives us the radius of convergence of the expansion of y(x) in that Riemann

shall do this numerically, in the way described in the following section. Let us denote the
set of values of p for which this is the case by

Amongst other things, this provides a powerful numerical check on the accuracy of the αn
as computed by the recursive technique. We shall now discuss how the singularity structure
of our problem can be investigated numerically.

5 Computer searches for sheet structures

The main tool we use for our computer studies is a method for taking small steps over
a Riemann sheet, that is, given the fact that for some value x1 the point y1 = y(x1) is
determined to belong to a certain Riemann sheet, we perform a small step ∆x to a point
x2 and ﬁnd the point y2 = y(x2) on the same Riemann sheet. Our method to do this is
nothing but Newton-Raphson iteration: we simply iterate the mapping

(18)

(19)

(20)

←

,

until satisfactory convergence is obtained. The starting value for this iteration is just the
point y1. A few remarks are in order here. In the ﬁrst place, it must be noted that for this
method to work, y1 must be in the basin of attraction of y2. Since, except at the branch
points, which we shall expressly avoid, y(x) is a continuous and diﬀerentiable function
of x, this can always be arranged by taking ∆x small enough. In the second place, the
accuracy with which y1 is actually a solution of Eq. (2) is not important as long as it is
in the basin of attraction of y2: therefore, there is no buildup of numerical errors in this
method if we restrict ourselves to just keeping track of which Riemann sheet we are on.
Finally, problems could arise if two Riemann sheet values of y for the same x are very
close. But, since F is an entire function, we know that the solutions of Eq. (2) must either
completely coincide or be separated by a ﬁnite distance, any inadvertent jump from one
sheet to another can be detected and cured by, again, taking a small enough ∆x.

We have applied the following method for detecting and characterizing the various
singular points. We start on a Riemann sheet s1 at a value x close to zero, and determine

5

y(x) on that Riemann sheet. We then let the parameter x follow a prescribed contour
that circles a selected would-be singularity xk,p once (and no other singularities), and then
returns to the starting point close to the origin. We then determine to which Riemann
sheet the resulting y belongs. In this way we can ﬁnd whether xk,p is, in fact, a singular
point for the starting sheet, and, if so, which two sheets are connected there. It is also
possible, of course, to certify the square-root branch point nature of a singular point by
circling twice around it, and checking that one returns to the original Riemann sheet.

One important remark is in order here.

In our tracking over the Riemann sheet, it
is necessary that we do not cross branch cuts (except of course the one connected to the
putative singularity). Since these branch cuts can be moved around in the complex x
plane, the contour chosen deﬁnes the (relative) position of the branch cuts. The sheets
that are said to be connected at a particular branch cut are therefore also determined by
the choice of contour. Of course, choosing a diﬀerent contour will change the whole system
of interconnected sheets in a consistent manner, so that in fact, given one choice of contour
and its system of sheets, we can work out what system of sheets will correspond to another
choice of contour. We shall illustrate this in the following.

Suppose, now, that xk,p is one of the singular points on a certain sheet that is closest
to the origin. We can then follow, on that sheet, a straight line running from x1 close to
the origin to a point x2 for which x2/xk,p is real and just a bit smaller than one. Since xk,p
is by assumption closest to the origin, there is then no ambiguity involved in determining
which one of the two possible complex arguments of βk,p we have to take. Thus, we can
ﬁnd all the information needed to compute the asymptotic behavior of αn on that sheet.

6 An example

Having established the necessary machinery, we shall now discuss a concrete example of our
method. For this, we have taken the function F1 of Eq. (5). It is, in fact, closely related to
the very well-understood bootstrap equation (3): by substituting, in Eq. (3), y
log 2 + y
x2, we obtain Eq. (5). Its Riemann sheet structure, however, is quite
and x
diﬀerent, as we shall see. Note that under this transformation, the origin x = 0, y = 0 for
F1 corresponds to the ﬁrst singularity in FB.

value of ǫ is simply opposite.

6.2 The Riemann sheet structure

We now have to discuss how the branch cuts should run in the complex x plane. There are
two simple options (and an inﬁnity of more complicated ones): in the ﬁrst option (I), we
choose to let the branch cuts extend away from the origin parallel to the real axis. This
corresponds to tracking a contour that, say, ﬁrst moves in the imaginary direction, and
then in the real direction, to arrive close to the chosen singularity. The other option (II) is
to take the cuts parallel to the imaginary axis, so that a contour that does not cross branch
cuts en route ﬁrst goes in the real direction, and then in the imaginary direction. Note that
these two alternatives do, indeed, correspond to diﬀerent implied relative positionings of
the branch cuts. In Fig. 1.b we show the contour used in examining singularity x2,1 under
option I. The contour starts on sheet number 1 close to the origin (so that y is close to Y1),
moves upwards and then to the left, circles the singularity once anti-clockwise, and returns
to its starting point by the same route in order to enable us to determine the resulting
Riemann sheet number. Fig.1.c shows the corresponding path in the y plane. It ends again
close to Y1 so that, for this choice of contour and its induced branch structure (indicated
in the ﬁgure), sheet 1 does not have a branch point at x2,1. Fig. 1.d shows what happens
if, instead of sheet number 1, we start at sheet number 3: the y track starts then at close
to Y3, but ends up close to Y5, so that we conclude that sheets 3 and 5 are connected at
x2,1. If we run through the whole contour twice, we get the y track presented in Fig. 1.e,
where the y track ends up again at Y3 as expected for a square root branch cut. Under
option II, we rather use the contour indicated in Fig. 2.a, which ﬁrst moves to the left and

then upwards. Fig. 2.b shows the resulting y path, which does not return to Y1 but rather
to Y5, indicating that under this choice of contour the sheets labeled 1 and 5 are connected
at x2,1. Fig. 2.c shows that, now, sheet 3 is insensitive to this singularity.

In this way we have mapped the various singularities around the origin. In Tab. 2 we
present the pairs of sheets that are pairwise connected at the ﬁrst few singularities, under
option I, and the observed value for ǫ, which turns out to be
1 in all cases. We point
out that at each singularity only two sheets out of all inﬁnitely many are connected. Note
the somewhat atypical situation at the lowest-lying singularities x1,±1 and x−1,±1. The
alternative option II results in Tab. 3. Note that the higher-lying singularities now show
a sheet structure similar to the lowest ones. In fact, this is the choice that corresponds
most directly to the analysis of the sheet structure of the bootstrap equation in [3], with of
course the extra complication in the fact that the bootstrap equation (3) has m = 1 while
for F1, m = 2. Note that, once again, ǫ =

1 in all cases.

Higher Riemann sheets. We ﬁrst consider positive sheet label s = 3, 5, 7, . . . and put
k = (s

1)/2. We then have

As we have already seen αn vanishes for odd n, and for even n we have the following
asymptotic form:

for integer p. For negative s, we use Eq. (11), which also holds asymptotically.

7 Conclusion

We have shown how numerical tracking can be helpful in the investigation of the Riemann
sheet structure of the solution of certain algebraic complex equations. Furthermore, we
have shown how the series expansions around the origin on the diﬀerent sheets and the
asymptotic behavior of their coeﬃcients can be determined. The results of the numerical
analyses have been justiﬁed by the fact that only ﬁnite computer accuracy was required in
the speciﬁc calculations.

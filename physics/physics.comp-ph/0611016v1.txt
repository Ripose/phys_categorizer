Abstract

In this paper, three-dimensional (3D) multi-relaxation time (MRT) lattice-Boltzmann

(LB) models for multiphase ﬂow are presented. In contrast to the Bhatnagar-Gross-

Krook (BGK) model, a widely employed kinetic model, in MRT models the rates

of relaxation processes owing to collisions of particle populations may be indepen-

dently adjusted. As a result, the MRT models oﬀer a signiﬁcant improvement in nu-

merical stability of the LB method for simulating ﬂuids with lower viscosities. We

show through the Chapman-Enskog multiscale analysis that the continuum limit

behavior of 3D MRT LB models corresponds to that of the macroscopic dynami-

cal equations for multiphase ﬂow. We extend the 3D MRT LB models developed

to represent multiphase ﬂow with reduced compressibility eﬀects. The multiphase

models are evaluated by verifying the Laplace-Young relation for static drops and

the frequency of oscillations of drops. The results show satisfactory agreement with

available data and signiﬁcant gains in numerical stability.

1 Introduction

In recent years, computational methods based on the lattice-Boltzmann equa-

tion (LBE) have attracted much attention. They are based on the paradigm

of simulating complex emergent physical phenomena by employing minimal

discrete kinetic models that represent the interactions and spatial and tem-

poral evolution of quasi-particles on a lattice [1,2]. Originally developed to

overcome certain drawbacks such as the presence of statistical noise and the

lack of Galilean invariance of lattice-gas automaton (LGA) [3], the lattice-

Boltzmann equation (LBE) [4] has undergone a number of further reﬁnements.

They include enhanced representation of collisions of particle populations

through a relaxation process [5] which was further simpliﬁed by employing

the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) approximation [6] later [7,8]. Also, its for-

mal connection to the Boltzmann equation, developed in the framework of

non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, was established [9].

The LBE has the beneﬁcial feature that by incorporating physics at scales

smaller than macroscopic scales, complex ﬂuid ﬂows such as multiphase ﬂows

can be simulated [10]. In particular, phase segregation and interfacial ﬂuid

dynamics can be simulated by incorporating inter-particle potentials [11], con-

cepts based on free energy [12] or the kinetic theory of dense ﬂuids [13,14,15].

The inter-particle potential approach in Ref. [11], is an earlier LBE approach

for multiphase ﬂows and is based on non-local pseudo-potentials between par-

ticle populations. On the other hand, free-energy based methods are derived

from thermodynamic principles that naturally provide interfacial multiphase

ﬂow physics [12]. The LBE approaches based on kinetic theory of dense ﬂuids

represent physics based on mean-ﬁeld interaction forces and exclusion vol-

ume eﬀects [13,14,15]. More recently, LBE models have also been developed

to handle high density ratio problems, which also overcome some of the other

limitations of earlier approaches [16,17]. In general, the approaches above em-

ployed the BGK approximation to represent the collision process in the LBE

and some of their applications in 3D are presented in Ref. [18].

It is well known that the BGK model, a single-relaxation time model, of-

ten results in numerical instability when ﬂuids with relatively low viscosities

are simulated [19]. The instability problems may be compounded in three-

dimensional (3D) ﬂows when physics may not be adequately resolved owing

to computational constraints. To address this limitation with the standard LB

models, several approaches have been proposed. In one approach, known as

the entropic lattice Boltzmann method(ELBE), the equilibrium distribution

function is deﬁned in such a way that it minimizes a certain convex function,

a Lyapunov functional designated as the H

function, under the constraint

−

of local conservation laws [20,21]. As a result, it ensures the positivity of the

distribution function of particle populations and thus improves the numerical

stability. While this approach is endowed with elegant and desirable physical

features, its numerical accuracy is not established and it would incur relatively

heavy computational overhead [22].

Alternatives to the BGK model have been proposed to improve numerical

stability. In the multi-relaxation time (MRT) method [23], by choosing dif-

3

ferent and carefully separated time scales to represent changes in the various

physical processes due to collisions, the stability of the LBE can be signiﬁ-

cantly improved [19]. Another interesting approach is the fractional time step

method [25]. In this approach, stability is improved by considering fractional

propagation of particle populations by reducing time step, which increases

computational time. While this approach was employed for the BGK model,

the underlying idea is not limited to a particular collision model. Indeed such

an approach could be employed in conjunction with the MRT model to fur-

ther improve stability. Yet another possibility for improving stability is based

on the so-called two-relaxation time (TRT) models (e.g. Ref. [26]). These are

variants of the MRT models and can be considered as limiting cases of the

more general MRT models.

In addition to the computational advantage of signiﬁcantly improved stabil-

ity, the MRT models also have physical advantages in that they are ﬂexible

enough to incorporate additional physics that cannot be naturally represented

by the models based on the BGK approximation. In contrast to the BGK mod-

els, MRT models deal with the moments of the distribution functions, such as

momentum and viscous stresses directly. This moment representation provides

a natural and convenient way to express various relaxation processes due to

collisions, which often occur at diﬀerent time scales. Since the BGK model

can represent only a single relaxation time for all processes, it cannot nat-

urally represent physics in certain complex ﬂuids. For example, as discussed

in Ref. [27], BGK models cannot represent all the essential physics in vis-

coelastic ﬂows in 3D. Moreover, MRT models make it possible to incorporate

appropriate acoustic and thermal properties through adjustable Prandtl num-

bers for simulating thermo-hydrodynamics by employing a hybrid LBE/ﬁnite-

4

diﬀerence model [28]. BGK-based models are not able to do so naturally. Also,

in a more recent work, MRT models have been shown to be capable of han-

dling more general forms of diﬀusional transport than possible with the BGK

model [30]. In addition to the capability of dealing with genuinely anisotropic

diﬀusion problems, their MRT formulation is able to suppress directional ar-

tifacts arising due to discrete lattice eﬀects even in isotropic problems. Such

features are possible with MRT models because they lend themselves readily to

constructing and controlling various models to evolve at rates consistent with

the dynamics of physical phenomena of interest. Indeed, approaches based on

the MRT representation are inspired by the moment method developed in the

seminal work of Maxwell [31] which was further developed by Grad [32].

While prior works have demonstrated the computational advantages of the

MRT models for single-phase ﬂows in 2D by Lallemand and Luo [19] and in

3D by d’Humi`eres et al. [24] and for turbulence modeling [29], it has not been

shown for multiphase ﬂows in 3D in previous works. Multiphase ﬂows involve

additional physical complexity as a result of interfacial physics involved - i.e.,

phase segregation and surface tension eﬀects. In this case, the accuracy of the

numerical discretization of the source terms representing interfacial physics

becomes an important consideration and needs to be incorporated carefully

into the framework of the MRT model. These terms should be modeled in

a way that, when we establish their relation with the various moments, the

dynamical equations in the asymptotic limit should correspond to the desired

macroscopic behavior for multiphase ﬂow. These elements were not considered

in single-phase MRT models. We introduce a second-order discretization of

these source terms and avoid implicitness through a transformation which, to

our best knowledge, is applied to MRT models for multiphase ﬂows in 3D for

5

the ﬁrst time in this work. Recently, a MRT model for 2D multiphase problems

was developed [34]. There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the development and

implementation of 2D and 3D MRT models. These will be discussed below.

Furthermore, realistic multiphase ﬂows are 3D in nature and in this work,

we develop a 3D MRT model for such problems by employing a model for

interfacial physics based on the kinetic theory of dense ﬂuids [13,14,15].

The speciﬁc contributions of this work will now be stated. We develop a

3D MRT model incorporating phase segregation and surface tension eﬀects

through source terms discretized by using trapezoidal rule integration and

simpliﬁed through a transformation to achieve an eﬀectively explicit 3D MRT

model for multiphase ﬂows. Since the underlying lattice structure for 2D and

3D models are diﬀerent, the moment basis for the corresponding MRT mod-

els are diﬀerent, and is more complicated in 3D. We present the theoretical

developments based on the 3D moment basis for multiphase ﬂow which, to

our best knowledge, has not been considered in prior work. We derive the

continuum equations for multiphase ﬂow from the 3D MRT model through a

Chapman-Enskog analysis [33], provide the dynamical relations between the

various moments and forcing terms representing interfacial physics including

surface tension forces, develop the relationships between the gradients of mo-

mentum ﬁelds in terms of the non-equilibrium parts of certain moments and

their corresponding relaxation times, and explicitly derive the relationship be-

tween the transport coeﬃcients for the ﬂuid ﬂow and appropriate relaxation

times. To improve the stability of the approach, the model is then transformed

in such a way that compressibility eﬀects are reduced. Furthermore, we evalu-

ate the accuracy and gains in stability of the MRT model for some canonical

multiphase problems in 3D.

6

As the MRT models are endowed with greater computational stability and

potential to incorporate additional physics, there is considerable interest in

their applications to multiphase problems: The 2D MRT model developed

by McCracken and Abraham [34] extended for axisymmetric problems using

the axisymmetric LB model [35] has been employed to study the physics of

break up of liquid jets [36]. This axisymmetric MRT model and the 3D MRT

model developed in this work have also been employed to study the physics

of head-on as well as oﬀ-center binary drop collisions, respectively [37]. The

physically inspired MRT approach developed in this paper also provides a

natural framework for incorporating additional physics such as viscoelastic or

thermal eﬀects in multiphase ﬂows through an LB model, which are subjects

of future work. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the

3D MRT LBE multiphase models are developed. In Section 3, the macroscopic

dynamical equations of these models are derived by using a Chapman-Enskog

multiscale analysis. Section 4 transforms the model to simulate multiphase

ﬂow with reduced compressibility eﬀects. In Section 5, the model is applied to

benchmark problems to evaluate its accuracy and gains in stability. Finally,

the paper closes with summary and conclusions in Section 6.

2 3D MRT LBE Model for Multiphase Flow

We develop a MRT model for multiphase ﬂows in which the underlying inter-

facial physics is based on the kinetic theory of dense ﬂuids. In particular, we

consider that the particle populations representing the dense ﬂuids experience

mean-ﬁeld interaction forces and respect Enskog eﬀects for dense non-ideal

ﬂuids [13,14]. The eﬀect of collisions of particle populations is represented

7

though a generalized relaxation process in which the distribution functions

for discrete velocity directions approach their corresponding local equilibrium

values at characteristic time scales given in terms of a generalized collision or

scattering matrix.

In the following, we consider subscripts with Greek symbols for particle ve-

locity directions and Latin symbols for Cartesian components of spatial direc-

tions. We assume summation convention for repeated indices for the compo-

nents of spatial directions. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we follow the

convention that vectors corresponding to three-dimensional position space are

represented by non-capitalized symbols with arrowheads; the vectors with a

particle velocity basis are denoted by non-capitalized boldface symbols; the

square matrices constructed from the particle velocity basis are represented by

non-boldface capitalized symbols. We consider the following MRT LBE with

a source term that gives rise to phase segregation and surface tension eﬀects:

fα(−→x , t) = Ωα|(x,t) +

h

Sα|(x,t) + Sα|(x+eαδt,t+δt)

δt.

i

Here, fα is the discrete single-particle distribution function, corresponding to

the particle velocity, −→eα, where α is the velocity direction. The Cartesian com-

ponent of the particle velocity c, is given by c = δx/δt, where δx is the lattice

spacing and δt is the time step. The left hand side (LHS) of this equation rep-

resents the change in the distribution function as particle populations advect

from one lattice node to its adjacent one along the characteristic direction

represented by the discrete lattice velocity direction −→eα (see Figs. 1 and 2).

On the other hand, the right hand side (RHS) represents the eﬀect of particle

collisions and force interactions.

8

The form of the collision term Ωα that incorporates MRT collision processes

will be discussed below. The source term Sα which models the interfacial

physics in multiphase ﬂow needs to be accurately represented. In Eq. (1), we

considered a second-order trapezoidal rule discretization of this term. It may

be written as [13]

Sα =

(eαj −

uj)(F I

where F I
j

is the interaction force term that models the interfacial physics,

while Fext,j corresponds to external or imposed forces such as gravity. F I
j

is

modeled as a function of density following the work of van der Waals [38].

The exclusion-volume eﬀect of Enskog [33] is also incorporated to account for

increase in collision probability due to the increase in the density of non-ideal

ﬂuids. These features account for the phase segregation and surface tension

eﬀects. For more details, the reader is referred to Ref. [13]. In Eq. (2), f eq,M

is

α

the local discrete Maxwellian and its functional expression will be presented

In Eq. (3), Fs,j represents the surface tension force and is related to the density

where κ is a surface tension parameter. It is related to the surface tension σ

below. Eﬀectively, F I

is employed where γ = bρ/4. The parameter a is related to the inter-particle

pair-wise potential and b is related to the eﬀective diameter d of the particle,

and the mass m of a single particle, by b = 2πd3/3m. ψ assumes an important

role in determining phase segregation [13]. The Carnahan-Starling-van der

Waals EOS has a P

1/ρ

T curve, in which dP/dρ < 0 for certain range

of values of ρ, when the ﬂuid temperature is below its critical value. This

part of the curve represents an unstable physical situation and is the driving

mechanism responsible for keeping the phases segregated and in maintaining

a self-generated interface that is diﬀuse with a thickness of about 3-4 lattice

grid points.

The local discrete Maxwellian f eq,M

α

(ρ, −→u ) in Eq. (2) is obtained from a trun-

cated expansion in terms of ﬂuid velocity −→u of its continuous version, after

approximating it for discrete particle velocities −→eα [9]. As a result, it is a func-

tion of the ﬂuid densities and velocities and is given by

Next, we construct appropriate sets of linearly independent moments from

the distribution functions in velocity space. Since moments of the distribution

function, such as the momentum and viscous stresses, directly represent phys-

ical quantities, the moment representation oﬀers a natural and convenient way

to express the relaxation processes due to collisions. One particular advantage

of this representation is that the time scales of the various processes repre-

sented in terms of moments can be controlled independently. The moments are

constructed from the distribution function through a transformation matrix

represent kinetic energy that is independent of density and square of energy,

respectively, jx, jy and jz are the components of the momentum or mass

ﬂux (jx = ρux, jy = ρuy, jz = ρuz), qx, qy, qz are the components of the

energy ﬂux, and pxx, pxy, pyz and pzx are the components of the symmetric

traceless viscous stress tensor. The other two normal components of the viscous

stress tensor, pyy and pzz, can be constructed from pxx and pww, where pww =

pzz. The quantity mxyz is an antisymmetric third-order moment. For the

pyy −
D3Q19 model, instead of the moment mxyz, we have ﬁve additional moments:

3πxx, 3πww, mx, my and mz. The ﬁrst two of these moments have the same

symmetry as the diagonal part of the traceless viscous tensor pij, while the

last three vectors are parts of a third rank tensor, with the symmetry of

jkpmn [24].

The underlying principle for the construction of the transformation matrix is

based on the observation that the collision matrix reduces to a diagonal form

in an appropriate orthonormal basis, which is obtained by combinations of

monomials of Cartesian components of the particle velocity directions −→eα [23].

The variables s1, s4, s6 and s8 are the relaxation parameters corresponding

to the collision invariants ρ, jx, jy and jz, respectively. Since the collision

process conserves these particular moments, the choice of their corresponding

relaxation times is immaterial. This is because they are each speciﬁed to re-

lax during collisions to their local equilibrium which are actually deﬁned to be

the corresponding pre-collision value of the respective quantities in the equilib-

rium distribution f eq (see Eqs. (25) and (26)). So, whatever be the relaxation

parameters for these quantities, the collision process does not change their

18

values. The relaxation parameters for these collision invariants could be set

to zero when there is no forcing term Sα in the LBE. However, care needs to

be exercised in selecting the relaxation parameters of MRT LBE with forcing

term. This has been pointed out in Ref. [42]. This is because the collision ma-

trix also inﬂuences the forcing term in the eﬀectively explicit MRT LBE (see

Eq. (17)). To correctly obtain the continuum asymptotic limit of this LBE, i.e.

the macroscopic hydrodynamical equations for multiphase ﬂow, derived in the

next section, the relaxation times for the conserved moments should be set to

non-zero values. For simplicity, we have chosen a value of unity as the relax-

ation parameter for these moments (s1 = s4 = s6 = s8 = 1) that preserves the

inﬂuence of the second-order discretization of the source terms in Eq. (1) (see

also Ref. [34]). Furthermore, for the D3Q15 model, it will be shown through

the Chapman-Enskog analysis in Section 3 that the parameter s2 is related

to the bulk viscosity and s10 through s14 are all related to the kinematic vis-

cosity. This leaves us with s3, s5, s7, s9, and s15 as free parameters in this

model. On the other hand, for the D3Q19 model by analogy, the parameter

s2 is related to the bulk viscosity and s10, s12, s14 through s16 are each related

to the kinematic viscosity. Then, s3, s5, s7, s9, s11, s13, s17 through s19 are the

3 Macroscopic Dynamical Equations for Multiphase Flow

In this section, the macroscopic dynamical equations for the 3D MRT LBE

multiphase ﬂow model developed above will be derived by employing the

Chapman-Enskog multiscale analysis [33] for the D3Q15 velocity model. The

macroscopic equations for other 3D MRT models, such as the D3Q19 model

discussed in the previous section, can be found in an analogous way. Introduc-

The evolution equations express variations at the t0 time scale level, the dy-

namical relationships between various moments constructed from the velocity

space, their relaxation parameters and the net forces that include those that

lead to phase segregation and surface tension eﬀects and any external forces

acting on the particle populations.

Similarly, the components of the second-order equations in moment space, i.e.

Eq. (42), can be obtained. Our interest is in the dynamical equations for the

conserved moments. For brevity, here we express below only the second order

equations of the conserved moments representing variations at the t1 time

scale.

Notice that some of the relaxation parameters (s10 = s11 =

be equal to one another to maintain the isotropy of the viscous stress tensor.

From Eqs. (76) and (77), we see that the bulk and shear viscosities can be

chosen independently. In particular, this allows us to choose a bulk viscosity

larger than the shear viscosity, so that acoustic modes are attenuated quickly.

This is helpful in certain physical situations and could also aid in improving

4 3D MRT LBE Model for Multiphase Flow with Reduced Com-

pressibility Eﬀects

Multiphase LBE models based on inter-particle interactions [13] face diﬃ-

culties for ﬂuids far from the critical point and/or in the presence of external

forces [44]. This diﬃculty is related to the calculation of the inter-particle force

involving the term ∂jψ, in the model which becomes quite large across inter-

faces. As a remedy, He and co-workers [14] developed a suitable transformation

of the distribution function fα, by invoking the incompressibility condition of

the ﬂuid, to gα that determines the hydrodynamic ﬁelds, i.e. pressure and ve-

27

locity ﬁelds. A separate distribution function is also constructed to capture

the interface through an order parameter, which is diﬀerent from density. The

introduction of these features helps in reducing compressibility eﬀects in mul-

tiphase problems. In this section, we apply this idea to the 3D MRT model

discussed in Section 2. Following He et al. [14], we replace the distribution

function fα by another distribution function gα through the transformation

gα = fαRT + ψ(ρ)

By considering the ﬂuid to be incompressible, i.e.

Equations (85)-(87) are numerically more stable than the original formulation

since the term ∂jψ is multiplied by a factor proportional to the Mach number

O(Ma), instead of being O(1) when the ”incompressible” transformation is

28

not employed. As a result, this term becomes smaller in the incompressible

limit. Now, applying the transformation matrix to the above system, we get

In this new framework, we still need to introduce an order parameter to cap-

ture interfaces. Here, we employ a function φ referred to henceforth as the

index function, in place of the density as the order parameter. The evolution

equation of the distribution function, whose emergent dynamics govern the

index function, must have the term responsible for maintaining phase seg-

regation and mass conservation. In this regard, we use Eqs. (1) and (2), by

keeping the term involving ∂jψ and dropping the rest as they play no role in

mass conservation. In addition, the density is replaced by the index function

in these equations. Hence, the evolution of the distribution function for the

and φH refer to the minimum and maximum values of the index function, re-

spectively. These limits of the index function are determined from Maxwell’s

equal area construction [38] applied to the function ψ(φ) + φRT . If the viscosi-

ties are diﬀerent in diﬀerent phases, the corresponding relaxation parameters

(s11 through s14, which are equal to one another) in each phase are obtained

from Eq. (77) and their variation across interfaces are determined through a

linear interpolation similar to that for the density as shown in Eq. (95).

The numerical implementation of this MRT model is as follows: In the collision

step, the evolution of distribution functions are computed in moment space

(

f and

g) through direct relaxation of moments at rates determined by the

b

b

30

diagonal collision matrix

Λ with appropriate updates from the source terms.

After transforming the post-collision moments back to the velocity space, the

b

streaming step is performed in velocity space (f and g). After these two com-

putational steps, the various macroscopic ﬁelds are updated. This allows an

eﬃcient implementation of the MRT model for multiphase problems.

In terms of the computational memory and time resources, the MRT model

requires a negligible increase in memory and a moderate increase in compu-

tational time, when compared to the BGK model, if appropriate optimization

strategies are taken. Depending on the lattice velocity model, the transforma-

tion matrix

is either a 15

15 or 19

19 matrix. These matrices are the same

×
throughout the domain and so need not be stored at every lattice site, thus

×

T

contributing to negligible increase in memory. The corresponding relaxation

time collision matrices

Λ in moment space which are diagonal matrices with

15 or 19 elements, respectively, also do not contribute to any signiﬁcant in-

b

crease in memory requirement. The equilibrium distributions in moment space

depend only on the local macroscopic ﬁeld variables and can be computed lo-

cally without requiring additional storage. The memory requirement for the

distribution functions for the collision and streaming steps in the MRT model

is about the same as that required for the corresponding BGK version.

As noted in Ref. [24], suitable code optimization techniques should be applied

to avoid substantial increase in computational time due to the use of the MRT

model. First, direct matrix computations, which can lead to increased com-

putational overhead, should not be carried out in the transformation between

velocity and moment spaces. Instead, the transformation between the com-

ponents of the distribution functions in velocity space fα and the moments

31

fβ should be carried out explicitly using the expressions obtained from the

b
transformation matrix, which is an integer matrix with several common ele-

ments and many zeroes. In these calculations, all the common sub-expressions

should be computed just once. Second, the computational algorithm should

be carried out as discussed in the previous paragraph. With such optimization

strategies, the MRT model only incurs a moderate increase in computational

time, about 35% more than the BGK model for the cases discussed in the next

section, but with signiﬁcantly improved stability.

5 Results and Discussion

The 3D MRT model developed in the previous section will now be evaluated

for some benchmark multiphase problems. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we ex-

press the results in lattice units, i.e., the velocities are scaled by the particle

velocity c and the distance by the lattice spacing δx. We ﬁrst consider a static

multiphase problem, namely, the veriﬁcation of the well-known Laplace-Young

relation for a stationary 3D drop. This relation expresses the force balance be-

tween the excess pressure inside the drop and the surface tension force. If ∆P

is the pressure diﬀerence between the inside and outside of a drop of radius

Rd with surface tension σ, we have ∆P = 2σ/Rd.

We ﬁrst simulate this problem with a D3Q15 lattice by considering drops of

three diﬀerent radii 15, 21 and 27. The corresponding 3D domain is discretized

by 41

41

41, 61

61

61, and 81

81

81 lattice sites, respectively. Periodic

×

×

boundary conditions are considered in all directions. We simulate drops in a

gas with an equal shear kinematic viscosity of 1.0

10−2 for the gas and

×

liquid and a density ratio of 4. We have chosen equal kinematic viscosities for

32

both the phases just for simplicity. The MRT model developed in this work is

not limited to choosing only identical viscosities for both the phases. Indeed,

as noted in the previous section, when there is a viscosity mismatch, the

corresponding relaxation parameters will be diﬀerent in each phase and their

values across interfaces can be obtained by linear interpolation of viscosities

through the index function φ. It is a known limitation that the underlying

LB interfacial physical model [13,14] is stable for only low density ratios. The

MRT model has relatively little inﬂuence on this limitation. However, as will

be shown below, it can signiﬁcantly increase the stability at lower viscosities.

It may be noted that when the BGK model is employed to simulate multiphase

ﬂow with the viscosity used above, the computations become unstable. As

discussed in Section 2, we choose the relaxation parameters s1, s4, s6 and s8

to be 1.0. The parameters sα, where α = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, as shown in Eq.

(77), are obtained from the shear kinematic viscosity. On the other hand, the

bulk kinematic viscosity is related to s2 (see Eq.(76)). We consider s2 = 1.0.

Thus, the time scales for the shear and bulk viscosities are diﬀerent. The

remaining free parameters s3, s5, s7, s9 and s15, whose values have no eﬀect

on hydrodynamics, are chosen to be equal to 1.0 for simplicity.

Figure 3 shows the computed pressure diﬀerence across the drop interface as a

function of inverse drop radii for three values of the surface tension parameter:

κ = 0.08, 0.10 and 0.12. The lines correspond to a linear ﬁt for the computed

data. We ﬁnd that for these selected parameters the computed pressure dif-

ference agrees with the Laplace-Young relation prediction to within 8%. To

check the validity of the MRT lattice model with a larger velocity set, i.e. the

D3Q19 model, we performed some selected computations, which are shown

as open symbols in the same ﬁgure. The D3Q15 and D3Q19 models yield re-

sults that have negligible diﬀerence between them. Henceforth, for comparison

purposes we will only consider results obtained with the D3Q15 lattice. The

density proﬁle across the drop interface is found to be characterized well with

no anisotropic eﬀects. As with other LB models, and with methods based on

the direct solution of Navier-stokes equations for multiphase ﬂows, velocity

currents around the interfaces are observed. These are generally small and is

found to be proportional to the surface tension parameter κ.

Next, we consider a dynamical problem, namely, the oscillation of a liquid drop

immersed in a gas. We employ the analytical solution of Miller and Scriven

(1968) [46] for comparison with the computed time periods. According to

Ref. [46], the frequency of the nth mode of oscillation of a drop is given by

second mode of oscillation, i.e. n = 2, and analytical expression for the time

period Tanal is obtained from Eq. (96) through Tanal = 2π/ω2.

The initial computational setup consists of a prolate spheroid with a minimum

and maximum radii of 11 and 15, respectively, and placed in the center of a

domain discretized by 41

41

41 lattices. We consider a density ratio of 4

×

for diﬀerent values of shear viscosity and surface tension parameters. Figure 4

shows the drop conﬁgurations at diﬀerent times for ν = 1.6667

10−2 and

×

κ = 0.10. At t = 100, the drop has a prolate shape which temporarily assumes

an approximate spherical shape at t = 500. At t = 700, notice that the

drop becomes an oblate spheroid and at the longer time of t = 6000, the

drop assumes its equilibrium spherical conﬁguration. Computations are also

performed by reducing the shear viscosity by 2.5 and 5 as a function of time

from the above value, i.e. to 6.667

10−3 and 3.333

10−3. When the BGK

×

model is employed for computations of drop oscillations, it is stable only to

the point where the viscosity is lowered to ν = 1.6667

10−2. Thus, the 3D

MRT multiphase ﬂow model allows the viscosity to be lowered (or enhances

the Reynolds number) by a factor of 5 in this case as compared to the BGK

theory of dense ﬂuids [13,14].

Figure 5 shows the interface locations of the oscillating drops as a function of

when the viscosity is reduced, it takes longer for the drops to reach the equilib-

rium shape by viscous dissipation. The computed time periods of oscillations

ative error is 4.80%. Let us now decrease the surface tension parameter κ to

0.08 from 0.10. Decreasing the surface tension parameter reduces the surface

tension of the drop. As a result, it is expected that the drop would take longer

to complete a period of oscillation.

the trend with surface tension, we performed computations by increasing κ

to 0.12 from 0.10. Figure 7 shows the interface locations when κ = 0.12.

When ν = 1.6667

10−2, the computed time period is 1143, which agrees

with the analytical value within 4.60%. As this value is lower than with the

surface tension parameter of 0.1, we conclude that the computations reproduce

variations with surface tension which are consistent with expectation from the

analytical solution. The 3D MRT model is able to reproduce the time period

of oscillations within 5%.

The 3D MRT model remains as stable as in the previous cases even for more

complex dynamical problems such as when drops undergo shearing and other

types of motions. In a recent study, this model was applied to simulate col-

lision of a pair of drops under diﬀerent conditions [37]. In particular, when

employed to study oﬀ-center collisions it is able to reproduce experimentally

observed [48] complex interfacial shape changes due to such dynamical events

as shearing, rotation, stretching deformation and breakup, while maintaining

ported in Ref. [37] as much as an order of magnitude improvement in stability

was observed by the use of MRT model in lieu of the BGK model.

6 Summary and Conclusions

In this paper, we develop 3D MRT LB models for multiphase ﬂows. They

employ the LBE with a generalized collision term together with forcing terms

representing interfacial physics. By considering 3D lattice velocity models and

a second-order discretization of the forcing terms, the LBE written in terms

of the distribution function is transformed into an equivalent system repre-

sented by a set of conserved and non-conserved moments. The conserved or

hydrodynamic moments include the ﬂuid density and momentum, while the

39

non-conserved or kinetic moments include heat ﬂuxes and viscous stresses.

The models are developed such that when the collision term in the LBE is

written in moment space, the moments relax to their equilibrium values at

rates that can be adjusted independently.

By applying the Chapman-Enskog multiscale analysis to the MRT models,

we show that they correctly recover the 3D hydrodynamical equations for

multiphase ﬂows in the continuum limit. The dynamical relationships between

various moments and the forcing terms, including surface tension forces, are

systematically derived. Some of the relaxation parameters in the collision term

are shown to be related to the shear and bulk kinematic viscosities of the ﬂuid.

The ability to independently adjust the relaxation parameters enhances the

stability of the MRT models. The models are evaluated for accuracy by solving

some multiphase test problems. It is shown that the 3D MRT models verify

the Laplace-Young relation for static drops to within 8%. Computations with

MRT models of drop oscillations show that shear viscosities can be lowered by

a factor of 5 when compared to the BGK model. The computed time period

of oscillations agrees with the analytical solution to within 5%. The MRT

model, when applied to more complex multiphase problems such as binary

drop collisions, is found to be as stable as that for these simple canonical

problems. The MRT approach developed in this work can be extended to LBE

multiphase ﬂow models such as those developed in Refs. [16,17] to handle high

density ratio problems. Moreover, it also provides a more natural framework

to extend the LBE for more general situations such as viscoelastic or thermal

eﬀects in multiphase ﬂows in future investigations.

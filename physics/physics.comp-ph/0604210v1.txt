In this paper we develop a 3D Lattice-Boltzmann model that recovers in the continuous limit the
two-ﬂuids theory for plasmas, and consecuently includes the generalizated Ohm’s law. The model
reproduces the magnetic reconnection process just by given the right initial equlibrium conditions
in the magnetotail, without any assumption on the resistivity in the diﬀusive region. In this model,
the plasma is handled like two ﬂuids with an interaction term, each one with distribution functions
associated to a cubic lattice with 19 velocities (D3Q19). The electromagnetic ﬁelds are considered
like a third ﬂuid with an external force on a cubic lattice with 13 velocities (D3Q13). The model
can simulate either viscous ﬂuids in the incompressible limit or non-viscous compressible ﬂuids, and
sucessfully reproduces both the Hartmann ﬂow and the magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail.
The reconnection rate obtained with this model is R=0.109, which is in excellent agreement with
the observations.

INTRODUCTION

The magnetic reconnection is one of the most interest-
ing phenomenon of plasma physics. This process quickly
transforms the magnetic energy into termic and kinetic
energies of the plasma.
It is mostly observed inside
of astrophysical plasmas, such as solar ﬂares (where it
contributes to the plasma heating), and in the terres-
trial magnetosphere, where it support the income ﬂux of
plasma and electromagnetic energy.

The magnetic reconnection requires the existence of a
diﬀusive region, where dissipative electric ﬁelds change
the magnetic ﬁeld topology. The ﬁrst models were inde-
pendently formulated by Sweet [1], in 1958, and Parker
[2], in 1957. They suggested that the magnetic recon-
nection is a steady-state resistive process that occurs in
the vicinity of a neutral line. This model reduces the
phenomenon to a boundary condition problem and can
explain the magnetic ﬁeld reconnection. However, it has
some problems when compared with experimental obser-
vations (i.e. a very slow reconnection rate), and it leaves
In
unexplained the origin of the high-resistive region.
1964, Petschek [3] proposed the ﬁrst model for fast re-
connection rates. He included a much smaller diﬀusion
region than the Sweet-Parker model, but he suggested
that the rest of the boundary layer region should consist
of slow shock waves that accelerate the plasma up to the
Alfven velocity. Nevertheless, the origin of the diﬀusive
region remains unexplained.

At present, the nature of this phenomenon has been
studying by using kinetic theory and considering colli-
sionless plasmas, since this is a common property of as-
trophysical plasmas. One of the developments of the ki-
netic theory is the generalized Ohm’s law, where some
extra terms explain the existence of a dissipative electric
ﬁeld. The introduction of these extra terms in resistive
magnetohydrodynamics is called MHD-Hall [4]. A useful
approximation of the kinetic theory consists of modelling
the plasma like two ﬂuids (one electronic and one ionic),
which have independent momentum, mass conservation
and state equations, plus an interaction term in the mo-
mentum equation [4]. This treatment, in the one-ﬂuid
limit, introduces in a natural way the extra terms of the
generalized Ohm’s law. However, the equations involved
by this treatment are complex and it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd
an analytic solution for any problem.

For this reason, most plasma processes are studied by
numerical methods. One of the numerical methods for
simulating ﬂuids is Lattice Boltzmann (LB) [5], which
was developed from lattice-gas automata. Lattice Boltz-
mann simulations are performed on regular grids of many
cells and a small number of velocity vectors per cell, each
one associated to a density distribution function, which
evolve and spread together to the neighbohr cells accord-
ing to the collisional Boltzmann equation. The ﬁrst LB
model for studying plasmas reproduces the resistive mag-
netohydrodynamic equations and was developed by Chen
[6, 7] as an extension of the Lattice-Gas model devel-
oped by Chen and Matthaeus[8] and Chen, Matthaeus
and Klein [9]. This LB model uses 37 velocity vectors
per cell on a square lattice and is developed for two di-
mensions. Thereafter, Martinez, Chen and Matthaeuss
[10] decreased the number of velocity vectors from 37

to 13, which made easier a future 3D extension. One
of the ﬁrst LB models for magnetohydrodynamics in 3D
was developed by Bryan R. Osborn in his master thesis
[11]. He used 19 vectors on a cubic lattice for the ﬂuid,
plus 7 vectors for the magnetic ﬁeld, which makes a to-
tal number of 26 vectors per cell. By following a diﬀerent
path, Fogaccia, Benzi and Romanelli [12] introduced a 3D
LB model for simulating turbulent plasmas in the elec-
trostatic limit. All these models reproduce the resistive
magnetohydrodynamc equations for a single ﬂuid.

In this paper, we introduce a 3D Lattice-Boltzmann
model that recovers the plasma equations in the two-
ﬂuids theory. In this way, the model is able to reproduce
magnetic reconnection, without the a priori introduction
of a resistive region. Moreover, it is able to reproduce the
ﬂuid state-equation with a general polytropic coeﬃcient.
The model uses 39 vectors per cell and 63 probability
density functions (19 for each ﬂuid, 25 for the electrical
and magnetic ﬁelds). In section II we describe the model,
with the evolution rules and the equilibrium expressions
involved for the 63 density functions, plus the way to
compute the electric, magnetic and velocity ﬁelds. The
Chapman-Enskog expansion showing how these rules re-
cover the two-ﬂuids magnetohydrodynamic equations is
developed in Appendix A. In order to validate the model,
we simulate the 2D Hartmann’s ﬂow in section III, and,
ﬁnally, the magnetic reconnection for a magnetotail equi-
librium conﬁguration in section IV. The main results and
conclusions are summarized in section V.

3D LATTICE-BOLTZMANN MODEL FOR A

TWO-FLUIDS PLASMA

In a simple Lattice-Boltzmann model

[5], the D-
dimensional space is divided into a regular grid of cells.
Each cell has Q vectors ~vi that links itself with its neigh-
bors, and each vector is associated to a distribution func-
tion fi. The distribution function evolves at time steps
δt according to the Boltzmann equation,

fi(~x + ~viδt, t + δt)

fi(~x, t) = Ωi(~x, t)

,

−
where Ωi(~x, t) is a collision term, which is usually taken
as a time relaxation to some equilibrium density, f eq
.
i
This is known as the the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK)
operator [13],

(1)

where τ is the relaxation time and f eq
i (~x, t) is the equilib-
rium function. The equilibrium function is chosen in such
a way, that (in the continuum limit) the model simulates
the actual physics of the system.

For our 3D model, we use a cubic regular grid, with
lattice constant δx=√2cδt and c is the light speed
108m/s). There are 19 velocity vectors for the

For the Hartmann ﬂow [15, 16], we consider a ﬂuid
in isotermal equilibrium (γ = 1) at low temperature (a
small ξs value), incompressible and viscous. The ﬂuid
moves in the x direction between two walls at rest at
L. There is a constant magnetic ﬁeld
y=
in the y direction, with intensity B0, and a constant ex-
ternal force F =ρg in the x direction to drag the ﬂuid
[15]. So, the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds take the forms
~V =(Vx(y), 0, 0) and ~B = (Bx(y), B0, 0), respectively. By
replacing these expressions in equations (25) and (26),
one ﬁnds the following solutions for the velocity and mag-

IV. APPLICATION TO MAGNETIC
RECONNECTION

A. Dynamics of the magnetic reconnection process

In order to simulate the magnetic reconnection in the
magnetotail, we chose the initial equilibrium condition
proposed by Harris [17, 18] for the current sheet, plus
a magnetic dipole ﬁeld, ortogonal to the sheet. For this

simulation we assume that the ﬂuids are non-viscous and
compressible.

The current sheet lies on the x-y plane, and its
magnetic ﬁeld is described by the vector potential
~A=(0, Ay, 0), with

Ay(x, z) = LB0 ln cosh[v(x)(z/L)]/v(x)

,

(29)

where the eﬀective thickness of the current sheet is given
by L/v(x), and the asymptotic strength, B0, is the value
, divided by v(x). The function
of Bx in the limit z

→ ∞

v(x) is an arbitrary slowly-varying function. We choose
for v(x) the quasi-parabolic function proposed by [19, 20],

v(x) = exp(

ǫx/L)

,

−

(30)

where the parameter ǫ is much smaller than one and de-
termines the strength of the z-component of the magnetic
ﬁeld. We took ǫ=0.1 for the simulation. The initial den-
sity is the one proposed by Harris,

ns(x, z) = nb + ncv2(x) cosh−

2[v(x)(z/L)]

,

(31)

where nb is the background density and nb + nc is the
maximal density.

The magnetic dipole is set at position x0 with momen-
tum M and oriented in the z direction. It generates a

the density functions of its ﬁrst neighbohr in ortogonal

simulation region is a square of 14.26c/ω1 length (around
10300km). For this simulation we took m0=m1/100 (i.e.
an electron mass 20 times larger than the real one) in or-
der to obtain numerical stability, but it has been shown
[23] that this point does not qualitatively change the
physical results. The temperature ratio is chosen to be
T0/T1=0.2, acording to observational results [24]. For

this simulation, we took nc=5nb and nb=0.17n1.
ures 7, 8, 9 and 10 show the evolution of the magnetic
ﬁeld lines in the magnetic reconnection process. This

tion of any resistive region. The factor Ω1 is the ionic
cyclotron frequency, Ω1 = q1B0/m1. This result tell us
that the model can actually simulate the magnetic recon-
nection. This simulation took 1h in a Pentium IV PC of
2.8GHz, i.e. it is really fast.

To compute real reconnection rates we performed a
similar simulation to the one before, but with the ac-
tual ratio between electronic and ionic masses (m1=
1820m0). This choice bring us to take a shorter time
5s) and smaller cells (δx=15.95km)
steps (δt=3.76
in order to reproduce with accuracy the electron moves.
The LB array is 200
100 cells (larger in direction x),
for a total simulation region of 3190km in x and 1595km
in z. Since the region is smaller than before, v(x)=1 is a
good approximation on the entire region. The simulation
constants are L=1595km [21] and B0=10.0nT [22]. The
densities in Eq.(31) are nb=0 and nc=105m−
3 [21], the
electronic temperature is chosen as T0=5.8M K and the
ionic one as T1=23.2M K [24]. All these are observational
31kg
data. The electronic mass is taken m0=9.11
×
27kg. All other con-
and the ionic mass is m1=1.67
stants of our LB model take their standard values in IS
units.

The initial conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld is shown
in ﬁgure 11 and the same ﬁeld after t=1.92ms is shown
in ﬁgure 12. The reconnection rate we obtain from this
simulation is R=0.109, which is in good agreement with
0.1 [25]. This
the experimental observations around R
simulation took just 5 minutes in a Pentium IV PC of
2.8GHz.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we introduce a 3D lattice Boltzmann
model for simulating plasmas, which is able to simulate
magnetic reconnection without any previous assumption
of a resistive region or an anomalous resistivity. The
model simulates the plasma as two ﬂuids (one electronic
and one ionic) with an interaction term, and reproduces

in the continuous limit the equations of the two-ﬂuids
theory and, therefore, the MHD-Hall equations. This
model can simulate either conducting and viscous ﬂu-
ids in the incompressible limit or non-viscous compress-
ible ﬂuids, and sucessfully reproduces both the Hart-
mann ﬂow and the magnetic reconnection in the magne-
totail. The reconnection rate we obtain with this model
is R=0.109, which is in excellent agreement with obser-
vations.

Since this method includes both electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, plus the density and velocity ﬁelds for each ﬂuid, it
gives much more information on the details of the plasma
physics. Moreover, this opens the door to much more so-
phisticated boundary conditions, like conductive walls or
electromagnetic waves in plasmas. This is an advantage
upon other magnetohydrodynamic LB models. Further-
more, it is 3D, so many interest phenomena can be inves-
tigated here. The model does not require large compu-
tational resorces. It just takes between 5 minutes and 1h
in a Pentium IV PC of 2.8GHz and uses around 100MB
of RAM.

The model introduces the forces at ﬁrst order in time,
but this is not a problem for weak electromagnetic ﬁelds
and low resistive plasmas. If this is not the case, it is pos-
sible to modify the charge/mass ratio, but this changes
the MHD-Hall equations and slows the evolution of the
electromagnetic ﬁelds. Another way to increase the nu-
merical stability consists of modifying the model to re-
produce the two ﬂuids in a diﬀerent way: by deﬁning
density functions for the sum, f p(0)
, and the dif-
ference, q0
of the two ﬂuids. It is also
possible to develop a LB model with 13 velocity vectors
for the ﬂuids, as proposed by [26]. These are promisory
paths of future work.

Hereby we have introduced a 3D lattice Botzmann
model that reproduces the two-ﬂuid theory and includes
in a natural way many aspects of interest in plasma

physics, like electric ﬁelds and magnetic reconnection. It
has been shown in this work that this model can actually
be used to investigate real astrophysical problems. We
hope that this LB model will contribute to the study of
plasma physics in many interesting phenomena.

APPENDIX A: CHAPMAN-ENSKOG
EXPANSION

The Boltzmann equations for each ﬂuid, Eq. (8), (9)
and (10), determine the system evolution. This evolution
rule gives in the continuum limit the macroscopic diﬀer-
ential equation that the system satisﬁes. This is known as
the Chapman-Enskog expansion. To develop it, we start
by taking the Taylor expansion of these equations until
second order in spatial and temporal (δ~x, δt) variables,

and f p(2)eq
Because f p(s)eq
are now functions of ~F (s) and
ij
~J ′, we need to develop a Chapman-Enskog expansion of
the equilibrium function, too:

this equations will be recovered for all times.

Summarizing, the state equation and Eqs.

(A20),
(A24) determine the behavior of a non-viscous compress-
ible plasma.
If we use Eq.(A26) instead of Eq.(A24),
the model reproduces the behavior of an incompress-
ible plasma with viscosity. Eqs.
(A30), (A33) (A39)
and (A40) determine the evolution of the electromagnetic
ﬁelds. These are the equations of the two-ﬂuids theory
[4], and this completes the proof.

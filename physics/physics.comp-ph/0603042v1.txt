Abstract: The diﬀerential equations of Abrams and Strogatz for the
competition between two languages are compared with agent-based Monte
Carlo simulations for fully connected networks as well as for lattices in one,
two and three dimensions, with up to 109 agents.
Keywords: Monte Carlo, language competition

Many computer studies of the competition between diﬀerent languages,
triggered by Abrams and Strogatz [1], have appeared mostly in physics jour-
nals using diﬀerential equations (mean ﬁeld approximation [2, 3, 4, 5]) or
agent-based simulations for many [6, 7, 8, 9] or few [10, 11] languages. A
longer review is given in [12], a shorter one in [13]. We check in this note
to what extent the results of the mean ﬁeld approximation are conﬁrmed by
agent-based simulations with many individuals. We do not talk here about
the learning of languages [14, 15].

The Abrams-Strogatz diﬀerential equation for the competition of a lan-
guage Y with higher social status 1 − s against another language X with
lower social status s is

dx/dt = (1 − x)xas − x(1 − x)a(1 − s)

(1)

where a ≃ 1.3 [1] and 0 < s ≤ 1/2. Here x is the fraction in the population
speaking language X with lower social status s while the fraction 1−x speaks
language Y. As initial condition we consider the situation in which both
languages have the same number of speakers, x(t = 0) = 1/2. Figure 1
shows exponential decay for a = 1.31 as well as for the simpler linear case
a = 1. For s = 1/2 the symmetric situation x = 1/2 is a stationary solution

which is stable for a < 1 and unstable for a > 1. From now on we use a = 1.
This simpliﬁcation makes the resulting diﬀerential equation

dx/dt = (2s − 1)(1 − x)x

(2)

for s 6= 1/2 similar to the logistic equation which was applied to languages
before, as reviewed by [16]. For s = 1/2 any value of x is a marginally stable
stationary solution.

This diﬀerential equation is a mean-ﬁeld approximation, ignoring the fate
of individuals and the resulting ﬂuctuations. We now put in N individuals
which in the fully connected model feel the inﬂuence of all individuals, while
on the d-dimensional lattice they feel only the inﬂuence of their 2d nearest
neighbors. The probability p to switch from language Y to language X, and
the probability q for the inverse switch, are

p = xas,

q = (1 − x)a(1 − s)

.

Figure 2: Fully connected model with 103, 106, 109 agents at s = 0.4
compared with diﬀerential equation (rightmost line) at s = 0.4. The three
left lines correspond to s = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 from left to right for N = 109. The
thick horizontal line corresponds to s = 0.5 and N = 106 and changes away
from 1/2 only for much longer times. Figs. 2 and 3 use one sample only
and thus indicate self-averaging: The ﬂuctuations decrease for increasing
population.

On a lattice, this x is replaced by the fraction of X speakers in the neighbor-
hood of 2d sites. We use regular updating for most of the results shown in
this paper. Initially each person selects randomly one of the two languages
with equal probability: x(t = 0) = 0.5. In the symmetric situation s = 1/2
with a = 1 that we will consider, our later lattice model becomes similar to
the voter model [17].

Fig.2 shows our results for the fully connected case and Fig.3 for the
square lattice with four neighbours; the results are quite similar to each
other and to the original diﬀerential equation. A major diﬀerence with the
diﬀerential equation (1) is seen in the symmetric case s = 1/2 when the two

languages are completely equivalent. Then the diﬀerential equation has x
staying at 1/2 for all times, while random ﬂuctuation for ﬁnite population
destabilize this situation and let one of the two languages win over the other,
with x going to zero or unity.

This latter case can be described in a uniﬁed way by looking at the num-
ber of lattice neighbours speaking a language diﬀerent from the center site.

by an exponential decay in d = 1, 3 as in two dimensions, Fig.5. Figure 6

shows that the average of |x(t) − 1/2| increases in two dimensions roughly
as the square-root of time until it saturates at 1/2, indicating random walk
(Note that ﬁrst averaging over x and then taking the absolute
behavior.
value | < x > −1/2| would not give appropriate results since < x > would
always be 1/2 apart from ﬂuctuations.)

In all the simulations described above, we went through the population
regularly, like a typewriter on a square lattice, and for full connectivity kept
the probabilities constant within each iteration. Using random updating is
more realistic but takes more time. The long-time results are similar, and the
power-law decay holds for t < 102 with exponents 0.5 for d = 1 (Fig. 5), and
0.1 (compatible with 1/ ln t) for d = 2. For d = 3 a plateau is also reached.
For the simpler regular updating we checked when the fraction x, initially
1/2, leaves the interval from 0.4 to 0.6 on its way to zero or one, Fig.7a. For

5

the random updating we checked when the energy reaches a small fraction of
its initial value, taken as 2/L, 0.04 and 0.6 for d = 1, 2, 3, Fig.7. Both ﬁgure
parts are quite similar, with scaling laws for the characteristic time which are
compatible with the ones obtained for a voter model [17]: τ ≃ N 2 in d = 1,
τ ≃ N ln N in d = 2, and τ ≃ N in d = 3, where N = Ld.

We conclude that agent-based simulations diﬀer appreciably from the
results from the mean-ﬁeld approach for the symmetric case s = 1/2: While
Eqs.(1,2) then predict x to stay at x = 1/2, our simulations in Fig.4 and
later show that after a decay everybody speaks the same language.
In a
fully connected network and in d = 3 the decay is triggered by a ﬁnite size
ﬂuctuation, while in d = 1, 2 the intrinsic dynamics of the system causes an
initial ordering phenomena in which spatial domains of speakers of the same
language grow in size.

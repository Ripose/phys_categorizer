High Level Trigger Using ALICE ITS Detector

A. K. Mohanty

CERN, CH-1211, Geneva 23, Switzerland

Abstract

The high PT trigger capabilities of the ALICE inner tracking system (ITS)

as a standalone detector have been investigated. Since the high PT charged

particles mostly lead to the linear trajectories within this ITS sector, it is

possible to select tracks of PT of the order of 2 GeV and above by conﬁning

to a narrow search window in the (θ, φ) space. Also shown that by perform-

ing a principal component transformation, it is possible to rotate from a 12

dimensional (θ-φ) space (in this space, a good ITS track has 6 pairs of hit

co-ordinates) into a parametric space characterized by only two independent

components when the track momentum exceeds a particular limit. This in-

dependent component analysis (ICA) has been uitilised further to reduce the

false track contribution to an acceptable level particularly when the charged

multiplicity is large. Finally, it is shown that with a narrow bin width of

∆θ = ∆φ

0.008 radian and with PCA or ICA cut, the ITS can be used to

∼

trigger the jet particles with PT

2 GeV. Apart from triggering these high

≥

PT particles, this method can also be used to estimate the initial momentum

of the high PT tracks for seeding which can be further prolonged into the

TPC detector both for oﬄine and online Kalman tracking or even to detect

those high PT tracks of rare events which might get lost in the TPC-TRD

dead zone.

I. INTRODUCTION

ALICE (A Large ION Collider Experiment) has a dedicated detector systems to study

the collective properties of the hot and dense matter created in nucleus-nucleus collisions

using the CERN large hadron collider (LHC) in the year

2007. The ALICE detectors will

∼

measure and identify mid-rapidity hadrons, leptons and photons produced in the interactions

[1]. The design parameters of the ALICE detectors are optimized to cope with multiplicities

up to 8000 charged particles per unity rapidity (the theoretical prediction of dNch/dη at mid-

rapidity for PbPb collison at √s = 5.5 A TeV may lie between 2000 and 6000), resulting

in 20000 charged primary and secondary tracks in the acceptance of the central detector

systems that covers mid-rapidity

0.9

0.9 and full azimuth. Based on current

−

η

≤

≤

physics simulations, the central event size in Pb-Pb interaction is expected to be about

86 MB before compression out of which about 75 MB of raw data is generated by the time

projection chamber (TPC), which is the main tracking device of the ALICE detector (A brief

description of the ALICE detector systems is given in the appendix and also can be found

in ALICE PPR [1] and reference therein). Several data compression algorithms have been

tried on simulated TPC data [2]. Using Huﬀman compression and an optimized frequency

distributioni we have also shown that it is possible to achieve a lossless compression ratio

of

50% on the realistic TPC rawdata that includes read out overheads [3,4]. An estimate

∼

of the total bandwidth needed for the data transfer requires evaluation of the rawdata

throughput for each type of trigger. The number of events required to accumulate enough

statistics in one year period of data taking (which has an eﬀective time of 106 s) is a few

106 events for hadronic physics, a few 107 events for minimum bias, hadronic charm and

electron physics and at least 109 for dimuon physics. The needed rates are then of the order

of a few Hz for hadronic physics, a few tens of Hz for minimum bias, hadronic charm and

elctrons and a few hundreds of Hz for dimuons for the L2 triggers. At a read out frequency

of 200 Hz, a total band width of

15 GB/s coming out of the detector has to be handled

∼

2

(This rate roughly coincides with the TPC limitation 1).

Thus, the amount of data which needs to be written to mass storage will be about a

few PBytes per year. One of the major objective of the ALICE experiment is to measure

rare processes such as jet transverse energy spectra up to ET

200 GeV and the pattern

∼

of medium induced modiﬁcations of charmonium and bottomium bound states. These low

cross section rare events (which range down to one in 107 pp and to one in 104 PbPb events),

require full exploitation of all the available luminosity in order to attain the desired event

statistics and will generate data volume which will far exceed what can be tarnsferred to

the permanent storage system. ALICE would not be able to acquire suﬃcient statistics for

many rare probes without rejecting many unwanted events by sharpening the momentum

cut through a high level trigger (HLT) mechanism. Therefore, the HLT system is one of

the important aspect of the ALICE detectors which controls the data ﬂow between the

front end electronics of the detectors and the event builder of the data acquisition system.

Using simulated rawdata, all the present HLT studies examine the possibility of having a

fast cluster ﬁnder (using techniques like Hough transformation etc) leading to a fast pattern

recognition algorithm primarily for the tracks in the TPC sectors [5,6]. In this work, we

consider the possibility of generating a high PT trigger using the hit informations only from

the ITS sectors of the ALICE detectors where all high PT charged particle tarjectories are

mostly linear. As will be shown later, using a simple road-ﬁnder algorithm based on a narrow

(θ, φ) search window, it has been possible to reject signiﬁcant amount of low PT backgrounds.

1At an average luminosity of 1027 cm−2 s−1, the minimum bias rate (assuming 8 barn total cross

section) for PbPb collison is 8 KHz out of which 1 KHz may be considered as central events. At

this event rate, (f = 8000 events/s), and with drift time τ = 90 µs, the fraction of PbPb double

events in the TPC is [1

exp(

2τdrif t f )] = 0.76, where 2τ accounts for the past and present

−

−

memory of the TPC. The clean minimum bias PbPb events thus reduces to about 1900 Hz and

the central rate to about 240 Hz.

3

It has been possible to extract the momentum of these tracklets through a χ2 minimization

procedure which agree well (within 20%) with the actual momentum. The computation is

also fast enough as the track density is very low within a small ∆θ = ∆φ bin of

0.008

∼

radian, thus reducing the number of combinatorics. Further, it is found that with proper

choice of the input track co-ordiates (A track is represented by a 12-dimensional hit vector

in θ, φ space), a principal component transformation can be carried out which leads to a

parametric space with only two independent variables when the track momentum becomes

large so that all the trajectories are nearly linear. This aspect has been utilised further

to reject the false tracks particularly when the track density is very high. It is shown in

this work that this simple road ﬁnder with a PCA or ICA cut can be used to reject low

momentum tracks and select PT

2 GeV quite eﬃciently with less computational eﬀorts.

≥

This has been demonstrated using Hijing generator with jet options [1]. In addition, since

the extracted momentum is close to the true value within 20%, it can also be used as a seed

ﬁnder for high PT tracks which can be further prolonged into the TPC using Kalman ﬁlter

technique or even, ITS as a stand-alone detector, can also be used to know the origin of a

high PT track which might otherwsise gets lost in the TPC-TRD dead zones.

II. ITS DETECTOR AND ALIROOT SIMULATION

The Inner Tracking System (ITS) consists of 6 cylindrical layers of silicon detectors,

located at radii, r = 4, 7, 15, 24, 39 and 44 cm. It covers the rapidity range of

η

< 0.9 for

|
1σ), i.e. 10.6 cm along

|

±

all vertices located within the length of the interaction diamond (

the beam direction. The number, position and segmentation of the layers are optimized

for eﬃcient track ﬁnding and high impact parameter resolution.

In particular, the outer

radius is determined by the necessity to match tracks with those from the Time Projection

Chamber (TPC), and the inner radius is the minimum allowed by the radius of the beam pipe

(3cm). The ﬁrst layer has a more extended coverage (
|

η

|

< 1.98) to provide, together with the

Forward Multiplicity Detector (FMD), a continuous coverage in rapidity for the measurement

4

of charged particles multiplicity. Because of high particle density, pixel detectors have been

chosen for the inner most two layers, and silicon drift detectors for the following two layers.

The outer two layers have double sided silicon microstrip detectors. With the exception

of inner most pixel layers, all others layers will also provide energy loss information in the

non-relativistic region. Thus, the ITS has a stand-alone capability as a low PT particle

spectrometer.

The simulation is carried out using AliRoot, the standard ALICE simulation and recon-

struction package based on the ROOT object oriented data analysis framework [7]. We use

Hijing generator for background simulation. Although, analysis is conﬁned only to the ITS

sector, we include all the ALICE detectors and passive materials in AliRoot simulation with

the option of magnetic ﬁled B = 0.5 T in the solenoidal region. In the present work, we

use a fast simulator to get reconstructed points (recpoints) from the hits. We also neglect

the vertx smearing and set vertices to (0, 0, 0) for all the tracks in the AliRoot simulation.

We consider only those tracks which have hits in all the six ITS layers. To minimize the

dispersion, we begin with all the reconstructed points in the 4th layer with a given (θ, φ)

and look for the corresponding points in the remaining ﬁve layers within a search window

of θ

∆θ and φ

∆φ. The (θ, φ) co-ordinate in the 4th layer is considered to be the seed

±

±

for a good track candidate if it has entries in all the follwing and subsequent layers within

that search window. Therefore, the eﬃciency (ǫ) is deﬁned as the ratio of good tracks (as

deﬁned above) divided by the total number of seeds or the reconstructed points in the 4th

layer. Since, we have considered only those tracks which have entries in all six layers, the

total number of rec-points in the 4th layer also corresponds to the total number of tracks or

trcaklets that pass through the ITS.

FIG. 1. The eﬃciency ǫ as a function of bin width (∆θ = ∆φ) in radian at diﬀerent PT . For

detail see the text.

Figure 1 shows the eﬃciency ǫ as a function of (θ, φ) bin width for diﬀerent PT . As can

be seen from the ﬁgure, at a bin width of

0.008 radian, it is possible to reject most of the

∼

low PT tracks below 1.5 or 2.0 GeV. For this plot, we have considered only 2000 charged

pions generated randomly at a ﬁxed PT within the full ITS acceptance. We have also taken

∆φ = ∆θ, although the spread in θ direction is slightly smaller than the φ dispersion and

can be optimized further. However, the choice of ∆φ = ∆θ only increases the number of

combinatorics marginally and does not aﬀect the analysis. Within this (θ, φ) window, we

consider all the combinatorics and extract the radius of curvature (R) by a simple curvature

ﬁtting and by accepting the one for which the χ2 is minimum. Finally, we estimated the

momentum (in GeV) from the relation PT = .002998 B R.

To see how well we can reconstruct the transverse momentum by only a χ2 minimization,

we generate charged pions between 0 to 10 GeV. However, this time, we chose N = 4800, but

6

restrict to only

< 0.3 over full azimuth so that the data volume is not too high and also

η

|

|

the number of primaries chosen corresponds to dN/dη

8000. If the ﬁtted value of PT is

≈

within 20% of the true PT , we consider the estimate as true. Otherwise, it is a false estimate

although the estimated χ2 is still a minimum. Figure 2 shows the plot of number of true

and false tracks as deﬁned above as a function of PT for three diﬀerent bin widths of 0.008,

0.010 and 0.015 radians respectively. Although the original PT distribution is uniform, the

extracted momentum distribution shows non-uniformity due to poor momentum resolution.

Note that for PT > 2 GeV, the contribution of the false tracks remain below 10%. However, it

is not possible to extract PT below 2 GeV as the false estimate increases sharply particularly

when bin width increases.

It is also noticed that the contributions of the true estimates

depend on the bin width to some extent. For larger bin width, the contribution of the

true estimate decrases while the false estimate goes up at low momentum below PT < 2

GeV. Similarly, if the bin width is too small, some of the high PT tracks may get rejected.

Therefore, it is very crucial to use proper bin width. However, as will be shown below, the

dependency on the bin width can be reduced by incorporating additional techniques like

principal component or independent component analysis.

III. INDEPENDENT COMPONENT AS A HIGH PASS FILTER:

For multivariate data analysis, suitable representation is often sought as a linear trans-

formation of the original data into a lower dimensional parametric space. Well known linear

transformation methods are principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis, and pro-

jection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is relatively a recently developed

method in which the goal is to ﬁnd a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the

components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a represen-

tation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including

feature extraction and signal separation [8]. Basically, two random variables y1 and y2 are

said to be independent if information on the value of y1 does not give any information on

the value of y2, and vice versa. Mathematically, if y1 and y2 are said to be independent if

8

h
and only if the joint probability distribution function (pdf) is factorizable so that

p(y1, y2) = p1(y1)p2(y2).

This deﬁnition extends naturally for any number of n random variables, in which case the

joint pdf must be a product of n terms. Therefore, given any two functions f1 and f2, the

independent random variables should have the property

E[f1(y1)f2(y2)] = E[f(y1)]E[f2(y2)],

where E stands for an average. A weaker form of independence is uncorrelatedness. Two

random variables are said to be uncorrelated if their covariance is zero:

E[y1y2] = E[y1]E[y2].

Thus, if the variables are independent, they are also unclorrelated. On the otherhand,

uncorrelatedness does not imply independence for non-Gaussian random variables. There are

many ICA techniques that lead to independent estimation of the parameters in the feature

space. Common to all ICA analysis is the PCA transformation which is generally used as a

ﬁrst step to achieve uncorrelatedness. However, in the present application, we will show that

by choosing the proper input parameter space, it is possible to achive independence only

through a PCA transformation although the input variables are known to be non-Gaussian.

The principal component analysis does a simple co-ordinate transformation to principal

axes such that the variances of the new co-ordinates are equal to the eigen values of the

covariance matrix, which is generated out of a large sample space [9,10]. We consider only the

ITS layers and a single track is chracterized by a M-dimensional hit vector h = (h1, h2..., hM )

Therefore, the PCA is tuned with a training data set in order to calculate the average and

from each layer when a charged particle enters the ITS detector. We consider all possible

combinations C = (C1, C2, ..., CM ) and estimate the generalized distance:

FIG. 3. The eﬃciency as a function of PT . The good tracks are those for which the generalized

distance d in (θ, φ) space is less than dmax = 4.0. The diﬀerent curves correspond to training set

generated at diﬀerent PT as shown in ﬁgure caption.

In the following, we carry out the PCA test with diﬀerent training set. As in ﬁgure 1, we

generate 2000 charged pions at diﬀerent PT . First, we consider a hit vector in (θ, φ) space

for which M = 12 as a good ITS track has 6 pairs of (θ, φ) coordiantes. Figure 3 shows the

plot of eﬃciency of accepting good tracks after a PCA cut as a function of PT . As in ﬁgure

1, here the eﬃciency is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of track candidates for which

dmax = 4.0 to the total number of good tracks N. The PCA is tuned with training data

set generated at diﬀerent PT . The symbols in ﬁgure 3 show the PCA eﬃciency when the

training set is chosen at diﬀerent PT . It is interesting to note that when the PCA is tuned

with the training data set at PT = 0.8 GeV, all track candidates above PT > 0.8 GeV pass

the PCA test (see the ﬁlled circle). However, if the PCA is tuned with a training set at

higher momentum, say PT = 9 GeV (see open traingles), then most of the low PT tracks,

do not pass the PCA test. This is an interesting property which can be utilised to reduce

11

the tracks of low PT momentum by appropriate choice of the training data set.

FIG. 4. The eﬃciency as a function of PT . The good tracks are those for which the generalized

We ahve also carried out similar exercise by considering a hit vector in (x, y, z) co-

ordinates. Figure 4 shows the corresponding plot as that of ﬁgure 3. However, with the

choice of the cartesian co-ordinates, PCA does not have any discriminating power. This

aspect can be understood if we examine the number of independent variables which can be

obtained through a PCA transformation. Figure 5 shows the plot of number of independent

variables ( out of 12 η2, we consider only those variable whose values are signiﬁcant and

are above a given threshold) as a function of PT . Notice that as PT increases, the number

of independent variables reduces to two which is a characteristic of all straight trajectories

which can be described by only two independent variables. Such behaviour we do not ﬁnd,

if the input variables are chosen from the cartesian space. Therefore, PCA transformation

in (θ, φ) space is nearly equivalent to an ICA transformation and can be used as a high pass

ﬁlter for high PT tracks.

IV. ROAD FINDER WITH PCA

In the follwoing, we consider the road ﬁnder with the combined action of PCA and χ2

minimization. The steps are as follows: (a) First, we consider all the reconstructed points in

the 4th layer. Starting with a given (θ, φ), we pick up all the points in the remaining 5 layers

within a search window of θ

∆θ and φ

∆φ. (b) Second, we consider all the combinatorics

±

and accept those which qualify a PCA test with d

4.0. The PCA parameters are tuned

≤

with a training set generated at PT = 3.0 GeV 2. (c) Next, we extract the best radius

parameter (R) through a minimum χ2 curvature ﬁtting. Therefore, at this stage, only one

combination is retained for which the χ2 is minimum. Finally, the PT (in GeV) is extracted

2 GeV can be

rejected.

13

through the relation PT = 0.002998 B R where B = 0.5 T . As in ﬁgure 2, ﬁgures (6

8)

−

now show the contributions of true and false estimates at diﬀerent track densities both with

(steps a, b and c) and without PCA cut (steps a and c). With inclusion of PCA, the true

estimates become independent of bin widths as can be seen prominently in ﬁgure 8 where

the track density is very high. This is an attractive feature as we need not optimize too

much on the bin width as long as it is close too 0.008 radian or higher. Although, slight

higher in bin width increases the number of combinatorics, it still safer to allow little larger

width so that we do not loose too much low PT tracks. Another important aspect of the

inclusion of PCA test is that the false PT estimation below 2 GeV reduces drastically. In

short, with a PCA cut (d

4.0) and a bin width of

0.008 radian, it is possible to extract

≤

∼

most of the high PT tracks above 2 GeV with good eﬃciency.

options. These PT distribution corresponds to the simulated PT of the rec-points found only

at the 4th layer. For the present purpose, we may consider it as a respresentation of the track

density distribution inside the ITS. Figure 10 shows the PT distribution which is obtained

after the HLT cut as discussed before with a bin width of 0.008 radian and dmax = 4.0. Note

that in ﬁgure 10, we have only ploted those tracks having a PT > 2 GeV obtained using the

HLT algorithm as discussed before. These tracks are mostly due to the jet events.

FIG. 9. The PT distribution of recpoints of ITS 4th layer simulated using hijing event generator

with jet option. Here, the bin widths are ∆η = 0.25 and ∆θ = 0.1 respectively. This is the typical

jet-cone width. Again, these widths are used only for bining in the plot. Note that this width is

diﬀerent from the bin width of 0.008 radian used in the HLT road ﬁnder algorithm.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this report, it is shown that the Innner Tracking System (ITS) of ALICE detector can

be used for triggering high PT particles as stand-alone device. The seed for the trigger road

can be selected some where from the middle layer in order to have minimum dispersion both

in θ and φ directions. It is found that most of the background low PT tracks can be rejected

by conﬁning the search window to a narrow bin width of ∆θ = ∆φ = 0.008 radian. In order

to estimate the transverse momentum, it is required to consider all the combinatorics inside

17

a given search window which may go up when the track multiplicity is high. However, it

is shown that the number many false combinatorics can be reduced to an acceptable levels

through a PCA test followed by a least square minimization. Using Hijing event generator,

it is shown here that the ITS can be used to trigger charged particles for PT above 2 GeV

or more. The proposed HLT algorithm with ITS can be used to trigger high PT jet particles

with good eﬃciency.

APPENDIX: A

The ALICE detector consists of a central detector system, covering mid-rapidity (
|

| ≤
0.9) over the full azimuth, and several forward systems. The central system includes, from

η

the interaction vertex to the outside, six layers of high resolution silicon detectors (Inner

Tracking System-ITS), a Time projection Chamber (TPC)-the main tracking device of the

experiment, a transition radiation detector for electron identiﬁcation (TRD), and a particle

identiﬁcation array (Time Of Flight-TOF). The central system which is installed inside

a large soleniodal magnet with ﬁeld of

0.5 T also includes an ring imaging Cherenkov

particle (High Momentum Particle Identiﬁcation Detector HMPID), and an electromagnetic

the opposite side), an ensemble of multiplicity detectors (FMD) in the forward rapidity

region (up to η = 5.1). A system of scintillators and quartz counters (T0 and V0) will

provide fast trigger signals, and two sets of neutron and hadron calorimeter, located at 0o

and about 90 m away from the interaction vertex, will measure the impact parameter (Zero

Degree Calorimeter-ZDC). An absorber positioned very close to the vertex shields the muon

spectrometer. The muon spectrometer consists of a dipole magnet, ﬁve tracking stations,

an iron wall (muon ﬁlter) to absorb remaining hadrons, and two trigger stations behind the

18

muon ﬁlter.

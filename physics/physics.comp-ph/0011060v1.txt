Abstract

In this work we compare two diﬀerent approaches to calculation of the three-body
resonances on the basis of Faddeev diﬀerential equations. The ﬁrst one is the com-
plex scaling approach. The second method is based on an immediate calculation of
resonances as zeros of the three-body scattering matrix continued to the physical
sheet.

Key words: three-body systems, complex scaling, resonances

1 Introduction

The complex scaling method [1,2] invented in early 70-s remains one of the
most eﬀective approaches to calculation of resonances in few-body systems.
This method is applicable to an N-body problem in the case where inter-
particle interaction potentials are analytic functions of coordinates. The com-
plex scaling gives a possibility to rotate the continuous spectrum of an N-body
Hamiltonian in such a way that certain sectors of unphysical sheets neighbor-
ing the physical one turn into a part of the physical sheet for the resulting
non-selfadjoint operator. Resonances appear to be complex eigenvalues of this
operator [1,2] while the binding energies stay ﬁxed during the scaling trans-
formations. Therefore, when searching for the resonances within the complex
scaling approach one may apply the methods which are usually employed to
locate the binding energies. Some reviews of the literature on the complex
scaling and its many applications can be found, in particular, in [4–6]. Here

we only mention that there is a rigorous mathematical proof [3] that for a
rather wide class of interaction potentials the resonances given by the com-
plex scaling method coincide with the “true scattering resonances”, i. e. the
poles of the analytically continued scattering matrix in the unphysical sheets.

Along with the complex scaling, various diﬀerent methods are also used for
calculations of the resonances. Among the methods developed to calculate
directly the scattering-matrix resonances we, ﬁrst, mention the approach based
on the momentum space Faddeev integral equations [7,8] (see, e. g., Ref. [9] and
references cited therein). In this approach one numerically solves the equations
continued into an unphysical sheet and, thus, the three-body resonances arise
as the poles of the continued T-matrix. Another approach to calculation of the
scattering-matrix resonances is based on the explicit representations [10,11] for
the analytically continued T- and S-matrices in terms of the physical sheet.
From these representations one infers that the three-body resonances can be
found as zeros of certain truncations of the scattering matrix only taken in
the physical sheet. Such an approach can be employed even in the coordinate
space [11,12].

To the best of our knowledge there are no published works applying the com-
plex scaling to the Faddeev equations. Therefore, we consider the present
investigation as a ﬁrst attempt undertaken in this direction. However, the pur-
pose of our work is rather two-fold. On the one hand, we make the complex
scaling of the Faddeev diﬀerential equations. On the other hand we compare
the complex scaling method with the scattering-matrix approach suggested
in [11,12]. We do this making use of both the approaches to examine reso-
nances in a model system of three bosons having the nucleon masses and in
the three-nucleon (nnp) system itself.

which are assumed to depend on xα =

where HF (θ) is the non-selfadjoint operator resulting from the complex-scaling

not, of course, depend on the scaling parameter θ and on the choice of the
terms f (l)(x, y).

The resonances are looked for as zeroes of the truncated scattering-matrix (see
[12] for details) s0(z) = 1 + 2ia0(z), where the (1 + 1

amplitude a0(z) for complex energies z in the physical sheet is extracted from
the asymptotics (6).

For numerical solution of the boundary-value problem (3 – 6) we employ its
ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation in the hyperradius-hyperangle coordinates. A
detail description of the ﬁnite-diﬀerence algorithm used can be found in Ref.
[13].

3 Results

In the table we present our results obtained for a complex-scaling resonance
in the model three-body system which consists of identical bosons having the
nucleon mass. To describe interaction between them we employ a Gauss-type
potential of Ref. [12]

1 for L = 0 and l = 0 only taken into account. In the present
[Q(θ, z)]−
calculation we have taken up to 400 knots in both hyperradius and hyper-
angle variables while for the cut-oﬀ hyperradius we take 40 fm. One observes
from the table that the position of the resonance depends very weakly on
the scaling parameter θ which conﬁrms a good numerical quality of our re-
sults. We compare the resonance values of the table to the resonance value

We also watched the trajectory of the above resonance when the barrier ampli-
tude Vb varied (see. Fig. 1). While the complex scaling method was applicable
it gave practically the same positions for the resonance. For the barrier ampli-
tudes Vb smaller than 1.0 only the scattering-matrix approach allows to locate
the resonance (which ﬁnally, for Vb < 0.85, turns into a virtual level).

As to the nnp system in the S – state where we employed the MT I–III [14]
potential model, both the methods applied give no resonances on the two-
body unphysical sheet (see [12]). Moreover, we have found no resonances in
the part of the three-body sheet accessible via the complex scaling method.
Thus, at least in the framework of the MT I–III model we can not conﬁrm the
0.15) MeV
experimental result of Ref. [16] in which the point
was interpreted as a resonance corresponding to an exited state of the triton
3H.

The triton virtual state can be only calculated within the scattering-matrix
method but not in the scaling approach. Our present improved scattering-
2.690 MeV (i. e. the virtual level
matrix result for the triton virtual state is
lies 0.47 MeV below the two-body threshold). This result has been obtained
with the MT I-III potential on a grid having 1000 knots in both hyperradial

and hyperradial variables and with the value of cut-oﬀ hyperradius equal to
120 fm. Notice that some values for the virtual-state energy obtained by dif-
ferent authors can be found in [9] and all of these values are about 0.5 MeV
below the two-body threshold.

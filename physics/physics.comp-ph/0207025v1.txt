Application of Pad´e interpolation to stationary state problems

If the small and large coupling behavior of a physical system can be computed
perturbatively and expressed respectively as power series in a coupling parameter
g and 1/g, a Pad´e approximant embracing the two series can interpolate between
these two limits and provide an accurate estimate of the system’s behavior in the
generally intractable intermediate coupling regime. The methodology and validity
of this approach is illustrated by considering several stationary state problems in
quantum mechanics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

|

x

A Pad´e approximation is a formal transformation of the ﬁrst n terms in the power series
for a function f (x) into a rational function. The rational function R(x), known as the
Pad´e approximant, typically comprises a ratio of two polynomials of x, chosen in a way
that a Taylor expansion of R(x) completely reproduces the original power series up to
order n.
In contrast to the truncated “mother” series, the Pad´e approximant is able to
maintain remarkable ﬁdelity to the true f (x) for values of x well beyond the radius of
convergence of the original power series, although how accurate it is, or how large
may
be before the approximation fails is impossible to establish in general. Nevertheless, its
extraordinary predictive power has in the past been exploited in areas of quantum ﬁeld
theory and statistical physics. In quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics,
for example, the Pad´e method has been shown to be an eﬀective means of both estimating
unknown higher order terms as well as of summing the perturbation series for a physical
observable that has been calculated to some ﬁnite order in the coupling constant.1

In a recent paper,2 one of us has explored a diﬀerent usage of the Pad´e approximation in
which the Pad´e approximant, constructed from the truncated power series of f (x) about two
diﬀerent points, serves to interpolate f (x) between the two points of expansion. In particular,
if one is able to compute perturbatively both the small x and large x behavior of f (x)
(x > 0), and express them respectively in a power series in x and 1/x, a Pad´e approximant
that simultaneously satisﬁes the two perturbation series will provide an accurate estimation
of f (x) for the entire range of x, provided that f (x) is a suﬃciently smooth function in
this range. This approach is known as the two-point Pad´e approximation,3 and is especially
savoring from the perspective of duality in supersymmetric gauge theories;4 if one can infer
perturbatively the strong coupling behavior of a theory from its weakly coupled dual theory,
a Pad´e interpolation of this limit with the perturbative weak coupling limit of the original
theory will then give us a handle on the behavior of the theory for all coupling strengths.

The Pad´e interpolation method may also be employed in some cases where there are
no obvious expansion parameters. An example is a system for which the Hamiltonian H,

although itself not exactly soluble, can be expressed as a sum of two constituent Hamilto-
nians, H1 and H2, both with known exact solutions.
It was proposed in Ref. 2 that, by
tagging either H1 or H2 with an interpolation parameter λ, the two required perturbative
series in opposite limits of λ could be generated, and an estimate for H would correspond to
evaluating the Pad´e approximant with λ = 1. This method was applied in Ref. 2 to heavy
quarkonium systems with reasonable success.

The quarkonium example demonstrates the power and usefulness of Pad´e interpolation
for treating a certain class of stationary state problems. The technique may serve as an
improvement or a supplement to perturbation theory typically taught in courses on quantum
mechanics. The purpose of this note is to present a pedagogical discourse of the methodology
of Pad´e interpolation. For the examples considered below, the Pad´e interpolation method
is shown to be stable to higher orders, and yield particularly good results when the usual
perturbative method fails.

Consider a system governed by a Hamiltonian H that has no known solution, but which
may be expressed as a sum of two parts: H = H1 + H2, where H1 and H2 are individually
exactly soluble. We are interested in ﬁnding the spectrum of H. In order to implement the
Pad´e interpolation for this purpose, we introduce the interpolation Hamiltonian

II. THE METHOD

H(λ)

where the interpolation parameter λ is real and positive. Suppose ﬁrst that λ
1. We may
then regard H2 as a perturbation, and calculate the eigenvalues of H as power series in λ
(the subscript j labels the eigenvalues):

≪

E<

j (λ) = c0 + c1λ + c2λ2 + . . . + cmλm .

In the opposite λ

1 limit, we rewrite Eq. (1) as

≫

and a second perturbative solution of H(λ) follows from treating 1/λ as a small parameter:

Note that both H1 and H2 must admit stationary states and be able to be treated as
perturbations for the method to work. An example of a Hamiltonian that admits bound-
state solutions but that cannot be treated as a perturbation is the Hamiltonian for an inﬁnite
rectangular potential well.

A generic Pad´e approximant for the energy eigenvalues has the form

where the N +M +1 coeﬃcients are determined by matching order by order the power series
expansion of the Pad´e approximant with the perturbative results. For b0
= 0, the nature
of E>
j (λ) in Eq. (4) demands that the polynomials in the numerator and the denominator
of the Pad´e approximant diﬀer by one degree such that M = N
1. Furthermore, suppose
that we solve H(λ) for small and large λ to the same order in perturbation theory, that is,
m = n. (This case is just an illustration and is not a necessary condition for implementing
the Pad´e interpolation, although the accuracy of the approximation will depend on m and n.)
Then Eqs. (2) and (4) together furnish 2n + 2 simultaneous equations for the 2N unknown
coeﬃcients p and q, and consequently the polynomials in the Pad´e approximant must satisfy
N = n + 1 and M = n. The ﬁnal step of setting λ = 1 in the Pad´e approximant yields an
estimate for the eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian H.

We demonstrate here the validity of the Pad´e interpolation method by way of two exam-

ples. Consider ﬁrst a simple two-state system described by the Hamiltonian

where a and b are real parameters, and σy and σz are the Pauli matrices. For example,
this Hamiltonian can represent the interaction energy of a charged spin-1/2 particle in a
magnetic ﬁeld ~B = (0, By, Bz). In this case,

where g is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle. This example is trivial in the sense that
H can be easily diagonalized to yield the exact eigenvalues

However, the comparison of these exact results with the approximate eigenvalues obtained
below by Pad´e interpolation will provide a way to gauge the accuracy of the approximation
method.

, for example, if the magnetic ﬁeld is almost aligned with the y-axis, the
bσz term in H may be treated as a perturbation. To be more explicit, we may express the

This Pad´e approximant is uniquely determined from the perturbative expansions for E+
given in Eqs. (10) and (11). Table I compares this Pad´e interpolation result with the
exact eigenvalue, Eq. (8), for various values of the parameter

interpolation yields an approximation that is within 1% of the exact result for all values

As a second example, consider a single particle subject to a one-dimensional linear plus
harmonic oscillator potential. (The Pad´e interpolation technique we shall use to solve this
problem is similar to that applied in Ref. 2 to nonrelativistic quarkonium systems.) The
Hamiltonian that describes the motion of the particle is

where γ > 0. (The latter condition is necessary in order for the Hamiltonian H1 in Eq. (15)
to admit stationary state solutions.) V (x) represents the rigid wall potential:

The presence of V (x) restricts the particle’s motion to be along the positive x-axis.

The Hamiltonian in Eq. (13) without V (x) appears in many textbooks on quantum
mechanics,5 and can be easily solved by transforming to a new coordinate x′ with the origin
γ/(mω2). The presence of the rigid wall potential, however, requires all wave
at x =
functions to vanish for x
0 and renders such a coordinate redeﬁnition useless. The
Hamiltonian with γ = 0 is also a typical textbook problem6 that is exactly soluble; the
boundary condition due to the rigid wall forces all energy eigenfunctions to vanish at the
origin, which implies that only the harmonic oscillator states with odd parity are allowed.
Solving the complete Hamiltonian (13) is a somewhat more challenging task. In particu-
lar, if the linear and quadratic potentials are comparable, conventional perturbative methods
are not applicable. We shall therefore resort to the method outlined in Sec. II to ﬁnd its
eigenvalues. Note that as long as we conﬁne the particle’s motion to the positive x branch,
and impose the boundary condition that all eigenfunctions vanish at x = 0, we may drop

the rigid wall potential V (x) in Eq. (13). The resulting Hamiltonian can then be cast in the
form of Eq. (1), with

where, for simplicity, we have set ¯h = 1, m = 1 and ω = 1 such that the arbitrary parameter
γ alone regulates the relative importance of the two potential energy terms. Note that it
is also necessary to split the kinetic energy term. Here, we have arbitrarily put half of the
original kinetic energy term into each of the sub-Hamiltonians in Eqs. (15) and (16). As we
will see (in the last paragraph of this section), better accuracy will generally be achieved in
Pad´e interpolation if a larger fraction of the kinetic energy is included in the sub-Hamiltonian
containing the dominant potential energy term.

The solutions to H1 are the familiar Airy functions Ai(z), with z = (2/γ)2/3(γx

the energy eigenvalues ǫ<
j are determined by the roots of Ai(z). On the other hand, H2 is

solved by exp(

to satisfy the boundary condition ψj(0) = 0, where ψj(x) denotes the stationary state wave

We now proceed to perform the relevant perturbative calculations. We have evaluated
to ﬁrst, second, and third order in λ and 1/λ the approximate ground and ﬁrst excited
state energies for γ = 1, that is, when the linear and quadratic potential energy terms
are comparable, and have formed the unique Pad´e approximant for each instance. Because
closed-form expressions for integrals involving Airy functions generally do not exist, we did
the exercise numerically. As an illustration, the analysis of the ground state generates the
two series,

follows from manipulating the ﬁrst two (three) terms of Eqs. (17) and (18). Tables II and
III contain a summary of the results for the ground and ﬁrst excited states.

It is instructive to compare these results with those one would obtain from conventional
perturbative calculations alone. Because there is no preference for either of the two potential
energy terms, we consider both of the following parameterizations of the Hamiltonian:

where α and β are the small parameters that are eventually set to 1. As seen in Tables II and
III, the Pad´e interpolation gives by far the most stable results. A further comparison with
exact solutions from the numerical integration of the Schr¨odinger equation, also given in
Tables II and III, exempliﬁes the validity of the method. We have also checked the accuracy
of the method for higher excited states. The approximate energies obtained, even to ﬁrst
order in the perturbation parameters, are always accurate to within 1% of their exact values.
For completeness, we have examined situations in which one potential energy term is
dominant, and perturbative calculations on the smaller term alone are expected to yield
reasonably accurate results. This is certainly the case. However, as seen in Tables IV and
V, the Pad´e interpolation is able to do a better job, provided that the original kinetic energy
term is distributed among the two sub-Hamiltonians (15) and (16) in a way that reﬂects the
relative signiﬁcance of the two potential energy terms. We have also studied the eﬀects of
distributing the kinetic energy unevenly between the two sub-Hamiltonians in the γ = 1 case.
As shown in Tables VI and VII, rather good estimates of the exact results can be achieved
regardless of how the kinetic energy is distributed, particularly if one goes to higher order.
However, the best accuracy is obtained if somewhat less kinetic energy (40% to be precise)
is included in H1, especially for the ﬁrst excited state. This result can be understood from
Tables II and III which show that the perturbation series for H ′(λ) converges faster than
H(λ) to the exact result. This behavior in turn suggests that for γ = 1, the linear potential
is weaker than the quadratic potential. Hence, according to the results in Tables IV and V,
a more accurate Pad´e approximant will be obtained by underweighting the kinetic energy
in H1. Unfortunately, there are no quantitative rules for how the kinetic energy should be
distributed among the two sub-Hamiltonians. Tables VI and VII suggest that a 50 : 50 split
should produce reasonably good estimates.

IV. CONCLUSION

The stationary state problems considered here provide a good illustration of the power
of Pad´e interpolation for problems for which exact solutions are diﬃcult to obtain and
ordinary perturbation methods are not applicable. For practice, the interested reader may
wish to apply the method to interpolate the strong-ﬁeld and weak-ﬁeld Zeeman eﬀects in
hydrogen. Exact results for the n = 2 level can be found in Ref. 6. They involve square-
root functions of the expansion parameter (the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld), similar
to the ﬁrst example discussed in Sec. III. See also Ref. 7 which discusses the case of the
two-dimensional hydrogen atom.

The use of Pad´e interpolation is of course not limited to quantum mechanical problems,
because all that is needed is an expansion parameter, be it a physical one as in Eq. (9) or an
artiﬁcial one such as the interpolation parameter in Eq. (1), for which the behavior of the
physical system can be calculated or measured when the parameter is small as well as when
it is large. We encourage the reader to ﬁnd other applications of this useful approximation
scheme.

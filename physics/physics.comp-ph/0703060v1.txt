Abstract
Efﬁcient design and performance of electrically actuated
MEMS devices necessitate accurate estimation of electrostatic
forces on the MEMS structures. This in turn requires thorough
study of the capacitance of the structures and ﬁnally the charge
density distribution on the various surfaces of a device. In this
work, nearly exact BEM solutions have been provided in order
to estimate these properties of a parallel narrow beam structure
found in MEMS devices. The effect of three-dimensionality,
which is an important aspect for these structures, and asso-
ciated fringe ﬁelds have been studied in detail. A reasonably
large parameter space has been covered in order to follow
the variation of capacitance with various geometric factors.
The present results have been compared with those obtained
using empirical parametrized expressions keeping in view the
requirement of the speed of computation. The limitations of
the empirical expressions have been pointed out and possible
approaches of their improvement have been discussed.

Keywords: MEMS, narrow beam, comb drive, Boundary

Element Method (BEM), fringe capacitance.

1. Introduction

The capacitance in MEMS structures has always been an
important aspect to be studied from the very beginning of this
ﬁeld of research. Under certain circumstances, the presence
of capacitance has turned out to be beneﬁcial while it has
been considered as a challenge in some other. In either case,
estimation of this capacitance has drawn prime importance
reasonably in the design and subsequent use of these devices.
The sensitivity, instability and dynamics of a MEMS device
depend crucially upon an interplay of electrical and mechani-
cal forces generated within the device. Since the electrostatic
force alters the dynamic properties of a MEMS structure and
the electrostatic charges redistribute as the structure deforms
and thereby change the electrostatic force distribution, a
complex electromechanical coupling dictates the performance
of the device. This may induce non-linearity in electrostatic
force ultimately leading to a pull-in stage. The presence of
fringe ﬁeld may further complicate the situation. Thus an
accurate device modeling calls for an efﬁcient electromechan-
ical analysis of the structure which in turn depends crucially
on the precision of electrostatic analysis. The electrostatic
analysis deals with precise estimation of observables like
charge density distribution,
total charge content etc. from
which the important quantities like capacitance, electrostatic

force can be estimated. While the capacitance of a conductor
represents its overall charge content and, thus, determines sev-
eral important properties like electrostatic load distribution on
a given structure or induced current, the charge distribution on
the conductor ﬁnally becomes the most important observable.
The approaches pursued for the electrostatic modeling are
predominantly analytical or numerical domain approaches
such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) or surface integral
approaches such as the Boundary Element Method (BEM) [1].
Among these, the ﬁrst one, although very fast and accurate, can
unfortunately be implemented in a very limited range of two
dimensional geometries. There have also been various attempts
at providing analytic expression for variation of capacitance
for example, in parallel plate structure as a function of the
variation of geometrical properties in [2] and the references
therein. The numerical approaches on the other hand are
capable of taking care of 3D geometry and thus can provide
more detailed and realistic estimates. The FEM approach
is particularly very ﬂexible in terms of 3D modeling, but
demands large computational expenditure for achieving the
required accuracy. As a result, the BEM approach has turned
out to be the more popular since it produces results of good
accuracy with relatively less computational cost. The method
has its own drawbacks such as loss of accuracy in the near-
ﬁeld, necessity of special treatment to handle numerical and
physical singularities. For example, different special formula-
tions for thick, moderately thin and very thin plate have been
devised to compute the necessary properties such as surface
charge density and capacitance of a parallel plate structure in
order to handle the drawbacks of BEM [3].

Several parametrized formulations have been devised with
the help of the numerical methods for fast computation of
capacitance in MEMS structures [4], [5], [6] in order to
evade the time consuming modeling, computation and other
numerical complexities associated with the FEM and BEM.
However, these formulations are found to be restricted to
speciﬁc parameter space as well as 2D geometry.

All the drawbacks associated with FEM and BEM have
been removed to a large extent in a novel approach of BEM
formulation devised by ourselves using the analytic solution
of Green’s function form of the potential due to a uniform
charge distribution on a boundary element [7], [8]. The solver
based on this nearly exact BEM (neBEM) formulations has
been found to excel in electrostatic analysis of MEMS yielding
very precise results throughout the domain of interest and at

a very close proximity to any surface which are well known
handicaps of conventional BEM. In [7], the effect of geometric
parameters like thickness of each plate and the gap between
them on the charge density distribution and the capacitance of
a parallel plate structure were studied. Here, a similar study
has been carried out for a narrow beam structure which has
already been identiﬁed to be strongly inﬂuenced by fringe
ﬁeld. For example, very strong fringe ﬁeld effect has been
observed in vertical comb-drive actuator in comparison to
parallel plate actuator [9] stressing the need for carrying out
such a study. Besides, it has been reported in [10] that even
for a plate conﬁguration, when the size of the electrod is
not much bigger than the gap, the fringe effect can not be
ignored any more. This, of course, was reﬂected in our earlier
studies as well. In addition to studying the effect of the various
geometric parameters such as the length, width, height and
gap between the two beams on the charge density distribution
and capacitance,
the accuracy of the various approximate
expressions available for fast estimation of capacitance of
comb-like structure relevant to MEMS devices has also been
checked out. The reasons of failure of such expressions have
been discussed and possible ways of improvement have been
suggested.

2. Validation of neBEM
The results of electrostatic force and capacitance for a par-
allel plate capacitor provided by neBEM have been compared
to that obtained with Coventor’s ARCHITECT software and
its Parametrized ElectroMechanical model (PEM) [11]. The
parallel plate conﬁguration consists of a square plate of side,
Lp = 100µm and thickness, tp = 2µm separated by a distance
H from a square electrode with side, Le = 100µm, thickness,
te = 0.45µm. The analytical solution of the electrostatic force
can be written as follows.

nice agreement with the analytical solution as seen from ﬁg.1.
It should be mentioned here that the numerical convergence
of the solution while using the BEM needs close inspection.
It has been experienced that the higher mesh reﬁnement in
BEM which produces convergent capacitance values may not
necessarily yield convergent force [12]. In case of neBEM,
the numerical convergence of the results has been tested with
mesh reﬁnement as well as monitoring the associated charge
distributions. It has been found that even with relatively coarse
a discretization scheme of 800 elements only, the convergent
force values could be achieved which hardly improved by
reﬁning the scheme. The results produced with different dis-
cretization schemes have been depicted in ﬁg.1. The charge
density distribution on the top plate for a gap of 2µm has
been shown in ﬁg.2 as a typical case.

The capacitance values calculated following the neBEM
has shown a difference with what predicted by the PEM

3. Geometry of Narrow beam structures

Narrow beam structures of wide geometric variations have
been used in MEMS devices. As an example, in ﬁg.4 presented
is a comb drive which is actually used as a position sensor
in MEMS systems. We have considered a much simpliﬁed
geometry (Fig.5) which, nevertheless, retains the basic char-
acteristics of such structures. Here, the length, breadth, height
of the beam are denoted by l, b and h respectively, and the
half-gap between the two beams by g. It can be seen from
various references in the published literature that l can range
from mm to tens of µm. The breadth, b and height, h can
be as small as 2µm and 4µm. The gap, g also has a wide
range of variation from tens of µm to just 1µm. There can be

expenses and also help in saving time to a very great extent.
But, even to build proper parametric dependence, we need to
solve the 3D problem to an acceptable accuracy.

4. Results and discussions

To study the variation of capacitance depending upon various
geometric parameters in a parallel narrow beam structure, a
convention similar to [4] has been adopted where, in order to
facilitate parametrization, the followings have been deﬁned

β = h
b

, η = h
g

λ = l
b

In addition to the above, another dimensionless parameter has
been included.

According to these parameters, the problem geometry varies
from 0.1 ≤ β ≤ 5, 0.5 ≤ η ≤ 10 and 1.5 ≤ λ ≤ 75. The
variation can be huge, but a relatively narrow range has been
considered to facilitate data interpretation and analysis.

4.1. Variation of capacitance

To study the variation of capacitance per unit length with
different geometric parameters, the results computed by the
neBEM solver has been compared with those calculated using
various empirical parametric formulations presented in [4]. In
Table 1, the percent deviation incurred by various methods
of estimation as well as the neBEM with respect to Method
of Moment (MoM) calculation has been tabulated. A column
of λ has been added in the table to examine the effect of
ﬁnite length of the beam which has not been considered in
the parametric calculations. It may be recounted that for the
present computations, l and h have been kept ﬁxed at 150µm
and 10µm. The parameter b has varied from 100µm to 2µm,

Fig. 4. Comb drives used as position sensor (Photo courtsey:Kionix Inc.)

devices where these wide variations are even more extended.
Instead of trying to cover the whole range of the parameters,
we consider narrow beams of l = 150µm, b varying from
100µm to 2µm, height h = 10µm and g varying from 20µm
to 1µm.

As is obvious from the above range of dimensions, effect
of three dimensionality in the narrow beam structures is likely
to be even more signiﬁcant than the parallel plate structures.
In many cases of practical interest, even approaches based on
reducing the 3D problem to a 2D one, and then recovering the
3D solution as developed in [13] is unlikely to produce good
results, especially when, according to some researchers an
accuracy of the order of 99% is what should be acceptable in
estimating the different parameters related to MEMS devices.
Moreover, approaches based on reducing dimensions as above
are likely to face problems when the cross-section of the
structure varies in the direction of sweep. Thus, these efﬁcient
approaches can not be counted on for solving problems of a
very general nature. As a result, from the very outset, we
prepared ourselves to handle the problem in complete 3D.
According to us, rather than evading the 3D nature of the
problem, more important is to develop a fast and precise solver.
The question of possible parametrization in various ranges,
if possible, can of course help in reducing computational

while g from 20µm to 1µm (Fig.5. The deviation of the
calculations w.r.t MoM values has been plotted as a function
of η (inverse gap) in ﬁg.6. The wide variation between the
neBEM and parametric results is, in fact, expected because
the parametric formulation has been devised for 2D geometry
whereas the neBEM takes care of 3D one. Whenever η is
small (large gap), for small values of λ (large b for a ﬁxed
l), the parametric assumption breaks down resulting in large
difference between the 2D and 3D results which reﬂects the
effect of fringing ﬁeld. However, for the same λ, the difference
reduces considerably when the gap between the two structures
is reduced (larger η). Obviously, the disagreement between the
2D and 3D results improves when λ becomes larger (smaller b)
for a ﬁxed η reﬂecting the reduction in fringe ﬁeld effect. The
MoM result, and thus those due to [4] are likely to be correct
only if the length is much larger than all other dimensions
of the beam. This, unfortunately, cannot be very realistic a
picture for every narrow beam structure used in MEMS. It is
conceivable from the results that all the lengths of the device
play important role, and for a true measure of capacitance
and related properties, none of these can really be neglected
unless we stick to a reasonably narrow parameter window.
The window considered above, according to us, is not narrow
enough.

4.2. Variation of charge density distribution

There is a large increase in charge density near the edges and
corners on each surface. Since the electrostatic force depends
on this charge density distribution directly, the ﬁnite nature
of the length can cause error while predicting these important
properties of an MEMS device. It may be safer to critically
examine the parameter window of interest and only then decide
regarding the 2D or 3D nature of the problem. The surface
charge density on the surfaces facing the gap and away from
it have been illustrated in ﬁg.7 and ﬁg.?? which shows that the

densities on the various surfaces of the narrow beams, in ﬁgs.9
and 10, the charge densities along the mid-sections of each
surface of a beam for the largest gap, g = 20µm and the
smallest gap, g = 1µm have been presented. The breadth of
the beam has been considered to be b = 20µm which is a
representative one. Naturally, the charge density is expected
to vary as b changes from 100µm to 2µm. Please note that in
these ﬁgures, the charge densities on the upper beam of the
overall structure have been plotted. According to this ﬁgure,
the top surface is the one that is away from the gap, while
the bottom one faces the gap and the other beam structure.
The left and right surfaces are at constant values of X, while
the front and back surfaces are at constant values of Z. The
variations of charge density for the top and bottom surfaces
are along X, left and right surfaces are along Y while for
the front and back surfaces are along the X axis. All the
distances have been normalized with respect to the length
in the corresponding direction for the convenience of both
presentation and interpretation.

When the gap is large, the charge density distribution is
found to be quite even for many of the surfaces except the
surface far away from the gap owing to large fringe ﬁeld effect.

It may be noted here that the symmetric nature of the problem
is accurately reﬂected in the presented results. Thus, the values
obtained for left-right and front-back surfaces are completely
indistinguishable from each other. The left and right surfaces
have an asymmetric distribution of charge density with respect
to Y, which also is expected. Lesser values of Y in these cases
implies proximity to the gap and thus have larger values of
charge density. Moreover, the existence of the edges are clearly
visible in all the data points. It should be noticed here that all
the surfaces having accumulated quite even charges contribute
signiﬁcantly in the total charge content, thus indicating the
consideration of 3D nature of the problem.

The case where the gap between the beams is very small
in comparison to all the other dimensions, the average charge
density of the surface facing the gap is much larger than the
surface charge density of the all the surfaces of the beam
implying less fringe ﬁeld effect. In addition, since the area
of this surface is large in comparison to most of the other
surfaces, its contribution towards the total charge content of
the beam completely dominates over the contribution of the
other surfaces. This indicates that at this situation, various elec-
trostatic properties can be approximated by two-dimensional
conﬁgurations to a large extent.

From the previous discussions, it has seemed to us that
the very approach of supplying an expression that will work
throughout a large parameter space is bound to face difﬁcul-
ties. It may be far more prudent to divide the parameter space
in smaller sub-regions and try to ﬁnd appropriate relations
valid in that sub-space of parameters. In terms of computation,
this is not likely to be burdensome as our experience with the
neBEM solver suggests. Moreover, the expressions are likely
to be far more precise in predicting the capacitance of MEMS
structures. However, the very task of ﬁnding these expressions
may be lengthy and laborious. We plan to carry out a thorough
study in this direction in the near future.

5. Conclusions

A 3D computation of capacitance of a MEMS parallel narrow
beam structure has been presented in this work. The results
have been compared with several existing estimates which are
essentially 2D in nature. Signiﬁcant variation in the results
have been observed and the reasons behind these discrepancies
have been discussed by analyzing the charge densities on the
various surfaces of a beam with the variation of the gap in the
device. The effect of ﬁnite length, even for narrow beams, has
been found to be quite large in many areas of the parameter
space covered. It has been ﬁnally concluded that it may be
difﬁcult to ﬁnd a single expression that will represent the
variation of capacitance with geometrical parameters covering
a large parameter space.

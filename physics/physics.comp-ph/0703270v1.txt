Nulear spin interferene e(cid:27)ets generated in a

marosopi sample of 10 ml degassed water are de-
teted in a simple NMR experiment. A π/2 − τ −
π/2 RF double pulse sequene (Ramsey sequene) is

applied to the water sample immersed in a stati mag-

neti (cid:28)eld B0 ≈ 4.7 T. For a homogeneity of B0 of
the order of ∆B0/B0 = 2 · 10−8

, the nulear spin

interferene term is ontrolled with a maximum rela-

tive deviation of 9.7 %. These results are a (cid:28)rst step

The Hamiltonian of this system is (~ = 1):

H = −µ · B0 = γ · I · B0,

(1)

where γ is the gyromagneti ratio of the spin I . By
onvention, B0 gives the z diretion of the oordi-
nates and the x0y plane is alled the transverse plane.
The magneti (cid:28)eld diretion z is the most natural

quantum axis along whih one an de(cid:28)ne two eigen-

where ω0 = γ · B0 is the angular frequeny of the
allowed transition between |−i and |+i. As there is
a statistial ensemble of N nulear spins, one has to

onsider the density matrix of the system. At thermal

equilibrium, the population of eah eigenstate is given

by the Boltzmann distribution and then the density

matrix an be written as:

ρ0 =

((1 − d) |+ih+| + (1 + d) |−ih−|) ,

1
2

where one made the approximation e±ω0/2kT ≈ 1 ± d,
with d = ω0/2kT . The NMR signal originates
from transverse magneti moments Mx and My . For
matter of larity, one an only onsider Mx whih
is given by the trae of the ρ · Sx matrix (noted
Mx = Tr [ρ · Sx]) where Sx = 1
2 (|+ih−| + |−ih+|) [8℄.
One an notie that Tr [ρ0 · Sx] = 0, meaning that

there is no NMR signal at thermal equilibrium as

expeted [9, 10℄. The system an be modi(cid:28)ed by a

perturbation obtained by a polarized RF wave gener-

ated by an osillating urrent in a resonator at the fre-

queny ω0/2π . An RF pulse ats on a nulear spin as
a rotation of Euler angles (θ, β) in the spin spae [8℄.

In the (|−i, |+i) basis, the rotation matrix for spin

is:

r[θ, β] = cos

In term of the density matrix, a (θ, β) rotation
of ρ0 gives a rotated ρ1 density matrix aording
to: ρ1 = r−1[θ, β] · ρ0 · r[θ, β], where r−1[θ, β] ·
r[θ, β] = 1 (unity matrix). We (cid:28)rst take β = 0.
After a single pulse θ, Mx[θ] is given by: Mx[θ] =
= d/2 sin θ. As it is well

known, one (cid:28)nds that after a single RF pulse the sig-

nal is maximum for θ = π/2 (the RF pulse is alled a
π/2 pulse) and zero for θ = π (π pulse). The issue of

the experiment desribed in this artile is to produe

a sequene of two onseutive π/2 pulses separated
by a time τ during whih the eigenstates follow their

own free evolution.

It is the equivalent for nulear

spins in water moleules to the famous N. Ramsey

(2)

experiment for a beam of potassium atoms [6℄. The

sample is (cid:28)rst shined by a π/2 pulse, whih means
that the initial density matrix ρ0 turns to be:

ρ1 = r†[π/2, 0]ρ0r[π/2, 0]

=

|+ih+| +

|−ih+| +

During a time τ , the density matrix ρ1 is free to
evolve in B0 . This free evolution obeys to the equa-
dt = H ρ1 − ρ1H , where H is given by equa-
tion i dρ1
tion (1). One an easily show that after time τ , the

density matrix of the system turns to be:

If one then applies a seond r[π/2, β] rotation to ρ2 ,
the (cid:28)nal density matrix ρ3 after this π/2−τ −π/2 se-
quene is ρ3 = r†[π/2, β]ρ0r[π/2, β], where β is the
relative phase of the two π/2 pulse (cid:28)elds. One an
then alulate Mx after this sequene, whih gives :

Mx = Tr [ρ3 · Sx] =

sin ω0τ sin β.

(3)

One an easily see that in absene of free evolution,

i.e.

τ = 0, Tr [ρ3 · Sx] = 0, and there is no sig-
nal. This is due to the fat that in the τ = 0 ase,
the π/2 − τ − π/2 sequene orresponds to a single
π pulse on the sample whih indeed gives no sig-

nal.

In fat, aording to equation (3), providing

2

that β 6= 0, Mx 6= 0 only if the nulear spin state
interferene term sin ω0τ is di(cid:27)erent from zero. In a
π/2−τ −π/2 sequene, the existene of any NMR sig-

nal is then the evidene of the ourrene of nulear

spin interferenes.

3 Material and methods

A sample of 10 ml of degassed water was plaed at

room temperature in a wide-bore magnet with a mag-

neti (cid:28)eld of 4.7 T (Magnex). The NMR spetrome-

ter (SMIS) allows a phase preision of the RF pulses

. The RF pulses had a gaussian shaped

of 0.25 ◦
intensity with a duration d = 600 µs, a frequeny
ω0/2π = 200, 137 MHz, and half-width of 3000 Hz.

The inter pulse delay between the ends of the (cid:28)rst and

seond pulse was τ = 1 ms. The NMR signal was de-

teted in quadrature mode with a sample frequeny

of 5000 Hz and 8 K points. The intensity of the sig-
nal is obtained as the modulus of the 2 parts given

by the quadrature detetion mode. The homogeneity

of the magneti (cid:28)eld was measured by the line width

obtained by Fourier Transform of the free indution

deay (FID) aquired after a π/2 pulse. T1 measured
by inversion-reovery sequene was 3.2 s and T2 mea-

sured by a Carr-Purell-Meiboom-Gill sequene [11℄

was 1.8 s slightly depending on the homogeneity of

the magneti (cid:28)eld. NMR spetrum of pure water,

as for all liquid sample with no J oupling, displays

a very narrow line due to the motion averaging of

tem is highly isolated from its surrounding and it is

well-known that the relaxation time T1 whih har-

aterizes the energy exhange with the lattie and

the inverse of the line width whih measures the de-

oherene time are very long in high homogeneous

magneti (cid:28)eld.

Experimentally, it was impossible for us to tune τ
at a time sale small enough to vary ω0τ over 2π .

homogeneous magneti (cid:28)eld (∆B0/B0 = 2.0 · 10−8)
and dashed line in less homogeneous (cid:28)eld (∆B0/B0 =
2.7 · 10−7).

ω0τ , i.e. the rms magnitude of the (cid:29)utuating part of
this angle ω0τ remains muh smaller than 2π . Under

this last ondition, one an then plot the NMR signal

given by the π/2−τ−π/2(β) sequene as a funtion of
β , the relative phase of the two π/2 pulse (cid:28)elds and

ompare the results to that given by equation (3). If

the experimental data math equation (3), then the

nulear spin interferene term is revealed and also

ontrolled.

The NMR signal (FID) after a single π/2 pulse is

mainly dependent on the homogeneity of the mag-

neti (cid:28)eld B0 . On Fig 1 one an see the FID reorded
after a single π/2 pulse in a highly homogeneous (cid:28)eld
(∆B0/B0 = 2.0 · 10−8
a less homogeneous one (∆B0/B0 = 2.7 ·10−7
line). With a π/2−τ −π/2 sequene, it is well known
that NMR gives rise to an eho at time t = τ after
the seond π/2 pulse, desribed in 1950 by E. Hahn

, ontinuous line) ompared to

dashed

as spin eho [12℄. But, here we have measured the

and with small inter pulse delays where no spin eho

is deteted as seen on Fig. 2 (ontinuous line). Even

in the less homogeneous magneti (cid:28)eld there is a mod-

ulation of the FID but no eho at 1 ms whih is the
delay between the two π/2 pulses. The absene of

eho in this ase is equivalent to the absene of any

eho for an homogeneous line in an Eletron Spin Res-

onane (ESR) experiment. The FID orresponds to

the magnetization in the transverse plane and there-

fore the signal is proportional to qM 2

x + M 2

y . Fig. 3

shows the amplitude of the NMR signal at the begin-

ning of the FID versus the relative phase β . As seen

However, it is possible to ensure over typial exper-

in Fig. 3, in the ase of a highly homogeneous mag-

(given by equation (3) for a well de(cid:28)ned value of ω0τ )

(cid:28)ts the experimental data pretty well. The maximum

relative deviation ∆s (β) = (NMR1(β)−f (β))
max(NMR1(β)) between
the experimental urve NMR1 (β) and f (β) is found
to be ∆s(15◦) = 9.7%. In the ase of a less homoge-
neous (cid:28)eld (∆B0/B0 = 2.7 · 10−7), the (cid:28)t is less good

and the maximum relative deviation is found to be

∆s(18◦) = 28.3%.

5 Conlusion

We have shown here, that if the homogeneity of the

stati and RF magneti (cid:28)elds are ontrolled at an

enough high auray, we an ontrol the nulear spin

interferene term out the marosopi sample of wa-

ter moleules up to a maximum relative deviation

of 9.7%. This number may ertainly be dereased

by giving additional are to the experimental set up.

However, these results are a (cid:28)rst step to manipula-

any appropriate liquid moleules with negligible in-

terations with their environment.

The main appliation of this marosopi quantum

behavior is to use magneti gradients to de(cid:28)ne several

qubits by their frequenies in a spei(cid:28) magneti en-

vironment rather than qubits de(cid:28)ned by the hemial

environment in a moleule. Suh an approah ould

lead into a more salable [13℄ NMR omputer than

the use of hemial moleules. If the reported exper-

iments involve only one qubit, by using a magneti

gradient along the diretion of the tube ontenting

the water sample, it ould be de(cid:28)ned a linear arrange-

ment of several qubits. The same setup ould be used

to reate and manipulate up to thirty qubits arranged

along a line, thus realizing one-dimensional (and thus

rather sophistiated but not universal [14℄) quantum

ellular automata on 30 qubits. We see no di(cid:30)-

ulties in extending our approah to two- and, pos-

sibly, three-dimensional settings implementing uni-

versal quantum ellular automata omputers on at

least as many qubits. Theses results on manipula-

tion of nulear spin oherene of water represent the

(cid:28)rst step in a radially new, salable and easily re-

produible approah to the (cid:28)eld of quantum infor-

mation proessing based on liquid state NMR teh-

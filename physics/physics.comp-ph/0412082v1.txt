Abstract

In this paper we develop the Lagrangian and multisymplectic structures of the Heisenberg magnet (HM) model
which are then used as the basis for geometric discretizations of HM. Despite a topological obstruction to the
existence of a global Lagrangian density, a local variational formulation allows one to derive local conservation
laws using a version of N¨other’s theorem from the formal variational calculus of Gelfand-Dikii. Using the
local Lagrangian form we extend the method of Marsden, Patrick and Schkoller to derive local multisymplectic
discretizations directly from the variational principle. We employ a version of the ﬁnite element method to
S2 over an appropriate space-time
discretize the space of sections of the trivial magnetic spin bundle N = M
M . Since sections do not form a vector space, the usual FEM bases can be used only locally with coordinate
transformations intervening on element boundaries, and conservation properties are guaranteed only within an
element. We discuss possible ways of circumventing this problem, including the use of a local version of the
method of characteristics, non-polynomial FEM bases and Lie-group discretization methods.

Introduction

The treatment of PDEs in invariant form ﬁnds its most natural language in the setting of jet bundles over an
appropriate space-time. In this setting, governing equations of “motion” are prescribed by invariantly-deﬁned
diﬀerential operators, and although calculations are ultimately done in terms of partial derivatives, the invariant
meaning of all the operations is clear. Moreover, the invariant formulation and structure of the underlying ﬁber
bundle frequently translate to a nontrivial geometry of the space of solutions, conservation properties and other
“geometric” features. Although these geometric properties can be discovered in the coordinate formulation,
conceptual clarity of invariant geometric derivations is frequently a great asset in itself.

All of this is particularly so for Langrangian PDEs whose equations of motion are derived as extermality
conditions on the action functional – an apparently coordinate-free form. Symplectic and multisymplectic struc-
tures immediately follow by well-known procedures, as do conserved quantities corresponding to continuous
symmetries (N¨other’s theorem). The situation is less fortunate for Hamiltonian systems as here a number of
“symmetries” have been broken relative to the Lagrangian setting. A splitting of space-time relies upon the
choosing a preferred time direction and a nonunique complementary space – a literal symmetry breaking as the
full group of space-time transformations no longer preserves the form of the equations. Furthermore, the system
is no longer specifed by prescribing a single quantity – apart from the energy functional a Poisson structure has
to be speciﬁed independently1.

Although it may appear from familiar examples of classical mechanics that the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
pictures are equivalent, this is not always so. In fact there is a local nondegeneracy condition on the Poisson
bracket that must be satisﬁed before a local Lagrangian density can be reconstructed. In general, an additional

1In fact, there is a certain nonuniqueness associated with the choice of the canonical 1-form in Lagrangian theories living on jet
bundles N (r) with r > 1 [4, 7], although this is not as bad as the number of choices that need to be made in the Hamiltonian setting.

vanishing condition on a topological obstacle (i.e. exactness of the symplectic form) has to be satisﬁed before
the variational picture is restored globally. Even so, a local Lagrangian formulation carries enough information
to reconstruct the local multisymplectic geometry and N¨other-type local conservation laws. A central result
is the derivation of the local multisymplectic form for the Heisenberg Magnet model from its local Lagrangian
formulation.

Even when Lagrangian and Hamiltonian theories are equivalent, their discretizations may not be so. While
the discrete variational principle yields analogs of symplectic and multisymplectic geometries under minimal
conditions on the discretization, the Hamiltonian case calls for a sophisticated theory of symplectic or Poisson
integrators to preserve the corresponding geometries. Therefore, the search for an equivalent Lagrangian formu-
lation naturally arises when considering conservative discretizations. In this paper we discuss potential ways of
constructing geometric discretizations from the local variational picture.

In Section 2 we brieﬂy recall the picture of geometric PDEs as conditions on sections of an appropriate ﬁber
bundle and their jets. The formal calculus of variations of Gelfand-Dikii is a very convenient computational
tool for Lagrangian systems in this setting, and a source of many explicit formulas, including local conserved
densities and a formal analog of N¨other’s theorem. Section 3 contains the derivation of the local Lagrangian form
of HM, its conservation laws, and topological obstructions to the existence of a global description. The relation
to Novikov’s multivalued version of Morse theory as well as Lyusternik-Schnirelmann theory are discussed in this
section. In Section 4 we discuss variational discretizations of HM using a version of the ﬁnite-element method.
An essential diﬃculty here is that the sections are constrained to lie on the unit 2-sphere, which is not satisﬁed
by the standard FEM bases, and the resulting appearence of rational terms in the discrete Lagrangian. We
discuss ways of avoiding this problem, including the use of discretizations based on Lie group methods to satisfy
the sphere constraint in the most natural manner.

Geometrically, Y is the projection of Z onto the vertical subspace at Tσ(x)(N/M ) parallel to the horizontal
subspace TxΣ = Txσ

Jet bundles allow one to abstract from particular sections by encoding their inﬁnitesimal information point-
wise, similar to the way tangent bundles allow one to manipulate vectors without referring to local integral
Ar = C∞(N (r)) by the horizontal holonomic lift
curves. In general,
∂i = Hor( ∂

and derivations ∂i lie within the subspace V (N , M ) of formally ﬁber preserving ﬁelds, thus generating the
submodule Hor(N ) over K. Likewise the vertical holonomic lifts Ver(Y ) of ﬁelds on Y

3 Local Lagrangian of HM System

In this section we derive a local Lagrangian form of the action functional of the Heisenberg magnet (HM) model
since the symplectic form corresponding to the Poisson bracket of HM is not exact and a global Lagrangian does
not exist. Throughout this section we explicitly work in coordinates.

The HM model is a Hamiltonian system deﬁned on the product ﬁber bundle N = M

IR3, where the space-
time base is simply M = IR2 with coordinates (x1, x2) on the base and ~S = (S1, S2, S3) on the ﬁber (e.g. [5]).

formalism via the introduction of a Poisson bracket as a local bilinear operator Ψ(~S(x))δ(x

algebra of state variations (see [5]), and instead immediately write the equations of motion in the local form for

To restore independence of the ﬁber coordinates in (14) we can state that the vector product in (14) is
deﬁned with respect to the standard metric on IR3. There is a more natural way, however: the bracket (13) is
∗ ∼= IR3 dual to the Lie algebra so(3) [6], and therefore variational
the Lie-Poisson bracket on the space so(3)

The bracket (13) is nondegenerate on the leaves of a 2

the Kirillov form, is deﬁned. Since, as is easily veriﬁed, the dynamics of (14) preserves the leaves (

system can be considered on the bundle N (t) = M n−1
S2 with the unit sphere as the ﬁber, provided the initial
×
conditions are chosen as a section of this new bundle. It is well-known that the symplectic form dual to Ψ is the
area form on the sphere, which can be written down as soon as local coordinates have been chosen on S2. For
instance, the unit sphere with a deleted north pole can be parametrized by the inverse stereographic projection
from the pole (0, 0, 1). Following [5] we introduce the following transformation to complex coordinates:

To relate our formalism to [1] we introduce two matrices K and M and a coordinate vector z = (w, w, p, p)

(since wt, wt never show up explicitly, we can get away with fewer ﬁber coordinates):

It is important that the deﬁnition of these quantities ultimately relies on the choice of the primitive form θ,
which is deﬁned only locally. In general, we have no global deﬁnition for the conserved densities Tjk nor for the
Lagrangian density itself. The functionals deﬁned by these densities are known as multivalued functionals since
changes in local choices of θ result in diﬀerences by a multiple of a topological term, much like the multivalued
function ln z. This phenomenon was investigated, among others, in [9, 13], where [9] sets a general task of
relating the properties of critical points of such functionals to the topology of the underlying inﬁnite-dimensional
manifold of sections, extending the classical Morse theory, and, similarly, in the ﬁnite-dimensional case F ,
replacing functions of the Morse theory by nontrivial elements H 1(F, IR), i.e. close but non-exact forms. In our
situation the ﬁnite-dimensional case (θ) fully determines the inﬁnite-dimensional counterpart. The essential idea
of [9] is to ﬁnd a covering manifold on which the 1-form becomes exact, deﬁning a global function, to which the
classical Morse theory applies. At the moment it is not clear to us what covering of the sphere S2 will trivialize
θ. Such a covering is unlikely to be obtained by reduction of the symmetry groups SO(3) and SU (2) since, being
3-dimensional they do not carry a natural symplectic structure themselves, and being compact they do not have
factor-spaces ˆF with a nontrivial H 2( ˆF , IR). The necessary covering must be similar to an inﬁnitely-sheeted
surface of ln z, except covering the sphere completely (no branch points excluded). Further, the classical theory
due to Lyusternic-Shnirelmann extends the Morse theory in the inﬁnite-dimensional case to allow degenerate
functionals, and relates the numbers of its critical points of diﬀerent index to a topological invariant called the
Lyusternik-Shnirelmann category (see the recent work by Walter Craig on water waves). This theory does require
a globally-deﬁned Lagrangian function, which the Novikov-Morse theory promises to provide. Given this, we
should be able to estimate the number of solutions of a given kind (say, periodic ones) of HM on a given domain
(e.g., with periodic boundary conditions) including the higher-dimensional spatial cases. Similar considerations
apply to linearizations of HM near ﬁxed points or periodic solutions, promising to be a tool of stability analysis.
These investigations will be continued elsewhere.

4 HM discretizations

Given a PDE in variational form there are approaches to its discretizations that more or less automatically
produce discrete analogs of the preservation of the multisymplectic form (8), and frequently result in superior
discrete conservation laws (Cf. (9) which suggests a discrete analog of N¨other’s theorem). While [8] developed
a ﬁnite-diﬀerence approach to variational PDEs, we believe a more natural approach is to rely on the ﬁnite
element method (FEM) involving space-time meshes. One of the reasons is that the equation already possesses
a natural variational form, unlike many equations treated by a version of Galerkin’s method. Here we outline
our FEM-based approach to discretization of the HM model.

The element Lagrangian ˆLe corresponds to L∆ in [8] and represents one element’s contribution to the action.
For a regular mesh the discrete Lagrangian is invariant under a mesh shift and as can be easily seen from

(34), then the element Lagrangian is deﬁned in terms of the canonical element Lagrangian ˆL:

Le(w, w) = ˆL(w1

The discrete Euler-Lagrange ﬁeld equations (DELF, [8]) are obtained by diﬀerentiating the discrete action,
which depends on a particular nodal value wv only through the element Lagrangians corresponding to four

4.2 Alternative approaches

Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that the FEM-based methods developed above can be unstable,
apparently due to a relatively poor approximation of the rational terms in the polynomial bases. Here we sketch
alternative approaches that may help avoid these diﬃculties.

First, consider a local quasi-linear form of the HM equations of motion. For this construction we rewrite the

Lagrangian for HM and the equations of motion in the real coordinates w = a + ib:

This equation has the quasi-linear and even the semi-linear form and is amenable to the method of characteristics.
Another approach, relying on the construction of a special class of section bases spaces relies on Lie-group
methods. Limitations of space allow us only to sketch the approach. The group SO(3) acts transitively on S2,
therefore on each element e with canonical local coordinates e have ~S(x, t) = g(x, t)
SO(3) and the
action should be coadjoint (unlike the standard linear representation, found in the numerical literature), since it
interacts naturally with the commutator. The group near the identity must be parameterized by its Lie algebra
∼= IR3, so that g(x, t) =
exp(xA(x, t) + tB(x, t)) where A and B are polynomial functions of x, t with values
1
2 A)−1).
in so(3) and
Using a convenient choice of A and B we should be able to reduce the spin length constraint (orbit throught
~S0 diﬀeomorphic to a the coset space by a close subgroup of rotations around ~S0), but is linearization (ideal in
so(3)). The spaces of sections (no longer linear) generated by A and B in a certain smoothness class replace the
traditional FEM bases. The details are the subject of a forthcoming publication.

In this paper we have established the local Lagrangian and multisymplectic structure of the Heisenberg
magnet model, and have shown how the powerful formalism of the variational calculus can naturally lead to the
conservation properties and suggest natural discretizations.

Abstract We demonstrate an automatic method of force ﬁeld development for
molecular simulations. Parameter tuning is taken as an optimization problem
in many dimensions. The parameters are automatically adapted to reproduce
known experimental data such as the density and the heat of vaporization. Our
method is more systematic than guessing parameters and, at the same time
saves human labour in parameterization. It was successfully applied to several
molecular liquids: As a test, force ﬁelds for 2-methylpentane, tetrahydrofurane,
cyclohexene and cyclohexane were developed.

Keywords: force ﬁelds, molecular dynamics, parameter optimization, molecu-
lar liquids, simulation techniques

1 Introduction

In atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, one of the central problems is
the choice of the proper parameters for modeling the desired system. There is a
variety of approaches to this problem. Ab initio quantum chemistry would be an
ideal tool for this purpose if it were able to handle interactions of big molecules
in reasonable time. The standard solution, however, is quite pragmatic. One
either chooses a force ﬁeld that reproduces certain experimental data or one
takes standard values for the diﬀerent atoms. Hence, force ﬁeld design is either
a cumbersome trial-and-error procedure or relies heavily on the transferability
of parameters.

There are attempts to make the computer do this job, e.g. force ﬁeld devel-
opment by weak coupling [1, 2]. However, that procedure relies on the require-
ments that one force ﬁeld parameter dominates the behavior of one property
and that their relationship is monotonic. As, in more complex force ﬁelds, one
property may be inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly by several parameters, a more general
multidimensional optimization algorithm is needed. In our approach, we con-
sider the experimentally measured properties as multi-dimensional functions of

1

the parameters. Then we use the well-known simplex algorithm [3] to ﬁnd the
optimum parameter set.

2 Algorithm and Implementation

2.1 Simplex algorithm

The simplex method is a well-known algorithm for minimization in many di-
mensions [3]. It is not constrained by conditions like monotonicity, convexity or
diﬀerentiability of the function being optimized. It minimizes any single-valued
function of an arbitrary number of variables. Additionally, it is very robust in
ﬁnding a local optimum. Its main drawback is the large number of necessary
function evaluations, i.e in our case MD simulation runs, which are quite time
consuming. In the following we brieﬂy summarize the simplex algorithm used
in this work.

A simplex (a “ d-dimensional distorted tetrahedron”) is a set of d+1 points in
the d-dimensional parameter space. It is transformed geometrically depending
upon the “quality” of the function values. There are three geometric transfor-
mations in the algorithm.

1. In a reﬂection, the point xi with the highest function value is reﬂected

through the hyper-plane deﬁned by the other points (see ﬁgure 1a).

2. An expansion by the factor λ is a linear transformation of one point along

the normal of the hyper-plane deﬁned by the others (ﬁg. 1b).

Thus, a reﬂection is just the special case λ = −1.

3. A (d-dimensional) contraction is a linear transformation of all but one
point xj towards the lowest point (ﬁg. 1c). Contractions by a factor of 2
are applied.

x′
i =

1
2

(xi + xj), ∀i 6= j

The algorithm runs iteratively. Each iteration starts with a reﬂection of the
highest point. Depending on the function value at the new point, an expansion
or a contraction is performed. If the new point is better than the best point an
additional expansion with the factor λ = 2 (i.e. the distance to the hyper-plane
of the others is doubled) is applied to explore further into this “promising”

direction. If the new point point is very far away from the minimum (i.e. worse
than the second worst point up to now) an expansion with λ = 0.5 is applied.
If this resulting point is still very bad (in the above sense) a contraction around
the best point is performed. Then the next iteration, starting again with a
reﬂection, follows.

2.2 The target function evaluation

As the algorithm only knows about scalar functions in Rd, we have to con-
struct a single-valued function ftarget(p1, . . . , pd) of our force ﬁeld parameters
p1, . . . , pd. The function to be minimized should indicate the deviation of physi-
cal properties of the simulated model system from the real system as observed in
experiments. Typically, one chooses a set of physical properties {Pi}, which are
well characterized experimentally and converge rapidly in simulations. A natu-
ral choice for ftarget is the square root of the weighted sum of relative squared
deviations

(cid:18)
where Pi,target is the experimental value of property Pi. The square root is
chosen because it comes steeper to the minimum. The weights wi account for
the fact that some property may be easier to reproduce than others. Thus, the
algorithm can be forced to focus stronger on the diﬃcult properties. Typically,
the density ρ is easier reproduced than the enthalpy of vaporization ∆Hvap,
which are the two properties we optimize our force ﬁelds against. They converge
rapidly and experimental data is readily available for many ﬂuids (see e.g. [4, 5]).
If the number of parameters to be optimized is about 2 to 4 the ﬂexibility
to ﬁt the data is normally suﬃcient and the computational time is still man-
ageable. If there are more target properties it may be necessary to increase the
dimensionality of the optimization space at the cost of more computer time.

In the beginning, a simplex of parameter sets has to be constructed by the
user. These data may be guessed from parameters for similar compounds or

3

from standard force ﬁelds [6, 7, 8]. Furthermore, a starting conﬁguration of the
system is needed which should be close to the supposed real state. That means
that geometry and density should be almost correct. The starting conﬁgura-
tion is relaxed some picoseconds with a guessed force ﬁeld in order to obtain
a proper liquid structure. The target function for the initial parameter sets is
ﬁrst evaluated before the simplex algorithm starts.

2.3 Parameters to optimize

Since the dimensionality of parameter space is limited, we have to decide which
parameters of the force ﬁeld we want to optimize. This number is mainly limited
by the available computing resources.

Typically, a Lennard-Jones potential is used to model the non-bonded inter-

actions.

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:17)
The density ρ depends quite strongly on the Lennard-Jones radius σ whereas
the enthalpy of vaporization ∆Hvap depends stronger on ǫ. It is recommended
to optimize non-bonded interaction parameters or charges and not the molecu-
lar geometry, because of simulational stability. The fact, that the geometry is
mostly quite well known, supports this choice. There are several experimental
methods to determine geometries, e.g. x-ray or neutron diﬀraction in the crys-
tal or electron or microwave diﬀraction in the gas phase. Ab initio quantum
chemistry, too, gives molecular structures with useful accuracy. These geome-
tries can, in most cases, be used for the liquid phase as well. Hence, we did
not try the algorithm on geometry optimization although this may be possible
in principle. Our simulations focused on the liquid phase, whose macroscopic
properties depend only weakly on internal force ﬁeld parameters. Therefore,
the force ﬁeld parameters for angles and dihedral angles may be adopted from
similar force ﬁelds.

2.4 Equilibration

A MD run can produce reliable results only if the system has been equilibrated.
Therefore, we need a scheme to test for equilibration which has to fulﬁll several
requirements: It has to reject reliably non-equilibrated conﬁgurations because
otherwise all following results are meaningless. It has to work fully automatic
inside the overall algorithm, and it has to equilibrate as fast as possible in order
not to waste resources.

If the force ﬁeld parameters (i.e. the Hamiltonian) of a simulation change
between iterations, like in our case, a conﬁguration equilibrated with respect to
the old parameters is no longer equilibrated with respect to the new ones. Hence,
after each change of parameters, i.e. in each step of the simplex algorithm we
have to re-equilibrate with respect to the actual parameters. In order to do this,
we take as the starting conﬁguration the ﬁnal conﬁguration from a simulation

4

with a parameter set, which is close to the new one. As “distance” in parameter
space we deﬁne the sum of squared deviations

|{p(new)} − {p(old)}|2 :=

(p(new)
i

− p(old)
i

)2.

(6)

n

i=1
X

If, for some reason, the equilibration did not converge for that set or some other
problem occurred a standard conﬁguration is used.

Using the conﬁguration selected in this way we start a number of successive
equilibration runs (typical length 50ps with 1fs timestep). These runs are ana-
lyzed for equilibration until they are either accepted or a maximum number of
runs (in our case 10) is exceeded. In the latter case, the parameters are consid-
ered not useful and the target function ftarget is set to an arbitrary high value
in order to indicate the failure.

How does the automatic determination of equilibration work? To our knowl-
edge, there is no strict criterion for equilibration. The standard procedure is
to inspect visually the time development of a typical quantity (like the density
for low molecular weight liquids). Then one decides if it “settled” to stochastic
oscillations around a converged mean value. In our case, we use the following
test: The time series of the density is cut into 3 to 5 intervals, for each of which
the mean and the standard error are calculated.
If all these averages agree
within their errors the conﬁguration is considered equilibrated. In comparison
with the “human eye”-method, this method proved to be rather strict. How-
ever, this is necessary because we cannot accept non-equilibrated conﬁgurations
which would mislead the simplex algorithm. The equilibration scheme worked
well and led on average to an equilibrated conﬁguration in about 3 to 4 runs.
Naturally, the number of runs decreases during the optimization because the
changes in the parameters get less drastic. We also checked a second equilibra-
tion test where the last third of the simulation was ﬁtted by linear regression.
If the slope is zero within its error the conﬁguration is assumed equilibrated.
The outcomes of the two tests diﬀered only slightly.

Only very few parameter sets (less than 10%) had to be discarded due to

non-equilibration. Even fewer led to instabilities in the simulation.

2.5 Convergence criterion

The simplex algorithm ﬁnishes if the target function falls below a given thresh-
old l which is usually set to about 1% (i.e. ftarget < l ≈ 0.01). If this is achieved
the parameters are deemed to be satisfactory. It does not make sense to repro-
duce experimental data more closely because the typical simulation error limits
the reliability anyway.
In addition, the target values themselves carry some
uncertainty.

If the desired accuracy l is not achieved and the simplex ends up in a local
minimum the algorithm is aborted. Therefore, the highest and lowest value of
the target function in the actual simplex are compared. Hence, if

max(ftarget) − min(ftarget) < δf ≈ 0.001

(7)

5

is achieved further optimization makes no sense. In this case, either the num-
ber of parameters is too small to reproduce the desired number of properties
(overdetermination) or the appropriate parameter values are far oﬀ the initial
guess. We note that other convergence and abortion criteria are possible, for
example based on the size of the simplex. However, ours have proven to work
well in practice.

2.6 Implementation

The parts of the algorithm were implemented in diﬀerent programming lan-
guages. The backbone is a tcsh script which calls all auxiliary programs and
controls the overall ﬂow of the procedure. It uses standard UNIX utilities like
awk. The routine for producing a new topology from a set of parameters is a
PERL script whereas the programs for calculating the distance in parameter
space and the determination of equilibration are implemented in C++. Several
programs from the YASP simulation package [9] are used: the MD program
itself as well as the utilities for calculating enthalpy of vaporization and density.
Any program or utility may be easily exchanged without aﬀecting the overall
structure, e. g.
for using another MD program or a diﬀerent equilibration
scheme.

The structure of the procedure for obtaining a function value from a given

set of parameters is shown in the ﬂow diagram in ﬁgure 2.

3 Examples

The optimization procedure was tested with diﬀerent model systems in order to
explore its ability to produce force ﬁelds.

The all-atom nonbonded force ﬁeld consists of a Lennard-Jones 12-6 poten-
tial and an electrostatic potential using reaction ﬁeld and a ﬁnite cutoﬀ (of

The bond lengths were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm [11, 12].
Our systems are subject to cubic periodic boundary conditions. The simulations
were run at ambient conditions (T=298 K, p=1013 hPa). The neighbor-list [10]
is calculated up to 1.0nm every 10 to 15 time-steps. We use the Berendsen
algorithm for constant pressure and temperature [13]. The coupling times were
0.2 ps and 2 ps, respectively. The simulation runs lasted 50 ps at a timestep of
1 fs for each equilibration run and 100 ps at a timestep of 2 fs for the evaluation
runs. The errors of the properties were obtained by a binning analysis [10].

3.1 Methylpentane

As a ﬁrst test, a system of 125 uncharged 2-methylpentane molecules was op-
timized with respect to density ρ and enthalpy of vaporization ∆Hvap. All
Lennard-Jones parameters are subject to optimization. However, all like atoms
(C and H) are constrained to have the same LJ parameters. The internal part
of the force ﬁeld is taken from the AMBER force ﬁeld [6] and kept ﬁxed.

We used the following parameter ﬁle to start the algorithm. The number
“4” in the second line indicates the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Figure 3a) shows the whole optimization run. The circles show the results of
function evaluations and the solid line shows the current best values of ftarget.
In the beginning, the function values scatter quite strongly. In the run of the
algorithm, this starts to decrease. Figure 3b) shows how density and enthalpy
of vaporization reach their target values. The only maintenance which had to
be done was restarting the algorithm after a shutdown of the computer system.
The whole algorithm proved to be stable and worked fully automatically. Only
once the equilibration failed due to exceeding the limit of 10 runs. It is shown
by the spike in ﬁgure 3 (which goes up to 100000). The ﬁnal force ﬁeld is shown
in table I. These values reproduced the experimental data in a satisfactory way
(table II).

partial charges but oxygen and carbon did. The charges of the carbons 2 and 5
and the carbons 3 and 4 are the same for symmetry reasons. With the constraint
of electroneutrality, there were two charge parameters to be optimized. We chose
qO and qC2/C5, then we have qC3/C4 = 1
2 (−qO − 2qC2/C5). Additionally,
the oxygen parameters ǫO and σO were included in the optimization. The ﬁrst
guess for the partial charges was taken from a quantum chemical Hartree-Fock
calculation with a 6-311G** basis set using Gaussian 94 (Mulliken charges with
hydrogens summed into heavy atoms) [14]. This yielded also the bond angle
values. The bond lengths are taken from electron diﬀraction [5]. The simulated
system contained 216 molecules. The electrostatic interactions were simulated
with a reaction ﬁeld correction (ǫRF = 7.5) using the same cutoﬀ rc = 0.9 nm as
for the Lennard-Jones potential. Here the following starting simplex was taken:

The ﬁrst optimization attempt, which tried to optimize procedure the above
parameters, ended up in a local minimum with ftarget ≈ 0.07 after 53 evaluations
because the experimental liquid density could not be reproduced satisfactorily.
It was systematically too low. Therefore, the best parameters so far were frozen
and a new optimization was started where only the Lennard-Jones radii of all
species were optimized. Finally, convergence (ftarget ≤ 0.01) was achieved. The
resulting THF force ﬁeld is described in table III. These parameters lead to
the physical properties shown in table IV. Our force ﬁeld has about the same
accuracy as an earlier Monte Carlo simulation of a united atom OPLS model
for THF [15].

3.3 Cyclic Hydrocarbons

Finally, the method was applied in order to obtain force ﬁelds for cyclohexene
and cyclohexane with 125 molecules in the periodic box. The geometries were
taken from electron diﬀraction data [5]. The geometric data are shown in table
V. In the cyclohexene force ﬁeld, harmonic dihedral angles are used in order
to keep the atoms around the double bond in plane, since the sp2 hybridisa-
tion prevents the double bond from rotating. Additionally, standard torsional
potentials with three-fold symmetry are used. Cyclohexane was simulated with-
out any dihedral angle potentials. For the angular force constants we used a
standard value, since they are believed to be of minor importance for the de-
sired properties. Additionally, they may be compensated by the nonbonded
parameters.

The optimized Lennard-Jones 12-6 parameters are shown in table VI. The
parameters included in the optimization procedure are denoted with opt in the

table. No charges were used. All the parameters which are not optimized as
well as the initial simplices have been taken from similar force ﬁelds.

Except for the Lennard-Jones ǫ of the hydrogens, the resulting ﬁnal pa-
rameters are very similar for the two molecules. This shows that force ﬁeld
parameters are not a unique description of a certain atom type but rather they
are only a part of the overall molecular description. Mostly, however, the same
atoms in similar environments may be described by similar parameters.

We compare our thermodynamic data with experiment in table VII. A more
detailed analysis of transport properties of these cyclic hydrocarbons will be
published elsewhere [16]. The cyclohexane force ﬁeld yields a slightly better
comparison to experiment than in a recent study using a commercial force ﬁeld
[8] whereas the study of cyclohexene is the ﬁrst to our knowledge.

4 Conclusions

We applied the simplex algorithm to the problem of force ﬁeld optimization for
MD simulations. Given a good initial guess for the force ﬁeld parameters and
the experimental data for some properties, our method tunes the parameters to
optimum values. Once the routine has been set up, very little human interference
is required for maintenance. The algorithm proved to be robust and found local
minima if set up properly. The resulting force ﬁelds are able to reproduce

experimental data of low molecular weight liquids in a satisfactorily.

In the examples of this contribution, we typically optimized 4 force ﬁeld
parameters against 2 observables. Hence, the solutions are most likely not
unique. This, however, is a feature of the problem of ﬁnding a force ﬁeld given
a small number of observables, not of the algorithmic solution presented here.
Density and enthalpy of vaporization are the two properties most commonly
used to derive force ﬁelds, as they are experimentally available for many ﬂuids
and quickly converging in a simulation. At present, our method has to be
used with a judicious choice of starting values for the parameters to prevent it
from optimizing towards an unphysical, non-transferable set of parameters. It
shares this restriction with all other methods of ﬁnding force ﬁelds, including
“optimization by hand”. On the other hand, it is mostly not diﬃcult to come
up with a reasonable ﬁrst guess for the parameters. What is time consuming is
the ﬁne tuning and it is at this point where our method oﬀers help.

A possible way out of the dilemma is to increase the base of experimental
observables used in the target function. In a few selected cases we have used
other liquid properties than ρ and ∆Hvap together with the other reﬁnement
scheme [1, 2]. However, one has to note that there are not too many suitable
ﬂuid properties. Some properties are of similar character to what we already
have. For example, the excess chemical potential µex probes almost the same
regions of the force ﬁeld as ∆Hvap and, thus, does not add much independent
information. Dynamic properties often converge too slowly in simulations to
be useful (shear viscosity, dielectric constant) or the experimental data are not
of suﬃcient quality (tracer diﬀusion coeﬃcient, molecular reorientation times).
We, therefore, follow the strategy of optimizing towards ρ and ∆Hvap and sub-
sequently checking the ﬁnal force ﬁeld against other liquid properties. For our
models of cyclic hydrocarbons we have, for instance, calculated tracer and bi-
nary diﬀusion coeﬃcients as well as molecular reorientation times for both the
pure liquids and binary mixtures, and the results agree well with experimental
data where available [16].

The automatic parameterization scheme presented has the small disadvan-
tage of probably requiring moderately more computer time than an optimiza-
tion by hand. This is more than oﬀset by the invaluable advantage of freeing
researchers from the labour of parameter optimization. In a reasonable use of
computing time (a few weeks workstation time) one is able to cope with dimen-
sionalities of parameter space of about 4. This depends, however, strongly on
the actual simulations to be performed. On the other hand, the full potential of
speeding up our algorithm has not yet been realized. We foresee possibilities of
substantial improvement by using a less rigorous and maybe adaptive equilibra-
tion scheme and by substituting the simplex algorithm by a faster converging
optimizer (e.g. Fletcher) in the ﬁnal stages of minimization. This remains an
interesting starting point for future research.

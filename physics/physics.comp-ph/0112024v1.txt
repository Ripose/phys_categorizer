The quasilinearization method (QLM) of solving nonlinear diﬀerential equations is applied to the quantum mechanics by
casting the Schr¨odinger equation in the nonlinear Riccati form. The method, whose mathematical basis in physics was discussed
recently by one of the present authors (VBM), approaches the solution of a nonlinear diﬀerential equation by approximating
the nonlinear terms by a sequence of the linear ones, and is not based on the existence of some kind of a small parameter. It
is shown that the quasilinearization method gives excellent results when applied to computation of ground and excited bound
state energies and wave functions for a variety of the potentials in quantum mechanics most of which are not treatable with the
help of the perturbation theory or the 1/N expansion scheme. The convergence of the QLM expansion of both energies and
wave functions for all states is very fast and already the ﬁrst few iterations yield extremely precise results. The precison of the
wave function is typically only one digit inferior to that of the energy. In addition it is veriﬁed that the QLM approximations,
unlike the asymptotic series in the perturbation theory and the 1/N expansions are not divergent at higher orders.

INTRODUCTION

Realistic physical calculations usually are impossible without diﬀerent approximation techniques. Correspondingly
expansions in small parameters, statistical, variational and majority of numerical methods belong to the arsenal of
the modern physics.

Since many equations of physics are either nonlinear or could be cast in the nonlinear form, the possibility of
adding to this arsenal an additional very powerful approximation technique applicable to nonlinear problems was
pointed out in a series of recent papers [1, 2, 3]. It is called the quasilinearization method (QLM) and its iterations
are constructed to yield rapid quadratic convergence and often monotonicity. The quasilinearization method was
developed many years ago in theory of linear programming by Bellman and Kalaba [4, 5] as a generalization of the
Newton-Raphson method [6, 7] to solve the systems of nonlinear ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations.
Its
modern developments and examples of applications to diﬀerent ﬁelds of science and engineering are given in a recent
monograph [8].

In the original works of Bellman and Kalaba [4, 5], however, the convergence of the method has been proven only
under rather restrictive conditions of small intervals and bounded, nonsingular forces [1] which generally are not
fulﬁlled in physical applications. This could explain an extremely sparse use of the technique in physics, where only
a few examples of the references to it could be found [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Recently, however, it was shown [1] by one
of the present authors (VBM) that a diﬀerent proof of the convergence can be provided which allows to extend the
applicability of the method to realistic forces deﬁned on inﬁnite intervals with possible singularities at certain points.
This proof was generalized and elaborated in the subsequent works [2, 3].

In the ﬁrst paper of the series [1], the analytic results of the quasilinearization approach were applied to the nonlinear
Calogero equation [9] for the scattering length in the variable phase approach to quantum mechanics, and the results
were compared with those of the perturbation theory and with the exact solutions. It was shown that the n-th QLM
approximation sums exactly 2n
1 terms of the perturbation theory while a similar number of terms are summed
approximately. The number of the exactly reproduced perturbation terms thus doubles with each subsequent QLM
approximation, which, of course, is a direct consequence of a quadratic convergence.

−

The numerical calculation of higher QLM approximations to solutions of the Calogero equation with diﬀerent
singular and nonsingular, attractive and repulsive potentials performed in the next work [2] has shown that already
the ﬁrst few iterations provide accurate and numerically stable answers for any values of the coupling constant and
that the number of iterations necessary to reach a given precision increases only slowly with the coupling strength. It
was veriﬁed that the method provides accurate and stable answers even for super singular potentials for which each
term of the perturbation theory diverges and the perturbation expansion consequently does not exist.

In the third paper of the series [3] the quasilinearization method was applied to other well known typical nonlinear
ordinary diﬀerential equations in physics, such as the Blasius, Duﬃng, Lane-Emden and Thomas-Fermi equations
which have been and still are extensively studied in the literature. These equations, unlike the nonlinear Calogero
equation for the scattering length [9] considered in references [1, 2], contain not only quadratic nonlinear terms but
various other forms of nonlinearity and not only the ﬁrst, but also higher derivatives. It was shown that again just a
small number of the QLM iterations yield fast convergent and uniformly excellent and stable numerical results.

The goal of the present work is to apply the quasilinearization method to quantum mechanics by casting the
Schr¨odinger equation in the nonlinear Riccati form and calculating the QLM approximations to bound state energies
and wave functions for a variety of potentials, most of which are not treatable with the help of the perturbation
theory or the 1/N expansion scheme. We show that the convergence of the QLM expansion for both energies and
wave functions is very fast and that already the ﬁrst few iterations yield extremely precise results. In addition it is
veriﬁed that the higher QLM approximations, unlike those in 1/N expansion method, are not divergent at any order.
in the second chapter we present the main features of the quasilinearization
approach to the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation, while in the third chapter we consider the application of the
method to computations for the Coulomb, Hulthen, P¨oschl-Teller, logarithmic, double-well, anharmonic oscillator,
linear and diﬀerent power potentials such as r3/2 and r5. The results and their comparison with other calculations,
convergence patterns, numerical stability, advantages of the method and its possible future applications are discussed
in the ﬁnal, forth chapter.

The paper is arranged as follows:

II. QUASILINEARIZATION APPROACH TO THE SOLUTION OF THE SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

The quasilinearization method (QLM) solves a nonlinear n-th order ordinary or partial diﬀerential equation in N
dimensions as a limit of a sequence of linear diﬀerential equations. The idea and advantage of the method is based
on the fact that linear equations can often be solved analytically or numerically using superposition principle while
there are no useful techniques for obtaining the general solution of a nonlinear equation in terms of a ﬁnite set of
particular solutions.

The main feartures and equations of the method, appropriate for physics applications, are summed in Refs. [1, 2, 3].
In this paper we will follow these references since the derivation there is not based, unlike the derivation in Refs.
[4, 5], on the smallness of the interval and on the boundedness of the nonlinear term and its functional derivatives,
the conditions which usually are not fulﬁlled in physics.

We would like to use the method in quantum mechanical calculations with the central potential V (r). In order to

do this we have to rewrite the corresponding radial Schr¨odinger equation

It is easy to check that the inverse dimensionless logarithmic derivative φ of the wave function,

satisﬁes the nonlinear Riccati equations

where x = κr and W (x) = U (x/κ)/κ2 are the dimensionless variable and potential, respectively.

To avoid poles of φ(x) at the bound state energies it is convenient to deﬁne (see [1, 2] and the references therein)

a new function u(x) with the help of the equation

The corresponding equations for u(x) have the forms

φ(x) =

respectively, for the function u(x) therefore read

Here and in Eq. (16) n obviously denotes the number of the excited state with n = 1 corresponding to the ground
state, n = 2 to the ﬁrst excited state etc. The minus sign in front of n follows from the fact that in the regions of r
where V (r) < E in view of Eqs. (13) and (14) the derivative du/dx is negative and u(x) is decreasing. Since its value
at the origin is zero u(x) stays negative which determines the sign in front of n.

Returning to the variable r and deﬁning a new function a(r) which has the dimension of length with the help of

the relation φ(x) = κ(r + a(r)) and substituting it into Eqs. (10) and (11) we obtain the equations

which are very similar to the Calogero equation

establishes the monotonicity of the convergence from below (above), respectively. The exact conditions of the con-
vergence and the monotonicity for the realistic physical conditions of forces deﬁned on inﬁnite intervals with possible
singularities at certain points are formulated in Ref. [1]. One can also prove [9] that in the quasilinear approximation
the energy in the Schr¨odinger equation satisﬁes the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle which ensures the quadratic
convergence in the QLM energy computations.

We will limit ourselves here to the bound state calculations with Eqs. (13) for the negative energy bound states
and (14) for positive energy bound states which are somewhat more complicated than scattering calculations since in
the former case the boundary condition at inﬁnity determines a discrete spectrum.

III. QLM BOUND STATE CALCULATIONS AND THEIR COMPARISON WITH THE 1/N
EXPANSION METHOD AND EXACT SOLUTIONS

In the previous chapter we have cast the Schr¨odinger equation in the nonlinear Riccati form and wrote the lin-
ear equations and the boundary conditions appropriate for the bound state calculations with the quasilinearization
method.

In this chapter we consider examples of diﬀerent singular and nonsingular attractive interactions which, in view of
their large coupling constants, are not treatable with the help of the perturbation theory and for most of which the
1/N expansion series are asymptotically divergent as has been shown in Ref. [14].

Namely, we apply the quasilinearization method to computations with the Coulomb, Hulthen, P¨oschl-Teller, log-
arithmic, anharmonic oscillator, linear and diﬀerent other power potentials such as r3/2 and r5 as well to the one-
dimensinal double-well potential (r2
16)2/128, and we compare the wave functions and the bound state energies
obtained by the quasilinearization method (QLM) with their exact values and with results obtained in the 1/N ex-
pansion theory. To show that the method works equally well also for excited states we calculate in the Coulomb,
linear and double well potentials the ﬁrst few excited states as well.

The calculations were done using the diﬀerential formulation, Eq. (25), of the QLM iteration, for the simple reason
that the adaptive numerical integration [23] together with interpolation proved faster than the integral formulation
(26), mainly due to the processor time taken by the evaluation of the exponential in Eq. (26). For each QLM iteration
number k, k = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . km, numerical integration was performed from x = 0 to the matching point x = xm and
from the upper bound x = xU to x = xm.

Let us denote the set of iteration-integration parameters by

, where km is the maximum QLM
iteration index, xU is the upper bound of the interval, and Ni is the number of interpolation points in each of the two
subintervals (0, xm) and (xm, xU).

The computation was done in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, xm, the starting values of parameters,

0, and a κ value,
κ0, near the expected eigenvalue were prescribed. On the last QLM iteration (k = km) the absolute diﬀerence between

was calculated. The whole process was then performed with a new set of parameters
1, where km, xU, etc. were
increased. This was repeated until some number M of steps, when DPM (κ0; xm) was stabilized to a required accuracy.
PM thus optimized was used to ﬁnd the zero of DPM (κ; xm) = 0 as a function
of κ: the QLM iteration was ﬁrst performed for two κ values lying on opposite sides of the expected eigenvalue, and
the QLM iteration (k = 1, 2, 3, . . .) was then repeated for each new κ value until DPM (κ; xm) = 0.

In the second step, the parameter set

In this process the value of xm was kept constant, which had the consequence that the RHS interval (xm, xU) was
increasing. Both solutions tend to become unstable near x = xm on their respective sides, if the respective interval
is too large. It turned out however that it was possible to leave xm unchanged, except that xm typically had to
increase with the number of the excited state. On the other hand, as is evident from the Figures, the starting values
of parameters (
0), in particular km, had to be large enough to overcome the divergent behavior of the solutions near
0. It also turned out that the RHS solution quickly assumes the correct
x = xm already for the QLM iteration using
value, thus allowing reasonably small xU, and actually making the process rather independent of the exact value used
for the boundary condition at inﬁnity.

The precision was controlled in the following way. The diﬀerential equation solver [23] was required to return u(x)
was 10−PP .

with the precision of the order of 10−PODE. The required precision of DP during the optimization of
PODE was taken to be larger than PP by 1 to 3 to test stability.

P

The results of the calculations are summarized in Table I and in Figs. 1-15. The calculations are done for the
s-states since the calculations for p, d states etc. have the same degree of diﬃculty and could be performed in a
similar fashion. In the caption of the table V (r) is the potential and n denotes the number of the excited state; m is
the mass of the particle and is given diﬀerent values for diﬀerent potentials in order to enable comparison of the QLM
bound state energies with those obtained by the 1/N expansion method in Ref. [14] where m takes on values m = 1
or 1/2 depending on the interaction. In the graphs of the convergence of uk(x) with iteration index k we present
for clarity only those iterations which are distinguishable from the ﬁnal solution (k = km) on the graphs; the actual
number of iterations is higher in order to achieve greater wave function precision. Figures which display the absolute
diﬀerences between successive iterations,

The required precision of u(x), or the wave function, was PODE = 9 in all cases except in the logaritmic potential
case where PODE = 6. The number of digits in the values of E in Table I is the number of stable digits when PP was
increased up to PODE + 3, except in the cases of Coulomb, P¨oschl-Teller and H¨ulthen potentials, where we display an
additional (the ﬁrst incorrect) digit.

From Table I and Figs. 1-15 one can conclude that QLM is extremely precise. Energies and the wave function
for both ground end excited states typically converge to the order of 10 signiﬁcant digits after about km = 10
20
iterations though the precision of E is about one digit more than the precision of the wave function. We used
the numbers of QLM iterations km such that the precision of the iteration itself, shown by the Figures displaying

IV. CONCLUSION

Our calculations conﬁrm numerically the conclusion following from the proof in Ref. [3] that once the quasilinear
iteration sequence starts to converge, it will continue to do so, unlike the perturbation expansions in powers of the
coupling constant or in powers of 1/N , which are often given by the asymptotic series and therefore converge only up
to a certain order and diverge thereafter. In particular, the 1/N expansions of the binding energy of diﬀerent ground
and excited states given in Table I, are strongly divergent for logarithmic, double-well, anharmonic oscillator, linear,
r3/2 and r5 potentials at orders of about 20 or higher or even before this as it was shown recently by Bjerrum-Bohr
[14].

Based on our results of the QLM computations of the wave functions and bound state energies for many diﬀerent
potentials, one can deduce the following important features of the quasilinearization method in the quantum mechanics:

(i) The quasilinearization method solves the Schr¨odinger equation by rewriting it in the nonlinear Riccati form and
by approximating the nonlinear terms by a sequence of the linear ones. It is not based, unlike perturbation or
1/N expansion theories, on the existence of some kind of small parameter.

(ii) The quasilinearization method works equally well for both ground and excited states. It is extremely precise:
binding energies and the wave functions converge to the order of 10 signiﬁcant digits after about 10
20 iterations.
Typically, the numerically obtained precison of the wave function is only one digit inferior to that of the energy.

−

7

(iii) Fast convergence of the QLM iterations to the exact solution conﬁrms numerically the uniform and quadratic
law of convergence proved in Refs. [1, 2, 3] for realistic physical interactions deﬁned on inﬁnite intervals with
possible singularities at certain points of the intervals.

(iv) For convergence it is enough that an initial guess for the zeroth iteration is suﬃciently good. In all the examples
considered in the paper the simplest initial guess of setting the logarithmic derivative of the wave function φ(x)
equal to zero or to x at the origin was enough to produce a rapid convergence.

(v) By using the high numbers of QLM iterations km such that the obtained iterative solution was extremely
accurate, up to 10−15, it was numerically conﬁrmed the statement earlier proved and veriﬁed in Ref. [3] that
once the quasilinear iteration sequence starts to converge, it will always continue to do so unlike the perturbation
or 1/N expansion series, which are asymptotically divergent. The quasilinearization method therefore always
yields the required precision once a successful initial guess generates convergence after a few steps.

In view of all this, the quasilinearization method appears to be extremely useful in quantum mechanics and in
many cases more advantageous than the perturbation theory or its diﬀerent modiﬁcations, like expansion in inverse
powers of the coupling constant, the 1/N expansion, etc. Though in this work only central potentials and one
dimensional double well potential were considered and thus only diﬀerential equations in one variable were treated,
the quailinearization method is able to solve the systems of nonlinear ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations in N
variables and could therefore be applicable to the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation with the noncentral potentials
or to the N -body Schr¨odinger in 3N

3 dimensions which will be subject of the future research.

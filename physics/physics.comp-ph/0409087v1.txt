Computation of ionic forces using quantum Monte Carlo methods has long been a challenge. We
introduce a simple procedure, based on known properties of physical electronic densities, to make
the variance of the Hellmann-Feynman estimator ﬁnite. We obtain very accurate geometries for the
molecules H2, LiH, CH4, NH3, H2O and HF, with a Slater-Jastrow trial wave function. Harmonic
frequencies for diatomics are also in good agreement with experiment. An antithetical sampling
method is also discussed for additional reduction of the variance.

The optimization of molecular geometries and crys-
tal structures and ab initio molecular dynamics simula-
tions are among the most signiﬁcant achievements of sin-
gle particle theories. These accomplishments were both
possible thanks to the possibility of readily computing
forces on the ions within the framework of the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation. The approximate treat-
ment of electron interactions typical of these approaches
can, however, lead to quantitatively, and sometimes qual-
itatively, wrong results. This fact, together with a favor-
able scaling of the computational cost with respect to
the number of particles, has spurred the development of
stochastic techniques, i.e. quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
methods. Despite the higher accuracy achievable for
many physical properties, the lack of an eﬃcient estima-
tor for forces has prevented, until recently[1, 2, 3], the use
of QMC methods to predict even the simplest molecular
geometry. The chief problem is to have a Monte Carlo
(MC) estimator for the force with suﬃciently small vari-
ance. For example, in all-electron calculations, a straight-
forward application of MC sampling of the Hellmann-
Feynman estimator has inﬁnite variance. This can be
easily seen from the deﬁnition of the force. For a nu-
cleus of charge Z at the origin, the force can be written,
together with its variance, as a function of the charge
density ρ(r) as

F = Z

Since the electronic density is ﬁnite at the origin, the
variance integral diverges.

In this paper, we propose a modiﬁed form for the
force estimator which has ﬁnite variance. This estima-
tor is then used to calculate forces and predict equilib-
rium geometry and vibrational frequencies for a set of
small molecules. Without loss of generality we will con-
sider only the z-component of the force on an atom at

the origin.
In a QMC calculation based in conﬁgura-
tion space, the charge density is a sum of delta func-
r′ δ(r − r′), where the sum is over all
tions: ρ(r) ∝
Ne electron positions and all MC samples. We consider
separately the electrons within a distance R of the atom
and those outside. The contribution to the force from
charges outside, F O
z , can be calculated directly with the
Hellmann-Feynman estimator in Eq. (1). The contribu-
tion from inside the sphere is responsible for the large
variances in the direct estimator. It is convenient to in-
troduce a “force density” deﬁned as the force arising from
electron charges at a distance r from the origin:

fz(r) = Z

dΩ ρ(r, θ, φ) cos θ

(2)

Then the force is given as:

Z

Fz = F O

z +

fz(r)dr.

The force density is a smooth function of r that tends to 0
linearly as r approaches the origin. The force density for
H in a LiH molecule computed with Hartree-Fock and two
diﬀerent QMC estimators is shown in Fig.1. As expected
the bare force estimator ﬂuctuates wildly at small r.

Because the force density is a smooth function, we can

represent it in the interval (0, R) with a polynomial

where rm is a weight factor used to balance contributions
from diﬀerent values of r.

Since the relation between the force and the force den-
sity is linear, and the relation between the ﬁtting coeﬃ-
cients and the electronic density is linear, we can directly
write the force as averages over moments of the force den-
sity. After some manipulations we arrive at:

The points at negative imaginary time give the VMC values.
Values at 0 are the mixed estimates of the DMC simulation.

Note that for the bare estimator g(r) = θ(R − r). Be-
cause of the restriction on the basis, the variance of the
new estimator is ﬁnite as long as m > −1/2. We have nu-
merically found that the weighting factor m = 2, where
each volume element is weighted equally, gives the lowest
variance estimate of the force.

To derive the estimator we have used the fact that

property that allows to ﬁlter out the s-wave component
of the density responsible for the variance divergence.
The original estimator is correct for any arbitrary charge
density while the new ﬁltered one uses physical proper-
ties of the charge density to reduce the variance. The
variance depends on the ﬁtting radius R and on the ba-
sis set size M . As R increases, the size of the basis must
increase, which increases the variance. Charge densities
corresponding to low energy states must be smooth and
we typically ﬁnd that only 2 or 3 basis functions are
needed. The size of the basis can be reduced by using
more appropriate basis sets. For example, in all calcula-
tions reported below we used the expansion

where f SD is the force density of a single determinant
wave function, which can be readily computed from the
orbitals. The improved basis allows a smaller polyno-
mial set and a reduction of the variance. In Fig. 2 the
dependence of the bias on the basis set type and size is
shown for the case of a variational Monte Carlo (VMC)
simulation on LiH at a bond length of 3.316 Bohr.

The trial wave functions ΨT used in all cases were of
the Slater-Jastrow form. The orbitals were obtained from
a Hartree-Fock calculation using CRYSTAL98 [4]. The
electron-electron and electron-proton Jastrow factors had
the form of exp(ar/(1 + br)), with a and b optimized

by minimizing |Eloc − hEi| [5] over points sampled from
|ΨT |2. The time step in the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
simulations was chosen to give an acceptance ratio of
98%, a value for which the time step bias on forces was
within the statistical error bars.

Since the exact density is needed for the Hellmann-
Feynman theorem, forward walking[8] or one of the varia-
tional path integral algorithms[9, 10] is needed in order to
evaluate the force estimator. An example of the conver-
gence of forward walking is shown in Fig. 3. The force as
a function of the forward-walking projection time quickly
reaches a plateau corresponding to the exact value. In
this example, the variational forces are far from correct.
This discrepancy results from the lack of full optimization
of the trial wave function made of localized basis orbitals
and atom centered Jastrow factors, and can be reduced
somewhat by including Pulay terms [2]. In DMC, forward
walking eliminates the need for the Pulay corrections.

The equilibrium geometries were computed by ﬁtting
the QMC forces in the proximity of the equilibrium ge-
ometry to a polynomial with the appropriate symmetry.
Fig. 4 shows the force in hydrogen ﬂuoride in a 2% in-
terval around the equilibrium geometry. The equilib-
rium geometries are reported in Table I together with
those given by CCSD(T), DFT using the B3LYP and
the PBE functional, and experiments. The diﬀerences
between QMC and experimental values are in all cases
less than 0.4% and closer to the experiment than the
other techniques. For diatomics it is easy to provide an
estimate of the harmonic vibrational frequencies start-
ing from the derivative of the force curve at equilibrium
geometry. The QMC frequencies, reported in Table II,
are in good agreement with the experiment, with errors
comparable to that from CCSD(T) and DFT-GGA. This
suggests that forces computed within our approach are
accurate also away from the equilibrium and could be
used in molecular dynamics calculations or to optimize
molecular geometries.

that cannot be simply addressed is the ﬁxed-node er-
ror. In ﬁxed-node DMC, the random walk is forbidden to
cross the nodes of the trial wavefunction in order to pre-
vent the loss of eﬃciency due to the fermion antisymme-
try. If the nodes are accurate, so is the QMC energy and
electronic density; hence the force. For incorrect nodes,
the energy is an upper bound to the true energy, but such
can not be said for the force. It is also not necessarily the
case that the forces obtained from Eq. (1) are equal to
the gradient of the ﬁxed-node energy[11, 12, 13]: this is
only guaranteed in the limit of exact nodal surfaces. The
high quality of the geometries and vibrational frequencies
suggests that these errors, at least for the cases treated
in this paper, are negligible. This is perhaps not surpris-
ing, since the electronic density is a 1-electron property,
while the nodal error is a many-body eﬀect.

We have also tested another method to further reduce
the variance of the Hellmann-Feynman estimator. The
ﬁltered estimator performs well on the hydrogen atom
but for heavier nuclei the error bar grows and seems to
scale as Z 3. In those cases the new method can poten-
tially be very useful, with error bars that scale as Z 1−2.
The method is based on the observation that, while elec-
trons in the core cause large ﬂuctuations in the force
density, they contribute very little to it. A standard ap-
proach to reduce the variance of a Monte Carlo estimate
is the use of antithetic variates[15]: a positive ﬂuctuation
is paired with a negative ﬂuctuation. Suppose the ran-
dom walk arrives at a multidimensional electronic conﬁg-
uration R, with p (≥ 1) electrons inside a radius Rav ≤ R
of an atom located at the origin. We obtain an antithetic
conﬁguration R′ by reﬂecting all p core electrons about
the origin. We then estimate the force using both R and
R′, assigning a weight factor of w(R′) = |ψ(R′)/ψ(R)|2
to R′. Their joint contribution to the estimator in Eq. (6)
is Z 1−w(R′
Ne
i=1 g(ri)zir−3. Since w → 1 as Rav → 0,
ﬂuctuations in the core are much reduced.

Within VMC this scheme can be implemented exactly,
leading to a dramatic reduction of the variance as can be
noticed from Fig. 1. However this estimator is non-local
and, in DMC, suﬀers from the same problems as non-
local pseudopotentials, making an unbiased implementa-
tion not straightforward. We postpone further discussion
of the antithetic method to a future article.

Two other approaches have been introduced recently
for the computation of forces in QMC. Filippi and Um-
rigar have computed forces for diatomics by correlating
random walks for interatomic separations a and a′. In
DMC the diﬃculty associated with the nodal error and
the branching factor was overcome by neglecting some
types of correlation. The main drawback of a ﬁnite dif-
ference method is the diﬃculty of calculating all the com-
ponents of the force simultaneously; this method would
require 3N separate force calculations.

4

The other approach, introduced in Ref. [3], is closer to
our method. It is based on a “zero-variance” version of
the Hellmann-Feynman estimator and can be understood
in the framework of this paper: one can prove that it
corresponds to ﬁltering out the s-wave component of the
density leaving the force density unchanged. The semi-
local character of the “zero-variance” estimator makes its
DMC implementation trickier. To overcome this problem
there have been attempts[2, 16] to use correction terms
similar in nature to the Pulay terms in single-particle ap-
proaches. In practice, this scheme requires extensive op-
timization and, although promising, it is unclear if it will
be viable for more complicated cases. In addition, the
value of the force is very sensitive to small errors[16] in
the charge density and the optimization within a stochas-
tic technique is probably not suﬃciently stable to elimi-
nate these errors.

In conclusion, we have developed a simple method for
computing forces within quantum Monte Carlo and used
it to ﬁnd the equilibrium geometries for small polyatomic
molecules. This has been the ﬁrst time that a QMC
technique is used to predict geometries of molecules be-
yond diatomics. The only overhead in the calculation is
the necessity of determining unbiased estimators, which
requires the use of either forward-walking or reptation
MC techniques. The new method leads to very accu-
rate forces despite errors from the ﬁxed-node approxima-
tion and from its contribution to the energy derivatives.
Extension of the method, including the antithetic esti-
mator technique, to heavier atoms and to atoms with
pseudopotentials[18]is under investigation.

a density matrix and a corresponding force density can
be deﬁned by summing over partial waves.

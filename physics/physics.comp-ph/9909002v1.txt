(the Pian–Sumihara basis) as a linear basis to approximate stress leads to greater
eﬃciency in enhanced strain problems, is presented. An Airy stress function and the
consequent selective simpliﬁcation resulting from the diﬀerentiation of an implied,
single, parent approximating polynomial, are the essence of this argument.

1 Introduction

Pian and Sumihara ﬁrst identiﬁed the basis

as the most eﬃcient linear basis for approximating stress in enhanced strain problems.
This observation they made more rigorous by way of a Wilson element (a perturbation
of sorts).

This paper presents a logical mathematical argument for making the same choice of basis,
albeit with the wisdom of hindsight. It attributes the greater eﬃciency of the basis to
properties inherent in the mathematics of the problem. The components of the stress
tensor are recognised to be related by way of an Airy stress function and it is in this way
that a fundamentally more correct representation of the full linear basis is arrived at. By
further desiring the advantages of a two ﬁeld problem, the most eﬃcient, linear basis is
obtained.

2 An Airy Stress Function

The Airy stress function is a potential of sorts. Interpreting stresses to be the various sec-
ond derivatives of a single polynomial leads to selective simpliﬁcation and interdependence
between the resulting linear approximations. This simpliﬁcation and the interdependence
are not obvious in a more superﬁcial treatment.

∂x

+

∂σ12
∂y

= 0

and

∂σ21
∂x

+

∂σ22
∂y

= 0

This is recogniseable as

curl(−σ12, σ11, 0) = 0

and

curl(σ22, −σ21, 0) = 0.

This, in turn, implies that (−σ12, σ11, 0) and (σ22, −σ21, 0) may be interpretted as ∇α
and ∇β respectively, without any inconsistancy in the

identity.

By symmetry of σ,

curl ∇( · ) = 0

σ12 = σ21 ⇒ ∂α
∂x

− ∂β
∂y

= 0

and for a two dimensional problem of the type under consideration this once again implies

(β, α, 0) may therefore be interpretted as ∇Φ without any inconsistancy in the

identity.

In summary, with an equation

governing the motion, in the two-dimensional case, the components of the stress may be
derived from an Airy stress function as follows

curl(β, α, 0) = 0.

3 The Relationship Implicit in the Linear Approxi-

mation

Since linear approximations of σ11 are to be considered,

∂2φ
∂η2 = b1 + b2ξ + b3η

where b1, b2 and b3 are the relevant combining constants. This means

φ(ξ, η) =

b1 + b2ξ + b3η dηdη

in which the exact form of ηf1(η) + f2(η) remains to be determined. Similarly, approxi-
mating σ22 as some multiple of b4 + b5ξ + b6η implies this very same polynomial function

φ(ξ, η) =

b4 + b5ξ + b6η dξdξ

(by Airy stress function)

in which the exact form of g2(η) is determined by equation (1). This equation in turn
speciﬁes f2(ξ) in equation (1). Approximating σ12 = σ21 in it’s turn as as b7 + b8ξ + b9η
implies the polynomial function

φ(ξ, η) =

b7 + b8ξ + b9η dξdη

where f2(ξ) and g2(η) have already been determined by equations (2) and (1) respectively.
This last expression for φ(ξ, η) also speciﬁes the, until now undetermined, ηf1(ξ) and
ξg1(η) in equations (1) and (2). In summary, collecting equations (1), (2) and (3) together
leads to the speciﬁcation of an implied, single parent approximating polynomial

φ(ξ, η) = c1 + c2ξ + c3η + c4ξ2 + c5ξη + c6η2 + c7ξ3 + c8ξ2η + c9ξη2 + c10η3.

Having established both the existance and nature of the relationship between the con-
stants in what were apparently seperate linear approximations,

solution of the problem in question.

Conclusion

The Airy stress function therefore reveals how a linear approximation of the components
of σ on each element really amounts to

4 Eliminating the Last Two Columns

The rank of the matrix in equation (4) indicates that there are still two extra columns.
The equation in which σ is used is a three–ﬁeld problem, in which the strain, γ, only
occurs once in a term σ ·γ. Choosing σ correctly would reduce the problem to a two–ﬁeld
problem since

is required in accordance with Reddy [3]. In other words

must always be zero. This is only certaint if the sixth and seventh columns of the stress
basis are omitted.

5 Conclusion

An Airy stress function and consequent simpliﬁcation resulting from the diﬀerentiation
of an implied, single, parent, approximating polynomial are able to provide a logical
explanation as to why the choice of

(the Pian–Sumihara basis) as a linear basis to approximate stress leads to greater eﬃ-

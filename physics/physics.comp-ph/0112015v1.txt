A numerical scheme for solving the time-evolution of wave functions under the time dependent
Kohn-Sham equation has been developed. Since the eﬀective Hamiltonian depends on the wave
functions, the wave functions and the eﬀective Hamiltonian should evolve consistently with each
other. For this purpose, a self-consistent loop is required at every time-step for solving the time-
evolution numerically, which is computationally expensive. However, in this paper, we develop a
diﬀerent approach expressing a formal solution of the TD-KS equation, and prove that it is possible
to solve the TD-KS equation eﬃciently and accurately by means of a simple numerical scheme
without the use of any self-consistent loops.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since the innovative work on the density functional
theory (DFT) [1] and the Kohn-Sham equation [2], many
kinds of static or adiabatic quantum electronic phenom-
ena have been investigated based on ﬁrst principles. As
an extension of the DFT to non-adiabatic dynamical phe-
nomena, the time-dependent density functional theory
(TD-DFT) has been developed [3,4]. By using the TD-
DFT, some excitation phenomena have been analyzed
more accurately than by using the DFT [5]. However, the
formulation of the TD-DFT is too complicated to solve
the wave functions numerically in order to see electron
dynamics directly. So a considerable approximate for-
mula called the TD-Kohn-Sham (TD-KS) equation has
been applied for the numerical simulations [6,7].

The diﬃculty in numerically solving the TD-KS equa-
tion is the treatment of the density-dependent Hamilto-
nian. The wave functions and the Hamiltonian should
always be self-consistent with each other. A fourth order
self-consistent iterative scheme was proposed by O. Sug-
ino and Y. Miyamoto [6]. However, the use of a SCF-loop
at every time-step is computationally expensive.

In this paper, we propose a new formalism for the nu-
merical solution of the TD-KS equation. Based it on,
we prove that a simple formula without SCF-loops can
solve the TD-KS equation with suﬃcient accuracy. We
ﬁnd that computational techniques [9,10] previously de-
veloped by us for the one-electron TD-Schr¨odinger equa-
tion in real space and real time are also useful for the
TD-KS equation.

II. CONVENTIONAL METHOD

The TD-KS equation is a mean ﬁeld approach used
for describing the time-evolution of the electron density
ρ via one-electron wave functions ψn under an eﬀective

V [ρ, t] = Vint[ρ] + Vext(t) ,

ρ(t) =

Here, V [ρ, t] is an eﬀective potential which represents the
internal mutual interactions Vint[ρ] and the external time-
dependent potential Vext(t). Throughout this paper, we
use the atomic unit ¯h = 1, m = 1, e = 1 for equations
and values.

Due to the time-dependence of the Hamiltonian, the
solution of the TD-KS equation can be formally ex-
pressed in terms of a time-ordering exponential operator:

There are many numerical methods for computing
Eq. (2). The simplest method discretizes the elapsed time
t into small time slices ∆t, and approximates Eq. (2) as

ψn(t + ∆t)

exp

i∆t

ψn(t) ,

and it is computed using the Runge-Kutta method, or by
the split operator technique:

(4)

However, this is not suﬃciently accurate, because it ig-
nores the time dependence of the Hamiltonian during the
small time slice, while the splitting reduces accuracy to
an even lower level.

Another well-known computational method for Eq. (2)

uses a Hamiltonian in the middle of the steps,

Here, V [ρ, t + ∆t/2] is estimated from an interpolation
between V [ρ, t] and V [ρ, t + ∆t]. Therefore, they have to
be solved by a self-consistent loop. This scheme is accu-
rate enough; however, it is computationally expensive to
perform the SCF-loop at every time-step.

III. FORMULATION

To avoid the use of a SCF-loop, we ﬁrst express the
time-evolution of wave functions using a Taylor develop-
ment in exponential form as

and ∂/∂tex means an explicate-time-derivative operator,
which operates only explicitly-time-dependent quantities.
By substituting the TD-KS equation (1) into Eq. (8),

the time-diﬀerential is generally expressed as

because ψn does not depend on ψ∗

Another example regards density ρ,

By substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (7), we can formally
write the solution without employing the time-ordering
operator as

(24)

By the way, Vint[ρ] does not depend on time explicitly,
because the density ρ does not depend on time explicitly
as shown in Eq. (12). Meanwhile, Vext(t) does depend on
time explicitly,

∂Vint[ρ]
∂tex

= 0 ,

∂Vext(t)
∂tex

= 0 .

(25)

As a result, we obtain the desired formula:

(27)

Here, Vext(t + ∆t/2) is the external force in the middle
of the steps. Meanwhile, ρ′ in Vint[ρ′] is not the density
in the middle of the steps, but it is the density after the
preceding operation, namely

(28)

Therefore, the formula (27) can be explicitly computed
without employing any SCF loops.

The present non-SCF formula (27) is quite similar with
the conventional non-SCF formula (4) and the conven-
tional SCF formula (6). However,
in this paper, we
have derived the formula based on the strict solution (13)
by considering the time-dependence of the Hamiltonian,
while the conventional non-SCF formula did not con-
sider the time-dependence. We can easily show that the
present non-SCF formula is as accurate as the conven-
tional SCF formula by associating ρ′ with ρ(t + ∆t) as,

Therefore, both the non-SCF formula and the SCF for-
mula are correct up to the second-order of ∆t.

IV. COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUE

Computational techniques previously developed by us
for the one-electron TD-Schr¨odinger equation [9,10] are
also beneﬁcial for formula (27). We discretize the wave
functions in real space, and use the ﬁnite element method

for spatial derivatives. The only diﬀerence in the scheme
for the TD-KS equation and TD-Schr¨odinger equation is
the exponential of the eﬀective potential:

′
n(r) = exp
ψ

∆t
i

h

Vint[ρ]
i

ψn(r) .

(30)

By this operation, the phase of the wave functions is al-
tered at each point, but the density ρ(r) is not altered.
Therefore, we take the value of Vint[ρ](r) as a constant
during the computation, which is calculated just before
the computation.

It is quite easy to improve the accuracy of formula (27)
to the fourth order. The fourth-order accurate formula
is given by Suzuki’s exponential product theory [8] as

ψn(t + ∆t)

V. EXAMPLE

In this section, we perform a simple simulation to verify
the eﬃciency and accuracy of the present method. The
model system we use here is a one-dimensional isolated
system in which two electrons interact by a delta-function
interaction under an oscillating electric ﬁeld. The two-
body wave function Ψ(x1, x2; t) in this system obeys the
following TD-Schr¨odinger equation,

(34)

where α is the coupling constant of the interaction, and
Eo is an external electric ﬁeld to perturb this system.

We suppose that Ψ(x1, x2; t) is expressed by a common

one-electron orbital wave function ψ(x, t) as

Ψ(x1, x2; t) = ψ(x1, t)ψ(x2, t)

We use the following parameters for computation:

External force
ωo = 1/8

First, we compute the lowest eigen state of this system

using the time-independent Kohn-Sham equation:

The peak appearing in energy ωo = 0.125 comes
from the injected light. The peak appearing in energy
ω = 0.261 is expected to be the excitation energy be-
tween the ﬁrst excited state and the ground state.

We have calculated the excitation energy by certain
other methods: Method (A) solves eigen states by the
non-TD-KS equation (37), method (B) modiﬁes the re-
sult of (A) by using RPA, and method (C) diagonalizes
the non-TD-Schr¨odinger equation. The results are listed
below:

We have also tested the simulation using the present
fourth-order non-SCF method (31) and the fourth-order
SCF method proposed in the literature [6]. Figure (3)
shows the errors. Both errors are much less than those
of the second-order methods.

We found the peak obtained by the present method,
i.e., the TD-KS equation, reproduces fairly accurately the
excitation energy calculated by means of the exact diago-
nalization of the non-TD-Schr¨odinger equation. Namely,
by solving the TD-KS equation, dynamical phenomena
can be described more accurately than using the RPA as
far as the eﬀective Hamiltonian is correct.

Next, to evaluate the error of the method, we esti-
mate the error of the density ρ(x, T ) at a speciﬁed time
T = 256[a.u.].

conventional non-SCF method (4), and the conventional

In this test case, the error of the non-SCF method is almost
as same as that of the SCF method.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have proved that simulation of the wave function
under the TD-KS equation can be performed by a simple
scheme and that there is no need for the use of SCF-loops
to maintain the self-consistency of the eﬀective Hamil-
tonian. Our proposed non-SCF method is competitive
in accuracy with the SCF method, and also it is supe-
rior in computational eﬃciency. We are convinced that
our method is helpful for investigating non-adiabatic and
non-linear quantum electrons dynamics.

Errors in the density obtained by three meth-
ods on some small time slices. The conventional non-SCF
method is accurate up to the ﬁrst order of ∆t, while the
present non-SCF method and the conventional SCF method
are accurate up to the second order of ∆t. In this test case,
the error of the non-SCF method is almost as same as that of
the SCF method.

All methods are accurate enough in this result. How-
ever, the conventional non-SCF method is stable only
within a speciﬁc short time span: e.g. T = 512 [a.u.]
for all ∆t in this test. Meanwhile, the present non-
SCF method and the conventional SCF method are sta-
ble even in a long time span: e.g. T = 64M [a.u.],
∆t = 1/16[a.u.]
in this test. Therefore, these methods
are suitable for long time span simulations.

First-principles total-energy calculations of the H/Si(001)-2x1 surfaces reveals a dual diﬀusion
process for the Si adatoms: single along the dimer row while pairing up across the row. The
calculated diﬀusion barrier along the dimer row is 1.1 eV, which is, however, too small to account
for the hydrogen-induced growth disruption seen by experiments. Instead, we ﬁnd that the adatom
diﬀusion, in the presence of H, leads to the formation of immobile fourfold-ring Si tetramers which
are diﬃcult to break. This could explain the adverse eﬀects of H on Si homoepitaxy.

Silicon diﬀusion on Si(001) surface has attracted tremendous interest1,2,3,4,5 due to its importance in silicon
single crystal growth. Hydrogen adsorbed Si(001) surface is the typical starting template for both high temperature
and low temperature growth of silicon devices, latter of which is of particular importance for nanostructure growth6.
A recent experiment7 shows that with one monolayer (ML) coverage of hydrogen the silicon growth disrupts at low
temperature (< 200◦C), which can be resumed at a much higher temperature. This new phenomenon stimulates a great
deal of research interest on the Si mono-hydride surface8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Currently, there are three possible explanations
to this phenomenon. The ﬁrst one7, which is based on the experimental evidence, attributes the interruption of
epitaxy growth to the formation of Si dihydrides on the surface. The second one9, which is based on ﬁrst-principles
calculations, suggests that hydrogen atoms hardly segregate from the surface, hence disrupting the growth. The third
one10,11,14, also based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, suggests that hydrogen can spontaneously segregate from the
surface. However, regarding the growth disruption, the calculations diﬀer considerably: while Refs.11,14 suggest low
barriers implying no disruption, Ref.10 predicts disruption due to large barriers. Growth disruption is also related to
the surface roughness caused by the hydrogen adsorption15, but the explanation to the roughness varies. In the ﬁrst
explanation the roughness is caused by higher-order hydrides, as supported by a ﬁrst-principles calculation16, which
can be overcome at about 200◦C.

In this paper, we perform a ﬁrst-principles total-energy calculation on this problem. We predict that Si adatoms
diﬀuse in two qualitatively diﬀerent ways: as single atoms parallel to the surface dimer row with a 1.1-eV energy
barrier but as pairs perpendicular to the dimer row. The formation of the four-Si tetramers is predicted to occur
during epitaxial growth. Its eﬀects on the homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial growth of Ge on Si are elucidated.

Our calculations are based on the density functional theory(DFT)17 within the local density approximation(LDA)19.
We use a norm-conserving pseudo-potential18 and the plane-wave basis set to perform the molecular dynamics sim-
ulation via the Car-Perrinello scheme20. The surface is modeled by a p(4x4) surface cell consisting of six Si layers
and a nine-layer thick vacuum. The lower surface is passivated by hydrogen. While the bottom two Si + H layers
are ﬁxed, the rest of the atoms are fully relaxed. We used an energy cutoﬀ of 10 Ry with one special k-point for the
supercell Brillouin zone integration. Increasing the cutoﬀ to 12 Ry or adding sampling k points only change the total
energy by less than 0.1 eV/atom, while the change in the energy diﬀerence between conﬁgurations is less than 0.01
eV/atom.

I. SINGLE ADATOM ADSORPTION AND DIFFUSION

. In our calculation, we mimic actual growth process by placing a Si adatom above the H/Si(100) surface and then
let it move. We ﬁnd that the adatom slowly goes to one of the two lowest energy sites shown in FIG. 1(a) and (d).
In qualitative agreement with the previous calculations by Nara et al.10, Jeong and Oshiyama11, and Lee et al.14, the
capture of H by the Si adatom from the hydrogenated surface is spontaneous. However, diﬀerent from their studies,
we ﬁnd that in both cases, the Si adatom causes spontaneously segregation of, not one, but two hydrogen atoms
from the nearby Si-Si dimers to form highly stable Si-H2 complexes with the adatom. This ﬁnding is consistent with
a recent experiment21, in which it was shown that most of the H atoms remain to be on top of the surface during
homoepitaxial growth.

While the atomic structures in FIG. 1(a) and (d) resemble that of Si adatom on the bare1 and on hydrogenated

2

surfaces12, they diﬀer considerably from Refs.10,11,14, in which the Si adatom diﬀusion pathways have been calculated.
In the work of Jeong and Oshiyama11 and Lee et al.14, the Si adatoms assume only high-energy conﬁgurations (as
determined from the present calculations) that involve either one or zero H atom. Not surprisingly, the calculated
diﬀusion barriers are low (0.7 and 1.0 eV, respectively, in Ref.11 for diﬀusions parallel and perpendicular to the surface
dimer row). In contrast, Nara et al.10 considered a diﬀerent diﬀusion pathway involving a two-step process, intra and
inter (1x1) cell hopping where the capture and release process of the hydrogen atoms also plays a key role. It was
concluded that while an H2 capture signiﬁcantly lowers the energy of the Si adatoms, it is advantageous to move the
adatom around within the (1x1) cell with only one H atom. The calculated intra-cell barrier is 0.5 eV. However, only
one of the low-energy conﬁgurations in FIG. 1, i.e., (d), was considered in the calculation. As a result, diﬀusion out of
the (1x1) cell (inter-cell hopping) is diﬃcult. Nara et al. suggested10 that to diﬀuse across cells, the Si adatom must
temporarily loss both of the H atoms to become bare silicon. This unfavorable conﬁguration leads to, on top of the
0.5-eV intra-cell barrier, the unphysical large inter-cell barriers of 1.0 and 1.2 eV, respectively, for diﬀusions parallel
and perpendicular to the dimer row.

In the present study, we consider adatom diﬀusion along a path connecting the low-energy H2-capture conﬁgurations
shown in FIG. 1(a) to (d). The edge-Si adatom in FIG. 1(a) is the ground state conﬁguration. Interestingly, because
this structure has a mirror symmetry in the (¯110) plane, inter- and intra-cell diﬀusions make no diﬀerence, in contrast
to the ﬁndings of Nara et al.10. FIG. 1(b) shows a transition state where the displaced Si adatom gives back one of the
H atoms to the surface atom, labeled 1. The energy is 0.5-eV higher than the ground state due to the “quasi” twofold
coordination. FIG. 1(c) shows another transition state where the Si adatom recaptures a second H from the surface
atom, labeled 2. The diﬀusing adatom eventually lands on top of the Si-Si dimer in FIG. 1(d), which is only 0.03 eV
higher in energy than the ground state. The Si adatom can diﬀuse further up along the dimer row in a reversed order
of (d) to (a), and so on. The calculated upper bound for the diﬀusion barrier is 0.7 eV.

With the 0.7-eV barrier, a growth temperature of 400K, and with the typical vibration frequency for the surface
5, we estimate that the diﬀusion event happens at a frequency of 2 × 104Hz. The Si adatom is ready
atoms of 1013Hz
to diﬀuse along the dimer row. On the other hand, diﬀusion perpendicular to the dimer row is much more diﬃcult.
There are two reasons for this: (i) diﬀusion across the dimer rows requires the adatom to give back both H atoms,
which is energetically costly, and (ii) in the middle of the trough, the adatom is to a large extent unbonded.

II. FORMATION OF THE ADATOM CLUSTERS

. The above discussion shows that Si adatom diﬀusion rate is not the reason for the disruption of silicon homoepitaxy
growth with 1ML H coverage7. Instead, Si adatoms should readily diﬀuse, at least parallel to the dimer row. This
leads to the possibility of adatom clustering, which will be considered next.

FIG. 2 shows the calculated low-energy Si-adatom pairs along with their energies. Throughout the paper, the energy
of the edge-Si adatom in FIG. 1(a) is taken as the energy zero. Given the negative energies in FIG. 2, it is clear
that the formation of the pairs is energetically favored. The atop-dimer in FIG. 2(a) is typical of the surface dimers,
whereas the edge-dimer and in-trough dimer in FIG. 2 (b) and (c) are not, although they have lower or comparable
total energy. A closer examination of the latter reveals that in both cases the Si ad-dimer is engaged in a planar sp2
conﬁguration with nearly 120◦ bond angles, not seen on bare silicon4,5,22,23.

Recently, it has been suggested that adatoms may diﬀuse in pairs with a rate comparable to or even faster than
individual adatoms4,5. Here, we study such a possibility. Consider the edge-dimer conﬁguration in FIG. 2(b): In
order to become the in-trough dimer in FIG. 2(c), it is required to go through an intermediate step as shown in
FIG. 2(d). Note that the ad-dimer diﬀusion parallel to the dimer row is simply a repeat of the pattern in FIG. 2, i.e.,
(b)→(d)→(c)→(d)→(b), · · · etc. The corresponding energy barrier is 1.2 eV. It is also interesting to note that while
diﬀusion perpendicular to the dimer row is diﬃcult for single adatoms, it could be much easier for ad-dimers, which
could be treated separately as (i) diﬀusion across the dimer row and (ii) diﬀusion across the trough. Process (i) can
be realized via the intermediate step in FIG. 2(a), which requires only the rotation of the ad-dimer with respect to
the surface atoms and a transfer of the H atoms. Process (ii) is no diﬀerent from diﬀusion parallel to the dimer row,
with the resulting edge-dimer, however, on the other side of the trough. The corresponding diﬀusion barrier is 1.2 eV.
Speaking of clusters, it is also important to consider the 4-adatom clusters or the tetramers. FIG. 3 shows four
such conﬁgurations made of the ad-dimer pairs. These clusters can be classiﬁed into three diﬀerent categories: (i)
ad-dimer pairs with direct bonding such as those in FIG. 3(a) and (b), (ii) ad-dimer pairs in close association but
without any direct bonding such as the one in FIG. 3(c), and (iii) ad-dimer pairs distant apart. All the tetramers
here have energies considerably lower than either the adatom or ad-dimer, for example, by as much as 1.09 eV per
adatom.

In case (i), the adatoms form fourfold-ring square structures with 90◦ bond angles. With respect to the surface
atoms, the trough-tetramer in FIG. 3(a) forms ﬁve- [along the (¯110) direction] and seven-fold [along (110)] rings,

3

respectively. On the other hand, the atop-tetramer in FIG. 3(b) forms ﬁve- [along (¯110)] and four-fold [along (110)]
rings, respectively. Naturally, the latter (-0.8 eV/atom) have signiﬁcantly higher energy than the former (-1.02
eV/atom). In case (ii), the two ad-dimers form a second nearest neighbor (NN) pair as shown in FIG. 3(c). These
are dimers similar to those on the substrate, except being one layer higher and rotated by 90◦. The NN-tetramers
have the lowest energy because they involve only the ﬁve- [along (¯110)] and six-fold [along (110)] rings. The energy
is not much lower than the trough-tetramers (only by 0.07 eV per Si), however, because of the strain, which can be
easily seen by the large adatom displacements with respect to the surface atoms in FIG. 3(c). In case (iii), two distant
ad-dimers are bound with an energy, -0.83 eV per Si through ﬂipping surface dimers in between. FIG. 3(d) shows the
distant tetramers with the smallest ad-dimer separation possible.

According to their eﬀects on the homoepitaxial growth, we can also classify the tetramers in terms of being a
growth mode or growth-interruption mode. By this deﬁnition, the NN- and the distant tetramers belong to the
growth mode because they are consistent with the further growth of the adatom clusters into a new surface layer
indistinguishable from the substrate. The trough-tetramers, on the other hand, belong to the growth-interruption
mode, as here two ad-dimers are packed into a region with twice of the normal adatom density. To resume the growth
from the growth-interruption mode, either one has to break up the trough-tetramers, which will cost energy, or the
growth front will become defective. Recently, it has been shown24 that the smallest stable adatom islands in the CVD
growth (in which H is involved) consist of two dimers or a tetramer. FIG. 4 compares the calculated STM image for
the trough-tetramer with experiment where adatom clusters are created by applying electrical pulse through STM tip
coated with silicon. The relative stability of the clusters, the size and the relative position of the images with respect
to the substrate suggests that the trough-tetramer model could explain the experiment.

Finally, although the NN-tetramer has a slightly lower energy than the trough-tetramer (by 0.07 eV/atom), kinet-
ically, the trough-tetramers are more readily to form because the diﬀusing adatoms and ad-dimers are mostly in the
forms of edge-atoms and edge-dimers, respectively. Hence, the trough-tetramers have a much higher probability to
form than the NN-tetramers whose formation is an activated process in order to move the adatoms/ad-dimers from
the trough region to atop the dimer row. This kinetic enhancement, together with the diﬃculty to break up the
fourfold rings, provides an alternative explanation to the growth disruption by H.

Because part of the surface dimers in the growth mode, either the NN-tetramer in FIG. 3(c) or the distant tetramer
in FIG. 3(d), is strained, replacing the Si adatoms by Ge adatoms, or replacing some of the surface Si atoms by
Ge as suggested by a recent study25, could lower the strain energy because Ge is larger and prefers longer bonds.
Hence, one can expect that the NN- and distant tetramers to be stabilized with respect to the trough-tetramers during
heteroepitaxy on Si substrates. In other words, while hydrogenation leads to the interruption of the homoepitaxy, a
similar eﬀect could be absent in the heteroepitaxy of germanium. Indeed, it is known26 that the presence of hydrogen
assists the epitaxial growth of Ge on Si, against the formation of islands.

III. SUMMARY

In summary, we have studied the Si adatom diﬀusion processes on the H/Si(100)(2x1) surface by ﬁrst-principles
total-energy calculations. Our results show that Si adatom diﬀusion along the dimer row proceeds with an energy
barrier signiﬁcantly lower than what is required for growth disruption, whereas diﬀusion perpendicular to the dimer
row involves the motion of adatom pairs. Study of the adatom tetramers reveals that the formation of the growth-
interruption trough-tetramers could be the reason for the hydrogen induced disruption of homoepitaxial growth of
silicon.

Abstract

A rational expansion of the Fermi density operator is proposed. This
approach allows to calculate eﬃciently physical properties of fermionic
systems at ﬁnite temperatures without solving an eigenvalue problem.
Using N evaluations of the Green’s function, the Fermi density operator
can be approximated, subject to a given precision, in the energy interval
[−β, ∞] with β ∝ N . The presented method may become especially useful
for electronic structure calculations involving the calculation of charge
densities, but may also ﬁnd other applications in e.g. signal processing
and numerical linear algebra.

1 INTRODUCTION

Quantum systems are most generally described in terms of their density operator
ρ. Once ρ is known, the expectation values of physical quantities are obtained
as

= Tr(ρA)

A
i
h

where A is the associated operator of the quantity under consideration. For
instance, for the calculation of the charge density, A becomes a projector and
the charge density is simply given by the diagonal elements of ρ in the site
representation. In the following we consider fermionic systems in the grand-
canonical ensemble where

with H, T and µ being the Hamiltonian, the temperature and the chemical
potential respectively, and

ρ(µ, T ) = f (

being the Fermi function. The Fermi function has been studied extensively,
and eﬀective approximation schemes for the case of scalar arguments, e.g. the
Sommerfeld expansion, have been developed [1].
However, for the calculation of e.g. ρ, one is faced with f applied to operators.
For large scale applications, it cannot be be switched into the eigen represen-
tation of H in order to evaluate Eq. 2, since in general full diagonalization of
H is practically impossible. Because only polynomial and fractional functions
of operators can be evaluated, corresponding decompositions of f (x) are highly
desirable. A recent approach is due to Goedecker [2] who proposed to use sys-
tematically complex line integrals over the Green’s function. In the following a
fractional expansion is presented which does not depend on the calculation of
line integrals. It will be shown that physical quantities like the charge density,
which is at the base of many methods in electronic structure calculations, can
be obtained eﬀectively without solving an eigenvalue problem, necessitating only
evaluations of the Green’s function at selected points. While the method is a
priory constructed for ﬁnite temperatures, it is also well adapted to approximate
charge densities at zero temperature since the range of the approximation can
be arbitrarily extended towards lower temperatures.

2 The fractional expansion

It is well known, that the Matsubara expansion of the Fermi function,

f (x) = 1/2

shows very poor convergence properties when truncated to degree m = N .
Although being the exact fractional series of f (x), the Matsubara expansion is
therefore not suited for numerical applications.
Let us consider the function

fα(x) := f (x

α)f (

x

α) =

eα

,

which is depicted in Fig. 1 for α = 20. It is readily seen that for suﬃciently
α subject to a given
high α > 0, fα(x + α) will approximate f (x) for all x >
−
precision. We now truncate the series in the denominator,

where

fα(x)

gN (x; α) :=

pN (x; α) = cosh (α) +

It is readily seen than pN (x; α) has no real zeros. For the fractional expansion
of Eq. 6, we need all zeros zν, ν = 1, . . . , N of q(z) := pN (x; α)
|x2=z (see [4]).
For this purpose we deﬁne

y1 = 1 + cosh(α); yi(z) =

One easily shows that the zν are given by the eigenvalues of the matrix A. It
is well known that the zeros of a given polynomial can be obtained from an
eigenvalue problem for a related Hessenberg matrix. Goedecker[3] already has
proposed to use this fact for the numerical evaluation of all zeros of a polynomial
as eigenvalues. The usual scheme corresponds to the implicit choice of yi = zi−1;
here the point is to avoid the explicit use of any factorial by using Eq. 8 leading
to Eq. 9. The zν can be obtained as eigenvalues with e.g. QR-rotations in a
numerically stable way; using standard numerical libraries, N = 40 still yields
accurate results, and enhanced precision calculations readily allow for larger N .

However, N = 30 will be already suﬃcient for many applications as will be
shown. In the following we stick to even N . For convenience, we also chose N
and α so that no duplicate zeros zν are obtained. From the zeros we obtain the
√zν. The zeros zν;α do behave well, an example
2N -zeros xν of pN (x; α) as
is plotted in Fig. 2(i). An important although trivial remark must be made
on the evaluation of polynomials such as q(z) and q′(z), which is to be done
numerically using a Horner-like scheme in order to avoid any explicit use of the
factorial for the reason of limited numerical precision, as e.g. 40! already is a
number with 39 decimal digits. Denoting

As shown in Fig. 2(ii), the coeﬃcients γν also behave well. The approximation
Eq. 10 converges rapidly. Choosing e.g. N = 32 and α = 26, the error in
approximating fα(x) is less than 10−9 for all real x. We have considered the
symmetric function fα, since we may now exploit the local symmetry of fα(x)
about the points x =
α where fα(x) = 0.5. We can approximate successively
the Fermi function as sum of shifted functions gN (x; α),

Eq. 11 vanishes like x−2N compared to exponential decay of the Fermi function,
resulting naturally in a good approximation. For negative x, the validity range
of the approximation Eq. 11 may be increased by choosing a higher M , i.e., by
successively adding shifted realizations of gN (x + (2m

When applied to operators H, the eﬀect of the approximation Eq. 12 is to cut
oﬀ the contributions of states with eigenvalues smaller than ǫl = µ
1)α
(see also Fig. 3). This has no consequences if the spectrum of H is lower bounded
with no eigenvalues in this domain. There are certainly applications when this
eﬀect is wanted, e. g. when considering the contributions of sub-bands separately.
In the example of Fig. 3, M = 3 may be too small for applications involving
real metals, since the eigenvalue spectrum is covered down to -3.5 eV only at
room temperature, and a higher M may be needed. However, M = 3 and N =
32 already is well adapted for e.g. two-dimensional electron gases in mesoscopic
systems. Assuming an Fermi level of about 15 meV, the Fermi density operator
can be approximated quite exactly at temperatures down to 1.5 Kelvin.

This Hamiltonian describes free spinless electrons in a discrete two dimensional

ditions have been assumed for a system with Ns = 15
15 sites, allowing
conveniently for direct diagonalization. The chemical potential has been ﬁxed
between the 25th and 26th smallest eigenvalue of H, µ = (λ25 + λ26)/2, i.e., the
system is in contact with a heath bath of constant chemical potential. We are
interested in the total charge density as function of temperature T , especially

We now approximate the Fermi density operator ρ according to Eq. 12.
As noted in the introduction, the charge density is given in this case by the
diagonal elements of ρ. The results presented in Fig. 4 have been obtained
using 2M N = 192 evaluations of the Green’s function, thus necessitating the
solution of linear systems of equations only. It is seen that the charge density is
indeed very well approximated in the domain where Eq. 11 approximates Eq. 3
as discussed previously. The total charge density at zero temperature (which is,
of course, given by the number of states with energy smaller than the chemical
potential, i.e., 25 in the present example), is practically identical to the total
charge density at low temperatures.

4 CONCLUSIONS

A fractional approximation of the Fermi density operator has been proposed
and the necessary concepts have been presented. This method becomes increas-
ingly appropriate for higher temperatures where the numerical eﬀort decreases.
However, its range of convergence can be arbitrarily extended towards lower
temperatures. It is expected to be useful especially for large scale calculations
at ﬁnite temperatures as e.g. investigations of disordered systems, mesoscopic
systems and electronic structure calculations in general.

We present a method to project a hypercube of arbitrary dimension on the plane, in such a way
as to preserve, as well as possible, the distribution of distances between vertices. The method relies
on a Montecarlo optimization procedure that minimizes the squared diﬀerence between distances in
the plane and in the hypercube, appropriately weighted. The plane projections provide a convenient
way of visualization for dynamical processes taking place on the hypercube.

Dynamical models where the state of a system is repre-
sented by an ordered array of binary variables are ubiq-
uitous in statistical physics, especially in its interdisci-
plinary applications. Perhaps the widest class of mod-
els that admit such Boolean-like representation is consti-
tuted by binary cellular automata [1, 2]. Speciﬁc ap-
plications include biological evolution at the levels of
molecules [3], cells [4], individuals [5] and species [6, 7], as
well as social and socioeconomical behavior [8, 9]. More-
over, genetic algorithms are typically applied to systems
whose conﬁguration is described by means of binary se-
quences [10]. These models may involve large popula-
tions of interacting agents, each of them described as a
time-dependent array of bits, which requires assigning an
evolving density to each possible binary sequence.

While the conﬁguration space of a binary sequence of
length L is naturally represented as the set of 2L vertices
of an L-dimensional hypercube, its visualization can be
dissapointingly diﬃcult, even for L not very large. On
the other hand, besides a quantitative characterization
of the system dynamics through its collective properties,
it is sometimes desirable to rely on a geometrical depic-
tion where the dynamics can be followed, for instance,
on the computer screen. The purpose of this paper is to
present a method to project the vertices of a hypercube
of arbitrary dimension onto a set of points in the plane,
with the condition of preserving, as much as possible, the
structure of the distance distribution on the hypercube.
The motivation of this condition is that many dynami-
cal processes depend on the Hamming distance—i.e., the
number of diﬀerent bits—between binary sequences, and
we require this feature to be well represented by the Eu-
clidean distance between the corresponding points in the
plane projection.

Let hij be the Hamming distance between vertices i
and j in the hypercube, and dij the Euclidean distance
between points i and j in their plane projection. We

that characterizes how diﬀerent are the distances between
pairs of vertices and their projections. Our goal is to ﬁnd
a plane distribution that minimizes E, thus optimizing
the plane representation of the hypercube with respect
to the distance between pairs. We have implemented a
Montecarlo method to approach stochastically the op-
timal solution—the conﬁguration of minimum “energy”
E. Starting from a random initial conﬁguration on the
plane, each point performs a walk with ﬁxed step length r
and directions chosen at random with uniform probabil-
ity in [0, 2π). Each step of this walk produces a change in
the conﬁguration and, hence, in the distances dij , which
implies a variation ∆E in the energy. The new conﬁgu-
ration is accepted with probability

p =

and rejected with probability 1−p. The “temperature” T
parametrizes this probability and allows the usual imple-
mentation of a simulated annealing, where the procedure
starts with a high temperature that enables the system
to explore a wide range in conﬁguration space. Progres-
sively, the temperature is reduced and the system freezes
in one of the many local minima of the energy, typically
not far away from the global minimum if the annealing
is made slowly enough.

We have carried out the described procedure both
interactively, reducing by hand the temperature while
monitoring the conﬁguration of the system on the com-
puter screen, and automatically, by implementing a pro-
grammed reduction of the temperature. Our experiments
show that essentially the same state is achieved in almost
all the realizations. This implies that the energy land-
scape, while rugged, does not posses deep local minima
that could capture the conﬁguration far from the opti-
mal one. The typical ﬁnal conﬁguration for L = 10
(N = 1024 points) is shown in Fig. 1(a). The self-
similarity of its structure is remarkable, since no such
property is present in the hypercube. Despite the appeal
that this self-similar projection may have, it turns out

that such projection is not well suited for our purpose.
Vertices that are relatively near in the hypercube result
rather far away in the projection. As an illustration, the
ﬁrst neighbors j (hij = 1) of a given vertex i are shown
in the ﬁgure. It is apparent that the Euclidean distance
of some of them from the reference vertex is comparable
with the size of the system. Moreover, many other ver-
tices which should be farther away from vertex i, are in
fact much closer.

One way to solve this diﬃculty is to modify the deﬁ-
nition of E, such that near neighbors have more weight
than distant neighbors. In fact, the energy (1) overem-
phasizes the eﬀect of large distances. We have imple-
mented the following simple alternative:

E =

dij − hij

The ﬁnal conﬁguration, which we will term “homoge-
neous,” is shown in Fig. 1(b). Neighbor vertices of a
vertex i now result mapped onto points that surround

the point i, which makes this projection much more sat-
isfying. Certainly, however, some vertices result mapped
near the border of the circle, and the arrangement of
their neighbors is slightly diﬀerent than that of vertices
mapped in the middle of the set. We analyze below how
this aﬀects the distribution of distances.

A good characterization of the projections, and a quan-
titative way for comparing them, is the distribution of
distances in each set. In the hypercube the distribution
of distances to a vertex is the same for every vertex, and
in fact is analytically found to be a binomial distribution.
In the two-dimensional projections there is a diﬀerent dis-
tribution for each point of the set. In Fig. 2(a) and (b) we
show normalized distributions of distances for the self-
similar and the homogeneous projections, respectively.
In both ﬁgures, the black circles show the distribution
of the distance to (any) vertex in the hypercube. Even
though the distances form a discrete set, we show lines
connecting the points to ease the reading of the graph.
The other three curves shown in each plot correspond to
the plane projections. The black squares correspond to
an average on all the points in the sets. Triangles show

averages performed on either the 10% of the points that
form the external corona of the projection, or the 10% of
its more central points. For the points of these subsets,
still, all the distances to other points of the whole set are
taken into account in the distributions.

The most immediate observation regarding Fig. 2 is the
diﬀerence between the distributions in the two projec-
tions. The self-similar projection displays rugged distri-
butions that reﬂect the hierarchical geometrical arrange-
ment of the points. In the homogeneous projection, in-
stead, the distributions are smooth, as in the hypercube.
To this extent, the homogeneous projection can be said
to represent more accurately the distribution of distances
present in the hypercube. The distribution averaged over
the whole set appears, however, skewed towards smaller
distances, with a maximum around d = 3, instead of the
most represented distance h = 5 of the hypercube. In-
terestingly, Fig. 2(b) shows that the outer 10% points
considerably correct this skew. In other words, a point
near the border of the circular array of the projection has
a distribution of distances to the other points in the set
which is rather similar to the distribution of a vertex of
the hypercube.

An appraisal of the plane projections of the hypercube
in a dynamical context results from the consideration of a
diﬀusion process. Let us suppose that, at each time step,
a random walker jumps from a vertex of the hypercube
to one its neighbors with equal probability. The average
distance D from the initial site, as a function of time,
is shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) as black circles. The inset
in both ﬁgures displays the same curve in double loga-
rithmic scales, showing an initial behavior of the form
D(t) ∼ t1/2, like in a regular random walk in Euclidean
space, followed by a saturation as the hypecube space is
fully explored. The average distance as measured on the
plane is shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b) for the self-similar
and the homogeneous projections respectively. As ex-
pected from the distance distribution discussed above,
the results for the plane projections depend on whether
the initial point of the walker is at the border or at the
center of the set. These two cases are shown in Figs. 3(a)
and (b) as triangles pointing upward and downward, re-
spectively. From this dynamical point of view, interior
points behave equally bad in both projections. The most
faithful representation of the process in a plane projection
is the one given by one of the border points of the homo-
geneous set (Fig. 3(b), up triangles). Diﬀusion starting
at these points behaves similarly as from points of the hy-
percube, both in the short and in the long time regimes,
as seen in the linear and the logarithmic plots.

Our main goal of obtaining a sensible plane projec-
tion of the hypercube with the purpose of visualizing a
dynamical process has been achieved, to an acceptable

extent, by the homogeneous projection. Suppose that
a dynamical phenomenon is taking place in a neighbor-
hood of vertex P of a hypercubical phase space. We need
to build a homogeneous projection that maps vertex P
to a point at the border of the plane set. This is easily

done by generating a projection at random and identify-
ing one of the points at the border ﬁrst. Suppose that one
such point is Q. Then, each vertex I of the hypercube is
mapped to a point in the plane projection as

I → (I ⊕ P ) ⊕ Q,

where ⊕ stands for the bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) oper-
ator. The projection obtained in this way provides a nice
plane visualization substrate for the process.

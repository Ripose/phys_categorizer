Abstract

We present an energy conserving leap-frog ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme for the nonlinear Maxwell’s
equations investigated by Hile and Kath [C.V.Hile and W.L.Kath, J.Opt.Soc.Am.B 13, 1135
(1996)]. The model describes one-dimensional scalar optical soliton propagation in polarization
preserving nonlinear dispersive media. The existence of a discrete analog of the underlying
continuous energy conservation law plays a central role in the global accuracy of the scheme
and a proof of its generalized nonlinear stability using energy methods is given. Numerical
simulations of initial fundamental, second and third-order hyperbolic secant soliton pulses of
ﬁxed spatial full width at half peak intensity containing as few as 4 and 8 optical carrier
wavelengths, conﬁrm the stability, accuracy and eﬃciency of the algorithm. The eﬀect of a
retarded nonlinear response time of the media modeling Raman scattering is under current
investigation in this context.

1 Introduction

Computational modeling of Maxwell’s equations using ﬁnite-diﬀerence time domain methods
has been shown simple in concepts and execution, allowing accurate predictions for a wide
range of optical phenomena [1], in particular for optical soliton propagation [2]. One of the
fundamental advantages in solving directly the nonlinear Maxwell’s equations instead of scalar
generalized nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations for the slowly varying envelope of the optical pulses
is that scattering, diﬀraction and short pulse eﬀects are retained in the former approach [3] since
all the electromagnetic components without eliminating the carrier are taken into account.

In this paper we solve numerically Maxwell’s equations describing scalar one-dimensional
optical soliton propagation in nonlinear media of arbitrary dispersion proposed in Ref.[4]. We
implement an eﬃcient leap-frog ﬁnite-diﬀerence time domain numerical method. The funda-
mental diﬀerence with the leap-frog method used in Ref.[4] is that our scheme has a discrete
analog of the underlying continuous energy conservation law, which lies at the basis of its global
accuracy and stability. We give an explicit proof of its generalized nonlinear stability using
known results on energy methods [5, 6, 7].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the model and derive the exact
energy conservation law. Section 3 deals with the conservative ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme and its
main properties. The discerete energy conservation law is established and generalized stability
is analyzed in Section 4. Finally, we give numerical results in Section 5 for the propagation
of fundamental, second and third-order hyperbolic secant solitons of ﬁxed full width at half
peak intensity (FWHM) containing as few as 4 and 8 optical carrier wavelengths. Appendix
A is devoted to a short linear stability analysis and Appendix B to the numerical dispersion
relation. We show how the speed of a moving coordinate system can be adjusted in order
to reduce the numerical phase velocity error of the pulse to one part in 105, which is small
compared to the physical dispersion being modeled.

2 The Model System

Propagation of light in nonlinear dispersive optical media is governed by Maxwell’s equations
expressed in terms of E and H, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds respectively, (considered as
primary ﬁeld quantities) and D and B, the derived electric and magnetic ﬂux densities,

We choose the constitutive relations (depending on the nature of the media considered) of the
form

where µ0 and ǫ0 are the free-space permeability and permittivity, and Φ, ΦN L are the induced
linear and nonlinear electric polarizations, which are related to the electric ﬁeld through the
following relation :

plify Maxwell’s equations by considering isotropic and homogeneous media, allowing a one-
dimensional (chosen to coincide with the x-direction), mono-mode, polarization preserving for-
mulation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld propagation problem, appropriate to waveguide struc-
tures. The time delay of the nonlinear response function χ(3) will be investigated in a sep-
arate publication and is ignored in the present analysis. We assume here that time depen-
dence of the nonlinear susceptibility factorizes in a product of three delta-Dirac distributions
χ(3)(t1, t2, t3) = aδ(t1)δ(t2)δ(t3). We choose for simplicity the case of circularly polarized ﬁelds
E = (0, Ey, Ez)T , H = (0, Hy, Hz)T with

Ey(x, t) = (1/2) q(x, t) exp[i(k0x
Ez(x, t) = (1/2) q(x, t) exp[i(k0x

Note that if Φ and ΦN L are both zero (vacuum), the particular choice of rotated ﬁelds (5) sim-
plify Maxwell’s equations to µ0Ht = Ex , ǫ0Et = Hx , which are invariant under the substitution
E′ = Kµ0H , H ′ = Kǫ0E (duality property).

To describe chromatic dispersion [3] (accounted for by the linear polarization Φ) we adopt

the usual Lorentz model for the refractive index, namely we take χ(1)(t) of the form

χ(1)(t) =

γ2, ω1 and β1 are resp. the frequency and strength of the atomic resonance,
where ν0 ≡

refractive index is then written as

We choose the initial electric ﬁeld of the form

where x0 = ct0 is the characteristic length scale of the initial hyperbolic secant pulse proﬁle
of peak amplitude E0, and is related to the full width at half peak intensity (FWHM) by
Λ = 1.76 x0. We express for convenience all ﬁelds in a dimensionless form as follows

3 The Numerical Scheme

We will now introduce a ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation deﬁned on a discrete time and space
mesh for the system of partial diﬀerential equations (23) deﬁned in the continuum. The im-
portant property, which we will be concerned in the derivation of the scheme is that it should
reproduce discrete analogs of the continuous conserved quantities. The existence of discrete
conservation laws is important for the global accuracy of the scheme [11, 12] and will be at the
basis of the generalized stability analysis. From now on, for simplicity we drop the tilda symbol
over all ﬁelds and variables, bearing in mind their dimensionless form and denote the mesh sizes
by χ = ∆ˆx, τ = ∆ˆt. We start by introducing the following centered diﬀerence derivatives

The relevant features to be checked for the choice of the particular diﬀerence scheme are
(1) its consistency, (2) the existence of a discrete conserved energy, (3) its stability and (4)
convergence. Formally, the requirement of consistency, i.e. in the limit of small time and space
steps, the diﬀerence system becomes identical to the diﬀerential one, can be checked using the
Taylor expansions (30) yielding

diﬀerence scheme (31).

4 Nonlinear Stability and Convergence

To address and analyze the problem of stability and convergence, we need a measure of the
diﬀerence between two “states” of the physical system modeled [13]. Obviously, this measure

should have the properties of a norm. In the present case, we introduce the discrete L2-norm
deﬁned by

expresses the generalized stability of the numerical scheme (31) in the sense studied by Guo
Ben-Yu [6].

We now consider the convergence of the scheme. We denote by H, E, Φ and U continuous,
diﬀerentiable functions solution of the diﬀerential system (23), and by H n(x), En(x), Φn(x),
U n(x), the numerical solution of the diﬀerence system (31). For a discussion of convergence, we
need a measure of the diﬀerence between the exact and the computed solution. We denote this
n
(x), en(x), ϕn(x), un(x) for x belonging to the discrete lattice Qχ. The discussion
error by h
then follows the same spirit as for the stability. The numerical errors satisfy formally a set of
equations like (40)-(43). Applying the results of Theorem 1, we obtain an equivalent inequality
for the numerical errors, expressed by the following Theorem :

5 Numerical Results

In this section we present results of the numerical simulations performed to test the stability
and global accurary of the conservative ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme (31). For clarity we rewrite
the tilda symbols over all ﬁelds and variables to recall their dimensionless form. We have a
completely explicit 3-level, 5-points scheme with four unknows ˜H n+1
at each

j

, ˜U n+1

, ˜En+1

time level n + 1. The scheme is therefore not self-starting and a boot-strapping method is used
to compute the ﬁelds at the ﬁrst time level n = 1 from the intial data at n = 0. Speciﬁcally, the
boot-strapping technique ﬁrst advances the numerical solution from ˆt = 0 to ˆt = τ /8 using the
diﬀerence equations (31) with ﬁeld values such as ˜En−1
j+1)/2
etc. Our scheme is then used to advance the solution successively from ˆt = τ /8 to τ /4 , τ /2 , τ .
Approximate initial conditions ˜Z(ˆx, ˆt = 0) can be obtained using the Fourier transform solution
of the linear part of the diﬀerential system (23). Choosing the initial electric ﬁeld of the form
(20) with ˜q(ˆx) = η1sech(ˆx) and assuming that the Fourier amplitudes

for n = 0 replaced by ( ˜E0

(59)

The boundary conditions implemented to solve the diﬀerence system (31) are absorbing
boundary conditions minimizing reﬂections at the end points of the mesh. Since we are interested
in solitonlike solutions, the presence of linear dispersive radiation is expected to be small and
we can therefore use simple linear dispersionless boundary conditions obtained by setting ˜a, ˜Φ
and ˜U equal to zero in the diﬀerential equations (23). Allowing only for outgoing waves at the
boundaries corresponds to prescribe ˜E =
˜H at the right-hand boundary and ˜E = ˜H at the
left-hand boundary.

We take the value of the initial hyperbolic secant pulse characteristic time constant t0 equal
to 14.6 10−15s, (x0 = 4.38 µm), the medium resonance frequency and strength ˜ω1 = 6 , β1 = 3,
as in the work of Hile and Kath [4], and use a small value of damping rate ˜γ = 10−9. We are
currently investigating a new conservative ﬁnite-diﬀerence time domain scheme to model the
ﬁnite response time of the nonlinear susceptibility χ(3) (the Raman eﬀect) in (3), which be-
comes important for optical femtosecond pulses. The advantage of modeling directly Maxwell’s
equations instead of nonlinear Schr¨odinger type equations for slowly varying envelopes is that
in the present approach the modeling of the optical carrier exp(i˜k0 ˆx) is retained. We choose
the carrier wavelength ˜λ0 = 2π/˜k0 equal to (1/4)˜Λ and (1/8)˜Λ where ˜Λ (FWHM) is equal
to 1.76. The corresponding values of frequency, group velocity and group velocity dispersion
are obtained from the linear dispersion relation (22). The appropriate value for the nonlinear
parameter ˜a is found from (19). Finally, by choosing a uniform spatial resolution of 100 steps
per carrier wavelenth, χ = ˜λ0/100 = 44 10−4, [˜λ0 = (1/4)˜Λ] and adjusting the value of α to the
group velocity ω′ plus a small correction (a temporal resolution τ = (1/2)χ obtained from (A3)
is suitable), we can reduce the numerical phase velocity error to 10−5 as shown in Appendix B.
(1) we present the electric ﬁeld proﬁles at the initial time, after half and two
soliton periods, for the case of a ﬁxed initial pulse width (FWHM equals to Λ = 1.76 x0 =
7.71µm containing 8 and 4 optical carrier wavelengths. For the 8 cycle case (˜λ0 = ˜Λ/8), soliton
parameters are given by ˜ω0 = 30.46, ˜ω′ = 0.93, ˜ω′′ = 0.0047, ˜a = 0.0003, ˜TS
336, while for
the 4 cycle case (˜λ0 = ˜Λ/4) , they are ˜ω0 = 18, ˜ω′ = 0.76, ˜ω′′ = 0.028, ˜a = 0.0032, ˜TS
57. It is
clear from these plots that the solitons are stable pulse solutions for a wide range of parameter
values. In both cases, the appearance of an asymmetry in the leading edge of the pulse as a

consequence of the higher-order dispersion is noticeable. The results in Fig. (2) display the
maximum electric ﬁeld magnitude for initial 3-, 2- and fundamental soliton pulses. We observe
an interesting wavelength-dependent eﬀect, namely the shift of the amplitude peak to later
times for larger wavelengths ( look at the dashed lines corresponding to the 4 cycle pulse). We
provide the energy plots in Fig. (3). As in the previous ﬁgure, a temporal oscillatory pattern
for higher-order solitons is observable. The tiny oscillations of the energy, appear presumably
as a result of the nonsoliton part of the initial pulses. Finally, the numerical phase velocity
error as given by (B4) is computed in Fig. (4). The cross on both graphs indicates the value
of the numerical phase error at the group velocity α = ˜ω′. Simulations have been carried out
with α chosen to reduce the error to 10−5.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we have presented numerical results for Maxwell’s equations describing soliton
propagation in nonlinear dispersive media reported in [4]. We proposed a particular conservative
ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme to solve the coupled diﬀerential equations based on the existence of a
discrete conservation law corresponding to the underlying continuous energy conservation law.
We proved that this property provides the stability and global accuracy of the algorithm. In
the numerical simulations, initial hyperbolic secant pulse shapes of ﬁxed full width at half peak
intensity Λ = 7.71µm , containing as few as 4 and 8 optical carrier wavelenthgs were considered.
We computed the temporal evolution of the pulse proﬁle, the maximum ﬁeld amplitude, and
the energy for initial fundamental, second and third-order solitons. Further extension of this
method to the case of a ﬁnite response time of the nonlinearity is under current investigation.

We expect this upper mesh size ratio to be valid also for the nonlinear conservative scheme if the
nonlinearity is suﬃciently weak (i.e. for suﬃciently small optical carrier wavelengths). Finally,
note that if Φ is equal to zero, the ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme is consistent with the underlying
continuous duality property of Maxwell’s equations.

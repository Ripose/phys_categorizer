We propose here a new model of encryption of binary data taking advantage of the complexity
associated with delayed dynamics. In this scheme, the encryption process is a coupling dynamics
with various time delays between diﬀerent bits in the original data. It is shown that decoding of
the encrypted data is extremely diﬃcult without a complete knowledge of coupling manner with
associated delays for all bits of the data.

Complex behaviors due to time delays are found in many natural and artiﬁcial systems. Some examples are delays
in bio-physiological controls (1, 2), and signal transmission delays in large–scale networked or distributed information
(3, 4)). Research on systems or models with delay has also been carried out in the ﬁelds of
systems (See e.g.
mathematics(5, 6), artiﬁcial neural networks (7, 8), and in physics (9, 10, 11). This series of research has revealed
that time delay can introduce surprisingly complex behaviors to otherwise simple systems, because of which delay has
been considered an obstacle from the point of view of information processing.

In this paper, however, we actually take advantage of this complexity with delayed dynamics and incorporate it
into a new model of encryption. The encryption process is identiﬁed with a coupling dynamics with various time
delays between diﬀerent bits in the original data. We show that the model produces a complex behavior with the
characteristics needed for an encryption scheme.

Let us now describe the encryption model in more detail. S(0) is the original data of N binary bits, whose ith
element si(0) takes values +1 or −1. The delayed dynamics for the encryption can be speciﬁed by a key which consists
of the following three parts: (1) a permutation P generated from (1, 2, 3, .., N ), (2) a delay parameter vector ~τ which
consists of N positive integers, and (3) number of iterations of the dynamics T . Given the key K = (P, ~τ , T ), the
dynamics is deﬁned as

si(t) = (−1) × spi(t − τi),
(1)
where pi and τi are ith element of P and ~τ , respectively. (If t − τi < 0, we set t − τi = 0.) In Figure 1, this dynamics is
shown schematically. The state of the ith element of S(t) is given by ﬂipping the state of the pith element of S(t − τi).
Thus this dynamics causes interaction between N bits of the data in both space and time. The encoded state S(T )
is obtained by applying this operation of equation (1) iteratively T times starting from S(0).

We investigate numerically the nature of the delayed dynamics from the perspective of measuring the strength as
an encryption scheme. First, we examine how the state S(t) evolves with time.
In Figure 2 , we have shown an
example of encoded states with diﬀerent T using the same P and ~τ for a case of N = 81. To be more quantitative,
we compute the following quantity as a measure of diﬀerence between two encoded states at diﬀerent times t and tf :

Y (t) =

Si(t)Si (tf )

A typical example is shown in Figure 3. We note that the dynamics of our model has a property of occasionally
very similar, but not exactly the same, states appearing indicated by sharp peaks in the ﬁgure. Except around
these particular points, however, we generally obtain rather uncorrelated encoded states (i.e., Y ≈ 0) with diﬀerent
iteration times. This is a desirable property of the model as an encryption scheme: the same state can be encoded
into uncorrelated states by changing T .

Next, we investigated the eﬀect of a minor change of P and ~τ on the model dynamics. Starting with the same
initial condition, we evaluate how two states S(t) and S′(t) are encoded with slightly diﬀerent P and P′, respectively,

A representative result is shown in Figure 4. The same evaluation with ~τ and ~τ ′ is shown in Figure 5. These graphs
indicate that if we take suﬃciently large T , the same state can evolve into rather uncorrelated states with only a
slight change of P and ~τ . This again is a favorable property in the light of encryption. It makes iterative and gradual

FIG. 5. Example of the correlation X evaluated by equation (3) between two states encoded by slightly diﬀerent ~τ and ~τ ′.

The diﬀerence of ~τ ′ from ~τ is indicated by a box. The initial state and P and ~τ are the same as in Figure 2.

With these properties of the model, an exhaustive search appears to be the only method for guessing the key. Even
if one knows N and τmax, the largest element in ~τ , one is still required to search for the correct key from among
(N !)(τmax)N combinations and to guess T . The commonly used DES (Data Encryption Standard) employs 256 bit
keys (12) . We can obtain a similar order of diﬃculty with rather small values of N and τmax; for instance, N ≈ 11
and τmax ≈ 10 (13).

There are diﬀerent methods possible for using this model for a secure communication between two persons who
share the key. One example is that the sender sends a series of encoded data in sequence for the interval between
T and T + τmax (or longer). The receiver can recover the original data from this set of encoded data by applying a
reverse dynamics with the key. In a situation where the data sent is a choice out of multiple data sets known to the
receiver, the receiver can run the encryption dynamics to the entire sets with the key for case matching.

As in many dynamical systems in the presence of delay, the behavior of the model presented here is not analytically
tractable as it stands. The model can be viewed as an extension of iterative function on a vector, or as an extension
of cellular automata, with diﬀerent delays for each element. Analytical and numerical investigation of the model from
these perspectives as well as implementation of the model into a software tool is currently underway. It is hoped
that the model presented here can serve to call attention to the issue of encryption from the standpoint of delayed
dynamics studies taking place in various scientiﬁc disciplines.

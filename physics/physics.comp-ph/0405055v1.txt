Abstract

We study the Ising model on the triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor couplings Knn, next-

nearest-neighbor couplings Knnn > 0, and a magnetic ﬁeld H. This work is done by means of

ﬁnite-size scaling of numerical results of transfer matrix calculations, and Monte Carlo simulations.

We determine the phase diagram and conﬁrm the character of the critical manifolds. The emphasis

of this work is on the antiferromagnetic case Knn < 0, but we also explore the ferromagnetic regime

Knn ≥
whole range

−∞

0 for H = 0. For Knn < 0 and H = 0 we locate a critical phase presumably covering the

< Knn < 0. For Knn < 0, H

= 0 we locate a plane of phase transitions containing

a line of tricritical three-state Potts transitions. In the limit H

this line leads to a tricritical

model of hard hexagons with an attractive next-nearest-neighbor potential.

INTRODUCTION

The Ising model on the triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor couplings Knn, next-

nearest-neighbor couplings Knnn, and a magnetic ﬁeld H, is deﬁned by the reduced Hamil-

and of next-nearest neighbors, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 1.

This model, in particular the antiferromagnetic model (Knn < 0), displays interesting

behavior. For Knnn = 0, H = 0 the model has been solved exactly [1]. A ferromagnetic

transition occurs at Knn = ln(3)/4. An antiferromagnetic (Knn < 0) mirror image of this

transition is absent. This is related to the fact that the triangular lattice is not bipartite.
However, at zero temperature, i.e., for Knn → −∞
with algebraically decaying correlations [2]. This zero-temperature model can be exactly

, the model displays a critical phase

mapped on a solid-on-solid (SOS) model [3]. Under renormalization, it is assumed to map

on the Gaussian model [4] and on the related Coulomb gas [5]. The coupling constant gR

of the Coulomb gas can thus be obtained exactly as gR = 2 so that a number of critical

exponents can be calculated. The Ising temperature T

nn appears to be relevant: the
critical state is destroyed for all T > 0. Commensurate-incommensurate transitions occur

∝ −

K −

1

when ﬁnite diﬀerences between the inﬁnite nearest-neighbor couplings in the three lattice

directions are introduced [3, 4].

Next we consider the case of H = 0 and Knnn 6

= 0. The mapping on the SOS model

(and we may also assume this for the Coulomb gas) is still valid for Knn → −∞
absence of an exact solution, gR is no longer exactly known. It has, however, been deduced

but, in the

[4] that gR is an increasing function of Knnn. The Coulomb gas analysis predicts that, for

suﬃciently large gR, the Ising temperature becomes irrelevant, so that the algebraic phase

extends to nonzero temperatures. This analysis also predicts that for even larger gR a phase

transition to a ﬂat SOS phase occurs, both at zero and at nonzero temperatures.

Somewhat earlier, part of this scenario had already been described by Landau [6]. Via

the lattice-gas representation of Eq. (1), he used the connection with the XY model in the

presence of a six-state clock-like perturbation, made earlier by Domany et al. [7]. He could

thus make use of their results [7] for this model which allow for the existence of a critical,

2

XY-like phase in a nonzero range Knn > 0. Furthermore, Landau [6] used the Monte Carlo

method to verify the existence and nonuniversal character of this critical phase for the case

of a ﬁxed ratio Knnn/Knn =

1.

−

Another tool to study the model with nonzero next-nearest-neighbor couplings Knnn is

provided by the transfer-matrix technique. A simpliﬁcation has been used in the latter

approach: Knnn was taken to be nonzero only for four out of the six next-nearest neighbors

[8, 9, 10]. This leads to a substantial simpliﬁcation of the transfer matrix calculations,

but the resulting system lacks isotropy, so that applications of conformal mappings become

diﬃcult. On this basis, limited evidence [10] for the existence of the critical phase was

reported; the limitation of this evidence is obviously related to the lack of sixfold symmetry.

Next we consider the consequences of a nonzero ﬁeld H > 0. On the basis of the relation

with the Coulomb gas it has been derived [4] that, for Knn → −∞
magnetic ﬁeld H is irrelevant: the critical state is not destroyed by a suﬃciently small ﬁeld

and Knnn = 0, the

H

= 0. However, the magnetic ﬁeld tends to increase the Coulomb gas coupling constant

gR. The ﬁeld will become marginally relevant at gR = 9/4 and a transition of the Kosterlitz-

Thouless (KT) type or, in this context more appropriate, of the roughening type is thus

expected. This transition separates the critical phase from a long-range ordered phase,

where the majority of the minus-spins have condensed on one of the three sublattices of

the triangular lattice. This prediction has been conﬁrmed [11, 12] by means of numerical

methods. The long-range ordered phase extends to nonzero temperature T > 0 and is

separated from the disordered phase by a line of phase transitions in the (H, T ) plane that

belongs to the three-state Potts universality class [12, 13, 14, 15, 16].

Since the Ising model in a ﬁeld can be mapped on a vertex model, and the critical

manifolds of solvable vertex models are described by the zeroes of simple polynomials in the

vertex weights [17], it may be assumed that also for the triangular lattice the critical line

in the (H, T ) is described by such a polynomial. This assumption was recently refuted by

Qian et al. [12]. The shape of the critical line, as deduced from this assumption, was found

to be inconsistent with the numerical evidence. They also found that the renormalization

ideas originally outlined by Nienhuis et al. [4] could be applied to predict the shape of the

critical line in the (H, T ) plane for small T . This shape was found to be consistent with

their numerical data for the critical line.

The aforementioned three-state Potts-like critical line is naturally part of a critical surface

3

6
extending to nonzero Knnn. The more involved problem to ﬁnd the phase diagram in the

three-parameter (H, Knnn, Knn) space has already been partly explored. On the basis of

renormalization arguments, Nienhuis et al. [4] obtained information about the shape of the

critical surface in the limit H

0. Landau [6] performed Monte Carlo simulations for a

ﬁxed ratio Knnn/Knn =

1. He determined the line of phase transitions as a function of H

and noted that the three-state Potts character along this line changes at a tricritical point

→

−

beyond which the transition turns ﬁrst-order.

In this work we verify the predictions in Ref. 4 and determine the critical values of Knnn

corresponding to several relevant values of the Coulomb gas coupling constant gR, both for

ﬁnite and inﬁnite Knn. We verify the character of the predicted critical phase at H = 0. We

also study the critical phenomena associated with the introduction of a nonzero magnetic
ﬁeld and explore the full three-parameter phase diagram for Knnn ≥

0.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we summarize our numerical methods which

include Monte Carlo algorithhms and the construction of a transfer matrix. We deﬁne the

observables that will be the subject of our numerical analysis. The study of the phase

transitions of the triangular Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor couplings

in a zero ﬁeld is presented in Sec. III, and in Sec. IV we describe our results for a nonzero

magnetic ﬁeld; we conclude with a discussion in Sec. V.

II. NUMERICAL METHODS

A. Transfer-matrix calculations

Most of the the transfer-matrix calculations were performed for T > 0 so that we had to

use a binary representation for the Ising spins, leading to a transfer matrix of size 2L

2L for a

×

system with ﬁnite size L. For T = 0 one can use a simpliﬁed transfer matrix of a smaller size

[11]. We deﬁne the spin lattice on the surface of a cylinder, and take the transfer direction

perpendicular to a set of nearest-neighbor edges. The lattice is divided into three sublattices

denoted as 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. Nearest-neighbor interactions occur

only between diﬀerent sublattices and next-nearest-neighbor interactions occur within the

same sublattice.

To enable calculations for system as large as possible, a sparse matrix decomposition

4

has been used. This leads to a very signiﬁcant reduction of the required computer time

and memory. The transfer matrices are deﬁned in [11, 12] for the nearest-neighbor model.

Here we modify the transfer matrix to include all next-nearest-neighbor interactions. This

makes it necessary to code two (instead of one) layers of spins as the transfer matrix index.

Finite-size calculations with L multiples of 6 up to L = 24 were performed. The maximum

ﬁnite size L = 24 corresponds to a cylinder with a circumference of only 12 nearest-neighbor

bonds.

cylinder is deﬁned as:

The magnetic correlation function along the coordinate r in the length direction of the

gm(r) =

At large r, this correlation function decays exponentially with a characteristic length scale

ξm that depends on Knn, Knnn, H, and L:

which can be calculated from the largest two eigenvalues λ0 and λ1 of the transfer matrix:

gm(r)

e−

∝

r/ξm(Knn,Knnn,H,L)

1

m (Knn, Knnn, H, L) =
ξ−

ln(λ0/λ1),

1
2√3

where the factor 2√3 is a geometric factor for two layers of spins. For the calculation of ξm,

we make use of the symmetry of the eigenvectors associated with λ0 and λ1. The leading

eigenvector (for λ0) is invariant under a spatial inversion. In contrast, the second eigenvector

is antisymmetric under inversion.

The theory of conformal invariance [18] relates ξm on the cylinder with the magnetic

scaling dimension Xm (one half of the magnetic correlation function exponent η). This

exponent may be estimated as

Xm(Knn, Knnn, H, L) =

L
2πξm(Knn, Knnn, H, L)

.

Asymptotically for a critical model with large L we have

where Xm = 1/(2gR) in the language of Coulomb gas. This equation allows us to estimate

Xm numerically and thus to obtain evidence about the universality class of the model. Or, if

the universality class, and thus Xm, are considered known, Eq. (6) and be used to determine

the critical surface, e.g. to solve for Knnn for given values of Knn, H and L. As a consequence

of corrections to scaling, the solution will not precisely coincide with the critical point. The

eﬀects of an irrelevant scaling ﬁeld u and a small deviation t with respect to the critical

value of Knn, or Knnn, or H are expressed by

Xm(Knn, Knnn, H, L) = Xm + auLyi + btLyt +

(7)

· · ·

where a and b are unknown constants, yi is irrelevant exponent and yt is temperature

exponent. For the solution of the equation Xm(Knn, Knnn, H, L) = Xm we thus have

auLyi + btLyt

0, so that we expect corrections proportional to Lyi

estimates. For instance, for three-state Potts universality one has yt = 6/5 and yi =

so that the leading ﬁnite-size dependence of the estimated critical points is as L−

2. This

knowledge is helpful for the extrapolation to the actual L =

critical point.

In addition to ξm, it is possible to determine a second correlation length ξt describing

the exponential decay of the energy-energy correlation function.

It is associated with a

third eigenvalue λ2 of the transfer matrix with an eigenvector that is symmetric under a

spatial inversion, just as the one with eigenvalue λ0. The pertinent eigenvalue is thus solved

by means of orthogonalization with respect to the ﬁrst eigenvector.

In analogy with the

case of the magnetic correlation length we can use the third eigenvalue λ2 to estimate the

temperature-like scaling dimension Xt as

Xt(Knn, Knnn, H, L) =

L
2πξt(Knn, Knnn, H, L)

,

where ξt = 1
2√3

ln(λ0/λ2). At criticality, it behaves for large L as:

Xt(Knn, Knnn, H, L)

Xt.

(9)

Combining Eqs. (6) and (9), we can solve for two unknowns simultaneously, using the known

[5] values of the tricritical three-state Potts model, namely Xm = 2/21 and Xt = 2/7. In

this way, we can estimate the tricritical point (Knnn, Knn) for a given H. The corrections can

be argued to be proportional to Lyi

yt2 where yt2 = 4/7 and yi =

decay as L−

B. Monte Carlo simulations

Since transfer-matrix calculations are, although highly accurate, restricted to small sys-

tems, we have also written Monte Carlo algorithms for the present model. To obtain good

statistical accuracies we included not only a Metropolis algorithm, but also a Wolﬀ and a

geometric cluster algorithm. Which algorithm is used depends on the location in the phase

diagram. The Wolﬀ algorithm is applicable in only the case of zero magnetic ﬁeld. The

geometric algorithm [19] conserves the magnetization and was therefore used in combina-

tion with the Metropolis algorithm. This combination was found to work faster than the

Metropolis method, but the gain in eﬃciency depends on the position in the three-parameter

space.

Several quantities were sampled using these algorithms in order to explore the phase

diagram. First we deﬁne the uniform magnetization as m

in the long-range ordered antiferromagnetic or ‘ﬂat’ phases, and to zero in the disordered

(paramagnetic) phase. From its moments we deﬁne the magnetic Binder ratio as

they converge to a constant as L increases. This property can be used for the determination

of critical points.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR ZERO FIELD

We restrict this work to ferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions (Knnn > 0).

First, we consider the Ising model in a zero ﬁeld (H = 0), and study the phase diagram in

7

(Knnn, Knn) plane. We distinguish the cases Knn > 0 and Knn < 0.

A. Results for the ferromagnetic transition (Knn > 0)

For the Ising model we have Xm = 1/8 so that at criticality we expect that asymptotically

for large L

Xm(Knn, Knnn, 0, L)

≃

(13)

from which one can estimate critical points e.g. by solving for Knnn at a given value of Knn

or vice versa. In certain cases, critical points can be determined accurately by extrapolating

to L =

. For instance, for Knnn = 0 we obtain the critical value of the nearest-neighbor

∞

coupling Knn = 0.2746528(10), which is consistent with the exact result Knn = ln(3)/4. The

results are shown in Fig. 2.

We also checked that, at the decoupling point (Knn = 0) the critical value of the next-

nearest-neighbor coupling Knnn equals the exact value ln(3)/4 . The three sublattices, which

are also triangular lattices, become independent at the decoupling point.

B. Results for the antiferromagnetic region (Knn < 0)

At ﬁnite Knn < 0 and small Knnn > 0, the model is obviously disordered. As described

in the Introduction, with increasing Knnn the model is expected to undergo: 1) a Kosterlitz-

Thouless transition to a critical phase at the point where the Coulomb gas coupling reads

gR = 4, and the corresponding value of the magnetic dimension is Xm = 1/(2gR) = 1/8;

2) a roughening transition to a ﬂat phase, and the corresponding value of the magnetic

dimension is thus Xm = 1/18 at gR = 9. We have solved Knnn from Eq. (6) for these two

values of Xm, at several ﬁxed values of Knn. The results were extrapolated to L =

by

∞

means of three-point ﬁts involving a constant (the estimated value of Knnn) plus a ﬁnite-size

correction involving a free exponent. The ﬁnal estimates are included in the phase diagram

Fig. 2. They suggest that the two boundaries of the critical phase merge at the decoupling

point Knn = 0. Our numerical results include a few special points at zero temperature
(Knn → −∞

). In the renormalization scenario, their meaning is as follows:

1. For gR = 9/4 we obtain Knnn = 0.0185 (4). This is where the line of roughening

transitions in the (Knnn, H) plane meets the Knnn axis.

8

2. For gR = 3 we obtain Knnn = 0.0667 (2). This is where the line of three-state Potts

transitions in the plane perpendicular to the Knnn axis comes in as a straight line with

a nonzero, ﬁnite slope as argued in Ref. 12.

3. For gR = 4 we obtain Knnn = 0.1179 (2). This is where the KT-like line in the

(Knnn, Knn) plane meets the Knnn axis.

4. For gR = 9 we obtain Knnn = 0.226 (2). This is where the line of roughening transitions

in the (Knnn, Knn) plane meets the Knnn axis. This point corresponds with an actual

phase transition on the Knnn axis. We note that, in cases 1 and 3, the Knnn axis

meets with other lines of phase transitions. However, phase transitions do not occur

at points 1 and 3 because the critical amplitudes vanish on the Knnn axis.

C. Shape of the critical lines for small

Knn|
|

On the basis of an argument due to van Leeuwen [20], the scaling behavior of Knn near

the decoupling point (Knnn = ln(3)/4, Knn = 0), is governed by a new critical exponent
Knn|

ya = 7/4. This exponent thus determines the shape of the critical lines for small

|

according to

One can ﬁnd the critical exponent ya exactly from the known properties of the magnetic

correlation function of the critical Ising model. The spin-spin correlation behaves as

2Xm,

where Xm = 1/8 for the 2D Ising model. This also applies to the decoupling point where the

model decomposes in three independent sublattices. This determines the scaling behavior

of a four-spin correlation function involving spins in diﬀerent sublattices in the limit of
Knnn →

where s00 and s01 are nearest-neighbor spins belonging to diﬀerent sublattices, say sublattices

1 and 2. The same applies to the pair (sr0, sr1) at a distance r. Eq. (15) describes the energy-

energy correlation associated with Knn. Its power-law decay is thus expressed by

2Xa,

∝

where Xa is the scaling dimension of the nearest-neighbor energy density. Comparing the

two Eq. (15) and Eq. (16), we conclude that Xa = 2Xm = 1/4 and ya = 7/4.

We verify Eq. (14) by plotting Knn versus [ln(3)/4

Knnn]7/4 for the ferromagnetic critical

−

line in Fig. 3, and for the two lines containing the algebraic phase in the antiferromagnetic

region in Fig. 4. In all these cases we ﬁnd approximate linear behavior near the decoupling

point which conﬁrms the predicted value of ya.

D. The algebraic phase

The renormalization scenario predicts that, in the algebraic phase the estimates of Xm,

as obtained from Eq. (5), will converge to a Knnn-dependent limit when the ﬁnite size L

increases. However, in the disordered and ﬂat phases, the system will renormalize away

from the nonuniversal ﬁxed line, and the data for Xm are therefore predicted to fan out for

diﬀerent values of L. We calculated Xm by solving Eq. (6) in a suitable range of Knnn at ﬁxed

values of Knn, namely Knn =

−
renormalization predictions, as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 shows that, for Knn =

−∞
and H = 0, the data of Xm converge to a Knnn-dependent constant in a range of Knnn from

−

,

0.6,

0.4,

0.2 and

0.1. These results conﬁrm the

zero to Knnn = 0.226 (2) as determined above. This conﬁrms that for H = 0, Knn =

the

−∞

system indeed remains critical until Knnn induces a transition to a ﬂat phase. In contrast,

Fig. 6 indicates that for nonzero temperature the critical phase starts at a positive value

of Knnn. Fig. 7 shows the inverse of Xm and provides a clearer picture of the transition at

the large Knnn side. We have numerically calculated the average slopes SL of the ﬁnite-size

curves in intervals speciﬁed in Table I, and ﬁt them as follows:

SL = S

+ aLyc +

,

· · ·

(17)

where S

is constant, and yc denotes the exponent of the leading ﬁnite-size correction.

∞

Results listed in Table I indicate that the ﬁnite-size dependence of the slopes is governed by

a negative exponent yc of L, which indicates that the slope SL converges to a constant for

L

, as expected in the critical range.

→ ∞
In order to provide independent conﬁrmation of the algebraic phase, we also used the

Monte Carlo method. Simulations were done for L

L systems of size L = 24, 36, 48, and

60. Examples of the results for Qs and Qm are given in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 respectively, as a

×

10

function of Knnn, for Knn =

0.2. These data behave similarly as those for Xm, and show

−

good apparent convergence to a nonuniversal, Knnn-dependent constant in the pertinent
range. Note that the curves for Qs display intersections near Knnn ≈
Qm near Knnn ≈
Fig. 2. We interpret these intersections, i.e., solutions of Eq. (6) coinciding for diﬀerent L,

0.245, apparently at diﬀerent sides of the algebraic phase as shown in

0.207, and those for

as the cancellation of the leading two L-dependent terms. Such terms are likely associated

with 1) the corrections as naturally associated with irrelevant ﬁelds in the algebraic phase;

and 2) the ‘fanning-out’ phenomenon mentioned above. It appears that the ﬁrst types of

corrections in Qs and Qm are of a diﬀerent sign.

IV. RESULTS FOR NONZERO FIELD

In view of the Ising character of (1), we restrict ourselves to H

0 without loss of gen-

≥

erality. The phase diagram without next-nearest-neighbor interactions, i.e., in the (H, Knn)

plane has already been determined by Qian et al. [12], with special emphasis on the limit
Knn → −∞
As mentioned above, the algebraic phase becomes less stable against perturbation by H

. In that limit, a roughening-type transition is located [11, 12] near H = 0.266.

when Knnn increases, and the algebraic phase in the (Knnn, H) plane shrinks to zero at

gR = 9/4 which corresponds, as mentioned above, to Knnn = 0.0185.

The line connecting the two points (Knnn, H) =(0,0.266) and (0.0185,0) is a line of rough-

ening transitions separating the algebraic and the ordered phases. The renormalization de-

scription implies that this line is a straight line when expressed in the scaling ﬁelds.

In

view of the proximity of both numerically determined points, we expect an almost straight

line in the (Knnn, H) plane. The connection of the three-state Potts transition line and the

roughening transition point in (H, Knn) plane has been analytically investigated by Qian et

al. using renormalization arguments. Their analysis indicates that the roughening transition

at H = 0.266 is the end point of the Potts transition line in (H, Knn) plane for T

0. Their

↓

result applies similarly to other points on the line of roughening transitions. We thus believe

that this whole line serves as a frontier of the Potts critical surface, as well as the part of

the Knnn axis with gR between 9/4 and 4 as determined in Sec. III A.

Since three-state Potts universality implies Xm = 2/15 at criticality, we expect that

11

asymptotically for large L

from which one can estimate critical points by solving for one of the three variables

(Knn, Knnn, H) for speciﬁed values of the other two, and subsequent extrapolation to L =

∞
We thus calculated critical points on several lines at ﬁxed values of H. The results are shown

.

as lines connecting these points in Fig. 10. In order to zoom in on the connection of the

three-state Potts transition surface and the transition lines in the (Knnn, Knn) plane, we

have also estimated critical values of H at ﬁxed values of Knn, for a suitably chosen range

of Knnn. Results for Knn =

0.8,

0.1,

0.15 are included in Fig. 10. They ﬁt well with

−

−

−

the qualitative predictions for the shape of the critical surface [4] for small H. Furthermore,

our data for the critical points at Knnn = 0.0667, corresponding with gr = 3, agree with the

linear behavior as mentioned in Sec. III A.

Our results conﬁrm that, when the next-nearest-neighbor coupling Knnn becomes suﬃ-

ciently strong, the transition from the disordered phase to the ordered phase changes char-

acter at a tricritical line, beyond which the transition turns ﬁrst-order. We have located the

tricritical line using transfer-matrix calculations. By solving Eqs. (6) and (9) simultaneously

for Knn and Knnn at speciﬁed values of H, we obtain results shown in Table II, and included

in Fig. 10. In comparison with transfer-matrix calculations involving only Xm, the memory

requirements are somewhat larger. As a consequence only 3 values of L up to 18 could be

used. But we found that ﬁnite-size corrections are relatively small, and we are conﬁdent

that the tricritical line is well determined.

For suﬃciently large ﬁelds H, triangles may contain at most one minus-spin and the

tricritical line approaches a tricritical lattice-gas limit. In this limit the nearest-neighbor

coupling and the ﬁeld satisfy a linear relation

Knn =

+ C.

As illustrated in Fig. 11, the numerical data ﬁt this expression well, except at small H.

In order to obtain a satisfactory ﬁt to the numerical data for H

proportional to e−

2H/3 and e−

4H/3 to Eq. (19). This ﬁt yielded C =

0.01481 (5). A similar

−

ﬁt without a term proportional to H yielded Knnn = 0.23514 (7) for the tricritical lattice

gas limit.

12

We have used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the location of the sheet of ﬁrst-

order transitions at Knnn = 0.3. We found that, depending on Knn and H, a randomly

initialized system evolved to a phase either largely magnetized, or resembling one of the

three ordered Potts states. The threshold values between these two regimes are shown by

the heavy dashed lines in Fig. 10. They ﬁt smoothly with the results obtained in the critical

range and for the tricritical line.

V. DISCUSSION

We have determined the phase diagram of the model Eq. (1) for Knnn ≥

0. We locate

a surface of phase transitions. This surface divides into a three-state Potts-like critical

sheet and a ﬁrst-order part. The two parts are separated by a tricritical line. While the

determination of tricritical line becomes less accurate for small

, our data suggest

Knn|

|

that it spans the whole range

< Knn < 0. This is in agreement with the minimal

−∞

renormalization scenario in which the tricritical line is a ﬂow line leading directly from the

decoupling point to the tricritical ﬁxed point.

For H

2H, and the next-nearest-neighbor potential as

Vnnn =

4Knnn. For Vnnn = 0 this model reduces to Baxter’s hard-hexagon lattice gas [21].

−

According to the analysis presented in Sec. IV, the tricritical line persists in the lattice-gas

limit. The Ising parameters C and Knnn determine the tricritical parameters of the lattice-

gas as µ =

2.644 (1) and Vnnn =

0.9406 (3). Our ﬁndings may be compared with those of

−

−

Verberkmoes and Nienhuis [22] for a model with Vnnn = 0 but including additional smaller

hexagons. They also report a tricritical point, attributed to an eﬀective attraction between

the hard hexagons, induced by entropic eﬀects associated with the small hexagons.

An Ising-like tricritical point is known to occur also in the analogous case of the hard-

square lattice gas [21, 23, 24]. Our result thus conﬁrms that tricriticality is a generic property

13

of hard-core lattice gases with attractive next-nearest-neighbor interactions.

Since we do not doubt the universality class of the tricritical line, we have not explicitly

determined its critical exponents. However, we remark that the fast apparent convergence

of the estimated tricritical points conﬁrms that the values of the Potts tricritical exponents

Xm and Xt, as used to solve Eqs. (6) and (9), do indeed apply.

Renormalization analysis predicts that the uniform magnetic ﬁeld H is relevant, except

for a small range 2

9/4. Thus the plane H = 0 qualiﬁes as a possible locus of new

gR ≤

≤

universality classes, in line with the existence of a critical phase such as predicted by the

renormalization scenario and conﬁrmed numerically. We ﬁnally note that the renormaliza-

tion equations for the KT transitions imply that the line of KT transitions, as shown in

Fig. 2 on the left hand boundary of the critical phase, should come in as a straight line

on the horizontal axis, in contrast with the numerical results which there display a small

part with a sudden curvature. We believe that this is a ﬁnite-size eﬀect, explained by the

same renormalization equations, which involve the marginally irrelevant temperature ﬁeld

parametrizing the line of KT transitions. This scaling ﬁeld generates slowly converging

ﬁnite-size corrections. This ﬁeld and its associated ﬁnite-size eﬀects vanish at Knn =

.

For Knn < 0 there are two more lines which represent the boundaries of a critical phase which

resembles the low-temperature phase of the XY model. The two lines appear to meet at a single

point, the decoupling point, at Knn = 0. The right hand critical line marks a roughening transition

to a ﬂat SOS phase, the left hand line a KT-like transition between the disordered and the critical

phases. The numerical errors in the ferromagnetic region are much smaller than the size of the

symbols; for the remaining data they are diﬃcult to estimate but believed to be at most of the

same order as the symbol size.

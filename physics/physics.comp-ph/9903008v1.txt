A Stochastic Tunneling Approach for Global Minimization of Complex Potential
Energy Landscapes

We investigate a novel stochastic technique for the global optimization of complex potential energy
surfaces (PES) that avoids the freezing problem of simulated annealing by allowing the dynamical
process to tunnel energetically inaccessible regions of the PES by way of a dynamically adjusted
nonlinear transformation of the original PES. We demonstrate the success of this approach, which
is characterized by a single adjustable parameter, for three generic hard minimization problems.

The development of methods that eﬃciently determine
the global minima of complex and rugged energy land-
scapes remains a challenging problem with applications
in many scientiﬁc and technological areas.
In particu-
lar for NP-hard [1,2] problems stochastic methods oﬀer
an acceptable compromise between the reliability of the
method and its computational cost. Branch-and-bound
techniques [3] oﬀer stringent error estimates but scale
exponentially in their computational eﬀort.
In many
stochastic approaches the computational cost to deter-
mine the global minimum with a given probability grows
only as a power-law with the number of variables [4].

In such techniques the global minimization is per-
formed through the simulation of a dynamical process
for a “particle” on the multi-dimensional potential en-
ergy surface. Widely used is the simulated annealing
(SA) technique [5] where the PES is explored in a se-
ries of Monte-Carlo simulations at successively decreasing
temperatures. Its success depends often strongly on the
choice of the cooling schedule, yet even the simplest geo-
metric cooling schedule is characterized by three param-
eters (starting temperature, cooling rate and number of
cooling steps) that must be optimized to obtain adequate
results. For many diﬃcult problems with rugged energy
landscapes SA suﬀers from the notorious “freezing” prob-
lem, because the escape rate from local minima diverges
with decreasing temperature. To ameliorate this problem
many variants of the original algorithm [6–8] have been
proposed. Unfortunately these proposals often increase
the number of parameters even further, which compli-
cates their application for practical problems.

In this letter we investigate the stochastic tunneling
method, a generic physically motivated generalization of
SA. This approach circumvents the “freezing” problem,
while reducing the number of problem dependent pa-
rameters to one.
In this investigation we demonstrate
the success of this approach for three hard minimization
problems: the Coulomb spin-glass (CSG), the traveling
salesman problem (TSP) and the determination of low
autocorrelation binary sequences(LABS) in comparison

with other techniques.

Method: The freezing problem in stochastic minimiza-
tion methods arises when the energy diﬀerence between
“adjacent” local minima on the PES is much smaller
than the energy of intervening transition states separat-
ing them. As an example consider the dynamics on the
model potential in Figure (1)(a). At high temperatures a
particle can still cross the barriers, but not diﬀerentiate
between the wells. As the temperature drops, the particle
will get eventually trapped with almost equal probability
in any of the wells, failing to resolve the energy diﬀerence
between them. The physical idea behind the stochastic
tunneling method is to allow the particle to “tunnel” [10]
forbidden regions of the PES, once it has been determined
that they are irrelevant for the low-energy properties of
the problem. This can be accomplished by applying a
non-linear transformation to the PES:

fSTUN(x) = 1 − exp [−γ(f (x) − f0)]

(1)

where f0 is the lowest minimum encountered by the dy-
namical process so far (see Figure (1)(b) + (c)) [9]. The
eﬀective potential preserves the locations of all minima,
but maps the entire energy space from f0 to the max-
imum of the potential onto the interval [0, 1]. At a
given ﬁnite temperature of O(1), the dynamical process
can therefore pass through energy barriers of arbitrary
height, while the low energy-region is still resolved well.
The degree of steepness of the cutoﬀ of the high-energy
regions is controlled by the tunneling parameter γ > 0.
Continously adjusting the reference energy f0 to the best
energy found so far, successively eliminates irrelevant fea-
tures of the PES that would trap the dynamical process.
To illustrate the physical content of the transformation
we consider a Monte-Carlo (MC) process at some ﬁxed
inverse temperature β on the STUN-PES. A MC-step
from x1 to x2 with ∆ = f (x2) − f (x1) is accepted with
probability ˜w1→2 = exp [−β(fSTUN(x2) − fSTUN(x1))].
In the limit γ∆ ≪ 1 this reduces to ˜w1→2 ≈ exp(− ˜β∆)
with an eﬀective, energy dependent temperature ˜β =
βγeγ(f0−f (x1)) ≤ βγ. The dynamical process on the

STUN potential energy surface with ﬁxed temperature
can thus be interpreted as an MC process with an energy
dependent temperature on the original PES. In the lat-
ter process the temperature rises rapidly when the local
energy is larger than f0 and the particle diﬀuses (or tun-
nels) freely through potential barriers of arbitrary height.
As better and better minima are found, ever larger por-
tions of the high-energy part of the PES are ﬂattened
In analogy to the SA approach this behavior can
out.
be interpreted as a self-adjusting cooling schedule that is
optimized as the simulation proceeds.

Since the transformation in equation (1) is bounded,
it is possible to further simplify the method: On the
ﬁxed energy-scale of the eﬀective potential one can dis-
tinguish between phases corresponding to a local search
and “tunneling” phases by comparing fSTUN with some
ﬁxed, problem independent predeﬁned threshold ft (see
Fig. 1(c)). For the success of the method it is essential
that the minimization process spends some time tunne-

is the best minimum found so far. All wells that lie above the
best minimum found are suppressed. If the dynamical process
can escape the well around the current ground-state estimate
it will not be trapped by local minima that are higher in en-
ergy. Wells with deeper minima are preserved and enhanced.
(c) After the next minimum to the right has been located,
wells that were still pronounced in (b) are also suppressed,
now only the wells around the improved ground-state esti-
mate and the true ground state are pronounced. Once the
true ground state has been found (not shown) all other wells
have been suppressed and will no longer trap the dynamical
process. The dotted line in (c) illustrates an energy threshold
0 < ft < 1 to classify the nature of the dynamics. In order to
conduct a successful search the dynamical process must ex-
plore both paths conﬁned to the vicinity of the present well
(fSTUN < ft) and paths that escape the well by tunneling the
barrier (fSTUN > ft). Adjusting the temperature to maintain
a particular average eﬀective energy balances the tunneling
and the local-search phases of the algorithm.

ling and some time searching at any stage of the mini-
mization process. We therefore adjust the parameter β
accordingly during the simulation: If a short-time moving
average of fSTUN exceeds the threshold fthresh ≈ 0.03, β
is reduced by some ﬁxed factor, otherwise it is increased.
Following this prescription the method is characterized
by the single problem-dependent parameter (γ).

Applications: In order to test the performance of this
algorithm we have investigated three families of compli-
cated NP-hard minimization problems. For each problem
we have determined either the exact ground-state energy
or a good estimate thereof. We computed the average er-
ror of the various optimization methods as a function of
the computational eﬀort to determine the computational
eﬀort required to reach a prescribed accuracy. For the
applications presented here we have ﬁxed the functional
form of the transformation and the “cooling schedule”
for β in order to demonstrate that these choices are suﬃ-
cient to obtain adequate results. Obviously this does not
guarantee that these choices are optimal.

(CSG) The determination of low-energy conﬁgurations
of glassy PES is a notoriously diﬃcult problem. We
have veriﬁed by direct comparison that the method con-
verges quickly to the exact ground states [11] for two-
dimensional short-range Ising spin-glasses of linear di-
mension 10 to 30 with either discrete or Gaussian distri-
butions of the coupling parameters. Next we turned to
the more demanding problem of the Coulomb spin-glass,
where classical charges {si} with si = ±1 are placed on
ﬁxed randomly chosen locations within the unit cube.

either only local (left side) or global (right side) moves as described in the text. For global moves both SA and STUN are
equally eﬃcient to obtain low-energy paths. Using only local moves the existence of barriers hampers the progress of SA. As
a result SA becomes less eﬃcient than STUN. By virtue of its temperature exchange mechanism PT also allows the random
walk to cross the barriers, but is less eﬃcient than STUN. The eﬀort is given in thousands of steps, note that the evaluation of
a local move is much less costly than that of a global move. The path-length indicate the average optimal energy for 20 runs
and the best energy found.

is minimized as a function of the distribution of the {si}.
The results of grand-canonical simulations for ten
replicas of N = 100 and N = 500 charges are shown
in Figure 2. We ﬁrst conducted twenty very long STUN
runs for each replica to determine upper bounds for the
true ground-state energy. For the same charge distribu-
tions we then averaged the error of STUN, SA, paral-
lel tempering (PT) [8] and simulated tempering(ST) [7]
for twenty runs per replica as function of the numerical
eﬀort. We found that the average STUN energy con-
verged in 106 MC-steps to within 1% of the estimated
true ground-state energy. Over two decades of the nu-
merical eﬀort we found a consistent signiﬁcant advantage
of the proposed method over the SA approach. Fitting
the curves in the ﬁgure with a power-law dependence we
estimate that STUN is two orders of magnitude more
eﬃcient than SA.

We found no consistent ranking of ST and PT relative
to SA for the two system sizes considered. Both methods
oﬀer alternative routes to overcome the freezing problem
in SA. In PT the conﬁgurations of concurrent simulations
at a variety of temperatures are occasionally exchanged.
In ST only a single simulation is undertaken, but its tem-
perature is considered to be a dynamical variable. Tem-
perature and conﬁguration are distributed according to:
p(s, T ) = e−E(s)/T −g(T ) and the weights g(T ) are op-
timized for a discretized temperature distribution, such
that all temperatures are visited with equal probability.
In both methods, a conﬁguration can escape a local min-
imum when the instantaneous temperature is increased.
The choice of the temperature set (along with values for
g(T )) is system dependent and must be optimized much

like the annealing schedule in SA. In accordance with
other studies our results indicate that ST performs signif-
icantly better than SA for long simulation times. PT was
successful only for the larger system (N=500), where it
reached the same accuracy as STUN for 106 steps. STUN
converged faster than any of the competing methods, but
showed a tendency to level oﬀ at high accuracy. In the
limit of large computational its accuracy was matched by
ST for N=100 and PT for N=500.

(TSP) The traveling salesman problem is another ubiq-
uitous NP-hard minimization problem [12,14]. We have
investigated the problem in its simplest incarnation: i.e.
as a minimization of the euclidian distance along a closed
path of N cities. Using long-range updates, i.e. the rever-
sal and exchange of paths of arbitrarily length, we found
that both SA and STUN perform about equally well and
reach the global optimum for N = 20, 50 and 100 very
quickly (see right side of Table (I)).

Nevertheless it is instructive to analyze this model
somewhat further as it provides insight into the inter-
play of move-construction and complexity of the min-
imization problem. The unconstrained TSP is a rare
instance among NP-hard minimization problems, where
it is possible to construct eﬃcient “long-range” hops on
the PES. In most practical applications of minimization
problems related to the TSP, the construction of global
moves is severely complicated by the existence of “hard
constraints” on the routes taken. For such problems, as
well as the other examples reported here, the alteration
of just a few variables of the conﬁgurations leads to un-
acceptably high energies in almost all cases. As a result,
the construction of global moves is not an eﬃcient way

3

to facilitate the escape from local minima. When only
local moves, i.e. transpositions of two adjacent cities, are
considered high barriers that were circumvented in the
presence of global moves hamper the progress of SA. The
results on the left side of Table (I) demonstrate that in
this scenario SA performs signiﬁcantly worse than STUN.
(LABS) Finally we turn to the construction of low-
autocorrelation binary sequences [13,14]. The model can
be cast as a ground-state problem for a one-dimensional
classical spin-1/2 chain with long-range four-point inter-
actions

and is one of the hardest discrete minimization problems
known [15]. Even highly sophisticated and specialized
optimization algorithms [14] have failed to ﬁnd conﬁg-
urations anywhere near (within 20%) the ground-state
energy that can be extrapolated from exact enumeration
studies for small systems (N < 50) [16,17]. The reason
for this diﬃculty has been attributed to the “golf-course”
character of the energy landscape and there is convincing
evidence that SA will fail to converge to the ground-state
energy even in the limit of adiabatic cooling [13]. The sit-
uation is signiﬁcantly improved if the original potential
energy surface is replaced by a piecewise constant energy
surface that is obtained by a local minimization of the
original PES at each point [18]. Obviously the latter sur-
face preserves all ground-state conﬁgurations and ener-
gies of the original PES, but eliminates many “plateaus”
of the “golf-course” landscape. Using the modiﬁed energy
surface we are able to compare SA to STUN, since SA
can now determine the ground state energy of medium

systematically approaches the estimated ground-state energy,
but STUN is about two orders of magnitude more eﬃcient.

tional eﬀort. Table II summarizes the results for the aver-
age error of 20 SA and STUN runs for system sizes N=49
and N=101 as a function of the computational eﬀort. In
direct comparison we ﬁnd that STUN is two orders of
magnitude more eﬃcient than SA. Both methods are at
least a dozen orders of magnitude more eﬃcient than SA
on the original PES.

Discussion: Using three NP-hard minimization prob-
lems with high-barriers separating local minima we have
demonstrated that the stochastic tunneling approach of-
fers a reliable, generic and eﬃcient route for the determi-
nation of low-energy conﬁgurations. One chief advantage
of the method lies in the fact that only a single param-
eter must be adjusted to adapt it for a speciﬁc problem.
One of the drawbacks of STUN is that in contrast to e.g.
PT, no thermodynamic expectation values for the system
can be obtained from the simulation. Secondly, because
the non-linear transformation will map any unbounded
PES onto an interval bounded from above, the dynami-
cal process in STUN will experience “tunneling” phases
at any ﬁnite temperature. For PES that do not contain
high barriers, or in the presence of eﬃcient global moves
that circumvent such barriers, STUN may therefore be
less eﬃcient than competing methods. In many realistic
optimization problems where the construction of global
moves is exceedingly diﬃcult or very expensive the tun-
neling approach can ameliorate the diﬃculties associated
with the existence of high energy barriers that separate
local minima of the PES.

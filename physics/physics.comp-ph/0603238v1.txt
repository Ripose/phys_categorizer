SINGLE-FILE MOTION THROUGH NANOCHANNELS

Algorithm is constructed which models single-ﬁle motion of particles
interacting with each other and with the surroundings. As an example,
we present the results of Brownian Dynamics simulations of the motion of
cations moving through a short very narrow channel containing a device
called “gate”, which may open and close the channel.

1. Introduction

Nanochannel transport and physical mechanisms of its regulation are
among leading open problems in nanoscience. Its importance results from
the fact that controlled and selective ﬂow of matter through proteins in the
cell membrane – achieved by active and passive channels [1] – is one of most
important biophysical processes in living cells. On the other hand, similar
functions may be performed by synthetic nanopores which also can rectify
the ionic currents [2, 3, 4] and pump the ions against their concentration
gradients [5] and therefore may be used as simple models of biological (pro-
tein) channels, and, on the other hand, may serve as devices for manipulat-
ing the transport in the nanoscale. Therefore it is important to understand
the conditions and properties of material transport inside the nanopore.

The well-known and rather obvious property of the transport of material
through very narrow pores is that the particles (ions, molecules ...) can pass
through such channels in the form of single ﬁle only [6].

In the absence of noise (i. e., in standard Molecular Dynamics simula-
tions) time increments δt can be made arbitrarily small. This feature makes
easy (in principle, at least) to keep all particles in prescribed unchanged or-
der. In the Brownian Dynamics (BD) the action of random forces may result
in arbitrarily high velocities and arbitrarily long jumps, time increment be-
ing irrelevant in this respect. Therefore it is impossible to keep particles
in still the same ordering by reducing time increments, the more that in

(1)

2

the presence of noise the time increments cannot be arbitrary [7, 8]. Some
additional procedures are needed.

We present here the developed by us algorithm which models single-ﬁle
motion of particles interacting with each other and with the surroundings,
moving in a short very narrow channel containing a device called “gate”,
which may open and close the channel. To be speciﬁc, we shall discuss in this
paper the electrostatic and hard-sphere interactions, though the formulas
and the algorithms themselves can be easily adapted to any (sensible) form
of interactions.

2. The model

We use the simpliﬁed model which does not take into account the details
of the channel’s structure. Full MD simulations of a K+-channel, including
its molecular structure, water inside, all ions in the immediate vicinity,
etc., requires use of total number of atoms in the simulation system above
4 × 104, and time-steps 0.2 fs [9, 10]. Such simulations have also some other
drawbacks [11].

Little is known about the details of the gating mechanism, the more
that the motions of dangling ends [12] in synthetic pores are probably quite
diﬀerent from the motions of the subunits of proteins constituting the bi-
ological channels. Therefore, without entering into details of equations of
motion for the channel’s walls, we model the gating process by introducing
inside the channel the artiﬁcial device called “gate” which can either allow
or prevent the ﬂow of particles through the channel.

The main assumptions are:
(i) We simulate the motions of the particles inside the simulation zone
(SZ) of the lenght L, narrow enough to force the particles inside SZ to move
in the single-ﬁle order. Knowledge of the detailed shape (e. g. cylinder,
cone, hour-glass) is not necessary from this point of view. Regions outside
are treated as reservoirs for particles both outcoming from and ingoing into
SZ.

(ii) We neglect the motions in radial directions, and describe the parti-
cles as moving along the z-axis of the SZ only (quasi-onedimensional mo-
tion). However, the physical system (electrostatic interactions, etc.)
re-
mains three-dimensional.

(iii) The opening and closing of the channel (so-called gating process)
is modeled by the presence of the charged “gate” located inside SZ. The
state of the gate is determined by its Brownian motion (Wiener process of
intensity Qb), and by electrostatic interactions with the ions inside SZ and
with external electric ﬁeld. The gate opens when the net force exceeds some
threshold value, and closes otherwise. Minimal approach distance between

Single˙ﬁle˙motion printed on July 29, 2013

particle and gate is dcg.

(iv) The real channels exhibiting the ﬂicker noise are asymmetric and
charged. We model these properties by the mentioned above gate, and by
additional charges located outside SZ.

(v) Water molecules are not modeled explicitly but are described elec-
trostatically by an eﬀective dielectric constant and as the source of friction
and noise – as is frequently done [13].

No periodic boundary conditions are imposed. Instead, in our simula-

tions we assumed (when other rules are satisﬁed) that

(i) Particles can leave and enter the simulation zone (SZ) through both

apertures.

(ii) Particle leaves the simulation zone (and can be counted to the current
balance at the given aperture) when its center-of-mass position is smaller
than the lower threshold, or greater then the higher threshold. In our case
we accepted as thresholds the particle diameter dc and SZ length L minus
dc.

(iii) Single-ﬁle assumption implies that when one particle leaves the sim-
ulation zone, another cannot enter through the same aperture in the same
time (i. e., during the same time-step).

(iv) When rule (iii) allows, particle may enter SZ when nearest particle
In our case the smallest

is farther that the prescribed smallest distance.
distance is dc + ǫ (ǫ = 0.00001 nm).

(v) Particles enter SZ with prescribed ﬁnite probabilities P (0) and P (L),
which may be diﬀerent for diﬀerent apertures (i. e. at x = 0 and x = L).
The probabilities of entrance simulate concentrations outside SZ – the lower
concentration, the lower probability.

In our simulations we assumed that (when other rules are satisﬁed)
during one time-step only one particle may enter the SZ through a given
entrance, and, when entering, that it is located at the distance dc from the
aperture. This rule can be changed.

The Langevin-type equations of motion for the particles (cations) mov-

ing along the channel reads:

mi ˙vi = −γivi + Ri(zi) + Fi(zi) ,

˙zi = vi ,

(1)

where vi is the velocity of i-th ion, zi – the position, mi – the mass, γi –
the friction coeﬃcient, Fi(zi) – sum of deterministic forces, and Ri(zi) – the
random force.

The gate is charged to prescribed value qg = Zge, where Zg is the valence
and can be in two states: open and closed, respectively. In our simulation
important is the absolute value of the force Fg acting on the gate. We
assume Fg to be sum of deterministic and random forces described below.

4

Single˙file˙motion printed on July 29, 2013

The deterministic force Fi(zi) experienced by the cations and the gate
consist of the applied external force (voltage), and the internal Coulomb
force from other charges. The Coulomb interaction between two ions is
modiﬁed by the addition of a short-range repulsive 1/r10 force, where r is
the ion-ion distance [8].

The random force Ri acting on ions is assumed to be the thermal noise
represented by the Gaussian white noise. On the other hand the random
force experienced by the gate Rg is given by the Wiener process (gate’s
Brownian motion) Rg = Pi Ri.

In the Brownian Dynamics calculations, δt should be of the order of m/γ

[15, 7, 14]. Using the Euler scheme

m ˙v(t) + γv(t) = F (t) → m

+ γv(t) = F (t)

(2)

v(t + δt) − v(t)
δt

would lead to obviously wrong result: v(t + δt) = F (t). Therefore we use
the following scheme of discretization:

m

v(t + δt) − v(t)
δt

γ
2

+

[v(t + δt) + v(t)] = F (t)

z(t + δt) − z(t))
δt

= v(t + δt).

(3)

This computational scheme is similar, though not identical, with that de-
scribed recently in ref. [7, 14]. The “forward evaluation” (Eq.3) has stability
and accuracy implications, and [14] suggest using it for each extrapolative
force calculations.

3. Numerical results

The length of the simulation zone is L = 10 nm. This corresponds to
the real length of biological channels, and – roughly – to the length of the
narrow part of the synthetic channel reported in [12]

The net ﬂow of particles through the channel (simulation zone) was cal-
culated either by keeping the balance of particles entering and leaving both
apertures, or by counting the particles passing the gate in both directions.
Both procedures lead to the same results.

Initial values of velocities of particles were drawn from the Maxwell dis-
tribution with the variance kBT /mc. The results are insensitive on the exact
values of temperature and mass within rather wide range of temperatures
and masses.

A list of the parameters used in the BD simulations is given below:
Temperature: T = 298 K and kBT = 4, 12 × 10−21 J,

Mass: mc = 6.5 × 10−26 kg, Friction constant: γc = 2.08 × 10−12 kg/s,

Ion diameter: dc = 0.266×10−9 m,
Valences: Zc = +1, Zg = −50,
Intensity of short-range force: F 0
Intensity of noise: Qc = 0.47 × 10−9 N, Qg = 0.01Qi.
Intensity of the gate’s noise Qg is diﬀerent from cations’ one Qc (and
is taken as a free parameter) due to the diﬀerence of masses, and also due
to a kind of “stiﬀness” of (or hindrances in) the motions of channel’s walls

power spectra are dimensionless. There are data that suggest that inside

very narrow pores the physical properties of aqueous solutions, such as
dielectric constant, density, diﬀusion coeﬃcient, viscosity, solvatation of ions
(i. e., their eﬀective diameters), etc. may diﬀer from their bulk values [17].
Therefore we checked how the changes of such parameters inﬂuence our
model. We found that the quantitative changes of calculated values of net
currents and of frequency spectra resulting from reasonable variations of
these parameters are within the limits of quantitative diﬀerences resulting
from diﬀerent realizations of the noise. The results are shown in Figs.1–3.
These observations suggest robustness of the model. On the other hand,
the model is sensitive with respect to the changes of relative strength of
random and deterministic forces – decrease of the dielectric constant with
noise unchanged, or increase of noise with electrostatic forces unchanged
changed signiﬁcantly the results. E. g., either too strong gate noise or too
strong electrostatic force (i. e., low dielectric constant) dampen the ﬂicker
noise.

When the single-ﬁle limitations are removed, all the power spectra shown
in Figs. 1-3 become S(f ) ∼ f −1.5, i .e, the corresponding processes behave
like the Wiener process.

4. Appendix

Here we present the codes for the single-ﬁle motion. The codes for
entrances and exits of particles, for the number of particles located to the

left of the gate, as well as the codes for the determination of the state of
the gate (open or closed), and for the equations of motion are standard and
will not be reproduced here.

Single-ﬁle procedures are based on the fact that the given particle (cation)
i cannot move farther that its neighbours i − 1 and i + 1, which in turn are
limited by their neighbours, i and i − 2 or i + 2, etc. Therefore their po-
sitions need to be recalculated. In the simplest version, it is assumed that
particles meet at the middle of their former positions. In the better versions
such a pair of particles meets at the position calculated from their former
positions and from their new velocities. On the other hand, the particles
retain their velocities until a given pair meets, then they collide and – in
the simplest version – exchange their velocities (behave as hard spheres).
Again, it is possible to reﬁne this simplest procedure. Because the results
of the above-described procedure depend on whether the recalculations are
done“up” or “down”, i.e., from particle number 1 to N , or from N to 1,
both reorderings are realized independently, their results are averaged, and
the whole scheme is iterated until self-consistency is attained.

Before using the SFM-codes below, one needs to supply the values of
entries of three main arrays: ZK[Nkmax], VK[Nkmax], in which the po-
sitions and velocities of particles inside the simulation zone are stored,
ZK0[Nkmax] in which former positions are remembered, and two auxiliary
ones: ZKG[Nkmax] and ZKH[Nkmax] for storing intermediate data. It is
needless to say that these arrays should be declared as external variables.

Nkmax denotes here the maximal, Nk (in the codes) – the actual number

of particles inside the simulation zone.

We present here separate single-ﬁle codes for open and for closed channel.

8

Before calling the S-F code for a closed channel, one needs to calculate the
number of particles located to the left of the gate, denoted in the codes as
Nkgl.

nrep = 0; repeat = 1;
while(repeat == 1 && Nk > 1)

orderup(0,Nk-1,Nk,dcc); // pairs (Nk,Nk-1),...(2,1)
ave(1,Nk);

// single-file ordering: closed channel

}

while(repeat == 1)
{

repeat = 0; nrep++;

if(Nkgl < Nk)
{

(lines ZKH[i] = 0.5(ZK0[i] + ZK0[i+1] - d), ZKG[i] = 0.5(ZK0[i] +
ZK0[i-1] + d)) the simplest form of the recalculations of the correct po-
sitions of pairs of particles as contact positions of the pair in the middle
of their former positions. These positions can be determined with better
accuracy by taking into account particles’ velocities, and their equations of
motion as well. The appropriate codes are obvious and are not reproduced
here.

These codes can be written in a more compact way. The form presented

here is – in our opinion – better legible and more self-explanatory.

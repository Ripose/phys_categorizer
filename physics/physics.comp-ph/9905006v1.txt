A CONSISTENT COMPUTATIONAL

TIME-DEPENDENT ELECTRON-EXCHANGE THEORY

WITH NON-REDUNDANT TIME EVOLUTION

Charles A. Weatherford

Abstract

In the present work, a new time-dependent exchange theory is presented wherein the sym-

metry constraints, on a multi-electron wavefunction, are properly accounted for.

In so

doing, the equations of motion, incorporating the required symmetry, are derived and a

solution algorithm employing an implicit split-operator procedure is described. A tech-

nique (using an orthonormalization transformation and a unitary rotation), for explicitly

enforcing the required constraints, which render the computations tractible and provide

for non-redundant time evolution, is also presented. This amounts to the calculation of the

appropriate numerically determined guage. The invariance of the derived orbital equations

of motion with respect to the transformations is explicitly demonstrated.

I. INTRODUCTION

The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE)

i

d
dt

Ψ = ˆHΨ

(1)

describes the dynamics of quantum mechanical systems, and in particular is applicable

to systems consisting of N -electrons. The present application is restricted to atomic and

molecular systems with all nuclei ﬁxed in space (assumed inﬁnitely massive). Note that

atomic units are used throughout this work.[1] In these units, ¯h = me = e = 1, where ¯h is

Planck’s constant divided by 2π, me is the electron mass, and e is the electron charge. Ψ is

the system wavefunction and is a function of time (t) and of the coordinates of the particles
making up the system. ˆH is the Hamiltonian operator and consists of the kinetic energy

operators of all of the particles in the system, plus the interaction potential between the
particles as well as any external potential. In general, ˆH might explicitly depend on time

through the external interaction potential, and while this would present no fundamental
complication, the present work assumes ˆH does not explicitly depend on time. Also, in

order to make the essential points of the present work, the number of electrons will be

restricted to two. This would seem at ﬁrst to be a drastic reduction in complexity, which

of course it is, but the essential points can be made most clearly for two electron systems,

and indeed, two electron systems, such as the hydrogen molecule (H2), electron-hydrogen

atom (e + H) scattering, and the helium atom (He), are important systems.

The TDSE represents an initial value problem such that if the value of the wavefunc-

tion at t = 0 is speciﬁed, and if the TDSE can be accurately solved, then the quantum

mechanical dynamics will be encoded in the solution (wavefunction) at t =

or an approx-

∞

imation thereunto. In section II, the multiconﬁgurational time-dependent exchange theory

will be presented in a form which is specialized to two-electron systems. In addition, since

much of the present development is herein presented for the ﬁrst time, only one orbital per

particle will explicitly be considered. It should be noted that the present formulation can

be viewed as a modiﬁcation of the multiconﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH)

1

theory of Manthe, Meyer, and Cederbaum,[2,3] appropriate for fermions, and as such, it

may be generalized to several fermions and multi-function representations of each one. But

in addition, the present paper presents an explicit prescription for enforcing the required

constraints on the time-dependent orbitals such that “non-redundant time evolution” is

guaranteed–this appears to be a new contribution, along with the new explicit treatment

of the exchange symmetry and the very compact form of the EOM. Section II.A derives

the equations of motion (EOM) assuming orbital orthonormality and non-redundant time

evolution; Section II.B presents the derivation of the transformations–(1) an orthonormal-

ization matrix and (2) a unitary rotation matrix, which is the solution of a ﬁrst order

diﬀerential equation in time. The application of these two orbital transformations results

in orbital orthonormality and non-reduntant orbital time evolution; Section II.C demon-

strates the invariance of the EOM with respect to the two transformations; Section III

describes a solution algorithm using an implicit split-operator procedure (ISOP)[4,5]. Fi-

nally, section IV will present the conclusions.

thus the TDSE is represented as

As speciﬁed above, the present development is applied to two-electron systems and

i

d
dt

Ψ(1, 2) = ˆH(1, 2)Ψ(1, 2)

(2)

where the notation for Ψ stands for Ψ(1, 2) = Ψ(~r1, ~r2; t), and ˆH(1, 2) = ˆH(~r1, ~r2) such

that the time dependence is assumed for all wavefunctions and orbitals (to be deﬁned

below)–the Hamiltonian however is assumed to have no explicit time dependence. For a

two-electron system, the wavefunction factors into a space part times a spin part and the

total wavefunction must be completely antisymmetric with respect to electron exchange.[6]

The spin states are either singlets or triplets. The Hamiltonian is spin independent at the

2

level of theory under consideration. More explicitly, the Hamiltonian is given by

ˆH(1, 2) = ˆH0(1) + ˆH0(2) + V (1, 2) = ˆH0(1, 2) + V (1, 2)

(3)

where ˆH0(j) = ˆT0(j) + V0(j) and ˆT0(j) =
ˆH(1, 2) is also.

. Note that if V (1, 2) is symmetric, then

For a two-electron system, the spatial wavefunction, corresponding to a spin singlet

(Ψ(+)), is symmetric with respect to exchange, while the spatial part is antisymmetric

for a spin triplet (Ψ(

)). The spatial wavefunction then depends on the spatial parts of

−

the two electrons and on time. It resides in a six dimensional (6D) coordinate space. If

it were practical, the full six spatial dimensional wavefunction would be propagated in

time. However, this is not practical at the present stage of computer technology–it may

be in the near future however. Certainly, for systems composed of three or more electrons,

the full dimensional solution is not available and will not be for the forseeable future.

Thus, a decomposition into a direct product of three dimensional (3D) subspaces (one

for each electron) is the advisable procedure. Then, the spatial part of the two-electron

wavefunction may then be expanded, at the minimal expansion length, in the manner of

[2,3], as

Consistent with the decomposition of the 6D space into a direct product of 3D sub-

spaces, the objective is to derive two coupled time-dependent 3D equations for the one-

electron orbitals.

In addition, time-dependent equations for the purely time-dependent

coeﬃcients need to be derived (three for the singlet and one for the triplet–see Eq. (4)).

Now in general, the φ’s are not necessarily computationally orthonormal because of

numerical inaccuracies. If Eqs. (5) are substituted into Eqs. (4), which are then substituted
into Eq. (2), aside from nonzero oﬀ-diagonal, and non-unit diagonal, overlaps S(φ,

where the ‘over-dot’ represents a time derivative, will appear in the equations. One of

the principal distinctions of the MCTDH theory of [2,3] is the use of the purely time-

dependent coeﬃcients, as indicated in Eqs. (4), as contrasted with, for example, a time-

dependent Hartree-Fock theory (TDHF) [7], wherein the time-dependence is described

solely by the one-electron orbitals. As pointed out in [2,3], this additional set of time-

dependent coeﬁcients produces a redundant description which allows for the incorporation

all i, j. Actually, the diagonal overlaps are arbitrary constants which may be set to one.

In section II.B below, a systematic way of implementing these constraints will be given.

In so doing, it will be seen that the enforcement of orthonormality and non-reduntant

time-evolution, must be done in two diﬀerent transformation steps, separated in sequence

by the time propagation over the time interval ∆t.

The derivation of the EOM proceeds by a projection method. A critical property in the

derivation by projection of the EOM for the A’s is the orthonormality of the two-electron

conﬁguration functions such that

conﬁguration functions

These relations follow immediately from the orthonormality of the ψ’s and the zero values

of the one-electron derivative overlap matrix elements. The procedure is thus to substitute

Eqs. (10) into Eqs. (9), and then to use the result in Eq. (2). Then project from the left
by Φ(ψ,

II.B Orbital Transformations

In the derivation of the EOM [Eqs. (14,19)] using the ψ-basis, it has been assumed

that S(ψ,

made in the deriving the EOM, does not automatically result in the enforcement of the

constraints expressed in the two assumptions. It is well known that if the multielectron

time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is solved exactly as an N -electron problem, without

the orbital direct product ansatz, and if the wave function at t = 0 is orthonormal, then,

in principle, the wave function should remain orthonormal for all time. However, compu-

tational errors will inevitably accrue and destroy this orthonormality. For an orbital direct

product decomposition, this orthonormality assumption is in principal, still valid, subject

to numerical inaccuracies. If this orbital orthonormality is lost because of numerical in-

accuracies, it is not suﬃcient to just re-orthonormalize without appropriately modifying

the other terms which appear in the EOM–in fact, the EOM should be invariant with

respect to this orthonormalization transformation. It is one of the salient features of the

present work, that this invariance is explicit for the EOM derived herein. This invariance

is demonstrated below. Also, a procedure for enforcement is described.
It can be easily shown that if in some basis (ψ for example) S(ψ,

) + D(ψ,
D-matrix is anti-hermitian (e.g. D(ψ,

then D(ψ,
) where C(ψ,

II.B-2 Unitary Rotation Transformation

In this section, it is assumed that the EOM in the φ-set has been solved over the

interval ∆t so that the D-matrix in the φ-set can be calculated at the R-end of the time

interval. Thus, this section is concerned with the following derivative overlap matrices

calculated at the R-end of the time interval:

The objective is to ﬁnd a unitary transformation (at the R-end of the time interval) of the
φ-set to the ψ-set, such that D(ψ,

) = 1. Thus the transformation is represented by

±

ν
X
or in matrix notation, this is described by Eq. (7) above. Note that the overlaps, given by

Clearly, if the φ-set is orthonormal, and if b is unitary, then the ψ-set is orthonormal.

Now, if Eq. (33) is used in Eq. (32), then

˙b(

Now D(φ,

) is anti-hermitian since the ψ-set is orthonormal, as can be seen from Eq.

(34), given the orthonormality of the φ-set. It is then known [7] that use of the Cayley
decomposition to propagate b± in time, will preserve unitarity. Therefore, if Eq. (36) is
solved, using D(φ,
) will be calculated at the R-end such that
D(ψ,

) at the R-end, then b(

) = 0 at the R-end.

II.C EOM Invariance

The objective of this section is to show the invariance of the EOM with respect to
the orthonormalization transformation (X) and the rotation matrix (b). This will be done

11

by ﬁrst surmising a compact form for the full two-electron wave function (see Eq. (2)),

and then deriving the EOM without assuming orthonormality or null D-matrices, for each

of the three bases (χ, φ, ψ). It will then be shown that the resultant EOM are invariant
in form with respect to the linear transformations given by X and b. Note that, from

hereon, unless otherwise noted, the

notation will be dropped with the understanding

±

that the distinction still applies. Collecting some pertinent formulas for reference, we show

the following, which are inferred from Eqs. (4, 20, and 24) above:

The actual orbital transformations have been given by Eqs. (7, 27). It must be shown that

the EOM are invariant with respect to the two transformations. To this end, the EOM

are derived below without assuming orthonormality or a null D-matrix.

Begin by substituting Eq. (37a) into Eq. (2), multiplying from the left by ˜~χ(1) and

integrating over the coordinates of ~r(1)–the result is

D(χ)a(χ)~χ + S(χ) ˙a(χ)~χ + S(χ)a(χ) ˙~χ = ˆh(χ)a(χ)~χ

with. Inverting Eqs. (41) results in

III. USE OF THE ISOP ALGORITHM

The ISOP algorithm[4] has been applied to several problems [4,5] including the inte-

gration of two coupled equations resulting from a time-dependent Hartree ansatz applied to

H2.[5] The ISOP algorithm is a two-time-step algorithm and involves (as indicated above)

a time interval ∆t, the retarded time (R), at the R-end of ∆t, and the advanced time at the

A-end. The present equations are nonlinear equations–this presents no essential diﬃculty

however. It is possible, as we demonstrate below, to decompose the solution into steps so

as to in eﬀect render the equations linear from a computational point of view. The basic

computational tool used in taking time derivatives in the ISOP is the Cayley formula.[7]

In order to use the ISOP to integrate the orbital equations, the singlet and triplet

(cid:2)

cases are considered separately again. The ISOP may now be applied directly to Eq. (19).
Using the deﬁnitions of ˆT0(j) and V0(j) immediately below Eq. (3), Eq. (19) may be

written as (the explicit reference to particle coordinates is dropped)

where

such that ˆh0 is the same as ˆh in Eq. (23), except with ˆH(1, 2) replaced by ˆH0(1, 2) (see
Eq. (3)). Also V is the same as ˆh except V (1, 2) replaces ˆH(1, 2).

Step 14:

let the advanced time become the retarded time for another time interval

and then go to step 3 and continue.

If an exit of the basic algorithm occurs because of the lack of orbital orthonormality or

17

the lack of a null D-matrix, the “Correction Algorithm” is implemented, for the particular

∆t in question, as follows:

Correction Algorithm

Step 1: assume CR = 1;
Step 2: calculate ΓR using Eq. (53);
Step 3: calculate CA using Eq. (59);
Step 4: calculate ~ψA using Eqs. (41);
Step 5: calculate a(ψ)
Step 6: calculate ˆh(ψ)

A using Eq. (48);

Step 7: let the advanced time become the retarded time for another time interval and

then go to step 4 of the “Basic Algorithm” and continue (letting ψ

Thus, the solution may be eﬃciently propagated in time in a way that guarantees orbital

orthonormality and a null D-matrix (non-reduntant time evolution).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Now returning to the TDHF[9], the one-electron orbitals are assumed orthonormal and

the derivative matrix elements are set to zero. This is possible in the context of the TDHF

because the EOM are derived using the Dirac-Frenkel variational principal (DFVP).[10,11]

In fact, orthonormality of the one-electron orbitals and zero D-matrices are not restrictive

in the context of the TDHF. This can be demonstrated by a set of guage transformations

in the manner of Refs. (5) and (9). The key idea of the TDHF derivation using the DFVP

is the independent variation of the one-electron orbitals.[9] The authors of Refs. (2) and

(3) also use the DFVP to derive their EOM for a Hartree-like ansatz which is used for

distinguishable particles. The present derivation of a set of exchange equations proceeds in

the manner of Ref. (5)–that is by projections. It is necessary to have a way of determining

the D-matrices. This is so because the time derivative that appears inside the spatial

integral is at the same time-step as the time-derivative of the Schr¨odinger equation itself.

18

This results in the necessity of a self-consistent procedure at each time-step–an operation

that needs to be avoided if possible.

If projections are used to derive the two coupled

equations for the one-electron orbitals, the D-matrices can not be set to zero without a

“hidden symmetry” analysis similar to that given above. This in fact has been done.[12]

The equations that result from that procedure are distinctly diﬀerent from the TDHF

equations.

conﬁguration.

The present work is an alternative derivation of a set of time-dependent exchange

equations (TDEEs), which follows immediately from the MCTDH theory of [2,3]. The

present equations are derived by a projection procedure, but are exactly the same equa-

tions that would be produced by the DFVP. This all results from the reduntancy which

follows from the use of the purely time-dependent coeﬃcients multiplying each two-electron

An algorithm for the solution of the new exchange equations has been given using the

ISOP method and a procedure was described to enforce orbital orthonormality and a null

D-matrix. This allows for a non-reduntant time evolution.

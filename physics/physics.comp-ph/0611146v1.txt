Abstract

The Lagrange mesh method is a very simple procedure to accurately solve eigenvalue problems

starting from a given nonrelativistic or semirelativistic two-body Hamiltonian with local or nonlo-

cal potential. We show in this work that it can be applied to solve the inverse problem, namely,

to ﬁnd the equivalent local potential starting from a particular bound state wave function and

the corresponding energy. In order to check the method, we apply it to several cases which are

analytically solvable: the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator and Coulomb potential, the nonlo-

cal Yamaguchi potential and the semirelativistic harmonic oscillator. The potential is accurately

computed in each case. In particular, our procedure deals eﬃciently with both nonrelativistic and

semirelativistic kinematics.

INTRODUCTION

The Lagrange mesh method is a very accurate and simple procedure to compute eigen-

values and eigenfunctions of a two-body Schr¨odinger equation [1, 2, 3]. It is applicable for

both local and nonlocal interactions [4], and also for a semirelativistic kinetic operator, i.e.

the spinless Salpeter equation [5, 6]. In this method, the trial eigenstates are developed in

a basis of well-chosen functions, the Lagrange functions, and the Hamiltonian matrix ele-

ments are obtained with a Gauss quadrature. Moreover, the Lagrange mesh method can be

extended to treat very accurately three-body problems, in nuclear or atomic physics [7, 8].

In this work, we apply the Lagrange mesh method to solve the inverse problem for bound

states: starting from a given bound state – wave function and corresponding eigenenergy –,

we show how to compute the equivalent local potential. To our knowledge, this application

of Lagrange mesh method has not been studied before. It can then be used to compute

the equivalent local potential of a given nonlocal potential. The determination of equivalent

local potentials is of particular interest in nuclear physics (see for example Ref. [9]). The

more interesting point is that our procedure allows to deal with semirelativistic kinematics.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we recall the main points of the Lagrange

mesh method and show how to apply it to solve a bound state problem with a central

potential. Then, we give a procedure to compute the equivalent local potential with this

method starting from a given spectrum in Sec. III. In order to check the eﬃciency of our

method, we apply it to several cases in which the spectrum is analytically known. Firstly, we

consider three central potentials with a nonrelativistic kinematics in Sec. IV: the harmonic

oscillator (Sec. IV A), the Coulomb potential (Sec. IV B), and the nonlocal Yamaguchi po-

tential (Sec. IV C). Secondly, in Sec. V, we consider the case of the semirelativistic harmonic

oscillator for two massless particles, whose solution is also analytical. The accuracy of the

method is checked in all those cases, and conclusions are drawn in Sec. VI.

II. LAGRANGE MESH METHOD

A Lagrange mesh is formed of N mesh points xi associated with an orthonormal set of

indeﬁnitely derivable functions fj(x) on an interval [a, b]. A Lagrange function fj(x) vanishes

The weights λi are linked to the mesh points xi through a Gauss quadrature formula

which is used to compute all the integrals over the interval [a, b].

As in this work we only study radial equations, we consider the interval [0,

[, leading

to a Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The Gauss formula (2) is exact when g(x) is a polynomial

of degree 2N

1 at most, multiplied by exp(

x). The N Lagrange-Laguerre mesh points xi

are then given by the zeros of the Laguerre polynomial LN (x) of degree N [1]. An explicit

form can be derived for the corresponding regularized Lagrange functions

They clearly satisfy the constraint (1), and they are orthonormal, provided the scalar prod-

ucts are computed with the quadrature (2). Moreover, they vanish in x = 0.

To show how these elements can be applied to a physical problem, let us consider a
standard Hamiltonian H = T (~p 2) + V (r), where T (~p 2) is the kinetic term and V (r) a radial

potential (we work in natural units ¯h = c = 1). The calculations are performed with trial

variational parameters. h is a scale parameter chosen to adjust the size of the mesh to the

domain of physical interest. If we deﬁne r = h x, with x a dimensionless variable, a relevant

value of h will be obtained thanks to the relation h = ra/xN , where xN is the last mesh

point and ra is a physical radius for which the asymptotic tail of the wave function is well

deﬁned. This radius has to be a priori estimated, but various computations show that it has

not to be known with great accuracy, since the method is not variational in h [5, 10].

We have now to compute the Hamiltonian matrix elements. Let us begin with the po-

tential term. Using the properties of the Lagrange functions and the Gauss quadrature (2),

the potential matrix for a local potential V (r) is diagonal. Its elements are

and only involve the value of the potential at the mesh points. As the matrix elements are

computed only approximately, the variational character of the method cannot be guaranteed.

But the accuracy of the method is preserved [11]. The matrix elements for a nonlocal

potential W (r, r′) are given by [4]

3. Determination of the matrix elements Tij in the Lagrange basis by using the transfor-

mation matrix S: T (~p 2) = S T (D2) S−1.

Note that such a calculation is not exact because the number of Lagrange functions is
ﬁnite. However, it has already given good results in the semirelativistic case, when T (~p 2) =

~p 2 + m2 [5] or even when T (~p 2, r) =

~p 2 + U 2(r) [6].

But contrary to some other mesh methods, the wave function is also known everywhere

thanks to Eq. (4).

III. BOUND STATE EQUIVALENT LOCAL POTENTIAL

In the previous section, we applied the Lagrange mesh method to solve the eigenequation

for two-body central problems. We now show that this method allows to solve very easily

the inverse problem, that is, starting from particular wave function

and energy E, to

ﬁnd the corresponding equivalent local potential for a given kinematics T .

We see from the above equation that, provided we know the radial wave function and the

energy of the state, the equivalent local potential can be directly computed at the mesh

points. Let us note that, since the matrix elements Tij depend on the orbital angular

momentum ℓ, this quantum number has to be a priori speciﬁed. The calculation is done

easily because the potential matrix for a local potential V (r) is diagonal and only involves

the value of the potential at the mesh points, as shown in Eq. (6). Obviously, this method

does not require a given normalization for the wave function. Moreover, it is also applicable

for semirelativistic kinematics.

We can remark that Eq. (11) contains term which are proportional to u(hxj)/u(hxi).

They may be diﬃcult to compute numerically with a great accuracy when hxi is either close

to zero or very large. In these cases indeed, the regularized wave function tends towards zero.

It means that the ﬁrst values of the potential and also the last ones could be inaccurate.

It is worth mentioning that, for radially excited states, a particular mesh point xk could

be such that hxk is a zero of the wave function. In this case, V (hxk) cannot be computed.

Although very improbable, this problem could simply be cured by taking a slightly diﬀerent

value of N or h.

In order to check the validity of our method, we will consider four cases where the

eigenvalue problem is analytically solvable for a given potential V E. This will enable us

5

to compare the numerically computed points V (hxi) with the corresponding exact values
V E(hxi). The number δ, deﬁned by

is a measurement of the accuracy of the numerical computations. The more δ is close to

zero, the more the method is accurate. The ﬁrst and last two mesh points are – arbitrarily

– not included in the computation of δ, since they can introduce errors which are not due

(12)

to the method itself, but rather to a lack of precision in the numerical computations, as we

argued previously from inspection of formula (11).

where the factor 4 ensures that the last mesh point will be located in the asymptotic tail of

the wave function.

6

In order to make explicit computations, we have to specify the value of our parameters.
We set µ = 0.70 GeV and Λ = 0.53 GeV2. These parameters can be used in hadron physics

to roughly describe a c¯c meson [10, 13]. We choose N = 30, and the scale parameter is

computed by using Eq. (17). Once these parameters are ﬁxed, Eqs. (11) and (15) allow to

ﬁnd the equivalent local potential. The result is plotted and compared to the exact harmonic

potential (14) in Fig. 1, where we used the wave function in the 2S state (n = 1, ℓ = 0).

The numerical result is clearly close to the exact result, and only 30 mesh points are enough
to provide a good picture of the potential: we have indeed δ = 2.1 10−3 %, this number

being computed with Eq. (12). The same conclusion holds if other states than the 2S one

are used, and δ is always smaller than 1 %.

In Fig. 2, we show the variation of δ with the scale parameter h for three diﬀerent states

and N = 30. We can conclude from this ﬁgure that a rather large interval exists where

the quantity δ is lower than 1 %. Consequently, the scale parameter does not need to

be computed with great accuracy: our criterion (16) is clearly accurate enough since the

predicted value of h is always located in this interval. The global behavior of δ which can be

observed in Fig. 2 is due the diﬃculty of computing V (hxi) when the scale parameter is too

small or too large. In this case indeed, the mesh points hxi cover no longer the main part

of the wave function, and a partial knowledge of the wave function leads to an inaccurate

description of the potential.

B. Coulomb potential

This case is of interest since it enables us to check whether the method we present can

correctly reproduce a singular potential or not. The radial wave function and eigenenergies

7

It can be computed that [14, p. 147]

As the evaluation of the scale parameter given by Eq. (16) yields good results in the harmonic

oscillator case, it can be adapted to the Coulomb potential, and h is now deﬁned as

(21)

A factor 15 is now needed because the Coulomb potential is a long- ranged one. The wave

function has thus to be known on a larger domain than for the harmonic oscillator, since

the latter potential is a conﬁning one.

In order to numerically compute the equivalent potential from the wave function (19),

we set µ = 0.70 GeV and κ = 0.27. The particular value of κ we chose is commonly used

in hadron physics to parameterize the one-gluon-exchange part of the potential between

two heavy quarks [10]. We choose N = 30, and the scale parameter is computed by using

Eq. (21). The result is plotted and compared to the exact Coulomb potential (18) in Fig. 3

for the wave function in the ground state (n = ℓ = 0). The numerical result is close to
the exact result, with a value of δ which is equal to 1.4 10−5 %. In particular, the singular

behavior is well reproduced. To stress this point, we performed another calculation with
N = 100, and h = 0.37 GeV−1 following Eq. (21).

It can be seen in Fig. 3 that the

Coulomb potential is then very well matched at short distances. In this case however, we

have δ = 0.7 %. Although this precision is still very satisfactory, it seems strange at ﬁrst

sight that δ is higher for a larger number of mesh points. This is due to the fact that the

mesh points are the zeros of the Laguerre polynomial of degree N. The ﬁrst physical point

which is taken into account in the deﬁnition of δ is hx3, which is smaller for N = 100
(hx3 = 0.811 GeV−1) than for N = 30 (hx3 = 0.068 GeV−1). This causes δ to be larger,

since the more a point is close to zero, the more the accuracy decreases.

For what concerns the variation of δ versus h, the same qualitative features than for the

harmonic oscillator are observed. Equation (21) thus appears to give a good evaluation of

the scale parameter. It can be also checked that a factor smaller than 15 in Eq. (21) can

lead to values of the scale parameter for which δ is quite larger than 1 %.

C. Yamaguchi potential

The Yamaguchi potential is a separable nonlocal potential, given by

with

W (r, r′) =

v(r) v(r′),

−

v(r) =

β/µ (α + β) e−βr.

It was introduced in Ref. [15] to study the deuteron (µ = 0.468 GeV). In particular, for

p

α = 0.046 GeV and β = 0.274 GeV, it admits a bound state whose binding energy is the

one of the deuteron, that is E =

2.225 MeV.

−

A nice particularity of this nonlocal potential is that the bound state wave function can

be analytically determined. It reads

R(r)

∝

e−βr

.

−

Inserting this wave function into Eq. (11) will provide us with the equivalent local potential

associated with the Yamaguchi potential. Finding equivalent local potentials coming from

nonlocal potentials is of interest in nuclear physics, although most studies are devoted to

scattering states (see for example Refs. [9]). The bound state equivalent potential of a

separable nonlocal potential of the form (22) is shown in Ref. [16] to be given by

The equivalent local potential V L(r) and the one computed with the Lagrange mesh

method can be compared in Fig. 4. The deuteron parameters are used, together with N = 30

and h given by Eq. (28). The agreement is satisfactory since δ = 0.31 %. The extension

of the wave function is large because the deuteron is weakly bound. An estimation of its
radius is indeed given by 1.96 fm in Ref. [17], that is the rather large value of 9.9 GeV−1.

V. THE SEMIRELATIVISTIC HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

A nice feature of the Lagrange mesh method is that it allows to solve semirelativistic

Hamiltonians like the spinless Salpeter equation or the relativistic ﬂux tube model [10, 18],

which are relevant in quark physics. Equation (11) is consequently applicable if the kinetic

operator is given by

Thanks to the particular properties of the Airy function, it can be computed that [21]

The scale parameter will thus be computed with the relation

in analogy with the similar case of the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator.

is given in Fig. 5. The value Ω = 0.2 GeV3 is typical for potential models of light quarks

[13]. But, we present our results as dimensionless quantities. The curves are thus universal:

they do not dependent on Ω, which is the only parameter of this Hamiltonian. Although

still satisfactory, the agreement is not as good as with the nonrelativistic applications. We

ﬁnd indeed δ = 3.1 %. By inspection of Fig. 5, it can be seen that the last points slightly

diﬀer from the exact curve. These points are related to the value of the wave function in

its asymptotic tail, as it can be seen from Eq. (11). It means that ﬁnding the equivalent

potential, especially with a semirelativistic kinematics, needs a good knowledge of the tail,

which is not often necessary for computation of the energy spectra.

In our case, the discrepancies for the last points are due to the computation of the wave

function in the asymptotic regime. It can be checked that a resolution of Hamiltonian (30)

with the Lagrange mesh method leads to a wave function which asymptotically decreases

faster than the exact wave function, given by Eq. (31). Conversely, if one starts from the

exact wave function, the Lagrange mesh procedure will lead to a potential which does not

increase enough asymptotically, as we observe in Fig. 5. Fortunately, only the very last points

are aﬀected, as it is shown in Fig. 6. By varying N and h, that is to say by varying the

interval where the potential is computed, one can always correctly reproduce the potential

in a given region: the more hxN is large, the larger is the interval where the potential is

correctly reproduced. Finding the equivalent potential with a spinless Salpeter equation

seems thus to require a more careful study: several curves have to be computed by varying

h and N in order to understand whether the long range behavior of the potential is physical

or simply due to a numerical artifact.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

In this work, we extended the domain of application of the Lagrange mesh method to a

particular type of problem: to ﬁnd the equivalent local potential corresponding to a given

bound state with a given kinematics. We assumed a central problem. Starting from a

particular radial wave function and the corresponding energy, the method we presented here

allows to compute the equivalent local potential at the mesh points. We checked the accuracy

of the computations in various cases whose solutions are analytically known. Firstly, we

studied the well-known nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator and Coulomb potentials. These

11

potentials are correctly reproduced by the Lagrange mesh method with a precision better

than 1 %, provided the scale parameter is large enough to take into account the asymptotic

tail of the wave function. Moreover, the singularity of the Coulomb potential is well matched.

The numerical parameters are the number of mesh points, and the scale parameter.

It

appears that a typical value of 30 mesh points is enough to provide a good picture of the

potential. As it was the case for usual eigenvalue problems, the scale parameter does not

need to be accurately determined: a rather large interval exists where the precision is lower

than 1 %.

If the spectrum comes from a nonlocal potential, our method will compute the equivalent

local potential. This problem is of interest in nuclear physics [9]. As an illustration, we

applied it to the nonlocal Yamaguchi potential describing the deuteron. In this particular

case, the spectrum is analytical as well as the corresponding equivalent potential. Again,

the accuracy of our method is very good.

Finally, our procedure can also be easily adapted to the case of a semirelativistic kine-

matics. As a check, we studied the semirelativistic harmonic oscillator. Again, the potential

is correctly reproduced, but it appears that the asymptotic behavior of the potential is prob-

lematic. This is an artifact of the method in the semirelativistic case: by varying the mesh

size, one can indeed see that the value of the potential at the last mesh points is systemati-

cally too low, but the harmonic shape of the potential is well reproduced at the other mesh

points.

Our purpose is to apply this method to the study of systems containing quarks and

gluons.

In particular, glueballs, which are bound states of gluons, are very interesting

systems because their existence is directly related to the nonabelian nature of QCD. Bound

states of two gluons can be described within the framework of potential models by a spinless

Salpeter equation with a Cornell potential: a linear conﬁning term plus a Coulomb term

coming from short-range interactions [22]. Such a phenomenological potential has been

shown to arise from QCD in the case of a quark-antiquark bound state [23]. Theoretical

indications show that it could be valid also for glueballs [24]. Moreover, recently, the mass
and the wave function of the scalar glueball (with quantum numbers J P C = 0++) has been

computed in lattice QCD [25]. Thanks to the Lagrange mesh method, these data could be

used to extract the potential between two gluons from lattice QCD, and see whether it is a

Cornell one or not. This study will be published elsewhere.

FIG. 1: Comparison between the potential computed from the 2S wave function (15) thanks to the

Lagrange mesh formula (11), and the exact harmonic potential given by Eq. (14). The equivalent

potential is only known at the mesh points (circles), and the exact potential is plotted with a solid

line. The regularized wave function is also plotted with an arbitrary normalization (dashed line).

We used µ = 0.70 GeV, Λ = 0.53 GeV 2, N = 30, and h = 9.8 10−2 GeV−1 following formula (17).

FIG. 2: Evolution of δ versus the scale parameter h for the 1S (full circles), 1P (empty circles), and

2S (triangles) states for N = 30. The gray boxes are the diﬀerent values of δ for a scale parameter

computed with formula (17). They all ensure a value of δ lower than 1 %.

FIG. 3: Comparison between the potential computed from the 1S wave function (19) thanks to the

Lagrange mesh formula (11), and the exact Coulomb potential given by Eq. (18). The potential has

been computed with N = 30 (circles) and N = 100 (crosses) mesh points, but only a few points are

plotted for clarity. The regularized wave function is also plotted with an arbitrary normalization

(dashed line). We used µ = 0.70 GeV and κ = 0.27. For N = 30, it can be computed that

h = 1.3 GeV−1 and δ = 1.4 10−5 %; for N = 100, we have h = 0.37 GeV−1 and δ = 0.7 %.

FIG. 4: Comparison between the equivalent local potential (circles) computed from the wave

function (24) with E =

2.225 MeV and the exact equivalent local potential (solid line) given by

−

Eq. (26). The regularized wave function is also plotted with an arbitrary normalization (dashed

line). We used α = 0.046 GeV, β = 0.274 GeV, and N = 30. Following formula (28), h =

1.8 GeV−1.

FIG. 5: Comparison between the potential computed from the 1S wave function (31) with a

semirelativistic kinematics (circles) and the exact harmonic potential (solid line) given by Eq. (34).

The regularized wave function is also plotted with an arbitrary normalization (dashed line). We

used N = 30, and (Ω/2)1/3h = 0.034 from Eq. (33).

FIG. 6: Complete curves giving the potential computed from the 1S wave function (31) with a

semirelativistic kinematics for several choices of h and N . These choices ensure more or less the

same mesh point density. The potential is only known at the mesh points (symbols), and the exact

harmonic potential is plotted with a solid line.

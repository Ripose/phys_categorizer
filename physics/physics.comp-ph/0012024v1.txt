Abstract

Reciprocal space methods for solving Poisson’s equation for ﬁnite charge
distributions are investigated. Improvements to previous proposals are pre-
sented, and their performance is compared in the context of a real-space den-
sity functional theory code. Two basic methodologies are followed: calcula-
tion of correction terms, and imposition of a cut-oﬀ to the Coulomb potential.
We conclude that these methods can be safely applied to ﬁnite or aperiodic
systems with a reasonable control of speed and accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION

Density-functional theory1,2 in its time-dependent3 as well as ground or time-independent
forms has proved to be an eﬃcient method for treating electron-electron interactions and
has been applied successfully to ﬁnite systems such as clusters,4 to bulk systems or surfaces,
and to aperiodic systems such as defects.5 However, the high computational cost of treating
large systems places a practical limit on the size of systems that can be studied.

The use of pseudopotentials6,7 enhances the performance of this sort of calculation by
avoiding an explicit treatment of the Kohn-Sham orbitals associated with the core. Further-
more, the smoothness of the resulting valence pseudowavefunctions allows the use of a plane
wave basis for describing them, and consequently also the electronic density. A plane wave
basis is particularly attractive because it allows use of the fast fourier transform (FFT), for
rapid and memory eﬃcient transformations.

A discrete but truncated set of plane waves based on the reciprocal lattice is one natural
basis set for a periodic system. However, for ﬁnite systems, or more generally, for systems
lacking periodicity such as defects in solids, the use of a discrete set of plane waves will
generate periodic images of the ﬁnite cell to be studied. In the case of a ﬁnite system this
leads to a problem in the calculation of the electrostatic potential due to the electrons, the
so-called Hartree potential, due to the long range of the Coulomb interaction. Nevertheless,
discrete plane wave basis sets are often used for ﬁnite systems because of the great eﬃciency
of the FFT, and errors in the Hartree potential due to periodic images are usually ignored,
or reduced by increasing the size of the supercell. These spurious eﬀects might seriously
aﬀect the calculated equilibrium structure and dynamics of weakly bounded molecules or
clusters, eg. water. However, several methods have been proposed recently for treating this
problem.8–13

Our purpose here is to compare four methods for solving Poisson’s equation for ﬁnite
systems. One of them is an iterative, real-space method based on ﬁnite diﬀerences and
conjugate-gradients minimization, which obviously doesn’t suﬀer from the problems related
to periodic images. The other three use discrete plane wave basis sets and FFT’s, but treat
the cell-to-cell interactions in diﬀerent ways. Two of these plane wave methods impose
a cut-oﬀ to the Coulomb interaction in real space, and have been described elsewhere.11
However, for one of these, which uses what we term a cubic cut-oﬀ, we have found signiﬁcant
improvements which we believe will be of interest to practitioners. The third plane wave
method has been developed and tested by us, but we have found a close relationship between
it and the local moment countercharge (LMCC) method proposed by Schultz,12 and also to
the Fourier analysis with long range forces (FALR) method of Lauritsch and Reinhard.8
However, our scheme is formulated more generally, and allows for better control of errors.

In order to compare the performance of the diﬀerent methods we have studied some
exactly soluble model systems, and NaCl and Na+2
10 molecules which, because of their polar
or charged nature, are diﬃcult to treat with plane wave methods. Of particular interest
is the way the computational time scales with system size. Although all the plane wave
methods scale as a few times N log N, where N is the number of real-space mesh points, the
proportionality factor varies substantially from method to method. We shall compare the
speed and memory requirements of the methods, and how these scale with the size of the
systems.

2

The plane wave schemes we discuss are intended mainly to deal with neutral or charged
molecules or clusters in free space and could be implemented directly in existing ab initio
plane wave or real-space codes, but they could also be used in those LCAO basis set codes
which base the calculation of the Hartree potential on the FFT. General subroutines for
calculating the Hartree potential using these methods are available upon request from the
authors or can be downloaded from the web page.14

Short theoretical descriptions of the plane wave methods are given in section II where
we emphasize the improvements we have developed. Section III presents and compares
the results for the Hartree potential calculated using the diﬀerent methods, and concluding
remarks are made in the ﬁnal section. Atomic units are used unless otherwise stated.

The solution of Poisson’s equation,

2VH + 4πn = 0, which goes to zero at inﬁnity, for

a charge density n, localized within a cell C of volume Ω, is given by

∇

(1)

(2)

Within the cell n and VH may be expressed as Fourier series: n(r) = Ω−1

eiGr˜n(G)

Z

where ˜n(G) =

drn(r)e−iGr, and similarly for VH, and where the G vectors are reciprocal
vectors of the lattice formed by repeating the cell C. If the Fourier coeﬃcients, ˜n(G), are
negligible for G larger than some cut-oﬀ so that the sums over G may be truncated, then the
˜n(G) and the n(r) points are related through a discrete Fourier transform. This amounts
to approximating the integral over the cell in the deﬁnition of ˜n(G) by the trapezium rule,
a point to which we shall return later. However, n(r) given by the Fourier sum is periodic
so that the straightforward substitution into Eq. (1) gives a potential:

G

V [n, r] =

˜n(G)
G2 eiGr,

G6=0

which diﬀers from VH. But the merit of V is that it can be calculated using the the very
eﬃcient FFT with its NlogN scaling, and so we now modify or apply corrections to Eq. (2)
so that it can be used to obtain VH. Two aspects of V given by Eq. (2) require attention.

•

The G = 0 component in Eq. (2) is arbitrarily set to zero. For a charged system, this
corresponds physically to introducing a uniform compensating charge background, b,
so that the system is electrically neutral. For a neutral system, this means that the
boundary condition, V (r
) = 0, is not satisﬁed (which, of course, also happens
in the charged case).

•

V is the potential due to the charge distribution n in the central cell plus that due to
the images of n

b in all other cells.

Since we are dealing with the electron charge distribution, there is obviously a net charge.
The fact that the whole system (cores + electrons) may or may not be charged, is irrelevant
for the discussion presented in this paper. However, it might be important if the calculations
are total-energy supercell calculations. In this case, the system of ion cores is also treated
using reciprocal space, so that a background of opposite sign has to be added.
If the
ﬁnite system is neutral, the eﬀect of the backgrounds cancels. The spurious eﬀect of higher
multipoles, however, will remain. The distinction is important, though, because the uniform
background introduces an important error in the total energy of order O(L−1), L being the
size of the cell, whereas the leading eﬀect of the presence of the multipoles is the dipole-dipole
term, behaving like O(L−3). This is shown in the calculations presented in next section.

B. Multipoles-corrections method

We can start to deal with the cell-to-cell interaction, by eliminating the eﬀects of net
charge. This can be done by subtracting from the original charge distribution, n, an auxiliary
charge distribution naux, so that no net charge remains. The potential VH then becomes:

VH[n] = VH[n

naux] + VH[naux].

−

The term VH[n

naux] can be treated using the FFT techniques, and then the correction
VH[naux], calculated explicitly in real space, added on. This method is especially convenient
if the Fourier components of naux can be calculated analytically, so that the expression
becomes:

−

VH[n]

V [n]

ψ,

≈

−

VH[naux] is a function
where V [n] follows the deﬁnition given in Eq. (2), and ψ = V [naux]
which can be calculated analytically. The sign
denotes that the eﬀect of higher multipoles
is still included. The choice of naux is arbitrary; it could be a uniform density, or a gaussian
centered on the origin, in both cases the function ψ can be calculated analytically.15

≈

−

This procedure can be easily generalized, to account for the interaction of higher multi-
poles. We merely need to add an auxiliary charge distribution which mimics the multipoles
whose eﬀect we want to subtract. This procedure is called by Shultz12 local moment counter-
charge method (LMCC). Shultz accounts for the monopole and dipole corrections through
a superposition of localized Gaussian charge distributions constructed to have the same net
charge and dipole moment. Higher multipoles can similarly be accounted for by the super-
position of additional Gaussian distributions, but the procedure becomes complicated. A
straightforward approach which is more easily generalized introduces an auxiliary charge
distribution in the form:

and Mlm is the multipole moment of n given by

Mlm =

drn(r)rlYlm(r).

Z

(7)

The width parameter a is to be chosen so that naux is negligible at the cell boundary. If
high order moments are required a could be taken to be l-dependent, decreasing somewhat
with l. Note that the l = 0 term in Eq. (5) corrects for the net charge as described above.
The auxiliary density is localized within a cell and has the same multipole moments as n.
We can now correct for the presence of the periodic images of n, and obtain for the required
Hartree potential in the central cell:

VH[n, r] = V [n, r]

The ﬁrst term in ψlm is the periodic potential due to nlm in every cell, and the second

term subtracts the eﬀect of nlm in the central cell. The function Il is:

The procedure for obtaining VH is to calculate and store the functions ψlm once and for
all for as many of the multipoles as are needed to achieve the desired precision, then for the
particular charge distribution V is calculated using FFTs, the Mlm are computed, and Eqs.
(8) and (9) used to obtain VH within the central cell apart from the constant shift.

The shift V0 is chosen so that the boundary condition VH (r

) = 0 is satisﬁed. This
we accomplish by computing the average value over the surface of the cell of the corrected
but unshifted potential VH obtained by simply putting V0 = 0 in Eq. (8). For a cubic cell

surface. As such, by Gauss’s theorem and symmetry, u is constant inside the cell and has
the value α/Ω1/3 with α = 1.586718 for a cube. If n integrates to z, then we have ﬁnally:

and V0 should be chosen so that VH has this value. The calculation of the correct shift to
satisfy the boundary condition requires the computation of the surface average of V , but
since the Kohn-Sham orbitals are unaﬀected by the addition of a constant to the potential,
this only needs to be performed at the end of a self-consistent cycle.17

VH =

C. Cut-oﬀ methods

We now review two established methods,9,11 based on imposing a cut-oﬀ on the Coulomb
interactions. They are exact, but need a bigger cell, which is a computational drawback as
we shall see.

Let us deﬁne a new cell D, which includes C. This new cell will deﬁne new coeﬃcients
GD, which are the reciprocal vectors of the lattice formed by repeating D. Retrieving Eq.
(2), we realize that the function V [n] can also be expressed as:

V [n, r] =

dr′n(p)(r′)

Z

1

,

|

where n(p) is the function formed by the sum of n and all its periodic repetitions in the
superlattice.

We now introduce a truncated Coulomb potential, with the following properties:

0 ,

for r and r′ both belonging to the same image of C.
for r and r′ belonging to diﬀerent images of C.

f (r

r′) =

It is easily seen that:

VH(r) =

where ˜f (G) =

drf (r)e−iGr.

Two choices for D and f have been given. One of them uses a spherical shape9 for the
cut-oﬀ of the Coulombic interaction, and the other a cubic shape,11 based on the assumption
that the original cell C is cubic itself.

1. Spherical cut-oﬀ method

Let LC be the length of the side of C. We will deﬁne a larger cubic cell of side LD =
(1 + √3)LC, centered on C. For this choice of D we deﬁne next the truncated Coulomb
interaction:

f (r

r′) =

0 ,

< √3Lc
> √3Lc.

Deﬁned in this way, f meets the required conditions expressed in Eq. (16), because any
two points belonging to C are always closer than √3LC, and any two points belonging to
diﬀerent images of C are always farther away than √3LC.

The Fourier transform of n has to be calculated numerically in the larger cell D; however

that of f is easily obtained analytically:

f

(G) = 4π

−

F {

G2

cos(G√3LC)

.

2. Cubic cut-oﬀ method

The former proposal is exact; but a very large cell is needed, which increases the time to
evaluate the FFTs. Reducing LD introduces spurious interactions and thus spoils the pre-
cision of the calculations, but if extremely precise calculation are not needed, a compromise
could be reached.

Our aim now is to reduce LD but maintain an accurate evaluation of VH. We take the

larger cell to have LD = 2LC and the cut-oﬀ Coulomb interaction to be:

f (r

r′) =

−

If r and r′ belong to C, r

r′ belongs to D. And if r and r′ belong to diﬀerent images

of C, then r

r′ will not belong to D. Thus again f is correctly deﬁned.

−

The Fourier transform of this function f has to be calculated numerically, and we face
here two drawbacks: the function has a singularity at the origin, and is not analytic at the
boundary.

Jarvis et al11 dealt with the ﬁrst problem by integrating and averaging the singularity
over a grid unit, which may not be adequate. The second problem appears to have been
overlooked. In any event, their treatment of the Mg atom using the cubic cut-oﬀ method
converges poorly compared with the results with the spherical cut-oﬀ, and they declare a
preference for the spherical cut-oﬀ despite the larger cell size required. However, we shall
show how to overcome these diﬃculties so that the cubic cutoﬀ method, to be preferred
because of its smaller cell size, can be used with great precision.

The singularity at r = r′ can be treated as follows:

e−iGr =

(23)

and the numerical integration reduces to the ﬁrst term, which is free of singularities. Even
so, this term cannot be calculated by simply applying an FFT because the repeated function,
although periodic, is not analytic at the boundary. Use of the FFT amounts to using the
trapezium rule for the integration, which is exact for a periodic analytic function, but leads
to substantial errors when there are discontinuous derivatives as we have in this case. We
evaluated the integral using a second-order Filon’s method,19 which proved to be eﬀective.
Other procedures18 (Simpson’s, Romberg’s...) could have been used - they are all rather slow
if accurate results are to be obtained, but this calculation needs to be done only once for a
cubic cell. If we denote by I[D(L)](n1, n2, n3) the integral in Eq. (22) for a cubic box of side L
and frequency indices (n1, n2, n3), it is clear that I[D(L)](n1, n2, n3) = L2I[D(1)](n1, n2, n3).

III. RESULTS

A. Exactly soluble systems

It is interesting to see the eﬀect of the various multipoles that a charge distribution
might have by using the multipoles-correction method on an exactly soluble system. We
have studied systems consisting of superpositions of Gaussian charge distributions placed at
various points Ri within the cubic cell of side L:

exp(

|r−Ri|2

)

.

n(r) =

X

(24)

We have investigated the eﬃciency with which the multipole corrections remove the
eﬀects of the images of the charge distributions in other cells. This has been done as
functions of L, as for a large enough cell the results for the periodic system should become
exact, but at rates depending on the order of the multipoles. The results are shown in Fig. 1
for the cases in which there are (i) no corrections (by which we mean that only the constant
to meet the proper boundary conditions is added to the raw potential obtained from the
Fourier transform), (ii) monopole corrections, (iii) monopole + dipole corrections, and (iv)
monopole + dipole + quadrupole corrections. The following points are noteworthy.

•

•

There is a serious, roughly 10%, error in the total energy when the Hartee potential is
uncorrected. Although this is not a consideration in superlattice calculations provided
the system is neutral, it is an important matter in real space calculations when the
Hartree potentials due to the electrons alone is calculated in reciprocal space.

The time for the calculations behaves roughly as O(L3logL), but with irregularities.
The eﬃciency of the FFT algorithm depends on the prime factorization of the number
of points to be transformed. The original FFT was developed for powers of two, but
now algorithms exist with more ﬂexibility.20,21 We have used the FFTW package,22
with support for all the primes involved in our calculations.

8

•

Adding the quadrupole corrections does not seem to improve the accuracy of the result,
nor is the L-dependence improved. This is because the interaction energy between the
dipole of the charge distribution in the central cell and octupoles in other cells, has
the same L-dependence and order of magnitude as the quadrupole-quadrupole energy.
Consequently, although the potential will be improved by adding to it the quadrupole
corrections, there could be no signiﬁcant improvement in the total energy if the system
has a strong dipole. In general, it can be shown that the error in the electrostatic energy
due to the presence of an l multipole in the charge distribution in the central cell, and
l′ multipoles in all other cells goes to zero like L−(l+l′+1), or in some special cases faster
due to symmetry (for instance, if l = 0 and l′
3, or l and l′ have diﬀerent parity).
Thus, adding octupole corrections to the potential will not change the L-dependence
of the total energy if the system is charged because of the interaction of the monopole
with the l = 4 multipole. Our calculations below on the Na+2
10 cluster provide an
interesting example of this behaviour.

≤

B. Real systems

We have performed several electronic structure calculations on real systems to assess the
performance of the methods. We have used a real-space code,24 in which a superlattice and
plane waves are only used to accelerate the solution of Poisson’s equation for the electron
charge distribution. In this type of approach a correction for the net charge is always needed
irregardless of whether the molecule or cluster itself is charged or neutral. Furthermore, in
this approach the value of the multipoles will depend on the position of the molecule with
respect to the centre of the cell. In order to minimize the multipole corrections the centre
of charge of the system of ions should be placed at the centre of the cell. If this is not done
in real space calculations the errors caused by cell-to-cell interactions could be magniﬁed.
In order to illustrate the eﬀects we take the center of charge as the cell center for one of our
test cases, and not for the other. As for other details of the calculations we used density-
functional theory with the local-density approximation for exchange and correlation, and
Troullier-Martins23 nonlocal, norm-conserving pseudopotentials.

Our ﬁrst choice for a realistic system was the NaCl molecule, also treated by Shultz12
and Jarvis et al,11 because of its strong dipole moment (experimental value of 9.0D in the
gas phase, as reported by Nelson et al.25) In this case, the center of charge of the system of
ions is placed at the center of the cell. The equilibrium bond-length was calculated: (i) using
the spherical cut-oﬀ method which is exact with a large enough cutoﬀ, and (ii) using the
multipoles correction and correcting only for the monopole term so as to show the inﬂuence
of the dipole-dipole interactions which are ignored. Our calculated “exact” value is 2.413˚A,
whereas the result ignoring the dipole-dipole interactions is 2.448˚A.

Next, we investigated the performance and accuracy of the methods by determining
the errors in the total energy and electric dipole moment, while monitoring the calculation
times. We compared results for the energy and dipole moment against those obtained with
the spherical cutoﬀ method with a cut-oﬀ radius of √3LC, grid parameter (0.2˚A) and cell
size (L=10˚A). In this way an electric dipole moment of 8.4551D was obtained. Each of
the four methods was then used to converge the electronic ground state of the molecule for
successive values of a “control parameter” for speed and accuracy:

9

•

•

•

•

For the real-space, conjugate-gradients method this parameter was the order of the
diﬀerence formula used to evaluate derivatives.

For the spherical cut-oﬀ method, we note that, if the electron density is well localized
within the C cell, the need for the full cut-oﬀ radius, √3LC, may be relaxed and
a correspondingly smaller D cell used, introducing some error but accrueing time
savings. We have investigated the eﬀect of using a reduced cut-oﬀ radius, rcut-oﬀ,
through a control parameter, α, which is the ratio of the D and C cubic cell edges:

α =

= 1 +

LD
LC

rcut-oﬀ
LC

(25)

so that α = 1 + √3 is the minimum value for which exact results are guaranteed.

The D cell size can also be reduced in the case of the cubic cut-oﬀ method, and the
control parameter is again α = LD

2 guarantees exact results.

LC where α

≥

For the multipoles correction method, the order of the multipoles corrected for is the
control parameter.

In Fig. 2 we illustrate the results obtained for each of the methods. Both cut-oﬀ methods
are presented in the same column as they use the same control parameter, although the
ranges of values are diﬀerent.

1. The real-space method is signiﬁcantly slower than the other methods for the same
accuracy, and a case can be made for using reciprocal space methods for calculating
the Hartree potential in what are otherwise real-space codes. However, enhancements
of the conjugate-gradients method are possible through preconditioning and multigrid
techniques.26,27

2. The cut-oﬀ methods reach acceptable accuracy much below the values for α which
guarantee exact results: 1 + √3 and 2 respectively, for the spherical and cubic cut-
oﬀ. This to be expected when the charge distribution is well localized within the cell.
However, it is clearly demonstrated that, for a given accuracy, the size of the auxiliary
cell is smaller for the cubic cut-oﬀ method, and as a result, the calculation time is also
shorter.

3. The multipoles-correction method already gives good accuracy if the dipole interac-
10−5eV error in the energy, and 10−4D error in the electric
tions are corrected for (5
dipole). Without the dipole correction, the error in the energy is 0.085eV, and in
the dipole is 0.17D, which give an indication of the size of errors to be expected when
supercell calculations are performed for neutral molecules and no corrections are made.

×

We have also performed calculations on the Na+2

10 cluster containing the same number
of valence electrons as the NaCl molecule. Results are similar to those presented for NaCl,
but some diﬀerences should be reported. In this case the center of charge was not placed
at the center of the cell, consequently, although the cluster has a calculated net dipole of

10

4.5D, the electronic dipole responsible for the errors is a much larger 10.2D. The cluster
was positioned in the cell so that the charge density occupied most of the cell, allowing an
optimally small cell. As a result, to achieve similar accuracy as for the NaCl molecule, we
should expect the need for (i) larger cut-oﬀ lengths for the cut-oﬀ methods, and (ii) higher
multipole corrections.

In Fig. 3 we show the error in the energy obtained by using the multipoles correction
method. It can be seen how the inclusion of the dipole correction yields a much less satis-
factory error in the energy than for NaCl. Furthermore, for the reasons given earlier, the
removal of the quadrupole-quadrupole, dipole-octupole, and octupole-octupole terms does
not signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy. Only by including all corrections to the potential up
to fourth order multipole moments do we obtain a comparable result for the energy. The
calculation time, which is also shown in the ﬁgure, is beginning to increase sharply by fourth
order as further corrections are added.

In Fig. 4 we present, as well, the results for the error in the total energy and the calcu-
lation time for the cubic-cutoﬀ method. Comparison with Fig. 2 conﬁrms that the energy
converges much less rapidly as a function of α than for the NaCl molecule.

IV. CONCLUSIONS.

We have studied some of the methods which have been proposed recently for solving
Poisson’s equation in reciprocal space for electronic structure calculations on ﬁnite systems.
We also propose a method based on multipole corrections. Test calculations have been
performed to assess the performance of the methods. We conclude that reciprocal-space
methods can be accurate enough for ﬁnite or aperiodic systems, and their eﬃciency is a
signiﬁcant improvement over that of real-space methods. Two basic reciprocal-space meth-
ods have been investigated: one which imposes a cut-oﬀ on the Coulomb potential, and
one based on the removal of the spurious eﬀects through a multipole expansion. Both yield
satisfactory results, and comparable eﬃciency.

The former approach has been already been surveyed by Jarvis et al

.11 There are two
possibilities for the cut-oﬀ function, one, the spherical cut-oﬀ, was highlighted for having
superior convergence with the plane wave cut-oﬀ of the reciprocal lattice. However, we
have identiﬁed and corrected problems with the other possibility, the cubic cut-oﬀ, which
eliminates the poor behaviour, and makes this cut-oﬀ method the better of the two because
smaller FFT’s are allowed.

The method based on multipoles corrections was initiated by Shultz,12 but we have
developed a scheme which we think is more general. Its performance is more predictable
than that of the cut-oﬀ methods, which are sensitive to the choice of the cut-oﬀ length. The
reason for the sensitivity is that the cut-oﬀ length determines the size of a larger auxiliary
cell and the number of grid points over which FFT calculations are performed, and the
FFT is sensitive to the prime number decomposition of the number of points. On the other
hand, the speed and accuracy of our “multipoles correction” method, are adequate for most
applications, and can be easily controlled by choosing the order of corrections applied.

All the methods have been presented assuming a cubic cell. However, generalizations
to other cell shapes are possible if the geometry of the system requires it. The multipoles
correction method is immediately applicable to any cell. Clearly the spherical cut-oﬀ method

11

would be ineﬃcient for elongated cells because the radius of the cut-oﬀ sphere is determined
by the longest dimension of the cell. But, the cubic cut-oﬀ method can easily be generalized
to other cell shapes, at the cost of more, and more lengthy calculations of the Fourier
transforms of the truncated Coulomb interaction.

We have made a simple implementation of the solvers within the self-consistent frame-
work, but smarter algorithms can be developed, since not all the iterations of a self-consistent
calculation need be done with the same accuracy. For example, signiﬁcant improvements
in eﬃciency can be gained if, for a given method, the iterations are started with a fast but
inexact solver through appropriate choice of the control parameter, but improved as self-
consistency is approached. Moreover, methods could be combined using, for instance, the
real-space method for the last few iterations because of its eﬃciency when a good starting
point is known.

16 Although a cubic cell is used for simplicity, extension to a rectangular parallelpiped is
possible. This could be important for molecular dynamics simulation with variable cell
shape.

17 In fact, some numerical diﬃculties arise when calculating this constant. A better approach
is splitting the function into periodic and aperiodic parts, and performing the integration
only for the periodic part, which should integrate to zero.

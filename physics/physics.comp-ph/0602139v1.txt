Abstract. We present a review of the quantum three-body problem, with emphasis
on the diﬀerent methodologies, diﬀerent three-body atomic systems and their historical
interest. With the review as the background, a more recently proposed non-variational,
kinetic energy operator approach to the solution of quantum three-body problem
is presented, based on the utilization of symmetries intrinsic to the kinetic energy
operator, i.e., the three-body Laplacian operator with the respective masses. Through
a four-step reduction process, the nine dimensional problem is reduced to a one
dimensional coupled system of ordinary diﬀerential equations, amenable to accurate
numerical solution as an inﬁnite-dimensional algebraic eigenvalue problem. A key
observation in this reduction process is that in the functional subspace of the kinetic
energy operator where all the rotational degrees of freedom have been projected out,
there is an intrinsic symmetry which can be made explicit through the introduction of
Jacobi-spherical coordinates. A numerical scheme is presented whereby the Coulomb
matrix elements are calculated to a high degree of accuracy with minimal eﬀort, and
the truncation of the linear equations is carried out through a systematic procedure.
The resulting matrix equations are solved through an iteration process. Numerical

. Up to thirteen-signiﬁcant-ﬁgure accuracy is achieved for the ground
state eigenvalues when double precision programming is used. Comparison with the
variational and other approaches shows our ground state eigenvalues to be comparable,
generally with less decimal digits than the variational results, but can yield highly
accurate wavefunctions as by-products. Results on low-lying excited states and their
wavefunctions are obtained simultaneously with the ground state properties, some
at accuracies not achieved by other methods.
In particular, for the doubly excited
and the 1,3P e states of helium, some results are obtained for the
state 3P e of H
ﬁrst time. Also, we have calculated fourteen H+
2 excited states, up to its dissociation
level. Analysis of the wavefunction characteristics, especially in relation to the electron-
electron correlation eﬀects, are presented. A signiﬁcant advantage of the kinetic energy
operator approach is its general applicability to diﬀerent three-body systems, with only
the charges, masses, and the symmetry of the desired state as the required inputs.
Potential applications of the present approach to scattering and other problems are
noted.

1. Introduction

The dynamics of three interacting bodies constitutes one of the oldest challenges in
physics. Studies in this ﬁeld can be traced back to the work of Euler in the 18th century.
In the beginning of the 20th century, the failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization
to correctly describe the ground state of helium has stimulated the development of the
“new” quantum theory, formulated by Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg. Almost 100 years
after the founding of modern quantum mechanics, there is still a continuing eﬀort to
improve the solution methods or to invent new approaches for the seemingly simple
three-body Coulomb system.

In the early calculations of the two-electron systems, the focus was usually on the
bound-state spectra, with the helium and helium-like ions as the proving ground. The
spectra could be calculated eﬃciently with the help of the Hartree-Fock self-consistent-
ﬁeld method based on the variational principle. Very high accuracy can be achieved
for eigenvalues such that they may be compared with high precision measurements.
Bether and Salpeter [1] have summarized the early works in this area. The more recent
calculations of the bound states have extended such routines with new numerical schemes
and judicious choices of basis functions.

In a seminal experiment by Madden and Codding [2], the discovery of strong
electron-electron correlation eﬀects in doubly excited resonance states of helium has
triggered the development of group-theoretical and adiabatic quantum approximations
to understand these eﬀects. The two-electron dynamics were again at the forefront of a
revival. As doubly excited resonant states could not be tracked by an eﬀective single-
particle method, over the past four decades the eﬀort to understand doubly excited
resonances has stimulated much of the theoretical research on two-electron atoms. The

CONTENTS

4

role of electron correlation has become more important with increasing order of double
excitations, and the correlated three-body Coulomb dynamics have been found to cause
an extremely rich and complicated resonance spectrum. Hence two-electron atoms have
come to represent a prototype of the few-body systems strongly aﬀected by electronic
correlation.

A more diﬃcult problem is the three-body scattering, such as hydrogen-electron
scattering. This problem has attracted much attention recently. By using the ﬁnite
element method, Levin and Shertzer [3] analyzed the S-wave phase shifts for low-
energy positron-hydrogen scattering. Botero and Shertzer [4] directly solved the
Schr¨odinger equation for electron-hydrogen scattering, and Rescigno et al
[5] and
Baertschy et al
[6] used supercomputers to obtain a complete numerical solution of
the hydrogen atom ionization through electron collision.

Three-body systems, especially the two-electron systems, remain an active ﬁeld of
research today. This persistent interest can be traced to the fact that the three-body
problem is just complex enough for rather sophisticated theoretical concepts, yet simple
enough to provide accurate numerical and experimental tests.

More recently, Hsiang and Hsiang [7, 8, 9, 10] have outlined a new approach to the
quantum three-body problem which was based on the systematic exploitation of all the
intrinsic dynamic symmetries of the three-body kinetic energy operator (the three-body
Laplacian with the respective masses), some of which not fully recognized previously.
The purposes of this work are to implement this new mathematical formulation and
to compare the present approach with the conventional variational approach in terms
of numerical results for both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a number of quantum
three-body systems.

The main conclusions of this work are that the present approach oﬀers not only
systematic computability, requiring minimal ad hoc inputs in the computational process,
but also achieves numerical accuracy for both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The
In particular, the wave
latter advantage is particularly signiﬁcant for excited states.
function characteristics of excited states with strong electron-electron correlation can
be accurately delineated.

In what follows, we ﬁrst review the various approaches to the quantum three-body
problem in section 2, followed by a detailed presentation of the kinetic energy operator
approach in section 3. The formulation essentially consists of a four-step reduction
process, in which the dynamic symmetries intrinsic to the kinetic energy operator are
fully utilized. The end result of the reduction is a one-dimensional coupled system of
ordinary diﬀerential equations, solvable as an inﬁnite-dimensional algebraic eigenvalue
problem. In section 4, a scheme is presented for the numerical implementation of our
approach. Due to the high precision required for the Coulomb matrix elements, a special
integration technique is used to evaluate both the matrix elements as well as the product
of the potential energy matrix with a vector. A sparse matrix solver is then applied to
solve the linear equations iteratively. Truncation of the inﬁnite linear system is carried
out by following a rule implied by the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues, leading

CONTENTS

to sequences of numerical data from which one can apply a systematic extrapolation
procedure. The results for some typical Coulomb systems are presented in section 5,
with comparisons to those obtained via other approaches. We also explore the properties
of three-body wave functions, and discuss some of their physical signiﬁcances. It should
be noted that all the results were obtained by using the same program. Inputs are the
symmetry of the state (i.e., S, P , D, or F ), the mass ratios, and the sign of the charges.
The article concludes by noting some potential applications of the present approach.

2. Review of the various approaches

2.1. Variational method

Quantum variational method is most suitable for obtaining accurate results for the
ground state or low-lying states, and in this regard it is superior to the perturbation
methods. The basic idea of the variational method, sometime also denoted as the Ritz
variational method, named after the pioneer of the approach, is to write the trial wave
function Ψtr in some arbitrarily chosen mathematical form with variational parameters,

Ψtr = Ψtr(α, β, γ,

),

and then adjust the parameters to obtain the minimum energy

It should be noted that the trial wave function(s) must satisfy the symmetry condition
imposed by the Fermi-Dirac statistics. The solution to (3) yields minima of energy in
the multidimensional parameter space. The lowest energy minimum is treated as the
approximate ground state eigenvalue. As an example, a simple trial wave function for
the ground state of helium-like atoms is ψ(r1, r2, r12) = exp(
σ)(r1 + r2)), where σ

the appearance of the subsidiary condition that the eigenfunction of every excited state
must be orthogonal to the eigenfunctions of all the lower-order states. This condition
reduces considerably the number of available trial functions which may be chosen to
approximate the eigenfunction (to be inserted in the variation integral) of the particular
excited state. As a result, convergence is not nearly as good.

Historically, Kellner [11] was the ﬁrst to use the variational principle to obtain a
rather precise ground state energy, E=-2.895 a.u.. His results were improved upon by
the variational calculations of Hylleraas [12, 13], who obtained E=-2.9037 a.u. using
a trial wave function with 38 variational parameters. This method was later used by
Kinoshita [14] in large-scale variational calculations. In a bold move, Frankowski and
Pekeris [15] used more than 200 parameters in trial functions to obtain the energies
of helium-like systems that were not surpassed for almost two decades. With the
appearance of powerful modern computers, however, people can now include more
than one thousand parameters in trial wave functions in order to obtain high accuracy
results for the ground state of helium, hydrogen-like ions and some muonic molecular
ions [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

As a modiﬁed version of the variational method, the complex rotation method,
based on the dilatation analytic continuation [22, 23, 24], was extensively used to
calculate the doubly excited states of the two-electron systems [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. The
reiθ, is applied to the radial coordinate,
basic idea is that after a complex rotation, r
the resulting Hamiltonian becomes complex, i.e., H(θ) = e−2iθT + e−iθV , where T is the
kinetic energy operator and V the Coulomb potential. The complex Hamiltonian will
yield complex eigenenergies as a result of applying the Ritz variation, in which the real
part would correspond to the position of the doubly excited state, and the imaginary
part its life-time.

2.2. Hyperspherical coordinates method

Hyperspherical coordinates were ﬁrst introduced into atomic physics by Gronwall [30]
to study the analytic structure of the Schr¨odinger equation for the ground state of
helium atom. The basic idea of the hyperspherical approach to the three-body systems
is to express the two relative (to center of mass) coordinates as a single six-dimensional
vector, and the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation in the six-dimensional space is to
be solved without reference to the “wave functions” associated with individual particles.
The condition of particle exchange symmetry then becomes a boundary condition on
the three-body wave function on the hypersurface.

The hyperspherical approach has been applied to solve bound states and scattering
problems in many diﬀerent ﬁelds of physics and chemistry. Many of the earlier
works dealt with the basic structure of the mathematical functions encountered in
hyperspherical coordinates. Here we introduce the hyperspherical coordinates for two-
electron atomic systems such as helium and hydrogen negative ions where the mass of
the nucleus is treated as inﬁnite. The hyperspherical coordinates are then obtained by

where ρ is the hyperradius which measures the size of the system, and α is the
hyperangle. Thus the two vectors r1 and r2 are replaced by six coordinates (ρ, Ω),
where Ω = (α, θ1, φ1, θ2, φ2) denotes collectively the ﬁve angles, with (θi, ψi) being the
spherical angles of electron i. In hyperspherical coordinates the two-electron equation

The straightforward solution approach is to expand ψ(ρ, Ω) by the eigenfunctions
of Λ2, called hyperspherical harmonics. This method has been applied by a number of
authors to H− and He systems [31, 32, 33, 34], but the rate of convergence is rather
slow. To improve the rate of convergence, Haftel and Mandelzweig [35, 36, 37, 38, 39]
introduced an exponential factor in the expansion, ψ = χΦ, where χ is chosen to be
of the form χ = exp
, with a and b to be obtained variationally or
by some ansatz. If a and b are appropriately chosen, the singularity in the Coulomb
potential can be removed, and it is then possible to expand Φ in terms of hyperspherical
harmonics with rapid convergence. Another common approach, the adiabatic expansion,
was introduced by Fano and ﬁrst applied by Macek [41]. Details of this method can be
found in the review article by Fano [43] and a relevant book [44].

2.3. Perturbation, Hartree-Fock, and the ﬁnite element methods

In the perturbation method, the Hamiltonian is split into two parts, H = H0 + λH1,
where the perturbation term λH1 is small in a relative sense. For the Hamiltonian
equation

the eigenfunction Ψ and eigenvalue E are expanded in powers of the small parameter
λ, namely

Substitution of these expansions into the Schr¨odinger equation and equating the
coeﬃcients for each power of λ to zero lead to an inﬁnite set of coupled linear equations:

For the calculation of E2, E3,
, more eﬀorts are needed. There is no theorem to
clearly tell one how to choose the perturbation λH1, and there can be diﬀerent choices
for the same problem. For large Z in helium-like ions, the interaction 1/r12 between
the electrons can be treated as the perturbation; for the excited state, there is the
unsymmetrical choice [1], H0 = T + V1 + V2 and λH1 = W , where

where the + sign in the above equation is used when the spin state has antisymmetry.
The form of the trial wave functions ψ1(r) or ψ2(r) is unknown, but the aim is to ﬁnd the
most accurate form possible for the two functions ψ1(r) or ψ2(r) that would minimize the
expectation value of the Hamiltonian, which is regarded as a functional of the two trial
wave functions. The application of the general variational principle leads to two coupled
diﬀerential-integral equations (the Euler-Lagrange equations). In essence, the Hartree-
Fock method is a mean-ﬁeld theory.
It diﬀers from the Ritz variational approach in
that the variation in the Ritz method is carried out by using parameters, whereas in the
Hartree-Fock method the variation is carried out by solving coupled integral-diﬀerential
equations.

Recently, the ﬁnite element method (FEM) [45] has been used to directly solve the
Schr¨odinger equation, especially for the S state of some systems. The domain of the
wave function is segmented into tetrahedrons, each serving as the domain of a local
polynomial basis set. The approximation of the wave function as a linear combination
of these local polynomials is called a ﬁnite-element description. FEM treatment for
the helium atom in the inﬁnite nuclear mass approximation [46, 47, 48, 49, 50], and
the hydrogen molecular ion H+
2 in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, have been
presented by several authors [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]. An adaptable FEM approach was
used by Ackermann [57] and co-workers to obtain the energy values to a precision of
10−11 with moderate computational eﬀort. The advantage of FEM lies in its ﬂexibility
because of the local basis, but the drawback is that one often has to face huge sparse
matrices.

In a three-body Coulomb system, the position vectors and the masses of the three
particles are denoted by rj and Mj, j = 1, 2, 3. The relative masses are deﬁned as mj =
Mj/M, where M is the total mass, M =
mj = 1. Schr¨odinger equation is

the six parameters,
. The Coulomb potential depends only on
the distance between each pair of particles, and the system is invariant under spatial
translation, rotation, and inversion. Furthermore, if the system consists of identical
particles,
invariance with respect to the permutation of identical particles must be
imposed.

3.1. Overview of the approach

As implied by the name, the focus of the present approach is on the kinetic energy
operator ∆. Before delving into the details, it would be helpful to give an overview
In the ﬁrst
of the formulation, which in essence consists of four reduction steps.

step (section 3.2), we reduce the nine dimensional problem to a six dimensional problem
by simply using coordinates relative to the center of mass. Jacobi vectors will be
introduced at this stage to facilitate later developments. In the second step (section 3.3),
angular momentum eigenfunctions will be presented which are in the null space of
the kinetic energy operator. That is, when the angular momentum eigenfunctions
are operated on by the kinetic energy operator, the result is zero. Thus when the
total wave function is expanded in terms of the angular momentum eigenfunctions,
the coeﬃcients of the expansion, which are rotationally invariant, satisfy a reduced
Schr¨odinger equation which is three-dimensional. The set of functions that satisfy this
reduced Schr¨odinger equation constitutes a subspace in which all the rotational degrees
of freedom have been projected out. In the third step of the reduction (section 3.4),
this 3D reduced Schr¨odinger equation is expressed in terms of the Jacobi-spherical
coordinates, leading to a form with an angular operator whose eigenfunctions are the
Jacobi polynomials (hence the denotation of Jacobi-spherical coordinate). It should be
emphasized that the Jacobi-spherical symmetry is particular only to the kinetic energy
operator and not to the Coulomb potential, in contrast to the rotational symmetry.
Hence the total Hamiltonian does not have this symmetry. However, the Coulomb
potential becomes separable in the Jacobi-spherical coordinates. That is, the Coulomb
potential can be expressed as a product of two terms, one of which depends only on the
radial coordinate of the Jacobi-spherical coordinates. The wave functions of this reduced
Schr¨odinger equation can therefore be expanded in terms of the Jacobi polynomials with
coeﬃcients depending only on the radial coordinate of the Jacobi-spherical coordinates.
In the fourth and last reduction step (section 3.5), the substitution of the this expansion
into the reduced Schr¨odinger equation leads to a set of coupled ordinary diﬀerential
equations (ODEs) which is now only one dimensional, i.e., the solution depends only
on the radial coordinate. The solution to the set of ODEs can be expanded in terms of
the Laguerre polynomials, and the coeﬃcients of this expansion satisfy an inﬁnite linear
system which is amenable to numerical solution (section 3.6).

3.2. Jacobi vectors and coordinate transformations

The conﬁguration space of a given three-body system is a nine-dimensional space
consisting of a triplet of position vectors,

9 =

ℜ

r1, r2, r3}

{

,

where rj is the position vector of j-th particle. Without the loss of generality, one can
assume that the center of gravity is ﬁxed at the origin, thus reducing the conﬁguration
space to the following six-dimensional reduced conﬁguration space:

by deﬁning the inner product as

This deﬁnition is related to the Lagrange’s least-action principle, which was reformulated
by Jacobi, leading to the geometric explanation of mechanics. The metric ds2 is deﬁned
in terms of the kinetic energy T by setting

explanation: trajectories of a given mechanical system are exactly those geodesic curves
in the metric space of ds2, deﬁned in the conﬁguration space.

3.2.2. Jacobi spherical coordinates The Hamiltonian of the three-body problem (Lapla-
cian plus Coulomb potential) has space-rotation symmetry, but the symmetry of the
kinetic energy operator is higher than that of the potential energy (Coulomb interac-
tion). Moreover, there is a direct relation between the kinetic energy operator and
the kinetic metric ds2.
It is obvious that (f1, f2, f3) is not orthogonal; hence terms
do not vanish in ds2. By making use of the following coordinate

It is thus obvious that there is a semi-spherical structure in ds2, which implies some
form of symmetry of the kinetic energy operator, beyond those associated with rotational

3.3. Symmetries and angular momentum eigenfunctions

1 + L2

Schr¨odinger equation is invariant under the spatial rotation and coordinate inversion.
That means both the total angular momentum operator L2(= L2
its
z-direction component L3, and the parity operator commute with the Hamiltonian,
(l, m), where m
therefore one has the angular momentum quantum numbers
characterizes the azimuthal component of the angular momentum, plus the parity
quantum number λ = 0, 1 for even and odd parities, respectively.
In addition, the
wavefunctions must also satisfy the Fermi-Dirac statistics, manifest as antisymmetry
under the exchange of two electrons. It should be noted that since the antisymmetry
applies to the product of spin state with the wavefunction, hence the wavefunction can
be either symmetric (for antisymmetric spin state) or antisymmetric (for symmetric spin
state).

2 + L2

3),

In this section, we use a set of bi-harmonic functions as the eigenfunctions of L2
and L3, and expand the wave functions in these basis functions so as to separate out
the rotational degrees of freedom from the Schr¨odinger equation.

The system is independent of the choice of z-direction, hence it is enough to consider
m(r) = rlY l
l
the special case, m = l. As is well known,
m(θ, φ), where the set (r, θ, φ)
denotes the spherical coordinates of a vector, is a homogeneous polynomial of degree
l with respect to the components of r, and satisﬁes the Laplace equation.
It is the
l−q
m′ (y) can
eigenfunction for the angular momentum operator. The polynomials
be combined to form the eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum L2 (L = Lx+Ly)
by the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients [58]. For the special case, m = l, one has two types
of bi-homogeneous functions [8, 9] with respect to x and y:

introduction of the Jacobi polynomials as the eigenfunctions of the angular diﬀerential
operator, hence the denotation of Jacobi-spherical coordinates.
It should be noted
that the Jacobi-spherical coordinate has been used by Simonov [59] and Whitten [60],
the latter used it to study the expression of pair potential. Mandelzweig and co-
workers [61, 62, 63] have also used this coordinate system to calculate some properties of
the Coulomb system. In the present case, the Jacobi-spherical coordinates are applied
to the reduced Schr¨odinger equation for the three-body system. As such, it oﬀers a
natural coordinate system to delineate the intrinsic symmetry of the reduced three-
body kinetic energy operator. We ﬁrst note some physical interpretation and properties
of this coordinate system.

(i) The variable ρ = √I, where I =

j is the moment of inertia in the center-
of-mass frame, thus ρ provides a natural measurement of the “size” of the system.

(ii) For the three sets of Jacobi coordinate vectors of (36), there are three simple

relations among them:

β(1) = β(2)

where ρ and ξ are unchanged, and β is shifted. This property has been used to
express rij.

3.5. Further reduction to a system of 1D ODEs

The “space-rotation reduction” enables us to completely remove the three rotational
degrees of freedom, and reduce the Schr¨odinger equation to a system of PDEs solely
in terms of the rotationally invariant parameters (f1, f2, f3).
In terms of the Jacobi-
spherical coordinates (ρ, ξ, β), the above reduced system of PDEs becomes well-
organized, in the sense that there can again be a separation of the angular component
with the radial component. The angular component consists of the sum of A(l+λ) and
the integral multiples B1 and B2. The complete solutions of the eigen-functions of A(l)
, can be explicitly obtained,
in terms of the Jacobi polynomials, namely
as well as analytic formulas of the matrices of the linear diﬀerential operators B1 and
B2 with respect to the above eigen-basis of A(l). Furthermore, we provide a way of
computing the matrix of U (ξ, β), which constitutes a separable part of the Coulomb
potential. By combining all the above results, it is straightforward to further reduce the
system of PDEs in (ρ, ξ, β) to an inﬁnite system of ODEs in terms of ρ. By writing

the components, and let

At this point it should be noted that while the starting point of the three-body

Multiplying the above equations by kx and then making use of the recurrence relations
of the Laguerre polynomials, we get the systems of linear relations in terms of the

4. Numerical scheme

Schr¨odinger equation for the Coulomb three-body system has been reduced from a nine
dimensional problem to a one dimensional problem and ﬁnally to a linear algebraic
problem in section 3. Here we present a numerical scheme designed to solve the relevant
linear equations. The core of the scheme is the iterative solution of the matrix-eigenvalue
problem. The advantage of the iteration procedure is that it only requires the matrix-
vector product, which can signiﬁcantly facilitate the numerical calculations due to the
sparse-block structure of the matrices in our problem. The general linear eigenvalue
problem is written into a standard form, and by applying a special integration rule,
presented in Appendix B, the calculation of the potential energy (Coulomb interaction)

matrix elements and the product of that matrix with a vector are combined together, to
achieve a high degree of numerical accuracy with minimal computational resources. In
present numerical calculations, the aim is to solve a system of sparse linear equations,
and an iteration solver is adopted for that purpose. Since truncation is necessary, an
extrapolation procedure is applied to accelerate the convergence.

4.1. Solution of the linear eigenvalue problem

After introducing the Jacobi polynomials, the system of PDEs is reduced to a system of
ODEs, and the ODE system is further reduced to a linear eigenvalue problem through
expansion in terms of the Laguerre polynomials.
In the block-matrix notations, the
linear algebraic equation can be expressed as

increasingly larger cases. This process fully takes the
advantage of the previous results, and signiﬁcantly speeds up the calculation. It also
provides a sequence of data from which one can apply the extrapolation procedure (see

4.2.1. Truncation path We have carefully checked the dependence of E on the three
numbers M, N and P . In our procedure, we chose a “path” in the
space
to approach the limit E∞. First, it was found that for suﬃciently large P (typically
P
70), increase in P does not provide any signiﬁcant improvement on E. This
behavior owes to the fact that P controls how many terms in the Laguerre polynomials
are included in the expansion, but there is a direct relation between the spatial extend
of the system and the spherical variable ρ, so for large enough P the terms of Laguerre
polynomials in the expansion are suﬃcient to delineate the spatial domain. Diﬀerent
states have diﬀerent “appropriate” P values, and after that value is determined, denoted
P0, the following “path” in
space is taken:

M, N, P

M, N

}

{

{

}

M = M0 + 20K, N = N0 + 10K, K = 0, 1,

(132)

,

· · ·

where M0 and N0 are the initial truncations for m and n, generally in the range of 70
and 50, respectively. The three-dimensional sequence E(M, N, P ) is thus mapped to a
one-dimensional sequence:

E(K) = E(M0 + 20K, N0 + 10K, P0).

There is a reason why we increase M twice as fast as N. It is known that the eigenvalues
of operator A(l) have the form

λ(l)
m,n =

− (

 

4n

1 +

+ m + n

+ m(l + m + 2)

.

!

)

l
2

As m and n approach inﬁnity, λ(l)

m,n has the asymptotic form

λ(l)
m,n ∝ −

(m + 2n)2,

so that the stipulated sequence is designed to coincide with this asymptotic behavior.

The task is to identify the leading term xa. Sequences of E(k) (E(x)) are collected in the
numerical calculations. The leading term is identiﬁed by studying the relation of E(x)
versus xat, where at is an estimated value of a. If the plot is a straight line, the leading
term can be immediately identiﬁed. The process of Richardson extrapolation [66] is
to estimate the limiting value E∞.

5. Results on three-body systems

In this section we present results on some three-body systems, and discuss the properties
of their relevant wave functions. In order to display the data in physical space, we ﬁrst
give a description of the relevant angles, as well as the procedure by which the wave
functions are re-constituted from numerical data.

5.1. Euler angles and wave functions

5.1.1. Euler angles and the distribution function The three-body wave function
depends upon the shape of the triangle formed by three particles and the three Euler
angles [58], such that

Ψ = Ψ(

; Ω),

where
represents the triangle which can be described by the three spherical variables
(ρ, ξ, β), or its three edges (r1, r2, r3), or (r2, r3, cos θ) as shown in ﬁgure 1, and Ω denotes
the Euler angles that depict the rotational orientation of the triangle in space. Here
r2 and r3 denote the distances of particles 2 and 3 from particle 1, respectively, and r1
denotes the distance between the two identical particles 2 and 3. The cos θ is between
particles 2 and 3 (the identical pair). For a six-dimensional function, visualization is
an issue. The Euler angles are noted to take part in the wave function through the
angular momentum eigenfunctions, but do not enter in the rotation-invariant functions,
which indicates that in order to deal with the Euler angles, we just need to focus on the
angular momentum eigenfunctions
. After the Euler angles
are integrated out from the wave function, a three-variable probability distribution

If there are two identical particles in the three-body system, we identify them as particles

5.2. Negative hydrogen ion

The negative hydrogen ion H− is an interesting special case of helium-like ions (Z=1).
It is marginally stable against dissociation into a neutral hydrogen atom plus a free
electron. The dissociation energy J of H− ground state is only about 0.75eV and this
ion possesses no other bound state [67, 68].

The negative hydrogen ion has been found to be of great importance for the opacity
of sun’s atmosphere. The ionization potential of H−, J
0.75eV , corresponding to
about 8700◦ K, is only slightly higher than the temperature for the solar atmosphere.
As free electrons are released by the ionization of the metal elements present in the
gas, and since neutral hydrogen is by far the main constituent of the solar atmosphere,
many of these electrons will be captured to form an abundant source of H−. The
radiation ﬂux coming from the sun’s interior would be absorbed by the H− ions,
accompanied by their dissociation. The electrons released can again be captured by
H− atoms with the emission of radiation, and so on. The process H− ⇀↽ H + e− is the

main source of observed opacity in the solar atmosphere. The absorption coeﬃcient of
H− has been studied extensively and used in the theory of the solar atmosphere. In
fact, discrepancies between early calculations and observational evidence on the sun’s
radiation have pointed out the inaccuracies of the calculated H− wave functions available
then. Calculation of the wave function and energy of H− is also of purely methodological
interest, since this most loosely-bound of all Helium-like ions provides a severe test for
the various approximation schemes.

5.2.1. The ground state Bethe was the ﬁrst to give an unambiguous proof of this ion as
a bound system [69]. Using the Hylleraas variational wave functions, Bethe concluded
that the resulting Rayleigh-Ritz upper bound on the energy lies below -0.5 a.u.. In 1944,
Chandrasekhar introduced a two-parameter trial wave function,

Ψ = exp(

and showed that the energy minimum at α = 1.03925 and β = 0.28309 is suﬃcient
to provide binding for H−. The function shown in (151) exhibits the speciﬁc nature of
electron-electron correlation in the ground state. The two electrons are on very diﬀerent
footings, one bound much closer to the nucleus than the other, which is weakly held

In modern variational calculations,

compared with other calculations. In general, all our results have 10
ﬁgures when double precision programming is used. The accuracy in this case is less
than those obtained variationally. It is well known that the precision of the operator
expectation values in the variational calculations usually has two less signiﬁcant ﬁgures
than that for the energy. Thus much more eﬀorts is required to obtain the wave function
expectation values to the same accuracy. In our case the wave function is calculated at
the same time as the eigenvalues. No extra eﬀort is required.

ﬁgure 3, the electron distribution of ∞H− is seen to be very diﬀerent from the neutral
1s or 2s state. Thus the electron-electron correlation plays an important role in H−,
and independent-electron model can not give an accurate picture.

5.2.2. The 3P e state The even-parity 3P e state of ∞H− and H− is quasi-stable, and
its energy is just below the n=2 threshold (-0.125 a.u.) of the hydrogen atom. For
the ∞H− ion, the existence of the even-parity 3P e state was predicted computationally
nearly 40 years ago, followed by many variational calculations. J´auregui and Bunge [71]
used a conﬁguration-interaction(CI)-expansion of 108 conﬁguration terms and obtained
the energy -0.125 354 716 6 a.u.. They analyzed the convergence pattern of their
computations and extrapolated to -0.125 355 08(10) a.u.. The largest Hylleraas-type
computation for this state, done by Drake and then repeated by [73] gave only -0.125
335 6 a.u., though they used about 50 thousand terms containing powers of r1 up to 82.
The best result, as we know, was obtained by Bylicki and Bednarz [72] who applied the
Hyllerass conﬁguration-interaction correlated expansions and used 1442 terms to give
-0.125 355 451 24 a.u.. More eﬀorts are needed than that for the ground state. In our
approach, this problem is reconsidered from a new viewpoint, and the ﬁnite mass of
proton is naturally taken into account.

We compare our results with other calculations in table 2. The convergence is just
as good in this case as for the ground state, and the leading term of all the sequences
is estimated to be x5. Our energy eigenvalue is 0.125 355 451 242 a.u. for ∞H−, better
than most of previous calculations.

As a negative ion, the extra electron is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the other electron.
Figure 4 shows the distribution of r1, r2, r3 and cos θ of the ∞H−. The radial distribution
has a very long tail; even at r = 60 the probability does not vanish. If the electron-
electron interaction is ignored so as to approximate this state by two 2p-state electrons,
the charge distribution of the 2p state would to vanish at about r = 15 (see ﬁgure 5),
very far from r = 60. This long tail exponentially decays with a decay length l
18.3,
with a form ra exp (
0.5. In this case, the independent-electron picture is
very far removed from the present excited state. The variational method is observed to
be less accurate for this state due to the very strong electron-electron correlation. For
some of the expectation values, such as < ri >, comparable results can not be found
in the literature. To our knowledge, our calculated result on this state is probably the
most accurate so far.

5.3. Helium and helium-like ions

Except for the hydrogen atom, helium atom (or helium-like ions) is perhaps the simplest
system in quantum mechanics. However, the calculation of its properties is not trivial
and represents a real challenge. It has been 80 years since the beginning of quantum
mechanics, and there are still eﬀorts trying to understand the system from some new
perspectives.

In atomic theory, the shell model is the starting point to understand complex atoms.
This model is an independent-electron picture, and the interaction between electrons
are averaged by a mean ﬁeld. For helium, we denote one of the electrons as the inner-
electron, and the other as the outer-electron. But when the correlation of two electrons
is strong, this picture fails. For example, in the shell model language the two electrons
in the ground state are in the same orbit. Interaction would thus become important,
which would make the independent-electron picture not suitable. For the doubly excited
states in which both electrons are not in the ground state, interaction can aﬀect the
slow-moving electrons very signiﬁcantly.

5.3.1. The S states of helium These states have been extensively studied, and there
are many methods used to treat the S states. For extrapolation, we estimate the leading
term of E(x) (for all of the S states) to be x3, and a list of the limiting values are given
in table 3 after performing the Richardson extrapolation. Except for the ground state
1Se, the other states are close to the independent-electron picture. In tables 5 and 6,
some of expectation values are given for the 1,3Se states of ∞He.

5.3.2. The odd parity P states The leading term of E(x) of all of these states is
estimated to be x2. Table 4 shows the convergence for the three low-lying 1,3P o states
of ∞He.

5.3.3. The parity-unfavorable 1,3P e, 1,3Do, 1,3F e states The doubly excited states 1,3P e
and 1,3Do have been observed in experiments long ago. Dolye et al
[77] calculated the
positions of the 1,3P e and 1,3Do states of the helium isoelectronic sequence using the 1/Z
expansion method. By using a variational scheme Bhatia [74] had calculated the 1,3Do
states of helium again and obtained a few higher-precision results. The best results for
the states of helium were obtained by Goodson et al
[78], who took the advantage of
the interdimensional degeneracies of the problem and used the variational method in
the ﬁve-dimensional space to obtain the results. The observation of the 1,3F e states is
rarely reported, and its energies had been computed by Gal´an and Bunge [79]. In this
subsection, we report the energies re-calculated by our approach.

For the 1,3P e states, we compare our results with other calculations in table 9. As a
non-variational method, the performance of our approach is excellent. The distributions

of r1, r2, r3 and cos θ are shown in ﬁgure 6 for ∞He. Some properties of these states
are given in tables 7 and 8. It should be mentioned that only in the case of E2 of the
1P e state is our result higher in energy than the variational approach, but has more
signiﬁcant ﬁgures. We think that in this case our result is correct, because our excited
states’ eigen-energies and their related wavefunctions were all obtained simultaneously
with the ground state properties. Hence the accuracy of our excited states’ properties
are insured by the demonstrated accuracy of the ground state eigenvalue. For helium-like
ions (Z = 3

6), the eigen-energies are summarized in table 10.

We have also calculated four low-lying 1,3Do states of ∞He. We compare our results
with Bathia’s in table 11. The three low-lying states 1F e states of Li+ ion are given in
table 12. It is seen that our results are better than those obtained by other methods.

5.4. H+

2 and Ps−

In order to obtain a better understanding of the underlying dynamical property of the
Coulomb three-body system with two identical particles, three typical systems are the
most interesting: (1) where the mass ratio m1 is large compared to m2, m3 in the
identical particles pair, e.g., for a helium atom or a helium-like ion (such as the H−
ion), (2) where m1 = m2 = m3 for a positronium negative ion Ps−, and (3) where m1 is
very small, e.g., for a hydrogen molecular ion H+
2 . It should be noted that the case of
hydrogen molecular ion is very close to a one-body system in which the single electron
moves in the ﬁeld of two heavy protons.

this ion, the most achieved so far, and the numerical results are summarized in table 13.

Ψ = Ψ(X, Y, R).

(152)

Here R is the distance between the two protons, and X, Y denote the coordinate of
the electron relative to the two protons. Figure 8 shows the distribution of R for the
calculated states. It is obvious that there is vibrational motion between the two protons,
similar to an anharmonic oscillator. In this case the attraction between the two protons
Ψ(X, Y, R)
is clearly mediated by the electron. Figures 9 and 10 show the function

of the ground state when R = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0. It is clear from these pictures that
the electron probability density is the highest directly above each of the protons, with
a sharp cusp at the proton locations.

5.4.2. The positronium negative ion Ps− The experimental and theoretical studies of
the positronium negative ion Ps−, consisting of two electrons and one positron, have
attracted considerable interest since the work of Wheeler [84], who proved Ps− to be

stable against dissociation into a free electron and a positronium atom. The formation
of Ps− has been discussed in the e+
H [86] scattering calculations. The
He [85] and Ps
binding energy has been calculated variationally by several authors. Recent interests
include the calculations of autoionizing doubly-excited states and the investigations
of the possible existence of the so-called second bound state 3P e. These positronium
negative ions have been observed in the laboratory by Mills [87, 88]. A large number of
the doubly-excited states of a positronium negative ion were calculated by the method
of complex-coordinate rotations [89].

−

We compare our results with other calculations in table 14. Figure 11 shows the
distributions for r1, r2 (or r3) and cos θ between the two electrons. It is seen that the
two electrons plus the positron form a triangle in which the angle formed by r2 and
r3 is greater than 60 degrees, consistent with the fact that the separation between the
two electrons is larger than their respective distances to the positron.
It should be
noted that the curve of the cos θ distribution is very diﬀerent from that of the ∞H− (see
ﬁgure 2). Since the only diﬀerence between the two systems lies in the mass of the
positive charge, the comparison is useful to delineate the importance of mass ratio. In

the present case, the mass of the positive charge is the same as that of the electron, so
the positron is envisioned to be much more mobile, whereas in the case of H− the proton
is more localized. This comparison is perhaps helpful in answering the question [90]: Is
the positronium system a molecule or an atom?

6. Further developments

The kinetic energy operator approach is noted to have applications potential for a
number of interesting problems. The approach is obviously applicable to the three-
body problem in two dimensions. The addition of a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld plus
a circularly symmetric potential is noted to be possible in this case, without breaking
the symmetry that is essential to the solution approach. Thus it would be particularly
interesting to examine the interaction of three electrons under a strong magnetic ﬁeld,
a conﬁguration which might be relevant to a fractional quantum Hall state.

The fact that we can reduce the dimensionality of the three-body problem also
promises numerical eﬃciency in the case of three-body scattering, which requires very
extensive computational resources at present [5]. There is also the possibility of carrying
out time-dependent calculations, with implications to the enumeration of doubly excited

Appendix B. IMT Integration Scheme

Consider the real value function f (x) deﬁned on the interval [ 0, 1], which is continuous
and diﬀerentiable suﬃciently many times on [ 0, 1]. For the N-point trapezoidal rule,
there is the Euler-Maclaurin formula

where Br is the r-th Bernoulli number and Rm is the reminder term. Noting that the
expression for the truncation error depends only on values of the functional derivatives
at the integration end points, we design a change of variable, so that

f (2r−1)(1) = f (2r−1)(0)

for

r = 1, 2,

.

· · ·

(B.2)

It follows from (B.1) that all error terms will vanish, and high precision can be achieved.
The IMT-rule [95, 96], also denoted the “double-exponential formula”, is one type of
integration technique. Consider

If the function f (x) is diﬀerentiable inﬁnitely many times on (0, 1) and has an algebraic
singularity such as xα or (1
1), then the function g(t) also can be
diﬀerentiable many times and all its derivatives vanish at the two ends of the interval
[ 0, 1] due to the strong singularity of ϕ′(t), so that

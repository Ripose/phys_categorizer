In this paper, we extend the conventional plane wave expansion method in 3D anisotropic photonic
crystal to be able to calculate the complex k even if permittivity and permeability are complex
numbers or the functions of ω. There are some tricks in the derivation process, so we show the process
in detail. Besides, we also provide an example for testing and explaining, and we also compare the
results with the band structure derived from conventional plane wave expansion method, then we
ﬁnally ﬁnd that there is a good consistency between them.

Recently,

the researches of the properties of the
photonic crystals (PCs) have aroused great interests,
since the concept of the PCs has been proposed by
Yablonovitch and John[1, 2, 3]. Brieﬂy speaking, PCs
are periodically structured electromagnetic media, gen-
erally processing photonic band gap (PBG). Most of the
studies stress the PBG structures with the use of conven-
tional plane-wave expanded (PWE) method[4, 5]. How-
ever, there are still many articles explore the inﬂuence of
interface, such as the studies of transmission, reﬂection,
and the penetration depth etc.[6, 7, 8, 9] Furthermore,
the penetration depth relates to the imaginary part of
wave vector. As for the complex k calculation in 2D
isotropic photonic crystals, we had suﬃciently discussed
about it in the last paper[13]. Now, this paper is to con-
tinue with the last one. Furthermore, the emphasis of
this paper is put on the general formula, 3D anisotropic
case, of extended plane wave expansion (EPWE) method.
Though the main part of the idea resembles in 2D
isotropic case[13], the formula and derivative process are
much more complicated than that in 2D isotropic case,
because the basis of wave functions can not be treated as
scalar functions, TE and TM modes in 2D isotropic case.
However, the problem of the diﬃcult part has been over-
come and we will explain it in the following description.
Besides, the eigenfunctions set derived from this EPWE

method is completely the same as that derived from the
conventional PWE method. So we have no qualms about
the inaccuracy of the propagation modes between these
two methods.

The system we discussed is periodically structured
without charge ρ and current J. Therefore, according to
Maxwell Equation, the magnetic ﬁeld H(r) should obey

Now, let us expand Eq.(1) directly through ˆx,ˆy and ˆz

Therefore, the treatment of ˆx component will be dif-
ferent from ˆy and ˆz components. The following is the
detail derivation process:

First of all, the ˆy and ˆz components of Eq.(2) can be

written as a matrix formula

... ˆB2

... ˆC1

ˆB1

... ˆC2(cid:21) (cid:18)

and its expansion type is

... ˆC2(cid:19) (cid:18)

HG⊥
˜HG⊥ (cid:19)

= kx ˆA

(cid:18)

˜HG⊥
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

,

(3)

where ˆA, ˆB1, ˆB2, ˆC1, ˆC2 are 2N ×2N , 2N ×N , 2N ×2N ,
2N × N and 2N × 2N matrices and their elements will
be illustrated in Appendix.

As regards the ˆx component of Eq.(2), we can write in
another form which is diﬀerent from ˆy and ˆz components
of Eq.(2). Thus the matrix form of Eq.(2a) is

where ǫij and µij are the abbreviations of ˆǫG−G′,i,j and
ˆµG−G′,i,j, and Hi is the abbreviation of HG′,i. When
k is provided, Eq.(2) becomes an eigenvalue problem in
which the eigenvalue is ω and is the conventional PWE
method. Now, there comes up an interesting question
that is whether k must be a vector of which the com-
ponents are real numbers. The answer is ”No”, and we
just need to do some modiﬁcation on Eq.(2) to get the
complex k, because Eq.(2) is a 4 variables (k and ω)
equation.

In the beginning, two important things need dis-
cussing. First, the inner product of (k + G) and Eq.(2)
results in

(ki + Gi)µG−G′,i,jHG′,j = 0

XG′,i,j
i,j=x,y,z

which are the restriction functions of which the amount
is N , meanwhile, N is the amount of {G} set. Therefore,
the certain amount of the independent eigenfunctions in
Eq.(2) is 2N not 3N . That’s why we will get the fake
eigenvalues which are ω2 = 0 if Eq.(2) is calculated as an
eigenvalue equation directly.

To avoid this situation occurring in our method, the

eigenvector we selected in our method is

, where HG⊥ and HG are

where ˆD, ˆE1, ˆE2 are N × 2N , N × N , N × 2N and their
elements are also in Appendix.

, ˜HG⊥ and ˜HG are kxHG⊥ and kxHG, re-

From Eq.(4) we obtain

Second, there are no k2

xHG′,i , i = x, y, z, and kxHG′,x
in Eq.(2a), which is the ˆx component of Eq.(1), because
the inner products of Eq.(1) and ˆx will cause the exis-
tence of just one kx or even no, and (k + G′) × HG′ part
will restrict the existence of kxHG,x.

a is not located in band gap, so such
kind of condition should also appeared in our method

FIG. 1: The schematic view of a cubic unit cell in which three
GaAs square rods cross together from the ˆx, ˆy and ˆz direction.
The lattice constant, width of square rods and ǫ of GaAs are
a, 0.4a and 11.43ǫ0, respectively.

For testing this method, we use an Intel centrino 1.4G,
512 MB RAM with matlab code published on mathworks
website to run an isotropic simple cubic case in which
the GaAs square rods — their widths are 0.4a, and a
is the lattice constant — cross together from ˆx,ˆy and ˆz
direction in the vacuum. In this system the permittivity
ǫ of GaAs and vacuum are 11.43ǫ0 and ǫ0, alternatively,
and the permeability µ is µ0 everywhere. You can see
its structure in Fig.(1) and calculation results in Fig.(2).
We spent about 6 hours on getting Figs.(2b) and (2c)
when using 729 {G} and taking 17 ky points from 0 to
π
a to accomplish the calculation. As regards Fig.(2a), it
is the band structure which is derived from Eq.(2) and
used to compare with our method. In Fig.(2a), we can

FIG. 2: The numerical results of Fig.1.
(a) is the band
structure derived from Eq.(2) and in which the bold line
is the ω = 0.2 2πc
(b) and (c) are the equal fre-
a
quency contour line of propagation modes in k space and the
min(| Im(kx)| 6= 0) vs. ky ﬁgure, alternatively. The circle in
(b) denotes the incident light of which ω = 0.2 2πc
a . Both of
them are derived from Eq.(6) when ω = 0.2 2πc
a , kz = 0 and
ky is scanned from − π
a to π
a .

Besides, we can ﬁnd that there are two propagation
modes toward right when ky is a ﬁxed number in Fig.(2b).
These modes are similar to TE and TM modes in 2D
isotropic PC, however, they can not be distinguished in
3D PC, we just plot them directly. Furthermore, C1
4 sym-

G

„
metry exists in Fig.(2b) but not in the ﬁgure of real part
of complex kx. The reason is the real number solutions
of kx are the kx of the propagation modes which are the
solutions of bulk system in which the C1
4 symmetry exist.
However, the above is not correct when kx are complex
numbers, because the complex means that there is an in-
terface destroying the C1
4 symmetry and facing ˆx direc-
tion in the system as well. Therefore, all the evanescent
modes of which kx are complex numbers just exist near
the interface and their penetration depths correspond to
2π/ |Im(kx) 6= 0| owing to eik·r = eikR·reikI
xx, where R
and I denote real and imaginary parts, alternatively. The
most remarkable one of the complex kx relates to the
longest penetration depth denoted as λLP D (ky, kz, ω),
because almost nothing but the propagation modes can
exist in this system when the distance from the detecting
position to the interface is larger than λLP D (ky, kz, ω).
Therefore, a semi-inﬁnite system can be treated as two in-
dividual regions: surface and bulk regions, all the evanes-
cent modes just exist in the surface region of which the
width is λS deﬁnded as max (λLP D (ky, kz, ω0)), where
ω0 is a ﬁxed frequency. For a ﬁnite size PC, if the ef-
fect of corner is not important, λS decides the smallest
size of PC. If the size is smaller than the smallest one,
the system no longer can be treated as a periodic struc-
tured media. Figure(2c) is the ﬁgure of a/λLP D vs. ky at
ω = 0.2 2πc
a . This ﬁgure indicates that the a/λLP D drops
to zero quickly when ky is located at the edge of contour
in Fig.(2b). This kind of situation arises while the state
located at the edge of contour changes from propagation
mode to evanescent mode. Besides, because |ky| ≤ 0.2 2π
a
when the incident light is a propagation mode in vac-
uum, we can ﬁnd that a/λLP D > 0.7. Therefore, the
longest penetration depth is a/0.7 for all incident light
perpendicular to ˆz direction.

In conclusion, because Eq.(6) is a kx eigenvalue equa-
tion when ω, ky and kz are provided, the ω can be a real
number at any time, and ǫ and µ can be the function of
ω, ky and kz or complex tensors. In addition, since most
of kx are complex numbers, the minimum of |Im(kx) 6= 0|
must exist, and this value will decide how large a PC is
able to treated as a single crystal if the inﬂuence of corner
is not important. Therefore, one of the issues we proceed
to research is the inﬂuence of corner. We thank Prof.
Ping Shen for his opinion to excite us to ﬁnd out the 3D
formula EPWE method.

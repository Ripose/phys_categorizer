Abstract

In previous papers [Phys. Rev. A 41, 4501 (1990), Phys. Rev. E 18, 3178
(1993)], simple equilibrium expressions were obtained for nonlinear Burnett
coeﬃcients. A preliminary calculation of a 32 particle Lennard-Jones ﬂuid
was presented in the previous paper. Now, suﬃcient resources have become
available to address the question of whether nonlinear Burnett coeﬃcients
are ﬁnite for soft spheres. The hard sphere case is known to have inﬁnite
nonlinear Burnett coeﬃcients (ie a nonanalytic constitutive relation) from
mode coupling theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

3

Ever since the Green-Kubo formalism for calculating the linear transport coeﬃcients
was developed, there has been interest in a corresponding theory for the nonlinear Burnett
coeﬃcients. The discovery of long-time tails in the velocity autocorrelation function by Alder
and Wainwright [1] indicated that the hydrodynamic transport coeﬃcients do not exist in
two dimensions, but do exist in three dimensions. By applying mode-coupling theories, Ernst
et al. [2] showed that the relation between stress and strain rate should be Pxy ∝ |γ| ln |γ|
for hard disks and Pxy = −ηγ + c|γ|
2 for hard spheres, which are non-analytic constitutive
relations. These results indicate that the nonlinear Burnett coeﬃcients do not exist at all,
so the interest has intensiﬁed for a numerical simulation to test the mode-coupling theories.
In a paper by Evans and Lynden-Bell [3], equilibrium ﬂuctuation expressions for inverse
Burnett coeﬃcients were derived for the colour conductivity problem. The coeﬃcients,
Bi, give a Taylor series representation of a nonlinear transport coeﬃcient L, in terms of
the thermodynamic force F . Thus if a thermodynamic ﬂux J is written in terms of the
coeﬃcient’s deﬁning constitutive relation as hJi = L(F )F , then the Burnett coeﬃcients are
related by L(F ) = B0 + B1F + B2F 2 + · · ·. In order to derive closed form expressions for the
Burnett coeﬃcients, it was found necessary to work in the Norton ensemble, in which the ﬂux
J, rather than the thermodynamic force F was the independent variable. The constitutive
relation in this case is hF i = L(J)J = B0 + B1J + · · ·. In the thermodynamic limit, we
may write L(J) = L−1(J), and so the non-linear Burnett coeﬃcients can be computed by
inverting the series.

Evans and Lynden-Bell [3] applied constant current dynamics to a canonical ensemble
with the currents distributed about an average current J0. This allowed the derivation of a
transient time correlation function for the non-equilibrium phase average hF i. It was then a
simple matter to compute the derivatives of hF i with respect to the average current J0, as the
constant current propagator commutes with the derivative operator. However, this method
appeared to be limited to colour currents, for which an appropriate canonical distribution
could be found. In a previous paper [4] we show that this method can be applied to the
situation of an arbitrary thermodynamic ﬂux. Later, [5] we showed that this transient time
correlation expression can be expressed in terms of an average over an equilibrium simulation,
reducing the calculation required by two orders of magnitude. At the time, computational
resources were not suﬃcient to establish whether this expression is ﬁnite in the limit as
t → ∞, or in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper, we present computational results of
colour conductivity in a Lennard-Jones system, harnessing 4 supercomputers simultaneously
over a period of 18 months, that show distinct evidence that B2 = ∞.

In order to avoid confusion, it should be noted that the term “colour diﬀusion” is some-
times used in the sense of the diﬀusion of colour labels attached to otherwise colour blind
particles in the complete absence of applied external ﬁelds [6]. In this approach if the colour
label attached to a particle is ignored, the system remains at equilibrium. This is manifestly
a linear process. In the model we consider all the particles interact with an external colour
sensitive external ﬁeld and this allows the possibility of a nonlinear response. It might also
be pointed out the the colour ﬁeld we consider here is independent of both position and time
so that the linear Burnett coeﬃcients do not play a role.

II. THE SIMULATION

The simulation was performed using the colour conductivity model described in Evans
and Lynden-Bell [3]. The intermolecular potential was taken to be the Lennard-Jones po-
tential, which has an attractive component due to van der Waals interaction, and a repulsive
hard core that goes as r−12:

V (r) = 4ε

In what follows, every quantity will be given in reduced units, in which ε = σ = m = 1.
This model has been well studied, and can be related physically to some noble gases like
argon.

The system was simulated at 3 diﬀerent system sizes (32, 108 and 256 particles) using
a periodic boundary condition to minimise boundary eﬀects. The state point chosen had a
temperature of 1.08 and density of 0.85. Considerable information was already known about
this system at that state point [8].

The equations of motion are just that of the Nos´e-Hoover thermostat, with an additional

ﬂux statting term. This generates a canonical ensemble:

where Fi are the intermolecular forces, ei = ±1 are the colour charges, T =

The feedback parameter Qλ was chosen equal to 4.74 for the 108, 256 and one of the 32
particle runs. Because Qλ should be an extensive quantity, the 32 particle run was repeated
at Qλ = 32 × 4.74/108 = 1.4. The Nos´e-Hoover thermostat parameter Qα was chosen to be
0.31N. The values of these parameters were chosen to give optimal convergence of the linear
response function. There is no real reason for them to be optimal for non-linear response
functions.

When the ﬂux is ﬁxed in this manner, the ensemble is termed a Norton ensemble. When
the thermodynamic force is ﬁxed, then it is termed a Th´evenin ensemble by analogy with
electrical circuits [8]. We have recently given a statistical mechanical proof of the macro-
scopic equivalence of the Norton and Th´evenin representations of a nonequilibrium system
[9].

Recall that Transient Time Correlation Functions for evaluating the inverse cubic Burnett

coeﬃcient B2 is given in Ref. [3]:

where λ(s) is the additional phase variable (deﬁned in eq. (1) corresponding to a colour
force of a system at time s along a trajectory and J is the colour current at the origin
of that trajectory. As the system is at equilibrium (in the canonical ensemble), after a
correlation time has passed, the system’s conﬁguration is eﬀectively randomised, and may
be used as a new trajectory origin. The correlations between diﬀerent successive states
of the equilibrium simulation can be easily seen by examining something like the velocity
autocorrelation function (see Fig 7.1 of [7] for examples). The correlation time for this
system is about 1.

III. RESULTS

Because the relevant quantity is an ensemble average, a very eﬀective parallelisation
strategy is to run a separate copy of the system on each processor, compute the TTCF on
each processor, then average over the entire set of processors, weighting for the number of
timesteps executed on each processor.

Having a set of approximations also allows one to calculate the standard error of the

TTCF. These are shown as error bars in Figures 2–9

Four parallel supercomputers were used in this experiment:

• 128 node CM5, jointly owned by the New South Wales Centre for Parallel Computing,
and the South Australian Centre for Parallel Computing, located at the University of
Adelaide;

• 1024 processor AP1000 owned by Fujitsu Parallel Laboratory in Kawasaki;

• 20 processor Power Challenge owned by the New South Wales Centre for Parallel
Computing, located at the Parallel computing and Visualisation Laboratory in Redfern
Sydney; and

• 12 processor Convex SPP2000 owned by the University of New South Wales.

Even though the parallelisation strategy is simple, use of a variety of architectures com-
plicated the project. The hand optimised assembler sparc code used in [5] was reused with
the AP1000, which is sparc-based, and the CM5 required hand coding the Forces routine
in CDPEAC, a low level language that allows direct access to the Vector Units, in order to
achieve reasonable performance. Both the Power Challenge and the Convex are SMP class
machines, and the original Fortran source code only needed minor tweaking for eﬃciency.
Table I lists the relative contributions that each system made to the ﬁnal result. Most im-
pact came from the older (and less user friendly) systems that had a lighter CPU utilisation.
Further details of this experiment have been reported in [10].

The TTCFs and their integrals are shown in ﬁgures 2..9. There is a considerable system
size dependence, indicating that the nonlinear Burnett coeﬃcients diverge in the thermo-
dynamic limit, although the individual TTCFs remain ﬁnite. It can be shown, using the
lemma proved in the appendix of [5], that the inverse nonlinear Burnett coeﬃcients given
by equation (2) should be intensive. As well as this, the 32 particle simulation shows strong
evidence of a long time tail (Fig 2 and 3) when Qλ is increased (softening the current-
statting), leading to a divergence in the integrals as t → ∞. For comparison, the transient

4

time correlation function for the linear coeﬃcient is shown in Fig. 1, showing convergence
within t = 5.

IV. CONCLUSION

This work presents strong numerical evidence in favour of inﬁnite nonlinear Burnett
coeﬃcients for soft spheres as is the case for hard spheres. However, the Taylor series
expansion of the constitutive relation presented in [4] can also be derived for J0 6= 0, which
if the hard sphere model is anything to go by, should be ﬁnite. These can be used to
compute the constitutive relation into the nonlinear region. However, it will probably be at
least another decade before these calculations become practical.

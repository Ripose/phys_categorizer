Elementary integration methods for waveguides are compared. One using non-local loading rules
based on Heaviside step functions, one using input side integration and one using integration of the
output of traveling velocity waves. We show that most approaches can be made consistent with
the wave equation in principle, under proper circumstances. Of all methods studied the Heaviside
method is the only method shown to not suﬀer from undesirable numerical diﬃculties and amendable
to standard waveguide loop ﬁltering practices, yet it gives incorrect results for Neumann boundary
conditions. We also discuss localized velocity excitations, time-limited input-side excitations and
the relation of loop ﬁlters to wave variable type.

INTRODUCTION

ized interpretation2,3.

The precise meaning of velocity excitations has
recently received renewed interest1,2. This interest
came out of comparative use of digital waveguide
synthesis3 and ﬁnite diﬀerencing methods4. This
comparison has revealed a number of related subtle
diﬃculties that weren’t overtly taken into account in
these comparisons. For details see1.

The current paper addresses excitation mecha-
nisms for the purpose of velocity excitations directly
and by example. While basic notions have long been
established3 deﬁned algorithms and functional prop-
erties haven’t been discussed yet.

Speciﬁcally comparisons and notions of equiva-
lence usually don’t discuss excitations and their spe-
ciﬁc implementations. Here we discuss three ba-
sic methods which relate to prior published non-
algorithmic suggestions and unpublished common
wisdom in the ﬁeld. Overall, published discussions
of integration algorithms in practice are rather rare.
Within the ﬁeld the two sources which are most ex-
plicit about velocity excitations to waveguides are
Smith3 (or comparable sources by the same author)
and Bank’s thesis5.

We will

in turn discuss the cases of the inﬁ-
nite string, the string with ﬁxed boundary condi-
tions, the string with open boundary conditions,
behavior with respect to loop ﬁlters, and compu-
tational cost for all three models. We will always
use the continuous case as comparative reference.
Then we will discuss interpretive issues with local-

INTEGRATION METHODS FOR THE

INFINITE STRING

Physically correct behaviors have been discussed
by the author1. Related examples have been derived,
some rederived, recently by Smith2 using a novel
state-space transformation13.

A. Heaviside Integration

There are two related ways to derive the following
algorithm. On is to consider a discretization of the
fundamental solution (equation (9) of the fundamen-
tal solution1). The other is to ﬁnd a discrete imple-
mentation of the continuous situation as described
by Smith, citing Morse3. The latter will assume an
arbitrary excitation distribution over which one can
integrate. The ﬁrst assumes impulsive excitations.
However any arbitrary excitation distribution can
be seen as the sum of time-shifted impulses, hence
these two are closely related.

The ﬁrst variant of the algorithm reads as follows:
Rescale the impulse3. Add the impulse to all taps
left of the excitation point to the right-going rail
of the waveguide. Subtract (or add with an inverted
sign) to all the taps left of the excitation point to the
left-going rail of the waveguide. Repeat for all ex-
citation positions and impulses at the current time-
step.

The second variant of

the algorithm reads:
Rescale the distribution3. Starting at the right-most
position of the string x = L, integrate rescaled exci-
tation distribution to position x and add the result

to the right-going rail and subtract the result from
the left-going rail.

point, we get the following result to an impulsive
excitation:

Using either of these algorithms we get for a
center excitation (compare with1,2, using Smith’s
notation2):

We see a peak at the excitation point that doesn’t
exist in the correct simulation discussed earlier
It’s called Bank’s
and the continuous simulation.
anomaly after Balazs Bank who was the ﬁrst to point
it out5. This anomaly speciﬁcally appears at the
point of excitation, which is exactly how Bank found
it. One can show that it also appears at the center-
symmetric position on the string due to constructive
interference. A non-linear hammer coupling needs to
know the local displacement. A question remains to
answered, which is whether the anomaly disappears
when the excitation is completed. But we see an
immediate way to resolve it. If the excitation point
is between spatial sampling points, the anomaly dis-
appears. Hence we cannot naively chose excitations
on the spatial sampling point without taking the
anomaly into account. See Bank for a number of
possible resolutions5. These yet lack a clear physi-
cal interpretation. Bank anomaly points at the diﬃ-
culty of spatial representation of excitation points, a
topic yet to be explored in detail. I will not attempt
to address it here.

To get the correct time-asymmetric pattern upon
inverting the direction of the reals, we need to invert
the signs of the excitation.

C. Output-side Integration

Finally

consider

“output-side
integration”14.
Here we integrate the sum of
rails carrying velocity waves to get one accumu-
lated displacement representation. The following

integration of the sum above it.

The upper two rows are right- and left-going
traveling-wave components. By convention, and fol-
lowing Smith2, the upper rail will move right and
the lower rail will move left. The bottom row is
their sum which is the total displacement. The lines
marks the excitation point.

If we observe that we get the correct picture1,2.
We can even revert the direction of propaga-
tion and get the correct time-asymmetric case of a
spreading square pulse with negative sign (compare1
(Eq. (47))).

As this solution comes about as the diﬀerence of
two Heaviside step-functions, I’ll call it the Heavi-
side integration method for waveguides for the un-
bounded string. We shall see that it readily extends
to the bounded case.

Hence this is one way of loading a waveguide that
is physically accurate (throughout this paper “phys-
ical” or “physically accurate” will mean, “compara-
ble results to the continuous solution of the wave
equation”).

B.

Input-side integration

Very few papers discuss velocity excitations ex-
plicitly. Bank5,6 is an exception. He employs what
I will call “input-side integration”. The idea is to
integrate a velocity input before feeding it into a
waveguide to arrive at a velocity excitation. A pro-
cedure that is suggested by the integral relationship
of the two3.

If we interpret the waveguide to be a spatial dis-
cretization of the string with both rails sharing the
same spatial position and we excite at this spatial

(9)

Hence we see that input-side and output-side inte-
grations behave comparably. Input-side integration
requires only one integrator whereas the output-side
case requires one for each spatial point. If a read-
out point is local, then this can however also reduced
to one integrator. We too see that Bank’s anomaly
persists for excitations on a spatial point. It can be
resolved by subtracting half the excitation from the
integrator at the excitation point at the moment of
excitation. The output-side integration also suﬀers
from the numerical weaknesses of non-leaky integra-
tors [Draft note: need discussion of leaky versus non-
leaky integrators. See3.]. In the input-side case this
problem is contained. This we will discuss when in-
troducing boundary conditions.

These two approaches have, however a crucial dif-
ference. The content of the traveling waves diﬀer
and hence in general the ﬁlters in the loop diﬀer if
they wants to achieve the same ﬁnal result15. After
all in one case the ﬁlter will see impulses as input
whereas in the other case it will be step functions16.

A number of hybrid approaches have been pro-
posed. I will not attempt to discuss them here, as
the goal is the understand velocity excitations in a
purely waveguide setting. See for example7,8,9.

III. EFFECT OF BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

Next we will introduce boundary conditions. This
raises another question. How do the respective
approaches to integration compare with respect to
boundary conditions.

First we refer to1 for the ground truth. The so-
lution is periodically extended at boundaries which
create mirror images of the solution (hence the name
“method of images” in the theory of partial diﬀer-
ential equations10). The image is so chosen as to
satisfy the boundary condition.

3

In the case of a string with ﬁxed ends (Dirich-
let boundary conditions) it is well-known that for
displacement waves the boundary inverts the sign,
hence the image is sign-inverted with respect to the
original. See Figure 3 in1 for a center excitation.
If the excitation is oﬀ-center we get a parallelogram
with maximum width less than the length of the
string. In either case there are three possible states:
unit positive, unit negative and zero extension. The
three states alternate with a zero extension state
always between diﬀerent sign unit extension ones.
[Draft note: Add ﬁgure for oﬀ-center case, compa-
rable to Figure 3 in1 to illustrate this.]

Also we observe that the transition between the
vanishing of negative to positive extension looks like
the discrete case illustrated in Eq. (47) of1 and hence
corresponds to the case also observed under time-
reversal for the Heaviside integration method.

In the case of a string with open ends (Neumann
boundary conditions) the displacement waves do not
invert sign at the boundary. Here we get a linear
accumulation with every reﬂection. The geometric
picture is the same as the Dirichlet case, except that
former zero extension states have even increasing ac-
cumulation, and the other states for odd increasing
accumulation. See also1 for a formal derivation of
this property.

IV.

INTEGRATION METHODS AND

DIRICHLET BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

Inverting boundary conditions should create the
right image of traveling waves. We will thus use
these conditions and observe the various methods.

These are the respective results of the Heaviside
Integrator for time steps equivalent to half a string
length. The diagram is as before except that ver-
tical lines at each side denote the boundary. The
excitation is at the midpoint:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Hence we see that the output-side integration
yields the correct pattern. The integration contin-
ues indeﬁnitely by deﬁnition. However compared
to the input-side integrator we observe, that non-
trivial addition (adding zero) in the integrator hap-
pen twice per period for one impulsive excitation,
whereas the integrator on the input side only needs
to store the impulse and hence has no further non-
trivial additions after its initial loading. This means
that under sparse input conditions, input-side inte-
gration is numerically favorable. More precisely, in
the worst case an output-side integrator will see in-
deﬁnite non-trivial additions at every time-step even
for excitations of a maximum length of twice the
string. Input-side integrators will see non-trivial ad-
ditions only at every time-step when the excitation
changes. If the excitation is indeﬁnitely non-trivial,
the two methods are comparable with respect to ad-
dition inaccuracies.

Output-side integration for lossless strings is im-
practical because any numerical error in the addition
will accumulate, though only linearly, as the error is
not fed back into the waveguide iteration.

Observe that the pattern repeats and matches the
continuous case. The oﬀ-center case can readily be
plugged in for similar results.

B.

Input-side Integration

The excitation is placed in the middle of the string
and constitutes loading the result of a non-leaky in-
tegrator fed by an impulse to equal parts left and
right of the excitation-point into the respective trav-
eling waves.

Observe that integration never stopped going
through the full period. However if integration is
stopped at any point the pattern will be inconsistent
with the continuous case. Also we see that after a
full period the integration still needs to continue, as
we have returned to the original state. Hence there
is no ﬁnite-length loading using the input-side exci-
tation method17. Again, oﬀ-center excitation follow
the same pattern without major diﬀerences.

Input-side integrators will feed numerical errors
into the string, yet again only linearly, as the content
of the waveguide is not feed back into the integrator.
This changes in case of non-linear coupling mech-

anisms and additional care must be taken.

V.

INTEGRATION METHODS AND

NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

Next we discuss integration methods for strings

with loose ends.

It is well known that this corresponds to reﬂec-
tions without sign inversion at the boundary for dis-
placement waves10,11.

A. Heaviside Integration

These are the respective results of the Heaviside
Integrator for time steps equivalent to half a string
length. The excitation is at the midpoint:

1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
-1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

-1 -1 -1 -1 1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1
1 1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 -1

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

Hence we see that the Heaviside Integration does
not yield the correct accumulation of displacement
as is seen in the continuous case1. Why this simula-
tion breaks down, remains to be explored.

B.

Input-side Integration

The excitation is placed in the middle of the string
and constitutes loading the result of a non-leaky in-
tegrator fed by an impulse to equal parts left and

right of the excitation-point into the respective trav-
eling waves.

Observe that integration never stopped going
through the full period and again needs to con-
tinue. We observe the correct accumulation of linear
displacement1.

(37)

Hence we see that the output-side integration
yields the correct pattern1. The integration contin-
ues indeﬁnitely by deﬁnition.

VI. DAMPING AND LOOP FILTERS

Finally I want to discuss the impact of ﬁlters,
in particular the most basic case of linear damp-
ing ﬁlters, corresponding to a gain multiplication in
the loop, on the schemes discussed.
It is easy to
see that the Heaviside integration method is well-
behaved with respect to such loop ﬁlter. All the
data is present and at least linear damping will dis-
sipate all information without trouble. The impact
of phase delay and its relationship to physically ob-
servable eﬀects on the waveform on the string is more
complicated and should be investigated separately.
The same in fact holds for non-integrating simula-
tion, where the exact relationship between phase de-
lay and physically correct wave form is usually phe-
nomenologically treated.

The output-side integration case is troubled by a
linear gain loop ﬁlter. Amplitude in the waveguide is
dissipated, but prior states in the output integrator
may still have older higher amplitudes. Hence sub-
tracting them will leave an incorrect remainder in
the integrator proportional to 1 − g where g is a pos-
itive gain factor less than 1. A potential solution is
to introduce a matched leak to the integrator. How-
ever, a precise match is critical to avoid numerical
inaccuracies.

The input-side integration case is diﬃcult to damp
with loop ﬁlters, as the integrator will indeﬁnitely
feed input into the loop. Hence the ﬁlters needs to
be matched at the input to avoid this problem.

Overall, of all the integration methods studied,
only the Heaviside integration method is numerically
well-behaved, and easily adaptable to loop ﬁlters as
customary in waveguide synthesis. However it can-
not be used for a Neumann simulation in its current
form. The other methods have to be handled with
care for they use non-leaky integrators, which are
numerically unstable.

VII. COMPUTATIONAL COST

The computational cost of the Heaviside integra-
tion method is dependent on the excitation position.

6

If the excitation position is at the far end of the
string the maximum integration length of twice the
string length L (once for the each rail) is reached.
If a choice of rail direction is permissible in the par-
ticular implementation, this can be reduced to one
string length as the positive rail is chosen to corre-
spond to the shorter side of the string. This inte-
gration has to be performed per impulsive velocity
excitation V . Hence we get an overall computational
complexity O(V · L) and if L is treated as a constant
O(V ). This is independent and in addition to the
complexity of the waveguide iteration. We denote
by O(W G) the complexity of the waveguide compu-
tation accumulated over time steps. Hence we get
the total complexity of max(O(V · L), O(W G).

The computational cost of input-side integration
is one non-trivial loading per time step of the waveg-
uide iteration. Additionally a constant amount of
operations are necessary for changes in the integra-
tor on non-trivial input. Hence the complexity is
max(O(V ), O(W G)).

The computational cost of output-side integration
depends on the spatial distribution of the integra-
tion. Typically only one observation point is of in-
terest. Then one integration per time step is nec-
essary, independent of the output. The complexity
is thus O(W G).
If the full length of the string is
required this becomes O(W G · L).

We observe that the local, output-side integration
is computationally most eﬃcient, while numerically
least desirable. The Heaviside integrator is never
cheaper than the input-side integrator, the extra
cost depending on the length of the string and the
position of the excitation. Yet this is bought at de-
sirable numerical properties and easy of use.

VIII. DIFFICULTIES WITH “LOCALIZED
VELOCITY INPUT”

It is a repeated belief that traveling velocity waves
can be calculated from displacement waves by cal-
culating their diﬀerence instead of their sum2,3. It
is considered a form of localized velocity excitation.
Diﬃculties with this belief has in essence already
been addressed by the author elsewhere1. Here I
would like to discuss this diﬃculty based on the
given examples.

Assume that one wants to simulate a local veloc-
ity impulse and it’s eﬀect on displacement. Using
the above prescription, one might implement the

following algorithm:

n,m = 1 and y−

no displacement in accordance with expectations for
a velocity excitation. However, as time evolves on
sees an isolated negative impulse traveling left and
an isolated positive impulse traveling right (see also
Eq. (45)1). However if we excite the lossless wave
equation with a velocity impulse, we get a diﬀerent
picture. We get a spreading square pulse1,2,11.

Clearly the simple use of the relationship between
displacement and velocity waves in waveguides gives
an incorrect result.

The interpretation of diﬀerence of displacement
waves can also be seen in the simulations provided
here. Observe equations (1-3).

We see that these pictures do not violate the naive
interpretation of the relation of velocity to displace-
ment waves. Indeed we have zero displacement ev-
erywhere and the data present make the displace-
ment zero by using the diﬀerence.

However, it does give us a clue as to the diﬃculty
in using the interpretation that lead us to the naive
approach in the ﬁrst place.
If we accept that the
diﬀerence between rails gives velocity, and we ob-
serve that a step function has been loaded into the
waveguide, we have to conclude that the waveguide
contains an semi-inﬁnitely extended velocity. Rather
than the string moving upward on the whole of the
semi-inﬁnite half-line, it starts to spread only from
the initial excitation point.

Clearly there is a diﬃculty in using the naive in-

terpretation.

Clearly the diﬀerence between the two traveling
wave rails cannot be velocity. There is another rea-
son for this, which is dimensionality. The sum and
the diﬀerence of two variable of the same dimension-
ality will stay of that dimensionality. The sum and
diﬀerence of displacement stays a displacement. So
one has to not only take the diﬀerence to get dis-
placement waves, one has to also integrate inertial
velocities to make sure they have the correct dimen-
sionality. This integration creates the step functions
that we observe above. This is indeed peculiar, as
step functions are non-zero out into inﬁnity, hence
are non-local. It has in fact been pointed out that
variables in waveguides in some constellations have
this non-local property7,8. The string, like any me-
chanical system, requires displacement and veloc-
ity for full speciﬁcation3 so we observe that one of
them has a non-local property when compared to
the other.

Hence “localized velocity excitations” should be

7

considered a displacement excitation in terms of
dimensionality of the quantities involved.
It also
shares the time-symmetric properties of displace-
ment excitations (see eq. (49) in1).

This indicates that one can in fact not so readily
go from displacement to velocity. One is non-local
to the other and the conversion is not only diﬀerence
but also integration or diﬀerentiation, see3.

IX. CONCLUSIONS

We discussed three integration method for velocity
excitations in displacement waveguide simulations.
They diﬀer in terms of numerical properties, rela-
tion to loop ﬁlters, computational cost and gener-
ality. For most situations the Heaviside integration
algorithm is most desirable, except for strings with
loose ends, when this methods is incorrect. Of the
remaining methods, input-side integration is gener-
ally more desirable, than output side integration, for
numerical reasons and for the impact on loop ﬁlters.
We also discussed the diﬃculties with localized ve-
locity excitations as diﬀerence of displacement waves
and the impact of the change of wave variables on
the loop ﬁlter in use.

Localized velocity excitations will generally yields
results diﬀerent from the wave equation. Loop ﬁlters
not designed with the integrating behavior of dis-
placement waves in mind, may inaccurately model
the desired behavior. Hence suﬃcient care must be
taken.

It is worthwhile to note, that the excitation al-
gorithms presented here don’t constitute a complete
excitation description with respect to the wave equa-
tion.
In general both displacement and velocity
waves are present at the same time and hence ex-
citations of the both types can occur in any linear
mixture1.

13 This transformation contains many interesting prop-
erties and is highly constructive and hence constitutes
a great recent contribution to the ﬁeld. For this reason
I suggest calling it the Smith transformation.

14 I’m unaware of this being explicitly introduced else-
where. If the reader knows of a prior reference, please
let me know.

15 Of course there is only one physically accurate result.
16 I am unaware of any publication that point to the
important of the choice of the wave variable to the
properties of loop ﬁlters, or alternatively speaks to
the relation of impulse response to damping read-out.
Again, if a reader knows a reference, please let me
know. I am aware that Smith discusses the somewhat
related issues of observability12.

17 This goes counter to the intuition that one might be
able to load the length of the string once only using
input-side integration, which is incorrect.

We apply the recent adaptive observer scheme introduced by Besan¸con et al (2004) to the three-

parameter free damped oscillator obtained in 1998 by Rosu and Reyes by factorization methods.

In order to do this, the scheme is applied in a nonstandard form in which a time-varying quan-

tity containing the unknown value of the Riccati parameter is estimated. Results of computer

simulations are presented to illustrate the good feasibility of the approach.

INTRODUCTION

In 1998, Rosu and Reyes used nonrelativistic supersymmetry to introduce a three-

parameter damped oscillator [1]. Their main work was to apply the one-parameter su-

persymmetric approach ﬁrst introduced in Physics by Mielnik [2] to the Newtonian damped

oscillator equation. Rosu and Reyes showed that in this approach the usual free damped

oscillator equation

is generalized to a damped oscillator equation of the form

possessing damping solutions with singularities, see eqs. (2,3,4) below. The new damping

solutions depend not only of the natural frequency ω0 and damping coeﬃcient β but also

on the parameter γ given by the general Riccati solution associated to the original two-

parameter damped equation. This γ parameter introduces a new time scale in the damping

phenomena that is related to the time at which the singularities occur. One can think of

ω(t) = ω2

(γt+1)2 as a time-depending frequency characterizing a damped chirp signal

generated through the general Riccati solution.

For the three types of free damping they have been obtained in I as follows:

(i) For underdamping, β2 < ω2

0, denoting ωu =

β2 the underdamped γ modes are

These are the only possible types of one-parameter damping modes related to the free

damping ones by means of Witten’s supersymmetric scheme and the general Riccati solution.

In practice, especially if the value of γ is very small, it is diﬃcult to measure it. In such

a case it is still possible to estimate γ through some powerful estimation methods. It is the

and collaborators [3] that is shown here to provide very good estimates for γ.

II. SYSTEM OF FIRST ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Notice that Eq. (1) can be re-written as

˙X1 = X2

˙X2 =

2βX2 +

−

(cid:18)

(γt + 1)2 −

ω2

0(cid:19)

X1 ,

2γ2

if X1 = y and X2 = ˙y. We will consider X1 as the naturally measured state (the most easy

to measure). Therefore, it seems logical to take X1 as the output of the system, that is

y = CX, where C = [1 0] and X is state vector. In addition, we would consider that β is

available in some way and only γ is an unknown parameter. Thus, the complete monitoring

of the system means the on-line estimation of X2 and the on-line identiﬁcation of the γ value.

The available methods for parameter identiﬁcation need that the unknown parameters are

in aﬃne form. In this case, it is clear that γ can not be expressed in an aﬃne form. To

overcome this diﬃculty we will estimate the following expression

Then, the system given by Eqs (5) and (6), can be rewritten as

2γ2

α =

0(cid:19)

.

˙X1 = X2

˙X2 =

2βX2 + αX1 .

Note that, even though α is not a constant, i.e., it is varying in time, its evolution is

signiﬁcant only close to the origin, that is, as time increases α turns into a constant. On

the other hand, the eﬀort (proportional to the error) made by the observer in its intent to

estimate the parameter can overcome this initial diﬃculty.

III. DESIGN OF AN ADAPTIVE OBSERVER

It is well known that only in very special occasions one can have a sensor on every state

variable, and some form of reconstruction from the available measurement output data is

3

needed, in many cases, high gain techniques proved to be very eﬃcient for state estimation,

leading to the now well-known high gain observer [5]. However, when a system depends on

some unknown parameters, the design of the observer has to be modiﬁed so that the state

variables and parameters could be estimated. This leads to the so called adaptive observers.

The problem of parameter estimation in dynamical systems has motivated extensive

studies of the adaptive observer designs for linear and nonlinear systems during the last

decade. Recently, a globally convergent adaptive observer has been developed for many

systems. It is based on a non trivial combination of a nonlinear high gain observer and a

linear adaptive observer, see references [3] and [8]. In this note, we show an application of

the high gain techniques in the context of state and parameter estimation.

The assumption on the considered class of systems are basically that if all parameters

were known, some high-gain observer could be designed in a classical way, and that the

system are “suﬃciently excited” in a sense which is close to the usually required assumption

on adaptive systems (the signals must be rich enough so that the unknown parameters can

indeed be indentiﬁed).

as follows:

Following [3] we assume that the model of a free damping motion system can be written

˙X = AX + ϕ(X) + Ψ(X)θ

̥ = 

y = CX

say, it is a vector whose values belong to some known compact set and should be estimated

through the measurements of the output y. In our particular case, we have n = 3, p = 1

and θ = α and therefore the entries of the matrix A are a1,1 = 0, a1,2 = 1, a2,1 = 0 and

a1,1 = 0, the entries of the matrix Ψ are ψ1,1 = 0 and ψ2,1 = X1, whereas the entries of the

matrix ϕ are ϕ1,1 = 0 and ϕ2,1 =

2β.

The algorithm used here is a special case of that presented in [3], since we do not have a

control input and also the unknown Riccati parameter is embedded in the time-dependent

quantity α that is estimated ﬁrst. We consider the following dynamical system

To recover now the value of the parameter γ from the estimated value of α, we solve the

Examining the denominator of the latter equation, we can ﬁgure out that there is a discon-

tinuity at td = √2/ (α + β2)

2 . In this case, the value of γ can be estimated with very good

1

accuracy until td.

With the aim of illustrating the idea proposed here, we will present computer simulations

in which we will take always ρ = 100 for the constant parameter deﬁning the diagonal matrix

Λ. Figures (2) - (5) show the results of numerical simulations for an underdamped case with

the following parameters: β = 0.04, γ = 0.15, k = 1.00, ω0 = 1.00. In ﬁgure (6), we present

numerical simulations for the Riccati parameter γ for the overdamped case with β = 1.0

and ω0 = 0.2 in the plot (a) and the critical case with β = ω0 = 0.1 in the plot (b). All of

the ﬁgures demonstrate the performance of the scheme for this particular application.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have shown that the adaptive observer scheme of Besan¸con et al is

an eﬀective procedure to rebuild the Riccati parameter of the class of damping modes of

Rosu and Reyes. Despite the fact that in the estimation algorithm we used an associated

time-varying quantity for which the exponential convergence is not guaranteed, we obtain

excellent results for the estimates of the unknown constant Riccati parameter. In addition,

the scheme provides very good estimates for the unknown states of this class of oscillators

for each of the three possible cases.

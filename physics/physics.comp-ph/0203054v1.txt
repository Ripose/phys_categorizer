Abstract

The thermodynamic properties of (T eF6)59 clusters that undergo temperature-driven phase transitions have been
calculated with a canonical J-walking Monte Carlo technique. A parallel code for simulations has been developed
and optimized on SUN3500 and CRAY-T3E computers. The Lindemann criterion shows that the clusters transform
from liquid to solid and then from one solid structure to another in the temperature region 60-130 K.

1. Introduction

tential:

The interest in phase transitions in ﬁnite systems
is two-fold: ﬁrstly, bulk properties of the material
can be simulated if the system is studied under pe-
riodic boundary conditions [1] and proper account
for rounding and shifting of the measurable quan-
tities is taken in the analysis. Secondly, free ﬁnite
systems, such as molecular clusters, are of interest
due to their peculiar properties, which are not ob-
served in bulk systems of the same substance [2].
These are important for the synthesis of nanoma-
terials and nanodevices [3].

We use a canonical Monte Carlo (MC) method to
investigate temperature-induced critical behavior
in clusters containing 59 T eF6 molecules.

Our model system contains 59 octahedral rigid
T eF6 molecules which are allowed to rotate and
translate. Their interaction is reliably described by
a Lennard-Jones and a Coulomb atom-atom po-

where q is a generalized coordinate; rij is the dis-

atom. The parameter values are taken from [4].

This orientation-dependent potential generates
rugged potential energy surfaces. How to tackle
the behavior of a system having a rugged potential
energy surface in MD simulations is discussed in
[5,6].

Here we tackle the problem with the help of the

jump-walking Monte Carlo method, [7,8], which is
a smart development of the Metropolis algorithm.
We have parallelized the code to speed up the com-
putations [9].

2. J-walking algorithm

(2)

(3)

In its general form, the method generates trial
moves from a higher-temperature (TJ ) equilib-
rium distribution with a probability speciﬁed by
the variable PJ :

P = min {1, q[x∗|x]}

where the Metropolis probability function is:
TJ ){V (x∗
q(x∗|x) = e−( 1

)−V (x)}

T − 1

V (x) is the potential energy of the system at a
temperature T and V (x∗) is the potential energy
of a new conﬁguration at the temperature TJ .

The remaining trial moves are of conventional

Metropolis character.

In our study we use multi-temperature general-

izations [10] of the basic approach.

We develop a parallel J-walking code that en-
ables us to carry out a Monte Carlo simulation
eﬃciently in a multiprocessor computing environ-
ment. We apply the code in the study of the ther-
modynamic properties of (T eF6)n, n = 59 clusters.
The J-walking technique can be implemented in
two ways. The ﬁrst approach is to write the con-
ﬁgurations from the simulation at the J-walking
temperature to an external ﬁle and access these
conﬁgurations randomly, while carrying out a sim-
ulation at the lower temperature. It is necessary to
access the external ﬁles randomly to avoid corre-
lation errors [11]. The large storage requirements
limit the application of the method to small sys-
tems. The second approach uses tandem walkers,
one at a high temperature where Metropolis sam-
pling is ergodic and multiple walkers at lower tem-
peratures.

The best features of these two approaches can
be combined into a single J-walking algorithm [12]
with the use of multiple processors and the Mes-
sage Passing Interface (MPI) library. We incorpo-
rate MPI functions into the MC code to send and

2

receive conﬁguration geometries and potential en-
ergies of the clusters. Instead of generating exter-
nal distributions and storing them before the ac-
tual simulation, we generate the required distri-
butions during simulation and pass them to the
lower-temperature walkers.
Parallel J-walking algorithm:
– Step 1. For each t make Metropolis MC steps:

· Rotate each molecule.
· Translate each molecule.
· Reject or accept step.
· Go to step 1.

– Step 2. After S1 steps - collect statistics:

· Potential energy histogram.
· Energy average and deviation.
· Heat capacity CV .
· Save current conﬁguration.

– Step 3. After S2 steps - make jump-walking step
by exchanging the conﬁgurations using MPI.

– Step 4. Go to step 1.
The diagram of model J-walking is shown in ﬁg.1.
Each square is a Metropolis MC simulation at
a particular temperature. The set of boxes on
the right-hand side represents the array of pre-
vious conﬁgurations of the system, which are
stored in the memory to avoid correlations be-
tween the lower and the higher temperature. At
each trial jump we randomly choose one of the
4 systems. When a conﬁguration is transmitted
to a lower-temperature process, it is a conﬁgura-
tion randomly chosen from the array of higher-
temperature walkers. The current conﬁguration
of the walker then replaces the conﬁguration just
passed from the array to another temperature.
In ﬁg.2 we show the parallel decomposition of
computation. Each process computes part of one
of 4 multistage J-walking chains, and exchanges
conﬁgurations and energy with others.

We use array sizes of 2500 conﬁgurations. The
number of conﬁgurations is limited by the proces-
sor RAM used in simulation. In the parallelization
implemented in our code, the arrays are small and
do not inhibit applications of the method to large
systems. For the computations in the present work
the number of MC passes for each temperature is
6.105 for each cluster containing 59 T eF6 molecules
(413 atoms). We make J-walk jump attempts at
every 50 Metropolis MC steps during the thermali-

sation and at every 150 steps during the main com-
putation.

The computer code has been ported, tested and
optimized on SUN 3500 and CRAY-T3E machines.
In our program dynamic memory management has
been implemented for optimal usage of the mem-
ory. We ﬁnd that memory and performance re-
quirement make CRAY-T3E more suitable for such
computations. In our runs we use 64 processors
each with 64 MB RAM. Each run of 6.105 steps
takes approximately 11h per CPU.

3. Results and Conclusions

Using the parallel code described in the previ-
ous section we make sets of production runs for 59
molecule clusters. The previous MD analysis of the
temperature behavior of T eF6 clusters pointed out
a two-step structural transformation process [13]
from an orientationally disordered bcc structure
below cluster solidiﬁcation to an orientationally
oriented ordered monoclinic structure detected at
low T (below 20K). The ﬁrst step involves lattice
reconstruction (bcc to monoclinic) and a partial
order of one of the molecular axes, when the cluster
is cooled down to its freezing point. This transition
has been proved to be a ﬁrst-order phase change
[14] by detecting coexisting phases. A further tem-
perature decrease causes complete orientational or-
der of the three molecular axes. This transforma-
tion is continuous. The diagnostic method devel-
oped in [13] has been implemented to animate the
solid-solid transformations [15].

To distinguish between the diﬀerent phases,
which the clusters adopt at diﬀerent temperatures,
we have computed the Lindemann index [16]:

δlin =

in interval 100K −115K. In the interval 75K −80K
the angle of the curve has changed.

We calculate the radial distribution function to
reconstruct the crystal lattice. Fig.4 and ﬁg.5 show
the normalized radial distribution function for dis-
tances between centers of the T eF6 molecules (T e
atoms). Fig.4 is at 157. The peaks of the curve
correspond to disordered liquid structure. Fig.5 is
at 76K where the peaks correspond to an ordered
structure (bcc lattice).

In this study a J-walking Monte Carlo algorithm
has been implemented to study (T eF6) clusters. A
parallel J-walking code has been developed. Ther-
modynamic properties have been observed in the
range from 60K to 150K. We can compare the re-
sults to the results obtained from MD simulations.

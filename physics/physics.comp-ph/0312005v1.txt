Positive Decompositions of Exponential Operators

Siu A. Chin
Department of Physics, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA

The solution of many physical evolution equations can be expressed as an exponential of two or
more operators. Approximate solutions can be systematically derived by decomposing the expo-
nential in a product form. For time-reversible equations, such as the Hamilton or the Schr¨odinger
equation, it is immaterial whether the decomposition coeﬃcients are positive or negative. For time-
irreversible systems, such as the Fokker-Planck equation or the quantum statistical propagator,
only positive-coeﬃcient decompositions which respect the time-irreversibility of the diﬀusion kernel
can yield practical algorithms. These positive time step, or forward decompositions, are a highly
in order
restrictive class of factorization algorithms. This work proves a fundamental theorem:
for a 2nth order forward algorithm to become (2n + 2)th order, one must include a new, higher
order commutator in the decomposition process. Since these higher order commuatators are highly
complex, it seems diﬃcult to produce practical forward algorithms beyond fourth order. This proof
generalize the Sheng-Suzuki theorem for the case of n = 1. In particular, this work shows that it is
not possible to have a sixth order forward algorithm by including just the [V, [T, V ]] commutator.

INTRODUCTION

= (T + V )w,

w(t + ǫ) = eǫ(T +V )w(t),

N

eǫ(T +V ) =

etiǫT eviǫV ,

Many physical evolution equations, from classical mechanics, ﬂuid mechanics, statistical mechanics to quantum

mechanics, all have the form

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

where T and V are non-commuting operators. Such an equation can be solved iteratively via

provided that one has a suitable approximation for the short time evolution operator eǫ(T +V ). Usually, eǫT and eǫV
can be solved exactly; therefore by decomposing eǫ(T +V ) to high order in the form

i=1
Y
one can expect to solve (1.1) via (1.2) with great accuracy. This expectation is indeed realized classically, where
each factorization of the form (1.3) produces a symplectic integrator for integrating classical trajectories. An entire
literature1,2,3 exists on producing symplectic integrators of the form (1.3).

However, as one examines these algorithms closely, one is immediately struck by the fact that beyond second order,
all these algorithms contain negative coeﬃcients for both T and V operators. Since the fundamental diﬀusion kernel
cannot be simulated or integrated backward in time, none of these higher order algorithms can be applied to time-
irreversible systems. This lack of positive decomposition coeﬃcients beyond second order was ﬁrst noted and proved
by Sheng4. Sheng showed that the set of equations for determining the third order coeﬃcients in (1.3) are incompatible
if the coeﬃcients
were assumed to be positive. This is a valuable demonstration, but it shed no light on the
cause of this incompatibility nor oﬀered any clue on how to overcome this deﬁciency. Suzuki5 later proved that the
incompatibility can be viewed more geometrically. His proof tracks the coeﬃcients of the operator T T V and T V V in
the product expansion of (1.3). If the expansion were correct to third order, then the coeﬃcients for both operator
must be 1/3!. The coeﬃcient condition for one corresponds to a hyerplane and the other, a hypersphere. Suzuki
then go on to show that for the same set of positive coeﬃcients, the hyperplane cannot intersect the hypersphere and
therefore no real solutions are possible.

(cid:19)

where the last equality deﬁnes the approximate Hamiltonian of the product decomposition. The goal of decomposition
is to keep eT = eV = 1 and forces all other error coeﬃcients such as eT V , eT T V , eV T V , etc., to zero. By tracing the
incompatability condition to the coeﬃcients of speciﬁc operators, one can identify which error term cannot be made
to vanish. The operator T T V can only occur in [T, [T, V ]] and T V V only in [V, [T, V ]]. Thus the incompatability
condition is equivalent to the fact that for positive coeﬃcients
, eT T V and eV T V cannot both be reduced
to zero. To circumvent this, it is suﬃce to force one error coeﬃcient to zero and keep the other commutator in
the decomposition process. Since in quantum mechanics [V, [T, V ] corresponds to a local function, just like the
potential, Suzuki6 suggested that one should factorize eε(T +V ) in terms of T , V and [V, [T, V ]]. Following up on
this suggestion, Suzuki7 and Chin8 have derived fourth order factorization algorithms with only positive coeﬃcients.
Chin8 has further shown that classically, [V, [T, V ]] give rises to a modiﬁed force ﬁrst suggested by Ruth9. Chin
and collabortors have since abundantly demonstrated the usefulness of these forward time step algorithms in solving
both time-irreversible10,11,12,13 and time-reversible problems8,14,15,16. Jang et al.17 have use them in doing quantum
statistical calculations and Omelyan et al.18,19 have produced an extensive collection of higher order algorithms (but
with negative coeﬃcients) based on this class of fourth order forward algorithms.

{

}

A natural question therefore arises: with the inclusion of the operator [V, [T, V ]], can one produce forward time step
algorithms of sixth or higher order? The answer provided by this work is “no”. We prove that in going from order
2n to 2n + 2, a forward time step algorithm must include at least one new commutator. Due to the complexicity of
these higher order commutators, it seems diﬃcult to formulate forward algorithms beyond fourth order.

In the next section we revisit Suzuki’s proof of the Sheng-Suzuki theorem and prove it in a completely diﬀerent
way that is generalizable to higher order. In Section III, we prove the incompatability of positive coeﬃcients in the
general case of 2nth order. Section IV summarizes some conclusions.

II. PROVING THE SHENG-SUZUKI THEOREM

Suzuki proved his result using a particular form of the product expansion which in our notation reads

ev0εV

etiεT eviεV .

N

i=1
Y

This implied asymmetry between the
coeﬃcients is unnecessary. We will use just the general expansion
(1.3). The discussion of this section follows closely the recent related work on symplectic corrector algorithms20, but
with one crucial improvement. This improvement obliterates the need to maximize the function g deﬁned below and
allows the proof to be generalized to higher order.
The left hand side of (1.4) can be expanded as

Matching the ﬁrst order terms in ε gives constraints

Our approach will be to identify the error coeﬃcients explicitly and consider the resulting condition when they are
set to zero. To determine the error coeﬃcients, we focus on a particular operator in (2.3) whose coeﬃcient contains
eT V , eT T V or eV T V and match that operator’s coeﬃcients in the expansion of (2.2). For example, in the ε2 terms of
(2.3), the coeﬃcient of the operator T V is ( 1

2 + eT V ). Equating this to the coeﬃcents of T V from (2.2) gives

By setting eT T V and eT V T to zero on the left hand sides of (2.9) and (2.10), the numerical coeﬃcient is 1/3! only if
eT V = 0. This point was not made explicit in Suzuki’s proof. For a symmetric product form such that t1 = 0 and
vi = vN −i+1, ti+1 = tN −i+1, or vN = 0 and vi = vN −i, ti = tN −i+1, one has

This implies that HA(ε) must be a even function of ε and eT V = 0 is automatic. Since all odd order errors in HA(ε)
vanish, the coeﬃcients

must obey

to ensure that T 2n−1V has the correct expansion coeﬃcient. It is cumbersome to deal with symmetric coeﬃcients
directly, it is much easier to use the general form (1.3) and to invoke (2.12) when symmetric factorization is assumed.
To show that there cannot be positive coeﬃcient decomposition of the form (1.3) beyond second order, it is suﬃce

to demonstrate that eT V , eT T V and eT V T cannot all be zero for the same set of decomposition coeﬃcients

Suzuki’s geometric argument5 can still be applied, but one would have to compute the intersection of the hyperplanes
ﬁrst before comparing it to the hypersphere’s radius. Instead of dealing with this two step process, we will use the
method of constrainted minimization which can be generalized verbatim to higher order.

For positive

III. THE HIGHER ORDER CASE

By incorporating the potential-like operator [V, [T, V ]], many families15,18,19 of fourth order forward time step
algorithms have been found. They are not only indispensable for solving time-irreversible equations10,11,12,13 but
are also superior to existing fourth order algorithms in solving time-reversible classical8,16,18,19 and quantum14,15

dynamical equations. It is therefore of great interest to determine whether there exist practical forward algorithms
of even higher order. The emphasis here is on “practical”, on whether they can be easily implemented numerically.
We show in this section that higher order forward algorithms requires the inclusion higher order commutators. The
inclusion of [V, [T, V ]] which make possible fourth order forward algorithms, is not suﬃcient to guarantee a sixth order
forward algorithm. In general, we will show that if F2n(ε) is a 2nth order forward decomposition of eε(T +V ), then
F2n+2(ε) would require the inclusion of a new operator not previously included in the construction of F2n(ε). We
have proved the case of n = 1 in the last section. The new operator being

V1 ≡

[V, [T, V ].

Consider now the case n = 2. In the following discussion, we will use the condensed bracket notation: [V 2T 3V ]

[V, [V, [T, [T, [T, V ]]]]], etc.. With the inclusion of V1, a symmetric fourth order forward algorithm has the form

in fourth order. These error operators are results of concatenating T and V with lower order operators on the left.
In each order, not all the operators are independent. For example, setting C = [AB] in the Jacobi identity

gives [ABC] = [BAC] and therefore

[ABC] + [BCA] + [CAB] = 0,

[ABAB] = [BAAB].

For the case where [V T V ] commutes with V we also have [V nV T V ] = 0. Hence there are only two independent
operators [T T T V ], [T V T V ] in third order and four operators [T T T T V ], [V T T T V ], [T T V T V ], [V T V T V ] in fourth
order. The last two are just [T T V1] and [V T V1], which resemble second order errors for a new potential V1. To have a
sixth order algorithm, one must eliminate these four error terms. With the inclusion of V1, one can certainly eliminate
[T T V1] and [V T V1]. The remaining error terms [T T 3V ] and [V T 3V ] are unaﬀected by V1 and can only be eleminated
by the choice of coeﬃcients
. By repeating the argument of last section, we can again show that this is not
possible. Instead of doing that, we will prove the more general case below. To have a sixth order algorithm, one
must include either operator [T T 3V ] or [V T 3V ] in the decomposition process. Since [T T 3V ] depends linearly on the
coeﬃcients, it can always be eliminated by including enough eεviV operators in the product. One should
set of
therefore add the operator

The entire argument as discussed above can be repeated for order 2n. Given F2n(ε), in order to obtain F2n+2(ε)

The RHS coeﬃcients are correct only if there is no error of one order lower to contaiminate them (as in the case of

IV. CONCLUSIONS

7

Forward time steps decomposition schemes are a highly restrictive class of algorithms crucial for solving time-
irreversible equations. Even for solving time-reversible equations, they are superior to existing symplectic algorithms
with backward time steps of the same order16,19. Despite their essential usefulness, aside from the Sheng-Suzuki
theorem, almost nothing is known about the structure of these forward algorithms. This work proves a general result
which contains the Sheng-Suzuki theorem as a special case.

This work further shows that there is regularity to the existence of forward algorithms.

In order to have only
positive time steps, one must continue to enlarge one’s collection of constitutent operators for factorizing eε(T +V ). For
a 2n order forward algorithm one must include all commutators of the form [V T 2k−1V ] from k = 1 to k = n
1 in
addition to T and V . More speciﬁcally, this work shows that it is not possible to have a sixth order forward algorithm
by including only the operator [V T V ]; the commutator [V T 3V ] is also required.

−

The need to include [V T 3V ] make it diﬃcult to construct, but does not necessarily preclude the possibility of a
sixth order forward algorithm. One simply has to work harder to devise practical ways of obtaining [V T 3V ] without
computing it directly. Work is currently in progress toward this goal.

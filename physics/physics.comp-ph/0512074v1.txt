Abstract

−

Maxwell’s equations for propagation of electromagnetic waves in dispersive and absorp-
tive (passive) media are represented in the form of the Schr¨odinger equation i∂Ψ/∂t =
HΨ, where H is a linear diﬀerential operator (Hamiltonian) acting on a multi-dimensional
vector Ψ composed of the electromagnetic ﬁelds and auxiliary matter ﬁelds describing the
medium response. In this representation, the initial value problem is solved by applying
the fundamental solution exp(
itH) to the initial ﬁeld conﬁguration. The Faber polyno-
mial approximation of the fundamental solution is used to develop a numerical algorithm
for propagation of broad band wave packets in passive media. The action of the Hamilto-
nian on the wave function Ψ is approximated by the Fourier grid pseudospectral method.
The algorithm is global in time, meaning that the entire propagation can be carried out
in just a few time steps. A typical time step is much larger than that in ﬁnite diﬀerencing
−1. The accuracy and stability of the algorithm is analyzed. The

1 Introduction

Many time-domain algorithms for numerical simulations of the broad band wave packet propa-
gation in electrodynamics of passive media and/or quantum mechanics use a time stepping, that
is, given a conﬁguration of the system at time t, a time-domain algorithm produces the system
conﬁguration at time t + ∆t, where the time step ∆t is determined by conditions resulting from
the algorithm stability and required accuracy. For instance, in a ﬁnite diﬀerencing approach,
such as, e.g., the classical leapfrog scheme, the time step is bounded from above by the stability
condition (the Courant limit), ∆t
∆tC. The upper bound ∆tC is typically determined by
the time a signal needs to propagate through an elementary cell of the spatial grid, which is
by several orders of magnitude smaller than the total propagation time [1]. There is a class
of problems in numerical electromagnetism where the wave packet dynamics at intermediate
times is not of signiﬁcant interest, but rather the ﬁnal state is important. Computing the scat-
tering matrix would give one such example. A related and more sophisticated example would
be simulations of the broad band wave packet propagation in random media [2]. To obtain a
numerical solution of the initial-value problem in this case, the propagation must be carried
out multiple times for every (random) state of the medium in order to perform the statistical

The present work oﬀers a global time-domain algorithm for solving initial value problems
for Maxwell’s equations for passive media whose dispersive and absorptive properties can be
described by suitable Lorentz, or Rocard-Powels-Debye, or Drude models. The basic idea of
our approach can be summarized as follows. In Section 2, the Maxwell equations are cast in
the form of the Schr¨odinger equation

i

∂Ψ
∂t

= HΨ ,

(1.1)

where Ψ is a multidimensional vector ﬁeld whose components are electromagnetic ﬁelds and
a set of auxiliary ﬁelds that describe the medium response to applied electromagnetic ﬁelds
(e.g., the medium polarization), and H is a linear diﬀerential operator that depends on the
medium dispersive and absorptive properties. Its spectrum is real if no attenuation is present,
and has a negative imaginary part otherwise. The squared L2 norm of Ψ is proportional to the
electromagnetic energy of the wave packet.

If Ψ0 is the initial wave packet conﬁguration, then Ψ(t) can be found by using the funda-

mental solution of Eq. (1.1)

Ψ(t) = e−itH Ψ0 .

(1.2)

Given some (grid) approximation of the spatial dependence of H and Ψ, Eq. (1.2) provides
a numerical solution of the initial value problem. In what follows the same letters are used
for spatial continuum and grid representations of the Hamiltonian and wave functions, unless
noted otherwise. An exact solution of the initial value problem is understood here in the sense

2

of (1.2) where H is a ﬁnite matrix obtained from the continuous Hamiltonian by means of a
suitable, suﬃciently accurate, spatial (grid) representation.

If H can be directly diagonalized, then (1.2) gives an exact solution for any value of t > 0.
But this is precisely what one wants to avoid in numerical simulations because the matrix
H is typically huge and the direct diagonalization is too expensive, if impossible at all. For
this reason, time domain algorithms use the semigroup property of the fundamental solution:
i∆tH)]N , where ∆t = t/N with an integer N being the number of time
exp(
steps. For a suﬃciently small time step ∆t, typically, ∆t
is the (matrix)
norm of H, the action of the inﬁnitesimal evolution operator exp(
i∆tH) on the state vector
Ψ can be approximated by various means that do not require any direct diagonalization of H.

Section 3 is devoted to an algorithm that involves neither a direct diagonalization of H nor
many time steps. It is based on the well known approximation of an analytical function by
the Faber polynomial series [3] (see also the textbooks [4]). The Faber approximation method
has been applied to quantum scattering problems [5] to compute the causal Green’s function
for the Schr¨odinger equation. The Faber polynomial approximation of the exponential of a
non-Hermitian operator has also been used to solve the initial value problem for the Liouville
- von Neumann equation that describes the time evolution of the density matrix in statistical
systems [6, 7]. In the case when the spectrum of H is real, the approximation yields the well
known Chebyshev propagation method that has been developed to study wave packet dynamics
in quantum systems [8, 9, 10] and later used in electrodynamics of non-dispersive media [11].

We apply the Faber propagation scheme to solve initial value problems in electrodynamics of
passive media reformulated in the form of the Schr¨odinger equation (1.1) with a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian,

Ψ(t + ∆tF ) = e−i∆tF HΨ(t)

Here ck(∆tF ) are the expansion coeﬃcients and Fk(H) are Faber polynomials. The action of
Fk(H) on Ψ(t) can be computed recursively. The recursion relation depends on the choice of
the family of Faber polynomials. The latter, in turn, is motivated by spectral properties of H.
An important point to note is that the expansion (1.3) gives an accurate approximation for the
−1 and, hence, the propagation can

be done in just a few time steps. The Faber series (1.3) is known to converge exponentially as
the approximation order n increases. The accuracy of the algorithm is assessed in Section 4. In
Sections 5 and 6 the algorithm is applied to scattering of broad band laser pulses on a dielectric
grating. Dispersive properties of the grating material are described by the Rocard-Powels-
Debye model with a single pole. The frequency band of the initial pulse is chosen to cover
the anomalous dispersion range (the pole) of the dielectric. The Faber propagation scheme is
shown to be more eﬃcient than the Lanczos-Arnoldi propagation scheme applied earlier to the

same system [12]. The Courant limit can be exceeded in at least 3000 times, ∆tF ≥
Due to the exponential convergence of the algorithm it can be used as a benchmark for testing
various time propagation schemes. Note also that it can be applied with any suitable ﬁnite-

spectral representation). In our simulations, the Fourier grid pseudospectral representation of
H has been used [13, 14].

The over-dot denotes the partial derivative with respect to time, and c is the speed of light in

of the medium in question.

As an example we consider the Rocard-Powles-Debye model dielectric (the ionic crystal
model [15, 16]) with one resonance, which is used in our numerical simulations. The case with
multiple resonances can be studied in a similar fashion. In this model H = B, and the Fourier
harmonics of the electric ﬁeld and induction of frequency ω are related by D(ω) = ε(ω)E(ω)

relative to the conventional L2 scalar product, and the norm (or energy) is conserved.

In our simulations, an absorbing layer of a conducting medium has been introduced at the
grid boundaries to prevent reﬂections of the wave packet. The conductivity σ of the layer
depends on position. The induced current in a conducting media has the form σE. Hence, in
4πi√ε∞σ
the presence of the conducting layer the Hamiltonian (2.4) is modiﬁed by inserting
in place of zero in the upper-right corner. Further details can be found in our earlier works
[17, 18, 12].

3 Faber polynomial propagation scheme

Let D be a bounded, closed continuum in the complex plane such that the complement of D
is simply connected in the extended complex plane and contains the point at z =
(e.g.,
a polygon, an ellipse, etc.). By the Riemann mapping theorem [4], there exists a conformal
mapping ξ which maps the complement of a closed disk with center at the origin and radius ρ
onto the complement of D, satisfying the normalization condition, ξ(w)/w

approximation (1.3) of the fundamental solution of (1.1).

The Faber polynomial algorithm for solving initial value problems for (1.1) is as follows.
First, choose a (Jourdan) contour Γ that encloses the spectrum of H. Some criteria for choos-
ing a contour are discussed in the next section. Second, ﬁnd the corresponding conformal
mapping ξ. In particular, if Γ is a polygon, this task can be accomplished by the Schwartz-
Christoﬀel transformation. For complicated polygons, there is a numerical algorithm to do so
[20]. Next, the Faber expansion coeﬃcients ck(∆tF ) are computed by means of (3.3) where
f (z) = exp(
i∆tF z). The action of the Faber polynomials of H on Ψ(t) in (1.3) is computed
using the recursion relation (3.2). Let Φk = Fk(H)Ψ(t). Then

for any domain bounded by ΓR, R > ρ, to which f can be extended analytically. Thus, the
Faber series (1.3) converges exponentially as the approximation order n increases. From (4.8)
some basic principles for choosing the contour Γ follow.

First, because of the exponential convergence of the Faber series, it is desired to make the
logarithmic capacity ρ as small as possible. Alternatively, if ρ is set to one, the scaling factor β
must be as small as possible, that is, the contour should enclose the spectrum of H as tight as
possible. In principle, if the structure of the spectrum of H (or, at least, its range) is roughly
known, one can ﬁnd a polygon that tightly encloses the spectrum. The corresponding conformal
mapping can be computed numerically [20]. The unfortunate feature of this approach is that the
inﬁnite Laurent series (3.1) is required. Hence, the recursion relation (3.4) becomes memory
unfriendly in numerical simulations: All the preceding Φk must be kept in the operational
memory. Thus, when choosing the contour, one should compromise between the approximation
order and the memory use eﬃciency of the algorithm [5].

Second, if possible, the contour Γ should not go too far into the upper part of the complex
and to allow for larger
plane to avoid the exponential growth of the factor maxΓ
time steps. Note that the necessary accuracy can still be reached, even if the contour goes
through the upper part of the complex plane, by increasing the approximation order n. The
latter, however, would lead to a less eﬃcient propagation scheme because more operations per
time step is required.

5 The case of an elliptic contour

Faber polynomials associated with an elliptic contour have the simplest (shortest) recursion
relation [4]. For this reason this family of the Faber polynomials have been used in many
aforementioned applications in quantum and statistical mechanics. Here we use the Faber
polynomials associated with an ellipse to illustrate the Faber propagation scheme in electrody-

Here Jk is the Bessel function. When computing the integral (3.5) we assume that γ1 > 0 (which
is consistent with the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian H used in our simulations). The
exponential convergence of the Faber series can easily be seen from the exponential decay of
the Bessel function for k > 2∆ts√γ1.

The Hamiltonian (2.4) cannot have eigenvalues with positive imaginary parts, otherwise
the energy of the wave packet (the squared norm of Ψ) would increase with time, which is not
possible in passive media. Hence, by physical reasons, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian lies
in the lower half of the complex plane. It is also clear that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian
is symmetric about the imaginary axis (for every direction in space, there are incoming and
outgoing waves). Hence, we set x0 = 0. The spectrum of H lies in a rectangle [

Observe that if v = 0, that is, if the spectrum of H is real, the optimal ellipse has b = 0 and

series. Unfortunately, when v
= 0 by making β smaller we increase the number b + y0, that is,
the ellipse gets farther into the upper half of the complex plane and higher orders of the Faber
approximation are needed to achieve desired accuracy according to (4.8). So, in our simulations
we take β larger than its minimal value and thereby reduce b + y0 by making b smaller (see
next Section for details).

6 Applications to nanostructured periodic materials

As an example of possible applications of the present method to photonics, the Faber propa-
gation scheme associated with an elliptic contour is applied to scattering of broad band wave
packets on nanostructured periodic materials, the subject of current interest in photonics [25].
We consider a grating made of a periodic array of ionic crystal cylinders in vacuum. This
system has been previously studied by the Lanczos-Arnoldi time propagation scheme [12]. In
particular, the role of trapped modes (guided wave resonances) and polaritonic excitations in
transmission and reﬂection properties of the grating in the infrared range has been elucidated.

Apart from illustrating the Faber propagation scheme, our primary interest is to compare its
eﬃciency with the eﬃciency of the Lanczos-Arnoldi propagation scheme.

The geometry of the system is sketched in the inset of Fig. 2. The system has a translation
symmetry along one of the Euclidean axes, chosen to be the y axis. It is periodic along the
x axis with period Dg, while the z direction is transverse to the grating. The packing density
R/Dg = 0.1, where R is the radius of cylinders and Dg = 10.8 µm is the grating period.
The broad band wave packet is represented by a Gaussian pulse that is about 38 fs long and
has the carrier frequency of 173 meV. It propagates along the z axis and is linearly polarized
with the electric ﬁeld oriented along the y axis, i.e., parallel to the cylinders (the so called
TE polarization). The spectrum of the wave packet is concentrated in a wavelength domain
Dg such that the scattering is dominated by the zero diﬀraction mode (the reﬂected and
λ
transmitted beams propagate mainly along the z-axis). A change of variables is used in both x
(x = f1(x1)) and z (z = f2(x2)) coordinates to enhance the sampling eﬃciency in the vicinity
of medium interfaces so that the boundary conditions are accurately reproduced by the Fourier
15.3Dg,
grid pseudospectral method. A typical size of the mesh corresponds to
0.5Dg with, respectively, 384 and 64 mesh points. Note that, because of
and
the variable change, a uniform mesh in the auxiliary coordinates (x1, x2) corresponds to a non-
uniform mesh in the physical (x, z) space. The Lanczos-Arnoldi time propagation is carried out
with a ﬁxed time step ∆tL = 0.138 fs. The propagation by the Faber method has been done
with diﬀerent time steps ∆tF = j∆tL, with j = 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 1000 (see below).

The dielectric function of the ionic crystal material is approximated by the single oscillator
model (2.3). Following the work [15], we chose the parameters representative for the beryllium
oxide: ε∞ = 2.99, ε0 = 6.6, ωT = 87.0 meV, and the damping η = 11.51 meV. Thus, for
Dg = 10.8µm two types of resonances can be excited in the system within the frequency domain
covered by the incident pulse. Structure resonances are characteristic for periodic dielectric
gratings. They are associated with the existence of guided wave modes [26, 27]. As has been
demonstrated previously, in the absence of losses, structure resonances lead to 100% reﬂection
Dg. The second type of resonances

The existence of a trapped mode (resonance) can easily be inferred from the temporal
evolution of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The main transmitted pulse is clearly visible. It has
a signiﬁcant amplitude and a duration about 38 fs. After the main pulse passes the array,
it leaves behind excited quasistationary modes which loose their energy by radiating almost
monochromatic waves. By symmetry, the same radiation of quasistationary modes is registered
in the reﬂection direction by a detector placed in front of the layer (not shown here). The
quasistationary mode associated with polaritonic excitations in the ionic crystal has a wave
DT and is short-lived due to the strong absorption of the material at the resonance
length λ
(the anomalous dispersion region). Therefore the observed lasing eﬀect is mainly due to the
long-lived structure resonance at λ
Dρ. The radiation of this mode appears as exponentially
damped oscillations coming after the main signal. An exponential decay due to a ﬁnite lifetime
of the quasi-stationary mode is clearly seen. The resonance lifetime is in the picosecond range,
i.e., a thousand times longer than the initial pulse duration. For lossless media, the existence
of the quasistationary mode(s) leads to a 100% reﬂection at the resonant frequency, as has
[12, 28]. Finally, the concept of trapped modes localized

on successive layers and interacting with each other provides a theoretical framework for light
propagation in layered structures such as photonic crystal slabs [29].

It follows from our results that the Faber propagation scheme has a higher accuracy than
the Lanczos-Arnoldi propagation at reduced computational costs. The error was saturated at
10−10 value when 10 signiﬁcant digits in the calculated signal where found to coincide. The
peaks correspond mainly to the instants of time when the oscillating electric ﬁeld is close to
zero. The gain in the propagation eﬃciency as compared to the Lanczos-Arnoldi scheme is
twofold. First, a smaller number of actions of H on Ψ(t) is needed to obtain Ψ(t + ∆tF ). In
the Faber propagation scheme, it is given by the order of the Faber polynomial approximation
of the fundamental solution, NF = n. In the case of the Lanczos-Arnoldi scheme, the number
of actions of H on Ψ(t) is given by NL = K∆tF /∆tL where K is the dimension of the Krylov
space. For the precision shown in Fig. 3, K = 7. Second, as we have already discussed in

12

Ref.[12], for a typical size of the mesh as used here, computational costs of acting by H on
Ψ(t) are comparable with those of constructing an orthonormal basis for the Krylov space (by
means of the Arnoldi process) and projecting the Hamiltonian onto the Krylov space (a K
K
Hessenberg matrix for a non-Hermitian H). This explains an extra factor 2.5 in the fourth
column of Table 1. For signiﬁcantly larger sizes of the mesh, in particular, for 3D simulations,
the computational costs of acting by H on Ψ should prevail, and the gain in the computation
time should simply scale as NL/NF .

×

It is worth noting that memory requirements are lower for the present Faber propagation
owing to the short recursion relation (associated with an elliptic contour). Indeed, in the case
of the Lanczos-Arnoldi scheme the number of vectors to be kept in the operational memory
equals K.

7 Conclusions

We have shown that the Faber propagation scheme can successfully be used in electrodynamics
of passive media. The scheme is global in time, that is, it allows one for time steps that
exceed the Courant limit in a few orders of magnitude. As a point of fact, the propagation can
actually be carried out in a single time step if the system in question does not have long-lived
quasistationary modes (as the structure resonance in the example we have considered above).

13

The essential virtue of the scheme is the exponential convergence, which leads to superior
accuracy as compared to other time domain methods in passive media. The Faber propagation
scheme can therefore be used as a benchmark, when comparing various propagation methods.
If the medium is lossless and no absorber is present, the Faber scheme coincides with the
Chebyshev propagation scheme, whose high accuracy is well known in time domain methods
in computational quantum physics.

Another advantage of the present Faber propagation scheme is a relatively low memory
demand. This, however, is essentially due to an elliptic contour which leads to a family of Faber
polynomials that are generated by a short recursion relation. For example, the conventional
leapfrog (time diﬀerencing) propagation scheme requires to have two arrays Ψ(t) and Ψ(t
∆t)
in the operational memory to compute Ψ(t + ∆t), while in the Faber scheme associated with
an elliptic contour, a recursive computation of the sum (1.3) requires storing three arrays
Ψm(t + ∆tF ), Φm, and Φm−1, where Ψm is the series (1.3) with k = 0, 1, ..., m
n, and
m = 1, 2, ..., n being the recurrence running index, Ψm+1 = Ψm + cm+1Φm+1. However, the gain
of the Faber scheme in eﬃciency and accuracy is enormous.

≤

It should be noted that we have not explored a further optimization of the present Faber
propagation scheme because our main goal was to compare it with the Lanczos-Arnoldi prop-
agation scheme (which was applied to the above system and shown to be more accurate and
eﬃcient than a typical ﬁnite diﬀerencing (leapfrog) scheme). For any application, the opti-
mization should include the following. First, the spread of the spectrum along the real axis
is essentially determined by the smallest grid spatial step. So, depending on the accuracy de-
mand, Em can be reduced. Second, the absorbing layer can also be optimized to reduce the
spread v of the spectrum along the imaginary axis. In addition, one can try to estimate (e.g.,
by perturbation theory) imaginary parts of eigenvalues with large real parts (of order Em).
This would lead to a tighter ellipse. Finally, the contour shape itself can also be optimized,
which, in general, requires a better knowledge of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. Thus, for
a speciﬁc problem on hands, the Faber propagation scheme can be made even more eﬃcient
than the simplest example presented in our work.

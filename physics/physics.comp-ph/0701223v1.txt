We present a variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method that works equally well for the ground
and the excited states of a quantum system. The method is based on the minimization of the
variance of energy, as opposed to the energy itself in standard methods. As a test, it is applied to
the investigation of the universal spectrum at the van der Waals length scale for two identical Bose
atoms in a symmetric harmonic trap, with results compared to the basically exact results obtained
from a multiscale quantum-defect theory.

INTRODUCTION

Monte Carlo methods have played an important role in
our understanding of a variety of quantum systems, espe-
cially few- and many-body quantum systems with strong
interactions that are diﬃcult to treat otherwise (see, e.g.,
Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]). It is also well-known, however,
that most quantum Monte Carlo methods [2, 3] are for-
mulated in such a way that they are strictly applicable
only to the ground state of a quantum system, a restric-
tion that has severely limited their applicability. Con-
sider, for example, the gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates
(BEC) of alkali-metal atoms (see, e.g., [7]). Any theory
that intends to treat the real atomic interaction has to
deal with the fact that the gaseous BEC branch of states
are in fact highly excited states of a many-atom system.
There are many branches of states of lower energies, in-
cluding the ﬁrst branch of liquid states as suggested and
studied recently by one of us [8].

In this paper we present a variational Monte Carlo
(VMC) method that works the same way for either the
ground or the excited states of a quantum system. It is
based on the minimization of the variance of energy, and
is the method underlying a recent investigation of the
universal equation of state at the van der Waals length
scale [8, 9] for few atoms in a trap [10]. The details of
the method were skipped in the earlier article [10], both
because the focus there was on a single gaseous BEC
state, which was not the best example illustrating the
method, and because there were no other independent
results to directly compared with, except in the shape-
independent limit [10].

We present here, in Sec.

II, the details of the vari-
ational Monte Carlo method based on the minimization
of the variance of energy and shows that it applies equally
well to the ground and the excited states of a quantum
system. In Sec. III, we present a better illustration of
the method through the universal spectrum at the van
der Waals length scale for two identical Bose atoms in a
symmetric harmonic trap. It is an example where results

for multiple energy levels can be obtained independently
using other methods [11, 12, 13, 14], including, in partic-
ular, a multiscale quantum-defect theory (QDT) [15, 16].
Conclusions are given in Sec. IV. We point out that in
the process of writing this article, we have discovered
that an equivalent approach has been developed earlier
by Umrigar et al.
[17]. The derivation of our method,
and the applications presented here and earlier [10], are
however diﬀerent.

II. VARIANCE MINIMIZATION VARIATIONAL
MONTE CARLO METHOD

Consider the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation

H |Ψni = En |Ψni ,

(1)

where the energy eigenstates |Ψni form a complete, or-
thonormal basis.

Existing quantum Monte Carlo methods are mostly
based on the fact that for an arbitrary trial wave function
satisfying proper boundary conditions, we have

ET [ΨT ] ≡ D

which means that the ground state wave function is the
one that minimizes the energy functional ET [ΨT ]. The
proof can be found in standard quantum mechanics text-
books (see, e.g., [18]).

The variance minimization variational Monte Carlo
method (VMVMC), as proposed here, is based on the

The proof of Eq. (3) and its physical meaning can be best
understood by expanding the trial wave function using
the complete basis deﬁned by Eq. (1) to write η[ΨT ] as

η[ΨT ] =

m |hΨm|ΨT i|2 (Em − ET )2

From Eq. (4), it is clear that zero is the minimum of
the functional η[ΨT ], and this minimum is reached when
and only when ET = En and hΨm|ΨT i = 0 for m 6= n,
namely, only when |ΨT i is an eigenstate of energy as de-
ﬁned by Eq. (1). This statement is equally applicable to
the ground and the excited states of a quantum system.
The implementation of VMVMC, based on the mini-
mization of the variance of energy η[ΨT ], is straightfor-
ward. It does not require much more than the standard
VMC, as we illustrate here using the example of identical
particles.

Consider N identical particles in an external potential
and interacting via pairwise interactions. It is described
by a Hamiltonian:

with

ˆhi = −

i + Vext(ri) .

Here Vext(r) is the external “trapping” potential, and
v(r) is the interaction between particles.

For the evaluation of the energy functional, we have

This is the standard integral in VMC, and can be eval-

The computation of the variance of energy, Eq. (3), has
thus been reduced to two integrals, Eqs. (7) and (14),
both of which involving the same local energy, ELoc, that
one encounters in standard VMC. It is clear that the for-
mulation and the equations in this section are applicable
to both bosons and fermions.

One can easily show that our method is equivalent to
that of Umrigar et al.
[17]. However, we believe that
our derivation provides a more rigorous foundation and
shows more explicitly why it works for both the ground
and the excited states.

III. SAMPLE RESULTS FOR IDENTICAL BOSE
ATOMS IN A SYMMETRIC HARMONIC TRAP

The VMVMC, as outlined in Sec. II, was ﬁrst applied
in Ref. [10] to study the universal equation of state at
the van der Waals length scale [8, 9] for few identical
Bose atoms (N = 3-5) in a trap. To better illustrate
and to further test the method, we investigate here the
universal spectrum at the van der Waals length scale for
two identical Bose atoms in a symmetric harmonic trap.
It is a problem for which accurate results can be obtained
independently using a variety of methods [11, 12, 13, 14],
including a multiscale QDT [15, 16].

Two identical Bose atoms in a symmetric harmonic
trap are described by the Hamiltonian, Eqs. (5)-(6), with
N = 2, and

Vext(ri) =

mω2r2

i ,

1
2

(15)

where m is the mass of an atom, and ω is the trap fre-
quency.

For the trap states of interest here, we take the trial

wave function to be of the form of

ΨT = [φ1(r1)φ2(r2) + φ1(r2)φ2(r1)] F (r12) ,

where φ1 and φ2 are independent-particle orbitals, and
F is the atom-atom correlation function that is discussed
in more detail in Ref. [10]. Speciﬁcally, we use

F (r) =

Auλ(r)/r , r < d
(r/d)γ
, r ≥ d

,

(cid:26)

(17)

where u(r) satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation:

(cid:20)

uλ(r) = 0 ,

(18)

for r < d. γ is the parameter characterizing the long-
range correlation between atoms in a trap, with γ = 0
(meaning F = 1 for r > d) corresponding to no long-
range correlation. Both d and γ are taken to be varia-
tional parameters, in addition to the variational param-
eters associated with the descriptions of φ1 and φ2. The
parameters A and λ are not independent. They are deter-
mined by matching F and its derivative at d. Our choice
of F diﬀers from traditional choices (see, e.g. Ref. [6]) not
only in its treatment of the short-range correlation, but
especially in its allowance for the long-range correlation
characterized by parameter γ. This was ﬁrst suggested
by a multiscale QDT treatment of two atoms in a sym-
metric harmonic trap [15, 16], and was later found to be
the key for treating N trapped atoms in cases of strong
coupling, namely when the s wave scattering length a0
becomes comparable to or greater than the trap length
scale aho = (¯h/mω)1/2 [10].

For atoms in their ground state, the atom-atom inter-
action is of the van der Waals type of −Cn/rn with n = 6
at large interatomic separations, i.e.,

v(r) r→∞

−→ −C6/r6 .

(19)

This interaction has an associated length scale of β6 =
(mC6/¯h2)1/4, and a corresponding energy scale of sE =
(¯h2/m)(1/β6)2 [20]. Over a wide range of energies that is
hundreds of sE around the threshold [21, 22], the details
of atomic interactions of shorter range than β6 are not
important, and can be characterized by a single parame-
ter that can be the s wave scattering length a0, the short
range K matrix K c, or some other related parameters
[21, 23, 24]. In this range of energies, the spectrum of
two atoms in a trap follows a universal property that can
be characterized by [10, 15, 16]

Bose atoms in a symmetric harmonic trap as a function of
a0/aho for β6/aho = 0.001. Solid line: results from a multi-
scale QDT [16]. Symbols: results of VMVMC.

As in Ref. [10], the universal spectrum at length scale
β6, namely the Ωi’s in Eq. (20), can be computed by using
a correlation function, Eq. (17), with uλ(r) as given by
the angular-momentum-insensitive quantum-defect the-
ory (AQDT) [21],

uλs(rs) = B[f c(6)

λsl=0(rs) − K cgc(6)

λsl=0(rs)] .

(21)

λsl and gc(6)

Here B is a normalization constant. f c(6)
λsl are
universal AQDT reference functions for −C6/r6 type of
potentials [9, 20]. They depend on r only through a
scaled radius rs = r/β6, and on energy only through a
scaled energy λs = λ/sE. K c is the short-range K matrix
[21] that is related to the s wave scattering length a0 by
[24, 25]

and is called the universal spectrum at length scale β6.
Here Ωi are universal functions that are uniquely deter-
mined by the number of particles, the exponent of the
van der Waals interaction (n = 6), and the exponent
of the trapping potential (2 for the harmonic trap). The
strengths of interactions, characterized by C6 and ω, play
a role only through scaling parameters such as β6 and
aho.

where b = 1/(n − 2), with n = 6.

Figure 1 shows a portion of the universal spectrum at
length scale β6 for two Bose atoms in a symmetric har-
monic trap. Speciﬁcally, it gives the energies of the ﬁrst
three s wave trap states as a function of a0/aho. The cor-
responding φis used in Eq. (16) are independent-particle
orbitals based on standard solutions for a single particle
in a symmetric harmonic potential (see, e.g., [26]). For

rameters are d, γ, α1, and α2 in all three cases. The
variance of energy is calculated according to Sec. II, and
the minimization is carried out using a type of genetic
algorithm.

Both Figs. 1 and 2 show that the results of VMVMC
are in excellent agreements with those of a multiscale
QDT [15, 16], which gives basically exact results for two
atoms in a symmetric harmonic trap. (The scaled energy
per particle, Ei/(2¯hω), used here is related to the scaled
center-of-mass energy, e = ǫ/¯hω, used in Ref. [16], by
Ei/(2¯hω) = (e + 3/2)/2.) The agreements are all within
the variances of energy, which are smaller for weaker cou-
pling (smaller a0/aho) and greater for stronger coupling,

more highly excited states.

but are in any case less than 1.8×10−3 for all parameters
considered. The results shown in Figure 1, which are for
a small β6/aho = 0.001, illustrate the shape-independent
limit of β6/aho → 0 for states with Ei/2 ∼ ¯hω ≪ sE
[10, 16]. They agree, in this limit, with the results ob-
tained using a delta-function pseudopotential [11]. For
greater β6/aho, the eﬀects of the van der Waals inter-
action become gradually more important, especially for
strong coupling (a0/aho ∼ 1 or greater) and for more
highly excited states [12, 16]. This is illustrated in Fig-
ure 3, which compares the results for β6/aho = 0.1 with
those for β6/aho = 0.001. We note that even the low-
est trap state is itself a highly excited diatomic state.
There are other “molecular” states that are lower in en-
ergy [15, 16]. This fact does not, however, lead to any dif-
ﬁculties because VMVMC works the same for the ground
and the excited states. It is for the same reason that we
were able to investigate the gaseous BEC state for few
atoms in a trap [10], which is again a highly excited state.
More detailed discussions of the universal spectrum at
length scale β6 for two atoms in a symmetric harmonic
trap, including the molecular states and the spectra for
nonzero partial waves, can be found elsewhere [16].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

lent agreements with the basically exact results derived
independently from a multiscale QDT [15, 16].

We have presented a variational Monte Carlo method,
VMVMC, that works the same for the excited states as
it does for the ground state. The method is tested here
through the universal spectrum at length scale β6 for two
identical Bose atoms in a symmetry harmonic trap, for
which the results from VMVMC are found to be in excel-

The analytic and numerical examples for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional harmonic
and anharmonic oscillators, and potential wells, show that median values of these peaks for
approximate G(E; 0, 0) corresponds with accuracy of order 10% to the exact values of even
levels already in the lowest orders of approximation n = 1 and n = 2, i.e. when the path
integral is replaced by a line or double integral. The weights of the peaks approximate the
values of the squared modulus of the wave functions at x = 0 with the same accuracy. The
accuracy depends on the type of the paths used.

Introduction

Continual (functional) integrals, or path integrals, introduced to quantum mechanics by R.Feyn-
man [1, 2], are widely used for constructing series in perturbation theory, for ﬁnding quasi-
classical asymptotes, for quantizing gauge ﬁelds [3]–[7]. Mathematical questions of the functional
integral theory are discussed in [8, 9]. Path integrals combined with Monte-Carlo technique are
being used for solving problems of quark conﬁnement [10]-[12].

However, the question of applying path integral approximations to problems of practical
computations of quantum system spectra remains virtually unexplored. First, not very success-
ful, attempts of this kind are described by Kac[13]. An example of computation for a system
of two particles sitting in a potential well is considered in [14]. Among more recent papers it
is worth noting the work [15], where an estimate for the ground level from below is obtained
with a help of path integral. Papers [13]-[15] employ “Wick rotation” and they allow obtaining
information only about the ground level, moreover, for some examples considered in [13] the
results disagree with exact values by a factor more than two. It seems that path integrals were
applied for global spectrum analysis in quasi-classical limit only [16]-[18]. It remains unclear if
approximations to path integrals can have a practical value for calculations of the Schr¨odinger
equation spectra. To clarify the situation, it seems appropriate to begin with simplest quantum
systems and to investigate the inﬂuence of the path types and of the order of approximations
on the results.

Here we suggest the following approach to ﬁnding the energy levels Ej of a quantum sys-
tem with the help of path integrals. The kernel of evolution operator
(xb, T ; xa, 0) (i.e. the
time-dependent Green function) can be expressed via eigenfunctions Ψj(x) of the Schr¨odinger
equation:

The expression (13) is valid also as an approximation of the n-th order of a general Green
xn+1 = xb in (10), and functions fℓ in (12) and (14)

function G(E; xa, xb). Then x0 = xa,
depend both on xa and xb.

must reﬂect the degree of the level degeneracy.

3.1 Harmonic oscillator

In case of evenly symmetric potentials, U (q) = U (

q), for odd levels, the wavefunctions
vanish at q = 0, ψj(0) = 0, therefore, according to (2) maxima of the r.h.s. of expression (22)
must correspond only to even energy levels E′j for j = 0, 2, 4, . . .. Those exact values are shown
by arrows in Fig.1 where the dependence of R1F and R1s on E′ is plotted according to (22).

Figure 1: Dependencies R1ℓ(E′) for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator (21). Solid ℓ = s,
dashed ℓ = F . The exact energy values of even levels are shown by arrows.

One can see that the dependence R1ℓ(E′) has clear peaks located in correspondence with
the levels of the oscillator. E.g., for expansion over sines (5s) the location of the ﬁrst maximum
deviates from the exact value of the ground level by less than 15%.

The behavior of Rnℓ(E′) (which is proportional to

) must reﬂect the properties
of a sum of δ-functions. The location of a δ-function is determined by an integral relation.
Therefore it is more natural to expect that a level corresponds not to a maximum of Rnℓ(E′),
but to an average of the integral (i.e. a median value) of Rnℓ(E′) between two minima of the
dependence Rnℓ(E′). We call this median value a median of the peak, and the area under the
between two adjacent minima of Rnℓ(E′) will be called a weight of the peak.

i.e. maxima and medians of the peaks R1F (E′) are at E′j = (π2/√3)(j + 1/2)), and of R1s(E′)
at E′j = 2π(j + 1/2), for large even j. Thus, medians of peaks of R1s(E′) coincide with exact
1, while the expansion over broken lines gives a spectrum
values of oscillator levels for E′ ≫
which is qualitatively correct, but with a relative error
10% (approximately the same as for
the ground level).

∼

With account of the coeﬃcient B1s in (13), we obtain from (22) for ℓ = s that the weight
of the peak of the ground level is equal to 1.776(¯hmω)1/2. This diﬀers from the exact value,
2 = (π¯hmω)1/2, by less than 1%.

Now let us turn to approximations of the second order (n = 2). The results of numerical
calculations of R2F (E′) and R2s(E′) based on the formula (20) are shown in Fig.2. For n = 1 the
graphs of R1F (E′) and R1s(E′) were similar to each other, but now we see a drastic diﬀerence in
the behavior of R2ℓ(E′). The function R2F (E′), built with the use of broken paths, has “false”
maxima, while R2s(E′) demonstrates quite a regular behavior showing a tendency to a sum of
δ-functions.

It is likely that good results obtained with the paths (5s) for n = 2 are due to the fact that
they are optimum for approximations of path integrals over the Wiener measure [20, 21]. For
other potentials, e.g.
for a box with reﬂecting walls, the behavior of the function RnF (E′) is
quite regular (see below) and it has no “false” maxima. Hence, the system of optimum functions
should depend on the shape of the potential well.

3.3 Inﬂuence of continuum spectrum

Above are considered the examples of potentials for which there exists only a discrete spectrum of
eigenvalues of energy. For continuum spectrum the relation (2) is not applicable. It is therefore
seems interesting to consider a well of ﬁnite depth, since this problem has both discrete and
continuum ranges of a particle spectrum.

In a well with the potential

ϕ(q) =

1/2 in Eq.(8), already the ﬁrst order of approximation using
for distance unit a = π−
sinusoidal paths provides a reasonable accuracy. Plots of R1s(E′) for various values of γ are
presented in Fig.4. One can observe the growth of the number of bound levels E′n < 0 with

It is important that not only approximations for ground levels are in good agreement with
exact values [since for small q the potential (28) tends to a harmonic oscillator potential], but
there is also a correct description of intermediate levels. The uppermost levels feel the inﬂuence
of continuum. We get from (18) for n = 1 an asymptote for E′ → −

4 Conclusions

The numerical experiments and analytical examples considered in this work allow us to draw
some conclusions.

1. Replacing a path integral by its approximation with an integral of ﬁnite dimensionality
may be an eﬀective means for computing spectra of multi-dimensional quantum systems.
It is remarkable that qualitatively, and even quantitatively (with accuracy
10%), cor-
2 can be obtained already with
rect information on the energy levels and on values of
|
approximations of low order, n = 1, 2, that is with a small amount of computing.

2. Our preliminary computations, using Korobov numerical quadrature for n up to n = 16,

show that the accuracy of method grows not faster than n−

1/2.

3. It would be interesting to generalize the method for the case of many-body systems with
account of particle statistics, probably with the help of Monte-Carlo methods, and also to
apply this technique for computations of thermodynamic functions of non-ideal systems.

Addendum

The text above is almost a literal translation of a Russian ITEP preprint 111-82. Only a few misprints
are corrected and a well known formula for En in modiﬁed P¨oschl-Teller potential [a] is added after (28).
During the two decades, that passed after the preprint was circulated, there appeared many papers on
the subject of numerical applications of path integrals. Yet it seems that our results are still interesting
because the technique of numerical analysis that we have undertaken, namely, using our formulae (18)
and (19), was not explored by other workers for obtaining information on excited levels. Moreover, we
found that the lowest orders in (18) and (19) are suﬃcient for obtaining reasonable results. Thus, this
direction of research is still promising.

Some historical references, missing in our text, are added below [a-e], as well as references to relevant

papers [f-v] published after this report was issued in 1982.

We thank Andrei Smilga for discussions that stimulated the translation of this paper into English
and its posting in arXiv. S.B. is very grateful to H.Takabe for his kind hospitality at ILE, Osaka, where
a major part of this version of the paper has been prepared, and to V.Zhakhovskii for useful hints on
recent literature.

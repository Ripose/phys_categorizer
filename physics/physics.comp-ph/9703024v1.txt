Abstract

We analyze the structure of the periodic trajectories of the K-system gen-
erator of pseudorandom numbers on a rational sublattice which coincides with
the Galois ﬁeld GF [p]. The period of the trajectories increases as a function
of the lattice size p and the dimension of the K-matrix d. We emphasize the
connection of this approach with the one which is based on primitive matrices
over Galois ﬁelds.

1 Introduction

Nowadays the Monte-Carlo method has a wide range of applications and the quality
of pseudorandom numbers being used plays an important role. Diﬀerent principles
and algorithms have been suggested in the literature to generate pseoudorandom
numbers and to check their properties [1]. The development of the ergodic theory
[2, 3, 4, 5] and the progress in understanding of nonlinear phenomena together with
the increasing power of modern computers open a new era for applications [7, 8, 9].
In the articles [10] the authors suggested to use many-dimensional Kolmogorov
K-systems to generate pseudorandom numbers of high quality. K-systems are the
most stochastic dynamical systems, with nonzero Kolmogorov entropy and their
trajectories are exponentially unstable and uniformly ﬁll the phase space [2, 3, 6, 12,
13, 10]. It was suggested to use the coordinates of these trajectories as a sequence of
pseudorandom numbers [10]. From this point of view the most successful inversive
congruential generator [1] used so far can be considered as a one-dimensional K-
system and it was pointed out that this fact explains its exceptional properties [10].
For the application of this idea it is important to have such K-systems for which
the phase space is limited by a unit d-dimensional torus, because in that case the
coordinates of the trajectories can be used directly without any additional trans-
formations. Two types of K-systems have been suggested for these purposes: toral
automorphisms [10, 11] and many-dimensional Sinai billiard which is deﬁned inside
a unit d-dimensional torus [14].

In the case of toral automorphisms a unit d-dimensional torus Πd plays the role of
a phase space and the K-system is represented by a d-dimensional matrix - K-matrix
- which acts on the vectors from Πd generating trajectories uniformly distributed
over the torus Πd. The coordinates of these trajectories are used for Monte-Caro
simulations [10, 11]. The properties of this new class of matrix generators were
investigated by diﬀerent criterion including Kolmogorov discrepancy DN .
In all
cases it shows good statistical properties [11].

The aim of this article is to estimate the period of the trajectories which are
used to produce pseudorandom numbers generated by a K-system. It is clear, that
only periodic trajectories of K-systems can be simulated on a computer, because
trajectories on a computer are always on a ﬁnite rational sublattice Z d
p of the phase
space Πd. Thus we have to consider the system on rational sublattice Z d
p of a unit d-
dimensional torus and particularly on sublattices with prime basis p [23, 24, 25, 27,
26, 36, 32, 28]. These sublattices are equivalent to Galois ﬁelds GF [p] and all four
elementary arithmetical operations can be carried out unrestrictevely [21, 20, 22].

Analyzing trajectories of a K-system on a Galois sublattice GF [p] one can see
that in order to have trajectories with large period K-matrix should have an eigen-
values in high extensions GF [ d√p] of the ﬁeld (notation used in mathematical litera-
ture is GF [pd]). This property makes them very close to so called primitive matrices
which have been considered by Niedereiter [16, 17] to generate pseoudorandom num-
bers. We refer to the book of Niederreiter [19] and to the survey article [18] for recent
references. The main idea of his approach is to use a primitive matrices on a given
Galois ﬁeld GF [ d√p] to generate pseudorandom numbers of very large periods. This
approach guarantees the large period of the series. In addition the fascinating result
of Niedereiter [18] allows to estimate the uniformity of maximally long trajectories

in terms of Kolmogorov discrepancy DN .

Thus these two approaches are very close to each other on Galois sublattices
and the main question is: whether one can have the matrices with both properties
at the same time? The determinant of a K-matrix should be equal to one while
the determinant of a primitive matrix is diﬀerent from one, thus these properties are
incompatible. The main point, which we would like to stress here, is that nevertheless
one can construct K-matrices which have a primitive matrix as submatrices. In that
case the trajectories are still very long as in the case of primitive matrices, but at
the expense of appearance of trajectories with short period. Excluding them from
initial data we guarantee that the trajectories are maximally long and at the same
time belong to a K-system. We suggest speciﬁc matrices with these properties which
can be used for practical simulations.

2 Trajectories of K-system on a rational sublat-

tice

Let us pass to the details of the algorithm. The matrix generator is deﬁned as

d ) is an initial real vector. The last condition provides
phase-space volume conservation. The automorphism (1) forms the K-system of
Anosov if and only if all eigenvalues of the matrix A are in modulus diﬀerent from
unity [3, 4, 5]

This approach allows a large freedom in choosing the matrices A for the K-system
generators and the initial vectors [10]. Speciﬁc choices suggested in [10, 11, 35] are

Let us consider trajectories of the system (1) with an initial vector X (0) which

has rational coordinates [23, 24, 25, 27, 26, 32, 28]

X (0) = (

).

(5)

It is easy to see, that all these trajectories are periodic orbits of the Anosov map
(1), because matrix elements ai,j are integer. Indeed, if we consider the sublattice
of unit torus Πd with rational coordinates of the form q/p where p is the least
common multiple of p’s

X = (

q1

,

q2

then the multiplication,summation and (mod) operations (1) will leave the trajectory
on the same sublattice. The total number of vertices on this sublattice Z d

p is

(total number of verteces) = pd,

therefore the period τp of the trajectories on Z d
is always less than pd

Thus the periodic trajectories of this system (1) with the initial vector (5) coincide
with a subset of the points of rational sublattice Z d
p and our goal is to ﬁnd conditions
under which the period of the K-system will be as large as possible.

Let us show that on every given sublattice Z d

p Anosov map (1) reduces to (mod

p) arithmetic. Indeed on sublattice Z d

p the Anosov map A (1) can be written as

and is equivalent to (mod p) arithmetic on the lattice with integer coordinates qi
which are in the interval [0, p

Thus the images of the periodic trajectories on a unit torus Πd appear as trajectories
on the integer sublattice Z d
p and all operations can be understood (mod p). The
most important thing is that now all operations become commutative.

To estimate the period of the trajectories on a rational sublattice it is essential
to consider those sublattices for which p is the prime number, we mean that p1 =
... = pd = p [23, 24, 25, 27, 26, 32, 28]. In that case the integer sublattice gains an
additional structure and becomes the Galois ﬁeld GF [p] and all operations reduce
to arithmetic ones on Galois ﬁeld. The beneﬁt to work on Galois ﬁeld is that four
arithmetic operations are well deﬁned on that sublattice [21].

In this way we can consider every coordinate qi , i = 1, ..., d as belonging to
, where p is a prime number and consider the

As we already mentioned, this reduction of a dynamical system (1) to a dynam-

operations commutative in the sense that

This equation allows to understand the relation between eigenvalues of the matrix
A and the period of the trajectories. Indeed let us consider the eigenvalue problem
for the matrix A on a Galois sublattice

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

then the period of the given trajectory τp can be understood as a degree of power
on which the λ reduces to identity (mod p)

A X = λ X,

λτp = 1

(mod p).

The period of the trajectory on a Galois sublattice GF [p] is equal therefore to the
power τp in which the eigenvalue of the matrix A reduces to identity. It is obvious
that the same matrix A will have diﬀerent periods on diﬀerent Galois ﬁelds and that
this period depends on the given prime number p,the dimension of matrices d and
the initial vector X0.

3 Eigenvalues of the generator and the period of

the trajectories

Thus the actual value of the period τp naturally depends on the form of eigenvalues
λ and of the prime number p. Here we can distinguish diﬀerent cases:

i). The eigenvalue λ coincides with one of the elements of the Galois ﬁeld GF [p].
In that case the period τp depends on the fact whether eigenvalue coincides with a
primitive element of the Galois ﬁeld. All elements of the ﬁeld GF [p] can be con-
structed as powers of primitive element g and gp−1 = 1. If the eigenvalue coincides
with the primitive element of the Galois ﬁeld ,

λ = g,

where g is a primitive element of GF [p],

then the period is maximal and is equal to τp = p

1

−

λp−1 = 1,

(mod p).

Therefore to get the maximal period in the case i) one should have an eigenvalue
equal to the primitive element g. If λ does not coincide with the primitive element
g, then the period is simply smaller and is equal to (p
1)/m where m is a divisor
of p

−

1.

−

ii). The eigenvalue does not coincide with any element of the Galois ﬁeld GF [p].
This may happen because Galois ﬁeld is arithmetically complete, but it is not al-
gebraically complete, therefore one can have the situation when the solution of the
characteristic polynomial of the K-matrix is not in the ﬁeld GF [p]. In that case one
should ask, whether it is an element of the quadratic extension GF [√p] or of higher
extensions. The quadratic extension of the Galois ﬁeld consists of the numbers of
the form a+b√g where a, b are the elements of ﬁeld GF [p], g is the primitive element

of GF [p] and √g is a square-free integer. The primitive element of the GF [√p] has
the period equal to p2

1 [21].

Thus if the eigenvalue is an element of the quadratic extension and coincides

−

with its primitive element h

λ = h,

where h = h1 + h2√g

is a primitive element of GF [√p],

(10)

then the period is equal to τp = p2

1

−
λp2−1 = 1,

(mod p).

(11)

iii). In general the characteristic polynomial of the K-matrix is of order d and the
eigenvalue may belong to high extensions GF [ d√p] of the Galois ﬁeld. The elements
of GF [ d√p] have the form a + bh + ... + ehd−1 where a, b, ..., e are the elements of
GF [p] and h is a primitive element of GF [ d√p] [20, 21, 22].
If the eigenvalue λ
coincides with this primitive element

λ = h where h is a primitive element of GF [ d√p],

(12)

then the period is equal to τp = pd

1 [20, 21, 22]

−

λpd−1 = 1,

(mod p).

(13)

This analysis demonstrates an important fact that in order to have a large period
on a sublattice GF [p] one should have K-matrices with eigenvalues in high extensions
of the ﬁeld.

4 Generators with largest period

In the previous sections we described the trajectories of the K-system on the rational
sublattice Z d
p and particularly on a Galois ﬁeld, that is when p is a prime number.
We have seen that the period of the trajectories depends on the ”order” of the
corresponding eigenvalue and the period is as large as the order of the extension
of the ﬁeld to which belongs the eigenvalue. The question is: can we construct a
K-matrices with eigenvalues in high extensions of the Galois ﬁeld and how many of
them can simultaneously belong to a maximal extension GF [ d√p] ?

We should remark that the d-dimensional matrices A with all eigenvalues in
GF [ d√p] are well known in number theory and correspond to so called primitive
matrices of the ﬁeld GF [ d√p] and the determinant of primitive matrices is not equal
to one [20, 21, 22]. Therefore the K-matrices which have the determinant equal to
one can not coincide with the primitive matrices, but as we will see one can construct
1 eigenvalues in GF [ d√p] and only one in GF [p]. This means
K-matrices with d
that most of the trajectories will have the maximal period τp = pd
1 and only few
of them (corresponding to that exceptional eigenvalue) will have smaller period and
we should exclude them from initial data.

−

First let us construct the K-matrices which have the eigenvalues in quadratic

extension GF [√p]. If h is the primitive element of the GF [√p], that is

h = h1 + h2√g,

h

h⋆ = g,

h + h⋆ = 2h1,

·
then the matrix which has the eigenvalues in GF [√p] can be constructed in the form
of (4)

and has two roots in GF [√p] and one root in GF [p]. The period of the most
trajectories is equal to

τp = p2

1.

−

(17)

and is quadratic in p. At the same time the trajectories with the initial vector
g− are smaller and one should exclude them from
corresponding to eigenvalue λ =
initial data.
It is also easy to see that if we want to construct two-dimensional
K-matrices with eigenvalues only in GF [√p] we face the problem with determinant
Det A = h
= 1. This observation explains why two-dimensional K-systems,
like Arnold cat, can not have periodic trajectories of the length p2
1 on any Galois
sublattice.

h⋆ = g

−

−

·

To construct a K-matrix generator with eigenvalues in high ﬁeld GF [ d√p] we will
use primitive polynomial of degree d over GF [ d√p]. The primitive polynomial has
the form [21, 20, 22]

λd + β1λd−1 + β2λd−2 + ... + βd = 0
with coeﬃcients β1, β2, ..., βd over GF [p]. The roots of this characteristic polynomial
coincide with diﬀerent powers of a primitive element h (12) of GF [ d√p]

(18)

λ2 = hp,

λ1 = h,

...
If pd
1 is not divisible by p, p2, ..., pd−1, then all of them are primitive elements
of GF [ d√p]. This is the reason why this polynomial is called ”primitive”. There are
two equivalent representations of h:
i) in the form of root of the polynomial (18)
and ii) in the form of corresponding matrix [21, 20, 22]

As we already explained the problem is that the primitive polynomial (18) and the
corresponding primitive matrix (19) do not have determinant equal to one, because
βd
= 1. But this property is incompatible with K-condition (2). The exceptional
case is only GF [2] .

Nevertheless one can solve this problem as follows: the last term βd which is equal
to the determinant of the primitive matrix coincides with the primitive element g
of GF [p] βd = g, therefore if we multiply the primitive polynomial (18) by λ + g−
we will get the polynomial

(λ + g−)(λd + β1λd−1 + β2λd−2 + ... + βd) =
λd+1 + (β1 + g−)λd + (β2 + β1g−)λd−1 + ... + 1 = 0.

Tables of primitive polynomials with large values of d are available [20].

d < 1001 with the corresponding periods of order 21000.

4.1 Conclusion

In this article we advocate two approaches to generate pseoudorandom numbers of
high quality: i) the ﬁrst one is based on K-system generators with their exponentially
unstable trajectories uniformly ﬁlling the phase space and ii) on primitive matrices
acting on a given Galois sublattice with their maximally long trajectories. We
demonstrate that one can combine these properties in a unique K-matrix which has
primitive matrix as a submatrix. This construction guarantees that the trajectories
belong to a K-system and at the same time have maximally large periods.

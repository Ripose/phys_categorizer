We introduce a straightforward, single-simulation, path sampling approach to calculate free energy
diﬀerences based on Jarzynski’s relation. In test systems, the new (minimally optimized) method
performs roughly one hundred times faster than optimized “traditional” Jarzynski calculations.
The simplicity of the underlying formalism suggests the approach will ﬁnd broad applicability in
molecular systems.

The estimation of free energy diﬀerences ∆F in molecular systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] is important for a wide
variety of applications including virtual screening for drug design, determination of the solubility of small molecules,
and binding aﬃnities of ligands to proteins [10, 11]. Jarzynski recently introduced a general non-equilibrium approach
to computing ∆F [6, 12], but the technique never has been shown superior to more traditional equilibrium calculations
(e.g. [5, 7]). Here, we introduce a potential route for dramatically faster non-equilibrium ∆F calculations.

Many previous workers have attempted to improve non-equilibrium ∆F estimates. Hummer studied the opti-
mization of non-equilibrium simulation [7], and Jarzynski introduced “targeted free energy perturbation” to improve
conﬁgurational sampling [13]. Improvement of conﬁgurational sampling has also been the focus of studies by Mc-
Cammon and collaborators [5], Karplus and collaborators [14] and van Gunsteren and collaborators [4]. Schulten
and collaborators used Jarzynski’s approach for steered molecular dynamics simulations [8]. Ytreberg and Zuckerman
[15], and Zuckerman and Woolf [1, 16] have developed methods for more eﬃcient use of non-equilibrium data for ∆F
calculation.

In an important advance of direct relevance to the present report, Sun suggested the use of a path sampling approach
to evaluate ∆F via Jarzynski’s relation, with a formalism that essentially entails thermodynamic integration in
(inverse) temperature space [3]. Sun reported impressive eﬃciency gains. However, multiple path sampling simulations
were required even for simple systems.

The approach outlined below requires only a single path sampling simulation and estimates ∆F eﬃciently via
a simple formalism.
It builds on several sources. Jarzynski deﬁned the non-equilibrium approach [6], and Pratt
introduced the seminal concept of sampling dynamic paths with equilibrium tools [17]. Chandler and collaborators
supplied Monte Carlo path sampling moves for eﬀective implementation of the Pratt approach [18, 19, 20], and Sun
suggested that path sampling ensembles could be used to evaluate the Jarzynski relation [3]. Finally, Zuckerman
and Woolf employed a direct formalism for path-based estimates of arbitrary quantities, which is key to our single-
simulation protocol [21].

In outline, this report ﬁrst sketches Jarzynski’s relation and shows how it can be re-written using importance
sampling of paths. The path sampling procedure used in our method is then described. The resulting method,
although not fully optimized, produces ∆F estimates roughly 100× more eﬃciently than the optimized Jarzynski
method for the two-dimensional test system considered here.

Following the usual formalism to deﬁne the ∆F calculation, we consider two systems or distinct states that are
deﬁned by Hamiltonians H0(~x) and H1(~x), where ~x is a set of conﬁgurational coordinates. By introducing a parameter
λ, a hybrid Hamiltonian can be constructed

H(λ; ~x) = H0(~x) + λ
h
Jarzynski showed that arbitrarily rapid, non-equilibrium switches from λ = 0 to λ = 1 can be used to calculate the
equilibrium free energy diﬀerence ∆F = ∆Fλ=0→1. To this end, one considers switching trajectories that combine
increments in λ with “traditional” dynamics (such as Monte Carlo or Langevin dynamics) in ~x-space at ﬁxed λ values.
Thus, a trajectory with n λ-steps is denoted by

H1(~x) − H0(~x)

,

(2)

where it should be noted that incremements from λi to λi+1 are performed at a ﬁxed conformation ~xi, and the initial
~x0 is drawn from the H0 distribution. For simplicity we have assumed only a single dynamics step at ﬁxed λi, from
~xi−1 to ~xi, is performed, but multiple steps can be performed within the Jarzysnki formalism.

overdamped Langevin case.

R

In “standard” non-equilibrium simulation, the integral over all trajectories in Eq. (4) need never be considered since
trajectories, and the associated work values, are automatically generated with the proper frequency (i.e., proportional
to Q(Zn)). In this case, the Jarzynski relation provides an estimate for ∆F for a set of work values {W1, W2, ..., WN }

where the “
=” denotes a computational estimate. Since the relationship in Eq. (4) is valid for an arbitrary number n
of λ-steps, switches may be performed very rapidly. The apparent advantage of these “fast-growth” (small n) methods
is that very little computational time is spent generating trajectories, and thus ∆FJarz can be generated with very
little CPU time. However, in practice, unless there is suﬃcient overlap between the states described by H0(~x) and
H1(~x), ∆FJarz will be biased, often by many kBT [4, 5, 13]. This bias is due to the nonlinear nature of Eq. (5)
where the smallest, and thus rarest, work values dominate the average. Additionally, CPU time must be invested in
generating the equilibrium distribution for H0.

This study uses importance sampling of switching trajectories to sample dominant but rare work values more
frequently, without the need to sample the H0 equilibrium distribution. We combine the sampling strategy of Sun [3]
with the simple formalism used by Zuckerman and Woolf [21], as we consider an alternative distribution of switching
trajectories D(Zn). Then, with no loss of generality, Eq. (4) can be written as

Since the fundamental idea behind the importance sampling in Eq. (6) is to generate trajectories – and hence work
values – according to D(Zn), the choice D is critical. We choose D(Zn) to favor trajectories with important work
values, namely,

D(Zn) = Q(Zn)e

As will be seen below in Eq. (8), this choice appears to balance convergence diﬃculties between the numerator and
denominator of Eq. (6). We note that Sun also employed the distribution (7) as one among several used for an indirect
calculation of ∆F . While it is not obvious that the choice (7) is optimal in general, other forms for D(Zn) have been
tested by the authors and provided no improvement over Eq. (7). Equation (7) also posseses characteristics of a higher
temperature system.

Combining Eqs. (6) and (7), the free energy estimate for our single-simulation path sampling (SSPS) method is

given by the new relation

We have compared ∆Fssps as given by Eq. (8) to ∆FJarz given by Eq. (5), and have found that, for all the systems
we have considered, ∆Fssps is remarkably more eﬃcient than ∆FJarz.

change of 4.0 kBT . Also shown are proﬁles of H0(x, 0) and H1(x, 0) which demonstrate that this problem is expected to be
diﬃcult due to the large barrier height and the asymetric double-well.

We now specify Q(Zn) from Eq. (8) which is required for the path sampling performed below. We assume over-
damped Langevin (Brownian) dynamics are in eﬀect at ﬁxed λ values during the switching trajectories. Single-step
distributions for ∆~xi = ~xi − ~xi−1 are thus Gaussian, with a variance given by σ2 = 2∆t/mγβ, where m is the mass
of the particle and γ is the friction coeﬃcient of the medium (e.g. [21]). Combining the Brownian distributions with
that for λ = 0 leads to the full trajectory weight

To calculate the free energy estimate ∆Fssps in Eq. (8) switching trajectories must be generated according to D(Zn).
This is readily accomplished using the path sampling approach proposed by Pratt [17], where entire trajectories (paths)
are generated and then accepted or rejected based upon a suitable Monte Carlo criteria. Trial moves in path space
are generated following Chandler and coworkers [18, 19].

Putting the pieces together, we estimate ∆F in a single simulation, by sampling trajectories according to D(Zn)

in Eq. (7) using the following steps (c.f. [3]):

1. Generate an arbitrary intial reference trajectory by switching the system from λ = 0 → 1. Calculate the work

W done on the system during the switch.

2. Pick a random λ value along the reference trajectory and make a random phase-space displacement. For
Brownian dynamics this corresponds to a random shift in position. Generate a trial trajectory by “shooting”
forward (increment λ) and backward (decrement λ). Calculate the trial work done on the system W ′.

3. Accept this new trajectory according to the Metropolis criteria; min

4. If accepted, the trial trajectory becomes the current reference trajectory.

If rejected, the current reference
trajectory remains unchanged. Whether accepted or rejected, the current reference trajectory is then used in
Eq. (8). Repeat from step 2.

It should be noted that to obtain good sampling, as in any Monte Carlo simulation, equilibrium must be attained
before averages are calculated. Using the path sampling procedure above, we accomplish this by checking the running
average work every 20 accepted trajectories. Once the running average work was converged to within 0.01 kBT ,
trajectories were used to calculate ∆Fssps using Eq. (8). Equilibration time is included in the total CPU time to
gauge the eﬃciency of the SSPS method.

FIG. 2: Comparison between free energy estimates from the Jarzynski method ∆FJarz given by Eq. (5) and estimates from
our importance sampling path sampling (SSPS) method ∆Fssps given by Eq. (8). The blue circles show the results of the SSPS
method using 10 λ-steps. The results of the Jarzynski method for 10 (red squares), 1,000 (green diamonds) and 100,000 (violet
triangles) λ-steps are also shown. The exact answer of ∆F = 6.5 kBT is shown as a solid black line. Each data point represents
the mean estimate, with standard deviations given by the error bars, based on 200 independent estimates of ∆FJarz and ∆Fssps.

To demonstrate the eﬃciency of the SSPS method, consider a two-dimensional problem where the system is switched

from a single-well to a double-well:

H1(x, y) =

((x − 1)2 − y2)2 + 10(x2 − 5)2 + (x + y)4 + (x − y)4

H0(x, y) and H1(x, y) are shown as contour plots in Fig. 1 with each contour representing an energy change of 4.0 kBT .
The y = 0 proﬁles of both potentials, also in Fig. 1, clearly demonstrate why estimating ∆F for this system is expected
to be diﬃcult: the signiﬁcant barrier height in H1 will prevent suﬃcient conﬁgurational sampling of the minimum at
H1(2, 0) for short trajectories. Thus ordinary fast-growth Jarzysnki estimates will substantially overestimate ∆F .

For this system, the free energy diﬀerence was estimated using the Jarzysnki method given by ∆FJarz in Eq. (5),
and the SSPS method given by ∆Fssps in Eq. (8). Trajectories for both estimates were generated using Brownian
dynamics with parameters chosen as β = γ = m = 1, and time step ∆t = 0.001.

Trajectories for ∆FJarz were generated by switching the system from λ = 0 → 1 with uncorrelated initial conditions
drawn from the equililibrium ensemble for λ = 0. In practice, this implies that for each work value generated, the
system must run at λ = 0 for Neq steps. For the system of Eq. (10) it was determined that Neq = 10, 000, and that
smaller values of Neq introduce bias in ∆FJarz. Given Neq, moreover, we optimized ∆FJarz by varying the number n
of λ-steps in Eqs. (2) and (3). Ironically, this optimization required knowledge of the answer.

Trajectories for ∆Fssps were generated by the path sampling procedure described above. Speciﬁcally, perturbations
to the selected state ~xi of the reference trajectory (step 2 of the path sampling procedure above) were chosen from a
Gaussian distribution of width 50.0σ, giving an acceptance ratio of 1 − 2%. The SSPS procedure is not optimized in
the sense that only a simple type of trial move (termed “shooting” [19]) was employed, and we used strict equilibration
criteria. Optimization methods are currently under investigation by the authors.

Despite the lack of optimization of the SSPS method, ∆Fssps oﬀers remarkable improvement over the optimized
Jarzysnki method estimates ∆FJarz. To compare the eﬃciency of the SSPS and Jarzynski methods, in Fig. 2 we plot
∆F estimates for the SSPS and Jarzynski methods as a function of the total CPU time needed generate the estimates.

5

The blue circles show the results of the SSPS method using 10 λ-steps. Also shown are the results of the Jarzynski
method using 10 (red squares), 1,000 (green diamonds) and 100,000 (violet triangles) λ-steps. The solid black line
gives the exact answer ∆F = 6.5 kBT . The plot was generated by calculating the mean (data points) and standard
deviations (error bars) from 200 independent estimates of ∆FJarz and ∆Fssps. The CPU time spent equilibrating is
included in the total CPU time for both methods.

As expected, Fig. 2 shows that for fast-growth work values (10 λ-steps, red squares), the Jarzysnki method incor-
rectly estimates the free energy diﬀerence as ∆FJarz ≈ 13 kBT . As the number of λ-steps increases, the standard
Jarzynski trajectories begin to “see” the minimum at H1(2, 0) and the correct ∆F is obtained. It should be noted
that increasing the number of λ-steps beyond 100,000 does not increase the eﬃciency of the Jarzysnki method for
this system.

The SSPS method, by contrast, correctly estimates the free energy quickly and accurately, even for very short
trajectories (10 λ-steps). One can quantitatively compare ∆Fssps and ∆FJarz by noting that the estimate for the
SSPS method ∆Fssps(t ≈ 500 s) is slightly more accurate than ∆FJarz(t ≈ 50, 000 s), implying a more than 100-fold
speed-up.

The eﬃciency improvement of the SSPS method over the “standard” Jarzynski method for fast-growth work values
can be understood from the following comparison: (a) The Jarzysnki method relies on rare trajectories with small
work values; the SSPS method, by design, generates trajectories, and thus work values, that are more important to
the free energy estimate; (b) For the Jarzysnki method, a large percentage of CPU time is devoted to generating the
λ = 0 equilibrium ensemble; the SSPS does not require an equilibrium ensemble at any ﬁxed λ, since new trajectories
are generated from existing trajectories.

To summarize, we have described a rapid and straightforward new method for estimating free energy diﬀerences
∆F , using a single path sampling simulation (SSPS). We also have carefully quantiﬁed the numerical eﬃciency of
the approach. Without extensive optimization, the SSPS method generates ∆F estimates over 100× more eﬃciently
than “standard” Jarzynski calculations for the two-dimensional test system considered here. Our approach relies on
an extremely simple importance sampling formalism, and therefore appears to be readily extendable to molecular
systems. This extension is currently underway.

Future work includes comparison to equilibrium approaches such as thermodynamic integration, and also optimiza-
tion of the SSPS method. Possible improvements include alternative importance sampling distributions, diﬀerent
trajectory-generating procedures, and optimization of the trajectory acceptance ratio.

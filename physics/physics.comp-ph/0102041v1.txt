Abstract

The general conditions under which the quadratic, uniform and monotonic

convergence in the quasilinearization method could be proved are formulated

and elaborated. The method, whose mathematical basis in physics was dis-

cussed recently by one of the present authors (VBM), approximates the so-

lution of a nonlinear diﬀerential equation by treating the nonlinear terms as

a perturbation about the linear ones, and unlike perturbation theories is not

based on the existence of some kind of a small parameter.

It is shown that the quasilinearization method gives excellent results when

applied to diﬃcult nonlinear diﬀerential equations in physics, such as the Bla-

sius, Duﬃng, Lane-Emden and Thomas-Fermi equations. The ﬁrst few quasi-

linear iterations already provide extremely accurate and numerically stable

answers.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a series of recent papers, [1,2] the possibility of applying a very powerful approxima-

tion technique called the quasilinearization method (QLM) to physical problems has been

discussed. The QLM is designed to confront the nonlinear aspects of physical processes. The

method, whose iterations are constructed to yield rapid convergence and often monotonicity,

was introduced years ago by Bellman and Kalaba [3,4] to solve individual or systems of non-

linear ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations. Modern developments and applications of

the QLM to diﬀerent ﬁelds are given in a monograph [5].

However, the QLM was never systematically studied or extensively applied in physics,

although references to it can be found in well known monographs [6,7] dealing with the

variable phase approach to potential scattering, as well as in a few scattered research papers

[8–11]. The reason for the sparse use of the QLM in Physics is that the convergence of

the method has been proven only under rather restrictive conditions [3,4], which generally

are not fulﬁlled in physical applications. Recently, though, it was shown [1] by one of the

present authors (VBM) that a diﬀerent proof of the convergence can be provided which we

will generalize and elaborate here so that the applicability of the method is extended to

incorporate realistic physical conditions of forces deﬁned on inﬁnite intervals with possible

singularities at certain points.

In the ﬁrst paper of the series [1], the quasilinearization approach was applied to the

nonlinear Calogero equation in a variable phase approach to quantum mechanics and the

results were compared with those of perturbation theory and the exact solutions. It was

found analytically and by examples that the n-th approximation of the QLM exactly sums

2n

−

1 terms of perturbation theory. In addition, a similar number of terms is reproduced

approximately. The number of the exactly reproduced perturbation terms thus doubles with

each subsequent QLM approximation, and reaches, for example, 127 terms in the 6-th QLM

approximation, 8191 terms in the 12-th QLM approximation, and so on.

The computational approach in the work [1] was mostly analytical, and therefore one

2

was able to compute only two to three QLM iterations, mainly for power potentials. Only in

the case of the 1/r2 potential, could the calculation of QLM iterations be done analytically

for any n.

The goal of the next work [2] was, by dropping the restriction of analytical computation,

to calculate higher iterations as well as to extend the analysis to non-power potentials, in

order to better assess the applicability of the method and of its numerical stability and the

convergence pattern of the QLM iterations. It was shown that the ﬁrst few iterations already

provide very accurate and numerically stable answers for small and intermediate values of

the coupling constant and that the number of iterations necessary to reach a given precision

only moderately increases for larger values of the coupling. The method provided accurate

and stable answers for any coupling strengths, including for super singular potentials for

which each term of the perturbation theory diverges and the perturbation expansion does

not exist even for a very small coupling.

The quasilinearization approach is applicable to a general nonlinear ordinary or partial n -

th order diﬀerential equation in N-dimensional space. In this paper, we consider the case of

nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations in one variable which, unlike the nonlinear Calogero

equation [6] considered in references [1,2], contain not only quadratic nonlinear terms but

various other forms of nonlinearity and not only a ﬁrst, but also higher derivatives. Namely,

we apply it to a panopoly of well-known and diﬃcult nonlinear ordinary ﬁrst, second and

third order diﬀerential equations and show that again with just a small number of iterations

one can obtained fast convergent and uniformly excellent and stable numerical results.

The paper is arranged as follows: in the second chapter we present the main features of

the quasilinearization approach, while in the third chapter we consider, as a warm-up exer-

cise, a simple ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation with a nonlinear n-th power term and compare

its exact analytic solution with the perturbation theory and with the QLM iterations in

order to demonstrate the main features of the quasilinearization approach. In the next four

chapters, we apply our method to four nonlinear ordinary second and third order diﬀerential

equations, namely to the Lane-Emden, Thomas-Fermi, Duﬃng, and Blasius equations, re-

3

spectively. The results, convergence patterns, numerical stability, advantages of the method

and its possible future applications are discussed in the ﬁnal chapter.

II. THE QUASILINEARIZATION METHOD (QLM)

The aim of the QLM [1,3–5] is to solve a nonlinear n-th order ordinary or partial dif-

ferential equation in N dimensions as a limit of a sequence of linear diﬀerential equations.

This goal is easily understandable since there is no useful technique for obtaining the general

solution of a nonlinear equation in terms of a ﬁnite set of particular solutions, in contast

to a linear equation which can often be solved analytically or numerically in a convenient

fashion using superposition. In addition, the QL sequence should be constructed to assure

quadratic convergence and, if possible, monotonicity.

As we have mentioned in the Introduction, we will follow here the derivation outlined in

ref. [1], which is not based, unlike the derivations in refs. [3,4], on a smallness of the interval

and on the boundness of the nonlinear term and its functional derivatives, the conditions

which usually are not ﬁllﬁlled in physical applications.

For simplicity, we limit our discussion to nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equation in one

variable on the interval [0, b], which could be inﬁnite:

 L(n)u(x) = f (u(x), u(1)(x), ....u(n

1)(x), x),

with n boundary conditions

and

gk(u(0), u(1)(0), ...., u(n

Here L(n) is linear n-th order ordinary diﬀerential operator and f and g1, g2, ....., gn are

nonlinear functions of u(x) and its n

the same fashion by changing the deﬁnition of L(n) to be a linear n-th order diﬀerential

operator in partial derivatives and x to be an N-dimensional coordinate array.

The QLM prescription [1,3,4] determines the r + 1-th iterative approximation ur+1(x) to

the solution of Eq. (2.1) as a solution of the linear diﬀerential equation

The zeroth approximation u0(x) is chosen from mathematical or physical considerations.

To prove that the above procedure yields a quadratic and often monotonic convergence

to the solution of Eq. 2.1 with the boundary conditions 2.2 and 2.3, we follow reference [1]

and consider a diﬀerential equation for the diﬀerence δur+1(x)

two subsequent iterations:

1For example, in case of a simple nonlinear boundary condition u′(b)u(b) = c where c is a con-

stant, one has g(r)

g(u(r), u′(r), r) = u′(r)u(r) so that gu = u′(r) and gu′ = u(r). The lin-

earized boundary condition 2.6 has a form (ur+1(b)

or (ur+1(b)ur(b))′ = (ur(b)ur(b))′ so the nonlinear boundary condition for the initial guess

u0(b)u′0(b) = c will be propogated to the linear boundary condition for the next iterations.

The linearized boundary conditions 2.5 and 2.6 are obtained from exact boundary con-

ditions 2.2 and 2.3 by using the mean value theorem Eq. 2.10 and neglecting the quadratic

terms, so that the error in using linearized boundary conditions vis-a-vis the exact ones

is quadratic in the diﬀerence between the exact and linearized solutions. The maximum

diﬀerence between boundary conditions 2.5 and 2.6 corresponding to two subsequent quasi-

linear iterations is therefore quadratic in

δur

. In view of this result and of Eq. 2.19, the

diﬀerence between the subsequent iterative solutions of Eq.2.4 with boundary conditions 2.5

and 2.6 decreases quadratically with each iteration. In a similar way, one can show [1] that

the diﬀerence ∆ur+1(x) = u(x)

decreasing quadratically as well:

ur(x) between the exact solution and the r-th iteration is

The convergence depends therefore on the quantity q1 = k

, where, as we have

k

−

mentioned earlier, the zeroth iteration u0(x) is chosen from physical and mathematical

considerations. Usually it is advantageous (see discussion below) that u0(x) would satisfy

at least one of the boundary conditions. From Eq. (2.22) it follows, however, that for

convergence it is suﬃcient that just one of the quantities qm = k

δum

is small enough.

Consequently, one can always hope [4] that even if the ﬁrst convergent coeﬃcient q1 is

large, a well chosen initial approximation u0 results in the smallness of at least one of the

convergence coeﬃcients qm, m > 1, which then enables a rapid convergence of the iteration

series for r > m. It is important to stress that in view of the quadratic convergence of the

QLM method, the diﬀerence

between the exact solution and the QLM iteration

∆ur+1||

||

always converges to zero if the diﬀerence δur+1(x) between two subsequent QLM iterations

becomes inﬁnitesimally small.

Indeed, if δur(x) is close to zero, it means, since δur+1(x) = ∆ur(x)

∆ur+1(x) that

∆ur(x) = ∆ur+1(x) or Qr = Qr+1 where Qr = k

∆ur

||

||

bility that Qr and Qr+1 could be not small, one could conclude that the iteration process

−
. When one assumes the possi-

“stagnates”, which means convergence to the wrong answer or no convergence at all.

However, such a conclusion is wrong since Eq. 2.21, which can be written as Qr+1 ≤
r, for Qr
1 (this last inequality, starting from some r is a necessary condition of the

Q2

≤

convergence) could be not satisﬁed unless both

equal to zero. This proves

Qr+1||

||

and

Qr

||

||

that stagnation of the iteration process is impossible and convergence of

δur+1||

||

to zero

automatically leads to convergence of the QLM iteration sequence to the exact solution.

Hence the QLM assures not only convergence,i but also convergence to the correct solution.

Another corollary of this iteration process is that if the solution and its derivatives are

continuous functions of x, the convergence of the QLM in the whole region will follow.

Indeed, even if the zero iteration u0(x) is chosen not to satisfy the boundary conditions,

the next iteration u1(x), being a solution of a linear equation with linearized boundary

conditions 2.5 and 2.6, will automatically satisfy the exact boundary conditions 2.2 and 2.3,

at least up to the second order in diﬀerence δu1 at the boundaries. This means that the

diﬀerence between the exact and ﬁrst QLM iterations at some intervals near the boundaries

will be small, so that the QLM iterations in this interval would converge. Because the

subsequent values of k δum (x ), m > 2 became much smaller for this interval, in view of

assumed continuity of the solution and its derivatives these diﬀerences will also be small at

the neighboring intervals. The subsequent iterations will extend the convergence to the next

9

neighboring intervals and so on, until the convergence in the whole region will be reached.

The predicted trend is therefore that the QLM yields rapid convergence starting at the

regions where the boundary conditions are imposed and then spreading from there to all

other regions.

An additional important corollary is that, in view of Eq. 2.22, once the quasilinear

iteration sequence starts to converge, it will continue to do so, unlike the perturbation

expansion, which is often given by an asymptotic series and therefore converges only up to

a certain order and diverges thereafter.

the quasilinearization method:

Based on this summary of the QLM, one can deduce the following important features of

i) The method approximates the solution of nonlinear diﬀerential equations by treating

the nonlinear terms as a perturbation about the linear ones, and is not based, unlike

perturbation theories, on the existence of some kind of small parameter.

ii) The iterations converge uniformly and quadratically to the exact solution. In case of

matrix Mst in Eq. 2.15 being strictly positive (negative) for all x in the interval, the

convergence is also monotonic from below (above).

iii) For rapid convergence it suﬃces that an initial guess for the zeroth iteration is suﬃ-

ciently good to ensure the smallness of just one of the quantities qr = k

ur +1
k

−

ur

. If

k

the solution and its derivatives are continuous, convergence follows from the fact that

starting from the ﬁrst iteration, all QLM iterations automatically satisfy the quasilin-

earized boundary conditions 2.5 and 2.6. The convergence is extremely fast:

if, for

example, q1 is of the order of 1

3, only 4 iterations are necessary to reach the accuracy

of 8 digits, since ( 1

3 )2n is of the order of ( 1

10)2n−1.

iv) Convergence of

to zero automatically leads to convergence of the QLM itera-

δur+1||

||

tion sequence to the exact solution.

10

v) Once the quasilinear iteration sequence at some interval starts to converge, it will

always continue to do so. Unlike an asymptotic perturbation series, the quasilin-

earization method yeild the required precision once a successful initial guess generates

convergence after a few steps.

III. ANALYTICALLY SOLVABLE EXAMPLE: COMPARISON OF

QUASILINEARIZATION APPROACH WITH EXACT SOLUTION AND WITH

PERTURBATION THEORY.

In order to investigate the applicability of the quasilinearization method and its conver-

gence and numerical stability, let us start from a simple example of an analytically solvable

nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equation suggested in ref. [13]:

where the boundary condition at r = 0 is also given and ′ means diﬀerentiation in variable

r. The exact solution to this problem is

Since

the expansion of the solution 3.2 in powers of g is given by

The convergence radius of the series 3.4 is R = 1/(g (n

to the extent n

Now consider the quasilinearization approach to this equation, taking, for example, g = 1

and n = 6. Here we consider Eq. 3.1 with a rather strong degree of nonlinearity. In this

case, one can expect the convergence of the perturbation expansion only up to r

R = 1

The QLM procedure in the case where nonlinear term depends only on the solution itself

and not on its derivatives reduces to setting u′k+1(r) = f (uk)+(uk+1(r)

uk(r)) fu(uk). Here

f =

g un(r) while its functional derivative fu equels to

The results of our QLM calculations with Eq. 3.5 are presented in Fig. 1 which displays

the exact solution for the case of n = 6 and g = 1, together with the ﬁrst four QLM

iterations. Convergence to the exact solution in Fig. 1 is monotonic from above as it should

be as discussed in Section II and in Refs. [1,3,4] due to fact that the second functional

derivative

n(n

2(x) of the left-hand side of Eq.3.1 for even n is strictly negative.

The convergence starts at the boundary, exactly as expected from the discussion in section

II, and expands with each iteration to larger values of the variable r. The diﬀerence between

the exact solution and the sixth QLM iteration for all r in the range between zero and ﬁve

where our calculations were performed is less than 10−

6. Note that the QLM yields a solution

beyond the convergence radius limit on the series solution of 1/5.

A. Lane-Emden equation

The Lane-Emden equation

y′′(r) +

y′(r) + yn(r) = 0,

y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 0

(3.6)

r

is a nonlinear second order diﬀerential equation which arises in the study of stellar structure.

It describes the equilibrium density distribution in a self-gravitating sphere of polytropic

isothermal gas. The parameter n corresponds to a particular choice for an equation of

state with its physically interesting range being 0

5. The equation also appears in

n

12

other contexts, e.g., in case of radiatively cooling, self gravitating gas clouds, in the mean-

ﬁeld treatment of a phase transition in critical absorption or in the modeling of clusters of

galaxies. The equation can be solved analytically for the special cases n = 0, 1 and 5. For

other values of n, power series approximations as well as nonperturbative approaches have

been developed (see, for example, [13,14] and references therein). Setting y = u

r transforms

the equation to a more convenient form without a ﬁrst derivative:

u′′(r) +

1 = 0, u(0) = 0, u′(0) = 1.

Let us consider this nonlinear equation for the physically interesting and analytically non-

The simplest initial guess, satisfying the boundary conditions will be u0(r) = r. Comparison

of the quasilinear solutions corresponding to the ﬁrst ﬁve iterations with the numerically

computed exact solution are given in Fig. 2. The ﬁgure shows that the convergence to

the exact solution is very fast. It starts, as in the example of the previous section, at the

left boundary and spreads with each iteration to larger values of r as expected from the

discussion in section II. The diﬀerence between the exact solution and the eighth QLM

iteration for all r in the range between zero and ten, where our calculations were performed,

is less than 10−

11 .

IV. THOMAS-FERMI EQUATION

The Thomas-Fermi equation [15,16]

√x u′′(x) = u

2 (x),

3

u(0) = 1, u(

) = 0,

∞

(4.1)

is an equation for the electron density around the nucleus of the atom. The left hand

side of the above equation equals zero for u < 0. The Thomas-Fermi equation is also very

useful for calculating form-factors and for obtaining eﬀective potentials which can be used

13

as initial trial potentials in self-consistent ﬁeld calculations..

It is also applicable to the

study of nucleons in nuclei and electrons in metal. It is long known (see [17] and references

therein) that solution of this equation is very sensitive to a value of the ﬁrst derivative at

zero which insures smooth and monotonic decay from u(0) = 1 to u(

) = 0 as demanded

∞

by boundary conditions. Finding the value of u′(0) accurately is a tedious procedure requir-

ing a considerable computer time. By contrast, the computation is much simpler for the

quasilinearized version of this equation. The QLM procedure in this case reduces to setting
uk(r))fu(uk), where f = u3/2(r)
√x

and the functional derivative

u′′k+1(r) = f (uk) + (uk+1(r)
is fu = (3/2) u1/2

√x , so that the QLM equation has a form:

√x u′′k+1(x)

k (x) uk+1(x) =

which is easily solved by specifying directly the boundary condition at inﬁnity without

searching ﬁrst for the proper value of the ﬁrst derivative. The initial guess, satisfying the

boundary condition at zero was chosen to be u0(x)

1. The results of QLM calculations

≡

with Eq. 4.2 are presented in Fig. 3 which displays the exact solution together with the

ﬁrst four QLM iterations. The convergence starts at the boundaries, exactly as expected

from the discussion in section II, and expands with each iteration to a wider range of values

of the variable x. The diﬀerence between the exact solution and the eighth QLM iteration

for all x in the range between zero and forty where our calculations were performed is less

than 10−

V. CLASSICAL ANHARMONIC OSCILLATOR

The classical anharmonic oscillator satisﬁes the nonlinear second-order equation

¨u(t) + u(t) + g u3(t) = 0

(5.1)

commonly referred to as the Duﬃng equation.

In our example, we impose the following

boundary conditions at zero t

14

u(0) = 1,

˙u(0) = 0.

(5.2)

The solution oscillates strongly and thus is more diﬃcult to approximate. It is, for example,

well known [13] that the usual perturbative solution is valid only for times t small compared

with 1

g , so that for larger g the perturbative solution is adequate only on a small time

interval. In contrast, the quasilinearization approach gives solution in the whole region also

for large g-values.

The quasilinearized equation is

¨uk+1(t) + (1 + 3 g u2

k(t))uk+1(t)

2 g u3

k(t) = 0,

uk+1(0) = 1,

˙uk+1(0) = 0.

(5.3)

−

The results of QLM calculations with Eq. 5.3 for g = 3 are presented in Figs. 4 and 5.

Fig. 4 displays the exact solution together with the QLM solutions for the ﬁrst, second and

fourth iterations while Fig. 5 shows comparison of exact solution with sixth, seventh and

eighth QLM iterations. Again, the convergence starts at the left boundary as expected from

the discussion in section II, and expands with each iteration to larger values of the variable

t. The diﬀerence between the exact solution and the eleventh QLM iteration for all t in the

range between zero and seven where our calculations were performed is less than 10−

10 .

VI. BLASIUS EQUATION

The Blasius equation [18]

u′′′(x) + u′′(x)u(x) = 0,

u(0) = u′(0) = 0 , u′(

) = 1

(6.1)

∞

is a third order nonlinear diﬀerential equation which describes the velocity proﬁle of the ﬂuid

in the boundary layer which forms when ﬂuid ﬂows along a ﬂat plate. The Blasius equation

is similar to the Thomas-Fermi equation in that it has a two-point boundary condition.

However, it diﬀers from the Thomas-Fermi case in that it is of higher order and also contains

a second derivative term times u(x). Therefore, Eq. 6.1 is even more diﬃcult to solve. The

QLM procedure in this case is given by u′′′k+1(x) = f (uk, u′′k) + (uk+1 −

uk)fu(uk, u′′k) +

15

u′′k)fu′′(uk, u′′k), where f (u, u′) =

(u′′k+1 −

quasilinearized version of the Blasius equation thus has a form

u′′u, fu(u, u′) =

u′′ and fu′′(u, u′) =

u′′′k+1(x) + uk(x)u′′k+1(x) + uk+1(x)u′′k(x)

uk(x)u′′k(x) = 0,

−

uk+1(0) = u′k+1(0) = 0 , u′k+1(

) = 1.

∞

(6.2)

The initial guess, satisfying the boundary condition for the derivative at zero was chosen

to be u0(x)

1. The results of QLM calculations with Eq. 6.2 are presented in Fig. 6 which

≡

displays the exact solution together with the ﬁrst QLM iteration. The convergence starts

at the left boundary as follows from the discussion in section II, and expands with each

iteration to larger values of the variable x. The diﬀerence between the exact solution and

the ﬁfth QLM iteration for all x in the range between zero and ten where our calculations

were performed is less than 10−

11 .

VII. CONCLUSION

Summing up, we formulated here the conditions under which the quadratic, uniform and

often monotonic convergence of the quasilinearization method are valid.

We have followed here the derivation outlined in ref. [1], which is not based, unlike the

derivations in refs. [3,4], on a smallness of the interval and on the boundness of the nonlinear

term and its functional derivatives, the conditions which usually are not fulﬁlled in physical

applications.

In order to analyze and highlight the power and features of the quasilinearization method

(QLM), in this work we have also made numerical computations on diﬀerent ordinary second

and third order nonlinear diﬀerential equations, applied in physics, such as the Blasius,

Duﬃng, Lane-Emden and Thomas-Fermi equations and have compared the results obtained

by the quasilinearization method with the exact solutions. Although all our examples deal

only with linear boundary conditions, the nonlinear boundary conditions can be handled

readily after their quasilinearization as explained in Section II.

16

Our conclusions are as follows:

The QLM treats nonlinear terms as a perturbation about the linear ones [1,3,4] and is

not based on the existence of some kind of small parameter. As a result, as we see in all our

examples, the QLM is able to handle large values of the coupling constant and any degree

of the nonlinearity, unlike perturbation theory. Thus the QLM provides extremely accurate

and numerically stable answers for a wide range of nonlinear physics problems.

In view of all this, since most equations of physics, from classical mechanics to quantum

ﬁeld theory, are either not linear or could be transformed into a nonlinear form, the quasi-

linearization method appears to be extremely useful and in many cases more advantageous

than the perturbation theory or its diﬀerent modiﬁcations, like expansion in inverse powers

of the coupling constant, the 1/N expansion, etc.

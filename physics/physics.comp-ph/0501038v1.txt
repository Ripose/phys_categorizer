Density matrix perturbation theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 193001 (2004)] provides an eﬃcient
framework for the linear scaling computation of response properties [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 193002
(2004)].
In this article, we generalize density matrix perturbation theory to include properties
computed with a perturbation dependent non-orthogonal basis. Such properties include analytic
derivatives of the energy with respect to nuclear displacement, as well as magnetic response com-
puted with a ﬁeld dependent basis. The non-orthogonal density matrix perturbation theory is
developed in the context of recursive puriﬁcation methods, which are brieﬂy reviewed.

INTRODUCTION

During the last decade a new computational paradigm
has evolved in electronic structure theory, where no crit-
ical part of a calculation is allowed to increase in com-
plexity more than linearly with system size [1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].
Linear scaling electronic structure theory extends tight-
binding, Hartree-Fock, and Kohn-Sham schemes to the
study of large complex systems beyond the reach of con-
ventional methods.
In general, conventional methods
have three computational bottlenecks: (1) construction
of the Hartree-Fock, tight-binding, or Kohn-Sham Hamil-
tonian, (2) solution of the self-consistent-ﬁeld equations
to obtain the ground state, and quite often, (3) the eval-
uation of response properties. Here we will focus on the
last problem, including calculations of both linear and
higher order non-linear response. The main purpose is
to present a non-orthogonal generalization of the den-
sity matrix perturbation theory, recently introduced by
the authors [28], which was used for linear scaling com-
putation of static electric polarizabilities by perturbed
projection [29].

A non-orthogonal generalization of the density matrix
perturbation theory is important because it includes ba-
sis set dependent perturbations in the overlap matrix,
i.e. the basis function inner products, when using non-
orthogonal local orbitals.
In this case, the perturbed
Hartree-Fock or Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem may be
expressed in the generalized form

(H + H′) φi = εi (S + S′) φi,

(1)

with both the eﬀective Hamiltonian H and the overlap
matrix S modiﬁed by the perturbations H′ and S′, respec-
tively. Such perturbations are encountered when using a
basis of atom centered Atomic Orbitals and computing
geometric energy derivatives [35, 36], and also when cal-
culating magnetic response properties with ﬁeld depen-
dent Gauge Including Atomic Orbitals.

Previously, non-orthogonal generalizations of linear
scaling methods for calculation of the density matrix

have been developed by including the overlap matrix
as a metric tensor in operator products [20, 37, 38].
Non-orthogonal density matrix schemes for solving the
coupled-perturbed self-consistent-ﬁeld equations [39, 40,
41] have also been put forward, which pose density ma-
trix derivatives implicitly through a set of commuting
Sylvester-like equations [42]. In this article, we present a
non-orthogonal generalization of density matrix pertur-
bation theory, based on an explicit recursive expansion
of the non-orthogonal density matrix and its derivatives.
This theory provides a framework for extending linear
scaling response calculations to properties with a non-
orthogonal basis set dependence on the perturbation.

The article is outlined as follows: First we give a brief
review of the orthogonal formulation of density matrix
puriﬁcation and density matrix perturbation theory. Op-
erators represented in an orthogonal basis set are de-
scribed by italics (P ). Thereafter we generalize the de-
scription to non-orthogonal representations, where the
matrices are described by normal letters (P). The central
result is the non-orthogonal density matrix perturbation
theory in section III B. A simple example is given in de-
tail for the expansion of the interatomic pair interaction
of the diatomic H+

2 molecule up to fourth order.

II. ORTHOGONAL DENSITY MATRIX
PURIFICATION AND DENSITY MATRIX
PERTURBATION THEORY

A. Orthogonal puriﬁcation

Linear scaling electronic structure theory is based on
the quantum locality (or nearsightedness) of non-metallic
systems [14, 43, 44, 45, 46]. In a local basis, this local-
ity is manifested in an approximate exponential decay
of density matrix elements with inter-atomic separation.
Under these conditions, and using a sparse linear algebra
with the dropping of numerically small elements below a
threshold τ , the number of non-zero entries in the density
matrix scales asymptotically linearly, O(N ), with system
size N . This sparsity is used to achieve an O(N ) com-

2

plexity in an iterative construction of the density ma-
trix by operating only with sparse intermediate matri-
ces. Several of these techniques are based on the Fermi
operator relation between the density matrix P and the
Hamiltonian H taken at T = 0,

given by the step function θ (spectral projector), with

One approach to constructing P is through expansion

With the two-term recurrence

(4)

the computational cost for evaluation of Eq. (3) scales
as O(p) with polynomial order p of the Chebychev ex-
pansion. However, this cost can be reduced to O(√p)
by using a hierarchical summation of polynomial terms,
rather than the two-term recurrence relation [48, 50].
While this reduces the computational cost, it demands
more intermediate memory to store temporary matrices.
In either case, the order of the polynomial approxima-
tion in Eq. (3), p, must be kept fairly low, leading to
problems with incompleteness. An incomplete Cheby-
chev series results in Gibbs oscillations, which are high
frequency ripples that form about the step. These oscilla-
tions can be reduced by applying Gibbs damping factors
to the Chebychev polynomials as in the Kernel Polyno-
mial Method [8, 47, 49]. However, this reduces the slope
of the step function and a higher order expansion is nec-
essary to resolve the step at the chemical potential [49].
Alternatively, density matrix puriﬁcation is a recursive
approach to spectral projection [20, 26, 28, 51, 52, 53,
54, 55, 56] that approximates the matrix step function
projection as

P = θ(µI

H) = lim
n→∞

−

Fn(Fn−1(...F0(H)...)).

(5)

Initiating a puriﬁcation sequence is the linear transform
F0(H), which normalizes the spectra of H to [0, 1] in re-
verse order. The functions Fn (n > 0) are typically low
order, monotonically increasing polynomials, with ﬁxed
points at 0 and 1. Each puriﬁcation polynomial Fn grad-
ually shifts the eigenvalues of the approximate interme-
diate density matrix Xn to 0 for unoccupied states and
to 1 for occupied states as

Xn+1 = Fn(Xn) = . . . = Fn(...F0(H)...) ,

(6)

creating a successively more “puriﬁed” intermediate
Xn+1.

∼

Puriﬁcation has several advantages. First, a pth order
truncated puriﬁcation sequence can be developed with
a complexity of O(log p). For example, with quadratic
109 order expansion can be reached
polynomials, a p
in only 30 iterations. Also, because the polynomials Fn
are monotonically increasing, so to are the corresponding
puriﬁcation sequences, regardless of the degree of incom-
pleteness. The Gibbs oscillations resulting from trun-
cation of the Chebychev series are therefore avoided and
the application of damping factors is no longer necessary.
Figure 1 illustrates the typical behavior using second or-
der trace correcting puriﬁcation as described below.

∼

10−4

To achieve a linear scaling with puriﬁcation, threshold-
ing is applied after each recursive expansion step to the
intermediates Xn, removing elements below a tolerance
10−6). This often leads to a substantial in-
τ (
crease in computational eﬃciency, but also to an accumu-
lation of numerical error with each recursive puriﬁcation
step. This error involves corruption of the eigenbasis,
which at ﬁrst increases exponentially [51]. However, this
error accumulation disappears as the eigenvalues of Xn
approach 0 or 1. Since the number of puriﬁcation steps
necessary to reach convergence scales with the logarithm
of the inverse band gap, the method is stable and the to-
tal accumulated error is well controlled. At convergence
the density matrix error scales linearly with the thresh-
old τ and the error in total energy decreases quadratically
with decreasing τ [51].

Density matrix puriﬁcation methods diﬀer in the way
the puriﬁcation polynomials Fn(Xn) are chosen. In grand
canonical schemes [20, 26, 54] the initial linear normaliza-
tion X1 = F0(H) shifts the eigenvalues such that all oc-
cupied eigenvalues are in [c, 1] and all unoccupied eigen-
values in [0, c], where c is some predeﬁned number (typi-
cally c = 0.5). Thereafter a ﬁxed puriﬁcation polynomial
with inﬂection point at c is used, which shifts eigenval-
ues above (below) c to 1 (0). At convergence the correct

occupation is therefore reached, with

Tr(P ) = lim
n→∞

Tr(Xn) = Ne.

(7)

the occupation,

The problem with this approach is that it requires prior
knowledge of the chemical potential µ, which has to be
shifted to the inﬂection point c in the initial normal-
ization X1 = F0(H). To avoid the problem with an
unknown chemical potential Palser and Manolopoulos
(PM) devised a canonical puriﬁcation scheme [20] with
the puriﬁcation polynomials chosen such that the trace,
is preserved in each puriﬁcation
i.e.
step. By choosing the initial normalization such that
Tr(X1) = Tr[F0(H)] = Ne the PM scheme automatically
converges to the correct density matrix, without prior
knowledge of the chemical potential. The problem with
this method is that it has a very slow convergence at high
or low occupation [20, 26]. A solution to this problem was
given by the introduction of trace correcting puriﬁcation
[26] described below.

1. Second order trace correcting puriﬁcation

Trace correcting puriﬁcation [26, 51, 55] is an eﬃcient
approach to density matrix puriﬁcation at both high and
low occupation and does not require knowledge of the
chemical potential. In trace correcting puriﬁcation the
polynomials Fn(Xn) correct the trace Tr(Xn) and ex-
pand the step function simultaneously. At convergence,
the correct occupation of the density matrix is reached,
such that Tr(P ) = limn→∞ Tr(Xn) = Ne. The simplest
and most memory eﬃcient form is the second order trace
correcting algorithm [26], given by

X1 = F0(H) =

correcting recursion in Eq. (9) is equivalent to previously
published versions [26, 28, 29], but is presented here in a
form more closely related to an eﬃcient implementation.
In the case of aggressive thresholding and high or
low occupation, the eigenvalues of Xn can sometimes
be pushed out of the domain of guaranteed convergence,
[0, 1]. To enhance stability under loose thresholding, we
alternate the sign of the trace correction in every step,
with σn =
σn−1 as convergence is approached, typically
when Tr[(I

Xn)Xn] < 0.1.

B. Orthogonal Perturbation Theory

The main obstacle in formulating a density matrix per-
turbation theory based directly on the relation between
the Hamiltonian and the spectral projector, given by
Eq. (2), is the discontinuous, non-analytic nature of the
step function. Diﬃculties with this discontinuity are fur-
ther ampliﬁed when considering direct expansion of the
projector. At ﬁnite temperatures close to zero, we could
use the analytic Fermi-Dirac function, but this involves
the computation of matrix exponentials and requires the
chemical potential a priori to high precision. However,
puriﬁcation methods furnish a recursive, analytic, mono-
tonically increasing and highly accurate representation
of the step function that does not require prior knowl-
edge of the chemical potential. The fundamental idea
behind our approach is that this representation can be
used in a direct variation of the density matrix with re-
spect to a perturbed Hamiltonian, where perturbations
in H can be carried through at each level of puriﬁca-
tion, either exactly or to ﬁnite order [28]. At ﬁnite order,
this theory provides a framework for the computation of
density matrix derivatives in the N -scaling computation
of adiabatic response properties by perturbed projection
[29, 57]. At inﬁnite order, i.e. with an exact expansion,
the method can be used for eﬃcient quantum embedding
of local perturbations [28].

The constants εmax and εmin are upper and lower esti-

thus transforms all eigenvalues of H to the interval [0, 1]
in reverse order. The function sign(x) denotes the sign

n ). Since
the diﬀerences ∆n change quadratically in each iteration,
the expansion order is in practice inﬁnite at convergence
and therefore exact. For insulators the computational
cost scales linearly with the size of the perturbed region
O(Npert.) since the recursion only involves terms with
the response factors ∆n. For a local perturbation the
computational cost is therefore independent of system
size, i.e. it scales as O(1) [28].

The perturbation theory is grand canonical since the
expansion of the perturbation is performed at a ﬁxed
chemical potential determined by the unperturbed (or
the perturbed) system. For suﬃciently large perturba-
tions, states may cross the chemical potentials µ. In this
case limn→∞ Tr(∆n)

These equations provide an explicit and rapidly conver-
gent algorithm for the computation of the density matrix
response to high order in the expansion parameter [28].
In addition, the formalism presented here is remarkably
simple and can be easily extended to multiple indepen-
dent perturbations [29, 57].

III. NON-ORTHOGONAL DENSITY MATRIX
PURIFICATION AND DENSITY MATRIX
PERTURBATION THEORY

In a non-orthogonal representation, the Hartree-Fock
or Kohn-Sham equations may be posed as the generalized
matrix eigenvalue problem,

Hφi = εiSφi,

ε1 ≤

ε2 ≤

. . . ,

(25)

where the overlap matrix S is a matrix of basis function
inner products.

In the following, a non-orthogonal density matrix pu-
riﬁcation algorithm is developed. Then, a non-orthogonal
density matrix perturbation theory is introduced that ad-
mits simultaneous perturbations in both the Hamiltonian
and the overlap matrix. Normal letters (H) are used
to distinguish the non-orthogonal representation from
the corresponding orthogonal representation denoted by
symbols in italics (H).

This preserves the covariant (or contravariant) form after

The most challenging aspect of non-orthogonal puriﬁ-
cation is obtaining an initial normalization X1, which
must obey the commutation relation

als, which have the form

where the ak are polynomial expansion coeﬃcients.

There are a number of options for initiating the non-

orthogonal puriﬁcation, three of which are

X1 = F0(H) = α(βS−1

S−1HS−1),
X1 = F0(H) = α(H−1 + βS−1),
βS)−1,

X1 = F0(H) = α(H

−

−

(32)
(33)
(34)

where α and β are chosen to map the eigenvalues into
[0,1] in reverse order. Ideally, an eﬃcient choice of nor-
malization concentrates all unoccupied states near 0, and
all occupied states near 1.

The ﬁrst choice, Eq. (32), is analogous to the initial
guess suggested by Palser and Manolopoulos [20] for their
non-orthogonal grand canonical puriﬁcation scheme, and
amounts to a shift and linear rescaling of eigenvalues.
This linear rescaling can lead to a small renormalized gap
in [0, 1] for the case of low occupation in the large basis
set limit. The second case, Eq. (33), is of minor interest
since it involves calculations of both H−1 and S−1. The
third normalization, Eq. (34), is the most interesting and
1,
useful of the initializations. With α = 1 and β = εmin−
where εmin is a lower bound of the eigenvalues εi in Eq.
(25), this is a Green’s function,

which provides the correct normalization.
In this nor-
malization, the unoccupied states are mapped to 0 as
1/εi. For large basis sets, with a low fractional occupa-
tion, this amounts to a rescaled band gap on the interval
[0, 1] that is larger relative to the band gap given by the
linear rescaling. Since the number of iterations needed to
reach convergence scales with the logarithm of the inverse
band gap [26] the Green’s function initialization can be
expected to be more eﬃcient in the large basis set limit.

1. Computation and reﬁnement of X1 = G(β)

The Green’s function resolvent G(β) can be calcu-
lated with linear scaling complexity for suﬃciently large

and sparse systems using several techniques, such as
the Schulz iteration [58], the sparse approximate inverse
[59, 60], and other methods [61]. In a self-consistent cal-
culation, where the Hamiltonian is changed in each iter-
ation, or in a quantum molecular dynamics simulation,
where both the overlap and the Hamiltonian is modiﬁed,
we can eﬃciently update the new initialization

X1(new) = (Hnew −

βSnew)−1

(36)

from the previous iteration. If X1(old) and X1(new) are
suﬃciently close the following scheme, based on Schulz’s
method [58], rapidly converges to the new normalization:

Y0
Yn+1 = 2Yn

X1(new) = Gnew(β) = limn→∞ Yn.

Yn(Hnew −

(37)

In this way, the cost can be reduced by using Schulz’s
method as an eﬃcient iterative reﬁnement technique.

2. Non-Orthogonal Trace Correcting Puriﬁcation

cation scheme is given by

(42)

Note that any of the initializations in Eqs. (32)-(34) can
be used to calculate X1, realizing diﬀerent levels of per-
formance.

B. Non-Orthogonal Perturbation Theory

With an eﬃcient normalization scheme in hand, given
by Eq. (34), generalization of the density matrix pertur-
bation theory to a non-orthogonal formulation follows,
constituting the central result of this paper. At ﬁnite
order, it provides the framework for computation of ba-
sis set dependent response properties, including magnetic

6

(51)

(52)

(53)

response and geometric energy derivatives. The non-
orthogonal extension is also useful for density matrix ex-
trapolation in geometry optimization [62].

The non-orthogonal perturbation theory below is de-
veloped in the context of second order trace correcting
puriﬁcation. However, the formalism can be based also
on other puriﬁcation methods, such as grand canoni-
cal puriﬁcation [20, 26, 54], canonical puriﬁcation [20],
higher order trace correcting schemes and their hybrids
[26, 51, 55], implicit puriﬁcation at ﬁnite temperatures
[56], or matrix sign function expansions [63, 64].

1. Exact expansion (inﬁnite order)

quence that can be expanded to all orders in λ,

The initial expansion of X1 can be calculated using any
of the normalizations given by Eqs. (32)-(34). However,

the expansion of X1 particularly simple. The terms are

G(0)T(1)G(0),
G(0)T(2)G(0) + G(0)T(1)G(0)T(1)G(0),

The occupation Nocc = Tr(S(0)Xn). Sine the perturba-

diﬀerence between the puriﬁcation of the perturbed and

also for the ﬁnite perturbation expansion described be-

This method for the calculation of density matrix re-
sponse, including perturbations in the overlap matrix for
a non-orthogonal representation, composes the central re-
sult of this paper.

IV. EXAMPLE

To illustrate the non-orthogonal perturbation theory
we have chosen a diatomic hydrogen ion H+
2 described in
a basis set of two hydrogenic 1s-orbitals [65]. The overlap
matrix S(R) as a function of inter-atomic distance R (in
units of Bohr radius a0) is given by

S1,1 = S2,2 = 1
S1,2 = S2,1 = (1 + R + (1/3)R2)e−R.

(58)

The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian H(R) are

H1,1 = H2,2 = E0 −
H1,2 = H2,1 = (E0 + κR−1)S1,2 −

(1 + R)e−2R) + κR−1

where κ = e2/(4πε0) (set to 1 in the calculation). By ex-
panding H and S in r = (R
R0) around the equilibrium
distance R0 (or any other point) we have

−

H = H(0) + rH(1) + r2H(2) + . . . ,
S = S(0) + rS(1) + r2S(2) + . . . ,

where

H(m) = (m!)−1∂mH/∂Rm at R = R0,
S(m) = (m!)−1∂mS/∂Rm at R = R0.

(61)

The initial perturbations ∆(m)
are given by Eq. (51)
and the recursive expansion is calculated as described in
Eq. (55). At convergence the normalized density matrix
derivatives P(m) are given by Eq. (56). The expansion of
the energy is given by collecting the energy

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have shown how density matrix per-
turbation theory based on recursive puriﬁcation can be
generalized to include basis-set dependent perturbations.
This makes it possible, for example, to calculate struc-
tural response properties using local atomic-centered or-
bitals within a reduced complexity formalism. Some key
features of importance are: (1) an orbital-free density
matrix formulation, which avoids the calculation of eigen-
functions and eigenvalues, (2) very high order, mono-
tonically increasing analytic approximation of the step
function, (3) initial normalization of the Hamiltonian to
fulﬁll the non-orthogonal commutation relation, which is
preserved after each puriﬁcation, and (4) the ability to

collect perturbations recursively, exactly (inﬁnite order)
or to any ﬁnite order, at each level of puriﬁcation.

A practical generalization of the Green’s function ini-

tialization in Eq. (35) is given by

X1 = G(z) = z−1

which is stable for all z > 0. The value of z can be tuned
to improve convergence and computational eﬃciency by
optimizing the size of the band gap of the normalized
spectra of X1. The puriﬁcation expansion is stable with
respect to a complex generalization and the constant z
can be extended to regions of the complex plane, in anal-
ogy to Green’s functions for complex energies.

(cid:3)

If an ill-conditioned non-orthogonal basis set is used we
may run into numerical problems if we chose to trans-
form the generalized eigenvalue problem to an orthog-
onal representation. With the present formulation for
non-orthogonal puriﬁcation and perturbation theory, this
congruence transform is avoided. Instead it is replaced by
the calculation of G(z). However, if the condition num-
ber of G(z) is smaller compared to the condition number
of S, the numerical accuracy is improved. In addition, the
back-transform from the orthogonal density matrix rep-
resentation to the atomic orbital representation, which
is necessary to calculate the electronic density expressed
in the atomic orbital basis, is avoided within a purely
non-orthogonal formalism.
The example for the H+

2 molecule illustrates the ex-
tension of the orbital-free density matrix perturbation
theory to non-orthogonal representations. We have also
applied the non-orthogonal method to recalculate the po-
larizability of molecular clusters with results identical to
previous calculations [29, 57]. Since only matrix-matrix
operations are used, the computational cost scales lin-
early with system size for suﬃciently large non-metallic
systems, as was shown previously for the perturbed pro-
jection scheme in an orthogonalized representation [29].

The non-orthogonal density matrix perturbation theory
can therefore eﬃciently be applied in calculations of re-
sponse properties with a perturbation dependent basis
set for large complex systems.

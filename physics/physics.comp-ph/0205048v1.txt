The Heterogeneous Multi-Scale Method

Weinan E∗

February 20, 2014

Abstract

The heterogeneous multi-scale method (HMM) is a general strategy for dealing
with problems involving multi-scales, with multi-physics, using multi-grids.
It not
only uniﬁes several existing multi-scale methods, but also provide a methodology for
designing new algorithms for new applications. In this paper, we review the history
of multi-scale modeling and simulation that led to the development of HMM, the
methodology itself together with some applications, and the mathematical theory of
stability and accuracy.

1 Introduction

In the past several years, there has been an explosive growth of interest on numerical com-
putations for problems involving multi-scales, often with multiple levels of physical models
and use multi-grids. Applications of these ideas are found in many diﬀerent areas, including
coupling quantum mechanics with molecular dynamics [12, 73, 75], coupling atomistics with
continuum theory [66, 1, 55, 53, 11, 24, 45, 37], coupling kinetic theory with continuum
theory [8, 30, 42, 72], coupling kinetic Monte Carlo methods with continuum theory [58],
homogenization theory [5, 28, 40, 60, 41], and coarse-grained bifurcation analysis [67, 57].
From the point of view of numerical analysis, it is natural to ask whether these seemingly
diﬀerent applications can be put into a common framework, and whether a general theory
of stability and accuracy can be provided. Such a theory should help us to improve existing
methods, design new ones, and extend their applicability to other problems.

Finite element method provided an example of a success story of this kind. The practice
of ﬁnite element methods was started by structural engineers on very speciﬁc applications.

However, the work of mathematicians at the end of the 60’s and early 70’s put ﬁnite element
method on a much more solid and general framework. This framework provided a thorough
understanding of existing methods, suggested improvements and as well as extension to other
areas such as ﬂuid mechanics, electromagnetism, etc.

In this article, we will review the work in [21] that aimed at providing a general framework
as well as a stability and accuracy theory for numerical methods involving multiscales, multi-
grids and multi-physics. For convenience and to emphasize the multi-physics nature of these
methods, we will call them Heterogeneous multiscale methods. In contrast, typical multi-
grid methods are homogeneous in the sense that they use the same model at diﬀerent levels
of grids and are aimed at eﬃciently resolving the details at the ﬁnest grids.

To begin with, let us make some remarks about problems with multiple scales. Such
problems are found everywhere around us. A classical example that has been extensively
studied in the mathematics literature is the problem of homogenization.

with Dirichlet boundary condition uε|∂Ω = 0, for example [6]. Here the multiscale nature
is reﬂected in the coeﬃcients a
, ε ≪ 1. In the simplest models a(x, y) is assumed to
be periodic in y, say with period I = [0, 1]d, d is the dimension of the physical space. (1)
can be used for modelling transport properties in a medium with microstructure, and the
oscillatory nature of a is used to model the microstructures in the medium.

Traditionally problems of this type are dealt with either analytically or empirically by
ﬁnding eﬀective models that eliminate the small scales. For the homogenization problem
(1), this means replacing (1) by a homogenized equation [6, 69] or eﬀective equation

−∇ · (A(x)∇U(x)) = f (x)

x ∈ Ω.

The solution U of this equation approximates the behavior of uε averaged over length scales
that are much larger than ε but smaller than the slow variations of a and f . In the special
case when d = 1, A(x) is given simply by

A(x) =

An althernative to such analytical methods is the empirical modelling. As an example,
let us consider simple incompressible ﬂuids. Let u be the velocity ﬁeld. Mass and momentum
conservation gives,

where ρ is the (constant) density, τd is the viscous stress, which is a macroscopic idealization
of the internal friction forces due to the short-ranged molecular interactions. τd must be
modeled in order to close the equation (4). The simplest empirical model is to assume that
τd is linearly related to D = ∇u+(∇u)T
, the rate of strain tensor. Using homogeneity, isotropy
and incompressibility gives the constitutive relation

τd = νD

(5)

where ν is the viscosity of the ﬂuid. In this model, all molecular details are lumped into
a single number ν. It is quite amazing that such a simple ansatz describes very well the
behavior of simple liquids in almost all regimes.

Despite all these successes, such traditional approaches also have their limitations. Al-
though a nice set of equations can be derived rigorously for the eﬀective coeﬃcients A(x)
in (2), they are not explicit and evaluating them involves a considerable amount of work.
Finding empirical constitutive relations for complex ﬂuids such as polymeric ﬂuids or liquid
crystals has also proven to be a diﬃcult task. In general the constitutive relations tend to
contain many empirical parameters and their accuracy is also often in serious doubt.

Such problems are not limited to hydrodynamics where constitutive relations are needed,
but is common to most modeling process. In molecular dynamics, one needs to model, often
In kinetic Monte Carlo methods, one needs to model
empirically, the atomic potentials.
In kinetic equations, one needs to model the collision cross-section.
the transition rates.
In nonlinear elasticity, one needs to model the stored-energy functional.
In typical mean
ﬁeld theories, one needs to model the eﬀective local ﬁelds and the free energy functional. In
general, the empircal models work well for relatively simple systems, but lose their accuracy
for complex systems.

In the last decade, a new approach, the “ﬁrst principle-based” approach, has been ve-
hemently pursued in various areas of applications. The basic idea is to replace empirical
models by coupling with direct numerical simulations at a more microscopic level. Some of
the best known examples of this approach include:

1. Ab initio molecular dynamics [12]. Here one replaces the empirical atomic potential in
molecular dynamics by explicit calculations of the electronic structures. The Car-Parrinello
method is a practical way of implementing this idea [12].

2. Quasi-continuum method [66, 62]. This is a method for doing nonlinear elasticity
calculations without the need of a stored-energy functional. Instead, the stored energy is
computed directly from atomic potentials using the Cauchy-Born rule. We will return to
this later.

3. The Gas-kinetic scheme [71]. This is a method for doing gas dynamics calculations
using directly the kinetic equations instead of the hydrodynamic equations. Since it played
an important role in the framework developed in [21], we brieﬂy review the important steps
here.

3

Given {ρn, un, T n}, the density, velocity and temperature at time step n at each cell, the

corresponding values at the next time step, {ρn+1, un+1, T n+1} are computed by:

Step 1. Reconstruction. From {ρn, un, T n}, reconstruct f n, the one particle phase space

distribution function near the cell boundaries.

Step 2. Solve the kinetic equation with initial data f n near the cell boundaries. In [71],

the kinetic equaiton is chosen as the BGK equation

ft + (u · ∇)f =

(X(ρ,u,T ) − f )

1
ε

where X(ρ,u,T ) is the local Maxwellian associated with (ρ, u, T ).

Step 3. Compute the average density, momentum and energy ﬂuxes at the cell boundaries,

from which one computes {ρn+1, un+1, T n+1}.

This procedure is an illustration of several of the key ingredients that we use in the general
framework that we will discuss below: the selection of an overall macroscale scheme which
in the present example is the ﬁnite volume method; the estimation of the macroscale data,
here the ﬂux, using the Godunov procedure which consists of the steps of reconstruction,
microscale evolution and averaging; the cost reduction at the microscale evolution step by
restricting to a small subset of the computational domain.

The examples we discussed so far belong to the class of problems referred to as type B
problems in [21] where microscopic models are used to supply a closure to the macroscopic
models. Another wide class of problems, called type A problems in [21] consist of problems
with defects, interfaces or singularities, for which conventional macroscopic models are ac-
curate enough away from the defects, and more detailed microscopic models are necessary
near the defects. Type A problems are found in crack propagation, contact line dynamics,
triple junctions, grain boundary motion, dislocation dynamics, etc.

This short review of existing work is by no means comprehensive. For the convenience

of the reader, we include at the end an extensive list of references.

2 Relations between Macroscopic and Microscopic Mod-

els

Let us ﬁrst ﬁx the notations. We will denote the macroscopic and microscopic state variables
as U and u, deﬁned on D and D, respectively. Typically D is the physical space. As we
will explain below using examples, it is convenient to view D loosely as a ﬁber bundle over
D, where the ﬁber Dx over x ∈ D, is roughly the space of microstructures at x. The
macroscopic and microscopic state variables are connected by a compression operator Q,
and a reconstruction operator R

Qu = U, RU = u, QR = I

4

where I is the identity operator. Typically there is a natural way to deﬁne Q. But R is
certainly not unique.

To illustrate these notions and notations, let us consider a few examples.

1. For the ﬁrst example we will consider the case when the macroscopic variables are
the hydrodynamic variables of density, velocity and temperature (ρ, u, T ), and the
microscopic variable is the one particle phase space distribution function f . In this
case D is the physical space-time domain of interest, D = D × R3, Dx = R3, the
momentum space which represents the microstructures in this problem. Q is deﬁned
by

ρ(x, t) =

f (v, x, t)dv,

u(x, t) =

f (v, x, t)vdv, T (x, t) =

f (v, x, t)|v−u|2dv

ZR3

2. For our second example, we will take the microscopic model to be the kinetic mod-
els of rod-like molecules in liquid crystals, [18] where the microscopic variable is the
orientation-position distribution function f (x, m, t), (x, t) ∈ D, m ∈ S2, the unit
sphere. Here D = D × S2, Dx = S2. The macroscopic model is the Landau-de Gennes
type models with tensorial order parameter S which is our macroscopic variable. Q is
deﬁned as

S(x, t) =

m ⊗ m −

f (x, m, t)dm

ZS2
3. For the third example, we take the standard homogenization problem

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

where a(x, y) is smooth and periodic in y with period 1. In this case, the macroscopic
variable will be the local space-time averages of uε:

where |C| denotes the area of c on which the averaging is taken. Dx = (x, t) + C. The
size of C should be larger than ε.

4. Our last example is front propagation described by Ginzburg-Landau equations

To deﬁne the macroscopic variables, observe that uε is close to ±1 in most of the
physical domain D, except in a thin region of thickness O(ε) where sharp transition

between ±1 takes place. Since the fast reaction term vanishes at three values −1, 0, +1,
it is natural to deﬁne U by:

U(x, t) = Quε(x, t) =

1 if uε(x, t) > 0
0 if uε(x, t) = 0
−1 if uε(x, t) < 0




An equivalent deﬁnition of U is via the 0 level set of uε.



More examples are disscussed in [21].

In the following we will concentrate on problems of type B, namely problems for which
there exist a set of macroscopic variables that obey closed macroscopic models, but the
macroscopic models are not explicitly available. We will describe general computational
methodologies that enable us to do numerical computations eﬃciently based on the under-
lying microscopic models. We will comment on problems of type A at the end.

3 Abstract Formulations

A key component of HMM is the estimation of macroscale data using the microscale model.
To see how this can be done, it is helpful to ﬁrst give an abstract formulation of the macro-
scopic model in terms of the microscopic model. We start with variational problems.

Consider a microscopic variational problem

where ω is some function space over D, the physical space. Let Q be the compression
operator. Q maps ω to Ω, a function space over D. Since

system. There are at two important time scales in our problem: tR, the relaxation time
scale of the microscopic process, and tM , the macroscopic time scale of interest. Our basic
assumption that there exists a well-deﬁned macroscopic model over the macroscopic time
scale of interest implies that tR ≪ tM .

Denote by R an appropriately chosen reconstruction operator. Given U ∈ Ω, let

Obviously S(t)U depends on R as it is deﬁned. However, since tR ≪ tM , we expect that
the dependence on R diminishes for t ≫ tR. Therefore we can deﬁne the macroscopic model
approximately as

(10)

(11)

S(t)U = Qs(t)RU

Ut = F (U)

F (U) =

S(△t)U − U
△t

where

with appropriately chosen △t, tR ≪ △t ≪ tM .

4 The Structure of HMM

Our basic numerical strategy is now as follows. We will work with a macroscopic grid that
adequately resolve the macroscopic problem, but do not necessarily resolve the microscopic
problem, and we will attempt to solve directly the macroscopic model (11) and (8).

There are two main components in the heterogeneous multiscale method: An overall
macroscopic scheme for U and estimating the missing macroscopic data from the microscopic
model.

4.1 The Overall Macroscopic Scheme

The right overall macroscopic scheme depends on the nature of the problem and typically
there are more than one choice. For variational problems, we can use the standard ﬁnite
element method. In fact our examples in the next section use the standard piecewise linear
ﬁnite element method. For dynamic problems that are conservative, we may use the methods
[44]). Examples include the Godunov
developed for nonlinear conservation laws (see, e.g.
scheme, Lax-Friedrichs scheme, and the discontinuous Galerkin method. For dynamic prob-
lems that are non-conservative, one could simply use a standard ODE solver, such as the
forward Euler or the Runge-Kutta method, coupled with the force estimator that we discuss
below.

7

4.2 Estimation of the Macroscopic Data

After selecting the overall macroscopic scheme, we face the diﬃculty that not all data for the
macro scheme are available since the underlying macro model is not explicitly known. The
next component of HMM is to estimate such missing data from the microscopic model. This
is done by solving the micro model locally subject to the constraint that ˜Qu = U where ˜Q is
the approximation to Q and U is the current macro state. For example, for the variational
homogenization problem, the missing data is the stiﬀness matrix for the macro model. As we
explain in the next section, this data can be estimated by solving the original microscopic
variational homogenization problem on a unit cell in each element of the triangulation,
subject to the constraint that ˜Qu = U. For dynamic problems, such data can be estimated
from a Godunov procedure, namely, that we ﬁrst reconstruct the micro state from U, and
evolve the micro state subject to the constraint that ˜Qu = U, and then estimate the missing
data from u. The missing data can be either the forces or ﬂuxes, or a part of the forces or
ﬂuxes such as the eddy viscosity term in a turbulence model. We also have the option of
carrying out a number of such microscopic calculations (e.g. with diﬀerent reconstruction
or diﬀerent realization of the randomness) and extract a more accurate estimate from the
collection of microscopic calculations.

To illustrate the selection of the macroscale scheme and the estimation of missing macroscale
data from microscale models, we will discuss some examples in more detail.

the next section. For the stochastic homogenization problem, ∆xi should be larger
than the correlation length. In this case, it may also be of advantageous to perform

5. Spin-exchange models via Kawasaki dynamics [64].

Other examples may include models of phase segregation, mixtures of binary ﬂuids, elastic
eﬀects, etc. The macroscale models are of the type

Ut + ∇ · J = 0

(12)

where U is in general a vectorial macroscale variable, J may depend on x, U, ∇U, etc.

The macroscale scheme can be either a ﬁnite volume method, such as the Godunov
scheme, or a ﬁnite element method, such as the discontinuous Galerkin method. We will
discuss here the ﬁnite volume method. HMM based on the discontinuous Galerkin method
is considered in [23].

The missing macroscale data for a ﬁnite volume method for (12) is the macroscale ﬂux J

}, with initial state

{˜u}, and subject to the constraint that

4. Evaluate the macroscale ﬂux {Jj+ 1

} using {u(t)}.

The constraint ˜Qu = U requires some additional comment. Take the example of molecular
dynamics. If we would like to capture the macroscale behavior at the level of Euler’s equa-
tions, the constraint is simply that the average mass, momentum and energy should be given
by the prescribed macroscale values given by {U n}. If we would like to capture the viscous
or higher order eﬀects, we also need to constrain the system such that the average density,

˜Qu(t) = U

10

momentum and energy gradients be given by the macroscale values. This is less convenient
to implement, particularly if higher order gradients are required. The discontinuous Galerkin
formulation proposed in [23] avoids this diﬃculty.

The rules for selecting {∆j+ 1

} is the same as for the variational problems. As usual for

∂tuε =

2. Spin ﬂip models [33] that leads to Ginzburg-Landau type of equations.

In this case, we write the macroscale model as

Ut = F (U)

where F (U) can be a nonlinear operator acting on U. For the macroscale scheme, we choose
an ODE solver on a grid, such as forward Euler or Runge-Kutta, and we need to estimate
F (U) on the macro grid.

For each macro grid point xj, we again select a microcell ∆j around xj. The principle for
j }, we construct a piecewise polynomial of k-th
j (x). The rest of the steps are the same as that for the conservative

selecting ∆j is the same as before. From {U n
order in ∆j denoted by U n
systems. We note that the constraint ˜Qu = U can be interpreted as

(u(x) − U n

Z∆j

for 0 ≤ m ≤ k.

4. Macroscale Markov Chains
When the macroscale process is a Markov chain, it is natural to use a kinetic Monte Carlo
method as the macroscale scheme. The missing data might be the transition rates between
macro states. Estimating such data is a rather non-trivial task. It is discussed in [26].

In the following, for dynamic problems we will concentrate on the simplest case when
the macroscopic scheme itself is a Godunov scheme and the missing data is the macroscopic
forces. Extension to more general situations will be studied in [22].

5 Compression Techniques

The key numerical problem now is how to construct approximations to E(U) and F (U). In
this section, we review numerical techniques for eﬃciently approximating E(U) and F (U)
by exploiting the separation of spatial/temporal scales.

5.1 Compression in the Spatial Domain

If the macroscopic and microscopic spatial scales are separated, we can eﬀectively reduce
the approximation of E(U) and F (U) to a unit of microscopic size on each macroscopic cell.
Such an idea is embodied in e.g. the quasi-continuum method. We will illustrate this with
some examples.

In this example, the computation on the microscale model is reduced to a microscopic unit-
cell problem on each macroscopic element.

The complexity of this method is comparable to solving directly the homogenized equa-
tion by evaluating the coeﬃcients of the homogenized equations on each element. This is
the minimal one can hope for. However, our method diﬀers from solving the homogenized
equation in one essential aspect: Our method is based on the ﬁnite ε-microscale model, not
the homogenized equation which represents the ε → 0 limit. Consequently our method can
be readily extended to more complex problem such as the nonlinear homogenization problem
at essentially the same cost.

This is a way of doing nonlinear elasticity calculations using only atomic potentials.
Denote by x1, x2, . . . xN the positions of all the individual atoms in a crystal. At zero tem-
puerature, the position of the atoms are determined by

min

subject to appropriate boundary conditions. Here f is the external force, ui is the displace-
ment of the i-th atom, V is the interaction potential between the atoms.

Quasi-continuum method works with a macroscopic triangulation of the crystal and a
standard piecewise linear ﬁnite element space for the displacement ﬁeld. The compression
opeartor is deﬁned in a similar way as in (14): Qu = U ∈ VH if

< ∇u >K=

∇Udx

1
|K|

ZK

(20)

for all K ∈ TH, where < ∇u >K denotes the average strain of the atoms on the element K.
Having deﬁned Q, E(U) is deﬁned as in Section 3.

To approximate E(U), Tadmor et.al. uses the Cauchy-Born rule. Given U ∈ VH, let
eK(U) be the potential energy of a unit cell of the crystal subject to the uniform strain ∇U
on K. Let

˜E(U) =

nKeK(U) −

f (x)U(x)dx

(21)

K
X

ZD

where nK is the number of unit cells on K. ˜E(U) is the approximation of E(U).

Quasi-continuum method contains an additional element for dealing with defects and
interfaces in crystals, i.e. type A problems, by replacing the Cauchy-Born rule with a full-
atom calculation on elements near the defects and interfaces. We will return to this later.

5.2 Compression in the temporal domain

By resorting to the microscopic model in order to simulate the macroscopic dynamics, we are
forced to resolve the microscopic times scales which are not of interest. This is particularly
expensive if tR ≪ tM . However in this case we can explore this time scale separation to
reduce the computational cost in the temporal domain.

It is helpful to distinguish two diﬀerent scenarios by which relaxation to local equilibrium
takes place. For some problems, such as the parabolic homogenization problem (22) and the
Boltzmann equation, we have strong convergence to equilibrium. No temporal or ensemble
averaging is necessary for the convergence of the physical observables. For other problems,
such as the advection homogenization problem and molecular dynamics, convergence to
equilibrium is in the sense of distributions, i.e. physical observables converge to their local
equilibrium values after time or ensemble averaging. Let us express the approximate F (U),
called a F -estimator, in the form

where the weights {ψj} should satisfy

˜F (U) = Q

ψjf (uj)

k

j=1
X

ψj = 1

k

j=1
X

uj is the computed microscopic state at microscopic time step j, and u0 = RU where R
is some reconstruction operator. The selection of the weights in the F -estimator crucially
depends on the nature of this convergence. In particular we note two special choices. The
ﬁrst is: ψk = 1 and ψj = 0 for j < k. This is suitable when we have strong convergence to
equilibrium. The second choice is: ψj = 1
k , for 1 ≤ j ≤ k. This is more suited for the case
when we have weak convergence to local equilibrium. More accurate choices of the weights
are discussed in [22]. The time interval on which the microscopic model has to be solved
depends on how fast the transient introduced by the reconstruction step dies out.

Consider the parabolic homogenization problem

on D, with Dirichlet boundary condition uε|∂D = 0. To approximate the macroscopic behav-
ior of uε, we will work with a macroscopic grid of size (∆x, ∆t). Let U = Quε be the moving
cell averages of uε over a cell of size ∆x. Let R be the piecewise linear reconstruction. In
one-dimension, this is RU(x) = Uj + Uj+1−Uj
(x − xj), for x ∈ [j∆x, (j + 1)∆x]. With this
reconstruction, we proceed with the microscopic solver. Asymptotic analysis suggests that

∆x

(cid:17)

14

the relaxation time for this problem is O(ε2) [6]. We plot in Figure 1 a typical behavior of
∇uε(x, t) at a cell boundary over the time interval
the microscopic ﬂux jε(x, t) = a
[tn, tn + ∆t] as a function of the micro time steps. It is quite clear that jε(x, t) quickly settles
down (after about 35 micro time steps) to a quasi-stationary value after a rapid transient.
We obtain an eﬃcient numerical scheme if we select this value as the macroscopic ﬂux and
use that to evolve U over a much larger time step ∆t.

The fact that the microscopic process only has to be evolved on time scales comparable
to tR leads to other possibilities of state space compression by neglecting the part of the
state space which does not contribute signiﬁcantly to the F -estimator.

In summary, we can express the F -estimator at time t as

F ε(U, t) = ˜Q∆t{f (˜u(τ )), t ≤ τ ≤ t + ∆t, ˜u(t) = RU}

(25)

where ˜u(t) is the solution of the compressed microscopic model (possibly over a truncated
computational domain) with initial data ˜u(t) = RU, ˜Q∆t is the numerical approximation of
the compression operator. Typically ˜Q∆t has the form

˜Q∆t = QeQxQt

where Qe, Qx, Qt denote the compression operators over the probability, spatial and temporal
spaces respectively. Having F ε(U, t), the macroscopic state variables can be updated using
standard ODE solvers. The simplest example of forward Euler scheme gives

(26)

(27)

U n+1 = U n + ∆tF ε(U n, tn).

6 Stability and Accuracy of HMM

6.1 Variational Problems

The analysis of HMM proceeds in the same way as the analysis of traditional numerical
methods, except we have to deal with in addition the eﬀect of compression. For variational

16

problems, compression gives rise to additional error in the evaluation of the macroscale
energy functional, or for linear problems, the stiﬀness matrix.

Take the example of the variational homogenization problem. The main error in the
evaluation of the stiﬀness matrix comes from the inconsistency at the surface of the element
where it meets another element. This error is of the order
L2. Consequently, one
has

△xk∇Uk2

Theorem 1. Assume that the ﬁnite element triangulation is quasi-regular, then

where U is the numerical solution of HMM, H is the size of the macroscale element.

(cid:16)

6.2 Dynamical Problems

For dynamic problems, it is helpful to deﬁne an auxiliary macroscale scheme, called the
Generalized Godunov Scheme (GGS) in [21]. Roughly speaking, GGS is obtained if in HMM
we replace the microscale solver in the data estimation step by the macroscale solver. Since
the macroscale model is not explicitly known, the GGS is not a practical tool but only an
analytical tool that is helpful for analyzing HMM.

For example, for the parabolic and advection homogenization problems discussed earlier,
GGS is simply the Godunov scheme on the macroscale problem with appropriate reconstruc-
tion and approximate Riemann solvers.

Assuming that the macroscale model is in the form of a diﬀerential equation Ut = F (U),

we can write a one-step HMM in the form

and GGS in the form

j = U n
U n+1

j + △tFj(U n)

j = ¯U n
¯U n+1

j + △t ¯Fj( ¯U n)

The basic stability result proved in [21] is that if GGS is stable, then the HMM is stable and

kU n − ¯U nk ≤ C(kU 0 − ¯U −0k + max
0≤k≤ T
△t

k ¯F (U k) − F (U k)k)

The notion of stability for the GGS has to be quantiﬁed appropriately for nonlinear

for n△t ≤ T .

problems. See [21] for details.

Noting that

kU n − Quεk ≤ kU n − ¯U nk + k ¯U n − Quεk

we now conclude that the stability and accuracy of HMM depends on

17

1. Consistency of GGS with the macroscale model.

2. Stability of GGS.

3. The compression error k ¯F (U) − F (U)k

We discuss each of these in some more detail.

1. Consistency of GGS and the macroscale model might be lost if the overall macroscale
scheme does not probe the macroscale properties to the right level of accuracy. For
example, if the macroscale model is hydrodynamics including viscous eﬀect, and in
HMM we have only probed the ﬂux in the convective terms by using a piecewise
constant reconstruction near the cell boundaries, neglecting the dissipative terms. This
results in inconsistency with the macroscale model. Other such examples are discussed
in [21].

2. Stability of GGS usually results in the standard constraint on macro time step size. It

may also impose constraints on the reconstruction operator.

3. The compression error has also several sources, e.g. compressions in the temporal
or spatial domains. The nature of the temporal compression error depends on the
nature of the relaxation to local equilibrium of the microscale process. In the case of
strong relaxation, no temporal averaging is necessary for macroscale data estimation.
In the case of weak relaxation, the temporal compression error depends strongly on
the temporal and/or ensemble averaging operator used.

[21] also pointed out the importance of averaging out spatial small scales for HMM based

on the ﬂux-formulation.

7 Conclusion

There are two important questions that have to addressed in order to design eﬃcient numer-
ical methods that couple the macro and microscale models:

1. What is the best way to set up the individual microscale problems?

2. How do we couple the microscale problems together in order to simulate the macroscale

behavior?

01-1-0674.

The second question is now fairly adequately addressed by HMM. The ﬁrst question is
tied more with speciﬁc applications. We have discussed a few examples. But much more
work needs to be done in order to understand the issue in the general case.

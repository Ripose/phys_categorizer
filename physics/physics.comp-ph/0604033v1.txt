Computation of Electrostatic Field near Three-Dimensional Corners
and Edges
N.Majumdar1, S.Mukhopadhyay1

Summary

Theoretically, the electric ﬁeld becomes inﬁnite at corners of two and three di-
mensions and edges of three dimensions. Conventional ﬁnite-element and bound-
ary element methods do not yield satisfactory results at close proximity to these
singular locations. In this paper, we describe the application of a fast and accurate
BEM solver (which uses exact analytic expressions to compute the effect of source
distributions on ﬂat surfaces) to compute the electric ﬁeld near three-dimensional
corners and edges. Results have been obtained for distances as close as 1µm near
the corner / edge and good agreement has been observed between the present results
and existing analytical solutions.

Introduction

Accurate computation of electric ﬁeld near corners and edges is important in
many applications related to science and engineering. While the generic problem
is important even in branches like ﬂuid and solid mechanics, the speciﬁc electro-
static problem is very important in the modeling and simulation of micro electro-
mechanical systems (MEMS), electric probes and antennas, to name a few. While
it is true that the ideal corner / edge does not exist in nature, the singularity being
smoothed by rounding corners, sharp increase in charge density does occur near
these geometries. Since the electric ﬁeld is proportional to the square of the charge
density, it is very important to estimate the charge density and the resulting varia-
tion of electric ﬁeld in their vicinity.

There have been many attempts at solving the above problem using the ﬁnite-
element (FEM) and the boundary element method (BEM). However, because of
the nature of the problem, signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to the basic method needed to
be carried out to handle the boundary singularities. On the simpler side, special
mesh reﬁnement schemes have been used while on the more sophisticated side,
the form of local asymptotic expansions (which may often be found) have been
used. Very effective FEM solvers have been developed [1] which calculate singular
coefﬁcients by post-processing the numerical solution. These solvers improve the
solution by reﬁning the mesh and changing the degree of piecewise polynomials.
Similarly, several accurate BEM solvers have been developed [2], [3]. For exam-
ple, in the singular function boundary integral method, the singular coefﬁcients are
calculated directly and the solution is approximated by the leading terms of the
local asymptotic solution.

In this paper, we present a solution to the corner / edge problem by using a re-
cently developed three-dimensional BEM solver [4]. This solver uses exact analytic
expressions for computing the inﬂuence of charge evenly distributed on discretized
ﬂat elements on the boundary. Through the use of these closed-form expressions,
the solver avoids one of the most important approximations of the BEM, namely,
the assumption that the charge on a boundary element is concentrated at one point
(normally the centroid) of the element. As a result, the computed capacitance ma-
trix is very accurate and the solver is able to handle difﬁcult geometries and charge
distributions with relative ease. The solver has been used to solve the classic prob-
lem of two planes intersecting at various angles. Exact solution to this problem
exists [5] and our results have been compared with the exact results. The compar-
ison is very good even as close as 1 µm to the corner / edge. Especially important
is the fact that the solver produces quite accurate results even for the case of an
edge. It has also been possible to reproduce the dependence of the strength of the
electric ﬁeld as a function of the distance from the geometric singularity. All the
calculations have been carried out in three dimensions and, here, we also present
the variation of the electric ﬁeld along the corner or edge. It is observed that the
electric ﬁeld retains its mid-plane value for much of the distance along its length,
but increases signiﬁcantly within 20% of the axial ends. It may be noted here that
for these calculations, only algebraic mesh reﬁnement near the edge was applied
and no other sophisticated techniques such as those mentioned above were applied.
This fact made the development of the solver and its application free of mathemat-
ical and computational complications. Since corners and edges play an important
role in many electro-mechanical structures, the solver can be used to study the elec-
trostatic properties of such geometries.

Theory

We have considered the geometry as presented in [5] in which two conducting
planes intersect each other at an angle b
. The planes are assumed to be held at a
given potential. A circular cylinder is also included that just encloses the two in-
tersecting plane, has its center at the intersection point and is held at zero potential.
The general solution in the polar coordinate system (r
) close
to the origin in this problem has been shown to be

where the coefﬁcients am depend on the potential remote from the corner at r = 0
for all r ≥ 0 when f = 0 and f =
and V represents the boundary condition for F
. In the present case where a circular cylinder just encloses the two plates, the
problem of ﬁnding out am reduces to a basic fourier series problem with a well

It may be noted here that the series in (1) involves positive powers of r
thus, close to the origin (i.e., for small r ), only the ﬁrst term in the series will be
important. The electric ﬁeld components (Er , Ef ) are

Er (r , f ) = −

am r (mp /b )−1sin(mp

Ef (r , f ) = −

am r (mp /b )−1cos(mp

m=1

Thus, the ﬁeld components near r = 0 vary with distance as r (p /b )−1 and this fact
is expected to be reﬂected in a correct numerical solution as well.

Numerical Solution

While the above theoretical solution is a two-dimensional one, we have used
the BEM solver to compute a three-dimensional version of the above problem. In
order to reproduce the two-dimensional behavior at the mid-plane, we have made
the axial length of the system sufﬁciently long, viz., 10 times the radius of the
cylinder. The radius of the cylinder has been ﬁxed at one meter, while the length
of the intersecting ﬂat plates has been made a micron shorter than the radius. The
length of the plate has been kept smaller than the radius of the cylinder to avoid the
absurd situation of having two values of the voltage at the same spatial point. We
believe that it has been possible to maintain such a small gap as 1 µm between the
circular cylinder and the ﬂat plates without facing numerical problems because the
BEM solver we have used computes the capacity matrix using analytic expressions
which calculate accurate values of potential and electric ﬁeld at extremely close
distances from the singular surfaces [4].

The cylinder has been discretized uniformly in the angular and axial directions.
The ﬂat plates have also been uniformly discretized in the axial direction. In the ra-
dial direction, however, the ﬂat plate elements have been made successively smaller
towards the edges using a simple algebraic equation in order to take care of the fact
that the surface charge density increases considerably near the edges. The elec-
(1.25p , 1.5p , 1.75p and 2p ),
tric ﬁeld has been computed for various values of b
referred to as cases 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively in the following section.

Results

In Figure1, we have presented a comparison of the variation of the electric ﬁeld
as a function of the distance from the edge as found from the analytical solution (3)
and the BEM solver. Computations have been carried out upto a distance of 1 µm
from the edge and to properly represent the sharp increase in ﬁeld, logarithmic
scales have been used. The computed electric ﬁeld is found to be in remarkable
agreement for all values of b
. There is a small disagreement between the two
results only at the point closest to the corner / edge (≈ 1.3%). At present, we are in
the process of improving the BEM solver so that this error can be minimized.

Although, the distance dependence of the electric ﬁeld is expected to match
with the theoretical prediction because the computed and the theoretical estimates
are found to match closely, in Figure 2, we have plotted curves corresponding to
p /b − 1 and compared the computed values as points against the curves. Thus,
we can conﬁrm that the computed electric ﬁeld obeys the r (p /b ) − 1 relation quite
accurately near the corner / edge. Here, to emphasize and visualize the sharpness
of the increase of electric ﬁeld near the singular geometry, only the distance has
been drawn using the logscale.

In Figure3, we have presented the variation of the electric ﬁeld at various dis-
tances from the corner / edge along the length of the geometry. While the ﬁeld is
found to increase considerably towards the end, for most of the length (≈ 80%), the
two-dimensional value seems to be a good approximation for the real value. How-
ever, the deviation (as large as ≈ 50%) from the analytic solution towards the front
and back ends of the geometry should be taken into consideration while designing
real-life applications. At close distances near the singular location, oscillation in
the electric ﬁeld value is observed. Initial study indicates that the source of this
oscillation is possibly the large size of the boundary elements in the axial direction.

Table 1: Comparison of electric ﬁeld values

In order to facilitate numerical comparison, we have presented the values of
the electric ﬁeld in the mid-plane as obtained from the exact solution and the BEM
solver in Table 1 for the three dimensional edge. We have chosen this case since it
is known to be the most difﬁcult among all those considered in this work. It is clear
from the table that the present solver does indeed yield very accurate results.

Conclusions

A fast and accurate BEM solver has been used to solve the complex problem of
ﬁnding the electrostatic force ﬁeld for three dimensional corners and edges. Accu-
rate solutions have been obtained upto distances very close singular geometry. The
two dimensional analytic solution has been found to be valid for a large part of the
geometry, but near the axial ends, the difference has been found to be signiﬁcant.
The results and the BEM solver is expected to be very useful in solving critical
problems associated with the design of MEMS, integrated circuits, electric probes
etc. Since these problems are generic in nature, the solver should be important for
analysis of problems related to other ﬁelds of science and technology.

Equilibrium properties of a hysteresis dimer
molecule from MD simulations using two-body
potentials

Abstract

Recent experiments indicate that electromagnetic hysteresis behav-
ior can be exhibited at the molecular level. Based on these indications,
a simple dimeric molecule with a hysteresis-like pathway with diﬀerent
spatial coordinates for formation and break-up is described and a MD
simulation using 2-body potentials and switches to form and break bonds
is implemented to determine whether chemical reaction pathways might
also exhibit analogous behavior whilst preserving conventional thermo-
dynamical outcomes. The results of various common thermodynamical
and kinetic properties are presented, where no unusual thermodynamics
is observed for the chemical reaction with the loop pathway which might
be interpreted as not being ”‘time reversible invariant”’ and therefore
susceptible to manifesting unusual thermodynamical phenomena. This
system may well model particles that interact via the electro-magnetic
ﬁeld to form molecules, since hysteresis behavior is standard and well rep-
resented in large-scale magnetic and electrical systems, especially in the
solid state. The potential switching technique circumvents the problem
of computer intensive three-body calculations which makes this model
particularly suitable for numerical investigations in both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium states where the details of a particular reaction mecha-
nism and its reaction coordinates are not the focus of attention. A new
algorithm for the conservation of energy and momentum is incorporated in
regions where the potentials are switched. The thermodynamical param-
eters determined include the standard free energy, enthalpy and entropy,

∗the initial theoretical conceptualization and writing up of the program and algorithm
development was done at Norwegian University of Science and Technology-NTNU, Institute
of Physical Chemistry, Realfagbygget, 7491 Trondheim, Norway during a sabbatical visit
2000-2001 ﬁnanced by University of Malaya, and hosted by Signe Kjelstrup. The method of
MD used here conforms to the periodic boundary conditions and thermostatting algorithms
developed or reﬁned by T. Ikeshoji and B. Hafskjold which is a non-synthetic approach using
very traditional integration of Newton’s equations of motion for the dynamics portion.

the activity coeﬃcient ratios, the equilibrium constant and the many en-
ergy distribution functions of the molecule, all of which are compared to
the Maxwell distribution function.Both the free dimer and atom particle
kinetic energy distributions agree fully with Maxwell-Boltzmann statis-
tics but the distribution for the relative kinetic energy of bonded atoms
does not, thereby opening to question recent far-from-equilibrium theo-
ries such as MNET that make use of this presupposition in a fundamen-
tal sense. The kinetic parameters determined include the rotational and
translational diﬀusion coeﬃcients and the Arrhenius parameters. Most
applications of rotational diﬀusion seem to presuppose a projection of a
value about the rotational axis (leading to a cosine dependence) but here
it is shown that an angular dependence is also a feasible model during a
ﬁrst order relaxation process. An NEMD simulation which uses a novel
diﬀerence equation to test for mass conservation is presented which shows
numerically that the principle of local equilibrium (PLE) is violated and
is at best only an approximation. The results suggest that although the
reaction is microscopically loop-like, unlike all the models routinely pro-
posed, yet the thermodynamics is entirely ”‘normal”’ and yields results
that do not contradict any of the known laws of thermodynamics. It is
therefore postulated that reaction dynamics involving hysteresis mecha-
nisms can occur in nature and may be experimentally veriﬁable, although
experimental interpretations tend to construct models that avoid such
mechanisms. A revision of the concept of ”‘time reversibility”’ to accom-
modate the above results is suggested. The general design of the reaction
mechanism also allows for the use of conventional potentials without hys-
teresis and this will be the object of future investigation.

Introduction

Recently, experiments have detected the presence of magnetic hysteresis behav-
ior at the single molecule level [1, 2]; synthesis of such systems are also a hot
[3]. Such facts suggest that non-single-valued functions are
topic of research.
involved in the phase trajectory of the system. A rational extension of this con-
cept, which has profound theoretical implications is to construct a dynamical
trajectory where the region of formation of the molecule does not coincide with
that of its breakdown. There has been a reluctance in the past to consider such
loop or hysteresis systems because of the absence of experimental evidence of
hysteresis behavior at the molecular level, and because of the inﬂuence of the
belief of ”‘time-symmetry”’ invariance which discourages such a view, which
lead to the construction of dynamical pathways which were both single valued
and which did not have any loop or circular topology; a detailed mathematical
examination of these common time symmetry presuppositions -so essential to
physics- has been made[4, 5] and it was shown that such views are often not
warranted or incorrect. This work reports a workable model hysteresis reac-
tion pathway which leads to thermodynamically consistent behavior, exhibiting
properties that will require new developments in reaction theory, and it also pre-
dicts the feasibility of such mechanisms in nature. It suggests a re-deﬁnition and

2

extension of the ideas of ”‘time reversibility”’ and ”‘microscopic reversibility”’
to cater for the proposed mechanism.
Incidentally, the shape of the poten-
tials and switching mechanism used here is surprisingly similar to experimental
discussions of the charge neutralization reaction [6]

except that the discussion does not explicitly mention the crossing over of the KI
and K+I
potentials at short distances (high energy) due to the ’time-reversal”’
presuppositions referred too above. The existence of a cross-over would make
the potential mathematically equivalent to the present treatment and there is
good reason to suppose that such processes can and should occur in electro-
magnetically induced reaction pathways (such as is manifested in charge-transfer
and Harpoon mechanisms). The dimeric particle reaction simulated may be
written

where k1 is the forward rate constant and k−1 is the backward constant. The re-
action simulation was conducted at a mean temperature which is high, T ∗ = 8.0
well above the supercritical regime of the LJ ﬂuid. There have been vari-
ous attempts in modeling chemical reactions with diﬀerent objectives in mind
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Some used generalized models with few details to predict
the main features experiments might reveal [7] at the reaction coordinate close
to the transition state (TS), such as what might occur within a solvent-caged
reaction complex: A-H · · · B ⇋ A · · · H-B . This particular pioneering approach
was further elaborated by Bergsma et al [12] in order to examine the limits of
validity of TS theory (TST) by not carrying out an ab initio study of all the
possible reactive trajectories,but by examining trajectories constrained to the
TS surface because of the limits of computing power. An example of an ab initio
detailed chemical reaction approach with a 1000 atom system using an assumed
3 body potential for the exchange process F + F2 ⇋ F2 + F is that of Stillinger
et al [10] who admits that the procedure is ’very demanding’ . At the other
extreme are generalized studies of hypothetical schemes [9] such as the ’chemical
reaction’ A + A ⇋ B + B used to elucidate some kinetic properties. Clearly in
such models, species A and B must represent complex systems that can be phys-
ically distinguished; in chemical applications, they might represent for instance
cis and trans isomers of some compound or they might represent mesoscopic
species. Some simulations do away altogether with the details of molecular
dynamics based on dynamical laws [8], replacing them with the Ansatz that
the details of the interaction between individual particles are not essential in
the study of the statistical evolution of the system. Such an approach would
make studies attempting to correlate the details of the dynamics to macroscopic
properties diﬃcult or obscure, despite the great savings in computer time, and
therefore does not suite the purposes at hand here. The objectives of the present
study include:

3

(a) designing a mechanically well deﬁned reaction model with low computational
demands and where the averaged motions of the dimer may be correlated with
the macroscopic kinetic and thermodynamical properties and where no anoma-
lies must be observed in the macroscopic results. Such an outcome would imply
that the dynamics are reliable enough to be used in other studies
(b) introducing some degree of complexity to the dimer such as vibrational and
rotational states for more detailed dynamical investigations
(c) utilizing the thermodynamically consistent model (as judged by the results
of an equilibrium simulation) in nonequilibrium simulations
Here we focus primarily on (a) above. To this end a new general algorithm
(which will be discussed separately in another planned work) was used to con-
serve momentum and energy.

The following essential thermokinetic parameters will be determined and

discussed in the sections that follow:

• The thermodynamic equilibrium constant through extrapolating the den-

sity to zero.

• The activity coeﬃcient ratio.

• The standard Gibbs Free energy, Enthalpy and Entropy of the reaction

through extrapolation.

• The Arrhenius activation energy and pre-exponential terms, which bears
no immediate connection to the potential of activation in Fig. 1, and the
rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions.

• The diverse probability distributions for the kinetic energy about the CM
(center of mass) for all the species, the internal energies of the molecule,
which do not have a Boltzmann distribution , thereby casting into doubt
many fundamental theories that assume the opposite (where is is noted
that the famous Eyring Activated Complex Theory (ACT) does not con-
sider the vibrational mode for the reaction coordinate to be active, thereby
not contradicting our results)and these are compared to the Maxwell-
Boltzmann distribution.

• Self Diﬀusion and rotational diﬀusion constants.

The method appears very promising for quantitative simulations of real systems,
and will be utilized in the years ahead for various reaction studies.

2 The Model

We examine the dimeric particle reaction given in (2) above

2A ⇋ A2

in a range of equilibrium ﬂuid states all well above the LJ supercritical regime.
This model resembles somewhat that of ref.
[9] except that a harmonic po-
tential is coupled to the products to form the bond of the dimer whenever the
internuclear distance reaches the critical value rf between two free atoms A.

Figure 1: Potentials used for this work

In the current study, the potentials as given in Fig. 1 are used, but other
conﬁgurations are possible, as veriﬁed by direct simulation, such as the excited
state conﬁguration of Fig. 2 and the reduced distance model model with the
same spatial coordinates for the forward and reverse reactions in Fig. 3. This is
a typical reaction potential and it is proposed that a quantitative simulation of
a simple dissociation reaction of a diatomic gas be attempted. It was found that
the equilibrium exchange rate of eqn. 2 was very low at lower temperatures and
changed rapidly at higher temperatures to a saturation level for the latter model
(Fig. 3), not making it very suitable for studies where rates of formation and
breakdown of bonds must be large enough for accurate statistics to be gained
across the MD cell over a wide range of density and temperature ranges; the
reason for the slow exchange is in part related to the small reaction or collisional
cross-section of the molecule.

The MD mechanism for bond formation and breakup is as follows. The free
atoms A interact with all other particles (whether A or A2) via a Lennard-
Jones spline potential and this type of potential has been described in great
detail elsewhere [13]. An atom at a distance r to another particle possesses a

The potentials for this system is illustrated in Fig. 1. Any two unbounded atoms
interact with the above uLJ (1-1) potential up to distance rf with energy ε =
uLJ(rf ) when the potential is switched at the cross-over point to the molecular
potential given by

u(r) = uvib(r)s(r) + uLJ [1 − s(r)]

for the interaction potential between the bonded particles constituting the molecule
where uvib(r) is the vibrational potential given by eq.(6) below and the switch-
ing function s(r) has the form given by eq.(7) . LJ reduced units are used
throughout this work unless stated otherwise by setting σ and ε to unity in the

7

above potential description.The relationship between normal laboratory units,
that of the MD cell and the LJ units have been extensively tabulated and dis-
cussed [13]and will not be repeated here . For the system simulated here with
the potentials depicted in Fig. (1), the switching function is operative up to
rb, the distance at which the molecule ceases to exist, and where the atoms
which were part of the molecule interact with the (1 − 1) potential uLJ like
other free atoms;bonded atoms interact with other particles , whether bonded
or free with the uLJ (1-2) potential. The point rf of formation corresponds to
the intersection of the harmonic uvib(r) and uLJ curves , and their gradients
are almost the same at this point; by the Third dynamical law, momentum is
always conserved during the crossover despite ﬁnite changes in the gradient,
since the sudden change of the force ﬁeld is between only the two particles
where the Third Law applies, thereby conserving momentum. Total energy is
conserved since the curves cross, and errors can only be due to the ﬁnite time
step per cycle in the Verlet leap frog algorithm,which would cause the atoms to
be deﬁned as molecules at distances r < rf . Similarly at the point of breakup,
there is a very small (∼ 10−4 LJ units of energy) energy diﬀerence between the
LJ and molecular potentials despite using the switching function in the vicinity
of the region to smoothen and unify the curves; the small energy diﬀerences
at the cross-over points are less than that due to the normal potential cut-oﬀ
at distance rc where the normal (unsplined) LJ potential is used in MD sim-
ulations. In order to overcome this problem, a new algorithm (NEWAL) was
developed, the details of which will be described in another work which conserves
momentum and energy at these cross-over points. If Ep(r) is the inter-particle
potential (energy) and Em(r) that for the molecule just after the crossover, the
algorithm promotes the particles to a molecule and rescales the particle veloc-
ities of only the two atoms forming the bond from vi to v′
(i = 1, 2) where

2(m1+m2) and ∆ = (Ep − Em) . Interchanging m and
p allows for the same equation to be used for break-up of the molecule to free
particles. For the simulations, success in real solutions for α for each instance
of molecular formation is 99.9 % and 100% for breakdown-where the ∆ value
in this instance is very small ( ∼ 1.0 × 10−4). In these simulations, we ignored
the cases when there was no solution to the quadratic equation, meaning no
molecules are formed at all, and the interactions are of the (1 − 1) variety. This
new algorithm coupled with shorter time step (from 0.002∗ to 0.00005∗ ensured
excellent thermostatting, where the thermostating was carried out at the ends
of the box, as is the case in most real systems. It should be noted that this
much smaller time scale is not unrealistic as the temperature for this system is
of the order of 20 − 30 larger than the usual values chosen, and so the trans-
lational kinetic energy of the particles would scale by the same order. In this
equilibrium study, the MD cell (which is a rectangular box) is divided into 128
equal orthogonal layers in the x direction, which is of unit length in cell units.

In this method of boundary conditions [13] , the ﬁrst 64 layers to the midpoint
along the x axis are a mirror reﬂection about the plane parallel to the other two
axis passing through this x axis mid-point. The y and z directions have length
1/16 each (cell units). This shape is chosen because non-equilibrium simulations
will concentrate on imposing thermal and ﬂux gradients along the x−axis,which
would allow for more accurate sampling of steady state properties about this
axis [14]. The layers that are mirror reﬂections about the mid-point plane are
averaged for steady state thermodynamical properties, leading to eﬀectively 64
layers. With this algorithm, with only wall thermostatting, we sample each of
the layers for temperature and pressure changes, and ﬁnd that the proﬁles are
rather constant, as shown in Fig. 4. The heat supply term (per unit time) are
zero to within the error of ﬂuctuation of energy. Without the algorithm, (but
with the same time step increment )the center of the eﬀective cell (layer 32 )
would have a temperature T ∗ higher than that of the thermostatted end lay-
ers by over 2 units, and the heat supply term would be signiﬁcantly negative,
implying a virtual heating up of the system at the middle due to the potential
diﬀerences due to the switches at the crossover points. The pressure too would
be unrealistically higher at the center of the cell, which is unphysical. The al-
gorithm above therefore is very eﬀective in overcoming these problems. Prior
to this, each layer would be thermostatted to maintain a constant temperature
and pressure proﬁle. conversion units At regions r < rsw, s(r) → 1 imply-
ing u(r) ∼ uvib(r), i.e. the internal force ﬁeld is essentially harmonic for the
molecule and at distances r < rsw, u(r) ∼ uLJ, so that the particle approaches
that of the free LJ type.Concerning the mechanism for the switching,in quan-
tum mechanical kinetic descriptions, switch mechanisms are frequently used
for describing potential crossovers[6], but from a classical viewpoint one can
suggest that the inductive LJ forces due to the particle potential ﬁeld (with
particles having a state characterized by state variables sLJ ) causes the internal
variables at the critical distances and energies mentioned above to switch to
state sM when another force ﬁeld is activated for the atoms of the dimer pair.
State sM reverts again to state sLJ at distances rb. The shape of the potentials
and switching mechanism used here is surprisingly similar to discussions of the
charge neutralization reaction [6] mentioned in (1) K+ + I
→ K + I except
that the discussion does not explicitly mention the crossing over of the KI and
K+I
potentials at short distances (high energy), although there is reason to
suppose that such processes may well occur, since the KI potential curve exists
at shorter distances well before the crossover point.The following values were
used here for the potential parameters:

u0 = −10, r0 = 1.0, k ∼ 2446 (exact value is determined by the other input
parameters),n = 100, rf = 0.85, rb = 1.20, and rsw = 1.11.

A molecule is formed when two colliding free particles have the potential energy
u(rf ) whenever r = rf < r0, at the value indicated in (a) above. This value can
be deﬁned as the isolated 2-body activation energy of the reaction and has the
value of 17.5153 at the indicated value of rf . A molecule dissociates to two free
atoms when the internuclear distance exceeds rb (which in this case is 1.20).
The switching function s(r) is deﬁned as

. The switching function becomes eﬀective when the distance between the atoms
approach the value rsw (see Fig. (1)).

Some comments concerning the MD potentials are in order. It is generally
not correct to assume that the potentials in Fig. (1) represents the transition
state theory (TST) potential surfaces; these surfaces can only be derived by
computing the actual potential of the dimer or free atoms at a known internu-
clear distance in the presence of all the other species: the zero density limiting
potentials of Fig. (1) cannot cause stable molecules to exist if they were formed
by excited atoms with total kinetic in excess of the zero density activation en-
ergy since if energy is conserved, the formed molecule would (except for a ﬁnite
number of kinetic energy values, depending on the model) have to dissociate
again to the atomic states from which they were formed initially. There must
be energy interchange at the potential well of the molecular species to remove
energy so as to prevent dissociation. This is achieved through the presence of
the temperature reservoir. This reservoir, if it is coupled to the system would
induce a system behavior whose limit at zero density would not be the same as
an isolated mechanical system. Likewise, all other state functions of activation
(free energy, entropy, etc. ) must be computed as functions of all the coordi-
nates of the particles involved in the interaction. The numerical magnitude of
these functions cannot be inferred from the isolated potentials above. It is sur-
mised that these are the potentials that must be used to determine via statistical
mechanics the various system properties, such as the equilibrium constant and
the state functions. Here, we extrapolate to zero density at ﬁxed temperature
to derive these functions, which cannot be inferred from mechanics only.

3 Thermodynamic results from equilibrium mix-

tures

The reacting mixture considered here were in thermodynamic equilibrium with
4096 particles. The cell was thermostatted at the ends of the cell maintained
at the same temperature. Typical runs of 10 million time steps were performed
per run at each general particle density ρ (where ρ is determined as a general
density irrespective of whether the particle is free or is part of a molecule),
where the ﬁrst 200, 000 steps were discarded so that proper equilibration could
be achieved for our data samples. The sampling methods have been previously
described [13] where sampling of all data variables were done each 20th time
step and where there were 100 dump values where each dump consists typically
of 5 × 105 samples which are averaged. The 100 dump values are then averaged
again to yield the standard errors of all variables. Dynamical quantities however
had to be sampled at each time step δt∗ = 0.00005. The thermostatting method
conserves momentum and registers the energy absorbed at the thermostats [15].
All parameters given here are relative to LJ reduced units, sometimes denoted
by ∗.

3.1 Equilibrium constants

In order to ﬁnd the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, Keq, the following
procedure was adopted. The concentration ratio, Kc deﬁned as

Kc =

xA2
x2
A

(8)

was determined as a function of average system density, ρ where the x’s rep-
resent number density concentrations. For this and other static quantities, the
temperature was set at T ∗ = 8.0. At very small densities, the system becomes
an ’ideal’ mixture, but as mentioned previously, the limit of the potentials can-
not be the same as the isolated potentials used in the MD calculations, since if
this were the case, all the molecules would break up, yielding a net zero value
for the equilibrium constant at the limit of zero density. As another project,
it would be of interest to determine the limit at which the equilibrium regime
breaks down in this thermostatted system,and to elucidate the theory when
this occurs. There may well be technical diﬃculties involved in computations of
very low density systems though . The plot of Kc = Kc(ρ) is shown in Fig. (5).
The accuracy of the Kc values varies inversely with ρ, where in the captions
sd refers to the number of standard deviations of the standard error. At low
densities, ﬂuctuations in Kc implies that any extrapolative method can be ruled
out, unlike previously (when NEWAL was not devised) when all the layers were
individually thermostatted and where a least squares ﬁt n order polynomial ex-

study, it was discovered that at very low densities, ﬂuctuations are signiﬁcant
as shown in Fig. (6) for the case of a run at T ∗ = 8.0. The method used in the
present case is to take the mean value of Kc for very low ρ values ranging from
0.03 to 0.09, for about 12 values at any one temperature and to approximate this
as K0(T ∗). The ﬂuctuations show that in this range of density, the system has
”‘saturated”’ itself in that all the ρ values yield approximately the same mean
Kc. The results derived for T ∗ = 8.0 are

in the LJ energy well for the molecule and the atom (see Fig.(1). It is probably
a poor approximation to use ideal models for test systems in reactor design,
which is often the case. Further, the above technique allows for the general
determination of activity coeﬃcient ratios via simulation. The determination
of separate activity coeﬃcients is a challenge. One real problem is the fact
that molecules, in the equilibrium state cannot exist in isolation. In mixtures,
either the reaction goes to completion, or they do not react in simple theory of
mixtures. In these cases one might postulate separate ideal states for the ”pure”’
components, but in the present elementary case, for any one temperature, there
is a ﬁnite value for K0 meaning the presence of all components in a system
at equilibrium. It it therefore a challenge to ﬁnd a suitable model or concept
to solve this problem with cycle changes. Even if a hypothetical state were
deﬁned, one must still design the route or cycle taken to the equilibrium state
which consists of product and reactant species. The derivation would require
a series of very elaborate and detailed computations and is not attempted here
since it is not immediately relevant. The rate constant is a deﬁned quantity,
which accords with the standard form below. The overall rate of reaction r may
be written in terms of the experimentally determined forward rate (r1 = k1x2
A)
k1→ A2 and backward rate (r−1 = k1xA2 ) for the process

It will be noticed that at very low densities, we would expect the errors due to
the breakdown process to be very much higher than that due to the formation
process since the number of dimers tends to a very low number.The ratio of
these values gives the the true equilibrium constant directly from kinetics as

An excellent agreement with the results from the previous equilibrium analysis is
found, where the method used for the determination of the equilibrium constant
diﬀers. This agreement indicates that the system is in a steady (equilibrium)
state and that the simulation method is fairly coherent. The Q and R functions
at other densities are given in Fig.(9).

3.2 Standard states

We use the form ∆G0(T ) = −kT ln Keq to determine the standard free energy
state ∆G0(T ) of the dimer reaction.The justiﬁcation is that we can choose the
standard state to be at constant pressure (of zero value) for the standard state,
so that the chemical potential standard state for each species is only a function
of temperature, so that ∆G0(T ) is strictly only a function of temperature [16,
p.177-179]. We repeat the same process as described above in section (3.1) for
T ∗ = 8 for diﬀerent temperatures (from T ∗ = 4 − 20. Each determination
required at least 8 runs at varying low densities.
It was found that at low
temperatures, the ﬂuctuations were greater, as shown in Fig (10)where the
variation of Keq versus 1/T is given. The curve used to determine the other
standard state functions was the Gibbs free energy curve , given in Fig. (11).
For this curve, the error bars (except for the ﬁrst data set) all refer to the

result. The ﬁt is rather good.The standard entropy ∆S0(T )is derived from the
thermodynamical entity [16, eqn. 6.34, p.182]

d∆G0(T )
dT

= −∆S0(T )

(17)

(18)

Clearly to use (17), we must know ∆G0(T )as a function of temperature T . We
write therefore a simple quadratic equation with p coeﬃcients as follows

∆G0(T ) = p(1)T 2 + p(2)T + p(3)

The non-linear least squares method yields p(1) = −0.0233441, p(2) =
1.0531305, p(3) = 15.46544989 with an overall uncertainly of the free energy as
approximately ±0.3. Diﬀerentiating (18) yields the entropy as ∆S0 = −(2p(1)T +
p(2)), which is linear. The standard enthalpy ∆H 0 is given at constant temper-
ature by the entity [16, p.183]

∆H 0(T ) = ∆G0 − T ∆S0

(19)

which therefore means that the standard enthalpy is given by ∆H 0 = −p(1)T 2+
It can be veriﬁed that this expression and that for ∆S0 recovers the

The essential point here is that the standard entropy is negative, as it must be
at moderate to low temperatures since the free particle state has a larger phase
space than the corresponding dimer. It may appear counter-intuitive that the
standard enthalpy is positive. It must be pointed out that at these temperatures,
the particles are not trapped at the bottom of the potential well, and that the
activation energy is positive, and that the internal potential energy at the point
of formation of the molecule is not lost, but is converted to internal kinetic
energy, leading to the break-up of the molecule. A quantitative treatment of
these terms has been attempted [17]. It must be concluded that the simulations
are able to determine the standard states without having to construct extremely
detailed cycle diagrams; further, the simulation can also check on the correctness
of the cycle diagrams used to determine standard state values.

3.3 Activation energies

From the way the algorithm was constructed for molecular formation, the molec-
ularity of the elementary reaction is 2 leading to a single second-order reaction
of formation, and for the dissociation of A2,a ﬁrst-order reaction results since
the molecule can only exchange kinetic energy with all other particles within the
system without further reactions to the dissociation limit. A frequently used
model for the kinetic constant ki for these rates is due to Arrhenius,which has
the form

ki = Ai exp

−

Ei
RT (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(20)

where the rate constant is a function of the temperature only and where Ai is
ideally not temperature dependent. It should be noted that the Arrhenius equa-

18

tion is strictly valid for 2-dimensional systems where the pre-exponential factor
is independent of temperature and where the exponential factor exp
rep-
resents the fraction of molecules having energy in excess of Ei [18], where Ei
is usually understood to be the activation energy. The reason why this form is
so durable is that the exponential term represents the fraction of excited state
atoms, and this term dominates over the pre-exponential term with temperature
variation, which give the impression of constant Ai factor for the plots. The
rate constants for the forward k1and reverse reaction k−1 were plotted versus
1/T for the given density of ρ = 0.7 and was found to be reasonably linear
(Figs. (13,14), with the activation energies for the forward and the backward
reaction rates (E1 and E−1 respectively) and the corresponding collision factors
(A1,A−1) determined approximately as

Very roughly, if the mean temperature for the plot (which spans from 4 to 20)
is 12, then (21) above yields for the given value of A1 bmax = 0.9153.. which is
reasonably close to 0.85, the theoretical value. However, ǫ∗ = 21.40, which is
higher than 17.5153, which is the set simulation potential value for the formation
of a molecule. Since we can expect a yet greater accuracy for the determination
of ǫ∗ as compared to Ai due to the domination of the exponential terms, it may
be safe to suppose that other factors contribute to the true activation energy
other than what is described by simple collision theory (SCT). Future work will
attempt to determine what other energy factors are implicated in ǫ∗; currently,
SCT views this energy as a pure mechanical work energy, which obtains at the
molecular level. Similarly, variation of Ai with various energy terms cannot be
immediately ruled out. Generally, the above values do not bear a direct re-
lationship to the isolated 2-body potentials of Fig. (1), but nevertheless some
approximate correlations are evident; E1 is somewhat close to the isolated ac-
tivation energy 17.5153 measured from the free atomic states,and likewise E−1
is somewhat close to the energy diﬀerence from the bottom of the molecular
potential at −10 to the potential at rb which is approximately −1, a distance
of approximately −9 energy units.However, for a ﬁrst-order reaction, a diﬀer-
ent interpretation for energy diﬀerences obtain than from that due to SCT for
instance, which is concerned with bimolecular processes; the ﬁrst order interpre-
tation is that the molecule decomposes when it overcomes an energy activation
threshold, and the fraction of such molecules is reﬂected in the exponential term,

20

the pre-exponential term reﬂecting the mechanism of the decomposition.

4 Results from equilibrium dynamical trajectory

analysis

This section concentrates on variables which had to be sampled at each time
step of duration δt = 0.00005∗ in order to compute the property of interest:the
rate of reaction in the previous section above is also based on instantaneous
sampling but more properly belongs to topics associated with equilibrium. Of
importance in nonequilibrium and kinetic studies are the values of the diﬀu-
sional coeﬃcients, reaction correlation coeﬃcients and the energy probability
distributions, where if the principle of local equilibrium (PLE) obtains imply
that we may approximate the values computed in an equilibrium simulation
for those in a nonequilibrium volume element having the same state variables.
Examples of these quantities (which can also gauge the appropriateness of the
model for nonequilibrium studies) are provided.

4.1 Rotational diﬀusion constants

Although connected in some ways to diﬀusion, a somewhat unconventional ’re-
orientation’ diﬀusion function hcos φ(t)i has been deﬁned [7] where φ(t) is the
angle between ˆR(0), the unit internuclear distance vector of the dimer at t = 0,
and ˆR(t), the same unit vector at time t. Such a deﬁnition might have appli-
cations in conjunction with their being part of transform functions [7, eqs.(17)-
(20),p.211], where the postulated exponential decay of this function when acting
as a kernel of the transform could force convergence of the function being con-
voluted. It is found that the exponential decay assumption in cos(φ(t))is a fair
but not perfect ﬁt, perhaps implying that another type of theory for ”‘rota-
tional diﬀusion”’ constants may yield even better ﬁts with the experimental
curves.We provide one such example harccos(t)i, an approximation to hθ(t)i,
which provides a far better ﬁt and therefore is a candidate for a stochastic the-
ory of rotational diﬀusion. This then is another area for research. It must be
mentioned, however, that the theory of ”‘rotational diﬀusion”’ as developed by
P. Debye and others [19, p.81-84,esp eqs. 49] etc. makes use of ”‘dissipation
kinetics”’ where a constant torque M is balanced by a inner frictional force ζ
parameter, so that M = ζ dθ
, where θ is an angular displacement. Such a
dt
theory leads to a relaxation in the distribution function f by a factor ψ(t) given
by ψ(t) = exp − 2kT
ζ t so that for a particular orientation angle θ, f has the
form f = A [1 + Cψ(t) cos θ]. The mean dipole moment of the entire sample
also decays with the same rate as with ψ. It is not immediately clear that the
orientation angle must also relax according to a ﬁrst order rate law. If the ef-
fect is a projection of an orientation onto an axis,then this would correspond to
the result given by Allen et al (op cit). O’Konski and Haltner [20] have char-
acterized TMV (virus) by studying the birefringence relaxation rate written

21

δ = δo exp(−t/τ ) where τo is the initial value of birefringence [20, eqn 3,p.3607]]
and the ”‘rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcient”’ Dh is deﬁned here as Dh = 1/6τ with
an additional factor of 1/3 to that of Allen. Most of these theories supposes
that even at the molecular level, one can use frictional coeﬃcients as for macro-
scopic systems where the retarding force is linearly proportional to some form of
velocity of the system , the constant of proportionality involving the frictional
coeﬃcients [21]. More recent studies experimental studies of rotational diﬀusion
[22, 23] assume a ﬁrst order relaxation of ﬂuorescent directed intensities of the
chromophore of the molecule with the rotational diﬀusion constant deﬁned as
in [20]. To show that the results obtained is typical, we graph the functions as
deﬁned by Allen et. al [7]. The method used here to determine hcos φ(t)i is to
create a table whenever a molecule is formed which maps out for each increment
in the time step i the value of cos φ(i) until it disintegrates: for each ith time
step there exists for each sampling subinterval M (M being a variable) values of
φ(i) due to other molecules which have existed, and the average value for each
M
sub-interval is computed as hcos φ(i)i =
j=1 cos φj (i)/M . According to Allen
et al (op cit), the function decays as

graphs the proposal found in [7]. It is clear that there is an initial chaotic
regime, followed by a very slow decay of approximate form A exp(t/τr),(A = 1
if we measure the time from the end of the chaotic regime onwards; ﬁtting this
portion of the curve from the 400 − 800th time step to the above exponential
yields τr = 1.38 ± .02LJ units. A ’rotational diﬀusion constant’ Dr = 1
2τr may
be deﬁned and the value obtained is Dr = 0.36 ± 0.01LJ units. The shape of
the hcos φ(t)icurve resembles that described in [7] (where the ’initial chaotic
region’ is mentioned) implying a somewhat typical rotational motion, but it is
clear from the ﬁgure that even in the ﬁtting region, there is an apparent concave
shape, as the tangent line makes clear. Nevertheless, for the sake of parametriza-
tion, this particular deﬁnition is used to derive the diﬀusion constant Dr data
at other regimes of varying ρ (at constant temperature) in Fig. (17) and for
varying temperature (at constant ρ) as depicted in Fig. (16). In these ﬁgures,
the same method of determining Dr was used as for the above determination
of Dr at ρ = 0.7 and T ∗ = 8. As with the case of rectilinear diﬀusion mo-
tion Dt = BkT , where B is the density dependent mobility coeﬃcient, which
is the steady state velocity acquired per unit external force [24, sec.14.4,eqns
(2)-(11).p.464-465], we obtain at ﬁxed density ρ a linear relationship with tem-
perature, suggesting a similarity or isomorphous theoretical construct in relation
to rotational motion. Noting that diﬀerent thermodynamical variable regimes
are associated with diﬀerent error margins when determined experimentally, we
also notice an approximate linear correlation with density at ﬁxed temperature.

From the rectilinear equation, this would be the case if the mobility coeﬃcient
B were inversely linearly related to the density of the medium, which is a very
reasonable assumption at higher densities (ρ∗ = 0.75 − 1.0). The ﬁgures show
that the change of the diﬀusion constant with ρ at ﬁxed temperature is much
less dramatic than with temperature at ﬁxed ρ.

Fig. (18) gives a clear indication that the long-time correlation is linear
concerning time and the logarithm of θ, and so one can also derive a rotational
diﬀusion theory where not a projected value, but rather the actual angular
distance relaxation is a ﬁrst order process. This, at any rate is what the model
here depicts.

4.2 Self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients

In these simulations, the mean lifetime of the molecules vary in the region of
24,000 to 2400 time steps as the corresponding temperature varies from T =
4.0 to T = 8.0. The accurate determination of the three dimensional (3-D)
self diﬀusion coeﬃcient Ds for any particle requires the determination of the
integral of the long time limit of the velocity autocorrelation function, or the
equivalent Einstein expression of the mean square displacement at inﬁnite time

respectively. We overcome the inﬁnite time problem here by determining the

maximum time possible before Ds,m,i
dimer).Likewise, we can monitor the time spent as a free particle of any labeled
atomic species (j), and determine the self diﬀusion coeﬃcient Ds,a,j (where a
refers to the atomic state). The molecular self diﬀusion coeﬃcient is the aver-
age of all molecules determined during the dump interval, and lastly the 100
dump values for the entire run is averaged to provide an estimate of uncertainty.
Similarly, a labeled particle is used to determine the atomic diﬀusion coeﬃcient
based on the time spent as a free, non-bonded particle. The results for this
supercritical ﬂuid are given in Figs. (19-20). The curves in Fig. (19)appear
very linear, verifying the formula Ds = BkT , according to previously developed
theories ([25], eq.(49) ) especially at lower temperatures. The ratio of molecular
to atomic diﬀusion constant is relatively close to 0.50 everywhere. The mass

of the molecule is twice that of the atom and approximately twice the diame-
ter, leading to this approximate ratio.The actual theoretical prediction due to
size, energy interaction and mass eﬀects is not well developed, and no exten-
sive data are available for even non-reacting systems. The reactive system here
depicts values of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient which is does not diﬀer signiﬁcantly
for systems which do not react.
In one study [26, p.2044 Table V]of solute
diﬀusion in a solvent, where interactions are solvent-solvent (1-1) and solvent-
solute (1-2) only, (i.e. no (2-2) interactions) the L2 system has the following

the diﬀusion coeﬃcients D1 = 0.082 and D2 = 0.190.
for the same mass ra-
tio, the diﬀusion constant ratios vary from 0.27 to 0.43 for very diﬀerent and
extreme ǫ − σ combinations where the variation with temperature is not signiﬁ-
cant for these ratios based on the scanty information of the graphs drawn; here
ǫ = 1, andσ = 1 throughout. These ratios are not too diﬀerent from the ones
reported here. The variation of the diﬀusion constant with density is much less
dramatic than for the temperature according to Fig. (20) with a slight decline in
diﬀusion constants with increasing density, as is to be expected as the mobility
would decrease.The errors appear large because the variation of the coeﬃcients
with varying density is relatively slight for ﬁxed temperature.

4.3 Energy distribution histograms and non equilibrium

results

It is of interest to compare the theoretical Maxwell distribution of the species
to the distributions derived from simulation since fundamental deductions can
be made. We also produce more results for a non-equilibrium simulation with a
novel diﬀerence equation which can be used to check for conservation of matter
to determine whether the principle of local equilibrium is indeed a principle
or merely a very good approximation for describing general thermodynamical
systems (whether reversible or not).

4.3.1 Probability histograms

These are provided in Figs. (21-25) for the translational kinetic energies of the
diﬀerent species probed as well as the total internal energy of the dimer. These
distributions are plotted together with the Maxwell distribution relative to the
apparent temperature determined from (27). The comparisons provide clues to
the following:

• Shape of the probability function P could perhaps be used to determine
whether the assumptions used in theories is reasonable or not.The shape
even for this equilibrium system is not always Gaussian, and so there is
no reason to assume a priori that non equilibrium systems must conform
to a Gaussian distribution where certain internal variable are concerned.

27

• Providing a rationale for extending the theory of equipartition in an equi-
librium system where the temperature relative to a particular kinetic en-
ergy coordinate is not the same as for the total system temperature de-
termined from standard equipartition. Such a possibility seems to be
supported by the evidence below.

which is the method used to determine the system temperature here. The

The Gibbs postulate can be directly tested for the chemical reaction system. If
this postulate is valid for loop-like hysteresis systems, then the time trajectory of
any indexed particle I must also yield, when averaged over a very long time the
result (in 3-D) 3kT /2 = p2

it does not obey the equipartition result above for the obvious reasons con-
nected to conjugate transforms.In statistical thermodynamics, the total system
i<j V (ri − rj) leads to the density-in-phase
Hamiltonian H =

coordinates, each kinetic energy coordinate Ek,i = p2

V (|ri − rj|) will have the above Boltzmann distribution. However, the ”in-
ternal coordinates” during a chemical reaction or other process refer for ex-
ample to an artiﬁcial aggregation such as the center of mass (C.M.) velocity
and position for particles k, l forming a molecule which is not permanent e.g.
mk+ml (rk + rl) need not have Boltzmannized dis-
Pj = pk + pl (k 6= l) Rj =
tributions. Permanent aggregated states can be expressed in terms of canonical
transformations Q = Q(p, q), P = (p, q)[27, Chap. VII]and the new Hamilto-
nian that results must by ensemble theory be subjected to the density distri-
bution described above. But for systems which are described by ”‘internal”’
coordinates of a non-permanent nature ( in the sense that the forces between
the particles cease when the molecule decomposes) and which does not refer to
the system Hamiltonian, no general theory exists, and no presuppositions can
be made to regarding its density distribution. Nevertheless, theories purport-
ing to be fundamental have been created that assumes the Gaussian density
for internal variables to be true [28, 29] without clear qualiﬁcation concerning
the situation when this condition obtains. A clear-cut counterexample will be
provided which therefore opens to question the aforementioned theory. Further-
more, the principle of local equilibrium has been proposed as essential [28] for
these new theories, and another counter-example to this is also provided, this
time from a non-equilibrium simulation. In other words, basic simulation is able
to determine the veracity of theories, and in particular, the hysteresis system
described here does not support the novel theoretical developments in ”‘meso-
scopic”’ level thermodynamics. The total internal energy coordinate (TIEC)
and the internal kinetic energy coordinate (IKE) are not Gaussian distributions
for equilibrium systems according to the simulation result discussed below. Of
great theoretical interest is that for cases of non-permanent coordinates, some
types of distributions are essentially Bolztmannized, others are not. It would be
of great signiﬁcance and interest to provide criteria which can predict when a
Boltzmann distribution can be expected. The apparent temperature parameter
< T >X may well qualify as a temperature in an extended equipartition scheme
if there is agreement with the Maxwellian distribution even if this temperature
does not correspond to the unique system temperature < T >sys. Here the de-
gree of agreement with the Maxwell distribution is either very good (in some
cases), or rather bad. It would be of great theoretical interest if some form of
relationship between the apparent temperatures could be made on the basis of
internal energetics. The uncertainly (unless stated otherwise) is of the order as
given in the error bars of Fig.(25)which is at 100 standard error units and which
would not feature in any ﬁgure where errors are typically quoted at 3 standard
error units. This ﬁgure corresponds to the TIEC distribution. The errors in
the temperature are are given in Figs.(21-27). Fig.(21) shows that the center
of mass (C.M.) kinetic energy follows quite accurately a Maxwellian P function

with a temperature parameter higher (T ∗ = 8.33 rather than T ∗8.0 ) than the
system temperature. The fact that the shape is Maxwellian at the indicated
temperature parameter does seem to imply that theories may be be developed
within an equilibrium system with diﬀerent coexisting temperatures provided
that these parameters require that a Maxwellian form regarding shape prevails,
and after that stage one perhaps might also be able to propose generalizations to
temperature not requiring a Maxwellian distribution; but a proper theory would
have to begin from ﬁrst principles which can subsume without contradiction the
previous axiomatics, including the Zeroth Law. Another inference is that the
temperatures have deﬁnite values (or limits), since the degree of scattering is
relatively low;hence one might expect some type of stochastic averaging which
yields exact values (limits). The other important scientiﬁc question is the expla-
nation of the shift of ”‘temperature”’ < T >X for such Boltzmann distributions
for non-permanent aggregates. An atom bonded to a molecule does not have a
clear Maxwellian shape, as is evident from Figs.(22-23) since there is interference
from the internuclear potentials. The graph in Fig.(22) computes the absolute
kinetic energy (K.E.(1))of the particle with respect to the MD cell or AKE ,
whereas Fig.(23) refers to half the relative kinetic energy and half the trans-
lational kinetic energy about the C.M. of the bonded pair,where the relative

for the two diﬀerent sampling techniques.

The IKE distribution, that of an internal coordinate, is clearly non-Gaussian,
as depicted in Fig. (24). This result is not consistent with the assumptions of
mesoscopic non equilibrium thermodynamics. [28, 29].

TIEC deﬁned above refers essentially to the vibrational and rotational kinetic
energy of the molecule Etiec since the translational kinetic energy about the
C.M. has been factored away where

Etiec = V (|ri − rj|) +

2 k(r − r0)2 . Hence the intermolecular potential would
play an important part in determining the motion along the internuclear axis,
with the environmental potential due to other particles playing a moderating
role by introducing stochasticity to an otherwise plainly mechanical system.

Figure 25: The total internal energy coordinate (TIEC) distribution as given in
the text. The error bars are for 100 standard error units.

The probability of occurrence of a state is proportional to the time spent at any
conﬁguration, and with a harmonic potential, most of the time spent will be at
the turning points in simple harmonic motion:in the molecular potential used
there is a ’dissociation hump’ just prior to the dissociation limit, leading to a
departure from the Maxwell distribution;other reasons for departure form the
distribution include the dissociation itself, precluding higher energy states from
being accessed. It is clear that the distribution in Fig. (25) is non-Maxwellian
and accords well with the shape of molecular potential energy function , with its
humped potential near the distance of dissociation. This model has been used as
a classic description of equipartition. If the particles were bonded permanently,
this quantity would have a canonical distribution, which it clearly does not
because bonds are formed and broken at a rate that precludes adjustment to a
Gaussian probability factor. This distribution , which also refers to an internal
coordinate for total internal molecular energy, is not consistent with some recent
non-equilibrium theories [28, 29].

Noting that the accuracy of the single particle is reduced by a factor of
≈ 4000 (the number of particles in this simulation), we ﬁnd that the Gibbs
postulate seems to be veriﬁed in terms of the shape of the P function (which
appears Maxwellian) as well as the computed value of the temperature with the
error estimated as ±0.1 by studying an atom of ﬁxed label (no. 29) as it forms
and breaks bonds with neighboring molecules, as shown in Fig. (26) Clearly the
time average of dynamical properties for this particle would equal the ensemble

average. We notice that the reduced accuracy of the sampling is reﬂected in the
greater scatter of the P function points.

Finally,since the molecular P function has been mentioned,it would be inter-
esting to compare it to the case of a random, but always free A particle which
is given in Fig.(27), where the determined temperature is slightly lower, (to
within the error limits) than the system temperature, and where the shape of
the P curve is Maxwellian. This particular species type cannot fulﬁll the Gibbs
postulate because its trajectory is conﬁned to those areas where there is no
molecular formation, and so its time averaged properties like the temperature
need not necessarily equal that for the system as a whole as determined from
the equipartition principle. We can conclude that the energy subsystems that
can be chosen for devising a theory of unequal temperature distributions in an
equilibrium system which all have a Maxwellian probability proﬁle include at
least the following candidates:

• Translational k.e. about C.M. for A2

• Fixed indexed k.e. of particle A (in both free and bonded state)

• Random, always unbonded k.e. of particle A

The following is suggested as a result the above observations.

35

Conjecture 1 If the random forces are external to the system, and they all
have the same force law when acting on the particles of the system which may be
diﬀerent from the force law for internal forces acting on the particles of the same
system, then the kinetic energy of the C.M. would have a probability distribution
that is Maxwellian.

The above conjecture is weak and must be strengthened by a more rational
theoretical approach using stochastic calculus.

4.3.2 NEMD results

Figs. (28,29) are the ﬂux and divergence of the ﬂux for ”‘Case 2”’ simulation
where a temperature gradient across the MD cell is imposed together with the
making and breaking of bonds at the ends of the cell leading to a molecular ﬂux
according to the thermodynamical conditions and details given in [14]. The cell
is broken up into 64 layers along the X-direction and the thermostats are placed
at the ends of the layers. Fig. (28)has overlapping error bars with magnitudes
that do not change signiﬁcantly over the range where the ﬂuxes are evident.
The stationary source and sink quantities are denoted σ (σf and σb are the
rate of formation and breakdown of the dimer in unit time and unit volume
respectively throughout the cell. The conservation of mass equation for atoms
and dimers read as follows, where the subscripts refer to the species label for
the ﬂow vector J and the concentration c:

dcA2 /dt = −∇.JA2 + σf − σb
dcA/dt = −∇.JA − 2σf + 2σb

(30)

The steady state condition is ∇.JA = −2(σf − σb) = −2σr and ∇.JA2 = σr
; (σf − σb) = σr where σr is a scalar ﬂux and at thermodynamical equilibrium,
If the PLE were strictly valid then the JA, JA2 ﬂuxes must

vanish; clearly here, this is not the case. To check for ﬂux conservation, the
divergence term is discretized by integration over one layer, using the trapezoidal
rule, where for any layer i,

i

i−1

∇.JA2 dV =

(σr(i) − σr(i − 1))∆V

= JA2,dif (i) = JA2(i)−JA2 (i−1) (31)

where the layer has volume ∆V . Similarly, for the atomic ﬂuxes,

JA,dif (i) = JA(i) − JA(i − 1) = −(σr(i) + σr(i − 1))∆V

(32)

leads to

Jd(i) = 2JA2,dif (i) + JA,dif (i) = 0

(33)

The plot of Jd given in (33)in Fig. (29)complies with the conservation law rather
well, within statistical error. We have therefore shown that PLE is not a rigor-
ous principle from numerical simulation where a counter-example is given, and

36

that local stochastic equilibrium dynamical variables do not necessarily have
Gaussian (Canonical) distributions as demanded by some specialists [28, 29, 30]
in their theories.

5 Conclusion

This study shows that the model of the molecule utilizing switching poten-
tials does lead to typical behavior predicted from standard theories for unusual
hysteresis-type reaction mechanisms which theorists have largely ignored, due
perhaps to the inﬂuence of ”‘time-reversible”’symmetry concepts. It is demon-
strated that microscopic loop-like pathways does not inﬂuence the macroscopic
thermodynamical results in any fundamental way. The method used here to
reduce expensive 3-body calculations to easier 2-body calculations may be used
as a basis for non-equilibrium simulation applications, which will be the subject
of further investigations. The two body potentials yield extremely good ther-
modynamic results whilst being super-eﬃcient in reducing computational costs
because the use of switches and algorithms that can preserve momentum and
energy during potential transitions, and it is expected that semi-quantitative
results at least can be determined for any molecular potential that is known.
The NEWAL algorithm is eﬀective for the extreme conditions of the simulation,

and would prove to be a valuable tool in reducing errors attributable to switch-
ing potentials. A whole generation of scientiﬁc literature has been devoted to
establishing necessary connections between the direction of material ﬂow (mi-
croscopic reversibility or ”‘time reversibility”’) and thermodynamics, but the
results here suggests that there need not be any necessary connection between
the two. Lastly, it is shown through counter-examples that the PLE and the
canonical averaging assumption used in recent thermodynamical theories are not
strictly correct since internal variables do not have the same algebraic structure
as the variables that are explicitly featured in the system Hamiltonian. We
have demonstrated that there is a feasibility of developing an extended theory
of equipartition (where the temperature parameters associated with any species
motion need not be ﬁxed and of the same value as the system thermodynamical
temperature) on the basis of the shape of the energy distributions. It would be
of interest to repeat and compare some of the above calculations for a conven-
tional system without hysteresis to rule out any necessary connection between
dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamic properties.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of
Sonoluminescence: Modeling, Algorithms and
Simulation Results

Steven J. Ruuth∗, Seth Putterman† and Barry Merriman‡

Dec. 30, 2000

Abstract

Sonoluminescence is the phenomena of light emission from a col-
lapsing gas bubble in a liquid. Theoretical explanations of this ex-
treme energy focusing are controversial and diﬃcult to validate exper-
imentally. We propose to use molecular dynamics simulations of the
collapsing gas bubble to clarify the energy focusing mechanism, and
provide insight into the mechanism of light emission.

In this paper, we model the interior of a collapsing noble gas bub-
ble as a hard sphere gas driven by a spherical piston boundary moving
according to the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. We also include a simple
treatment of ionization eﬀects in the gas at high temperatures. By us-
ing fast, tree-based algorithms, we can exactly follow the dynamics of
million particle systems during the collapse. Our results clearly show
strong energy focusing within the bubble, including the formation of
shocks, strong ionization, and temperatures in the range of 50,000—
500,000 degrees Kelvin. Our calculations show that the gas-liquid
boundary interaction has a strong eﬀect on the internal gas dynamics.

We also estimate the duration of the light pulse from our model, which
predicts that it scales linearly with the ambient bubble radius.

As the number of particles in a physical sonoluminescing bubble
is within the foreseeable capability of molecular dynamics simulations
we also propose that ﬁne scale sonoluminescence experiments can be
viewed as excellent test problems for advancing the art of molecular
dynamics.

1 Introduction

1.1 Background

As a gas bubble in a liquid collapses, the potential energy stored during its
prior expansion is released and strongly focused. The extent of focusing can
be so great that a burst of light is emitted at the ﬁnal stage of collapse. This
process can be driven repeatedly by exciting bubbles with a sound ﬁeld, and
the resulting transduction of sound into light is known as sonoluminescence
(SL) [10, 30, 11, 2, 24, 1].

Sonoluminescence can be observed in dense ﬁelds of transient cavitation
bubbles produced by applying intense sound to a liquid, or in a periodic
single bubble mode which allows more detailed experimental observations. In
single bubble SL, a single gas bubble in the liquid is created and periodically
driven to expand and collapse by an applied sound ﬁeld. The bubble begins
its cycle of evolution as the low pressure phase of the sound ﬁeld arrives,
causing it to expand to a maximal radius. As the applied acoustic pressure
increases, the bubble begins to collapse, ﬁrst reaching its ambient radius and
corresponding ambient pressure and internal temperature, and then radially
collapsing further, with the bubble walls falling inward driven by the rising
external ﬂuid pressure. The collapse accelerates rapidly, until gas trapped
inside the bubble is compressed and heated to a pressure that ultimately
halts and reverses the motion of the bubble walls. Thus the bubble reaches
a minimum radius, and then rapidly “bounces” back to a much larger size.
At some point near the minimum radius, the resulting internal “hot spot”
can release a burst of light. While the basic bubble collapse dynamics can be
observed for a variety of gas and liquid combinations, light emission typically
requires the bubble to contain suﬃcient noble gas, and works particularly well
in water.

1 INTRODUCTION

The mechanism of light emission from the gas is not understood, nor is
much known about related quantities such as peak temperatures, pressures
or levels of ionization.

1.2 Limitations of Hydrodynamic Models

It is known that the mechanical conditions during collapse of a common
gas bubble in water are quite extreme: as the bubble reaches sub-micron
diameter, the bubble wall experiences accelerations that exceed 1011g and
supersonic changes in velocity that occur on picosecond time scales. In order
to understand how this aﬀects the state of the internal gas, the standard
approach is to apply continuum ﬂuid mechanics. Some models assume that
pressure and temperature are uniform inside of the collapsed bubble [16]
while other theories calculate the eﬀects of imploding shock waves [1, 35, 14,
22]. Various ﬂuid models have been applied both at non-dissipative (Euler
Equations) and dissipative (Navier-Stokes Equations) levels of description
[19, 31, 36, 23].

All these ﬂuid approaches are limited in their predictive power by the
need to represent transport processes and the equation of state. Under such
extreme ﬂow conditions, little is known about these eﬀects and one is forced
to extrapolate from known forms. The net result is that the modeling pre-
dictions directly reﬂect these assumptions. This is not satisfactory for the
purpose of understanding what actually occurs within the bubble.

An especially fundamental limitation of continuum mechanical approaches
is the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e. it is assumed that
the macroscopic ﬂuid variables do not change much over molecular length and
time scales. Although the bubble starts out in such a state, its subsequent
runaway collapse ultimately leads to a regime where this clearly does not
hold.
In this state, from which the ultraviolet picosecond ﬂash of light is
emitted, one can question the basic applicability of hydrodynamic models.

1.3 Molecular Dynamics Modeling

We propose to remove the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium, and
also eliminate any controversy over the correct equation of state, by using
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the gas dynamics within the bub-
In this approach, we directly apply Newton’s laws of motion to the

gas molecules, including as much detail as is desired (or practical) about
the molecular collisions and related atomic physics. While this approach is
computationally intensive, it delivers to us a clear, physical picture of what
actually transpires during the bubble collapse. With the inclusion of suﬃcient
detail and eﬃcient programming, it could ultimately allow the simulation of
of the light emission process itself.

While the small length and time scales of sonoluminescence present major
obstacles for hydrodynamic modeling, they actually make it ideal for molec-
ular dynamics: precisely because the ﬁnal system is so small, it becomes

minescence is somewhat unique in this regard. Usually the systems directly
simulated with molecular dynamics are many orders of magnitude smaller—
fewer particles, shorter time scales—than the corresponding systems realized
in experiments or in nature, and this gap is too large to be eliminated by in-
creases in computing power [28]. In contrast, the number of particles within
the interior of a small SL bubble is comparable to the number of simulation
particles that can be handled with current computational facilities.

For example, a typical SL bubble driven at 30kHz has an ambient radius
of 6 µm and contains 2.25 × 1010 particles. At the extreme, SL bubbles con-
taining on the order of several million particles have been observed in systems
driven at Megahertz frequencies [32]. This compares well with simulations,
where we have been able to compute the gas dynamics of a one million par-
ticle bubble collapse using a run time of a few days on a single processor
workstation-grade computer. Parallel processing simulations would make 10
to 100 million particle simulations feasible. As the number of simulation
particles reaches that in real systems, the remaining computer power can be
used to add in more complex atomic physics, and thus allow more detailed
study of the processes involved.

1.4 Predictive Modeling Goals

The overall goal of the MD modeling is to generate a better understanding
of the processes that result in energy focusing and light emission during SL.
This is to be accomplished through a dual approach of model prediction and
model validation: we use the model to illustrate the phenomena that cannot
be experimentally observed during the collapse, and also to make predictions
that can be experimentally validated.

1 INTRODUCTION

5

The basic experimental unknown in SL is the degree of energy focus-
ing that is achieved inside of the bubble. For example, the spectral density
of light from helium bubbles in water is still increasing at wavelengths as
short as 200nm (energy exceeding 6 eV) where the extinction coeﬃcient of
water cuts oﬀ the measurement [1]. Related to the question of energy fo-
cusing are the detailed questions of whether there is shock formation within
the bubble, whether there is plasma formation, and what peak temperatures
are achieved during the collapse. For example, the most extreme theoret-
ical estimates suggest that the interior may reach temperatures suﬃcient
to induce deuterium-tritium fusion [3]. Over the range of parameter space
studied, shock formation and strong ionization appear to be typical, and the
lowest peak temperatures found in our simulations are about 40,000K, with
the highest approaching 500,000K. Our ﬁndings also indicate that boundary
conditions strongly aﬀect the interior motion. With a low, ﬁxed temperature
(i.e. heat bath) condition the peak temperatures and internal gradients are
higher than for adiabatic motion.

A key experimental observable in SL is the duration of the light ﬂash, or
“ﬂash width” [2], because knowledge of this puts constraints on the under-
lying mechanism of light emission. This can be used as a validation point
for any model or theory. For example, volume radiation from a plasma will
yield a diﬀerent ﬂash width than surface radiation from a black body. Since
our simulations do not include fundamental radiative mechanisms such as
atomic excitation or charged particle acceleration, our current MD model
cannot directly determine determine the light emitting mechanism or the
ﬂash width. However, a prediction about the ﬂash width can be obtained
from our calculation of the peak temperature as a function of time, assuming
the light emission occurs while the peak temperature is high. Our simulations
for Helium show that simple adiabatic compression does not produce a sharp
temperature spike in time, but the thermal boundary condition causes a spike
with a duration that scales with the ambient bubble radius. This result pre-
dicts that the ﬂash width should scale with the ambient bubble radius. If
valid, this scaling suggests that at high acoustic frequencies [∼ 10MHz] [32]
the duration of a SL ﬂash could be about equal to or less than 1 ps.

1.5 Outline of the Paper

The outline of the paper follows: Section 2 describes the model for the bubble
collapse in detail. Section 3 outlines the principle algorithms used to evolve
the hard sphere system. Section 4 provides detailed results from our MD
simulations. Finally, Section 5 concludes a summary of our observations, and
lists interesting future areas of investigation suggested by this ﬁrst attempt
at molecular dynamics modeling of sonoluminescence.

2 Modeling Sonoluminescence Bubbles

In this section, we present our Molecular Dynamics model for SL bubbles.
The overall strategy is to model the system as a spherical piston that com-
presses a gas of hard spheres, with energy deducted from the system for
ionization events at higher temperatures. The details and motivations for
this are given in the following subsections.

2.1 Model Parameters

We want to focus on the simulation of single bubble sonoluminescence, so
that results can be compared to the best studied experimental SL systems.
Such bubbles remain spherical during their collapse [33], and their behavior
is parameterized by their ambient radius (the radius they have when at rest
at the ambient pressure) and their maximum radius (the radius they attain
when maximally expanded at the low pressure point of the applied sound
ﬁeld).

We cannot directly simulate all such SL bubbles, since they may contain
several orders of magnitude more gas particles than our computational bud-
get can accommodate. Typically, we can aﬀord to do a calculation with some
given number of simulation particles, N, and the question becomes how large
of a bubble can we directly simulate. The ambient radius, R0, is related to
the number of gas particles, N, by the ideal gas equation of state

where T0 = 300K and P0 = 1 atm are the ambient temperature and pressure,
and k is Boltzmann’s constant. Thus we see that the fewer the simulation

2 MODELING SONOLUMINESCENCE BUBBLES

particles we use, the smaller the ambient size of the bubble being simulated.
Once the ambient size is determined by our simulation budget, we are
however free to choose any maximum radius. For experimentally relevant
simulations, the maximum radius Rm is chosen to yield the same ratio of
Rm/R0 [∼ 10] for the MD simulation as is seen in experimental SL bubbles.
This is natural because this ratio is a measure of the available energy stored
in the expansion, since the stored energy/particle due to the work done by
expanding to the maximum volume Vm against the applied pressure P0 is

2.2 Bubble Collapse

Since the bubble remains spherical during collapse, its boundary dynamics
are described entirely by the radius as a function of time, R(t). We are
concerned with energy focusing processes and gas dynamics inside the bubble,
and in this spirit we will take R(t) as being known. A convenient model of
the spherical piston that captures some qualitative features of the supersonic
collapse is provided by Rayleigh’s equation [24]

the density of the surrounding ﬂuid, and the initial condition for the solution
˙R = 0 when R = Rm. We emphasize that the derivation
to (1) is that
of Equations (1,2) applies only for small Mach number motion and thus
they are invalid as a fundamental theory for SL [9]. However, in this ﬁrst
attempt to simulate SL with molecular dynamics we are interested in possible
focusing processes within the bubble and use of (1,2) as a launch condition
appears appropriate since the resulting R(t) reasonably approximates the
gross bubble pulsation [24].

Consistent with this approximation, viscous damping and acoustic radi-
ation have also been neglected. At the next level of simulation one should
include a self-consistently determined boundary condition on pressure at the
bubble’s wall. In this way, energy loss due to acoustic radiation is properly
accounted for.

As a point of comparison, it is worth noting that the adiabatic equations
of state for the van der Waals pressure Pg(R) and the computed equilibrium
hard sphere pressure Phs(R) (the equilibrium pressure as a function of radius
as the radius is decreased slowly on the hard spheres) agree very well, except
at bubble radii near the hard core, as graphed in Figure 1 for Helium (with
the other noble gases also in good agreement, except near the hard core).

2.3 Gas Dynamics

It has been observed that for SL in water, the bubble must contain suﬃcient
amounts of a noble gas. Thus in many single bubble SL experiments, the
water is ﬁrst de-gassed to remove atmospheric gases, and then re-saturated

2 MODELING SONOLUMINESCENCE BUBBLES

with a noble gas to produce pure noble gas bubbles. We will focus our gas
dynamic model on this system, since it is a frequent experimental model and
also because it allows the simplest molecular gas dynamics models. Because
the gas is noble, it consists of isolated atoms that do not engage in chemical
reactions. Thus we can model it with simple gas particles that have no
rotational or internal vibrational degrees of freedom, and which do not engage
in any chemical reactions with the water walls of the bubble, even at elevated
temperatures.

Molecular dynamics simulations for such simple gas particles fall into two
broad categories, deﬁned by the way they treat interatomic forces. The forces
can either be given by a potential that varies continuously with radius from
the atom center (“soft sphere”), or by a potential that is a step function of
radius (“hard sphere”). The latter particles behave simply like billiard balls.
While the continuous potential are more physically realistic, they are also
much more costly to compute with. This is because numerical time integra-
tion methods must be used to compute the particle motions in response to
the continuously varying forces, and the time step must be small enough to
accurately resolve all particle trajectories in the system. Thus the motion of
a few fast moving particles will force the use a small, costly timestep for all
particles in the system. In contrast, step potentials do not experience this
problem because they evolve in time by a series of discrete collision events.
No explicit numerical integration is needed since impulsive collisions are car-
ried out only when atoms interact, and between collisions each atom follows
an independent linear trajectory. Thus each atom eﬀectively uses its own
optimally large timestep, instead of an excessively small step imposed by the
the fastest particles in the system. Moreover, there is no numerical integra-
tion error because trajectories are evaluated to within the roundoﬀ error of
the machine. [28]

Because of this diﬀerence in computational cost, it is desirable to use
the hard sphere model if it can capture the physics of interest. In our case,
we want to get accurate gas dynamics at mid to high energies for fairly
large numbers of particles. Whether hard spheres are suﬃcient to model
this regime in an SL bubble is an empirical question, but such models have
been shown to yield accurate predictions of noble gas viscosity from room
temperature up to the gas ionization temperatures [5]. We take this to be a
reasonable validation that a hard sphere gas provides a good model for the
gas dynamics encountered during bubble collapse, at least up to ionization

2 MODELING SONOLUMINESCENCE BUBBLES

10

temperatures. Near that point and beyond, it also seems reasonable that a
hard sphere model applies, since the softer parts of the potential are all the
more insigniﬁcant for high energy collisions.

The dynamics of a hard sphere system involve processing impulsive colli-
sions at the collision times. To illustrate, consider two particles separated by
a relative position r and having a relative velocity v. These particles collide
if their separation equals the atomic diameter σ at some time τ in the future.
If such a collision occurs, then τ is the smaller positive solution of

Extensions to step potentials that consist of a hard repulsive core sur-

rounded by an attractive well are also possible. See [28] for details.

2.4 Bubble Wall Boundary Conditions

When a gas particle hits the bubble wall, it might simply be directed back into
the interior by a strong collision with a liquid molecule, or it may penetrate

case, assuming the liquid is already saturated with gas atoms, the thermalized
atom (or an equivalent one from the saturated liquid reservoir) will ultimately
random walk its way back into the bubble interior.

For our MD model, we will idealize these two modes of boundary in-
teraction as either as energy conserving specular collisions or as a heat bath
boundary conditions.

2 MODELING SONOLUMINESCENCE BUBBLES

11

For the case of specular collisions, particles reﬂect from the boundary
with a speed equal to the collision speed in the local rest frame of the wall.
The direction of propagation is determined according to the law of reﬂection,
where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reﬂection with respect to the
local normal to the bubble surface.

For heat bath boundary conditions, when a particle hits the boundary
it is assigned a thermal velocity at the ambient liquid temperature T0, and
the direction of propagation back into the interior is chosen according to a
suitable angular distribution. We ignore the small time lag that might exist
between exit and reentry for the thermalized gas particle.

For the angular distribution, we use the cosine distribution, where the
angle of reﬂection θ is assigned randomly according to a probability density
function,

f (θ) =

(

(1/2) cos θ for −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2
otherwise
0

We have also tried a uniform distribution in angle in selected test cases.
This did not signiﬁcantly change the simulation results. (Nonetheless, we
note that there may exist situations where results diﬀer qualitatively since
a uniform distribution has a greater tendency to cause reﬂected particles to
build up near the wall.)

In reality, we expect that the physical boundary will have some charac-
teristics of both models. By investigating these extreme cases we hope to
see the full range of eﬀects that boundary conditions can have on the bubble
dynamics.

2.5

Initially the bubble is its maximum radius, (R = Rm), and particles are mov-
ing in uniformly distributed random directions, with the same thermal speed
vth(Ti) =
3Tik/m, where Ti is the initial temperature and m is the mass
of the particle. Randomization of speeds is not necessary, since the parti-
cles rapidly thermalize their energies in any case. For heat bath boundary
conditions, the initial temperature is taken to be the ambient temperature,
Ti = T0, reﬂecting the thermalization with the liquid. With specular bound-
ary conditions this choice generates unphysically large temperatures when
In or-
the bubble collapses to its ambient size, due to adiabatic heating.

2 MODELING SONOLUMINESCENCE BUBBLES

12

der to achieve the ambient temperature T0 at the ambient radius R0, the
initial temperature must be scaled down to Ti = T0/(Rm/R0)2 = T0/100.
The factor of (R0/Rm)2 approximately cancels the adiabatic heating (since
T R2 = constant in a γ = 5/3 ideal gas at constant entropy) during the initial,
slow portion of the collapse.

2.6 Hard Sphere Properties

The basic properties associated with the hard sphere model are the gas par-
ticle mass and diameter. The mass is simply taken to be the mass of the
noble gas atom being simulated. See Table I below. The choice of proper
hard sphere diameter is a much more diﬃcult question. The diameter should
represent the statistical average distance of approach of the particles during
collisions, and thus in general it should depend on the collision energy.

In our most basic model we will neglect this temperature dependence and
choose particle diameters that have been derived from the kinetic theory for
the viscosity of a gas at room temperature [17, 26, 25]:

Table I. Hard Sphere Diameters and Masses

To produce a more realistic model for higher temperature regimes of in-
terest in SL, the hard sphere diameter should depend on the relative velocity
of the colliding particles. A variety of models have been proposed to take
this eﬀect into account [5]. These include the variable hard sphere (VHS)
model [4], the variable soft sphere (VSS) model [20, 21] and the generalized
hard sphere (GHS) model [15] which is an extension of the VHS and VSS
models. In this report, we are mainly interested in contrasting how variable
and constant hard sphere diameters aﬀect our simulations, so the recent VSS
model is chosen for its combination of simplicity and calibrated accuracy.
In fact, we ﬁnd that the VSS model and constant diameter models often
produce quantitatively similar results. See Section 4 for details.

Ionization Eﬀects

Near the minimum radius of the bubble, collisions may become suﬃciently
energetic to ionize the gas atoms.
Ionization exerts a very strong cooling
eﬀect on the gas, since on the order of 10eV of thermal energy is removed
from the gas by each ionization event. Indeed, if such energy losses are not
included, Xenon simulations can reach temperatures in excess of one million
degrees Kelvin, while the inclusion of ionization cooling brings these peak
temperatures down substantially (see Section 4). This clearly shows that
some degree of ionization must occur during collapse, and that its cooling
eﬀects must be included for proper prediction of peak temperatures. The ions
and free electrons produced by ionization will move according to coulomb
forces, but the need to incorporate these eﬀects is not as clear, and their
inclusion is more diﬃcult and expensive due to the long range eﬀects, so

2 MODELING SONOLUMINESCENCE BUBBLES

14

they will not be included in this ﬁrst treatment. We will only consider the
impact of ionization on energy accounting.

For the purpose of energy accounting, an ionization ultimately produces
two losses: the energy of ionization is lost immediately, and the emitted cold
electron will quickly be heated to thermal equilibrium with the gas through
subsequent electron-gas collisions, thus extracting an additional one particle’s
worth of thermal energy by the equipartition of energy.

For our model, we will simply assume ionization occurs with probability
1 whenever the collision energy exceeds the ionization potential, we deduct a
suitable amount of energy from the pair. We also we keep track of how many
electrons each particle has lost, so that we can make use of the appropriate
next ionization energies and calculate the local ionization levels. The direc-
tion of gas particle propagation is updated exactly as without ionization. See
Section 2.3 for details.

More precisely, if the kinetic energy (in the center of mass frame) of
two colliding particles is greater than the next ionization energy of either of
the pair (which may already be ionized), that particle loses an additional
electron. We account for the net energy loss by setting the kinetic energy of
the pair to be

2
3 (cid:18)

E0 − χ

E0
E (cid:19)

where E0 is the original kinetic energy of the particle, E is the kinetic energy
of both particles before the collision and χ is the ionization potential of the
minimally charged particle.

Note that the ﬁnal kinetic energy of the pair is the initial energy, minus
the ionization energy, with an additional 1/3 deducted to represent the sub-
sequent energy lost to thermalizing the electron. This is not the only possible
way to include this eﬀect, and of course in reality this process involves losses
from other gas particles besides the colliding pair, but this approach is the
simplest way to include the eﬀect.

We also do not account for subsequent electron-ion recombination to neu-
tral atoms, although this would be interesting to include at the next level of
description. In particular, this could be an interesting source of radiation as
the hot spot decays.

For reference, the approximate ionization potentials used for the three

noble gases are provided in Table III below.

3 Algorithm

Eﬃcient algorithms are needed to evolve our hard sphere model for sonolumi-
nescence since a naive coding is prohibitively slow for anything more than a
few thousand particles. To achieve this goal, we modify and extend existing
methods [28] rather than develop new algorithms and codes from scratch.
This section outlines the principle algorithms used to evolve our hard sphere
system. Further details and basic codes are provided in [28].

3.1 Cell Subdivision

The hard sphere simulation proceeds according to a time ordered sequence of
collision events [28, 8]. But clearly a direct determination of the next event
for a given particle is impractical in our large simulations because O(N) work
is required per particle to examine all possible collision partners, where N is
the total number of particles.

Fortunately this work can be reduced to a constant independent of N
by dividing the bubble into a number of cells [28, 8]. By taking an edge
length that is larger than the sphere diameter, σ, it is obvious that collisions
can only occur between particles in the same and adjacent cells. Since we
want a relatively small number of particles in each cell and we want the
number of cells to be comparable to the number of particles in the simulation
the size of the cells must be reduced as the bubble collapses. We use a
straightforward subdivision procedure to accomplish this task. Initially, the
bubble is subdivided into approximately 8N square, identical cells. Every
time the bubble declines by a factor of two in diameter, cell size is reduced
by a factor of two (keeping in mind that we must stop the procedure once
the cell diameters reach the particle diameter). Note that we do not need to

3 ALGORITHM

16

recompute which particle belongs to which cell after each collision. Instead,
we introduce a cell crossing event and update a particle’s cell location only
when the corresponding cell crossing event is processed (cf. [28, 8]).

Also note that when a collision occurs, only particles in the immediate
neighborhood of the cell need to be updated. For this reason a ‘personal’ time
is stored for each particle, representing the time when the particle was last
updated. The entire system conﬁguration only needs to be updated when
properties (such as density, temperature etc.) are evaluated. [28, 8]

3.2 Event Calendar

Because we require information on when particle collisions, hard wall colli-
sions and cell crossings occur some sort of event calendar is needed. This
calendar will store many future events. As collisions and cell crossings occur,
newly predicted collisions and cell crossings must be added to the calendar
and events that are no longer relevant must be removed. [28]

Speciﬁcally, whenever particles collide their velocities are changed. This
implies that future events involving these particles are no longer valid and
should be removed from the calendar.
It also implies that new cell cross-
ings and collision events need to be calculated and added to the calendar.
(Fortunately, the only particle collisions that need to be considered are those
involving the current cell and its neighbors.) On the other hand, when a
particle crosses cell boundaries previous particle collisions remain valid but
the newly adjacent cells contain potential collision targets that must be ex-
amined. New cell crossing events must also be checked. As pointed out in
[28], there is no way in which a collision can be missed provided all these
details are taken care of correctly.

Of course, it is essential that the calendar can be managed eﬃciently both
in terms of memory and CPU usage. To meet this requirement, we utilize the
binary tree data structure described in [27, 28]. Here, each scheduled event
is represented by a node in the tree. The information contained within the
node identiﬁes the time at which the event is scheduled and the event details.
Calendar events are added or deleted by adding or deleting the corresponding
nodes from the tree. To facilitate traversing the tree, three pointers are used
to link event nodes. These point to the left and right descendents of the
node and to the node’s parent. The ordering is carried out so that left hand
descendents of a particular node are events scheduled to occur before the

3 ALGORITHM

17

event at the current node, while right hand descendents correspond to events
that occur after it. Finally, the rapid deletion of event nodes is supported by
linking event nodes into two circular lists. See [28] for details.

It is interesting that estimates of the theoretical performance of the tree
structure are possible in a number of instances [18, 28]. For example, if a
tree is constructed from a series of events that are randomly distributed, the
average number of nodal tests to insert a new node into the tree is 2 log N.
Also, the average number of cycles to delete a randomly selected node is
a constant independent of N.
It is noteworthy that measurements have
been performed to conﬁrm these results in actual MD simulations [27]. Our
sonoluminescence simulations spend most of the CPU time on compressing
the bubble from its maximum radius to the ambient radius. Since the bubble
is fairly uniform in this regime, the assumption of a random distribution of
events seems plausible and we expect that this type of estimate on theoretical
performance should hold. (On the other hand, near the short-lived hot spot
the behavior is far from equilibrium and this assumption on randomness
may be invalid.) A detailed study of the theoretical performance of the tree
structure will be the focus of subsequent work.

3.3 Average Properties

We need to evaluate spatially dependent average properties of the gas at
various times. To minimize statistical ﬂuctuations, we assume that the results
are radially symmetric and average over shells that are 1/40th of the bubble
radius. We calculate dimensionless values for density, temperature, velocity
and average charge as follows:

• The dimensionless density is given by the density divided by the average

ambient density.

• The dimensionless velocity is given by the velocity divided by the am-
γkT0/m where γ is the ratio of heat capacities

bient speed of sound
and m is the mass of a single particle.

q

• The dimensionless temperature is given by the temperature divided by

the ambient temperature, T0. Speciﬁcally,

where the summation is over all N particles in the shell, vi is the speed
of the ith particle and vn is the normal speed of the gas in the shell.

• Ionization is simply the average charge per particle.

• In each case we plot properties as a function of a dimensionless bubble
radius, r, which equals the physical radius R(t) divided by a constant
approximating the atomic diameter. For Helium this constant is chosen
to be 2.18˚A (see Table I). For Argon and Xenon these constants are
chosen to be 4.11˚A and 5.65˚A, respectively. (These latter two choices
represent average VSS model values at 273K and also approximate the
values given in Table I).

See [28] for further details on calculating equilibrium and transport properties
for hard sphere models.

4 Simulation Results

In this section we simulate the collapse of a sonoluminescing bubble from its
maximum radius to its hot spot. Our focus is on how boundary conditions
aﬀect the interior dynamics of the collapse. Results for Helium, Argon and
Xenon are presented.

The section begins with a study of the collapse of million particle bub-
bles and concludes by addressing how simulations vary according to ambient
bubble size.

4.1 Helium Bubbles with Specular BCs

We ﬁrst consider evolving a bubble of one million helium atoms using specular
boundary conditions.

With the constant diameter model and no ionization the temperature and
density increase uniformly as the bubble collapses to the minimum radius.
After the minimum radius is attained, the temperature becomes hotter to-
wards the center of the bubble and cools at the expanding outer boundary
of the bubble, with a peak temperature of about 80000K reached at the cen-
ter. (At these temperatures, it is clear that ionization events will occur so
the remainder of our simulations consider ionization.) See Figure 2 for plots

of the density, temperature and velocity as a function of distance from the
center of the bubble at various bubble radii.

With the constant diameter model and ionization we again ﬁnd that the
temperature and density increase uniformly as the bubble collapses to the
minimum radius. However, after the minimum radius is attained, ionization
causes the temperature to cool across the entire bubble rather than just at
the boundary of the bubble (although cooling occurs most rapidly at the
bubble boundary). A peak temperature of about 40000K is attained at the
minimum radius. It is particularly noteworthy that recorded properties are
nearly constant throughout the bubble when the peak temperature occurs
— See Figure 3.

Changing to the VSS diameter model gives very similar results, except
now ionization occurs less frequently because the eﬀective size of the parti-
cles is smaller. Because less ionization occurs, the temperature continues to
increase for a short while after the minimum bubble radius leading to a peak
temperature of about 45000K. See Figure 4 for details.

4.2 Helium Bubbles with Heat Bath BCs

Our next set of simulations evolve a bubble of one million helium atoms using
heat bath boundary conditions and ionization.

With the constant diameter model the density increases dramatically at
the edge of the bubble as the minimum radius is attained. Temperature and
velocity are also much more proﬁled than for specular boundary conditions,
with peaks occurring about 25 percent of the way from the boundary of the
bubble to the center. No ionization has occurred at the minimum radius.
For a short time after the minimum radius1, the peak temperature of the
bubble continues to increase (to a maximum of 95000K), and temperature
and density proﬁles become even more pronounced — See Figure 5. At
ﬁrst sight, it is counterintuitive that heat bath boundaries create conditions
whereby the cooling from the boundary leads to greater energy focusing and
higher peak temperatures. Perhaps cooling lowers the speed of sound and
enhances the nonlinear response to the high speed ˙R of collapse.

Changing to the VSS diameter model gives very similar results, except
now ionization occurs less frequently because the eﬀective size of the particles
is smaller. See Figure 6 for details.

4.3 Argon and Xenon Bubbles with Specular BCs

Our next set of simulations evolve million particle Argon and Xenon bubbles
using specular boundary conditions and ionization.

We start by considering an Argon bubble with the VSS diameter model.
Because the speed of sound is slower in Argon than in Helium we expect
Argon simulations to exhibit much sharper proﬁles than Helium. This is
indeed the case. Moreover, our simulation results are surprisingly similar to
those for Helium with heat bath boundaries: Density increases at the edge
of the bubble as the minimum radius is attained. Temperature and veloc-
ity are sharply proﬁled, with peaks occurring closer to the boundary of the
bubble than to its center. Also, for a short time after the minimum radius,
the peak temperature of the bubble continues to increase rapidly (to a max-
imum of 100000K), and temperature and density proﬁles become even more
pronounced — See Figure 7.

1Note that a vacuum forms at the bubble wall after the minimum radius occurs. This

is simply an artifact of using Equation 1 as the forcing equation for R(t).

Constant diameter hard sphere simulations of Argon are also possible.
These simulations are unique2 in that the hot spot occurs before the minimum
radius value of 58.2 — See Figure 8. As expected, this simulation gives
sharper proﬁles than the corresponding model for Helium. However, since
the minimum radius is close to the minimum radius allowed by the packing
of the hard spheres the results are much more uniform than those derived
using the VSS model for Argon. Also note that as a result of the collapse of
the bubble, energy stored at the maximum radius is converted into heating,
ionization and kinetic energy of the local center of mass. From Figure 8
one can estimate these quantities. The average temperature of the atoms
is 30000K which is a thermal energy of about 3.75 eV/atom. As half the
atoms are ionized, the ionization energy is about 8 eV/atom. Since electrons
have about the same thermal energy as the ions, their energy is about 2
eV/atom. Taken together, these channels add to about 21 eV/atom which
is less than the 25 eV/atom available in the initial state but the diﬀerence
is within the accuracy of the energy estimates. For Helium at the hot spot,
the energy of the hard sphere (plus ionization) is substantially less than the
energy stored at Rm. This can be attributed to the fact that ahs/a ≈ 0.60.
For Argon, almost all the stored energy ends up in the hard sphere gas since
ahs is much closer to a; ahs/a ≈ 0.91.
In both cases, inclusion of a self-
consistent boundary condition at the wall will account for any further energy
discrepancies. Of course, in a physical system, energy will diminish due to
acoustic radiation and thermal losses through the boundary of the bubble
and we expect this to constitute a strong eﬀect.

Simulations for Xenon bubbles with the VSS diameter model were also
carried out. Because the speed of sound is slower in Xenon than in Argon
we expect Xenon simulations to exhibit even sharper proﬁles than Argon.
Indeed, this is the case and temperatures of up to 300000K were obtained
despite the occurrence of multiple ionization (exceeding 4 per particle at the
center) — See Figure 9.

A proviso for the Xenon data is that these calculations bog down before
the minimum radius is attained when the constant diameter model is used,
whereas the Helium data is hardly aﬀected by this modiﬁcation. The ex-
planation lies in the consistency of the minimum bubble radius (∼ a) and
2This behavior may be related to the consistency of the minimum bubble radius and

the hard sphere radius. See the case of Xenon below.

the hard sphere radius for Xenon. Speciﬁcally, the minimum radius of the
bubble wall is less than the minimum radius allowed by the packing of hard
spheres. On the other hand, Xenon simulations carried out using the VSS
model are relatively insensitive to changes in a. For example, increasing a
by 30% changes the peak temperature by about 35%, and leaves the qual-
itative features invariant. Note that in this case, ahs < a as with Helium
simulations.

4.4 Argon and Xenon Bubbles with Heat Bath BCs

We now consider the evolution of million particle Argon and Xenon bubbles
using Heat Bath boundary conditions and ionization.

Applying the VSS diameter model to an Argon bubble gives results that
have the same qualitative features as the corresponding Helium simulation,
except that all properties are much more sharply proﬁled. Indeed, tempera-
tures of up to 300000K were obtained in this simulation showing (once again)
that heat bath boundaries create conditions whereby the cooling from the
boundary leads to greater energy focusing and higher peak temperatures than
specular boundary conditions. See Figure 10 for details.

Simulations for Xenon bubbles with the VSS diameter model were also
carried out. Because the speed of sound is slower in Xenon than in Ar-
gon, Xenon simulations exhibit even sharper proﬁles than Argon. Indeed,
temperatures of up to 500000K were obtained. See Figure 11 for details.

As discussed in the previous section, the constant diameter model for
Xenon is not able to compute down to the minimum radius since that radius
is smaller than the minimum packing radius of the hard sphere gas. On the
other hand, Argon calculations are possible. These simulations are qualita-
tively similar to the constant diameter model for Helium, but produce a more
highly ionized gas (reaching an average charge of +6 per particle near the
center) and much higher temperatures (up to 1.5 million K) than any other
simulations that were considered. Because such extreme values arise it seems
likely the constant diameter model for Argon also experiences a signiﬁcant
consistency problem near the minimum radius.

4.5 Flashwidths

An important experimental measurement for SL bubbles is the ﬂash width,
i.e. the duration of the light emission, because this constrains the possible

atomic excitation or charge acceleration eﬀects responsible for radiation, the
current model does not directly yield a ﬂashwidth.

However, an estimated ﬂash width can be obtained from the computed
temperature as a function of time. If we assume that whatever process is
responsible for the light emission is strongly dependent on the current tem-
perature, and that it does not appreciably alter the gross gas dynamics, the
ﬂashwidth at a particular color is simply the length of time which the tem-
perature exceeds the appropriate turn-on threshold. In this case, the peak
temperature as a function of time is our key diagnostic quantity.

Our simulations (Figure 12) show that emission from an adiabatic com-
pression lacks a strong, sharp temperate spike in time, and thus the associ-
ated ﬂash from this model would be longer and would be comprised of lower
energy photons. In contrast, the heat bath boundary conditions yield sharp
transient spike in temperature, and thus this model predicts a much shorter
ﬂash which is comprised of higher energy photons. In both cases it appears
that the width of the spike roughly doubles as the number of particles in the
bubble increases by factors of 10, from N = 104 to N = 106. Since each

factor of 8 in particle number corresponds to a doubling of the ambient bub-
ble radius R0, this amounts to essentially a predicted linear scaling between
ﬂash width and ambient bubble radius.

In both plots, the curves for N = 105 and N = 104 particles were derived
by averaging over 10 and 20 simulations respectively in order to keep statis-
tical ﬂuctuations to an acceptable level. The N = 106 simulation required
just a single simulation for robust statistics.

5 Summary and Future Work

Sonoluminescence is well suited to investigation by Molecular Dynamics be-
cause the range of densities and time scales is large, yet the number of par-
ticles involved is relatively small. Because the phenomena still poses experi-
mentally diﬃcult, unsolved questions regarding its mechanism and ultimate
energy focusing energy potential, we feel it is an excellent subject for much
more detailed MD investigations than the initial eﬀort we have presented
here.

In this paper, we introduced a simple model for the interior dynamics of
single noble gas bubble sonoluminescence, as a hard sphere gas driven by a
spherical piston controlled be the Rayleigh-Plesset equation. Energy losses
due to ionization were also accounted for. We considered both constant and

5 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK

variable radius hard sphere models, and these lead to quantitatively similar
results. Fast, tree-based algorithms allowed us to evolve million particle
systems through the entire collapse process. Our calculations indicate that
extreme energy focusing occurs within the bubble which in some cases is
driven by a shock-like compression in the gas. Peak temperatures range
from 40,000 K for He to 500,000 K for Xe. These are accompanied by high
levels of ionization during the ﬁnal collapse, and formation of a transient,
high density plasma state seems quite likely.

The imposition of a thermal boundary condition at the wall of the bubble
leads to greatly increased energy focusing and non-uniformity within a col-
lapsing bubble. In any case, the predicted ﬂash width scales roughly linearly
with the ambient bubble radius.

There are a variety of interesting directions for future research in this
problem. For example, our simulations simply treat the bubble wall as a
piston moving in with a prescribed velocity. A natural improvement would
be to couple the internal molecular dynamics to the wall velocity to ob-
tain a self-consistent bubble motion and internal dynamics. This could be
done by coupling to Euler or Navier Stokes models for the surrounding ﬂuid.
This may be particularly important for accurately computing the dynam-
ics through the point of minimum radius. In our present model there may
be over compression of the gas in some simulations as the minimum radius
is approached, since the prescribed piston motion does not respond to the
rapid increase in the internal gas pressure. Conversely, when the piston re-
tracts after this point, a nonphysical gap often develops between the bubble
boundary and the outer extent of the gas, which may under-compress the
gas.

Another important area for future research is adding in water vapor into
the bubble interior. This provides a potentially important cooling mecha-
nism, which may strongly modulate the light emission and energy focusing,
and may explain the strong ambient temperature dependence of the emitted
light intensity. We have done preliminary investigations of this, and these
show that water evaporation from the bubble surface into the interior must
be included to avoid rapid expulsion of the water vapor. It is also possible
that the water could be directly involved in the light emission, when it is
properly included in the model.

Other bubble collapse geometries could also be considered, and these
may have diﬀerent energy focusing characteristics. For example, one could

5 SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK

30

consider a nonspherical collapse, hemi-spherical bubbles collapsing on a solid
surface, or consider collapse geometries appropriate for bubble jetting scenar-
ios. Similarly, one could see if special collapse proﬁles can be used to reach
much higher internal temperatures, and otherwise explore the extremes of
the energy focusing potential. Perhaps a mode could even be found in which
small amounts of deuterium-deuterium fusion could be induced, assuming
there is deuterium gas in the bubble as well.

Including additional atomic physics such as atomic excitation, rotational
and vibrational degrees of freedom (needed for non-noble gases or water va-
por) and electron-ion recombination would all allow for more accurate energy
accounting, and may also be directly related to light emission mechanisms.
Another major direction would be to include electric ﬁeld eﬀects into the
the simulation. Algorithms for such models must treat long range electro-
static interactions to avoid incurring serious errors. They must also be able
to evaluate long range forces eﬃciently since calculating interactions pairwise
becomes expensive for more than a few thousand particles. For these rea-
sons, multipole methods are particularly attractive— they use a hierarchy of
spatial subdivisions and a multipole expansion to evaluate interactions with
little more than linear eﬀort in the number of particles. See [13, 12] for de-
tails and see also [28] for further references on methods for evaluating long
range forces. This would potentially allow direct simulation of the ions and
electrons produced as well, which, along with including atomic excitation,
would allow direct simulation of the light emitting processes. With these
eﬀects included, an extremely detailed picture of the SL phenomena could
be laid out.

Of course, larger scale, parallel simulations are essential to actually achieve
direct comparisons with present SL experiments. Because the simple hard
sphere interactions are quite local, the system should be amenable to paral-
lelization. We expect that the cost (in collision count) for a hard sphere MD
simulation scales roughly like N 4/3, where N is the number of particles, since
the collapse time from the ambient to the minimum radius scales linearly
with R0 (and so we conjecture that the collision rate also increases roughly
linearly with the R0). Thus simulations using one hundred times as many
particles (i.e. N = 108) would require 500 times as much computer time
assuming near optimality in the algorithm. This is somewhat beyond the
range of a single supercomputer CPU, but would become quite practical on
a 100 node system of workstation-grade CPUs.

Finally, it would be of great interest to investigate where less costly con-
tinuum models and Monte Carlo simulations are appropriate for studying
sonoluminescence and to develop techniques for coupling these methods to
detailed molecular dynamics simulations near the light emitting hot spot, in
order to produce more complete models with greater predictive validity.

There is also a great deal to explore experimentally. One example relevant
to our study is that it would be useful to measure ﬂashwidth as a function of
ambient bubble radius (or, in practice, intensity and frequency of the driving
sound ﬁeld), for comparison with the scaling predictions of MD and other
models.

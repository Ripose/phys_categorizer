A NOTE ON SYMPLECTIC ALGORITHMS

We present the symplectic algorithms in the Lagrangian formalism for the Hamiltonian
systems by virtue of the noncommutative diﬀerential calculus w.r.t. the discrete time and
the Euler- Lagrange cohomological concepts. We also show that the trapezoidal integrator
is symplectic in certain sense.

1. It is well known that the symplectic algorithms [1][2] for the ﬁnite dimensional Hamil-
tonian systems are very powerful and successful in numerical calculations in comparison
with other various non-symplectic computational schemes since the symplectic schemes
preserve the symplectic structure in certain sense. On the other hand, the Lagrangian
formalism is quie useful for the Hanmiltonian systems. since the both are important at
least in the equal fooding. Therefore, it should be not useless to establish the symplectic
algorithms in the Lagrangian formalism. As a matter of fact, the Lagrangian formalism
is more or less earier to generalized to the inﬁnite dimensional systems such as classical
ﬁeld theory.
In this note we present the symplectic geometry and symplectic algorithm in the La-
grangian formalism in addition to the Hamiltonian one for the ﬁnite dimensional Hamilto-
nian systems with the help of the Euler-Lagrange (EL) cohomological concepts introduced
very recently by the authors in [5].
In the course of numerical calculation, the ”time” t

It is well known that the diﬀerences of functions on T w.r.t. T do not obey the Leibniz
law. In order to show that the symplectic structure at diﬀerent moments tk’s is preserved
some well-established diﬀerential calculus should be employed. This implies that some
noncommutative diﬀerential calculus ( NCDC ) on T and the function space on it should
be used even for the well-established sympleclic algorithms. In this note we employ this
simple NCDC [3] [4].
We also show that the trapezoidal integrator is symplectic in certain sense.
Finally, we end with some remarks.
2. In this section, we ﬁrst recall some well-known contents in the Lagrangian formalism
for the ﬁnite dimensional Hamiltonian dystems. We employ the ordinarial calculus to
show that the symplectic structure is preserved by introducing the Euler-Lagrange (EL)
cohomological concepts such as the EL 1-forms, the null EL 1-form, the coboundary EL

It is important to emphasize that the
1-form and the EL condition and so forth [5].
symplectic structure preserving is in the function space in general rather than in the
solution space of the EL equation only. The reason will be explained later.

Lat us introduce the EL 1-form [5]

It is clear that the EL equation is given by the null EL 1-form

E(qi, ˙qj) :=

dqi.

which is a special case of the coboundary EL 1-forms

E(qi, ˙qj) = 0,

E(qi, ˙qj) = dα(qi, ˙qj),

where α(qi, ˙qj) an arbitrary function of (qi, ˙qj) in the function space F (T M).
Taking the exterior derivative d of the Lagrangian, we get

where θ is the canonical 1-form deﬁned by

dL(qi, ˙qj) = E(qi, ˙qj) + d

dt θ,

It is easy to see that iﬀ the EL 1-form is closed w.r.t. d, i.e.

which is called the EL condition [5], and making use of nilpotancy of d, d2L(q, ˙q) = 0,
then it follows that the symplectic conservation law w.r.t. t:

ω = dθ = ∂2L

It is important to note that although the null EL 1-form and the coboundary EL 1-forms
are satisfy the EL condition and they are cohomologically trivial, this does not mean that
the closed EL 1-form are always exact. As a matter of fact, the equation (refdL1) shows
that the EL 1-form is not always exact since the canonical 1-form is not trivial in general.
In addition, it is also important to note that the qi(t)’s, i = 1,
, n in the EL codition
are still in the function space in general rather than in the solution space of the equation

condition in general rather than in the solution space only.
In order to transfer to the Hamiltonian formalism, we introduce the canonical momentum

and take a Legendre transformation to get the Hamiltonian function

Then the EL equation becomes the canonical equations as follows

It is clear that a pair of the EL 1-forms should be introduced now

In terms of zT = (qi,

, qn, p1,

, pn), the canonical equations and the EL 1-form become

Now it is straightforward to show that the symplectic structure preserving law

holds if and only if the (closed) EL condition is satisﬁed

3. Now we consider the simplectic structure-preserving of symplectic algorithms in the
Lagrangian formalism.

4. We now show some well-known symplectic schems in the Lagrangian formalism for the
Hamiltonian systems.
4-1. The Euler mid-point scheme
The well-known Euler mid-point scheme for the sepavabal Hamiltonian systems is as
follows

from which it follows that

q(n+1)

q(n) =

(p(n+1) + p(n)),

p(n+1)

p(n) =

q(n+1) + q(n)

)].

Now it is easy to get the Euler mid-point scheme in the Lagrangian formalism:

In order to show that it is symplectic, we ﬁst introduce the DEL 1-form as follows

E(n)

D = dqT (n)

q(n+1)

Therefore, the Euler mid-point scheme is symplectic.
4-2. The Euler mid-point scheme for generic Hamiltonian
For the general Hamiltonian H, the similar preserved symplectic form can also be given.
Let us start with

q(n+1)

q(n) = hHp(

p(n+1)

p(n) =

p(n+1) + p(n)
2

,

q(n+1) + q(n)
2

)

hHq(

−

p(n+1) + p(n)
2

.

q(n+1) + q(n)
2

).

Introduce a pair of DEL 1-forms

E(n)

D (q) = dqT (n)

−

{

2

.

,

q(n+1) + q(n)

)

}

q(n+1) + q(n)
2

)

.

}

The DEL condition for the pair of the DEL 1-forms now read

dE(n)

D (q) = 0,

dE(n)

D (p) = 0.

From these condition it follows that

4-3. The high order symplectic schemes
Similarly, it can be checked that the high order symplectic schemes preserve also some 2-
forms in dq(k)’s which are in fact the symplectic structures. Let us consider two examples
for this point.
The ﬁrst one is proposed by Feng et al in terms of generating function [6].The scheme is
as follows

The second example is symplectic Runge-Kutta scheme. First, the stage one and order

5. Let us now study the trapezoidal integrator.
It is well known that this scheme is good enough in comparison with other well-known
symplectic schemes. But for the long time, it is not clear why it is so satisfactory.

It is straightforewordly to show that the two form is closed and non-degenerate so that it

Similar to the separable Hamiltonian case, let us introduce a pair of DEL 1-forms

Similarly, by some straightforward but tedious calculation, the DEL condition for the pair
of DEL 1-forms gives rise to the following symplectic 2-form and its preserving property:

where

If we introduce the new variables,

h

˜q(n) = q(n) +

H (n)

it follows that

ω(n)
D == d˜p(n)

d˜q(n)

This is another expression for the preseved symplectic structure in the trapezoidal scheme.
6. Finally, some remarks are in order:
In order to show whether a scheme for a given Hamiltonian system is symplectic
1.
preserving, the ﬁrst issue to be considered is to release the scheme from the solution space
to the function space. Otherwise, it is diﬃcult to make precise sense for the diﬀerential

10

calculation in the solution space since the solutions are more or less restricted. One of
the roles played by the EL cohomological concepts is just to release the schemes from the
solution space to the function space.
2. The EL cohomology and its discrete counterpart introduced in [5] and used here
are not trivial for the ﬁnite dimensional Hamiltonian systems. It has been shown that
the symplectic preserving property is closely linked to the cohomology. Namely, it is
equivalent to the closed condition of the EL 1-forms. Of course, it is needed to further
study the content and the meaning for the EL cohomology.
3. It should be mentioned that all issues studied in this note can be generalized to the
case of diﬀerence discrete phase space for the separable Hamiltonian systems [3] [4].

Acknowledgments The author would like to thanck Professor M.Z. Qin for informing us
after our relevant work has been ﬁnished that the symplectic preserving property for the
trapezoidal scheme had been given by Wang [7] a few years ago.

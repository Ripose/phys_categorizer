We give a stochastic microscopic modelling of stock markets driven by continuous double auction.
If we take into account the mimetic behavior of traders, when they place limit order, our virtual
markets shows the power-law tail of the distribution of returns with the exponent outside the Levy
stable region, the short memory of returns and the long memory of volatilities. The Hurst exponent
of our model is asymptotically 1/2. An explanation is also given for the proﬁle of the autocorrelation
function, which is responsible for the value of the Hurst exponent.

INTRODUCTION

In ﬁnancial markets, it seems very natural to believe
that large price changes are caused by large transac-
tion volumes[1]. Farmer et al. has, however, proposed
an entirely diﬀerent story of large price changes in the
markets driven by continuous double auctions[2]. They
has argued that large returns are not caused by large
orders, while the large gaps between the occupied price
levels in the orderbook lead to large price changes in each
transaction, and actually showed that the gap distribu-
tion closely matches the return distribution, based on
the analysis of the orderbook as well as the transaction
records on the London Stock Exchange. They have also
showed that the virtual market orders of a constant size
reproduces the actual distribution of returns.

Then, we arrive at the next question, that is, what re-
ally causes large gaps. Maslov has introduced and stud-
ied a simple model of markets driven by continuous dou-
ble auctions[3].
In his model, traders choose one from
the two types of orders at random. One is a market or-
der which is a order to sell or buy a ﬁxed amount of shares
immediately at the best available price on the market on
the time. The other is a limit order which is a order to
buy or sell a ﬁxed amount of shares with the speciﬁcation
of the limit price (the worst allowable price). The rela-
tive price of a new limit order to the most recent market
price is a stochastic variable drawn from a uniform distri-
bution in a given interval. Numerical simulations of the
model show that it has such realistic features to a certain
extent as the power-law tail of the distribution of returns,
and the long range correlation of the volatility. However
the price evolution has some essentially diﬀerent statis-
tical properties from the actual one. First the exponent
α of the power-law tail of the distribution of returns is
inside the Levy stable region ( 0 < α
2 ), while the
actual value is close to 3[4, 5]. Second the Hurst expo-
nent H = 1/4 is unrealistic. In actual market, we have H
= 1/2 for long-term, which is the value for free diﬀusion.

Challet and Stinchcombe have proposed a model with
non-constant occurrence rates of various types of orders
as a model in the same class as Maslov’s[6]. The price
of their model is over diﬀusive (H > 1/2) for short-term
and diﬀusive (H=1/2) for long-term.

In this paper, we propose a stochastic model with a
novel feature in the same class as the above models. We
take into account the mimetic behavior of traders, when
they place limit order, then our virtual markets shows
the behaviors which are widely recognized as the stylized
facts in ﬁnancial markets, that is, the power-law tail of
the distribution of returns with the exponent outside the
Levy stable region[4, 5], the short memory of returns and
the long memory of volatilities[7]. The Hurst exponent
of our model is asymptotically 1/2. An explanation is
also given for the proﬁle of the autocorrelation function,
which is responsible for the value of the Hurst exponent.

II. MODEL

We give the deﬁnition of our model here. We intro-
duce the cancellation of orders to maintain the number
of orders stored in orderbook as in the model of Smith et
al[8]. and in other models[6]. We have, therefore, three
types of orders in total on both sides of trade, namely
sell/buy market order, sell/buy limit order and the can-
cellation of sell/buy limit order. The conservation law
indicates αi
δi = 0 for i = sell or buy, where the
parameters αi, µi and δi denote the occurrence rate of
limit order, market order and cancellation respectively.
For simplicity, we also assume that traders always place
a ﬁxed size of order.

The prices at which new limit orders are placed re-
ﬂect traders’ strategies. In Maslov’s paper[3], they are
determined by oﬀsetting the most recent market price by
a random amount drawn from a uniform distribution in
a given interval. Challet and Stinchcombe assume the
Gaussian distribution from which random variables for
the relative prices of sell/buy limit order to ask/bit are
drawn, and put the exclusion hypothesis that if there is
already a order at the price, the price is not available[6].
In the model of Smith et al.[8], traders place the sell(buy)

limit order at any price in the semi-inﬁnite range above
bit (below ask) with uniform probability.

In this paper, we take a little bit more strategic or-
der placement than previous works. We assume the
mimetic behavior of traders, when they place limit or-
ders. Traders in our model sometimes (or a part of
traders always) leave the decision of the limit price to the
others. They believe the majority, and should be so pa-
tient that they can wait in line the execution of their or-
ders for long time. The assumption is implemented here
as follows: With probability p, a limit price of sell(buy)
order is chosen with the probability proportional to the
size of orders stored on the price, and with probability
1-p, a price is randomly chosen between [bit+1, ask+1]
([bit-1, ask-1]) with uniform probability. p will be cru-
cial parameter of the model. The manner when choosing
the limit price in our model is the same as the pref-
erential attachment in the growth model of scale free
networks[9, 10]. ”Rich gets richer” is a concept common
to both models. However, our model is not a growth
model, but the total amount of limit orders loosely ﬁxed,
because the number of coming limit orders are balanced
with market orders and cancellations. Instead, the result
of simulations will show that the distribution of the ﬂuc-
tuation of the gaps between occupied price levels has a
power-law tail owing to the unequal attractive powers of
each of the prices.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF THE
MODEL

The models of continuous double auctions such as
Maslov’s and ours have a diﬃculty to solve analytically
due to the existence of free boundaries: Sell (buy) limit
prices acceptable for traders who place the orders are
bounded on the best price of the opposite side, namely
the bit (ask) price on the time. Slanina[11] and Smith
et al.[8] have formulated a mean ﬁeld approximation of
the master equations to have good results. We adopt,
however, a numerical method, and leave the analytical
examination for the coming papers.

We generate the each types of orders in the ratio of
αi = 0.25(limit order), µi = 0.125(market order) and
δi = 0.125(cancellation) for i = sell or buy. For the sev-
eral values of p, we perform 1,000 times runs of 10,000
step iterations with diﬀerent initial conditions. We place
a unit of shares at each price 1, 2, -1, -2 as the ask, the sec-
ond best sell limit price, the bit and the second best buy
limit price respectively, and also 198 units of sell (buy)
limit orders at random in the range between 1 (-1) and
the random integer drawn from a uniform distribution in
the interval [2,201]([-201,-2]) as a initial condition.

Here we present the several results of the numerical
simulations. FIG. 1 shows the cumulative distribution
functions of price shifts, the gaps between ask and the
second best sell limit price and spreads. Price shifts and
the gaps are sampled after every buy market orders. The

2

results for sell market order are omitted here in order to
avoid a redundancy, because we take the symmetric val-
ues of the parameters and the initial conditions. Spreads
are sampled after every sell and buy market orders. All
the three distributions become broader when the param-
eter p becomes larger. The power law tails appear in all
the graphs for p=0.45, 0.475 and 0.5. The power law ex-
ponents of the tails are near 3 for p=0.475. We use the
Hill estimator of the largest √n data, where n is the size
of sample. The distributions for the parameter p beyond
0.5 are very broad, but steep falls are observed in the
tail.

We see from FIG. 2 that the relative limit price, namely
the distance at which new limit orders are placed away
from the current best price, is broadly distributed when
p becomes large. We want to demonstrate, however, that
the broadness itself of the distribution of the relative limit
price does not create the fat tail of the price shift distri-
bution. First of all, for the purpose, we collect the data
of the limit order by a numerical simulation of the model.
Then we shuﬄe the order of arrivals of limit orders, and
perform a simulation using the surrogate data instead
of the limit price generated by the original rule of our
model. The comparison of the resultant probability dis-
tribution of price shift of the surrogate data with that
of the original data is shown in FIG. 3. The tail of the
distribution does not show a power law behavior, though
the original data does. This experiment reveals that the
information of orderbook plays a essential role in the de-
cision of the price at which new orders are placed in our
model. A similar role of the orderbook will be expected
even in real markets, though the style of the reference
to the orderbook is possibly diﬀerent from that assumed
here.

IV. AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTIONS OF
THE MODEL

We derive the autocorrelation functions of price shift
and of the absolute value of the price shift obtained by
the numerical simulations of the model. The results are
given in the panels of FIG. 4. including comparison with
the autocorrelation functions of the surrogate data men-
tioned in the previous section. In those panels, the unit
of time increment corresponds to a buy market order.

The autocorrelation function of price shift almost van-
ish except the value of time lag τ = 1 for both data.
The values of time lag τ = 1 are -0.41 and -0.46 re-
spectively. Those values are close to -0.5, and are ex-
plainable by the mean ﬁeld approximation of the auto-
correlation function as follows: Let δ1 and δ2 denote the
mean square root of price shift normalized by the stan-
dard deviation. δ1 is the value for the price shift across
the spread, corresponding to the case that the side of the
trade changes from bit to ask or from ask to bit. δ2 cor-
responds to the case that the side of the trade remains
the same. If we assume that the four cases occurs with

2 −

the same probability 1/4 , and it is approximately true in
real markets, the mean ﬁeld approximation of autocor-
relation functions gives the equation ρi =< dptdpt+i >
/σ2 = 1/4(δ2
δ2
1)δ1i. From the normalization condition
δ2
1 + δ2
2 = 2 and the inequality δ1 >> δ2 (because spread
always exists, while the trade successively occurred on
the same side do not necessarily move the price), we have
the result ρi
0.5δ1i. The proﬁle of the autocorrela-
tion function is responsible for the value of the Hurst
p0)/σ2 =
exponent H through the equation V ar(pt
−
t2H . In such
V ar(P

case of short memory as our model, we have the equation
t2H for t >> 1. In our case,
V ar(pt
t
the diﬀusion constant D = 1 + 2 P
i=1 ρi is quite small
owing to the equation ρi
0.5δ1i, and H=1/2 for large
t. An empirical study of the price diﬀusion is presented
in FIG. 5.

We see from the panel (b) of FIG. 4 that the auto-
correlation functions of the absolute value of price shift
(empirical volatility) have long memory. Both data plot-
ted there are well ﬁtted by power laws. The original data,
however, holds the memory of volatility stronger than the

surrogate data does.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Taking the strategy leaving the decision of the limit
price to the others in the stochastic model of ﬁnancial
markets driven by continuous double auction, the vir-
tual markets shows the power-law tail of the distribu-
tion of returns with the exponent near 3 according to
the parameter which determines the ratio of the mimetic
limit order. The short memory of returns and the long
memory of volatilities are also reproduced by the model.
The Hurst exponent H of our model is asymptotically
1/2. The mean ﬁeld approximation explains the pro-
ﬁle of the autocorrelation function, which is responsible
for the value of the Hurst exponent H. The strategy as-
sumed here are eﬀective in holding the memory of market
volatility strong.

Abstract

The dynamic critical behavior of the two-replica cluster algorithm is studied. Several versions

of the algorithm are applied to the two-dimensional, square lattice Ising model with a staggered

ﬁeld. The dynamic exponent for the full algorithm is found to be less than 0.4. It is found that

odd translations of one replica with respect to the other together with global ﬂips are essential for

obtaining a small value of the dynamic exponent.

INTRODUCTION

The Swendsen-Wang (SW) algorithm and related cluster methods1,2,3,4,5,6,7 have greatly

improved the eﬃciency of simulating the critical region of a variety of spin models. The

original SW algorithm can be modiﬁed to work for spin systems with internal symmetry

breaking ﬁelds8. Spin models of this kind include the Ising antiferromagnet in a uniform

ﬁeld, the random ﬁeld Ising model and lattice gas models of adsorption in porous media9.

The modiﬁcation proposed in Ref. 8 is to assign Boltzmann weights depending on the net

ﬁeld acting on the cluster to decide whether the cluster should be ﬂipped. Unfortunately, the

modiﬁed SW algorithm is not eﬃcient. The problem is that large clusters of spins usually

have a large net ﬁeld acting on them and are prevented from ﬂipping by these ﬁelds. An

algorithm for Ising systems with ﬁelds that avoids this problem was introduced by Redner,

Machta, and Chayes10,11. In this two-replica cluster algorithm large clusters are constructed

from two replicas of the same system and have no net ﬁeld acting on them so that they

may be freely ﬂipped. The two-replica cluster algorithm has been applied to study the

phase transition of benzene adsorbed in zeolites9 and is more eﬃcient than the conventional

Metropolis algorithm for locating and simulating the critical point and the phase coexistence

line. Combined with the replica exchange method of Swendsen and Wang12, the two-replica

method has been applied to the random ﬁeld Ising model13. The two-replica method is

closely related to the geometric cluster Monte Carlo method14,15,16.

In this paper, we report on a detailed investigation of the dynamics of the two-replica

cluster (TRC) algorithm as applied to the two-dimensional Ising ferromagnetic in a stag-

gered ﬁeld (equivalently, the Ising antiferromagnet in a uniform ﬁeld). The TRC algorithm

introduced in Ref. 10 has two components that are not required for detailed balance and er-

godicity. We studied the contribution to the performance of the algorithm of these optional

components. We ﬁnd that the complete TRC algorithm has a very small dynamic expo-

nent z < 0.4. However, we also ﬁnd that this small value of z requires one of the optional

components and that this component depends on a special symmetry of Ising model in a

staggered ﬁeld. This observation leads to the question of whether cluster methods exist for

eﬃciently simulating more general Ising models with ﬁelds. We investigated other optional

components for the algorithm but these do not lead to acceleration when ﬁelds are present.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce the Ising model in a staggered

2

ﬁeld and describe the TRC algorithm. In Sec. III we deﬁne the quantities to be measured

and how errors are computed. In Sec. IV we present the results. The paper closes in Sec. V

with a discussion.

II. THE MODEL AND TWO-REPLICA ALGORITHM

A.

Ising Model in a Staggered Field

The Hamiltonian for the Ising model in a staggered ﬁeld is

βH[σ] = −K X
<i,j>

σiσj − X
i

Hiσi

(1)

where the spin variables, σi take the values ±1. K is the coupling strength and Hi is the

magnetic ﬁeld at site i. The summation in the ﬁrst term of Eq. (1) is over nearest neighbors

on an L × L square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and L even. The second

summation is over the sites of the lattice. The staggered ﬁeld is obtained by setting Hi = H

if i is in the even sublattice and Hi = −H if i is in the odd sublattice. The staggered

ﬁeld breaks the up-down symmetry(σi ← −σi) of the zero ﬁeld Ising model, however two

symmetries remain. The Hamiltonian is invariant under even translations:

σi+r0 ← σi for all i

(2)

with r0 any vector in the even sublattice. The Hamiltonian is also invariant under odd

translations together with a global ﬂip:

σi+r1 ← −σi for all i

(3)

with r1 any vector in the odd sublattice.

Figure 1 shows the line of critical points, Kc(H) for this model. We carried out simulations

at three points on the critical line taken from the high precision results of Ref. 17,

Kc(0) = 0.4406867952

Kc(2) = 0.7039642053

Kc(4) = 1.1717153065

3

The basic idea of the two-replica cluster algorithm is to simultaneously simulate two

independent Ising systems, σ and τ , on the same lattice and in the same ﬁeld. Clusters of

pairs of spins in this two-replica system are identiﬁed and ﬂipped. In order to construct

clusters, auxilliary bond variables are introduced. The bond variables {ηij} are deﬁned for

each bond < i, j > and take values 0 and 1. We say that < i, j > is occupied if ηij = 1. A

bond < i, j > is satisﬁed if σi = σj and τi = τj. Only satisﬁed bonds may be occupied.

The two-replica algorithm simulates a joint distribution of the Edwards-Sokal18 type for

{σi} and {τi}, and {ηij}. The statistical weight X[σ, τ, η] for the joint distribution is

X[σ, τ, η] = e−G[σ,τ ]∆[σ, τ, η]Bp[η]

where

G = K X
<i,j>

σiτiσjτj − X
i

Hi(σi + τi),

B is the standard Bernoulli factor,

Bp[η] = p|η|(1 − p)Nb−|η|

(4)

(5)

(6)

|η| = # {< i, j > |ηij = 1} is the number of occupied bonds and Nb is the total number of

bonds of the lattice. The ∆ factor enforces the rule that only satisﬁed bonds are occupied:

if for every bond < i, j > such that ηij = 1 the spins agree in both replicas (σij = σij

and τi = τj) then ∆[σ, τ, η] = 1; otherwise ∆[σ, τ, η] = 0.

It is straightforward to show

that integrating X[σ, τ, η] over the bond variables, η yields the statistical weight for two

independent Ising model in the same ﬁeld,

e−βH[σ]−βH[τ ] = const X
{η}

X[σ, τ, η]

(7)

if the identiﬁcation is made that p = 1 − e−4K.

B. Two-Replica Cluster Algorithms

The idea of the two-replica cluster algorithm is to carry out moves on the spin and bond

variables that satisfy detailed balance and are ergodic with respect to the joint distribution

of Eq. (4). The occupied bonds η deﬁne connected clusters of sites. We call site i an active

site if σi 6= τi and clusters are composed either entirely of active or inactive sites. If a cluster

of active sites is ﬂipped so that σ ← −σ and τ ← −τ the factor G is unchanged.

4

A single Monte Carlo sweep of the TRC algorithm is composed of the following three

steps:

1. Occupy satisﬁed bond connecting active sites with probability p = 1 − e−4K. Identify

clusters of active sites connected by occupied bond (including single active sites). For

each cluster k, randomly and independently assign a spin value sk = ±1. If site i is in

cluster k then the new spin values are σi ← sk and τi ← −sk. In this way all active

sites are updated.

2. Update each replica separately with one sweep of the Metropolis algorithm.

3. Translate the τ replica by a random amount relative to the σ replica. If the translation

is by an odd vector, all τ spins are ﬂipped.

Step 1 of the TRC is similar to a sweep of the SW algorithm except that clusters are

grown in a two-replica system rather than in a single replica and only active clusters are

ﬂipped. Note also that the bond occupation probability is p = 1 − e−4K for the TRC

algorithm and p = 1 − e−2K for the SW algorithm. It is straightforward to show that Step

1 of the TRC algorithm satisﬁes detailed balance with respect to the joint distribution Eq.

(4). Since only active sites participate in Step 1 of the algorithm, the Metropolis sweep,

Step 2, is required for ergodicity. Step 3 contains the optional components of the algorithm:

an even translation or an odd translation plus ﬂip of one replica relative to the other. These

moves are justiﬁed by the symmetries of the Ising model in a staggered ﬁeld stated in Eqs.

(2) and (3). When we refer to the TRC algorithm without further speciﬁcation, we mean

the algorithm described by the Steps 1-3 above. In the foregoing we also study the TRC

with only even translations or with only odd translations.

In the TRC algorithm we ﬂip only active clusters but it is also possible to ﬂip inactive

clusters if a weight factor associated with the change in G is used. We call a ﬂip of an active

cluster to an active cluster (+− to −+ or −+ to +−) an active ﬂip. The TRC algorithm

with inactive ﬂips is obtained by replacing Step 1 with the following:

1′. Occupy satisﬁed bonds with probability p = 1 − e−4K.

Identify clusters connected

by occupied bonds (including single sites). For each cluster k, taken one at a time,

randomly propose two new spin values values, sk = ±1 and tk = ±1 for the σ and τ

5

spins respectively. Compute δG, the change in G that would occur if the spins in the

kth cluster are changed to the proposed values leaving spins in other clusters ﬁxed. If

δG ≤ 0 accept the proposed spin values (set σi ← sk and τi ← tk for all sites i in

cluster k), otherwise, if δG > 0 accept the proposed spin values with probability e−δG.

Step 1′ is by itself ergodic however it may be useful to add Metropolis sweeps and trans-

lations.

III. METHODS

We measured three observables using the TRC algorithm: the absolute value of the

magnetization of a single replica, m; the energy of a single replica, E; and the absolute value

of the net staggered magnetization for both replicas, s, where the deﬁnition of s is

s = |( X
i∈odd

− X
i∈even

)(σi + τi)|.

(8)

Note that the staggered magnetization is conserved by all components of the TRC algo-

rithm except Metropolis sweeps and inactive ﬂips. For each of these observables we com-

puted expectation values of the integrated autocorrelation time, τint and the exponential

autocorrelation time, τexp. From τint, we estimated the dynamic exponent z.

The autocorrelation function for φ, Γφφ(t) is given by,

Γφφ(t) = lim
l→∞

Pl−t

t′=1(φ(t′) − ˆφ)(φ(t′ + t) − ˆφ)

Pl

t′=1(φ(t′) − ˆφ)2

.

The integrated autocorrelation time for observable φ is deﬁned by

τ =

and the exponential autocorrelation time for an observable φ is deﬁned by19

τexp,φ = lim

.

(10)

(11)

In practice the limits in Eqs. (9), (10) and (11) must be evaluated at ﬁnite values. The

length of the Monte Carlo runs determine l and are discussed below. Following Ref. 19, we

deﬁne

τint,φ =

(12)

and choose the cutoﬀ t∗ to be the smallest integer such that t∗ ≥ κτint,φ, where κ = 6. We

used the least-squares method to ﬁt log Γφφ(t/τint,φ) as a function of t to obtain the ratio of

τint,φ/τexp,φ and chose a cut-oﬀ at t/τint,φ = 5.

We used the blocking method7,19 to estimate errors. The whole sample of n MC mea-

surements was divided into m blocks of equal length l = n/m. For each block i and each
measured quantity A, we computed the mean ˆAi . Our estimates of ˆA and its error δA are

obtained from:

ˆA =

(13)

(14)

In our simulations, we divided the whole sample into m blocks where m is between 10 and

30.

For the data collected using the TRC algorithm, each block has a length l ≥ 103τint.

For the data collected using modiﬁcations of the TRC algorithm, each block has a length

l ≥ 102τint. Data were collected for H = 0, 2 and 4 and for size L in the range 16 to 256.

IV. RESULTS

A.

Integrated Autocorrelation Time

Table I gives the integrated autocorrelation time using the TRC algorithm for the mag-

netization, energy and staggered magnetization. Table I is comparable to the Table in Ref.

10 but the present numbers are systematically larger, especially at the larger system sizes.

This discrepancy may be due to the sliding cut-oﬀ t∗ used here instead of a ﬁxed cut-oﬀ at

200 employed in Ref. 10.

Table II gives the integrated autocorrelation times for magnetization using the TRC

with only even or only odd translations. The comparison of TRC algorithm with only even

translations and with only odd translations in Tables II shows that odd translations together

with global ﬂips of one replica relative to another are essential to achieve small and slowly

growing autocorrelation times when the staggered ﬁeld is present.

Table III shows the magnetization autocorrelation times using diﬀerent algorithms for

system size L = 80. The Swendsen-Wang (SW) algorithm has the smallest τint,m in the

7

absence of ﬁelds. However, when ﬁelds are present and the SW algorithm is then modiﬁed

according to the method of Ref. 8 the performance is worse even than that of the Metropolis

algorithm. The slow equilibration of the SW algorithm in the presence of the staggered ﬁeld

is due to small acceptance probabilities for ﬂipping large clusters. On the other hand, the

presence of staggered ﬁelds does not signiﬁcantly change the performance the two-replica

algorithm so long as odd translations are present. Inactive ﬂips are helpful when there is

no staggered ﬁeld but when the staggered ﬁeld is turned on, the autocorrelation time is not

substantially improved by inactive ﬂips. The explanation for the ineﬀectiveness of inactive

ﬂips when the staggered ﬁeld is present is that the probability of accepting an inactive ﬂip

is small. For example, this probability is 1.4% for L = 80 and H = 4.

The CPU time per spin on a Pentium III 450 MHz machine was also measured for the

various algorithms and is listed in Table III for L = 80 . By considering a range of system

sizes we found that the CPU time for one MC sweep of the TRC algorithm increases nearly

linearly with the number of spins. The TRC algorithm is a factor of 3 slower than the

Metropolis algorithm but this diﬀerence is more than compensated for by system size 80

by the much faster equilibration of the TRC algorithm. Even without odd translations, the

TRC algorithm outperforms Metropolis for size 80.

B. Exponential Autocorrelation Time

The ratio of the integrated to exponential autocorrelation times was found to be nearly

independent of system size over the range L = 16 to L = 256. We found that over this size

range τint,m/τexp,m varied from 0.448 ± 0.008 to 0.425 ± 0.008 for H = 0; from 0.44 ± 0.01

to 0.43 ± 0.01 for H = 2; and from 0.448 ± 0.009 to 0.409 ± 0.009 for H = 4. The ratio

τint,s/τexp,s is also nearly independent of L and H and is about 0.45. The ratio τint,E /τexp,E is

nearly independent of L but decreases slowly with H ranging from 0.29 to 0.25 as H ranges

from 0 to 4. The almost constant τint,φ/τexp,φ for diﬀerent sizes suggests that the integrated

and exponential autocorrelation times are governed by the same dynamic critical exponent.

8

C. Dynamic Exponent

Figures 2 and 3 show the magnetization integrated autocorrelation time for the TRC

plotted on log-log and log-linear scales, respectively. Figures 4 and 5 show the energy inte-

grated autocorrelation time for the TRC plotted on log-log and log-linear scales, respectively.

Figures 6 and 7 show the staggered magnetization integrated autocorrelation time for the

TRC plotted on log-log and log-linear scales, respectively.

For the whole range of L, logarithmic growth appears to give a somewhat better ﬁt than

a simple power law, particularly for the magnetization. Therefore, our results are consistent

with z = 0 for the TRC algorithm. Under the assumption that the dynamic exponent is not

zero, we also carried out weighted least-squares ﬁts to the form ALz and varied Lmin, the

minimum system size included in the ﬁt. Figures 8, 9 and 10 show the dynamic exponent

z for the magnetization, energy and staggered magnetization, respectively, as a function

of Lmin using the TRC algorithm. Figures 11 and 12, show the dynamic exponent as a

function of Lmin for the magnetization for the TRC with only even translations and only

odd translations, respectively.

In all cases except zint,m,even, the dynamic exponent is a

decreasing function of Lmin. For the magnetization, zint,m appears to extrapolate to a value

between 0.1 and 0.2 as Lmin → ∞ while for the energy and staggered magnetization, the

dynamic exponent appears to extrapolate to a value between 0.3 and 0.4. The small value of

the dynamic exponent requires that odd translations and ﬂips are included in the algorithm.

From Fig. 11 it is clear that the dynamic exponent is near 2 for the TRC algorithm with

only even translations.

Table IV gives results of the weighted least squares ﬁts for z for the smallest values of Lmin

for which there is a reasonable conﬁdence level. Since there is a general downward curvature

in the log-log graphs, these numbers are likely to be overestimates of the asymptotic values.

Thus, we can conclude that the asymptotic dynamic exponent for the TRC algorithm is

likely to be less than 0.4 and is perhaps exactly zero. The dynamic exponent is apparently

independent of the strength of the staggered ﬁeld. For the case of the SW algorithm applied

to the two-dimensional Ising with no staggered ﬁeld the best estimate is z = 0.25 ± 0.0120,21

but the results are also consistent with logarithmic growth of relaxation times. The numbers

for dynamic exponent for the SW appear to be smaller than for the TRC algorithm but this

diﬀerence may simply reﬂect larger corrections to scaling in the case of the TRC .

9

V. DISCUSSION

We studied the dynamics of the two-replica cluster algorithm applied to the two-

dimensional Ising model in a staggered ﬁeld. We found that the dynamic exponent of

the algorithm is either very small (z ≤ 0.4) or zero ( τ ∼ log L) and that the dynamic

exponent does not depend on the strength of the staggered ﬁeld. A precise value of z could

not be determined because of large corrections to scaling. We tested the importance of

various optional components of the algorithm and found that an odd translation and global

ﬂip of one replica relative to another is essential for achieving rapid equilibration. Without

this component, z is near 2 so there is no qualitative improvement over the Metropolis al-

gorithm. An odd translation and global ﬂip of one replica relative to the other allows for a

large change of the total magnetization of the system with an acceptance fraction of 100%.

Large changes in the global magnetization may also occur in the Swendsen-Wang algorithm

in a ﬁeld or via inactive ﬂips in the TRC algorithm but these ﬂips have a small acceptance

fraction due to the staggered ﬁeld. Unfortunately, the odd translation and ﬂip move is

allowed because of a special symmetry of the Ising model in a staggered ﬁeld. For more

general Ising systems with translationally invariant ﬁelds, we expect performance similar to

the TRC with even translations only. In this case, the autocorrelation time is signiﬁcantly

less than for the Metropolis algorithm but the dynamic exponent is about the same. While

the two-replica approach is useful for these more general problems of Ising systems with

ﬁelds, it does not constitute a method that overcomes critical slowing down except when

additional symmetries are present that allow one replica to be ﬂipped relative to the other.

Development of general methods for eﬃciently simulating critical spin systems with ﬁelds

remains an open problem.

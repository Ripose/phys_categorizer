Abstract

method.

A numerical method is developed for calculating the
real time Green’s functions of very large sparse Hamil-
tonian matrices, which exploits the numerical solu-
tion of the inhomogeneous time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation. The method has a clear-cut structure reﬂect-
ing the most naive deﬁnition of the Green’s functions,
and is very suitable to parallel and vector supercom-
puters. The eﬀectiveness of the method is illustrated
by applying it to simple lattice models.

Introduction

In many ﬁelds of quantum physics, evaluation of
the Green’s functions constitutes the most important
and diﬃcult part of the theoretical treatment1). For
example, to compute physical quantities of manybody
systems in condensed matter physics, one should often
calculate the Green’s function of Hamiltonian matrices
having a degree N of 106 or more. Therefore eﬃcient
numerical algorithms, such as recursive Green’s func-
tion methods, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and the
Lanczos methods have been developed and applied to
various problems.

Recursive Green’s function methods2) have succeeded

in evaluating dynamic quantities of relatively small
systems by calculating directly the real-time Green’s
function. For example, the conductance of quantum
dots in chaotic, and regular regimes has been inten-
sively investigated with these methods3). However,
this scheme is prohibitive for huge Hamiltonian matri-
ces because it requires computational time increasing
rapidly as a function of the matrix size.

Quantum Monte Carlo methods4,5), which gener-
ate the imaginary-time Green’s functions, have been
successfully used for evaluating thermodynamic quan-
tities of relatively large systems. For evaluating dy-
namic quantities such as conductivity, however, one
has to rely on numerical analytic continuation (e.g.,
maximum entropy method6)) from the imaginary-time
Green’s functions to the real-time ones. This proce-
dure is, however, not unambiguous due to two reasons:
one is the statistical errors originating from Monte
Carlo sampling, which are ampliﬁed by numerical an-
alytical continuation, and the other is the bias intro-
duced by the default model in the maximum entropy

† Condensed from the article submitted to Phys. Rev. E.

The Lanczos methods7,8) have been one of few re-
liable techniques for evaluating dynamical responses of
moderate-size Hamiltonian matrices.The Lanczos meth-
ods use a linear transformation to a new basis in which
the Hamiltonian matrix has a tridiagonal form, and
lead to a continued fraction representation of the di-
agonal matrix elements of the Green’s function. The
drawback of these methods is the numerical instability
which may lead to spurious eigenstates9). Recently,
the Lanczos method has been extended to the ﬁnite
temperature case by introducing random sampling over
the ground and excited states10).

In this paper, we present a new algorithm called
Particle Source Method (PSM), which is based on the
most naive and eﬀective deﬁnition of the real-time Green’s
functions12). Namely, we calculate numerically the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation having a source
term, and see how the wave function responds to the
particle source.

This method has resemblances to the Forced Os-
cillator Method (FOM), which has been developed by
Williams and Maris11), and applied to various classical
and quantum problems13,14). The FOM calculates the
classical equations of motion of the coupled harmonic
oscillators driven by a periodic external force, where
the matrix elements of the Hermitian matrix give the
frequency and the coupling of the ﬁctitious oscillators.
Our method is, however, much more clear-cut than
their method, when applied to quantum systems, since
we calculate the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
itself instead of the classical equations of motion mapped
from the quantum Hamiltonian matrix. The diﬀer-
ence between the two methods is analogous to the dif-
ference between the old quantum theories describing
electronic states of an atom as an ensemble of ﬁcti-
tious harmonic oscillators and the modern quantum
mechanics describing them by bra’s and ket’s.

Preceding to the present article, several authors
have already solved the homogeneous and inhomoge-
neous time-dependent Schr¨odinger equations numeri-
cally 15,16,17,18,19). Most of them are, however, inter-
ested in launching wave packets in the computer and
watching them move around. Several of them tried to
extract time-independent quantities from the motion
of the wave packets18,19). Unfortunately, their inter-
est was limited in obtaining several eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian, but not the Green’s

functions. As the result, they could obtain only the
exact peak position of the spectrum function (i.e., the
imaginary part of the diagonal elements of the Green’s
function), but could not calculate the correct shape
of the spectrum function, the real part, and the oﬀ-
diagonal elements. This is in contrast to our method,
which can calculate both real and imaginary parts, and
both diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal elements of the Green’s
function without calculating the eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors.

In section 2., we present the basic ideas of the PSM.
In section 3., we extend the PSM to the ﬁnite temper-
ature case. In Section 4., we present numerical exam-
ples to illustrate the eﬀectiveness of the methods. A
summary is given in section 5..

where the wave function

j
|
nian H is an N
N Hermitian matrix, ω is the fre-
quency of the source, and η is a small positive imagi-
nary part of the frequency, which determines the reso-
lution of frequency. Note that this source term grows
up exponentially as a function of time due to this small
positive number, which simulates adiabatic switching
on of the particle source. This adiabatic switching on,
which has been absent in the preceding works11,13,19),
is essential to calculate the exact shape of the Green’s
function as a function of energy.

2.3. Analysis of the Numerical Method
2.3.1. Solving the Schr¨odinger Equation

To solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
(1) numerically, we discretize it by using the leap frog
method15,16,17),

where ∆t is the time step. The time step is set as

(20)

(21)

∆t = α/Emax

where Emax is the absolute value of the extreme eigen-
value. We usually use the parameter α between 10−1
and 10−2.

Another method for the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation is the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of the
time-evolution operator. Though the Suzuki-Trotter
decomposition can be applied eﬀectively only to a spe-
cial class of Hamiltonian, it might have the advan-
tage of the leap frog method. First it allows larger
time step. Second it can be used with non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian, such as the Hamiltonian with absorbing
boundary condition.

2.3.2. CPU time

estimated by the number Nprod of matrix-vector prod-
ucts in (20), which is equal to the integration time t
devided by time step ∆t,

i

Therefore the relative error δ becomes exponentially
small as a function of computational eﬀort Nprod. On
the other hand, the resolution η is inversely propor-
tional to Nprod, that is, we need longer CPU time for
higher resolution.

Introducing (19) into (22), we obtain the number
of matrix-vector products for the multiple frequency
calculation

N prod

(24)

Therefore the relative error δ is inversely proportional
to Nprod, which means slower convergence than the sin-
gle frequency calculation. The distance between the
frequencies to be measured, ∆ω, is inversely propor-
tional to Nprod, that is, we need longer CPU time as
we increase the number of the frequencies. Actually,
the integration time for the multiple frequency calcu-
lation should be the longer than t1 and t2. However,
because t1 < t2 is usually satisﬁed, t2 determines the
CPU time for the multiple frequency calculation. Since
the computational eﬀort for a product of sparse ma-
trix and vector is proportional to the matrix size N ,
the total computational time is estimated as

2.3.5. Remote Eigenvalue Problem

The remote eigenvalue problem pointed out in ref-
erence 19) does not appear in our methods, since we
use very small time step in order to integrate the Schr¨odinger
equation stably by using the leap frog method.

2.4. Application to Manybody Problems
2.4.1. Single-particle Green’s function

We can apply our methods for calculating the Green’s

functions of an N-particle system at the ground state.
As an example, let us see how we can calculate the re-
tarded single-particle Green’s function of an N electron
system on a ﬁnite lattice,

G
First, we calculate the ground state

N of the

N-electron system by using one of existing methods
such as the Lanczos method, the quantum Mote Carlo
method, or the ﬁnite diﬀerence method21). The ad-
vantage of using the ﬁnite diﬀerence method is that it
can recycle most of the subroutine resource written for
calculating the Green’s function since both programs
solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in the
same way.

3. Monte Carlo Particle Source Method

turns out that, for suﬃciently large systems, only a sin-
gle conﬁguration of random variables suﬃces to eval-
uate the desired expectation value at ﬁnite tempera-
tures.

3.1. Monte Carlo Calculation of Trace

Computing trace of a large matrix A requires evalu-
ation of N diagonal elements of the matrix. Therefore
it would take formidable computational time if we try
to use PSM for calculating the trace of the product of
operators including the Green’s functions. A Monte
Carlo method to estimate trace of large matrices11)
makes it possible to evaluate the trace of this kind.

Let us introduce a set of random variables φn, (n =

1,

, N ) that satisfy the relation

implies statistical average. Then we de-

The second term in (33) gives the statistical error when
the average is evaluated by the Monte Carlo method.
Assuming all non-zero matrix elements have the value
of oder of 1, the ﬁrst term in (33) becomes oder of
N , while the ﬂuctuation of the second term becomes
oder of √N for sparse matrices since the number of
non-zero matrix elements is oder of N for sparse ma-
trices. Therefore, the statistical error of the trace will
become small as 1/√N . For example, the statistical
error becomes 10−3 for N = 106, which can be con-
sidered as small enough. If the statistical error with
a single set of random variables is not small enough,
we can repeat the calculation with M sets of random
variables φ(m)
, M )
· · ·
and obtain the statistical error of order of 1/√M N

of the statistical error becomes zero during the Monte
Carlo process since

the diﬃculty in evaluating the exponential operator

4. Numerical Examples

In this section, we show several numerical results to
demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of Particle Source Method.
For simplicity, we calculate only one-body problems.
However, these results include the Hamiltonian matri-
ces of N = 106, which is comparable to the dimension
of the Hamiltonian matrices in manybody problems.
Therefore we believe that our method is the eﬀective
also in manybody problems. All numerical results in
this section have been calculated with complex double
precision arithmetic of FORTRAN.

alytical result (54). For the numerical calculation, we
used parameters, α = 0.1, η = 10−4, δ = 10−2, and
10−2 and N = 106 . The transmission
∆ω = 5
probability calculated by PSM is slightly smaller than
the exact result. This is probably because of the ﬁ-
nite imaginary part of the energy, η = 10−4, which
physically corresponds to the absorbtion of the parti-
cle. The computational time for this calculation was 3
hours on the supercomputer at RIKEN.

5. Summary

×

In this article, we developed the PSM for calcu-
lating the real time Green’s functions of large sparse
N
N Hamiltonian matrices, which exploits the nu-
merical solution of the inhomogeneous time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. The method has a clear-cut
structure reﬂecting the most naive deﬁnition of the
Green’s functions, and is very suitable to parallel and
vector supercomputers.
It requires, as the Lanczos
method, memory space of oder of N , and the CPU
time of oder of N for a given set of parameters. The
PSM can also calculate matrix elements of the prod-
ucts of several Green’s functions and other operator,
while the Lanczos method can calculate matrix ele-
ments of operators that contains only one Green’s func-
tion. This is because PSM can calculate N matrix
, at one calculation, while the

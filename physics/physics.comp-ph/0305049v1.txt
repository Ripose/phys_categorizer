Abstract
This paper is divided in two parts. In the ﬁrst part, a brief review of a spectral element
method for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is
given. The method is then extended to compute buoyant ﬂows described by the Boussi-
nesq approximation. Free convection in closed two-dimensional cavities are computed
and the results are in very good agreement with the available reference solutions.

Key words: Spectral element method, incompressible ﬂow, Boussinesq approximation,
free convection

INTRODUCTION
At the previous conference (Wasberg et al., 2001) we presented a method for the nu-
merical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by spectral element
methods. In this contribution we will present the current status of this development
effort, in particular new developments to enable computation of buoyancy-driven ﬂows
described by the Boussinesq approximation. We will ﬁrst give a review of the sta-
tus of the basic Navier-Stokes solver. Then we describe the Boussinesq model and
discuss its numerical implementation. Simulations of free-convection ﬂows in closed
two-dimensional cavities show very good agreement with available reference solutions.

SPECTRAL ELEMENT METHOD
The Navier-Stokes equations for a constant-density incompressible ﬂuid are

∂u
∂t

+ u · ∇u = −∇p + ν∇2u,

∇ · u = 0,

in Ω,
in Ω,

with the following initial- and boundary conditions:

u(x, 0) = u0(x), x ∈ Ω, ∇ · u0 = 0
u(x, t) = uv(x, t), x ∈ ∂Ωv,
∇u(x, t) · n = 0, x ∈ ∂Ωo.

(1a)

(1b)

The boundary ∂Ω is divided into two parts ∂Ωv and ∂Ωo, with Dirichlet velocity in-
ﬂow and homogeneous Neumann outﬂow conditions, respectively, and n is the outward
pointing normal vector at the boundary.

In (1), Ω ∈ Rd is the computational domain in d spatial dimensions, u = u(x, t)
is the d-dimensional velocity vector, p = p(x, t) is the kinematic pressure, and ν is the
kinematic viscosity coefﬁcient.

To solve (1) we employ an implicit-explicit time splitting in which we represent the
advective term explicitly, while we treat the diffusive term, the pressure term, and the

∗e-mail: thg@fﬁ.no

divergence equation implicitly. After semi-discretisation in time we can write (1) in the
form

(αI − ν∇2)un+1 = ∇p + f (un, un−1, . . . ),

∇ · un+1 = 0,

in which the explicit treatment of the advection term is included in the source term f .
In the actual implementation we use the BDF2 formula for the transient term,

∂u
∂t

=

3un+1 − 4un + un−1
2∆t

+ O(∆t2),

which gives α = 3/2∆t in (2), while we compute the advective contributions according
to the operator-integration-factor (OIF) method (Maday et al., 1990).

The spatial discretisation is based on a spectral element method (Patera, 1984); the
computational domain is sub-divided into non-overlapping quadrilateral (in 2D) or hex-
ahedral (in 3D) cells or elements. Within each element, a weak representation of (2) is
discretised by a Galerkin method in which we choose the test and trial functions from
bases of Legendre polynomial spaces

uh
i ∈ PN (x) ⊗ PN (y) ⊗ PN (z),
ph ∈ PN −2(x) ⊗ PN −2(y) ⊗ PN −2(z).

Note that we employ a lower order basis for the pressure spaces to avoid spurious pres-
sure modes in the solution. The velocity variables are C 1-continuous across element
boundaries and are deﬁned in the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto points for the numerical
integration, whereas the pressure variable is piecewise discontinuous across element
boundaries and are deﬁned in the interior Legendre-Gauss points.

For the spatial discretization we now introduce the discrete Helmholtz operator,

where A and B are the stiffness- and mass matrices in d spatial dimensions, the discrete
divergence operator, D, and the discrete gradient operator, G. Appropriate boundary
conditions should be included in these discrete operators. This gives the discrete equa-
tions

H =

B + νA,

3
2∆t

Hun+1 − Gpn+1 = Bf,

−Dun+1 = 0,

where the change of sign in the pressure gradient term is caused by an integration by
parts in the construction of the weak form of the problem. This discrete system is solved
efﬁciently by a second order accurate pressure correction method that can be written

Hu∗ = Bf + Gpn + r,

DQG(pn+1 − pn) = −Du∗

un+1 = u∗ + QG(pn+1 − pn),

where u∗ is an auxiliary velocity ﬁeld that does not satisfy the continuity equation (4b).

turbulent channel ﬂow.

The discrete Helmholtz operator is symmetric and diagonally dominant, since the
mass matrix of the Legendre discretisation is diagonal, and can be efﬁciently solved
by the conjugate gradient method with a diagonal (Jacobi) preconditioner. The pres-
sure operator DQG is easily computed; it is also symmetric, but ill-conditioned. The
pressure system is solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, with a mul-
tilevel overlapping Schwarz preconditioner (Fischer et al., 2000).

Earlier (Wasberg et al., 2001) we presented a validation of the method for two-
dimensional examples. Since then we have extended the method to compute the full
three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. At present, turbulence simulations of a
fully developed channel ﬂow at Reτ = 180 is in progress. Results of these simulations
will be presented elsewhere.

The method has good data locality and can be efﬁciently run on parallel computers.
We have parallelized the code by message passing (MPI) which enables execution on
both distributed-memory cluster and shared-memory architectures. To demonstrate the
parallel performance, we show in Fig. 1 the speed-up factors for a Direct Numerical
Simulation of three-dimensional fully developed turbulent channel ﬂow using approx-
imately 250000 grid points. The computations were performed on a 16 processor SGI
system.

SOLUTION METHOD FOR BUOYANT FLOW
The equations describing the dynamics of incompressible, viscous, buoyant ﬂows under

the Boussinesq approximation are

∇ · u = 0,

∂u
∂t
∂T
∂t

+ u · ∇T = α∇2T,

+ u · ∇u = −∇p + ν∇2u + β (T − Tref) g,

(6a)

(6b)

(6c)

where T represents the temperature, α the thermal diffusivity, and β the coefﬁcient of
thermal expansion. The Boussinesq approximation is valid provided that the density
variations, ρ(T ), are small; in practice this means that that only small temperature
deviations from the mean temperature are admitted.

The relevant non-dimensional groups to characterize the ﬂow are:

• The Prandtl number Pr = ν/α,

• the Reynolds number Re = UL/ν, and

• the Rayleigh number Ra = gβ∆T L3/να.

Note that the Reynolds number is only relevant for problems with an imposed velocity
scale. The free convection problems we consider below are completely determined by
the Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers.

In this section we will describe the solution method for the Boussinesq problem.
Note that the buoyancy effect is accounted for in (6) through the solution of an addi-
tional scalar advection-diffusion equation and an extra source term in the momentum
equations.

The key to efﬁcient and accurate solution of the Boussinesq/Navier-Stokes system
is to use an implicit-explicit splitting of diffusive and advective terms. In particular,
if the advection/diffusion equations are solved by an implicit/explicit procedure, the
temperature equation can be decoupled from the remaining Navier-Stokes equations,
and the buoyancy source term can be calculated ﬁrst and fed directly to the Navier-
Stokes solver. For illustrative purposes we will discuss the solution procedure in term
of an implicit-explicit ﬁrst order Euler time discretization. Note however that higher
order methods and operator splitting are used in the actual implementation as discussed
for the basic Navier-Stokes solver above. A ﬁrst order semi-discrete solution of the
Boussinesq system can be written

T n+1 − T n
∆t
un+1 − un
∆t

+ (u · ∇T )n = (κ∇2T )n+1,

(7a)

+ (u · ∇u)n = −∇pn+1 + (κ∇2u)n+1 + α

T n+1 − Tref

g, (7b)

(∇ · u)n+1

= 0,

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(7c)

where we have changed the ordering of the equations to emphasize that the temperature
at the new time level, T n+1, can be obtained from old velocity data since the advection
term is treated explicitly. A possible solution algorithm is then self-evident:

1. Solve the advection-diffusion equation to obtain T n+1.

2. Calculate the buoyancy source term.

3. Calculate the explicit contributions to the momentum equations.

Fig. 2: Streamlines and temperature distribution for the side-heated buoyant cavity
ﬂow at Ra = 103.

4. Solve the remaining Stokes problem with the pressure correction method to ob-

tain un+1 and pn+1.

The actual implementation is based on higher-order methods and the operator in-
tegration factor splitting method described above for the advection/diffusion equations
(both for temperature and momentum). The method uses second order accurate inte-
grators; for the advection terms we use an adaptive Runge-Kutta method, while the
implicit parts are solved by the second order implicit Euler scheme (BDF2).

SIMULATIONS OF FREE CONVECTION CAVITIES
We have performed simulation of the free convection in two-dimensional square and
rectangular cavities. Cavity ﬂows are often used as test cases for code validation, be-
cause they are simple to set up and reliable reference solutions are readily available.
Furthermore, thermal cavity ﬂows display a plethora of interesting ﬂuid dynamic phe-
nomena, and they are important prototype ﬂows for a wide range of practical techno-
logical problems, including ventilation, crystal growth in liquids, nuclear reactor safety,
and the design of high-powered laser systems.

Differentially heated square cavity
The steady-state differentially heated square cavity ﬂow was the subject of one of the
ﬁrst benchmark comparison exercises reported in (de Vahl Davis & Jones, 1983). The
benchmark results produced in that exercise are given in (de Vahl Davis, 1983). The
results of de Vahl Davis were produced, for Rayleigh numbers in the range 103–106,
using a stream-function/vorticity formulation discretised by a second-order ﬁnite dif-
ference method on a regular mesh. Later, more accurate results obtained by a sec-
ond order ﬁnite volume method on higher resolution non-uniform grids were presented
in (Hortmann et al., 1990).

The problem comprises a square box of side length Lx = Ly = L ﬁlled with a
Boussinesq ﬂuid characterized by a Prandtl number, Pr = 0.71. The vertical walls are
kept at a constant temperature, Thot and Tcold, respectively while the horizontal lid and
bottom are insulated with zero heat ﬂux. The direction of gravity is downwards, i.e. in
the negative y-direction.

We performed calculations for 103 ≤ Ra ≤ 106, and at these Rayleigh numbers the
ﬂow is stationary. We show the computed ﬂow ﬁeld and temperature distributions in
Figs. 2–5.

The most important diagnostic connected to the free convection cavity ﬂow is the
average Nusselt number, which expresses the non-dimensional heat ﬂux across the cav-
ity. The Nusselt number is usually calculated at a vertical line, typically the hot and
the cold wall. For consistency with the weak Galerkin formulation, we have however
chosen to compute a global Nusselt number given by

where Q is the calculated global heat ﬂux through the cavity

and the reference value, Q0, is the corresponding heat ﬂux if the heat transfer were by
pure conduction

(8a)

(8b)

(8c)

We have conﬁrmed that the computed values of the average global Nusselt number does
indeed agree with the average wall Nusselt numbers.

We performed simulations using M = 4 × 4 elements varying the resolution in each
element from N = 6 × 6 to N = 24 × 24. In Figs. 6–8 we show the grid convergence
of the computed Nusselt numbers compared to the previously reported benchmark re-
sults (de Vahl Davis, 1983) and (Hortmann et al., 1990). Note the excellent agreement
with the reference data; even the coarsest resolution (i.e. 24 × 24) produces solutions
that are essentially converged except at the highest Rayleigh number. In Table 1 we
compare the Nusselt numbers obtained at the ﬁnest grid with the ‘grid-independent’
values from the reference solutions obtained by Richardson extrapolation.

Bottom-heated square cavity
It is also interesting to consider the case in which the cavity is heated from below
instead of from the vertical walls as in the above examples. When the heated walls are
aligned with the direction of gravity the circulation, and hence convection, is set up at
small Rayleigh numbers. Although the bottom-heated case corresponds to a genuinely
unstable situation; gravity will act against the instability caused by the temperature
difference and produce a regime of pure conduction at low Ra. To illustrate this we
show the effect of conduction expressed by the deviatory Nusselt number, i.e. Nu −
1, for the two cases in Fig. 9. Note that whereas there is a smooth transition into
the convection regime in the wall-heated case, the bottom-heated case shows a sharp

point the difference between the two cases, both with respect to the heat transfer and to
the ﬂow ﬁeld, is small as we can see in Fig. 10.

Simulation of a tall cavity
Christon et al. (2002) summarises the results of a workshop discussing the free con-
vection in a tall cavity with aspect ratio 8:1. The comparison was performed for
a Rayleigh number Ra = 3.4 × 105, which is slightly above the transition point
from steady-state to time-dependent ﬂow at Ra ≈ 3.1 × 105. A total of 31 solutions
were submitted to the workshop, of these a pseudo-spectral solution using 48 × 180
modes (Xin & Le Qu´er´e, 2002) was selected as the reference solution.

We have computed the solution to this case with roughly the same resolution as
in the steady-state computations of the square cavity reported above. We show the
time history of the global Nusselt number in Fig. 11, and note that the ﬂow reaches a
statistically steady state after approximately 1500 non-dimensional time units

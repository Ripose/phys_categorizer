Abstract

A simple model of random Brownian walk of a spherical mesoscopic particle in viscous liquids is proposed.
The model can be both solved analytically and simulated numerically. The analytic solution gives the known
Eistein-Smoluchowski diﬀusion law hr2
i = Dt where the diﬀusion constant D is expressed by the mass and
geometry of a particle, the viscosity of a liquid and the average eﬀective time between consecutive collisions
of the tracked particle with liquid molecules. The latter allows to make a simulation of the Perrin experiment
and verify in detailed study the inﬂuence of the statistics on the expected theoretical results. To avoid the
problem of small statistics causing departures from the diﬀusion law we introduce in the second part of
the paper the idea of so called Artiﬁcially Increased Statistics (AIS) and prove that within this method of
experimental data analysis one can conﬁrm the diﬀusion law and get a good prediction for the diﬀusion
constant even if trajectories of just few particles immersed in a liquid are considered.

Introduction

Recently a big progress has been made in application of digital technique in experimental physics what allows to
perform milestone physics experiments even in student laboratories. A good example is the Perrin experiment [1]
considered as the ﬁrst one directly proving the atomic structure of matter. However, its veriﬁcation at university
laboratories [2],[3],[4],[5] due to small statistics one takes, may meet some diﬃculties (see e.g.[2],[4],[5]). The
linear dependence between the average square displacement hr2i of the particle in media due to its Brownian
motion and the observation time t as required by the Einstein-Smoluchowski diﬀusion law often becomes very
problematic.
It is essential therefore to examine the minimal statistics (number of tracked particles) one should take into
account in the limited observation time to reveal the major feature of the diﬀusion law. We propose the
analytical model which can be also easy simulated numerically. The aim of this model is to investigate how the
results of hr2i versus t depend on the statistics and what the scaling range of the expected linear relationship
is. This study should help to set up the experiment properly as well as to analyze the obtained results more
correctly.
In the next section we present the model directly reﬂecting the physics standing behind the Perrin experiment.
In section 3 the results of numerical simulation of this model are described and main features of diﬀusion relation
with its scaling range are revealed for various number of particles to be observed. To avoid the problem of small
statistics causing departures from the strict power law behavior we introduce and discuss the idea of Artiﬁcially
Increased Statistics(AIS) in section 4. This method is then applied both to results of numerical simulation and

1

to some experimental data. We argue the method may signiﬁcantly decrease the level of statistical noise in data
leading to much better agreement with the linear dependence in diﬀusion theory. In the last section summary
of obtained results is given.

2 Description of the Model

The most popular derivation of diﬀusion law in media with viscosity comes from Einstein [6], Langevin [7]
and Smoluchowski [8]. Here we propose another approach based on the time series analysis combined with the
average time τ between consecutive collisions of the tracked mesoscopic particles with other particles in liquid
(i.e. τ has the meaning of the average time between collisions which signiﬁcantly change the motion of the
tracked object). Such approach seems to be closer to the spirit of the original Perrin experiment [1].
Let the trajectory of the observed particle of mass m moving in d-dimensional space is xα(t), where α = 1, 2, ..., d.
We assume xα(t) to be discrete d-dimensional time series with constant spacing τ in time (t = 0, τ, 2τ, ..., N τ ).
The obvious notation

xα(kτ ) = xα

k , k = 1, 2, ..., N

will be applied, where ∆xα
For the stationary, integer Brownian motion with no drift one has:

k+1 − xα
k
k is the instantenous displacement of the particle at t = kτ .

where h.in is the average taken over the ensamble of n tracked particles and (σα

The total mean squared displacement hr2in of particles from their initial positions after N collisions can be

In order to calculate σ2 let us notice that

Therefore eq.(6) reads:

The above formula is the standard diﬀusion law with the diﬀusion constant

expressed in terms of τ .

Usually one writes D in terms of liquid viscosity η as

h∆r2in = (

dkT

τ )t

D =

D =

α

where α = 6π̺η (Stokes law) and ̺ being the radius of the considered mesoscopic particles.

Hence one gets the simple relation between parameter τ in the model and macroscopic quantities m, α:

m
α
Thus the model reproducing the known diﬀusion law also estimates the average time τ lapsing between
consequtive collisions in the system as the simple function of macroscopically measured quantities. This time
can be taken as the input parameter in the numerical study of the Perrin experiment what is done in the next
section.

3 Numerical Simulation of the Perrin Experiment

The solution in eq.(10) can be checked via numerical simulation of the Brownian motion in viscous media. In
fact this simulation is the only way one can ﬁnd the suﬃcient statistics, i.e. the number of tracked particles in
the ensamble one should observe in real experiment to obtain results conﬁrming the linear relation. If suﬃcient
statistics requirement is not satisﬁed, one observes signiﬁcant departures from the linear behavior hr2in ∼ t (see
e.g. ref. [2],[4]).

We simulated all time series {xα

i } in d = 2 dimensions usually discussed by experimentalists. The time series

were built in the well known iterative way

1/2

where displacements have been generated as the random gaussian numbers N (0, σ), with the standard
deviation σ = τ (kT /m)
obtained from eqs.(8),(9). All simulations were performed for the case of diﬀusion
in pure water (η = 1.00 × 10−3P a · s), room temperature T = 295K, m = 4.28 × 10−16kg and ̺ = 425nm what
roughly corresponds to the real Perrin experiment parameters.
The essential task to be done just in the beginning was to determine the scaling range λ of the discussed
linear dependence as a function of the number of tracked particles n. It was done for the bunch of simulated
trajectories varying the number of observed particles in the range n = 10÷500. The bunch of twenty trajectories
was investigated for any n in the above range. The examples of just ﬁve runs in each bunch (for the clarity of
ﬁgure we do not show all the runs) are pictured in Fig.1 a-c. Hence we have found the scaling range relation
revealed in Fig.2. The best ﬁt gives

where β = 0.51 ± 0.04 and the uncertainty comes from the statistics.

Let us notice that if the number of observed particles does not exceed 10 the linear dependence hr2in ∼ t can
be conﬁrmed only for the observation time t < 3s! It makes the analysis taking into account longer observation
times (as authors of ref.[4] did), simply incorrect.

Having the scaling range determined we may proceed to calculate the diﬀusion constant value and its expected
standard deviation from the mean. Such analysis was done by us for the simulated trajectories mentioned above.
Some chosen cases (again for the clarity of graph we do not show all of them) with maximal and minimal values
of D for every n are shown in Fig.3 a-c. All results of the mean D values and their standard deviation as the
function of n are presented in Fig.4.

Hence we see that the ﬁnal result within 10% percent of the expected theoretical value can be found only if

one considers the ensamble of n ≥ 50 particles.

4 Analysis of Results with Artiﬁcially Increased Statistics

The results of the previous section are not so optimistic for they seem to suggest that one should take into
account in the real experiment data from at least n ∼ 50 particles to get a reasonable agreement with the
In many less professional labs (e.g. student labs) such a requirement is virtually
diﬀusion law predictions.
impossible to be satisﬁed - mainly because of the limited time duration of the data collection if no sophisticated
computerised apparatus is used. Below we give the idea that helps to overcome such a diﬃculty. We call it
Artiﬁcially Increased Statistics (AIS).
The main idea of AIS is to build the statistics of consecutive displacements from the very small number of
available trajectories, counting all the displacements not from the initial starting point (x1
0) = (0, 0) but
k, x2
varying it along the whole one particle trajectory. Thus any momentary position of the particle, say (x1
k), k =
l−k, ∆x2
1, 2, ..., N is the starting point to collect statistics of all displacements afterwards, i.e.:(∆x1
l−k), l > k,
where ∆xα
k is the α-th part of the (l − k) step displacement. This way for the time series of length
N we have N − m data for m-steps displacements instead of just one displacement usually taken into account
(see Fig 5). Then the statistics is averaged in the usual way over the all considered (observed) particles. This
way even if n is small the overall number of data entering the statistics is large enough to fulﬁl the linear law
expectation.

l−k = xα

l − xα

0, x2

Let us now look at the results of the application of AIS to the simulated Brownian motion as well as to the

pure experimental data from the real experiments.

In Fig.6 we present the bunch of squared displacements in time taken for the statistics of n = 10 particles
worked out with the AIS procedure. The comparison with the ”naked” data from Fig.3a shows the tremendous
diﬀerence. Although the scaling range after AIS lifting does not seem to change a lot, the linear dependence
< r2 >∼ t is now much more convincing. In fact the comparison of diﬀusion constants D obtained from the
”naked” analysis and from the data lifted by AIS shows about 7 times smaller uncertainty in D evaluation in
the latter case (see Table 1).

The positive feature of AIS procedure can also be seen directly with the pure experimental data. We show
in Fig.7a the data taken in ref.[4] for the diﬀusion of n = 5 latex spherical particles in the pure water. One gets
much better correspondence with the linear dependence when AIS procedure is applied to these experimental
points what is clearly revealed in Fig.7b. The obtained best ﬁt for the diﬀusion constant corresponds now closely
to the expected value D = 2.01 × 10−12m2s−1 what is not the case of the ﬁt obtained by authors of ref.[4].

5 Conclusions

The proper determination of the scaling range for the linear dependence hr2i ∼ t is crucial in the data analysis.
We argued this scaling range behaves like λ ∼ nβ, where the constant β was determined as β ∼ 0.5. The

numerical simulation shows that for the case of mesoscopic particles diﬀusing in water the scaling range for
n ∼ 10 particles is as short as λ < 3s. For n < 10 this scaling range is diﬃcult to determine at all. In many
papers this fact is ignored what gives misleading results.
However, even if one remains in the scaling range regime the results of simulated runs are not always statistically
repeatable if too small statistics is considered. The minimal number of tracked particles to reveal the diﬀusion
law is n ≥ 50. One may nevertheless ﬁnd the reasonable correspondence between theoretical predictions and
experimental results even for the smaller number of tracked particles if the idea of AIS is applied. In this paper
we described this idea and have shown how it works for simulated date as well as for data taken from the real
experiments. It turns out that one may get with AIS analysis results within 10% of the expected one, tracking
just few mesoscopic objects. The same input data without AIS gives much bigger uncertainty of the order of
50% (see Fig.4). To decrease it to the former level of 10% one has to track roughly ten times more objects!
We have checked that for n = 50 tracked particles AIS procedure decreases the statistical uncertainty in D
from about 15% (the ”naked” data case) to ∼ 2%. This way it is quite possible to collect data giving very good
prediction for the diﬀusion constant even in less professional labs where one is not able to measure simultaneously
signals coming from bigger number of objects. Hence, other important physical constants (like e.g. Boltzmann
constant k or the Avogadro number NA) can be deduced with high accuracy what is often the crucial point of
such experiments.
The similar analysis was done by us also for other liquids. The same ﬁnal conclusions as for the case of water
can be formulated. Because of very similar results we did not show them explicitly in this paper but we believe
they should be studied in the way of numerical simulation in any case before the actual experiment starts.

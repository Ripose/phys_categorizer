Abstract

A domain integral method employing a speciﬁc Green’s function (i.e., incorporating some
features of the global problem of wave propagation in an inhomogeneous medium) is developed
for solving direct and inverse scattering problems relative to slab-like macroscopically inhomo-
geneous porous obstacles. It is shown how to numerically solve such problems, involving both
spatially-varying density and compressibility, by means of an iterative scheme initialized with
a Born approximation. A numerical solution is obtained for a canonical problem involving a
two-layer slab.

Introduction

This work was initially motivated by two problems:
i) the design problem connected with the
determination of the optimal proﬁle of a continuous and/or discontinuous spatial distribution of
the material/geometric properties of porous materials for the absorption of sound [7] and ii) the
retrieval of the spatially-varying mechanical and geometrical parameters of bone for the diagnosis
of diseases such as osteoporosis [10].

Such inverse problems [20] can be decomposed into two sub-problems: i) the determination of the
constitutive and conservation relations linking the various spatially-variable mechanical parameters
of the porous medium to its response to an acoustic solicitation, and ii) the resolution of the

wave equation in an inhomogeneous porous medium (for instance, within the Biot, or rigid frame
approximations). Here we focus on the second point.

In [17], it is shown that the wave equation describing the propagation in a macroscopically-
inhomogeneous porous medium in the rigid frame approximation can formally take the form of
the usual acoustic wave equation in a macroscopically-inhomogeneous ﬂuid (in which the micro-
scopic features of the porous medium are homogenized) with spatial (and frequency) dependent
compressibility κe(x, ω) and density ρe(x, ω).

The present work deals with a method of resolution of direct problems involving acoustic wave
propagation in a macroscopically-inhomogeneous ﬂuid medium, whose density and compressibility
are both space dependent, this being a prerequisite to the resolution of related inverse problems.

This topic is also of great interest in quantum physics (inverse potential scattering [2, 37, 38, 39]),
ocean acoustics [9, 8, 32, 11, 36, 12] (detection of inhomogeneities, sediment exploration, inﬂuence
of seawater and seaﬂoor composition and heterogenity on the long-range propagation of acoustic
waves in the sea, ...), seismology [1, 40, 42] (determination of the internal structure and composition
of the Earth via seismic waves,...), geophysics [42, 25, 48, 44] (characterization of soil, detection of
geological features such as hydrocarbon reservoirs, ...), optics and electromagnetism [47, 41] (design
and characterization of materials having speciﬁed response to waves, detection of ﬂaws,...).

The wave equation in an inhomogeneous medium can be solved in a variety of manners: via the
wave splitting method [33, 17, 30], the transfer matrix method [28, 4] (for piecewise constant media),
integral methods [20, 39, 37], or purely numerical (e.g., ﬁnite-element [19] or ﬁnite-diﬀerence [5])
methods. The methods dedicated to inverse problems are wave splitting and linearisation [38, 39]
techniques deriving from the integral formalism. The two most widely-known approximations for
the Fredholm equations of the second kind involved in the integral formalism (at least when the
density is constant in the acoustic context) are the Born approximation [35, 39] and the Rytov
approximation [23]. We will focus on the Born approximation, despite the fact that several authors
[27, 13] have shown that the Rytov approximation is valid under a less restrictive set of conditions
than the Born approximation.

We postulate, and show, that the accuracy of the Born approximation can be increased by
the use of the integral formulation together with a speciﬁc Green’s function [37, 39, 46]. In most
of the articles dealing with the Born approximation and other linearisation methods, the prob-
lems are often simpliﬁed by considering the density to be constant. Herein, we consider both the
compressibility and the density to be spatially-variable. This induces supplementary diﬃculties,
because it can lead to meaningless integrals (involving ﬁrst and/or second space derivatives of the
density), especially when the variation of the density is not continuous, and/or because it requires
the evaluation of the ﬁrst space derivative of the pressure ﬁeld. We will show how to deal with
these problems.

The usual ﬁrst-order Born approximation is an outcome of the integral formulation employing
the free-space Green’s function (FSGF) and consists in approximating the pressure ﬁeld in the
integrand (corresponding to the pressure ﬁeld inside the heterogeneity) by the ﬁeld in the absence
of the heterogeneity (i.e.
the incident ﬁeld), this being equivalent to the asssumption that the
diﬀracted ﬁeld is negligible compared to the incident ﬁeld. Although this method usually provides
good results for small contrasts between the mechanical parameters of the inhomogeneity and those
of the host medium, its accuracy decreases in the case of dissipative media and larger contrasts.

Moreover, iterative schemes initialized with the zeroth-order Born or Rytov approximations
often diverge in practice. This diﬃculty can be partially resolved by employing the modiﬁed or

2

distorted Born approximation [39] which basically consist in acting on one of the three terms
involved in the integrand (the Green’s function, the contrast function and the ﬁeld inside the
heterogeneity).

The method described herafter allows us to act on all three terms. The central idea of our
method consists in reducing the eigenvalues of the kernel of the integrand (thought to be the
cause of the diﬃculties with the usual iterative Born scheme) by employing a Green’s function–the
so-called Speciﬁc Green’s function (SGF)– of a canonical problem which is close, in some sense,
to the original problem. The speciﬁcation of the initial solution was already treated in [46] in
connection with the resolution of an inverse problem. The chosen problem (also canonical) is that
of the diﬀraction of an incident plane wave, propagating in the host medium, by a two-component
slab (each component being a homogeneous layer) considered as a single inhomogeneous slab. In
the present instance, the close canonical problem involves a slab ﬁlled with a macroscopically-
homogeneous ﬂuid-saturated porous medium surrounded by the same ﬂuid (air) medium as the
original macroscopically-inhomogeneous ﬂuid-saturated porous medium.

We will show, for this example:

i) how to construct an appropriate speciﬁc Green’s function
(SGF), ii) how to incorporate the latter into the integral formulation, and iii) how the resulting
integral equation can be solved by an iterative scheme initialized by a modiﬁed Born approximation.
The results are compared to those of the analytic solutions (obtained by the transfer matrix
method (TMM)) for the two-component slab and found to be in good agreement with the latter,
both in transmission and reﬂection and for several angles of incidence. The iterative scheme initial-
ized with the modiﬁed Born approximation converges rather rapidly, i.e., within 5 to 7 iterations for
our example. This demonstrates the eﬃciency of our SGF interative scheme for the resolution of the
direct problem relative to wave propagation in the presence of a macroscopically-inhomogeneous
ﬂuid-saturated porous slab.

2 Use of the speciﬁc Green’s functions in the domain integral

formulation to solve direct scattering problems

2.1 An example of a direct scattering problem

The type of direct problem we deal with is illustrated in ﬁgure 1a. This problem involves spatially-
dependent compressibility and density. As will be shown further on, the spatial variability, and
discontinuity, of both these quantities, and in particular of the latter, can produce some diﬃculties
in the domain integral formulations (but not in the TMM formulation). The wave equation for
such problems is given in appendix A; to solve them in optimal manner, we treat the auxiliary
problem depicted in ﬁgure 1b.

2.2 Speciﬁc Green’s function corresponding to the propagation of waves radi-
ated by interior and exterior line sources in the presenece of a homogeneous
ﬂuid-like layer immersed in a homogeneous ﬂuid host medium

2.2.1 Features of the problem

The sagittal plane (cross-section) view of the scattering conﬁguration is given in ﬁgure 1b. As we
are dealing with a Green’s function, the supports of the sources reduce to dots in the ﬁgure, i.e.,
the sources are line sources. The homogeneous ﬂuid-like layer is oriented horizontally (i.e. the
normal to both of its faces is along the x2 axis); its thickness is l, and the medium M 1 therein is
homogeneous. The geometry and composition of the layer are thus invariant with respect to x3. Ω1
designates the trace of the layer in the x1 −
x2 cross-section plane. Γa and Γb designate the traces
x2 cross-section plane. The unit
of the lower and upper faces respectively of the layer in the x1 −
vectors normal to Γa and Γb are designated indistinctly by ν. The x2 coordinates of Γa and Γb are
designated by a and b respectively.

The layer is immersed in a (host) ﬂuid M 0. The trace of the host medium domain below (above)

x2 cross-section plane is designated by Ω0+ (Ω0−).

The (direct scattering) problem is to determine the response g0+

the layer in the x1 −
within Ω0−
and g1 within Ω1 for line sources that are located either within Ω0+, Ω0− or Ω1. This response
constitutes the speciﬁc Green’s function we are looking for.

within Ω0+, g0−

Let y designate the vector from O to the location of the line source. The Green’s function in

Ωj is designated by gj(x, y), which means the response at x due to line sources located at y.

2.2.2 Governing equations

Rather than to solve directly for gj(x, y, t), we prefer to deal with its Fourier transform gj(x, y, ω)

2.3 Use of a speciﬁc Green’s function to solve the direct problem of pressure

wave scattered by an inhomogeneous ﬂuid-ﬁlled slab

We treat the 2D ﬂuid acoustic direct problem illustrated in ﬁgure 2. In the absence of the het-
erogeneity, occupying the domain Ω2, the conﬁguration is that of the closed layer domain Ω1
occupied by a known homogeneous ﬂuid M 1 with (spatially-constant) acoustic parameters (k1, ρ1),
surrounded by the open domain Ω0 occupied by a known homogeneous ﬂuid M 0 with (spatially-
constant) acoustic parameters (k0, ρ0).

In the presence of the heterogeneity, localized to the domain Ω2 ∈

Ω1, the problem is to solve the
scattering problem for spatially-varying acoustic parameter functions (k2(x), ρ2(x)) of the medium
M 2 ﬁlling Ω2 in the subdomains Ω0+ and Ω0− when the slab is probed by an incident wave.

wherein ps(y) is the ﬁeld scattered by the inhomogeneity of the slab.

wherein pd(y, ω) is the ﬁeld diﬀracted by the entire inhomogeneous slab (including the slab itself
and its inhomogeneities). The SGF formulation thus appears to be more suitable than the FSGF
formulation, because the scattered ﬁeld ps(y, ω) accounts at the outset for more of the physics of
the interaction of the obstacle with the incident wave than pd(y).

It can be shown that the neglected ﬁeld is generally smaller in the SGF formulation than in the
FSFG formulation. Eﬀectively, when the SGF formulation is employed, the zeroth order Born ap-

The use of the SGF includes some multiple reﬂections, while the FSGF formulation combined
with the Born approximation does not apply to high contrasts, because the employed linearization
tacitly precludes multiple reﬂections.

wherein α(ω, x2) is the absorption coeﬃcient and j = 0 for the FSGF and j = 1 for SGF. It has
been shown in [26] that the Born approximation is reasonable if the phase shift introduced by the
inhomogeneous medium is less than π, i.e., weak and smooth heterogeneities of simple shape. The
shift depends not only on the size, but also on the kernel, (eq. 55), i.e., on the frequency, on the
absorption, and on the contrast between the two phase velocities. The use of the SGF, when the
initial conﬁguration is a homogeneous slab ﬁlled with a ﬂuid-saturated porous material, allows us:
i) to reduce the frequency dependence of the kernel, ii) to reduce the kernel itself by taking into
account a phase-velocity that is closer to that of the host medium and also by taking into account
the absorption (dissipation) of the material, and iii) to provide more accuracy, in the sense that
on the one hand, the speciﬁc Green’s function already accounts for dissipation and for some of the
geometry of the problem and, on the other hand, the approximation of the ﬁeld in the integral
is more realistic than when the FSFG is employed. The usual way (i.e. when the FSFG is used)
to avoid the problem induced by the absorption consists in adding some dissipation term in the
approximated ﬁeld in the integrand (Modiﬁed Born approximation), but not by acting directly on
the kernel of the integral. Methods such as the distorted Born approximation, whose convergence

12

analysis has been carried out in [43], also allow to consider objects with larger contrast, but by acting
only on the constrast function, i.e., without introducing additional eﬀects on the approximated ﬁeld
in the integrand and on the Green’s function used in the formulation.

The SGF domain integral formulation thus allows the elimination of some of the disavantages
of the FSGF domain integral formulation. This is obtained by acting on the kernel, the Green’s
function and the approximated pressure ﬁeld, contrary to other methods employing the FSFG
which act only on one or two of the components of the integrand.

The combined eﬀects of this action is to allow us to deﬁne and implement an iterative scheme,
starting with the zeroth-order Born approximation and using the SGF formulation, to solve wave
propagation problems involving a medium, whose components have high constrasts and in which
there exist abrupt heterogeneities, so to consider objects with larger constrats, with respect to the
surrounding medium, than would be possible with the conventional FSGF formulation.

4 Speciﬁc ingredients of the computational procedure for the pre-
diction of the ﬁeld scattered by an inhomogeneous porous slab
solicited by a plane incident wave.

We now adapt the previous analysis to the determination of the ﬁeld scattered by an inhomogeneous
slab (the direction of inhomogeneity being x2) solicited by an incident plane wave.

This type of incident wave is associated with s0 = 0, so that it would appear that there is no
solicitation in the above equations. Nevertheless, for an incident plane wave initially propagating
in Ω0+, the integral over Γ∞
0+, (39), does not vanish. It follows that the term corresponding to the
solicitation takes the form of p0+
(y), which are the responses in the subdomains
Ω0+, Ω1 and Ω0− respectively (i.e. the zeroth-order Born approximation) to an incident plane wave
propagating initially in Ω0+

4.2 The iterative scheme for solving the direct problem

As pointed out previously, our aim is to deﬁne an iterative scheme to solve the direct problem of
the diﬀraction of an incident plane wave by a heterogeneous porous slab. This would be of great
interest for both the direct and inverse problems, due to the possible increased accuracy it can
enable with respect to both the zeroth- and ﬁrst-order Born approximations (in both the SGF and
FSGF formulations).

We want to compute the total ﬁelds in Ω0+ and Ω0−. These problems being formally similar,

we will only detail the computation of p(y) ; y

Ω0+.
Let p0+(j)(y) and p1(j)(y) designate the j-th iterates of the pressure ﬁelds in Ω0+ and Ω1

∈

respectively. The iterative scheme proceeds as follows:

(cid:16)(cid:0)

Calculation of p0+(1)(y) through (60), corresponding to the application of the Born approxi-
mation in the SGF formulation.

More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst have to calculate the pressure ﬁeld in Ω1 by means of

5 Outline of the numerical procedure

We focus on the response of a double layer (each layer being homogeneous) porous slab (called layer1
and layer2), considered to be a single inhomogeneous slab. We assume that the medium in the slab
responds to a solicitation as does an equivalent ﬂuid (i.e., this is the rigid-frame approximation).

In an equivalent ﬂuid medium, [17] the appropriate conservation of momentum and constitutive

relations take the form:

Special attention must be paid to:

the discretisation of x2 in order to correctly model eventual jumps,

•

•

the modeling of the jump; as pointed out in appendix A, the spatial dependence of the
density ρ(x) can lead to meaningless integrals, especially when this parameter presents some
discontinuities. To avoid this problem, we will consider such jumps to be well-approximated
by the continuous function

where e is the location of the jump, s the slope of the smooth jump and erf the error function,

the determination of the parameters ρ1(ω) and k1(ω) ﬁlling the initial homogeneous slab.

•

5.1 Choice of the discretization step.

Because of the necessary correct modeling of the continuous steps, making use of the formulae (74)
at both the location of the step and the sides of the slab, we consider a logarithmic scale, with an
increase of the point density at these locations. This logarithmic scale occurs over a width ∆ on
both sides of a jump. In our computations, ∆ is chosen equal to 8

10−6.

×

5.2 Choice of the modeling of the jumps

To model the jumps at x2 = 0, we deﬁne a function ζ such that :

ζ(x2) = ζ1 +

(1 + erf(

ζ1)

(ζ2 −
2

x2 −
s

e

))

(75)

(76)

(77)

where ζ(x2) can be φ(x2), λ(x2), λ′(x2), α(x2), or σ(x2), and the indices 1 and 2 refer to the values
of the parameter ζ of the homogeneous layer 1 or 2. The quantities ρ(x2) and k(x2) are then
computed.

Once ρ1 and k1 are determined, in order to take into account the jumps at both (or at least

one) sides of the entire slab, we compute:

ρ(x2) = ρ1 + (ρ(x2)

ρ1)

erf(

−

(cid:18)

x2 −
s

b

)

−

erf(

x2 −
s

a

)

.

−

1
(cid:19)

Thus, on both sides of the slab we model the “half” jump from ρ1 to ρ(x2) using a half of the erf
function (compared to the jump inside the entire slab). This constitutes a better ﬁt of the real
jump.

In all our computations, the parameter s is chosen equal to 2

10−6.

×

5.3 Choice of parameters ρ1(ω) and k1(ω).

The purpose of the SFG is to reduce the kernel of the integral (53) compared to the kernel of
the integral (54) in the FSGF formulation. Because of the spatial dependence of the density, the
integral (53) can be split into two integrals whose respective kernels are:

(k1)2

and

ρ

.

(cid:0)

[b, a], as shown ﬁgure 3 for

(cid:1)
The easiest way to reduce these kernels would be (referred-to as choice 1.), all the characteristic
parameters of the slab being known, to consider the average value of ρ(x2, ω) and k(x2, ω) over
x2 ∈
Another choice (referred-to as choice 2.), which can be more convenient, consists in taking ρ1(ω)
and k1(ω) equal to the minimal value of ρ(x2, ω) and k(x2, ω) over x2 ∈
[b, a], as shown ﬁgure 4.
This choice would normally lead to the disappearance of the remanent density (i.e. equal to ρ1
whose values is larger than ρ(b)) at x2 = b, ﬁgure 3. Another advantage of this choice is the
reduction of the interval of integration , the ﬁrst kernel vanishing over a part of this interval.

These experiments show that the correct choice of ρ1(ω) and k1(ω) is indeed to consider the
average value of ρ(x2, ω) and k(x2, ω) over x2 ∈
[b, a]. This choice leads to a quicker and better
convergence than the one obtained by the choice of ρ1(ω) and k1(ω) as the minimum of ρ(x2, ω)
[b, a].

For small angles of incidence, the usual FGIM converges, ﬁgure 8 and 7, but slower and with
less accuracy than our SGIM (ﬁgure 5). For large angles of incidence (in our example,
), the
usual FGIM strongly diverges, ﬁgure 7, while our method still rapidly converges. This is probably

π

22

caused by the fact that the ﬁrst iteration is far from the exact solution (ﬁgure 8). The translation
of this divergence can be appreciated in (ﬁgure 6).

gives good results as shown ﬁgure 9 and 10. Our method yields solutions that are close to those
of the usual TMM both in transmission and reﬂection in both the frequency and the time domain
for several angles of incidence. This validates the method employing the SGF, combined with an
iterative scheme initialized by a zeroth-order Born approximation.

The time history of the reﬂected pressure ﬁgure 9 is of particular interest for the demonstration
of the accuracy of our method. We can clearly distinguish, for both angles of incidence 0 and
π
, the three reﬂections of the incident wave on the three interfaces of our canonical conﬁgura-
3
tion. The zeroth-order Born approximation, i.e. corresponding to the homogeneous ﬂuid-saturated
porous slab, formally accounts for two of them. For the ﬁrst and third reﬂection, the amplitude
matches correctly with our convergence criterion. The second reﬂection, which comes from the
inhomogeneous slab, matches in both amplitude and time of arrival.

The time history of the transmitted pressure ﬁgure 10 contains only one peak due to the fact
that absorption within the slab attenuates the transmitted waves resulting from multiple reﬂection.

7 Conclusion

A method, making use, in the domain integral formulation, of the speciﬁc Green’s function (SGF),
i.e., the Green’s function of a canonical problem close to the original problem, for the resolution of
problems of acoustic wave propagation in an inhomogeneous ﬂuid medium (with spatially-varying

25

density and compressibility) was studied and implemented for the canonical example of plane wave
solicitation of a double layer ﬂuid-saturated porous slab (considered as a single inhomogeneous
slab) in the rigid frame (equivalent ﬂuid) approximation.

A particular feature of our study is that we account for spatially-varying density, contrary to
many authors who consider it to be constant. We also address the issue of the spatial diﬀerentiation
of the pressure ﬁeld at the boundaries of the inhomogeneity, which is carried by a ﬁnite-diﬀerence
scheme for higher-than-zeroth-order Born approximations.

Our speciﬁc Green’s function iterative scheme, which is initialized by a zeroth-order Born ap-
proximation, was shown to converge, contrary to the iterative scheme relying on the free-space
Green’s function, which is often found to be divergent. This improvement is due to the com-
bined eﬀects of the use of the SGF and to a better Born-like approximation of the ﬁeld inside the
heterogeneity.

In our numerical examples, our method was found to converge within 5-7 iterations to the
reference solution (obtained rigorously by the transfer matrix method), even for an abrupt hetero-
geneity, and for various choices of the acoustic parameters ﬁlling the homogeneous slab supposed
to be the initial conﬁguration (canonical problem) for the SGF.

The robustness of the method was also demonstrated.
Our method thus appears useful for the resolution of inverse problems. In such a context, some
information about the geometry and/or the mechanical properties of the objects one is looking for,
is often known. The SGF is the device by which this information can be incorporated into the
inversion procedure in a rational manner.

A.1 Solution of the direct problem involving both the pressure and its partial

derivative

Wave propagation, relative to an acoustic wave in an inhomogeneous ﬂuid occupying a domain

Ω = Ω0 ∪
occupies the domain Ω1), is described by:

A.3 A canonical problem involving a density discontinuity.

Let us consider the simple 1D problem, depicted in ﬁgure 11, of a plane wave striking a planar
interface Γ, located at x2 = a, between two homogeneous media Ω0 and Ω1. The normally-incident
plane wave travels initially in Ω0. The heterogeneity is supposed to be the domain Ω1.

In practice, this problem can be treated rigorously by the TMM method. However, when one

attempts to solve it by the integral method, the medium ﬁlling Ω1 must be dissipiative.

Let us suppose that the pressure ﬁeld p1 in Ω1 is known (for example, calculated by the TMM

method).

Abstract

We present a multigrid scheme for the solution of ﬁnite-element
Hartree-Fock equations for diatomic molecules. It is shown to be fast
and accurate, the time eﬀort depending linearly on the number of
variables. Results are given for the molecules LiH, BH, N2 and for the
Be atom in our molecular grid which agrees very well with accurate
values from an atomic code. Highest accuracies were obtained by
applying an extrapolation scheme; we compare with other numerical
methods. For N2 we get an accuracy below 1 nHartree.

1 Introduction

For benchmark calculations in Hartree-Fock it is necessary to have a very
good accuracy. This may be achieved through numerical methods like ﬁnite
diﬀerences [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Recently, the accuracy
has been pushed to the sub-µHartree range by employing more than 10000
points in a 2-dimensional ﬁnite diﬀerence grid[14]. Alternatively a ﬁnite-
element program was developed which gave quite accurate results [17, 18]
with less points. However, the time eﬀort of this method scales quadratically
in the number of unknowns.

In recent papers by Kopylow et al.[21, 22] it was shown that a multi-
grid approach for solving ﬁnite element equations applied to the Kohn-Sham
equations of density functional theory gives fast and accurate results.

Extrapolation methods [23, 24, 25] are a tool to gain better accuracy from
a sequence of values for a given property for which the asymptotic behaviour
is known. They have been successfully applied to MP2 correlation ener-
gies for closed shell atoms [26] where several orders of magnitude have been
gained. More recent is the application to one-electron Dirac-FEM solutions
for diatomics [27] which yields also several orders gain in accuracy.

In this paper we present a scheme which utilizes multigrid techniques
[19, 20] and scales linear in the number of variables. Extrapolation methods
are employed in addition in order to further improve the accuracy.

In part 2 we describe the Hartree-Fock approximation used. In part 3
our coordinate transformation is given. In part 4 we state the discretization
of the Hartree-Fock equations by the ﬁnite-element method. And in part 5
we explain the multigrid scheme that is used. In part 6 we give results both
directly calculated and extrapolated for Be, BH, LiH and N2 and compare
with other work[2, 7, 14].

2 Hartree-Fock Method

Microscopic physical systems like molecules are described by wavefunctions
whose behaviour is governed by the Hamiltonian of the system. Often one
is only interested in the energy levels of the system which are given through
the eigenvalue equation

HΨ = EΨ

The eigenfunction Ψ is a many-body wavefunction. Equation 1 can be solved
analytically for a few physical systems only. For others it is necessary to
make approximations like the Hartree-Fock method where a single determi-
nant serves as the ansatz function for the many-body wave function(Slater
determinant). For electronic systems the Hamiltonian is

N

H =

Ti +

Vi +

Vee(|~ri − ~rj|)

Xi=1

Xi=1

Xi<j

where Ti denotes the kinetic energy operator − ¯h2
i of a single electron, Vi =
Vext(~ri) is a given external potential and Vee the interaction potential between
electrons. The variation of the single particle wave functions φj(orbitals) in
the Slater determinant results in the Hartree-Fock equations:

2m∇2

ˆT + Vext(~r) + VDir(~r)

φj(~r) −

Vji(~r)φi(~r) = ǫjφj(~r)

Xi

∆Vji(~r) = −4πρji(~r)
∆VDir(~r) = −4πρ(~r)

where ρ(~r) = ρ(~r, ~r) is the density, the diagonal part of the density matrix
ρ(~r, ~r′) =
i (~r) the exchange density. We
i Vji(~r)φi(~r) and Hlok = ˆT + Vext(~r) + VDir(~r). Equation 3
now deﬁne gj

then takes the form
P

i (~r′)φi(~r) and ρji(~r) = φj(~r)φ∗

i φ∗
x =

Hlokφj(~r) − gj

x = ǫjφj(~r)

Equations 4-6 are solved iteratively (SCF iteration) in the following way.
First we take a trial set of functions φi, compute VDir and Vji and get Hlok
and gj

x. Then one calculates an (approximate) eigenvalue ˜ǫj:

and solves directly the inhomogeneous equation system

(Hlok − ˜ǫj)φj = gj

x, j = 1, . . . , N

(8)

in order to get new wave functions {φi}. Then these new wave functions are
orthogonalized from the functions with the lowest to the highest eigenvalues
˜ǫi of occupied states(Gram Schmidt method). For these wavefunctions the
total energy is computed as the expectation value for the corresponding Slater
determinant. From these {φj} new VDir, Vji and Hlok, gj
x are computed and
equations 7, 8 solved again. This process is re-iterated till a wanted accuracy
in the total energy or the energy levels of the orbitals is obtained. In order
to get stable and fast convergence the direct potential is mixed with the old
one: VDir = pmix ∗ V old

Dir + (1 − pmix) ∗ V new

Dir ; pmix = 0.95.

3 Diatomic molecules

Diatomic molecules have axial symmetry, Lz commutes with H and thus
leads to good quantum numbers mj = lz,j. We take a restricted Hartree-Fock
approach and demand the symmetry of the single-particle wavefunction to
have axial symmetry also. This leads to the ansatz in cylindrical coordinates
for the orbitals.

φj(r, ϕ, z) = fj(r, z)eimj ϕ

The two-center point nucleus Coulomb singularities are best described by
elliptic hyperbolic coordinates:

where rk is the distance to th k-th nucleus(k=1,2) and R the internuclear
distance. These coordinates remove the singularity of the Coulomb poten-
tial which is necessary for a high order convergence behaviour of the ﬁnite-
element method. For the computation of best energies in closed shell systems
the prolate spheroidal coordinates are favorably used which emerge after a
singular coordinate transformation(the back transform is singular at the nu-
clear centers, i.e. at ξ=1(s=0), η = ±1(t = 0, π)).

This singular transform improves the analytic properties of polynomial ansatz
functions in s,t considerably in a ﬁnite-element approach even though it
leads to a problematic behaviour at the inner boundaries ξ=1 (s=0) and
η=±1(t=0,π) respectively. In FEM this diﬃculty is adequately handled by
an open boundary treatment. On the outer boundary we use a closed bound-
ary with boundary values 0.

4 Finite element method

In the ﬁnite element method a variational formulation is generally the start-
ing point. In our case, the variational integral corresponding to equation 8
is:

I =

Z

φ∗
j (

1
2

(Hlok − ˜ǫj)φj − gj

x)d3r

In the ﬁnite-element method(FEM) the space is subdivided into several
subspaces called elements on which locally deﬁned formfunctions Ni are used
i ciNi(~r) and variation with
as approximation. Via the FEM ansatz φ(~r) =
respect to the ci the following equation results:

P

(Hlok,kl − ˜ǫjSkl)c(j)

l = g(j)

At the outer boundary the wavefunctions are set to zero(closed bound-
ary), at the inner boundaries(symmetry axis) the wavefunctions may take
any values(open boundary). Analogously there exists a variational integral
for equation 4:

I =

A corresponding integral exists for the direct potential from equation 5 which
then can be treated in the same way. This leads after insertion of the FEM
ansatz to the linear inhomogeneous equation systems

The outer boundary values for the potentials Vij are computed from a
multipole expansion of the densities ρij up to the ﬁfth order. The ansatz
functions Nk are complete polynomials of order p (p ≤ 7) in s,t and thus
complicated transcendental functions of the real space vector ~r; p is called the
order of the elements and is normally taken to be 4. At the element bound-
aries continuity at the grid points is demanded which due to the serendip
properties of polynomials leads to continuity over the whole element bound-
aries. It can be shown that for large numbers of points n the error due to
the ﬁnite number of points is proportional to 1

np [1].

5 Multigrid method

In order to solve the FEM matrix equations we use a multigrid scheme.
The multigrid method [19, 20] combines the good smoothing behaviour of
iterative methods(e.g. Gauss-Seidel, CG) with an eﬀective elimination of
long-range errors which are treated at coarser grids. In diagram 1 we show
the MG scheme we use. First we solve directly on the coarsest grid(E). Then
this solution is prolongated to the next ﬁner grid(PS). Prolongation is an
interpolation step to the ﬁner grid values where we use all ansatz functions
over each coarse element. If we have a solution from an older scf cycle we
compare the defects of both and take the one with the smaller one(V). If
this vector is not converged we do a V-cycle: First we restrict the defect to
the next smaller grid(RD). The restriction step is done by the transpose of
the interpolation matrix PS,RD = P T
S and is thus of the same (high) order
as the interpolation. If this is not the coarsest grid, we smooth and restrict
the resulting defect to the next coarser grid(S,RD). This is repeated till
the coarsest grid is reached where we solve directly for the defect(D). The
solution of the defect is prolongated to the next ﬁner grid and added to the old
approximation vector(PC,+). This new vector is then smoothed(S). This is
repeated till the level from which the V-cycle started is reached. If the vector
is not converged well enough we repeat the V-cycles till suﬃcient convergence.
Then we prolongate the solution vector(PS) to the next ﬁner grid and repeat
the whole procedure.
In our computations we used 15 conjugate gradient
steps in each smoothing. On the average we needed 2 V-cycles on the ﬁnest
grid per scf iteration for every state φj and potential Vij.

6 Results and Discussion

We ﬁrst present values for BH, LiH and Be using diﬀerent grids ranging from
545 to 16641 points. These results were extrapolated using both inverse
power and rational geometric extrapolation which are described in Flores
and Kolb[26]. For large numbers of points n the energy obeys the following
formula:

E(n) = E∞ +

C
np ,

(24)

where E(n) is the energy for a given number of points, E∞ the exact value,
p the polynomial order and C a constant. The same relationship holds for
all properties except the densities at the nuclei. For the extrapolation of the
densities at the nuclei we took p = 3 for the leading term of the asymptotic
expansion. Fitting of three subsequent densities to the formula D(n) =
D∞ + C

np gave a convergence of the parameter p close to 3.

In table 1 the properties of BH(R=2.336) are given for diﬀerent num-
bers of points and the extrapolated values together with the ﬁnite diﬀerence
results of Laaksonen et al.[2] and, for the total energy and electron levels,
Kobus[7]. Compared with those of Laaksonen et al. our directly computed
results are generally more accurate up to three digits. The only exception
are the densities at the nuclei. For the hydrogen nucleus we are as accurate
as Laaksonen et al. and at the heavier nuclei our directly calculated results
are about two digits less accurate, however by extrapolation we gain 4 dig-
its. This reﬂects the fact that the ﬁnite element method optimizes integral
properties not point-like ones. In most cases our values are diﬀerent from
Laaksonen et al.’s though mostly only in the last digit given by them.

Our results for 16641 points are as accurate as those of Kobus, who had
more than three times the number of points(52441). And our extrapolated
results should be clearly more accurate.

For LiH(R=3.015) the extrapolated values are given in table 2. Our
results agree with the more recent numbers of Kobus but give 2-3 more
digits. Be is computed with the two-center grid where the Be atom is placed
in one center, the other center, R apart, is empty(dummy center). We can
compare with the results of the atomic GRASP code[28]. The total energy
is given for 390 points, the energy levels, due to convergence problems, for
220 points. For the total energy our result disagrees slightly from the Kobus
values but agrees with the GRASP values which shows our values to be more
accurate. For the energy levels the GRASP results agree with both but has

10

to few digits to diﬀerentiate between them.

In ﬁgure 2 the computation times for the solution routines for diﬀerent
numbers of grid points are given. It shows a linear dependence on the number
of points. The same is true for the total time per scf iteration. This allows
us to use rather large numbers of grid points.

In table 3 the convergence of the total energy of N2(R = 2.068) with
respect to the number of points is given up to 148225 points. Here we have
the expected convergence behaviour of the ﬁnite element method where the
leading error term for a high number of grid points is proportional to 1
np (p
being the order of the polynomials used). The extrapolated values were
computed for one sequence without and one with the 148225 point value.
Both are identical apart from the self-consistency error. In order to test the
accuracy of the results we took the truncation parameter d=18 a.u. instead of
25 a.u. in order to test whether the results were dependent on the properties
on the outer boundary. d is the distance between the point on the outermost
ellipse ξmax = const. and a focal point, if the distance is taken perpendicular
to the symmetry axis. The values show a slightly faster convergence because
of the higher density of points in the inner region but converge to the same
result for the higher number of points.

In table 4 the results for 6th-order polynomials with d = 40 a.u. and
7th-order polynomials with d = 18 a.u. are shown. No eﬀect from bound-
ary values or from the diﬀerent orders can be seen up to 1nHartree. The
diﬀerence of the various orders is probably due to the bigger truncation er-
ror accumulation for the higher orders. This shows our results for the total
energy of N2 to be accurate to at least 1 nHartree, and presumably up to
two more digits. The ﬁnite diﬀerence result of Kobus et al. [14] has an error
of 13 nHartree for his 793 × 793 grid lying well in the sub-µHartree level of
accuracy as was claimed. This accuracy can be reached with our standard
method with only 37249 points. For higher orders p it takes only 9409(p=6)
or 3613(p=7) points. In comparison to the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme of Kobus
et al.[14] we can achieve an accuracy which is by al least 2 orders of magni-
tude better with much smaller numbers of grid points and thus remarkably
small computational times for our high precision benchmark results. The
same holds true with respect to the old ﬁnite-element results of Heinemann
[18], where we gain 5-7 digits(see table 5). It should be noted that
et al.
our computation with the highest number of points took less than a day
on an ordinary personal computer. At last, we want to point out that ex-
trapolation schemes have to be applied judiciously. In ﬁgure 3 the relative

11

errors of the total energies are given for diﬀerent grids. Unlike the expected
convergence ∝ 1
np (p=4) one gets an alternating order parameter p. Closer
inspection showed that the grids have alternatingly a diﬀerent geometry. If
grids with the same geometry are taken one gets p → 4 and correspondingly
good extrapolation values.

A novel view of plane wave expansion method in photonic crystals

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We propose a method derived from the simple plane wave expansion that can easily solve the
interface problem between vacuum and a semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal. The method is designed to
ﬁnd the complete set of all the eigenfunctions, propagating or evanescent, of the translation operators
{TR}, at a ﬁxed frequency. With these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues, the transmitted and
reﬂected waves can be determined. Two kinds of applications are presented for 2D photonic crystals.
The ﬁrst is a selection rule for determine the normal direction of the vacuum-photonic crystal
interface to achieve the highest attenuation eﬀect at a gap frequency. The second is to calculate the
transmittance and reﬂectance for a light incident from vacuum to an semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal.
As an example we recalculate a system studied previously by K. Sakoda et al. and get results in
agreement with theirs.

Since Yablonovitch [1, 2, 3] discovered a periodic di-
electric structure that has an absolute gap in the fre-
quency spectrum for electromagnetic waves, the idea of
photonic crystals have attracted great interest. Many
phenomena have been predicted theoretically and many
application possibilities have been explored [2, 4, 5, 6].
Corresponding studies in the early years most authors
paid their attention on the frequency spectrum gaps, and
the most convenient method to calculate the band gaps
is the plane wave expansion method [7, 8]. Recently, var-
ious kinds new methods have been proposed to compute
some other relevant physical parameters such as trans-
mittance and penetration depth [9, 10, 11, 12] for a ﬁnite
system.

In this paper we also address the transmittance and
penetration depth problems, but use a diﬀerent method
that includes all the information of propagating and
evanescent modes getting from the translation operator.
We show that by appropriately modifying the conven-
tional plane wave expansion method we can enlarge its
application region, and which makes it easy to solve the
interface problem between vacuum and a semi-inﬁnite
photonic crystal system.

Our method has several advantages. First, both the
“air rods in dielectric” and “dielectric rods in air” prob-
lems can be solved, without any restriction on the shapes
of the rods and position of cutting plane that separat-
ing the semi-inﬁnite photonic crystal region from the
air region, which is impossible for the LKKR method
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Second, all information getting from
the complete set of the eigenfunctions of the translation
operator are used, including both the propagating and
evanescent modes. This makes it easy to analyze and
discuss phenomena using the well established knowledge
of solid state physics. Third, the ﬁnite size eﬀects such as

∗Electronic address: ychsu.ep87g@nctu.edu.tw
†Electronic address: yangtj@cc.nctu.edu.tw

the resonance behavior of the transmittance curve caused
by the ﬁnite thickness of the photonic crystal sample can
be easily isolated. We can thus accurately calculate the
transmittance and reﬂectance for a very thick photonic
crystal sample.

For a system without free charge and current, and if
the permittivity ǫ(r) and permeability µ(r) are scalars
independent of time, the magnetic ﬁeld H(r, t) satisﬁes

Conventionally, treating Eq. (4) as an eigenvalue prob-
lem, the propagating bulk modes of an inﬁnite periodic
system for a given real k can be obtained straightfor-
wardly. However, in most of the situations we also need
to know the transmittance and reﬂectance of a ﬁnite or
semi-inﬁnite system for a incident light. In order to ob-
tain these quantities, various methods such like LKKR
[10, 12, 13], transfer matrix [14, 15, 16, 17], and scat-
tering matrix [18] method have been proposed. In these
kinds of methods, a photonic crystal slab is treated as the
stack of many gratings. The matrix problem for only one

2

grating layer is solved ﬁrst, then multiplying the matrices
layer by layer and the total transmittance and reﬂectance
can be determined. Although these methods are success-
ful, however, in order to conﬁrm the good numerical ac-
curacy, the number of layers should be restricted to a
small value. In addition, using these methods it is hard
to ﬁnd the relations between the transmittance and the
original band structure.

In this paper, we propose an alternative method to
calculate the transmitted and reﬂected waves from the
interface between vacuum and a semi-inﬁnite photonic
crystal for a incident plane wave. The method is based
on Eq. (4), which contains all the information of the band
structure of the system. We thus can easily analyze the
physical meanings of various phenomena using the knowl-
edge getting from the solid state physics.

Here, if the kx and ky are ﬁxed, the frequency ω can
be solved as an eigenvalue problem. If the system is in-
ﬁnitely extended, there are just only propagation modes
that can survive. However, sometimes we have to calcu-
late the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients for a ﬁ-
nite sized or semi-inﬁnite sample, which have at least one
boundary. At the edges of the sample, the periodic struc-
ture is broken and the evanescent modes must be consid-
ered. However, it is impossible to obtain the evanescent
solutions from the eigenvalue problem of Eq. (4) because
it provides the solutions for an extended bulk and the
boundary conditions at inﬁnite restrict the kx and ky to
be taken as real values.

Nevertheless, can we make some modiﬁcations to pro-
duce the attenuated solutions of Eq. (4)? The answer is
yes. For diﬀerent purposes, there are two kinds of calcu-
lations: one is to ﬁx the direction of k and frequency; the
other is to ﬁx ky and frequency. With a simple transfor-
mation, the Eq. (4) can be rewritten as

face. From which we can easily determine the penetra-

from this calculation will tell us how to cut the sample
to get the highest performance.

On the other hand, Eq. (6) can be used to deal with the
problem for light incident with diﬀerent angle θ, which is
the angle between the normal vector of the interface and

if so, the Eq. (8) has nonezero solutions when there is
no incident light. This kind of wave is a surface state
which resembles the surface plasmon propagating along
the surface of a metal. However, we do not discuss it
in this paper. One more interesting thing among these
three equations — from Eq.(4) to Eq.(6) — is that they
are identical to each other. Because the second row of
matrices of left side of Eq. (5) and Eq. (6) are equal
to Eq. (4) while the
in these equations are equal.
Thus any eigenfunction of one of these three equations
satisﬁes another two equations.

band edge to obtain the band structure from Eq. (4) if
we hope to observe what happened near the band gap.
By replacing the frequencies of Eq. (5) and (6) by ω0,
the penetration depth can be derived from Eq. (5) and
so do the variations of transmittance while the solutions
of Eq. (6) are used in Eq. (7). During this process, even

in Fig. 4 we employ vacuum cylinders each with radius
0.43077a inside the PbO(ǫ = 2.72 ) background. In all
cases, a is the lattice constant and the primitive vectors
are given by a1 = (a, 0) and a2 = (0, a).

The ﬁrst application is a selection rule to determine the
interface direction for the highest performance of light
insulation. We solve Eq. (5) at a frequency equal to
0.4(2πc/a) and the results are presented in Fig. 3.
In
Fig. 2, there is a band gap at ω = 0.4(2πc/a) for the TE
mode, so that in Fig. 3(c), there are no real number so-
lutions inside the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. However, outside
and far away from the 1st Brillouin zone such solutions
exist, which are fake and are caused by the ﬁnite basis
used in the calculations. To ﬁnd the interface direction
we ﬁrst choose a direction ˆk and use Eq. (5) to ﬁnd a
k that has the smallest
value, which denoted as
Im(k)

|
kI (θ) and determines the main decay trend for a wave
propagating along ˆk. The second step is to scan angles
from 0◦ to 45◦ to ﬁnd an angle θ0 that has the maxi-
mum kI (θ). The details are shown in Fig. 3(d), where
we calculate the TE modes, and the penetration depths
(i.e., 2π/kI (θ)) for 0◦ and 45◦ are 6.8540a and 3.3272a,
respectively. This indicates that when we produce a sam-
ple that cut along 45◦, it just needs 4 or 5 layers to stop
the light with ω = 0.4(2πc/a) for TE modes instead of 7
or 8 layers for 0◦.

The second application is to ﬁx ky and frequency in
order to obtain kx. For comparison, we select the system
discussed in [9] to contrast with our system and show the
result in Fig. 4. The system in [9] is a 16 layers photonic
crystal which is a square lattice (with a lattice constant

a) of air columns (radius equals 0.43077a and is located
at the center of a unit cell) in a dielectric substrate PbO
placed in air and our system is a semi-inﬁnite photonic
crystal placed in air. By using Eq. (6) and Eq. (8) the
transmittance can be obtained as shown in Fig. 4. Be-
cause our system is inﬁnite, we can ﬁnd something quite
diﬀerent.

(1) The solid lines and dashed lines are almost smooth
curves except in the gap regime and at some special
points (ω = 0.74 and 0.85 in TE mode). The oscillat-

that of [9]. The oscillation behavior is owing to ﬁnite
thickness. They can be easily explained by a roughly
consideration of the average dielectric ¯ǫ
icell. For
low frequency, the most important contribution of ǫG is
ǫG=0, which is equal to ¯ǫ, therefore the 16 layers photonic
crystals can be considered as an eﬀective material with
uniform dielectric ¯ǫ = 1.7173ǫ0 and width 16a, where a
is the lattice constant of the photonic crystal and ǫ0 is
the permittivity of free space. This is a typical 1D prob-
lem and the waves in both sides of this material can be
connected by transfer matrix whose formula is

size.

(2) In the vicinity of ˜ω

0.74, according to the band
structure calculation results the spectrum should ascend
rapidly when ˜ω is increasing, because it is at band edge.
But, the real situation appears in Fig. 4(a) is ascending
quickly and descending immediately to near zero trans-
mittance. Our explanation is that there are two propa-
0, so they do not
gation mode’s with group velocity vg ≃
contribute to the transmittance.

(3) In Fig. 4(a), the valley of transmittance near
ω = 0.85 disappears when the interface is chosen to pass
through the center of the vacuum cylinders. This re-
veals that it is possible to stop the light at some isolated
frequency points by appropriately choosing the cutting
plane of the photonic crystal even if the frequencies are
outside of band gaps.

tion such like for how large a separation distance between
two defects can they be treated as independent in super-
cell method.

In conclusion, the method we present here may not be
eﬃcient enough, because in the calculation we get results
both inside and outside of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (FBZ).
However, only the results inside the FBZ are useful and
the others repeat the same information and are redun-
dant. For example, if we use N 2 bases, there are only
2N useful eigenfunctions. Besides, this method has sev-
eral advantages. First, from this method we can easily
realize and analyze some properties of periodic systems
with interface and the computational time is independent
of the number of layers. Thus, even if the number of lay-
ers is very large, it will save much time. Second, using
Eq. (9), we can also calculate the density of states, D(ω),
through

this result. According our calculation the wave attenua-
tion rate for a 16-layer structure is about 0.0733, which
agrees with the result shown by the line with dots. This
phenomenon shows that the evanescent modes do con-
tribute the transmittance in a ﬁnite thickness structure.
In these two applications, the evanescent modes are
necessary and useful for the calculations of semi-inﬁnite
system, and this method also provides us some informa-

They are especially useful when we aim to calculate the
density of states in some small frequency regimes.

We are now investigating the cases of ﬁnite size speci-

mens and a structure with line defects.

Finally, we thank Prof. B. Y. Gu for instructing us
about Andreev reﬂection, which gave us a chance to em-
ploy this idea about Eq. (5), and thank Dr. P. G. Luan
who let us ﬁnd more possibilities with this method.

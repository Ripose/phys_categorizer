Abstract

This work is based upon a coupled, atomically-based continuum formu-
lation that was previously applied to problems involving strong coupling
between mechanics and mass transport; e.g. diﬀusional creep and electro-
migration [1, 2]. Here we discuss an enhancement of this formulation to
account for migrating grain boundaries. The treatment is based on the
level set method and can easily be generalized to model other problems
with migrating interfaces; e.g. void evolution and free-surface morphology
evolution. The level-set formulation developed is remarkably simple and
obviates the need for spatial stabilization. It also makes use of velocity
extension, ﬁeld re-initialization and least-squares smoothing techniques.
The latter allow the local curvature of a grain boundary to be computed
directly from the level-set ﬁeld without resorting to higher-order inter-
polation. A notable feature is that the coupling between mass transport,
mechanics and grain-boundary migration is fully accounted for. The com-
plexities associated with this coupling are highlighted and the operator-
split algorithm used to solve the coupled equations is described.

Key words: Grain-boundary migration, level set method, self-diﬀusion.

1 Introduction

In a recent paper, Garikipati et al. [1] presented a coupled continuum ﬁeld for-
mulation for the interaction of self-diﬀusion, mechanics and electromigration in
polycrystalline solids. Computational techniques were developed based upon
the ﬁnite element method. Their approach drew upon earlier work by Larch´e

and Cahn [3, 4], Nix and Co-workers [5, 6], G´enin [7], Bower and Freund [8],
Xia et al. [9]—to name but a few. A review of these and other works appeared
in [1]. Several initial- and boundary-value problems, involving diﬀusional creep
(Nabarro-Herring and Coble creep), were solved. The formulation was extended
to interdiﬀusion, with dopants in silicon as motivation, by Garikipati and Bass-
man [2]. In the current paper, we present a further extension of this formulation
to self-diﬀusion in the presence of migrating grain boundaries.

Diﬀerent strategies have been used to model grain-boundary motion in a com-
putational setting. Sun and Suo [10, 11] developed a two-dimensional ﬁnite
element formulation, based on the idea that the energy dissipated during the
motion of the boundary must equal the reduction in the free energy of the
system. This formulation was used to study several problems including grain
growth in a thin ﬁlm and the competition between surface grooving and grain-
boundary migration. A similar variational formulation was developed by Cocks
and Gill [12, 13] and used to model the evolution of a large network of grains in
two dimensions. Another model was developed by Zhao et al. [14], based on the
variational formulation of Reitich and Soner [15] and using the level set method
of Osher and Sethian [16], which is also used in the current paper.

The goal of the current work is not merely to simulate grain-boundary motion,
but to capture fully the interaction between this motion and other microscale
phenomena that take place in pure polycrystalline materials, namely stress-
mediated self-diﬀusion and electromigration. In Section 2, we summarize the
formulation for coupled mass transport and mechanics. Then we examine the
thermodynamics and kinetics of grain-boundary migration, and show how this
phenomenon interacts with mass transport and mechanics in polycrystals. In
Section 3, we formulate the grain-boundary migration problem using the level set
method and we describe the computational methods used in the implementation
of this formulation. Numerical examples are presented in Section 4. A summary
is provided and conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

2 The coupled formulation

2.1 Thermodynamic basis

The thermodynamics is posed in a continuum setting, with motivation provided
by atomic processes. A schematic of the lattice is shown in Fig. 1. It shows
atoms, vacancies, and a free surface; the latter is a source and sink for vacancies.
A grain boundary could serve as a source or sink also. Free surfaces and grain
boundaries are treated as regions of ﬁnite width, δs and 2δgb respectively.

2.1.1 Internal energy density

We consider crystalline materials in which the dangling bonds around a vacancy
cause an inward relaxation of the surrounding lattice (see Fig. 1). The resulting

vacancy relaxation strain can be expressed as

εv = −

(1 − f )Ω(Cv − Ceq

v0 )1,

1
3

where Ω is the atomic volume, f Ω (with 0 < f < 1) is the volume of a vacancy,
Cv is the vacancy concentration, Ceq
v0 is the vacancy concentration at thermo-
dynamic equilibrium under vanishing external stress and 1 is the second-order
isotropic tensor. The creep strain resulting from the accumulation or deple-
tion of atoms at a free surface or grain boundary with unit normal, n, can be
expressed as

A non-phenomenological evolution equation for θc was derived and discussed in
detail by Garikipati et al. [1]. The thermal strain is given by

εc =

θc(n ⊗ n).

1
3

εth = α(T − T0)1,

where T is the temperature, T0 is a reference temperature and α is the linear
coeﬃcient of thermal expansion. The elastic strain is obtained by subtracting
these inelastic strain contributions from the total strain, ε; i.e.

εe = ε − (εv + εc + εth).

The stress is obtained from the elastic strain and the (generally anisotropic)
fourth-order elasticity tensor, C, as

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

Given a state with local stress, σ, the incremental elastic strain energy density is
then given as σ : δεe = (C : εe) : δεe, where δεe is the increment in elastic strain.

σ = C : εe.

3

With this background, the incremental internal energy density δe, corresponding
to a state {ε, T, Cv}, and increments δε and δCv is

δe = δˆeη(η) + ef

v δCv + (C : εe) : δεe,

(6)

where η is the entropy density and ef
v is the vacancy formation energy. The
speciﬁc form of ˆeη(η), the entropic dependence of e, is not important to the
development that follows.

2.1.2 External work density

The density of work done by external agents can be expressed as

δwext = σ : δε − qψδCv +

(n · σn)f ΩδCvχ.

(7)

2

Here, the ﬁrst term of the right-hand side is the classical stress-power term.
The second term accounts for the apparent work performed by the electrostatic
potential, ψ, during electromigration; in this phenomenological treatment, q is
the apparent charge ascribed to each vacancy. The last term accounts for the
work done against the stress when vacancies are created at a free surface or grain
boundary. The numerical factor appearing in this term arises from geometrical
considerations. Additionally, the requirement that this term be active only at
sources and sinks is enforced using the indicator function, χ, deﬁned as

χ(x, t) =

1
0

(cid:26)

if x is in a surface- or grain-boundary region,
otherwise.

2.1.3 Entropy density

The total entropy density is given by

η = ˆηvib(T ) − k

(cid:18)
Since the formulation is isothermal, the speciﬁc form of the vibrational term,
ˆηvib(T ), is unimportant. The second term is the entropy density due to mixing
(see Kittel and Kroemer [17] for details), k is the Boltzmann constant, Ca is the
concentration of atoms, and Cs is the lattice site concentration. Assuming that
Cs remains ﬁxed in any material volume, i.e. δCs = δCa + δCv = 0, the incre-
mental entropy density corresponding to an increment in vacancy concentration,
δCv, at given stress and temperature can be expressed as

δη = −k log

δCv.

2.1.4 The Gibbs free energy density

At the given state of stress and temperature, the incremental Gibbs free energy
density corresponding to increments δε and δCv is deﬁned as

δg = δe − δwext − T δη.

(11)

With this, the constitutive relations can be obtained in a systematic fashion as
outlined in the following section.

Remark 1: Since free surfaces and grain boundaries are considered, there are
accompanying surface and grain boundary energies, γs and γgb. These energies
are taken to be independent of the strain and vacancy concentration for this
formulation, and therefore do not appear in the incremental Gibbs free energy
density.

2.2 Constitutive relations

Anisotropic elasticity is assumed and the relation between the stress, σ, and
the elastic strain, εe, is given by (5). The relation between the current density,
i, and the electric potential, ψ, is given by Ohm’s law:

i = −

∇ψ
ρ

,

(12)

where ρ is the electric resistivity.

2.2.1 The chemical potential of vacancies

The vacancy chemical potential is deﬁned in the usual fashion [18]:
µvδCv = µeq

v δCv + δg,

(13)

where µeq

v is a constant reference potential. Applying (13) to (6–11) gives

µv = µeq

The coupling with mechanics is evident through the strain- and stress-dependent
terms.

2.2.2 The vacancy ﬂux

The vacancy ﬂux is obtained from (14) via the relation

DvCv
kT
where Dv is the vacancy diﬀusivity. This relation has been derived from an
atomic basis by Bardeen [19]. The term DvCv/kT is the mobility of a vacancy
and −∇µv, the force acting on it, is the driving force for mass transport.

2.3 Governing equations

The constitutive relations established above are incorporated in balance laws
for mechanics, electric ﬂow and mass transport, leading to a coupled system of
governing diﬀerential equations.

2.3.1 Mechanics

Neglecting dynamic eﬀects and body forces, the mechanics problem is governed
by the quasistatic equilibrium equation and appropriate boundary conditions:

∇ · σ = 0,
u = u,
σn = t,

in B,
on ∂Bu,
on ∂Bσ,

(16b)
(16c)
where B is the domain of interest and the boundary subsets ∂Bu and ∂Bσ
have essential and natural boundary conditions speciﬁed, respectively. These
subsets satisfy ∂Bu ∩ ∂Bσ = ∅ and ∂Bu ∪ ∂Bσ = ∂B.

2.3.2 Electric ﬂow

The electric ﬂow problem is governed by the charge conservation equation with
Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions:

∇ · i = 0,

ψ = ψ,
i · n = ı,

in B,
on ∂Bψ,
on ∂Bi,

where ∂Bψ ∩ ∂Bi = ∅ and ∂Bψ ∪ ∂Bi = ∂B.

2.3.3 Mass Transport

The mass-transport problem is governed by the continuity equation for vacan-
cies, and appropriate initial and boundary conditions:

(18d)
where ∂BCv and ∂Bjv are the boundary subsets on which concentration and
ﬂux boundary conditions are speciﬁed, respectively. Here, the boundary subsets
satisfy ∂BCv ∩∂Bj v = ∅ and ∂BCv ∪ ∂Bjv = ∂B. The eﬀectiveness of vacancy
sources and sinks is characterized by the relaxation time, τ . The equilibrium
vacancy concentration, Ceq

2.4 Grain-boundary migration

The current location of a migrating grain boundary determines the value of
the indicator function, χ(x, t) [see Eq. (8)]; i.e. it determines whether vacancy
sources/sinks are active and whether creep strain can accumulate at a given
point, x ∈ B. Furthermore, information about the location of the boundary
is needed to calculate the value of the vacancy formation energy, ef
v , and the
activation energy for diﬀusion, ed
v, everywhere in the domain of interest. These
properties are assumed to vary linearly over the width of a boundary region as
shown in Fig. 2.

The foregoing illustrates the inﬂuence of grain-boundary migration on mass
transport. Due to the tight coupling between mass transport and mechanics,
the migration of the grain boundary also aﬀects the stress. In turn, mass transfer
across the grain boundary causes one grain to grow at the expense of its neighbor
and thus leads to grain-boundary migration.

2.4.1 Thermodynamic driving forces

Generally, interface migration in polycrystals is driven by the accompanying
decrease in the free energy of the system. The thermodynamic driving force for

7

such a process, acting on a unit area of the interface, is thus deﬁned as

p = −

δG
δV

,

(19)

(20)

where δG is the increase in the total Gibbs free energy of the system brought
about by a motion of the interface, during which the interface sweeps through the
volume δV . Neglecting triple junctions, the Gibbs free energy of a polycrystal
can be expressed as the sum of two contributions:

G =

g dV +

γi dS,

ZB

i ZΓi

X

where g is the Gibbs free energy density as deﬁned in (11) and γi is the energy
per unit area of an interface, Γi. The term “interface” is used here to refer to
free surfaces as well as grain boundaries, and the summation in (20) is over all
such interfaces in the polycrystal.

In situations where the Gibbs free energy density, g, suﬀers a decrease across a
grain boundary, the total free energy of the system can be reduced if the grain
with the smaller value of g (evaluated at the grain boundary) were to grow at the
expense of its neighbor. Thus, a driving force acts on the grain boundary. For
example, during recrystallization, annealed grains grow at the expense of cold-
worked grains in which large dislocation densities lead to high values of g. The
misorientation between two adjacent grains of an elastically anisotropic material
subjected to a directional load causes one grain to store a smaller amount of
strain energy per unit volume than its neighbor. This leads to strain-induced
grain-boundary migration. Electromigration also causes atoms to jump across
grain boundaries and thus leads to the migration of these boundaries [20].

Under the current formulation, the driving force discussed above can be char-
acterized as follows: When a single atom hops across the grain boundary, it
exchanges positions with a vacancy. Therefore, the volume change associated
with this hopping event is δV = (1 − f )Ω. The decrease in the Gibbs free en-
ergy of the system is equal to the diﬀerence in the chemical potential of atoms
across the boundary; i.e. −δG = ∆µa, or equivalently −δG = −∆µv. Hence,
from Eq. (19), and assuming that the chemical potential gradient across the
boundary is essentially linear [21], the driving force, pg, can be expressed as

pg =

−∆µv
(1 − f )Ω

≈

(−∇µv · n)2δgb
(1 − f )Ω

,

(21)

where n is the unit normal to the grain boundary and 2δgb is its width.

From Eq. (20), it is clear that the total Gibbs free energy of a polycrystal can
also be lowered by decreasing the total surface area of the grain boundaries in
the system. When a curved interface moves away from its center of curvature,

increases by

(cid:18)

δV,

(22)

(23)

where γi is the (constant) speciﬁc surface energy of the interface and R1 and
R2 are its principal radii of curvature. This expression can be traced back to
Herring [22]. It follows that, in the current two-dimensional formulation, the
driving force acting on a unit area of a (cylindrical) grain boundary, due to this
eﬀect, can be expressed as

pγ = −

γgb
R

,

where R is the radius of curvature and the negative sign indicates that pγ
drives the boundary to migrate toward its center of curvature (see Fig. 3). In
a polycrystal comprising only annealed grains, the action of pγ leads to normal
grain growth; i.e. the growth of large grains at the expense of smaller ones. By
contrast, in the early stages of recrystallization, small annealed grains grow at
the expense of the surrounding matrix of cold-worked material. In this case, the
boundaries surrounding the annealed grains move away from their respective
centers of curvature under the eﬀect of pg.

2.4.2 Kinetic law

Assuming that grain-boundary migration takes place as a result of individual
atoms hopping across the boundary, the migration velocity can be expressed in
the following form:

vn = M p,

(24)

9

where vn is in the direction of the local unit normal, n, which is assumed to point
away from the boundary’s center of curvature and M is the grain-boundary mo-
bility. This classical result, derived by Turnbull [21] using absolute reaction rate
theory, holds provided that pΩ ≪ kT , a condition which is always met in grain
growth and recrystallization [23]. The results of molecular dynamics simula-
tions of curvature-driven [24] and strain-induced [25] grain-boundary migration
in bicrystals agree with Eq. (24), which can be modiﬁed as follows, to account
for both types of driving forces discussed in Section 2.4.1:

vn = Mgpg + Mγpγ.

(25)

2.4.3 Grain-boundary mobility

In Section 2.4.1, it was established that diﬀusion of atoms across a grain bound-
ary due to the local gradient in the atomic chemical potential causes the bound-
ary to migrate. The driving force for boundary migration in this case, denoted
pg, is given by (21). An expression for the corresponding mobility, Mg, can be
obtained by stipulating that, in this case, the migration velocity in the direction
of the local unit normal, n, should be given by (see Porter and Easterling [26])

Mgpg = − (ja · n) Ω − (j v · n) f Ω,

where ja and j v are, respectively, the local atomic and vacancy ﬂuxes. Also
recall that Ω is the atomic volume and f Ω is the volume of a vacancy. Since
atoms and vacancies move by exchanging positions; i.e. jv = −ja, we have

Finally, by combining (27), (21) and (15), we obtain

Mgpg = (jv · n) (1 − f )Ω.

Mg =

DvCv(1 − f )2Ω2
2δgbkT

.

Since grain-boundary migration under the sole inﬂuence of pg involves transport
across the boundary, and since, in the present treatment, mass transport is
assumed to take place through the exchange of positions between atoms and
vacancies, no lattice sites are transferred across the boundary in this process.
By contrast, migration under the inﬂuence of pγ consists of the transfer of lattice
sites across the grain boundary [23], via the process of atoms detaching from
one grain and attaching to the one on the opposite side of the boundary. It is
hence unreasonable to expect the mobilities, Mg and Mγ, of these two distinctly
diﬀerent processes to be the same.

As mentioned earlier, normal grain growth can be attributed to the action of
the driving force pγ. The fact that grain growth is a thermally activated pro-
cess suggests an Arrhenius-type relationship between the mobility, Mγ, and the
temperature:

Finally, by combining (23), (25), (27) and (29), we obtain the following expres-

3 Computational methods

In this section, we focus on the level-set formulation of the grain-boundary
migration problem, and we present a detailed description of the computational
techniques used in its implementation. The computational framework used to
solve the coupled problem is based on an operator-split solution scheme and
relies on the ﬁnite element method to solve the mechanics, mass-transport and
electric-ﬂow problems individually. To show how the level-set formulation is
integrated into this framework, the operator-split scheme is outlined brieﬂy in
Section 3.2. A detailed description of the entire computational framework can
be found elsewhere [1, 29].

3.1 Level-set formulation

Evolving interfaces can be tracked using the level set method, originally intro-
duced by Osher and Sethian [16]. A comprehensive review of the method and the
computational algorithms used in its implementation can be found in [30, 31].

Consider an evolving grain boundary, Γ, which divides the domain of interest,
B, into two disjoint open subsets, B− and B+. This situation is depicted in

11

Fig. 4. The boundary can be parameterized with the aid of the scalar function
φ(x, t), deﬁned on B, provided that the following conditions are satisﬁed for
all t ≥ 0:

φ(x, t) < 0,
φ(x, t) = 0,

φ(x, t) > 0,

∀ x ∈ B−,
∀ x ∈ Γ,
∀ x ∈ B+.

The term level set refers to a set of points with a ﬁxed value of φ, i.e. a contour
of φ; the zero level set represents the grain boundary. Accordingly, the unit
normal to a given level set can be deﬁned locally as

where k • k denotes the Euclidean norm. This expression can be evaluated at
any point on the zero level set to obtain the local unit normal to the boundary,

The evolution of the level-set ﬁeld is governed by

n+ =

∇φ
k∇φk

,

∂φ
∂t

+ Fn k∇φk = 0,

where Fn(x, t) is the (scalar) local propagation velocity of the level set passing
through point x. To track the motion of the grain boundary, we require that

Fn(x, t) = vn(x, t),

∀ x ∈ Γ, t ≥ 0,

(34)

where vn is obtained at any point on the grain boundary from (30). Although
this requirement does not place any restrictions on the choice of Fn away from
Γ, the solution procedure is simpliﬁed greatly if Fn is an extensional velocity
ﬁeld; i.e. if

∇Fn · n+ = 0.

This ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equation can be solved for Fn, at all points
x ∈ (B \ Γ), using (34) as a boundary condition. A simpler alternative strategy
for constructing the extensional ﬁeld is discussed in Section 3.1.1 below.

The level-set function, φ, can be initialized as the signed distance from Γ as
follows:

φ(x, 0) =

kx − yk

min
y∈Γ

sign[(x − y) · n+

0 (y)].

(cid:19)
It is noted that this initial condition satisﬁes (31). It also implies that initially,

(cid:18)

k∇φk = 1,

∀x ∈ B.

Importantly, this desirable mathematical property of the level-set ﬁeld is pre-
served when the velocity ﬁeld is extensional. This can be shown (see [14]) by

k∇φk2 =

(∇φ · ∇φ)

∂

∇φ.

Combining (38) and (33) and assuming that φ and Fn are smooth, we obtain

∂
∂t

k∇φk2 = −2∇φ · ∇Fnk∇φk − 2∇φ · ∇k∇φkFn.

(39)

Thus, if Fn is extensional (i.e. ∇φ·∇Fn = 0) and φ is initially a signed-distance
function (i.e. k∇φk = 1 and ∇k∇φk = 0), we have

which implies that (37) holds for all t ≥ 0. Hence, Eq. (33) reduces to

(41)

∂

k∇φk = 0,

+ Fn = 0,

which governs the evolution of φ(x, t) from the initial condition (36).

Recall that the mechanics, mass-transport and electric-ﬂow problems are solved
using the ﬁnite element method, and that part of the coupling between these
three sub-problems, on one hand, and the grain-boundary migration sub-problem,
on the other, is through the indicator function, χ(x, t). In this setting, the level-
set update is computed at each node via a generalized trapezoidal rule:

φ(xA, tn+1) = φ(xA, tn) − ∆t Fn(xA, tn+a),

(42)

where xA is the position vector of node A and tn+a = atn+1 + (1 − a)tn, with
0 ≤ a ≤ 1.
It is noted that when explicit time integration is used (a = 0),
the update operation is trivial since vn, and hence Fn, are determined from the
known solution at t = tn and do not depend on φ(x, tn+1).

Additionally, χ is deﬁned more precisely as follows:

χ(x, t) = H(δgb − |φ(x, t)|),

(43)

where H(•) is the Heaviside unit step function.

3.1.1 Velocity projection and ﬁeld re-initialization

The approach adopted here for constructing the extensional level-set propaga-
tion velocity ﬁeld, Fn, is based on the notion that Fn(x) = vn(y) for any x /∈ Γ,
if y is such that

kx − yk = min
y∈Γ

kx − yk.

Due to the accumulation of numerical error, the level-set ﬁeld may develop per-
turbations; i.e. k∇φk may deviate from unity in some regions within B. The
ﬁeld must be re-initialized to neutralize these perturbations and retain accu-
racy by maintaining k∇φk = 1 [see Eqs. (38–40)]. Box 1 shows the algorithm
used to implement the velocity projection scheme outlined above and the re-
initialization scheme based on Eq. (36). It is obvious that the re-initialization
operation consists of one trivial assignment operation per node and thus incurs
almost no additional computational cost. It can therefore be performed in every
time step. It must be noted that, to preserve the integrity of the solution, the
re-initialization procedure must not change the current location of Γ. In other
words, the re-initialized ﬁeld must have the same zero level set as the original
(perturbed) ﬁeld. This can be achieved by leaving the value of φ unchanged at
nodes lying within a narrow band surrounding Γ; e.g. by setting tolerance = 2h
in Box 1, where h is the mesh parameter. An elegant alternative re-initialization
procedure is described in detail in [35, 36].

the global arrays, Φ, F and D hold the nodal values of φ, Fn and kx − yk,
respectively. A division of the zero level set which spans a single element is
referred to as a “segment” and is denoted by L0. Also, since bilinear shape
functions are used, an element can contain only one such segment.

3.1.2 Gradient smoothing

The local migration velocity, vn, on the grain boundary is dependent on the
local curvature, κ = 1/R, which is deﬁned as follows:

From (32) and (37), it is clear that n+ = ∇φ, and the curvature can hence be
expressed as

(47)

(48)

where nsd = 2 is the number of spatial dimensions. Since the value of φ is
updated at the ﬁnite element nodes, it is convenient to use the shape functions to
evaluate the spatial derivatives in the above expression. However, since bilinear
shape functions are used for simplicity and robustness, the obtained curvature

κ = ∇ · n+.

introduce a ‘smoothed’ normal vector ﬁeld ˜n+, weakly related to ∇φ by

where w is an arbitrary weighting function. Equivalently, the nodal values

the corresponding element arrays via the usual assembly process. The element

3.2 Operator-split algorithm

The coupled problem is solved using an operator-split algorithm. The sequence
of operations carried out in one time step is shown in Box 2 to illustrate how the
level-set formulation is incorporated into this solution scheme. Details regarding
the advantages, applications and numerical stability characteristics of operator-
split schemes can be found in [38, 39, 40] and references therein.

4 Numerical examples

Numerical results, obtained by solving the coupled initial and boundary value
problem, are presented here with the aim of highlighting some of the advantages
of the current approach. A 1 µm wide, 2.5 µm long segment of an aluminum
interconnect line is modeled. The values of the material parameters used for Al
are given in Table 1. The segment consists of two pure Al crystals separated by
a Σ7 tilt grain boundary (38.2◦ misorientation about <111>).

The line is assumed to operate at T = 373 K, with a reference temperature,
T0 = 473 K. Rigid passivation material surrounding the line prevents vacancies
from crossing the upper and lower boundaries of the domain (see Fig. 6a); i.e.
the condition jv ·n = 0 holds at these boundaries. Periodic boundary conditions
are imposed on the vacancy concentration at the left and right boundaries of
the segment and an electrostatic potential diﬀerence, ∆ψ = 0.0021 V, is applied
between these two extremities. Vacancies drift along the electric ﬁeld, E =
−∇ψ, pointing to the right.

In the ﬁrst example, the migrating grain boundary consists, initially, of two
straight (planar) sections, which are joined by a circular (cylindrical) section.
The straight sections form 45◦ angles with the upper and lower boundaries
of the domain as shown in Fig. 6a. Since the vacancy formation energy, ef
v ,
is low inside grain-boundary regions where vacancy sources are also present,
vacancies accumulate in such regions resulting in high values of the local vacancy
concentration, Cv. The location of the grain boundary is revealed locally by the
maximum-valued contour of Cv.

Figure 6 shows the evolution of the vacancy concentration contours in the line.
It is clear that, during the ﬁrst 300 seconds, the central cylindrical section of

the boundary migrates to the right; i.e. toward its center of curvature, while
the planar sections are relatively less mobile (Fig. 6b). It must be emphasized
that the interaction between mechanics, mass transport, electric eﬀects and
grain-boundary motion is accounted for, and the driving force for boundary
migration, due to stress-driven diﬀusion and electromigration, is included in the
calculations. However, its eﬀect is overshadowed by the dominant driving force
due to the curvature of the boundary.

After 900 seconds, the curvature is approximately the same everywhere on the
grain boundary (Fig. 6c). At this stage, a steady state prevails and the boundary
continues to travel toward the right without undergoing any further changes in
shape. It is noted that the level set calculations remain stable. The boundary
remains smooth and does not develop any spurious cusps or ripples. The 45◦
equilibrium angles between the grain boundary and the sidewalls are maintained
as the solution progresses.

A vector plot of the vacancy ﬂux ﬁeld at t = 300 sec and a corresponding
contour plot of the magnitude of the vacancy ﬂux are shown in Figs. 7 and 8,
respectively. It is clear that a strong vacancy ﬂux exists in the neighborhood
of the boundary and, although the ﬁeld is complicated in this neighborhood, it
can be seen that vacancies tend to drift in the same direction as the migrating

boundary, thus preventing the appearance of a “trail” of vacancies or other
oscillations in the numerical solution in the boundary’s wake. It is important to
note that the ﬂux ﬁeld evolves continually as the boundary migrates. It is also
notable that the formulation captured this aspect of the coupling between mass
transport and grain-boundary migration without additional terms being added
to the expression of the vacancy ﬂux to account, speciﬁcally, for the eﬀect of
moving boundaries.

The second example is concerned with the case where a curved grain boundary
evolves into a planar conﬁguration to reduce the free energy of the system. Here,
the equilibrium angles at the grain boundary-sidewall intersections are set to
90◦ and the initial geometry of the boundary is diﬀerent and less regular than
in the ﬁrst example. It is clear from Fig. 9, which shows the evolution of the
vacancy concentration contours in this case, that the boundary ﬂattens as the
solution progresses. It is noted that the equilibrium angles are also preserved

Although the numerical stability characteristics of the level-set formulation—
and those of the operator-split algorithm—are not examined in a formal setting,
no spatial or temporal oscillations are observed in the numerical solution of the
example problems presented, as long as the time-step size is within the CFL
limit; i.e. ∆t < h/Fn, where h is the mesh parameter. Moreover, numerical
experiments suggest that oscillation-free results can be obtained in some cases
where the migrating interface develops sharp corners, without adding a shock-
capturing operator such as the one described in [41, 42, 43]. Such stability-
related issues will be examined in a forthcoming paper.

5 Summary

The coupled continuum formulation presented here was developed to model
stress-driven self-diﬀusion and electromigration in polycrystals while account-
ing fully for the interaction between these mass transfer processes and the mo-
tion of grain boundaries. The formulation accounts for two distinct thermody-
namic driving forces acting on a grain boundary; one due to the boundary’s
own curvature and another engendered by mass transfer across the boundary
via stress-driven self-diﬀusion and electromigration.

The level set method is used to pose grain-boundary migration as a time-
dependent ﬁeld problem governed by a pure advection equation. Instead of re-
sorting to widely used spatial stabilization techniques (e.g. upwinding schemes,
Galerkin/Least-Squares) to attenuate the spurious oscillations known to appear
in the numerical solution of equations of this type, the level-set equation is re-
duced to an ordinary diﬀerential equation using the mathematical properties
of signed distance functions and extensional velocity ﬁelds. The use of an ex-
plicit time-integration scheme also eliminates the need for an iterative solution
method. Thus, advancing the solution in time is achieved by updating the value
of the level-set function at each nodal point separately. The algorithm used to
construct the extensional velocity ﬁeld—and to re-initialize the level-set ﬁeld
simultaneously for increased eﬃciency—is also presented. Furthermore, a least-
squares projection technique is used to allow the local curvature of the grain
boundary to be calculated directly from the level-set ﬁeld without resorting to
higher-order interpolation. A detailed description of this least-squares smooth-
ing technique, which is analogous to stress-recovery methods, is provided.

The numerical examples presented indicate that the strong coupling in the prob-
lem is captured adequately and that the numerical implementation allows the
solution of the coupled initial- and boundary-value problem to be advanced in
time in a stable fashion to obtain physically meaningful results.

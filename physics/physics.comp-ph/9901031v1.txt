Abstract

A computer adapted ﬂuctuation formula for the calculation of the wavevec-

tor- and frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity for interaction site mod-

els of polar ﬂuids within the Ewald summation technique is proposed and

applied to molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P water. The formula

is analyzed and optimal parameters of the Ewald method are identiﬁed. A

comparison of the obtained results with those evaluated within the reaction

ﬁeld approach is made.

1 Motivation

In order to achieve a macroscopic behaviour for investigated quantities in com-

puter experiment based on the observation of ﬁnite systems, it is necessary to reduce

the inﬂuence of surface eﬀects to a minimum. This is especially important for polar

systems with the long-range nature of interactions. Excluding the surface eﬀects in

simulations can be performed within either the reaction ﬁeld (RF) [1–5] or Ewald

summation [6–10] techniques. Now an equivalence between these techniques has

been established for models of point dipoles and proper calculations can be made

within either method [11, 12]. The explicit consideration of a ﬁnite-size medium

lead to computer adapted ﬂuctuation formulas [11–17] which allow one to calculate

boundary free values for the dielectric constant on the basis of dipole moment ﬂuc-

tuations obtained in simulations. These formulas diﬀer considerably with respect to

those known from the theory of macroscopic systems even if the Ewald method is

used [11]. Details of the summation must be taken into account explicitly in order

to obtain correct values for the bulk dielectric constant.

Previously [18–20], the standard RF of point dipoles (PDRF) [3] has been applied

to investigate more realistic, interaction site models (ISMs) [21] of polar ﬂuids.

The PDRF, however, being exact for point dipole models, may not be necessarily

applicably to interpret simulation results for arbitrary systems [5]. Recently, it has

been shown by actual calculations for a MCY water model that uncertainties for the

dielectric quantities are signiﬁcant if the PDRF is used in computer simulations of

ISMs and an alternative scheme, the interaction site reaction ﬁeld (ISRF) geometry,

has been proposed [22]. At the same time, there is not such an approach concerning

the entire wavevector and frequency dependence for the dielectric permittivity of

ISMs within the Ewald geometry. The main attention of previous simulations [23–

31] was directed to study the dielectric properties in the static limit or at zero

and small wavevector values. Moreover, the macroscopic ﬂuctuation formulas have

been used in the simulation results without taking into account details of the Ewald

summation.

In the present paper we apply the Ewald technique for treating Coulomb inter-

actions in ISMs. The paper is organized as follows. A ﬂuctuation formula suitable

2

for the calculation of the wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric constant

is derived in Sec. 2 and optimal values of the Ewald parameters are determined

there. The results of molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P water for time

correlation functions related to dielectric polarization are presented in Sec. 3. These

results are compared with those computed within the ISRF geometry. Concluding

remarks are given in Sec. 4.

2 Ewald summation for ISMs

Consider a polar ﬂuid with N molecules composed of M interaction sites which

are conﬁned in a volume V . The microscopic electric ﬁeld created by the molecules
at point r and time t can be presented as ˆE(r, t) =

duced exactly in computer experiment which deals with a ﬁnite, as a rule, cubic

volume V = L3, where L is the length of the simulation box edge. However, using

the lattice summation, a macroscopic behaviour can be achieved considering the

interactions between sites within the basic cell as well as an inﬁnite lattice of its

periodic images (the periodic boundary convention). This can be interpreted as

an eﬀective interaction which involves only the sites in the basic cell and charac-
terized by a modiﬁed operator D(ρ) =

n D(ρ + nL), where the summation is

extended over all vectors n with integer components. It is more convenient to rep-

resent the lattice sum in a form, proposed by Ewald and Kornfeld (EK) [6], namely,
D(ρ) = D1(ρ) + D2(ρ), where

(1) and (2) is independent on the parameter η. The main advantage of the EK

representation lies in the fact that values for η can be found in such a way that the

both sums, D1 and D2, converge very quickly and may be truncated after a ﬁnite

number of terms.

If the parameter η is chosen suﬃciently large, we can restrict

ourselves to a single term (

The computer adapted formula (5) reduces to the formula for inﬁnite systems

k = 0 the pattern is diﬀerent because of ﬁniteness of L and D(0) = 0 as in the ISRF

geometry [22]. However, in the case of an actual summation, when kmax takes ﬁnite

values, the factor D(k) can noticeably diﬀer from unity. Therefore, the ﬁnite sample

behaves like a macroscopic system if the function D(k) is very close to unity and

this condition can be veriﬁed now quantitatively. Moreover, this explicit result may

serve as an initial point for a more fruitful discussion about the Ewald method itself.

and kmax. Then an optimal value for η can be determined as that providing a global

minimum for the function ∆(η, kmax) at a given kmax.

According to Eq. (5), the obtained in simulations Kirkwood factor GL diﬀers

from its genuine value gL with the relative precision of χ = 9y∆. The function
χ(η, nmax) is shown in Fig. 1 as depending on η at ﬁxed values of nmax = kmaxL/2π.

It has been calculated for the case of R = L/2 and y = 5.47 that corresponds to

5

the thermodynamics point ρ = mN/V = 1 g/cm3, T = 293 K of the TIP4P model,

where m is the mass of water molecule. As we can see from the ﬁgure, the precision

of calculations of dielectric quantities in computer experiment depends on Ewald

parameters in a characteristic way. We indicate the existence of the sharp minimum

of χ at an arbitrary value of nmax. The curves of Fig. 1 can be useful to estimate

the possibility of a given simulation result to reproduce directly the macroscopic

dielectric behaviour of an IS system in an arbitrary thermodynamics state, because

then the function χ′ = χ y′/y is simply rescaled, using the actual value of y′. From

the last equality it follows that the precision of calculations is better for systems

with lower particle densities N/V , molecular polarities µ and higher temperatures

T . It is obvious also that minimums of the functions ∆ and χ with respect to Ewald

parameters coincide between themselves.

The optimal pairs of values for η and nmax at R = L/2 as well as the cor-

responding values of the functions ∆ and χ are selected in Table 1. Choosing a

criterion χ <
∼

1%, we may ask that the formula for inﬁnite systems might be applied

(at k

= 0) and the inﬂuence of summation details can be neglected in this case for

which GL(k, t) and gL(k, t) are indistinguishable. It can be seen easily from the table
4 satisfy this criterion if the parameter η is chosen optimally.
that values of nmax ≥
The parameters nmax = 5, ηL = 5.76 and R = L/2 are usually exploited in simula-

tions [10]. For these values the relative precision is χ = 0.22%. However, choosing

the optimal value ηL = 5.929 at nmax = 5 instead of ηL = 5.76, we can reduce the

uncertainty up to χ = 0.13%.

In the presented above consideration, the cut-oﬀ radius R has been putted to

be half the basic cell length. Nevertheless, increasing nmax, the same precision of

summation can be achieved also at smaller values of R. Let η and nmax correspond

to the optimal parameters at R = L/2. And now we choose a smaller value of the

cut-oﬀ radius in the form R′ = R/l, where l > 1. Taking into account the fact that

maximum deviations of D(k) from unity are always observed at k = 2π(nmax +1)/L,

it is easy to show that the same value of ∆(η, nmax) can be obtained also at η′ = lη

and n′

max = l(nmax + 1)

1. For example, putting nmax = 5 and ηL = 5.929 at

−

R = L/2, we then obtain for R = L/4 (l = 2) the following results: η′L = 11.858 and

6

n′
max = 11. Choosing smaller values of R can be more convenient if the summation

in k-space takes less computation time in an actual programme than the summation

in real space. Indeed, let t1 and t2 are the computation times in real and k-space
(t1 > t2), respectively, at given values of R and nmax. It is obvious that t1 ∼
t2 ∼
minimizing the total computation time t′ = t′

(nmax + 1)3. Then using new values n′

2 with respect to l, one obtains

1 and R′ = R/l and

max = l(nmax + 1)

R3 and

1 + t′

−

t1/t2. Therefore, in such a way we can provide even a time optimization of

l = 6

the programme without any loss of the precision.

3 Numerical results. Comparing the Ewald and

reaction ﬁeld methods

The study of dielectric properties by computer experiment is still a major chal-

lenge, given that the calculations are very sensitive to long-range interactions and

because the polarization of polar ﬂuids is a collective eﬀect, so that long trajectories

are required in order to obtain adequate statistical accuracy. For this reason, un-

til now, the dynamical polarization of ISMs has been investigated at zero or small

wavevector values only [18, 19, 23, 24, 27, 29, 31]. As far as we know, there are

no computer experiment data on the entire wavevector dependence of dynamical

dielectric quantities for such systems.

Our molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the TIP4P model [32]

in the microcanonical ensemble at a density of ρ = 1 g/cm3 and at a temperature

of T = 293 K. We have performed two runs corresponding the Ewald and ISRF [22]

geometries, respectively. In the both runs N = 256 molecules were considered in the

cubic sample V = L3 to which toroidal boundary conditions were applied (

= 0)

and the interaction cut-oﬀ radius was half the basic cell length, R = L/2 = 9.856˚A.

N

The simulations were started from a well equilibrated conﬁguration for positions

of sites, obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. Initial velocities of molecules were

generated at random with the Maxwell distribution. The equations of motion were

integrated with a time step of ∆t = 2 fs on the basis of a matrix method [33] using

7

the Verlet algorithm in velocity form. The system was allowed to achieve equilibrium

for 50 000 time steps. The equilibrium state was observed during 500 000 ∆t = 1 ns

and each 10th time step was chosen to compute equilibrium averages. Translational

and angular velocities of molecules were slightly rescaled after every 500 time steps

in order to conserve the total energy of the system, so that the relative total energy

ﬂuctuations did not exceed 0.01% over the whole runs.

The dynamical Kirkwood factor was evaluated in the time interval of 1000∆t = 2

ps and in a very large wavenumber region, namely, at k = [0, 1, . . . , 300]kmin, where
kmin = 2π/L = 0.319˚A

. Considering the system during such a rather long period

−1

of time allows us to achieve statistical accuracy for the investigated quantities of

order 1%. The optimal parameters ηL = 5.929 and nmax = 5 have been used

in the Ewald summation of Coulomb forces. The computational times on IBM PC

AT486DX4 100 MHz to evaluate dynamics of the system in our Fortran programmes

were 2.2 s and 1.2 s per step in the cases of Ewald and ISRF geometries, respectively.

In the RF geometry, real particles of the inﬁnite system, which are located outside

therefore, the PDRF potential (11) may aﬀect on a true macroscopic behaviour of

the system considerably. Moreover, the ISRF method has yet a minor advantage

over the PDRF scheme that the potential of interaction (12) is continuous and

continuously diﬀerentiable. It is worth to mention also that in the RF geometry the

dielectric permittivity is computed using the ﬂuctuation formula (5) with the formal

substitution D(k)

The wavevector-dependent static Kirkwood factor, GL(k)

GL(k, 0), and sam-

≡

ples of the normalized dynamical Kirkwood factor, ΦL(k, t) = GL(k, t)/GL(k), cal-

culated in the simulations within the Ewald and ISRF geometries, are shown in

10

6
Figs. 2, 3 by the circles and dashed curve, respectively. Since in the ISRF geometry

the function DRF(k) diﬀers from unity considerably, to evaluate the inﬁnite system

Kirkwood factor gL(k, t) the performance of the self-consistent transformation (5)
is necessary. This result is plotted by the solid curve. At the same time, within

the Ewald geometry the function D(k) is very close to unity at the given optimal

parameters of summation (see Table 1), so that the inﬁnite system Kirkwood factor

is equivalent to that, obtained directly in the simulations, i.e, gL(k, t) = GL(k, t) (ex-
cepting the case k = 0). As we can see from the ﬁgures, the agreement between the

two sets of data for the inﬁnite-system functions, corresponding to the Ewald and

ISRF geometries, is quite good. The slight diﬀerence (within a few per cent) at large

times can be explained by an approximate character of the integration appearing

for the ISRF geometry at performing the inverse Laplace transform of (5).

For the purpose of comparison, the inﬁnite-system Kirkwood factor gL(k) corre-
sponding to the PDRF geometry is also included in the Fig. 2 (the dotted curve).

Deviations of values for gL(k) obtained using the PDRF potential from those eval-
uated in the Ewald and ISRF geometries are of order 20%. They are well exhibited

at intermediate values of wavevectors. Such a situation can be explained by the

fact that the PDRF geometry does not take into account the spatial distribution of

charges within the molecule and, thus, the precision of calculations for wavevector-

dependent dielectric quantities at k

2π/d

can not exceed d/R

4 Conclusion

Explicitly considering details of the Ewald summation to treat Coulomb interac-

tions, the ﬂuctuation formula for the computation of the dielectric permittivity in IS

models of polar ﬂuids has been rigorously derived. Using this formula, it has been

corroborated by actual molecular dynamics calculations that the Ewald and ISRF

methods can be applied with equal successes to investigate the dielectric constant

11

of ISMs in computer experiment. The Ewald geometry, however, at a speciﬁc choice

for parameters of the summation, may reproduce the macroscopic behaviour for

dielectric quantities directly in simulations without any additional transformations.

Since the calculation of the wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric per-

mittivity in simulations for ISMs is practical now in principle, we believe that this

fact will stimulate further research of such systems in theory, computer and pure

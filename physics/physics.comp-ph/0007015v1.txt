A two level sampling method is applied to variational Monte Carlo (VMC) that samples the one
and two body parts of the wave function separately. The method is demonstrated on a single Li2
molecule in free space and 32 H2 molecules in a periodic box. This simple modiﬁcation increases
the eﬃciency of a VMC simulation by up to 72%.

Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) [1]

is an eﬀective
method for computing the ground state properties of
atoms, [2, 3] molecules, [4, 5] and solids. [6, 7, 8, 9] Ex-
plicitly including the electron correlation into the wave
function allows VMC to recover a large percentage of the
correlation energy, typically 70-90% (or more for small
atoms and molecules). [2, 4, 10]

VMC computes matrix elements with respect to the
square of a trial wave function, ψ. The most common
matrix element is the energy,

E = R dR ψ2(R; a)EL(R; a)

R dR ψ2(R; a)

(1)

where EL = 1
ψ Hψ. The variational principle states that
this energy will be greater than or equal to the true
ground state energy for any ψ. Typically, the wave func-
tion is parameterized and those parameters are varied
until a minimum energy [10] (or alternatively, minimum
variance [2, 8]) is reached.

The Metropolis method [11] constructs a transition
probability, P(s′ → s), for use in a Markov process. The
result of that process is the desired normalized probabil-
ity distribution. A correct transition probability can be
constructed by satisfying detailed balance,

π(s)P(s → s′) = π(s′)P(s′ → s)

(2)

where π(s) is the desired probability distribution (ψ2(R)
for VMC ). In the generalized Metropolis method, the
transition probability is split into two pieces, an a pri-
ori sampling distribution, T (s → s′) and an acceptance
probability A(s → s′).

The original Metropolis method generates a trial move,
R′, of one particle inside a box of side ∆ centered about
the old position, R. This leads to a constant T inside the
box and zero outside. The trial move is then accepted or
rejected with probability

A = min(cid:20)1,

ψ2(R′)

ψ2(R) (cid:21)

In electronic problems, a typical wave function is

ψ = De−U

(4)

where D is the product of spin up and spin down Slater
determinants of single particle orbitals and U is the two
(or higher) body Jastrow factor. This latter part contains
the explicit electron-electron correlation.

A simulation step consists of a trial move of every elec-
tron. Each trial move is accepted or rejected according
to Eq (3).

A single electron is moved at a time, which only
changes one column of the Slater matrix. By saving and
using the inverse of this matrix, computing the new de-
terminant and its derivatives is an O(N ) operation. [12]
If the move is accepted, the inverse matrix can be up-
dated with O(N 2) operations. (Note that computing the
determinant directly is of order O(N 3).) A smaller ac-
ceptance ratio will be faster, since fewer updates need to
be performed.

Multilevel sampling has been used extensively in path
integral Monte Carlo.
[13] In multilevel sampling, the
wave function is split into several factors (levels), and
an accept/reject step is performed after computing each
factor. The entire wave function is computed only if there
is an acceptance after every factor. Rejections will make
the overall algorithm faster, since not all the factors need
to be computed. For VMC it is natural to use two factors
- the single body part, D, as one factor and the two body
part, e−U , as the other. The single body part is the
cheaper of the two to compute, so computing it ﬁrst will
give the greatest reduction in time.

The two level sampling algorithm for VMC proceeds
as follows. A trial move, R′, is proposed and accepted at
the ﬁrst stage with probability

A1 = min(cid:20)1,

D2(R′)

D2(R) (cid:21)

(5)

If accepted at the ﬁrst stage, the two body part is
computed and the trial move is accepted with probability

A2 = min(cid:20)1,

exp [−2U (R′)]

exp [−2U (R)](cid:21)

(6)

It can be veriﬁed by substitution that these satisfy de-
tailed balance in Eq. (2). After an acceptance at this

2

second level, the inverse Slater matrices are updated as
described previously.

The ﬁgure of merit for these simulations is the eﬃ-

ciency

ξ =

1
σ2T

(7)

where T is the computer time and σ is the error estimate
of the average of some property such as the energy.

Maximum eﬃciency results from a competition be-
tween two eﬀects. The ﬁrst is that a lower acceptance
ratio will yield a lower run time and a larger eﬃciency.
The second is serial correlations. A lower acceptance ra-
tio will give a longer correlation time, hence a larger error
and lower eﬃciency.

In maximizing the eﬃciency, the obvious parameter to
adjust is the step size, ∆. But the number of steps be-
tween computations of EL can also be adjusted. The
Metropolis algorithm produces correlated state points,
so successive samples of EL don’t contain much new in-
formation. It is advantageous to compute EL every few
steps rather than every step. In this work the local en-
ergy was computed every 5 steps.

The algorithm is demonstrated using a Li2 molecule in
free space and a collection of 32 H2 molecules in a peri-

odic box. The wave functions, which are the ΨIII’s from
Reynolds, et al., [14] use a simple electron-electron and
electron-nuclear Jastrow term, and use ﬂoating Gaus-
sians for the orbitals. The hydrogen molecules were in
box of side 19.344 atomic units (rs = 3.0).

The results for the diﬀerent sampling methods for the
Li2 molecule are given in Tables I and II. The second
level acceptance ratio is quite high, indicating the single
body part is a good approximation to the whole wave
function. The eﬃciency is also shown in Figure 1.

The results for the diﬀerent sampling methods for the
H2 molecules are given in Tables III and IV. The eﬃ-
ciency is also shown in Figure 2.

Comparing the maximum eﬃciency for each sampling
method, two level sampling is 39% more eﬃcient than
the standard sampling for Li2, and 72% more eﬃcient
for 32 H2’s.

More complicated schemes using more levels or diﬀer-
ent splittings of the wave function could be devised. This
particular scheme is attractive because it uses quantities
readily available in a VMC computation, and requires
minimal modiﬁcation to existing VMC sampling algo-
rithms.

Abstract

We have developed a new methodology and a time-domain software package for the estimation

of the oscillation frequency and the phase noise spectrum of non-linear noisy microwave circuits

based on the direct integration of the system of stochastic diﬀerential equations representing the

circuit. Our theoretical evaluations can be used in order to make detailed comparisons with the

experimental measurements of phase noise spectra in selected oscillating circuits.

INTRODUCTION

Electronically tuned microwave oscillators are key components used in a wide variety of

microwave communications systems [1]. The phase of the output signal exhibits ﬂuctuations

in time about the steady state oscillations giving rise to Phase Noise a very important char-

acteristic that inﬂuences the overall performance especially at higher microwave frequencies.

In order to understand the oscillator phase behaviour, a statistical model for a non-linear

oscillating circuit has to be developed and presently, no accurate theoretical model for phase

noise characterization is available because of the particularly diﬃcult nature of this problem.

This is due to the hybrid nature of non-linear microwave oscillator circuits where distributed

elements (pertaining usually to the associated feeding or resonator circuits) and non-linear

elements (pertaining usually to the ampliﬁying circuit) have to be dealt with simultaneously

[1] .

The main aim of this report is to establish a theoretical framework for dealing with the

noise sources and non- linearities present in these oscillators, introduce a new methodol-

ogy to calculate the resonance frequency and evaluate the time responses (waveforms) for

various voltages and currents in the circuit without or with the noise present. Once this

is established, the phase noise spectrum is determined and afterwards the validity range

of the model is experimentally gauged with the use of diﬀerent types of microwave oscilla-

tors [2, 3]. This report is organised in the following way: Section II covers the theoretical

analysis for the oscillating circuit, reviews noise source models and earlier approches. Sec-

tion III presents results of the theoretical analysis and highlights the determination of the

resonance frequency for some oscillator circuits without noise. In section IV, phase noise

spectra are determined for several oscillator circuits and section V contains the experimen-

tal results. The Appendix contains circuit diagrams and corresponding state equations for

several non-linear oscillator circuits.

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

In standard microwave analysis, it is diﬃcult to deal with distributed elements in the time

domain and diﬃcult to deal with non-linear elements in the frequency domain. Non- linear

microwave oscillator circuits have simultaneously non- linear elements in the amplifying part

2

and distributed elements in the resonating part [Non-linearity is needed since it is well known

that only non-linear circuits have stable oscillations].

Before we tackle, in detail, the determination of the phase noise, let us describe the

standard procedure for dealing with the determination of resonance frequency of non-linear

oscillator circuits:

• The ﬁrst step is to develop a circuit model for the oscillator device and the tuning

elements. The equivalent circuit should contain inherently noiseless elements and noise

sources that can be added at will in various parts of the circuit. This separation is

useful for pinpointing later on the precise noise source location and its origin [2]. The

resulting circuit is described by a set of coupled non- linear diﬀerential equations that

have to be written in a way such that a linear sub-circuit (usually the resonating part)

is coupled to another non-linear sub-circuit (usually the oscillating part).

• The determination of the periodic response of the non- linear circuit.

• The third step entails performing small signal ac analysis (linearization procedure)

around the operating point. The result of the ac analysis is a system matrix which is

ill-conditioned since a large discrepency of frequencies are present simultaneously (One

has a factor of one million in going from kHz to GHz frequencies). The eigenvalues of

this matrix have to be calculated with extra care due to the sensitivity of the matrix

elements to any numerical roundoﬀ [3].

We diﬀer from the above analysis, by integrating the state equations directly with

standard/non- standard Runge-Kutta methods adapted to the non-stiﬀ/stiﬀ system of or-

dinary diﬀerential equations. The resonance frequency is evaluated directly from the wave-

forms and the noise is included at various points in the circuit as Johnson or Shot noise.

This allows us to deal exclusively with time domain methods for the noiseless/noisy non-

linear elements as well as the distributed elements. The latter are dealt with through an

equivalence to lumped elements at a particular frequency.

As far as point 3 is concerned, the linearization procedure method is valid only for small-

signal analysis whereas in this situation, we are dealing with the large signal case.

Previously, several methods have been developed in order to ﬁnd the periodic response.

The most well established methods are the Harmonic balance and the piecewise Harmonic

3

balance methods [6]. Schwab [4] has combined the time-domain (for the non-linear ampliﬁer

part) with the frequency domain (for the linear resonating part) methods and transformed

the system of equations into a boundary value problem that yields the periodic response of

the system.

III. TIME RESPONSES OF NON-LINEAR OSCILLATORS AND RESONANCE

FREQUENCY DETERMINATION

For illustration and validation of the method we solve 6 diﬀerent oscillator circuits (The

Appendix contains the circuit diagrams and the corresponding state equations):

• The standard Van der Pol oscillator.

• The amplitude controlled Van der Pol oscillator.

• The Clapp oscillator.

• The Colpitts oscillator.

• Model I oscillator.

• Model II oscillator.

We display the time responses (waveforms) for various voltages and currents in the at-

tached ﬁgures for each of the six oscillators. All oscillators reach periodic steady state almost

instantly except the amplitude controlled Van der Pol (ACVDP) and the Colpitts circuits.

For instance, we need, typically, several thousand time steps to drive the ACVDP circuit

into the oscillatory steady state whereas several hundred thousand steps are required for the

Colpitts circuit. Typically, the rest of the circuits studied reached the periodic steady state

in only less a couple of hundred steps.

IV. PHASE NOISE SPECTRUM EVALUATION

Once the oscillating frequency is obtained, device noise is turned on and its eﬀect on the

oscillator phase noise is evaluated. All the above analysis is performed with time domain

simulation techniques.

4

Finally, Fourier analysis is applied to the waveform obtained in order to extract the power

spectrum as a function of frequency. Very long simulation times (on the order of several

hundred thousand cycles) are needed since one expects inverse power-law dependencies on

the frequency [1].

We use a special Stochastic time integration method namely the 2S-2O-2G Runge-Kutta

method developed by Klauder and Peterson, and we calculate the PSD (Power Spectral

Density) from the time series obtained.

It is worth mentioning that our methodology is valid for any type of oscillator circuit and

for any type of noise (Additive White as it is in Johnson noise of resistors, Mutiplicative

and Colored or 1/f α with α arbitrary as it is for Shot noise stemming from junctions or

imperfections inside the device). In addition, the approach we develop is independent of the

magnitude of the noise. Regardless of the noise intensity we evaluate the time response and

later on the power spectrum without performing any perturbative development whatsoever.

Recently, Kartner [7] developed a perturbative approach to evaluate the power spectrum

without having to integrate the state equations. His approach is valid for weak noise only

and is based on an analytical expression for the power spectrum. Nevertheless one needs to

evaluate numerically one Fourier coeﬃcient g1,0 the spectrum depends on.

V. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION

Microwave oscillators are realised using a very wide variety of circuit conﬁgurations

and resonators. We plan to design, fabricate and test microstrip oscillators with GaAs

MESFET devices with coupled lines and ring resonators [5]. The measured phase noise of

these oscillators will be compared with the theoretical prediction from the above analysis.

We also plan to apply the above analysis to the experimental phase results obtained from

various electronically tuned oscillators that have been already published in the literature

[1, 2, 3, 4].

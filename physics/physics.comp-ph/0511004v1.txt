In this paper, a simply rule that generates scale-free networks with very large clustering coeﬃcient
and very small average distance is presented. These networks are called Multistage Random
Growing Networks(MRGN) as the adding process of a new node to the network is composed of
two stages. The analytic results of power-law exponent γ = 3 and clustering coeﬃcient C = 0.81 are
obtained, which agree with the simulation results approximately. In addition, the average distance of
the networks increases logarithmical with the number of the network vertices is proved analytically.
Since many real-life networks are both scale-free and small-world networks, MRGN may perform
well in mimicking reality.

The past few years have witnessed a great devotion by
physicists to understand and characterize the underlying
mechanisms of complex networks including the Internet,
the World Wide Web, the scientiﬁc collaboration net-
works and so on[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The results of many ex-
periments and statistical analysis indicate that the net-
works in various ﬁelds have some common characteris-
tics. They have a small average distance like random
graphs, a large clustering coeﬃcient and power-law de-
gree distribution [1, 2], which is called the small-world
and scale-free characteristics. Recent works on the math-
ematics of networks have been driven largely by the em-
pirical properties of real-life networks[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14? ]
and the studies on network dynamics[16,
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30],
optimization[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] and evolutionary
[37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]. The ﬁrst
successful attempt to generate networks with high clus-
tering coeﬃcients and small average distance is that of
Watts and Strogatz (WS model) [1]. Another signiﬁcant
model is proposed by Barab´asi and Albert called scale-
free network (BA network) [2]. The BA model suggests
that growth and preferential attachment are two main
self-organization mechanisms of the scale-free networks
structure. These point to the fact that many real-world
networks continuously grow by the way that new nodes
and edges are added to the network, and new nodes would
like to attach to the existing nodes with large number of
neighbors.

Dorogovtsev et. al proposed an simple model of scale-
free growing networks for any size of the network [42].
The idea of the model is that a new node is added to the
network at each time step, which connects to both ends
of a randomly chosen link undirected. The model can be
described by the process that the newly added node con-
nect to node i preferentially, then select a neighbor node
of the node i randomly. Holme et. al proposed the fa-
mous model to generate growing scale-free networks with
tunable clustering [43]. The model introduced a addi-
tional step to get the trial information and demonstrated
that the average number of triad formation trials con-
trols the clustering coeﬃcient of the network. It should

be noticed that the newly added node connected the ﬁrst
node i preferentially. Actually, it would like to connect
the neighbor nodes of node i preferentially. Inspired by
these questions, we give the multistage random growing
networks model. At each time step, the new node is
added to the network preferentially, then it would ﬁnd
one of the node’s neighbors to connect preferentially.

A scale-free small-world network using a very simple
rule is presented. The network starts with a triangle con-
taining three nodes marked as I, II and III. At each time
step, a new node is added to the network with two edges.
The ﬁrst edge would choosing node to connected depends
on the degree ki of node i, such that ki/ P ki, and then
attach another edge to a node which is connected with
the ﬁrst selected node preferentially. According to this
process, the general iterative algorithm of MRGN is in-
troduced. A(t) denotes MRGN after t iterations. Since
the network size increases by one at each time step, t is
used to represent the node added in the tth step. At step
t, we can easily see that the network consists of N = t+ 3
vertices. The total degree equals 4t + 3. When t is large,
the average degree at step t is equal approximate to a
constant value 4, which shows that MRGN is sparse like
many real-life network [3, 4, 5]. The topology character-
istics of the model are analyzed both analytically and by
numerical calculations. The analytical expressions agree
with the numerical simulations approximately.

The distribution is one of the most important statis-
tical characteristics of networks. Since many real-world
networks are scale-free networks, whether the network is
of the power-law degree distribution is a criterion to judge
the validity of the model. By using the mean-ﬁeld the-
ory, the evolution of the degree distribution of individual
nodes can be described as following

∂ki
∂t

= P (i) + X
j∈Γi

P (i|j)P (j),

(1)

where P (i) denotes the possibility that the node i with
degree ki is selected in the ﬁrst step, P (i|j) denotes the
conditional possibility that node i is the neighbor of node
j with degree kj which have been selected at the ﬁrst step

and Γi denotes the neighbor node set of node i. Because
the new node is added to the network preferentially, one
has

The conditional possibility P (i|j) can be calculated by

P (i) =

Since every newly added node has two edges, P (i|j) can
be approximately by P (i|j) = ki

that

The sum in the denominator goes over all nodes in the
network except the newly introduced one, thus its value
is Pj kj = 2t + 3. The solution of Equ. (4), with the
initial condition that every node i at its introduction has
ki(ti) = 2, is

As we have mentioned above, the degree distribution
is one of the most important statistical characteristics of
networks. The average distance is also one of the most
important parameters to measure the eﬃciency of com-
munication network. The average distance L of the net-
work is deﬁned as the mean distance over all pairs of
nodes. The average distance plays a signiﬁcant role in
measuring the transmission delay. Marked each node of
the network according to the time when the node is added
to the network. Firstly, we give the following lemma [37].
Lemma 1 For any two nodes i and j, each shortest
path from i to j does not pass through any nodes k satis-
fying that k > max{i, j}.

Proof. Denote the shortest path from node i to j of
length n + 1 by i → x1 → x2 · · · → xn → j(SPij ),
where n > 0. Suppose that xk = max{x1, x2, · · · , xn}, if
k ≤ max{i, j}, then the conclusion is true.

Then we prove the case that k > max{i, j} would not
come forth. Suppose the edge Ey1y2 is selected when
node xk is added. If k > max{i, j}, neither node i nor
node j is belong to the Ey1y2. Hence the path from i to j
passing through xk must enter and leave Ey1y2. Assume
that the path enter Ey1y2 by node y1 and leave from node
y2, then there exists a path of SPij from y1 to y2 passing
through xk, which is longer than the direct path y1 → y2.
The youngest node must be either i or j when SPij is the
shortest path.

Denote d(i, j) as the distance between node i and
node j. Let σ(N ) represent the total distance σ(N ) =
P1≤i<j≤N d(i, j). The average distance of MRGN with
order N , denoted by L(N ), is deﬁned as following

L(N ) =

2σ(N )
N (N − 1)

.

(7)

According to Lemma 3.1, the node newly added in the
network will not aﬀect the distance between old nodes.
Hence we have

σ(N + 1) = σ(N ) +

d(i, N + 1).

(8)

Assume that the (N +1)th node is add to the edge Ey1y2,
then Equ.(8) can be written as

σ(N + 1) = σ(N ) + N +

D(i, y).

(9)

where D(i, y) = min{d(i, y1), d(i, y2)}. Let a single node
y represent the Ey1y2 continuously, then we have the fol-
lowing equation

σ(N + 1) = σ(N ) + N + X
i=Λ

d(i, y),

(10)

where the node set Λ = {1, 2, · · · , N }−{y1, y2} have (N −
2) members. The sum Pi=Λ d(i, y) can be considered as
the distance from each node of the network to node y

in MRGN with order N − 1. Approximately, the sum
Pi=Λ d(i, y) is equal to L(N − 1). Hence we have

Then we can obtain the inequality

σ(N + 1) < σ(N ) + N +

Enlarge σ(N ), then the upper bound of the increasing
tendency of σ(N ) will be obtained by the following equa-
tion

This leads to the following solution

σ(N ) = log(N − 1)(N − 1)2 + C1(N − 1)2 − (N − 1). (15)

FIG. 2: The dependence between the average distance L and
the order N of MRGN. One can see that L increases very
slowly as N increases. The inset exhibits the curve where
L is considered as a function of lnN , which is ﬁtted by a
straight line. The curve is above the ﬁtting line when N is
small(2000 ≤ N ≤ 7000) and under the ﬁtting line when
N is large(N ≥ 8000), which indicates that the increasing
tendency of L can be approximated as lnN and in fact a little
slower than lnN . All the data are obtained by 10 independent
simulations.

By means of the theoretic approximate calculation, we
prove that the increasing tendency of L(N ) is a little
slower than lnN . In Fig 3, we report the simulation re-
sults on average distance of MRGN, which agree with the
analytic result.

FIG. 3: The clustering coeﬃcient of MRGN(red diamonds)
and Holme-Kim networks(green squares). In this ﬁgure, one
can ﬁnd that the clustering coeﬃcient of MRGN is almost a
constant a little smaller than 0.75. The red line represents the
analytic result 0.81. It is clear that, the clustering coeﬃcient
of Holme-Kim networks is much smaller than that of MRGN.

The small-world eﬀect consists of two properties: large
clustering coeﬃcient and small average distance. The
clustering coeﬃcient, denoted by C, is deﬁned as C =
Ci
N , where Ci is the clustering coeﬃcient for any

N
i=1

P
arbitrary node i. Ci is

Ci =

2E(i)
ki(ki − 1)

,

(16)

where E(i) is the number of edges in the neighbor set
of the node i, and ki is the degree of node i. When the
node i is added to the network, it is of degree 2 and
E(i) = 1. If a new node is added to be a neighbor of i at
some time step, E(i) will increase by one since the newly
added node will link to one of the neighbors of node x.
Therefore, in terms of ki the expression of E(i) can be
written as following

E(i) = 1 + (ki − 2) = ki − 1.

(17)

Hence, we have that

Ci =

2(ki − 1)
ki(ki − 1)

=

2
ki

.

This expression indicates that the local clustering scales
as Ci ∼ k−1. It is interesting that a similar scaling has
been observed in pseudofractal web [44] and several real-
life networks [45]. Consequently, we have

(18)

Since the degree distribution is p(k) = c1k−3, where k =

For suﬃcient large N , kmax ≫ 2. The parameter c1
satisﬁes the normalization equation

p(k)dk = 1.

(21)

It can be obtain that c1 = 4.9491 and C = 2 × 4.9491 ×
kmax
k=2 k−4 = 0.8149. From Fig. 4, we can get that the
P
analytical average clustering coeﬃcient deviance the real
value a little. Because the analytic one is obtained when
the time step t → ∞ and the simulation result is obtained
when the time step t is ﬁnite. The other reason is that
simulation result γ of the degree distribution deviant 3
a little, which is caused the ﬁnite network size. How-
ever, the most important reason lies in the hypothesis
(4) that there are no correlations between all nodes. The
demonstration exhibits that most real-life networks have
large clustering coeﬃcient no matter how many nodes
they have. That is agree with the case of MRGN but

conﬂict with the case of BA networks, thus MRGN may
be more appropriate to mimic the reality.

In summary, we have introduced a simple iterative al-
gorithm for constructing MRGN. The networks have very
large clustering coeﬃcients and very small average dis-
tance, which satisfy many real networks characteristics,
such as the technological and social networks. After the
newly added node connect to the ﬁrst node i, it con-
nect to the neighbor node of node i preferentially. They
are not only the scale-free networks, but also small-world
networks. The results imply the following conclusion: if
there are no correlation between all node and the new
node adds to the network in two step, whether the sec-
ond step is random or preferential, the degree distribu-
tion would be power-law and the exponent is 3. We have
computed the analytical expressions for the degree dis-
tribution and clustering coeﬃcient. Since most real-life
networks are both scale-free and small-world networks,
MRGN may perform better in mimicking reality. Fur-
ther work should focus on the information ﬂow and the
epidemic spread on MRGN.

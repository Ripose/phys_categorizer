A novel method for simulating the statistical mechanics of molecular systems in which both nu-
clear and electronic degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically is presented. The scheme
combines a path integral description of the nuclear variables with a ﬁrst-principles adiabatic de-
scription of the electronic structure. The electronic problem is solved for the ground state within a
density functional approach, with the electronic orbitals expanded in a localized (Gaussian) basis
set. The discretized path integral is computed by a Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling technique
on the normal modes of the isomorphic ring-polymer. An eﬀective short-time action correct to
order τ 4 is used. The validity and performance of the method are tested by studying two small
Lithium clusters, namely Li4 and Li+
5 . Structural and electronic properties computed within this
fully quantum-mechanical scheme are presented and compared to those obtained within the classical
nuclei approximation. Quantum delocalization eﬀects turn out to be signiﬁcant as shown by the fact
that quantum simulation results at 50 K approximately correspond to those of classical simulations
carried out at 150 K. The scaling factor depends, however, on the speciﬁc physical property, thus
evidencing the diﬀerent character of quantum and thermal correlations. Tunneling turns out to be
irrelevant in the temperature range investigated (50 K to 200 K).

I. INTRODUCTION

Light atoms, such as H, He, Li or Be, cannot very of-
ten be treated as classical particles, particularly at low
temperatures. As temperature decreases and the ther-
mal de Broglie wavelength increases, the quantum char-
acter emerges, and a description in terms of classical co-
ordinates and momenta breaks down. The most obvious
manifestation of the quantum character of light atoms is
a large zero-point-energy (ZPE). A particle of mass m
in a harmonic potential with characteristic frequency ω
will have a ZPE of ¯hω/2 and an associated spatial delo-
calization of ∆x =
¯h/mω. For instance, a proton in
a typical bonding environment such as a H-O bond or
a H2 molecule, will have a ZPE of 0.15 to 0.25 eV and
∆x between 0.2 and 0.3 rA. This represents a sizeable
eﬀect which could be decisive in stabilizing a particular
crystalline structure for a solid, or the ground state con-
ﬁguration of a molecule or a cluster. An even more inter-
esting manifestation of quantum eﬀects is the possibility
that these light nuclei can tunnel across potential energy
barriers, thus exploring classically forbidden regions of
conﬁguration space and giving rise to a variety of inter-
esting quantum eﬀects such as temperature-independent
diﬀusion, exotic ground states, resonances in ion-surface

p

scattering, and ﬂuxional molecules. Signatures of quan-
tum eﬀects can also be observed in low-energy atomic
collisions, or in proton-transfer reactions in the gas and
condensed phases.

To date, most studies that consider the quantum char-
acter of atomic nuclei are based on an empirical descrip-
tion of the interatomic interactions, or otherwise con-
sist of extending and/or correcting a posteriori the re-
sults obtained within a classical nuclei approximation.
Classical potentials are frequently not transferable from
one environment to another, and are ill-suited to mod-
eling phenomena involving signiﬁcant electronic density
redistribution, as in the making and breaking of chemical
bonds. The natural route to overcome these limitations
is to describe the interactions at a ﬁrst-principles level,
i.e. by including explicitly the electronic component in
the description of the system. The recent development of
such schemes, which address the question of the interplay
between electronic structure and the quantum nature of
light nuclei, has only very recently began to be realized,
thus opening a fascinating ﬁeld with important implica-
tions in many branches of physics, chemistry and biology.
Since small clusters usually exhibit rich landscapes of
isomeric forms within narrow energy bands1, they consti-
tute good systems for studying the eﬀects of quantum de-

1

localization and associated tunneling behavior. Lithium
clusters are particularly interesting because in addition
to the small atomic mass, they are bound by metallic
many-body interactions which cannot be adequately rep-
resented by means of classical interatomic potentials2.

In the remainder of this Introduction we outline the
methodology that we have developed to study this class
of problems, and review the present understanding of Li
clusters which is the test system for our method. In Sec-
tion II we introduce the theoretical framework of our ab
initio path integral approach and discuss the approxima-
tions involved. Section III is devoted to the details of
the practical implementation of the path integral Monte
Carlo (PIMC) and the electronic structure methods. In
Section IV we present the validation of the electronic
structure calculations, zero-temperature geometries and
electronic properties of Li4 and Li+
5 clusters. The re-
sults of our simulations for the classical and quantum
Li4 and Li+
5 clusters at ﬁnite temperatures are presented
in Section V. Section VI contains our conclusions and an
assessment of the potential of this novel simulation tool.

A. Methodological aspects

The goal of the present work is to introduce a novel
computational technique for studying the statistical me-
chanics of isolated systems like clusters and molecules
containing light atoms. Our approach combines an
imaginary-time path integral description of the nuclear
degrees of freedom3 with a ﬁrst-principles density func-
tional (DFT) description of the electronic structure4.
Since the natural choice for investigating isolated systems
is to use a localized basis set for the electronic orbitals,
we adopt a Gaussian basis set5.
In the present imple-
mentation the electronic structure is computed at the
all-electron level, i.e. explicitly including core electrons.
The sampling of the path integral is implemented using
Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. The electronic energy is
minimized for each nuclear conﬁguration, and the MC re-
jection step is also performed using the energy calculated
at the same level of sophistication.

Other schemes along these lines have been recently
proposed by Marx and Parrinello6, and Cheng et al.7.
At variance with our approach, these two methods use
Molecular Dynamics (MD) for sampling the path inte-
gral, a plane-wave (PW) expansion for the electronic or-
bitals and treat the electron-ion interaction at the pseu-
dopotential level. PW expansions with periodic bound-
ary conditions are more appropriate for extended systems
such as solids or liquids though they can be adequately
modiﬁed to deal with isolated systems6.

The evaluation of real-time path integrals, which would
include the full dynamical information, is an extremely
diﬃcult numerical task because the integrand is a rapid
oscillatory function of the path. In the imaginary-time
framework the statistical weight is real and positive def-

inite, so that the integrals are well-conditioned, but the
price is that the dynamics is not directly accessible. In
it is
the absence of real-time dynamical information,
not particularly advantageous to sample the integral us-
ing MD in place of MC techniques.
In particular, the
MD technique requires elaborate thermostatting mecha-
nisms8 in order to overcome ergodicity problems in the
sampling of the quasi-harmonic degrees of freedom that
appear in the path integral formulation (see Section II).
In the present method we propose a Metropolis MC sam-
pling technique on the normal modes of the polymer,
which has less severe ergodicity problems, and is more
convenient from the point of view of eﬃcient evaluation
of the path action (see Section III)9. Moreover, the MC
strategy is easy to interface with any electronic structure
code.

B. Small Lithium clusters

−

Structural and electronic properties of Lin and Li+
n
clusters have been systematically investigated for n =
9 by means of ab initio conﬁguration-interaction cal-
2
culations10. A key observation was the existence of sev-
eral isomers of comparable energy. Recently, ab initio
classical MD simulations at the Hartree-Fock (HF) and
non-local density functional (NLDF) level were carried
out in order to explore the cluster dynamics as a function
of temperature, to analyze isomerization reactions, and
to study the melting transition11–14. The extent to which
diﬀerent levels of ﬁrst-principles calculations are reliable
for describing small Li clusters has been very recently
discussed by Rousseau and Marx15, who concluded that
either ab initio MP2 calculations, or gradient corrected
NLDF provide a reasonable potential energy landscape,
while HF and LDF are inadequate.

This aspect is very important because the energy land-
scape determines the probability with which the cluster
visits diﬀerent possible geometries. In general, the abil-
ity to jump from one minimum to another will depend
on the extent of both thermal and quantum ﬂuctuations.
Fig. 1 shows three typical situations: At low temper-
atures quantum delocalization is the dominant mecha-
nism. If the ZPE is higher than the barrier between the
two minima (a), or smaller than the barrier but larger
than the energy diﬀerence between them (b) (tunneling
regime), the ground state wave function will sample both
conﬁgurational minima.
If, instead, it is smaller than
the energy diﬀerence between the two minima (c), then
the ground state will be basically unchanged from the
classical one, though all structural distributions will be
broadened by quantum delocalization. Thermal excita-
tions can promote a classical-like situation like (c) to a
thermally-assisted tunneling regime.

The above picture is valid as long as the electronic
ground state is non-degenerate, and this is realized for
clusters with closed electronic shells. Open-shell clus-

2

ters undergo Jahn-Teller distortions, and are character-
ized by degenerate ground states and pseudo-rotations.
An adequate treatment of this situation would require
the introduction of the concepts of conical intersections
and geometric phases16. Though these phenomena are
17
of great interest, and have indeed been detected in Li3
18, we have preferred to avoid this extra compli-
and Li5
cation at this stage in the development of our method.

Quantum nuclear eﬀects in Li clusters were ﬁrst ad-
dressed by Ballone and Milani19, who studied magic-
number clusters (20, 40 and 92 atoms) by means of PIMC
simulations using a simple, jellium model description of
the electronic component. Their most interesting obser-
vation was the existence of a large number of isomers
diﬀering only in the location of the outermost atoms,
such that quantum tunneling amongst these isomers led
to a ﬂuid-like behavior. A very recent ab initio path inte-
gral MD study of Li8 and Li20 clusters by Rousseau and
Marx20 shows that this picture does not hold when the
description of the electronic component is improved, thus
demonstrating the necessity of going beyond the jellium-
type description.

For our study we have chosen the following two exam-
ples: Li4 has a single isomer and is well described by a
quasi-classical picture. Li+
5 , has two isomers at an en-
ergy diﬀerence of about 150 K, and two other isomers
at higher energies (see section 5). The zero-point-energy
is of the order of 100 K, so that Li+
5 could constitute a
good candidate for exhibiting signiﬁcant quantum eﬀects
in terms of the sampling of conﬁgurational minima. The
results presented in section 5 will show that, in spite of
this, Li+
5 actually behaves in a very similar way to Li4.

II. THE AB INITIO PATH INTEGRAL
PARTITION FUNCTION

The statistical mechanics of quantum many-body sys-
tems can be formulated in terms of the two-point density
matrix, or imaginary-time propagator:

ρ(R, R′

, β) =< R

R′

|
whose trace is the partition function
. β = 1/kBT is the
inverse temperature. The path integral representation of
the density matrix is given by

ρ(R, R′

(2)

where R(u) represents the conﬁguration of an N -body
system as a function of imaginary time u. The range of u
is from 0 to β¯h and the paths considered are restricted to
those beginning at R(0) = R and ending at R(β¯h) = R′.
The partition function can be similarly expressed as a
path integral with contributions from all possible cyclic
paths for which R(0) = R(β¯h).
[R(u)] represents the
diﬀerential element for all paths. The Euclidean action,
S[R(u)], associated with a path is deﬁned as

The ﬁrst term corresponds to the kinetic energy con-
tribution to the action, with m the mass of the parti-
cles. The generalization to heterogeneous systems, i.e.
composed of two or more species of diﬀerent masses, is
straightforward.

In order to devise a feasible computational scheme, the
path integral is typically discretized by representing the
cyclic paths as a ﬁnite set of 3N -dimensional conﬁgu-
rations, Ri, at equispaced points in imaginary time be-
tween 0 and β¯h. The degree of discretisation is referred
to as the Trotter number, P . The short-time or high tem-
perature propagator, ρ(Ri, Ri+1; β/P ), can be evaluated
semi-classically at diﬀerent levels of approximation. The
contribution of the kinetic energy term to the short-time
action is written in terms of a ﬁrst-order ﬁnite diﬀerence
between conﬁgurations on adjacent time slices, while the
short-time integral of the potential energy together with
higher-order corrections to the kinetic energy, is replaced
with an eﬀective, quantum-corrected potential Vef f (R).
The sum of the two terms is referred to as the eﬀective
action. Therefore, the expression for the partition func-
tion of N interacting, distinguishable quantum particles
with Trotter number P is given by:

According to the level of approximation of the eﬀective
action, the number of slices P needed to achieve conver-
gence in the partition function can be small enough that
the problem is tractable, or large enough that the evalua-
tion of the multidimensional integral becomes a hopeless
task. It is therefore important to use the best possible
eﬀective action compatible with the computational com-
plexity involved in its calculation. The simplest one, or
primitive approximation, replaces the eﬀective potential
by the bare potential, which is equivalent to an end-point
approximation for the short-time integral:

and is correct only to order τ 2. At the other extreme,
the pair-action approximation provides a very accurate
technique when the full, many-body potential can be rea-
sonably approximated with a sum of pair potentials. This
scheme has been very eﬀectively exploited to investigate
the properties of liquid and superﬂuid He down to tem-
peratures of about 1 K 21, a task that would not have
been possible using the primitive action.

As mentioned in the introduction, classical interaction
potentials are computationally fast, but very often un-
reliable. Realistic interaction potentials can instead be

3

obtained from more expensive ﬁrst-principles techniques.
In these latter, the electronic degrees of freedom are ex-
plicitly included in the Hamiltonian description of the
system:

(R, r) = ˆTn + ˆTe + ˆVee(r) + ˆVen(r, R) + ˆVnn(R), (6)

ˆ
H
where r and R are the electronic and nuclear coordinates,
ˆT and ˆV stand for kinetic and potential operators, while
subscripts e and n indicate electronic and nuclear compo-
nents, respectively. The path integral representation for
the partition function could then be developed using the
coordinate basis for both the electrons and the nuclei22.
However, standard electronic structure calculations are
carried out in a wave function representation by resort-
ing to the adiabatic separation of nuclear and electronic
motion.
It is therefore more convenient to expand the
electronic component in the adiabatic basis set where
φα > and total energies Eα(R)

are obtained by diagonalising the electronic Hamiltonian
ˆTe + ˆVee(r) + ˆVen(r, R) + ˆVnn(R). If τ = β/P , then the

α (R) is an eﬀective potential which derives di-
rectly from the electronic structure. In the primitive ap-
proximation, which is what has been used in other ab
initio path integral methods6,7, the eﬀective potential is
simply the total energy corresponding to adiabatic state
α of the electronic Hamiltonian, i.e. Eα(R).

The nuclear kinetic energy operator can give rise to
non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements between adia-
batic eigenstates. If these are negligible, but more than
one Born-Oppenheimer (BO) surface is occupied due to
thermal excitations, then the partition function will split
into independent manifolds indexed by the BO electronic
eigenstate. In the absence of degeneracies in the ground
electronic state, the energy diﬀerences between electronic
eigenstates are typically orders of magnitude larger than
reasonable thermal kinetic energies. Consequently only
the ground electronic state contributes to the partition
function and the electrons only enter at the level of re-
placing the total potential energy with the ground state

This is the partition function that will be evaluated us-
ing Monte Carlo techniques. The expression for
ZN P
can be interpreted as the partition function of N classi-
cal polymers, each of P monomeric units or beads, with
adjacent beads linked by harmonic springs with force con-
stant mP/β¯h2. Beads on two separate cyclic polymers
are coupled by the interaction potential only if they lie
on the same time slice.

Let us remark that the computation of excited elec-
tronic states is an open issue in density functional the-
ory, and it is known that the usual approximations to ex-
change and correlation, like the LDA and even NLDF do
not provide reliable excitation energies. Excited states
could be calculated properly using very high-level ab
,
initio methods. However, since we have developed a
methodology in which the electronic degrees of freedom
are dealt within DFT, we are for the time being not in a
position to incorporate non-adiabatic couplings and ex-
cited electronic manifolds.

III. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

A. Path integral Monte Carlo

1. Eﬀective action

· · ·

We use a discretized time representation in which a
, i =
path is described as a set of conﬁgurations,
1,
P , at P -equispaced points in imaginary time. The
eﬀective short-time propagator for two adjacent points
along the path has been evaluated to fourth-order ac-
curacy in τ = β/P , so that the ﬁrst-principles eﬀective
potential reads23:

(11)

where xij is the 3-dimensional vector of the coordinates
of particle j in slice i, such that Ri = (xi1, xi2,
, xiN ).
This form of the eﬀective action leads to an error of the
order of P (β/P )5 in the partition function and allows
us to signiﬁcantly reduce the Trotter number required
for convergence as compared to the primitive action (see
Section V).

· · ·

The quantum correction to the potential requires the
evaluation of the ﬁrst-principles forces Fj =
∂E0/∂xj
in the ground electronic state. The cost of this oper-
ation is of the same order of magnitude as the rest of
the electronic structure calculation, at least in most ab
initio or density functional schemes. In contrast, second
and higher-order derivatives are suﬃciently expensive to
evaluate that the computational advantages of a more
accurate short-time action are lost.

−

2. Normal modes sampling

The above expression for the partition function can
be directly used to set up a Metropolis MC simulation
scheme by assigning the appropriate Boltzmann weight to
each conﬁguration of the N
P -dimensional isomorphic
×
classical system. However, as quantum eﬀects increase,
the degree of discretisation must be increased to main-
tain accuracy. Since the harmonic force constant between
adjacent beads on the quantum polymer is mP/β¯h2, in-
creasing the Trotter index results in increasingly stiﬀ
harmonic links and the computational problem of ensur-
ing the ergodicity of the Metropolis walk becomes in-
tractable. An intuitively appealing and computationally
simple way for circumventing this diﬃculty comes from
considering the normal modes of the quantum polymer24.
In the absence of an interaction potential, all Cartesian
degrees of freedom of the system are decoupled. For a sin-
gle degree of freedom the harmonic intra-polymer poten-
tial is given by Vp = (mP/2β¯h2)
xl+1)2. Diag-
onalization of the second derivative matrix of this poten-
, P ,
tial leads to the normal coordinates,

The zero-frequency mode (k = P ) corresponds to mo-

no contribution to the kinetic energy. All other nor-
mal modes would be Gaussian distributed with variance
k = β¯h2/4mP sin2(πk/P ) if they corresponded to free
σ2
particles. The potential energy term couples these nor-
mal modes and cause distortions from the free-particle
distribution. The low-frequency modes correspond to
large, collective motions of all beads of the polymer, while
the high-frequency modes cause small, local path ﬂuctu-
ations. The normal modes are then used as Metropolis
variables and the displacements scaled according to the
Gaussian dispersions associated with each normal mode.

B. Electronic structure calculations

The calculation of the electronic energies is carried
out within the framework of DFT. For a given nuclear
conﬁguration, Kohn-Sham single-particle equations25 are
solved self-consistently for the electronic density, and the
total energy and forces are computed accordingly. Kohn-
Sham orbitals are expanded in a Gaussian basis set.

The electronic density is also expanded in an additional
Gaussian basis set26. The coeﬃcients for the ﬁt of the
electronic density are computed by minimizing the error
in the Coulomb repulsion energy. The use of this pro-
cedure results in an important speedup, since the cost

5

of evaluating matrix elements reduces from O(N 4) to
O(N 2M ) (N is the number of functions in the orbital
set, and M the number of functions in the auxiliary set,
typically of size comparable to N ).

Matrix elements of the exchange-correlation potential
are calculated by a numerical integration scheme based
on grids and quadratures proposed by Becke27. During
the self-consistency cycle, the integration is performed on
a set of coarse atom-centered, spherical grids. At the end
of the self-consistent procedure, the exchange-correlation
energy is evaluated using an augmented, ﬁner grid. This
strategy of combining coarse and ﬁne grids results in a
considerable gain in computational eﬃciency, which is
very important because this part is one of the main bot-
tlenecks of the calculation.

The exchange-correlation term is described a gradient
corrected NLDF level. Correlation is given by the pa-
rameterization of the homogeneous electron gas of Vosko
et al.28 supplemented with the gradient corrections pro-
posed by Perdew29. Gradient corrections to the exchange
term are taken from Becke30.

The ﬁrst derivatives of the energy with respect to the
nuclear coordinates, required by the fourth-order eﬀec-
tive action, are evaluated by taking analytical derivatives
of one-electron and Coulomb terms, while the exchange-
correlation contribution is obtained by numerical inte-
gration5.

A. Validation of the basis set and optimized

We have analyzed ﬁve diﬀerent basis sets for Li4 and
+. The ﬁrst one (labeled 1) is the standard 3-21G

basis31. The second set (labeled 2) is a double zeta plus
polarization basis set, optimized for DFT calcultions32.
The third one (labeled 3) is the standard 6-311G basis33,
the fourth set (labeled 4) is the 6-311G set augmented
with a polarization function (6-311G*), and ﬁnally the
ﬁfth set (labeled 5), consists of a large uncontracted ba-
sis set (13s/9p/1d), proposed by Dunning34. The calcu-
lations performed with basis sets optimized for standard
ab-initio calculations (labeled 1, 3, 4, and 5) have been
carried out using an uncontracted auxiliary basis set with
a scheme (7s/3p/3d), as proposed in Ref. 32 and 10. The
calculations performed with basis set 2 have been car-
ried out using an auxiliary basis set proposed in Ref. 32,
with a scheme (7s/2p/1d). Full geometry optimizations
without symmetry constraints have been performed in all
cases.

In agreement with previous work10,15, only one stable
minimum with a rhombus geometry has been found for
+ we found four stable lo-
Li4 (see Fig. 2), while for Li5
cal minima (also shown in Fig. 2). The highest energy

isomer, i.e.
isomer I, consists of two triangles which lie
on the same plane, joined by a shared central atom. The
isomer II, is similar to isomer I, but
second isomer, i.e.
now the triangles lie on perpendicular planes. The third
isomer, i.e. isomer III, has C2 symmetry, and can be de-
scribed as an isosceles triangle plus a dimer. The dimer
is located perpendicularly to the plane of the triangle,
close to its shortest side. The fourth isomer, i.e. isomer
IV, has a trigonal bipyramidal structure.
It should be
pointed out that neither isomer II nor isomer III have
been reported in earlier works, probably because of sym-
metry constraints used during the geometry optimization
procedure. The basis set dependence of the binding ener-
gies is shown in Figure 3. Relevant structural parameters
for all basis sets considered here are given in Table I. Our
results for basis set 4 agree with those reported for the
same functional and basis set in Ref. 15 for Li4 and for
isomers I and IV of Li+
5 .

The data in Figure 3 and Table I show that calculations
performed using basis set 2 yielded results that deviate
considerably from the ones obtained using the very large
basis set 5, which can be considered as almost converged.
Even if the errors in computed bond lengths and binding
energies are not too large (about 5 % for bond lenghts
and 5-10 % for binding energies), calculations carried out
using basis set 2 fail in reproducing the energy sequence
+. This can be ascribed to the fact that
of isomers of Li5
the description of the p-shell using this set is rather poor,
since it contains only one function. On the other hand,
calculations performed with basis sets 1, 3 and 4 yield the
+ and structural
same energy ordering for isomers of Li5
results within 2-3% from the almost converged, basis set
5, values.

Basis set superposition error (BSSE)35 calculations for
Li4 yield 14.36, 1.00, 0.96, 2.34, and 0.13 kJ/mol, for
basis sets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. It is clear that in
order to reduce BSSE, and obtain meaningful interaction
energies, a better description of the p-shell than the one
provided by the small basis set 1 is required.

In view of these results, the intermediate basis set 3
(6-311G), which yields results close to the ones obtained
with the larger sets is chosen to perform the electronic
structure calculations required in the MC simulations.
The relative energies with respect to the most stable iso-
mer, isomer IV, for isomers I, II, and III, are 17.58, 15.16,
and 9.67 kJ/mol, respectively, for calculations using ba-
sis set 3, compared with 19.38, 17.08, and 11.01 kJ/mol,
respectively, using the large set 5.

B. Electronic properties: dipole moments, Mulliken
population charges and eigenvalues

The Li4 cluster is non-polar (vanishing dipole moment)
+ is a charged system, so its
for symmetry reasons. Li5
dipole moment depends on the choice of the origin. How-
ever, it is customary to evaluate the dipole moment using
the center of charge as the origin, and in that case it pro-
vides a useful indicator of the asymmetry of the charge
distribution, and could also be experimentally relevant.
Isomers I, and II are non polar, isomer IV is only slightly
polar, but isomer III is considerably polar. The dipole
moments of isomers III and IV, computed using basis set
3, are 1.163 D and 0.017 D, respectively. Mulliken pop-
ulation charges36 are also useful indicators of the charge
distribution. Results obtained with basis set 3 for Li4 and
+ are shown in Table II. Signiﬁcant
the four isomers of Li5
diﬀerences are observed between diﬀerent isomers, even
between isomers I and II which are very similar both,
geometrically and energetically. Both quantities provide
useful indicators of isomerization during the MC simula-
tions in the Li5

+ case.

In addition, we present the two highest occupied and
two lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies for Li4
+ in Table II. The HOMO-
and the four isomers of Li5
LUMO gap is quite large in all cases, with values around
1 eV. Therefore, it is unlikely that either thermal or quan-
tum ﬂuctuations will contribute to its closure.

V. RESULTS OF THE PIMC-DFT SIMULATIONS

A. Sampling strategy and convergence of the path
integral with the degree of discretisation

We used a simple Metropolis algorithm for the PIMC
simulations with each trial move consisting of an attempt
to move all the normal modes associated with all the par-
ticles. Two diﬀerent step-sizes were used: δc and δs. The
maximum displacement of the center-of-mass was set by
δc, and that of the normal modes of order k – associated
with a length scale σk – by σk ×
δs. We have analyzed
the possibility of introducing an additional convergence
parameter k∗, such that modes with k < k∗ or k > P
k∗
−
σk, while
are moved with a relatively small step size, δs ×
those associated with small length scale ﬂuctuations are
σk (δl > δs).
moved by amounts proportional to δl ×
However, it turned out that, in this particular case, a
single step size δs for all values of k was eﬃcient enough.
This is often not the case when a large number of Trotter
slices is used. The various parameters were adjusted to
keep the overall acceptance ratio around 50% though oc-
casional runs were used with acceptance ratios between
40% and 60%. The same displacement parameter for the
center-of-mass δc was used for both classical and quan-
tum simulations.

Simulations on the Li2 dimer using a classical potential
ﬁtted to ﬁrst-principles calculations were used to check
the convergence of various properties with the degree of
discretisation.

Table III gives the PIMC results for the expectation
value of the potential and kinetic energies using the prim-
itive action and the fourth-order corrected form of the
action.
It can be observed that convergence to within
the statistical error bars occurs with a Trotter number of
just 4 when using the fourth-order correction, in contrast
are
to 16 when using the primitive action. Errors in
an order of magnitude less than those in

This is typical of the relatively facile convergence of
expectation values of operators diagonal in the coordi-
nates as opposed to those than must be evaluated using
thermodynamic estimators. In our experience, structural
quantities such as pair distribution functions converge
even faster than the potential energy. The increase in
the error bars – at constant number of MC conﬁgura-
tions – as the Trotter number is increased is also typical
of PIMC simulations. Based on our tests with Li2 we
used a Trotter number of 4 at 100K and 8 at 50K for the
larger clusters.

We have performed a series of classical and quantum
+ clusters, with
Monte Carlo simulations for Li4 and Li5
temperatures ranging from 50 K to 200 K. Each of
them consisted of 10000-15000 Monte Carlo steps, pre-
ceeded by around 1000 steps of thermalization. We
stored atomic coordinates, energies, eigenvalues, Mul-
liken population charges and dipole moment for each MC
step, for later analysis.

In the following we will concentrate only in struc-
tural parameters, one-electron eigenvalues, and dipole
moments, leaving aside other thermodynamical proper-
ties which would need longer simulations to reduce the
statistical error bars to useful values.

B. Results for Li4 and Li+
5

As mentioned in Section IV, Li4 has a single, deep
minimum at the 1A singlet state, in the form of a pla-
nar rhombus. Due to this fact the cluster is very rigid
and thermal and/or quantum eﬀects basically sample the
PES around the minimum. The Li+
5 cluster constitutes
a somewhat richer example due to the existence of sev-
eral isomers. In particular, it is interesting to analyze the
possibility of thermal activation and quantum tunneling
between diﬀerent regions of conﬁguration space. In order
to explore diﬀerent regions of the PES, classical simula-
tions were started from three diﬀerent isomers, namely
the ground state (isomer IV), and two higher energy con-
ﬁgurations (isomers I and III). After a few thousand MC
steps it was observed that the second and third simu-
lations were attracted towards the ground state basin,
showing that our MC strategy is quite eﬀective in equi-
librating and exploring conﬁguration space, possibly be-
cause interconversion barriers were low. Based on this,
quantum simulations were started from the ground state
(isomer IV) and, in order to facilitate the detection of
possible tunneling behavior, also from the ﬁrst excited
isomer (isomer III). Again, the isomerization towards the
ground state was observed in this latter; the polymer
moved as a whole, without showing any signature of tun-
neling. Let us mention that none of the higher-energy
isomers appeared again during the simulation, although
structures slightly reminiscent of isomer III (the closest
in energy to the ground state) were observed. In other
words, Li+
5 appears to be unable to sample metastable re-

gions of conﬁgurational space out from the ground state.
Figure 4(a) shows the radial distribution function g(r)
of Li4 in the classical case, and for diﬀerent temperatures.
It can be observed that the peaks are approximately cen-
tered at the optimized zero-temperature distances. Tem-
perature eﬀects consist basically of broadening the peaks;
the ﬁrst of them, corresponding to the ﬁrst neighbour
shell, almost disappears above 200 K.
In Figure 4(b)
we show the eﬀects of the quantum nature of the nu-
clei by comparing simulations performed at 50 K using
the classical and quantum schemes. It can be observed
that quantum eﬀects generate a pronounced broadening
of the peaks, thus demonstrating the importance of their
inclusion.

In Figure 5 we show the radial distribution functions
g(r) for Li+
5 in the classical (a) and quantum (b) cases.
The main panels contain the distribution averaged over
all the 5 particles. Two groups of atoms can be identi-
ﬁed: a ﬁrst one composed of three atoms more strongly
bound, which form the central triangle of the bipyrami-
dal structure IV, and a second one composed by the two
external atoms. The upper inset shows the partial g(r)
corresponding to these two groups in the classical case at
100 K, and the lower inset in the quantum case at 50 K.
No qualitative diﬀerence with Li4 can be observed.

The trends discussed above also hold for the electronic
properties, i.e. the distribution of one-particle eigenval-
ues. As can be observed in Figure 6(a), the HOMO and
LUMO eigenvalue distributions for Li+
5 exhibit signiﬁ-
cant broadenings upon temperature increase. It is to be
remarked that the widths are diﬀerent for diﬀerent eigen-
values, a fact that could be reﬂected in the temperature
dependence of the optical photoabsorption spectrum37.
Similar broadenings can be observed in the lower panel,
corresponding to the quantum and classical simulations
for Li+
5 performed at 50 K. As advanced above, the
minimum HOMO-LUMO distance never becomes smaller
than about 0.5 eV, so that quantum eﬀects cannot pro-
mote an eigenvalue crossing which would result in a ma-
jor modiﬁcation of the electronic properties.

Another important quantity is the electric dipole mo-
ment, because of its experimental relevance. For Li4 the
dipole moment vanishes at zero temperature due to sym-
metry considerations. However, at ﬁnite temperature the
cluster samples regions of the PES characterized by a ﬁ-
nite dipole moment, such that the mean value is non-
vanishing. A more pronounced eﬀect of the same type
can be observed in the quantum simulations. The aver-
ages computed using the classical and quantum schemes
at 50 K are (0.17
0.15) D, for Li4 and
(0.14
5 , respectively.
The quantum dipole moment averages and distributions
obtained at 50 K are similar to those obtained classically
at about 100 K.

It is interesting to note that where structural proper-
ties are concerned, the overall eﬀect of considering quan-
tum nuclei is qualitatively similar to the eﬀect of in-
creasing temperature in the classical simulations. For

8

the closed-shell Li clusters considered in this work the
classical temperature equivalent to the quantum system
at 50 K is around 150 K. However, the dipole moment
and eigenvalue distributions obtained using the quantum
mechanical scheme at 50 K are qualitatively similar to
those obtained within the classical scheme at about 100
K. This points out an important diﬀerence between the
two types of correlations involved in the statistical me-
chanics of quantum systems, namely coherent quantum
ﬂuctuations as opposed to incoherent thermal ﬂuctua-
tions. These appear to behave in diﬀerent ways according
to the physical properties under consideration.

Further characterization of the wave packet behaviour
of the nuclei is provided by the imaginary-time corre-

t′ < β¯h. The value at τ = β¯h/2 is par-
0 < τ = t
ticularly important because it gives an estimation of the
quantum delocalization of the nuclei. The delocalization
length, or gyration radius, is about 0.15 rA for both
Li4 and Li+
5 at 50 K. The imaginary time correlation
function for Li4 is shown in Figure 7, averaged for atoms
1 and 2 (lower curve) , and for 3 and 4 (upper curve).
It can be noticed that the two atoms which are more
strongly bound (1 and 2 in Figure 2) are less delocalized
than the other two, as may be expected.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have introduced a novel method for simulating
the statistical mechanics of quantum nuclei interacting
through ﬁrst-principles potentials, i.e.
that derive di-
rectly from the electronic structure. The scheme pre-
sented and discussed here combines a path integral de-
scription of the nuclear variables with an adiabatic,
ground state, density functional description of the elec-
tronic degrees of freedom. In the present scheme we have
choosen a speciﬁc (NLDF-Gaussian) formulation to solve
the electronic structure problem, but it is important to
stress that any other implementation is perfectly valid
and compatible with the present scheme, e.g. ab initio
quantum chemical approaches like Hartree-Fock or MP2,
and/or diﬀerent localized (LCAO, LMTO) or extended
(pseudopotential or augmented PW) basis sets. More-
over, the present scheme is extremely simple to interface
with any electronic structure code, since the only input
needed to compute the statistical weigths are the (self-
consistently) converged energy and forces. MD sampling
schemes are more involved in this respect.

We have shown the adequacy and the performance of
this methodology by simulating quantum nuclear eﬀects
in the clusters Li4 and Li+
5 . The number of imaginary-
time slices needed to achieve convergence to a relative
error of 0.5% in the nuclear kinetic energy is 4 at a tem-
perature of 100 K, and 8 at 50 K. The same level of
accuracy is obtained only with 16 slices (at 100 K) if the
primitive approximation to the action is used. This rep-

resents a gain of a factor of 4, which is very important
due to the high computational cost of these simulations.
The level of gain depends, however, on the shape of the
potential energy surface sampled by the nuclei.

The results presented here for the above clusters show
that, at temperatures below 50 K, quantum nuclear ef-
fects are crucial to account for their structural and elec-
tronic properties. Pair correlation functions are quite
broadened with respect to the classical counterparts, to
a level that similar distributions would be obtained for an
eﬀective temperature of about 150 K if only thermal, and
not also quantum, ﬂuctuations were considered. The re-
sults at T = 50 K can be considered to be representative
of the ground state, as quantum nuclear eﬀects largely
overcome thermal motion. Electronic properties like one-
electron eigenvalues and dipole moments show the same
type of broadened distributions, although the eﬀective
classical temperature appears to be slightly lower, around
100 K, instead of 150 K. This is to emphasize that quan-
tum eﬀects cannot be readily mimicked by adding extra
thermal ﬂuctuations, because the correlations involved
are of a completely diﬀerent character: quantum motion
is coherent while thermal motion is incoherent.

The simulation technology presented here opens up the
possibility of studying the role of light nuclei, especially
protons, in biological and chemical systems. The ad-
vantage of describing the electronic component using a
localized basis set (as Gaussians), as opposed to a PW
basis set, for isolated clusters and molecules as well as
for gas-phase reactions, is obvious because the vacuum
around is easily taken into account. In addition, very of-
ten reactive condensed-phase systems and large biological
molecules do not need a full quantum description because
the relevant chemical processes occur in a circumscribed
region of space. For example, enzymatic reactions re-
quire a ﬁrst-principles electronic description only in the
vicinity of the active site, while the rest of the system
can be treated by means of classical force ﬁelds. There-
fore, hybrid schemes that combine quantum and classical
mechanical descriptions in diﬀerent spatial regions38 are
appropriate for these situations and, in conjunction with
the present methodology, constitute a general computa-
tional approach appropriate for studying the eﬀects of
nuclear delocalization in the above situations. In fact, an
insight into the problem of quantum hydrogen-bonding
in water has already appeared in the literature39, thus
signalling the time for a new and exciting area of multi-
disciplinary research.

FIG. 1. A schematic representation of a potential energy
surface with two minima separated by a barrier. Dashed lines
represent diﬀerent possible values of the zero-point-energy
(ZPE): (a) ZPE is larger than the barrier (resonant regime),
(b) ZPE is between the bottom of the higher well and the
top of the barrier (tunneling regime), (c) ZPE is below the
bottom of the higher well (classical regime).

FIG. 2. The single isomer of Li4 (left panel), and the four
isomers of Li+
5 (right panel). Isomer IV is the most stable,
followed by isomer III. Isomers I and II are quite higher in
energy, and are almost degenerate.

FIG. 3. Dependence of the energetics of Li clusters on the

size of the basis set (BS). BS are ordered in increasing size.

FIG. 4. Pair correlation functions g(r) for Li4. The upper
panel shows the classical results for temperatures of 50 (solid
line), 100 (dashed line), and 200 (dotted-dashed line) K. The
lower panel shows the quantum (dashed line) and classical
(solid line) results for T = 50 K.

FIG. 5. Pair correlation functions g(r) for Li+

5 . The up-
per panel shows the classical results for temperatures of 50
(solid line), and 100 (dashed line) K. The lower panel shows
the quantum (dashed line) and classical (solid line) results for
T = 50 K. The insets show the partial g(r) for two groups
of atoms, one forming the central triangle and the other con-
sisting of the two external atoms.

FIG. 6. Distribution of HOMO and LUMO one-electron
eigenvalues for Li+
5 . The upper panel shows the classical re-
sults for temperatures of 50 (solid line), and 100 (dashed line)
K. The lower panel shows the quantum (dashed line) and
classical (solid line) results at T = 50 K.

FIG. 7. Root-mean-square of the imaginary-time corre-
lation function for Li4 at 50 K plotted versus k (with
0 ≤ k = β¯h/P ≤ β¯h), averaged over atoms 1 and 2 (lower
curve), and over atoms 3 and 4 (upper curve). P is the Trotter
number, 8 in this case.

Abstract

The self-organized Monte Carlo simulations of 2D
Ising ferromagnet on the square lattice are per-
formed. The essence of devised simulation method
is the artiﬁcial dynamics consisting of the single-
spin-ﬂip algorithm of Metropolis supplemented by
the random walk in the temperature space. The
walk is biased to the critical region through the
feedback equation utilizing the memory-based ﬁl-
tering recursion instantly estimating the energy cu-
mulants. The simulations establish that the peak
of the temperature probability density function is
located nearly the pseudocritical temperature per-
taining to canonical equilibrium. In order to elim-
inate the ﬁnite-size eﬀects, the self-organized ap-
proach is extended to multi-lattice systems, where
feedback is constructed from the pairs of the in-
stantaneous running fourth-order cumulants of the
magnetization. The replica-based simulations indi-
cate that several properly chosen steady statistical
distributions of the self-organized Monte Carlo sys-
tems resemble characteristics of the standard self-
organized critical systems.

Introduction

The Monte Carlo (MC) simulation methods are
nonperturbative tools of the statistical physics de-
veloped hand in hand with increasing power of
nowadays computers. The benchmark for testing
of MC algorithms represents the exactly solvable
Ising spin model [1]. Between algorithms applied
to diﬀerent variants of this model, the using of the
single-spin-ﬂip Metropolis algorithm [2, 3] prevails
due to its simplicity. Nevertheless the principal
problems have emerged as a consequence of the
accuracy and eﬃciency demands especially for the
critical region.

As a consequence of this several methods en-
hancing MC eﬃciency have been considered.

The procedures of great signiﬁcance are: ﬁnite-
size-scaling relations and renormalization group
based algorithms [4]
[7], cluster algorithms
-
[8, 9]
lowering the critical slowing down, his-
togram and reweighting techniques [10] interpolat-
ing the stochastic data, and multicanonical ensem-
ble methods [11] overcoming the tunneling between
coexisting phases at 1st order transitions. Even
with the mentioned modiﬁcations and related MC
versions, a laborious and human assisted work is
needed until a satisfactory accuracy of results is
achieved. This is trivial reason why utilization of
the self-organization principles have attracted re-
cent attention of MC community.

In the present paper we deal with the combin-
ing of the self-organization principles and MC dy-
namics. Of course, this eﬀort has a computational
rather than physical impact. Our former aim was
to design the temperature scan seeking for the po-
sition of the critical points of the lattice spin sys-
tems. But this original aim has been later aﬀected
by the general empirical idea of the self-organized
criticality (SOC) [12], originally proposed as a uni-
fying theoretical framework describing a vast class
of systems evolving spontaneously to the critical
state. The SOC examples are sand pile, forest-ﬁre
[13] and game-of-life [14] models. The SOC prop-
erty can be deﬁned through the scale-invariance of
the steady state asymptotics reached by the proba-
bility density functions (pdf’s) constructed for spa-
tial and temporal measures of dissipation events
called avalanches. The dynamics of standard SOC
systems is governed by the speciﬁc nonequilibrium
critical exponents linked by the scaling relations
[15] in analogy to standard phase transitions.

Notice that dynamical rules of standard SOC
systems are functions of the microscopic param-
eters uncoupled to the global control parameters.
On the contrary, in the spin systems governed by
the single-spin-ﬂip Metropolis dynamics, the spins
are ﬂipped according to prescriptions depending
on their neighbors, but also on the global or ex-
ternal control parameters, like temperature or se-
lected parameters of the Hamiltonian. The modiﬁ-

cation, by which the MC spin dynamics should be
aﬀected to mimic the SOC properties, is discussed
in [16]. In agreement with [17], any such modiﬁca-
tion needs the support of nonlinear feedback mech-
anism ensuring the critical steady stochastic state.
It is clear that the feedback should be deﬁned in
terms of MC instant estimates of the statistical av-
erages admitting the deﬁnition of critical state.

The real

feedback model called probability-
changing cluster algorithm [22] was appeared with-
out any reference to the general SOC paradigm.
The alternative model was presented in [18], where
temperature of the ferromagnet Ising spin system
was driven according to recursive formula corre-
sponding to general statistical theory [19]. This ex-
ample was based on the mean magnetization lead-
ing to series of the temperature moves approach-
ing the magnetic transition. Despite the success in
the optimized localization of critical temperature
of the Ising ferromagnet, the using of term SOC
seems to be not adequate for this case. The reason
is the absence of the analysis of spatio-temporal as-
pects of MC dynamics, which can be considered as
a noncanonical equilibrium [20, 21], due to residual
autocorrelation of the sequential MC sweeps.

Regarding the above mentioned approaches, the
principal question arises, if the MC supplemented
by feedback, resembles or really pertains to branch
of the standard SOC models which are well-known
from the Bak’s original paper [12] and related
works.

The plan of our paper is the following. Sec.2 is
intended to generalization of the averaging relevant
for the implementation of the self-organization
principles. The details of feedback construction
based on the temperature gradient of speciﬁc heat
are discussed in Sec.3. These proposals are sup-
plemented by the simulation results carried out for
2D Ising ferromagnet. The details of the multi-
lattice self-organized MC simulations, stabilizing
true critical temperature via fourth-order magne-
tization cumulants, are presented in Sec.4. The
oversimpliﬁed mean-ﬁeld model of self-organized
MC algorithm is discussed in Sec.5. Several univer-
sal aspects of the self-organized MC dynamics are
outlined by replica simulations in Sec.6. Finally,
the conclusions are presented.

2 The running averages

As we already mentioned in introduction, the
mechanism by which many body system is at-
tracted to the critical (or pseudocritical) point
should be mediated by the feedback depending on
the instantaneous estimates of the statistical av-

To attain the critical region self-adaptively we con-
struct the temperature dependent feedback chang-
ing the temperature in a way enhancing extremal
ﬂuctuations. The running estimates of averages
are necessary to predict (with share of the uncer-
tainty) the actual system position and the course
in the phase diagram leading to critical point.

The pseudocritical temperature Tc(N ) of some
ﬁnite system consisting of N degrees of freedom is
deﬁned by the maximum C(N, Tc(N )) of the spe-
ciﬁc heat C(N, T ). To form an attractor nearly
Tc(N ), we propose the following dynamics of the
temperature random walker

biased by the gradient

where C is MC estimate of the speciﬁc heat. From
that follows that the energy ﬂuctuations are con-
trolled by the temperature representing the addi-
tional slowly varying degree of freedom. It is as-
sumed here and in further that Tt remains con-
stant during N random microscopic moves (1MC
step per N ). The sign function occurring in Eq.(9)
is used to suppress the extremal ﬂuctuations of
F C
t causing the unstable boundless behavior of Tt.
From several preliminary simulations it can be con-
cluded that the replacement of sign function by
some smooth diﬀerentiable function (e.g. tangent
hyperbolic or arcus tangent) seems to be irrele-
vant for keeping of smaller dispersion of Tt. The
non-constant temperature steps are constrained by

temperature. Here Tt is the temperature for which
the last sample At,Tt = A(Xt) is calculated.

For later purposes we also introduce the zero
passage time τA pertaining to A. The time is de-
ﬁned as a measure of the stage during which the
sign(At) is invariant. More formal deﬁnition of τA
requires the introducing of two auxiliary times t′,
t′′. The ﬁrst time t′ deﬁnes the instant, where

At′−1 At′

At′+t′′−1 At′+t′′ > 0 ,

In this section we try to avoid the problem of ﬁnite-
size-scaling related to true equilibrium critical tem-
perature Tc and critical exponents. The problem
is solved by the multi-lattice self-organized simu-
lations based on the dynamical rules treating the
information from running averages of magnetiza-
tion. The considerations are addressed to models,
where 2nd order phase transitions take place. The
proposal is again applied to 2D Ising ferromagnet
on the square lattice.

6 The comparison of MC and

SOC dynamics.

In the section we discuss the universal aspects of
the non-equilibrium self-organized MC dynamics
applied to the canonical Ising model. As is already
mentioned, the attributes of the SOC systems are
avalanches reﬂected by the power-law pdf distribu-
tions. We follow with the construction of certain
temporal characteristics by supposing their uncer-
tain links to avalanches. By using Eqs.(12)-(14)
the evolution of any quantity can be mapped to
the sequence of passage times. The example of
this view represents pdf of τF C depicted in Fig.2.
Because of the substantial diﬀerence in the expo-
nents of pdf’s belonging to τF C and τF U , no uni-
versality attributes are indicated. More encour-
aging should be to ﬁnd of pdf’s independent of
the feedback type. The natural way toward this
aim seems to be the investigation of the passage
time sequences linked to the order parameter of
the canonical equilibrium of given system. In the
case of the Ising model the ordering is described
by the magnetization, or, eventually by isolated
spin value. Therefore, it seems to be logical to
deﬁne the passage times τm, τs given by Eqs.(12)-
(14) (corresponding to A = mL, si, where i is the
arbitrary but ﬁxed site position). The simulation
results are depicted in Fig.6.
In their structure,
the following attributes relevant for interpretation
in terms of SOC can be identiﬁed:

(I) the power-law behavior

racy) indistinguishable for pdf’s taken for se-

expresses invariance of si during (τs −
ﬂips, and its immediate change after the τ th spin
ﬂip occurring with probability p of the random
picking of ith site. The simulations carried for
paramagnet T
Tc depicted in Fig.7 agree with
formula Eq.(34). Below Tc pdf splits into separable
contributions ﬁtted here by the bimodal distribu-
tion Pτs = b0Pτs(p0) + b1Pτs(p1) with parameters
b0 = 0.003, b1 = 0.004, p0 = 0.61, p1 = 0.02. The
supplementary analysis of statistics of the succes-
sive time diﬀerences of mL recovers that b1Pτs(p1)
term originates from the mechanism of the long-
time tunneling among nearly saturated states of
the opposite polarity. From the ﬁgure it also fol-
lows that power-law short-time regime described
by Eq.(33) is formed only if the feedback mech-
anism is activated. This conditional occurrence
of universality can be considered as an additional
(IV)th attribute relevant for identiﬁcation of SOC.
The noncanonical equilibrium attained by the self-
organized MC dynamics for L = 10 leads to Pτs
dependence, which can be approximated by the ﬁt

Pτs = b2 τ −φ

It should be noticed that there remains the prin-
cipal problem of the link between SOC and pre-
sented self-organized MC method focused to the
critical region. The problem is to identify the spe-
ciﬁc algorithmic segment which should be inter-
preted as an analogue of a disturbance initializing
the avalanche. Fortunately, the advanced MC ap-
proach exists through which a disturbance can be
absorbed into MC algorithm with minor violation
of the original dynamics. In general, the approach
of interest based on the coevolution of given sys-
tem and its replica is known under the term dam-
age spreading technique [25]. To apply it, let us
consider the self-organized MC referential system
}t, which incorporates instant cu-
labeled here as

sality are indicated, the standard SOC paradigm
can be considered as a framework adaptable for
the analysis of the suggested self-organized MC dy-

Several versions of MC algorithm combining the
self-organization principles with the MC simula-
tions have been designed. The substantial feature
of method is the establishing of running averages
coinciding with gamma ﬁltering of the noisy MC

signal. The simulations are combined with the
mean-ﬁeld analysis describing the motion of tem-
perature near to magnetic transition point. The
replica-based simulations indicate that pdf distri-
butions of passage times in a noncanonical equilib-
rium attain the interval of the power-law behav-
ior typical for the standard SOC pdf distributions.
We hope that the present contribution will stimu-
late further self-organized studies of diverse lattice
models, e.g. those related to percolation problem.

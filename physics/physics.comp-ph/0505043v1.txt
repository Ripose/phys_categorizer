Abstract

The needs of various accelerator and space projects stimulated recent developments to the MARS
Monte Carlo code. One of the essential parts of those is heavy ion ionization energy loss. This paper
describes an implementation of several corrections to dE/dx in order to take into account the deviations
from the Bethe theory at low and high energies as well as the effect of a ﬁnite nuclear size at ultra-
relativistic energies. Special attention is paid to the transition energy region where the onset of the effect
of a ﬁnite nuclear size is observed. Comparisons with experimental data and NIST data are presented.

ABSTRACT

The needs of various accelerator and space projects stimulated recent developments to the MARS
Monte Carlo code. One of the essential parts of those is heavy ion ionization energy loss. This paper
describes an implementation of several corrections to dE/dx in order to take into account the
deviations from the Bethe theory at low and high energies as well as the effect of a ﬁnite nuclear size at
ultra-relativistic energies. Special attention is paid to the transition energy region where the onset of
the effect of a ﬁnite nuclear size is observed. Comparisons with experimental data and NIST data are
presented.

INTRODUCTION

The MARS code [1] is developed for detailed Monte Carlo modeling of hadronic and
electromagnetic cascades in realistic geometry for various accelerator, shielding, detector and
space applications. The recent needs of the Rare Isotope Accelerator, Relativistic Heavy-Ion
Collider, Large Hadron Colider, and NASA projects was a stimulus to implement heavy-ion
collision and transport physics into the MARS15 code [2]. The present paper describes in detail
the ionization energy loss formalism employed in the code along with comparisons to
experimental data and some recommended data. Radiative energy loss of heavy
ions—bremsstrahlung and e+e− pair production—is described elsewhere. The ionization loss is
of importance for correct prediction of radiation-induced effects, e.g. single-event upsets, in
microelectronic devices. The lower energy limit in our stopping power model is equal to 1 keV
per nucleon.

2 FORMALISM OF IONIZATION LOSS THEORY

In our model we distinguish three energy regions. Below 1 MeV per nucleon and above 10
MeV per nucleon the tabulated data on proton total stopping power from Ref. [3] and the Bethe
formalism, respectively, are used in combination with all the corrections described below.
Between the two energies, a mix-and-match procedure is used to perform an interpolation
between the approaches. It should also be noted that the 10-MeV limit is identical to the one used
when considering the ion effective charge (see below) and should be adjusted for some target
nuclei to get better appearance of the ionization loss distributions.

2.1 Bethe Theory

Bethe expression [4]

The mean ionization energy loss of charged particles heavier than electrons is given by the

where A and Z are the target atomic mass and number, respectively, and the other variables have
their usual meaning. The ionization logarithm, L(β), is presented in the following form:

δ

where I and δ are the mean excitation energy and density correction, respectively. When
neglecting all the corrections ∆Li and dealing only with the L0(β), the expression (1) is referred
to as the Bethe equation. The corrections ∆Li described below are to take into account the
deviations from the Bethe theory for ions at both low and high energies.

2.2 Lindhard-Sørensen Correction

Lindhard and Sørensen derived a relativistic expression for electronic stopping power of
heavy ions taking into account a ﬁnite nuclear size [5]. They used the exact solution to the Dirac
equation with spherically symmetric potential which describes scattering of a free electron by an
ion. Thus, their expression, ∆LLS, provides for the corrections of order higher than z2 to
ionization loss of heavy ions in both low and high energy regimes. At high energies the
Lindhard-Sørensen (LS) correction replaces the previously developed Mott correction and
relativistic Bloch-Ahlen one, while at low energies ∆LLS reduces to the Bloch non-relativistic
correction [6].

At moderately relativistic energies (see below) the following expression derived for

point-like ions is valid:

where η = αz/β, δk is a relativistic Coulomb phase shift expressed with the argument of the
complex Gamma function (for details see Ref. [6]), and k is a parameter used in the summation
over partial waves. At higher energies, when γmecR
modiﬁcation to the Coulomb phase shifts due to a ﬁnite nuclear size is not negligible and the
expression for ∆LLS gets more complicated from computational standpoint. At ultra-relativistic
energies, when γmecR

In our model the expressions (4) and (5), valid for moderately relativistic and ultra-relativistic

energies, respectively, are employed. In the intermediate energy region we interpolate between
the two approaches using a mix-and-match procedure.

2.3 Low-Energy Corrections

2.3.1 Barkas correction

The Barkas effect, associated with a z3 correction to the stopping power, is well pronounced
at low energies. For example, for a 2-MeV proton in gold the effect is responsible for about 8% of
ionization energy loss [7]. The correction is due to target polarization effects for low-energy
distant collisions and can be accounted for by the following expression:

L0(β) + δ/2

(L0(β) + δ/2)

z
√Z

where V = βγ/α√Z . The function F (V ) is a ratio of two integrals within a Thomas-Fermi
model of the atom. In our model we follow the tabulations for the function from Refs. [6, 8].

2.3.2 Shell corrections

The original Bethe theory is valid when the velocity of the projectile is much higher than that

of electrons in target atoms. Shell corrections should be taken into account at lower projectile
velocities. The total shell correction can be presented in the following form [7, 9]:

(6)

∆Lshell =

where C is equal to CK + CL + ... and thus takes into account the contributions from different
atomic shells. For CK and CL we follow the asymptotic expressions and tabulations from
Refs. [10, 12] and [11, 12], respectively, derived with hydrogen-like wave functions. For all the
other atomic shells, up to a combined O
Bichsel [9] are employed. It is assumed in the scaling that the corrections for the outer shells have
the dependence on the projectile velocity similar to that of the outermost shell studied with exact
calculations, i.e. L shell in our case.

2.3.3 Projectile effective charge

At low projectile velocities, the effect of electron capture and loss due to interactions with
target atoms should be taken into account as well. At present, the projectile charge distributions
that cover a more or less noticeable range of ions, targets, and velocities are not available.
Therefore one can deal with various empirical and semi-empirical ﬁtting expressions for the
average or, in other words, effective charge, zef f . The effective charge is to replace the bare
projectile charge in all the relevant expressions.

4

For protons and other singly charged particles the effective charge is assumed to be equal to

the bare charge down to the lower energy limit of the model, 100 keV/A. For α-particles a special
ﬁt by Ziegler et al. [13] independent of target material is used at all particle energies, E.

For some target nuclei, however, it is necessary to adjust the upper energy limit to get the stopping
power curves with better, without sharp transitions, appearance.

Calculated ratios of ion effective charge to bare charge are presented in Fig. 1. The effect of

neutralization of the bare projectile charge with captured electrons increases with the target
atomic number, being almost negligible for α-particles at energies above a few keV per nucleon.

deviations from the Bethe theory due to the above-mentioned corrections, except for the shell
corrections, increase with projectile charge, z, at both low and high energies. Therefore, the
comparisons for super-heavy ions are interesting and important most of all.

At relativistic energies a comparison to experimental data is presented in Fig. 3 for a dozen of

projectile-target combinations. One can make the following conclusions from the Figure: (i) the
LS correction in this case provides for an agreement with experimental data within 2%; (ii) the
above-mentioned combination of relativistic Bloch, Mott, and Ahlen (BMA) corrections gives
rise to a systematic underestimation of ionization loss (2-3% for Xe ions) when compared to the
LS approach; (iii) the difference between the BMA and LS approaches increases with projectile
charge. This conﬁrms that the Lindhard-Sørensen theory is correctly chosen.

A comparison to experimental data for super-heavy ions of lead and uranium is given in
Fig. 4. One can see that the employed mix-and-match procedure provides for a good, within 10%,
agreement with experiment at low energies. For uranium ions the density effect is well seen at

ultra-relativistic energies—the highest ionization loss is observed for the target of the lowest
density, i.e. gaseous argon. For lead ions at ultra-relativistic energies the effect of ﬁnite nuclear
size, that gives rise to a saturation of ionization loss instead of a logarithmic growth characteristic
of a pointlike projectile, is easily recognized. The experimental data at 160 GeV/u by Datz et al.
[17] corresponds to the highest energy achieved when accelerating heavy ions.

3.2 Comparison to NIST data

A comparison between the ionization loss calculated within the framework of the described

formalism and the data by NIST [3] is presented in Fig. 5 for protons and α-particles. The data of
Ref. [3] are given up to 104 MeV and 250 MeV/A for protons and α-particles, respectively. One
can see that the agreement between the MARS15 and NIST ionization loss is within 1.3% for
protons in the entire energy region. The agreement is somewhat better than that of MCNP5 [18]
where the difference is about 3% for the energy region from 4 up to 104 MeV, being more than

10% below 4 MeV.

For α-particles the biggest difference, about 10-15%, is observed below 400 keV/A. The
difference is comparable to the disagreement between theory and experiment in the energy region.
As far as the tabulated proton data of Ref. [3] are used below 1 MeV/A in our model, the
differences can be attributed to the description of effective charge of α-particles. Above 10 MeV
per nucleon the observed difference between the MARS15 and NIST ionization loss is about 1%.
One can see that approximately a half of the 1% is due to the difference in the description of the
proton ionization loss.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The various corrections to the Bethe mean ionization loss theory, as implemented in the
MARS15 Monte Carlo code, are described. The comparisons of calculated ionization loss to the
NIST published values reveal good overall agreement for protons and α-particles. The agreement
between the current model and experimental data is very good up to the super-heavy ions of lead
and uranium.

Experimental programs at many accelerator facilities cover wide energy regions. For
example, the Rare Isotope Accelerator is supposed to be operated at energies from a few keV/A
up to hundreds of MeV/A. To meet such practical demands, the developments are underway to
validate our model in the 1–100 keV/A region.

Since its release in 1999, the LHC experiments have been evaluating Geant4 in view of adopting it as a replace-
ment for the obsolescent Geant3 transport MonteCarlo. The ALICE collaboration has decided to perform a
detailed physics validation of elementary hadronic processes against experimental data already used in interna-
tional benchmarks. In one test, proton interactions on diﬀerent nuclear targets have been simulated, and the dis-
tribution of outgoing particles has been compared to data. In a second test, penetration of quasi-monoenergetic
low energy neutrons through a thick shielding has been simulated and again compared to experimental data.
In parallel, an eﬀort has been put on the integration of Geant4 in the AliRoot framework. An overview of the
present status of ALICE Geant4 simulation and the remaining problems will be presented. This document will
describe in detail the results of these tests, together with the improvements that the Geant4 team has made
to the program as a result of the feedback received from the ALICE collaboration. We will also describe the
remaining problems that have been communicated to Geant4 but not yet addressed.

1. ALICE detector

the internal structure of AliRoot is shown in ﬁgure 1.

ALICE [3], A Large Ion Collider Experiment, is
one of the four experiments that will run in the
LHC (Large Hadron Collider). Specially designed for
heavy-ion physics its main aim is to study the prop-
erties of strongly interacting matter at extreme en-
ergy densities, where the formation of the quark-gluon
plasma is expected.

2. Geant4

Geant4 [1] is the successor of the very popular and
successful simulation package Geant3 [2]. Geant4 has
been completely written in C++ using Object Ori-
ented technologies to achieve a greater degree of trans-
parency, ﬂexibility and extensibility. Its target appli-
cation areas include high energy physics, as well as
nuclear experiments, medical, accelerator and space
physics studies. Thanks to its rich set of physics pro-
cesses it is expected to supersede the Geant3 package,
which is not updated anymore.

3. ALICE Software

3.1. AliRoot

AliRoot is the ALICE oﬀ-line framework for sim-
ulation, reconstruction and analysis.
It uses the
ROOT [4] system as a foundation on which the frame-
work and all applications are built. For the simula-
tion both the actual transport code (see subsection
3.2) and the generators have been factorized into ab-
stract classes so that changing between all the possible
choices can be done very easily. A schematic view of

MOMT011

structure.

3.2. Virtual Monte Carlo

The Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC), thoroughly de-
scribed in another paper at this conference [5], is a
simulation framework developed within the ALICE
collaboration in close contact with the ROOT team. It
is based on the ROOT system and isolates the code
needed to perform a given detector simulation from
the real transport code that is used. Once the user
application is built, changing between any of the MCs
can be done by changing just one line of code in a
ROOT macro. Geant3 and Geant4 are currently fully
integrated in the VMC. The integration of FLUKA is
almost ﬁnished.

The VMC is now being integrated with the new,
more neutral and eﬃcient, Geometrical modeller de-

2

veloped for HEP by the ALICE Oﬄine project in a
close collaboration with the ROOT team. The native
geometry package in each MC is going to be replaced
with this new geometry package. Figure 2 shows the
structure of the experiment software framework based
on the VMC and the Geometrical Modeller.

3.3. ALICE Geant4 Simulation

At present, the ALICE simulation code based on the
VMC can be run with Geant4 including the geome-
try of all 12 subdetectors and all structure modules.
However, two detector subsystems are still excluded
from hits production: the ﬁrst one (ITS) since it uses
not yet supported “MANY” positions, and the sec-
ond one (RICH) because of a special requirement for
adding its own particles to the stack (not yet available
in the Geant4 VMC).

Runs of 5000 primary particles with the HIJING
parameterisation event generator (representing 5.8 %
of a full background event) and with the standard Ali-
Root magnetic ﬁeld map were performed. The kinetic
energy cuts equivalent to those in Geant3 simulations
were applied, using a special process and user limits
objects. The hit distributions in x and z distributions
were compared for all included subdetectors and for
Geant3 and Geant4. They were found to be compati-
ble.

4. Hadronic Benchmarks

4.1. Reasons

In the context of ALICE, Geant4 is considered as a
possible replacement for Geant3. The hadronic pro-
cesses are of capital importance for the physics that
will be studied in this detector.

Low momentum particles are of great concern for
the ALICE detectors covering the central rapidity
zone and the forward muon spectrometer since AL-
ICE has a rather open geometry with no calorimetry
to absorb particles and a small magnetic ﬁeld. At the
same time low momentum particles appear at the end
of hadronic showers. Residual background which lim-
its the performance in central Pb-Pb collisions results
from particles ”leaking” through the front absorbers
and beam-shield.

Therefore, we are performing a set of benchmarks
of the hadronic Geant4 processes against experimental
data.

4.2. Proton thin-target benchmark

The proton thin-target benchmark aims at es-
tablishing the capabilities of Geant4 to repro-
on nu-
duce
clei
in the so called intermediate energy range
(100 MeV < Elab < 1 GeV).

interactions

the

These studies were started with the release 3.0 of
the Geant4 code. During the running of the bench-
mark we experienced several problems including some
crashes of the program. They were reported to the
Geant4 team. In [8] we published the results obtained
with the oﬃcial release 3.2 . Our current revision

Figure 2: Schematic view of the experimental software
framework based on the VMC and the Geometrical
Modeller.

The Geant4 implementation of the VMC, the
Geant4 VMC, is completed and full simulation is posi-
ble even in complex geometries. Among the charac-
teristics in Geant4 VMC the following can be found:

• It is a layer between VMC and Geant4 indepen-

dent of the ALICE software.

• It provides an easy and tranparent transition
from a Geant3 based simulation to a Geant4
based simulation.

• It uses the G3toG4 package (included in Geant4
and developed with a substantial contribution
by ALICE), so it provides full support for reﬂec-
tions and limited support for Geant3 geometries
using “MANY” option.

• It has the capability to switch between the ROOT
user interface and the Geant4 user interface,
processing foreign commands or macros in both
UIs.

• It includes a Geant4 geometry browser.

• It has an XML export module.

The VMC examples, provided with the VMC [7],
allow comparisons between all the MC implementa-
tions. Besides, AliRoot is an example of the possible
use of the VMC concept in a complex HEP applica-
tion.

of these results was obtained with the latest release
available at the time of the conference: 5.0 with patch
1.

4.2.1. Experimental setup

The data used in this benchmark was collected
at Los Alamos National Laboratory (New Mexico,
USA) in the Weapons Neutron Research Facility. A
schematic representation of the experimental setup is
shown in Figure 3. A proton beam is directed towards
a thin target, therefore no more than one collision is
expected for most of the cases. The selected target
materials are aluminum, iron and lead. The proton
energies vary from 113 MeV to 800 MeV. Neutrons
are detected at several polar angles ranging from 7.5◦
to 150◦. A detailed description of the experiment can
be found in [9].

implementation of the model are claimed. As it
is a parameterized model, the nuclear fragments
remaining from the inelastic collision are not
calculated. To be able to verify the model we
have deduced the fragment properties from the
known conservation laws.

2. The second model used is the Geant4 im-
plementation of the precompound [11] model
(G4PreCompoundModell class).
It is a micro-
scopic model which is supposed to complement
the hadron kinetic model in the intermediate
energy region for nucleon–nucleus inelastic col-
lisions. From Geant4 release 5.0 a new in-
tranuclear cascade model is available in Geant4
(G4CascadeInterface class). The latest stud-
ies were done with this model activated in our
code.

4.2.2. Geant4 simulation

Due to the low hadronic interaction cross section,
the probability of having a single interaction in a thin
target is small. Most of the times, the protons traverse
the target material without interacting. For this rea-
son, to speed up computation, a setup diﬀerent from
the real one was simulated with Geant4. A big box
made of the target material was built to make sure
that one hadronic interaction would take place. Only
transportation and proton inelastic processes (class
G4ProtonInelasticProcess) were activated. Imme-
diately after the interaction, the kinematic properties
of the secondaries produced were stored for further
analysis, and the next primary interaction was gen-
erated. The direction of each neutron produced was
compared with the position of the detectors in the
experimental setup.

Two physics models inside Geant4 were used for

this benchmark:

MOMT011

The ﬁrst exercise that we did consisted in a set of
consistency checks, namely conservation laws and az-
imuthal distributions.

There are four systems in the reaction: the incident
proton, the target nucleus, the emitted particles and
the residual fragments. Four fundamental conserva-
tion laws can be checked: Energy, momentum, charge
and baryon number. The parameterized model does
not generate a residual fragment making these checks
impossible. However the fundamental correlation laws
allow us to determine the energy and the momentum
of the of residual fragments, and hence the square of
its total mass, while barion and charge conservation
can give us the number of protons and neutrons in
the fragments. Performing the calculation, we found
that up to 1.5% of the events have unphysical states
with a residual having a negative number of protons
or neutrons (see table I or ﬁgure 4), or with a negative
value of M2.

Some violations of the conservation laws were ob-
served in the initially tested versions of Geant4, where
the precompound model had to be used alone (there
was no cascade model). They were solved and only
a small energy non-conservation remained, appar-
ently coming from the ﬁnal de-excitation phase of the
model. Surprisingly when adding the cascade model
available since the 5.0 release we observed that neither

parameterized model is not able to correctly reproduce
most of the distributions. The same applies to the

improves a lot the agreement between data and MC
(see ﬁgure 6), though some discrepancy still persists
for low incident energy and light targets (see ﬁgure 7).

4.3. Neutron transmission benchmark

Figure 5: Energy and momentum balance (i.e.

Azimuthal distributions had a known bug in the old
Geant3 implementation of GHEISHA. For this reason
we checked them for the parameterized and precom-
pound model ﬁnding several azymuthal asymmetries
in the ﬁrst versions of Geant4. The latest release cor-
rects all of them and the distributions are ﬂat as ex-
pected.

Here we describe a second benchmark on the neu-
tron transport inside iron and concrete in the very low
energy region (10 MeV < Elab < 100 MeV). For
this benchmark the 4.1 (patch 1) release of Geant4
was used.

4.3.1. Experimental setup

In this test we use the data coming from an interna-
tional benchmark [12] that took place at the TIARA
facility of JAERI.

43 MeV and 68 MeV protons bombard a 7Li target,
producing a quasi-monoenergetic source of 40 MeV
and 65 MeV neutrons. Iron and concrete shields of
diﬀerent widths were placed 401 cm away from the
neutron source. The neutron ﬂux was measured in
three diﬀerent positions on the horizontal direction:
at 0, 20 and 40 cm from the beam axis.

The details on how the neutron intensity and energy

spectra was measured can be found in [12].

4.3.2. Geant4 simulation

There are two main parts which deﬁne the Geant4
simulation: the deﬁnition of the geometry and the
choice of the appropriate set of active physic processes,
i.e. the so called physics list.

The full geometry of the experimental setup, as de-
scribed in the previous section was not implemented
for the simulation. A simpler instance (see ﬁgure 9)
was used. A block of the material being studied was
built at 401 cm from the source in the z direction,
inside a big vacuum hall. In order to measure the ﬂux

Geant4.

The energy and angular neutron spectra of the
source was simulated. For the energy, the distribution
obtained from the measures after the lithium target
was used. The input spectrum was reproduced accu-
rately.

A selection of the available processes was done in
order to match our physics requirements. The physics
list was divided in ﬁve major blocks:

trons.

2. Electromagnetic processes: The electromagnetic
processes were activated only for γ, e±, protons
and alpha particles. The processes activated
were, for all mentioned particles, multiple scat-
tering and ionization. For photons, the photo

6

ticular we notice how the transmission peak is overes-
timated by Geant4 and there seems to be an overes-
timation of the ﬂuency again around 15 MeV. These
diﬀerences might come from the simpliﬁed geometry
and further investigation is needed. See ﬁgures 10 and
11 for some results.

electric eﬀect, the Compton scattering, and the
γ conversion were added. Bremsstrahlung was
included for e± and e+ annihilation was included
for e+.

3. Hadronic elastic processes: These processes were
switched on for protons, neutrons, deuterons,
tritons and alphas only. The default low en-
ergy hadronic elastic model (class G4LEElastic)
was used alone, except for neutrons where its
limit of applicability was set to 19 MeV and
the more specialized high precision model (class
G4NeutronHPElastic) was also activated.

4. Hadronic inelastic processes: The same par-
in the previous block had these
ticles as
kind of processes activated.
The precom-
pound model was selected. For neutrons, the
cross-sections provided by the Geant4 class
G4NeutronInelasticCrossSection were used
together with the inelastic high precision model
below 19 MeV.

5. Other hadronic processes: These are only spe-
cial neutron processes like neutron ﬁssion and
neutron capture. The default models, together
with their high precision version for energies be-
low 19 MeV, were used.

4.3.3. Flux Estimation

The track length method was used to estimate the
ﬂux after the target. Three spheres of 5.08 cm ﬁlled
with vacuum were placed tangent to the target at
x = 0 cm, x = 20 cm and x = 40 cm, and y =0, being
z the axis of the beam perpendicular to the shielding.
For every neutron entering each sphere its entry point,
exit point, energy, E, and track length, ℓ(E), inside
the volume of the sphere (VS) is stored. The ﬂux in a
given energy interval, ∆φ(∆E), is then calculated as
the track length normalized with the sphere volume.
So for N events we have:

∆φ(∆E) =

ℓ(E)

P
Eǫ∆E

Vs · N

The ﬁnal quantity takes into account the intensity,
I, of the incident ﬂux, and is normalized with the
lethargy, L = ∆ log(E). Therefore, the ﬁnal quantity
studied becomes:

4.4. Conclusions

Two sets of experimental data on proton-thin tar-
get and neutron transmission experiments were used
to benchmark Geant4. During the exercise several in-
consistencies were found and reported to the Geant4
experts. This fact, together with the lack of some
models in the MC toolkit limited the precision with
which the experimental results could be reproduced.
Most of the problems are now corrected though it
seems there is still space for more improvement, spe-
cially in the energy-momentum conservation laws of
the recently added cascade model.

5. G4UIRoot

G4UIRoot [14] is a new Geant4 GUI built using
the ROOT libraries. It fully integrates into Geant4 and
brings together the strengths of the Geant4 user in-
terface and ROOT capabilities.

5.1. Motivations

Geant4 has already several GUIs (Xm, OPACS,
GAG). Nevertheless, none of them was found com-
pletely satisfactory. Xm is more a UI, and the fact
that uses Motif gave rise to several problems on dif-
ferent platforms. The OPACS GUI was diﬃcult to in-
tegrate in a program, and, though it seems extremely
customizable, working with it was not found comfort-
able. Java GAG was very user-friendly. However the
fact that it was written in Java made it slow.

On the other hand the growing ROOT community
feel comfortable with it and gets used to its particu-
lar way of interacting with the programs through the
C++ interpreter. This GUI aims at bridging both
worlds allowing at the same time access to the Geant4
sophisticated high level commands and to the code it-
self through the ROOT interpreter.

A capture of the main G4UIRoot window together
with some output windows can be seen in ﬁgure 12. It
is easy to realize that this GUI is highly inﬂuenced by
GAG. Its look and feel is similar, and, although many
enhancements have been added, the basic functional-
ity is common. GAG code was taken as a starting
point and showed very helpful.

5.2. Features

This GUI was constructed using the ROOT toolkit
and proﬁting from its GUI capabilities. It is fully inte-
grated into the Geant4 compilation framework. Some
of its features are:

MOMT011

• Command tree: The full command tree can be
inspected in a tree-like structure where the avail-
ability of the commands is clearly marked and
updated according to the Geant4 state.

• Direct command typing: Commands may be ex-
ecuted by directly typing them in a space at the
bottom of the main window. This is very much
like the normal Geant4 user interface with some
extensions (tabbing, history). Typing a com-
mand here updates the selection in the com-
mand tree.

• Parameters frame: The list of parameters for a
given selected command is displayed in a frame
with the default values and the possibility of
modifying them.

• Command help: The full command help is also
displayed in the parameters frame and the short
command help appears in pop-up windows and
the status bar.

• Main window customization: Pictures and titles
in the main window may be customized. Geant4
also provides a way to add new menus to access
already registered Geant4 commands.

• Access to external Geant4 macros and ROOT

TBrowser.

• Output windows: Normal and error output are
shown in diﬀerent windows with saving capabil-
ities.

• History: History is logged to another window
and may be saved. It may also be recalled at
any point from the command line.

• ROOT interpreter: The terminal from which the
application is launched runs the typical ROOT in-
terpreter. It provides run-time access to the ob-
jects for which the ROOT dictionaries were gener-
ated (all ROOT objects and the user objects based
on the ROOT framework). For the time being,
this is not the case for Geant4 objects.

5.3. Conclusions

The ﬁrst version of G4UIRoot was developed in a
very short time thanks to both the good desing of
the ROOT GUI and the Geant4 interface categories.
A useful GUI for new-comers, people used to ROOT
and interactive users is now available.
It has most
of the capabilities of other Geant4 user interfaces and
some more extensions not found in any of them. Some
interest has been shown from other people and very
usefull contributions have been provided from some of
them.

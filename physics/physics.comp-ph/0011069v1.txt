A fast and stable numerical method is formulated to compute the time evolution of a wave function
in a magnetic ﬁeld by solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. This computational method
is based on the ﬁnite element method in real space to improved accuracy without any increase of
computational cost. This method is also based on Suzuki’s exponential product theory to aﬀord an
eﬃcient way to manage the TD-Schr¨odinger equation with a vector potential. Applying this method
to some simple electron dynamics, we have conﬁrmed its eﬃciency and accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. FORMULATION

Conventionally, wave functions have been represented
as a linear combination of plane waves or atomic orbitals
in the calculations of the electronic states or their time
evolution. However, these representations entail high
computational cost to calculate the matrix elements for
these bases. The plane wave bases set is not suitable for
localized orbitals, and the atomic orbital bases set is not
suitable for spreading waves.

To overcome those problems, some numerical methods
adopted real-space representation to solve the time de-
pendent Schr¨odinger equation [1–4]. In those methods,
a wavefunction is descritized by grid points in real space
and the spatial diﬀerential operator is approximated by
the ﬁnite diﬀerence method (FDM). With those meth-
ods, some dynamic electron phenomena were simulated
successfully [7–9].

In the previous work [11], we have formulated a new
computational method for the TD-Schr¨odinger equation
by using some computational techniques such as, the
FDM, Suzuki’s exponential product theory [12–17], Cay-
ley’s form [6] and Adhesive operator. This method af-
forded high-stability and low computational cost.

In the ﬁeld of engineering, for example, numerical anal-
ysis of ﬂuid dynamics or of strength of macroscopic con-
structions, the ﬁnite element method (FEM) has been
widely and traditionally used for approximating the ap-
propriate partial diﬀerential equations. Recently, the
FEM has been found useful for the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation of electrons in solid or liquid mate-
rials [10].

In this paper, we have utilized the FEM for solving
the TD-Schr¨odinger equation as an extension of the pre-
vious work [11]. By using Cayley’s form and the FEM,
this method aﬀords high-accuracy without any increase
of computational cost. Moreover, we have formulated a
new eﬃcient method which manages the time evolution
of a wave function in a vector potential or in a magnetic
ﬁeld. These techniques are especially useful for simu-
lating dynamics of electrons in a variety of meso-scopic
systems.

In this section, we formulate a new method derived by
the FEM and a new scheme to manage a vector poten-
tial eﬃciently. Throughout this paper, we often use the
atomic unit ¯h = 1, m = 1, e = 1.

A. FEM for the TD-Schr¨odinger equation

First, we utilize the FEM for the time evolution of
a wave function in a one-dimensional closed system de-
scribed by the following TD-Schr¨odinger equation:

The FEM starts by smoothing the wavefunction
around a grid point. We smoothed ψ(x) around a grid
point xi by eq. (2), as illustrated in Fig. 1:

By substituting eq. (3) for eq. (2), ψ(x, t) is expressed

Using these notations, eq. (7) is expressed simply as

the following formula is obtained after some algebra:

ψ(t + ∆t) =

ψ(t) ,

(15)

as

ψ(x, t) = uai(x) ψi−1(t) + uoi(x) ψi(t) + ubi(x) ψi+1(t) ,

where uai(x), uoi(x) and ubi(x) are the base functions
deﬁned below:

Equation (11) is the ﬁnite element equation for this case.
It has been thought that the existence of the matrix
S is troublesome since the inverse of this matrix is re-
quired to obtain the time derivative of the wave function,
namely,

∂ψ(t)
∂t

i¯h

=

2m∆x2 S−1D ψ(t) .

(12)

However, we have found that this diﬀerential equation
is easily solved by using an approximation called Cayley’s
form. The formal solution of eq. (12) is given by,

ψ(t + ∆t) = exp

(16)

In this way, the solution of the partial diﬀerential equa-
tion, eq. (1) is computed by eq. (15) with the concept of
the FEM. It is quite a remarkable result that formula
eq. (15) is almost the same as the formula derived by the
FDM [11]. In this time evolution, the norm of the wave
function is exactly conserved since the time evolution op-
erator appearing in eq. (1) is strictly unitary. Moreover,
accuracy is dramatically improved without any increase
in the computational cost, as demonstrated in the next
section.

It is easy to extend this idea for two-dimensional
systems, since the time evolution operator in a two-
dimensional system is decomposed into a product of the
time evolution operators in one-dimensional systems [11].

Clearly S and D satisfy the following equation:

ψ(r, t + ∆t) =

where Dx and Dy are the ﬁnite diﬀerence matrices along
the x and y axes respectively, and their appearances are
the same as D deﬁned in eq. (9).

Moreover, we have found that the hybrid decomposi-
tion [17] is rather easy in this case. Note the following
identity:

B. Evolution in a magnetic ﬁeld

Though there are many interesting phenomena in a
magnetic ﬁeld, there has been no eﬃcient methods that
numerically manage the dynamics in a magnetic ﬁeld as
far as we know. We have improved our method to aﬀord
an eﬃcient way to solve the TD-Schr¨odinger equation
with a vector potential given as below

subjected to a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld along the z

straightforward. We adopt the following vector potential

The exponential of the magnetic ﬁeld just changes the
phase of the wave function, so it is very easy to compute.
Therefore, this method is adaptable to systems subjected
to a magnetic ﬁeld. The outline of the procedure for a

schematically described by Fig. 2.

by using the FEM. It is remarkable that in spite of the
improvement of accuracy, the computational cost does
not increase at all.

We demonstrate the cyclotron motion in the frame-
work of quantum mechanics. We have simulated the mo-
tion of a Gaussian wave packet in a uniform magnetic
force as illustrated in Fig. 5.

ventional methods. 256 computational grid points are allo-

is placed in the system, whose initial average location xo and

spectively.

A more perfect circular trace is observed by enlarging
the system or shortening the cyclotron radius to reduce
the eﬀect of the reﬂection. Figure 8 shows the result of
another simulation.

In the above, ℓ is a y coordinate where the pattern is
evaluated.

Figure 10 shows the result of this simulation for the
case of no magnetic ﬂux, Φ = 0. These data were taken
soon after the pattern appeared in order to prevent the
pattern from extra interference due to the reﬂected waves
from side walls. The interference pattern basically agrees
with the semi-classical one derived from eq. (44).

FIG. 9. The model system for the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect.
The shape of this system is rectangular. A double-slit lies
at the center. A magnetic ﬂux Φ goes through a wall lying
between the slits. 64 × 128 computational grid points are
allocated in the physical size 8a.u. × 16a.u. The initial wave-
function is set as a plane wave k in front of the double-slit.
The time slice is set as ∆t = 1/64a.u.

The vector potential is constructed as follows:

A(x, y) = (0, Ay(x), 0)T ; Ay(x) =

FIG. 10. The interference pattern observed in the back of
the double-slit and at the line y = ℓ = L/4 in a case of no
magnetic ﬂux, Φ = 0. The solid line indicates the numerical
result; the dashed line indicates the semi-classical one derived
from eq. (44).

Further, the results for the case of magnetic ﬂux
Φ = h/2e and Φ = h/e are shown in Figs. 11 and 12,
respectively. The patterns are observed to shift to the
right-hand side, and these behaviors also agree with the
semi-classical one. However, the patterns are diﬀerent
from the the semi-classical one in their details. This is of
course due to the quantum eﬀect.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have improved the computational method for the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation by utilizing the ﬁ-
nite element method and by formulating a new scheme
for a magnetic ﬁeld. We have found that by using the
FEM, the accuracy of the simulation is dramatically im-
proved without any increase in the computational cost.
We have also found that the new scheme is quite eﬃcient
for simulating systems in a magnetic ﬁeld.

This computational method is especially useful for sim-
ulating dynamics of electrons in a variety of meso-scopic
structures.

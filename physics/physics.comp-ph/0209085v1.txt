Abstract

This paper deals with the complex problem of how to simulate multiparticle con-

tacts. The collision process is responsible for the transfer and dissipation of energy

in granular media. A novel model of the interaction force between particles has

been proposed and tested. Such model allows us to simulate multiparticle colli-

sions and granular cohesion dynamics.

1. Introduction

Behaviours of granular materials have generated much interest in a lot of indus-

trial processes involving transport of particles and also in natural phenomena. The

key aspect in such media is how to model the interactions that may eventually take

place between the particles. The collision processes are responsible for the trans-

fer and dissipation of energy in granular materials. Moreover, the understanding

of interaction process is important in order to develop simulations and theoretical

1

studies. Discrete models much better simulate the collision process than contin-

uum models. We will focus on the molecular dynamics models in which takes

into account an expression for the repulsive force acting between the particles.

Particularly, we will analyse what happens with the multiparticle contacts. Mul-

tiparticle interactions occur when a particle contacts with surrounding particles.

Typical molecular dynamics models [1, 3] are valid for particle collisions being

independent from one another. Nevertheless, we observe opposite situation in be-

haviour of dense granular media especially for cohesive particles. In literature [6]

notices the lack of energy dissipation in molecular dynamics models. We will pro-

pose novel form of a force between contacting particles and we will investigate its

properties.

2. Modelling multiparticle interactions

We consider a set of spherical particles moving under optional extortion. We

neglect a particle rotation. Figure 1a shows situation when particles move without

any interactions. We describe a distinguished particle through its characteristic

radius ri, mass mi, position xi and linear speed ˙xi. Index i denotes a given particle

and varies from 1 to np, where np is a total number of particles. Typical equation

of motion for one particle without collision can be written as

mi¨xi =

Fl,

nc

X
l=1

(1)

where Fl is an optional force and nc notices a total number of the optional forces.

We can distinguish the force as: gravitational one, drag force, etc. Figure 1b

presents another situation, this means multiparticle collisions. We add to Eq (1)

2

a sum of collisional forces and we have

mi¨xi +

Pj =

Fl,

ndi

X
j=1 ∧j6=i

nc

X
l=1

where Pj is a collisional force acting between two particles. Temporary index j

denotes a particle contacting with the given particle i and ndi is a total number of

particles surrounding and contacting with the particle i. In the molecular dynamics

models, particles virtually overlap when a contact occurs. Let Cj be a point in

which two particles contact as shown on the detail A in Figure 1b. Let Π be

a plane tangent to colliding particles at the point Cj and ζj be a normal direction

to Π. We decompose the collisional force into Pj = Pξ j + Pη j + Pζ j, where Pζ j

is the force acting on the normal direction and Pξ j, Pη j are forces acting on the

tangent direction. In our considerations we neglect the tangent forces assuming

Pξ j = Pη j = 0. Here we present some examples of the normal force models

which are frequently applied ones in practical simulations. Cundall and Strack [1]

proposed the force being a linear combination of viscous and elastic terms

Pζ j = cj · ˙ζj + kj · ζj,

where kj is a stiffness of a spring whose elongation is ζj and cj is a damping

constant. According to the detail A presented in Figure 1b we deﬁne the virtual

overlap as

ζj = (rj + ri) · eζ j − (xj − xi) ,

and a unitary vector eζ j normal to Π

eζ j =

xj − xi
kxj − xik

.

As a remark, we want to comment that Eqs (3) and (6) are typical for binary col-

lisions. Several coefﬁcients cj and kj assumed as a function of normal restitution

coefﬁcient. In the case of multiparticle contacts we have to assume the same col-

lisional time which is not suitable for granular cohesion dynamics. Independently

on physical properties of granular materials, we cannot change surface properties

of contacting particles in above models. Therefore, we cannot perform simula-

tions taking into account the particles cohesion. The restitution coefﬁcient in-

forms us about some work of deformation between contacting bodies but does not

inform how much time is needed during particle collisions. In real behaviour of

moving particles we can easy change surface properties of granular materials. Es-

pecially, when we consider the interactions in a granular material for dry particles

and for wet ones. In crucial point of our discussion, we assume that momentum

and energy transfer between multiparticle contacts is identiﬁed by memory effect.

From the other hand, a given particle have to remember about surrounding par-

ticles during collision process. Using fractional calculus [5] and the generalised

viscoelastic model [7] we propose a novel form of the normal force

physical interpretation - especially when we try to introduce initial conditions -

we formulate another one fractional derivative

where the sum means initial conditions. We explain with details a meaning and

dependence between these two derivatives because many investigators have con-

centrated on the Riemann-Liouville derivative, but this is a lack in physical ap-

plications. Everywhere in the contact process, we numerically solve Eq (2) with

formula (7) together with Eq (10) by application the decomposition method de-

scribed in [4].

3. Computational results

To illustrate proﬁts of the force model given by formula (7) we compare its be-

haviour with the force models presented by Eqs (3) and (6). In this case we sim-

ulate a particle vertically falling down to a bottom plate as shown in Figure 2.

When performing this simulation, the particle falls under gravity (we used Eq (1))

and the contact occurs in the plate (we used Eq (2)). Figure 2 presents vertical dis-

placement of the particle over time. When the collision occurs, we apply different

schemes of the normal forces: continuous line represents the linear force (3),

dashed line shows the nonlinear one (6) and two dash-dot lines are responsible for

our formula (7). For determined physical properties of the particle and initial con-

ditions we observe very good agreement between our force model and the linear

one. In such case we establish the parameter α in Eq (7) α = 0.051. In the next

case we can see quite good agreement between our force model and the nonlinear

one when α = 0.19. We can simulate both cases changing the non-integer order

α in the fractional operator. In analysis of such behaviour we can observe that

the parameter α models the surface properties. When α = 0 we have an elastic

collision but α = 1 determines a viscous collision. We notice that the material

parameters like cj and kj in formula (7) are constant. Therefore, the fractional

order α is a surface parameter balancing between elastic and viscous properties

of two contacting bodies. Moreover, formula (7) is suitable for multiparticle con-

tacts. Figure 3 presents some behaviour of three particles in two dimensional

space when the parameter α changed from 0.01 to 0.9. Such simulation is so

far from reality because we neglect gravity force, tangential forces under particle

contacts and particle rotations. Thin lines represents particle trajectories but thick

6

lines are common trajectories when particles move like a one body. In the low val-

ues of α we do not observe common trajectories. When the parameter α increases

up to α = 0.9 we can see common trajectories of two or three particles in depen-

dence on mutual positions. We strongly notice that formula (7) is more ﬂexible to

model cohesion processes than other ones. Extending our considerations we ob-

serve different lengths of the common trajectories. This fact issues from different

begins of contacting times t∗

j between two interacting particles. Therefore we can

simulate multiparticle contacts in which we do not assume the same collisional

time.

4. Conclusions

We have proposed and discussed a novel model of the normal force used in sim-

ulations of the particle collisions. With this model, it is possible to simulate mul-

tiparticle contacts in which we do not assume the same collisional time. This

feature, in comparison to the linear and nonlinear force models is advantage of

some generalisation between particle interactions. However, some of the parame-

ters of this model may still be tuned, as for example, the parameter α in order to

reﬂect real surface properties of contacting particles.

X-ray Diﬀraction by Time-Dependent Deformed Crystals:

Theoretical Model and Numerical Analysis

Svetlana Sytova

Abstract

The objective of this article is to study the behavior of electromagnetic ﬁeld under
X-ray diﬀraction by time-dependent deformed crystals. Derived system of diﬀerential
equations looks like the Takagi equations in the case of non-stationary crystals. This is a
system of multidimensional ﬁrst-order hyperbolic equations with complex time-dependent
coeﬃcients. Eﬃcient diﬀerence schemes based on the multicomponent modiﬁcation of
the alternating direction method are proposed. The stability and convergence of devised
schemes are proved. Numerical results are shown for the case of an ideal crystal, a crystal
heated uniformly according to a linear law and a time-varying bent crystal. Detailed
numerical studies indicate the importance of consideration even small crystal changes.

1. Introduction

Mathematical modeling of X-ray diﬀraction by time-dependent deformed crystals refers
to physical problems of intensive beams passing through crystals. So, a relativistic electron
beam passes through the crystal target and leads to its heating and deformation. The system
of diﬀerential equations describing X-ray dynamical diﬀraction by non-stationary deformed
crystals was obtained in [1]. This system looks like the Takagi equations
[2]– [3] in the
[4]– [7]) the theory of X-ray
case of non-stationary crystals. Up to now in many ref. (e.g.
dynamical diﬀraction by stationary crystals for diﬀerent deformations was developed. Proper
systems of diﬀerential equations are stationary hyperbolic systems for two independent spatial
variables. In [4]– [7] the solutions of these systems were obtained analytically for some cases
[8] id devoted to numerical calculation of propagation of X-rays in stationary
of deformations.
perfect crystals and in a crystal submitted to a thermal gradient. In [9] the theory of time-
dependent X-ray diﬀraction by ideal crystals was developed on the basis of Green-function
formalism for some suppositions.

The exact analytical solution of the system being studied in this work is diﬃcult if not
impossible to obtain. That is why we propose diﬀerence schemes for numerical solution. To
solve multidimensional hyperbolic systems it is conventional to use diﬀerent componentwise
splitting methods, locally one-dimensional method, alternating direction method and others.
They all have one common advantage, since they allow to reduce the solving of complicated
problem to solving of a system of simpler ones. But sometimes they do not give suﬃcient pre-
cision of approximation solution under rather wide grid spacings and low solution smoothness
because the disbalancement of discrete nature causes the violation of discrete analogues of
conservation laws. The alternating direction method is eﬃcient when solving two-dimensional
parabolic equations. We use the multicomponent modiﬁcation of the alternating direction
method [10] which is devoid of such imperfections. This method provides a complete approx-
imation. It can be applied for multicomponent decomposition, does not require the operator’s
commutability. It can be used in solving both stationary and non-stationary problems.

Diﬀerence schemes presented allow the peculiarities of initial system solution behavior.
The problem of stability and convergence of proposed diﬀerence schemes are considered. We
present results of numerical experiments carried out. We compare eﬃciency of suggested
schemes in the case of diﬀraction by ideal stationary crystal. Tests and results of numerical
experiments are demonstrated in the case of heated crystal. In our experiments it is assumed
that the crystal was heated uniformly according to a linear law. The source of crystal heating
was not speciﬁed. It may be the electron beam passing through the crystal. In [1] we have
given the formulae which allow to determine the crystal temperature under electron beam
heating. We present also results of numerical modeling of X-ray diﬀraction by a time-varying
bent crystal. The source of crystal bending is not discussed too.

2. Theoretical Model of X-ray Dynamical Diﬀraction by
Time-Dependent Deformed Crystals

We will use the physical notation [11]. Let a monocrystal plane be aﬀected by some time-
varying ﬁeld of forces, which cause the crystal to be deformed. At the same time let a plane
electromagnetic wave with frequency ω and wave vector k be incident on this monocrystal
plane. We consider two diﬀerent diﬀraction geometry which are depicted in Figure.1. In the
case of Bragg geometry the diﬀracted wave leaves the crystal through the same plane that the
direct wave comes in. In Laue case the diﬀracted wave leaves the crystal through the back
plane of the crystal. The electromagnetic ﬁeld inside the crystal in two-wave approximation

is written in the form:

D(r, t) = D(r, t) exp(i(kr − ωt)) + Dτ (r, t) exp(i((k + τ )r − ωt)),

where D and Dτ are the amplitudes of electromagnetic induction of direct and diﬀracted
waves, respectively, and τ is the reciprocal lattice vector.

Let us examine a weakly distorted region in the crystal, where for the deformation vector

u(r, t) the following inequalities are correct:

u(r, t) is the crystal deformation tensor. uij = 1/2(∂ui/∂xj + ∂uj/∂xi). Let us call

To obtain an expansion in series of the reciprocal lattice vector let us pass to a new system
of coordinates S′: rd = r − u(r, t). Here in each ﬁxed instant of time the Bravais lattice of
deformed crystal is coincident with one of undistorted crystal in the system S. So, in the
system S′ the crystal structure is periodic. And it is disturbed in the system S.

Now in S′ for electric susceptibility ǫ we can write:

Or, ﬁnally restoring in the system S, we obtain:

ǫ(r; ω) =

ǫ((1 −

u)τ ; ω)exp(iτ dr),

ǫ(rd; ω) =

ǫ(τ d; ω)exp(iτ drd),

ǫ(r − u; ω) =

The diﬀerence between our system (2.1) and the Takagi equations [3] is in the term α,

which depends on time now, and in the appearance of the term s.

Let us rewrite the system (2.1) in the generalized form having picked out vectors of σ-
polarization from amplitudes of electromagnetic induction D and Dτ and having speciﬁed
three independent variables t, z, x. The spatial variable y is a parameter. One can write a
full three-dimensional system.

Initial and boundary conditions are written in the domain G = {(z, x, t), 0 ≤ z ≤ Lz, 0 ≤

x ≤ Lx, 0 ≤ t ≤ T }. In the Bragg case the boundary conditions are written as follows:

D(0, x, t) = D0,

Dτ (Lz, x, t) = 0,

0 ≤ x ≤ Lx,

t > 0.

(2.5)

In Laue geometry, where the diﬀracted wave leaves the crystal through the crystal back

plane, the boundary condition for amplitude Dτ should be written at z = 0.

As is known [11], the exact solution of the stationary X-ray diﬀraction problem has the

following form:

D = c1 exp(ikδ1z) + c2 exp(ikδ2z),
Dτ = c1s1 exp(ikδ1z) + c2s2 exp(ikδ2z),

(2.6)

where δ1, δ2 are the solutions of the dispersion equation:

(2δγ0 − χ0)(2δγ1 − α0 − χ0) − χτ χ−τ = 0;

2δiγ0 − χ0
χτ
γ0 and γ1 are the cosines of the angles between k and kτ , respectively, and the z axis;

i = 1, 2;

si =

s1e1(Lz) − s2e2(Lz)

,

c2 =

D0s1e1(Lz)
s1e1(Lz) − s2e2(Lz)

.

Here and below the following designations are used:

e1(z) = exp(ikδ1z),

e2(z) = exp(ikδ2z).

Let us impose initial conditions corresponding to the exact solution of the stationary

X-ray diﬀraction problem in an ideal crystal:

D(z, x, 0) = c1e1(z) + c2e2(z),
Dτ (z, x, 0) = c1s1e1(z) + c2s2e2(z),

0 ≤ z ≤ Lz,

0 ≤ x ≤ Lx.

In the X-ray range the amplitudes (2.6) oscillate with suﬃciently high frequency. For
large thickness of crystal it is complicated to obtain good numerical solutions of system (2.2)
with coeﬃcients (2.4). So, let us ﬁnd solution of (2.2) for functions D(z, x, t) and Dτ (z, x, t)
which vary more slowly than e1(z) or e2(z):

D(z, x, t) = D(z, x, t)(c1e1(z) + c2e2(z)),
Dτ (z, x, t) = Dτ (z, x, t)(c1s1e1(z) + c2s2e2(z)).

(2.7)

Then the coeﬃcients (2.4) have to be presented by the formulae:

Q11 = −0.5iω

χ0 − 2kz/k(c1δ1e1(z) + c2δ2e2(z))
c1e1(z) + c2e2(z)

,

Q12 = −0.5iωχτ

Q21 = −0.5iωχ−τ

c1s1e1(z) + c2s2e2(z)
c1e1(z) + c2e2(z)

,

c1e1(z) + c2e2(z)
c1s1e1(z) + c2s2e2(z)

,

Q22 = −0.5iω

χ0 − α(z, x, t) − s(z, x, t) − 2kτ z/k(c1s1δ1e1(z) + c2s2δ2e2(z))
c1s1e1(z) + c2s2e2(z)

.

(2.8)

The boundary conditions (2.5) take the form:

D(0, x, t) = 1,
Dτ (Lz, x, t) = 1,

0 ≤ x ≤ Lx,

t > 0.

(2.9)

For this case the initial conditions have to be equal to 1 too.

3. Numerical Analysis

The original diﬀerential problem is a system of multidimensional ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equa-
tions of hyperbolic type with complex-valued time-dependent coeﬃcients. The numerical
schemes employed in this work are based on the multicomponent modiﬁcation of the alter-
nating direction method. This method was originally developed in [10]. It turned out to be
an eﬀective way for eﬃcient implementations of diﬀerence schemes. This method is econom-
ical and unconditionally stable without stabilizing corrections for any dimension problems of
mathematical physics. It does not require spatial operator’s commutability for the validity
of the stability conditions. This method is eﬃcient for operation with complex arithmetic.
Its main idea is in the reduction of the initial problem to consecutive or parallel solution of
weakly held subproblems in subregions with simpler structure. That is why it allows us to
perform computations on parallel computers. The main feature of this method implies that
the grids for diﬀerent directions can be chosen independently and for diﬀerent components
of approximate solution one can use proper methods.

Let introduce the Hilbert space of complex vector functions: H = L2(G). In this space

the inner product and the norm are applied in the usual way:

(u, v) =

u(x)v(x)dx,

kuk = (u, u)1/2.

G

In H our system (2.2) is hyperbolic.

3.1. Eﬃcient Schemes for Solving Hyperbolic System in Two Space Dimensions

We use the following notation [12]:

yx = (yi+1 − yi)/hx — right diﬀerence derivative,

yx = (yi − yi−1)/hx — left one,

yi = y(xi);

yt = (

y − y)/ht,

y = y(tk+1),

y = y(tk).

Let us replace the domain G of the continuous change of variables by the grid domain

Gzxt = {(zi, xj, tk); zi = ihz, i = 0, 1, . . . , N1, N1 = [Lz/hz], xj = jhx, j = 0, 1, . . . , N2,

N2 = [Lx/hx], tk = kht, k = 0, 1, . . . , N3, N3 = [T /ht]}.

The following system of diﬀerence equations approximates on Gzxt the system (2.2) with

In cited schemes the directions of diﬀerence derivatives with respect to x (left or right)
are selected in dependence of waves directions. D1, D2, D1
τ are two components
of approximate solutions for D and Dτ , respectively. One can choose any of these two
components or its half-sum as a solution of (2.2). The boundary and initial conditions are
approximated in the accurate form.

In Laue case where the diﬀracted wave moves on a positive direction of the z axis, for Dτ

we should write left diﬀerence derivatives with respect to z.

The schemes (3.10)–(3.11) and (3.12) are completely consistent. The consistency clearly
follows from the manner in which these schemes were constructed. On suﬃciently smooth
solutions they are of the ﬁrst order approximation with respect to time and space. We can
give the diﬀerence scheme of the second order approximation with respect to z. In this case
it should be rewritten (3.10):

The scheme for the second component (3.11) is not changed.

One can write a scheme of the second order approximation with respect to time. But
as has been shown in numerical experiments it does not lead to sensible changes in solution
pattern.

For the diﬀerence schemes presented, the stability relative to initial data and also the
convergence of the diﬀerence problem solution to the solution of diﬀerential problem (2.2)
can be proved. This follows from the properties of the multicomponent modiﬁcation of the
alternating direction method [10]. Let us prove the corresponding Theorems.

Repeated application of this inequality to the right yields the estimate (3.16) for i = 1. ✷

We denote the discretization error as Z i = Di − D, i = 1, 2, where D is the exact solution

of initial diﬀerential problem.

Teorem 3.2. Let the diﬀerential problem (2.2)–(2.5) have a unique solution. Then
the solution of the diﬀerence problem (3.10)–(3.11) converges to the solution of the initial
diﬀerential problem as ht, hz, hx → 0. The discretization error may be written as

|Z i| ≤ O(ht + hz + hx).

Proof follows immediately from consistency of the scheme (3.10)–(3.11), Theorem 3.1

and Lax’s Equivalence Theorem [13]. ✷

The stability and convergence of schemes (3.12), (3.13)–(3.11) can be proved in an anal-

ogous way.

4. Results of Numerical Experiments

4.1. Diﬀraction by Ideal Crystal

The problem of studying of electromagnetic ﬁelds under X-ray diﬀraction inside the crystal
target is constituent of the problem of modeling intensive beams passing through crystals, X-
ray free electron laser and others. Therefore let analyze the operation of schemes (3.10)–(3.11)
and (3.12) in the case of ideal absorbing crystals.

Figure 2–5 display results of numerical experiments in the crystal of LiH. This crystal
was chosen because of small absorption. The design parameters were the following. The

frequency ω was equal to 1.7 · 1019sec−1. The diﬀraction plane indexes were (2, 2, 0). The
Bragg angle was equal to 0.39. The angle between the direct wave vector and the z axis was
equal to 0.83. This case corresponds to the total internal reﬂection region. We compare the
numerical results obtained with the analytical solution (2.6). On our ﬁgures this solution is
depicted by red curves. So, Figure 2 presents numerical results of the scheme (3.10)–(3.11)
for N1 = 100 and N1 = 200 respectively. From these plots we notice that the grid dimension
N1 = 100 gives good agreement with analytical results and N1 = 200 gives ideal agreement.
But for greater thickness of Lz = 0.3 cm only N1 = 200 gives a more or less acceptable ﬁt,
as is obvious from Figure 3.

Thus, for large thickness of crystal we will use the scheme (3.12) with coeﬃcients (2.8).
It is evident that the amplitudes D and Dτ from (2.7) should be equal to 1 after installation
of a stationary regime in the system in the case of an ideal crystal. Figure 4 demonstrates
the distinction between numerical results for N1 = 20 (curve 1), N1 = 50 (curve 2) and 1.
When N1 = 100 the agreement is ideal. For the amplitudes of diﬀracted waves we can show
similar ﬁgures. Figure 4 b) presents numerical and analytical solutions for the amplitudes of
direct wave when N1 = 50.

Let us clear up how the scheme (3.12) functions with coeﬃcients (2.3)-(2.4). Figure 5
gives an idea that in the case of oscillations of amplitudes this scheme operates badly even
for small thickness of crystal.

Let us show numerical results for the crystal of Si with small thickness Lz = 0.005
cm. They are more visual because the absorption coeﬃcient of Si is large. We have used the
following geometry parameters: the diﬀraction plane indexes are (2, 2, 0), ω = 6.9 · 1018sec−1.
The Bragg diﬀraction case was modeled with the Bragg angle equal to π/4. Figure 6 depicts
curves of amplitudes of direct and diﬀracted waves in comparison with analytical solution in
the ideal crystal (2.6) (red curves). Figure 7, a) represents comparison between results of
schemes (3.10)–(3.11) and (3.12) with coeﬃcients (2.4). As stated above, the simplest scheme

does not work well in our conditions. Figure 7, b) shows the behavior of two components
D1 and D2 of numerical solution. As may be seen from this ﬁgure, both of two components
converge well to the analytical solution. That supports once again our statements given
above.

4.2. Diﬀraction by Time-Dependent Heated Crystal

Let us compare obtained numerical results for the crystal heated to the temperature
T = T − T0 K with analytical solutions of the stationary linear X-ray diﬀraction problem in
crystal heated to T K. T0 is an initial temperature of the crystal. The source of crystal heating
and deformation was not speciﬁed. It was supposed that the crystal was heated uniformly
according to the linear law: T (t) = T0 + at, where a is the rate of heating. The data for
the stationary linear X-ray diﬀraction problem (χ0, χ±τ (T)) were obtained from the program
[14]. Let emphasize that only the values χ0 and χ±τ (T0) in numerical calculations by (3.10)–
(3.11) are needed. They can be taken from reference books or from the program [14]. While
computing the values of α and s from the coeﬃcient Q22 are recalculated depending on the
variation of the deformation vector u(z, x, t).

We demonstrate numerical results for the crystal of Si. Figure 8 depicts curves of ampli-
tudes of diﬀracted wave in the crystal of Si for the above parameters and T = 10 K (curves
1), T = 15 K (curves 2), T = 20 K (curves 3), respectively. The initial temperature T0 was
equal to 293 K. The heating rate a was equal to 5 · 1010 K/sec. The curves of each of pairs
of curves correspond to the numerical solution of the X-ray dynamical diﬀraction problem
in time-varying heated crystal and to the analytical solution of the stationary linear X-ray
diﬀraction problem in the heated deformed crystal. Figure 9 and Figure 10 show evolution of
direct and diﬀracted wave amplitudes under crystal heating to 100 K, respectively. Appar-
ently, up to T = 16 K the modulus of the amplitude of the diﬀracted wave coming out the

crystal at z = 0 decreases abruptly. This can be explain by the fact that under heating the
parameter α of deviation from the exact Bragg condition increases and diﬀraction disrupts.
Such an analysis of results demonstrates that proposed mathematical model and eﬀective
numerical algorithm allow to obtain distributions of electromagnetic waves amplitudes in
non-stationary crystals with suﬃcient precision.

4.3. Diﬀraction by Time-dependent Bent Crystal

Let us examine the following model of bent in time crystal. As before, we do not specify
the nature of bending (mechanic, temperature or other). We suppose that the crystal is bent
according to the law

(4.24) was obtained from the following

The parabola formula at the point z0 has the form:

(4.24)

(4.26)

The diﬀerence between (4.25) and (4.24) is the z component of the deformation vector
u(z, x, t). The component ux(z, x, t) can be derived from the formula:

where x0 is found from the curve distance formula

We have realized numerical experiments to ﬁnd out how crystal bending aﬀects the diﬀrac-
−1
tion pattern. We consider the crystal of Si with the rate of bending a = −2.5 · 106(cm sec)
.
Figure 12 illustrates evolution of diﬀraction at the point x = 0.1 cm. The pattern of distri-
bution of electromagnetic ﬁeld is similar to one under crystal heating. When moving to the
central point x = 0 of the crystal the magnitude of bending becomes smaller. The diﬀraction
pattern should be less changed. This fact was conﬁrmed during numerical experiments.

We considered simple models of crystal heating and bending. More accurate ones can
be taken, for example, from [15]. In [4]-[7] a general dynamical theory of X-ray diﬀraction
from a homogeneously bent stationary crystals was developed. But their analytical formulae
are complicated enough. That is why the analysis of numerical results obtained from our
program and their analytical results will be the aim of another paper.

5. Summary

Presented diﬀerence schemes and numerical algorithms allow to examine waves amplitudes
evolution in non-stationary crystals with suﬃciently precision. Numerical calculations show
that even small non-stationary crystal deformations lead to considerable changes in the
diﬀraction pattern. So, mathematical model and numerical method presented can be used in
mathematical modeling of intensive beams passing through crystals.

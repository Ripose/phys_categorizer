ABSTRACT
There are many interesting physical processes which involve the generation of high density plasmas
in large volumes. However, when modeling these systems numerically, the large densities and volumes
present a signiﬁcant computational challenge. One technique for modeling plasma physics, the particle in
cell (PIC) approach, is very accurate but requires increasing computation time and numerical resolution
as the density of the plasma grows. In this paper we present a new technique for mitigating the extreme
computational load as the plasma density grows by combining existing PIC methods with a dielectric
ﬂuid approach. By using both descriptions in a hybrid particle-ﬂuid model, we now can probe the
physics in large volume, high density regions. The hybrid method also provides a smooth transition as
the plasma density increases and the ionization fraction grows to values that are well described by the
ﬂuid description alone. We present the hybrid technique and demonstrate the validity of the physical
model by benchmarking against a simple example with an analytic solution.

INTRODUCTION

Particle in cell (PIC) methods enjoy great success in
modeling devices that include moderately dense plasmas.
However, as the plasma density becomes high in a large
volume, the number of particles to track becomes compu-
tationally prohibitive. Reducing the number of particles
by creating larger “macro particles” introduces unaccept-
able numerical error. Alternatively, high density plasmas
in large volumes can be modeled using a dielectric ﬂuid
description. This requires integrating over the time de-
pendent distribution function of electrons in the plasma,
which for computational simplicity is often assumed to be
well approximated by a Maxwellian. However, this is not
accurate for characterizing the formation of very dense
plasmas, where often times the distribution function is not
entirely known. For example, some physical processes such
as air breakdown phenomena involve energy distributions
that are partially Maxwellian but include a long, high en-
ergy tail. The particles in the high energy tail are those
responsible for the majority of interactions that lead to a
qualitative change in physical behavior (Nicholson 1983).
Thus, a ﬂuid description that neglects the high energy
tail fails to capture the physics of interest. We propose
a hybrid plasma description that simultaneously employs
the ﬂuid and PIC treatments which has the potential to
capture the relevant physics in a tractable computational
time.

In addition to reducing the number of particles that
must be tracked by the PIC treatment, the particle-ﬂuid
hybrid approach also allows computations to be performed
on a much coarser grid while preserving the physics.
In general, explicit PIC computations become inaccurate
when the resolution of the grid becomes comparable to the
Debye length of the plasma. In the hybrid scenario, how-
ever, the size of the grid need only be comparable to the
Debye length of the partial-plasma comprised of the parti-
cles in the high energy tail. Since the Debye length varies

inversely as the √density, and the high energy tail contains
only a small fraction of the total density, the grid reso-
lution can be signiﬁcantly reduced. The grid resolution
requirements are determined by the Debye length of the
partial-plasma and by the length scale required to resolve
the spatial gradients in the dielectric ﬂuid treatment. The
division criterion used to separate the plasma into parti-
cles and ﬂuid will determine which of these conditions will
require the greater resolution.

In the hybrid description we use a ﬂuid model for parti-
cles that fall within a Maxwellian energy distribution, and
PIC for particles in the high energy tail. We have added a
dielectric ﬂuid description of a plasma to the Improved
Concurrent Electromagnetic Particle In Cell (ICEPIC)
code (Birdsall & Langdon 1985; Luginsland & Peterkin 2002).
To ensure physical accuracy the PIC and ﬂuid descriptions
are tested independently. A test problem with a simple
analytic solution is used to benchmark the performance of
the particle, dielectric ﬂuid, and particle-ﬂuid hybrid treat-
ments. All three approaches are shown to properly repro-
duce the correct dispersion relation when electromagnetic
plane waves are launched through a 2-D box containing
hot or cold plasma.

2. METHOD

2.1. The Particle In Cell (PIC) treatment

ICEPIC computes the time advance of the magnetic
ﬁeld according to Faraday’s law, and the electric ﬁeld ac-
cording to Ampere-Maxwell’s law. The discreet form of
these equations used in ICEPIC are designed to preserve
E = ρ/ǫ0 as long
the constraint equations
as the initial data satisﬁes these constraints. The particles
used in ICEPIC are “macro-particles” that represent many
charged particles (electrons and/or ions) with a position
vector x and a velocity vector v = dx/dt. The relativistic
form of Lorentz’s force equation is used to determine the

ICEPIC uses a ﬁxed, Cartesian, logical grid to diﬀer-
ence the electric and magnetic ﬁeld equations. The vector
quantities E, B, and J are staggered in their grid location
using the technique of Yee (1966). E and J are located
on the edges of the primary grid, whereas B is located on
the faces of the primary grid. An explicit leap-frog time
step technique is used to advance the electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds forward in time. The advantages of the leap-
frog method are simplicity and second-order accuracy. The
electric ﬁeld advances on whole integer time steps whereas
the magnetic ﬁeld and the current density advance on half
integer time steps.

The three components of the momentum and position
of each particle are updated via Eq. (1) using the Boris
relativistic particle push algorithm (Boris 1970). The par-
ticle equations for velocity and position are also advanced
with a leap-frog technique. The velocity components are
advanced on half integer time steps, and the particle posi-
tions are updated on integer time steps. The current den-
sity weighting employs an exact charge conserving current
weighting algorithm by Villasenor & Buneman (1992), en-
E = ρ/ǫ0. Once the particles’ positions and
forcing
velocities are updated and the new current density is up-
dated on the grid, the solution process starts over again
by solving the ﬁeld equations.

2.2. The Dielectric Fluid Model

For very dense plasmas, it is often a very good approx-
imation to treat the plasma as a dielectric ﬂuid. In the
presence of EM radiation, this approximation is good for
time-scales over which the ﬂuid moves a negligible amount.
The dielectric constant used in the ﬂuid approximation is

frequency νs, and the frequency of the electromagnetic ra-
diation ωEM)

2.3. Numerical Methods to Create Hybrid Models

Developing a consistent way to divide the simulated
plasma into ﬂuid and particle portions is one of the more
complicated aspects of this approach. Several details need
to be considered. Most importantly, the distinction be-
tween the ﬂuid and particle descriptions is not a physical
one, but rather a computational necessity. As such, it is
crucial that dividing the plasma into two separate popula-
tions does not introduce any spurious observable behaviors
in the physics. The real-world plasma is not divided, so
the particles and the ﬂuid must be compelled to interact
as a single species. This manifests itself in two ways; ﬁrst,
the mechanism for exchanging particles into ﬂuid (and vice
versa) must be seamless enough that it does not aﬀect the
global properties of the plasma. Second, the ﬂuctuations
in density, pressure, and temperature in the ﬂuid must af-
fect the dynamics of the PIC particles in exactly the same
way as if those ﬂuctuations had occurred in a purely PIC
model.
In the special case where the density contained
in the ﬂuid is signiﬁcantly greater than the density in the
particles, it may be a good approximation to neglect these
ﬂuctuations in the PIC particles. This is discussed later
in section 2.5.

Another important priority in the development of a use-
ful hybrid model is to determine the optimal way to divide
the plasma. An appropriate criterion must be found for

the exchange of PIC particles with ﬂuid density. It is im-
portant to treat as much of the plasma as possible with
the ﬂuid model, since this minimizes computation time.
On the other hand, if the decision criterion is computa-
tionally expensive, it would not be sensible to perform the
particle-ﬂuid exchange in every time step. A balance must
be found between the time saved by moving particles into
the ﬂuid and the time spent deciding whether the parti-
cles can be moved without sabotaging the accuracy of the
simulation.

Finally, although collision physics have been added to
the ﬂuid and PIC models independently, collisions between
particles and elements of ﬂuid have not yet been modeled
and tested for the current simulations, and are a subject
for future study. Ultimately, these will aﬀect the balance
of the energy and the density in the ﬂuid. More extensive
future modeling will include the eﬀects of mobility, dif-
fusion, ionization with the background gas, and feedback
heating from the external ﬁelds.

2.4. Discussion of Hybrid Errors and Limitations

Quantitatively, implementing a hybrid approach is ac-
complished by dividing the distribution of the plasma f
into two separate populations, f1 and f2. The distribu-
tions f1 and f2 sum to the total distribution f = f1 + f2
and for simplicity are positive deﬁnite such that f1 < f
and f2 < f . From a ﬂuid perspective, the continuity equa-
tion and ﬂuid force equations are obtained by taking the
ﬁrst two moments of the Vlasov equation, which dictates
the evolution of the plasma distribution function in a 6+1
dimensional (x,v,t) phase space.

Here the eﬀects of collisions are ignored. Since each term
in the Vlasov equation is linear in f , the continuity and
force equations contain no terms proportional to f1f2, and
can be satisﬁed by evolving the two populations separately.
For the test problem presented in the following section, one
of the two populations is evolved using the PIC technique,
while the other population is treated as a dielectric ﬂuid.
The PIC technique automatically satisﬁes the continuity
and force equations, but our implementation of the dielec-
tric ﬂuid does not contain two of the terms in the force

term. The justiﬁcation for neglecting these terms is that
drift velocities in the ﬂuid will be small, and components
of the plasma with high energies and velocities will be
modeled with PIC particles.

×

When collisions are added the description becomes more
complex because collisions will have to be modeled be-
tween populations, as well as within each population. In
this case linearity is lost, and it may not be possible to de-
couple the evolution of the two populations. It may, how-
ever, be acceptable to make certain simplifying assump-
tions, such as nparticles << nﬂuid. In this limit, the con-
tribution to the ﬂuid dynamics from ﬂuid-ﬂuid collisions
far exceed the contribution from ﬂuid-particle collisions,
and the latter might safely be neglected. The error in-
troduced by this assumption will depend on the relative
distributions f1 and f2. When implementing the model of
collisions it is necessary to estimate analytically the error
introduced as a function of the particle density nparticles,
and re-distribute the populations when a pre-determined
threshold for error is reached. The error analysis of this
method to incorporate collisions into the hybrid plasma
model is currently under investigation.

2.5. The Dispersion Relation

To demonstrate that the numerical methods discussed
above are valid treatments of high density plasma physics
in large volumes, we have employed these methods to
calculate the dispersion relation of electromagnetic plane
waves traveling through a plasma in a two dimensional
box. This is simple enough that an analytic expression
for the dispersion relation exists, and also small enough
to make an explicit PIC treatment practical, even for very
high densities. In this way we are able to directly compare
the theoretical prediction of the dispersion relation to the
results of the individual particle (PIC) and dielectric ﬂuid
treatments, and to the PIC-ﬂuid hybrid computation. We
perform all the calculations (analytic and numerical) in the
limit of non-relativistic thermal velocities in the plasma, a
good approximation in clouds of plasma recently ionized
by directed energy sources.

The analytic expression relating the frequency ωEM of
transverse electromagnetic waves to the wave number k in

4

Hybrid Plasma Modeling

a cold plasma is given by the following dispersion relation
(see e.g. Chen 1984):

ω2

EM = ω2

p + k2c2

.

(8)

Here the plasma frequency ωp depends on the density and
and species of the plasma and is given in section 2.2. and
the collision frequency νs is assumed to be zero. The ex-
pression for the dispersion relation becomes signiﬁcantly
more complicated for a warm plasma, because thermal ve-
locities allow for a coupling between adjacent regions in the
equations of motion, due to local pressure gradients. How-
ever, in the non-relativistic limits being considered here,
the change in the dispersion relation due to thermal ﬂuc-
tuations is less than 0.01%, and we neglect the eﬀect.

×

×

We have performed simulations in a simple geometry
in order to extract the numerical dispersion relation and
compare the results to the theoretically expected curve.
A row of dipole antennas polarized in the ˆz direction are
lined up at the left end of a long box ﬁlled with a relatively
1017electrons/m3 corresponding
dense cold plasma (1.43
109 rad/sec). The
to a plasma frequency of ωp = 21.1
antennas are driven in phase with an oscillating current,
at a peak amplitude of 0.1 Amps, to generate a plane wave
in the plasma. The top and bottom edges of the box are
deﬁned by metal boundaries. There is a perfectly matched
layer (PML) on both the left and right sides of the box to
prevent any reﬂection of incoming EM waves, simulating
an inﬁnite domain in that direction. A cartoon of the ge-
ometry is shown in Figure (1). Simulations run from one to
four light crossing times. At one light crossing time there
are observable transient eﬀects while the current in the
antennas ramps up, while at 4 light crossing times there is
signiﬁcant beating from reﬂections oﬀ of the interior of the
plasma. While these eﬀects make it diﬃcult to quantify
properties of the plasma such as the skin depth or trans-
mission and reﬂection coeﬃcients, neither of them aﬀected
the calculated values of k associated with the frequency of
the incoming plane wave.

PML on left and right, and a cold plasma in the interior.
The line of dipole antennas (polarized in ˆz) generating the
EM plane wave is marked with dots on the left side. The
dimensions of the box are 1.4m

0.5m

×

To bench-mark the performance of the PIC-ﬂuid hybrid
treatment, we ﬁrst run simulations in this geometry with
the plasma consisting of only PIC particles, then with only
dielectric ﬂuid. We then test a model where half of the
plasma is treated as PIC particles and the other half mod-
eled as a ﬂuid. This division is in each cell, rather than

in diﬀerent spatial regions in the box. There is no mech-
anism for exchange between ﬂuid and particles. The sim-
ulations are run using many frequencies of the EM plane
waves, thus providing several diﬀerent data points to ﬁt
to the theoretical dispersion curve. To calculate the value
of k, the pixels are averaged in the ˆy direction, and a spa-
tial Fourier transform taken of the resulting 1-D (ˆx) array.
The error in the resulting wave number k is inherited from
the ﬁnite box size.

3. RESULTS

The dispersion relations obtained from the explicit PIC,
dielectric ﬂuid, and ﬂuid-PIC hybrid models are displayed
in Figure (2) along with the theoretical value from Eq.
(7). Although the value of k is the dependent variable
in our analysis, we plot the wavenumber on the x axis so
the dispersion relation takes its familiar form. All three
modeling techniques yield the same values of k within the
resolution of the simulations; they agree to within
2.5
cycles/m, approximately the width of the symbols used in
the plot.

The transmission of electromagnetic radiation through
a plasma as a function of the plasma density and chemical
properties is another interesting quantity to consider when
evaluating the validity of the particle-ﬂuid hybrid model.
We are particularly interested in probing the regime where
the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation is compa-
rable to the plasma frequency. To calculate the transmis-
sion coeﬃcient as a function of the frequency of the plane
wave, we modiﬁed the geometry of the previous simulation
to include three regions; a vacuum region containing the
antennas, a region in the center containing a cold plasma

obtained from the boundary matching at the two vacuum-

ima in the transmission coeﬃcient depend upon the width
of the plasma region, in this simulation 7cm.

Although there is striking agreement between the com-
puted values of the transmission coeﬃcients and dispersion
relation with the theoretically predicted curves, a formal
demonstration of the convergence of the code is needed
to be sure that the resolution is suﬃcient to accurately
model the physics. We have examined the transmission
at three diﬀerent wavelengths of incident radiation, corre-
sponding to a local maximum (λ = 7.0 cm), a local min-
imum (λ = 7.73 cm), and an area of high slope nearer
to the plasma frequency(λ = 8.25 cm). For each of these
cases, the spatial resolution of the grid was varied from 6
to 40 cells per free-space wavelength of the incident radi-
ation. When there were particles in the simulations, the
total number of particles was kept ﬁxed. At the ﬁnest
spatial resolution there were enough particles per cell to
maintain numerical accuracy. The results of this investi-
gation are summarized in Figure (4), which demonstrates
2nd order convergence to the theoretical value. From Fig-
ure (4) we conclude that at a resolution of 20 cells per
wavelength, the resolution used when generating Figures
(2)and (3), the code has converged to produce less than
6% worst-case error from the theoretical value. Seven of
nine runs at this resolution produced errors less than 1%.
Simulations yielding errors larger than 1% correspond to a
wavelength of 8.25 cm, which is in a high slope region of the
theoretical curve. Here, the small errors in plasma width
as represented by the grid lead to larger errors in the sim-
ulated transmission. The reader should be reminded that

4. CONCLUSIONS

We demonstrate the validity of a powerful new tech-
nique that allows numerical simulations of high density
plasmas in large volumes to be computationally tractable
in reasonable times. Among other applications such as
tokamaks, plasma processing, atmospheric plasmas (light-
ning, red sprites, blue jets), plasma-display plasmas, and
lighting, this approach will aid in the exploration of many
unanswered questions about Radio Frequency (RF) break-
down in air. We are particularly interested in understand-

6

Hybrid Plasma Modeling

ing the mechanisms of breakdown. High density plasmas
in large volumes occur relatively frequently when study-
ing High Power Microwave (HPM) or other directed energy
devices. Sources of high power microwaves can cause RF
breakdown in air or other gaseous media in the vicinity of
the antenna. It is extremely useful for design exploration if
such breakdown processes could be modeled computation-
ally. Several details can be added to make this tool even
more useful. Collisional interactions can be implemented
in both the PIC and ﬂuid treatments, taking care that
collisional interactions between the populations are accu-
rately modeled. The treatment should also be adapted to
accommodate relativistic particle velocities. Reasonable
mechanisms need to be added for interchange of parti-
cles to ﬂuid, and vice versa. These mechanisms must be
treated with care so as not to introduce any spurious ef-
fects into the physics.

When collisions and gas chemistry have been fully imple-
mented we will use this method to explore the details of the
plasma formation as a function of the pulse width, the E
ﬁeld intensities causing the breakdown, and the properties
of the background gas (density, impurities). We hope to
quantitatively determine when the breakdown occurs and
what fraction of the RF pulse is reﬂected, an eﬀect that
causes tail erosion. By determining the ionization states
that are produced, and the densities that are reached, we
will be able to describe how the global properties of the
medium will change.

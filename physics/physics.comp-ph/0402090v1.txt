Abstract

A Monte Carlo Renormalization Group algorithm is used on the Ising
model to derive critical exponents and the critical temperature. The algo-
rithm is based on a minimum relative entropy iteration developed previ-
ously to derive potentials from equilibrium conﬁgurations. This previous
algorithm is modiﬁed to derive useful information in an RG iteration. The
method is applied in several dimensions with limited success. Required
accuracy has not been achieved, but the method is interesting.

Introduction

Monte Carlo Renormalization Group has been used with much success for over
twenty-ﬁve years. The Large Cell Renormalization method calculates the renor-
malized parameters by renormalizing the system to a two spin system which
can be solved exactly. Swendsen’s method avoids calculating the renormailized
parameters by using a Taylor expansion of the Renormalization operator. Cal-
culating several variances leads to a determination of the eigenvalues of the
operator [8, 6, 4]. Ma’s method calculates the parameters in the Renormal-
In
ized Hamiltonian using an analysis of the Monte Carlo dynamics [4, 5].
our method, the parameters of the Renormalized Hamiltonian are derived us-
ing a minimum relative entropy iteration. The number of coupling parameters
is controlled and error in the method can be estimated using usual statisti-
cal methods. The eigenvalues of the operator can be determined directly from
the Renormalized Hamiltonian. This also allows the critical temperature to be
directly calculated. Higher order coupling parameters can be included for an
estimate of their eﬀect.

Our Method

The following is based largely on an algorithm originally developed by reference
[2]. The method is based on the following assumptions. The system is assumed
to be in thermodynamic equilibrium and the energy can be written as a sum
of terms which are products of parameters and functions of the conﬁguration.
E(Γ, ~P ) = Pi pi ∗ hi(Γ) = ~P · ~H where Γ represents the conﬁguration of the
system(s). ~P = {pi} represents the set of parameters to be derived.
In the
case of the Ising Model, E = −J P<ij> si · sj − K Pi si.
In our notation,
h1 = P<ij> si · sj , p1 = −J , h2 = Pi si and p2 = −K.

The probability of a conﬁguration, given parameters, is given by the Boltz-
mann distribution P rob(Γ| ~P ) = e−E(Γ, ~P )/kT /Z = e(−E(Γ, ~P )+F ( ~P ))/kT ,where
Z( ~P ) = PΓ Exp(−βE(Γ, ~P )) and F ( ~P ) = −kT ln(Z( ~P )).

If we are given the exact equilibrium conformation, Γ∗ , the maximum likeli-
hood of parameter values are those values for which the probability, P rob(Γ∗| ~P )
is a maximum wrt ~P . Maximizing an exponential corresponds to maximizing the
argument (ignoring the multiplicative constant β), −E(Γ∗, ~P ) + F ( ~P ) = Q( ~P ).
This also corresponds to extremizing the entropy T S = E − F .

Our method is basically the multi-dimensional form of Newton’s method for

optimizing functions. Maximizing Q( ~P ), Newton’s Method is

~P k+1 = ~P k − D2(Q( ~P k))

−1 · D(Q( ~P k))

where (D2)−1 represents the inverse Hessian matrix and D represents the gra-
dient. In practice this is modiﬁed slightly,

~P k+1 = ~P k + ǫ(∆ ~P )

where the use of ǫ < 1 corresponds to the ”Damped Newton’s Method”.

Maximizing Q = −E + F wrt ~P using statistical mechanical deﬁnitions leads

to the following

D(Q)i = −h

∗
i + < hi >

D2(Q)i,j = β(< hi >< hj > − < hihj >) = −βCov(hi, hj)
(4)
Resulting in the following iterative equation where V CM ( ~H) is the variance-
covariance matrix of ~H

∆ ~P = kT ∗ V CM ( ~H)

−1 · (< ~H > − ~H ∗)

The method is easily generalized to a distribution of equilibrium conﬁgurations.

∆ ~P = kT ∗ V CM ( ~H)

−1 • (< ~H > − < ~H >P rob(Γ))

< ... > represents a Boltzmann average and < ... >P rob(Γ) represents an average
over the given distribution.

Renormalization

Renormalization can be described as an operator acting on the original Hamil-
tonian to create a Renormalized Hamiltonian. Linearizing the operator near
the ﬁxed point, relevent eigenvalues can be isolated. By examining the plot of
renormalized vs original parameters, the eigenvalues can be determined. The
eigenvalues λi, correspond to the slope of these lines. With the usual approx-
imations, the exponents can be calculated , νi = ln(b)/ ln(λi) [4]. The critical
temperature can be determined by calculating the intersection of the derived
thermal coupling parameters and the line y=x. Flow diagams could easily be
extracted, although they are not done in this study.

Using Renormalization notation, the reduced hamiltonian for the Ising model

is given below.

Hr = −H/kT

Hr = K0Σsi + K1Σnnsisj + K2Σnnnsisj + K4Σsquaresisjsksl + ...

Applying the algorithm to Renormalization requires an outer iteration over a
parameter (ie Ki for some i) while other parameters remain ﬁxed.

The original system(s) is brought to equilibrium at some ﬁxed values for all
parameters. The renormalized system(s) is created from this original system.
The above iteration represented by equations 1,2 and 5 can be carried out on
large number of lattices simultaneously to determine what values of parameters
would lead to this renormalized system. As a parameter is varied the corre-
sponding eigenvalues and critical exponents can be derived. The method is
simpler to apply if the renormalization method is not a quasi-linear method [3].
Majority rule renormalization is used in all of the following.

2-D Ising Model

The algorithm was attempted on a 2-D Ising model. Exponents and critical
temperature are known from the original solution by Onsager [7, 1].

ν = 1 , θ = 8/15 and Tcritical = 2.269

2D Ising Model Thermal Coupling Exponent

The thermal eigenvalue can be determined by varying the ratio of J/kT through
the critical value at zero ﬁeld. The corresponding exponent, in terms of corre-
lation length and reduced temperature, is

ξ ∝ |t|

−ν

The renormalized parameters were calculated as per the above algorithm. Figure
1 shows several runs of various lattice sizes and number. The slopes, exponents
and critical temperatures are shown in table 1.

Magnetic eigenvalue

The other exponent and eigenvalue can be determined by ﬁxing J/kT at ap-
proximately the critical value and varying the ﬁeld parameter through zero.
The corresponding exponent, in terms of correlation length and ﬁeld, is

ξ ∝ |K|

K represents the external ﬁeld. The renormalized parameters were calculated as
per the above algorithm. Figure 2 shows data runs over a large variation in ﬁeld
parameter. The critical region, near zero ﬁeld, shows a more linear relationship
as shown in ﬁgure 3. Least squares best ﬁt to a straight line was done on this
central region. The results are shown in table 2.

Conclusion

Much higher precision and accuracy is required to compare with current esti-
mates of exponents, but the derived exponents match reasonably well with ex-
pected values. Improvement is expected with larger lattices and more systems,
perhaps with more clever averaging methods. The eﬀect of critical slowing down
has not been thouroughly investigated. The algorithm has several advantages
over other algorithms. The number of coupling parameters is kept the same from
original system to the renormalized system with minimum relative entropy de-
rived values for the renormalized parameters. This seems more consistent than
an arbitrary cutoﬀ in parameter space. The renormalized parameters are di-
rectly calculated, unlike other algorithms. By changing the parameter of the
outer iteration, all exponents can be magniﬁed and derived. If ﬂow diagrams
are desired, the algorithm could be easily modiﬁed to provide them. The error
in the calculated exponents can be derived through usual statistical properties.

Abstract

The dynamic evolution at zero temperature of a uniform Ising fer-
romagnet on a square lattice is followed by Monte Carlo computer
simulations. The system always eventually reaches a ﬁnal, absorbing
state, which sometimes coincides with a ground state (all spins paral-
lel), and sometimes does not (parallel stripes of spins up and down).
We initiate here the numerical study of “Chaotic Time Dependence”
(CTD) by seeing how much information about the ﬁnal state is pre-
dictable from the randomly generated quenched initial state. CTD
was originally proposed to explain how nonequilibrium spin glasses
could manifest equilibrium pure state structure, but in simpler sys-
tems such as homogeneous ferromagnets it is closely related to long-
term predictability and our results suggest that CTD might indeed
occur in the inﬁnite volume limit.

1 Introduction

We consider the Ising model on an L×L square lattice with periodic boundary
conditions. Each site carries a spin either up or down, i.e. Sij = ±1, i, j = 1,
2 . . . L. A pair of neighboring sites has unit energy if the two spin orientations
are antiparallel; parallel spins have no energy. The total energy thus ranges
from E = 0 to 2L2, with the lowest possible energy E = 0 corresponding to
either of the two ground states with all spins either up or down.

A randomly chosen state of this system is stored into the computer mem-
ory, and the following dynamic rule is applied to it. A site is chosen at
random, and its spin is a candidate to be ﬂipped. If the energy decreases as
a result of this ﬂip, then we perform it. Energy increases are not accepted:
the chosen spin keeps its current state. If the energy would be unchanged,
then the ﬂip is performed with probability 1/2. This procedure is then re-
peated for another randomly chosen site, and so on.

Physically, this problem corresponds to a sudden quenching from inﬁnite
to zero temperature. It was previously studied by measuring the ordinary
magnetization, for instance in references [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Here we consider
it from a completely diﬀerent point of view: our interest is to study the
inﬂuence of the starting state on a conﬁguration at a later time t.

For each starting state, we perform D independent runs, each correspond-
ing to a diﬀerent realization of the dynamics (i.e., a diﬀerent, and also ran-
domly chosen, chronological order of spins selected to be ﬂipped along with
a diﬀerent coin toss for each zero-energy ﬂip encountered). Each step in the
time t corresponds to L2 ﬂip attempts, i.e. a whole-lattice sweep, on average.
The local quantity

is calculated at each site ij , for t = 0, 1, 2 . . .. Furthermore, for each t, the
global averages

Figure 1: Time functions Q(t) and R(t), Eqs. (2) and (3), averaged over
100 diﬀerent initial states. Each curve corresponds to a diﬀerent starting
magnetization m: exactly 0 (bottom curves in both sides), 0.01, 0.02, 0.03,
0.04, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30 (from bottom to top). At the beginning,
Q(t = 0) = m and R(t = 0) = 1 in all cases. The error bars lie mostly within
the symbols, except for some cases. Note that only for the symmetric case
m = 0 one gets Q(t) = 0 within the error bars (left). On the other hand,
R(t) does not vanish even for this same symmetric case (right). Other lattice
sizes, both smaller and larger than L = 14, follow the same behavior.

In some sense, our approach is the opposite of the process called “damage
spreading”, where two slightly diﬀerent initial states are followed exactly by
the same dynamic rule, including the same sequence of spins to be ﬂipped
and any other internal or external contingency. Here, we are interested in
the eﬀect on the ﬁnal state of diﬀerent contingencies occurring during the
time evolution, i.e., diﬀerent chronological orders of the spins to be ﬂipped
and diﬀerent coin tosses for deciding zero-energy ﬂips. Starting from the
same initial conﬁguration, equations (1), (2) and (3) compare D parallel,

3

independent evolutions of the same initial state.

Figure 1 shows the time dependences of the global averages for S = 100
samples, and D = 3000 diﬀerent dynamics each. Each sample corresponds to
a new starting conﬁguration which is randomly chosen within a ﬁxed value
for the magnetization at t = 0:

m =

Sij

for t = 0 .

In order to prepare the starting state, we choose exactly (1 + m)L2/2
sites with spins up, the remainder (1 − m)L2/2 sites with spins down. Our
program stores one spin per bit along a 32-bit computer word, corresponding
to 32 diﬀerent starting states processed at once. For that, we proﬁt from
the fast bitwise operations, using techniques described in [6]. As a check,
we performed also the same simulations starting from completely random
conﬁgurations, instead of classifying them according to the magnetization.
The results (not shown) are similar to those obtained from m = 0, but with
much larger ﬂuctuations.

One important feature exhibited in Figure 1 is that any small non-zero
starting magnetization is enough to break the symmetry: for large enough
times, the system saturates on a non-vanishing value for Q(t), always larger
than the starting magnetization itself. This is true even for larger lattices
(not shown), for which one can better approach the limit m → 0.

As we discuss more fully in the next section when we introduce the notion
of “Chaotic Time Dependence” [7], a basic issue we wish to explore concerns
the whole set of D distinct dynamical histories starting from the same initial
In principle, this could be studied by considering Q(t), as t → ∞,
state.
without any averaging over S samples (since such averaging would give a
quantity essentially the same as the average magnetization) by seeing whether
Q(∞) was nonzero for a nonnegligible fraction of starting states. If somehow
all these D distinct histories diverge from each other, how much do they
keep in common due to their common starting point? This is the question
we are interested in. For initial magnetizations m 6= 0, the left part of
Figure 1 provides a clear answer. For m = 0, instead, we look at the quantity
R(t → ∞) which we can average over S samples and ask whether it stays
nonzero as system size increases.

Based on the observation that any non-zero starting magnetization is
enough to break the up/down symmetry, we conclude that the most inter-

4

esting case is the initially symmetric situation, i.e. m = 0 exactly. Thus,
hereafter we will treat only this case, ﬁxing attention on the behavior of R(t).
The text is divided into two more sections: ﬁrst the description of our

simulations and the presentation of the results, then our conclusions.

2 Description and Results

A ﬁrst important observation concerns the absorbing state, i.e.
the ﬁnal
distribution of all spins from which no more changes are possible. Before the
system reaches this situation, we call it alive, after, it is dead. These terms
apply to the whole lattice, not to each spin: the system is dead when no
energy decrease or tie can be achieved by ﬂipping any of its spins. As noted
earlier, there are only two possible ground states each with energy E = 0,
with all spins either up or down. Both states are clearly absorbing. Our
simultations found that in roughly 2/3 of the realizations the system becomes
eventually dead in one of these two ground states: we label these realizations
with the symbol GS. However, within the remainder 1/3 of the realizations,
the system becomes trapped into other absorbing states with E > 0. The
common example is a striped conﬁguration, with alternating stripes of up and
down spins, whose widths are larger than one layer. Clearly, this situation
does not allow any further change, and the system becomes dead as soon as it
is reached: we label these cases with the symbol ST. All of these ﬁndings are
in agreement with earlier studies [3, 5]. Figure 2 shows two typical countings
of GS versus ST situations. Note that the approximate balance 2/3 against
1/3 does not depend on the lattice size: striped conﬁgurations always appear,
independently of the lattice size.

We discard ST situations, keeping only GS in our statistics. Striped con-
ﬁgurations appear as a consequence of the ﬁnite lattice size. In an inﬁnite
lattice, domains of up or down neighboring spins grow forever; there is zero
probability (with respect to either initial conﬁguration or dynamical real-
ization) of the system evolving towards a ‘striped’, or domain wall, state as
t → ∞ [9]. This means that any ﬁnite region eventually consists of only
a single domain (equivalently, after some ﬁxed ﬁnite time its spin conﬁgu-
ration is GS). Therefore, if our simulations are to provide insights into the
inﬁnite lattice situation, it is proper to consider only GS realizations. All
other possibilities are consequences of ﬁnite size and are thus discarded.

There is also a ‘practical’ reason for discarding runs terminating in a

striped conﬁguration: they are boundary-condition-dependent. Of course,
when starting a run, one is not able to predict whether it will evolve into a GS
or ST conﬁguration, since the outcome can a priori depend on the dynamical
realization. We therefore run each dynamical realization twice. First, we note
simply whether for that particular dynamics the system reaches a GS or a ST
conﬁguration. By doing this we can perform separate statistics for GS and
ST outcomes. As an example, we analyze a quantity deﬁned by Derrida [10]:
the fraction of ‘never ﬂipped’ spins as a function of time. This quantity is
called persistence, and was shown to display critical behavior, i.e.,

p ∝ t−θ

,

(5)

decaying as a power-law whose critical exponent θ obeys some universality
properties [10]. It is shown in Figure 3. Indeed, the plot obtained from only
GS realizations saturates later than the corresponding ST plot, for the same

as p ∝ t−θ. Curves with averages over only GS or only ST realizations are
shown. The critical exponent we obtained from GS statistics is θ ≈ 0.24
(the same also for other values of L and D), in good agreement with earlier
studies [10]. Also, the ﬁnal saturated fraction f scales with the lattice size

practical advantage.

As a byproduct, we also ﬁnd the further ﬁnite-size-scaling relation

for the asymptotic saturated persistence f , which does not depend on the
number D of dynamics.

Figure 4 shows another example, now for the quantity R (cf. Eq. (3)).
It saturates in a much smaller value for GS than for ST. This is true also
for other lattice sizes, both smaller and larger than L = 22. Note also the
smaller ﬂuctuations (error bars) obtained for GS. Figure 5 shows the same
behavior, for a larger lattice, now in logarithmic scale.

Figure 4: Quantity R as a function of time, averaged over GS (bottom) and

Contrary to persistence, the asymptotic value R(t → ∞) does depend
on the number D of dynamics. Figure 6 illustrates the distinct behaviors of
R(t → ∞), for GS and ST realizations, as the number D of dynamical runs
increases. For GS the function R(t) is considerably smaller for large enough
times.

Let us denote by RGS
L

the D → ∞, t → ∞ value of R(t), restricted to
GS realizations (but otherwise averaged over all initial states). This quantity
provides a measure of the information about the ﬁnal state already contained
in a typical, randomly chosen, initial state.
It cannot vanish for a ﬁxed
ﬁnite size L because there are some GS realizations that deﬁnitely determine
the ﬁnal state, independent of dynamical realization. Figure 6 does not
show signiﬁcant size dependence of R(t) at large t, and hence suggests the
possibility that RGS
L may not tend to zero as L → ∞. This in turn suggests
that the phenomenon of “Chaotic Time Dependence” (CTD) [7] might be
occurring.

CTD concerns the large-time predictability of an inﬁnite system based
on the randomly generated initial state and not dependent on the realization

of the dynamics. CTD means that < S11 > at time t, averaged over all the
dynamics, in the limit L → ∞, does not tend to zero as t → ∞ (and thus
forever oscillates between positive and negative values) for typical randomly
generated initial states. We note that in principle, CTD could occur even
without the nonvanishing of RGS
L→∞ since CTD does not involve any restriction
of initial states (to GS) or any averaging over initial states (or equivalently
over sites in the lattice). On the other hand, it seems clear that CTD should
occur if indeed RGS

L→∞ 6= 0.

Figure 7 shows the number of still alive realizations as a function of time,
again within separated statistics for GS and ST. One observes that some GS
realizations are already dead when the ﬁrst death among ST occurs. Then,
within a narrow time interval, all ST die. On the other hand, after a sudden
but not extinguishing drop around to ≈ 1000, GS realizations die within a
slower rate: some of them survive much more time. The inset shows this last
regime for GS, with linear horizontal scale, indicating an exponential decay.
The characteristic time when the sudden drop occurs (to ≈ 1000 in Figure 7)
depends on the lattice size L, but not on the number D of dynamics: the

larger the lattice size, the later the system enters into the ﬁnal exponential
decay for GS realizations (inset of Figure 7). This regime corresponds to a
big sea of up spins with some shrinking islands of neighboring down spins, or
vice-versa. It begins at to, when the spontaneous symmetry breaking ﬁnally
occurs and one of the two possible spin orientations up or down has a majority
for the ﬁrst time: from to on, this majority fraction increases exponentially
fast. An interesting observation is the coincidence of the beginning of this
regime with the sudden death of all ST realizations, reinforcing once more
our interpretation of ST as mere ﬁnite size artifacts: the further exponential
decay is aborted for ST realizations, because the minority islands (narrowest
stripes) are artiﬁcially made stable by the boundary conditions.

with α ≈ 2, ﬁgure 8. A simple reasoning shows the compatibility of this
behavior with that corresponding to persistence, as in Figure 3. At t = 1
(one complete lattice sweep) the average fraction of non-ﬂipped spins is a
constant (numerically 0.708; note also the abrupt drop from R(0) = 1 to
R(1) ≈ 0.25 in Figure 1), while at the characteristic time to the ﬁnal value f is
reached (Figure 3). Thus, from equation (5) we can express the corresponding
exponent as

θ =

ln(const) − ln(f )
ln(to) − ln(1)

or

to ∝ f −1/θ

.

Finally, from equation (6) we get

By comparing equation (7) with (9), we get the scaling relation

in agreement with our numerical values θ = 0.238 ± 0.002, β = 0.466 ± 0.002
and α = 1.96 ± 0.06.

An interesting interpretation for the exponent α = 2 follows. One partic-
ular cluster of neighboring parallel spins grows like a diﬀusive random walk,
thus with diameter proportional to t1/2. This cluster eventually covers the
entire lattice, i.e. L ∝ t1/2
. Indeed, by following the growth process of the
largest cluster just before covering the entire lattice, one observes a typical
diﬀusive process.

3 Conclusions

We have studied the dynamical evolution of 2D Ising ferromagnets to ex-
plore the extent to which information contained in the randomly generated
initial state determines large-time behavior. We did this by comparing dif-
ferent realizations of the dynamical evolution, all starting from the same

12

initial state, i.e., by monitoring the correlations between possible alternative
diﬀerent histories, as functions of time.

Among other ﬁndings, we detected two diﬀerent regimes during the time
evolution towards the ground state, by counting how many realizations have
already reached it as time goes by. We dicovered the size dependence of the
characteristic relaxation time, to ∝ Lβ/θ, where θ is the Derrida exponent
and β measures the size scaling of the saturated persistence f (cf. Eq. (6)
and Figure 3).

Our most intriguing ﬁnding is the suggestion from Figure 6 that the
predictability measure RGS
L may not vanish in the limit L → ∞ so that even
in the inﬁnite volume limit there may be predictability of information about
the arbitrarily large time behavior of the system contained in a randomly
generated initial state. This will be pursued in a future paper.

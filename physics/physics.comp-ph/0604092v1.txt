We use Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation to study a magnetic tip-sample interac-
tion. Our interest is to understand the mechanism of heat dissipation when the forces involved in the
system are magnetic in essence. We consider a magnetic crystalline substrate composed of several
layers interacting magnetically with a tip. The set is put thermally in equilibrium at temperature
T by using a numerical Monte Carlo technique. By using that conﬁguration we study its dynamical
evolution by integrating numerically the equations of motion. Our results suggests that the heat
dissipation in this system is closed related to the appearing of vortices in the sample.

INTRODUCTION

The friction between two sliding surfaces is one of the
oldest phenomena studied in natural sciences [1].
In a
macroscopic scale it is known that the force of friction
between surfaces satisﬁes some rules: 1 - The friction is
independent of the contacting area between surfaces. 2 -
It is proportional to the normal force applied and 3 - The
force of kinetic friction is independent of relative speed
between surfaces. That behavior being the result of many
microscopic interactions between atoms and molecules of
both surfaces, it is also dependent on the roughness, tem-
perature and energy dissipation mechanisms. Therefore,
to understand friction it is necessary to understand its
microscopic mechanisms[2].

For several applications of now a days technology the
understanding of how heat is dissipated when mobile
parts are involved, plays an important role. The avail-
ability of reﬁned experimental techniques makes it now
possible to investigate the fundamental processes that
contribute to the sliding friction on an atomic scale. Is-
sues like how energy dissipates on the substrate, which
is the main dissipation channel (electronic or phononic)
and how the phononic sliding friction coeﬃcient depends
on the corrugation amplitude were addressed , and par-
tially solved, by some groups. [3, 4]. Less known is the
eﬀect on friction of a magnetic tip moving relative to a
magnetic surface. Applications of sub-micron magnets
in spintronics, quantum computing, and data storage de-
mand a huge understanding of the sub-micron behavior

of magnetic materials. The construction of magnetic de-
vices has to deal with distances of nanometers between
the reading head and the storage device. That makes
the study of tribological phenomena crucial to under-
stand and produce technologically competitive devices
[8, 9, 10]. In particular the dissipation of heat in mag-
netic dispositives is a very serious problem. For example,
in a magnetic hard disk for data storage the reading head
passing close to the surface of the disk transfers momen-
tum to it. That momentum transference rises locally
the temperature. Depending on the rate transfer and
the capability of the disk to transfer that energy to the
neighborhood some, or all, the information stored in the
disk can be lost. In the last decade, the progress in the
magnetic recording media and the reading head technol-
ogy has made the recording density doubled almost every
two years. The magnetic bit size used in the most ad-
vanced hard-disk-drives is as small as 0.5 × 0.05m2, while
a giant magneto-resistance head is used to read the bit.
This magnetic bit size can still be diminished by using
materials with high magnetic anisotropy. However, the
paramagnetic limit, when the anisotropy energy becomes
comparable to the thermal ﬂuctuations, is not far to be
attained. That is a physical limitation to the technology
for the production of magnetic recording media. In that
case, the comprehension of the microscopic mechanism
of heat dissipation is crucial. Since friction is an out-
of-equilibrium phenomenon its study presents numerous
theoretical and experimental challenges.

In magnetic ﬁlms for which the exchange interaction
is less than the separation between layers form quasi 2
dimensional (2d) magnetic planar structures. In general
the magnetization of such ﬁlms is conﬁned to the plane
due to shape anisotropy. An exception to that is the
appearing of vortices in the system. A vortex being a
topological excitation in which the integral of line of the
ﬁeld on a closed path around the excitation core precess

by 2π (−2π) (See ﬁgure 1.). To the purpose of avoid-
ing the high energetic cost of non-aligned moments, the
vortices develop a three dimensional structure by turn-
ing out of the plane the magnetic moment components in
the vortex core.[11] For data storage purposes, magnetic
vortices are of high interest since its study provides fun-
damental insight in the mesoscopic magnetic structures
of the system[12].

In this paper we use a combined Monte Carlo-
Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD) simulation to study the
energy dissipation mechanism in a prototype model con-
sisting of a reading head moving close to a magnetic
disk surface. A schematic view is shown in ﬁgure 2.
Our model consists of a magnetic tip (The reading head)
which moves close to a magnetic surface (The disk sur-
face.). The tip is simulated as a cubic arrangement
of magnetic dipoles and the surface is represented as a
monolayer of magnetic dipoles distributed in a square
lattice. We suppose that the dipole interactions are
shielded, so that, we do not have to consider them as
long range interactions. This trick simpliﬁes enormously
the calculations putting the cpu time inside reasonable
borders. The dipole can be represented by classical spin
like variables ~S = Sx ˆx + Sy ˆy + Sz ˆz. The total energy of
this arrangement is a sum of exchange energy, anisotropy
energy and the kinetic energy due to the relative move-
ment between the tip and the surface as follows.

between the tip and the surface. The symbol < ij >
means that the sums are to be performed over the ﬁrst
neighbors. For the tip-surface interaction, we suppose
that the coupling, Jh−s, is ferromagnetic. By consider-
ing that Jh−s is a function of distance, will allow us to
study the eﬀects of the relative tip-surface movement.
The exchange anisotropic term λ, controls the kind of
vortex which is more stable in the lattice. There is a
critical value of the anisotropy, λc ≈ 0.7J [11], such that
for λ < λc the spins inside the vortex core minimizes
the vortex energy by laying in an in-plane conﬁguration.
For λ > λc the conﬁguration that minimizes the vortex
energy is for the spins close to the center of the vor-
tex to develop a large out-of-plane component. The site
anisotropy, D, controls the out-of-plane magnetization
of the model. It is well known that a quasi-two dimen-
sional system with interaction as in equation 2 undergoes
a BKT phase transition for Dh suﬃciently small (In gen-
eral D/J << λ.), at some critical temperature TBKT . If,
D/J = λ = 0, TBKT ≈ 0.7. For D/J >> λ the system
has a second order phase transition at Tc which depends
on D.

In the sections below we will discuss the importance of
vortex formation for the energy dissipation of a magnetic
material. In the section II we introduce general aspects of
the numerical method used, in the section III we discuss
our results and in section IV we present our conclusions.

II. SIMULATION BACKGROUND

In this section we describe the numerical approach we
have used to simulate the model. The simulation is done
by using a combined Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics
(MC-MD) procedure. The particles in our simulation
move according Newton’s law of motion which can be
obtained by using the hamiltonian 1. The spins evolve
according to the equation of motion [13]

λs = λh = 0.6J, 0.9J to get vortices with in-plane and
out-of-plane cores respectively. Before we start the time

evolution, we have to know how the vortex density, ϕv,
depends on the temperature. In ﬁgure 3 we show a plot
of ϕv as a function of the temperature for the simulated
models. The vortex density increases monotonically with
T . If there is any relation between vortices and energy
dissipation, it is natural to think that an increase in the
vortex density is related to an increase in temperature.

With the head far from the surface, we start the time
evolution of the system at t = 0 with v = 0. This part of
the simulation serves as a guide to the rest of the simula-
tion. Only thermal ﬂuctuations of the vortex density can
be seen. At t = 200 the tip is released with initial veloc-
ity v0. For t > 200, the reading head starts to interact
with the surface. Some kinetic energy is transferred from
the head to the surface and we expect the vortex density
to increase. We will see in the following that depending
on the initial conditions and the symmetry of the sys-
tem (See equation 1) several things can happen.
In
the ﬁgures 4 to 7 we show plots of the averaged vortex
density as a function of the time for the set of the simu-
lated parameters as discussed above. In each ﬁgure, the
graphics from left to right and top to bottom correspond
to T = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8.

For the system with out-of-plane symmetry (Figure 4)
we observe that for low temperature the vortex density
augments when the tip passes over the surface. Initially
the vortex density grows reaching quickly a constant av-
erage. For higher temperature the vortex density is al-
most insensitive to the tip indicating that the energy
transfer becomes more diﬃcult. At low temperature it is
easier to excite the vortex mode since they have low cre-
ation energy due to the out-of-plane spin component. At

FIG. 2: Schematic view of our simulation arrangement. The
tip is simulated as a 5×5 rigid lattice of particles each carrying
a spin ~S. The surface is simulated as an arrangement of size
20 × 20. The tip is allowed to slid over the surface with initial
velocity v = v0 ˆx. Periodic boundary conditions are used for
the in plane directions of the surface. The arrows represent
the spins directions.

As we are mainly interested in the magnetic eﬀects we
consider the particles as ﬁxed letting the tip slid over the
surface. This generates a set of 3N + 3 coupled equations
of motion which are solved by increasing forward in time
the physical state of the system in small time steps of size
δt = 10−3J −1. The resulting equations are solved by us-
ing Runge-Kutta’s method of integration[14, 15, 16]. The
surface is arranged as a rigid 20a×20a square lattice with
periodic boundary conditions in the xy direction, where
a is the lattice spacing. The head is simulated as a rigid
5a × 5a square lattice. With no loss of generality the
lattice spacing will be taken as a = 1 from now on. In
ﬁgure 2 we show a schematic view of the arrangement
used in our simulation. Initially we put the tip at a large
distance from the surface, so that, Jh−s = 0. By using
the MC approach we equilibrate the system at a given
temperature, T . By controlling the energy of the system
we consider that the system is in equilibrium after 105
MC steps. Once the thermal equilibrium is reached we
observe the evolution of the separated systems for a small
time interval, τ , for posterior comparison. After that an
initial velocity, v = v0 ˆx is given to the tip. We follow the
system’s evolution by storing all positions, velocities and
spin components at each time step for posterior analy-
sis. A quantity of paramount importance for us is the
vortex density, ϕv(t), at the surface layer. We calculate
the vortex density as a function of temperature and time
for several values of the parameters λs, λh and Ds, Dh.
As discussed in the following the vortex density will be
related to energy dissipation. The energy is measured in
units of Jh = Js = J, temperature in units of J/kB, time
in units of J −1 and velocity in units of a/J −1 where kB
is the Boltzmann constant.

III. RESULTS

The system is simulated for several temperatures and
anisotropy parameters.
In all of them we have ﬁxed
Jh = Js = J, J0 = 2J and α = 1. In the ﬁrst set of
simulations we use λs = λh = 1J and the site anisotropy
Ds = Dh = 0.1J, −0.1J to obtain a system with out-
of-plane (Ising-like) and in-plane (XY ) symmetries re-

FIG. 4: Vortex Density as a function of time for Dh =
Ds = 0.1J and λs = λs = 1J. The graphics from left
to right and top to bottom correspond to the temperatures
T = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6. The system has an out-of-plane
symmetry.

FIG. 5: Vortex Density as a function of time for Dh = Ds =
−0.1J and λs = λs = 1J. Temperatures are the same as in
ﬁgure 4. The system has an in-plane symmetry.

higher temperature the system is already saturated and
creating a new excitation demands more energy. For the
in-plane symmetry (Figure 5) the situation is opposite.
At low temperature there is no energy transfer to vortex
modes. Creating a vortex demands much energy because
the spin component of the vortex is almost whole in-
plane. At higher temperature the system is soft so that it
can absorb energy augmenting the vortex density. Even-
tually it reaches saturation at high enough temperature.
For the case when the vortex has an in-plane-symmetry
(λ < λc), shown in ﬁgure 6, the average vortex density is
constant even at higher temperatures. For (λ > λc) (Fig-
ure 7) the situation is similar to that where the system
has a global out-of-plane symmetry (Compare to ﬁgure
4).

In ﬁgure 8 we show the velocity of the head and the
vortex density as a function of time plotted in the same
graphic for some interesting situations. The vortex den-
sity is multiplied by a factor of 2 as a matter of clarity.
In the ﬁrst plot we observe that the kinetic energy of the
tip is transferred to the surface. The head stops, moves
back and forth and escapes from the surface inﬂuence.
At higher temperatures the situation is a bit more com-
plex. Depending on the initial condition the head passes
through the surface region just augmenting the vortex

density (8.b) or it can be trapped in the surface region,
as seen in ﬁgure 8.c. The cost for the increase in the
vortex density is a decrease in the kinetic energy.

In ﬁgure 9 a and b we show the velocity and vortex
density as a function of time for two diﬀerent initial ve-
locities (v = 0.6, 0.2 respectively), at the same tempera-
ture T = 0.2. For the higher velocity, the tip decreases
its velocity almost up to stop, however, its kinetic energy
is suﬃcient to go across the surface region. For a lower
velocity, ﬁgure 9.b, the tip collides elastically with the
surface. Because there is no lost in kinetic energy the
vortex density is conserved. We note that the increase
in the vortex density it is not an instantaneous response
to the diminishing of the kinetic energy of the tip.
It
may be due to an intermediate mechanism: The kinetic
energy is used to excite spin waves in the surface. Be-
cause there is no mechanism of energy dissipation, part
of the energy contained in the spin waves is transferred
to vortex excitations.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have used Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simula-
tion to study the interaction between two magnetic mo-
bil parts: a magnetic reading head dislocating close to
a magnetic surface. Our interest was to understand the

mechanism of heat dissipation when the forces involved in
the system are magnetic in essence. To simulate the sur-
face we have considered a magnetic crystalline substrate
interacting magnetically with a magnetic tip. From the
results presented above we have strong evidences that
vortices play an important role in the energy dissipation
mechanism in magnetic surfaces. The augmenting of the
vortex density excitations in the system increases its en-
tropy. That phenomenon can blur any information even-
tually stored in magnetic structures in the surface. An
interesting result is the velocity behavior of the tip pass-
ing close to the surface. In principle we should expect
that the velocity will always diminish, as an eﬀect of the
interaction with the surface. However, for certain initial

6

conditions the eﬀect is opposite. The tip can oscillate,
be trapped over the surface or even be repelled. In the
case of an elastic collision the vortex density remains un-
changed. If the vortex density increases the tip’s kinetic
energy diminishes. However, the increase in the vortex
density is not an instantaneous response to the diminish-
ing of the kinetic energy of the tip. We suspect that an
intermediate mechanism involving spin wave excitations
is present intermediating the phenomenon.

The eﬀects on friction observed in our simulations
demonstrate that when pure magnetic forces are involved
they are quite diﬀerent from ordinary friction. There are
two points that should be interesting to study: The ef-
fect of normal forces applied to the system and how the
observed eﬀects depend on the contacting area between
surfaces.

Explicit symplectic integrators for solving non-separable Hamiltonians.

Siu A. Chin
Department of Physics, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843, USA

By exploiting the error functions of explicit symplectic integrators for solving separable Hamilto-
nians, I show that it is possible to develop explicit, time-reversible symplectic integrators for solving
non-separable Hamiltonians of the product form. The algorithm is unusual in that it is of fractional
order.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Symplectic integrators1–4 are the methods of choice for solving diverse physical problems in classical1,5–7,
quantum8–15, and statistical16–19 mechanics. For separable Hamiltonians, the problem is well understood and many
explicit integrators are available1–4. However, for non-separable Hamiltonians, only implicit algorithms are known1–4.
It is generally believed that no explicit algorithms can be developed for solving non-separable Hamiltonians1,2. In this
work, I show that this is not the case. Explicit, time-reversible algorithms can be developed to solve a selected class
of non-separable Hamiltonians. The idea is to model non-separable Hamiltonians by the error terms of explicit algo-
rithms when solving separable Hamiltonians. By a suitable choice of factorization (or split) coeﬃcients, the explicit
algorithm can be made to solve error Hamiltonians which are generally non-separable.

In the usual study of symplectic integratiors, one seeks to eliminate error terms in order to produce higher order
algorithms. These error terms are therefore not of direct interest and are rarely studied in their own right. In this
work, these error terms are the non-separable Hamiltonians we seek to solve. The method can solve non-separable
Hamiltonians of the product form, (sum over repeated indices)

provided that

For one degree of freedom, given T ′(p) and V ′′(q), T (p) and V (q) can always be obtained by integration.

In the next section we will brieﬂy summarize essential aspects of symplectic integrators and their error functions,

followed by our explicit integrator for solving the above non-separable Hamiltonian.

Given a dynamical variable W (qi, pi) and a Hamiltonian function H(qi, pi), the former is evolved by the later via

the Poisson bracket, and therefore by the corresponding Lie operator20 ˆH associated with the function H(qi, pi),

with v0 =
2. There is one free parameter t2 that one can choose to
minimize the resulting error, but not be set to zero. As examplﬁed by (2.11) and (2.12), for a separable Hamiltonian
H = T + V , higher order brackets of the form
have opposite signs. Thus one should choose algorithms
V, Q
with eT Q = eV Q to maximize error cancellations19. This is the basis for symplectic corrector21 or processed22,23
algorithms. The choice of t2 =
1.82 forces eT T T T V = eV T T T V and would be a good starting value. The
RHS of (3.1) is the evolution operator for the non-separable Hamiltonian HT T V with time step ∆t = ε3 and error
terms O(ε5). Thus the parameter ε used by the integrator is ε = 3√∆t. Since ε5 = ∆t5/3, the order of the algorithm
(the error in the Hamiltonian) is only 2/3.

In both cases, the ﬁnal force or velocity can be

where the phase trajectory is harmonic near the origin, but highly distorted at larger values of (p, q). The algorithm’s

In Fig.1 we compare the phase trajectories produced by algorithm (3.1) with exact trajectories deduced from (3.4).
We set t2 =
2 and use a relatively large value of ∆t = 0.005 so that discrepances can be seen. The four trajectories
are started at p0 = 0 and q0 = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 respectively. The error is largest at the positive maximum of p
and next largest at the negative maximum of p. (Since the algorithm is time-reversible, it is surprising that the errors
at these two points are not identical.) In each case, the error can be further reduced by making t2 more negative than
-2. We did not bother with this reﬁnement here, but will be important in the 2D case discussed below. Notice that
the velocity of the algorithm’s Hamiltonian (3.5) is always positive, regardless of the sign of p. The fact that the ﬁnal
p can change sign is due entirely to the negative coeﬃcient t2.

In Fig.2, we demonstrate that the algorithm indeed converges as ∆t2/3. The case of p0 = 0 and q0 = 2.0 is computed
with four time step sizes ∆t = 0.005, 0.002, 0.001 and 0.0005. For each ∆t, the normalized energy error, after being
divided by ∆t2/3, is plotted as a function of t for one period (
1.53). If the power were truly ∆t2/3, then one should
0. This is indeed the case, although the convergence seemed rather slow.

The phase point is moving clock-wise; the two big error dips occur at the negative and the positive maximum of p
respectively and account for the greater trajectory discrepance near the positive maximum of p as seen in Fig.1.

This can again be solved by our explicit integrator (3.1). In two-dimension, most trajectories are not closed and are
likely to be chaotic. However, for some special initial conﬁgurations, a rich variety of closed orbits can be found.
Fig. 3 shows a sample of three such closed orbits. For this calculation, since the order of the algorithm is only 2/3,
reducing the step size is not eﬃcient in achieving higher accuaracy. Instead, we ﬁnd that the error can be substantially
reduced by changing t2 to
3. For the circle, triangle and the twisted orbits of Fig. 3, the step sizes used were,
∆t = 0.0012, 0.001, and 0.0005 respectively.

and only HT T V is non-separable. Here, Vij can be viewed as a position-dependent inverse mass matrix. This work
shows that If Vij can be derived from a potential function V (q), then this non-separable Hamiltonian can also be
solved by our explicit algorithm. Also, by itself, this quadratic Hamiltonian does not possess closed orbits for most
V (q), thus explaining why this error term would disrupt closed orbit of the original Hamiltonian at large ε.

IV. CONCLUDING SUMMARY

In this work, we have demonstrated that explicit symplectic integrators can be devised to solve a selected class
of non-separable Hamiltonians. Any non-separable Hamiltonian which can be modelled by the error terms of an
explicit integrator can be solved by the same integrator with changed split coeﬃcients. The algorithm, however, only
converges as ∆t2/3, which makes it essential to reduce the error ﬁrst by adjusting any free parameter of the algorithm.

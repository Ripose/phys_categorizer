Abstract

The estimation of the solution of a system of two diﬀerential equations introduced by Norton (1976)

that is equivalent to the Gompertz law is performed by means of the recent adaptive scheme of

Besan¸con and collaborators (2004). Results of computer simulations illustrate the robustness of

the approach.

I. GOMPERTZ GROWTH FUNCTIONS

Mathematically speaking, the Gompertz law refers to the class of functions having expo-

nentially decreasing logarithmic derivatives. It has been introduced in 1825 by B. Gompertz

in a paper on the law of human mortality [1]. He noted that for people between 40 and 100

years “the rate of mortality variable with age measures a force of death which grows each

year by a fraction, always the same, of its present value”. According to Winsor [2], the

possible application of the Gompertz curve in biology was ﬁrst spelled out in 1926 by Sewall

Wright in a few remarkable statements: “ In organisms, on the other hand, the damping oﬀ

of growth depends more on internal changes in the cells themselves ... The average growth

power as measured by the percentage rate of increase tends to fall at a more or less uniform

percentage rate, leading to asymmetrical types of s-shaped curves...”.

In a Nature letter on the growth of tumours, Norton et al [3] wrote the Gompertz law as

the system of the following two ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations

˙Z1 = K1Z1Z2

˙Z2 = −K2Z2 ,

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where Z = (Z1, Z2) ∈ R2, Ki > 0, Z1 is the volume of the tumour at time t, and Z2 is a

function entirely described by the second equation (2) that gives the diﬀerence in growth

with respect to a pure exponential law. According to Norton, K2Z2 gives the fraction of the

volume that doubles in size during the instant dt. Thus, Z2 that we call for obvious reasons

the Gompertzian exponent function is of special interest and we would like to determine it

even though we know neither the initial conditions for Z1 and Z2 nor K2. Norton et al wrote

the solution of the system in the following form

Z1(t) = Z1(0) exp

Z2(0) {1 − exp(−K2t)}

.

Z2 (cid:19)

it is clear that the applicability of Eqs. (3) and (4) depends on the knowledge of the initial

condition and the value of the parameter Ki. In this note, we overcome the latter inconve-

nience by applying the recent adaptive scheme for state estimation proposed in [5], in which

2

one supposes that the initial condition and the parameter K2 are unknown. In addition, it

seems quite natural to take as outputs of the system the states

y = h(Z) = Z1 ,

(5)

which in the case of tumours would correspond to their volume.

II. THE ADAPTIVE SCHEME

During the last decade, the problem of the estimation of the parameters in various types

of systems has motivated extensive studies of the design of adaptive observers for linear

as well as nonlinear systems. Recently, a globally convergent adaptive observer has been

developed for many systems. It originated from a non trivial combination of a nonlinear

high gain observer and a linear adaptive observer, see [4] and [5]. In this work, we present

an application of the high gain techniques in the context of state and parameter estimation

whatever the unknown parameter is.

The assumption on the considered class of systems are basically that if all of the parame-

ters were known, some high-gain observer could be designed in a classical way, and that the

system are “suﬃciently excited” in a sense which is close to the usually required assumption

on adaptive systems, that is signals should be dinamically rich enough so that the unknown

parameters can indeed be identiﬁed. In this particular case, the lack of persistent excita-

tion of the system could impede the reconstruction of the parameters. However, the recent

scheme developed by Besan¸con and collaborators [5] guarantee the accurate estimation of

To make this mathematically precise we have to introduce ﬁrst some terminology. Let

us construct the jth time derivative of the output. This can be expressed using Lie diﬀer-

entiation of the function h by means of the vector ﬁeld f given by the right hand sides of

the states.

Norton’s system

where Lf

j (h) (Z(t)) is the jth Lie derivative of h with respect to f . These Lie derivatives

is a diﬀeomorphism. For Φ(Z) to be a diﬀeomorphism on a region Ω, it is necessary and

suﬃcient that the Jacobian dΦ(Z) be nonsingular on Ω and that Φ(Z) be one-to-one from

Ω to Φ(Ω), see [6].

X = Φ(Z) in the following form

Since Φ(Z) is a diﬀeomorphism, one can write the global coordinate system deﬁned by

where X n ∈ R, ϕ(X) = (0, X2

of known functions and θ ∈ Rp is a vector of unknown parameters, or better say, it is a

2

vector whose values belong to some known compact set and should be estimated through

the measurements of the output y. We are here in the particular case n = 2, p = 1 and

also the algorithm we develop is a particular case of that presented in [5], since we can not

meddle in the system, in other words, there is no control input. We use as adaptive observer

the following system [5]

where σ(·) is a saturation function, Γ ∈ Rn×p, K is some vector that makes A − KC a stable
matrix, Λ = diag[1, ρ−1, . . . , ρ−(n−1)] and ρ ∈ R+ is a constant to be chosen. In [5], it is
proven that the dynamical system ˆ̥ is a global exponential adaptive observer for the system
̥, i.e., for any initial conditions X(t0), ˆX(t0), ˆθ(t0) and ∀θ ∈ Rp, the errors ˆX(t) − X(t) and
ˆθ(t) − θ(t) tend to zero exponentially fast when t → ∞. Taking K = [K1, K2], the matrix

A − KC have the following eigenvalues

Selecting K2 = (1/4) K1

K1 > 0 we turn A − KC into a stable matrix. Thus, the explicit form of the observer system

With the aim of better illustrating the adaptive scheme proposed here, we present nu-

merical simulations. We use the following values of the parameters: K1 = 1, K2 = 0.5,

ρ = 100 and K1 = 1. In Figs. (1) and (2), the solid lines represent the evolution of the true

states and the dotted lines stand for the evolution of the estimates, respectively.

of the true states Z1 and the dotted line represents the estimate ˆZ1. Plot (b) is a detail of (a) to

III. CONCLUSION

The robust adaptive scheme we used here for the interesting case of Gompertz growth

functions is a version of that due to Besan¸con et al. The results of this work indicate

that this scheme is very eﬃcient in obtaining the Gompertz functions without knowing both

6

initial conditions and parameter K2. The method may be useful in more general frameworks

for models of self-limited growth such as in the construction of a speciﬁc growth curve in

biology, or as a managerial tool in livestock enterprises, as well as in the understanding of

the growth of tumors.

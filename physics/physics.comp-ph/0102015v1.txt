(DRAFT: February 2, 2008)

Starting from an exact lower bound on the imaginary-time propagator, we present a Path-
Integral Quantum Monte Carlo method that can handle singular attractive potentials. We illustrate
the basic ideas of this Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm by simulating the ground state of hydrogen
and helium.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation is a powerful method for computing the ground state and non-zero
temperature properties of quantum many-body systems [1,2]. There are two fundamental problems that limit the
application of these methods. The ﬁrst and most important is the minus-sign problem on which we have nothing to
say in this paper, see however [3,4]. The second problem arises if one would like to simulate systems with attractive
singular potentials, the Coulomb interaction being the prime example. The purpose of this paper is to present an
approach that solves the latter problem, in a form that ﬁts rather naturally in the standard Path Integral QMC
(PIQMC) approach and leaves a lot of room for further systematic improvements.

Let us ﬁrst recapitulate the basic steps of the procedure to set up a PIQMC simulation. Writing K and V for the
kinetic and potential energy respectively the ﬁrst step is to approximate the imaginary-time propagator by a product
of short-time imaginary-time propagators. The standard approach is to invoke the Trotter-Suzuki formula [5,6]

where rm+1 = r1 and use has been made of the fact that the potential energy is diagonal in the coordinate represen-
tation. Taking the limit m → ∞, (3) yields the Feynman path integral [9] for a system with Hamiltonian H = K + V .
Expression (3) is the starting point for PIQMC simulation.

In the case the attractive Coulomb interaction, it is easy to see why the standard PIQMC approach fails. Let us

take the hydrogen atom as an example. The Hamiltonian reads

where q denotes the charge of the electron and M = me/(1 + me/mp), me (mp) being the mass of the electron
(proton). Replacing the imaginary-time free-particle propagator in (3) by its explicit, exact expression

PIQMC calculates ratio of integrals such as (6) by using a Monte Carlo procedure to generate the coordinates
{r1, . . . , rm}. The integrand in (6) serves as the weight for the importance sampling process. As the latter tends to

, the points {r1, . . . , rm} will, after
maximize the integrand, it is clear that because of the factors exp
a few steps, end up very close to the origin. In the case of a singular, attractive potential importance sampling based
on (6) fails. Using instead of the simplest Trotter-Suzuki formula (1) a more sophisticated one [8] only makes things
worse because these hybrid product formulae contain derivatives of the potential with respect to the coordinates.

The problem encountered in setting up a PIQMC scheme for models with a singular, attractive potential is just a
signature of the fundamental diﬃculties that arise when one tries to deﬁne the Feynman path integral for the hydrogen
atom [10]. The formal solution to this problem is known [10,11]. It is rather complicated and not easy to incorporate
in a PIQMC simulation.

In spirit the method proposed in this paper is similar to the one used to solve the hydrogen path integral: Use
the quantum ﬂuctuations to smear out the singularity of the potential. Mathematically we implement this idea by
applying Jensen’s inequality to the propagator [12]. Applications of the Feynman path-integral formalism are often
based on a combination of Jensen’s inequality and a variational approach [9,10] so it is not a surprise that similar
tricks may work for PIQMC as well.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we give a simple derivation of an exact lower bound on the
imaginary-time propagator. This inequality naturally deﬁnes a sequence of systematic approximations ˆZm to the
partition function. Although each ˆZm looks very similar to Zm, the former can be used for PIQMC with attractive,
singular potentials. For pedagogical reasons, in Section 3 we illustrate the approach by presenting an analytical
treatment of the harmonic oscillator. In Section 4 we give the explicit form of the approximate propagator for the
attractive Coulomb potential and present PIQMC results for the ground state of the hydrogen and helium atom.

II. LOWER BOUND ON THE PROPAGATOR

Consider a system with Hamiltonian H = K + V and a complete set of states {|xi} that diagonalizes the hermitian
operator V . In the case that V contains a singular attractive part we replace V = limǫ→0 Vǫ by a regular Vǫ(x) > −∞
and take the limit ǫ → 0 at the end of the calculation. Using the Trotter-Suzuki formula we can write

hx|e−τ (K+Vǫ)|x′i = lim

where τ = β/m. The simplest approximant ˆZ1 corresponds to the Feynman’s variational approximation to the full
Feynman path integral [9,10]. The main diﬀerence between (3) and (16) is that the bare potential e−τ V (x) is replaced
by an eﬀective potential that is obtained by convoluting the bare potential and free-particle propagators e−uK and
e−(τ −u)K. Convolution smears out singularities. As we show below, in the case of the attractive Coulomb interaction
expression (14) is ﬁnite, for any choice of x and x′. For the approximants ˆZm to be useful in PIQMC, it is necessary
that the integral over u can be done eﬃciently. In the next two sections we show how this can be done.

III. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE

It is instructive to have at least one example for which the details can be worked out analytically, without actually
using PIQMC. Not surprisingly this program can be carried out for the harmonic oscillator. For notational convenience
we will consider the one-dimensional model Hamiltonian H = K + V , with K = −(¯h2/2M )d2/dx2 and V = M ω2x2.
Calculating the matrix element hx|e−uK V e−(τ −u)K|x′i in (16) is a straightforward excercise in perfoming Gaussian
integrals [15]. We obtain

to the exact value E, an observation for which we have no mathematical justiﬁcation at this time.

with τ = β/m. As the integrands in (26) and (27) are always ﬁnite, expressions (26) and (27) can be used perform
PIQMC simulations.

In the path integral formalism the ground state energy is obtained by letting β → ∞ and β/m → 0, i.e. E =
ˆEm. Of course, in numerical work, taking one or both these limits is impossible.
In Tables 2
limβ→∞ limβ/m→0
and 3 we present numerical results of PIQMC estimates of the ground state energy E of the hydrogen and helium
atom. These results have been obtained from ﬁve statistically independent simulations of 100000 Monte Carlo steps
per degree of freedom each. The systematic errors due to the discretization of the path integral are hidden in the
statistical noise. The PIQMC procedure we have used is standard [1,7] except for a trick we have used to improve
the eﬃciency of sampling the paths, details of which are given in the appendix. Although a ground state calculation
pushes the PIQMC method to point of becoming rather ineﬃcient, the numerical results are in satisfactory agreement
with the known values.

V. DISCUSSION

We have show that is possible to perform PIQMC simulations for quantum systems with attractive Coulomb
potentials. Instead of the conventional Trotter-Suzuki formula approach one can use (16) to construct a path integral
that is free of singularities. In practice, a numerical calculation of the latter requires only minor modiﬁcations of a
standard PIQMC code.

The eﬃciency of the PIQMC method describe above can be improved with relatively modest eﬀorts. Instead of using
the free-particle propagator K, we are free to pick any other model Hamiltonian H0 for which the matrix elements of
e−τ H0 are positive and integrals involving these matrix elements are known analytically. An obvious choice would be
to take for H0 a set of harmonic oscillators. The matrix elements of e−τ H0 are Gaussians and hence the conditions
used to derive (14) are satisﬁed. If necessary the approximant ˆZm can be improved further by optimization of the
parameters of the oscillators. For m = 1 this approach is identical to the variational method proposed by Feynman
and Kleinert [18–21] and independently by Giachetti and Tognetti [22,23]. Extending the PIQMC method in this
direction is left for future research.

APPENDIX

In PIQMC the simplest mehod for sampling paths is to change one degree of freedom at each Monte Carlo step.
Usually this is rather ineﬃcient and one adds Monte Carlo moves that make global changes of the path, e.g. moves that
resembles the classical motion. In this appendix we present a more sophisticated scheme which we found performed
very well at very low temperature. The basic idea is to change variables such that the kinetic energy term in the path
integral becomes a diagonal quadratic form, i.e.

m

Xk=1

(xk − xk+1)2 =

y2
k,

m

Xk=2

where xm+1 = x1. After some straightforward algebra one ﬁnds that the transformation from the {xi} to the {yi} is
given by

y2
k =

m − k + 2
m − k + 1

xk −

(m − k + 1)xk−1 + xm+1
m − k + 2

(cid:18)

.

(cid:19)

The expression for xk in terms of the {ui} reads

xk = y1 +

m − j + 2

(cid:18)

yj,

1 < k ≤ m,

with x1 = y1. From (30) we conclude that the computational work for making a global change of the path (i.e.
simultaneously changing all yi) is linear in m, hence optimal. It is also clear that the variable y1 plays the role of the
“classical” position. The variables y2, . . . , ym describe the quantum ﬂuctuations.

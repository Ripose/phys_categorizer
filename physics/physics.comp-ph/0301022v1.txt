MORPHOLOGY OF THE UNIVERSAL FUNCTION FOR THE
CRITICAL CIRCLE MAP
R. Delbourgo and Brian G. Kenny
University of Tasmania, GPO Box 252-21, Hobart, AUSTRALIA 7001

We describe the morphology of the universal function for the critical
(cubic) circle map at the golden mean, paying particular attention to the
birth of inﬂection points and their reproduction. In this way one can fully
understand its intricacies.

Abstract

Introduction

At the critical point, the circle map has a cubic order of inﬂection. Near the
golden mean winding number the self-reproducing (renormalization group) prop-
erties of the Fibonacci mode-locked steps [1] leads to the notion of a universal
circle map function g(x), which has received a great deal of study in the litera-
ture [2, 3, 4]. It obeys the compatible [5] pair of functional equations,

g (g(x)) = g(α2x)/α,

g(g(x)/α2) = g(αx)/α2.

(2)

The universal circle map constant α = −1.288575.. [2] can be determined to
extremely high accuracy [6] by examining the equations over a restricted range
of x. In this paper however we focus on the behaviour of g(x) over large x, in
order to make sense of its morphology. Some years ago we tried a similar analysis
for the period-doubling universal function [7]; our aim here is to comprehend
how the ever-increasing number of inﬂection points are spawned as we go out
to ever larger |x|. We shall see that they can be discovered directly by a close
look at the functional equations and their derivatives, starting from previously
known series of inﬂection points.

In the next section we quickly recapitulate the origin and character of the
functional equations and derive the principal features, including the ﬁrst family
of inﬂection points. In the last section we locate the higher families of inﬂection
points of g and explain how successive ones are derived theoretically. In this way
one can better appreciate the morphology of the universal circle map function
and comprehend its complicated structure.

Origin and Main features

The approach to the irrational golden mean winding number in nonlinear maps
of an angular variable θ is normally made [1] via a succession of Fibonnaci
number ratios: Fn−1/Fn as n → ∞. In particular for the critical circle map,

′

θ → θ

= f (θ, Ω) ≡ Ω + θ − sin(2πθ)/2π,

(3)

with a cubic inﬂection point at the origin, it is conventional to work out the
superstable values of the driving frequencies Ωn which lead to the rational
Fn−1/Fn,

Fn−1(0, Ωn) − Fn = 0.

∆θn ≡ [f ]

Fn−2(0, Ωn) − Fn−1

is the nearest ﬁxed point to the origin. The universal Feigenbaum constants δ, α
of the map are then obtained [2] as

δ = limn→∞ ∆Ωn/∆Ωn−1 = −2.833612..;

∆Ωn ≡ Ωn − Ωn−1,

α = lim
n→∞

∆θn/∆θn−1 = −1.288575..

Parenthetically, we note the numerical value Ω∞ = 0.6066610635..

By considering the set of functions

n
φr(θ) = α

(cid:0)[f ]

n
Fn(Ωn+r, θ/α

) − Fn−1(cid:1) ,

in the limit of large n and taking the limit as r → ∞, one may establish that the
limiting (Shenker) function φ, evaluated at Ω∞, obeys two compatible functional
equations,

φ (φ(θ)/α) = φ(αθ)/α2

and

φ (αφ(θ)) = φ(α2θ)/α.

Numerical approximations to (8) indicate that the function φ(x) (called f (x)
by Shenker) is a monotonically increasing function of its argument; therefore
the alternative function g(x) = αφ(x) decreases monotonically with x and one
readily establishes that it satisﬁes the universal equations (1,2). At the same
time one may easily show that the scaled function G(x) = g(ρx)/ρ obeys the
self-same equation pair (9,10); thus one is at liberty to set the normalization
scale at will. We shall ﬁx the unique zero of g(x) at x = 1, that is g(1) = 0,
and thereby ﬁnd the value g(0) ≡ λ = 1.2452.. to be the intercept at the origin.
Because of the cubic nature of inﬂection, g′(0) = g′′(0) = 0.

Plots of g(x) in the ranges -8 to -4, -4 to +4, +4 to +8 are respectively given
in Figures 1, 2 and 3. These plots are approximate and they were obtained from
equation (8) by going to high order (n = 14) at the accumulation point Ω∞ and
scaling appropriately in x, as indicated above. (The range -8 to 8 was chosen
so that we have suﬃciently many inﬂection points to make the investigation
of the morphology worthwhile, but not too many to confuse the subsequent
discussion.) Two signiﬁcant points may be noted from these plots:

• they exhibit a series of inﬂection points which are self-similar and which

proliferate on ever smaller (and larger) scales as we go out in x,

• the function behaves asymptotically as g(x) ≃ αx.

The last fact is readily veriﬁed from the initial functional equations (1) and
(2); our goal is to understand the ﬁrst fact, namely the origin and families of
inﬂection points. Before doing so let us derive a number of useful facts about g
at particular locations, some of which are required later. By evaluating (1) at
x = 1/α2 and (2) at x = 1/α, one readily discovers that

g(1/α2) = 1,

g(1/α) = α2;

the former also follows from (2) evaluated at x = 1/α2. Taking (1) and (2) at
x = 1, leads to

g(α2) = αλ,

g(α) = α2λ,

the former following from (1a) evaluated at x = 1/α. Finally, we note that
working out (1) and (2) at x = 0, gives

g(λ) = λ/α,

g(λ/α2) = λ/α2.

The latter condition demonstrates that λ/α2 is the (single) ﬁxed point of the
universal circle function! Further relations between g(λαM ) can be found by
substituting suitable x = αN in eqs. (1), but we will not need them below.
As the next step, diﬀerentiate equations (1,2) to obtain the related pair,

(11)

(12)

Remember that where g has zero ﬁrst derivative, its second derivative also
vanishes (because the map is cubic), so equations (11,12) provide information
about the inﬂection points. A number of interesting values of the derivatives
can be obtained immediately. Setting x = 1/α2 in (11) and x = 1/α in (12)
yields

′

g

(1/α2) = α,

′

g

(1/α) = α

and one can check the correctness of these values from the graphs. Also, taking
the limit as x → 0 in (11,12), one deduces that

′

g

(λ) = α5,

′

g

(λ/α2) = α3,

because the inﬂection point is cubic. By similar means one may establish rela-
tions between derivatives of g at various points x = αM λ which provide useful
checks on numerical work.

But one can go further through the following observation: if ξ corresponds
to an inﬂection point, (11) and (12) ensure that αξ and α2ξ are also inﬂec-
tion points; by induction one generates an entire sequence of such points, viz.

3

αnξ, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. However equation (11) at x = 1 and (12) at x = 0, inform
us that

′

g

(α2) = 0,

′

g

(α) = 0,

so we conclude that ξn ≡ αn, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . represent a family of inﬂection
points, seeded by ξ1 = α; for our purposes we shall regard them as the primary
or parent series. These points can be picked out in Table 1, where we have listed
all the inﬂection points that occur between x = −8 to +8 and they can also be
spotted in the ﬁgures as marked dots. This table contains many more inﬂection
points and the question is: how are they seeded? The answer will be provided
in the next section.

Families of inﬂection points

Examination of the ﬁgures shows that not all inﬂection points belong to the
primary sequence αN . The ﬁrst non-standard inﬂection point occurs at x ≃
2.25 and to see where this comes from we examine ﬁrst the seed values xN ≡
g−1(αN ), N = 1, 2, . . . . These may be read oﬀ from the graph of g and are
tabulated in Table 2. At those locations,

′

g

(g(xN )) = g

(α

) = 0,

′

N

and from (11) we are assured that the set αM xN , M = 2, 3, . . . will generate
a family of inﬂection points, some of which may not be new. [For example we
note again that the location x2 = 1/α simply generates the primary or parent
family.] The ﬁrst daughter family, which is new, is given by the secondary series,
α2x1, α3x1, . . .; another daughter family, which is also new, corresponds to the
sequence, αx3, α2x3, . . ., etc. and it starts oﬀ with M = 1, by virtue of equation
(12). However the family αnx4 is not new because one may readily establish
that x4 = αx1 by inserting x = x1 in equation (12). New secondary families
αnx5, αnx6, . . . etc. begin with n = 1, again via equation (12).

While the parent and daughter sequences lead to two generations of inﬂection
points, some of which are listed in Table 1, this does not exhaust the class of
such points. Proceeding in a similar fashion to above, deﬁne the granddaughter
sequence,

xMN ≡ g

−1(α

M

xN ) = g

−1

M

N
−1(α

g

(cid:0)α

)(cid:1) .

(13)

Many of these points are not new; by manipulating (8a) and (8b) appropriately,
one may prove that some daughters are identical with or related to their aunts.
For instance,

αx21 = x3, αx31 = x6, αx25 = x7,

x15 = x6,

x43 = αx6, . . .

As well, some of these granddaughters are interrelated; for instance

αx13 = x41, αx16 = x51, . . .

4

Only the independent αnxMN occurring between -8 and +8 are stated in Table
1.

Practically all the remaining missing points of inﬂection in that range arise
from the next generation, xLMN ≡ g−1 (cid:0)αLxMN (cid:1) . Again we have only listed
those that spawn new series. The ﬁnal ‘missing’ point within -8 to 8, at x ≃
−7.45, is noteworthy because it belongs to the ‘fourth’ generation. By following
through this procedure one may track all the inﬂection points over any desired
range, with each family being generated from the previous one, though many are
identiﬁed with previous members; for example the point α2x241 is the same as
its aunt αx61. Within the restricted range -8 to 8, there are no other inﬂection
points beyond the ones noted in the table. An interesting observation is that the
number of inﬂection points between αn and αn+2 equals the Fibonnaci number
Fn; while we can readily show that this holds for subcritical maps where α is
the inverse of the golden mean ratio, an exact proof eludes us for critical cubic
maps.

All told we can see how the functional equations reproduce their structure
in a self-similar way, becoming ever more intricate and extended at one and the
same time: for instance, the region between -7.7 and -7.4 looks very much like
the region between -2 and 2. This feature happens everywhere and is not unlike
the morphology of the period-doubling universal function. We expect that the
cubic nature of inﬂection is not vital for the validity of this conclusion and that
it is common to all scaling functional equations of the type [g]N (x) ∝ g(ρx).
The exquisite self-similarity on every scale as we go out in x means that it is
eﬀectively impossible to make an analytical approximation to g over a wide
range of x; but of course over a small, limited range it is always possible to
do so and indeed this is a sensible way to compute the scaling constant α, by
focussing on the region x = 0 to 1 say.

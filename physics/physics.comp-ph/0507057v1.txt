We consider the radiation transfer problem in the discrete-ordinate, plane-parallel approach. We
introduce two benchmark problems with exact known solutions and show that for strongly non-
homogeneous media the homogeneous layers approximation can lead to errors of 10% in the estima-
tion of the intensity. We propose and validate a general purpose numerical method that transforming
the two-boundary problem into an initial boundary problem, using an adaptative step integration
and an interpolation of the local optical properties, can improve the accuracy of the solution up to
two orders of magnitude. This is furthermore of interest for practical applications, such as atmo-
spheric radiation transfer, where the scattering and absorbing properties of the media vary strongly
with height and are only known, based on measurements or models, at certain discrete points.

INTRODUCTION

The mathematical modeling of radiative transfer in which the phenomena of absorption, emission and scat-
tering are taken into account is usually made using the linearized Boltzmann equation, also known as radiation
transfer equation. This equation describes the transfer of radiation, with a given wavelength, through a medium
with certain absorbing and scattering properties. A particular application of this equation is the study of ra-
diation transfer in the atmosphere, where the medium properties vary strongly with height. Getting accurate
solutions of this problem is important for evaluating energy balance on planetary atmospheres as well as for
the so called ”inverse problem” where the boundary conditions (in particular the ground albedo properties) are
deduced from measurements of radiation and knowledge of the medium characteristics.

In this work we consider the time-independent, monochromatic radiative transfer equation using the well-
tested and widely used discrete-ordinate method of Stamnes et al.
[1] and the plane parallel approach where
the optical properties depend only on the vertical coordinate z. The procedure requires the solution of a system
of n coupled linear ordinary diﬀerential equations (one for each stream or discrete-ordinate component of the
intensity). This set of equations is subject to a two-point boundary condition at the top and bottom of the
medium. In the general case no analytic solutions exist for this problem since the medium optical properties
(phase function, absorption and scattering coeﬃcients) depend on the position z in the vertically inhomogeneous
medium.

To obtain a formal solution, the medium is generally assumed to be layered with piecewise constant optical
it is divided into N adjacent homogeneous layers where the eigenvalues are computed. The

coeﬃcients of the solution are determined by imposing the continuity condition at the boundaries between
adjacent layers and the two-point boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the medium [2, 3].

Unfortunately in many cases the optical properties of the medium are not homogeneous, in fact they show
strong variations along the vertical axis and have therefore diﬀerent characteristic length scales. In these cases,
as we will see below, the homogeneous layers assumption may lead to errors of 10% in the estimation of the
scattered radiation. Furthermore in most practical applications the medium characteristics are only known,
based on measurements or calculations, at a discrete number of points [4]. It is therefore required to implement
a method that is able to cope both with the strong variations on the medium properties and with the discrete
character of the information available.

Here we solve the discrete-ordinate approximation to the radiative transfer equation with a diﬀerent approach.
Since the equations and the boundary conditions are linear in the intensity, the two-point boundary problem
can be solved with a shooting method. The problem is then reduced to the solution of an initial value problem
which can be solved numerically. We propose a numerical integration of the initial value problem that applies
an adaptive step method (such as step doubling), interpolates the optical properties from the discrete set of
available data (for example using a cubic spline) and uses a weighted evaluation of the integrand along the
interval (in our case a 5th order Runge-Kutta scheme). This allows the adaptation of the numerical integration
to the local characteristic length-scales of the problem under consideration. The assumption of homogeneity is
thus not required.

As an example we apply this method to solve the two-stream discrete ordinate version of the, non-emitting,
radiative transfer equation in one spatial dimension (these results can be equivalently extended to multi-stream
and emitting versions of this equation). We present two benchmark cases with known analytical solutions and
compare the performance obtained when the step doubling interpolating method is used and when the piecewise
homogeneity is imposed. We will show that using the same available discrete information, our method can
signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of the solution. In section II we will ﬁrst introduce the radiative transfer
equation and the equations for the direct and diﬀuse intensity components in the two-stream discrete ordinate
approach. In section III we will describe two benchmark cases characterized by linear and exponential height
dependence of the optical coeﬃcients in the equations. In section IV we will explain our numerical procedure
and will validate our results and those obtained under the assumption of piecewise homogeneous layers against
the exact analytical solutions of the benchmark problems. Finally conclusions are presented in section V.

II. MULTIPLE SCATTERING AND THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATION

Our aim is to solve the radiative transfer problem in the plane parallel approach. As represented in Figure 1
this corresponds to the case in which optical properties only depend on altitude z in a plane parallel geometry.

Following for instance [1] the radiative transfer equation in this approach is written as,

scattering eﬀects and βT (z, λ) is the extinction coeﬃcient deﬁned as βT (z, λ) = βsca(z, λ) +
the summation in i extents to all the molecular components considered. Here βi(z, λ) = ni(z)σi(λ) is the
absorption coeﬃcient of a given component, σi(λ) is the attenuation cross section due to absorption and ni(z)

Eq. (1), p(z, θ, φ, z′, θ′, φ′, λ) is the phase function of the scattering particles which is normalized as follows:

cos Θ = cos θ′ cos θ + sin θ′ sin θ cos(φ − φ′).

The solution of Eq. (1) is splitted into two terms

I dir(z, λ), the direct intensity, is the solution of Eq. (1) when there is no multiple scattering (no integral term):

I(z, θ, φ, λ) = I dir(z, λ) + I dif (z, µ, φ, λ).

where µ0 is the cosine of the polar angle for the incident radiation. The diﬀuse intensity is the solution of

with µ = cos θ. In this equation the variable µ takes values in the range −1 < µ < 1. Negative µ corresponds
to radiation going downwards, whereas positive µ describes radiation going upwards.
In order to solve Eq.

In the discrete ordinate approximation the angular integral term in Eq. (6) is represented by a summation
over n Gaussian quadrature points µs (ﬁxed angles) also called ”streams”. The intensity given by Eq. (5) must
satisfy boundary conditions at the top (z = zmax) and bottom (z = 0) of the medium. Therefore we end up
with a system of n coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations of the type (5), one for each stream µs, and subject
to a two-point boundary condition. Solving these equations, we will get a discrete approximation to the angular
distribution of I m(z, µ) from the top of the atmosphere to the surface level.

In this work, for simplicity, we will consider the two-stream approximation to this problem and obtain the
two streams I m(z, µ1) (downwards) and I m(z, µ2) (upwards) fulﬁlling the boundary conditions that impose,
ﬁrst, no diﬀuse radiation incident at the top, and second, no radiation reﬂected back at the surface. This is
expressed as follows,

III. THE BENCHMARK PROBLEMS

In this section we deﬁne three benchmark problems with an exact solution where the optical properties
βT (z, λ) and βsca(z, λ) in Eq. (1) have diﬀerent altitude (z) dependences. For the sake of simplicity we consider
that particles scatter radiation uniformly, i.e. the scattering phase function is p(cos Θ) = 1 and that zmax = 1.
For the integral part in Eq. (6) and following the two-stream approximation we consider a weighted summation
(3) (up) which are the zeroes of the second order Legendre
over the streams µ1 = −1/
polynomial, i.e. P2(µi) = 0, i = 1, 2. Then, Eq. (5) can be transformed in two coupled ordinary diﬀerential
equations for the down (I1) and up (I2) radiation intensity:

and I0 is ﬁxed by the condition at the top I dir(z = 0). In the following examples we will solve this problem with
the two-point boundary conditions given in Eqs. (7)-(8), which are now explicitely written as I1(z = 0) = 0 (at
the top) and I2(z = 1) = 0 (at the bottom). The incident intensity on the top is characterized by I0 = 100 and
µ0 = −0.788. We will consider two diﬀerent height dependences of the optical properties.

We propose as study-case a linear dependence on the extinction coeﬃcients. In particular we have considered

the functions A(z) and B(z),

intensity as a function of height. The two-stream components of the diﬀused intensity are shown in Fig. 3-I.

B. Exponential dependence

In atmospheric layers the gas density typically depends on the altitude as a growing exponential from z = 0
(the top) to z = 1 (the bottom). For this reason the choice of exponential dependence in the extinction
coeﬃcients is very convenient as it allows us to validate our method with solutions similar to those appearing
in atmospheres, where our method has been applied [4]. In particular we have chosen,

τ ≈ 3. The optical functions βT (z) and βT (z) are shown in Fig. 2-I and the direct intensity in Fig. 2-II. The
two-stream components of the diﬀused intensity are shown in Fig. 3-II.

IV. THE NUMERICAL METHOD

In contrast to the examples discussed above, where the optical properties of the media are known functions,
in the general case the medium optical properties are only known, based on measurements or models, at a
discrete set of points.
In order to solve the radiative transfer equation, it is generally assumed that these
optical properties are piecewise constant in a layer around the point, i.e. that the plane parallel layers are
homogeneous piecewise. As we shall see later this should not be assumed in the case of atmospheric layers,
where the optical properties show a strong (exponential) altitude dependence. We therefore propose to solve the
problem numerically, using an adaptative step procedure and interpolating the optical values where necessary.
Equation (3) is an initial value problem and it is easily integrated knowing the incident intensity on the
top I0. Equations (12)-(13) and their boundary conditions constitute a two-point boundary problem which
can be solved for instance with a shooting method as those explained in [5, 6]. For problems with linear
boundary conditions, shooting methods are able to get the exact solution in few steps. We choose values for all
the variables at one boundary, which must be consistent with any boundary condition there, but are otherwise
arranged to depend on arbitrary free parameters whose initial values are guessed. We then integrate the ordinary
diﬀerential equations with initial value methods, arriving at the other boundary, and adjust the free parameters
at the starting point that zeros the discrepancies at the other boundary. Thanks to this procedure the problem
is reduced to the solution of an initial value problem where no assumption of piecewise homogeneity is required.
The numerical integration of the equation for the direct component (3) and of the set of n ordinary diﬀerential
equations (5) for the diﬀused streams is done with a ﬁfth-order Runge-Kutta (RG) scheme with variable step [7].
Given a equation dIi
dz = f (z, Ii) where Ii(z) is known, the RG scheme uses a weighted average of approximated
values of f (z, Ii) at several points within the interval (z, z + dz) to obtain Ii(z + dz).
In contrast to other
methods where piecewise homogeneity is required, this method takes into account the variation along the layer
of integration of the diﬀused intensity streams, the direct component and the medium characteristics. For

the adaptative step control we use a ”step doubling” technique: the local error is estimated by comparing a
solution obtained with a ﬁfth-order scheme and the one obtained with a fourth-order method. The integrating
step is halved if this error is above a desired tolerance. Next, given the tabulated function βT,i = βT (zi) and
βsca,i = βsca(zi) with i = 1...N , we interpolate to obtain the new values at the locations required by the RG
and the adaptative step doubling integration scheme. We have chosen a cubic interpolating spline which allows
the interpolating formula to be smooth in the ﬁrst derivative, and continuous in the second derivative, both
within the interval and at its boundaries [5].

As an example, next we solve for the direct and diﬀused intensity in the two benchmark problems explained
in section III. For problems with optical depths of the order of τ ≈ 1, standard calculations based on the
homogeneous layer approximation divide the medium into N = 10 homogeneous layers [2]. We will analyze
problems of τ ≈ 3 and keep a similar ratio for our comparisons, we will then increase the number of layers. The
tabulated optical properties βT (zi), βsca(zi) at N equidistant zi points are given as input.

A summary of the maximal relative error E(I) = |I num

for the benchmark problems as a
function of the method and number of initial layers is given in table I. We compare the relative error in the
solution where piecewise homogeneity is assumed with the one obtained with our RG, step doubling, interpo-
lating method. Figure 4 shows the relative error as a function of height z for the step doubling interpolating

the piecewise homogeneous approximation leads to errors of the order of 10% which can be reduced to 1% by
increasing this ratio to N/τ ≈ 80. The step doubling interpolating RG technique permits the adaption of the
numerical integration to the local characteristic length-scales of the medium and, for the same input, increases
the accuracy of the solution between one and two orders of magnitude allowing for fast and accurate radiative
transfer calculations.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We have considered the discrete-ordinate approach to the radiation transfer equation. In view of our cal-
culations the error in the plane parallel approach, assuming N piecewise homogeneous layers, with N ≈ 10τ
can go up to 10% of the diﬀused intensity and thus the inhomogeneities in the atmosphere cannot be ignored.
We have validated a general purpose numerical method that, based on an adaptative step integration and an
interpolation of the local optical properties, can signiﬁcantly improve (up to two orders of magnitude) the ac-
curacy of the solution. This is furthermore of interest for practical applications, such as atmospheric radiation
transfer, where the scattering and absorbing properties of the media are only known, based on experiments
or theoretical models, at certain discrete points. Furthermore, this numerical method can be straightforward
extended to multiple streams, non trivial boundary conditions and non uniform scattering function allowing for
fast and accurate solutions of the radiative transfer equation.

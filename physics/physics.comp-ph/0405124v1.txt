A New Time-Reversible Integrator for Molecular Dynamics Applications

Vasilii Zhakhovskii

INRODUCTION

It is convenient to introduce notations:

Nowadays Molecular Dynamics (MD) approach is
widely applied in many areas of physics, chemistry and
biochemistry.
The MD method is based on solution
of second order differential equations of motion, this is
why the integration algorithm is a cornerstone of the MD
method [1]. The Newtonian equations of motion are time-
reversible and it would be reasonable to preserve this es-
sential property in our integration schemes. Since 1990
there are many nice symplectic integrators were invented
[2], mainly in force-gradient form but none with higher-
order gradient operators. In this short report we derive a
new time-reversible explicit integrator on the basis of sec-
ond order Tailor expansion of force. There is good reason
to think the new method will be easy-to-use for MD and,
possibly, celestial mechanics applications.

IDEA OF A NEW METHOD

Consider the second order differential equation:

¨x = f (x)

It is useful to introduce the function s(t) :

s(t) =

1 + t/h, −h < t < 0
0 < t < h
1 − t/h,

(cid:26)

(1)

(2)

x0 = x(0),
δx0 = x0 − x−h,
v(t) = ˙x(t),

xh = x(h),

x−h = x(−h)

δxh = xh − x0

a(t) = ¨x(t),

b(t) = ˙a(t)

(6)

f0 = f (x0),
f ′(x) = df (x)/dx,

fh = f (xh),

2
f ′′(x) = d

f−h = f (x−h)
2
f (x)/dx

Thus the Verlet method (4) is given by

δxh = δx0 + a0h

+ O(h

)

(7)

Expand f (x) in the vicinity of x = x0 and x(t)

at a point t = 0 in a Taylor series

f (x) = f0+f ′

0(x−x0)+f ′′

0 (x−x0)2/2+f ′′′

0 (x−x0)3/6+..
(8)

x − x0 = v0t + a0t2/2 + b0t3/6 + ..

(9)

Substitute (x − x0) from Eq.(9) to Eq.(8) and hold
only the even terms so one may ﬁnd that the function feven
along the trajectory of motion around t = 0 is

feven(t) = f0 + (a0f ′

0 + v2

0f ′′

0 )t2/2 + O(t4)

(10)

Substitute Eq.(10) to Eq.(3) and integrate the latter:

h

Z

−h

t2s(t)dt = h4/6

c0 ≡ a0f ′

By using Eq.(1) one may integrate by parts the integral

and

and ﬁnally

x(−h) − 2x(0) + x(h) = h

A proper approximation of the function f (x) in the Eq.(3)
within the segment t ∈ [−h, h] may give us difference
schemes for numerical integration of Eq.(1). For instance,
by assuming f (x) ≈ f (x(0)) , the exact formula (3) im-
mediately gives the explicit Verlet integrator:

δxh = δx0 + a0h2 + c0h4/12 + O(h6)
The explicit integrator (11) is time-reversible likewise the
Verlet method. The important difference of Eq.(11) from
Verlet formula (4) is a velocity dependence in the c0 co-
efﬁcient.

(11)

How to evaluate velocity vh ?
1st way. By using the same approach as above for

derivation of (11) one may deduce a formula

vh = v−h +

f (x)dt.

(12)

h

Z

−h

Therefore the time-reversible velocity formula is

x(−h) − 2x(0) + x(h) = f (x(0))h

2

(4)

vh = v−h + f02h + (a0f ′

0 + v2

0f ′′

0 )h3/3 + O(h5) (13)

Because Eq.(4) is symmetric for t ± h the Verlet method
is time-reversible. In the case of time quadratic approxima-
tion of f (x(t)) the implicit Stoermer method is derived
from Eq.(3):

The main disadvantage of Eq.(13) is a poor accuracy.

2nd way. Assume that in the vicinity of t = 0 the

x(t) can be represented by polynomial interpolation:

x(t) = x0 + v0t + a0t2/2 + c3t3 + c4t4 + c5t5 + c6t6

x(−h) − 2x(0) + x(h) =
= (f (x(−h)) + 10f (x(0)) + f (x(h)))h2/12

(5)

By using the known positions, velocities, and accelerations
at points t = [−h, 0, h] (see Table 1) one can derive a

Eq.(14) is more accurate than Eq.(13), but it requires the
knowledge of position and acceleration at t = h . The
general scheme of the new integrator on the basis of formu-
lae (11,14) is presented in the Table 2. The ﬁrst time-step
has to be done by using another integrator.

VECTOR FORMULAE

Again let us consider the second order differential

equation in vector notation:

¨r = f (r)/m = a

(15)

Eqs.(2,8,9) can be rewritten as vector equations:

δrh = δr0 +

f (r)s(t)dt.

For evaluation of velocity one may again use Eq.(14) and
the general scheme of integration (see Table 2).

1st example

Consider the forces depending only on distance r = |r|
f (r) = f (r) r

We need the following vector identities

2nd example

Let us consider the Molecular Dynamics system of N par-
ticles with pair-wise interaction. In the vector notation N
equations of motion are given by

mi¨ri =

f (rij ) rij

obtain

∆r = v0t + a0t2/2 + b0t3/6 + ...
(18)
As it was for Eq.(10), substitute ∆r from Eq.(18) to
Eq.(17) and hold only the even terms

f (r0 + ∆r)even = f0 +

MOLECULAR DYNAMICS TESTING

We have performed a practical test of the new method
to estimate its applicability for MD simulation problem.
The pair potential for our model system is described by the
popular Lennard-Jones (LJ) pair potential with truncation
at cut-off distance rc :

φLJ (r) = 4ǫ

(σ/r)
h
φtr(r) = φLJ (r) − φLJ (rc)

− (σ/r)

i
if 0 < r ≤ rc,

(31)

where σ and ǫ are the usual LJ parameters. Hereafter, we
use these parameters and the mass m/48 as reduced MD
units. To minimize numerical error at cut-off radius we set
it to the quite long distance rc = 8.5 . Number of atoms
is ﬁxed N = 3375 and all of them are located inside the
MD simulation cube L = 2rc with imposed periodical
conditions. Before testing the MD system is thermalized
at T = 1.2 and stored on disk. This thermodynamically
equilibrium state is the starting point of all testing runs.

For comparison purposes we choose Verlet algorithm

in the coordinate form Eqs.(32,33):

+ O(h

)

δxh = δx0 + a0h
xh = x0 + δxh
ah = f (xh)/m

(32)
(33)

(34)
vh = (δxh + δx0)/2h + (ah + 2a0)h/3 + O(h4) (35)

To improve the local energy conservation in the Verlet
scheme the particle velocity vh is evaluated by using ac-
curate Eq.(35) which does not affect the trajectory simula-
tion (see [3]).

The new integrator is chosen in the form of Eqs.(14,
29, 30) with step-by-step algorithm from the Table 2. Un-
fortunately, the new method requires, in principle, the dou-
ble run over all i ∈ {1, .., N } particles to evaluate ai and

cij . According to our simulations it takes approx-
ci =
imately 2 times more computer time than it takes for the
P
Verlet scheme.

Figures 1,2 show the timing data of several simula-
tion runs for different time steps. Fig.1 indicates that root-
mean-square accuracy of the new method is the superior,
but the new method takes almost twice as much of CPU
time. We evaluate the relative efﬁciency of the method by
comparing timings required for simulation of the same MD
time by the new method and Verlet method at given accu-
racy. The results are demonstrated in Fig.2 . For given test
the new integrator becomes more efﬁcient if the desired ac-
curacy is better than 5 × 10−5 . For instance, at the pre-
scribed accuracy 10−6 the new method takes 4 times less
computer time than the Verlet algorithm.

CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated that the new integrator is time-
reversible and very accurate. It can be efﬁciently applied
for highly precise MD simulations. The new method is ex-
pected to be useful for simulation of celestial mechanics
problems too.

It should be noted that Eq.(30) was obtained ﬁrst in

[4], but it was used in a time-irreversible algorithm.

Abstract

The mesocrystal showing both electrorheological and magnetorheological

eﬀects is called electro-magnetorheological (EMR) solids. Prediction of the

overall magnetic properties of the EMR solids is a challenging task due to

the coexistence of the uniaxially anisotropic behavior and structural transi-

tion as well as long-range interaction between the suspended particles. To

consider the uniaxial anisotropy eﬀect, we present an anisotropic Kirkwood-

Fr¨ohlich equation for calculating the eﬀective permeabilities by adopting an

explicit characteristic spheroid rather than a characteristic sphere used in the

derivation of the usual Kirkwood-Fr¨ohlich equation. Further, by applying an

Ewald-Kornfeld formulation we are able to investigate the eﬀective permeabil-

ity by including the structural transition and long-range interaction explicitly.

Our theory can reduce to the usual Kirkwood-Fr¨ohlich equation and Onsager

equation naturally. To this end, the numerical simulation shows the validity

of monitoring the structure of EMR solids by detecting their eﬀective perme-

abilities.

I. INTRODUCTION

In 1998 and 1999 a new mesocrystal was reported [1,2] which combines both electrorhe-

ological (ER) or magnetorheological (MR) eﬀects. This sort of mesocrystal is also called

electro- and magneto-rheological (EMR) solids. In fact, ER [3] and MR [4] ﬂuids are gener-

ally particle suspensions in which the particles have large electric polarizability or magnetic

permeability. In the application of an external electric or magnetic ﬁeld, the suspended par-

ticles can form body-centered tetragonal (bct) mesocrystallities, namely ER or MR solids [5].

To one’s interest, the EMR solid shows very interesting properties when the applied electric

ﬁeld E (in z axis) is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld H (in x or y axis). In detail, in

case of dominate electric ﬁeld or dominate magnetic ﬁeld, EMR solids have thick columns

in the dominate ﬁeld direction. These columns have a bct lattice as the ideal structure,

too. Recently, a novel structural transition in EMR solids was theoretically [1] and experi-

mentally [2] observed from bct to face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice in the presence of crossed

electric and magnetic ﬁelds as the ratio between the magnetic ﬁeld and electric ﬁeld exceeds

a minimum value.

Understanding the magnetic properties of EMR solids is critical to the design of EMR-

ﬂuid-based devices. Also, these magnetic properties may provide valuable insight into the

character of the microstructure responsible for their ﬁeld-dependent rheology as well as

models of the EMR eﬀect. Since for EMR solids the uniaxial anisotropy occurs naturally,

the magnetic properties in longitudinal ﬁelds (L) should be diﬀerent from those in tranverse

ﬁelds (T). Furthermore, the structural transition can aﬀect the eﬀective magnetic properties,

and the longe-range interaction between the particles (lattice eﬀect) should be expected to

play an important role as well. Thus, prediction of the overall magnetic properties of EMR

solids is indeed a challenging task.

To calculate the eﬀective permeability of EMR solids, the existing methods for cubic

arrays of spheres [6] or for a suspension containing a dense array of particles [7] can not

be used directly. Recently, one developed a theory of homogenization to study the eﬀective

2

permeability of MR solids with a periodic microstructure [8]. In this paper, we shall present

a statistical-mechanical theory, in order to calculate the eﬀective permeability of the EMR

solids.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II, by developing the Kirkwood-Fr¨ohlich

equation and using the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation, we present a statistical-mechanical

theory for the eﬀective permeability of the EMR solids, and the numerical results are given

as well. This paper ends with a discussion and conclusion in Sec. III.

II. FORMALISM AND NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Contribution of permanent magnetic moments

For an EMR solid, its eﬀective permeability

µe is uniaxially anisotropic due to the appli-

↔

cation of external ﬁelds. In detail, the transverse component µ(T )

(in x or y axis) diﬀers from

e

the longitudinal component µ(L)

e

(in z axis). In this connection, the eﬀective permeability

↔

µe should possess a tensorial form like

Since all the permeable particles of the EMR solid have a permanent magnetic dipole moment

m, it becomes more diﬃcult to derive the expression for

↔

µe. For this purpose, Kirkwood [9]

and Fr¨ohlich [10] introduced a continuum with permeability

↔

µe0 which arises from induced

magnetization only. Based on it, we shall derive the eﬀective permeability

↔

µe of the EMR

solid consisting of permeable particles with a permanent magnetic moment m. Let us start

by seeing each particle with m to have a new tensorial moment

↔m′

,

and to be embedded in a new host (introduced continuum) of

↔

µe0, where µ2 denotes the

permeability of the nonmagnetic carrier ﬂuid, and

I a unit matrix. The denominators in

Eq. (2) and in the following equations should be interpreted as inverse matrices. In this

model each particle is replaced by a point dipole

having the same non-electrostatic

↔m′

interactions with the other point dipoles as the particles had, while the magnetizability of

the particles can be imagined to be smeared out to form a continuum with permeability

↔

µe0, which will be derived in Sec. (II B). Next, to include the anisotropic feature, we take a

characteristic spheroid of volume V , which contains n particles. In doing so, the particles in

the spheroid will be treated explicitly by taking into account the contribution of the particle

interaction to the eﬀective permeability. In principle, the approximation in this method can

be made as small as necessary by taking n suﬃciently large. Here we should remark that

for discussing isotropic cases Kirkwood [9] and Fr¨ohlich [10] used a characteristic sphere.

As a matter of fact, no matter for a sphere or a spheroid, each of them should reﬂect the

physical properties of the whole suspension. For instance, the number density inside the

sphere or spheroid should be identical to that of the whole system under consideration. In

this regard, for the present EMR solid a characteristic sphere is far from being satisfactory,

and a characteristic spheroid can be used instead so that the uniaxially anisotropic behavior

of the suspension may be considered more physically. To one’s interest, we shall show that

the explicit spheroidal shape of choice can be determined exactly, see Eq. (20) below.

permeable particles with a permanent magnetic moment. If

µe0 =

Eq. (16) reduces to the Onsager equation [12] which treats non-permeable particles with

a permanent magnetic moment embedded in vacuum. However, it is worth noting that in

the derivation of the Onsager equation only one particle is considered in the characteristic

sphere. That is, there is no more correlations between the particle orientations than can be

accounted for with the help of the continuum method, thus yielding

β =

↔

↔

I .

B. Contribution of induced magnetic moments

Now we are in a position to derive the induced-magnetization-related permeabibility

↔

µe0

by performing an Ewald-Kornfeld formulation [13,14] so that the structural transition and

long-range interaction can be taken into account explicitly. The ground state of the EMR

solid is a bct (body-centered tetragonal) lattice, which can be regarded as a tetragonal

lattice, plus a basis of two particles each of which is ﬁxed with an induced point magnetic

dipole at its center. One of the two particles is located at a corner and the other one at

the body center of the tetragonal unit cell. Its lattice constants are denoted by a3 = qℓ and

a1(= a2) = ℓq−1/2 along the z

−
anisotropic axis is directed along z axis. As q varies, the volume of the unit cell keeps

−

−

and x

(y

) axes, respectively. In this case, the uniaxial

unchanged, i.e. Vc = ℓ3. Thus, the degree of anisotropy of the tetragonal lattice is measured

by how q is deviated from unity. In particular, q = 0.87358, 1 and 21/3 represents the bct,

bcc (body-centered cubic) and fcc lattice, respectively.

7

When one applies an external magnetic ﬁeld

H0 along x axis, the induced dipole moment

↔

↔

P are perpendicular to the uniaxial anisotropic axis. Then, the local ﬁeld

Hlc at the lattice

↔

point ~R = ~0 can be determined. Let us take the transverse component as an example, and

resort to the Ewald-Kornfeld formulation [13,14] to calculate the local ﬁeld H (T )

where erfc(ηr) is the complementary error function, and η an adjustable parameter making

So far, let us deﬁne a local ﬁeld factor

C. Numerical results

Let us do some numerical simulations. Figure 1 displays µ(T )

and µ(L)

e

e

as a function of q.

For this ﬁgure, we used the Onsager consideration (i.e., assuming the characteristic spheroid

contains only one particle,

β =

I ), with a focus on the anisotropic eﬀect. As q = 1, this

↔

↔

system is in the isotropic limit, yielding µ(T )

e = µ(L)

e

. Thus, in Fig. 1 the two points at q = 1

are overlapped. It is found that the structural transition of the EMR solid (measured by the

variation of q) can cause

µe to change. To some extent, the numerical simulations show the

↔

validity of monitoring the structure of EMR solids by detecting their eﬀective permeabilities.

III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Here some comments are in order. An approximation expression for the Kirkwood cor-

relation factor

β can be obtained by taking only nearest-neighbors interactions into ac-

↔

count [17]. In this case, the characteristic spheroid may be shrunk to contain only the i-th

particle and all the nearest neighbors. It is apparent that β(L) or β(T ) will be diﬀerent from

1 when there is correlation between the orientations of neighboring particles. When the

particles tend to direct themselves with parallel permanent magnetic moments, β(L) or β(T )

will be larger than 1. When the particles prefer an ordering with anti-parallel moments, β(L)

9

or β(T ) will be smaller than 1. As the EMR solid is subjected to the external magnetic ﬁeld,

all the particles can easily direct themselves with parallel permanent magnetic moments.

In this connection, β(L) or β(T ) should be larger than 1, or could approximately equal to

1 + Nc where Nc denotes the number of the closest neighboring particles. Nevertheless,

once Nc > 0 (e.g., Nc = 8 for a bct lattice), the correlation between the nearest particles

is included approximately, and this (no ﬁgures are shown here) does not aﬀect the present

numerical result on the anisotropic eﬀect as β(L) = β(T ) = 1, i.e., Nc = 0.

The Bergman-Milton spectral representation (BMSR) [18] is an eﬀective method for cal-

culating the eﬀective dielectric constant of a two-phase composite, and has been successfully

applied in electrorheological ﬂuids [19], in order to discuss the frequency-dependent complex

dielectric constant. Alternatively, the BMSR should be expected to work for EMR solids,

and a favorable comparison between the BMSR and the Ewald summation technique used

in this work is expected.

To sum up, the aim of the present work is to develop a statistical-mechanical theory in

order to calculate the eﬀective permeability of a new mesocrystal (EMR solid). This theory

allows one to study the overall magnetic properties of EMR solids, by taking into account

the anisotropy and structural transition eﬀects and the long-range interaction between the

suspended particles. Our theory is expected to be of value in computer simulations of

magnetic/dielectric properties of EMR ﬂuids.

Abstract

The main formalisms of partial level densities (PLD) used in preequilibrium nuclear reac-
tion models, based on the equidistant spacing model (ESM), are considered. A collection of
FORTRAN77 functions for PLD calculation by using 14 formalisms for the related partial-state
densities is provided and 28 sample cases (73 versions) are described. The results are given in
graphic form too. Composite (recommended) formulas, which include the optional use of various
corrections, i.e.
the advanced pairing and shell correction in addition to the Pauli eﬀect, and
average energy-dependent single-particle level densities for the excited particles and holes, are also
given. The formalism comprises the density of particle-hole bound states, and the eﬀects of an
exact correction for the Pauli-exclusion principle are considered.

Nature of physical problem:
This Fortran code is a collection of subroutines for calculation of the partial nuclear level densities
(PLD) mainly used in preequilibrium nuclear reaction models, by using 14 formalisms for the
related partial state densities (PSD).

Method of solution:
The main approaches to the calculation of the partial state density, based on the equidistant
spacing model (ESM), are used. Composite (recommended) formulas including optionally various
corrections, i.e.
the advanced pairing and shell correction in addition to the Pauli eﬀect, and
average energy-dependent single-particle level (s.p.l.) densities for the excited particles and holes,
are also involved. The density of the particle-hole bound states is moreover comprised, and the
eﬀects of an exact correction for the Pauli-exclusion principle are considered.

Restrictions on the complexity of the problem:
Although the quantum-mechanical s.p.l. density and the continuum eﬀect can also be reproduced
by a corresponding Fermi-gas formula, to be used accordingly within the average energy-dependent
PSD in multistep reaction models, this eﬀect is not included. The calculation of PLD with linear
momentum, of ﬁrst interest for modelling preequilibrium-emission angular distributions, is not
available either.

Typical running time:
The execution time is strongly problem-dependent: it is roughly proportional to both the number
of the excitation energies and the exciton conﬁgurations considered in the calculation, while con-
sistent diﬀerences arise when various PSD formalisms are used. Twenty-eight sample cases with
73 versions which require from 0.1 to 1661 s on a PC Pentium/166MHz are provided.

Unusual features of the program:
The PSD functions have been optimized for their independent use, in order to provide tools for
PSD/PLD users (see [5]). The related drawback is the increase in execution time, while a proper
use would involve the calculation of some coeﬃcients only once in the main program. Second, the
PLD.FOR has been organized so that various formulas and versions may be tried as well as the
comparison between their predictions.

LONG WRITE-UP

1. Introduction

The particle-hole excitations caused by the nuclear reactions which proceed through a num-
ber of nucleon-nucleon interactions are described within either the semiclassical models or the
quantum-statistical theories of the preequilibrium emission (PE) [1,2] by means of the particle-
hole state densities. Basic approaches to the partial state density (PSD) consist in combinatorial
calculations performed in the space of realistic shell-model single-particle levels (s.p.l.) [3]. Lenske
et al. [4] have already used them in order to connect in a consistent way the quantum-statistical
theories of the multistep-direct (MSD) and multistep-compound (MSC) processes [5]. However,
the strong dependence on the s.p.l. basic set is the main of several shortcomings inherent in the
method (e.g., [6–9] and references therein).

∼

The equidistant spacing model (ESM) state density [10] including the eﬀect of the Pauli-
exclusion principle [11] is still widely used, as well as the phenomenological s.p.l. density value
A/14 MeV−1. Basic developments of the Williams formula [11] are due to Bˇet´ak and Dobeˇs
g
[12] including the nuclear-potential ﬁnite depth correction, Stankiewicz et al. [13] and Obloˇzinsk´y
[14] who added the bound-state condition, and Fu [15] and Kalbach [16] who included an ad-
vanced pairing correction. Additional studies along this line have involved exact Pauli-correction
calculation [17–19]. Kalbach [20–22] also discussed diﬀerent energy dependences of the s.p.l. spac-
ings and pointed out the necessity to study this subject closely related to PE surface eﬀects,
due to the interdependence of the corresponding assumptions. PSD including diﬀerent energy-
dependences of the excited-particle and hole state densities has recently been used [23] in the
geometry-dependent hybrid (GDH) model [24,25]. A similar attempt [26,27] has focused on the
MSD and MSC processes in the framework of the Feshbach-Kerman-Koonin (FKK) theory [5].
An independent semiclassical analysis [28,29] has additionally justiﬁed the surface localization of
the most important ﬁrst nucleon-nucleon interaction within PE processes, and provided average
quantities useful for the corresponding PSD calculation [30].

The various PLD formalisms based on the ESM Williams-type formula, which are still ex-
tensively used in nuclear-reaction calculations, determined the need for an appropriate subroutine
collection.
It is on the request of a project concerning a reference input-parameter library for
nuclear model calculations [31] that the present work is based. Thus, the program PLD.FOR is a
collection of algorithms developed until now and widely used for PSD/PLD calculations. The one-
and two-fermion system versions of six diﬀerent approaches and one composite (recommended)
formula including various corrections are available as FORTRAN77 functions.

The main points of the PSD and PLD formalisms are presented in Section 2. At the same
time, the sample cases (Table I) for the program PLD.FOR are described. The structure of the

3

program and the input-data description is given in Section 3. Finally, a worked example is pre-
sented in Section 4.

2. Formalism

2.1. Partial state density in the uniform spacing model

The state density of a system of p excited particles above the Fermi level and h holes below
it, considered within the uniform spacing model (based on a constant spacing d=1/g between the
non-degenerate single-particle levels) at the last occupied level in the ground state of the nucleus,
was obtained by Williams [11]

by decreasing the excitation energy E with the correction for the Pauli blocking

with respect to Ericson early formula [10] for n=p + h total number of excitons. The sum of the
partial state densities for all allowed particle-hole numbers p=h is consistent with the total nuclear
state density formula obtained in the frame of the ESM of the one-component Fermi gas [10]

is illustrated in Fig. 1(a) (the sample cases 1/1A) as proved by Williams for the generic value g=1
MeV−1 of the s.p.l. density.

Similarly, in the case of the two kinds of fermions considered, with the gπ and gν being
the single-proton and single-neutron state densities, respectively, the PSD for pπ and hπ proton
particle and hole numbers, respectively, and pν and hν neutron particle and hole numbers (n =
pπ + hπ + pν + hν) is

shown in Fig. 1(b) (Cases 2/2A) for the similar generic values gπ=gν=g/2=1 MeV−1. It results
that Eq. (8) is true within 4% for E > 3 MeV. A comparison of the PSD given by the Williams
one- and two-fermion formulas for the real case of the nucleus 93Nb is carried out in Fig. 1(c)
(Cases 3/3A) by using the phenomenological value g=A/13 MeV−1 and the derived quantities

The renormalization of the PSDs given by one-component Williams-type formula can be done by
using the ratio between the total state densities given by the two- and respectively one-component
Fermi gas formulas of the general form [33,34]

where the nuclear temperature t corresponding to the eﬀective excitation energy U (see below) is
deﬁned by [35]

Thus, the renormalized one-fermion PSD has been deﬁned by

where the renormalization factor f (U) (two-fermion system correction – TFC)

has only a weak energy dependence approximately equal to U −1/4.

Since each of the closed formulas (10) and (11) are asymptotically equal to the sum of the
one- and respectively two-component PSDs over all allowed particle-hole numbers p=h, the corre-
sponding sum of the renormalized PSD (13) is consistent with the closed formula for a two-fermion
system, as shown in Fig. 1(d) (Cases 3/3A/3B).

2.2. Bound-state and ﬁnite depth corrections

The limitation on the hole maximum energy due to the ﬁnite depth of the nuclear potential
[12] as well as on the maximum particle excitation by the nucleon binding energy B in the case of
the bound states, yielded the approximate one-fermion ESM formula [14]

function, i.e. 1 for a positive argument and 0 otherwise. The eﬀect of the nuclear-potential ﬁnite
depth on the PSD as ﬁrstly pointed out by Bˇet´ak and Dobeˇs [12], and the additional one due to
the condition of bound states, included by Obloˇzinsk´y [14], are shown in Fig. 2 (Case 4) and Fig.
3(a) (Cases 5/5A/5B). The changes obtained by releasing consecutively the ﬁnite-depth potential
and bound state conditions, by means of large F - and B-values, are shown in the later case for
the basic exciton conﬁguration 1p1h. The consequences of these conditions on the total nuclear
state density, as well as the corresponding results obtained by using the asymptotic formula (3),
are illustrated in Fig. 3(b) (Cases 6/6A/6B).

The same method [14] applied within the two-fermion ESM led to the density of partial

2.3. The advanced pairing correction

2.3.1. One-component Fermi gas formula

(a). In order to take into account the pairing interaction between nucleons a correction was
included [15] into the formula derived by Williams in the frame of the free Fermi-gas model (FGM),
function of the particle and hole numbers as well as excitation energy of the conﬁguration. The
Pauli correction was also modiﬁed to be consistent with the pairing correction, so that the PSD
formula became

ω(p, h, E, P + B) =

gn(E

p!h!(n

where B is the modiﬁed Pauli correction following the Williams term A:

and the pairing correction term

P =

g(∆2

is determined by the ground- and excited-state gaps ∆0 and ∆(p, h, E). The former is related
to the condensation energy C = g∆2
0/4. On the other hand, the constant pairing correction Up
for the total state density, based on the odd-even mass diﬀerences (e.g., [35]), may be rather well
related to the value P (ˆn) [15] where ˆn is the most probable exciton number. Since ∆=0 if n
ˆn,
it results that ∆0 can be derived from the relation Up = g∆2
0/4. Then, Fu obtained the following
parametrizations for ∆ [15,16]:

where nc = 0.792g∆0 is the critical number of excitons and Ephase is the energy of the pairing

Ephase = C [0.716 + 2.44(n/nc)2.17]

= 0

0.446
if n/nc ≥
if n/nc < 0.446 .

Actually, the lower limit in Eq. (25) was adopted [16] in order to take into account explicitly the
lack of a phase transition for small n. The original comparison of the calculated PSD with and
without pairing correction is shown in Fig. 4(a) (Case 8, with the threshold-condition released).
One should note that the respective equations provide PSD-values even below the minimum exci-
tation energies (thresholds) characteristic of each conﬁguration

Uth = C [3.23(n/nc)

1.57(n/nc)2]

= C [1 + 0.627(n/nc)2]

−

0.446
if n/nc ≤
if n/nc > 0.446 .

The correct densities, i.e. above the respective thresholds, are shown in Fig. 4(b) (Case 8).

The total state density obtained as the sum of all PSD for allowed pairs of particle-hole
numbers p = h are compared with the closed formula of the one-component Fermi gas used at an
eﬀective excitation energy decreased by the constant pairing correction Up [15]:

−

A distinct underestimation by this formula of the sum of PSD for E <8-10 MeV also results from
the comparison shown in Fig. 4(b) (Case 8) for the constant pairing correction Up=3.5 MeV. The
analysis performed with respect to the eﬀect of various Up values on this agreement [15] is shown
in Fig. 4(c) (Case 9) for the generic values g=4 MeV−1 and 0, 2, and 4 MeV for Up.

The relationship between the pairing corrections for the PSD and the ESM total state density
was extended to considering the nuclear-shell eﬀects by using an additional back-shift S of the
eﬀective excitation energy [15]

ω(p, h, E, P + B + S) =

gn(E

By analogy with the BSFG model [35] for the two-fermion system total state density

the back-shift parameter is connected to the BSFG virtual ground-state shift parameter ∆ through
the relation

∆ = Up + S

Thus, the predictions of the closed formula of the one-component Fermi gas (27) for the eﬀective
excitation energy U = E
∆, and the total state density standing for the PSDs given by Eq.
(28), should be asymptotically equal as shown by the upper curves in Fig. 4(d) (Cases 10/10A).
The lack of consistency between the sum of the one-component PSDs and the two-fermion BSFG
state density formula has been illustrated by means of the various predictions of one- and two-
component closed formulas with the same parameters for the excited odd-A nucleus 41Ca [15], also
shown in Fig. 4(d).

respectively. The comparison of the values given by the formulas of Fu [15] and Kalbach [16] above
Ethresh(p, h) for each exciton conﬁguration, respectively, is reproduced in Fig. 5(a) (Case 12).

The pairing eﬀects were also included in the total state-density formula by using an eﬀective

(35)

excitation energy decreased by the eﬀective pairing shift [16]

The sum of the PSD provided by Eq. (36) is now consistent with the Fermi-gas formula (37)
provided that the constant Up is replaced by the eﬀective-energy shift Pef f (E, C), as shown in Fig.
5(b) (Case 13).

(c). The PSD formula also within the ESM and based on an exact calculation of the Pauli
correction term [18], extended to the case of the ﬁnite well depth and bound states, and including
the Kalbach [16] pairing correction, is [19]

which follows from the approximate formula of Obloˇzinsk´y [14] if the energy-term power is ex-
panded by means of the binomial theorem. The comparison with the PSD values obtained by
means of Kalbach formula and parameters g=14 MeV−1 and ∆0=1 MeV, shown in Fig. 5(c)
(Case 17A), proves the suitability of the Pauli-correction approximation. At the same time, the
total state density given by the sum of the corresponding PSDs calculated by using the parameter
global values g=8 MeV−1 and ∆0=1 MeV [14,19] is in good agreement with the one-fermion closed
formula (42) by using the eﬀective-energy shift Pef f (E, C) [Fig. 5(d) and Case 17].

The comparison of Eq. (38) with the Obloˇzinsk´y formula can be carried out by neglecting
the pairing eﬀect, i.e. through substitution of the threshold energy Ethresh by the Pauli energy
αph. While Obloˇzinsk´y results for small exciton numbers are well represented (Case 15), a relative
deviation of about 10-40% exists between the two sets of calculated PSDs when larger 2p3h and
3p2h exciton numbers are involved [Fig. 6(a) and Case 15A]. On the other hand, the inclusion of
the pairing eﬀect [19] decreases the partial bound-state densities for small E and enhances them
for large E [Fig. 6(b) and Case 16].

2.3.2. Two-component Fermi gas formula

(a). The PSD formula derived by Williams in the frame of the two-component free Fermi-gas

model, became by inclusion of the pairing correction P2 [36]

where B2 is the simple extension of the one-fermion system correction factor for the Pauli-exclusion
principle modiﬁed by the pairing eﬀects. The pairing correction term has been adopted under the
assumption of no pairing interaction between the protons and neutrons so that

P2(E, nπ, nν) = P1(Eπ, nπ) + P1(Eν, nν) ,

and E = Eπ + Eν, nπ = pπ + hπ, and nν = pν + hν. Based on the pairing theory for two kinds
of fermions, an approximate solution was adopted for the gaps ∆π and ∆ν. Actually, by using
the mean gap-approximation, i.e. gπ=gν and ∆0π=∆0ν, it was shown that the results obtained for
the one-fermion system can be used for each of the two systems, while the pairing theory yields
that the proton system and the neutron system are excited isothermally [36]. Next, the following
simple procedure was chosen to deﬁne Eπ and Eν to approximately 10% of the exact values except
for energies near the threshold

with the overall error in P2 estimated to be about 2% except for energies near the threshold.
Moreover, similar to the one-fermion case, the pairing correction Up for the total state density is
related to P2(E, ˆnπ, ˆnν) [36]

i.e. the ground-state pairing gaps in the proton system and the neutron system are both equal to

and the respective one-fermion expressions are used except the function F (p, h) which now has
the form [16]

F (pi, hi) = 12ni/n + 4gi[Ei −

Ethresh(pi, hi)]/pim ,

where i can be either π or ν. The average excitation energies of the two kinds of nucleons have
also been assumed to be proportional to the number of degrees of freedom of each type.

Additional comments should concern Kalbach [16] energy-dependent pairing corrections for
the consistency between the total state-density closed formula of the two-component Fermi gas
at the eﬀective excitation energy decreased by the eﬀective-energy shift Pef f (E, C), and the sum
of all PSD provided by Eq. (49) for allowed pairs of particle-hole numbers pπ=hπ and pν=hν,
as shown in Fig. 7(a) (Case 13A). It was expected that the two-fermion PSDs sum should be
well approximated by the Fermi gas formula when P =Cπ+Cν, at excitation energies not too close
to threshold, under the assumption of the same gap parameters ∆0π and ∆0ν. However, the use
of the sum Pef f (E, Cπ) and Pef f (E, Cν) as well as of the constant P =Up is shown in Fig. 7(b)
(Case 13A) to be correct only for E/C
2. The PSDs sum is underestimated, i.e. the pairing
correction is overestimated at the lowest energies where the exciton conﬁgurations of only one
kind of fermions are signiﬁcant [Fig. 7(a)]. This suggests the use at these energies of only one
correction term out of the two Pef f (E, Cπ) and Pef f (E, Cν). The gradual inclusion of the second
one, by means of the sum Pef f (E, Cπ)+xPef f (E, Cν) with x between 0 and 1 for E/C varying
from 1 to 2 as also shown in Fig. 7(c), is correct just above the ﬁrst threshold. Therefore, we
found the following form was necessary to obtain the closed-formula predictions rather consistent
with the PSDs sum as in Fig. 7(b)

agreement of the related quantities is quite good but only at E/C
within the two-component Fermi-gas total state density, which is the case when the two-fermion
system correction is used, leads once again to an underestimation around the condensation energy
C. This could be the main limit of the TFC method, which reveals the need for a diﬀerent pairing
correction at energies E/C

fective pairing correction, the only constant pairing-correction Up [15], and the energy-dependent
correction Pef f , shown in Figs. 8(b) (Cases 17B/17C) and 8(c) (Cases 17A/17D). Fig. 8(d) (Cases
17A/17D) also gives the comparison with the corresponding PSD values obtained by means of the
Kalbach formula [16], which supports the correctness of the approximation for the Pauli-correction
term.

2.4. Partial state density with surface eﬀects and energy-dependent s.p.l. densities

where the Fermi energy F =38 MeV corresponds to the central nuclear well. The shallower potential
in the region of the nuclear surface, where the ﬁrst target-projectile interaction in PE reactions is
most probably localized (see also [37,29]), is taken into account by using an average eﬀective well
depth and the related Fermi energy F 1 for the hole number h

so that F 1-value is taken into account for only the initial conﬁgurations, following the assumption
of the surface localization of PE two-body interactions exciting them.

The smaller eﬀective well depth may also determine an increased signiﬁcance of another
eﬀect, namely the s.p.l. energy-dependence of g(ε). First, by taking into account this dependence,
separate excited-particle state density gp and single-hole state density gh are involved. Second, the
increase in gp has generally compensated for the decrease in gh except when the reduced potential-
well depth makes the latter much closer to the value at the Fermi energy, g0 = g(F ); since the
excited particles may well be excited above the Fermi level in PE reactions, opposite to the case
of the statistical equilibrium, the gp could increase signiﬁcantly.

The interdependence of the PE surface eﬀects and the energy dependence of the s.p.l. density
makes the functional form of the latter to be yet an open question [22]. Thus, the ﬁrst-order
eﬀects of the FGM dependence have been adopted [22,38,23] for the time being

Next, the actual basic point consists in the use of the average excitation energies ¯up = ¯εp −
excited particles, and ¯uh = F
from the ESM Eq. (57), with the result

F for
¯εh for holes [22]. The former has been estimated to ﬁrst order

while the related one for holes is

It should be underlined that the eﬀective well depth F 1 is involved in evaluating only the quantities
¯up, ¯uh and f (p, h, E, F ) while the central well depth F0 is assumed in calculating the eﬀective
s.p.l. densities. The factor gp
0 shown in Fig. 2 of Ref. [22] gives just the ratio between the

PSD including the FGM energy dependence of these eﬀective s.p.l. densities, and the ESM state
densities with only the ﬁnite-well depth correction. Both kinds of PLDs are shown in Figs. 9(a)
(Cases 18/18A) and 9(b) (Cases 18B/18C) for either the normal Fermi energy F0 or the average
eﬀective value F 1=14 MeV. The analysis concerns the exciton conﬁgurations corresponding to
the ﬁrst two-body interaction in nucleon-induced PE reactions, which are the most important for
PE-reaction calculations.

The two-component PSD formula taking into account the surface eﬀects for the initial target-

projectile interaction was given as [39]

ω(pπ, hπ, pν, hν, E) =

[gπ(p)]pπ[gπ(h)]hπ[gν(p)]pν [gν(h)]hν [E

is the simpler form of the Pauli correction for the Fermi level placed halfway between the last
occupied s.p.l. in the ground state of the nucleus and the ﬁrst vacant s.p.l. The same formalism
as in the one-fermion system case has been used for the average-excitation energies for excited
particles and holes. The only additional assumption (46) concerns the deﬁnition of the average
excitation energies Eπ and Eν, for protons and neutrons respectively.

The PLDs for the two-fermion system exciton conﬁgurations (pπ, hπ, pν, hν)=(2100), (1110),
(1100), and (1001) are also compared in Figs.
9(c) (Cases 18A/19/19A) and 9(d) (Cases
18C/20/20A) with the one-fermion PSDs of the related conﬁgurations (p, h)=(21) and (11), as well
as with the results obtained by using the method involving the two-fermion system correction. A
behavior speciﬁc of the particle-hole bound state density arises for the two-fermion-system exciton
conﬁgurations with only one hole, due to the use of Eq. (46).

2.5. Composite (recommended) PSD formulas

The completeness of a composite PSD formula can be obtained by the inclusion and optional

use of the various ESM corrections :

- extension to the case of the ﬁnite well depth and bound states [14,19,22];
- advanced pairing correction by Fu [15] and Kalbach [16] added to the Pauli correction of

Williams, proved to be still in good agreement with exact calculations [17–19];

- inclusion of the shell eﬀects together with the pairing correction [15] and use of the usual

level-density parameters also for the PSD/PLD calculation;

- energy dependence of the single-particle state densities as well as inclusion of the surface
eﬀects in the case of the ﬁrst two steps of multistep processes [22], which appear to be most
signiﬁcant for the exciton conﬁgurations mainly involved in the description of PE reactions.

Therefore, in the one-fermion system case, a composite (recommended) PSD formula is

ω(p, h, E) =

[gp(p, h)]p[gh(p, h)]hEn−1

the two-fermion systems being considered at the average excitation energies (46), respectively.
The average s.p.l. densities in Eq. (72) are evaluated within the same distinct fermion systems.
One may observe some diﬀerence between the one- and two-component formulas concerning the
calculation of the nuclear potential ﬁnite-depth correction, following the original formalisms. How-
ever, a two-fermion PSD formula quite similar to the one-component case and consistent with the
average excitation energies (46) may be obtained with minor changes.

15

The optional provision of the advanced corrections to the ESM formulas by Eqs. (67) and
(72), respectively, is illustrated in Fig. 10. Thus, no correction to the Williams formulas for either
the one-fermion system, Fig. 10(a) (Cases 21/21A), or two-fermion system, Fig. 10(b) (Cases
22/22A), determines PLD values obtained with the composite formulas which are so close or even
identical to the original ones, for the simplest conﬁgurations 1p1h. The same is true for the bound-
state case with only the ﬁnite-well depth correction, the comparison with the predictions of the
Obloˇzinsk´y formulas [14] being shown for speciﬁc conﬁgurations as well as the total state density
given by the corresponding PLDs sum. These results are given in Figs. 10(c) (Cases 23/23A)
and 10(e) (Cases 23A/24A), respectively, for the one-fermion system, and in Figs. 11(a) (Cases
23B/24B/25B) and 11(c) (Cases 23B/24B) for the two-fermion system formulas.

The speciﬁc behavior following the inclusion of the average energy-dependent formalism is
pointed out by comparison with the predictions of the Obloˇzinsk´y formulas [14] for particular
conﬁgurations and the total state density given by the PLDs sum. This is shown in Figs. 10(d)
(Cases 23/23C) and 10(f) (Cases 23C/24C), respectively, for the one-fermion system, and Figs.
11(b) (Cases 23C/24C/25B) and 11(d) (Cases 23D/24D) for the two-fermion system formulas.
The enhancement of the ”bound-state eﬀect” (i.e. reaching a PSD maximum value followed by
vanishing at a certain higher-energy limit) due to the addition of the energy-dependent s.p.l.
densities is obvious in Figs. 10(d) and 11(b). A particular feature is shown comparatively in Figs.
11(a),(b) for the one- and two-fermion system conﬁgurations with 1p1h, namely the eﬀects of the
sequential releasing of the bound-state and ﬁnite-well depth conditions.

The comparison between the predictions of the composite formula, using the FGM energy-
dependent s.p.l. densities, and the ESM formula including the advanced pairing correction [15,16]
is shown in Fig. 12(a) (Cases 26/26A). The same but for the ESM one- and two-fermion system
formulas including the exact calculation of the Pauli correction [17–19] are shown in Figs. 12(c)
(Case 28) and 12(d) (Case 28B). The corresponding bound-state PLDs are identical as long as the
average excitation energies of the two kinds of excitons are lower than the respective limits, while
next the ”bound-state eﬀect” is well increased within the average energy-dependent formalism.

Finally, the changes due to the inclusion of the surface eﬀects for exciton conﬁgurations with
one and two holes, are illustrated in the case of both fermion systems in Figs. 12(a) and Fig.
12(b) (Cases 27/27B). These changes are higher than, and increasing, the ones due to the energy-
dependent s.p.l. densities. The comparison with the original results [22] not including the pairing
correction in Fig. 12(b) points out also that taking into account the pairing eﬀects is insigniﬁcant
at higher energies but dominant in the threshold region.

2.6. The partial level density

2.6.1. One-component Fermi gas formula

The level density of p-particle–h-hole conﬁgurations of excitation energy E and nuclear spin

J, in the one-fermion formulation, is

ρ(p, h, E, J) = ω(p, h, E) R(n, E, J) ,

where the spin-distribution formula has the general expression [5]

initially introduced by Feshbach et al. [5] concern ﬁrstly the threshold existing in the former case.
Secondly, the result of Feshbach et al. is more appropriate for exciton conﬁgurations around the
most-probable exciton number ˆn, which are important to the compound-nucleus contribution; at
the same time the larger value of about 0.28nA2/3 obtained by Reﬀo and Hermann [40] is better
for the n=2 component – the PE-dominant contribution. However, σ2(E, n) can be used for all
exciton numbers since the respective values are closer to the results of Reﬀo and Hermann around
n=2, and also in good agreement with σ2

F (n)

F (ˆn).

The sum over the nuclear spins, of the PLDs given by Eq. (74), corresponds to the partial
level density ρ(p, h, E) related to the PSD of the same conﬁguration by means of the closed formula

ρ(p, h, E) =

ω(p, h, E)
(2π)1/2σ(E, n)

.

On the other hand, the sum of the PLDs over all allowed particle-hole numbers p = h should
provide the usual nuclear level density involved in the statistical model calculations of compound-
nucleus processes, which has also the one-fermion ESM formula

The comparison of the values given by the above closed formula and the sum (83) (i.e. Eqs. (52)
and (53) respectively of Ref. [32]) for the excited nucleus 41Ca is shown in Fig. 13(a) (Case 11).
The partial and total state and level densities corresponding to the two-component ESM
formulas can be obtained by using either the renormalization method [32,34] or the adjustment
method of the two-fermion formula parameters [15,32]. The former, illustrated in Fig. 4(d), oﬀers
the advantage of using only one set of e.g. BSFG model parameters for both the PLDs involved
in PE calculations and the nuclear level densities for Hauser-Feshbach calculations.

2.6.2. Two-component Fermi gas formula

The two-fermion level density formula is [36]

ρ(pπ, hπ, pν, hν, E, J) = ω(pπ, hπ, pν, hν, E, J) R(nπ, nν, E, J) ,

where the spin-distribution formula has the similar general expression [5]

R(nπ, nν, E, J) =

2J + 1
2(2π)1/2σ3(E, nπ, nν)

exp

(J + 1/2)2
−
2σ2(E, nπ, nν) #

"

,

and the spin-cutoﬀ factor σ2(E, nπ, nν) for two kinds of fermions is deﬁned as the sum of the two
one-fermion components

σ2(E, nπ, nν) = σ2(Eπ, nπ) + σ2(Eν, nν) .

The mean-gap approximation and the approximations (46) for Eπ and Eν as well as the parame-
terized function for the one-fermion system [32] are used in this respect.

The sum of the two-fermion PLDs over spins and both pπ and pν (with the restriction pπ = hπ

and pν = hν) provides the total level density

ρ2(E) =

ρ(pπ, hπ, pν, hν, E, J)

Xpπ=hπ,pν=hν XJ

which is related to the two-fermion ESM total state density by

ρ2(E) =

ω2(E)
(2π)1/2σ(E)

.

The same averages of σ2(E, n) over n as for the one-fermion formulas [32] are used for the above
spin-cutoﬀ factor

σ2(E) =

pπ=hπ,pν =hν ω(pπ, hπ, pν, hν, E) σ2(E, n)
pπ=hπ,pν=hν ω(pπ, hπ, pν, hν, E)

,

where ω(pπ, hπ, pν, hν, E) is given by Eq. (43).

The comparison of the values given by the above closed formula and the sum (88) for the
excited nucleus 41Ca is shown in Fig. 13(b) (Case 11B). Fig. 14 (Cases 11/11B) shows the compar-
ison between the average spin-cutoﬀ values σ2

[36] and σ2

rection [32,34] is given in Fig. 13(d) (Cases 11B/11E).

3. Program organization

The program PLD.FOR is the collection of the above-described algorithms developed until
now and widely used for PSD/PLD within nuclear model calculations. It also includes the rec-
ommended (combined) PLD formulas given in this work. Fourteen diﬀerent PSD formulas are
available as FORTRAN77 functions to be used as they are in various applications or codes. The
one method involved in calculating the PLD is given within a subroutine only for the tabular print-
ing of the results, while the replacement of the SUBROUTINE statement by the FUNCTION one
is immediate.

Second, the PLD.FOR has been organized so that various formulas and versions may be
tried as well as the comparison between their predictions. This could also be useful for further
development of the PSD calculation methods.

Since the ﬁrst aim of this work has been to provide tools for users of PSD/PLD, the opti-
mization of the respective procedures is made ﬁrstly in this respect. The possibility of using these
functions independently has the related drawback of increasing the execution time. A proper use,
e.g., of the PLD.FOR for PSD calculation with exact Pauli-correction term of Mao Ming De and
Guo Hua [19] would involve the calculation of the exact coeﬃcients B(p, h, λ) only once in the
main program. One should keep this aspect in mind if PLD.FOR will be used on low-speed PCs.

3.1. Subprograms

The MAIN program reads the input data which are listed and described in Table 1 in reading
order (including the names of variables which are also used below and stand for various quantities
given in the previous section). The formatted read is used for all data just to make possible the
input of only few of them, while by-default values may be involved for the rest. Then, the partial
state densities w(p, h, E) are calculated by using the speciﬁed formula, as well as eventually the
related partial level densities D(p, h, E, J). In the general case when the calculation is carried on
for all pairs of the exciton numbers p=h, it is also done for (i) the nuclear state density w(E),
as the PSD-sum over all allowed exciton numbers for which the PSD is higher than the value
WMINACC=0.1 MeV−1, or (ii) the total level density D(E) as the PLD-sum over the exciton
numbers and the nuclear angular momentum J. At the same time the corresponding values
W asym(E) or Dasym(E), respectively, are calculated by means of the ESM closed formulas, in
order to make possible a test of the overall consistency. The two-fermion system correction [34] is
involved optionally when the one-component Fermi gas formulas are used.

The subroutine PRINTIN prints the type of the PSD/PLD formula and the parameters

used in calculation.

The subroutine PRINTWN tabulates the calculated values w(p, h, E) or D(p, h, E) (the
latter being the sum over J of D(p, h, E, J), i.e. the total level density for a given exciton conﬁg-
uration), for either (i) some given particle-hole conﬁgurations, or (ii) all pairs of equal numbers of
excited particles and holes. In the latter case the values w(E) or D(E) are also printed within a
ﬁrst table including the PSD/PLDs for p=h from 1 to 7, while the corresponding closed-formula
values W asym(E) or Dasym(E) are given within the second table including the PSD/PLDs for
p=h from 8 to 16. A table of the values D(p, h, E, J), but only for the last excitation energy
E involved in one calculation, is also printed in the case of the PLD calculation for a particular

19

exciton conﬁguration.

The functions WIL1 and WIL2 calculate the partial state density w(p, h, E) for a given exci-
ton conﬁguration, by using the Williams [11] one- and two-fermion system formulas, respectively.
The functions WOB1 and WOB2 calculate the partial state density for a given particle-hole
conﬁguration by means of the Bˇet´ak-Dobeˇs one- and two-fermion system formulas, respectively
[12], with the nuclear potential ﬁnite-depth correction. The calculation of the bound-state density
according to the Obloˇzinsk´y formulas [14] is carried out if a value is speciﬁed for the nucleon
binding energy.

The functions WFU1 and WFU2 calculate the PSD for a given exciton conﬁguration by
means of the one- and two-fermion system formulas, respectively, including the advanced pairing
correction by Fu [15].

The functions WK1 and WK2 calculate the PSD for a given exciton conﬁguration by using
the improved implementation of the pairing correction by Kalbach [16] within the one- and two-
fermion system formulas, respectively.

The functions WK3 and WK4 calculate the PSD for a given exciton conﬁguration by using
the FGM energy-dependence of the single-excited particle and single-hole state densities, and/or
the ﬁnite-depth correction including the nuclear-surface eﬀects introduced by Kalbach [22] within
the one- and two-fermion system formulas, respectively.

The functions WM1 and WM2 calculate the PSD for a given exciton conﬁguration by using
the exact calculation of the Pauli-exclusion eﬀect [19] and the pairing correction by Kalbach [16]
within the one- and two-fermion system formulas, respectively.

The functions WR1 and WR2 calculate the PSD for a given exciton conﬁguration by using
the composite (recommended) formalism including optionally (i) the improved implementation of
the pairing correction by Kalbach [16], (ii) the FGM energy-dependence of the single-excited par-
ticle and single-hole state densities, and/or (iii) the ﬁnite-depth correction including the nuclear-
surface eﬀects introduced by Kalbach [22], within the one- and two-fermion system formulas,
respectively.

The function PFU calculates the advanced pairing correction by Fu [15], for the one-

component Fermi-gas.

The function FDC0 calculates

the nuclear potential ﬁnite-depth correction factor

f (p, h, E, F ) [22] for the one-component Fermi-gas.

The function FDC calculates the nuclear potential ﬁnite-depth correction factor f (p +

1, h, E, F ) [22] but for the case of bound states.

The subroutine SUBPLD calculates the partial level density D(p, h, E, J) for a given particle-
hole conﬁguration, excitation energy E and nuclear spin J, as well as the respective total level
density D(p, h, E) as their sum over J, by using the partial state density w(p, h, E) and the
formalism of Fu [32,36].

The function SIG2FU calculates the spin-cutoﬀ factor for a given excited particle-hole con-

ﬁguration [32].

The function FCTR calculates the factorial of natural numbers.

4. An illustrative test run

The sample case 23C (see also Fig. 10) is here discussed since it documents few of the speciﬁc
features of the program PLD at once. Thus, the particle-hole bound state densities for some of the
few-exciton conﬁgurations analyzed by Obloˇzinsk´y (Fig. 1 of [14]) are calculated by using both

20

the composite formula and the one of Obloˇzinsk´y. In the former case the FGM energy dependence
for the s.p.l. density is additionally taken into account, while the input data correspond to the
reference work [14]. The comparison of the results obtained with the two formulas is possible
within the same table with the columns of results given in the input-data reading order (the table
in the attached output copy below is reduced to the ﬁrst half of the involved excitation energies).
The corresponding curves are shown in Fig. 10(d). One note should concern the printed type of
the PSD formula used: it denotes only the last one when the option parameter ICONT=2 is used
and more than one formula are involved in calculation.

An additional calculation is included in this case with respect to its title. To make possible
the comparison between the PSD for a given exciton conﬁguration with equal numbers of holes
and excited particles which is calculated both speciﬁcally and within the general case for all pairs,
the latter calculation is also made. Moreover, in the attached copy of the reduced output only the
ﬁrst two tables for this calculation are shown (which would correspond to the use of the option
parameter value ICONT=-1). One may thus ﬁnd the printed values of the total state density w(E)
obtained as the PSD-sum, in the ﬁrst table, and the related W asym(E) closed-formula values, in
the second table. The corresponding curves are shown in Fig. 10(e). However, this part of the
case output consists of four tables which correspond to the maximum numbers p=h=25 for which
the PSD value at higher limit of excitation energies is yet higher than WMINACC.

Actually, the PSD/PLD values for exciton numbers higher than ˆn are usually of less interest,
while the PLD-program output includes them just for the sake of completeness. In the possible
case that an output table would include only zero values, it is omitted from print. We may add
that questions may arise for calculations for all pairs p=h when quite large excitation energies and
the two-fermion system formulas are involved, due to the limits of vectors. However, the use of
the respective FUNCTION subprograms for given exciton numbers and energy, i.e. the usual case
of nuclear reaction cross-section calculations, is always straightforward.

FIG. 1. Particle-hole state densities for the given ph conﬁgurations, and the sum of the PSD for all
allowed exciton numbers p=h (crosses), obtained with (a) the Williams’ one- and (b)-(d)
two-fermion formulas for (a) the generic value g=1 MeV−1, (b) gπ=gν=g/2=1 MeV−1, and
(c),(d) the nucleus 93Nb and the phenomenological value g=A/13 MeV−1. There are also
shown the total nuclear state-densities given by the ESM formulas for (a) the one- and (b)-
(d) two-fermion systems [10] (solid curves), compared with (c),(d) the one-fermion system
closed formula (dotted curves) and (d) the sum of the renormalized one-fermion PSDs [34]
(dashed curve).

FIG. 2. Particle-hole state densities for the 2p1h and 3p2h conﬁgurations, obtained with the ESM
one-fermion formula with (dashed and dotted curves, for various F values) and without
(solid curve) the potential ﬁnite-depth correction [12], for the value g=1 MeV−1.
FIG. 3. Particle-hole bound state densities obtained with the Williams’ one-fermion formula includ-
ing the nuclear-potential ﬁnite depth [14] for (a) the given ph conﬁgurations (solid curves),
and (a),(b) the conﬁguration 1p1h, releasing consecutively the ﬁnite-depth potential (dashed
curve) and the bound state conditions (dotted curve) by means of large F - and B-values,
(b),(c) their sum for all allowed exciton numbers p=h without/with the two corrections
(upper/lower crosses), and (c) the similar sum of the two-fermion PSDs (upper/lower x)
compared with the one- and two-fermion system closed formulas (dashed and solid curves,
respectively), for the values g=8 MeV−1, F =32 MeV, and B= 8 MeV.

FIG. 4. PSDs obtained with the Williams one-fermion formula (a) without/with the advanced pairing
correction [15] (dashed/solid curves) and (b) above the threshold energy for each conﬁgu-
ration (dotted curves), leading to the sum of the PSD for all allowed exciton numbers p=h
(solid curve), compared with the closed formula (dashed curve) for the values g=14 MeV−1
and ∆0=1 MeV, as well as (c) for g=4 MeV−1 and constant pairing correction Up of 0, 2, and
4 MeV, and (d) for the one/two-fermion system formulas (upper/lower respective curves)
and the BSFG parameters a=4.12 MeV−1 and ∆=-1.07 MeV for the excited nucleus 41Ca
[15].

FIG. 5. Comparison of the PSDs obtained with the Williams one-fermion formula, for the given
exciton conﬁgurations, and the advanced pairing correction of (a) Fu [15] (dashed curves)
and Kalbach [16] above the threshold energy for each conﬁguration (solid curves), as well
as of (c) the latter and the PSDs with exact calculation of the Pauli-principle correction
[19] (dotted curves), (b) the sum of the Kalbach PSDs (shown also below the threshold) for
all allowed exciton numbers p=h (solid curve) compared with the closed formula (dashed
curve), for the values g=14 MeV−1 and ∆0=1 MeV, and (d) the same but for the exact
formula and the value g=8 MeV−1 [19].

FIG. 6. Comparison of the particle-hole bound state densities for the given ph conﬁgurations and
the values g=8 MeV−1, F =32 MeV, and B=8 MeV, obtained with the Williams one-fermion
formula (a) including the nuclear-potential ﬁnite depth [14] (dotted curves) and the exact
calculation of the Pauli-principle correction [19] (solid curves), as well as with (b) the latter
form but without/with the advanced pairing correction and parameter value ∆0=1 MeV
(dotted/solid curves).

FIG. 7. The sum (solid curves) of (a) the two-fermion system PSDs [16] (dotted curves) for al-
lowed exciton numbers pπ=hπ and pν=hν, compared with (b) the closed formula of the
two-component ESM total state density for the excitation energy decreased by the eﬀective
pairing correction given by the term P ′
π+ν,ef f (dotted curve), and (b),(d) the term Pπ+ν,ef f
(dashed curve), (c) the constant Up (long-dashed curve), the sum Pef f (E, Cπ)+xPef f (E, Cν)
with x=1 (dashed curve) as well as between 0 and 1 for E/C varying from 1 to 2 (dotted

curve), and (d) the Kalbach term Pef f (E, C), also compared with the sum of the renormal-
ized one-fermion PSDs [34] (including the advanced pairing correction [16]) for all allowed
exciton numbers p=h (long-dashed curve), for the values g=14 MeV−1 and ∆0=1 MeV.

FIG. 8. The sum (solid curves) (a) of the two-fermion system PSDs [19] (dotted curves) for allowed
exciton numbers pπ=hπ and pν=hν, compared with the closed formula of the two-component
ESM total state density for the excitation energy decreased by the eﬀective pairing correc-
tion given by (b),(c) the Kalbach eﬀective-energy shift Pef f (E, C) (dotted curve), the term
Pπ+ν,ef f (dashed curve), and (c) the constant shift Up.
(d) The comparison of the PSD
values of Refs. [19] (dashed curves) and [16], for the given exciton conﬁgurations. The global

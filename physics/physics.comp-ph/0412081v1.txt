Backward error analysis for multisymplectic discretizations of
Hamiltonian PDEs

A.L. Islas∗ and C.M. Schober†

Abstract

Several recently developed multisymplectic schemes for Hamiltonian PDEs have been shown
to preserve associated local conservation laws and constraints very well in long time numerical
simulations. Backward error analysis for PDEs, or the method of modiﬁed equations, is a useful
technique for studying the qualitative behavior of a discretization and provides insight into the
preservation properties of the scheme. In this paper we initiate a backward error analysis for
PDE discretizations, in particular of multisymplectic box schemes for the nonlinear Schrodinger
equation. We show that the associated modiﬁed diﬀerential equations are also multisymplectic
and derive the modiﬁed conservation laws which are satisﬁed to higher order by the numerical
solution. Higher order preservation of the modiﬁed local conservation laws is veriﬁed numerically.

Introduction

When developing numerical integrators for Hamiltonian PDEs that possess a multisymplectic struc-
ture (i.e. symplectic in both space and time), it is natural to require the numerical scheme to
preserve exactly a discrete version of the multisymplectic conservation law (MSCL) [2, 8]. How-
ever, this does not imply preservation of other dynamical invariants of the system such as the local
energy and momentum conservation laws or global invariants which determine the phase space
structure. A question that immediately arises then is, to what extent are the other invariants of
the system preserved? Recent numerical experiments using multisymplectic integrators for non-
linear wave equations (e.g. the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS), sine-Gordon, and Gross-Pitaevskii
eqautions) show that the local conservations laws are preserved very well, although not exactly,
over long times [5, 6, 7]. Further, the improved preservation of the local conservation laws is re-
ﬂected in an improved preservation of complicated phase space structures [7]. This is reminiscent
of the behavior of symplectic schemes for Hamiltonian ODEs. Symplectic integrators are designed
to preserve the symplectic structure, not to preserve the energy. In fact, for general Hamiltonian
systems, conservation of the symplectic structure and conservation of energy are conﬂicting require-
ments that, in general, are not solved simultaneously by a given scheme [4]. Even so, symplectic
integrators preserve the Hamiltonian extremely well over very long times.

Backward error analysis (BEA), or the method of modiﬁed equations, is a particularly insightful
technique for studying the qualitative behavior of a discretization as well as an alternative method
for checking the accuracy of the numerical solution [12]. Since our main interest lies in the geometry
preserving properties of multisymplectic schemes, the main question backward error analysis tries
to answer (whether the distinguishing properties of the original equation carry over to the modiﬁed
equation which the numerical solution satisﬁes to higher order) becomes relevant to our study. For

a given scheme, the derivation of the associated modiﬁed equation is related to the calculation of
the local truncation error and has, typically, been used to examine the dispersive, dissipative and
diﬀusive properties of PDE discretizations. For example, in the numerical analysis of linear PDEs
a backward error analysis of the Lax-Friedrichs method or the upwind method for the advection
equation produces in both cases a modiﬁed equation that is an advection-diﬀusion equation. This
helps one to understand the qualitative behavior of the methods and, from this perspective, explains
why the numerical solution in both cases becomes smeared out as time evolves.

Likewise, BEA is an important tool in the study of geometric integrators [3, 4, 10, 9]. For
Hamiltonian ODEs, symplectic methods lead to modiﬁed equations which are also Hamiltonian. In
fact, the modiﬁed equation of a Hamiltonian ODE is also Hamiltonian if and only if the integrator
is symplectic; this is then used to rigorously establish that a symplectic integrator almost preserves
the total energy over an exponentially long period of time [4]. In striking contrast, nonsymplectic
methods used to integrate Hamiltonian ODEs can introduce dissipation, a feature which is readily
predicted by the dissipative form of the modiﬁed equations. Less has been established using BEA
for Hamiltonian PDEs since there are a variety of ways to implement a BEA and the relevance of
the analysis is open to interpretation. Spatial discretization of a PDE results in a system of ODES
to which a standard BEA can be applied to derive a modiﬁed equation that is satisﬁed to higher
order in one independent variable. Alternatively, a BEA can be used to derive modiﬁed equations
for the PDE that are satisﬁed to higher order in both space and time [10, 9].

In this paper we implement a formal backward error analysis in both space and time of two
multisymplectic box schemes, the Euler and the centered cell box schemes, as applied to the non-
linear Schrodinger equation. We ﬁnd that the modiﬁed equations of these box schemes are also
multisymplectic. The modiﬁed PDEs are used to derive modiﬁed conservation laws of energy and
momentum that are approximated by the MS scheme to higher order in space and time. For the
centered cell discretization of the NLS we numerically verify that the modiﬁed conservation laws
are satisﬁed to higher order by the numerical solution. This provides a partial explanation of the
superior resolution of the local conservation laws and global invariants by MS schemes (e.g. see the
numerical experiments in section 5) and a deeper understanding of the local and global properties
of MS integrators.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we recall the multisymplectic formulation
of Hamiltonian PDEs and of the NLS equation. In section 3 we introduce the box schemes, establish
multisymplecticity, and apply them to the NLS equation. We present a straightforward method
for obtaining compact box schemes that is applicable to many multisymplectic PDEs. Section 4
contains the backward error analysis of the discretizations.
In section 5 numerical experiments
for the MS centered cell box scheme are discussed, illustrating the remarkable behavior of MS
schemes. Higher order preservation of the modiﬁed local conservation laws is veriﬁed numerically,
which supports the use of MS integrators in long time numerical simulations of Hamiltonian PDEs.

2 Multisymplectic Hamiltonian PDEs

A Hamiltonian PDE (in the “1+1” case) is said to be multisymplectic if it can be written as

Mzt + Kzx = ∇zS,

IRn,

z

∈

where M, K
state variable z(x, t) [11, 2]. The variational equation associated with (1) is given by

IRn×n are skew-symmetric matrices and S : IRn

IR is a smooth function of the

(1)

The Hamiltonian system (1) is multisymplectic in the sense that associated with M and K are the
2-forms

ω =

κ =

(dz

which deﬁne a symplectic space-time structure (symplectic with respect to more than one indepen-
dent variable).

Any system of the form (1) satisﬁes conservation of symplecticity. Let dz be any solution of
the variational equation (2). Then it can be shown that ω and κ, as deﬁned in (3), satisfy the
multisymplectic conservation law (MSCL):

∂ω
∂t

∂κ

= 0.

This result is obtained by noting that

since M, K are skew-symmetric and Szz is symmetric. The MSCL (4) is a local property and
expresses the fact that symplecticity for Hamiltonian PDEs can vary locally over the spatial domain.
An important consequence of the MS structure is that when the Hamiltonian S(z) is independent

of t and x, the PDE has local energy and momentum conservation laws [11, 2]

It + Gx = 0,

The focusing one dimensional nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation,

can be written in multisymplectic form by letting u = p + iq and introducing the new variables

3 Multisymplectic box schemes

Multisymplectic discretizations are numerical schemes for approximating (1) which preserve a dis-
crete version of the multisymplectic conservation law (4). That is, if the discretization of the
multisymplectic PDE and its conservation law are written schematically as

and

where f j

∂x, then the numerical scheme (12) is said to be multisymplectic if (13) is a discrete conservation
law of (12) [11, 2].

and ∂i,j

A standard method for constructing multisymplectic schemes is to apply a known symplectic

discretization to each independent variable. For example, splitting the matrices M and K as

M = M+ + M− and K = K+ + K− with MT

3.1 Multisymplectic box schemes for the NLS equation

The multisymplectic centered cell box scheme was ﬁrst developed for the NLS equation in [5]
where an apparently ad hoc reduction provided a particularly compact form of the scheme. This
reduction turns out to be generalizable as can be seen in McLachlan’s derivation of box schemes for
the Korteweg de Vries equation [1]. Here we present a general approach for constructing compact
box schemes which is applicable to many multisymplectic PDEs.

5 Numerical Results

For our numerical experiments we consider the NLS equation with periodic boundary conditions,
u(x + L, t) = u(x, t). We use initial data for a multi-phase quasi-periodic (in time) solution, i.e.,
u0(x) = 0.5(1 + 0.1 cos µx), µ = 2π/L, L = 2√2π. This initial data corresponds to a multi-phase
solution, near the plane wave, characterized by one excited mode. We examine the performance of
the centered cell box scheme (which we designate as MS-CC) for varying mesh sizes and time steps.
The solution to equation (24) is found by writing it in matrix form A−u1 = A+u0 + F (u1, u0) and
using an iteration technique to solve for u1.
The solution with N = 64 and dt = 5

10−3 for 450 < t < 500 is shown in Figure 1a. The
surface clearly exhibits the correct quasiperiodic behavior in time. In addition, we are interested
in how well the local and global conservation laws are satisﬁed. To evaluate the local conservation
laws, we use midpoint discretizations of the form

10−3, T = 500: a) surface, b-c) error in the

In general, these residuals are not zero (Figures 1b-c). The errors in the local conservation laws,
the LECL and LMCL (9)-(10), are 10−6 and 10−3, respectively, and are concentrated around the
regions where there are steep gradients in the solution. If S(z) were a quadratic functional of z,
S(z) = 1
2 zT Az, with A a symmetric matrix, then the local conservation laws would be conserved
exactly [2]. In general, as in the present case, the PDE is nonlinear and S(z) is not a quadratic
functional. Therefore, the local energy and momentum conservation laws will not be preserved
exactly. However the numerical experiments show that the local conservation laws are preserved
very well over long times. In addition to resolving the LECL and LMCL very well, the MS scheme
preserves the global errors extremely well. The error in the global energy oscillates in a bounded
fashion, as expected of a symplectic integrator (Figure 1d) while the error in the global momentum
(Figure 1e) and the norm (not shown) are conserved exactly (up to the error criterion of 10−14 in
the solver) since they are quadratic invariants.

The maximum error in the LECL and LMCL and in the global energy and momentum for the
MS scheme are provided in Table 1 for varying mesh sizes and time steps. The error in the LECL
depends only on the timestep t and is second order, while the error in the LMCL depends only on
the spatial mesh size N and is second order.

and momentum obtained using the MS scheme MS, with T = 500.

We next examine whether the modiﬁed local conservation laws obtained using the MS-CC
discretization of the NLS are preserved to a higher order than the original local conservation laws.
Since our solution is quasiperiodic, we compute the solution for 0 < t < T , where T is chosen to
include a characteristic cycle. From Figure 1, T = 10 is suﬃcient. Since the ECL is independent
of ∆x (see Table 1), for a ﬁxed N , we let ∆t
0. That is, start with ∆t0 = ∆x and let
∆t = ∆t0/2k, k = 0, 1, ..., 6.

→

We compute the LECL and the modiﬁed LECL at each time step using centered approximations
of the derivatives of suﬃciently high order so as not to aﬀect the order of the MS-CC discretization
of the residuals. Figure (2) shows the loglog plot of the maximum error as a function of the timestep
for the LECL and the modiﬁed LECL. Clearly we can see that while the LECL is satisﬁed to 2nd

as a function of the mesh size is similar.

We consider the classical evolution of a lattice of non-linear coupled oscillators for a special case
of initial conditions resembling the equilibrium state of a macroscopic thermal system at the critical
point. The displacements of the oscillators deﬁne initially a fractal measure on the lattice associated
with the scaling properties of the order parameter ﬂuctuations in the corresponding critical system.
Assuming a sudden symmetry breaking (quench), leading to a change in the equilibrium position of
each oscillator, we investigate in some detail the deformation of the initial fractal geometry as time
evolves. In particular we show that traces of the critical fractal measure can sustain for large times
and we extract the properties of the chain which determine the associated time-scales. Our analysis
applies generally to critical systems for which, after a slow developing phase where equilibrium
conditions are justiﬁed, a rapid evolution, induced by a sudden symmetry breaking, emerges in time
scales much shorter than the corresponding relaxation or observation time.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Chains of non-linear coupled oscillators are of fundamental nature: they provide a laboratory to explore the setup
of thermodynamical properties through the microscopic dynamics in complex systems [1, 2, 3]. In addition, being the
discrete version of ﬁeld theories, they naturally emerge in any numerical study of the non-linear dynamics as well as
statistical mechanics of classical ﬁelds [4]. One of the most important questions in the later case is to determine the
conditions which can drive the evolving system towards a thermalized stationary state. In the early days Fermi, Pasta
and Ulam [5] have obtained deviations, even for large times, from the naively expected equipartition of the energy
among the diﬀerent oscillators. Through the eﬀorts to explain these results, it became clear that, for appropriate
initial conditions, a variety of stable periodic solutions (breathers, solitary waves) [6], deﬁned on the non-linear chain,
exists. Therefore, the choice of the ensemble of the initial conﬁgurations strongly inﬂuences the long time behavior of
the system dynamics. Recent works [3, 4] show that for a random ensemble of initial conﬁgurations a suﬃciently large
system relaxes to the usual equilibrium distribution, but the corresponding relaxation time strongly depends on the
parameters of the theory. These studies include the case when a chain of oscillators is replaced by a multi-dimensional
(2 − D or 3 − D) lattice [4]. In fact, when considering non-linear lattices in more than one dimensions, the thermalized
equilibrium state can posses critical properties. The question of how critical properties can dynamically occur in a
system of coupled oscillators is not yet fully understood. Some recent investigations [2] indicate that changes in the
topological properties of the phase space of the considered system are induced by ﬁne tuning the mean kinetic energy
of the oscillators. The critical state, when formed, is associated with appropriately deﬁned fractal measures on the
non-linear lattice. In the present work we investigate the scenario when such a critical state has already been formed
and a sudden symmetry breaking drives the system apart from critical behavior. Furthermore, it is assumed that
the time scale of the symmetry breaking process is much smaller than the relaxation time of the oscillator dynamics.
In order to implement this scenario we will use the critical state as initial condition posed on the oscillators in the
lattice. The corresponding fractal measure is generated through a suitable excitation of the oscillators. Contrary to
the existing analysis of correlations and their evolution in a fractal lattice [7], our approach is closer to the conditions
expected to occur in a real critical system where inhomogeneities in the order parameter density have a fractal proﬁle
embedded in a conventional space. The evolution of initial fractal measures has been studied both classically, in the
context of reaction-diﬀusion models [8], as well as quantum-mechanically [9]. In the classical case an unconventional
decay of correlations was observed, while in the quantum one the initial fractal dimension turns out to be a conserved
quantity.

We investigate ﬁrst the 1−D case of a nonlinear chain and then extend our treatment to lattices in higher dimensions.
The 1−D example, although it cannot be directly related to a critical system in the absence of long ranged interactions,
due to the no-go theorem of Peierls [10], it helps for the simpler illustration of the basic dynamical mechanisms which
dominate the evolution of the system in the meta-critical phase. The extension to 2 − D is straightforward using
the insight gained by the 1 − D model. The main ﬁnding of our analysis is a set of conditions which control both

qualitatively and quantitatively the time-scale for which traces of the initial critical state, characterized by the fractal
mass dimension, sustain. In addition we show that this is a new time-scale not directly associated with the relaxation
time towards the false vacuum.

The paper is organized as follows:

in section II we describe the dynamical model used in our analysis and we
explain the algorithm used to generate the initial conditions. In section III we give the numerical solution of the
equations of motion for the 1 − D case as well as the observables which are relevant in quantifying the eﬀect of the
sudden symmetry breaking. To facilitate our analysis we ﬁrst consider in subsection IIIa the harmonic chain, and in
subsection IIIb we include non-linear chain interactions. In section IV we extend our study to 2 − D, discussing also
the higher dimensional case. Finally in section V we present brieﬂy our concluding remarks.

II. GENERATING A FRACTAL MEASURE IN A CHAIN OF NON-LINEAR OSCILLATORS

The considered dynamical system consists of a set of coupled oscillators located on an equidistant lattice. These
oscillators are the discretized version of a self-interacting scalar ﬁeld. In a simpliﬁed approach we investigate ﬁrst the
1 − D case when the oscillators are arranged in a closed chain. The Lagrangian of this system is taken as:

where α is the lattice spacing and V (σi) is the self-interaction term. We study the dynamics implied by eq. (1)
using appropriate initial conditions {σi(0), ˙σi(0)} in order to deﬁne a fractal measure on the 1 − D lattice [15]. The
construction of these conﬁgurations is based on a ﬁnite approximation to the 1 − D Cantor dust with prescribed
Hausdorf fractal dimension Df [11, 12]. Although the construction algorithm for such a set is described in several
textbooks on fractal geometry we also present it here brieﬂy in order to be self-contained. The ﬁrst step in the
algorithm is the partition of the ﬁnite real interval [0, 1] into three successive subintervals of sizes ℓ1, ℓ2 and ℓ3, in
ratios ℓ1
2 ), covering the entire set [0, 1]. The middle subinterval is called
ℓ2
trema where the two others are called precurds [11]. At each step of the algorithm the trema is omitted, while the
precurds are divided also in three subintervals with sizes fulﬁlling the same ratios as above. At the k-th stage of the
algorithm there are 2k precurds and 2k − 1 tremas. In the limit k → ∞ we obtain a Cantor dust with fractal dimension

A ﬁnite approximation to the Cantor dust with dimension Df can be obtained using the centers of the precurds

the obtained equidistant lattice (N ≈ 2 × 104) is much larger than that in the generating Cantor set (211). The inset
is presented to illustrate the self-similarity of the set more transparently.

The constructed set of oscillators (σ-ﬁeld) possesses the property (5), as can be seen in the log-log plot of m(ζ)
versus ζ presented in ﬁg. 2. The exponent Df , i.e the fractal mass dimension, is equal to 5/6 within an error of less
than 1%.

There are a few comments to be added concerning the connection of the constructed oscillator chain with critical
phenomena.
In fact the equilibrium position of the oscillators can be identiﬁed with the order parameter of an
equivalent critical system, while the displacements σν are associated with the ﬂuctuations of the order parameter.
Clearly, at the critical point the expected ﬂuctuation pattern possesses fractal characteristics in close analogy to the
measure (5) deﬁned on the considered oscillator chain.

III. FRACTAL MEASURE DEFORMATION IN THE 1 − D CASE

In the previous section we determined the values of the scalar σ-ﬁeld on the N lattice sites, in order to present
fractal characteristics. That is, from the total of N oscillators we have displaced 2k of them to the value ±1 while
keeping the rest to zero, in such a way that eq. (5) holds and the system possesses a fractal mass dimension Df .
We are interested in studying the evolution of this σ-conﬁguration according to the dynamics determined by the
Lagrangian (1), and especially we focus on the evolution of m(ζ). Before considering an anharmonic, in general,
potential (for example of fourth order), it is interesting to investigate the simple harmonic case where there is some
analytic information, in order to acquire a better apprehension. However, even this simple model will reveal a rich
and unexpected behavior.

We consider ﬁrst the second order potential

where λ and A are the coupling parameters of our model. All the quantities (σ, λ, A, as well as the space-time

where α is the lattice spacing and dt is the time step. The upper indices indicate the time instants and the lower indices
the lattice sites. As usual we perform an initial fourth order Runge-Kutta step to make our algorithm self-starting,
and we impose periodic boundary conditions.

Let us ﬁrst assume zero initial kinetic energy, i.e ˙σi = 0 for every lattice site, which physically is a strong requirement
of equilibrium. We evolve the constructed fractal conﬁguration, obtained using k = 11, according to (7) for various
potential parameters. In ﬁg. 3 we depict m(ζ) versus ζ for three successive times, t = 0, t = 5 and t = 9, for λ = 1
and A = 1. Initially the slope ψ is the fractal mass dimension Df . Here we have chosen Df = 5/6. As we can see,
the initial fractal geometry is completely lost at t = 5. However, at t = 9 it is almost re-established.

Let us explore this remarkable result further. In the upper graphs of ﬁg. 4 we present the evolution of the mean
ﬁeld value hσ(t)i for three λ and A cases. In the lower ones we show the corresponding evolution of the slope ψ(t) of
m(ζ) versus ζ (each ψ(t) value obtained through a linear ﬁt). First of all, the spatial mean ﬁeld value hσ(t)i oscillates
around the potential minimum σmin = 1 + 2A
λ with constant amplitude as expected. Secondly, one oscillator moving

, and this holds amazing well for hσ(t)i too, due to the synchronization

We observe that the exponent ψ(t) rapidly reaches the embedding dimension value 1, but it reacquires a value
close to the initial one periodically.
It is easy to see that this (partial but clear) re-establishment of the initial
fractal geometry happens at times where hσ(t)i returns to its starting point, which is the lower turning point of the
oscillations. In the case we are looking at, this starting point corresponds to hσ(0)i ≈ 0 (since only a small fraction
of sites is displaced to ±1 while the others form a zero background) and to ˙σi(0) = 0 for every oscillator. Therefore,
Indeed, initially only the discrete set of oscillators displaced

to ±1 contributes to the integral (5), while the zero background adds with zero eﬀect. As the system of coupled
oscillators evolves in the potential (6), this zero background is excited and its non-zero but trivial contribution to (5)
suﬃciently overcomes that of the initial ±1’s and consequently deforms completely the fractal geometry. However,
we expect a simultaneous return of this background to zero (synchronization) since the energy transfer between
the diﬀerent oscillators takes place through the spatial derivative (which is small since the displacement to ±1 is
not large compared to the potential minimum) and therefore only the zeros close to the initial ±1’s will return to
a diﬀerent value. Moreover, this behavior is ampliﬁed by the initial zero kinetic energy for all oscillators, which
strengthens homogeneity. As a result, at times where hσ(t)i and the zero background return to the lower turning
point, the system re-exhibits a power law behavior in m(ζ) with exponent close to the initial one, i.e to the fractal
mass dimension Df = 5/6. Each re-appearance of the initial fractal geometry will survive as long as the system
stays close to its lower turning point, therefore the corresponding interval will be larger for smoother potentials at
their minimum. This eﬀect can be weakly seen comparing the lower left and right plots of ﬁg. 4. Lastly, due to the
non-trivial excitation of the zeros in the neighborhood of the initial ±1’s, which number increases monotonically as
time passes, every partial re-establishment of the initial fractal geometry will possess slightly larger exponent than the
previous one. This behavior is observed in ﬁg. 4, where the ψ(t) value at the minima increases successively. Therefore,
we expect that the dynamics will totally deform the original fractality in the end.

FIG. 5: △E(t) for λ = 10 and A = 1. The minima coincide with those of hσ(t)i and ψ(t).

A supporting argument for the cogitation analyzed above is the calculation of △E(t) =

[Ei(t) − Ei(0)]2,
which provides a measure for the divergence of the oscillators’ total energies from their initial values. In ﬁg. 5 we plot
△E(t) for λ = 10 and A = 1 case. As we observe, it presents minima for the same times as hσ(t)i and ψ(t), therefore
the partial re-appearance of the fractal geometry happens when the oscillators acquire energies close to their initial
ones. However, △E(t) cannot describe the mixing of energy between the diﬀerent oscillators.

There are two time scales in the reappearance phenomenon. The ﬁrst, naming τ1, is the period of the partial
re-establishment of the initial fractal mass dimension. It coincides with the oscillations period as we have already
mentioned. The second, τ2, is the time scale which determines the complete deformation of the initial fractal geometry.
We quantify an estimation of τ2 by assuming that the diﬀerence of ψ(t) at two successive minima is constant. If ψl
denote these successive minima and tl = lτ1 the corresponding successive times, this natural assumption reads:

This ﬁnite diﬀerence equation has the solution:

ψl+2 − ψl+1
ψl+1 − ψl

= C.

ψl = 1 − (1 − ψ(0)) e−

qtl ,

qτ1, where we have added the necessary terms in order to get correct values for l = 0 (ψ(0)) and for l → ∞
if C = e−
(ψ(tl) → 1). Therefore, we determine τ2 in terms of the exponent q: τ2 ≈ 5/q. The approximation (8) reproduces
very well the exact ψl behavior, as can be observed in ﬁg. 4 where we display, with the dashed line, the analytical
estimation (9) for q = 0.013. Indeed, q oﬀers a measure of the deformation of the initial fractal geometry, and in the
following we investigate numerically its dependence on the various model parameters.

Firstly, q, i.e τ2, is completely independent from λ and A, contrary to τ1 which (coinciding with the oscillation
period) depends on λ. The constant value of q for diﬀerent A and λ, is a result of the increase of the oscillation
frequency combined with a compensating decrease of the diﬀerence ψl+1 − ψl. The corresponding q − λ and q − A
plots are trivial horizontal lines.

On the left plot of ﬁg. 6 we depict the dependence of q on the total number of lattice sites N , for λ = 1 and
A = 1. Note that increasing k in the construction of the Cantor 2k-point set, we result to a much more rapidly
growing equidistant lattice (the points in ﬁg. 6 correspond to a successive increase of k from 7 to 13). It is clear that q
decreases exponentially with N , therefore the deformation becomes weaker. The explanation is straightforward since
by increasing the number of the Cantor points (which will form the ±1’s in the equidistant lattice) we need much
more sites with zero value. In other words, the measure of the ±1’s relatively to the zero background decreases with
N . Due to the inﬂuence of this background to the re-appearance phenomenon (larger times needed for the mixing
of the oscillators through the spatial derivative) the deformation becomes weaker with N , i.e q decreases. Finally, it
is obvious that in an inﬁnite system the initial fractal geometry will be periodically deformed and re-established for
inﬁnite time (q → 0, i.e τ2 → ∞ for N → ∞), since in this case the initial measure of the ±1’s is zero and therefore
inﬁnite time is needed for the mixing and de-synchronization of the zero background.

On the right graph of ﬁg. 6 we show the dependence of q on the initial variation of σ-ﬁeld, calculated by (δσ)2 =
i σi/N )2 at t = 0, for the diﬀerent N values used in the left plot. The initial variation of
hσ2i − hσi2 =
the σ-ﬁeld, reﬂecting the domination of the homogenous zero background, aﬀects the deformation exponent q. Larger
initial (δσ)2 values correspond to zero background with smaller measure relatively to the ±1’s, and therefore to weaker
re-appearances, i.e to larger q’s. On the other hand, for N → ∞ (δσ)2 → 0, the measure of the ±1’s becomes zero,
and the re-appearance phenomenon holds for ever (q → 0, i.e τ2 → ∞).

Another possibility could be to change the initial (δσ)2 by displacing randomly all the oscillators from their con-
structed values, while keeping N constant. However, we avoid doing so since this procedure alters the initial fractal
mass dimension.
Instead, we may perturb randomly the initial time derivatives and investigate the eﬀect of the
variation of the initial kinetic energies on q. In ﬁg. 7 we present the dependence of q on the variation of ˙σi at t = 0,
i ˙σi/N )2, for N = 18819 (211 Cantor points), in the λ = 1, A = 1
given by (δ ˙σ)2 = h ˙σ2i − h ˙σi2 =
case. Indeed we observe a signiﬁcant increase of q for larger (δ ˙σ)2 as expected, due to the de-synchronization of the
zero background, i.e the initially zero oscillators are excited and mixed due to their diﬀerent kinetic energies too,
apart from their coupling to the ±1’s. Mind that the turning point is not zero any more and hσ(t)i moves to negative
values, too. Finally, note that additionally to this ˙σ(0) perturbation, there is always a constant initial (δσ)2 present,
resulting from the ±1’s ((δσ)2 ≈ 0.1 in this speciﬁc case), which cannot be removed. Therefore, the stabilization of q
for suﬃciently small (δ ˙σ)2 is due to the overcoming eﬀect of (δσ)2 comparing to that of (δ ˙σ)2.

Finally, a quantitative measure concerning the aforementioned dynamics is the Lyapunov exponent. Following [2] we
can calculate it analytically in this simple second order potential case. The constant, for every oscillator, curvature
leads to Lyapunov exponent exactly equal to zero, which according to our analysis can be related to limN
q.
However, a proof of this statement goes beyond the scope of the present work.

second order case of ﬁg. 4, the oscillation amplitude decreases with time due to the anharmonic dynamics. However,
the amplitude attenuation weakens with increasing lattice size N and for an inﬁnite system it remains constant.

hσ(t)i has a minimum, holds similarly to the harmonic case. Firstly, the anharmonicity of the potential occasionally

leads to ψ(t) greater than one. Secondly, time scale τ1, which determines the period of the re-appearance phenomenon,
coincides with the oscillation period T . It cannot be calculated analytically and in ﬁg. 10 we depict its dependence
on λ and A found numerically. Thirdly, computation of △E(t) leads to similar to the second order case results, that
is it possesses minima simultaneously with hσ(t)i and ψ(t).

Continuing we study the dependence of the exponent q of eq. (9), which quantiﬁes the gradual permanent de-
formation of the initial fractal geometry, on the various parameters. Note however that in general in this fourth
order potential case the upper envelope of the ψ(t) graph is more complex. In ﬁg. 11 we present q versus lattice
site number N (left plot), and versus the corresponding initial variation (δσ)2 (right plot). Its behavior is similar
to the second order case of ﬁg. 6 and the interpretation is the same. However, the corresponding q values seem to
be slightly increased, that is the anharmonic dynamics deforms the initial fractal geometry earlier. The explanation
of this behavior is the decreasing oscillations amplitude of this case (see ﬁg. 9). Indeed, the system lower turning
point moves gradually to larger values, i.e hσ(t)i does not return to zero and the initially zero background remains
excited, thus spoiling the fractal mass dimension. The permanent oscillators displacement from zero is an additional
mechanism of the fractality deformation in a ﬁnite system, apart from the mixing and de-synchronization caused by
the partial derivative. Its eﬀect weakens with increasing N , since the amplitude attenuation weakens too, as we have
already mentioned.

The ampliﬁed deformation rate can be deduced also from ﬁg. 12, where we depict the dependence of q on the
initial variation of ˙σi. It resembles the corresponding ﬁg. 7 of the harmonic case but now q is signiﬁcantly larger,
especially for large (δ ˙σ)2. Therefore, the increased initial kinetic energy interferes intensely with the complex fourth
order dynamics, leading to a deformation of the initial fractality at signiﬁcantly smaller times.

The main diﬀerence between fourth and second order cases, is the eﬀect of λ and A on q. Contrary to the previous
harmonic potential, where q − λ and q − A plots are trivial horizontal lines, in ﬁg. 13 we show these graphs for the

case in hand. We elicit that q increases almost algebraically with λ while it decreases with A in a more complex way.
Although variation of λ seems to be slightly more important than that of A, both have less inﬂuence on q than N
and ˙σi.

A possible explanation of this dependence of q on λ and A, could be the corresponding Lyapunov exponent. For
the fourth order potential this exponent cannot be calculated analytically. We estimate it semi-analytically following
[2], and we ﬁnd that for ﬁnite N it is not zero anymore, but it takes a small non-zero value depending on the potential
parameters, especially on its curvature, i.e on λ. However, even in this anharmonic case, the Lyapunov exponent
seems to tend to zero for larger N , therefore an inﬁnite system will posses the re-appearance phenomenon for inﬁnite
time (q → 0, i.e τ2 → ∞ for N → ∞), consistently with ﬁg. 11.

IV. TWO AND HIGHER DIMENSIONAL EVOLUTION

It is necessary to investigate the validity of the allegation described above in higher dimensional systems, where
critical behavior can naturally arise. Keeping as a central observable of interest for the critical system the fractal
geometry of the clusters formed at the critical point, it is possible to model, in a simpliﬁed manner, the critical system
with an ordinary geometrical set possessing the appropriate fractal mass dimension. In fact we can construct a set
with dimension Df embedded in a D-dimensional space, by taking the Cartesian product of 1 − D sets, generated
by the procedure described in section II, each one having fractal mass dimension Df /D [13]. For simplicity we
consider here the 2 − D case, leading to a N1 × N2 lattice where the ﬁeld values are the products of the corresponding
one-dimensional ones, thus resulting to 2k1 × 2k2 ±1’s. As a concrete example, following the steps of section II we
produce a 1551 × 1551 lattice arising from the Cartesian product of two 28 Cantor sets, each one possessing fractal
mass dimension 5/6. The set of lattice sites with non-vanishing ﬁeld values is a ﬁnite realization of a fractal set with
dimension 5/3 embedded in a two dimensional space.

FIG. 14: hσ(t)i and ψ(t) evolution for λ = 1 and A = 1, for the second order potential (left plots), and for the fourth order
one (right plots). The dashed line in the lower graphs marks the F (t) = 2 − (2 − ψ(0))e−qt curve, with q = 0.14 and q = 0.13
respectively.

It is straightforward to generalize the equations of motion (7), (11), for the second and fourth order potential cases
respectively. Initial equilibrium corresponds to ﬁeld conﬁguration with zero kinetic energy, similarly to the 1 − D
analysis. The evolution of the system is depicted in ﬁg. 14 for λ = 1 and A = 1. We show the mean displacement
hσ(t)i (averaged over the lattice), as well as the running mass dimension ψ(t). We observe the same phenomenon of
the partial re-establishment of the initial fractal geometry every time hσ(t)i approaches its lower turning point. The
time scale τ1 of the re-appearance period coincides with that of the oscillations, and the envelope of the minima of
ψ(t) has an exponential form with exponent q similarly to the 1 − D case, suggesting that the analysis of the previous
section is also valid in this case. It is clearly seen in ﬁg. 14 that ψ(0) equals 5/3, and ψ(t) reaches successively the
embedding dimension value 2 as expected. However the exponent q is almost one order of magnitude larger, leading
to the conclusion that the higher dimensional dynamics deforms the initial fractal geometry earlier.

The same procedure can be easily extended to three dimensions. However since the lattice site number increases
rapidly with increasing dimension we have to use a very coarse-grained approximation of the initial Cantor set in
order to acquire plausible computational evolution times.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In the present work we have investigated the evolution of a fractal set resembling the order parameter clusters
formed at the critical point of a macroscopic system. Our analysis is based on a simpliﬁed description of the critical
system, restricted to the reproduction of the correct fractal mass dimension. We assumed initial equilibrium and
we explored the variation of this appropriately deﬁned fractal mass dimension with time. We have found that the
initial fractal geometry is being deformed and partially re-established periodically, at times when the mean ﬁeld value

13

returns to its lower turning point. The origin of this eﬀect is made more transparent in a harmonic 1 − D model. For a
complete study we investigated the inﬂuence of anharmonic interactions as well as initial deviations form equilibrium,
on the time scales determining the re-appearance phenomenon. We derive an analytical expression describing, to a
suﬃcient accuracy, the value of the running fractal mass dimension ψ(t) at the re-appearance times, and we show that
the re-appearance frequency coincides with the oscillations one. The total duration of the re-establishment process is
inversely proportional to a characteristic exponent q, which depends on various parameters of the model. In particular
q is a decreasing function of the total lattice size N , the initial ﬁeld variation (δσ)2 and the initial time derivative
variation (δ ˙σ)2. Therefore in an inﬁnite system the initial fractal mass dimension re-appears for ever. The only
qualitative diﬀerence of the harmonic and anharmonic analysis is the q dependence on the potential parameters λ and
A in the fourth order case.

The same treatment can be followed in higher dimensional (D ≥ 2) systems, too.

In these more relevant,
for the simulation of real critical systems, cases, we observe a similar behavior which can be explained in an
analogous manner. The only quantitative diﬀerence is that q increases signiﬁcantly with D. Therefore, the
partial re-appearance of the initial fractal geometry seems to be a robust mechanism of the evolution of critical
systems. Our analysis is of interest for the study of the ﬁreball evolution in a heavy-ion collision experiment, when
the system at some intermediate stage passes through the QCD critical point. Then, the main question is if im-
prints of the transient critical state can sustain for suﬃciently large times in order to be observed at the detectors [14].

Abstract

We show that the method of splitting the operator eǫ(T +V ) to fourth order
with purely positive coeﬃcients produces excellent algorithms for solving the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. These algorithms require knowing the
potential and the gradient of the potential. One 4th order algorithm only
requires four Fast Fourier Transformations per iteration. In a one dimensional
scattering problem, the 4th order error coeﬃcients of these new algorithms
are roughly 500 times smaller than fourth order algorithms with negative
coeﬃcient, such as those based on the traditional Ruth-Forest symplectic
integrator. These algorithms can produce converged results of conventional
second or fourth order algorithms using time steps 5 to 10 times as large.
Iterating these positive coeﬃcient algorithms to 6th order also produced better
converged algorithms than iterating the Ruth-Forest algorithm to 6th order
or using Yoshida’s 6th order algorithm A directly.

I. INTRODUCTION

Understanding the dynamics of quantum evolution is of fundamental importance in all
ﬁelds of physics and chemistry. Basic improvement in algorithms for solving the time-
dependent Schro¨odinger equation can therefore impact many areas of basic research. Among
numerical techniques developed for solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation [1–3]
(see T. N. Truong et al. [4] for earlier references), the method of split-operator [2], or its
higher order variant, the method of symplectic integrator [5–7], has the advantage of being
unitary, remain applicable in higher dimensions and easily generalizable to higher order.
The disadvantage is that the time step size needed for convergence seemed to be small and
many iterations are required for evolving system forward in time. In this work, We show
that the method of factorizing the evolution operator to fourth order with purely positive
coeﬃcients, which have yielded a new class of gradient symplectic integrators for solving
classical dynamical problems [8,9], also produces algorithms capable of solving the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation with time steps 5 to 10 times as large as before.

where we have indicated the error term as ǫ3C. Thus
to the Hamitonian H (2) = T + V + ǫ2C +
which deviates from the original Hamiltonian by
an error term second order in ǫ. Since the kinetic energy operator is diagonal in momentum
space, the split operator approach shuﬄes the wavefunction back and forth between real
and Fourier space. (See detailed discussion by Takahashi and Ikeda [5].) Every occurrence
of eǫT requires two Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), one direct and one inverse.
In this
approach, the generalization to higher dimension is straightforward, limited only by the
expense of higher dimensional Fourier transforms. Moreover, every factorization of the
evolution operator eǫ(T +V ) in the above form is unitary.

· · ·

One advantage of the split operator approach is that higher order algorithms can be
constructed easily. For example, the evolution operator can be factorized to arbitrarily high
order in the form [10–12]

with coeﬃcients
determined by the required order of accuracy. This factorization
process is identical to the derivation of symplectic algorithms for solving classical dynamical
problems [13]. However, Suzuki [14] has proved that, beyond second order, any factorization
of the form (3) must produce some negative coeﬃcients in the set
, corresponding to
some steps in which the system is evolved backward in time. While this is not detrimental
in solving classical or quantum mechanical problems, it is observed that in the classical case
the resulting higher order symplectic algorithms converge only for very small ranges of ∆t
and is far from optimal [9]. As we will show below, the same is true for quantum algorithms.
In this work, we show that insisting on factorizing the the Schr¨odinger evolution operator
to 4th order with purely positive time steps yielded algorithms with excellent convergent
properties at large time steps.

An example of 4th order splitting with negative coeﬃcient is the Ruth-Forest [15] scheme,

Note that scheme A, remarkably, only requires 4 FFTs. Chin’s splitting scheme C,

which minimizes the appearance of V for the derivation of symplectic algorithms, has 4

It is
however easy to derive an alternate 4th order scheme with only 3 T operators by splitting

This “split and splice” operation only works on scheme C because this scheme was originally
derived by symmetrizing the splitted product. Scheme D is just the other way of symmetriz-
ing the same product. These two algorithms gave identical results in the scattering problem
solved below. Obviously then, algorithm 4D is preferable with two fewer FFTs.

III. ONE DIMENSIONAL SCATTERING

To gauge the eﬀectiveness of these new algorithms, we test them on a one dimensional

scattering problem, where a Gaussian wave pocket

is impinged on a smooth sech-square potential. The Hamiltonian is given by

H =

This choice of the potential is dictated by the fact that its transmission coeﬃcient is known
analytically [7]

.

We choose V0 = 48.2 so that when the initial energy E0 = 1
coeﬃcient is 0.520001, which is practically 0.52 for our purpose.

2k2

0 is equal to V0, the transmission

−

To compute the transmission coeﬃcient, we evolve the Gaussian wave pocket initially
suﬃciently far from the barrier and then integrate the transmitted wave pocket after a time
of tmax = 20, when the latter is well separated from the reﬂected wave . We use 212 = 4096
grid points over a length of 600, yielding a discretization spacing of ∆x
0.15. Using
more grid points than this has no measurable impact on the ﬁnal results. We found that
in order to reproduce the analytical transmission coeﬃcient, it is necessary to use a very
ﬂat Gaussian incident wave pocket. We therefore take σ = 20 and place the wave pocket
initially at x0 =

80.

≈

Fig. 1 shows the resulting transmission coeﬀcient for various algorithms as a function
of the time step size ∆t at an incident energy of E0 = V0. Even with such a ﬂat Gaussian
incident wave pocket, at the smallest time step for the best algorithm, the transmission
coeﬃcient converges only to T0 = 0.519905 . While this value is still slightly below the exact
value due to a ﬁnite sized Guassian wave pocket, it is a perfectly acceptable benchmark to
compare all algorithms with identical starting conditions.

The second order results (2), denoted by asterisks, can be accurately ﬁtted by T0−

0.36∆t2
for ∆t < 0.1, demonstrating its quadratic convergence. The results of the Ruth-Forest
74∆t4 over the same range as shown, verifying it
scheme (4), can also be well ﬁtted by T0 −
quartic convergence. However, it is clearly obvious that the range of convergence of the RF
algorithm is not substantially greater than that of the second order algorithm, perhaps at
most a factor of three greater. In comparison, the four 4th order algorithms with positive
splitting coeﬃcients are distinctly superior. Whereas the fourth order error coeﬃcient of the
Ruth-Forest algorithm is 74, the corresponding coeﬃcients for algorithms 4A, 4B, 4C and
4D are respectively, -1.07, -0.38, 0.14 and 0.14 respectively. Algorithm 4C and 4D yielded
identical results. Algorithm 4D’s error coﬃcient is more than 500 times smaller than that
of RF, and can achieve the same accuracy by using step sizes nearly 5 times as large. The
comparison with second order results is even more favorable; the step size can be 10-15

4

times as large. To compare the computational eﬀort involve, we timed each algorithm for
160 iterations on a Pentium II 450 MH processor using a Fortran compiler. The second order
algorithm took T2 = 5.33s. Relative to this time, the time required by algorithms RF, 4A,
4B, 4C, 4D are respectively, 2.98T2, 2.22T2, 3.37T2, 3.97T2, and 3.26T2 respectively, which
roughly scale with the number of FFTs used in each algorithm. Algorithm 4A is specially
notable in that it is roughly 1/3 faster than RF but converges at time steps nearly 10 times
as large. We have used algorithm 4A at time step size ∆t = 0.1 to compute the transmission
coeﬃcient as a function of the incident energy. Over the range of E0/V0 = 0.8 to 1.2, where
the transmission coeﬃcient goes from 0.0016 to 0.9974, the results are in agreement with
the exact value (14) to at least three decimal places.

At present, no 6th order factorization with positive coeﬃcients are known. However,
one can use the triplet construction (5) to build a 6th order algorithm by iterating on
three 4th order algorithms. Fig. 2 shows the resulting convergence curves for various 6th
order algorithms. The solid triangles corresponds to iterating on the RF algorithm to 6th
order (RF6). There is no visible improvement in the convergence range. This algorithm
requires 18 FFTs. The asterisks are Yoshida’s [12] 6th order algorithm A (Y6A) , which is a
product of 7 second order algorithms (2) some with negative coeﬃcients, requiring 14 FFTs.
Its convergence range is about twice that of the RF6 algorithm. The hollow diamonds,
hollow circles, and solid circles are 6th order results based on algorithms 4A, 4B, and 4D
respectively, and will be referred to as due to algorithms 6A, 6B, and 6D respectively. Note
that algorithm 6A only requires 12 FFTs. By ﬁtting a polynomial of orders 6 to 12 in ∆t, we
extracted the 6th order error coeﬃcients for each algorithms. For algorithms RF6, Y6A, 6A,
6B and 6D, the error coeﬃcients are -7675, -171, -17.42, -6.887, and 5.819 respectively. The
new, gradient algorithms are orders of magnitude better than previous 6th order algorithms.
Algorithm 6B’s results are so ﬂat that they can be ﬁtted by a polynomial in (∆t)8 alone. For
comparsion, we have also replotted the 4th order results due algorithm 4D as a dashed line.
Algorithms RF6 and Y6A are not even better than 4D. Since all these 6th order algorithms,
with the exception of Y6A, are just the product of three 4th order algorithms, their running
time simply triple that of their respective 4th order algorithm’s running time. Y6A’s time
is obviously 7T2, which is faster than all other algorithms except 6A.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have demonstrated that 4th order split operator algorithms, with no neg-
ative intermediate time steps, are superior to existing second order or fourth order algorithms
for solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. It is straighforward to generalize these
algorithms to higher dimension by using higher dimensional FFTs. These new algorithms
require calculating the gradient of the potential, but converge at much large time step sizes.
They should be useful for rapid simulation of large quantum systems with relatively simple
potentials.

Our comparison of 6th order algorithms suggests that higher order algorithms with in-
termediate negative time steps are far from optimal. Algorithms RF6 and Y6A, which uses
more negative time steps, are inferior to algorithm 6A, 6B, or 6D. This is the same con-
clusion drawn recently when higher order symplectic algorithms are compared in solving
the Kepler problem [9]. This will impact current interests in implementing higher order

5

symplectic algorithms to study quantum dynamics [5–7].

This work suggests that the continual search for purely positive coeﬃcients factorization
schemes may produce better converged algorithms for solving both classical and quantum
dynamical problems. Currently, there are no known 6th order splitting schemes with purely
positive coeﬃcients.

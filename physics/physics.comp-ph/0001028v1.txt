ABSTRACT

A modiﬁed version of stochastic tunneling, a recently introduced global optimiza-
tion technique, is introduced as a new generalized-ensemble technique and tested for a
benchmark peptide, Met-enkephalin. It is demonstrated that the new technique allows to
evaluate folding properties and especially the glass temperature Tg of this peptide.

Numerical simulations of biological molecules can be extremely diﬃcult when the

molecule is described by “realistic” energy functions where interactions between all atoms

are taken into account. For a large class of molecules, in particular for peptides or proteins,

the various competing interactions lead to frustration and a rough energy landscape. At

low temperatures canonical simulations will get trapped in one of the multitude of local

minima separated by high energy barriers and physical quantities cannot be calculated ac-

curately. One way to overcome this diﬃculty in protein simulations is by utilizing so-called

generalized ensembles[1], which are based on a non-Boltzmann probability distribution.

Multicanonical sampling [2] and simulated tempering [3] are prominent examples of such

an approach. Application of these techniques to the protein folding problem was ﬁrst

addressed in Ref. [4] and their usefulness for simulation of biological molecules and other

complex systems [4]-[8] has become increasingly recognized.

However, generalized-ensemble methods are not without problems.

In contrast to

canonical simulations the weight factors are not a priori known. Hence, for a computer

experiment one needs estimators of the weights, and the problem of ﬁnding good estima-

tors is often limiting the use of generalized-ensemble techniques. Here we describe and

test a new generalized ensemble where determination of the weights is by construction of

the ensemble simple and straightforward. Our method is based on a recently introduced

global optimization technique, stochastic tunneling [9].

Canonical simulations of proteins at low temperature are hampered by the roughness

of the potential energy surface: local minima are separated by high energy barriers. To

enhance sampling we propose to weight conformations not with the Boltzmann factor

wB(E) = exp(−E/kBT ), but with a weight

wf (E) = exp(f (E)/kBT ) .

(1)

Here, T is a low temperature, kB the Boltzmann constant, and f (E) is a non-linear

transformation of the potential energy onto the interval [0, −1] chosen such that the

relative location of all minima is preserved. The physical idea behind such an approach is

to allow the system at a given low temperature T to “tunnel” through energy barriers of

arbitrary height, while the low energy region is still well resolved. A transformation with

2

the above characteristics can be realized by

f1(E) = −e−(E−E0)/nF .

(2)

Here, E0 is an estimate for the ground state and nF the number of degrees of freedom of the

system. Eq. 2 is a special choice of the transformation recently introduced under the name

“stochastic tunneling” [9] to the corresponding problem of global minimization in complex

potential energy landscapes. One can easily ﬁnd further examples for transformations with

the above stated properties, for instance,

f2(E) = −(1 + (E − E0)/nF )−1 .

(3)

We will restrict our investigation to these two transformations without claiming that they

are an optimal choice.

A simulation in the above ensemble, deﬁned by the weight of Eq. 1 with a suitable

chosen non-linear transformation f (E), will sample a broad range of energies. Hence,

application of re-weighting technique [10] allows to calculate the expectation value of any

physical quantity O over a large range of temperatures T by

< O >T = Z dE O(E)Pf (E)w−1
Z dE Pf (E)w−1

f (E)e−E/kBT

f (E)e−E/kBT

.

(4)

In this point our method is similar to other generalized-ensemble techniques such as the

multicanonical sampling [2], however, our method diﬀers from them in that the weights are

explicitly given by Eq. 1. One only needs to ﬁnd an estimator for the ground-state energy

E0 in the transforming functions f1(E) or f2(E) (see Eqs. 2 and 3) which in earlier work

[11, 12] was found to be much easier than the determination of weights for multicanonical

algorithm [2] or simulated tempering [3].

The new simulation technique was tested for Met-enkephalin, one of the simplest pep-

tides, which has become a often used model to examine new algorithms. Met-enkephalin

has the amino-acid sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met. The potential energy function Etot

that was used is given by the sum of the electrostatic term Ees, 12-6 Lennard-Jones term

EvdW , and hydrogen-bond term Ehb for all pairs of atoms in the peptide together with

3

the torsion term Etors for all torsion angles:

where rij is the distance between the atoms i and j, and χl is the l-th torsion angle. The

parameters (qi, Aij, Bij, Cij, Dij, Ul and nl) for the energy function were adopted from

ECEPP/2.[13]

The computer code SMC2 was used. The simulations were started from completely

random initial conformations (Hot Start) and one Monte Carlo sweep updates every tor-

sion angle of the peptide once. The peptide bond angles ω were ﬁxed to their common

value 180◦, which left 19 torsion angles (φ, ψ, and χ) as independent degrees of freedom

(i.e., nF = 19). The interaction of the peptide with the solvent was neglected in the simu-

lations and the dielectric constant ǫ set equal to 2. In short preliminary runs it was found

that T = 8 K was the optimal temperatures for simulations relying on the transformation

f1(E) (Eq. 2), and T = 6K for simulations relying on the second chosen transformation

f2(E) (Eq. 3). The free parameter E0 was set in Eq. 2 or (3) to E0 = −10.72 kcal/mol,

the ground state energy as known from previous work. In addition, simulations were also

performed where E0 was dynamically updated in the course of the simulation and set to

the lowest ever encountered energy. In these runs the (known) ground state was found

in less than 5000 MC sweeps. Hence, determination of the weights is easier than in other

generalized-ensemble techniques since in earlier work[4] it was found that at least 40,000

sweeps were needed to calculate multicanonical weights. We remark that a Monte Carlo

sweep in both algorithm takes approximately the same amount of CPU time.

All thermodynamic quantities were then calculated from a single production run of

1,000,000 MC sweeps which followed 10,000 sweeps for thermalization. At the end of

2The program SMC was written by Dr. Frank Eisenmenger (eisenmenger@rz.hu-berlin.de)

for further analyses.

In order to demonstrate the dynamical behavior of the algorithm the “time series” and

histograms of potential energy are shown for both choices of the transforming functions

f1(E) (Fig. 1) and f2(E) (Fig. 2). Both choices of the non-linear transformation with

which the energy landscape was deformed in the simulations lead to qualitatively the

same picture. In Fig. 1a and Fig. 2a, respectively, one can see that the whole energy range

between E < −10 kcal/mol (the ground state region) and E ≈ 20 kcal/mol (high-energy,

coil states) is sampled. However, unlike in the multicanonical algorithm the energies are

not sampled uniformly and low-energy states appear with higher frequency than high

energy states. However, as one can see from the logarithmic scale of Fig. 1b and 2b where

the histograms are displayed for these simulations, high-energy states are only suppressed

by three orders of magnitude and their probability is still large enough to allow crossing of

energy barriers. Hence large parts of the conﬁguration space are sampled by our method

and it is justiﬁed to calculate from these simulations thermodynamic quantities by means

of re-weighting, see Eq. 4.

Here, the average radius of gyration < R >, which is is a measure for the compactness

of protein conﬁgurations and deﬁned in Eq. 10, was calculate for various temperatures.

In Fig. 3 the results for the new ensemble, using the deﬁning non-linear transformations

f1(E) or f2(E), are compared with the ones of a multicanonical run with equal number

of Monte Carlo sweeps. As one can see, the values of < R > (T ) agree for all three

simulations over the whole temperature range. Hence, it is obvious that simulations in

the new ensemble are indeed well able to calculate thermodynamic averages over a wide

temperature range.

After having established the new techniques as a possible alternative to other generalized-

ensemble techniques such as multicanonical sampling or simulated tempering, its useful-

ness shall be further demonstrated by calculating the free energy of Met-enkephalin as a

5

function of R:

where

G(R) = −kBT log P (R)

P (R) = Pf (R) ∗ w−1

f (E(R))e−E(R)/kB T .

(11)

(12)

Here, a normalization is chosen where the minimal value of Gmin(R) = 0. The chosen

temperature was T = 230K, which was found in earlier work [7] as the folding temperature

Tf of Met-enkephalin. The results, which rely on the transformation f1(E) of the energy

landscape given by Eq. 2 are displayed in Fig. 4. At this temperature one observes

clearly a “funnel” towards low values of R which correspond to compact structures. Such

a funnel-like landscape was already observed in Ref. [8] for Met-enkephalin, utilizing a

diﬀerent set of order parameters, and is predicted by the landscape theory of folding [14].

The essence of the funnel landscape idea is competition between the tendency towards

the folded state and trapping due to ruggedness of the landscape. One way to measure

this competition is by the ratio [15]:

Q =

E − E0

qE2 − ¯E2

,

(13)

where the bar denotes averaging over compact conﬁgurations. The landscape theory

asserts that good folding protein sequences are characterized by large values of Q [15].

Using the results of our simulations and deﬁning a compact structure as one where R(i) ≤
23˚A, we ﬁnd E − E0 = 13.96(3) Kcal/mol, E2 − ¯E2 = 0.49(2), from which we estimate

for the above ratio Q = 20.0(5). This value indicates that Met-enkephalin is good folder

and is consistent with earlier work [7] where we evaluated an alternative characterization

of folding properties. Thirumalai and collaborators [16] have conjectured that the kinetic

accessibility of the native conformation can be classiﬁed by the parameter

σ =

Tθ − Tf

Tθ

,

(14)

i.e., the smaller σ is, the more easily a protein can fold. Here Tf is the folding temperature

and Tθ the collapse temperature. With values for Tθ = 295 K and Tf = 230 K, as measured

in Ref. [7], one has for Met-enkephalin σ ≈ 0.2, indicating again that the peptide has good

folding properties.

6

Yet another characterization of folding properties relies on knowledge of the glass tem-

perature Tg and is closely related to Eq. 13. As the number of available states gets reduced

with the decrease of temperature, the possibility of local trapping increases substantially.

Glassy behavior appears when the residence time in some local traps becomes of the order

of the folding event. Folding dynamics is now non-exponential since diﬀerent traps have

diﬀerent escape times [17]. For temperatures above the glass transition temperature Tg,

the folding dynamics is exponential and a conﬁgurational diﬀusion coeﬃcient average the

eﬀects of the short lived traps [18]. It is expected that for a good folder the glass transi-

tion temperature, Tg, where glass behavior sets in, has to be signiﬁcantly lower than the

folding temperature Tf , i.e. a good folder can be characterized by the relation [19]

Tf
Tg

> 1 .

(15)

I present here for the ﬁrst time a numerical estimate of this glass transition temperature for

the peptide Met-enkephalin. The calculation of the estimate is based on the approximation

[19]

where the bar indicates again averaging over compact structures and S0 is the entropy of

Tg = vuut

E2 − ¯E2
2kBS0

,

(16)

these states estimated by the relation

S0 =

log w(i)

w(i)

− log ˜z − C

(17)

Here, ˜z = Pcompact w(i) and C chosen such that the entropy of the ground state becomes

zero. The results of the simulation in the new ensemble deﬁned by the transformation

f1(E), leads to a value of s0 = 2.3(7). Together with the above quoted value for E2 −
¯E2 = 0.49(2) (in (Kcal/mol)2) one therefore ﬁnds as an estimate for the glass transition

temperature

Tg = 160(30) K .

(18)

Since it was found in earlier work [7] that Tf = 230(30), it is obvious that the ratio

Tf /Tg > 1 and again one ﬁnds that Met-enkephalin has good folding properties. Hence,

we see that there is a strong correlation between all three folding criteria.

7

Let me summarize my results. I have proposed to utilize a recently introduced global

optimization technique, stochastic tunneling, in such a way that it allows calculation

of thermodynamic quantities. The new generalized-ensemble technique was tested for a

benchmark peptide, Met-enkephalin. It was demonstrated that the new technique allows

to evaluate the folding properties of this peptide and an estimate for the glass transition

temperature Tg in that system was presented. Currently I am evaluating the eﬃciency of

the new method in simulations of larger molecules.

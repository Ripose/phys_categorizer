The method is an extension to negative energies of a spectral integral equation method to

solve the Schroedinger equation, developed previously for scattering applications. One important

innovation is a re-scaling procedure in order to compensate for the exponential behaviour of the

negative energy Green’s function. Another is the need to ﬁnd approximate energy eigenvalues, to

serve as starting values for a subsequent iteration procedure. In order to illustrate the new method,

the binding energy of the He-He dimer is calculated, using the He-He TTY potential. In view of

the small value of the binding energy, the wave function has to be calculated out to a distance

of 3000 a.u. Two hundred mesh points were suﬃcient to obtain an accuracy of three signiﬁcant

ﬁgures for the binding energy, and with 320 mesh points the accuracy increased to six signiﬁcant

ﬁgures. An application to a potential with two wells, separated by a barrier, is also made.

INTRODUCTION

The much used diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equation is normally solved by means of a ﬁ-

nite diﬀerence method, such as Numerov or Runge-Kutta, while the equivalent integral

Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation is rarely solved. The reason, of course, is that the for-

mer is easier to implement than the latter. However, a good method for solving the LS

equation has recently been developed [1], and applications to various atomic systems have

been presented [2], [3]. This method, denoted as S-IEM (for Spectral Integral Equation

Method), expands the unknown solution into Chebyshev polynomials, and obtains equa-

tions for the respective coeﬃcients. The expansion is called ”spectral”, because it converges

very rapidly, and hence is economical in the number of meshpoints required in order to

attain a prescribed accuracy. A basic and simple description of the method has now been

published [4], and a MATLAB implementation is also included. However, the applications

described so far refer to positive energies, i.e., to scattering situations, while an example for

negative energies, i.e., bound states, has up to now not been provided.

Since the solution of many quantum-mechanical problems requires the availability of a ba-

sis of discrete negative energy eigenfunctions (or bound states), or of positive energy Sturm-

Liouville eigenfunctions, the S-IEM has now been adapted to also obtain eigenfunctions

and eigenvalues. Since there are situations where the commonly known eigenvalue-ﬁnding

methods do not work well, we present here a short description of our method, in the hope

that it will be useful for the physics student/teacher community.

An illustration of the method for the case of the bound state of the He-He atomic dimer

is presented. This is an interesting case since the binding energy is very small, 1.3 mK
or 1.1 × 10−7eV , and the corresponding wave function extends out to large distances,

between 1000 to 3000 atomic units, depending on the accuracy required. Hence a method is

desirable that maintains accuracy out to large distances, and that can ﬁnd small eigenvalues.

A commonly used method to obtain eigenvalues consists in discretizing the Schr¨odinger

diﬀerential operator into a matrix form, and then numerically obtaining the eigenvalues of

this matrix. This procedure gives good accuracy for the low-lying (most bound) eigenvalues,

while the least bound eigenvalues become inaccurate. The method described here does not

suﬀer from this diﬃculty since it ﬁnds each eigenvalue of the integral equation iteratively

It also provides a good search procedure for ﬁnding initial values of the eigenvalue, required

2

to start the iteration.

where ¯r is the radial distance in units of length, ¯V and ¯E are the potential energy and the

(negative) energy in units of energy, respectively. This is the radial equation for the partial

wave of angular momentum 0. For atomic physics applications this equation can be written

in the dimensionless form

d2ψ
dr2 + (V + κ2)ψ = 0
where r = ¯r/a0 is the relative distance in units of Bohr, and V and κ2 are given in atomic

energy units. The LS eigenvalue equation that is the equivalent to Eq. (2), is

ψ(r) =

where, as is well known, the Green’s function G(r, r′) for negative energies − ¯E = (2M/~2) κ2

is given by

r< and r> being the lesser and larger values of r and r′, respectively, and

F (r) = sinh(κr),

G(r) = exp(−κr).

The Eq.

(3) is a Fredholm integral eigenvalue equation of the ﬁrst kind. Unless the

wave number κ has a correct value, the solution does not satisfy the boundary condition

that ψ(r) decay exponentially at large distances. As shown by Hartree many years ago,

a method of ﬁnding a correct value of κ is to start with an initial guess κs for κ, divide

the corresponding (wrong) wave function into an ”out” and and ”in” part, and match the

two at an intermediary point TM . The out part ψO is obtained by integrating (3) from the

origin to an intermediate radial distance TM , and ψI is the result of integrating (3) from the

upper limit of the radial range T inward to TM . For the present application the integration

method is based on the S-IEM, described in Appendix 1. The function ψ0 is renormalized

3

so as to be equal to ψI at r = TM and its value at r = TM is denoted as ψM . The derivatives

with respect to r at r = TM are calculated, as described in Appendix 1, and are denoted as

III. THE SPECTRAL METHOD

The S-IEM procedure to evaluate ψ0 and ψI is as follows. First the whole radial interval

0 ≤ r ≤ T is divided into m partitions, with the i-th partition deﬁned as ti−1 ≤ r ≤ ti,

i = 1, 2, · · · m. For notational convenience we denote the i-th partition simply as i. In each

partition i two independent functions yi(r) and zi(r) are obtained by solving the integral

yi(r) =

G(r, r′)V (r′)yi(r′)dr′ + fi(r)

zi(r) =

G(r, r′)V (r′)zi(r′)dr′ + gi(r).

Z

Here fi and gi are scaled forms of the functions F and G deﬁned above on the interval i,

fi(r) = sinh(κr) × Ei,

gi(r) = exp(−κr)/Ei,

and the scaling factor Ei in each partition i is given by

Ei = exp(−κti).

Such scaling factors are needed in order to prevent the unscaled functions sinh(κr) and

exp(−κr), and the corresponding functions Yi and Zi to become too disparate at large dis-

tances, which in turn would result in a loss of accuracy. Apart from these scaling operations,

4

(10)

(11)

the calculation of functions yi and zi by means of expansions into Chebychev polynomials,

as well as the determination of the size of the partition i in terms of the tolerance parameter

ε is very similar to the calculation of the functions Yi and Zi described in Ref. ([4]). The

number of Chebychev polynomials in each partition is normally taken as N = 16. The

equations (8) and (9) are Fredholm integral equation of the 2nd kind, and hence are much

easier to solve than the Fredholm equations of the ﬁrst kind.

The global wave function ψ is given in each partition by

ψ(r) = aiyi(r) + bizi(r).

(12)

In order to obtain the coeﬃcients ai and bi for each partitions i one proceeds similarly to

”Method B” described in Ref. ([4]), that relates these coeﬃcients from one partition to

those in a neighboring partition. That relation is

aI,i+1 and bI,i+1.The integration outward is started at the innermost partition i = 1 with

aO,1 = 1/E1, and the integration inwards is started at the outermost partition (ending at

T), for which the coeﬃcients am and bm are given as 0 and Em, respectively. The values of

I dr, required for evaluating Iter in Eq. (7), can be obtained in

terms of the overlap integrals described above, as is described in Appendix 1. The iteration

for the ﬁnal value of κ proceeds until the value of Iter is smaller than a prescribed tolerance.

The important question of how to ﬁnd an initial value κ0 of κ is described in the next section.

IV. SEARCH FOR THE INITIAL VALUES OF κ

Since the present method does not obtain all the values of the energy as the eigenvalues

of one big matrix, but rather obtains iteratively one selected eigenvalue at a time, it is

5

necessary to have a reliable algorithm for ﬁnding the appropriate starting values κ0 for the

iteration procedure.

The present search method is based on Eq. (12), according to which the solution ψ in

a given partition i is made up of two parts, yi(r) and zi(r). In the radial regions where

the potential is small compared to the energy, i.e., in the ”far” region beyond the outer

turning point, the functions yi(r) and zi(r) are nearly equal to the driving terms f and g

of the respective integral equations (8) and (9). Hence, for negative energies, according to

Eqs. (10),

in the ”far” region yi(r) has an exponentially increasing behavior, while zi(r) is

exponentially decreasing. For the correct bound state energy eigenvalue the solution ψ has

to decrease exponentially at large distances, and hence the coeﬃcient ai

in Eq. (12) has

to be zero for the last partition i = m. Hence, as a function of κ the coeﬃcient am goes

through zero at a value of κ equal to one of the the bound state energies.

Based on the above considerations, the search procedure for the initial value κ0 is as

follows: A convenient grid of equispaced κs values is constructed, s = 1, 2, ... and for each κs

the integration ”outward” for the wave function is carried out to TM . T , but Iter is not

calculated. The value of TM is selected such that the potential V is less than the expected

binding energy. The values of the coeﬃcient aO,iM for the last partition iM are recorded,

and the values of κs for which aO,iM changes sign are the desired starting values κ0 for the

iteration procedure. The numerical example, given in the sections describing the calculation

of the He − He bound state, shows that this search method is very reliable.

A. The Numerical Code

The code was written in MATLAB, and is available from the authors both in MATLAB

and in FORTRAN versions. The code that performs the iterations is denoted as Iter neg k,

and the search code for ﬁnding the starting values κ0 is denoted as Searchab neg k. The

subroutines for both codes are the same. The validity of the code was tested by comparing

the resulting binding energy with a non-iterative spectral algorithm that obtains the eigen-

values of a matrix. The potential used for this comparison was an analytical approximation

to the He−He potential T T Y [13], described in the next section. The comparison algorithm

expands the wave function from RST ART to T (no partitions) in terms of scaled Legendre
polynomials up to order N. The operator −d2/dr2 + V is discretized into a matrix at zeros

6

of the Legendre polynomial of order N + 1. The boundary conditions that the wave function

vanishes at both RST ART and at T are incorporated into the matrix, and the eigenvalues of

the matrix are calculated. The agreement between the two codes for the binding energy was

good to 6 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

In the test-calculation for the He − He dimer binding energy described below, the con-

vergence rate of the iterations, the stability with respect to the value of a repulsive core

cut-oﬀ parameter, and also the number of mesh-points required for a given input value of

the tolerance parameter will be examined. A bench-mark calculation of the dimer binding

energy is also provided for students that would like to compare their method of calculation

to ours. In these calculations the TTY potential is replaced by an analytical approximation

that is easier to implement.

V. APPLICATION TO THE He − He DIMER

The He-He dimer is an interesting molecule, because, being so weakly bound, it is the

largest two-atom molecule known. The He-He interaction, although weak, does inﬂuence

properties such as the superﬂuidity of bulk He II, of He clusters, the formation of Bose-

Einstein condensates, and the calculation of the He trimer. In 1982 Stwalley et al [5] were

the ﬁrst to conjecture the existence of a He-He dimer. The ﬁrst experimental indication of the

dimer’s existence was found in 1993 [6], and since 1994 it was explored by means of a series

of beautiful diﬀraction experiments. Through these diﬀraction experiments not only has the

existence of the dimer, but also that of the trimer, been unequivocally demonstrated and an

indication of the spatial extent of these molecules has also been obtained [7], [8], [9]. Various

precise calculations of the He-He interaction have subsequently been performed [10] and the
corresponding theoretical binding energies of the dimer (close to 1.3 mK ≈ 1.1×10−7eV , see

Table 1 in Ref. [11]) and the trimer (the ground state of the trimer is close to 126mK, see

for instance Ref. [12]) agree with experiment to within the experimental uncertainty. The

wave function of the He dimer or trimer extends out to large distances (several thousand

atomic units), the binding energy is very weak, and the transition from the region of the

large repulsive core to the weak attractive potential valley is very abrupt. For these reasons

the dimer (or trimer) calculations involving He atoms require good numerical accuracy, and

therefore was chosen as a test case for our new algorithm.

The transition from Eq. (1) to the dimensionless Eq. (2), is accomplished by transforming

the potential and the energy into dimensionless quantities as follows

V = Q ¯V

κ2 = −Q ¯E

(14)

(15)

where Q is a normalization constant, deﬁned in Appendix 2. For the case of two colliding

He atoms interacting via the T T Y potential we take the mass of the He atom as given in

Ref. [11], for which the value of Q is 7295.8356. For the calculations involving our analytical

ﬁts to the T T Y potential, we take for Q the value 7296.3.

The T T Y potential [13], and one analytic ﬁt, are shown in Fig. (1). The repulsive core

goes out to about 5 a0 and the subsequent attractive valley reaches its maximum depth of
3.5 × 10−5au (approximately 10−3eV ) near r ≃ 5.6 a0. This attractive potential valley then
decays slowly over large distances approximately like r−6. The corresponding energy of the
bound state is ≃ −10−7ev [13]. In the units deﬁned in (2) the potential valley has a depth
of 0.26 and the binding energy has the value of 3.04 × 10−5. The bound state wave function

peaks near r = 10 a0 and decays slowly from there on. The outer turning point occurs near

A. Results for the T T Y Potential

The T T Y He-He potential is calculated by means of Fortran code provided by Franco

Gianturco [14], and modiﬁed at hoc for small distances (less than 1 a0) so that it maintains

the repulsive core nature. The potential is ”cut oﬀ” at a distance Rcut so that for r ≤ Rcut,

V (r) = V (Rcut). The S-IEM calculation starts at r = 0 and extends to T = 3, 000 a0. The

intermediary matching point is TM = 7 a0. The dependence of the eigenvalue on Rcut, and

the rate of convergence of the iterations, are described in Appendix 3. Our choice for the
value of Rcut = 2.5 a0, of T = 3, 000, and of the tolerance parameter ε = 10−12 is such that

the numerical stability of our results is better than 12 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Our value for the binding energy is compared with that of other calculations in Table

I.. The comparison shows good agreement of our result with the literature. The diﬀerence

between our S-IEM result and that of Ref.

[11] could well be due to a slightly diﬀerent

choice of the parameters that determine T T Y.

B. Numerical Properties of the S-IEM.

In order to examine the nature of the partition distribution and the resulting accuracy as a

function of the tolerance parameter ε and also in order to provide a bench-mark calculation,

the T T Y potential was replaced by an analytical approximation deﬁned in the equation

(16)

The parameters p1 to p6 for two ﬁts, denoted FIT 3 and FIT 4, are given in Table 2. The
resulting potential is in atomic units; r, p2, p3 and p4 are in units of a0; p5 is in units of a−1
0

and p1 and p6 are in atomic energy units. For all calculations involving these analytical ﬁts,

Q deﬁned in Eq. (14), has the value 7296.3. Fits 3 (4) produce a more (less) repulsive core

than TTY, and is more (less) attractive in the region of the potential minimum.

Our algorithm automatically chooses the size of the partitions such that the error in

the functions calculated in each partition does not exceed the tolerance parameter ε. At

small distances the density of partitions is very high, but beyond 500 a0 the size of the

partitions increase to about 440 a0. In the region near the repulsive core the partitions are

approximately 0.5 a0 wide, but there is a region in the vicinity of Rcut where they crowd

together much more. The latter is illustrated in Fig. (2) for FIT 4, for Rcut = 2.5 a0, for

various values of the tolerance parameter ε. In Table III the corresponding accuracy of the

binding energy is displayed, for the case that the He − He potential energy is given by Fit

4. It is noteworthy that the number of reliable signiﬁcant ﬁgures in κ tracks faithfully the

value of the tolerance parameter, as is shown in Table III.

By repeating the same procedure for diﬀerent values of λ, one can trace the κ eigenvalues

down to λ = 1. The result, displayed in Fig. (3), shows that the values of κ depend nearly

linearly on the value of λ. Futher searches with values of λ slightly less than unity showed

that the code was able to ﬁnd an energy that is approximately 25 times less bound than the

result for the T T Y potential.

VI. APPLICATION TO A DOUBLE WELL POTENTIAL.

The case for which the potential has two (or more) wells separated by one (or more)

barriers oﬀers another test for the reliability and accuracy of a numerical procedure for

obtaining eigenvalues of the Schr¨odinger equation. The reason is that the energy eigenvalues

are split by a small amount, corresponding to the situation in which the wave function located

in one of the wells has either the same or the opposite sign of the wave function located

in the adjoining well. The larger the barrier, the smaller is the diﬀerence ∆E between the

two energies, and the larger are the demands on the numerical procedure. An interesting

relaxation method for ﬁnding energy eigenvalues contained in a prescribed interval has been

described in Ref. [15]. The double well potential, in the units of Eq. (2) is

V = −Λx2 + x4, − Tm ≤ x ≤ Tm.

(17)

The value of ∆E for the diﬀerence between the two lowest eigenvalues were calculated here by

using the S-IEM method described in this paper, denoted as (∆E)IEM and also by a matrix

eigenvalue method, denoted as (∆E)L. This method discretizes the Schr¨odinger operator on

the left hand side of Eq. (18)

d2
dr2 + V )ψ = E ψ
at the zeros of a Legendre Polynomial of order nL, and then ﬁnds all the eigenvalues of the

(18)

corresponding matrix using the standard QR algorithm. The comparison of the results for

the three largest values of Λ is shown in Table VI, where (∆E)rel denotes the result obtained
[15] For the S-IEM the value of the tolerance parameter was ε = 10−12, and the

in Ref.

corresponding accuracy was suﬃcient to obtain the results shown in the Table VI. However,

it can be seen that the relaxation method is more accurate than the S-IEM method. The

diﬀerence between the results in Table VI could well be due to diﬀerences in the choice of

numerical stability of the QR algorithm is well documented in the numerical linear algebra

literature. The convergence of the Legendre discretization of the Schr¨odinger operator using

ﬁnite series expansions in orthogonal polynomials, such as Legendre, Chebyshev and others,

is also well understood, as discussed for example in Ref [1].

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.

An integral equation method (S-IEM) [1] for solving the Schr¨odinger equation for positive

energies has been extended to negative bound-state energy eigenvalues. Our new algorithm

is in principle very similar to an iterative method given by Hartree in 1930, in that it guesses

a binding energy, integrates the Schr¨odinger Equation inwards to an intermediary matching

point starting at a large distance, integrates it outwards from a small distance to the same

matching point, and from the diﬀerence between the logarithmic derivatives at this point

an improved value of the energy is found. Our main innovation to this scheme is to replace

the usual ﬁnite diﬀerence method of solving the Schr¨odinger equation by a method which

solves the corresponding integral (Lippman-Schwinger) equation. That method expands

the wave function in each radial partition in terms of Chebyshev polynomials, and solves

matrix equations for the coeﬃcients of the expansion. Increased accuracy is obtained by

this procedure for three reasons: a) the solution of an integral equation is inherently more

accurate than the solution of a diﬀerential equation; b) by using integral equations, the

derivatives of the wave function required at the internal matching points can be expressed

in terms of integrals that are more accurate than calculating the derivatives by a numerical

14

three- or ﬁve point formula, and c) because of the spectral nature of the expansion of the

wave function in each partition, the length of each partition can be automatically adjusted

in order to maintain a prescribed accuracy. This last property enables the S-IEM to treat

accurately the abrupt transition of the wave function from the repulsive core region into

the attractive valley region. This feature, once applied to the solution of the three-body

problem, is also of importance in the exploration of the Eﬁmov states [16].

To illustrate this method, the binding energy of the He dimer has been calculated, based

on the T T Y potential given by Tang, Toennies, and Yiu [13]. The result is close to the ones

quoted in the literature, as displayed in Table VII. Additional numerical properties of the

S-IEM have been explored by means of the He − He example. The accuracy of the binding

energy was found to faithfully track the input value of the tolerance parameter, as is shown

in Table III. The meshpoint economy of the method is very good. For an accuracy of three

signiﬁcant ﬁgures, the number of meshpoints needed in the radial interval between 0 and

3, 000 a.u. required only 208 mesh points. After an addition of 70 meshpoints, the accuracy

increased to six signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Expressions for the derivatives of y and z at upper and lower end-points ti and ti−1 of

partition i are obtained by replacing functions f and g by their respective derivatives in

the above equations. Since derivatives of the functions f and g are given analytically, the

values of the derivatives of y and z at the end-points are obtained without loss of accuracy,

contrary to what is the case when ﬁnite diﬀerence methods are employed

Appendix 2: Units
The transition from Eq. (1) to the dimensionless Eq. (2) is accomplished by transforming

the potential and the energy into dimensionless quantities according to Eqs. (14) and (15).

The normalization constant is given by

where a0 is the Bohr radius, 2R is the atomic energy unit (R ≃13.606eV ), ~ is Plank’s

constant divided by 2π, M is the reduced mass of the colliding atoms , and me is the mass

of the electron.

of Q is

For the case of two colliding He atoms interacting via the T T Y potential we take the
mass of the He atom as given in Ref. [11], i.e., ~2/M4He = 12.12 K ˚A2 for which the value

Q = 7295.8356

Once κ2 is obtained as the eigenvalue of equation (2), then the corresponding value of ¯E in

units of eV is given by

It is also useful to express the energy in units of the Boltzman constant, denoted by K in
atomic language. In this case ¯E is given as

TABLE VIII: Sensitivity of the He-He Binding Energy to the value of the cuting-oﬀ radius Rcut

Appendix 3: Accuracy Considerations
The quantities required for Eqs.

(25) and (26) are known to the same accuracy as

the functions y and z in each partitions, given by the value of the tolerance parameter ε.

The propagation of the coeﬃcients ai and bi across the partitions involves as many matrix

inversions and multiplications in Eqs. (25) and 26) as there are partitions, and thus the

accuracy of κs for each iteration, given by Eq. (7), is reduced by tol× number of partitions.
The number of partitions is approximately 30, hence for ε = 10−12 the accuracy of the ﬁnal
wave number eigenvalue κ is expected to be better than 10−10.

The rate of convergence of the iterations is shown in Table VII.

. The sensitivity of

the binding energy to the values of Rcut is given in Table VIII.. The table shows that the

repulsive core has a non-negligible eﬀect in the 7th signiﬁcant ﬁgure beyond 2.5 a0.

Abstract

On the basis of empirical evidence from molecular dynamics simulations, molecular confor-
mational space can be described by means of a partition of central conical regions characterized
by the dominance relations between cartesian coordinates. This work presents a geometric and
combinatorial description of this structure.

Introduction

In previous works (Gabarro-Arpa and Revilla, 2000, Laboulais et al., 2002) it was put forward
the idea that the three-dimensional structure of proteins could be encoded into binary sequences.
For a molecule with N atoms in a given conformation the procedure employed consisted in

- deﬁning a procedure for enumerating the atoms, which gives an order relation,

- forming the set of all ordered sets of four atoms (4-tuples), with size P =

N
4 (cid:1)
(cid:0)

,

- as in the mesoscopic models of macromolecules atoms are represented by pointlike struc-
tures, a 4-tuple determines a 3-simplex†, since the atoms in the 4-tuples are ordered a given
3-simplex can be left or right handed. Depending on the simplex handedness each 4-tuple
is given a sign +/−,

- the set of 4-tuples can also be ordered to become a sequence, from it and the signs associated
to each 4-tuple a sign vector {+, −}P can be constructed: the chirotope‡, which is the
desired binary sequence.

The chirotope deﬁnes an equivalence relation between conformations:

two conformations
belong to the same equivalence class if they have the same chirotope. This generates a geometrical
structure in conformational space: a partition X into a set of regions (cells) whose points (3D-
conformations) have all the same chirotope.

The connected components of such equivalence classes are locally compatible with a central
conical geometry: multiplying the 3 × N cartesian coordinates of a given conformation by an
arbitrary positive factor does not change the chirotope, since under this transformation the
handedness of a scaled 3-simplex remains unchanged. Thus, in conformational space the set of
points lying on a half-line starting at the origin all belong to the same equivalence class. The
term central means that the vertices of the cones are at the origin. In the following, if we talk
about a partition without further qualiﬁcations, we mean a central partition.

This simple result suggests that conformational space can be partitioned into a discrete set
of conical cells, the structure of this partition is encoded by the graph of regions T (X ), which
has as vertices the set of cells of X and as edges the pairs of cells that are adjacent.

Since the graph is connected, there is a graphical distance between cells as the length of the
shortest path between the two representative vertices in the graph. The same distance between
two equivalence classes can be deﬁned as a Hamming distance: the number of diﬀerent signs
between the chirotopes of the two conformations. The latter deﬁnition was ﬁrst employed in
(Gabarro-Arpa and Revilla, 2000), were no geometrical interpretation in terms of space partition
was attempted.

In the two works cited above the Hamming distance was used to analyze clusters of confor-
mations in molecular dynamics trajectories with measurably good results, in these studies when
compared with the classical r.m.s. deviation measure (Kabsch, 1978) it was seen to perform bet-
ter and to be more robust (Laboulais et al., 2002). This good performance can be qualitatively
explained if the mesh that results from projecting the graph of regions onto the hypersurface
where the system evolves, is suﬃciently ﬁne grained to give an accurate measure, at least in the
range explored by molecular dynamics simulations.

Thus it seems not unreasonble to give a description of conformational space based on a central
partition of conical cells. However, working out the set of cells derived from the chirotope turns

† a three-dimensional (3D) polytope with four vertices.

therein.

out not to be pratical, so in this paper we present a partition derived from a central hyperplane
arrangement, where a set of non-coplanar hyperplanes passing through the origin divide the space
in a number of conical regions§.

A central hyperplane arrangement

In what follows RN is a real aﬃne space of N dimensions, and {ei}, with 1 < i < N , are its

unit vectors. We deﬁne the following set of vectors

N = {nij = ei − ej , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N }

(1)

Notice that if u = (1, ..., 1) and nij ǫ N then u.nij = 0.
Associated with this set there is a set of central non-coplanar hyperplanes

Hij(p) = {p ǫ RN : nij.p = 0}

(2)

each hyperplane divides RN into the positive and negative hemispaces

H+

ij (p) = {p ǫ RN : nij.p > 0} , H−

ij (p) = {p ǫ RN : nij.p < 0}

so the hyperplane arrangement determines a partition P of RN into a set a set of convex regions
(cells), where each cell C ǫ P can be characterized by an antisymmetric N × N sign matrix V,
such that if p ǫ C then

Vii = 0 , Vij = 


+ p ǫ H+
ij
p ǫ Hij
0
− p ǫ H−
ij



, Vji = 


−
0
+



∀ i < j

(3)

The geometrical meaning of the sign matrix can be easily deduced from the following example:

let pa, pb ǫ RN be two points with coordinates

ij = + , ∀ i < j} is the sign matrix of pa. Now pb has the same matrix except
34 = − . Thus, for any point p the sign matrix encodes the pairwise dominance relations

pa = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., N )
pb = (1, 2, 4, 3, 5, ..., N )

obviously V a = {V a
that V b
between its coordinates
+ pi < pj
pi = pj
0
− pi > pj

Vij = 




∀ i < j

In the above example notice also that n34 = pb − pa

(4).

Let π(N ) be the set of points in RN whose coordinates are the permutations of the sequence
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., N }, no two points in this set have the same V matrix, and since it encodes the
complete set of dominance relations between coordinates, there is a one to one correspondence
between π(N ) and P, making a total of N ! cells in P.

The graph of regions of the arrangement

In order to study the graph of regions T (P), it is important to notice that V is the incidence

matrix of an acyclic tournament (Moon, 1968).

Tournaments are directed graphs such that between any two nodes there is always an arc (see
example in ﬁg. 1), if vi and vj are two nodes, Vij = + if the arc goes from i to j, we say that vi

§ In what follows the term cone means a region of space determined by a set of vectors in RN

such that for

any ﬁnite subset of vectors it also contains all their linear combinations with positive coeﬃcients.

dominates vj; otherwise Vij = − and vi is dominated by vj.

The acyclic¶ qualiﬁer is because there are no directed cycles in the graph (as can be seen
in ﬁg. 1). This is a particularity of the tournaments that characterize the cells of P: for any
permutation there are always two nodes called the source and the sink respectively, the former
dominates all other nodes and the latter is dominated by every node in the graph (nodes 3 and
2 in ﬁg. 1, respectively). Moreover it is a centrally symmetric hierarchical structure:

• the graph that results from reversing all the arcs is also acyclic,

• deleting a node always gives a subtournament.

This tells us that each N -dimensional cell in P has exactly N − 1 neighbours, since there are
exactly N − 1 arcs in a tournament that can be reversed without creating a directed cycle. These
are the arcs joining nodes whose score diﬀers by 1 (see the legend of ﬁg. 1).

T (P) can be obtained by joining with a line segment the points in π(N ) that are in adja-
cent cells, the result is the 1-skeleton of a convex polytope: the N -permutohedron or ΠN −1
(Schoute, 1911).

The study of the faces of ΠN −1 is an essential part in our study of P, since it allows confor-

mations and groups of conformations to be accurately located within ΠN −1.

The faces of ΠN −1

Central to this construction is the duality between the faces of ΠN −1 and the cells of P:
k-faces and cells of dimension N − k lie in orthogonal linear subspaces. The sign matrix of lower
dimensional cells has zeros in the entries corresponding to hyperplanes that contain the cell, as
deﬁned in (3), this matrix can be represented by incomplete tournaments: these are digraphs
where the arcs corresponding to the zero entries have been deleted (see ﬁg. 2).

Incomplete tournaments can be seen as patterns: we say that a given tournament matches a
pattern if both graphs have the same order and if the pattern is a subgraph of the tournament.
The simplest non-trivial faces in the hierarchy are the 1-faces: edges that join adjacent vertices
(0-faces). As we have seen, adjacent vertices diﬀer in that they exchange the value of two
coordinates, say i and j, and the edge is parallel to the vector nij (4), which is perpendicular
to the hyperplane Hij. This hyperplane contains the (N − 1)-dimensional boundary cell that
separates the N -dimensional cells of the vertices, accordingly its sign matrix has Vij = Vji = 0.

The pattern of ﬁg. 2a, where the arc between v2 and v6 is missing, matches exactly two
tournaments that represent the vertices of the edge segment, also the complement graphsk of
these vertices is a set of lower order tournaments that encode the vertices of a lower dimensional
In our case we have two order 2 tournaments (one can be seen in ﬁg. 3a),
permutohedron.
that represent the permutations of the sequence {56} : the associated permutohedron is a line
segment.

On the other extreme lets look at the (N − 2)-faces. Notice that for the hyperplane arrange-

ment described above if we construct the vector

uα = {uα

α = 1 − N , uα

i = 1 , i 6= α , 1 ≤ i ≤ N }

where 1 ≤ α ≤ N ; the set of vectors

Nα = {nij ǫ N : 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N , i 6= α , j 6= α}

(5)

(6)

and the subset of hyperplanes

¶ All along this work tournaments are implicitly assumed to be acyclic.
k Given a tournament T and a pattern P the complement graph is a graph with the edges that are in T but not

in P and the vertices that are in those edges (see ﬁg. 3).

4

Hα = {Hij(p) : nij.p = 0 , nij ǫ Nα , p ǫ RN }

we have uα.nij = 0 for all nij ǫ Nα. This means that the vectors in Nα are all in the (N − 1)-
hyperplane uα.p = 0, consequently

• the hyperplanes in Hα all have a common intersection: a 2-hyperplane parallell to uα,

• the set of vertices in the N -cells adjacent to this 2-cell all lie in a (N − 2)-hyperplane: they

are the vertices of a (N − 2)-face,

• as can be deduced from (5) and (6), the only arcs present in the pattern of this face are

those that connect node α to the other nodes,

• node α is either a source or a sink.

For N = 6 we have the example pattern of ﬁg. 2b, ﬁg. 3b shows the complement graph which
is a N = 5 tournament, the set of all complement graphs encodes the permutations of the set
{12345}, and hence the corresponding face is a Π4 polytope. This tells us that a total of 2N
faces of ΠN −1 are ΠN −2 polytopes.

Before proceeding further we must introduce the basic notion of product polytope. If P is
a polytope in Rp and Q a polytope in Rq then the product polytope P × Q is deﬁned as the set of
all vertices (x, y) ǫ Rp+q such that x ǫ Rp is a vertex of P and y ǫ Rq is a vertex of Q. Examples
of product polytopes are: the square which is the product of two segments (two polytopes of
dimension 1). The cube which is the product of a square by a segment, more generally the
prisms, which are the product of a polygon (or polytope) by a segment.

The example pattern from ﬁg. 2c encodes a product polytope: the set of compatible sub-
tournaments formed by vertices v1, v3, v4 and v5, encode a Π3, and are independent from the
subtournament formed by v2 and v6 which encodes a segment (or Π1). Thus there are N ×(N −1)
(N − 2)-dimensional faces which are prisms joining two ΠN −3 from adjacent ΠN −2 faces.

It can be easily seen that all the faces from this polytope are either permutohedrons or
products of permutohedrons, for instance the polytope encoded by the pattern of ﬁg. 2d is a
Π1 × Π1 × Π1, that is: a cube.

Notice that for the product of permutohedrons the complement graphs (see ﬁgs. 3c and 3d)

are not connected.

The face lattice of ΠN −1

The diﬀerences among incomplete tournaments, when we disregard the identity of the nodes,
arise from the topology of the graph: number of edges and nodes, and the connectivity. We
can deﬁne an operation on patterns that consists in renunbering the nodes so that the score
never decreases upon increasing the node number. Renumbered patterns are stripped from the
complications that arise from permuting equivalent nodes, a classiﬁcation of these objects based
on topological diﬀerences, is far more simple while keeping their essential characteristics, it results
in a comprehensive synthetic view of the face arrangement. Introducing the permutations between
equivalent nodes is an unnecesary complication that can always be worked out in a later stage.
The set of equivalence classes obtained upon renumbering is isomorph to the set L of parti-
tions of the sequence {1, 2, 3, ..., N } into subsets of consecutive integers. The correspondence is
established as follows

• for each incomplete tournament form a sequence with the partial scores arranged in ascend-

ing order

• divide this sequence into subsets of identical partial scores

5

• replace each element in a subsequence of identical scores by the the corresponding node

number in the renumbered sequence.

For instance from the graph of ﬁg. 2b we form the sequence 111116, whose corresponding partition
is (12345)6. Likewise, for ﬁgs. 2a, 2c and 2d the sequences 123455, 111155 and 113355, give the
partitions 1234(56), (1234)(56) and (12)(34)(56) respectively. These partitions represent classes
of polytopes that are combinatorially equivalent, there are N !/(n1! × n2! × ...) elements in each
class, ni being the number of elements in each subset. Notice that (56), for instance, represents
the set of permutations of the sequence {56}

There is a partial order in the set of partitions, it is based on containment: we say that a
partition set x is contained in y (x ⊂ y), if each subset in x is either identical to a subset of y or it is
a subset of some subset in y. Thus for the above example: 1234(56) ⊂ (12)(34)(56) ⊂ (1234)(56),
also (1234)56 ⊂ (1234)(56) and (1234)56 ⊂ (12345)6, but (1234)(56) 6⊂ (12345)6.

It can be shown that the partially ordered set (poset) L thus deﬁned is a lattice, that is:

for all pairs x , y ǫ L there is a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound.

The lattice poset L for N = 6 is represented in ﬁg. 4, each element represents a class of faces
of Π5, they are arranged in ﬁve rows, the faces in a row have the same dimension which increases
(0 ≤ d ≤ N ), elements in each row.
from 0 in the bottom row to 5 at the top. There are
It should be noticed from ﬁg. 4 the hierarchical structure of L: each interval∗∗ between a given
element in the lattice and the minimal element 123456 is also a lattice. Which is an expected
result: the face lattice of any face is in the face lattice.

A partition of conformational space

The partition discussed in the previous sections is based on the dominance relations among
the coordinates of points in an N -dimensional space, in conformational space the coordinates
of each point are the coordinates of a set of N points in 3D cartesian space, as 3D cartesian
coordinates are independent of each other it would make little sense to translate automatically
the partition described above to a 3 × N -dimensional space, instead we propose the partition
P 3 which is the union of three separate partitions: Px, Py and Pz, that encode the dominance
relations among the x, y and z coordinates of the set of points respectively. Px, for instance, is
generated by the set of hyperplanes
ij(p) = {p ǫ R3×N : nx

ij.p = 0}

Hx

with a set of normal vectors deﬁned as

Nx = {nx

ij = ex

i − ex

j , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N }

where the ex are the unit vectors in R3×N of the x coordinates of the 3D points.

R3×N can be seen as a product space RN × RN × RN , with each factor harboring the x, y
and z coordinates of the set of points. Thus, as the dual polytope of Px, for instance, is ΠN −1,
obviously the dual of P 3 will be Π3
N −1 = ΠN −1 × ΠN −1 × ΠN −1, its face poset can be worked
out from the observation that Π3
N −1 is a (3N − 3)-face of Π3N −1. See for example the symmetric
class of faces (12)(34)(56) in ﬁg. 4, the poset of Π3

1 is the interval 123456 − (12)(34)(56).

Now the question that arises is: how well do 3D N point sets arising from the vertices of

Π3

N −1 relate to the actual conformations of macromolecules ?

An alternative representation of permutations is as 0/1 matrices, these are objects whose
only entries are 0s and 1s with the entry 1 occuring exactly once in each column. As an example
to the permutation encoded by the tournament of ﬁg. 1 it corresponds the 0/1 matrix

∗∗ An interval is a subposet which contains all elements z such that x ⊆ z ⊆ y.

likewise the coordinates of a vertex in Π3
N −1 can be encoded by a three-dimensional 0/1 matrix,
which can be regarded as a cubic lattice with only one site occupied per row in every dimension.
Analogously, we can imagine in 3D cartesian space an N -point set embedded in a cubic lattice
with cell spacing of 1 spanning a rectangle between 1 and N in every dimension with the points
located at the intersections such that there is only one point in every row in any dimension.

We can compare in ﬁg. 5 the 3D stereoviews of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic core Cα skeleton
(ﬁg. 5a)††, with the 3D representation, ﬁg. 5b, of the corresponding Π3
162 vertex within the
P 3 cell. Altough ﬁg. 5b appears to be somewhat deformed with respect to ﬁg. 5a, all the
characteristic folding patterns: α-helices, β-sheets, turns ... appear to be conserved.

This means that a lot of the 3D structure is encoded by the set of dominance relations among

the cartesian coordinates of individual atoms.

Conclusion

patterns

mations

Most of the time conformational space is referenced as an abstract paradigm too complex to
be understood. The aim of this work is to show that the geometry of conformational space is not
beyond the reach of mathematical intuition: with the help of adequate mathematical structures
its sheer complexity can be brought to tractable dimensions, and it can be done with existing
and well understood mathematical tools.

The model developped here oﬀers a number of interesting possibilities

• the structural diversity of a macromolecule can be explored by means of combinatorial

• the classiﬁcation of conformations can give a catalog of structures

• graphical paths can be used to determine and explore the paths between any two confor-

• its hierarchical structure makes it modular

There are shortcomings too: the present model shows a loss of precision in the 3D-structures
obtained; but this should not be a major problem:

• precision can be recovered with the help of ad hoc methods. Optimization of structures

within a cell should not be diﬃcult

• there is no limit to the reﬁnements that can be introduced into this basic model, in particular
it should not be hard to build smaller cells, or to cut the existing ones into ﬁner slices.

The possibilities oﬀered by the model will be the subject of the forthcoming works.

We present a Fortran program to compute the distribution of dipole moments of free particles for
use in analyzing molecular beams experiments that measure moments by deﬂection in an inhomo-
geneous ﬁeld. The theory is the same for magnetic and electric dipole moments, and is based on a
thermal ensemble of classical particles that are free to rotate and that have moment vectors aligned
along a principal axis of rotation. The theory has two parameters, the ratio of the magnetic (or
electric) dipole energy to the thermal energy, and the ratio of moments of inertia of the rotor.

I.

INTRODUCTION

It is common to measure the magnetic moment or
the electric dipole moment of clusters or small molecules
by the deﬂection of a molecular beam by an inhomoge-
neous ﬁeld[1-5]. These experiments take place in the gas
phase using Stern-Gerlach magnets to deﬂect the beam
in the magnetic case[4-5] and using an electric ﬁeld gra-
dient in the electric case[1-3]. One needs a theory of
the moment distribution to relate the observed deﬂec-
tions to the intrinsic moment of the particles. There
are two well-known limits for the distribution, the quan-
tum limit of a spin with a ﬁxed total angular momen-
tum, and superparamagnetic limit, where the moments
are thermally distributed. Neither of these limits is valid
for the typical situation of a nanoparticle, which may
have a moment with ﬁxed orientation in a body-centered
frame, but changing orientation in the laboratory frame.
If we assume that an external ﬁeld is introduced adia-
batically, the distribution of moments can be computed
using the adiabatic invariants of the rigid rotor. This
classical theory and a method of solution was given in
ref. [6]. While conceptually the theory is quite straight-
forward, the computation is not completely trivial. We
ﬁrst present the equations that govern the deﬂections,
and then the computational aspects.

II. THEORY

We consider a ferromagnetic particle having a mag-
netic moment aligned along the 3-axis and equal mo-
ments of inertia around the 1 and 2 axes in the body-ﬁxed
frame. Its Lagrangian is given by

L =

J1
˙θ

˙ψ + ˙φ cos θ

(cid:17)

(cid:17)

where J1, J2 = J1 and J3 are the principal moments of
inertia and θ, φ, ψ are the Eulerian angles of the 3-axis
with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld B. The theory would
be the same for a particle with an intrinsic electric dipole
moment p0 in an electric ﬁeld E, simply replacing µ0B

by p0E in all equations. There are three constants of
motion for the Lagrangian eq. (1). They are the energy
E,

the angular momentum about the ﬁeld direction mz,

and the angular momentum about the 3-axis m3,

m3 ≡

= J3

˙ψ + ˙φ cos θ

∂ ˙ψ

(cid:16)

.

(cid:17)

The last quantity, m3, is only conserved because of the
condition we imposed that J2 = J1. Under the equa-
tion of motion, the variable θ has a periodic dependence
on time, oscillating between two limits θ1 and θ2. For
convenience below, we replace the variable θ by its co-
sine, u = cos θ. The quantity of interest for the deﬂec-
tion measurement is the average moment of the particle
¯µ = µ0 ¯u where ¯u is the average of u over a cycle. There
is an analytic formula for this quantity in terms of the
elliptic integrals K(ν) and E(ν) which can be compactly
expressed in term of the three zeros u0, u1, u2 of the cubic
polynomial

f (u) = (2J1E−J1m2

3/J3+2J1µ0Bu)(1−u2)−(mz−m3u)2
(5)

The formula for ¯u is[11]

¯u =

u0K(ν) + (u2 − u0)E(ν)
K(ν)

(6)

where ν = (u2 − u1)/(u2 − u0).

We use eq. (6) to compute ¯u as a function of m3, mz
and E. However, E changes as the particle enters the
ﬁeld. Assuming the ﬁeld change is adiabatic, the action
Jθ associated with the variable θ remains constant and
thus can be used to determine the new value of E. There
is no analytic expression for E(Jθ) or even for the inverse

function Jθ(E). In the program we compute the latter

In zero external ﬁeld, the action is simply related to the

This relation is useful to make a connection to the quan-
tum mechanical formulation of the problem as well as to
make tests of the program.

The probability distribution P (u) that we seek to com-
pute can now be expressed as the three-dimensional in-
tegral,

P (u) =

3)/2J1 + m2

(9)
where the partition function Z(T ) is the corresponding
integral without the delta function and E0 = (I 2 −
m2
3/2J3. There are two symmetries that
can be used to reduce the size of the integration re-
gion. Namely, ¯u(I, mz, m3) remains the same under the
interchange of mz and m3 and under the replacement
m3, mz → −m3, −mz. While eq.
(9) is expressed in
terms of dimensioned physical parameters, in fact the re-
sults only depend on two dimensionless combinations of
those parameters, namely

x =

µ0B
kT

(10)

and J1/J3 Note that the distribution function is indepen-
dent of the overall magnitudes of the moments of inertia.

III. NUMERICAL

We evaluate the integral (9) using uniform meshes in
the three integration variables, binning values of ¯u on the
mesh points to construct the probability density. This
requires a ﬁne integration mesh due to the singularities
and discontinuities in the integrand. We use a mesh size
of ∆m/I ≈ 0.005 to achieve an accuracy suitable for
graphing the distribution P (u).
It also helps to have
incommensurate mesh spacings for two m integrations.

Another numerical problem is connected with deter-
mining ¯u as a function of Jθ. Both quantities are com-
puted directly in terms of the energy variable E, but to
ﬁnd ¯u as a function of Jθ requires solving an implicit
equation. In the program this is carried out by Newton’s
method; a warning is given if the convergence is poor.

IV. TESTS AND PROGRAM USE

There are two analytic tests that can be made of the
program. The ﬁrst is the probability distribution at zero
ﬁeld, which is given [8] by

P (u) =

log(1/|u|).

(11)

Unfortunately, eq. (6) can not be used at B = 0 because
u0 goes to inﬁnity at that point. However, the numerical
parameters in the program have been set so that the dis-
tributions are accurate to within a few percent for values
of x greate than 0.01. Fig. 1 show the comparison of
eq. (11) with the computed distribution at x = 0.1 with
the mesh as given above. The small irregularities are the
binning eﬀects associated with the ﬁnite mesh size.

The second analytic test is the ensemble-average mo-

ment h¯ui at small ﬁelds. It is given by

h¯ui ≈

x

9

(12)

The computed ensemble average for x = 0.01 is h¯ui =
0.000222, in excellent agreement with eq. (12).

The program runs without any input ﬁle, as all of the
parameters have been set in the Fortran coding. The
important physical parameters x and J1/J3 are speciﬁed
on lines 22 and 25 of the code, respective. Running the
code with the values given,

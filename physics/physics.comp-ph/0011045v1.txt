of the system.

Let us onsider the following analytial model

to alulate the folding rate of two onneted mi-

Rmax = RA + RB + shortest intervening hain lenght

rodomains A and B that oalese into AB.

The boundary onditions on the probability den-

di(cid:27)usion-ollision folding kinetis for a large number

of pairings n, is (cid:28)nding the upper bound of the di(cid:27)u-

to be found for every transition and is then used to

alulate the folding rate kf for that transition. The

For our example of N = 11 mirodomains, the adja-

Table VI. Coalesene between mirodomains 3 and 9

hanges the adjaeny matrix (AM ), so that 3 is now

a neighbor to 10 and 8, and 9 is a neighbor to 2 and

problem beomes ompliated even for a small num-

ber of pairings, like n = 5 or 6. The di(cid:27)erent mi-

rodomain onformations make it very hard to (cid:28)nd

Table VII, as new nonzero elements.

In order to (cid:28)nd Rmax between two beads i and j,

what is the maximal distane between the pairings

illustration of the problem and the algorithm that is

getting from i to j, for a given onformation of the

The program that alulates Rmax , starts from the

in a ertain diretion (left and right diagonal, sine

two di(cid:27)erent diretions that the steps (distane) an

tion of states, independent pathways, transitions, and

Rmax is too lengthy, and suseptible to error, if ar-

be taken, indiated by the yellow olor (from left to

pairings and atual pairs, mirodomain radii and dis-

tanes between mirodomains are input parameters.

This is indiated by the light blue olored elements

In this work we present a molecular dynamics simulation of a F F M experiment. The tip-sample
interaction is studied by varying the normal force in the tip and the temperature of the surface. The
friction force, cA, at zero load and the friction coeﬃcient, µ, were obtained. Our results strongly
support the idea that the eﬀective contact area, A, decreases with increasing temperature and the
friction coeﬃcient presents a clear signature of the premelting process of the surface.

INTRODUCTION

Friction is one of the oldest phenomenon studied in
natural sciences.
In a macroscopic scale it is known
that the friction force between surfaces satisﬁes the fol-
lowing rules: (1) The friction is independent of contact
area between surfaces; (2) It is proportional to the nor-
mal force applied between surfaces and (3) The kinetic
friction force is independent of relative speed between
surfaces[1]. Considering that friction is the result of many
microscopic interactions between the building atoms at
the surfaces, it must depend on factors as roughness ,
temperature and the energy dissipation mechanism at
the surfaces. Therefore, to understand its macroscopic
behavior it is necessary to understand in details the dy-
namics of interaction between atoms in the surfaces in
contact. In 1987, C. M. Mat et al[2] have used, for the
ﬁrst time, the Friction Force Microscope (FFM) to in-
vestigate friction in nano-scale. That kind of microscope
allows the experimentalist to produce essentially a single
contact between a sharp tip, of atomic dimensions, and
Its basic principle is shown in ﬁg-
the surface.

surface while it moves at constant velocity, v, parallel to
the surface. The resulting force in the cantilever makes
a torsion on it. This torsion can be observed by optical
techniques. One of the more striking eﬀects observed is
the stick-slip phenomenon: The friction force plotted as
a function of time exhibits a sawtooth behavior. [6, 7].

Analytically, the motion of the tip can be modelled as
follows. Forces in the tip are a sum of two terms: An
interaction force between the tip and the surface due
to the periodic atomic arrangement of the lattice and
a force due to the cantilever. Some authors by using
this approach were able to reproduce several features
of the friction at a nanoscopic scale [8, 9]. In this work
we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to study
the friction phenomenon at the atomic scale. In ﬁgure
2 we show a schematic view of the model we have used
in our simulation to reproduce the F F M mechanism
(Figure 1). The tip is represented by a single particle
that interacts with the surface through a convenient
potential. The springs represent the mechanism we
have used to vary the normal force (z direction) and
to measure the lateral force (x and y directions). By
measuring both forces it is possible to study the friction
force behavior under several circumstances.

In a recent work Resende and Costa [10] using molecu-
lar dynamic simulation have studied the migration of an
individual atom on the surface of a 12 − 6 Lennard-Jones
bcc crystal. They argued that an observed anomaly oc-
curring in the diﬀusion constant can be the signature of a
pre-melting process. The migration of an ad-atom at the
surface may occurs by three mechanisms. At low tem-
perature the adsorbed particle can move through chan-
nels on the surface since thermal motion of atoms at the
surface have low amplitude. Once temperature rises we
reach an intermediate state. The surface starts to melt
so that the channels are closed and ad-atoms are stuck in
the vicinity of a surface atom. The situation persists until
the ad-atom is thermally activated and random-walk dif-
fusion occurs. In summary, the diﬀusion constant should
present a minimum at the intermediate region. Under the
point of view of friction we may ask what is the eﬀect of
this phenomenon over friction. For two macroscopic slid-
ing surfaces we may not expect to distinguish the ﬁrst
two process since the contact area is large compared to

interatomic distance. As temperature rises the surface
is lubricated by melted atoms, we may expect a smaller
friction coeﬃcient. The situation is quite diﬀerent for a
small tip in contact with the surface.

FIG. 2: Schematic view of our Friction Force apparatus.

In the following we describe a series of molecular dy-
namics computer simulation of the interaction of a small
tip with a surface. Computer simulations give us a
very convenient instrument to study tribological pro-
cesses. They allow controlled “numerical experiments”
where the geometry, sliding conditions and interactions
between atoms can be varied at will to explore their ef-
fect on friction, lubrication, wear and to reach unacces-
sible regions for experimentalists. Unlike laboratory ex-
periments, computer simulations enable us to follow and
analyze the full dynamics of all atoms. A wide range
of potentials have been employed in numerical studies of
tribology. For example, simulations of metals frequently
use the embedded atom method, while studies of hydro-
carbons use potentials that include bond-stretching and
so on. We will not concentrate ourselves in any speciﬁc

2

material rather in general aspects of the problem under
consideration. Due to the general character of our study
we content ourselves by using the Lennard-Jones (6 − 12)
potential which is commonly used in studies of general
behavior. We will consider that the interaction of the
tip with the surface does not disturb very much the elec-
tronic structure of the system. This consideration means
that we do not have to deal with the quantum aspects
of the problem. This simpliﬁcation let us save a lot of
computer time.
If, for one side, we lose details of the
considered phenomenon, we gain in that we can study
true dynamical and temperature dependent models.

This work is organized as follows. In the section II we
introduce general aspects of the numerical method used,
in the section III we present our results and in section IV
we discuss and present some conclusions.

II. SIMULATION BACKGROUND

Our simulation is carried out by using molecular dy-
namics (MD) simulation. A schematic view of the sim-
ulation arrangement we have used is shown in ﬁgure 2.
Three springs of elastic constants kx, ky and kz are at-
tached to the particle M that represents a tip point. This
arrangement allow us to measure normal (Fz) and paral-
lel (Fx, Fy) forces on M . The surface is represented by an
arrangement of particles which interact with each other
and with the mass M through a truncated Lennard-Jones
(6 − 12) (LJ) potential

The indexes i and j stands for position vectors −→ri and
−→rj respectively, and 1 ≤ i ≤ N , where N is the to-
tal number of particles and ri,j = |rj − ri|. A cutoﬀ,
is introduced in the potential in order to acceler-
rc,
ate the simulation.
If the force on a particle is found
by summing contributions from all particles acting upon
it, then this truncation limits the computation time to
an amount proportional to the total number of particles
N . Of course, this truncation introduces discontinuities
both in the potential and the force. To smooth these dis-
continuities we introduce the constant term φ(rc). An-
other term (∂φi,j(ri,j )/∂ri,j)ri,j =rc
is introduced to re-

move the force discontinuity. Particles in the simulation
move according to Newton’s law of motion, which gener-
ates a set of 3N coupled equations of motion which are
solved by increasing forward in time the physical state
of the system in small time steps of size δt. The result-
ing equations are solved by using Beeman’s method of
integration[11, 12, 13, 14]. The system is arranged in
4 layers with free boundary conditions in all directions.
The ﬁrst layer is frozen in a regular arrangement as in
the (001) surface of a Lennard-Jones bcc crystal in order
to maintain the whole structure as ﬂat as possible.

With the tip far away from the surface we thermal-
ize the system at temperature T . After thermalization,
the tip is pushed in a direction parallel to the surface at
constant velocity vp. For each simulation the distance
between the spring and the surface is ﬁxed at the start,
so that we can control the perpendicular force on the tip.

By measuring the size variation of the springs we can
calculate the lateral, Fx, and the perpendicular force,
Fz, on the tip. The temperature, T , of the surface can
be controlled by using a velocity renormalization scheme
(See for example [15] and references therein). From the
equipartition theorem we can write that

hv2i = 3

kB
m

T.

By controlling the value of hv2i we can reach a chosen
temperature Tf . An appropriated way to do that is by
successive approximations. We chose a set of velocities
{v}0 so that we get hv2i0. By multiplying each velocity
by a factor α0 deﬁned as

α0 =

hv2i0

,

a ﬁrst approximation to Tf is done. By evolving in time
the system we can create sequences, Tn, {v}n and {α}n,
such that after a ﬁnite number of time steps the temper-
ature of the system converges to Tn ≈ Tf . The friction
coeﬃcient is calculated as the quotient

.

Before we start the simulation we have to have an es-
timative of the melting temperature, Tm, of the system.
This is done by performing a preliminary simulation of
the substrate. In Figure 3 we show the total energy per
particle, E, as a function of temperature. The melting
temperature is estimated as the inﬂection point of the
curve. We ﬁnd Tm ≈ 1.1 in accordance with earlier calcu-
lations [10, 15, 16, 17]. The velocity, position and forces
are stored at each time step for further analysis. We
measure the time t, temperature T and forces in units of
σ

m/ǫ, ǫ/kB and ǫ/σ respectively.

FIG. 4: The friction force,hFxi as a function of normal force, hFzi
is shown for several temperatures. The hFxi and hFzi forces are
measured in units of ǫ/σ. The ﬁgures, from a to e are for several

or equivalently, the normal force in the tip. In ﬁgure 4
we show a plot of our MD simulation results for the fric-
tion force as a function of normal force for several tem-
peratures. The Amonton’s Law of friction states that
frictional forces are proportional to the normal force and
independent of the contact area. This type of behav-
ior was observed in some systems by many authors, who
ﬁtted hFxi to a linear function of both load,hFzi, and
contact area, A:

hFxi = µhFzi + cA.

(6)

Here µ is the friction coeﬃcient and the second term
cA is interpreted as the friction force for zero normal
force. Ringlein et. al.[18] showed that the friction forces
in nanometric adhesive systems depends on the contact
area, breaking down the Amonton’s law. Because we use
the LJ force between the tip and the surface is adhesive.
In the following we present our results that strongly sug-
gest that the Amonton’s laws[18, 19] is violated when the
friction force is considered as a function of temperature.
In the ﬁgure 5(left) we show a plot of cA as a function
of temperature. We can see that when the temperature
increases the contact area or adhesion forces decrease.
This behavior can be related to the fact that at low tem-
perature the atoms at the surface perform low amplitude

jumps so that the number of collisions with the tip is low.
In this case the eﬀective contact area is high because the
tip stays a long time close to the surface. However, when
the temperature grows the number of high energy ﬂuctu-
ations of particles at the surface increases with a conse-
quent increase in the number of collisions of high energy
with the tip, decreasing the eﬀective contact area. We
also observe that the friction coeﬃcient (Shown in ﬁgure
5(right)) grows abruptly at T ∼ 0.7ε/kb. In the follow-
ing we discuss the fact that this behavior can be related
to the pre-melting of the surface. We show in ﬁg. 6 a
plot of the path of the tip over the surface for several
temperatures and normal forces. As should be expected
the paths are well deﬁned for low temperatures becoming
random as temperature grows. To understand what is
going on, we have calculated the residence time of the tip

in each site, deﬁned as the time that the tip spent in the
neighborhood of a speciﬁc site, i.e., its distance to some
particular site being smaller than some reference distance
δ. With no loss of generality we choose δ = σ, the lattice
parameter.
In ﬁgure 7 and 8 we show the histograms
for normal forces Fz = −1.09, −1.02, −0.95, −0.42, −0.14
and Fz = 2.05, 2.09, 2.13, 2.52, 2.56 respectively for sev-
eral temperatures. For negative values of Fz the residence
time is well deﬁned even at high temperatures having its
average at δt ≈ 50. The tip is immersed in the surface,
so that, it can easily travel along channels on the surface
of the crystal. In the ﬁgure 8 we show the histograms
for positive values of Fz. The temperatures are the same
as in ﬁgure 4. At low T they show a similar behavior
as that for Fz < 0. However, at higher temperatures,
the residence time spreads out to the higher t region.
We interpret this as a closing of the channels discussed
above due to thermic motion of the particles at the sur-
face. When temperature increases the particle gets more
energy, which is eventually enough to push it from any
speciﬁc neighborhood.

IV. CONCLUSION

5

We have performed a molecular dynamics simulation of
a F F M experiment. Our results were obtained by vary-
ing the normal force in the tip and the temperature of the
surface. The behavior of the cA term in the Amonton’s
law (eq.

6) and the friction coeﬃcient were found to depend
on the temperature. The cA term which measures es-
sentially the eﬀective contact area, A, between the tip
and the surface were found to decrease with increasing
T . The friction coeﬃcient presents a sudden jump which
seems to be related to the premelting processes of the
surface.

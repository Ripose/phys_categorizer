Abstract

We present new measures of complexity and their application to
event related potential data. The new measures base on structures of
recurrence plots and makes the identiﬁcation of chaos-chaos transitions
possible. The application of these measures to data from single-trials of
the Oddball experiment can identify laminar states therein. This offers
a new way of analyzing event-related activity on a single-trial basis.

1 Introduction

Neurons are known to be nonlinear devices because they become activated
when their somatic membrane potential crosses a certain threshold [Kan-
del et al., 1995]. This nonlinearity is one of the essentials in neural mod-
elling which leads to the sigmoidal activation functions of neural networks
[Amit, 1989]. The activity of large formations of neurons is macroscopically
measurable as the electroencephalogram (EEG) at the human scalp which
results from a spatial integration of postsynaptic potentials [Nunez, 1981].
However, it is an unsolved problem whether the EEG should be treated
as a time series stemming from a linear or a nonlinear dynamical system.
Applying nonlinear techniques of data analysis to EEG measurements has
a long tradition. Most of these efforts have been done by computing the
correlation dimension of spontaneous EEG [e. g. Babloyantz et al., 1985;
Rapp et al., 1986; Gallez and Babloyantz, 1991; Lutzenberger et al., 1992;
Pritchard and Duke, 1992]. Theiler et al. [1992] applied the technique of
surrogate data to correlation dimensions of EEG and reported that there is
no evidence of low-dimensional chaos but of signiﬁcance for nonlinearity in
the data.

While correlation dimensions are only well deﬁned for stationary time se-
ries generated by a low-dimensional dynamical system moving around an
attractor, these measures fail in investigating event-related brain poten-
tials [ERPs, Sutton et al., 1965] since they are nonstationary by deﬁnition.
Traditionally, ERP waveforms are determined by computing an ensemble
average over a collection of stimulus time locked EEG trials. This is based
on the following assumptions: (1) the presentation of stimuli of the same
kind is followed by the same sequence of processing steps, (2) these pro-
cessing steps always lead to activation of the same brain structures, (3)
this activation always elicits the same pattern of electrophysiological activ-
ity, which can be measured at the scalp [R¨osler, 1982] and (4) spontaneous
activity is stationary and ergodic [beim Graben et al., 2000].

By averaging the data-points time-locked to the stimulus presentation
(cf. Oddball experiment) it is possible to ﬁlter out the signal (ERP) of the
noise (spontaneous activity). In the next step the functional signiﬁcance
of a component is assessed. Antecedent conditions of the occurrence of a
component and variables, which inﬂuence its parameters are deﬁned. Now
the commonalities of these factors are identiﬁed. The generalization of all
empirically found inﬂuencing factors leads to a more abstract cognitive the-
ory of the functional meaning of a event-related potential component and
makes it usable for the validation of models of cognitive processes.

The disadvantage of the averaging method is the high number of trials
needed to reduce the signal-to-noise-ratio [Kutas and Petten, 1994]. This
is crucial for example for clinical studies, for studies with children and for
studies, in which repeating a task would inﬂuence the performance. So it is
desirable to ﬁnd new ways of analyzing event-related activity on a single-
trial basis. Applying nonlinear methods to electrophysiological data could
be one way of dealing with this problem.

To compute dimensions of ERPs, Moln ´ar et al. [1995] used the pointwise
dimensions and reported a drop of the pointwise dimension as a function
of time corresponding to the P300 component observed in the Oddball ex-
periment. Recently, concepts of information theory have been introduced to
analyse ERPs. On one hand this is the wavelet entropy of Quiroga et al.
[2001] and on the other hand symbolic dynamics of EEG and ERP [beim
Graben et al., 2000; Frisch et al., 2002; Steuer, 2002; Schack, 2002].

A further promising approach is the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis (RQA),
which is based on the quantiﬁcation of the diagonal oriented structures in
recurrence plots [RPs, Webber Jr. and Zbilut, 1994; Zbilut and Webber
Jr., 1992]. The RQA was broadly applied in a wide ﬁeld of the analysis of
physiological data [e. g. Casdagli, 1997; Faure and Korn, 1998; Thomasson
et al., 2001; Marwan et al., 2002]. The important advantage of methods
based on the quantiﬁcation of RPs is that the required data length can be
relatively short. However, the measures of the classical RQA are only able
to recognize transitions between periods and chaos and vice versa [Trulla
et al., 1996]. In this work, we will use recently introduced additional mea-
sures based on RPs in order to ﬁnd chaos-chaos transitions in physiological
data. These new measures use the vertical structures in the RP and are
able to identify laminar states [Marwan et al., 2002].

2

In the ﬁrst section we will give a short introduction into RPs and their
quantiﬁcation analysis. In the next section we will introduce the new mea-
sures and ﬁnally we will apply them to event related potential data gained
from the Oddball experiment.

2 Recurrence Plots and Their Quantiﬁcation

The method of recurrence plots (RP) was introduced to visualize the time
dependent behavior of the dynamics of systems, which can be pictured as a
trajectory in the phase space [Eckmann et al., 1987]. It represents the re-
currence of the m-dimensional phase space trajectory ~xi ∈ Rm (i = 1, . . . , N ,
time discrete) to a certain state. The main step of this visualization is the
calculation of the N × N -matrix

Ri, j := Θ(εi − k~xi − ~xj k),

i, j = 1 . . . N,

(1)

where εi is a state dependent cut-off distance, k · k is the norm of vectors, Θ
is the Heaviside function and N is the number of states. The phase space
vectors for one-dimensional time series ui from observations can be recon-
structed with the Taken’s time delay method ~xi = (ui, ui+τ , . . . , ui+(m−1) τ )
with dimension m and delay τ [Kantz and Schreiber, 1997]. The recurrence
plot exhibits characteristic large-scale and small-scale patterns which are
caused by typical dynamical behavior [Eckmann et al., 1987; Webber Jr.
and Zbilut, 1994], e. g. diagonals (similar local time evolution of different
parts of the trajectory) or horizontal and vertical black lines (state does not
change for some time).

Zbilut and Webber have developed the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis
(RQA) to quantify an RP [Webber Jr. and Zbilut, 1994; Zbilut and Webber
Jr., 1992]. They deﬁned measures using the recurrence point density and
diagonal structures in the recurrence plot, the recurrence rate RR (den-
sity of recurrence points), the determinism DET (ratio of recurrence points
forming diagonal structures to all recurrence points), the maximal length of
diagonal structures Lmax (or their averaged length L), the Shannon entropy
EN T of the distribution of the diagonal lengths and the trend T REN D (pal-
ing in the RP). The computation of these measures in shifted windows along
the main diagonal of the RP enables one to ﬁnd characteristic excursions of
the trajectory in the phase space of the considered systems.

Trulla et al. have applied these measures in order to ﬁnd transitions in
dynamical systems [Trulla et al., 1996]. They have showed, that the RQA
is able to ﬁnd transitions between chaos and order (periodical states). But
they could not ﬁnd the chaos-chaos transitions.

3 Laminarity and Trapping Time

We have recently introduced two additional measures which are based on
the vertical structures in the RP [Marwan et al., 2002]. We deﬁne these

3

measures analogous to the deﬁnition of DET and L, but we consider the
distribution P (v) of the length of the vertical structures in the RP.

First, the laminarity LAM

is the ratio of recurrence points forming vertical structures to all recurrence
points and represents the probability of occurrence of laminar states in the
system, but it does not describe the length of these laminar phases. It will
decrease if the RP consists of more single recurrence points than vertical
structures.

Next, the trapping time T T

is the averaged length of the vertical structures. The measure T T contains
information about the amount and the length of the laminar phases.

The difference between these measures and the traditional RQA measures
is their ability to ﬁnd transitions between chaos and chaos [Marwan et al.,
2002]. For example, such transitions can be found in the logistic map
xn+1 = a xn (1 − xn) with increasing control parameter a ∈ [0, 4] and xn ∈
[0, 1] ⊂ R. For such trajectories x(a) which contain laminar states (e. g. a =
3.678, 3.791, 3.927), LAM and T T show pronounced maxima (Fig. 1). The
application of these measures to heart rate variability data, has shown,
that they are able to detect and quantify laminar phases before a life-
threatening cardiac arrhythmia and, thus, to enable a prediction of such
an event [Marwan et al., 2002]. These ﬁndings can be of importance for the
therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.

In the next section we will apply this extended RQA to physiological data.

4 Event Related Potentials

4.1 The Oddball experiment

As mentioned in the Introduction, the Oddball experiment studies brain
potentials during a stimulus presentation.

The measurement of the EEG was done with 31 electrodes/ channels (Tab. 1).
The ﬁrst 25 electrodes were localized as shown in Figure 2; the others were
reference electrodes. The sample interval for the measurements was 4 ms.

[Figure 2 about here.]

4

[Table 1 about here.]

Probands were seated in a dimly lit room in front of a monitor and were in-
structed to count tones of high pitch. Each subject was tested in nine blocks.
The blocks varied in the probability of occurrence of the higher tones from
10 to 90 %. Each block contained at least 30 target tones. Response was
given in a three alternative choice (using cursor keys of the keyboard). Dur-
ing the test, the EEG was recorded. The stimuli were computer-generated
beeps of 100 ms length. Tones were either high (1400 Hz) or low (1000 Hz).
They were presented with an interstimulus interval of 1000 ms.

After computing event-related voltage averages for the experimental ma-
nipulations (10 % up to 90 % target probability) one can observe a P300
ERP component whose amplitude is anti-correlated to the probability of
the stimuli (surprise ERP, Fig. 3).

[Figure 3 about here.]

The P300 component of the ERP was the ﬁrst potential discovered to vary
in dependence on subject-internal factors like attention and expectation in-
stead of physical characteristics [Sutton et al., 1965]. The amplitude of the
P300 component is highly sensitive to novelty of an event and its relevance.
So this component is assumed to reﬂect the updating of the environmental
model of the information processing system [context updating, Donchin,
1981; Donchin and Coles, 1988].

4.2 Data analysis

Our focus will be directed to the ERP data of two extreme event proba-
bilities. Henceforth, the time (measured in ms) is denoted as t, the trial
number as i and the electrode as e (the allocation of the electrode numbers
with their notion, see Fig. 2).

The ﬁrst set ERP90 contains 40 trials of ERP data for an event frequency of
90 % and the second set ERP10 contains 31 trials for an event frequency of
10 %. Both data sets can be rather well discriminated in the N100 and P300
components by the average over all trials (Fig. 3). As expected, both com-
ponents have increased for lower event probabilities (ERP10). The maxima
of the P300 are located around the central and central-parietal electrodes.
However, the single trials do not obtain such a clear result. The P300 com-
ponent is only well pronounced in 15 trials. When the single trials are
observed, then extreme values can also occur in the ERP90 data and van-
ish in the ERP10 data (Fig. 4). We applied also a statistical variance-based
T-test to the single trial ERP data. However, this method could also not
clearly distinguish the single trials.

The recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis (RQA) is based on the structures
obtained by recurrence plots (RPs). The RPs were ﬁrstly computed for the

[Figure 4 about here.]

5

means of ERP90 and ERP10 over all trials and then for the single trials.
This was done with the embedding parameters m = 3, τ = 3 and ε = 10 %
(ﬁxed amount of nearest neighbours). The embedding parameters were es-
timated by using the standard methods false nearest neighbours (dimen-
sion) and mutual information (delay) [Kantz and Schreiber, 1997]. Due
to the N100 and the P300 components in the data, the RPs show varying
structures changing in time (Fig. 5). Diagonal structures and clusters of
black points occur. The nonstationarity of the data around the N100 and
P300 causes extended white bands along these times in the RPs. However,
the clustered black points around 300 ms occur in almost all RPs of the
ERP10 data set.

[Figure 5 about here.]

The RQA was computed from the RPs of ERP90 and ERP10 for the single
trials, in sliding windows over the RPs (which have the dimension m = 3)
with a length of 240 ms and with a shifting step of 8 ms. This window
length corresponds with a data length of 60 values.

The mean of all RQA variables of ERP10 reveal typical structures in the
data (Fig. 6, right column). They indicate the transitions corresponding
to the N100 and P300 components around the central electrodes. The RQA
variables for the ERP90 do not reveal these transitions (Fig. 6, left column).
The onset of the increasing of the parameter is about 120 ms before the
event. This is due to the windowed analysis of the RPs (240 ms windows).
We have chosen the middle of the RP window for the time, what results in
a 120 ms earlier onset of the RQA variables.

[Figure 6 about here.]

The four RQA variables are quite different, especially in their amplitude.
For ERP10, LAM and T T are the best pronounced parameter and have two
distinct maxima at some electrodes; DET and L reveal these maxima at
these electrodes too, but are lesser pronounced (Fig. 6). These maxima occur
at the transition around 100 ms and 300 ms after the event and occur at the
electrodes F3, F4, FZ, C3, FCZ, PZ, POZ and PO3. Differences between the
various transitions found by these measures also occur in time and brain
locations (electrodes). But, the study was not detailed enough in order to
give reliable results.

The analysis of the single trials achieves similar results (Figs. 7 and 8 show
the results for selected trials). The LAM clearly found the N100 and P300
components for ERP10 in 26 trials (of 31), but not for the ERP90 trials. The
other measures have lesser maxima and, thus, are not suitable for such
recognition.

This result indicates that our introduced measures of complexity (espe-
cially LAM ) are able to recognize transitions in brain potentials, which are
caused by e. g. stimulative events. These transitions can be found in the
single trials, which is an improvement to the classical method of averaging
all observations.

5 Summary

We have applied an extended recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis (RQA) to
physiological event related potential data (ERP). The classical RQA con-
sists of measures which are mainly based on diagonal structures in the
recurrence plots (RPs), e. g. the determinism (DET ), which is the ratio of
recurrence points located on connected diagonal structures in the RP, and
the averaged diagonal line length (L). We have extended the RQA with
two recently introduced measures, the laminarity (LAM ) and the trapping
time (T T ). These measures are analogously deﬁned as DET and L, but pro-
vided by the vertical structures in recurrence plots. Whereas the classical
RQA enables the identiﬁcation of period-chaos transitions, the new mea-
sures make the identiﬁcation of chaos-chaos transitions and laminar states
possible.

The classical method to study ERP data is to average them over many trials.
Our aim was to study the single trials in order to ﬁnd transitions in the
data.

The application of the extended RQA to ERP data has discriminated the
single trials with a distinct P300 component due to a high surprise moment
(less frequent events) against such trials with a low surprise moment (high
frequent events). Considering the raw ERP10 data, the P300 component
can only be found in the half of all trials. Also a statistical variance test
fails to distinguish cleary the trials. The LAM is the most pronounced pa-
rameter in this analysis. It measures the ratio of recurrence points located
on connected vertical structures in an RP. This structures correspond with
laminarity within the underlying process. In the ERP data, the LAM re-
veals transitions from less laminar states to higher laminar states after
the occurrence of the event and a transition from higher laminar states
to less laminar states after about 400 ms. These transitions occur around
bounded brain areas (parietal to frontal along the central axis). The com-
parable measures DET / LAM and L/ T T are quite different in their am-
plitude. There should also be differences in time and brain location of the
found transitions.

These results show that the measures based on vertical RP structures make
the identiﬁcation of transitions possible, which are not found by the clas-
sical RQA measures. They indicate transitions in the brain processes into
laminar states due to the surprising moment of observed events.

A future work will be concerned with the development of a statistical eval-
uation of these results. Furthermore, this investigation has to be extended
to ERP data gained from other frequent events and a detailed study of the
comparable measures DET / LAM and L/ T T should give hints about the
different transitions in the brain processes.

Figure 5: ERP data for event frequencies of 90 % (upper left) and 10 % (up-
per right), and their corresponding recurrence plots (lower plots). For the
lower event frequency, more cluster of recurrence points occur at 100ms and
300ms.

cies (averaged over all trials). Whereas the measures do not reveal any
transitions in the ERP90 data, they clearly recognize the transitions for
the ERP10 data.

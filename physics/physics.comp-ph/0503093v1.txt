We present a theoretical model which describes the polarization modulated and layer undulated
structure of the B7 phase and gives the phase transition from the synclinic ferroelectric B2 phase
to the B7 phase as observed experimentally. The system is driven into the modulated phase due
to the coupling between the polarization splay and the tilt of the molecules with respect to the
smectic layer normal. The modulation wavelength and the width of the wall between two domains
of opposite chirality are estimated.

The discovery of the polar order and macroscopic chirality in smectic liquid crystals of bow-shaped (also called
bent-core or banana-shaped) molecules is one of the most fascinating features found in liquid crystals in the last
decade. These systems represent the ﬁrst example of the formation of chiral structures without possessing chirality on
the molecular level [1, 2]. The polar order and the macroscopic chirality appear spontaneously as a result of broken
orientational symmetries. The most widely studied phase formed by bow-shaped molecules is the B2 phase which
is layered and the molecules inside the layer are tilted with respect to the layer normal. This tilt, together with
polarization and the layer normal, breaks the chiral symmetry. The tilt in the neighboring layers can be either in the
same (synclinic) or in the opposite (anticlinic) direction. Close packing of bow-shaped molecules results in polar order
of each smectic layer. The neighboring layers can be either synpolar (ferroelectric) or antipolar (antiferroelectric).
So, in all, four diﬀerent structures are possible. The adopted nomenclature for these B2 phases is smectic CS,APF,A,
where the indices S and A behind the C stand for the synclinic or anticlinic tilt in the adjacent layers and F and A
next to P stand for ferroelectric or antiferroelectric ordering of polarization in the adjacent layers.

Since the molecules are achiral the tilt of the molecules does not aﬀect the polarization signiﬁcantly and the latter
is determined primarily by the magnitude of the dipole moment of the constituent molecules. Recent experimental
ﬁndings that polar order can exist also without the tilt [3] suggest that polar ordering is a fundamental property
of liquid crystals formed by bow-shaped molecules while the tilt of the molecules with respect to the layer normal
depends on the particular molecular structure.

Theoretical models of the bow-shaped molecular systems are scarce and the origin of the molecular tilt and the layer
polarity is still not clear. The polar ordering is most probably directly driven by the strongly polar molecular shape
[4], and spontaneous polarization occurs due to the polar excluded volume eﬀects [5]. An exhaustive classiﬁcation of
the symmetry-allowed smectic phases was presented in [6], a phenomenological Landau model that produces many of
the banana phases was introduced in [7]. In [8] it was shown that three order parameters (the ﬁrst, the second and
the third-rank tensor) are necessary to fully characterize the phases exhibited by bow-shaped molecules.

Recently, the B7 phase, which shows extremely rich and fascinating textures and has a more complicated structure
than the B2 phase, received considerable attention. J´akli et al.
[9] suggested that the structure of the B7 phase is
identical to the Sm-Cg phase, which is lamellar with triclinic local layer symmetry. The Boulder group suggested a
diﬀerent structure of the B7 phase: it is a polarization splayed and layer modulated structure [10] and their studies
of the electric ﬁeld induced transition between the polarization modulated and the ferroelectric smectic CSPF phase
gave no evidence of the Sm-Cg ordering.

In this letter we present a theoretical model which shows the existance of an instability in the Sm-CSPF phase that

leads to a spatially modulated phase with splayed polarization just as observed experimentally [10].

Since the polarization modulated structure has been observed only in ferroelectric systems where the tilt in the
adjacent layers is synclinic and since the preferred local orientation of the polarization is perpendicular to the tilt
plane, we propose that the B7 phase and the Sm-CSPF phase can be described by an extension of the model that was
developed by the present authors to describe the structure in conﬁned ferroelectric liquid crystals [11, 12]. Within
this model the smectic structure is described in terms of the smectic order parameter ψ, the nematic director n,
which describes the average local orientation of the axes that go through the top and the bottom of the molecules (see
Fig. 1) and the polar parameter p, which is the unit vector in the direction of the local polarization P. Due to the
bow-shaped structure of the constituent molecules, the dipole moment of the molecule is always perpendicular to the

2

molecular long axis. Because of that we assume that the angle between the nematic director and the dipole moment
of a cluster of molecules described by the nematic director is also ﬁxed, and we set n · p = 0.

Due to the vectorial symmetry of the polarization the local free energy contains terms of the form (∇ · P)i, where i
is an integer. This terms can stabilize a ﬁnite splay of polarization. Since the constituent molecules have thicker cores
than tails, one type of splay (positive or negative) is privileged. The use of the terms with i = 1 and i = 2 has already
been proposed [10]. However, the linear term ∇ · P is a surface term, and the quadratic term, even if its coeﬃcient is
negative, cannot stabilize the polarization modulation in bulk sample, such that the volume average < ∇ · P > 6= 0.
So we write the free energy density in the following form:

f =

The ﬁrst four terms are the terms that are used to describe the structure in ordinary, achiral, smectic liquid crystals.
The ﬁrst term gives the nematic elastic energy density. The second term describes the compressibility of the smectic
layers and deﬁnes the smectic layer thickness. The parameter q0 is deﬁned as q0 = 2π/d0, where d0 is the smectic
layer thickness in the nontilted phase. In the tilted phases c⊥ is negative and the D term stabilizes a ﬁnite tilt of n
with respect to the layer normal ν. The ﬁfth term presents the energy due to the dipole-dipole self-interaction, when
all the variables are function of the x-coordinate only. It is important in chiral smectics and bow-shaped systems with
large value of the spontaneous polarization. P0 is the magnitude of the local polarization, ε is the dielectric constant
and px is the x-component of the polar parameter.

The last three terms in Eq.

(1) are new and describe the characteristics of the phases formed by bow-shaped
Kp is the lowest order coupling term between the splay of polarization and the tilt of the
molecules. The term with
director with respect to the layer normal. If the coupling is large enough, polarization modulated phase becomes stable
with respect to the homogeneous (unmodulated) phase. The coupling term prefers negative splay if the parameter
Kp is positive. The term with Kp stabilizes a ﬁnite splay of polarization. The last term is the coupling term between
the polar parameter, the layer normal and the nematic director. This term prefers the direction of polarization being
perpendicular to the plane deﬁned by the layer normal and the director n (in ordinary chiral SmC polarization is
e
always perpendicular to this plane).

The smectic order parameter is expressed as ψ = η exp{iqt(z + u(x)}, where qt is the smectic layer periodicity along
the z-axis, u(x) is the layer displacement from the bookshelf geometry of layers and η is the magnitude of the smectic
order parameter and we assume that it is constant. The layer displacement is related to the tilt ∆ of the smectic layers
as du(x)/dx = − tan ∆. We express the free energy density (1) in terms of the angles α, ϕ, ϑ and ∆ (see Fig. 1) and
expand it around the homogeneous structure with bookshelf geometry of smectic layers (ϑ = ϑB, ϕ = ∆ = α = 0) up
to the second order terms in δϑ, δϕ, δ∆ and δα. In order to check under which conditions the homogeneous structure
becomes unstable we study the eﬀect of the ﬂuctuations with a wave vector q on the structure. The variables are
q Vq exp(iqx) where V stands for any of the four variables ϑ, α, ϕ and ∆. The quadratic part of
expanded as δV =

If the matrix M 2 has only positive eigenvalues the homogeneous structure is stable. Our main ﬁnding is that at some
qcr one of the eigenvalues becomes negative, so a modulated structure appears. The critical wave vector qcr can be
expressed analytically, however it is a very complicated function that depends on all the parameters in the free energy
density. In general the relations are the following:

• The homogeneous structure becomes unstable if (all the rest of the parameters being ﬁxed) the value of

Kp is

• The eigenvector that corresponds to the critical value of q at the critical value of

Kp has the components of
deformations in ϑ and ∆ much larger than the components of deformations in ϕ and α. As expected the
magnitude of deformation in α increases if Knp decreases. The deformation in ϕ is negligibly small.

• Modulated structure results due to the coupling between the polarization splay and the director tilt ϑ. There
are other couplings possible (e.g. between the splay of polarization and the layer compressibility), however they
all give higher order instabilities. The same is true for the term (∇ · P)3. Therefore we conclude that the tilt is
essential to obtain polarization modulated structure.

At

Kp >

p the symmetry-required local preference for polarization is to be splayed. However it is impossible to
achieve splay of the preferred sign everywhere in space unless appropriate walls are introduced (Fig. 3). Two types
of walls are expected, depending on whether the chirality switches across the wall or not.

e

Chirality switching occurs when the molecules rotate around the long axis. Due to the bow shape of the molecules
this rotation is strongly hindered when the molecules are tilted. In order to rotate around the long axis the cone
angle has to decrease signiﬁcantly and we assume that it goes to zero. Spatial variation in the cone angle is coupled
to the layer deformation. The situation across the wall can, in the most simpliﬁed version, be described by no spatial
variation of the director and the polarization director across the wall (see Fig. 3). Then the free energy density has
only three spatially dependent terms:

where w = du/dx. The Euler-Lagrange equation that follows from the minimization of the free energy across the wall
can be solved by the ansatz w = w0 tanh(x/λw), where λw is the characteristic width of the wall, and one ﬁnds

To estimate the characteristic widths the following set of parameters is used: P0 = 300 nC/cm
0η2 ∼ 104 Jm−3
|c⊥|/c|| = 0.1 and Kn = Kp ∼ 10−11 N. We deﬁne the layer compressibility constant as B = c||q2
.
The compressibility is rather low compared to the ordinary smectics [10]. The smectic penetration depth is then
λ|| =
Kn/B ∼ 30 nm. With the chosen set of parameters the width of the wall over which chirality switches is
λw = 0.2d0, i.e. only a few widths of the constituent molecules. The width of the wall over which chirality does not
change is essentially of the same order of magnitude, however the energy associated with the wall is lower since there
is no need for the cone angle to reduce to zero (see Fig. 3).

Finally we estimate the modulation length (λm), i.e. the width of the stripe with the preferred polarization splay. In
a very crude estimate we consider only the terms that contain spatial derivative of the x-component of the polarization
ϑB/Kp. Setting
vector and set ϑ to equal its bulk value. We ﬁnd that the equilibrium value is dpx/dx ∼

Kp at Kp/Kn = 1 (see Fig. 2b) we obtain λm ≈ 80 nm. The
dpx/dx = 1/λm and using the critical value of
Kp (see Fig. 2a). One
modulation length can also be estimated from the critical value of q at the critical value of
ﬁnds λm = 2π/qcr ≈ 10 nm. Both values agree qualitatively with the experiment where the observed modulation
lengths are of the order of 10 layer thicknesses.

To conclude we have presented a theoretical model which describes the phase transition from the smectic-CSPF
phase to the layer undulated and polarization modulated phase. The system is driven into the modulated phase due
to the coupling between the polarization splay and the tilt of the molecules. As the tilt is responsible for the breaking
of chiral symmetry, the instability is due to the coupling between polarization and chirality. The transition from the
homogeneous to the modulated phase occurs if the coupling term is strong enough. Since this coupling depends on the
structure of the constituent molecules, we predict that a small change in the molecular structure, e.g. in the molecular
tail can lead to a signiﬁcant change in the coupling and thus determine whether the system is in the homogeneous or
the modulated phase.

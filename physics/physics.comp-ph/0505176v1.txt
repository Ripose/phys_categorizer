The relationship between the work function (Φ) and the surface stability of compounds is, to
our knowledge, unknown, but very important for applications such as organic light-emitting diodes.
This relation is studied using ﬁrst-principles calculations on various surfaces of BaAl4. The most
stable surface [Ba terminated (001)] has the lowest Φ (1.95 eV), which is lower than that of any
elemental metal including Ba. Adding barium to this surface neither increases its stability nor
lowers its work function. BaAl4 is also strongly bound. These results run counter to the common
perception that stability and a low Φ are incompatible. Furthermore, a large anisotropy and a stable
low-work-function surface are predicted for intermetallic compounds with polar surfaces.

I. Introduction

The long-standing problem of the precise relationship
between the work function (Φ) and the stability of met-
als has become pressing with the increased application
of electron-emitting materials in technology. Two exam-
ples are vacuum electronic devices like cathode-ray tubes
(CRTs) and cathodes for organic light-emitting diodes
In CRTs, a thin layer of a low-Φ metal is
(OLEDs).
often present on top of a cathode made from a struc-
turally stable material to enhance its electron-emitting
properties.1 Electron injection into OLEDs strongly de-
pends on the cathode work function,2 while the lifetime
of the device can be limited by the stability of the cath-
ode material. OLEDs with an alloy interface between the
cathode and the polymer have been found to be superior,
in terms of lifetime and luminosity, to those with single-
element cathodes.3,4 Thus the relationship between Φ
and stability5 is crucial. However, it is poorly under-
stood, especially for more complex metals.

FIG. 1: Schematic illustration of Smoluchowski smoothing of
the electron charge density (striped area) at an open surface.
The grey area is formed by bulk Wigner-Seitz cells. Signs
indicate the net charge. The dipole thus formed lowers the
work function.

The general rule for elements is that a low work func-
tion and high stability are incompatible:
the element
with the lowest work function, cesium (Φ = 2.14 eV),6 is
highly reactive and has a low melting temperature. No-
ble metals (silver/gold/platinum) on the other hand are
hardest to oxidize, but their Φ is at least twice as large
(4.25/5.1/5.65 eV).6 It is generally believed that this
must always be the case, i.e., that a low Φ implies loosely

bound electrons that easily mediate reactions. The work
function surface anisotropy, however, can be quite large:
for tungsten, it is of the order of 1 eV.7 The anisotropy
was already theoretically addressed by Smoluchowski.8
According to his model, at a “more open”9 surface, re-
laxation of the electrons “smoothes” the surface charge.
A dipole moment is built up that lowers Φ.10 This is
schematically shown in Fig. 1. Although the work func-
tion is lowered for a more-open surface, the surface energy
increases and stable, low-work-function surfaces are for-
bidden by the model. Hardly any extensions to the model
have been suggested since,11 certainly not for more com-
plex metals. Experimental results for transition metal
alloys suggest the so-called alloy eﬀect,12 which implies
that the stability and Φ of alloys interpolate between
those of the constituting elements. As a consequence,
it is believed that stable, low-work-function surfaces are
not possible for more complex metals either.

Nevertheless,

the work function and stability of
compounds mainly constitute a terra incognita.
In
this paper, the relationship between Φ and stability of
compounds is studied for the ﬁrst time by calculating
ab initio the structural relaxation, work function and
surface energy of various surfaces of BaAl4. The mo-
tivation to study the BaAl4 system was the successful
use of Ba-Al-alloy cathodes in OLEDs and the high
melting point of this compound (> 1000◦C). In the
Ba-Al phase diagram,13 the melting point of BaAl4 is
the highest, much higher than those of the constituents,
which indicates a strongly bound structure. Moreover,
we show that the work function for one of the crystal
surfaces is very low.

II. Ab Initio Calculations
The BaAl4 crystal structure14 is depicted in Fig. 2. It
is body-centered tetragonal, with alternately three alu-
minum layers (1Al, 2Al and 3Al) and one barium layer

(1Ba) in the [001] direction. Both Al and Ba atoms are lo-
cated approximately according to their elemental crystal
structures (bcc and fcc, respectively). The (100) surface
is stoichiometric and there are four (001) surfaces. They
are constructed by cutting the bulk above the accordingly
labeled layers in Fig. 2. Two other (001) surfaces are also
considered: “2Ba” (one bcc barium layer added to 1Ba)
and “ 1
2 Ba” (half a barium layer removed from 1Ba).

FIG. 3: The BaAl4 (001) 1Ba surface. Laterally averaged
charge density (ρ solid line, arbitrary units) and (electro-
static) potential (V dashed line, eV relative to EF) as function
of position perpendicular to the surface (z). The positions of
Ba and Al layers are indicated with light and dark spheres,
respectively. At −5.12 eV is the average bulk potential and
at 2.79 eV is the highest potential in the bulk.24 The work
function is 1.95 eV.

The work function is deﬁned as the amount of energy it
takes to extract electrons from a metal, i.e., bring them
from the Fermi level to the vacuum. At locations that
are microscopically far from the material, but macroscop-
ically near it, Φ is surface dependent. The work func-
tion at large distance is then an average over the various
surfaces.25 The work function of a surface is calculated by
constructing a supercell with a slab of material, with only
this surface, and vacuum. Fig. 3 illustrates this using the
(001) Ba terminated surface. About 10 ˚A empty space
suﬃces for the electrostatic potential26 to converge to its
vacuum value (Vvac). A thick slab, however, is required
for the Fermi level (EF) to be accurate. A more eﬃcient
method is to link the surface calculation to a bulk one
where EF is very accurate. The average potential in the
bulk (< V >bulk) is set equal to the average potential in
the middle of the slab. Accuracies of a few hundredths
of an eV can thus be achieved with only six to eight bulk
unit cells, depending on direction.27 The work function
of the 1Ba surface is 1.95 eV.

The work functions of the other BaAl4 surfaces are cal-
culated analogously. That of the (100) surface is reduced
by structural relaxation from 3.54 eV to 3.43 eV. The
work functions of the (001) 1Al, 2Al and 3Al surfaces
are 4.38 eV, 4.48 eV and 3.98 eV, respectively. Relax-
ation has negligible eﬀect. The work functions of the
various surfaces are summarized in Fig. 4. As plotted
there, covering the Al surface with half a monolayer of
barium (thus forming the 1
2 Ba surface) already greatly
reduces the work function (2.29 eV). The 1Ba work func-
tion is reduced even more to a surprisingly low value of

ing 2 formula units.

1Al and 3Al
atoms are equivalent
in the bulk.

From bulk calculations we ﬁnd that a = 4.56 ˚A, that
c = 11.39 ˚A , and that the remaining free parameter in
the structure, the height of the third aluminum layer,
is 0.381 · c. These values compare very well (deviations
≈ 1%) with those obtained experimentally.14 The bulk
density of states (DOS) shows a quasi-gap just below the
Fermi level, in accordance with the previously calculated
DOS of BaAl4 and other isoelectronic compounds with
the same structure.14 The valence electrons are mainly
located on Al atoms. The binding energy (Ebind) is
1.42 eV/F.U. with respect to the elemental bulk metals.
Together with the quasi-gap, it hints at BaAl4’s stability.
The ﬁrst-principles calculations were carried out using
density functional theory (DFT) in the local density
approximation (LDA)15,16 with generalized gradient
corrections (GGA).17 We used the total energy and
molecular dynamics program called VASP (Vienna
Ab-initio Simulation Package),18,19 which has
the
projector-augmented-wave method (PAW)20,21 imple-
mented. Nonlinear core corrections22 were applied for
both barium and aluminum. A semi-core of Ba 5s and
5p electrons was included. The Kohn-Sham orbitals
were expanded in plane waves with cutoﬀs of 18 Ry.
The Brillouin zones for the (100) and (001) surface
calculations were sampled with 1 × 16 × 8 and 12 × 12 × 1
Monkhorst-Pack23 k point grids, respectively, resulting
in eight and 21 k points, respectively, in their irreducible
parts. The (periodically repeated) unit cell for the (100)
surface calculation contained a slab with a thickness of
seven bulk unit cells and 16 ˚A vacuum. The supercells
for the (001) surface calculations contained slabs with
thicknesses of six formula units (F.U.) and 20 ˚A vacuum.

FIG. 4: Work functions (eV) of the BaAl4 (001) surfaces.
Experimental bulk values for barium and aluminum are indi-
cated at the borders. Lines connect the data points. Φ for
the (100) surface before and after relaxation is inserted. (The
dotted line is Vmax)24

1.95 eV. This is below the Φ of any element.6 An ad-
ditional layer of barium (thus forming the 2Ba surface)
increases Φ (2.13 eV) again. Experimental bulk values for
Al (4.2 eV) and Ba (2.32 eV) are plotted for reference.6
These compare favorably with calculated work functions
of bcc-barium [2.36 eV (100) and 2.27 eV (111)] and fcc-
aluminum [4.34 eV (100) and 4.17 eV (111)].

The huge (> 2 eV) variation in the (001) surface work
function can be (qualitatively) explained from the dif-
ference in the atomic electronegativities. Ba is less elec-
tronegative (0.9)28 than Al (1.5),28 eﬀecting charge trans-
fer from barium to aluminum. The resulting surface
dipole moment decreases the work function of the Ba
surface to even under the elemental barium bulk value
and increases Φ of the Al surfaces considerably. The de-
pendence of Φ on Al coverage of the 1Ba surface can be
understood if one realizes that the 1Al and 3Al surfaces
are more open than the 2Al surface. According to the
Smoluchowski model, Φ must then be lowered. The de-
crease in Φ during relaxation of the (100) surface can also
be understood by combining charge transfer with Smolu-
chowski smoothing. The barium atoms at the surface
move out (≈ 0.1 ˚A), as they favor an environment with
a lower charge density, while the aluminum atoms at the
surface tend to get closer together, as they favor an en-
vironment of a high charge density. We conclude that a
mono-layer coverage yields an extreme work function.

IV. Surface Energy

The (relative) stability of a surface is determined
by the diﬀerence in surface energy (γ) between two
surfaces.5 The surface energy is calculated as the energy
of a slab with only this surface minus the energy of the
bulk equivalent (formed by merging the [periodically re-
peated] slabs together), divided by two times the surface
area, because a slab has two sides. This method was used

3

for the (100) and (001) 1
2 Ba surfaces. Slabs for the other
(001) surfaces are non-stoichiometric and so there is no
equivalent bulk. Calculating γ now requires reservoirs of
Ba and Al. Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, the
chemical potential of the aluminum (µAl) and that of the
barium (µBa) reservoir are linked to the total energy per
F.U. of BaAl4 (Ebulk):

Ebulk = 4 · µAl + µBa.

(1)

The energy of, for example, the 1Ba surface, as a function
of µBa, follows from the total energy of a slab with these
surfaces exclusively (E1Ba):29

γ1Ba(µBa) = [E1Ba − #F.U. · Ebulk − µBa]/2AS,

(2)

where AS is the surface area.

FIG. 5: Surface energies (eV/nm2) for the BaAl4 surfaces as
function of the barium chemical potential (eV). The poten-
tial ranges from the value for Al bulk to that of Ba bulk.
The diﬀerence is the binding energy of BaAl4 (equation 1 has
been used). For the (100) surface the eﬀect of relaxation is
indicated. The (001) 1Ba surface is the most stable.

The surface energies are drawn in Fig. 5. Structural
relaxation of the (100) surface lowers its energy from
4.96 eV/nm2 to 4.82 eV/nm2. The energy of the (001)
1
2 Ba surface equals 13.3 eV/nm2 and is outside the range
of the plot. For the other (001) surface, γ depends on
the barium chemical potential. In the ﬁgure, µBa varies
over the thermodynamically allowed range between the
Ba and Al bulk chemical potentials30 as phase separa-
tion occurs outside this range. The single barium surface
is the most stable one in the entire region and so other
(001) surfaces cannot be formed.

The unusual stability of the low-Φ surface is explained
in the same way as the relaxation of the (100) surface.
Since barium is the less electronegative element,
it
favors a low electron density and makes the most stable
surface. Additional barium layers at the surface decrease
this stability, as Ba-Ba bonds are less strong than Al-Ba
bonds, especially when the barium in contact with

aluminum is (partially) ionized.

V. Conclusions.
As both the low Φ of the 1Ba surface and its stability
followed from Ba’s lower electronegativity, we come to
a remarkable prediction: For an intermetallic compound
with polar surfaces, like BaAl4, the most stable surface
has the lowest work function and relaxation can only de-
crease it further.

To summarize, we used ﬁrst-principles calculations on
various surfaces of BaAl4 to study the interrelation of
work function and stability. The bulk work function of
BaAl4 is 2.79 eV,24 its anisotropy (1.5 eV) is huge, and
the most stable surface (Ba terminated 001) has the low-
est Φ (1.95 eV), which is even lower than that of pure
Ba. Adding barium to this surface neither increases its
stability nor lowers its work function. The binding en-
ergy of 1.42 eV/F.U., the quasi-gap in the DOS, and its
melting temperature of over 1000 ◦C indicate BaAl4’s

5 The stability of a state implies an energy diﬀerence with
another (transition) state. Hence several types of stability
exist: towards decomposition, roughening, chemical reac-
tions, etcetera. The energy of the roughened surface, for
example, contains contributions from surfaces of other in-
dices. These will diﬀer little for (elemental) cubic systems,
but not so for layered compounds. Lowering the energy of
the state under consideration increases its stability indis-
criminately. Therefore, no distinction is made in general.
The type of stability is speciﬁed only when necessary.

9 An open surface is understood as one with a relatively

small number of atoms per unit area.

10 The energy of a surface dipole is the work it costs to move
an electron through this dipole. Natural as it may seem,
the charge-smoothing dipole moment cannot be used to
split the work function into a bulk and a surface part, as
is often done in literature. Within the bulk, the potential
is periodic (no dipole) and outside it there is no charge.
It follows that the reference for this dipole is the average
(electrostatic) potential on the outer surface of the bulk
unit cells, which means that it is surface-dependent. It is
discussed in this paper.

stability. These results contradict the common percep-
tion that stability and a low Φ are incompatible. They
also run counter to the eﬀect that alloy work functions
are in between those of the constituting elements. Its sta-
ble, very-low-Φ surface and the stable structure probably
make BaAl4 a good electron-emitting material. Further-
more, a stable low-work-function surface promises to be
general for intermetallic compounds with polar surfaces.

24 Although it is impossible to sharply deﬁne a surface dipole
moment (a bulk reference must be chosen) still it would
be useful to introduce a bulk Φ. Fig. 3 shows three bulk
reference potentials: EF, < V >bulk and the highest po-
tential in the bulk (Vmax). If we choose EF, it follows that
there is no bulk work function at all. If we use < V >bulk,
Φbulk even becomes negative, which suggests that the bulk
material does not bind electrons. Φbulk = Vmax remains. It
can be located at a precise position, namely as far as possi-
ble from the nuclei, i.e., in a corner of a Wigner-Seitz cell,
it is always positive (2.79 eV for BaAl4), and the surface
dipole can have either sign, as can be read from Fig. 4.

Abstract

A simple and eﬃcient method for quantum Monte Carlo simulation is presented, based
on discretization of the action in the path integral, and a Gaussian averaging of the
potential, which works well e.g. with the Coulomb potential. Non-integrable hard core
potentials can not be averaged in the same way.

Introduction

The quantum Monte Carlo method is well established as an eﬃcient calculational tool for
many-body problems. See for example the review articles [1, 2, 3]. It is well suited for bosonic
systems without magnetic ﬁeld, where the path integral has only positive contributions. But
also femionic systems can be treated, in spite of the troublesome “sign problem”, just one
application is the computation of the high temperature phase diagram of hydrogen [4, 5].
One limitation is that it is a statistical method, so that every factor of 10 in precision costs
a factor of 100 in computing time. But it does not hit the “exponential wall”, because it
only needs to represent particle positions, or particle paths, and so the number of parameters
increases linearly with the number of particles.

By contrast, the number of particles that can be handled by methods based on computing
realistic manybody wave functions is limited by the exponential increase in the number of
parameters needed for describing such wave functions. The density functional method [6] is
less severely limited, since it uses one particle wave functions, but on the other hand it has
to rely on clever approximation techniques.

The purpose of the work presented here was to look for a simple and eﬃcient way of
handling the Coulomb potential in quantum Monte Carlo simulation. Formulae for the exact
propagator of the two-particle Coulomb problem are known, and can even be derived by
path integral methods [7, 8], but it is not clear whether they are useful for the simulation of
many-body systems. In ref. [4] ﬁtted formulae for two-particle propagators were used. This
may be a good enough method, but it may nevertheless be of interest to look for more direct
approaches.

The Fourier representation of paths in path integrals was introduced by Feynman, to-
gether with the idea of approximately integrating over inﬁnitely many Fourier components

1

by averaging the potential [9]. The method was further developed by Doll, Coalson, and
Freeman [10, 11] under the name of partial averaging. In their work and in subsequent work,
see e.g. [12, 13], the object focused upon has been the propagator, involving paths from one
point to another, more than the partition function, involving closed paths.

The basic idea is to let the path integral include only paths represented by ﬁnite Fourier
series with a ﬁxed number of terms, and to think of each such path as representing all the
inﬁnite Fourier series to which it can be extended. The result is that, as long as correlations
along the path are neglected, each point on one truncated path represents a Gaussian dis-
tribution of points, with a standard deviation decreasing from the middle of the path and
vanishing at the end points. In the case of the Coulomb potential, the Gaussian averaging has
the important eﬀect of removing the singularity at zero distance. It is then a complication
that the averaging varies along the path, disappearing towards the end points [13].

The modiﬁcation proposed here is to average with a standard deviation which is constant
along the path. This seems a natural approach when the partition function is computed
directly, and not via the propagator.
In more detail, the method proposed amounts to a
discretization of the action integral, with an averaged potential, and the computation of the
kinetic energy part of the action by means of a ﬁnite Fourier transform. As discussed below,
within this method it is easy to add to any potential an auxiliary conﬁning harmonic oscillator
potential, which makes the partition function mathematically well deﬁned.

A diﬀerent topic which is not addressed here is the optimization of the Monte Carlo
sampling procedure. See in this connection the comment in an appendix of ref. [13]. A ﬁnite
Fourier transform is a central part of the present method. In the method as formulated here
it is assumed that the number of time steps is odd, hence the standard fast Fourier transform
with 2n points, n = 1, 2, . . ., can not be used. One solution is to use 3n points and the fast
Fourier transform to base three [14]. However, it would also be straightforward to modify the
method so as to use an even number of time steps.

The Fourier components an are complex and satisfy the relations a−n = a∗

This Fourier expansion is the natural one in the computation of the partition function,
which involves periodic paths. A slightly diﬀerent expansion is needed in the computation of
propagators, see e.g. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

It may be useful to sketch the derivation of this Fourier path integral. We start from the

3 Averaging the potential

The integrand of the path integral, Equation (2), is the negative exponential of S/¯h, Equa-
tion (4). One way to interpret this is that the kinetic part of S deﬁnes independent Gaussian
probability distributions for the Fourier coeﬃcients an, n > 0, such that the real and imagi-
nary parts of the x, y, z components of an have mean values zero and standard deviations

The path integral may be computed approximately by the partial averaging method [10,
11]. We integrate explicitly over the lowest Fourier components, and approximate the integral

The present version of the partial averaging method is simpler than the original one [10,
11, 12, 13], in that the standard deviation σ is taken to be constant. The method has been
used previously for computing the propagator, and not directly the partition function. Then
σ has to vary along the path, since it must vanish at the end points.

then the averaged potential W is just V plus a constant,

There are at least three arguments in favour of choosing exactly 2K + 1 evaluation points
for the action integral of the potential. One is that this replacement of the integral by a sum is
exact for a constant, linear or quadratic potential. Another argument is that the real Fourier
coeﬃcient a0 and the K complex Fourier coeﬃcients a1, . . . , aK are just what is needed to
ﬁx the 2K + 1 positions rj.

s(τj)

The third argument is less obvious. In fact, our justiﬁcation of the averaging procedure
deﬁning W suggests that the evaluation points τj should be chosen in such a way that the
s(τk)
covariances
, given by Equation (21), are small. These covariances are propor-
i
tional to the function fK(u) given in Equation (22), which is symmetric about u = 1/2, and
has K + 1 zeros between 0 and 1/2. Of these zeros, K are close to the values uj = j/(2K + 1),
for j = 1, 2, . . . , K, as Table 1 shows. Thus, with 2K + 1 equally spaced points τj we have
that

7 Regularization

For simplicity, we have so far neglected the fact that the partition function is not mathemat-
ically well deﬁned for a system in an inﬁnite volume when, for example, the potential goes to
zero at inﬁnity, like the Coulomb potential. In our present context, the problem is that the
integral over a0 diverges. In practice, when the integral is computed by some Monte Carlo
method using a random walk algorithm of the Metropolis type, the divergence means that
there is a ﬁnite probability of walking away to inﬁnity, where the potential vanishes. This
may be no problem in practice, because the divergence may be so improbable that it will
never happen in the Monte Carlo simulation. Nevertheless, one may like to introduce some
kind of regularization which makes the partition function well deﬁned.

A convenient regularization method in our case is to add to the Hamiltonian an extra

harmonic oscillator potential

with a suitably chosen angular frequency ω0. The Fourier expansion of Equation (5) implies

.

This expression for the partition function Z = Z(β) is mathematically well deﬁned, when
the harmonic oscillator potential V0 is included in addition to the potential V , so that Equa-
tion (64) holds.

A natural way to interpret Equation (68) is that the Fourier coeﬃcients an are Gaussian
random variables with mean zero and standard deviations σn = 1/(√2 Dn). Our derivation of
how to replace the potential V by an averaged potential W , goes through with little change.
The most important change is that the denominator n2 in Equation (21) has to be replaced
by n2 + ν2, and hence the correlation function fK is replaced by a function fK,ν which is still
periodic with period 1,

8 Numerical test results

Table 3 presents numerical results for the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom, for
13.598 eV. All results are for a temperature of 15 000 K.
comparison with the exact value of
The Monte Carlo method was used with a standard Metropolis algorithm. In each Monte
Carlo step, one point to be updated is chosen randomly among the 2K + 1 points on the
discrete path, then a random step is generated and either accepted or rejected depending on
the change in the discrete action, ∆SD. If ∆SD
¯h ln u,
with u a uniform random variable between 0 and 1, the step is rejected. The optimization
of the Monte Carlo strategy was not considered, but is of course an important problem. In
fact, the naive approach of updating one point at a time has a disastrously slow convergence
when more than about one hundred time steps are used.

0, the step is accepted. If ∆SD >

≤

−

The main computational cost of updating one point is computing the change in the Fourier
components, this takes approximately 2K +1 ﬂoating point operations. If more than one point
is updated in each step, one may choose e.g. 2K + 1 = 3n for some power n, and then use the
fast Fourier transform with base 3.

By far the highest statistics, 1010 MC steps, was run for the entry with 201 time steps. In
this case, statistical uncertainties are given in the table, and the values found for the ground
state energy are consistent with the exact value, within the uncertainties of less than one
per cent. A number of time steps of the order of 50 may give suﬃcient accuracy for many
purposes.

It is noteworthy that the statistical error in the direct estimate of the energy,

is half the separate errors in
closer to the exact energy than the estimate
by elimination of the kinetic energy.

It is crucial to have a good phenomenological model of electronic stopping power for modeling
the physics of ion implantation into crystalline silicon. In the spirit of the Brandt-Kitagawa eﬀective
charge theory, we develop a model for electronic stopping power for an ion, which can be factorized
into (i) a globally averaged eﬀective charge taking into account eﬀects of close and distant collisions
by target electrons with the ion, and (ii) a local charge density dependent electronic stopping power
for a proton. This phenomenological model is implemented into both molecular dynamics and Monte
Carlo simulations. There is only one free parameter in the model, namely, the one electron radius
r◦
s for unbound electrons. By ﬁne tuning this parameter, it is shown that the model can work
successfully for both boron and arsenic implants. We report that the results of the dopant proﬁle
simulation for both species are in excellent agreement with the experimental proﬁles measured by
secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) over a wide range of energies and with diﬀerent incident
directions. We point out that the model has wide applicability, for it captures the correct physics of
electronic stopping in ion implantation. This model also provides a good physically-based damping
mechanism for molecular dynamics simulations in the electronic stopping power regime, as evidenced
by the striking agreement of dopant proﬁles calculated in our molecular dynamics simulations with
the SIMS data.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ion implantation in semiconductors is an important technology in integrated circuit device fabrication1. A reliable
description of as-implanted proﬁles and the resulting damage is needed for technological development, such as device
design and modeling, as well as process optimization and control in the fabrication environment. For semiconductor
devices whose physical dimensions are of order of submicrons or smaller, low implant energies and reduction of thermal
processing are necessary, resulting in more prominent channeling eﬀects in the as-implanted proﬁles and less post-
implant diﬀusion. At these physical dimensions, it is essential to obtain the two- or three-dimensional details of the
ever shallower and more compact dopant and damage proﬁles for post-implant diﬀusion simulations.

Study of the energy loss of channeled particles has a long history2, for the channeling features can be used to elucidate
the energy-loss mechanisms. Earlier analytical treatments of the implant proﬁles based on moment distributions,
derived from the Lindhard-Scharﬀ-Schiott theory (LSS)3, preclude channeling because of the amorphous nature of
the targets assumed in the studies. Later, it was realized that, because of the channeling eﬀect, electronic stopping
power plays a much more signiﬁcant role in ion implantation into crystalline solids than otherwise would be deduced
from the application4 of the LSS theory to amorphous materials. It is especially true for heavy ion implants at low
energies, such as arsenic ions in the energy range below 700keV5,6. For implantation into silicon, most Monte Carlo
(MC) models are only concerned with boron implants, and have not modeled arsenic implants accurately with an
electronic stopping power model consistent with that used for boron7,8. As will be shown below, the phenomenological
model we developed for electronic stopping power can be implemented into a Monte Carlo simulation program for
both boron and arsenic implants in diﬀerent channels with equal success over a wide range of implant energies.

In addition to Monte Carlo simulations with the binary collision approximation (BCA)9, molecular dynamics (MD)
incorporating multiple-interactions via many-body potentials can also be used to simulate the behavior of energetic
ions in amorphous or crystalline silicon. This method is especially applicable at low energies, for which many-body, and
multiple interactions are increasingly important10. Although it is well known that the BCA is valid for high incident
energies (∼ 0.1keV up to ∼MeV, the upper limit is set by relativistic eﬀects), in a cascade, especially initiated by
a relatively low energy ion, the energy of the ions will decrease and eventually reach the lower validity limit of the
BCA at which many-body eﬀects become important9,10. For crsytals of high symmetry, the BCA can be modiﬁed to
account for simultaneous collisions in channels9,11, and MD results can provide good insight into how to successfully
modify the BCA in this situation. Moreover, MD results can be compared to BCA Monte Carlo simulations and used
to establish the low energy limits of the binary collision approximation.

An extremely important issue in deploying molecular dynamics to model collision processes in covalent and ionic
solids is how to incorporate energy transfer mechanisms between electrons and ions12. A good description of dynamical
processes in energetic collisions, such as initial displacement damage, relaxation processes, and the cooling phase as
the energy dissipates into the ambient medium, requires a theoretical framework that encompasses all interactions
between ion-ion, ion-electron, and their interaction with the thermal surroundings. Especially, it should capture
the nonequilibrium thermodynamic nature of these physical processes involving a wide range of energy scales, from
a low energy electron-phonon interaction regime to a high energy radiation damage regime.13–17. Traditional MD
simulations can capture the thermal behavior of an insulator. Since they do not take into account coupling between
the phonons and the conduction electron system, obviously, these simulations underestimate the heat-transfer rate
for noninsulating materials. In addition to lattice thermal conductivity, the issue of the conductivity due to electrons
must be addressed. Furthermore, a correct description of the electronic stopping power should be incorporated
into MD simulations for high energy implantation. For example, in sputtering processes by particle bombardment,
examination of MD simulations with and without inelastic electronic energy loss has established that, independent
of the ion’s mass or energy, the inelastic electronic energy losses by target atoms within the collision cascade have
greater inﬂuence on the ejected atom yield than the ion’s electronic losses18. This is in contrast to the belief that the
electronic loss mechanism is important only for cascades initiated by light ions or by heavy ions at high bombardment
energies18. Although a convincing experimental veriﬁcation of the electronic eﬀects in sputtering is still lacking, the
eﬀects should be relevant to defect production rates, defect mobility and annealing, etc.19,20. Also as shown in Ref.
21, traditional MD simulations produce extremely long channeling tails due to the absence of electronic stopping. In
order to incorporate the ion-electron interaction into molecular dynamics simulations, a simple scheme was proposed
by adding a phenomenological term, which describes the inelastic electronic stopping in the high energy radiation
damage regime, while also capturing the thermal conductivity by coupling low energy ions to a thermal reservoir22.
The empirical expression used in Ref. 22 for the strength of the ion-electron coupling is a function of the local
electronic density. At the low charge density limit, a density functional result was reproduced23, and at the high
charge density limit, the linear response results were captured. In the same spirit, we develop a stochastic MD model
incorporating the electronic stopping power as a damping mechanism. Our model is based on an eﬀective charge
theory24 with the electronic stopping power factorized into two parts. One is the eﬀective charge of the incident
ion, which is a globally averaged quantity determined by the average unbound electron density in the medium. The
other factor is the electronic stopping power for a proton, for which the same local density functional results are used.
Naturally, our damping mechanism incorporates both regimes, i.e., the electronic stopping regime and the electron-
phonon interaction regime, into our molecular dynamics simulation, because the inelastic loss for a proton exhibits
a similar density dependence as prescribed in Ref. 22, with additional modiﬁcations due to the velocity dependence
of the eﬀective charge. In the present work, however, we emphasize mainly the electron stopping power in the high
energy regime (∼ keV to ∼100keV), i.e., the electrons behave as an energy sink. The validity of the model for the
electronic heat conduction regime will be discussed elsewhere. In the following, for boron and arsenic implants into
single-crystal silicon in both the channeling and oﬀ-axis directions, we will show that a classical MD with the physically-
based damping mechanism can generate dopant proﬁles in excellent agreement with experimentally-measured proﬁles
obtained by secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).

As discussed above, the phenomenological model we have developed for electronic stopping power is successfully
implemented into both BCA Monte Carlo programs and MD simulations. Wide applicability requires that a model
be valid for diﬀerent implant species over a wide range of energies. We emphasize that this electronic stopping model
is accurate both for boron and arsenic implants, thus providing a crucial test of the generality and validity of the
model in capturing the correct physics of electronic stopping.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the phenomenological model for electronic stopping power
in detail. Atomic units e = ¯h = me = 1 are used throughout the paper unless otherwise speciﬁed.
In Sec. III,
we brieﬂy discuss diﬀerent electronic stopping models implemented on the versatile BCA Monte Carlo simulation
platform, MARLOWE9,10. Then the results of the BCA Monte Carlo simulations on a rare-event algorithm enhanced
UT-MARLOWE platform25 with our electronic stopping model are summarized. In Sec. IV, the results of the MD
with the inelastic electronic energy loss are presented. In Sec. V, we make closing remarks and point out directions
for future studies.

According to the Brandt-Kitagawa (BK) theory24, the electronic stopping power of an ion can be factorized into
two components based on an eﬀective charge scaling argument. One is the eﬀective charge of the ion (if not fully
ionized), Z ∗
1 , which is in general a function of ion velocity v and the charge density of the target ρ, or equivalently,

the one electron radius rs = [3/(4πρ(x))]1/3; the other is the electronic stopping power for a proton, Sp(v, rs). In the
local density approximation, therefore, the total inelastic energy loss ∆Ee of an ion of constant velocity v is

where the integral is along the ion path. Since the eﬀective charge is a continuous function of electronic density,
mathematically, it is always possible to ﬁnd a mean value, r◦

s of rs, such that Eq. (1) can be rewritten as

If the eﬀective charge is a slowly varying function of space, physically, this means that r◦
s describes an average number
of unbound electrons in the sea and thus can be assumed to determine the Fermi surface. Therefore, we have the
relation between the Fermi velocity and r◦
s :

where α = [4/(9π)]1/3. We note that this r◦
model.

s will be the only tunable parameter in our electronic stopping power

Next we turn to a simple statistical model for this partially ionized, moving projectile. For an ion with N = Z1 − Q
bound electrons, where Q is the charge number of the ion of atomic number Z1, a radially symmetric charge density

is used in the BK theory. Here Λ is the ion size parameter, a function of the fractional ionization, q = (Z1−N )/Z1. The
total energy of the electrons comes from the sum of the kinetic energy estimated by the local density approximation,
the electron-electron interaction in the Hartree approximation weighted by a variational parameter λ to account for
correlation, and the Coulomb energy of the electrons in the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus. A variational approach
minimizing the total energy leads to the following dependence of the ion size on the ionization fraction q:

where a0 = 0.24005. In the BK theory, the generalized Lindhard theory of the electronic stopping in a homogeneous
electron gas with an electron density n = 3/(4π¯r3
s) is used. The total electronic stopping is estimated from the sum
of the energy loss in soft, distant collisions, i.e., small momentum transfers with target electrons seeing a charge
qZ1, and the energy loss to the target electrons experiencing increased nuclear interaction in hard, close collisions
corresponding to large momentum transfers. As extensively discussed in the literature (see, e.g., Ref. 24,26,27, and
references therein), it is assumed that the charge state of a proton in a solid is unity. Given an ionization fraction
q and using the scaling argument for the ratio of ion stopping to the proton stopping at the same velocity, the BK
theory produces a simple expression for the fractional eﬀective charge of an ion24,27

where C(¯rs) is weakly dependent on the target and has a numerical value of about 1/2. We will set C = 0.5 below.
Then, the eﬀective charge is

s . Therefore, the eﬀective charge Z ∗

For our model, using the procedure (2) outlined above, this dependence of ¯rs is identiﬁed with the dependence of the
mean value r◦
1 has a nonlocal, i.e., spatially independent, character and depends on
the Fermi surface. In the above discussion, as can be seen, q is a parameter which is not ﬁxed by the BK theory. For
obtaining this ionization fraction, there are velocity and energy criteria originally proposed by Bohr28 and Lamb29,
respectively. Kitagawa also used a statistical argument to justify scaling analyses in terms of the scaling parameter
v1/(vBZ 2/3
)30. Recently, the issue of which stripping criterion can give rise to a better physical understanding has
been raised31. However, in light of the large amount of experimental data employed in Ref. 27 to extract an ionization

scaling consistent with the Brandt-Kitagawa theory, we will use this empirically veriﬁed scaling in our model. As
summarized in Ref. 27, a new criterion in the BK approach is proposed24,26, i.e., a relative velocity criterion, which
assumes that the electrons of the ion which have an orbital velocity lower than the relative velocity between the ion
and the electrons in the medium are stripped oﬀ. The relative velocity vr is obtained by averaging over the diﬀerence
between the ion velocity v1 and the electron velocity ve under the assumption that the conduction electrons are a free
electron gas in the ground state, therefore, whose velocity distribution is isotropic. Performing a further averaging of
ve over the Fermi sphere leads to26

For the ionization scaling, a form of the Northcliﬀe type32 is then assumed for the scaling variable, i.e., the reduced
relative velocity:

where vB is the Bohr velocity and vB = 1 in our units. The extensive experimental data for ions 3 ≤ Z1 ≤ 92 are
used in Ref. 27 to determine

In Ref. 27, an ionization scaling ﬁt with even tighter bunching of the experimental data along the ﬁt is presented.
However, this approach entails a much more involved computational procedure27. The accuracy level of Eq. (11) is
adequate for our present purposes.

In our model, the electronic stopping power for a proton is derived from a nonlinear density-functional formalism23.
In the linear response theory, the energy loss per unit path length of a proton moving at velocity v in the electron
gas is obtained by Ritchie33

using an approximation to the full random-phase approximation dielectric function, which amounts to the exponential
screening potential around the ion induced by density ﬂuctuations of the electrons. The nonlinear, density-functional
calculation based on the formalism of Hohenberg and Kohn, and Kohn and Sham34,35 has been performed23,36,37 to
obtain the charge density and scattering phase shifts for the conduction band as a function of energy self-consistently.

stopping powers. In our implementation, the result of the nonlinear, density functional formalism for the electronic

towards values suﬃciently small compared to unity23, this requires that the correction factor smoothly tend to unity
as rs → 0. Obviously, the above G(rs) possesses the correct convergence property.

The last ingredient needed for our model is the charge distribution ρ(x) for silicon atoms in the crystal. We
use the solid-state Hartree-Fock atomic charge distribution27, which is spherically symmetric due to the muﬃn-tin
construction. In this approximation, there is about one electron charge unit (0.798 electrons for Si) left outside the
muﬃn-tin. This small amount of charge can be either distributed in the volume between the spherical atoms, resulting
3
in an interstitial background charge density 0.119e/˚A
, or distributed between the maximal collision distance used in
Monte Carlo simulations and the muﬃn-tin radius (see details below).

III. BCA MONTE CARLO SIMULATION RESULTS

First, in comparison with other electronic stopping models used in Monte Carlo simulations based on the MAR-
LOWE platform, we stress that in our model the eﬀective charge is a nonlocal quantity, neither explicitly dependent
on the impact parameter nor on the charge distribution, and the stopping power for a proton depends on the local
charge density of the solid. A purely nonlocal version of the BK theory was implemented into MARLOWE42, in
which both the eﬀective charge and the stopping power for a proton depend on a single nonlocal parameter, namely,
the averaged one electron radius. Its results demonstrated that energy loss for well-channeled ions in the keV region
has high sensitivity to the one-electron radius in the channel. It was pointed out that a correct density distribution
is needed to account for the electronic stopping in the channel8,42. Later, a purely local version of the BK theory
was developed to take into account the charge distribution of the electrons43,44. Comparison with other electronic
stopping models, such as Lindhard and Scharﬀ4, Firsov45, and the above nonlocal implementation42, showed a marked
improvement in modeling electronic stopping in the channel7,43,44. Good agreement between simulated dopant proﬁles
and the SIMS proﬁles for boron implants into h100i single crystal silicon was obtained. However, this purely local
implementation of the BK theory did not successfully model the electronic stopping for the boron implants into the
h110i axial channel and arsenic implants as noted in Ref. 7.

In the present work, UT-MARLOWE25 was selected as the platform for our electronic stopping model implemen-
tation. UT-MARLOWE is an extension of the MARLOWE code for simulating the behavior of energetic ions in
crystalline materials9,10. It has been enhanced with: (i) atomic pair-speciﬁc interatomic potentials for B-Si, B-O,
As-Si, As-O for nuclear stoppings27, (ii) variance reduction algorithm implemented for rare events, (iii) important
implant parameters accounted for, e.g., tilt and rotation angles, the thickness of the native oxide layers, beam diver-
gence, and wafer temperature, etc. In our simulations, we have turned oﬀ certain options, such as the cumulative
damage model in the UT-MARLOWE code, which is a phenomenological model to estimate defect production and
recombination rates. Individual ion trajectories were simulated under the BCA and the overlapping of the damage
caused by diﬀerent individual cascades was neglected. In order to test the electronic stopping model we also used low
dose (1013/cm2) implants so that cummulative damage eﬀects do not signiﬁcantly complicate dopant proﬁles7. Also,
for the simulation results we report below, 16˚A native oxide surface layer, 300K wafer temperature were used. The
maximum distance for searching a collision partner is 0.35 lattice constant, the default value in the UT-MARLOWE5.
The excess charge outside the muﬃn-tins is distributed in the space between this maximum collision distance and the
muﬃn-tin radius. In the simulation, the electronic stopping power is evaluated continuously along the path the ion
traverses through regions of varying charge density, i.e., the energy loss is given by

∆Ee =

[Z1γ(v1, r◦

s )]2Sp(v1, rs(x))dx.

In the simulations, the free parameter r◦

s was adjusted to yield the best results in overall comparison with the

experimental data. The value r◦
directions. This value is physically reasonable for silicon. Note that the unbound electronic density in silicon with
only valence electrons taken into account will give rise to a value of 1.061˚A for rs. The fact that our r◦
s value is greater
than 1.061˚A indicates that not all valence electrons participate in stopping the ion as unbound electrons.

We display the Monte Carlo dopant proﬁle simulation results as follows. We note in passing that the lower and
upper limits of energy used in our simulations are determined by the energy range of the SIMS data available to us.
In Figs. 1, 2 and 3, we show boron dopant proﬁles for the energies 15keV, 35keV, and 80 keV along h100i, h110i, and
the oﬀ-axis direction with tilt = 7◦ and rotation = 30◦, respectively. It can be seen that the overall agreement with
the SIMS data is excellent. In Fig. 1, the simulations show a good ﬁt for the cutoﬀ range. In the high energy regime,
the simulated distribution shows a slightly peaked structure. This can be attributed to a strong channeling due to
insuﬃcient scatterings in the implants. We have noticed that by increasing, e.g., the native oxide layer thickness, the
peak can be reduced. For the h110i channeling case, the distribution indicates a possibility that the total electronic

5

stopping power along the channel is a little too strong at the high energy end. However, it should be kept in mind that
for this channel, the UT-MARLOWE model becomes sensitive to the multiple collision parameter which is employed
as an approximate numerical correction for the eﬀect of multiple overlapping nuclear encounters. It is not clear how
to separate the contributions from these two diﬀerent sources.

For comparison, in Fig. 4, we also display a low energy (5keV) implant case46. Again the agreement for both
the channeling and oﬀ-axis directions is striking (thin lines without symbols). In order to illustrate the importance
of electronic stopping power at this low energy for boron implants, we have used an artiﬁcially reduced electronic
stopping power, i.e, multiplying ∆Ee in Eq. (16) by a factor of 1/10 in the simulation, to genearte dopant proﬁles in
the channeling and oﬀ-axis directions. From Fig. 4, evidently, it can be concluded that, for boron implants even in this
low energy regime, electronic stopping power has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the channeled tail of the dopant distribution
and on the cutoﬀ range for both channeling and oﬀ-axis directions.

Figs. 5 and 6 show arsenic dopant proﬁles for energies ranging from 15keV to 180 keV along h100i, and the oﬀ-axis
direction with tilt = 8◦ and rotation = 30◦, respectively. It can readily be concluded that our electronic model works
successfully with arsenic as well as boron implants into crystalline silicon. For comparison, a case of arsenic implant
into amorphous silicon is also shown in Fig. 7. The implant energy is 180keV. The eﬀect of electronic stopping, which
shows clearly in the long sloping channeling tail in the crystalline counterpart (see Fig. 5), is less prominent for the
amorphous case (Fig. 7).

To examine the role that electronic stopping power has on arsenic implants in the low energy regime (∼ 5keV), we
again simulated arsenic dopant proﬁles with the artiﬁcially reduced electronic stopping power. For these low energy
implants, the oxide layer thickness 3˚A were used in the BCA simulations on account of the fact that the wafers used
for these implants were treated by dilute HF etch for 30 seconds, then implanted within 2 hours to prevent native oxide
regrowth47. In Fig. 8, we show that our electronic stopping power model is successful in both the h100i channeling
and oﬀ-axis directions (thin lines without symbols). Clearly, the artiﬁcial reduction of electronic stopping power
leads to incorrect dopant distributions and cutoﬀ ranges for both the channeling and oﬀ-axis directions, although the
deviations indicate a less signiﬁcant contribution from electronic stopping for arsenic implants than for boron implants
at the energy 5keV. However, the deviation in the cutoﬀ range due to the electronic stopping power reduction for the
channeling case is still signiﬁcant. Obviously, this reinforces the conclusion that, for channeling implants even at low
energies, electronic stopping is not negligible.

In summary, the above results demonstrate clearly that our electronic stopping power indeed captures the correct

physics of the electronic stopping for ion implants into silicon over a wide range of implant energies.

IV. MD SIMULATION RESULTS

We have also used classical molecular dynamics simulation to study the electronic stopping power as one of the
damping mechanisms in the high energy regime, as discussed above. Here we demonstrate that experimental data,
such as SIMS, can be used to test the validity of this physically-based damping model. The interaction between silicon
atoms are modeled by Tersoﬀ’s empirical potential48:

E =

f (rij ) [VR(rij ) − bijVA(rij )] ,

(17)

1
2

Xi6=j

where f (rij) is a cutoﬀ function that restricts interactions to nearest neighbors, VR(rij ) and VA(rij ) are pair terms, and
bij is a many-body function that can be regarded as an eﬀective Pauling bond order. We have modiﬁed the repulsive
part of the Tersoﬀ potential by splinning to the ZBL universal potential at close-range.27. The ZBL universal potential
is also used to model the ion-silicon interactions. In our full MD simulations for the low dose implantation, the lattice
temperature was initialized to 300K and the above electronic stopping model was applied to all the atoms. The only
modiﬁcation required for implementation in MD is to take into account the contributions from multiple silicon atoms
to the local electron density, while ensuring that the background electron density is only counted once. For each
individual cascade, all recoils and the accumulation of damage in the ion path are taken into account. Using the
parameter value 1.109 for r◦
s from the comparison of BCA Monte Carlo simulation results with the SIMS data, we
have simulated the implantation of low energy boron and arsenic ions into the Si {100}(2 × 1) surface at energies
between 0.5keV and 5keV, with both channeling and oﬀ-axis directions of incidence. We mention here that, for the
h100i channeling case up to 0.16 keV (32%) of 0.5 keV boron implant energy and 0.64 keV (13%) of 5keV arsenic
implant energy are lost via electronic stopping in our simulations. Simulations were terminated when the total
energy of the ion became less than 5eV, giving typical simulation times of around 0.2ps. Figs. 9, 10 and 11 show
the calculated dopant concentration proﬁle for various energies and directions. Each MD proﬁle is generated by a
set of between 500 and 1300 individual ion trajectories. Also shown are the proﬁles obtained using the modiﬁed

6

UT-MARLOWE BCA code described in Sec. III. Obviously, the MD calculation results are in very good agreement
with the experimental data, and with the BCA results. This demonstrates that our electronic stopping power model
provides a good physically-based damping mechanism for MD simulations of ion implantation.

V. CONCLUSION

We have developed a phenomenological electronic stopping power model for the physics of ion implantation. It has
been implemented into MD and BCA Monte Carlo simulations. SIMS data have been used to verify this model in
the MD and BCA Monte Carlo platforms. This model has only one free parameter, namely, the one electron radius
of unbound electrons in the medium. We have ﬁne tuned this parameter to obtain excellent results of dopant proﬁles
compared with SIMS data in both MD and BCA Monte Carlo simulations. We emphasize that this model with a
single parameter can equally successfully model both boron and arsenic implants into silicon over a wide range of
energies and in diﬀerent channeling and oﬀ-axis directions of incidence. This versatility indicates wide applicability of
the model in studies of other physical processes involving electronic stopping. As a more stringent test of the model,
it should also be applied to implantation of species other than boron and arsenic. Using arsenic implantation as an
example, we have also addressed the issue of how signiﬁcant electronic stopping is for heavy ions in a low energy
regime. For instance, to achieve a good quantitative understanding, we still have to take into account the physics of
electronic stopping for arsenic implants at 5keV.

As discussed above, it is important to incorporate ion-electron couplings into MD simulations in both the high energy
radiation damage regime and the low energy electron-phonon interaction regime. We have demonstrated that this
model provides a crucial piece of physics in MD simulations for modeling energetic collisions in the electronic stopping
power regime. The agreement of the simulated dopant proﬁles with the SIMS data shows that the incorporation
of this physically-based damping term into MD simulations is a phenomenologically reliable approach in the regime
concerned. Under way is an investigation of whether it can be used as a good phenomenological model for electron-
phonon coupling in the low energy regime. This agreement also suggests that MD can be used to generate dopant
proﬁles for testing against the low energy BCA results when experimental data is not available. Furthermore, MD
simulations incorporating this physically-based damping mechanism can provide valuable insight into how to modify
the binary collision approximation. This will enable the validity of the Monte Carlo simulation to be extended
further into the lower energy regime, while not destroying computational eﬃciency required in realistic simulation
environments.

We thank Al Tasch for useful discussions and for providing us with SIMS data, which facilitate validation of the

model. This work is performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy.

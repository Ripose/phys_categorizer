This paper is concerned with classes of models of stochastic reaction dynamics with time-scales separation.

We demonstrate that the existence of the time-scale separation naturally leads to the application of the averaging

principle and elimination of degrees of freedom via the renormalization of transition rates of slow reactions.

The method suggested in this work is more general than other approaches presented previously: it is not limited

to a particular type of stochastic processes and can be applied to different types of processes describing fast

dynamics, and also provides crossover to the case when separation of time scales is not well pronounced. We

derive a family of exact ﬂuctuation-dissipation relations which establish the connection between effective rates

and the statistics of the reaction events in fast reaction channels. An illustration of the technique is provided.

Examples show that renormalized transition rates exhibit in general non-exponential relaxation behavior with a

broad range of possible scenarios.

I. INTRODUCTION

Chemical reaction networks are systems of molecular species of different types interacting with

each other by means of multiple reactions [1]. In classical chemical systems, the volume of the

reactor and population numbers of species of each types are usually large giving the accurate de-

scription of the system in terms of the concentrations. Reactors with complex chemistry give rise

to complicated systems of nonlinear equations for the concentrations of chemical species that do

not lend themselves to analytic solution. Dynamics of these quantities can be modeled via sets

of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which are powerful tools for predicting the dynamical

behavior of macroscopic chemical mixtures.

2

There is a recent renewal of interest in stochastic modeling of chemical systems which came with

the recent realization of importance of noise in cellular information processing. At the level of a

single cell, number of molecules involved in some processes can be very small and concentrations

are described as nano-molar [2, 3]. In addition to that, different processes are also characterized by

signiﬁcantly different times scales [4].

Presence of this time-scale separation and highly different copy numbers of molecular species

usually complicates the study of biological processes with computer simulations. There is an obvi-

ous need for computationally tractable stochastic models on a macro-scale that can provide insights

into joint, qualitative, effects arising from interaction of several sub-networks. In deterministic sys-

tems of ordinary differential equations, time-scale separation is usually related to the concept of

stiffness. It is obviously hard to deﬁne the same concept in case of the stochastic systems [5].

In spite of these obvious complications some progress has been made in modeling of biochemical

networks which express the separation of time-scales. One difﬁculty is heterogeneity of simulation

techniques used for simulation of ODEs/SDEs and stochastic simulation algorithm. One strategy

exploited in the literature [5, 6] is based on grouping together of reaction events taking place in a

single reaction channel in a fast succession and applying diffusion approximation [7]. In [8] Rao

et.al. discuss a computational approach for performing elimination of the fast species based on rapid

equilibrium in the limit of the inﬁnite time-scale separation. This method was termed quasi-steady

state approximation (QSSA). A somewhat similar approach is taken in [9]. Formally, this method

stems from the classical deterministic QSSA applied to the chemical master equation itself rather

then to the (stochastic) differential equation underlying the dynamics of the state vector (numbers

of molecular species). The method developed by Cao et al. in [10] can be viewed as generalization

of approach of Rao et.al. [8] but still have the limitations of being derived through the application

of deterministic techniques and assumptions to the chemical master equation. It also assumes that

averaging procedure can be done by solving the system of algebraic equations for the expectations

of the fast variables given slow, termed in [10] as a virtual fast process. We note here that studies of

stochastic dynamics of diffusion-type processes evolving on different time scales were pioneered

by Bogolubov, Khasminski and Freidlin and we refer the reader to monographs [11, 12, 13].

This paper has two purposes. First, we present the formulation of stochastic reaction dynamics of

3

reaction network consisting of two subnetworks. Compared to many previous results, where usual

description of stochastic reaction dynamics follows the approach based on chemical master equation

(CME), current publication follows the path-sampling approach and represents the dynamics as a

jump-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs).

Second purpose is to provide rigorous procedure for the renormalization of the transition rates of

slow reactions in the presence of fast ones. Following the picture of the stochastic dynamics devel-

oped in the ﬁrst part of this paper, we outline the main guidelines for use of stochastic averaging

principle including error control analysis. Despite of the recent rebirth of interest to the method of

stochastic averaging in applications to stochastic chemical kinetics, very few examples deal with

situations when this procedure might break down. We demonstrate here, in a constructive way,

how to perform the averaging over fast reaction events and how to obtain the effective slow-scale

transition rate.

Organization of this paper is as follows. In the next section we discuss the general probabilistic

framework for stochastic dynamics of reaction networks and introduce a scheme for the partition of

species and reactions. In Section III we investigate the consequences of possible time-scales sepa-

ration and present a procedure based on renormalization of transition rates. We also put emphasis

on error analysis, outlining main sources of the numerical error on different steps of the procedure.

Our paper will end with discussion of examples.

II. NETWORK PARTITIONING

We begin our discussion with a general set-up, introducing basic concepts and notation.

Assume that a well mixed, isothermal system has S different molecular species indexed by

i = 1 . . . S and there are R reaction channels, index by r = 1 . . . R, transforming the molecualr

composition of these species. For the basic notation and examples we direct reader to [14, 15].

State vector of the system can be represented as following:

(X, Z)

(1)

where ﬁst part of the state vector Xi

Z+, i = 1 . . . SX represents main species while the second

∈

part Zi

Z+, i = 1 . . . Sz represents intermidiate species Zi, i = 1 . . . SZ . Total number of

∈

(2b)

(2c)

all types of species: SX + SZ = S. Vectors νX

r , νZ

r and νXZ

r

are stoichiometric changes of

components X and Z if reaction event r takes place. We will not make any assumptions about

actual number of molecular species of each type, i.e. we will not assume low or large copy numbers.

We assume, however, that there are three subsets of reactions in the system:

(i) reactions which transform only species X (we denote this subset

R1),

(ii) reactions which transform only species Z (subset

R2)
(iii) ”linker” reactions which mix species X and Z (subset

R3).

Each reaction channel can be speciﬁed by the transition rates ar (a positive function) which

describes the probability ardt of reaction event to take place in the interval of time dt. Transition

rate ar can be further speciﬁed as positive functions of X, Z, or,in general, on both components X

and Z. Based on the deﬁnition of subsets

R1,2,3 we have:

ar(Z),

·

represents the number of reactive conﬁgurations available at a given state X, Z [14].

There exist different methods to characterize the stochastic chemical dynamics. One of the most

popular approach is to provide an equation for the joint probability density pt(X, Z), which gives

all information about instantaneous state of the system at generic moment of time t. Such equation

is known as chemical master equation (CME) [14, 16] and it has been intensively described and

utilized in recent literature [8, 9, 10]. But even if we can obtain [17] the solution of CME, which

is usually a very hard problem even for simple chemical networks, this approach still have certain

limitations, coming from instantaneous description provided by the density pt(

To describe the stochastic dynamics of the chemical network one can introduce the set of inde-

pendent point processes Nr(t), Nr(0) = 0 representing the numbers of reaction events which took

describe the composition change of the system due to the reaction

during the small time interval [t, t + δt) are proportional to the transition rates (2):

E(Nr(t + δt)

Xt, Z t) = ar(Xt, Z t)δt + O(δt2)
Nr(t)

−

Processes Nr(t) can be considered as time-changed, unit-rate independent Poisson processes

Πr(t) [7]:

Thus, the large class of discrete event systems with totally inaccessible event times can be viewed

as a standard Poisson process with appropriate change of the time scale:

Nr(t) = Πr(

ar(Xt′, Z t′)dt′)

t

Z

t

t

7→ Z

0

ar(Xt′, Z t′)dt′

The time change generates path-dependent or self-affecting point processes whose dynamics de-

pend on the information generated by the arrivals of the process (Xt, Z t) . It is important to take

into account that the stochastic differential equation does not only introduce the probability distri-

bution for the pair (X, Z) but also generates a measure on the paths, which contains much more

information. For almost any realization of the set of 1 . . . R standard Poisson processes, Πr(t, ω),

parametrized by the element ω of event space [7, 18] and any deterministic initial condition the

solution (X(t, ω), Z(t, ω)) is a step-wise stochastic process.

Note also, that dynamics of each component X or Z is non-Markovian if considered separately

but the dynamics of the pair (X, Z) is Markovian.

So far we have introduced only the basic notation: quite generic system of SDEs given by (3)

outlined in this section have not invoked any assumptions on particular relations between different

transition rates ar and was totally based on prior information about existence of two groups of

6

species, i.e. Xi and Zi which uniquely identiﬁed the partition of the reactions into the subsets

R1,

R2 and
In the next section we consider the particular implication of time-scale separation including the

extensions of the stochastic averaging principle and diffusion approximation.

III. SEPARATION OF TIME-SCALES AND ELIMINATION OF FAST

STOCHASTIC VARIABLES.

In many situations, dynamics of main species X is propagated via large number of fast transitions

which transform mainly intermediate species Z. One usually desires to construct an approximate,

time coarse-grained model, which involve only main species. It is important that approximate prob-

lem describes the dynamics of the system on a large time scale and thus is more advantageous for

performing simulations without signiﬁcant sacriﬁce in accuracy. This section deals with substitu-

tion of the original problem with approximate one and demonstrates the form convergence of the

approximation under certain assumptions.

We assume that at certain region of state space the following assumption can be made about

type are challenge for direct application of Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) [15, 19] because

they will require the time steps of the order O(ǫ) with a total computational cost of order ǫ−1. If

we want to advance through the time interval [0, t], t

O(1) most of the simulation time will be

It is instructive to consider a simple reaction scheme involving three species X1, Z1,2 similar to

Presence of the scaling factor ǫ−1 in reaction constants k1,2ǫ−1 allows us to consider family

of solutions parameterized by ǫ. We expect Z1,2 to follow adiabatically the X1t. To make that

apparent, one can apply the functional law of large numbers to the processes N2,3(t) in time interval

This means that variables Z1t and Z2t reach a stationary binomial distribution:

and eliminate fast variables Z1,2 from the description even though the total number of molecules

Z1 + Z2 may be not a large quantity. Thus, taking f (
·
∈ R3 one obtains averaged transition rates ¯ar(X) which now depend only on the
slow variable X. Results of the large deviation theory [11] demonstrate weak convergence bounds

of the original problem with small but non-zero ǫ to the solution of the averaged system. But as we

mentioned it before, one of the goals of this publication is to analyze and extend averaging process

to the situation when ǫ may be small, but not ’inﬁnitesimally’ small. In the next section III A we

will try to answer this question.

Equations 18a constitute one of the main results of the paper. In the ﬁeld of chemical kinetics a

similar methodology is known under the label of the ”rate dependent processes with dynamical dis-

order” [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] where it describes the inﬂuence of the non-equilibrium environmen-

tal degrees of freedom on transport and kinetic properties. Similar approach was used to describe

quantum dynamics in ﬂuctuating environment [27]. Using the procedure of the cumulant expansion

[16, 28] we can obtain the following interrelationship between ¯ar and the multi-point cumulants

Renormalized transition rates ¯ar(t, X) provide so-called semi-Markov approximation [16, 20].

Term ”semi-Markov” generally describes non-Markov processes since the statistical properties of

the waiting times can not be provided only by average rate of the process but all the multi-time

joint probability distributions for the considered process must be considered. Note that in our case

effective rate ¯ar depend on the statistics of ﬂuctuations of fast variables Z through the cumulants

There is a general Jensen inequality , which gives the relationship between the mean value of a

Application of this inequality leads to the important conclusion that mean ﬁeld rate (21) is larger

then the rate given by (19). The exponential and non-exponential structure of the averaged survival

probability is governed by the hierarchy of the time scales of the dynamics of Zt at different values

of X. If dynamics of Z is complicated and exhibit metastability at some values of X then Marko-

vian approximation 21 is no longer holds and additional corrections corresponding to the high order

cumulants must be taken into consideration. Correction to the Markovian approximation based on

the second order cumulants is:

Correction to the Markovian approximation given by (24a) is exact for the Gaussian and Markov

process since the only possible expression for the correlation function of a stationary Markov and

Gaussian process is the exponential of a form (25). It is also interesting to note that correlation

correction (24a) generally decreases the transition rate. This is a result which can not be obtained

using only straightforward averaging method presented in publications [8, 10].

Note that in general relations (18a) can be viewed as a type of ﬂuctuation-dissipation relations;

they connect the effective dissipation rate in the slow coarse-grained dynamics and statistics of
ﬂuctuations of the fast reaction events given by the cumulants C (m)

IV. COARSE-GRAINED DYNAMICS AND ERROR CONTROL

Given the renormalized survival probabilities and transition rates at different points of state space

of main species X:

stochastic dynamics of the main species X can be formulated in the straightforward way, similar to

the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) [14, 15]. At the time point t = 0 state X0 we consider

an overall survival probability:

¯ar(t, X) = ar(X),

r

S(t

X0) =

and deﬁne a jump moment of the slow process as a ﬁrst time τ1 when S(t

X0) crosses the value u,

where the last one is a random number uniformly distributed on the interval (0, 1) [29]:

Post-jump transition kernel is deﬁned by the vector of transition probabilities

i.e. reaction event r∗

Xτ1 = X0 + νr∗,

Then the same procedure is performed starting at the state Xτ1 with generation of the interval τ2

Question about the overall accuracy and the error control is a delicate question. Below we de-

compose the overall error of the method it into the following main factors:

Below we discuss step by step leading terms in e1, e2.

Estimation of the error e1 is related to the answer on the following question: what possible error

is introduced while performing averaging of rates of reactions in the subsets

R1,3 at ﬁxed X?

It is not hard to see that this error is proportional to the probability of the event that minimal jump

time over the reactions in group

Error e2 depends on the number of cumulants we have included in Eqn. (19) and cumulant of

calculation of the renormalized survival probability based on eigenvalue decomposition of certain

linear operator which is a practical approach in situations when state space of the variable Z is not

very large.

We now present a simple intuitive example to show that exponential or non-exponential structure

of the averaged survival probability is governed by the relationship between time-scales of ”fast”

and ”slow” species. Assume that for some reaction channel

rate ar(X, Z) = krhr(X)h′

r(Z) jumps reversibly between two values ar(X, 0) and ar(X, 1) with

the stochastic dynamics of Zt governed by simple master equation:

This result is very similar in nature to the result obtained in [23] for the case of identical transition

rates. Remarkable and simple result outlined by Eqn. (33) allows us to capture in essence regimes

corresponding to the different ratios of the time-scales: ar

Interesting case of non-exponential relaxation kinetics, and speciﬁcally non-exponential kinetics

similar to the previous example. One can see that this relaxation process shows non-exponential

time dependence at small times due to the fact that process Zt rarely visits the states contributing

to the maximum of the relaxation rate given by Eqn. (36). We investigate the dependence of the

averages survival probability on the level of activation threshold X and value of the equilibrium

constant Keq. Results presented on the Fig. 5 show non-exponential behavior of averaged survival

probability for the system at small times t. It is evident that non-exponential behavior of Sr(t

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

15

Let us summarize the main aspects of this paper. We have studied reduction approach to elimi-

nate a fast intermediate in the chemical reaction network. To develop this method it is important to

consider the time coarse-grained transition rates. We have discussed the limitations of the principle

of stochastic averaging and its possible extensions through the rigorous technique for construction

of the effective transition rates. We outline the procedure for re-normalization of the transition rates

and construction of the effective Markov chain for the slow reactions. The merit of the present ap-

proach is that it is based on a conceptually transparent probabilistic approach involving the waiting-

time distribution.Technique itself resembles a non-Markovian generalization of the Kubo-Anderson

theory of stochastic modulation. Our study clearly indicates importance of details of the statistical

structure of averaging process.

Abstract In previous works it was shown that the 3 × N -dimensional conformational space
of a molecular system could be divided into a number of cells, and from data sampled from
molecular dynamics simulations it was possible to build a structure: the graph of cells, encoding
the set of cells in conformational space that the system visits in its thermal wandering. Here
we describe a set of procedures for extracting useful information from this huge structure: 1st)
interesting regions in the volume occupied by the system in conformational space can be bounded
by a polyhedral cone whose faces are determined empirically from a set of relations between the
coordinates of the molecule, 2nd) it is also shown that this cone can be split into a hierarchical set
of smaller cones, 3rd) extracting sets of inter-atomic distances from the graph of cells is equivalent
to ﬁnding maximal cliques in a graph.

I. The basic construction

It was shown in a series of papers [1-4] that the conformational space of a molecule of N+1 atoms
R3×N (thereafter referred as CS)1 could be described to a fair degree of accuracy by means of
the partition generated by a set of hyperplanes passing through the origin that form a Coxeter
reﬂection arrangement2 denominated AN [5,6], moreover the reﬂections form a symmetry group
that is isomorphic to the symmetric group.

In our description of CS we have three independent arrangements one for each coordinate (x, y, z),
i.e. A3×N = AN × AN × AN , that generate three partitions of R3×N , each dividing RN into a
hierarchical set of regions shaped as polyhedral cones denominated cells. The hyperplanes in
our partition are deﬁned as

Hij : xi−xj = 0

,

1 ≤ i < j ≤ N +1

(1)

1N +1 is because the translation symmetry makes one dimension spurious [1,4].
2That a reﬂexion through one of the hyperplanes leaves the arrangement unchanged.

1

each Hij divides RN into three regions :

xi < xj

, xi = xj

and xi > xj

(2)

in the ﬁrst case we say that xj dominates xi, in the second case neither xi nor xj dominates,
in the last case xi dominates xj. As cells are bounded by the hyperplanes (1) a consequence of
(2) is that the points inside a given cell (in x, y or z) have the following property:

xi1 ≤ xi2 ≤ xi3 ≤ ... ≤ xiN−2 ≤ xiN−1 ≤ xiN

(3)

where the sequence (i1, i2, i3, ...iN−2, iN−1, iN ) is a permutation of the set ZN+1 = (1, 2, 3, ... N −
1, N, N +1), reﬂecting a point through Hij is equivalent to permute the coordinates i and j [6].
Thus a cell where a strict ”less than” relation holds for every pair of coordinates in (3) is encoded
by the dominance sequence

(i1)(i2)(i3)...(iN−2)(iN−1)(iN )

(4a)

while for a cell where xiα = xiα+1 = ... = xiα+r , for r+1 consecutive indices (iα, iα+1, ...iα+r) in (3)
will be encoded by the dominance sequence

(i1)(i2)(i3)...(iαiα+1...iα+r)...(iN−1)(iN )(iN+1)

(4b)

the ﬁrst (4a) represents an N -dimensional cell while (4b) is a (N −r)-dimensional cell because it
corresponds to the intersection of the hyperplanes Hij with i, j ∈ (iαiα+1...iα+r).

Deﬁnition 1. The position of a coordinate ci in a cell of dimension N is the position of index
i in the dominance sequence.

An alternative encoding of cells is by means of an N ×N antisymmetric sign matrix S c, where c
stands for x, y or z.

For S c:
coordinates are deﬁned:

let 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N + 1, then for an arbitrary point p the matrix elements for the c

i < pc
j
i = pc
j
i > pc
j

S c
ij = − if pc
ij = 0 if pc
S c
ij = + if pc
S c
It was explained in [1,5] that as a direct consequence of (3) S c can be interpreted as the incidence
matrix of a digraph with no directed cycles, and that the cell encodings (3) and (5) can be readily
interconverted into one another

(5)

Theorem 1. Contiguous cells in space have diﬀerent dimensionalities.

Crossing to a contiguous cell is implies going between two regions in (2), so one element S c
ij in
(5) changes its value, and this change can never be between + and − because this would mean
crossing Hc

ij avoiding the region ci = cj.

Deﬁnition 2. A contiguous set are all the n-dimensional cells contiguous to a (n − 1)-
dimensional separator cell.

This allows to build a hierarchical structure: the cell lattice poset, that results from ordering
contiguous cells by dimensionality [1,7].

b of AN , corresponding to the sets of indices
Consider two arbitrary subpartitions Ada
χa = (ia1 , ia2 , ...iada +1) ⊂ ZN+1 and χb = (ib1 , ib2, ...ibdb+1) ⊂ ZN+1 respectively, and let χa∩b =

a and Adb

2

χa ∩ χb be the set of indices that are common to both partitions.

Deﬁnition 3. Two cells ζa ∈ Ada
ij = S b
said to be compatible if S a

a and ζb ∈ Adb
ij ∀ i, j ∈ χa∩b.

b with sign matrices S a and S b respectively, are

is the projection of all the cells in AN whose sign matrix S is

Theorem 2. The cell ζa ∈ Ada
a
such that Sij = S a
ij ∀ i, j ∈ χa.

This is an inmediate consequence of (3) and (5).

Let Ξa and Ξb be the set of cells in AN that are projected on ζa and ζb respectively

Theorem 3. The set Ξa ∩ Ξb is non empty iﬀ ζa and ζb are compatible.

Suppose we have ξ ∈ Ξa but ξ 6∈ Ξb, this means that the relative positions of the set of indices
χb\a = χb \ χa in the dominance sequence (4) is not the same as in ζb, since the reﬂexion group
of the arrangement is the symmetric group we only have to apply the reﬂection that corresponds
to the permutation that puts the indices χb\a in the dominance sequence in the same order as in
ζb, this generates a cell ξ

∈ Ξa ∩ Ξb.

II. The graph of cells

Theorems 2 and 3 suggest a way of building A3×N from partitions of lower dimensionality and
the lowest dimensionality for the CS of a 3D system is 4, moreover A3×4 has two important
properties:

1. it has a total of 13824 cells, computations on this structure are within reach,

2. one can reasonably assume that such small CS can be toroughly scanned by an MDS.

Atoms in MDSs are represented as pointlike structures surrounded by a force ﬁeld [8,9], the
convex envelope of a set of 4 points in 3D-space is an irregular polytope called a 4-simplex or
simplex, in what follows this denomination will be used to designate 4-atoms/points sets.

In ref. [2,3,4] it was proposed a procedure to build the CS of a molecular system that we outline
here

1. a molecular structure is decomposed into simplexes,

2. the morphology of simplexes can be decomposed into 3936 classes,

3. if an orientation in 3D-space has been deﬁned for the molecular structure, there is a pro-

cedure that allows to build the CS of each morphological class,

4. for each simplex the set of visited morphological classes is sampled from an MDS.

From the CS of the simplexes we can construct a graph denominated the graph of cells or G
which is deﬁned as follows:

Deﬁnition 4. Two simplexes are adjacent if they share a face.

Deﬁnition 5. The nodes of G are the visited cells of each simplex with edges towards the
compatible cells in adjacent simplexes.

This graph embodies all the information contained in the CS of a molecular system since

3

Theorem 4. A cell from A3×N is a subgraph of G where its nodes are exactly one cell from every
simplex that has edges towards every cell in adjacent simplexes.

A cell from A3×N is a class in an equivalence relation, since it contains all the 3D-structures that
have the same dominance sequence. Thus for each simplex there can be only one cell where the
indices have the same relative positions as in the dominance sequence of the mother cell, and
from deﬁnition 3 the cells in adjacent simplexes must be compatible. In what follows we use the
terms cell and 3D-structure interchangeably.

Finally notice that in this structure a node that fails to form an edge with an adjacent simplex
cannot exist since it is geometrically inconsistent.

A useful structure derived from G is its compact form C obtained by recursively substituing
every contiguous set of n-dimensional nodes by their (n−1)-dimensional separator cell.

IV. Determining a conical boundary for the molecular dynamics trajectory

G is a huge structure and it is useless to explore it in full, rather the approach we take here is
how to focus on regions of interest and how to extract useful information. We start with the
problem of ﬁnding the bounds of interesting regions, with a concrete exemple concerning a 2.1
ns bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)[10] MDS that was fully described in [11].

As in [11] we restrict ourselves to study the motion of C n
α carbons each bearing a number n
that reﬂects the linear order of residues along the polypeptide chain, as our description of CS is
strictly modular any conclusion that can be drawn on any subset of atoms is automatically valid
for the whole structure.

An information that can be easily extracted from a MDS are the dominance relations matrices
DRc, where c stands for either x, y or z, each element of these matrices deﬁnes the equation of
a face in a polyhedral cone in CS that is the boundary of the volume spanned by the molecular
system. The determination of the DRcs from the MDS [11] takes the following steps:

• First, the simplex corresponding to the residue numbers Sr = {6, 36, 40, 47} was selected as
the reference simplex because all along the MDS it stays within one morphological class,
and because it spans a wide range within the molecule.

• Second, the coordinates of Sr in the 1st MD frame were taken as a reference and the other
frames were rotated and translated so that the RMS between Sr(1) and Sr(f ) be a minimum
[12].

• Third, the quantities DRc

ij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N +1, were determined

– DRc
– DRc
– DRc

ij = + , DRc
ij = − , DRc
ij = DRc

ji = − if ci > cj for all coordinate frames.
ji = + if ci < cj for all coordinate frames.
ji = 0 if neither of the above relations holds.

The meaning of the matrix elements is obvious if DRc
ij = +/− means that the trajectory always
ij (2), DRc
stays on the positive/negative side of Hx
ij = 0 means that the trajectory can be on
either side. The matrices for x, y and z for the MDS [11] are shown in Figure 1, the number of
non-zero terms in the matrix is the dimension of the cone.

Antisymmetric dominance relations matrices for the Cα coordinates, only the upper triangle is shown. For sake of
clarity row and column amino acid numbers can be read from the annotated axes r and c. A matrix element can
have three values

+ xr > xc for all coordinate frames in the molecular dynamics run.
- xr < xc for all coordinate frames in the molecular dynamics run.

0 neither of the above relations holds.

III. The fragmentation of the cone

The dominance relations matrices DRc encode a lot of information about the structure of the
volume occuped by the system in CS. They give us the range of positions that a given coordinate
can have in the dominance sequence (3)

Theorem 5. The minimum position of a coordinate cµ is the number of matrix elements DRc
µj =
+ plus 1 , 1 ≤ j ≤ N , j 6= µ, and the maximum position is the minimum position plus the
number of matrix elements DRc

µj = 0 , 1 ≤ j ≤ N , j 6= µ.

The index µ in the dominance sequence must always stay to the right of the elements it dominates
if there are n+ of such elements the minimum position of µ is n+ +1, on the other hand be n0
the number of indiferent relations, µ can be either to the right or to the left of any of these then
the maximum position of µ must be n++n0+1.

We can also extract from DRc the set of lower dimensional cells that we can expect to ﬁnd in C.
And this is most useful for fragmenting G into a set of subgraphs with more manageable size,
to do that we can proceed as follows: we select the indices cµ and cν that have the following
property

DRx

µν = DRy

µν = DRz

µν = 0

(6a)

Those are cells of dimension (N −1)×(N −1)×(N −1), that occur simultaneously for x, y and
z, this gives a greatly reduced number of possibilities compared with what we would get if we
considered only one or two dimensions in (6). In a dominance sequence like (4b) (6a) would form
a pattern

(...(µν)..., ...(µν)..., ...(µν)...)

(7a)

Other patterns arise as combinations of equations (6a) with cyclic permutations of indices, for
instance

DRx
DRx
DRx

µν = DRy
λµ = DRy
λν = DRy

µν = DRz
λµ = DRz
λν = DRz

µν = 0
λµ = 0
λν = 0

would form a pattern

(6b)

(...(λµν)..., ...(λµν)..., ...(λµν)...)

(7b)

that represents a cell of dimensions (N −2)×(N −2)×(N −2).

The set of allowed patterns deduced from the DRc matrices can be seen in table I. The next step
consists in calculating the sequences with maximal combinations of the patterns (7), i.e. that for
a given sequence the combination is such that no more patterns like (7) can be squeezed in. We
obtained a total of 9955112 possible sequences with an average of 14 patterns (7) per sequence,
only a fraction of these sequences is realizable: that correspond to 3D-structures that can be
found in C.

Each of these sequences can be considered as a mini-cone and from the dominance constraints
that (7) generates we can extract subgraphs from C with a manageable size.

IV. Computing discrete 3D-distances between cells.

In ordinary aﬃne spaces the distance between two points is the norm of the vector that results
from subtracting the coordinates of the two points. In our discrete space we can also compute the
discrete distance between two points by computing ﬁrst the discrete components of the 3D vector
obtained by subtracting the positions of the two points in the dominance sequence. The problem
we are going to discuss is how to measure the set of discrete distances between two points i and
j from the cells in G.

N−1
2 (cid:1) sets of cells from the simplexes that contain i and j
To do this we have to consider the (cid:0)
as vertices and to determine how many conformations there are, and for each conformation how
many points there are between the position of i and j, for each coordinate x, y and z.

Let us consider as an example the simplex S1 = {i, j, u, v}, there are 8 possible relative positions
that i and j can take in the dominance sequence of a cell, in this example we consider only those
cells that have the interval pattern

((i)(j) (i)(j) (i)(j))

(8)

suppose we have the cell

((i)(u)(v)(j)

(i)(v)(j)

(i)(u)(j))

(9a)

7

(for each coordinate we obviously disregard the positions outside the interval (i...j)), if there were
only 4 points in our system the distance between i and j would be dij = p(1 + 1) + 1 + 1. If we
admit the existence of a 5th point w in our system, and among the cells in S2 = {i, j, u, w}, we
ﬁnd the cell

((i)(u)(w)(j)

(i)(w)(j)

(i)(j))

(9b)

it is obvious that if we suppres the index v from (9a) and w from (9b) we end up with the same
pattern and we say that the projections (9a) and (9b) are compatible. On the other hand if (9a)
and (9b) correspond to two projections of the same structure then in the simplex S3 = {i, j, v, w}
there must exist a cell with the pattern

((i)(w)(v)(j)

(i)(w)(v)(j)

(i)(j))

(9c)

which is obviuosly compatible with (9a) and (9b), again if there were only 5 points in our system
−→
ij
we would have dij = p(1 + 1 + 1) + (1 + 1) + 1, where each component of the discrete vector
is the number of diﬀerent indices that fall in the dominance interval (i)(j) from a set of mutually
compatible sequences for every coordinate x, y and z.

The example above indicates that problem of ﬁnding the structures from the projections in the
graph G is equivalent to the problem of ﬁnding the cliques1 of a graph.

Theorem 6. For an interval pattern (8) if the projections (9) are the nodes of a graph with
edges between compatible projections then the cells that are the projection of a 3D-structure form
a clique.

V. Conclusion

In [1-4] it was made clear that the graph of cells is the ”structure” that contains the dynamical
states of a molecular system, thus if a global view of the dynamics of molecular systems is a
necessity this is one structure that must be studied.

This paper is a ﬁrst step in solving the problem of managing this huge graph. Three issues have
been addressed:

1. we can give bounds that delimit interesting regions in CS,

2. we can decompose the graph into a hierarchy of smaller components,

3. and the crucial problem of extracting distances that are needed for computing energies has

been clearly deﬁned.

These three issues form the basis that is needed for doing phenomenological studies with molecular
systems that we expect to be the subject of future works in this series.

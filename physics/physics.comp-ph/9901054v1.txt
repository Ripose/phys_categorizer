An Eﬃcient Molecular Dynamics Scheme for the Calculation of Dopant Proﬁles due
to Ion Implantation

(February 2, 2008)

We present a highly eﬃcient molecular dynamics scheme for calculating the concentration depth
proﬁle of dopants in ion irradiated materials. The scheme incorporates several methods for reducing
the computational overhead, plus a rare event algorithm that allows statistically reliable results
to be obtained over a range of several orders of magnitude in the dopant concentration. We give
examples of using this scheme for calculating concentration proﬁles of dopants in crystalline silicon.
Here we can predict the experimental proﬁle over ﬁve orders of magnitude for both channeling and
non-channeling implants at energies up to 100s of keV. The scheme has advantages over binary
collision approximation (BCA) simulations, in that it does not rely on a large set of empirically
ﬁtted parameters. Although our scheme has a greater computational overhead than the BCA, it is
far superior in the low ion energy regime, where the BCA scheme becomes invalid.

I. INTRODUCTION

The principal reason for implanting ions∗ into silicon wafers is to dope regions within the substrate, and hence modify
their electrical properties in order to create electronic devices. The quest for ever increasing processor performance
demands smaller device sizes. The measurement and modeling of dopant proﬁles within these ultra shallow junction
devices is challenging, as eﬀects that were negligible at high implant energies become increasingly important as the
implant energy is lowered. The experimental measurement of dopant proﬁles by secondary ion mass spectrometry
(SIMS) becomes problematic for very low energy (less than 10 keV) implants. There is a limited depth resolution of
measured proﬁles due to proﬁle broadening, as the SIMS ion-beam produces ‘knock-on’s, and so leads to eﬀects such
as diﬀusion of dopants and mixing. The roughness and disorder of the sample surface can also convolute the proﬁle,
although this can be avoided to a large extent by careful sample preparation1.

The use of computer simulation as a method for studying the eﬀects of ion bombardment of solids is well established.
Binary collision approximation2 (BCA), ‘event-driven’ codes have traditionally been used to calculate such properties
as ranges of implanted species and the damage distributions resulting from the collision cascade. In this model, each
ion trajectory is constructed as a series of repulsive two-body encounters with initially stationary target atoms, and
with straight line motion between collisions. Hence the algorithm consists of ﬁnding the next collision partner, and
then calculating the asymptotic motion of the ion after the collision. This allows for eﬃcient simulation, but leads to
failure of the method at low ion energies. The BCA approach breaks down when multiple collisions (where the ion has
simultaneous interactions with more than one target atom) or collisions between moving atoms become signiﬁcant,
when the crystal binding energy is of the same order as the energy of the ion, or when the time spent within a collision
is too long for the calculation of asymptotic trajectories to be valid. Such problems are clearly evident when one
attempts to use the BCA to simulate channeling in semiconductors; here the interactions between the ion and the
target are neither binary nor collisional in nature, rather they occur as many simultaneous soft interactions which
steer the ion down the channel.

An alternative to the BCA is to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which has long been applied to the
investigation of ion bombardment of materials3,4, to calculate the ion trajectories5,6. The usefulness of this approach
was once limited by its computational cost and the lack of realistic models to describe materials. With the increase
in computational power, the development of eﬃcient algorithms, and the production of accurate empirical potentials,
it is now feasible to conduct realistic MD simulations. In the classical MD model, atoms are represented by point
masses that interact via an empirical potential function that is typically a function of bond lengths and angles; in
the case of Si a three-body or many-body potential, rather than a pair potential is required to model the stable

has no implication to the charge state of either atom type.

diamond lattice and to account for the bulk crystal properties. The trajectories of atoms are obtained by numerical
integration of Newton’s laws, where the forces are obtained from the analytical derivative of the potential function.
Thus, MD provides a far more realistic description of the collision processes than the BCA, but at the expense of
a greater computational requirement. Here we present a highly eﬃcient MD scheme that is optimized to calculate
the concentration proﬁles of ions implanted into crystalline silicon. The algorithms are incorporated into our implant
modeling molecular dynamics code, REED†, which runs on many architectures either as a serial, or as a trivially
parallel program.

II. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS MODEL

The basis of the molecular dynamics model is a collection of empirical potential functions that describe interactions
between atoms and give rise to forces between them. In addition to the classical interactions described by the potential
functions, the interaction of the ion with the electrons within the target is required for ion implant simulations, as this
is the principle way in which the ion loses energy. This is accomplished via a phenomenological electronic stopping-
power model. Other ingredients necessary to the computation are a description of the target material structure and
thermal vibration within the solid. It is also necessary to deﬁne a criterion to decide when the ion has come to rest
in the substrate. We terminate a trajectory when the total energy of the ion falls below 5 eV. This was chosen to be
well below the displacement threshold energy of Si (around 20 eV)7.

A. Empirical Potential Functions

Interactions between Si atoms are modeled by a many-body potential developed by Tersoﬀ8. This consists of Morse-
like repulsive and attractive pair functions of interatomic separation, where the attractive component is modiﬁed by
a many-body function that has the role of an eﬀective Pauling bond order. The many-body term incorporates
information about the local environment of a bond; due to this formalism the potential can describe features such as
defects and surfaces, which are very diﬀerent to the tetrahedral diamond structure.

ZBL ‘pair speciﬁc’ screened Coulomb potentials9 are used to model the ion-Si interactions for As, B, and P ions.
Where no ‘pair speciﬁc’ potential was available, the ZBL ‘universal’ potential has been used. This is smoothly
truncated with a cosine cutoﬀ between 107% and 147% of the sum of the covalent radii of the atoms involved; the
cutoﬀ distances were chosen as they give a screening function that approximates the ‘pair speciﬁc’ potentials for the
examples available to us.

The ZBL ‘universal’ potential is also used to describe the close-range repulsive part of the Tersoﬀ Si-Si potential,
as the standard form is not suﬃciently strong for small atomic separations. The repulsive Morse term is splined to
a shifted ZBL potential, by joining the two functions at the point where they are co-tangent. In the case of Si-Si
interactions, the join is at an atomic separation of 0.69 ˚A, and requires the ZBL function to be shifted by 148.7 eV.
The increase in the value of the short-range repulsive potential compensates for the attractive part of the Tersoﬀ
potential, which is present even at short-range.

B. Inelastic Energy Loss

The Firsov model10 is used to describe the loss of kinetic energy from the ion due to inelastic collisions with target
atoms. We implement this using a velocity dependent pair potential, as derived by Kishinevskii11. This gives the
force between atoms i and j as:

and χ(x) is a screening function, Z is atomic number (Z1 > Z2), R is atomic separation, and a = (9π2/128)1/3aB.
For consistency with the ion-Si interactions, we use the ZBL ‘universal’ screening function within the integral; there
are no ﬁtted parameters in this model.

We have found that it is necessary to include energy loss due to inelastic collisions, and energy loss due to electronic

processes is dominant and ﬁt it to model all energy loss for varying energies and directions.

C. Electronic Stopping Model

A new model that involves both global and local contributions to the electronic stopping is used for the electronic
energy loss6,12,13. This modiﬁed Brandt-Kitagawa14 model was developed for semi-conductors and contains only one
ﬁtted parameter per ion species, for all energies and incident directions. We believe that by using a realistic stopping
model, with the minimum of ﬁtted parameters, we obtain a greater transferability to the modeling of implants outside
the ﬁtting set. This should be contrasted to many BCA models which require completely diﬀerent models for diﬀerent
ion species or even for diﬀerent implant angles for the same ion species, and that contain several ﬁtted parameters
per species15,16.

Our model has been successfully used to describe the implant of As, B, P, and Al ions with energies in the sub
MeV range into crystalline Si in the h100i, h110i, and non-channeling directions, and also into amorphous Si. While
initially developed for use in BCA simulations, the only modiﬁcation required to the model for its use in MD is to
allow for the superposition of overlapping charge distributions, due to the fact that the ion is usually interacting
with more than one atom at a time. The one ﬁtting parameter is r0
s , the ‘average’ one electron radius of the target
material, which is adjusted to account for oscillations in the Z1 dependence of the electronic stopping cross-section17.

D. Structure of the Target Material

For the calculations presented here, the target is crystalline Si with a surface amorphous layer. The amorphous
structure was obtained from a simulation of repeated radiation damage and annealing, of an initially crystalline section
of material18. Thermal vibrations of atoms are modeled by displacing atoms from their lattice sites using a Debye
model. We use a Debye temperature of 519.0 K for Si obtained by recent electron channeling measurements19. This
gives an rms thermal vibrational amplitude in one dimension of 0.0790 ˚A at 300.0 K. Note, we do not use the Debye
temperature as a ﬁtting parameter in our model, as is often done in BCA models15. The thermal velocity of the
atoms is unimportant as it is so small compared to the ion velocity, and is set to zero.

At present there is no accumulation of damage within our simulations, as we wish to verify the fundamental model
with the absolute minimum of parameters that can be ﬁt. At a later date we will incorporate a statistical damage
model into our simulations in a manner similar to that used in BCA codes. We also intend to include the capability
of using amorphous, or polycrystalline targets in our simulations.

III. EFFICIENT MOLECULAR DYNAMICS ALGORITHMS

During the time that MD has been in use, many algorithms have been developed to enhance the eﬃciency of
simulations. Here we apply a combination of methods to increase the eﬃciency of the type of simulation that we are
interested in. We incorporate both widely used methods, which are brieﬂy mentioned below, and new or lesser known
algorithms for this speciﬁc type of simulation which we describe in greater detail.

We employ neighbor lists20–22 to make the potential and force calculation O(N ), where N is the number of particles.
Coarse grained cells are used in the construction of the neighbor list; this is combined with a Verlet neighbor list
algorithm to minimize the size of the list. Atoms within 125% of the largest interaction distance are stored in the

neighbor list, which is updated only when the relative motion of atoms is suﬃcient for interacting neighbors to have
changed.

B. Timestep selection

The paths of the atoms are integrated using Verlet’s algorithm21, with a variable timestep that is dependent upon
both kinetic and potential energy of atoms20. For high energy simulations the potential energy as well as the velocity
of atoms is important, as atoms may be moving slowly but have high, and rapidly changing, potential energies during
impacts. The timestep is selected using:

(4)

∆tn =

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where KEi, P Ei and Mi are the kinetic energy, potential energy and mass respectively of atom i, and CDIS is a
constant with a value of 0.10 ˚A. Away from hard collisions, only the kinetic energy term is important, and the timestep
is selected to give the fastest atom a movement of CDIS in a single timestep. When the timestep is increasing, it is
limited by:

∆t′

n = min(1.05 × ∆tn−1, 3

4 ∆tn−1 + 1

4 ∆tn)

to prevent rapid oscillations in the size of the timestep, and the maximum timestep is limited to 2.0 fs.

The timestep selection scheme was checked to ensure that the total energy in a full (i.e., without the modiﬁcations
described below) MD simulation was well conserved for any single ion implant with no electronic stopping; e.g.
in
the case of a non-channeling (10◦ tilt and 22◦ rotation) 5 keV As ion into a 21168 atom Si{100} target, the energy
change was 3.6 eV (0.004%) during the 250 fs it took the ion to come to rest.

C. Domain following

Even with the computation resources available today it is infeasible to calculate dopant proﬁles by full MD simula-
tion. Although the method is O(N ) in the number of atoms involved, the computational requirements scale extremely
quickly with the ion energy. The cost of the simulation can be estimated as the number of atoms in the system
multiplied by the number of timesteps required. Consider the case of an ion, subject to an energy loss proportional to
its velocity, v(t), which is then given by v(t) = u exp(−αt) where u is its initial velocity and α is the loss coeﬃcient.
Each dimension of the system must scale approximately as the initial ion velocity, u, to fully contain an ion-path.
If the timestep size is chosen so that the maximum distance moved by any particle in a single step is constant, the
number of timesteps is approximately proportional to the ion distance.

Hence the method is roughly O(u4). Although it is possible to compute a few trajectories at ion energies of up
to 100s of keV, the calculation of the thousands necessary to produce statistically reliable dopant proﬁles is out of
the question. Therefore, we have concentrated on developing a restricted MD scheme which is capable of producing
accurate dopant proﬁles with a much smaller computational overhead.

As we are only concerned with the path of the implanted ion, we only need to consider the region of silicon
immediately surrounding the ion. We continually create and destroy silicon atoms, to follow the domain of the
substrate that contains the ion. Material is built in slabs one unit cell thick to ensure that the ion is always surrounded
by a given number of cells on each side. Material is destroyed if it is outside the domain deﬁned by the ion position
and the domain thickness. In this scenario, the ion sees the equivalent of a complete crystal, but primary knock-on
atoms (PKAs) and material in the wake of the ion path behave unphysically, due to the small system dimensions.
Hence we have reduced the cost of the algorithm to O(u), at the expense of losing information on the ﬁnal state of the
Si substrate. This algorithm is similar to the ‘translation’ approach used in the MDRANGE computer code developed
by Nordlund23. The relationship between the full and restricted MD approaches is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 2 illustrates a single domain following trajectory. The ion is initially above a semi-inﬁnite volume that is the
silicon target. As the ion approaches the surface, atoms begin to be created in front of it, and destroyed in its wake.
This process is continued until the ion comes to rest at some depth in the silicon substrate. Several thousand of such
trajectories are combined to produce the depth proﬁle of implanted ions.

D. Moving Atom Approximation

This was ﬁrst introduced by Harrison4,24 to increase the eﬃciency of ion sputtering yield simulations.

In this
scheme atoms are divided into two sets; those that are ‘on’ have their positions integrated, and those that are ‘oﬀ’ are
stationary. At the start of the simulation, only the ion is turned on, and is the only atom to have forces calculated
and to be integrated. Some of the ‘oﬀ’ atoms will be used in the force calculations and will have forces assigned
If the resultant force exceeds a certain threshold, the atom is turned on and its motion is integrated.
to them.
The simulation proceeds in this way with more and more atoms having their position integrated as energy becomes
dispersed throughout the system.

We use two thresholds in our simulation; one for atoms interacting directly with the ion, and one for atom-atom
interactions. We are, of course, mostly concerned with generating the correct motion for the ion, so the ion-atom
interactions are of the most critical and require a lower threshold than the atom-atom interactions. In fact, for any
reasonable threshold value, almost any ion-atom interaction will result in the atom being turned on, due to the large
ion energy. Hence the ion-atom threshold is set to zero in these simulations, as adjusting the value gives no increase
in eﬃciency.

In the case of the atom-atom threshold, we estimate a reasonable value by comparison to simulations without the
moving atom approximation (MAA). Smith et al.24 found a force threshold of 1.12 × 10−9 N for both atom-atom
and ion-atom interactions gave the correct sputtering yield (when compared to simulations without the MAA) in the
case of 1 keV Ar implant into Si. We have found a larger value (8.0 × 10−9 N) gives the correct dopant proﬁle, when
compared to a simulations without the approximation. Our ability to use a larger value is due to two reasons. The
motion of atoms not directly interacting with the ion only has a secondary eﬀect on its motion by inﬂuencing the
position of directly interacting atoms, so small errors in the positions of these atoms has little consequence. Also, by
dividing the interactions into two sets, we do not have to lower the threshold to give the correct ion-atom interactions.

E. Pair Potential Approximation and Recoil Interaction Approximation

While we use a many-body potential to describe a stable silicon lattice for low energy implants, this introduces
a signiﬁcant overhead to our simulations. For higher ion velocities, we do not need to use such a level of detail. A
pair potential is suﬃcient to model the Si-Si interactions, as only the repulsive interaction is signiﬁcant. Also, as the
lattice is built at a metastable point with respect to a pair potential, with atoms initially frozen due to the MAA,
and the section of material is only simulated for a short period of time, stability is not important. Hence, at a certain
ion velocity we switch from the complete many-body potential to a pair potential approximation (PPA) for the Si-Si
interactions. This is achieved in our code by setting the many-body parameter within the Tersoﬀ potential to its
value for undistorted tetrahedral Si, and results in a Morse potential splined to a screened coulomb potential.

We make a further approximation for still higher ion energies, where only the ion-Si interactions are signiﬁcant
in determining the ion path. For ion velocities above a set threshold we calculate only ion-Si interactions. This
approximation, termed the recoil interaction approximation (RIA)23, brings the MD scheme close to many BCA
implementations. The major diﬀerence that exists between the two approaches is that the ion path is obtained by
integration, rather than by the calculation of asymptotes, and that multiple interactions are, by the nature of the
method, handled in the correct manner.

We have determined thresholds of 90.0 eV/mu and 270.0 eV/mu for the PPA, and RIA, respectively are suﬃciently
high that both low and high energy calculated proﬁles are unaﬀected by their use. As the thresholds are based on
the ion velocity, a single high energy ion simulation will switch between levels of approximation as the ion slows down
and will produce the correct end of range behavior.

IV. RARE EVENT ALGORITHM

A typical dopant concentration proﬁle in crystalline silicon, as illustrated in Fig. 3, has a characteristic shape
consisting of a near-surface peak followed by an almost exponential decay over some distance into the material, with
a distinct end of range distance. The concentration of dopant in the tail of the proﬁle is several orders of magnitude
less than that at the peak. Hence if we wish to calculate a statistically signiﬁcant concentration at all depths of the
proﬁle we will have to run many ions that are stopped near the peak for every one ion that stops in the tail, and most
of the computational eﬀort will not enhance the accuracy of the proﬁle we are generating.

In order to remove this redundancy from our calculations, we employ an ‘atom splitting’ scheme25 to increase the
sampling in the deep component of the concentration proﬁle. Every actual ion implanted is replaced by several virtual

5

ions, each with an associated weighting. At certain splitting depths in the material, each ion is replaced by two ions,
each with a weighting of half that prior to splitting. Each split ion trajectory is run separately, and the weighting of
the ion is recorded along with its ﬁnal depth. As the split ions see diﬀerent environments (material is built in front of
the ion, with random thermal displacements), the trajectories rapidly diverge from one another. Due to this scheme,
we can maintain the same number of virtual ions at any depth, but their weights decrease with depth. Each ion could
of course be split into more than two at each depth, with the inverse change in the weightings, but for simplicity and
to keep the ion density as constant as possible we work with two.

To maximize the advantages of this scheme, we dynamically update the splitting depths. The correct distribution of
splitting depths is obtained from an approximate proﬁle for the dopant concentration. The initial proﬁle is either read
in (e.g. from SIMS data), or estimated from the ion type, energy and incident direction using a crude interpolation
scheme based on known depths and concentrations for the peak and tail. Once the simulation is running, the proﬁle
and the splitting depths are re-evaluated at intervals. The algorithm to determine the splitting depths from a given
proﬁle is illustrated in Fig. 3. At the start of the simulation, we specify the number of orders of magnitude, M , of
change in the concentration of moving ions over which we wish to reliably calculate the proﬁle. We split ions at depths
where the total number of ions (ignoring weighting) becomes half of the number of actual implanted ions. Hence we
will use N splitting depths, where N is the largest integer ≤ M × log2 10. The splitting depths, di (1 ≤ i ≤ N ), are
then chosen such that:

di

C(x) dx = (1 − ( 1
2 )

) ×

C(x) dx

(5)

where C(x) is the concentration of stopped ions (i.e., the dopant concentration) at depth x. Although we are using
an approximate proﬁle from few ions to generate the splitting depths, the integration is a smoothing operation and
so gives good estimates of the splitting depths.

To minimize the storage requirements due to ion splitting, each real ion is run until it comes to rest, and the state
of the domain is recorded at each splitting depth passed. The deepest split ion is then run, and further split ions are
stored if it passes any splitting depths. This is repeated until all split ions have been run, then the next real ion is
started. Hence the maximum we ever need to store is one domain per splitting depth (i.e., 16 domains when splitting
over 5 orders of magnitude).

V. SIMULATION DETAILS

All simulations were run with a Si{100} target at a temperature of 300 K. A surface amorphous layer of one, or
three unit cells thickness was used. Dopant proﬁles were calculated for As, B, P, and Al ions; in each case it was
assumed that only the most abundant isotope was present in the ion beam. The direction of the incident ion beam
is speciﬁed by the angle of tilt, θ◦, from normal and the azimuthal angle φ◦, as (θ,φ). The incident direction of the
ions was either (0,0), i.e. normal to the surface (h100i channeling case), (7–10,0–30) (non-channeling), or (45,45)
(h110i channeling), and a beam divergence of 1.0◦ was always assumed. Simulations were run for 1,000 ions, with the
splitting depths updated every 100 ions. A domain of 3×3×3 unit cells was used and the proﬁle was calculated over
either 3, or 5 orders of magnitude change in concentration. The simulations were run on pentium pro workstations
running the Red Hat Linux operating system with the GNU g77 Fortran compiler, or SUN Ultra-sparc workstations
with the SUN Solaris operating system and SUN Fortran compiler. The running code typically requires about 750K
of memory.

VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Two sets of results are presented; we ﬁrst demonstrate the eﬀectiveness and stability of the rare event enhancement
scheme, and then give examples of data produced by the simulations and compare to SIMS data. Example timings
from simulations are also given. A more extensive set of calculated proﬁles will be published separately26.

A. Performance of the Rare Event Algorithm

An example of the evolution of splitting depths during a simulation is shown in Fig. 4, for the case of non-channeling
5 keV As implanted into Si{100}. The positions of the splitting depths near the peak stabilize quickly. Splitting depths
near the tail take far longer to stabilize, as these depend on ions that channel the maximum distance into the material.

6

Although atom splitting enhances the number of (virtual) ions that penetrate deep into the material, the occurrence
of an ion that will split to yield ions at these depths is still a relatively rare event. The fact that all splitting depths
do stabilize is also an indication that we have run enough ions to generate good statistics for the entire proﬁle.

The paths of 5 keV As ions implanted at normal incidence into Si{100} are shown in Fig. 5, with the number of
splittings shown by the line shading. The 1,000 implanted real ions were split to yield a total of 19,270 virtual ions.
The paths taken by 27 split ions produced from the ﬁrst real ion of this simulation, and the resulting distribution of
the ion positions are shown in Fig. 6. The ﬁnal ions are the result of between 3 and 6 splittings, depending upon the
range of each trajectory. This is typical of the distribution of splittings for one real ion; the ﬁnal depths of ions are
not evenly distributed over the entire ion range, but are bunched around some point within this range. This reﬂects
how the impact position of the ion and collisions during its passage through the amorphous layer aﬀect its ability to
drop into a channel once in the crystalline material. The weighting of the second 500 of the ions (after the splitting
depths had stabilized) is plotted against ﬁnal depth in Fig. 7 (note the log scale).

We have estimated the uncertainty in the calculated dopant proﬁles in order to judge the increase in eﬃciency
obtained through the use of the rare event enhancement scheme. The uncertainty was estimated by dividing the ﬁnal
ion depths into 10 sets. A depth proﬁle was calculated from each set using a histogram of 100 bins, with constant bin
size. A reasonable measure of the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the distribution of the 10 concentrations for
each bin. Fig. 8 shows calculated dopant proﬁles from 1,000 real ions for the case of 2 keV As at (7,0) into Si{100},
obtained with and without atom splitting over ﬁve orders of magnitude. The proﬁles are plotted with the uncertainty
represented by the size of error bars; the length of each error bar corresponds to half the standard deviation of
concentrations in that bin. The uncertainty is constant in the case of the proﬁle obtained with the rare event scheme,
whereas the proﬁle obtained without the scheme is only reliable over one order of magnitude.

Timings from these simulations, and a simulation with splitting to three orders of magnitude are given in Table I.
From these timings, we can estimate the eﬃciency gain due to the rare event algorithm. We decrease the time
required by a factor of 89 in the case of calculating a proﬁle to three orders of magnitude, and by a factor of 886 when
calculating a proﬁle over 5 orders of magnitude, compared to the estimated time requirements without rare event
enhancement. The gain in eﬃciency increases exponentially with the number of orders of magnitude in concentration
over which we wish to calculate the proﬁle.

B. Comparison of Proﬁles to SIMS Data

The remaining ﬁgures show the calculated concentration proﬁle of B, As, and P ions for various incident energies
and directions. Proﬁles were generated from a histogram of 100 bins, using adaptive bin sizes; the ﬁnal ion depths
were sorted and the same number of virtual ions assigned to each bin. No other processing, or smoothing of the
proﬁles was done. Also shown are low dose (≤ 1013 ions/cm2) SIMS data; for comparison, all proﬁles were scaled
to an eﬀective dose of 1012 ions/cm2. We have also examined Al ion implants, but were unable to match calculated
proﬁles to the available SIMS data27 for a physically reasonable parameter value in our electronic stopping model.
This may be due to one or more of the following reasons; Al is the only metal that we are implanting; the Al-Si
interaction is the only interaction for which we do not have a pair speciﬁc ZBL potential; we only have a very limited
set of SIMS data to compare to.

In the case of the low energy (≤ 10 keV) implants, we compare to SIMS data obtained with a thin and well controlled
surface layer28,29; here we assume one unit cell thickness of surface disorder in our simulations. For the other cases
considered here29,30, the surface was less well characterized; we assume three unit cells of disorder at the surface, as
this is typical of implanted Si. For the low energy implants, we have calculated proﬁles over a change of ﬁve orders
of magnitude in concentration; for the higher energy implants we calculate proﬁles over 3 orders of magnitude. The
results of the REED calculations show good agreement with the experimental data. In the case of the low energy
implants, the SIMS proﬁle is only resolved over two orders of magnitude in some cases, while we can calculate the
proﬁle over ﬁve orders of magnitude.

We give timing results from several simulations, as examples of the cpu requirements of our implementation of the
model. Note, the results presented here are from a functional version of REED, but the code has yet to be fully
optimized to take advantage of the small system sizes (around 200 atoms). Timing data are given in Table II, for
proﬁles calculated over ﬁve orders of magnitude on a single pentium pro. Run times are dependent on the ion type
and its incident direction, but are most strongly linked to the ion velocity. We estimate a runtime of approximately
30 hours per

keV/mu, for this version of our code.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have developed a restricted molecular dynamics code to simulate the ion implant process and
directly calculate ‘as implanted’ dopant proﬁles. This gives us the accuracy obtained by time integrating atom paths,
whilst obtaining an eﬃciency far in excess of full MD simulation. There is very good agreement between the MD
results and SIMS data for B, P, and As implants. We are unable to reproduce published SIMS data for Al implants27
with our current model. This discrepancy is currently being investigated; our ﬁndings will be published separately13.
We can calculate the dopant proﬁle to concentrations one or two orders of magnitude below that measurable by SIMS
for the channeling tail of low dose implants.

The scheme described here gives a viable alternative to the BCA approach. Although it is still more expensive
computationally, it is suﬃciently eﬃcient to be used on modern desktop computer workstations. The method has
two major advantages over the BCA approach: (i) Our MD model consists only of standard empirical potentials
developed for bulk Si and for ion-solid interactions. The only ﬁtting is in the electronic stopping model, and this
involves only one parameter per ion species. This should be contrasted to the many parameters that have to be ﬁt
in BCA models. We believe that by using physically based models for all aspects of the program, with the minimum
of ﬁtting parameters, we obtain good transferability to the modeling of implants outside of our ﬁtting set. (ii) The
method does not break down at the low ion energies necessary for production of the next generation of computer
technology; it gives the correct description of multiple, soft interactions that occur both in low energy implants, and
high energy channeling.

We are currently working to fully optimize the code, in order to maximize its eﬃciency. The program is also being
extended to include a model for ion induced damage, amorphous and polycrystalline targets, and to model cluster
implants such as BF2. We also note that the scheme can be easily extended to include other ion species such as Ge,
In and Sb, and substrates such as GaAs and SiC.

We gratefully acknowledge David Cai and Charles Snell for providing us with their insight during many discussions,
and Al Tasch and co-workers for providing preprints of their work and SIMS data. This work was performed under
the auspices of the United States Department of Energy.

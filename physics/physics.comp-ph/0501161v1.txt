Toroidial systems are relevant to fusion [1], heat transfer [2, 3], vibrational [4, 5, 6,
7], electromagnetic [8] and, recently, nanostructure physics [9, 10, 11, 12]. For problems
restricted to the neighborhood of a toroidal surface, i.e., to those on or near toroidal shells,
Gram-Schmidt (GS) functions on T 2 could potentially prove useful. As noted elsewhere,
the calculation of higher order GS states may be time consuming and oftentimes subject to
numerical error [6] when performed in a black-box fashion, particulary when trigonometric
functions are employed as the primitive basis set and integrations are performed over a non-
trivial integration measure. In this note we show that there exists a simple algorithm for
constructing higher order GS functions on T 2 that eliminates these diﬃculties and proceed
to apply the functions to the problem of an electron on T 2 in a magnetic ﬁeld directed along
the z-axis.

The geometry adopted here parameterizes a toroidal surface of major radius R and minor

radius a in terms of cylindrical coordinate unit vectors by

with W = R + a cosθ. Applying d to Eq.(1) gives

with θ =

sinθρ + cosθk. The metric elements gij can be read oﬀ of

so that the integration measure is

r(θ, φ) = W (θ)ρ + a sinθk

dr = adθ θ + W dφφ

It will prove useful in what follows to write the Laplacian derived from Eq. (3); it is [13]

The solutions of the Schrodinger equation derived from Eq. (5) can be taken of the form
ψn(θ)eiνφ with ν
integer. A procedure for determining free particle surface wave functions
ψn(θ) has been given elsewhere [13] and extended to several special cases in [14, 15, 16].
However, if an arbitrary potential V (θ, φ) is included in the Hamiltonian, many θ, φ states
may be necessary in a basis set expansion to achieve suitable convergence for the eigenvalues
and wave functions of H(θ, φ).

The θ

θ symmetry of the Laplacian allows the solutions of the Schrodinger equation
to be split into even and odd functions, and the primitive basis set can be taken to possess
this property,

cos[nθ],

vn(θ) =

sin[nθ].

Here for the sake of brevity, we will consider only the even functions in detail and later
comment brieﬂy on the simple modiﬁcation needed for the odd functions. Setting α = a/R

and F (θ) = 1 + α cosθ, the simple but key point in what follows is the integrals encountered
in the GS procedure (irrelevant factors of R and a are dropped)

from which it is apparent that

cnm = (

(15)

To obtain the cnm the normalization factors must be determined. Consider the kth > 1
unnormalized state Φk; it is easy to establish Nk from

In summary, Eq. (17) serves to generate all normalization factors and Eq. (15) the GS
coeﬃcients. The sinusoidal function coeﬃcients may be obtained by the method employed
above by starting with c11 rather than c00 and letting N1 = 1.

It is worth noting that from Eq. (15) the ratio of successive coeﬃcients within a given

(n, m) series

allows for truncation approximations to be made for certain problems. To illustrate this
point, write Eq. (17) in continued fraction form; taking for example N4 (which is the largest
Nk that can be comfortably typeset),

Any symbolic algebra program can be utilized to evaluate this expression, but once known
to a given order of α = 2β it need not be evaluated any further. To O(α8) which occurs at

and a ﬁnal α
2 factor multiplies the expression of Eq. (20) to establish right hand side of
Eq. (18). Since α < 1, concatenating several NβN factors causes the series to converge
rapidly for larger n and smaller m. For quantum mechanical applications, the kinetic energy
operator yields an m2 factor for each term in the expansion given by Eq. (10), making it
possible to truncate higher states at say, three terms for suﬃciently large n (as set by the
particular problem)

An obvious immediate application for the GS states of relevance to nanoscience [9, 11, 12]

The basis expansion functions are taken as per Eqs. (11) - (14) with azimuthal eigen-
functions appended (the magnetic ﬁeld term considered here does not cause even (+) and
odd (-) functions to mix),

The matrix

is then easily constructed since the matrix elements can all be written in closed form, and
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors determined with a six-state expansion for each θ-parity [17]
(no truncations were performed).

Table 1 gives the even function ground and ﬁrst excited state energy eigenvalues and
wave functions for several values of ν and τ0. Table 2 gives the same for the odd functions
[18]. Three decimal place accuracy was achieved for the eigenvalues/ wave functions for
four of the six states generated from Hτ n¯n when τ0 = 10, which corresponds to a ﬁeld of
2.6 T for a torus with R = 50 nm. Although a large scale treatment of this problem was
considered outside the scope of this work, it should be noted that because the basis states
are so simple to generate the only inherent limitation to such a treatment is the matrix
inversion. Additionally, the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian for an oﬀ-axis magnetic
ﬁeld that comprises the general case

B = Bxi + Bzk

(29)

can also be done in closed form given suﬃcient patience [19].

In conclusion, we have presented an algebraic method to derive GS states on T 2 with
very little eﬀort. The ability to obtain these functions rapidly may prove of use to problems
in the areas mentioned in the opening paragraph of this note. As an example of their utility,
we have used them to calculate the spectra of an electron on the surface of a torus in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld.

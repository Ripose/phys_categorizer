OPTIMAL STRESSES IN STRUCTURES

REUVEN SEGEV AND GAL DEBOTTON

In memory of Israel Gilad (1949 (cid:21) 2005)

Abstrat. For a given external loading on a struture we onsider the

optimal stresses.

Ignoring the material properties the struture may

have, we look for the distribution of internal fores or stresses that is in

equilibrium with the external loading and whose maximal omponent is

the least. We present an expression for this optimal value in terms of

the external loading and the matrix relating the external degrees of free-

dom and the internal degrees of freedom. The implementation to (cid:28)nite

element models onsisting of elements of uniform stress distributions is

presented. Finally, we give an example of stress optimization for of a

two-element model of a ylinder under external tration.

1. INTRODUCTION

This paper presents an analysis of optimal stresses in strutures under

given loadings. In [1, 2, 3℄, optimal stress distributions for ontinuous bod-

ies were onsidered. Although the problem for a ontinuous body is more

di(cid:30)ult mathematially, the orresponding analysis for a struture having a

(cid:28)nite number of degrees of freedom is more relevant for engineering applia-

tions.

From the point of view of statis, engineering strutures(cid:22)starting from

simple trusses all the way to (cid:28)nite element models used for stress analysis of

ontinuous bodies, and evidently, ontinuous models of bodies(cid:22)are predom-

inantly statially indeterminate. Mathematially, this means that we have

more unknown parameters desribing the stress distribution in the struture

under onsideration than equilibrium equations. This mathematial problem

is solved usually by the introdution of onstitutive relations and by oupling

the statis problem with kinematis.

The work presented here takes a di(cid:27)erent approah to statially indetermi-

nate problems. Remaining within the framework of statis, we do not speify

any onstitutive relations and look for the values of the unknown omponents

that satisfy the equilibrium onditions and for whih the maximal ompo-

nent is the least. Spei(cid:28)ally, the problem may be stated as follows. Let

fd , d = 1, . . . , D , be the omponents of the known external loading vetor
on the struture where D is the number of degrees of freedom the struture

has, and let ϕn , n = 1, . . . , N , be the omponents of the unknown vetor of

internal fores(cid:22)stress-like entities. As we onsider statially indeterminate

problems, N > D . The equations of equilibrium will be of the form

AT (ϕ) = f,

or AT

dnϕn = fd,

where we use the summation onvention and the reason we write the matrix

rather than simply A will be made lear below. Thus, letting ϕmax =

as AT
maxn |ϕn| , we are looking for

where the minimum is taken over all ϕ satisfying AT (ϕ) = f .

Our basi result states that

Sopt
f = min
ϕ

{ϕmax} ,

Sopt
f = max

w

|fdwd|
n |Andwd|

,

where the maximum is taken over all global virtual displaement vetors

P
w = (w1, . . . , wD) of the struture, so fdwd is the virtual work performed by

the external fore vetor.

A related quantity that we onsider is the stress sensitivity of the struture

de(cid:28)ned as follows. Assuming that the internal fores have the same physial

dimension as the external fores (dimensions of fores or fores divided by

area), onsider the ratio

Kf =

Sopt
f
maxd |fd|

.

Thus, Kf measures the sensitivity of the struture to the external fore f .

Next, we let the external fore vary and we look for the worst possible ratio.

The stress sensitivity of the struture is de(cid:28)ned as

It is shown in Setion 3.5 that

We emphasize that K is a geometri, kinemati property of the struture,
P

i.e.., independent of material properties, loading onditions, et.

The paper is outlined as follows. We start with the notation and basi fats

regarding statially indeterminate strutures. Then, we prove the results

stated above. For the internal fore vetor ϕ, the value ϕmax is represented
as a norm, spei(cid:28)ally, the dual of the norm kχk =
n |χn| that we use
for internal displaements χ. The basi tool we use is the norm preserving

P

extension of funtionals (the simpli(cid:28)ed, (cid:28)nite dimensional ase of the Hahn-

Banah theorem). Next, we present some details regarding the appliation of

the method to the ase of (cid:28)nite element models onsisting of elements having

uniform stress distributions. Finally, in a way of example, we onsider the

loading.

2. STATICALLY INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES

An elementary example for the type of strutures we onsider is shown in

Fig. 1. Our method applies to a lot more ompliated strutures inluding

a large variety of (cid:28)nite element models.

2.1. Kinematis. The struture is assumed to have D degrees of freedom.
This means that we have a D-dimensional vetor spae W ontaining the

external in(cid:28)nitesimal virtual displaements (generalized veloities) that are

ompatible with the displaements boundary onditions at the supports and

the various onstraints implied by the strutural onnetions. A generi

virtual displaement in W will be denoted by w. Thus in our model example

of Fig. 1, the struture has two degrees of freedom and a generi virtual

displaement is of the form w = (w1, w2). Eah external degree of freedom
indues a base vetor in W .

Next we onsider the spae S ontaining nonompatible, or internal, in(cid:28)n-

itesimal virtual displaements of the struture. Suh an internal deformation

(cid:28)eld of our model example is shown in Fig. 1. Here, the onstraints of the

strutural interonnetions of the various strutural elements are not kept

(the onnetion at the bottom joint in the (cid:28)gure). In partiular, onstant

4

REUVEN SEGEV AND GAL DEBOTTON

strains within strutural elements may be represented as internal virtual dis-

plaement (cid:28)elds. A generi internal virtual displaement (cid:28)eld will be denoted

as χ. Clearly, internal deformations have more degrees of freedom than the
external ones. We assume formally that N , the dimension of S , is stritly
larger than D . The various internal degrees of freedom indue base vetors
in S . (Returning to our model example, we note that the internal degrees
of freedom, i.e, the base vetors in S , may be unit hanges in lengths of the

bars or unit axial strains in the bars. It will be onvenient also to de(cid:28)ne

for a uniform strain strutural member, suh as a bar in the example, base

vetors in S onsisting of unit strain omponents in the element multiplied

by its volume as in Setion 4.)

An important role in the kinematis of the struture is played by the

interpolation mapping

A : W −→ S.

(2.1)

This mapping assoiates an internal deformation vetor with every external

deformation. Clearly, as N > D , not all internal deformations may be ob-
tained as images of external deformations under A. We further note that in

ase the struture is not supported distint displaements (cid:28)elds that di(cid:27)er

by a rigid displaement (cid:28)eld indue the same strain (cid:28)eld. While unsup-

ported bodies may be onsidered following the methods of [2℄, we simplify

the analysis and assume that the supports prevent suh rigid displaement

(cid:28)elds. Thus, we assume mathematially that the interpolation mapping is

one-to-one, so the matrix of A is of full rank D .

2.2. Statis. An external fore f performs virtual work (power) for various
external displaements. Denoting by fd the omponent of the fore dual to
the degree of freedom wd , the virtual work may be written as

In other words, we regard an external fore as a linear funtional

and the olletion of all external fores is the dual spae W ∗
real valued linear mappings de(cid:28)ned on W .

ontaining all

In analogy, an internal fore ϕ performs virtual work for virtual internal
deformation (cid:28)elds. Denoting the omponent of the internal fore ϕ orre-
sponding to the omponent χn , by ϕn , n = 1, . . . , N , we write for the internal
virtual work performed by ϕ for the virtual displaement χ

f (w) = fdwd.

f : W −→ R

ϕ(χ) = ϕnχn.

ϕ : S −→ R,

Thus, an internal fore is a linear mapping

i.e., ϕ belongs to the spae S ∗
of real valued linear mapping on S . Note
that in ase the omponent χn indiates a onstant omponent of the strain

(2.4)

(2.5)

OPTIMAL STRESSES IN STRUCTURES

5

in some strutural element multiplied by its volume, then ϕn indiates the

orresponding stress omponent (see Setion 4).

The priniple of virtual work serves as the ondition for equilibrium within

the framework of the strutural model. Using the notation introdued above

it states that

ϕ(A(w)) = f (w),
for all external vetor (cid:28)elds w in W . Using matrix notation where we keep

(2.6)

the same symbol for a linear mapping (or a vetor) and its orresponding

matrix (or the orresponding olumn vetor) the priniple of virtual work is

written as

ϕT Aw = f T w.

(2.7)

Thus, the priniple of virtual work, or equivalently the equilibrium ondition,

may be written in any of the following forms

ϕ ◦ A = f, AT ϕ = f, Andϕn = fd, A∗(ϕ) = f,
where in the last equation above we used the dual mapping A∗ : S ∗ −→ W ∗
de(cid:28)ned by the ondition A∗(ϕ)(w) = ϕ(A(w)) and whose matrix is the
transpose of that of A as expeted.

(2.8)

Given an external fore f , the equilibrium onditions (2.8) provide a sys-
tem of D equations for the N omponents of the internal fore ϕ. As it
was assumed that N is stritly larger than D and that A is one-to-one,
this system of equations annot determine ϕ uniquely. In fat, there is an
(N − D)-dimensional vetor spae Φ = (A∗)−1 {f } of solutions to the equi-

librium problem.

3. OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS

For given strutures, where the material properties of the various stru-

tural elements are known, the onstitutive relations provide the additional

information so the internal fore vetor an be alulated uniquely for any

given external fore f . Here however, we onsider the situation where no
onstitutive relations are given a-priori, and among all solutions ϕ in Φ, we

look for the least bound on the maximal omponent.

Spei(cid:28)ally, for eah internal fore ϕ, we set
kϕk∞ = ϕmax = max
n

|ϕn| ,

and we look for

Sopt
f = min
ϕ

{kϕk∞} = min
ϕ

max
n

|ϕn|

,

where the minimum is taken over all internal fores ϕ satisfying A∗(ϕ) = f .

n

o

Thus, for the ase were the omponents of the internal fore represent stresses

in the various strutural elements, we are looking for the least bound on the

disretized approximating stress (cid:28)eld.

In order to evaluate Sopt

f

have to generate the spae of solutions Φ and then evaluate the optimal

diretly on the basis of its de(cid:28)nition, one would

(3.1)

(3.2)

6

REUVEN SEGEV AND GAL DEBOTTON

bound in that spae. The analysis we present in the sequel will give an

that does not require the solution of the equilibrium

expression for Sopt

f

equations (2.8).

3.1. A Solution as an Extension of a Funtional. Sine the interpola-

tion mapping A is one-to-one, its inverse

A−1 : Image A −→ W

is well de(cid:28)ned on its image, a subspae of S . Given an external fore f , we

onsider

f = f ◦ A−1 : Image A −→ R,

a linear mapping de(cid:28)ned on the subspae Image A. Note that the equilibrium
ondition f (w) = ϕ(A(w)), for a linear funtional ϕ on S may be written as

b

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

ϕ(χ) = f ◦ A−1(χ) =

f (χ)

for all ompatible internal (cid:28)elds χ in Image A. In other words, a solution
of the equilibrium equations is a linear mapping ϕ de(cid:28)ned on S that agrees
f to

on the subspae Image A. Thus, ϕ is an extension of

f = f ◦ A−1

b

with

the entire spae S .

b

It is noted that algebraially, given the linear funtional

f on the subspae,

b

it is straightforward to generate an extension of it to the entire spae. In

fat, it is su(cid:30)ient to show this for the ase where N − D = 1, so we have

b

to extend

In the general ase

f to a spae having one more dimension.

where N − D is any other (cid:28)nite number, the proedure an be arried out

b

indutively adding one dimension at a time. To generate suh an extension

ϕ, one an hoose an internal displaement vetor χ1 that does not belong
to Image A and give an arbitrary value to c = ϕ(χ1). Any vetor χ in the

larger spae may be written as a linear ombination

χ = χ0 + aχ1

(3.6)

for a ompatible internal virtual displaement χ0 in Image A and a real
number a. Thus, for any extension ϕ we have

3.2. Norms. Realling that we are looking for a solution of the equilibrium

equations that minimizes kϕk∞ = maxn |ϕn|, we mention a number of useful

b

properties of this norm on the spae of internal fores. Consider the norm

on the spae S given by

(3.7)

(3.8)

ϕ(χ) = ϕ(χ0 + aχ1)

= ϕ(χ0) + aϕ(χ1)

=

f (χ0) + ac.

kχk1 =

|χn| .

Then, the following holds

kϕk∞ = max

χ

|ϕ(χ)|
kχk1

.

This relation between the norm for internal fores and the norm for internal

virtual displaements is all we need. In fat, the following analysis applies

to other riteria for optimization of the internal fores, i.e., riteria given

by other norms say kϕk. To do this, one should determine the norm on
the spae of internal displaements to whih kϕk is dual, i.e., determine the
norm kχk suh that

kϕk = max

χ

|ϕ(χ)|
kχk

.

Thus, in the sequel we use a generi norm kχk for internal displaements
and the orresponding dual norm kϕk for internal fores satisfying Equation
(3.10). In fat, one the norm kχk is established as the one for whih our

optimality ondition is a dual norm, the norm on the spae of internal dis-

plaement (cid:28)elds (rather than the one on the spae of internal fores) plays

the entral role as will be seen below. It is noted that if the optimality ri-

terion is given in terms of a norm kϕk, the assoiated norm on the spae of

internal displaements an be found by (see [4, p. 186℄)

For external virtual displaements we may also onsider the norm

kχk = max

Contrary to the previous paragraph, we will (cid:28)nd it useful in the analysis

of optimal internal fores below to use for external virtual displaements the

norm

kwk = kA(w)k,

4. APPLICATION TO FINITE ELEMENTS

A typial situation where one would like to apply the foregoing analysis is

a (cid:28)nite element model of a ontinuous body. Thus, we brie(cid:29)y desribe here

some additional details for the simple situation of a (cid:28)nite element model

where it is assumed that the stress is uniform within eah element. We

do not onsider here the question of approximation of the solution to the

ontinuum problem by (cid:28)nite elements and take the (cid:28)nite element model as

a given struture.

Let L be the number of elements, el the l-th element, and σl

ij the om-
ponents of the uniform stress in that element. We want the olletion of σl
ij
for the various elements l and various omponents i, j to be the omponents
of our internal fore vetor. Thus, the index n is replaed by the olletion
of 3 indies l, i, j , ϕl

ij = σl

ij , and

is the quantity that we want to minimize.

The internal degrees of freedom χl

ij should be hosen suh that

is the virtual work of the internal fore for the given internal displaements.

We onsider the following 2-dimensional example. The struture is a (cid:28)nite

element model of a ylinder of inner radius r1 and outer radius r3 under
external normal tration p at the outer boundary (see Fig. 2).

The (cid:28)nite element model onsists of two uniform stress elements e1 and
e2 , orresponding to the regions r1 6 r 6 r2 , and r2 6 r 6 r3 , respetively,
where r2 = (r1 + r3)/2. Due to the ylindrial symmetry the problem has

three degrees of freedom and a typial external virtual displaement is of

(5.9)

As a funtion of w1 , the expression in the urly brakets above is pieewise

a(cid:30)ne and attains its minimum at some point where two adjaent line seg-

ments of its graph meet(cid:22)at some value of w1 where one of the absolute value

terms vanishes. This gives

P =

=

|w2| |A11A22 − A12A21|

,

as evidently |A11| > |A21|. Substituting the values of the various omponents

of the matrix we obtain

P = 2π(r2 − r1) |w2|

We an turn bak to the minimization of Eq. (5.8) where now the minimum

is attained at a value of w2 where one of the two absolute value terms vanishes
or at the value where P vanishes (so w2 = 0). Setting

for the ase A32w2 + A33w3 = 0, we have

For the ase w2 = 0, we have

Q1 = 2π(r3 − r1) |w3| .

It is noted that this value orresponds to a uniform value of σθ that will

This result for a ommon engineering problem ould have been possibly

obtained by diret analysis of the hollow ylinder. However, this example

was aimed at demonstrating the strength of the proposed proedure and

the ability to implement it in real life strutures. Clearly, aside from the

pratial signi(cid:28)ane of knowing the optimal stress that may develop in a

struture under given loading onditions, this proedure an be used to assess

the optimality of a given standard design. Thus, omparing of the maximal

stresses developing in a proposed design with the optimal value obtained by

appliation of the formulation outlined above, one an estimate how muh

the design an be improved.

Let w1 be an element of W − W0 and let W1 be the vetor spae spanned
by W0 and w1 , i.e.,

W1 = {w0 + aw1; a ∈ R, w0 ∈ W0} .

We want to extend F0 to a funtional

F1 : W1 −→ R,

suh that

F1(w0) = F0(w0),
F1(w) 6 kF0kkwk,

for all w0 ∈ W0

for all w ∈ W1.

Assuming F1 satis(cid:28)es the above requirements, then,

F1(w0 + w1) = F1(w0) + F1(w1)
kF0kkw0 + w1k > F0(w0) + F1(w1)

using kF1k = kF0k.

F1(w1) 6 kF0kkw0 + w1k − F0(w0)

for all w0 ∈ W0.

(A.6)

F1(−w0 − w1) = −F1(w0) − F1(w1)
kF0kk − w0 − w1k > −F0(w0) − F1(w1)
kF0kkw0 + w1k > −F0(w0) − F1(w1).

F1(w1) > −kF0kkw0 + w1k − F0(w0)

for all w0 ∈ W0.

(A.10)

We now show that the neessary onditions of Eqs. (A.6) and (A.10) are

also su(cid:30)ient. For any w = w0 + aw1 ∈ W1 we have

F1(w0 + aw1) = aF0(w0/a) + aF1(w1),

(A.11)

using F1(w0) = F0(w0).

right of Eq. (A.11) to get

Now if a > 0, we may use Eq. (A.6) for w0/a in the seond term on the

F1(w0 + aw1) 6 aF0(w0/a) + a (kF0kkw0/a + w1k − F0(w0/a))

= kF0kkw0 + aw1k.

Alternatively, for a < 0, Equation (A.10) may be rewritten as

aF1(w1) 6 −akF0kkw0 + w1k − aF0(w0)

for all w0 ∈ W0.

When we substitute this for w0/a in Equation (A.11) we obtain

F1(w0 + aw1) 6 aF0(w0/a) − akF0kkw0/a + w1k − aF0(w0/a),

= −akF0kkw0/a + w1k,
= kF0kkw0 + aw1k,

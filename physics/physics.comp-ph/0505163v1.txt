Abstract

Eﬀective interaction operators usually act on a restricted model space and give the same energies

(for Hamiltonian) and matrix elements (for transition operators etc.) as those of the original oper-

ators between the corresponding true eigenstates. Various types of eﬀective operators are possible.

Those well deﬁned eﬀective operators have been shown being related to each other by similarity

transformation. Some of the eﬀective operators have been shown to have connected-diagram ex-

pansions. It is shown in this paper that under a class of very general similarity transformations,

the connectivity is conserved. The similarity transformation between hermitian and non-hermitian

Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbative eﬀective operators is one of such transformation and hence the

connectivity can be deducted from each other.

INTRODUCTION

The full Hilbert space time-independent Hamiltonian H can be transformed into an eﬀec-

tive Hamiltonian Heﬀ, which acts on a restricted model space and gives the desirable exact

eigenvalues. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Correspondingly, eﬀective transition operator Oeﬀ is introduced

to give the same matrix elements while acting between the model space eigenstates as the

original transition operator O acting between the corresponding true eigenstates.[1, 3, 7, 8]

The explicit forms of Heﬀ and Oeﬀ are generally much more complicated than those of the

original Hamiltonian H and operator O, which act on the inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space.

Nonetheless, they are important and convenient ab initio computation tools for a variety of

problems. Another general application of them is to give theoretical justiﬁcation to phe-

nomenological Hamiltonian and transition operator,[9] such as those used in f N energy level

and transition intensity calculations.

Heﬀ and Oeﬀ have been widely explored with both perturbative methods (Brillouin-

Wigner scheme, Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger and time-dependent scheme) [1, 2, 10, 11],and non-

perturbative methods, such as iterative schemes and multi-reference open-shell coupled

cluster theories.[12, 13, 14] The results were initially single reference theory [10, 11] and

have been generalized with many eﬀorts to multi-reference cases for both model space and

Fock space.[1, 2, 5, 12, 13, 15, 16] Well deﬁned eﬀective Hamiltonians and operators for

model space are related to the original operators by a similarity transformation.[3] Similar-

ity transformation play very important rules in the derivation of eﬀective Hamiltonian and

is assumed to take certain exponential (normal) forms in coupled-cluster methods, hence the

connectivity of eﬀective operators follows trivially. In perturbative methods, the projected

transformation, i.e., the wave operator, is deﬁned by order by order expansions. Various

eﬀective operators can then be deﬁned with the wave operator and are related to each other

by a class of similarity transformation.[8] In this paper, the connectivity is proved to be

conserved under such transformation. Therefore if one of those eﬀective operators has been

proved to be connected, then the connectivity of all the others follows.

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM AND LEMMAS

Following Lindgren,[2, 17, 19] the eﬀective multi-reference perturbative Hamiltonian for

H = H0 + V , which produces a set of exact eigenvalues, is

H (0)

eﬀ = P HΩP,

(1)

where P is the model space projector, Ω = 1 + χ is the wave operator, which produces exact
eigenstates while acting on the model function (eigenfunction of H (0)

eﬀ ), and χ has nonzero
matrix elements between the space Q and P only, where Q is the orthogonal space of P .

The superscripts (0) is used to distinguish this eﬀective Hamiltonian from others. Such

superscripts is consistent with that of Suzuki et al.[8], which will be used throughout this

paper.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian H (0)

eﬀ is not hermitian and therefore has diﬀerent and non-

orthonormal bra eigenfunctions ( b hΦα

, which can be bi-

orthonormalized and are related to exact eigenstates of H with wave operator, i.e.,

The nonhermitian eﬀective operator Oeﬀ of operator O for this biorthonormal bases is

which has been proved to have connected diagrammatic expansion.[23] The model space

projector can be written with the biorthonormal as

The hermitian eﬀective Hamiltonian and associated hermitian operator [1, 7, 18] are

It can be seen that the hermitian eﬀective Hamiltonian and operator are related to the

nonhermitian ones by a similarity transformation. We will show that the relations between

the eﬀective Hamiltonian and operator and the original Hamiltonian and operator are also

similarity transformations (followed by a projection to model space, which can be avoided).

Deﬁne a transformation operator Tn (arbitrary real n) as

Tn = (1 + χ − χ+)(1 + χ+χ + χχ+)n.

As χ has only matrix elements between Q and P , it can be shown that

and the T −1
n

can be derived with these properties as

χ2 = χ+ 2 = 0,

n = (1 + χ+χ + χχ+)−n−1(1 − χ + χ+).
T −1

It can be seen that T−1/2 is a hermitian transformation. The similarity transformations of

Hamiltonian, eﬀective operator and eigenstates generated by Tn are

is required to diagonalize the transformed Hamiltonian in model space. It can be shown

that it is satisﬁed as follows:

Furthermore,

P ˜HnQ = (Q ˜H−(n+1)P )+ = 0.

As there is no matrix element of ˜Hn between model space and the orthogonal space, the

diagonalization can be done in model space to give exact eigenvalues and model functions.

The eﬀective Hamiltonian for the model space can be simpliﬁed as

H (n)

eﬀ = P ˜HnP

= (P + χ+χ)−n−1(P + χ+)H(P + χ)(P + χ+χ)n

= (P + χ+χ)−n−1(P + χ+)(

eﬀ (P + χ+χ)n

= (P + χ+χ)−nH(P + χ)(P + χ+χ)n.

It can be shown that both T −1

n |Φαi and hΦα| Tn are in model space, which are the ket and
bra model functions respectively. Therefore the eﬀective operator for model space can be
derived by projecting ˜On to model space, i.e.,

O(n)

eﬀ = P ˜OnP

= (P + χ+χ)−n−1(P + χ+)O(P + χ)(P + χ+χ)n.

Such results have been derived by Suzuki and Okamoto[8] in other ways. They showed that

the eﬀective Hamiltonian is related to the origin Hamiltonian by a similarity transformation.

However, the similarity transformation is not suitable for the eﬀective operator. Here a

similarity transformation for both Hamiltonians and operators have been shown. This is

what we have been expected, as Hamiltonian is only a special operator which need be

decoupled. Hereafter we do not distinguish between them and the “operator” refers to both.
Various eﬀective operators ˜On are related to the original operator by similarity transfor-

mation, and therefore are related to each other by similarity transformation, i.e.,

˜On+a = (1 + χ+χ + χχ+)−a ˜On(1 + χ+χ + χχ+)a,
(n+a) = (P + χ+χ)−aOeﬀ

(n)(P + χ+χ)a.

(30)

Such property between operators are very important, since commutation relations, which

are closely related to symmetries, are conserved under similarity transformation.[3]

5

It is well known that the similarity transformation generated by a exponential function

of a connected operator (referred as cluster function) preserve the connectivity, which has

been the bases of coupled cluster methods, i.e.:

If S and O are connected, then exp(−S)O exp(S) is connected.

The proof of this is straightforward by using the famous Campbell-Baker-Hausdorﬀ for-

We will show that the similarity transformation between various perturbative eﬀective

operators generate by (P + χ+χ)a, or (Ω+Ω)a, also preserves the connectivity, i.e.:

Theorem: (Ω+Ω)aO(Ω+Ω)−a is connected if O is connected, where Ω is perturbative wave

operator for complete multi-reference model space. The completeness means that model space

contains all bases which can be formed by distribution the valence electrons among the valence

mulas.

shells.

The following lemmas are used to prove this theorem

Lemma 1. The RS perturbative expansion of the wave operator Ω can be written in a

exponential form, i.e.,

Ω = {exp(S)},

(31)

where the curly brackets mean that the creation and annihilation operators within them are

rearranged into normal form with respect to a closed-shell state. This notation for normal

form will be used throughout this paper. In the case of quasi-degenerate complete model

space, S is a sum of connected diagrams.

Lemma 2. {exp(S1)}{exp(S2)} = {exp(SS1S2)}, where S1, S2 and SS1S2 are all connected.

SS1S2 is the connected part of {exp(S1)}{exp(S2)}.

Lemma 3. xO − Ox = O(1) + (1 − δ)xO(1) + δO(1)x, where x = {exp(S)} − 1, S, O and

O(1) are connected and in normal form, and δ is an arbitrary real number. The order of

O(1) is higher than O by at least one, where the order is the smallest number of V of all the

terms of the operator concerned.

In addition to applying the theorem to show the connectivity of various MBPT eﬀective

Hamiltonians and transition operators, the theorem and lemmas can also be used to show the

connectivity of various eﬀective Hamiltonian in Coupled-Cluster (CC) theories[4, 20, 21, 22].

In those theories various similarity transformations, generated by

to the right and T −1 ( generally 6= {exp(− ˆS)} to the left, have been used to transform

original Hamiltonian operator H or CCSD (CC Singleton and doubleton excited contri-

bution) Hamiltonian operator exp(−T1 − T2)H exp(T1 + T2) into Coupled-Cluster eﬀective

Hamiltonian which have certain zero components convenient for calculation of eigenvalues

and eigenvectors. From the theorem and Lemma 2 it is straightforward to show that all

such transformations preserve connectivity. Moreover, if necessary, more general similarity

transform generated by T a (a an arbitrary number) can be used in CC methods.

III. PROOF OF THE THEOREM AND THE LEMMAS

Lemma 1 has been proved by Lindgren by using factorization theorem and mathematical

induction [2, 17], and Lemma 2 has been proved in another paper[23]. We shall prove the

theorem to be true ﬁrstly by using these lemmas and then prove lemma 3 and lemma 4

afterwards.

A. Proof of the theorem

Denoting x = Ω+Ω − 1 and using the deﬁnition of α(0)(n)

in lemma 4, we have

and the condition β(0)(n)

n

= 0, which follows from lemma 4, has been used in deriving equality

(36). It can be seen from lemma 1 and lemma 2 that the x in (36) can be written as

x = {exp(S)} − 1,

where S is the connected part of exp(S1) exp(S2) that contain only valence creation and

annihilation operators. Applying the δ = 0 case of lemma 3 to (36), we get

We conclude by mathematic induction that Eq. 41 holds for arbitrary m > 0. As O(m) is

connected and its order increases by at least 1 as m increases by 1, we have proved that to
arbitrary large but ﬁnite order, the expansion of (1 + x)aO(1 + x)−a is connected.

B. Proof of lemma 3

A special case of the lemma 4 of [23] is

{exp(S)}O = {exp(S)OL}

= {exp(S)O} + {exp(S)OL
1 }

where OL is the connected part of {exp(S)}O, and OL

1 = OL

1 − O is the connected part of

({exp(S)} − 1)O, whose order is higher than O by at least one.

Denoting x = {exp(S)} − 1, we have

(38)

(39)

(40)

(42)

(43)

(44)

xO = {xO} + {(1 + x)OL

1 }.

Similarly, it can be proved that

Ox = {Ox} + {OR

1 (1 + x)},

where OR

1 is the connected part of Ox, whose order is also higher than O by at least 1.

The lemma 5 of [23], which has been proved, is

{exp(S)O} = {exp(S)}O′,

where S, O and O′ are all connected, and the order of O′ is the same as O.

The following equation can be derived using the latest three equations

xO − Ox = {(1 + x)(OL

1 − OR

1 )}

= (1 + x)O(1),

where O(1) is connected and the order is no less than OL

1 − OR
1 .

The case δ 6= 0 can also be proved with some mathematical manipulation. Note that O(1)

The case m = 0 of Eq. 34 can be proved directly by the binomial expansion of (1+x)a(1+

depends on the value of δ.

IV. CONCLUSION

It has been shown that the perturbative eﬀective Hamiltonian and operator are related to

the original Hamiltonian and operator respectively by the same similarity transformation,

which includes the hermitian special case. Such transformation conserves the commutation

relations and hence most symmetry properties. Various eﬀective Hamiltonians and eﬀective

10

(54)

operators respectively are related to each other by a similarity transformation generated

by {exp S}a, where S is connected, a is an arbitrary real number, and curved bracket

means normal form. An eﬀective Hamiltonian or operator with connected-diagram expansion

will be transformed into a new operator with connected-diagram expansion, consequently

the connectivity can be deduced from each other.

In particular,The hermitian eﬀective

Hamiltonian and operator are related to the simplest non-hermitian eﬀective Hamiltonian

and operator respectively by such a transformation, and therefore are connected from the fact

that the later eﬀective Hamiltonian and operator has been proved to be connected.[23] This

rigorous mathematic proof saves one from understanding the complicated demonstration by

recursive insertion of energy diagrams[1].

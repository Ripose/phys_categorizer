Thermostats are dynamical equations used to model thermodynamic variables such as temper-
ature in molecular simulations. For computationally intensive problems such as the simulation of
biomolecules, we propose to average over fast momentum degrees of freedom and construct ther-
mostat equations in conﬁguration space. The equations of motion are analogous to Smoluchowski
dynamics in the method of stochastic diﬀerential equations. Thus we pose and solve in part the
Kramers problem for the deterministic thermostat method.

One of the most ambitious challenges in mathematical
modeling of biological processes is to describe dynamics
of two major biological events within a cell, the DNA
In both cases,
molecule replication and transcription.
the double-stranded DNA molecule needs to be opened.
The static or average structure of biological molecules
does not entirely determine their function. Dynami-
cal properties, especially large amplitude conformational
changes play a vital part. Modeling of the highly co-
operative slow dynamics of biological molecules is also
relevant to increasingly common single molecule experi-
ments. The principal physical feature of biological func-
tioning of biomolecules is that they operate at ambient
physiological temperature and solvent conditions. Stabil-
ity and function of biomolecules are in ﬁne dependence
on changes in the environment. Thus, simple models
of biological molecules cannot be pure thermodynamical
nor pure dynamical due to the dominating role of the
surrounding physiological solvent, playing among others
the role of a thermostat. It means that the simple dy-
namical models operate by eﬀective collective variables
resulting in a reduced description, in the sense of sta-
tistical mechanics. This suggests that large amplitude
conformational changes of biomolecules are a problem of
non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. To properly ther-
mostat this dynamics, especially on biological (“slow”)
time scale, we propose a suitable and eﬀective tempera-
ture control for both the practice of numerical simulation
and the general theory of dynamical systems.

For a recent and comprehensive review of the problem
outlined above we refer to [1]. Current approaches com-
monly use the Nos´e-Hoover thermostat method (for re-
view see [2]). This canonical thermostat method involves
integration of both position and momentum phase space
variables. However, for problems that are related to slow
conformational changes of biomolecules, integration of
fast momentum variables appears superﬂuous from a the-
oretical point of view as well expensive in the sense of
numerical simulation.

In this Letter, a novel approach to the problem of slow

conformational changes thermostatting dynamics is pre-
sented. The method is based on an analogy with the cor-
responding problem, the Kramers problem, of derivation
of the Smoluchowski dynamics (Eq. (2) below) from the
Fokker-Planck or, alternatively, the Langevin stochastic
diﬀerential equation (Eq. (1) below) [3, 4, 5]. The con-
ﬁgurational deterministic thermostat is constructed so as
to eﬀect the temperature control via certain dynamics of
the relaxation rate variable and also involves dynamically
ﬂuctuated collective force to ensure the ergodicity prop-
erty. As the result, the temperature control is connected
to the speciﬁc conﬁgurational temperature recently intro-
duced in [6, 7] in a diﬀerent context. Moreover, the new
conﬁgurational thermostat can be combined with com-
plementary temperature control via dynamically ﬂuctu-
ated virial function [8] that helps to enhance the eﬃciency
of the thermostat. Besides the conﬁgurational thermo-
stat admits stimulation by the chain rule as well as the
stochastically driven method. To test the new conﬁg-
urational thermostat, corresponding simulation of one-
dimensional harmonic and the Morse oscillator dynamics
is given, providing a stringent test of the ergodicity prop-
erty.

The early and successful attempts to describe dynam-
ics of a mechanical system being in contact with an envi-
ronment playing a role of the thermostat based on con-
cept of the stochastic diﬀerential equation [3]. The case
of one-dimensional motion of a particle mass m in poten-
tial ﬁeld V (q) provides the characteristic example,

dynamic variable, the equilibration variable, instead of
dissipation and random force, we arrive at the Nos´e-
Hoover thermostat [2, 8]. But if the Langevin dynamics
generates all the sample trajectories and the correspond-
ing measure, the Nos´e-Hoover dynamics produces single
sample trajectory with the correct canonical ensemble
statistics when ergodicity holds.

Often details of a system dynamics on short time scales
are not needed dynamical description of observable vari-
ables, e.g., for slow conformational changes of the DNA
molecule. But then the Smoluchowski limit of (1),

where τ = γ−1, is an appropriate formulation [3, 4, 5].
The position variable only is involved in this equation.
Formally, it is supposed that the momentum variable re-
laxes to the local equilibrium state. The corresponding
Smoluchowski equation has the Boltzmann distribution
as the equilibrium solution [3]. Eq. (2), without the
random perturbation, appears as a dissipative dynam-
ics with V (q) playing a role of the Lyapunov function,
˙V =
0. Thus, the full dynamics is super-
position of relaxation to a minimum of the potential and
random perturbations that occasionally expel the system
outside the vicinity of the minimum. This process equi-
librates the system.

It is reasonable, in the spirit of deterministic thermo-
stat methods, to conjecture that it is possible to use the
relaxation time τ for thermostatting conﬁgurational de-
grees of freedom when momentum variables are still re-
laxed to their local equilibrium state. Of course, in this
case the sign of τ is not ﬁxed and V loses its meaning as
a Lyapunov function. In a sense, it means that time can
go back as well as forward.

First, consider the simple dynamical equations,

Now, attempt to generate statistics as in the Nos´e-

equilibrium point
V = 0, that is, all forces are zero,
the evolution grinds to a halt and no longer ﬂuctuates,
irrespective of the time dependence of τ . For initial con-
ditions with nonzero forces (3) after a (positive or neg-
ative) change of time variable, it is a gradient ﬂow as
deﬁned in [9], and it is easy to show that all trajecto-
ries move along paths in q with equilibrium points at
either end. In short, the system is not ergodic. Note also
that (4) is singular when

V = 0.

The way to overcome the diﬃculty is suggested by the
Smoluchowski stochastic equation. In this equation the
ergodic motion is ensured by the random forcing. Hence,
we need to add a deterministic analog of the random force
term in (2). We propose a general equation of the form

∇

m ˙q =

τ

V (q) + ηmq + ξe

(5)

∇

where the η term is suggested by the virial thermostat-
ting scheme [8] and the ξ term is suggested by the con-
stant (i.e. not q dependent) form of the forcing in (2).
Here, e is a constant unit vector of physical (i.e. three
dimensional) space [12]. We could consider only one of
the η or ξ perturbations by a trivial modiﬁcation of (5)
and subsequent equations.

Now we have three parameters which we group to-
gether as a 3-vector α = (τ, η, ξ)T. As in (4) we ﬁnd a
stationary solution of the Liouville equation of the form

where Q is a positive deﬁnite real symmetric matrix.
Note that when multiple thermostats are present they
are usually assumed to be uncoupled (diagonal Q); we
do not feel that this is physically necessary, and consider
that the more general case of coupled thermostats may
be useful. For comparison with the uncoupled case we de-
ﬁne ˜Q = diag(Qτ τ , Qηη, Qξξ) to be the matrix with only
the diagonal components of Q. Eq. (4) now becomes

Let us realize the main conjecture the conﬁgurational
thermostat scheme and allow the components of α to
ﬂuctuate so that (6) holds only after time averaging; we
write

P

where G is as yet an undetermined vector of functions.
Now requiring the same condition for the solution of the
Liouville equation we ﬁnd that the only solution is

˙α = G

G = Q−1 ˜Qg

(7)

(8)

Thus the only undetermined parameters of our ther-
mostatting scheme are the components of the positive
deﬁnite real symmetric matrix Q, and in the uncoupled
case ˜Q = Q we have G = g.

We can now ask whether the addition of new variables
η and/or ξ will remove the lack of ergodicity implied by
the potential ﬂow argument applying to (3). A partial
answer is provided by the Frobenius theorem of diﬀer-
ential geometry [10], which in our case states that an
integral surface exists (hence the dynamics is deﬁnitely
not ergodic) if a vector space containing the terms in
the q equation but smaller than the full phase space is
closed under Lie brackets. For realistic potentials (not
the harmonic oscillator) this is very unlikely since multi-
ple derivatives of V are almost always linearly indepen-
dent. If the theorem does not apply we are in the same
situation as for nonthermostatted nonintegrable many
particle systems, which are often assumed to be ergodic,
at least for practical purposes.

Since under the transformation t

α the
equations of motion (5,7) are still unchanged, they are
time reversible.

To ﬁnd a mechanically important integral of motion of
system (5), we need to add a redundant variable. Indeed,
consider balance of the mechanical work along trajecto-

In that case, the following ﬁrst integral takes place,

IS = V (q) + αTQα/2 + kBT θ.

Since the origin of the redundant variable θ is arbitrary,
it is always possible for an arbitrary ﬁxed trajectory to
set IS = 0. This integral of motion is useful as a control
parameter in numerical simulations. Besides, it clearly
relates to equilibrium distribution ρ∞ and thus can be
considered as a ﬁrst step to reformulation of Eqs. (5)-
(7) in terms of a free energy functional. Recall that the
corresponding Nos´e-Hoover integral of motion [2] is given
by its Hamiltonian; no Hamiltonian is possible here since
the momentum does not appear explicitly.

Since the Smoluchowski dynamics above results in the
Gaussian equilibrium ﬂuctuation of thermostat variables,
the last admits reinforcing by the chain rule analogous
to the Nose-Hoover chain thermostat. The chain rule
method consists in implantation of the subsidiary se-
, into a thermostat

The corresponding dynamics is not unique. Here we have
a clear method for generalizing the chain rule, but since
this does not directly relate to our main topic we do not
discuss the details. Instead we adduce the example of the

It is possible to stimulate the Gaussian ﬂuctuation of
the thermostat variables by the process of Brownian mo-
tion. This scheme has the advantage of ensuring the er-
godicity property. The stimulation, similar to chain one,
may be done in a few ways, applying to one or more of
τ , η and ξ variables. In general we have

where now Λ and √2D are positive deﬁnite real sym-
metric matrices, f (t) is a vector of independent white
noise components. The Liouville equation corresponding
to (10), averaged over all the realizations of f (t), has the
form of the Fokker-Planck equation and the Boltzmann
distribution as a steady state solution only if

kBT Λ = DQ.

We consider that the most physical case is when the noise
is used only for temperature control, that is, for τ and
η only. The chain scheme can be done analogously. We
do not establish extreme generality here because of our
main aim is presentation of the idea of the conﬁgurational
thermostat.

The harmonic oscillator is both a simple and an im-
portant physical system. At the same time, it reveals
the ergodicity problem in the canonical ensemble simu-
lation. For this reason, it is important to test that the
Smoluchowski thermostat method capable of generating
the Boltzmann distribution for a single harmonic oscilla-
tor in one dimension, V (q) = q2/2. Then, it is reason-
able to simulate another one-dimensional system, ‘good’
from point of view of the Frobenius theorem, and to com-
pare results. We set for this purpose the Morse oscilla-

temperature control. The ability of the Smoluchowski
thermostat to reproduce the correct distribution func-
tion, ρ(q), even with absolute minimum of this thermo-
stat capacity, demonstrates its great potential for appli-
cation.

In conclusion, a novel constant temperature thermo-
stat, the Smoluchowski thermostat, involving exclusively
dynamics of the conﬁgurational variables has been in-
troduced. It poses the general problem of derivation of
a thermostatting dynamics for slow dynamical variables
and outlines at least one way of the solution. For practi-
cal purposes, the new thermostatting scheme can easily
be combined with complementary temperature control
via dynamical ﬂuctuation of the virial function. This
combination helps to enhance the eﬃciency of the ther-
mostat temperature control. The chain rule and a novel
stochastic stimulation method also help to enhance the
thermostat eﬃciency, ensure the ergodicity, and appear
as methods of a practical importance. Our current eﬀorts
are focused on applying the Smoluchowski thermostat to
simple, according to [1], models of the DNA molecule
large amplitude conformational dynamics.

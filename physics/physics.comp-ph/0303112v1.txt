Abstract

We introduce a modiﬁed SPH approach that is based on discretising the particle
density instead of the mass density. This approach makes it possible to use SPH
particles with very different masses to simulate multi-phase ﬂows with large dif-
ferences in mass density between the phases. We test our formulation with a simple
advection problem, with sound waves encountering a density discontinuity, and
with shock tubes containing an interface between air and Diesel oil. For all exam-
ined problems where particles have different masses, the new formulation yields
better results than standard SPH, even in the case of a single-phase ﬂow.

Key words: computational ﬂuid dynamics, SPH: smoothed particle

1 Motivation

SPH is a Lagrangian particle method for solving the equations of hydro-
dynamics that was invented by Lucy [1] and Gingold and Monaghan [2].
Instead of discretising space with a grid, the matter is discretised into so-
called particles which move with the ﬂow and do not exchange mass. This
method is especially suited for problems with irregular boundaries. SPH
has been used for many astrophysical problems with great success, and has
also been applied to other ﬁelds of physics, such as e.g. the simulation of
liquids [3] and solids [4] [5].

Due to its Lagrangian nature, simulating several non-mixing ﬂuids is a
straightforward extension to SPH. Each particle gets initially marked with
the phase it belongs to, and these marks do not change with time. Unfortu-
nately, standard SPH as e.g. presented in [6] breaks down at a phase inter-
face when the ﬂuids under consideration have very different mass densi-
ties. We will in the following present a modiﬁcation of SPH that interprets
certain numerical quantities in a different manner [7], leading to a stable
and robust evolution even in this case.

2 Describing multi-phase ﬂows

One commonly used way of introducing the SPH discretisation (see also
e.g. [6]) starts out by considering an arbitrary ﬁeld f (x). This ﬁeld is ﬁrst
smoothed by folding it with a kernel W(x), which leads to the smoothed
ﬁeld

f (x)

f (x)

h

d3x W(x) = 1.
where the kernel W(x) must be normalised according to
One usually chooses kernels that have approximately the shape of a Gaus-
sian, and that have compact support for reasons of efﬁciency. The size of
the domain of support is called the smoothing length and is usually denoted
with the letter h.

R

In the next step, the smoothing integral is discretised at N particle positions
xi, which can in principle be chosen freely, but should of course be “reason-
ably” distributed. This leads to the SPH approximation ˜f (x)

˜f (x) :=

N

of the ﬁeld. The volumes Vj are the discrete counterparts of the volume
element d3x′ in the integral above, and have to be chosen so as to be consis-
tent with the spatial distribution of the particles. It is customary to assign a
certain mass mi to each particle, and then replace the volumes through

Vi =

mi
ρi

where ρi is the discretised mass density assigned to the particle. This is

(1)

(2)

motivated by the fact that the particles do not exchange mass, which leads
to the time evolution equation

d
dt

mi = 0

d

xi = vi

(4)

(5)

(6)

making mi a natural choice for one of the primary variables. In order to
make SPH Lagrangian, the particles have to move with the ﬂow, leading to

as the time evolution equation for the particle positions xi. Here vi is the
discretised ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld.

Assuming that the desired spatial resolution is about the same in all ﬂuid
phases, one would choose similar particle spacings there, leading to similar
particle volumes Vi. If the mass densities in the different ﬂuids are about the
same, no further problems arise, and SPH as usual can be used to describe
them. However, if the difference in mass density is large (say, about one
order of magnitude or more), then the particle masses will differ by the
same factor, leading to problems at the phase interfaces. These problems
are mostly caused by inaccuracies in the mass density. These inaccuracies
are substantial for largely different particle masses. Below we describe how
they come about, and how they can be avoided.

There exist in principle two different methods for obtaining the discretised
mass density ρi in the “standard” SPH formalism. Both start out by con-
sidering the approximate mass density ˜ρ at the particle position xi. This
quantity is obtained from eqn. (2) by choosing f (x) = ρ(xi) and applying
eqn. (3), leading to

the interface, the approximation errors reach a factor of about 2 in the dense region
and about 5 in the thin region.

.

This method is often used for astrophysical problems when there are free
boundaries, i.e. when the matter distribution extends into vacuum. How-
ever, it is not suited for a phase interface with a large density discontinuity.
The smoothing inherent in eqn. (7) will smooth out the density jump over
a region of the size of the smoothing length h in either direction of the dis-
continuity. Particles in this region will then “see” a density that is much
less or much larger from the real density in their phase. When this density
is used to calculate the pressure through the two phases’ equations of state,
the pressure will be very wrong (as shown in ﬁgure 1 for two ideal gases),
and it is basically impossible to set up a stable interface in equilibrium. This
problem becomes even more severe when one of the ﬂuids has a stiff equa-
tion of state, as is the case e.g. in liquids or solids, because then density
inaccuracies will lead to even larger errors in the pressure.

The second method for obtaining the mass density ρi is by integrating ρi in
time via the time derivative of eqn. (7), leading to

where eqn. (5) has been used, and the abbreviation

for ρi can be chosen freely, so that density discontinuities can be modelled.
This can be used to simulate surfaces of liquids and solids.

The problem with this method is similar to the problem encountered when
calculating the density directly from the particle distribution by eqn. (7).

The particles on each side of a phase interface “see”, via the term m j in eqn.
(8), very different particle masses on the other side of the interface. The
values of d/dt ρi then contain large inaccuracies, leading to instabilities at
phase interfaces.

2.2 Modiﬁed SPH

However, eqn. (7) is not cast in stone. An ansatz equivalent to but different
from the one leading to this equation is not to smooth the mass density ρi,
but rather the particle density ni = 1/Vi [7]. This is easily motivated by
the fact that the mass density can be discontinuous over a phase interface,
while the particle density is not, according to our assumption of similar
spatial resolutions on both sides. Smoothing the particle density ni := ˜n(xi)
via eqn. (2) leads to

ni = (cid:229)

Wi j

and by taking its time derivative, the equation

ni = (cid:229)

is obtained after using eqn. (5). As it is customary in SPH to use ρi instead
of ni, we apply eqns. (3) and (4) and arrive at

This new formulation of the equation of continuity is the key element of
our SPH approach. It should be noted that this equation is identical to eqn.
(8) when all particle masses mi are the same, which is the case for many
single-phase SPH simulations.

For the simulations presented in this text, we discretise the Euler and the
internal energy equations in established ways:

3 Tests

In the following we test the new SPH formulation and compare it to an-
alytic solutions as well as simulations performed using standard SPH as
described in [6]. That is, the only difference between these two formula-
tions is that we use eqn. (11) instead of eqn. (8). As test cases, we use an
advection problem, a sound wave encountering a discontinuous change in
the sound speed, and a shock tube with a Diesel–air interface.

3.1 Advection equation

We compare the standard and the new SPH formulation by simulating a
one-dimentional advection equation. That is, we solve the equation of con-
tinuity for the density ρ while prescribing the velocity ﬁeld v. The velocity
proﬁle (which is constant in time) and the initial density proﬁle are given
by

with A = 1.5, x0 = 1, W = 0.4, and q = 0.2. We initially place the parti-
cles with equidistant spacings with a density of n = 10 particles per unit
length and use a smoothing length of h = 0.25. The particle masses are cho-
sen according to the initial density proﬁle at the initial particle positions,
i.e. they differ. Advection problems are particularly well suited test prob-
lems for Lagrangian methods, so we expect a high accuracy from this low
resolution.

The results of simulating this equation with both the standard and the new
SPH formulation are presented in ﬁgure 2, which shows the density ρat ﬁve
different times. Both formulations track the analytic solution very nicely in
spite of the coarse resolution. However, at later times, the standard SPH

peaks, which correspond to later times.

formulation underestimates the density near the peaks, while the new for-
mulation stays much closer to the analytic solution.

3.2 Sound wave

The sound wave test case consists of two regions containing the same ideal
gas, but with different densities and in pressure equilibrium. The density
discontinuity is located at x = 0 with a density ratio of 10 : 1. These condi-
tions also lead to different temperatures, and to sound speeds with a ratio
of 1 : √10. Figure 3 shows an initially Gaussian-shaped sound wave at
different times.

At t =
0.5 the initial wave travels to the left. At t = 0 the wave has
reached the interface where it is partially transmitted and partially reﬂected.
At t = +0.5 the wave consists of two packets, travelling in different direc-
tions with different speeds. The simulation was performed with n = 200
particles per unit length and a smoothing length of h = 0.1. The analytic
solution is shown as dotted line underneath the simulation result. The SPH
simulation with the new equation of continuity (11) tracks the analytic so-
lution quite well. On the other hand, standard SPH using eqn. (8) performs
rather poorly in this case, as can be seen in the graph in the lower right
hand corner: the transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients are wrong, and the
pressure develops spikes at the interface. We assume that the reason for this
is just the one demonstrated in ﬁgure 1.

A further test case for our formulation is a shock tube containing a Diesel–

air to the left and (liquid) Diesel oil to the right. The initial pressure ratio is
2 : 1, the density ratio about 1 : 8. Table 1 lists the exact initial data for this
test case. The shock wave in the Diesel oil travels to the right, the rarefaction
wave in the air to the left. Because the Diesel oil is nearly incompressible,
the ﬁnal pressure is close to the initial pressure of the air. The equation
of state for the Diesel oil was kindly provided to us by the Robert Bosch
GmbH.

The simulation was performed with n = 100 particles per unit length and

a smoothing length of h = 5
sented in [6] with a viscosity coefﬁcient of α = 0.5, because some artiﬁcial
viscosity is necessary to produce entropy in the shock front. This spreads
out the shock front over about 8 smoothing lengths, which is acceptable.

The initial pressure discontinuity remains visible as spikes at the contact
discontinuity. These spikes are caused by the numerical initial data, which
have a discontinuity and hence contain high frequency modes that are not
resolved in the simulation. According to eqn. (1), the initial data should be
smoothed before the SPH formalism is applied. We skip this step because
we want to show that these high frequency modes do not harm the simula-
tions. They remain present, but are not ampliﬁed. The formulation is stable.
Table 2 compares several important quantities of the simulation result to the
analytic solution, showing very good agreement in the shock relations. We
did not manage to perform this simulation with standard SPH.

4 Conclusion

We describe a modiﬁcation to the standard SPH formalism that smoothes
the particle density instead of the mass density. As tested by simulating an
advection equation, sound waves, and shock waves, the new formulation
either yields more accurate results than standard SPH, or the equivalent
simulation with standard SPH is not stable. We conclude that this modiﬁed
SPH formulation is an effective method for simulating multi-phase ﬂows,
and conjecture that this modiﬁcation is beneﬁcial for all simulations where
particles have different masses.

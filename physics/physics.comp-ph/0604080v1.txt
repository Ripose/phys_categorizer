In this work we study the thermodynamic properties of ultrathin ferromagnetic dots using Monte
Carlo simulations. We investigate the vortex density as a function of the temperature and the
vortex structure in monolayer dots with perpendicular anisotropy and long-range dipole interaction.
The interplay between these two terms in the hamiltonian leads to an interesting behavior of the
thermodynamic quantities as well as the vortex density.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetism at nanoscale, when the size of the structure
is comparable to or smaller than both the ferromagnetic
(FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) domain size, oﬀers a
great potential for new physics. In the last decade there
has been an increasing interest in ultrathin magnetic dots
from research groups as well as technological industries.
Such an interest is due to numerous unique phenomena
related to the low-dimension of these systems.

The modern technology demands techniques capable
of producing nanometer-sized structures over large areas.
A good perspective is the use of nanodots of nickel that
could store terabyte of data in a computer chip just a
few centimeters wide. In particular, ferromagnetic nan-
odots have been widely studied by use of experimental
techniques such as MFM (magnetic force microscopy).
In addition, some theoretical models were proposed to
explain the physical phenomena observed in the experi-
ments, among them the transition from perpendicular to
in-plane ordering and the magnetoresistence eﬀect.

Regarding the perpendicular to in-plane ordering tran-
sition, experiments were done using epitaxial ﬁlms to in-

vestigate its transition temperature and thickness depen-
dence [2] [3]. In addition, many theoretical approaches
were developed, for example, treating a two-dimensional
layer by renormalization group [4]. Some lattice models
were proposed to take into account long-range dipolar
interactions and surface anisotropy [5].

Based on such models, Monte Carlo simulations have
been widely used to study the phase diagram of very
thin ﬁlms [6], the nature of this transition [7] as well as
its dependence on the magnetic history of the system [8].
On the other hand, magnetic domains [9] and magnetic
structures [10] have also been investigated by using com-
putational methods. A topological excitation, the spin
vortex, has been found in experiments and also detected
in simulations. Vortex structures are believed to drive a
Bereziinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition
in the two dimensional planar-rotator (PR) model [11].
Although vortices are present in thin ﬁlms with long
range interactions, it is not clear if they play any role
in the transition.

The model we study is described by the Heisenberg
spin hamiltonian with exchange and long-range dipolar
interactions as well as single-ion anisotropy

where we use classical spins |S| = 1. Here the ﬁrst sum is
performed over nearest neighbors with exchange coupling
strenght, J > 0 , while the second sum runs over all spin
pairs in the lattice. The constant of dipole coupling is D,
rik is a vector connecting the i and k sites and A is the
single-site anisotropy constant along the z-axis[5].

The main task in this work is to study the importance
of vortices in the physics of the model. Although
preliminary, our results indicate an anomalous behavior
of the vortex density at the transition temperature

for δ = D
In the following we present a brief
background on the simulation, our results and the
conclusions.

Method

The simulations are done in a square lattice of vol-
ume L × L with L = 20, 40, 60 by using the Monte-Carlo
method with the Metropolis algorithm [12, 13]. Since
nanodots are ﬁnite per nature we have to use open

boundary conditions in our simulations. However, we
want to emphasize the long range eﬀects of the dipolar
term of the model at the boundary of the structure. For
that, we have used periodic boundary conditions in the
non dipolar terms while for the dipolar term we have
used open conditions.

We have studied the model for three diﬀerent values
of the parameters A and D, δ = D
A = 0.1, 1.0 and 9.0 for
ﬁxed J = 1. Energy is measured in units of JS2 and tem-
perature in units of JS2/kB, where kB is the Boltzman
constant. For every temperature the ﬁrst 105 MC steps
per spin were used to lead the system to equilibrium and
the next 105 conﬁgurations were used to calculate ther-
mal averages of thermodynamical quantities of interest.

II. RESULTS

In the case where δ = 0.1, we measured the out-of-
plane (z) and in-plane (xy) magnetizations (Shown in
ﬁgure 1).

ﬁgure 3 and the graphics indicate that the ground state of
the system has a signiﬁcant number of vortices and anti-
vortices in the xy plane. Apparently, the minimum of the
vortex curve is connected with the transition to in-plane
magnetization, however, we were not able to establish
that connection.

FIG. 1: Out-of-plane and in-plane magnetization (open and

The system comes from an ordered state at low tem-
perature to a disordered state at high temperature. That
behavior indicates an order-disorder phase transition at
Tc ≈ 0.55. The in-plane magnetization, Mxy, grows pre-
senting a maximum close to the order-disorder critical
temperature Tc. However, the height of the peak dimin-
ishes as L grows, in a clear indicative that it is a ﬁnite
size artiﬁce.

The magnetic susceptibility is shown in ﬁgure 2. The
position of the maxima give us an estimate for Tc(≈
0.55).

We also measured the vortex density in the xy plane as
a function of the temperature. Starting from the highest
temperature, T = 1.2, the number of vortex decreases
and reaches a minimum. Then it starts to increase as
the system is cooled down. This behavior is shown in

FIG. 3: Vortex density in the xy plane for δ = 0.1.

For δ = 1.0 the behavior of the in-plane and out-
of-plane magnetizations (See ﬁgure 4), suggest that the
ground state is disordered in contrast to earlier works of
Santamaria [6] and Vedmedenko [10] that argue that the
ground state is for spins ordered in the xy plane. A plot
of the susceptibility is shown in ﬁgure 5 as a function of
temperature. Although some authors [6, 10] concluded
that this transition is of second order, the curves show
well deﬁned maxima that do not seem to indicate any
critical behavior.

ﬁgure 6. We see that the number of vortices increases
monotonically from zero as a function of temperature. As
temperature grows we observed that the spins in the lat-
tice start to disorder, so that pairs vortices-anti-vortices
can unbind inducing a BKT transition. However our
results are not reﬁned enough to decide that. In ﬁgure
7 we show two typical conﬁgurations for T = 0.8 and
1.2 where the vortices are indicated by circles and the
anti-vortices by squares.

For systems with larger δ, for example, δ = 9.0, the
spins are preferentially in the xy plane but it does not
present any magnetic ordering (See ﬁgure 8).The vortex
density curve is similar to the case where δ = 1.0 (See
ﬁgure9).

III. CONCLUSION

In summary, we investigated the Heisenberg spin
model with exchange J and dipolar interactions D and
an anisotropic term A for diﬀerent parameters δ = D
A .
For small δ, (0.1), we observed that the vortex density
has a minimum and is non-zero for low temperatures.
Apparently, this minimum is connected with the order-
disorder phase transition but this connection has to be

studied more carefully. For larger values of δ (1.0 and
9.0) the vortex density and the conﬁgurations of vortices
in the system led us to suspect of a phase transition of
the BKT type involving the unbinding of vortices-anti-
vortices pairs. However our results are not reﬁned enough
to decide that.

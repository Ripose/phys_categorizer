Abstract

An eﬃcient geometric integrator is proposed for solving the perturbed Kepler mo-
tion. This method is stable and accurate over long integration time, which makes it
appropriate for treating problems in astrophysics, like solar system simulations, and
atomic and molecular physics, like classical simulations of highly excited atoms in
external ﬁelds. The key idea is to decompose the hamiltonian in solvable parts and
propagate the system according to each term. Two case studies, the Kepler atom
in an uniform ﬁeld and in a monochromatic ﬁeld, are presented and the errors are
analyzed.

Key words: Kepler problem, solar system simulations, Rydberg atoms, symplectic
integration.

1 Introduction

The motion of a body under a force which depends inverse quadratically with
the distance is known as the Kepler problem and explains both the planetary
dynamics and the electronic structure of atoms. The problem is completely
solvable and is a textbook example of constructing action-angle variables for
a nontrivial system. The stable computation of trajectories of perturbed Ke-
pler systems is important for astronomical applications, such as solar system
studies, and in the classical and semi-classical studies of atomic systems, par-
ticularly atoms in highly excited (Rydberg) states. Once the initial conditions

are assigned, the resulting system of ordinary diﬀerential equations can be nu-
merically solved using standard, good-for-all, algorithms such as Runge-Kutta
or Gear integrators. Although such methods have a good control over the local
error, their global error usually grows exponentially. This is why the traditional
numerical methods are unsuitable in treating physical problems which require
long time integration. The simulation of the solar system for more than 109
years [1] is an example where special integration methods are needed [2]. Due
to the weak electromagnetic coupling (of the order of ﬁne structure constant
1/1373) the simulation of the interaction of a Rydberg atom with
cubed
radiation also requires following the electron trajectory for a long time.

Geometric integration is a relatively new branch of the Computational Math-
ematics. It studies algorithms and discretization methods that respect the
underlying geometry and qualitative structure of the the problems it aims to
solve. The principle is that if more speciﬁc information about the problem is
explicitly included into the solver, then the solution will be more accurate and
stable than those produced by generic methods. As a simple illustration, con-
u. This system has
sider the harmonic oscillator problem du/dt = v, dv/dt =

that u2+v2 is a conserved quantity of the evolution. A forward Euler discretiza-
tion of this system with time step h gives un+1 = un + hvn, vn+1 = vn −
hun. It

interval, has lost all three qualitative features listed above!

For a Hamiltonian system, a numerical method is symplectic if it produces an
approximate solution and in the same time it explicitly preserves the underly-
ing symplectic structure. Many symplectic methods also obey other qualities
of the system such as symmetry and time reversal. Although the Hamiltonian
itself is not conserved in general (for autonomous systems), it was demon-
strated that the error grows only linearly in time. Comprehensive reviews of
symplectic methods are presented in references [3] and [4].

Suppose that the Hamiltonian is separable and each term in the separation
deﬁnes an integrable problem, then a symplectic solution is obtained by propa-
gating the system with each term separately. The symplectic quality is evident
since the composition of two symplectic maps is also symplectic and the solu-
tion is exact in the limit of vanishing time step. The traditional way is to split
the Hamiltonian as the kinetic energy T plus potential energy V . Evolution
under the kinetic energy part alone describes the free motion of the system.
The potential energy term usually does not depend on momentum coordinates
and therefore the position coordinates remain unchanged during propagation
with it. The system gets a ”kick”, a sudden change in momentum. It was
proved (see [3], for example) that the leap-frog, or St¨ormer-Verlet, methods,
very popular in Molecular Dynamics simulations, can be derived from a T + V

2

splitting and are therefore symplectic. Essential for a more general way of
splitting the Hamiltonian is that the parts are not only integrable but also
eﬃciently computable.

This paper proposes a symplectic integration method for perturbed Kepler
problems by splitting the Hamiltonian into a pure, exactly solvable, Kepler
part and a perturbation part. Even when the perturbation is not small, the
system can be propagated with accuracy using relatively large time steps.
This method can be applied for all problems where such a decomposition
makes sense. For a collision problem, such as electron scattering on an atom,
this splitting is not practical when the projectile and target electrons come
close to each other and interact strongly. In such a case the time step has to
be chosen very small so that trajectories are straight lines (during one time
step) and this method is no more eﬃcient than the simpler T + V splitting.
Although the algorithm is still correct, the advantage of being able to take
large time steps is lost.

Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the eﬃciency of the proposed
method. Interaction of a Rydberg atom with an uniform external ﬁeld is stud-
ied in both cases. One case treats the interaction with a constant ﬁeld (Stark
eﬀect) and the other with that of a monochromatic oscillatory ﬁeld (laser
interaction).

2 Symplectic propagator

The motion of a planet or of a Rydberg electron can be described by the
classical equations of motion derived from the Hamiltonian

where H0 = p2/2
1/r (in an appropriate set of units) is the Kepler Hamilto-
nian and V is the perturbation potential. The evolution in time of any function
z deﬁned over the phase space is given by the general equation

are the Poisson brackets and DH is an operator deﬁned by the
where
Hamiltonian H. Providing the initial condition z0 at t0, the function z is
obtained at time t as a solution of the above equation, given as z(t) = Φ∆t(z0).
Formally, the mapping Φ can written as Φ∆t = e∆tDH , in a form reminiscent
of the quantum mechanical evolution operator. Of course, the exponential of

3

operator DH has an exact meaning only if the solution of the Hamiltonian H is
explicitly known. Apparently no real advantage is gained. However, solutions
for H0 and V are separately known, and, for any ∆t, the mapping associated
with these solutions are e∆tDH0 and e∆tDV . If the phase space operators DH0
and DV commute (or their Poisson bracket
= 0) then the product of
exponentials is equal to the exponential of their sum, and the problem has an
exact solution: Φ∆t = e∆tDH0 e∆tDV . This is not the case in general, and the
following useful expansion can be derived from the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ
formula

The Poisson bracket also has the property of being a Lie brackets which means
that [DX, DY ] = D{Y,X}.

−

The meaning of the expansion formula (1) is that the propagator obtained by
successive application of eλA/2, eλB and eλA/2 is a propagator of an equivalent
Hamiltonian ˜H equal to the original H = A + B, only in the limit of λ
0.
For a small enough time step λ, the exact solution under ˜H is expected to
converge to a solution of H. This propagator is symplectic and also preserves
the symmetry, time reversibility and ﬁrst order invariants of the system. When
the perturbation V does not depend on time then both Hamiltonians H and
˜H are conserved. Therefore the global deviation from energy conservation is
directly accessible from ˜H - H. This is a valuable asset of the symplectic
methods, since most good-for-all integration methods cannot easily predict
the global behavior of their solutions, in general.

The truncation error for the T + V splitting is still second order in the time
step, but is clearly inferior at small distance r, where it behaves as 1/r4

Formula (1) suggests a couple of ways to improve the performance of this
method. First, if operator B is replaced by B′ = B +λ2/24 [A+2B, [A, B]] and
providing the the evolution under B′ is explicitly known, then the λ3 term in
expansion is removed and the error is now of the order of λ5. The second way of
accelerating the convergence is obtained by adapting the times step. Superior
order methods are obtained by composing steps with appropriate variable time
steps. Examples of such schemes are presented in the next section.

A solution of the pertubed Kepler problem is therefore obtained by evolving
the phase space point (r, p) of the system successively, under two elementary
operations. The “drift stage” is the evolution under the Kepler Hamiltonian
H0, while the evolution under the perturbation Hamiltonian V is called the
“kick stage”.

2.1 Drift stage

Although a textbook example, an explicit solution of the Kepler problem is not
entirely trivial. To state the problem, given the position r0, and momentum
p0 at time t0, one need to ﬁnd positon r and momentum p at some other time
t0 + ∆t. This mapping denoted by D(∆t), gives the position and momentum
along a Keplerian orbit, from an initial position and momentum, after a time
∆t.

The trajectory during the drift stage is a segment of an ellipse, a parabola or
a hyperbola, depending whether the “local” energy w = H0 = p2/2
1/r is
positive, zero or negative, respectively. The geometric size of the ellipse and

the orbital period also depend on the local energy. The angular momentum
L = r
(rp) p vectors, are used to
identify the orientation of the orbital plane in space. Although w, L and A can
be calculated from the initial state vector (r0, p0), it is advantageous to keep
these quantities in the state vector, alongside with position and momentum.
This helps save a number of ﬂoating point operations. Besides it can also
help avoid the accumulation of round-oﬀ errors that might creep up in the
calculation. For instance the energy is sometimes obtained as a diﬀerence of
two large numbers: the kinetic and potential energies.

−

Having as input the thirteen dimensional state vector (r, p, w, L, A), the drift
stage proceed as follows:

(1) obtain the characteristic parameters of the orbit: semimajor axis a =
)3/2,
(2) calculate the direction of the pericenter ˆe1 = A/ǫ and the direction in

(6) energy, angular momentum and Runge-Lenz vectors are not modiﬁed

during the drift stage.

The steps above apply speciﬁcally to the case of negative energy (elliptic orbit).
It is not diﬃcult to generalize this procedure for the parabolic and hyperbolic
motions.

Up to round-oﬀ errors, the drift stage integrates exactly the orbit for any time
step ∆t, except for the solution of the transcendental Kepler’s equation which
has to be obtained approximately. However, this equation has been long and
carefully studied, as Goldstein remarks [5]:

Indeed, it can be claimed that the practical need to solve Kepler’s equation
to accuracies of a second of arc over the whole range of eccentricity fathered
many of the developments in numerical mathematics in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. A few of the more than 100 methods of solution devel-

6

oped in the pre-computer era are considered in the exercises to this chapter.

2.2 Kick stage

In the kick stage the system evolves solely under the perturbation Hamiltonian
V . This mapping is denoted by K(∆t). If V does not depend on momentum,
then the position vector is a cyclic coordinate and does not change during this
stage. The change in momentum can then be explicitly obtained as

Where F is the perturbation force derived from the potential V . Quantities
w, L and A in the state vector are updated from r, p and ∆p, instead of
calculating them directly from r and p′. This precludes the accumulation of
round-oﬀ errors and increases the eﬃciency of the procedure. For example,
energy is updated during the kick stage as

w′ = w + p∆p +

2.3 Kepler solver

The solution of the transcendental Kepler’s equation is the most time con-
suming part in the propagator. The traditional numerical scheme to obtain
accurate solutions is to “guess” a good starting approximation and then reﬁne
it by using Newton-Raphson iterations until the desired accuracy is obtained.
Each iteration involves evaluating trigonometric functions several times. Since
each trigonometric function evaluation has a cost of at least several hundreds
of microprocessor clocks, regardless if it is done “on-the-chip” or by a library
call, the cost of solving the Kepler’s equation can mount easily to thousands
of clocks. It is clear that a long time integration, on the order of 108 time steps
would require a more reﬁned procedure. A table-driven procedure is proposed
here, which trades memory space in favor of time. No trigonometric functions
are calculated during iterations.

The Kepler solver takes two branches, depending whether the orbit is elliptic

(3) for the “regular” cases, a grid is set up for the (0, π) interval with points
uk = kπ/ng, k = 0, . . . , ng and a table of sine and cosine at the grid
points is stored at the start of the program. From an initial grid index
guess u = M, a Newton-Raphson iteration for indices is started using
the following mapping: k

Ξ is a function returning the integer truncation of a real number, and
sk and ck are the sine and cosine values at the grid point k. At the end
of this process the solution is localized between two grid points with an
accuracy no greater than the grid spacing π/ng. In this way, the process
has both the quadratic convergence of Newton-Raphson’s method and
the stability of bisection method.

(4) A last ﬁfth-order Newton-Raphson reﬁnement is obtained using the grid
point closest to the solution obtained at the previous step. However, in-
stead of searching for a u value which satisﬁes Eq. (3), it is more eﬃcient
to look for a solution in the unknown tan(u/2). This procedure deliv-
ers then directly the pair (sin u, cos u) corresponding to the solution, and
hence no trigonometric function need to be explicitly calculated during
the procedure call! Assuming that the values of the function f0 and of
the ﬁrst four derivatives f1, f2, f3 and f4 are known at the grid point,
then the following corrections are obtained

A similar approach is taken to solve Eq. (4). Although Kepler’s equation for
positive energy is not manifestly periodic, a mapping to the standard interval
is obtained by observing that Eq. (4) can be written as ǫ1eu
M = 0
and that the following set of transformations

leave this form invariant. In this way, the equation needs to be solved only in
the standard interval [0, D) where D is arbitrary. For convenience, D is chosen
D = 2.0. This interval is gridded and the exponential ek = exp uk is calculated
at each grid point k. The Newton-Raphson grid iteration

k

k′ = k + Ξ[(M + uk −

ǫ1ek −

ends by identifying the grid point closest to the solution. The solution for eu is
obtained from this grid point after a ﬁfth order Newton-Raphson reﬁnement.
This subroutine returns an approximation for the (sinh u, cosh u). Precision
levels similar to the elliptic case are obtained.

When tables of sine, cosine and exponential are build at the set up of the pro-
gram, the drift stage can then be performed without evaluation of any tran-
scendental function, which brings signiﬁcant improvements to the eﬃciency of
the integrator.

3 Applications

3.1 Kepler atom in uniform electric ﬁeld

In the absence of a perturbation, the kick stage reduces to identity and the
dynamics is described only by the drift. The propagator was tested and the
solution was seen to be practically exact (within the machine precision) even
for extremely long time integration. A proper test of this symplectic integrator
can only be done in the presence of a perturbation. The simplest perturbation,
which is also completely integrable, is the constant and uniform force ﬁeld.

When a constant force F acts on the system, the Kepler orbit orbit starts to
rF,
precess and change its eccentricity. The corresponding potential is V =

Figure 1 compares the performance of step2 integrator with a standard implicit
Runge-Kutta method of order 4, with adaptive time step (rk4imp), from the
free GNU Scientiﬁc Library (GSL) [6]. The initial orbit has eccentricity 0.9,
energy -0.5 and period 2π in the chosen units. An uniform electric ﬁeld of
10−3 is applied along a direction perpendicular to the orbital
magnitude 5.5
plane. If the initial orbit represents a ground state hydrogen atom, then the
107 V/cm. Because of the scaling of the classical equations
electric ﬁeld is 2.86
of motion, this would also simulate a n = 100 Rydberg atom in a ﬁeld of
intensity 2.86 kV/cm. The trajectory is simulated for about 4000 orbits, until
105 steps of constant size π/100
time 25000. The step2 subroutine takes 8
106 steps and
and ﬁnishes the jobs in 0.7 seconds, while irk4imp makes 7.6
takes 9.6 seconds to complete. The precision and accuracy parameters are set
to 10−5. Although the standard Runge-Kutta integrator runs ten times longer
and makes ten times more steps, the relative error for the energy conservation
increases. The performance of step2 are initially worse than irk4im, but the
accumulation of errors is much slower. The long time integration advantages
of the symplectic method are clear.

As shown by Eqs. (5) and (6), when the electric ﬁeld is oriented parallel to
the orbital plane, the trajectory goes to a singular orbit with L = 0 and
unit eccentricity, and the particle goes through the Coulomb center. The error

accumulates at much higher rate for the standard Runge-Kutta integrator;
every time the singularity is encountered, the error increases at least one order
of magnitude. A fragment of a trajectory having this kind of singularity is
shown in ﬁgure 2. Owing to the built-in exact Kepler solution, the symplectic
integrator is able to advance through this singularity with no catastrophic
consequences. At very small distances, the central Coulomb force is much more
stronger than the external ﬁeld and the dynamics is practically governed by
the drift stage alone. In order to cope with such extreme situations, the basic
step2 integrator can be improved in several ways.

Higher order integrators can be obtained by compounding more stages dur-
ing one time step. Following [7], a fourth order step4 integrator is obtained
using the following symmetric sequence: K1D1K2D2K2D1K1, which uses only
three drift stages. Here the following notation is used: K1,2 = K(a1,2∆t) and
D1,2 = D(a1,2∆t). A sixth order (step6) stepping procedure is obtained by
using an appropriate combination of elementary step2 steps. For example [7],
the following sequence S3S2S1S0S1S2S3 has an error of order 6 in the time
step, is symmetric and time reversible. Here S0,1,2,3 means step2 steps with
∆t. The coeﬃcients w0,1,2,3 are solutions of a nonlinear

order equation which ensure that all errors up to order 6 are canceled. The
numerical coeﬃcients used in these higher order integrators are listed in Table
1.

As expected, higher order integrators have the error decreasing faster with
decreasing time steps. However, this behavior is evident only when the time
step is smaller than a critical time step, which decreases with increasing eccen-
tricity. For eccentricity 0.9, the advantage of higher orders is manifest only for
time steps smaller than 10−2, for example. In order to understand this feature
it is enough to consider the leading terms of expansion (1) in evaluating the
global error:

ǫ = 0.9 one gets λ < 0.07, roughly in agreement with the results presented
in Fig. 3. The error saturates around 10−12 because of the limited precision
imposed by the Kepler solver. A ﬁner grid in the Kepler solver improves this
precision.

The error in energy for the basic integrator step2 becomes unbounded in the
case of a ﬁeld parallel to the orbital plane, as the eccentricity becomes unity
with a period given by 4π/3F . Another way of improving the basic integrator
step2 is to use an adaptive time step strategy. The singularity is removed from
the ﬁrst term in Eq. (7), and weakened for the second one, if the time step
λ is adaptively chosen proportional to distance r as λ = ηr. Figure 4 shows
the results using this strategy (stepA). The electric ﬁeld has a strength of
π/600 so that that orbit become singular with a period of 800, as predicted.
Eccentricity, as plotted in the lower graph in Fig. 4, is initially 0.2. The energy
conservation is bounded, in general, and has spikes whenever eccentricity goes
to 1 and the orbit becomes one dimensional, because of the λ4 (and higher)
energy correction which dominates in these cases. In contrast, the implicit
Runge-Kutta (rk4imp) shows a catastrophic accumulation of error after the
ﬁrst encounter with singularity, even though the precision and the accuracy
parameters are set at 10−8 and about 106 steps are taken for the segment shown
in ﬁgure. About the same number of steps are taken by stepA to integrate the

3.2 Kepler atom in monochromatic time dependent ﬁeld

Time dependent ﬁelds can be taken into account by using a canonical trans-
formation which adds time as a position coordinate to the Hamiltonian (see
for example [8]). Therefore, only during the drift stage the time variable is ad-
vanced. The time dependent external force does work on the system and the
energy is not conserved. However, when the work is subtracted, the quantity

is conserved, and can be used to quantify the precision level of the integrator.

4 Conclusion

The integration of the orbit of a particle having a perturbed Keplerian motion
can take advantage of the explicit integrability of the Kepler problem. Splitting
the Hamiltonian as a Kepler part plus a perturbation, as opposed to the more
general kinetic plus potential energy splitting, has clear advantages, especially
for long time integration.

The overall eﬃciency of this method is limited by how fast the transcendental
Kepler equation can be solved. By using a table of pre-calculated trigonometric
and exponential functions, and a ﬁfth order Newton-Raphson reﬁnement, a
fast and reasonably accurate Kepler solver is successfully used.

The convergence of the second order, basic integrator step2, can be improved
to obtain fourth order step4 and sixth order step6 symplectic schemes. A time
adaptive step stepA has been proved to have excellent energy conservation
for long time integration, when the trajectory goes repeatedly through the
Coulomb singularity, in the case of an uniform constant ﬁeld in the orbital
plane. Time dependent problems can also be solved using a variant (stepT) of
the basic step, as demonstrated for a monochromatic ﬁeld.

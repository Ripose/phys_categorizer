Analytical Hartree-Fock gradients with respect to the cell parameter have been implemented in
the electronic structure code CRYSTAL, for the case of one and two-dimensional periodicity. As
in most molecular codes, Gaussian type orbitals are used to express the wavefunction. Examples
demonstrate that the gradients have a good accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION

Analytical gradients1–7 have become a standard tool
in molecular quantum chemistry. They are indispensable
for the optimization of structures, and many properties
can be eﬃciently computed with the help of analytical
derivatives. The ﬁeld was pioneered by Pulay8; the the-
ory had already been derived earlier independently9.

The traditional quantum chemical methods are dif-
ﬁcult to apply to solids because of the large increase
of the computational eﬀort with the system size. Af-
ter several decades of development, Hartree-Fock calcu-
lations for solids can nowadays be routinely performed
with the CRYSTAL code10,11. Although Hartree-Fock
calculations often have large errors due to the neglect of
electronic correlation, a large interest has grown in the
past few years due to the success of hybrid functionals
which include an admixture of exact (Fock) exchange.

Analytical gradients in the CRYSTAL code were ﬁrst
implemented with respect to nuclear positions12,13, and
after the implementation of a scheme for geometry opti-
mization, an eﬃcient structural optimization could be
performed14.
In periodic systems, the cell parameter
is another variable to be optimized. The ﬁrst gradi-
ents with respect to the cell parameter, at the Hartree-
Fock level, were for systems periodic in one dimension15.
Various groups have implemented these gradients in one
dimension16,17 (see also the recent review article18) or
in two dimensions19. For the general case, a strategy to
compute cell parameter derivatives (and thus the stress
tensor) was suggested with point charges20, and an al-
gorithm for structural optimization, based on redundant
internal coordinates was proposed21. Second analytical
derivatives with respect to the cell parameter have also
been implemented recently22.

A ﬁrst big step of the corresponding implementa-
tion in the CRYSTAL code were analytical Hartree-

1

Fock gradients with respect to the cell parameter in
three dimensions23.
It is important to note that the
CRYSTAL code is based on the Ewald24,25 method in
three dimensions, so that computing analytical gradi-
ents with respect to the cell parameter requires vari-
ous additional derivatives:
for example the reciprocal
lattice vectors depend on the cell parameter, and var-
ious others. This requires additional derivatives which
were not yet available with the implementation of nu-
clear gradients, and this has been documented in great
detail23. The one and two-dimensional case are again dif-
ferent because diﬀerent potentials are used: Parry’s po-
tential in two dimensions26,27, and Saunders’ potential in
one dimension28. Parry’s potential is similar to Ewald’s
potential, but modiﬁed for the case of two dimensions.
Saunders’ potential relies on a real space approach.

This article is intended to complement the ﬁrst article
on cell gradients23. Many parts have already been de-
scribed in the ﬁrst article, and therefore the main empha-
sis is to delineate the diﬀerences due to the dimension-
ality. The article consists thus of one section about the
general diﬀerences to the three-dimensional case, one sec-
tion about the two-dimensional case, one section about
the one-dimensional case, and one section with examples.

II. GENERAL DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT
TO THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL CASE

The main diﬀerence to the three-dimensional case is
the way how the Coulomb energy is computed. The ex-
pression to be evaluated is the Coulomb energy per cell:

Ecoul =

d3r

d3r ′ρ(~r)Φ(~r

with Φ being the potential function corresponding to
three dimensions (Ewald’s potential function)24,25, two
dimensions (Parry’s potential function)26 or one dimen-
sion (Saunders’ potential function)28.

ρ(~r) is a cellular charge distribution, composed of the

nuclear charges Za at the positions of the nuclei ~Aa,

The basis functions φµ(~r

~g) are real spheri-
cal Gaussian type functions, Pν~gµ~0 is the density matrix
in real space. ~Aµ denotes the nucleus where the basis
function µ is centered. The implementation is done for
the case of closed shell Hartree-Fock and unrestricted
Hartree-Fock methods. For the sake of simplicity, the

2

spin is ignored in the equations in this article. The ex-
tension is straightforward, as was shown for the three-
dimensional case23. Examples for spin-polarized calcula-
tions are given in section V.

The potential function enters via the nuclear-nuclear
repulsion (equation 10 in reference 23), the nuclear at-
traction integrals (equation 34 in reference 23), and the
ﬁeld integrals (equation 43 in reference 23). Essentially,
the derivatives are computed as described in the previous
article23, there are only minor diﬀerences as described in
section III and IV.

The derivatives of the other integrals (overlap, kinetic
energy, multipoles, bielectronics) and the calculation of
the energy-weighted density matrix is practically identi-
cal to the three-dimensional case23.

Finally, the correction due to the spheropole (equation
47 in reference 23) is zero in one and two dimensions and
thus does not have to be discussed. The spheropole is a
correction which arises due to the Ewald method, when
applied to the electronic charge distribution: the charge
distribution is approximated by multipoles in the long
range, and not approximated in the short range. The
electrostatic potential is then computed as the sum of the
Ewald potential of the multipoles and of the Coulomb
potential of the charge distribution in the short range.
Replacing the Ewald potential with the Coulomb poten-
tial is correct, if the diﬀerence of multipolar charge dis-
tribution and the exact charge distribution in the short
range, has zero charge, dipole, quadrupole, and second
spherical moment25. The second spherical moment can
also be seen as the average electrostatic potential of a
charge distribution (see the discussion in section 3.2 of
reference 25). Here, it corresponds to the average elec-
trostatic potential of the diﬀerence of the exact and the
approximated charge distribution. This term is ﬁnite and
in general non-zero, in the case of periodicity in three di-
mensions. However, when the system has periodicity in
less than three dimensions, the average electrostatic po-
tential of a charge distribution with zero total charge,
dipole and quadrupol, is zero. Therefore, there is no
spheropole in less than three dimensions.

This can also seen from equation 31 in reference 25.

The average Coulomb potential is obtained as follows:

Φ =

2π
3Vcell Z

−

ρdif f (~r) ~r2 d3r

(4)

ρdif f (~r) corresponds here to the diﬀerence between the
exact charge distribution and the multipolar charge dis-
tribution. The integral is over the whole space and ﬁ-
nite. The prefactor involves a division by the cell volume
Vcell of the three-dimensional cell. We might now ap-
proximate a system with periodicity in two dimensions
by a system of slabs with three-dimensional periodicity,
where the slabs are separated by a vacuum region. When
we increase the vacuum region and thus the cell volume
Vcell, then the integral remains essentially constant, but
the prefactor becomes smaller and smaller and therefore

the average Coulomb potential becomes zero, and the
spheropole correction becomes zero.

It should be mentioned, that two-dimensional period-
icity is implemented in the CRYSTAL code in such a
way that there is only one slab which is not repeated in
the third dimension. Still, the argument presented above
holds in a similar way, and there is thus no spheropole
correction in systems with less than three-dimensional
periodicity.

The total energy is

to the three-
thus
dimensional case23, apart from the spheropole term
which is zero:

the Fock exchange Eexch−el. The variables will not all
be explained in order to reduce the number of formu-
las in this article. The reader is referred to the article
on the three-dimensional case for the details where all
these terms are explained23. The gradient with respect
to the cell parameters aij is given in the following equa-
tion. As the total energy, the gradient is similar to the
three-dimensional case apart from the spheropole term
which is zero.

III. THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL CASE

In the two-dimensional case, the primitive cell is given
by two vectors, with two components: ~a1, ~a2. aij are
deﬁned in such a way that a11 = a1x is the x-component
of ~a1, a12 = a1y the y-component of ~a1, a21 is the x-
component of ~a2, and a22 is the y-component of ~a2.

A point ~g of the direct lattice is deﬁned as ~g = n1~a1 +
n2~a2, with n1, n2 being integer numbers. The position of
an atom c in a cell at the origin (i.e. ~g = ~0) is given as
~Ac = fc,1~a1 + fc,2~a2, and then in cell ~g the position will
be:

~Ac + ~g = (fc,1 + n~g,1)~a1 + (fc,2 + n~g,2)~a2
We have used an additional index, i.e. n~g,1 means fac-
tor n1 of the lattice vector ~g. The cartesian t component
(with t being x or y) of the vector ~Ac + ~g, indicated as
Ac,t + gt, is thus

~h are the direct lattice vectors, ~K the reciprocal lattice

γ is a screening parameter which was optimized to be
γ = (2.4/V 1/2)2, in the two dimensional case. Note that
this is diﬀerent to the three-dimensional case25 where
γ was chosen as γ = (2.8/V 1/3)2. The prime in the
direct lattice summation indicates that the summation
includes all values of the direct lattice vector ~h, with the

The error function erf is deﬁned as in reference 23,

equation 12.

Like the Ewald potential, Parry’s potential depends
on the variables ~Ac , ~h, V , γ and ~K. The derivative
with respect to the cell parameters thus requires deriva-
tives with respect to these variables. For the deriva-
tives with respect to ~Ac and ~h this is like in the three-
dimensional case. There are minor changes due to the
two-dimensionality for the derivatives of the area V , of
the ~K-vectors with respect to aij and of the screening
parameter γ.

1. Derivative of the area

The area is obtained as the magnitude of the cross

product of the cell parameters:

Essentially, the formulas for the three-dimensional case
can be used, when setting a1z = 0, a2z = 0 and
~a3 = (0, 0, 1). This holds also for the derivatives of the
reciprocal lattice vectors, as described in the following
paragraph.

2. Derivative of the reciprocal lattice vectors

The reciprocal lattice vectors ~K can be expressed as

~K = n1~b1 + n2~b2

(15)

with the primitive vectors ~bi of the reciprocal lattice

deﬁned as:

As a whole, Parry’s potential leeds to similar terms
appearing in the derivatives as in the case of the Ewald
potential. This is what was to be expected, as Parry’s
potential is essentially obtained when Ewald’s approach
to treat the Coulomb interaction is applied to a system
with two-dimensional periodicity.

IV. THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL CASE

In the one-dimensional case, there is only one cell pa-
rameter: axx = a11 = a =
. This case is somewhat dif-
~a
|
|
ferent from the two- and three-dimensional case because
a pure real space approach is used in the CRYSTAL code
for the potential to describe the Coulomb interaction28.
The potential consists of a point charge +1, neutralized
by a uniform charge distribution of length a, with charge
1
density
a . The uniform charge distribution is then
again compensated. Up to a certain range, the sum-
mation is performed exactly. For larger distances, the
summation is instead approximated with the help of the

−

7

Euler-MacLaurin summation rule. As a whole, the fol-
lowing expression was obtained28:

z, α) + H(U + z, α)

−

a

+ ξ(M, ~r) + ξ(M,

~r) (26)

−

−

−

−

n~a
|

The ﬁrst term comprises the exact part, the next two
(with the H function) the region due to the uniform
charge density in the range of the exact sum (from
M~a
to M~a), the remaining two terms (the ξ-function) are the
approximated part. The prime indicates that terms with
= 0 are omitted. M is thus the number of cells,
~r
|
where the sum is performed exactly, and U = a(M + 1
2 ).
α is deﬁned as α = x2 + y2, with ~r = (x, y, z). H is
p2 + α + p). ξ(M, ~r) and
the function H(p, α) = ln(
ξ(M,
~r) are contributions from the long range part,
p
which is approximated by the Euler-MacLaurin rectange
rule summation formula. For more details, see reference
28. For the present purpose, it is important to note that
the direct lattice vector a appears in the potential, but
no screening parameter γ and no reciprocal lattice vec-
tors ~K as in the two- and three-dimensional case. This
means that derivatives with respect to the nuclear co-
ordinates ~Ac and derivatives with respect to the direct
lattice vectors n~a appear, which are essentially given by
the nuclear gradients, multiplied with the fractional co-
ordinates. The derivatives with respect to a due to the
H and ξ function are very lengthy, but still straightfor-
ward. They are thus not discussed here, but formulas
can be derived from Saunders’ article28.

V. EXAMPLES

In this section, we give some numerical examples of the
accuracy of the gradients. The tests considered are es-
sentially identical or similar to the test cases distributed
with the CRYSTAL code and with the ones from ref-
erence 14. Note that the fractional coordinates of the
atoms were not optimized.

First, two systems with one-dimensional periodicity
are considered. In table I, SN is periodically arranged.
The analytical and numerical derivative agree well up to 4
digits, and the minimum of the energy at a=4.42 ˚A agrees
with the place where the gradient changes its sign. In ta-
ble II, such a comparison is done for polyglycine. The
agreement of numerical and analytical gradients is simi-
lar to SN, and again the vanishing of the gradient agrees
with the minimum of the energy, to at least 0.01 ˚A. In
table III, ferromagnetic NiO is studied at the level of
unrestricted Hartree-Fock. The agreement of numerical
and analytical gradient can be improved by increasing the
”ITOL”-parameters11, as described earlier12,23. Indeed,
when increasing them from default values to higher ones,
symmetric in ITOL4 and ITOL5, then analytical and nu-
merical gradient match better. Note that, when running
at lower ITOL parameters, an inaccuracy is introduced

8

in the total energy expression and thus in the numerical
gradients as well. The fact that numerical and analyti-
cal gradients match less well at low ITOL values is thus
a combination of an inaccuracy in the energy expression
(which aﬀects the numerical gradient) and an inaccuracy
in the analytical gradient. Still, in all the tests performed
so far, no severe error was found when using default val-
ues for the ITOL parameters. Using higher ITOL pa-
rameters is mainly useful for tests of the correctness of
the code.

Then, various systems with two-dimensional periodic-
ity are considered. In table IV, 3 MgO layers are con-
sidered. Numerical and analytical derivative agree to 3
digits, and the minimum of the energy and the vanish-
ing of the gradient agree also well. The same accuracy is
found for Al2O3 in table V, where a slab with 6 atomic
layers is considered. In table VI, a Cr2O3 slab was chosen
as an example for unrestricted Hartree-Fock. The accu-
racy is slightly worse when comparing the numerical and
the analytical gradient. This can again be improved by
increasing the ”ITOL”-parameters. The minimum in the
energy agrees already with default ”ITOL” values to at
least 0.01 ˚A. Finally, in table VII, LiF was arranged with
two dimensional periodicity, without symmetry, in such
a way that three components of the cell gradient (a1x,
a1y, a2y) can be computed independently. This test thus
demonstrates that these components are correctly com-
puted.

In table VIII, the CPU times are displayed. The cal-
culations were performed on a single CPU of a Compaq
ES45, with a clock rate of 1 GHz. As in the three-
dimensional case, we compare again the CPU time for
the integrals with the time for the gradients. The CPU
time for all the gradients (nuclear and cell gradients) is
roughly ﬁve to ten times the CPU time for the integrals.
This may become smaller in the future with further opti-
mizations in the gradient code. Note that the CPU time
for the self consistent ﬁeld calculations is relatively high
because a very low convergence threshold was chosen in
order to ensure the accuracy of the succeeding gradient
calculation (the gradient calculation is the more accurate,
the more accurately the self consistent ﬁeld equations are
solved).

The CPU times thus indicate that analytical gradients
can be computed at a relatively low expense. Compared
with numerical gradients, it appears that analytical gra-
dients should usually be favorable, especially because nu-
merical gradients will depend on the step size, and often
it will be necessary to break a symmetry for a ﬁnite dis-
placement, to compute the numerical gradient. Numeri-
cal gradients require at least one additional energy eval-
uation for each coordinate to be optimized, which makes
analytical gradients clearly favorable, if there is a large
number of geometrical parameters.

VI. CONCLUSION

A formalism for the calculation of the analytical gra-
dient of the Hartree-Fock energy, with respect to the cell
parameter, has been presented and implemented in the
code CRYSTAL, for the case of systems periodic in one
and two dimensions. The implementation includes the
cases of spin-restricted and unrestricted polarization. It
was shown that a high accuracy can be achieved.

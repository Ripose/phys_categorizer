Abstract

The Taylor Interpolation through FFT (TI-FFT) algorithm for the computation of the elec-

tromagnetic wave propagation in the quasi-planar geometry within the half-space is proposed in

this article. There are two types of TI-FFT algorithm, i.e., the spatial TI-FFT and the spectral

TI-FFT. The former works in the spatial domain and the latter works in the spectral domain. It

has been shown that the optimized computational complexity is the same for both types of TI-FFT

algorithm, which is N opt

r N opt

o O(N log2 N ) for an N = Nx × Ny computational grid, where N opt

r

is

the optimized number of slicing reference planes and N opt

is the optimized order of Taylor series.

o

Detailed analysis shows that N opt

o

is closely related to the algorithm’s computational accuracy γTI,

which is given as N opt

o ∼ − ln γTI and the optimized spatial slicing spacing between two adjacent

spatial reference planes δopt

wave, which is given as δopt

z only depends on the characteristic wavelength λc of the electromagnetic
z ∼ 1

17 λc. The planar TI-FFT algorithm allows a large sampling spacing

required by the sampling theorem. What’s more, the algorithm is free of singularities and it works

particularly well for the narrow-band beam and the quasi-planar geometry.

INTRODUCTION

The computation of electromagnetic wave propagation using the direct integration

method is not eﬃcient for the large-scale computation because the direct integration method

has a daunting computational complexity of O (N 2) for an N = Nx × Ny computational

grid, e.g., in the beam-shaping mirror system design for the Quasi-Optical (QO) gyrotron

application, days of computation is required [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Fortunately, when the computa-

tional geometry is a plane, the FFT has been shown to be eﬃcient in the electromagnetic

wave computation [6, 7, 8], which has a computational complexity of O(N log2 N) and a low

sampling rate only limited by the Nyquist rate. For the quasi-planar geometry, it will be

shown in this article that the FFT can still be used with the help of the Taylor Interpolation

(TI) technique.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II gives the 2-Dimensional (2D)

Fourier spectrum of the electromagnetic wave in its closed-form expression. Section III

presents the optimized spatial and spectral types of TI-FFT algorithm.

In Section IV,

one numerical example is used to show the performance of the planar TI-FFT algorithm.

Section V discusses the advantages and problems of the planar TI-FFT algorithm; some

helpful suggestions are given. Finally, Section VI summarizes the planar TI-FFT algorithm.

The scheme used to illustrate the planar TI-FFT algorithm is shown in Fig. 1 and the time

dependence ejωt has been assumed in this article.

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE IN THE SPECTRAL DOMAIN

In this section, the 2D Fourier spectrum and far-ﬁeld of the electromagnetic wave for the

radiation integral are shown to be closely related to each other.

A. The radiation integral

slicing spacing in the spatial TI-FFT.

∂τ (n) =⇒ (−jkτ )nG>(kx, ky, r′),

τ = x, y, z.

In the far-ﬁeld limit, R ≃ r → ∞,

G(r) =

e−jk|r|

R = r in the far-ﬁeld limit.

(25)

Following the similar procedure given in (24), the far-ﬁelds of derivatives (order n) of the

∂τ (n) = (−jkτ )n e−jk|r|

(26)

It is not diﬃcult to see that the far-ﬁelds and the 2D Fourier spectra are closely related

to each other.

E. The 2D Fourier spectra of the 3D spatial convolutions

It is not diﬃcult to see that, the radiation integral in (1) can be expressed as the sum of the

3D spatial convolutions of some source terms with the Green’s function related expressions.

For simplicity, let’s consider the 3D spatial convolution of an arbitrary source term s with

the scalar Green’s function G,

III. THE PLANAR TI-FFT ALGORITHM

In this section, the optimized spatial and spectral TI-FFTs are presented.

It will be

shown that both of them have the same computational complexity for the same quasi-planar

surface.

A. The spatial TI-FFT algorithm

It has been shown in (36) that the electric ﬁeld E on a plane can be evaluated through

the 2D inverse Fourier transform. For a quasi-planar surface, the TI technique can be used,

which leads to the spatial TI-FFT algorithm (where the quasi-planar surface is sliced into

many small spatial subdomains, as shown Fig. 1).

should note that the actual maximum interpolation distance is δz

2 , which is located at the
middle of two adjacent spatial reference planes, but δz is used in this article to simplify the

notation. Apparently, to achieve the desired computational accuracy (denoted as γTI), the

choice of the spatial slicing spacing δz between two adjacent spatial reference planes depends

on △kz,c, which is deﬁned as

where, k⊥,c is the characteristic bandwidth (beyond which the 2D Fourier spectrum F is

larger the δz could be, which also means a smaller Nr. So, a narrow-band beam and a small

surface variation △zc (quasi-planar geometry) are in favor of the planar TI-FFT algorithm.

In view of the importance of the spatial slicing spacing δz, it is helpful to deﬁne the

characteristic wave length λc for a narrow-band beam. From (40),

B. The spectral TI-FFT algorithm

It has been shown in (35) that the computation of the 2D Fourier spectrum F is equivalent

to evaluate the radiation vector L. For the quasi-planar geometry, the FFT can still be used

with the help of the TI technique, which leads to the spectral TI-FFT algorithm (where the

spherical spectral surface is sliced into many small spectral subdomains, as shown Fig. 5).

From (31), the radiation vector L can be rewritten as

IV. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS

To show the eﬃciency of the planar TI-FFT algorithm, the direct integration of the radi-

ation integral in (1) has been used to make comparison with the planar TI-FFT algorithm.

The numerical example used for such purpose is a 110 GHz Fundamental Gaussian Beam

(FGB) scattered by a PEC quasi-planar surface with a sin wave perturbation. The 110 GHz

FGB has a wavelength of λ ∼ 2.7 mm.

A. The numerical results

The incident 110 GHz FGB propagates at −ˆz direction and has a beam waist radius of

w = 1 cm. The quasi-planar PEC surface with a sine wave perturbation is described as

FGB starts to propagate). Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the magnitude patterns of x-, y-,

and z-components of the scattered output ﬁeld Es. The comparison of the result obtained

from the planar TI-FFT algorithm and that from the direct integration method is given in

Fig. 9, for both the magnitudes and the real parts, which shows that the planar TI-FFT

algorithm has the desired −80 dB computational accuracy.

TABLE I, it can be seen that, even though at a large sampling spacing δ = 0.46λ (Nx =

Ny ∼ 128), the coupling coeﬃcients are still well above 90.00%. At this sampling rate, the

direct integration method using Simpson’s 1/3 rule is not accurate enough [1, 2, 3]. Also

note that the coupling coeﬃcients Cτ (τ = x, y, z) reach their maximum values of 99.99% at

Nx = Ny ∼ 256 (δx = δy = 0.23λ), after which the accuracies remain constant and thus the

Nyquist rate can be estimated roughly as NNyquist ∼ 256. The reason for this phenomenon

V. DISCUSSION: PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

Although the planar TI-FFT algorithm has so many advantages given above, some prob-

lems do exist in the practical applications.

1. Complicate geometry

As an example, consider surface S shown in Fig. 12, where the surface itself is not a

quasi-planar surface and the direct implementation of the planar TI-FFT algorithm requires

a large number of FFT operations, which can be seen from the spatial reference planes

with a spatial slicing spacing δz. The problem can be solved by dividing surface S into two

surface patches △S1 and △S2, which can be considered as quasi-planar surfaces and the

planar TI-FFT can be used on them independently, with coordinate systems selected based

on the spatial reference planes. At the extreme limit where surface patches △S1 and △S2

are planes, the number of FFT operations reduces to NFFT = 2.

2. Observation points not on the computational grid

It is well-known that the FFT requires an even grid spacing (but δx and δy need not to be

equal), which raises the question of how to calculate the electric ﬁeld at points that are not

exactly on the computational grid, e.g., the red ﬁlled circles in Fig. 13. One solution for this

problem is to zero-pad the computational grid in the spectral domain, which corresponds to

the interpolation of the computational grid in the spatial domain, as shown in Fig. 14. In

the above example, it has been assumed that the observation points are evenly distributed

patches △S1 and △S2. The computations of each surface patch is done in its corresponding

coordinate system whose z-coordinate is perpendicular to the slicing spatial reference planes.

and the interpolation results are exact provided that the sampling rate is above the Nyquist

rate [7]. For complicate observation point conﬁgurations (e.g., unevenly distributed points),

the approximate techniques like the Gauss’s forward/backward interpolations can be used.

3. The translation in spatial domain

In the real situation, the source ﬁeld surface and the observation surface are separate

far away from each other (see Fig. 15).

It is not practical nor necessary to use a large

computational grid that covers both the source ﬁeld surface and the observation surface.

This kind of problem can be solved by using two computational grids, one for the source

ﬁeld surface and the other for the observation surface, with the same grid spacings (δx, δy).

Then the translation of the observation coordinate system in the spatial domain, which is

denoted as (x0, y0), corresponds to the phase shift in the spectral domain. Suppose the

4. Computational redundancy

In the numerical implementation of the planar TI-FFT algorithm, the spatial domain or

the spectral domain are divided into many small subdomains where the FFT can be used to

interpolate the electromagnetic ﬁeld (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 5). However, the FFT operation is

done on the whole spatial or spectral domain even though the interpolation is only necessary

on the relatively small subdomain, which causes the computational redundancy in the planar

TI-FFT algorithm. Fortunately, the computational redundancy is small for a quasi-planar

surface and a narrow-band beam.

25

VI. CONCLUSION

In this article, the optimized planar TI-FFT algorithm for the computation of electro-

magnetic wave propagation has been introduced for the narrow-band beam and the quasi-

planar geometry. Two types of TI-FFT algorithm are available, i.e., the spatial TI-FFT

and the spectral TI-FFT. The former is for computation of electromagnetic wave on the

quasi-planar surface and the latter is for computation of the 2D Fourier spectrum of the

electromagnetic wave. The optimized order of Taylor series used in the planar TI-FFT al-

gorithm is found to be closely related to the algorithm’s computational accuracy γTI, which

is given as N opt

o ∼ − ln γTI and the optimized spatial slicing spacing between two adjacent

spatial reference planes only depends on the characteristic wavelength λc of the electro-

magnetic wave, which is δopt

17 λc. The optimized computational complexity is given as
o O (N log2 N) for an N = Nx × Ny computational grid. The planar TI-FFT algo-

r N opt

N opt

z ∼ 1

rithm allows a low sampling rate (large sampling spacing) required by the sampling theorem.

Also, the algorithm doesn’t have the problem of singularity. The planar TI-FFT algorithm

has applications in near-ﬁeld and far-ﬁeld computations, beam-shaping mirror system de-

signs, diﬀraction and scattering phenomena, millimeter wave propagation, and microwave

imaging in the half-space scenario.

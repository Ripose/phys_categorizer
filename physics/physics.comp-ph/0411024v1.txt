Abstract

We present ﬁrst scientiﬁc results, technical details and recent devel-
opments in the Estonian Grid. Ideas and concepts behind Grid tech-
nology are described. We mention some most crucial parts of a Grid
system, as well as some unique possibilities in the Estonian situation.
Scientiﬁc applications currently running on Estonian Grid are listed.
We discuss the ﬁrst scientiﬁc computations and results the Estonian
Grid. The computations show that the middleware is well chosen and
the Estonian Grid has remarkable stability and scalability. The au-
thors present the collected results and experiences of the development
of the Estonian Grid and add some ideas of the near future of the
Estonian Grid.

1 Introduction

Since the beginning of the computer age, supercomputers have been at the
forefront of scientiﬁc computation due to high resource and computational
needs. In the past years this approach has changed. Since building a stable
supercomputer is a very expensive task, more and more is invested in search
for cheaper and more ﬂexible alternatives [1]. On the other hand, many
international scientiﬁc experiments will need a huge computational power
in near future and it will be impossible in practice to cover these needs
using any one supercomputer. Additionally, nowadays the communities and
experimental facilities of international scientiﬁc experiments are distributed
geographically. The Grid technology promises to give solution for the both
sides [2]. It is an ideology of using low cost personal computer clusters as the
building blocks and the Internet to connect the blocks. By interconnecting
them through so called Grid middleware we can put together a ”virtual”
supercomputer [3].

In modern terms, the Grid is a standardised layer of software between
the cluster query systems, storage elements, users and other Grid resources.
Grid middleware is the component that will bind all kinds of resources (dif-
ferent hardware architecture, diﬀerent operating systems, etc) into a uniform
system with standardised tools. Its power lies in parallelisation and massive
execution of computational tasks, so called Grid jobs. It enables scientists to
create a computational job, split it into as many independent sub-jobs and
then send them to the Grid. Finally, after the jobs are calculated the results
are downloaded and analyzed. That kind of parallelisable computation is
most suited for massive scientiﬁc calculations like detector simulations and
data analysis in high energy and radiation physics, genetics and bioinformat-
ics, climate modelling and weather forecast, but it is also suited for many
commercial purposes, for example rendering of animations in movie indus-
try, simulate electronic systems, etc. A deeper overview of Grid ideology and
technology is given in the books by Foster et al [3] and Berman et al [4].

There are many projects under development leading to a diversity of
technological approaches, for example UNICORE, Globus, Legion, Gridbus,
etc. Same of them support only a minimal set of functionality (e.g. Globus),
others try to develop a maximum set of tools and functions (e.g. UNICORE)
[5].

Some international scientiﬁc collaborations will very soon need Grid tech-
nology: LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN (European Organization for
Nuclear Research) [6], the Planck Mission for analysis of cosmological back-
ground radiation [7], analysis of the human genome at the Human Genome
Project [8] etc. CERN is a leading developer and user of Grid technology

1

due to the schedule of the LHC experiment (starting in 2007) [9].

It is important to mention that Grid system does not cover the function-
ality of supercomputer one-by-one. On one hand, Grid has many additional
possibilities for large-scale collaboration, but on the other hand it does not
have several functionalities of a typical supercomputer. The strongest restric-
tion is the inability to use shared or distributed memory parallel computing
in geographically distributed Grid environment. This restriction comes from
the latency of Internet connection. Finally, the speed of light sets a natural
limit for shared memory on the geographical scale.

In the scientiﬁc part of the paper we focus on two tasks. First we pro-
pose a new method for modelling same spectra in the mobile and small
gamma spectrometer: we combine the Monte Carlo (MC) method in ra-
diation physics and distributed calculations on Grid. Due to experimental
complications and expenses the numerical modelling is a suitable method to
model gamma spectrometers. Unfortunately it needs a lot of computational
resources. In the Grid we can divide our MC simulation into hundreds of
independent sub-simulations and send them to the Grid. It is a practical way
for computations, but it a good possibility to test a Grid system as well. We
used the statistics of the sub-jobs to estimate the stability and reliability of
the system.

The using of Grid was very promising, the Grid middleware used was
suﬃciently stable for this type of computations. The results of the MC
modelling are realistic and give some needed hints for the experimental set
up in the future.

2 Architecture of Grid

To ensure uniﬁed standards the Global Grid Forum (GGF) sets the speciﬁ-
cations and agreements for Grid systems: OGSA (Open Grid Services Ar-
chitecture), RSL (Resource Speciﬁcation Language), etc [10]. As mentioned,
not all Grid projects follow the speciﬁcations precisely and there are some
freedom and uncovered areas in the speciﬁcations and agreements.

Figure 1 presents the layered architecture of a typical Grid system [2].
For a fully functional Grid one needs four components (named by the GGF
[10] and NorduGrid project [18]):

•

Cluster Element (CE) – an actual node/farm/cluster/supercomputer
on what Grid jobs are executed. Typically in a Grid environment this
is a Linux farm with some job scheduling system like PBS. The frontend
of the farm is connected to Grid where it accepts Grid jobs and submits

2

•

•

them as local jobs. Once the jobs have ﬁnished it will return the results
as speciﬁed.

Storage Element (SE) – a node that has some data storage resources
attached to it that is available for Grid usage. As the Grid is a decen-
tralised system, there is need to store input and result ﬁles in a common
place for easier management. Special storage elements were designed
for this purpose that allow storage and retrieval of ﬁles through Grid.

QDRL (Quasi Dynamic Resource Locator), also known as GIIS (Grid
Index Information Service) – is responsible for information propaga-
tion of Grid resources through the entire network. CE and SE register
their resource information to the local GRIS (Grid Resource Informa-
tion System) which is typically located in the CE or SE itself. GRIS
registers its address in the nearest QDRL which then propagates the
GRIS location up its chain.

•

UI (User Interface) – a command line or GUI interface allowing user
to submit new Grid jobs, monitor existing ones, retrieve results, kill
running jobs, etc.

•

Special Component or Device – a special facility connected directly to
the Grid, for example a particle detector, an environmental sensor, etc.

A typical Grid middleware toolkit, the Globus Toolkit, is produced by
the Globus project [12]. Globus Toolkit (GT) is in itself not a fully func-
tional Grid middleware, but a Grid middleware toolkit/API. It is popular:
many middleware packages have been built upon GT and rely upon its func-
tions for the basic functionality like GSI (Grid Security Infrastructure), MDS
(QDRL is based on MDS, which is a modiﬁed LDAP system), Globus-IO (for
ﬁle transfers) etc. Globus project itself is a collaboration connecting many
scientiﬁc institutions and sponsored by many organisations like NASA, IBM,
Cisco, Microsoft etc [12].

2.1 Security of Grid

Also a very important aspect of Grid is the ability to submit and download
jobs in secure way from anywhere in the world. Most Grids under devel-
opment around the world use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as a method
for authentication the actors of the Grid [13]. Following PKI every user and
resource element in the Grid has to have a certiﬁcate signed by Certiﬁcation
Authority (CA). The using of PKI gives a unique possibility in Estonia. It

3

is possible to use the local electronic ID-card (SmartCard) infrastructure in
Estonia based on PKI for the potential Grid users [14]. It means that an
Estonian inhabitant with valid electronic ID-card can use that for the Grid.
Thus, there is a possibility to save resources using this ready PKI structure.
There are only some countries in Europe where the electronic PKI-based
ID-card infrastructure are available: Belgium, Estonia, Finland and Sweden
[15].

4 Technical details and problems

4.1 Choice of middleware and compatibility

The ﬁrst problem of a potential developer of a Grid system is to ﬁnd func-
tional middleware for that. As mentioned before there are many diﬀerent
possibilities, but most middleware packages are in testing state with poor
support for the users. We followed the tendency of CERN [9] and our neigh-
boring countries [18] and decided to use the middleware based on Globus
Toolkit. One of the well-supported and functional middlewares based on the
Globus Toolkit, the ARC (Advance Resource Connector) middleware, is de-
veloped by the NorduGrid project [18]. That is the ﬁrst and foremost reason
why this middleware is used for the EG.

The strongest alternatives of the ARC software were the EDG package
(based on Globus Toolkit) [19] and UNICORE [20]. The problem of EDG is
insuﬃcient user support. The problem of UNICORE is that it is unsupported
by CERN and some other international projects.

On level of OGSA all the middleware packages are compatible. However,
there are many non-compatible sub- or additional components in diﬀerent
Grid systems, e.g. the schema of information system, management of storage
elements, etc. Hopefully, these non-compatibilities will soon be resolved.

4.2 Grid PKI

Traditionally each country has at least one CA for Grid. (There are some
exceptions, e.g. NorduGrid project [18]). The CA of the EG follows the X.509
rules [21]. The Certiﬁcation Policy and Certiﬁcation Practice Statement
(CP/CPS) document for the CA is composed. It is presented online on the
web page of the EG [22]. The CP/CPS document follows all the EUGridPMA
rules, it is synchronized with the EUGridPMA organisation [23] and the local
CA is trusted by the EUGridPMA members.
In the near future, we will
support the Estonian electronic PKI-based ID-card infrastructure [14] for
the EG.

5

4.3

Information System and Web-based monitoring

The information system of the EG is based on the NorduGrid LDAP schema
[24]. It is decentralised and follows a structure that is similar to the Internet
DNS. There are typically three levels of information servers or QDRLs: the
top level QDRLs (so called α-level), the second (or country) level QDRLs (so
called β-level) and the third or unit level QDRLs (so called γ-level). The tree
of QDRL can be continued with an additional lower level QDRLs if needed.
The information coming directly from LDAP is not really human read-
able. Therefore, the Web-based monitoring interface is developed by the
NorduGrid project. There are many online monitors available, for example
the NorduGrid Monitor [25], EG Monitor [26], etc.

4.4 Present state of the EG

Figure 2 gives a technical view of the development of the EG. It shows some
important parameters of the EG: the total number of CPUs and total RAM
connected to the EG. Currently the EG has 7 CEs with 62 CPU in total.
Most CPUs are from Intel (between 2.4 and 3.06 GHz) and the average RAM
is between 512 MB and 1 GB. There are two test SEs available with 160 GB
storage in total in the EG. The exact numbers and current situation of the
resources are presented by the EG Monitor [26]. A typical link between the
PCs of a CE is 1 Gbps. The fast Myrinet (2 Gbps) link is used at the NICPB
cluster and the fast Scali link is used at the EENet cluster. The links between
the CEs are limited by the typical Internet connection in Estonia (below 1
Gbps).

4.5 General problems

Some problems are recognized during the building up of the EG. There are
two big classes of the problem: organisational and technical problems. The
organisational problems are caused by the fact that the Grid is distributed
system. There is a similarity between the beginning of the Internet and
Grid [2]. Special decisions are needed for resource sharing and local and
general responsibilities.
It can be solved by the special contracts between
resource owners and/or personal agreements between technical persons. At
the moment all the problems have been solved on the level of technical and
personal agreements. However, in near future the EG will need some oﬃcial
agreements between resource owners.

The technical problems are connected to the fact that Grid middleware
is in very rapid developing process. Generally, our choice, the NorduGrid

6

ARC package has shown surprisingly good stability. There are much more
problems connected to management of the hard- and software of the clusters
than the problems connected to the middleware.

5 Scientiﬁc applications ported to the EG

5.1 Modelling and analysis software for the interna-

tional CMS experiment

The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment [27] involves one of the
biggest high energy particle detector at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at
CERN scheduled to begin operation in the year 2007. The LHC will collide
7 TeV proton beams head on. It can also collide beams of heavy ions such as
lead with total collision energy in excess of 1250 TeV. The main objective of
the CMS and LHC is explain the origin of particle mass, ﬂavour and possible
uniﬁcation of fundamental interactions at high energy scales. In the Standard
Model of particle interactions all the charged fermions acquire masses due
to the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry via the Higgs mechanism,
predicting the existence of a physical neutral scalar particle, the Higgs boson.
The CMS collaboration involves about 1990 scientists coming from 150
institutions distributed in 31 nations. The NICPB have been in collaboration
since 1996. One of our tasks is to study and port of CMS software to simu-
late, digitize and analyse event creation in the CMS detector. The software
consists of three parts:

•

•

•

CMKIN [28] – a Monte Carlo (MC) physics generation application writ-
ten to simplify the use of diﬀerent MC generators like PYTHIA [29],
HERWIG, TAUOLE, TopRex etc. It is used to generate ideal proton-
proton collisions and the produced particles and its output is taken as
input to OSCAR.

OSCAR [28] – simulates particle passage through the CMS detector
and simulates hits in diﬀerent parts of detectors. OSCAR uses the
Geant4 software package that is described in the next subsection.

ORCA [28] – the actual tool that will be used also when the real de-
tector goes online.
It is currently used for data reconstruction from
simulated runs and also for later analysis.

One event in the above software means one proton-proton collision within
the CMS detector. The collisions will happen approximately 108 times per
second when the LHC will go online. It means that the data production of

7

the detectors of the LHC will be huge, about 10 000 TB data per year. The
analysis of this data needs computational power that is equal to about 100 000
fast modern PCs. Fortunately the events can be looked at as separate entities
as they do not depend on other events and the Grid can be the solution for
the data analysis.

The current tests that have been performed on the EG have been the
creation of data sets from CMKIN particle generation to ORCA reconstruc-
tion and also some preliminary analysis. The code has worked remarkably
well and we have managed to produce a lot of events for later more detailed
analysis.

5.2 Parallel solver for linear systems of equations

DOUG (Domain decomposition On Unstructured Grids) is a black box par-
allel iterative solver for ﬁnite element systems arising from elliptic partial
diﬀerential equations [30]. Used in conjunction with a ﬁnite element discreti-
sation code, DOUG will solve the resulting linear systems using an iterative
method, and provides a range of powerful domain decomposition precondi-
tioners.

The code is designed to run eﬀectively in parallel on virtually any ma-
chine that supports MPI. The matrix-vector operations arising in the itera-
tive method are parallelised using graph partitioning software and additive
Schwarz preconditioners can be automatically constructed by the DOUG
using only minimal input. A full additive Schwarz preconditioner with auto-
matically generated coarse grid is provided in 2D and 3D. The DOUG makes
no assumptions whatsoever about the ﬁnite element mesh that the problem
arises from; it may be as unstructured as necessary and only the basic output
from the mesh generator and the ﬁnite element discretisation are required as
inputs to the DOUG.

Currently the DOUG is mainly used in solution of matrices having block
structure which arise from discretisation of coupled systems of diﬀerent dif-
ferential equations (like the Navier Stokes ﬂow equations) and in stability
assessment problem of nuclear power station cooling systems. This research
is done in collaboration with researchers from Bath University (Spence A.
and Graham I.G.) and AEA Technology (Cliﬀe K.A.) in UK.

The DOUG has a graphical user interface implemented as a Web-interface
[31, 32]. The Grid-awareness is added to the Web-interface for the DOUG
and it is available for the EG users [33]. During the development of Grid-
enabled Web-interface the problem of action on the Grid by the interface on
behalf of the user and necessity of managing users’ credentials – Grid-proxies
– had arisen. Those issues were successfully solved by using MyProxy (Online

8

Credentials Repository [34]) and appropriate developing and coding of the
interface. We have two MyProxy servers installed on EG [35].

5.3 Radiation and particle physics

Geant4 is a software toolkit for the MC simulation of the passage of particles
through matter [36]. Its application areas include high energy physics and
nuclear experiments, medical, accelerator and space physics studies. Geant4
covers the energy scale from 250 eV ut to some TeV for most known particles
and interaction processes.

The Geant4 is used like a external library for many software packages:
the OSCAR software mentioned above, medical software for radiotherapy for
cancer treatment, etc. The Geant4 software was developed by RD44 group
[38], a world-wide collaboration of about 190 scientists participating in more
than 10 experiments and 20 institutions in Europe, India, Japan, Canada
and the United States.

There are three collaboration projects using Geant4 in environmental
physics, medicine and particle/radiation detectors in Estonia. Therefore we
are interested in supporting and using the Geant4 software at the EG. The
ﬁrst scientiﬁc calculations on the EG have been done using the Geant4 soft-
ware.

5.4 Coming scientiﬁc and non-scientiﬁc applications

There is one group (Karelson M et al) using and developing the UNICORE
middleware for the OpenMolGRID (Open Computing Grid for Molecular
Science and Engineering) project in Estonia [37].

Additionally many other work groups in Estonian science and technology
are interested in Grid technology and the EG: analysis of gene information,
climate modelling, material science, etc. The interest is arising in the com-
mercial sphere as well. Some companies need computational power in the
diﬀerent topics: material engineering, nuclear safety, computer animations,
military applications, etc.

6 First scientiﬁc challenge of the EG

6.1 MC simulations in radiation physics

For the ﬁrst massive test of the EG we made some intensive scientiﬁc compu-
tations using the Geant4 software package. In our study MC method is used

9

to model the operation of a scintillation detector installed in a prototype
radiation surveillance unit on the small unmanned airplane, the so called
Ranger. Planned measurements by Ranger are complicated and dangerous
for the humans (e.g., radioactive cloud, etc.), thus, the detection capability
has to be estimated by calculative means. Most importantly the limits of the
detector have to be estimated [39].

In the study we analyse the simplest case: a isotropic radioactive point
source on the ground and the detector directly above the source in the dif-
ferent heights. A very practical question for radiation surveillance is the
diﬀerence of the spectra between diﬀerent heights. We modelled the spectra
at the heights 150 m and 100 m (Figure 3).

We have to simulate billions of gamma events to get statistically good
histograms. Therefore the calculations are very time consuming. The number
of registered gamma quants N follows the approximate equation:

N

1
r2 exp(
where r is the distance between the detector and the point source, the at-
tenuation coeﬃcient µ of the environment between the source and detector.
Thus, the statistical uncertainty of N is:

µr),

(1)

∝

−

errN = √N

(2)

Luckily an intrinsic property of radioactive emission events (and the MC
calculations as well) are that all the events are independent and we can split
the computations to smaller subtasks. So, this task is excellent for testing
purposes of a Grid system. In the following studies we focus mostly on the
testing of the EG. The experimental studies, exact details of the calculations
and additional studies will be published separately [40].

We built up our model in Geant4 (release 5.2), compiled and made some
test runs locally on a Linux PC (2.8 GHz Intel Pentium4, 1 GB RAM, RedHat
9.0). Typical compilation time of the source code of the model was around
some minutes. If the distance between the point source and the detector is
between 100 m and 150 m then the calculation time is between 0.05 ms and
0.2 ms per a source event.

The second step was to send the computations to the EG. There are two
possibilities to send a Grid job to the Grid. First, we can send the source
ﬁle of our code to the Grid and it compiles and runs on a Grid node (CE).
It means the external libraries (e.g., Geant4) has to be installed to the CE
before the sending of the job. Second, we can compile our code locally and
then send the compiled binary to run on a CE of the Grid. The drawback

10

of the last case is that the CE has to have the suitable operation system,
correct version of glib, etc. In addition, if the binary ﬁle is big then a lot of
time is spent on uploading the ﬁle. In the case of our Geant4 radionuclide
detection simulation, the binary ﬁle is rather small (3.7 MB), it runs on the
most CEs in the EG and therefore we prefer the last variation.

×

We simulated all the possible combinations: two diﬀerent radionuclide
(137Cs and 60Co), two diﬀerent detector positions (100 m and 150 m) and
additionally we changed a parameter of the system, the radius of the air
cylinder around the system (we used two diﬀerent radiuses 40 m and 100 m).
In sum, there are 8 diﬀerent cases. For satisfactory statistics in each case 80
80 = 640 billion events.
billion events were simulated. In total it means 8
We divided the total set of the simulations (640 billion) in sets of 1 billion
events. The computation time of a set is reasonable (8-16 hours) and in
compliance with the recommended maximum cycle of the random number
generator of Geant4 [36, 41]. All 640 sets were submitted as Grid jobs to the
EG.

The Figure 4 presents the results of the simulations for 137Cs and Figure
5 for 60Co. We present the spectra only for the radius of 40 m. There is
only a very slight diﬀerence between the 40 m and 100 m radiuses. It is very
close to the error limit and therefore we do not present the curves of the
100 m radius in the ﬁgures. We can see clear diﬀerence between two detector
positions, 150 m and 100 m. To estimate the concrete detection limit we
have to compare these curves with the local natural radioactivity background
case-by-case. The line structure in the Compton continuum region needs
additional studies.

6.2 Reliability of the EG

The speed of the CPUs used were between 2.4 GHz and 3.06 GHz (Intel
Pentium 4) and the available RAM per PC was between 512 MB and 1 GB.
The total time of the computations was 417 CPU days.

The results were very promising. No jobs failed due to the Grid mid-
dleware. In total there were 17 failed jobs (2.6%) during the computations,
probably due to random hardware errors. These jobs were resubmitted to
the EG and they ﬁnished successfully. There were 16 post-processing errors
(2.5%) due to the instability of the hardware/software caused by the external
factors: blackouts of electric grid, overheating, etc.

However we only tested some functionalities of the Grid. The stability of

the data management and runtime environments need additional testing.

11

7 Summary and some conclusions

The ﬁrst experiences and tests of the EG have been promising. The devel-
opment of the EG has been impressive, especially if we compare the results
and the spent resources. The installation of the middleware, management of
middleware and management of the CA of the EG, certiﬁcates, QDRLs, EG
Monitor and some CEs/SEs are done mostly as volunteer work.

The ﬁrst scientiﬁc calculations on the EG show that it is a very useful
tool for the computational scientists, especially in the ﬁeld of computational
particle and radiation physics. If the authors compare the earlier experiences
of the computations on the PC clusters [42, 43] then the using of the Grid
simpliﬁes substantially the performing of the scientiﬁc computations.

During the ﬁrst year of the EG the authors have experienced many tech-
nical and organizational problems and bottle-necks, presented here in short.

Instability of the hardware of CE. It is a typical problem for the
managers of PC farms and clusters and parallel computers. In our case
it was mostly caused by electric blackouts or overheating. Using the
Grid can mitigate the problem – the Grid job automatically ﬁnds a
working CE using the information system of the Grid. Naturally, if a
Grid job is already running on the CE then a hardware error can be
fatal for the job.

Software management on the Grid. There is no good and general
solution for that. There is a possibility to send an executable ﬁle to-
gether with the job to the Grid, but it is the reasonable solution only
if the executable ﬁle is small and does not have many external depen-
dencies. Many international Grid projects are working in that ﬁeld and
hopefully some general solutions are coming soon. Additionally there
are some problems connected to the commercial licensing politics.

Missing accounting and banking system of computing time.
The problem is very urgent and needs a quick solution. For example,
so called SGAS [45] that is developed by the SweGrid project [44] can
be one solution.

Missing general job management tool for the users. It is very
complicated to manage a lot of running Grid jobs at the same time:
resubmitting ﬁled or uncorrect jobs, collecting data, etc. A solution
can be the universal job manager software produced by Jensen et al
[46].

12

Missing interface for the electronic ID-card (SmartCard). The
interface for the SmartCard/ID-card is under development by the au-
thors.

The organizational structure of the EG. The Grid is a distributed
system and it does not need to be highly centralized. However, at least
some technical and political agreements are needed: the trust of the
CA, exchange mechanisms and rates of the computational time, etc.

As Grid technology is a new and innovative topic in computational science
and engineering, more courses and schooling are needed at the universities
and other institutions. Additionally, the Grid is an international system and
some interstate agreements are needed.

Figure 4: Two sets of spectra of 137Cs for the heights of 100 and 150 m in
logarithmic scale. The upper solid curve presents the height of 150 m and the
lower one presents that of 100 m. We can clearly see the energy peak on the
upper curve at the energy of 662 keV. The Compton continuum region has
the line structure. The reason of the line structure needs additional studies.

Figure 5: Two sets of spectra of 60Co for the heights of 100 and 150 m in

the lower one presents that of 100 m. We can clearly see the energy peaks on
the upper curve at the energy of 1173.2 keV and 1332.5 keV. The Compton
continuum region has the similar structure as the calculated spectra of 137Cs.

A new stochastic optimisation technique has enabled us to explore the probabilistic travelling
salesman problem (PTSP) with large numbers of cities (hitherto unobtainable). In this problem,
the salesman must chose the ‘a-priori’ order in which to visit the cities, before learning that certain
cities do not need to be visited, and can be pruned from the tour. The objective is to minimise the
expected length of the pruned tour. We ﬁnd the mean length of the pruned tour, for n ≫ 1, follows
E(Lpruned) = √np(0.872 − 0.105p)f (np) where n is the number of cities, p is the probability of a
city needing a visit, and f (np) → 1 as np → ∞. The mean length of the a-priori tour is found to
be E (La−priori) = p n
1.25−0.82 ln(p) is measured for 0.05 ≥ p ≥ 0.6. Scaling

arguments and indirect measurements suggest that β(p) tends towards a constant for p < 0.03.

I. INTRODUCTION

The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is to ﬁnd the
shortest tour around a number of cities, in which each
city is visited once. For small numbers of cities this is
an easy task, but the problem is NP-complete, meaning
it is believed that there is no algorithm which can solve
the problem in a time polynomial in the number of cities.
The TSP is a paradigm amongst NP-complete problems.
Consideration of the travelling salesman problem be-
gan with Beardwood et al. [1]. They showed that in the
limit of large numbers of cities n which are randomly
distributed on the unit square, the optimal tour length
(LT SP ) follows [2]

E(LT SP ) = βT SP √n + α

(1.1)

where βT SP and α are constants. Numerical simulation
[3] gives βT SP = 0.7211(3) and α = 0.604(5) as estimates
when n ≥ 50. Signiﬁcant divergence from this behaviour
is found for n ≤ 10, but numerical estimates can be found
quickly (see appendix).
The probabilistic travelling salesman problem (PTSP),
introduced by Jaillet [4,5], is an extension of the travel-
ling salesman problem (and hence of NP-complete prob-
lems) to optimisation in the face of unknown data.
Whereas all of the cities in the TSP must be visited once,
in the PTSP each city only needs to be visited with some
probability, p. One ﬁrst decides upon the order in which
the cities are to be visited, the ‘a-priori’ tour. Subse-
quently, it is revealed which cities need to be visited, and
those which do not need to be visited are skipped to leave
a ‘pruned tour’. The objective is to chose an a-priori tour
which minimises the expected length of the pruned tour.
It has been claimed [6] that, in the limit of large n, the
PTSP strategy is as good as constructing a TSP tour on
the cities requiring a visit, the re-optimisation strategy.
Our results in ﬁg. 3 show that this is false. However,
Jaillet [4] has shown that

lim

n→∞(cid:18) E (Lpruned)

√np

(cid:19) = βpruned(p)

(1.2)

where

βT SP < βpruned(p) < M in(0.9204,

βT SP
√p

).

(1.3)

Jaillet [4] demonstrated various interesting properties
of the PTSP, including an exact formula for the expected
length of the pruned tour.
If each of the n cities only
needs to be visited with some (given) probability p, then
the expected length of the pruned tour is

E(Lpruned) = p2

is the sum of the distances between each city

d(j, (j + r)modn).

(1.5)

The expected length is averaged with respect to instances
of the visiting list∗. Jaillet’s closed form expression for
the expected tour length renders the PTSP to some ex-
tent accessible as a standard (but still NP complete) opti-
misation problem, and provides some check on the PTSP
results by stochastic optimisation methods.

One attempt to solve the PTSP using a standard op-
timisation approach was taken by Laporte et al. [7] who
introduced the use of integer linear stochastic program-
ming. Although use of algorithms which may exactly
solve the PTSP are useful, they are always very limited

∗ i.e. the list of cities which actually need to be visited

1

in the size of problem which may be attempted. Further-
more, the stochastic programming algorithm even fails to
solve the PTSP on certain occasions, thus the accuracy
of any statistics concerning these results is dubious.

Two studies have used heuristics to solve the PTSP
[6,8]. Neither of these studies used global search heuris-
tics, and were very restricted in the problem size at-
tempted. The reason why a global search was not at-
tempted by either author is due to a lack of computa-
tional power. Equation 1.4 takes O(n2) time to calculate.
Thus, to solve a 100 city problem for the PTSP would
take O (10, 000) times longer than it would to solve a 100
city problem for the TSP. It should be noted, however,
that it is only possible to make this comparison is due
to the relative simplicity of the PTSP. For many more
stochastic optimisation problems, standard optimisation
techniques are not applicable.

The stochastic aspect of the PTSP crucially distin-
guishes it from the TSP. For stochastic optimisation
problems the diﬃculty is not in the optimisation of a par-
ticular function, but in the evaluation of that function.
In the PTSP we are seeking to minimise the expected
pruned tour length. In a general optimization context,
we are seeking to minimise a given function, normally
referred to as the cost function. When solving the TSP,
heuristics are commonly used. One takes an initial tour,
and considers making a series of improvements to that
tour. Since improvements are often small changes (of-
ten called a move), the eﬀect of this change can be cal-
culated quickly and easily. For stochastic optimisation
problems, this is not generally the case, and one may
well be forced to use estimates of the eﬀect of a partic-
ular move. This eﬀects the acceptance probability of a
move, rendering ordinary optimisation methods ineﬀec-
tive. New search methods are required which take into
account the stochastic nature of the problem.

The topic of stochastic optimisation problems was in-
troduced by Robbins et al [9], and a basic heuristic for
its solution. Since then, a number of alternative tech-
niques have been proposed. We will restrict our atten-
tion to global search heuristics, having in mind diﬃcult
problems (for which exact algorithms would be inappro-
priate) where we want to ﬁnd the global minimum of the
problem. There are currently three such approaches to
this problem, all based (loosely) on simulated annealing.
Firstly, there is stochastic comparison [10] which is a
development of a technique introduced by Yan and Mukai
[11]. One takes a set of random problem instances† for
both the initial and proposed conﬁguration, and com-
pares these instances. If, for any of the instances the pro-
posed conﬁguration has a larger value of the cost function
than the initial conﬁguration, then the move is rejected.

† In the case of the PTSP, an instance would be a particular
list of cities that needed to be visited

Although it has been demonstrated that this method can
converge to the global optimum, it lacks in one major
area. As the number of instances considered becomes
large, and one is more and more strenuous about which
moves to accept, it becomes more and more likely that
one rejects a favourable move (since the ﬂuctuations in
the estimate of the change in the cost function will of-
ten be much larger than the energy diﬀerence). Hence,
not only does the algorithm become ineﬃcient at large
numbers of instances, it also is incapable of supporting a
quench.

A second approach is based on a simple modiﬁed simu-
lated annealing approach. This was ﬁrst was proposed by
Bulgak and Sanders [12]. The principle behind this ap-
proach is to estimate the cost function (using a variable
number of instances) and accept all moves on the basis
of the estimate of the cost function, using a standard
simulated annealing acceptance rule. A theoretical anal-
ysis of these methods has been provided by Gutjahr and
Pﬂug [13] and Gelfand and Mitter [14]. Gutjahr et al.
showed that provided the uncertainty in the estimates of
the cost function at step n were kept to below O(n−γ)
(γ an arbitrary constant greater than one), then the gen-
eral convergence result [15] for simulated annealing still
applies.

Stochastic annealing, recently introduced by two of
us, [16] diﬀers from the other approaches in two impor-
tant areas. Firstly, the general concept of the other ap-
proaches is one of minimising the eﬀect of noise in the
cost-function evaluations. It is entirely natural, however,
that the noise from the inexact evaluations of the cost-
function can be used as a positive eﬀect, rather than as
something to be minimised. Secondly, this approach can
be easily modiﬁed to give an exact reproduction of the
simulated annealing algorithm. Although this possibility
is not ruled out by the other approaches, we know of no
attempts to perform a thermal annealing of the system.
Our approach is as follows. We take r instances of
the problem, and from these estimate the average change
in the cost-function (length in the case of the PTSP).
We chose to accept all moves for which our average of
the change in cost-function is negative (i.e.
the move
shortens the tour).
If we assume that the average of
these estimates is Gaussianly distributed about the exact
change in the cost-function, with standard deviation σ√r ,
then it follows that the acceptance probability is [16]

where ∆µ is the exact diﬀerence in the cost-function be-

abilities obey

identiﬁes the equivalent eﬀective temperature. The small
coeﬃcient of the cubic term in eq. 1.8 makes this a rather
good approximation to true thermal selection. Increasing
sample size r means that we are more stringent about not
accepting moves that increase the cost-function, equiva-
lent to lowering the temperature.

II. FORM OF THE OPTIMAL TOUR

Optimal a-priori PTSP tours for small p resemble an
angular sort, as can be seen from ﬁg. 1. An angular sort
is where cities are sorted by their angle with respect to
the centre of the square. Bertsimas [6] proposed that an
angular sort is optimal as p → 0; we can show this to
be false, since a space-ﬁlling curve algorithm is generally
superior to an angular sort as n → ∞. Such an algorithm
was introduced by Bartholdi et al. [17] using a technique
based on a Sierpinski curve.

For the angular sort with np ≫ 1, the probability of
two cities being nearest neighbours on the pruned tour
will be vanishingly small for cities which are separated

from each other by a large angle on the a-priori tour.
This means that only cities that are separated by a small
angle contribute signiﬁcantly to eq. 1.4. Thus for an n
city tour, we may approximate

L(r)

t = Lon

(2.1)

where Lo is some fraction of the side of the unit square,
since cities which are sorted with respect to angle will be
unsorted with respect to radial distance. This leads to

E(Lang) ≃ Lonp2

n−2

Xr=0

(1 − p)r.

For np ≫ 1, we ﬁnd

E(Lang) → Lonp.

By contrast it has been shown [6] that

E(Lτsf )
E(ΣT SP ) ≤ O(log(np))

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

where E(Lτsf ) is the expected length of a tour generated
by the Sierpinski curve. E(ΣT SP ) is the re-optimisation
strategy, whereupon discovering the actual city visiting
list, one re-optimises for a TSP tour (i.e. E(ΣT SP ) =
βT SP√np). Hence, E(Lτsf ) is given by

E(Lτsf ) ≤ O(βT SP √np log(np))

which leads to

E(Lτsf )
E(Lang) ≤ O(

log(np)
√np

).

So, for np ≫ 1 and n → ∞, the space ﬁlling curve is al-
ways superior to the angular sort, demonstrating that the
angular sort is generally never optimal. To summarise,
it has been demonstrated that an angular sort is not op-
timal for the PTSP.

III. SCALING ARGUMENTS

From diagrams of near-optimal PTSP tours such as
ﬁg. 1, we propose that the tour behaves diﬀerently on
diﬀerent length scales. The tour is TSP-like on the larger
length scales, but resembles a sort at smaller distances.
We may construct such a tour and use scaling arguments
to analyse both the pruned and a-priori tour lengths of
the optimal tour.

Consider dividing the unit square into a series of
‘blobs’, each blob containing 1/p cities so that of order
one city requires a visit. The number of such blobs is
given by

N ≃ np

(3.1)

and for these to approximately cover the unit square their
typical linear dimension ξ must obey

N ξ2 ∼ 1.

(3.2)

Since each blob is visited of order once by a pruned tour,
we can estimate the expected pruned tour length to be

which we will see below is veriﬁed numerically. We can
similarly estimate the a-priori tour length to be n times
the distance between two cities in the same blob. Thus,
the expected a-priori tour length is

E (La−priori) ∼ nξ ∼ r n

p

(3.4)

which we will see is more diﬃcult to conﬁrm numerically.

IV. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS FOR THE

PTSP

Using the stochastic annealing approach of Fink and
Ball [16], we have investigated near optimal PTSP tours
for a range of diﬀerent numbers of cities, and various
values of p. Eﬀective temperatures in the range kT =
0.07 − −0.01 were used, giving sample sizes in the range
r = 2 − −500. Between 10 and 80 diﬀerent random city
conﬁgurations were optimised (80 conﬁgurations for n =
30, 40 conﬁgurations for n = 60, 20 conﬁgurations for
n = 90 and 10 conﬁgurations for n ≥ 120 cities).
Figure 2 shows the master curve for the expected
pruned tour length divided by √np. The shift factors
have a linear ﬁt, suggesting that

and f (np) → 1 for large np. Figure 3 shows the expected
pruned tour length divided by the expected re-optimised
tour length. This demonstrates that the pruned tour can
be at least 10% worse than the re-optimisation strategy.
However, the data for the shift factors (ﬁg. 2) indicates
that the PTSP strategy can be no more than 0.872
0.767 − 1 =
14%(±1%) worse than the re-optimisation strategy.
The master curve for the a-priori tour length is shown
in ﬁg. 4. The a-priori tour length does not show the ex-
pected behaviour, as we would hope βa−priori(p) to tend
towards a constant as p → 0. The shift factors exhibit
a slight but signiﬁcant departure from linearity with p.
In particular and in potential conﬂict with our scaling
arguments it is not clear whether βa−priori(p) tends to a
non-zero constant as p → 0.

pected to tend towards a constant for p → 0. The slight, but

V. THE LIMITING CASE P → 0

The above computational results for the a-priori tour
length do not conﬁrm the predictions made by the scal-
ing arguments. The scaling arguments should apply in
the limits np ≫ 1 and p ≪ 1. Investigation of p ≪ 1
is available using a simple adjustment to our previous
method.

For a 3 city TSP tour, it does not matter in which order
the cities are visited. For a 4 city TSP tour, there are 3
distinct orders in which the cities may be visited. Thus,
4 city tours are the smallest at which it matters in which
order the cities are visited. If we only generate visiting
lists which contain 4 cities this will be (approximately)
equivalent to choosing p = 4
n . Thus 4 city tours provide
an eﬃcient way in which we can probe very small values
of p. For this situation, the scaling arguments predict
that

E(La−priori) ∼

n
2

.

(5.1)

Simulations in this regime were performed for N =
12−−210. 100 diﬀerent random city conﬁgurations were
used for N < 30, 20 conﬁgurations were used for N ≤ 90
and 10 conﬁgurations for N ≥ 120. Figure 5 shows a
linear-log plot of the shift factors for the a-priori tour
length and the equivalent measurement for the 4-city

data (cid:16)

2∗Length(cid:17). The two sets of data do lie very close
to each other (as one might expect them to) but are not
exactly the same. The saturation of
2∗Length for large n
suggests that the proposed scaling behaviour is correct
for small p. To summarise

VI. NOTES ON ALGORITHM

IMPLEMENTATION

Stochastic annealing was implemented with a combina-
tion of the 2-opt and 1-shift move-sets [18]. Both move-
sets work similarly to that which would be expected for
the deterministic case. One must sample a number of dif-
ferent visiting lists from which the expected pruned tour
length change can be estimated. Once a visiting list has
been revealed, the length change is determined entirely
locally. One need not generate the entire visiting list,
but rather determine the set of nearest cities that will
specify the length change (see ﬁg. 6). For the PTSP, the
location of the nearest cities on the visiting list to the
move is determined from a simple Poisson distribution.
When using stochastic optimisation, the only variable
over which we have control is the sample size (in the

If the transition were
simple ﬁrst order, then the ﬁnal length would be the same in
both cases. They are not, and the transition is unhelpful in
annealing. The fast annealing does show a sharp transition,
but this occurs at diﬀerent points in the annealing, thus the
average (plotted) does not show a sharp transition.

PTSP, the number of visiting lists we generate). How-
ever, this does not necessarily imply that r, the sample
size, should be a monotonically increasing function. The
temperature in simulated annealing is analogous to σ√r
(see eq. 1.9). Thus it is important that we attempt to
anneal the system with respect to σ√r rather than just r.
In the particular case of the PTSP σ, as measured,
decreases on average with decreasing temperature. This
can be a helpful eﬀect, since it means that r need not
be as large as might be expected to achieve a low tem-
perature. However, the variation in σ can dominate the
behaviour of σ√r , thus it may be necessary to transiently
reduce r to avoid a sharp drop in T . If one continuously
increases the sample size, then a phase transition is seen
in pruned tour length (see ﬁg. 7). This is a transition
to a non-optimal state for the system, and thus is not of
use in optimisation. The system was annealed using a
monotonically increasing r, from r = 130 to r = 370 for
500,000 and 5,000,000 Monte Carlo steps with n = 300
and p = 0.05 using 10 runs. The ﬁnal pruned tour length
of the fast and slow runs were Lf ast = 3.79 ± 0.01 and
Lslow = 3.73 ± 0.01. This demonstrates that it is a tran-
sition to a non-optimal state.

VII. CONCLUSION

We have considered the PTSP as a diﬃcult stochastic
optimisation problem and introduced a crossover scal-
ing interpretation of the PTSP where the a-priori tour
is TSP-like on large scales, and a sort on shorter length
scales. This gives behaviour which agrees with the com-
putational results, with the pruned tour length given by
eq. 4.1.

The a-priori tour length is more subtle in nature than

the pruned tour length. We introduced 4-city tours to
probe the a-priori tour length as p → 0. This allows
us to conclude that the crossover scaling interpretation
gives the correct behaviour for p < 0.03, as given by eq.
5.2. Direct conﬁrmation of this result is left as a future
challenge.

We have also demonstrated stochastic annealing to be
a robust and eﬀective stochastic optimisation technique.
It has been noted that for a Gaussian error distribution
σ√r is the eﬀective temperature. It is this quantity which
needs to be controlled, rather than simply r. By intro-
ducing an acceptance probability it is possible to simulate
a truly thermal system, provided the error distribution
is known. This is a topic for future work.

NEB would like to thank BP Amoco & EPSRC for the

support of a CASE award during this research.

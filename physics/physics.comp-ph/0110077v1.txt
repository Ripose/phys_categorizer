Abstract

It is demonstrated that the wavelets can be used to considerably speed up simulations
of the wave packet propagation in multiscale systems. Extremely high eﬃciency is
obtained in the representation of both bound and continuum states. The new method
is compared with the fast Fourier algorithm. Depending on ratios of typical scales of a
quantum system in question, the wavelet method appears to be faster by a few orders
of magnitude.

1. Owing to the fast development of the computational tools the direct solution of the
time-dependent Schroedinger equation has become one of the basic approaches to study the
evolution of quantum systems. Thus, the wave packet propagation (WPP) method is success-
fully applied to time dependent and time-independent problems in gas-surface interactions,
molecular and atomic physics, and quantum chemistry [1, 2, 3, 4]. One of the main issues of
the numerical approaches to the time-dependent Schroedinger equation is the representation
of the system. Development of the pseudospectral global grid
of the wave function
representation approaches yielded a very eﬃcient way to tackle this problem. The discrete
variable representation (DVR) [5] and the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method (FGH) [6, 7]
have been widely used in time-dependent molecular dynamics [1, 2, 8], S-matrix [9, 10] or
eigenvalue [11] calculations. The FGH method based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
algorithm is especially popular. This is because for the mesh of N points the evaluation of
the kinetic energy operator requires only NlogN operations and can be easily implemented
In the standard FGH method the wave function is represented on a grid of
numerically.
equidistant point in coordinate and momentum space. It is well suited when the the local
de Broglie wavelength does not change much over the physical region spanned by the wave
function of the system [11]. There are, however, lot of examples where the system under con-
sideration spans the physical regions with very diﬀerent properties. Consider, for example,
the scattering of a slow particle on a narrow and deep potential well. Despite the short wave
lengths occur only in the well, in the FGH method they would determine the lattice mesh
over entire physical space leading to high computational cost. In fact, pseudospectral global
grid representation approaches are diﬃcult to use in multiscale problems.

This is why much of work has been devoted recently to the development of the mapping
procedures in order to enhance sampling eﬃciency in the regions of the rapid variation of
the wave function [8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Though mapping procedure, based on the variable
change x = f (ξ) is very eﬃcient in 1D, it is far from being universal. One obvious drawback

1

is that it is diﬃcult to implement in higher dimensions. In the case of several variables, there
is no simple procedure to deﬁne the mapping functions f so that the lattice would be ﬁne only
in some designated regions of space. Next, the topology of the new coordinate surfaces can
be diﬀerent from that of Cartesian planes. Therefore the Jacobian may vanish at some points
(e.g., spherical coordinates). This leads to singularity in the kinetic energy and imposes small
time step in simulations [16].

In this letter we propose a novel approach to the wave packet propagation in multiscale
systems. It is based on the use of wavelets as basis functions in the projected Hilbert space.
In contrast to the plane waves, the wavelets are localized in both real and momentum spaces.
This characteristic property of wavelets allows us to accurately describe short wave length
components of the wave function in designated spatial regions, while keeping only few basis
elements in the bulk. This leads to a drastic reduction of the projected Hilbert space dimension
without any loss of accuracy. In some cases it may even become possible to diagonalize the
Hamiltonian matrix so that the time evolution can be elementary followed in the basis of
eigenstates. We illustrate our approach by simulations of a simple multiscale one-dimensional
scattering problem. A generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward and based on
the standard mathematical construction of multidimensional wavelets [17]. Wavelet bases
have been successfully used for the systematic treatment of the multiple length scales in
the electronic structure of matter [18, 19, 20, 21] (for a comprehensive review see [22] and
references therein). Here we apply, for the ﬁrst time, wavelets to study the time evolution in
multiscale quantum systems and demonstrate the advantages of the wavelet method over the
conventional FGH method.

2. To illustrate the eﬃciency of the wavelet method in the wave packet propagation, we
consider the 1D scattering of an electron on a narrow and deep potential well. Despite we
use an electron as a projectile, procedure described below readily applies to molecular or
atomic wave packets. The potential has the form ˆV =
(100x)2] (atomic units are
0.63200. We
used throughout the paper) and supports single bound state with the energy
are interested in the transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients for the energies of the scattered
electron within 0.2
1.1 range. This corresponds to a typical wave length λ = 2π which is
much larger than the potential well width. To calculate the scattering properties of the system
we use the Gaussan wave packet impinging on a potential well. The calculation requires a
typical size of the box x
60, 60], where 18 a.u. from each side are allocated for an optical
potential ˆVopt that absorbs reﬂected and transmitted waves [7].

We ﬁrst introduce a uniform lattice and simulate the wave packet propagation by means
of the FGH method. Split-operator technique [6, 16] is used to calculate the action of the

corresponding wavelets from the kth resolution level form a good basis for a band centered
at 2−kλ1. In our case we have used k = 1, 2, 3, 4. The number of wavelets needed on each
resolution level is determined by the potential width (by its shape, in general). The technical
details are explained in Section 3. It appears necessary to take 20 wavelets on each resolution
level. Thus, all together we use only 240 + 4

For the sake of comparison, we also used Eq. (1) to simulate the time evolution. The same
accuracy is achieved for a time step comparable to the time step in FGH method. However
there is an alternative, much better splitting scheme thanks to the localization properties of
wavelets. Consider the decomposition ˆH = ˆH1 + ˆH2 where ˆH1 contains matrix elements of the
basis elements localized in the vicinity of the potential well, while ˆH2 corresponds to the free
space and, therefore, contains matrix elements only of the scaling functions. The propagation

where
(1) the error depends on the spectral range of operators involved. For larger spectral ranges,
the errors get larger. The conventional way to cope with this problem is to reduce the time
step. The approach (3), which we call the “wavelet tower diagonalization”, oﬀers a better

3

alternative. The convergence here is drastically improved because (a) [ ˆH1, ˆH2] is small and
(b) the operator ˆH1 with a large spectral range can be diagonalized. Both the properties are
hardly achievable without the wavelet basis. In our example the convergence is reached for
a time step dt = 0.01 (vs dt = 0.0002 in (1)). Corresponding results are presented in Fig.
1. This approach applies even better to evolving heavy-particle wave packets because the
Chebyshev [16, 23] or Lanczos [16, 24] schemes can be used. These schemes are, ﬁrst, more
eﬃcient than the split method and, second, allow one to take full advantage of the sparse
structure of the Hamiltonian in the wavelet basis (see below).

Note also that by making the potential depth greater so that the minimal wave length
becomes twice shorter, we would have to increase the lattice size by factor two in the Fourier
method, thus increasing the number of coeﬃcients needed to describe the wave packet by 214
(!), while in our wavelet approach one more resolution level is to be added, implying only
20 extra wavelet coeﬃcients in the wave packet decomposition. Thus, the wavelet approach
oﬀers a systematic and easy way to improve the accuracy of simulations.

3. The description of technical details of our approach is limited to essential practical
steps necessary to reproduce our results and to apply the algorithm to new systems. A
general theoretical analysis of wavelets bases in multidimensional spaces can be found in [17].

(iii). From the deﬁnition of φl,j and ψk,j it is clear that the index j indicates the position
of support of the scaling function or wavelet. The index k of ψk,j can be understood as follows.
Let the Fourier transform of the mother wavelet ψ be peaked at a momentum p0. Then the
Fourier transform of ψk,j is peaked at the momentum pk = 2kp0. Since the wavelets with
diﬀerent k are orthogonal, the coeﬃcients dk,j =
determine relative amplitudes of
successively shorter wave length components of Ψ in the vicinity of x = 2−kj as k increases.
For this reason, the index j is called a position index, and k is called a resolution level.

(iv). From the physical properties of a system one can estimate a wave length band,
[λmin, λmax], required for simulations. The lowest resolution level l is identiﬁed by the

condition that φl,j span functions with Fourier components in the vicinity of λmax. The

log2(λmax/λmin). In our example
l = 1 and n = 5. If N scaling functions are needed (to cover a given physical volume), then,
in general, on every wavelet resolution level there will be Jk = 2k−lN basis functions. The
wave packet is decomposed in the corresponding basis of Vn

The decomposition coeﬃcients as functions of time are to be found from the Schroedinger
equation. Yet, the total number of coeﬃcients in Ψ(t) is about the same as that in the uniform
ﬁnite lattice approach.

The advantage of using wavelet bases becomes signiﬁcant whenever the volume of regions
where short wave lengths can appear during the time evolution is much smaller than the total
physical volume of the system. This allows one to substantially reduce Jk in Eq.(4) by taking
higher resolution level wavelets only where they are needed.
In our case we need only 20
wavelets at each resolution level. We shall refer to all the wavelets needed in the vicinity of
one local minima of the potential as a wavelet tower. Higher tower ﬂoors correspond to higher
resolution levels k. Each wavelet is thought of as a building block of width equal 2−k.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that wavelet bases can be extremely eﬃcient for
solving the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for multiscale systems. The bound and
continuum states are accurately described with a much less number of basis functions as
would be required in the standard Fourier-grid methods.
In our example we were able to
reduce the basis size by a factor of 50, which allowed us to scale down the computation time
by a factor of 100. The method can easily be implemented in higher dimensions where a
wavelet basis is built by taking the direct product of one-dimensional wavelets [17]. The
wavelet approach becomes more eﬃcient as ratios of typical scales get larger. Finally we
would like to stress that the wavelet method is ideally suitable for simulating wave packet
propagation in multiscale problems with complicated form of the potential. This is because
the wavelet towers can be custom designed for any topology of the potential minima (e.g.,
potential valleys) regardless of the dimensionality of the system.

Abstract

Based on a geometric discretization scheme for Maxwell equations, we unveil a mathematical

transformation between the electric ﬁeld intensity E and the magnetic ﬁeld intensity H, denoted

as Galerkin duality. Using Galerkin duality and discrete Hodge operators, we construct two system

matrices, [XE] (primal formulation) and [XH] (dual formulation) respectively, that discretize the

second-order vector wave equations. We show that the primal formulation recovers the conventional

(edge-element) ﬁnite element method (FEM) and suggests a geometric foundation for it. On the

other hand, the dual formulation suggests a new (dual) type of FEM. Although both formulations

give identical dynamical physical solutions, the dimensions of the null spaces are diﬀerent.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The ﬁnite element method (FEM) originally developed for structure design and analysis

is usually based on nodal elements [1]. Simply applying nodal elements to Maxwell equations

causes problems such as spurious modes [2]. The use of edge elements is the most reasonable

way [3] to remove the spurious modes because the electric ﬁeld intensity E is a diﬀerential

1-form associated with the edges [19]

The basic strategy of traditional FEM (Galerkin’s method) is to seek the solution by

weighting the residual of the second-order wave equations. Here, we adopt a diﬀerent route.

Based on a general discretization scheme for Maxwell equations on irregular lattices, we

construct two system matrices in terms of the electric ﬁeld intensity E (denoted as primal

formulation) and the magnetic ﬁeld intensity H (denoted as dual formulation), respectively.

The primal formulation recovers the FEM based on edge elements, and suggests a geometric

foundation for it. On the other hand, the dual formulation suggests a new (dual) type of

FEM. Although both formulations give identical physical solutions, the dimensions of the

null (kernel) spaces are diﬀerent. The connection between the primal formulation and dual

formulation is established via a transformation, denoted here as Galerkin duality (not to be

confused with conventional electromagnetic duality [5][6])

II. DISCRETE MAXWELL EQUATIONS

Maxwell equations in source-free, three-dimensional (3D) space (in the Fourier domain)

are written in terms of diﬀerential forms [7][8] as

dE = iωB, dB = 0, dH = −iωD, dD = 0

(1)

where E and H are electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensity1-forms, D and B are electric and

magnetic ﬂux 2-forms, and d is the (metric-free) exterior derivative operator. Constitu-

tive equations, which include all metric information, are written in terms of Hodge (star)

operators (that ﬁx an isomorphism between p-forms and (3 − p)-forms) [7]

D = ⋆ǫE , B = ⋆µH

(2)

By applying basic tools of algebraic topology and a discrete analog of diﬀerential forms,

discrete electromagnetic theory can be constructed from ﬁrst principles on a general (irreg-

2

ular) primal/dual lattice (cell-complex) [7]. The discrete Maxwell equations read as [9]

[dcurl] E=iωB, [ddiv] B=0, [d∗

curl] H=−iωD, [d∗

div] D=0

(3)

where E, B, H, D are arrays of degrees of freedom (DoF s) and [dcurl],[ddiv],[d∗

div] are
incidence matrices that encode the discrete exterior derivatives (discrete counterparts to

curl], [d∗

the curl and divergence operators, distilled from their metric structure) on the primal and

dual lattice, respectively. Due to the absence of metric structure, entries of the incidence

matrices assume only {−1, 0, 1} values [7].

The discrete Hodge operators can be, in general, written as follows

D = [⋆ǫ] E, B = [⋆µ] H

(4)

One approach to construct the Hodge matrices [⋆ǫ] and [⋆µ] will be discussed in next Section.

In addition to being non-singular, the Hodge matrices should be symmetric (in reciprocal

media) and positive deﬁnite (in passive media) to obtain stable discretizations for time-

domain simulations [7].

III. DISCRETE HODGE OPERATORS

Let Ω be a n-dimensional diﬀerentiable manifold and F p (Ω) the space of forms of p-

degree deﬁned on it. If Ω is endowed with a metric, then the Hodge operator ⋆ : η → ξ = ⋆η

[10][11] is deﬁned as a map of η ∈ F p (Ω) to ξ ∈ F n−p (Ω) such that for any ψ ∈ F p (Ω)

The Hodge operator deﬁnes (through a metric) an inﬁnite dimensional inner product, de-

noted as (ψ, η)

For some form ψ we can also deﬁne the Hodge square of ψ by

which is positive when the metric is positive deﬁnite. By applying (7) to electric ﬁeld and

magnetic ﬁeld, one can obtain constitutive relations in terms of Hodge operators in 3D

Whitney forms [12] are the basic interpolants for discrete diﬀerential forms of various

degrees deﬁned over tetrahedra. Whitney forms can be expressed in term of the barycentric

coordinates associated with each tetrahedron node (ζi, ζj, ζk, ζr) as [13]

w0

i = ζi

w1

i,j = ζidζj − ζjdζi

w2

i,j,k = 2 (ζidζj ∧ dζk + ζjdζk ∧ dζi + ζkdζi ∧ dζj)



+ζkdζr ∧ dζi ∧ dζj − ζjdζk ∧ dζr ∧ dζi





(See the appendix for the basis functions over cubes). Accordingly, we use Whitney 1-forms

as the interpolants for electric ﬁeld intensity 1-form E, and Whitney 2-forms as interpolants

for the magnetic ﬂux 2-form B

E =

Note that the above expansions guarantee tangential continuity of E and normal continuity

of B simultaneously.

Using these basis functions and the Euclidean metric, matrix representations for the

Hodge operators ⋆ǫ and ⋆µ−1 can be constructed by combining Eq. (8), Eq. (9) and Eq.

It can be shown that [d∗

properties.

B. Galerkin duality

Galerkin duality is a mathematical transformation between the above primal and dual

formulations. Note that Galerkin duality is distinct from usual electromagnetic duality [5][6],

as illustrated in Table I.

Based on Galerkin duality and the discrete Hodge operators introduced before, we can

construct two diﬀerent system matrices for a given problem

[XE] = [⋆ǫ]−1 [d∗

curl] [⋆µ−1] [dcurl]

[XH] = [⋆µ−1] [dcurl] [⋆ǫ]−1 [d∗

curl]

(23)

(24)

Both [XE] and [XH] encode all discrete dynamic information, and hence produce identical

dynamic solutions. However, their null spaces (associated with zero modes) are very diﬀer-

ent. In other words, for a discretization of the same physical system, the dimensions of the

(discrete) zero eigenspaces are diﬀerent under Galerkin duality. This can be explained by

algebraic properties of discrete Hodge decomposition, and veriﬁed by numerical simulations,

as discussed in Section V.

C. A approach to handle Neumann boundary condition

Since Dirichlet boundary condition and Neumann boundary condition are Galerkin dual

to each other for some underlying diﬀerential equations, we propose an approach to handle

Neumann boundary condition. Consider a diﬀerential equation

where Θ is a diﬀerential operator and φ is the unknown physical quantity, with Neumann

boundary condition. By Galerkin duality, this problem is equivalent to solving

with Dirichlet boundary condition. Here Θ† is the Galerkin dual to Θ, and φ† is the Galerkin
dual to φ. φ† can be expanded by basis functions W †
i

For some problems, the beneﬁt of the formulation (26) is that the basis functions W †

i can

be easier to build so that Dirichlet boundary condition is enforced directly. Moreover, the

number of DoF s of discrezation φ† may be considerably smaller than that of φ.

V. EXAMPLES

To demonstrate the Galerkin duality, we provide some numerical simulations for 2D

cavity problems in the (x, y) plane. Both TE and TM cases are simulated. The ﬁnite

element meshes for these examples were generated by using Triangle, a freely available 2D

mesh generator [14]. The angular frequencies of the resonant modes are obtained by solving

the eigenvalue equation (16) (primal formulation) or the eigenvalue equation (17) (dual

formulation). For simplicity, we set ǫ = µ = 1.

Table III and Table IV present the results for TE modes and TM modes of a circular

cavity with radius a = 1. The analytical solutions of TE modes are the zeros of Bessel

function derivative J ′

m (x); The analytical solutions of TM modes are the zeros of Bessel
function Jm (x). Note that T Emn and T Mmn have a twofold degeneracy analytically if

m 6= 0. However, the numerical solutions break the degeneracy. From the Table III (2D

TE modes), we ﬁnd that the number of zero modes of primal formulation is equal to the

other hand, from the Table IV (2D TM modes), we ﬁnd that the number of zero modes of

primal formulation is 0, while the number of zero modes of dual formulation is NF −1. From

the last rows of Table III and Table IV, we conclude that both formulations give the same

number of nonzero modes. These numerical facts, summarized in Table V, will be explained

by applying a discrete Hodge decomposition in next subsection.

brieﬂy discuss next the connection between the discrete Hodge decomposition above and the

Euler’s formula for a network of polygons (for a more details, see reference [9]).

2D TE case

For 2D TE case, applying (35) to the electric ﬁeld intensity E (1-form), we obtain

E1 = dφ0 + δA2

(36)

where φ0 is a 0-form and A2 is a 2-form. In Eq. (36) dφ0 represents the static ﬁeld and δA2

represents the dynamic ﬁeld. We can trace the following correspondence between Euler’s

The l.h.s. of Eq. (40) corresponds to the range space of [XE] while the r.h.s. corresponds to

the range space of [XH] . Furthermore, The L2 corresponds to the null space of [XE] while

R2 corresponds to the null space of [XH] . These results are summarized in Table VI.

Table VI exactly matches Table V from numerical results. The DoF s of system matrices

[XE] and [XH] equal the total number of modes of primal formulation and dual formulation,

respectively. Furthermore, the DoF s in the null space of [XE] and [XH] equal the number

of zero modes of primal formulation and dual formulation, respectively; Finally the DoF s in

the range space of [XE] and [XH] equal the number of nonzero (dynamic) modes of primal

formulation and dual formulation, respectively. Note that in the case of 2D TE modes (the

electric ﬁeld intensity E is a 1-form interpolated by edge elements), it is a well known fact

that the dimension of the null space (# zero modes ) of [XE] is equal to the number of

internal nodes [9][16][17].

From Eq. (40) (Euler’s formula for a network of polygons) it can be concluded that the

dimension of range space of [XE] equals the dimension of range space of [XH]. In fact, this

is a fundamental property of discrete Maxwell equations [9].

D. Polygonal cavity

A 2D cavity of arbitrary shape can be approximated by a polygon as the boundary [9].

Table VII and Table VIII present the results for TE modes and TM modes of a polygonal

cavity (Fig. 2). The results support the above conclusions summarized by Table V and

Table VI. Moreover, both systems matrices [XE] and [XH] are ﬁnite approximation of the

corresponding inﬁnite system. If we use same mesh and same basis functions, that is, same

basic matrices [dcurl], [d∗

curl], [⋆µ−1] and [⋆ǫ], the dynamic physical structure encoded by
system matrices [XE] and [XH] will be same. Furthermore, if we use same linear solver, the

solutions of both formulations will give the identical nonzero modes (dynamic solutions) up

to round oﬀ errors (see Table VII and VIII).

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Based on Galerkin duality and discrete Hodge operators, we construct two system matri-

ces, [XE] (primal formulation) and [XH] (dual formulation) that discretize the wave equa-

tions. It can be shown that the primal formulation recovers the conventional (edge-element)

FEM and suggests a geometric foundation for it. On the other hand, the dual formulation

suggests a new (dual) type of FEM. Although both formulations give identical physical so-

lutions, the null spaces are diﬀerent. The connection between the DoF s can be associated

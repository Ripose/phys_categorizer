Steady-state relaxation and the ﬁrst passage time distribution of the generalized
master equation

In principle, the generalized master equation can be used to eﬃciently compute the macroscopic
ﬁrst passage time (FPT) distribution of a complex stochastic system from short-term microscopic
simulation data. However, computing its transition function matrix, Γ(τ ), from such data can
be practically diﬃcult or impossible. We solve this problem by showing that the FPT moment
generating function is a simple function of the (easily computable) Laplace transform of Γ(τ ). This
reﬂects an intimate relationship between the generating function and steady-state relaxation, which
describes the behavior of an ensemble as the ﬂux rate decreases exponentially, and provides a
computationally eﬃcient means of computing the FPT moments.

Background —Computing the macroscopic transition
rates and ﬁrst passage time (FPT) distributions of com-
plex systems (e.g., proteins) by computational simula-
tions using microscopic equations of motion can be ex-
pensive, if not impossible, particularly when the systems
are large and/or when transitions are rare. In principle,
computation can be simpliﬁed and comprehension can be
enhanced by coarse-graining the microscopic equations to
a macroscopic generalized master equation [1]

with P (−∞) = 0. This describes the time-evolution of
P (t), the ensemble occupation number N -vector deﬁned
over states s, each corresponding to a subregion of the mi-
croscopic phase space, after injection of systems at time
t = 0. Γ(τ ) is the N × N matrix of transition func-
tions, which includes memory eﬀects. Corresponding to
conservation of probability and to causality,

(where 1 is the vector with all components equal to 1).
The task is to determine the rate, or more generally
the FPT distribution, of transitions from an initial state
i to a ﬁnal state f . So as to examine ﬁrst passage times,
we make f an absorptive state:

Γ(τ ) · ˆǫf = 0 ,

where ˆǫs denotes the basis vector which has component
s equal to 1 and all other components 0. Then the FPT
distribution is

so P (∞) = ˆǫf . Therefore,

We assume (as is true in most cases of interest) that ϕ(τ )
decays faster than e−αmaxτ as τ → ∞ for some positive
αmax, so that ˜ϕ(−α) is analytic in a neighborhood about
0 and can be diﬀerentiated to yield all moments. (This
assumption is not essential, but simpliﬁes the discussion.
If it is not true, the discussion will still be valid for the
ﬁnite moments.)

In some cases, Γ(τ ) can be deﬁned from ﬁrst principles.
However, for complicated systems such as proteins it
must be computed from microscopic simulations. In such
cases relatively short (compared to the MFPT) molecular
or Langevin dynamics simulations can be used to deter-
mine −Ks,s′ (τ ) (s 6= s′), the local FPT distribution. This
is the probability density that, after arriving at state s′,
a system waits for an interval τ before ﬁrst leaving and
that it goes to s. The diagonal elements of the N × N
s6=s′ Ks,s′ (τ ),
matrix K(τ ) are deﬁned by Ks,s(τ ) ≡ −
so like Γ(τ ), K(τ ) satisﬁes

and the transition rate is hhτ ϕii−1. We assume that f is

However, in practice the inverse Laplace transform re-
Γ(u) is diﬃcult, if not
quired to determine Γ(τ ) from
impossible, to compute. This precludes the computation
of ϕ(t) by integration of Eq. (1).

e

Faradjian and Elber [3] have recently solved this prob-
lem by showing that Eq. (1) can be reformulated using
either a coupled set of QK equations or a single set of
(pseudo-)Markovian PJ equations that allow dP (t)/dt to
be integrated in t using only K(τ ), not Γ(τ ). For numer-
ical calculation, τ is discretized at the shortest relevant
dynamical time scale h over the interval [0, Tτ ], where Tτ
is the support of K(τ ), and ϕ(τ ) is computed by direct
integration at cost ∼ O(Nc × Tτ × MFPT/h2), where Nc
is the number of non-zero oﬀ-diagonal elements in K(τ ).
Here we show that the FPT moments can be computed
directly from
K(u) without need for an alter-
native formulation. Moreover, the computational cost is
∼ O(NcTτ /h) per moment, which is signiﬁcantly cheaper
than numerical integration in t. This steady-state relax-
ation approach is theoretically interesting because it illu-
minates a fundamental and simple relationship between
the FPT moment generating function and
Γ(u), and is
practically interesting because it provides a potentially
large reduction in computational cost.

Results—We extend Eq. (1) to the case in which sys-
tems are continuously injected into the initial state at
an exponentially decreasing rate exp(−αt) beginning at
t = 0. Eq. (1) becomes

where θ(t) is the Heaviside step function. If α = 0, as
t → ∞ Eq. (8) describes steady-state ﬂow, and we ex-
pect that the occupation numbers in all the interme-
diate states, Ps(t) (s 6= f ), will approach a constant
steady-state solution. We call the case in which α > 0
steady-state relaxation and expect that the intermediate
state occupation numbers will will decay exponentially
as t → ∞. The key point is that the asymptotic steady-
state solution is easy to compute and determines the FPT
generating function as a simple function of

Γ(u).

Since Eqs. (1) and (8) are linear, the systems injected
at diﬀerent times will transition to f independently, so
the rate of accumulation is obtained simply by integrat-
ing Eq. (4) over the incoming ﬂux:

t. As long as t is larger than the support of ϕ(τ ), we can
extend the upper limit of the integral to ∞, and Eq. (9)
can be rewritten as:

˜ϕ(−α) =

Thus, solving Eq. (8) for P (t) when t ≫ 0 determines
the FPT generating function.

We must take care because Γ(τ ) is singular: Eqs. (2)
and (3) imply that it has left null-vector 1 and corre-
sponding right null-vector ˆǫf . Thus, it is convenient to
decompose Eq. (8) by projecting it into the null-space
and the orthogonal space using projection operators P
and Q [4], respectively,

P = ˆǫf ⊗ 1, Q = I − P .

and expanding

P (t) = ˆǫf Ptot(t) + ¯P (t) ,

(11)

where Ptot(t) ≡ 1·P (t) and ¯P (t) ≡ Q·P (t). Substituting
this into Eq. (8) yields the two independent equations

The ﬁrst equation [along with boundary condition
P (−∞) = 0] implies that

Ptot(t) =

(12)

We solve the second equation in the asymptotic regime by
testing the guess that ¯P (t) = ¯P exp(−αt) (t ≫ 0), where
1 · ¯P = 0. Substituting this in, factoring out exp(−αt),
and taking the limit t → ∞ gives

That is, ϕ(τ ) determines the fraction of the ﬂux intro-

(Q · [
is the pseudoinverse of

Γ(−α) − αI.)
This fundamental relationship expresses ˜ϕ(−α) as an
function of the Laplace transform of Γ(τ ) or, using Eq.
(7), as a function of
K(−α). It can be expanded in α to
obtain expressions for the moments. The zeroth moment
is always ˜ϕ(0) = 1, consistent with Eq. (5). The ﬁrst
moment determines the MFPT and is

Taking the limit of Eq. (7) as u → 0 [using Eq. (6)] gives

Γs,s′(0) =

Ks,s′ (0)/hhτ Ks,s′ ii ,

e

e

so the MFPT is completely determined by the zeroth and
ﬁrst moments of K(τ ).

Eq. (14) has a simple interpretation: The steady-state
ﬂux (α = 0) must be equal to the total number of sys-
tems in transit divided by the MFPT. Thus, when the
ﬂux equals 1 (as in this calculation), the MFPT must
be equal to the sum of the occupation numbers in all the
s6=f Ps(t). Eqs. (11) and (13b) im-
intermediate states,
ply that the rhs of Eq. (14) equals (1 − ˆǫf ) · ¯P , which is
identical to this sum.

e

The dominating cost of evaluating the MFPT is that
K(0) and hhτ Kii from K(τ ), which is
of computing
∼ O(NcTτ /h), where Nc is the number of matrix ele-
ments. This is ∼ O(MFPT/h) times more eﬃcient than
computation by integration in t. Eﬃciency can be fur-
ther increased by bypassing the determination of K(τ )
(which requires a somewhat noisy quantization of τ ) and
computing the needed averages directly from the simula-
tion data. Higher moments can be determined, each for

3

the same cost [6], either by computing additional values
of ˜ϕ(−α) near α = 0 and numerically diﬀerentiating or,
Γ(−α) in terms
as for the MFPT, analytically expanding
of hhτ kKii. The latter procedure can be used to com-
pute the ﬁnite moments even when higher moments are
inﬁnite and ˜ϕ(−α) is not analytic at α = 0.

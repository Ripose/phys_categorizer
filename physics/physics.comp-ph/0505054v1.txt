Abstract. A high-frequency asymptotics of the symbol of the Dirichlet-to-
Neumann map, treated as a periodic pseudodiﬀerential operator, in 2D diﬀraction
problems is discussed. Numerical results support a conjecture on a universal limit
shape of the symbol.

Keywords: Kirchhoﬀ approximation; high-frequency asymptotics; Helmholtz
equation; Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator; periodic pseudodiﬀerential operators

1 Introduction

≫

The classical Kirchhoﬀ Approximation (KA) in diﬀraction theory is an asymp-
totic relation between the Dirichlet and Neumann data of a solution of an
exterior boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation with frequency
parameter k
1. The KA is sensitive to the assumption of positive curvature
of the boundary and its accuracy deteriorates in the presence of ﬂattening
regions [9]. Numerical methods for high-frequency problems have attracted
much attention lately – see e.g. [2]. In an attempt to include small and vanish-
ing curvatures uniformly in an asymptotic theory, we propose to study high-
frequency asymptotic properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator
rather than those of an individual solution. In [5], we conjectured that the
pseudodiﬀerential symbol of the DtN operator, appropriately scaled, tends
to a simple universal function as k
. Here we report results of a more
→ ∞
detailed numerical study. The results support the said conjecture in the case
of a convex scatterer. In a non-convex case, we observe a deviation from the
universal limit function in a narrow range of it’s argument values.

Consider the Helmholtz equation ∆u + k2u = 0 in the exterior of a simply
R2 with smooth boundary Γ. Given a
connected bounded domain Ω
function f on Γ of a certain regularity [3, 7], the Dirichlet problem u

3. A simple if not completely rigorous argument shows that the hypothesis

is consistent with KA for a convex domain [5].

Yet we admit that Hypothesis 1 may be true for some classes of boundary
curves and false for others. To restore status quo with numerical experiment,
we formulate a somewhat weaker Hypothesis 2 below.

Note that the symbol σΓ(φ, n; k) generally depends on φ (except when
Γ is a circle), while the limit function is φ-independent. So we are trying
to approximate the DtN operator by a shift-invariant PPDO. It can only be
possible if the Fourier series of the symbol in φ asymptotically reduces to a
single constant term. Put (omitting the subscript Γ in the right-hand side)

σΓ(φ, n; k) = ˆσ0(n; k) + ˆσ±1(n; k)e±iφ + ˆσ±2(n; k)e±2iφ +

To test the hypothesis numerically, we use known sample solutions satisfy-

Computational note. Computation of the Fourier coeﬃcients ˆσm(n; k)
of the symbol requires solution of truncated systems (7). If the cutoﬀ sub-
script is rather large, one has to take trouble to ensure that Fourier coeﬃ-
cients ˆf j(n
m) are not vanishingly small. To this end, the sources should
be placed close to the boundary, preventing the Dirichlet data of sample so-
lutions from being “too smooth”. The reported results are obtained with
sources located at the distance from about 10−2 to 10−3 (for larger values of
k) from Γ.

(Dated: February 20, 2014)

We present numerical evidence indicating that some essential ﬂuid ﬂows at ﬁnite Knudsen number (Kn) can
be quantitatively simulated by an extended lattice Boltzmann model. The extension is based on the kinetic
theory formulation of the lattice Boltzmann method that includes a third order equilibrium distribution function,
a sufﬁciently accurate Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and a regularization procedure. Results from force-driven
Poiseuille ﬂow simulations correctly predict the Knudsen’s minimum and the asymptotic behavior of ﬂow ﬂux
at large Kn.

PACS numbers: 47.11.+j, 51.10.+y, 47.45.Gx, 47.85.Np

Understanding and simulating ﬂuid ﬂows far from equilib-
rium pose a long standing challenge to fundamental statistical
physics as well as to many other science and engineering dis-
ciplines [1, 2]. Due to either rarefaction effects or small geo-
metric scales, such ﬂows are characterized by a ﬁnite Knudsen
number, deﬁned as the ratio between the particle mean free
path, l, and the characteristic length, L, Kn = l/L. At sufﬁ-
cient large Knudsen numbers, many of the continuum assump-
tions breakdown [3]. In particular, the Navier-Stokes equation
and the no-slip boundary condition become inadequate.

Since the Boltzmann equation is valid for describing ﬂuid
ﬂows at any Kn [4], the conventional approach for construct-
ing extended hydrodynamic equations for higher Kn regimes
has been through employing higher order Chapman-Enskog
approximations resulting in, e.g., the Burnett and super Bur-
nett equations. However, this approach encounters both theo-
retical and practical difﬁculties [5, 6]. Alternatively, attempts
have been made to extend the Grad’s 13 moment system [7]
by including contributions of higher kinetic moments [8]. One
major difﬁculty has been the determination of the boundary
condition for these moments because only the lowest few have
clear physical meanings. In addition, due to the complexity in
the resulting equations, application of this method is so far
limited to simple one-dimensional situations. Nevertheless,
the moment based formulation offers an valuable insight into
the basic ﬂuid physics for high Kn ﬂows.

Over the past two decades, the lattice Boltzmann method
(LBM) has developed into an efﬁcient computational ﬂuid dy-
namic (CFD) tool [9]. Due to its kinetic nature, LBM intrin-
sically possesses some essential microscopic physics ingre-
dients and is well suited for handling more general bound-
ary conditions. Certain characteristic phenomena in micro-
channel ﬂows were predicted in LBM simulations at least
qualitatively [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In addition, by intro-
ducing a “stochastic virtual wall collision” process mimick-
ing effects of free particle streaming in a long straight chan-
nel [14], analytically known asymptotic behavior at very large
Kn were also produced [14]. Nevertheless, being historically
developed only to recover ﬂuid physics at the Navier-Stokes
level, the existing LBM schemes used in these studies are not
applicable to high Knﬂows other than for such extremely lim-
ited applications. It is important to develop an LBM method

capable of performing accurate simulations of high Kn ﬂows
in general.

Recently, based on the moment expansion formulation [16],
a systematic theoretical procedure for extending LBM beyond
the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics was developed [17]. In this
work, we present a speciﬁc extended LBM model from this
procedure containing the next order kinetic moments beyond
the Navier-Stokes. A three-dimensional (3D) realization of
this LBM model employs a 39-point Gauss-Hermite quadra-
ture with a sixth order isotropy. In addition, a previously re-
ported regularization procedure [18], that is fully consistent
with the moment expansion formulation, is also incorporated
and extended to the same corresponding order. Simulations
performed with the extended LBM have shown to capture cer-
tain characteristic features pertaining to ﬁnite Knﬂows. There
is no empirical models used in the new LBM.

It is convenient here to interpret the lattice Boltzmann equa-
tion according to the Hermite expansion representation. The
single-particle distribution function at a set of particular dis-
ξa : a = 1,
crete velocity values,
, are used as the
state variables to describe the ﬂuid system. The velocity-
space discretization is shown to be equivalent to projecting
the distribution function onto a sub-space spanned by the lead-
ing N Hermite ortho-normal basis, denoted by HN hereafter,
provided that ξa are the abscissas of a sufﬁciently accurate
Gauss-Hermite quadrature [16, 17]. Adopting the BGK col-
lision model [19], the discrete distribution values, fa, satisfy
the following equation:

truncation level determines the closeness of the above equa-
tion to approximate the original continuum BGK equation.
A Chapman-Enskog analysis reveals that the Navier-Stokes
equation is recovered when the second order moment terms
are retained. As the higher order terms are included, physical
effects beyond the Navier-Stokes can be captured systemati-
cally [17].

In this work we solve Eq. (1) up to the third order, one order

tional LBM models [9]. Here, we also set the temperature
to be constant that is sufﬁcient for our present investigation
of ﬂows at high Kn but low Mach numbers (Ma). Denoting

represents the contribution from the third-order kinetic mo-

dependent viscosity [21] but generally neglected in the con-
ventional lattice Boltzmann models.

According to the previous analysis [17], the Gauss-Hermite
quadrature employed for solving a third-order truncated sys-
tem must be accurate with the polynomials up to the sixth
order. For ease in implementing LBM model on Cartesian co-
ordinates, we use the 3D Cartesian quadrature E39
3,7, obtained
by directly solving the polynomial orthogonal relation [17].
Its 2D projection gives a quadrature E21

weights of both quadratures are provided in Table I. Both

As usual, the “lattice convention” with unity time increment
is used here. An LBM computation is generally carried out
in two steps: the streaming step in which fa at x is moved
to x + ξa, and the collision step in which fa(x) is replaced
with right-hand-side of Eq. (3). When viewed as a projec-
tion of the continuum BGK equation into HN , this process
introduces an error due to the fact that fa generally does not
entirely lie within HN . When the system is not far from equi-
librium, such an error is small and ignorable. On the other
hand, this error can be resolved via an application on fa of a
“regularization procedure” of Chen et al. previously designed
for improvement in stability and isotropy [18]. In terms of
the Hermite expansion interpretation, the regularization pro-
cedure more concisely described as the following. Explicitly,
we split the post-streaming distribution into two parts:

To be noted here is that, whereas the ﬁrst term is entirely due
to the equilibrium part of the distribution, the term related
to a(2) are contributions from the non-equilibrium part. To
our knowledge, the non-equilibrium contribution in the body-
force has not been explicitly considered in the existing LBM
literature. Although it is expected to play an important role at
large Kn, at moderate Kn (
1), no signiﬁcant effects due to
non-equilibrium contribution are found in the numerical ex-
periments in the present work.

The ﬁrst series of numerical simulations performed are for
the benchmark problem of 2D sinusoidal shear wave decay.

×

The decay rate of the peak velocity magnitude is measured
in two sets of simulations. In the ﬁrst set, a sinusoidal wave
with a wavelength (L) of 128 grid spacing is simulated on a
128 periodic domain. The initial velocity ﬁeld is given
128
by ux = u0 sin(y/2πL) and uy = 0. The wave vector is
aligned with the lattice. In the second set, the same sinusoidal
wave is rotated by 45 degrees and simulated on a matching
periodic domain size of 181(= 128√2)
181. The Knudsen
number, deﬁned as Kn = 2τ cs/L, is chosen to be 0.2, where
τ is the relaxation time and cs the sound speed. The purpose
of these tests is to detect any lattice orientation dependent arti-
facts which often plague discrete ﬂuid models especially when
non-equilibrium effects are signiﬁcant. The two sets of simu-
lations were conducted using four representative models: the
popular 2D 9-state (9-s) model (D3Q9), and the new 2D 21-
state (21-s) model based on E21
2,7, both with and without the
regularization process. In discussions hereafter we shall refer
the models without the regularization as the BGK models, and
the ones with regularization the REG models.

In Fig. 1, the dimensionless peak velocity magnitude, nor-
malized by its initial value and measured at the 1/4 width of
wavelength, is plotted against the non-dimensionalized time
normalized by the characteristic decay time t0 = λ2/ν, where
ν = c2
1/2) is kinematic viscosity. As expected, the de-
cay rate of the shear wave for the 9-s BGK model is strongly
dependent on the orientation of the wave vector with respect to
the lattice, indicating a strong anisotropy of the model at this
Kn. Interestingly this anisotropy is essentially eliminated by
the regularization procedure in the resulting 9-s REG model.
However, the amplitude of the shear wave exhibits a strong
oscillatory behavior in addition to the exponential decay, im-
plying a greater than physical ballistic effect. These may
be explained as the following: The non-equilibrium part of
the post-streaming distribution contains contributions from in
principle all moments, which are highly anisotropic due to in-
adequate symmetry in the underlying discrete model to allow
isotropy beyond the second order. The regularization proce-
dure ﬁlters out the higher than the second order moment con-
tributions, yielding an isotropic behavior. On the other hand,
the higher moments are critical at large Kn. Clearly, with and
without the regularization, the 9-s models do not show satis-
factory results at high Knudsen numbers. For the 21-s BGK
model, an anisotropic behavior is also very visible, though at
a much smaller extent. This may be attributed to the resid-
ual anisotropy in the moments higher than the third order.
Again, the anisotropy behavior is removed once the regular-
ization procedure is applied. It is also notable that the decay
history shows a much reduced oscillatory behavior in the 21-s
REG model. It is also curious to observe that the decay of the
“lattice aligned” result from 9s-BGK is surprisingly close to
that of 21-s REG model at this Kn.

Using the same four models, we subsequently carried out
simulations of the force-driven Poiseuille ﬂow for a range of
Knudsen numbers. In these, a periodic boundary condition is
used in the stream-wise (x) direction, and a standard half-way
bounce-back boundary condition is used in the cross-channel

(y) direction. Four grid points are used in the x direction.
In the y direction, two different resolutions, L = 40 and 80
are tried to ensure sufﬁcient resolution independence. The
Knudsen number is deﬁned as Kn = ν/(csL). The ﬂow is
driven by a constant gravity force, g, pointing in the positive
x direction. The magnitude of the force is set to 8νU0/L2,
which would give rise to a parabolic velocity proﬁle with a
peak velocity of U0 in the vanishing Knlimit. For consistence,
a modiﬁed deﬁnition of ﬂuid velocity, u
u + g/2, is used
in f (0)
a . To enforce an incompressible behavior throughout
the simulated Kn range, we choose a sufﬁciently small value
of U0, corresponding to the nominal Mach numbers of Ma(=
10−7, and veriﬁed that
U0/cs)
our results are independent of Ma. The actual resulting ﬂuid
velocity in these simulations can be values much higher than
U0 at higher Kn.

also include two analytical asymptotic solutions [4] for both
small and very large Kn. To be noted ﬁrst is that at the van-
ishing Knlimit, all simulation results agree with each other as
well as with the analytical solution. Also plotted is the exact
Navier-Stokes solution of Q = 1/(12Kn). At higher Kn, the
9-s BGK model captures the Knudsen’s minimum while over-
estimates the ﬂux as previously reported [14]. However, by ﬁl-
tering out moment contributions higher than the second order,
these phenomena completely disappear from the result of 9-
s REG, yielding a purely monotonically decreasing behavior.
The results from both the 21-s BGK and the 21-s REG mod-
els predict a Knudsen minimum which resemble that of the 9-s
BGK except with reduced over-estimation at higher Kn. What
is mostly interesting is that the ﬂux behavior predicted by the
21-s REG exhibits a reversal of curvature at higher Kn, con-
sistent with the analytical solution. The qualitatively differ-
ences seen from these four models suggest that contributions
from moments beyond second order are essential for captur-
ing fundamental physical effects at high-Kn. Although the
high-order moments are implicitly contained in the second-
order BGK model, its dynamics is highly lattice orientation
dependent. In contrary, by incorporating the high-order mo-
ments explicitly and systematically, ﬂow at these Kn values
can indeed be captured in the extended LBM model.

In summary, kinetic based representation offer a well-posed
numerical approach in CFD for simulations of ﬂows at ﬁnite
Kn. In this work we present a speciﬁc extended LBM model
that incorporates the effects of high-order kinetic moments. It
is robust and highly efﬁcient, and demonstrates a capability in
quantitatively capturing certain fundamental ﬂow features at
ﬁnite Knudsen numbers without introducing empirical mod-
eling. It is also clear that the new LBM model is not limited
to speciﬁc uni-directional channel ﬂows involving only lat-
tice aligned orientations. Nevertheless, a number of issues
are awaiting further studies. For even higher Kn ( 100), one
should expect and straightforward to include moment contri-

butions higher than the third order via the systematic proce-
dure [17]. The issue of boundary condition and thermal effect
are also of eminent importance [24, 25, 26], even though the
realization of the essential slip-velocity effect and the asymp-
totic behavior is demonstrated to be attributed to a signiﬁcant
extent to the third order and higher moment contributions in
the intrinsic LBM dynamic system itself. As reported in some
previous works [13, 14], the kinetic boundary condition of
Ansumali and Karlin [27] has lead to substantial improve-
ments at the Navier-Stokes level micro-channel ﬂow simula-
tions. Thermodynamic effect can also be incorporated, as it
is expected to become non-negligible at ﬁnite Mach numbers.
The present third-order model is thermodynamically consis-
tent at the Navier-Stokes level [17]. Another interesting point
to mention is that both the 21-s BGK or the 21-s REG can
allow an expanded equilibrium distribution form including
terms up to the fourth power in ﬂuid velocity (as opposed to
the square power in 9-s BGK), for that the correct equilibrium
energy ﬂux tensor is still preserved. Including the forth power
terms immediately results in a desirable positive-deﬁnite dis-
tribution for the zero-velocity state at all Mach number values.

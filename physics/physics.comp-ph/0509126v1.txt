Abstract— In the ﬁrst work of this series [1] it was shown that the conformational space of
a molecule could be described to a fair degree of accuracy by means of a central hyperplane
arrangement. The hyperplanes divide the espace into a hierarchical set of cells that can be
encoded by the face lattice poset of the arrangement.
The model however, lacked explicit rotational symmetry which made impossible to distinguish
rotated structures in conformational space. This problem was solved in a second work [2] by
sorting the elementary 3D components of the molecular system into a set of morphological classes
that can be properly oriented in a standard 3D reference frame.
This also made possible to ﬁnd a solution to the problem that is being adressed in the present
work: for a molecular system immersed in a heat bath we want to enumerate the subset of cells
in conformational space that are visited by the molecule in its thermal wandering.
If each visited cell is a vertex on a graph with edges to the adjacent cells, here it is explained
how such graph can be built.

I. Introduction

Molecular dynamics simulations (M DS) are an essential tool for the modeling of large and very
large molecules, it gives us a precise and detailed view of a molecule’s behaviour [3]. However, it
has two limitations that hamper many practical applications: it is a random algorithm, as such
it does not perform a systematic exploration of molecular conformational space (CS); and that
currently, the output from an M DS represents only a very small fraction of the volume spanned
by the system in CS.

Here it is presented a complementary approach that locally is less precise but that can encompass
a broader view of CS. It consists in dividing the CS into a ﬁnite set of cells, so that the only
knowledge we seek about the system is whether it can be located in a given cell or not.

As was extensively discussed in ref.

[1] the partition is a variant of the AN partition [4-5]: a

central2 arrangement of hyperplanes that divides CS into a set of cells shaped as polyhedral
cones, such that for a molecule with N atoms we have (N !)3 cells. The set of hyperplanes is
also a Coxeter reﬂection arrangement: the arrangement is invariant upon reﬂection on any of the
hyperplanes.

This structure has three important properties [1]:

1. Associated with a Coxeter arrangement there is a polytope [5] whose symmetry group is
the reﬂection group of the arrangement. The face lattice poset3 of the polytope is a
hierarchichal combinatorial structure that enables us to manage the sheer complexity of
CS, since with simple codes we can describe from huge regions down to single cells.

2. The information needed to encode any face in the polytope is a sequence of 3 × N inte-
gers, which is a generalization of a structure known to combinatorialists as non-crossing
partition sequence [5,6].

3. The construction is modular: if we consider the CS of two subsets of atoms from a system,
the CS of the union set has an associated polytope that is the cartesian product of the
polytopes4 of the two subspaces, and its partition sequence is the ordered union of the two
partition sequences [1].

The last one is particularly important since the CS of the whole system can be built from that
of the parts, and the CS of a small number of atoms is very much smaller than that of the
whole molecule and we can reasonably assume that it can be thoroughly explored by an M DS.
Moreover, in merging the CSs corresponding to subsets of atoms the number of cells grows
exponentially while the length of coding sequences grows only linearly.

II. The basic construction

Let (e1, ..., eN ) be the standard basis in RN , the convex hull of the endpoints of the vectors {ei}
is a regular (N−1)-simplex : this gives a segment, an equilateral triangle and a tetrahedron in
2, 3 and 4 dimensions respectively.

For each edge of the regular (N−1)-simplex there is an hyperplane Hij : xi −xj = 0, perpendicular
to the edge and containing the other vertices, this hyperplane divides RN in three regions. A
point x can be in one of these :

• xi > xj the positive side, where the ith coordinate dominates the jth coordinate,
• xi < xj the negative side, whith the jth the coordinate dominating the ith coordinate,
• xi = xj on the plane.

This leads to a sign vector S for every point x ǫ RN , where the αth component Xα ǫ {+, −, 0}
denotes wether x is on the positive side of Hα, on its negative side or lies on Hα.

Also notice that the line x1 = x2 = ... = xN −1 = xN is contained in every plane Hij, if the
orthogonal complement to this line is U : x1 + x2 + ... + xN −1 + xN = 0, we can deﬁne a partition

2That pass through the origin.
3The faces in the induced decomposition of the polytope ordered by inclusion.
4If P ⊂ Rp and Q ⊂ Rq are polytopes the product polytope P × Q has the set of vertices (x, y) ǫ Rp+q where x
and y are vertices of P and Q respectively.

2

on U, known to combinatorialists as AN−1 [4-5], with the set of hyperplanes Hij = U ∩ Hij. For
reasons that are explained below the points outside U are not relevant to our construction.

The set of all points x ǫ U having the same sign vector S form a cell in the decomposition of
U induced by AN−1, associated to this secomposition is the following important structure : the
face poset, which is the set of all cells induced by AN −1 ordered by inclusion. The maximal cells
(all (N−1)-dimensional) are called regions and are shaped as polyhedral cones, the coordinates
of the points in the interior of a region obey the relation :

xi1 < xi2 < ... < xiN−1 < xiN

(1)

the dominance relations (1) between the coordinates can be encoded by the sequence

(i1)(i2) ... (iN −1)(iN )

(2)

thereafter referred as the cell dominance partition sequence (DP S), where the set of indices
iα is a permutation of (1, 2, ..., N −1, N ). Each index appears enclosed between parenthesis for
reasons that will be made clear in the next section.

Reﬂecting a point in general position on Hij gives an image where the coordinates i and j are
switched and the others are left unchanged. Multiple reﬂections of a point on the hyperplanes
Hij generate a set of N ! images which are the permutations of its coordinates. This leads to the
N
2 (cid:1) hyperplanes form a Coxeter reﬂection arrangement [7] whose symmetry group
fact that the (cid:0)
is isomorphic to the symmetric group SN of permutations of the set (1, 2, ..., N −1, N ).

The reﬂection group AN −1 is also the symmetry group of a polytope: the N -permutohedron or
ΠN −1 [5], so called because its vertices are obtained by permuting the coordinates of the vector
(1, 2, ..., N −1, N ). The faces of the the permutohedron are polar to the cells of the hyperplane
arrangement and the face lattices of both are isomorphic.

For a molecule with N atoms as the x, y and z coordinates are independent of each other [1]
3 for the whole CS. As it has been
we have a AN −1 partition for each of them, that is AN −1
emphasized in [1-2] the −1 is because of the translation symmetry : the conformations outside
the hyperplane U correspond to translated 3D structures.

The radial dimension in CS is also spurious: multiplying the coordinates of an arbitrary 3D
conformation by a positive factor generates a set of points lying on a half-line starting at the
origin. The partition AN −1 is central because that takes into account the scaling symmetry.

3 on the other hand does not take into account the rotation symmetry [2], the solution of

AN −1
this problem and its consequences will be discussed in sections IV to VII.

III. The face lattice poset

The combinatorial structure of the AN −1 face poset is the fundamental concept behind this work,
it can be understood by studying a class of objects called tournaments which are directed
graphs with N nodes [8], these are used to investigate the properties of permutations, so useful
for characterizing the cells in CS.

A permutation of a set of N elements can be represented by an acyclic, complete and labelled
tournament (see ﬁg. 1 for a description), where :

• The term acyclic means that the graph contains no directed cycles.

• A graph is complete if there is always an arc between any two nodes, if an arc goes from i
to j we say that i dominates j. The score of a node is the number of nodes it dominates.

• Each node of the graph has a unique label which is a number between 1 and N that

distinguishes it from the other nodes.

In what follows the term tournament refers exclusively to tournaments where the above qualiﬁers
apply.

Figure 1.

a) A complete acyclic tournament corresponding to the permutation (3, 6, 1, 4, 2, 5) which is the score of each vertex
plus 1, the indices in the dominance sequence of vertices (3)(5)(1)(4)(6)(2) correspond to the inverse permutation.

b) The antisymmetric incidence matrix, the rows in the upper triangle form the sign vector.

For a tournament with N nodes the following statements are true :

I. In a tournament there is always a node called the sink that is dominated by every other

node.
Consider the last node of any maximal directed path, if an arc connects it to another node
then either the path is not maximal or there is a cycle; if there were another sink it would
be connected to the former and either it would dominate or be dominated.

II. In a tournament there is always a node called the source that dominates every other node.

III. Any subgraph of a tournament is also a tournament.

Any subgraph from a complete graph is also complete, and it can contain no cycles otherwise
they would also be present in the parent graph.

IV. There is one maximal path that spans the graph.

Consider the subtournament obtained by removing the source, then start the path with the
arc that goes from the source to the subsource, and repeat the same step with the subgraph

4

until you reach the sink. The path obtained goes through every node since there are N − 1
steps, and is maximal since skipping a subsource for another node shortens the path since
the node is dominated by the subsource.

V. The sequence of labels of the nodes visited by the maximal path is the dominance partition

sequence.
By the construction procedure the ﬁrst node, the source, dominates all other nodes, the
second dominates the remaining nodes and so on.

Theorem 1. In a tournament the arcs between a set of consecutive nodes in the maximal path
can be arbitrarily reversed and the resulting graph still be a tournament if the subgraph spanning
the consecutive nodes is a tournament.

Since the subgraph and its complement are tournaments they contain no cycles, thus a cycle
must involve nodes between the subgraph and the complement, but this is not possible since by
construction the set of consecutive nodes is dominated by the preceeding nodes in the maximal
path and likewise it dominates the following ones.

By V reversing an arc between contiguous nodes is equivalent to a transposition in the DP S.

Theorem 2. In a tournament encoded by (i1)(i2) ... (iα) ... (iα+n−1) ... (iN −1)(iN ) the permu-
tations in the set of n consecutive indices iα ... iα+n−1 give a set of tournaments that encode the
vertices of an n-permutohedron.

If we restrict ourselves to the n-dimensional subspace spanned by the coordinates (xiα, ..., xiα+n−1 )
the permutations of the indices above corresponds to the permutations of the coordinates of the
vector (α, α + 1, ..., α + n − 1) which are the vertices of a Πn−1.

Corollary. The n-permutohedron is a face of ΠN −1.

Obviously since it is contained in the aﬃne hyperplane xiα +xiα+1 +...+xiα+n−1 = n(α+(n−1)/2).
This face is encoded by the DP S

(i1)(i2) ... (iα ... iα+n−1) ... (iN −1)(iN )

(3)

that represents the set of n! sequences that are permutations of the indices iα to iα+n−1.

Corollary. The sequence (i1)(i2) ... (iα ... iα+n−1) ... (iβ ... iβ+m−1) ... (iN −1)(iN ) encodes the
(n + m − 2)-face Πn−1 × Πm−1.

This can be seen from the deﬁnition given above of the product of polytopes.

Thus the meaning of parenthesis in DP Ss becomes apparent : each parenthesis enclosing a
sequence of length n encodes an Πn−1 polytope, and the whole sequence encodes the product of
all these polytopes.

These sequences can be ordered by inclusion to form a face lattice poset, which is isomorph to
the one obtained with the sign vectors, since like DP Ss they are another encoding scheme for
tournaments [1].

This is an important feature because it implies the modularity of the model: the face lattice of
a molecule can be obtained as the product of the face lattices of subsets of atoms.

IV. Enumerating the orientations of a simplex

For a simplex with random morphology we deﬁne the set of vectors that run along the edges and
their associated central planes (ﬁgs. 2a and 2b)

b) The partition of 3D-space by the planes Eij represented as intersecting disks centered at the origin, visible 3D
cells are designated by their sign vector and 1-dimensional cells are labelled by the corresponding f... symbols (7).

This partition has the following interesting property: assume for instance that the x axis of a
central orthogonal reference system in general position lies entirely within the cell encoded by
the permutation (3, 1, 4, 2), or equivalently the sign vector (+ − + − −+), then the dominance
relation v2x < v4x < v1x < v3x holds for the x coordinates of the vertices of the simplex.

numerous (3, 3, 3)-dimensional cells can be easily obtained through the connecting paths in the

The 1-dimensional cells in A3 are determined by the set of vectors perpendicular to the faces of
the simplex and to pairs of opposite edges

f123 = e12 ∧ e23 , f124 = e12 ∧ e24 , f134 = e13 ∧ e34 , f234 = e23 ∧ e34 ,
f12 = e12 ∧ e34 , f13 = e13 ∧ e24 , f14 = e14 ∧ e23

that up to a sign reversal is an invariant [4,9], it is the same for any simplex whatever its
morphology. The rows are the sign vectors of the 1-dimensional cells with the corresponding
dominance partition sequence on the righ, these cells can be seen in ﬁg. 2b where the labels fijk
and fij are on top of the lines intersected by the planes Eij, Eik, Ejk and Eij, Ekl respectively.

We start by enumerating the orientations of a reference system whose z axis is parallel to one
of the vectors (7), f123 for example, the remaining axis x and y will be on the plane F123, the
problem is to determine how the Eijs (5) divide this plane into 2-dimensional cells. In ﬁg. 3 we
can see the four possible 12-sector partitions that can be generated by the vectors e12, e13 and
e23 and the perpendicular intersections of the planes E12, E13 and E23. This partition gives us
only half of the sign vectors components, to obtain the remaining ones we need to introduce a
morphological classiﬁcation of simplexes.

V. Morphological classification of simplexes

For a given simplex, like the one in ﬁg. 2a for instance, we compute the sign of the scalar products
of the vectors (4) and (7) between them, this gives the following two tables

Within ﬁgs. a to d the vector f123 points in the upward direction, the labels e12, e13 and e23 are over the lines that
run along these vectors, and the corresponding perpendicular lines are the intersections with the planes E12, E13
and E23 respectively. The label f
ijk means that the corresponding line runs along the projection of vector fijk on
F123. The labels f
12 over the intersection of plane E12, for instance, is because f124 and f12 are contained
in that plane, and reciprocally e12 is contained in the planes F124 and F12.
All these lines converge at the origin and partition F123 in 12 sectors : between the inner and outer circles are
the sign vector components of e12, e13 and e23, for each sector they should be read from inside out in that order;

It should be reminded that this classiﬁcation has a graph structure, since geometrical deformations
in a simplex from one class induce a transition to other classes thus establishing a connectivity
between them; the precise structure of such a graph is of no utility in the present work, but the
concept is important when we will introduce below the dynamical states of a simplex.

The binary sequence (9) is instrumental in ﬁnding the partition of the planes perpendicular to
1-dimensional cells, in our exemple it can be deduced from (9) that the partition of F123 is the
one of ﬁg. 3c, since it is the only one that satisﬁes the relation

(SIGN (e12.e13), SIGN (e12.e23), SIGN (e13.e23)) = (+ − +)

There are also the relations concerning vectors e14, e24 and e34

(SIGN (e14.e12), SIGN (e14.e13), SIGN (e14.e23)) = (+ + +)
(SIGN (e24.e12), SIGN (e24.e13), SIGN (e24.e23)) = (− − +)

end up with two possible partitions of F123 that are shown in ﬁg. 4.

As can be seen from ﬁg. 4 each partition generates 12 2-dimensional cells and the same number
in one dimension, by construction the lines along the 1-dimensional cells are never perpendicular
to each other, as a consequence for an (x, y) reference system centered at the origin if one of the
axis runs along the edge of a sector the other will be located inside a sector: rotating the axis
system enables us to scan 12 (1, 2, 3) and 12 (2, 1, 3) dimensional cells (see ﬁg. 4).

Thus for any orientation structure associated with a plane F..., a reference system with one axis
perpendicular to the plane can be in 2 × 12 × 6 cells with dimensions any permutation of the
sequence (3, 2, 1) in (x, y, z). This solves the problem of enumerating the cells with the lowest
possible dimensions that correspond to an orientation of the simplex, the (3, 3, 3)-dimensional
cells can be found from these through the connecting paths in the A3

3 cell lattice poset.

Figure 4. The two possible orientation structures of F123.

′
The thick lines are the intersections of Eij with F123, the thin ones are lines along the vectors eij and e
ij. The sign
vectors of the 2-dimensional cells lie inside the circle, the 1-dimensional ones are outside along the corresponding

partition line, they should be read from inside out. An (X,Y) axis system has been superimposed on the ﬁrst

structure as a visual aid to show how the sectors can be scanned.

Thus for any orientation structure associated with a plane F..., a reference system with one axis
perpendicular to the plane can be in 2 × 12 × 6 cells with dimensions any permutation of the
sequence (3, 2, 1) in (x, y, z). This solves the problem of enumerating the cells with the lowest
possible dimensions that correspond to an orientation of the simplex, the (3, 3, 3)-dimensional
cells can be found from these through the connecting paths in the A3

3 cell lattice poset.

VI. The conformational space of a simplex

We have seen that the binary sequences (9) cannot deﬁne unambiguous partitions of the planes
F... : for each Fijk there can be between 1 and 3 possible orientation structures, and between 1
and 24 for each Fij; in a given class only a fraction of the combinations between the diﬀerent
orientation structures, one from each plane, give geometrically realizable simplexes.

To remove ambiguities we need to deﬁne a set B of morphological classes such that for each one
the range of geometrical variation only allows one orientation structure per F.... An empirical
Monte Carlo calculation yields a total of 125712 classes of labelled simplexes, a class A has
a number of subclasses B that goes from a minimum of 1 up to a maximum of 220. These
morphological subclasses have the remarkable property that for a 3D conformation any cell in
the volume can be reached through a rotation, which is is an obvious consequence of the one to
one correspondence between F... planes and orientation structures.

Thus a class A can be decomposed into a set of subclasses B, that can be unambiguously oriented
in a standard 3D reference frame, and its volume in CS is simply the union of the volumes of its
subclasses.

10

VII. The orientation structures

To achieve a morphological classiﬁcation of simplexes we need to know how many classes of
orientation structures there are, since the classes A decompose into subclasses B and each of
these is determined by 7 orientation structures.

′
A ﬁrst classiﬁcation concerns the circular order of the vectors e
ij in the plane Fα. This can be
deduced from the set of signs (9), for instance : by (4) and (7) the shortest circular path going
′
′
′
23 must be less than π, and it runs counter-clockwise if the sign of F123.Fα
13 and e
12, e
through e
is +.

This exemple leads to the general solution that was discussed in [2] : the 7 vectors (7) deﬁne
a central partition dual to A3 [9] that divides the 3D space in 32 cells. The sign vector of the
cell that contains Fα deﬁnes the sense of the shortest circular path that connects the projected

23}. This generates a set of 7 constraints from which the circular order of
14, e
24} and {e
13, e
{e
′
the e
ijs in Fα can be deduced, making a total of 32 possible circular orientations.

′
As can be seen in ﬁg. 4 on the plane Fα each e
ij contributes a total of 4 separations between
sectors at periodic intervals of 90o each comprising exactly 6 sectors, on the other hand there
′
are two classes of separations : either a line along the vector e
ij or the intersection of a plane
Hij, in an interval of 90o the possible distributions of the two separators amounts to a total of 25
combinations. This makes 1024 classes of orientation structures like those in ﬁg. 4, among these
48 appear to be not geometrically realizable since they are not found in any class B.

VIII. Determination of the graph of cells

Most often in mesoscopic models of biological macromolecules atoms are represented as point-like
structures surrounded by an atomic force ﬁeld [10,11], thus any four atoms are the vertices of
a 3-simplex. Also for a molecular system with N atoms an order relation can be deﬁned by
numbering its atoms from 1 to N , so that 3-simplexes can be designated as a 4-tuple of ordered
integers which are the numbers of its atoms.

Beyond the orientation problem, the classes A and B bring the possibility of analizing the dy-
namics of a molecular system in terms of discrete entities, the range of morphological variation
for simplexes within a molecule can be explored in molecular dynamics simulations (M DS) and
the results can be summarized as follows [2,12]

• 90% of simplexes in a structure evolve within less than 20 classes A.

• The maximum variation observed is somewhat less than 200 classes, about 5% of the total.

This result opens up the possibility of determining the set of geometrically accesible cells in the
CS of a molecular system.

The CS of a simplex has a total of 13824 cells and, typically, the volume of a class A is about one
third of that number, much less if we exclude structures that can be derived through a rotation.
This volume is very small when compared to the huge number of cells spanned by a molecular
system, and it can be reasonably assumed that the volume of a simplex can be scanned by a
molecular dynamics run. What cannot be scanned by a simulation is the set of structures that
arise by combining the local movements.

11

MDSs can be used to determine the subgraph of classes spanned by every simplex, and the volume
of the molecular system in CS can be obtained by progressively merging the CS of individual
simplexes. As we were able to determine the diﬀerent orientations of a simplex this process can
be done excluding redundant rotated structures.

Before proceeding further let us show with a simple exemple the basic operations that are involved
in the process of merging CSs.
If we have two adjoining simplexes Sα and Sβ represented
by the tetrads {14, 33, 82, 86} and {14, 82, 86, 91} respectively (notice that their common faces
correspond to the vertices (v1, v3, v4) and (v1, v2, v3)), if the 3D structure of Sα is in a cell encoded
by the dominance partition sequence

((82)(14)(86)(33), (33)(82)(86)(14), (86)(14)(33)(82))

(13)

then the set cells in CSβ geometrically compatible with (13) will be those whose DP S contains
the pattern

((82)(14)(86), (82)(86)(14), (86)(14)(82))

Thus a cell in CSβ with DP S

((82)(91)(14)(86), (91)(82)(86)(14), (86)(14)(91)(82))

can be merged with (13) and generates the set of 4 cells in CSα × CSβ

((82)(91)(14)(86)(33), (33 91)(82)(86)(14), (86)(14)(33 91)(82))

(16)

which corresponds to a square face in the polar polytope.

(14)

(15)

To calculate the graph of the geometrically accesible cells we begin by picking an arbitrary
reference simplex, preferably one with low morphological variation, and arbitrarily choose an
orientation among those available, this will be the simplex on level 1, the simplexes adjacent to
this one form the level 2, and so on. Since adjacent simplexes in a 3D structure share three
vertices the shortest adjacency path between any two of them has at most length 4, so we end
up with simplexes in 5 levels.

We need not to include every simplex from the molecule to perform a useful calculation, but
N
there is the minimum requirement that every pair of atoms from a total of (cid:0)
2 (cid:1) should be present
at least once in a 4-tuple, otherwise the DP Ss could not be determined.

The calculation can be done through the following procedure :

1. Start at level 1.

in level n + 1.

2. From any simplex in level n we select the compatible orientations in the adjoining simplexes

3. From any simplex in the level n + 1 we select compatible orientations on the adjoining

simplexes at the same level.

4. If n < 5 we go to step 2 and continue with level n + 1.

A link is created between any two compatible orientations in adjacent simplexes. This is done in
two steps:

1. If the simplex in the lower level has not yet been visited any orientation compatible with

those from the simplex in the upper level is selected.

12

2. Otherwise any orientation that has not been selected is discarded. And likewise an orienta-
tion that fails to form a link with an adjacent simplex is discarded because of geometrical
inconsistency.

The implementation of this procedure as an eﬃcient computer algoritm requires that the CS
of a class A simplex be quickly searched for orientations compatible with those from the ad-
joining simplexes, these can be obtained from the set of orientation structures available to each
1-dimensional cell F... (7). This requirement can be fulﬁlled by building a hash table from where
the DP Ss like (15) can be retrived, such table has the following set of entries :

3. the 1-dimensional F... cell (7) corresponding to the orientation structure, numbered from 1

1. the number of the orientation class : from 1 to 976,

2. the connecting face, numbered from 1 to 4,

to 7,

4. the chirality of the simplex: right or left-handed,

5. the pattern (14), of a total of 216 possible patterns.

IX. Conclusion

The aim of the present work has been to bring the sheer complexity of molecular conformational
space to tractable dimensions, by building a structure that encodes the set of geometrically acce-
sible 3D-conformations of a thermalized molecule, and putting it in a compact and manageable
code. The price to pay to achieve this result is the loss of the absolute precision over the local
3D-conformations of molecular structures [1], but this has no concern with this work since we
only seek to obtain a global view of conformational space. From this point of view the present
formalism may be a useful complement of molecular dynamics simulations that in the detailed
exploration of small regions is unexcelled.

What remains to be done is to explore the graph of cells with a Hamiltonian functional over a
force ﬁeld and perform energy optimizations. It should be emphasized that as a Hamiltonian is a
function of distances between atoms the present structure oﬀers the possibility of calculating the
energy over entire regions of CS, since the interatomic distances can be enumerated for a set of
cells and in this case the energy function is nothing else than an integral over a rational function.

SUMMARY

A simple upwind discretization of the highly coupled non-linear diﬀerential equations which deﬁne the
hydrodynamic model for semiconductors is given in full detail. The hydrodynamic model is able to
describe inertia eﬀects which play an increasing role in diﬀerent ﬁelds of opto- and microelectronics. A
silicon n+ − n − n+-structure is simulated, using the energy-balance model and the full hydrodynamic
model. Results for stationary cases are then compared, and it is pointed out where the energy-balance
model, which is implemented in most of today’s commercial semiconductor device simulators, fails to
describe accurately the electron dynamics. Additionally, a GaAs n+ − n − n+-structure is simulated
in time-domain in order to illustrate the importance of inertia eﬀects at high frequencies in modern
submicron devices. Copyright c(cid:13) 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. Introduction

Our paper emerges from the the fact that today’s submicron semiconductor devices are
operated under high frequencies and strong electric ﬁelds. Information transmission using
electromagnetic waves at very high frequencies will have a direct impact on how we design
active and passive components in diﬀerent ﬁelds of micro- and optoelectronics. In such cases,
quasi-static semiconductor device models like the energy-balance model (EBM) are no longer
adequate. Especially in GaAs and related materials used for high-speed device design, inertia
eﬀects play an important role since the impulse and energy relaxation times of the electron
gas are close to the picosecond range.

The most elaborate and practicable approach for the description of charge transport in
semiconductors used for device simulation would be the Monte Carlo (MC) method [1].
The advantage of this technique is a complete picture of carrier dynamics with reference
to microscopic material parameters, e.g. eﬀective masses and scattering parameters. But the

method must be still considered as very time consuming and hence not economical to be used
by device designers.

Besides the simplest concept which is the traditional drift-diﬀusion model (DDM), there is
a much more rigorous approach to the problem, namely the so-called hydrodynamic model
(HDM). This model makes use of electron temperature (or energy density) as additional
quantities for the description of charge transport. Starting from the Boltzmann equation,
Blotekjaer [2] and many others presented a derivation of such equations for the ﬁrst time. The
physical parameters used in the HDM can be obtained from theoretical considerations or MC
simulations. A simpliﬁed version of the HDM is the so-called energy-balance model (EBM).

In the ﬁrst part of this work, we give a short deﬁnition of the charge transport models. We
will illustrate how the diﬀerent models and their parameters can be related to each other. In
a second part, we give a simple discretization scheme for the full hydrodynamic model. In the
last part, we compare the diﬀerent models for the case of a submicron silicon ballistic diode
(an n+ − n − n+ structure) and a Gallium Arsenide ballistic diode.

2. The HDM for silicon

Since we will
illustrate the HDM for the case of an n-doped ballistic diode where the
contribution of electron holes to the current transport is negligible, we will only discuss the
charge transport models for electrons. Generalization of the models to the case where both
charge carriers are present is straightforward.

charge, ~E = −~∇Φ the electric ﬁeld, Φ the quasi-static electric potential, T the electron gas
temperature, ω the electron energy density, κ the thermal conductivity, ǫ is the dielectric
constant, and ND is the density of donors.

The particle current density ~j = n~v is related to the current density ~J by the simple formula

Eq. (1) is simply the continuity equation which expresses particle number conservation. Eq.
(2) is the so-called impulse balance equation, eq. (3) the energy balance equation and eq. (4)
the well-known Poisson equation.

TIME-DOMAIN SIMULATION OF THE FULL HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL

163

We will solve the hydrodynamic equations for n,~j, ω and Φ. To close the set of equations,
we relate the electron energy density to the thermal and kinetic energy of the electrons by
assuming parabolic energy bands

ω =

nkT +

nmv2

.

In fact, we already assumed implicitly parabolic bands for the impulse balance equation, which
is usually given in the form

∂~p
∂t

+ (~∇~p)~v + (~p~∇)~v = −en ~E − ~∇(nkT ) − ~p
τp

,

i.e. we replaced the electron impulse density by the particle current density by assuming
~p = mn~v, where m is a constant eﬀective electron mass.

The impulse relaxation time τp describes the impulse loss of the electron gas due to the
interaction with the crystal, the energy relaxation time τω the energy transfer between the
electron gas with temperature T and the crystal lattice with temperature TL. τp and τω are
usually modelled as a function of the total doping density ND + NA where NA is the density
of acceptors, the lattice temperature TL, the electron temperature T or alternatively the mean
energy per electron ω/n.

A simpliﬁcation of the full HDM is the energy-balance model. In the EBM, the convective
terms of the impulse balance equation are skipped. The energy balance equation is simpliﬁed by
the assumption that the time derivative of the mean electron energy ∂ω/∂t is small compared
to the other terms and that the kinetic part in ω can also be neglected, i.e.

This non-degenerate approximation which avoids a description by Fermi integrals is justiﬁed
for the low electron densities in the relevant region of the simulation examples, where velocity
overshoot can be observed.

The energy balance equation then becomes

ω =

and the impulse balance equation becomes the current equation

(cid:16)

Continuity equation and Poisson equation are of course still valid in the EBM. Neglecting
the time derivative of the current density is equivalent to the assumption that the electron
momentum is able to adjust itself to a change in the electric ﬁeld within a very short time.
While this assumption is justiﬁed for relatively long-gated ﬁeld eﬀect transistors, it needs to
be investigated for short-gate cases.

A further simpliﬁcation of the EBM leads to the drift-diﬀusion model. The energy balance
equation is completely removed from the set of equations, therefore it is no longer possible to

include the electron temperature T in the current equation. T is simply replaced by the lattice
temperature TL. Therefore the DDM consists of the continuity equation, the Poisson equation
and the current equation

~j = − eτp

and it is assumed that the electron mobility is a function of the electric ﬁeld. But at least, the
electron temperature is taken into account in an implicit way: If one considers the stationary
and homogeneous case in the HDM, where spatial and temporal derivatives can be neglected,
one has for the current equation

This is the well-known Caughey-Thomas mobility model [3]. It has the important property
that v(E) ∼ µ0E for E << vs

µ0 and v ∼ vs for E >> vs
µ0 .

The EBM has the big advantage that it includes the electron temperature T , such that the
electron temperature gradient can be included in the current equation, and the mobility can
be modelled more accurately as a function of T .

An expression is needed for the thermal conductivity of the electron gas, which stems from

theoretical considerations

(19)

Several diﬀerent choices for r can be found in the literature, and many authors [4, 5] even
neglect heat conduction in their models. But Baccarani and Wordeman point out in [6] that
neglecting this term can lead to nonphysical results and mathematical instability. Although
their work is directed to Si, their remarks should be equally valid for GaAs since the equations
have the same form in both cases. We will present a GaAs MESFET simulation comparable
to the one of Ghazaly et al. [5] in a forthcoming paper, but with heat conduction included.
The best value for r appears to be −2.1 for silicon at 300 K, according to comparisons of
hydrodynamic and MC simulations of the ballistic diode [7].

3. Discretization scheme

Today, many elaborate discretization methods are available for the DDM equations or EBM
equations. The well-known Scharfetter-Gummel method [9] for the DDM makes use of the fact
that the current density is a slowly varying quantity. The current equation is then solved exactly
under the assumption of a constant current density over a discretization cell, which leads to
an improved expression for the current density than it is given by simple central diﬀerences. It
is therefore possible to implement physical arguments into the discretization method. Similar
techniques have been worked out for the EBM [10]. But due to the complexity of the HDM
equations, no satisfactory discretization methods which include physical input are available for
this case. For the one dimensional case, this is not a very big disadvantage, since the accuracy
of the calculations can be improved by choosing a ﬁner grid, without rising very strongly the
computation time.

Therefore, we developed a shock-capturing upwind discretization method, which has the
advantage of being simple and reliable. For our purposes, it was suﬃcient to use a homogeneous
mesh and a constant time step. But the method can be generalized without any problems to
the non-homogeneous case. Also a generalization to two dimensions causes no problems, and
we are currently studying two dimensional simulations of GaAs MESFETs.

The fact that the discretization scheme is fully explicit should not mislead to the presumption
that it is of a trivial kind. In fact, stabilizing a fully explicit discretization scheme for such a
highly non-linear system of diﬀerential equations like the HDM is a diﬃcult task, and a slight
change in the discretization strategy may cause instabilities. Therefore, naive application of
the upwind method does not lead to the desired result. The order how the diﬀerent quantities
are updated is also of crucial importance for the maximal timesteps that are allowed. The
timesteps can be enhanced by using an implicit scheme, but only at the cost of an increased
amount of computations needed for the iterative numerical solution of the implicit nonlinear
equations.

The device of length l is decomposed into N cells Ci of equal length ∆x = l/N . ’Scalar’
quantities like the electron density ni, (i = 1, ...N ), the potential Φi and the electron energy
density ωi are thought to be located at the center of the cells, whereas ’vectorial’ quantities
like the particle current ji+1/2, (i = 1, ...N − 1) and the electric ﬁeld Ei+1/2 = (Φi − Φi+1)/∆x
are located at the boundaries of the cells. If necessary, we can deﬁne e.g. Ei by

Ei =

(Ei−1/2 + Ei+1/2)

,

(20)

but a diﬀerent deﬁnition will apply to e.g. ji, as we shall see.

The fundamental variables that we will have to compute at each timestep are ni, Φi, ωi (or
Ti) for i = 2, ...N − 1, and ji+1/2 for i = 1, ...N − 1, if n1, nN , Φ1, ΦN , ω1, and ωN are ﬁxed
by boundary conditions. All other variables used in the sequel should be considered as derived
quantities.

The constant timestep ∆t used in our simulations was typically of the order of a few tenths

of a femtosecond, and quantities at time T = t∆t carry an upper integer index t.

Having calculated nt

i for a timestep t, we deﬁne the electron density at the midpoint by

The upwind extrapolation of the electron density which is given by the weighting factors 3/2

4. Stationary simulation results

We simulated an n+ − n − n+ ballistic diode, which models the electron ﬂow in the channel of
a MOSFET, and exhibits hot electron eﬀects at scales on the order of a micrometer. Our diode
begins with an 0.1 µm n+ ”source” region with doping density ND = 1018cm−3, is followed
by an 0.1 µm n ”channel” region (ND = 2 · 1015cm−3), and ends with an 0.1 µm n+ ”drain”
region (again ND = 1018cm−3). The doping density was slightly smeared out at the junctions.
We used the following physical parameters for silicon at TL = 300K [11]: The eﬀective electron
mass m = 0.26me, where me is the electron mass, ǫ = 11.7, and vs = 1.03 · 105m/s. The low
ﬁeld mobility is given by the empirical formula

µ0(ND) = µmin +

∆µ
1 + (ND/Nref )0.72

,

µmin = 80cm2/Vs

, ∆µ = 1430cm2/Vs − µmin

,

Nref = 1.12 · 1017cm

−3

.

The temperature dependent mobilities and relaxation times follow from the low ﬁeld values
according to eqs. (15,16).

For boundary conditions we have taken charge neutral contacts in thermal equilibrium with

the ambient temperature at x = 0 and x = l = 0.3 µm, with a bias V across the device:

n1 = ND(0)

, nN = ND(l)

,

T1 = TN = TL , Φ1 = 0 , ΦN = V

.

Iinitial values were taken from a simple DDM equilibrium state simulation.

Stationary results were obtained by applying to the device in thermal equilibrium a bias
which increased at a rate of typically 1 Volt per picosecond from zero Volts to the desired ﬁnal
value. After 6 picoseconds, the stationary state was de facto reached, i.e. the current density
was then constant up to 10−4%.

In most cases we used N = 200 discretization cells, which proved to be accurate enough,
and time steps ∆t of the order of a femtosecond. A comparison with simulations with N > 500
shows that all relevant quantities do not diﬀer more than about 5% from the exact solution.
The computation of a stationary state on a typical modern workstation requires only few

seconds of CPU time, if FORTRAN 95 is used.

EBM. The symmetric curve is the nearly abrupt doping proﬁle.

Fig. 1 shows the electron density for the EB and HD charge transport models for a bias of
1 V. The choice of 1 V is meaningful since at higher bias (> 2 V), the HDM would no longer
be applicable or the device would even be destroyed.

In this paper, solid lines refer always to the HDM anddashdotted lines to the EBM. The
HDM exhibits more structure than the EBM. It is interesting to observe that the electron ﬂow
becomes supersonic at x = 0.109 µm in the HDM (whereas it remains subsonic in the DDM).
Fig. 2 shows also the soundspeed in the electron gas calculated from the electron temperature in
the HDM, which is given by c =

otherwise (dashed curve). In fact, a shock wave develops in the region where the Mach number
v/c is greater than one. In the DDM, the electron velocity exceeds the saturation at most by
30%. The maximum electron velocity in the HDM is 2.61 vs, in the EBM only 1.87 vs.

Finally we observe in Fig. 3 that the EBM is able to describe the electron temperature in
an acceptable way. It also predicts the cooling of the electron gas near x = 0.1 µm, which is
caused by the little energy barrier visible in Fig. 4, where the electric ﬁeld has a positive value.
The dotted line in Fig. 4 show the electric ﬁeld in thermal equilibrium.

But still it is interesting to note that the drift part of the mean electron energy ω/n becomes
large in a small region around the drain-source junction, where the electron kinetic energy can
be as large as 58% of the total energy (Fig. 5).

From the point of view of device modeling, the J-V-characteristics resulting from the three
models is of importance (Fig. 6). At low bias, the electron mobility is in all three models is
governed by the low ﬁeld mobility µ0.

But it is quite astonishing how the EBM predicts a J-V-curve which is in very good agreement

with the HDM prediction also in the range of higher biases, such that the two curves in Fig.
6 are nearly undistinguishable. As we have already mentioned, the EBM does not take inertia
eﬀects into account, which play no role for the stationary case. The predictive power of the
two models is quite diﬀerent, as we will see in the next section. But in the stationary case, the
diﬀerence in the J-V-characteristics is, roughly speaking, averaged out.

5. Inertia eﬀects

For GaAs, the relaxation times are quite high. Therefore, inertia eﬀects will become important
if the applied electric ﬁeld changes at a high frequency. We simulated therefore a GaAs ballistic
diode at 300 K. The diode begins with an 0.2 µm n+ source region with doping density
ND = 2 · 1017cm−3, is followed by an 0.4 µm n channel region (ND = 2 · 1015cm−3), and
ends with an 0.2 µm n+ drain region (ND = 2 · 1017cm−3). The relevant data like energy-
dependent relaxation times and electron mass were obtained by two-valley MC simulations,
where also the non-parabolicity of the two lowest conduction band valleys in GaAs was taken
into account. For the sake of brevity we will not go into details here, which will be given in a
forthcoming paper concerning the full hydrodynamic simulation of a GaAs MESFET structure.
In order to show the diﬀerent behavior of the HDM and EBM in time-domain, we applied to
the 0.1 V pre-biased ballistic diode an additional 0.1 V pulse of 1 picosecond duration (see Fig.
7). Fig. 8 shows the particle current density in the exact middle of the device for both models
as a function of time. Whereas the current in the EBM reacts immediately to the applied ﬁeld,
the current in the HDM shows relaxation eﬀects. The impulse relaxation time in the channel
of the diode is of the order of 0.3 picoseconds, the energy relaxation time lies between 0.3 and

1 picosecond. We emphasize the fact that considering the total current

does not help; the eﬀect remains. Therefore we must conclude that the EBM, which is often
termed ”hydrodynamic model” in commercial semiconductor device simulators, may lead
accidentally to reasonable (static) characteristics of a device, although the physical processes
inside the device are modelled incorrectly.

A simple discretization scheme for the hydrodynamic model is given in full detail which
gives a valuable tool to the practitioner entering the ﬁeld of hydrodynamic device modeling.
Comparisons of the diﬀerent transport models show that the energy-balance model is capable
of describing the behavior of submicron devices fairly well, but full hydrodynamic simulations
are needed in order to give a satisfactory description of the device from the physical point
of view. At high frequencies, inertia eﬀects become important in GaAs and related materials.
It is therefore clear that the EBM will be no longer adequate for simulation of high-speed
submicron devices in the near future.

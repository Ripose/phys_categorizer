Abstract

Local scaling and singularity properties of solar wind and geomagnetic
time series were analysed using H¨older exponents α. It was shown that in
analysed cases due to multifractality of ﬂuctuations α changes from point to
point. We argued there exists a peculiar interplay between regularity / irregu-
larity and amplitude characteristics of ﬂuctuations which could be exploited
for improvement of predictions of geomagnetic activity. To this end layered
backpropagation artiﬁcial neural network model with feedback connection
was used for the study of the solar wind - magnetosphere coupling and pre-
diction of geomagnetic Dst index. The solar wind input was taken from
principal component analysis of interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld, proton den-
sity and bulk velocity. Superior network performance was achieved in cases
when the information on local H¨older exponents was added to the input layer.

Introduction

One of the goals of solar-terrestrial physics is to predict the response of magneto-
sphere-ionosphere system to highly variable conditions in the solar wind (SW). The
question of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling (SWMC) can be studied by means
of input-output modelling. Linear input-output techniques (or linear prediction
ﬁltering) describe the SWMC by a linear moving-average (MA) ﬁlter assuming
that the convolution of a time-invariant transfer function (TF), with an earlier SW
input can predict the magnetospheric output represented by time series of geomag-
netic indices [Iyemori et al.(1979), Bargatze et al.(1985), McPherron et al.(1988)].
The TF characterizes the magnetospheric response and can be estimated directly
from data provided that a sufﬁciently large number of input-output pairs is avail-
able. In fact, [Bargatze et al.(1985)] using the vBz − AL input-output data (v -
solar wind velocity, Bz - interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld N − S component, AL -

1

auroral zone geomagnetic index) have shown that the linear MA ﬁlters can iden-
tify two different regimes in which SW energy is dissipated within the magne-
tosphere (directly driven and loading-unloading regimes). At the same time, the
best linear MA ﬁlters do not predict the geomagnetic output precisely, unless
strongly varying ﬁlter parameters are considered in each case of activity level sep-
arately [Blanchard and McPherron(1994)]. Different levels of geomagnetic activ-
ity and the nonlinearity of the SWMC were then treated by nonlinear MA ﬁlters
[Price et al.(1994), Vassiliadis et al.(1995)] using the assumption that the geomag-
netic activity is a nonlinear function of the solar wind input. Actually, local linear
(that is nonlinear) MA ﬁlters were used, which represent a linear approximation
of the nonlinear system. Nonlinear MA ﬁlters proved to be better predictors of
geomagnetic response as the linear ones, but the internal dynamics of the magneto-
sphere and the additional inﬂuence of it on the geomagnetic response itself (a feed-
back) was more explicitly considered within the frame of state-input space models
[Vassiliadis et al.(1995)]. Here the prediction of magnetospheric states is made
within a common input (solar wind) - output (geomagnetic data) phase space and
the local linear (nonlinear) approximation is given by an evolution of the nearest
neighbours of a phase space point. [Vassiliadis et al.(1995)] found that in compar-
ison with linear state-input models (global aproximation) the nonlinear state-input
models (local approximation based on nearest neighbours) give better predictions
of geomagnetic activity.

An alternative to the above MA ﬁlters is represented by artiﬁcial neural net-
works (ANN) which are global nonlinear functions. Elman recurrent ANN was
used by [Munsami (2000)] to model SW forcing of the westward auroral elec-
troject and the storm-time ring current. In predicting geomagnetic activity their
performance was similar to that of linear ﬁlters [Hernandez et al.(1993)]. Signiﬁ-
cantly better performance was achieved by gated ANNs that accounted for differ-
ent levels of activity. [Weigel et al.(1999)] used three individual ANNs for mod-
elling low, medium and high vBz, AL activity levels using data from database of
[Bargatze et al.(1985)]. The outputs of these ANNs together with past geomagnetic
outputs were used to train the gate network. It was shown by [Weigel et al.(1999)]
and [Weigel(2000)] that the gated architecture give signiﬁcantly better predictions
as the ungated one or the ARMA system reported by [Hernandez et al.(1993)].
Obviously, the gated ANN architecture resembles the state-input space model of
[Vassiliadis et al.(1995)] giving account for changing activity levels. Local linear
ﬁlters can be calculated in a neighbour of any point in state-input space, the gated
ANN, however, uses only three levels of activity.

In this paper we propose a method which allows to consider the changing level
of SW ﬂuctuations.
Instead of building a more structured gated ANN architec-
ture we use the extra information on local scaling characteristics of properly in-

2

troduced measure which can be estimated directly from a time series. Multifrac-
tals exhibit time-dependent scaling laws and hence allow a description of irregular
phenomena that are localized in time. Multifractal scaling characteristics of geo-
magnetic ﬂuctuations were studied by [Consolini et al.(1996)] and [V¨or¨os(2000)].
[Jankoviˇcov´a et al.(2001)] using multilayer feed-forward ANN have shown that the
information on multifractal characteristics of geomagnetic data put to the input en-
hanced the performance of their ANN in reconstructing AE-index time series from
geomagnetic observatory data. The inclusion of multifractality, however, some-
what ampliﬁed the noise component in this case. We expect that the inclusion of
the scaling characteristics of solar wind and geomagnetic ﬂuctuations to the ANN
modelling of SWMC offers a way for considering essential local information on
rapid changes, irregularities and intermittence not considered enough hitherto. In-
termittence of SW and geomagnetic ﬂuctuations was not built into nonlinear ﬁl-
ter or ANN models. Notwithstanding that SW ﬂuctuations proved to be strongly
intermittent [Burlaga(1991), Carbone(1994), Marsch et al.(1996), Tu et al.(1996),
Bruno et al.(1999)] and also both nonlinear magnetotail theories [Chang(1999),
Chapman et al.(1998), Klimas et al.(2000)] and experimental works [Consolini et al.(1996),
Borovsky et al.(1997), Consolini and De Michelis(1998), Consolini and Lui(1999),
V¨or¨os(2000), Kov´acs et al.(2001), Watkins et al.(2001)] predict or conﬁrm the pres-
ence of scalings, multifractality and intermittence within the magnetosphere. Though
there exist competing theoretical concepts regarding the underlying physical mech-
anisms which may or may not produce the observed scalings [Freeman et al.(2000),
Antoni et al.(2001)] these considerations have no effect on our analysis. We simply
ask what are the scaling characteristics of ﬂuctuations and how can this information
improve our ability to predict geomagnetic activity using ANNs.

2 Data analysis methods

2.1 Local scaling characteristics: the H¨older exponents

We consider the accumulated amount of signal energy within a window W : (ti −
W, ti). The signal energy E within a window W is computed as a sum of the
squared amplitudes of time series through

E(ti) =

X 2(ti);

i = 1, 2, . . . , N

i

X
i−W

and

(1)

(2)

N

X
i=1

X 2(ti) = 1

3

where X(ti) represents a time series, N is the total number of data points. The
distribution of E in time is considered to be a measure which may also appear as
singular. Mathematically, a measure can be characterized by its density. An erratic
behaviour appears in the absence of a density for a singular measure. Generally,
singular distributions can be characterized locally by the so-called singularity or
H¨older exponents α [Halsey et al.(1986), Muzy et al.(1994), V´ehel and Vojak(1998)].
Loosely speaking, the exponent α quantify the degree of regularity or irregularity
(singularity) in a distribution or a function in a point ti. Usually, the measure
E(ti, W ) within a window W scales as W α. Therefore, α can be estimated by a
regression method using

α(ti, W ) =

logE(ti, W )
logW

(3)

taking different window lengths W . For a monofractal α(ti) = const for all
ti, while in a case of multifractal measure (non-uniform distribution) α changes
from point to point (non-stationarity). For instance, fractional Brownian motion
or continuous Itˆo processes represent self-afﬁne ﬂuctuations governed by a single
H¨older exponent. The global distribution of singularity exponents α for geomag-
netic ﬂuctuations was studied by [Consolini et al.(1996)] and [V¨or¨os(2000)].
It
was shown that on the time scale of substorms and storms geomagnetic ﬂuctua-
tions seem to be analogous to the simple multiplicative p-model which describes
energy cascade processes in turbulent ﬂows. This model explains how a speciﬁc
energy ﬂux introduced on large scales to a ﬂow can lead to non-homogeneous, in-
termittent energy distributions on small scales. On this basis we expect that in case
of homogeneous energy transfer rate between scales with no intermittency effects,
the above deﬁned distribution will be stationary and α(ti) ∼ 1 for all ti. Other-
wise, α(ti) < 1 indicate irregularities, sharp variations around ti, while α(ti) > 1
is found in regions where events are more regular [Riedi and V´ehel(1997)].
In
case of multifractal processes α changes from point to point, which usually makes
difﬁcult the numerical estimation of α’s. A number of papers deals with this
question [Muzy et al.(1994), Jaffard and Meyer(1996), Mallat and Hwang(1992),
V´ehel and Vojak(1998)]. Though the H¨older exponents do not characterize the lo-
cal regularity properties of a signal completely [Guiheneuf et al.(1998)], we are
going to use the simple relation (3) to show that even a rough estimation of local
scaling characteristics of the signal may enhance the performance of ANNs. We
note that a running numerical estimate of α may ﬂuctuate sharply for other, from
multifractality different, nonstationary processes.

2.2 ANN description

A layered backpropagation ANN model [Rumelhart et al.(1986), Kr¨ose and Smagt(1996)]
with feedback connection from output layer to input layer was constructed. The
output-input layer connection makes the output history to be an ordinary input unit
in training process. The output of the model can be expressed in the form

y(t + ∆τ ) = F (

where y denotes the Dst time series; the two inputs equal I (1) ≡ P c1 and I (2) ≡
P c2; T the history; ∆τ the time resolution (∆τ = 1 h); uik, vjk the weights be-
tween input and hidden layers; wk the weights between hidden and output layers;
v0, w0 the biases of the layers; Q the number of hidden units; F and fk the non-
linear activation function. In our model fk are the hyperbolic tangent and F the
linear activation functions and Q = 6. The performance of the ANN model was
evaluated through root mean squared error (RM SE) and correlation coefﬁcient

3 Data analysis

In this paper we are going to predict the Dst index one hour in advance using
the layered backpropagation ANN model with feedback connection. Prior to that,
we show several examples which demonstrate that the H¨older exponents estimated
by Equation 3 provide local characteristics of the analysed time series sensitive
enough to capture the necessary information on the abrupt changes and activity
levels.

Figure 1a shows interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) variations registered by
the ACE satellite which is continuously monitoring the SW at the L1 Earth-Sun

5

Lagrange point. The time resolution is 16 s and 5 hours of data is shown from
January 14, 1998, 05:20 UT. This is a time period of very low activity level with
mean value of IMF ACE B ﬂuctuations of 3 nT. The H¨older exponents estimated
within variable window length W ∈ (16, 16 ∗ 160) s at each point are depicted in
Figure 1b. It is visible that α ﬂuctuates around its mean value ¯α ∼ 1, which means
that the measure is almost uniformly distributed. The energy content of the signal
E, and its scaling with window length, that is ∼ W α, is shown in a log-log plot in
Figure 1c.

In contrast with Figure 1, Figure 2 shows a more disturbed period of IMF ACE
B variations from March 31, 2001 from 00:00 to 05:00 UT. The mean value of
B is 43 nT. Large departures from ¯α = 1 are present (Figure 1b), mainly within
time periods of enhanced ﬂuctuations. These periods are characterized by sudden
increase of regularity (α > ¯α) followed by periods of low regularity (α < ¯α) or
vice-versa.

In fact, α appears to be a sensitive indicator of ﬂuctuations which may occur
during periods of enhanced IMF B amplitudes, however, when the ﬂuctuations
cease, the values of α return to ¯α ∼ 1, independently on the actual amplitudes. A
good example of it is visible within the time interval t ∈ (2600, 5000) s in Figures
2 a, b, where B > 50 nT and α ∼ 1. Moreover, the local ﬂuctuations of α around
¯α seem to be larger when the gradient of B increases, but it is not always valid (not
shown). There is also a clear difference between the scalings in Figure 1c and 2c.
We conclude that, besides the amplitude of magnetic ﬁeld variations, the local
scaling properties of signal described by H¨older exponents α (Equation 3) may
represent an essential piece of information the consideration of which would allow
a better prediction of future geomagnetic activity.

Other examples of longer period data sets (from March 19 to April 25, 2001)
are depicted in Figure 3. This time, IMF Bz from ACE satellite and the Dst in-
dex are considered with time resolution of 1 hour. The thick line in Figure 3a
corresponding to Bz = −10 nT highlights periods of enhanced SWMC.

[Gonzalez and Tsurutani(1987)] have shown that the interplanetary causes of
intense magnetic storms (Dst < −100 nT) are long duration (> 3 h) large and neg-
ative (< −10 nT) Bz events associated with interplanetary duskward electric ﬁelds
> 5[mV m−1]. Comparison of Figures 3a, d shows an agreement with the above
criteria, that is, long duration negative IMF Bz events occur together with intense
magnetic storms. Horizonthal thick line corresponds to the limit of Dst = −100
nT in Figure 3d. Figure 3b shows the normalized measure E and the estimated
H¨older exponents are in Figure 3c. Approximately the same behaviour is visible
as previously (Figure 2), which may be even better visualised by drawing 3D plots
of time, IMF Bz or Dst index and the corresponding H¨older exponents as in Fig-
ures 4a, b. In both cases when the above mentioned physical limits of amplitudes

6

(Bz < −10 nT and Dst < −100 nT) are crossed, the H¨older exponents have
their local minima, α < ¯α, indicating sharp irregular variations. Intense magnetic
storms (Dst ≤ −100 nT and α < ¯α) are usually preceeded by sudden increases of
α ≫ ¯α, that is, by short periods of increased regularity (Figure 4b). The same ef-
fect is present in Bz time series (Figure 4a), though, except the large event around
∼ 300 hours, it is less visible.

We expect that precisely the interplay between regularity / irregularity and
amplitude characteristics should be learnt by ANNs to achieve superior perfor-
mance. The simplest way to realize that is to add, besides the amplitudes of the
analysed variables, the corresponding series of H¨older exponents to the ANN in-
put. The following ACE SW parameters with ∆τ = 1 hour time resolution were
used: Bx, By, Bz, |B|, n, v. The time evolution of 1 hour Dst index from
January 1 to July 28, 2001 was considered. The time series of SW parameters
were preprocessed using principal component (P c) analysis [Gnanadesikan(1977),
Reyment and J¨oreskog(1996)]. The linear combinations of normalized SW param-
eters, their derivatives and combinations: Bx, By, Bz, |B|, n, v, nv, n|B|, v|B|,
vn|B|, dBx/dt, dBy/dt, dBz/dt, d|B|/dt, dv/dt, dn/dt were used for the calcu-
lation of the P c’s. It was shown by [Jankoviˇcov´a et al.(2002)], that for the consid-
ered set of SW parameters, most of the variance of SW ﬂuctuations is controlled
by the ﬁrst two components. In this paper we use P c1 and P c2 as SW input time
series.

The local scaling characteristics of the principal components are described in
the same way as of the other SW parameters. The time interval under study was
divided into two subsets. The ﬁrst one (part A in Figure 5) from January 1 to March
14, 2001 was used for ANN training while the second one (part B in Figure 5) from
March 15 to July 28, 2001 represented independent set for prediction, not included
in ANN training process. The inﬂuence of inclusion of local H¨older exponents on
ANN performance was tested for a set of values of history T and window length W ,
whilst T = W . In all cases analysed here a feedback consisting of past T values
of Dst index was set. Figure 6 shows the dependence of correlation coefﬁcient ρ
(Equation 6) in three different cases: 1.) H¨older exponents α are not considered
on input at all - only P c1, P c2 and the Dst feedback with history T (indicated
by a continuous line); 2.) H¨older exponents of P c1 and P c2 vectors are added as
input (marked by ”∗”); 3.) as in case 2.), but H¨older exponents describing the local
scaling properties of past Dst values are also added as an extra input (depicted
by ”o”). The effect of the inclusion of H¨older exponents is evident mainly in the
superior performance of ANNs in case 3. The correlation coeﬁcient ρ achieves its
maximum ρmax = 0.99 at W = T = 2 h and decreases with increasing T and
W . At the same time ANN performance is practically unchanged in cases 1 and
2 when T and W increase. We mention that without the Dst feedback ρ slowly

7

increases with T [Jankoviˇcov´a et al.(2002)]. As it can be seen, the consideration
of scaling properties of P c1 and P c2 SW data enhances a little the performance
level of ANN, but a real improvement is achieved when the singularity or regularity
properties of geomagnetic ﬂuctuations are taken into account, too (case 3). It seems
to conﬁrm our expectation that the information on local scaling properies of signals
put to the input layer allows to learn input-output relations better accounting for
changing activity levels more effectively. The analysis of RM SE (Equation 5)
leads to the same conclusion. For demonstration 1 hour ahead predictions of an
intense geomagnetic storm are shown in Figure 7a. Two methods are compared
(Figure 7b, c): case 1 as deﬁned above, when the Dst index is predicted without
H¨older exponents and case 3, with the information on α’s (P c1, P c2 and Dst)
added to the input layer (the cases 1 and 2 are similar). Easy to recognize that the
method using α’s (case 3) allows to predict almost all the variance in the data with
ρ = 0.99 and RM SE = 2 nT having T = W = 2 h. At the same time ρ = 0.93,
RM SE = 7 nT for T = W = 2 h (Figure 6 in case without H¨older exponents).
In comparison, [Wu and Lundstedt(1996)] have exploited Elman recurrent ANNs
to predict the Dst index 1 hour ahead only from SW data. They achieved ρ = 0.91
and RM SE = 16 nT.

4 Conclusions

We presented a prediction technique which uses the extra information on local
scaling exponents to improve the performance of a layered ANN with feedback.

It was demonstrated that the H¨older exponents α are time dependent and change
from point to point exhibiting large deviations from the mean value ¯α = 1, mainly
during enhanced activity levels of ﬂuctuations. A peculiar interplay between regu-
larity / irregularity features (described by α) and amplitude characteristics of dis-
turbances was found and demonstrated on examples of SW and geomagnetic data.
ANN performance was signiﬁcantly improved by putting the H¨older exponent time
series of corresponding SW and geomagnetic past data to the input layer yielding
the least RM SE error of 2 nT for short history T = 2 h and window length
W = 2 h. The results obtained without H¨older exponents were the worst (ρ ∼
0.93, RM SE ∼ 7 nT). Only a small improvement if any was achieved when the
H¨older exponents of SW P c1 and P c2 were added only (ρ ∼ 0.94, RM SE ∼ 6
nT). It means that to understand and model better the magnetospheric response, in
addition to SW input and geomagnetic history (feedback), the scaling and irreg-
ularity / regularity features of magnetospheric ﬂuctuations should also be taken
into account.
It is not an unexpected result, however, because recent nonlin-
ear theories on SWMC or magnetotail dynamics involve or predict the appear-

8

ance of scalings, irregularities (singularities) and turbulence [Galeev et al.(1986),
Chang(1999), Chapman et al.(1999), Klimas et al.(2000)]. To fully exploit this ap-
proach on experimental basis, further investigations of scalings and singularity fea-
tures of ﬂuctuations in different inner and outer regions of the magnetosphere will
be necessary.

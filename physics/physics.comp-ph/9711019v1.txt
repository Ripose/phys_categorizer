Abstract

A method to compute the bound state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
a Schr¨odinger equation or a spinless Salpeter equation with central interac-
tion is presented. This method is the generalization to the three-dimensional
case of the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method for one-dimensional Schr¨odinger
equation. It requires only the evaluation of the potential at equally spaced
grid points and yields the radial part of the eigenfunctions at the same grid
points. It can be easily extended to the case of coupled channel equations and
to the case of non-local interactions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Numerous techniques have been developed to ﬁnd the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
In particular, developments of the
the Schr¨odinger and the spinless Salpeter equations.
Hamiltonian in a convenient bases have been widely used (see for instance Refs. [1,2]).
The accuracy of the solutions depends on two parameters: The size of the basis and a
characteristic length which determines the range of the basis states. Upper bounds of the
true eigenvalues are computed by diagonalizing the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix. The
quality of the bounds increases with the size of the basis and, for a given number of basis
states, there exist a characteristic length which minimize the value of a particular upper
bound.

In the case of a Schr¨odinger equation, other methods requiring only the evaluation of the
potential at equally spaced grid points, yields directly the amplitude of the eigenfunctions at
the same grid points [3,4]. In particular, the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method [4,5] appears
very accurate and simple to handle. This method is variational [6] and relies on the fact
that the kinetic energy operator is best represented in momentum space, while the potential
energy is generally given in coordinate space.

In this paper, we show that this last method can be generalized to treat the semirelativis-
tic kinetic energy operator, simply by developing the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method in
the 3-dimensional space. Consequently, we propose to call our approach, the 3-dimensional
Fourier grid Hamiltonian method. We focus our attention on the case of purely central local
potential, but the method can also be applied if the potential is non-local, or if coupling
exist between diﬀerent channels. As explained below, the accuracy of the method depends
on the number of grid points and on the maximal radial distance considered to integrate the
eigenvalue equation. This last parameter is not easy to calculate without knowing a priori
the wave function, so we propose an Ansatz to determine it.

Our method is outlined in Sec. II, while Sec. III presents a convenient way to compute
the domain on which the wave functions are calculated. Test applications of the method are
described in Sec. IV, and a brief summary is given in Sec. V.

We assume that the Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of the kinetic energy ˆT and

a potential energy operator ˆV . The eigenvalue equation for a stationary state is given by

where ˆT depends only on the square of the relative momentum ~p between the particles, ˆV is
a local interaction which depends on the relative distance, and E is the eigenenergy of the
stationary state. This equation is a nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation if

In the following, we only consider the case of a local central potential

h~r | ˆV |~r ′i = V (r) δ(~r − ~r ′) with r = |~r |.

It is then useful to decompose the wave function into its central and orbital parts

h~r |Ψi = Rl(r) Ylm(ˆr) with ˆr = ~r/r.

To compute the non-local representation of the kinetic energy operator, we introduce the
basis states {|kλνi}, which are eigenstates of the operator ~p 2. They are characterized by
good orbital quantum numbers (λ, ν), obey the relation

and satisfy the orthogonality relation

The representation of these states in the conﬁguration space is given by

ˆT (~p 2)|kλνi = T (k2)|kλνi,

B. Discretization

ri = i∆ with i = 0, 1, . . . , N,

where ∆ is the uniform spacing between the grid points. Regularity at origin imposes
ul(r0 = 0) = 0. For bound states, we have limr→∞ ul(r) = 0. Consequently, we choose to
set ul(rN = N∆) = 0. Actually, this last condition is not necessary but it does not spoil the
accuracy of solutions. The normalization condition for the radial wave function is

This corresponds to an integration by trapezoidal rule thanks to the choice of a vanishing
radial wave function at r = r0 and r = rN .

The grid spacing ∆ in the conﬁguration space determines the grid spacing ∆k in the
momentum space. The maximum value of r considered being rN = N∆, the wave function
lives in a sphere of diameter 2rN in the conﬁguration space. This length determines the
longest wavelength λmax and therefore the smallest frequency ∆k which appears in the k-
space is

We have now a grid in conﬁguration space and a corresponding grid in momentum space

The (N − 1) eigenvalues en of Eq. (17) correspond approximately to the ﬁrst (N − 1) eigen-
values of Eq. (11). In the case of a potential which possesses a continuum spectra, only
eigenvalues below the dissociation energy are relevant. Other eigenvalues, which form a dis-
crete spectrum of positive energies, are spurious and correspond to standing wave solutions

III. DOMAIN OF INTEGRATION

The accuracy of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions depends on two parameters: The
value of N and the value of rN . Obviously, for a given value of rN , the accuracy increases
with N. A proper choice for the domain of integration is not evident. If rN is too small,
incorrect solutions will be found.
If this parameter is too large, a great number of grid
points will be necessary to obtain stable eigenvalues. In this section, we propose an Ansatz
to compute a suitable value of rN . The idea is to ﬁnd the radial distance rǫ for which the
radial part R(r) of the eigenfunction considered is such that

rǫR(rǫ)
max [rR(r)]

≤ ǫ,

where ǫ is a number small enough to neglect the contribution of R(r) for values of r greater
than rǫ. The eigenfunction considered being a priori unknown, we propose to use a trial
wave function matching at best the true eigenfunction, at least for the large r behavior. The
value of r satisfying the condition (26) for the trial wave function will be the value rN used
for the numerical computation.

The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a potential V∞(r) which matches at best the potential V (r) for

r → ∞. In the following, we will consider three diﬀerent types:

V∞(r) = κ rp with κ > 0

and p > 0,

V∞(r) = −

κ
rp with κ > 0

and 0 < p ≤ 1,

V∞(r) = −V0 θ(a − r) with V0 > 0

and a > 0.

The second step is to choose a trial state |λi which depends on one parameter λ, taken here
as the inverse of a distance. This trial state and the eigenstate considered are characterized
by similar behaviors for r → 0 and r → ∞. The best matching between this state and the
trial state is obtained by means of the variational principle. The average value

is then computed and the value of λ is determined by the usual condition

hλ| ˆH∞|λi = hλ| ˆT + V∞(r)|λi

∂hλ| ˆH∞|λi
∂λ

= 0.

In the case of the spinless Salpeter equation, the variational solution is computed using the
fundamental inequality

~p 2 + m2

≤

h~p 2i + m2.

(cid:28)q

(cid:29)

q
The radial part R(r) of the trial state is then analyzed to ﬁnd the value of r which satisﬁes
the condition (26).

We have remarked that with ǫ = 10−4 it is possible to reach a relative accuracy better
than 10−5 on eigenvalues, provided N is large enough (N >
∼ 50 − 100). A relative accuracy
on eigenvalues better than ǫ can be achieved because the mean value of an observable is
computed using the square of the function rR(r).

A. Ground states

We ﬁrst consider the case of ground states, that is to say states without vibrational
excitation. In the case of a potential with a large r behavior given by Eq. (27a), we use
harmonic oscillator wave functions as trial states. The radial part is given by

The corresponding relation for the case of a nonrelativistic kinematics is obtained with
vanishing value for the parameter λ in the right-hand side of the above formula. The
reduced mass of the system appears naturally and the equation is no longer a transcendental
equation.

If the potential, at great distances, is similar to the potentials given by Eqs. (27b)-(27c),
the trial states used are the bound state Coulomb wave functions. The radial part is written

Again, the corresponding relations for the case of a nonrelativistic kinematics is obtained
with vanishing value for the parameter λ under the square roots in the right-hand side of the
above formulas. The reduced mass of the system appears naturally, but Eq. (35) remains a
transcendental equation.

Once λ is found, it is easy to ﬁnd rN . Let us introduce a dimensionless variable xN = λrN .

B. Vibrational excited states

When the eigenstate considered is characterized by a vibrational excitation v diﬀerent
from 0, we can use, in principle, the (v + 1)th harmonic oscillator or Coulomb wave function
as a trial wave function. But such a procedure makes analytical calculation of the optimal λ
much more complicated. One knows that the polynomial multiplying the exponential term
in the (v + 1)th wave function has degree (v + l) in the Coulomb case and (2v + l) in the
harmonic oscillator case. So we can use a trial state with the value of l replaced by an
eﬀective orbital angular momentum leﬀ which take into account the highest degree of the
polynomial part of the radial trial state. We have veriﬁed that for potentials with large
distance behavior of type (27a), it is a good approximation to take leﬀ = 2v + l. In the
case of potentials with large distance behavior of types (27b) or (27c), it is better to use
leﬀ = v + l.

IV. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION

We have tested the accuracy of our method with diﬀerent models found in the literature
[1,2,7]. In particular, we have ﬁnd the same results as those of ref. [1], in which a Schr¨odinger
equation and a spinless Salpeter equation are used with a potential containing a Coulomb
part and a linear part. In this section, we only present the results for a Schr¨odinger equation
with a linear potential and for a spinless Salpeter equation with the Coulomb potential.

In the model of Ref. [7], the masses of some meson states are simply given by a non-

relativistic Hamiltonian with a conﬁnement linear potential

The regularized radial part un(r) of the nth zero orbital angular momentum eigenfunction
of this Hamiltonian can be written in terms of the Airy function [8]

H = m1 + m2 +

where xn is the nth zero of the airy function. In Fig. 1, we show the 8th S-wave eigenfunction
of Hamiltonian (37) for parameters values: m1 = m2 = 0.300 GeV, a = 0.1677 GeV2 and
C = −0.892 GeV, found in Ref. [7] (this corresponds to 7th excitation of the ρ-meson). On
this ﬁgure, the exact function is obtained with formula (38) and the numerical one has been
computed with a value of rN calculated with the procedure described in Sec. III for ǫ = 10−4
and with a number of grid points N = 30. In these conditions, the 8th eigenvalue is found
with a relative accuracy better than 10−4. This error can be reduced by a factor 10 or more
by increasing N. The numerical solution is indistinguishable from the analytical solution to
the resolution of the ﬁgure. If the wave function must be used to compute mean values of
observables, a greater number of points is obviously necessary.

None analytical solution of the spinless Salpeter equation with Coulomb potential is
known. But this equation has been extensively studied and it is possible to compare the

8

results of our method with results from other works. In Table I, we show some eigenvalues

with the parameter values: m1 = m2 = 1 GeV and κ = 0.456. The accuracy of our results
are similar of those of Refs. [1,2], even better for excited states found in Ref. [2] (the purpose
of the work in Ref. [2] was not to reach the greatest possible accuracy, but to demonstrate
the feasibility of a method). We have remarked that a greater number of grid points is
necessary for spinless Salpeter equation than for Schr¨odinger equation to reach a similar
accuracy.

V. SUMMARY

The 3-dimensional Fourier grid Hamiltonian method, formulated and tested in this paper,
appears as a convenient method to ﬁnd the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of a Schr¨odinger
or a spinless Salpeter equation. It has the advantage of simplicity over all the other tech-
niques. In particular, it requires only the evaluation of the potential at some grid points
and not the calculation of matrix elements in a given basis. The method generates directly
the values of the radial part of the wave function at grid points; they are not given as a
linear combination of basis functions. Moreover, the extension of the method to the cases
of non-local interaction or coupled channel equations is trivial.

It is worth noting that the method based on the expansion of the wave function in basis
functions can present some interesting features. In some cases, all the matrix elements can
be generated from analytic expressions. Further, the size of the matrices required can be
considerably smaller (about 20 × 20 or 40 × 40) [1].

The accuracy of the solutions of the 3-dimensional Fourier grid Hamiltonian method can
easily be controlled since it depends only on two parameters: The number of grid points and
the largest value of the radial distance considered to perform the calculation. A very good
estimation of this last parameter can be easily determined by using the procedure described
above, and the number of grid points can be automatically increased until a convergence is
reached for the eigenvalues. The reliability of the method is also ensured by its variational
character.

The method involves the use of matrices of order ((N − 1) × (N − 1)), where N is the
number of grid points. Generally, the most time consuming part of the method is the
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrices. This is not a problem for modern computers,
even for PC stations. Moreover, several powerful techniques for ﬁnding eigenvalues and/or
eigenvectors exist and can be used at the best convenience. A demonstration program is
available via anonymous FTP on umhsp02.umh.ac.be/pub/ftp pnt/.

FIG. 1. Comparison of exact (solid curve) and numerically computed (crosses surrounded by
circles) eigenfunctions for the 7th excitation of the ρ-meson for the quark-antiquark Hamiltonian
of Ref. [7]. Our computation is carried out with N = 30 and an integration domain determined by
the procedure given in Sec. III for ǫ = 10−4. See the text for further details.

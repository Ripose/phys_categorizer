INTRODUCTION

A carbon nanotube is obtained when the honeycomb graphene sheet is wrapped into a

seamless cylinder [1]. The electronic properties are sensitive on its geometrical structure.

Depending on the orientation of the hexagons with respect to the nanotube axis, they can

be classiﬁed to ’armchair’, ’zigzag’, and ’chiral’. The single wall nanotubes (SWNT), which

consist of a single graphite layer, have diameter around 1

2nm and they are proposed as

−

ideal components for the future nano devices.

Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy on individual SWNT has been used re-

cently to provide atomically resolved images and to allow the determination of the nanotube

electronic properties as a function of the wrapping vector and diameter [2].

The electronic properties of hybrid structures of carbon nanotubes have already been

analyzed theoretically within the Hubbard model (see in our previous work [3]). We pointed

out there that the ﬁnite length of nanotubes aﬀects the properties of the hybrid structure.

In this paper we calculate within the real and k-space tight binding method the electronic

properties of carbon nanotubes. We examine the eﬀect of the chirality on the electronic

properties. In addition we study termination of nanotubes i.e. the eﬀect of the curvature at

the cups of nanotube to the local density of states. We point out the diﬀerences between the

two approaches. The real space method has the advantage that it permits the treatment of

ﬁnite size samples.

In the following we describe the methods in Sec II. In Sec III we present the results using

the k-space and real space tight binding method. We discuss the eﬀect of chirality, and the

termination of the nanotubes. In the last section we present the conclusions.

II. METHOD

A. k-space tight binding method

Tight binding theory in k-space has been used to calculate the electronic properties of

nanotubes. The energy dispersion relation for nanotube is found from the two dimensional

dispersion relation for the π bands of graphite by eliminating one of the two components

of the wave vector k according to the periodic boundary conditions in the circumferential

2

direction [4]

Ch ˙k = 2πm,

where Ch = na1 + ma2 is the chiral vector, a1, a2 are the unit cell basis vectors of graphite,

and n, m are integers. For example the energy dispersion relation for armchair nanotube is

Ea

q (k) =

1

t
{
±

±

4 cos(qπ/n) cos(ka/2) + 4 cos2(ka/2)
}

1/2.

For zig-zag nanotubes the corresponding dispersion relation reads

Ez

q (k) =

1

t
{
±

±

4 cos(qπ/n) cos(√3ka/2) + 4 cos2(qπ/n)

1/2.

}

Using the one dimensional dispersion relations the density of states (DOS) is calculated

using the following formulas [5]

where the diagonal matrix element of the Green function G(l, l; z) in one dimension is

ρ(E) =

real space tight binding method

Within the second approach we describe the SWNT by exact diagonalizations of the

real space tight binding Hamiltonian in a honeycomb lattice[3, 6, 7, 8]. The corresponding

Hamiltonian is written as

H =

t

X<i,j>σ

c†
iσcjσ + µ

niσ,

Xiσ

where i, j are sites indices and the angle brackets indicate that the hopping is only to nearest
neighbors, niσ = c†

iσciσ is the electron number operator in site i, µ is the chemical potential.

Within tight binding method we solve the following eigenvalue problem

where

ˆξun(ri) = ǫnun(ri),

ˆξun(ri) =

un(ri + ˆδ) + µun(ri),

and we obtain the eigenvectors u(ri) and the eigenenergies ǫn self consistently. Then the

local density of states (LDOS) at the ith site is calculated by

where the factor 2 comes from the twofold spin degeneracy, f

is the derivative of the Fermi

function,

For numerical stability reasons and in order to present more realistic results we set the

temperature T to a non zero value.

SWNT is formed by rolling the honeycomb sheet into a cylinder and using the appropriate

boundary conditions to describe armchair and zigzag structures.

III. RESULTS

We present ﬁrst the well known results using the tight binding method in reciprocal space.

We note that this method is restricted to description of nanotubes of inﬁnite length. In Fig.

1 we show the DOS for several nanotube structures. In order to analyze the density of states

we have to take into account the dispersion relation of nanotubes. The dispersion relation

of nanotube consists of 2n curves for the valence and conduction bands respectively. For

armchair nanotube the valence and conduction bands cross at the Fermi level. Therefore the

armchair nanotube is metallic as indicated by the ﬁnite density of states at E = 0 in Fig.

1. We also observe singularities at the band edges which correspond to the extrema of E(k)

relations. For zig-zag nanotube (n, 0) when n is not multiply of 3 the dispersion relation

curves do not cross at the Fermi level. As a consequence the nanotube is semiconducting

with an energy gap at the Fermi energy as seen in Fig. 1 for the (5, 0) nanotube. An

exception occurs when n is a multiply of 3. For example in the (9, 0) nanotube which is

shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure, we note that although its geometry corresponds to a zig-

zag nanotube, it is actually metallic since analysis of the energy dispersion relation shows

that the valence and conduction bands cross each other at the Fermi level at the Γ point

(k = 0).

We present now the results for the real space tight binding method. Contrary to the

previous case which is restricted to inﬁnite length nanotubes, this approach permits the

4

description of structures that are of ﬁnite length. Since the modern nanodevices require

ﬁnite length components this approach is more advanced compared to the k space approach.

The LDOS close to the boundary for the two dimensional graphite lattice which is presented

in Fig. 2 shows strong deviation from the bulk value (see Fig. 3). It is well known that

the bulk graphite is zero gap semiconductor which is not the case for graphene nanosamples

close to the interface since there are curves with ﬁnite DOS at the Fermi level. We study

then the armchair (5, 5) nanotube seen in Fig. 4. The LDOS shown in Fig. 5 shows ﬁnite

states in the Fermi level which indicate that the SWNT is metallic. This agrees with the

previous k-space approach. However we ﬁnd that the LDOS is strongly modulated close to

the boundary (see sites A,B,C in Fig. 5) from the bulk D site. Even-more at speciﬁc sites e.g.

C the LDOS approaches zero which indicates insulating behavior. An other characteristic is

the presence of bands with one-dimensional Van-Hove singularities at the band edges. Due

to the ﬁnite temperature that we use the overall line shape is smooth.

We would like to describe other nanotubes like the zig-zag which is shown in Fig. 6. This

nanotube is expected to be semiconducting. We conﬁrm that for the bulk. However close

to the surface a peak appears at speciﬁc sites (see Fig. 7). This is opposite to the k-space

We also describe the chiral nanotube which is shown in Fig. 8. This nanotube is semi-

conducting since n

m is not a multiply of 3. The magnitude of the semiconducting gap

−

depends on the chiral vector and is diﬀerent than the other semiconducting structures that

we studied e.g. (5, 0). However close to the surface a peak appears at speciﬁc sites (see Fig.

method.

9).

We discuss the termination of nanotubes. We speciﬁcally show that a geometrical and

topological eﬀect like the introduction of pentagons in a hexagonal lattice aﬀects not only

the curvature of the nanotube but also its electronic properties. We show in Fig. 10 the ter-

mination of an armchair nanotube using a cup which consists of a hemisphere of a fullerene.

The cup contains six pentagons and an appropriate number of hexagons. The LDOS close

to the end of the nanotube is deviating from the metallic behavior as seen in Fig. 11. As we

can observe a peak is developing close to Fermi energy which corresponds to localized states

that are formed due to the deformation of the lattice by the introduction of the pentagons.

In order to investigate the eﬀect of the cup to the nanotube we study then the electronic

structure of the isolated nanocone. This is formed by placing six pentagons and appropriate

5

number of hexagons such as a cone structure is formed (see in Fig. 12). This cone nanos-

tructure closes exactly the (5, 5) nanotube and constitutes a half fullerene molecule. As is

seen the bound states still exist. However due to the drastic reduction of the number of

atoms the produced nanostructure has density of states which resembles that of a molecule

with discrete bound levels (see Fig. 13).

Using the same procedure is possible to terminate a zig-zag nanotube. We show in Fig. 14

the termination of a zig-zag nanotube using appropriate number of pentagons. The LDOS

close to the end of the nanotube is seen in Fig. 15. Here the peak which corresponds to the

localized states around the pentagons exists at the Fermi energy. In order to investigate the

eﬀect of the cup to the (5, 0) nanotube we study then the electronic structure of the isolated

nanocone. This is formed by placing six pentagons and appropriate number of hexagons

such as a cone structure is formed (see in Fig. 16). This cone nanostructure closes exactly

the (5, 0) nanotube. As is seen the bound states still exist. However due to the drastic

reduction of the number of atoms the produced nanostructure has density of states which

resembles that of a molecule with discrete bound levels (see Fig. 17).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the electronic properties of ﬁnite length SWNT with in the tight bind-

ing method self consistently. This method provides advantages compared to the k-space

method, namely that it permits the study of ﬁnite length nanotubes, which are expected to

become the building blocks of the future nanodevices. The results indicate that for ﬁnite

length nanotubes the LDOS is strongly modiﬁed close to the boundary layers of the nan-

otube. Moreover the local density of states changes considerably around the pentagons that

terminate a nanotube where additional bound states are formed.

We have to make a distinction between the topological defects which we have studied in

the present work and which do aﬀect the electronic and transport properties of nanotubes

and the mechanical deformations which result from bending twisting, and compressing the

nanotube. The later in the absence of topological defects have minor eﬀect to the electronic

properties.

When studying the electronic properties of nanotubes the sp2 hybridization of the atomic

orbitals which has been used here, produces realistic results provided that the diameter of the

6

nanotube is large enough. Concerning purely mechanical properties the sp3 hybridization

would produce more realistic results.

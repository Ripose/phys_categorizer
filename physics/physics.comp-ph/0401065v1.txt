Abstract

This paper discusses aspects of the second order hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equation associ-

ated with the ideal lossless string under tension and it’s relationship to two discrete models. These

models are ﬁnite diﬀerencing in the time domain and digital waveguide models. It is known from

the theory of partial diﬀerential operators that in general one has to expect the string to accumulate

displacement as response to impulsive excitations. Discrete models should be expected to display

comparable behavior. As a result it is shown that impulsive propagations can be interpreted as

the diﬀerence of step functions and hence how the impulsive response can be seen as one case of

the general integrating behavior of the string. Impulsive propagations come about in situations of

time-symmetry whereas step-function occur as a result of time-asymmetry. The diﬀerence between

the physical stability of the wave equation, which allows for unbounded growth in displacement,

and computational stability, that requires bounded growth, is derived.

INTRODUCTION

Our purpose here is to discuss aspects of the relationship of the solution of the one-

dimensional second order wave equation to two discrete models thereof. The ﬁrst discrete

model is the digital waveguide model in one spatial dimension. The second discrete model

is a ﬁnite diﬀerence model in the time domain. In particular we will also discuss how this

relationship explains diﬀerent behavior between the discrete models. This relationship has

drawn much attention recently[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

It is shown that the ﬁnite diﬀerence model can account for solutions of the wave equation

and that these solutions are physically meaningful.

This allows for a direct interpretation of recent results by Karjalainen and Erkut [7] from

the fundamental solution of the wave equation. Karjalainen and Erkut gave the restrict-

ing conditions necessary to make ﬁnite diﬀerence models in the time domain and digital

waveguide models connect.

Regarding the stability behavior of the discrete models, the continuous stability is dis-

cussed and it is shown that physically stable responses of the string may appear unstable in

a discrete model or signal-processing sense.

The paper is structured as follows. First known derivations of the solution of the wave

equation is given, both classically and via the theory of fundamental solutions of its partial

diﬀerential operators. A discrete comparison of the ﬁnite diﬀerence [10] and the digital

waveguide model[29] follows. Smith’s text[9] provides the authoritative summary in of digital

waveguides with respect to the continuous derivations given earlier. We conclude with

implications of these observations.

II. SOLUTION OF THE WAVE EQUATION IN ONE DIMENSIONS

The results in this section are well-known. They are repeated here to facilitate arguments

in the following sections. Of concern is the general digital simulation of a string under force.

The free ideal string is well-described by the the 1 + 1 dimensional d’Alembertian operator

on a scalar ﬁeld[30]:

(cid:3)y(x, t)

def

= (

∂2

∂x2 − c2 ∂2

∂t2 )y(x, t)

(1)

2

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

An external force leads to the inhomogeneous case of the same equation:

(cid:3)y(x, t) = f (x, t)

Without loss of generality we assume that c = 1 for our discussion and hence one gets

the factored form of the d’Alembertian:

(cid:3) =

∂2
∂x2 −

∂2
∂t2 =

∂x

(cid:18)

+

∂
∂t (cid:19) (cid:18)

∂
∂x

−

∂
∂t (cid:19)

The factored form suggests the substitution ξ = x − t and η = x + t we obtain the

canonical form of the wave equation:

∂2u
∂ξ∂η

=

f

ξ + η
2

,

(cid:18)

η − ξ

2 (cid:19)

= φ(ξ, η)

This can be directly integrated, yielding [11]

u =

η

ξ

Z

η0 Z

ξ0

φ(u, w) du dw + h1(ξ) + h2(η)

where h1, and h2 are “constants of integration”. However, this notation hides that either

one of these constants has been integrated over with regards to its parameter. Also these

are not uniquely deﬁned functions from a yet undeﬁned functional space but rather any

function from suitable family of functions [11]. The derivation procedure suggests that h1(·)

and h2(·) are one and twice diﬀerentiable everywhere in the solution space, but which one

is twice diﬀerentiable depends in what order the solution has been integrated over.

The solution of the homogeneous case (1) with initial conditions y(x, 0) = f (x) and

yt(x, 0) = g(x) is well known [12, 13] to correspond to d’Alembert’s solution[31]:

y(x, t) =

(f (x + ct) + f (x − ct)) +

g(s) ds

(6)

Hence initial displacements travel left and right. Initial velocity, however smears over a

widening domain of inﬂuence.

Alternatively this results can be derived using the theory of partial diﬀerential opera-
tors. Writing L = (cid:3) and X = (x, t) one arrives at the generic partial diﬀerential operator

equation:

Lu(X) = k(X)

(7)

Here it is important to note that it is no longer required that u(·) is in the class of twice

diﬀerentiable functions C2, but rather that u(·) and k(·) are distributions[32] or generalized

functions. What this means in detail we will have to defer to expositions available elsewhere

[14, 15, 16]. For our purpose it is interest to note that in the theory of distributions jumps

and discontinuity are gracefully and meaningfully included in the formalism including the

deﬁnition derivatives of entities like the Dirac-delta δ(·) over the space of suitable functions

testing for this property. In addition it makes continuous convolutions a central operation to

the calculation of continuous solution, which make it’s treatment very similar to the study

of discrete models [17] which is regularly used for digital waveguide models[9].

In our treatment here we will closely follow Hulshof’s[15] and Joshi and Wassermann’s

lecture notes[18] and also Edwards’ text[14] which are more accessible than, for example the

technical survey by Egorov, Komech and Shubin[16]. The interested reader is pointed to

the latter for statements of necessary theorems as well as proofs or detailed references to

original proofs.

The fundamental solution of the equation (7) the eﬀect of the operator L on the distri-

bution u when it sees as input a Dirac-delta (as noted earlier this is not a function, but a

distribution). In the digital signal processing literature[17] u is called the impulse response

of L. In a dynamical sense it is the response to the inhomogeneous equation where the exter-

nal force distribution is a Dirac-delta δ. Of immediate interest are solution forward in time

the discussion is restricted to fundamental solutions in the positive half-plane with respect

to time. This will be indicated by the superscript + to the symbol E for the fundamental

solution:

LE +(X) = δ(X)

(8)

It can be proved that the solution of both the homogeneous equation with initial value

4

data and the inhomogeneous equation with some external force distribution can be recov-

ered from the fundamental solution [16]. This is done, in analogy to the impulse response

convolution in digital signal processing [17] by convolution of the fundamental solution with

the force distribution and the initial value data u(x, 0) = f (·) and ut(x, 0) = g(·). In the

literature these are call Cauchy data.

The fundamental solution[14, 15] of the one-dimensional wave equation can be derived

to be:

E +(x, t) =

H(t) [H(x + t) − H(x − t)]

(9)

1
2

Here H(·) is the Heaviside distribution, which is the distributional integral of the Dirac-

delta distribution δ(·). In conventional functional form the Heaviside step-“function” can

be written as[19]:

0 x < 0,

H(x) =

1
2 x = 0,

1 x > 0.





(10)

The interpretation of this equation is indeed important because it indicates, that the

“system response” of a wave operator to an input impulse are not isolated traveling wave

pulses but traveling step-distributions.

It may be convenient to think of the fundamental solution as the “distributional continu-

ous impulse response”. This makes sense because the solution of equation can be recovered

by convolution of the fundamental solution with the Cauchy data. The continuous convolu-

tion has the familiar form [15, 16]:

u(x) = (E + ∗ f )(x)

def

=

E +(x − s)f (s) ds

(11)

where f (x) is Cauchy data in one variable.

If both data and the fundamental solution are in two dimensions (as is possibly the case

for external force distributions), one need to convolve over both variables.

Speciﬁcally it can be shown (see [15, 16]) that for the set of Cauchy data u(x, 0) = f (x),

ut(x, 0) = g(x) and Lu(x, t) = k(x, t) one gets the complete solution:

u(x, t) = uf (x, t) + ug(x, t) + uk(x, t)

(12)

with the convolutions:

Performing the convolutions yields the the solution which is equivalent to the conventional

inhomogeneous initial value solution of the wave equation [15]:

For proofs of uniqueness see Egorov, Komech and Shubin[16]. In the absence of external

forces this reduces to the initial value solution (6).

The theory of generalized functions for partial diﬀerential operators explains why equa-

tions (5), derived for the forced case, and (6), derived for the homogeneous initial value case

have similar structure. The inhomogeneous case can in a generalized sense be made to in-

clude the homogeneous initial value problem (also called Cauchy problem). For example, if
we symbolically write ˜k(x, t) = δ(t)k(x, t) one sees that the external force response matches

the response to the initial velocity.

uf (x, t) = E +

t (·, t) ∗ f (x)

ug(x, t) = E +(·, t) ∗ g(x)

uk(x, t) = E + ∗ k(x, t)

y(x, t) =

(f (x + t, 0) + f (x − t, 0))

Hence an external force distribution which is impulsive in time ˜k(x, ·) is indistinguishable

from the equivalent initial velocity distribution g(x). Conversely it is noteworthy that initial

values do not prescribe a state of the string alone, but also prescribe a sudden onset of such

state. Hence initial values are not necessarily a free-ﬁeld solution of the wave equation, that

is the state of a string in the absence of force. Rather impulsive onset states act like external

In particular one can write the solution of the wave equation for the inhomogeneous initial

value problem in the following simple form [18]:

u(x, t) = E + ∗ g(x) + E +

Next we note the diﬀerentiation of distributions on step-functions (see also the Appendix

forces.

A):

hH ′, φi = hδ, φi

(20)

observe, using this relationship, that the derivative of the fundamental solution (9) are

two propagating Dirac-deltas, here again in symbolic notation:

E +
t =

1
2

H(t) (δ(x + t) + δ(x − t))

(21)

For the current discussion it remains only to point out that the ﬁrst contribution of (19)

look like propagating impulses under diﬀerentiation.

From (19) we see that the solution of the wave equation will only stay on the characteristic

lines ξ and η for a restricted class solutions of the wave equation. Only for very exceptional

cases of initial velocities g and external forces k will the solution not integrate into the

domain. Rather generically one ought to expect them to integrate into the inside of the

forward characteristic cone x ± t ≥ 0 as depicted in Figure 1.

The condition in which integration into the interior of the characteristic cone does not

occur will be discussed in the discrete case and in this context has been discovered by

Karjalainen and Erkut [7]. For this to be appropriate, care needs to be taken when assuming

the impulse response of the system to have a particular form, otherwise one ought to expect

7

both contributions at the same time. Additionally, in a physically realistic situation, when

it cannot be guaranteed that an excitation is of purely displacement-type, one ought to

expect that the dynamics of the system to integrate and persist over the whole inside of

the characteristic cone. It also is worthwhile to point out that this is the mathematically

consistent solution of the wave equation [16]. Hence, assuming that the wave equation is

a reasonable model for a given physical situation, one ought to expect such a behavior to

exist and be observable.

As a note, we state, that it is in fact well known that the Huygens’ Principle, the isolated

propagation of wave fronts, only holds for d’Alembertians of odd spatial dimensions greater

or equal to 3 [11, 16] meaning that only in this case does the fundamental solution concentrate

on the characteristic cone t2 = |x|2. Other cases, including one spatial dimension[33], have a

wave inﬂuence inside the characteristic cone. The idea that the solution would concentrate

on the characteristic cone for all dimensions was held for a long time by mathematicians

working on the wave-equation until Hadamard opened the development and the situation is

since well understood [20].

Regarding Huygens’ principle, a short popular exposition can be found in [21] whereas a

comprehensive technical exposition can be found in [22].

III. COMPARISON OF LEAPFROG AND WAVEGUIDE SOLVERS

Next the leapfrog ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme [10] will be compared with the digital waveguide

method [9]. The full treatment of derivations will not be repeated here and the reader is

referred to these sources for details.

Now let us discuss the properties of the so-called leap-frog ﬁnite diﬀerence molecule for

the wave equation. The explicit time-stepping equation reads [9, 10]:

y(n + 1, m) =y(n, m − 1) + y(n, m + 1)

− y(n − 1, m)

(22)

where the relationship between the discrete time step T and the spatial discretization X is

chosen to satisfy c = X/T . In this case the leapfrog molecule can be shown to be consistent at

sampling points with the wave equation [10]. It can also be shown that waveguide solutions

are solutions of the leapfrog [9]. As Karjalainen observes, the converse does not hold [6].

8

For future discussion we will use the following symbols:

The condition that an impulse at the root of the molecule will only create responses along

the characteristics of the wave can be expressed by the condition y+ = 0, i.e. there is no

data within the characteristic domain of the molecule.

Hence the non-integrating molecule condition reads:

From this we get the relationship of waves on the characteristics to their sum:

y+ = y(n + 1, m)

y> = y(n, m + 1)

y< = y(n, m − 1)

y− = y(n − 1, m)

y< + y> − y− = 0

y< + y> = y−

The updating rules for waveguides[34] are:

with the external force rule:

The wave reconstruction rule is:

yl(n, m) = yl(n − 1, m + 1)

yr(n, m) = yr(n − 1, m − 1)

yl(n, m) =

f (n, m)

yr(n, m) =

f (n, m)

y(n, m) = yl(n, m) + yr(n, m)

in response to an external force function f (n, m). If we take an impulse of height y− at

time n − 1 we get:

yl(n, m − 1) = yl(n − 1, m) = f (n − 1, m) =

yr(n, m + 1) = yr(n − 1, m) = f (n − 1, m) =

The reconstructed wave using (33) is zero everywhere except at:

y(n, m − 1) = yl(n, m − 1) =

y(n, m + 1) = yr(n, m + 1) =

1
2
1
2

y−

y−

y(n, m) = yl(n − 1, n) + yr(n − 1, m) = y−

and we see that the non-integrating case of the leapfrog (28) is satisﬁed with y< = 1/2y−

and y> = 1/2y−.

The leapfrog will “integrate” whenever condition (28) is not satisﬁed. To study the

behavior within the characteristic domain it is ﬁrst assumed that the elements on the char-

acteristic of the molecule y< and y> are unaltered. That is, the same waves as before travel

outward in the molecule. This leaves us to study an altered relationship between y+ and y−.

Let y− be the diﬀerence of y0

−, the molecule value for the non-integrating case (28), and

˜y−, an assumed contribution to the interior of the characteristic domain. Then we get:

y+ = y< + y> − (y0

− + ˜y−)

0 = y< + y> − y0
−

Subtracting (40) from (39) we get:

Hence the response at at the interior point of the characteristic domain is constant with

regards to the contribution of the incoming wave that violates the non-integration condition

(28).

y+ = ˜y−

and compare it to an excitation which observes (28). y< = y> = 1 and y− = 2:

Observe that (43) appears to be the sum of traveling histories and they are time-

symmetric around the intersection point. A time-symmetric solution is an equal contribution

to the solution traveling forward and backward in time and their sum yielding the complete

solution.

D’Alembert’s solution (6) can be used to investigate this observation when writing it in

the form following Alpert, Greengard and Hagstrom[23]:

y(x, t) + y(x, −t) =

(f (x + ct) + f (x − ct))

Taking the time-symmetric sum we get:

y(x, t) + y(x, −t) =f (x + ct) + f (x − ct)

(45)

11

Similarly, by taking the diﬀerence, one ﬁnds the time-asymmetric case:

y(x, t) − y(x, −t) =

g(s) ds

(46)

In the discrete case it is easy to see this property preserved in the leapfrog case:

(47)

(48)

(49)

While (48) nicely illustrates the time-symmetry and the “interference” of waves at the

interaction point, (47) is insightful as it clearly shows the properties of a velocity excitation.

The displacement vanishes at the interaction moment, while the temporal slope is maximal.

It should be made clear, that vanishing of data at one time-step in the leap-frog simulation

does not imply velocity solutions. This can be seen if a positive and a negative impulsive

wave cross, creating a time-symmetric situation that will not integrate inside the domain:

We observe that this situation does satisfy the time-symmetric equation (45).

Alternatively similar results can be derived by discretizing the initial velocity g(x) directly

using a matching center diﬀerence scheme [12]:

and including an arbitrary background ﬁeld one gets:

y+ − y− = g

y+ =

(f < + f >) + g

1
2

(50)

(51)

where we use the notation f + and f − to denote initial displacement wave contributions

aligned with the left-right branch of the leapfrog-molecule. Observe that (51) does satisfy

the same integration (41) and non-integration (28) conditions. Hence a velocity contribution

g can be interpreted as any violation of the rule of the sum of incoming traveling waves.

This behavior has been observed earlier. Karjalainen observed that an asymmetric pair

of impulses need to be fed into a leapfrog motivated junction formulations to avoid in-

tegration behavior [24]. The subsequent physical interpretation is derived in [7] from a

center-diﬀerence time-discrete velocity excitation. An interpretation of this result follows

next.

[7].

IV. SINGULAR PROPAGATION FROM INTEGRATION

The non-integrating condition can be algorithmically enforced by a method discovered

by Karjalainen and Erkut [6, 7]. Hence we will call this the Karjalainen-Erkut condition.

The rule is to present the excitation through a feed-forward ﬁlter [6]:

H(z) = 1 − z−2

(52)

which can be derived from physical conditions by using a center diﬀerence velocity term

We observe that the Karjalainen-Erkut condition (52) creates two impulses from one and

those impulses are center symmetric and sign-inverted. If we calculate those two impulse

responses separately and then create the sum, we see that the impulsive propagating solution

13

comes about as the diﬀerence of two Heaviside distributions. The pulses are represented by

their sign only as the amplitudes are assumed to be matched:

14

Hence we see that in an impulse-response interpretation of the leap-frog, a Heaviside

integration over the characteristic cone of inﬂuence is sensible and the Karjalainen-Erkut

condition ensures that each Heaviside integration is matched with a delayed sign-inverted

response that cancels all interior integration of the ﬁrst impulse to leave unaltered the

traveling impulse solution.

V. EFFECTS OF THE BOUNDARY

Next the eﬀect of imposing spatial boundary conditions is studied. For this it is assumed

that the solution of the wave equation is only meaningful and deﬁned for a compact domain

Ω. The length of the domain is denoted by L = |Ω|. For the boundary of the domain we

write ∂Ω and the interior of the domain is deﬁned by the quotient Ω \ ∂Ω. On each distinct

point of the boundary ∂Ω we impose one boundary condition. Fixed ends u(∂Ω) = 0 we call

Dirichlet boundary conditions, whereas open ends ut(∂Ω) = 0 we call Neumann boundary

conditions. Note that a circular domain u(|Ω|) = u(0) is a periodic unbounded domain.

The behavior at the boundary can be conveniently studied by extension of the domain. If

the boundary is of Dirichlet type, the value of u needs to vanish at the boundary and hence

the extension needs to be odd. In the case of Neumann conditions u needs to be even. As the

resulting inﬁnite extension is periodic in 2L this extension can be interpreted as a periodic

unbounded domain of this length [13]. We will denote the original domain by subscript 0
and extended domains by indicies n ∈ Z \ 0. The periodicity implies Ωm + 2 = Ωm for all
m ∈ Z.

The following discussion will be restricted to the behavior in response to the velocity term

g in (6). Observe that with periodicity we can write the integral as the sum of contributions

of the periodic domains:

η=x+t

Z

ξ=x−t

g(s) ds =

g(s) ds

Xm ZΩm≥ξ,η

Hence we integrate over all contributions above the characteristic lines from an excitation

point of the periodic domain.

With Dirichlet conditions one gets the odd extension [25]:

g(x) = −g(2m|Ω| − x)

and for Neumann conditions we get the even extension:

with x ∈ Ω0 and m ∈ Z \ 0.

Dirichlet boundary conditions:

Integrating up to the point where the characteristic lines have reached 2|Ω| one gets for

g(x) = g(2m|Ω| − x)

(57)

(58)

u(Ω) =

(59)

Hence integral contributions cancel every 2|Ω| and the maximum amplitude is bounded

by the integral of g(·) over the original domain Ω0.

The same procedure for Neumann boundary conditions leads to:

u(Ω) =

g(−s) ds

(60)

Figure 3 shows the behavior for a string tied at the ends (Dirichlet conditions) after an

initial impulsive distribution. It reveals many properties of the eﬀect of the boundary on

the integration of velocities under Dirichlet boundary conditions. It shows the odd-periodic
extension of the domain Ω0 to Ωn, n ∈ Z, it also shows the cancellation and constructive

interference eﬀect of overlapping integration regions. It also shows the 2|Ω| cancellation of

waves. Erkut and Karjalainen[26] (compare their Figure 7) reported numerical simulations

using the leapfrog molecule with comparable results, which hence matches the situation of

the continuous model.

A. Linear Growth of Displacement

Observe that the Neumann condition leads to a linear increase in the displacement as a

response to velocity or force data being present.

The diﬀerence between the Dirichlet condition and the Neumann condition can be inter-

preted as the diﬀerence between an alternating sum and an accumulative sum.

In the Dirichlet case the sign of the area integrated over alternates with periodicity |Ω|

and hence any ﬁnite bounded signal g(·) will produce an alternating sum which is bounded

similarly but inﬁnitely periodic.

In the Neumann the signs match and hence the area integrated over increases with every

iteration over the domain by the integral over the ﬁnite bounded signal g(·). Once the

support of g(·) has been exhausted, this obviously corresponds to a linear increase.

16

This is however, not an unphysical situation. This corresponds to constant kinetic energy

being present in the string and hence implies that the energy is bound. This can easily be

understood as linear increasing displacement implies constant velocity, which in turn implies

constant energy. Hence energy is conserved[13]. It can be interpreted as a string moving at

constant velocity, which is meaningful as the Neumann conditions imply that the string is

not tied down at the boundaries. Hence linear buildup in a displacement-like wave variable

is energy-conserving[35].

be represented.

Numerically this is still an undesirable situation because even in the absence of numerical

imprecision, the dynamic range of numbers are bounded and hence an inﬁnite increase cannot

The case of Neumann boundary conditions is interesting because it highlights the diﬀer-

ence between notions of stability as customary in discrete signal literature[17] and stability in

physical situations. The Neumann displacement response to any bounded input will be un-

bounded and hence is evidently not bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable, see Op-

penheim and Schafer[17], p. 20. We suggest that this BIBO-unstable but energy-conserving

system be called physically stable. The BIBO-instability is a discrete computational problem

and not one of the physical situation[36].

IMPLICATIONS

This paper discussed the linear lossless wave equation and its relationship to discrete

models, namely a ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme called leapfrog, and the digital waveguide method.

It is shown that the waveguide model corresponds to the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme in the

absence of integration. In the continuous case, integration can be expected to occur when

initial velocities or external forces are present. In this light the observed integrating behavior

of ﬁnite diﬀerence discretization in the time domain using the leapfrog molecule displays

results consistent with the continuous model. Here we assume that the wave equation is

at least in principle physically meaningful for the modeled situation. If this is the case one

should expect consistent behavior of the related discrete models.

In relation to this argument, a use of waveguide discretization that does not include

contributions inside the characteristic cone, does not include the integrating behavior of

the model equation. In general both integrating and non-integrating responses are to be

17

expected and hence should be present unless they can be explicitly excluded for physical

reasons.

This also implies that the impulse response in just one variable in general will not carry the

full dynamics of the string. Hence any assumption of the non-integrating impulse response

in one variable in the construction of physical models might contain deviations for it only

covers a reduced set of the solution space.

APPENDIX A: PROPERTIES OF DISTRIBUTIONS

Let f be a distribution on a real open interval Ω and let φ be in the the set of test

functions D(Ω) then one has [14]:

hφ, f ′i =

f φ′ dµ = −hφ′, f i

ZΩ

and for arbitrary derivatives:

hφ, ∂pf i = (−1)|p|h∂pφ, f i

the Dirac delta δ has the property:

(A1)

(A2)

(A3)

hence returns the value of φ at 0. By the diﬀerentiation rule the higher order derivatives

of the Dirac delta returns the higher order derivatives at 0 with alternating sign:

hφ, δi = φ(0)

18

hφ, ∂pδi = −(1)|p|∂pφ(0)

(A4)

Let H be the Heaviside distribution. It is deﬁned as [15]:

hφ, Hi =

H(s)φ(s)ds =

φ(s) ds

(A5)

It hence permits the positive part of φ over the domain. The derivative of the Heaviside

distribution H yields (using (A1) and (A4)) the Dirac-delta:

hφ, H ′i = −hφ′, Hi = φ(0) = hφ, δi

(A6)

APPENDIX B: THE WAVE EQUATION AND FIRST ORDER SYSTEMS

In order to derive the relationship between the wave equation to ﬁrst order systems, we

discuss two forms of such systems, namely, two transport equations in one variable and two

transport equations in a mixed pair of variables.

A generic version of a system of inhomogeneous ﬁrst order hyperbolic equations reads:

a

c

∂y
∂x
∂y
∂x

∂y
∂t
∂y
∂t

+ b

= h1(x) + h2(t)

+ d

= h3(x) + h4(t)

For simplicity assume that the force terms are separated in the independent dimensions.

Then a second order version is usually derived taking the derivative of one equation with

respect to t and the other one with respect to x. The cross-term yxt can be eliminated and

one gets two equations:

(B1)

(B2)

(B3)

(B4)

h1(x) −

h4(t)

∂t

19

The key observation is that one second order equation (B3) or (B4) is not strictly equal

to the system of ﬁrst order equations (B1) and (B2). It is only equal up to two functions

(whichever got eliminated, h1, h4 or h2, h3). They are equivalent up to two ”constants of

integration”.

For systems of ﬁrst order linear equations in two independent variables a related proof

holds. An intuitive interpretation is that in fact for ﬁrst order equations of the type:

one sees that the reduction to second order equations in u by diﬀerentiating (B5) with

respect to x and (B6) with respect to t one gets:

ux + wt = g1(t)

wx + ut = g2(x)

uxx − utt = 0

−wxx + wtt = ˙g1(t) − g′

2(x)

(B5)

(B6)

(B7)

(B8)

Note that diﬀerentiation eliminated g1 and g2 in one case and hence the homogeneous wave

equation is again indistinguishable for both the homogeneous and a class of inhomogeneous

systems of ﬁrst order equations and in this sense they are equivalent only up to two functions.

[29] For a friendly introductory exposition see Cook[27].

[30] We limit our discussion to this particular form. A note regarding the relationship of this

equation to pairs of ﬁrst order equations can be found in Appendix B.

[31] It is noteworthy to mention that the nomenclature for “d’Alembert’s solution” is not univer-

sally agreed upon. Some sources use it to describe the the general form of the integration of

the homogeneous equation in the absence of initial value or force (also called Cauchy) data

(like [12]) whereas in other sources, for example[16], it refers to the solution including Cauchy

(initial, boundary, external force) data. We will use it to denote the solution of the initial

value problem.

[32] Laurent Schwartz, the originator of the theory of distributions recently wrote an autobiography

[28] that includes a readable account of the historical development of his discovery. We quote

two statements from his book that are of interest relating to this article. He writes, when

describing the prehistory of his discovery [28, p. 212]: “One of the most important precursors

of distributions was the electrical engineer Heaviside.” In a section headed Vibrating strings,

harmonic functions he writes [28, p. 218]: “We had learned that the general solution of this

equation is of the form u(t, x) = f (x + vt) + g(x − vt), where f and g are arbitrary functions of

one variable. Naturally, this presupposes that f and g are C 2, so as to be able to diﬀerentiate

them. What should one think of a function u which would be analogous except that f and g

would be merely C 1 (continuous), or not even continuous? Is it a wave or not? I was obsessed

by this question for some time, then I stopped thinking about it and relegated the question

to a corner of my mind for future reﬂection.”

[33] The case of two spatial dimensions is relevant, but is not in the main thrust of this papers

discussion. An illustration of the one and two-dimensional wake of the wave-equation can be

found in Graﬀ[25], p. 220, Fig 4.4.

23

[34] Strictly speaking digital waveguide synthesis can be formulated in various ways. We will not

use any arguments from transmission-line theory here. For treatment of those aspects we refer

to [9].

[35] Evidently this argument is valid for any amplitude, also small amplitude oscillations, for which

the wave-equation is valid, as constant displacement does not alter curvature.

[36] Note that the velocity response is in fact BIBO-stable and hence treatment of the problem in

a velocity variable will not suﬀer this problem.

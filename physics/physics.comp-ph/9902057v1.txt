Abstract

A new algorithm for determining the eigenstates of n–dimensional billiards
is presented. It is based on the application of the Cauchy theorem for the
determination of the null space of the boundary overlap matrix. The method is
free from the limitations associated with the shape of the billiard and could be
applied even for nonconvex geometries where other algorithms face diﬃculties.
Moreover it does not suﬀer from the existence of eigenvalue degeneracies which
is another serious shortcoming of many methods. In the paper we apply the
algorithm to a few simple cases where the analytical solutions exist. Numerical
solutions have been investigated for the case of annular billiard.

I. INTRODUCTION

In spite of the fact that determining the spectrum of a cavity is certainly more than a
century old problem, numerical algorithms do not seem to abound, and moreover, they do
not seem always to solve the problem entirely. The references to known methods familiar to
us, do not seem to be always the original ones. However, these references apparently cover
all the main ideas used so far, with the exception of a few rather specialized algorithms.
We shall mention here only those methods which have the potential to be used for a rather
large class of billiard shapes and hopefully in more than two dimensions.

The ﬁrst type of algorithms amounts to determining the roots of a very high order
determinant [1–5]. This is not a very pleasant numerical task, as such a determinant easily
can vary by many orders of magnitude and the numerically null space is certainly another
major problem, which can and apparently does lead to spurious states. The variant suggested
in Ref. [5] is somewhat worse in some respect, as it requires determination of complex roots
of a complex valued determinant. Even though the spectrum of a cavity is real, when
implemented in an obvious and natural way the method used in Ref. [5] leads to spurious
states, the nature of which is mysterious. Moreover it has been shown recently that these
methods have also problems for nonconvex billiard geometries [6].

In Ref. [7,8] another method was used, which amounts to determining relatively sharp
minima of the norm of the wave function over the domain boundary. Such minima do not
seem to be always well deﬁned as there are some spurious minima as well, not so deep
however. Moreover it is not entirely clear how to disentangle single and multiple degenerate
states. The determination of all eigenstates requires multiple runs with randomly chosen
conditions [9]. The only way to decide whether all the eigenvalues have been found is by
comparing the determined average level density with the Weyl formula. Even though this
method seems to reveal all the eigenvalues in the end, it does appear to us to be a rather
time consuming procedure, needing a “constant outside intervention and evaluation” of the
results and thus requiring too much time.

A signiﬁcantly superior method, which apparently is free of many of the above drawbacks
was recently suggested in Ref. [10]. One of the major deﬁciencies of this method however is
its limitation to the so called star–shaped domains. A star–shaped domain is one for which ˆn
·
r > 0, where ˆn is the outward normal to the domain boundary and r is the position vector of
a point on the domain boundary with respect to an arbitrary origin within the domain. The
restriction to star–shaped domains excludes for example annular billiards, peanut–shaped
billiards and so forth, which are extremely interesting for various applications. Besides this,
a few rather small technical details, concerning its actual numerical implementation have
been only slightly covered in Ref. [10] and thus the numerical limitations of this method
are not entirely clear. But in any case, this method apparently is the most powerful one
available in literature so far.

Another method known to us is the constraint operator method presented in Ref. [11].
Although it allows to determine all eigenvalues in the truncated space, it does not seem to
be very accurate for some states, especially the high lying states. The reason could be that
It is also not

obvious whether it can actually be used for domains with holes for example.

In this paper we are suggesting an entirely diﬀerent method, which when correctly imple-

2

mented should lead to the determination of the whole eigenspectrum in a given interval. The
method might not necessarily be the fastest, as the method suggested in Ref. [10] is perhaps
faster. However, the method presented here should work for arbitrary shapes, unlike the
one in Ref. [10]. Its numerical implementation does not seem to suﬀer from any particular
and/or severe drawbacks.

over all possible orientations of the unit vectors ˆkn. Since in any numerical realization
an integral is always discretized in one way or another, we shall use a discrete summation
throughout most of this paper. (The interested reader should ﬁnd no diﬃculty in turning this
“approximate” representation into an “exact” one, if such a need arises.) The eigenvectors
and eigenvalues will be determined from the condition that the boundary norm vanishes,

the quantization condition Eq. (2.4) is satisﬁed only for discrete
values of k0. The determination of these eigenvalues and of their degeneracies is numerically
the most diﬃcult problem. For arbitrary values of k let us introduce the eigenvalues and

degeneracy of a root of λα(k), we have discussed above, see Rels. (2.6) and (2.7). Also, when
k is complex, when computing the BOM elements the bra–vectors are actually functions of
k∗, while the ket–vectors are functions of k. Only by deﬁning the BOM elements in this way
Onm(k) is an analytical function, therefore a function of k only and not a function of k and

The practical implementation of this algorithm is rather straightforward. There are

essentially a few relatively simple aspects one has to keep in mind:

•

One should divide the real k–axis in not too long intervals to be enclosed by a complex
. When computing the BOM eigenvalues λα(k) along such a contour one
contour

C

should use always the same number of basis wave functions ψn. When the basis is
increased, even though one might not gain in overall numerical accuracy, there is a
side eﬀect. Irrelevant eigenvalues λα(k) give a large contribution to the integrand in
Rel. (2.9) and thus changing the number of wave functions ψn along the contour leads
to erroneous results.

The total number of basis wave functions should be chosen somewhat larger than the
number of quantum states the boundary can accommodate in this energy range. For
example, for a 2–dimensional boundary one should have of the order of Lk/π plane
waves, where L is the length of the outer perimeter.

As the method gives the exact number of the eigenstates in a given energy interval, one
can easily narrow the interval so as to determine the exact location of any eigenstate
and its degeneracy as well, along with the corresponding eigenvector of the Helmholtz
close to the real k–axis. It is
equation. It is unavoidable to have parts of the contour
proﬁtable however to choose the imaginary part of the contour
not too far and not
to close to the real k–axis. A symmetric rectangular contour, with two sides parallel
to the real k–axis and two sides normal to it seems like a most reasonable and ﬂexible
choice. Parts of such a contour can be used repeatedly in order to narrow down the
position of the actual eigenvalues.

C

C

The matrix elements of BOM can diﬀer between each other by many orders of magni-
tude if the basis is large. It can aﬀect the numerical accuracy of the method. Therefore
it is recommended in such a case to rescale the BOM matrix: ˜

The imaginary part of the contour should be chosen at a distance of the order of the
mean level separation. At closer distances the integrand changes too rapidly with k,
while at larger distances from the real k–axis a signiﬁcantly increased and unnecessary
numerical accuracy might be required to compute the integrand.

The fact that
relatively low numerical accuracy can be used however.

As strange as it might sound, any of the known in the literature methods should encounter
most troubles for problems with high symmetries, especially in higher than two dimensions,
when high degeneracies are present. In such cases one has to determine not only the presence
of an eigenstate, but also its degeneracy. The problems without symmetries are easier in
this respect, as degeneracies are rare and accidental. However, once in a while an accidental
degeneracy might appear. When tunneling occurs, very closely spaced doublets appear in
the spectrum [12]. For the method presented here that does not seem to pose any challenges
(except perhaps the actual resolution of such a doublet, but not the determination of its
existence). The dimensionality of the problem appears to be largely irrelevant as well, except
for the obvious increase of the dimensionality of the BOM. Some of these aspects will be
illustrated in the next section.

In many instances one is interested in evaluating the ground state energy of a many

The contour could be a union of several contours, chosen in accordance with the “rules”
discussed above. In order to evaluate the ground state energy Egs one needs the position of
the Fermi level, which is determined by solving Eq. (2.19). The exact position of the other
eigenvalues are not needed and thus one has to determine exactly only a few eigenvalues
around the Fermi level.

III. A FEW PARTICULAR CASES

The examples we are going to discuss here are particularly instructive.

In many of
these cases some, most or all of the calculations can be performed analytically. Thus these
examples serve as an extremely useful guide through the potential numerical problems, some
of which we have alluded to in the previous section. In particular, from the exact expressions
for the BOM eigenvalues given below, it follows that for k
the integrand behaves
as λ′
into a straight

.

The contour integrals (2.9) and (2.12) can be evaluated analytically and they lead to the
expected exact results. One can see here explicitly that the roots of the BOM eigenvalues
have double multiplicities, as we have stated in the previous section.

If one considers a circular billiard of radius R, the BOM elements can be given analytically

Here J0(x) is the cylindrical Bessel function of ﬁrst kind and θ and θ′ determine the direction
of two unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates in an obvious manner, ˆk = (cos θ, sin θ). In a
rather limited so far numerical implementation of the present method we have established
that all of the exact solutions of the circular billiard are reproduced.

One can show that for the circular billiard the exact BOM eigenvectors and BOM eigen-
values (in the continuum limit when the number of basis plane waves is inﬁnite and N
)
→ ∞
are c(θ) = exp(imθ)/√2π and λm = J 2
m(kR) respectively, with an arbitrary integer m.
Therefore, the solution one obtains using the method described in the present paper leads
to the exact result for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Helmholtz equation with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Note again the fact that the roots of the BOM eigenvalues
λm have double multiplicities.

C. Annular Billiard

We shall consider now the billiard of radius R with a circular hard core of radius a < R,
with an oﬀset δ < R
a along the x–axis (see Fig. 1). For the numerical implementation
of the method for the annular billiard it is more convenient to use the basis wave function
in the form [13]:

−

ψn(kr, φa) = [Jm(kr)Ym(ka)

Ym(ka)Jm(kr)] exp(imφa),

(3.3)

−

where Jm and Ym are cylindrical Bessel functions of the ﬁrst and second kind, respectively.
This implies that the boundary conditions on the inner circle are automatically fulﬁlled.
One can convince oneself that the popular plane wave basis is inadequate in this case.
The simplest way to see this is by attempting to use a plane wave basis to represent the
present basis wave functions. If the Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind can be represented as a
superposition of plane wave of a given energy, the Bessel function of the second kind cannot.
Since the system is invariant with respect to the C2 symmetry the BOM matrix decomposes
into two blocks with the following matrix elements:

The number of basis states needed for the calculations up to the some value kmax
can be estimated from the condition that the only states contributing to the solution
should have at least one node associated with the radial motion inside the domain
i.e.
2 = 0. An increase of the basis aﬀects the computation time. The
∃r∈(a,1+δ)|
main contribution comes from the diagonalization of the BOM matrix along the integration
contour.
In the table I we have shown the dependence of the computation time on the
number of basis states ψn. Although the computation time is sensitive also to the precision
of the integration both in the (r, φ)
spaces, it depends approximately linearly on

the number of integration points whereas it exhibits the quadratic behavior as a function of
the number of basis states.

In the Figure 2 we have shown results of calculations performed for a = 0.5 and δ =

independent of k2 we have used the variable ǫ = k2 instead of k. The level density ρ was
obtained using L = 8 Fourier components in each interval ∆ǫ = 60, see Eq. (2.14). The

it was shown that the annular billiard is chaotic for δ > 0. However the
the fraction of the phase space occupied by chaotic trajectories
degree of chaoticity i.e.
a
depends on the eccentricity parameter δ. The system becomes fully chaotic for δ = 1
when all the trajectories must hit the inner circle. Thus the shell eﬀects visible in the Fig.
2 for δ = 0.25 are remnants of the ordered motion still existing in this case, see Refs. [15].
Associated orbits are characterized by the impact parameter L = sin α > a + δ (see Ref.
[14]) and forever encircle the inner disk. One can observe that the period of oscillations of
δE is larger for δ = 0.25. It is caused by the fact that the shortest periodic orbits giving
rise to the shell eﬀects at δ = 0 i.e. triangular and rectangular orbits, are destroyed in the
δ = 0.25 case.

Within the method presented in this paper we are also able to plot the density distribu-
tion of particular states. In Fig. 3 we have presented the densities of two states for δ = 0.0
and δ = 0.25 belonging to two representations of C2 denoted by (+) and (

D. n–dimensional billiards

For billiards in any dimensions the BOM elements have simple forms if either the en-
tire boundary or only parts of it have spherical/ellipsoidal (or 2d–circular/ellipse) shape,
planar/linear and/or any combinations of these shapes. The sphere/circle could be easily
deformed into an ellipsoid as well and one would still get simple expressions for the BOM
In particular for a spherical 3d–cavity one can show, similarly to the case of
elements.
the 2d–circular cavity, that the BOM eigenstates are as expected the spherical harmonics,
i.e. clm(θ, φ) = Ylm(θ, φ), and the BOM eigenvalues are λlm = j2
l, ..., l,
with spherical Bessel functions instead of cylindrical ones. This again shows that the BOM
method leads to the correct eigenstates.

The method introduced here appears ﬂexible enough to allow essentially a foolproof cal-
culation of the entire spectrum of an arbitrarily shaped billiard in any dimensions. We
believe also that the method can be optimized as well so as to speed up numerical calcu-
lations. In particular, the introduction of evanescent plane waves [16] is one aspect which
is worth a serious consideration, as it apparently leads to signiﬁcant increase of the numer-
ical accuracy [10]. Other boundary conditions, besides Dirichlet, can be implemented in a
straightforward manner too. We were in way rather surprised to realize that the present
method (which of course is nothing but a consequence of Cauchy’s theorem) is not appar-
ently being used in numerical analysis, as its implementation is rather straightforward. The
fact that this method is a “foolproof” one should make it a standard one whenever ﬁnding
roots of a rather large class of one variable functions is somewhat of a challenge.

for example, how many eigenstates they determine accurately around the point k0 in
the spectrum they choose and how to determine which eigenvalues are accurate enough.
To attain the high accuracy quoted in the paper the authors have to resort to a rather
high Taylor expansion of the surface norm they have introduced f[φ](k0) and it is not
clear how the “basic” method, explicitly described in the paper actually performs in
practice. It is not clear also how the method is aﬀected by various deﬁnitions of the null
space of the overlap matrix F (k0), as their deﬁnition of the null space appears to us as
somewhat too optimistic.

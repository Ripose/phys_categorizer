A series of calculations for the ﬁrst- and second-row post-d elements (Ga-Br and In-I) are pre-
sented using the phaseless auxiliary-ﬁeld quantum Monte Carlo (AF QMC) method. This method
is formulated in a Hilbert space deﬁned by any chosen one-particle basis, and maps the many-body
problem into a linear combination of independent-particle solutions with external auxiliary ﬁelds.
The phase/sign problem is handled approximately by the phaseless formalism using a trial wave func-
tion, which in our calculations was chosen to be the Hartree-Fock solution. We used the consistent
correlated basis sets of Peterson and coworkers, which employ a small core relativistic pseudopoten-
tial. The AF QMC results are compared with experiment and with those from density-functional
(GGA and B3LYP) and coupled-cluster CCSD(T) calculations. The AF QMC total energies agree
with CCSD(T) to within a few milli-hartrees across the systems and over several basis sets. The
calculated atomic electron aﬃnities, ionization energies, and spectroscopic properties of dimers are,
at large basis sets, in excellent agreement with experiment.

INTRODUCTION

We recently extended the phaseless auxiliary-ﬁeld
quantum Monte Carlo (AF QMC) approach [1] to any
single-particle basis, and applied it to the study of molec-
ular systems with Gaussian basis sets [2]. The calculated
all-electron total energies of many ﬁrst-row atoms and
molecules at their equilibrium geometries show typical
systematic errors of no more than a few milli-hartrees
(mEh) compared to exact results. This is roughly com-
parable to that of CCSD(T), coupled-cluster with single
and double excitations plus an approximate treatment of
triple excitations. For stretched bonds in H2O [2] as well
as N2 and F2 [3], the phaseless AF QMC exhibits bet-
ter overall accuracy and a more uniform behavior than
CCSD(T) in mapping the potential energy curve.

In this paper, we apply the new method to heavier sys-
tems and present a systematic study of several properties
of the ﬁrst- and second-row post-d elements (Ga-Br and
In-I). Our goal is to systematically benchmark the new
method in diﬀerent environments and to compare it to
experiment, as well as to a high level correlation method
such as CCSD(T).

Throughout this work, we used the consistent corre-
lated basis sets of Peterson and co-workers, which were
introduced recently for the ﬁrst-, second-, and third-row
non-transition metal post-d elements [4, 5]. These are
denoted by cc-pVnZ-PP (with n = D, T, Q, 5) [6], and
systematically converge to the complete basis set limit
much like the correlation consistent basis sets of Dun-
ning and co-workers for light atoms [7, 8].

The cc-pVnZ-PP basis sets are not all-electron ba-
sis sets. They employ a small-core relativistic pseu-
dopotential where the (n
1)spd semi-core electrons are
treated explicitly in the valence space, and only the [Ne],
[Ar]3d10, and [Kr]4d10 4f 14 cores are replaced by pseu-
dopotentials for the ﬁrst-, second-, and third-row ele-
ments, respectively. This is to be contrasted with large-

−

−

1)spd semi-core elec-
core pseudopotentials where the (n
trons are also removed by the pseudopotential procedure.
Large-core pseudopotentials retain a smaller number of
valence electrons, but this is done at the expense of de-
creasing the transferability of the pseudopotentials. For
example, it was shown that large-core pseudopotentials
would lead to an overestimation of the correlation energy
of the valence electrons compared to all-electron results
by as much as 10%. [9]

For heavier atoms, relativistic eﬀects become more im-
portant. A simple and straightforward way to include
the scalar relativistic eﬀects is through the use of rel-
ativistic pseudopotentials, which are constructed from
fully relativistic all-electron atomic calculations. Thus,
in these systems, relativistic pseudopotentials not only
reduce the number of electrons and basis size, but more
importantly, help to include scalar relativistic eﬀects in
a non-relativistic type calculation. The pseudopotentials
introduced with cc-pVnZ-PP are of very high quality, as
was veriﬁed by comparing relativistic all-electron calcu-
lations with those obtained using these pseudopotentials
[4, 5].

In electronic structure calculations, density functional
methods [10] are by far the most widely used. These
methods have low computational cost, and have allowed
accurate predictions of many properties. In the chemistry
community, hybrid exchange correlation functionals are
often used, with B3LYP perhaps the most popular choice.
These approaches are not without problems, however,
especially for systems with stronger electron correlation
eﬀects. There is so far no systematic way to improve
upon the current density functionals to allow suﬃciently
accurate and robust calculations over broad classes of
systems.

The exact full conﬁguration interaction (FCI) method
scales exponentially with the number of electrons and
is limited to the smallest systems. Among the corre-
lated methods, CCSD(T) is the most well-established.

For molecules, CCSD(T) is generally very accurate near
the equilibrium geometry, but its accuracy deteriorates
as bonds are stretched [11–13]. The application of
CCSD(T) to larger systems is also severely limited by its
computational cost, which grows as N 7 in basis size, as
well as by its large memory and disk space requirements.
Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are attrac-
tive due to their favorable scaling with system size. (In
our present implementation with Gaussian basis sets,
the method scales as N 3 to N 4 with basis size). QMC
methods approach the solution of the problem through
a stochastic sampling of the many-body wave function.
One price is that the statistical error only decays as the
square root of the computer time. A far more serious
problem, if uncontrolled, arises for Fermion wave func-
tions in the form of divergent statistical ﬂuctuations.
This is the well-known sign/phase problem [14–16].

No formal solution has been found for the sign/phase
problem. However, there are several QMC methods that
it. The most commonly used QMC method
control
for continuum systems is the real space diﬀusion Monte
Carlo (DMC) method, which uses the ﬁxed-node ap-
proximation [14] to control the sign problem. DMC has
been applied to calculate many properties of solids and
molecules [15]. An alternative, the auxiliary-ﬁeld QMC
(AF QMC) method, which is relatively new in ab ini-
tio calculations, uses the phaseless formalism to control
the phase problem [1]. This method has been applied
to sp-bonded atoms, molecules, and solids [1, 17, 18]
and transition metal molecules TiO and MnO [19], us-
ing a planewave basis and pseudopotentials. It was also
applied recently using a Gaussian basis to a variety of
ﬁrst-row atoms and molecules [2].

Compared with previous eﬀorts [20, 21] on realistic
electronic systems using the standard auxiliary-ﬁeld for-
malism [22, 23], the phaseless AF QMC method over-
comes the poor (exponential) scaling with system size
and projection time, and has statistical errors that are
well-behaved. The systematic error from the phaseless
approximation has proved small in the applications above
and, as we will show in the present study, in the heavier
post-d systems. All of these calculations have required
in the phaseless approximation only the Hartree-Fock or
density-functional solution as input.

The phaseless AF QMC method thus provides a many-
body framework for solving the Schr¨odinger equation
written in a Hilbert space spanned by some ﬁxed one-
particle basis, and systematically includes correlation ef-
fects by building stochastic ensembles of independent-
particle solutions. The method reduces the many-body
calculations to manipulations of single-particle orbitals,
which are therefore shared with typical electronic struc-
ture methods. For example, the localized basis approach
used in this paper imports the one- and two-body Hamil-
tonian matrix elements directly from standard quantum
chemistry calculations. This is appealing for quantum
chemistry, especially with the advanced status of ba-
sis sets which are tailored towards correlated methods

[4, 5, 7, 8]. For planewave basis sets, the AF QMC
methodology can take full advantage of well-established
techniques used by independent particle methods, such
as fast Fourier transforms. Pseudopotentials or eﬀec-
tive core potentials can be treated straightforwardly with
either basis. For the systems studied here, the use of
standard Gaussian basis sets resulted in a signiﬁcant eﬃ-
ciency gain compared to planewave pseudopotential cal-
culations [1, 2, 17–19].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
phaseless AF QMC method is ﬁrst brieﬂy reviewed in
the next section. In Sec. III, we present and discuss the
results of our calculations of the electron aﬃnity and ion-
ization energy of ﬁrst- and second-row post-d elements.
In Sec. IV, we will show our results for the dissociation
energies, equilibrium bondlengths, and angular frequency
of vibrations of three representative post-d dimers, As2,
Br2, and Sb2. Finally, in Sec. V we conclude with a brief
summary.

Equation (4) introduces one-body operators ˆvα which can
be deﬁned generally for any two-body operator by writing
α ζαˆv2
the latter in a quadratic form, such as ˆH2 =
α,
with ζα a real number. The many-body problem as de-
ﬁned by ˆH2 is now mapped into a linear combination
of non-interacting problems deﬁned by ˆvα, interacting
with external auxiliary ﬁelds. Averaging over diﬀerent
auxiliary-ﬁeld conﬁgurations is then performed by Monte
Carlo (MC) techniques. Formally, this leads to a rep-

The phaseless AF QMC method [1] used in this paper
controls the phase/sign problem in an approximate man-

is then approximated as a

phaseless constraint conﬁnes the random walk in Slater
determinant space according to its overlap with a trial
wave function. This overlap is a global property and is
diﬀerent from a nodal condition in real electronic con-
ﬁguration space [16]. Thus, the phaseless approximation
can behave diﬀerently from the ﬁxed node approximation
in DMC.

that cannot be eliminated systematically. In tests to date
[1, 2, 17–19], the trial wave function has been a single

lations, and the systematic error has proved quite small.
For example, in the ﬁrst-row elements and molecules, the
QMC energies agree to within a few mEh [2], with exact
values, using Hartree-Fock solutions as trial wave func-
tions.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: ATOMIC
PROPERTIES

As mentioned, our AF QMC method uses a trial wave
function to control the sign/phase problem. In general,
the trial wave function has to be in the form of a Slater
determinant or a linear combination of Slater determi-
nants.
In our previous study, we found that using the
unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) solution leads to QMC
energies which are in better agreement with exact en-
ergies than those obtained using the restricted Hartree-
Fock (RHF) Slater determinant. This was the case even

with singlets. QMC results obtained using density func-
tional generated trial wave functions lead to the same en-
ergies as Hartree-Fock generated wave functions, within
statistical errors [2].

We ﬁnd the same insensitivity of the AF QMC results
to the choice of trial wave function in post-d systems. In
Table I, we summarize our comparisons using the aug-
cc-pVDZ-PP basis set for the ﬁrst-row Ga-Br post-d ele-
ments. We carried out the QMC calculations using both
UHF and unrestricted B3LYP trial wave functions. As a
measure of the diﬀerence between the two Slater determi-
ˆH
nants, we show the variational energy,
, of the

|
, which is higher, of
ΨT i

course, than the UHF energy. Both QMC values are the
same within statistical errors.

For the rest of our study, we will always use the UHF
determinant as the trial wavefunction when it exists, and
the RHF solution otherwise. All of our QMC calculations
are performed with several Trotter time-steps, and we
report only the extrapolated values.

Table I shows that the QMC and CCSD(T) energies
agree to within a few mEh. This agreement is similar
to that found previously for the lighter systems com-
prised of ﬁrst-row atoms and molecules [2].
In that
study, CCSD(T) and QMC energies were found to be
roughly comparable in their agreement with exact values
[2]. (Both CCSD(T) and the present QMC method are
non-variational.)

All of the Hartree-Fock, density functional, and
coupled cluster calculations were carried out using
NWCHEM [28]. Some of them were also veriﬁed us-
ing Gaussian 98 [29]. For open shell systems, we used
the UHF as the reference state for the coupled cluster
calculations. For closed shell systems, we used the RHF
reference states, unless otherwise speciﬁed. [For example,
the dimers studied in Sec. IV are singlets, but their po-
tential energy curves were studied with both RCCSD(T)
and UCCSD(T).] All of our calculations were performed
using non-relativistic methods.

Finally, all of the QMC calculations in this paper cor-
related all the electrons in the wave function, i.e., no
frozen-core approximation was made. These results are
compared with those obtained using CCSD(T) with all
the valence electrons correlated, as well as with CCSD(T)
results obtained with only the valence ns and np electrons
correlated (denoted by CCSD(T)∗). We note that the
consistent correlation cc-pVnZ-PP basis sets used here
are in fact optimized for the correlation energy of the va-
lence electrons only [4, 5], but this does not aﬀect the
benchmarking of our results against CCSD(T).

A. Electron aﬃnity

Atomic electron aﬃnities calculated using diﬀerent
methods are summarized in Table II, for the aug-cc-
pVDZ-PP, aug-cc-pVTZ-PP, and aug-cc-pVQZ-PP basis
sets. We report the electron aﬃnities from UHF, GGA
[31], and hybrid B3LYP [32], as well as those from cor-
related methods, CCSD(T) and the present QMC. We
also show for comparison the frozen-core CCSD(T)∗ re-
sults [4, 5]. The experimental electron aﬃnities are from
Ref. [26]. Spin-orbit eﬀects have been approximately re-
moved by averaging over the atomic multiplets [27], ex-
cept in Se and Te for the lack of appropriate experimen-
tal data. Both the independent-electron and correlated
results show a smooth convergence with basis size, and
as expected the independent-electron results have faster
convergence.

Results obtained using density functional GGA and
hybrid B3LYP methods are generally in reasonable agree-

at the triple-zeta level basis to less than 1 kcal/mol. GGA
and B3LYP are comparable in terms of their agreement
with the experimental data, with GGA being slightly bet-
ter. The worst cases for B3LYP are Sb and As where the
experimental values are overestimated by
6 kcal/mol.
On the other hand, GGA overestimates the experimental
values by

3 kcal/mol.

The electron aﬃnities obtained using CCSD(T) and
QMC methods are in better agreement with experiment
than GGA or B3LYP results at the aug-cc-pVTZ-PP ba-
sis set level, and the agreement reaches chemical accuracy
with the quadruple-ζ basis set. CCSD(T) and QMC are
comparable, with deviations of
4 kcal/mol for all
the basis sets studied and for all systems. Similar agree-
ment is also seen in the total energies, which are shown in
Table III. The average absolute diﬀerence between QMC
and CCSD(T) energies for this set is 1.2(7) mEh, with

CCSD(T) is similar.

B.

Ionization energy

Our CCSD(T) calculations for the electron aﬃnities
are in good agreement with the CCSD(T)∗ calculations.
The eﬀects of the frozen-core approximation on the elec-
tron aﬃnity are minimal due to the cancellation of the
frozen-core error between the atom and the ion.
In
addition to the three basis sets which we used in our
study, Peterson and co-workers report on frozen-core
CCSD(T) calculations using aug-cc-pV5Z-PP basis sets
[4, 5]. Their electron aﬃnities using the quadruple and
quintuple-ζ basis sets agree to less than 1 kcal/mol with
each other.

Ionization energies for the ﬁrst- and second-row post-d
elements using diﬀerent methods are shown in Table IV.
The organization is similar to that in Table II for the
electron aﬃnities. The experimental energies are from
Ref.
[30] with spin-orbit eﬀects approximately removed
by averaging over the multiplets [27].

Both the GGA and the hybrid B3LYP density func-
tional methods are in good agreement with each other
and also with the experimental values. Here also as
with the electron aﬃnity, GGA seems to do better
than B3LYP. The results suggest that the independent-

electron ionization potentials are already converged at
the double-zeta level of basis sets.

The correlated ionization energy calculations, namely
CCSD(T) and QMC, are in very good agreement with
each other for all the basis sets and all the atoms. The
largest diﬀerence between them is for Ga and is
0.1 eV.
The agreement between the total energies of the posi-
tively charged ions (not shown) obtained using CCSD(T)
and QMC is similar to those shown in Table III, and the
average absolute diﬀerence is < 2 mEh over all basis sets.
The agreement between QMC or CCSD(T) with exper-
iment improves with basis size as expected, and is very
good at the QZ level.

≈

As seen in Table IV, both CCSD(T) calculations with
and without the frozen-core approximation are in excel-
lent agreement with each other for the ionization energy.
Moreover, similar to the case of the electron aﬃnity, both
CCSD(T) results show a smooth convergence with basis
size towards the experimental values.

To our knowledge, our study of the ionization energies
is the ﬁrst of the post-d elements with the cc-pVnZ-PP
basis sets. Our coupled cluster results are in good agree-
ment with coupled cluster calculations obtained using all-
electron consistent correlation basis sets [34]. There has

also been a study using G2 theory of the ﬁrst-row ele-
ments, in which the computed ionization energies were
in good agreement with experiment [35].

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: DIMERS

We chose As2, Br2, and Sb2 to study, as represen-
tatives of the ﬁrst- and second-row post-d dimers.
In
Table V, we summarize our study of their dissociation
energy, equilibrium bondlength, and angular frequency
of vibration using diﬀerent methods, with the cc-pVDZ-
PP and cc-pVTZ-PP basis sets. Spin-orbit eﬀects in the
experimental values [30, 33] are approximately removed
[27].

Within each method, the equilibrium bondlength and
angular frequency of vibrations are calculated from a ﬁt
to the potential energy curves of the dimers. The to-
tal energies for 8-9 geometries over the range
≤
R
0.7 Angstroms are ﬁtted by 4-7th order polyno-
mials, which gave consistent results. The dissociation en-
ergy of the dimers at the RHF, GGA, and B3LYP level of
theories are calculated using the equilibrium bondlength
at the same level of theory and using the same basis.

Calculations are done using cc-pVDZ-PP basis set. The solid
lines are based on a polynomial ﬁt to the results.

For the correlated calculations, Table V tabulates the
calculated equilibrium bondlength, but the dissociation
energies that are shown were calculated using the equi-
librium geometry optimized with CCSD(T)∗, i.e., at the
CCSD(T) level of theory with only the ns and np elec-
trons correlated. This was done to facilitate the com-
parisons between the diﬀerent methods. The dissocia-
tion energies at the respective optimized geometries will
change by 1 kcal/mol or less.

First, we discuss the density functional results. We
have veriﬁed that the density functional GGA and hy-
brid B3LYP dissociation energies are already converged
at the cc-pVTZ-PP basis set. Our dissociation energy
results using cc-pVQZ-PP basis sets (not shown) dif-
fer from those reported at cc-pVTZ-PP by less than
1 kcal/mol, the equilibrium bondlengths by less than
0.005 Angstrom, and the angular frequencies by less
1. The density functional dissociation en-
than 1 cm−
ergies are in reasonable agreement with the experimen-
tal values. GGA overestimates the binding energies by
5 kcal/mol, while B3LYP is in good agreement with
≈
experiment. The bondlengths are overestimated with
GGA and slightly underestimated with B3LYP. Angular
frequencies in GGA and B3LYP are in better agreement
with each other, with the GGA frequencies being in good
agreement with experimental values.

We next comment on the coupled cluster results with
and without the frozen-core approximation. Contrary to
the atomic properties, the dissociation energy, equilib-
rium bondlengths, and the angular frequency are more
sensitive to the frozen-core approximation. The basis
sets used in this study are optimized to recover the cor-
relation energy of the valence electrons, and thus are less
eﬀective in accessing the core-valence correlation eﬀects.
In Refs. [4, 5], the frozen-core CCSD(T) calculations
of the spectroscopic properties of several dimers are in
good agreement with the experimental values with the
cc-PV5Z-PP basis sets.

We now focus on the QMC results, and their compar-
ison with CCSD(T) and experiment. As mentioned, all
of the QMC calculations were obtained using the UHF
solution as trial wave function. QMC and CCSD(T) dis-
sociation energies are in good agreement with each other.
The QMC total energies for the atoms are within 1 mEh
of the CCSD(T) values, as reported before in the study of
the ionization energies in Sec. III B. The QMC energies
of the dimers, on the other hand, are below the CCSD(T)

values by
3 mEh for the two basis sets and for all
the studied dimers. This does not necessarily mean that
QMC values are in better agreement with exact values,
because these QMC calculations are non-variational (as is
CCSD(T)). In our previous study of the ﬁrst-row atoms
and molecules where some exact values were available,
our comparisons showed that the exact values often fell
between the CCSD(T) and QMC values.[2]

The bondlengths and the angular frequency of vibra-
tions obtained with QMC and CCSD(T) are in less good
agreement with each other, compared to the dissociation
energies. In Fig. 1, we show the potential energy curves
of As2, Br2, and Sb2 dimers within the cc-pVDZ-PP basis
set, as calculated with QMC, and both RCCSD(T) and
UCCSD(T) which are based on RHF and UHF reference
states, respectively. In As2/cc-pVDZ-PP, we could not
obtain the RCCSD(T) energies for some of the geome-
tries (R
2.45 Angstroms) due to the lack of
−
convergence, as can be seen in Fig. 1.

Figure 2 shows the potential energy surface of Br2
within the cc-pVTZ-PP basis sets, as calculated using
CCSD(T) and the present QMC. In this case, we show
only the RCCSD(T) values, because we could not obtain
a UHF solution in this system for the cc-pVTZ-PP basis
set at the bondlengths shown.

For singlets, the RCCSD(T) is generally more accu-
rate near the equilibrium bondlength, while UCCSD(T)
performs better for larger bondlengths near the dis-
sociation limit. Both the QMC and RCCSD(T) en-
ergies are in excellent agreement near the equilibrium
bondlength (with QMC slightly lower). However, as
the bondlength is stretched, RCCSD(T) becomes less
accurate, and for relatively small bondlength stretching
UCCSD(T) is also inaccurate [11, 12]. QMC, on the other
hand, has been shown to give a more uniform descrip-
tion across the whole potential energy surface in ﬁrst-
row molecules [2, 3]. Given these results, especially our
benchmark study on N2 [3], it seems reasonable to specu-
late that a signiﬁcant portion of the discrepancy at larger
bondlengths between QMC and CCSD(T) is due to errors
in the latter. Further study is needed to better establish
this.

V. SUMMARY

To further benchmark the recently introduced phase-
less auxiliary-ﬁeld QMC method, we have applied it to

9

heavier systems using a Gaussian basis. We performed
a systematic study of the ﬁrst- and second-row non-
transition metal post-d elements using the consistent cor-
relation basis sets cc-pVnZ-PP [4, 5] which employ a
small-core relativistic pseudopotentials. Our results for
the electron aﬃnities and the ﬁrst ionization potentials
of these elements are in excellent agreement with similar
results calculated using CCSD(T) over double-, triple-,
and quadruple-zeta basis sets. The corresponding ener-
gies of the atoms and the ions agree with the CCSD(T)
values, with an average diﬀerence of less than 1 mEh.
Our results obtained using the quadruple zeta basis set
are in excellent agreement with experimental results.

We also studied the dimers As2, Br2, and Sb2 us-
ing cc-pVDZ-PP and cc-pVTZ-PP basis sets. At the
triple-zeta level, the calculated spectroscopic properties
are in good agreement with experiment. Our results
for the dissociation energies are in excellent agreement
with CCSD(T) within each basis set. The equilibrium
bondlength and the angular frequency of vibrations are
also in good agreement with similar CCSD(T) results
considering the somewhat large statistical errors on the
QMC results. The potential energy curves for all of
these molecules are in good agreement with CCSD(T)
for bondlengths smaller than the equilibrium bondlength.
For larger bondlengths, and especially in As2 and Sb2,
the QMC results deviate signiﬁcantly (
10 mEh) from
both RCCSD(T) and UCCSD(T). Both coupled cluster
methods are less accurate in these regions [11–13], and
QMC has been shown to give better accuracy and a more
uniform behavior in H2O, N2, and F2 [2, 3]. The devia-
tions between QMC and CCSD(T) here seem consistent
with these benchmark results in lighter systems.

Abstract

A full simulation of a transition radiation detector (TRD) based on the GEANT,
GARFIELD, MAGBOLTZ and HEED codes has been developed. This simulation
can be used to study and develop TRD for high energy particle identiﬁcation using
either the cluster counting or the total charge measurement method. In this article it
will be also shown an application of this simulation to the discrimination of electrons
from hadrons in beams of momentum of few GeV /c or less, assuming typical TRD
conﬁguration, namely radiator–detector modules.

Key words: Monte Carlo; Full Simulation; Transition Radiation; TRD; Charge

1 Introduction

Transition radiation (TR) is an electromagnetic radiation produced by
ultrarelativistic charged particles crossing the interface between two materials
with diﬀerent dielectric properties [1,2]. The TR spectrum is peaked in the
X-ray region and the probability of a X-ray photon being emitted at each
interface is of the order of α ≃ 1/137. The transition radiation yield is
proportional to the Lorentz factor γ of the incident charged particle and is
independent on the kind of particle. That oﬀers an attractive alternative to
identify particles of given momentum with a non destructive method.

In order to enhance the TR X-ray production, radiators consisting of several
hundred foils regularly spaced or irregular radiators of few cm of thickness
consisting of carbon compound foam layers or ﬁber mats are usually adopted.
The “multilayer” radiator introduces signiﬁcant physical constraints on the
radiation yield, because of the so-called “interference eﬀects”. It has been
established that the radiation emission threshold occurs at a Lorentz factor
γth = 2.5ωpd1, where ωp is the plasma frequency (in eV units) of the foil
material, and d1 is its thickness in µm. For γ ≥ γth the radiation yield increases
up to a saturation value given by γsat ∼ γth(d2/d1)1/2, where d2 is the width
of the gap between the foils [3].

The conventional method of TR detection is the measurement of the sum of
the energy released by ionization and from photoelectrons produced by TR
X-rays. The radiating particle, if not deﬂected by magnetic ﬁelds, releases
its ionization energy in the same region as the X-ray photons, introducing a
background signal that can be reduced if a gaseous detector is used. Since
the gas must provide eﬃcient conversion of the TR photons, the use of high-
Z gases is preferred. The detector usually consists of proportional chambers
ﬁlled with argon or xenon with a small addition of quenching gases for gain
stabilization (CO2, CH4).

The measurement of TR using proportional chambers is generally based on
one or both of the following methods:

• the “charge measurement” method, where the signal collected from a

chamber wire is charge analyzed by ADCs [4];

• the “cluster

sharply
counting” method, where the wire signal
diﬀerentiated in order to discriminate the X-ray photoelectron clusters
producing pulses (hits) exceeding a threshold amplitude from the δ-ray
ionization background [5].

is

In both cases a cut on the analyzed charge or on the number of clusters is
needed in order to discriminate radiating particles from slower nonradiating
ones. Multiple module TRDs, with optimized gas layer thickness, are normally
employed to improve background rejection. A reduced chamber gap limits the
particle ionizing energy losses, while the X-rays escaping detection may be
converted in the downstream chambers.

Transition radiation detectors are presently of
interest in fast particle
identiﬁcation, both in accelerator experiments [6,7] and in cosmic ray physics
[8]-[16]. A TRD is used to evaluate the underground cosmic ray muon energy
spectrum in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory [17]. In spite of their use in
several high energy experiments, a simulation code is not yet available in the
standard simulation tools.

Several codes based on parameterizations of test beam measurements have

2

been developed to simulate the TRDs [18,19]. Lately a TRD has been proposed
in a Long Base Neutrino Oscillation Experiment [20], in which a simulation
has been developed using a GEANT interface [21]. The results achieved in the
last experience have been rather satisfactory, in spite of some diﬃculties to
track low energy photons in GEANT.

In this paper a full simulation of a TRD is described. The program is based
on GEANT [22], GARFIELD [23], MAGBOLTZ [24] and HEED [25] codes in
order to exploit the best performances in each one. In this way a full simulation
has been developed tracking the particles into the detector and producing the
pulse shape from each proportional tubes.

2 Transition radiation emission

Extensive theoretical studies have been made about TR. The basic properties
of the TR production as well as the interference phenomena in multifoil
radiator stacks are rather well understood and well described with classical
electromagnetism (for instance see [26]). There was also an attempt to give a
quantum description of TR [27]. The quantum corrections to the TR intensity
become interesting for the emission of very high energy photons, namely when
the TR photon energy is comparable with the energy of the radiating particle.
Therefore they are no longer signiﬁcant in the X-ray region for incident charged
particle of momenta of few GeV /c and the expressions derived are similar
to the classical theory. Therefore, the TR emission is described for practical
purposes by classical formulation, and the TR energy is considered carried out
by photons (quanta).

As shown by Artru et al. [3] the TR energy W emitted from a stack of N foils
of thickness d1 at regular distances d2, without taking into account absorption
eﬀects, can be written as:

z1 of the foil material:

(cid:16)

−1

(cid:17)

The last factor of eq. (1) describes the coherent interference of TR in a stack
composed of N foils and gaps at regular distances d2. φ = φ1 + φ2 is the total
phase angle of one basic foil plus gap, with φ2 being deﬁned in analogy to
φ1. The TR X-ray energy distribution can be obtained by taking the ratio of
equation (1) to ω.

Since the TR yield from multifoil stack is described as an interference
phenomenon due to whole radiator, in order to calculate the total TR quanta
emitted by the particle crossing the radiator, one needs to known the total
number of foils crossed. Therefore it is not possible to follow the particle into
radiator in order to calculate the probability to emit a quantum in a given
step, i.e. we do not have a cross section for the TR eﬀect. That may introduce
some diﬃculties to simulate the TR process. Moreover, the TR intensity is a
complex function of the thicknesses d1 and d2, of the plasma energies ω1 and
ω2 for a given γ Lorentz factor. This behaviour may introduce an additional
diﬃculty to calculate the TR spectra for any kind of radiators.

The energy of the TR photons depends on the radiator material and its
structure. In ref. [3] it is shown that the average TR energy carried out by
quanta is given by:

< ω >≃ 0.3 γth ω1

(4)

Assuming d1 = 10 µm and ω1 = 20 eV one obtains γth ∼ 500 and
< ω >∼ 3 keV . This may introduce some diﬃculties to track soft X-ray
photons in a medium.

The ability to identify particles by a TRD is determined by the relative
amounts of TR and ionization energy loss in the proportional chambers. Large
ﬂuctuations of ionization loss in thin gas layers limit this methods. Therefore,
in order to better understand the performance of a TRD, one needs careful
calculations of ionization energy loss and its ﬂuctuations, producing knock-on
or δ-electrons. On the other hand, if one would like to use the cluster counting
method to separate the TR X-ray from the track ionization background, then
the range and the size of δ-electron and of photoelectron, the number of

4

electron–ion pairs produced in the gas and their arrival time on the wire need
to be taken into account. Finally the current produced on the anode wire of
the gas chambers and its pulse shape fed to discriminator by the front end
electronics also play an important role in this method.

3 TRD full simulation

On the basis of the above discussion, the approach followed to simulate a TRD
is based on the codes GEANT, GARFIELD, MAGBOLTZ and HEED (the
last two codes are used by GARFIELD). The geometric description of the
detector has been given by GEANT, including the simulation of all physical
processes that occur in the materials crossed by the particles. The ionization
energy loss and the photoelectric process in the gas have been not considerated
in the GEANT code, because they are simulated by HEED.

When charged particles cross the gas of proportional chambers, or photons
are entering into these volumes, the HEED package is called. In this way
the ionization energy loss and the electron–ion pairs distribution along the
track are calculated. The photoelectric absorption of photons in the gas is
also simulated, including the evaluation of the photoelectrons produced and
the total number of electron–ion pairs. Finally the current pulse produced on
the anode wire is evaluated by the GARFIELD code using the gas properties
as its drift velocity and gain calculated by the MAGBOLTZ program as a
function of the electric ﬁeld.

3.1 TR process

The GEANT code does not simulate transition radiation. In order to produce
the TR photons in GEANT, a physical process has been introduced whenever
a relativistic charged particle crosses the radiator.

The TR photon energy spectrum and the mean number of X-ray are calculated
for the input radiator and for the energy of primary particle which one
simulates. When the charged particle crosses the radiator and comes out
the TR process is activated. The total number of TR photons is generated
according to a Poisson distribution if their average number is less than 10,
otherwise a Gaussian distribution may be used. The energy of each TR X-ray
is randomly generated according to a calculated spectrum and its position
is generated along the radiating particle path at the end of a radiator. The
produced TR photons are then treated as secondary particles in GEANT and
they are stored in the common block GCKING. In order to be transported

5

by GEANT, these photons are stored in the data structure JSTAK by the
GSKING routine.

3.1.1 TR formulas used in the code

The TR production relations used in this simulation take into account the
photon absorption in the radiator. This eﬀect has been simulated using the
GEANT absorption lengths of the photons calculated for this material.

where σ = d1/λ1 + d2/λ2 is the absorption in one foil + one gap and λ1 and λ2
are the absorption lengths for the emitted radiation in two media as calculated
by GEANT (see paragraph 3.2).

For large values of the number of foils N, the δ function can be assumed
to approximate the last two factors of the above expression. Making this

Nequ is the number of equivalent foils when the absorption is take into account.

To evaluate the total number of TR photons the numerical calculation of
equation (6) has been carried out at selected X-ray energies (ω), from 1 keV
to 100 keV , with a precision better than 10−3. In Fig. 1 the TR spectra for a

6

regular radiator, evaluated taking into account the absorption in the radiator,
are shown. They are calculated from the eq. (6). This ﬁgure shows a broad
peak around 3 − 5 keV energy, corresponding to TR mean energy produced
by the regular radiator adopted.

Irregular radiator
The transition radiation has been observed in irregular materials consisting
for instance of plastic foams. A general formulation of the spectral distribution
of the number of TR X-ray quanta produced in a irregular medium, consisting
of randomly parralel plates of arbitrary thickness, is given by Garibian et al.
[28]. This formulation has been given with the plates arranged in vacuum. It
has been modiﬁed to take into account the presence of a material in the gap.

The average number of radiation quanta taking into account the absorption

The angle brackets denote the averaging of random quantities with a

For most of foam radiators the random foil and the gap thickness can be
described by a gamma distribution [29]. In this way one ﬁnds that [28]:

The parameters αk represent the degree of irregularity: αk = (< dk > /σk)2
where < dk > and σk are the mean values and the mean squared deviations
respectively of foil (k = 1) and gap (k = 2) thickness distributions.

3.2 Use of the GEANT package

The GEANT 3.21 code is used to describe the geometrical volumes inside the
detector and to deﬁne the materials. It has been done by the standard GEANT
routine taking care of tracking parameters in order to deﬁne the active physical
processes and the cuts (GSTPAR). In this way, the photons are tracked using
the GEANT absorption coeﬃcients and the gamma cuts have been lowered to
1 keV in all the materials.

The materials used, which are not deﬁned in the default GEANT program,
have been implemented using the standard routine (GSMATE or GSMIXT).
The radiators have been deﬁned as a mixture composed by the foil material
and the gap material (air) containing the proportion by weights of each
material. The foil materials and the gas chamber walls have been deﬁned
as compounds containing the proportion by number of atoms of each kind
[22].

In Fig. 2 the photon attenuation lengths calculated by GEANT for
polyethylene (CH2, ρ = 0.93 g/cm3), kapton (C22H10N2O5, ρ = 1.42 g/cm3)
and mylar (C5H4O2, ρ = 1.05 g/cm3) are shown. In this ﬁgure one can see
that the kapton photon attenuation length is always less than polyethylene
and the photon attenuation length for kapton is the same as for mylar.

The gas chambers are the sensitive volume of the TRD and for each charged
particle crossing the gas or for each photons absorbed inside, a GEANT HITS
structure is deﬁned to describe the interaction between particle and detector.
In the HITS structure the following information are stored:

• HITS(1) = number of volume level (by GEANT);
• HITS(2) = energy loss in the gas (by HEED);

8

• HITS(3) = input time in the volumes (by GEANT);
• HITS(4:6) = x, y and z of entry point in the volume (by GEANT);
• HITS(7:9) = x, y and z of exit point in the volume (by GEANT);
• HITS(10) = number of cluster produced in the gas (by HEED);
• HITS(11) = number of electron–ion pairs produced in the gas (by HEED);
• HITS(12:111) = current pulse on the wire for 100 time slices (by

GARFIELD).

The DIGIT structure is similar to the HITS one, where the information are
stored as a sum of all particles crossing that volume, while the input and the
output coordinate are relative to the primary particle which has crossed the
chamber.

The event processing is a highly CPU consuming job. To optimize CPU usage
DST ﬁles are produced to be analyzed at a later time. For each event the
GEANT ZEBRA data structures containing the geometrical deﬁnition, the
input kinematics, the tracking banks (JXYZ) and the simulated detector
response (HITS and DIGIT banks) are stored in DST ﬁles which provide
the input data set for the analyses to be performed. In this way, the electronic
response of the chamber front end can be implemented starting by the anode
current impulse. In order to save some run informations the HEADER bank
is also used by the GSRUNG routine.

3.3 Use of the GARFIELD package

The GARFIELD program has been developed to simulate gaseous wire
chambers operating in proportional mode. It can be used for instance to
calculate the ﬁeld maps and the signals induced by charged particles, taking
both electron pulse and ion tail into account. An interface to the MAGBOLTZ
program is provided for the computation of electron transport properties in
nearly arbitrary gas mixtures. Starting from version 6, GARFIELD has also
an interface with the HEED program to simulate ionization of gas molecules
by particles traversing the gas chamber. A few examples of GARFIELD results
can ﬁnd via WWW [23,25].

The HEED program computes in detail the energy loss of fast charged particles
in gases, taking δ-electrons and optionally multiple scattering of the incoming
particle into account. The program can also simulate the absorption of
photons through photo-ionization in gaseous detectors. From this program, the
distribution of electron–ion pairs along the particle track length in the gas has
been computed by GARFIELD. Some modiﬁcations have been included in the
GARFIELD default version in order to calculate the cluster size distribution
of photons absorbed in the gas by HEED. Starting from these cluster size

9

distributions the current anode wire signal is calculated by GARFIELD.

In Fig. 3 the pair distribution produced by 5.9 keV photons (55Fe) in 1 cm
of xenon at NTP is shown. From this ﬁgure one can see the presence of a
mean peak of about 270 electron–ion pairs due to the photoelectron and the
Auger electron. There is also a secondary peak due to occasional detection of
a photoelectron whitout Auger emission.

In this TRD simulation the GARFIELD 6.27 version has been used. From
the source ﬁles of GARFIELD program, written in Fortran 77 and Patchy
as pre-processor, the main routines have been included in the code together
with the GEANT routines. Some modiﬁcations have been introduced in order
to skip interactive input information used by GARFIELD. All information to
run the program are given via FFREAD data card. The cell deﬁnition and
the gas composition of the chambers to be simulated have been processed in
initialization of the program.

4 Program description

The main items of this simulation have already been described in the above
discussion. In this section an example of how the program works is given. It has
been written in Fortran by patchy as pre-processor on a PC 166 MHz, 80 MB
of RAM, in the LINUX system (RedHat 5.2 version). It is transportable on
any system changing some patchy control ﬂags in cradle ﬁles.

There are two codes: the ﬁrst is dedicated to event simulation for DST
production; the second one is used to analyze the DST ﬁles including a
graphical interface too. The input of these program is given via data cards
by FFREAD facility. The user inputs for the ﬁrst program are stored in the
run header bank after the initialization to be used by the second one.

4.1 Geometry

The geometry used to simulate a TRD consists of 10 radiator-proportional
chamber modules. The radiator consists of 250 polyethylene foils of 5 µm of
thickness at regular distances of 200 µm in air. The chamber consists of two
planes of 16 cylindrical proportional tubes each of 2 mm of radius (straw tubes)
to form a double layer close pack conﬁguration. These tubes are widely used
in recent high energy physics experiments [19,30]. Since the typical materials
used for the tube wall are made by carbon compounds (kapton, mylar and
polycarbonate) and their thickness are typically 30 − 50 µm, the straw tubes

10

are good candidate to be used as X-ray detector due to the reduced attenuation
length of the wall.

In this simulation the straw tube walls are made of kapton of 30 µm thickness
internally coated with copper of 0.3 µm thickness. The anode wire used is of
25 µm thickness. The gas mixture used is based on Xe(80%) − CO2(20%) at
atmospheric pressure. The anode voltage used is 1450 V olt which corresponds
to a gas gain of about 2 · 104.

4.2 Front end electronic

The front end electronic used in this simulation consists of a simply ampliﬁer
which is described by a low band-pass transfer function with a bandwidth of
50 MHz and an overall gain of 10:

˜A(ω) = A0

1

1 + i

ω
ω0

(9)

(10)

(11)

where A0 = 10 mV /µA and ω0 = 50 MHz.

The anode current produced in the proportional tubes as a function of the
time I(t) is converted in the output voltage amplitude V (t) by:

V (t) =

I(t′) A(t − t′) dt′

∞

t
Z

where A(t) is the Fourier transform of ˜A(ω):

ω0 e−ω0 t , if t ≥ 0

, otherwise

A(t) = 


0



In this example no noise is assumed. Of course a real electronics is described
by a more complex transfer function with an electronic noise.

In Fig. 4 a typical anode signal from a tube produced by a X-ray of 5.9 keV
(55Fe) is shown. When this signal is processed by the low band-pass it assumes
the shape reported in Fig. 5. From this ﬁgure one can see that the electronics
performed a formation of the input signal with a FWHM of about 25 nsec.

In Fig. 6 is shown a typically anode signal produced by a charged particle
crossing a tube. In this ﬁgure one can see two peaks are produced by two
clusters. The low band-pass cannot allow to distinguish the two clusters since
the second one is superimposed to ﬁrst one (signal pile-up) as shown in Fig.

11

7, because their time distance is lower than the FWHM of the electronic
resolution.

4.3 Results

In this paragraph the results achieved by the TRD geometry deﬁned above are
shown. In Fig. 8 the average energy loss (summed over 10 planes) as function
of the Lorentz factor is shown. This result has been obtained by simulating
pions and electrons of diﬀerent energies with or without radiators. For each
energy 1000 events have been simulated.

In this ﬁgure one can see that the yield increases with γ when the radiators
are arranged before the proportional tubes. The TR saturation is achieved at
γ ≃ 8000. For γ less than 100–500 only the ionization is released in the gas,
as is shown in the same ﬁgure.

In Fig. 9 the average energy loss distributions (summed over 10 planes) for
electrons of 4 GeV /c and pions of 255 MeV /c are shown. From this ﬁgure it
is possible to see that the average value of the electron distribution is greater
than the average for pions. This is due to presence of the X-ray TR produced
in the radiator by the electrons.

In order to perform the cluster size analysis, one needs to know the relationship
between the output signal amplitude and the energy loss in the tube. Therefore
an analysis of voltage amplitude has been done using X-rays of 5.9 keV (55Fe).
In Fig. 10 is shown the output voltage amplitude distribution produced by a
55Fe X-rays absorbed in a proportional tube. From this ﬁgure one can see that
the energy loss of 5.9 keV corresponds to 170 mV of output voltage amplitude.

In order to count the number of hits produced for instance by TR photons and
by δ-ray with energy greater than 5 keV , a cut of 145 mV is imposed to the
voltage amplitude signal produced in each tube. In Fig. 11 the average total
number of hits (summed over all ﬁred tubes) when the output signal is greater
than 145 mV as function of γ is shown. The behaviour of the TRD when is
analyzed by the cluster counting method is similar to the charge measurement
one.

In Fig. 12 the distributions of the total number of hits for electrons of
4 GeV /c and pions of 255 MeV /c are shown. Again we can observe that
the average value of the electron distribution is greater than the one of the
pion distribution, due to presence of the X-ray TR produced in the radiator
by the electrons.

In order to discriminate electrons from pions at given momentum by charge

12

measurement or by cluster counting, we can use this simulation to optimize
the gas thickness, the radiator, the threshold and the number of modules.
In this way, we can optimize one of these methods or we can use more
sophisticated ones, for example analyzing the pulse shape as function of the
drift time or using the likelihood and/or neural network analysis by the pattern
information, namely the ﬁred tube conﬁguration in the TRD.

5 Conclusions

A full simulation of a transition radiation detector (TRD) based on the
GEANT, GARFIELD, MAGBOLTZ and HEED codes has been developed.
The simulation can be used to study and develop TRD for high energy particle
identiﬁcation using either the cluster counting or the total charge measurement
method. The program works very well according to the design expectations.
It is quite ﬂexible and it can be used to simulate any detector which is based
on proportional counters, providing a very useful simulation tool.

Locating the global minimum of a complex potential en-
ergy surface is facilitated by considering a homotopy, namely
a family of surfaces that interpolate continuously from an ar-
bitrary initial potential to the system under consideration.
Diﬀerent strategies can be used to follow the evolving min-
ima. It is possible to enhance the probability of locating the
global minimum through a heuristic choice of interpolation
schemes and parameters, and the continuously evolving po-
tential landscape reduces the probability of trapping in lo-
cal minima. In application to a model problem, ﬁnding the
ground–state conﬁguration and energy of rare–gas (Lennard–
Jones) atomic clusters, we demonstrate the utility and eﬃcacy
of this method.

Introduction: Global optimization problems [1] can of-
ten be formulated in terms of ﬁnding the minimum (or
maximum) of a multidimensional potential energy sur-
face (PES). Such problems, which occur in a variety of ar-
eas, are of considerable practical and theoretical interest
[2]. The “energy landscape” [3] paradigm is particularly
useful when the potential energy function is continuously
varying with the physical conﬁgurations relevant to the
problem . An example of such a situation is the protein–
folding problem [4], namely determining the native con-
ﬁguration of complex molecules given their atomic com-
position. A simpler variant is the determination of the
ground state conﬁguration of atomic or molecular clus-
ters [5].

In this Letter we propose a new homotopy method to
study such problems by a controlled deformation of the
potential energy surface. If Vf is the potential energy hy-
persurface under consideration, we study the landscapes

V (α) = (1 − α)Vi + αVf ,

(1)

with α a parameter. Given a choice of initial potential,
Vi, this is a 1–parameter family of potential energy sur-
faces which smoothly evolves from Vi into Vf as α varies
from 0 → 1.

The minima of the landscapes continuously change
with α, and in order to track them, one of two strate-
gies are possible. Varying the interpolation parameter α
in a ﬁnite number of steps, a standard technique such
as conjugate gradient (CG) minimization [6] can be em-
ployed at each α. On the other hand, one can consider α
as a time–dependent function such that the PES evolves
according to

V (t) = (1 − h(t))Vi + h(t)Vf ,

(2)

where h(t) is suitably chosen with h(0) = 0, and
limt→T h(t) → 1. Over a timescale T , therefore, the po-
tential deforms from the initial to the desired potential
energy surface, and the evolving minima can be tracked,
for example, by following the damped dynamics in this
potential via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.

In the present work we follow both these strategies,
and show how homotopic deformation facilitates loca-
tion of the global minimum in a model problem. Sim-
ilar (so–called “continuation”) homotopic methods have
frequently been employed in related situations, as for ex-
ample in ﬁnding roots of polynomial equations in several
variables [7] or in the mean–ﬁeld dynamics in attractor
neural–networks [8].

Diﬀerent global optimization methods frequently ﬁnd
optimal solutions by elimination, by seeking lower and
lower minima. Trapping in local minima—and escape
from these minima—is a major practical issue. A num-
ber of diﬀerent strategies have been suggested in order to
engineer escape from local minima. These include both
techniques to allow for large excursions in the phase space
by the use of temperature or similar auxiliary parameters
(such as simulated annealing [10] and its variants [11,12])
as well as methods that deform the potential energy sur-
face. The diﬀusion equation method [13] and the distance
scaling method [14] fall in this latter class. Other meth-
ods utilize both strategies, as for example the stochastic
tunneling method [15] where simulated annealing is per-
formed on a surface where the barriers are exponentially
reduced so as to facilitate escape from local minima, the
landscape paving technique [16], or the basin hopping
technique [17] which replaces the potential surface by a
set of piecewise ﬂat regions.

The present technique is in the class of optimization
methods that exploit potential surface deformation to
avoid trapping in local minima. The interpolation pa-
rameter α, or the switching functions h(t) smoothly con-
vert one PES into another. The intermediate potentials
are qualitatively not very diﬀerent from the asymptotic
potential in terms of the number of minima and maxima,
although the relative depths and curvatures are quite dif-
ferent. As we discuss below, this feature contributes to
eﬃciency of the present technique in locating minima.
The lowest energy achieved when an ensemble of suit-
ably compact initial conﬁgurations is evolved is taken as
the ground state prediction of this method.

Application: The problem of minimum energy con-
ﬁguration determination for N particle atomic clusters

is computationally hard, and the validity of a global so-
lution cannot, typically, be veriﬁed. Existing data for
global minima [19] are usually the “lowest minima as yet
located” in all but the simplest cases. A variety of global
optimization techniques have been applied to this prob-
lem [17,18] with diﬀering degrees of success.

For the most extensively studied such systems, namely
model rare–gas clusters, the potential energy surface
(PES) is an additive pairwise Lennard-Jones interaction,

(3)

where rij is the distance between particles i and j, and
ǫ, σ are the standard Lennard-Jones parameters. The po-
tential energy landscape varies greatly with cluster size.
Notable diﬃcult optimization problems in this regard
are, for example, 38, 75, or 98 atom clusters, where the
potential energy surface has the so–called multiple funnel
structure [20,21,22].

In the implementation of the MD approach we proceed
as follows. Vi is taken to be a pairwise sum of harmonic
terms V (rij ) = (rij − 21/6σ)2/2. We perform molecular
dynamics simulations [23] of the N particle system, with
an additional damping term for each particle,

m ¨~ri + γ ˙~ri +

∂V (t)
∂~ri

= 0, i = 1, . . . , N

(4)

where m is the mass of the particle and γ is the damping
coeﬃcient. The internal timescale of interparticle vibra-
tions depends on the parameters m, σ and ǫ. For a given
switching function h(t) (we have explored a variety of
such functions listed in Table I) the adiabatic time scale
is set by the parameter ζ; the entire system dynamics
thus has two external time scales ζ−1 and mγ−1. In the
limit γ → ∞, our procedure reduces to a steepest descent
minimization on the evolving potential. The dynamics of
the system is followed until a stationary conﬁguration is
reached.

In order to quantitatively assess the eﬃciency of this

procedure, we deﬁne the measure

Pg =

Number of ground state conﬁgurations
Total number of condensates

,

(5)

a condensate being a conﬁguration such that all atoms
are within a single cluster. This is clearly a function of γ
and ζ. For the ground state energy, comparison is made
to the existing benchmark calculations already available
for Lennard–Jones clusters [19].

N

j=1(~rj −~r0

j )2,
In the CG approach, Vi is taken to be β P
~r0
j being the (random) initial position for the jth atom.
This choice of Vi ensures that the initial conﬁguration is
the exact global minimum for the potential energy sur-
face, Eq. (1) with α = 0; β is a constant that tunes
the curvature of the PES. The parameter α is then var-
ied from 0 to 1 in Ns discrete steps; the result of the
CG minimization (we follow the standard method [6]) at

each step is taken to be the starting conﬁguration for the
CG minimization at the next value of α. In this latter
approach, therefore, the attempt is to allow the global
minimum itself to evolve homotopically.

Results: The present application is intended to be illus-
trative rather than exhaustive. We have systematically
studied diﬀerent cluster sizes up to N = 40 and in all
cases the calculated ground–state energy and conﬁgura-
tion matches existing results exactly. This includes the
diﬃcult case of the 38-atom cluster which is an interest-
ing and important test for any optimization method [20].
The number of minima increases exponentially with clus-
ter size [24]; for LJ7 there are 4 minima, while for LJ55
the number exceeds 1010 [2]. Detailed results, which clar-
ify some aspects of the present technique are presented
for the cases of N =19,22 (MD) and N =38 (CG).

In the MD version of the present technique, in the ab-
sence of switching, namely in the sudden limit V (t) = Vf ,
the system quickly settles into the nearest available mini-
mum based on the level of damping introduced. By start-
ing from an ensemble of initial conditions, a variety of dif-
ferent minima are reached but the probability of ﬁnding
the true ground state is essentially zero for large clusters.
With an adiabatic switch [9], the results are dramatically
diﬀerent. The continuous evolution of the potential en-
ergy landscape is a key factor in permitting escape from
local minima. Only asymptotically does the system come
to rest, but until then, there is always residual kinetic
energy due to which the system avoids being trapped by
small barriers. Shown in Fig. 1 is the typical variation of
potential energy (in units of ǫ), which is nonmonotonic
once the adiabatic switching is incorporated. Regardless
of the actual form of the switching, more than 85% of all
initially random conﬁgurations condense, except in the
case where the switching is applied to the repulsive term
of the potential. Representative data is given in Table I.
As emphasized, the adiabatic optimization proposed
here is heuristic. The optimal choice for the parameters
γ, ζ for a given cluster size depend on a number of fea-
tures such as the interaction potential parameters and the
inherent time-scales. By scanning over reasonable values
of the parameters, it is possible to determine regions in
parameter space with a higher than average probability
of reaching the ground state. It also appears that adi-
abaticity is crucial since the probability of reaching the
ground state increases substantially with decreasing ζ:
Pg is shown versus ζ for the 19–atom case in Fig. 2.

In the CG method of following minima during homo-
topy, the probability of reaching the global minimum is
enhanced through the modiﬁcation of the PES curvature.
Since Vi adds a uniform positive curvature at the interme-
diate stages it eﬀectively suppresses or eliminates many
barrier. To perform some benchmarking of the advan-
tage this gives, we present, in Table II, data pertaining
to ﬁnding the global minimum for LJ38 comparing the
present method and the basin-hopping technique. The
three lowest minima are at energies -173.928, -173.252
and -173.134 respectively. In either method, all particles

tation of the basin-hopping algorithm, coordinate dis-
placements are random in the interval [-0.3,0.3] and the
temperature is taken to be 2. An overall conﬁning poten-

tial of the form Vc = Pi exp(20(ri − a)), a = 1 + ( N
was added to prevent dissociation, and a standard Polak–
Ribiere algorithm was used for the conjugate–gradient
minimization [6] with tolerance set between 10−5 and
10−7. The average computational eﬀort required is a
product of the number of trials needed in order to get to
the ground state on average and the number of function
and derivative calls per trial. In our implementation of
the algorithms, we ﬁnd that the reduction in computa-
tional eﬀort in locating the global minimum through the
homotopy method is about 40%. The relative eﬃciencies
can, however, vary depending on the actual choice of the
various adjustable parameters in the two techniques. In
either the MD or the CG version, conﬁgurations that do
not reach the global minimum still typically tend to ﬁnd
the lowest energy states, so that a by-product of this
methodology is a considerably detailed map of the low
excitation regime of the cluster. This feature, however,
is not unique to the present method.

Summary: We have presented here a method for global
optimization which relies on the guided evolution of the
underlying landscape. The methodology for ﬁnding min-
ima on this surface can vary, and in the examples pre-
sented here, we have used both the conjugate gradient
technique as well as damped molecular dynamics. (Dy-
namics in the landscape has been incorporated in other
techniques, for example in genetic algorithms [25].) As in
other methods, apart from the global minimum, we also
obtain a detailed picture of the excitation spectrum.

Within the context of cluster geometry determination
itself, several issues need to be addressed. The adia-
batic method can be shown to locate ground states even
when there are bifurcations along the deformation path-
way [26]. Is it possible to design more eﬃcient homotopic
deformations? What is the role of Vi in controlling the
eﬃciency?

The application here, though in some ways a model
problem, has all the complications that arise in more gen-
eral optimization problems. The success of this simple
technique is therefore encouraging.

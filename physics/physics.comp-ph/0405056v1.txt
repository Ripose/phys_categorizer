We present a new Monte Carlo method which couples Path Integral for ﬁnite temperature protons
with Quantum Monte Carlo for ground state electrons, and we apply it to metallic hydrogen for
pressures beyond molecular dissociation. We report data for the equation of state for temperatures
across the melting of the proton crystal. Our data exhibit more structure and higher melting
temperatures of the proton crystal than Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics results. This method
ﬁlls the gap between high temperature electron-proton Path Integral and ground state Diﬀusion
Monte Carlo methods.

The knowledge of the physical properties of hydrogen
in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions is a key
problem in planetary and high pressure physics[1, 2]. In
the search for the metallization transition three diﬀer-
ent insulating molecular crystal phases have been clearly
observed so far in diamond anvil cell experiments up to
3.2Mbar[3] at room temperature and below. Metalliza-
tion has been obtained in shock wave experiments for a
warm dense molecular liquid[4] but properties at ﬁnite
temperature and/or at higher pressure are largely un-
known because experiments are increasingly diﬃcult.

A large body of theoretical investigations of high pres-
sure hydrogen have appeared over the years[5]. They
helped the understanding of the experimental observa-
tions and hold out the prospect of predicting the room
temperature metallization pressure and the phase dia-
gram at higher pressure. However the present under-
standing of high pressure hydrogen is unsatisfactory be-
cause 1) energy diﬀerences among diﬀerent crystalline
phases are small requiring a very accurate total energy
method to determine the stable crystalline phase and lo-
cate transition lines; 2) size eﬀects are large in metallic
and quasi-metallic systems and Brillouin zone sampling
is extremely important for accurate total energy calcula-
tions; 3) proton quantum eﬀects are important and can
inﬂuence the energetic ordering of crystal phases ; 4) an
accurate theoretical prediction of metallization may re-
quire accuracy beyond that of the LDA+GGA Density
Functional Theory [6, 7].

Here we describe a method based on Quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) calculation of the electronic energy for
quantum mechanical protons able to sample eﬃciently
the protonic conﬁgurational space and spontaneously
ﬁnd the stable phase of the system within the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation. Previous QMC studies
of hydrogen at T = 0 have treated electrons and pro-
tons at the same level of description and become in-
eﬃcient in following the evolution of particles of very
dissimilar mass (mp/me = 1836). Moreover, the inter-
esting eﬀects of temperature are absent in this proce-
dure. Nonetheless, they have established that pressure
dissociation of hydrogen molecules at T=0K occurs at

rs = [3/(4π ne)]1/3 = 1.31 (P ∼ 3M bars)[8], where
ne is the electronic number density. Upon dissociation
the molecular crystal transforms to a proton lattice of
diamond structure and later to a lattice of cubic sym-
metry (bcc) at P ≥ 8M bars[9, 10]. At ﬁnite tempera-
ture Restricted Path Integral Monte Carlo (RPIMC)[11]
has been used to predict the equation of state (EOS)
and to investigate the occurrence of the plasma phase
transition[12].
In RPIMC, both electrons and protons
are at ﬁnite temperature but it is eﬃcient only for tem-
peratures above 1/20 of the electronic Fermi tempera-
ture (roughly 3 × 104K at rs = 1). The new method
described here, called Coupled Electronic-Ionic Monte
Carlo (CEIMC)[13, 14], is able to ﬁll the gap between
the RPIMC and the ground state QMC methods. We
study metallic hydrogen in a range of densities and tem-
peratures where molecules are absent and where protons
undergo a solid-ﬂuid transition. We report results for the
EOS and give a qualitative location of the transition line.
In the CEIMC method the proton degrees of freedom
are advanced by a Metropolis algorithm in which the en-
ergy diﬀerence between the actual state S and the trial
state S′ is computed by a Quantum Monte Carlo calcu-
lation (either variational (VMC) or reptation (RQMC)
[15]). The energy diﬀerence is aﬀected by statistical
noise which would bias the MC sampling. Unbiased sam-
pling of the proton conﬁgurations can be achieved by the
penalty method[16], a generalization of the Metropolis
algorithm.

We sample the electronic degrees of freedom according
to the sum of the electronic distribution functions (e. g.
the square of the trial wave function in VMC) for the S
and S′ states, and we compute the energies for the two
states as correlated sampling averages[13, 14], thereby re-
ducing the noise. Analytic trial wave functions including
backﬂow and three-body correlation[17] have been used
in most of our calculations. These functions are particu-
larly appropriate to our methods since: 1) they are quite
accurate; 2) they are free of adjustable parameters so do
not require optimization; 3) their computational cost is
much less then solving the Kohn-Sham equations as was
done in previous QMC calculations[9, 10], in particular

for a random arrangement of several tens of protons.

To go beyond VMC, we implemented a Reptation
Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm (RQMC)[15] to sample
more accurately the electronic ground state. Similar to
Diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC), RQMC projects the trial
wavefunction to the ground state within the Fixed-Node
approximation. The high quality of our trial wave func-
tions makes it possible to relax to the ground state with
a very limited number of time slices. In RQMC the elec-
tronic path space is sampled by a reptation algorithm in
which, at each step, a new link is added to one end of the
path and an existing link is deleted from the other end,
subject to a “Metropolis” acceptance/rejection step. To
speed up convergence we have introduced the “bounce”
algorithm in which the growth direction is reversed only
when a move is rejected[18]. RQMC is particularly suited
for computing energy diﬀerences.

To reduce ﬁnite size eﬀects in metallic systems, we av-
erage over twisted boundary conditions (TABC) when
computing electronic energies (i.e. we integrate over the
Brillouin zone of the super cell)[14, 19]. All properties
are averaged over 1000 diﬀerent k-points. For the typical
protonic displacement, we compute the energy diﬀerence
over 100 electronic steps/k-point. After averaging over
k-points, the noise level is small enough to simulate tem-
peratures as low as 100K[14].

We represent protons by imaginary time path integrals
without considering the statistics of the protons. (those
eﬀects are negligible in this temperature-density range.)
For eﬃciency, it is important to minimize the number of
protonic time slices. We have used the pair action of an
eﬀective proton-proton potential and treated the diﬀer-
ence between the true Born-Oppenheimer energy and the
eﬀective potential with the primitive approximation[20].
With this action, we ﬁnd that a proton imaginary time
step τp = 0.3 × 10−3K −1 is appropriate for rs ≥ 1 so
that few tens of time slices allow for calculations above
100K. When coupled with TABC, we can, at each pro-
ton move, randomly assign a subset of k-points to each
protonic slice without introducing a detectable system-
atic eﬀect. This strategy allows one to simulate quan-
tum protons at essentially the same computational cost
as classical protons, except for the slower relaxation of
the protonic paths.

In order to assess the accuracy of the CEIMC method
we ﬁrst consider a system of Np = Ne = 16 at
rs = 1 and T=5000K and compare with RPIMC.
The CEIMC-RQMC calculation, performed with τe =
0.0125H −1, βe = 0.5H −1 (41 electronic time slices), pro-
vides a total energy lower than the VMC estimate by
4(2)mH/atom = 1260(630)K.However, the VMC and
RQMC pressures agree within error bars. Comparison
between VMC and RQMC pair correlation functions is
also very good (see ﬁgure 1). The VMC and RQMC
gep(r)’s are superimposed except at distance below 0.2a0
(a0 = 0.529˚A is the Bohr radius), due to time step er-

“low” temperatures (the Fermi temperature at rs = 1
is 1.84H = 5.8 105K) can be reached only by impos-
ing less realistic ground state nodal restriction[11, 14].
RPIMC data, obtained with free particle nodes and
1000 time slices, agrees with CEIMC ones. CEIMC
computed gep(r) exhibits slightly more structure than
RPIMC, and since thermal eﬀects on the electrons should
be largely negligible in such conditions, we attribute the
observed diﬀerence to the more accurate nodal structure
of CEIMC compared to RPIMC.

Next we compare with Car-Parrinello Molecular Dy-
namics (CPMD) simulation[21] which uses the LDA com-
puted forces. Figure 2 shows that CEIMC-VMC gpp(r)’s
for classical protons exhibit considerably more structure
than does LDA. CPMD simulations considered systems
of classical protons with a closed shell (in reciprocal
space), and only the Γ point. We compare with two dif-
ferent CEIMC calculations for classical protons, namely
an open shell system (Np = 32) with the TABC, and a
closed shell system (Np = 54) with the Γ point only. For
the latter case, we ﬁnd that the gpp(r) from VMC and
RQMC (not shown) agree; but they exhibit more struc-
ture than CPMD. The TABC one is in the liquid state,
while the simulation using only the Γ point,
initially
prepared in a liquid state from temperature quenching,
exhibits the onset of spontaneous crystallization. The
larger correlation in CEIMC with respect to CPMD is
compatible with our early estimate of the melting tem-
perature of the fcc crystal of classical proton between
1000K and 1500K [14] at variance with the the LDA esti-
mate of 350K (for the bcc crystal)[21]. The observed dis-
crepancy between CEIMC and CPMD is surprising since
LDA is generally believed to be accurate at high density.
However a previous study of hydrogen at rs = 1.31[9]
reported that diﬀerences in energy among several crys-

VMC-TABC at T=2000K (stars) are also reported.

tal structures obtained within LDA are smaller than en-
ergy diﬀerences from Diﬀusion MC by roughly a factor of
two. Also zero point energies in QMC were roughly twice
the LDA estimates (from the harmonic approximation).
This suggests that the Born-Oppenheimer surface from
LDA is ﬂatter than the more accurate one from QMC.
Moreover there is a known issue in computing the ionic
temperature in CPMD; the simple estimate based on the
ionic kinetic energy provides only a lower bound for the
true temperature[22]. Tracing the origin of the observed
discrepancy between CEIMC and CPMD results would
deserve an independent study. Here we just note that
better agreement is observed between CPMD results at
temperature T and CEIMC data at temperature 2T for
300 ≤ T ≤ 3000, see for instance ﬁgure 2.

RQMC is roughly an order of magnitude more expen-
sive than VMC. Therefore, it is important to establish
the accuracy of VMC before performing a systematic
study of the equation of state.
In table I we compare
VMC and RQMC at T = 5000K and rs = 1.2, the low-
est density we have considered. Calculations are done at
the Γ point and a projection time of βe = 0.68H −1 for
RQMC. We have checked that for protons in bcc lattice,
the energy has converged to its ground state value for
β ∼ 0.6. We ﬁnd that the VMC energy is systematically
higher by roughly 7.6(2)mH/at = 2400(60)K,while the
VMC pressure is systematically lower by 0.03(1)M bars.
The error on the energy is expected to be independent
of the temperature and to decrease with increasing den-
sity. Even though the amount of energy missing in VMC
is quite large on the proton energy scale, we only ob-
serve a minor eﬀect on gpp(r); energy diﬀerences are
quite accurate within VMC. On the basis of the above
results, we performed a systematic study of the Equa-
tion of State (EOS) using VMC. In table II we report

total, kinetic and potential energies, pressure, the Lin-
demann ratio for bcc crystal, and the proton kinetic en-
ergy. The latter quantity can be compared to 3KBT /2
(last column). The zero point proton motion aﬀects not
only the proton kinetic energy but also increases the elec-
tronic kinetic energy and, to a smaller extent, the con-
ﬁgurational energy. At rs = 1 and T = 500K we ﬁnd
a total energy increase of 14.9(2)mH/at = 4670(60)K of
which 2020(30)K comes from the proton kinetic energy,
2200(20)K the electronic kinetic energy, and 450(10)K
the conﬁgurational energy. Residual ﬁnite size eﬀects
have been estimated from static lattice calculation at
rs = 1 to be of the order of 10mH/at on the energy,
and 0.21 M bars on the pressure. The transition line, esti-
mated by the dynamical observation of melting, is located
between 1000K and 2000K at rs = 0.8, between 500K
and 1000K at rs = 1.0 and close to 1000K at rs = 1.2.
Indeed at the latter density and at T=1000K the system
is able to sustain both liquid and crystal states for the
entire length of our simulations (80000 protonic steps).

In conclusion we have developed a new and eﬃcient
Quantum Monte Carlo Method to study low temperature
quantum protons and ground state electrons which is a
major improvement over previous QMC and DFT-LDA
based methods. It allows for simulations of many-body
hydrogen using QMC for the electronic energies. We have
developed eﬃcient procedures to include protonic path
integrals and k-point sampling. We have applied it to
metallic hydrogen beyond molecular dissociation and in-
vestigated the solid-ﬂuid transition of the protons. The
present methodology can be extended in several ways.
Constant pressure algorithm would be useful to study
structural phase transitions. However for metallic sys-
tems, we have found that level crossings, arising from
changes in the shape of the simulation box, considerably
increase the noise level and makes our correlated sam-
pling procedure ineﬃcient. The method can be easily
extended to the insulating molecular phase by replac-
ing the metallic trial functions with localized molecular
orbitals[13, 14]. A study of the melting line of molecu-
lar hydrogen is in progress. Consideration of the metal-
insulator transition requires a trial function that goes
smoothly from metallic to localized orbitals. We are in-
vestigating an accurate and eﬃcient form for this. Ex-
tension of the present method to more complex elements

For many biological applications of molecular dynamics (MD) the importance of good sampling in
conformational space makes it necessary to eliminate the fastest motions from the system in order to
increase the time step. An accurate knowledge of these motions is a necessary prerequisite for such
eﬀorts. It is known that harmonic vibrations of bond lengths and bond angles produce the highest
frequencies in proteins. There are also fast anharmonic motions, such as inter-atomic collisions,
which are probably most important when bond lengths and bond angles are ﬁxed. However, the
speciﬁc time scales corresponding to all these limitations are not known precisely. In order to clarify
the above issue this paper analyses time step limiting factors in a series of numerical tests by using
an internal coordinate molecular dynamics approach, which allows chosen internal coordinates to
be frozen. It is found that, in proteins, there is a rather complicated hierarchy of fast motions,
with both harmonic and anharmonic eﬀects mixed together at several close time scales. Non-
bonded interactions, notably strong hydrogen bonding, create locally distributed normal modes
with frequencies similar to those of bond stretching between non-hydrogen atoms. They also impose
ubiquitous anharmonic limitations starting from rather small step sizes. With ﬁxed standard amino
acid geometry, rotations of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups limit time steps at the 5 fsec level. The
next important limitation occurs around 10 fsec and is created by collisions between non-hydrogen
atoms.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the literature devoted to protein dynamics two
classes of motions are most frequently discussed. The
ﬁrst comprises the slowest motions involved in the fold-
ing and various biological functions of proteins. The
second class is at the opposite border of the spectrum
and includes the fastest motions which limit time steps
in molecular dynamics (MD) calculations and, conse-
quently, the time scales accessible for simulation. Be-
cause of the high computer cost of long MD trajectories
for biological systems, considerable eﬀorts have always
been applied to overcome these limitations. The ﬁrst and
most popular method is constraint MD1,2,3. Among the
techniques developed in recent years one can mention,
for example, multiple time scale MD4,5, weighted mass
MD6,7 and internal coordinate MD (ICMD)8,9,10,11,12.
Within the framework of this research the physical na-
ture and the speciﬁc time scales of the fast motions in
proteins have often been discussed13. There are several
reasons, however, why this issue required the more com-
plete analysis presented here.

One of the motivations came from recent progress in
ICMD, that is dynamics simulations in the space of in-
ternal rather than Cartesian coordinates14,15. By this
method, proteins can be modeled as chains of rigid bod-
ies with only torsional degrees of freedom. It is not ob-
vious a priori what are the time step limiting motions
in such models, and, in the literature, there are rather
contradictory estimates of the overall prospects of ICMD
compared to constraint MD16,17. Another reason why
this question attracts attention came from the recent

results concerning the properties of the numerical algo-
rithms commonly employed in MD, namely integrators of
the St¨ormer-Verlet-leapfrog group18. It has been found
that the ﬂuctuation of the computed instantaneous to-
tal energy of a microcanonical ensemble, which is gener-
ally used as the most important test for quality of MD
trajectories, is dominated by simple interpolation errors
and cannot serve as a measure of accuracy. It is possible,
therefore, that previous estimates of limiting step sizes
were signiﬁcantly biased.

Proteins have hierarchical spatial organization and this
structural hierarchy is naturally mapped onto the spec-
trum of their motions. Namely, fast motions involve in-
dividual atoms and chemical groups while the slow ones
correspond to displacements of secondary structures, do-
mains etc. Every such movement considered separately
can be characterized by a certain maximum time step,
and in this sense one can say that there exists a hierar-
chy of fast motions and, accordingly, of step size limits.
The lowest such limit is determined by bond stretching
vibrations of hydrogens, but for our purposes the fol-
lowing few levels of this hierarchy are most interesting.
Normally it is assumed that stretching of bonds between
non-hydrogen atoms forms the next level19. However,
this intuitive suggestion is not easy to verify because pro-
tein normal modes in this frequency range are not always
local, and their high frequencies cannot be readily at-
tributed to speciﬁc harmonic terms in the force ﬁeld. On
the other hand, normal modes with bond lengths con-
strained have never been studied. It should also be ex-
pected that, because of the limitations imposed by fast
anharmonic motions, the hierarchy does not exactly cor-

1

respond to the spectra of normal modes. All these issues
are considered in detail below.

The paper is organized as a simple sequence of numer-
ical tests on a model protein with the fastest motions
suppressed one after another. Step size limits are de-
termined by a unique test proposed and analyzed in de-
tail elsewhere18.
It is found that the hierarchy of step
size limits is rather complicated and does not always fol-
low common intuitive assumptions. For instance, bond
stretching between non-hydrogen atoms in fact overlaps
the frequency range of certain collective vibrations and,
therefore, does not create a separate limitation on time
steps. On the other hand, with step sizes beyond 10 fsec,
anharmonic eﬀects become dominant. In agreement with
recent studies18, leapfrog trajectories appear to hold to
correct constant-energy hypersurfaces with considerably
larger time steps than commonly recommended.

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Test Systems and Simulation Protocols

The main model system consists of an immunoglobulin
binding domain of streptococcal protein G20 which is a
56 residue α/β protein subunit (ﬁle 1pgb in the Protein
Database21) with 24 bound water molecules available in
the crystal structure. All hydrogens are considered ex-
plicitly giving a total of 927 atoms. In order to separate
eﬀects produced by water from those due to the protein
itself similar tests were also performed for a droplet of
TIP3P water molecules. The initial conﬁguration of the
droplet was obtained by taking the coordinates of the
ﬁrst 100 molecules closest to the center of the standard
water box supplied with the AMBER package22,23. Equi-
libration for low temperature tests was performed start-
ing from the local energy minimum corresponding to this
conﬁguration rather than from an ice crystal structure.
In all calculations the AMBER94 force ﬁeld was
employed24 without truncation of non-bonded interac-
tions. Molecular motions were generally simulated with
internal coordinates as independent variables by using
Hamiltonian equations of motion and an implicit leapfrog
integrator described elsewhere15. In one case, however,
namely for normal temperature calculations with ﬁxed
bond lengths to hydrogen atoms, the standard AMBER
package was employed, because the ICMD algorithm
needs too many iterations for convergence with large
step sizes15. Comparisons between ICMD trajectories
and usual Cartesian MD show no essential diﬀerences15,
therefore, for consistency and convenience, internal coor-
dinates have been preferred wherever possible.

Initial data for all numerical tests were prepared with
the standard protocol described earlier15,18 which makes
possible smooth initialization of leapfrog trajectories al-
ways from a single constant energy hypersurface. In or-
der to simulate a virtually harmonic behavior parallel

tests were performed at the very low temperature of 1K
for which the equilibration protocol was modiﬁed as fol-
lows. During the ﬁrst 5 psec all velocities were reas-
signed several times by sampling from a Maxwell distri-
bution with T=1 K. During the following 7.5 psec ve-
locities were rescaled periodically if the average temper-
ature went above 2 K. This modiﬁcation was necessary
since in the virtually harmonic low temperature condi-
tions energy equipartition is reached very slowly and the
initial distribution over normal modes can persist for a
long time. The necessary harmonic frequencies were ob-
tained from calculated spectral densities of autocorrela-
tion functions of appropriate generalized velocities. In all
production runs the duration of the test trajectory was
10 psec.

The estimates of maximal time steps are normally
made by checking conservation of the total energy of a mi-
crocanonical ensemble25,26. Our approach is similar, but
it accurately takes into account certain non-trivial prop-
erties of the leapfrog discretization of MD trajectories18.
The test trajectory is repeatedly calculated always start-
ing from the same constant-energy hypersurface. In each
run certain system averages are evaluated and compared
with “ideal” values, i.e. the same parameters obtained
with a very small time step. The choice of such pa-
rameters must correspond to the leapfrog discretization,
which means that they should be computed from on-step
coordinates and half-step velocities without additional
interpolations. The latter condition, together with the
“smooth start”, distinguishes this approach from ear-
lier testing strategies. These modiﬁcations are essential
because they remove a signiﬁcant and systematic bias
present in the traditional approach which employs the
time ﬂuctuation of the instantaneous total energy as an
indicator of accuracy18.

The parameters we use are as follows: the average po-
tential energy, ¯U , and its time variance, D[U ]; the aver-
age kinetic energy, ¯K, computed for half-steps; the total
energy, E = ¯U + ¯K, and its drift computed in the same
way, referred to below as E-drift. For a suﬃciently long
trajectory of a Hamiltonian system ¯U , E and D[U ] char-
acterize the sampled hypersurface in phase space. Their
deviations from the corresponding virtually ideal values
characterize the bias of the sampling obtained and, there-
fore, can be used for accessing step size limits. The E-
drift computed in this way is exactly zero for ideal har-
monic systems18, and is thus a good indicator of anhar-
monic eﬀects.

As an example let us consider results of such testing
for a completely free protein. It is seen in Fig. 1 that,
below a step size of about 1.7 fsec, all the measured pa-
rameters remain approximately constant and close to the
accurate values. Above this level some deviations grow
rapidly. This characteristic behavior is similar to that of
a simple leapfrog harmonic oscillator18,27. All its prop-
erties depend upon the reduced step size τ = ωh, where
ω is the frequency, and it can be shown analytically that,
with small τ , power series expansions for deviations of E

2

and ¯U are dominated by the terms of the fourth and sixth
orders18. This explains why the deviations grow rapidly
beyond a certain threshold which depends mainly upon
the highest frequencies in the system.

FIG. 1. Characteristic time step dependencies obtained for
a completely free protein. The corresponding low temperature
plots are shown by thinner lines in (a-c). For comparison, in
(a) and (c) the low temperature deviations for the total and
potential energies had been scaled and shifted to ﬁt the range
of deviations observed with normal temperature. The dashed
horizontal lines in (a) and (c) show the bands of acceptable
deviation corresponding to variances D[U ] indicated by the
dashed line in (d). The deﬁnition of these bands is given in
the text.

In order to access the accuracy quantitatively we need
to compare the deviations of average energies with some
scale. An appropriate natural scale is given by the time
variations of the potential energy characterized by the
value of D[U ] shown in Fig. 1 (d). We will take a devi-
ation of 0.1D[U ] as the upper acceptable level for ¯U and
a two times larger value for E. In a harmonic system, ¯U
and ¯K computed as described are equal18; so the devia-
tion of E is exactly two times that of ¯U and it reaches
its upper level simultaneously with ¯U , i.e. with the same
characteristic step size denoted as hc. The threshold lev-
els chosen are certainly arbitrary, but they are reasonable
and normally hc values appear similar to maximal step
sizes reported in the literature. We note, however, that
we will be mainly interested here in relative rather than
in absolute hc values for diﬀerent models.

Thus, the dotted line in Fig. 1 (d) marks the best
estimate of the variance D[U ] and similar lines in Figs.
1 (a,c) show the corresponding acceptance intervals for
energies. It can be seen in Figs. 1 (a) and (c) that, at
normal temperature, the deviations of the total and po-
tential energies look qualitatively diﬀerent because ¯U is
aﬀected by occasional transitions between local minima

which are stochastic and cannot be properly averaged
during the relatively short test trajectory. Nevertheless,
both ¯U and E go beyond their acceptance intervals with
hc ≈ 1.7 fsec. At low temperature, both deviations are
regular, and they yield almost exactly the same hc value.
The highest frequencies in this system are those of the
bond stretching modes of hydrogens and they range from
approximately 3000 cm−1 for aliphatic groups to 3800
cm−1 for the fastest hydroxyl groups24,28,29. It appears,
therefore, that our hc value corresponds to τ ≈ 1.1 in
reasonable agreement with an ideal harmonic model18.
For a frequency of 3800 cm−1 the stability limit of the
leapfrog scheme is h = 2.78 fsec27, and in low tempera-
ture tests the numerical trajectory remains stable right
up to this value. At normal temperature, however, a sig-
niﬁcant E-drift appears with h > 2 fsec, which indicates
that some fast anharmonic motions occur in the system,
and the test trajectory could not be completed because
of an explosive growth in temperature. The high E-drift
can be caused, for instance, by collisions between hydro-
gens in non-polar contacts.

Since the data presented in Fig. 1 are redundant each
case below is characterized by plots (a) and (b) alone.
The deviation of the total energy is suﬃcient to evaluate
hc, while ¯U always behaves similarly to plot (c). As for
the value of D[U ] shown in Fig. 1 (d), its large and
systematic deviation always results from the drift of the
potential energy which is implicitly included in plot (b).

- only bonds to hydrogen atoms ﬁxed; (c,d) - all bond lengths

Proteins with Constrained Bond Lengths

The two standard modes of constraining bond lengths,
that is, constraining only bonds to hydrogens and con-
straining all bonds, yield the results shown in Fig. 2.

3

We see that they exhibit rather similar behavior with hc
values around 3 fsec for both low and normal tempera-
ture simulations. In proteins, the fastest bond stretching
modes between non-hydrogen atoms normally occur in
carboxyl groups, with frequencies around 1720 cm−1 29.
In our calculations, however, the fastest mode was found
at 1850 cm−1 a tryptophan side chain, which, in a har-
monic case, would give a maximum step size of 5.7 fsec
and hc ≈ 3. We note, therefore, that the plots in Figs. 2
(a,b) agree well with a harmonic approximation and give
the expected hc value with only bonds to hydrogens con-
strained. With all bonds constrained, however, the ori-
gin of the limitation is not clear. The fastest bond angle
bending modes are around 1600 cm−1 29, i.e. not so far,
but still they should not impose limitations in this range
of time steps. These limitations are evidently harmonic,
however, because in low temperature tests (see Figs. 2
(a) and (c)) the two models behave almost identically.
Note that they both almost reach the harmonic step size
limit, with E-drift close to zero, while the hc values are
roughly the same as those at normal temperature.

FIG. 3. Spectral densities of velocity autocorrelation func-
tions for H–Nǫ–H bond angle of Lys13 for low tempera-
ture MD trajectories calculated with only bonds to hydrogen
atoms ﬁxed (a), and with all bond lengths ﬁxed (b). The
spectra had been computed from separate 40 psec runs with
1 fsec time step and all points stored. The densities are given
in arbitrary scales.

An explanation to this apparently counter-intuitive be-
havior follows from the example shown in Fig. 3. This
ﬁgure presents spectral densities of bond bending oscil-
lations of one of the H–Nǫ–H angles of Lys13 obtained
at low temperature with the two diﬀerent modes of ap-
plying bond length constraints. We see that, with ﬁxed
bonds to hydrogen atoms only, the maximum occurs at
1780 cm−1, not very far from the fastest bond stretch-

4

ing. These two hydrogens are involved in hydrogen bonds
with the peptide oxygen of Gly9 and a water molecule,
respectively. Neither this angle, nor any of the adjacent
bonds or bond angles have independent frequencies above
1700 cm−1, nevertheless, the signal at 1780 cm−1 is ob-
served in the spectral densities of many valence and dihe-
dral angles between neighboring atoms, as well as within
the hydrogen bonded Gly9, indicating that this frequency
corresponds to a locally distributed normal mode.

With all bond lengths ﬁxed, this normal mode can-
not remain intact, but it does not disappear, which is
clear from Fig. 3 (b). Compared with Fig. 3 (a) there
are many fewer signals above 1500 cm−1, but one at
1690 cm−1 has appeared. This peak apparently corre-
sponds to the same fast collective mode as in Fig. 3 (a),
with bond stretching eliminated, and, as we see, its fre-
quency is just slightly reduced. Such behavior is rather
characteristic of bond angle vibrations of hydrogens in-
volved in hydrogen bonding, which explains similar step
size limitations for the two modes of bond length con-
straint. A high frequency in this case results from a
combination of several terms in the force ﬁeld, rather
from a single speciﬁc one, with hydrogen bonding as one
of the major components. Bond length constraints aﬀect
such modes indirectly, mainly due to redistribution the
system inertia. We note ﬁnally that this particular exam-
ple had been selected because in both constraint modes
there is only one peak above 1650 cm−1, therefore, in the
spectrum shown in Fig. 3 (a), it cannot be attributed to
bond stretching. The largest independent shifts due to
hydrogen bonding are observed in valence angle vibra-
tions of hydroxyl groups and their frequencies also reach
the level of 1700 cm−1.

Water Droplet

The results of tests with a droplet of TIP3P water
molecules are shown in Figs. 4 (a,b). They exhibit an
hc value of 5 fsec, although one should note that beyond
6 fsec, with normal temperature, the E-drift grows very
rapidly. It might be expected that, since in this case no
purely harmonic terms are present in the force ﬁled, the
limiting motion should be anharmonic. The low temper-
ature tests, however, yield exactly the same hc value and,
thus, it appears that the system behaves rather similarly
to the previous ones with a time step limiting frequency
of approximately 1100 cm−1. This value is close to the
experimental upper boundary of the band attributed to
the rotations of individual water molecules30.

Rotation, or rather libration, of a single water molecule
in a net of hydrogen bonds is certainly the fastest motion
here and it can be speciﬁcally slowed down by artiﬁcially
increasing the moments of inertia of the water molecule.
Such water models present considerable interest for sim-
ulations where structural and thermodynamic properties
are targeted, rather than kinetic ones6. Figures 4 (c,d)

demonstrate results of such tests with an inertia Iij = µδij
added to oxygen atoms, where δij is Kronecker delta and
µ = 4 (atom mass units)·˚A2. This means that oxygens
are no longer considered as point masses but as spherical
rigid bodies of the same mass. With µ = 4 the highest
frequency is expected to be reduced approximately by a
factor of two, and it is seen that plots in Figs. 4 (c,d)
look like those in Figs. 4 (a,b) scaled along the hori-
zontal axis, leading to a twofold increase in hc. Further
increase of inertia gives the eﬀect shown in Fig. 4 (e,f)
where µ equals 15. Instead of an increase proportional to
the square root of the added inertia we obtain hc around
14 fsec and 10 fsec for low and normal temperatures,
respectively. In this case, therefore, we encounter a qual-
itatively diﬀerent situation with signiﬁcantly anharmonic
limitations probably imposed by the translational motion
of water molecules and collisions between them.

FIG. 4. Water droplet tests. Results are shown for three
diﬀerent water models: (a,b) - standard TIP3P water model;
(c,d) - added inertia equaled 4; (e,f) added inertia equaled 15.
The notation is as in Figs. 1 (a,b).

By considering the results shown in Fig. 4 one con-
cludes that the water model with µ = 4 is “well bal-
anced” for normal temperature simulations in a sense
that both its translational and rotational movements oc-
cur in the same time scale and require similar time steps.
It is worth noting that the step size limits obtained here
with the new test agree well with earlier results.
It is
known, for instance, that, with a rigid water model, all
liquid structural properties are accurately reproduced up
to a step size of 6 fsec31. A similar assertion holds for
the “weighted mass” water model up to a step size of
10 fsec6.

Proteins with Fixed Standard Amino Acid
Geometry

In these calculations bond lengths and bond angles
in the protein were ﬁxed according to a standard ge-
ometry approximation32. The results shown in Figs.
5 (a,b) were obtained with no modiﬁcations of inertia
tensors. It is seen that they strongly resemble the water
droplet plots in Figs. 4 (a,b). This might mean that the
step size limitations are imposed by a few water clusters
around the protein, but calculations with increased wa-
ter inertia yield virtually identical results. On the other
hand, simultaneous weighting of water and protein hy-
droxyl groups yields a considerable eﬀect as shown in
Figs. 5 (c,d). The additional inertia tensor was same as
in the water droplet tests above. Thus, it is evident that,
in the standard geometry representation, libration of hy-
droxyl groups is the fastest motion, certainly due to their
small inertia. The high frequency of these librations is
due to hydrogen bonding rather than to the correspond-
ing torsional potential which produces oscillations with
at least three times lower frequencies.

FIG. 5. Calculations with constraints corresponding to the
standard amino acid geometry. (a,b) - with no modiﬁcations
of inertia tensors; (c,d) - with inertia of water molecules and
protein hydroxyl groups increased by 4; (e,f) - with inertia
tensors of water molecules and protein hydroxyl and amide
groups increased by 36, and masses of water oxygens equal to
72. The notation is as in Figs. 1 (a,b).

We saw above that a weighted water model with µ = 4
gives hc ≈ 10 fsec, and that this value already does not
depend upon the dynamics of hydrogen motion. It seems
that, in general, the 10 fsec level is characteristic of sys-
tems in which the time scale diﬀerence between the move-
ments of hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms is somehow
smoothed, which is illustrated by Figs. 5 (e,f). In these
calculations, in order to remove all the limitations im-

5

posed by water, the masses and inertia tensors of wa-
ter oxygens were increased by 56 and 36, respectively,
which gives a fourfold increase of both masses and iner-
tia tensors compared with Figs. 4 (c,d) and, accordingly,
a twofold increase in step sizes. The same inertia was
added to protein hydroxyl and amide groups. In the low
temperature plots in Figs. 5 (e,f), it is seen that the har-
monic hc is shifted compared to Fig. 5 (c), which means
that, in the previous model, librations of hydroxyl and
amide groups produce the highest frequencies. The eﬀect,
however, takes place at low temperature only, and the
characteristic time step in Fig. 5 (e) is approximately the
same as in Fig. 5 (c). A similar behavior is observed in
calculations with weighted inertia of other hydrogen-only
rigid bodies (results not shown). The situation, there-
fore, appears very similar to that in the water droplet
tests in Fig. 4, but in the present case fast collisions be-
tween non-hydrogen protein atoms present the limiting
factor. A possible way to overcome this limitation is the
RESPA approach5 which until now has been used only
within the context of Cartesian MD, but can be adapted
for ICMD with the Hamiltonian equations15 since they
make possible symplectic numerical integration.

III. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Although the problem of time step limitations in MD
simulations of biopolymers is long standing, and although
the search for eﬀective remedies has been the subject of
many studies, a precise account of the eﬀects that can
create such limitations was missing in the literature. It
is necessary to ﬁll this gap in order that eﬀorts put into
the development of new methods can be eﬀective.

The conventional view of this problem is that the step
size is limited by fast harmonic motions and that these
motions are produced by the stiﬀ components of empiri-
cal potentials connected with the deformations of bonds,
bond angles, planar groups etc. It has been shown here
that this description takes into account only a part of step
limiting factors. First, there may be many fast harmonic
vibrations in which hydrogen bonding plays a major role.
Second, non-bonded inter-atom interactions impose ubiq-
uitous anharmonic limitations starting from rather small
step sizes. All such factors form a complicated hierarchy
which slightly diﬀers between diﬀerent empirical poten-
tials and which is modiﬁed when constraints are imposed.
Our results suggest that the time steps currently used
in MD simulations can be increased considerably with no
serious loss in the accuracy of thermodynamic averages.
In unconstrained calculations with AMBER potentials
the estimated limit is about 1.7 fsec. Note, however,
that this value is mainly connected with the frequency
of OH-stretching which is high in AMBER because it
close to the upper limit of experimental frequencies of
free hydroxyl groups28. In the ENCAD potentials33, for
instance, the corresponding force constant is lowered by

a factor of 2, which is why a larger step size of 2 fsec
recommended by the authors is safe and could possibly
even be increased further.

Constraining bonds to hydrogen atoms removes the
lowest level in the hierarchy of fast motions and makes
possible time steps up to 3 fsec. Constraints on other
bond lengths, however, are eﬀective only together with
constraining bond angles. With ﬁxed standard amino
acid geometry, rotations of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl
groups limit time steps at a 5 fsec level. The next im-
portant limitation occurs around 10 fsec and it is due to
collisions between non-hydrogen protein atoms.

Boundary-integral method for poloidal
axisymmetric AC magnetic ﬁelds

J¯anis Priede and Gunter Gerbeth

Abstract— This paper presents a boundary-integral equation
(BIE) method for the calculation of poloidal axisymmetric mag-
netic ﬁelds applicable in a wide range of ac frequencies. The
method is based on the vector potential formulation and it
uses the Green’s functions of Laplace and Helmholtz equations
for the exterior and interior of conductors, respectively. The
work is particularly focused on a calculation of axisymmetric
Green’s function for the Helmholtz equation which is both
simpler and more accurate compared to previous approaches.
Three different approaches are used for calculation of the Green’s
function depending on the parameter range. For low and high
dimensionless ac frequencies we use a power series expansion
in terms of elliptical
integrals and an asymptotic series in
terms of modiﬁed Bessel functions of second kind, respectively.
For the intermediate frequency range, Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobatto
quadratures are used. The method is veriﬁed by comparing with
the analytical solution for a sphere in a uniform external ac ﬁeld.
The application of the method is demonstrated for a composite
model inductor containing an external secondary circuit.

I. INTRODUCTION

C ALCULATION of alternating magnetic ﬁelds and the

associated eddy currents is important for the design of
various electrical machines and the magnetic ﬁeld inductors
used for heating, melting, stirring, shaping or levitation of
metallic or semiconducting materials. Although the distri-
bution of electromagnetic ﬁelds is, in principle, completely
described by the Maxwell equations, only in very few simple
cases these equations can be solved analytically. Usually a
numerical approach is needed.

Most of the approaches used for the solution of electromag-
netic ﬁeld problems are based on ﬁnite difference (FDM) or
ﬁnite element methods (FEM). The main advantage of these
methods is their capability to deal with complex geometrical
conﬁgurations usually encountered in practical applications.
However, these methods involve a solution for the ﬁelds in
the free space which is often unbounded and,
thus, may
require considerable additional computer resources as well as
a special numerical treatment at the outer open boundary [1].

On the other hand, in many applications such as, for example,
electromagnetic heating and hardening of workpieces or the
stirring of molten metals, only the eddy currents and magnetic
ﬁelds in the conducting medium are needed. There are several
approaches avoiding the solution of the magnetic ﬁeld in the
free space. A ﬁrst kind of those approaches uses the Biot-
Savart law, to reduce the problem to a volume integral equation
[2], [3], [4]. A second type of approaches combine FEM for
the solution of the corresponding partial differential equation
(PDE) inside the conductor with a boundary element method
(BEM) based on the second Green’s theorem to represent
the ﬁeld in the free space as an integral of the ﬁeld values
and its gradient over the surface of the conductor [5], [6]. In
case of a thin skin-layer this approach reduces to a boundary
integral equation [7]. On the other hand, there are approaches
using the boundary impedance condition to approximate the
ﬁeld distribution in the conductor at small skin-depth in
combination with a FEM solution in the free space [8].

Our approach is to reduce the problem to a boundary
integral equation not only for the free space but also for the
interior of the conductor that would be applicable regardless
of the relative thickness of the skin-layer. This is possible
for a conductor with uniform electric and magnetic properties
when the ﬁeld distribution inside the conductor is described by
linear PDEs with constant coefﬁcients admitting an analytic
fundamental solution, i.e., the Green’s function. Advantage
of this approach is a consideration of the conductor surface
only. Thus,
the dimensionality of the problem is reduced
by one that renders this method particularly suited for the
analysis of complicated geometrical conﬁgurations. On the
other hand, this geometrical simpliﬁcation comes at the price
of an increased algebraic and numeric complexity due to
the calculation of the axisymmetric Green’s function. Similar
approaches have already been considered for 2D [9], [10] and
3D [11] problems which both are considerably algebraically
simpler than the axisymmetric problem considered here. There
is an analytic solution for the Green’s function for the 2D case
and a point-source Green’s function is used in the 3D case
while there is no simple analytic solution for Green’s function
in the axisymmetric case. The axisymmetric case has been
addressed by Fawzi et al. [19] who derived boundary integral
equations for the transverse magnetic (TM) mode in terms
of the azimuthal electrical and tangential magnetic ﬁelds in
the full electrodynamic formulation including the displacement
current. The same problem has been revisited in Refs. [20],
[21] in a quasi-static approximation. Our approach differs
from the previous ones by a more exact calculation of the

Green’s function using a combination of analytic, asymptotic
and numeric methods.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, problem
formulation and basic equations are given. The boundary-
integral equation derivation and the calculation of the Green’s
function for the azimuthal component of the vector potential
is presented in Section III. In Section IV, we describe the
numerical implementation of the method and give several
application examples. Finally, summary and conclusions are
given in Section V.

from that of Huang et al. [20] who uses a scalar counterpart of
the second Green identity which is not correct in general but
leads to the right result in the special case of an axisymmetric
and purely azimuthal vector potential which satisﬁes the
Coulomb gauge straightforwardly. To ﬁnd A′ at the point r
inside the volume enclosed by surface S we need the values
A′ on S. Usually both these values
of both A′ and n′
are unknown and two vector equations are needed to ﬁnd
them. The ﬁrst of the equations is obtained by approaching
the observation point r to the boundary S that results in:

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND BASIC EQUATIONS
Consider an axisymmetric body of a characteristic size R0
at rest having a uniform electrical conductivity σ placed in
an axisymmetric external ac magnetic ﬁeld with induction B
alternating harmonically in time with the angular frequency
ω. Searching for magnetic and electric ﬁelds in terms of
vector and scalar potentials as A (r, t) =
and
ℜ
, where A(r) and Φ(r) are generally
Φ(r)eiωt
Φ (r, t) =

leads to the governing
equation:

In Eq. (1) the gradient of the scalar potential ∇Φ plays the
role of a source term with respect to the vector potential. As it
will be shown later, this source term can be used to specify an
externally applied ac voltage to an axisymmetric coil system.
For the following it is advantageous to use the transformation

A = A′ + iω−

1∇Φ

that allows us to remove the source term from Eq. (1) by
including it into the vector potential. Then the equation for
A′ satisfying the Coulomb gauge ∇
A′ = 0 can be written
as

where λ2 = i¯ω with ¯ω = µ0σωR2
0 being the dimensionless
frequency. Henceforth all quantities and differential operators
are supposed to be nondimensionalized by using the corre-
sponding characteristic length and vector potential scales, R0
and A0, where the latter will be speciﬁed in the following for
each particular problem. The advantage of Eq. (3) compared
to its nonuniform counterpart (Eq. 1) is that the solution of the
former can straightforwardly be written as a surface integral
which is the aim of the next section.

where the sign difference at the second term is because of

Eq. (2): A′ = A

In the following we focus on the case of a purely az-
imuthal and axisymmetric vector potential A(r) = eϕA(r, z)
depending only on the radius r and the axial coordinate z in
a cylindrical system of coordinates. For the gradient of the
scalar potential ∇Φ to be purely azimuthal and axisymmetric,
Φ can be a function of the azimuthal angle ϕ only: Φ = Φ(ϕ).
Then ∇Φ = eϕ
∂ϕ = Φ0 = const because of
the axisymmetry. Further note that for axisymmetric bodies
with simply connected shapes including the symmetry axis,
Φ0 must be zero for ∇Φ to be limited at the symmetry axis
r = 0. However, Φ0 may be nonzero for toroidal bodies which
are not intersected by the symmetry axis. For such bodies, like
coils, Φ0 may be used to specify the externally applied voltage
U driving the current as ∂Φ
∂ϕ = U
2π . Alternatively, Φ0 may be
determined in the course of solution when the total current
rather than the voltage is speciﬁed on the coil. Note that our
treatment of the source term is more mathematically rigorous
compared to Ref. [20].

Substituting such a purely azimuthal vector potential into
Eq. (6) and performing the integration along the azimuthal
angle ϕ we obtain after some transformations an equation

There is an additional range of parameters where the power
series solution given by Eq. (11) is not applicable because
is large, while the asymptotic approximation (13) does not
κ

work because k is small and the exponential function under
the integral (10) varies weakly along the angle ϕ without
having a pronounced maximum. In this case, one could expand
the sub-integral function in Eq. (10) in a power series of
k2. As easy to see, this would result in the power series of
sin2 ϕ which can in principle be integrated analytically term
by term. On the other hand, such polynomials can efﬁciently
be integrated by Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobatto quadratures. Thus,
instead of expanding the integral (10) in a power series of
small k2 and then integrating analytically term by term, we
apply a Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobatto quadrature [14] directly to
the integral (12).

To summarize, three different approaches are used for the
evaluation of the Green’s function and its gradient for λ

within the following parameter ranges deﬁned in terms of k2
which actually specify the integral in (10). First, for

IV. NUMERICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND EXAMPLES OF
APPLICATION

The system of two coupled boundary-integral Eqs. (14, 15)
can be solved numerically by the boundary element method
[12]. For this purpose each line Lk forming a closed surface
of a part of the conducting body of rotation, which may
be simply or multiply connected,
is approximated by N
rectilinear segments with endpoints pointed by radius vectors
ri, i = 1, .., N + 1. The integrals in Eqs. (14-16) along
each contour are replaced by the sums over the corresponding
boundary elements where the integrals over each boundary
element are approximated by four-point Gauss quadratures
[17]. When the observation and integration points coincide
there is a logarithmic singularity in the Green’s function which
is subtracted and integrated analytically over the corresponding
element. In the simplest case,
the unknown functions are
considered to be constant within each element that results in
2N unknown quantities which are the constant values of Ψ(r)
and ∂Ψ(r)
in each element. Upon evaluation of both Eqs. (14,
15) at the midpoint of each element we obtain a system of 2N

∂n

complex linear equations. For a typical number of unknowns
of about several hundreds this problem can straightforwardly
be solved by an LU decomposition.

In the following, we consider two simple examples of appli-
cation of the method. The ﬁrst example is a conducting sphere
of radius R0 in a uniform external ac magnetic ﬁeld with
induction amplitude B0. In this case, the contour encircling
the whole free space in Eq. (14) may be considered to consist
of two contours where L encloses the sphere while the second
one encloses some remote inductor creating a uniform ﬁeld
with Ψ0(r) = r2/2 that corresponds to the vector potential
scaled by A0 = R0B0.

Thus Eq. (14) for the outer surface of the sphere takes the

form

whereas the corresponding Eq. (15) for the inner surface
remains unchanged. The distributions of Ψ(r) and ∂Ψ(r)

in Fig. 1 to be in good agreement with the corresponding

gradient, as in Ref. [20], with 64 and 128 Gauss-Chebyshev-
Lobatto quadrature points that results in a signiﬁcantly lower
accuracy at both low and high frequencies. As seen in Fig.
2(b),
the accuracy decreases at high frequencies where a
larger number of boundary elements is required. Note that
1 is due to
the relatively slow convergence rate of about
the low accuracy of constant boundary elements used in this
example.

As a next example we consider a model inductor consisting
of two coaxial mirror-symmetric rings of trapezoidal cross-
section as shown in Fig. 3 related to the crystal growth appli-
cation by the ﬂoating zone technique [24]. The upper, primary,
ring deﬁned by the contour L0 is connected to a power source
supplying ac current I = I0 cos(ωt). The current in the
lower, secondary, ring L1, which is short-circuited through
an additional impedance Z2, is induced only by the magnetic
ﬁeld of the upper ring. In this case, we have two additional

potential Φ0 and Φ1 in the primary and secondary inductors.
Respectively, we have two additional equations for the circuits
of primary and secondary rings I0 =
and
2πΦ1/Z2 = 0, which are discretized and
R

solved as described above. Our goal here is to choose the
R
additional impedance Z2 so that to have the current induced in
the secondary ring of the same amplitude but delayed in phase
by 90 degrees with respect to the current in the primary ring.
The corresponding magnetic ﬂux lines calculated using 150
equally-sized boundary elements in each ring are plotted in
Fig. 3 for various dimensionless frequencies. It has to be noted
that the problem tends to be ill-conditioned at ¯ω = 0 and, thus,
special care is necessary for calculation of the geometrical
parameter c(r) deﬁned by Eq. (16) in order to obtain accurate
solutions at low frequencies ¯ω
1 which, however, are not
very important for practical applications. The dimensionless
impedances of primary and secondary circuits are plotted in
Fig. 4(a) for the secondary current of the same amplitude but
π/2 phase lag relative to the primary one. As seen, the results
of the present approach are in good agreement with those of
the boundary impedance condition (BIC) approximation which
becomes applicable at sufﬁciently high frequencies (¯ω > 102).
The results shown in Fig. 4(a) imply that for ¯ω & 30 the
impedance of the secondary ring can be compensated by an
additional impedance Z2 = R + 1
i¯ωC containing active and
capacitative components denoted by R and C, respectively.
The relative amplitudes of the secondary current are plotted
in Fig. 4(b) versus the dimensionless frequency for various
impedances added in the circuit of the secondary coil. The
solid curve corresponds to the short-circuited secondary ring.
As seen, the capacitance determines the resonance frequency
at which the amplitude of the secondary current attains a
maximum while its phase becomes delayed by π/2 with
respect to that of the primary current. The resistance is added
to balance the amplitude of the secondary current with that of
the primary one at the resonance frequency.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a boundary-integral equation method
for the calculation of poloidal axisymmetric magnetic ﬁelds
applicable in a wide range of ac frequencies. The method is
based on the vector potential formulation and uses Green’s
functions for Laplace and Helmholtz equations for the exterior
and interior of conductors. Particular attention was paid to the
calculation of Green’s function for the Helmholtz equation
which underlies our approach. In contrast
to the Laplace
equation, there is no simple analytic solution for the ax-
isymmetric Green’s function of the Helmholtz equation. Thus,
the corresponding function as well as its gradient has to be
calculated numerically that
is done by three different ap-
proaches depending on the parameter range. For low and high
dimensionless frequencies we use power series expansions in
terms of elliptical integrals and asymptotic series in terms of
modiﬁed Bessel functions, respectively. For the intermediate
frequency range, Gauss-Chebyshev-Lobatto quadratures are
used.

Our way of calculation of the Green’s function differs
considerably from previous approaches. Note that, on the one
hand, our derivation of the axisymmetric Green’s function is
more straightforward and leads to considerably simpler ana-
lytic expressions compared to the Fourier series representation
in terms of Bessel/Hankel and Legendre functions obtained
by variable separation in spherical coordinates [21] or to the
Fourier/Bessel integrals obtained by the corresponding integral
transforms in the cylindrical coordinates [22], [23]. Fourier se-
ries and the corresponding integrals are computationally more
expensive because they contain products of special functions
of a varying argument whereas the power and asymptotic
series in our case contain only a single special function of
a ﬁxed argument and varying order which can efﬁciently be
calculated using recursion. Moreover, the selective calculation
of the Green’s function by either numerical quadratures, power
or asymptotic series depending on its argument provides the
best convergence in each parameter range and, thus, it is
obviously more efﬁcient numerically than a general Fourier
series or corresponding integrals. On the other hand, the way
in which we calculate the Green’s function differs signiﬁcantly
from the approach of Huang et al. [20] who evaluate integral
(10) numerically. Although before integration they subtract
the Green’s function for the Laplace equation in order to
remove the singularity from the integrand, the discontinuities
still remain in derivatives and deteriorate the accuracy of the
numerical integration when the observation point approaches
the contour of integration. Additional difﬁculties with numer-
ical integration arise at high dimensionless frequencies when
the exponential function in the integrand (10) decays in a fast
and oscillatory way.

We avoid these problems by calculating the Green’s function
analytically in the form of power and asymptotic series for low
and high frequencies, respectively.

The method was veriﬁed by comparison with the analytic
solution for a sphere in a uniform ac magnetic ﬁeld. In
addition, the performance of the method was demonstrated
for a composite model inductor supplied with a current of
ﬁxed amplitude and containing a secondary coil with an
external circuit. In this case, the results were checked by
comparison with an approximate solution obtained by the
boundary impedance condition which becomes applicable at
sufﬁciently high ac frequencies. The accuracy of the numerical
solution deteriorates at very low frequencies where an increase
of the number of boundary elements is necessary to obtain a
smooth distribution of the magnetic ﬁeld component shifted
in phase by π/2 with respect to the applied potential.

The proposed method is well suited for the numerical
calculation of axisymmetric poloidal magnetic ﬁeld inductors
of complicated geometrical conﬁgurations at intermediate ac
frequencies because it requires only the surface but no spatial
discretization.

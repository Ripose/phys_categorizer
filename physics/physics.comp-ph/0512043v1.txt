How a Long Bubble Shrinks: a Numerical
Method for an Unforced Hele-Shaw Flow

Abstract

We develop a numerical method for solving a free boundary problem which de-
scribes shape relaxation, by surface tension, of a long and thin bubble of an inviscid
ﬂuid trapped inside a viscous ﬂuid in a Hele-Shaw cell. The method of solution of
the exterior Dirichlet problem employs a classical boundary integral formulation.
Our version of the numerical method is especially advantageous for following the
dynamics of a very long and thin bubble, for which an asymptotic scaling theory
has been recently developed. Because of the very large aspect ratio of the bubble, a
direct implementation of the boundary integral algorithm would be impractical. We
modify the algorithm by introducing a new approximation of the integrals which
appear in the Fredholm integral equation and in the integral expression for the
normal derivative of the pressure at the bubble interface. The new approximation
allows one to considerably reduce the number of nodes at the almost ﬂat part of the
bubble interface, while keeping a good accuracy. An additional beneﬁt from the new
approximation is in that it eliminates numerical divergence of the integral for the
tangential derivative of the harmonic conjugate. The interface’s position is advanced
in time by using explicit node tracking, whereas the larger node spacing enables one
to use larger time steps. The algorithm is tested on two model problems, for which
approximate analytical solutions are available.

1 Introduction

Let a bubble of low-viscosity ﬂuid (say, air) get trapped inside a high-viscosity
ﬂuid (say, oil) in a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw cell: two parallel plates
with a narrow gap between them. What will happen to the shape of the bubble,
if the (horizontal) plates of the Hele-Shaw cell are perfectly smooth, and the

two ﬂuids are immiscible? The answer depends on the initial bubble shape. A
perfectly circular bubble (or an inﬁnite straight strip) will not change, while a
bubble of any other shape will undergo surface-tension-driven relaxation until
it either becomes a perfect circle, or breaks into two or more bubbles, which
then become perfect circles. The bubble shape relaxation process is non-local,
as it is mediated by a ﬂow in the external viscous ﬂuid. The two-dimensional
surface-tension-driven ﬂow can be called an unforced Hele-Shaw (UHS) ﬂow.
This is in contrast to forced Hele-Shaw ﬂows that have been in the focus
of hydrodynamics and nonlinear and computational physics for the last two
decades [1,2,3,4,5]. In rescaled variables, the UHS ﬂow is described by the
solution of the following free boundary problem, see e.g. Refs. [6,7]:

where E is an unbounded region of the plane, external to the bubble interface
γ, vn is the normal velocity of the interface, the index n denotes the component
of vectors normal to the interface, and K is the local curvature of the interface.
The pressure p is bounded at inﬁnity. The free boundary problem (1)-(3) splits
into two sub-problems:

(1) Solving the exterior Dirichlet problem (1) and (2) and calculating vn(q)

from Eq. (3).

(2) Advancing the interface γ in time with the known vn(q).

The free boundary problem (1)-(3) represents an important example of area-
preserving curve-shortening motion [8], but it is not integrable. Moreover,
the only analytical solution to this problem, available until recently, was the
approximate solution following from a linear stability analysis of a slightly
deformed circular or ﬂat interface [9]. Recently an asymptotic scaling theory
has been developed for a non-trivial case when the inviscid ﬂuid occupies,
at t = 0, a half-inﬁnite (or, physically, very long) strip [7]. It turned out
that this somewhat unusual initial condition provides a useful characterization
of the UHS ﬂow, as the evolving strip, which develops a dumbbell shape,
exhibits approximate self-similarity with non-trivial dynamic exponents [7].
Predictions of the scaling analysis have been veriﬁed numerically in Ref. [7]
by using a boundary integral algorithm, tailored to the very large aspect ratio
of the bubble. The present paper describes this algorithm in detail.

A multitude of numerical methods have been suggested in the recent years for
simulating diﬀerent variants of Hele-Shaw ﬂows. Boundary integral methods,
which deal directly with the interface between the two ﬂuids, are advantageous

2

compared to methods of ﬁnite elements and ﬁnite diﬀerences. Methods based
on conformal mapping techniques have long been used in this class of problems
(see, e.g. Refs. [2,11,12]). However, they apply most naturally to the case of
zero surface tension and are less convenient when surface tension is non-zero
[10]. Still another numerical strategy is phase ﬁeld methods. Folch et al. [13,14]
developed a phase ﬁeld method for an arbitrary ratio of the viscosities of the
two ﬂuids. Unfortunately, their method becomes ineﬃcient when the viscosity
contrast is too high [14]. To remind the reader, the viscosity contrast is inﬁnite
in the case under consideration in the present work. Glasner [15] developed
a phase ﬁeld method for a description of a bubble of a high-viscosity ﬂuid
trapped in a low-viscosity ﬂuid. We are unaware of any phase-ﬁeld approach
which would deal with the opposite case, which is under investigation in the
present work: a low-viscosity bubble in a high-viscosity ﬂuid.

The present work suggests a numerical algorithm for solving the free bound-
ary problem (1)-(3) in the special case of a very long bubble. It is well-known
(but still remarkable) that the exterior Dirichlet problem (1) and (2) can be
formulated in terms of a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for
an eﬀective density of the dipole moment [16]. A na¨ıve formulation, however,
would lead to non-existence of solution by the Fredholm alternative [17]. To
overcome this diﬃculty, Greenbaum et al. [17] implemented in their algorithm
a modiﬁcation of the Fredholm equation due to Mikhlin [18]. The modiﬁed
Fredholm equation has a unique solution for any smooth γ and integrable
K
[18]. Greenbaum et al. developed an eﬃcient numerical algorithm (which is
also valid for multiple bubbles) by discretization. However, the geometry of
a very long and thin bubble, that we are mostly interested in, deﬁnes widely
diﬀerent length scales in the problem. Rapid variations of the dipole moment
density at the highly curved ends of the bubble naturally necessitate a small
spacing between the interface nodes. It is less natural, however, that, in a
straightforward approach, one must keep the node spacing much smaller than
the bubble thickness over the whole bubble interface. Indeed, as we show below,
the typical length scale of the variation of the kernel of the integral equation is
comparable to the bubble thickness which, during the most interesting part of
the long bubble dynamics, remains almost unchanged. Apart from being com-
putationally ineﬃcient, the straightforward approach would cause a problem
for explicit tracking of nodes, as the stability criterion, intrinsic in the explicit
method, demands a time step less then a constant
(1) multiplied by the
node spacing cubed [19]. In this work we turned this obstacle into advantage,
by employing the fact that the length scale of variation of the solution, over
the most of the bubble interface, is much greater than the bubble thickness.
We constructed a new approximation of the integral entering the Fredholm
equation, by representing the sought dipole moment density as a piecewise
constant function, and the bubble interface shape function as a piecewise lin-
ear function. As a result, the integral is approximated by a sum, each term of
which is equal to a local value of the dipole moment density multiplied by an

integral of the kernel between two neighboring nodes. Fortunately, the latter
integral can be calculated analytically. The new approximation allowed us to
considerably increase the node spacing over the most of the bubble interface,
while keeping a good accuracy.

tial, one needs to compute the normal derivative of the solution
a straightforward realization of the boundary integral formulation this would
result in a hypersingular integral, see Ref. [17]. To overcome this diﬃculty, one
resorts to theory of analytic functions and computes the harmonic conjugate
V (q). By virtue of the Cauchy-Riemann equations, the tangential derivative
of V (q) is equal to the desired normal derivative of p. The harmonic conjugate
V (q) has the form of a principal value integral, over the interface, of the dipole
moment density multiplied by a kernel, which is a function of coordinates of
two points, q and g, belonging to the interface. This kernel diverges when the
integration variable g coincides with q. Here we again employ the large scale
diﬀerence at the ﬂat part of the bubble and use the same approximation as
in the Fredholm equation. As an additional beneﬁt, the numerical divergence
of the integrand of the harmonic conjugate V is avoided. As a result, we do
not need to use even nodes to compute V at odd nodes and vice-versa, as
suggested in Ref. [17].

Here is a layout of the rest of the paper. Section 2 deals with the numeri-
cal solution of the exterior Dirichlet problem, and with the computation of
the normal derivative of the solution at the interface. We brieﬂy review the
boundary integral method for an exterior Dirichlet problem and motivate the
need for its modiﬁcation for very long bubbles. Then we formulate our discrete
approximation. In Section 3 we brieﬂy describe a simple explicit integration
which we used to track the bubble interface. Section 4 presents the results of
code testing, while Section 5 presents the Conclusions.

Following Mikhlin [18], we seek the solution p(q) of the problem(1) and (2)

exterior, satisfying the boundary condition Eq. (2). This representation was
employed by Greenbaum et al. [17] for numerical analysis.

where the kernel (9) has a removable discontinuity. The method suggested in
[17] prescribes instead to use an analytic evaluation of the kernel at the point
of removable discontinuity.

We solved the algebraic equations (15) by an iterative reﬁnement method after
a LU factorization of the matrix. As the maximum number of equations in the
examples that we considered (see below) did not exceed 1100, there was no
need to use more sophisticated methods.

2.3 Grid

Most of our results were obtained with the version of the code which assumed a
four-fold symmetry of the bubble. This allowed us to work with a one quarter
of the interface and reduce the number of nodes by 4. In the beginning of
the bubble relaxation, the solution varies rapidly in the region of the lobes,
and very slowly in the ﬂat region of the bubble. Therefore one should employ
here a non-uniform grid. At later times, when the aspect ratio of the bubble
becomes comparable to unity, the code switches to a uniform grid. For the
non-uniform grid we used an exponential spacing. Here the node spacing grows
exponentially from the lobe’s end to the middle of the ﬂat part of the bubble.
To generate the node distribution we use the following procedure. Let the
quarter of the interface perimeter be Π, the speciﬁed number of nodes be m,
and the speciﬁed smallest spacing in the lobe region be h0.

If Π > h0(m
η which satisﬁes the condition

−

1), the exponential grid is used. Here we introduce the quantity

Π = h0 + ηh0 + η2h0 + . . . + ηm−2h0 =

(16)

h0(1

solve Eq. (16) numerically for η, use a discrete arclength parametrization:
ξ2 = h0, . . . , ξk = ηk−2h0, . . . , ξm = ηm−2h0, and calculate the arrays
ξ1 = 0,
x = x(ξi) and y = y(ξi), where i = 1, 2, . . . , m.

In the process of the interface evolution Π decreases with time, so one can
reduce the number of the grid nodes. Furthermore, as the nodes in our code
move like lagrangian particles (see Section 3), the node spacing in the lobe
region decreases with time even faster. If left unattended, this would cause
instability of the node tracking (see Section 3), as the maximum allowed time
step is proportional to the node spacing cubed [19]. Therefore, when the min-
imum node spacing decreases below ξ2 = 0.8h0, we redistribute the nodes: we
look for the new value of η, corresponding to the updated value of Π, cal-
culate the new array of ξ, and determine the new arrays x and y by linear
interpolation.

When the perimeter goes down so that Π

diverges. To overcome this problem, Ref. [17] suggested to divide the mesh
into odd and even nodes and compute V at the odd points by summing over
the even nodes, and vice-versa. Our analytical integration yields the correct
principal value of the integral, so there is no need to use the recipe of Ref.
[17].

where ε is an input parameter which has to be suﬃciently small to satisfy
the requirements of stability and desired accuracy. In the exact formulation
(1)-(3) the bubble area must be constant in the process of relaxation. The
area conservation can be conveniently used for accuracy control of the code.

4 Numerical Results

We present here some simulation results produced with our code for two dif-
ferent sets of initial conditions. One of them describes the decay of a small
sinusoidal perturbation of a perfectly circular bubble of inviscid ﬂuid. An ap-
proximate analytical solution to this problem is given by the linear stability
analysis [9], and we used this solution to test the code.

The second initial condition describes a very long and thin strip of inviscid
ﬂuid. In the process of its shrinking the bubble develops a dumbbell shape,
while the characteristic dimensions of the dumbbell exhibit asymptotic scaling
laws found in Ref. [7].

4.1 Relaxation of a slightly perturbed circle

Let the initial shape of the interface be a circle with a small sinusoidal per-
turbation:

ρ(ϕ, 0) = R0[1 + δ(0) sin(nϕ)] ,

where ρ and ϕ are the polar radius and angle, respectively, R0 is the radius
of the unperturbed interface, while δ(0) and n are the initial amplitude and

A typical numerical result is presented in Fig. 3. The parameters are R0 = 100,

symmetry which allows a direct application of our code. In this simulation the

4.2 Relaxation of a long and thin bubble

In the second setting the initial interface shape is a very long rectangular strip.
In the example we report here the initial strip thickness was 1, and the initial
length 2000. Here we could compare the numerical results with the predictions
of a recent asymptotic scaling analysis [7]. The interface shapes at diﬀerent
times are presented in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the shrinking strip acquires
the shape of a dumbbell (or petal). At much later times it approaches circular
shape. By the end of the simulation (at t = 48000) the relative deviation of the

To verify the self-similarity of the dumbbell shape in the lobe region, predicted
in Ref. [7], we introduce a new function h(x1, t) so that h[x1(x, t), t] = y(x, t).

Fig. 6. Self-similarity of the lobe. Shown is the shape function h(x1, t), rescaled to
the maximum dumbbell elevation, versus the coordinate x1, rescaled to the abscissa
of the maximum, at times 160.3 (the ﬁlled circles), 1000 (the squares), and 3010
(the empty circles).

Figure 6 shows the spatial proﬁles of h rescaled to the values of hmax versus

conﬁrms the expected self-similarity.

The initial number of nodes in this simulation was 1100, and the smallest
spacing in the lobe region was 0.4. With the grid interpolation employed, the
time-step parameter ε = 0.005 proved suﬃciently small to guarantee stability
and good accuracy. As the curvature of the interface goes down during the
10−3 at
evolution, the required time step increases signiﬁcantly. It was 1.7
t = 0, 0.22 at t = 3670 and increased up to about 10 by the end of the
simulation, at t = 48000. We used the small observed area loss of the bubble
for accuracy control. The observed area loss was less then 0.5% for t < 10000.
By the end of the simulation, at t = 48000, the area loss reached only 2.8%.

5 Conclusion

We have developed and tested a new numerical version of the boundary in-
tegral method for an exterior Dirichlet problem, which is especially suitable
for long and thin domains. The method allows one to signiﬁcantly reduce the
number of the interfacial nodes. The new method was successfully tested in a
numerical investigation of the shape relaxation, by surface tension, of a long
and thin bubble, ﬁlled with an inviscid ﬂuid and immersed in a viscous ﬂuid
in a Hele-Shaw cell. Here we conﬁrmed the recent theoretical predictions on
the self-similarity and dynamic scaling behavior during an intermediate stage
of the bubble dynamics.

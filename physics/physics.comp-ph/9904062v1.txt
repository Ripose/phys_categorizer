The melting transition of the ﬁve diﬀerent lattices of a
bilayer crystal is studied using the Monte-Carlo technique.
We found the surprising result that the square lattice has a
substantial larger melting temperature as compared to the
other lattice structures, which is a consequence of the speciﬁc
topology of the temperature induced defects. A new melt-
ing criterion is formulated which we show to be universal for
bilayers as well as for single layer crystals.

Wigner crystallization of electrons on the surface of liq-
uid helium was ﬁrst observed experimentally by Grimes
and Adams [1]. In the same year, Nelson, Halperin [2],
and Young [3] developed a theory for a two stage con-
tinuous melting of a two dimensional (2D) crystal which
was based on the ideas of Berenzinskii [4], Kosterlitz and
Thouless [5]. Whether melting of a 2D crystal is a ﬁrst or-
der transition and proceeds discontinuously as described
by the theories of Kleinert [6] and Chui [7], or is a second
order transition in which the crystal ﬁrst transits into
a hexatic phase retaining quasi-long-range orientational
order and then melts into an isotropic ﬂuid, is still an
open question and a controversial issue. These studies of
the melting transition of a 2D systems were directed to
single layer crystals, which have the hexagonal symme-
try. This is the most energetically favored structure for
potentials of the form 1/rn [8]. Disorder will inﬂuence
Wigner crystallization as was demonstrated recently in
Refs. [9].

In recent experiments on dusty plasmas [10] and on ion
plasmas [11] few layer and bilayer crystals were observed.
Bilayer systems exhibit a much richer crystal structure
(ﬁve diﬀerent lattice types) as function of the inter-layer
distance. This allows us to study the inﬂuence of the
lattice symmetry on melting. Previously, the diﬀerent
types of lattices and structural transitions in a multilayer
crystal at T = 0 with parabolic conﬁnement was analysed
in [12,13]. Diﬀerent classes of lattices of the double-layer
crystal were speciﬁed in [14] and in [15] the stability of
the classical bilayer crystal was analysed in the harmonic
approximation.

In this letter we study the melting of a classical bilayer
crystal, using the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation tech-
nique.
In the crystal phase the particles are arranged
into two parallel layers in the (x, y)–plane which are a
distance d apart in the z–direction. The layers contain
equal density of particles n/2 and have close packed sym-

metry. A single layer crystal is a limiting case of a bilayer
crystal with d = 0 and particle density n.

We assume that the particles interact through an
isotropic Coulomb (κ = 0) or screened repulsive potential

where q is the particle charge, ǫ the dielectric constant,
~r = (x, y,(z=0, d)) the position of the particle, and 1/κ
is the screening length. The type of lattice symmetry at
T = 0 depends on the dimensionless parameter ν = d/a0,
where d is the interlayer distance and a0 = 1/pπn/2
is the mean interparticle distance. For the classical
Coulomb system (κ = 0) there are two dimensionless pa-
rameters ν and Γ = q2/a0kBT which determine the state
= 0) at
of the system. The classical Yukawa system (κ
T
= 0 is characterised by three independent dimension-
less parameters: ν, Γ and λ = κa0. Below we measure
the temperature in units of T0 = q2/a0kB and the energy
in E0 = kBT0.

The initial symmetry of the structure is set by the
primitive vectors, the values of which are derived from a
calculation of the minimal energy conﬁguration for ﬁxed
ν. In [15] it was found that the bilayer Coulomb crys-
tal exhibits ﬁve diﬀerent types of lattices as function of
the interlayer distance at T = 0: ν < 0.006– hexago-
nal, 0.006 < ν < 0.262–rectangular, 0.262 < ν < 0.621–
square, 0.621 < ν < 0.732–rhombic, and ν > 0.732–
hexagonal. Using the standard Metropolis algorithm [16]
we allow the system to approach its equilibrium state
at some temperature T , after executing 104
105
‘MC steps’. Each MC step is formed by a random dis-
placement of one particle. If the new conﬁguration has
a smaller energy it is accepted and if the new energy
is larger the conﬁguration is accepted with probability
δ < exp(
∆E/T ), where δ is a random number between
0 and 1 and ∆E is the increment in the energy. In our
numerical calculations the number of particles N may
change for diﬀerent types of bilayer crystals, but the par-
ticle density remains the same. We took fragments of
288 to 780 particles, where the shape of the specimen
was determined by the T = 0 crystal structure, and used
periodic boundary conditions. Applying the Ewald tech-
nique the potential energy is found by summation over
all particles and their periodical images.

The potential energy of the system as function of tem-
perature is shown in Fig. 1. In the crystalline state the
potential energy of the system rises linearly with tem-
perature and then at some critical temperature it in-

creases very steeply. This denotes the beginning of melt-
ing and is related to the unbinding of dislocation pairs,
which we will discuss below. The square bilayer crys-
tal (ν = 0.4) exhibits a jump in the potential energy
10−2kBT0, and which
at melting of size δe = 0.71
is about a factor 2 larger than for a hexagonal lattice,
10−2kBT0, and at ν = 0.8,
i.e. at ν = 0, δe = 0.39
10−2kBT0. Moreover, the square lattice
δe = 0.31
has a substantial higher melting temperature, and conse-
quently is more stable against thermal ﬂuctuations than
the hexagonal lattice.

where index i = 1, 2 refers to the top and the bottom lay-
ers, respectively, and the total bond-angular order factor
of the bilayer crystal is deﬁned as Gθ = (G1
θ)/2 and
similar for Gtr. Nnb is the number of nearest neighbour
particles (Nnb = 6, 4 for the hexagonal and square lat-
tices, respectively), θj,n is the angle between some ﬁxed
axis and the vector which connects the jth particle and
its nearest nth neighbour, and ~G is a reciprocal–lattice
vector.

From the behaviour of the order factors we can derive
the temperature at which order is lost in the system. As
seen from Fig. 2(a) the translational and orientational
order is lost at the same temperature. Our numerical
results show that for all ﬁve types of lattices the bond-
angular order factor: 1) decreases linearly with increasing
temperature (except very close to the melting temper-
ature), and 2) it drops to zero just after it reaches the
value 0.45. We found that Gθ exhibits a universal behav-
ior as shown in Fig. 2(b). We checked this for the bilayer
crystal with screened and unscreened Coulomb interac-
tion and for a single layer crystal with a Lennard-Jones
V = 1/r12
1/r6 and a repulsive V = 1/r12 interaction
potential. From the present numerical results for Gθ we
formulate a new criterion for melting which we believe is
universal: melting occurs when the bond-angle correlation
factor becomes Gθ ≈
Given the above mentioned criterion for melting we
calculated the melting temperature using the harmonic
approximation. Therefore, we numerically diagonalized
the Hessian matrix [18] for the ﬁnite fragment of the ideal
structure at zero temperature of the crystal with period-
ical boundary conditions in order to obtain the eigenval-
ues. We checked that an increase of the size of the crystal
fragment does not change our results. The melting tem-
perature is then derived by linear extrapolating Gθ to

0.45.

the value 0.45. In this way we obtained analytically Tmel
for diﬀerent types of lattices which agrees with our MC
calculations within 10%.

Our results for the melting temperature are sum-
marised in the phase diagram of Fig. 3 where we show
the melting temperature as a function of ν for two dif-
ferent values of the screening parameter: λ = 0 for
a Coulomb inter- particle interaction and λ = 1 for a
screened Coulomb interaction. For ν = 0 and λ = 0 we
obtained the well-known value for the critical Γ = 132,
resulting in Tmel = 0.0076T0. This critical value was ﬁrst
measured in Ref. [1] and found to be 137

15.

As seen in Fig. 3 the hexagonal (I and V), rectangular
(II) and rhombic (IV) lattices melt at almost the same
temperatures. Further increasing the inter-layer distance
Tmel(ν =
we found that for ν
0)/√2. For the square bilayer crystal (phase III) the
melting temperature increases up to Tmel = 0.01078T0
with rising ν and only for ν > 0.4 we found that Tmel
starts to decrease with increasing ν. It is surprising that
the square lattice has a substantial larger melting tem-
perature than the other lattices. This is true for Coulomb
(λ = 0) inter-particle interaction as well as for screened
Coulomb.

The detail analysis of the melting of the crystal in the
vicinity of the structural phase boundary is much more
complicated due to the softening of a phonon mode as
shown in Ref. [15] and is left for future work. To under-
stand why the square lattice bilayer crystal has a consid-
erable larger melting temperature, we investigated vari-
ous temperature induced isomers of a single layer crystal
and compared them with those of the square lattice bi-
layer crystal with ν = 0.4 which has the largest melting
temperature. For bilayer crystals the topology of the de-
fects is viewed as being composed by the top and the
bottom staggered layers. Note, that the energy of the
defects which occurs in the square lattice depends on
the interlayer distance. At given temperature we found
that during the MC simulation the system transits from
one metastable state to another. They diﬀer by the ap-
pearance of isomers in the crystal structure which ap-
pear with diﬀerent probabilities. We found these iso-
mers by freezing instant particle conﬁgurations during
our MC steps. The topology of the defects, their energy
and the bond-angular and the translational order fac-
tors of these conﬁgurations are determined. Each point
in Fig. 4(a,b) represents one conﬁguration containing an
isomer in a single layer and the square lattice bilayer
crystals, respectively. The qualitative behaviour of both
crystals during melting is similar although the energy
of the defects in both lattice structures is substantially
diﬀerent. For the single layer (ν = 0, Fig. 4(a)), all
isomers at T1 = 0.00756T0, just before melting, and at
T2 = 0.0076T0 just after melting, were obtained. Note,
that for the square lattice (ν = 0.4, Fig. 4(b)), we took
T1 = 0.01076T0 and T2 = 0.01078T0. Typical calculated
defect structures obtained from instant particle conﬁg-

urations freezed to T = 0 are shown in Fig. 5(a,b) for
the hexagonal layer and in Fig. 5(c-f) for the square bi-
layer crystal. First, at T = T1 the quartet of bound
disclinations (Fig. 5(a)), point defects (Fig. 5(c,d)) and
correlated dislocation (Fig. 5(e)) are formed. The point
defects appear in pairs in our MC calculations, which are
a consequence of the periodic boundary condition. Note
that in a single layer crystal the total energy of a non
bounded pair of a ‘centred vacancy’ and a ‘centred in-
terstitial’ is E = 0.29kBT0. In the square bilayer crystal
the point defects like ‘vacancy’ and the ‘interstitial’, de-
picted in Fig. 5(c,d), appear also in pairs and the energy
of this unbounded pair is E = 0.315kBT0. The discli-
nations bound into a quartet and point defects produce
only a negligible eﬀect on the periodic lattice structure
0.95 (group A in
and Gθ = 0.8
Fig. 4(a,b)). It should be noted that in spite of prolonged
105 MC steps at a tem-
annealing of the system during 5
perature T1, which is just below melting, we did not ﬁnd
more complex isomers than point defects and quartets of
disclinations.

At the temperature T = T2 uncorrelated extended dis-
locations with non-zero Burgers vector and unbounded
disclination pairs are formed which causes a substantial
decrease of the translational order (group B in Fig. 4(a,b)
and defects shown in Fig. 5(b,f)). At this temperature
single disclinations appear and the system looses order,
both order factors become small and the system transits
to the isotropic ﬂuid (group C in Fig. 4(a,b)).

Fig. 4(a,b) clearly illustrates that for a square lattice
the defects which are able to destroy the translational and
orientational order have a substantial larger energy than
those of a single layer crystal with hexagonal symmetry.
As a whole the localised and extended dislocations as
well as disclinations in the square bilayer crystal are de-
fects with a higher energy as compared to the ones in the
hexagonal bilayer crystal. Thus, the square type bilayer
crystal requires larger energies in order to create defects
which are responsible for the loss of the bond-orientional
and the translational order and thus for melting of the
crystal.

In conclusion, we studied the melting temperature of
the ﬁve lattice structures in a bilayer crystal and found
evidence that the melting temperature depends on the
crystal symmetry. A square lattice has a substantial
larger melting temperature than e.g. a hexagonal lat-
tice. In order to understand this result we investigated
the defect structures responsible for melting and found
that the defects in a square lattice have a larger energy
as compared to those in a hexagonal structure and conse-
quently larger thermal energy is required to create them.
We also formulated a new melting criterion:
in two di-
mensional layers and bilayers melting occurs when the
bond-angular order factor is Gθ = 0.45, which is inde-
pendent of the functional form of the interparticle inter-
action.

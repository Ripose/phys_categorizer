The detail structure of the wave function is analyzed at various reﬁnement levels using the methods
of wavelet analysis. The eigenvalue problem of a model system is solved in granular Hilbert spaces,
and the trajectory of the eigenstates is traced in terms of the resolution. An adaptive method is
developed for identifying the ﬁne structure localization regions, where further reﬁnement of the wave
function is necessary.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Multiresolution or wavelet analysis (MRA) [1, 2] is in-
creasingly used in advanced data compression and image
coding algorithms [3], and several promising approaches
applied this technique in describing electronic structures.
Arias et al. [4] elaborated a Kohn-Sham equation based
density functional (DFT) method, Goedecker and Ivanov
[5] have also successfully used wavelets for the solution
of Poisson’s equation. There are also attempts to extend
wavelet calculations to three dimensional structures in a
computationally manageable manner [6].

The basic principle of the application of MRA is the
recognition that the details of the electronic structure are
not distributed equally over diﬀerent parts of the system.
In data compression the details of the picture are system-
atically included by consecutive reﬁnements of the image
only in those spatial regions where it is necessary. A
similar approach to the electronic wave function suggests
that the ﬁne details of the distribution are concentrated
around the nuclear cusps and singularities of the two-
electron density matrix.
It has been shown, that the
surroundings of a molecule can be described at a rather
rough resolution level [7]. We have also demonstrated [8],
that the extremely hardly representable electron-electron
cusp singularity of the two-electron density operator can
be easily reproduced by the method of multiresolution
analysis.

The applicability of these approaches strongly depends
on the necessary depth of reﬁnement. Clearly, a uniform
reﬁnement of the distributions leads to an exponential
increase of the computational eﬀorts with growing reso-
lution level. The region where the reﬁnements are applied
has to be conﬁned, in order to achieve computationally
In this contribution we study
manageable algorithms.

some questions concerning several aspects raised by the
above considerations. We analyze the detail structure
of the wave function, we explore how the spatial regions
where further reﬁnement is necessary are to be identi-
ﬁed, and how can the extension of the eigenvalue problem
to new subspaces be restricted. We trace how the pro-
jection of the wave function to diﬀerent resolution level
subspaces is changing in the course of the consecutive
reﬁnement steps. The performance of the adaptive re-
ﬁnement algorithm is tested by numerical comparisons
to the exact analytical solution of the harmonic oscilla-
tor.

essary to fulﬁll (5) with a good approximation. Clearly,
a predictive method is needed.

A. Decomposition of exact wave functions

We will illustrate the above consideration with a sim-
ple exactly solvable example in D = 1 dimension. The

is clear, that the bulk of the states is described at level
m = 0, and the contributions of the detail spaces disap-
pear with increasing m. It is important to realize, that

even if the number of basis functions in subspace Wm in-

the wave function exponentially decreases. This results
coincides with our previous statement [10] that many-
electron density operators can not contain arbitrary ﬁne
(nor rough) details.

B. Fine structure localization

Besides a “vertical” truncation of the Hilbert space
over a suﬃciently large resolution level M , there is a
possibility of reducing the size of the subspaces Wm in
a “horizontal” truncation process, by decimating the ba-
sis functions wmℓ which belong to those spatial regions
where the wave function does not contain ﬁne details.

In order to study the extent of this ﬁne structure
localization, we have also examined, how many coeﬃ-

COARSE-GRAINED HILBERT SPACES

In applied calculations the granularity M of the Hilbert
space (i.e., the maximum resolution m in the summations
of (1) and (4)) can not be arbitrary large. Instead, for a
ﬁnite granularity M the eigenvalue problem is solved in

At any resolution level, the x2 and x operators can

ing functions [1]. Wavelets are also ﬁnite linear com-

IV. AN ADAPTIVE METHOD FOR
DETERMINING FINE STRUCTURE
LOCALIZATION REGIONS

In realistic cases, of course, exact solutions of the eigen-
value problem are not known. We can suppose, how-
ever, that quantum mechanical systems behave similarly
to the simple exact case studied above. We expect, that
high resolution wavelets can completely be omitted, and
even at lower resolutions only a fractional part of them
contribute essentially to the expansion. In the following
considerations we will apply a consistent notation for the
two distinct truncation schemes. Upper index [M ] de-
notes the “vertical” cutoﬀ of the Hilbert space above the
granularity M , whereas tilde is applied to indicate the
“horizontal” truncation in a given detail space Wm.

Based on the methods developed in [9, 12], we suggest
the following criterion for selecting the important basis
functions of WM . The error function (15) will be mea-

The wavelet wMℓ is considered to be “important” if rMℓ
is larger then a given threshold. This test, however, can
not be carried out in a reasonable time for all the basis
functions in WM , as this would require an exponential
amount of work. Here, we apply an adaptive approach.
We test the wavelets wMℓ only for those values of ℓ, where
the support of wMℓ overlaps with the previously found
“important region” of WM−1.
To be more speciﬁc, we apply the following procedure.

1. We select a preliminary set
for which the condition

Ψ[M] approximates Ψ[M] very well.

The results obtained for the wave function with various
precision requirements η are summarized in Tables II and
Ψ[M] calculated in the “horizon-

deviate from the eigenstate Ψ[M] received without trun-

Tab. III shows similar data for a moderate precision re-
quirement η = 0.999999. In this case the wave function
Ψ[M], obtained using the adaptive ﬁne structure localiza-
tion method, gives an excellent approximation to Ψ[M].
e
The error introduced by the “horizontal” truncation is
less, than that of the “vertical” one, up to the resolution
level M = 5.

In case of excited states, the eigenstates of the eigen-
value problem in granular Hilbert spaces with a given
granularity M are less accurate than the ground state.
The deviations due to “horizontal” truncation of the de-
tail spaces, however, only slightly exceed the ground state
values. Consequently, for a given M , the precision η
which was appropriate for ground state calculations will
certainly be applicable in excited state calculations, as
well.

The errors of the approximate energies calculated for
the ground and excited state i = 3 are plotted in Fig. 4
for various precision requirements η. For lower precision
the magnitude of the error saturates at various resolu-
tion levels M , depending on the value of η. This fact,
together with the observation concerning the error of the
wave function, emphasizes the importance of choosing
matching values for the precision requirement η and the
granularity level M .

The adaptive ﬁne structure localization method reduces
the size of the detail spaces considerably, for example,
in the case of nine-9 precision (η = 0.999999999) and

We have shown, that the ﬁne structure of the Hilbert
space vanishes exponentially in realistic wave functions.
Realizing this fact, one can obtain excellent approxima-
tions of the eigenfunctions by omitting the ﬁne resolution
detail spaces and solving the eigenvalue problem in gran-
ular Hilbert spaces. We have traced the trajectories of
the approximate wave functions of an exactly solvable
model system, and concluded, that they approach the
exact wave function exponentially fast. A similar state-
ment is valid for the approximate energy values.

complexity of the calculations, that higher resolution
wavelets are included in the basis set only in those spa-
tial regions where the ﬁne structure of the wave function
requires it. For our model system we found, that the
number of signiﬁcant basis functions is considerably less
than the dimension of the detail subspaces included in
full calculations. The a priori selection of the signiﬁcant
basis functions needs a predictive algorithm.

Based on the above concept, we have developed an
adaptive method for selecting the essential basis func-
tions using the ﬁne structure localization technique. Cal-
culations in truncated Hilbert spaces, restricted in such
manner lead to suﬃciently precise wave functions and
eigenenergies, even in the case of moderately strict basis
function selection criterion.

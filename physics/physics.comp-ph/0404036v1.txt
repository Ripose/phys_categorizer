of multiparticle collisions

Using the molecular dynamics method, we examine a discrete deterministic model for the motion
of spherical particles in three-dimensional space. The model takes into account multiparticle colli-
sions in arbitrary forms. Using fractional calculus we proposed an expression for the repulsive force,
which is the so called fractional interaction law. We then illustrate and discuss how to control (cor-
relate) the energy dissipation and the collisional time for an individual particle within multiparticle
collisions. In the multiparticle collisions we included the friction mechanism needed for the transi-
tion from coupled torsion-sliding friction through rolling friction to static friction. Analysing simple
simulations we found that in the strong repulsive state binary collisions dominate. However, within
multiparticle collisions weak repulsion is observed to be much stronger. The presented numerical
results can be used to realistically model the impact dynamics of an individual particle in a group
of colliding particles.

INTRODUCTION

Nature of particulate ﬂows oﬀers the physics and en-
gineering communities an opportunity to analyse the in-
teresting behaviour of granular materials. From a phe-
nomenological point of view such a ﬂow, being halfway
between a solid and a liquid state, is not well understood
because the basic physics is extremely complex. In a lo-
cal state, the simplest form of the granular dynamics is
as follows - during an arbitrary extortion particles move
individually and during collisions particles may exchange
their momenta and energies. Therefore the collision pro-
cess plays a dominant role in the development of theoret-
ical studies and also in the performance of simulations.
For an understanding of the collision process we need to
consider a simple situation, focusing on what happens
when two particles collide. In other words, we need to be
able to distinguish the following basic phenomena: static
contact [6], cohesion [8, 31], attrition [34], erosion [19]
and fragmentation [14]. These phenomena may occur
simultaneously or respectively when an individual parti-
cle impacts with another. After impact separation [24]
or clusterisation [3] of the two particles occurs. In ad-
dition, the particles may gain or loss mass. Here we
will focus on the dynamics of the collision process which
may be decomposed into impact and contact processes.
However, as the contact process is formed, we can also
notice rebound [24] or static contact [6], or permanent
contact, called cohesion [8]. These processes exist simul-
taneously when we analyse the dynamics of colliding par-
ticles. With regard to the granular dynamics involving
many particles in motion, we can observe multiparticle
collisions [29], especially when particle concentration is
very dense, because collisional times between several bi-

nary particle contacts are higher in comparison to their
separation times. Multiparticle collisions occur when an
individual particle collides with neighbouring particles,
so that those contacts have direct a inﬂuence on each
other. Only, an inﬁnitesimally short collisional time is
required for binary collisions [24]. In all the considered
cases the collision process between the two particles is
characterised through the collisional time, which is de-
pendent on the impact energy and the physical properties
of the contacting surfaces. Moreover, after impact dissi-
pation of energy occurs between the colliding particles.
Therefore the simulations of such dynamics are limited
by assumptions concerning the collision process. One of
the major aspects which needs to be taken into account
in the simulations is how to control (correlate) the colli-
sional time and the energy dissipation associated with an
individual particle during the dynamics of multiparticle
collisions.

Generally two diﬀerent ways exist to model the dynam-
ics of a granular material. The continuum approach [7] is
based on binary collisions of smooth spherical particles.
Unfortunately, the introduction of real quantities such as
distribution of particle dimensions, particle shapes, their
surface wetness and roughness, etc., greatly limit the ap-
plication of continuum models. Balzer et al [2] inform
us that the kinetic theory is useful for the modelling of
gas-solid ﬂow applications in industry: where the geom-
etry involved is complex (many diﬀerent inlets or/and
outlets). However, the kinetic theory cannot reﬂect the
real dynamics involved in multiparticle collisions because
the collisional time is deﬁned only for binary collisions.
The discrete deterministic approach more realistically
reﬂects the collision process. Note that multiparticle
collisions in the discrete approach are decomposed into
several binary collisions. In this approach one may dis-
tinguish two general methods. The molecular dynam-
ics method [27] takes into account an expression for the
repulsive force acting between a pair of contacting par-

ticles.
In this method particles virtually overlap when
a contact occurs. The overlap reﬂects the quantitative
deformations of particle surfaces because the modelling
of realistic deformations would be much too complicated.
The interaction laws [4, 13, 33] in the molecular dynam-
ics method deﬁne basic models of the repulsive force for
two colliding particles. They are valid for particle colli-
sions which are independent from one another. The next
method, called the event driven method [16], assumes
instantaneous changes in the direction and value of par-
ticle velocities according to conservation equations each
time a binary contact occurs. As shown in [17] the basic
diﬀerence between the event driven and molecular dy-
namics methods is the collisional time between a pair of
particles. In the event driven method this time is ide-
ally zero. Note that this situation is quite diﬀerent for
the molecular dynamics method, where the contact time
is greater than zero and is dependent on parameters de-
scribing the structure of two contacting surfaces, and is
of course dependent on the impact energy. However, the
repulsive force models in the molecular dynamics method
underestimate the energy dissipation in multiparticle col-
lisions [18, 25] (This is the so called “detachment eﬀect”)
but in the event driven method an inelastic collapse [22]
occurs.

In this paper we will focus on the molecular dynamics
method because this gives us a chance to correlate the
collisional time and the energy dissipation during multi-
particle collisions. We shall introduce a novel mathemat-
ical description of this method taking into account the di-
vision of the collision process into an impact phase, a con-
tact phase and another phase occurring after the contact
phase. We assume that the impact phase and the phase
formed after the contact phase are inﬁnitesimally short
in time. Consequently, we will analyse the well-known in-
teraction laws of the repulsive force in the contact phase
in order to examine several diﬃculties within the colli-
sions. On the base of preliminary results [15] we shall
introduce a novel form of the repulsive force deﬁned un-
der fractional calculus [23]. We will also demonstrate the
basic properties of this force and focus on what happens
with the collisional time and the energy dissipation for
multiparticle collisions. This analysis is necessary in com-
putational simulations of the cluster dynamics. Within
the cluster one may notice non-permanent contact and/or
cohesion phenomena between several pairs of colliding
particles.

form particle shapes. The particles are numbered by the
discrete index i = 1, . . . , np, where np is the total num-
ber of considered particles. We describe an individual
particle through its radius ri (or diameter di), mass mi,
inertia moment Ji, position xi of the mass centre, linear
speed ˙xi and angular velocity ωi. With regard to the
collision of two individual particles we also introduce the
natural function j(i) (j(i) 6= i by assumption) of a par-
ticle i in order to ﬁnd the particle index of a particle in
a set of particles np. Several papers [1, 10, 32] present
diﬀerent algorithms that detect particle collisions, being
dependent on their shapes, and consequently that to ﬁnd
the natural function j(i). For a binary collision we ne-
glect phenomena which cause a change in the mass of
an individual particle. Thus in our discrete model we
do not take into account fragmentation, attrition and
erosion which eventually take place during the collision
process. These phenomena will be the subject of future
investigations.

However, after the contact, which is the second phase
of the collision process, rebound, non-permanent contact
(static contact) or cohesion can arise simultaneously. In
this paper, we will try to model above the phenomena by
introducing a novel mathematical description and a novel
form of the repulsive force into the molecular dynamics
method.

A. Mapping local coordinates onto global ones and
deﬁning the overlap

Starting from the description shown in Fig. 1, let us in-
troduce several deﬁnitions before formulating the motion
equations. First, we assign local coordinates as (ξ, η, ζ)
and global ones as (x, y, z). When we consider a contact
which eventually takes place between two particles then
the normal unit vector eζ j(i) that connects the particle’s
centres of mass reads

xj(i) − xi
xj(i) − xi

=

eζ j(i) =

ζ j(i), ez

ζ j(i), ey

where k · k represents a norm calculated from the rela-
tive coordinate xj(i) − xi. Tangential unit vectors which
operate on a tangent plane (rotated by π
2 to the normal)
become

where k · kx,y represents the norm which is calculated
only in the tangent plane. When a particle hits a wall
we redeﬁne unit vectors (1), (2) and (3) putting xbn(i)
instead of xj(i), where xbn(i) is a point whose coordinates
issue from the line that crosses the particle’s centre of

Let us turn our attention to a set of spherical particles
moving under arbitrary extortion. The spherical shape
of the particle makes only the mathematical description
easier and does not make the model in any way poorer.

tiparticle collisions where an individual particle i collides
with neighbouring particles j(i). Therefore many over-
laps (5) indexed j(i) on the particle i may occur. This
allows us to formulate the motion equations in the right
form.

dinates (x, y, z). To change this to the local system of

move individually. As presented in previous section and
in Fig. 1, the overlap reﬂects the penetration depth of
the particles in a direction which connects the particle’s
centres of mass, pointing from i to j(i). We also intro-

We neglect here any additional expressions necessary to
describe the particle-wall collision. The reader can do
this very easily in the same way as explained previously.
Summarising our considerations, we introduced the
above mathematical description which is necessary for
the formulation of the motion equations and is also nec-
essary for some forms of the repulsive force, acting for
both particle-particle and particle-wall collisions.

B. Motion equations

The molecular dynamics method requires a discrete de-
terministic approach in order to the model motion of an
individual particle. Note that the particle may collide
or lose contact with other particles. Therefore in mo-
tion equations we need to add or reject some forms of
the repulsive force and/or the attractive force in order to
simulate the particle dynamics more realistically. In this
paper we neglect the attractive force and we will con-
centrate only on the repulsive force. Aganist this back-
ground, let us describe the motion of an individual par-
ticle by the following two sets of equations

which takes into account multiparticle collisions. The
above sets of equations exist simultaneously over time
and are dependent on the detection of a contact and the
administration of the repulsive force-overlap path dur-
ing the contact. In both Eqs. (20) and (21) Fl denotes
an arbitrary force which extorts the motion of a parti-
cle, Ml is an arbitrary torque, Pcoll
j(i) is a collisional force
composed of the repulsive and friction forces and acts be-
tween a pair of colliding particles, Pb coll
is also the colli-
j(i)
sional force operating on a particle-wall collision, Mcoll
i,j(i)
and Mb coll
i,j(i) are collisional torques deﬁnitively operating
on particle-particle and particle-wall collision.

We need to deﬁne some of the criteria necessary for
handling the above two sets of equations over the time of

the calculations. It was evidently shown in the previous
subsection that for the beginning of a collision the over-
lap given by expression (5) or (15) is zero. Thus we have
the impact phase. However, some of the criteria for de-
termining when the collision ends are unclear. Correctly
predicting the separation time of two colliding particles
is crucial in the calculation. Most papers assume the par-
ticles separate at the time when the overlap returns to
zero. As proved in [35], the repulsive force changes direc-
tion at the time when the overlap returns to zero. This is
contrary to experimental evidence, also shown and com-
pared with some models in [35], when the force does not
change direction. An attractive force operating in oppo-
site direction to the repulsive force has diﬀerent origins
and is not taken into account here.

At this crucial point of our considerations, we need to
introduce some deﬁnitions in order to predict correctly
the beginning time of a particle collision and the time
when the collision ends. Let us consider the time of cal-
culations t ∈ h0, T i where T represents the total time
in which the calculations are performed. We also deﬁne
the time step ∆t in which we trace the system dynamics.
Follow on from previous explanations we start with some
conditions.

On the base of previous assumptions and deﬁnitions 1
and 2 we introduce the collisional time between a pair of
contacting particles as tcoll
j(i) = te
j(i). This time is
determined by conditions (23) and (24) simultaneously.
In other words, when the overlap changes sign faster than
the repulsive force changes direction or vice versa then
the collision is ﬁnished. If particles are still in contact
then the total contact time is signiﬁcantly greater than
the collisional time. If particles are separated then the
total contact time equals the collisional time. As pre-
sented in the ﬁrst section, the collisional process com-
poses the impact phase, the contact phase and the last
phase formed after the contact phase. Moreover, when
the formulation of the ﬁrst and the last phases is inﬁnites-
imally short in time then the collisional time is predicted

by the contact phase. The contact phase is predicted by
the repulsive force-overlap path. The adhesion or cohe-
sion states extend the contact phase over time to inﬁnity.
In our approach adhesion and cohesion are eventually
formed after the impact and they represent completely
diﬀerent phenomena which deﬁnitely result from the col-
lision process. Generally, when we model impact dynam-
ics we need to consider the balance between the repulsive
force which is a direct reaction to the impact, and the
attractive forces which are a result i.e. cohesion of par-
ticles. Therefore, our collisional time tcoll
j(i) also becomes
the time of relaxation in which the collision process is
stopped and novel states are formed. Most papers ne-
glect this fact and identify the total contact time, which
may increase to inﬁnity, as the collisional one.

Extending our considerations we notice that deﬁni-
tion 4 is suitable for the elastic collisions of particles
because there are no deformations in contacting parti-
cles - the overlap tends to zero faster than the repulsive
In deﬁnition 5 we observe the
force changes direction.
opposite situation - the repulsive force changes direction
faster than the overlap tends to zero. In our approach the
collision process is fully controlled by the repulsive force
except for the situation presented by formula (25) in def-
inition 3. On the basis of deﬁnition 6, which results from
deﬁnition 3, we are able to explain that the local stresses
associated with deformations of contacting particles be-
come suﬃciently large so as to exceed the elastic limit
of the materials to a result plastic ﬂow occurs [12] and
the behaviour of particle adhesion diﬀers from that pre-
dicted by the elastic deformation theory [21]. Adhesion-
induced plastic deformations of contacting materials are
evidently shown in some experiments [28]. Therefore we
have two possible states resulting from the impact: par-
ticle clusterisations when the colliding materials are soft,
and fragmentation of particles when the colliding mate-
rials are hard.

Summarising this subsection we formulated two gen-
eral forms of the motion equations and discussed precisely
how to handle them.

C. Collisional forces, collisional torques and the
fractional interaction law

With regard to motion equations (21) we introduce
a mathematical description of the collisional forces and
torques occurring in such a system. In the normal direc-
tion to the contacting surfaces we apply only a repulsive
force, completely neglecting any attractive forces. In [31]
one can ﬁnd some forms of attractive forces and their
physical meanings.
In a tangential plane we introduce
a system of friction forces and torques. According to the
friction mechanism, the tangential friction force is one
of four types: torsion with sliding friction, sliding fric-
tion, rolling friction or static friction. Torsion friction
occurs when colliding particles diﬀer by their angular ve-
locities in the normal direction ωζ i and ωζ j(i). Torsion

6

with sliding friction is for colliding particles which have
diﬀerent angular velocities in the normal direction and
diﬀerent linear velocities in the tangential plane. Sliding
friction happens when slipping occurs in colliding parti-
cles. When the relative linear velocity of the particles
in the tangent direction reduces to zero, sliding friction
is replaced by rolling friction. If the external forces are
suﬃciently small, the rolling friction reduces the veloc-
ity until particle motion stops and static friction occurs.
Considering the impact dynamics, we implemented the
following mechanism in general form: torsion with slid-
ing friction can change to rolling friction and the rolling
friction tends to static friction. More details concerning
the modelling of torsion, sliding and rolling friction can
be found in [5, 36]. Here we show a description of the
collisional force in global coordinates (x, y, z) as

phasis in this paper is on the impact dynamics the static
friction is only implemented in a simple form. A more de-
tailed model of the static friction state requires analysis
of the tangential displacement and possibly the inclusion
of time dependent eﬀects. According to Fig. 1 we need to
deﬁne the collisional force in the local system of coordi-
nates (ξ, η, ζ). Using a matrix of the base vectors (4) we
introduce transition from the local system to the global
ones as

erating during a collision. As assumed in this paper, we
neglect attractive forces and concentrate only on forms
of the repulsive force. Some forms of the attractive forces
can be found in [8, 31] but the most well-known forms of
the repulsive force are in [4, 13, 33].

On the basis of preliminary results [15] we now intro-
duce a model of the repulsive force in general form called
the fractional interaction law. Thus we have

III. SOLUTION PROCEDURE

Throughout this section we will show how to handle
the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations (20) and

(21) in order to simulate the dynamics of multiparticle
collisions. The above system is mathematically complex,
and therefore requires a numerical approach. An accu-
rate solution to this problem was obtained by integrat-
ing the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations (20) for
particles moving individually by using Numerical Recipe
routines [26]. Tracing the motion of individual particles
over time we need to detect particle collisions in order
to take into account collisional forces and torques in the
system of diﬀerential equations. Using results presented
in [1, 10, 32] we have chosen the linked cell method to
detect a collision.

Note that during particle collisions we need to solve
the system (21) where the fractional interaction law (29)
occurs. In this case we have a system of ordinary diﬀer-
ential equations with a mixture of operators: the integer
derivative of maximal order equals two, the fractional in-
tegral of order −αj(i) and the fractional derivative of or-
der αj(i). Using fractional calculus [23, 30] we will present
discrete forms of the fractional operators which are suit-
able in our algorithm. Let us consider the duration of
a collision over time t ∈ ht0, tnti where t0 represents the
time when the collision starts and tnt is the time when
the collision ends, nt denotes the division of the colli-
sional time t into several time steps. Thus we obtain:
h = tnt−t0
, tl = t0 + lh, for l = 0, . . . , nt. If a function
f (t) is constant within the step h then the discrete form
of the Caputo fractional derivative (31) becomes

denotes the overlap (5). Taking the above assumptions
into account we obtain the discrete form of the Riemann-

the fractional operators makes it possibile to integrate
the system (21) by using any predictor-corrector proce-
dure [26] with correction of the time step h. The correc-
tion of the time step provides measures that allow us to
determine the begin time when particles enter into a col-
lision and the end time of particle collisions. It should
be noted that the begin and end times are determined by
several deﬁnitions presented in the previous section.

Taking formulae (26), (40) into account in calculations
of particle contacts we need to ﬁnd an accurate time
needed to detect the switching between torsion-sliding,
sliding and rolling processes. As described in the pa-
per [36], a simple way to calculate the switching time is
to use a linear approximation method.

Next we consider a problem occurring in the calcu-
lations of friction forces (33), (37) and the torsional
torque (42). When the relative velocity at the contact
point changes from negative to positive or from positive
to negative, it indicates that the signum function sign(x)
changes sign very fast in above expressions. This is not
desirable as it inﬂuences the stability and convergence of
the numerical calculations in a signiﬁcant way. Therefore
we modiﬁed the signum function introducing

result.

IV. RESULTS AND THEIR ANALYSIS

To illustrate the beneﬁts of the fractional interaction
law (29) in the dynamics of arbitrary multiparticle col-
lisions, ﬁrst we will demonstrate how this law operates
in simple cases connected with a one dimensional prob-
lem. First we will simulate a central collision between
two particles. Fig. 2 shows the dynamics of a two-particle
collision, which is represented by some variations in the
overlap kζk (5), the linear relative velocity ˙ζ = u
(14)
and the repulsive force Rζ (29) over time for diﬀerent
levels of the conversion degree α. Here we neglect the
index j(i) because only two particles collide. Moreover,
all vectors are converted to scalar values when a one di-
mensional problem is considered. For the ﬁgure we have
mef f = m1m2
= 7.06858 · 10−6 kg, r1 = r2 = 3 · 10−3 m,
m1+m2
k = 5000 kg
s2 , c = 0.1 kg/s. The initial relative velocity
is set at ˙ζ = 0.5 m
s and three groups of variations in the
conversion degree are taken into account. The ﬁrst group
is for α < 0 (left column), the second is for 0 ≤ α ≤ 1
(middle column) and the third represents α > 1 (right
column). Within the range 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 we observe that
collisional time tc increases when α is increased. It should
be noted that the collisional time is registered when the
repulsive force Rζ reaches zero, as presented in several
deﬁnitions in the previous sections. Therefore, the over-
lap ||ζ|| has some values at the time when a collision
ends and deformations of the particle surfaces are noted.
Analysing the behaviour of the relative velocity ˙ζ over
time we notice that this velocity changes direction for
small values of α, which means thatparticle rebounds
dominate. When α increases we can see that the rela-
tive velocity tends to zero, which means that particles
stick together. In other words, if α = 0, no viscous term
in Eqn. (29) may occur and all the impact energy must
be due to elasticity. In this case the overlap reaches zero
at the same time as the repulsive force reaches zero. If
α = 1, on the other hand, the impact energy is transfered

11

law.

through the viscous term.
Extending our considerations for α > 1 we observe (right
column on Fig. 2) that the repulsive force is not gener-
ated and tends to zero for tc → ∞, and therefore the
overlap increases to high and unrealistic values. More-
over, the relative velocity does not change direction and
particles undergo the next time steps of the calculations.
According to deﬁnition 6, presented in the previous sec-
tion, the fragmentation of particles or permanent cohe-

sion of particles is a direct result of the plastic ﬂow of
their contacting surfaces. The contacting surfaces are
destroyed because deformations of contacting particles
become suﬃciently large so as to exceed the elastic limit
of the materials, and we noticed particle clusterisations.
This process is observed experimentally in [12, 28] and
may be modelled by the fractional interaction law (29).
Next we considered the behaviour of the overlap, relative
velocity and repulsive force for α < 0 (left column on

Fig. 2)). Larger negative values of the conversion degree
α decreases the collisional time. The relative velocity
changes direction but at the end time reaches larger ab-
solute values in comparison to the initial relative velocity.
As this is unrealistic all the solutions for α < 0 are not
taken into account. The aim of this example is to show
the power of fractional calculus where more solutions are
obtained in comparison to classical diﬀerential and inte-
gral operators having integer order. However, we need
to choose which solutions obtained by fractional calculus
are suitable physically.

In Fig. 3 we constructed several mappings for the rel-
ative velocity-overlap (left), force-overlap (middle) and
force-relative velocity (right) where α changes from neg-
ative to positive values. Analysing these mappings we
found a set of criteria necessary to predict diﬀerent states
of particle collisions included in deﬁnitions in the previ-
ous section. It should be noted that small positive values
of α predict particle rebounds when particle deformations
are practically neglected. When α tends to unity we also
observe particle rebounds but particle deformations are
visible and more energy is dissipated. As indicated in
the left chart in Fig. 3, when α is above unity the repul-
sive force is not generated and this indicates instability in
particle collisions. This instability takes the form of par-
ticle fragmentation or permanent clusterisation of parti-
cles after the collision. Therefore the conversion degree
α is a ratio of the impact energy over the speciﬁc energy
needed for the destruction of particle surfaces. This as-
sumption should be validated experimentally, and this is
the aim of our future investigations. Note that when the
physical properties of colliding granular materials and the
impact energy are ﬁxed we still observe diﬀerent values of
energy dissipation after the collision. This can be easily
seen when we compare the particle collisions for smooth
surfaces of particles and for rough ones. The fractional
interaction law can simulate this because the conversion
degree α can change.

˙ζ = 0.5 m

In order to compare the fractional interaction law with
other interaction laws, changes over time of the over-
lap, the relative velocity and the repulsive force for two-
particle collision were presented. We assumed parame-
ters of colliding particles to be r1 = r2 = 3 · 10−3 m,
mef f = 7.06858 · 10−6 kg,
s . Moreover, we as-
sumed the collision time between two colliding bodies the
tc = 10−4 s and the restitution coeﬃcient er = 0.5. These
assumptions are necessary to calculate the set of coeﬃ-
cients required by diﬀerent interaction laws, depending
on the type of interaction law chosen. In Table I we list
all the coeﬃcients. Some of the expressions applied to
calculate the coeﬃcients for linear [4] and hysteretic [33]
laws can be found in [25]. The formulae of the coeﬃ-
cients used in the linear interaction law assumed that at
the end time of a collision the overlap is zero. In Table I
the “linear1” represents the above case. We assumed that
the repulsive force reaches zero at the end time of a col-
lision. Thus we have a set of coeﬃcients called “linear2”
also used for the linear interaction law. For the non-

linear [13] and fractional laws we performed a numerical
test to ﬁnd the values of coeﬃcients which allow us to
keep the assumed collision time and the restitution coeﬃ-
cient in a two-particle contact. It should be noted that we
obtained many sets of coeﬃcients for the fractional inter-
action law. Therefore for this law we establish the spring
coeﬃcient which has the same value as for the linear in-
teraction law. Fig. 4 shows the behaviour of the overlap
(top chart), the relative velocity (middle chart) and the
repulsive force (bottom chart) over time where diﬀerent
interaction laws are taken into account. Analysing this
ﬁgure we can conﬁrmed that the interaction law fulﬁlled
our assumptions concerning the collisional time and the
restitution coeﬃcient. It should be noted that the repul-
sive force changes direction in the linear interaction law
(linear1) for the set of coeﬃcients calculated under the
formulae found in [25]. This shows a deﬁciency in numer-
ical calculations and should be rejected. Some changes
in the values of the above coeﬃcients give satisfactory re-
sults in the linear interaction law (linear2). However, the
repulsive force in the linear interaction law has a value
at the beginning time which is independent on the set of
coeﬃcients used. This is also unrealistic behaviour in the
linear law.
Using diﬀerent interaction laws we observed diﬀerent
overlaps at the end time of a collision. The highest value
of overlap is for the hysteretic law and decreases for the
fractional through the non-linear to the linear one. Note
that for the fractional law we can ﬁnd another set of co-
eﬃcients in order to fulﬁl our assumptions and to obtain
another value of the overlap at the end time of collision.
When we determine all parameters necessary to describe
the dynamics of particle impacts then we obtain some
values of the collisional time and the restitution coeﬃ-
cient for this case. However when we still keep the above
parameters and increase or decrease the surface rough-
ness of colliding particles then we obtain values of the
collisional time and the restitution coeﬃcient diﬀering in
comparison to the previous values. As we did not change
physical properties of this granular material therefore we
have to save the steady value of the spring coeﬃcient in
all interaction laws. Changing only the damping coeﬃ-
cient in the linear and non-linear laws and the unload-
ing slope k2 in the hysteretic law we do not have any
guarantee that we will obtain accurate values of the col-

gree α which causes some changes in the collisional time
and the restitution coeﬃcient. However, this requires
some experimental data involving the impact dynamics
of smooth and rough particles. These data will provide
measures that allow some links to be made between the
experiment and the coeﬃcients of the fractional law.

In order to verify the validity of the interaction laws
for multiparticle collisions, the energies dissipated at each
contact were compared. Here we introduce a measure of
energy dissipation during multiparticle collisions which is
the ratio of the kinetic energy evaluated in time over the
initial kinetic energy. We deﬁne the total ratio of energy
lost through multiparticle collisions as

ε = 1 −

where the superscript 0 refers to the initial kinetic energy
examined at time t = 0 s and nc is the total number of
colliding particles.
We used a set of particles np vertically stacked over a bot-
tom plate as shown in [18, 25]. We assumed the fol-
lowing conditions ri = 0.0015 m, mi = 1.41 · 10−5 kg,
˙xi = −0.5 m
s , for i = 1, . . . , np. Gravity is set at zero.
Taking into account the results presented by [18] we cal-
culated the energy dissipation as a function of the num-
ber of considered particles np, which becomes the num-
ber of colliding particles nc when at the begin time of
the collision the distances between spheres equal zero
l0
j = 0 m, for j = 1, . . . , nc. Note that j = 1 repre-
sents a collision between the ﬁrst particle and the bot-
tom plate and j = nc is a collision between the topmost
particles. We also assume the collisional time between
two colliding bodies tc = 10−4 s and the restitution co-
eﬃcient er = 0.945. These assumptions are necessary
to calculate some coeﬃcients depending on the type of

lisional time and the restitution coeﬃcient reﬂecting the
above cases. This is a disadvantage of the well-known
interaction laws.
In the fractional interaction law we
have an additional parameter called the conversion de-

interaction law chosen. The coeﬃcients represent a colli-
sion between two particles or between a particle and the
bottom plate, where the plate mass is inﬁnite.
Fig. 5 shows the energy dissipation as being dependent
on the number of collisions nc for diﬀerent interaction
laws used in the molecular dynamics method and also in
the event driven method [1, 22]. For linear, non-linear

rials we can easily observe such states, when we con-
sider the collisions for contacting particles with smooth
surfaces and for rough ones. For this simulation we
assumed the following conditions r1 = 0.02 m, r2 =

x5 = [−0.001, 0.1, 0.18] m. Moreover, we consider a situ-
ation where a particle with an initial linear velocity u1 =
[0, 0, −5] m
s collides at diﬀerent moments in time with
particles which initially do not move (uj = [0, 0, 0] m
s , for
j = 2, . . . , 4). Particles do not rotate initially (ωi = 0 1

gravity is set to zero and k = 1000 kg

pair of colliding particles. We also simpliﬁed values of
the friction coeﬀcients putting into Eq. (34) a = 0 and
µs = 0.5 for each pair of colliding particles. Fig. 6 shows

and hysteretic laws we noted the same dependencies as
in [18, 25]. This means that the “detachment” eﬀect oc-
curs. First, we considered the fractional interaction law
for a steady value of the conversion degree αj(i) = 0.0258,
for all binary collisions. In this case we obtained similar
results for the hysteretic and fractional interaction laws.
Thus the “detachment” eﬀect also occurs in the fractional
interaction law for the steady value of αj(i). As written
in [18] the kinetic energy obtained from the event driven
technique is dissipated totally for nc · (1 − er) large. It
should be noted that the basic interaction laws are valid
for a two-particle collisions which are completely inde-
pendent of other collisions. However, in multiparticle col-
lisions we need to include mutual dependencies between
several binary collisions. Taking this fact into account,
we can obtain satisfactory results when the conversion
degree αj(i) changes in relation to the number of collid-
ing particles. This was explained more precisely in [15].

Therefore we propose α
to keep a qualitative agreement with the event driven
method. It should be noted that we cannot estimate cor-
′
rectly α
(nc) by direct comparison with the event driven
technique. We require experimental data involving mul-
tiparticle collisions. This data will provide measures that
allow some links to be made between several coeﬃcients
in the fractional interaction law and the experiment.

The last example simulates the dynamics of ﬁve par-
ticles in three dimensional space for two values of the
parameter α. The ﬁrst value α = 0.01 indicates the

numbered from ”1” to ”5”. This simulation does not
reﬂect the real motion of particles because we neglect ex-
ternal forces, i.e. the gravitational force. We can only
show how the fractional interaction law operates in the
above conditions as being dependent on the conversion
degree α. In the strong repulsive state (α = 0.01) we ob-
serve linear particle trajectories. As α is increased and
reaches the weak repulsive state (α = 0.97) we noticed
diﬀerent particle trajectories in comparison to the previ-
ous state. According to the results presented in Fig. 2
we can say that duration over time of the repulsive force,
which is longer over time for higher values of α, has a sig-
niﬁcant inﬂuence on the particle trajectories.
In order to explain more precisely what happens to par-
ticle trajectories in strong and weak repulsive states, the
velocities of one individual particle were analysed. Fig. 7
shows in global coordinates (x, y, z) the linear and angu-
lar velocities of particle ”1” over time. In this ﬁgure the
dashed lines represent particle velocities in the strong re-
pulsive state, whereas continous lines indicate the weak
repulsive state. We can observe clear jumps in particle
velocities over time for the strong repulsive state. This is

a result of the duration of a collision determined by the
collisonal time between a pair of contacting particles. In
this state we can notice binary collisions because several
collisional times between the diﬀerent pairs of contacting
particles have shortest values in comparison to their sep-
aration times, where particles move individually. How-
ever, in the weak repulsive state we observe continous
changes in particle velocities without the distinction of
any jumps. This means that several collisional times be-
tween the pairs of contacting particles overlap each other.
The binary collisions are not distinguished here.
Moreover, we analysed, in the local system of coordinates
(ξ, η, ζ), the angular velocities over time of particle ”1”,
which collides with the particle ”5”. In the strong repul-
sive state we observe smaller values of ωξ and ωη (these
velocities are angular velocities predicted in the tangent
plane as shown in Fig. 1) in comparison to the weak re-
pulsive state. This means that torsion-sliding friction
dominates in the strong repulsive state, where binary col-
lisions are noted. In the weak repulsive state we observe
that the angular velocities ωξ and ωη have higher val-
ues than in the strong repulsive state. Thus we expect

the torsion-rolling state between particles ”1” and ”5”.
However multiparticle collisions are noted in the weak
repulsive state.

In order to prove where binary or multiparticle colli-
sions occur, some distributions of collisional times over
the duration time of calculations are presented. Fig. 8
presents the sequence of segments of collisional times
over the time of observation for strong and weak repulsive
states. Continous segments represent collisional times for

16

dimensional space. We introduced a novel mathemati-
cal description of this method which takes into account
the division of the collision process into an impact phase,
contact phase and another phase formed after the con-
tact phase. We assumed that the impact phase and the
phase formed after the contact phase are inﬁnitesimally
short in time. We redeﬁned the collisional time so that it
is predicted by the repulsive force-overlap path. On the
base of preliminary results [15] we proposed an expres-
sion for the repulsive force formulated under fractional
calculus. The force can control the energy dissipation
and the collisional time for an individual particle col-
liding with many other particles. In multiparticle colli-
sions we included the friction mechanism needed for the
transition from coupled torsion-sliding friction through
rolling friction to static friction. Therefore our model in-
cludes multiparticle collisions in arbitrary forms. Using
the fractional interaction law one can determine diﬀerent
states of particle repulsions, i.e. strong and weak repul-
sive states. In the strong repulsive state binary collisions
dominate, and torsion-sliding friction is the main friction
mechanism. However, within the multiparticle collisions
rolling friction is observed to be much stronger.
The presented numerical results can be used to realisti-
cally model the impact dynamics of an individual parti-
cle in a group of colliding particles. In order to tune the
model coeﬃcients we require experimental data involving
multiparticle collisions. This data provides measures that
allow some links to be made between several coeﬃcients
in the fractional interaction law and the experiment.

weak repulsion whereas strong repulsion is denoted by the
dashed segments. Each segment representes one binary
collision between a pair of contacting particles, i.e. ”1”-
”3” means the collision between particle ”1” and particle
”3”. Analysing this ﬁgure we observe longer collisional
times for the weak repulsive state in comparison to the
collisonal times for the strong repulsive state. Moreover
the collisional times ovelap in the weak repulsive state,
therefore multiparticle collisions occur.

It is well known that conventional simulation algorithms are ineﬃcient for the statistical descrip-
tion of macroscopic systems exactly at the critical point due to the divergence of the corresponding
relaxation time (critical slowing down). On the other hand the dynamics in the order parameter
space is simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly in this case due to the onset of self-similarity in the associated ﬂuc-
tuation patterns. As a consequence the eﬀective action at the critical point obtains a very simple
form.
In the present work we show that this simpliﬁed action can be used in order to simulate
eﬃciently the statistical properties of a macroscopic system exactly at the critical point. Using the
proposed algorithm we generate an ensemble of conﬁgurations resembling the characteristic fractal
geometry of the critical system related to the self-similar order parameter ﬂuctuations. As an ex-
ample we simulate the one-component real scalar ﬁeld theory at the transition point T = Tc as a
representative system belonging to the 3 − D Ising universality class.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The traditional simulation algorithms of statistical mechanics are proven to be ineﬃcient for the simulation of the
statistical properties of macroscopic systems at a critical point. This is a consequence of the well-known mechanism
of critical slowing down leading to a divergence of the relaxation time, independently of the algorithm used, when
the critical point is reached [1]. Therefore, the generation of an ensemble of conﬁgurations carrying the properties
of the critical system is in practice a very diﬃcult task as the onset of equilibrium is prerequisite. On the other
hand, due to the universal character of the correlations at the critical point, the dynamics of the order parameter,
described eﬀectively through the averaged action [2] or the constrained eﬀective potential [3], acquire a very simple
form [4, 5] reﬂecting the self-similarity of the associated ﬂuctuation pattern. The consequence of self-similarity at
the macroscopic level is at best reﬂected in the fractal geometry of the domains with constant magnetization in an
Ising ferromagnet. However, fractality in the strict mathematical sense is only deﬁned for an ideal critical system
embedded in a continuous space. In real physical systems fractal geometry occurs only partially between some well
deﬁned scales. Therefore, physical fractals, contrary to the corresponding exact mathematical sets, can be deﬁned
also on equidistant lattices facilitating their realization through numerical simulations. On the other hand, a realistic
algorithm generating critical conﬁgurations of a system at its transition point should also reproduce the (partial)
fractal geometry of the critical clusters. There are several ways to produce sets with prescribed fractal dimension
found in the literature [6]. The associated algorithms can either be of stochastic [7] or deterministic nature [8].
However, although fractal geometry is strongly related to critical phenomena, there is, up to now, no algorithm
capable to link directly this geometrical property with the statistical mechanics of a critical system.

The present work attempts a step in this direction. The main goal is to develop an eﬃcient algorithm for the
simulation of a macroscopic system at the critical point. In fact we propose a method able to generate an ensemble
of microstates of the considered system carrying its basic critical properties such as self-similar order parameter
ﬂuctuations and algebraically decaying spatial correlations [9]. Using the representation of the partition function in
terms of the eﬀective free energy at the critical point we proceed within the saddle point approximation. Then we
show that the associated functional measure can be expressed as a summation over piecewise constant conﬁgurations
of the order parameter within domains (clusters) of variable size covering the entire critical system. We use these
conﬁgurations to calculate the ensemble averaged density-density correlation function leading to a power-law form
characteristic of a fractal set. Thus we recover a relation between the fractal geometry of the critical clusters and the
canonical ensemble of critical conﬁgurations describing the statistical properties of the system at the transition point.
The generation of an ensemble of critical conﬁgurations is of relevance for the study of the evolution of a critical

determined critical ensemble is introduced as a set of initial conditions for the corresponding dynamical problem
[10]. Besides, one can also consider the time evolution of a critical system under the constraints of thermodynamical
equilibrium so that the property of self-similarity sustains for an inﬁnitely long time interval. This situation could be

on a critical state [11].

The paper is organized as follows:

II. SADDLE POINT APPROACH FOR SINGLE CLUSTER ϕ-CONFIGURATIONS AT THE CRITICAL
POINT

There are two extreme situations where the division of the whole system to subsystems and the subsequent study of
one of them, is a good approximation. The ﬁrst is when the interactions are very weak so that statistical independence
is valid, and the whole system can be assumed to be constituted by separated building blocks. On the opposite limit, in
a critical system, where the correlations are very strong, we expect the emergence of self-similarity and the formation
of fractal structures. In this case investigation of a small region oﬀers information for the entire system. Thus, at
the critical point, it is natural to consider the partition function ZΩ of an open subdomain Ω of a critical cluster.
Assuming that the order parameter is an one-component real ﬁeld ϕ, ZΩ is given as:

in terms of the eﬀective action:

ZΩ =

δ[ϕ]e−Γ[ϕ,Ω],

expected to be valid at the critical point T = Tc [4, 5]. In (2) δ is the isothermal critical exponent [9]. To calculate the
partition function (1) one may use the saddle point approach developed in [13] where it is shown that the functional
sum in ZΩ is saturated by the summation over the saddle point solutions of the eﬀective action (2). These solutions
encompass power-law singularities. In the sum (1) the only signiﬁcant contribution comes from those saddle points for
which the corresponding singularities lie outside the region Ω. In fact, if the distance of the location of the singularities
from the boundary of the domain Ω increases, the corresponding statistical weight increases too. In this case the
saddle point solutions can be well approximated by constant functions inside Ω [13].

Since in the present work we are mainly interested in the calculation of the density-density correlation function, it

is necessary to extend the saddle point method to the case of the generalized eﬀective action:

cluster. Therefore, the solutions (6),(7) which contribute signiﬁcantly to the system’s partition function can also be
well approximated by a constant function within the cluster.

The saddle point solutions in the higher dimensional case are impossible to be found analytically. However numerical
calculations reveal a similar behavior, that is almost constant conﬁgurations with singularities forming a closed D
1
subspace around the location of the source, which can be handled as described above. Therefore, the summation over
the saddle point solutions in the single cluster partition function, in any space dimension D, can be well approximated
by an ordinary integration over constant ﬁeld conﬁgurations.

The fractal geometry of the critical clusters is revealed through the power-law dependence of the density-density
correlation function which in turn leads to a power-law dependence of the mean “mass” m(R) within a domain of
radius R around ~x0 = ~0:

.

The analysis at the level of one cluster is not suﬃcient for the description of the properties of the entire critical
system. Therefore, after obtaining the set of saddle-point solutions of the generalized action (3), it is necessary to use
it in order to generate an ensemble of conﬁgurations valid for the global system. The systematic way to perform this
extension is explained in detail in the next section.

III. GENERATION OF MULTI-CLUSTER CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE CRITICAL SYSTEM

In order to generate an ensemble of global conﬁgurations for the critical system within the saddle point approach
discussed in the previous section one adopts the following picture: The entire system is composed of weakly correlated
clusters of diﬀerent size up to the correlation length [13] (which at the critical point is expected to be of the order of
the lattice size). Thus, for given number and size of clusters, the partition function of the system can be decomposed
in the product of the partition functions of each cluster. The sum over the microstates in the partition function of
one cluster with given size is calculated through the summation over the corresponding saddle points. To saturate
the summation over microstates in the total partition function one has to sum over the possible number of clusters
as well as the corresponding possible cluster sizes. Therefore, the functional measure of the global partition function
can be expressed as:

A. One Dimensional Case

Our aim is to produce an ensemble of conﬁgurations, leading to a fractal mass dimension dictated by the power-
law form of the density-density correlation of the critical system, in realistic computational times. According to the
saddle point approach, a suitable basis to express the conﬁgurations of the critical system are the piecewise constant
conﬁgurations, where the domains of constant value of the ﬁeld ϕ(x) correspond to diﬀerent clusters. In fact this
coarse-graining procedure clearly neglects any internal structure of the critical clusters. However the entire set of
these conﬁgurations, weighted with the corresponding Boltzmann factor calculated from the eﬀective action, allows
for the deﬁnition of suitable observables at the level of ensemble averaged quantities, reﬂecting the fractal geometry
of the critical system. The main observable used in the present work is the mean “mass” in a domain of radius R,
centered at x0, deﬁned in eq.(10). Therefore, the calculated value of the mass dimension Df = ln m(R)
ln R will serve as a
consistency check for the validity of our procedure. To construct the multi-cluster piecewise constant conﬁgurations
we ﬁrstly perform a random partitioning of the N -site lattice in a random integer number of elementary clusters M of
diﬀerent length. This is achieved using the Random Partition of an Integer n (RanPar) algorithm of [19]. Moreover,
we use the Random Permutation of n Letters (RanPer) algorithm from the same reference, in order to permute and
randomly select one speciﬁc partition. We point out here that this step is one of the most time consuming of the
103. In the end, we come up with a random partitioning of the lattice into
whole procedure, especially for N & 4
×
several clusters, and each cluster consists of a diﬀerent number of lattice sites.

(13)

Continuing, we give a random constant value of the ﬁeld (using a uniform distribution in the interval
ϕmax, +ϕmax]) to the lattice sites within each cluster, and for this piecewise constant conﬁguration we calculate

using periodic boundary conditions. Obviously, the derivative is zero inside each cluster and becomes relevant only
in their edges. The choice of ϕmax, of the lattice spacing α and of the coupling g, will be discussed later.

As a next step we randomly alter the ﬁeld value of the ﬁrst cluster and we recalculate the eﬀective action Γ01. If the
new eﬀective action Γ01 is smaller than the initial Γ00 we accept the new ﬁeld value of the ﬁrst cluster. On the other
Γ00 we compare e(Γ00−Γ01) with a uniformly distributed random number z in the interval [0, 1), and if
hand, if Γ01 ≥
e(Γ00−Γ01) > z we also accept the change, otherwise we reject it. In this way the ﬁeld conﬁguration is weighted by a
factor of e−Γ[ϕ]. We repeat this step changing the ﬁeld value of the second cluster and calculating the new eﬀective
action Γ02, and so on, until we have covered each one of the M clusters. In the end of this Metropolis algorithm [20]
we come up with a new ﬁeld conﬁguration and the corresponding action Γ1 = Γ0M . We repeat this procedure at least
kiter times in order to achieve equilibrium. The equilibration time kiter is deﬁned as the minimum number of steps
O(103)) successive algorithmic
required in order to reach a stationary state, in the sense that variations of ϕ for ns (
steps lead to a standard deviation of the mean value of ϕ and ϕ2 less than 0.5%. The ﬁrst conﬁguration fulﬁlling this
criterion is actually the ﬁrst member of the ensemble of critical conﬁgurations and gets recorded.

≈

Repetition of the whole procedure will form the complete critical ensemble of the ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Our algorithm
allows for the use of a speciﬁc lattice partition more than once, in order to save computational time, since the
partitioning procedure, using RanPar algorithm, as well as the equilibration process are time-consuming. Doing so, the
necessary minimum iteration number liter, separating in time two successive statistically independent conﬁgurations,
kiter
is much smaller than kiter (usually liter
100 ). However, the conﬁguration space of the system is more eﬃciently
covered using diﬀerent lattice partitions, and therefore an optimization is possible leading to the use of the same
partition for 10-50 times for an ensemble of

104 conﬁgurations.

≈

Finally, a comment concerning the choice of the various computational parameters has to be made. Firstly, the

≥

minimum iteration number liter can be calculated as usual in terms of the autocorrelation function G(m):

G(m) =

¯ϕl ¯ϕl+m
h

¯ϕl

¯ϕl+m

i − h

ih

,

(14)

≈

where ¯ϕl is the spatial average of the ﬁeld in a conﬁguration obtained by a single Metropolis step and time averaging
for a large number of Metropolis steps (& 104) is performed. If m∗ is the characteristic decay time of G(m) then we
choose liter

5m∗.

Secondly, we have to ﬁnd ϕmax, which determines the optimal range of ϕ values to be used in the simulation.
Fortunately, there is a physical reason which constrains ϕmax. Due to the potential term in the eﬀective action (2),
the statistical weight of conﬁgurations involving large ϕ values are super-exponentially suppressed. Thus in thermo-
dynamic equilibrium only conﬁgurations with ﬁeld values within a narrow interval around zero will be statistically
signiﬁcant.

ϕ

For every choice of ϕmax we produce a large number (

104) of conﬁgurations and from this ensemble we calculate
i versus i corresponding
the average of the absolute value of the ﬁeld
to each ϕmax is almost constant (with an expected noise that decreases increasing the ensemble population), with
two peaks in the two lattice ends. While ϕmax increases, a shift to larger constant
i values is observed. However,
above a threshold value for ϕmax a saturation takes place. This behavior is expected since for small ϕmax statistically
signiﬁcant ﬁeld values contributing to the partition function are left out of the corresponding sum, while for ϕmax’s
larger than a speciﬁc value, the additional ﬁeld values have vanishingly small contribution suppressed by the weight
e−Γ[ϕ]. So ϕmax can be strictly determined using a lower limit in the variation of the
i vs i dependence. Knowing
ϕmax reduces substantially the computational time as the requisite liter increases rapidly with increasing ϕmax.

Lastly, we have to ﬁx the coupling g and the lattice spacing α. The former can be determined by considering the
D system there is no critical

point in the absence of long range interactions [12]. However, technically, an ensemble of conﬁgurations reproducing
equivalently the density-density correlation of a fractal set with prescribed fractal mass dimension (Df < 1) can be
constructed although having no direct physical interpretation. Concerning the lattice spacing α we have considered
the thermodynamical and the continuum limit investigating the behavior of the term
and α = const
or a
0. In both cases we have observed a smooth behavior, attributed to the used basis of piecewise constant
conﬁgurations, as well as to the the eﬀect of the statistical weight e−Γ[ϕ] of each conﬁguration which favors smoother

achieve self-consistency [10]. Finally, we stress that in our presented results the calculated observables are expressed
in units of α.

With the demonstrated procedure we acquire an ensemble of ﬁeld conﬁgurations generating a random fractal
measure on the lattice as a statistical property after ensemble averaging. This fractal property (9) is not directly
reﬂected in the geometry of their average

The higher dimensional generalization of our algorithm is straightforward, preserving the improved mean ﬁeld
approach using piecewise constant conﬁgurations. For D > 1 we use conﬁgurations consisting of D
dimensional
boxes as basis and the ensemble production is reduced to the Cartesian product of the one dimensional case. Finally,
the decisive test about the proper conﬁguration production will be the calculation of the fractal mass dimension (10),

the linear size of the lattice is reduced, leading to a signiﬁcant decrease of the partitioning algorithm computational
time. For example, the time needed for the partitioning of a 20

D case, we assign a random constant value of the ﬁeld (in the interval [
lattice sites within each cluster, and for this piecewise constant conﬁguration we calculate the D-dimensional eﬀective
action (2), using the corresponding generalized formula of eq. (13). The sum extends to every lattice site using periodic
boundary conditions, and the derivative is calculated using the straightforward D-dimensional generalization. The
value of the coupling g in the 3

the parameters ϕmax, kiter and liter are determined following the corresponding 1
D steps. The only complication
enters in the speciﬁcation of ϕmax, which requires the construction of the plot

action and using the same criteria as in the 1
cluster. We perform these steps until we have covered the whole lattice, and we iterate this procedure kiter times, in
the end of which we record one ﬁeld conﬁguration. Repetition of the above algorithm will form the whole ensemble
of the ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Finally, our comment in the 1

such a treatment is not necessary.

This is the generalized algorithm of producing an ensemble of D-dimensional ﬁeld conﬁgurations generating a

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Using the saddle-point approach introduced in [13] we have been able to develop an algorithm simulating the
critical state of a macroscopic system at its transition point. The method followed here is in close analogy with the
improved mean ﬁeld theory [21] and leads to a successful and computationally eﬃcient description of the geometrical
characteristics of the critical clusters, deﬁning suitable measures to quantify this property. A particularly appealing
issue of the proposed method is that it provides a link between the eﬀective action at the critical point and the
fractal geometry of the formed clusters, overcoming the huge numerical eﬀort needed for the detailed description
of fractal sets. Thus, it is the ﬁrst time, at least to our knowledge, that geometrical characteristics as well as
statistical properties of the critical system, are incorporated in an ensemble of conﬁgurations suitable for the study
of any desired observable at the critical point. The proposed algorithm may be of special interest for the treatment
of systems where the formed critical state is not observable but acts as an intermediate state for the subsequent
evolution of the system. Such a scenario is likely to hold in the collision of two heavy nuclei at high energies [22]
when the formed ﬁreball freezes out near the theoretically predicted QCD critical point.

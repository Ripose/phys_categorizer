We investigate the classical evolution of a φ4 scalar ﬁeld theory, using in the initial state random
ﬁeld conﬁgurations possessing a fractal measure expressed by a non-integer mass dimension. These
conﬁgurations resemble the equilibrium state of a critical scalar condensate. The measures of the
initial fractal behavior vary in time following the mean ﬁeld motion. We show that the remnants of
the original fractal geometry survive and leave an imprint in the system time averaged observables,
even for large times compared to the approximate oscillation period of the mean ﬁeld, determined by
the model parameters. This behavior becomes more transparent in the evolution of a deterministic
Cantor-like scalar ﬁeld conﬁguration. We extend our study to the case of two interacting scalar
ﬁelds, and we ﬁnd qualitatively similar results. Therefore, our analysis indicates that the geometrical
properties of a critical system initially at equilibrium could sustain for several periods of the ﬁeld
oscillations in the phase of non-equilibrium evolution.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The classical dynamics of scalar ﬁeld theory has been extensively studied in the literature. In most investigations
a lattice discretization of the scalar ﬁeld is used, reducing the problem to the study of the dynamics of a system of
non-linear coupled oscillators [1]. The central question in this case is the evolution of the system towards a thermalized
stationary state. In the early days Fermi, Pasta and Ulam [2] have obtained deviations, even for large times, from
the naively expected equipartition of the energy among the diﬀerent oscillators. Through the eﬀorts to explain these
results, it became clear that, for appropriate initial conditions, a variety of periodic solutions (breathers, solitary
waves) [3], deﬁned on the non-linear lattice, exists. Therefore, the choice of the ensemble of the initial conﬁgurations
strongly inﬂuences the long time behavior of the system dynamics. Recent works [4, 5] show that for a random
ensemble of initial conﬁgurations a suﬃciently large system relaxes to the usual equilibrium distribution, but the
corresponding relaxation time strongly depends on the parameters of the theory.

In the present work we reconsider the classical dynamics of a scalar ﬁeld in 1 + 1 dimensions adopting a diﬀerent
point of view: As initial conditions we use an ensemble of scalar ﬁeld conﬁgurations possessing a non-conventional
proﬁle, inspired by the order parameter ﬂuctuations of a critical system at thermal equilibrium. These conﬁgurations
generate a fractal measure on the lattice characterized by a corresponding fractal mass dimension. We do not consider
here the dynamical process responsible for the formation of such a critical state, but we concentrate on its evolution
once it has been formed. Our aim is to investigate the deformation of the initial fractal measure as the system evolves
In particular, we are interested in determining the time scale for
according to the classical equations of motion.
which signatures of the initial fractality survive, and leave their imprint in appropriate observables. We ﬁnd that the
initial geometry is successively deformed and restored again, with a frequency determined by the ﬁeld oscillations.
This behavior seems to be generic, since it is observed for both random as well as deterministic (Cantor-like) fractal
measure. Moreover, we study in detail the inﬂuence of an additional thermalized non-critical scalar ﬁeld, described
initially by conﬁgurations with conventional geometry, coupled to the system, as well as the dependence of the
corresponding characteristic time scales on the parameters of the theory. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our
model to the out-of-equilibrium evolution of an isoscalar condensate formed near the Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD) critical point during a heavy-ion collision experiment.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II is divided in two subsections.

In subsection IIA we present our
model considering a single self-interacting scalar ﬁeld. In IIB we describe the generation of the ensemble of initial
conﬁgurations for a scalar ﬁeld corresponding to a random fractal measure on the lattice with a given fractal mass
dimension. Section III contains the numerical results of the single ﬁeld case and section IV the corresponding results
for the evolution of ﬁeld conﬁgurations initially generating a deterministic fractal measure with Cantor-like structure.
In section V we analyze the dynamics of two coupled scalar ﬁelds. Finally, in section VI we summarize our results
and discuss their relevance to the phenomenology of out-of-equilibrium critical systems.

have absorbed one more parameter by rescaling the ﬁeld as well as the space-time units. Thus, only two parameters
remain in the potential term. We consider the dynamics of the scalar ﬁeld in 1 + 1 dimensions. The corresponding

B. Generation of initial ensemble of σ-conﬁgurations corresponding to a random fractal measure

The absolute value of the σ-ﬁeld introduced in the previous subsection is interpreted as local density, and the
corresponding fractal behavior is described by a fractal measure demonstrated in the dependence of the mean ”mass”
on the distance R around a point ~x0 deﬁned by:

obeying the power law

for every ~x0. Df is the fractal mass dimension of the system [6, 7, 8] and the mean value is taken with respect to the
ensemble of the initial σ-conﬁgurations. The production of a σ-ensemble possessing the fractal measure described in
eqs. (5,6), has been accomplished in [9]. It is based on the observation that a scale invariant free energy of the form:

of the scalar ﬁeld σ, generates piecewise constant conﬁgurations leading to an ensemble possessing fractal mass
dimension (according to the deﬁnition above):

Df =

.

In the following we will use δ = 5 and the dimension D = 1, therefore the corresponding fractal mass dimension is
Df = 5/6. It must be noted that the free energy (7) for D = 3, δ = 5 and g = 2 describes the eﬀective action of the
3D Ising model at its critical point [10].

In practice, to produce critical conﬁgurations on a lattice we use the following algorithm: We perform a random
partitioning of the lattice in elementary clusters of diﬀerent size ξ. Thus, each cluster consists of several lattice
points. Within each cluster the value of σ is assumed to be constant. To obtain the values of σ in the diﬀerent
clusters we use a uniform random distribution. Each σ-ﬁeld conﬁguration is weighted by a factor e−Γ[σ], where Γ[σ] is
calculated for the given conﬁguration, using the coupling value g = 2. We use a Metropolis algorithm [11] to perform a
25000 initial algorithmic steps in order to
random walk in the conﬁguration space of the σ-ﬁeld. We perform ﬁrstly
104) of statistically independent
achieve equilibrium. The σ ensemble is then formed by recording a large number (
σ-conﬁgurations.

With this procedure we acquire an ensemble of ﬁeld conﬁgurations generating a random fractal measure on the
lattice as a statistical property after ensemble averaging. This property is not reﬂected in the geometry of either

parameters A and λ, according to the corresponding form of the potential plotted in ﬁg 2. In ﬁg. 3 we depict the
for these cases. For zero A and λ, the potential term vanishes and the mean value of the ﬁeld remains

constant and equal to a very small value determined by the initial conditions. For non-zero A the ﬁeld oscillates
around the potential minimum and the oscillation amplitude as long as the frequency increase with A for ﬁxed λ.
This is due to the fact that the minimum value of the potential decreases and at the same time the value of σ, for which
the potential minimum occurs, increases (see ﬁgs. 2 and 3). Note furthermore that due to the quadric anharmonic
term in the potential the time mean value of the oscillations is slightly smaller than the potential minimum. On the
other hand, for small λ,
oscillates almost harmonically, and the amplitude together with the minimum decrease
with increasing λ, while the frequency increases. For λ > 1 the oscillations damp relatively fast (the larger the λ
values the faster the rate, as the potential becomes steeper), leading to a stabilization of

As a next step we calculate the evolution of m(x0, ξ) deﬁned previously. As time passes the power-law form of
ξψ(t)) remains, but the corresponding exponent ψ(t) increases, approaching the value ψ(t)
m(x0, ξ) (
1, when the
signs of the initial fractal geometry disappear and a conventional pattern establishes, as is depicted in ﬁg. 5. However,
a more detailed analysis for greater time intervals reveals a remarkable phenomenon. In the solid line plots of ﬁg. 6
we show the evolution of ψ (each ψ value coming from a linear ﬁt). It can be clearly observed that the characteristic
exponent ψ(t) after reaching the value 1, ﬂuctuates and for particular times becomes almost equal to ψ(0) = 5/6.
Thus, the initial fractal measure is restored repeatedly within the considered ensemble. A simultaneous study of this
graph and ﬁg. 3 is illuminating, since we observe that the reappearance of the fractal mass dimension, describing the
initial measure, occurs when the mean ﬁeld value becomes almost zero.

≈

If we interpret the σ-ﬁeld as a system of coupled anharmonic oscillators with initial ﬁeld values around zero and
zero kinetic energy, we expect an almost simultaneous pass from their turning points, due to synchronization. The
energy transfer between the diﬀerent oscillators takes place through the spatial derivative, as can be seen in equation
(3). Therefore, if it is small compared to the other terms (which is the case in general), the oscillators do not mix
signiﬁcantly, and due to their initial zero kinetic energy they roll to their common minimum, they oscillate around it
and then return to their starting position almost in phase and with kinetic energy close to the initial one, i.e close to
zero. So, every time the kinetic energy and the mean ﬁeld value become zero, the system reaches to a state similar
to the initial one, leading to the restoration of the initial fractal measure. On the other hand, when the oscillators
roll away from zero, the geometrical characteristics of the ensemble are changed by the dynamics, since they acquire
large ﬁeld values and large kinetic energy (compared to the initial ones).

In ﬁgs 6b,c,d we can clearly observe this behavior. Moreover, ψ(t) in ﬁgs 6e and f is also easily interpreted since

in these cases, following closely the evolution of the σ mean value, it stabilizes after some reciprocations. Finally, the
behavior of ψ for A = 0, λ = 0 depicted in ﬁg. 6a is also expected since in this case (3) reduces to the simple wave
equation, σ values stay always around zero, i.e around their initial values, and ψ oscillates around a value between
5/6 and 1, namely the signs of the initial fractal geometry are always visible. The dotted line plots of ﬁg. 6 depict

Lastly, in order to have a clearer apprehension of the aforementioned phenomenon, we perform some tests. In ﬁg.
7a and 7b we present the evolution of the system with random initial conditions, prepared choosing the σ value at
each site from a uniform distribution, for A = 1 and λ = 1. The mean ﬁeld value oscillates around the minimum as
before, and the slope ψ which initially is obviously one, corresponding to a non-fractal system, remains equal to 1 as
expected, independently of the ﬁeld motion. Following the arguments referred above, one could say that every time
returns to zero the system enters in a state similar to the initial one, and ψ(t) remains always 1 since the initial
σ
h
state is characterized by ψ(0) = 1. In ﬁgs 7c and 7d we evolve our system using initial conditions corresponding to a
fractal measure with mass dimension ψ(0) = 5/6, but with random non-zero (actually quite large) kinetic energy, for
A = 1, λ = 1. In this case the ﬁnite value of the initial kinetic energy (diﬀerent for every oscillator) forbids the return
of the system to a state close to the initial one, each time the mean value of the ﬁeld passes through zero, suppressing
the approach to the initial fractal state. (Note that due to the large initial kinetic energy the system oscillates around
both minima).

i

Additionally, in ﬁgs 7e and 7f we perform the following scenario: We evolve the initial ensemble, possessing fractal
mass dimension ψ(0) = 5/6, for A = 1, λ = 1, introducing by hand a three orders of magnitude larger coeﬃcient to
the spatial derivative term in the equation of motion. As expected, the enhanced diﬀusion in this case induces very
strong mixing of the oscillators, and as a consequence the system never reacquires the initial fractal characteristics

IV. EVOLUTION OF A SCALAR FIELD CONFIGURATION WITH DETERMINISTIC FRACTAL
MEASURE

In order to acquire a better comprehension of the mechanism of the aforementioned phenomenon, we investigate
the evolution of one Cantor-like scalar ﬁeld conﬁguration. This set up, although not related to critical phenomena, is
enlightening since in this case a direct geometrical interpretation at the level of one conﬁguration is possible, instead
of investigating the statistical fractal properties of an ensemble.

Firstly, we construct a ﬁnite approximation to the 1D Cantor dust of 211 sites, with Hausdorf fractal dimension
Df = 5/6 [6].
In order to transform this fractal set into a ﬁeld conﬁguration deﬁning a fractal measure on an
equidistant lattice we ﬁnd the minimum two-point distance of the set and using it as the lattice spacing we determine

the size of the lattice by dividing the maximum two point distance in the set by the minimum one. In the sites of this
new equidistant lattice that are closer to the locations of the points of the initial Cantor set, we give the ﬁeld value 1,
while in all the others we give the ﬁeld value 0. Thus, we turn out with a ﬁeld conﬁguration in an equidistant lattice,
ζDf in a good precision, where the reference sites x0,i
which by construction has the property
i ∝
(i = 1, ..., 211) are obviously only those with ﬁeld values 1. The averaging now is taken only on the diﬀerent x0,i since
we have only one conﬁguration. The produced σ-ﬁeld conﬁguration is depicted in ﬁg. 8 where the fractal property is
104 sites) equidistant
clear. Note that starting from the initial 211 Cantor lattice, we transited in a much larger (
one.

only diﬀerence is that in the present case only a small subset of the entire lattice is initially described by a fractal
measure with mass dimension 5/6. The remaining lattice sites are occupied by zero ﬁeld values, which initially have

V. TWO COUPLED FIELDS

We are interested in studying the evolution of our system determined by the above equations, taking for the σ-
ﬁeld initial conditions possessing fractal behavior as described in section II, and for the π-ﬁeld conventional initial
conditions, corresponding to an ideal gas at temperature T0. In the next subsection we describe the generation of the
ensemble of 1-d π-conﬁgurations on the lattice, using the algorithm introduced in [12].

B. Numerical Results. Two coupled ﬁelds

We solve equations of motion (11) in 1-D 2000-site lattice following the discretization scheme (4), using for initial
conditions an ensemble of 104 σ and π conﬁgurations satisfying the aforementioned requirements, that is fractal σ
and conventional π (corresponding to dimensionless temperature T0 = 1) conﬁgurations. As in the single ﬁeld case
we focus on the evolution of the

In ﬁgs 12a,b we demonstrate the evolution of the mean σ-ﬁeld and its standard deviation, and in ﬁgures 12c,d the
corresponding quantities for the π-ﬁeld, for A = 1 and λ = 1. The absence of a term linear in π-ﬁeld in the potential
(10), leads to slight oscillations, due to the small initial total energy of the π-ﬁeld, of the mean value
around
zero. The anharmonic character of these oscillations relies on the non-linear form of the equation of motion (11), and
is enhanced relatively to the σ case due to the large variation of the coupling term λ(σ2
1)π. Note however that
although the mean ﬁeld value
remains small, this is not the case for its ﬂuctuations which can become quite large.
On the other hand, as one can see in ﬁgures 12a,b, the corresponding σ quantities do not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the
single ﬁeld case since π-ﬁeld remains small.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work we investigate the evolution of the fractal characteristics of a single or two coupled scalar ﬁelds system,
within the framework of the general σ-model. After a relatively rapid deformation of the initial fractal geometry, we
observe that it is being re-established almost periodically each time the mean value of the σ-ﬁeld returns to zero.
This eﬀect is obtained using both random, as well as deterministic (Cantor-like) fractal set up. The key point for
the occurrence of this behavior is the condition of initial equilibrium. As the system practically consists of coupled
anharmonic oscillators, this condition is expressed through the zero initial kinetic energy for each oscillator, leading
to a synchronous evolution of the entire system. Additionally, the fractal measure characterizing the initial state is
based on the fact that the corresponding ﬁeld conﬁgurations represent ﬂuctuations (with a speciﬁc pattern) around
zero. Thus, each time the oscillators pass through their turning points, associated to zero mean ﬁeld value, in phase,
the initial fractal geometry is being re-established. The above evolution, at least qualitatively, is quite general and
robust for a very wide parametric space.

The scenario analyzed in this paper could be extended to 3 dimensions and serve as a model in order to describe
the evolution of the order parameter ﬂuctuations in a critical system.
In particular it could be used to explore
the non-conventional correlations which are expected to occur during the formation of an isoscalar condensate in a
heavy ion collision experiment. In this case one has to adapt the σ-model Lagrangian in order to describe correctly
the characteristics of the order parameter associated with the 2nd order critical end point of the chiral QCD phase
transition [13]. At the phenomenological level these correlations are expressed through the fractal mass dimension
of the σ-ﬁeld conﬁgurations, determining the statistical properties of the condensate. The dynamics of the system
is similar to the two-ﬁeld case investigated above, provided that the critical system is initially at equilibrium. One
can study the evolution of the initial fractal characteristics of the σ-ﬁeld and the possibility to leave signals at
the detectors, supplying an indication of the phase transition. The discussion of the present work supports this
eventuality since the time average (in order to simulate the experimental conditions) of the periodical deformation
and re-establishment of the initial fractal geometry, will leave a signature. This 3D extension of the present work is
in process [14].

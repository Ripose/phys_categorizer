A new spectral method (S-IEM) for solving the Lippman-Schwinger integral equation is de-

scribed, and its high accuracy is conﬁrmed for several physical situations, such as, the scattering of

an electron from a static hydrogen atom in the presence of exchange, the scattering of two atoms

at ultra low temperatures, and barrier penetration in the presence of a resonance for a Morse

potential. In all cases the S-IEM achieves accuracies several order of magnitude higher than the

methods commonly used for solving the Schr¨odinger equation.

Even though it is known that the errors which arise in the numerical solution of an integral

equation are smaller than the errors in the solution of an equivalent diﬀerential equation, it

is costumary to solve the latter. The reason is that the solution of a diﬀerential equation

by means of ﬁnite diﬀerence methods (such as Numerov of Runge-Kutta) can be expressed

in terms of a recursion relation between solutions evaluated at previous mesh points which

is simple and does not require extensive storage space. By contrast, the discretization of an

integral equation leads to large non-sparse matrices, and hence requires large investments

of computer time and storage space. Therefore the gain in accuracy of the integral equation

formulation is normally oﬀset by a manifold increase in computational time.

A new method for solving the Lippman-Schwinger integral equation, associated with the

diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equation, has been developed recently [1] as an extension of a method

due to Greengard and Rokhlin [2]. It avoids the above-mentioned draw-backs, and has an

accuracy which, for the same number of mesh-points, is far superior to the accuracy involved

in the ﬁnite diﬀerence methods for solving either an integral or a diﬀerential equation. It

is the purpose of this letter to describe this method, to be denoted as S-IEM (for ”spectral

integral equation method”), and compare it with other methods. In what follows we describe

the method for scattering applications, i.e., for positive energy. The case of negative energies

can be treated in a similar fashion [3].

For the case of the the radial, one-dimensional, Schr¨odinger equation

d2/dr2 + k2

ψ = V ψ

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

an equivalent form of the Lippman-Schwinger integral equation most suitable for the S-IEM

method is

ψ(r) = sin(kr) +

G0(r, r′) V (r′) ψ(r′) dr′

Z

where k is the wave number in units of inverse length, V is the potential in units of
inverse length squared which contains the L(L + 1)/r2 singularity , and where G0 is

the undistorted Green’s function.

In conﬁguration space it has the well known semi-

separable form G0 = −(1/k) sin(kr<) cos(kr>). (for negative energies one would have

(1)

(2)

−(1/κ) sinh(κr<) exp(−κr>)).

Our new method has the following features:

a) the largest matrix involved in the calculation is sparse, hence the computational complex-

ity of the S-IEM is comparable to that of the solution of the diﬀerential equation. This is

2

achieved by dividing the radial interval 0 ≤ r ≤ T into M partitions (of variable size), and

by making use of the semi-separable structure of the Lippman-Schwinger integration kernel

K(r, r′) = G0(r, r′) V (r′)

in conﬁguration space. The procedure is as follows: in each partition i, with i = 1, 2, · · · M,

two independent local solutions Yi(r) and Zi(r) are ﬁrst obtained by solving the integral

equation locally, driven by two diﬀerent functions,

(1 − Ki)Yi= sin(kr),

(1 − Ki)Zi= cos(kr).

(3)

In this step the coeﬃcients of the expansion of the functions Yi(r) and Zi(r) in terms of

the Chebyshev polynomials are obtained with high spectral accuracy by using Chebyshev

collocation points in each partition, together with the Curtis-Clenshaw quadrature [4]. It

is to be noted that Eqs. (3) are not the inverse of the Schr¨odinger Eq., otherwise there

would be no gain in accuracy in using the integral equation. Further, the inverse of the

operator (1 − Ki) always exists if the partition i is made small enough, because then the

norm of the operator Ki becomes small in comparison to the unit operator 1. This step is

not computationally expensive, because the number of collocation points in each partition is

prescribed to be small (16, usually), and hence the matrices involved, although not sparse,

are also of small size (like 16 × 16). Next the set of coeﬃcients Ai and Bi needed in each

partition for expressing the global solution ψ(r) in terms of the local ones,

ψ(r) = AiYi(r) + BiZi(r)

(4)

are calculated. The required matrix M (of size 2M × 2M in the case of only one channel)

can be large, but it is band limited (i.e., sparse) with a bandwidth equal to twice the

number of coupled channels, and does not depend on the number of Chebyshev points in

the integration interval [3]. This sparseness property results from the semi-separable nature

of the integration kernel K, as is shown in Refs.

[1], [3]. This part of the procedure also

diﬀers substantially from that of Ref.

[2]. The relationships between the coeﬃcients A

and B follows from Eq. (2) according to which ψ(r) in one partition is related to integrals

of ψ(r) over all the other partitions. The resulting elements of the matrix M are integrals

over products of the known functions sin(kr), cos(kr), V (r), Yi(r) and Zi(r) in each partition,

3

which can be easily and accurately evaluated in terms of the integral properties of Chebyshev

polynomials

b) The scattering boundary conditions can be implemented reliably. This is because the

Greens function incorporates the asymptotic boundary conditions automatically. However,

implementing the appropriate boundary conditions in the multi-channel case for L 6= 0

requires forming linear combinations of the solutions obtained using G0. We show [3] that

the desired linear combination can be obtained without appreciable loss of accuracy, since

the matrix required in the solution for the coeﬃcients has a condition number not much

larger than unity. This means that our various solutions are linearly independent to a high

degree, contrary to what can be the case with the solution of diﬀerential equations.

c) The method is very economical in the total number of mesh-points required in the interval

[0, T ] because in each partition or spectral collocation method uses very few mesh points

(like in the case of Gauss-Legendre integration as compared to Simpson’ integration), and

the required length of each partition can be easily adjusted to optimal size based on the

magnitude of the coeﬃcients of the expansion of the functions Y and Z into Chebyshev

polynomials. When the coeﬃcients of the large order Chebyshev polynomials are less than

a prescribed accuracy parameter ε the length of the partition is adequate, because, due to a

mathematical property of spectral expansions [3], the truncation error of the expansion will

be less than ε . If not, the length of the partition is reduced accordingly.

d) The calculation can be distributed onto parallel processors. This is because the functions

Y and Z, as well as the elements of the matrix M can be calculated separately for each

partition independently of the other ones. This is an important point, since if the number

of channels increases, the number of these quantities increases accordingly.

Property c) is important because, due to the small number of total mesh-points, the

accumulation of machine round-oﬀ errors is correspondingly small. Further, due to the

property that integral equations are numerically more stable than diﬀerential equations, the

accumulation of the inherent round-oﬀ error is smaller than for the numerical solution of

diﬀerential equations. The small accumulation of roundoﬀ errors in comparison to a ﬁnite

diﬀerence method is clearly illustrated in Fig. 1 of Ref. [1]. The spectral property that high

accuracy is reached very rapidly (in principle faster than any inverse power of the number

of mesh-point in a given radial interval) is shown in Fig (1), which compares two diﬀerent

methods for solving the same integral equation for calculating the scattering of an electron

FIG. 1: Comparison of the numerical stability of two methods for calculating the singlet phase

shift for electron-hydrogen scattering, as described in the text. The number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures

on the y-axis is the number of decimal places for which the result remains the same as the number

of meshpoints is increased. S-IEM is the the spectral method described in this paper, and NIEM

is a non-iterative method of solving the same integral equation carried out by Sams and Kouri.

from a hydrogen atom . For that purpose the S-IEM was modiﬁed [5] so as to include the

nonlocal exchange terms required to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle in the Hartree-Fock

formulation. In this test calculation the excited states of the target atom were not included.
The L = 0 singlet phase shift was calculated for the incident momentum k = 0.2 (a0)−1

and T = 50 a0. As the number M of partitions is increased, and accordingly the number

of mesh-points M × 16, the number of stable signiﬁcant ﬁgures in the phase shift increases

very rapidly, illustrating the spectral nature of the S-IEM procedure. By comparison, for a

method employing ﬁnite diﬀerence techniques based on a equi-spaced set of mesh-points, the

number of stable signiﬁcant ﬁgures increases much more slowly [5]. This is illustrated by the

calculation of Sams and Kouri [6] for solving a very similar integral equation non-iteratively

by means of the NIEM method. References to that method, developed in the sixties, can

be found in [5]. The NIEM calculations by the method of Smith and Henry [7] also give an

accuracy of approximately ﬁve signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Another example is the scattering of two atoms at ultra-low temperature. At low ener-

gies a stable method of calculation is required because the long-range part of the potentials

contributes signiﬁcantly to the phase shift, and many channels may still contribute to the

process. A comparison of various methods of calculation for a test case involving two chan-

nels, one closed and one open, for L = 0, was performed [8], and the results are shown in Fig.

2. In all of these calculations the maximum radius T = 500 atomic units (a0 or Bohr), the
diagonal potentials are of the Lenard Jones form C6/r6 + C12/r12, and the coupling between

the two channels is of an exponential form [8]. At small distances, due to the large depth

of the potentials, the wave function oscillates rapidly, and hence it is important to be able

to adjust the size of the partitions accordingly. Since no analytical exact comparison values

exist, the ”error” in the ﬁgure is deﬁned as the absolute value of the diﬀerence between

the result for a given value of the number of mesh points N and the maximum value of N

employed in the particular method. The FEM method is a ﬁnite element method [10] imple-

FIG. 3: Numerical error in the phase shift for resonant scattering from a Morse potential with a

mented by B. D. Esry and carried out by J. P. Burke , Jr [8]; the Gordon method [11] was

implemented by F. E. Mies [8], and LD is a logarithmic derivative method implemented by

the code MOLSCAT [9], [12]. For the LD curve the roundoﬀ errors apparently overwhelm
the truncation errors for a number of mesh points larger than 2 × 105 . The S-IEM again

shows a rapid improvement of accuracy with the number of mesh-points, and it reaches a

somewhat higher stability than the FEM.

Another test of the stability of the S-IEM in a radial domain of negative energy is obtained

for the case of barrier penetration. The potential chosen is an ”inverted” form of the Morse

potential[13] for which analytic results exist for the scattering phase shift [14]. It has a valley

near the origin at r = 0 followed by a smooth barrier, a situation which leads to resonances.

For resonant energies the wave function in the valley region can become very large if the

width of the resonance is suﬃciently small, and in the barrier region this wave function

decreases as a function of distance, a condition which ampliﬁes the numerical errors, since

in the region inside of the barrier the latter tend to increase exponentially. The accuracy

of three methods of calculation for a particular resonance which occurs for an incident

momentum k in the region 1.5071f m−1 < k < 1.5072f m−1 are illustrated in Fig. 3. The

parameters of the Morse potential are given in Fig. 10 of Ref. [14], the maximum amplitude
of the wave function in the valley region at resonance, near k = 1.50716f m−1, is close to

300 (asymptotically it is equal to 1). The error is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the

analytical and the numerical results; the momenta k on the x-axis are given as the excess
over the momentum at the left side of the resonance, k = 1.50710f m−1. The IEM curve is

obtained with the method described in this paper, NUM is a sixth order Numerov method,

also denoted as Milne’s method [15], and the LD curve is obtained with the Logarithmic

Derivative method, implemented by MOLSCAT [16]. The matching radius for the two ﬁnite

diﬀerence methods, LD and NUM, was set at 50 f m, and the corresponding analytical values

were extrapolated analytically from T = ∞ to T = 50 f m by a Green’s function iteration

procedure described in Ref.

[8]. For the more precise IEM calculation that extrapolation

was not accurate enough, and T = 100 was used instead. The extrapolated analytical values

are given in ref. [14].

In summary, a recently developed method for solving the Lippman-Schwinger integral

equation is described and compared with methods based on ﬁnite diﬀerence techniques and

a ﬁnite element method. It is found that the code MOLSCAT is not designed for obtaining

high accuracy, and that the new S-IEM is considerably more stable than ﬁnite diﬀerence

methods, making it a good candidate for performing complex atomic physics calculations in

conﬁguration space.

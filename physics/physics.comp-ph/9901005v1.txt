The aim of this work is to ﬁnd numerical solutions for diﬀerential equations by expanding
the unknown function in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and solving a system of linear
equations directly for the values of the function at the extrema (or zeros) of the Chebyshev
polynomial of order N . The solutions are exact at these points, apart from round-oﬀ com-
puter errors and the convergence of other numerical methods used in connection to solving
the linear system of equations. Applications to initial-value problems in time-dependent
quantum ﬁeld theory, and second order boundary-value problems in ﬂuid dynamics are pre-
sented.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind of de-
gree n, Tn(x), satisfy discrete orthogonality relationships
on the grid of the (N+1) extrema of TN (x). Based on this
property, Clenshaw and Curtis [1] have proposed almost
forty years ago a quadrature scheme of ﬁnding the inte-
gral of a non-singular function deﬁned on a ﬁnite range,
by expanding the integrand in a series of Chebyshev poly-
nomials and integrating this series term by term. Bounds
for the errors of the quadrature scheme have been dis-
cussed in [2] and revealed that by truncating the series
at some order m < N the diﬀerence between the ex-
act expansion and the truncated series can not be big-
ger than the sum of the neglected expansion coeﬃcients
{ck, m < k ≤ N } [3]. This is a consequence of the fact
that the Chebyshev polynomials are bounded between
±1, and if the expansion coeﬃcients are rapidly decreas-
ing, then the error is dominated by cm+1Tm+1(x) and
smoothly spreads out over the interval [−1, 1].

Based on the discrete orthogonality relationships of the
Chebyshev polynomials, various methods of solving lin-
ear and nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations [4] and
integral diﬀerential equations [5] were devised at about
the same time and were found to have considerable ad-
vantage over ﬁnite-diﬀerences methods. Since then, these
methods have become standard [3]. They rely on expand-
ing out the unknown function in a large series of Cheby-
shev polynomials, truncating this series, substituting the
approximation in the actual equation, and determining
equations for the coeﬃcients. It has been argued, how-
ever [6], that it is better to compute directly the values

of the functions rather than the Chebyshev coeﬃcients.
The two approaches are formally equivalent in the sense
that if we have the values of the function, the Chebyshev
coeﬃcients can be calculated.

In this paper we use the discrete orthogonality relation-
ships of the Chebyshev polynomials to exactly discretize
various continuous equations by reducing the study of
the solutions to the Hilbert space of functions deﬁned on
the set of (N+1) extrema of TN (x), spanned by a dis-
crete (N+1) term Chebyshev polynomial basis. In our
approach we follow closely the procedures outlined by
El-gendy [6] for the calculation of integrals, but extend
his work to the calculation of derivatives. We also show
that similar procedures can be applied for a second grid
given by the zeros of TN (x).

The paper is organized as follows: In Section II we re-
view the basic properties of the Chebyshev polynomial
and derive the general theoretical ingredients that allow
us to discretize the various equations. The key element
is the calculation of derivatives and integrals without ex-
plicitly calculating the Chebyshev expansion coeﬃcients.
In Sections III and IV we apply the formalism to obtain
numerical solutions of initial-value and boundary-value
problems, respectively. We accompany the general pre-
sentation with examples, and compare the solution ob-
tained using the proposed Chebyshev method with the
numerical solution obtained using the ﬁnite-diﬀerences
method. Our conclusions are presented in Section V.

II. FUNDAMENTALS

The Chebyshev polynomial of the ﬁrst kind of degree n

is denoted Tn(x) and is given by the formula

Tn(x) = cos(n arccos x) .

Explicit algebraic expressions for Tn(x) are obtained from
the recurrence

T0(x) = 1 ,
T1(x) = x ,

Tn+1(x) = 2xTn(x) − Tn−1(x) .

The polynomial Tn(x) has n zeros in the interval [−1, 1],
which are located at the points

xk = cos

π(k − 1
2 )
n

(cid:18)

,

(cid:19)

k = 1, 2, . . . , n .

(2.1)

In the same interval the polynomial Tn(x) has n + 1 ex-
trema located at

˜xk = cos

πk
n (cid:19)

,

(cid:18)

k = 0, 1, . . . , n .

(2.2)

At all of the maxima Tn(x) = 1, while at all of the minima
Tn(x) = −1.

The Chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal in the in-
terval [−1, 1] over a weight (1 − x2)−1/2. The Chebyshev
polynomials also satisfy discrete orthogonality relation-
ships. These correspond to the following choices of grids:

and replacing the problem of solving a system of dif-
ferential or integro-diﬀerential equations by the problem
of ﬁnding the solution of a system of equations for the
Chebyshev expansion coeﬃcients [3]. However, in this
paper we will follow [6] and show how to directly com-
pute the values of the functions at the grid points rather
than the Chebyshev expansion coeﬃcients.

It is important to stress that our goal is not to ap-
proximate a function f on the interval [−1, 1], but rather
to approximate the values of the function f correspond-
ing to a given discrete set of points like those given in
Eqs. (2.1, 2.2). Using the orthogonality relationships,
Eqs. (2.3, 2.4), we have a procedure of ﬁnding the exact
values of the unknown function (and any derivatives or
antiderivatives of it) at either the zeros or the local ex-
trema of the Chebyshev polynomial of order N . The only
limitations are those due to inherent round-oﬀ computer
errors, or the convergence of other numerical methods
used in connection with the Chebyshev expansion.

An arbitrary function f (x) can be approximated in the

interval [−1, 1] by either one of the two formulae

f (x) =

ajTj(x)

(2.5)

• If xk (k = 1, 2, . . . , N ) are the N zeros of TN (x)

lae (2.5) and (2.6) are exact at x equal to xk given by
Eq. (2.1), and at x equal to ˜xk given by Eq. (2.2), re-
spectively.

Derivatives and integrals can be computed exactly at

values of the matrix elements Sij and Dij are readily
available from Eqs. (2.9, 2.12), while the elements of the
matrices ˜S and ˜D can be derived using Eqs. (2.11, 2.13).
Note that since T0(x) = 1, its derivative is equal to zero,
and hence the sums in (2.9) and (2.11) start at j = 1.
A consequence of this fact is that the matrices D and ˜D
are always singular.

Finally, the formulae (2.5, 2.14, 2.15) and (2.6, 2.16,
2.17), respectively, can be generalized by allowing the
function f to be approximated on an arbitrary interval
[a, b] instead of [−1, 1]. This is done by performing the
change of variable

˜S[a,b] [f (x)] =

tion f (x), its derivative and integral, at the coordinates

Thus, one can calculate integrals and derivatives based on
the Chebyshev expansions (2.5) and (2.6), avoiding the
direct computation of the Chebyshev coeﬃcients (2.7) or

III. INITIAL-VALUE PROBLEM

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

El-gendy [6] has extensively shown how Chebyshev ex-
pansions can be used to solve linear integral equations,
integro-diﬀerential equations, and ordinary diﬀerential
equations on the grid (2.2) associated with the (N+1)
extrema of the Chebyshev polynomial of degree N . To
summarize these results, we consider ﬁrst the initial value
problem corresponding to the second-order diﬀerential
equation

′′

y

(x) + p(x) y

(x) + q(x) y(x) = r(x) ,

(3.1)

for the case of the grid (2.2), respectively. The elements
of the column matrix [f ] are given by either f (xk), k =
1, . . . , N or f (˜xk), k = 0, . . . , N . The right-hand side of
Eqs. (2.14, 2.16) and (2.15, 2.17) give the exact values
−1 f (t) dt and the derivative f ′(x) at
of the integral

(3.2)

It is convenient to replace Eqs.(3.1) and (3.2) by an in-
tegral equation, obtained by integrating twice Eq. (3.1)

3

and using the initial conditions (3.2) to choose the lower
bounds of the integrals. Solving an integral equation
rather than the diﬀerential one also allows us to use the
matrices S ( ˜S) instead of the matrices D ( ˜D) which are
singular, and therefore we are able to address a larger
class of problems. Equations (3.1) and (3.2) reduce to
the integral equation in y(x)

can be by presenting an example related to the calcu-
lation of scattering eﬀects in the large N expansion of
scalar quantum electrodynamics [8], and compare with
results obtained using traditional ﬁnite-diﬀerences meth-
ods. Without going into the details of that calculation, it
suﬃces to say that the crucial step is solving the integral
equation

kind. Using the techniques developed in the previous
section to calculate integrals, the integral equation can

Ai j = δi j + [ ˜S]i j p(xj ) + [ ˜S2]i j [q(xj ) − p

Here the function g(x) is deﬁned by

and Q(t, t′) are complex functions, and the symbols Re
and Im denote the real and imaginary part, respectively.

where by D∗(t, t′) we denote the complex conjugate of

domain t′ ≤ t.

By separating the real and the imaginary parts of
D(t, t′), Eq. (3.6) is equivalent to the system of integral
equations

Then, the solution of the integro-diﬀerential (3.5) subject
to the initial values (3.2) can be obtained by solving the
system of N linear equations (3.4), where the matrices A
and C are now given by:

The ﬁrst equation can be solved for the real part of
D(t, t′), and the solution will be used to ﬁnd Im{D(t, t′)}
from the second equation. This also shows that whatever
errors we make in computing Re{D(t, t′)} will worsen
the accuracy of the Im{D(t, t′)} calculation, and thus,
Im{D(t, t′)} is a priori more diﬃcult to obtain.

The ﬁnite-diﬀerence correspondent of Eq. (3.6) is given

D(i, j) = D0(i, j) − 2

We will not show any new numerical evidence of the
accuracy or convergence of the Chebyshev expansion. In-
stead we will try to illustrate how powerful this method

where, ek are the integration weights corresponding to
the various integration methods on the grid. For in-
stance, for the trapezoidal method ek is equal to 1 ev-
erywhere except at the end points, where the weight

4

is 1/2. Note that in deriving Eq. (3.8), we have used
the anti-symmetry of the real part of D(t, t′) which gives
Re{D(t, t)} = 0.

Correspondingly, when using the Chebyshev expansion
with the grid (2.2), the equivalent equation that needs to
be solved is

D0(i, j) = D(i, j) + 2

[ ˜S]ik Re{Q(i, k)} D(k, j)

conditions of the problem, and write y = y0 + ǫ, with ǫ
being a variation obeying null boundary conditions. We
then solve for the perturbation ǫ such that the boundary
values remain unchanged.

Let us consider the second-order ordinary diﬀerential

equation

In this case the unknown values of D(t, t′) on the grid
are obtained as the solution of a system of linear equa-
tions. Moreover, the Chebyshev expansion approach has
the characteristics of a global method, one obtaining the
values of the unknown function D(i, j) all at once, rather
than stepping out the solution.

In Figs. 1 and 2 we compare the exact result and the
ﬁnite-diﬀerence result corresponding to the trapezoidal
rule scheme for a case when the problem has a closed-
form solution. We choose

D(t, t

) = sin(t − t

As we are interested only in the values of D(t, t′) for
t′ ≤ t, we depict the real and imaginary parts of D(t, t′)
as a function of the band index τ = i(i − 1)/2 + j, with
j ≤ i, used to store the lower half of the matrix. Given
the domain 0 ≤ t ≤ 6 and the same number of grid points
(N =16), the result obtained using the Chebyshev expan-
sion approach can not be visually distinguished from the
exact result – the absolute value of the error at each grid
point is less than 10−5. The worse results are obtained
for t′ ≪ t. As expected we also see that the errors made
on Im{D(t, t′)} by using the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method are
a lot worse than the errors on Re{D(t, t′)}. As pointed
out before, this is due to the fact that the equation for
Re{D(t, t′)} is independent of any prior knowledge of
Im{D(t, t′)} while we determine Im{D(t, t′)} based on
the approximation of Re{D(t, t′)}.

IV. BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEM

A slightly diﬀerent approach is needed for solving
boundary-value problems. Note that the course of ac-
tion taken in the preceding section, namely converting a
diﬀerential equation into an integral equation, will not
work in the context of a boundary-value problem. In or-
der to introduce the boundary conditions, we need to use
a perturbational approach, where we start with an ini-
tial guess of the solution y0 that satisﬁes the boundary

No restriction on the actual
form of the function
f (y′(x), y(x), x) is implied, such that both linear and
non-linear equations are included. We assume that y0(x)
is an approximation of the solution y(x) satisfying the
boundary conditions (4.2). Then we can write

y(x) = y0(x) + ǫ(x) ,

where the variation ǫ(x) satisﬁes the boundary conditions

g(ǫ(a), ǫ

(a)) = 0 ,

h(ǫ(b), ǫ

(b)) = 0 .

′

′

We now use the Taylor expansion of f (y′(x), y(x), x)
about y(x) = y0(x) and keep only the linear terms in
ǫ(x) and ǫ′(x) to obtain an equation for the variation
ǫ(x)

Using the Chebyshev representation of the derivatives,
Eqs. (2.9, 2.11), and depending on the grid used, we solve
a system of linear equations (3.4) for the perturbation
function ǫ(x). The elements of the matrices A and C are
given as

Aij = [D2]i j + p(xi) [D]i j + q(xi) δi j ,
Ci = r(xi) ,

i, j = 1, 2, . . . , N

for the grid (2.1), and

Aij = [ ˜D2]i j + p(˜xi) [ ˜D]i j + q(˜xi) δi j ,
Ci = r(˜xi) ,

i, j = 1, . . . , N − 1

for the grid (2.2). Note that if q(x) = 0, the matrix A is
singular, and we have a problem ﬁnding numerical solu-
tions of the linear system of equations. Therefore we are
only addressing the special case of boundary equations
for which the function q(x) is not identically zero.

The iterative numerical procedure is straightforward:
Starting out with an initial guess y0(x) we solve Eq. (4.3)
for the variation ǫ(x); then we calculate the new approx-
imation of the solution

ynew
0

= yold

0 + ǫ(x)

(4.4)

and repeat the procedure until the diﬀerence ǫ(x) gets
smaller than a certain ε for all x at the grid points.

It is interesting to notice that this approach can work
even if the solution is not diﬀerentiable at every point of
the interval where it is deﬁned (provided that the lateral
derivatives are ﬁnite). As an example, let us consider the
case of the equation

′

x y

(x) − y(x) = 0 ,

(4.5)

which has the solution y(x) = |x|. In Fig. 3 we compare
the numerical solution for diﬀerent values of N on the
interval [−1, 1]. We see that for N = 64 the numerical
solution can not be visually discerned from the exact so-
lution. Of course the numerical solution will always have
a continuous derivative at x = 0, but for all practical
purposes, we obtain a very good representation of the
exact solution. Moreover, Eq. (4.5) is a good example
of a situation when it is desirable to use an even, rather
than an odd, number of grid points, in order to avoid any
direct calculation at the place where the ﬁrst derivative
y′(x) is not continuous.

We apply the perturbation approach outlined above to
a couple of singular, nonlinear second-order boundary-
value problems arising in ﬂuid dynamics. The ﬁrst ex-
ample [9]

In both cases we are seeking solutions y(x) on the interval
[0, 1], corresponding to the boundary conditions

y(0) = y(1) = 0 .

(4.8)

Then, we choose y0(x) = sin(πx) as our initial approxi-
mation of the solution. Given the boundary values (4.8),
we see that the function f (y′(x), y(x), x) exhibits singu-
larities at both ends of the interval [0, 1]. However, since
the variation ǫ(x) satisﬁes null boundary conditions, we
avoid the calculation of any of the coeﬃcients at the
singular points no matter which of the grids (2.1, 2.2)
we choose. We consider the case when the above prob-
lems have the closed-form solution y(x) = x(1 − x), with
λ = 1/2 in Eq. (4.6). In Fig. 4 we compare the exact
result with the numerical solutions obtained using the
Chebyshev expansion corresponding to the grid (2.1).

The last example we consider arises in the study of
ocean currents, speciﬁcally the mathematical explanation
of the formation of currents like the Gulf Stream. Then,
one has to solve a partial diﬀerential equation of the type

∂2
∂y2 + a(x, y)

∂
∂x (cid:21)

u(x, y) = g(x, y)

(4.9)

subject to null boundary conditions. To illustrate how
the method works in two dimensions, we consider the
case of a known solution u(x, y) = sin(πx) ∗ sin(πy), de-
ﬁned on a square domain [0, 1] × [0, 1] with a(x, y) = 1,
and compare the results obtained via a Chebyshev ex-
pansion versus the results obtained via a standard ﬁnite-
diﬀerences technique. We choose the function u0(x, y) =
xy(1 − x)(1 − y) as our initial guess. In Fig. 5 we plot
the exact result versus the ﬁnite-diﬀerence result corre-
sponding to the same number of points (N =8) for which
the proposed Chebyshev expansion approach is not dis-
tinguishable from the exact result. The number of iter-
ations necessary to achieve the desired accuracy is very
small (typically one iteration is enough!), while the ﬁnite-
diﬀerence results are obtained after 88 iterations, and
even though the code reports having satisﬁed the re-
quired convergence criteria, the result is still oﬀ the ex-
act result. Of course, the grid can be reﬁned by using a
larger number of mesh points. Then, the number of iter-
ations increases linearly for the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method,
while the number of iterations necessary when using the
Chebyshev expansion stays pretty much constant. Our
contention is not that by using the Chebyshev expansion,
we will always be able to obtain the desired result after
only one iteration. However, the number of necessary
iteration is comparably very small and does not depend
dramatically on the number of grid points. This can be
a considerable advantage when we use a large number of
grid points and want to keep the computation time to a
minimum.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented practical approaches to the numer-
ical solution of initial-value and second-order boundary-
value problems deﬁned on a ﬁnite domain. For a given
problem this method can be used also as an initial test to
scout the character of the solution. Failure of the Cheby-
shev expansion method presented here should tell us that
the solution we seek can not be represented as a polyno-
mial of order N on the considered domain. Then more
speciﬁc investigation tools are needed.

The Chebyshev grids (2.1) and (2.2) provide equally
good ways of discretizing a continuous problem, the
grid (2.1) allowing one to avoid the calculation of func-
tions at the ends of the interval, when the functions have
singularities at these points. The fact that the proposed
grids are not uniform should not be considered by any
means as a negative aspect of the method, since the grid
can be reﬁned as much as needed. The numerical solu-
tion in between grid points can always be obtained by
interpolation. The Chebyshev grids have the additional
advantage of being optimal for the cubic spline interpo-
lation scheme [11].

The Chebyshev expansion provides a reliable way of
computing the integral and derivative of a non-singular
function deﬁned on a ﬁnite domain. For example, if both
the solution of an initial-value problem and its derivative
are of interest, it is better to transform the diﬀerential
equation into an integral equation and use the values of
the function at the grid points to also compute the value
of the derivative at these points from (2.15,2.17).

Let us conclude by noting that the procedures pre-
sented here can be applied to solving multidimensional
equations or system of equations in a straightforward
manner. We intend to apply a similar approach to
the problem of ﬁnding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of a given operator (say solving the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation) and compare the results with stan-
dard matrix diagonalization and iterative methods. This
work will be presented in a future paper.

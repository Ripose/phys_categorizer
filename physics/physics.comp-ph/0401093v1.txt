INTRODUCTION

The ﬂow of complex ﬂuids near interfaces is governed by a subtle interplay between the fast microscopic dynamics
within a small localised region of the system close to the interface and the slow dynamics in the bulk ﬂuid region.
This scenario is encountered in a wide variety of applications ranging from nanotechnology (nanoﬂuidics) and other
industrial processes (such as wetting, droplet formation, critical ﬂuids near heated surfaces or crystal growth from
a ﬂuid phase) to biological systems (for example, membranes or biomolecules near interfaces). The dynamics of
these systems depends on the intimate connection of many diﬀerent spatio-temporal scales: from the nanoscale to
the microscale and beyond. Realistic simulations of such systems via standard classical molecular dynamics (MD)
are prohibitive, while continuum ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) cannot describe the important details within the interfacial
region. In view of this fact, the ﬁeld of computer simulation is now faced with the need for new techniques, which
bridge a wider range of time and length scales with the minimum loss of information. A hybrid particle-continuum
approach provides a resolution to this dilemma. A hybrid algorithm retains all the atomistic detail within the
relevant localized domain and couples this region to the continuum hydrodynamic description of the remainder of the
system. Indeed hybrid algorithms for liquids can be expected to provide a powerful tool for the fast growing ﬁeld
of nanoﬂuidics in micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and our ongoing contributions have been recognized by
the nanoscience community (R. Delgado-Buscalioni and Coveney 2003a) as oﬀering a promising simulation technique
with nanotechnological applications.

Hybrid algorithms for solids (Abraham et al. 1998) and gases (Garcia et al 1999) were the ﬁrst to be fully developed
in the literature. As expected in most theoretical descriptions of matter, the hybrid description of the liquid state is
the most challenging one. The general procedure is to connect the particle domain (P) and the continuum domain (C)
within an overlapping region comprised of two buﬀers: C→P and P→C (see ﬁgure 1). Within the P→C buﬀer the
particle dynamics are coarse-grained to extract the boundary conditions for the C-region. The most complicated part
of any hybrid scheme is the C→P coupling where the microscopic dynamics need to be reconstructed to adhere to
the prescriptions given by the continuum variables. Moreover, in doing so the unphysical artifacts thereby introduced
should be minimized (following Occam’s razor).

In this paper we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of the hybrid modelling of liquids. In §II we start by
presenting an overview of the hybrid scheme and some preliminary topics such as the inherent constraints on the
continuum time step and the spatial-grid size. Section III discusses several implementations of the temporal-coupling.
The C→P coupling scheme is then explained in §IV for the general case of mass, momentum and energy. We illustrate
this important part of the scheme by reproducing the three hydrodynamic modes (shear, sound and heat) governing
the relaxing ﬂows in an inﬁnite medium. Section V is devoted to the P→C coupling, based on a ﬁnite volume method
solving the ﬂow within the C domain. Some comments on the eﬀect of noise on the accuracy of the scheme are made.
The full method is used in §VI to solve the problem of shear ﬂow driven by oscillatory wall motion in a nano-slot.
Finally, conclusions and future directions for this research are described in §VII.

II. OVERVIEW

2

The domain decomposition deployed in our hybrid scheme is depicted in ﬁgure 1. Within domain P the ﬂuid is
described at the atomistic level via Newtonian dynamics. The position of the N (t) atoms at time t inside P is updated
each ∆tP time interval using a standard MD scheme. The present calculations were done with a Lennard-Jones (LJ)
ﬂuid. Throughout the ongoing discussion all quantities are given in reduced Lennard Jones units:
length σ, mass
m, energy ǫ, time (mσ2/ǫ)1/2 and temperature ǫ/kB. We refer to Hoheisel 1996, for the estimated physical values
of the LJ parameters for several substances (as an example, for a simple molecular ﬂuid as N2, σ ≃ 0.35nm and
ǫ/kB ≃ 100K).

The rest of the computational domain (C) is described by the Navier-Stokes equations. The ﬂuid variables at C are
the densities of the conserved quantities for which the equations of motion in conservative form are ∂Φ/∂t = −∇ · JΦ
with Φ = {ρ, ρu, ρe} and JΦ = {ρu, ρu + Π, ρu e + Π · u + q} standing for the mass, momentum and energy ﬂuxes
respectively. Here ρ is the density, u the local velocity, e the speciﬁc energy, Π = P 1 + τ the stress tensor which
contains the pressure P and the viscous tensor τ (for a Newtonian ﬂuid) and q = −κ∇ · T , the heat ﬂux by conduction
expressed via Fourier’s law. These continuum equations may be solved via standard CFD methods. Alternatively, for
low-Reynolds number ﬂows (Re ≤ O(10)) the equations can be solved analytically (Delgado-Buscalioni & Coveney
2003b), as is done in the tests presented in §IV.

The kind of information to be transferred in the overlapping region has been the subject of some discussion. The
ﬁrst attempts in the literature (Delgado-Buscalioni & Coveney 2003b and references therein) considered the transfer
of momentum in steady shear ﬂows and proposed a matching procedure based on the continuity of velocity across
the overlapping region. This sort of coupling strategy may be referred to as “coupling-through-state”. An alternative
formulation of the information exchange for liquids based on matching the ﬂuxes of conserved quantities (to/from P
and C) was proposed by Flekkøy et al. 2000. These authors considered steady shear ﬂows with mass transfer. In
subsequent work by Delgado-Buscalioni & Coveney (2003b) the ﬂux-coupling scheme was generalized to enable transfer
of mass, energy and momentum (along both transversal and longitudinal directions). Delgado-Buscalioni & Coveney
2003b also present a comparative study of the coupling-through-ﬂuxes and coupling-through-state schemes for ﬂows
involving energy transfer (longitudinal waves). It was shown that the coupling-through-ﬂuxes scheme provides the
correct physical behaviour, while the coupling-through-state scheme does not guarantee positive entropy production.
Consequently the coupling of ﬂuxes is of central importance in our hybrid scheme (see §IV and §V).

III. TEMPORAL COUPLING

In general there are three times involved in the coupling scheme: the MD time-step ∆tP , the time-step for the
C-solver ∆tC (>> ∆tP ) and the averaging time ∆tav, which are presented below as outline two possible strategies for
merging the time-evolution of C and P. The information transfer (from C→P and P→C) is updated over each time
interval, ∆tC . As stated above, the P→C coupling consists ﬁrstly of a coarse-graining procedure. In particular, for
any particulate quantity, Φi, the spatial average over each P→C cell of volume VP C (= A∆XP C , in ﬁgure 1) is deﬁned
as Φ(R, t) = Σi∈VP C Φi/NP C, where R is the position of the cell in the coarse-grained coordinates and NP C is the
number of particles inside VP C . The time average also needs to be local with respect to the coarse-grained dynamics.
To that end, the microscopic quantities are sampled over a time interval ∆tav which is treated as an independent
parameter of the simulation:

hΦi (R, tC ) =

tC

∆tC Z

tC −∆tav

Φ(R, t)dt.

(1)

The magnitudes ∆tC and ∆tav are constrained by several physical and numerical prerequisites quoted in Table 1.

There are essentially two ways to deal with the coupling of time within the hybrid scheme: sequential coupling
or synchronized coupling. The diagrams in ﬁg. 2 illustrate two possible choices for these time-coupling strategies
starting from given initial conditions. In the sequential coupling scheme, both P and C are ﬁrst moved to t = ∆tC
using the initial conditions. The C→P coupling is performed ﬁrst at t = ∆tC and the P system is advanced to
t = 2∆tC ∼ 300∆tP . The averaged P-information collected over time interval ∆tav = 2∆tC within the P→C
cell is then transferred to the C domain, giving the required boundary condition to advance C towards the same
time t = 2∆tC. This procedure is suited for serial processing. More reﬁned versions of sequential coupling can be
constructed to perform averaging over times ∆tav greater than ∆tC .

In the synchronized coupling scheme both domains advance in time independently until a certain instant at which
both C→P and P→C information transfers are exchanged. This scheme is suitable for parallel processing because the
P and C domains are being solved concurrently. We note that in this case the averaged information from P transferred

TABLE I: Constrains on the coarse grained time and length scales within our hybrid MD-CFD scheme. Condition C.1 ensures
the local thermodynamical equilibrium at the averaging region: the coarse-graining time ∆tav and grid-spacing ∆x needs to be
larger than the collision time τcol and the mean free path λ, respectively. In C.1 τcol and λ are estimated by the hard-sphere
approximation. Condition C.2 is needed to resolve the fastest ﬂow characteristic time τf low and the spatial variation of any
physical variable Φ over the control cell |Φ−1 dΦ/dx|∆x. Depending on the ﬂow behaviour, in C.2, τf low may stand for the
period of the oscillatory ﬂow f −1 or for the diﬀusive time L2
x/ν, etc. The accuracy condition in eq.(C.3) ensures that the signal-
to-noise ratio of the transversal momentum ﬂux in a ﬂow with shear rate γ is greater than one (similar kind of relationships
can be derived for the longitudinal momentum and energy ﬂuxes). The conditions C.1, C.2 and C.3 are applied within the
P→C cell. The last condition, C.4, ensures the stability of the numerical (explicit) scheme used for time-integration of the C
ﬂow. The characteristic velocity of the ﬂow (on one grid space) is denoted by uf low.

at any of these times is obtained during the previous time interval ∆tav. This fact introduces a delay of O(∆tav/2) in
the C ﬂow. Hence, it is important to ensure that ∆tav is about O(10−1) times smaller than the fastest physical time
of the ﬂow process (see Table 1).

IV. CONTINUUM-TO-PARTICLE COUPLING AND ITS VALIDATION

The generalized forces arising from ﬂuxes of mass, momentum and energy measured from the C ﬂow are to be
injected into the particle system at the C→P cell. Table 2 summarizes how each ﬂux contribution arising within C is
translated into the P domain.

Mass continuity is ensured by inserting or extracting particles at a rate given by eq.

(T.1) in Table 2. The
convection of momentum is determined by the product of the rate of particle insertion s and the average velocity of
the incoming/outgoing particles hv′i. By injecting eq. (T.1) into eq. (T.2) it is easily seen that convection balance
requires hv′i = u. New particles are therefore introduced with velocities sampled from a Maxwellian distribution
at temperature T and mean velocity u. On the other hand, the local equilibrium h¯vi = u ensures that the average
velocity of any extracted particles is equal to that of the continuum prescription

Viscous and pressure forces are introduced via external forces acting on the particles at P→C. An important issue
, over the individual particles. We refer to
is to decide how to distribute the overall force in eq. (T.3),
Flekkøy et al. (2000) and Delgado-Buscalioni & Coveney (2003b) for a full discussion. Although in general the force
to be felt by each particle i within the P→C cell can be distributed according to the particle positions (see Flekkøy
et al. 2000), we have adopted a ﬂat distribution F ext
i = AΠ · n/NP C because it provides by construction, a correct
rate of energy dissipation in eq. (T.5) (see Delgado-Buscalioni & Coveney 2003b). Using eq. (T.1) it is seen that
the balance of advected energy in eq. (T.4) implies hǫ′i = e. The energy of each particle is composed of kinetic and
i /2 + ψi({r}N ). The speciﬁc energy of the continuum is e = u2/2 + 3kT /(2m) + φ (here φ is
potential parts, ǫi = v2
= u2/2 + 3kT /(2m) is ensured by inserting the
the excess potential energy). The balance of kinetic energy
new particles with the proper Maxwellian distribution. The balance of the potential energy requires a more diﬃcult
condition
= φ to be satisﬁed. When inserting a new particle, this involves ﬁnding a precise location within
the C→P cell with the desired potential energy. To solve this problem in a fast and eﬀective way we have constructed
an algorithm for particle insertion called usher (Delgado-Buscalioni & Coveney 2003c). In order to ﬁnd the site
with the desired energy within the complex potential energy landscape, the usher algorithm uses a variation of the
steepest descent algorithm including an adaptable displacement. For densities within the range ρ = [0.4 − 0.8], the
usher scheme needs around 8−30 iterations, each one involving the evaluation of a single-force. The usher algorithm
can be also applied in other problems involving particle insertion, such as grand-canonical molecular dynamics.

Finally, eq. (T.6) in Table 2 determines the rate of heat transfer into P by conduction. This energy can be injected by
reproducing a non-isothermal environment within the C→P cell. To that end we have implemented a set of (typically
2-3) Nos´e-Hoover thermostats (NHT) separated by a distance d with temperatures diﬀering by ∆T = [∇T ·n] d, where
∇T is the C-temperature gradient at C→P.

The decay of transversal and longitudinal waves is an excellent test for the validity of our proposed the C→P
coupling as they comprise the whole set of hydrodynamic modes: shear, sound and heat waves. For these tests we
implemented a set-up consisting of a P region of length Lx (with periodic boundary conditions in y and z directions)

surrounded by two C domains. We initially imposed on the P system a sinusoidal (x- or y-) velocity proﬁle along
the x direction. By extracting the initial amplitudes of the spatial Fourier components of all the hydrodynamic
quantities it is then possible to trace the entire time-evolution of the relaxing ﬂow using linear hydrodynamics. In
particular, this permits us to calculate at any time the generalized forces to be inserted within the C→P cell. The
time evolution of the spatial Fourier components of the P-variables is ﬁnally compared with the analytical expressions.
Such kinds of comparisons are shown in ﬁgures 3 and 4, for the case of a relaxing shear wave and a longitudinal wave,
respectively. The excellent agreement obtained indicates that the C→P coupling protocol can be used for capturing
fast and low-amplitude ﬂows, such as those governed by sound, shear or heat waves.

The entropy perturbation, shown in ﬁg. 5, was calculated from the temperature and density perturbative ﬁeld. The
results clearly show that using only one thermostat per C→P cell (denoted by 1-NHTCP , in ﬁgs. 3 and 4) leads to
negative entropy production. The pure exponential decay of heat due to diﬀusion is only recovered when the correct
(averaged) heat ﬂux is connected to each C→P cell; in ﬁgs. 4 and 5 we present a result with two thermostats per cell
(2-NHTCP ). This result conﬁrms that the coupling-through-ﬂuxes scheme is the correct matching procedure.

V. PARTICLE-TO-CONTINUUM COUPLING: FINITE VOLUMES AND FLUCTUATIONS

Within the P→C cells the information coming from the particle dynamics is coarse-grained to provide boundary
conditions at the “upper” C-level. In §II we introduced the averages needed to produce such information. At the
P→C interface the C region receives the averaged particle-ﬂuxes as open-ﬂux (von Neumann) boundary conditions.
The averaged mass, momentum and energy particle-ﬂuxes through the P→C interface are constructed as follows,

A. Hybrid ﬁnite volume: boundary conditions

Let us now illustrate how these ﬂuxes can be injected into the C domain in the framework of the ﬁnite volumes
method (Patankar 1980). The ﬁnite volumes method is ideally suited to our scheme because it exactly balances the
ﬂuxes across the computational cells. Its principle is simple. Brieﬂy, the computational domain (C) is divided into

cells of volume Vl whose size and location is given by the nodes of a speciﬁed mesh, {Rl}, l = {1, ..., Mc}. Integrating
the conservation equation ∂Φ/∂t = −∇ · JΦ over each computational cell (say the cell H in ﬁg. 1) one obtains,

VH Xf
where Af stands for the area of the face f and nf is the outwards normal surface vector. The volume integral of the
transient term of the conservation equation has been approximated by VH times the explicit time derivative of the
value of the integrand at the cell centre, halfway between the surfaces: ρH ΦH . Equation (5) yields a set of ordinary
diﬀerential equations (ODE’s) involving the ﬂow variables at each cell face, f . The set of equations is closed for the
ﬂow variables at the cell centre by expressing the ﬂuxes at the interfaces JΦ,f in terms of diﬀerences of ﬂow variables
at neighbouring cell centres, via the constitutive relations.

Let us consider the momentum ﬂux balance for the low Reynolds number ﬂow of an incompressible and isothermal
ﬂuid driven by diﬀusion of y-velocity along x direction: u = u(x)j.
In this case J · n = P i − η(du/dx)j, where
the surface vector of the P→C surface is n = i. Let us consider an isobaric environment and restrict ourselves to
the transfer of transversal (y) momentum, governed by the momentum ﬂux J ≡ J · j = −ηγ and the shear rate
Integrating along the cell H (see ﬁg. 1), using a ﬁrst order space discretisation of the stress (e.g.
γ ≡ du/dx.
Jw = −η(uH − uW )/∆x) and an explicit time integration scheme, one obtains

un
H = uH(1 − 2r) + ruE + ruW ,
where the subscripts H denote the set of cell centres H = {1, M }, and the symbols E (east) and W (west) denote
variables measured: x = E(= H + 1) and x = W (= H − 1). The time instant is denoted by uH = u(xH , t) and
H = u(xH , t + ∆tC ) and r ≡ ν∆t/(∆x2). with ν = η/ρ the kinematic viscosity. In order to guarantee the numerical
un
stability of the explicit scheme in eq. (6), the size of the (smallest) control cell inside the C region ∆x and the time
step ∆t are related through r ≤ 1/2, which corresponds to the grid-diﬀusive-velocity uf low = ν/∆x in the Courant
condition C.4 of Table 1. In solving eq. (6) we used a uniform grid with a typical value of ∆x ∼ 0.5.

(6)

In order to impose the boundary condition one needs to determine the velocity within the outer cells: at the
rightmost x = xM+1 = Lx and at the leftmost boundary (inside the P→C cell, see ﬁg. 1) x = x0 = lC − ∆x/2. At
xM+1 = Lx there is a rigid wall which moves at a velocity uwall(t) and provides the Dirichlet boundary condition
uM+1 = uwall(t). The hybrid formulation is applied at the left boundary x0 = lC − ∆x/2. To evaluate the outer
velocity uW = u0 we impose the balance of momentum ﬂux across the w surface at x = lC. This means that the
continuum ﬂux evaluated at x = w is made equal to the corresponding averaged particle ﬂux hjiw = −η(¯uH −uW )/∆x.
The outer velocity to be inserted in eq. (6) is then uW = ¯uH + hjiw∆x/η. The velocity ¯uH is evaluated as a linear
combination of the continuum uH(= u1) and the average particle velocity hviH at x1 = lC + ∆x/2:

By inserting eq. (7) into eq. (6) one obtains the velocity at the boundary cell

¯uH = (1 − α)uH + αhviH .

un
H = uH (1 − r) + r uE +

+ αr (hviH − uH ) .

hjiw∆t
ρ∆xH

The reason for the choice of ¯uH in eq. (7) now becomes clear. It introduces the last term on the right hand side
of eq. (8) which acts as a forcing term ensuring velocity continuity by gently driving the continuum velocity to the
corresponding particle average uH = hviH . The strength of the velocity coupling is maximal when α = 1 and is absent
if α = 0. The idea of using a hybrid gradient (arising for any α 6= 0 in eq. (7)) arose from the outcome of calculations
performed at very low shear rates (γ < 10−2). Using α = 0 one obtains a velocity discontinuity at P→C which is
of the same order of magnitude as the ﬂuctuations of the mean instantaneous velocity within the overlapping region.
At low shear rates this means substantial relative diﬀerences in the C and P velocities, < v >H −uH)/uH ∼ O(1).
This problem is solved by introducing a small velocity coupling in the continuum scheme, with a small value of
α ∈ [0.2, 0.5], which drives the continuum velocity to the average particle velocity in a time of O[∆x2/(να)]. To check
any inﬂuence of the velocity coupling term in eq. (8) on the ﬂux balance, we performed simulations of the Couette
ﬂow at diﬀerent shear rates and compared its average over time with the time averaged momentum particle ﬂux. The
results showed that, in average, the velocity coupling term is vanishingly small so it does not introduce any extra ﬂux
in the coarse-grained time scale.

B. The eﬀect of ﬂuctuations: shear stress

In our scheme, the ﬂuctuating nature of the ﬂuxes introduced into the C region at P→C imposes a limitation on
our ability to resolve the ﬂow ﬁeld, as also arises in experiments and full MD simulations. This limit is determined by

6

signal-to-noise ratio becoming smaller than one. A theoretical expression for the amplitude of the stress ﬂuctuations
can be obtained (Delgado-Buscalioni et al. 2003), providing a relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio and the
coarse-grained time and space scales ∆tav and VP C . Table 1 contains the condition to ensure an averaged shear force
larger than its variance. It is clear that in weak steady ﬂows it is always possible to increase the signal-to-noise ratio
by enlarging ∆tav. Nevertheless, in a general space and time-dependent ﬂow, the sizes of the averaging windows in
space and time (VP C and ∆tav) are bounded above by the minimum wavelength and characteristic time which need
to be treated within the ﬂow. Such requirements on spatial and temporal ﬂow resolution are also quoted in Table 1.

VI. OSCILLATORY WALL FLOW

In order to test the applicability of the full hybrid scheme under unsteady ﬂows, we have considered the ﬂow of an
incompressible and isothermal ﬂuid between two parallel walls in relative oscillatory motion. This set-up is widely
used to investigate the reological properties of complex ﬂuids attached to surfaces, as polymer brushes (see C.M.
Wijmans & B. Smit (2002) for a recent review). These systems are good examples of the sort of applications of the
hybrid scheme, which can treat the complex ﬂuid region by MD and the momentum transfer from the bulk by CFD.
A similar set-up can be also used in the simualation of nanotechnological process. For instance, Stroock et al. (2002)
showed that the mixing of solutions in low Reynolds number ﬂows in microchannels can be enhanced by introducing
bas-relief nano-structures on the ﬂoor of the slot. In our test ﬂow, the simulation domain is 0 ≤ x ≤ Lx and it is
periodic along y and z directions. The particle domain occupies the region x < lP , and it includes the LJ liquid
and the atomistic wall composed of two layers LJ particles at x ≤ 0. The continuum domain comprises the region
x ∈ [lC , Lx]. The sizes of the simulation domains were within the nanoscale Lx ∼ 50σ, and lP ∼ 15σ, while the width
of the overlapping region, lP − lC , was set to arround 5σ. The ﬂow is uniquely driven by the oscillatory motion of the
x = Lx wall along the y direction, meaning that the mean pressure is constant throughout the domain and there are
no transfers of mean energy or mass in the x direction (perpendicular to the P→C surface). Therefore the mean ﬂow
carries transversal momentum by diﬀusion only, and the equation of motion for the y-velocity is ∂u/∂t = ν∂2u/∂x2,
with boundary conditions u(0, t) = 0 and u(L, t) = uwall(t) = umax sin(ωt). This equation can be solved analytically
(H. Schliting 1958; C.M. Wijmans & B. Smit 2002). The ﬂow proﬁle has a maximum amplitude at the moving wall
and the momentum introduced by its motion penetrates into a ﬂuid layer of width δ ∼
πν/f . Beyond this layer
the ﬂow amplitude tends to zero diﬀusively as it approaches the other wall held at rest. Therefore, the maximum
shear rate attained inside the momentum layer is of order γ ∼ umax/δ. Inserting this relation into the signal-to-noise
condition (C.3 in Table 1), we ﬁnd

Equation (9) means that in order to attain a signal-to-noise ratio larger than one, the mean kinetic energy per unit
volume of the ﬂow integrated over the averaging time ∆tav needs to be larger than the corresponding energy due to
ﬂuctuations over the period of the mean ﬂow. It is important to mention that at low enough frequencies (f > ν/L2),
there is suﬃcient time for momentum to be spread by diﬀusion over the whole domain. In such situations the correct
condition is given by the signal-to-noise condition (C.3 in Table 1) with γ ∼ umax/L2.

As indicated by condition C.2 in Table 1, in order to solve for the temporal variation of the ﬂow it is required that

. For kBT = 1.0, ρ = 0.8
∆tavf ≥ O(0.1). Inserting this condition into eq. (9) one obtains umax > 5
and VP C = O(100) the above inequality yields umax > 0.5. We performed oscillatory shear simulations for values
of umax above, close to and below the threshold given by eq. (9). As shown in ﬁg. 6a, calculations made at large
ﬂow amplitudes are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution. In ﬁgure 6b we present results for the same
density and temperature (ρ = 0.8 and T = 1) and a wall velocity umax = 0.5 right at the accuracy limit predicted by
(9). The averaging time was chosen to be ∆tav = 10. As shown by the instantaneous velocity within the P→C cell,
the noise amplitude is nearly equal to the ﬂow amplitude and its time-averaged value shows traces of ﬂuctuations.
Figure 6c corresponds to the same velocity and density but at a larger temperature T = 4. This case is below the
accuracy limit (given by C.3 in Table 1) where forces arising from thermal ﬂuctuations dominate the hydrodynamic
ones.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

We have presented a hybrid continuum-particle scheme for moderate-to-large ﬂuid densities which takes into account
mass, momentum and energy exchange between a domain described by discrete particle Newtonian molecular dynamics

7

(P) and an interfacing domain described by continuum ﬂuid dynamics (C). The coupling scheme is applied within
an overlapping region comprised of two sub-cells where the two-way exchange of information is performed: C→P
and P→C. We have shown that the coupling-through-variables scheme (which simply ensures continuity of variables
within the overlapping region) is not suﬃcient to guarantee positive entropy production. However, by generalizing
the coupling-through-ﬂuxes scheme proposed by Flekkøy et al., 2000 to energy and mass transfer we ﬁnd that the
correct decay of shear, sound and heat waves is obtained.

We are now deploying the present scheme to study the dynamics of a tethered polymer under shear ﬂow. The
polymer and its local environment are treated via MD, while the shear ﬂow imposed on the outer domain is treated
via the ﬁnite volume CFD method. In the future, we plan to apply our hybrid scheme to the study of membrane
dynamics.

Enhancements to the present hybrid algorithm are under investigation. In the scheme described here the energy
ﬂux balance is ensured only over time averages. We are currently studying alternative schemes which exactly balance
this ﬂux. From a numerical standpoint, we plan to implement the P→C coupling in conjunction with a ﬁnite volume
CFD solver in 3D.

Also, the present scheme can be easily adapted to couple molecular dynamics with another mesoscopic scheme that
takes into account hydrodynamic ﬂuctuations. This sort of hybrid scheme could be used in applications where the
ﬂuctuations are relevant (microﬂuidics, ﬂuids near critical point, etc...). An important condition for the interfacing
mesoscopic scheme is that it needs to be fully consistent with thermodynamics. Also important is that the transport
coeﬃcients of the mesoscopic model should be adjustable to represent the correct coarse-grained dynamics of the
selected working ﬂuid. Natural candidates are the Lagrangian schemes involving Voronoi tesselation (Flekkøy et
al. 2000a) or the Smooth Particle Dynamics model and related mesoscopic techniques (Espa˜nol 2003). The lattice
Boltzmann (LB) method is another possible candidate to interface with the MD domain. This model has been already
used in multiscale modelling (Succi et al 2001). Nevertheless, the problem with LB methods at present is that there is
no truly reliable thermohydrodynamic model other than for single phase ﬂow. Energy conservation remains unsolved
and most models are athermal; even the thermohydrodynamic lattice-BGK models for the ideal gas are vastly over-
determined and get the temperature dependence of the viscosity wrong (Boghosian and Coveney 1998). Therefore
the hybrid scheme proposed here could only be interfaced with the lattice Boltzmann model in certain applications
involving isothermal and incompressible single phase ﬂows.

A longer term goal of this research is to develop a ﬂexible, componentized, hybrid coupling environment into which
any molecular dynamics and any continuum ﬂuid dynamics codes may be inserted. This will require considera-
tion of electrostatic forces and, therefore, an additional conserved quantity, the electric charge, whose ﬂux coupling
will requires use of Poisson-Boltzmann solvers. Moreover, such multiscale hybrid schemes are attractive candidates
for eﬃcient deployment on computational grids, a feature now under investigation with the RealityGrid project
(www.realitygrid.org).

FIG. 6: Mean molecular velocities within the overlapping region for several oscillatory-wall shear ﬂows applied to a LJ ﬂuid;
umax is the maximum wall velocity and f its frequency. (a) Flow corresponds to umax = 10, f = 0.01 and T = 1.0; we plot the
instantaneous particle velocity at P→C and the time-averaged particle velocity (along ∆tav = 1) at C→P; (b) corresponds to
umax = 0.5, f = 0.01 and T = 1.0; (c) to umax = 0.5, f = 0.01 and T = 4.0. In all cases ρ = 0.8, the extent of the periodic
directions are Ly = Lz = 9, while VP C = ∆x Ly Lz = 178. In (b) and (c) we show the P→C mean velocity (instantaneous and
time-averaged velocity with ∆tav = 10); dashed lines are the analytical hydrodynamic solutions of the imposed shear ﬂows. All
quantities are given in reduced LJ units.

The rural-urban migration phenomenon is analyzed by using an agent-based computa-
tional model. Agents are placed on lattices which dimensions varying from d = 2 up to
d = 7. The localization of the agents in the lattice deﬁne their social neighborhood (rural
or urban) not being related to their spatial distribution. The eﬀect of the dimension of
lattice is studied by analyzing the variation of the main parameters that characterizes
the migratory process. The dynamics displays strong eﬀects even for around one million
of sites, in higher dimensions (d = 6, 7).

1. Introduction

The rural-urban migration is a very important phenomenon which occurs in devel-
oping economies. In our previous work, see Ref. 1, we analyzed such a phenomenon
using an agent-based computational model, considering the rural-urban migration
as a discrete choice problem with social interaction.2 The migratory decision was
modelled taking into account the pressure caused by the diﬀerent earnings between
rural and urban sectors and the neighborhood inﬂuence. The inﬂuence caused by
neighbors was modelled like in the Ising model in a two-dimensional lattice in the
presence of an external ﬁeld.

Simulations in this model show some emergent properties which are consistent
with historical data of developing countries, namely: a transitional dynamics char-
acterized by increasing of population fraction living at urban area and per capita
income, followed by equalization of expected wages between rural and urban sectors
(Harris-Todaro equilibrium condition) and urban concentration. In this paper we
extend this analysis to study the behavior toward equilibrium and its properties in
d-dimensional lattices, 3 ≤ d ≤ 7, instead of d = 2 in Ref. 1.

2. The benchmark model

In this section we present the general equilibrium structure of a two-sector less
developed economy set in Ref. 1 to study the rural-urban migration process.3,4
We also review the formalization of the social interaction modelled by an Ising
like model to as proposed in Ref. 1. These results will be taken to carry out the
generalizations of subsection 3.1.

2.1. The general equilibrium structure of a rural-urban economy

There are two productive sectors considered: urban and rural. The urban sector is
formed by ﬁrms which are specialized in the production of manufacturated goods
whereas the rural sector is formed by farms which produce agricultural goods.

The production of the manufacturing sector is given by5

where Nu is the amount of workers of the urban sector. ξ1 > 0 and α > 0 are
parametric constants.

The equilibrium wage of this sector is

Ym = ξ1N α
u ,

wm = ξ2N α−1

,

u

where ξ2 > 0 is a parametric constant.

The aggregated production of the rural sector is given by

Ya = ξ3(N − Nu)φ,

where N is the total number of workers of the economic system. ξ3 > 0 and φ > 0
are parametric constants.

The equilibrium wage is

where ξ4 > 0 is a parametric constant.

The terms of trade between these sectors 6,7 is measured by the price p:

wa = ξ4p(N − Nu)φ−1,

p = ρ

γ

,

Ym
Ya (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where ρ > 0 and γ > 0 are parametric constants.

Given the equilibrium urban unemployment rate, u, as determined in Ref. 1,
using Eqs. (1) and (2) one can calculate the state of the urban sector. In a similar
manner, the rural sector has its state calculated by using Eqs. (3), (4) and (5).
The complete deduction of the equations of state of both sectors are done in Ref.
1. Typical values for parameters mentioned above are u = 0.10, ξ1 = 144.75, ξ2 =
112.59, ξ3 = 500.00, ξ4 = 150.00, α = 0.70, φ = 0.30, ρ = 1.00, γ = 1.25 and
β = 3.00.

2.2. The sectorial migration model

The migration process was modelled by an agent-based computational model. The
decision of migrating or not is considered taking into account the diﬀerence of
expected wages between the sectors, called deterministic private utility, and the
inﬂuence that individuals suﬀer by the group they are included in, called determin-
istic social utility.2,8,9 As mentioned before, only discrete choices are allowed, so
each worker has it state deﬁned by σi ∈ {−1, +1}, where σi = −1 represents a rural
worker and σi = +1 represents an urban worker.

As mentioned above, during the decision process each worker takes into account
explicit and observable incentives and the inﬂuence of their social neighborhood.
Then, the total (private and social) utility is given by

Hi = K [(1 − u)wm − wa] σi + J

σiσj,

(6)

Xj∈ni

where K > 0 and J > 0 are parametric constants.

The probability that each workers reviews his/her sectorial decision is given by
the activity a deﬁned in Ref. 10. This parameter guarantees that only a fraction of
the total population review their decision becoming potential migrants. The proba-
bility that a potential migrant becomes an actual migrant is given by a cumulative
distribution:

P ri =

1
1 + e−βHi ,

(7)

where β > 0 is a parametric constant which measures the heterogeneity of agents.
The probability that a worker i migrates or not depends on the probability
calculated in Eq. (7). Then, the higher the value of the total utility, Eq. (6), the
higher the probability that the worker does not change his/her sectorial decision.

3. Properties of the transitional dynamics

In our previous work we analyzed the transitional dynamics of the rural-urban
migration in a two-dimensional lattice. The determination of the macrostate of the
system in each time step can be done by using Eqs. (1-5). In this section we will
brieﬂy review some of these resultsa.

The main variable that characterizes the migratory process is the fraction of
workers allocated in the urban sector, nu, also called urban share. In Fig. 1 one
can see the urban share as function of time. The three curves of this Figure are
plotted for diﬀerent combination of the parameters K and J of Eq. (6). The set
(J = 0, K > 0) plotted in Fig. 1 means that agents review their sectorial position
taking into account only the deterministic private utility, ignoring the neighborhood
interaction. The second case, (J > 0, K > 0), both of the eﬀects mentioned before
are considered in the reviewing process. In the last case, (J > 0, K = 0), only
neighborhood inﬂuence in considered in the reviewing process what make this case
an unrealistic one.

3.1. Transitional dynamics in d-dimensions

The simulations for d-dimensional lattices were carried out placing workers in lat-
tices of dimensions d = 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. This dimensional change in the lattice
will modify the number of nearest neighbors that each worker will have and this
relation will depend on the dimension of the lattice:

nb = 2d;

(8)

where nb is the number of nearest neighbors and d is the dimension of the lattice.
In all simulations the initial urban share is nu = 0.2, what means that 20% of the
workers are located in the urban sector. All others parameters of the system are the
same, if not, it will be mentioned.

In Fig. 2 the urban share is plotted as function of time. In this ﬁgure one can
see that the increasing of the dimension of the lattice will accelerate the migratory

process provoking an overshooting in the urban share as observed in developing
economies. On the other hand, smaller dimension takes the system to reach equilib-
rium faster than higher dimension lattices. In Eq. (8) one can see that the variation
in the size of the lattice will change the amount of nearest neighbors that each
worker is connected. Therefore, as the whole parameters are kept constant to all
simulations, the behavior of the curves in Fig. 2 are strictly related to the number
of nearest neighbors in d-dimensional lattices.

The statement above is proved in Figure 3 where all the simulations were carried
out as in Fig. 2 but keeping parameter J = 0. The parameter J, in Eq. (6), set null
means that the interaction among neighbors is not being considered in the reviewing
process done by the agents. Then, this ﬁgure clearly shows that migratory process
is being modiﬁed due the number of neighbors, i.e., the social interaction is playing
more important role in the decision of migrate or not.

Figures 4 and 5 are plotting of expected urban wage wm and the rural wage wa,
respectively. Once again, the only parameter which is changed is the dimension of
the lattice. In these ﬁgures is shown that the curves of wm and wa have a similar
behavior independently of the dimension of lattice. It is important to mention that
the curves plotted for d = 7 in Figs. 4 and 5 are the only ones in which the total
number of workers N is diﬀerent from the values used in lower dimension lattices
due to numerical limitations. Our sizes are considerably smaller than the world
record simulated in Ref. 11, because we do not use multi-spin coding and wa and
wm must be reevaluated after each step. Therefore, in Fig. 6 we plotted the rural
wage as function of time for lattice of d = 7, varying N in order to check its inﬂuence
in the results.

The variable re ≡ (1 − u)wm/wa measures the expected wages ratio. Observ-
ing Figures 4 and 5 one can see that re ≈ 1.0, what indicates that the expected
urban wage and the rural wage converge to same value. This is the Harris-Todaro
equilibrium condition.6

The deterministic total utility of each worker is calculated by using Eq. (6),
where can see two diﬀerrent interactions acting in the worker’s decision. The ﬁrst
part of right side of Eq. (6) acts like an external time dependent ﬁeld and in this case
is related to the diﬀerence of wages between rural and urban sector. The intensity of
this ﬁeld is calibrated by the constant K. The second part of right of Eq. (6) is the

interaction of a worker among his/her neighborhood and it is related to the inﬂuence
caused by the neighbors which intensity depends on the value of the constant J.

Therefore, in Ref. 1, to study the inﬂuence of the variation of these parameters
we ran several simulations where the ratio J/K and the size of the L so that we
could check their eﬀects in the values of the urban share. Now, we apply the same
procedure to lattices with dimensions d > 2.

lattice size L. Each ﬁgure of this set is done for diﬀerent dimension from d = 2,

N = Ld.

All sets of Fig. 7 reveal a similar distribution of the equilibrium values of the
urban share, nu, for the six diﬀerent dimensions simulated. The equilibrium urban
share is slightly diﬀerent when the spatial dimension d is changed. This result is in
agreement with Fig. 2 where one can see that d modiﬁes the speed of the migratory
process but it has little inﬂuence in the value of equilibrium of urban share of the
system, what explains the similar structures seen in all sets of Fig. 7.

4. Conclusion

In this paper we analyzed the rural-urban migration process by means of an agent-
based computational model. We extend the analysis carried out in our previous
work to lattices with dimensions up to seven.

The variation of the dimension of the lattices slightly modify some of the results
found in the study of a two-dimensional lattice. To explain this, it is important to
remember that the distribution of workers in the lattice does not mean a spatial
distribution but the deﬁnition of the neighborhood of each individual. Therefore,
the bigger the lattice dimension the bigger the neighborhood that each worker will
have which is the cause of the small diﬀerence in the results.

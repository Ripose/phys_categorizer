Abstract

We present an algorithm for rigid body diﬀusion Monte Carlo with importance sam-
pling, which is based on a rigorous short-time expansion of the Green’s function for
rotational motion in three dimensions. We show that this short-time approximation
provides correct sampling of the angular degrees of freedom, and provides a general
way to incorporate importance sampling for all degrees of freedom. The full impor-
tance sampling algorithm signiﬁcantly improves both calculational eﬃciency and
accuracy of ground state properties, and allows rotational and bending excitations
in molecular van der Waals clusters to be studied directly.

1 Introduction

Diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods provide a powerful theoretical ap-
proach to the study of weakly bound clusters of atoms and molecules. The
favorable polynomial scaling of DMC enables clusters with large numbers of
degrees of freedom to be studied, provided that suitable schemes for sampling
the multi-dimensional wavefunctions exist. In the case of van der Waals clus-
ters containing one or more molecules, there often exist several diﬀerent time
scales, deriving on the one hand from the monomer internal degrees of freedom,
and on the other hand from the ‘external’ monomer translations and rotations

which are associated with the van der Waals modes between monomers. Typi-
cally, there is a large time scale separation between the high frequency internal
vibrations of the monomer constituents, and lower frequency intermonomer
van der Waals modes. This time scale separation is often invoked to motivate
approximations in which one eﬀectively freezes the high frequency degrees of
freedom when studying the role of the low frequency modes. When applied to
intramolecular degrees of freedom using Diﬀusion Monte Carlo, this approxi-
mation leads to an algorithm ﬁrst proposed by Buch [1], commonly referred to
as ‘Rigid Body Diﬀusion Monte Carlo’ (RBDMC), in which all monomers are
treated as non-vibrating, rigid molecules which are free to rotate and translate
in the presence of intermolecular interactions.

The ﬁrst implementation of RBDMC for molecular clusters by Buch employed
a short-time Green’s function for the free rotation of each molecular monomer
in its instantaneous principal axis frame[1]. A convenient Gaussian short-time
approximation for such monomer rotational motion was assumed in that work.
A number of applications of RBDMC have since been carried out, all of which
use a combination of this angular sampling for monomer rotation in local
monomer principal axis frames, together with the conventional sampling of
translational motions of monomers in the laboratory frame[1–16]. The rigid
body rotations are carried out using either Euler angles, or quaternion alge-
bra [16]. Considerable use has been made of this algorithm for water clusters,
where the ﬂoppy intermolecular degrees of freedom are diﬃcult to study with
other methods for clusters larger than the water dimer [1,2,4,6,7,10,11,14–16].

Nearly all of the RBDMC applications to date employ DMC in its simplest
form, namely unbiased Monte Carlo sampling in which the ground state wave-
function is sampled directly without using any trial function. Exceptions to
this include a calculation for HF-Arn for which importance sampling of transla-
tional degrees of freedom was implemented[3], and a calculation for rotational
excitations in clusters of SF6Hen[17]. The latter calculation represents the ﬁrst
application of the complete importance sampling algorithm for rotations and
translations which is described in detail in this work. Such biased sampling
proves useful since unbiased sampling, while adequate for ground states of
relatively strongly bound or fairly rigid clusters, rapidly becomes less eﬃcient
for weakly bound systems. Importance sampling also allows for easier com-
putation of quantities other than the energy (e.g. structural quantities) that
would require descendant weighting[18,19] in unbiased DMC. Furthermore, it
is also more amenable to study of excited states than are unbiased sampling
techniques.

Biased sampling in DMC is generally achieved with the importance sampling
approach ﬁrst proposed by Kalos and co-workers for translational motions [20].
The improved eﬃciency is dramatic for very weakly bound systems such as
the clusters of helium and hydrogen, which are dominated by quantum eﬀects.

2

Both pure helium clusters[21] and doped helium clusters[22] have been studied
with this approach. Excited states can be obtained from ﬁxed node calcula-
tions in which there is no explicit trial function but where nodal constraints
are nevertheless imposed directly in an otherwise unbiased sampling proce-
dure[23]. More eﬃcient sampling of excited states within ﬁxed node is often
possible by using explicit trial functional forms. Exploration of nodal release,
nodal optimization, spectral evolution and other approaches to go beyond the
ﬁxed node approximation is an active area of research[10,24–34].

In this paper we ﬁrst outline the standard rigid body diﬀusion Monte Carlo
algorithm with unbiased sampling (Section 2). Our treatment includes a quan-
tum mechanical derivation of the short-time Green’s function for free rotation
of a general asymmetric top (Section 2.1). For spherical tops, formal solutions
for both the imaginary time, diﬀusive Green’s function[35] and the real time
Green’s function[36] were established a long time ago. However for a general
rigid body, i.e., an asymmetric top, formal solutions have been restricted to
eigenfunction expansions [37,38], and no rigorous derivation of the expected
Gaussian form for small angle diﬀusion has been presented. A formal solution
for this is useful since it enables extension for rotation in the presence of exter-
nal force ﬁelds (to which the quantum forces in biased diﬀusion Monte Carlo
are formally equivalent) to be naturally and rigorously implemented. In Sec-
tion 2.2 we show how the use of a rigid body diﬀusion Monte Carlo algorithm
is motivated, with a detailed discussion of the factors inﬂuencing time step
choice in a weakly bound system composed of both atoms and molecules. In
Section 3 we then extend the rotational Green’s function formalism to enable
direct importance sampling of rotational degrees of freedom. Implementation
of the full importance sampled RBDMC algorithm is described in Section 4. In
Section 5 we provide some basic applications of this approach which illustrate
its use. First, we demonstrate explicitly with detailed tests that such short-
time sampling of the angular degrees of freedom will cover the entire angular
conﬁguration space of a rigid body (Section 5.1). Then we show with speciﬁc
examples taken from studies of two weakly bound molecule-helium systems,
4Hen and HCN 4Hen, that full importance sampled RBDMC consid-
i.e., SF6
erably improves the eﬃciency of calculations for ground states (Section 5.2),
as well as enabling calculation of Van der Waals excitations in such systems
(Section 5.3).

The diﬀusion Monte Carlo method provides a stochastic approach to solution
of the Schr¨odinger equation

This is accomplished by ﬁrst transforming the equation to imaginary time,
τ = i t

and then solving the resulting relaxation equation with the use of a short time
approximation to the Green’s function for ˆH. The formal solution to Eq. (2)
is

where Q refers to the set of coordinates specifying a single body, and ~Q to the
entire set for the N-body system. In an all-atom calculation, these coordinates
will consist of the 3N-dimensional cartesian coordinates of the N-body system,
~R. We shall use the notation R to refer to the three-dimensional
i.e., ~Q
(center of mass) cartesian coordinates of a single body, and ~R to the 3N-
dimensional cartesian coordinates of the N-body system. If m of these bodies

Eq. (8) can be propagated in imaginary time τ to ﬁnd the asymptotic solution,
Eq. (6), given an accurate short-time Green’s function. The propagation is
started from some initial guess for the wave function, Ψ( ~Q, τ = 0), which
is represented as an ensemble of multi-dimensional conﬁguration points or
“walkers”:

Ψ( ~Q, τ = 0) ∼=

Thus the algorithmical issue reduces to ﬁnding an accurate short time Green’s
function for a given Hamiltonian ˆH, together with an eﬃcient sampling pro-
cedure for the multi-dimensional integral in Eq. (8).

The simplest diﬀusion Monte Carlo procedure samples the wave function
Ψ( ~Q, τ ) directly. This unbiased, or non-importance sampled DMC has been
extensively used in the past for applications to both electronic and nuclear
structure and energetics[18,23,39]. We now summarize the conventional im-
plementation of RBDMC using unbiased DMC, for Hamiltonians describing
the nuclear motion of N-body atomic or molecular systems, with

Note that this corresponds formally to rigid bodies moving with ﬁxed relative
orientations speciﬁed by the set of Euler angles
. In general, this would
not be a physically useful representation. However for a single molecule moving
in an atomic cluster, e.g., in a rare gas cluster, this can sometimes provide a
good representation, when the molecule is suﬃciently heavy that the molecular
rotational kinetic energy is small compared to the rare gas kinetic energy
contributions[41]. The potential term in Eq. (12) is diagonal in the position

In the position representation, Eq. (12) then becomes a product of non-local
single particle diﬀusive terms from the kinetic energy, and a local term from
the potential energy. Depending on its sign, the latter can lead to exponential
growth or decay of the amplitude Ψ( ~Q) in Eq. (8).

For Hamiltonians involving only rotational kinetic energy, we have for a general
rigid body, i.e., an asymmetric top,

The constants dpα are now seen to act as one-dimensional diﬀusion constants

noted above.

We note that Eq. (32) is formally overcomplete in angle space, giving rise to
a total integrated angular volume of (8π)3 instead of the requisite 4π2. This
is a consequence of the short-time factorization into three one-dimensional
rotations, Eq. (19). For a spherical top this can be avoided when the Eulerian
short-time limit described below is employed. A comparison of the two short-
time propagators for a spherical top is provided in Section 5, where we show
that the formal violation of the angular conﬁguration volume deriving from
the product of one-dimensional rotations does not cause problems if the time
step ∆τ is suﬃciently small. The short-time factorization can be improved
upon if necessary by making use of the split operator decomposition[40], but
we have not found this necessary in any applications to date.

¯h2/2I). Eq. (33) cor-
Schulman (see Eq. (4.9) in Ref.[36], with Γ
responds to the Eulerian description of rotation of a rigid body as a rotation
through a single angle ζ about an arbitrary axis ˆnζ[42]. It can be implemented
in a Monte Carlo sampling procedure by ﬁrst choosing a randomly oriented
axis ˆnζ (uniform sampling of azimuthal angle φ on the interval [0, 2π) and of
1, 0]), and then sampling the angle of rotation ζ about
cos(θ) on the interval [

has been employed in classical Monte Carlo rigid body simulations, but with
the Gaussian sampling of the rotation angle ζ replaced by uniform sampling
∆ζ0/2, ∆ζ0/2][43]. This satisﬁes the conditions of re-
inside a ﬁxed interval [
versibility, detailed balance, and accessibility of all orientations, but does not
correspond to the true Green’s function, Eq. (33). It will therefore not neces-
sarily yield the correct energies and expectation values in a quantum Monte
Carlo calculation.

A multi-dimensional conﬁguration (commonly referred to as a ’walker’), now
carries both translational and angular coordinates. Sampling of the rotational
and translational degrees of freedom are carried out by independent diﬀusive
moves in these coordinates, as described by the factorization in Eq.(34). How-
ever, there will be coupling of the translations with rotations via the potential
energy term V ( ~R, ~Ω) in Eq. (12). Details of the stochastic evaluation of Eq.
(15) is described in Section 4. Use of Eq. (34) is usually referred to as ”rigid
body diﬀusion Monte Carlo” (often abbreviated by its acronym RBDMC),
because of the implicit representation of the full N-body kinetic energy by a
sum of rigid body rotational contributions together with the sum of the center
of mass translational terms.

2.2 Time step considerations

The time step parameter used during the Monte Carlo simulation is deter-
mined by two factors. First, as pointed out by Suhm and Watts [18], when all
other factors are equal, the time step is controlled by the smallest mass. In-
deed, for light particles, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is large and the time step has
to be small enough so that the particle does not move too far in a single step.
But this is not the only factor. The eﬀect of the potential can also be impor-
tant. For example, strongly bound particles must be sampled with a smaller
displacement, and hence with a smaller time step, to avoid the majority of
Monte Carlo conﬁgurational moves ending in destruction of the conﬁguration.
In the general case of a mixture of light and heavy particles, the time step has
therefore to be chosen not only according to the smallest mass value, but also
taking the eﬀect of the potential into account. The presence of heavy, strongly
bound particles may require the use of a shorter time step. For example, in
the case of the water dimer, Gregory and Clary [44] use time steps of 0.5 -
5.0 au for the all-atom calculations. Those small values are needed because of

10

the presence of high frequency internal modes of the monomers. When using
RBDMC, they were able to increase the time step up to 30 - 60 au, because the
introduction of the rigid body approximation eliminated these strongly con-
ﬁned degrees of freedom. This decrease in computational time step is generally
cited as the primary motivation for an RBDMC calculation.

The situation with regard to time steps is somewhat more complicated for
helium clusters, where a wide range of time scales is operative. For pure he-
lium clusters, the time steps used vary typically from 1000 to 10000 au [41,45].
Introduction of a non-rotating, rigid SF6 impurity requires a time step reduc-
tion to 250 - 500 au [41,46] even though the mass of SF6 is much bigger than
that of He. This reduction of time step is due to the fact that the helium-
SF6 interaction potential is considerably stronger than the He-He potential:
the larger time step will lead to ineﬃcient sampling of the He-SF6 relative
motion. When the molecular rotation is included, the situation becomes quite
complicated as one now has the additional intrinsic time scale of the molecular
rotation. Thus one needs to compare the corresponding diﬀusion coeﬃcients
dp and Dp for each species p included in the simulation, and to assess both the
relative roles of the masses/moments of inertia (measured via d and D), and
the conﬁning role of the interactions in all degrees of freedom. For the systems
studied in this paper, namely SF6 and HCN in clusters of 4He, the deﬁning
parameters are given in Table 1. The time steps required to eliminate any
time step bias for these two systems are of order 20 - 40 au for SF6, 10 - 30 au
for HCN) in implementations where attempted moves involve all particles be-
ing moved together. Somewhat larger time steps can be used when attempted
50 au for SF6 in 4Hen). The latter
moves involve only single particles (e.g.,
is preferred for all except very diﬀuse systems. For molecules interacting with
helium, in general all-atom potentials are not available, and this is a second
reason why RBDMC is essential here.

3 Rigid Body Diﬀusion Monte Carlo with Importance sampling

a Fokker-Planck formulation[47]. We derive here an alternative solution using
operators which provides a introduction to the subsequent new derivation of
the full translational and rotational importance sampled Green’s function, ˜G.

Details of the implementation of Eq. (58) are presented in the next Section.

We note that, for the speciﬁc case of diatomic molecules, Lewerenz has pro-
posed another method to implement rigid rotor motion, namely the method

15

of adiabatic constraints [48]. This method is attractively simple and easy to
implement for ground state studies of linear molecules [48–50], although it
becomes considerably more involved when applied to more general rigid bod-
ies [18]. Importance sampling of rotational degrees of freedom would be prob-
lematic within such an approach however, since it is not clear how to combine
this with the adiabatic constraints. In particular, it is not obvious at what
stage the quantum forces should be introduced, i.e., before or after imposition
of the adiabatic constraint. Recently, Sarsa et al have shown that classical
constraint dynamics can be used to generally impose bond length and bond
angle constraints, in both biased and unbiased DMC[34].

4 Mixed frame and ﬁxed frame implementations

In order to demonstrate Monte Carlo solution of Eq. (8) with Eqs. (34)
and (58), we consider a system composed of m rigid rotors and n atoms
(n + m = N). The Monte Carlo propagation over a step ∆τ requires then
3(m + n) translational diﬀusion moves, 3m rotational diﬀusion moves, and the
local exponential growth/decay operations. The translational Green’s func-
tion, Eq. (15), consists of a product of a diﬀusive term deriving from ˆT t, the
translational kinetic energy, and a branching term deriving from the potential
energy, V . Two kinds of moves are thereby made on an initially established
ensemble of multi-dimensional conﬁguration points or “walkers”, Eq. (9). The
ﬁrst kind of move is a diﬀusion from ~Rj to new positions ~R′
j, implemented by
sampling the vector ~Rj −
j from a 3N-dimensional Gaussian distribution,
2Dp∆τ in each of the 3N cartesian coordinates. The second move
of width
is a “branching” which modiﬁes the weight of each walker in the ensemble
by the exponential factor e−∆τ [(V ( ~R′)+V ( ~R))/2−ER]. This can be implemented by
i) replicating/destroying conﬁgurations, or by ii) maintaining and updating
a continuous weighting factor associated with each conﬁguration, or by iii)
a combination of weights and replication[47,49]. The role of the reference en-
ergy ER now becomes clear, i.e., it provides a means to reduce the ﬂuctuations
deriving from the branching term.

~R′

q

Propagation with ˜Gt, Eq.(48), is performed by a simple modiﬁcation of the
unbiased propagation described above, namely that the diﬀusive moves are
modiﬁed to include the contribution from the quantum force ~F ( ~R). The co-
ordinates of each particle are therefore updated according to, e.g., for Rpx,

energy instead of

of walkers.

The implementation for the rotational Green’s function, unbiased Gr and bi-
ased ˜Gr, is similar. In the unbiased formalism, diﬀusive rotational moves con-

For the full Green’s function, both translational and rotational diﬀusion moves
are made. We now give a more detailed explanation of the various possible
implementations of this in diﬀerent frames of reference.

4.1 Mixed Frame

In the general case, i.e. for more than one rotor, it is necessary to use diﬀer-
ent frames for the rotation and the translation moves. The rotation must be
performed in the principal axes frame, PAF of each rotor, the translations are
done in the laboratory frame, SF. The evaluation of the potential and of the
trial function have to be done in consistent frames. At each time step in the
random walk, three rotations around the principal axes of the molecule are
made. During the time step τ
τ , the PAF (PAFτ −∆τ ) is thus rotated
into a new PAF: (PAFτ ). The rotation matrix describing the attempted move
is :

ˆR(τ ) = ˆRx(φτ

(62)

where ˆRα(φ) represents a rotation of φ around the α-axis, and φτ
α denotes the
angle moved around this axis in time τ . The corresponding relation between
the coordinates in the new PAF and in the old can be derived using the
following identity:

In an unbiased “pure” DMC calculation, φx, φy and φz are sampled from a
Gaussian distribution which is centered at zero and has width √2dα∆τ . In an
importance sampled calculation, we have to add the quantum force, according
to Eq. (61). Rotation around x modiﬁes the orientation of the y principal axis
of the rotor. The second rotation is thus made around the new orientation of
this axis, followed by the third rotation around the subsequent new orientation
of the z principal axis. Due to the small values of these angles, we neglect the
non-commutation of these 3 rotations.

In the Mixed Frame formulation, the SF cartesian coordinates for the centers
of mass of all particles are used at every time step in the scheme. The use
of the
matrix allows us to compute the coordinates of the relative vectors
between the atoms and the rotors, in the PAF of each rotor. These relative
vectors are needed for evaluation of the potential term and of the trial wave
function.

As noted above, the Mixed Frame formulation is needed whenever the system
contains more than one rotor. It is also required whenever the Euler angles
deﬁning the orientation of the PAF in the SF are needed. These angles are
deﬁned by the
matrix. Knowledge of these angles is necessary for calculation
of excited states within a ﬁxed node approximation whenever the nodes are
imposed in a SF frame, because the trial function is then an explicit function
of these angles. In the particular case of a trial function that depends only
1, 0, 0
on the second Euler angle , e.g. ΨT =
P33, computation

is suﬃcient. Section 5.3 provides an
and storage of only the last column of

illustrative example of calculation of internal bending excitations for He-HCN
using this Mixed Frame formulation.

4.2 Fixed Molecular Frame

When the system under consideration contains only one rotor, the Monte Carlo
propagation can be performed in the PAF of this rotor. Like in the previous
section, at each time step in the random walk, three rotations around the
principal axes of the molecule are made. The corresponding relations between
the coordinates are given by equation (66).

In order to perform the translational moves, one continuously follows the
molecular orientation. Then at each time step (τ ), the atoms and the center of
mass of the rotor are deﬁned by their coordinates in the molecular PAFτ . The
(τ ) is used to compute the coordinates in the new PAF using their
matrix
coordinates in the former one (PAFτ −∆τ ). The translational moves are then
made according to Eq. (60), using the coordinates in the old PAF. Vectors
describing the position of the atoms in the two PAF’s are used to compute

R

19

the atom-rotor interaction potential and the trial wave function, before and
after the step.

Calculations for SF6-He system using the implementation described in this
section leads to the same results as those obtained with the Fixed Laboratory
Frame. One disadvantage of this Fixed Molecular Frame scheme is that it does
not allow for easy computation of the Euler angles deﬁning the orientation of
the PAF with respect to the SF frame.

4.3 Fixed Laboratory Frame

In the case of a spherical top molecule, Eq. (17) is applicable in the space-ﬁxed
laboratory reference frame (SF) as well as in the PAF, because any choice of
orthogonal frame diagonalizes the inertia tensor. The rotational moves can
therefore be made around the axes of the SF frame (X, Y, Z). Although the
rotation moves can be made without knowing the orientation of the rotor at a
given time, it is necessary to keep track of the molecular orientation in the SF
frame because computation of the interaction with the other rotors and atoms
(Eq. (11)) requires knowledge of the orientation of the preassigned reference
directions of the spherical top (e.g. the S—F bonds in the case of SF6 Hen
clusters).

Rotational moves, performed according to Eq. (63), are combined with trans-
lational moves of the n atoms and of the m center of masses of the rotors,
made in the cartesian coordinates of this Laboratory Frame (SF), within the
conventional approach (Section 4 above). This ﬁxed Laboratory Frame scheme
has recently been implemented in a study of rotational excitations of SF6 in
helium clusters [17], and is also used in the SF6 applications presented here.

5 Applications

5.1 Angular Sampling in Three Dimensions: SF6-He

The SF6 Hen system with n = 1 was used to test the rotational sampling
algorithm. In particular, since for a spherical top we know the exact three-
dimensional rotational Green’s function (Eq. (33) and Appendix A), we can
check the accuracy of the short-time decomposition of this into three one-
dimensional rotational factors, Eq. (32). The calculations are carried out in
the Fixed Laboratory Frame as described in section 4.3, and the SF6-He in-
teraction is modeled using the anisotropic potential of Pack et al[52]. We

implemented both sampling schemes for this system, i.e., one rotation about
a randomly chosen axis, corresponding to Eq. (33), and three rotations about
the space ﬁxed X, Y , and Z axes, corresponding to Eq. (32). Figure 1 (dot-
ted lines) shows the evolution of the distribution of Euler angles (orientation)
obtained from the direct sampling of the three-dimensional rotational Green’s
function. It also shows (solid lines) the evolution of the Euler angle distribu-
tions obtained with the factorization into three independent rotations. Both of
these methods yield similar distributions that exhibit the expected Gaussian
form (see Appendix A). The computed ground state energies are summarized
in Table 2. The value obtained with rotation incorporated is in good agree-
ment with result obtained using basis set expansion methods. These reference
calculations employed the Finite Basis Representation - Discrete Variable Rep-
resentation (FBR-DVR) collocation scheme of Leforestier using a Wigner ba-
sis set [53]. We also show the energy obtained when the molecular rotation
is omitted. This is
1 K lower, and is in good agreement with previous
DMC studies made without rotation [41]. Since the energetic eﬀect of rotation
is very small for n = 1, i.e., the rotational energy increment in the SF6-He
ground state is only
1 K, we prefer to investigate the accuracy of the two
diﬀerent short time Green’s function approximations using an artiﬁcial SF6
having rotational constant B0 = 0.91 cm−1, i.e., 10 times the true gas phase
value. This increases the variation of the energy due to rotation and ampliﬁes
the eﬀect of any approximations. Rotating by performing a single rotation
about a randomly chosen axis yields a ground state energy (E1rot = -33.9(6)
K) that is consistent with both the value obtained by implementing the three
rotations about ﬁxed axes scheme (E3rot = -33.8(2) K) and a FBR-DVR refer-
ence calculation (EF BR = -33.6 K). In contrast, incorrect sampling (omitting
the a = 3 factor discussed in Appendix A) yields erroneous energies which are
too low (E = -35.8(7)). This omission is operationally equivalent to reducing
the rotational constant by a factor of 3.

5.2 Importance sampling to overcome artiﬁcial dissociation in medium-sized

weakly bound clusters

The necessity of importance sampling appears already in ground state studies
of moderately sized, weakly bound clusters, e.g., SF6 Hen and HCN Hen with

21

n > 12. Both of these systems require importance sampling to avoid the
unphysical dissociation of helium atoms which can result from the occasional
diﬀusion of He out to large distances from the cluster. In unbiased DMC, once

Fig. 1. Euler angle distributions for SF6 calculated using the three rotations about
ﬁxed cartesian axes scheme (solid lines), and using the single rotation about a
randomly chosen axis scheme (dotted lines). The initial conﬁgurations all started
with the same arbitrary initial molecular orientation. The distributions shown here
are plotted at three increasing time slices to demonstrate the gaussian spreading.

22

an atom diﬀuses very far from the weakly bound cluster it has only a very
small probability to return diﬀusively to the region of stronger binding, while
the energetic penalty for motion further away from the molecule becomes
negligible. Moreover the conﬁguration space for a motion toward the molecule
is much smaller than the one for a motion away. This is therefore a metastable
situation from which it is very diﬃcult to return to conﬁgurations of strong
binding. The result is that helium atoms become ”lost” outside the boundaries
of the simulation box, leading to false dissociation as well as to artiﬁcially high
energies.

One of the attractive features of unbiased DMC is that it provides the full-
dimensional wave function. This may be ﬁt to obtain trial functions for im-
portance sampling, as has been done by a number of authors [32,54,55]. For
the molecule-helium clusters with n = 1, the helium wave function may be
squared to obtain the density. However, for n > 1, three-dimensional represen-
tation of the n-helium wave function is not possible. In order to nevertheless
provide a visual representation of the wave function, we shall extract an ef-
fective one-particle wave function by projection, binning independently the
position of the n heliums in the molecular frame.

For the spherical top SF6 molecule, these calculations are performed in the
space-ﬁxed, laboratory frame (SF), described in the previous section. For the
linear HCN molecule, calculations are performed in the Mixed Frame scheme
of Section 4.1. Rotation around the z-axis of the PAF is not allowed (Bz = 0),
and consequently, the rotation formalism presented there is reduced to two
angles.

Simple trial wave functions can be used to avoid artiﬁcial dissociation. For one
rigid molecule, a form of trial wave function possessing the correct permutation
symmetry is given by the product of pair correlation terms[22]:

ΨT ( ~R, ~Ω) =

ΨHe−X(Rp, RX, ΩX)

ΨHe−He(Rp, Rq).

ity we have used ΨHe−He(Rp, Rq) = 1. For SF6He1 and SF6He20, the helium
atoms lie within the ﬁrst solvation shell. As long as we are interested primar-
ily in the binding energies here, and not concerned with detailed structural
information in the angular degrees of freedom, we can adequately describe the
He-SF6 correlations using simple radial wavefunctions, of the form

, and X=SF6. For this demonstration with n = 20,
where rpX =
we used a = 0.80 and c = 42000 in atomic units. These parameters were
obtained from ﬁtting results of unbiased simulations for similar n values. Care
should be taken not to choose a trial wavefunction that is too restrictive (i.e.
negligible amplitude in regions that may actually be important). Such choices
of wavefunction can give rise to instabilities and to erroneous energies. If the
radial trial function is too narrow, falling oﬀ too sharply in the repulsive
regime close to the impurity, the convergence of the DMC scheme becomes
more diﬃcult and the energy can become stuck below the true value. We
found this to be the case when a trial function ﬁt to unbiased wave functions
obtained for small n (n = 1 with a = 1.5, c = 6000 a.u.) was employed for
importance sampling of a cluster with signiﬁcantly larger n (n = 20). This
emphasizes the importance of choosing a trial function which does not impose
excessive restrictions on the sampling.

For HCN, we used the radial part obtained from the high quality anisotropic
He-HCN trial function derived for use in the ﬁxed node calculations of Section

The eﬀective one-particle helium wave functions obtained by unbiased RB-
DMC are shown in Figure 2a for SF6He20, and in Figure 3a for HCN He20.
The ”wings” at the outer edge of the binning domains are the signature of
dissociating helium atoms. They appear here because we put all walkers hav-
ing a position larger than the domain deﬁnition into the last bin at the edge
of the domain. The average number of artiﬁcially dissociated atoms deﬁned
as those lying at a distance greater than 20 a.u. for both systems, is ndiss ∼

for HCN, and ndiss ∼

1 for SF6.

This dissociation phenomenon also has a pronounced eﬀect on the energy.
For clusters containing smaller numbers of helium atoms, unbiased RBDMC
and importance sampled DMC lead to the same energies, as they should if
both calculations are converged. For n = 20, convergence of the importance
sampled DMC is straightforward, yielding a ground state energy of -237(4)
K for HCN and -607 (11) K for SF6. However with unbiased DMC, in sharp
contrast to this situation, full convergence of the energy is much more diﬃcult
- even impossible - for this number of helium atoms, because of the artiﬁcial
dissociation of helium walkers, for both HCN and SF6. We can only obtain
an upper estimate of the ground state energy as a result. For SF6 this esti-

unbiased calculations. It is signiﬁcant that this phenomenon is seen not only

26

for the relatively weakly bound HCN molecule in 4Hen, but also for the much
more strongly bound SF6 molecule. Our analysis implies that this is a general
phenomenon which will occur for any species beyond a minimum size which
appears to be somewhat less than one solvation shell.

the use of a simple radial function which provides binding of the helium atoms
to the embedded molecule very eﬀectively removes the artiﬁcial dissociation
problem, and allows us to fully converge a ground state energy calculation.
Although we do not evaluate structural quantities here other than this mixed
density, we note that the use of importance sampling does allow a relatively
straightforward access to computation of structural quantities using second-
order estimators [22].

5.3 Excited States

Our third application addresses the computation of excited states for the He-
HCN complex. Experiments in doped helium clusters show that the rotational
spectrum of small molecules inside clusters of 4He possesses the same sym-
metry as the corresponding spectra in the gas phase, but that the eﬀective
rotational constants are reduced [56,57]. For HCN this reduction is about
20%,[58,59] considerably less than the
80% reduction seen for the more
strongly bound species such as SF6 [60]. Table 1 shows that HCN is much
more weakly bound to helium than SF6, but that in both cases the ground
state energy of the n = 1 complex lies above the saddle point of the interac-
tion potential. Analysis of such rotationally excited states within a ﬁxed node
approximation requires some estimate of the relevant nodal structure. Insight
into this can be obtained from level assignments made according to simple
models. The earlier study of SF6 in 4HeN from our group calculated rotational

j, where J is the total angular momentum, and j
levels corresponding to J
the molecular angular momentum [17]. For He-HCN, we evaluate here instead
the excited state which has been assigned by Atkins and Hutson [61], and
j = 1, ℓ = 1, J = 0 >. In this assignment
by Drucker et al [62], to the level
scheme, J is the total rotational quantum number, j the quantum number of
HCN, which is to a good approximation conserved in the weakly bound com-
plex, and ℓ an “orbital” quantum number associated with the rotation of the
helium around the HCN. For this excited state the ﬁxed nodal approximation
can be imposed in the molecular frame, as we describe below. Nevertheless, we
employ here the Mixed Frame implementation of the rotational importance
sampling algorithm, rather than the Fixed Molecular Frame version. For a
linear molecule, while we must always perform the rotations in the molecular
frame, nodal structures may be imposed in either the MF or the SF frame,
leading to the natural choice of the Mixed Frame implementation as the most
general in this case.

In order to obtain a trial wave function for the ﬁxed node calculations, we
ﬁrst performed pure DMC runs which allow us to compute the ground state
eigenfunction (see Figure 4). This was ﬁt to an analytic form ΨT (r, θ), where

jected into the molecular frame for He-HCN. The orientation of the HCN molecule
is the same as in ﬁgure 3.

r and θ are the usual Jacobi coordinates of the He with respect to the center
of mass and orientation of HCN, to obtain a high quality trial function. We
use the following Legendre polynomial expansion:

Such a high quality trial function is necessary for the ﬁxed node calculations of
the He-HCN complex described here. In order to construct a trial excited state
function for a ﬁxed node calculation, we combined this high quality ground
state trial function with a simple function that imposes the nodal constraint.
This is chosen here by comparison with the exact excited state function, which
was obtained by repeating the collocation calculations of Aktins and Hut-
son[61] to compute and analyze the wavefunction for this level. The energy of
8.5 K, and a contour plot of the corresponding wave function
this level is
is shown on ﬁgure 5. The structure of this function implies a strong internal

bending character to this excitation. The excited state function possesses a
single nodal surface, which is seen to be approximately r-independent. This
motivated us to employ a ﬁxed nodal surface deﬁned by cos(θ + χ), where χ is
a parameter and θ is the internal Jacobi angle of the cluster i.e. the trial func-
tion used is thus ˜ΨT (r, θ) = ΨT (r, θ) cos(θ + χ). Since the calculation is carried
out in the mixed frame formulation, this trial function is implicitly dependent
upon the orientation of the rigid body in the space ﬁxed frame, even though

29

the nodal structure is imposed in the molecular frame. Comparison of the en-
ergy obtained for calculations restricted to each of the two sides of the nodal
surface allows us to then obtain the optimal value of the parameter χ. This is
arrived at when these two energies are equal. A similar procedure was used by
McCoy and co-workers in an interactive sense to optimize nodal surfaces[32].
For both the ground state and excited state computation, we use an ensemble
of approximately 5000-6000 walkers. We perform a block averaging in order
to reduce the correlation between successive steps. After equilibration of the
ensemble, we perform 1 run of 800 blocks, each of which consists of 150 time
steps with ∆τ = 10 au. We reject all moves corresponding to a crossing of the
nodal surface, keeping the corresponding walker at its former position[39].

The optimal value of χ was found to be χ = 15.65 degrees, which yielded a
common energy of -8.4(2) K on both sides of the resulting nodal surface. This
ﬁxed node value is in excellent agreement with the value -8.48797 K (-5.89897
cm−1) obtained from the collocation method in Ref. [61], especially when the
approximate nature of the nodal constraint is taken into account.

When studying clusters with larger numbers of helium atoms using unbiased
RBDMC, we noticed that the θ dependence apparent in Figure 4 tends to
smooth out [63]. This suggests that for larger clusters, it might be adequate
for some purposes to reduce the trial function to the radial term only, e.g., for
studying ground state energies (Section V.B).

6 Conclusions

We have derived an algorithm for Rigid Body Monte Carlo with importance
sampling for all degrees of freedom, including both translation and rotation,
and provided a rigorous derivation of the short time rotational Green’s func-
tion and its associated quantum forces. Three possible implementations of the
algorithm were presented, which diﬀer according to the combination of frames
used for rotational and translational moves during the propagation. The most
general implementation scheme is the mixed frame implementation in which
translational moves are made in the laboratory reference frame, while rota-
tional moves of all rigid bodies are made in the principal axis frame of each
monomer. This allows full importance sampling calculations of molecular clus-
ters to be performed.

We have presented several applications of this importance sampled Rigid Body
Diﬀusion Monte Carlo. First, we demonstrated the correctness of the short-
time factorization of the rotational Green’s function by comparison of the
resulting product of one-dimensional rotations with the well known three-
dimensional formulation for a spherical top. Second, we showed that impor-

30

tance sampling of translational degrees of freedom is essential to avoid non-
physical dissociation of weakly bound helium atoms in doped quantum clusters
of helium when more than a few helium atoms are present. Third, we showed
how excited states can be easily accessed with this algorithm using the ﬁxed
node approximation and a trial wavefunction with an implicit dependence
on the orientation of the rigid body. The same algorithm may now be ap-
plied to study excitations beyond the ﬁxed node approximation, e.g., using
the POITSE approach[31].

In order to provide a sampling of the operator

1/2I, according to the conﬁguration representation of Eq. (33), one
where d
must choose both an arbitrary axis of rotation, and an angle of rotation. In
order to implement this, it is necessary to ﬁrst specify the frame of reference of
the operator ˆL, i.e., its axis of quantization for Lz. This is evident on expansion
of the operator in the angle space,

where ˆΩ is a unit vector in an arbitrary direction, and a is a constant to be
determined. Expanding both sides of Eq. (73) to order (∆τ )2, we ﬁnd

e−d ˆL2∆τ =

the integral over the spherical angular coordinates dΩ

from which we conclude that a = 3. Sampling of Eq. (73) can then proceed
by a) choosing a random vector ˆΩ, and then b) sampling the angle of rotation
(2d∆τ ). This procedure
by choosing a value from a gaussian of width
provides access to the full angular space in Eq. (73). When we are dealing with
small rotations, this approach gives rise to similar orientational distributions
to the scheme in which 3 small rotations are performed about the 3 cartesian
axes (see Figures 1). This similarity will continue to hold as long as the rotation
ζ is small enough such that the single rotation about the arbitrary axis ˆnζ can
be approximately factored into a product of three cartesian rotations, i.e.,

made with the small angle ζ sin θ cos φ.

8.3 Computational Scheme

Start with an initial ensemble of walkers (e.g. distributed according to the trial
wavefunction). Compute the local energy (also used as the starting reference
energy) for the initial ensemble and then propagate the ensemble in imaginary
time by repeating the following steps for each walker (conﬁguration).

(1) Move each host and impurity atom according to equation (60). This move

involves a Gaussian random number and a quantum force.

(2) Each move is then accepted or rejected with acceptance probability given

by min(1, W ( ~Q′, ~Q)) where

This involves having to recompute the quantum force after the particle

has been moved.

(3) Rotate the impurity atom according to equation (61)
(4) Again, this move is accepted or rejected using the above criterion.
(5) Determine eﬀective time step, ∆τef f . See Ref. [39]. One has to average
the eﬀective time step over the various kinds of moves since in general,
each kind of move has a diﬀerent diﬀusion constant.
(6) Compute the new local energy, EL( ~Q′) (equation (37))
(7) Compute branching factor, M:

where ∆ is a random number that is uniformly distributed over (0,1).
If M = 0, this walker is destroyed, otherwise M

conﬁguration are added to the ensemble.

(8) To maintain a stable population size (N(τ )), update the reference energy

according to

ER(τ + ∆τ ) = ER(τ ) +

log

α
∆τ

N ∗
N(τ + ∆τ )

where the population control parameter, α is chosen to be as small as
possible (to avoid biasing the results) but large enough that the popula-
tion size stays within acceptable limits. N ∗ is the desired population size
and is often chosen to be the starting population N(0) or N(τ ).

Of course, many variants of the above procedure will also work. In the HCN
studies, for example, all of the translation moves and rotations are performed
simultaneously and then accepted or rejected as a single move. When studying

33

excited states using the ﬁxed-node approximation, one also adds the additional
constraint that moves crossing the nodal surface are automatically rejected.

The statistical error is estimated using block averaging, where the propagation
is split into Nb blocks of Ns steps where Ns is longer than the correlation
length[47]. In the literature, various methods are used to compute averages
and errors from this blocked data:

(1) Take 1 data point per block, and compute the average and standard error

from these Nb data points

(2) Same as above but use the block average values for the Nb data points
(3) Use all the data points in computing the mean. The standard error for
each block, σb, is computed from the Ns values within each block. These
are averaged to determine the reported error:

σ =

σb
√Nb −

In our examples, we report the largest of the above estimates (usually close in
value).

Abstract

We have studied the driving forces governing reconstructions on polar GaN surfaces em-
ploying ﬁrst-principles total-energy calculations. Our results reveal properties not observed
for other semiconductors, as for example a strong tendency to stabilize Ga-rich surfaces.
This mechanism is shown to have important consequences on various surface properties:
Novel and hitherto unexpected structures are stable, surfaces may become metallic although
GaN is a wide-bandgap semiconductor, and the surface energy is signiﬁcantly higher than
for other semiconductors. We explain these features in terms of the small lattice constant of
GaN and the unique bond strength of N2 molecules.

Introduction

Progress in the materials quality of GaN has led recently to the ﬁrst commercially available,
highly eﬃcient optoelectronic devices emitting in the green and blue/UV region [1, 2]. A sub-
stantial problem in growing GaN and its alloys is the lack of a lattice-matched substrate. Bulk
GaN can be grown only in small crystallites and sapphire, the most commonly used substrate,
has an extremely large lattice mismatch (14%). Another problem is the high nitrogen vapor
pressure of bulk GaN requiring highly activated nitrogen precursors for the growth. Both is-
sues make it diﬃcult to grow routinely and in a controlled fashion high quality GaN. In order
to overcome these problems it is critical to understand the fundamental growth aspects on an
atomic level.

Initially, it has been believed that the driving forces behind surface reconstructions and growth
are essentially the same as for conventional semiconductors such as e.g. GaAs. However, it
soon became obvious that GaN behaves in many aspects very diﬀerently. For example, impurity
concentrations are signiﬁcantly higher than in conventional semiconductors and p-type doping is
rather diﬃcult [3]. Also, growth is much more aﬀected by even small changes in the growth envi-
ronment and the structure of the initial nucleation layer at the substrate controls the properties
and quality of the entire epitaxial layer.

1

Recent investigations also revealed surface structures for the technologically relevant polar GaN
surfaces which are very diﬀerent from the well-established structures of III-V semiconductor sur-
faces. Furthermore, some of these structures disobey well-accepted empirical rules and models,
which have been found useful for understanding why and how semiconductor surfaces recon-
struct. For example, on cubic GaN (001) (which is commonly used to grow the cubic phase of
GaN) ﬁrst-principles calculations identiﬁed a Ga-terminated surface as the energetically most
stable structure. On this surface four Ga atoms form linear tetramers [4]. This is in contrast to
conventional semiconductors where dimers are the preferred building blocks on (001) surfaces.
Another example is the Ga adlayer structure which has been found combining detailed STM
and LEED measurements with ﬁrst-principles calculations at the wurtzite GaN (000¯1) surface
[5]. This surface violates several rules: It disobeys electron counting, atoms in the top surface
layer sit on singly coordinated sites, and each surface atom has the highest possible number of
dangling-bond states.

The aim of the present paper is to identify the properties of GaN that give rise to these unusual
surface reconstructions, to understand why the empirical rules that have been well established
to describe conventional semiconductor surfaces fail for GaN, and to determine whether these
rules can be extended to GaN. We will focus here on the mechanisms and general principles
of the surface reconstructions. Detailed descriptions of the speciﬁc atomic structures and the
calculations for cubic and wurtzite GaN can be found in Refs. [4, 5]. After a brief description
of the computational details (Sec. II) we will analyze the surface energies of unreconstructed
GaN and GaAs surfaces. Based on these results we show that a characteristic feature of GaN
surfaces is the tendency to have Ga atoms in the surface layer. This feature, combined with
the small lattice constant, is shown to be responsible for the unusual surface reconstructions.
Finally, based on this analysis we derive conclusions concerning possible surface reconstructions.

2 Computational method

The energy necessary to create a surface is called the surface energy. This energy is not con-
stant but depends on the speciﬁc thermodynamic conditions. Speciﬁcally, in GaN the relative
concentration of Ga and N atoms at the surface determines the surface energy. The atomic
reservoirs with which Ga and N atoms are exchanged in order to modify the surface stoichiome-
try determines the chemical potentials (µGa, µN). The chemical potentials for Ga and N are not
independent variables, since for thermal equilibrium situations both species are in equilibrium
with the GaN bulk:

The surface energy at p = 0 and T = 0 is then given by:

µGaN = µGa + µN

γ = Etot − µGaNGa − µNNN

(1)

(2)

where NGa and NN are the number of Ga and N atoms and Etot is the total energy of the surface
obtained from density-functional theory.

The gallium chemical potential can be varied only between certain limits. A major criterion is
that the chemical potential for an element is less than the chemical potential of the corresponding

2

bulk material (or molecules) since otherwise this element would form the energetically more
stable bulk or molecular structure. For the gallium chemical potential an upper limit is therefore
given if GaN is in thermodynamic equilibrium with bulk Ga. This case is called the Ga-rich
limit. The lower limit is given for GaN in thermodynamic equilibrium with N2 molecules; it is
therefore called the N-rich limit. Using these relations and Eq. (1) we get:

µGa(bulk) + ∆HGaN ≤ µGa ≤ µGa(bulk)

.

Here, ∆HGaN is the heat of formation which is deﬁned as:

∆HGaN = µGaN(bulk) − µGa(bulk) − µN2(molecule)

.

(3)

(4)

A negative heat of formation means the reaction is exothermic. The corresponding bulk chemical
potentials are calculated from the bulk forms of Ga metal (orthorhombic), N (N2 molecule) and
GaN (wurtzite). The total energies have been calculated employing density-functional theory in
the local density approximation, in combination with a plane-wave basis set and ﬁrst-principles
pseudopotentials. The exchange and correlation energy functionals are those derived from the
homogeneous electron gas calculations of Ceperley and Alder [7]. We use soft Troullier-Martins
[8] pseudopotentials constructed with the fhi98PP package [9]. An explicit treatment of the Ga
3d electrons as valence electrons has been found crucial to calculate accurate surface energies.
This required a large plane wave energy cutoﬀ making our calculations computationally rather
challenging both with respect to CPU-time and memory demand. We therefore used a parallel
version of our plane wave code on a Cray T3E. This version had been speciﬁcally optimized
with respect to data and CPU partitioning. Details about the program can be obtained from
Ref. [10].

3 Analysis of the surface structures

As pointed out in Sec. 1, surface reconstructions of GaN exhibit features that have not been
observed on other III-V semiconductor surfaces. In order to identify the mechanisms causing the
unusual reconstruction we will analyze the diﬀerences between polar GaN and GaAs surfaces.
We will focus on polar surfaces since non-polar surfaces show essentially the same features as
found for conventional semiconductors [14]. Since we are here interested in the mechanisms
driving surface reconstructions on GaN surfaces let us ﬁrst brieﬂy recall the rules and models
that are typically applied in a discussion of conventional semiconductor surfaces. A commonly
used principle is called the electron counting rule (ECR). According to the ECR the equilibrium
surface is one in which the number of available electrons in the surface layer will exactly ﬁll all
dangling-bond states in or near the valence band and leave all states in or close to the conduction
band empty [11]. An important consequence of this rule is that a surface satisfying the ECR
will be semiconducting. Further, just by counting electrons and dangling-bonds a large number
of potential surface structures can be eliminated. While this rule is empirical, it has been found
to work well for almost all conventional semiconductor surfaces. Only a few exceptions have
been reported [16, 20].

The ECR is commonly justiﬁed in terms of Harrison’s bond-orbital model [12]. Atoms in con-
ventional semiconductors are sp3 hybridized. In the absence of reconstruction some of the hybrid

orbitals cannot form bonds, but instead give rise to partially occupied sp3 dangling-bond states.
According to Harrison the energy levels of the cation dangling-bond states are high in energy
(lying close to or within the conduction band) and should therefore be empty. Dangling bond
states localized on the more electronegative anions, however, are close to or within the valence
band and should be ﬁlled. Other mechanisms driving the reconstruction at semiconductor sur-
faces are: (i) the tendency to reduce the number of dangling bond states on the surface by
forming e.g. dimers, adatoms or trimers [20, 21] and (ii) minimizing the electrostatic energy by
optimizing the arrangement of charged surface atoms [13].

3.1 Reconstruction mechanisms for ”traditional” semiconductors

We will start our comparison between GaAs and GaN by considering the simplest possible
surface structures - the unreconstructed (1x1) surfaces. These surfaces (Fig. 1) are terminated
either by cations or by anions. For GaAs possible structures are the open (001) surface and the
close-packed (111) (cation-face) and (¯1¯1¯1) (anion-face) surfaces. Since the equilibrium phase of
bulk GaN is the wurtzite structure we performed the calculations for (0001) (cation-face) and
(000¯1) (anion-face) which are equivalent up to the fourth nearest neighbors to the cubic (111)
and (¯1¯1¯1) surfaces. Since we are here only interested in qualitative aspects, we will consider the
(111)/(¯1¯1¯1) and (0001)/(000¯1) as equivalent surfaces.

(0001) and (000¯1) GaN surfaces (solid lines). Note that both the unreconstructed Ga and As
terminated surfaces are very high in energy compared to the equilibrium surfaces (dashed lines).

3.2 Comparison between unreconstructed GaAs and GaN surfaces

The calculated surface energies of GaAs are plotted as a function of the chemical potential in
Fig. 2 (a-c). The energies are fully consistent with the empirical rules and models discussed
above. First, both Ga and As-terminated (1x1) surfaces have much higher surface energies than
the reconstructed equilibrium surfaces implying that the (1x1) surfaces are unstable against
surface reconstruction. This is consistent with the fact that all possible polar (1x1) surfaces
have partially occupied dangling bonds and thus disobey electron counting. Further, consistent
with the principle of reducing the dangling bond density, both the Ga-terminated (111) and the
As-terminated (¯1¯1¯1) surfaces that have only one dangling bond orbital per surface atom (see
Fig. 1b and 1c) are energetically more stable than the corresponding As and Ga-terminated
surfaces that have three dangling-bond orbitals per surface atom.

For GaN (Fig. 2, d-f) some of these mechanisms are no longer valid. First, N-terminated surfaces
are energetically always less stable than the corresponding Ga-terminated surfaces. This result
applies even for the (000¯1) surface where the Ga-terminated surface has three (Fig. 1f) and
the N-terminated surface only one dangling bond orbital per surface atom (Fig. 1c). Second,
the Ga-terminated surfaces have a very low surface energy, which is only slightly higher than
the surface energy of the reconstructed equilibrium surfaces. This is in clear contrast to GaAs
where all unreconstructed surfaces are much higher in energy than the equilibrium structures. In
fact, for (000¯1) the Ga-terminated (1x1) structure (Fig. 1f) becomes the energetically preferred
structure under Ga-rich conditions (see Fig. 2f). This structure, however, obviously disobeys
the electron counting rule.

3.3 Reconstruction mechanisms on GaN surfaces

From these results we can immediately conclude that a major mechanism driving GaN surface
reconstructions is the tendency to stabilize structures that have more Ga than N atoms in
the surface layer. This conclusion is also consistent with recent experimental and theoretical
studies on GaN surface reconstructions [5]. Almost all equilibrium surfaces consist solely of
Ga atoms in the top surface layer. The only exception for polar surfaces is the (0001) surface,
where under nitrogen-rich conditions N-adatoms can be stabilized on a Ga-terminated surface
[5, 26]. This feature of preferring just one species in the top surface layer (independent on
the chemical potentials) is unique to GaN and has not been reported for other semiconductor
surfaces. We will therefore attempt to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the stabilization
of Ga atoms in the surface layer. According to Eq. (2) we can seperate the surface energy into
two contributions: (i) the energy necessary to remove or add atoms to the chemical reservoirs
(which describe the speciﬁc growth conditions) and (ii) the total energy which is the sum over
all bond energies and includes contributions such as charge transfer, electrostatic energy etc.

3.4 Chemical Potentials

Let us ﬁrst focus on the chemical potentials. A lower limit on the energy necessary to remove
atoms from a chemical reservoir is the bulk cohesive energy for solids and the binding energy
per atom for molecules. These energies are shown in Tab. 1 (taken from Ref. [15] for a selected
number of elements). The elements have been chosen to be the constituent species of the major
semiconductor materials. Let us exclude for a moment group IV elements which will be discussed
at the end of Sec. 4.1. Among group II, III, V, and VI elements nitrogen is obviously the element
with the highest binding or cohesive energy: The N-N bond in the N2 molecule is one of the
strongest bonds found in nature. All other atoms have energies roughly between 2 - 3 eV, i.e.
more than 2 eV less than a N atom in the N2 molecule. We can therefore conclude that for
all compound semiconductors (except for group III-Nitrides) there are only modest diﬀerences
in the chemical potentials. For group III-nitrides, however, there is a strong asymmetry in the
chemical potentials: More energy is required to transfer N atoms from the N reservoir to the
surface than to transfer Ga atoms to the surface.

A rough estimate of how this asymmetry aﬀects the energy of the GaN surfaces can be obtained
by artiﬁcially eliminating the large diﬀerence in the chemical reservoirs for Ga and N. We
therefore shift the Ga-chemical potential by the diﬀerence between the N and Ga chemical
potential (2.1 eV). The energy to remove a Ga atom is then the same as removing a N atom
from its chemical reservoir. The corresponding surface energy is shown in Fig. 3 as dashed
line. The energy signiﬁcantly increases (by ∆Echem) bringing the surface energy closer to that
of GaAs.

Figure 3: Surface energies for the unreconstructed Ga-terminated GaN and GaAs surfaces as a
function of the Ga chemical potential. The dashed line corresponds to the Ga-terminated GaN
surface where the diﬀerence between the Ga and N chemical potentials has been eliminated by
artiﬁcially shifting the Ga chemical potential.

3.5 Metallic bonding

The fact, that ∆Echem gives only 2/3 of the diﬀerence with respect to the GaAs surface energy
(Fig. 3) indicates that the diﬀerence in chemical potentials is not suﬃcient to explain the
unusual stability of the Ga-terminated surfaces at GaN. It is also determined by the binding
energy an atom gains if it is incorporated in the surface. The diﬀerent binding energies on both
surfaces can be mainly understood by the formation of second nearest neighbor bonds between
surface Ga atoms. This eﬀect can be roughly estimated by calculating the formation energy of
a free-standing Ga layer at diﬀerent lattice constants. The resulting energies shown in Fig. 4
reveal two interesting aspects: First, the equilibrium lattice constant of the free-standing Ga
layer is close to the lattice constant of GaN bulk. Therefore, the energy the Ga-layer gains when
relaxing from the GaN-bulk lattice constant to its ideal value is modest (0.2 eV). This feature
implies that at GaN surfaces the Ga atoms can form metallic bonds similar to those in bulk Ga
even without any relaxation. Second, by going from the GaAs bulk lattice constant to the GaN
lattice constant the binding energy of the free-standing Ga layer signiﬁcantly decreases (by 0.9
eV). This energy gain explains largely the stronger bonding energy (∆Ebond in Fig. 3) of Ga
atoms on the GaN surface. The energy reduction obtained by contracting the lattice constant
of a Ga adlayer from the GaN-bulk value to the equilibrium value has been invoked to explain
the stability of a laterally contracted incommensurate Ga-adlayer structure on the GaN(0001)
surface[23].

3.6 Chemical trends

The above discussion explains the preference for having exclusively one species in the surface
layer and the tendency to stabilize structures with low-coordinated conﬁgurations that are not
observed for conventional III/V semiconductor surfaces. For these materials, the surface atoms

prefer three-fold coordinated conﬁgurations (i.e. surface atoms have a maximum of one dangling
bond) and the dominant surface species changes when going from cation to anion-rich conditions.
Based on the cohesive energies shown in Tab. 1, we expect similar features (preference of one
species, low-coordinated sites) for the other group III-nitrides (InN, AlN) and also for SiC.

4 Surface reconstructions on GaN surfaces

The arguments given above are general and apply to any polar GaN surface, because speciﬁc
diﬀerences between the various surface orientations were not used. However, as can be seen
in Fig. 1 the local conﬁguration and the number of nearest neighbor bonds at the surface
atoms depend strongly on the surface orientation:
for the (001) surface the atoms are two-
fold coordinated while for the (111) and (¯1¯1¯1) surfaces they form one or three bonds. We will
therefore elucidate in the following how these speciﬁc arrangements aﬀect surface reconstructions
and compare with reconstructions found on GaAs.

4.1 The cubic GaN (001) surface

We will start with the cubic (001) surface. For GaAs, a detailed analysis of STM measurements
by Pashley [11] revealed a set of rules which determine the reconstructions of equilibrium sur-
faces: Surfaces form (2xN ) reconstructions where the 2x periodicity arises from the formation of
dimers and the N periodicity arises from the missing surface dimers. These rules combined with
the electron counting rule largely restrict the number of possible surface structures. Northrup
and Froyen added later the principle of minimizing the electrostatic energy and identiﬁed the
(2x4)-β2 surface (which obeys all the rules) to have the lowest energy under moderately As-rich
conditions [13].

8

In general, dimers are considered to be the natural building block of surface reconstructions
on (001) surfaces and have been observed also for other materials (e.g. AlAs, Si, SiC). The
formation of surface dimers is energetically favorable since it reduces the number of dangling
bond states by a factor of two. More important, due to the speciﬁc arrangement of the atoms
on the (001) surface dimers can be formed simply by rotating the back bonds of the surface
atom without stretching them (see Fig. 5a). While it is apparent that the formation of dimers
is energetically preferred over the unreconstructed surface, it is by no means obvious why other
building blocks than dimers should not be formed. Looking at the driving forces for dimers
these alternative ’building blocks’ should further reduce the number of dangling bonds without
signiﬁcantly stretching the back bonds of the surface atoms. The simplest way to do this is to
form ’n-mers’ instead of dimers where n surface atoms form a linear chain (an example for n
= 4 is shown in Fig. 5b). The number of dangling bonds is then reduced by a factor of 2n/2
= n where 2n is the number of dangling bond states at the unreconstructed surface and 2 the
number of dangling bond states per “n-mer”. For a dimer we obtain thus a factor of 2 while
for a tetramer as shown in Fig. 5b a factor of 4 is achieved: Using these building blocks the
number of dangling bonds at surfaces can be much more eﬃciently reduced than by forming
dimers. The tetramer structure as shown in Fig. 5b has also another remarkable feature. It
obeys electron counting (each of the three bonds in the tetramer holds 2 electrons and the two
remaining dangling bonds are empty/ﬁlled if the tetramer consists of cations/anions). Thus, in
contrast to the dimer structures, which require a combination of dimers and missing dimers in
the surface unit cell, a (1x4) unit cell with a single tetramer is already suﬃcient to fulﬁl the
ECR.

We have therefore performed calculations for a Ga tetramer on GaAs and GaN. For GaAs we
ﬁnd that a tetramer structure is unstable: without any barrier it spontaneously dissociates into
two dimers. The reason for the instability becomes obvious when looking at the geometry as
shown in Fig. 5c. In order to form the Ga-Ga bonds in the tetramer the back bonds of the
outer atoms (marked by dashed lines) have to be stretched by more than 20% implying that
these bonds are virtually broken. For GaAs, the elastic energy necessary to create the tetramer
is larger than the energy gained by reducing the dangling bond density. For GaN, however,
our calculations reveal Ga tetramers to be lower in energy than a structure consisting of two
dimers. In fact, detailed calculations for a large set of possible surface geometries (including
those stable on GaAs surfaces) revealed that the tetramer structure is actually the energetically
preferred structure [4]. From Fig. 5b we see that the Ga-Ga bonds in the tetramer can be
formed almost without stretching the back bonds of the outer atoms: The length of the back
bonds increases only by 5% compared to the unreconstructed surface. The reason is simply
given in terms of geometric ratios. Since the Ga-Ga bond length remains largely independent of
whether the bonds are formed on GaAs or GaN, the stretching of the back bonds and thus the
elastic energy becomes smaller with decreasing lattice constant (see also Fig. 5b). This explains
why tetramers are stable on GaN (alat = 8.49 bohr) but not on GaAs (alat = 10.4 bohr). Based
on these arguments we expect very similar structures for the other group III-nitrides (AlN, InN).

4.2 The closed packed (0001) and (000¯1) GaN sufaces

We will now focus on reconstructions on the close-packed cubic (111) and (¯1¯1¯1) structures which
are equivalent up to 4th nearest neighbors with the wurtzite (0001) and (000¯1) surfaces. A main
diﬀerence of these surfaces with respect to the (001) surface discussed above is the hexagonal
symmetry (C3v) and the lack of a preferred axis along which dimers can be formed. Consequently,
the formation of dimers always destroys the point group symmetry of the surface. In fact, dimer
geometries have never been reported for these surface orientations. Experimental and theoretical
studies showed that surface structures are commonly characterized by the formation of adatom,
trimer and vacancy structures [20]. These structures are usually formed in a (2x2) surface unit
cell and can be shown to obey electron counting [21].

Let us now consider the GaN (0001) surface. As has been pointed out in Sec. 3 the energetically
preferred (1x1) structure is the Ga-terminated surface with one dangling bond state per surface
atom (Fig. 1c). This structure is compatible with the principles of having mainly Ga-atoms in
the surface and a low dangling bond density. However, ﬁrst principles calculations showed that

10

this structure is not stable: (2x2) adatom structures that satisfy the electron counting rule are
lower in energy [5, 26]. These results are also consistent with recent STM investigations, where
mixtures of Ga and N adatoms on these surfaces and semi-insulating behavior have been found
[22].

For GaN (000¯1) the tendency to prefer Ga atoms in the surface layer prevails over all other
principles. A Ga-terminated (1x1) structure becomes energetically most stable despite having
a maximum number of dangling bonds (three per surface atom) and clearly disobeys electron
counting (Fig. 1f). Similarly, on the AlN (000¯1) surface a (1x1) Al-adlayer becomes stable under
Al-rich conditions [24].

5 Conclusions

Based on ﬁrst-principles calculations we have studied the driving forces governing surface recon-
structions on GaN. The principal mechanisms are (i) the tendency to stabilize Ga atoms in the
surface layer, (ii) to obey electron counting and (iii) to reduce the number of dangling bonds.
While (ii) and (iii) are well-known mechanisms driving surface reconstructions on other semi-
conductor materials (i) is a unique property of GaN, and more generally of all group-III-nitrides.
The strong tendency to stabilize Ga-rich surfaces is not only a new property without any ana-
logue among other compound semiconductors but it also prevails over the other principles. The
most extreme example is the (1x1) Ga-adlayer structure shown in Fig. 1f. This is a metallic
structure [5, 23] in which the number of dangling bonds is maximized.

These rules are of course too simplistic to derive a priori, i.e. without input from experiment
or without performing realistic calculations. However, despite their simplicity these rules have
been very successful in explaining or identifying surface reconstructions for a wide range of
semiconductors. The knowledge of these mechanisms is not only important to derive conclusions
concerning surface reconstructions but also about other properties of the surface. For example,
an immediate consequence of the fact that polar GaN surfaces consists mainly of Ga atoms is
a decreasing surface energy when going from N-rich to Ga-rich conditions (see Eq. (2)). This
might explain why the surface morphology of GaN appears to improve when growing under
more Ga-rich conditions [18, 19]. It also explains the exceptionally low diﬀusion barriers of Ga
adatoms on these surfaces (0.2 - 0.6 eV) compared to barriers of 1.5 eV on GaAs [19]: Since the
surface layer is comprised mainly of Ga atoms, the Ga adatom forms primarily Ga-Ga bonds
which are weak compared to the Ga-N bond (metallic Ga melts already at room temperature).
In breaking these bonds to jump from one adsorption site to the next, the Ga adatom must
therefore overcome only a small energy barrier [25].

As has been pointed out in detail in Sec. 3 the origin of the stability of Ga-rich surfaces is (i) the
large diﬀerence in the energies of the chemical reservoirs and (ii) a signiﬁcantly smaller lattice
constant compared to conventional III/V compound semiconductors. We expect therefore a very
similar behavior for the other group III-nitrides, i.e. AlN and InN and their alloys.

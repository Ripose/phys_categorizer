ABSTRACT

Comptonization is the process in which photon spectrum changes due to multiple Compton

scatterings in the electronic plasma. It plays an important role in the spectral formation of
astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray sources. There are several intrinsic limitations for the
analytical method in dealing with the Comptonization problem and Monte Carlo simulation
is one of the few alternatives. We describe an eﬃcient Monte Carlo method that can solve
the Comptonization problem in a fully relativistic way. We expanded the method so that it is
capable of simulating Comptonization in the media where electron density and temperature varies
discontinuously from one region to the other and in the isothermal media where density varies
continuously along photon paths. The algorithms are presented in detail to facilitate computer
code implementation. We also present a few examples of its application to the astrophysical
research.

Introduction

Comptonization – the process where photon spectrum changes due to multiple Compton
scatterings in the electronic plasma – is one of the most important processes in the spectral
generation of X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei and other X-ray and gamma-ray sources. The
analytical treatment of Comptonization are essentially based on the solution of Kompaneets
equation which describes the interactions between radiation ﬁeld and thermal electrons
(Kompaneets 1956). Due to the mathematical complexity, however, previous analysis of
Comptonization depended on simpliﬁcations such as the non-relativistic approximation and
therefore the results were only applicable to a relatively small range of photon and electron
energies (e.g. Sunyaev & Titarchuk 1980). In recent years, Titarchuk (1994) developed a modiﬁed
analytical technique which took into account the relativistic eﬀect and Klein-Nishina corrections,
thereby extending the previous work to wider ranges of temperature and optical depth of the
plasma clouds from which Comptonized photons emerge.

The analytical method, however, have several intrinsic limitations. First, all analytical models

are based on solving certain types of radiation transfer equations (Kompaneets 1956), which in
turn is based on the assumption that energy and position of the photons are continuous functions
of time, i.e. these models assume diﬀusion of photons in the energy and position spaces. While the
continuity of energy change is a good approximation for scatterings at low energy, it is obviously
not valid for Compton scatterings at high photon energies or by relativistic electrons. Similarly, the
continuity of photon position change is an approximation only valid for clouds of electron plasma
with dimensions large compared to the scattering mean free path (i.e. diﬀusion approximation).
But astronomical observations suggest that many of the sources where Comptonization is believed
to take place have optical depths of the order of one Thomson scattering mean free path.

Second, solutions of the radiative transfer equations are based on the separation of photon
diﬀusions in energy and position spaces (Sunyaev & Titarchuk 1980, Titarchuk 1994 and Hua
& Titarchuk 1995). The solutions can be presented in terms of simple analytical expressions
only when initial source photons have energies much lower than the electron energy and follow
a particular spatial distribution, namely, the ﬁrst eigenfunction of the spatial operator of the
diﬀusion equation. It was found (Hua & Titarchuk 1995) that for source photons at energies
not far below the electron energy or for clouds with large optical depth, the emergent spectra
are sensitive to both the spectral and spatial distributions of source photons and the results of
analytical method must be expanded to the higher order terms. Consequently, the analytical
models are applicable only to certain ranges of plasma temperature and optical depth where
solutions are insensitive to source conditions.

Third, the analytical methods are inadequate to treat the temporal behavior of Comptonized

emissions. Hua & Titarchuk (1996) have shown that for relativistic plasma, photons gain
energy signiﬁcantly with each scattering and consequently the scattering mean free path changes
signiﬁcantly with each scattering. Besides, for plasma clouds with small optical depth, the
scattering mean free path are mainly determined by the boundary condition instead of the
scattering cross sections. As a result, analytical treatment (e.g. Payne 1980), is only applicable
to the limited situation in which electron plasma has non-relativistic temperatures and optical
depths much greater than Thomson mean free path.

In addition to the above limitations, analytical approach is totally incapable of dealing with
the Comptonization problems involving complicated geometries and inhomogeneity of electronic
media, where scattering mean free path depends on scattering location and direction as well as
photon energy. But observations seem to indicate that investigations of Comptonization in the
media with non-uniform temperature and density are necessary. As was shown by Skibo et al.
(1995) and Ling et al. (1997), the spectral hardening at high energies in the spectra of AGNs and
black hole candidates may be resulting from the temperature gradient in the plasmas responsible
for the emissions. Kazanas et al. (1997) and Hua et al. (1997) showed that the temporal behavior
such as the hard X-ray phase lags observed from the accreting compact objects may be explained
by the non-uniform electron density of the accreting gas clouds.

– 3 –

These situations are where analytical method fails. As an alternative, Monte Carlo simulation

can be employed to give solutions. It is ﬂexible in simulating various initial conditions of source
photons, complicated geometries and density proﬁles of plasma clouds. It is capable of presenting
the full spectra resulting from Comptonization rather than the asymptotic ones obtainable from
analytical methods. The ﬁrst attempt to use Monte Carlo method to solve Comptonization
problem was by Pozdnyakov et al. (1983). In recent years, Stern et al. (1995) presented a
large-particle Monte Carlo method for simulating Comptonization and other high-energy processes.
Skibo et al. (1995) used a Monte Carlo simulation in the calculation of photon spectra of mildly
relativistic thermal plasmas in pair balance.

In this study, we develop an eﬃcient Monte Carlo method which treats Comptonization
problem in a fully relativistic way and can be implemented in a medium computer such as
Sparc workstation or Pentium PC to yield results with satisfactory statistics in CPU time of the
order of minutes to hours. The algorithms are described in detail to facilitate computer code

2. Compton Scattering on Cold Electrons

The Monte Carlo method described here was developed over the past several years in the
investigations of Compton scattering of 2.223 MeV gamma-ray line in solar ﬂares (Hua 1986),
Compton backscattering of 511 keV annihilation line in the sources 1E1740.7-2942 (Lingenfelter
& Hua 1991) and Nova Muscae (Hua & Lingenfelter 1993).

The diﬀerential cross section of Compton scattering is given by the Klein-Nishina formula

Sampling the distribution given by Eq. (3) plays a central role in the Monte Carlo simulation
of Compton scattering of photons by cold electrons. Furthermore, as will be seen below, Compton
scatterings on hot electrons in our scheme will also be reduced to the simulation of Eq. (3).
Therefore, the performance of the computer program for Monte Carlo simulation of Compton
scatterings depends critically on the quality of the technique used for sampling this distribution
because a run of the program typically involves millions of scatterings. Eﬀorts were made to
optimize the technique of sampling this distribution (e.g. Kahn, 1954). In our implementation,
we adopted a variation of Kahn’s technique ﬁrst suggested by Pei (1979). The algorithm of the
technique is

1. Generate 3 random numbers ξ1, ξ2 and ξ3 uniformly distributed on (0,1).
2. If ξ1

let r = (ε + 1)/(εξ2 + 1).

It is seen that this is essentially a combination of composition and rejection methods (see e.g.
Ripley, 1987). This algorithm, like Kahn’s, avoids the operations such as square root, logarithm
or trigonometric functions, which involve time-consuming series expansion for computers. Its
quality can also be measured to a large extent by the rejection rates, which are 0.38, 0.30, 0.23
and 0.33 for ε = 0.2, 2, 10 and 20 respectively, as compared to 0.41, 0.37, 0.41 and 0.53 for Kahn’s
technique. The improvement is signiﬁcant, especially for higher photon energies.

3. Comptonization in Hot Isothermal Homogeneous Plasmas

The Monte Carlo technique for photon Comptonization in a relativistic plasma was outlined

by Pozdnyakov et al. (1983) and Gorecki & Wilczewski (1984). Our implementation of the
simulation is somewhat diﬀerent from these authors. It was developed on the bases of the
technique for Compton scattering on cold electrons described in the last section.

Suppose a photon is scattered oﬀ an electron which is moving in z-axis direction with a
velocity v. The energies of the incident and the scattered photon are E and E′ respectively. The

– 5 –

zenith angles of the incident and scattered photons measured from z-axis are θ and θ′ respectively.
φ and φ′ are the azimuthal angles. The diﬀerential cross section for Compton scattering is given
by (see e.g. Akhiezer & Berestetskii 1969)

where µ = cos θ and µ′ = cos θ′; v is in units of the speed of light and γ = (1

It is seen that Eq. (9) is identical in form with Eq. (1). But the quantity ε here is given by the
relativistic expression in Eq. (7). In other words, it is dependent on the electron’s energy and
direction as well as photon’s energy.

A photon with energy E traveling in a plasma with an isotropic distribution of electrons
having an energy distribution Ne(γ) will have an averaged cross section of Compton scattering
(see e.g. Landau & Lifshits, 1976):

For a plasma in thermal equilibrium, Ne(γ) is the Maxwell distribution given by

matrix, obtained by the 2-dimensional integration in Eq. (10) for a properly spaced array of Te
and E, can be read by or incorporated into the computer codes. Values of σa(Te, E) for several

temperatures are numerically calculated and plotted in Figure 1. The dashed curve in the ﬁgure is
the cross section at Te = 0, given by the Klein-Nishina formula in Eq. (1). It can be seen that for
energetic photons scattering oﬀ the high temperature electrons, the cross section can be smaller by
a factor of 2 or more than oﬀ the cold electrons. In other words, hot plasmas are more transparent
than cold ones for photons. This has important eﬀect on the energy spectra emerging from such
plasmas, which Titarchuk (1994) took into account in his modiﬁcation of the previous analytical
results. Its eﬀect on the temporal behavior of X-ray and gamma-ray emission from these plasma
is even more signiﬁcant and was discussed in Hua & Titarchuk (1996).

With σa(Te, E) obtained by numerical integration in Eq. (10), we can use the Monte Carlo

method to select the free path between two successive scatterings for a photon with energy E.

only concerned with the isothermal plasmas at temperature Te and with uniform density ne and
leave the discussion about inhomogeneous media to the next two sections. Under this assumption,
ℓ can be sampled simply by

while its azimuthal angle φ around the photon direction is selected uniformly on (0, 2π). The
distribution in Eq. (14) is rather complicated because ε depends on γ and µ as given in Eq. (7).
On the other hand, for a thermal plasma, Ne(γ) is given by Eq. (11) and independent of µ. In our

Several points should be made in the above algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 sample γ using rejection
method in terms of the Maxwellian distribution Ne(γ), which is independent of the photon energy
and direction. For low plasma temperature (Θ
0.01) electron velocity v are sampled according
≤
to the non-relativistic Maxwellian distribution. For high temperatures, the separated sampling
(Θ
0.25 and > 0.25) is in order to reduce the rejection rates. It should be emphasized that
although the expressions of H1 and H2 are complicated, these quantities depend on Θ alone and
therefore need to be calculated once only. They can be calculated outside the scattering loop
as long as plasma temperature remains unchanged. The γ values so sampled, together with the
isotropically sampled µ, represent electrons in the hot plasma at the given temperature. They
are subject to another rejection test in the subsequent steps in order to yield the right joint
distribution given in Eq. (14), which represents the electrons that actually scatter the photon.

temperature remains unchanged. The γ values so obtained are subject to another rejection
test in the subsequent steps together with the isotropically sampled µ in order to yield the right
joint distribution given in Eq. (14).

The quantity H3 is not expressible analytically. It depends on incident photon energy E only
and can be determined by maximizing the eﬀective cross section with respect to γ and µ for any
given E using numerical methods such as given in Press et al. (1992). In the following, we describe
an alternative to the above 2-dimensional maximization methods. We examine the derivative of

Therefore, σeﬀ (γ, µ) is a monotonously decreasing function of µ, that is, for given γ, σeﬀ (γ, µ)
reaches its maximum at µ =
1. Physically, this means that head-on collision between the photon
and electron always has the maximum probability. Thus, in order to determine the maximum of
σeﬀ as a function of γ and µ, one only needs to maximize the one dimensional function σeﬀ (γ,
1).
−
The maximum of σeﬀ , or H3, as a function of E determined in this way is plotted in Figure 1
as the dash-dotted curve. It is seen that for high photon energies, the maximum eﬀective cross
section approaches the Klein-Nishina cross section while at low energies it approaches twice the
Thomson cross section. The H3 values for an array of properly spaced E values can be tabulated
and incorporated into the computer codes.

With the selected electron energy and direction represented by γ, µ and φ uniform on (0, 2π),

we proceed to determine the energy and direction of the scattered photon. In order to do so,

– 9 –

we simulate Compton scattering in the frame where the electron before scattering is at rest
rather than sampling the multivariate distribution of E′, µ′ and φ′ from Eq. (5). The Lorentz
transformation of the photon momentum between this reference frame and the lab frame is given
by

where p and p′ are photon momentum vectors before and after the transformation; ˆp and ˆv are
unit vectors of the photon momentum and electron velocity respectively.

In the electron rest frame, we utilize the Monte Carlo method described in

2. The resulting
§
momentum of the scattered photon is then transformed back to the lab frame using the same Eq.
(20) with a reversed ˆv. The energy and direction of the scattered photon obtained in this way
automatically satisfy the energy conservation relationship given in Eq. (8).

As a crucial test we ran the program in which low frequency photons were allowed to scatter
in an inﬁnite plasma at a given temperature for a suﬃciently long time. It was expected that the
photon energy should approach the Wien distribution at the given plasma temperatures. One
example of such evolution, the photon energy distribution recorded at varies times in a plasma of
kTe = 200 keV are shown in Figure 2. It does approach the Wien form.

4. Comptonization in Multi-Zone Media

If Comptonization takes place in a medium which is divided into several zones each with

diﬀerent electron temperatures and density distributions, one has to take into consideration the
boundaries between these zones in addition to the scattering free paths and the boundary of the
entire medium.

In general, suppose a photon, after initiation or scatterings, is located in the medium at
(x0, y0, z0) with a direction (ω1, ω2, ω3). The next position where the photon will scatter, if there
were no boundaries, is given by

x1 = x0 + ℓω1
y1 = y0 + ℓω2
z1 = z0 + ℓω3,






(21)

where ℓ is sampled according to Eq. (13), in which ne and Te should be understood as the electron
density and temperature in the present zone. With the existence of boundaries, (x1, y1, z1) could
be in the neighboring zone or outside of the medium. In this case, one has to calculate the
distances si from (x0, y0, z0) to various boundaries Bi, (i = 1, ..., N ), where N is the number of
boundaries surrounding the zone under consideration. si can be obtained by solving the equations
describing the ith boundary

Bi(x, y, z) = 0,

i = 1, ..., N

If ℓ is smaller than any of s1, ...sN so obtained, the photon will remain in the same zone and
scatter at the location (x1, y1, z1) on electrons at local temperature Te. But if sj is the minimum
among ℓ and s1, ...sN , the photon will hit the boundary Bj. In this case one has to replace the
photon on the boundary at (x, y, z) determined by Eq. (23) with i = j. With the new position on
the boundary as (x0, y0, z0), one can begin another round of free path sampling with ne and Te of
the zone the photon is entering but keeping the photon energy and direction unchanged.

In the study of Gamma-ray spectra of Cygnus X-1 (Ling et al. 1997), we developed a model

where photons scatter in a two-layered spherical plasma consisting of a high-temperature core
and a cooler corona. The model was ﬁrst proposed by Skibo and Dermer (1995) to interpret the

X-ray spectral hardening at high energies observed in AGNs. The boundary of the inner core is a
sphere of radius Ri while the boundaries of the outer shell are two spheres with radii Ri and Ro
respectively. For a photon in the core, the equation for the distance s1 to its boundary is

where r0 = (x0, y0, z0) is the position vector of the photon; ˆω = (ω1, ω2, ω3). Similarly, the
equations for a photon in the outer shell are

In ﬁgure 3, we present the result of such a calculation (solid curve) together with the
observational data (Ling et al. 1997) it was intended to ﬁt. The data was from the blackhole
candidate Cygnus X-1 observed by the detector BATSE on board satellite Compton Gamma-Ray
Observatory. The ﬁtting spectrum was obtained from a calculation with the two-layer model
described above, where temperature is kTe = 230 keV for the inner core and 50 keV for the outer
shell. The two zones are assumed to have the same electron density and the inner core has a
radius 0.36 in units of Thomson mean free path, while the outer-shell radius is 1.3. The initial
photons have a blackbody temperature of 0.5 keV and injected into the medium from outside. For
comparison the best ﬁt one can achieve by a single-zone plasma model is also presented (dashed
curve). The model consists of a plasma sphere of radius 1.35 at kTe = 85 keV. The reduced χ2

– 12 –

value is 2.6 for the single-temperature model as compared to 1.0 for the double-layer model. It is
seen that by adding a hot central core to the Comptonization medium, the ﬁt to the high-energy
part of the observed spectrum is signiﬁcantly improved.

5. Comptonization in Isothermal Media with Non-Uniform Density

The media we considered so far are uniform, at least regionally, in density. It was found

necessary to investigate the Comptonization in the media with non-uniform density proﬁles
(Kazanas et al, 1997). In this section, we present the treatment of two spherically symmetrical
conﬁguration commonly found in astrophysical environment, one with electron density varying
as ρ−1 and the other as ρ−3/2, where ρ is the distance from the sphere center. The latter case
represents the density proﬁle of a gas free-falling onto a central accreting object under gravitational
force (e.g. Narayan & Yi 1994), while the former represents that of an accreting gas with viscosity
due to the interaction between the gas and the outgoing photons (Kazanas et al, 1997).

Once ℓ is available, one can use the algorithms described in the previous section to determine if

We used ℓ given in Eqs. (29) and (35) to study the Comptonization in a two-layer spherical
model similar to that in the last section but with the outer layer having a ρ−1 or ρ−3/2 density
proﬁle. Speciﬁcally, we assume the density in the outer shell is given by Eq. (27) with ρ0 = Ri
and the density of the inner core is constant n+. It is found that the energy spectrum of the
X-rays emerging from such system is diﬀerent from a uniform sphere with the same optical depth
(Kazanas et al, 1997). More importantly, with the decreasing density proﬁles, the outer layer, or
the “atmosphere” can extend to a distance much greater than the size a uniform system with the
same optical depth can do, giving rise to the time variation properties on a much greater time
scale.

As an example, we show in Figure 4 two light curves, or the time-dependent ﬂuxes, for X-ray
photons escaping from two such core-atmosphere systems, one with ρ−1 and the other with ρ−3/2
density proﬁle for the atmospheres. For both density proﬁles, the temperature is 50 keV in the
atmosphere as well as in the core; the total optical depth is 2 in terms of Thomson scattering
10−4 light seconds. The core density n+
and the radius of the inner cores is assumed to be 2
1017cm−3 for ρ−1 and ρ−3/2 proﬁles
is slightly diﬀerent from each other: 1.6
1017cm−3
respectively. For the outer atmospheres, n0 in Eq. (27) are 0.4
respectively. As a result the radii of the systems are 1.01 and 2.63 light seconds respectively.

Photons of a blackbody spectrum at temperature 2 keV are injected at the center into the

system. The Comptonized photons in the energy range 10
20 keV are collected in terms of their
escape time, producing the light curves displayed in the ﬁgure. It is seen that these light curves are
power-laws extending to the order of seconds followed by exponential cutoﬀs. The indices of the
power-law are roughly 1 and 3/2 respectively, which was explained in Kazanas et al (1997). This

temporal behavior is greatly diﬀerent from the light curves from a uniform system, which decay
exponentially from the very beginning of the emissions (Hua & Titarchuk, 1996). In addition,
for a uniform system of the similar optical depth and an electron density of the order of 1016 or
1017cm−3, the characteristic decay time of the light curves will be
1 millisecond. The implication
of the prolonged power-law light curves resulting from the extended atmosphere models for the
interpretation of the recent X-ray observational data is discussed elsewhere (Kazanas et al. 1997,
Hua et al. 1997).

6. Summary

We have shown that analytical method has intrinsic limitations in dealing with Comptonization
problem and Monte Carlo simulation provides a useful alternative. We have introduced an eﬃcient
Monte Carlo method that can solve the Comptonization problem in a truly relativistic way. The
method was further expanded to include the capabilities of dealing with Comptonization in the

– 16 –

media where electron density and temperature vary discontinuously from one region to the other
and in the isothermal media where density varies continuously along photon paths. In addition
to the examples given above for its application, the method was also used in the investigation
of Compton scattering of gamma-ray photons in the accretion disks near black hole candidates
(Lingenfelter & Hua, 1991) and in the Earth’s atmosphere and the spacecraft material (Hua &
Lingenfelter, 1993).

and NAS/NRC for support during the period of this study.

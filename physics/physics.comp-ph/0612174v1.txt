Abstract

Computational tools for normal mode analysis, which are widely used in physics
and materials science problems, are designed here in a single package called NMscatt
(Normal Modes & scattering) that allows arbitrarily large systems to be handled.
The package allows inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering observables to be calcu-
lated, allowing comparison with experimental data produced at large scale facilities.
Various simpliﬁcation schemes are presented for analysing displacement vectors,
which are otherwise too complicated to understand in very large systems.

1 Introduction

At large scale facilities for neutron and X-ray scattering, large quantities of ex-
perimental data are produced. For complex, nanoscale systems, understanding
this data requires computer models. In the case of inelastic scattering, molec-
ular dynamics (MD) simulations [1] are widely used to equilibrate structures

and explore dynamics as a function of temperature and other experimen-
tal parameters. However MD only gives a partial description of vibrational
modes through the partial density of states and when knowledge about spe-
ciﬁc vibrational modes is required, normal mode analysis (NMA) [2] has to
be performed. For physics and materials science problems, NMA gives a de-
scription of the lattice dynamics via the dispersion (k-vector dependence) of
the mode frequencies [3]. For small systems (< 200 atoms in the simulation
box) very accurate results can be obtained using density functional theory
(DFT) methods to determine interatomic force constants [4,5]. By combining
DFT and software that constructs and diagonalises the dynamical matrix and
calculates the experimental observables, experimentalists now have sophisti-
cated tools to analyse their data. The PHONON [6] package is one of the best
examples.

Phonon codes are traditionally limited to small systems for a number of rea-
sons. For example, for small unit cells, the reciprocal lattice is big and stronger
eﬀects of dispersion are expected. If DFT methods are used to determine
force constants then these methods are themselves restricted to a few hun-
dred atoms. However the development of nanoscale structures of (partially)
crystalline materials stimulates a need for phonon codes to be extended to
much larger systems. Parameterised force ﬁelds [7] can be used to determine
the inter-atomic force constants and, as will be seen in the example presented
here, strong dispersion eﬀects are observed inspite of the small reciprocal lat-
tice.

In biomolecular systems, the need for NMA has long been recognised and codes
like CHARMM [8] allow the gamma point normal modes to be calculated for
moderately big systems. In addition, the neutron scattering quantities can be
directly calculated from the simulations using the time-correlation function
formalism [9], as implemented in the nMOLDYN program [10]. A combina-
tion of neuton scattering experiments and atomic detail computer simulations
has proven to be a powerful technique for studying internal molecular vi-
brations [11,12,13]. In this approach one can validate the applied numerical
models, i.e. force ﬁeld parametrizations, depending on the agreement between
the experimental and calculated spectra.

In this paper we present a software package that extends the functionality
of codes like PHONON [6] and Climax [14] to arbitrarily large systems and
extends the gamma point only analysis already available for larger systems
to include k-vector dependence. The software reads a Hessian matrix of force
constants, constructs and diagonalises the dynamical matrix for any k-vector
and calculates neutron and X-ray scattering observables. The computational
bottleneck remains the diagonalisation of correspondingly large dynamical ma-
trices and we comment on approximations that have to be used when the Bril-
louin zone cannot be sampled at a large number of points. In large systems,

2

atomistic detail in the displacement vectors can be diﬃcult to interpret due
to the large number of degrees of freedom and we present two methods for
simplifying this information. The ﬁrst entails summing displacement vectors
over atoms in user-deﬁned beads, while the second involves a reduction of the
degrees of freedom in the dynamical matrix by summing over force constants,
which has the advantage of reducing the number of modes to be examined.

2 Theoretical background

The standard approach, also called a direct method [15], to the lattice vibra-
tion problem of crystals is based on the explicit knowledge of the interaction
between all atom-pairs in the system. Subsequently, one deduces the corre-
sponding force constants, and constructs and diagonalizes the dynamical ma-
trix for any k-vector in order to obtain the frequencies of the normal modes. A
reasonable atomic detail description of interactions within large biomolecular
systems are provided using empirical force ﬁelds.

In the following we will brieﬂy summarize the aspects of the classical theory
of lattice vibrations [16] and proceed to the description of the explicit phonon
calculations.

The individual atomic positions in the crystal can be assigned as

~Rnµ(t) = ~Rn + ~rµ + ~unµ(t),

(1)

where ~Rn is unit cell lattice vector and ~unµ(t) is displacement of atom µ from its
equilibrium positions ~rµ. Within the harmonic approximation we concentrate
on expansion of the small diﬀerences of potential energy V due to the small
changes in atom positions:

(α, β = x, y, z)

As each unit cell is identical to every other unit cell in the crystal, the dis-
placement pattern of a normal mode has to be identical to that in any other

cell to within a phase diﬀerence ~k( ~Rn − ~Rm). The representation of the atom
displacement is chosen to be a plain wave ansatz of the form:

~unµ(~k, t) =

~eµ~k exp(i[~k ~Rn − ω~kt]),

where ~eµ~k is the polarization vector and Mµ is the mass of the atom µ. We
omit writing Cartesian component subscripts. Solving the equation of motion

is the so called dynamical matrix.

The form of the dynamical matrix (6) requires the atom pairs for which one
atom belongs to a diﬀerent unit cell, i.e. (m 6= n), to be identiﬁed. These
terms contribute to the so called Bloch-factor exp[i~k( ~Rm − ~Rn)] and make the
dynamical matrix complex. But in case of applying periodic boundary condi-
tions (PBC) as implemented in computer simulation programs, the potential
energy of a crystal is given as an explicit function of only the atom positions in
the primary unit cell. As a consequence, we obtain the second derivative ma-
trix H in which the contributions from the inter-cell atomic pairs are mapped
and added to the corresponding image atom pairs in the primary unit cell:

One can directly obtain Dnµα,mνβ by increasing the size of the unit cell by
one or more layers of periodically arranged image cells and calculate force
constants in the extended supercell. However, this approach is unfavourable
when dealing with very large systems.

A similar approach is to decompose the potential energy V P BC in equation (7)
into individual contributions from the image cells, V P BC = V0 +
m Vm and
evaluate the second derivative matrix for each term upon the same minimized
structure.

P

The situation is simpler if the interaction is truncated at some cutoﬀ distance
rcut so that the “minimum image convention” (MIC) is obeyed. The MIC

4

states that each atom interacts at most with one image of every other atom in
the system (which is repeated to fully enclose the primary unit cell with the
periodic boundary conditions). This has the eﬀect of limiting the interaction
cutoﬀ, for example, to no more than half the length of the minimum side
when simulating the orthorhombic cell, rcut < min{a/2, b/2, c/2}. It should
be noted that the size of nanoscale crystals usually far exceeds the spatial range
of forces between atoms (∼ <12 ˚A) allowing physically reasonable cutoﬀ radii
to be introduced.

Fig. 1. A 2D periodic system representing the eﬀect of the minimum image con-
vention while constructing dynamical matrix. If a distance between atom ν (hollow
blue circle) and µ (full black circle) is larger than the cut-oﬀ distance (red circle
around the atom µ), and if the force constant Hµν turns out to be nonzero, it means
that the value of Hµν has to be related to the atom ν in the image cell m (full blue
circle), with the position vector ~rν + ~lx (~lx = ~Rm − ~Rn), instead of to the atom
~rν in the primary cell n. The corresponding lattice translation vector ~lx is thus
determined for the element Hµν.

According to the MIC we can conclude that there is always only one translation
~t per atom pair (ν, µ) giving rise to the minimum distance |(~rν + ~t) − ~rµ|:

∃sα = {−1, 0, 1}α=1,2,3 : ~t = s1~l1 + s2~l2 + s3~l3;

so that:

|(~rν + ~t) − ~rµ| = min,

where ~lα are lattice translation vectors, c.f. Fig. 1. In the case of a nonvanishing

Inelastic scattering

The dynamic structure factor S(~q, ω) contains information about the structure
and dynamics of the sample. It can be split into a coherent part arising from
the cross-correlations of atomic motions and an incoherent part describing
self-correlations of single atom motions. According to the standard theory
[17,18], which is based on the harmonic approximation, we obtain the following

3 Analysing the displacement vectors

For systems containing thousands of atoms (N) the displacement vectors ob-
tained by diagonalising the dynamical matrix can be diﬃcult to understand,
especially for low frequency modes which involve the displacement of many
(or all) atoms. One simple solution to this problem is to sum over the dis-
placements of atoms within beads, which represent logical coarse grains of the
system, for example base molecules in the DNA example below. This treatment
allows diﬀerent bead deﬁnitions to be applied to the calculated displacement
vectors but has the disadvantage of not reducing the number of displacement
vectors from 3N.

A related approach is to reduce the atomic level Hessian matrix to lower
dimension by mapping the inter-atomic force constants on to inter-bead force
constants [19]. For N’ beads, the resulting dynamical matrices have dimension
3N’ and therefore result in 3N’ displacement vectors for any k-vector. We
note that any reduction in the dimensionality of the system causes a loss in

bodies).

4 Example

To verify the implemented formalism we have simulated a B-form DNA molecule
(right-handed, 10 base-pairs per turn, pitch 33.6˚A) using CHARMM [8]. The
full crystal environment was generated using periodic boundary conditions for
an orthorhombic unit cell containing one helix of DNA. The dimension of the
unit cell is a = 32.2˚A, b = 31.8˚A and c = 33.5˚A, with c parallel to the helical
axis. The starting conﬁguration was obtained by minimization of the potential
energy of the crystal structure obtained as the time average over a 1ns MD
simulation at 100K. The Hessian matrix of force constants was generated by
displacing each atom in turn from equilibrium and calculating the forces in-
duced on all other atoms. Diagonalisation of the resulting dynamical matrices
was performed using the the routine zcheev from the LAPACK library [20].

The typical coherent spectrum of DNA, Figure 2, obtained from equation
10, shows a well-deﬁned Brillouin peak at small ω which moves along the
frequency dimension upon varying momentum transfer ~q. Fitting the spectral
proﬁle with a Gaussian as a function of wave-vector gives the dispersion curve
shown in Figure 3, which compares well with the recent experimental results
[21]. Figure 3 also shows the result of the equivalent analysis of a 300K MD
simulation on the same model of B-DNA using nMoldyn.

In order to gain insight into the nature of low frequency dynamics we can
analyse the displacement vectors at an atomic level (see Figure 4(a) for an
acoustic mode). By summing over the displacement vectors in terms of beads,
where base molecules, sugar molecules and phosphate groups are treated as
single units, a simpliﬁed picture of the normal modes is obtained. Figure 4(b)
shows a high frequency mode which has a pronounced contribution from the
phosphate groups.

5 Conclusion

The new, user-friendly computational package NMscatt presented here enable
an eﬃcient atomic detail analysis of diﬀerent types of inelastic scattering ap-
plied to arbitrarily large nanoscale systems. The ability to perform molecular
dynamics and phonon calculations on large nano and bio-molecular materi-
als means that one can eﬃciently pursue the investigation of some poorly
understood structural and dynamical features of these systems.

A Program package and data structure

There are four main modules in the NMscatt program package phonon, coh,
incoh and bead, and the overall NMscatt structure is given in Figure A.1. Below
are described the corresponding modules.

• phonon: Providing the full Hessian matrix for a given energy-minimized
atomic structure within the speciﬁed crystallographic unit cell this module
constructs dynamical matrix and calculates its eigenvalues and eigenvec-
tors at given wave vector ~k. At input this module requires to specify the
Bravais lattice vectors that were previously used in the molecular mechan-
ics/dynamics simulation package to satisfy the periodic boundary conditions
while generating the minimized structure. The cut-oﬀ radius must be given

10

at which the long range interactions are truncated while calculating the Hes-
sian matrix in the simulation. At output two separate ﬁles eig val n and
eig vec n are written containing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively,
where n assigns a consecutive number of the sampling k-point in the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone. These ﬁles serve as an imput for other modules of NMscatt.
The choice n = 0 is assumed to be reserved for the Γ-point, ~k = (0, 0, 0). The
lowest n should sample the vicinity of the Γ-point. The k-points are to be
speciﬁed in the fractional coordinates with respect to the reciprocal lattice
vectors. The elements of the upper triangle of the hessian matrix should be
provided in the binary (default) hessian uf or alternatively in the ASCII
ﬁle hessian f and the atomic coordinates in the ﬁle coord writen in the
CHARMM coordinate format.

• incoh: This module allows to calculate atomic Debye-Waller factors repre-
senting the mean square displacements and dynamical structure factor of
incoherent one-phonon neutron scattering on monocrystals and from orien-
tationally averaged powder. In the latter case we need to specify an abso-
lute value of momentum transfer q, range of the k-point index n: 0 − nmax
for picking up the corresponding k-point eigenvalues- and eigenvectors-ﬁles
generated by phonon, number of random orientations of q vector to provide
spherical averaging and absolute temperature. Also, one has to deﬁne the
k-point index na, for which the k-point range 0 − na corresponds to the
linear regime of the acoustic-mode-dispersion curves. This is needed for the
proper derivation of Debye-Waller factors using Debye approximation. As
a result, the function S(q, ω) is given in the ﬁle s q w. Optionally, one can
also obtain density of states (DOS) in this module.

• coh: This module calculates dynamical structure factor of coherent one-
phonon neutron or X-ray scattering on monocrystals. In addition to the
input data required by incoh (except for the spherical averaging), we need
to deﬁne for module coh also the type of scattering neutron/X-ray, the
number of higher Brillouin zones included for sampling momentum transfer
vector, and the range of the k-point index n1 − n2 evaluated by module
phonon and assigning the k-points in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, which lie along
the selected direction of the momentum transfer vector ~q. As a result, the
function S(q, ω) is given in the ﬁle s qw coh.

• bead: This module is used to enable visualization of selected vibrational
modes obtained by running phonon for the Γ-point, such that atomic dis-
placement vectors are projected on to the beads, which are deﬁned as the
center of mass of larger atomic groups of the system, for example residues.
The output ﬁles are readable by the program xmakemol[22] which enables
direct visualisation of the mode.

Compiling

To compile the program package Makeﬁle is provided. It is important to note
that 64-bits processors are prerequisite for applying the NMscatt to analy-
sis of the large systems (containing more than 2000 atoms). One needs to
install the LAPACK library on the computer beforehand, prior to NMscatt.
The fortran compiling switches g77 -mcmodel=medium -funroll-all-loops
-fno-f2c -O3 are recomended when installed on 64-bits processors running
Linux.

Benchmark results

Bencmark results were obtained on AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Proces-
sor 2.2GHz running Linux for B-form DNA simulated with the CHARMM
program.

Mathematical Aspects of Numerical Solution
of Hyperbolic Systems

A. G. Kulikovskii1, N. V. Pogorelov2, and A. Yu. Semenov3

Abstract. A number of physical phenomena are described by nonlinear hyper-
bolic equations. Presence of discontinuous solutions motivates the necessity of
development of reliable numerical methods based on the fundamental math-
ematical properties of hyperbolic systems. Construction of such methods for
systems more complicated than the Euler gas dynamic equations requires the
investigation of existence and uniqueness of the self-similar solutions to be
used in the development of discontinuity-capturing high-resolution numerical
methods. This frequently necessitates the study of the behavior of disconti-
nuities under vanishing viscosity and dispersion. We discuss these problems
in the application to the magnetohydrodynamic equations, nonlinear waves
in elastic media, and electromagnetic wave propagation in magnetics.

1. Introduction

In this paper we discuss the mathematical aspects of the problems originating in
the solution of nonlinear systems of hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equations. These
equations describe a large variety of physical phenomena, such as, gasdynamics,
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), shallow water equations, elasticity equations, etc.
Being nonlinear, these systems usually require numerical methods for their solu-
tion. Presence of discontinuous solutions motivates the necessity of the develop-
ment of reliable numerical methods based on the fundamental mathematical prop-
erties of hyperbolic systems. Although such methods are rather well developed for
the Euler gasdynamic equations in the conservation law form, their extension to
more complicated hyperbolic systems is not straightforward. It requires a math-
ematical justiﬁcation of the solution uniqueness, a formulation of the selection
principles for relevant solutions, and, ﬁnally, an investigation of their physical va-
lidity. Most of high-resolution methods for gasdynamic equations use the exact
or some of the approximate self-similar Riemann problem solutions to determine
ﬂuxes through the computational cell surfaces. Similar methods are expected to be
developed for various types of hyperbolic systems. In this case we must construct
the elementary self-similar solution using only admissible discontinuities (entropy
consistent, evolutionary, etc.). Basically the choice of the solution must be made

on the basis of the structure of the solution of the extended problem [14]. All men-
tioned above makes very important the study of discontinuous solutions behavior
under vanishing viscosity and dispersion to create a proper background for the
development of high-resolution numerical methods for hyperbolic systems more
complicated than the Euler equations of gasdynamics. We discuss several analyti-
cal and numerical solutions in the mentioned ﬁelds which illustrate the complexity
of the selection problem and outline the methods of its solution.

2. High-resolution methods for MHD equations

TVD upwind and symmetric diﬀerencing schemes have recently become very eﬃ-
cient tool for solving complex multi-shocked gasdynamic ﬂows. This is due to their
robustness for strong shock wave calculations. The extension of these schemes to
the equations of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics is not simple. First, the exact
solution [16] of the MHD Riemann problem is too multivariant to be used in regu-
lar calculations. Second, several diﬀerent approximate solvers [1], [6], [7], [9], [12],
[18], and [23] applied to MHD equations are now at the stage of investigation and
comparison. This investigation requires i) determination of a proper slope limiting
method in the parameter interpolation procedure necessary to obtain nonoscil-
latory schemes of the order of accuracy higher than one; ii) development of an
eﬃcient entropy correction method necessary to exclude rarefaction shocks; and,
ﬁnally, iii) solution of the problem of excluding the origin of nonevolutionary so-
lutions in ideal MHD calculations.

The system of governing equations for a MHD ﬂow of an ideal, inﬁnitely
conducting, perfect plasma in the Cartesian coordinate system x, y, z with the
use of the conventional notations reads (one ﬂuid approximation):

vectors.

This form of the system can be used to satisfy the divergence-free condi-
tion by convecting away the magnetic charge from the computational region [23].
Otherwise, any other well-known method can be used to eliminate the magnetic
charge.

To determine a numerical ﬂux ¯E = n1E + n2F + n3G normal to the compu-
tational cell boundary (n = (n1, n2, n3) is a unit outward vector normal to the cell
surface) one can use the formulas based on the solution of the linearized problem

In pure gas dynamics the uniform average vector ¯U(UL, UR) can be con-
structed in such a way that the conservation relations on shocks are exactly satis-
ﬁed. The important peculiarity of the latter method is that, although it gives the
solution of the linearized problem, the exact satisfaction of the Rankine–Hugoniot
relations on shocks provides their more adequate and sharp resolution [24].

In [7] the MHD numerical Jacobian matrix was used frozen at the point ob-
tained by the arithmetic average between UR and UL. Thus, it could not guarantee
the exact satisfaction of the conservation condition at the jump. This approach
belongs to the general conservative Courant–Isaacson–Rees family.

The reason of the former averaging for the MHD equations is explained by the
fact that there is no single averaging procedure to ﬁnd a frozen Jacobian matrix
of the system. Another linearization approach is used in [1], [12], [18] in which the
linearized Jacobian matrix is not a function of a single averaged set of variables,
but depends in a complicated way on the variables on the right- and on the left-
hand side of the computational cell surface. In [19] and [20] this procedure was
shown to be nonunique. A multiparametric family of linearized MHD approximate
Riemann problem solutions was presented that assured an exact satisfaction of
the conservation relations on discontinuities. A proper choice of parameters is
necessary to avoid physically inconsistent solutions.

It is widely known that the interpolation method used to determine parameter
values at the cell surfaces can greatly improve the quality of numerical results. Let
us introduce the mesh function Un
i = U(n∆t, i∆x). We shall use as an example
the following interpolation approach [6]:

The choice η =

1 and ω = 1 gives a popular “min mod” method which
usually eliminates spurious oscillations near discontinuities. On the other hand, the
application of more compressive slope limiters is widely accepted in gas dynamics
for ﬁner resolution of contact discontinuities. In MHD the same is important for
rotational (Alfv´enic) discontinuities. We can suppose the choice η = 1
3 (the third-
order upwind-biased interpolation) and ω = 2 to give better results. Consider as

the speciﬁc heat ratio γ = 1.4. The solution of this problem contains all types
of MHD shocks propagating through the both halves of the computational region
separated by the contact discontinuity [6]. The distribution of the Bz component
of the magnetic ﬁeld vector is presented for t = 0.15 (400 cells were taken between
0 and 1). One can clearly see in Fig. 1 the numerical noise attendant in this case
in the vicinity of strong shocks, which is similar to that being suppressed by the
artiﬁcial viscosity in [9].

−

If one decides, however, to choose η = 1 (three-point central diﬀerencing
scheme) these oscillations disappear (Fig. 2). This result seems to have no analogue
in purely gas dynamic calculations and speaks in favor of the application of the
central schemes rather than upwind ones.

Talking about the Roe-type solvers for MHD, it is worth noting that appli-
cation of the one-dimensional solver for multidimensional calculations even with
the use of Powell’s technique [23] cannot guarantee the exact satisfaction of the
Rankine–Hugoniot conditions due to the presence of the artiﬁcial source term.

This makes questionable the necessity of utilization of the very complicated and
time consuming algorithms like [19]. Our experience based on the solution of sev-
eral one-dimensional and two-dimensional test problems shows that the scheme [7]
gives essentially the same accuracy.

Another important thing of discussion is that certain initial and boundary
value problems can be solved nonuniquely using diﬀerent shocks or combination
of shocks, whereas physically one would expect only unique solutions. The situa-
tion diﬀers from that in pure gasdynamics where all entropy increasing solutions
are evolutionary and physically relevant. Contrary to pure gasdynamics, in the
MHD case the condition of the entropy increase is necessary but not suﬃcient.
Only slow and fast MHD shocks are evolutionary, while intermediate shocks are
to be excluded. Although in the ideal MHD a nonevolutionary shock decomposi-
tion into evolutionary ones occurs instantaneously under action of an inﬁnitesimal
perturbation, this decomposition in the presence of numerical dissipation can re-
quire some time which depends on the numerical scheme and grid resolution [6].
From this viewpoint the question arises whether the schemes are applicable which
use one-dimensional coplanar Riemann problem solution to determine numerical
ﬂuxes at cell interfaces. Among the schemes mentioned above only [9] eﬀectively

6

Kulikovskii, Pogorelov, and Semenov

incorporates Alfv´enic shocks into the ﬂux determination procedure. On the other
hand, it is well known that boundary conditions for rotational perturbations in
MHD split from the full set of boundary conditions on the shock. That is why, the
evolutionarity properties for this kind of perturbations must be checked separately.
Does this mean that axisymmetric problems must be solved as three-dimensional
or some automatic algorithm can be constructed allowing one to introduce rota-
tional discontinuities in the framework of the two-dimensional statement of the
problem? The answer to this question is still open. One should also admit that
the destruction time of the latter kind of nonevolutionary waves can be rather
long. Although it is clear that shocks unstable to tangential perturbations can be
stable in dissipative MHD, their behavior in the case of uncontrollable numerical
dissipation is hardly predictable.

In the context of this section we would like to indicate a very simple numerical
algorithm which was proposed by N. Pogorelov in [6]. In this approach instead of
Eq. (2) we use the formula

where ˆRi+1/2 is the diagonal matrix with the same elements on its diagonal equal
to the spectral radius r (the maximum of eigenvalue magnitudes) of the Jacobian
matrix ∂ ¯E
∂U .

This scheme can be treated as a second-order nonoscillatory extension of
the Lax–Friedrichs method. It is extremely robust and automatically satisﬁes the
entropy condition, thus allowing one to avoid the application of artiﬁcial entropy
ﬁx procedures. Several complicated axisymmetric and three-dimensional physical
problems (see [21] and [22]) were successfully solved using this scheme.

3. The solution selection problem

We shall describe here several physical problems for which the Riemann problem
has nonunique solutions. This nonuniqueness is merely caused by the formulation
of the problem, since in the classical physics the future can be predicted uniquely
by initial conditions. The oversimpliﬁcation is connected with the following two
circumstances.

Alongside with the hyperbolic system of equations presupposing the presence
of discontinuities in its solutions, there exist as a rule a more complete system
which takes into account such processes as viscosity, heat conduction, diﬀusion,
ﬁnite electric conductivity, etc. This system transforms into the hyperbolic one
for large-scale phenomena if certain small terms are neglected. The complete sys-
tem usually has only continuous solutions which can be supposed unique. The
mentioned system, however, has no self-similar solutions depending only on x/t.

Numerical Solution of Hyperbolic Systems

7

Self-similar solutions of this kind can originate as the asymptotics of solutions of
appropriate problems for the complete system for t
. Let us consider as well-
selected the self-similar solution which is the asymptotics of some deﬁnite problem
for the complete system. The suggested selection principle clearly depends on the
physical processes which are not taken into account in the simpliﬁed hyperbolic
system. In the theoretical study it also depends on the selection of the complete
system itself.

→ ∞

Note that not only solutions corresponding to discontinuous initial conditions
but also solutions with arbitrarily (and not necessarily monotonically) smeared
discontinuities in initial conditions have the same asymptotics x/t. The particu-
lar speciﬁcation of this smearing can aﬀect the establishment of one or another
asymptotics. This is the second circumstance which inﬂuence the correct choice of
the self-similar solution.

The ﬁrst step in the application of the complete system of equations is usually
represented by selection among all discontinuities satisfying the conservation laws
those “admissible” discontinuities which have a corresponding solution of the dis-
continuity structure problem described by the complete system. As a discontinuity
structure, we imply the solution which represents a continuous variation of values
corresponding to the jump, this solution being usually considered one-dimensional
and stationary. Note that the latter limitations are not always satisﬁed for real-
istic discontinuities. The requirement of existence of this structure provides the
entropy nondecrease condition and, if the conservation laws are not suﬃcient for
the discontinuity to be evolutionary, is used to obtain new additional boundary
conditions whose satisfaction can make the discontinuity evolutionary. The latter
statement was proved for the case of the stationary one-dimensional structure [13]
and also for the case of periodicity with respect to time and space variables along
the front (cell structure) [14].

In a number of cases the requirement of admissibility of all discontinuities
turns out to be suﬃcient for the solution uniqueness. As an example we can men-
tion the problem of motion of the gas with a complicated equation of state [2]
where viscosity and heat conductivity are taken into account in the discontinuity
structure. On the other hand, there exist problems for which the requirement of
admissibility is insuﬃcient for the uniqueness of the self-similar solution. One of
the well-known examples is the decay of an arbitrary jump in a combustible gas
mixture. There exist mixtures for which both detonation and slow combustion are
possible depending on the ignition method, that is, on the smearing method of the
initial discontinuity (for the detonation to be realized we need a nonmonotonic
smearing with the energy excess). Thus, we encounter a physical unremovable
nonuniqueness of the Riemann problem solution. New problems with a similar
nonremovable nonuniqueness have lately been discovered.

1. The theory of elasticity with viscosity taken into account in the study
of small-scale phenomena. Nonuniqueness of self-similar problems was found in
the investigation of nonlinear quasi-transverse small-amplitude waves in a weakly

8

Kulikovskii, Pogorelov, and Semenov

anisotropic elastic media [17] , which occurs in the general case of one uses only ad-
missible discontinuities. Numerical experiments [8], [17] with viscosity taken into
account showed that, depending on the details of the problem statement which
are not taken into account in the simpliﬁed (hyperbolic) model, all available self-
similar solutions can be realized as an asymptotics of the solution for t
.
→ ∞
However, under monotonic smearing of the initial conditions the solution always
follows the asymptotics of certain deﬁnite type.

2. Nonlinear electromagnetic waves in magnetics [10]. In this case the equa-
tions and the jump relations do not diﬀer in the large-scale approximation from
those describing quasi-transverse elastic waves. However, the structure of electro-
magnetic shock waves is connected with completely diﬀerent mechanisms which
create the dispersion of short waves. The variety of admissible discontinuities turns
out for this reason completely diﬀerent from the corresponding variety in the theory
of elasticity. In particular, a set of separate points corresponding to discontinuities
with one additional condition lie on the shock adiabatic curve. The number of
these points is determined by the ratio between the dispersion and viscosity ef-
fects inside the structure and can be as large as several tens for real magnetics,
thus leading to the multiple nonremovable nonuniqueness of self-similar problems.
3. As shown in [11], the problem on the longitudinal wave propagation through
the rod has properties similar to those described in the previous example if the
derivative of the rod tension with respect to its stress in nonmonotone and has at
least two extremums (a minimum and a maximum). Earlier in [15] a mathematical
example with exactly the same jump behavior was considered. It was based on the
ﬁrst order equation taking into account the dispersion and dissipation under wave
propagation . The shock behavior and connected with this multiple nonuniqueness
of the solutions of the self-similar problems was shown in [11] to be quite usual if
the shock structure is determined by the equations with dispersion which causes
the oscillation of the parameters of the medium inside the discontinuity structure.

4. Self-similar solutions can frequently be nonunique or even nonexistent if
one of the discontinuities is represented by a phase transition front. We shall men-
tion here only the problems dealing with ionization and recombination fronts. A
systematic survey of this subject can be found in [3]. We brieﬂy discuss only so-
lutions describing the motion of a gas in a magnetic ﬁeld where the fronts exist
of the gas electrical conductivity switch-on [4]. The investigation showed that the
self-similar problem can have one self-similar solution, or several ones, or none of
them, depending on the choice of parameters . Numerical experiments [5] under-
taken in the assumption that the only dissipative mechanism is represented by the
ﬁnite gas conductivity showed that if self-similar solutions exist then the numeri-
cal solution asymptotically approaches one of them as t increases. If a self-similar
solution does not exist, alternating layers of conductive and nonconductive gas
originate in calculations and the number of these layers increases in time.

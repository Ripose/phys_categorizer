Abstract. We discuss certain special cases of algebraic approximants that are given
as zeroes of so-called eﬀective characteristic polynomials and their generalization to
a multiseries setting. These approximants are useful for the convergence acceleration
or summation of quantum mechanical perturbation series. Examples will be given
and some properties will be discussed.

1. Introduction

In quantum mechanics, the usual Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger Perturbation
Theory (RSPT) is used for solving the eigenvalue problem of a Hamil-
ton operator

H = H0 + βV

in terms of an unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 with known spectrum, a
perturbation V and a coupling constant β > 0. The RSPT yields for
the I-th eigenvalue a formal power series

with real coeﬃcients E(I)
for the quartic anharmonic oscillator (AHO) with Hamiltonian

n . Such series are often divergent, for instance

amount of literature since the quartic AHO may be considered as

the prototype of a zero-dimensional Φ4 ﬁeld theory, and thus, it has
been used as test case for almost every important numerical method
to solve the quantum mechanical eigenvalue problem. A recent ex-
ample is the use of the generalized Bloch equation as an iterative
method for the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation [18, 19, 20]. For
the quartic AHO, the n-th term an in the RSPT series behaves as
24/π3(−3β/2)nΓ(n + 1/2) for large n [3, 4, 5] and the series
an ∼ −
has zero radius of convergence in the variable β. Thus, one has to sum
such alternating divergent series.

There are many summation methods that can be used in principle,
a review of which is outside the scope of the present article. Consider
a (formal) power series

with partial sums

An important class of summation methods are nonlinear sequence trans-
formations that transform the sequence {sn}∞
n=0 of partial sums to
n}∞
a new transformed sequence {s′
n=0 that is assumed to converge to
the so-called antilimit of the divergent sequence {sn}. This antilimit is
taken as the result of the summation process.

We mention some examples of nonlinear sequence transformations.
One is the famous epsilon algorithm [31] It computes the upper half of
the Pad´e table for the power series f (β) according to [23, 31]

ǫ(n)
2k = [ n + k / k ] ,

(k ≥ 0 , n ≥ 0) .

(6)

Additionally, the epsilon algorithm is related to the Shanks transforma-
tion [23]. Unfortunately, the epsilon algorithm is unable to sum several
important perturbation series, for instance the RSPT series for the
ground state of the octic anharmonic oscillator [29].

As a second nonlinear sequence transformation, we mention the S
transformation of Weniger [28, Sec. 8] that may be deﬁned by the
recursive scheme

(8)

The S transformation depends on an auxiliary sequence {ωn}∞
n=0 of
remainder estimates with ωn 6= 0. Several variants for the choice of the
latter may be considered [16, 13, 7]. For the choice ωn = sn+1 − sn,
originally proposed by Smith and Ford [26], one obtains the ˜t variant
(or d variant in the notation of Weniger [28]) , i.e.,

˜tS (k)

n (ζ, {sn}) = S (k)

n (ζ, {sn}, {sn+1 − sn}) .

(9)

Eq. (7) is essentially one of the recursive schemes for the computation
of the J transformation which is a rather general and well-studied
sequence transformation that covers many of the most successful trans-
formations as special cases [8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 7]. The particular choice
(8) corresponds to the fact that the S transformation is identical to a
special case of the J transformation, namely the case p = 3 of the pJ
transformation [9, 11, 7].

Numerical comparison of results of the summation of the RSPT
series for the ground state of the quartic AHO using the epsilon al-
gorithm and the ˜t-variant of the S transformation shows that the S
transformation is more powerful than the epsilon algorithm for the
summation of this particular perturbation series that is rather strongly
divergent. [29]

An important additional consideration stems from regarding the per-
turbation series as function for complex β, i.e., one considers an analytic
continuation of the formal power series to a function in the complex
plane. Then, in principle, one has to allow for several branches of such
a function. This question was studied intensively for the quartic AHO
by Bender and Wu [3, 4, 5] and Simon [24, 25]. E(β) has a third-order
branch point at β = 0 that dominates the behavior for large β, i.e.,
E(β) = O(β1/3) for β → ∞. In the case of AHOs, often renormalized
series are used that correspond — up to a factor — to a reexpansion
of the original series in a transformed variable κ. The relation between
κ and β for the quartic AHO may be obtained using Symanzik scaling
x → (1 − κ)1/4x plus a certain minimization criterion to be [27, 30]

Thus, E(β) is a multiple-valued function for complex β [24, 25]. This
type of analytic structure is not easy to simulate using rational approx-
imants in β that result on applying either the epsilon algorithm or the
S transformation (or other Levin-type sequence transformations [7]) to
the RSPT series in β of E(1, β). Such a behavior of E(1, β) can much
easier be approximated by algebraic functions in β instead of rational
functions. These algebraic functions are nothing but zeroes of polyno-
mials with coeﬃcients that depend on β. For AHOs, this seemingly ﬁrst
was recognized by Cizek and coworkers who considered polynomials of
a special structure, the so-called eﬀective characteristic polynomials
and applied these to sum the divergent AHO RSPT series [6]. Eﬀective
characteristic polynomials have also been applied successfully for the
extrapolation of quantum chemical many-body perturbation series [12]
and been proven to be size-extensive, i.e., to scale correctly with the
particle number [14] in this context. Later, Sergeev and Goodson [21]
used more general polynomials that give rise to algebraic approximants
[2, Sec. 8.6] for the summation of the ground state of AHOs. Algebraic
approximants are generalizations of the quadratic approximants intro-
duced by Shafer [22]. These types of algebraic approximations will be
discussed more thoroughly in later sections.

All the methods mentioned above and most other methods for the
summation of divergent perturbation series only use the partial sums
or the coeﬃcients of a single series, i.e., the RSPT series of one eigen-
value for a particular value of the coupling constant β. The rest of the
methods may be classiﬁed as multipoint or multiseries methods.

Multipoint methods are those where still a single eigenvalue E(I)(β)
is approximated but several Taylor expansions at diﬀerent points βi
are combined to construct the approximation. The most prominent
example for such methods are multipoint Pad´e approximants [2]. It
should be noted that the large-coupling regime β → ∞ corresponds
to κ → 1 in the renormalized treatment and can be included in a
multipoint treatment. For instance, Cizek and coworkers used two-point
Pad´e approximants for this purpose [6]. For details of such an approach,
the reader is referred to the literature, e.g. Refs. [6, 32].

Extrapolation of Perturbation Series

5

In the present work, we consider multiseries methods. These are dif-
ferent from multipoint methods since the aim is to approximate several
functions depending on β simultaneously using their Taylor series at a
common point, e.g., β = 0. This multiseries problem occurs naturally in
quantum mechanical eigenvalue problems since the Hamilton operator
normally possesses several discrete eigenvalues. Using the same splitting
of the Hamiltonian in unperturbed operator and perturbation involving
the same coupling constant β for all these eigenvalues considered as
functions of β, it is clear that the RSPT series of the form (2) for
several values of I are not independent. In the context of rational
approximation, this multiseries problem leads to simultaneous Pad´e
approximants [2, Sec. 8.1] or vector Pad´e approximants [2, Sec. 8.4].
On the other hand, combining the idea of a multiseries method and the
approximation by algebraic functions, it is rather natural to construct
a polynomial with coeﬃcients that depend on β by using the coeﬃ-
cients of several perturbation series simultaneously [13]. The resulting
algebraic approximations are called polynomial-type multiseries approx-
imants and are the main topic of the present article. These are related
to, but diﬀerent from Hermite-Pad´e approximants as is explained later.
The possible combination of the multipoint and the multiseries con-
cepts leading to the construction of multipoint multiseries approxi-
mants is not considered in the present work.

The outline of the article is as follows. First, we will discuss the
relation between eﬀective characteristic polynomials and algebraic ap-
proximants. Then, multiseries approximants are introduced and several
special types of these approximants are deﬁned. Some properties of
multiseries approximants are derived. In the last section, numerical test
results for the case of the unrenormalized quartic AHO are presented.

2. Eﬀective Characteristic Polynomials

In this section, we sketch eﬀective characteristic polynomials and some
of their properties that are known in the literature, and point out
that they are special cases of algebraic approximants. Also, the aim
is to motivate the extension to a multiseries setting discussed in later
sections.

Consider a polynomial of degree N in E with coeﬃcients that are

polynomials in β of the form

PN (E) =

fN,j,kβk ,

fN,N,0 = 1 .

H. H. H. Homeier

Such a polynomial depends on (N + 3)N/2 coeﬃcients fN,j,k and is
called an eﬀective characteristic polynomial [6, 12, 14]. The reason for
the nomenclature is that characteristic polynomials of this form arise in
the linear variational method in an orthonormal basis φj, j = 1, . . . , N
for Hamiltonians H = H0 + βV , and usually, the f ’s are computed
via matrix elements of H in this basis. For eﬀective characteristic
polynomials, however, the f ’s are obtained from a perturbation series

E(β) =

Ejβj

∞

X
j=0

(12)

(13)

by requiring that

PN (E(β)) = O(βN (N +3)/2)

holds for β → 0. This leads to a system of linear equations for the f ’s
with as many equations as there are unknowns. If this system possesses
a solution, the f ’s and thus, the eﬀective characteristic polynomials are
uniquely deﬁned. For known f ’s, the eigenvalues are approximated by
zeroes of PN that are denoted by ΠN,j, j = 1, . . . , N and are called
eﬀective characteric polynomial approximants. The branch that repro-
duces the input data is simply denoted by ΠN and called the physical
branch. In order to discuss the dependence of the approximants on the
coeﬃcients Ej of the series (12), the explicit notation ΠN,j[E0, . . . , EM ]
is used where M = N (N + 3)/2 − 1.

It should be noted that the physical branch can become complex.
Then, for N = 2 both branches yield complex results, for instance.
This, of course, is not reasonable for the computation of discrete eigen-
values of the Hamiltonian that is a self-adjoint operator, and indicates
a breakdown of the perturbative approach. Complex values of the
approximants, however, make sense for the description of resonances
or tunneling processes [1, Chap. 8],[17], and thus, there are problems
where the possibility of obtaining complex approximations from real
perturbation series is a desired feature.

We now discuss some properties of these approximants. Note that
equivalence and invariance properties of algebraic approximants are
known from the literature [2, Sec. 8.6] and this is relevant since the
latter approximants are generalizations of eﬀective characteristic poly-
nomial approximants as discussed below.

As shown independently in the literature [12, 14] before the connec-
tion to algebraic approximants was recognized, the eﬀective character-
istic polynomial approximant Π2 is invariant under a repartioning of
the Hamiltonian where H0 is replaced by the new unperturbed oper-
ator (1 − α)H0 and α is some constant. Denoting the corresponding

proceed_a.tex; 2/02/2008; 2:47; p.6

Extrapolation of Perturbation Series

7

coeﬃcients of the RSPT eigenvalue series by Ej(α), one has

Π2[E0, . . . , E4] = Π2[E0(α), . . . , E4(α)] .

(14)

This means that the approximant is invariant under the repartioning as
the true eigenvalue has to be. In Ref. [14] it is shown that a particular
eﬀective characteristic polynomial approximant ΠN,j for some N and
j with 1 ≤ j ≤ N has the scaling property

ΠN,j[c E0, . . . , c EM ] = c ΠN,j[E0, . . . , EM ] .

(15)

This is important to guarantee size-extensitivity, i.e., correct scaling
with particle number in many-body perturbation theory [14].

We now show that eﬀective characteristic polynomial approximants
are special algebraic approximants. These are generalizations of Pad´e
approximants. Algebraic approximants are constructed via polynomials
A(k) in β with deg(A(k)) = dk, k = 0, . . . , N such that for Q = −1 +
N

k=0 dk and for a given power series E(β) as deﬁned in Eq. (12)

the relations

PN (E(β)) =

A(k)(β)[E(β)]k = O(βQ+1)

(16)

N

X
k=0

are satisﬁed for β → 0. Since this deﬁnes the polynomials only up
to a common factor, we additionally demand A(N )(0) = 1 as a nor-
malization. For given polynomials A(k), the algebraic approximants
E[d0,d1,...,dN ],j are deﬁned as the zeroes of the polynomial PN according
to

PN (cid:16)E[d0,d1,...,dN ],j(cid:17) = 0 ,

(j = 1, . . . , N ) ,

(17)

and depend on Q + 1 coeﬃcients E0, . . . , EQ that play the role of the
input data. Again, one may deﬁne the physical branch as that one
which reproduces the input data via a Taylor expansion in β.

Comparison with the deﬁnition of eﬀective characteristic polyno-
mial approximants reveals that the latter are nothing but the special
algebraic approximants

ΠN,j = E[N,N −1,N −2,...,0],j ,

(j = 1, . . . , N ) .

(18)

It should be noted that algebraic approximants

− are special cases of Hermite-Pad´e approximants and are described

by a quite elaborate mathematical theory [2, Sec. 8.5, 8.6]

− are useful for multi-valued functions (analytic continuation to an-

other Riemann sheet)

noted in the introduction.

3. Polynomial-type Multiseries Approximants

In this section, we deﬁne the polynomial-type multiseries approximants,
and introduce three special cases (Π-, D-, and P-type approximants).
The relation to Hermite-Pad´e approximants is pointed out. An ex-
ample is given for Π-type approximants. Further, it is proved that
the polynomial coeﬃcients of P-type approximants can be computed
recursively.

As indicated in the introduction, the key idea of the present work is
to use coeﬃcients of several perturbation series for diﬀerent eigenvalues
to compute the algebraic approximants.

For the deﬁnition of polynomial-type multiseries approximants1, we

consider a polynomial

PN (z) =

A(k)(β)zk

(19)

N

X
k=0

where the coeﬃcients A(k) are polynomials in β with deg(A(k)) = dk ≥
0 for k = 1, . . . , N . They satisfy for β → 0 the order conditions

PN (E(I)(β)) = O(βQI +1) ,

(I = 1, . . . , S)

(20)

for S given series E(I)(β) of the form (2) and S parameters QI restricted
by demanding

S

X
I=1

N

X
k=0

(QI + 1) = N +

dk .

(21)

The normalization condition is A(N )(0) = 1. The latter and the order
conditions (20) again lead to a system of linear equations for the coef-
ﬁcients of the polynomials A(k) with as many unknowns as equations
if (21) is satisﬁed. Hence the polynomials A(k) are uniquely deﬁned if
the linear system possesses a solution as is assumed in the following.

Given the polynomials A(k), the multiseries approximants
[d0,d1,...,dN ],j are deﬁned as the zeroes of PN , i.e.,

E[Q1,...,QS]

PN (cid:16)E[Q1,...,QS]
1 These are called simply multiseries approximants in the following.

[d0,d1,...,dN ],j(cid:17) = 0 .

(22)

These approximants depend on β and the coeﬃcients

I = 1, . . . , S .

(23)

We are especially interested in the case that S = N which means
that as many perturbation series are used as there are roots of PN ,
i.e., as there are approximants. In this case, the consistency condition
becomes

N

X
I=1

QI =

dk .

N

X

(24)

Therefore, we deﬁne the following special cases:

Π-type approximants with S = N

Π[N ],j = E[N,N −1,N −2,...,1]

[N,N −1,N −2,...,1,0],j ,

(j = 1, . . . , N ) .

(25)

Here, Eq. (24) is obviously satisﬁed.

D-type approximants with S = N for even N = 2D

D[N ],j = E[N,N −1,N −2,...,1]

[D,...,D],j

,

(j = 1, . . . , N ) .

(26)

Here, Eq. (24) is satisﬁed: The left hand side is N (N + 1)/2, the
right hand side is D(N + 1), and both agree since N = 2D.

P -type approximants with S = N

P[Q],j = E[Q,Q,...,Q]

[Q,Q,...,Q,0],j ,

(j = 1, . . . , N ) .

(27)

Here again, Eq. (24) is obviously satisﬁed.

Π-type approximants were introduced by the author [13], D- and P-type
approximants are new.

We note that these multiseries approximants

− are related to, but diﬀerent from Hermite-Pad´e approximants [2,
Sec. 8.5], To be more speciﬁc, we remark that the order conditions
(20) are diﬀerent from those satisﬁed by the Hermite-Pad´e poly-
nomials aI,mI (β) that are contructed from the same S power series
E(I)(β), I = 1, . . . , S via, e.g.,

− are useful for multi-valued functions (analytic continuation to an-

other Riemann sheet),

− have no convergence theory so far, and

− are possibly cheaper than algebraic approximants since the nu-
merical eﬀort to compute several short perturbation expansions is
much less than one long expansion.

As a simple example, we consider the harmonic oscillator problem

with Hamiltonian

H = −

d2
dx2 + (1 + β)x2 , H0 = H − βx2

with eigenvalues

E(I) = (2I − 1)

1 + β .

The coeﬃcients of the perturbation series follow by Taylor expansion
of the E(I):

Here, we have underlined the terms that are correct in comparison with
the exact results. Thus, we gain one order for E(1) in comparison to
the input data while there is no gain in E(2).

The following theorem shows that the coeﬃcients in P -type polyno-
mials leading to approximants P[Q+1] satisfy the equations for the poly-
nomials leading to approximants P[Q], and hence, these polynomials can
be computed recursively.

Recursive algorithms are also known for certain algebraic approxi-
mants [21], and, more generally for the computation of Hermite-Pad´e
polynomials [2, Sec. 8.5].

4. Numerical Tests

In the test cases, we always treat the quartic AHO with Hamiltonian
as deﬁned in Eq. (3) for small β without any renormalization. The
coeﬃcients in all the perturbation series used below have been com-
puted using RSPT up to order 20 in the wave functions, followed by
Taylor expansion of the Rayleigh-Ritz expectation value with this wave
function leading to the coeﬃcients in the perturbation series for the
energies up to order 41. The computations were done in MAPLE VTM.
In Table I, we consider quadratic P-type approximants (N = S = 2)
for various values of Q. The calculation of approximants P[Q],j requires
two Q-th order perturbation series for the two lowest eigenvalues. The
results show that both eigenvalues are well approximated for Q = 15.

The convergence of the approximants is somewhat faster for the lower
eigenvalue.

In Table II, we consider Π-type approximants for various values of N .
The calculation of approximants Π[N ],j requires N perturbation series
with orders N, N − 1, . . . , 1.
Only the results for the two lowest eigenvalues are displayed for com-
parison reasons. The data show that Π-type approximants converge
somewhat faster than P -type approximants in the example treated. The
results show that both eigenvalues are well approximated for N = 10.
The convergence of the approximants is somewhat faster for the lower

For large β, both Π- and P -type approximants break down and start

to produce complex approximants.

In Table III, we consider D-type approximants for various values of
N for a larger β. The calculation of approximants D[N ],j requires N
perturbation series with orders N, N − 1, . . . , 1 (even N ). Again, only
the results for the two lowest eigenvalues are displayed for comparison
reasons. The results indicate that this type of multiseries approximant
can be useful for somewhat larger β. Comparison values are taken from
Ref. [18].

In further studies it is planned to study these approximants also for
renormalized perturbation series in order to see whether for these the
range of applicability of the approximants is extended as is the case for
several other methods.

5. Summary

− Eﬀective characteristic polynomial approximants are special alge-

braic approximants.

− Polynomial-type multiseries approximants combine the informa-
tion of several perturbation series and allow the summation of
divergent series. They are diﬀerent from Hermite-Pad´e approxi-
mants.

− Perturbation series for these multiseries approximants are less costly
to calculate than for algebraic approximants (several short series
vs. one long expansion).

− The simultaneous calculation of several eigenvalues is possible.

Higher eigenvalues converge slower.

− The large number of variants of multiseries approximants should

be explored further.

Abstract

A discontinuous Galerkin method has been developed for strain gradient-
dependent damage. The strength of this method lies in the fact that it allows
the use of C0 interpolation functions for continuum theories involving higher-
order derivatives, while in a conventional framework at least C1 interpolations
are required. The discontinuous Galerkin formulation thereby oﬀers signiﬁcant
potential for engineering computations with strain gradient-dependent models.
When using basis functions with a low degree of continuity, jump conditions
arise at element edges which are incorporated in the weak form.
In addition
to the formulation itself, a detailed study of the convergence properties of the
method for various element types is presented, an error analysis is undertaken,
and the method is also shown to work in two dimensions.

1 Introduction

The nucleation and growth of cracks can be described by continuum damage
mechanics. In this approach, an internal variable is included in the constitutive
law to represent the evolution of microstructural damage (Kachanov, 1958).
The material moduli degrade with the increase of this parameter, which could
be either scalar or tensorial in character. A scalar internal variable is commonly
used to model damage degradation for cases in which the material remains
isotropic. A tensorial form of the internal variable is used for the anisotropic
case.

Damage degradation can manifest itself in progressive material softening, for
which reason numerical results based upon classical continuum mechanics are
characterised by a pathological mesh dependence (Willam, 1984; Baˇzant, 1986).
As the material softens, deformations localise within bands of ﬁnite thickness,
which is viewed as the smearing out of a crack (Rashid, 1968; Baˇzant and Oh,
1983). However, the width of bands is intimately related to the element size.
As the mesh is reﬁned the band width decreases, tending to zero in the limit.
The result of this is seen in load-displacement response with slopes that are
increasingly negative with mesh reﬁnement in the softening regime. The origin
of this pathology lies in the loss of ellipticity of the material tangent modulus
tensor for softening inelastic continuum models in the absence of rate eﬀects
(Rice, 1976).

The last two decades have witnessed a great deal of work in ‘regularised’ con-
tinuum models to avoid the loss of ellipticity in the presence of material soften-
ing. Among these are the strain gradient models (Aifantis, 1984; Coleman and Hodgdon,
1985; Triantafyllidis and Aifantis, 1986; Peerlings et al., 1996), nonlocal models
(Baˇzant and Pijaudier-Cabot, 1988; de Vree et al., 1995; Borino et al., 2003),
localisation limiters (Lasry and Belytchko, 1998), and Cosserat models (de Borst and Sluys,
1991), to identify but a fraction of a vast body of literature.

By various techniques, each of these models introduces an intrinsic length
scale to the continuum theory. When the material softens, the localisation band
width is controlled by this length scale, rather than the element size. As a
result, the mesh size-dependency, described above, is eliminated.

In this paper we aim to address numerical issues associated with some strain
gradient models. This class of models involves strains and strain gradients as
kinematic terms. In some models work conjugate couple stresses are also iden-
tiﬁed. Dimensional considerations lead to the introduction of intrinsic length
scales associated with the strain gradients. The presence of strain gradient
terms alters the mathematical character of the governing diﬀerential equations,
elevating them to a higher order (at least locally). A numerical complication
arises from the higher order character of the governing diﬀerential equations, as
standard C0 interpolation functions often do not furnish suﬃcient continuity.

The obvious approach, that is to employ interpolation functions with higher-
order continuity (C1 and higher), has not proven fruitful. Finite element meth-
ods with these interpolations are expensive and diﬃcult to construct. There
exists some work with mixed formulations for this purpose (Shu et al., 1999;

2

Zervos et al., 2001). However, the very simplest two-dimensional elements in-
volve up to 28 degrees of freedom, placing them beyond the realm of prac-
ticability. Some authors have applied element-free Galerkin methods, on the
basis of the arbitrary degree of continuity that they can provide (Askes et al.,
2000). However, this class of methods introduces complications in the applica-
tion of boundary conditions and is somewhat less eﬃcient than the ﬁnite element
method, and its implementation involves a reformulation of the dominant ﬁnite
element architecture, making its widespread use less attractive.
In addition,
just as high-order continuity can be diﬃcult to achieve, excessive continuity can
also be a drawback for many models, particularly at internal boundaries where
the order of the governing diﬀerential equation changes.

In this work we seek to expand upon recent developments in discontinu-
ous Galerkin methods for strain gradient-dependent theories (Engel et al., 2002;
Wells et al., 2004). The great advantage of this class of methods is the ability
to use C0 interpolation functions for the displacement when solving continuum
theories involving higher-order derivatives. In cases where other considerations
make it advantageous to also interpolate strain-like quantities, the approach can
allow interpolated ﬁelds that are discontinuous across elements (Wells et al.,
2004).

The content of this paper is organised as follows. The strain gradient damage
model of interest is described in Section 2, with special attention paid to the
boundary conditions. The Galerkin formulation for this model is presented in
Section 3. The convergence behaviour of the model in one dimension is examined
both analytically and numerically in Section 4, and the section is concluded with
one- and two-dimensional examples. Conclusions are then drawn in Section 5.

2 Gradient damage

Consider a body Ω, which is an open subset in Rn, where n is the spatial
dimension. The boundary of the body is denoted by Γ = ∂Ω, and the outward
unit normal to Γ is denoted by n. We consider quasi-static equilibrium of the
body, which is governed by

∇ ·

σ + f = 0
σn = h
u = g

in Ω,
on Γh,
on Γg,

where σ is the stress tensor, f is the body force, h is the prescribed traction
on the boundary Γh and g is the prescribed displacement on the boundary Γg.
The boundary Γ is partitioned such that Γ = Γg
. For
isotropic damage, it is suﬃcient to introduce a single scalar damage variable,
1. Considering that D = 0 implies no damage and D = 1
D, satisfying 0
corresponds to a completely damaged material point, the stress-strain relation
is of the form

where D = D(κ). The scalar strain measure ¯ε of interest here arises from a

In this approach, the strain
measure is deﬁned to be

ε = εeq + c2

2εeq,

∇

where c is an intrinsic length scale, and εeq is a suitably chosen invariant of the
local strain tensor.

For material points at which damage is developing, the governing equation
is nonlinear and fourth-order in the displacement. In undamaged or unloading
regions ( ˙κ = 0), the governing equation is linear and second-order. Recognising
the fourth-order form of the diﬀerential equation (at least in sub-regions of Ω)
leads to the question of appropriate boundary conditions. Possible boundary
conditions (in addition to the usual boundary conditions on the displacement
and traction) include:

indicates the unit outward normal to the boundary of the damaged domain, Γd.
These boundary conditions supplement the standard displacement and traction
boundary conditions on Γ.
If the entire body Ω is damaging, then Γd = Γ.
Commonly however, damage is localised. In this case interface conditions arise
on the boundaries which are internal to Ω (the boundaries to sub-domains where
˙κ > 0 and ˙κ = 0 meet). When the body force is smooth, continuity of u and
σnd are natural continuity conditions. At the interface between damaging and
elastic regions, an additional condition is required on the damage domain. The
need for extra boundary conditions is made particularly clear by the analytical
solution presented in later in Section 4.2.1. In the adopted formulation, this
nd across the damage-
extra condition will come from implied continuity of
elastic boundary.

3 Galerkin formulation

In developing a weak formulation for eventual ﬁnite element solution, the equi-
librium equation (1) and the equation for ε (6) are considered separately. The
nonlinear fourth-order equation resulting from insertion of the constitutive equa-
tions into the equilibrium equation could potentially be cast in a weak form,
with integration by parts applied twice. The formulation would be speciﬁc

to the chosen dependence of damage on κ, which is typically complex. Fur-
thermore, the complexities associated with a moving elastic-damage boundary
(which is the interface between second- and fourth-order sub-domains) would
be signiﬁcant. Hence, it is convenient to treat the two equations separately.

The body Ω is partitioned into nel non-overlapping elements Ωe such that

where Ωe is a closed set (i.e., it includes the boundary of the element). The
elements Ωe (which are open sets) satisfy the standard requirements for a ﬁnite

Recall that discontinuities in qh and εh across
Γ are permitted. At this stage, the
only boundary conditions implied by the formulation are on the displacement
ﬁeld (by construction) and the traction. Discussion regarding the enforcement
of ‘non-standard’ boundary conditions is delayed until the following section.

e

Two problems exist in the preceding Galerkin formulation. The ﬁrst is that
the weight function qh can be discontinuous, hence
qh is not necessarily square-
integrable on Ω. This problem can be circumvented easily by requiring C0 con-
h. The second problem, which is less easily solved,
tinuity of the functions in
is that εh

eq everywhere in
Ω requires that the displacement ﬁeld uh be C1 continuous if singularities are

3.2 Discontinuous Galerkin form

The approach advocated here avoids the need for C1 continuity of the dis-
placement ﬁeld by imposing the required degree of continuity in a weak sense.
Before proceeding with the formulation, jump and averaging operations are de-
ﬁned. The jump in a ﬁeld a across a surface (which is associated with a body)
is given by:

a

K

n1 + a2 ·

where the subscripts denote the side of the surface and n is the outward unit
n2 in the geometrically linear case). The average of a

Equation (20) resembles the ‘interior penalty’ method, which belongs to the
discontinuous Galerkin family of methods (Arnold et al., 2002). Terms have
been added to the weak form that for a conventional elasticity problem would
lead to a symmetric formulation. Symmetry is however not of relevance here as
the functions qh and εh
eq will generally come from diﬀerent function spaces. This

formulation is general for the case in which the space
h are C0 continuous, the
functions. However, note if all functions in the space
formulation is still valid, with terms relating to the jump in εh

formulation would then resemble a continuous/discontinuous Galerkin method
(Engel et al., 2002).

where α2 is a penalty parameter which attempts to impose the boundary con-
n = 0, and E is Young’s modulus. The enforcement of this
dition (
boundary condition is not in the spirit of discontinuous Galerkin methods, as
the resulting Galerkin problem is not consistent, in the same sense that penalty
methods are not consistent (the restoration of consistency would require an ap-
proach analogous to Nitsche’s method). However, this is of no consequence for
the considered problems due to a fortuitous choice of interpolation, as will be
shown later. Preserving consistency while imposing the non-standard boundary
condition weakly is complex due to the nonlinear dependency on ε. This is
a topic requiring further investigation. Boundary conditions are not explicitly
Γ as the necessary conditions are implied implicitly in the formu-
applied on Γd
lation, as will be shown in examining consistency of the proposed formulation.
The weak enforcement of the non-standard boundary condition proposed here
has not been tested numerically.

The nonlinear equations in (21) and (22) are coupled through the dependence
of D on εh and the dependency of εh on uh. Linearisation of these equations is
discussed in Wells et al. (2004).

3.3 Consistency of the discontinuous formulation

Having added non-standard terms to the weak form, it is important to prove
consistency of the method. Applying integration by parts to the integral over

element boundaries. The Galerkin form (equation (20)) can therefore be seen
as the weak imposition of these Euler-Lagrange equations.

4 Analysis and examples

The formulation outlined in Section 3 has been analysed, and tested for various
problems. Elements are diﬀerentiated on the basis of the interpolation order
for uh (which is always C0 continuous), the interpolation order for εh, and the
continuity of εh. For example, an element with cubic shape functions for uh
and C0 continuous, quadratic shape functions for εh is denoted P 3/P 2(C0). An
element with quadratic shape functions for uh and discontinuous, linear shape
functions for εh is denoted P 2/P 1(C−1).

For one-dimensional examples, εeq = ε.

4.1 Convergence for the elastic case in one dimension

For an elastic problem, there exists a one-way coupling between the two weak
equations (21) and (22). In this section, the approximation of ε, for given a
solution to equation (21), is examined. For an elastic bar, the fundamental
problem is a second-order diﬀerential equation, and the second weak equation
provides a projection of the solution to the equilibrium equation (and its relevant
derivatives) onto the basis for ε.

Here, an analysis for the L2-error in εh,

, where ε is the exact

In order to compare with numerical solutions, we
have solved an elastic problem with a forcing function chosen such that ε has
a localised character to it. The analysis rests upon the crucial result that the
one-dimensional ﬁnite element displacement ﬁeld, uh, is nodally-exact when the
shape functions are derived from Lagrange polynomials (Strang and Fix, 1973).
Consider the interpolation combinations P k+1/P k(C0) and P k+1/P k(C−1).
Let the nodal values of εh corresponding to element e be denoted by δk(e−1)+1,
. . . , δke+1 for the C0 case, and by δ(k+1)(e−1)+1, . . . , δ(k+1)e for the C−1 case.
The values of uh at the nodes corresponding to this element are d(k+1)(e−1)+1,
. . . , d(k+1)e+1. The nodal displacements coincide with the exact solution. The
discrete matrix form of equation (22) reveals the stencil relating the δ- and d-
values. In the C0 case,

4.1.2 Observed convergence rates

The convergence rate estimates from the previous section are now compared with
observed rates. To do this, the convergence of ε is examined for the quadratically
tapering bar shown in Figure 3. Considering that the origin is located as the
centre of the bar, the cross section A is given by

A(x) = A1 + γ2A1

x2
L2 ,

where γ controls the ratio between A1 and A2 (γ2 = (A2 −
A1) /A1). This
problem can be equivalently formulated as a rod with unit cross-section and
loading f which varies along the rod, which allows the convergence analysis
from the previous section to be carried over for this case. The exact solution
for ε along the bar is:

and the exact solution of ε,xx is:

ε =

ε,xx =

(cid:0)

.

(cid:1)

The term εh involves both ε and ε,xx. The ε component involves the standard
L2 projection of εh (coming from the solution of the equilibrium equation) onto
the basis for εh. This projection does not involve any of the element interface
terms that have arisen in the discontinuous Galerkin formulation. Of special
interest is the approximation of the ε,xx term. To examine numerically the
convergence of this term, the weak form corresponding to:

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

is solved, as it is the ε,xx term that dominates the convergence rate. However,
in practice, the convergence rate of ε may appear to dominate due to a large
diﬀerence in the constants in the error inequality. Taking equation (22) and

For the parameters A1 = 1 mm2, A2 = 0.1 mm2, L = 50 mm, E = 1 MPa
and P = 1 N, the convergence behaviour is examined for a range of elements. To
gain insight, the form of the exact solution is shown in Figure 4. The L2-norm of
the computed error for a range elements is shown in Figure 5 for the case α = 1.
If the error is computed by integrating over the entire bar (
50 < x < 50),
as in Figure 5, the results are polluted by errors at the boundaries of the bar.
In Figure 5, the convergence behaviour represents primarily how rapidly the
computed solution approaches the exact solution at the boundaries. However,
when simulating a tapered damaging bar, the error at the boundaries of the
bar is of little consequence as damage develops at the centre, and ε at the
boundaries plays no role (presuming that the deviation from the exact solution
is not suﬃcient to induce spurious damage development). Excluding the error
at the end of the bar by integrating over
40 < x < 40, the convergence
behaviour is more predictable, as can be seen in Figure 6. From Figure 6, it
can be concluded that the convergence rate for all elements is consistent with
the predicted rates (as summarised in Table 1).

4.2 Convergence for the inelastic case in one dimension

The formulation is now examined for the inelastic case. Again, the quadratically
tapering bar is considered, which leads to damage development at the centre of
the bar. For a particular relationship between D and κ, it is possible to solve
the problem analytically, which provides the basis for numerical convergence
tests.

4.2.1 Analytical solution

Consider again the bar shown in Figure 3, where the shaded region indicates
the damaged zone and x =
w is the location of the damage–elastic boundary.
For convenience, the force P is expressed as

±

where β governs the magnitude of the applied load and κ0 is the value of κ at
which damage is ﬁrst induced. In the undamaged part of the bar, the strain
response is given by

4.2.2 Damage convergence results

The convergence behaviour of various elements for the outlined test problem
is now examined. For the tests, the following parameters are adopted: γ = 3,
103 MPa, c = 1 mm and A1 = 1 mm2
β = 5/29, L = 100 mm, E = 200

computed numerically.

The results of the error analysis, for various elements, are shown in Figure 9.
For the P 1/P 0
elements, α = 1, α = 4
and α = 6, respectively. These choices draw upon the observed convergence
results for the elastic case. For all the elements, the solution converges. Once a

level of reﬁnement has been reached, the convergence rate is linear. Moreover,
for a given interpolation order, continuous and discontinuous interpolations yield
similar results.

4.2.3 Non-trivial damage response

The quadratically tapering bar is now examined for a non-trivial softening rela-
tionship. For the tapered bar the relevant parameters are: γ = 3, A1 = 1 mm2,
10−4, κc = 0.0125, and c = 1 mm.

which leads to a linear softening relationship for c = 0. The numerical per-
formance of the formulation has previously been demonstrated in Wells et al.
(2004) for continuous, piecewise linear uh and constant εh, discontinuous across
element boundaries (the P 1/P 0(C−1) element). The formulation was shown
numerically to converge to a benchmark solution. Here, the formulation is ex-
tended for a range of diﬀerent element types.

The motivation behind the considered strain gradient-dependent model is
regularisation in the presence of strain softening. Without strain gradient eﬀects
(c = 0), computed results are pathologically mesh-dependent; the result of which
is manifest in the load–displacement responses. Therefore, each of the elements
which to this point have been examined are tested, and the load-displacement
responses reported for meshes with 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 elements. For the
P 3/P 2(C−1) element, the numerical tests are performed with meshes of 20, 40,
80 and 160 elements. To provide a reference solution, the response computed
using 160 P 3/P 2
elements is included in all ﬁgures.

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

The load-displacement responses for the two elements using a continuous in-
terpolation of εh are shown in Figure 10. As the mesh is reﬁned, the computed
response for both element types converges towards to the reference solution.
The load-displacement responses for three elements using a discontinuous inter-
polation of εh are shown in Figure 11. Again, for the P 1/P 0
element,
α = 1, for the P 2/P 1
element, α = 4, and for the P 3/P 2
element,
α = 6. It is clear, for all elements, that the load–displacement response con-
verges to the reference solution with mesh reﬁnement. To further examine the
computed results, the damage proﬁles for the two continuous elements and the
three discontinuous elements are compared in Figures 12 and 13, respectively.
For all cases, the 160 element mesh is considered. Clearly, the damage proﬁles
are nearly identical for all element types.

4.3 Three-point bending test

(cid:0)

C0

To conclude the numerical validations, a three-point bending test is performed
using a P 2/P 1
element. The element is triangular, with degrees of freedom
for uh located at the vertexes and at the mid-sides, and degrees of freedom
for εh located only at the vertexes of the element. The choice of a quadratic
interpolation of uh means that the penalty term for imposing the non-standard
boundary condition in equation (21) vanishes, and the non-standard boundary
condition is satisﬁed by construction (see equation (21)). The equivalent strain
is taken as the trace of the strain tensor,

(cid:1)

εeq = trace (ε) .

This choice does not reﬂect a strong physical motivation, rather it is chosen for
illustrative purposes as it allows for relatively simple linearisation of the method
(which can become extremely complex when c

= 0).

10−4, and κc = 1.25

The three-point bending test is performed for two diﬀerent meshes with c
= 0
and c = 0. The adopted geometry for the three-point bending test is shown in
Figure 14, and the adopted material parameters are: Young’s modulus E =

when damage reaches unity at any point in the mesh, and damage development
at the supports is prevented. The computed damage contours for the four cases
are shown in Figure 15. From the damage contours, it is clear that the computed
results are similar for the two meshes with c
= 0. In the absence of regularising
eﬀects (c = 0), the result is clearly aﬀected by the discretisation. The load–
displacement responses for the various cases are shown in Figure 16. Recall
that a computation is halted when damage reaches unity at a material point.
For the gradient-dependent case, the responses for the two meshes are similar.
For the case c = 0, the responses are also similar, which is somewhat in contrast
to what is normally expected for a strain softening problem. The responses are
similar in this case due to the spurious development of two cracks for the ﬁner
mesh (in contrast to the single main crack for the coarse mesh). This is evident
from the damage contours in Figure 15.

5 Conclusions

A discontinuous Galerkin formulation for a strain gradient-dependent damage
model has been investigated for a range of diﬀerent ﬁnite elements. The model
allows the numerical solution of a continuum problem which would classically re-
quire C1 interpolations with a simple C0 or even discontinuous basis. Examples
demonstrate robust performance for a range of polynomial orders and degrees
of continuity of the interpolation functions, and are supported by rigorous error
analysis. Speciﬁcally, lower-order interpolations perform well and are relatively
simple to construct. The convergence properties of the proposed method have
been examined for the elastic case, for which the observed rates are consis-
tent with the theoretically predicted rates. The formulation has been observed
numerically to converge also for damage problems. Finally, the formulation
was applied successfully to a two-dimensional problem. While the approach is
promising, several issues remain. Diﬃculties which must be resolved for other
gradient models include the eﬀective imposition of boundary conditions on the
ﬁxed boundary of a body, and at moving boundaries internal to a body. The
development of thermodynamically consistent models would assist in this sense,
as the higher-order kinematic gradients have a natural partner in the energetic
sense.

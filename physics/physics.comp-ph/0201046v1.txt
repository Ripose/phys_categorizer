DRAFT!!)

Systematic inaccuracy is inherent in any computational estimate of a non-linear average, due
to the availability of only a ﬁnite number of data values, N . Free energy diﬀerences ∆F between
two states or systems are critically important examples of such averages in physical, chemical and
biological settings. Previous work has demonstrated, empirically, that the “ﬁnite-sampling error”
can be very large — many times kBT — in ∆F estimates for simple molecular systems. Here, we
present a theoretical description of the inaccuracy, including the exact solution of a sample problem,
the precise asymptotic behavior in terms of 1/N for large N , the identiﬁcation of universal law, and
numerical illustrations. The theory relies on corrections to the central and other limit theorems,
and thus a role is played by stable (L´evy) probability distributions.

Introduction. Free energy diﬀerence calculations have a tremendous range of applications in physical, chemical,
and biological systems; examples include computations relating magnetic phases, estimates of chemical potentials,
and of binding aﬃnities of ligands to proteins (e.g., [1–6]). Since the work of Kirkwood [7], it has been appreciated

FIG. 1. Finite-sampling error for Gaussian-distributed work values. The expected value of the dimensionless ﬁnite-sampling
inaccuracy, (∆Fn − ∆F )/kBT for n data points is plotted as a function of 1/n. From top to bottom, the data sets represent
numerical values of the error for Gaussian distributions of work values with standard deviations, σw/kB T of 3, 2, 1.5, and 1.
The right panel also shows the exact, asymptotic linear behavior for the smallest widths.

Whenever a convex, nonlinear average such as (1) is estimated computationally, that result will always be systemat-
ically biased [10] because one has only a ﬁnite amount of data — say, N work values. The bias results from incomplete
sampling of the smallest (or most negative) W0→1 values: these values dominate the average (1) and cannot be sam-
pled perfectly for ﬁnite N , regardless of the W0→1 distribution. Thus, a running estimate of ∆F will typically decline

More recently, Zuckerman and Woolf [13] suggested a means by which a range of ∆Fn values for n < N could be
used to extrapolate to the true, inﬁnite-data answer, ∆F . The authors also observed that, for large m = N/n, the
free energy is bounded according to

This inequality results from the convexity of the exponential function, as will be demonstrated explicitly in a fuller
account of the theory. Finally, Zuckerman and Woolf noted that the leading behavior of ∆Fn appeared to be not
always linear in 1/n but, rather, seemed to behave as (1/n)τ1 for τ1 ≤
This Letter presents the theory — apparently for the ﬁrst time — describing the ﬁnite-sampling inaccuracy for ∆F
estimates. Previous work discussing ∆Fn has been, primarily, empirical [11,13]. Our report includes (i) the formal
∆F ; (ii) an exact solution, for all N ,

of this expected value when the Boltzmann factor of the work value z
for arbitrary W distribtions, including non-
exact asymptotic expressions for ∆Fn and the variance of
analytic behavior in the case when the variance and higher moments of z diverge; and (iv) discussion and numerical
illustrations based on Gaussian distributions of W , plus corrections expected from skewed Gaussian distributions. The
present discussion makes use of mathematical results regarding the convergence — to “stable” limiting distributions
[14–16], also known as L´evy processes (e.g., [17]) — of the distributions of sums of variables. The results are expected
to have practical application in the extrapolation process outlined in [13].

To continue, we must call upon some mathematical results regarding the approach, with increasing n, to general
stable limit distributions (of which the Gaussian, for α = 2, is the best known [14,16]). More precisely, the sum of
any set of random variables, suitably normalized as in (7), has a distribution with zero mean which may be expressed
as a stable distribution function multiplied by a large-n asymptotic expansion [14,19].

Finite-Moments Case and An Exact Solution. To illustrate the case of a Gaussian limit (α = 2), assume the
variable e−w possesses ﬁnite “Boltzmann moments” — a mean ˆµ = e−f , variance ˆσ2, and third moment ˆµ3 — not to
be confused with the moments of the distribution of w. The ﬁnite-n corrections to the central limit theorem indicate

One arrives at the explicit form of the ﬁnite-data-corrected free energy for the case of ﬁnite ˆσ2 and ˆµ3 by substituting
(9) into (8), along with an expansion of the logarithm about y = 0. (More careful consideration of series convergence
for large y yields the same ﬁnal result for fn, as will be elucidated in future work.) Because of the odd- and even-ness
of the factors to be integrated, one ﬁnds an expansion consisting solely of integer powers of 1/n, namely,

Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of the ﬁnite-data free-energy for a Gaussian distribution of work values, based
f is
on numerical block averages (2) and the asymptotic behavior given in (11). Although the leading term in fn −
linear in 1/n, the leading coeﬃcient is exponential in the square of the distribution’s width, while the next coeﬃcient
depends on the cube of the width. The asymptotic expressions (11) thus represent viable approximations only for a
very small window about 1/n = 0 for large widths. Fig. 1 shows that such behavior is easily mistaken for non-analytic
(e.g., power-law) behavior.

An exactly solvable case occurs when the Boltzmann factor e−w

z is distributed according to a gamma distribu-

tion, namely,

ρΓ(z; b, q) = (z/b)q−1 exp (

z/b) / bΓ(q) .

fn(n; b, q) = log (n/b)

Because this density is “inﬁnitely divisible” (see, e.g., [14]) the required sums in (3) also follow gamma distributions,
and after performing the integration described in (8), one ﬁnds

where the digamma function is deﬁned by ψ(x) = (d/dx)Γ(x). The exact solution is illustrated in Fig. 2 for b = 10,
q = 2.

When asymmetry is added to a Gaussian distribution via the ﬁrst Edgeworth correction (see, e.g., [14]), one ﬁnds
that the exponential dependence of the ϕi on σw is only corrected linearly by the now non-zero third moment of the
W distribution.

Divergent Moments Case. When the variable e−w

z in (7) possesses a long-tailed distribution ρz, the limiting
≡
distribution is not a Gaussian and the results (9) and (11) no longer hold. In particular, if one of the tails of ρz(z)
decays as z−(1+α) with α < 2 (implying an inﬁnite Boltzmann variance, ˆσ2), then the distribution of the variable y
in (7) approaches a non-Gaussian stable law for large n [16]. Note that such power-law behavior in z corresponds
to simple exponential decay in the work distribution. Further, because the mean of e−w must be ﬁnite for ∆F to
exist [recall (5)], we also have α > 1. Unfortunately, no explicit forms for stable distributions are known in the range
1 < α < 2 [16].

ρ1 also alters the form of the asymptotic expansion of the sum-variable y dis-
tribution and, hence, the expansion of fn. Instead of (9), the distribution of the variable y (7) now takes the more

integer part of x. Note that we have omitted an asymmetry parameter, β = 1, of the stable laws [16] which will be

Development of the expansion of fn for large n in the case of diverging Boltzmann moments is more complicated,
and will only be sketched here. The basic strategy is to ensure that the coeﬃcients of the powers of 1/n are all
rendered in terms of convergent integrals, which requires both an expansion of the logarithm in (8), as well as series
and asymptotic expansions of ρα in (14) available from [14–16]. The asymptotic result for n
takes a reasonably
simple form, namely,

, and independent of any parameters of the distribution. This universal law, valid for the case when
the second Boltzmann moment is ﬁnite, is illustrated in Fig. 2. The gamma distribution of Boltzmann factors was
ρΓ(z, 10, 2); see (12). The “regulated power law” distribution is deﬁned by ρrp(z) = α/(1 + z)α+1, and we set α = 2.5.
Conclusions. Motivated by the need to understand the large-N asymptotic behavior of free-energy-diﬀerence
estimates based on a ﬁnite amount of data (N work values), we have presented a general statistical theory which
partially completes the task. Two cases were formally identiﬁed, distinguished by whether the second moment of
the distribution of Boltzmann factors of the required work values is ﬁnite. The asymptotic behavior was discussed
for both cases, and — for the ﬁnite-second-Boltzmann-moment case — an exact solution and a universal law were
presented.

Much remains to be done, both in terms of theory and applications. A question of particular practical interest
is whether parameter-free extrapolation procedures can be devised, particularly in light of the sensitivity of the
asymptotic behavior of ∆Fn to the width of the distribution of work values.

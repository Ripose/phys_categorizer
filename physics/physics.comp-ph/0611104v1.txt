Abstract

The concept of holography has lured philosophers of science for decades, and is becoming more

and more popular in several front areas of science, e.g. in the physics of black holes. In this paper

we try to understand things as if the visible universe were a reading of a lower dimensional hologram

generated in hyperspace. We performed the whole process of creating and reading holograms of

a point particle in a virtual space by using computer simulations. We claim that the fuzziness in

quantum mechanics, in statistical physics and thermodynamics is due to the fact that we do not

see the real image of the object, but a holographic projection of it. We found that the projection of

a point particle is a de Broglie-type wave. This indicates that holography could be the origin of the

wave nature of a particle. We have also noted that one cannot stabilize the noise (or fuzziness) in

terms of the integration grid-points of the hologram, it means that one needs to give the grid-points

a physical signiﬁcance. So we futher claim that the space is quantized, which supports the basic

assumption of quantum gravity. Our study in the paper, although is more qualitative, yet gives a

smoking gun hint of a holographic basis of the physical reality.

INTRODUCTION

The theory of holography was ﬁrst developed by Hungarian scientist Dennis Gabor around

1947-48 while working to improve the resolution of an electron microscope [1]. The ﬁrst

holograms were of poor quality, but the principle was good. According to the principle

of holography, a detailed three dimensional image of an object can be recorded in a two

dimensional photographic ﬁlm and the image can be reproduced back in a three dimensional

space. The complex patterned information stored in the ﬁlm is called ’hologram’ (see in Fig.

1). The holograms have a strange feature, unlike the conventional photographic ﬁlm, once

you cut a hologram into pieces each piece is capable of reconstructing the entire image,

although with lesser and varying resolutions.

FIG. 1: Image taken from [2]

The holographic concept has lured philosophers of science for decades [3, 4], and is be-

coming more and more popular in several front areas of science; attracting the researchers

of cosmology, astrophysics, extra-dimensions, string theory, nuclear and particle physics and

neurology [5] etc... One can ﬁnd hundreds of papers in the internet discussing the relevance

of holography in these ﬁelds. Some articles claim that our visible and highly complex uni-

verse is actually a hologram of a higher dimensional but simpler reality. The holographic

principle is now widely being used to relate seemingly unrelated things, like quantum me-

chanics and gravity [6]. Theoretical results about black holes suggest that the universe could

be like a gigantic hologram [7]. So our seemingly three-dimensional universe could be com-

pletely equivalent to alternative quantum ﬁelds and physical laws ”painted” on a distant,

2

vast surface.

On the same lines, in our paper we try to understand things as if the visible universe were

a reading of a lower dimensional hologram generated in hyperspace. Our procedure goes as

follows. To start with, we perform the whole process of creating and reading holograms in

a virtual space by using computer simulations. For simplicity we consider a point object

with no geometrical size at rest and at uniform motion. First, we create the hologram of

the point object using a reference beam and an object beam. Second, we read the created

hologram by illuminating it with a suitable reference beam.

Ideally, the reconstruction procedure should give back the original point object in our

normal physical space, but we know that no optical procedure gives a strictly point-like

image of a point-like object. Assuming holography as the basis of physical reality, we claim

that some dynamics seen in the observable world (such as fuzziness in quantum mechanics,

in statistical physics and thermodynamics) can come from such a procedure. This fuzziness

is basically a noise that has a dynamics of its own. In this work we will try to understand

this in detail.

In the ﬁrst section II we describe the creation and reading of hologram in usual space

and hyperspace. In the second section III we study the image created by the holographic

mapping of a single stationary point, and then reading the hologram. In the third IV section

we repeat this procedure for a linearly and uniformly moving point. Both III and IV will

suggest that the image of a point-like particle is a wave that is described by a de Broglie-type

of relation [8]. This supports our assumption of a holographic base of physical reality. We

have also noted that one cannot stabilize the noise (or fuzziness) in terms of the integration

grid-points of the hologram screen, it means that one needs to give the grid-points a physical

signiﬁcance. So we futher claim that the space is quantized, which concurs with the basic

assumption of quantum gravity.

In section VI we present the discussion and conclusions.

II. HOLOGRAPHIC MAPPING IN HIGHER DIMENSION AND READING OF

THE HOLOGRAM

In this section we ﬁrst describe the creation of holograms in usual space and hyperspace.

We create a two-dimensional hologram (II A). Next, we describe the reconstruction of the

3

hologram in the usual three-dimensional space (II B). It must be noted that the holograms

are not necessarily created by light, but can be formed in the presence of any wave action.

In principle they can be created and read with diﬀerent kind of waves, such as scalar,

vector (electromagnetic, acoustic), tensor (gravitational), and the calculation principles are

basically the same [9].

Since the motivation is to understand the usual three-dimansional world reality as a

holographic projection of some higher dimensional reality, we realize that we need atleast

ﬁve dimensions (3+2) to create the usual three-dimensional image (the objects we perceive

through our senses). The extra two dimensions are required for the reference and object

beams to propagate, since we do not see them.

A. Creating hologram

The hologram itself is the picture of the interference pattern of a beam that comes from

an object we want to map and a reference beam. For simplicity we assume a scalar beam,

but the result is the same for other waves as well [9], since, according to this reference, the

interference pattern does not depend on the spinorial structure of the wave (like scalar, vec-

tor, etc.). The hologram as well as its reading are interference patterns, so this independence

is understandable. The hologram is produced, as seen in Fig. 1 and 2, by splitting a single

beam into two pieces: one is shed on the object and the other directly on the photographic

plaque. In our case we assume a ﬁve-dimensional space with the holographic screen lying

on the (x, y) plane by construction. We take a beam that hits the object propagates in the

ﬁfth dimension and a reference beam that propagates in the (y, x4) plane. And there is an

angle ψr between the beam itself and the x4 axis. We didn’t take it in the (x4, x5) plane

because in such case the reference wave that hits the screen remains always normal to it.

We assume that the phase of the reference beam is φri at the point (y, x4) = (0, 0). The

wavelength of the radiation is λ = 2π/k and k is the wave number. Therefore the phase of

the reference beam at an arbitrary site is φr = φri + kx4 cos(ψr)
x4 = 0, so φr = φri −

ky sin(ψr).

−

This wave has an amplitude Er0, so its value is

ky sin(ψr). On the screen

Er = Er0 exp[i(φri −

ky sin(ψr))].

photographic ﬁlm on (x, y) plane. The dot represents the object beam propagating in the ﬁfth

dimension.

Likewise the phase of the beam that is reﬂected from the object is k(x5 + r), where r is

the distance between the object and an arbitrary point on the screen where we compute the

phase. The reﬂected wave therefore is

Eo = Eo0ei(φro +k(x5+r))/r(d−1)/2,

(2)

where Eo0 is a constant proportional to the square root of the surface of our object, the

square root of its reﬂectivity (R) and the original ﬁeld strength of the object beam. Here

d is the dimensionality of our space. However, φro is the initial phase of the wave which

hits the object. These two ﬁelds can be added together and squared, and then we have the

interference picture that is the hologram.

How do we determine Eo0? The energy that hits the object is SdE2

o0/2, where Sd is the

“cross section” of the object in d dimensions. Thus, in two dimensions it is 2ro (where ro is

the radius of the “spherical” object) in three dimensions it is πro

2, and by generalization,

for d dimensions it is Vd−1, where Vd is the volume of the d dimensional sphere. The energy
that comes out (Io) is R2 times the one that goes in (Ii). The energy is spread out on the

whole “solid angle” Ωd. Ωd is determined from the following identities:

In our calculations Ei

and Sd are the numerical inputs, which we choose so as to get the clear wave pattern with

The hologram is read once one sheds a wave on it and, the direction and the frequency

of this beam should be same as those of the reference beam that was used to create it. In

order to read hologram we will disgress from the way we created it. We will read it in 4D

space, since we don’t need object beam (the ﬁfth dimension), however our reading beam is

the same as the original reference beam that created the hologram.

In order to determine the image generated by a hologram when we shed some wave onto

it, one must know the reﬂected ﬁelds at any given point. The square of those ﬁelds is

6

proportional to the intensity of the reﬂected radiation, and knowing that, we can have an

analytical description of the generated image. If some wave is reﬂected from a surface (such

as a hologram), we can compute the reﬂected ﬁelds on the surface and we can examine

how those ﬁelds propagate. First we consider how static ﬁelds are determined from known

boundary conditions and after that we extend the calculation for wave ﬁelds.

The Green function G(~r) of a static ﬁeld is deﬁned as:

The ﬁeld at any given point can be calculated as:

where

∇n is the component of the derivative that is perpendicular to the surface.

The ﬁrst term refers to the sources and we assume that there are no sources in the part

of space we examine. The other two terms are the so-called surface terms. Whenever the

ﬁrst surface term vanishes (and the Green’s function must be chosen accordingly, so that it

vanishes on the surface) we must know the value of the ﬁeld on the surface, and we are said

to use the Dirichlet conditions. If we know only the derivatives of the ﬁelds on the surface,

we must require that the normal derivative of the Green’s function vanishes on the surface,

(8)

(9)

we are said to make use of a Neumann Green’s function. Note that any of these conditions

can be met at any time (although not both at the same time) because Eq. (6) does not

completely ﬁx the Green’s function, so we might add any term whose Laplacian is zero (in

the region of space we are interested in) in such a way that the new Green’s function satisﬁes

either one of the two conditions. Because we can calculate the ﬁelds at the surface, we will

use a Dirichlet Green’s function, so our ﬁeld at any given point is expressed as follows:

ϕ(~r′) =

d2~rϕ(~r)

∇nG(~r, ~r′)) .

− ZS

From the image solution for the auxiliary electrostatic problem, the Green function for

Dirichlet conditions can be calculated. We need to know the Dirichlet Green’s function on a

plane. First we deﬁne some new variables ~r1 and ~r2 as ~r1,2 = (x

(in terms of our orthonormal basis ~e1, ~e2, ~e3), r1,2 =

with k = ω/c as the wave number. We substitute this result into Eq. (11). How can we

justify this substitution, since Eq. (11) has been derived based on the assumption that the

ﬁelds are static? We know that if there is a wave ﬁeld, Eq. (9) is replaced with

the time Fourier transforms of the wave ﬁelds and Green’s functions and assume only one

frequency, we are able to make use of the static formulation of the problem using the Fourier

transform of the Green’s function we have just given in Eq. (14). The normal derivative of

this Green’s function on the surface deﬁned by the hologram is:

∇nG(~r, ~r′) =

(18)

and this we are able to substitute into Eq. (11). If the dimensionality were diﬀerent (but

greater than three), Eq. (19) would be modiﬁed in the following way:

∇nG(~r, ~r′) = βkz′ exp(

−
r′d−2

ikr′)

,

where d is the dimensionality of the space and β is an irrelevant constant we do not

even bother to give. Whenever we are reading the hologram, the only relevant diﬀerence

that comes from this formula is the phase given by the exponential, all the rest would be

irrelevant. Therefore it does not matter whether we read our hologram in a three or four

dimensional space. This we also conﬁrmed by our numerical calculations.

Now the only thing missing from the picture is the reﬂected ﬁeld at any given point of

the hologram. The phase and amplitude of the reﬂected wave depends on the phase and

amplitude of the reading wave:

(17)

(19)

Rh|
where ~Erf is the reﬂected wave, Rh is the reﬂectivity of the hologram (it is the hologram
data ﬁle generated in the previous step) and ~Erd is the reading wave (exactly same as the

reference beam in eq. 1).

~Erd = ˆxEr0 exp (

iky sin(ψr) + iφri) ,

(21)

−

9

where Er0 is its amplitude, φri is its phase at the point (y, x4) = (0, 0) and ψr is its

angle of incidence. By construction, the reading beam is the original reference wave (2) that

propagates in the (y, x4) plane. There is a phase shift of π after the reﬂection.

We incorporate Eqs. (11), (19), (20) and (21) in a numerical code to compute the reﬂected

ﬁelds (and therefore the intensities) at any given point of the space. Therefore, we obtained

the image from the hologram we were reading.

III.

IMAGES OF A STATIONARY POINT

In this section we describe the image created by reading a hologram of a stationary point.

Like any optical procedure, this process too will give us a blurry picture instead of a single

point. We will study the dynamics of this blurriness and try to read some physics into it.

The arguments of this section are not nearly as rigorous as those of the next one, they are

actually some kind of hand-waving arguments that only suggest some possible conclusions

rather than prove any. However, this is indicative for the direction of the next section that

is going to be somewhat more rigorous than the present one.

We consider a point-like object in a ﬁve-dimensional space. Why do we need ﬁve di-

mensions? As said before, we consider a reference beam and an object beam that are not

visible, therefore we need some extra dimensions. Since these two beams should propagate

in diﬀerent directions, the number of the extra dimensions is two. We then numerically

create its hologram that we will read in our usual three-dimensional space, but the beam

shed on our hologram will not be part of our three-dimensional space, since we cannot see

them.

Now we assume that the point-like object is separated by the center of our rectangular

screen (whose picture is the actual hologram) by a distance D, the sides of the screen are

equal and their size is d, and that the line of separation is perpendicular to the screen. For

the numerical integration that is involved in the reading of the hologram, we divided the

screen into 402 equal regions.

First, we consider the case when the image of our point resembles a Gaussian distribution.

This is the case, when, for example D = 5 units, d = 15 units and λ = 0.5 units which we

Now here comes our hand-waving and very qualitative argument. From thermal physics

we know that the width of the Gaussian distribution is proportional to the root mean

square of the momentum, prms. Therefore one can say that Λ

1/√p2, so Λ

1/prms.

This is a de Broglie type relation, where the wavelength is inversely proportional with the

momentum of the particle.

In our calculation we encountered a diﬃculty, however: the

result cannot be stabilized in terms of the gridpoints. For a diﬀerent number of gridpoints

we are able to get the same patterns and the same proportionality relations, but the graphs

are diﬀerent. This is understandable since the signal we investigate is basically a noise. The

only way out is to suppose that space is quantized. Therefore not only statistical physics

and quantum physics may be dependent, but qauntization of space could also be related to

these two.

IV.

IMAGES OF A MOVING POINT

A more elegant and compelling argument is the holographic mapping of a moving particle.

We imagine that the hologram is taken during a ﬁnite interval of time; meaning that in every

instant there is a snapshot, and these photographs are superposed, the resultant being the

ﬁnal hologram. The hologram then is read as we described in the previous sections. The

emerging pattern in this situation is again a wave (see Fig. 5). The only diﬀerence from

the former calculations is that on the RHS of Eq. (2) the exponent φr0 + kr, which is the

eikonal function of the wave ﬁeld is replaced with the full eikonal. We do this because the
moving point is also a dynamical system. Therefore this exponent becomes φr0 + kr + c ~P . ~

the particle and v is its velocity. We assumed a mass of 3200 units, than we repeated our

calculations by doubleing and halving it, and by using two other masses in this domain.

This way we proved that the wavelength depends on the momentum, but not on the mass

or velocity. We found that the wavelength Λ of this wave depends on the momentum P . We

considered D = 40 units, d = 1.5 units and λ = 5

10−3 units. We divided the screen into

702 equal squares in order to do the numerical integration involved in reading the hologram.

This calculation indeed suggests that within the limit of our errors the the Broglie relation,

Λ

1/P is satisﬁed. The only thing remaining to be clariﬁed is the origin of the spinorial

∼

structure for this wave. We propose that it has to be the same as that of the mapping wave.

V. FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS

We could ask the question: is there a more general argument that tells us that quantum

physics should come from an other principle? In other way is there another argument to

further justify, to strengthen our former reasoning of associating waves with spinor structure

to particles? The answer is positive, and we give this reasoning here, but its only disadvan-

tage is that it is completely general, does not even give us the de Broglie relation nor does

it tell us how to associate waves to particles, as we did in the former paragraphs.

Variational principles can be applied to a wide variety of systems. These systems either

have a ﬁnite degrees of freedom or inﬁnite degrees of freedom. Another possibility does not

exist. The former case is the mechanics of a ﬁnite number of points and the latter case is

basically a ﬁeld theory. In this section we discuss why the case of the point mechanics has

diﬃculties in the relativistic context, and propose a solution how this complication can be

solved.

For a point like particle, in the non-relativistic context, the variational principle reads:

Here m is the particle mass, v is its velocity, and V is its potential energy. This variational

The manifestly covariant principle reads:

But here u stands for the four-velocity and τ for the proper time. However, the conserved

Hamiltonian associated to this action is zero. So, it is impossible to introduce for a point like

particle a relativistic, manifestly covariant action principle that gives the right Hamiltonian.

On the other hand, this is possible for ﬁelds.

How do we solve then the issue of point-like particles? One way would be eliminating them

completely, but that would be eliminating a part of reality, since such particles exist. An

other way would be eliminating relativity or the need for a manifestly covariant description,

which has the same disadvantage of ignoring reality. The only remaining possibility would be

associating to any such a particle another system which does have a relativistic, manifestly

covariant description, and that could be only a ﬁeld. Any ﬁeld is a function that depends

on the spacetime, and that can be decomposed in plane waves, therefore it is a wave. But

the assertion that to every particle there is a corresponding wave is the basic assumption of

quantum physics. Therefore quantum physics, or at least a part of it, seems to follow from

relativity.

VI. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS

Quantum theory predicted that regardless of the distance between the particles, their

polarizations would always be the same. The act of measuring one would force the polariza-

tion of the other. This shows a spooky exchange of informations between the two particles,

which violates the principle of relativity. Alain Aspect’s experiment [11] at the university

of Paris has shown that under certain circumstances subatomic particles such as electrons

do communicate instantaneously. It doesn’t matter whether they are 1 meter or 1 billion

15

kilometers apart. This result is hard to digest, however a British physicist David Bohm [12]

claimed Aspect’s ﬁndings imply that objective reality doesn’t exist. Despite it’s apparent

solidity the universe at heart is phantasm, a gigantic and splendidly detailed hologram.

In other words, the separateness of things is but an illusion, and all things are actually

part of the same unbroken continuum. We see the separateness of things because we see the

partial reality. He gave a nice analogy of a ﬁsh in an aquarium, which is seen through two

TV cameras, focused on at diﬀerent angles, on two respective screens. It appears that there

are two ﬁshes, but simultaneously communicating, which is because either image of the ﬁsh

contains only a partial information, i.e. a lower dimensional reality.

There are speculations that our universe could be a hologram of higher dimensional reality

on the 4-D surface at its periphery. Theoretical results about black holes suggests that the

universe could be like a gigantic hologram [7]. So our innate perception that the world

is 3+1 dimensional reality could be just an illusion, and our seemingly three dimensional

universe can be a projection of a bigger reality.

In terms of informations the holographic principle holds that the maximum entropy or

information content of any region of space is deﬁned not by its ’volume’, but by its ’surface

area’. According to John A. Wheeler of Princeton University the physical world is made

of information, with energy and matter as incidentals. Holography may provide a guiding

torch to discover a better theory or ’Theory Of Everything’. So the ﬁnal theory might be

concerned not with ﬁelds, not even with spacetime, but rather with information exchange

among physical processes [7].

The revolution in the Holographic Principle is now a major focus of attention in many

area of science e.g. gravitational research, quantum ﬁeld theory and elementary particle

physics. A popular account of holography can be found in [6, 13, 14]. For a more technical

discussion see [15].

In this work we discovered that the holographic projection of a point particle is a wave

like structure. We have also noted that for a ﬁxed distance (D) of particle from the screen

of hologram and ﬁxed wavelength of the reference & object beam the there exists a relation

between momentum and wavelength of the wave pattern associated with the particle. This

relation is similar to the famous de Broglie-type relation: Λ

1/prms.

∼

Now, we conjecture here that since the relation (or the proportionality) between wave-

length and momentum is similar to that of the de Broglie relation, it could be the the

16

wave-pattern which we associate with all the particles in quantum mechanics. If this is so,

we then understand the origin of the wave like nature of quantum particles. This will also

show a holographic basis for the existence of this intire physical world. Whatever we see

around is a holographic projection of a bigger reality. In other words, that a point particle

is not seen as a point, but a fuzzy Gaussian wave that has been observed in quantum me-

chanical experiments. We can dare to say that the holographic projection wave of the point

particle is essentially the so-called de Broglie wave.

We also noted that there is a need to give a physical signiﬁcance to the grid points of

the hologram screen, which prove another assumption of quantum gravity: the space is

quantised. We want to go one step further and argue that for the macro particles (classical

objects) this fuzziness, noise and wave pattern due to holographic projection are weak and

so hard to observe. To test this argument one should bear in mind that now each point of

the particle is a source of object wave which will interfere with the reference wave and with

themselves. In our investigation, we got an impression [16] that although the computation

is much more complicated, but the ﬁnal reconstructed image of the object go sharper as the

size of the test object grows up. Such that for the classical objects the fuzziness due to the

holographic process will almost disappear and we can see only the physical size and shape

of the particle.

As said before the relation Λ

1/P and the wave pattern we found as a holographic

∼

projection of a point particle exist only in certain domains of the parameters that we used.

It would be interesting to investigate the domains of these parameters with some boundary

conditions e.g. λ

d, λ

D, λ

1/N, d

D and Λ > d/N. Even in the real world

≪

≪

≪

≪

there is a domain of validity for every physical theory. For example, quantum mechanics

and ﬁeld theory are valid if the calculated de Broglie wavelength is much bigger than the

planck scale, which can be perceived as the minimal disatnce between two points in the

quantized space-time continuum. And likewise, this wavelength must be much smaller than

the astronomical distances where general relativity sets in. In our next work we want to

investigate the validity domain of our conclusions if and whether or not this domain coincides

with the domain dictated by the former criteria [16].

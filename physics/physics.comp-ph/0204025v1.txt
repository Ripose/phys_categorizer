A method to calculate the bound states of three-atoms without resorting to
an explicit partial wave decomposition is presented. The diﬀerential form of the
Faddeev equations in the total angular momentum representation is used for this
purpose. The method utilizes Cartesian coordinates combined with the tensor-trick
preconditioning for large linear systems and Arnoldi’s algorithm for eigenanalysis.
As an example, we consider the He3 system in which the interatomic force has a
very strong repulsive core that makes the three-body calculations with standard
methods tedious and cumbersome requiring the inclusion of a large number of
partial waves. The results obtained compare favorably with other results in the ﬁeld.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years the 4He trimer has been the center of several theoretical investigations
(see, for example, Refs.
[1, 2, 3] and references therein). From all methods employed in
these studies, the Faddeev equations method is perhaps the most attractive since it reduces
the Schr¨odinger equation for three particles into a system of integral or diﬀerential equations
which can be used to study bound states and scattering processes in a rigorous way.

The diﬀerential form of the Faddeev equations has been proposed long ago by Noyes and
Fiedeldey [4]. Since then, these equations have been used in bound states calculations in
Nuclear and Coulomb systems [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] – just to mention a few references. The deriva-
tion and discussion by Merkuriev of the asymptotic boundary condition of the diﬀerential
Faddeev equations (DFE) [10], paved the way to use the DFE not only in bound-state cal-
culations but in investigations of scattering processes as well. For atomic systems, however,
some peculiarities of the inter-atomic interactions resulted in a limited use of DFE in both
bound and scattering calculations.

One of the peculiarities is that the interaction among atoms often contains very strong
repulsion at short distances which is diﬃcult to handle numerically. In addition, it generates
strong short range correlations implying that in atomic systems one should take into account
many partial waves in order to achieve convergence. These problems can hardly be solved by
using the computational power of modern computers and requires instead the development
of appropriate numerical techniques.

One such technique is the so-called tensor-trick proposed by the Groningen group [11, 12].
Application of the method in Nuclear and Coulomb systems showed that high accuracy

calculations can be made using low computer power. Another method is that of Cartesian
coordinates applied for the ﬁrst time in three body Faddeev calculations in [13]. The latter
method is suitable in describing the long-range behavior of weakly three-body bound states
correctly. This feature is crucial in calculating excited states close to the two-body threshold.
Yet another proposed method of solving the three-body problem is that of Ref. [14] in which
no explicit partial wave decomposition is required and only the total angular momentum
of the system is used. Within this total angular momentum representation method the
Faddeev operator has a very simple form that allows the construction of eﬀective numerical
schemes.

In the present work we have combined the aforementioned methods and, moreover, we
propose a new approach to overcome the diﬃculties arising from the short range repulsion.
We applied the overall procedure in bound state calculations of the He3 system using various
potentials and compare our results with other results previously obtained by various groups.
In Sec. II we describe the equations to be solved and formulate the appropriate boundary
conditions. In Sec. III the numerical method is presented. Our results are given in Sec.
IV while our conclusion are summarized in Sec. V. Some technical details for the ﬁeld
practitioners are shifted in the appendix.

II. FORMALISM

When considering a three-body system it is convenient to denote the two-body subsystems
by α, β and γ and introduce Jacobi coordinates which in the conﬁguration space are deﬁned
by

Assuming that in each two-body subsystem only one bound state exists, we can write the
asymptotic boundary conditions for the Faddeev component φ0 as follows

subsystem, ky = √E2 −
E3, E2 is the two–body bound state energy, and E3
the energy of the three-body system. The ﬁrst term corresponds to virtual decay into a
particle and a two-body bound system, usually denoted as 2+1, while the second term
corresponds to a virtual decay with an amplitude A(x/y, z) into three single particles
denoted as 1+1+1. The term corresponding to the latter conﬁguration decreases much
faster than in the 2+1.

In the present work the term corresponding to 1+1+1 virtual decay is neglected and
thus the asymptotic boundary conditions for the Faddeev component at suﬃciently large

The ﬁrst numerical calculation with the DFE were made by Laverne and Gignoux in
the early seventies [5]. Since then, many numerical methods were proposed. In the present
work we shall employ: i) Quintique splines [8] together with an orthogonal collocation [16]
procedure which allows us to construct a linear system of equations corresponding to Eq.
(11). In this way the bound state problem can be transformed to a generalized eigenvalue
problem. ii) The tensor-trick [11] to solve the eigenvalue problem using the restarting Arnoldi
algorithm [17].

Any regular solution of Eq. (11) fulﬁlling the boundary conditions (14) can be approxi-

mated by an expansion in terms of the basic functions (see Appendix A)

φ0(x, y, z) =

ˆHF = ˆH 0

When investigating nuclear systems with short-range potentials, such as the Malﬂiet-Tjon
V (MT-V) potential [18], the spectrum of the system (16) can be calculated by direct
application of the restarting Arnoldi or biorthogonal Lanczos algorithm. However, an
additional regularization is usually needed to accelerate the convergence. For this, one

is known as tensor-trick [11] and is brieﬂy described in Appendix B for Cartesian coordinates.

Following the standard procedure we write for the eigenvalue problem
( ˆH1 −

E ˆI)−1 ˆH2f = λ(E)f .

where for physical solutions we have λ(E) = 1. Eq. (18) can be solved using the Arnoldi
algorithm [17].

Although the above scheme can be applied eﬀectively for a wide range of potentials, it is
not satisfactory for interatomic potentials with a strong repulsive core. A typical example
is the helium dimer potential which has a core with enormously strong repulsion and an
extremely weak attractive well just enough to hold a two-body bound state. In what follows
we give a brief analysis of the diﬃculties that arise and propose a recipe to overcome these
diﬃculties.

Since to reproduce the correct long-range behavior of the Faddeev components Cartesian

coordinates are used, the natural choice of the operator ˆH1 in (18) is

ˆH1 = ˆH 0

0 + ˆV .

In this case the problem of calculating bound states is reduced to calculation of the largest
eigenvalues of the operator

ˆL(z)

(19)

≡ −

−
To demonstrate how the presence of a short-range repulsion manifests itself in the spectral
properties of the operators ˆL(z), one must compare the spectra of potentials with and
without a strong repulsive core. Two such potentials are the interatomic He–He TTYPT
potential [19] and the nucleon-nucleon (MT-V) potential [18] the spectra of which are
shown in Fig. 1. Two main features of the spectrum of the TTYPT potential should be
pointed out, namely, that the spectrum contains numerous large negative eigenvalues and
that for all values of the energy z, ˆL(z) has a number of eigenvalues close to one. According
to the estimations of the Arnoldi algorithm convergence rate (see Appendix C), these are
the features that make the convergence unacceptably slow.

In order to improve convergence we ﬁrst look for the origin of the negative part of the
1 of the operator ˆL(z).

Keeping in mind that the operator ˆV stands for a potential with extremely strong short-

To eliminate the negative eigenvalues from the spectrum, we introduce, instead of ˆL(z),

the operator

where ˆVm corresponds to some strong short-range repulsive potential.
It will be referred
to as modifying potential. It can be shown that the eigenvalues µi(zi) = 1 of the operator
ˆM (z) correspond to the eigenvalues zi of the original Faddeev operator and this does not
depend upon the modifying potential. In contrast, the eigenvalues µi(z) =
1 correspond
to the eigenvalues zi of the equation

Obviously, these eigenvalues depend on the choice of the modifying potential ˆVm a proper
choice of which will eliminate all eigenvalues of the equation (21) in the range zi ∈

Thus, according to Arnoldi algorithm convergence rate estimations, this feature of ˆM (z)
should dramatically improve the convergence to the maximal eigenvalue close to one.

(21)

The convergence rate can be further improved if instead of the operator ˆM a properly
selected function of ˆM is used in the calculations. One such function can be an even power of
ˆM (z) or the normalized Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind Uk( ˆM (z))/Uk(1). It allows
an upward shifting of the lower bound of the spectrum and the increase of the separation
between the physically interesting eigenvalues close to one and the rest part of the spectrum.
According to the convergence rate estimations these features allow the reduction of the
computation time and memory requirements considerably.

IV. RESULTS

We applied the aforementioned numerical procedure to study the spectrum of the He3
trimer system. For this purpose, we employed the most recent He–He potentials, namely,
the SAPT1, SAPT2, and HFD-B3-FC11 potentials [20], and compare the results with those
previously obtained [2] using the LM2M2 [21] and TTYPT [19] interactions, as well as with
those obtained via other methods.

In Table I we present the results for the trimer ground and excited states. We also
present, in the same table, the results obtained for the dimer binding energy E2 calculated
on the same grid used in three-body calculations as well as the exact results for the dimer

Our results for the LM2M2 potential are given in Table IV together with those obtained
by Motovilov et. al.
[22, 23] via Faddeev-type equations (boundary condition model
(BCM)) and by Nielsen et al. [1] via the hyperspherical adiabatic approach. It is seen that
an overall good agreement is achieved with these approaches. However, for the ground state
a slightly better agreement is achieved with the results of Ref.
[23] while for the excited

[23] coincide with our spline

with this simpliﬁed grid, we recovered all the digits of the ground state energy reported in
[23]. This conﬁrms the accuracy of their result and the suitability of the present method for
bound state calculations. The better agreement for the excited state with the one obtained
in Ref. [1] can be attributed to the 2+1 contribution to the Faddeev component for the
excited states. Taking into account this term in the BCM is very diﬃcult, whereas the
hyperspherical adiabatic approach of Nielsen et. al.
[1] is more suitable for this purpose.
However, the ground state energy of [1] is about 1% less than our result. Consideration
of the geometric properties of helium trimer can clarify the possible nature of the latter
diﬀerence.

The functions x(r1, r2, r3), y(r1, r2, r3), and z(r1, r2, r3) are obtained from the Jacobi co-
ordinates (1) and (8) and the wave function ψ(x, y, z) is normalized to unity. Due to the
symmetry properties of the system, the one-particle density function depends only on the

Omitting the integration over z, we obtain the conditional density function ρ(r, z) describing
a spatial distribution for particle one when the other two particles are located along a ﬁxed

of the position of particle 1 onto the axis connecting the other particles and

lated with the LM2M2 potential are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. The conditional
density function of the ground state decreases in all directions in a similar way. The den-
sity function of the excited state has two distinguishable maxima and exhibits the linear
structure of the cluster. This structure has a simple physical explanation: The most prob-
able positions of a particle in the excited state lie around the other two particles and when
the latter particles are well separated the third one forms a dimer-like bound state with
each of them. This interpretation agrees with the clusterisation coeﬃcients presented in the
Table VII. These coeﬃcients are calculated as a norm of the function fc deﬁned by

fc(y) =

where ϕ2(x) is the dimer wave function. The values of
demonstrate the dominating role of a two-body contribution to the trimer excited state
whereas in the ground state this contribution is rather small. We could suppose that
this dominating contribution of the cluster wave in the excited state ensured the fast
convergence of the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion [1] to the correct value, but in order
to get the same order of accuracy for the ground state, possibly more basic functions should
be taken into account.

The advantage of using Faddeev equations over the Schr¨odinger one in bound-state cal-
culations, is deduced from the results shown in Tables VIII and IX. In the latter table we

component or the wave function. The angular coeﬃcients for the Faddeev component de-
crease much faster than the wave function coeﬃcients. This could explain the diﬀerence
between the estimations of the trimer mean square radius reported in [2] and the one pre-
sented here. In the previous paper the same angular basis for the Faddeev component and
the wave function has been used. However, it turned out that the contribution of the higher
partial waves to the wave function is not negligible. This leads, for instance, to the change
of the mean square radius of the excited state for the LM2M2 potential from 60.85 ˚A to
59.3 ˚A. This observation agrees with the results of Nielsen et al. [1], who reported the value
60.86 ˚A using essentially the same angular basis both for the wave function and for the
Faddeev component. The Table VIII also demonstrates that more angular functions should
be taken into account in the ground state calculations.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We present a method which can be used to perform accurate three-body bound states
calculations.
It is specially suited for systems where the interparticle forces have a
strong repulsive core. The method is based on Faddeev equations in the total angular
momentum representation and without any further partial wave decomposition. The
equations are expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates which are best suited to
describe the long-range behavior of weakly three-body bound states. Combined with
the tensor-trick preconditioning for large linear systems and the Arnoldi’s algorithm for
eigenanalysis it provided us accurate results for the the He3 trimer bound and excited states.

Results obtained with the most recent realistic intermolecular forces (SAPT1, SAPT2,
HFD-B3-FC11), as well as with earlier forces (LM2M2, TTYPT) indicate that only two
bound states exist. The properties of these states are very diﬀerent with the ground state
being strongly bound while the binding energy for the excited state is comparable to that
of the dimer. The latter implies that a dimmer cluster within the molecule is well formed.

The sizes of these two states also diﬀers much. The characteristic size of the ground state
10 times less than the size of dimer molecule, but
either estimated by
the size of the excited state has the same order of magnitude with that of the dimer. This
estimation make it necessary to check for the absence of trimers in the experimental media
during the measurement of dimer properties and vice versa.

To obtain a system of equations for the coeﬃcients fi the expansion (A4) should be
substituted into Eq. (11) with some subsequent projection procedure. A reasonable choice
of such a procedure is the method of orthogonal collocations which do not require any
integration. The highest order of approximation is achieved by a careful choice of collocation
points for a given basic grid τ [16]. For the grids τNx, τNy and τNz one should construct
the grids of collocation points τN c

{
Given these collocation grids the matrix elements of the operators involved in Eq.

APPENDIX B: THE TENSOR-TRICK FOR CARTESIAN COORDINATES

The inversion procedure of the operator ( ˆH1 −

E ˆI) is crucial for the performance of
the algorithm and therefore a brief description of a tensor-trick algorithm for the DFE
in Cartesian coordinates will be given. Furthermore, as the matrices involved are large,
certain comments will be passed concerning the eﬃciency in computation.

Taking into account the tensor structure of the matrices ˜B∗ and ˜B this computation scheme

APPENDIX C: CONVERGENCE RATES FOR THE ARNOLDI ALGORITHM

The key point of this algorithm is the repeated action of the operator under consideration
on a sequence of vectors generating a Krylov subspace where the desired eigenvector lies.
To use this algorithm to solve the eigenvalue problem (18) one must be able to calculate the
E ˆI)−1 and ˆH2 on an arbitrary vector u. Thus the problems
action of the operators ( ˆH1 −
E ˆI) and storage of the matrix ˆH2 should be solved ﬁrst.
of inversion of the operator ( ˆH1 −
In Ref. [11] hyperspherical coordinates were used which lead to an eﬀective storage scheme
for the matrices ˆH2 = ˆV ( ˆI + ˆP ). However, one can not include pair interaction into the
E ˆI) using hyperspherical coordinates. On the other hand, if Cartesian
invertible part ( ˆH1 −
coordinates are used then one has diﬃculties with the storage of the matrix ˆP since these
coordinates do not have the same symmetry properties as the operator P and this results to
an irregular structure of ˆP . In our case the situation is saved by the total angular momentum
representation. In contrast to bispherical expansion used in [11], the operator P is local and
does not contain any terms requiring integration. As a result the matrix ˆP is sparse and can

13

be either eﬀectively stored using any standard storage scheme for sparse matrices [24] or not
stored at all. In the last case the matrix elements are calculated “on ﬂy” when required.

The estimations of the convergence rate of the Arnoldi algorithm [17] are essential in
understanding the problems that arise when the tensor-trick algorithm is applied. Suppose
ˆL is a linear operator in a ﬁnite-dimensional space with

ˆLui = λiui .
Km(v) be a Krylov subspace of dimension m constructed from a starting vector v of the
Km space. The convergence rate of the

Let
operator ˆL and
Pm be an orthogonal projector to
algorithm can be expressed in terms of the norm

of the eigenvector ui projection onto the orthogonal completion to

Then the following relation is fulﬁlled

where ξi =
depends on the spectral properties of the operator
ˆL. For the eigenvalues lying in the external part of the spectrum some practically important
estimations are known. Suppose that all the eigenvalues of ˆL but λ1 lye inside of an ellipse
e. It can then be shown that ǫ(m)

satisfy the following estimation [17]

where Cm(t) are Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind.

Consider now the convergence rate of Arnoldi algorithm for the operator ˆL(z) (19) for
the value of z corresponding to the ground state of a three-body system. In this case the
maximal eigenvalue λ1 = 1. Having deﬁned the separation distance between the largest
eigenvalue and the rest part of the spectrum s
, the distance between the maximal
eigenvalues in the rest part d
and neglecting the imaginary part of the spectrum,
we obtain the estimation

Therefore the parameter managing the convergence rate is the ratio s/d of the separation
to the size of the rest part of the spectrum. The convergence rate could be improved by
enlarging the separation and by enhancing the remainder part of the spectrum localization.

To understand the recent experiments of Kim and Chan which ﬁnd a superﬂuid-like response in
dense 4He, we calculate properties of a model of 4He in Vycor using the Path Integral Monte Carlo
method. We ﬁnd that 4He forms a distinct layered structure. The ﬁrst layer is solid-like and highly
localized. The second layer is disordered: some atoms are not localized and they could give rise to
the observed superﬂuid response. Higher layers are then nearly perfect crystals and only participate
in the superﬂuidity in so far as they are close to the second layer. The addition of a single 3He
atom was enough to bring down the total superﬂuidity because it goes into the second layer and
blocks the exchange in that layer. Our results are consistent with the persistent liquid layer model
to explain the observations.

A supersolid[1, 2, 3, 4] is a proposed phase of a quan-
tum system in which long-range crystalline order and su-
perﬂuidity coexist. Attempts to observe supersolid be-
havior in solid 4He were not successful [5] until recently:
Kim and Chan reported the observation of a supersolid
Helium phase, in porous Vycor [6] and more recently in
bulk solid 4He [7]. We focus here on the measurements of
the Helium-Vycor system. Related calculations on bulk
solid 4He are discussed elsewhere [8].

The occurrence of supersolid behavior in Vycor, a dis-
ordered porous glass, can be understood from the prop-
erties of Vycor. Chan suggested that the complex Vycor
geometry stabilizes mobile defects. At the low tempera-
tures (experimentally at 175mK), defects could condense
into a coherent state, and superﬂow would result. Kim
and Chan pressurized their cell to 60 Bars, substantially
above the believed freezing pressure for helium in Vycor
estimated at 40 bars. However, even if most of the helium
is solid, it is not clear if there remains a liquid ﬁlm near
the Vycor-helium surface even at these pressures. The
ﬁlm could arise from the mismatch of lattice parameters
as the density of 4He varies from the center of the pores
to their surface.

In order to understand the Kim-Chan experiment,
in particular to see what is happening at the micro-
scopic level, we propose a model of the helium-Vycor
system and calculate its properties with the Path Inte-
gral Monte Carlo(PIMC) method reviewed in [9]. Path
Integral Monte Carlo can calculate exact thermodynamic
properties of bosonic systems such as 4He at non-zero
temperature by sampling the thermal density matrix
ρ ≡ e−βH, with β = 1/kBT and H the Hamiltonian.
An explicit expression for the density matrix is obtained
by expanding into a path and approximating the higher
temperature density matrices(τ = M/β). Bose statis-
tics are obtained by symmetrizing the density matrix

perﬂuid and crystal phase [10, 11, 12].
In contrast to
methods based on trial wavefunctions, in PIMC only the
Hamiltonian enters, so no biases are made on the struc-

ture of the many-body system.

FIG. 1: The external potential V (z) experienced by the he-
lium atoms in “cell 2”. The Vycor is on the left side (z=-
12.5˚A) and solid helium on the right side (z=12.5˚A). The
inset is a 3D representation of the rough Vycor surface: the
black dots are the positions of the Vycor impurities placed
randomly at 1˚A away from the Vycor wall. The rugged sur-
face shows the positions of the helium atoms (located at the
vertices) in the ﬁrst layer.

Vycor’s complex geometry is diﬃcult to simulate di-
rectly. Under the transmission electron microscope, Vy-
cor shows interconnected pores with diameters between
60˚A and 80˚A and a length of 300˚A, with a narrow dis-
tribution of pore sizes. Current simulation techniques
treating all the atoms (roughly 30000 atoms/pore) with
PIMC are unable to simulate even a single pore.
It is
thought that above the freezing pressure (40 bars) a 4He
crystal will occupy the center of a pore [13]. Previous
PIMC calculations have found that a perfect crystal will
not have a superﬂuid response at long wavelength [8].
Making this assumption, we study only the region near
the surface of a pore and model it with the slab geom-
etry: our simulation cell is periodic in both the x and
y directions. In the negative z-direction there is a wall,
representing bulk Vycor on top of which are placed Vy-

cor “particles” in random positions 1 ˚A above the ﬂat
Vycor surface. These particles serve to make the surface
rough and break translational invariance. In the positive
z-direction is a wall which models bulk solid Helium at a
pressure of 62 bars(see Fig. 1) .

The main input to PIMC is the interaction potential
between various particles. We assume that the Helium-
Helium interaction is given by the Aziz [14] potential
which has been used within PIMC to study numerous
other properties of helium and gives energies accurate
to about 1% of the bulk binding energy. The potential
between helium and the upper wall was derived by inte-
grating an approximate LJ 6-12 potential (ǫ = 10.22K
and σ = 2.556˚A) over the volume z > 11.7˚A (cell 1)
resulting in a LJ (3-9) potential.

We also assume helium-Vycor surface interaction is a
z )3]. Since
LJ (3-9) potential [15]: V (z) = D
Vycor glass,SiO2, should behave similarly to MgO [16],
we pick the well depth to be D = −86.9K, and the range
of the attraction, ze = 3.6˚A. In order to pin the helium
crystal in the xy plane and model the roughness of the
Vycor, we add Vycor “particles” in random positions 1
˚A above the wall. The interaction between the helium
atoms and the Vycor particles is determined by demand-
ing that a complete layer of the particles give the same LJ
(3-9)potential; this is done by inverting the above equa-
tions. Experiments [17] show that the roughness in Vycor
is on the scale of 0.8nm, not very diﬀerent from what we
have assumed. Figure 1 shows the wall potential and
the surface roughness.

We set the helium density to match the experimental
conditions by adjusting the number of helium atoms and
the total area in the xy plane so that the helium den-
sity in the topmost layer matches that of solid 4He at a
target pressure close to 62 bars. We start the simulation
with 221 atoms placed in 7 layers in an hexagonal closed
packed solid phase. Each layer contains 30 atoms except
for the ﬁrst layer placed at the strongly attractive Vy-
cor wall potential (Fig. 1). We have performed extensive
simulations with two geometries, denoted as Cell 1 (221
He atoms with a box 17.75 × 18.45 × 23.4˚A3) and Cell 2
(221 atoms with a box 17.25 × 17.93 × 25˚A3). Cell 1 is
roughly stress free, while Cell 2 provides us with a way
to look at the model under anisotropic stress.

The density in the z-direction (see Fig. 2) shows a dis-
tinct layered structure of 4He. The density increases as
we approach the Vycor wall because of the stronger at-
traction of the potential well. The Vycor particles distort
the shape of the density peak in the ﬁrst layer because
there are binding sites at diﬀerent values of z. We ﬁnd a
perfect crystal is stable in the upper portion of the cell
with a lattice constant of 3.55˚A in cell 1 and 3.45˚A in
cell 2, at the target pressure of 62 bars. We estimate the
pressure by calculating the density per layer from ﬁg-
ure 2 and comparing it with the experimental equation

the peak of S(k) around k0=2.04˚A−1 as shown in ﬁgure 3
for cell 1; the peak clearly shows an hexagonal structure
for layers three and above. The density proﬁles within
a layer in Fig. 3 conﬁrm this interpretation. However,
not all of the layers are solid. In fact, layer one is solid-
like with the helium atoms well-localized but with their
mean positions highly constrained by the underlying dis-
order. Layer 2 is more disordered and the atoms are out
of registry with the ﬁrst layer. Because the second layer
density is lower, the atoms are much less localized and, as
we shall see, are able to become superﬂuid. Layers three
and above are quantum solids, mostly free of defects.

FIG. 3: Top: Contour plots of the helium density in the x-y
plane in the ﬁrst three layers at 0.2K for cell 1. In the ﬁrst
layer above the Vycor, the atoms are pinned by the strong
Vycor interaction, in the second layer they are relatively delo-
calized, whereas the higher levels show a density distribution
characteristic of bulk solid 4He. Bottom: The layer-speciﬁc

as we lower the temperature as shown in ﬁgure 4 and
approaches values of about 4% below 0.3 K.

Before we confront experiment, we want to ﬁnd the
spatial distribution of the superﬂuid density. In principle,
superﬂuidity is a global quantity; however, we can divide
the winding number estimator into local contributions
that sum to the total superﬂuid density [20]. The average
superﬂuid density as a function of the distance above the
Vycor wall χ(z) is:

In ﬁgure 2, we show χ(z) for T=0.2K in cell 1. One
can see the layered structure of the density. Layer 2 has
the largest superﬂuid component. Layer one contributes
because of some 4He atoms that are delocalized by Vy-
cor impurities and sit close to layer 2. Layer 3 is also
active. The superﬂuid response goes to zero above layer
3. However, this decay is quite slow in cell 2 where the
two additional layers (4 and 5) still contribute to ρs/ρ.

To compare with experiment we must make two cor-
rections; ﬁrst that our model has a larger number of
atoms closer to the Vycor surface area than experiment,
and second that our cell has no tortuosity: the exper-
imental path length for a superﬂow is greater than the

straight line distance. We correct for the diﬀerence in
Vycor surface area by assuming that the superﬂuidity
is conﬁned to a ﬁnite distance above the Vycor so that
the eﬀective number of atoms that do not respond to
the moving boundaries is: Ns = σA where A is the Vy-
cor surface area (actually the surface area of the mobile
layer). We ﬁnd that the maximum number of super-
ﬂuid atoms per unit area is: σ ≈ 2.7nm−2. Then for
a Vycor sample with experimental surface area per unit
volume of a = 0.2nm−1 the relative superﬂuid response
would be aσs/µρκ where µ = 0.3 is the experimental
Vycor sample pore fraction, κ = 5 is the tortuosity, and
ρ = 31.66atom/nm−3 is the solid number density. Us-
ing the characterization of Vycor, we would predict a
measured superﬂuid fraction of 0.011. In fact, Kim and
Chan measure a value two times smaller than this. One
important eﬀect missing in our calculation is that the su-
percurrents must tunnel through various weak links, an
aspect not in our calculations because of the limited ex-
tent of the cell in the x-y directions. In addition, we have
not taken the thermodynamic limit, though it is not ob-
vious how to do this without a better model of the Vycor.
In any case, Kim and Chan’s measured values are well
within the range expected from our calculations.

Kim and Chan also studied the eﬀect of 3He impurities
on the measurement of the superﬂuid density. Accord-
ingly, we replaced a single 4He with a 3He atom. (Note
that we do not need to consider fermi statistics for a
single fermion). This corresponds to roughly 0.3% con-
centration of 3He (assuming our cell size is ≈ 2/3 of the
pore). Experimentally, this concentration was enough
to destroy any “supersolid” response. The mass diﬀer-
ence between 3He and 4He, giving a larger kinetic energy,
causes the 3He path to occupy more space than a 4He
atom. This extra space is available in the second layer.
The 3He atom is not allowed to exchange with the 4He
and thus will locally reduce the superﬂuid density. Since

the impurity did not always ﬁnd the most favorable con-
ﬁguration, i.e. one with lowest energy, we devised a new
move that swapped the identity of the impurity with a
random 4He particle at a given frequency. This procedure
quickly reached equilibrium.

The density proﬁles show that the 3He impurity pref-
erentially goes to the same site where the superﬂuidity
is maximized (Fig. 2). At higher temperatures, it tun-
nels to other layers with an excitation energy of 0.8K. As
the temperature is lowered, two competing eﬀects take
place. The 4He atoms closest to the Vycor wall exchange
causing superﬂuidity. However, the 3He atom migrates
towards the most superﬂuid layers, hence diminishing the
total response of the system. The dense ﬁrst layer has
an insigniﬁcant density of 3He. In ﬁgure 4, it caused a
general decrease in total superﬂuidity and a shift towards
a lower transition temperature. It is plausible that in a
larger cell, an even smaller concentration of 3He could
pinch oﬀ the winding exchanges (or supercurrent) by go-
ing to choke positions not present in our small cell, thus
giving better agreement with the experimental ﬁndings
of a critical 3He concentration of 0.1%.

Our results show superﬂuidity localized in speciﬁc lay-
ers of 4He above the Vycor surface. We obtain a super-
ﬂuid response about 2 times what is observed, but the
diﬀerence is likely due to the very small simulation cells
we used which do not have the full range of the ran-
dom disorder. It is found that 3He impurities gravitate
to the same spatial locations as the superﬂuid density,
thus poisoning the eﬀect. Based on these simulations, the
“persistent liquid ﬁlm” interpretation of the Kim-Chan
experiment seems not to be ruled out.

Kim and Chan[6] mention two pieces of evidence to ar-
gue against the liquid ﬁlm interpretation. First, the ob-
served temperature dependance of the superﬂuid density
is unlike that of ﬁlms. However, the ﬁlms under pressure
are totally enclosed within a solid and they are not like
ﬁlms forming an interface between a solid and a vacuum;
as we have seen, there are low energy excitations giving
rise to pronounced temperature eﬀects, not present in
the later case. Also, the connectivity of these new ﬁlms
could be diﬀerent; it is likely that they are gossamery,
as opposed to the robust ﬁlms resulting when the pores
are only partially ﬁlled. The second eﬀect mentioned by
Kim and Chan is the poisoning by small amounts of 3He.

4

This does not happen in free ﬁlms because the 3He atom
could be located above the plane of the 4He ﬁlm and thus
not be eﬀective in preventing 4He exchanges. Also, there
are less likely to be choke points where a small amount
of 3He can kill an entire exchange path. Further studies
with larger cells and more realistic disorder are needed
to ﬁrm up these conclusions.

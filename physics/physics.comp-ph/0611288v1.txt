A novel low complexity method to perform self-consistent electronic-structure calculations using
the Kohn-Sham formalism of density functional theory is presented. Localization constraints are
neither imposed nor required thereby allowing direct comparison with conventional cubically scaling
algorithms. The method has, to date, the lowest complexity of any algorithm for an exact calculation.
A simple one-dimensional model system is used to thoroughly test the numerical stability of the
algorithm and results for a real physical system are also given.

Low complexity electronic-structure methods [15], us-
ing the Kohn-Sham density functional approach [1, 2],
where the operation count scales with respect to sys-
tem size (‘N -scaling’) as N α where α ≤ 2 have been
around for a few decades. A comprehensive review of low
complexity methods is given in reference [3]. Contrary
to what is often reported the theoretical upper bound
for the N -scaling of an exact self-consistent algorithm
has been set at O(N 2) ever since Fermi operator ex-
pansion (FOE) methods were developed [4]. This letter
shows how the theoretical upper bound for the scaling
of such calculations can be lowered to O(α(d, N )N
)
where d is the dimensionality of repetition of a full three-
dimensional system and α(1, N ) = log2(N ), α(2, N ) ≤ 2
and α(3, N ) ≤ 4/3. For large scale calculations low
complexity algorithms are without doubt the future of
electronic-structure implementations. However, low com-
plexity ab initio algorithms are not in common usage at
the moment, primarily due to two main reasons. Firstly,
much of the work currently being carried out deals with
systems that are too small to be amenable to low com-
plexity approaches if high accuracy is desired. Secondly,
low complexity algorithms are not yet fully functional
and fully stable for general systems - so a suﬃcient level
of conﬁdence in using these codes has not been estab-
lished. While the ﬁrst reason is rapidly being diminished
due to the ever reducing cost of a ﬂoating point opera-
tion, the second may prove to be far more stubborn.

Most low complexity algorithms fall broadly into two
categories; either they attempt to calculate localized or-
bitals or they seek to evaluate the density matrix (DM)
directly. For a general system only the latter is known
to provide a low complexity solution.
In the case of a
metal, for example, delocalized states at the Fermi level
prevent the occupied subspace being represented in terms
of orthogonal localized orbitals.

Problems associated with low complexity approaches
commonly stem from the imposition of a priori local-
ization constraints. The eﬀect of this restriction varies
depending on the algorithm and physical system. In or-
bital minimization algorithms even the initial guess can

alter the obtained solution.
In some cases localization
will always cast a degree of doubt over the ﬁnal answers
(except in the simplest wide-gap systems), and in oth-
ers prohibits obtaining the relevant physics/chemistry all
together. Fermi operator expansion (FOE) algorithms
(either using a polynomial [4, 5] or rational [6] approx-
imation) for systems with a DM localized in real-space
provide arguably the most natural and foolproof way of
obtaining results in O(N ). In these methods the locality
does not necessarily have to be imposed a priori, rather
the system can be allowed to inform us of the locality
in a systematic way. Methods that impose unsystematic
localization are invariably open to more doubt. While
a great deal of progress has been made in understand-
ing the inherent locality present in many systems, low
temperature metallic systems and charged insulating sys-
tems with long-ranged DM correlations are still a signif-
icant challenge. The method presented in this letter is
primarily aimed at such systems. However, it has also
been noted that the onset of sparsity of the DM, even for
wide-gap systems, is ‘discouragingly slow’ [7] especially
if high accuracy is required. The main advantage of the
method in this work is that it relies purely on the locality
of the basis functions allowing the use of non-orthogonal
localized basis sets, such as Gaussians, with rather less
localized orthogonal and dual complements. Also, the
full DM need not be explicitly calculated.

The energy renormalization group (ERG) approach [8,
9, 10] is a beautiful and elegant concept that has also
been suggested to cope with such diﬃcult problems. In
an ideal implementation it may be possible for its scaling
to better the method given here for d > 1 and equal
it for d = 1. However, it remains unclear whether an
ERG algorithm can also provide the density in an eﬃcient
manner and to some extent the ERG method employs
cutoﬀs. Therefore, the ERG method will not be included
in the deﬁnition of FOE methods in the following.

To date, standard FOE methods have been considered
to scale quadratically for systems where the DM decay
length is of the order of the system size. This can be the
case for very large systems especially for metals at low

2d−1

temperature or if high accuracy is required. The method
presented here imposes no localization constraints and
d ) where α(d, N ) is a weak loga-
scales as O(α(d, N )N
rithmic factor for d = 1 and tends to a constant in higher
dimensions. Not only does this represent a new theoreti-
cal upper bound for the N -scaling of an exact algorithm
(upto the basis set limit) it is also expected to make a sig-
niﬁcant and immediate impact on systems of low dimen-
sionality. Furthermore, for d = 1 it can be implemented
using exclusively standard direct linear algebra routines
(eg. LAPACK) for the bulk of the computation. This
is because a d = 1 Hamiltonian (with zero or periodic
boundary conditions) can always be arranged so that it
is a banded matrix, with a bandwidth that is indepen-
dent of system size, if it is constructed from localized
basis functions.

We now turn to what will be referred to as the recursive
bisection density matrix (RBDM) algorithm. We begin
with a rational approximation of the density matrix [16]

where β and µ are the inverse temperature and Fermi
energy respectively. The inverses of the shifted Hamilto-
nians in equation (1) may be evaluated by solving linear
equations. A number of methods to construct such ratio-
nal approximations have previously appeared in the lit-
erature [11, 12, 13]. For a given temperature, the condi-
tion of the shifted matrices is asymptotically independent
of system size. Therefore, if no localization of the DM
can be taken advantage of the solution of each equation
requires O(N ) operations. Since we must solve O(N )
equations the overall scaling is O(N 2) - as stated previ-
ously. A key point is that to calculate the band-structure
energy and density

using a localized basis set {φi} only requires elements of
the DM that lie within the sparsity pattern of the Hamil-
tonian. The inverse of such a shifted matrix is clearly

FIG. 1: Schematic of bisection of matrix inverses for d = 1.
The broad diagonal line represents the band of the matrix.
The narrow vertical lines represent the columns of the matrix
−1 that are calculated. The dashed horizontal
inverses (H −zk)
lines are rows that are known from the calculated columns
due to the matrix being symmetric. These rows then specify
boundary conditions for smaller sets of independent linear
equations at each sweep (a-d).

We may then proceed with a recursive bisection of
the matrix approach without approximation. The eas-
iest way to demonstrate this principle is to see how one
can obtain the density for a d = 1 system, such as a lin-
ear molecule or carbon nanotube. For such a system the
Hamiltonian is a banded matrix. The width of the band,
although independent of system size, is implementation
and system speciﬁc. Therefore, for the sake of clarity
a truly one-dimensional system will be considered. The
simplest Hamiltonian we can imagine is a ﬁnite-diﬀerence
stencil representing the Laplacian and the local potential
represented on a grid of spacing h

Hii = 1/h2 + V (xi)
Hij = −1/(2h2), |i − j| = 1
Hij = 0, |i − j| > 1.

where {λi} and c are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
H respectively. For simplicity the Hamiltonian matrix H
in equations (1)-(4) is taken to be constructed from an
orthogonal basis. Generalization to the non-orthogonal
case simply requires replacing (H − zk) with (H − zkS)
throughout and noting that the eigenvectors in equations
(3) and (4) satisfy cT Sc = I where S is the overlap matrix
of the basis functions.

As this matrix is tridiagonal, a submatrix (on the diag-
onal) of H requires two boundary points to determine
the linear equation (Hsub − zk)x = b. Fig. 1 shows a
schematic of the RBDM strategy for d = 1. After the
ﬁrst sweep (Fig 1 (a)) the ﬁrst, central and last columns
are known. From the rows (known as the matrix is sym-
metric) we now have boundary conditions of two smaller
problems which can be solved independently (Fig 1 (b)).

We may then bisect these two subproblems in a similar
fashion (Fig 1 (c)). The process continues until the di-
mensions of the submatrices are comparable to the band-
width of the matrix (Fig 1(d)), and then direct evalua-
tion can be used for the remaining subproblems (smallest
blocks on the diagonal in Fig 1(d)).

We now turn to the scaling of the method for 1 ≥ d ≤
3. We start with a cubic system and imagine increas-
ing the size of the system by a factor γ in d dimensions
thereby increasing the total size of the system by γd.
Firstly, we consider only the cost of the ﬁrst bisection
(Fig 1 (a)) of the system and we consider the DM to
have eﬀectively inﬁnite range. To bisect the system into
two subsystems requires calculating ncol columns (rep-
resented by vertical lines in Fig 1) of the DM and each
column requires O(N ) operations to compute. As the
system size is increased γ(d−1)ncol columns are required
to bisect the system. Therefore, the ﬁrst sweep scales
as O(N (2d−1)/d) - and this is the leading term. This
bisection operation must then be repeated until all of
the desired elements of the DM have been calculated.
The number of bisections required goes like log2d(N ).
The number of operations required to perform sweep m
(m > 1) is ∼ N1/2(d−1)(m−1) where N1 is the number
of operations to perform the ﬁrst sweep. Therefore, the
total number of operations may be written as

Ntot ∝ N (2d−1)/d

∼log2d (N )
X
m=0

1
2(d−1)(m−1) .

(6)

For d = 1 the summation is clearly proportional to
log2 N . However, in higher dimensions the summation
is a convergent series and gives 2 for d = 2 and 4/3 for
d = 3. This is an upper bound for the number of opera-
tions. Elaborate bisection schemes may reduce the total
number of operations but the leading scaling with N will
not be aﬀected. Hamiltonians with broader bands from
the use of more extended basis functions or non-local
pseudopotentials require an increase in ncol, however, this
does not aﬀect the N -scaling.

Another important aspect of any algorithm is numer-
ical stability. As many elements of the DM rely on pre-
vious solutions of linear equations we may expect errors
to accumulate the more bisections we use. It is diﬃcult
to gauge the precise eﬀect on the total energy, however
we may concentrate on a single inverse and assume the
worst case scenario. If we take one of our shifted matri-
ces that is closest to being singular (the matrix shifted
closest to the Fermi energy) (H − zc) then the error in
solving for one column of the matrix is proportional to
ǫmκ(H − zc) where ǫm and κ are machine precision and
condition of the matrix respectively. At worse we may
expect the error to grow linearly with the bisection num-
ber, though a random-walk accumulation leading to a
square root dependence is more realistic. Fig. 2 shows
this slow drift in the value of T r(H(H − zc)−1) where

(H − zc)−1 is a very ill conditioned matrix (certainly as
ill-conditioned as any in a realistic electronic structure
calculation). However, each submatrix will have eigen-
value range similar to that of the full matrix but a less
clustered eigenspectrum. This will render sub-linear sys-
tems becoming further from singularity during the bi-
section process. The numerics in a full calculation are
clearly very complex. One-dimensional model systems
were extensively tested in single precision, including dou-
ble precision iterative improvement of the solutions, from
a range of ill-conditioned matrices. In some cases increas-
ing the bisection number produced results closer to that
of double precision diagonalization and no catastrophic
numerical instabilities were detected.

As a ﬁnal example we take a more physically realis-
tic Hamiltonian. A minimal Gaussian basis was used
to construct Hamiltonian and overlap matrices for linear
CnH2n+2 molecules using a norm-conserving non-local
pseudopotential [14]. To obtain a physically reasonable
eigenspectrum using the minimal basis for this molecule
requires basis functions with a spatial extent which cor-
responds to the bandwidth of the matrix being approxi-
mately 50. This corresponds to a chain length of around
8 carbon atoms before the bandwidth of the matrix be-
comes less than the dimension of the matrix. For test-
ing purposes a low temperature (∼ 0.04eV ) Fermi dis-
tribution distribution with µ taken to be an eigenvalue
in the valence band was chosen. This corresponds to a
highly charged insulating system with a long range DM
(Fig. 3) and also provides an ill-conditioned problem
ideal to test numerical stability. The absolute/relative
error, compared to direct diagonalization, for the 1001
atom C333H668 was ∼ 10−10/10−13 and 5 bisections were
required. This further puts into context the numerical

drift mentioned in the previous section. No iterative im-
provement was used in this example, only full double
precision arithmetic, and the ill-conditioning of the lin-
ear systems represents the worst case in a typical calcu-
lation. Therefore, in a realistic calculation, chain lengths
containing at least one million basis functions in one-
dimension (and more in higher dimensions) should be ac-
cessible (by which point the natural decay of the density
matrix will surely limit the number of required bisections
in any case).

We now discuss some further implementation issues.
For large systematic basis sets the memory required to
store the boundary conditions may become prohibitive
- especially in three dimensions. The method can over-
come this to some extent by bisecting the system by a
factor, q, greater than two and building up the density
matrix in segments. However, when using large basis
sets, a smaller ﬁltered set of basis functions expanded
in terms of the underlying basis would be a more real-
istic approach. It can now be clearly seen how conven-
tional linear algebra can be used for d = 1 systems. A
banded matrix can be LU factorized in O(N ) operations
and a linear equation solved in O(N ) using direct meth-
ods. Therefore, for d = 1 iterative algorithms need not
be considered - this is useful when using localized basis
functions such as Gaussians where iterative methods are
still diﬃcult to precondition. Also, the matrices shifted
close to µ, at low temperature, become close to singular
therefore even basis sets that can be readily precondi-
tioned in a conventional sense (by damping of high ki-
netic energy components) will also suﬀer in this regime,
so direct methods are desirable. As solving sparse linear
systems of equations forms the kernel of the method it
is naturally open to any advances in direct sparse solvers
for systems where d > 1.

In principle, a similar procedure can be used if one opts
for a polynomial, rather than a rational, approximation
If F (H) is approximated by a
to the Fermi function.
np
k ωkH k, we may construct
polynomial in H, F (H) ≃ P
a set of columns of H k[k = 2, ..., np] and store the nec-
essary boundary matrix elements for each k in a similar
fashion to that already described above.

Even if a system has a DM that is suﬃciently localized
to take advantage of the RBDM method can still be used
to dramatically reduce the prefactor if the localization
regions are signiﬁcantly larger than the spatial extent of
the basis functions. This will often be the case if highly
accurate relative energies are desired. Also, the inverses
of Hamiltonians shifted far from the real-axis have more
rapid decay allowing true O(N ) evaluation (Fig. 3).

In conclusion, a simple modiﬁcation of FOE meth-
) scal-
ods has been presented allowing O(α(d, N )N
ing where α(1, N ) = log2(N ), α(2, N ) ≤ 2 and α(3, N ) ≤
4/3 without the need for localization. This is a especially
useful for systems of low dimensionality with long-ranged
DM correlations.

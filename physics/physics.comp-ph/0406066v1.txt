Abstract

An algorithm has been developed for the GEANT4 Monte-Carlo package for the efﬁcient
computation of screened Coulomb interatomic scattering. It explicitly integrates the classi-
cal equations of motion for scattering events, resulting in precise tracking of both the pro-
jectile and the recoil target nucleus. The algorithm permits the user to plug in an arbitrary
screening function, such as Lens-Jensen screening, which is good for backscattering calcu-
lations, or Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark screening, which is good for nuclear straggling and
implantation problems. This will allow many of the applications of the TRIM and SRIM
codes to be extended into the much more general GEANT4 framework where nuclear and
other effects can be included.

1 Introduction

The necessity of accurately computing the characteristics of interatomic scattering
arises in many disciplines in which energetic ions pass through materials. Tradi-
tionally, solutions to this problem not involving hadronic interactions have been
dominated by the well-known TRIM [1] and SRIM [2,3] codes. These codes take
a Monte-Carlo approach to computing distributions of ions passing through a ma-
terial, and use a universal parameterized formula to determining a scattering angle
for a particle which collides with a target nucleus. This formula is a parameteriza-
tion of the scattering integrals computed from a parameterization of an interatomic
screening function. This approach is reasonably successful, but not very ﬂexible.
In particular, it is relatively difﬁcult to introduce into such a system a particular
screening function which has been measured for a speciﬁc atomic pair, rather than
the universal functions which are applied.

In recent years, a more general framework, GEANT4 [4,5], has been being de-
veloped by the high-energy physics community for the handling of the motion of
energetic particles through matter. Like TRIM and SRIM, it takes a Monte-Carlo
approach to produce statistical distributions of particles as they move through var-
ious types of matter. However, GEANT4 has developed a much larger toolkit than
SRIM for handling very complex geometries, and for including many physical pro-
cesses other than just the traditional electronic stopping and nuclear stopping in its
computation. In many problems of current interest, such as the behavior of semi-
conductor device physics in a space environment, nuclear reactions, particle show-
ers, and other effects are critically important in modeling the full system. Thus, it
is important to have components in the GEANT4 toolkit to bridge the gap between
the effective handling of low-energy processes in simple geometries provided by
SRIM and the very general framework for nuclear events and complex geometries
already available in GEANT4.

To be consistent with the general GEANT4 philosophy of providing tools which are
ﬂexible and extensible as better physics models become available, it was decided
that introducing Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) universal scattering method [6]
into GEANT4 was inappropriately limiting. Although for most problems to which
SRIM is applied, the accuracy of the universal scattering equations is sufﬁcient,
it is easy to imagine that for situations in which precise event rates are needed,
one might wish to include high-precision measured interatomic potentials into a
computation. The approach described below makes this very simple, while allowing
one to use the well-established ZBL screening function [7] (but not the ZBL ’magic
formula’ for scattering integrals) for the many situations in which it is sufﬁciently
accurate.

2 Method

The method used in this computation is a variant of a subset of the method described
by the authors in a previous paper [8]. A very short recap of the basic material
is included here. The scattering of two atoms from each other is assumed to be
a completely classical process, subject to an interatomic potential described by a
potential function

V (r) =

Z1Z2e2
r

r
a

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where Z1 and Z2 are the nuclear charges, e2 is the electromagnetic coupling con-
stant, r is the inter-nuclear separation, f
is the screening function describing the
effect of electronic screening of the bare nuclear charges, and a is a characteristic
length scale for this screening. In most cases, f
is a universal function used for all
ion pairs, and the value of a is an appropriately adjusted length to give reasonably
accurate scattering behavior. In the method described here, there is no particular
need for a universal function f
, since the method is capable of directly solving the
problem for most physically plausible screening functions. It is still useful to deﬁne
a typical screening length a in the calculation described below, to keep the equa-
tions in a form directly comparable with our previous work even though, in the end,
the actual value is irrelevant as long as the ﬁnal function f (r) is correct. From this
potential V (r) one can then compute the classical scattering angle from the reduced
center-of-mass energy e

and x0 is the reduced classical turning radius for the given e and b

.

The problem, then, is reduced to the efﬁcient computation of this scattering inte-
gral. In our previous work, a great deal of analytical effort was included to proceed
from the scattering integral to a full differential cross section calculation, but for
application in a Monte-Carlo code, the scattering integral q c(Z1, Z2, Ec, b) and an
estimated total cross section s 0(Z1, Z2, Ec) are all that is needed. Thus, we can
skip algorithmically forward in the original paper to equations 15-18 and the sur-
rounding discussion to compute the reduced distance of closest approach x0. This

computation follows that in the previous work exactly, and will not be reintroduced
here.

For the sake of ultimate accuracy in this algorithm, and due to the relatively low
computational cost of so doing, we compute the actual scattering integral (as de-
scribed in equations 19-21 of [8]) using a Lobatto quadrature of order 6, instead
of the 4th order method previously described. This results in the integration accu-
racy exceeding that of any available interatomic potentials in the range of energies
above those at which molecular structure effects dominate, and should allow for fu-
ture improvements in that area. The integral a

The other quantity required to implement a scattering process in GEANT4 is the
total scattering cross section s 0 for a given incident ion and a material through
which the ion is propagating. This value requires special consideration for a pro-
cess such as screened scattering. In the limiting case that the screening function
is unity, which corresponds to Rutherford scattering, the total cross section is in-
ﬁnite. For various screening functions, the total cross section may or may not be
ﬁnite. However, one must ask what the intent of deﬁning a total cross section is,
and determine from that how to deﬁne it.

In GEANT4, the total cross section is used to determine a mean-free-path lµ which
is used in turn to generate random transport distances between discrete scattering
events for a particle. In reality, where an ion is propagating through, for example, a
solid material, scattering is not a discrete process but is continuous. However, it is

a

a
a useful, and highly accurate, simpliﬁcation to reduce such scattering to a series of
discrete events, by deﬁning some minimum energy transfer of interest, and setting
the mean free path to be the path over which statistically one such minimal transfer
has occurred. This approach is identical to the approach developed for the original
TRIM code [1]. As long as the minimal interesting energy transfer is set small
enough that the cumulative effect of all transfers smaller than that is negligible,
the approximation is valid. As long as the impact parameter selection is adjusted
to be consistent with the selected value of lµ, the physical result isn’t particularly
sensitive to the value chosen. One of the sets of validation tests discussed below
will verify the truth of this hypothesis, and will determine what reasonable values
for this minimal energy transfer are.

Noting, then, that the actual physical result isn’t very sensitive to the selection of
lµ, one can be relatively free about deﬁning the cross section s 0 from which lµ
is computed. The choice used for this implementation is fairly simple. Deﬁne a
physical cutoff energy Emin which is the smallest energy transfer to be included in
the calculation. Then, for a given incident particle with nuclear charge Z1 and mass
m1, and a target atom with nuclear charge Z2 and mass m2, compute the scattering
angle q c which will transfer this much energy to the target from the solution of

Erec = Einc

4 m1 m2
(m1 + m2)2 sin2

q c
2

and then solve, by iterative inversion of eq. (6), the value of the impact parameter
b at which this value of q c is achieved. Then, deﬁne the total cross section to be
s 0 = p b2, the area of the disk inside of which the passage of an ion will cause
at least the minimum interesting energy transfer. Because this process is relatively
expensive, and the result is needed extremely frequently, the values of s 0(Eincident)
are precomputed for each pairing of incident ion and target atom, and the results
cached. However, since the actual result isn’t very critical, the cached results can
be stored in a very coarsely sampled table without degrading the calculation at all,
as long as the values of the lµ used in the impact parameter selection are rigorously
consistent with this table.

The ﬁnal necessary piece of the scattering integral calculation is the statistical se-
lection of the impact parameter b to be used in each scattering event. This selection
is done following the original algorithm from TRIM, where the cumulative proba-
bility distribution for impact parameters is

This choice of sampling function does have the one peculiarity that it can produce
values of the impact parameter which are larger than the impact parameter which
results in the cutoff energy transfer, as discussed above in the section on the total
cross section, with probability 1/e. When this occurs, the scattering event is not
processed further, since the energy transfer is below threshold. For this reason,
impact parameter selection is carried out very early in the algorithm, so the effort
spent on uninteresting events is minimized.

The above choice of impact sampling is modiﬁed when the mean-free-path is very
short. If s 0 > p

This takes into account that impact parameters larger than half the lattice spacing
do not occur, since then one is closer to the adjacent atom. This also derives from
TRIM.

One extra feature is included in our model, to accelerate the production of rel-
atively rare events such as high-angle scattering. This feature is a cross-section
scaling algorithm, which allows the user access to an unphysical control of the
algorithm which arbitrarily scales the cross-sections for a selected fraction of in-
teractions. This is implemented as a two-parameter adjustment to the central algo-
rithm. The ﬁrst parameter is a selection frequency fh which sets what fraction of
the interactions will be modiﬁed. The second parameter is the scaling factor for
the cross-section. This is implemented by, for a fraction fh of interactions, scaling
the impact parameter by b′ = b/√scale. This feature, if used with care so that it
does not provide excess multiple-scattering, can provide between 10 and 100-fold
improvements to event rates. If used without checking the validity by comparing to
un-adjusted scattering computations, it can also provide utter nonsense. This scal-
ing provides a mechanism to address the issues discussed in the recent literature
[9,10]. In particular, it solves the problem of preserving multiple scattering effects
by leaving most interactions unaffected (if the fraction fh is much less than unity)
while still providing signiﬁcantly enhanced yields of hard collisions.

3 Validation

There are a number of features of this model which need to be veriﬁed against
good physical data and theoretical expectations, within the GEANT4 framework, to
assure the compatibility of its statistical sampling methods with those of GEANT4,
the correctness of the underlying physical assumptions, and the freedom of the
implemented code from logic defects.

In many of the comparisons below, we use data from SRIM as the reference. This
choice was made because of the wide acceptance of SRIM in many ﬁelds as a use-
ful and well-tested tool. Furthermore, the large compendium of measurements ref-
erenced at [3] provides a central repository for such information. However, precise
agreement with SRIM is not the goal of these comparisons. The method we de-
scribe should be more accurate than the nuclear scattering component of SRIM, in
that it exactly integrates the scattering, rather than using a universal, parameterized
approximation to it. Further, this method can be applied with speciﬁc internuclear
potentials, allowing further enhancement in accuracy over SRIM. However, since
electronic stopping contributes to all the processes discussed below, and SRIM is
highly optimized for this, especially in compound materials, it will most likely pro-
vide different, and probably better, results in some domains.

In the results below, the smooth curves listed as SRIM data are digitized from the
curves on the graphs provided on the SRIM website as of May, 2004. The digi-
tized data was oversampled, and then smoothed via least-squares cubic splining. If
a reader of this work intends to digitize data from our graphs, it is highly recom-
mended that the SRIM data be obtained from the original, and not re-digitized from
our copy, to prevent accumulation of errors.

Rutherford Scattering

The ﬁrst, and most basic, test is to see if the code replicates well-known scattering
distributions. It is important to note that, for this method, the Rutherford cross-
section is not a special case, insofar as the integrand in eq.(2) does not reduce to
an unusually simple form under our selected change-of-variable. Thus, agreement
with the expectations of Rutherford scattering, under conditions where this cross-
section is accurate, is a strong test of validity. To make this comparison, a very
typical set of scattering parameters was chosen, which is the scattering of 2 MeV
a particles from a 100 nm thick silicon foil. The results shown in Figure 1 were
computed both for the unmodiﬁed cross-section, and for a cross-section increased
by a factor of 100, as described above. The excellent agreement between the two
results indicates that the scaling process is not distorting the calculation. The scaled
cross section is used in the ﬁnal statistical comparison, since the total number of

7

events is much larger, resulting in better statistics. In the case of this calculation,
where the scattering probability from such a thin target is very small for almost
all scattering angles greater than 10 degrees, and multiple scattering provides no
signiﬁcant contribution, this agreement, even with a large cross-section scaling,
is expected. Note that the calculation has been cut off for small scattering angles,
where deviations from the Rutherford cross-section arise and where this assumption
about multiple scattering is not valid. Other validation tests will cover this region.

Figure 1. This compares the backscattering of 2 MeV a particles from a 100 nm Si foil to
the theoretical value. A total of 108 particles were used, with a cross-section enhancement
of 100, to get these statistics. The data are binned in cos q bins with d cos q = 0.02. The
points are plotted at the bin center, transformed to an angle. Computing time on a modern
laptop computer is a few hours.

Ion Implantation and Range Straggling

To test the process described here for accuracy in ﬁnal stopping situations, we will
compare with two very well documented systems: the propagation of a particles in
air, which has been studied since 1913 (see, e.g., [11] and an extensive bibliogra-
phy at [3]), and the implantation of dopants in silicon, which has been thoroughly
studied because of its importance to the semiconductor industry. The two cases for

8

implantation also cover two very different regions of parameter space. The implan-
tation of boron in silicon involves a light projectile on a heavy target, where some
high-angle scattering events can occur. Conversely, for arsenic in silicon, where the
projectile is much heavier than the target, all scattering is very forward. Also, the
arsenic-in-silicon test case samples data down to extremely low velocity.

Figure 2. Alpha particle range in air. Even at the lowest energies for which data are avail-
able, this process is dominated by electronic stopping. Thus, the differences which errors
in our calculation would introduce here are quite small.

Forward Multiple Scattering

The ability of this process to correctly produce small-angle forward scattering is
likely to be quite important. Typically, one is interested in the diffusion of an in-
coming beam particle as it is transported through, for example, a gas cell or metal
vacuum window. Although GEANT4 includes its own multiple scattering process
to approximate this, that process is optimized for efﬁciency with very high energy
ions, and for cases in which such scattering is quite weak.

Since the authors of this work have previous experience with and interest in scat-
tering of 270 keV a particles for surface analysis, we chose a test case from this
domain. The data presented in Figure 5 show the results. On two of the curves,
representative raw data from the Monte-Carlo simulation are shown, to illustrate

typical counting statistics for the data from which these curves are computed. The
actual smooth curves are least-squares cubic splines of the data.

The effect of the low-energy cutoff of this process is apparent at very small angles,
where scattering is suppressed below about 0.02 radians. This should be considered
as a warning to users of this process, in that one must consider carefully what
scattering angles are of interest. Choosing the cutoff energy too high will result in
distortion of the scattering distribution for small angles, but can result in improved
computational speed. In the case of this foil, the mean-free-path is about 30% of the
foil thickness for the 10 eV cutoff, and about 5% of the foil thickness for the 1 eV
cutoff. It is likely that this is a good way to estimate an appropriate cutoff energy,
since good multiple scattering accuracy depends upon at least a few interactions
being applied to each ion passing through the target. With the cutoff at 10 eV, for
this foil thickness, one is primarily sampling ions which have not undergone many
scatterings in the foil, so the distribution is somewhat too narrow. By the time the
cutoff has been reduced to 1 eV, each ion is scattered about 20 times in the foil, and
the resulting statistics can be expected to be quite accurate.

The curve labeled ’Quasi-analytic’ is computed using the method of [12], adapted

10

Figure 4. Arsenic range and straggling in silicon. At the relatively low velocities associated
with the kinetic energy range covered by this data set, nuclear scattering is strong, so the
straggling is a large fraction of the projected range and the process described in this work
is extremely important.

for the case where the energy of the beam exiting the target is very different from
the initial energy. This technique is a small-angle approximation to the multiple
scattering, but it uses high-accuracy scattering cross-sections computed directly
from the screening functions.

The curve labeled ’Geant4 MSC’ uses the G4MultipleScattering (MSC) process
which is a standard part of the GEANT4 package. This process uses a statistical
approach to multiple scattering [13], somewhat similar to that of [12], but which
is based on universal, parameterized scattering cross sections. As can be seen from
the graph, it severely underestimates high-angle scattering for heavy ions. More
signiﬁcant, and one of the primary reasons for this work, is that it does not produce
recoil particles.

Figure 6 shows another forward multiple-scattering case, with two important differ-
ences from that in Figure 5. First, the intrinsic GEANT4 multiple scattering works
quite well for computing the width of the forward scattering distribution for pro-
tons. Note that, even for this case, it shows a deﬁcit of almost a factor of two for
higher-angle scattering. Second, another parameter of the the screened Coulomb
model is exercised in this run.

In the discussion above, the mean free path was adjusted to be substantially less
than the target thickness by adjusting the lower cutoff energy of the data tables
being built. In the case of protons at this energy, even with a 1 eV cutoff energy,
the mean free path is too long to get good results. Lowering the physics cutoff
below 1 eV is probably unphysical, since the potentials aren’t well known far into
the tails, and solid state effects probably make them meaningless. However, the
real problem with the long mean free path is not that any physics is missing; it is
that many particles get through with 0 scattering events, since the mean number of
events is only a few.

The model contains a parameter MFPScale which allows the user to artiﬁcially
shorten the mean free path in a consistent manner, so that more attempts are made
to scatter and the Poisson statistics don’t overlap 0 events very strongly. This al-
lows the user to adjust the model for the case of very thin foils. The curve labeled
’MFP/10’ has had the mean free path reduced a factor of 10, and this fully resolves
(at the expense of increased computing time) the shape of the scattering distribution
near the origin.

The algorithm presented here provides an accurate and efﬁcient way to include the
effects of Coulomb scattering and the generation of recoil particles in GEANT4
simulations. This algorithm has the ﬂexibility to permit the user to select screen-
ing functions appropriate for speciﬁc applications, and to provide new screening
functions, without any rewriting of the core code. It should ﬁnd wide applicability
in many problems in the interaction of fast ions with materials, where the average
multiple-scattering already provided by GEANT4 must be replaced by a detailed
model.

Some improvements may be possible in the future, with appropriate checks for
physical validity. It is the belief of the authors that the weighting of the target atom
selection could be improved with extra material information. In a material in which
atoms live in very different environments, weighting the selection by the mean-
square bond length for each speciﬁc species may improve the statistical selection
accuracy. This would provide some compensation for an atom being closely caged
by its neighbors, such that it is hard to hit that atom without also making a close pass
to other species. Such weighting would have to be implemented by providing extra
information for the target material, beyond that which GEANT4 normally uses. A
mechanism for this already exists in GEANT4.

13

Although the current implementation of the algorithm is strictly non-relativistic,
the authors are investigating simple extensions which will correctly handle small-
angle collisions for relativistic incident particles and non-relativistic recoils. These
collisions are important for nuclear stopping power and Non-Ionizing Energy Loss
(NIEL) calculations at high energies. Hard collisions at relativistic energies are not
to be included, since such collisions have a small Coulombic cross-section and will
be combined hadronic-Coulombic events, in which case the screening function and
classical scattering concepts are not valid, and the resulting processes are handled
by nuclear-reaction codes.

core physics team, especially Maria Grazia Pia and Hans-Peter Wellisch, for helpful
discussions.

1 Appendix: Derivation of Integration Constants

The coefﬁcients for the summation to approximate the integral for a
in eq.(4) are
derived from the values in Abramowitz & Stegun [14, sec. 25.4.32 and table 25.6],
altered to make the change-of-variable used for this integral. There are two basic
steps to the transformation. First, since the provided abscissas xi and weights wi are
for integration on [-1,1], with only one half of the values provided, and in this work
the integration is being carried out on [0,1], the abscissas are transformed as:

2 APPENDIX: GEANT4 Implementation

The process being described in this work is a process of class G4DiscreteProcess in
the GEANT4 class hierarchy. As such, it really only needs to provide a few functions
to interact correctly with the GEANT4 world. The functions used by GEANT4 are
the constructor, GetMeanFreePath(), and PostStepDoIt(). Internally, the functions
are divided into two classes, a private CrossSection class which handles loading
of screening tables and total cross-section tables, and the main ScreenedNuclear-
Recoil class, which implements the required G4DiscreteProcess interface. There
are a few other utilities provided which allow such functions as adjusting various
model cutoffs, cross-section biasing, and control of energy deposition. The com-
putation and caching of screening functions and total cross-sections is left to an
external PYTHON [15] program.

Class CrossSection

This is a class derived from G4CrossSectionHandler, and provides extensions to
that class to read data in via a pipe from an external process, and to store screening
tables along with cross section tables.

Method: LoadData( G4String screeningKey, G4int z1, G4double m1, G4double re-
coilCutoff)

This method is the primary reason for the existence of this class. The standard G4-
CrossSectionHandler class is designed to read precomputed cross sections from
stored text ﬁles in a ﬁxed format. For the purposes of this system, it is not only
necessary to have cross sections, but screening tables, and these tables depend on
the value of the minimum scattering energy cutoff, as described above. The num-
ber of available parameters would result in a combinatorially large number of ﬁles
being required in the database. To avoid this problem, the author decided that it
was more efﬁcient to use a small, external program, written in the PYTHON pro-
gramming language, to dynamically generate the ﬁles as needed and to maintain a
cache of the tables actually used for quick re-use. This permits the user to include
custom screening functions by adding them to a small, easily maintained PYTHON
module. This module returns data to the main program through a UNIX-style pipe
interface, which is supported on all POSIX-compatible platforms, and appears as a
ﬁle to both the calling and called program.

Method: SelectRandomTargetUnweighted()

This method selects an atom from the currently active material, based only on the
stoichiometry of the material. Weighting the selection by the scattering cross sec-
tion would result in double-counting the weight, so it is not done.

Class ScreenedNuclearRecoil

The methods documented below are the public methods of the class which are
directly useful to the end user for setting physics parameters. The main PostStep-
DoIt() method implements the algorithm described in the rest of the paper, and is
only used by GEANT4 internals.

Method: ScreenedNuclearRecoil( const G4String& processName = "ScreenedElastic",
const G4String &ScreeningKey = "zbl", G4bool GenerateRecoils = 1, G4double
RecoilCutoff = 100.0*eV, G4double PhysicsCutoff = 10.0*eV)

The constructor for this process allows the user to set a number of important physics
parameters.

ScreeningKey selects which screening function will be requested from the exter-

nal PYTHON module which generates screening tables and cross sections

GenerateRecoils controls whether recoil particles are generated and tracked, or
whether a local energy deposition is made with the energy that would otherwise
have been transferred to a recoil particle.

RecoilCutoff sets the energy below which a recoil will not be generated, and be-
low which an incoming particle will be stopped with no further interaction.
PhysicsCutoff sets the energy cutoff used in the calculation of the total scattering
cross-section, as described above. Its value is typically set to between 1 eV and
10 eV for problems in which forward multiple scattering is important. For prob-
lems involving backscattering, it can be raised to 100 eV or beyond to improve
efﬁciency. Changing this parameter changes the mean-free-path and should not
have a strong effect, unless the mean-free-path is approaching the length scale of
the material in which the particle is traveling.

Method: AllowEnergyDeposition( G4bool ﬂag)

If this is called with a ﬂag of zero or false, all calls to deposit local energy are sup-
pressed, but all processes proceed normally otherwise. This is useful for measuring
how much energy is deposited as a result of nuclear collisions. Note that this leaves
the rest of the physics and random number consumption strictly alone, so that by
resetting the random number generation, one can run exactly the same events with

16

this on and off, and subtract the results to see how much energy was deposited in
ﬁnal stopping of particles when they reach the RECOILCUTOFF energy described
above.

Method: EnableRecoils( G4bool ﬂag)

This dynamically controls the same variable set by GENERATERECOILS in the
constructor. The value can be changed at any time.

Method: SetMFPScaling( G4double scale)

This allows the mean-free-path computed from lµ = 1/Ns 0 to be scaled by an ar-
bitrary amount, in a consistent way so that the underlying physics isn’t changed. It
is intended to improve tracking of particles in thin foils, where the thickness of the
foil is less than a few times the mean-free-path. It can be changed at any time (e.g.
one could add to a stepping action code to change it in a thin foil, and then reset it
for better efﬁciency in regions with longer scale lengths).

Method: SetRecoilCutoff( G4double energy)

This dynamically controls the same variable set by RECOILCUTOFF in the con-
structor, and can be changed at any time.

Method: SetPhysicsCutoff(G4double energy)

This dynamically controls the same variable set by PHYSICSCUTOFF in the con-
structor. Although it can be changed at any time, there is a relatively high cost
associated with doing so, since the physics tables for this process must then be
reloaded. It is intended to allow the user to change it between runs, without restart-
ing the GEANT4 kernel.

Method: SetCrossSectionHardening(G4double fraction, G4double HardeningFac-
tor)

This enables the cross-section enhancement algorithm described above. A subset
of the interactions, with probability FRACTION, has its cross-section increased by
a scale of HARDENINGFACTOR by reducing the impact parameter appropriately. It
can be changed at any time.

Method: G4double GetNIEL()

This returns the total energy which has been deposited as local energy depositions
by this process in the most recent step. It is reset at the start of each step, so it must
be accessed in the UserSteppingAction or in a subclass which overriddes PostStep-
DoIt() if its value is of interest. It is assumed to represent the Non-Ionizing Energy
Loss (NIEL) if the RECOILCUTOFF is set low enough that essentially all of the
remaining energy in a particle will be deposited collisionally. This value is valid
whether ALLOWENERGYDEPOSITION is true or false.

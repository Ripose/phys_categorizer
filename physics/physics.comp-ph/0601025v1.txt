ABSTRACT

Miniaturized optical resonators with spatial dimensions of the order of the wavelength of the trapped light
oﬀer prospects for a variety of new applications like quantum processing or construction of meta-materials.
Light propagation in these structures is modelled by Maxwell’s equations. For a deeper numerical analysis one
may compute the scattered ﬁeld when the structure is illuminated or one may compute the resonances of the
structure. We therefore address in this paper the electromagnetic scattering problem as well as the computation
of resonances in an open system. For the simulation eﬃcient and reliable numerical methods are required which
cope with the inﬁnite domain. We use transparent boundary conditions based on the Perfectly Matched Layer
Method (PML) combined with a novel adaptive strategy to determine optimal discretization parameters like the
thickness of the sponge layer or the mesh width. Further a novel iterative solver for time-harmonic Maxwell’s
equations is presented.

1. INTRODUCTION

With the advances in nanostructure physics it has become possible to construct light resonators on a lengthscale
equal to or even smaller than optical wavelengths.1, 2 These nanostructures are large on the atomic scale,
therefore they can be of complex geometry and they may possess properties not occuring in nature, like an
eﬀective negative index of refraction3 which allows in principle to overcome limits in the resolution of optical
imaging systems.4

The numerical simulation of light ﬁelds in such structures is a ﬁeld of ongoing research. In this paper we
report on ﬁnite element methods for the eﬃcient computation of resonances and light propagation in arbitrarily
shaped structures embedded in simply structured, inﬁnite domains. Section 2 introduces our concept of discretiz-
ing exterior inﬁnite domains. Section 3 recapitulates a formulation of Maxwell’s equations for time-harmonic
scattering problems. Section 4 introduces an adaptive method for the eﬃcient discretization of the exterior
domain based on the PML method introduced by Berenger.5 Section 5 shows the weak formulation of Maxwell’s
equations which is needed for the ﬁnite-element method. In Section 6 we shortly introduce a new preconditioner
for the numerical solution of indeﬁnite time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations. Finally, in Sections 8 and 9 we test
our algorithms on nano-optical real world problems: the computation of resonances and scattering in arrays of
split-ring resonators and in isolated pyramidal nano-resonators.

Figure 1. Inﬁnite domain. The interior domain (left) may contain nearby arbitrarily shaped objects. The exterior
domain consists of prisms attached to triangular boundary faces of the interior domain. Each prism is the image of the
unit prism (right) under a bilinear mapping such that the triangles with ξ = const are mapped to parallel triangles. For
each inﬁnite prism we assume constant material parameters.

2. GEOMETRIC CONFIGURATION

In this section we explain how to specify an inﬁnite geometry such that it ﬁts well to the ﬁnite element method
(FEM). The geometry is split into a bounded interior domain Ωint and an unbounded exterior domain Ωext. The
interior domain may contain nearby arbitrary shaped structures such as spheres or thin layers. The geometry
in the exterior domain is more restricted. However, the construction we propose is general enough to deal with
typical geometries of optical devices.

We assume that the boundary Γ of the interior domain consists of triangles. A boundary triangle F

that each triangle Tρ =
is mapped onto a triangle parallel to the face and such that
the bottom triangle of the unit patch is mapped onto the corresponding face, QF T0 = F, cf. Figure 1. The
image of QF is denoted by PF . Hence we attach the inﬁnite prism PF to the transparent face F. It must hold
true that Ωext =

that is F and F ′ have a common point, then QF (η1, η2, ξ) = QF ′(η′

are L∞ functions of the spatial variable ~x = (x1, x2, x3). In addition we assume that the tensors ε and µ are
constant on each inﬁnite prism as deﬁned in the previous section. For simplicity assume that the dielectric and
the permeability tensors are isotropic so they may be treated as scalar valued functions. Recall that any solution
to (1a) with ω

A scattering problem may be deﬁned as follows: Given an incoming electric ﬁeld Einc satisfying the time-
harmonic Maxwell’s equations (1) for a ﬁxed angular frequency ω in the exterior domain, compute the total
Einc deﬁned on Ωext is

4. ADAPTIVE PML METHOD

The perfectly matched layer method was originally introduced by Berenger in 1994.5 The idea is to discretize
a complex continued ﬁeld in the exterior domain which decays exponentially fast with growing distance to the
interior-exterior domain coupling boundary. This way a truncation of the exterior domain only results in small
artiﬁcial reﬂections. The exponential convergence of the method with growing thickness of the sponge layer was
proven for homogeneous exterior domains by Lassas and Somersalo.7, 8 An alternative proof with a generalization
to a certain type of inhomogeneous exterior domain is given by Hohage et al.9 Nevertheless as shown in our
paper10 the PML method intrinsically fails for certain types of exterior domains such as layered media. This
is due to a possible total reﬂection at material interfaces. In this case there exists a critical angle of incidence
for which the resulting ﬁeld in the exterior domain is neither propagating nor evanescent. Here we show that
it is possible to overcome these diﬃculties when using an adaptive method for the discretization of the exterior
domain problem. We assume the following expansion of the scattered ﬁeld in the exterior domain

0 and a bounded function c(η1, η2, α). Hence Esc is a superposition of outgoing or
with
evanescent waves in ξ direction. In our notation we have assumed that there exists a global (η1, η2, ξ)-coordinate
system for the exterior domain. But in the following only the global meaning of the ξ coordinate as explained
in Section 2 will be used, so η1 and η2 may also be considered as coordinates of a local chart for a subdomain of

As can be seen from Equation (5) the PML method only eﬀects the outgoing part with

kξ strictly larger
than zero. Field contributions with an large
kξ component are eﬃciently damped out. Furthermore evanescent
ﬁeld contributions are damped out independently of the complex continuation. For a proper approximation of
the oscillatory and exponential behavior a discretization that is ﬁne enough is needed to resolve the ﬁeld. In
contrast to that anomalous modes or “near anomalous” modes with kξ
0 enforce the usage of a large ρ but
can be well approximated with a relatively coarse discretization in ξ. Such “near anomalous” modes typically
occur in the periodic setting but may also be present for isolated structures with a layered exterior domain.11
Hence for an eﬃcient numerical approximation of the scattered ﬁeld one must use an adaptive discretization.
It is useful to think of the complex continuation as a high-frequency ﬁlter. With a growing distance ξ to the
interior coupling boundary the higher frequency contributions are damped out so that the discretization can be
coarsened.

the lower frequency parts with κ
per (generalized) wavelength 2π/κ we get the following formula for the a priori determination of the local mesh
width h(ξ) = 2πσ/κco,ǫ(ξ)/Np.w. Since κco,ǫ(ξ)

for ξ
reasonable to use a ﬁner discretization in the exterior domain than in the interior domain we bound the local
mesh width by the minimum mesh width hint of the interior domain discretization on the coupling boundary,

To demonstrate the performance of the adaptive PML algorithm we compute the reﬂection of a plane wave
direction we use Bloch periodic boundary conditions.12 We vary
at a material interface, cf. Figure 2. In x1−
the angle of incidence from ϑ = 20◦ to ϑ = 60◦. Further the incoming ﬁeld is rotated along the x3 axis by an
angle of 45◦, so that the incidence is twofold oblique (conical). Hence the unit direction of the incoming ﬁeld is
equal to ˆk = (cos 45◦ sin ϑ, cos ϑ, sin 45◦ sin ϑ). We use an interior domain of size 1.5
1 in wavelength scales. To
measure the error we compute the ﬁeld energy within the interior domain and compare it to the analytic value.
In Figure 3 the error is plotted for diﬀerent reﬁnement levels of the interior domain. The “+” line corresponds
to the ﬁnest level. In Figure 4 the automatically adapted thickness of the PML is plotted (left) and the number
of discretization points N in ξ direction (right). As expected a huge layer is constructed automatically at the
critical angle, whereas the total number of discretization points remains moderate. As can be seen in Figure 3

the maximum error appears at the critical angle. From that one may suspect a failure of the automatic PML
adaption. But a closer analysis reveals that the chosen discretization in the PML layer is suﬃcient as can be seen
from Table 1. Here the thickness of the perfectly matched layer has been ﬁxed and we further reﬁned the interior
domain. By this means we observe convergence to the true solution but the convergence rate is halved at the
critical angle. Hence the maximum error at the critical angle is caused by an insuﬃcient interior discretization.
We conjecture that this is due to a dispersion eﬀect. Since near the critical angle the wave Eout is traveling
mainly along the x1−

direction it reenters the periodic domain, leading to large “path length”.

derived in the last section. Since ω2 > 0 this system is indeﬁnite. Hence standard multigrid methods will suﬀer
from slow convergence rates or may even not converge. Other numerical methods like the Finite Diﬀerence
Time Domain method do not start from the time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations. Instead they simulate temporal
transient eﬀects. For practical purposes the computation time is prohibitively large until the steady state is
reached.15 Even worse, the usage of an explicite time stepping scheme forces the usage of very small time steps
to avoid instabilities.

Here we propose a preconditioner for the time-harmonic system which makes use of the fact that the solution
we want to compute is the steady state solution to a transient process. This is the reason why we call this
preconditioner “time domain” preconditioner. Instead of using time dependent Maxwell’s equations one may use
another dynamical system whose steady state solution is the ﬁeld in mind. For example the above solution u is

u0, p−1u1, p−2u2,
converges to the solution u of Equation (6) indepently of the selected time step τ. In our
{
code we typically ﬁx τ = 0.1/ω2. Starting from a randomized initial guess u0 we compute a ﬁxed number N of
iterations to the recursion formula (7) which yields the sequence
. In each iteration step
the arising system is solved by an multigrid method up to a moderate accuracy. We then compute the minimum
residual solution within the space spanned by the last M < N vectors in this sequence. The so constructed
approximate solver is used as a preconditioner for a standard iterative method for indeﬁnite problems such as
GMRES or BCGSTAB.16

Other discrete schemes may be used to improve the convergence to the steady state solution. For example
it is promising to use schemes stemming from higher order Runge-Kutta methods or multi-step methods for the
discretization of the original wave equation or the Schr¨odinger like equation above.

Hence a resonance mode may exponentially grow with the generalized distance ξ. In this case we must choose σ
large enough in the PML method to achieve an exponential damping of the complex continued solution. Using

Split-ring resonators (SRR’s) can be understood as small LC circuits consisting of an inductance L and a
capacitance C. The circuit can be driven by applying external electromagnetic ﬁelds. Near the resonance
frequency of the LC
oscillator the induced current can lead to a magnetic ﬁeld opposing the external magnetic
ﬁeld. When the SRR’s are small enough and closely packed – such that the system can be described as an
eﬀective medium – the induced opposing magnetic ﬁeld corresponds to an eﬀective negative permeability, µ < 0,
of the medium.

Arrays of gold SRR’s with resonances in the NIR and in the optical regime can be experimentally realized using
electron-beam lithography, where typical dimensions are one order of magnitude smaller than NIR wavelengths.
Details on the production can be found in Linden and Enkrich.1, 2

Due to the small dimensions of the LC circuits their resonances are in the NIR and optical regime.2 Fig-
ure 5(a) shows the tetrahedral discretization of the interior domain of the geometry. Figure 5(b) shows results
from FEM simulations of light scattering oﬀ a periodic array of SRR’s for diﬀerent angles of the incident light.17
At λ
1.5µm the transmission is strongly reduced due to the excitation of a resonance of the array of SRR’s.
This excitation occurs for all investigated angles of incidence.

When one is interested to learn about resonances, obviously it is rather indirect and time-consuming to
calculate the scattering response of some incident light ﬁeld and then to conclude the properties of the resonance.
We have therefore also directly computed resonances of SRR’s by solving Eqn. (8). Special care has to be taken
in constructing appropriate PML layers, as in this case the previously described adaptive strategy for the PML is
more involved. We have therefore set these parameters by hand. We have computed the fundamental resonance
with ω = 1.302023

Figure 6. Pyramidal nano resonator. The structure in mounted on a Gallium Arsenid (GaAs) substrate. The middle
ﬁgure shows the ﬁeld amplitude in the x-z plane. The right ﬁgure shows the ﬁeld amplitude in the y-z plane. (See original
publication for images with higher resolution.)

9. PYRAMIDAL NANO-RESONATOR

This type of nano resonators is proposed to be used as optical element in quantum information processing.18
The structure is as depicted in Figure 6 (left). We have simulated the illumination of the structure with a
plane wave of a vacuum wavelength λ0 = 1.55µm and a unit direction ˆk = (√0.5, 0,
√0.5). The incident ﬁeld
was polarized in x-direction. Figure 6 shows the ﬁeld amplitude in the computational domain. More than ﬁve
million of unknowns were used in the discretization. With the preoconditioner proposed in Section 6 (N=20) the
GMRES method exhibited a convergence rate of 0.8.

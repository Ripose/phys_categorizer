Recently it has been found that stable and accurate molec-
ular dynamics (MD) of B-DNA duplexes can be obtained in
relatively inexpensive computational conditions with the bulk
solvent represented implicitly, but the minor groove ﬁlled with
explicit water (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 10928). The
present paper further explores these simulation conditions in
order to understand the main factors responsible for the ob-
served surprisingly good agreement with experimental data.
It appears that in the case of the EcoRI dodecamer certain
sequence speciﬁc hydration patterns in the minor groove ear-
lier known from experimental data are formed spontaneously
in the course of MD simulations. The eﬀect is reliably re-
produced in several independent computational experiments
in diﬀerent simulation conditions. With all major groove wa-
ter removed, closely similar results are obtained, with even
better reproducibility. On the other hand, without explicit
hydration, metastable dynamics around a B-DNA like state
can be obtained which, however, only poorly compares with
experimental data. It appears, therefore, that a right-handed
DNA helix with explicitly hydrated minor groove is a min-
imal model system where the experimental properties of B-
DNA can be reproduced with non-trivial sequence-dependent
eﬀects. Its small size makes possible virtually exhaustive sam-
pling, which is a major advantage with respect to alternative
approaches. An appendix is included with a correction to the
implicit leapfrog integrator used in internal coordinate MD.

I. INTRODUCTION

Understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms
of conformational dynamics of the double helical DNA is
an important goal on the long way to control of genom
functions. Computer simulations are the main theoretical
instrument in such studies. An important recent progress
in the methodology1,2,3 has made possible molecular dy-
namics (MD) simulations of short DNA fragments in re-
alistic water environment with explicit counterions (com-
prehensive surveys of the literature can be found in the
recent reviews4,5).
In should be noted, however, that
although in future these methods will probably be able
to describe in full detail all interactions involved in the
numerous biological functions of DNA, at present their
capabilities are very limited. There are many important
domains where they can hardly be applied, in the fore-
seeable future, for instance, dynamics of long linear DNA
fragments or plasmids. Even for small oligomers these
methods require supercomputer resources because the so-

lute molecule must be placed in a large enough water
box to accommodate all neutralizing counterions with-
out exceeding reasonable levels of eﬀective DNA and salt
concentrations. This makes any methodological ques-
tions diﬃcult, especially those concerning statistical re-
producibility of results because, until now, almost all re-
ports on the subject described observations made for sin-
gle trajectories.

The foregoing arguments explain why it is necessary
to ﬁnd alternative conditions for MD simulations of B-
DNA which would be less computationally demanding,
but yet acceptably accurate. The utility of such DNA
model would be twofold. On the one hand, it can give
a unique opportunity to probe the properties of large
systems of real biological importance where more rigor-
ous approaches would be prohibitively expensive. On
the other hand, for smaller molecules they can provide
for an exhaustive sampling of the conﬁgurational space,
which is a necessary prerequisite of a more systematic
studies of detailed mechanisms involved in the confor-
mational dynamics of double helical DNA. We have re-
cently found that surprisingly stable dynamics of B-DNA
duplexes can be obtained with semi-explicit treatment
of long-range electrostatics eﬀects.6 Paradoxically, it ap-
peared that this simplistic approach results in B-DNA
conformations that are signiﬁcantly closer to experimen-
tal data than ever before, including the recent more rig-
orous and expensive calculations. This relative success
raised several intriguing questions concerning its origin.
On the one hand, a better agreement with experimental
data can always result from a fortunate cancelation of
errors. On the other hand, it is possible that the ear-
lier reported a priori more rigorous calculations failed
to reveal the full accuracy of the recent atom param-
eter sets, notably AMBER94,1 because of insuﬃcient
duration of trajectories or some problem in calculation
of long range electrostatic interactions by the particle-
mesh Ewald technique.3 Both these possibilities should
be checked, but the former is certainly easier to analyze
because this does not require expensive computations.

In this paper we address some of the above questions
by further exploring the dynamic behavior of B-DNA du-
plexes with partial explicit hydration shell. Our main
objective is to justify what we call a “minimal B-DNA”,
that is the least computationally demanding simulation
conditions where the essential experimental features of

itly hydrated minor groove, empty major groove, and
the electrostatic eﬀects of the bulk solvent accounted
for implicitly. We report also about relatively success-
ful attempts to obtain stable dynamics without explicit
hydration, which, however, give much worse agreement

minimal model reliably reproduces certain well-known se-
quence dependent eﬀects, notably, modulation of the mi-
nor groove width and spontaneous formation of speciﬁc
“spine” hydration pattern observed in many experimen-
tal structures. At the same time, for two very diﬀerent
sequences it converges to signiﬁcantly diﬀerent conforma-
tions which, however, are both close to the canonical B-
DNA form. These results appear relatively insensitive to
variations of parameters involved in the simpliﬁed treat-
ment of long-range electrostatic interactions.

II. METHODS AND SIMULATION PROTOCOLS

All new MD simulations reported here have been per-
formed with the internal coordinate molecular dynam-
ics (ICMD) method.7,8,9,10,11 Here we employ a mod-
iﬁed implicit leapfrog integrator detailed in the Ap-
pendix. We consider dynamics of two diﬀerent DNA
duplexes with sequences d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 and
d(GCGCGCGCGCGC)2. Most of the calculations were
made with the ﬁrst molecule often referred to in the lit-
erature as “EcoRI dodecamer”. The second dodecamer
is used for comparison. The EcoRI sequence was the ﬁrst
to crystallize in the B-form of DNA12 and since then it
became perhaps the most studied DNA fragment both
experimentally and theoretically.13,14,15,16,17,18,19 In the
recent years it has been often used in benchmark tests of
new force ﬁelds and algorithms.6,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29
The DNA model was same as in our recent report,6
namely, all torsions were free as well as bond angles
centered at sugar atoms, while other bonds and angles
were ﬁxed, and the bases held rigid. The dynamic prop-
erties of this model, notably, the fastest motions and
maximal possible time steps have already been studied.6
AMBER941 force ﬁeld and atom parameters were used
with TIP3P water30 and no cut oﬀ schemes.

The solvent eﬀects were taken into account by the
mixed strategy6 which we continue to explore and im-
prove here. In this method, following to a long known ap-
proximate approach,31,32,33 long range eﬀects are taken
into account implicitly by reducing phosphate charges
and using a linear distance dependent dielectric func-
tion ε = r. On the other hand, the minor groove of
the DNA molecule is ﬁlled up by explicit water with the
water cloud somewhat protruding in space. In the ini-
tial hydration procedure the DNA molecule is ﬁrst cov-
ered by a 5 ˚A thick water shell by placing it in a wa-
ter box and eliminating overlapping and distant solvent
molecules. To allow water molecules to penetrate into the

2

minor groove, rather small cut-oﬀ distances are used as
the overlap criteria, namely, 1.8 and 1.3 ˚A for oxygen and
hydrogen water atoms, respectively. After that cylinder-
like volumes around each strand are built from spheres
centered at phosphorus atoms with radii of 12 ˚A. All wa-
ter molecules that appear outside the intersection area
of the two volumes are removed. The solvent remaining
is next relaxed by energy minimization ﬁrst with the so-
lute held rigid and then with all degrees of freedom. This
procedure gives a partially hydrated duplex, with the mi-
nor groove completely ﬁlled and a few solvent molecules
in the major groove. In some calculations we addition-
ally cleaned the major grove from the remaining water
after the second minimization. The motivations for this
additional step are discussed in the text.

The standard heating and equilibration protocols have
been slightly modiﬁed compared with our previous stud-
ies. Dynamics was initiated with zero solvent tempera-
ture by giving the solute a kinetic energy corresponding
to 300 K. During the initial short 2 ps run the temper-
ature was weakly coupled to 250 K by the Berendsen
algorithm34 with a relaxation time of 1 ps. During the
next 5 ps the temperature coupling was switched oﬀ and
at the end of the whole 7 ps period the system temper-
ature normally reached 200 K. Starting from this state
the production trajectory was computed with the tem-
perature coupled to 300 K with a relaxation time of 10
ps. This algorithm provides for a softer start and helps
to reduce dissociation of hot water molecules during the
early non-equilibrated phases of dynamics.6 For trajecto-
ries starting from the canonical B-DNA form the energy
minimization was applied both before and after hydra-
tion. Hydration of the Xray structure12 was performed
with all crystallographic water molecules kept in their
places.

Normally we used time steps of 5 and 10 fs in heating
and production runs, respectively. The possibility and
the necessary conditions for this large time steps have
been discussed elsewhere.6,40,41 Duration of trajectories
varied depending upon speciﬁc conditions discussed in
the text. In calculations with the solvent shell a minimum
duration of 5 ns was usually suﬃcient to arrive at stable
levels of average helical parameters as well as rmsd’s from
the reference conformations. In production runs confor-
mations were saved with a 2.5 ps interval. Structures
from the last nanosecond were used for computing an
average conformation referred to as the ﬁnal MD state
of the corresponding trajectory. The reference canonical
A and B forms were constructed with NUCGEN utility
of AMBER39 or JUMNA program.33 Curves42 and “Di-
als and Windows” procedures43 were used for analysis
of DNA conformations. XmMol program44 was used for
visual inspection and animation of trajectories.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. General Outline of Simulations and Results

Tables I, II and Figs. 1 and 2 characterize in gen-
eral the numerical experiments and results considered in
detail in sections below. Table I summarizes variations
of computational protocols for diﬀerent trajectories. For
brevity each trajectory is referred to by using a single-
letter code with a preﬁx “TJ”. Trajectories from A to
K computed for the EcoRI dodecamer diﬀer either by
the starting state, or by the details in the application
of hydration procedures, or by the reduced phosphate
charge. TJA, TJB, and TJC have been the subject of
our previous report.6 They are discussed together with
the rest and are included in Table I for completeness. It
is worth reminding here that TJC was computed by us-
ing the conventional Cartesian coordinate MD method
starting from the same state as TJA. TJD and TJI also
started from the same conformation, namely, the Xray
structure,12 with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent initial distribu-
tion of water molecules obtained by varying parameters
of the hydration algorithm. TJE, TJF, and TJG were
computed in the dehydrated state of the duplex to clar-
ify the role of the explicit water and study the eﬀect
of phosphate screening. Similarly, TJH, TJI, TJJ, and
TJK were calculated for the same model system with
diﬀerent phosphate screening parameters. Finally, TJL
computed for another sequence checks the possibility of
observing sequence dependent structural eﬀects with this
DNA model.

Figure 1 presents the ﬁnal states of representative tra-
jectories in Table I together with the canonical B-form
and the Xray structure of the EcoRI dodecamer. The

drawings are the outputs of Curves program42 which also
computes the optimal helical axis shown by a continu-
ous roughly vertical line in each plate. Figure 2 shows
variations of the minor groove widths for the same struc-
tures computed by the spline algorithm implemented in
Curves.45 On the right of each structure in Fig. 1 the
rmsd from the canonical B-DNA is given. For EcoRI do-
decamer the second value shows the rmsd from the Xray
conformation. This structure is asymmetrical and, since
the sequence is palindromic, the rmsd can be computed
in two orientations. Both orientations were tried and
the lower rmsd values are given in Fig. 1.
It is seen
that the structures are generally close to the two exper-
imental B-DNA conformations, with a few exceptions to
be discussed hereafter. The majority of the computed
structures of the EcoRI dodecamer have a characteristic
proﬁle of the minor groove with a narrowing in the cen-
ter, which is a well-known feature of the experimental
crystallographic structure.46 These results conﬁrm our
initial report on these simulation conditions.6 Time de-
pendencies of rmsd’s are not analyzed here systemati-
cally. We note only that for trajectories with the ﬁnal
rmsd values below 2 ˚A they were qualitatively similar
to those reported for TJA, TJB and TJC. Namely, af-
ter the ﬁrst 100 ps the rmsd from the canonical B-form
and the Xray structure are usually found between 2.5
and 3.5 ˚A. In our earlier calculations6 this large initial
shift was either already present in the initial conforma-
tion or resulted from in vacuo energy minimization of
the canonical B-DNA form, but it also occurs in trajec-
tories starting from the Xray conformation. During the
ﬁrst two nanoseconds the rmsd values gradually decrease,
with the 2 ˚A level commonly passed within the second
nanosecond. The lowest rmsd values from experimen-
tal B-DNA conformations are usually reached within the

the level of ﬂuctuations in the nanosecond time scale.

Selected averaged helical parameters corresponding to
the structures in Fig. 1 are assembled in Table II. The
complete set of these parameters have been discussed for
TJA, TJB and TJC,6 and here we note only that parame-
ters not included in Table II do not show systematic devi-
ations from experimental values. In contrast, Xdisp and
inclination obtained in diﬀerent simulations for EcoRI se-
quence show a small but systematic deviation. Propeller
is generally well reproduced, and it is included in Table 1
because it plays an important structural role for AT-rich
sequences47 and is rather sensitive to simulation condi-
tions. Finally, twist and rise are the key helical parame-
ters responsible for the major part of rmsd’s. The time
variation of the helical parameters in the present B-DNA
model has already been characterized.6 It is similar to the
above described behavior of rmsd’s in the sense that it
usually takes about 3 ns for the main parameters to come
close to the standard B-DNA values. In all calculations
reported here the initial large rmsd’s are accompanied
by low average twist which usually raise from 32–33◦ to
34–35◦ during calculations.

The data presented in Figs. 1 and 2, and Tables I and

II are discussed in detail in sections below.

B. B-DNA Dynamics in the Dehydrated State

It is known since long ago that reasonably good duplex
DNA conformations can be obtained by minimization of
potential energy with implicit modeling of solvent eﬀects,
notably, by reducing phosphate charges and scaling of

4

Coulomb forces with a distance dependent electrostatic
function.48 On the other hand, it is also known that these
structures are not dynamically stable.16 The dehydrated
state presents non-negligible theoretical interest because
the “naked DNA” is the core of the whole system and un-
derstanding its mechanics is important for distinguishing
between the trends that originate from intra-duplex in-
teractions and water eﬀects. We brieﬂy report here about
a few interesting lessons that we have learned from ICMD
simulations of B-DNA in the dehydrated state.

We hoped initially that, due to the reduced ﬂexibil-
ity of the standard geometry DNA model, its structure
could be more stable than in the earlier Cartesian co-
ordinate MD simulations.
It was found, however, that
trajectories generally tend to be trapped in earlier de-
scribed deformed states characterized by a collapsed mi-
nor groove.16 Such transformations invariably start from
a phosphate BI → BII ﬂip, which can next result in a
signiﬁcant deformation of the standard B-DNA shape,
with partial local closing of the minor groove. This be-
havior seems to be an intrinsic defect of in vacuo condi-
tions. However, the probability of collapsing transitions
was high only during the ﬁrst nanosecond when, in an-
imation, the DNA molecule exhibited very violent pe-
riodical low frequency bending and stretching motions.
This intermediate phase is caused by the heating pro-
cedures that commonly last less then 10 ps and always
use some velocity scaling which, however, aﬀects only
normal modes that have non-zero instantaneous veloci-
ties. The slowest normal modes of a dodecamer B-DNA
fragment have periods beyond 10 ps,49 therefore, during
heating, those that happen to be in their fast phase are
strongly overheated. In vacuo the uneven distribution of
the kinetic energy is rather persistent and it apparently
takes hundreds of picoseconds to reach equipartition. In
many test calculations we observed that if the structure
managed to survive the ﬁrst nanosecond, it continued to
stay in a reasonably good B-DNA form for rather long
time so that its average dynamic properties could well be
characterized. BI → BII transitions still occur, but the
minor groove does not close immediately and many such
transitions appear reversible.

Trajectories TJE, TJF, and TJG in Table I have been
computed with special precautions that take into account
the foregoing qualitative features. Dynamics were initi-
ated with random velocities and during the ﬁrst nanosec-
ond the temperature was raised to 250 K by the Berend-
sen algorithm34 with a relaxation time of 100 ps. Calcu-
lations were next continued with the standard parame-
ters, that is with the bath temperature of 300 K and a
10 ps relaxation time. If a transition to a collapsed state
was observed the calculations were restarted from one of
the preceding conformations with random velocities at
300 K. Such restarts were repeated until a suﬃciently

case of TJF one restart was necessary to get a continu-
ous 5 ns trajectory. TJG was also stable during 5 ns after
one restart, but only the ﬁrst 2.9 ns were used for anal-

ysis because a few reversible BI → BII transitions that
happened in its second part caused non-negligible tem-
porary distortions. In contrast, in the case of TJG three
restarts were necessary to obtain a 2.7 ns continuous run
at the end of which the structure collapsed.

Figure 3 shows the time variations of rmsd from several
reference structure for TJF. As wee see, the in vacuo dy-
namics are qualitatively diﬀerent from that with explicit
hydration. Namely, the short-time rmsd ﬂuctuations are
similar or even larger, but the trajectory apparently sam-
ples from a broad energy valley around one and the same
state in which it appeared after equilibration. This sys-
tem has an essentially constant list of atom-atom con-
tacts. The local energy minima can occur due to com-
plex energy proﬁles of base stacking, but they seem to be
rather shallow and the trajectory passes above the barri-
ers so that no distinct conformational transitions within
the B-DNA family are observed. A few sharp peaks in
the traces in Fig. 3 correspond to short-living BI → BII
transitions. The rmsd between the structures averaged
over the ﬁve consecutive nanosecond intervals was as low
as 0.1 ˚A. The ﬁnal TJF state shown in Fig. 1 has rmsd
of only 0.5 ˚A from the initial minimum energy structure.
Thus, a naked B-DNA duplex presents a relatively
simple object with a single signiﬁcant energy minimum
which is rather broad. This state resembles the canoni-
cal B-DNA and is characterized by the rmsd’s of 3.1 and
4.5 ˚A, respectively, from B and A forms and some of its
helical parameters shown in Table II are also between
the canonical A and B-DNA values. The other two in
vacuo trajectories were very similar. This means, in par-
ticular, that the shorter durations of TJE and TJG are
quite suﬃcient for correct averaging. A visual analysis
of the ﬁnal TJF state superposed with the canonical B-
DNA shows that the relatively high rmsd value results
from the following main contributions: (i) lower nega-
tive Xdisp, (ii) much lower average twist, and (iii) small
but non-negligible bending of the helical axis towards the
center of the minor groove. The latter eﬀect is very clear
in superposition ﬁgures and it is nicely detected by the

between the ﬁnal states of these three in vacuo trajecto-
ries, which is discussed hereafter.

C. Negative Role of Water Films in Major Groove

The hydration procedure described above has been de-
signed to completely ﬁll up the minor groove of B-DNA
and also left in the major groove some small number of
water molecules to which we initially did not pay much
attention. The eﬀect of this water is not negligible, how-
ever. Figure 4 compares the time variations of rmsd from
reference conformations for TJD and TJI. In both cases
the initial state of was prepared by hydrating the crystal-
lographic structure which, because of the water crowd-
ing, has only slightly changed during energy minimiza-
tion (the rmsd 1.25 ˚A). In the crystal conformation, the
two opposite phosphate traces come close to each other
in the middle, which is usually described as narrowing of
the minor groove.46 For this speciﬁc shape our hydration
procedure left in the major groove a relatively large num-
ber of water molecules. The left two plates in Fig. 4 show
that, in dynamics, the structure slowly returns to the ini-
tial state after ﬁrst leaving it rapidly during heating. The
lower plate shows the time variation of the rmsd from the
crystal structure. Due to the symmetry of the sequence
the rmsd comparison can be made in two ways giving the
“proper” and “improper” rmsd values, the latter corre-
sponding to the opposite assignment of the two strands.
The crystal conformation itself is strongly asymmetric
and characterized by a large “improper” rmsd of 1.7 ˚A.
In dynamics, this initial asymmetry should relax, and the
same level must be reached by the two rmsd values after
an ultimate equilibration. Figure 4 shows that although

the TJD trace of the “proper” rmsd reaches very low val-
ues it is systematically shifted downward from the “im-
proper” trace. In other words, during these nine nanosec-
onds this symmetric DNA duplex always “remembers”
the asymmetry of its initial state.

The right two plates in Fig. 4 exhibits analogous traces
for TJI where all major groove water molecules were re-
moved at the beginning. The total number of water
molecules appears larger due to small variation of the
hydration procedure, notably, the initial 5 ˚A shell was
constructed with all crystallographic waters considered as
part of the duplex. Note that the structure again moves
out from the initial energy minimum and back, but the
maximal rmsd value reaches 2.8 ˚A which is much larger
than in the previous case. The deviation from the crys-
tal conformation is also one angstrom larger, and, impor-
tantly, the two rmsd traces level after 3 ns indicating that
the “memory” of the initial asymmetric conformation is
essentially lost.

This example illustrates the general eﬀect observed
in many other simulations. When the number of wa-
ter molecules is not suﬃcient to form a competent shell
they cannot diﬀuse and tend to occupy ﬁxed positions
thus stabilizing some random conformations and slowing
down the sampling. Very often they form ﬁlms that con-
nect several bases and phosphate groups and can induce
local bending of the helical axis. To reduce these eﬀects,
in the last few trajectories in Table I the major grove was
cleaned from the remaining water molecules before heat-
ing. This does not mean that we consider interactions in
the major groove unimportant. The present DNA model
essentially performs the structural analysis of water sur-
rounded by the mobile DNA walls in the minor groove.
The relatively small number of these molecules makes
possible nearly exhaustive sampling. In doing so we im-
plicitly assume that, due to much larger number of sol-
vent molecules involved in hydration of the major groove,
its water shell can easily take any necessary shape cor-
responding to a given DNA conformation. Our calcula-
tions show that an empty major groove is a much better
approximation of such behavior than a faintly hydrated
one.

D. Characteristic Hydration Patterns

Figure 5 shows the ﬁnal states of TJA and TJI with the
most stable hydration sites in the minor groove. Atom
coordinates from the trajectory points saved during the
last nanosecond were superimposed, and the position
ﬂuctuations were computed for all water molecules. Fig-
ure 5 shows average oxygen positions for 20 least mobile
water molecules in the minor groove, with the sites close
enough for hydrogen bonding joined by the thick lines.
The amplitudes of the position ﬂuctuations range from
0.5 to 1.0 ˚A and are close to that of the neighboring DNA
atoms indicating a tight binding. In case of TJA similar

FIG. 6. Schematic representation of the time evolution of
the minor groove hydration patterns in TJA and TJI. The
hydrogen bonding contacts shown for the central eight base
pairs were taken from individual snapshots as explained in
the text. The ﬁlled circles denote water molecules that keep
their orientations in all subsequent snapshots.

note water molecules that keep their orientation in all
subsequent snapshots. The orientation is considered to
be maintained if there is at least one chain to a cor-
rect water-base contact. For clarity the opposite strands
are shifted by one step with respect to the Watson-Crick
pairing.

In TJA most hydration sites were vacant after heat-
ing while already at 1.25 ns they are all occupied, with
the canonical spine structure formed in the middle which
spans over six consecutive base pairs. The total number
of water molecules selected by the foregoing rules slowly
increases during the whole trajectory; the spine short-
ens and is gradually replaced by less economical patterns
near both ends. The number of sites reaches 21 after
5 ns, but we note that the TJA plate in Fig. 6 actu-
ally shows 32 diﬀerent water molecules, which manifests
a certain level of exchange with the environment. It is
readily seen that the three water molecules that form the
ﬁrst layer of the hydration spine are the most stable in
this system. At the same time one notes that a transi-
tion from spine to ribbon type of hydration51 occurs at
the upper border of the spine.

The initial state for the TJI was prepared from the
Xray structure with new water molecules added to al-
ready occupied experimental hydration cites. That is
why in TJI the minor groove hydration is rather dense
already after heating. The total number of solvent
molecules selected by the chosen rules ﬂuctuates at the
level reached in TJA after 5 ns. As a whole the evolution
of hydration patterns is rather diﬀerent in TJI compared
to TJA, but still water molecules at the bottom of the
hydration spine are among the least movable. Note also
that in this case a reversible transition from the spine to

stable hydration sites in the minor groove. The average oxy-
gen positions of 20 least mobile water molecules in the minor
groove are joined by the thick lines if they are close enough
for hydrogen bonding.

sites are also found in the major groove, but as we noted
above they are not representative and we do not discuss
them here. In TJA the slowest water molecules form a
continuous cluster at the bottom of the minor groove. In
contrast, in TJI several such clusters are separated by ar-
eas where water is more mobile. In both cases, however,
in the middle of the minor groove a linear trace is found
corresponding to the characteristic hydration pattern of-
ten observed in crystals and referred to as the “hydration
spine”.50

Figure 6 shows schematically the time evolution of the
minor groove hydration patterns in these two trajecto-
ries. The hydrogen bonding contacts shown for the cen-
tral eight base pairs were taken from individual snap-
shots as follows. First, water molecules directly bound
to bases were considered and the shortest water bridges
between them were found. Only one and two member
bridges are shown in the ﬁgure. The ﬁlled circles de-

the ribbon type of hydration occurs at the upper spine
border.

Spontaneous formation of the hydration spine in the
middle of the minor groove has been observed in all tra-
jectories computed for the EcoRI dodecamer. This char-
acteristic water arrangement has been ﬁrst encountered
in the crystal structure of this duplex50 and is generally
considered as a characteristic feature of certain AT-rich
sequences that tend to adopt an unusual conformation
with a particularly narrow minor groove.52 We may con-
clude, therefore, that the present B-DNA model nicely
reproduces this well established experimental observa-
tion, which is the most probable origin of a surprisingly
good correspondence between the computed and exper-
imental DNA conformations. It can be noted also that
the water structure in the minor groove is rather per-
sistent and changes very slowly. As we discussed above,
due to the initial “cleaning” of the major groove in TJI
the DNA molecule lost the “memory” of the initial state
much faster than in TJD. Figure 6 demonstrates, how-
ever, that throughout the trajectory the hydration patter
is more spine-like in the lower part of the minor groove
and more ribbon-like in the upper part, the feature in-
herited from the initial Xray structure where the spine
expands from the center two times farther towards the
narrower end of the minor groove.53

It should be noted, ﬁnally, that the spine may be also
a model dependent feature. We have noticed that, al-
though trajectories always start from a well minimized
structure, the dynamics usually begins with rapid un-
winding and extending of the DNA molecule, which nar-
rows the minor groove and pushes much of the water out.
This occurs regardless of the sequence and the spine is
normally the ﬁrst hydration pattern that sets up after-
wards. The subsequent slow diﬀusion of water molecules
into the minor groove usually takes several nanoseconds
and often goes faster near the ends than in the middle.
Nevertheless, the high stability of this speciﬁc hydration
pattern in the center of the EcoRI dodecamer as well
as for some other sequences like A-tracts, which are not
considered here, is a sequence dependent feature. To sup-
port the last assertion we included in Tables I and II and
also in Figs. 1 and 2 trajectory TJL computed in simi-
lar conditions for a GC-alternating dodecamer. Table II
shows that, except for the twist, the ﬁnal TJL state has
average helical parameters even closer to the canonical
B-DNA than EcoRI dodecamer. Notably, its inclination
is negative and Xdisp is much less than in any EcoRI
trajectory. In terms of rmsd it is similarly close to the
canonical B-DNA. At the same time, the hydration pat-
terns in the minor groove were very diﬀerent from those
discussed above and it is seen in Figs. 1 and 2 that the
ﬁnal TJL state has the minor groove evenly wider than
in the canonical B-DNA form. The minor groove was
narrow in the initial phase of the trajectory and then
gradually opened. The distinct properties of regular se-
quences in this DNA model will be discussed in detail
elsewhere.

E. Long Range Electrostatics

The most surprising property of the present DNA
model is that its trajectories converge to conformations
that much better compare with experimental data than
in more expensive calculations with explicit counteri-
ons and rigorous treatment of electrostatic interactions.6
This would be less surprising if the adjustable parame-
ters of the simple ad hoc treatment employed here were
speciﬁcally ﬁtted to experimental data, but, in fact, we
have arbitrarily chosen one of the options earlier used
in conformational analysis of DNA, not even the best
recommended.54 These observations suggest that the pre-
cision of calculation of long range electrostatic interac-
tions may be generally less important for DNA structure
than it is sometimes supposed. A comprehensive anal-
ysis of this fundamental issue is beyond the capabilities
of this simple approach, nevertheless, it is interesting to
check how this B-DNA model responds to variation of
parameters involved in calculation of electrostatic inter-
actions.

The in vacuo trajectories TJE, TJF, and TJG were
computed with phosphate charges varied from -0.25 to
-0.75. They produce very similar structures with rmsd
between the ﬁnal TJE and TJG states around 0.5 ˚A and
the ﬁnal TJF state at roughly 0.3 ˚A from the both. Ta-
ble II exhibits very small, but regular variation of he-
lical parameters. Namely, growing phosphate repulsion
moves Xdisp, inclination and twist closer to the canoni-
cal B-DNA values, but propeller and rise in the opposite
direction. The rmsd’s of the ﬁnal MD states from the ref-
erence experimental DNA conformations are practically
identical for all three trajectories.

The same range of phosphate charges is covered by tra-
jectories TJH, TJI, TJJ and TJK where the minor groove
has been hydrated. Table II shows that in this case vari-
ations of helical parameters are stronger and less regular,
but some of them, notably, Xdisp, inclination and twist
exhibit the same trends as in vacuo. Reduction of phos-
phate repulsion accentuates already existing small devi-
ations from canonical B-DNA values towards A-DNA.
The increased repulsion has an opposite eﬀect and one
may expect that, in terms of helical parameters, the best
ﬁtting of the computed and experimental conformations
can be achieved with phosphate charges slightly below
-0.6 aeu. Unexpectedly, however, variation of phosphate
charges in an explicitly hydrated B-DNA model signiﬁ-
cantly aﬀects the overall bending of the molecule which
is seen in Fig. 1. In fact, all computed conformations
of the EcoRI dodecamer except TJB are slightly bent
towards the center of the minor groove. It appears that
the increase in the phosphate repulsion also increases this
bending, which is a non-trivial eﬀect of the minor groove
hydration since no such trend is observed in the in vacuo
conditions. This eﬀect deserves careful investigation be-
cause it in fact corresponds well to certain experimental
observations. Gel retardation experiments with sequence

8

repeats indicate that, in solution, the EcoRI dodecamer
should be bent towards the center of the minor groove.55
It is also known that DNA bending is generally reduced
in high salt56 which also reduces the persistence length of
DNA,57 with the latter eﬀect attributed to reduced phos-
phate repulsion due to better screening. Comparison of
the ﬁnal states of TJH, TJI, TJJ and TJK suggests that,
in the minimal B-DNA, bending is also somehow con-
nected with phosphate repulsion and increased backbone
stiﬀness also favors bending.

Because of the foregoing eﬀect the rmsd’s from exper-
imental B-DNA conformations does not follow the corre-
sponding deviations of helical parameters. In the case of
TJJ, for instance, the increased bending overshadows the
small improvement in helical parameters with respect to
the canonical B-DNA. These results generally show, how-
ever, that signiﬁcant variations of the most arbitrary pa-
rameter involved in our simplistic treatment of the elec-
trostatic eﬀects still result in structures that are close to
experimental B-DNA both in terms of helical parameters
and atom rmsd’s. Note that the largest rmsd in Fig. 1
observed for TJH is lower than in all reported simula-
tions with the particle-mesh Ewald method.6 Although
its helical parameters noticeably deviate from canonical
values it still qualitatively reproduces the characteristic
shape of the minor groove with a short hydration spine
in the center.

ter that should not be ignored. We expect, for instance,
that, in otherwise similar conditions, the rate of conver-
gence would be lower for a B-DNA duplexes with both
minor and major grooves hydrated explicitly. That is
why, in our opinion, the minimal B-DNA should be dis-
tinguished and used, notably, for equilibration of the sur-
face water in preparative phases of more expensive DNA
simulations.

The properties of this system are non-trivial and some-
times counter-intuitive. We have shown here that the
canonical B-DNA form presents a strong point of attrac-
tions in its conformational space, so that numerous tra-
jectories of the EcoRI dodecamer and one long trajectory
of the GC-alternating dodecamer converge to conforma-
tions with nearly canonical helical parameters. We have
shown that the sequence speciﬁc features of the EcoRI
dodecamer are nicely reproduced, namely, the proﬁle of
the minor groove and spontaneous formation of the char-
acteristic “spine” hydration pattern which is generally
considered as an indispensable part of this structure.50
To our knowledge, none of the numerous earlier theoret-
ical studies of this molecule could reach a comparable
level of agreement with experimental data. All these ob-
servations justify the minimal model of B-DNA, conﬁrm
its credibility and suggest that it has a potentially wide
scope of application.

F. Concluding Discussion

APPENDIX A: CORRECTED IMPLICIT
LEAPFROG INTEGRATOR

The minimal model of B-DNA explored here consists of
two qualitatively diﬀerent components, namely, the DNA
duplex and a water cloud docked in the minor groove.
Dynamics simulations of a naked B-DNA duplex show
that it presents a relatively simple object with a broad
energy valley around a single state with an intermediate
conformation between A and B DNA forms. This state is
“fragile” in the sense that BI → BII transitions, which are
generally believed to introduce only subtle nuances in the
B-DNA structure,58 cause gross structural transitions to
an essentially diﬀerent DNA form with a collapsed minor
groove.16 With a water cloud docked in the minor groove
the system acquires qualitatively diﬀerent properties. Its
potential energy landscape becomes rough, with multiple
signiﬁcant local minima corresponding to rearrangement
of atom-atom contacts in water and at the DNA-water
interface. Dynamics simulations of this system can be
viewed as structural analysis of water near a mobile sur-
face that carries a net negative charge and has a speciﬁc
distribution of hydrogen bonding contacts.

The main advantage of these simulation conditions is
the possibility of practically exhaustive sampling with
the presently available computer resources. It should be
noted that the sampling and the aﬀordable duration of
trajectories are not strict synonyms. The number of es-
sential degrees of freedom is another important parame-

These integrators had been in use for some time when
an important failure has been revealed. Note that, un-
like the classical leapfrog, algorithm Eqs. (A3) computes
both on-step and half-step coordinates, even though the
forces need not be computed for half steps. The two sets
of coordinates are coupled implicitly via the iterative cy-
cle Eqs. (A3b-A3d) where fn and wn+ 1
2 depend upon
on-step and half-step coordinates, respectively. However,
for each molecule the set of the generalized coordinates
includes three Cartesian coordinates of the ﬁrst atom9
for which the inertial term in Eq. (A1) is zero and thus
the algorithm is reduced to the standard leapfrog. This
means that the on-step and half-step translations are un-
coupled and the corresponding half-step generalized co-
ordinates can diverge. They, however, aﬀect angular ve-
locities via Eq. (A3d) thus becoming a hidden source of
instabilities.

The above eﬀect is exposed in Fig. 7a and 7b which
show the time ﬂuctuations of the potential energy com-
puted for on-step and half-step coordinates, respectively,
during a nanosecond trajectory of a hexamer DNA du-
plex with the sequence A6 · T6. The model system in-
cludes only two strands with no explicit water. During

the ﬁrst 100 ps no suspicious symptoms can be detected,
but after that the half-step energies exhibit irregular ﬂuc-
tuations. They result from atom clashes which do not
aﬀect the trajectory, and just serve here as indicators of
divergence. Figure 7 also explains why this problem has
not been noticed immediately. Note that, in spite of the
apparent diﬃculties, the trajectory has been successfully
ﬁnished and we can add that the computed total energy
was well conserved. For a single polymer chain this defect
is indistinguishable regardless of the chain lengths. For
ensembles of small molecules, like water, it produces a
small increase in the drift of the total energy after many
hundreds of picoseconds, which does not appear, how-
ever, if the trajectory is restarted periodically.
It be-
comes signiﬁcant only for DNA duplexes of 15 base pairs
and longer, but in this case the instability develops too
fast, without intermediate phase like in Fig. 7b, and re-
sults in sudden crashes of calculations which have been
initially attributed to some unclear physical eﬀects.

The problem is overcome by simply replacing Eqs.

(A3b) and (A2b) with

qn+ 1

2 = qn + ˙qn+ 1

(A4)

This equation explicitly couples the on-step and half-
step coordinates in the iteration cycle, which immedi-
ately eliminates all artifacts described above. Figures 7c
and 7d demonstrate the performance of the reﬁned inte-
grator (A2) for a trajectory starting from the same state
as in Figs. 7a and 7b. It is not diﬃcult to verify that
Eq. (A4) does not change neither the order nor the time
reversibility of integrators (A3) and (A2). It is not sur-
prising, therefore, that in standard quality tests, which
normally employ relatively short trajectories, this modi-
ﬁcation is absolutely neutral.

APPENDIX B: ANONYMOUS COMMENTS

This section contains comments from anonymous ref-
erees of two peer-review journals where the manuscript
has been considered for publication, but rejected.

1. Journal of Physical Chemistry

a. First referee

Summary:
In this paper, the author reports on results obtained
from dynamics calculations using a relatively new, “min-
imal” model for DNA salvation. This model consists es-
sentially of hydrating the minor groove of the DNA and
reducing the charges on the phosphate groups. Dynamics
were carried out where only torsions and bond angles on
sugars were free to change. Thus, this dynamics model

10

consists of many fewer degrees of freedom than the typ-
ical “good quality” DNA model, and dynamics can be
carried out with much less CPU time. A comparison of
the results using the minimal model indicates that these
results are in very good agreement with physical obser-
vation.

Review:
I am, quite frankly, very surprised at the results the
author obtains with this minimal model. It is a widely-
held belief that good realistic results for DNA dynamics
can only be obtained with an explicit (periodic box) wa-
ter model. More recently, it has been demonstrated that
with standard molecular dynamics and explicit periodic
water, one must also perform an Ewald type of calcula-
tions, whereby an inﬁnite water lattice about the DNA is
simulated. (See, in particular, the work of the Kollman
and Darden groups). Certainly, the reduced phosphate
model has been held in some disdain for years now as a
semi-physical kludge.

That said, proof is the results, and I (and everyone else
working in the DNA simulations ﬁeld) will be very grate-
ful if the minimal model holds up to additional testing.
And therein lies the rub... For while the tests per-
formed in the current paper are enticing, they are not re-
ally complete enough to punch the conclusions home. In
particular, a direct head-to-head comparison for the same
DNA sequence to the results obtained an explicit (peri-
odic box) water model and Ewald summation is missing.
I understand that such an explicit water simulation is
going to be much more cpu intensive. But it would con-
siderably strengthen the conclusions of the paper to have
such a comparison. In what ways do the results of the two
methods agree and disagree? Without knowing that, we
can’t really say, concertedly, whether the minimal model
produces crudely acceptable results or something quan-
titatively better.

The other issue that worries me is alluded to in the pa-
per. For the sequence used for the bulk of the simulations
in this paper, it is well-known that the waters form a well-
ordered “spine of hydration” in the minor groove. Could
it be that the reason this minimal model works so well
is that in this particular case is that the conformational
preferences of the model are dominated by the spine of
hydration? If so, it might be that the minimal model will
fail for many other sequences. It would be reassuring to
see the results of a number of other sequences, including
some that are not expected to form a well-deﬁned spine
of hydration. The author does include results for one se-
quence, poly GC, as an indication that good results can
be obtained even for sequences not generally observed to
for the well-deﬁned spine of hydration. But additional
non-AT rich examples would be valuable.

Overall, I think the results presented in this paper are
intriguing and food for additional thought. To make this
paper considerably stronger, I would really like to see
the comparison to explicit water dynamics. But with
that issue addressed (as well the point about diﬀerent
sequences), this is deﬁnitely work I would like to see in

print.

A ﬁnal note: I am not fully convinced that J. Phy.
Chem. would be the best place for this work. The
emphasis here is really on the empirical biophysically-
relevant results obtained with a previously published
model. There is relatively little discussion of physics of
the model itself. This is obviously and editorial judgment
call, however.

b. Second referee

This MS describes calculations attempting to model
DNA with a partial solvent model in which the minor
groove is ﬁlled with explicit water and the remainder of
the environment of the molecule is treated with a dis-
tance dependent dielectric screening function. Molecular
dynamics are performed to determine the trajectory of
the molecule in phase space and compared with other
relevant results.

In my consideration of this work, I cant really get
beyond the problem of why in the world anyone would
want to work on a model like this. Reports of MDs on
DNA with fully explicit solvent including ions at vari-
ous concentrations as well are typical of recent works and
projects described in the current literature from the Koll-
man group, Pettitt group and others. Thus it is not nec-
essary to make this approximation. Using this reduced
model would end up having to be validated individually
for each new sequence studied and there are surely cases
it would fail. Thus it is misdirected eﬀort to proceed
in this manner in my opinion, since it is highly unlikely
that this approach is the basis for methodology anyone
would want to seriously peruse. The fact that reasonable
results are obtained for the demonstration case does not
ally my concerns.

2. Biopolymers

a. First referee

The paper by Mazur is interesting and can be pub-
lished in Biopolymers as is, but it would be appropri-
ate to have the author comment on the applicability of
this model. Brieﬂy, he describes how a minimal model
of DNA with only minor groove waters is stable under
molecular dynamics for nanoseconds and stays closer to
expt than full solvation model with counterions (he scales

down the phosphate charges).
shows how this model is eﬀected by phosphate charge
and presence of major groove waters or exclusion of any
waters. These are interesting issues. The point that I
would like to have a comment is can such a model be
sued for anything beside duplex DNA in the B form. It
appears to be not appropriate for simulating the A to B

11

transition because of the need to have changes in hydra-
tion of the grooves during this process.

b. Second referee

There are some serious problems with this manuscript
in both scholarship and technique. As such I can not
recommend it for publication. To be speciﬁc:

1) Technically using the r-dielectric and explicit water
is double counting. Either the waters to close proximity
are counted in the explicit region or they are implicit.
Allowing the r-dielectric in the explicit region is explicitly
overcounting the hydration in that region. To add to that
the phosphate charge reduction compound the physical
picture nears to the point of having a non-physical model
with, therefore, questional predictive power.

2) There is a deep problem with controls in this study.
The amber force ﬁeld has an A-state which is not acces-
sible without the direct inﬂuence of coordinating ligands.
Thus the B-states are all that left at ambient tempera-
ture and salt conditions. This has been explored rather
intensely by a series of papers from the Kollman and
Pettitt groups. The conclusion left the paper makes is
thus that DNA in this force ﬁeld is not stable with the
r-dielectric, which is an old result, well known for some
time.

c. An adjudicator

I have a lot of trouble seeing what sort of future is for
the model discussed here. At best, it applies only to B-
form DNA with a particular force ﬁeld, and involves some
rather arbitrary elements (concerning phosphate charges,
and which waters to include). The author’s argument
that it could be used for “exhaustive” conformational
searches does not seem very convincing to me: if no sig-
niﬁcant sequence-dependent eﬀects were to be found, it
would be of little interest, and if there were interesting
structure variations, I ﬁnd it hard to believe that many
readers would trust the model used here, and calcula-
tions would need to be re-done anyway with more com-
plete representations of the solvent and counterion envi-
ronment. Given that the basic ideas have already been
reported (ref. 6), I would lean against publication of the
manuscript in its present form, which is largely devoted
to comparisons to other vacuum-like models whose limi-
tations are already widely appreciated.

Abstract

The eﬃcient simulation of models deﬁned in terms of stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tions (SDEs) depends critically on an eﬃcient integration scheme. In this article,
we investigate under which conditions the integration schemes for general SDEs can
be derived using the Trotter expansion. It follows that, in the stochastic case, some
care is required in splitting the stochastic generator. We test the Trotter integrators
on an energy-conserving Brownian model and derive a new numerical scheme for
dissipative particle dynamics. We ﬁnd that the stochastic Trotter scheme provides
a mathematically correct and easy-to-use method which should ﬁnd wide applica-
bility.

1 Introduction

The study of mesoscopic particle models such as Brownian dynamics (BD)[1],
Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) [2,3], Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dy-
namics (SDPD) [4] and the Voronoi ﬂuid particle model [5,6] requires eﬃcient
integration methods that solve the appropriate stochastic equations of motion.
In the past few years, several authors have considered improvements to the
basic stochastic Euler schemes normally applied to these systems of equations,

particularly in the context of “conventional” DPD. Groot & Warren [7], Pag-
onabarraga et al. [8] and Besold et al. [9] have reported various performance
improvements to the basic schemes through the use of more sophisticated de-
terministic solvers, for example those that have been successfully employed for
deterministic dynamical systems [10] including molecular dynamics (MD) sim-
ulations [11], such as the velocity and leapfrog Verlet algorithms. These tradi-
tional deterministic integrators provide signiﬁcant improvements on the basic
Euler solver albeit, being deterministic schemes, their behaviour is completely
uncontrolled from a theoretical point of view and their order of convergence
is not clear. In fact, these solvers arbitrarily leave out terms which should
appear in a correct stochastic expansion. More recently, alternative schemes
have been devised resulting from proper stochastic expansions [12,13], and
even from a Monte Carlo-based approach [14,15] where the ﬂuctuations are
introduced via a thermostat (the deterministic dynamics is still dependent on
the integrator).

A general method for deriving deterministic integrators is based on the Trot-
ter expansion [1,16]. For Hamiltonian systems, these schemes preserve the
symplectic structure of the dynamics and conserve the dynamical invariants,
ensuring that the long time behaviour is correctly captured. In fact, if a dynam-
ical invariant I exists then the discrete dynamics conserves exactly a virtual
invariant I ∗ which is bound to I up to second order in ∆t [10]. An important
feature of mesoscopic models is that they often recover a symplectic dynamics
in some limit, an example being the DPD model for vanishing friction coeﬃ-
cient. It may be important to account for this quasi-symplectic property of the
SDEs in the integration scheme by assuring that in the same limit the scheme
is symplectic as well [17].

Recently, a ﬁrst order stochastic generalisation of the Trotter expansion has
been rigorously proved [18,19]. In fact, for speciﬁc stochastic equations there
exist schemes up to weak fourth order [20] or schemes corrected to reproduce
more accurately the equilibrium distribution function [17]. The situation is less
clear for a general SDE (such as Eq. (2) in Section 2), for which the application
of the Trotter formula was overlooked in the literature, thereby generating
some confusion in terms of how the Trotter formula can be used to split the
stochastic equations. It is therefore useful to investigate the applicability of
the Trotter formula in the most general case. This is of direct relevance for
mesoscopic models which usually involve very large systems of SDEs.

The Trotter formula has been applied to devise eﬃcient integrators for sev-
eral speciﬁc mesoscopic models but often its use is limited to splitting the
propagator into several terms which are then integrated using standard nu-
merical schemes. This approach would correctly produce the order of accuracy
expected for the dynamics but potentially would aﬀect adversely the conser-
vation of the dynamical invariants or even detailed balance. Examples include

a numerical scheme suggested by a straightforward application of the Trot-
ter rule to the Voronoi ﬂuid particle model equations [21] which leads to time
steps that are two orders of magnitude larger than the standard Euler scheme.
In the context of the conventional DPD model, Shardlow [12,13] presented a
new scheme, which splits the stochastic and deterministic parts following the
Trotter rule, and then integrates the ﬂuctuation-dissipation generators using
the Bruenger et al. scheme [22] tailored onto the DPD equations. For Brownian
dynamics, Ricci & Ciccotti [23] derived a numerical integrator based on the
Trotter expansion which integrates the propagators by using the Suzuki for-
mula [24] to transform the time-ordered exponential solution of the Brownian
dynamics equations into more tractable simple exponentials.

α = bkjδα,j which are diﬀerent
from zero only in the column corresponding to noise α = j. By substituting

We are still left to integrate m single noise SDEs. We can try to decompose

which cannot be reduced to Fokker-Planck form for all terms. This means that
we cannot split variables over terms of the same noise to derive the integrator.
In fact, in order to apply the diagram of Fig. (1) and in particular step (c), we
need to have all the terms in Fokker-Planck form to derive the corresponding
SDEs. In principle, one could also try to separate the diﬀusion matrix dkl
α provided that each matrix dkl
itself into several simpler matrices dkl =

is positive deﬁnite, but then the non-unique square-roots of the matrices dkl

have to be computed in order to recover the SDEs. Practically, this is very
diﬃcult in general.

Finally, we must be able to compute the solution of the SDE corresponding to
the i term
Fi in order to write down the integration scheme. This is possible
for simple SDEs, otherwise we can take advantage of the splitting between the
drift and diﬀusion generators. The analytical solution of SDEs with zero drift
is conveniently calculated in the Stratonovich interpretation for the stochastic
integral (for a reference on Stratonovich integrals see [26]). In fact, the stan-
dard rules of ordinary calculus apply and the SDEs are eﬀectively integrated
like ordinary diﬀerential equations by formally considering dW as dt. An Itˆo
SDE like Eq. (2) is transformed into the equivalent Stratonovich form with
the usual rules for the drift

As the Trotter formula approximates the dynamics (3) of the probability dis-
tribution ρ up to second order in time, we expect that at the SDE level the
accuracy of the method is weak second-order [26], i.e. moments are accurate
to second order. Eﬀectively, the proposed decomposition at the FPE level al-
lows us to reduce the time-ordered exponential solution of SDE (2) in terms
of simple exponentials up to second order provided that the generators for the
same noise are not split.

3 An energy-conserving Brownian model

The oldest model for a stochastic system is the Langevin equation for a Brow-
nian particle. In the one dimensional case, the SDE governing the velocity of
vdt + (2T )1/2dW where we have selected units in which
the particle is dv =
the mass of the particle and friction coeﬃcient are unity and T is the di-
mensionless bath temperature. This equation predicts an exponential decay of
the velocity and, consequently, of the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle
which goes into the ﬂuid surrounding the particle. For illustrative purposes,
we can construct an energy-conserving model in which we include the energy
ǫ of the ﬂuid system, a Lagrangian reference system and a conservative force.
We use the dimensionless equations in Stratonovich form

where F =

dimensions and multiple particles are indeed fundamental building-blocks of
several mesoscopic models.

In practice, it is not necessary to move to a Fokker-Planck description to derive
the integration scheme. The derivation in section (2) shows that we can simply
apply the Trotter formula (1) over the generators of the SDEs (8) provided
that we do not split the stochastic generator for the same noise. The SDEs (8)

As already stated, it is not possible to decompose the stochastic generator

Unfortunately, this approach is what would follow if one was to apply naively
the Trotter formula to SDE (8). The resulting scheme would not be second
order and would conserve energy poorly. For instance, this is the case for the

altogether. However, wherever possible, this approach should be avoided
S
or limited to the smallest generator because the resulting integration scheme
may loose important structural features of the dynamics (as in the example
of SDEs (8)).

We validated numerically the integration schemes (12) and (15) as well as
the incorrect one (13). The simulations were run using the bistable potential
V (r) = β(r4
2r2) with α = 1, β = 1 and initial conditions r0 = 0, v0 = 0
and ǫ0 = 1. The average relative error for the total energy ∆E/E for dif-
ferent time step lengths ∆t is shown in Fig. 2. The error is computed by
averaging the maximum error reached by t = 1 over 10 independent runs. The
stochastic-Trotter scheme (12) conserves the energy with the same accuracy
as the deterministic Trotter scheme (computed using α = 0). The scheme (15)
is consistent with ﬁrst order accuracy (it is second order for single time step
error), while the incorrect scheme (13) does not conserve energy with ﬁrst
order accuracy. Note that the order for the cumulative error is one less than
the single time step error. Clearly, the energy conservation performance of
the Trotter scheme (12) is a direct consequence of the exact integration of its
stochastic component which is impossible to achieve by other general schemes.

4 A Trotter integration scheme for dissipative particle dynamics

We now apply the stochastic Trotter expansion to the equations of dissipative
particle dynamics. The DPD model consists of a set of N particles moving in

8

continuous space. Each particle k is deﬁned by its position rk and its momen-
tum pk and mass m. The dynamics is speciﬁed by a set of Langevin equations
very similar to the molecular dynamics equations, but where in addition to
the conservative forces there are dissipative and ﬂuctuating forces as well

In practice the integration algorithm consists of the following steps: for the
interaction pairs k,l update the momentum half timestep according to the
propagator (22), where ξkl = ξlk are drawn from a normal distribution with
zero mean and variance one; iterate over particles k updating the position
according to (23); ﬁnally, update pairs k,l in reverse order again using the
propagator (22) but with new noise ξ′
kl. This algorithm requires the calculation
of the pair-list only once per iteration and has the same complexity as a simple
DPD velocity-Verlet scheme (DPD-VV [7]).

We test this integration scheme using the open-source code mydpd [28] written
in simple C++ and implementing the DPD models described here with peri-
odic boundary conditions. The simulations are run with N = 4000 particles,

computed by block-averaging, is less than

akl = 25, γ = 4.5, σ = 3, m = 1, rc = 1 in a three dimensional periodic box
(L, L, L) with L = 10. These settings give a particle density ρ = 4 and equilib-
rium temperature kBT = 1. In our implementation, the computational cost of
each scheme averaged over several iterations indicates that the Trotter scheme
is 10% more costly than the simple DPD-VV but 60% faster than the Shardlow
S1 scheme (which costs almost twice than DPD-VV). The equilibrium temper-
ature for the DPD-Trotter scheme of Eq. (24), DPD-VV [7] and Shardlow [12]
schemes is reported in Table 1. The DPD-Trotter scheme recovers the equilib-
rium temperature better than DPD-VV, but less accurately than Shardlow’s
scheme. This diﬀerence depends on the implicit scheme used by Shardlow for
the integration of the pair interaction. In our case, we have used an exact
integration Eq. (20) which, however, requires the generation of coloured noise
[27] which is by itself a numerical scheme. Considering the accuracy of the
equilibrium temperature and the computational cost, both DPD-Trotter and
Shardlow schemes are integrators of comparable performance for the DPD
equations. A more detailed study of the equilibrium properties of the ﬂuid is
necessary to assess the accuracy in reproducing the equilibrium distribution
and other statistical properties.

5 Conclusions

The stochastic Trotter schemes can provide eﬃcient integrators for stochastic
models with dynamical invariants by fully taking into account the underlying
stochastic character. The stochastic Trotter formula can be applied to any
model based on SDEs and should ﬁnd wide applicability provided that some
care is used to decouple the stochastic dynamics for the same noise. These
types of stochastic schemes oﬀer the ﬂexibility to easily tailor the integrator
to the speciﬁc model, thereby integrating exactly important parts of the dy-
namics. This stochastic Trotter scheme is a second order weak scheme, but,

11

more important, in our examples it provides very good conservation of the
dynamical invariants.

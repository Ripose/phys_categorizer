We simulate dopant proﬁles for phosphorus implantation into silicon using a new model
for electronic stopping power. In this model, the electronic stopping power is factorized
into a globally averaged eﬀective charge Z ∗
1 , and a local charge density dependent elec-
tronic stopping power for a proton. There is only a single adjustable parameter in the
model, namely the one electron radius r0
1 . By ﬁne tuning this pa-
rameter, we obtain excellent agreement between simulated dopant proﬁles and the SIMS
data over a wide range of energies for the channeling case. Our work provides a further
example of implant species, in addition to boron and arsenic, to verify the validity of the
electronic stopping power model and to illustrate its generality for studies of physical
processes involving electronic stopping.

1. Introduction

Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of ion trajectories in a target ma-
terial require a good description of the physics of electronic stopping in the high
energy regime. The issue of the electronic stopping power is especially important
when the target is crystalline and ions can propagate along preferred channel direc-
tions in the lattice. For this case, electronic stopping becomes a dominant factor in
determining ﬁnal stopping ranges of the channeling ions. As is well known, the clas-
sic Lindhard-Scharﬀ-Schiott theory1 is applicable only to amorphous materials and
underestimates electronic stopping along channeling directions. It thus tends to give
an excessively high estimate of the energy threshold below which electronic stop-
ping eﬀects can safely be neglected when modeling ion implantation into crystalline
materials. For the channeling case, a good understanding of electronic stopping is
essential because the distribution of stopping ranges of ions can still be signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by the electronic stopping power even at relatively low energies.

Recently we proposed a model for electronic stopping power for ion implanta-
tion modeling.2 Based on the spirit of the Brandt-Kitagawa (BK) eﬀective charge
theory,3 it models the electronic stopping power for an ion in terms of two fac-
tors: (i) a globally averaged eﬀective charge taking into account eﬀects of close and
distant collisions by target electrons with the ion, and (ii) a local charge density
dependent electronic stopping power for a proton. This model was implemented
into both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The results of the
dopant proﬁle simulation for both boron and arsenic implants into crystalline and
amorphous silicon have demonstrated that our model can successfully capture the
physics of electronic stopping in ion implantation over a wide range of energies.
The model is phenomenologically economical, i.e., it has only one tuning parame-
ter, namely an averaged one electron radius r0
s which controls the eﬀective charge
of the ion. A single numerical value of this parameter was used for the simula-
tion of both boron and arsenic implantation. Good agreement of dopant proﬁles
with experimental proﬁles measured by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS)
was achieved for both species with this single r0

s numerical value.

We note that the BK theory uses a statistical model for the partially ionized
projectile and does not account for shell structure. Therefore, it can only provide
an averaged description of electronic stopping power as a function of the projectile
atomic number Z1.4 The experimentally observed Z1 oscillations in electronic stop-
ping are a complex phenomenon, attributable to the electronic shell structures of
both the incident ion and the target atom.5,6,7,8,9 On account of the dependence
of the Z1 oscillation on both the ion and target material, we expect that the pa-
rameter r0
s can be tuned to diﬀerent numerical values for diﬀerent combinations
of implant species and substrate material. This ﬁne tuning can be viewed as a
phenomenological procedure to incorporate the physics of Z1 oscillations. In the
present work, we will verify this phenomenological approach for phosphorus im-
plantation into silicon and show that our electronic stopping power can successfully
model channeling of phosphorus implants into single-crystal silicon, thus extending
our electronic stopping power model to the case of phosphorus-on-silicon implants.
This further illustrates the potential wide applicability of the model in studies of
physical processes that involve electronic stopping.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we summarize the main features of
our electronic stopping power model and brieﬂy compare it with other models that
have been used in various Monte Carlo simulations. Atomic units e = ¯h = me = 1
are used in the description of our model. In Sec. 3 we describe the implementation
of our model into a MARLOWE platform,10 and into a molecular dynamics (MD)
based implant simulator.11 We then present a comparison between our simulation
results and SIMS data for phosphorus implantation into silicon. In Sec. 4 we make
concluding remarks.

2. The Model

In our model,2 based on an eﬀective charge scaling argument, the electronic stopping
power of an ion can be factorized into two components. One is the eﬀective charge
Z ∗

1 of the ion of velocity v1, which can be expressed as

Z

∗
1 = Z1γ(v1, r0

s ),

where Z1 is the atomic number of the ion and γ(v1, r0
s ) is the fractional eﬀec-
tive charge of the ion. The second is the charge density dependent electronic
stopping power for a proton Sp(v1, rs). Here rs is the one electron radius, rs =
[3/ (4πρ(x))]1/3, where ρ(x) is the charge density of the target. In our treatment
γ(v1, r0
s ) does not depend on the local charge density, instead, it is controlled by
the parameter r0
s , which is the only adjustable parameter in the model.
After taking account of the energy loss of the ion in soft, distant collisions with
target electrons and the energy loss in hard close collisions, the BK analysis gives
the fractional eﬀective charge

Here C is weakly dependent on the target and has a numerical value of about 1/2.

which is used in the statistical model to describe the partially ionized projectile.
Here a0 = 0.24 005 and the ionization fraction q(v1, r0
s ) obeys the following scaling

q(v1, r0

1) = 1 − exp[−0.95(yr(v1, r0

s) − 0.07)].

This scaling was condensed from extensive experimental data for ions 3 ≤ Z1 ≤ 92.12

where vB is the Bohr velocity. Underlying Eq. (4) is the stripping criterion that the

is the Ritchie formula for the energy loss per unit path length of a proton moving

tion factor G(rs) is a computationally convenient way to incorporate the density-
functional results and it has the following form

for rs < 6. It should be emphasized that Sp(v1, rs) in our model depends on the
local charge density, ρ(x) = 3/(4πrs(x)3). We note in passing that the density-
functional result gives a better estimate than the linear response (dielectric) result
for the stopping powers as demonstrated in the comparisons with experimental
data.15,16 The charge density, ρ(x), for atoms in crystal silicon in our model uses
the solid-state Hartree-Fock atomic charge distribution.12 In this approximation,
there is about a one electron charge not accounted for inside the spherical muﬃn-
tin. This small amount of charge is distributed between the maximal collision
distance used in our Monte Carlo simulations and the muﬃn-tin radius;2 within the
MD scheme it provides a background charge experienced by the ion when further
than the muﬃn-tin radius from any silicon atom.11

In our simulation, the electronic stopping power is evaluated continuously along
the path the ion traverses through regions of varying charge density. The energy
loss is computed by

∆Ee =

[Z1γ(v1, r0

s)]2Sp(v1, rs(x))dx.

Zion path

Finally, we discuss the diﬀerence between our approach and other electronic
stopping power models used in Monte Carlo simulations based on the MARLOWE
platform. There is a purely nonlocal version of the BK theory implemented into
MARLOWE,17 where the eﬀective charge and the stopping power for a proton both
depend on a single nonlocal parameter, i.e., the averaged one electron radius. The
energy loss for well-channeled ions in the keV region in this approach indicated that
a correct density distribution is necessary to model the electronic stopping in the
channel.17,18 Later, an implementation of a purely local version of the BK theory to
model boron implants into h100i single-crystal silicon produced dopant proﬁles in
good agreement with the SIMS data.19 It showed a marked improvement in modeling
dopant proﬁles in the channel over other electronic stopping power models, such as

Simulation of Phosphorus Implantation Into Silicon 5

Lindhard and Scharﬀ,20 Firsov,21 and the above nonlocal implementation. However,
this purely local version was unable to model the electronic stopping either for boron
implants into the h110i axial channel, or for arsenic implants.22

In our model, the eﬀective charge is a nonlocal quantity, neither explicitly depen-
dent on the impact parameter nor on the charge distribution, while the stopping
power for a proton depends on the local charge density of silicon.
It has been
shown that it can successfully model both boron and arsenic implants into silicon
over a wide range of energies and in diﬀerent channeling and oﬀ-axis directions of
incidence.2,11 In the following section, we will demonstrate that this model can be
further extended to phosphorus implantation into silicon. In light of Z1 oscillations,
r0
s will take a slightly diﬀerent numerical value from the one used in the simulations
for boron and arsenic implantation.2

3. Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics Simulation Results

We have implemented the electronic stopping power model into the Monte Carlo
simulation platform MARLOWE, which utilizes the binary collision approximation
(BCA) to simulate the trajectories of energetic ions in crystalline or amorphous
materials.23,24 For the present work, we used an extended version of MARLOWE
with enhanced capabilities for modeling ion implant into silicon. This code, UT-
MARLOWE,10 was selected for its more versatile features, including variance re-
duction for more eﬃcient calculation, and the incorporation of important implant
parameters, e.g., tilt and rotation angles, the thickness of the native oxide layers,
beam divergence, and wafer temperature. The electronic stopping power model is
also incorporated into an MD based implant simulator, REED.11 This allows us
to calculate proﬁles using a more realistic description of atomic collisions during
implants than that provided by the BCA. It also gives us an additional veriﬁcation
of the model, and shows that it is independent of the simulation platform.

For the purpose of verifying the electronic stopping model, the option of the
cumulative damage model in the UT-MARLOWE code was turned oﬀ in our sim-
ulations. This is a phenomenological model for estimating defect production and
recombination rates. The REED cumulative damage model was also disabled. In
order to minimize cumulative damage eﬀects in the dopant proﬁles, simulations
were performed for low to moderate dose (1013 cm−2 to 3 × 1013 cm−2) phospho-
rus implants. Individual ion trajectories were simulated and the overlapping of the
damage caused by diﬀerent individual ion cascades was neglected. Also, use was
made of 1◦ initial beam divergence, a 16 ˚A native oxide surface layer, and 300 K
wafer temperature. These parameters were not cited in the experimental references
but are believed to be typical for silicon doping implants.

The best suited data for verifying the electronic stopping model are the on-axis
or h100i channeling implants. These data are highly sensitive to electronic stopping
and are relatively insensitive to other eﬀects, especially at energies of 100 keV and
above where electronic stopping becomes the dominant energy loss mechanism. The
s was adjusted to 1.148 ˚A to yield the best results in
free parameter in the model r0

6 D. Cai, C. M. Snell, K. M. Beardmore & N. Grønbech-Jensen

overall comparison between the BCA and SIMS proﬁles. A ﬁxed numerical value
of r0
s was employed for all energies and directions of incidence. As commented
before,2 this value is physically reasonable for silicon. We note that there is only
s and the value of 1.109 ˚A previously
a 3.5% diﬀerence between this value of r0
used to obtain the best overall agreement with experimental data for boron and
arsenic.2 This diﬀerence is quite small, and our result indicates that, in general,
Z1 oscillations can be accounted for by ﬁne-tuning of r0
s for a given combination
of implant species and material. A slightly larger value of 1.217 ˚A was used for r0
s
within the MD simulations. This diﬀerence reﬂects the fact that the description of
ion channelling and energy loss diﬀers between the BCA and MD schemes, and that
while ﬁtting the electronic stopping model we are also compensating for deﬁciencies
in the implant simulation models.

We now turn to our Monte Carlo and MD dopant proﬁle simulation results. For
comparison we have digitized the SIMS data for phosphorus reported in Refs. 9
and 25. The simulated phosphorus dopant proﬁles are shown in comparison to the
SIMS data for the channeling case in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Here, the implant energy
ranges from 15 keV to 200 keV. The incidence is along the h100i direction with
zero tilt and zero rotation angles. The dose is 1013 cm−2 or 3 × 1013 cm−2. The
simulations show a close ﬁt to the dopant distributions with depth and describe
especially well the slope of the channeling tails of the dopant proﬁles. Some un-
certainty is introduced into these comparisons by the fact that the exact implant
parameters employed in the experiments are not known. Ion channeling ranges for
on-axis implants may be sensitive to variations in these parameters, especially to
the beam divergence. Fig. 5 illustrates the eﬀect of changing the assumed beam
divergence from 1◦ to 0◦. As expected, the lower divergence gives a shallower slope
and deeper penetration in the channeling tail. Best agreement with the SIMS proﬁle
is achieved for a divergence angle of 1◦, which is quite reasonable for commercial
implant machines. This value was employed in all other calculations presented here.

Another source of uncertainty is the possible inﬂuence of disorder introduced by
damage to the silicon, which can reduce the average range of channeled ions. This
eﬀect was ignored in our calculations. The importance of damage can be roughly
evaluated by comparing the measured SIMS proﬁles at diﬀerent doses, as in Figs. 2
and 3.
It is seen that the proﬁles at the higher dose are similar the lower dose
proﬁles, but that a three-fold increase in dose results in an almost ﬁve-fold increase
in dopant concentration at the peak while only doubling the concentration in the
tail. However the depth of the peak and end-of-range of the proﬁle are unaltered
by the addition of damage. Hence, we can compare the ‘zero damage’ simulations
to the higher dose (3 × 1013 cm−2) SIMS data, but must be aware that the slope
of the channelling tail may not match – the MD proﬁle in Fig. 4 shows this eﬀect.

We conclude that the overall agreement between the simulations and experimental
data for the channeling cases is excellent over a wide range of energies – especially
considering that the electronic stopping model implemented in the BCA platform
has been tuned by only 3.5% in the parameter, r(0)
s .

Figs. 6 and 7 show the simulated dopant proﬁles in the oﬀ-axis directions,
10◦ tilt and 15◦ rotation for 100 keV, and 8◦ tilt and 18◦ rotation for 200 keV,
respectively. The BCA calculated proﬁles show less good agreement with SIMS
data than for channeling cases, with systematically deeper penetration and the
concentration peak shifted by about 25% – a similar, but smaller shift is also seen
for the 200 keV on-axis implant (Fig. 4).

The explanation for this discrepancy lies in the diﬀerent roles of energy loss and
scattering mechanisms for the oﬀ-axis implants. The average ﬁnal stopping range
for ions implanted in oﬀ-axis directions is controlled primarily by nuclear scattering,

and also by inelastic energy loss21 during ion-atom interactions; it is less sensitive to
the electronic stopping model (except at very high energies above those investigated
in this study). Accurate prediction of the oﬀ-axis proﬁles thus requires an accurate
model for the atom-speciﬁc interatomic potential of the two species involved in
the implant, plus a description of inelastic energy loss. We do not currently have
an atom-speciﬁc potential model for phosphorus and silicon in the BCA platform,
and there is no attempt to account for inelastic energy loss due to momentum
transfer between electrons during collisions. The signiﬁcance of these omissions
in the BCA model was examined by performing separate calculations for random
implant directions and for an implant into amorphous silicon (not shown here).
These cases are completely dominated by nuclear scattering and are insensitive to
electronic stopping in this energy range. The penetration ranges were too large by
about 20%, verifying that nuclear scattering and inelastic energy loss are largely

10 D. Cai, C. M. Snell, K. M. Beardmore & N. Grønbech-Jensen

responsible for the over prediction of ranges seen in the oﬀ-axis calculations.

The MD platform (REED) uses pair-speciﬁc potentials12 for all ion-silicon in-
teractions, and includes an inelastic energy loss model.26 The oﬀ-axis proﬁles cal-
culated by MD have the correct peak position and shallower penetration than the
BCA proﬁles, and provide a better match to the SIMS data. The BCA predictions
could probably be improved by the relatively simple addition of the two models
mentioned above to the BCA platform, although that is outside the scope of this
paper. Proﬁles calculated by both simulation models show an increased amount of
channelling relative to the SIMS proﬁles. The channelling tail is due to incident ions
being scattered into channelling directions in near-surface collisions. The number
hard collisions near the surface due to oﬀ-axis implants will produce a signiﬁcant
amount of damage, even at a dose as low as 1013 cm−2. Hence we should expect
the ‘zero damage’ calculated proﬁles to show exaggerated channelling relative to
the experimental data.

4. Conclusion

We have used our electronic stopping power model to simulate dopant proﬁles for
phosphorus implantation into silicon. To account for Z1 oscillations, we have ap-
propriately ﬁne-tuned the single adjustable parameter r0
s in our model to match the
phosphorus-silicon case. The numerical value of r0
s is slightly greater than the one
s = 1.148 ˚A, our BCA results
used for boron and arsenic simulations. Using this r0
show excellent agreement between the simulated dopant proﬁles and the SIMS data
over a wide range of energies for the channeling case. Less accurate but satisfac-
tory results are obtained for oﬀ-axis implants. Detailed agreement in the oﬀ-axis
direction would require additional model development for ion-silicon interactions.
We have also implemented the stopping model in an MD based simulator, using
a slightly larger value for r0
s . Using the MD implant model we achieve excellent
agreement with SIMS data for both on-axis, and oﬀ-axis implants. In summary,
we have successfully extended our electronic stopping power model to encompass
phosphorus implantation into crystalline silicon. We have also indicated how to
incorporate Z1 oscillations with a simple phenomenological approach. We have
provided a further example of implant species to verify validity of the model and
to demonstrate its generality for studies of physical processes involving electronic
stopping.

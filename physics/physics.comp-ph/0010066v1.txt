(September 24, 2013)

A quantum Monte Carlo method is introduced to optimize excited state trial wave functions.
The method is applied in a correlation function Monte Carlo calculation to compute ground and
excited state energies of bosonic van der Waals clusters of upto seven particles. The calculations
are performed using trial wavefunctions with general three-body correlations.

Solving the Schr¨odinger equation for systems in which the zero-point energy is relatively large and gives rise to strong
anharmonicity poses a computational challenge, even for few-particle systems. With discrete variable representation
methods (DVR)1 one can obtain many states for systems with upto six vibrational degrees of freedom and intermediate
zero-point energy. Projector Monte Carlo methods such as the correlation function method (CFMC)2,3 and the
projector operator imaginary time spectral evolution (POITSE)4 method, are applicable to more degrees of freedom,
but both methods are restricted to a smaller number of states. A diﬀerence between the correlation function and
projector operator Monte Carlo methods is the way in which they extract energies from correlation functions, but
both require ancillary quantities to boost the spectral weight of the excited states. The method presented in this
Letter makes it possible to construct these quantities in a systematic and eﬃcient way, which has been used to enhance
the CFMC method signiﬁcantly. In fact, without optimized wavefunctions the CFMC methods does not produce any
meaningful results for most of the clusters for which we report results. We also expect that results of the POITSE
method can be improved substantially, by using spectral enhancement operators based on optimized wavefunctions.
A variant of the method described here was applied previously to study critical dynamics of lattice systems.5,6

The application in this Letter is to bosonic van der Waals clusters, which we treat in the position representation.
We denote by R the Cartesian coordinates of a cluster consisting of Nc atoms. As a preliminary step in the parameter
optimization, we generate a set of typically thousands of conﬁgurations Rσ, σ = 1, . . . , Σ sampled from a guiding
g with relative probabilities ψg(Rσ)2 ≡ w−2
function ψ2
σ ; to ensure that the sample has suﬃcient overlap with all states
g = ˜ψ(1), where ˜ψ(1) is the optimized ground state
in our computations, we choose a power p with 2 <
∼ p <
wavefunction, which is obtained after a few initial optimization iterations for a simple ground state wave function.

The trial functions are linear combinations of about a hundred elementary basis functions, each of which depends
on non-linear optimization parameters. The trial functions are constructed one at a time from the ground state up,
as follows.

Suppose we ﬁx the non-linear parameters of the elementary basis functions, denoted by βi, i = 1, . . . , n, at initial
values. First, we consider the ideal case in which these functions span an n-dimensional invariant subspace of the
Hamiltonian H, i.e., we assume that there exists an n × n matrix E so that

is an eigenvector of H with an eigenvalue ˜Ek which equals the exact energy Ek, if d(k) is a right eigenvector of E with
the same eigenvalue.
In practice, the subspace spanned by the basis functions is not invariant, and Eq. (1) yields an overdetermined set
of Σ × n equations for the n2 unknowns Eij . The equations can be solved approximately by minimizing the sum of
squared residuals with respect to the Eji. This gives the normal equations

The weights w2
σ were chosen in the orthogonality relation Eq. (3) to reproduce the standard quantum mechanical
overlap integrals and matrix elements in the limit of an inﬁnite Monte Carlo sample. In this case each variational
energy ˜Ek is an upper bound to the exact energy Ek.

In all but the simplest cases, the elementary basis functions are quasi-dependent, in the sense that some of the
eigenvalues of N diﬀer from zero less than the roundoﬀ error. As a consequence, direct application of Eq. (4) yields
numerically unstable results. The standard solution to this problem is to use a singular value decomposition to write7

B = U SrV T ,

(7)

where U and V are square orthogonal matrices of order Σ and n, while Sr is a rectangular Σ × n matrix with zeroes
everywhere except for its leading diagonal elements σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ σr > 0; r is chosen such that the remaining singular
values are close to zero.8 From Eq. (7) one obtains

E = VrS−1

r U T

r B ′,

(8)

where Ur is the Σ × r matrix consisting of the ﬁrst r columns of U ; and Vr is the n × r matrix likewise obtained from
V .
With this choice of the linear variational parameters, we can now —following Umrigar et al.,9— optimize the

non-linear parameters in the elementary basis functions by minimization of

the variance of the energy of the wavefunction given in Eq. (2).

We consider clusters of atoms of mass µ, interacting pairwise via a Lennard-Jones potential. In dimensionless form,
the pair potential can be written as v(r) = r−12− 2r−6 and the Hamiltonian as H = −P 2/2m + V , where P and V are
the total kinetic and potential energy operators, while the only parameter is the dimensionless mass m−1 = ¯h2/µσ2ǫ,
which is proportional to the square of the de Boer parameter.10

The trial functions11,12 are deﬁned in terms of the interparticle distances rστ and scaled variables ˆrστ = f (rστ );
f maps the interparticle distances monotonically onto the interval (−1, 1) in the region in which the wavefunction
diﬀers appreciably from zero, but the explicit form of f is not important for the current discussion. The elementary
basis functions used for the trial wavefunction of energy level k have non-linear variational parameters a(k)
, and are
of the form

The prefactor polynomial si has bosonic symmetry, and contains general three-body correlations, since all polynomials
symmetric in x, y, and z can be written as polynomials in the three invariants Il = xl + yl + zl, with l = 1, 2, 3 and

v.v..11 The number of elementary basis functions is limited by an upper bound on the total degree Pl lnil; the

polynomials sj in the exponent are of the same form as those in the prefactor, and their number in Eq. (10) is limited
similarly.

The constant κk is determined after a few iterations so that the wavefunction has the correct exponential decay in
the limit that a single particle goes oﬀ to inﬁnity. Assuming —as is plausible for the small clusters studied here—
that the energy of a cluster is roughly proportional to the number of particle pairs13, we ﬁnd

States of higher energy are found with the same optimization scheme by selecting the appropriate eigenvector d(k)
of the matrix E and inserting it into Eq. (2). We use the same scaling function f for all states, but diﬀerent non-linear
parameters a(k)
and κk. This scheme works as long as the variational freedom of the trial functions can accurately
represent the true eigenstates. Otherwise, for the Monte Carlo samples of the size we are using, states can be skipped
and spurious ones may be introduced. In this context, noting that the exponential factors diﬀer for each state, we
found it useful to check consistency of eigensystems obtained with this basis set and one that includes the variational
wavefunctions of the previously determined, lower-lying states.

The trial wavefunctions constructed in this fashion are used as basis functions in a correlation function Monte
Carlo calculation.2,3. Formally, this means that the n elementary basis functions βi are replaced by a small number of
2 tH) ˜ψ(k). For this part of the computation the analog of Eq. (4) is used to compute eigenvalues, rather
functions exp(− 1
than Eq. (8). The reason for this is that, except during optimization, too many conﬁgurations Rα are sampled to
store the full matrices B and B ′, deﬁned in Eqs. (6). These matrices are required for the singular value decomposition
in Eq. (8). However, this is not a serious problem since the ﬁnal basis functions ˜ψ(k) are few in number and roughly
orthonormal, at least for small projection times t.

It may appear that we used stationarity of the energy to determine the linear variational coeﬃcients d(k)

, but a
subtlety arrises because the integrals in matrix elements were approximated by weighted sums. Consider, therefore,
in more detail the expectation value ˜E of the energy in state ψ and its functional derivative

i

δ ˜E
δψ(R) ∝ (H − ˜E) ψ(R).

(13)

For an energy eigenstate, the derivative vanishes both pointwise and in norm, which respectively corresponds to
stationarity of the energy and minimality of its variance. Although these two criteria are equivalent for arbitrary
functional variations, they yield diﬀerent approximations, for the restricted variations of trial functions used in practice,
as is well known. Orthogonality of the functional derivative and any wavefunction, suggests yet a third approximation:
orthogonality —in the ﬁnite sample sense of Eq. (3)— of the functional derivative and the elementary basis functions,
or more generally the derivatives of the trial function with respect to the variational parameters. For a ﬁnite sample
this orthogonality is not equivalent to stationarity of the approximate, sample average of the energy with respect to
the variational parameters, which yields Eq. (4) with H replaced by its symmetrized analog.

An important advantage of the orthogonality and variance criteria is that they yield zero variance for the energy
and the variational parameters, because the right-hand side of Eq. (13) vanishes for an exact eigenstate even on a ﬁnite
sample. On the other hand, stationarity of ﬁnite-sample estimate of the energy yields estimates of the variational
parameters and the energies that diﬀer from sample to sample.

Instead of this hybrid method which treats linear and non-linear variational parameters diﬀerently, we ﬁrst at-
tempted to use minimization of the variance of the energy by application of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to
all parameters simultaneously. Although that method works for statistical mechanical applications,6 it fails for our
current application, unless one starts out with good initial guesses for all parameters.14

Next we present results for excited state energies for clusters with up to seven atoms. First, we computed energies
for trimers of Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe (m = 7.092 × 10−3, 6.9635 × 10−4, 1.9128 × 10−4, and 7.8508 × 10−5). Since
our variational functions contain general three-body correlations, the accuracy of the wavefunctions and energies for
the trimers can be improved without apparent limit other than the machine precision. During optimization of the
wavefunctions for the trimers we typically start with the ground state wavefunction which has prefactor degree of
5 or 6. For the trimers we chose not to vary the polynomial coeﬃcients in the exponent and simply used the ﬁxed
terms to satisfy the boundary conditions. The quality of the wave functions may be improved by varying polynomial
coeﬃcients in the exponent, and for larger clusters it becomes important to include them.

For the optimization we used a sample consisting of 4000 conﬁgurations and gradually increased the prefacor degree
to improve quality of the trial functions. For Ne clusters we performed diﬀusion Monte Carlo15 calculations using
optimized wavefunctions with prefactor degrees up to 14. We found that the projected energies have converged
when the prefactor degree of 12 and higher is used. The results presented in Table I were obtained using variational
wavefunctions with degree of 12 in the prefactor.

Before we present detailed estimates of the energy we mention the sources of errors of this method.2 In addition to
the usual statistical errors of Monte Carlo computations, there are two systematic errors. For any ﬁnite projection
time t and in the limit of vanishing statistical errors, the energies computed by this method are upper bounds to the

exact energies.16 In practice, since the errors increase with projection time one should choose the smallest projection
time such that the corresponding error and statistical errors are of the same order of magnitude. A troublesome detail
is that at that point the results tend to have a non-Gaussian distribution,17 which makes it diﬃcult to produce error
bars with a sharply deﬁned statistical meaning. In addition, there is the time-step error, which arrises because the
imaginary-time evolution operator exp(−tH) has to be evaluated as the limit τ → 0 of [exp(−τH) + O(τ 2)]t/τ , but
this error is much more easy to control.
In order to eliminate the time-step error from the diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculation we veriﬁed that there was no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between time steps τ =0.4, 0.2 and 0.1. In the diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculations
we use 1.3 million Monte Carlo steps (16 blocks with 80 000 data per block). For Ar, Kr, and Xe trimers we found
that the quality of the wavefunctions does not improve beyond the degree of 10 in the prefactor. The results in Table
I for the three more massive noble gas atoms were obtained using trial wavefunctions with polynomials of degree 10.
Independence of the time-step error within the statistical error was established by comparing τ =0.8, 0.6, and 0.4.
The number of Monte Carlo steps is the same as for Ne. The results in Table I agree with, and in some cases improve
upon, those of Leitner et al.13.

In Table II we present results for the energies of the ﬁrst ﬁve levels of Ar clusters of sizes 4 through 7. Our method
allows one to go beyond 7 atom clusters, but as one can see from Table II the statistical error increase with system size.
To obtain more accurate results for larger clusters it would probably be helpful to include higher order correlations
in the wavefunction. In the calculations for 4 through 7 atom clusters we used a 10 degree prefactor and an exponent
of degree three. Again, 1.3 million step diﬀusion Monte Carlo results were compared for τ =0.8, 0.6, and 0.4.

Finally, Fig. 1 contains three energy levels as a function of mass for a four particle cluster. The results are plotted
using variables chosen so that there is linear dependence both for large masses and for energies close to zero.12
As the energy of the levels approaches zero, both the optimization and the projection methods begin to fail, and
correspondingly data points are missing. Again, the use of trial wavefunctions with four-body correlations are likely
to allow one continue to smaller masses.

For real world systems, nonuniform medium is ubiquitous. Therefore, we investigate the diﬀusion-
limited-aggregation process on a two dimensional directed small-world network instead of regular
lattice. The network structure is established by rewiring connections on the two dimensional directed
lattice. Those rewired edges are controlled by two parameters θ and m, which characterize the
spatial length and the density of the long-range connections, respectively. Simulations show that
there exists a maximum value of the fractal dimension when θ equals zero. Interestingly, we ﬁnd
that the symmetry of the aggregation pattern is broken when rewired connections are long enough,
which may be an explanation for the formation of asymmetrical fractal in nature. Then, we perform
multifractal analysis on the patterns further.

INTRODUCTION

Nonequilibrium growth models leading naturally to
self-organized fractal patterns, the structure of which
strongly depends on the dynamics of the growth pro-
cess, are of continuing interest due to their relevance for
many important ﬁelds[1]. Diﬀusion-limited -aggregation
(DLA)[2] is probably the most remarkable growth model
for pattern formation. This model generates complex
and mysterious fractal structures[3, 4], which seem to be
generated as well in natural systems in which growth is
controlled by diﬀusive, including dielectric breakdown[5],
electrochemical deposition[6], colloid aggregation[7], ﬁlm
growth[8], viscous ﬁngering[9], Laplacian ﬂow[10] etc.

In the original DLA model[2], particles released at a
point distant from the cluster execute random walks un-
til they ﬁnd a nearest neighbor site of the cluster and
irreversibly stick at this site. However, for many physical
processes, the medium is nonuniform so that the prob-
ability of jumping from site i to site j is usually not
equal to that from j to i. Moreover, except nearest-
neighboring jumps, there also exist some nonlocal jumps
through which the particle can move to a distant site
at a step. One example is the diﬀusion of adatoms on
metal surfaces, in which the long jumps play a dominat-
ing role[11, 12]. A bunch of defects or impurities in the
substrate may also play the part of the long-jump path
in the case of weak absorbate-substrate interaction[13],
which is important for the thin-ﬁlm growth, heteroge-
neous catalysis, and oxidation. Hence, the traditional
undirected regular lattice will miss important informa-
tion of medium and it is unconformity to characterize
the actual DLA process. This thus calls for the use of

network structure with directed long-range connections.
On the other hand, complex networks have recently
attracted an increasing interest among physicists[14, 15,
In particular, small-world (SW) networks, intro-
16].
duced by Watts and Strogatz[17], have been extensively
studied because they constitute an interesting attempt
to translate the complex topology of social, biological,
and physical networks into a simple model. Two dimen-
sional (2D) SW networks result from randomly rewiring
a fraction of links of a 2D regular lattice. Several dy-
namical models have recently been studied in order to
understand the eﬀect of SW topology on classical systems
such as the Ising model[18], the spread of epidemics[19],
aggregation[20], random walks[21], etc. Such models are
expected to capture the essential features of the compli-
cated processes taking place on real networks.

In this paper, we investigate the DLA process on a 2D
directed SW network, in which the directed links corre-
spond to the directed irreversibly jumps and the node is
regarded as the lattice point of the real space, respec-
tively.

II. THE MODEL

In order to construct the directed SW network, we
start from a 2D square lattice of size L × L consisting
of sites linked to their four nearest neighbors by both
outgoing and incoming links, as shown in Fig. 1. Then,
we reconnect nearest-neighbor outgoing links to a diﬀer-
ent site chosen at random with the probability

p(r) ∼ e−θr,

(1)

where r is the lattice distance between the two selected
sites and θ(θ ∈ [−1, 1]) is the clustering exponent which
characterizes the localized degree of the long-range links
in the lattice. The formula corresponds to the diﬀusiv-

of the corresponding connection.

ity represented by Arrhenius relation as usual in sur-
face science[11, 12, 13]. The reconstructing process is
repeated until m, the number of long-range rewiring con-
nections, reaches a desired value. Note that by perform-
ing this procedure every site will have exactly four ﬁxed
outgoing links and a random number of incoming links.
When the clustering exponent θ=0, we have a uniform
distribution over long-range connections, and the present
model reduces to the basic 2D directed SW network[22].
As θ → 1 (θ → 1 denotes θ tends to 1), the long-range
links of a site become more and more local in its vicinity.
In reverse, as θ → −1, the long-range rewiring outgoing
links are in favor of the farther sites. Thus, the clustering
exponent θ serves as a structural parameter controlling
the spatial length of the long-range connections.

Based on the directed 2D SW network as constructed
above, we have performed extensive numerical simula-
tions for the DLA with size of the reconstructed lat-
tice L=1000 with number of particles N =10000. Star-
ing from an immobile seed at the center of the lattice, a
particle is released at a random position where is depart
from the outer radius of the growing pattern. Then the
particle jumps along the direction from the current site
to one of its linked sites which are not occupied by the
growing pattern, with equal probability step by step. At
last, the particle irreversibly sticks at the nearest neigh-
bor site of the growing pattern in terms of the physical
distance and the pattern will grow gradually. To reduce
the eﬀect of ﬂuctuation, the calculated result is taken
average over 10 diﬀerent network realizations and 10 in-
dependent runs for each network conﬁguration for each
set of parameters (θ, m).

III. SIMULATION RESULT AND DISCUSSION

Fig 2 illustrates the patterns of DLA which exhibit rich
behaviors for diﬀerent parameters θ and m. For each θ,
it can be seen that with the increase of m the patterns of
DLA become thicker and denser, however, which is not
obvious for large θ, approximately 1. For each m, the
pattern is nearly the most dense when θ=0. While, it
gets thin and sparse when θ departs from 0 tending to 1
or −1. However, it is astonishing that the symmetry of
the aggregation pattern is markedly broken while θ < 0,
which is more obvious as θ tends to −1. To quantify
the patterns of DLA, we calculate the fractal dimensions
D0 of the DLA by box-counting method[3, 4], which are
shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that there exists a maximum
value of D0 when θ equals 0 for each m. It can be seen
that the more θ departs from 0, the more D0 decreases.
Moreover, it is found that D0 decreases more fast when
θ → 1 than θ → −1.

It is well-known that the special randomly branching,
open structure of a DLA pattern results from the eﬀects
of screening, which is manifested through the fact that
the tips of most advanced branches capture the incoming
diﬀusing particles most eﬀectively. In the present work,
due to the long-range connections, particles can jump
directly to distant sites, including the traditionally com-
pletely screened deep fjord. The nonlocal connections ef-
fectively weaken the screening eﬀect so that the pattern
of aggregate becomes compact and the fractal dimension
D0 increases with m increasing. On the other hand, the
clustering exponent θ, which restricts the spatial length
of the long-range connection, aﬀects the morphology of
the aggregate and the fractal dimension D0. As θ → 1,
the long-range links are restricted more and more local in
its vicinity so that the capacity of weakening the screen-

ing eﬀect vanishes gradually. Finally, D0 does not vary
and the morphology of the aggregate seems like the orig-
inal DLA pattern, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. When
θ=0, the spatial lengths of the long-range connections
are entire random, neither too distant nor too local and
they have a uniform distribution. Then, due to intensive
weakening for the screening eﬀect, the random particle
has the chance to appear on arbitrary sites on the un-
derlying network so that the pattern becomes thick and
compact, corresponding to increase of D0. However, as
θ → −1, the long-range links tend to the sites as distant
as possible and the irreversible jumps along directed links
break the symmetry of dynamics. Thus, small ﬂuctua-
tions are enhanced, and this instability together with the
randomness inherent in the model leads to a complex
asymmetrical behavior.

However, the fractal dimension D0 is a rough de-
scription because the pattern becomes asymmetric while
θ → −1.
So, we have performed the multifractal
analyse[23, 24] here to see more details.
It should be
noted that our measurements concern the pattern itself
other than its harmonic measure[25].

Further characterization of the DLA patterns can be
achieved by determining the generalized fractal dimen-
sions Dq. Cover the pattern with a grid of square boxes
of size ε and deﬁne Pi(ε) to be the relative portion of the
pattern in cell i, and deﬁne N (ε) to be the total number
of boxes of size ε needed to cover the whole pattern. The
relative portion Pi(ε) can be described as multifractal as:

where α is the singularity, Nα(ε) the number of small
squares of relative size ε with the same singularity, and
f (α) is the fractal dimension.

To describe quantitatively the subtle geometrical fea-
ture of the pattern, the fractal dimension f (α) can be
obtain from the partition function χq:

and its power law of ε,

where q is the moment order and τq the index of the pow
law. The generalized fractal dimension is deﬁned as:

Then, (α, f (α)) can be obtained from (q, Dq) by perform-
ing the Legendre transformation:

IV. CONCLUSION

4 shows the result. It can be seen that the curve becomes
higher and the range of singularity α becomes wider with
increasing the number of the long-range connections. In
Table I, the multifractal parameters of the distribution
are listed. The multifractal spectrum can be used to pro-
vide more information about the subtle geometrical dif-
ference, because of the αmax and αmin connecting with
the smallest probability and the largest probability of the
spatial distribution [show by Eq .(2)]. The result (Table
I) show that αmax and αmin both increase with increas-
ing m, while ∆α=αmax − αmin also increases, indicating
that the pattern becomes less irregular, less nonuniform,
and more dense. Moreover, Fig. 5 illustrates that the
multifractal curves with several value of the cluster ex-
ponent θ, -1, -0.01, 0, 0.01, 1, for a directed 2D SW lat-
tice, m=10000. More quantitative details can be seen in
Table II. It illustrates that the range of α is the broadest
and the curve is the maximal when θ=0, suggesting the
pattern is the most dense, compact and regular, which
corresponds to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 showed above.

In summarize, we have investigated the DLA process
on a nonuniform medium which is characterized by a di-
rected 2D SW lattice with two introduced parameters
(θ, m) which govern the style of the pattern. It is found
that as m increases, the aggregation pattern become
thicker and denser, which indicates the fractal dimension
increases. We also ﬁgure out that there exists a maximum
value of D0 in the case of θ = 0 for any value of m, which
implies the densest aggregation pattern corresponds to
the cases of entire randomly length of long-range con-
Interestingly,
nections, neither too long nor too local.
we ﬁnd that the symmetry of the aggregation pattern is
broken when rewired connections are long enough. The
directed long-range links contribute to the formation of
asymmetrical patterns. The random walk of the particles
along the directed links is irreversible so that the princi-
ple of detailed balance is broken. Hence, the asymmetry
of the dynamics ﬁnally results in the asymmetry patterns.
To give detailed description of the asymmetrical pattern,
we have performed multifractal analysis on the patterns.
The subtle geometrical diﬀerence among these patterns
for diﬀerent parameter value can be provided by the mul-
tifractal parameters. Although the model we have pro-
posed is very simple, the simulation results demonstrate
that it can capture most of the general features of asym-
metrical growth processes. Other than the traditional
asymmetrical factor such as gravity, magnetic ﬁeld, elec-
tric ﬁeld, etc, the asymmetrical factor of our model is the
directed link, which causes the break of dynamics sym-
metry inherent. It may be an new explanation for the
formation of asymmetrical fractal behavior in nature.

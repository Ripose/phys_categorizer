Abstract. Methods for calculating an electron density of a periodic crystal
constructed using non-orthogonal localised orbitals are discussed. We demonstrate
that an existing method based on the matrix expansion of the inverse of the overlap
matrix into a power series can only be used when the orbitals are highly localised (e.g.
ionic systems). In other cases including covalent crystals or those with an intermediate
type of chemical bonding this method may be either numerically ineﬃcient or fail
altogether. Instead, we suggest an exact and numerically eﬃcient method which can be
used for orbitals of practically arbitrary localisation. Theory is illustrated by numerical
calculations on a model system.

1. Introduction

Understanding of the electronic structure of extended systems with a local perturbation,
e.g. point defects in the crystal bulk [1] or adsorption of molecules at crystal surfaces
[2] is of fundamental importance in solid state physics and chemistry. One way of
calculating the electronic structure of the mentioned systems is based on the usage of
so-called cluster methods in which a ﬁnite fragment of an extended system (a quantum
cluster) is considered in detail while the rest of the system is treated at a lower level
of theory [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The main problem of any existing cluster
based scheme is in choosing an appropriate termination of the cluster. Usually, the
quantum cluster is surrounded by point charges [5], pseudoatoms (see, e.g.
[13]), link
atoms [8, 6, 9] or pseudopotentials [14, 15, 13].
In more sophisticated methods the
environment region is described by an electronic wavefunction which could be either
frozen [10, 16] or recalculated self-consistently with that of the quantum cluster region
[17, 6, 18, 19, 20] (a general theory of cluster embedding which comprises most of the
existing cluster schemes is considered in [3, 4]).

A rather general cluster method based on overlapping (not orthogonal) localised
orbitals is presently being developed in our laboratory. Our method which is similar in
spirit to some one-electron methods [16, 20, 19] is based on a construction of strongly
localised orbitals which are designed to represent the true electronic density of the
entire system via a combination of elementary densities associated in simple cases with
atoms, ions and/or bonds; these are called regions [21]. Our intention is to create a
rather general technique which can be valid for systems of diﬀerent chemical character,
ranging from purely ionic to strongly covalent (excluding metals). Therefore, the proper
choice of the localisation technique as well as a general method of calculating electron
density out of strongly localised non-orthogonal orbitals localised within corresponding
regions are crucial for our method to work for a wide range of systems.

The issue of calculating orbitals localised in appropriate regions for extreme cases
of strongly ionic and covalent crystals has been considered separately [21]. It is the main
objective of this paper to discuss methods of calculating the electron density of periodic
systems described via localised non-orthogonal orbitals.

It should be mentioned that the literature on this topic is quite scarce which is
probably explained by the lack of interest (until recently) to non-orthogonal (non-
canonical) molecular orbitals:
in most techniques used in the solid state community
orthogonal Bloch functions are employed in practical calculations. There are only a few
exceptions (see e.g. [22]). If a set of non-orthogonal orbitals is used, the expression for
the electron density is much more complicated since it contains an inverse of an inﬁnite
overlap matrix constructed out of the non-orthogonal orbitals of the whole system under
consideration [23].

As far as we are aware, there have only been two methods developed which enable
calculation of the electron density of a periodic system from non-orthogonal orbitals.
Both methods are based on a series expansion of the density: while the ﬁrst method

Figure 1. A schematic of a crystal division into overlapping regions. Each atom
(shown by small black circles) provides a set of atomic orbitals centred on it. Only two
neighbouring regions A (solid line) and B (dashed line) are shown which physically
represent bonds between atoms 1-2 and 2-3, respectively. All atomic orbitals centred
on atoms within each region contribute to the localised orbitals associated with this
region. It is thus seen that diﬀerent regions may have common atomic orbitals if their
borders overlap. In particular, atomic orbitals of atoms 1, 2 and 3 belong to both
indicated regions.

[22] relies on the so-called cluster expansion of the density, the second one [24, 25, 26]
is based on the power expansion of the inverse overlap matrix. In this paper we analyse
only the second of the methods in detail since the ﬁrst one is very complicated and
much more diﬃcult to implement. In section 2 we reexamine the second method from
the point of view of the correct density normalisation. Then, in section 3 we suggest an
alternative technique which does not require any series expansion. Both methods are
compared in section 4 using a very simple model system. The paper is ﬁnished with a
short discussion and conclusions in section 5.

2. Electron density of a periodic system

Let Capital letters A, B, etc. be used to indicate regions, while the corresponding small
letters a, b, etc. - localised orbitals associated with them, i.e. a
B, etc., see
Fig. 1. Each region may have several localised orbitals. We assume that the orbitals are
real. They are expanded over atomic orbitals centred only on atoms which are inside the
region border. Two localised orbitals belonging to diﬀerent regions are not orthogonal
either because they have common atomic orbitals or, if they do not, then due to their
exponential tails.

Each region A is prescribed with an even number of NA electrons. Thus, there
is a ﬁnite number nA = NA/2 of double occupied orbitals associated with the given
region A. The localised orbitals ϕAa(r) belonging to the same region are assumed
to be orthonormal; orbitals belonging to diﬀerent regions are not orthogonal, i.e the

is assumed to be not zero in general.
Note that there might be several regions within every primitive unit cell in the crystal.
Localised orbitals belonging to physically equivalent regions in diﬀerent unit cells are
obtained by appropriate lattice translations, i.e. ϕBa(r) = ϕAa(r
L), where physically
equivalent regions B and A are separated by the translation vector L.

2.1. Method based on the expansion of the inverse of the overlap matrix

Following the original prescription by L¨owdin [24], we present the overlap matrix as
S = 1 + ∆, where the matrix ∆ =

except for its elements when A = B which are all equal to zero, ∆Aa,Aa′ = 0. Then, one
can formally write a matrix expansion:

One can show (using diagonalisation of the matrix S or its expansion over the

In principle, formulae (2) and (6) allow an approximate calculation of the electron

so in order to preserve the correct normalisation of the density.

nonzero charge due to non-diagonal second order density is compensated exactly by the
diagonal third order density contribution, and so on.

This result is very useful since it allows one to balance properly a terminated
expansion for the image density so that it would correspond (in any order!)
to the
correct total charge. To do this, the ﬁnal expression for the density of any n-th order
should also include the diagonal (A = B) term from the contribution of the next order.
We stress that this fact was ignored in the previous applications of this method [25, 26].
We obtain, that the correct n

of Eqs. (10), (11) should have the form:

By employing this termination of the series, the normalisation condition (4) is satisﬁed

Thus, in order to calculate the density up to the n

also need diagonal A = B elements of ∆n+1. Then, the contributions from all density
images corresponding to all lattice translations, Eq. (2), are to be added together to
get the ﬁnal electron density.

The method described here relies on the convergence of the density expansion (6).
The better localisation of the orbitals ϕAa(r), the faster convergence and thus smaller
number of terms is needed. We shall demonstrate in section 3 that in some cases of not
very well localised orbitals one has to consider the density expansion up to a very high
order which makes the calculation extremely time-consuming. Moreover, if the orbitals
localisation becomes worse than a certain criteria (to be also discussed in section 3),
then this method fails altogether as the expansion diverges. A general and an extremely
eﬃcient technique which is not based on a perturbative expansion of any kind and can
be used for localised orbitals of practically any degree of localisation is suggested in the
next subsection.

2.2. Method based on the Fourier transform of localised orbitals

In Eq. (1) for the electron density, regions A and B are to be chosen from all unit
cells of the inﬁnite periodic system. It is convenient in this section to identify explicitly
the lattice vector for every localised orbital in its index. Therefore, in the following we
shall use letters A, B, etc. only for regions within the zeroth unit cell; in particular,
the orbital ϕAa(r) is assumed to be from the zeroth cell. Localised orbitals from other

cells are characterised by the combined index (LAa), i.e. ϕLAa(r) = ϕAa(r
a-th localised orbital from region A in the unit cell separated from the zeroth cell by
the lattice translation L.

where L and M are two lattice translations. A further transformation is possible here
since the overlap integral SLAa,MBb depends in fact only on the diﬀerence M
L of
the lattice translations. This allows expansion of the overlap integral into the Fourier
integral

SLAa,MBb =

SAa,Bb(k)e−ik(L−M)

where the summation is performed over N points k in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (BZ) and

SAa,Bb(k) =

is the corresponding Fourier image. The direct lattice summation in the last formula
is easily terminated due to (usually) exponential decay of the overlap integrals between
localised orbitals.

Using the Fourier representation of the overlap matrix, one can exactly calculate

its inverse as follows:

in direct space, one has to perform the calculation of S−1(k) for ﬁnite size matrices for
every k point necessary to sample the BZ. Substituting Eq. (18) into Eq. (15), we arrive
at the following ﬁnal expression for the electron density:

according to Eq.
(20), of every localised orbital in the primitive unit cell for every
k point. The summations in the curly brackets in Eq. (19) are ﬁnite (limited to the
orbitals within the zeroth cell only) and are thus easily performed. The extend to
which the orbitals ϕAa(r) are localised is reﬂected by the number of cells to be taken
into account while performing the lattice summations in Eqs. (17) and (20). Even for
orbitals which are not very well localised, the amount of work needed to perform these
lattice summations is incomparable with the cost of the ﬁrst method (section 2.1) which
requires including more terms in the perturbation expansion if the localisation is not
good enough.

3. Results

Atomic units are used throughout this section. The application of the two methods
considered in the previous sections is illustrated here on a simple cubic lattice model
containing a single region in every unit cell. The lattice constant a will be assumed to
be equal to 1 a.u. for simplicity. Each region is represented by a single localised orbital
in a form of a normalised s type Gaussian

By choosing various values for the exponent α, one can vary the degree of localisation
of the orbitals. Indeed, the size of the spatial extent of the orbital can be measured in
1.52α−1/2, which corresponds to e−αr2
terms of ref f =
ef f =0.1. We found this
approach more convenient in our particular case than the application of the existing
localisation criteria (see, e.g. [27, 28]).

For this model system it is possible to do some preliminary analytical estimates of
the convergence of the series (5). We know from section 2.1 that the series will converge
if all eigenvalues ∆λ of the matrix ∆ = S
It is easy to
notice that the eigenvalues are in fact given by the Fourier transforms ∆k of the matrix
∆ which is introduced much in the same way as S(k) in Eq. (17). Indeed, because
∆L,M = ∆0,M−L, one can write:

which corresponds to very diﬀuse orbitals spreading over more than six unit cells.

Similar criteria is obtained for the ovelrap integrals as well. Thus, the method we
suggest should have a much wider range of applicability than the L¨owdin method as far
α∗
as the degree of localisation of the non-orthogonal orbitals is concerned since α∗

This conclusion is also supported by our numerical calculations which we now describe.
Numerical calculations of the necessary powers of the ∆ matrix needed for the
L¨owdin method were done in the following way. Since the density is calculated in the
same point r =r′ in Eqs. (10), (11) and (14), the regions A and B in these equations
are either the same or not far away from each other. Therefore, to calculate (∆n)Aa,Bb
one can simply choose a suﬃciently big ﬁnite cluster of atoms (in fact, the cluster radius
should be at least of the order of n

When using the Fourier transform method, we employed the Monkhorst-Pack (MP)
method [29] for the k point sampling and the same cut-oﬀ distance for the direct lattice
summations in Eqs. (17) and (20) as in the previous method. In all our calculations we
used the 4x4x4 MP set which was found to be suﬃcient in all cases.
Results of our calculations for a large value of the exponent (α

shown in Fig.2. This case corresponds to strongly localised orbitals as is the case in ionic
systems such as MgO and NaCl. Overlap between orbitals is negligible and even zero
order approximation L¨owdin method, Eq. (7), was found suﬃcient to give the correct
density. Density curves for both methods are indistinguishable from each other.

here to converge the density and thus the calculation is quite time consuming.

Finally, we show in Fig. 4 the densities calculated using both methods for orbitals
which are least localised when α∗
2. The density, obtained using the Fourier
transform method, Eq. (19), is spread almost uniformly in the crystal volume and thus
may correspond to a metallic band. At the same time, the L¨owdin expansion method,
Eq. (14), does not converge at all and the density is clearly diverges.

1 > α > α∗

One can expect that the latter situation can happen only for metallic systems.
Interestingly, our calculations (not reported here) for such a realistic covalent system as
a crystalline Si show that the L¨owdin approach also fails in some cases when the orbitals
are not suﬃciently localised. Note that various degree of localisation of the orbitals can
be obtained using diﬀerent localisation techniques and diﬀerent choice of regions, see
[21] for more details.

4. Conclusions

In summary, we have considered two numerical methods which allow calculation of
the electron density of a 3D periodic system constructed via a set of non-orthogonal
localised orbitals. The ﬁrst, so-called L¨owdin, method based on the power expansion
of the inverse of the overlap matrix has been found to be eﬃcient only for strongly
localised orbitals. For an intermediate degree of orbitals localisation this method has
been found to be quite computationally demanding since many terms in the series are
to be retained. However, if orbitals are not suﬃciently localised (the exact criterion
has also been suggested), the method fails altogether and the power expansion has been
shown to be divergent.

Calculation of electron density of periodic systems...

12

Then, we have suggested another method based on the Fourier transform of the
localised orbitals which involves calculations of inverse of only ﬁnite matrices and a k
point summation over the Brillouin zone. This method is computationally much less
demanding and does not have any convergency problems. Using a simple model for the
crystal electron density represented via a set of Gaussian s type orbitals in a simple
cubic lattice (one orbital per unit cell), we have shown that our method works equally
well within a rather wide range of orbitals having diﬀerent localisation, whereas the ﬁrst
method fails for a relatively weakly localised orbitals. The application of the Fourier
transform method to realistic systems such as MgO and Si perfect crystals is published
elsewhere [21].

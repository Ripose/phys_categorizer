Development of a BEM Solver using Exact Expressions for Computing
the Inﬂuence of Singularity Distributions

S.Mukhopadhyay1, N.Majumdar1

Summary

Closed form expressions for three-dimensional potential and force ﬁeld due to
singularities distributed on a ﬁnite ﬂat surface have been used to develop a fast and
accurate BEM solver. The exact expressions have been investigated in detail and
found to be valid throughout the complete physical domain. Thus, it has been pos-
sible to precisely simulate the complicated characteristics of the potential and force
ﬁeld in the near-ﬁeld domain. The BEM solver has been used to compute the ca-
pacitance of a unit square plate and a unit cube. The obtained values have compared
well with very accurate values of the capacitances available in the literature.

Introduction

The boundary element method is based on the numerical implementation of
boundary integral equations based on the Green’s formula. In order to carry out the
implementation, the boundaries are generally segmented, and these boundary ele-
ments are endowed with distribution of singularities such as source, sink, dipoles
and vortices. The singularity strengths are obtained through the satisfaction of
boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin) which calls for the computa-
tion of the inﬂuence of the singularities at the points where the boundary conditions
are being satisﬁed. Once the singularity strengths are known, physical properties
at any point within the physical domain can be easily estimated. Thus, accurate
computation of the inﬂuence at a point in the domain of interest due to singularities
distributed on a surface is of crucial importance.

In this work, we have presented a BEM solver based on closed form expres-
sions of potential and force ﬁeld due to a uniform distribution of source on a ﬂat
surface. In order to validate the expressions, the potential and force ﬁeld in the
near-ﬁeld domain have been thoroughly investigated.
In the process, the sharp
changes and discontinuities which characterize the near-ﬁeld domain have been
easily reproduced. Since the expressions are analytic and valid for the complete
physical domain, and no approximations regarding the size or shape of the singular
surface have been made during their derivation, their application is not limited by
the proximity of other singular surfaces or their curvature. Moreover, since both
potential and force ﬁelds are evaluated using exact expressions, boundary condi-
tions of any type, namely, Dirichlet (potential), Neumann (gradient of potential) or
Robin (mixed) can be seamlessly handled.

As an application of the new solver, we have computed the capacitances of a
unit square plate and a unit cube to very high precision. These problems have been
considered to be two major unsolved problems of the electrostatic theory [1]-[5].
The capacitance values estimated by the present method have been compared with
very accurate results available in the literature (using BEM and other methods).
The comparison testiﬁes to the accuracy of the approach and the developed solver.

Theory

The expression for potential (V) at a point (X ,Y, Z) in free space due to uniform
source distributed on a rectangular ﬂat surface having corners situated at (x1, z1) and
(x2, z2) can be shown to be a multiple of

V (X ,Y, Z) =

where the value of the multiple depends upon the strength of the source and other
physical considerations. Here, it has been assumed that the origin of the coordinate
system lies on the surface plane (X Z). The closed form expression for V (X ,Y, Z) is
as follows:

that the charge densities near the edges of these bodies are much higher than those
far away from the edges. In order to minimize the errors arising out of the assump-
tion of uniform charge density on each panel, we have progressively reduced the
segment size close to the edges using a simple polynomial expression as used in
[3].

Results

In order to establish the accuracy of the exact expressions, we have compared
the potential and electric ﬁeld distributions computed using the new expressions
with those computed by assuming a varying degree of discretization of the given
surface, where each of the discrete element is assumed to have its charge concen-
trated at its centroid. The ﬂat surface has been assumed to be a square (1cm × 1cm)
and length scale up to 10µm has been resolved. The strength of the source on

comparison among results obtained by the exact expressions and those obtained by
discretizing the ﬂat surface having a single element, having 10×10 elements and
having 100×100 elements. The maximum discretization 100 × 100 discretization
apparently yields good results even close to the origin. However, oscillations in the
potential value are visible with sufﬁcient close-up. Similar remarks are true for Ey,
but for Ex (Figure2), even the highest discretization leads to signiﬁcant amount of
oscillation in the estimate. From these ﬁgures, we can also conclude that the exact
expressions reproduce the correct features of the ﬁelds even in the most difﬁcult
situations. The ﬁgures vividly represent the error incurred in modeling distributed
sources using the point analogy which is one of the most serious approximations of
the BEM.

In Table 1, we have presented a comparison of the values of capacitances for
a unit square plate and a unit cube as calculated by [1]-[5] and our estimations.

accurate results which are well within the acceptable range. Finally, in ﬁgure 3, the
variation of charge density on the top surface of the unit cube has been presented.
The sharp increase in charge density near the edges and corners is quite apparent
from the ﬁgure.

Conclusions

A fast and accurate BEM solver has been developed using exact expressions
for potential and force ﬁeld due to a uniform source distribution on a ﬂat surface.
The expressions have been validated and found to yield very accurate results in the
complete physical domain. Of special importance is their ability to reproduce the
complicated ﬁeld structure in the near-ﬁeld region. The errors incurred in assuming
discrete point sources to represent a continuous distribution have been illustrated.
Accurate estimates of the capacitance of a unit square plate and that of a unit cube
have been made using the new solver. Comparison of the obtained results with
very accurate results available in the literature has conﬁrmed the accuracy of the
approach and of the solver.

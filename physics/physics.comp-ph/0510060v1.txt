Abstract

The dynamics of the tip of the falling chain is analyzed. Results of laboratory experiments are

presented and compared with results of numerical simulations. Time dependences of the velocity

and the acceleration of the chain tip for a number of diﬀerent initial conformations of the chain

are determined. A simple analytical model of the system is also considered.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of bodies falling in a gravitational ﬁeld is so old that hardly anything new

could be expected to add to it. However, the development of the numerical simulation meth-

ods has opened for the analysis a few interesting cases, diﬃcult to analyze with analytical

means. The dynamics of a falling chain is among them.

There are a few variations of the problem. For instance, one can consider here the chain

initially gathered in a compact heap located on a table, close to one edge. The motion

starts when one of the chain ends is brought over the edge. If one assumes that the chain

leaves the heap without friction, the problem becomes tractable analytically and, as one can

demonstrate, it falls with a constant acceleration. The surprise is that the acceleration is

not g, as one would expect, but g/31.

In the variation of the falling chain problem considered here the chain is initially attached

at both ends to a horizontal support. Then, as one of the ends is released, the chain starts

falling. The case when the initial horizontal distance ∆x between the ends is small in the

comparison to the chain length L has been considered before2. We repeated the experiments

demonstrating that, in this case, the end of the chain falls with an increasing acceleration,

always greater than g; this apparently paradoxical result can be explained via analytical

calculations3. In the present paper, we provide the detailed analysis of the problem and we

extend the study to the case of large ∆x.

What happens when the initial horizontal separation ∆x of the chain ends increases,

in particular when it reaches its largest value ∆x = L, was not known. We describe in

what follows a series of laboratory experiments performed at diﬀerent horizontal separations

between the ends of the chain and compare the measurements with the results of numerical

simulations. The not studied before case, in which the initial distance between the ends of

the chain equals L (i.e. when the chain is initially maximally stretched) proves to be very

interesting.

II. THE FALL OF THE TIGHTLY FOLDED CHAIN – ANALYTICAL SOLUTION

To get an intuitive insight into what we can expect in the experiments with the falling

chain, let us consider ﬁrst the case ∆x = 0 (ﬁgure 1). We introduce here an analytically

2

tractable simpliﬁed model, in which we assume that the conformations explored by the

falling chain can be always seen as consisting of two pieces: a) the falling piece that shortens

with time; b) the almost motionless piece that elongates with time. Such a division of the

chain is possible when the initial horizontal separation of the chain ends equals zero and the

chain consists of inﬁnitely many, inﬁnitely thin segments. In this limit the chain can be seen

as a folded perfectly ﬂoppy and inﬁnitely thin continuous ﬁlament.

Initially both ends of the chain are attached to a point of support O, the vertical position

of which y = 0. Then, at time t = 0, one of the ends of the chain is released and the chain

starts falling. Figure 1 presents schematically the geometry of the system.

The dynamics of this simple model can be solved analytically by applying the law of

energy conservation3. We assume that the chain has total length L and that its mass M is

distributed uniformly along it. To simplify ﬁnal analysis of the results, we introduce a new

variable h describing the distance of the freely falling tip to its initial position. The h-axis

is thus oriented downwards, in the direction of the gravitational ﬁeld. In what follows, we

shall refer to h as the fall distance. In terms of h, the length and mass of the falling part

are given by:

The length and mass of the motionless part are:

Note that, according to the chosen reference, U(L) = 0 (i.e. the potential energy is zero

Assuming that the free end of the chain is initially located at h = 0, we may formulate the

law of energy conservation for the falling chain (remember that Tb = 0):

which in view of (4), (5), and (7) gives:

Ua(0) + Ub(0) = Ua(h) + Ta(h) + Ub(h),

Figures 2 and 3 present a comparison between the dynamics of the folded chain and the

compact body calculated for L = 1 m and the gravitational acceleration g = 9.81 m/s2.

Figure 2a shows that the velocity of the chain tip is, at any fall distance h, larger than

the velocity of the compact body. As expected (ﬁgure 2b), the acceleration of the falling

4

body is constant and equals g while that of the falling chain tip increases with time, always

exceeding g.

Comparing the motions of the falling chain and of the compact body one may ask about

the diﬀerence between the times at which they reach the same fall distance h. Figure 3

presents plots providing a clear answer to this question.

The analytical results obtained above for the simpliﬁed model of the falling chain may

be confronted with results of laboratory experiments performed on a real chain. The results

obtained for various initial conﬁgurations are the subject of the next section III.

III. LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS

We are aiming at the experimental study of the falling-chain dynamics and, more speciﬁ-

cally, at its comparison with the dynamics of a freely falling weight. In order to point out the

diﬀerences in their trajectories, we designed an experimental setup that makes it possible

to record the simultaneous motions of the two objects.

The chain consists of stainless-steel identical segments which are made from rods and

spheres attached to each other (ﬁgure 4). The total length of a segment l = (4.46

0.01)10−3 m and the diameter of the spheres φ = (3.26

0.01)10−3 m.

±
In addition, we

determine the minimum radius of curvature Rmin = (4.8

present without loading any elastic energy. We use a chain of length L = 1.022 m, which

corresponds to n = 229 segments for a total mass M = (2.08

0.01)10−2 kg.

±

The chain is tightly attached at one end to a ﬁrm support O by means of a thin thread.

See ﬁgure 5. At the other edge located at point P = (x0, y0), the chain ends with a rod (we

open and remove the last sphere) to which we tie a thin nylon wire (ﬁshing line, diameter

0.1 10−3 m). The free-falling weight, a sinker (a lead weight used for sinking ﬁshing lines) of

mass

= 10−2 kg, is then attached to the other end of the nylon wire (length about 5 cm).

M

We then make the nylon wire hang to two nails and a thin metallic wire (nickel, diameter

10−4 m) as sketched in ﬁgure 5. The whole system is adjusted so as to insure that the sinker

and the end of the chain are at the same altitude as the other end of the chain in O (y = 0).

It can be displaced horizontally in order to choose the initial horizontal separation between

the two ends of the chain. As the mass of the sinker

is about half the total mass of the

chain M, the system is almost always equilibrated (in addition, the equilibrium is helped

M

5

by the solid friction in the contact regions of the nylon wire with the nails and the metallic

wire). Thus, the initial conformation that is formed by the chain after damping of all the

oscillations, is close to the catenary curve12.

Injecting a large electric current (about 1 A) in the nickel wire results in cutting suddenly

the nylon wire at the point where they cross; the weight and the end of the chain then

simultaneously start falling freely under the action of gravity. We point out that they both

fall with a small piece of nylon wire attached to them. However, as the force that pushes

the wire against the nails vanishes, the friction force vanishes as soon as the wire is cut. In

addition, during the free fall, the pieces of wire have no eﬀect on the dynamics as the mass

of nylon is negligible in comparison to the mass of the sinker or chain.

The falling chain and weight are imaged with the help of a standard CCD video camera

(Panasonic WV-BP550/G) and the images are recorded on a video cassette recorder. The

chosen shutter speed (1/4000 s) is enough for obtaining clear images of both the chain and

sinker (ﬁgure 6). The movies are digitized afterwards by means of a Macintosh computer

equipped with a frame grabber board (Data Translation DT2255). Further analysis with an

image-processing software (NIH-Image) makes possible to recover 50 images per second from

the movies which are initially made from 25 interlaced images per second. The interlacing

allows thus to double the time resolution but results in a loss in the spatial resolution, which

is typically of about 4 mm per pixel.

The positions of both the falling chain tip and the weight at the times ti, i = 0, 1, 2, ..., at

which consecutive frames were recorded, is determined from the digitized images. To make

the discussion of the results as simple as possible, the experimentally determined positions

of the falling object will be given as the vertical h and horizontal w deviations of its current

x(t) and y(t) coordinates from their initial values (x0, y0):

w(t) = x0 −
h(t) = y0 −

x(t),

y(t),

(13)

In what follows we shall refer to the variables as the vertical, h, and horizontal, w, fall

distances. According to their deﬁnitions, in the initial stages of the falling process both

of the falling distances are positive. In all experiments y0 = 0, while x0 was changing in

four steps from 1 m to 0.25 m. Note that since the motionless end of the chain is attached

to point (0, 0), the initial horizontal separation of the chain ends ∆x = x0.

In view of

6

this equality, in the following we shall be denoting the initial separation by x0. Results of

the laboratory experiments will be confronted in section VI with results of the numerical

simulations presented in section V.

IV. THE MODEL OF THE CHAIN AND ITS EQUATIONS OF MOTION

One can deﬁne a few discrete models of the chain; below we present one of them. Its

equations of motion will be formulated for the case, in which one of the chain ends is attached

to the ﬁxed support while the other one is free. Let us note that similar models have been

considered before2,4,5.

Consider a chain moving in a gravitational ﬁeld. Several assumptions will be made to

simplify the model. First of all, we assume that the chain is constrained to move only

in the vertical plane denoted by (x, y). A chain of mass M and length L consists of n

thin cylindrical rods (in the following we shall refer to them as segments) with masses

mi = m = M/n, i = 1..n, and lengths li = l = L/n, i = 1..n. All the segments are rigid and

cannot be deformed. Consecutive segments are connected by joints with friction. Figure 7

shows the geometric representation of our model.

In order to formulate the equations of motion, generalized coordinates, which rigorously

determine the state of the system, must be speciﬁed. Following our predecessors4, we decide

to describe the system using angular coordinates indicating the inclination of the consecutive

segments with respect to the x-axis.

The position of the ﬁrst element is determined by the angle ϕ1. Similarly, the position

of the second element is described by the angle ϕ2. The global conformation of the chain

in the plane is uniquely expressed by all angles ϕi, i = 1..n. The angles are below referred

to as generalized coordinates of the system. A generalized coordinate ϕi indicates an angle

between the i-th element of a chain and the horizontal axis x.

The Cartesian coordinates of the i-th mass center (xi, yi) can be written as follows:

xi =

l cos ϕj +

l cos ϕi,

yi =

l sin ϕj +

l sin ϕi.

Using the generalized coordinates we shall derive the Lagrange equations of motion. To

(15)

start with, we shall consider the energy of the system. The motion of the chain is considered

as a combination of translational and rotational motions of its segments. Each segment has

the moment of inertia Ii = 1/12ml2, i = 1..n, calculated around the axis perpendicular

to the (x, y) plane and passing through the center of mass of the segment. Taking into

consideration the relations given in equation (14), the kinetic energy of the chain is given

To make our model more general, we introduce damping as a Rayleigh’s dissipation

where r is the dissipation coeﬃcient. We assume that the joint which connects the ﬁrst

element of the chain to the support is free of dissipation. This is equivalent to the assumption

that ˙ϕ0 = ˙ϕ1. Similar deﬁnition of dissipation was used by other authors2,5.

The motion of the falling chain is governed by the system of Lagrange equations of second

V. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

Equations of motion derived in the previous section can be integrated numerically

thus allowing one to simulate numerically the motion of the falling chain.

In pres-

ence of dissipation, the resulting system of equations becomes stiﬀ and requires spe-

ciﬁc numerical methods. We selected the RADAU5 algorithm by Hairer & Wanner

(http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html) designed for stiﬀ problems. It is based

on the implicit Runge-Kutta scheme of order ﬁve with the error estimator of order four7.

We performed a series of numerical simulations aiming to reproduce results of the exper-

iments described in section III. Thus, as the initial conﬁguration of the chain we used the

discrete catenary curve shown in ﬁgure 5 with four diﬀerent separations between the ends

of the chain: a) x0 = 1.019 m, b) x0 = 0.765 m, c) x0 = 0.510 m and d) x0 = 0.255 m iden-

tical with the separations used in the laboratory experiments. Numerical simulations were

performed with n = 229, L = 1.02 m, M = 0.0208 kg, g = 9.81 m/s2 and time t

[0, 0.5] s.

∈

The only free parameter left was thus the dissipation parameter r. Varying it we aimed

at obtaining the best agreement of the numerical results with the laboratory experiments.

To compare the results, we monitored the distance between the positions of the chain tip

found in the consecutive frames of the video recordings and the positions found in the nu-

merical simulations at the same times. The distance between laboratory and numerical data

obtained in a single experiment is deﬁned as follows:

(20)

where the N denotes the number of analyzed frames. Points (wi, hi) and ( ˆwi, ˆhi) for i = 1..N

are here the horizontal and vertical deviation from the initial position of the chain tip found

in consecutive frames of the laboratory and numerical experiments, respectively. In order

to ﬁnd the optimal value of r providing the best ﬁt for all four experiments a), b), c) and d)

we determined the total distance

∆ = δ(a) + δ(b) + δ(c) + δ(d).

(21)

∆ depends on the assumed value of r; we have found its values for r in the range from

10−6 to 10−4. Then, ∆(r) was analyzed with the use of the least-square algorithm based

on the procedure SVDFIT8. The optimal value of dissipation parameter was found to be

9

equal r = 2.163

10−5 Nms (i.e. for this one, the ∆(r) reaches its minimum value equal to

0.02510 m).

·

It seems interesting to check how this single value of r ﬁts the data obtained in each of

the four experiments; table I shows the results.

In all cases, δ are relatively small until the chain reach its minimal vertical position (it

is less then 0.004 m). It becomes much bigger after the chin tip start to raise and it has

the great inﬂuence in the value of ∆. Figure 8 presents the experimental vertical h and

horizontal w fall distances together with their numerical counterparts determined with a

much smaller time step.

Consecutive conformations of the falling chain found in the numerical simulations are

presented in ﬁgure 9. The conformations correspond to the same times at which they were

recorded in the laboratory experiments. Positions of the falling compact body are also shown

in the ﬁgure. As one can see comparing ﬁgures 6 and 9, the shapes of the experimental and

numerical conformations are almost identical.

VI. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

Quantitative analysis of the digital images recorded in the laboratory experiments pro-

vided us with sets of discrete data representing the vertical, h, and horizontal, w, fall dis-

tances of the chain tip versus time. As described above, using the data we have found the

values of the dissipation parameter at which numerical simulations ﬁt best the experimental

data (table I). As seen in ﬁgure 8 the agreement is very good. Thus, to analyze the details

of the falling chain dynamics we shall be using the data obtained at small time steps from

the numerical simulations.

First of all, let us analyze the most interesting question of the relation between the time

dependences of the vertical fall distances of the chain tip and the compact body (ﬁgure 8).

It is worth noticing that in the case a), where the initial conformation of the chain is

straight and horizontal, the vertical fall of the chain tip and the fall of the compact body

are identical up to the moment of time at which having reached its maximum vertical fall

distance the tip starts moving upwards. That it should be like that becomes clear when

one notices that during the fall the end part of the chain remains horizontal - its vertical

motion must be thus identical with the fall of the compact body. Why the end part of

10

the chain remains horizontal is also clear. This happens because the chain displays no

elasticity and no energy is stored in its bent regions. This phenomenon, noticed in the

laboratory experiments and conﬁrmed in the numerical simulations, suggests the existence

of an approximate analytical treatment. So far we have not been able to ﬁnd it.

In cases b), c) and d) the vertical fall distance of the chain tip, up to the moment of

time thmax at which vertical fall distance of the chain tip reaches its maximum value hmax, is

seen to be always ahead the vertical fall distance of the compact body. This observation is

sometimes summarized by the general statement, that the chain falls faster than a compact

body.

The next question that we shall analyze is the time dependencies of the velocity vc and the

acceleration ac of the chain tip. In order to do so we perform a series of numerical experiments

with x0 from a range [0.1, . . . , 1.02) m. All parameters of the numerical simulation are the

same as deﬁned in previous section. The plot starts at x0 = 0.1 m since because of the ﬁnite

length of the chain segments at smaller initial separations the simulated dynamics of the

chain fall becomes very complex. Similar eﬀects are observed in the laboratory experiments.

By velocity and acceleration we mean here the moduli of the velocity and acceleration

vectors. Figure 10 presents both the variables versus time. As one can see, plots of the

velocity versus time display distinct peaks. It seems interesting to check how high the peaks

are (i.e. which the maximum velocities of the chain tips are for diﬀerent initial conformations

of the chain) and at which times they are reached. It seems also interesting to ask for which

initial separation of the chain ends the velocity peak is highest. Answers to these questions

can be found out analyzing ﬁgures 11 and 12.

As well visible in ﬁgure 11a, in accordance with expectations, the peak velocity value

vmax becomes largest when the initial separation of the chain ends is smallest (i.e. when the

chain is maximally folded). On the other hand, contrary to expectations, the velocity peak
is not smallest at the maximum x0 = L initial separation but earlier, at x0 ≈

0.9040 m.

Figure 12a reveals an interesting fact. The moment of time tvmax at which the velocity

of the chain tip reaches its maximum value precedes in general the moment of time thmax

at which the chain tip reaches its maximum vertical fall distance hmax. A reverse rule is

observed only at the largest initial separations x0 of the chain ends.

It seems interesting to check how the time thmax at which the chain tip reaches its lowest

position depends on the initial separation x0 of the chain ends. The dependence is plotted

11

in ﬁgure 12a revealing that the lowest position of the chain tip is reached fastest when x0 ≈
0.5500 m (i.e. when the initial horizontal distance between the chain ends is approximately

half of its total length). thmax proves to be longest in the case when the chain is initially

straight.

The last question we asked analyzing the velocity data was the correlation between the

value of the peak velocity vmax and the time at which it is reached. This correlation is

presented it ﬁgure 13a. As we have demonstrated before, the peak of the velocity is highest

at the smallest initial separation of the chain ends, but one should not draw the conclusion

that it is thus reached in the shortest time. As seen in the ﬁgure the initial separation of the
chain ends at which the velocity peak is reached fastest amounts to about x0 ≈
See also ﬁgure 12a.

0.7000 m.

Now, let us analyze the behavior of the acceleration (ﬁgure 10b). As in the case of the

velocity plots, we also observe here clear peaks. This time, however, they are distinctly

diﬀerent in their height. Figure 11b demonstrates clearly, that the highest peak in acceler-

ation is also observed at the smallest initial separation of the chain end. Its value, at the

experimentally studied case of x0 = 0.255 m amounts to 7352 m/s2, thus it is about 40 times
larger than the value observed at x0 = 0.765 m (186.3 m/s2). That such large values of the
acceleration are realistic was demonstrated by Krehl et. al.9 who studied the dynamics of

the cracking whip. Figure 11b demonstrates that accelerations at the lowest positions of the

chain tip are not the maximum ones.

It seems interesting to check the relation between the time tvmax at which the chain

tip reaches its maximum velocity and the time thmax at which it reaches its maximum fall

distance. Figure 12a presents the relation. As one can see, except for the largest values of

the initial separation x0 the maximum velocity is reached before the chain tip reaches its

maximum fall distance.

Figure 12b presents an answer to a diﬀerently posed question. We ask about the relation

between the maximum fall distance of the chain tip hmax and the fall distance hvmax at

which the tip reaches its maximum velocity. As before one can clearly see that in general

the maximum velocity is reached before the chain reaches its maximum fall distance.

Parametric relations between a) tvmax and vmax, b) hmax and vmax found at given values

of the initial separation x0 are plotted in ﬁgures 13a and 13b. As well visible in the ﬁgures

the range of large x0 proves to be very interesting. Small changes of x0 lead here to large

12

changes of tvmax and hmax. This range of x0 needs a special attention.

VII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

A chain falling in the gravitational ﬁeld can be seen as a model of other systems such as

the cracking whip10,11. At the ﬁrst sight the above statement may seem not true, since in

the cracking whip problem, the gravitational forces are in general neglected. Let us notice,

however, that the end of the folded whip attached to the whip handle is subject to a strong

acceleration. Changing the laboratory reference frame to the non-inertial frame moving with

the end of the handle, we introduce into the system strong inertial forces equivalent to the

gravitational ones. This explains the validity of the initial remark.

Experiments we performed revealed a few new, interesting facts concerning the dynamics

of the falling chain. Let us summarize them.

1. Both the velocity and acceleration dependencies on time display distinct peaks the

height of which depends on the initial separation of the chain ends. The highest peaks

are observed for smallest initial separation. There exists an approximate, analytical

description of tightly folded chain dynamics explaining the origin of the rapid increase

of the velocity and acceleration. The theory is however unable to predict the ﬁnite

height of the peaks. (In the analytical model both the velocity and the acceleration

diverge.)

2. The velocity peak is observed to be reached fastest for initial separation x0 = 0.6863 L,

where L is the length of the chain, whereas its amplitude is smallest for x0 = 0.8863 L.

3. It seems very interesting that in the case in which the initial separation of the chain

ends is largest, the dynamics of the vertical fall of the chain tip proves to be identical

with the dynamics of the fall of a compact body. That is should be the case becomes

obvious when one notices that the end part of the chain remains horizontal during the

fall. This observation suggests the existence of an approximate analytical treatment.

It is not known yet.

4. As a rule, the time at which the chain tip reaches its maximum velocity generally

comes before the time at which it reaches its lowest vertical position. Only at the

initial separation of the chain ends larger than 0.8863 L to 0.9608 L the rule is reversed.

5. The ratio between the the largest and smallest acceleration peaks is about 166.5, which

is unexpectedly large. This may have some practical implications since at the times,

when the acceleration reaches its highest values, forces acting on the chain tip also

become very large what may lead to a damage of the chain.

Dynamics of the falling chain hides certainly a few more interesting details. The same,

even to a larger extent, concerns the dynamics of the falling rope. In the latter case the dissi-

pation plays a much more important role and elasticity becomes a crucial factor. Laboratory

and numerical experiments are waiting to be carried out.

12 A word of caution seems here necessary; from the rigorous point of view the initial conformation

formed in the experiments with chains built from a ﬁnite number of segments is not a catenary

curve. That this is the case one can see immediately considering the conformation of a chain

built from an odd number of segments whose ends are ﬁxed to points located at the same level

and separated in the horizontal direction by the length of a single segment. In such a case the

initial conformation consists of two exactly vertical pieces. This was the conformation used by

Schagerl in his laboratory experiments2

Abstract

We built a model where all spins are in interaction with each other via an antiferromagnetic

Ising Hamiltonian. The geometry of such a model is a tetrahedron placed on a hypersphere in

spaces of dimensions enclosed between 1 and 9. Due to conﬁnement and to the fact that all spins

interact which each other, our spin system exhibit frustration. The temperatures of the observed

antiferro-paramagnetic transitions are equal for all space dimensions to one of two given values

depending on the parity of the space dimension. Moreover, the order parameter < m >, i.e. the

magnetization of the system, has been also studied.

The Ising model has been widely studied to understand physical phenomena that occur

in ferro or antiferroelectric compounds, lattice gas, binary alloys etc. But, up to now, there

are very few articles on conﬁnement eﬀects [1, 2, 3, 4] on the Ising model. Understanding

the statistical mechanics of classical systems in conﬁned geometries and in systems of small

sizes is important for the future studies of nanocompounds.

This article deals of N Ising spins on a d = N −2 dimensional hypersphere. The geometry

of the spins corresponds to the following: each spin is located on the apex of the tetrahedron

corresponding to the space dimension. For the sake of conﬁnement, we assume that the space

is closed: it corresponds to a d dimensional hypersphere on which the tetrahedron is located.

This tetrahedron is located on the hypersphere so as each spin is at equal distance from each

other. Hence the curvature of the hypersphere is very large and is directly related to the

distance between spins. The number of apex of the tetrahedron is also directly related to

the dimension of space: if d is the dimension of hyperspace, the number of apex is equal to

d + 2. So, like in a 1-dimensional circle or a 2-dimensional sphere, each spin located at an

apex of the tetrahedron is at equal distance from all other spins.

Hence the Hamiltonian of such an Ising model writes:

H = − X

were si is Ising spin number i and J < 0 is the antiferromagnetic coupling. We took here

the magnetisation m =< |si| > of the assembly of spins as the order parameter in a ﬁnite

size analysis. The algorithm used here was the Wolﬀ one.

The ﬁnite size analysis [5] is a very eﬃcient way to study phase transitions by Monte-Carlo

simulations. Indeed, the notion of phase transi tion has a sense only for the thermodynamical

limit, while simulations can only be done on ﬁnite size systems. For the case of second order

phase transitions, for inﬁnite size systems with periodic boundary conditions, the correlation

length diverges at the critical temperature Tc. Here, we have a closed and ﬁnite space.

We shall deﬁne here the physical parameters necessary to the ﬁnite size analysis. The

speciﬁc heat per spin c writes:

where E is the total energy of the assembly of spins, T is the the absolute temperature, kB

is Boltzmann constant and t = T /Tc − 1 where Tc is the critical temperature. For the order

where M is the magnetization of the whole assembly of spins. We took J = 1 and kB = 1.

The results are the following.

In ﬁg.1, one can see the evolution of the speciﬁc heat c as a function of β. For low space

dimensions d < 10 it appears a smooth maximum in this graph which can be interpreted

as a transition at a critical temperature βc. It is easy to see that if the curved space has a

dimension which is odd the inverse of the critical temperature is equal to βc = 0.6; if the

hypersphere has an even space dimension the critical temperature is equal to βc = 1.25. This

is valid for all space dimensions enclosed between d = 1 and d = 9. But for high dimensions,

the evolution of the peak of c seems to ﬂatten as a function of β. Though, we have checked

that transitions always occur for N → ∞ and that the two values of βc remain. Let us

look now at ﬁg.2 which is the evolution of the order parameter < m > as a function of the

inverse temperature β = 1/kBT . For d = 2 and d = 4, < m > tends to zero when β tends

to inﬁnity. For the space dimension d = 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 even for β → ∞ the magnetization

< m > does not tend to zero.

To resume ﬁg.2 we plotted in ﬁg. 3 the values of < m > at β = 0 (squares) and at β = 5

(circles). For d = 100 we add the value of < m >= 0.156 at β = 0 and < m >= 0 at β = 5.

Geometrical frustration [7] is the explanation of the behavior of both < m > and c as a

function of β. < m > at 1/kBT = 5 is equal to zero for d = 2 and for d = 4 because the

number of antiferromagnetic spins is even in such spaces and geometrical frustration is not

too strong. Hence it is possible that the number of spins up and the number of spins down

is equal even if geometrical frustration remains because of the tetrahedral geometry. For

even space dimensions larger than 4, geometrical frustration is too strong, and the number

of spins up and down is diﬀerent leading to a non zero value of the magnetization as the

temperature goes to zero (i.e. β → ∞).

If the space dimension is even, the number of spins is also even, hence the transition from

an antiferromagnetic state to a paramagnetic one will occur at a lower temperature, i.e. at

a larger β value because each spin has d + 1 neighbours. Hence, the number of interactions
between spins is odd and < E >2 always diﬀers from < E2 > of one value of spin interaction.

For odd space dimensions, the even number of interactions between spins renders it possible

that < E2 > is close to < E >2, transitions occur at a larger temperature (i.e. lower β).

The values of the critical temperature are the same for all odd (resp. even) space dimen-

sions: the tetrahedral geometry is the same in all dimensions, no critical dimension has been

observed because of the curvature of space. Moreover, we don not observe, as the number

of spins increases, that the critical value βc tends to zero, contrarily to large systems in a

threedimensional space.

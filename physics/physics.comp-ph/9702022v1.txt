Boundary Integral Method for Stationary States of Two-Dimensional Quantum
Systems

(January 3, 1997)

The boundary integral method for calculating the stationary states of a quantum particle in
nano-devices and quantum billiards is presented in detail at an elementary level. According to the
method, wave functions inside the domain of the device or billiard are expressed in terms of line
integrals of the wave function and its normal derivative along the domain’s boundary; the respective
energy eigenvalues are obtained as the roots of Fredholm determinants. Numerical implementations
of the method are described and applied to determine the energy level statistics of billiards with
circular and stadium shapes and demonstrate the quantum mechanical characteristics of chaotic
motion. The treatment of other examples as well as the advantages and limitations of the boundary
integral method are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in nanotechnology, based on advanced crystal growth and lithographic techniques, have opened an
avenue to fabricate very small and clean electronic devices, known as nano-devices1. The charge carriers (electrons)
in such devices, through gate voltages, are conﬁned to one or two spatial dimensions. At very low temperatures,
the spatial extent of the systems along the direction of conﬁnement is comparable to the Fermi wavelength of the
electrons. Quantum dots and quantum wires are examples of quasi zero- and one-dimensional nano-devices in which
conﬁnement of the electrons occur along all three and along two spatial directions, respectively, while in the inversion
layer of narrow-gap semiconductor heterostructures the electrons are conﬁned along the direction perpendicular to
the layer. Quantum dots are relevant in the study of the Coulomb blockade phenomena2, while quantum wires are
experimental realizations of so-called Luttinger liquids3.

The motion of the electrons in a clean two-dimensional nano-device is ballistic, i.e., the electrons are scattered
mainly by the device boundaries and not by impurities. The device boundaries, due to high precision lithography,
may have arbitrary shapes and are very sharp, i.e., the electrical potential changes abruptly on atomic scales. As
a result, the behavior of such two-dimensional nano-devices, which exhibit quantum conﬁnement in one direction
and free motion of the electrons in a ﬁnite two-dimensional domain of sub-micron size, is governed by single-electron
(particle) physics, and can be described theoretically by solving the corresponding Schr¨odinger wave equation. Such
nano-devices can be considered as quantum mechanical analogue of classical billiard systems4 in which point like
particles bounce inside a two-dimensional (2D) region
delimited by the contour Γ. An idealized quantum billiard
conﬁnes a quantum particle inside a 2D inﬁnite potential well; the shape of the inﬁnite well being determined by Γ.
Quantum billiards represent models of nano-devices which play an important role in modern semiconductor
industry1. The experimental study, via STM techniques, of quantum billiards provides a new testing-ground for
the predictions of quantum mechanics1. The study of quantum billiards allows one to investigate also the quantum
signatures of classical chaos. It is known that non-integrable classical systems are chaotic, i.e., the phase space tra-
jectory of the system exhibits exponential sensitivity to the initial conditions. In the case of billiards, the chaotic
behavior is caused by the irregularities of the boundary and not by the complexity of the interaction in the system
(e.g., scattering of the particle from randomly distributed impurities). Since the concept of “phase space trajectory”
loses its meaning in quantum mechanics, one can naturally ask oneself what is the quantum mechanical analogue of
(classical) chaos, or more precisely, is there any detectable diﬀerence between the behavior of a quantum system with
chaotic- and non-chaotic classical limit, respectively.

D

The answer to these questions should be sought in the characteristics of the ﬂuctuations of the energy levels of the
quantum billiard systems5,6. Thus, in order to study the physical properties of quantum billiards one needs to ﬁnd
ﬁrst the corresponding energy spectrum by solving the time independent Schr¨odinger equation

where ˆH is the Hamiltonian of the system, V (r) is the potential energy, and ψn is the eigenfunction corresponding
to the energy eigenvalue En. In general, in (1.1) the potential V (r) does not contain the term corresponding to the
inﬁnite potential well; the eﬀect of the later is reﬂected by the “hard-wall” (i.e., Dirichlet) boundary conditions at the
billiard boundary. The spectrum is discrete and the distribution of the energy levels En is determined by the form of
the potential and by the boundary conditions.

Eq.(1.1) can be solved analytically only for very few special cases, when the system is integrable, i.e., when there
exists, besides the energy, a second conserved physical quantity. Such examples, like a quantum particle in a rect-
angular or circular inﬁnite potential well, are discussed in most of the quantum mechanics textbooks7 and in some
recent publications8, as well. However, for a generic quantum billiard the energy spectrum can be determined only
numerically, and the description of such numerical methods lacks in all widely used quantum mechanics textbooks.

The purpose of the present article is to ﬁll this gap by providing the reader with a self-contained and practical intro-
duction to a powerful numerical method, known as the Boundary Integral Method (BIM), for calculating the energy
levels of a 2D quantum system, e.g., a quantum billiard. While the BIM, sometimes also referred to as the Boundary
Element Method (BEM), has been extensively used for many years for solving diﬀerent engineering problems9,10,11,
its application for calculating energy spectra of quantum billiards has emerged only recently12,13,14,15,16.

Before we embark on our presentation of the BIM for calculating energy spectra of 2D quantum systems, let us

ﬁrst mention a few other frequently used numerical methods in the same context.

Essentially all numerical methods devised to solve the single particle Schr¨odinger equation (1.1) can be classiﬁed in
two groups. The methods belonging to the ﬁrst group assume that one readily knows a complete set of orthonormal
φm(r)
which obey the desired boundary conditions along the billiard boundary. By expanding the
functions

the Schr¨odinger equation is converted into the familiar system of homogeneous linear equations for the coeﬃcients

Here δnm is the Kronecker-delta (equal to 1 for n = m and zero otherwise), and the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian

energy eigenvalues) which satisfy the condition

= 0 .

When the billiard boundary is irregular, in general, it is impossible to ﬁnd analytical expressions for the functions
φm(r) and, therefore, the method as described fails. However, in this case one can overcome the previously mentioned
diﬃculty by either performing a coordinate transformation which renders the boundary highly regular, or by extending
the system, ﬁtting the billiard inside a rectangle or circle along which the Dirichlet boundary conditions apply. Now a
complete set of orthonormal functions can be easily found, but the price one pays in both cases is that the corresponding
Hamiltonian becomes more complicated: in the former case the simple form of the kinetic energy is altered18 while
in the latter case the potential energy is modiﬁed19, i.e., V (r) = 0 inside
(in practice a suitably
chosen large value) outside

and V (r) =

∞

D

.

The second class of numerical methods intended to calculate billiard spectra regard Eq.(1.1) as a partial diﬀerential
equation for which the general solution is formally given by (1.2) for some conveniently chosen basis functions φm(r).
The energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are determined by requiring the general solution (1.2) to obey the Dirichlet
boundary conditions along ∂
. Of course, the boundary conditions can be met only for particular values of the energy,
i.e., the energy eigenvalues. Heller20 used this method choosing as the basis functions plane waves, while a more general
and systematic implementation of this method in plane polar coordinates is described by Schmit21.

The BIM is an eﬃcient alternative to the above mentioned two classes of methods for solving numerically the
Schr¨odinger equation. We shall consider its application only for two-dimensional systems. The BIM will allow us to

2

study the quantum analogue of classical chaotic systems and reveal that chaotic behavior is reﬂected in the spacing
of the energy eigenvalues En. For this purpose, the BIM is formulated in Sec. II and is applied, in Sec. III, to the
spectra of circular, stadium and generalized stadium billiards. In Sec. IV we discuss further examples to which the
BIM can be applied. In Sec. V we present concluding remarks.

II. THE BOUNDARY INTEGRAL METHOD

with the boundary conditions for the wave functions ψn(r) speciﬁed on a closed curve Γ = ∂
which delimits the
region

D

.

The Schr¨odinger equation (1.1) is an implicit equation for En and ψn(r). This diﬀerential equation can be replaced
by an implicit integral equation which can also serve to determine En and ψn(r). For this purpose, one introduces
the Green’s function, G(r, r′; E) of the operator E

We consider now Eq.(2.3) for E = En. In this case the second term on the LHS vanishes, provided that G is ﬁnite
(i.e., has no poles) at En. A necessary (but not suﬃcient) condition is that G does not obey the same boundary
conditions as ψn. Inserting the Hamiltonian (2.1) in the RHS of Eq.(2.3) eliminates the terms containing the potential
energy V (r) and Eq.(2.3) becomes

Here ds(r) is the inﬁnitesimal arc length along Γ at r

Γ, and the normal derivative ∂ν is deﬁned through

with ν(r) representing the exterior normal unit vector to Γ at r
Γ. This is the desired integral equation which, for
nano-devices and quantum billiards, provides a simpler avenue to En and ψn(r) than the Schr¨odinger equation (1.1).
Note that Eq. (2.6) does not exhibit an explicit dependence on the potential function V (r); the eﬀect of the latter is
incorporated entirely in the Green’s function G(r, r′; E).

The eigenvalues En can be obtained by noting that existence of solutions ψn(r) implies conditions of the type (1.5).
We will adopt a similar strategy for Eq. (2.6) and consider for this purpose the limit r′
Γ. In this limit Eq.(2.6)
becomes an implicit equation for ψn(r) conﬁned solely to the boundary Γ such that a condition like (1.5) can be
postulated and exploited to determine En.

Γ in (1.5) is not trivial since both the Green’s function and its normal derivative are singular at
r = r′. However, these singularities are integrable in the sense of Cauchy’s principal value. To demonstrate this we
carry out the integration in (1.5) along a slightly altered contour Γε which avoids the singularity and then let the
altered contour approach Γ continuously. For this purpose we deﬁne Γε = ˜Γε ∪
Cε, where ˜Γε coincides with Γ, except
for a portion of arc-length 2ε centered about r′; Cε is a circular arc with center at r′ and radius ε as shown in Fig. 1,
where r′ lies inside the region delimited by Γε. We consider then the integral in (1.5) for limε→0+ Γε = Γ.
For Γε the integral has two contributions corresponding to ˜Γε and Cε. The integration along ˜Γε in the ε

In the derivation of this formula we have implicitly assumed that there is a unique tangent to Γ at r′, i.e., that the
angle θ(r′) in Fig. 1 is equal to π. Otherwise, according to Eq.(B4) in Appendix B, the RHS of (2.9) must be replaced
by (θ(r′)/2π) ψn(r′), where θ(r′) is the exterior angle between the two tangents to Γ at r′.

solved by numerical means. Once En and the corresponding ψn and ∂ν ψn on Γ are determined, the eigenfunction

Below we will demonstrate the application of the method outlined which is referred to as the Boundary Integral

Inside a billiard a particle moves freely, i.e., V

known in this case and is given by

G (r, r′; E) =

2¯h2 H (1)
as shown in Appendix A. Here k = √2mE/¯h is the so-called wave vector; the index n is dropped since we focus in the
following on a single eigenstate. We will also use the notation G (r, r′; k) for the Green’s function. Since the particle
is conﬁned to the billiard, its wave function ψ
ψn must vanish along Γ and the boundary condition (2.11) takes the
form

a condition which allows one to determine the energies En.

Even though the analytical expression of the Green’s function G is known, the Fredholm determinant (3.4) is
diﬃcult to evaluate for arbitrary billiard boundaries Γ. Below we describe more practical schemes for solving the
integral equation (3.3).

A. Methods for Solving the BIE

There are basically three diﬀerent methods for solving the BIE (2.10) for the billiard problem. Before presenting
is the
Γ is uniquely determined by s through the

these methods, let us ﬁrst parameterize the billiard boundary Γ through the arc length s

The BIE (3.3) can be recast then as

where, for brevity, we have dropped the index n which labels the eigenstates.

Method I. The most obvious (but not necessarily the most convenient) method of solution relies on the obser-
vation that both the wave function and its normal derivative (i.e., u(s)) are single-valued functions and, therefore,
u(s) must be a periodic function of s with period

Here the information about the billiard boundary Γ is contained in the s- and s′-dependence of the Green’s function
through r = r(s) and r′ = r(s′). The energy eigenvalues, expressed through k, are the solutions of the equation

det [Aij (k)] = 0

which must hold in order to render (3.8) solvable.

For an arbitrary Γ one cannot solve Eq.(3.10) exactly. However, approximate energy eigenvalues can be obtained
by truncating the inﬁnite system of linear equations (3.8) at some suitably chosen wave vector Kc. The truncation
implies that the Fourier components of u(s) which correspond to
> Kc are set equal to zero in (3.7a). In this case
the relevant part of the matrix Aij becomes ﬁnite and the corresponding determinant can be calculated numerically.
The drawback of the truncation is that the resulting energy eigenvalues expressed through k are accurate only as long
as k <
Kc. If one seeks to describe energy levels with larger k-values one needs to increase Kc which, however, leads
∼
to an increased computational eﬀort, the latter increasing rapidly with the dimension of the matrix Aij .

The calculation of the matrix elements Aij as double integrals (with an integrand which is singular at s = s′) is
computationally cumbersome and, as a result, the present method is impractical, except for the case of a circular
billiard. In this case Aij(k) is a diagonal matrix and its elements can be expressed in terms of products of Bessel and
Hankel functions as shown in Appendix C. Equation (3.10) reads then

Schr¨odinger equation. Note that because J−j(k) = (
to j

= 0 are doubly degenerate.

Method II. Rather than approximating the BIE in Fourier space one can approximate it in coordinate space,
i.e., one can solve (3.3) and not (3.8). For this purpose one proceeds in two steps. First, one approximates the
boundary Γ by a polygon with N vertices situated on Γ, as shown in Fig. 2. Denoting the segment between vertices i
N
i=1Γi, and the BIE can be approximated by a sum of integrals along the N sides
and i + 1 by Γi one can write Γ

Equation (3.13) still contains the continuous variable r′ which should be eliminated. For this purpose, let us
denote the position vector of the vertex i (see Fig.2) by si and the position vector of the middle point of Γi by

Fig. 2. The billiard boundary Γ is approximated by a polygon with N vertices.

The matrix elements Bij in (3.16) are expressed as single integrals in contrast to the matrix elements Aij deﬁned
in (3.9) which are expressed in terms of double integrals. As a result, Method II is computationally less demanding
than Method I, but has nevertheless two unfortunate features. First, the evaluation of the diagonal matrix elements
Bii requires special integration technique due to the (integrable) singularity of the Green’s function at ξ = 0. Second,
in contrast to Method I where the truncation of the exact, inﬁnite matrix Aij (deﬁned in the Fourier space) provides
us with a natural cutoﬀ wave vector Kc, in case of Method II the relationship between a similar Kc and the degree
of discretization of the boundary (in real space) is less obvious.

It should be emphasized that truncation in Fourier space is not quite equivalent to truncation (discretization of
the boundary) in real space15. As an empirical rule, if one wishes to calculate energy eigenvalues corresponding to
k <
Kc accurately, one must take at least a few (about ten) discretization points for each section of the boundary of
∼
length equal to the corresponding de Broglie wave length λ = 2π/Kc. Thus, the number of discretization points N
scales with the length

of the billiard boundary and the wave vector Kc as follows

(KcL
Accordingly, accurate calculations of energy eigenvalues corresponding to suﬃciently large k values require a large
number of discretization points N along the boundary Γ, a condition which leads to large matrices Bij and, since
these matrices are dense, to undesirable computational eﬀorts.

Method III. The most widely used method for the evaluation of billiard spectra is based on a non-singular
version of the BIE (3.3). A simple, but not entirely rigorous17, derivation of this method applies the normal derivative

B. Numerical Algorithm for Solving the BEE

Based on the computational methods introduced we have written a FORTRAN 77 program which implements the
necessary algorithmic steps using the SLATEC Common Mathematical Library24. For all three methods one can
employ a common algorithmic framework containing (i) a function det(k) which, for an input wave vector k, returns
the complex value of the determinant of the corresponding system matrix, i.e., Aij , Bij or Cij; (ii) a routine solve
which calculates approximately the roots of the equation det(k) = 0. Once the function det(k) and the corresponding
root ﬁnder solve are available one can scan the interval of k values of interest (between zero and the cut-oﬀ wave
vector Kc) to determine the zeros kn of det(k) and, hence, the energy eigenvalues En. The algorithm may fail in
practice when the separation between two consecutive eigenvalues is smaller than the scanning step ∆k, i.e., when
eigenvalues are nearly degenerate. The only way to avoid this error is to use the smallest aﬀordable ∆k.

The actual form of det(k) depends on the method chosen. In case of Method I, each matrix element Aij is given
by a two-dimensional integral [see Eq.(3.9)] with singular and oscillatory integrand such that the evaluation of det(k)
would be computationally extremely demanding and would require special integration routines. Hence, we did not
pursue an implementation of det(k) for Method I. In the case of Methods II and III the function det(k) consists of
the following three parts

9

(i) The subroutine discretize which takes as input the data necessary to deﬁne the actual form of the billiard
boundary and the number of discretization points N of the billiard boundary; discretize returns as output
the vectors ri, si (i = 1, . . . , N ) [see Fig. 2] and other useful quantities based on them, such as the matrix
∆si/∆si (i.e., the external unit vector to the
rij = ri −
boundary at ri), etc. If one does not want to change the degree of discretization of the billiard boundary during
the successive evaluations of det(k), subroutine discretize should be run only once, namely during the ﬁrst
call of the function det(k).

|

, νi = ˆz

×

(ii) The subroutine sys mat which evaluates the complex valued matrix elements Bij and Cij in case of Method II
and III, respectively. The Bij are evaluated according to Eq.(3.16) employing two SLATEC24 (more precisely
QUADPACK24) quadrature routines, namely DQAGS, for calculating the non-diagonal matrix elements, and
DQAWS, for calculating the diagonal matrix elements in which the integrand has a logarithmic singularity at
ξ = 0. The Cij are evaluated according to Eqs.(3.25-3.26) in a straightforward way. In both cases the Hankel
functions can be expressed in terms of the corresponding Bessel and Neumann functions for which the double
precision SLATEC routines DBESJ0, DBESJ1 and DBESY0, DBESY1, respectively, are called.

(iii) The function det(k) which evaluates the determinant of Bij and Cij , respectively. For this purpose one em-
ploys the SLATEC subroutines24 ZGEFA (factors a complex matrix by using Gaussian elimination) and ZGEDI
(calculates the determinant and the inverse of a complex matrix by using the factors from ZGEFA).

The function det(k) is complex-valued and, therefore, its real roots kn (the sought eigenvalues) must be simulta-
neously zeros of both real and imaginary parts of this function. Due to the ﬁnite discretization of the boundary, the
numerical solutions of the equation det(k) = 0 will be complex with a (hopefully) small imaginary part. In fact,
the magnitude of the imaginary part of the “complex eigenvalue” ˜kn can be used to characterize the accuracy of the
energy eigenvalues thus determined through the real part of ˜kn. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no public
domain subroutine which calculates automatically the roots of an arbitrary complex function of one complex variable,
and as a result one can make little or no progress at all in the endeavor of constructing a robust kn eigenvalue ﬁnder
algorithm based on the above straightforward approach. However, there is a relatively simple solution to this problem
which seems to be widely used by practitioners of the BIM11,21. One notes that the zeros of det(k) are also absolute
Re[det(k)]2 + Im[det(k)]2. Strictly
minima for the square of the absolute value of this function, i.e., of abs det(k)
speaking, the minima should assume zero values. The discretization of the boundary (or equivalently, the truncation
of the original functional determinant) introduces errors such that the numerically evaluated minima of abs det(k),
are small, but not zero; the magnitude of each minimum can be used to distinguish a real root of det(k) from a local
minimum of abs det(k). Since, numerically, it is much easier to determine the (local) minima of a real function of a
real variable than to determine the roots of a complex function of a complex variable the suggested approach is much
more convenient for our purpose. Accordingly, solve determines actually the local minima of abs det(k) by going
kmax in steps of ∆k. Once a minimum is bracketed, its actual
through a given interval of wave vectors kmin ≤
value can be calculated with any desired accuracy (for a given degree of discretization of the billiard boundary) by
employing, for example, a double precision version of the function brent from Ref. 25.

C. Numerical Results

As a test of the algorithms described in Sec. III B and their numerical implementation we determine the spectrum
of a circular billiard. In this case Method I yields the exact energy eigenvalues kn [cf. Eq.(3.12)] as the roots of the
integer Bessel functions (these roots are in fact tabulated; see, e.g., Ref. 23). The ﬁrst 18 distinct eigenvalues kn were
also determined by means of Methods II and III described in Sec. III A and are compared in Table I with the results of
Method I. In case of Method II (III) 60 (300) equally spaced discretization points of the circular boundary have been
employed. The locations of the minima of the function abs det(k) have been determined by scanning the 2
13
interval with a step ∆k = 0.004. Figure 3 illustrates the k-dependence of abs det(k), evaluated in the framework of
Method III for two diﬀerent discretizations of the boundary. An increase of the number of discretization points from
60 to 300 changes signiﬁcantly the values, but not the positions of the minima and, hence, does not aﬀect signiﬁcantly
the values kn.

Table I demonstrates that the results of both Methods II and III reproduce the exact eigenvalues to at least three
signiﬁcant digits for k <
Kc [cf. Eq.(3.18)]. In case of Method III, we have found that 300 discretization points lead
∼
to a precision of better than 1% for the 150 lowest eigenvalues of the circular billiard (with unit radius) corresponding
to k < 35. For larger k values the density of eigenvalues increases and, in order to separate adjacent minima of
abs det(k), one needs to reduce the step size ∆k. The method breaks down for k

Fig. 5. Spectral staircase N (k) for the lowest 50 (70) energy levels of the (a) circle and (b) stadium billiard.

In (a) the
dashed line corresponds to the leading semiclassical Weyl term (Sk2/4π)/2, where the extra factor of 1/2 accounts for the
double degeneracy of the energy eigenvalues with m 6= 0. The solid line is obtained by taking into account the perimeter (next
to the leading) term in the Weyl formula which for the circle billiard is given by ∆N = k/4. In (b) the solid line corresponds
to the asymptotic Weyl formula with the perimeter correction term.

The program implementing Methods II, III allows one to calculate the spectra of billiards of arbitrary shapes, for
which purpose one needs to solely alter the coordinates of the discretization points of the billiard boundary. As an
example, we choose the Bunimovich stadium billiard depicted in Fig. 4 which consist of two semi-circles (of radius
R = 1) connected by two parallel linear segments (of length L) . We seek to calculate the lowest few hundred energy
eigenvalues of both the circle and the stadium billiard.

The circle billiard constitutes an integrable system, i.e., the number of constants of motion (energy and angular
momentum) is equal to the number of degrees of freedom .
Its energy eigenstates can be classiﬁed according to
symmetry, i.e., by an orbital quantum number m, which counts the nodal lines through the center, and a principal
quantum number n, which counts the nodes of the radial wave function, i.e., the nodal circles8.
In contrast, the
stadium billiard, regardless of how small L is, constitutes a non-integrable, i.e., (strongly) chaotic, system4,27. The
study of quantum systems for which the underlying classical motion is chaotic is a relatively new and still widely open

we will content ourselves with considering without explanation one characteristic which distinguishes the spectra of
non-chaotic (e.g., of a circle billiard) and of chaotic (e.g., of a stadium billiard) quantum systems, namely the so
called (energy) level spacing distribution P (s). By deﬁnition30,31, P (s)ds is the probability that, given an energy
level at E, the nearest neighbor energy level is located in the interval ds about E + s. According to Random Matrix
Theory31,32 (RMT), applicable due to a quasi-random character of the Hamiltonian matrix, quantum systems, as
far as the statistics of their energy spectrum is concerned, in general can be classiﬁed into four universality classes,
with well deﬁned and distinct P (s) level spacing distributions30,31. Integrable systems are described by the Poisson
distribution with

Further universality classes are the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE);
classical chaotic systems which break time reversal symmetry, e.g., ellipse or stadium billiards in an external magnetic
ﬁeld, belong to the GUE, while classical chaotic systems which preserve time reversal symmetry, but break spin
rotational symmetry, e.g., a chaotic billiard in the presence of spin-orbit interaction, belong to the GSE.

Fig. 6. Histogram of the energy level spacing distribution P (s) for the (a) circle and (b) stadium billiards. In (a) the histogram
is constructed from the lowest 1,200 energy levels of the circle billiard. The solid line corresponds to the Poisson prediction
for the level spacing distribution. In (b) the lowest 600 energy levels have been used to construct the histogram. The dotted
(dashed) line represents the Poisson (GOE) prediction for P (s). The histogram is best approximated by the superposition of
4 independent GOE distributions (solid line) which correspond to the same number of distinct symmetry classes of the energy
eigenstates in a stadium billiard.

Poisson and GOE distributions are distinguished most clearly near s = 0, since Po(0) = 1 constitutes the maximum
of Po while PGOE(0) = 0 constitutes the minimum of PGOE; neighboring energy levels are likely to attract (repel)
each other in the case of integrable (chaotic) systems. We want to show that the level spacing distribution evaluated
by means of the BIM for circle and stadium billiards satisﬁes the Poisson and GOE distribution, respectively. For
this purpose one needs to calculate at least a few hundred of the lowest energy levels without actually missing any
energy levels since such misses would distort the energy level spacing distribution. The quality of the calculations,
in particular in the case of the stadium billiard, can be judged from a comparison of the obtained (energy) staircase

numerical results reported below we have chosen L = R = 1 (see Fig. 4).

Strictly speaking Eq.(3.30) is valid only in the semi-classical (E

) limit, but in practice it turns out that one
can apply Weyl’s formula even at the lower end of the energy spectrum. Our results for the staircase function
(k),
corresponding to the ﬁrst 50 (70) distinct energy levels of the circle (stadium) billiard, are presented in Fig. 5. In the
= 0
case of the circle billiard a complication arises due to the fact that all the energy levels with angular momentum m
are doubly degenerate. A simple remedy to this problem is to assume that the fraction of energy levels corresponding
to m = 0 is negligible in comparison to those with m
= 0, and that the double degeneracy can be accounted for by
dividing the RHS of Eq.(3.30) by two.

For a proper analysis of the energy level statistics we linearly scale the set of energy eigenvalues such that for the
resulting sequence the mean level spacing is uniform and equal to unity. This transformation, known as “unfolding
the spectrum”30,31, is commonly achieved by replacing the original set of eigenenergies En = k2

n by

˜En =
˜En, which ﬂuctuate
The unfolded spectrum now can be used to calculate the nearest level spacings sn = ˜En+1 −
about their mean value equal to one. Finally, a normalized histogram of the sn series gives a rough representation
of the distribution function P (s). The resulting distributions P (s) for the circle and stadium billiards are shown in
Fig. 6. In the case of the circle billiard the obtained histogram agrees very well with the expected Poisson distribution
Eq.(3.28). However, in the case of the stadium billiard the P (s) histogram does not resemble a GOE distribution, in
particular, the distribution exhibits a clear absence of level repulsion, i.e., P (s) does not vanish for s

The deviation of P (s) from a GOE distribution arises due to the fact that the stadium billiard, even though
it is chaotic, exhibits a geometrical symmetry with two symmetry planes34, as shown in Fig. 4. Accordingly, the
stationary states fall into four distinct symmetry classes, according to their parity (i.e., either odd or even) with
respect to reﬂection at the two planes. As a result, the stadium billiard spectrum is composed of four independent
family of states, each of which is expected to conform to a GOE distribution. A general expression for the level spacing
distribution function P (N )(s) corresponding to the superposition of N independent spectra with GOE statistics is

where erfc(z) is the complementary error function23. Comparison of the numerically determined P (s) with the
distribution (3.32) in Fig. 4 is indeed satisfactory. The small values of P (s) for small s-values, i.e., values below the
prediction by (3.32), are likely due to an omission of “nearly degenerate” eigenvalues by our spectrum ﬁnder routine
(see also below).

In order to check the assertion made about the symmetry classes of the energy eigenstates, and about the corre-
sponding level spacing distributions, we have calculated and analyzed also the energy spectrum of a quarter stadium,
and of the upper (horizontal) half and right (vertical) half stadium billiards, as well. The results are shown in Fig. 7.
Indeed, the P (s) histogram for the quarter stadium, which accommodates all the eigenstates with odd–odd symmetry
(see Fig. 4) conforms to a GOE distribution. On the other hand, for each of the two half stadiums, with eigenstates
which belong to two distinct symmetry classes, namely odd–odd and odd–even (even–odd) in the case of horizontal
(vertical) half stadiums, the level spacing distribution histogram is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction
of the superposition of two independent GOE’s as described by Eq.(D6) with N = 2, i.e.,

It should be noted that one can also identify the symmetry of each energy level of the stadium billiard. For this
purpose one needs the energy spectrum of the full-, quarter-, horizontal half- and vertical half stadiums. These
eigenenergies, corresponding to kn < 10, are listed in a convenient way in Table II. The odd–odd eigenvalues can

from the spectrum of the horizontal (vertical) half stadium by removing from the corresponding spectrum all the
already known odd–odd eigenvalues. Finally, all the energy levels of the full stadium which have not been accounted
for so far have even–even parity.

Inspired by the billiard stadium problem, we propose a closely related numerical experiment which tests the appear-
ance of the distribution P (N )(s) (D6). For this purpose we determine the energy levels corresponding to a deformation
of the circle billiard involving an N -fold symmetry axis. Let us consider N equidistant points Ai, i = 1, ..., N on
the unit circle, with center O. Bi is the midpoint of the arc of circle AiAi+1. We construct then points Ci and Di
OAi, respectively. The parameter ǫ controls the degree of the

can be regarded as a generalization of the stadium billiard; this is illustrated for another case, N = 5, in Fig. 8c.

For a given N , the deformed billiard possesses N symmetry planes and, therefore, the corresponding stationary
states fall into 2N distinct symmetry classes, according to their parity with respect to reﬂection at these N planes.
Proceeding as in the case of the stadium billiard, one can divide the deformed billiard into 2N elementary sectors
(see the highlighted regions in Fig. 8). The energy levels of a single sector should have an energy spectrum with
GOE statistics. This is, indeed, born out of a BEM calculation as shown by the corresponding match with a GOE
2N ) such elementary
distribution in Fig. 9a in case of a single N = 5 sector. A billiard formed by attaching n (n
sectors should exhibit a level spacing distribution given by P (n)(s), while the level spacing distribution corresponding
to the full deformed billiard should conform to P (2N )(s). The level spacing distribution of an N = 5 billiard conforms
well to the distribution P (10)(s) as seen in Fig. 9b.

In the limit N

the deformed billiard becomes a circle of radius 1 + ǫ as one can infer readily from the
construction presented in Fig. 8. The suggested billiards produce then level spacing distributions which, due to
limN→∞ P (N )(s) = Po(s), conform to a Poisson distribution. This is to be expected, of course, since this distribution
governs the spectrum of a circle billiard. One can recognize in Fig. 9b that already in the case N = 5 the level
spacing distribution resembles the Poisson distribution.

Many further billiards can be constructed in a similar way. For the case of classical systems, a family of billiards
which exhibit chaotic as well as mixed chaotic and regular motion have been studied in Ref. 35. The application of
the BEM to determine level statistics as well as wave functions for the mixed system might reveal some surprising
behavior.

In this section we wish to present two other examples in which the BIM can be applied. Both examples exhibit
the features mentioned at the end of Sec. II: (i) the corresponding Green’s function is known analytically; (ii) the
boundary condition at Γ assumes a simple form. Due to lack of space we shall only outline the BIM treatment of
these examples. The interested reader is encouraged to work out further details, including the statistical analysis of
the obtained data, in analogy to the quantum billiard case presented in the previous section.

The numerical calculation of the energy levels of a particle in a ﬁnite two-dimensional potential well proceeds
similarly as in the case of a quantum billiard. The steps to be ﬁlled in are the same as those discussed in Secs. III A,III B.
Note, however, that due to the simultaneous presence of both ψn and ∂νψn in the BIE’s, only Method II can be applied
in this particular case.

B. Quantum Billiard in a Magnetic Field

[cf.
As a second example, let us consider a charged particle conﬁned to a two-dimensional billiard with Vo → ∞
Eq.(4.1)], in the presence of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B perpendicular to the plane of motion. The Hamiltonian for
such quantum billiard in a magnetic ﬁeld is given by [cf. Eq.(2.1)]

A. Since the wave function ψn vanishes along the boundary of the billiard Γ [cf. Eq.(3.2)] the last term

or equivalently Eq.(3.20). Hence, the energy levels of a quantum billiard in a magnetic ﬁeld can be determined as
described in Sec. III. The only diﬀerence is that, instead of the free particle Green’s function, the Green’s function
of a charged particle in magnetic ﬁeld needs to be used36. Here we assume a vector potential corresponding to the

The above Green’s function can be evaluated numerically by employing the double precision SLATEC subroutines24
DGAMMA, for the function Γ(x), and DCHU, for U (a, b, x). Since the evaluation of the Green’s function and its normal
derivative (which can be expressed analytically) is very time consuming in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, it is
recommended to apply Method III for determining the energy spectrum of the system.

V. CONCLUSION

In this article we have attempted to provide a self-contained, tutorial like introduction to the Boundary Integral
Method for calculating single particle energy spectra in two-dimensional nano-devices. The BIM is suitable whenever
(i) a Green’s function G is available analytically and (ii) the boundary condition at the boundary of the device is
fairly simple. The method applies to arbitrary shapes of the boundary.

As we have shown, the BIM can be successfully applied to calculate the energy spectrum of quantum billiards,
allowing one to investigate the quantum signatures of chaos in these systems. The numerical accuracy of the BIM
strongly depends on the degree of discretization of the billiard boundary. Unfortunately, by increasing the number of
discretization points along the billiard boundary, the needed computational resources seem to increase more rapidly
than the accuracy of the calculated energy levels. Since the number of the needed discretization points along the
billiard boundary scales linearly with the cutoﬀ wave vector Kc [see Eq.(3.18)], one can conclude that, in fact, the
BIM allows one to calculate the lowest few hundred energy levels of any quantum billiard. The determination of
higher energy levels, in general, becomes computationally too expensive. Needles to say, the other existing numerical
methods for solving the Schr¨odinger equation present similar or even more stringent limitations and altogether they
perform worse than the BIM.

In conclusion, we would like to mention a few experimental conﬁrmations of the energy level ﬂuctuations of quantum
billiards described in this article. The revived interest in studying billiard spectra, in the context of quantum chaos,
has resulted in beautiful microwave experiments37,38 designed to test the theoretical predictions, based mainly on

18

6
random matrix theories. These experiments exploit the analogy between the Schr¨odinger wave equation of a quantum
particle in an inﬁnite two-dimensional potential well and the Helmholtz equation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a
resonant cavity. Thus, by microwave measurements in the range of 0-25 GHz frequency in quasi two-dimensional
cavities shaped, e.g., in the form of a quarter stadium billiard, up to few thousands eigenfrequencies were measured
in Refs. 37, 38, and found in agreement with spectra obtained by employing the BIM. Microwave measurements39,40
resulted also in the direct observation of the eigenfunctions in microwave cavities of diﬀerent shapes; the eigenfunctions
were also found to be in agreement with descriptions by means of the BIM. A very recent microwave (“photon”) billiard
measurement41 allowed for the ﬁrst time the direct experimental study of the energy level statistics in the presence
of broken time reversal symmetry; the level spacing distribution was found to conform to a GUE form.

For a ﬁnite potential energy V (r), in general, there is no simple analytical expression for the Green’s function G
and the validity of Eq.(2.9) is questionable. However, by assuming on physical grounds that V (r) is ﬁnite for all
r
, one can realize that the result (2.9) holds in this case too. Indeed, when ε is small the potential energy is
almost constant in the vicinity of r′ (point A in Fig.1) and, therefore, one can approximate the Green’s function with
0.

But G for a constant potential energy has essentially the same form as for a free particle [Eq.(3.1)] and, therefore, it
has the same type of logarithmic singularity at r = r′. Since the actual value of the integral (2.9) is determined solely
by the type of this singularity of the Green’s function one may conclude that the result derived in this appendix holds
in general.

Since exp(ijs), j = 0,

coeﬃcients should be all equal to zero. The eigenenergies correspond to those k values for which non trivial uj’s
exist. Recalling that the Hankel functions have no real roots, one obtains the same eigenenergy equation (3.12) as in

APPENDIX D: SUPERPOSITION OF N INDEPENDENT SPECTRA WITH GOE LEVEL SPACING
DISTRIBUTION

In this Appendix we derive the level spacing distribution function P (N )(s) corresponding to the superposition of N

independent spectra with GOE level spacing distribution. In general, P (s) can be expressed30

where

(s), the so-called gap probability, gives the probability that the energy interval (E, E + s) lacks energy levels.

Let us consider N independent (i.e., uncorrelated) sets of energy levels with GOE level spacing distribution

The probability density (D2) is normalized as follows

Note that the above method of calculating P (s) is rather general and applies also when the independent spectra
have arbitrary statistics. For example, one could calculate the level spacing distribution of the superposition of an
arbitrary number of spectra, some of them obeying Poisson statistics and the rest GOE statistics. For further details
the reader is referred to Refs. 31, 32.

The exchange-correlation energy in Kohn-Sham density functional theory is expressed as a func-
tional of the electronic density and the Kohn-Sham orbitals. An alternative to Kohn-Sham theory
is to express the energy as a functional of the reduced ﬁrst-order density matrix or equivalently the
natural orbitals. In the former approach the unknown part of the functional contains both a kinetic
and a potential contribution whereas in the latter approach it contains only a potential energy and
consequently has simpler scaling properties. We present an approximate, simple and parameter-free
functional of the natural orbitals, based solely on scaling arguments and the near satisfaction of a
sum rule. Our tests on atoms show that it yields on average more accurate energies and charge den-
sities than the Hartree Fock method, the local density approximation and the generalized gradient
approximations.

The solution of the quantum mechanical many-electron
problem is one of the central problems of physics. A great
number of schemes that approximate the intractable
many-electron Schr¨odinger equation have been devised to
attack this problem. Most of them map the many-body
problem to a self-consistent one-particle problem. Proba-
bly the most popular method at present is Density Func-
tional Theory [1] (DFT) especially when employed with
the Generalized Gradient Approximation [2,3] (GGA)
for the exchange-correlation energy. DFT is based on
the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem [4] which asserts that the
electronic charge density completely determines a many-
electron system and that in particular the total energy is
a functional of the charge density. Attempts to construct
such a functional for the total energy have not been very
successful because of the strong non-locality of the ki-
netic energy term. The Kohn-Sham scheme [5] where the
main part of the kinetic energy, the single particle kinetic
energy, is calculated by solving one-particle Schr¨odinger
equations circumvented this problem. The diﬀerence of
the one-particle kinetic energy and the many-body ki-
netic energy is a component of the unknown exchange-
correlation functional. The exchange-correlation func-
tional is thus a sum of a kinetic energy contribution and
a potential energy contribution and partly for this rea-
son it does not scale homogeneously [6] under a uniform
spatial scaling of the charge density.

It has been known for a long time, that one can also
construct a total energy functional using the ﬁrst-order
reduced density matrix. Several discussions of the ex-
istence and the properties of such a functional can be
found in the literature [7,9–11]. However in spite of the
enthusiasm expressed towards this approach in the early
papers, no explicit functional has ever been constructed
and tested on real physical systems. An important ad-

1

vantage of this approach is that one employs an exact
expression for the many-body kinetic energy. Only the
small non Hartree-Fock-like part of the electronic repul-
sion is an unknown functional [9]. We propose in this
paper an explicit form of such a functional in terms of
the natural orbitals. The high accuracy of this Natural
Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT) is then established
by applying it to several atoms and ions.

Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy review some basic facts about re-
duced density matrices [12,13]. If Ψ is an arbitrary trial
wave function of an N -electron system, the ﬁrst and sec-
ond order reduced density matrices, γ1 and γ2 are

The variables xi contain both the position coordinates

nates and summation of the discrete spin part.

The electronic charge density ρ(r) is obtained from the
diagonal part of the ﬁrst-order reduced density matrix,

ρ(x1) = γ1(x1, x1); ρ(r1) =

ρ(x1).

In order to construct a natural orbital functional, it
remains to ﬁnd an approximation for σ in terms of the
natural orbitals and occupation numbers. In the follow-
ing, we assume the standard case of a Hamiltonian that
is not spin dependent. Each natural orbital can then be
chosen to be either purely spin up or spin down and can
be labeled by an orbital index i and a spin index si.

The approximate σ we propose has the following form:

In principle an inﬁnite number of natural orbitals must
be included. For the systems studied in Table I at
most 38 orbitals were needed to obtain good convergence.
The occupation numbers of the core natural orbitals are
restricted to be unity, while the remaining occupation
numbers are allowed to vary freely and are found to

lie always between zero and one, which is a necessary
and suﬃcient condition for the density matrix to be N-
representable [13].

We now discuss the properties of this functional.
Homogeneous scaling of exchange-correlation energy:
The exact exchange-correlation energy in ﬁrst-order den-
sity matrix functional theory diﬀers from the exact
exchange-correlation energy in density functional theory
amd scales homogeneously [9] under a uniform scaling
of the density matrix. The exchange-correlation energy,
deduced from Eqs. (6) and (7), exhibits this property.

No orbital self-interactions:

In the case where one has fractional occupation numbers
one has to distinguish between orbital self-interactions
and electron self-interactions. Our functional is free of or-
bital self-interactions because the sum in Eq. 7 excludes
terms with i = j, but it is not perfectly electron self-
interaction free. The total energy for H is therefore not
correct (Table I). The functional has however a much
better cancellation of electron self-interactions than den-
sity functionals, as can be seen from the fact that nega-
tive ions are stable (Table I). In contrast LDA and GGA
bind only a fraction of an additional electron.
Sum rule for second order reduced density:

The density and the number of electron pairs are ob-
tained by integrating the exact second order reduced den-
sity matrix.

Our approximation for the second order reduced density
matrix would satisfy these equations if the sums in Eq. 7
also included the i = j terms. We omit these terms be-
cause we ﬁnd that an exact cancellation of the orbital
self-interactions is more important than an exact fulﬁll-
ment of the sum rules in Eqs. (10) and (11). The sum
ni),
rules are violated only by terms of the order of ni(1
which for most systems are small since all the occupation
numbers are close to either zero or one.

−

The functional coincides with the Hartree Fock (HF)
functional if one imposes the additional constraint, that
the occupations numbers all be 1 or 0.

No dissociation problems:

Even though the functional contains terms which are
similar to the HF functional, it should not suﬀer from
some well established deﬁciencies of the spin restricted
HF functional such as the dissociation problem of the H2
molecule. As one separates the two H atoms, the large
occupation numbers in the up- and down-spin σg molec-
ular orbital get redistributed to the up-spin 1s atomic
orbital on one atom and the down-spin 1s atomic orbital
on the other. In the inﬁnitely separated limit each atom

Hartree Fock as limiting case:

has non-zero occupation numbers in either only the up-
spin or only the down-spin orbitals. Consequently the
energy is the sum of the energies of the individual atoms.

Transition states:

In molecular calculations the eﬀect of this functional
is expected to be particularly signiﬁcant for transitions
states, which are poorly described by LDA and HF. At
transition states more than one determinant is needed for
an adequate description, and releasing the HF constraint
of integer occupation numbers is therefore important.

Orbital-dependent “potentials”:

The weakly-occupied natural orbitals are localized in the
same region of space as the highest strongly-occupied
natural orbitals. This is in contrast to the unoccu-
pied Kohn-Sham and Hartree-Fock orbitals which have
a larger extent than the occupied ones. The manner in
which this comes about can be seen from Eq. 8 which
has an orbital-dependent “potential”. One term in the
potential goes as √ni – an enhancement by a factor of
1/√ni relative to Hartree-Fock – which has the conse-
quence that weakly-occupied natural orbitals see a more
strongly negative potential than do the strongly-occupied
orbitals, thereby helping to localize the weakly-occupied
natural orbitals.

Chemical potential:

.

All natural orbitals with fractional occupation ni share
the same chemical potential [10], µ = ∂E
∂ni

Discontinuity of the exchange-correlation potential:
As one adds fractions of an electron, one ﬁnds, at occu-
pation numbers close to integers, a rapid change in the
eﬀective potential felt by all the electrons, which is due to
the jump in the chemical potential. This quasi discontin-
uous eﬀect might mimic the discontinuity [16,15] in the
DFT exchange correlation potential, an eﬀect missing in
the LDA and GGA functionals.

Correct description of correlations of diﬀerent origin:
In a 1/Z expansion of the energy, the correlation energy
of the two-electron series can be described by nondegen-
erate perturbation theory while the four-electron series
requires degenerate perturbation theory. Consequently
the correlation energy of the two-electron series tends to
a constant with increasing Z, whereas it increases lin-
early in the four-electron case. Both trends are correctly
captured by the NOFT functional as shown in Table II.
Any GGA functional can at best describe only one of the
trends.

Correct qualitative behavior of natural occupation

numbers:
As seen from Table III, the NOFT occupation numbers
may diﬀer considerably from the ones obtained from con-
ﬁguration interaction calculations, but the main trends
are correctly reproduced. In particular, the trend in the
occupation numbers of the strongly occupied 1s orbitals,
going from He to H− is correct.

Accurate results:

In Table I, we give a compilation of the errors in the

−

(ρex(r)

total energy ∆E and the errors in the charge densities
∆ρ. The charge density errors are deﬁned by (∆ρ)2 =
ρ(r))2dr, with the “exact” charge densities
ρex obtained from accurate quantum Monte Carlo calcu-
R
lations [18]. Both total energies and charge densities are
improved on average compared to HF and DFT calcula-
tions. In particular the improvements over the HF densi-
ties are impressive since they are known to be rather ac-
curate. The GGA schemes yield improved total energies
compared to both LDA and HF while the GGA densities
are better than those from LDA but not as good as those
from HF. In the case of C, the error in the spherically av-
eraged charge density is quoted. The “exact” total ener-
gies were obtained from Ref. [17]. The LDA energies and
densities were obtained by a standard spherical atomic
program. As a representative of a GGA functional we
have chosen the recent PBE [2] functional. All the HF
and NOFT calculations were done with a non-spherical
atomic program developed by the authors. All calcula-
tions were done in a spin restricted scheme. In the case of
C the correct non-spherical 3P ground state was chosen.
The QCISD conﬁguration interaction calculations were
done with the Gaussian 94 software package [20] using
an accurate 6-311G++G(3df,2p) basis set. Since we do
no molecular calculations, we monitor a third quantity
the transferability error ∆τ , to make predictions about
the behavior of this scheme in molecular and solid state
calculations. Molecular geometries are determined via
the Hellmann-Feynman theorem by the charge densities
in the valence region. The external potential in the va-
lence region is modiﬁed in a molecule compared to the
atomic case. We simulated this modiﬁcation by adding
a conﬁning parabolic potential to the atom. The change
in the total energy due to the variation of this parabolic
potential is again given by the Hellmann-Feynman theo-
rem and we deﬁne the transferability error ∆τ therefore
as ∆τ =

ρex(r)) r2dr.

In conclusion, we have made a ﬁrst attempt at con-
structing an approximate total energy functional of the
ﬁrst-order reduced density matrix. We have listed and
discussed the properties that make it superior to the HF
and approximate DFT functionals and have also shown
that it yields better energies and densities than HF and
current DFT schemes. The high accuracy of quantities
related to the charge density leads one to expect that
this new functional will give accurate molecular geome-
tries as well as accurate energy diﬀerences between dif-
ferent geometric conﬁgurations. In view of the fact that
the functional is parameter free and based on a few sim-
ple considerations, we think this to be a remarkable suc-
cess. It is likely that it will be possible to construct even
better functionals along these lines. The essential point
in this work is that we have used natural orbitals in-
stead of Kohn Sham orbitals. We believe that this is es-
sential to obtain accurate densities and kinetic energies.

With the exception of the complication of an orbital-
dependent potential, the computational procedure neces-
sary to solve the NOFT equations is analogous to other
self-consistent one-particle schemes and thus computa-
tionally much cheaper than quantum chemistry methods
based on conﬁguration interaction related schemes.

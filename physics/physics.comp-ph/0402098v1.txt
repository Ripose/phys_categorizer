SUMMARY

A ﬁnite diﬀerence upwind discretization scheme in two dimensions is presented in detail
for
the transient simulation of the highly coupled non-linear partial diﬀerential equations of the full
hydrodynamic model, providing thereby a practical engineering tool for improved charge carrier
transport simulations at high electric ﬁelds and frequencies. The discretization scheme preserves
the conservation and transportive properties of the equations. The hydrodynamic model is able to
describe inertia eﬀects which play an increasing role in diﬀerent ﬁelds of micro- and optoelectronics,
where simpliﬁed charge transport models like the drift-diﬀusion model and the energy balance model
are no longer applicable. Results of extensive numerical simulations are shown for a two-dimensional
MESFET device. A comparison of the hydrodynamic model to the commonly used energy balance
model is given and the accuracy of the results is discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION

There is a growing interest in extended charge transport models for semiconductor devices.
Our paper emerges from the the fact that today’s submicron semiconductor devices like e.g.
MESFETs and HEMTs are operated under strong electric ﬁelds and at high frequencies.
Information transmission using an electromagnetic wave at very high frequencies will have a
direct impact on how we design active and passive components in diﬀerent ﬁelds of micro-
and optoelectronics. In such cases, quasi-static semiconductor device models like the energy
balance model (EBM) are no longer adequate. Especially in GaAs and related materials used
for high-speed device design, inertia eﬀects play an important role since the momentum and
energy relaxation times of the electron gas are close to the picosecond range.

The most elaborate and practicable approach for the description of charge transport in
semiconductors used for device simulation would be the Monte Carlo (MC) method [1].
The advantage of this technique is a complete picture of carrier dynamics with reference
to microscopic material parameters, e.g. eﬀective masses and scattering parameters. But the
method must be still considered as very time consuming and hence too uneconomical to be
used by device designers.

Besides the simplest concept which is the traditional drift-diﬀusion model (DDM), there
is a much more rigorous approach to the problem, namely the so-called hydrodynamic model
(HDM). A simpliﬁed version of the HDM is the EBM, which is implemented in most of today’s
commercial semiconductor device simulators. The HDM makes use of electron temperature for
the description of charge transport and takes inertia eﬀects into account as well. Starting
from the Boltzmann equation, Blotekjaer [2] and many others presented a derivation of such
equations under the assumption of parabolic band structures. Especially for silicon, satisfactory
results were obtained this way [3]. But the results have often been unsatisfactory when MC
models based on a nonparabolic structure were compared to HDM results based on an empirical
choice of model parameters. Therefore, it is quite natural to improve the HDM by incorporating
energy-dependent relaxation times and eﬀective masses obtained from MC bulk simulations
[4, 5]. This is a strategy we pursue in this paper.

In the ﬁrst part of this work, we give a short deﬁnition of the hydrodynamic model for GaAs.
We emphasize that a thorough analysis of the physical features of the charge carrier transport
models is the basis for a clear understanding of their limits of applicability. Then we give a
simple discretization scheme for the full hydrodynamic model in two dimensions, which will be
applied to a GaAs MESFET structure in the last part. There, we compare the HDM results
also to results obtained from the simpler EBM, and we investigate the inﬂuence of the grid
resolution on the results.

2. THE HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL FOR GaAs FETs

2.1. Deﬁnition of the model

is based on the single-gas hydrodynamic equations. This is a
Our active device model
simpliﬁcation of the two-valley hydrodynamic equations, since strictly speaking, in GaAs and
other semiconductors with similar band structure like InP, there exists an electron gas with
diﬀerent thermal distribution function for each conduction band valley (i.e. the Γ- and L-
valleys). The equations for each valley are, however, coupled through collision terms since
electrons can scatter between two diﬀerent valleys. The corresponding relaxation rates may
be of the order of a picosecond and are therefore relatively large. This is the main drawback
of the single-gas approximation, and it would be desirable to implement at least a two-valley
hydrodynamic model. Reliable extensive two-valley simulations have been performed only for
the one-dimensional case so far due to the large amount of equations and parameters involved
in such a model. A hydrodynamic two-valley simulation of GaAs MESFETs is the subject of
one of our forthcoming papers. The HDM equations consist of the continuity equation

where n, ω (ω = ω/n), and ~v are the electron density, the electron energy density (average

electron drift velocity and ~p = m∗n~v the momentum density. Corresponding equations are
valid for the y- (and z-) components. T is the electron temperature, e > 0 the elemental

electrons, where TL is the lattice temperature. The EBM uses only a simpliﬁed energy balance

The momentum relaxation time τp(ω) is related to the mobility of the electrons via µ(ω) =
(e/m∗(ω))τp(ω), and the energy relaxation time τω(ω) describes the exchange of energy
between the heated electron gas and the lattice. τp and τω and the eﬀective electron mass m∗
are assumed to be functions of the mean electron energy. We performed steady-state Monte
Carlo simulations in order to get the correct values for these parameters.

The reason for the double index of the electron mass will soon become clear. The last term in
eq. (8) accounts for the fact that a minimum energy ∆EΓL = 0.29 eV is necessary to excite an
electron to an upper conduction band. βL is the relative fraction of electrons in the L-band for
the stationary homogeneous case. The term βL(ω)∆EΓL is often neglected in the literature,
but this may lead to an overestimation of the electron temperature of more than 1000 K at
high energies.

2.2. Remarks on the single gas approximation

We point out again the important fact that we are using a single-gas approximation for the
hydrodynamic model. This means that the closing relation eq. (8) is a crude approximation
which allows the calculation of the electron temperature from the total electron energy and
electron drift velocity. Some authors neglect also the inﬂuence of the electron velocity on the
temperature [5, 6] by directly relating the electron temperature T to the average electron
energy ω from stationary MC simulations.

The transition from the two-gas model to the single-gas approximation has to be done
carefully; therefore, we present here a short discussion of the problem which is usually not
mentioned in the literature. We assume parabolic Γ− and L−valleys for the sake of brevity,
but in our simulations, we took the eﬀect of the non-parabolicity of the energy bands into
account by using the Kane model [7], which generalizes the parabolic relation for the electron
energy Ek and electron crystal momentum ~k

with the non-parabolicity coeﬃcient α which has diﬀerent values for the diﬀerent energy bands.
meﬀ is the eﬀective electron mass at the bottom of the energy band under consideration. Very
often, an energy-dependent electron mass is deﬁned via

i.e. the electron mass increases with growing energy. The electron mass mE must not be
confused with the energy-dependent electron mass used in the hydrodynamic model. In that
case, the masses are a kind of average masses depending on the average electron energy.

There is even a further aspect related to the notion of the electron mass. The crystal velocity

of an electron is given for spherical bands by

which implies that crystal velocity v and crystal momentum p = ~k are related by

p = mpv

1 + 4αγ(k)meﬀ ,

i.e. a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the energy-dependent electron mass applies if the electron velocity
is calculated from the crystal momentum.

p

In the single particle two-band MC simulations, the random walk of an electron inside the
semiconductor material is monitored over a suﬃciently long time. As a result, the probability
βΓ that an electron resides in the Γ−valley is obtained as a function of the applied constant
homogeneous electric ﬁeld E or as a function of the mean electron energy ω, and the probability
of ﬁnding the electron in an upper L−valley is then βL = 1 − βΓ. Also the values for for the
average electron velocities vΓ and vL in the diﬀerent valleys are obtained as well. Then it is
reasonable to deﬁne the average electron velocity by

v = βΓvΓ + βLvL .

The average electron momentum p is given by

∗

p = m

v = mΓβΓvΓ + mLβLvL ,

hence the (energy-dependent) electron mass which must be used in the hydrodynamic model
in order to relate average electron velocity and electron momentum is calculated from

mΓβΓvΓ + mLβLvL
βΓvΓ + βLvL
But we suggest that a diﬀerent mass m∗∗(ω) should be used for the calculation of the average
kinetic electron energy in eq. (8). We identify

m∗ and m∗∗ are not distinguished in the literature. It is tempting to use a naive deﬁnition for
the electron mass

m = βΓmΓ + βLmL .

It is interesting that data in the literature for the energy-dependent electron mass are usually
in better agreement with this deﬁnition. It is clear that the HDM is still an approximative
description of charge carrier dynamics inside a semiconductor, and the diﬀerent assumptions
which are inherent in the derivation of the model may already cause larger errors in the
simulation results than using only one mass. Therefore we do not claim that our discussion
leads to improved simulation results, but it rather shows the limits of the frequently used
model and points out that it is mandatory to maintain always a highest possible degree of
consistency.

Figure 1. Energy-dependent electron masses used in the hydrodynamic simulations.

Nd = 1014cm−3. The results from MC simulations were smoothed by a polynomial ﬁt and
transferred afterwards into the hydrodynamic simulation program. We used mΓ = 0.067m0
and mL = 0.35m0. For high energies when nearly all electrons are in the upper bands, the
electron mass even exceeds the value mL due to the non-parabolicity of the energy bands.

Figure 2 shows the average energy ω of an electron in a constant homogeneous electric ﬁeld
E for GaAs. For each data point, the electron was scattered one million times (including so-
called self-scattering), therefore the resulting curve is already quite smooth. It is clear that
MC simulations deliver no data for average electron energies below ω < ω0 = 38 meV, since
the mean electron energy ω has this value if no electric ﬁeld is applied to the crystal, and ω
grows for increasing electric ﬁeld. This is no major problem, since the low energy region is of
minor importance for the hydrodynamic simulation and the necessary data can be obtained
from theoretical considerations [4].

In order to complete the set of data which is necessary for hydrodynamic simulations, the
electron velocity and energy relaxation times are depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 for doping densities
Nd = 1014cm−3 and 2 · 1017cm−3. The characteristic shape of the velocity curve can be
explained by the fact that at high energies the electrons jump into the L−bands where the
electrons have a lower mobility than in the Γ−band.

Finally, we need an expression for the thermal conductivity of the electron gas, which is

inﬂuence the simulation results very much if r remains within a reasonable range, but Baccarani
and Wordeman point out in [8] that neglecting thermal conductivity completely can lead to
nonphysical results and mathematical instability. Although their work is directed to Si, their
remarks should be equally valid for GaAs since the equations have a similar form in both cases.
In our simulations, we have chosen r = −2.

2.3. The energy balance model

The EBM is obtained as a simpliﬁcation of the full HDM by neglecting the convective terms
of the momentum balance equation (3). Additionally, the energy balance equation (4) is
simpliﬁed by the assumption that the time derivative of the mean electron energy ∂ω/∂t
is small compared to the other terms and that the kinetic part in ω can also be neglected, i.e.

The continuity equation and the Poisson equation remain of course unchanged in the EBM.
Neglecting the time derivative of the current density is equivalent to the assumption that the
electron momentum is able to adjust itself to a change in the electric ﬁeld within a very short
time. While this assumption is justiﬁed for relatively long-gated ﬁeld eﬀect transistors, it needs
to be investigated for short-gate cases.

Setting the electron temperature T equal to the (constant) temperature of the semiconductor
material TL leads to the drift-diﬀusion model. Such a simpliﬁcation is clearly not justiﬁed for
the case studied in this paper (see also [9]).

3. NUMERICAL ASPECTS

3.1. Discretization of the equations

Today, many elaborate discretization methods are available for the DDM equations or EBM
equations. The well-known Scharfetter-Gummel method [10] for the DDM makes use of the fact
that the current density is a slowly varying quantity. The current equation is then solved exactly
under the assumption of a constant current density over a discretization cell, which leads to
an improved expression for the current density than it is given by simple central diﬀerences. It
is therefore possible to implement physical arguments into the discretization method. Similar
techniques have been worked out for the EBM [11]. But due to the complexity of the HDM
equations, no satisfactory discretization methods which include physical input are available
for this case.

Therefore, we developed a shock-capturing upwind discretization method, which has the
advantage of being simple and reliable. For our purposes, it was suﬃcient to use a homogeneous
mesh and a constant time step. But the method can be generalized to the non-homogeneous
case.

Time discretization is done for all equations by forward Euler diﬀerencing,

i.e. the
discretization scheme is fully explicit. The discretization is always written down only for the
x-component of vectorial quantities in the sequel, since the corresponding expressions for y-
components are then easy to derive.

The constant timestep ∆t used in our simulations was typically of the order of a few tenths

of a femtosecond, and quantities at time T = t∆t carry an upper integer index t.

i,j, T t

The rectangular simulated region of the MESFET gets discretized into Nx × Ny rectangular
cells Ci,j of equal size ∆x × ∆y = (lx/Nx) × (ly/Ny). Scalar quantities at timestep t like
nt
i,j, ωt
i,j, where i = 1, ...Nx and j = 1, ...Ny are located at the center of the cells,
whereas vectorial quantities like e.g. the electric ﬁeld components Et
y;i,j+1/2 or the
velocity components vt
y;i,j+1/2 are always calculated ﬁrst at midpoints between the
scalar quantities.

but a diﬀerent deﬁnition applies to e.g. jx;i,j, as we shall see.

The fundamental variables that we will have to compute at each timestep are ni,j, φi,j,
ωi,j (or Ti,j), jx;i+1/2,j and jy;i,j+1/2, always respecting the imposed boundary conditions. All
other variables used in the sequel should be considered as derived quantities.

i.e. particles that leave cell (i, j) in x-direction enter cell (i + 1, j) and analogously for the
y-direction; therefore, the total number of electrons inside the MESFET can only be changed
at the boundary of the simulation region (mainly at the contacts).

The Poisson equation, which is coupled to the hydrodynamic equations only through the
particle density n, can be solved by any convenient method which is fast enough, since the
computational eﬀort should be kept as small as possible. Therefore, we used a multigrid method
to perform this task. Fortunately, the Poisson equation has not to be solved at each timestep.
Since the relaxation times of GaAs are of the order of some tenths of a picosecond, a timestep
of about ten femtoseconds is fully suﬃcient for the update of the electric ﬁeld. Fortunately,
the stability of the discretization scheme is not aﬀected that way, and allows an enormous
reduction of the computational costs.

3.2. Boundary conditions

For the basic quantities n, φ and ω we imposed Dirichlet boundary conditions at each timestep
at the contacts, e.g. the potential φ at the source and the drain was ﬁxed by the applied voltage

φ|s,d = Vs,d.

(41)

Analogously, we assumed charge neutral contacts at the source and the drain, such that the
charge carrier density was given there by the ﬁxed doping density. The gate contact was
modelled by assuming a Schottky barrier height of 0.8 V. For further details concerning the
metal-semiconductor contact modelling we refer to standard textbooks [1]. As far as the energy
density is concerned, we imposed the boundary conditions directly on the electron temperature
by assuming that the electron gas is in thermal equilibrium with the drain/source contacts.

The artiﬁcial boundaries were modelled using von Neumann type boundary conditions. We
present an explicit example in order to illustrate this point. We assume that the discrete values
of the electron density at the MESFET boundary between the source and the gate (see Fig.
5) are given by n(i1,1), ...n(i2,1): The ﬁrst index denotes the horizontal direction, whereas the
second index starts with 1 at the top of the MESFET. Then, after each update of the density
according to eq. (40), we enforce

n(i1,1), ...n(i2,1) = n(i1,2), ...n(i2,2),

(42)

corresponding to the von Neumann condition that the normal component of the electron
density vanishes at the speciﬁed boundaries.

As mentioned above, we used a multigrid algorithm to calculate the electric potential. Also
there, the mixed Dirichlet/von Neumann boundary conditions were imposed on the subgrids
at each intermediate step of the calculations. A FORTRAN90 program which calculates the
potential by a multigrid algorithm can be obtained from the ﬁrst author’s address.

4. SIMULATION RESULTS

The GaAs MESFET structure used in our simulation is shown in Fig. 5. The structure consists
of a 0.1 µm-thick active layer with a doping concentration of Nd = 2 · 1017cm−3 on a 0.3 µm
buﬀer layer (Nd = 1014cm−3). The doping proﬁle is abrupt between the two layers, the lattice
temperature is TL = 300 K. For steady-state results, we used long simulation times of 30 ps
such that the steady state was de facto reached. The length of the drain and source contacts
is 0.5 µm, the gate-source separation 0.5 µm, the gate-drain separation is 1.0 µm and the gate
length is 0.8 µm. The Schottky barrier height is assumed to be 0.8 V.

In order to obtain stable and physically meaningful results, values like ∆x = ∆y = 6.1
nm for a grid size of 537 × 65 were typical values used in the simulations. The rather large
mesh was manageable due to the eﬀective multigrid algorithm used for the solution of the
Poisson equation. We found that the mesh size used in [5] was too coarse for accurate results,
although the authors improve accuracy and convergence speed of their calculations by using a
non-homogeneous grid. In fact, a non-homogeneous grid necessitates additional calculational
costs which reduce the speed of the simulation, and the timesteps also depend on the size of
the smallest cells. Furthermore, the Poisson equation was solved by a conventional successive
overrelaxation method.

the MESFET (0.077 µm below the contacts). Due to the high temperature which is reached
under the gate, the electron mobility is strongly lowered in this region. The electrons, which
overshoot under the gate, are therefore deaccelerated abruptly to a lower velocity in the high-
temperature region. The results obtained from an energy balance calculation are in good
quantitative agreement, the diﬀerences are mostly pronounced in the region where the electron
velocity is high, as it is expected from the diﬀerent treatment of the energy density in the HDM
and EBM.

In the very close vicinity of the gate, it was necessary to reduce artiﬁcially the electric ﬁeld
or the velocity of the electrons in order to stabilize our code. We checked that this does not
strongly aﬀect the simulations results outside this region due to the very low density of the
electron gas near the contact; a similar procedure was also necessary in [5, 6].

The velocity and temperature curves are in fact very similar to those of one-dimensional
simulations of ballistic diodes (n+ − n − n+-structures), which were used as simpliﬁed models
for FET channels.

It is interesting to observe in Fig. 7 that our simulation results for a coarse grid (grid size
217 × 33) are very close to those presented in Fig. 5 in [5], where a non-uniform mesh of
typical size 141 × 35 was used for a similar MESFET geometry. This may be considered as a
conﬁrmation of the results given in [5] for a relatively coars grid, but demonstrates the fact that
stability of the code does not automatically imply accuracy of the results, and an investigation
of the dependence of the results on the grid resolution is indispensable. The channel below the
gate (see also Fig. 10), which is the most interesting region in the MESFET, is relatively small

and must be resolved suﬃciently.

Due to the strong heating of the electron gas in the channel region, most electrons are excited
to the L-band. This leads to a cooling eﬀect of the electron gas, since the excitation energy
is missing in the thermal energy balance. The dash-dotted curve in Fig. 9 shows the electron
temperature that would be obtained from the HDM if the energy term βL(ω)∆EΓL in eq. (8)
were neglected. The energy ∆EΓL = 0.29 eV which is necessary to excite an electron to the
upper conduction band corresponds to a temperature diﬀerence ∆T = 2∆EΓL/3k ∼ 2000K;
the observed error is of the same size.

Finally, Fig. 10 shows a surface plot of the electron density inside the device. Clearly visible

is the MESFET channel under the gate.

5. CONCLUSION

The feasibility of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations is demonstrated for the case of
a GaAs MESFET structure. Although the single-gas hydrodynamic model is superior to the
drift-diﬀusion or energy balance model, it is desirable to direct the eﬀorts of future research
in the direction of multi-valley hydrodynamic models. Models like the EBM will no longer be
adequate for the physical description of high-speed submicron devices in the near future.

It is obvious that future attempts to model submicron devices will face many more problems
which have not been touched in this paper. One diﬃculty is the fact that the components
of semiconductor devices are often of very diﬀerent size and material composition. This
necessitates the use of adaptive discretization grids or the hybridization of diﬀerent numerical

methods, but both strategies are hampered by severe problems like numerical instabilities
or huge computational eﬀorts for realistic simulations. Another class of problems is due to
the fact that the physics of semiconductor materials is very complex, and therefore hard to
implement such that the physical behavior of the device is satisfactorily described. Attempts
to describe quantum eﬀects in device modelling should be considered as tentative in the case
of heterostructure devices. There is no optimal solution for these problems, and the numerical
and physical models have to be adapted to the problem under study. We hope that our detailed
description of a hydrodynamic simulation may serve also as a help for researchers entering the
ﬁeld of hydrodynamic semiconductor device modelling.

Inspired by, and using methods of optimization derived from classical three dimensional elec-
trostatics, we note a novel beautiful symmetric four dimensional polytope we have found with 80
vertices. We also describe how the method used to ﬁnd this symmetric polytope, and related
methods can potentially be used to ﬁnd good examples for the kissing and packing problems in D
dimensions.

Using an optimization method (described below) in-
spired by ones ourselves and others have used (see
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and refs. therein) for a problem in three di-
mensional electrostatics–Thomson’s [6] problem of ﬁnd-
ing the minimum energy of N unit point charges on the
surface of a unit conducting sphere–we have found a novel
beautiful symmetric conﬁguration with 80 vertices (Fig.
1). The polytope has 64 vertices with 12 nearest neigh-
bors of 0.7624, 0.6707, 0.7654 and 0.6661 distances, 16
vertices with 10 neighbors of 0.7654 and 0.6661 distances.
We have not seen this polytope previously [7, 8]

We found the conﬁguration looking at the slightly ar-
tiﬁcial, in four dimensions, but potentially useful (see
below), problem of ﬁnding the minimum energy con-
ﬁguration of N charges (points) on the surface of the
hypersphere (S3) x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 = 1 in four di-
mensions with the energy function Pi6=j 1/rij where r
is the Euclidean distance between two points 1 and 2
p(x1 − x2)2 + (y1 − y2)2 + (z1 − z2)2 + (w1 − w2)2. As
most surely like in three dimensions [2], in four or more
dimensions the number of good local mimima for this
problem grows exponentially with N , and thus we can-
not be certain that for N = 80 or other N that we have
found the global minima. Nevertheless, even good local
minima may be interesting or important conﬁgurations.
In this initial work we have found our best local mini-
mum for a given N by starting from 100 random initial
starting conﬁgurations and then used a standard conju-
gate gradient optimization. We have looked at N = 2 to
200. The other N s for which we have thus far found nice
symmetric conﬁgurations are for N = 5, 8, 24 and 120 for
which we found as our minimum energy conﬁguration the
simplex (4D equivalent of the tetrahedron), the 16 cell
(4D equivalent of the octahedron), the 24 cell and the
600 cell (4D equivalent of the icosahedron), respectively
(Fig. 2), four of the six completely regular Platonic solids
in four dimensions. We did not ﬁnd the other two regu-
lar polytopes, i.e. N = 16 the tesseract (or hypercube,
4D equivalent of the cube) and N = 600 the 120 cell
(4D equivalent of the dodecahedron). Their geometries

are not energy minima, similar to what happens with
the cube and the dodecahedron in 3D Thomson’s prob-
lem (Ref. [3] and references therein). Using a method
related to ours other higher dimensional polytopes have
been found[9].

The D dimensional kissing problem asks the number of
non–intersecting D dimensional unit hyperspheres that
can touch a central unit hypersphere of dimension D.
The maximal number of such spheres is known as the
kissing number for that dimension, KD. The kissing

imization of electrostatic problems to study the D–
dimensional packing problem–to ﬁnd the highest density
of D–dimensional hyperspheres that can be packed into
an inﬁnite D-dimensional (ﬂat) space–an analogue of the
above procedure can be used by working on the D dimen-
sional surface of a D + 1 dimensional torus: Indeed, for
example, the smallest distance between points on the two
dimensional surface of the standard, simple three dimen-
sional torus (doughnut/bagel) determines the density to
which two dimensional spheres/balls–i.e., disks–can be
packed.

The clearest parameterization of tori we have found for
this situation is to describe the D dimensional surface of
a (D + 1 dimensional) torus by D coordinates (x1, ..., xD)
where each xi lies in [0, 1). (So each xi is an angle scaled
to lie in [0, 1).) For any of the xi coordinates deﬁne
||xi − yi|| = |xi − yi| if |xi − yi| ≤ 1/2 or 1 − |xi − yi| if
|xi − yi| > 1/2. Then the appropriate squared intrinsic
distance between two points on the surface of the torus

= Pi ||xi − yi||
is ||(x1, x2, ..., xn) − (y1, y2, ..., yn)||
One then seeks conﬁgurations of points/unit charges that
minimize the energy function E = Pi6=j 1/ ||x − y||n
where n is an integer ≥ 1. After the minimization is
complete deﬁne r = 1/2 · min ||x − y||, where the mini-
mum is taken over all pairs of points. The volume of the
torus is simply 1D = 1. The volume of the D dimen-
sional hyperspheres which can be packed on the surface
of the torus (and also the packing density/packing frac-
tion since the torus volume equals 1) is N ·ΩD ·rD, where
ΩD = πD/2 ·Γ ((D + 2)/2) and N is the number of points
on the surface of the torus. From the packing of points
on the D dimensional surface of the D + 1 dimensional
torus one then immediately gets a packing for inﬁnite D
dimensional ﬂat space by placing a hypersphere of radius
r at every point in RD which diﬀers from the coordinates
of a point on the torus by integer amounts in each coor-
dinate.

therein for the best known kissing number in other di-
mensions. The approach of minimizing Pi6=j 1/rij in
D dimensions potentially may be useful in ﬁnding new
larger kissing numbers.
Indeed, if for a given D with
largest known kissing number KD it can be found that
a minimum energy conﬁguration with KD + 1 (or more)
charges/points can be found with each pair of points at
least D–dimensional Euclidean distance one from each
other, then a new kissing number for that dimension is
found. There is freedom in choosing the energy function
to be minimized, e.g. taking E = Pi6=j 1/rn
ij where n is
an integer > 1. Also we note that for a conﬁguration of
N points found in D dimensions with greatest separation
s between pairs of points, one thus immediately has an
analogue of a kissing problem of putting hyperspheres of
radius at least s around a central unit hypersphere.

Now, a hypersphere has positive curvature and thus
is not completely the same as ﬂat space. To use min-

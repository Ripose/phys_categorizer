The interplay between magic number stabilities and superﬂuidity of small para-hydrogen clusters
with sizes N = 5 to 40 and temperatures 0.5 K ≤ T ≤ 4.5 K is explored with classical and
quantum Path Integral Monte Carlo calculations. Clusters with N < 26 and T ≤ 1.5 K have large
superﬂuid fractions even at the stable magic numbers 13, 19, and 23. In larger clusters, superﬂuidity
is quenched especially at the magic numbers 23, 26, 29, 32, and 37 while below 1 K, superﬂuidity
is recovered for the pairs (27, 28), (30, 31), and (35, 36). For all clusters superﬂuidity is localized at
the surface and correlates with long exchange cycles involving loosely bound surface molecules.

Hydrogen is the simplest and most ubiquitous of all
molecules in the universe. On earth, it plays an impor-
tant role in many chemical reactions and is presently be-
ing developed as an energy transport medium [1]. The
j = 0 rotational state of the para-H2 nuclear spin conﬁg-
uration is, like 4He, a spin-less boson and below about
6 K has been predicted to be the only naturally occurring
superﬂuid besides the helium isotopes [2]. The observa-
tion of superﬂuidity in the bulk so far has been thwarted
by its solidiﬁcation at 13.96 K. In 1991, Sindzingre et
al.
showed theoretically that small pure clusters with
13 and 18 molecules were superﬂuid below about 2 K,
while larger clusters with 33 atoms had a much smaller
superﬂuid fraction [3]. Later, Grebenev et al. observed a
superﬂuid response in small clusters consisting of 15 − 17
para H2 molecules surrounding an OCS chromophore all
within a large helium droplet [4]. More recently magic
cluster sizes of pure pH2 clusters with N = 13, 33 and 55
were observed with Raman spectroscopy in a cryogenic
free jet expansion [5]. The earlier calculation of superﬂu-
idity in pure H2 clusters, as well as the interpretation of
the OCS(pH2)n experiments have since been conﬁrmed.
Recently, several groups have reported evidence for magic
number stabilities at N = 13 [8, 9, 10] and at 13 and 26
with a reduced superﬂuidity [11].

An intriguing aspect of these studies is the appar-
ent contradiction between the large superﬂuid fractions
and the structured radial distribution functions and the
magic number stabilities, which indicate a solid-like rigid-
ity.
It is only at high temperatures, when the clusters
are molten that the radial distributions show the same
constant interior density and smooth fall-oﬀ at the sur-
face [3, 6] found for superﬂuid helium clusters which are
known to be liquid [12]. This inconsistency has lead to
the speculation that pH2 clusters may be considered as
microscopic supersolids [3]. Thus the present study was
undertaken to clarify how a cluster which appears to be
solid can also be superﬂuid.

To resolve this apparent incompatibility, both classical
and quantum Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) calcu-
lations are reported for all sizes between N = 5 and 40

for 5 temperatures 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0 K and the experi-
mental accessible 4.5 K [13]. The calculations indicate
that clusters with N = 13, 19, 23, 26, 29, 32, 34 and 37
have highly symmetric structures and show a propensity
for stability in agreement with magic number stabilities
reported earlier for solid ionized rare gas clusters [14, 15].
In the following, these special sizes will be referred to as
magic clusters. All the H2 clusters with N < 26 have
signiﬁcant superﬂuid fractions at T ≤ 1.5 K which is
only slightly suppressed in the magic clusters. At magic
N = 26, superﬂuidity is greatly quenched and for 29, 32,
34 and 37 reduced even down to T = 0.5 K . Clusters
with size pairs (24, 25), (27, 28), (30, 31), the singleton
33, as well as (35, 36) show signiﬁcantly greater super-
ﬂuid fractions than their more stable magic neighbours.
The radial distributions of the superﬂuid fraction and the
distribution of permutation cycle lengths reveal that su-
perﬂuidity in all the clusters is localized at the surface
and for the larger superﬂuid sizes, it correlates with the
presence of loosely bound surface molecules. These new
results now clarify the apparent contradiction between
the structured radial distributions and the large super-
ﬂuidity found in the previous calculations [3, 11].

The calculations were carried using the PIMC method
which is based on the quantum-classical isomorphism
where each particle is replaced by a polymer made up
of M “beads” as explained in detail in reference [16]. In
the present quantum calculations a time step of τ = 1/80
was suﬃcient to obtain converged results within the pair-
product approximation. Bose statistics is introduced by
cross linking the polymers to form chains of permut-
ing cycles (polymers). The classical calculations involve
no quantum eﬀects such as permutations and are de-
scribed in Ref.[17]. Two intermolecular potentials were
used: 1) a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential with parame-
ters σ = 2.96˚A and ǫ = 34.16 K and 2) the more ac-
curate Silvera-Goldman (SG) potential. The initial con-
ﬁgurations were chosen either from the Cambridge Clus-
ter Database [18] or by carving out a spherical region
centered around a molecule in an hcp H2 crystal. The
important eﬀects reported here were independent of the

potential and the initial conﬁguration.

Cluster size N

FIG. 1: Energy diﬀerences ∆E as a function of cluster sizes
calculated classically (a) and with a quantum mechanical
PIMC program (b). The sharp minima marked by downward
arrows are attributed to especially stable magic icosahedral-
derived structures [14, 15].

Magic classical and quantum clusters were identiﬁed by
examining the energy diﬀerences ∆E = E(N, T )−E(N −
1, T ), where E(N, T ) is the total internal energy for a
cluster of N molecules at temperature T . ∆E approaches
the chemical potential at T = 0, hence sizes with ∆E val-
ues lower than their neighbours are more localized and
more tightly bound. Both, the classical and the quantum
results show about the same enhanced relative stabilities
at the magic cluster sizes N = 13, 19, 23, 26, 29,and 32
indicating that the classical stabilities persist in the quan-
tum clusters. Although 36 and 38 appear to be “magic”
in the classical simulation, the expected magic 34 and 37,
are found only in the quantum calculations[14, 15]. All
our quantum calculated magic numbers agree with well-
known high symmetry icosahedral-derived structures [14]
and have been repeatedly observed in ionized rare gas
clusters [14, 15]. So far, however, only magic N = 13, 33
and 55, have been observed experimentally [5]. Whereas
N = 13 and 55 correspond to the closing of the ﬁrst and
second icosahedral shells, N = 33 is not a magic number
among the possible modiﬁed icosahedral structures but
has a dodecahedral form. Since the experimental resolu-
tion [5] was not suﬃcient to distinguish from the nearby
magic 32 and 34, it is possible that the earlier assignment
may be incorrect. Especially if one considers that dur-
ing cluster growth icosahedral modiﬁed structures will
be preferred as a result of build-up around the smallest
magic N = 13 which will be a nucleus for further growth.
The superﬂuid fraction ρs/ρtotal [16] is shown in Fig.2
as a function of cluster size and temperature. The nearly
100% fraction in the small clusters decreases sharply
above 1.5 K [19]. At each of the magic sizes ρs/ρtot al-
most always shows a downward dip reminiscent of those

Cluster Size N

FIG. 2: The total superﬂuid density fraction is plotted as
a function of cluster size for ﬁve diﬀerent temperatures.
The downward arrows indicate the magic clusters with high
symmetry. The upward pointing arrows indicate islands of
sizes exhibiting enhanced superﬂuidity. Superﬂuidity beyond
N = 26 above 3 K is below 3%.

in Fig. 1. These dips are smallest in the small clusters
but are more pronounced for N ≥ 26. Thus, the classical
rigidity at the magic sizes suppresses the quantum de-
localization needed for superﬂuidity, an eﬀect which be-
comes stronger with increasing size. Surprisingly, beyond
magic N = 23, the superﬂuid fraction at 1 K jumps back
to about unity for the next larger sizes (24, 25). Then
beyond magic N = 26 a similar rebound occurs for the
two lowest temperatures at (27, 28). The minimum at
N = 23 and two maxima at N = 25, 27 were also found
in recent calculations by Mezzacapo and Bonisegni [11].
In the present calculations similar maxima are found at
(30, 31),and (35, 36). The singleton N = 33 has a very
weak rebound and seems to follow the behaviour of the
neighbouring magic sizes as its relatively low binding en-
ergy in Fig.1(b) also suggests. Thus in clusters with solid-
like stable structures superﬂuidity is suppressed, with the
largest suppressions found for N ≥ 26, while at sizes not
corresponding to known magic sizes, it is restored. It is
interesting to note that at 1.5 K the interactions are so
strong that superﬂuidity is almost suppressed for clus-
ters N ≥ 26, yet quantum delocalization in the smaller
clusters is still suﬃcient for their superﬂuidity.

To understand these unexpected out-of-phase oscillla-
tions between magic sizes and superﬂuid sizes the three
types of radial distributions shown in Fig.3 were calcu-
lated for the magic N = 26 cluster and the two adja-
cent less stable but more superﬂuid clusters. Fig.3 (a)
shows the classical distributions at 1.5 K. As expected
classicaly(Fig.3(a)),the molecules in N = 26 follow an or-
derly partitioning into four localised and distinct groups,
whereas for N = 25, 27 they are randomly distributed.
The quantum distributions (Fig. 3b) with only two broad
peaks show evidence of quantum exchanges between the
shells. The magic N = 26 cluster has a noticeably larger
inner peak compared to its neighbors and also shows a

FIG. 3: Comparison of radial density distributions for the
magic cluster N = 26 and the neighbours (25, 27) for three
characteristic temperatures. The distributions in (a) are clas-
sical and those in (b) are from quantum calculations. The
radial distribution of the superﬂuid fraction is plotted in (c).
We show one temperature in (a) since the classical distribu-
tions are less sensitive to temperature.

slight dimple in the second outermost peak reminiscent
of the classical distribution. The radial dependence of
the superﬂuid fraction ρs(r)/ρ [20] in Fig.3(c) is com-
puted by binning the radial location of the beads that
are involved in permutation cycles [20]. These distribu-
tions exhibit large diﬀerences with temperature and with
sizes as expected from Fig. 2. Surprisingly, however, su-
perﬂuidity is not greatest near the center as found for
4He clusters [12], but is localized at the surface beyond
the outer maximum in the radial density distribution.
The superﬂuidity is small in the inner shell specially for
magic N = 26. We note that the apparent randomness in
the classical radial curves (Fig.3(a)), which is suggestive
of less rigid and symmetric structures for the non-magic
N = 25 and 27, correlates with the increased superﬂuid
fractions (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 2).

Additional insight comes from Fig.4 which provides a
cross section view of N = 13, 26 and 27 and the probabil-
ity distributions of the permutation cycles as a function
of the permutation lengths. The contours for N = 13
show a considerable delocalization of the outer layer. The
N = 13 permutation probabilities are dominated by cy-
cles with lengths of 5 and 6 molecules, corresponding to
rings around the center, with a relatively high probability
of 10% in accordance with the large superﬂuid fraction
(Fig. 2). Even though the central molecule appears to be
localized in the contour plot at 0.5 K, it also participates
in ring exchanges as indicated by the small ≈ 0.1% prob-
ability for cycle exchange lengths of 13. The contour
plot for magic N = 26 indicates that all its molecules
are highly localized and that it is solid-like justifying the
greatly suppressed superﬂuidity (Fig. 2). Contours at

FIG. 4: Top panels: Density contour plots at z ≈ 0 plane for
magic N = 13, 26 and non-magic N = 27. Bottom panels:The
probability distributions for permutations of a given length.
The contours for magic N = 13, show delocalized molecules
at the outer layer that take part in cycles with lengths 5 and
6 which correspond to rings around the central molecule. In
magic N = 26 at 1.0 K, all the molecules are highly localized.
The surface molecules in N = 27 cluster at 1 K are highly
delocalized, whereas the core molecules are nearly rigid. This
correlates with the long exchange paths around the localized
core shown below the contour plot.

diﬀerent values of z for larger clusters at T ≥ 1.5 K (not
shown) show similar localization. The corresponding per-
mutation probabilities are peaked at very low cycle num-
bers and are mostly less than 0.05%, which explains their
small residual superﬂuidity in Fig. 2. But as shown by
the permutation probabilities even the magic N = 26
melts and become superﬂuid at 0.5 K with a predomi-
nance of cycles from 7 to 15. The top panel in Fig. 4
for non-magic N = 27 has a liquid outer layer similar to
magic 13 in agreement with Fig. 3(c) but with a smaller
peak permutation probability of about 3.5% as expected
from its small overall superﬂuid fraction (Fig. 2). At
0.5 K the permutation probability curve smoothens and
extends out to include cycles equal to 27 suggesting that
also the core molecules are participating in the permu-
tations. Thus both the contour plots and probability
distributions of the N = 27 cluster are consistent with
the onset of superﬂuidity in the surface region.

Recently, Mezzacapo and Boninsegni also observed an
enhanced superﬂuidity for N = 25, but their conclusion
that “the addition of a molecule to the N + 1 = 26 has
the eﬀect of frustrating the solid order of the inner shell,
increasing molecule delocalization and leading to quan-
tum exchanges” [11] is at variance with these new results,
which clearly show that superﬂuidity is at the surface.

The nature of the disorder favouring a large superﬂuid
fraction at the surface emerges from the “inherent struc-
ture” (IS) analysis of Stillinger and Weber [21]: “inherent
structures which underlie the liquid state are those sta-
ble particle packings (potential minima) which can be
reached by a steepest descent quench on the potential

energy hypersurface”. This quenching procedure elimi-
nates all kinetic eﬀects due to thermal excitations or zero-
point motion. To generalize this concept to quantum me-
chanical systems, in the steepest descent minimization,
the gradient was calculated from the path integral action
rather than from the potential. The permutations were
turned oﬀ and the IS analysis was applied to “Boltzman-
nons”. The quenched structures are, in general, indepen-
dent of the temperature [21] and are identical to Wales
classical minimum potential energy conﬁgurations [18].
This geometric spatial correspondence explains the ori-
gin of the persistence of the classical structures in the
energy and superﬂuid densities discussed above.

Among the small cluster sizes, a quenched conﬁgura-
tion similar to the Wales body centered icosahedron was
quite often found for N = 13 indicating that it is par-
ticularly stable. Occasionally, quenching would generate
variant structures close to the classical ones with some
delocalized molecules on the surface suggestive of melt-
ing. Clusters diﬀering by one or two molecules from the
magic sizes are more often seen to have defective sur-
faces. Since these clusters diﬀer essentially only in the
bonding of the outer molecules, their smaller binding en-
ergies (Fig.2) indicate that these outer molecules are less
tightly bound than in the case of the magic clusters. For
example, N = 18 would statistically appear more often
with structures that deviate slightly from the classical
clusters, while for magic N = 19, almost every IS cluster
is the same as the classical cluster. The IS analysis for the
other larger superﬂuid sizes indicates that their surface
molecules are also less tightly bound and less ordered.

In summary, our analysis reveals that pure pH2 clus-
ters with N < 26 at temperatures T ≤ 1.5 K are liquid-
like and have a large superﬂuid response. It is only some-
what reduced in magic clusters N = 13, 19 and 23, which
are classical magic sizes with highly symmetric icosahe-
dral structures. According to Fig 1 (b), the diﬀerence in
internal energies, which is the energy needed to add one
molecule, is less than 38 K for these highly superﬂuid
clusters. The larger magic clusters N = 26, 29, 32, 34,
and 37, in which superﬂuidity is strongly quenched at
temperatures T > 0.5 K, all have considerably larger
internal energy diﬀerences of more than about 40 K.
Superﬂuidity is restored in the cluster size pairs N =
(24, 25), (27, 28), (30, 31), the singleton 33, and (35, 36),
with smaller internal energy diﬀerences compared to the
magic clusters which lie in between. In these superﬂuid
sizes, quantum delocalization of the loosely bound ad-
molecules enables them to explore many diﬀerent surface
structures, thereby favouring large permutation cycles
and an increased superﬂuidity. Our calculations reveal
that with increasing cluster size the strong many-body
intermolecular interactions lead to a rigid solid-like inner
core thereby pushing the delocalization induced super-
ﬂuidity towards the surface, where it is favored by the

4

reduced coordination and weak inward interaction with
the small central core. The overall decay of superﬂuid-
ity with cluster size and its increased localization on the
surface agrees with the macroscopic limit of 2D surface
superﬂuidity and zero response in the bulk [22].

(Published from Physical Review E. 62, 2914, (2000).)

A fast and stable method is formulated to compute the time evolution of a wavefunction by
numerically solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. This method is a real space/real time
evolution method implemented by several computational techniques such as Suzuki’s exponential
product, Cayley’s form, the ﬁnite diﬀerential method and an operator named adhesive operator.
This method conserves the norm of the wavefunction, manages periodic conditions and adaptive
mesh reﬁnement technique, and is suitable for vector- and parallel-type supercomputers. Applying
this method to some simple electron dynamics, we conﬁrmed the eﬃciency and accuracy of the
method for simulating fast time-dependent quantum phenomena.

I. INTRODUCTION

There are many computational method of solving the
TD-Schr¨odinger equation numerically. Conventionally,
a wavefunction has been represented as a linear com-
bination of plane waves or atomic orbitals. However,
these representations entail high computational cost to
calculate the matrix elements for these bases. The plane
wave bases set is not suitable for localized orbitals, and
the atomic orbital bases set is not suitable for spreading
waves. Moreover, they are not suitable for paralleliza-
tion, since the calculation of matrix elements requires
massive data transmission among processors.

To overcome those problems, some numerical methods
adopted real space representation [1–4]. In those meth-
ods, a wavefunction is descritized by grid points in real
space, and with them some dynamic electron phenomena
were simulated successfully [6–8].

Among these real space methods, a method called
Cayley’s form or Crank-Nicholson scheme is known to
be especially useful for one-dimensional closed systems
because this method conserves the norm of the wave-
function exactly and the simulation is rather stable and
accurate even in a long time slice. These characteris-
tics are very attractive for simulations over a long time
span. Unfortunately, this method is not suitable for two-
or three-dimensional systems. This problem is fatal for
physically meaningful systems. Though there are many
other computational methods that can manage two- or
three-dimensional systems, these methods also have dis-
advantages.

In the present work, we have overcome the problems
associated with Cayley’s form and have formulated a
new computational method which is more eﬃcient, more
adaptable and more attractive than any other ordinary
methods.

In our method, all computations are performed in real
space so there is no need of using Fourier transform. The
time evolution operator in our method is exactly unitary
by using Cayley’s form and Suzuki’s exponential product

so that the norm of the wavefunction is conserved during
the time evolution. Stability and accuracy are improved
by Cayley’s form so we can use a longer time slice than
those of the other methods. Cayley’s form is a kind of
implicit methods, this is the key to the stability, but im-
plicit methods are not suitable for periodic conditions
and parallelization. We have avoided these problems by
introducing an operator named adhesive operator. This
adhesive operator is also useful for adaptive mesh reﬁne-
ment technique.

Our method inherits many advantages from many ordi-
nary methods, and yet more improved in many aspects.
With these advantages, this method will be useful for
simulating large-scale and long-term quantum electron
dynamics from ﬁrst principles.

In section II, we formulate the new method step by
step. In section III, we apply it to some simulations of
electron dynamics and demonstrate its eﬃciency. In sec-
tion IV, we draw some conclusions.

II. FORMULATION

In this section, we formulate the new method step
by step from the simplest case to complicated cases.
Throughout this paper, we use the atomic units ¯h =
1, m = 1, e = 1.

A. One-dimensional closed free system

For the ﬁrst step, we consider a one-dimensional closed
system where an electron moves freely but never leaks
out of the system. The TD-Schr¨odinger equation of this
system is simply given as

i

∂ψ(x, t)
∂t

∂2
x
2

=

−

ψ(x, t) .

(1)

The solution of Eq. (1) is analytically given by an ex-

decomposed into the LU form as

ponential operator as

ψ(x, t + ∆t) = exp

i∆t

ψ(x, t) ,

(2)

∂2
x
2

i

h

where ∆t is a small time slice. By using Eq. (2) repeat-
edly, the time evolution of the wavefunction is obtained.
An approximation is utilized to make a concrete form
of the exponential operator. We have to be careful not to
destroy the unitarity of the time evolution operator, oth-
erwise the wavefunction rapidly diverges. We adopted
Cayley’s form because it is unconditionally stable and
accurate enough. Cayley’s form is a fractional approxi-
mation of the exponential operator given by

exp

i∆t

h

∂2
x
2

≃

i

1 + i∆t∂2
i∆t∂2

x/4
x/4

.

(3)

It is second-order accurate in time. By substituting
Eq. (3) for Eq. (2) and moving the denominator onto the
left-hand side, the following basic equation is obtained:

i

ψ(x, t + ∆t) =

1 + i

ψ(x, t) . (4)

This is identical with the well-known Crank-Nicholson
scheme. The wavefunction is descritized by grid points
in real space as

ψi(t) = ψ(xi, t) ;

xi = i∆x,

i = 0,

, N

where ∆x is the span of the grid points. We approximate
the spatial diﬀerential operator by the ﬁnite diﬀerence
method (FDM). Then Eq. (4) becomes a simultaneous
linear equation for the vector quantity ψi(t + ∆t). For
example, in a system with six grid points, Eq. (4) is ap-
proximated in the following way:

The auxiliary vector ui is determined in advance, and it
is treated as a constant vector in Eq. (10). 26N ﬂoat-
ing operations are heeded to solve Eq. (10); here N is
the number of the grid points in the system, about twice
that of the Euler method. Unlike the Euler method, it ex-
actly conserves the norm because the matrices in Eq. (6)
are unitary. Moreover, the expected energy is conserved
because the time evolution operator commutes with the
Hamiltonian in this case.

B. Three-dimensional closed free system

It is easy to extend this technique to a three-
dimensional system. The formal solution of the TD-
Schr¨odinger equation in a three-dimensional system is
given by an exponential of the sum of three second dif-
ferential operators as

∂2

(cid:16)

(cid:17)i

These diﬀerential operators in Eq. (11) are commutable
among each other, so the exponential operator is exactly
decomposed into a product of three exponential opera-
tors:

ψ(r, t + ∆t) = exp

(13)

and ψ0 and ψ5 are ﬁxed at zero due to the boundary
condition.

It is easy to solve this simultaneous linear equation be-
cause the matrix appearing on the left-hand side is easily

78N ﬂoating operations are required to compute
Eq. (13); where N is the total number of grid points in
the system. The norm and energy are conserved exactly.

By the way, a conventional method, Peaceman-
Rachfold method [1,8], utilizes similar approximation ap-
pearing on Eq. (13), which is a kind of the alternating
direction implicit method (ADI method). However, by
using exponential product, we have found that there is
no need of ADI. This fact makes the programming code
simpler and it runs faster.

The decomposition (16) is a second-order one. Higher-
order decompositions are derived using Suzuki’s fractal
decomposition [9–11,13]. For instance, a fourth-order
fractal decomposition S4(∆t) is given by

S4(∆t) = S2(s∆t) S2(s∆t) S2((1

4s)∆t)
S2(s∆t) S2(s∆t)

C. Static potential

Next we consider a system subjected to a static exter-
nal scalar ﬁeld V (r). The TD-Schr¨odinger equation and
its formal solution in this system are as follows:

i

∂ψ(r, t)
∂t

=

ψ(r, t + ∆t) = exp

To cooperate with the potential in the framework of the
formula described in the previous subsections, we have to
separate the potential operator from the kinetic operator
using Suzuki’s exponential product theory [9,10] as

ψ(r, t + ∆t) = exp

This decomposition is correct up to the second-order
of ∆t. The exponential of the potential is computed by
just changing the phase of the wavefunction at each grid
point. The exponential of the Laplacian is computed in
the way described in the previous subsections. Each op-
erator is exactly unitary, so the norm is conserved exactly.
But due to the separation of the incommutable operators,
the energy is not conserved exactly. Yet it oscillates near
around its initial values and it never drifts monotonously.
This algorithm is quite suitable for vector-type super-
computers because all operations are independent by grid
points, by rows, or by columns. The outline of this pro-
cedure for a two-dimensional system is schematically de-
scribed by Fig. 1.

D. Dynamic potential

To discuss high-speed electron dynamics caused by a
time-dependent external ﬁeld V (r, t), we should take ac-
count of the evolution of the potential itself in the TD-
Schr¨odinger equation given as

The analytic solution of Eq. (19) is given by a Dyson’s
time ordering operator P as

The theory of the decomposition of an exponential with
time ordering was derived by Suzuki [12]. The result is
rather simple. For instance, the second-order decompo-
sition is simply given by

E. Periodic system

In a crystal or periodic system, the wavefunctions must

obey a periodic condition:

ψ(r + R, t) = ψ(r, t) exp [iφ] ,

(24)

where k is the Bloch wave number and R is the unit
vector of the lattice. The matrix form equation corre-
sponding to Eq. (6) in this system takes the following
form:

These matrices have extra elements, so the equation can
no longer be solve eﬃciently.

We propose a trick to avoid this problem. We repre-
x as a sum

sent the second spatial diﬀerential operator ∂2
of two operators:

The exponential of ∂2

This operation is exactly unitary and easy to compute.
xtd is computed in the ordinary
way. Thus the norm is conserved. We named ∂2
ad an
“adhesive operator” because this operator plays the role
of an adhesion to connect both edges of the system. The
outline of the procedure for a two-dimensional periodic
system is schematically described by Fig. 2.

The ﬁrst matrix on the right-hand side, which corre-
sponds to ∂2

corresponds to ∂2

The interior of the ﬁrst matrix on the right-hand side
is separated into two blocks, which means this system
is separated into two physically independent areas. The
second matrix, which is the adhesive operator, connects
the two areas. A large system is separated into many
small areas, and each area is managed by a single pro-
cessor. Since the exponential of a block diagonal ma-
trix is also a block diagonal matrix, each block is com-
puted by a single processor independently. Data trans-
mission is needed only to compute the adhesive oper-
ator. The amount of data transmission is quite small,
nearly negligible. The outline of the procedure for a two-
dimensional closed system on two processors is schemat-
ically described by Fig. 3.

In this way, it is found that the adhesive operator is

system by the present method.

III. APPLICATION

In this section, we show some applications of our nu-
merical method. Though these applications treat simple
physical systems, they are suﬃcient for verifying the re-
liability and eﬃciency of the method. Throughout this
section, we use the atomic units (a.u.).

A. Comparison with conventional methods

As far as we know, the conventional methods of solv-
ing the TD-Schr¨odinger equation are classiﬁed into three
categories: 1) the multistep method [3], 2) the method
developed by De Raedt [2] and 3) the method equipped
with Cayley’s form [5].

In this section, we make brief comparisons between
Cayley’s form and other conventional methods by sim-
ply simulating a Gaussian wave packet moving in a one-
dimensional free system as illustrated in Fig. 5.

exponential of the adhesive operator for parallel computing.
The operation of the adhesive operator needs only the values
at the edges of the areas, so the data transmission between
the processors is quite small.

G. Adaptive mesh reﬁnement

It is necessary for real space computation to be
equipped with an adaptive mesh reﬁnement to reduce the
computational cost or to improve the accuracy in some
important regions. We improved the adhesive operator
to manage a connection of between two regions whose
mesh sizes are diﬀerent, as illustrated in Fig. 4.

The model system for comparison with con-

We use the second-order version of the multistep

with Cayley’s form since Cayley’s form is second-order
accurate in space and time.

The time evolution of this method is exactly unitary, and
the norm is exactly conserved unconditionally. However,
it seems that the accuracy tends to break down on the
condition that ∆t/∆x2 > 1.0. This method needs 18N
ﬂoating operations per time step, which is the fastest
method in unconditionally norm-conserving methods.

The time evolution of this method is exactly unitary,
and the norm is exactly conserved unconditionally. More-
over, this method maintains good accuracy even under
the condition that ∆t/∆x2 > 1.0. This method needs
26N ﬂoating operations per time step, which is the fastest
method in unconditionally stable methods.

We have simulated the motion of the Gaussian by those
methods. First we show a comparison of Cayley’s form
with the conventional methods in the framework of the
FDM. Figure 6 shows the time evolution of the error in
the energy, which is evaluated by the ﬁnite diﬀerence
method as described below

The initial energy is evaluated as 73.03a.u., though it is
theoretically expected to be 74a.u. The ratio ∆t/∆x2 is
set at 0.5 to meet the stable condition required for the
multistep method.

The energies violently oscillate in the results of the
multistep method and De Raedt’s method, as a result
of the fact that these time evolution operators do not
commute with the Hamiltonian. These energies seem to
converge after the wave packet is delocalized in a uniform
way over the system. Meanwhile, the energy is conserved
exactly in the result of Cayley’s form because Cayley’s
form commutes with the spatial second diﬀerential oper-
ator which is the Hamiltonian itself in this system.

Figure 7 shows the relation of the time slice ∆t to the
error in the average momentum of the Gaussian, which

error of Cayley’s form is rather small. The spatial slice is set

In the multistep method, the computation cannot
be performed due to a ﬂoating exception, if the ratio
∆t/∆x2 exceeds 0.5. In De Raedt’s method, the error be-
comes too large to plot in this graph if the ratio ∆t/∆x2
exceeds 1.0. Meanwhile, in Cayley’s form, the error is
not so large even if the ratio ∆t/∆x2 exceeds 1.0.

In this way, Cayley’s form is found rather stable.
Therefore, we can use a longer time slice than those of the
other methods. And this Cayley’s form becomes suitable
for three-dimensional systems, potentials, periodic condi-
tions, adaptive mesh reﬁnement, and parallelizations by
our improvements in this paper.

B. Test of the adhesive operator

To verify the reliability and eﬃciency of the adhesive
operator for periodic condition and parallelization, we
have simulated the motion of a Gaussian wave packet in
a two-dimensional free system. As illustrated in Fig. 8,
this system has periodic conditions along both the x-axis
and the y-axis, and it is divided into nine areas, each of
them is managed by a single processing element; the ad-
hesive operator connects them. The initial wavefunction
is set as a Gaussian given as

theoretically derived as 1.0625a.u.

Second, we allocate 64

64 grid points only in the cen-
tral area as illustrated in Fig. 11. We utilize the adhesive
operator for the adaptive mesh reﬁnement. Figure 12
shows the snapshots, with the Gaussian going through
these areas smoothly. Figure 13 shows the evolution of
the energy, which is observed to oscillate near its initial
value. In this way, the reliability of the adhesive operator
is proved.

physical size is set at 8.0a.u. × 8.0a.u. The time slice is set at
∆t = 1/16a.u.

C. Excitation of a hydrogen

As the last application of the present method, we
demonstrate its validity and eﬃciency in describing the
process of photon-induced electron excitation in a hy-
drogen atom in a strong laser ﬁeld. The laser is treated
as a classically oscillating electric force polarized in the
z-direction:

Ez = Eo sin ωt .

(55)

The spatial variation of the electric ﬁeld of the light is
neglected, because the electron system is much smaller
than the order of the wave length. Then the interaction
term of the Hamiltonian is approximated as

int =

eEzz .

(56)

H

−
In other words, we only take into account the electro-
dipole interaction of the electron with the light, and ne-
glect the electro-quadrapole, the magnetic-dipole, and
other higher interactions.

The amplitude Eo is set at 1/64a.u. = 0.80V/˚A, which
is as strong as a usual pulse laser. The angular frequency
ω is set at 0.3125a.u. = 8.5eV, less than the transition en-
ergy between 1S and 2P. Ordinarily, such low energetic
electric force has no eﬀect on the electronic excitation.
But with such a strong amplitude, various nonlinear op-
tical eﬀects are caused by the electron dynamics.

We allocate 1283 grid points in a 323a.u.3 cubic closed
system. The hydrogen nucleus is located at the center of
the system, and the nucleus potential is constructed by
solving the Poisson equation in the discretized space to
avoid the singularity of the nucleus potential. The 1S-
orbital is assumed as the initial state of the wavefunction.
Then we turn on the electric ﬁeld and start the simula-
10−3fs
tion. The time slice is set at 0.0785a.u. = 2.0
so as to follow the rapid variation of the wavefunction

×

and the electric force. We follow the evolution for 32k
iteration.

Figure 14 shows the time variance in the polarization of
the electron. The oscillation of the polarization generates
another electric ﬁeld, which corresponds to a non-linearly
scattered light from the atom. By Fourier-transforming
the polarization along the time axis, we obtained the
spectrum of the scattered light shown in Fig. 15.

Photon energy [eV]

FIG. 15. Spectrum of the scattered light generated by the

oscillation of the electron.

Several sharp peaks are found, which are interpreted as
follows: The peak at 8.5eV comes from Rayleigh scatter-
ing, whose frequency is identical with the injected light:
ω. The peak at 10.2eV comes from Lyman α emission,
which is generated by the electron transition from the 2P-
orbital to the 1S-orbital: ωLα. On the other hand, the
peak at 12.1eV comes from Lyman β emission, which is
generated by the electron transition from the 3P-orbital
to the 1S-orbital: ωLβ . The peak at 6.8eV comes from hy-
per Raman scattering, whose frequency is identical with
ωLα. Moreover the peak at 25.5eV comes from the
2ω
third harmonic generation, whose frequency is identical
with 3ω.

−

9

The simulation is also performed for a diﬀerent laser
frequency; the injecting photon energy ω is set at 10.2eV,
which is the same as the transition energy between 1S and
2P. In this case the electron starting from a 1S orbital is
expected to excite to a 2Pz orbital. Figure 16 shows the
snapshots of the density during the simulation time span.

One could obtain such behavior analytically by using
perturbation theory; however, with the present method,
we could directly calculate them without perturbation
theory and without information on the excited states of
the system.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have formulated a new method for solving the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation numerically in real
space. We have found that by using Cayley’s form and
Suzuki’s fractal decomposition, the simulation can be
fast, stable, accurate, and suitable for vector-type su-
percomputers. We have proposed the adhesive operator
to make Cayley’s form suitable for periodic systems and
parallelization and adaptive mesh reﬁnement.

These techniques will also be useful for the time-
dependent Kohn Sham equation, which is our future
work.

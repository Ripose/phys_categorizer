Abstract. The ubiquity of modular structure in real-world complex networks is being
the focus of attention in many trials to understand the interplay between network
topology and functionality. The best approaches to the identiﬁcation of modular
structure are based on the optimization of a quality function known as modularity.
However this optimization is a hard task provided that the computational complexity
of the problem is in the NP-hard class. Here we propose an exact method for reducing
the size of weighted (directed and undirected) complex networks while maintaining
invariant its modularity. This size reduction allows the heuristic algorithms that
optimize modularity for a better exploration of the modularity landscape. We compare
the modularity obtained in several real complex-networks by using the Extremal
Optimization algorithm, before and after the size reduction, showing the improvement
obtained. We speculate that the proposed analytical size reduction could be extended
to an exact coarse graining of the network in the scope of real-space renormalization.

1. Introduction

The study of the community structure in complex networks is becoming a classical
subject in the area because several aspects of the problem are both challenging and
interesting. The challenge comes from the diﬃculty for unveiling the best partition of
the network in terms of communities, in the sense of groups of nodes that are more
intraconnected rather than interconnected between them [1]. The interest comes from
the fact that this level of description could help to elucidate an organization of the
network prescribed by functionalities [2, 3], and also because it resembles the coarse
graining process in statistical physics to describe systems at the mesoscale.

The most successful solutions to the community detection problem, in terms of
accuracy and computational cost required, are those based in the optimization of a
quality function called modularity proposed by Newman [4] that allows the comparison
of diﬀerent partitioning of the network. Given a network partitioned into communities,
being Ci the community to which node i is assigned, the mathematical deﬁnition of
modularity is expressed in terms of the weighted adjacency matrix wij, that represents
the value of the weight in the link between i and j (0 if no link exists), and the strengths
wi =

wij as [5]

where the Kronecker delta function δ(Ci, Cj) takes the values, 1 if nodes i and j are into
the same community, 0 otherwise, and the total strength 2w =

wij.

The modularity of a given partition is then the probability of having edges falling
within groups in the network minus the expected probability in an equivalent (null case)
network with the same number of nodes, and edges placed at random preserving the
nodes’ strength. The larger the value of modularity the best the partitioning is, because
more deviates from the null case. Several authors have attacked the problem proposing
diﬀerent optimization heuristics [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] since the number of diﬀerent partitions
are equal to the Bell [12] or exponential numbers, which grow at least exponentially in the
number of nodes N. Indeed, optimization of modularity is a NP-hard (Non-deterministic
Polynomial-time hard) problem [13].

The deﬁnition of modularity can be also extended, preserving its semantics in terms

of probability, to the scenario of weighted directed networks as follows:

The input and output strengths are equal (wi = wi
undirected, thus recovering the standard deﬁnition of strength. Furthermore, if the
network is unweighted and undirected, wi represents the degree of the i-th node, i.e. the
number of edges attached to it, and w is the total number of links of the network.

out = wi

The challenge of optimizing the modularity has deserved many eﬀorts from
the scientiﬁc community in the recent years. Provided the problem is NP-hard,
only optimization heuristics have been shown to be competent in ﬁnding sub-
optimal solutions of Q in feasible computational time. Nevertheless, when facing the
decomposition in communities of very large networks, optimality is usually sacriﬁced in
favor of computational time.

Our goal here is to demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the size of complex
networks while preserving the value of modularity, independently on the partition under
consideration. The systematic use of this reduction allows for a more exhaustive search
of the partitions’ space that usually ends in improved values of modularity compared
to those obtained without using this size reduction. The paper is organized as follows:
In the next section we present the basics for the size reduction process. After that,
we provide analytic proofs for speciﬁc reductions. Finally we exploit the reduction
process based on the mentioned properties, and compare the modularity results with
those obtained without size reduction in several real networks, using the Extremal
Optimization heuristics [8].

2. Size reduction preserving modularity

2.1. Reduced graph

Let G be a weighted complex network of size N, with weights wij ≥ 0, i, j ∈ {1, . . . , N}.
If the network is unweighted, the weights matrix becomes the usual connectivity matrix,
with values 1 for connected pairs of nodes, zero otherwise. We will assume that the
network may be directed, i.e. represented by a non symmetric weights’ matrix.

Any grouping of the N nodes of the complex network G in N ′ parts may be
represented by a surjective function R : {1, . . . , N} −→ {1, . . . , N ′} which assigns a
group index Ri ≡ R(i) to every i-th node in G. The reduced network G′ in which each
of these groups is replaced by a single node may be easily deﬁned in the following way:
the weight w′
rs between the nodes which represent groups r and s is the sum of all the
weights connecting vertices in these groups,

w′

rs =

wijδ(Ri, r)δ(Rj, s) , r, s ∈ {1, . . . , N ′}

(2.1)

where the sums run over all the N nodes of G. For unweighted networks the value of
w′
rs is just the number of arcs from the ﬁrst to the second group of nodes. It must be

2.2. Modularity preservation

The main property of the reduced network is the preservation of modularity (1.1) or
(1.2), i.e. the modularity of any partition of the reduced graph is equal to the modularity
of its corresponding partition of the original network.

More precisely, let C ′ : {1, . . . , N ′} −→ {1, . . . , M} be a partition in M clusters
of the reduced network G′. Its corresponding partition C : {1, . . . , N} −→ {1, . . . , M}
of the original graph is given by the composition of the reducing function R with the
partition C ′, i.e. C = C ′ ◦ R. Therefore, the statement of the previous paragraph
becomes

Q′(C ′) = Q(C) .

The proof is straightforward:

We have found a relevant property of modularity namely that those nodes forming a
community in the optimal partition can be represented by a unique node in the reduced
network. Each node in the reduced network summarizes the information necessary for

Size reduction of complex networks preserving modularity

the calculation of modularity in its self-loop (that accounts for the intraconnectivity of
the community) and its arcs (that account for the total strengths with the rest of the
network). The question now is: how to determine which nodes will belong to the same
community in the optimal partition, before this partition is obtained? The answer will
provide with a size reduction method in complex networks preserving modularity.

3. Analytic reductions

Here we give the proof for certain possible analytic size reductions of weighted networks,
undirected and directed.

3.1. Reductions for undirected networks

The modularity of an undirected network may be written as

where

Q =

qi =

δ(Ci, Cj)

is the contribution to modularity of the i-th node. If we allow this node to change of
community, the value of Ci becomes a parameter, and therefore it is useful to deﬁne

qi,r =

1
2w

Xj (cid:18)

wiwj
2w (cid:19)

wij −

δ(Cj, r) ,

qi = qi,Ci ,

which accounts for the contribution of the i-th node to modularity if it were in
community r. The separation of the self-loop term, which does not depend on which
community node i belongs to, yields to the deﬁnition of

satisfying

and

and

˜qi,r =

.

The role of these individual node contributions to modularity becomes evident in
the expression of the change of modularity when node i goes from community r to
community s:

∆Q = 2(˜qi,s − ˜qi,r) .

(3.8)

Size reduction of complex networks preserving modularity

As a particular case, a node that forms its own community, i.e. an isolated node i, which
moves to any community s produces a change in modularity

∆Q = 2˜qi,s .

Therefore, if there exists a community s for which ˜qi,s > 0, node i cannot be isolated in
the partition of optimal modularity. This existence is easily proved by considering the
sum of ˜qi,r for all communities:

˜qi,r =

where we have made use of the deﬁnitions of strength wi and total strength 2w for the
simpliﬁcation of the expression. Thus,

if wii ≤

⇒

˜qi,r ≥ 0 ⇒ ∃s : ˜qi,s ≥ 0 ,

(3.11)

w2
i

completing the proof that there are no isolated nodes in the conﬁguration which
maximizes modularity, unless they have a big enough self-loop §.

Now, it remains the problem of the determination of an acquaintance (node j) of
node i in its optimal community, in order to group them (Ri = Rj) in a single equivalent
node with a self-loop, as explained above. If we know that nodes i and j share the same
community at maximum modularity, the reduced network will be equivalent to the
original one as regards modularity: no information lost, and a smaller size. Taking into
account that the sign of the ˜qi,r can only be positive if there is a link between node i
and another node in community r, the only candidates to be the right acquaintance of
any node are its neighbors in the network.

The simplest particular cases are hairs, i.e. nodes connected to the network with

only one link. Hence, a hair can be analytically grouped with its neighbor k if

producing a self-loop for node k of value

wii ≤

w2
i
2w

,

w′

kk = wii + 2wik .

When node i has no self-loop (wii = 0) this condition is always fulﬁlled, see ﬁgure 1a.

§ Note that some authors [14] have used the fact that no isolated nodes are obtained at the partition
of maximum modularity to reduce the network size, simply by obviating the existence of these nodes.
This approach clearly fails to reproduce the same modularity of the original network and provides
misleading results, it should be avoided.

widespread case of unweighted networks, all weights equal to 1, implies that in the

hh = 2 and w′

hk = 2.

Another solvable structure is the triangular hair, in which two nodes i and j have
only one link connecting them, two more links from i and j to a third node k, and
possibly self-loops. In this case, if

nodes i and j share the same community in the optimal partition and therefore may be

which can be grouped with node k if

In the particular case of nodes i and j without self-loops (wii = wjj = 0), the triangular

The treatment of directed networks requires the distinction between the nodes’ output

With these deﬁnitions at hand, the change of modularity when node i goes from

community r to community s becomes

∆Q = (˜qout

i,s + ˜qin

i,s) − (˜qout

i,r + ˜qin

i,r) ,

and the change when an isolated node i moves to any community s is

∆Q = ˜qout

i,s + ˜qin
i,s .

The ﬁrst diﬀerence between directed and undirected networks comes from the fact
that we cannot prove this time the inexistence of isolated nodes in the partition of

Since communities s1 and s2 need not be the same, the change of modularity (3.27) is
not warranted to be positive, and thus isolated nodes are possible in the partition which
maximizes modularity.

Nevertheless, there exist three kinds of nodes for which we can prove they cannot
be isolated in the optimal partition, provided their self-loops are not too large: hairs,
sinks (nodes with only input links) and sources (nodes with only output links).

Directed hairs, i.e. nodes connected only to another node, either through an input,
an output, or both links, necessarily have s1 = s2. Therefore, it is save to group them
in the same way as undirected hairs if

wii ≤

wout
i win
i
2w

.

w′

kk = wii + wik + wki .

In particular, this condition is always fulﬁlled if the hair has no self-loop (wii = 0), see
ﬁgure 2a. Whenever the self-loop is present, both input and output links are needed to
counterbalance it. The resulting self-loop w′

kk of the grouped node has value

Sink nodes i are characterized by null output strengths, wout

i = 0, which imply
˜qout
i,r = 0 for all communities r. Thus, the change of modularity (3.27) only depends on
the value of ˜qin
i,s, and (3.31) tells us that they can always be grouped with an increase
of modularity. The same property applies to sources, which are deﬁned as nodes with
null input strengths, win
i = 0. Note that sinks and sources cannot have self-loops, since
this would be in contradiction with their null output and input strengths respectively.
A triangular hair formed by a source node i and a sink node j behaves exactly as
the undirected triangular hair, being possible to group them in a single node h with a
self-loop, see ﬁgure 2b, where

4. Results and discussion

The above proofs allow us to face the problem of size reduction in complex networks
into a ﬁrm basis. In particular, this size reduction preserving modularity ensures that
the structural mesoscale found by maximizing modularity will be invariant under these
transformations. The natural question at this point is: what is the percentage in size
reduction of networks using the previous rules? To answer this question it is mandatory
to have an estimation on the number of hairs, and triangular hairs, we might expect
in complex networks.
In real networks this calculation can be performed by direct
enumeration, however an estimation can be made in terms of general grounds about the
degree distribution P (k).

Here we provide some rough estimates for the most widespread degree distributions
in natural and artiﬁcial networks: scale-free and exponential. For scale-free networks
it is usually assumed a P (k) = αk−γ, with γ ∈ [2, 3] for most of the real scale-free
complex networks. The normalization condition provides with the value of α. As a ﬁrst
approximation, neglecting the structural cut-oﬀ of the network, we can write

α

k−γ = αζ(γ) = 1

∞

Xk=1

(4.1)

where ζ(γ) is the Dirichlet series representation of the Riemman zeta function. For
values of γ ∈ [2, 3] we obtain α ∈ [1/ζ(2), 1/ζ(3)] ≈ [0.61, 0.83]. That means that,
roughly speaking, the number of hairs that corresponds to P (1) is about 83% of nodes
in a scale-free network with γ = 3 and 61% when γ = 2, although this value is slightly

and then α = eβ − 1. The percentage of hairs in this case is P (1) = 1 − e−β, that,
for example, for plausible values of β ∈ [0.5, 1.5] provides a reduction between 40% and
77% respectively.

At the light of these estimates, the size reduction process provides with an
interesting technique to confront the analysis of community structure in networks by
maximizing modularity with a substantial advantage in computational cost without
sacriﬁcing any information. We have checked our size reduction process, and posterior
optimization of modularity using Extremal Optimization (EO) [8]
in several real
networks. To enhance the accuracy of the EO algorithm, we perform a last step of
optimization consisting in to merge communities whenever modularity is increased, and
rearrange the borders (moving the nodes with the lowest modularity values and testing
them in the neighbor communities) until all the nodes are better classiﬁed and no higher
modularities, by moving one node, can be obtained. The results obtained improve those
obtained using Spectral optimization [11] and simulated annealing [9].

The networks analyzed are:

the Zachary’s karate club network [15], the Jazz
musicians network [16], the e-mail network of the University Rovira i Virgili [17],
the airports network with data about passenger ﬂights operating in the time period
November 1, 2000, to October 31, 2001 compiled by OAG Worldwide (Downers Grove,
IL) and analyzed in [18], the network of users of the PGP algorithm for secure
information transactions [19], and the Internet network at the autonomous system (AS)
level as it was in 2001 and 2006 reconstructed from BGP tables posted by the University
of Oregon Route Views Project. The results obtained are reported in Table 1.

We observe that the reduction process allows for a more exhaustive search of the
partitions’ space as expected. The speed-up of the algorithm after reduction gives
an indication of the eﬀectiveness of the process. This is also corroborated by an
improvement in modularity. We present in Table 1 the values of modularity for the
diﬀerent networks analyzed up to order 10−6. In general, the numerical resolution of
modularity is up to order mini{wi}/2w, that represents the minimal possible change in
the structure of the partitions. It means that every digit in our value of modularity is
signiﬁcant for comparison purposes.

Particularly illustrative is the analysis of the airport network. We have constructed
diﬀerent networks from the raw data, the undirected unweighted network previously
used in [18], the undirected weighted network (where the weights reﬂects the number
of passengers using the connection in the period of study), and the most realistic case
corresponding to the weighted directed network of the airports connections. These
networks allowed us to check our techniques (reduction and optimization algorithm)
in all the possible scenarios. Note that the results obtained for the weighted directed
and undirected networks in terms of modularity are very close, an explanation about
this fact that is ubiquitous in the analysis of directed networks can be found in the
Appendix.

Summarizing, we have proposed an exact procedure for size reduction in complex
networks preserving modularity. The direct consequence of its application is an
improvement in computational cost, and then accuracy, of any heuristics designed
to optimize modularity. We think that the idea of the exact reduction could be
extended to other speciﬁc motifs (building blocks) in the network, although its analytical
treatment can be further diﬃcult. The reduced network is also an appealing concept
to renormalize dynamical processes in complex networks (in the sense of real space
renormalization). With this reduction it is plausible to perform a coarse graining of the
dynamic interactions between the formed groups, we will explore this connection in a
future work.

Appendix A. Relationship between directed and undirected modularities

Let us suppose that wij are the weights of a directed weighted network, and that we
deﬁne its corresponding symmetrized (undirected) network by adding the weights matrix
to its transpose:

¯wij = wij + wji , ∀i, j .

The strengths of this undirected network are

¯wi = wout

i + win
i

,

and the total strength is

2 ¯w = 4w .

(A.1)

(A.2)

(A.3)

The modularity QD of the directed network is invariant under transposition of the
weights matrix since the input (output) strengths of the transposed network are equal
to the output (input) strengths of the original one:

wji −

δ(Ci, Cj) .

(A.4)

The relationship between the modularity QD of the directed network and the

modularity QS of its symmetrization is obtained by simple calculations:

QS =

The contribution of the links to the input and output strengths cancel if they fall
within the communities. Therefore, if most links do not cross the boundaries of the
communities, it follows that QS ≈ QD even if the network is highly asymmetric.

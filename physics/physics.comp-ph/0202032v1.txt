We apply a recently introduced method for global optimization to deter-

mine the ground state energy and conﬁguration for model metallic clusters.

The global minimum for a given N –atom cluster is found by following the

damped dynamics of the N particle system on an evolving potential energy

surface. In this application, the time dependent interatomic potential inter-

polates adiabatically between the Lennard–Jones (LJ) and the Sutton–Chen

(SC) forms. Starting with an ensemble of initial conditions corresponding

to the ground state conﬁguration of the Lennard–Jones cluster, the system

asymptotically reaches the ground state of the Sutton–Chen cluster. We de-

scribe the method and present results for speciﬁc cluster size N = 15, when

the ground state symmetry of LJN and SCN diﬀer.

I. INTRODUCTION

Determination of the lowest energy conﬁguration for a cluster of N atoms is a nontrivial

task [1,2,3,4,5]. The complexity arises in part from the exponentially (in N) large number

of minima in the potential energy surface [6]. Furthermore, the geometry of the potential

energy landscape itself can make it computationally hard.

The problem is, however, simple to describe: Find the lowest energy minimum of a N

body potential energy surface,

(~r),

V

where ~r are the atomic coordinates, and V (rij) is the interatomic potential of interaction

(~r) = X

between atoms i and j. For small N one can hope to enumerate all possible minima and

decide the lowest of these, but even for moderate N and for the simplest V such as the

Lennard–Jones (LJ) potential, this becomes diﬃcult. A case in point is the 38 atom LJ

cluster which has the so–called “double funnel” structure; the global minimum, which has

octahedral symmetry, is marginally lower than the ﬁrst excited state which has icosahedral

symmetry. These were respectively found by the basin hopping technique [7] and a genetic

algorithm method [8,9].

A number of techniques of global optimization have been applied to this problem [1,10,11]

and by now there are extensive compilations of global minima for a number of diﬀerent

clusters [12] , notably those described by two–body or many–body potentials which are

commonly applied in atomistic simulations. A major diﬃculty is in ensuring that the algo-

rithms reach the global minimum without being trapped in local minima. One method of

overcoming such trapping [13] is by transforming the PES, broadening the thermodynamic

transitions so as to increase the probability of ﬁnding the global minimum at temperatures

2

where the free energy barriers are almost unsurmountable. For example, addition of a linear

term to the PES provides a compressing eﬀect which has been shown to be successful in

locating the true minima in multiple funneled global structures [14]. Locatelli and Schoen

[15] used such transformations to locate the global minimum for non-icosahedral clusters.

We have recently proposed a new method of global optimization wherein time–dependence

is introduced in the potential energy landscape [16]. The evolving landscape is designed in

a manner such that asymptotically, the potential energy surface develops into the surface

of interest. A number of other techniques can be used to follow the evolving minima.

Applications have been made to determining the ground state conﬁgurations of simple cluster

systems [16].

In the present paper we apply this method to determine the ground state conﬁgurations

and energies of atomic clusters described by the many–body Sutton–Chen potential [17,18]

by switching from a known ground state.

In the next section we describe the method as applied to the problem of ground state

energy determination for Sutton–Chen clusters. Detailed results are presented for one cluster

size, while the more general application and results are indicated in brief. This is followed

by a discussion and summary.

It is a pleasure to dedicate this article to Steve Berry who has directly and indirectly

inﬂuenced much of the development in the area of cluster studies over the past few decades.

We have learned a lot from him, both in conversation as well as through his many articles

and reviews [19].

II. ADIABATIC OPTIMIZATION

The adiabatic optimization method [16], is a heuristic technique for locating minima.

The essential idea is as follows.

Time dependence is introduced into the potential energy landscape directly by the in-

corporation of slowly varying terms as discussed in Eq. (4). A given choice is made for the

switching functions g(t) and h(t), though in practice the choice does not aﬀect the results

greatly. A similar application of the adiabatic principle to determine semiclassical ground

states of multidimensional systems [20] has noted the insensitivity of the technique to the

precise form of the switching function, so long as the induced variation of the potential

energy surface is slow enough. We note, parenthetically, that the switching principle has

wide applicability, and in recent work has been used in the computation of the free–energy

of ﬁnite clusters [21].

Location of the evolving minima can be done by any of a number of techniques. The

simplest procedure is to introduce damping into the equations of motion and allow the

4

system to evolve to a position of rest in a potential minimum; by starting with an ensemble

of initial conﬁgurations and varying the available parameters, a number of minima can

be located, and the putative global minimum can be recognized. Elsewhere [16] we have

suggested the conjugate gradient [22] or simulated annealing (SA) [23] as other possible

methods for locating the minima. It is likely that of these, the conjugate gradient technique

will be more eﬃcient as compared to SA though some SA variants [24] may also provide a

suitable method for following the evolving minima.

The overall procedure can be summarized as follows:

1. Take the initial conﬁguration of the N atom cluster to be the ground state for the LJN

cluster [12].

2. Choose some switching function, say g(t). Similarly choose h(t), and the simplest

choice, which we make here, is h(t) = 1

g(t). We have explored a large variety of

−

switching functions and in the present application we use g(t) = cos2(3πζt) exp(

ζt),

−

where ζ is the adiabaticity parameter.

3. Perform molecular dynamics simulations for this N–particle cluster with forces deriving

from Eq. (4), with an additional damping term, namely the equations of motion

m ¨~rk + γ ˙~rk +

= 0,

k = 1, 2 . . . , N,

(5)

∂
V
∂~rk

where ~rk is the position vector for the kth particle, m is its mass and γ is the damping

constant.

4. Vary ζ and γ, keeping in mind the natural timescales of the problem. Evolve to a

minimum energy conﬁguration, namely when the particle velocities become zero; the

5

lowest energy found in an ensemble of simulations is the ground state energy predicted

by the present method.

A. Results for Sutton–Chen global minima

Here we attempt to switch from the minimum of the LJN system to the minimum of the

SCN system. Both sets of minima have been extensively studied earlier and are tabulated

in the Cambridge Cluster Database [12]. A point of interest is that for the Sutton-Chen 9-6

family of potentials, [17,18] the symmetries of the global minimum conﬁgurations are fre-

quently diﬀerent from the symmetries of the Lennard–Jones minima, so that in the adiabatic

switching process, the cluster atoms must also move so as to adopt a diﬀerent symmetry.

We present detailed results for the cluster size N = 15, though we have applied this

technique to larger clusters and obtained results in agreement with the current standards

[12]. For the 15 atom LJ cluster, the ground state has the point group symmetry C2v while

for the SC cluster the symmetry is D6d. Shown in Fig. 1 is a plot of the potential energy

versus time for a particular choice of g(t), ζ and γ. Also shown is the eﬀect of instantaneous

switching, namely taking the limit g(t) = 0, where it can be seen that the system ﬁnds the

nearest available local minimum from which it does not move. The time–dependence in the

potential eﬀectively permits the system to explore the multidimensional potential energy

landscape of the SC cluster in an eﬃcient manner. Finding a local minimum does not trap

the system since there is always kinetic energy until the adiabatic switch is essentially over.

Inset in the ﬁgure is a schematic of the cluster conﬁguration at diﬀerent times during the

process, showing how the cluster both contracts as well as rearranges to eventually reach

the minimum of the SC surface.

Iterations

FIG. 1. Plot of the potential energy versus iteration number, switching from the Lennard Jones

potential to the Sutton Chen. The switching function used is g(t) = exp(

ζt) cos2(3πζt) with

−

ζ = 0.4 and γ = 0.1. The time step is 0.01 in units natural to the LJ cluster, for which we also

take ǫ = σ = 1. At time t = 0 the cluster has the C2v symmetry. At diﬀerent times, as indicated,

the cluster conﬁguration is shown, and asymptotically, the conﬁguration reached is the 9–6 Sutton

Chen global minimum, with D6d symmetry. The parameters used for this latter model are taken

from [12]. The dashed line shows the result of the simulation in the absence of switching, namely

when the LJ potential is suddenly transformed to the Sutton Chen potential.

7

It should be added that we have performed simulations for a variety of cluster sizes and

in all cases we ﬁnd that the procedure successfully ﬁnds the tabulated minima of SC clusters;

these are not presented here since the details are repetitive. As we have emphasized else-

where [16], the present method is heuristic, and thus some exploration of diﬀerent switching

functions, variation in the adiabaticity and damping parameters, and indeed the choice of

initial potential,

0(~r) is necessary.

III. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper we have presented the outline of a general procedure for global optimization

with speciﬁc application to the problem of cluster ground state geometry determination.

The application here, to the determination of the minimum of model metallic (Sutton-

Chen) clusters by adiabatically deforming the potential energy surface relevant to model

rare–gas (Lennard Jones) clusters is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive: the

method introduced here is one of a class of techniques that employs time–dependence in

the potential energy surface to enhance the exploration of phase space in contrast to other

means of achieving the same objective [10].

A multiplicity of techniques is needed to approach hard problems such as global optimiza-

tion. Few rigorous results are available, and application of most techniques is not guaranteed,

with few possible exceptions, to give reliable (or certiﬁable) results. The present adiabatic

switching method locally solves the optimization for an evolving surface, and thus mimics

other methods of making large scale excursions in conﬁguration or phase space.

We are presently studying this technique in detail with respect to the variation of pa-

rameters as well as to functional variations. One of the main issues of concern, and one that

8

we are addressing in current work, is the relative eﬃciency of this method in comparison to

other global optimization techniques. In a number of applications, we ﬁnd that this method

gives very encouraging results, and permits the determination of fairly reliable minimum

energy conﬁgurations for a wide variety of cluster systems. The ﬂexibility of choice of a

number of starting potentials including the free particle case [16] as well as the ﬂexible

choice of switching functions and parameters, and ﬁnally the ﬂexibility in the dynamical

evolution all combine to suggest that while the method is heuristic, it holds promise.

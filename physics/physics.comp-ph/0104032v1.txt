Measurements and design equations for a two section impedance transforming hybrid suitable
for MMIC applications and a new method of synthesis for multisection branch-line hybrids are
reported. The synthesis method allows the response to be speciﬁed either of Butterworth or
Chebyshev type. Both symmetric (with equal input and output impedances) and non-symmetric
(impedance transforming) designs are feasible. Starting from a given number of sections, type of
response, and impedance transformation ratio and for a speciﬁed midband coupling, power division
ratio, isolation or directivity ripple bandwidth, the set of constants needed for the evaluation of
the reﬂection coeﬃcient response is ﬁrst calculated. The latter is used to deﬁne a driving point
impedance of the circuit, synthesize it and obtain the branch line immittances with the use of the
concept of double length unit elements (DLUE). The experimental results obtained with microstrip
hybrids constructed to test the validity of the brute force optimization and the synthesized designs
show very close agreement with the computed responses.

INTRODUCTION

implement an MMIC hybrid.

Branch line hybrids are extensively used in the
realization of a variety of microwave circuits. Balanced
mixers, data modulators, phase shifters, and power
combined ampliﬁers are some examples of such circuits.
Single section hybrids have a limited bandwidth. For
example, a single section quad hybrid with equal power
division has a bandwidth of about 15% over which
the power balance is within 0.5 dB. It is well known
that the operating bandwidth can be greatly increased
using multisection hybrids. Most applications require
also that the 50Ω input impedance be transformed to
a higher or lower impedance. A hybrid with built-in
impedance transformation is limited by the practical re-
alizability of the line impedances of the various branches.

Although a higher bandwidth may be achieved using
a coupled line conﬁguration instead of a branch line one,
coupled line hybrids are diﬃcult to realize, particularly
if microwave monolithic integrated circuits (MMIC)
implementation is used. The branch line hybrid has the
advantage that it may be realized using slot lines in
the ground plane of a microstrip circuit.
In this case
the hybrid requires virtually no additional real estate
on the chip. This may be an important consideration
when the hybrid is part of a larger MMIC circuit. At
lower microwave frequencies (5 GHz or less) a lumped
element realization similar to that of [1] may be used to

For some applications it may be suﬃcient to employ
a two section impedance transforming hybrid which has
ideal performance at the center of the desired frequency
band. Design equations for such a hybrid are derived in
the next section. A general synthesis method for multi-
section hybrids is also reported. The hybrid is in eﬀect
a four port impedance transforming structure. Synthe-
sis procedures for two port impedance transformers using
quarter wave sections to realize a Butterworth or Cheby-
shev type response are well known. The synthesis method
reported here, similar to that used by Levy and Lind [6],
is applied to the hybrid with only the two port even mode
circuit being synthesized. There are however, important
diﬀerences from [6] which are brought out in the section
on synthesis. This paper is organized as follows: In sec-
tion II we describe and analyze the performance of the
two-section broadband hybrid and in section III a gen-
eral method for the synthesis of multisection hybrids is
described. Section IV contains a comparative discussion
between the measurements, optimization and synthesis
and contains our conclusions.

II. ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
TWO-SECTION HYBRID

A two-section branch-line quadrature hybrid is shown
in Figure 1. Using odd-even mode analysis, the even
and odd mode cascade element matrices at the center
frequency are given by:

Use of the relation between cascade parameters and the
reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients [3] and applica-
tion of matching and perfect isolation conditions (S11 = 0
and S41 = 0 at the center frequency) results in:

A = DZ01/Z02, B = CZ01Z02

(2)

where Z01, Z02 are input (ports 1 and 4) and output

(ports 2 and 3) impedances respectively.

The normalized voltage waves b2 and b3 at the output
ports are given in terms of the odd and even mode trans-
mission coeﬃcient. Te and To by b2 = (Te + To)/2 and

b3 = (Te

The negative sign was retained in (5) as equation (1)
implies C2 to be a negative quantity. A relation between
the line impedances a and d is found by ﬁrst solving
for b2/c using (1), the two components of (2) and then
equating the two values of b2/c thus found. This gives:

Equations (11), (12) and (13) can be used to design
the two section hybrid with a given impedance transfor-
mation ratio r and the power ratio (coupling) k2. Note
that the ratio b/c can be chosen to be diﬀerent from
1. However, b = c gives maximum bandwidth when
the best performance at the band center is speciﬁed.
Impedances b and c are commonly chosen to be equal.

For equal power division, k = 1 and t2 = 2r2. The min-
imum value for r for non negative branch impedances is
0.5. In practice, r in the range of .7 to 1.3 for a 50Ω input
impedance gives practically realizable line impedances.
Referring to Fig.1, the computed line impedance values
of an equal power division, 50 to 35Ω two-section hybrid
are: a = 72.5Ω, b = 29.6Ω, c = 29.6Ω and d = 191.25Ω.

The computed frequency response for a 2 GHz hybrid
is shown in Fig. 2. As may be seen from this ﬁgure,
a 0.5dB output balance bandwidth of 25% is feasible.
However, the response can be further improved by com-
puter optimization.
In carrying out the optimization,
limits were placed on the impedance values in order to
yield an easily realizable design. A multisection hybrid
oﬀers the ﬂexibility of carrying out this optimization
quite eﬀectively. The T- junction discontinuity eﬀects
Such eﬀects
can also be included in the program.

become quite important at higher frequencies. Refer-
ring to Fig.
1, the optimized impedance values are:
a = 90Ω, b = 39Ω, c = 56Ω, d = 110Ω. The hybrid
was fabricated on a Rogers 5880, 0.031 inch thick
Duroid substrate. A wide band three section Chebyshev
transformer was used at the output ports to transform
the 35Ω impedance back to 50Ω for the measurement.
The computed and measured results for S12 and S13 are
shown in Fig.3 while the same for S11 and S14 are shown
in Fig.4. These results show that the agreement between
the measured and computed responses is quite close
and a 0.5dB balance bandwidth of 30% was realized
with a built-in impedance transformation from 50 to 35Ω.

The computed values for a 3dB unequal power divi-
sion, i.e. k = 0.707, non impedance transforming hybrid
are a = d = 157Ω, b = c = 29Ω. The computed frequency
response for such a hybrid is shown in Fig. 5. While the
return loss and isolation values in Fig. 5 are better than
20 dB over a 25% bandwidth, the branch line impedances
are not suitable for slotline or microstrip implemen-
tation. The circuit, however, can also be improved
with computer optimization. The optimized impedance
values are: a = 135Ω, b = 46Ω, c = 92Ω, d = 134Ω.
These impedance values are suitable for slotline imple-
mentation. The computed frequency response for the
optimized hybrid is shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen from
this ﬁgure, the hybrid performance did not degrade as a
result of optimization for realizable branch impedances.
The branch line impedances for a 6 dB unequal power
split 50Ω to 50Ω two-section hybrid did not result in
practically achievable branch line impedances for either
microstrip or slotline.

The optimized branch line impedances for a 2 GHz
50Ω to 60Ω, 3dB unequal power division hybrid are
a = 170Ω, b = 47Ω, c = 77Ω, d = 151Ω. Fig. 7 shows the
computed response of the hybrid and a 0.5dB balance
bandwidth of 30% with return loss and isolation better
than 20 dB over this bandwidth.

As a result of computer optimization, substantial im-
provement was possible for both equal and unequal power
division cases. This shows that a design for ideal perfor-
mance at the band center is not adequate when maxi-
mum possible bandwidth is required. Moreover the de-
sign equations for an impedance transforming, unequal
power division hybrid become quite complex as the num-
ber of sections increases beyond two. In the next section,
we develop a general method that can handle multisec-
tion impedance transforming hybrids and perform the
synthesis numerically. The starting point in this method
is based on the analytical approach of [6].

III. GENERAL SYNTHESIS OF A
MULTISECTION BRANCH LINE HYBRID

A general multisection branch-line hybrid is shown in
Figure 8. The synthesis problem of this four-port circuit
is equivalent to that of synthesizing the two-port even
mode circuit. Starting from a given function Γe/Te where
Γe is the even mode reﬂection coeﬃcient of the circuit and
Te the even mode transmission coeﬃcient, one can ex-
tract a cascade of double-lengths unit elements (DLUE)
and single length open circuited shunt stubs [Fig.8]. The
procedure is applicable to the Butterworth as well as the
Chebyshev response for Γe/Te.

A well-known synthesis method of two-port circuits is
the Darlington method. In this method the response is
2 = 1
speciﬁed and the losslessness condition:

2. The next step entails extraction

Γe

|
of a complex function Γe from its modulus squared. In
order to do this extraction properly, the H¨urwitz criterion
must be respected [7]. Once Γe is obtained, the driving
point impedance of the circuit Zin = (1 + Γe)/(1
Γe)
can be calculated.

The extraction of the shunt stubs and the DLUE
from Zin is done sequentially.
In the symmetric case
(Z02/Z01 = 1) the function given by Levy et al. [6] and
certiﬁed by Riblet [5] was used. However, we diﬀer in
the way we adapt the Darlington synthesis to the extrac-
tion of the individual elements. For instance, the formula
used to extract the ﬁrst shunt stub a1 is:

a1 =

1
Z 2

(

)
s=1

(14)

where s is Richard’s variable. The DLUE is extracted
by a sequential extraction of two single length unit ele-
ments (SLUE). A condition for the extraction of a SLUE
is [7]:

Zin(s =

1) =

Zin(s = 1)

(15)

After an SLUE is extracted,

the driving point

impedance becomes:

in(s) = Zin(1)[

]

−

(16)

For the sequential extraction to work it is necessary
that the transformed impedance satisﬁes (15). Further,
Zin(1) has to be equal to Z ′
in(1) for the two extracted
values to be same. This is a signiﬁcant variation from
the method used in [6]. Finally, the last shunt stub is
extracted from a straight division of the denominator by
the numerator of the last Zin. In the asymmetric case, we
use the function Γe/Te given in [4] and proceed exactly
as in the symmetric case. In this case Z02/Z01 = r where
r
= 1, the function Γe/Te for an (n-1)-section hybrid is
given by:

In the Butterworth
case, Xc = 1 and the polynomial function Pn−1(X/Xc)
is given by X (n−1) with X = (1 + s2)/(1
s2). Only one
parameter (K) needs to be determined from the speciﬁ-
cation of a given value for the midband coupling (inciden-
tally, the same procedure applies for speciﬁed midband
power division ratio or isolation). The value of K is nu-
merically found as the root of the following equation:

the speciﬁed type of response is Chebyshev, while a good
isolation is obtained at midband (-20 dB), a zero power
division ratio could not be obtained. This happens if a
wide band, good isolation and impedance transformation
ratio of 0.7 are simultaneously required. The actual
power division ratio obtained is around -5 dB. When any
of these conditions is relaxed the required solution exists
and is shown in Fig. 10 for the Butterworth case and
in Fig. 11 for the modiﬁed Chebyshev case as explained
below.

The modiﬁed Chebyshev approach consists of calculat-
ing the parameters K and Xc by ﬁrst assuming r = 1.
Once the ai’s and bi’s are obtained, the S parameters
with the actual value of r are calculated. The frequency
response is displayed in Fig. 11. The required power
division ratio (almost 0 dB) as well as good isolation
(around -22.5 dB) were obtained. Experimental veriﬁ-
cation of the synthesized design was done by fabricating
a microstrip hybrid on a 0.031 inch thick Duroid sub-
strate. The measured responses displayed in Fig.11 in-
dicate a very close agreement with the synthesis. The
second example of Chebyshev type is the wide band two
section impedance transformer (50Ω to 60 Ω) with spec-
iﬁed - 3dB power division at midband. This hybrid was
optimized and the results were presented in Fig.7.
In
Fig. 12, all the S parameters for the Chebyshev synthe-
sized hybrid are presented.
In this case, the resulting
impedance values are: a1 = 161.31Ω, a2 = 55.37Ω, a3 =
125.94Ω, b1 = 39.96Ω, b2 = 36.28Ω. The power division
ratio was obtained from the synthesis as required (-3 dB)
but a poor isolation (-15 dB) at midband was found. In
contrast, the Butterworth synthesis is shown in Fig. 13.
Synthesis was also done with the modiﬁed Chebyshev
method mentioned above and the results are shown in
Fig. 14. As may be seen, this modiﬁed method resulted
in quite a reasonable response with an isolation better
than 20dB.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The reference parameter X2 corresponds to the
frequency where the directivity falls by 20dB from its
value at Xc. Once the parameters Xc and K have
been determined from the speciﬁcations, one proceeds
to the determination of the ai’s and bi’s. We are now
in a position to make detailed comparisons with the
measurements and optimization as well. The ﬁrst ex-
ample we tackle is the wideband two section impedance
transformer (50Ω to 35Ω) with speciﬁed zero power
division at midband. Optimization and measurements
are compared for this hybrid in Figs 3 and 4 while
synthesis results are shown in Figs 9 and 10. We
display all the S parameters for both Butterworth and
Chebyshev types of response. The resulting impedance
values in the Chebyshev case are: a1 = 157.50Ω, a2 =
85.05Ω, a3 = 99.88Ω, b1 = 39.49Ω, b2 = 33.49Ω. When

Design equations for a two section impedance trans-
forming quad hybrid were derived. Using these equations
a two section branch line hybrid can be designed to
achieve a percentage bandwidth of 30% with impedance
transformation by a factor of
.7 to 1.3. Over this
bandwidth the power balance between the output ports
is measured better than 0.5 dB. A two section branch
line hybrid with 3dB unequal power division also has
a 30% bandwidth but the impedance transformation
ratio range drops to [0.833 - 1.2]. A slotline/lumped
implementation of such a hybrid is attractive for MMIC
circuits. In addition, a new general synthesis method for
a multisection hybrid with Butterworth or Chebyshev
response is described. Both symmetric (with equal
input and output
impedances) and non-symmetric
(impedance transforming) designs were demonstrated.

A close agreement between the synthesized, optimized
and measured results were obtained.

The Coulomb problem for continuous charge distributions is a central problem in physics. Powerful
methods, that scale linearly with system size and that allow us to use diﬀerent resolutions in diﬀerent
regions of space are therefore highly desirable. Using wavelet based Multi Resolution Analysis we
derive for the ﬁrst time a method which has these properties. The power and accuracy of the
method is illustrated by applying it to the calculation of of the electrostatic potential of a full
three-dimensional all-electron Uranium dimer.

The theory of wavelets1,2 is one of the most impor-
tant recent development in mathematics. It allows one
to apply a multi-scale analysis to problems that exhibit
widely varying length scales1. Problems with this fea-
ture abound in all ﬁelds of physics. The problem we
want to address here is the classical Coulomb problem
for a continuous charge distribution ρ, i.e. we want to
solve Poisson’s equation

∇2V = −4πρ

(1)

under the constraint that the potential V vanishes at in-
ﬁnity. This basic equation can be found in nearly any
ﬁeld of physics and it is therefore essential to have eﬃ-
cient solution methods for it. There are two important
requirements for an algorithm that solves this problem.
First it should scale linearly with the size of the charge
distribution. Since in numerical applications the charge
distribution is given on a grid a measure for the size of the
charge distribution is the number of grid points necessary
to represent it. This linear scaling property is of utmost
importance because in many applications one needs grids
consisting of a very large number of grid points. Second,
it should allow for grids that are nonuniform, i.e. that
have higher resolution in regions where this is required.
For discrete charge distributions several algorithms4 with
these two properties exist and have become a standard for
simulations of large coulombic and gravitational particle
systems. For continuous charge distributions proposals
have been put forward to map the continuous problem
onto a discrete and use the above mentioned algorithms
for discrete systems5. To the best of our knowledge, there
exists however no linear scaling algorithm for nonuniform
grids that can directly be applied to continuous charge
distributions. If one constrains oneself to uniform grids
and periodic boundary conditions, there are of course the
well known Fourier techniques6, that show a nearly lin-
ear N log2(N ) scaling with respect to the number of grid
points N . Non-periodic boundary conditions can be im-
plemented in the context of Fourier techniques only by
cutting oﬀ the long range Coulomb potential3. Finite

element methods allow nonuniform grids, but grid gen-
eration and preconditioning pose severe problems. Using
a basis of wavelet functions, we will present in this pa-
per a method that scales strictly linear and allows for
nonuniform grids.

There are many families of wavelets and one has to
choose the most appropriate one for a speciﬁc applica-
tion. A widely used family are the compactly supported
orthogonal wavelets of Daubechies2. The orthogonality
property is convenient if one has to expand an arbitrary
function in a basis of wavelets. Their disadvantage is
that they are not very smooth, i.e. only a small num-
ber of derivatives is continuous. One can however con-
struct families of nonorthogonal wavelets that are much

smoother.
cal values on a grid to the expansion coeﬃcients of the
wavelet basis is rather complicated and slow for biorthog-
onal wavelets2. An exception are the second generation
interpolating wavelets7, whose special properties allow us
to do this mapping easily. In addition they give rise to a
particularly fast wavelet transform8.

Wavelets have already been successfully applied in sev-
eral areas of physics9. In the context of electronic struc-
ture calculations a fairly small wavelet basis can describe
the widely varying scales of both core and valence elec-
trons10. Self-consistent electronic structure calculations
have also been done11. In these self-consistent calcula-
tions the solution of Poisson’s equation was however done
by traditional Fourier techniques.

Let us now brieﬂy review the theory behind biorthogo-
nal wavelets2. As in ordinary orthogonal wavelet theory
there are two fundamental functions, the scaling function
φ and the wavelet ψ. In the biorthogonal case there are
however still the complementary scaling function ˜φ and
the complementary wavelet ˜ψ. Each scaling function and
wavelet belongs to a hierarchical level of resolution. By
analysing a function with respect to these diﬀerent lev-
els of resolution one can do a so-called Multi Resolution
Analysis (MRA). The space belonging to a certain level
of resolution k is spanned by all the integer translations

Since the scaling functions and their complementary
counterparts are orthogonal < φk,i(x) | ˜φk,j (x) >= δij,
the expansion coeﬃcients si,k are given by

si,k =< f (x) | ˜φi,k(x) > .

(3)

The expansion 2 becomes more accurate if one goes to
a higher level of resolution, i.e. if one decreases k and it
becomes exact in the limit k → −∞. This is an impor-
tant feature because it allows us to improve systemati-
cally the numerical accuracy in very much the same way
as it is done with a basis of plane waves. In numerical
application it is of course not possible to take this limit,
and we will therefore denote the ﬁnest level of resolution
that is used in the calculation by k = 0

The scaling function satisﬁes a reﬁnement relation

i.e. each scaling function of a lower resolution level can
be expressed as a linear combination of higher resolution
scaling functions. It is obviously not possible to express
a scaling function of higher resolution by a linear com-
bination of lower resolution scaling functions only. One
can, however, write down such an expression if one still
includes the wavelets ψi,k(x) ∝ ψ(( 1

The wavelets at level k thus reintroduces the resolution
that is lost as one goes from level k to level k + 1 scaling
functions. These transformation properties among the
scaling functions and wavelets give rise to the wavelet
transform. The wavelet expansion coeﬃcients di,k are
then either deﬁned by this transform or equivalently by
an expression analogous to Eq. 3.

Eq. 6 is called a forward fast wavelet transform, Eq. 7
being its inverse counterpart. If one has periodic bound-
ary conditions for the data si,k the wavelet transform
is one-to-one transformation between si,k and its spec-
tral decompositions si,k+1 and di,k+1. To obtain a full
wavelet spectral analysis the forward transform is ap-
plied recursively. In consecutive steps the output data

si,k+1 of the previous forward transform are the input
data for the next transform. The size of the data set to
be transformed is thus cut into half in each step. The
total operation count is then given by a geometric series
and scales therefore strictly linear. A full wavelet syn-
thesis consists in the same way of a sequence of inverse
transforms and gives back the original data set si,k. The
coeﬃcients hi and gi and their complementary counter-
parts ˜hi , ˜gi are ﬁlters of ﬁnite length 2m and can be
derived from the MRA requirements2. The 8-th order
lifted Lazy scaling function and wavelet8 that were used
in this work are shown in Fig.1. Because it can repre-
sent polynomials up to degree 8 exactly, the expansion
coeﬃcients with respect to the wavelets di,k decay very
rapidly for any smooth function with decreasing k.

To do a multidimensional MRA, we use a scheme de-
scribed by Daubechies2. Even though all this work was
done in the three-dimensional case, we will illustrate the
principle just for the two-dimensional case. The space of
all scaling functions of resolution level k is given by

φi,j,k(x, y) = φi,k(x)φj,k(y)

(8)

The wavelet space is again deﬁned as the space that rec-
ompensates for the resolution that is lost by going up
one level in the scaling functions space. Using Eq. 5 one
obtains three kind of terms for the wavelet space

ψ01
ψ10
ψ11

i,j,k(x, y) = φi,k(x)ψj,k(y)
i,j,k(x, y) = ψi,k(x)φj,k(y)
i,j,k(x, y) = ψi,k(x)ψj,k(y)

Let us now explain how to solve Poisson’s equation in
wavelets. Expanding both the charge density and the
potential in Eq 1 into scaling functions

ρ(x, y, z) =

ρi,j φi,k(x) φj,k(y)

V (x, y, z) =

Lk

Since the scaling functions have a ﬁnite support, the
matrix Lk is a sparse matrix and its nonzero elements
i1,i2;j1,j2 can be calculated analytically12. The natural
Lk
boundary conditions for this scheme are periodic bound-
ary conditions. As we stressed in the introduction, we
however want to solve Poisson’s equation 1 with non-
periodic boundary conditions. As is well known, bound-
ary aﬀects vanish whenever the boundary is suﬃciently
far away. Thus, one could in principle obtain natural
boundary conditions (i.e. V (r) → 0 if r → ∞) within
arbitrary precision if one uses a suﬃciently large peri-
odic box. Since the electrostatic potential decays fairly
slowly a very large box is required and the numerical ef-
fort would be tremendous if one uses equally spaced grids
within this huge periodic computational box. Far away
from the charge distribution the variation of the potential
is however small and less resolution is needed. The key
idea is therefore to use a set of hierarchical grids as shown
in Fig.2. where the resolution decreases as on goes out of
the center. Expressed in the terms of wavelet theory this
means that on the highest (periodic) level we have a ba-
sis of scaling functions. Resolution is then increased by
adding wavelet basis functions near the center. By doing
this repeatedly we obtain increasing resolution towards
the center as shown in Fig.2.

Up to now the motivation for introducing grids of dif-
ferent resolution was to handle the natural boundary
conditions. Additional levels of resolution can however
be introduced to handle charge distributions that have
diﬀerent length scales and require therefore higher res-
olution in some parts of space. The theory of wavelets
gives us also enough ﬂexibility to increase the resolution
not only around one center but around any number of
centers in the computational box.

A full wavelet synthesis step can be done straightfor-
wardly in this hierarchical grid setting. Any wavelet can

resolution levels in a region of low resolution, one ob-
tains however a highly redundant data set. To do a full
wavelet analysis that brings back the original spectral
decomposition data, it turns out that one needs actually
a slightly redundant data set. In order to calculate the
wavelet coeﬃcients for a wavelet at a boundary to a lower
resolution region, one needs the scaling function values
corresponding to this higher resolution also in a strip of
width m in the lower resolution region. A schematic dia-
gram of a full hierarchical wavelet analysis and synthesis
is shown in Fig.3.

FIG. 3. A schematic representation of a multi hierarchy
wavelet synthesis. Data regions denoted by s,d01,d10 and d11
contain expansion coeﬃcients for basis functions of the type
given by Eq. 8, 9, 10 and 11 respectively. CP stand for a copy
step where one puts an additional layer of zeroes around the
data set. SYN denotes a one level wavelet synthesis step. One
starts the process at the coarsest (periodic) level and proceeds
down to the ﬁnest resolution level. To do a multi hierarchy
wavelet analysis one proceeds back up reversing all the copy
operations and replacing the single level synthesis steps by
analysis steps.

In this mixed representation, where one has scaling
functions at the highest periodic level and wavelets all
the reﬁnement levels, the structure of the Laplace oper-
ator is much more complicated since one has coupling
between all the hierarchical levels. An elegant way to
cope with this additional complexity is the so-called non-
standard operator form proposed by Beylkin, Coifman
and Rokhlin13, which allows us to incorporate this cou-
pling by a sequence of wavelet transforms (Fig.3), that
are interleaved with the application of a simple one-level
Laplace operator. For this one-level Laplace operator
only the matrix elements of the Laplace operator among
scaling functions and wavelets on the same resolution
level, but not between diﬀerent levels of resolution are
needed.

Mathematically the nonstandard operator form is a
telescopic expansion of the Laplace operator in the scal-
ing function basis at the ﬁnest level L0.
If we deﬁne
projection operators Pk and Qk, that project the whole
space into the space of scaling functions and wavelets at
the k-th level as well as their complementary counter-
parts ˜Pk and ˜Qk, they satisfy

Pk = Pk+1 + Qk+1

;

˜Pk = ˜Pk+1 + ˜Qk+1

(16)

and we may write

Lk = ˜Pk L0 Pk = ( ˜Qk+1 + ˜Pk+1) L0 (Qk+1 + Pk+1)
DD + Lk+1

SD + Lk+1

DS + Lk+1

= Lk+1

(17)

DD , Lk+1

SD , Lk+1

where Lk+1
DS are Laplace operators at the
(k + 1)th level representing the coupling of wavelets
with wavelets, wavelets with scaling functions and scal-
ing functions with wavelets. Applying Eq. 17 recursively
for k = 0, 1, . . ., one obtains the nonstandard operator
form.

In the basis of the wavelet functions at diﬀerent reso-
lution levels a simple diagonal preconditioning scheme is
very eﬃcient and we were able to reduce the residue by
one order of magnitude with only 3 iterations.

To demonstrate the power of this method we applied
it to a problem that can hardly be solved by any other
methods, namely the potential arising from the nucle-
onic and electronic charge distribution of a fully three-
dimensional all-electron Uranium dimer. The charge
distribution of the nucleus was represented by a Gaus-
1
sian charge distribution with an extension of
2000 atomic
units. Since the valence electrons have an extension
which is of the order of one atomic unit, we have length
scales that diﬀer by more than 3 orders of magnitude.
As can be seen from Fig.4, the potential also varies by
many orders of magnitude. Using 22 hierarchical levels in
our algorithm, we can represent resolutions that diﬀer by
7 orders of magnitude and we are able to calculate the
potential with at least 6 signiﬁcant digits in the whole
region from the nucleus to the valence region. In order
to be able to determine the error we actually ﬁrst ﬁtted
the electronic charge distribution by a small number of
Gaussians, whose exact potential can be calculated ana-
lytically. This rather crude charge density was then used
in all the calculations.

We also applied the method to clusters containing
several CO molecules that were described by pseudo-
potentials.
In this case there is only one length scale
associated with the charge distribution and it is possible
to reduce the number of grid points on higher levels such
that the total amount of work increases only slightly with
additional hierarchies. We were able to calculate the po-
tential corresponding to the non-periodic boundary con-
ditions with 8 signiﬁcant digits.

We thank Mike Teter and Leonid Zaslavsky for bring-
ing the beauty and usefulness of wavelets to our atten-
tion. Jurg Hutter pointed out several essential references

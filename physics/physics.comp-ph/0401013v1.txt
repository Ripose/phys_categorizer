Existence of Dynamical Scaling in the Temporal Signal of Time Projection Chamber

A. K. Mohanty, D. Favretto, F. Carminati and K. Safarik
CERN,
1211, Geneva, Switzerland

The temporal signals from a large gas detector may show dynamical scaling due to many correlated
space points created by the charged particles while passing through the tracking medium. This has
been demonstrated through simulation using realistic parameters of a Time Projection Chamber
(TPC) being fabricated to be used in ALICE collider experiment at CERN. An interesting aspect
of this dynamical behavior is the existence of an universal scaling which does not depend on the
multiplicity of the collision. This aspect can be utilised further to study physics at the device level
and also for the online monitoring of certain physical observables including electronics noise which
are a few crucial parameters for the optimal TPC performance.

Dynamical scaling refers here to powerlaw distribution
or a powerlaw with an exponential cut-oﬀ that describes
certain correlation phenomena in the dynamical systems
distinctly being diﬀerent from the random statistical pro-
cesses. In the thermodynamical context, it describes a
critical phenomena associated with the phase transition
[1] while in many other complex systems it corresponds
to the so called self organised criticality [2]. Although a

powerlaw distribution (f

ical feature, a powerlaw with an additional exponential
αx) makes the distribution normalizable for
(f
all values of β (where α and β are positive constants) and
also many real world systems like World Wide Web and
social networks show this cut-oﬀ [3]. In this paper, we
show the presence of both type of scalings, a powerlaw
and a powerlaw with exponential in the temporal signals
(comprising of time gap and bunch length distributions)
of a large Time Projection Chamber (TPC) which is a
type of gas detector used for three dimensional track-
ing of the charged particles passing through it during a
particle physics experiment. The time gap distribution
along the drift direction shows a dynamical scaling which
is independent of the multiplicity of the collisions above
a critical value. While this scaling behavior itself is an
interesting aspect to investigate the correlation phenom-
ena in a gas detector at the device level, it can be further
utilised for online monitoring of certain important TPC
parameters including the constant rise in electronics noise
level due to long exposure to radiation.

The TPC is the main tracking device of the ALICE (A
Large Ion Collider Experiment) [4] at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at CERN optimized for the study of
5.5
heavy ion collisions at a centre of mass energy
ATeV. It is a large gas ﬁlled detector of cylindrical de-
sign with an inner radius of about 80 cm, an outer radius
of about 250 cm, and an over all length in the beam direc-
tion of 500 cm. A charged particle passing through the
gas volume creates electrons by ionization. The electrons
drift in the electric ﬁeld towards the read out chambers
(multiwire proportional counters with more than 550000
cathode pads read out located at the two end-caps of the
TPC cylinder) where they are ampliﬁed in the ﬁeld of the
sense wires by a factor of several 104. This signal is cou-
pled to the read out pads which are on ground potential

−

S/D)/D where D = (Nprimf )−

and at a few milimeters distance behind the sense wire-
plane. The detail aspect of the design and simulation re-
sults can be found in ref [5]. For simulation, the charged
particles (mostly pions) with diﬀerent multiplicities are
generated using HIJING parametrization corresponding
to P b + P b collisons at 5.5 ATeV. The simulation is car-
ried out using a microscopic simulator [6] incorporated
in ALIROOT which is a GEANT3.21 and ROOT based
simulation package used by the ALICE collaboration [7].
While we refer to [6] for deatil, in the following we
brieﬂy mention the salient features of the simulation.
The ionization in the gas proceeds in two stages. Firstly,
the electromagnetic interactions of the primary particles
with the TPC gas (90% Ne and 10% CO2) lead to the
release of primary electrons with a statistics that follows
a Poisson distribution. Thus, the distance S between two
successive collisons leading to primary ionization can be
simulated through an exponential distribution given by
1 is the mean dis-
exp(
tance between primary ionizations, Nprim is the number
of primary electrons per cm produced by a Minimum Ion-
izing Particle (MIP) and f is the Bethe-Bloch curve. At
suﬃcient kinetic energy, the primary electrons produce
secondaries creating an electron cluster with a total num-
Ipot)Wi +1 where
ber of electrons given by Ntot = (Etot −
Etot is the energy loss in a given collision, Wi is the eﬀec-
tive energy required to produce an electron-ion pair and
Ipot is the ﬁrst ionization potential. The electron clus-
ter which is assumed to be point like undergoes diﬀusion
while drifting towards the end-cap which is described by
a three dimensional Gaussian with widths δT = DT √Ld
and δL = DL√Ld where DT and DL are transverse and
longitudinal diﬀusion constants and Ld is the total drift
distance. An electron arriving at the anode wire creates
an avalanche which induces a charge on the pad plane.
The time signal is obtained by folding the avalanche with
the shaping function of the pre-ampliﬁer/shaper with a
200 ns which is a compromise between
shaping time
the need for achieving a high signal to noise ratio and
for avoiding overlap of successive signals. This signal is
sampled with a frequency
5.66 M Hz which divides
∼
the total drift time of 88 µs into about 500 time bins.
The microscopic simulator also takes into account the
electron loss in the drift gas due to presence of electron

few typical parameters which are used in the simulations
are given in table I. Although, we concentrate only on the
TPC data, all component of the ALICE detectors as well
as all passive materials are included in the simulation so
as to create a situation close to the real experiment.

In ALTRO data format, zero suppressed data is
recorded for each pad over all the time bins. This means,
if we call bunch a group of adjacent over threshold sam-
ples coming from one pad, the signal can be represented
bunch by bunch. Figure 1 shows a typical plot of time bin
versus amplitude for a given pad. Since the data is zero
suppressed, it is suﬃcient to record three types of data,
the sample amplitude in a given bunch, the bunch length
and the time gap between two consecutive bunches. The
amplitude distribution gives the energy loss spectrum
with a long Landau tail and is not illuminating for the
present purpose. Therefore, in the following, we will con-
sider only the time gap and bunch length distributions
built over all the pads.

The time gap distribution corresponds to the distance
between two trajectories along the drift direction (say
z-direction). Figure 2 shows the plot of time gap dis-
tribution at diﬀerent multiplicities (M = 20000, 40000,
60000 and 80000). Although, the tail of the distribu-
tion is linear (in the semi-log scale) and depends on M
as expected, it deviates from the linearity at the shorter
distances. The above behavior can be described by a
distribution of the type,

are the best ﬁt obtained using Eq.(1) with diﬀerent α and β
values as shown in ﬁgure 3.

Figure 3 shows the parameters β (ﬁlled circles in the
left) and α (ﬁlled circles on the right) extracted from
ﬁtting the simulated data points. Note that α is a sta-
tistical parameter which has a near linear dependence
on the multiplicty M . However, the index β increases
with M and becomes a (nearly) constant at higer M val-
ues. We will show below that this index is responsible
for the dynamical scaling which does not depend on ex-
ternal parameters like multiplicity M or magnetic ﬁeld
B above a critical value but depends on certain intrin-
sic TPC parameters. Another interesting observation is
that the product ω = ¯zα also changes very slowly with M
above a critical value of M
30000. In order to appre-
∼
ciate the eﬀect of dynamical scaling, we can plot ﬁgure
2 in a reduced scale by dividing z by ¯z and multiplying
f by ¯z/A in Eq.(1). By this rescaling, the index β will
not change, but α will be rescaled to say ω = α¯z. Since
β and ω are (approximately) independent of M above a
certain value, the rescaled distributions will merge with
each other as shown in ﬁgure 4. The solid curve is the ﬁt
of the type f (z)

KNO scaling [9] which says that at high energies s, the
probability distributions Pn(s) of producing n particles
in a certain collision process should exhibit the scaling re-
lation ¯nPn(s) = f (n/¯n). This scaling hypothesis asserts
that if we rescale Pn(s) measured at diﬀerent energies via
streching (shrinking) the vertical (horizontal) axes by ¯n,
the rescaled curves will coincide with each other. In the
present case, the observed scaling is identical to KNO
scaling if we replace energy s by the multiplicity M and
¯n by average distance ¯z although both corresponds to
two diﬀerent physical situations.

Apart from this striking similarity with KNO, this
rescaling is an elegant way to remove the statistical de-
pendency from the dynamical behavior. It may be men-
tioned here that such type of scaling is also expected in
case of an exponential distribution when the exponent α
is small . Under such limit (α << 1), since the average

ω = α¯z
1 (The ω value may become more than unity if
α is large). However, the interesting aspect of the present
scaling is the deviation from unity and also having same
ω at all M . This means ω deviates from unity due to
presence of the dynamical exponent β. In absence of β,
the scaling would have followed the linear behaviour in
the semi-log scale as shown by the dashed curve in ﬁg-
ure 4. Therefore, both β and η = 1
ω are dynamical
exponents whose values do not depend on M .

In the following, we investigate the origin of this dy-
namical behavior and also the parameters that aﬀect its
values. The origin of this dynamical phenomena can
be associated with the set of measurements which are
strongly correlated. Although, at a given interaction
point, the creation of primary electrons due to ioniza-
tion is a random statistical process, the set of interac-
tion points created by a single charged particles passing
through the TPC are well correlated. Obviously, this cor-

3

relation will depend on the multiplicty M and also on the
number of measurements (number of pads, size etc). De-
pending on these parameters, a critical value is reached
beyond which the correlation becomes independent of M .

Although, the dynamical behavior may depend on
other geometrical TPC parameters, in this study, we do
not intend to change any such parameters as they have
been optimized based on certain physics criteria. How-
ever, we can see the eﬀect of other relatively softer pa-

electronic noise. Since the produced electron clouds are
broadened in transverse direction due to increased DT ,
the correlation eﬀect is also enhanced. It is found that
increasing DT by a factor of two, ω reduces only from
0.67 to 0.62. Further increase in DT has very little eﬀect
on ω.

On the other hand, noise above the threshold reduces
the correlation eﬀect as it acts as an additional random
source of electrons. As shown in ﬁgure 5, the middle
curve is obtained with the parameters as given in the
tablei (reﬀered as default parameters), while the upper
curve corresponds to DT twice the default value and the
lower curve is due to an increased noise level from 1000 e
to 2000 e. The correlation eﬀect is lost due to noisy sig-
nal for which ω
1. With increased noise level ω rises
above unity (slowly) which is typical of an exponential
behavior. Note that the dynamical parameters like DT ,
DL and drift velocity etc are expected to vary within
< 4% during operation. This small ﬂuctuation does not
eﬀect the ω value. On the otherhand, noise is quite un-
predictable and also may go up due to the exposure of
the electronics to the radiation for an extended period.

In conclusion, the time gap distribution shows an
universal scaling behavior (KNO type) (at suﬃciently
large multiplicity) with an exponent deviating from unity.
This is an interesting aspect to study the correlation phe-
nomena in gas detector and also to understand physics
(more explicitly, the physics that has gone into simula-
tion) at the device level. An important pratical utility of
this phenomena is the utilization of the above scaling ex-
ponent to monitor the noise level above a given threshold
without any computational complexity and also without
building any rigorous models. In that sense, this analyses
provide a model independent way to monitor the quality
of the data what is being recorded.

So far, we have discussed only about the time gap dis-
tribution. The tail of the bunch length distribution also
γ as shown in ﬁg-
shows a powerlaw behaviour
ure 6(a). Since the tail of the bunch length distribution
corresponds to low energy electrons and delta rays, the
exponent γ is quite sensitive to the applied magnetic ﬁeld
(up to some limit). Figure 6(b) shows the bunch length
distributions at diﬀerent B values. May be this exponent
can be used to monitor the magnetic ﬁeld setting during
the operation. Apart from this, we have not found the de-
pendency of γ on any other dynamical TPC parameters
which could have been utilized for online monitoring.

We would like to add here that the powerlaw exponent
that aﬀect the time gap distribution corresponds to a re-
gion of short distances. Therefore, it is very diﬃcult to
extract the β parameters acurately and also ﬁtting the
time gap distribution with other functional forms like two
exponentials can not be ruled out. However, we have seen
that the quality of ﬁt is much better with powerlaw ex-
ponent. Further, as we have argued before, dynamical
phenomena is expected in side a TPC due to many cor-
related interaction points. The tail of the bunch length
distribution having a perfect powerlaw behavior reﬂects
this aspect rather unambiguously. Due to the same dy-
namical origin, it is reasonable to assume a powerlaw
with exponential cutoﬀ for time gap distribution as well.
We would also like to add here that the KNO type of
scaling found in case of time gap distribution is indepen-
dent of any ﬁtting procedure and the deviation of the
slope from unity is an indication that the noise level has
remained below the threshold. This we consider as an
important observation of this analyses irrespective of the

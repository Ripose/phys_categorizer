Ultrathin magnetic ﬁlms can be modeled as an anisotropic Heisenberg model with long range dipo-
lar interactions. It is believed that the phase diagram presents three phases: A ordered ferromagnetic
phase (I), a phase characterized by a change from out-of-plane to in-plane in the magnetization (II),
and a high temperature paramagnetic phase (III). It is claimed that the border lines from phase
I to III and II to III are of second order and from I to II is ﬁrst order. In the present work we
have performed a very careful Monte Carlo simulation of the model. Our results strongly support
that the line separating phase II and III is of the BKT type.

INTRODUCTION

Since the late 80’s there has being an increasing inter-
est in ultrathin magnetic ﬁlms [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This inter-
est is mainly associated to the development of magnetic-
non-magnetic multilayers for the purpose of giant mag-
netoresistence applications [7]. In addition, experiments
on epitaxial magnetic layers have shown that a huge va-
riety of complex structures can develop in the system
[8, 9, 10, 11]. Rich magnetic domain structures like
stripes, chevrons, labyrinths and bubbles associated to
the competition between dipolar long range interactions
and strong anisotropies perpendicular to the plane of the
ﬁlm were observed experimentally. A lot of theoretical
work has been done on the morphology and stability of
these magnetic structures [12, 13, 14]. Beside that, it
has been observed the existence of a switching transi-
tion from perpendicular to in-plane ordering at low but
ﬁnite temperature [15, 16, 17, 18]: at low temperature
the ﬁlm magnetization is perpendicular to the ﬁlm sur-
face, as temperature rises the magnetization ﬂips to an
in-plane conﬁguration. Eventually the out-of-plane and
the in plane magnetization become zero [19].

The general Hamiltonian describing a prototype for a
ultrathin magnetic ﬁlm assumed to lay in the xy plane is

structures developed in the system depend on the sam-
ple geometry and size. Several situations are discussed
in reference [14] and citations therein.
Although the structures developed in the system are well
known the phase diagram of the model is still being stud-
ied. There are several possibilities since we can combine
the parameters in many ways. We want to analyze the
case J > 0 in some interesting situations. A more de-
tailed analysis covering the entire space of parameters is
under consideration.

• Case D = 0

For D = 0 we recover the two dimensional (2d)
anisotropic Heisenberg model. The isotropic case,
is known to present no transition [21].
A = 0,
For A > 0 the model is in the Ising universality
class [20] undergoing a order-disorder phase transi-
tion. If A < 0 the model is in the XY universality
class. In this case it is known to have a Berezinskii-
Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT ) phase transition which
is characterized by a vortex-anti-vortex unbinding,
with no true long range order [22, 23, 24, 25].

• Case D 6= 0

In this case, there is a competition between the
dipolar and the anisotropic terms.
If D is small
compared to A we can expect the system to have an
Ising behavior. If D is not too small we can expect
a transition of the spins from out-of-plane to in-
plane conﬁguration [17]. For large enough D out-
of-plane conﬁgurations become instable such that,
the system lowers its energy by turning the spins
into an in-plane anti-ferromagnetic arrangement.

Earlier works on this model which discuss the phase dia-
gram were mostly done using renormalization group ap-
proach and numerical Monte Carlo simulation [17, 19,
26]. They agree between themselves in the main features.
The phase diagram for ﬁxed A and J = 1 is schemati-
cally shown in ﬁgure 1 in the space (D, T ). From Monte
Carlo (MC) results it is found that there are three re-
gions labelled in the ﬁgure 1 as I, II and III. Phase I
correspond to an out-of-plane magnetization, phase II
has in-plane magnetization and phase III is paramag-
netic. The border line between phase I to phase II is

spacing, as suggested in the work of Santamaria and co-
workers [17].

We have performed the simulations for temperatures
in the range 0.3 ≤ T ≤ 1.2 at intervals of ∆T = 0.1.
When necessary this temperature interval is reduced to
∆T = 0.01. For every temperature the ﬁrst 5 × 105 MC
steps per spin were used to lead the system to equilib-
rium. The next 106 conﬁgurations were used to calcu-
late thermal averages of thermodynamical quantities of
interest. We have divided these last 106 conﬁgurations
in 20 bins from which the error bars are estimated from
the standard deviation of the averages over these twenty
runs. The single-site anisotropy constant was ﬁxed as A
= 1.0 while the D parameter was set to 0.10, 0.15 and
0.20. In this work the energy is measured in units of JS2
and temperature in units of JS2/kB, where kB is the
Boltzmann constant.

To estimate the transition temperatures we use ﬁnite-
size-scaling (FSS) analysis to the results of our MC sim-
ulations. In the following we summarize the main FSS
properties. If the reduced temperature is t = (T − Tc)/T ,
the singular part of the free energy, is given by

F (L, T ) = L−(2−α)/νF (tL1/ν)

(2)

Appropriate diﬀerentiation of F yields the various ther-
modynamic properties. For an order disorder transition
exactly at Tc the magnetization, M , susceptibility, ξ and
speciﬁc heat, C, behave respectively as [31, 32].

M ∝ L−β/ν
χ ∝ L−γ/ν
C ∝ L−α/ν.

U4 = 1 −

< m4 >
3 < m2 >2 .

In addition to these an important quantity is the forth
order Binder’s cumulant

For large enough L, curves for U4(T ) cross the same
point U ∗ at T = Tc. For a BKT transition the quan-
tities deﬁned above behave in a diﬀerent way. Due to the
Mermin-Wagner theorem there is no spontaneous mag-
netization for any ﬁnite temperature. The speciﬁc heat
present a peak at a temperature which is slightly higher
than TBKT . Beside that, the peak height does not de-
pends on L. Because models presenting a BKT transi-
tion have an entire critical region, the curves for U4(L)
just coincide inside that region presenting no crosses at
all. Below we present MC results for three typical re-
gions. When not indicated the error bars are smaller
than the symbol sizes.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS

A. Case D=0.1

For D = 0.1 we measured the dependence of the out-of-
plane magnetization, Mz, and the in-plane magnetization

FIG. 1: A sketch of the phase diagram for the model, (eq. 1).
Phase I correspond to an out-of-plane magnetization, phase
II has in-plane magnetization and phase III is paramagnetic.
The border line between phase I to phase II is believed to be
of ﬁrst order and from region I and II to III are both second
order.

believed to be of ﬁrst order and from region I and II to
III are both second order.

Although, the diﬀerent results agree between them-
selves about the character of the diﬀerent regions, much
care has to be taken because they were obtained by using
a cut-oﬀ, rc, in the dipolar term. The long range charac-
ter of the potential is lost, consequently we can expect a
line of BKT transition coming from region II to region
III. It is characterized by having no true long range or-
der. This lack of long range order is prevented by the
Mermin-Wagner theorem [21]. The BKT phase transi-
tion is an unusual magnetic phase transition character-
ized by the unbinding of pairs of topological excitations
named vortex-anti-vortex [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. A
vortex (Anti-vortex) is a topological excitation in which
spins on a closed path around the excitation core pre-
cess by 2π (−2π). Above TBKT the correlation length
behaves as ξ ≈ exp(bt−1/2), with t ≡ (T − TBKT )/TBKT
and ξ → ∞ below TBKT .

In this work we use MC simulations to investigate the
model deﬁned by equation 1. We use a cutoﬀ, rc, in the
dipolar interaction. Our results strongly suggest that
the transition between regions II and III is in the BKT
universality class, instead of second order, as found in
earlier works.

II. SIMULATION BACKGROUND

Our simulations are done in a square lattice of volume
L × L (L = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80) with periodic boundary
conditions. We use the Monte-Carlo method with the
Metropolis algorithm [27, 29, 30, 31]. To treat the dipole
term we use a cut-oﬀ rc = 5a, where a is the lattice

mately at T ≈ 0.70 the Mz magnetization goes to zero,
which gives a rough estimate of the critical temperature.
The in-plane magnetization has a small peak close to
T ≈ 0.70. However, the height of the peak diminishes as
L grows, in a clear indicative that it is a ﬁnite size arti-
ﬁce. The behavior of the speciﬁc heat, susceptibility and
Binder’s cumulant, are shown in ﬁgures 3, 4 and 5 respec-
tively. The results indicate a order-disorder phase tran-
sition in clear agreement with references [15, 16, 17, 19].

The growth of the number of vortices when the tempera-
ture is decreased is related to the disordering in the plane
when the magnetic moments tend to be in the z direc-
tion. We have performed a ﬁnite size scaling analysis

second order phase transition. In the phase diagram we

In this region of the parameters, it was observed a
transition from an out-of-plane ordering at low temper-
atures to an in-plane conﬁguration as described by the
magnetization behavior shown in Fig. 7. We show Mz
and Mxy in the same ﬁgure for comparison. The out-of-
plane magnetization goes to zero at T ≈ 0.35 while an
in-plane magnetization sets in. This phenomenon has al-
ready been reported experimentally [15, 16] and it is due
to the competition between the easy axis anisotropy and
the dipolar interaction. The speciﬁc heat curve presents

ﬁgure 9 we show the in-plane and out-of-plane suscepti-
bilities. The out-of-plane susceptibility presents a single
peak close to T1 ≈ 0.35. The in-plane susceptibility has
a maxima at T2 ≈ 0.65 beside the peak at T1, indicat-
ing two phase transitions. The Binder’s cumulant for
the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization are shown
in ﬁgures 10. Except for the case L = 10 the curves for
diﬀerent values of the lattice size do not cross each other
indicating a BKT transition at T ≈ T2. Beside that, the
in-plane cumulant has a minimum at T ≈ T1, which is a
characteristic of a ﬁrst order phase transition [31, 32].

The vortex density is shown in ﬁgure 11. Its behavior
is similar to that one shown in ﬁgure 6.
In the phase
diagram we crossed the region I to II (T1) and II to III
(T2). The maxima of the speciﬁc heat are shown in ﬁgure
17 as a function of L. It is clear that after a transient
behavior it remains constant indicating a BKT transi-
tion. A F SS analysis of the susceptibility (see table II
) gives the BKT temperature T ∞
BKT = 0.613(5). In the

That is an indication of a BKT phase transition.

dent on the lattice size. In addition, we did a F SS analy-
sis of the susceptibility (see table III) and the maxima of
the speciﬁc heat. The speciﬁc heat is shown in ﬁgure 17.
Its behavior indicates a BKT transition. The analysis of
the susceptibility gives T ∞
BKT = 0.709(5). In the phase
diagram we crossed the line labelled b.
In our results
we could not detect any other transition for D = 0.20,
indicating that: The line labelled a ends somewhere in
between 0.15 < D < 0.20 or the crossing at a occurs at
a lower temperature (T < 0.30) outside the range of our
simulated data.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In earlier studies several authors have claimed that the
model for ultrathin magnetic ﬁlms deﬁned by the equa-
tion 1 presents three phases. Referring to ﬁgure 1 it is
believed that the line labelled a is of ﬁrst order. The line
b and c are of second order. Those results were obtained
by introducing a cut oﬀ in the long range interaction of
the hamiltonian.
In the present work we have used a
numerical Monte Carlo approach to study the phase di-
agram of the model for J = A = 1 and D = 0.10, 0.15
and 0.20. In order to compare our results to those dis-
cussed above we have introduced a cut oﬀ in the long
range dipolar interaction. A ﬁnite size scaling analysis
of the magnetization, speciﬁc heat, susceptibilities and
Binder’s cumulant clearly indicates that the line labelled
a is of ﬁrst order and the line c is of second order in
agreement with other results. However, the b line is of

BKT type. After analysing the results obtained, some
questions come out:

1. Is it possible the existence of a limiting range of
interaction in the dipolar term beyond which the
character of the transition changes from BKT to
second order ?

2. How does the line labelled a end in the phase dia-

gram ?

3. What is the character of the intersection point of

the three lines in the phase diagram ?

the BKT involving the unbinding of vortices-anti-vortices
pairs in the model. However, to respond those questions
it is necessary to make an more detailed study of the
model for several values of the cut oﬀ range rc. In a sim-
ulation program we have to be careful in taking larger rc
values since we have to augment the lattice size propor-
tionally to prevent misinterpretations.

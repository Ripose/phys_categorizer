Abstract

Glazier and Graner’s Cellular Potts Model is a lattice-based stochastic framework
designed to simulate cell interactions and movement. The dynamics of the cells is
described by the Hamiltonian, which includes the terms representing cell adhesion
and elasticity. In this paper, we analyze the terms corresponding to the two elastic
moduli of a deformed isotropic body: the volume constraint which represents cell
compressibility, and the surface area constraint which is related to shear. We propose
to replace the surface term by a function of the dimensionless combination of the
volume and surface area of a cell. Such a modiﬁed Hamiltonian is more consistent
with classical elasticity.

Key words: Cellular Potts Model, diﬀerential cell adhesion, cell deformation,

1 Introduction

Experiment shows that embryonic cell aggregates behave like deformable solids
at short-time scales, and like viscous liquids at long-time scales [1,2]. The
viscoelastic moduli of the cytoplasm of various cells, as well as solutions of
major cytoplasmic biopolymers and various cellular components, have been
measured (see Ref. [3] and the references therein). Viscoelastic properties of
embryonic tissues can also be measured [3,4,5], and the analogy between ﬂuids
or viscoelastic solids and embryonic tissues allows us to deduce biologically
relevant information on cell adhesion [6].

Glazier and Graner’s Cellular Potts Model (CPM) provides a well-deﬁned
framework for simulations of morphogenesis [7]. It is based on Steinberg’s
diﬀerential adhesion hypothesis, according to which cells explore various con-
ﬁgurations and arrive at the one with the lowest energy [8]. The CPM gen-
eralizes the large Q-Potts model [9] to describe at the cellular level biological
mechanisms driven by surface-energy interactions between cells, such as cell
sorting [10]. Some recent applications of the CPM include studies of chicken
retinal cells [11], Dictyostelium discoideum [12], cancer invasion [13], and ﬂow-
ing foams [14,15]. The CPM successfully incorporates the viscous properties
of cells [16]. In this paper, we modify the CPM Hamiltonian that

2 The Cellular Potts Model

The CPM is a grid-based, stochastic model. N spatially distributed cells,
indexed by σ, lie on a lattice, and the value at a lattice site (pixel) (i, j, k)
is σ if this site lies in cell σ. A collection of connected lattice sites with the
same index represents a cell. The evolution of the cells follows modiﬁed Monte
Carlo-Boltzmann-Metropolis dynamics [7,10], with the cells rearranging their
positions to minimize their total free energy.

The CPM Hamiltonian includes three main terms [17,18]:

Jτ (σ(i,j,k)),τ ′(σ(i′,j′,k′))(1 − δσ(i,j,k),σ(i′,j′,k′))

H =

+

Xσ

X(i,j,k),(i′,j′,k′)
λV (τ )(V (σ) − Vt(σ))2 +

Xσ

λS(τ )(S(σ) − St(σ))2,

(1)

where τ denotes the type of a cell. The ﬁrst term describes the surface adhesion
energy between cells and between cells and their environment, and the surface
tension coeﬃcients are symmetric, Jτ,τ ′ = Jτ ′,τ . The second term corresponds
to the compressibility of the cells, V is the actual volume of a cell and Vt
is its target volume. We simulate growth of the cells by increasing their Vt.
The third term represents the elasticity of the cell membrane, S is the surface
area of a cell and St is its target surface area. In the two-dimensional CPM
we omit V and Vt, as in Ref. [7,10]). The volume constraint prevents cells
disappearance, and the surface term ﬁxes the average shape of the cells.

At each step we randomly select a lattice site (i, j, k) and change its value from
σ to the index of an arbitrary lattice site from the ﬁrst-order neighborhood
σ′, with a probability P :

P (σ(i, j, k) → σ(i′, j′, k′)) = θ(∆H)e−∆H/kT + θ(−∆H),

where ∆H is the diﬀerence in energy produced by such the change, θ is the
Heaviside step function, and T is a parameter (”temperature”) corresponding
to the amplitude of cell membrane ﬂuctuations [19]. To calculate the energy
resulting from cell-cell adhesion interactions we must consider ﬁrst and second
nearest neighbors, which reduces lattice anisotropy eﬀects compared to ﬁrst
nearest-neighbor calculations. One Monte Carlo step corresponds to one ﬂip
attempt at each lattice site.

3 The energy of an elastic deformation

The free energy per unit of volume of an elastic body in Hooke’s approximation
is given by

∂F
∂V

=

KT

(ukk)2 + µT (uij −

ukkδij)2,

where uij is the deformation tensor:

uij =

1
2 (cid:16)

∂ui
∂xj +

∂uj
,
∂xi (cid:17)

ui are the components of the deformation vector, KT is the isothermal mod-
ulus of hydrostatic compression, and µT is the isothermal modulus of rigidity
(shear) [20]. In order to obtain the total free energy of an elastic body we need
to integrate the formula (6) over the volume element, which can be taken in
Hooke’s approximation as the volume element of an undeformed body:

F =

KT

To derive the expression of an elastic body which is an aggregate of many cells,
we can regard one cell as being inﬁnitesimal and replace the above integral
with a sum over cells (denoted by σ):

F =

KT

Xσ (cid:16)

(ukk)2 + µT (uij −

ukkδij)2

Vσ.

(cid:17)σ

To obtain an expression for the internal energy of an elastic body instead
of the free energy, we just need to use the adiabatic moduli in place of the
isothermal ones,

E =

KS

In the following, we will regard the free energy of a system of cells as the CPM
Hamiltonian.

The trace of the deformation tensor ukk is simply the relative change of the
volume of a body,

Substituting the above expression into Eq. (6) and comparing with Eq. (1)
leads to the following relation:

ukk =

∆V
V

.

λV =

KT
2Vt

,

(8)

(9)

which associates the volume constraint in the CPM model with the modulus
of hydrostatic compression.

The second term in Eq. (7) does not have any explicit relation to the change
of either volume or surface. However, this term corresponds to a deformation
with no change in volume, i.e. a deformation with the change in shape only.
If we want to minimize the energy of an elastic body with an extra constraint
on its shape, then the second term in Eq. (7) must be equivalent to

λSf (g(SV −2/3) − g(StV

−2/3
t

)),

(10)

where f and g are some functions. In the above expression, λS plays a role of
a Lagrange multiplier and the dimensionless combination SV −2/3 corresponds
to a shape of a body (this relation is not one-to-one, however). Similarly, if we
have a constraint on the volume of a body, then the second term is subject to
minimization and λV is a Lagrange mutliplier.

We do not know a priori the functions f and g, although we may make any
general remarks concerning their properties. First, we notice that f should
have a global minimum at zero so the case V = Vt, S = St would be the
most favorable. Such a minium may be set to zero since the constant factors
in the Hamiltonian do not inﬂuence the dynamics. The most natural choice is
f (x) = x2 (the lowest term in the Taylor expansion). Second, g should be a
monotonous function of its argument so there would be no equally favorable
values of the quantity SV −2/3 other than the target one. The simplest choice
for g is a power function g(x) = xα.

We may establish the value of α by using a dimensional analysis in the case
of a simple unidirectional shear deformation. If the deformation vector is pro-
portional to a certain quantity h, so is the deformation tensor, and the energy

4

(11)

(12)

is proportional to h2. The change in the surface area should be proportional
to h as well. This relation leads to α = 1. The same analysis yields

λS = C

µT Vt
2

,

where C is the constant of proportionality (being on the order of 1). We may
ﬁnd the value of this constant by analyzing simple special cases. Finally, the
CPM Hamiltonian is given by

H =

K
2Vt

Xσ (cid:16)

(V − Vt)2 +

CµVt

(SV −2/3 − StV

−2/3
t

)2

.

(cid:17)σ

−2/3

−2/3

If a deformation is small and we assume that α 6= 1, then the expression
(SV −2/3)α −(StV
)α can be rewritten as (SV −2/3 −StV
)·G(V, S, Vt, St),
where G is some function that does not vanish for V = Vt and S = St. In the
linear approximation we can make the function G constant by setting V = Vt
and S = St, which reduces a case α 6= 1 to the case α = 1. Therefore, using the
S/V 2/3 ratio instead of S in the surface constraint term leads to a Hamiltonian
which is more consistent with classical elasticity. If the cells are resistant to
compression, our modiﬁed Hamiltonian should produce the same results as
the standard CPM Hamiltonian. However, if the cells can easily change their
volume, the diﬀerence between the two Hamiltonians may be signiﬁcant.

A Matrix Kato-Bloch Perturbation Method for Hamiltonian Systems

S. Moukouri
Michigan Center for Theoretical Physics and Department of Physics,
University of Michigan 2477 Randall Laboratory, Ann Arbor MI 48109

A generalized version of the Kato-Bloch perturbation expansion is presented. It consists of re-
placing simple numbers appearing in the perturbative series by matrices. This leads to the fact that
the dependence of the eigenvalues of the perturbed system on the strength of the perturbation is
not necessarily polynomial. The eﬃciency of the matrix expansion is illustrated in three cases: the
Mathieu equation, the anharmonic oscillator and weakly coupled Heisenberg chains. It is shown that
the matrix expansion converges for a suitably chosen subspace and, for weakly coupled Heisenberg
chains, it can lead to an ordered state starting from a disordered single chain. This test is usually
failed by conventional perturbative approaches.

Since its introduction long ago by Rayleigh and
Schr¨odinger, the perturbation method has become an es-
sential tool for the analysis of Hamiltonians. The pertur-
bative method consists in searching for an approximate
solution of the eigenvalue equation of a linear operator
slightly diﬀerent from an unperturbed operator whose
spectrum is known. In the perturbation expansion it is
assumed that, if the system Hamiltonian is written as
the sum of two parts H = H0 + gV , where H0 is the
unperturbed Hamiltonian and gV the perturbation, the
perturbed energies and eigenfunctions are power series of
g. The convergence of these series was studied by math-
ematicians [1], whose work may be summarized by two
important results.

−

Let A be a unitary space (i.e., a Hilbert space or more
generally a Banach space). The eigenvalues of H satisfy
the characteristic equation det(H
λ) = 0. This is an
algebraic equation of degree N equal to the dimension of
A, N = dimA. Its coeﬃcients are holomorphic functions
of g. The ﬁrst result is given by the following theorem:
the roots λ of det(H
λ) = 0 constitute one or several
branches of analytic functions of g with only algebraic
singularities. The second result is a theorem due to Rel-
lich [1], and may be stated as follows: the power series for
an eigenstate or an eigenvalue of H are convergent if the
is smaller than half
magnitude of the perturbation
of the isolation distance of the corresponding unperturbed
eigenvalue. In other terms, if an eigenvalue of H0 is iso-
lated from the rest of the spectrum then, for a suﬃciently
small g, the expansion will converge.

These results have been known for a long period of
time. But they are barely mentioned in numerous works
in condensed matter theory or in high energy theory in
which perturbation expansions are used. This is because,
in most problems, one is mainly interested in one or
two-particle properties. Hence, perturbation expansions
were formulated in terms of single or two-particle Green’s
functions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian [2]. The con-
vergence properties of Green’s function is very tedious
to analyze. One has to sum up complicated classes of
inﬁnite series of Feyman diagrams, in the so-called par-
quet summation, without a clear selection criterion. This

type of expansion generally leads to the divergence of
the dominant quantum ﬂuctuations at low temperatures.
This indicates the onset of long-range order, but, the
ordered state cannot be reached. Reaching the ordered
state may necessitate going across energy levels or a sin-
gularity. This is impossible with the conventional pertur-
bation expansion which assumes the ground-state energy
to be an analytic function of g. This has lead to the
widespread belief that the spectrum of H0 (which is sup-
posed to describe a disordered phase) is not a good start-
ing point if one wishes to reach the ordered phase. But
a clear mathematical criterion on the convergence of the
Green’s function series has never been provided. Hence,
the Green’s function method simpliﬁes the mathematics
of the problem by reducing the many-body problem to a
one- or two-body problem, but, it blurs the analysis of
eventual convergence problems.

It could thus be better to analyze the perturbative
expansions of Hamiltonians in the light of the above
two theorems by using stationary perturbation instead
of Green’s functions. However it is clear that if H0 is
the hopping Hamiltonian as used in Fermi systems, the
Rellich theorem does not apply. This is because the spec-
trum is gapless and thus any perturbation, no matter how
small, will not fullﬁl the convergence condition. That is
why it is crucial to work in a ﬁnite volume. But, even in
this case, most perturbation expansions do not converge
if the system is large for reasonable values of g.

In this letter, a simple cure for the convergence prob-
lems of perturbative expansions deﬁned in a ﬁnite vol-
ume is proposed. The starting point is the general per-
turbative expansion derived by Kato [3] and Bloch [4].
The new method consists in replacing the original Kato-
Block simple polynomial series by a matrix expansion.
In the matrix expansion, the low lying excited states
are used to shield the ground state from the rest of
the spectrum so that the near degeneracy problems that
usually plague conventional perturbation expansions are
avoided. Arguments, but not a mathematical demon-
stration, of the convergence of the matrix expansion are
given. The method is tested in some simple cases includ-
ing the Mathieu equation and the anharmonic oscillator.

Then, the new method is applied to weakly coupled an-
tiferromagnetic (AFM) chains, a problem of high current
interest in the physics of low-dimensional magnetic ma-
terials [5, 6]. It is shown that, starting from a disordered
ground state of a single chain, the new matrix pertur-
bation is able to reach the ordered state when a small
exchange interaction is turned on between the chains.

to convergence failure of the perturbative series is easy

eliminate the problem by formulating the expansion ( 1)
in terms of matrices. This can lead to convergence for a
suitable size of the matrices. The idea behind the matrix
expansion is to shield E0 from the rest of the spectrum
in the expansion (Fig. 1).
i.e., instead of restricting P0
to the eigenvalue of interest E0, one also includes a few
excited states above E0 up to the cut-oﬀ energy Enc. In
the matrix method, P0 is now given by

In the matrix expansion of ( 6), the eigenvalue of inter-

E1. The solution of the eigenproblem for ˜H0 generally
leads to a non-polynomial dependence of ˜E0 as a function
of g. For instance, the ﬁrst order corrected ground state

Let us now study a few models in order to illustrate
the diﬀerence between the matrix method and the sim-
ple polynomial expansion. It is interesting to ﬁrst study
the Mathieu equation which arises, for instance, after
separation of variables of Laplace’s equation in elliptic
cylindrical coordinates. This is because this equation was

In contrast, the
matrix perturbation method leads to good results up to
g = 16 even if a small number of states is kept in the
construction of P0. The agreement with the exact result
extends to more than the sixth digit when eight or more
states are kept. The matrix perturbation estimate can be
improved for a ﬁxed number of states by increasing the
order of the matrix series. For instance in Table II, when
a second order term is included for m = 2, the agreement
with the exact result is better. In the Mathieu equation,
the rapid convergence of the matrix method is due to
the fact that the energy separation between consecutive

The unperturbed energies are now En = 0, 1, 2,...This
model has widely been used to test diﬀerent perturbative
approaches.
It is now well established that the simple
Brillouin-Wigner series is divergent for this model. One
has to resort to special resummation procedures in order
to obtain convergence. Table III shows that a simple
ﬁrst order matrix approach can accurately reproduce the
exact result up to six digits for a modest number of states
kept. But as expected, since the energy separation is 1, a
larger m than in the Mathieu equation needs to be used
in order to achieve the same accuracy.

Let us now consider a non-trivial model, antiferromag-
netic (AF) Heisenberg chains weakly coupled by a ferro-
magnetic transverse exchange J⊥ < 0. In this problem,
H0 = Hk is an array of decoupled AF chains. When
the conventional random phase approximation (RPA) is
applied to this problem, one ﬁnds that the spin sucep-
tibility diverges at low temperatures for any small J⊥.

spond to odd and even distances respectively.

This indicates that the ground state is ordered as soon
= 0. But starting from the disordered chain, the
as J⊥ 6
ordered regime cannot be reached by RPA. It is neces-
sary to turn to special procedures such as the chain-mean
ﬁeld approach [5, 6] in which the existence of long-range
order is assumed. It will now be shown below that the
matrix Kato-Bloch method can reach the ordered regime
without assuming long-range order a priori.

The exact spectrum of a single AF chain is known from
the Bethe ansatz, but eigenfunctions are not easily acces-
sible. Thus, the density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) method [9] will be used to compute an approx-
imate spectrum ǫn,
of a single chain. A preliminary
account of the ﬁrst order of this approach [10] as well as
an extensive comparison with the Quantum Monte Carlo
method was presented elsewhere [11]. By expressing the
Hamiltonian on the basis generated by the tensor prod-
uct of the states of diﬀerent chains one obtains, up to the
second order, the eﬀective one-dimensional Hamiltonian,

when J⊥ =

indicates the presence of long-range order. The same be-
havior is observed on 32

eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld on the middle chain which leads
to a ﬁnite order parameter. This result thus justiﬁes the
assumption behind chain mean-ﬁeld theory approaches
[5, 6].

In summary, using a somewhat loose interpretation of
the Rellich theorem, a convergent matrix perturbation
approach has been proposed. This new method, which
treats both the ordered and disordered regimes in a con-
trolled way, opens new possibilities in the study of phase
transitions and strongly correlated electron in condensed-
matter systems. The new method may also be useful in
handling infrared divergences in light-front Hamiltonians
in quantum chromodynamics [12].

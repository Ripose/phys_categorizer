Abstract

The pressure-induced structural transition in fcc C60 fullerene by shock compres-
sion and rapid quenching is investigated by a semi-empirical tight-binding molecular
dynamics simulation, adopting a constant-pressure scheme and a method of the order
N electronic structure calculation. At ﬁrst, the process of the amorphization of C60 is
demonstrated. The simulated results indicated that, in the material fabricated after
the quenching, the remaining dangling bonds have a large inﬂuence on physical proper-
ties, such as, the density and the presence of the band gap at the Fermi level. We have
furthermore studied the formation of the short-range order, observed as amorphous
diamond. In order to form the amorphous diamond phase, the bonding state of sp2
must be turned into that of sp3. The transition process is seriously inﬂuenced from the
the external pressure, the temperature, or the presence of hydrogen. The comparison
to the pressure-induced structural transition in the graphite is also executed and a brief
discussion on the diﬀerence in those carbon crystals is given.

1 Introduction

In the ﬁeld of high-pressure material science, diverse carbon systems under pressure have

been intensively studied with interest in synthesizing new phases. For example, the pressure-

induced structural transition from C60 fullerene to amorphous diamond is realized by shock

compression and rapid quenching[1]. The shock compression and rapid quenching generate

the high pressure (50-55GPa) and the temperature (2000-3000K) in a fraction of a microsec-

ond. Consequently the C60 fcc crystal transforms into stable transparent glassy chips of µm

in size, which are conﬁrmed to be an amorphous phase of diamond by electron energy-loss

spectroscopy and electron diﬀractometry[1]. Though this phase has a short-range order sim-

ilar to normal diamond, it is amorphous. This amorphous phase is characterized by being

consisted mostly from sp3 bonding, in contrast with previously reported amorphous carbon

which is considered to be a disordered phase of graphite with sp2 bonds[2, 3]. By an investi-

gation of the sample after the shock compression, the fabrication process for the amorphous

diamond is postulated in the following way [1]. Once the fcc cell of C60 is compressed, the

inter-cluster bonding between C60 molecules is formed. In other words, the polymerization of

the C60 clusters occurs there, as was observed in several high-pressure experiments[4, 5, 6].

By the further compression, molecules collapse and change into the amorphous.

In the

amorphous, the bonding state of sp3 is gradually produced and it forms a short-range order

extending up to the volume of the normal diamond unit cell. This high temperature phase

is quenched and obtained as the amorphous diamond, in which a greater part of the bonding

state turns into sp3 type without the crystal growth in long range.

In fact, there is uncertainty in the understanding of the fabrication process from C60 to

amorphous diamond, since the postulation for the process is obtained by checking the various

1

phases of C60 remaining after the compression and the quenching and it is not based on

direct observation of the reaction. In order to clarify such a transition process, the aid of the

computer simulation will be needed. As for the structural transformation in carbon systems,

there are a lot of theoretical approaches, from the ﬁrst principles or semi-empirical way.

However, those studies focus on the transformation between graphite and diamond. In the

present stage, the theoretical simulation on the pressure-induced structural transformation

in C60 has not been executed suﬃciently. Therefore, the object of the present work is

set to be a theoretical understanding of the pressure-induced structural transition in C60

crystal. For this purpose, a molecular dynamics simulation is executed using a tight-binding

Hamiltonian with model parameters for carbon and hydrogen systems proposed by Winn ,

Rassinger and Hafner[7], combined with the constant pressure scheme by Wentzcovotch[8, 9].

The model parameters can reproduce the energy diﬀerence and geometries in various carbon

systems including hydrogen, such as molecules and reconstructed diamond surfaces, as well

as the bulk property of diamonds and graphites. This model parameters also give results

consistent with other ab-initio and semi-empirical calculations for liquid carbon phase. In

addition, to save computational costs, a part of calculations, involved in the crystal structure

optimization, was carried out using the density matrix method [10], what is called the order

N method.

The contents of this paper are as follows. At ﬁrst the process of the pressure-induced

amorphization of C60 will be presented. According to the simulation presented here, the

C60 fcc crystal is easily and speedily transformed into the amorphous by the compression,

going through the path postulated by the experiment as above, since the C60 structure is

constructed by bondings of distorted sp2 type and it has potentiality in the transition to sp3

2

type bondings. However, in the simulated result, the amorphous phase itself is far from the

state which should be classiﬁed as ”amorphous diamond”, especially just after the transition

from C60, since the collapsed C60 fcc crystal includes a number of dangling bonds which have

not yet turned into sp3 bondings. Therefore, the present work will furthermore pursue the

transition from sp2 to sp3 in the amorphous phase through the compression, which will grad-

ually reduce the number of the dangling bonds and drive the system towards the ”amorphous

diamond” phase of randomly packing sp3 bondings. The details of those dynamical eﬀects,

such as the dependence on the temperature and the pressure, are not necessarily clariﬁed

by the experiment alone. Finally, the present paper will give a comparison of the structural

transition in C60 to the pressure-induced graphite-diamond transition by the simulation. It

will explain the reason why C60 fcc crystal shows the transition to amorphous diamond phase

and why graphite directly turns into perfect cubic diamond.

2 The simulation scheme

In the present work, the simulations are executed in the following way.

1)The initial external pressure is set to be 0GPa and the pressure is gradually raised to

the desired value.

2) Then the simulation is executed at a stationary pressure in suﬃciently long time.

3) To simulate the process of the rapid quenching, the optimized structure at 0GPa and

0K is ﬁnally obtained, by letting down the applied pressure.

In the present stage, we do not have the detailed information on the physical quantities

in the sample through the shock-compression, such as, the variation in the pressure and the

temperature related to the propagation of shock waves. For example, the temperature is not

3

preserved and rapidly escapes from the compressed system while the pressure is kept to be

high. Thus, in some calculations, the temperature is also given as a parameter independent

of the pressure.

In the electronic structure calculation, a periodic boundary condition is

applied to the fcc unit cell containing four C60 molecules and the summation over k-space is

estimated at the Γ point alone.

3 Amorphization from the C60 fcc crystal

3.1 Compression at 0K

At ﬁrst, the C60 fcc crystal was optimized at the pressure of 50-100GPa, keeping the tem-

perature at 0K. The C60 fcc structure is stable in this pressure range. The initial cubic cell

parameter including four C60 molecules is set to be 14.15˚A. For example, a compression at

50GPa changed the cell into smaller one, in which the cell parameter shrinks to 13.6 ˚A. In

the compressed cell, the relative positions of atoms are still preserved, while the covalent

bonds are formed between C60 molecules. This is a kind of the polymerization, but not the

amorphization.

3.2 Compression at ﬁnite temperature

Obviously, the reason why the C60 crystal is stable in such a high pressure is that the

simulation is executed in an unphysical condition, i.e., keeping the temperature at 0 K. In

the experiments for fabricating the amorphous diamond, the temperature rapidly rises from

the room temperature to the range no less than 2000-3000 K. Then the collapse of the crystal

will become drastic owing to the active movements of atoms, as can be expected from the

phase diagram of carbon[11]. Therefore, in this section, the simulation is executed with the

condition that the temperature of the system can vary. To do this, the equation of motion is

4

solved in the constant pressure scheme of molecular dynamics[8] without any scaling of the

kinetic energy.

Figure 1 shows the snapshots of an example of the amorphization.

In this case, the

pressure is linearly increased from 0GPa to 65GPa in the ﬁrst 0.45ps and kept constant after

that. The temperature is set to be 300K in the beginning and spontaneously increases to

2000-3000K by compression partly because this is adiabatic compression and partly because

of recombination of C-C bonds. In the early stage, the stacking structure of the fcc crystal is

still preserved. The C60 molecules come to show deformation and polymerization, if the inter-

cluster distance becomes much closer to the intra-cluster atomic distance, as was observed in

the compression study by Duclos et al.[12]. By further compression, amorphization occurs

and it results in the destruction of the molecular structure in the whole cell. At the same

time, the sp2 bonding gradually transforms into the sp3.

The structural change in Fig.1 is also quantitatively checked. Figures 2 and 3 show the

change in the pair-distribution function and the bond-angle distribution, which correspond

to the snapshot of the transition process in Fig.1. The initial fcc C60 crystal has already

turned into the amorphous phase in the ﬁrst 1000 MD steps (1.0ps), as can be seen from

these ﬁgures. The initial bond-angle distribution has two peaks at 108 degrees and 120

degrees, which mean bond-angles in ﬁve- and six-membered rings. As the time goes by,

these two clear peaks become more and more broad and ﬁnally merge into one peak around

110 degrees. This indicates the vanishing of the molecular structure of C60.

Compressions in the pressure higher than 65GPa accompanies more temperature increase

and it turns C60 into amorphous. On the other hand, if the maximum pressures are lower than

50GPa, and if the simulation starts at the room temperature, the fcc C60 crystal does not

5

collapse completely, probably because the ﬁnal temperature(1000-2000K) is not suﬃciently

high. However, if the initial temperature is set to be suﬃciently high, as high as in the order

of 1000K, the amorphization proceeds even at about 50GPa.

4 Formation of amorphous diamond

To gain the frozen phase after the rapid-quenching, we execute the crystal structure opti-

mization ﬁrstly at the high pressure and ﬁnally obtain the optimized structure at 0GPa,

gradually letting down the pressure.

In the actual process of the shock compression and

rapid quenching, the high-temperature phase is frozen into the system owing to the rapid

decrease in the temperature, while the high pressure is still kept.

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the results of the crystal structure optimization, where the

maximum compression pressures are set to be 65GPa and 125GPa, respectively. (In both

cases, the optimized structures at 0GPa are obtained after the MD simulations continued as

long as about 10ps, so that the property of the ﬁnally fabricated material shall not seriously

be aﬀected by the ﬁniteness of the simulation time.) In these structures, the short-range

order, formed in the high temperature and the high pressure, remains almost unchanged.

The pair distribution function (not shown here) shows the peaks around 1.5˚A and 2.5˚A,

which correspond to the contributions from the ﬁrst- and next-nearest neighboring atoms,

as is seen in that of the high temperature phase. However, only from the location of the

peaks, it is diﬃcult to determine whether the short-range order comes from a diamond-like

structure or not. It may be likely that the peaks are attributed to the fragments of the C60,

since the distances from one atom to the ﬁrst- or next-nearest neighboring atoms are of the

same extent both in diamond and in a single C60 molecule. Thus the distribution of the

6

azimuthal angle, as is deﬁned in Fig.5(a), was checked. Here the azimuthal angle is deﬁned

to be the relative angle of the two planes, respectively spanned by two bonds, when these two

plane share one common bond. This distribution gives the information on the networking

structure of the tetrahedron of sp3, and it will have peaks around 60 degrees or 180 degrees

for cubic diamond and around 140 degrees for the C60 structure. (The pairs of six- and ﬁve-

membered rings in C60 form the angle of about 140 degrees.) In Fig.5(b), for the case of the

compression at 65GPa, there are no prominent peaks around 60 or 140 degrees. It means that

the cage structure of C60 vanishes, while the diamond-like short range order is not clearly

formed. On the other hand, in the structure compressed at 125GPa, there is a prominent

peak near 60 degrees in Fig.5(c). The cubic-diamond-like short-range order, extending up to

the third-nearest neighbors, is much more developed there, since this structure compressed

by the larger pressure has much more number of sp3 bonding.

In fact, the networking structure of bonds is not necessarily conﬁned to cubic diamond

phase alone, since the energy diﬀerence between cubic and hexagonal diamond phase is little

[9]. Several local bonding structures similar to that of hexagonal diamond are found in the

simulated results. In perfect hexagonal diamond structure, the azimuthal angle with respect

to a bond on an atom parallel to the c-axis takes 0 and 120 degrees. On the other hand

azimuthal angles with respect to other three bonds on an atom take 60 and 180 degrees,

which is the same as cubic diamond. Therefore, even in perfect hexagonal diamond phase,

the contributions to the distribution of azimuthal angles at 0 and 120 degrees is weak and it

is one third of those at 60 and 180 degrees. Thus contribution from hexagonal-diamond like

short range order around 0 or 120 degrees is hidden due to the randomness in amorphous.

The density in the structure compressed by the maximum pressure 65GPa [Fig.4(a)] is

7

estimated to be about 2.7 g/ cm3. On the other hand, the density is 3.5 g/ cm3 after

the compression at the maximum pressure 125GPa [Fig.4(b)], which is comparable to the

experiment. In the actual amorphous diamond, the density is estimated to be larger than

3.3 g/cm3[13].

Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the density of states of the ﬁnally fabricated material (frozen

phase) after the compression at the maximum pressure 65GPa and 125GPa. These electronic

structures are quantitatively diﬀerent from that of the initial C60 fcc crystal, which is given in

Ref.[14]. The diﬀerence between Fig.6(a) and 6(b) results from the number of dangling bonds.

In these ﬁgures, the contribution to the DOS from threefold carbon atoms is compared to the

total DOS. Owing to the contribution from dangling bonds, the gap between the conduction

and valence bands vanishes. In case of the compression at 65GPa[Fig.6(a)], the ratio of atoms

with dangling bond amounts to 50 %, while in case of the compression at 125GPa[Fig.6(b)],

the ratio of such atoms deceases to about 10%. Therefore, in the latter case, the conduction

and valence bands are distinguished by a reduction of the DOS near the Fermi level, which

is featured as a shaded zone in the ﬁgure. This reduction in the DOS is interpreted to be

an analogous of the wide gap in the perfect diamond structure. In Fig.6(a), a narrow gap

at the Fermi level is formed in the dangling bond states and it separates the occupied and

unoccupied states. This is because the presence of a gap, even if it is narrow, makes the

system more stable.

Comparing the results corresponding to the compression at 65GPa and 125GPa, the

latter case, compressed at the larger pressure, is considered to be a better simulation, since

the actual amorphous diamond has a transparent optical property similar to the normal

diamond and it will have an electronic structure with a large gap near the Fermi level. In

8

our simulations, at the pressure above 100GPa and the temperature above 5000K, the ratio

of threefold carbon atoms decreases to 10−20%, and the valence and conduction bands tend

to be distinguished by a wide range reduction in the DOS near the Fermi level, owing to the

decrease of the dangling bonds. In the experimentally obtained amorphous diamond, the

number of the the dangling bonds will also be reduced, possibly more than in this simulation.

(It is certain that the dangling bonds still remain in the actual amorphous diamond, as was

indicated by the EELS spectrum in Ref.[1].)

5 An analysis for the dynamical process in the transi-

tion

After the rapid amorphous transition, it takes a long time until the short range order is

formed again. In this section, the dynamical process in the reaction, especially related to the

pressure and the temperature, is investigated. Figure 7 shows the results by a simulation

where the external pressure is increased from 0GPa to 65GPa, and after that, the pressure is

furthermore increased to 125 GPa, in order to check the pressure dependence. Figures 7(a)-

(d) show the time dependence of the external pressure, the temperature, the mean square

of the displacement, and the ratio of carbon atoms with fourfold coordination. The increase

in the ratio of carbon atoms with fourfold coordination stands for the transition from sp2

to sp3, and it reﬂects on the reconstruction of the short-range order.

In the amorphous

phase, sp2-type bonding is gradually transformed into sp3-type, while the transition speed,

in other word, the speed of the short-range order formation is going down. However, at least

in the order of the picoseconds, the system has not yet arrive at the stationary state. The

ﬁgure furthermore shows the dependence of the reaction on the external pressure. When the

9

external pressure is raised again, the number of the sp3 bonding grows much more, since the

transition is accelerated by the higher temperature and the higher density. The density in

the high temperature phase amounts to about 3.0g/cm3 at 65GPa and increases to about

3.5g/cm3 at 125GPa.

The simulated result supports the postulations for the amorphous diamond formation

process from the experimental data[1]. We should stress here the importance of the following

phenomena. Since the high temperature is generated through the reconstruction of the

bonding, the reaction is enhanced so that the system can cross the potential barrier and

transform its structure. (The system obtains work by the compression and the temperature

increases to some extent, but it is not enough to speed up the reaction furthermore.) As

an example, ﬁgure 8 shows the results of the two simulation where the external pressure is

increased to 125GPa. In the ﬁrst case, denoted as (A), there is no restriction to the variation

of the temperature. On the other hand , in the second case, denoted as (B), the temperature

is set to be 2500K after 0.5ps. The transition from sp2 to sp3 is apparently hindered in the

case of (B), since the movement of atoms is inactive because of the lower temperature, in

contrast with the case (A). For the same reason, the compression at 0K, shown in the previous

section, cannot turn C60 to the amorphous. These simulations also suggest that there are

possibly innumerable quasi-stable conﬁgurations by which the system is easily trapped. The

amorphous diamond phase can also be regarded as one of such quasi-stable transient phases

located in the reaction path from C60 to the bonding state of sp3 in whole crystal, i.e. perfect

diamond phase. (In fact, the shock compression applied to lower-grade C60 [15] exhibited the

entire transition to the diamond crystallite, probably because of the easier crystal growth in

the presence of defects and impurities.) Since shock compression process continues as long as

10

nanoseconds, it is possible that the actual amorphous diamond phase has a structure much

closer to perfect diamond, compared to the present simulation whose time-scale is at most

picoseconds order. In the actual shock compression, a large ﬂuctuation in the pressure and

the temperature through the shock-wave propagation will fabricate variously altered phases,

as are classiﬁed in several states[1], ranging from the slightly compressed fcc structure to the

amorphous diamond.

It appears that the speed of increasing pressure may have some inﬂuence on the reaction.

For example, if the response of the crystal inner stress cannot catch up with the rapid

increase of the pressure, the decaying process of the crystal will become more drastic. The

response of the inner stress is related to the cell deformation and it is dependent on the

ﬁctitious mass assigned to the cell deformation, as well as the external pressure and the

inner stress in the constant-pressure scheme. We would like to avoid such dependence of

the simulation on the artiﬁcial degree of freedom as possible. For this purpose, we adjusted

the ﬁctitious mass heavy enough so that the ﬂuctuation of the ”kinetic energy” assigned

to the cell deformation is kept to be very small and the almost ”isenthalpic” simulation

becomes possible at a stationary pressure. The speed of raising the applied pressure is set

to be suﬃciently slow in such a way that the inner stress shall rise parallel with the external

pressure. By doing so, the system property is almost determined by the the current pressure,

and scarcely dependent on the kinetic contribution from the cell deformation. For example,

in ﬁgure 7 and 8, where the pressure is raised to 125GPa in two diﬀerent ways, the ﬁnal

system properties, such as the temperature and the bonding order, are similar.

11

6 Discussions

In the electronic structure of the ﬁnally fabricated material after the compression, the con-

tribution from dangling bonds is not negligible. If the contribution of this kind appearing

between the valence and conduction band is large, the fabricated material will lose the trans-

parent optical property and it will not be qualiﬁed to be called amorphous diamond. As we

have seen, the contribution from dangling bonds will be reduced after the compression at

suﬃciently higher temperature and pressure. In fact, there may be other mechanism that

will reduce the contribution from dangling bonds. For example, it is well-known that the

presence of hydrogen atoms reduces the number of dangling bonds in case of amorphous

silicon. The DOS after the shock-compression in presence of hydrogen atoms are given in

Fig.9[16]. A comparison between Fig.9(a) and Fig.6(a), which are the DOS after the com-

pression at 55GPa and 65GPa, shows that the DOS is apparently reduced around the Fermi

level in the presence of the hydrogen, even if the pressure is somewhat lower. However, there

is no clear gap between the valence and conduction band in Fig.9(a). Such a situation is not

improved so much at higher pressure, as in Fig.9(b). In addition, according to the simulation

like this, even in the case when much more numbers of the hydrogen atoms are included,

dangling bonds not terminated by hydrogens are still left. This will be because the reactivity

and the mobility of bonds are weakened by the presence of many hydrogen atoms and the

formation of the short range order of sp3 will rather be hindered.

In case of the compression of C60, there are number of quasi-stable conﬁgurations in

amorphous phase, and such a transient phase will easily be frozen by the quenching. This

will be the major diﬀerence to the pressure-induced structural transition from graphite to

diamond. Figure 10 shows the transition of the bonding state from sp2 to sp3 in the com-

12

pression of the graphite.

In the ﬁgure, the rapid increase in the ratio of fourfold carbon

atoms after 1000fs stands for the transition from graphite to diamond. The transition speed

is far faster than the cooling speed of the temperature in the shock compression experiment

which is estimated to be from 106 to 1010 K/s[17]. Graphite and diamond phases are located

in very close conﬁgurations in the potential surface and there is no stable transient state in

the transition path from graphite to diamond. Since graphite rapidly transforms into the

cubic diamond without being trapped by any quasi-stable structure , perfect diamond phase

remains alone after the quenching and amorphous diamond phase will not be obtained[18].

It should be noted here that, in comparison with ab-initio theory, there are less accuracy

and less transferability in the tight-binding models, in spite of the fact that the model

parameters succeed in reproducing the bulk property of certain carbon crystals. This is

because the tight-binding model parameters are obtained by the ﬁtting to the ab-initio

results for several crystal structures. In order to check the model parameter dependence of

our simulation, we have executed additional calculations using another model parameter by

Xu et al. [19] and compared the results to those given in the previous sections. According to

the results obtained by the Xu’s parameters, if the initial condition and the applied pressure

are the same, the electronic and structural properties, such as the transition rate from sp2

to sp3 and the increase in the temperature, are of the same extent, compared to those given

in the previous sections. For example, when the compression is executed above 100GPa, the

ratio of atoms with dangling bond decreases to 10 − 20 % and the DOS shows the reduction

near the Fermi level, as well as the result in the previous section.

It should also be mentioned that the model Hamiltonian used here does not include

van der Waals interactions and is not quantitatively suﬃcient for the initial C60 fcc structure

13

formed by van der Waals force. However, the purpose of the present work is the investigation

in a compressed carbon system. Since the van der Waals force is much weaker than covalent

bonds between atoms, it will be negligible in the simulation, especially after the transition

into the high-density amorphous. In other words, the model parameters adopted here will

be a good, even if not the best, description for the physical process of the pressure-induced

structural transition from the C60 fcc crystal into the amorphous diamond.

7 Conclusion

We have investigated the amorphization of C60 fcc and the formation of amorphous diamond

phase. The electronic property of amorphized phase of C60 just after the transition is far

from so-called amorphous diamond, since the amorphized C60 contains a number of dangling

bonds which have not yet turned into sp3 type bonding. Amorphous diamond phase is

being gradually formed through the change in the bonding structure from sp2 to sp3 under

high pressure and high temperature. If dangling bonds are suﬃciently reduced, the valence

and conduction bands are distinguished and a transparent optical property is observed in

amorphous diamond phase as well as perfect cubic diamond. Amorphous phase is interpreted

as one of quasi-stable phases in the transition path from C60 to diamond phase under pressure.

If the temperature and the pressure are not suﬃciently high, the reaction will be interrupted

before forming amorphous diamond phase, probably because there are many quasi-stable

phases between C60 and diamond and the system is liable to be trapped by such phases.

This is in contrast with pressure-induced graphite-diamond transition. Since graphite and

diamond phase are located in very near conﬁgurations in the potential surface, the transition

from graphite to diamond proceeds rapidly without passing through any stable transient

14

phase. From this reason, the formation of amorphous diamond phase is characteristic in the

compression of C60 and such a phase is not obtained in the compression of graphite.

[16] In the compression with the presence of hydrogen, the temperature grows more than

that does in the case without hydrogen, since the combination energy between C and H

is released together with that between C and C. However the transition speed itself is

not raised so large.

[17] H.Hirai and K.Kondo, Science 253,772(1991).

[18] Even in the pressure-temperature range where the C60 turns into the amorphous, the

graphite is stable, while being somewhat compressed along c-axis. The simulation, how-

ever, shows that the compression at a suﬃciently high pressure and a high temperature

distorts the graphite sheets and causes the ﬂuctuation where the weak inter-layer bridg-

ing is being formed. If such a ﬂuctuation can grow large enough, the global transition to

the diamond will start. This accounts for the time-lag between the raise of the pressure

and that of the ratio of sp3[Fig.10]. Such inter-layer bridging in the ﬂuctuation easily

vanishes and does not remain after the decrease in the pressure and the temperature.

• Figure 1: Snapshots of the transition from C60 fcc crystal to amorphous are given. The
pressure is increased from 0GPa to 65GPa in 0.45ps and kept to be 65GPa after that.
The pictures show the system cut out into a 15 × 15 × 15˚A3 cube, which does not stand

• Figure 7: An example of the dynamical eﬀect caused by changes in the pressure through
the compression is given here. Pressure is raised from 0GPa to 65GPa, and after that,
again raised to 125GPa. The early stage of this simulation, where the pressure is
conﬁned in the range from 0GPa to 65GPa, corresponds to the snapshot given in ﬁgure
1. These ﬁgures show the very slow reconstruction process of the short-range order in
the amorphous at the high pressure and temperature.

In the path, denoted as (A), there is no concentration on the temperature. In the path
(B), the temperature is scaled at 2500K after 0.5ps.

• Figure 8(b):The variation in the temperature.
• Figure 8(c):The mean square of the displacement. In the path (B), owing to the lower

temperature, the atomic movement becomes more inactive.

• Figure 8(d):The ratio of fourfold carbon atoms. In the path (B), owing to the lower

temperature, the transition speed from sp2 to sp3 decreases.

• Figure 9: The density of states with the presence of hydrogen. The solid line shows the
total DOS, and the dotted line shows the contribution from threefold carbon atoms.
The cell includes hydrogen atoms at 12.5% in number. Figure 9(a) shows the DOS after
the compression at the maximum pressure 55GPa. The contribution from threefold C
atoms is about 40% in the total DOS. Figure 9(b) shows the DOS after the compression
at the maximum pressure 125GPa. The contribution from threefold C atoms is about
20% in the total DOS.

• Figure 10: This ﬁgure shows the ratio of fourfold carbon atoms in the pressure-induced
structural transition from graphite to cubic diamond. The transition from sp2 to sp3 in
the whole crystal can bee seen in the rapid increase in that ratio, changing from 0 to 1.
In this simulation, the unit cell includes 240 carbon atoms. The pressure is raised from
0GPa to 150GPa in initial 0.15ps and kept constant. The temperature is scaled to be
5000K throughout the simulation. The graphite directly turns into the stable perfect
cubic diamond, taking a reaction path similar to that demonstrated in a ﬁrst principles
simulation[9].

Figure 9: The density of states with the presene of hydrogen. The solid line shows

the total DOS, and the dotted line shows the ontribution from threefold arbon

atoms. The ell inludes hydrogen atoms at 12.5% in number. Figure 9(a) shows

the DOS after the ompression at the maximum pressure 55GPa. The ontribution

from threefold C atoms is about 40% in the total DOS. Figure 9(b) shows the DOS

after the ompression at the maximum pressure 125GPa. The ontribution from

threefold C atoms is about 20% in the total DOS.

Figure 10: This (cid:12)gure shows the ratio of fourfold arbon atoms in the pressure-

indued strutural transition from graphite to ubi diamond. The transition from

sp

to sp

in the whole rystal an bee seen in the rapid inrease in that ratio,

hanging from 0 to 1. In this simulation, the unit ell inludes 240 arbon atoms.

The pressure is raised from 0Pa to 150GPa in initial 0.15ps and kept onstant. The

temperature is saled to be 5000K throughout the simulation. The graphite diretly

turns into the stable perfet ubi diamond, taking a reation path similar to that

demonstrated in a (cid:12)rst priniples simulation[9℄.

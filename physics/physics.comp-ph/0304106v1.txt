The dynamics of an electronic Dirac wave packet evolving under the inﬂuence of an ultra-intense
laser pulse and an ensemble of highly charged ions is investigated numerically. Special emphasis is
placed on the evolution of quantum signatures from single to multiple scattering events. We quantify
the occurrence of quantum relativistic interference fringes in various situations and stress their
signiﬁcance in multiple-particle systems, even in the relativistic range of laser-matter interaction.

PACS numbers: 34.80.-i, 34.80.Qb

The interplay of the strongest forces in atomic physics
via ultra intense laser pulses and highly charged ions is
governed rather well by quantum relativistic Dirac dy-
namics [1, 2, 3]. On one hand, for single particles quan-
tum eﬀects such as tunneling, spin eﬀects and quantum
interferences have shown to be rather crucial even in
the regime of ultra-short and highly relativistic dynam-
ics [4, 5]. On the other hand, for many particle systems,
laser-induced plasma physics was shown to be remarkably
well described by classical relativistic dynamics [6, 7].
With the intermediate regime from few particle to clus-
ter physics attracting increasing interest [8], the question
arises for the role of quantum eﬀects in laser-induced rel-
ativistic dynamics.

In this letter we investigate the quantum relativistic
dynamics of laser-driven multiple-scatterings of an elec-
tron being represented by a Volkov wave packet at an
ensemble of highly charged ions. With an numerical ac-
curacy, which allows for transitions even to the Dirac
sea with negative energies, we quantify the interference
fringes at each scattering event and the mutual interplay
among those events. Clear quantum behaviour in the
Dirac wave packet is identiﬁed in the highly relativistic
regime after multiple scattering.

The system of interest consists of an electron which is
driven by an intense laser pulse with time t and space ~r
dependent vector potential ~A(t, ~r ) and scattered multi-
ply at an ensemble of ions with scalar potential A0(~r ).
The electronic wave packet dynamics in such an environ-
ment is characterised by the Dirac spinor ψ(t, ~r ) and is
governed by the Dirac equation reading in atomic units

respectively, and c = 137.036 a.u. the speed of light.

Our numerical analysis takes advantage of splitting
the linear Dirac Hamiltonian into a position-dependent
and a derivative-dependent part. We then make use of
the so-called “split-operator” technique [10], in which we
propagate the wave packet successively by the position-
and derivative-dependent parts and employ fast-Fourier-
transformations, such that all operations are plain multi-
plications. With time step ∆t, the numerical error intro-
duced this way is of the order ∆t3 [10]. For ∆t ≈ 2×10−5
a.u.< ~
2mc2 , transitions between positive- and negative-
energy states are resolved, and this way we obtained con-
vergence of our split-step propagation of ψ even at large
t & 10 a.u.. Further the spacing of the grid in position
space needs to be suitable to resolve the maximal mo-
menta employed. In spite of large relativistic velocities,
this is not problematic, because it is the canonical rather
than the kinetic momentum that has to be represented
~A = ~pkin. In the case of a high
on the grid, with ~pcan − q
c
velocity of the particle being exclusively due to an intense
laser ﬁeld, ~pcan is even zero in polarization direction. It
is non-zero in propagation direction, but its magnitude is
small even for intense ﬁelds. Once scatterings with nuclei
have occurred, however high canonical momenta appear,
which, for the parameters used here, can be represented
successfully on a grid with a spacing ∆xi = 0.118 a.u.,
corresponding to a maximum momentum of 26.6 a.u..
The so-called fermion doubling problem, which occurs at
momenta close to the highest grid momenta, is conse-
quently also avoided [11].

For the sake of reducing computing power, we intro-
duced two advantageous techniques. Firstly,
in posi-
tion space, the calculation is restricted to the area cen-
tered around the rapidly moving wave packet, involving
a “moving-grid” approach. Secondly, the grid size, too,
is dynamically adapted in time: While a freely evolving
wave packet spreads with time, a multiply scattered one
does considerably more. As our simulation has to cover a
substantial part of the whole laser pulse, including times
where the packet is still quite small, it is possible to save
considerable CPU time, noting that the time consum-
ing two-dimensional fast-Fourier-transformations scale as
O(N 2 log N ), where N × N equals the grid size. This

FIG. 1: a) Overview: Contour plots at t = 7.645, 8.195, 9.495, 12.095 a.u. corresponding to times before the ﬁrst scattering,
shortly after it, at the lower point of return, and after the second scattering, close to the upper point of return. The four
dashed rectangles (some only partly visible) mark the dynamical grid boundaries for each of these situations. The thick dots
indicate the positions of two Sn50+ ions, which are located right on the horizontal axis at positions 16.5 and 30.0 a.u. The
solid line depicts the trajectory of the expectation value of the particle’s spatial coordinate. We omit any enlarged view of the
initially Gaussian packet at t = 7.645, but provide them for the other three cases as follows: b) Enlarged view at t = 8.195 a.u.
showing single scattering fringes shortly after the scattering event; c) Enlarged view at t = 9.495 a.u. that depicts the same
single scattering fringes somewhat later in order to illustrate the growth of the distance between any two fringes (compare with
b)); d) Enlarged view at t = 12.095 a.u. which displays interference from two separate scattering events with crossed fringes
on the left side and the unperturbed structure from single scattering at the ﬁrst ion only on the right side. In all cases contour
lines are shown for |ψ|2 with log |ψ|2 ≥ −4 and line spacings marking steps of 0.15.

“growing-grid” approach is also our pragmatic solution
to the well-known boundary problem [3, 12] in Dirac cal-
culations, at least to the point where damping functions
and absorbing boundaries become unavoidable. Finally,
the whole code is written to take advantage of multiple
CPUs.

In a series of contour plots, we present the time evo-
lution of an initially Gaussian shaped wave packet un-
der the inﬂuence of a strong laser pulse, which is sub-
sequently scattered at several highly charged ions. We
use a four cycle laser pulse with amplitude E0 = 50 a.u.
(I = 8.75 × 1019 W
cm2 ) and frequency ω = 1 a.u., which
features a 1.5 cycles sin2 turn-on and turn-oﬀ, and one

cycle of constant intensity in between. As amplitude and
frequency suggest, we are clearly in the fully relativis-
tic regime. The ions are modeled by static softcore po-
tentials Ze2/
((~r − ~rIon)2 + a), with a “Coulomb-like”
small softcore parameter a = 0.01 being just large enough
to avoid numerical instabilities at the ions’ origins ~rIon.
We chose their charge as a high multiple (Z = 50) of the
elementary charge e in order to acquire comparable ﬁeld
strengths for laser and ions (at 1 a.u. distance from the
ionic center).

In ﬁg. 1, the top left graph illustrates an overview of
the successive quantum relativistic scattering scenario of
an electron wave packet at two highly charged ions. The

initial Gaussian wave packet (positive energy and spin up
only) is centered around the origin and its evolution is de-
picted by various snap shots along its center of mass mo-
tion (solid line) in the laser pulse. At ﬁrst, after a short
motion in the negative polarization and positive propa-
gation directions during the ﬁrst half cycle of the turn-on
phase, the particle is visibly accelerated in the polariza-
tion direction, reaching the ﬁrst upper turning point after
the ﬁrst whole cycle is completed. Further on, continuing
with a clear Lorentz-force induced drift in the laser prop-
agation direction, the electron wave packet is accelerated
in the negative polarization direction to face its ﬁrst en-
counter with an ionic core potential. The motion that
we observe during the ﬁrst unperturbed 1 1
4 cycles could
be modeled rather accurately and easily with a classical
Monte Carlo ensemble and is completely in agreement
with known free (without nucleus) quantum wave packet
results in [13]. This includes the Lorentz-contraction of
the wave packet along the direction of present velocity
and its apparent rotation, i.e. precisely shearing, be-
cause of the phase diﬀerences sensed by spatially sepa-
rated parts of the wave packet.

At the ﬁrst encounter of the electron wave packet with
the nuclei at position (16.5, 0), the laser electric ﬁeld is
rather small at this particular phase. Therefore relativis-
tic Coulomb scattering dominates, involving the interfer-
ence of the incoming wave with the scattered wave. The
corresponding fringe structure which features a distinct
maximum in forward direction followed by a series of side
maxima, can be viewed in detail in ﬁg. 1b. Further
fringes from a scattering at the second ion at (30, 0) are
also visible. With increasing time the wave packet evolves
in the negative polarization direction towards the second
lower turning point, which is reached after 1.5 cycles.
The separations among the fringes have grown substan-
tially which themselves turn continuously more parallel,
with an orientation reﬂecting the direction of motion at
the time when the scattering occurred (ﬁg. 1c).

Finally, the wave packet, which at this stage is split
in various sub-wave packets, continues in positive polar-
ization direction. The fringes maintain their orientation
when the second scattering at the second ion occurs, and
are therefore joined by a set of newly created fringes with
a diﬀerent orientation. When two cycles are completed,
the electron has reached its second upper turning point.
Fig. 1d is a snapshot taken a little while before that, and
one can clearly see the pattern that is generated by two
sets of diﬀerently oriented interference fringes. ¿From
then on, without further scatterings, the whole structure
essentially remains, apart from further changes imposed
by the laser ﬁeld such as spreading and shearing with an
essentially classical center-of-mass motion.

In ﬁgure 2, we show in a similar way the eﬀect on the
same initially Gaussian wave packet after it has passed a
collection of seven ions two times. A classical estimation
conﬁrms that such a collection of heavy highly charged
ions moves less than 0.04 a.u. due to Coulomb repulsion
and the laser ﬁeld during maximally employed interaction

time of ∆t ≈ 12 a.u. and may thus be assumed as resting.
We note that the clear interference structures in single
and double scattering are now less apparent though still
visible when one moves to complex structures.

A simple analytical model is ﬁnally introduced to qual-
itatively conﬁrm our numerical result. Adopting existing
text-book [14] theory for three-dimensional Dirac scat-
tering of an electron ψ at the time-independent potential
of an ion at ~rIon = ~0, we obtain

We are interested in the maxima of |ψ|2 = ψ†ψ, or more
exactly in the angles ϑn that point towards the scattering
fringes. Using V (~r ′) = −V0δ(~r ′) [15] with V0 > 0 as the
simplest potential, we ﬁnally obtain, up to an additive
function f (r) and a constant pre-factor, the ϑ-dependant
part of |ψ|2 as

|ψ|2 ∝ ((γ2 − 1) cos ϑ + 1 + γ2) cos (kr − kr cos ϑ) + f (r).

Then to adapt the dynamics in the laser ﬁelds, one
may choose for a ﬁxed initial momentum ~k a distance

fringes would be observed and calculate the correspond-
ing angles ϑn. Then with the laser ﬁeld and, using a clas-
sical formula [16] and now neglecting the ionic potentials,

of magnitude ~k in the direction of the scattering angles
ϑn. This simple model qualitatively conﬁrms our numer-
ical results while it fails to predict the ﬁnal positions and
separations of the fringes by better than a factor of two.
In addition to the stressed approximations in the analyti-
cal approach, the mimicking of the quantum wave packet
in the transition regime from scattering to free dynamics
in the laser ﬁeld is too delicate to compete seriously in ac-
curacy with the up-initio quantum relativistic approach.

Concluding, relativistic quantum dynamics was inves-
tigated for a multiple-particle system with clear interfer-
ence fringes being identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. While quan-
tum signatures in many-particle systems are likely to be
washed out, our examples show that there is an inter-
mediate regime in the number of involved particles with
clear quantum eﬀects for relativistic dynamics.

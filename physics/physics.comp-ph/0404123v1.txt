Abstract

−

For the N

plets of bound states in a quasi-exactly solvable (QES) toy model (sextic

oscillator), the spectrum is known to be given as eigenvalues of an N by N matrix.

Its determination becomes purely numerical for all the larger N > N0 = 9. We

propose a new perturbative alternative to this construction. It is based on the fact

that at any N, the problem turns solvable in the limit of very large angular momenta

ℓ

→ ∞

. For all the ﬁnite ℓ we are then able to deﬁne the QES spectrum by convergent

perturbation series. These series admit a very speciﬁc rational resummation, having

an analytic or branched continued-fraction form at the smallest N = 4 and 5 or N = 6

and 7, respectively. It is remarkable that among all the asymptotically equivalent

small expansion parameters µ

1/(ℓ + β), one must choose an optimal one, with

∼

unique shift β = β(N).

ﬁnds its applications as an approximate model in nuclear physics [1] as well as in

quantum chemistry [2] and atomic physics [3]. Last but not least, it is encountered

as a popular exercise in textbooks on quantum mechanics [4]. In all these cases, the

main mathematical merit of the model (1) lies in its separability, i.e., reducibility to

the set of the ordinary (so called radial) diﬀerential equations

They are all easily solvable by any standard numerical technique [5].

Whenever we need a non-numerical solution, we must restrict the class of our

potentials V (

) to a subset which is exactly solvable (ES, say, harmonic-oscillator)

~r
|

|

or at least quasi-exactly solvable (QES, see, e.g., the monograph [6] for a thorough

review). Of course, the real appeal of any ES or QES potential derives from an

agreement of its shape or spectrum with some “more realistic” numerical model

V [phys](

~r
|

|

). In this sense, many practical applications of the ES subset are marred

by its comparatively small size and, hence, by a very narrow variability of the avail-

able shapes of V [ES](

) (cf., e.g., ref.

[7] for their representative list). In parallel,

the wealth of the forms of the multi-parametric wells V [QES](

) may happen to be

~r
|

|

~r
|

|

more than compensated by the much more complicated tractability of their pertur-

bations [8]. Moreover, even the very zero-order QES constructions may become quite

complicated, whenever the size N of the required QES multiplet leaves the domain

of N

N0 where the practical determination of the spectrum remains non-numerical

≤

[9]. Although the latter remark sounds like a paradox, one must keep in mind that

even in the simplest QES models, the explicit construction of the larger QES mul-

tiplets with N > N0 requires the more or less purely numerical diagonalization of

asymmetric N by N matrices (see below). In purely pragmatic terms, many closed

1

QES constructions [10, 11] are in fact more diﬃcult than an immediate numerical

solution of the diﬀerential Schr¨odinger eq. (1) itself.

In what follows we shall argue that it is possible to avoid the latter brute-force

methods even in the QES domain where N > N0. We shall recommend the use

of the so called large

ℓ (or large

D [12]) expansion philosophy [13] in its new im-

−

−

plementation which takes into account several speciﬁc features of QES models. We

shall reduce all the inessential technicalities to a necessary minimum and restrict our

attention just to one of the most elementary illustrative QES examples

(2)

which is known to possess an elementary N

plet of QES solutions at any N [14].

On the background of this example we shall start our considerations in section 2 by

showing that due to the absence of the quartic term in eq. (2), the QES solvability

conditions are transparent and instructive (cf. subsection 2.1). In subsection 2.2 we

show how these conditions simplify even the standard large

ℓ perturbation expan-

sions of the spectrum where one uses just an asymptotic, ℓ

1 simpliﬁcation of the

diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equation (1). In section 2.3 we add that in the more speciﬁc,

QES-related setting, the algebraic construction of the solutions might be preferrable,

−

≫

at least due to its amazingly transparent form.

The latter expectations are more than conﬁrmed in the subsequent section 3.

After a step-by-step analysis of the QES secular equations for the energies in depen-

dence on the growing dimension N, we are able to reveal their general polynomial

structure and perturbation form. The ﬁrst subsection 3.1 shows that the models

with N

3 are all fully solvable via an elementary re-scaling of the matrix secular

≤

equation. Formally, our presently conjectured “optimally shifted” large

ℓ series re-

main trivial in this case. The zero-order result is exact and its secular polynomial

−

does not contain any perturbation. All the higher-order corrections simply vanish.

Still, the structure of the N = 3 secular equation is already rich enough to illustrate,

why the “optimal” value of the shift of ℓ

1 is so exceptional, and how a return to

≫
its “non-optimal” values would re-introduce non-vanishing perturbation corrections.

2

In subsection 3.2, some of these observations are re-conﬁrmed at N = 4. Ele-

mentary analysis oﬀers the explanation why our “optimally shifted” large

ℓ power

−

series are convergent. The determination of the explicit value of the radius of conver-

gence µmax reveals that the circle of convergence covers the whole domain of physical

interest, i.e., formally, all the positive spatial dimensions D > 0.

Subsection 3.3 uses the slightly modiﬁed N = 5 example and shows that a Pad´e-

like re-summation of our power series exists. The “re-summed” energies E (as well

as their squares Ω = E2) acquire an analytic continued-fraction form.

In subsection 3.4, the “ﬁrst nontrivial” example is shown to emerge at N = 6.

We sample there the energies in their “generalized” or “branched” continued-fraction

form as well as in their more standard power-series representation. A few questions

concerning their convergence are clariﬁed.

In subsection 3.5, an extrapolation of all the preceding constructions to any size N

of the QES multiplets is described and discussed. For quadruplets of N = 4K, 4K +

1, 4k+2 and 4K +3, our main result is formulated as an iterative K

term formula for

−

the systematic construction of the energies in a generalized continued-fraction form.

Simultaneously, the Taylor-expansion technique is shown to generate the standard

power series with the “optimally shifted” large

ℓ perturbation structure. The last

illustrations are added showing the smoothness of transition from the “last solvable”

−

N

N0 = 9 to “the ﬁrst unsolvable” N = 10.

≤
In section 4 a thorough re-interpretation of our optimally shifted large

ℓ per-

−

turbation series is given in the more standard language of the textbook Rayleigh-

Schr¨odinger perturbation theory. Once more we summarize our approach in the

last section 5, as a source of new types of perturbation expansions tailored for the

computation of the QES spectra at any multiplet size N.

The latter condition increases a phenomenological appeal of our example by assigning

to potential (2) the manifestly non-perturbative double-well shape. Many compu-

tational diﬃculties of “realistic” calculations may be mimicked, even within such a

framework, whenever one chooses a larger degree N in wave function (3). Integer

N measures the “dimension” of our problem since, under the constraint (4) and af-

ter the insertion of (3), our diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equation (1) is transformed into

equivalent matrix problem

so that up to the ﬁrst few lowest dimensions N, equation (5) need not be easy to

seem to disappear in the domain of the larger N

“remember” and share some features of the completely solvable harmonic oscillator.

In this sense, our oversimpliﬁed toy example may serve as a guide towards a future

better understanding of the partially solvable Schr¨odinger equations with more free

parameters [11].

Partially, our present paper has been motivated by all the realistic models (1) where

the dimension D is large enough [like, e.g., in ref.

[1] where D =

preceding subsection we also saw that there might exist correlations between the

O

changes of D (or ℓ) and of the conditions of (quasi-) exact solvability. Let us now

pay more attention to this phenomenon which appeared as a source of inspiration

in several studies of QES problems [16] where it has been noticed that, at a ﬁxed

matrix dimension N, the solutions are getting simpler whenever the spatial dimension

D grows to inﬁnity.

In an introductory step we imagine that the QES constraint (4) merely replaces

the deﬁnition (6) of the lower diagonal in eqs.

3 Perturbation expansions in µ2

3.1 Optimal shift: matrix dimension N = 3

In our notation where the spatial dimension D and all the angular momenta ℓ =

(D

3)/2 + m with m = 0, 1, . . . are “very” large, D

1, the integer N denotes

−

≫

just the matrix dimension in eq. (5) and its numerical value may be arbitrary. Thus,

our perturbation expansions will use the smallness of µ = 1/G or, in a more general
setting, of µ′ = 1/[D + 2m + δ(N)] where we have a full freedom in the choice of an

N

dependent shift δ = δ(N).

Let us select δ(N) = 1 + ε at N = 3, and reduce the diagonalization of our

“Hamiltonian” (12) to the elementary secular equation

Although its explicit polynomial form E3

choose the above shift δ with the special and unique ε = 0. After this “optimal”
choice, all the three zero-order energy roots Ej ∈ {−

remain safely real and

four series have, obviously, the same and non-vanishing circle of convergence with the

we may conclude that for all our four shifted-large

ℓ perturbation series at N = 4,

the circle of convergence is amply suﬃcient to cover the whole domain of physical

interest.

The overall square-root form of the “energies” E might have been taken into

account in this context. At least, one may expect a simpliﬁcation of the formulae

when the squares of the energies Ω = E2 are taken into consideration. For example,

in place of the latter two series (15), the “uniﬁed” power-series formula reads

Ω(µ2) = E2

Its use improves the rate of convergence because we removed one of the branch

points, arriving at the new value µ[improved]

max

= 2/3 for the radius of convergence. In a

broader context, it is therefore not surprizing that the underlying idea of expanding

a suitable function of E (in our case, a square) rather than this observable quantity

itself did ﬁnd non-trivial applications elsewhere [17].

The transition from E to its square Ω inspires also a slightly counterintuitive

re-arrangement of our secular polynomial in an incompletely factorized form where

the small corrections are manifestly separated,

(Ω

9) (Ω

1) = 36 µ2 .

−

−

This deﬁnes an explicit analytic continued-fraction re-arrangement of the complete,

“perturbed” Ω(µ) = Ω(0) + µ2ω(µ). For example, once we select Ω(0) = E2

1,4 = 9,

we arrive at the easily veriﬁed identity

Ω(µ2) = 5 + 2

4 + 9 µ2 = 9 +

The backward conversion of the analytic continued fraction on the right-hand side

to the plain perturbative power series in µ2 is routine [18] and almost as trivial as

its above-mentioned Taylor-series derivation from the left-hand-side square root.

3.3 Convergence of iterations: matrix dimension N = 5

Our experience gained from the preceding, completely and easily solvable examples

applies to all of the higher N’s in a more or less straightforward manner. Firstly, by

extrapolation we conjecture (and subsequently verify) that the “optimally shifted”

small parameter µ is always deﬁned by eq.

In full parallel with N = 4 it is easy to show that µmax = 1/(2 √2). This time, the do-

main of the perturbative convergence covers more than we really need. On its bound-
ary we set m = 0 and D = 1 and get µ = µmax phys = 1/4 < 1/(2 √2) = µmax math.

In comparison with N = 4 a tendency is observed towards and improvement of the

overall rate of convergence, which are good news in the light of our intention to move

towards any N in principle.

Let us once more recollect the existence of the N = 4 continued fractions for Ω’s.

It is related to the partial factorization of the secular equation which may be easily

The proof of its convergence is easy when performed in the spirit of the ﬁxed-

Indeed, the mapping Z[old])

ﬁxed points, the values of which are known and given by the quadratic equation
Z (±)
[F P ] = Z[old]) = Z[new]. In the next step one imagines that in the vicinity of these
two points, the obvious suﬃcient condition for the convergence/divergence of intera-

tions of our mapping (i.e., of our continued fraction with constant coeﬃcients) is that
the derivative Y (z) = Z ′

[new] (of the dependent variable Z = Z[new] with respect to
the independent variable z = Z[old])) is smaller/bigger than one in its absolute value,

respectively [19, 20]. We have all the necessary quantities at our disposal so that

the criterion is veriﬁed by trivial insertions. In perturbative regime of the smallest

We described this proof of convergence of continued fractions in full detail because

its idea is easily transferred to all the higher dimensions N. In the language of ﬁxed

points (or accumulation points), one can also better understand the transition to the

power-series perturbation expansions of our squared energies Ω(µ2). They may be

re-constructed directly from the recurrences [20], without any recourse to the closed

square-root formulae.

Both the existence and the simplicity of this relation opens to us new horizons.

We realize that we may succeed in an algebraic determination of the perturbation

representations of the roots in an almost as closed form as above. What is now vital

is that the construction does not still require any explicit knowledge of the roots and

might remain feasible at the higher N’s.

Once we return to eqs. (17) and (19) for guidance, we ﬁnd that a speciﬁc gener-

alization of the continued fractions exists at N = 6 since Firstly, perturbation anzatz

Ω(µ2) = 1 + µ2 ω(µ2) converts equation (21) into iterative recipe

slowly grows again.

Whenever necessary, one can establish a number of parallels between iterations

(23) and the current theory of continued fractions [18]. In particular, the ﬁxed-point

13

pattern of the proofs of convergence of ref.

[19] applies to functions Ω(µ2) at both

N = 4 or 5 and N = 6 (and, as we shall see below, 7). Thus, for the “ﬁrst nontrivial”
N = 6 mapping ω(k)

ω(k)
[new], we may skip the details (like, e.g., all the small

λ

[old] −→

analysis) and emphasize only that the proof of the convergence of our branched

−

continued fraction consists of three steps now. Firstly, one demonstrates that there

is just one ﬁxed-point root which is compatible with the perturbation smallness of

corrections. Secondly, one conﬁrms that this “only acceptable” ﬁxed point is stable

(by showing that the derivative of the mapping at this point is suﬃciently small,

Y (z)

< 1). Finally, one shows that the stable point is unique, which follows from

|

|
the observation that

Y (z)

> 1 at the other two ﬁxed points.

|

For giving to the reader a rough estimate of the rate of convergence of the it-

erations, let us pick up a sample value of the parameter λ = µ2 = 1/10, giving

the fairly small Y (z)

3.5 Expansions at an arbitrary matrix dimension N

In a way which is outlined in Table 1 and which may be tested on the further

non-numerical QES constructions (with dimensions N = 7 – N = 9, i.e., up to

quartic-polynomials) as well as at any higher N, we have reached the stage where

the overall structure of secular polynomials is clear,

(Ω) =

The routine analysis conﬁrmed our expectations that at any N, the large parameters

ℓ or D entering the measure of smallness µ as deﬁned by eq. (13) are “optimally

shifted”. This assertion is supported by the following four reasons at least.

•

•

•

All the odd powers of µ disappear from the polynomial forms of the secular

determinants as well as from the perturbation expansions of the observable

quantities (energies).

Up to the dimension N = 9 which is already fairly large, the degree of our

“optimalized” secular polynomials does not exceed four; this means that their

factorization may be made non-numerically.

At all the larger N > 9, a partial (i.e., asymptotic, D

) factorization is

→ ∞

still feasible non-numerically in zero order. As a consequence, all the higher-

order

(µ2) corrections may be generated in the form which, in many a respect,

O

generalizes the analytic continued fraction.

Surprizingly enough, the use of our present generalizations of continued fractions

has led to a very transparent alternative to Cardano formulae at dimension as low

as N = 6. Similarly, at N = 7 we eliminate the trivial root E = 0 and get the rule

of the analytic continued fractions. Similarly, at N = 6 and N = 7 we get their

branched alterantive. At all the higher N

immediate rational generalization of the latter two concepts.

All these matrices are asymmetric but idempotent, P 2 = I. This implies that the

Hamiltonian in our zero-order QES sextic Schr¨odinger equation H (0)~p(0) = ~p(0)E(0)

need not be diagonalized at all. Indeed, as long as the N

plets of the zero-order

(lower-case) vectors ~p(0) are concatenated into the above-mentioned (upper-case) N

by N matrices P = P (0), we may also collect all the pertaining eigenvalues E(0) in a

diagonal matrix ε(0). In this arrangement, the unperturbed Hamiltonian is factorized,

H (0) = P ε(0)P . As a consequence, the zero-order equation is an identity since, in

our compactiﬁed notation, it reads P ε(0)P P = P ε(0) and we know that P 2 = I. In

the next section we show that and how similar notation may be used in all orders.

4.2 Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation recipe revisited

We have seen that

At any ﬁnite value of the spatial dimension D we have seen in section 3 that the

routine power-series ansatz of perturbation theory becomes applicable even though

the unperturbed Hamiltonian H(µ) itself is non-diagonal. We may write

H(λ) = H (0) + λ H (1),

λ = µ2

18

where the perturbation is an asymmetric one-diagonal matrix in our particular il-

lustrative example. Even without the latter constraint we arrive at the textbook

perturbative representation of our matrix Schr¨odinger equation,

H (0) + λ H (1)

p(0) + λ p(1) + . . . + λKp(K) +

etc. This is a hierarchy of equations representing their source (33) order-by-order

in λ. Their new merit lies in their recurrent character. Their “old” or “input”

data occur on the right-hand side of these equations, while the “new” or “unknown”

quantities stand to the left. All the higher-order prescriptions have the same struc-

ture. In all of them, the diagonal part of each equation (i.e., of (34) or (35) etc)

determines the diagonal matrices containing energy corrections (i.e., ε(1) or ε(2) etc,

respectively). Non-diagonal components of these matrix relations are to be under-

stood as deﬁnitions of the eigenvectors, with an appropriate account of the well

known normalization freedom which has been thoroughly discussed elsewhere [21].

All these relations just re-tell the story of our preceding section but after an appro-

priate modiﬁcation they may also be used for the evaluation of separate corrections

in some more complicated QES systems [10].

In the conclusion, we may emphasize that the practical reliability of any pertur-

bation prescription is, mostly, determined by the quality of the zero-order approxi-

mation. In this sense, our present study oﬀers also a broadening of their menu. In the

light of our results one will be forced to make a more careful selection between the ES

19

and QES V [(Q)ES](

). Indeed, in each of these respective extremes one encounters

diﬀerent diﬃculties. Still, the simpler ES-based choice of V0(

) is predominantly

~r
|

|

preferred in practice. Almost without exceptions, such a decision is being made for

~r
|

|

one of the following three apparently good reasons.

•

•

•

Up to now, many QES-based constructions stayed within the mere lowest-

order perturbation regime since the majority of the naive implementations of

the Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation scheme becomes complicated in the high

orders [8].

A priori, any available set of the QES bound states ψ0 is, by deﬁnition, incom-

plete. This makes the matrix form of the pertaining propagators non-diagonal

and, hence, not too easy to use even in the lowest orders.

Last but not least, many ambitious QES models cannot be used as eligible for

perturbations because they are almost frighteningly complicated even in zero

order [6, 9].

Within our new perturbation prescription, all these shortcomings were at least par-

tially weakened. At the same time, the appeal of the ES-based perturbation con-

structions should at least slightly be re-evaluated as well: (i) the class of the available

V [ES](

~r
|

|

) is really extremely narrow for many practical purposes; (ii) several impor-

tant (e.g., double-well) models lead to a perturbation which is not “suﬃciently small”

in the sense of Kato [22]; (iii) one needs to go to the really very high perturbations

in many cases of practical interest [23].

In such a setting we showed that the technical treatment of the QES-type zero-

order approximations can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed. This could help, say, in situa-

tions where we have to deal with a phenomenological potential V (r) which cannot

be well approximated by any available exactly solvable V [ES](

) while there exists

an exceedingly good approximation of V (r) by a partially solvable V [QES](

). Un-

~r

der this assumption we may recommend the present construction as a guide to new

applications of the old large

ℓ expansion idea [24], especially when a very high order

−

20

N characterizes the polynomial part of the QES wave function ψ[N ](r), which would

makes the simple-minded zero-order construction prohibitively complicated by itself.

5 Summary

The problem of construction of large QES multiplets has been addressed here within

the framework of the so called large

ℓ expansion method.

Its key idea is very

−

popular and re-emerges whenever radial Schr¨odinger equation is considered at a

large angular momentum ℓ. Originally, this attracted our attention because in all

these recipes there exists an obvious ambiguity in a free choice between alternative

small parameters λ = 1/ℓ and λshif ted = 1/(ℓ + β). We should remind the reader

that there exist in fact many alternative shifted-large

ℓ versions of the expansions

which use this freedom in diﬀerent ways [25] but, mostly, this parameter plays a

−

certain not too essential variational role. In this context, the position of our present

approach may be exceptional; in QES context the role of our “optimal” and unique

β happened to be much more essential, inﬂuencing not only the rate of convergence

but also, directly, the form of the perturbation series itself.

Thus, although in most cases the transition to a shifted large

ℓ expansion is being

−

designed to extend its practical applicability, we imagined that the construction of

the N

plets of quasi-exact sextic-oscillator bound states ψ[N ]

n (r) does not admit any
free choice of the shift β at all. On the contrary, our approach has been shown to

−

prefer the unique, “optimal” deﬁnition of the shift β = β(N) which leads to one of

the best available constructions of the QES spectrum. This is our main result.

Our secondary motivation stemmed from the fact that whenever one moves be-

yond the ﬁrst few trivial multiplet dimensions N, the practical appeal of QES so-

lutions fades away. In this sense we have veriﬁed once more that one of the most

eﬃcient strategies of solving “diﬃcult” Schr¨odinger equation is provided by the stan-

dard Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation series [22] and by many of its various prac-

tical modiﬁcations and alternative implementations [4]. We succeeded in developing

a prescription with several merits described throughout the text.

21

In a broader methodical setting we were guided by the idea that the quality

of perturbative results depends on the two decisive factors, viz., on the number

of the available perturbation corrections and on the rate of convergence of their

series. In both these aspects our new approach passes the test very well. We have

seen that in comparison with the standard approach summarized for our present

purposes in section 2.2, we arrived at the more compact and, presumably, most

easily generated representation of our QES energies. Moreover, in a sharp contrast

to the manifest divergence of the former (though, admittedly, more universal) recipe

[15], our algebraic approach represents the QES spectra by convergent inﬁnite series.

Our new implementation of some old ideas of perturbation theory looks promising

and will deﬁnitely serve as a guide to the more complicated QES constructions in

the future. For the sake of simplicity we have chosen just one of the simplest models

where the sextic oscillator is not even complemented by a quartic force and admits

merely a quadratic repulsion near the origin. This simpliﬁed many technicalities and

strengthened our belief that any future transition to models with more parameters

may and will proceed along the same lines.

We present a numerial exerise in whih lassial and non-lassial eletrostati potentials were

alulated. The non-lassial (cid:28)elds take into aount e(cid:27)ets due to a possible non-zero photon rest

potential an be found by solving Poisson's equation twie, using the (cid:28)rst alulation as a soure

term in the seond alulation. Our results support the assumptions in a reent proposal to use ion

interferometry to searh for a non-zero photon rest mass.

dutor is Earth grounded, due to the huge apaitane of

the Earth it is reasonable to assume that Vg will remain

periodially reversed. Rather than measuring the (cid:28)eld

inside the ondutor, the di(cid:27)erene between the (cid:28)eld be-

fore and after the reversal would be measured. In this

measurement the the unknown voltage o(cid:27)set Vg will an-

us meaningful results.

IV. METHODOLOGY

We did our alulations using a (cid:28)nite di(cid:27)erene

method, in whih the potential is alulated at points

on a grid. Derivatives are approximated to seond order

(3)

spaed in both dimensions, with points separated by a

distane a. The potential φx at eah point on the grid
will be written as φi,j and the soure term y at eah point
as yi,j , where i and j are integers labeling the point. We
will de(cid:28)ne i = j = 0 at the enter of the onduting

shells, suh that the atual oordinates of eah grid point

are equal to ri = ai and zj = aj . Using these de(cid:28)nitions,

We began our simulation with an arbitrary value of

φi,j at eah grid point. Then using Gauss-Seidel iteration

[8℄, this equation was evaluated at eah point to produe

an updated value of φi,j . After many iterations, φi,j

eventually onverged to the orret values to solve Eq. 6.

To aelerate onvergene, we used the suessive over-

relaxation method [8℄.

One group of points whih requires attention are the

points for whih i = 0. Beause r is always positive
in ylindrial oordinates, φi,j is not de(cid:28)ned for nega-
tive values of i. But there is e(cid:27)etively no di(cid:27)erene be-

tween ylindrial and Cartesian oordinates for the row

of points along the axis. So for these points we alulated

In this proess the fra-

derivatives using Cartesian oordinates knowing that the

tional error of the outermost olumn of points (the dark grey

points diretly below the axis and just into or out of the

olumn) is evaluated. If the frational error for eah of these

two-dimensional grid should have the same value as the

points is less than a set value, the grid size is redued and the

point diretly above eah point on the axis. This gives

If the error for eah point in this olumn is smaller than the

olumn is found whih has at least one point with a frational

error larger than the spei(cid:28)ed limit.

In this example, the

mirrored symmetry about their enter. This allows us to

throw away all of the grid points with j < 0, utting the

number of grid points in half. Doing this requires us to

treat the j = 0 points di(cid:27)erently, beause our grid no
longer ontain values for φi,−1 . By symmetry we know
that φi,j = φi,−j . This allows us to replae φi,−1 with
φi,1 in Eq. 7. The point φ0,0 is a speial point, being
both a member of the r = 0 and z = 0 groups of points.
For this point we use Eq. 8, but substitute φ0,1 for φ0,−1 .

After every 100 iterations, the program alulated an

estimated error at eah point by evaluating Eq. 7 at eah

point without hanging any values on the grid. We de-

(cid:28)ned the estimated frational error to be

where φi,j is the atual value at grid point (i,j ) and Φi,j

is the value alulated from Eq. 7. If there were no points

on the grid with a frational error larger than 10−8

, the

next set of 100 iterations was performed. This proess is

illustrated in Fig. 2.

The error introdued by stepping in should be negli-

gible; if a olumn has onverged to within a fator f of

its (cid:28)nal value, the error introdued onto other points by

(cid:16)freezing(cid:17) this olumn should be of order f . Therefore,
for a grid with Nz olumns, the largest frational error

introdued anywhere on the grid by this method should

be on the order of f √Nz if the errors are assumed to be
random, and on the order of f Nz or smaller otherwise.

Beause we have not done a rigorous theoretial study

of this method, one we had deided on the (cid:28)nal geom-

While experimenting with di(cid:27)erent ondutor geome-

To verify the validity of our results we used a series so-

lution to alulate the (cid:28)eld inside of the inner ondutor

assuming that the inner ondutor was grounded, and

that the potential inside of the radial slies in the end

aps was a (cid:28)xed onstant. This alulation showed that

the potential at the enter of the tube would be 4.5

times the potential inside the radial slies, in good agree-

ment with our numerial alulation. We also found a

series solution for the (cid:28)eld between two grounded ylin-

ders with a (cid:28)xed potential applied to the gap at the ends.

The length of the ylinders was assumed to be equal to

the sum of the lengths of the two end aps, with a gap

between them equal in size to the radial slie in the end

aps. The (cid:28)eld in the enter of the gap turned out to be

To alulate φs , we set y = φc in Eq. 3 and used the

same methods disussed above. Sine the potential on

the onduting surfaes is given, the deviation from the

lassial potential should be zero on these surfaes. So

the boundary onditions for the φs alulation were that
φs = 0 on both of the ondutors.

The soure term y in this alulation is equal to φc . We
an obtain this by adding V to our already ompleted al-
ulation of ∆φc . Inside the inner ondutor, where ∆φc

is very small, this results in values aurate to the total

preision allowed by the double-preision (cid:29)oating-point

format. But between the two ondutors, adding V to
∆φc results in lost preision. We are only interested in

the (cid:28)elds inside the inner ondutor, whih should not be

a(cid:27)eted by this lost preision (cid:22) the non-lassial poten-

tial is predominantly generated by the loal soure term

y rather than from fringing (cid:28)elds generated outside the

inner ondutor. But to be extra areful we also alu-

lated φc diretly using the orret boundary onditions
(the inner ondutor at V and the outer one at 0), and
used these values wherever φc was less than V /2.

all that is important is the (cid:28)eld at the loation of the ion

beam. As suh, the most important information in this

(cid:28)gure is the radial slope of the potential at r = 25 m.

In Fig. 4(a) we see that the non-lassial (cid:28)eld is ap-

proximated very well by the (cid:28)eld of an in(cid:28)nite ylinder.

In Fig. 4(b) we see that although the e(cid:27)et of small ob-

jets inside the shell on the non-lassial potential is not

negligible, it should not greatly hange the sensitivity of

the experiment as long as are is taken. Beause ax-

ial symmetry is assumed, the additional ondutors took

the form of large rings rather than small retangles whih

would better approximate an optial mount, and this plot

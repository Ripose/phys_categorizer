Abstract. An eﬃcient way of solving 2D stability problems in ﬂuid
mechanics is to use, after discretization of the equations that cast the
problem in the form of a generalized eigenvalue problem, the incomplete
Arnoldi-Chebyshev method. This method preserves the banded struc-
ture sparsity of matrices of the algebraic eigenvalue problem and thus
decreases memory use and CPU-time consumption.
The errors that aﬀect computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors are due to
the truncation in the discretization and to ﬁnite precision in the com-
putation of the discretized problem. In this paper we analyze those two
errors and the interplay between them. We use as a test case the two-
dimensional eigenvalue problem yielded by the computation of inertial
modes in a spherical shell. This problem contains many diﬃculties that
make it a very good test case. It turns out that that single modes (espe-
cially most-damped modes i.e. with high spatial frequency) can be very
sensitive to round-oﬀ errors, even when apparently good spectral conver-
gence is achieved. The inﬂuence of round-oﬀ errors is analyzed using the
spectral portrait technique and by comparison of double precision and
extended precision computations. Through the analysis we give practical
recipes to control the truncation and round-oﬀ errors on eigenvalues and
eigenvectors.

1 Introduction

The ﬁrst step in studying the stability of the solutions of a nonlinear problem,
is to solve the eigenvalue problem associated with inﬁnitesimal pertubations
which are superposed to the equilibrium state. Even if the equations of these
perturbations are linear, solving the eigenvalue problem may be a formidable
task. The diﬃculties arise in general when the variables do not separate. In
such a case, the eigenvalue problem cannot be reduced to a set of smaller (one-
dimensional) eigenvalue problems and one is left with a 2D or 3D problem.

In most cases, after discretization of the equations, the temporal stability
problem reduces to a generalized eigenvalue problem. A method to solve such
problems is to use the QZ algorithm. Such an algorithm gives the full spec-
trum of eigenvalues/eigenvectors, but the price to pay for obtaining this very
rich information is very high in terms of memory requirement and CPU time
consumption. Moreover the QZ algorithm does not preserve the sparsity of the
matrices. On the other hand it is seldom needed to know the full spectrum: typi-
cally one is interested in the few eigenvalues corresponding to the least stable or
most unstable modes. For the foregoing reasons it is important to be able to solve
the generalized eigenvalue problem with an iterative method which preserves the
sparsity of the matrices and converges quickly and accurately to a small sub-
set of the whole spectrum. Three types of iterative methods exist to solve such
eigenproblems [8,9]. The ﬁrst method is the subspace iterations method which is
just a generalization of the well-known power method. A second method is the
Jacobi-Davidson algorithm. The third one is to use Krylov based methods such
as the Arnoldi method or the unsymmetric Lanczos method. Comparisons [11]
between the subspace iterations method and the Krylov type ones tend to show
that the second ones are more eﬃcient when applied on large sparse matrices.
We have chosen to use the Arnoldi method because it is easy to implement. Its
backward stability is now well understood and it does not require any heuristics
whereas numerical diﬃculties such as serious breakdowns can be encountered
using the unsymmetric Lanczos method.

In this paper we consider as a model problem the computation of the inertial
modes of a rotating spherical shell. This problem contains many diﬃculties that
make it a very good test case. A ﬁrst diﬃculty is that the problem is essentially
two-dimensional, because variables such as the radial distance and the polar an-
gle cannot be separated. The size of the matrices thus grows very quickly with
the resolution; for parameters of physical interest matrices are of order 105 or
larger. The second diﬃculty is that the partial diﬀerential equations become
of hyperbolic type and therefore yields, with boundary conditions, an ill-posed
problem [14,13]. Solving this eigenvalue problem is therefore demanding numeri-
cally. The third diﬃculty is that matrices are highly non-normal. The eigenvalue
spectrum is thus very sensitive to machine precision and special tools must be
used to analyze and control the round-oﬀ errors. Our analysis revealed some
interesting aspects from the viewpoint of numerical precision. In particular we
think that our results on the behaviour of round-oﬀ and spectral errors and their
interplay are useful in many ﬁelds of physics where two-dimensional eigenvalue
problems appear.

We organized the paper as follows: we ﬁrst describe the physics of our test
problem and how we discretize it using spectral methods (section 2). We also
brieﬂy recall the principle of the incomplete Arnoldi-Chebyshev algorithm (sec-
tion 3). We then discuss the role of spectral resolution (sect. 4) and presents
our results about the behaviour of round-oﬀ errors (sect. 5); conclusions and
outlooks follow.

2 The test-problem

2.1 Formulation

We consider the problem of ﬁnding the modes of oscillation of a rigidly rotating
ﬂuid contained in a spherical shell; it is investigated for its astrophysical and
geophysical applications (see [14,13] for a detailed discussion). Eigenmodes of
this system are called inertial modes.

The ﬂuid is contained between two spheres of radii ηR and R (η < 1) and
rotates at an angular velocity Ω around the z-axis. Choosing R as the length
scale and (2Ω)−1 as the time scale, the non-dimensional form of the equations
for the equations governing perturbations are:

where λ is the eigenvalue (a non-dimensional frequency) and E = ν/2ΩR2 is the
Ekman number. E is the non-dimensional measure of the kinematic viscosity ν
and is usually a small parameter (E < 10−4).

Equations (1) are completed by boundary conditions on the velocity taken

at r = η and r = 1. We impose stress-free boundary conditions, namely that

2.2 Numerical method

We discretize the preceding partial diﬀerential equations using spectral methods
because of their eﬃciency at convergence [10,3].

For obvious geometrical reasons, the angular part of the ﬁelds is expanded

on spherical harmonics; hence, we set

Following some simple rules, given in [12], the equation of vorticity (1a) may
m(r)

be projected rather easily on spherical harmonics. The radial functions uℓ

System (2) is an inﬁnite set of diﬀerential equations where the coupling between
radial functions of indices ℓ
1, ℓ and ℓ+1 is due to the Coriolis force. Note that
−
diﬀerent m’s are not coupled.

For the discretization in radial coordinate we approximate the radial func-
tions by truncated expansions of N+1 Chebyshev polynomials. Thus, each of the
functions may be represented either by its spectral components or by its values
on the Gauss-Lobatto collocation nodes. We use the latter representation. In
such case, diﬀerential operators dk/drk are represented by full matrices of order
(N +1). As system (2) couples radial functions of indices ℓ
1, ℓ and ℓ + 1, it
yields a generalized eigenvalue problem with tridiagonal block matrices which
we write symbolically:

3 The Incomplete Arnoldi-Chebyshev Method

For eﬃciency reasons and memory requirements, the generalized eigenvalue prob-
lem (3) should be solved using an iterative method because the matrices are large
and sparse. As previously stated, a good method is the incomplete Arnoldi-
Chebyshev method which we now brieﬂy recall.

For applications to stability problems, one is mostly interested in the least-
stable (or most unstable) eigenmodes which are associated with the generalized
eigenvalues λ with the greatest real part. Since these eigenvalues obviously do
not belong to the outside part of the spectrum, we have to perform a spectral
transformation. Let (µ, y) be the solutions of

σ[B])

−1[B]y = µy.

([A]

(4)

Then, one easily shows that (λ = σ + 1/µ, x = y). Thanks to this spectral
transformation, the eigenvalues near the shift (the guess) σ are sent to the out-
side part of the spectrum and the Arnoldi method can now deliver the desired
eigenpair very eﬃciently. The derived method can be summarized as follows

This algorithm requires a matrix-vector product involving the matrix [B] and
a linear solver to compute z2 solution of ([A]

[A] and [B] are banded matrices, so that a band linear solver from LAPACK
has been used. The internal dense eigensolver in step 2 has been taken from
EISPACK. The interested reader is referred to [4,2,6,5] for more details.

4 The role of spatial resolution

We ﬁrst study the convergence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors as a function of the
resolution. The two relevant parameters are the degree of the largest Chebyshev
polynomial (equal to the number of radial nodes N minus one) and the degree
L of the last spherical harmonic. We deal only with axisymmetric m = 0 modes
and therefore drop the index m (no additional diﬃculty arises when m

= 0).

In the following we use the notation ω for the imaginary part of the eigenvalue
τ + iω. All the modes of our

(the frequency), and τ for the real part. Thus λ
test-problem are stable, i.e. τ < 0, and

Both spectra are ﬁlled because inertial modes display very ﬁne structures
(see [14] for typical spectra and eigenfunctions occurring at Ekman numbers as
low as E = 10−8).

Here, we take a moderately small value of the Ekman number: E = 10−4 so
that the full eigenvalue spectrum can be explored with an aﬀordable resolution.
As it may be expected, eigenvalues with smaller
require less resolution to
converge than those with large damping rate (see ﬁgures 1(a) and 1(b)). This
is easily understood since eigenvectors with small
tend to have a smoother
pattern, which is well approximated by a small number of spectral modes.

The convergence of eigenvalues as a function of spatial resolution goes to-
gether with that of eigenvectors: unless all the scales present in the eigenvector
are resolved, both the eigenvector and the eigenvalue are not well approximated.
This observation allows us to give a simple rule to check the convergence of
the eigenvalue. Let us deﬁne the ratio fL between the lowest spherical harmon-
ics coeﬃcient and the largest one, and deﬁne gN as the same ratio but for the
Chebyshev expansion.

These two ratios measure the truncation error in the spherical harmonic expan-
sion (fL) and in the Chebyshev expansion (gN ). We next deﬁne ε as the absolute
value of the diﬀerence between the computed eigenvalue and the converged one
(i.e. obtained with a large resolution).

In ﬁgure 2 we plot ε as a function of fL. The number of Chebyshev polyno-
mials was chosen large enough to resolve completely the radial dependence. We
f 2
clearly see that ε follows the law ε
L until a plateau is reached. The plateau
appears at the largest resolutions and indicates that no better approximation
to the eigenvalue can be obtained by increasing the resolution. It gives thus a
measure of the round-oﬀ error of the computation. From the curves obtained
for diﬀerent eigenmodes, we see that the round-oﬀ error is a rapidly increasing
function of the damping rate.

∝

In ﬁgure 3 we plot ε as a function of the parameter gN . Here the number of
spherical harmonics was set large enough to fully resolve the angular dependence.
The Chebyshev convergence appears to be governed by the law ε
gN . Here
too, good convergence is obtained only for least-damped modes. We note also
that the plateau values are very close to those of the preceding ﬁgure.

∝

5 The importance of round-oﬀ errors

The foregoing results indicate that round-oﬀ errors play a major role in the
accuracy of the numerical solution, especially for strongly damped modes. We
shall now investigate this point more thoroughly.

First, we stress the fact that good spectral convergence is not at all a guaran-
tee against round-oﬀ errors. This point can be made very clear using the mode
displayed on ﬁgure 1(b) for example. No doubts that for such a mode the spectral
expansion has converged: there are 12 decades in the Chebyshev spectrum and
16 decades in the Legendre spectrum; however the whole spectrum is subject
to large round-oﬀ error at all wavenumbers. To illustrate this point we consider
two diﬀerent computations where we only change the value of the shift σ (see
equation (4)) of the Arnoldi-Chebyshev algorithm: σ =
0.51 + i0.65458 in the
ﬁrst case and σ =
0.51 + i0.65558 in the second case. In both computations
the Ekman number is E = 10−4, L = 120 and N = 64; the Arnoldi-Chebyshev
algorithm converges to the same eigenmode. The Chebyshev and Legendre spec-
tra for the ﬁrst case are those represented on ﬁgure 1(b); the two spectra for the

where subscript 1 (resp. 2) corresponds to ﬁrst (resp. second) eigenvector. We see
that the relative diﬀerence is spread almost uniformly throughout the wavenum-
bers, until round-oﬀ error in the spectrum is reached, where necessarily the
relative error grows to
(1). This uniform spreading is not surprising; in [1] it is
shown that for Chebyshev expansions the spectral round-oﬀ error of diﬀerential
operators is distributed uniformly among wavenumbers.

O

The round-oﬀ error may be investigated quite systematically by computing

the spectral portrait of this eigenvalue problem.

Spectral portraits and pseudospectra have recently attracted the attention
as a tool of choice for investigating spectral properties of nonnormal matrices
(see [7,15,16]). It consists in the representation of the map

in a prescribed region of the complex plane. The contour lines of level ε of the
spectral portrait are the borders of the ε-pseudospectrum of the matrix pair

If ε is chosen as the backward error for a computed eigenvalue ˜λ, then the
contour line of level ε encloses all the complex numbers with the same backward
error ε for the pair (A, B). The larger the enclosed area, the worse-conditioned
the eigenvalue. The diameter of the enclosed area gives an idea of the largest
possible relative error on ˜λ. For a semi-simple eigenvalue, it is always possible to
bound the error on ˜λ by the product of the condition number and the backward
error. This is not possible for multiple defective eigenvalues and the spectral
portrait is a useful alternative.

On the example studied here, the computation is backward stable : we can
then look at the contour line of level machine precision that is 10−16 (only
“
log10 ε” appears on the ﬁgures). We see that this level curve encloses a large
region of the spectrum, which tends to indicate a signiﬁcant spectral instability
in the matrix pairs under study.

−

We display in ﬁgure 5 the spectral portrait for our eigenvalue problem using
a resolution of L = 70 and N = 40 which corresponds to matrices of order 3150.
We superpose the eigenvalues obtained using the QZ algorithm (black points)
and the isolines of spectral portrait. For values of the spectral portrait larger
than approximately 16 (lower part of the ﬁgure) the computed eigenvalues are
completely undetermined in double precision. This corresponds to damping rates
larger than 0.25 approximately.

However, computation of pseudospectra is an expensive task and it is there-
fore not feasible on production runs. There have been recent developments in
the algorithms whereby one can obtain an approximation to the pseudospectra
in a region near the interesting eigenvalues at reasonable cost [17,18]. However,
those techniques must be used with special care as they are not totally reliable

used routinely to evaluate the sensitivity of eigenvalues to round-oﬀ error is to
compute the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed matrices. This technique can
be used without further coding on any eigenvalue solver, yet one must code the
perturbations to the matrix elements. In the following we explore the impact of
round-oﬀ errors by means of matrix perturbation, and present a new technique
which gives the same results but does not require any coding at all.

In a second series of 50000 computations we did not perturb the matrices
A and B but instead we perturbed the value of the Arnoldi-Chebyshev shift
σ by a small random quantity near the exact eigenvalue. With this method
there is no need to modify the source code for the eigenvalue solver and/or for
the construction of the matrices: we only need to change the shift parameter
σ on input to the eigenvalue solver. We obtain a cloud of eigenvalues (ﬁgure
7) which looks almost identical to that obtained in ﬁgure 6. Each point in the
ﬁgure is the eigenvalue obtained by changing the real and imaginary part of
the shift around the exact eigenvalue by random values uniformly distributed in
10−5, 10−5). Actually we have veriﬁed that the statistics does not
the interval (
depend on the amplitude of the shift perturbation. So there is no need to know
a priori the exact value of the eigenvalue: any value of the shift which delivers
the wanted eigenmode is good. The statistical values in table 1 conﬁrm that the
statistics of the eigenvalues obtained in the two approaches are almost the same.
In a third series of 50000 computations the matrices A and B are perturbed
as in the ﬁrst series by random values uniformly distributed in the interval
10−16. However in this series the computation is

diﬀerence between the standard deviations of the ﬁrst two series and the present
one: this means that the Arnoldi-Chebyshev algorithm adds an extra factor of
order of magnitude 103 to the round-oﬀ error.

6 Conclusions

We have analyzed in this paper the errors that arise from the discretization and
numerical computation of partial diﬀerential eigenvalue problems yielding large
matrices. We have chosen as a model problem the two-dimensional eigenvalue
problem yielded by the computation of inertial modes in a spherical shell.

We have solved this problem using spectral methods for discretization and
the incomplete Arnoldi-Chebyshev algorithm for solving the eigenvalue problem.
The combination of these methods provides an eﬃcient solver for these large
(two-dimensional) eigenvalue problems.

We have shown that the convergence of the eigenvalue and the eigenvector,
with respect to spatial truncation, are tightly related: the absolute error of the
eigenvalue decreases linearly with the Chebyshev truncation error, and quadrati-
cally with the spherical harmonics truncation error, until round-oﬀ error becomes
dominant.

We found that most-damped modes are the most ill-conditioned and are
therefore more sensitive to round-oﬀ error. This is made clear by the spectral
portrait of the linear operator. Its computation is however very expensive and can
be done only on small test problems. We have shown that a good estimation of
the round-oﬀ error can be done in practice by performing diﬀerent computations
changing only the value of the Arnoldi-Chebyshev shift parameter on input; there
is no need to do extra coding and/or to use external tools. It turns out that the
round-oﬀ error on eigenvalues has an almost normal distribution, a result which
can be used to reduce this kind of error. If the computation of a single eigenmode
is not too expensive one could take advantage of this distribution of errors and
perform N computations with random shifts; one can thus reduce the round-oﬀ
error of the estimated eigenvalue by a factor √N .

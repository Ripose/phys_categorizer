Abstract

We assert that the physics underlying the extraordinary light transmition (reﬂec-
tion) in nanostructured materials can be understood from rather general principles
based on the formal scattering theory developed in quantum mechanics. The Maxwell’s
equations in passive (dispersive and absorptive) linear media are written in the form of
the Schr¨odinger equation to which the quantum mechanical resonant scattering theory
(the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism) is applied. It is demonstrated that the existence
of long-lived quasistationary eigenstates of the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the Maxwell’s
theory naturally explains the extraordinary transmission properties observed in various
nanostructured materials. Such states correspond to quasistationary electromagnetic
modes trapped in the scattering structure. Our general approach is also illustrated with
an example of the zero-order transmission of the TE-polarized light through a metal-
dielectric grating structure. Here a direct on-the-grid solution of the time-dependent
Maxwell’s equations demonstrates the signiﬁcance of resonances (or trapped modes)
for the extraordinary light transmission.

1 Introduction

Supported by technological progress, studies of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation
with nanostructured materials have become an area of intense research driven by potential
applications in optics and photonics [1]–[4]. In particular, it has been found that metal [3]–
[16] and dielectric [17]–[24] grating structures posses extraordinary transmission (reﬂection)
properties within narrow intervals of wavelengths close to the grating period. While for
dielectric gratings a common point of view on this phenomenon, as occurring due to the ex-
istence of trapped modes or guided wave resonances [18]–[24], seems to be established, there
is still an ongoing discussion on the origin of a nearly 100% light transmission within narrow
wavelength range(s) observed in gratings and hole arrays made in metal ﬁlms. Although
similar results are obtained with diﬀerent theoretical approaches, in which the Maxwell’s
equations are numerically solved, an explanation of the underlying physics, as due to excita-
tions of coupled surface plasmons and/or cavity modes [5, 6], competes with the dynamical
diﬀraction theory point of view [9, 10]. Remarkably, all available studies of metal grating
structures have been carried out with the TM-polarized light (the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel
to the slits) where surface plasmons can indeed be excited.

Transmission and reﬂection properties of grating structures are typically studied by sta-
tionary methods in the frequency domain. Nevertheless the dynamics of light scattering
on gratings can partly be guessed from stationary results. Indeed, consider a femtosecond
(broad band) pulse impinging on a grating structure such that the spectral range of the pulse
is much larger than the grating transmission window(s). From the uncertainty principle it
follows that, in order for a transmission of light to occur only within a narrow frequency
range, the radiation should last much longer than the duration of the initial pulse. This
implies that the corresponding electromagnetic modes have to be trapped by the nanos-
tructured material during a suﬃciently long time. Such modes are known in the scattering
theory as scattering resonances [25].

Here we propose a general point of view on the physics underlying the extraordinary
light transmission in nanostructured materials. By reformulating the Maxwell’s equations
in the form of the Schr¨odinger equation and by using quantum scattering theory, we show
that this phenomenon is a direct consequence of the existence of trapped electromagnetic
modes possessing large lifetimes. Based on this general principle, various structures can
be custom-designed that would transmit or reﬂect light within a designated narrow wave-
length range(s). As an example to illustrate our approach, transmission properties of a
metal-dielectric grating structure are studied for the TE-polarized light (the electric ﬁeld
is parallel to the slits) impinging normally on the grating. A direct on-the-grid solution
of the time-dependent Maxwell’s equations demonstrates the signiﬁcance of resonances (or
trapped modes) for the enhanced light transmission. Interestingly enough, such a system
has never been studied before, probably, because of the absence of the coupling of electro-
magnetic modes to plasmons, often thought to be the main mechanism of the extraordinary
light transmission. It should be understood that our choice of the geometry does not imply
an attempt to favor either the plasmon or cavity–mode point of view in, generally, strongly
coupled systems.

2 Metal–Dielectric Grating

We begin with an example of a grating structure sketched in Fig. 1 to illustrate our basic
idea. The grating structure has a translation symmetry along one of the Euclidean axes,
chosen to be the y axis. The structure is periodic along the x axis with the period Dg,
and the z direction is transverse to the structure. For the sake of comparison with previous
works [5], the parameters are chosen to be: the grating period Dg = 1.75 µm, the thickness
(along the z axis) h = 0.8
In the
case of the TM radiation impinging the grating with no dielectric ﬁllings, the extraordinary
transmission properties have already been reported and analyzed [5, 7, 10, 11, 13]. The
question arises whether an enhanced transmission can be obtained for the TE radiation, or,
according to our remarks in the previous section, whether or not trapped modes exist and
can be excited.

To ﬁnd a rough estimate of wavelengths of possible trapped (or quasi-stationary) elec-
tromagnetic modes in the system, consider ﬁrst the case of the perfect metal grating. For a
moment, we also neglect the eﬀects due to a ﬁnite thickness of the grated metal slab in the
z-direction. In other words, we neglect the coupling between trapped modes and radiation
modes outside the grating. Then the x component of the wave vector is quantized as a
consequence of the zero boundary conditions at the metal-dielectric interface. A quantiza-
tion of the z component of the wave vector can be understood as Fabry-Perrot modes in a
dielectric slab inside the metallic waveguide, i.e., the modes for which the dielectric slab is
100% transparent. Admissible (quantized) values of the wave vector inside the grating de-

grating structure would reﬂect the TM radiation with λ

by our numerical simulations. This is in contrast to the TM radiation case where the 100%
transmission can be reached for the very same grating with no dielectric ﬁllings and made
of the perfect conductor [5].

plasma frequency and the attenuation are taken to be representative for silver: ωp = 9eV ,
and γ = 0.1eV [5]. Transmission and reﬂection properties of the grating structure are
calculated by means of the wave packet propagation method. The method is based on the
representation of the Maxwell’s equations in the form of the Schr¨odinger equation for which
the initial value problem is numerically solved by a time-stepping algorithm. A detailed
description can be found elsewhere [23, 24].

3 Results and discussion

In Fig. 2a we show an interpolated image of the time evolution of the electric ﬁeld Ey along
the z-axis passing through the center of the grating (see Fig. 1). The grating structure is
characterized by ε = 11.9, Dg = 1.75 µm, a = 0.35µm and h = 1.4µm. The red and blue
colors correspond, respectively, to positive and negative values of the ﬁeld. The horizontal
axis represents the z-coordinate expressed in units of the grating period, Dg. The grating
extends from z = 0 to z = h/Dg. The vertical axis represents the propagation time measured
in femto-seconds. The initial pulse impinging on the grating has a duration of approximately
25f s. The instant of the incidence on the grating followed by the main reﬂected signal is
clearly visible in the ﬁgure. One also observes that a fraction of the electromagnetic energy is
stored in the grating structure and leads to a long lasting radiation on both the transmission
and reﬂection sides. The lasing eﬀect extends to a ps time range, i.e., it is much longer
than the duration of the initial pulse. It can be explained as due to the existence of trapped
electromagnetic modes or resonances. It is the radiation of decaying trapped modes that
comes with the phase opposite to the corresponding harmonic in the initially reﬂected pulse
to the left from the grating structure and leads, ﬁnally, to the reduced reﬂection. The
same lasing eﬀect to the right from the grating structure is responsible for the extraordinary
transmission at the same frequency.

Figure 2b shows the dynamics of the electric ﬁeld Ey in the same setting, but the atten-
uation γ is set to zero. In this case, the trapped modes do not dissipate their energy into
the metal. As a result, they live longer, which is clearly seen from comparison of the color
intensity of the vertical strip in the middle of Figs. 2a and 2b (that represents the electric
ﬁeld of the trapped modes).

The calculated transmission coeﬃcient is presented in Fig. 3 as a function of the wave-
length expressed in units of the grating period, Dg. Each of the resonances seen in Fig. 3 is
associated with the corresponding trapped mode. The rough estimate (1) of their energies
(frequencies) can be improved by taking into account a penetration of the ﬁeld into the metal
whose dielectric properties are described by the Droude model. This yields

Equation (7) is solved numerically under the condition that E(x) must decay exponentially
outside the interval 0 < x < a (i.e., in the metal). For a = 0.35µm and h = 1.4µm,
this gives the following resonant wavelengths (expressed in the units of grating period):
λ1 = 1.493, λ2 = 1.352, λ3 = 1.185, λ4 = 1.031, λ5 = 0.899. The improved estimate of the
resonant wavelengths closely agrees with the results obtained from numerical simulations for
the exact problem only for the largest resonant wavelength (λ1 = 1.493). The wavelengths

5

corresponding to the maximum of the transmission coeﬃcient for higher modes are redshifted
as compared to the estimated values. A similar result was reported by Takakura [7], but
for the TM incident wave polarization. The redshift can be explained by spreading of the
trapped modes into the vacuum due to a ﬁnite thickness of the grating (see also Fig.4 and
its discussion below), while the Fabry-Perrot modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, used in
our rough estimate, satisfy the zero boundary condition at the dielectric-vacuum interface.
Clearly, such an increase of the spatial volume occupied by a standing wave implies increasing
its wavelength and, hence, lowering its frequency.

Because of dissipative losses of energy in the Drude metal, the transmittance does not
reach 100% and is, in fact, small. While for a lossless medium the sum of the reﬂection
and transmission coeﬃcients must be one as follows from the electromagnetic energy con-
servation, this is not the case when the attenuation is present (the blue curve in Fig. 3).
The maximal loss of energy corresponds to resonant wavelengths. It is easily understood be-
cause the trapped modes remain in contact with the metal much longer than the main pulse
(cf. Figs. 2a and 2b), and, therefore, can dissipate more energy through exciting surface
electrical currents in metal. We further illustrate this point by computing the transmission
coeﬃcient in the same system but without attenuation γ = 0. The result is shown by the

transmission coeﬃcient from 1 for the narrowest resonance at λ
1.5Dg even in the absence
of absorption. This resonance possesses an extremely long lifetime so that we had to stop
the calculation before it decayed completely, that is, the total energy trapped into this mode
was not completely radiated out and, hence, was not fully accounted for. For the resonance
at λ < Dg the transmission coeﬃcient does not reach 1 because we study only at the zero
diﬀraction order scattering channel.

Wave functions (ﬁeld conﬁgurations) of the trapped modes can be extracted from the

time-dependent wave packet by the time-to-frequency Fourier transform:

Ψ(ω) =

Ψ(t) eiωt dt .

(8)

The wave function of a particular trapped mode is obtained by setting ω to the frequency at
which the transmission coeﬃcient attains the corresponding maximum. In order to improve
the contrast, the wave functions have been extracted for the case with no attenuation. The
results are presented in Fig. 4 for the grating with parameters ε = 11.9, Dg = 1.75 µm,
a = 0.35µm, and h = 1.4µm. There are ﬁve colored strips in Fig. 4. From the top to
the bottom they correspond to, respectively, Ψm = Ψ(ωm = 2πc/λm) where m = 1, 2, ..., 5
(cf. Eq. (6)). The red and blue colors in each strip represent, respectively, negative and
positive values of the electric ﬁeld amplitude in the corresponding trapped mode Ψm as a
function of x and z for
0.26µm and the range for z is speciﬁed in the
ﬁgure. The greater color intensity corresponds to the greater ﬁeld magnitude. The localized
ﬁeld of trapped modes and associated with them radiative parts responsible for the lasing
eﬀect are clearly visible in the ﬁgure. The electric ﬁeld of trapped modes is well localized
inside the dielectric part of the grating and exhibits a nearly Fabry-Perrot pattern with
respect to the quantization in the z-direction. Observe a slight spreading of the ﬁeld into

the vacuum regions, z < 0 and z > h, which explains the redshift of the resonant wavelengths
as compared to the pure Fabry-Perrot prediction (1).

The structure of the ﬁeld in the present case is such that one can regard the grating
openings as an ensemble of independent emitters. They are coherently excited by the in-
cident pulse, and their coherent emission builds up the radiation ﬁeld associated with the
extraordinary transmission (reﬂection) properties of the grating. This is in contract with the
previously reported TM results, where the excitation of plasmons leads to the coupling be-
tween eﬀective emitters associated with the grating openings. This point is further illustrated
in Fig. 5, where we show the transmission coeﬃcient calculated for the grating structure
with parameters ε = 11.9, a = 0.3µm, h = 0.8µm, and diﬀerent periods Dg = D0
1.75µm,
Dg = D0/1.5, and Dg = D0/4. The change of the grating period does not aﬀect positions of
the peaks in the transmission coeﬃcient, pointing at the independence of the trapped ﬁeld
associated with diﬀerent openings. The overall increase of the transmission coeﬃcient, when
the grating period is reduced, is because of the increase of the density of emitters (openings),
while the time scale of the lasing aﬀect remains the same because it is set by the attenuation
of the metal. In agreement with Eq. (1), a direct comparison of the result for Dg = D0 with
the results presented in Fig. 3 shows that the reduction of h, and primarily of a, leads to
the blue shift of the whole resonance series.

4 The signiﬁcance of trapped modes in resonant scat-

tering

The example of the grating structure considered above suggests that the knowledge of long-
lived trapped modes is crusial for a custom design of nanostructured materials with en-
hanced transmission (reﬂection) properties in designated narrow intervals of wavelengths.
Here we oﬀer a rather general approach which establishes a direct relation between extraor-
dinary transmission (reﬂection) properties of nanostructured materials and the existence of
trapped modes. We assert that once the Maxwell’s equations have been reformulated in the
Schr¨odinger form, the signiﬁcance of trapped modes for the extraordinary light transmission
can immeaditely be understood from the basic principles of the quantum resonant scattering
theory [35].

Recall that the approach relies on a representation of the total wave function of the system
as a sum of non-resonant and resonant contributions [31, 32]. Consider the case without losses
so that the corresponding Hamiltonian is Hermitian. Let H be the total Hamiltonian of a
nanostructured material, supporting resonance(s), and H0 be a Hamiltonian responsible for a
non-resonant scattering. In the present case H and H0 are Hamiltonians of the metal grating
with and without dielectric insertions, respectively. The Lippmann-Schwinger formalism
[33, 34] is applied to describe the scattering of a plane wave on a scatterer that has resonant
excitations. Now we show that the existence of long-lived quasi-stationary states in the
grating with dielectric insertions implies that there exists a frequency at which the grating

Thus, in the absence of attenuation, the existence of trapped electromagnetic mode(s)
or resonances necessarily leads to the 100% transmission at the wavelengths of the trapped
modes in nanostructured materials which otherwise (in the absenece of such modes) are

not transparent. The same approach can be used to analyze a possible 100% reﬂection
in dielectric gratings, which otherwise (in the absence of trapped modes) are completely
transparent in the zero difraction order, as well as possible Fano proﬁles in the transmission
(reﬂection) coeﬃcient. It is worth mentioning that a singniﬁcant loss of the electromagnetic
energy in dispersive materials can strongly alter the above result because of the breaking of
the ﬂux conservation rule. This is clearly seen from our numerical results with and without
the attenuation.

5 Conclusions

We have elucidated the role of trapped modes in the extraordinary light transmission in
nanostructured materials by reformulating the Maxwell’s equation for passive linear media
in the form of the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation and applying to the latter the basic
principles of the quantum resonant scattering theory, in particular, the Lippmann-Schwinger
formalism. Trapped electromagnetic modes in nanostructured materials play the same role
as resonances in quantum scattering. This oﬀers well developed quantum mechanical tech-
niques to study resonant light transmission and reﬂection properties of gratings and other
nanostructured materials. We have illustrated this approach by a detailed numerical study
of a metal-dielectric grating. In particular, for the TE polarization of the normal incident
radiation, the grating, while being a total reﬂector in the zero difraction order when no
dielectric ﬁllings are present, has been shown to become transparent for certain (resonant)
wavelengths when the ﬁlling are present. In accord with the quantum resonant scattering
theory, stationary states have been observed in the latter case and none in the former.

Fig. 1.

A schematic representation of the studied system. The radiation is incident
along the normal to the slab with gratings (the z-direction). The dark grey and shaded
regions corresponds, respectively, to the metal and dielectric parts of the structure.

Fig. 2a.

(Color online) An interpolated image of the time evolution of the electric
ﬁeld Ey along the z-axis passing through the center of the grating (see Fig. 1). The grating
structure is characterized by ε = 11.9, Dg = 1.75 µm, a = 0.35µm, and h = 1.4µm. The red
and blue colors correspond, respectively, to positive and negative values of the ﬁeld. The
horizontal axis represents the z-coordinate expressed in units of the grating period, Dg. The
grating extends from z = 0 to z = h/Dg. The vertical axis represents the propagation time
measured in femto-seconds.

Fig. 2b.

(Color online) The same as Fig.2a, but with no damping inside the metal

(γ = 0).

Fig. 3.

(Color online) The zero-order transmission coeﬃcient as a function of the
wavelength of the incident radiation measured in units of the period Dg. The calculation is
curried out for the grating structure characterized by ε = 11.9, Dg = 1.75 µm, a = 0.35µm,
and h = 1.4µm. The solid red and dashed black curves correspond to calculations done,
respectively, with (γ = 0.1eV ) and without (γ = 0) damping inside the metal. The sum of
the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients for γ = 0.1eV is shown as the blue curve. Its
deviation from 1 represents the loss of electromagnetic energy because of the absorption in
metal.

Fig. 4.

(Color online) The electric ﬁeld of the trapped modes inside the grating. The
red and blue colors correspond, respectively, to positive and negative values of the ﬁeld. The
results are presented for the grating with parameters ε = 11.9, Dg = 1.75 µm, a = 0.35µm,
and h = 1.4µm. Each colored strip represents the electric ﬁeld of the corresponding trapped
mode as a function of x and z. The x-range for each strip corresponds to
0.26µm and range for z is speciﬁed in the ﬁgure in units of Dg.

Fig. 5.

(Color online) The zero-order transmission coeﬃcient as a function of the
wavelength of the incident radiation measured in units of the period D0
1.75µm. The
calculation is carried out for the grating structure characterized by ε = 11.9, a = 0.3µm,
h = 0.8µm, and diﬀerent periods Dg. The red curve shows the transmission coeﬃcient
Dg = D0

1.75µm, the blue curve for Dg = D0/1.5, and the black curve for Dg = D0/4.

Tungsten trioxide adopts a variety of structures which can be intercalated with charged species to
alter the electronic properties, thus forming ‘tungsten bronzes’. Similar optical eﬀects are observed
upon removing oxygen from WO3, although the electronic properties are slightly diﬀerent. Here
we present a computational study of cubic and hexagonal alkali bronzes and examine the eﬀects
on cell size and band structure as the size of the intercalated ion is increased. With the exception
of hydrogen (which is predicted to be unstable as an intercalate), the behaviour of the bronzes are
relatively consistent. NaWO3 is the most stable of the cubic systems, although in the hexagonal
system the larger ions are more stable. The band structures are identical, with the intercalated
atom donating its single electron to the tungsten 5d valence band. Next, this was extended to a
study of fractional doping in the NaxWO3 system (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). A linear variation in cell parameter,
and a systematic change in the position of the Fermi level up into the valence band was observed
with increasing x. In the underdoped WO3−x system however, the Fermi level undergoes a sudden
jump into the conduction band at around x = 0.2. Lastly, three compounds of a layered WO4 · α,ω-
diaminoalkane hybrid series were studied and found to be insulating, with features in the band
structure similar to those of the parent WO3 compound which relate well to experimental UV-
visible spectroscopy results.

INTRODUCTION

Tungsten trioxide has long been studied for its interest-
ing structural, electronic, and electrochromic properties.
Tungsten trioxide is most stable in a pseudo-cubic, dis-
torted ReO3 structure [1] but can also form metastable
hexagonal [2], tetragonal [3] and pyrochlore [4, 5] struc-
tures. For all of these structures it is possible to interca-
late mono- or di-valent cations in the vacancies or chan-
nels within the structures to form the so-called ‘tungsten
bronzes’ [3, 6, 7, 8]. The resulting materials exhibit a
continuous colour change [9] and often a large increase
in the electrical conductivity, which becomes metallic in
nature [10]. The most-studied system is that of the cu-
bic alkali bronzes (MxWO3, M = Group I alkali ion, 0
≤ x ≤ 1). Of these, the sodium bronze is the only com-
pound that has been reported with x = 1 [9], however
in the hexagonal system, all alkali ions (Li - Cs) have
been intercalated to varying degrees [1].
In the cubic
system, even low levels of doping (x < 0.2) cause a dra-
matic colour change, which has led to tungsten triox-
ide being used as a material in electrochromic windows
[11, 12, 13]. Bulk superconductivity has been observed at
2-3 K in Na0.2WO3 [14]. In addition to electronic dop-
ing, tungsten trioxide can also exhibit electron-doping
via the removal of oxygen, with similar colouration eﬀects
[15]. However colouration and conduction are not strictly
related, as the conductivity in a thin ﬁlm of oxygen-
deﬁcient WO3
x is much lower than in a thin ﬁlm of
MxWO3 of the same colour [16]. This indicates that the
mechanism for mobility is not simply due to delocalised
electrons or holes, but rather changes in the band struc-
ture near the Fermi level, which are diﬀerent for the two
types of material [16, 17]. Recent work by our group has

−

concentrated on developing organic-inorganic hybrid ma-
terials based on two-dimensional tungsten oxide sheets
(formed by corner-shared WO6 octahedra) linked with
organic diamine molecules [18, 19]. The electronic struc-
ture of these materials will determine how they may
be used in various electronic applications. This work
presents ab initio computations on a variety of tungsten
oxide derivatives, including a series of cubic and hexag-
onal alkali tungsten bronzes, variable doping NaxWO3
(0 ≤ x ≤ 1), oxygen-deﬁcient WO3
x, and some simple
layered organic-inorganic tungsten oxide hybrid struc-
tures to aid in understanding the optical and electronic
properties of the latter. During the course of complet-
ing this work another paper has recently appeared which
treats some of the earlier materials [20].

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

We have applied density functional theory (DFT)
within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
[21] using the VASP package [22, 23, 24, 25] which solves
the DFT-GGA Kohn-Sham equations within the pseu-
dopotential approximation. Here the valence electrons
have been expanded in a plane wave basis set and the
eﬀect of the core on the valence electrons has been mod-
elled with ultrasoft pseudopotentials. We used ultrasoft
Vanderbilt type pseudopotentials [26] as supplied by G.
Kresse and J. Hafner [27]. The pseudopotential valence
states and cut-oﬀ energies for all elements used are given
in Table I.

To study the eﬀect of fractional doping in the NaxWO3
system, we used a supercell method consisting of up to
eight primitive WO3 cells, with between 1-7 of these cells

Similarly for the oxygen-deﬁcient WO3
x system, 3-6
cells were used with one oxygen vacancy in each case.
In all cases the basis vectors of the cell were chosen to
avoid the creation of lines or planes of dopants.

k-point meshes between 4×4×4 and 15×15×15 were
used to relax the various systems, corresponding respec-
tively to 24-36 and 120-455 k-points in the irreducible
Brillouin zone. As a general rule, the simplest bronze
structures with few (1-4) formula units per cell used
ﬁner k-point meshes (more k-points) than the larger non-
x and hybrid structures. In all cases the
metallic WO3
k-point mesh was varied at the end of the relaxation and
the energy was found to converge to better than 10 meV
in all cases. The cell parameters and atomic positions
were allowed to relax in alternate cycles. The atomic
positions were considered relaxed when the total energy
had converged to within 10 meV between ionic steps. In
the calculations of the hybrid structures the relative po-
sitions of the in-plane tungsten and oxygen atoms were
ﬁxed at the origin and half-way along each planar axis,
respectively.

CUBIC AND HEXAGONAL ALKALI BRONZES

Structure

The alkali elements (H, Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) were
each used as the intercalated species in cubic MWO3
(x = 1 bronzes) and hexagonal M0.33WO3 (full inter-
calation of the hexagonal tunnels). In each case the in-
tercalated metal atom was placed in the plane of the
apical oxygen atoms, in the centre of the cavity (Fig-
ure 1). WO3 does not form a perfectly cubic cell at
room temperature, as the WO6 octahedra are slightly
distorted in terms of W−O bond lengths and W−O−W
bond angles, due to antiferroelectric displacement of the
tungsten atoms and subsequent rotation of the WO6 oc-
tahedra [1, 28]. However this is not taken into account in

FIG. 1: The structure of cubic (left) and hexagonal (right)
tungsten oxide and bronzes. The unit cell is indicated in each
case.

the calculated system; the cell always relaxes to a cubic
structure. In calculations involving supercells of tungsten
trioxide the distortions are seen [20]. Tungsten bronzes
on the other hand do form the simple cubic structure at
high intercalation levels [29]. The hexagonal structure,
which was also studied for comparison, is the same for
both the oxide and bronzes. (The term ‘cubic’ is used
connotatively throughout this article of those systems
that are cubic or close to it; as opposed to the hexag-
onal systems also studied.)

Figure 2 shows some experimental results for the cubic
bronze system (obtained from [29, 30, 31, 32]. In the case
of non-cubic WO3 a cubic cell was calculated from the
volume average of the given parameters.) Of all the in-
tercalated alkali elements which have been attempted ex-
perimentally, only sodium is able to form a stable struc-
ture with x = 1 at normal temperatures and pressures.
In general the calculated cell parameters for the cubic
system are larger than the experimental. It is also no-
ticeable that as the size of the intercalated ion increases,
the cell size increases super-linearly. The Goldschmidt
tolerance factor for cubic perovskites can be calculated
from the formula t = rM +rO
[33], where rj are the
√2(rW +RO)
ionic radii. For a perovskite structure to be stable, t must
be less than unity. The tolerance factors for NaWO3 and
KWO3 are 0.909 and 1.056 respectively, indicating that

3

rameter for fully intercalated cubic tungsten bronzes.

the potassium atom is slightly too large to form a sta-
ble structure. Potassium bronzes have been formed with
high x contents, but only under high-pressure synthesis
conditions [32]. Rubidium and caesium cubic bronzes
with high x content cannot be formed. The hexagonal
structure, having larger tunnels, is able to accommodate
larger ions than observed in the cubic system.
In the
experimental system the stability of hydrogen is notori-
ously diﬃcult to maintain, as it is quite mobile due to its
small size. Both hydrogen and lithium are small enough
ions to be able to occupy the small triangular sites be-
tween the hexagonal tunnels [1]. Thus reported experi-
mental results for H+- and Li+-hexagonal bronzes may
show diﬀering behaviour from larger atoms because the
occupied sites may be diﬀerent in each case. In the exper-
imental hexagonal system, the a parameter is observed
to increase as ions are intercalated while the c parame-
ter decreases. The ﬁnal values are relatively consistent
across the series, as given in Table II. These are gener-
ally lower than the calculated values we have obtained,
although most discrepancies are less than 0.5%.

For the hexagonal system, the changes in the lattice
parameters are much less pronounced than in the cubic
system, as shown in Table III. This is due to the hexag-
onal tunnel spaces being much larger than the cavities
in the cubic system and so the interactions between the
inserted ion and the WO3 lattice are smaller.

Charge density

Charge density plots of the cubic system taken in a
plane through the centre of the cell where the interca-
lated atom sits, reveal that hydrogen behaves diﬀerently
from the other intercalates. This is shown in Figure 3.
Bearing in mind that the charge density plots consider

FIG. 3: Charge density maps of cubic (top) and hexagonal
(bottom) tungsten oxide and bronzes. The largest tunnels are
indicated, which are completely ﬁlled in each case. The oxy-
gen atoms in-plane with the intercalated atom can be clearly
seen, and only in the case of hydrogen is the charge still as-
sociated with the intercalated atom.

only the valence electrons, the fact that we observe some
charge on the hydrogen atom but not on any of the oth-
ers indicates that hydrogen is not ionised. That larger
atoms are completely ionised is consistent with other re-
ported experimental results [28]. It is interesting that the
same phenomenon occurs in both the cubic and hexago-
nal cases. The ﬁrst ionisation energy of the intercalates
are as follows: hydrogen 1.318 eV, lithium 0.526 eV,
sodium 0.502 eV, potassium 0.425 eV, rubidium 0.409
eV, caesium 0.382 eV [34]. The high ionisation energy of
hydrogen with respect to the other intercalates may be
responsible for the diﬀering behaviour.

Energies of formation

The energies of formation of the cubic and hexagonal
tungsten bronzes are shown in Table IV and Figure 4.
These are calculated by subtracting the ground state en-
ergies of the components (WO3 plus the metal cation)
from the ground state energy of the ﬁnal product (tung-
sten bronze). A negative energy of formation therefore
indicates that the compound formed is stable.

Firstly, a comparison of cubic and hexagonal WO3
shows that the hexagonal phase has a very similar energy
to the cubic phase. Literature results indicate that the
cubic phase is preferred, although the hexagonal phase is
stable up to temperatures of 400-500oC, indicating that
the phase transition has a high activation energy [1, 2].
In both the cubic and hexagonal systems, the hydrogen-

experimental system the hydrogen bronzes are easily ox-
idised as the protons are highly mobile [31, 35]. This
result also relates to hydrogen being the only intercalate

calates. This point coincides with the stability predicted
by the Goldschmidt perovskite tolerance factor. For the
stable compounds (WO3, LiWO3, and NaWO3) there is
a progressive decrease in the energy of formation. This
supports experimental evidence that sodium may well be
the most stable of the cubic bronzes, as it is the only
one for which a fully intercalated compound has been
reported [35].

Density of states

For both the cubic and hexagonal systems other than
hydrogen, the basic band structures of the bronzes are es-
sentially identical to the parent oxide of the same phase.
The only diﬀerence amongst them is the position of the
Fermi level relative to the valence and conduction bands,
which will be discussed later. Hence comparing the band
structure of hexagonal and cubic WO3 will aid a great
deal in describing the bronze systems. A comparison of
the density of states for cubic and hexagonal WO3 is
shown in Figures 5 and 6. The lowest band, situated at
-18 to -16 eV, corresponds to the oxygen 2s orbitals. This
band is present in all of the tungsten-oxide-based systems
studied to date and always occurs at the same energy re-
gardless of the structure or the presence of intercalated
atoms or molecules.

The broad valence band, from -7 to 0 eV, is comprised
mainly of oxygen 2p orbitals. There is a small tungsten

that does not ionise in the bronze structures, as evidenced
by the charge density plots earlier. For the hexagonal
bronzes (apart from hydrogen) there is a steady down-
ward trend in the energy of formation as the size of the
intercalated alkali metal ion increases. Therefore the
larger ions form more stable bronzes than the smaller
ones, which is also indicated in the literature [3]. In the
cubic system however, the energy drops to a point and
then, beyond Na, increases in the case of the larger inter-

5d component but this is negligible above -2 eV. The
valence band cut-oﬀ is sharp at 0 eV and coincides in
both the cubic and hexagonal case with the Fermi level,
rendering the oxide materials semiconducting. The con-
duction band, detailed in Figure 8, lies from 0.5 to 5 eV
in both the cubic and hexagonal cases. In the cubic case
it is solely comprised of tungsten 5d orbitals; however in
the hexagonal case there is also some additional oxygen
2p contribution - particularly to the strong peak feature
observed at 2.5 eV. The band gap (deﬁned as the dif-
ference in energy between the top of the valence band
and the bottom of the conduction band) is 0.4 eV in
the cubic system and 0.5 eV in the hexagonal. This is
much less than the observed band gap, which is typically
reported in the range of 2.5 - 3 eV, and as being indi-
rect [12, 36, 37]. However this is not too surprising as
DFT generally underestimates band gaps. The presence
of peak features in the density of states can also lead to
the phenomenon where even though the conduction band
is being ﬁlled, there is a sudden increase in the popula-
tion of the conduction band at these peaks and a sharp
transition in the optical spectrum is observed.

It is worth taking pause here to point out the similar-
ities between this work and that of experimental results
and other calculations reported on the same structures.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the
valence band is comprised of oxygen 2p states only, and
the conduction band of tungsten 5d states [12, 38]. The
oxygen 2s state at ∼ -20 eV has also been observed by
XPS [39] although, given the precision of the measure-
ment, this band is broadened out and appears to extend
into the oxygen 2p valence band, the distinction of which
is not made by the authors. Calculations using the local-
density approximation and full-potential linear muﬃn-tin
orbitals (where all electrons are considered, not just the
valence electrons as in the case of the VASP program) re-
sult in density of states spectra which are virtually iden-
tical to those we have obtained [40, 41]. This is the case
in both the cubic and hexagonal systems. An older pa-
per by D.W. Bullet [28], utilising a non-relativistic atomic
orbital-based method shows a very similar band structure

hexagonal (b) WO3.

and hexagonal (b) WO3, from ﬁgure 5.

(oxygen 2p as valence band and tungsten 5d as conduc-
tion band).

Figure 7 shows a comparison of the density of states of
the cubic bronzes with the parent oxide. The hydrogen
bronze system shows a large peak feature at the bottom
of the conduction band, which is attributed to the non-
ionised hydrogen 1s orbital. Because only one electron is
contributed from the hydrogen, the Fermi level lies about
in the middle of this sub-band. For the other bronze sys-
tems, analysis of the density of states contribution from
each atom reveals that the intercalated atom contributes
very little if at all to the overall density of states. This
is expected due to its complete ionisation, as the single
valence electron of the intercalated atom is contributed
to the W−O framework [28]. All compounds have the
Fermi level located well into the conduction band, ren-
dering them metallic. The shape of the band structure
does not change as atoms are intercalated. This is also
noted in other literature [40, 41]. Also, the magnitude
of the band gap and the position of the Fermi level is
relatively constant - even for those compounds which are
known to be unstable (cubic potassium, rubidium and
caesium bronzes).

We have also derived the band structure curves along
lines of symmetry in cubic WO3 and cubic NaWO3.
These are given in Figure 8. These results agree ex-
tremely well with the calculated band structures of both
[41], considering that dif-
Bullett [28] and Cora et. al.
ferent methods were used for each calculation. We again
notice the high degree of similarity between the parent
oxide and the sodium bronze, with the only major diﬀer-
ence being the position of the Fermi level.

CUBIC SODIUM TUNGSTEN BRONZE SERIES

Following the work comparing cubic and hexagonal
tungsten bronzes, we set out to explore the sodium
bronze system more thoroughly. Experimentally it is
quite diﬃcult to obtain a completely saturated sodium
tungsten bronze (i.e. x = 1), and even when an excess
of sodium tungstate is used in the reaction 3x·Na2WO4
+ (6 − 4x)WO3 + x·W → 6NaxWO3, it is not a given
that the resulting bronze will have x = 1 [29]. There is a
raft of experimental results, however, on sodium bronzes
with x < 1 (refs. [3, 9, 10, 29, 42], to name but a few), all
illustrating that x is a continuous quantity and not con-
ﬁned to any series of exactly stoichiometric compounds.
In addition to x = 0 and 1, which were performed as
part of the cubic tungsten oxide and alkali bronze series,
we have calculated the structure and density of states
for x = n
8 ; n = 1 − 8. The average cubic cell parameter
was found to increase linearly with x as shown in ﬁgure
9. Also shown in this ﬁgure is a series of reported ex-
perimental results. For higher x contents the two data
sets are very close, with the calculated parameters be-

ing about 0.8% larger than the experimental; again, a
good result given the approximations made using this
method. However below x = 0.3, the experimental re-
sults diﬀer markedly from the calculated values, due to a
phase change to a tetragonal form at low x values in the
experimental system [43]. The structure of the tetrago-
nal phase is not related to the cubic phase [3]. It contains
seven WO3 units per cell (28 atoms), and when one takes
the fractional doping into account, the resulting system
quickly becomes much too large to attempt a calculation
with the computational resources available to us. In the
[20] the volume versus x
work of Walkingshaw et. al.
deviates from this linear behaviour for x as large as 0.5.
There are no obvious changes in the appearance of the
density of states as x increases from zero to one. The na-
ture of the band structure near the Fermi level is shown
in ﬁgure 10. The band gap increases linearly with x,
while the Fermi level quickly moves into the conduction
band. According to this plot we would expect to see a
semiconductor-metal transition at about x = 0.06, where
the Fermi level moves into the conduction band. How-

ever, in the experimental system this transition is ob-
served at x = 0.3, corresponding to (and perhaps inﬂu-
enced by) the structural transition ([3], and references
therein).

Once again, analysis of the individual atomic contribu-
tions to the density of states indicates that each sodium
atom is fully ionised, and the electron donated to the
tungsten 5d conduction band [28].

SUB-STOICHIOMETRIC WO3−x SERIES

−

As a complement to the sodium bronze series, sub-
stoichiometric WO3
x was examined for compounds with
x ranging from zero to 0.33. In the experimental system,
the maximum oxygen loss that can be achieved without
a drastic phase change is ∼ 0.35 ([44], and references
therein). There are a number of diﬀerent stoichiometric
formulae for compounds in the range WO2.65 - WO3, and
for some of these the crystal structure has been solved.
They are given the names α-, β- and γ-phase, as shown
in Table V with their respective formulae. The crystal
structures of the β- and γ-phases were solved by Magneli
[45, 46]. Booth et al. generalise the β-phase even fur-

ther by describing the existence of crystallographic shear
planes [47]. This can account for the broad range of com-
positional formulae. While we are unable to calculate the
properties of these phases as described in literature due
to the restriction on the number of atoms in the system,
we are able to observe the eﬀect that removal of oxygen
has on the simple cubic WO3 phase.

As one might expect, removing oxygen from a site
causes a local distortion of atoms around the vacancy,
and the cell ceases to be simple orthorhombic. The cell
volume changes; initially there is a slight increase at low
deﬁciencies, followed by a decrease. These results are
shown in Figure 11 and are in good agreement with
experimental values, despite the absence of the phase
change in the calculated system.

The energies of formation for the diﬀerent species stud-

ied are given in Table VI. We note that a slight deﬁcit
of oxygen (x = 1
6 ) is more favourable energetically than
stoichiometric WO3. This is observed experimentally, as
commercial WO3 powder exhibits a loss of oxygen over 1-
2 days in atmospheric conditions. Further loss of oxygen
renders WO3
x less energetically favourable than its par-
ent oxide, and once again, as was the case with sodium
tungsten bronzes, the presence of a phase change in the
experimental system may explain any discrepancies seen.

−

It is also of interest to look at the changes in the density
of states as oxygen is removed from WO3. As mentioned
in the introduction, oxygen-deﬁcient WO3 exhibits an in-
creased conductivity, but not as great as that due solely
to the presence of doped electrons. Figure 12 shows the
density of states for the WO3
x system in the region near
−
the Fermi level. The overall spectra share the same fea-
tures previously detailed for WO3: the oxygen 2s band
near -18 eV; the broad valence band, comprised mainly of
oxygen 2p orbitals, from -7 to 0 eV; and the conduction
band, consisting solely of tungsten 5d orbitals, lying from
roughly 0.5 to 5 eV. Naturally the sub-stoichiometric sys-
tems appear more ‘jagged’ than the parent WO3 com-
pound, due in part to the breaking of symmetry, render-
ing each atom non-equivalent to others within the cell,
and causing its contribution to be slightly diﬀerent.

The inset of Figure 12 shows the progression of the
Fermi level into the conduction band. There is a sharp
jump between x = 0.167 and 0.2 as the Fermi level moves
up into the conduction band - not a gradual transition
as in the case of the sodium bronzes NaxWO3. While
the x = 0.167 compound has the Fermi level at zero (and
therefore, still non-conducting), the band structure of the
valence band is similar to that of the conducting species.
It appears that there is a decrease in the density of states
in the valence band, followed by the Fermi level being
pushed up into the conduction band. The stoichiometry

ORGANIC-INORGANIC LAYERED HYBRIDS

Following on from the background studies of tungsten
bronzes and the oxygen-deﬁcient tungsten oxides, layered
organic-inorganic hybrid compounds were studied. These
structures consist of WO4 layers (as in H2WO4 [48]), con-
nected via aliphatic (linear) alkyl diamines. These have
been investigated experimentally by us elsewhere [18].
Three diﬀerent length alkyl amines were used in the cal-
culations, with two, four and six carbons. The input
structure of the hybrid systems is the most conceptu-
ally simple: a single unit formula, WO4·H3N(CH2)nNH3
(n = 2, 4, 6 - hereby abbreviated to W-DAn). It is highly
conceivable that the calculated structure of the hybrid
compounds is in a slightly higher energy state than that
of the actual structure, which may be a supercell of the
simple input case, with possible tilts and rotations of the
octahedra and organic molecules. As mentioned, WO3
does not form a simple cubic structure, but exhibits small
distortions of bond lengths and angles which render it
very slightly oﬀ-cubic, with eight formula units per cell.
In extending the computations to the organic-inorganic
systems then, several constraints were necessary. Firstly
only one cell was used, which may aﬀect the outcome
not only due to the removal of distortion in the inorganic
layer (which apparently lowers the energy in the oxide
and hydrate compounds) but also because this does not
allow for the diﬀering orientation of the organic molecules
in neighbouring cells. Secondly, constraints were placed
on the inorganic atoms in order to maintain the position
of the layer. This entailed ﬁxing the position of the tung-
sten and planar oxygen atoms at the corner and edges
of the cell respectively. This was suﬃcient to relax the
atoms to a sensible structure.

These compounds are isomorphic with diaminoalkane
metal halides which have been investigated by Mitzi [49].
There, two schemes were identiﬁed for the bonding of the
organic ammonium group to the inorganic layer, desig-

nated ‘bridging’ and ‘terminal’ (which we shall call ’api-
cal’). In the ‘bridging’ case the organic ammonium forms
hydrogen bonds to two bridging and one apical atom (in
the work of Mitzi, this is a halogen atom; in our work,
oxygen) while in the ‘apical’ case hydrogen bonds are
formed to two apical and one bridging atom (Figure 13).
This causes the alkyl chain to lie diagonally within the
cell when the ammonium group is in a bridging conﬁgu-
ration, but parallel for the apical. When the alkyl chain
is longer than one carbon (methylamine), the second car-
bon in the chain would be too close to the opposing apical
(oxygen) atom if a bridging conformation were adopted.
Thus in general, apical bonding is observed for organic-
inorganic systems with organic chain lengths of two or
more carbon atoms.

Given this, calculations were initially performed on the
methylamine system in both the bridging and apical con-
ﬁgurations, to compare the energies of each and as a
starting point to construct the initial cells for the com-
putations of the longer chain diamine hybrids. Figure 14
shows the calculated relaxed structures of one methylam-
monium ion with respect to the tungsten oxide layer. In

as W-DA4 is harder to form than both W-DA2 and W-
DA6.

The density of states of the three compounds are all
very similar. The results are shown in Figure 16. The
main features are as follows: As in the tungsten oxide and
tungsten bronze systems, the oxygen 2s band is located
between -18 and -16 eV. There is a splitting between the
planar and apical oxygen contributions, with the planar
oxygen bands being broader and lying at slightly lower
energies. The nitrogen 2s bands lie at about -18.5 eV and
the carbon 2s bands lie between -16 and -9 eV. The ap-
pearance of multiple carbon s bands in the longer chain
systems is due to the diﬀerent environments in which the
carbon atoms are located along the length of the chain.
Between -9 and 0 eV lie the 2p bands of N (lowest), C
(middle) and O (highest). The hydrogen atoms associ-
ated with the carbon and nitrogen atoms contribute their
single 1s electrons to the bands of their respective atoms.
The oxygen band, from -2 to 0 eV, closely resembles
that of the tungsten oxides and bronzes. There is rela-

(left) and apical (right) conﬁgurations.

both cases the calculated structure closely resembles that
expected from the diagram in Figure 13. In the apical
case the shortest hydrogen bonds between the ammonium
hydrogen atoms and the oxygen atoms of the inorganic
layer are as expected: two short hydrogen bonds to two
apical oxygens and one to the opposing bridging oxygen.
However, for the bridging case the two hydrogens that
were expected to interact with adjacent bridging oxy-
gens are actually closer to apical oxygens. In this latter
case the tilting of the organic molecule is much less than
for the apical case, and overall it appears that there is
a more delocalised attraction between the hydrogen and
oxygen atoms.

The energies of the two systems were calculated to be
-123.31 eV for the apical case and -123.08 eV for the
bridging. Thus the apical conﬁguration appears to be
more stable, both from its lower energy and examination
of the structure with more localised forces. Each of the
two methylamine structures were used as a basis for the
initial positions of the diaminoethane (DA2) compound.
The relaxed cell parameters are given in Table VII. In
the apical case the cell volume is slightly less than in the
bridging case. Despite the greater tilting expected for the
terminal structure, the planar axes (a and c) are shorter
and the interlayer spacing b is longer than for the bridg-
ing. The two structures are shown in Figure 15. As for
the methylammonium structures, in the bridging confor-
mation there are several longer bond distances from each
hydrogen to the oxygen atoms, whereas in the apical con-
formation for each hydrogen there is a single bond that
is distinctly shorter to one oxygen than the others.

The energies of these two structures are calculated
to be −114.709 eV for the bridging conformation and
−115.750 eV for the apical. The apical conformation
is therefore more stable, and the diﬀerence between the
two is greater than for the methylammonium case. Two
other systems were extended from the apical W-DA2:
W-DA4 (4-carbon chain) and W-DA6 (6-carbon chain).
Again the planar tungsten and oxygen atom positions
were ﬁxed. The energies of formation are given in Table
VIII. As can be seen from the negative values, all three
compounds are stable, with W-DA4 being the least stable
of the three. This seems to be conﬁrmed experimentally

tively little organic or tungsten component to this band,
so once again the valence band is comprised of oxygen 2p
orbitals. The conduction band begins at around 0.4 eV
but the density of states is very low up to a peak feature
at about 2.7 eV. There is also a second peak feature at
4.0 eV. This band is comprised mostly of tungsten 5d
orbitals, as in the tungsten oxides and bronzes, but in
these hybrid compounds there is an additional oxygen 2p
component to this band. The apical oxygen atom con-
tributes to the ﬁrst peak feature and the planar oxygen
atoms contribute to the second. Above 4.5 eV lie the
organic anti-bonding orbitals. The band structure in the
vicinity of the Fermi level (i.e. valence and conduction
bands) is virtually identical for the three diﬀerent organic
intercalates. As expected the organic molecule does not
participate in electronic conduction and the compound
is an insulator. Features in the calculated band struc-
ture relate very closely to the band gap as determined
by UV-visible spectroscopy [50]. Powder spectra of the
hybrids indicate a shift in the absorption edge from 2.6-
2.8 eV for WO3 to 4.1 eV for the hybrids [18]. There

likely that the features in the UV-visible powder spectra
correspond to indirect band gaps, which are displayed in
the calculated density of states spectra as peak features
in the valence band, where the occupancy of the band
suddenly increases.

SUMMARY

A number of tungsten oxide-based systems have been
studied using ab initio computation techniques. Hexag-

onal and cubic alkali tungsten bronzes exhibit trends in
cell sizes which agree well with experimental data. The
band structure and charge density plots of these show
that the intercalated alkali atom (with the exception of
hydrogen) donates its electron to the conduction band.
An in-depth study of the partially doped cubic sodium
bronze system showed the progressive movement of the
Fermi level into the conduction band. However it is
suspected that in the experimental system the onset of
metallic conductivity is associated with or induced by a
phase change not accounted for in these calculations. A
transition to a conducting state is also observed exper-
imentally in oxygen-deﬁcient tungsten trioxide. This is
modelled well by the calculations, as are the changing cell
dimensions. The free energy indicates that a slight deﬁcit
of oxygen renders tungsten trioxide more stable than the
exactly stoichiometric form, which is also observed exper-
imentally. Lastly three tungsten-oxide/organic hybrids
with simple α,ω-diaminoalkane molecules were studied.
They are energetically stable and exhibit many similar-
ities in the band structure to that of the parent cubic
tungsten trioxide. The amines are protonated to form
ammonium groups and the undoped diammoniumalkane
hybrids are calculated to be electrically insulating.

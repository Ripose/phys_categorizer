1 Abstract

It is shown how various ideas that are well established for the solution of Poisson’s equation
using plane waves, Fast Multipole and Multigrid methods can be incorporated into the
wavelet context. The combination of wavelet concepts and multigrid techniques turns
out to be particularly fruitful. We propose a new multigrid V cycle scheme that is not
only much simpler, but also more eﬃcient than the standard V cycle. Whereas in the
traditional V cycle the residue is passed to the coarser grid levels, this new scheme does
not require the calculation of a residue. Instead it works with copies of the charge density
on the diﬀerent grid levels that were obtained from the underlying charge density on the
ﬁnest grid by wavelet transformations. This scheme is not limited to the pure wavelet
setting, where it is faster than the preconditiooned conjugate gradient method, but equally
well applicable for ﬁnite diﬀerence discretizations of Poisson’s equation.

2 Introduction

Poisson’s equation

is the basic equation for electrostatic problems. As such it plays an important role in
a large variety of scientiﬁc and technological problems. The solution of the diﬀerential
equation Eq. 1 can be written as an integral equation

Gravitational problems are based on exactly the same equations as the electrostatic prob-
lem, but we will use in this article the language of electrostatics, i.e. we will refer to ρ(r) as
a charge density. The most eﬃcient numerical approaches for the solution of electrostatic
problems are based on Eq /refpoisson rather than Eq. /reﬁnteq. However preconditioning
steps found in these methods can be considered as approximate solutions of Eq. /reﬁnteq.
The fact that the Green’s function
|r−r′| is of long range makes the numerical solution
of Poisson’s equation diﬃcult, since it implies that a charge density at a point r′ will
have an non-negligible inﬂuence on the potential V (r) at a point r far away. A naive
implementation of Eq. 2 would therefore have a quadratic scaling. It comes however to
our help, that the potential arising from a charge distribution far away is slowly varying
and does not depend on the details of the charge distribution. All eﬃcient algorithms for

solving electrostatic problems are therefore based on a hierarchical multiscale treatment.
On the short length scales the rapid variations of the potential due to the exact charge
distribution of close by sources of charge are treated, on the large length scales the slow
variation due to some smoothed charge distribution of far sources is accounted for. Since
the number of degrees of freedom decreases rapidly with increasing length scales, one can
obtain algorithms with linear or nearly linear scaling. In the following, we will brieﬂy
summarize how this hierarchical treatment is implemented in the standard algorithms

The Fourier analysis of the real space charge density necessary to obtain its Fourier
components ρK and the synthesis of the potential in real space from its Fourier
components given by Eq. 3 can be done with Fast Fourier methods at a cost of
N log2(N) where N is the number of grid points.

•

Fast Multipole methods (FMM):
The Fast Multipole method [1] allows us to calculate the potentials and the forces of
a discrete system of charged point particles with linear or nearly linear scaling. It can
thus be considered as the solution of Poisson’s equation for a charge density that is
a sum of delta functions centered at the positions of the particles. The potential and
forces have to be evaluated only at the position of the particles. In this method both
the charge density and the potential are coarse grained and only these coarse grained
quantities are interacting over long distances. The coarse grained quantities are large
in spatial extent and have less details, i.e they are smoothed versions of the original
charge density. The coarse graining is done recursively, leading to a hierarchy of
coarse grained quantities. The spatial extent of these coarse grained quantities at
the various levels of the hierarchy and the minimum interaction distance, for which
this approximate interaction is considered to be exact, are proportional. The coarse
graining is done by a multipole expansion. The Fast Multipole method can also
easily be generalized to continuous charge distributions that are sums of Gaussian
charge distributions [4].

•

Multigrid methods (MG):
Trying to solve Poisson’s equation by any relaxation or iterative method (such as
conjugate gradient) on the ﬁne grid on which one ﬁnally wants to have the solution
leads to a number of iterations that increases strongly with the size of the grid. The
reason for this is that on a grid with a given spacing h one can eﬃciently treat Fourier

2

components with a wavelength λ = 2π
K that is comparable to the the grid spacing h,
but the longer wavelength Fourier components converge very slowly. This increase in
the number of iterations prevents a straightforward linear scaling solution of Eq. 1.
In the multigrid method, pioneered by A. Brandt [5], one is therefore introducing a
hierarchy of grids with a grid spacing that is increasing by a factor of two on each
hierarchic level. In contrast to the Fourier and FMM methods where the charge and
the potential are directly decomposed into components characterized by a certain
length scale, it is the residue that is passed from the ﬁne grids to the coarse grids
in the MG method. The residue corresponds to the charge that would give rise to
a potential that is the diﬀerence between the exact potential and the approximate
potential at the current stage of the iteration.

In the following we will now show that all the three above mentioned approaches ﬁt

quite naturally into the framework of wavelet multiresolution analysis.

Within wavelet theory [18] one has two possible representations of a function f (x), a

scaling function representation

and a wavelet representation.

In contrast to the scaling function representation, the wavelet representation is a hierarchic
representation. The wavelet at the hierarchic level k is related to the mother wavelet ψ
by

The characteristic length scale of a wavelet at resolution level k is therefore proportional
to 2−k. A wavelet on a certain level k is a linear combination of scaling functions at the
higher resolution level k + 1

Scaling functions at adjacent resolution levels are related by a similar reﬁnement relation

and hence also any wavelet at a resolution level k is a linear combination of the highest
resolution scaling functions. The so-called fast wavelet transform allows us to transform
back and forth between a scaling function and a wavelet representation.

within the chosen discretization scheme. This is due to the fact that the wavelets are not
perfectly localized in Fourier space, i.e. many frequencies are necessary to synthesize a
wavelet. However the amplitude of all these frequencies is clearly peaked at a nonzero
characteristic frequency for any wavelet with at least one vanishing moment. From the
scaling property (Eq. 6) it follows, that the frequency at which the peak occurs changes
by a factor of two on neighboring resolution grids. This suggest that the coupling between
the diﬀerent resolution levels is weak.

In the preeceding paragraph we presented the mathematical framework only for the
one-dimensional case. The generalization to the 3-dim case is straightforward by using
tensor products [18]. Also in the rest of the paper only the one-dimensional form of
the mathematical formulas will presented for reasons of simplicity. It has to be stressed
however that all the numerical results were obtained for the three-dimensional case.

3 The Fourier approach for wavelets

Preconditioning by the diagonal is the simplest preconditioning method. Unfortunately
it does not work in most basis sets such as ﬁnite elements. Scaling function basis sets
are no exception to this rule.
It can however be applied if the Laplacian is expressed
in a wavelet basis set [19]. Preconditioned conjugate gradient type methods are then a
possible method for the solution of Poissons equation expressed in diﬀerential form (Eq.1).
As discussed above we expect the coupling between diﬀerent resolution levels to be weak.
Within one resolution level the amplitude of the matrix elements should decay rapidly
with distance as soon as the wavelet basis functions are not any more overlapping since
they represent the interaction of a dipole or higher multipole with other multipoles of the
same type. For overlapping basis functions the oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements within one
block corresponding to one resolution level are presumably not much smaller than the
diagonal ones. Nevertheless they are neglected in the current precondition schemes. This
neglect is probably the main reason for their relatively slow convergence. The multigrid
methods to be discussed later include also in an approximative way through Gauss-Seidel
relaxations this oﬀ-diagonal coupling within each block.

The matrix elements of the Laplacian in a wavelet basis can be calculated analyti-
cally [15]. From the scaling relation (Eq. 6) it follows that they increase by a factor of 4
on each consecutive ﬁner resolution level.

˜V (r) is the approximate solution at a certain iteration of the solution process. The
preconditioned residue ∆V is then used to update the approximate potential ˜V . In the
case of a preconditioned steepest descent this update would simply read

∇

(14)

˜V

←

where α is an appropriate step size.

In the 3-dimensional case, the preconditioning is slightly more complicated than in the
one dimensional case of Eq. 13. In the 3-dimensional case the diagonal elements of the
Laplacian are diﬀerent for wavelets that are pure products of one-dimensional wavelets or
that are products of scaling functions and wavelets. Hence the constant const in Eq. 13,
that represents the inverse of the diagonal elements of this type of wavelet, is diﬀerent for
the diﬀerent wavelets that can be formed in the three-dimensional case.

In the following we will present some numerical results for the solution of the 3-
dimensional Poisson equation in a wavelet basis using the Fourier approach. All the
methods presented in this paper will have the property that the convergence rate is
independent of the grid size. We have chosen 643 grids for all the numerical examples.
The fact that the number of iterations necessary to reach a certain target accuracy is
independent of the system size together with the fact that a single iteration involves a
cost that is linear with respect to the number of grid points ensures that the Poisson’s
equation can be solved with overall linear scaling. Whereas we use here only simple
equidistant grids, this linear scaling has already been demonstrated with highly adaptive
grids in problems that involve many diﬀerent length scales [6, 7, 8, 9]

Fig. 1 shows numerical results for several wavelet families. The slow convergence of
the interpolating wavelets is due to the fact that they have a non-vanishing average and
therefore a non-vanishing zero Fourier component [7]. Hence they are all localized in
Fourier space at the origin instead of being localized around a non-zero frequency. This
deﬁciency can be eliminated by lifting. The Fourier power spectrum of the lifted wavelets
tends to zero at the origin with zero slope for the family with two vanishing moments
considered here. The higher 8-th order lifted interpolating wavelet is smoother than its
6-th order counterpart and hence better localized in the high frequency part. This leads
to a slightly faster convergence.

lating and lifted interpolating wavelets.

Combining the diagonal preconditioning (Eq. 13) with a conjugate gradient minimiza-
tion instead of a steepest descent minimization gives a signiﬁcantly faster convergence.
The number of iterations can nearly be cut into half for the cases examined above with
the steepest descent method.

Up to now we have only considered the case where the elements of the matrix repre-
senting the Laplacian were calculated within the same wavelet family that was used to
analyze the residue by wavelet transformations to do the preconditioning step. More gen-
eral schemes can however be implemented. It is not even necessary that the calculation
of the Laplacian matrix elements is done in a wavelet basis. One can instead use simple
second order ﬁnite diﬀerences, which in the one-dimensional case are given by

or some higher order ﬁnite diﬀerences for the calculation of the matrix elements. The
scaling relation Eq. 12 does not any more hold exactly, but it is fulﬁlled approximately
and the schemes works as well or even better than in the pure wavelet case as is shown
in Fig. 2.

4 The FMM approach for wavelets

In the Fourier approach we used an approximate diagonal inverse in the standard rep-
resentation for preconditioning. We postulated that this is a good approximate inverse
because the coupling between diﬀerent wavelets and in particular between wavelets on
diﬀerent resolution levels should be small. There is another operator representation, the
non-standard form[16, 11], where the coupling between the diﬀerent levels is not contained
in the operator representation but hidden in the redundant data representation that is

required for its application. This non-standard form might of course also be used to repre-
sent an approximate inverse for preconditioning purposes. The non-standard form would
have the advantage that we would get an indirect coupling between diﬀerent levels k even
though we do not have to include it in the matrix representation for the approximate
|r−r′| the coupling at one res-
inverse. Since the inverse represents the Green’s function
olution level will decay rapidly for the following reasons. On one level k we do not have
any coupling in the non-standard representation between scaling functions and scaling
functions, but only between scaling functions with wavelets and wavelets with wavelets.
The wavelets have in general several vanishing moments, which means that the electro-
static potentials arising from a wavelet charge distribution decays rapidly (e.g.
like an
octopole). Hence the matrix elements in the non-standard representation decay rapidly
away from the diagonal for each of the 3 non-zero blocks.

1

Let us now point out the similarities between using the non-standard form of the
Green’s function and the FMM method. Both in the non-standard operator form and
in the FMM method successively coarse grained quantities of the charge density are cal-
culated. In the FMM method this is done by calculating multipoles of charge densities
formed by particles extending over larger and larger regions, in the non-standard oper-
ator form this is done by applying the fast wavelet transform to obtain the redundant
representation of the charge density. The representation is redundant since it contains
at each resolution level both the wavelet and scaling function coeﬃcients. Both in the
non-standard operator form and the FMM method the interactions are then calculated for
these redundant quantities. The ﬁnal step in both methods consists then of calculating
the potential in a non-redundant form. In the non-standard operator form this is again
done with the help of the fast wavelet transform, in the FMM method again by multipole
techniques.

The fast decay of the coupling postulated above sets in only if the basis functions enter-

ing into the integral for the matrix element are non-overlapping. In the three-dimensional
setting, we are mainly interested in, the number of matrix elements that involve overlap-
ping basis functions is substantial. This comes from the fact that the Green’s function
|r−r′| is in contrast to the Laplacian not separable. The number of signiﬁcant matrix
elements is consequently proportional to a three-dimensional volume of a certain radius
Rc and not to three times a one-dimensional volume of the same length Rc. For these
reasons we have not numerically implemented this approach.

5 The MG approach for wavelets

The aim of this part of the article is twofold. One aspect is how to speed up the con-
vergence of the solution process for Poisson’s equation expressed in a wavelet basis set
compared to the Fourier approach. The other, and more important, aspect is how to ac-
celerate multigrid schemes by incorporating wavelet concepts. The part therefore begins
with a brief review of the multigrid method.

Fig. 3 schematically shows the algorithm of a standard multigrid V cycle [2, 3]. Even
though the scheme is valid in any dimension, a two dimensional setting is suggested by
the ﬁgure, since the data are represented as squares. Since less data are available on the
coarse grids, the squares holding the coarse grid data are increasingly smaller. The upper
half of the ﬁgure shows the ﬁrst part of the V cycle where one goes from the ﬁnest grid
to the coarsest grid and the lower half the second part where one goes back to the ﬁnest
grid.

In the ﬁrst part of the V cycle the potential on all hierarchic grids is improved by
a standard red-black Gauss-Seidel relaxation denoted by GS. The GS relaxation reduces
the error of wavelengths λ that are comparable to the grid spacing h very eﬃciently. In
the 3-dimensional case we are considering here, the smoothing factor is .445 (page 74
of ref [2]). Since we use 2 GS relaxations roughly one quarter of the error around the
wavelength h survives the relaxations on each level. As a consequence the residue ∆ρ
contains mainly longer wavelengths which then in turn are again eﬃciently eliminated
by the GS relaxations on the coarser grids. Nevertheless, the remaining quarter of the
shorter wavelengths surviving the relaxations on the ﬁner grid pollutes the residue on the
coarser grid through aliasing eﬀects. Additional pollution is introduced by the restriction
operation. Additional means that even if the residue on the ﬁner grid would contain only
a wavelength h the restricted quantity would not be identically zero.

In the second part of the V cycle the solutions obtained by relaxation on the coarse
grid are prolongated to the ﬁne grids and added to the existing solutions on each level.
Aliasing pollution is again present in the prolongation procedure. Due to the accumulated
aliasing errors 2 GS relaxations are again done on each level before proceeding to the next
ﬁner level.

To a ﬁrst approximation the diﬀerent representations of ρ at the top of Fig. 3 represent
Fourier ﬁltered version of the real space data set ρ on the ﬁnest grid. The large data set
contains all the Fourier components, while the smaller data sets contain only lower and
lower frequency parts of ρ. Because of the various aliasing errors described above the
Fourier decomposition is however not perfect. Obviously it would be desirable to make

8

this Fourier decomposition as perfect as possible. Then the GS relaxations would not
have to deal with any Fourier components arising from aliasing errors.

of the data sets. The numbering in parentheses gives the ordering of the diﬀerent steps
of the algorithm.

To establish the relation between multigrid and wavelet theory let us ﬁrst note that
the injection scheme for the restriction corresponds to a wavelet analysis step (Eq. 26
of ref. [11]), whereas the standard linear prolongation corresponds to a wavelet synthesis
step (formula 27 of ref. [11]) where all the detail or diﬀerence coeﬃcients d are set to zero.

For vanishing d coeﬃcients, the wavelet analysis step is given by

which is the standard injection and interpolation. As a consequence of the fact that it
can be considered as a wavelet forward and backward transformation, the combination of
injection and interpolation has the appealing property that applying a restriction onto a

This scheme has the advantage that it conserves averages. Applying it to a charge density
thus ensures that the total charge is the same on any grid level. Trying to put the
full weightening scheme into the wavelet theory framework gives a ﬁlter ˜h with nonzero
values of ˜h−1 = 1
4 This ﬁlter ˜h does not satisfy the orthogonality
relations of wavelet theory (formula 8 of ref. [11]) with the h ﬁlter corresponding to linear
interpolation. Hence a prolongation followed by a restriction does not give the identity.

4 , ˜h0 = 1

2, ˜h1 = 1

A pair of restriction and prolongation operators that conserve averages can however
also be derived from wavelet theory. Instead of using interpolating wavelets we have to use
lifted interpolating wavelets [13, 12]. In this way we can obtain both properties, average
conservation and the identity for a prolongation restriction sequence. Using the ﬁlters
derived in ref. [11] we obtain

The right panel of Fig. 4 shows the convergence rate of a sequence of V cycles for
the full weightening/interpolation (Eq. 20,19) scheme and various wavelet based schemes,
namely the scheme obtained from second order lifted wavelets (Eq. 21,22), the corre-

though these ﬁlters are much longer than the ones used in Eq. 20,19,21,22, the CPU time
does not increase substantially. This come from the fact that on modern computers the
transfer of the data into the cache is the most time consuming part. How many numerical

−

operations are than performed of these data residing in cache has only a minor inﬂuence
on the timing. The combination injection/interpolation (Eq. 18,19), is not shown since
it is much worse, requiring at least the double of the number of iterations for the target
accuracy. Since the convergence rate is slightly faster, the new wavelet based schemes for
restriction and prolongation are always more eﬃcient than the Full Weightening scheme,
both for ﬁnite diﬀerence discretizations and scaling function basis sets.

The main justiﬁcation for the relaxations in the upper part of the traditional multigrid
algorithm shown in Fig. 3 is to eliminate the high frequencies. This can however be done
directly by fast wavelet transformations based on wavelets that have good localization
properties in frequency space such as lifted interpolating wavelets. As a consequence the
traditional multigrid algorithms can be simpliﬁed considerably as shown in Fig. 5. Using
wavelet based restriction and prolongation operators we can completely eliminate the GS
relaxation in the ﬁrst part of the V cycle where we go from the ﬁne grid to the coarsest
grid. We baptize such a simpliﬁed V cycle a halfway V cycle. The numerical results,
obtained with the halfway V cycle, shown in the right hand plots of Fig. 4, demonstrate
that the convergence is slightly faster than for the traditional multigrid algorithm based
on the same restriction and prolongation scheme.
It is
not necessary to calculate the residue after the GS relaxations. Otherwise the number
of GS relaxations and restrictions/prolongations is identical in the full and halfway V
cycle. On purpose no CPU times are given in this context because optimization of certain
routines [10] can entirely change these timings. Because the residue is never calculated in
the halfway V cycle, the memory requirements are also reduced by one third.

In addition one step is faster.

The number of GS relaxations in the halfway V cycle was chosen to be 4 in order to
allow for a entirely unbiased comparison with the traditional V cycle where also 4 GS
relaxations were done on the ﬁnest grid level. For optimal overall eﬃciency putting the
number of GS relaxation to 3 is usually best, with the values of 2 and 4 leading to a
modest increase in the computing time. The convergence rate of halfway V cycles as
a function of the number of GS relaxations on the ﬁnest grid level is shown in Fig 6.
This Figure also shows the inﬂuence if the number of GS iterations is held constant on
each grid level. The resulting increasing number of iterations is more important than the
slightly reduced numerical eﬀort per iteration, leading to roughly a 10 percent increase in
the total CPU time.

6 Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that halfway V cycles with the restriction and prolongation
steps based on wavelet theory are the most eﬃcient approach for the solution of Poisson’s
equation. It is most eﬃcient both for ﬁnite diﬀerence discretizations and for the case where
scaling functions or wavelets are used as basis functions. We expect that the approach
should also be the most eﬃcient one in connection with ﬁnite elements. It is essential
that the wavelet family used for the derivation of the restriction and prolongation schemes
has at least one vanishing moment and conserves thus average quantities on the various
grid levels. Wavelet families with more vanishing moments lead only to a modest increase
of the convergence rate compared to the case of one vanishing moment. Orthogonality

Figure 4: The convergence rate of a sequence of V cycles (left hand side) and halfway
V cycles (right hand side). In the upper two plots Poisson’s equation was discretized by
second order ﬁnite diﬀerences, In the middle two plots by 6-th order ﬁnite diﬀerences and
in the lower two plots by 6-th order interpolating scaling functions. Shown are results for
the Full Weightening scheme (FW) second order lifted wavelets (LFT 2) 6-th order lifted
wavelets (LFT 6) and twofold lifted 4-th order wavelets. In the case of ordinary V cycles
2 GS relaxations were done on the ﬁnest level both when going up and coming back down,
in the case of the halfway V cycle 4 GS relaxation were done on the ﬁnest level. The
number of GS relaxations was allowed to increase by a factor of 2 on each consecutive
coarse grid level.

is not a beneﬁcial feature in this context [17] and therefore interpolating wavelets were
used instead of Daubechies wavelets. In addition to its increased eﬃciency in terms of the
CPU time, the proposed halfway V cycle algorithm is also considerably simpler than the
standard V cycle. This makes not only programming easier, but also reduces the memory
requirements.

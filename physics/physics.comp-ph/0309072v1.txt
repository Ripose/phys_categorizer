Quantum Chromo Dynamics is considered in a setup where the light mesons are squeezed
into unphysically small boxes. We show how such a situation can be used to determine the
couplings of the low energy chiral Lagrangian from lattice simulations, applying chirally
invariant formulations of lattice fermions.

1 Introduction

A straightforward approach for numerical simulations in statistical mechanics or in high
energy physics is to perform them in boxes that are large enough for the relevant correlation
lengths — or the Compton wave lengths of the lightest particles — to live comfortably
inside the box. This is an ideal world and, as it might have been suspected, as far as
numerical simulations are concerned this world is also very expensive. Approaching the
critical point of a second order phase transition, where also a continuum ﬁeld theory is
deﬁned, one needs to increase the correlation length, accompanied by the corresponding
extension of the box size. For models in high energy physics the number of lattice points
needed in the simulations has to be increased with the fourth power in this limit, and
this does not even include additional factors originating from the scaling behavior of the
algorithms employed.

It is one of the fascinating discoveries that physical models of interest can be considered
in unphysical situations while it is still possible to extract correct physical information
from them. The reason is that characteristic properties of a model do not change when it is
considered under unphysical conditions. The advantage of this idea is that often the model
can be considered in a setup where numerical simulations are much easier than in the case
of a large physical volume.

1

Let us give a — not too serious — example to illustrate this idea: think of a folding
chair. If it is unfolded (its physical state), you recognize it easily as a chair and you can use
it as such. However, it would not ﬁt into your car. Folding it (the unphysical state), you
can put it in the car, but it is not recognizable easily as a chair anymore. Still, it is a chair,
of course, and by measuring the length of the struts etc. (which do not change in the folded
state) you can deduce the size of the original chair.

The idea of studying a system as a function of the box size in order to extract physical
information is quite old and proved to be very fruitful. Finite size scaling arguments were
already introduced 1883 by Reynolds for turbulence studies in air and liquid ﬂows. Later
on, they were applied in investigations of critical phenomena at phase transitions to extract
critical exponents 1, to determine scattering lengths 2 and to renormalize scale dependent
quantities such as the running strong coupling constant, the running quark masses and
so-called renormalization constants 3,4. The physical problem we want to consider in
the present article is the dynamics of Goldstone bosons as they appear in the case of a
spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, such as the O(N ) symmetry in non-linear
σ-models and the chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) with massless
quarks.

The dynamics of these Goldstone bosons can be described by chiral perturbation the-
ory 5, which evaluates the chiral Lagrangian. This Lagrangian describes the low energy
properties of some underlying, more fundamental theory. It is constructed such that it
obeys the same (global) symmetries as the fundamental theory. Examples are effective de-
scriptions of the Φ4-theory and, of course, QCD for which chiral perturbation theory was
designed. The structure of the chiral Lagrangian is very general. In leading order it can be
written as

Here U (x)
SU (Nf ) represents the Goldstone boson ﬁeld, Nf is the number of ﬂavors,
mq is the quark mass a and θ is the vacuum angle. The Lagrangian in eq. (1) contains
two so-called low energy constants (LEC), the pion decay constant Fπ and the order pa-
rameter of chiral symmetry breaking, i.e. the scalar condensate Σ. Chiral perturbation
theory allows for a systematic higher order expansion with more complicated terms in
the Lagrangian and corresponding additional LEC multiplying these terms. The LEC are
free parameters of the Lagrangian. They can only be determined by the comparison with
sources beyond chiral perturbation theory. In principle, their values follow from the under-
lying fundamental theory, in this case QCD.

aFor simplicity we assume the same quark mass for all ﬂavors. In a spin model it corresponds to an external
magnetic ﬁeld. Strictly speaking, due to V < ∞ and mq > 0 this kind of symmetry breaking is not fully
spontaneous and we actually deal with remnants of the Goldstone bosons.

Figure 2. Illustration of the ǫ-regime. The Compton wavelength (blue solid line) exceeds the length of the box,
whereas the ﬂuctuations (red dashed line) do ﬁt into the box.

The situation is illustrated in Figure 1 for the p-expansion and in Figure 2 for the ǫ-
expansion. In the p-expansion regime, the pion Compton wavelength ﬁts into the ﬁnite

box, corresponding to an inﬁnite volume situation. In the ǫ-regime, the pion Compton
wavelength exceeds the box length and the zero momentum pion mode appears as a con-
stant mode. Notice, however, that the ﬂuctuations around the constant mode are still well
accommodated within the box.

Numerical simulations are a powerful tool to determine the LEC. These simulations use
the fundamental Lagrangian of QCD itself. Tuning the quark masses such that the regime
of chiral perturbation theory is reached, a comparison of numerically generated QCD data
and the predictions of chiral perturbation theory can be performed. In this way the LEC can
be extracted by a ﬁt of the numerical data to the analytical formulae of chiral perturbation
theory, which contain the LEC as free parameters. The so determined values of the LEC
as originating from QCD can then be related to experimental data leading to direct tests of
QCD. In addition, the simulations can — in principle — be performed exploring different
scenarios. For example one of the quark masses can be put to zero 8 and it can be tested
whether such a scenario would be consistent with the real world.

Knowing the LEC is also an important ingredient to supplement further numerical sim-
ulations themselves. Simulations at small values of the quark mass, corresponding to their
physical values, are very expensive, see e.g. Ref. 9. If we would know, however, at what
values of the quark mass chiral perturbation theory is valid, chiral perturbation theory it-
self could be used to extrapolate many observables to physical values of the quark mass.
Obviously, for this procedure the knowledge of the LEC would be crucial.

Now the obvious question arises why such comparisons of simulation results and chiral
perturbation theory have not been done before. The answer is, they have, but the interpreta-
tion of the outcome has been difﬁcult and no convincing picture emerged. For the inﬁnite
volume simulations it is still not clear when contact to chiral perturbation theory can be
established. Various additional assumptions have to be incorporated into the analytical
computations in chiral perturbation theory to be able to relate them to numerical results 10.
The ﬁnite volume simulations, which seem to be much easier, were hampered by the
fact that the lattice formulations of fermion actions either break chiral symmetry explicitly
(Wilson fermions) or that topological sectors are hard to distinguish (staggered fermions)
11. The identiﬁcation of topological charge sectors is a necessary prerequisite for explor-
ing the ǫ-regime, since here the observables depend strongly on the topology 12. Similar
problems are encountered for improved versions of these lattice fermions.

A great leap forward was achieved with the rediscovery 13 of the Ginsparg and Wil-
son 14 relation, which reads for some (yet to be speciﬁed) lattice Dirac operator D at
mq = 0

γ5D + Dγ5 = aDγ5D .

(2)

Clearly, in the limit of a vanishing lattice spacing a the usual anti-commutation relation of
the continuum Dirac operator is recovered. The Ginsparg-Wilson relation implies an exact
lattice chiral symmetry 15 if the action is constructed with a lattice Dirac operator that
solves the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. Consequently Ginsparg-Wilson fermions have a well
deﬁned fermionic index. By means of the Index Theorem, this property also allows for a
conceptually clean separation of topological sectors 13. Thus one overcomes the obstacles
that other formulations of lattice fermions are plagued with.

For completeness we give a particular example for a solution of the Ginsparg-Wilson
relation found by H. Neuberger 16 from the overlap formalism 17, based on the pioneering

4

work by D. Kaplan 18. To this end, we ﬁrst consider the standard Wilson-Dirac operator

Despite the appearance of the square root which connects all the lattice point with each
other, the operator is local (in the ﬁeld theoretical sense) as long as the gauge coupling is
not too strong 19. However, the numerical implementation of the square root operator is
very demanding and restricts present simulation to the quenched approximation b , see also
the reviews 20,21. A promising approach for a construction of improved overlap operators
is to replace Dw in eq. (3) by alternative operators as proposed in Refs. 22.

2 Random Matrix Theory

Let us now start our discussion of ﬁnite volume physics with the example of a special tech-
nique called Random Matrix Theory (RMT). In many complex systems eigenvalues and
their correlations play an important rˆole. These eigenvalues may exhibit universal proper-
ties that can be described by RMT for many physical systems 24. Among the numerous
application ﬁelds of RMT, also the low lying eigenvalues in the QCD spectrum are ex-
pected to be described by RMT (for a review, see Ref. 25). The theoretical background for
this expectation is the fact that at zeroth order of chiral perturbation theory in the ǫ-regime,
taking only the constant mode U0 into account, the Lagrangians of chiral perturbation the-
ory and the one of RMT are equivalent. Correspondingly, the LEC of chiral perturbation
theory enter also the predictions of RMT, which in turn allows for their determination by
confronting numerical data from lattice QCD simulations with the theoretical formulae
from RMT.

bIn this approximation virtual quark anti-quark states are completely neglected. Although this seems to be a very
crude approximation, it works surprisingly well in practice 23.

5

Such a comparison of the predictions of RMT with numerical simulations is, however,
difﬁcult again, because also in this case the knowledge of the topological charge sectors
and an exact chiral symmetry are important. Both difﬁculties can be overcome elegantly
with the use of operators solving the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. The limitation in this case
will only be the computer time available, but with the machines available at NIC such a
project becomes feasible, though with a rather limited statistics.

Another difﬁculty is that the ﬁnite volume cannot be arbitrarily small. Note that the
Goldstone bosons of the chiral symmetry breaking pick up some mass if a small quark mass
is switched on. The crucial point of chiral perturbation theory is that these quasi-Goldstone
bosons represent the light mesons. Therefore, this effective low energy description can
only work in the world of mesons as bound states. Hence the physical volume should —
roughly speaking — be larger than the conﬁnement scale. As we will see below, RMT can
provide a quantitative answer to the question about the scale where the validity of chiral
perturbation theory sets in.

In Figure 3 we show a result of such a computation 26. It addresses the cumulative
probability distributions (see Ref. 27, Chapter 14) of the lowest (non-zero) Dirac eigenvalue
λ1. For these distributions the predictions of RMT in various topological sectors (solid
lines) are compared with the numerical data of our simulations using the overlap operator.
We see that the data from the quenched simulations are well described by RMT.

Some remarks are in order. The ﬁrst is that the data agree with the theoretical predic-
(1.2 fm)4. Going below
tions only if the lattice corresponds to a physical volume of V >
∼
this size, the predictions collapse. Hence a minimal box length of about 1.2 fm is neces-
sary to be in the mesoscopic world where chiral perturbation and RMT work. The second
remark is that from the probability distribution a value of the scalar condensate can be
extracted and it is found to be consistent with earlier simulation results. The third remark
concerns higher eigenvalues. Here the agreement is not as good as in the case of the lead-
ing non-zero eigenvalue. Generally the RMT predictions are conﬁrmed up to some value
of the dimensionless parameter z = λΣV . This threshold raises gradually if the volume
increases, and it might be related to the so-called Thouless energy 25.

2 exp(

A last remark is of a more general nature: the prediction of the eigenvalue distribu-
tion by RMT for the lowest non-zero eigenvalue 28 in topological charge sector zero reads
P (λ) = z
4 z2). Hence, for simulations in this sector we expect to encounter quite
frequently very small eigenvalues, which will contribute in quark propagators as 1/λ. Now,
from our comparison with RMT we know that the RMT predictions are well respected by
the numerical data. Hence the small eigenvalues in topological charge sector zero have
to appear in the simulations with a non-negligible probability. Clearly, they will give rise
to substantial ﬂuctuations in physical observables, providing exceptionally large contribu-
tions proportional to the inverse of the eigenvalue.

Of course, when the quark mass is chosen large enough it will act as an infrared regu-
lator and therefore cut off the effects of these very small modes. In the ǫ-regime, however,
we want to study the system at small quark masses. This leads to the problem of ﬁnding a
window for simulations in the ǫ-regime: if the quark mass is too small, it cannot act as a
regulator anymore and the small modes will spoil the statistical sample. When, on the other
hand, the quark is chosen to be too large, we leave the ǫ-regime. The situation is clearly
better when we choose a topologically non-trivial sector. Here RMT predicts an eigenvalue
distribution that suppresses low eigenvalues substantially, rendering the simulations much

safer. The problem discussed here is of a very general nature and does also apply to the
case of dynamical fermions. Therefore, it has to be expected that these simulations become
very demanding and problematic if performed close to physical values of the quark masses.
This is another motivation to understand the contact with chiral perturbation very well, in
order to let chiral perturbation theory do the job of computing observables at the physical
point.

3 Meson correlation functions

In a previous NIC proceedings contribution 29 we reported about a test of spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. For that study the evaluation of the zeroth order of
chiral perturbation theory (involving only U0) was necessary. In this follow-up project we
also computed meson correlation functions in the ǫ-expansion regime for which the next
order was known in the full theory 7, but not in the quenched approximation. Therefore,
new analytical computations were necessary for the quenched situation, a work that is
published in Refs. 30,31. On the numerical side, the necessary propagators were computed
using the overlap operator.

7

Restricting ourselves ﬁrst to computations in topological charge sector zero, we found
the correlation functions to be very noisy and with our limited statistics it was not possible
to extract a conclusive signal. We checked that this phenomenon can be understood from
the eigenvalue distribution of RMT. Focusing on the contribution of the lowest eigenvalue
alone (which is the largest contribution) and following Ref. 32 we estimated the statis-
tics required to compute the scalar condensate from the correlation function based on the
eigenvalue distribution of RMT. Indeed, we found that O(104) conﬁgurations would be
necessary to obtain reliable errors 33.

Therefore, we did not explore the topological charge sector zero any further and con-
centrated on topological charge sector one 34. Repeating the analysis from the theoretical
eigenvalue distribution of RMT we found that with O(100) conﬁgurations the errors tend
to stabilize. From chiral perturbation theory we expect that in topological charge sectors

The ﬁrst observation is that this correlation function does not show an exponential
decay but a power law behavior, a clear reﬂection of the fact that the pion Compton wave-
length is larger than the box size. In the axial correlation function there appear again the
two LEC of the effective Lagrangian (1), Fπ and Σ. In Figure 4 we show a ﬁt of our data
to the prediction of eq. (7). For our simulations we used a 124 lattice at β = 6 and worked
in topological charge sector one. From the ﬁt, the value of Fπ can be determined quite
reliably, whereas the value of Σ is rather insensitive and cannot be extracted. The situation
here is somehow complementary to the ﬁt of the spectrum to the RMT predictions that we
discussed in Section 2.

Nevertheless, we see that chiral perturbation theory can be used to compute the LEC
from meson correlation functions. The example of the axial current presented here can be
extended to the scalar and the pseudo-scalar correlation functions (the vector correlation
function is identically zero 31), from which further LEC can be evaluated. However, in the
formulae for those correlation functions additional parameters show up.

4 Conclusions

The somewhat unconventional ǫ-regime of chiral perturbation theory turns out to be an
interesting, but also difﬁcult region to be explored by means of numerical simulations. The
parameters of the simulation have to be chosen with care: the topological charge must not
be zero and the value of the quark mass has to be in a certain window in order to avoid
problems with small eigenvalues on one side, and to avoid leaving the ǫ-expansion regime
on the other side. If these precautions are taken care of, the LEC of the chiral Lagrangian
can be computed from the numerical simulations with powerful consequences for future
simulations in general.

The ǫ-regime served in this study as a kind of service setup to provide the LEC
from “easy” to be done numerical simulations. By exploring the hypothetical world of
quark masses that are much smaller than the physical ones — which can now be done in
numerical simulations — the phenomenology of such a world could be tested. Possibly,
in this way we could learn why the quarks have the masses they assume in nature. The
results that will be obtained in the ǫ-regime might reveal some answers to such questions
in the future and hence this regime may turn out to be not so unphysical after all.

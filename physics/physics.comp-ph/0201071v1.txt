Implementation of the Hough Transform
for 3D Track Reconstruction in Drift Chambers

This paper is devoted to the method developed in Ref. [1] for 3D re-
construction of the straight tracks in the tracking system consisting of the
drift-chamber stereo layers. The method is based on the Hough-transform
approach [2] – the discrete case of more general Radon transform [3] – and
takes into account both coordinates of the hit wires and drift distances not
only for the measurements in one projection, but also in the rotated stereo
layers. The proposed method allows one to resolve the right-left ambiguity
and provides the accordance between vertical and horizontal projections
of the track.

Let the straight track of charged particle be detected by the system of
drift chambers consisting of the cylindrical tubes placed in such a way that
their anode wires stretched along the tube axes are parallel to the vertical
coordinate axis Y . In this case the signals from the drift chambers give
the information about the track projection onto the horizontal plane XZ.
The track projection is described by x(z) = x0 + tx(z − z0), where x0 and
tx = tan θx are the projection oﬀset in z and slope, respectively.

The single measurement from the hit wire includes its coordinates xi,
zi and measured distance ri from the wire to the track. Assume that error
of ri measurement is uniformly distributed within the range [−c, c], where
c ≈ (2 ÷ 3)σ is a tuning parameter of the algorithm while σ is a space
resolution of the drift chamber. At each value of tx, the Hough image of
a single measurement (xi, zi, ri) in the space Px of projection parameters
(x0, tx) is given by two ranges of possible values of x0 (see Fig. 1):

0 ∈ hxi−(zi−z0)tx +(ri−c)q1 + t2

is a lower branch M d.

For chamber operation in the proportional regime (no measurement of
ri), the Hough image of a single hit (xi, zi) is given in the parameter space
Px by a range of possible values of x0 at each value of tx:

x0 ∈ hxi − (zi − z0)tx − Rq1 + t2

where R is the tube radius.

Assume M1, M2, . . . , Mn – are Hough images of single measurements
from n hits belonging to the same track. In this case the Hough image of
the track, M (n), is deﬁned in the parameter space Px as an intersection of
n
set of Hough images Mk, k = 1, . . . , n: M (n) =
k=1 Mk. To characterize
the track reliability level, let us introduce the criterion J(M) which can
be determined as number of hits having produced the Hough image M
of the track. In particular, J(M (n)) = n. For the reconstruction we use
only those M for which J(M) ≥ Jmin, where a threshold value of Jmin is a
tuning parameter of the algorithm. If the intersection M is found, then the
track parameters x0, tx are estimated as coordinates of center of gravity of
M in the parameter space Px.

For 3D reconstruction, it is also necessary to determine the track pro-
jection onto the vertical plane Y Z. For this aim, the set of vertical tubes
(“0” stereo-layers) with set of tubes rotated by the angle α around the axis
Z (“α” stereo-layers) can be used as it is shown in Fig. 2. The Y Z track
projection is described by y(z) = y0 + ty(z − z0), where y0 and ty = tanθy
are the projection oﬀset in z and slope, respectively.

Assume parameters x0, tx for the XZ track projection have already

been determined using measurements in the “0” stereo-layers and Hough-
transform approach described above. Then,
the single measurements
(x′
i, zi, ri) in “α” stereo-layers with hit-wire coordinates determined in the
rotated system X ′Y ′Z (see Fig. 2) can be used for reconstruction of track
projection onto the plane Y Z. The corresponding Hough images of single
measurements are deﬁned in the space Py of the parameters y0, ty by the
following boundaries of possible values of y0 at ﬁxed ty (see Ref. [1] for
more detail):

For the program realization of the discussed algorithm, for example,
for XZ-projection ﬁnding, the space Px of the track parameters x0, tx can
be treated as a discrete two-dimensional raster n × m, which is described

by array of its cells ρ(l, k) with indices l = 1, . . . , n and k = 1, . . . , m. The
Hough image of each hit can be consequently constructed as a strip on the
raster: the current value of the raster cell is increased by a unit if the cell
is located within the limits given by Eqs. (1), (2) or (3). After completing
this procedure the value of each cell of the raster becomes equal to the
number of the Hough stripes having passed the cell. Each local maximum
on the raster exceeding some threshold Jmin, can be identiﬁed with the
XZ projection having the corresponding values of parameters x0, tx.

The selection algorithm of reliable tracks includes ordering the raster
cells according to the criterion J(M) by using a special structure – the
array of bidirectional lists determining the hierarchy of the raster cells ﬁlled
in. The given array of the lists is a vector-column where each element is
a pointer to the list and corresponds to a certain meaning of the criterion
J(M) > Jmin. After ﬁlling the raster, the hierarchy of its cells is built: if
ρ(l, k) ≥ Jmin, then the point (l, k) is added into the list for J = ρ(l, k).

At the ﬁrst step of 3D track reconstruction, the global XZ raster and
its hierarchy are built by using the hits only in the “0” stereo-layers. The
further steps of the algorithm include:

• estimating of the initial values of x0, tx corresponding to the ﬁrst

maximum in the global XZ-raster hierarchy;

• building the local XZ raster and its hierarchy by using the hits in
the “0” stereo-layers within a corridor around the track projection
deﬁned by the initial values of x0, tx;

• improvement of the estimates of x0, tx as coordinates of center of

gravity of the local-raster maximum;

• building the Y Z raster and its hierarchy assigned to the found XZ

projection (x0, tx), by using hits only in the “α” stereo-layers;

• ﬁnding of Y Z projection (y0, ty) assigned to the found XZ projection

(x0, tx), by using the Y Z-raster hierarchy;

• subtraction of the hits in “0” and “α” stereo-layers, which belong
to the 3D-track (x0, tx; y0, ty), and consecutive subtraction of the
corresponding Hough strips from the global raster and its hierarchy.
The procedure described above should be repeated iteratively until there
remain the cells of the global XZ raster exceeding some threshold Jmin.

The examples of global and local XZ rasters for Monte-Carlo tracks
are shown in Fig. 3. The small crosses on the global raster mark Monte-
Carlo tracks on the (x0, tx)-plane of the track projection parameters while

the large crosses correspond to the values x0, tx of reconstructed pro-
jections. Fig. 3a shows a good precision of track reconstruction by the
Hough-transform algorithm described above.

This algorithm has been realized in the program Htr developed for
track ﬁnding in the PC chambers (Pattern Tracker) of the HERA-B Outer
Tracker [4]. The program Htr was integrated into the program environ-
ment of ARTE – the general software for event processing at HERA-B –
and tested both with Monte-Carlo and real data. The tests showed the
stable Htr performance with average track ﬁnding eﬃciency of about 90%
and rate of ghosts at the level 23% under real conditions of PC-chamber
operation. The proposed program realization of the described algorithm
provides the time-consuming optimization of event processing and high ef-
ﬁciency of the track ﬁnding under large track-occupancy of the detector as
well as under high level of noisy and dead channels.

This work was done in the HERA-B software group at DESY, Hamburg.

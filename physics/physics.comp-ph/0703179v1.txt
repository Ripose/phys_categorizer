Abstract. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), suitable for the analysis of nonstationary time
series, is used to investigate power law in some of the Bach’s pitches series. Using DFA method,
which also is a well-established method for the detection of long-range correlations, frequency
series of Bach’s pitches have been analyzed. In this view we ﬁnd same Hurts exponents in the range
(0.7 − 0.8) in his Inventions and sinfonia.

Keywords: Time series, Stochastic analysis

INTRODUCTION

Mathematics and music have some vague sort of afﬁnity, but most often than not
the supposed relationship between the two ﬁelds turns out to consist of complicated
structure. The relationship between mathematics and musical works has been hidden
from the listener since the old days. Thus one is forced to make use of interpretative
techniques in order to search for them, which is problematic from a methodological
point of view. In addition to mathematics being seen as numerical symbolism, music
is closely linked to absolute physical entities, such as frequency and relation between
intervals (an interval is a space between two notes). It is an illustrated fact that not just
musical notation, but also the relationship between music and time has something to
do with mathematics. Among great variety of complex and disordered systems most of
music parameters such as frequency and pitch (pitch is the sound frequency of any given
note) [1, 2, 3], Amplitude or Dynamics (dynamics are the changes in volume during a
musical piece) [4], intervals (intervals are the distances between notes in the musical
scale), Rhythm (rhythm is the structure of the placement of notes in musical time) can
be considered as stochastic processes. Also, some authors try to cluster the music [5].

In this paper we characterize the complex behavior of note frequencies of a selection
of Bach’s Inventions and Sinfonias through computation of the signal parameters and
scaling exponents. Inventions and Sinfonias are a collection of short pieces which Bach
wrote for musical education of his young pupils. In music, an Invention is a short compo-
sition (usually for a keyboard instrument) with two-part counterpoint, which is a broad
organizational feature of much music, involving the simultaneous sounding of separate
musical lines. The Inventions and Sinfonias are two and three voices music pieces re-
spectively. These voices have independent characteristic behavior and for simplicity we
consider only the upper voice. Because of non-stationary nature of music frequency se-
ries, and due to ﬁniteness of available data samples, we should apply methods which are

insensitive to non-stationarities, like trends. In order to separate trends from correlations
we need to eliminate trends in our frequency data. Several methods are used effectively
for this purpose: Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) [6], Rescaled range analysis
(R/S) [7] and Wavelet Techniques (WT) [8].

We use DFA method for the analysis and elimination of trends from data sets. DFA
method introduced by Peng et al. [6] has became a widely used technique for the
determination of (mono-) fractal scaling properties and the detection of long-range
correlations in noisy, non-stationary time series [9, 10]. It has successfully been applied
to diverse ﬁelds such as DNA sequences [6, 11], cardiac dynamics [12], climate [13],
neural receptors [14], economical time series [15] etc.

The paper is organized as follows: In section II we describe DFA methods in details
and analyze the frequency series of the Inventions and Sinfonias. We end the paper by
drawing conclusions.

DFA AND ANALYSIS OF MUSIC FREQUENCY SERIES

To implement the DFA, let us suppose we have a time series, N(i)(i = 1, ..., Nmax) and
j
determine the proﬁle: y( j) = (cid:229)
i=1[N(i) − hNi]. Next we break up N(i) into K non-

overlapping time intervals, In, of equal size t where n = 0, 1, ...K − 1 and K corresponds
to the integer part of Nmax/t . In each box, we ﬁt the integrated time series by using a
polynomial function, ypol(i), which is called the local trend. We detrend the integrated
time series y(i) in each box, and calculate the detrended ﬂuctuation function: Y (i) =
y(i) − ypol(i). For a given box size s, we calculate the root mean square ﬂuctuation:

F(s) =

[Y (i)]2.

The above computation is repeated for box sizes s (different scales) to provide a rela-
tionship between F(s) and s. A power law relation between F(s) and s indicates the
presence of scaling

F(s) ∼ sH.
The parameter H, called Hurst exponent, represents the correlation properties of the
signal: if H = 0.5, there is no correlation and the signal is an uncorrelated signal [6];
if H < 0.5, the signal is anticorrelated; if H > 0.5, there are positive correlations in the
signal. In the two latest cases, the signal can be well approximated by the fractional
Brownian motion law [16]. Also, the auto correlation function can be characterized
by a power law C(s) ≡ hNkNk+si ∼ s−g with g = 2 − 2H. Its power spectra can be
characterized by S(w ) ∼ w −b with frequency w
and b = 2H − 1. In non-stationary
case, correlation exponent and power spectrum scaling are g = −2H and b = 2H + 1,
respectively [6, 17].

It can be checked out that, frequency series is non-stationary. One can verify non-
stationarity properties experimentally by measuring stability of average and variance in
moving windows by, for example, using scale s (Fig. 2a). In Fig. 2b we plot in double-
logarithmic scale the corresponding ﬂuctuation function F(s) against the box size s.

Using the above procedure, we obtain the following estimate for the Hurst exponent:
H = 0.70 ± 0.03. The F(s) exhibits an approximate scaling regime from s = 2 up to
nearly s = 6 (in logarithmic scale). Since H > 0.5 it is concluded that the frequency
series show persistence; i.e. strong correlations between consecutive increments. The
values which derived for quantities of DFA1 method for Invention no. 6 are given in
Table 1 (second line). We have calculated the Hurst exponent for other Inventions and
Sinfonia as well, all being in the 0.7 − 0.8 range (Table 1).

Usually, in DFA method, deviation from a straight line in log-log plot of Eq.(2) occurs
for small scales s. These deviations are intrinsic to the usual DFA method, since the
scaling behavior is only approached asymptotically. Deviations limit the capability of
DFA to determine the correct correlation behavior in very short records and in the regime
of small s. The modiﬁed DFA is deﬁned as follows [9]:

F mod(s) = F(s)

h[Fshuf(s′)]2i1/2 s1/2
h[Fshuf(s)]2i1/2 s′1/2

(for s′ ≫ 1),

(3)

where h[Fshuf(s)]2i1/2 denotes the usual DFA ﬂuctuation function, deﬁned in Eq.(1),
averaged over several conﬁgurations of shufﬂed data taken from original series, and
s′ ≈ N/20. The improvement is very useful especially for short records or records that
have to be split into shorter parts to eliminate problematic nonstationarities, since the
small s regime can be included in the ﬁtting range for the ﬂuctuation exponent H.

The modiﬁed DFA method indicates the correct correlation behavior also in presence
of broadly distributed data, where the common DFA fails to distinguish long-range
correlations from deviations caused by broad distributions. The values of Hurst exponent
obtained by modiﬁed DFA1 methods for frequency series is 0.72 ± 0.03. The relative
deviation of Hurst exponent which is obtained by modiﬁed DFA1 in comparison to
DFA1 for original data is less than 4%.

CONCLUSION

DFA is a scaling analysis method used to quantify long-range power-law correlations
in signals. Many physical and biological signals are ‘noisy’, heterogeneous and exhibit
different types of nonstationarities, which can affect the correlation properties of these
signals. Applying DFA1 method demonstrates that the music frequency series have long

range correlation. We calculated Hurst exponent for other Inventions and Sinfonia and
found it to be in the 0.7 − 0.8 range.

We show that time-dependent ﬂuctuations {∆x} in foreign exchange rates are accurately described
by a random walk in a complex plane that is demarcated into the gain (+) and loss (−) sectors. ∆x
is the outcome of N random steps from the origin and |∆x| is the square of the Euclidean distance
of the ﬁnal N -th step position. Sign of ∆x(t) is set by the N -th step location in the plane. The
model explains not only the exponential statistics of the probability density of {∆x} for G7 markets
but also its observed asymmetry, and power-law dependent broadening with increasing time delay.

Easier data access via the Internet and the widespread
availability of powerful computers, have enabled many
researchers not just in business and economics [1] but also
in physics, applied mathematics, and engineering [2, 3,
4, 5], to investigate more deeply the dynamics of foreign
exchange markets. Their eﬀorts have led to new insights
on the characteristics of forex rate ﬂuctuations including
the general behavior of their corresponding probability
density function (pdf ) [2, 4].

Arguably, forex markets have a more immediate and
direct impact on citizens than stock markets do. This
is especially true in developing countries where only a
minority holds stocks directly while a majority sells or
purchases products and commodities on a daily basis.
Economies that rely strongly on remittances of overseas
contract workers (e.g. Philippines) or tourism (e.g. Thai-
land), are also quite sensitive to forex rate instabilities.
Hence, knowledge of the vagaries of the forex market, is
important not only to policymakers and macroeconomic
managers in government and banking sectors but also to
individual businessmen and consumers.

The exchange rate of a currency relative to another
(usually the US dollar) is represented by a time-series
of quotations {x(t)}, where time t = m∆t, ∆t =
time delay, and index m = 1, 2, . . . , M . Normally, the
power spectrum of {x(t)} consists of one or two domi-
nant low-frequency components and a continuous high-
frequency band. The low-frequency components reveal
the longterm behavior of {x(t)} and therefore the sound-
ness of a national economy from the perspective of eco-
nomic fundamentals. The high-frequency components
are associated with ﬂuctuations in {x(t)} that arise from
complex interactions between market players over short
time-scales (∆t < 2 days) [2, 4].

The statistics of the (percentage) rate ﬂuctuations
{∆x(t)} = {∆x} in G7 markets is described by an
exponentially-decaying pdf p(∆x, ∆t) where: ∆x(t) =
[x(t + ∆t) − x(t)][100/x(t)]. This statistical behavior is
not easily seen from the power spectrum of {x(t)}. Fig-
ure 1 shows the p(∆x, ∆t)’s for the Japanese (1a) and
Philippine (1b) markets. For the G7 [6] and Philippine

[7] markets, our core data sets for {x(t)} comprise of
daily closing rates from January 1971 to December 1993
(M = 5000 trading days, ∆t = 1 day). The Philippine
market was under exchange control in the 70’s and its
p(∆x, ∆t) has a large number of points around ∆x = 0.
Most p(∆x, ∆t)’s exhibit a degree of asymmetry about
∆x = 0. An asymmetric p(∆x, ∆t) is described by a pair
of exponents αl and αr for ∆x < 0 (left) and ∆x > 0
(right), respectively.
It is displayed by currencies that
have either appreciated (e.g. Japan) or depreciated (e.g.
Canada, Philippines) against the USD during the sam-
pling period.

βr of p(∆x, ∆t = 1 day) with the ∆x = 0 line for the G7
markets. The exponential behavior of p(∆x, ∆t) persists
even for ∆t’s > 2 days. We also found that p(∆x, ∆t)
broadens with ∆t in a power-law trend.

The behavior of {x(t)} has been described previously
as a Markov process with multiplicative noise and the
emergence of a highly-symmetric p(∆x, ∆t) such as that
of the German market [2, 4], is explained by the Fokker-
Planck equation. However, these studies did not explain
the emergence of asymmetric p(∆x, ∆t)’s and the power-
law behavior of their broadening with ∆t.

Here, we show that the statistics of {∆x} is accurately
described by a random walk on a demarcated complex
plane. Our model accounts for possible asymmetry of
p(∆x, ∆t), its broadening with increasing ∆t, and the
power-law behavior of this broadening for G7 markets.
Each ∆x is the outcome of N random steps that start
Its magnitude is
from the plane origin O (see Fig 2).
|∆x| = d2, where d is the Euclidean distance of the N -th
step endpoint N(xR, xI ) from origin O, and xR and xI
are the real and imaginary coordinates. The sign of ∆x
depends on the location of N(xR, xI ) in the plane which
is demarcated by the polar angle Θ, into two regions
representing the gain (+) and loss (−) regimes.

Consistent with the central-limit theorem, the location
of N(xR, xI ) is governed by a Gaussian pdf (N → ∞) [8]:
pN (xR, xI ) = (2πσ2)−1 exp[−(x2

is the variance. Hence, the d2-values obey a negative-
exponential statistics: pd(d2) = (2σ2)−1 exp(−d2/2σ2).
The q-th moment h(d2)qi of d2 is given by: h(d2)qi =
q!(2σ2)q = q!hd2iq, where the mean value hd2i is 2σ2.
Phase θ of N(xR, xI ) obeys a uniform statistics: pθ(θ) =

As it is, the statistics of a random walk in a complex
plane is insuﬃcient to describe the characteristics of the
p(∆x, ∆t)’s of forex markets because the possible ∆x’s
are from −∞ to ∞, while d2 ≥ 0.

Demarcated complex plane. We solve the problem by
demarcating the complex plane into two sectors repre-
senting the gain (+∆x) and loss (−∆x) regimes, where
we identify that: |∆x| = d2. The gain area is set by the
polar angle Θ (counterclockwise rotation) and ∆x is pos-
itive (negative) if N(xR, xI ) is on the gain (loss) sector.
The gain (loss) area is zero if Θ = 0 (Θ = 2π).

Figure 3 presents exponentially-decaying histograms of
∆x’s generated at Θ = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π (360
deg). The histograms are asymmetric about ∆x = 0 at
all angles except at Θ = π where the plane is equally
divided between the gain and loss sectors. The corre-
sponding Θ’s for the G7 markets in Table I are not easily
determined since Θ is not clearly related with αl, αr, βl,
and βr. However, our model reveals a unique relation
between R = Al/Ar and Θ, where Al (Ar) is the area
under the best-ﬁt exponential for ∆x < 0 (∆x > 0) of
the histogram.

Figures 4a-b plot the average hRi as a function N and
number of trials, respectively (Θ = π). hRi is insensitive
to N but for a ﬁxed N , the standard deviation of hRi
decreases quickly (power-law decay) with the number of
trials . Figure 4c shows that the dependence of hRi with

Θ is well-described by: hRi = Θ/(360 deg − Θ).

The hRi’s are calculated from p(∆x, ∆t)’s of the G7
markets and then used to determine their correspond-
ing Θ’s via the R(Θ)-curve. The following Θ’s (deg)
were obtained (∆t = 1 day): Canada (179.7), France
(180.4), Germany (182.3), Italy (177.8), Japan (177.6),
and UK (174.9). For the G7 markets, diﬀerences in the
size of the gain and loss sectors are small (< 4%). On
the other hand, the p(∆x, 1 day) for the Philippine mar-
ket is highly asymmetric with a signiﬁcantly small gain
region (Θ = 108.1 deg). Against the USD, the Philippine
peso depreciated by 246% from December 1983 (lifting of
exchange control) to December 1993.

Broadening of p(∆x, ∆t) with time delay ∆t. For
the G7 markets, p(∆x, ∆t) broadens with increasing ∆t,
while preserving its original negative exponential statis-
tics within: 1 ≤ ∆t (day) ≤ 20. Previous studies on
broadening were conﬁned to ∆t < 12 hours [4].

the scale-free behavior of the Philippine market. The
largest standard deviation for Canada and UK is ±0.2
and ±0.1, respectively which happens at ∆t = 1 day,
while for Philippines it is ±1.4 (∆t = 3 days). For
any G7 market, h∆xi increases with ∆t according to a
power law since the exponent is inversely proportional to
1/2σ2 = 1/h∆xi.

The observed power-law dependence of the broaden-
ing of p(∆x, ∆t) with ∆t is explained as follows. Let
h∆xQi = hdT i2, be the average ﬂuctuation correspond-
ing to a longer time-delay ∆tQ = Q∆t, where: dT =
| Pq dq exp(jθq)| = [(Pq dq cos θq)2 + (Pq dq sin θq)2]1/2,
∆t is the basic time delay, and q = 1, 2, . . . , Q. If hd1i =
hd2i = . . . = hdQi, then hdT i = hd1ih[(Pq cos θq)2 +
(Pq sin θq)2]1/2i ≈ Qphd1i.

The hdT i value depends on the probability distribution
of {θq}. If the θq’s are statistically independent and uni-
formly distributed within [0, 2π] then dT ≈ Q1/2hd1i, i.e.
p ≈ 0.5. Figure 6 inset plots αl and |αr| of p(∆xQ, Q)
with Q for the above case which veriﬁes our assumption
of a power-law dependence of hdT i with hd1i.

Figure 6 plots p as a function of uncertainty spread δθ.
If θq’s are restricted such that θq+1 (q > 1) is uniformly-
random within the forward (−π/2 ≤ θq − 0.5δθ ≤ θq+1 ≤
θq + 0.5δθ ≤ π/2) and opposite (π/2 ≤ (θq + π) − 0.5δθ ≤
θq+1 ≤ (θq + π) + 0.5δθ ≤ 3π/2) directions then: 0 ≤
p ≤ 0.5.
If the θq’s occur only within the forward or
opposite direction then 0.5 ≤ p ≤ 1. In all cases, θ1 is

uniformly-random in the range [0, 2π].

A G7 market exhibits a (∆t)−0.5-dependence (i.e. p ≈
1/4) of αl (Fig 5) because dq+1 is equally likely to be in
the same or opposite direction of dq, with δθ ≈ 0.3 (17
deg). For a market where the directions of dq+1 and dq
are statistically independent of each other, the decay of
αl with ∆t is faster (p ≈ 1/2, Fig 6 inset).

In our model, the forex market consists of N indepen-
dent players where ∆x is treated as a random walk of N
steps in the demarcated complex plane where |an|2 rep-
resents the ﬂuctuation |∆xn| of the n-th player. Plane
anisotropy leads to asymmetric pd(d2)’s. Our model
also explains the power-law dependent broadening of the
p(∆x, ∆t)’s with ∆t in G7 markets.

∆x is interpreted as the intensity of the resultant com-
plex amplitude that arises from the linear superposition
of the ﬂuctuations of the N independent dealers.
In-
teractions between players arises inherently because the
intensity which is the product of the resultant complex
amplitude and its conjugate, contains interference terms
between the contributions of the individual players. We
showed that real market dynamics could be analyzed ac-
curately with a relatively low number of the interacting
players. The interaction between the multitude of agents
in a real market could be eﬀectively reduced into one with
a low number of representative classes.

Our model currently neglects the phenomenon of al-
lelomimesis which causes social agents to cluster[10].
Herding (bandwagoning) among market dealers could
trigger massive selling or buying in ﬁnancial markets and
leads to large swings in {x(t)} like those found in the
middle 1980’s for the G7 markets. The same limitation
is found in previous models of forex markets [3, 4].

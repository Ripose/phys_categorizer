We report the development of a new ray-tracing simulation tool having the potential of the full
characterization of a radio link through the accurate study of the propagation path of the signal from
the transmitting to the receiving antennas across a perturbed atmosphere. The ray-tracing equations
are solved, with controlled accuracy, in three dimensions (3D) and the propagation characteristics
are obtained using various refractive index models. The launching of the rays, the atmospheric
medium and its disturbances are characterized in 3D. The novelty in the approach stems from the
use of special numerical techniques dealing with so called stiﬀ diﬀerential equations without which
no solution of the ray-tracing equations is possible. Starting with a given launching angle, the
solution consists of the ray trajectory, the propagation time information at each point of the path,
the beam spreading, the transmitted (resp. received) power taking account of the radiation pattern
and orientation of the antennas and ﬁnally, the polarization state of the beam. Some previously
known results are presented for comparative purposes and new results are presented as well as some
of the capabilities of the software.

INTRODUCTION

Multipath propagation is believed to be the major
cause of data transmission impairments in terrestrial line
of sight microwave radio systems. Eﬃcient antenna de-
sign requires the understanding of the propagation of in-
dividual rays across the channel and gauging the refrac-
tive index of the various atmospheric disturbances any
given ray encounters during its propagation. Adopting
a refractive index model for a given disturbance arising
from spatial ﬂuctuations in humidity, pressure or tem-
perature (these ﬂuctuations might be temporal as well,
but we shall consider, for the time being, that the prop-
agation time occurs on a time scale much smaller than
the one associated with these ﬂuctuations), we establish
the ray propagation equations and solve them with sev-
eral numerical techniques having a ﬁrst, fourth and sixth
order accuracy. The ray tracing equations are initially
solved in two dimensions bypassing the eﬀects of small
and non-linear terms as explained in section 2. Later on,
we switch to 3D in order to assess the eﬀects the small
and non-linear terms have on ray propagation. Several
facts emerge from this approach:

•

The small non-linear terms lead to a breakdown of
standard integration techniques. The ray equations
which constitute a system of 6 ordinary coupled
non-linear diﬀerential equations become stiﬀ. This
means the integration step becomes so small (be-
cause of the presence of terms that diﬀer by several
orders of magnitude) making the integration pro-

cess so slow that any progress in seeking a solution
of the system is virtually stopped.

•

•

The relation between the launching and arrival an-
gles for a given disturbance are profoundly altered.
What was previously believed to be a ”good” or
”bad” launching angle might have gotten its true
attributes from reasons diﬀerent from what is cur-
rently known.

A very high sensitivity is observed around certain
launching angles: a very small uncertainty in the
launching angle can induce the ray to take a path
radically diﬀerent from what is normally expected.

This report is organized in the following way: In sec-
tion 2, we establish the ray-tracing equations (RTE). In
section 3 we describe some of the problems encountered
during the solution of the RTE, namely those related to
stiﬀness and present the algorithms to cure them (Ap-
pendix A contains a description and an example of a
stiﬀ system). In section 4 we compare our approach to
previous ones and present some illustrative new cases in
section 5. This section also describes the potential ap-
plications of the software and its capabilities. Section 6
discusses some possibilities for future developments. Ap-
pendix B shows how to avoid stiﬀ diﬀerential equations in
two dimensions and turn the RTE into a set of recursion
relations.

In terrestrial microwave radio systems, the range of
frequencies used and in comparison the range of length
scales present in the channel allow us to use a geometric
(or ray) approach to electromagnetic propagation. The

fundamental equation of geometrical optics is the Eikonal
equation :

where n is the local refractive index and S is the local
phase of the ray. Taking the gradient of both sides of the
Eikonal equation gives the second order vector propaga-
tion equation:

(gradS)2 = n2

d( ndR
ds )
ds

= gradn

where R is the ray position and ds is a diﬀerential
, the

displacement along the ray path, i.e. ds =
norm of the vector dR.

dR

||

||

This can be rewritten as a system of two ﬁrst order

equations:

= T

dR
ds
d(nT)
ds

= gradn

(3)

where T is a unit vector tangent to the ray path (The
geometry is depicted in Fig.1). The advantage of solving
a ﬁrst order system rather than a single second order
system is threefold:

Stability problems are easier to handle.

Validity of the solution is easy to monitor since one
has to have for all times
= 1 providing a sim-
||
ple means to check the quality of the integration
procedure.

T

||

Accuracy of the solution is controlled within certain
tolerance limits depending on the selected integra-
tion step.

This is discussed in detail in section 5. The refractive

index function of the atmosphere is written as:

2

where k is the refractive index gradient with height
h. The atan() term above is due to a disturbance lo-
cated at a height h0 having an extent ∆h and a refrac-
tive strength ∆n. For a normal atmosphere (∆n = 0 in
the Webster model) both models are linear in h (after
expanding the exponential to ﬁrst order). Nevertheless,
their dependence solely on height does not account for
the 3D nature of the atmosphere and its disturbances.
Some models like the recent one introduced by Costa [3]
mimics a 3D atmospheric disturbance by multiplying the
refractive index along the vertical with a Gaussian func-
tion along the horizontal perpendicular to the ray path
plane. Going beyond these approaches, we introduce a
full 3D proﬁle:

(1)

(2)

N = px(x)py(y)ph(h) + kh + N0

(5)

where px, py and ph are the index proﬁles of the dis-
turbance along the three directions in space x, y and h.
N0 is an average normal atmosphere index and k is the
index gradient along the height. A proﬁle function p(X),
along direction X is typically taken as:

p(X) = (∆nx/2)[tanh((X

X1)/∆X1)
−
X2)/∆X2)]

(6)

tanh((X

−

−

where X1 (resp. X2) is the point where the hump
starts growing (resp. decaying) and ∆X1 (resp. ∆X2) is
a typical length scale for the growth (resp. decay). ∆nx
is the refractive strength of the disturbance. This model,
though realistically representing a localized anisotropic
disturbance in the atmosphere is based on a separable
model of the refractive index function.

While our methodology can handle any arbitrary 3D
model of the refractive index, any of these refractive mod-
els have to be modiﬁed in order to take account of the
curvature of the Earth by the inclusion of a term [2] equal
to 106h/Re where Re is the radius of the Earth.

Using [4], the ray-tracing system [3] is rewritten as:

where N depends on the frequency used, humidity
conditions and height above the Earth ground. Several
models exist for the range of frequencies and heights we
are dealing with and are generally expressed in N units.
The following two models are of interest; the ﬁrst for a
normal atmosphere and the second for a disturbed one:

These terms can be eliminated with the following pro-
cedure: Replace equation [7-b] by another equation deﬁn-
ing the curvature of the ray path r:

dT
ds

= U/ρ

(8)

where U is the normal to the trajectory. U is perpen-
dicular to T and normalized:
= 1. The unknown ρ
can be determined by taking the scalar product of both
sides of [7-b] with U and using [8]; one gets:

U

||

||

1/ρ = U.gradN/(N + 106)

(9)

Substituting [9] in [8] gives the following system:

= T

dR
ds
dT
ds

= U(U.gradN )/(N + 106)

(10)

In general, this system is not closed because it involves
U besides R and T.
In two dimensions, one can close
the system by invoking [1] the orthogonality of U and T
through:

U = x

T

(11)

×
where x is the unit vector along the x direction. With
relation [11], system [10] is now closed and can be in-
tegrated by any standard explicit integration method
(Predictor-corrector, Euler, Runge-Kutta, Richardson
etc...). This will be illustrated in section 4.
In gen-
eral, N is a function of the position vector R; when it
depends only on the height, it is possible to further sim-
plify the system and reduce it to a single scalar equation.
In the case N depends only on height, gradN is along
the vertical and if ψ is the angle T makes with the lo-
cal horizontal, U being perpendicular to T will make the
same angle with the vertical, [9] yields:

Livingston [4] has derived an equation similar to [12]:

(1/n)(dn/dh)cosψ

(13)

Equation [13]

is equivalent to [12] when the right
sign is used. We have integrated system [10] in two
dimensions and recovered typical results found in the
literature, avoiding the diﬃculty arising from [7-b]. In
the three dimensional case, one has to deal directly
with system [7] with all terms retained, for, in general,
the T vector does no longer have to be conﬁned to the

3

transmitter (TX) receiver (RX) plane. In this case, all
standard explicit integration schemes break down.
In
other words, the norm of the vector T tangent to the
ray path is no longer conserved. In order to fulﬁll the
condition
= 1, one has to take an integration step
so small that the integration process is virtually stopped.
This is called stiﬀness and an illustrative example is
given in Appendix A.

R

||

||

Stiﬀness can be cured with the so called implicit in-
tegration schemes.
In contrast to explicit integration
schemes where a current system value depends only on
the previous ones, implicit schemes couple present and
past values of the system altogether. A price to pay is an
increase in CPU time but the rewards are stability, accu-
racy and large integration steps. We have implemented
two implicit schemes:

Generalized Runge-Kutta (GRK) method of fourth
order [5].

Rosenbrock (ROW) method of sixth order [6].

In the ﬁrst scheme, given a system of ﬁrst order ordi-

nary diﬀerential equations (ODE):

dy/ds = f (y)

(14)

one builds the vectors from the system values at step

ki = σf (yn−1 +

and evaluates the next value n of the system with:

coeﬃcients and ( ∂f
∂y ) is the Jacobian of the system. The
above equations are implicit since the unknown vectors
ki needed for integration step n appear on both sides
of [15]. In the GRK method, only the vector function f
is needed whereas in the ROW case both f and its ﬁrst
order derivative (Jacobian) are needed.

P

Both methods have been proven to perform very well
up to stiﬀness parameters (ratio of the highest to the
smallest eigenvalue of the Jacobian) as high as 107. Inci-
dentally, our stiﬀness parameter has been observed (while
testing ROW algorithms) to be generally around 104. We
have used GRK of order 4 and ROW of order 6 because
they have been extensively tested for a wide range of
systems and are thoroughly documented.

IV. VALIDATION OF THE APPROACH AND
COMPARISONS WITH PREVIOUS
TREATMENTS

In order to validate our technique, we started with a
comparison against analytically known solutions. Three
models were tested, the axial gradient refractive index
case, the sine-wave optical paths and the classical Luneb-
urg lens (see, for instance, reference 7). In all three cases
our results compared very accurately with the analyti-
cal ones. Then we went ahead and proceeded to solve in
detail a case well documented in the literature and inves-
tigated by Webster [2] for various launching angles. This
model is two dimensional (2D) and extensively referred
to in the literature. We use the 2D version of the system
of equations [10] which is non-linear (N is a non-linear
function of R and a power of U appears in [10-b]).

The integration, started by taking values of R and
T as the initial location and launching vectors, is done
with a ﬁrst- order Euler and fourth order Runge-Kutta
methods. The TX-RX conﬁguration and propagation
conditions are the same as those given in Table 1 of
Webster’s [2] paper.
In Fig.2 we show the various
ray paths between the TX and the RX for a series of
launching angles (taken with respect to the horizontal)
varying from -0.25 up to 0.5 degrees. The diﬀerent
launching angles, we use, are respectively, in degrees:
-0.25, -0.20, -0.15, -0.10, -0.05, 0.0, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40,
0.50. The refractive index proﬁle used in the study is
displayed in Fig.3.

While Fig.2 is based on a ﬁrst order (Euler) integra-
tion method, some changes might occur if we rather use
a fourth order Runge-Kutta method.
In fact, the ray
paths based on either scheme show no appreciable dif-
ferences and compare well with the results found earlier
by Webster in the same conditions. However, some dis-
crepancies appear for positive launching angles and are
probably due to the diﬀerent levels of numerical accu-
racy between our treatment and Webster’s. Let us recall
that in our case the numerical accuracy is monitored by
checking the conservation of the norm of T.
In these
simulations, it is conserved with an error smaller than
10−7. In order to compare our results to Webster’s di-
rectly, we derive, in the same fashion, recursion equations
for the ray radial distance R (taken from the center of
the Earth) and the angle ψ that T makes with the local
horizontal. Referring to Appendix B and Fig.4, we can
write the following relations:

R2 = R1 + ds sin(ψ1)
cos(ψ1)

ψ2 = ψ1 + ds

R1 −

(17)

(18)

where the radius of curvature ρ1 is given by [12] with
ψ = ψ1 and dN/dh is taken at the height R
Re (Re
is the Earth radius). For a given step ds, one starts

−

4

the set of iterations [17] and [18] with the launching
radial distance R1 and angle ψ1. Using the same
initial values as before we retrieve almost the same
ray trajectories obtained in Fig.2. The validity of our
results is monitored by the constancy of the modulus
of T versus 1. Additionally, we compared our results
(Euler and Runge-Kutta) to a very high accuracy inte-
gration technique based on the Butcher’s [8] algorithm
(seven-stage sixth-order Runge-Kutta scheme). The
sixth order results are virtually identical to the fourth
order’s and Fig.5 depicts the ray trajectory obtained
with the diﬀerent levels of accuracy under the same
atmospheric and launching conditions.
Incidentally,
the diﬀerence between fourth and sixth order trajecto-
ries in Fig.5 are on the order of a fraction of a millimeter.

In spite of the above agreement, which is basically rela-
tive, one still has to gauge independently the accuracy of
the results for a selected order and integration step. This
is done with the following method: Pick an order p and
an integration step σ; integrate once with σ and twice
with σ/2 in order to reach the same point; deﬁne a step
ratio κ from the diﬀerence ∆ between the two results:

κ = p+1
p

and monitor the value of k for a given tolerance, during
2. In Fig.6, we
integration. Ideally, we should have κ
display κ versus the integration step number for the ﬁrst
order (Euler, p=1) case as well as the Runge-Kutta 4-th
order (p=4) and Butcher 6-th order (p=6) for a tolerance
of 1 millimeter. We use exactly the same condition as
previously and a launching angle of 0.2 degrees. The
ﬁgure shows clearly the superiority of 4-th and sixth order
methods for the selected step when such a high accuracy
is desired.

V.

ILLUSTRATIVE RESULTS AND

CAPABILITIES OF THE METHODOLOGY

We move on to the description of the 3D propagation
case and show, with a simple example, how we evalu-
ate the power from the antenna radiation pattern, the
beam spreading and the state of polarization. We select
a coordinate system such that the TX is somewhere on
the z-axis whereas the y-axis is along the TX-RX line.
The vertical plane is deﬁned by the z axis and the TX-
RX line. The beam spreading is evaluated by launching
simultaneously several beams in the vertical and horizon-
tal planes with angles diﬀering by a small amount from
those characterizing the main beam. The logarithm of
the ratio of the surfaces swept by the diﬀerent beams at
the receiver location gives an estimate of the spreading
loss.
In order to account for the TX-RX antenna ra-
diation pattern, we simply recall that the electric ﬁeld
radiated by a parabolic circular aperture antenna at a

point deﬁned by its distance r from the main lobe origin
and making an angle θ with the lobe axis is given by:

E(r, θ) = jβE0a[exp(

jβr)/r] J1(βa sinθ)/βsinθ (20)

−

where a is the aperture radius, E0 is a reference ﬁeld,
β = 2π/λ with λ the wavelength used, J1 is the Bessel
function of the ﬁrst kind and j = √
1. The antenna pat-
:
E(r, θ)
tern is obtained after normalizing the value of

−

J1(βa sinθ)/sinθ
f (θ) = (2/βa)
|

|

(21)

Alluding to our choice of axes, if the main lobe is point-
ing in a direction deﬁned by the angles β, γ (in the verti-
cal and horizontal plane respectively) and we have a ray
along β′, γ′, the angle the ray makes with the main lobe
axis is:

θ = cos

The power (in dB) is given by 20 log10f (θ). The polar-
ization state of a ray rotates, during propagation, by an
angle calculated with the help of the following formula:

φ(A, B) =

ds/τ

(23)

B

Z

A

where A and B represent the two end points of the
ray trajectory; τ , the local torsion of the ray is diﬀerent
from zero when the trajectory is not conﬁned to a plane.
Using the Frenet-Serret [1] formula:

dB/ds =

τ U

−

(24)

Taking the dot product with U on both sides of equa-

tion [24] and replacing the value of τ in [23], one gets:

φ(A, B) =

A

In order to evaluate the polarization rotation of the
ray propagating from A to B with [25], a ﬁnite diﬀerence
approximation Bn
Bn−1 is used for the diﬀerential dB,
where the subscripts refer to the integration step. The
ﬁnal discrete formula for the polarization angle reads:

−

φ(A, B) =

ds2/(Bn−1.Un)

(26)

n=N

Xn=1

where N is the number of integration steps between A
and B. For illustration, we treat two 3D examples. In
the ﬁrst case, we take a refractive index model consisting
of a refractive layer of ﬁnite length along the TX-RX

5

line. The linear extent of the layer is taken respectively
as 5, 10 15, 20 and 25 kms. Fig.7 shows the dramatic
eﬀect the extent has on the ray path. Incidentally, the
refractive index model along the height is taken as the
same Webster model as before and the ray launching is
made in the vertical plane. In the second case, we take a
refractive index model given by a Webster proﬁle along
z and a proﬁle py(y) given by [5]. Moreover we take
an arbitrary 3D launching direction. The resulting 3D
ray trajectory for the selected parameters listed in the
corresponding caption is displayed in Fig.8.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS

We intend to use this technique to study the dynam-
ics of microwave radio signals controlled by unstable
atmospheric layers. The instabilities cause short error
bursts lasting from many tens of micro-seconds to a
few milliseconds [10].
Since, the error bursts have
detrimental impact on communication networks [11], the
future digital radio systems should be made immune to
radio propagation degradations causing them. In order
to develop defense strategies against the error bursts
caused by atmospheric propagation instabilities, the
physical characteristics of the instabilities have to be
well understood. This 3D ray- tracing technique will
be used to study the eﬀects of dynamically changing
atmospheric layers of limited size on microwave radio
signals received simultaneously by a few parabolic
antennas [12]. A propagation model simulating the
recorded dynamics of received radio signals [10] will,
not only, help understanding the physical causes of the
error bursts, but it will also be used in the computer
optimization of antenna designs capable of minimizing
the frequency of occurrence of the propagation caused
error bursts. Highly accurate numerical techniques are
required since small ﬂuctuations of the atmospheric
conditions are believed to be responsible for the ﬂat
phase ﬂuctuations impairing the digital demodulation of
the received microwave radio signals.

system, the antennas in the vertical yz plane, a
typical ray path and the local Frenet-Serret system
(T, U, B) attached to a point along the path.

Fig. 2: Euler ﬁrst order 2D results. The rays are launched
in the vertical plane and the angle they make with
respect to the horizontal xy plane is respectively: -
0.25, - 0.20, -0.15, -0.10, -0.05, 0.0, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30,
0.40, 0.50 degrees. Equations [10] are used along
with model [4-b] for a perturbed atmosphere N =

Fig. 3: Webster [2] model refractive index function (in
N units) along the vertical showing an anomaly
at a height of 175 meters and whose width is
equal to 100 meters. The curvature of the Earth
term 106h/Re is present. The negative gradient
of the layer refractive index is responsible for the
multipath eﬀects observed.

Fig. 4: Geometry of the ray trajectory used for establish-
ing the recursion equations. The local tangent T
vectors are shown making the angle ψ with the
local horizontal perpendicular to the ray vectors
R drawn from the center of the Earth O. Two
neighboring points along the ray paths are shown.

Fig. 5: Comparative study of the ray trajectories obtained
from the recursion relations [17] and [18] (upper-
most long dashed curve) and 1st order Euler (full
line curve) on one hand, and the Runge-Kutta
(4-th order) and Butcher (6-th order) on the other
(short dashed curve). The launching angle in all

Fig. 6: Comparative study of the behavior of the step
ratio versus step number for the Euler (1st order),
the Runge-Kutta (4-th order) and the Butcher
(6-th order) methods when the step is ﬁxed to its
starting value.
Ideally, this ratio should always
be about 2. In the ﬁrst order case, the bound is
violated very rapidly (upper curve), whereas it is
respected until almost the end of the trajectory
in the 4-th (long dashed curve) and 6-th order
(short dashed curve) cases. The tolerance is 1 mm
and the step used is one hundredth the TX-RX
distance.

Fig. 7: GRK (Implicit, 4-th order, 3D) results for the ray
trajectories when the extent of the layer is a vari-
able. Starting with a launching angle of 0.2 degrees
in the vertical plane, the layer spans, initially, the
entire hop of 60 kms (lowest curve). Moving up-
ward from the next lower curve, the layer extent
(along the TX-RX line) is from 5 to 25 kms, then
5 to 20 kms, 5 to 15 kms and ﬁnally 5 to 10 kms.
In all cases, the refracting layer model is the same
as in Figure 2.

Fig. 8: GRK (Implicit, 4-th order, 3D) results for the
ray trajectory when the refractive index of the
layer varies along two spatial directions (y and z)
and round Earth proﬁle considered. The normal
atmosphere parameters are N0=300 N units and
the gradient k=-39 N units/km. The 3D refractive
index layer is described with a proﬁle along y given
by [tanh((y
y2)/∆y)]/2

∆n atan[12.63(z
meters, ∆h =100 meters and ∆n= -20.0 N units.
The launching angles are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and
0.5 degrees in the vertical plane with 0 and 0.001
degrees in the horizontal plane. The TX is at 125
meters along the z axis and the TX-RX antenna
separation is 60 kms.

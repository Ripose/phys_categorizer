Abstract

A simple and explicit technique for the numerical solution of the two-particle, time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation is assembled and tested. The technique can handle
interparticle potentials that are arbitrary functions of the coordinates of each parti-
cle, arbitrary initial and boundary conditions, and multi-dimensional equations. Plots
and animations are given here and on the World Wide Web of the scattering of two
wavepackets in one dimension

Introduction

Rather than showing the time dependence of two particles interacting with each other,
quantum mechanics textbooks often present a time-independent view of a single particle
interacting with an external potential. In part, this makes the physics clearer, and in part,
this reﬂects the diﬃculty of solving the time-independent two-particle Schr¨odinger equation
for the motion of wavepackets. In the classic quantum mechanics text by Schiﬀ [1], examples
of realistic quantum scattering, such as that in Fig. 1, are produced by computer simulations
of wave packets colliding with square potential barriers and wells. Generations of students
have carried memories of these images (or of the ﬁlm loops containing these frames [2]) as
to what realistic quantum scattering looks like.

While Fig. 1 is a good visualization of a quantum scattering processes, we wish to
extend simulations of realistic quantum interactions to include particle–particle scattering
when both particles are represented by wavepackets. Although more complicated, this,
presumably, is closer to nature and may illustrate some physics not usually found in quantum
mechanics textbooks. In addition, our extension goes beyond the treatment found in most
computational physics texts which concentrate on one-particle wavepackets [3, 4, 5], or
highly restricted forms of two-particle wavepackets [6].

The simulations of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation shown by Schiﬀ were based
on the 1967 ﬁnite-diﬀerence algorithms developed by Goldberg et al. [2]. Those simulations,
while revealing, had problems with stability and probability conservation. A decade later,

taken from the textbook by Schiﬀ. The mean energy equals the barrier height.

Cakmak and Askar [7] solved the stability problem by using a better approximation for the
time derivative. After yet another decade, Visscher [8] solved the probability conservation
problem by solving for the real and imaginary parts of the wave function at slightly diﬀerent
(“staggered”) times.

In this paper we combine the advances of the last 20 years and extend them to the
numerical solution of the two particle—in contrast to the one particle —time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation. Other than being independent of spin, no assumptions are made re-
garding the functional form of the interaction or initial conditions, and, in particular, there
is no requirement of separation into relative and center-of-mass variables[6]. The method is
simple, explicit, robust, easy to modify, memory preserving, and may have research applica-
tions. However, high precision does require small time and space steps, and, consequently,
long running times. A similar approach for the time-dependent one-particle Schr¨odinger
equation in a two-dimensional space has also been studied [5].

The description of a single particle within a multi-particle system by a single-particle
wave function is an approximation unless the system is uncorrelated (in which case the total
wave function can be written in product form). However, it is possible to deduce meaningful
one-particle densities from the two-particle density by integrating over the other particle:

ρ1(xi, t) =

dxj ρ(x1, x2, t),

Here we use a subscript on the single-particle density ρi to distinguish it from the two-
particle density ρ. Of course, the true solution is ψ(x1, x2, t), but we ﬁnd it hard to see the
physics in a three-variable complex function, and so, often, view ρ1(x1, t) and ρ2(x2, t) as
two separate wavepackets colliding.

If particles 1 and 2 are identical, then their total wave function should be symmetric
or antisymmetric under interchange of the particles. We impose this condition on our

3 Numerical Method

We solve the two-particle Schr¨odinger equation (1) via a ﬁnite diﬀerence method that con-
verts the partial diﬀerential equation into a set of simultaneous, algebraic equations. First,
we evaluate the dependent variable ψ on a grid of discrete values for the independent vari-
ables [2]:

ψ(x1, x2, t) = ψ(x1 = l∆x1, x2 = m∆x2, t = n∆t)

ψn

l,m,

≡

where l, m, and n are integers. The space part of the algorithm is based on Taylor expansions
of ψ(x1, x2, t) in both the x1 and x2 variables up to

(∆x4); for example,

ψ(x1 + ∆x1, x2)

Next, we express the time derivative in (1) in terms of ﬁnite time diﬀerences by taking the
formal solution to the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation and making a forward-diﬀerence
approximation for time evolution operator:

Although simple, this approximation scheme is unstable since the term multiplying ψ has
iE∆t) and modulus √1 + E2∆t2, and this means the modulus of the wave
eigenvalue (1
function increases with each time step [3]. The improvement introduced by Askar and
Cakmak [7] is a central diﬀerence algorithm also based on the formal solution (11):

where we have assumed ∆x1 = ∆x2 and formed the ratio λ = ∆t/∆x2.

Equation (13) is an explicit solution in which the wave function at only two past time
values must be stored simultaneously in memory to determine all future times by continued
iteration. In contrast, an implicit solution determines the wave function for all future times

in just one step, yet this one step requires the solution of simultaneous algebraic equations
involving all space and time values. Accordingly, an implicit solution requires the inversion
of exceedingly large (

1010) matrices.

While the explicit method (13) produces a solution which is stable and second-order
accurate in time, in practice, it does not conserve probability well. Visscher[8] has deduced
an improvement which takes advantage of the extra degree of freedom provided by the
complexity of the wave function to preserve probability better.

4 Simulations

We assume that the particle–particle potential is central and depends only on the relative
distance between particles 1 and 2 (the method can handle any x1 and x2 functional de-
pendences). We have investigated a “soft” potential with a Gaussian dependence, and a
“hard” one with a square-well dependence, both with range α and depth V0:

We model a scattering experiment in which particle 1, initially at x0
collides with particle 2, initially far away at x0
of independent wavepackets for particles 1 and 2:

1 with momentum k1,
2 with momentum k2, by assuming a product

), we would obtain
momentum eigenstates. Note, that while the Schr¨odinger equation may separate into one
equation in the relative coordinate x and another in the center-of-mass coordinate X, the
initial condition (21), or more general ones, cannot be written as separate conditions on x
and X. Accordingly, a solution of the equation in each particle coordinate is required [6].

If the wavepacket is made very broad (σ

We start the staggered-time algorithm with the real part the wave function (21) at t = 0
and the imaginary part at t = ∆t/2. The initial imaginary part follows by assuming that
∆t/2 is small enough, and σ large enough, for the initial time dependence of the wavepacket
to be that of the plane wave parts:

In a scattering experiment, the projectile enters from inﬁnity and the scattered particles
are observed at inﬁnity. We model that by solving our partial diﬀerential equation within
a box of side L (ideally) much larger than both the range of the potential and the width of
the initial wavepacket. This leads to the boundary conditions

ψ(0, x2, t) = ψ(x1, 0, t) = ψ(L, x2, t) = ψ(x1, L, t) = 0.

(23)

The largeness of the box minimizes the eﬀects of the boundary conditions during the collision
of the wavepackets, although at large times there will be interesting, yet artiﬁcial, collisions
with the box.

Some typical parameters used in our tests are given in Table 1 (the code with sample
ﬁles are available on the on Web [9]). Our space step size ∆x = 0.001 is 1/1, 400th of
the size of the box L, and 1/70th of the size (√2σ
0.07) of the wavepacket. Our time
≃
10−7 is 1/20, 000th of the total time T , and 1/2, 000th of a typical time
step ∆t = 2.5
10−4]. In all cases, the potential and wavepacket
for the wavepacket [2π/(k2
parameters are chosen to be similar to those used in the one-particle studies by Goldberg
et al.. The time and space step sizes were determined by trial and error until values were
found which provided stability and precision (too large a ∆x leads to spurious ripples
during interactions). In general, stability is obtained by making ∆t small enough [8], with
simultaneous changes in ∆t and ∆x made to keep λ = ∆t/∆x2 constant. Total probability,
as determined by a double Simpson’s-rule integration of (4), is typically conserved to 13
decimal places, impressively close to machine precision. In contrast, the mean energy, for
which we do not use a deﬁnition optimized to staggered times, is conserved only to 3 places.

4.2 Barrier-Like Collisions

k1 (particle
We solve our problem in the center-of-momentum system by taking k2 =
1 moving to larger x values and particle 2 to smaller x). Our ﬁrst simulations and Web
animations [9] emulate the one-particle collisions with barriers and wells studied by Goldberg
et al. and presented by Schiﬀ. We make particle 2 ten times heavier than particle 1, so that
particle 2’s initial wavepacket moves at 1/10th the speed of particle 1’s, and so looks like
a barrier. Although we shall describe several scattering events, the animations available on
the Web speak for themselves, and we recommend their viewing.

−

In Fig. 2 we show six frames from an animation of the two-particle density ρ(x1, x2, t)
as a simultaneous function of the particle positions x1 and x2.
In Fig. 3 we show, for
this same collision, the single-particle densities ρ1(x = x1, t) and ρ2(x = x2, t) extracted
from ρ(x1, x2, t) by integrating out the dependence on the other particle via (5). Since the
mean energy equals twice the maximum height of the potential barrier, we expect complete
penetration of the packets, and indeed, at time 18 we see that the wavepackets have large
overlap, with the repulsive interaction “squeezing” particle 2 (it gets narrower and taller).
During times 22–40 we see part of wavepacket 1 reﬂecting oﬀ wavepacket 2 and then moving
back to smaller x (the left). From times 26–55 we also see that a major part of wavepacket
1 gets “trapped” inside of wavepacket 2 and then leaks out rather slowly.

We see that for times 1–26, the x2 position of the peak of ρ(x1, x2, t) in Fig. 2 changes
In contrast, the
very little with time, which is to be expected since particle 2 is heavy.
x1 dependence in ρ(x1, x2, t) gets broader with time, develops into two peaks at time 26,
separates into two distinct parts by time 36, and then, at time 86 after reﬂecting oﬀ the
walls, returns to particle 2’s position. We also notice in both these ﬁgures, that at time
40 and thereafter, particle 2 (our “barrier” ) ﬁssions and there are two peaks in the x2
dependence.

As this comparison of Figures 2 and 3 demonstrates, it seems easier to understand the

physics by superimposing two single-particle densities (thereby discarding information on
correlations) than by examining the two-particle density. Accordingly, the ﬁgures we show
hence, and the majority of the animations on the Web, are of single-particle densities.

Fig. 3 is similar to the behavior present in Schiﬀ’s one-particle simulation, Fig. 1, but
without ripples during the collision. Those ripples are caused by interference between
scattered and incident wave, and even though we have a square barrier potential acting
between the particles, neither particle “feels” the discontinuity of the sharp potential edge
at any one time. However, there are ripples when our wavepackets hit the walls, as seen at
times 55 and 150. (There is also a ripple at time 36 arising from interference with the small,
reﬂected part of the left edge of 1’s initial wavepacket. This artifact of having particle 1 so
near the left edge of the bounding box can be seen reﬂecting oﬀ the left wall at time 18.)

Something new in Fig. 3, that is not in Schiﬀ, is the delayed “ﬁssion” of the heavier
particle’s wavepacket after time 40 due to repulsion from the reﬂected and transmitted parts
of wavepacket 1. In addition, at time 86 we see that the reﬂected and transmitted parts of
1 have reconstituted themselves into a single but broadened wavepacket, that at time 150
is again being reﬂected from the left wall.

In Fig. 4 we see another m–10m collision. This time there is an attractive interaction
between the particles and again the mean energy equals half the well depth. Even though
the kinetic energy is low, the interaction is attractive and so particle 1 passes through
particle 2. However, some of wavepacket 1 is reﬂected back to the left after the collision,
and, as we see at time 55, the wavepacket for the heavy particle 2 ﬁssions as a consequence
of its attraction to the two parts of wavepacket 1.

Although we do not show them here, on the Web we also display movies of collisions
corresponding to a Gaussian potential acting between the particles. These are much softer
collisions and have behaviors similar to classical particles bouncing oﬀ each other, with
squeezing and broadening of the wavepackets, but little breakup or capture.

4.3 m–m Collisions

In Fig. 5 we show nine frames from the movie of a repulsive m–m collision in which the
mean kinetic energy equals one quarter of the barrier height. The initial packets are seen to
slow down as they approach each other, with their mutual repulsion narrowing and raising
the packets up until the time (50) when they begin to bounce back. The wavepackets at still
later times are seen to retain their shape, with a progressive broadening until they collide
with the walls and break up. As shown on the Web, when the mean energy is raised there
will be both transmitted and reﬂected wave, already seen in Fig. 3 for an m–10m collision.
In Fig. 6 we show nine frames from the movie of an attractive m–m collision in which
the mean energy equals one quarter of the well depth. The initial packets now speed up
as they approach each other, and at time 60 the centers have already passed through each
other. After that, a transmitted and reﬂected wave for each packet is seen to develop (times
66–78). Finally, each packet appears to capture or “pickup” a part of the other packet and
move oﬀ with it (times 110–180).

In Fig. 7 we repeat the collision of Fig. 6, only now for a wave function that has been
antisymmetrized according to (7). The anitsymmetrization is seen to introduce an eﬀective
repulsion into what is otherwise an attraction (compare the two ﬁgures for times 60–66).
Again, some capture of the other wavepacket is noted from times 94 on, only now the internal
captured wavepacket retains its Gaussian-like shape, apparently the result of decreased
interference.

Finally, in Fig. 7 we repeat the collisions of Figures 6 and 7, only now for a wave function
that has been symmetrized according to (7). The symmetrization is seen to introduce an
eﬀective added attraction (compare the three ﬁgures for time 60 which shows the greatest
penetration for the symmetrized case). While there is still capture of the other wavepacket,
the movie gives the clear impression that the wavepackets interchange with each other as a

11

consequence of the symmetrization.

5 Summary and Conclusions

We have assembled and tested a general technique for the numerical solution of the two-
particle, time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. Because the technique is general, applica-
tion to two or three dimensions and for other potentials and initial conditions should be
straightforward. For example, further studies may want to investigate initial conditions
corresponding to bound particles interacting with a surface, or the formation of a molecule
near a surface.

The Goldberg-Schiﬀ’s image (Fig. 1) of a wavepacket interacting with a potential barrier
is still a valuable model for understanding the physics occuring during a particle’s collision.
Here we have extended the level of realism to what a collision between two particles looks
like. In doing so with a simple square-well potential between the two particles, we have
discovered that ﬁssion and particle pickup occur quite often, although the physics may be
quite diﬀerent from that in nuclei. While somewhat of a challenge to understand fully, we
have also provided animations of the behavior of the two-particle density during collisions.
We have placed the animations, source codes, and movie-making instructions on the Web
with the hope that future students will also carry some of these images of the quantum
world with them.

[10] Our animations are animated gifs that can be viewed with any Web browser, or viewed
and controlled with a movie player such as Quick Time. To create them, we have the
C code packets.c output ﬁles of wavefunction data for each time. We plot each data
ﬁle with the Unix program gnuplot to produce one frame, and then convert the plots
to gif ﬁles. We then use gifmerge [12] to merge the frames into an animation. Further
information and instructions for making movies using diﬀerent operating systems and
formats can be found on the Landau Research Group Web pages[9, 11].

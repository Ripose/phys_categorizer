Auxiliary-ﬁeld quantum Monte Carlo calculations of molecular systems
with a Gaussian basis

(Dated: January 21, 2014)

We extend the recently introduced phaseless auxiliary-ﬁeld quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) ap-
proach to any single-particle basis, and apply it to molecular systems with Gaussian basis sets.
QMC methods in general scale favorably with system size, as a low power. A QMC approach with
auxiliary ﬁelds in principle allows an exact solution of the Schr¨odinger equation in the chosen basis.
However, the well-known sign/phase problem causes the statistical noise to increase exponentially.
The phaseless method controls this problem by constraining the paths in the auxiliary-ﬁeld path
integrals with an approximate phase condition that depends on a trial wave function. In the present
calculations, the trial wave function is a single Slater determinant from a Hartree-Fock calculation.
The calculated all-electron total energies show typical systematic errors of no more than a few
milli-Hartrees compared to exact results. At equilibrium geometries in the molecules we studied,
this accuracy is roughly comparable to that of coupled-cluster with single and double excitations
and with non-iterative triples, CCSD(T). For stretched bonds in H2O, our method exhibits better
overall accuracy and a more uniform behavior than CCSD(T).

INTRODUCTION

Obtaining the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation,
even within a ﬁnite Hilbert space, is an important goal
in quantum chemistry and in condensed matter physics,
both in its own right and for calibrating approximate
methods. In quantum chemistry, a variety of approaches
have been developed over the last ﬁfty years, which range
in quality from the mean-ﬁeld Hartree-Fock (HF) to the
exact full conﬁguration interaction (FCI) solution.
In
between these two limits, a hierarchy of approximations
have been developed which improve upon the Hartree-
Fock solution at the expense of increasing computational
cost [1].

The FCI method is quite formidable computationally,
because its cost grows exponentially with the number of
electrons and basis functions. Recently, the density ma-
trix renormalization group (DMRG) approach was intro-
duced as a method to potentially obtain near-FCI quality
solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for quantum chem-
ical Hamiltonians [2–4]. The results so far are promising.
For example, DMRG was applied recently [3] to study
the water molecule using a double-zeta atomic-natural-
orbital (ANO) basis (41 basis functions), which is cur-
rently intractable with FCI.

Among the approximate approaches, coupled cluster
(CC) methods have been the most successful, especially
at equilibrium geometries [5, 6]. However, standard
CC methods are non-variational and their computational
cost grows rather steeply with the system size as well. For
example, the most popular among them, CC with sin-
gle and double excitations and with non-iterative triples
[CCSD(T)], has an N 7 scaling with the size of the basis.
Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are an attrac-
tive means for a non-perturbative and explicit treatment
of the interacting many-fermion system. These methods

tend to have favorable scaling with system size, often as a
low power. The most established QMC method, the real
space ﬁxed-node diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method,
has been applied successfully to calculate many proper-
ties of solids [7] and molecules [8].

The central

Recently, an alternative and complementary QMC
method has been introduced [9] for realistic electronic
Hamiltonians, based on a ﬁeld-theoretic approach with
auxiliary ﬁelds.
idea of auxiliary-ﬁeld
(AF) QMC methods is the mapping of the interacting
many-body problem into a linear combination of non-
interacting problems coupled to external AFs. Averaging
over diﬀerent AF conﬁgurations is performed by Monte
Carlo techniques. The basic formalism of AF QMC meth-
ods has mostly been applied to lattice models of strongly
interacting systems [10, 11]. In these models, the sim-
pliﬁed form of the two-body interactions makes possible
an eﬃcient mapping with real AFs. As a result, “only”
a sign problem [12] occurs. Constrained path methods
[12, 13] have been developed to approximately control
the sign problem, which have been shown to be quite
accurate.

The potential of AF QMC methods for realistic Hamil-
tonians has long been recognized and pursued [14–16].
However, wide and general applications were not real-
ized because of a lack of control for the phase problem.
Except for special cases, the two-body electronic interac-
tions lead to complex AFs. The many-dimensional inte-
gration over complex variables in turn leads to an expo-
nentially increasing noise and therefore breakdown of the
method. The phaseless AF QMC method [9] was intro-
duced to control the phase problem in an approximate
manner.

In Ref. [9], a general framework was developed on how
to use importance sampling of the determinants to deal
with the complex phase. An approximate constraint was

then formulated with a trial wave function to constrain
the paths in AF space and eliminate the growth of noise.
Because of the constraint, the calculated ground state
energy is no longer exact and is not variational. In ap-
plications to several sp-bonded materials [9, 17, 18], it
was shown that the method, with a plane-wave basis and
simple trial wave functions, gave accurate results for sys-
tems from simple atoms to large supercells. The phase-
less AF QMC method was also recently applied to the
strongly correlated transition metal oxide molecules TiO
and MnO [19], again yielding results in good agreement
with experiment using simple mean-ﬁeld trial wave func-
tions.

The success of the phaseless AF approach in solid-state
applications with plane-waves has motivated us to extend
it to a generic one-particle basis, targeting in particu-
lar quantum chemistry problems. Applying the new AF
QMC method to such problems is very appealing, espe-
cially with the integral role basis sets play in quantum
chemistry methods. This method allows QMC calcula-
tions using any choice of one-particle basis. It provides a
framework for general many-body calculations which can
import straightforwardly many of the well-established
technologies from more traditional approaches.
By
importance-sampled random walks, the phaseless AF
QMC method obtains the many-body ground state with
an ensemble of loosely coupled independent-particle cal-
culations which propagate with imaginary-time. The
ground-state wave function is represented by a linear
combination of non-orthogonal Slater determinants.

In this paper we report the ﬁrst results from this ef-
fort. We discuss aspects of the new method when im-
plemented with Gaussian basis sets. We present bench-
mark results on sp-bonded atoms and molecules. All-
electron total energies are calculated for various ﬁrst-
row atoms and molecules, and compared with FCI and
DMRG results where available or with CCSD(T) other-
wise. The behavior of the method is also studied as a
function of basis size, including an ANO basis [20, 21]
in H2O and O2, each with 92 basis functions. We then
test the method away from equilibrium geometries, cal-
culating the equilibrium bond length and also stretching
the bonds in the water molecule by a factor between 1
and 8 within a cc-pVDZ basis [22]. In all our calculations
the trial wave function is taken to be a single Slater de-
terminant from Hartree-Fock, either restricted (RHF) or
unrestricted (UHF). Their eﬀect on the accuracy is exam-
ined. The calculated energies with the optimal HF wave
function typically show systematic errors of no more than
a few milli-Hartree (mEh) compared to exact results. For
stretched bonds in H2O, our method exhibits better over-
all accuracy and more uniform behavior than CCSD(T).
An additional beneﬁt of the present AF QMC imple-
mentation is its value for algorithmic studies. Compared
to the plane-wave algorithm, the generic basis AF QMC
method typically has much more eﬀective basis sets. As
a result, the basis size is often much smaller and the
method is signiﬁcantly cheaper computationally. Fur-

2

ther, direct comparisons can be more easily made be-
tween the QMC results and those obtained with more
established correlated methods, as indicated above. Ex-
tra ingredients such as pseudopotentials can be removed,
with the only remaining uncertainty being the systematic
error from the phaseless approximation. In this study, we
take advantage of this feature to make detailed bench-
mark studies of the systematic error.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
phaseless AF QMC method is ﬁrst brieﬂy reviewed in
the next section. We then describe its implementation
with the Gaussian basis in Sec. III, together with some
results to illustrate the behavior and characteristics of
this approach. Section IV gives some of the details of
the computational procedures. In Sec. V and Sec. VI, we
present the results of our calculations, including calcula-
tions of the H2O molecule both at the equilibrium geom-
etry and with stretched bond lengths, and total energies
and energy diﬀerences (binding, ionization, and electron
aﬃnity) for various other ﬁrst-row atoms and diatomic
molecules. Finally in Sec. VII we make concluding re-
marks, together with a brief discussion of possibilities for
further improvement of the new algorithm.

where the one-body operators ˆvα can be deﬁned gener-
ally for any two-body operator by writing the latter in
a quadratic form, such as ˆH2 =

a real number. Monte Carlo methods are very eﬃcient
at evaluating multi-dimensional integrals as in Eq. (4).
For example, the projection of Eq. (2) can be realized
iteratively: An ensemble of Slater determinants
are initialized to the trial wave function
then propagated to a new ensemble
of Eq. (3), and so on, until convergence is reached. For
each Slater determinant in the ensemble, the two-body
part in Eq. (4) can be applied stochastically by sampling
. In the standard AF QMC

This straightforward approach, however, will generally
lead to an exponential increase in the statistical ﬂuctu-
ations with the projection time. The source of the ﬂuc-
tuations is that the one-body operators ˆv
are
generally complex, since usually ζα cannot all be made

We used the phaseless auxiliary-ﬁeld QMC method to
control the phase problem.
In order to implement a
phaseless constraint, the method recasts the imaginary-

IMPLEMENTATION USING A LOCALIZED

BASIS

With Gaussian basis sets, the matrix elements of inter-
est to QMC and the overlap matrix can be imported from
quantum chemistry programs. It is more convenient to
use orthonormal basis functions, which ensure the usual
commutation relations of the creation and destruction
operators. To set up the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1), we ﬁrst
transform the non-orthogonal basis into an orthogonal-
ized basis set. The one- and two-body matrix elements,
Tij and Vijkl, are then expressed with respect to this ba-
sis via the transformation, based on the original matrix
elements.

To carry out the HS transformation of Eq. (4), we ﬁrst
map the two-body interaction matrix Vijkl into a sym-

The two-body operator ˆH2 of Eq. (1) can be written
as the sum of a one-body operator ˆH ′1 and a two-body
operator ˆH ′2. The latter can be further expressed in terms
of the eigenvectors of

In this case the number of the HS ﬁelds is equal to twice
the number of non-zero eigenvalues (
λα) of the sym-
metrized two-body supermatrix. Other forms of decom-
position and HS transformation are possible, and their
eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness with a constraint can vary.
For example, using a modiﬁed Cholesky decomposition
will eliminate the need to diagonalize the supermatrix
and potentially reduces the computational cost of syn-
thesizing the matrix. However, this will generally lead
to a larger number of HS ﬁelds, and hence increase the
QMC computational cost. We will defer further analysis
of this freedom to a future publication.

To illustrate the method, we use the H2O molecule in a
minimal STO-6G basis. This problem is small enough to
permit detailed comparison with exact diagonalization.

Starting from the HF trial wave function, the total energy is

the free projection QMC (exact but suﬀers from the phase
problem) and the phaseless approximation. For comparison,
we show also the exact projection which is obtained form di-
agonalization of the many-body Hamiltonian. The phaseless
QMC method tracks smoothly the exact projection with no
sign of the uncontrolled ﬂuctuations in free projection.

both QMC methods show essentially the same conver-
gence of the total-energy. For large projection times, the
free-projection starts showing the phase problem in the
form of large ﬂuctuations. Around β
these
ﬂuctuations diverge on the scale of the plot. For larger
number of particles or larger basis sets, this divergence
would have occurred at much earlier projection times β.

act projection with ﬁnite variance as the random walk
proceeds.

Similar results and analysis have also been presented
in phaseless AF QMC calculations in boson systems [24].
We comment that the issue in Fig. 2 is diﬀerent from
the shifted contour approach [15], dispite formal similar-
ities. With the importance sampling scheme of Ref. [9],
Eqs. (5) and (7) would both be exact and give the same
results under free projection, since the mean-ﬁeld shift is
automatically applied via the importance sampling trans-
formation regardless of which form of ˆH ′2 is used [25].
The diﬀerent behaviors discussed above arise only be-
cause of the imposition of the phase projection to one-
dimension [9], in which the substraction of the mean-ﬁeld
background helps to reduce the “rotation” of the random
-plane and thus the sever-

ity of the projection.

IV. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

The above method was applied to several atomic
and molecular systems, which were chosen primarily for

benchmarking purposes and which have all been previ-
ously studied using well-established correlated methods
such as coupled cluster (CC), full conﬁguration inter-
action (FCI), or density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) methods.
In these and in our QMC calcula-
tions, the core and valence electrons are fully correlated.
All the QMC calculations reported below used a single
Hartree-Fock Slater determinant as the trial wave func-
tion. For all systems, QMC was done with the best
variational single determinant, namely the unrestricted
Hartree-Fock (UHF) solution. In addition, we have also
tested the restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) solution as the
trial wave function in some cases. No additional opti-
mization or tuning of the trial wave function was per-
formed beyond the mean-ﬁeld Hartree-Fock calculation.
The QMC code is interfaced with GAMESS[26] and
NWChem[27] to import the Gaussian one-electron and
two-electron matrix elements, the overlap matrix, and
the trial wave function. All of our calculations are done
using the spherical harmonics representation of basis
functions.

We performed the FCI calculations using MOL-
PRO [28, 29] and the coupled cluster calcuations using
NWChem [27]. Unless otherwise noted, the coupled clus-
ter calculations for atoms and molecules with a singlet
state are of the type RHF-RCCSD(T) i.e. based on the
RHF reference state, while those for a multiplet state are
of the unrestricted type, UHF-UCCSD(T) based on the
UHF solution.

V. EQUILIBRIUM GEOMETRIES

As a ﬁrst test of our method, we calculate in this sec-
tion total energies and binding energies for some well-
studied systems at their equilibrium geometries. The
ﬁrst subsection contains results for the water molecule
in the vicinity of the equilibrium structure and the O2
dimer at equilibrium bond length. The second subsection
contains results for other ﬁrst-row atoms and diatomic
molecules, including total ground-state energies, binding
energy, convergence with basis sets, atomic ionization po-
tentials, and electron aﬃnities. In the next section, we
test the method by studying bond stretching of the water
molecule.

A. H2O and O2

The water molecule has a long benchmarking history
[3, 30–33]. Table I presents results calculated by HF,
CCSD(T), FCI, and the present QMC method. We show
the all-electron total energies of the individual atoms
H and O, and the total and binding energies of H2O.
Four diﬀerent basis sets were used: minimal STO-6G, cc-
pVDZ [22], and the double zeta (DZ) and triple-zeta (TZ)
ANO bases of Widmark, Malmqvist, and Roos [20, 21].

For H2O, these have 7, 24, 41, and 92 basis functions, re-
spectively. The H2O geometries were as follows: results
using the minimal STO-6G correspond to positions (in
Bohr) of O(0, 0, 0) and H(0,
1.058898) with
±
C2v symmetry, while the cc-pVDZ results used the ge-
ometry of Ref. [32]. The DZ ANO and TZ ANO results
were obtained with the geometry given in Ref. [3].

1.515263,

−

The QMC calculations used UHF trial wave functions.
(For H2O, the RHF and UHF solutions are identical at
the equilibrium bond length.) The FCI total energies of
H2O/cc-pVDZ are those of Ref. [32]. FCI results for H2O
are not within reach for the DZ ANO basis, but DMRG
results are available from a recent study [3], which are
shown under FCI. The FCI energy of O/DZ ANO is also
from Ref. [3]. Neither FCI nor DMRG is within reach
presently for the TZ ANO basis.

We see that

the agreement between the QMC,
CCSD(T), and FCI results is quite good. As mentioned,
the calculated ground-state energies in the present phase-
less QMC method are not variational, which can be seen
in the results in H2O, for example. QMC binding energy
results of H2O overestimate the exact values by 0.4(1),
2.7(2), 4.4(6) mEh, for the STO-6G, cc-pVDZ, and DZ
ANO basis, respectively. The CCSD(T) method, which
is highly accurate at this geometry, has errors of 0.06,
0.47, 0.48 mEh, respectively.
In the TZ ANO basis,
CCSD(T) and QMC yield binding energies of 0.3675 and
0.373(1) Eh, respectively.

As mentioned, the DZ ANO and TZ ANO calcula-
tions of H2O were for the geometry in Ref. [3]. Using
CCSD(T), we veriﬁed that the experimental H2O geom-
etry would lower the molecular total energy by 2.7 mEh
and 4.0 mEh for the two basis sets. This would increase
the binding energy by the same amount, and bring the
CCSD(T) binding energy with the TZ ANO basis to good
agreement with 0.370 Eh, the basis extrapolated value of
Feller and Peterson [34]. For comparison, the experimen-
tal binding energy of H2O is 0.3707 Eh (with the zero-
point energy removed) [34].

Figure 3 shows a comparison of QMC and CCSD(T) re-
sults in the vicinity of the H2O equilibrium bond length,
using cc-pVDZ and ANO double zeta basis sets. The an-
gle between the two O-H bonds is ﬁxed at the experimen-
tal angle of 104.4798 degrees, and we varied R/Re where

6

Re = 1.81 Bohr is the experimental bond length [35]. For
the cc-pVDZ basis, the CCSD(T) and QMC equilibrium
bond lengths calculated from these curves are 1.007 Re
and 1.007(2) Re, respectively. The corresponding values
using the ANO DZ basis set are 1.003 Re and 1.006(4) Re.
We present results for the O2 molecule in Table II. The
experimental equilibrium bond length of Re = 1.2074 ˚A
is used for all of these calculations. Results are shown
for the three larger basis sets used in the above H2O cal-
culations. These include the cc-pVDZ and the DZ and
TZ ANO basis sets, which give 28, 46, and 92 basis func-
tions for O2, respectively. QMC and CCSD(T) results
are again in good agreement.
In the TZ ANO basis,
the CCSD(T) and QMC binding energies are 0.188 and
0.192(2) Eh, respectively. Our QMC value is in excellent
agreement with our previous binding energy 0.191(4) cal-
culated using pseudopotentials and planewaves [19]. Also
for comparison, the basis extrapolated binding energy
at the CCSD(T) level is 0.191 Eh and the experimental
value is 0.192 Eh (with the zero-point energy removed)
[34].

B. First-row atoms and diatomic molecules

1. All-electron total ground-state energies

In Table III, we show the total energies of various
ﬁrst-row atoms and diatomic molecules at the equilib-
rium geometry. For comparison, we show the RHF, UHF,
CCSD(T), and also the FCI energies where available. For
singlets where both UHF and RHF solutions exist, QMC
calculations were done with each as a trial wave function,
and both results are shown in the last two columns. In
such cases, QMC with the best variational single Slater
determinant as trial wave function, namely QMC/UHF,
appears to always give better energy values. We discuss
this eﬀect further in Sec.VI with stretched bonds in H2O.
Our QMC energies are generally within a few mEh of
the FCI or the CCSD(T) energies.
It is interesting to
note the cases of the berylium atom and molecule. The
Be atom, which has a near 2s-2p degeneracy, has often
been used as a benchmark in Green’s function or diﬀusion
Monte Carlo (DMC) studies [37, 38]. Optimized Slater-
Jastrow trial wave functions with a single determinant
10 mEh,
are known to lead to signiﬁcant errors, of
in the calculated ﬁxed-node ground-state energy [37].
(This error is largely removed when multi-determinant
trial wave functions are used to account for the near de-
generacy. For example, DMC with an optimized Slater-
Jastrow trial wave function using four determinants is
extremely accurate [37].) In the present QMC method,
the phaseless approximation using a single Slater deter-
minant appears to be signiﬁcantly less dependent on the
1 mEh or
trial wave function, with systematic errors of
less. Of course, the DMC calculations work in real conﬁg-
uration space and thus have the advantage of no ﬁnite-
basis errors. Measured as a fraction of the correlation

energy, the present QMC/UHF still has a substantially
smaller systematic error, of about 2% in Be/cc-pVTZ.

∼

Correspondingly, the Be2 dimer is a notorious case in
quantum chemistry [39]. A DMC calculation using op-
timized single-determinant trial wave functions did not
obtain binding [40]. Our QMC/UHF total energies are
within
2 mEh of CCSD(T), and the resulting binding
energy with the larger cc-pVTZ basis is 5.5(4) mEh, in
good agreement with the CCSD(T) value of 6.1 mEh.
The ﬁnite basis-size errors are still signiﬁcant at this ba-
sis size — at the CCSD(T) level, the binding energy is
3.6 mEh with the cc-pVQZ basis and 4.2 mEh with the
cc-pV5Z basis. Thus a more detailed study is necessary
before a direct and deﬁnitive comparison can be made be-
tween QMC and experiment (BE: 4.0 mEh). The QMC
result is consistent with the previous calculation using a
plane-wave basis [9], which should be at the inﬁnite basis
limit (aside from pseudopotential errors).

2.

Ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities

In Tables IV and V we present a summary of the cal-
culated ﬁrst ionization potential and electron aﬃnity for
ﬁrst-row elements. For the ionization energy study, we
used the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ double- and triple-zeta
basis sets [22] for all the elements. A few selected el-
ements are then studied, using the larger cc-pVQZ ba-
sis sets. Also we looked at O with a cc-pV5Z basis
set with 91 basis functions. For the electron aﬃnity
we used the aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ sets [43].
For comparison, we show the values calculated using HF,
CCSD(T), and QMC, as well as the experimental data

from Refs. [41, 42].

The agreement between QMC and the coupled cluster
CCSD(T) results is in general very good. For unstable
or meta-stable negative ions (N− and Ne−), the Hamil-
tonian expressed with a localized basis always yields an
atomic-like ground state. In Tables IV and V, the total
ground-state energies are not shown, but the mean dif-
ference between the QMC and CCSD(T) values among
all the atoms and ions is less than 3 mEh. The negative
charged F ion, F−/aug-cc-pVTZ, has the largest discrep-
ancy of
7 mEh. An MCSCF study [27] showed that the
RHF single determinant gives a rather poor description
of the ion.

VI. H2O BOND STRETCHING

We next examine the accuracy of our method in de-
scribing bond stretching. The ability of a computa-
tional method to deliver uniform accuracy as bonds are
stretched/broken is obviously important in chemistry. It
also provides an indicator for the potential accuracy of a
method for solids, mimicking diﬀerent levels of electron
correlation. Our method uses a trial wave function in
the constraint to deal with the phase problem. Almost
all calculations to date, both with the plane-wave basis
and in the present study, have used single Slater deter-
minant trial wave functions. Since the quality of such
wave functions decreases as bonds are stretched and cor-
relation eﬀects become more important, it is a signiﬁcant
challenge for the method to maintain its quality and ob-
tain uniformly accurate results.

We apply our method to stretched bonds in H2O,

ments as calculated in the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets.
For selected elements, additional cc-pVQZ and cc-pV5Z ba-
sis sets are also used. We show the values obtained using
HF, CCSD(T), and QMC, together with experimental results
[41, 42]. QMC statistical errors are in the last digit and are
shown in parentheses. All energies are in eV.

the two larger basis sets, we used the same geometries as
those of Ref. [32] and Ref. [3] for comparison with their
FCI and DMRG energies, respectively.
The results are shown in Table VI.

In addition to
QMC/UHF, i.e., using the variationally optimal HF so-
lution as the trial wave function, we also carried out
QMC calculations using the RHF solution, in order to
further examine the eﬀect of the trial wave function. As
bonds are stretched, static correlation becomes increas-
ingly important. The RHF solution becomes inceasingly
unfavorable compared to the UHF solution, which has
the correct behavior in the dissociation limit. As can be
seen in Table VI, QMC with the RHF trial wave function
(QMC/RHF) performs worse than QMC/UHF, which is
consistent with the trend seen in Table III. Indeed, the
QMC/RHF results deterioate as the bonds are stretched,
reﬂecting the qualitatively incorrect nature of the RHF
trial wave function at large bond lengths.

In the range of bond lengths in Table VI, QMC with
the UHF trial wave function gives roughly comparable
accuracy as CCSD(T). For example, in the cc-pVDZ ba-
sis at 1.5 Re, QMC/UHF over-estimates the energy by
2.7(1) mEh, while CCSD(T) over-estimates it by 1.6 mEh.
At 2 Re, both QMC/UHF and CCSD(T) under-estimate
the energy, by 3.0(2) and 3.8 mEh, respectively. In the
DZ ANO basis for 1.5 Re, QMC/UHF is above the
DMRG value by 2.1(5) mEh, while CCSD(T) is above
by 1.6 mEh.

Larger bond stretching of up to 8 Re is presented in
Figure 4, using the cc-pVDZ valence double-zeta basis.
QMC results are compared with exact FCI [32] and with
coupled cluster results using RHF and UHF reference
states (CCSD(T) and UCCSD(T), respectively). The in-
set shows the errors of the various methods from the FCI
numbers. CCSD(T) is excellent near equilibrium, but
is much worse at large bond lengths.
(As mentioned,
QMC with RHF trial wave functions would show similar
behavior at large bond lengths.) UCCSD(T) performs
much better for larger bond lengths, but is worse in the
intermediate regime with errors larger than 10 mEh. Our
QMC results are in good agreement with the exact ener-
gies, showing a maximum discrepancy of about 4(1) mEh,
which occurs at 8Re. Together with the equilibrium re-
sults, the method is seen to yield rather uniform accuracy
across these bond lengths. This is encouraging, given
that it is achieved with the same choice, namely the vari-
ational UHF solution, as the trial wave function through-
out the entire region.

VII. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

which has served as an excellent benchmark system
[3, 32]. Symmetric O-H bond length stretching is stud-
ied. The bond angle between the two O-H bonds is held
ﬁxed, while the O-H bond length is increased from its
equilibrium value. We considered three diﬀerent basis
sets: STO-6G, cc-pVDZ [22], and DZ ANO [20]. For the
small basis, we used the same geometry as in Table I. For

The present QMC method provides an approximate,
but non-perturbative approach for many-electron calcu-
lations. It can directly incorporate traditional electronic-
structure machinery, such as high-quality basis sets,
eﬀective-core potentials, etc. The method obtains the
many-body ground state by building a stochastic linear

FIG. 4: A comparison of bond stretching in H2O/cc-pVDZ
between the present QMC, coupled cluster methods, and
FCI [32]. The main graph shows the calculated total energy
(in Hartrees) as a function of the O-H bond length. The in-
set shows the errors (in milli-Hartrees) of various methods
with respect to FCI. Points are connected by straight lines
for clarity. QMC statistical error bars are shown.

The accuracy of the present QMC method depends on
the reference or trial wave function
, which in this
study is chosen as the HF state. As in coupled cluster
methods, the trial wave function is the starting point
of the ground-state projection, but in QMC all excita-
tions are implicitly included by the projection. Errors
arise from the phaseless approximation in the projection,
to approximate the phase of the contri-
which uses
bution of a Slater determinant to the ground state, via
the importance-sampling transformation.

We have found, as shown in Tables III and VI, that

the most accurate energies are in general obtained us-
ing the best variational single determinant
. This
is simply the HF solution when RHF and UHF are the
same (e.g., in the H2O molecule at equilibrium), and is
the UHF solution when the two diﬀer. In the latter case,
the method seems relatively insensitive, within the unre-
stricted framework, to whether a Hartree-Fock or hybrid
B3LYP Slater determinant is used.

In contrast to the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
method, the present QMC must deal with ﬁnite basis-set
errors and basis-size convergence. However, the ability
to use any single-particle basis can also be advantageous.
For example, in addition to the connection to quantum
chemistry methods, our new method also makes possi-
ble QMC calculations for general model Hamiltonians,
which are frequently used in the study of correlated elec-
tron systems. Like the present AF QMC method, DMC is
also approximate, using a trial wave function to impose
the ﬁxed-node approximation to control the sign prob-
lem. The trial wave functions that have been used in our
method are much simpler. Because of the complementary
nature of the two diﬀerent methods, direct comparisons
are not always straightforward. Indications from the cur-
rent calculations and earlier plane-wave studies are that
the systematic accuracy of the phaseless approximation
compare favorably with ﬁxed-node DMC.

In summary, we extended the recently introduced
phaseless QMC method to handle any one-particle basis,
and applied it to atoms and molecules using Gaussian ba-
sis sets. Overall, our results at and near the equilibrium
geometries are roughly comparable to those obtained us-
ing CCSD(T), but are superior for bond stretching. Our
preliminary results (to be published elsewhere) on bond-
breaking in several diatomic molecules show similar uni-
form accuracy. For a ﬁrst application, these results are
quite encouraging. There are many possibilities for fur-
ther improvement of the method. Currently, we are inves-
tigating diﬀerent forms of Hubbard-Stratonovich trans-
formations, possibilities for better scaling, as well as ap-
plications of the present method in transition metal ox-

ides and other systems.

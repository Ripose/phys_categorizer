Abstract. The two-dimensional n-body problem of classical mechanics is a non-
integrable Hamiltonian system for n > 2. Traditional numerical integration algorithms,
which are polynomials in the time step, typically lead to systematic drifts in the
computed value of the total energy and angular momentum. Even symplectic
integration schemes exactly conserve only an approximate Hamiltonian. We present
an algorithm that conserves the true Hamiltonian and the total angular momentum to
machine precision. It is derived by applying conventional discretizations in a new space
obtained by transformation of the dependent variables. We develop the method ﬁrst
for the restricted circular three-body problem, then for the general two-dimensional
three-body problem, and ﬁnally for the planar n-body problem. Jacobi coordinates
are used to reduce the two-dimensional n-body problem to an (n − 1)-body problem
that incorporates the constant linear momentum and center of mass constraints. For
the n-body problem, we ﬁnd that a larger time step can be used with our conservative
algorithm than with symplectic and conventional integrators.

An Exactly Conservative Integrator for the n-Body Problem

1. Introduction

The n-body problem is the study of motion of n arbitrary particles in space according
to the Newtonian law of gravitation. When n = 2 (the Kepler problem), the problem
has a well-known analytic solution, but Poincar´e has shown that the system is in general
non-integrable for n > 2. To approximately solve these cases, one often attempts to
discretize the equations of motion and study the evolution of the system numerically.
However, discretization of a system of any diﬀerential equations typically leads to a loss
of accuracy; ﬁrst integrals of the motion may no longer be preserved and the phase
portrait may become inaccurate. This often necessitates the use of small time steps, so
that many iterations will be required. In this article, we demonstrate that conservative
integration can be used to obtain an accurate picture of the dynamics even with a
relatively large time step.

Conservative integration was introduced by Shadwick, Bowman, and Morrison
[1, 2, 3]. These authors argued that a more robust and faithful evolution of the dynamics
can be obtained by explicitly building in knowledge of the analytical structure of the
equations; in this case, by preserving the known ﬁrst integrals of the motion. They
illustrated the method applied to a three-wave truncation of the Euler equations, the
Lotka–Volterra problem, and the Kepler Problem. In this work, we extend the method
to the equations of motion of n bodies in space, ﬁrst to the circular restricted three-body
problem, then to the general three-body problem, and ﬁnally to the full n-body case.
For simplicity we only consider two-dimensional motion (a reasonable assumption for
all of the planets in the solar system except for Pluto); extending this work to three
dimensions should be straightforward.

2. Conservative Integration

The equations describing the motion of the solar system form a conservative system: the
friction that heavenly bodies sustain is so small that virtually no energy is lost. Both
the total energy and total angular momentum are conserved. We argue that a robust
integration algorithm should preserve both of these invariants.

One way to accomplish this is to transform the dependent variables to a new space
where the energy and other conserved quantities are linear functions of the transformed
variables, apply a traditional integration algorithm in this space, and then transform
back to get new values for each variable [1, 2]. This approach is motivated by the
following lemma.

Lemma 1 Let x and c be vectors in Rn. If f : Rn+1 → Rn is orthogonal to c, so that
I = c · x is a linear invariant of the ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation d
dtx = f (t, x), then
each stage of the explicit m-stage discretization

xj = x0 + τ

j = 1 . . . m,

also conserves I, where τ is the time step and bjk ∈ R. That is, c · xj = c · x0, for all
j = 1, . . . , m.

Proof. Since c · f = 0, we have

c · xj = c · x0 + τ

bjkc · f (t + ajτ, xk) = c · x0,

j = 1 . . . m.

⋄

For example, given a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations dx

dt = f (t, x), consider

the second-order predictor–corrector (2-stage) scheme

˜x = x0 + τ f (t, x0),

x(t + τ ) = x0 +

[f (t, x0) + f (t + τ, ˜x)],

(2a)

(2b)

where we now write ˜x instead of x1. In the conservative predictor–corrector algorithm,
one seeks a transformation ξ = T (x) of the dependent variable x such that the quantities
to be conserved can be expressed as linear functions of the new variables ξi, i = 1, . . . , n.
Then, keeping Eq. (2a) as the predictor, in the transformed space one applies the
corrector

ξ(t + τ ) = ξ0 +

[T ′

(x)f (t, x0) + T ′

(˜x)f (t + τ, ˜x)],

(3)

where ˜ξ(t) = T ( ˜x) and T ′ is the derivative of T . The new value of x is obtained
by inverse transformation, x(t + τ ) = T −1(ξ(t + τ )). Often the inverse transformation
involves radicals, and if the argument of the radical is negative, it is still possible to use a
ﬁnite number of smaller time-step reductions to integrate the system [2]; this approach
is particularly advantageous when the time step is chosen adaptively. Another way
to deal with negative arguments is to switch to a conventional integrator (predictor–
corrector) for that one time step.
If the inverse transformation involves several
branches (e.g. because of a square root), the correct branch can be distinguished to
suﬃcient accuracy using the conventional predictor solution. Higher-order conservative
integration algorithms are readily obtained in the same way, by coupling the ﬁrst m − 1
“predictor” stages from Eq. (1) with the conservative corrector

ξ(t + τ ) = ξ0 + τ

j = 1 . . . m.

According to Iserles [4], a major drawback of traditional non-conservative
integration is that numbers are often “thrown into the computer.” Mathematical models
are often discretized according to algorithms that have little to do with the original
problem. Iserles argued that one should develop computational algorithms that reﬂect
known structural features of the problem under consideration (e.g. see [5, 6]). The
conservative predictor–corrector is an example of such an integrator. In the examples
given by [1, 3], the transformation T is tailored to the system at hand; there is obviously
no generic transformation that can be used to integrate an arbitrary conservative system.

It is interesting to compare conservative integration (which conserves the value of
the Hamiltonian) with symplectic integration (which conserves phase-space volume; e.g.,
see Refs. [7], [8], and [9]). According to Ge and Marsden (1988), if an integrator is both
symplectic and conservative, it must be exact. Normally we do not have the luxury of
having an exact discretization at our disposal. The drawback then with conservative
integration is that the Hamiltonian phase-space structure will not be preserved, just
as for symplectic integration the total energy will not conserved. Which method is
preferable depends on the physical structure of the problem being investigated.

Another important advantage of conservative integration algorithms is that, unlike
typical symplectic integration schemes, they are explicit. Although in some cases the
inverse of the transformation T may be deﬁned by an implicit equation that requires
iteration to solve (using the predicted value as an accurate initial guess), this is really
nothing more than a special function evaluation; the time-stepping scheme itself, being
causal, is explicit.

With conservative integration, one can get all of the known invariants of the n-body
problem conserved exactly, even for large time steps. This can lead to a more accurate
picture of the motion of the bodies [1, ﬁgure 9] for the same computational eﬀort. In
the next section, we motivate the extension of the method of conservative integration to
the n-body problem by brieﬂy revisiting the treatment of the Kepler problem in Ref. [1].

3. Kepler Problem

The Kepler problem describes the motion of two bodies m1 and m2 located at positions
r1 and r2, respectively. The dynamics can be reduced to an equivalent one-body
problem, the behaviour of a single particle of mass m = m1m2/(m1 + m2) at the
position r = r2 − r1 under the inﬂuence of a central gravitational force. This force
may be expressed as the gradient of the potential function V = −k/r, where k is the
gravitational constant. The equations of motion can be written in terms of the radial
velocity vr and the polar coordinate angle θ of the particle,

To set the framework for generalizing the two-body problem to the n-body problem, we
slightly generalize the presentation in Ref. [1] to make the constant ℓ a variable that is
formally integrated, but which remains constant.

The predictor step of the conservative integrator is given by Eq. (2a), where
x = (r, θ, p, ℓ). To derive the corrector, the vector (r, p, ℓ) is transformed to (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3),
where

Before generalizing the integrator of Shadwick et al. to the n-body problem, it is

instructive to consider ﬁrst the special case of the restricted three-body problem.

4. Restricted Three-Body Problem

Suppose that two bodies of masses m1 and m2, called the primaries, revolve around their
center of mass in circular orbits. The circular restricted three-body problem describes the
motion of a third body, with a mass m3 that is negligible compared to m1 and m2, at
coordinates (x, y) in the plane of motion of the other two bodies. The third body does
not inﬂuence the motion of the other two. The derivation of the equations of motion
for the restricted problem is described in [11]. The Hamiltonian is given by

We used the same initial conditions as in Ref. [12]. In Fig. 1, the motion of the third
body is plotted in the ﬁxed frame, using a time step τ = 0.0015 from time t = 0 to
t = 17.1. The orbit for the predictor–corrector begins to converge to the large time-
step orbit shown for the conservative predictor–corrector as the time step is reduced to
τ = 0.001.

This example assumes that the mass of one body is negligible to the other two
masses, and that the other two masses are travelling in circular orbits. The rest of this
paper discusses the general case of three or more bodies: no restrictions are placed on
the masses of the bodies, and their orbits do not have to be circular, or even periodic.

5. General Three-Body Problem

The derivation of the equations of motion of the general three-body problem in a plane
is described in Refs. [11], [13], and [14].

Given three bodies m1, m2, and m3 with position vectors r1, r2, and r3, where
each ri is at location (xi, yi), deﬁne rij = rj − ri, where i, j = 1, 2, 3. The potential is

to Jacobi coordinates (e.g., see Refs. [15], [16], and [17]). The remaining constraints of
constant total angular momentum and energy are built into the conservative integrator,
by transforming to a frame where these invariants are linear.

Letting r = r2 − r1 = (rx, ry), M = m1 + m2 + m3, and µ = m1 + m2, the
location of the center of mass of m1 and m2 is seen to be at µ−1(m1r1 + m2r2), or, since
m1r1 + m2r2 + m3r3 = 0, at −µ−1m3r3. Let ρ = (ρx, ρy) be the vector from the center
of mass of the ﬁrst two bodies to the third body. Then ρ = r3 + µ−1m3r3 = Mµ−1r3

r2 − r1 = r,

In Fig. 2 we compare the predictor–corrector and conservative predictor–corrector
solutions for the motion of one of the three unit masses, using the initial conditions
determined by Sim´o [18] and cited in [19], with a ﬁxed time step of τ = 6.5 × 10−5. Each
mass travels once around the ﬁgure eight. As τ is decreased, the predictor–corrector
solution begins to look more like that of the (large time step) conservative predictor–
corrector; when τ = 5.1 × 10−5, the two graphs become identical in appearance. This
emphasizes that the conservative predictor–corrector can be viewed as a ﬁnite-time-step
generalization of the conventional predictor–corrector, as argued in Ref. [1].

We now extend above results to the n-body case, where n ≥ 2.

In Fig. 3, we illustrate the four-body choreography described by Sim´o [18]. The
motions of one of the four unit masses, as predicted by the predictor–corrector and
conservative predictor–corrector, are compared, using the ﬁxed time step τ = 10−3 to
integrate the system from time t = 0 to t = 10 . For the same time step, we also
compare these solutions to a second-order symplectic mapping with kinetic–potential
energy splitting using Varadi’s NBI code. Of the three solutions, we note that the
conservative predictor–corrector trajectory is the most accurate. It was also found to
be more accurate than the second-order Wisdom–Holman scheme described by Varadi
[20, 21].

7. Conclusion

Conservative integration algorithms can reduce the computational eﬀort required to
integrate a system of equations accurately. When the total energy and angular
momentum of the n-body problem is conserved,
it is possible to obtain accurate
trajectories with a much larger time step than with conventional integration methods.
The n-body problem for planar motion has six invariants, all of which need to
be considered during the integration. Jacobi coordinates for this problem were used
to reduce the system to an (n − 1)-body problem in which the linear momentum and
center of mass constraints are implicitly built in, leaving fewer conservation laws to be
explicitly built into the algorithm. The kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian remains
in diagonal form (a sum of squares) in Jacobi coordinates; this makes it easy to express
the Hamiltonian as a linear function of new variables.

Future work in this area should include modifying the numerical code for the three-
dimensional case, regularizing the equations of motions to handle collisions and close
approaches, and building in precession, nutation, and tidal eﬀects into the equations of
motion.

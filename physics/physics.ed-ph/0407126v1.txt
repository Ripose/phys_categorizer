Abstract

In this rationalization for the orbital approximation, separable Hamiltonians are
constructed from exact Hamiltonians by expanding two-body operators in sums of
one-body terms. The exact force on an electron in Helium deviates from its separa-
ble counterpart by 12.12◦ in direction and 2.2% in magnitude for an arrangement of
electrons expected for the ground state of the separable Helium Hamiltonian.1

The review of common perspectives on the success of the orbital approximation in this
section includes a discussion of the expansion of two-body operators into separable and non-

based on this idea in section 2. Taylor expanding two-body operators provides students
a tangible experience of eﬀecting an approximation. Resulting solutions are qualitatively
useful. Hence this lesson might be appropriate for an introductory quantum physics course.

1.1 Phenomenological accounts

It had been known in the 1920s that atomic spectra resembled hydrogenic spectra [1]. Hartree
knew the functional form of the single-electron potential necessary to account for observed
spectra before the advent of wave mechanics. In 1927-1928, he numerically integrated single-
electron Schr¨odinger equations to obtain reasonable atomic energies.

Popular accounts coincide with Hartree’s work. Students intuit that each electron in an
atom is exposed to the smeared ﬁeld of the other electrons, and the intuition is justiﬁed
by agreement between orbital theory and observation. Audrey Companion writes, “there
are many experimental facts which indicate that in larger atoms something quite like the
quantum numbers n, l, and ml governs the behavior of the electrons. This in turn implies that
states like the s, p, d, f , . . . atomic orbitals exist and are occupied by these many electrons;
consequently, we extrapolate the one-electron orbital results to bigger atoms. Justiﬁcation for
doing this is that it works!” [2]. The validity of orbitals has been presented as a mathematical
accident. This issue has prompted complaints about assertions that chemistry has been
reduced to physics. Philosopher of chemistry Eric Scerri quotes C.K, Jorgensen, “Nature
plays a masquerade and behaves as if electron conﬁgurations most frequently are meaningful.
They are taxologically valid. We do not know why” 2[4][5].

1.2 Early physical perspectives

The seemingly accidental success of Hartree’s self-consistent-ﬁeld immediately prompted
Gaunt and Slater to demonstrate that a wavefunction built roughly from the mean-ﬁeld
approximation would lead to vanishing ﬁrst-order terms in calculations involving linear-
variation and perturbation theory [6].

We plot two instantaneous potentials provided by a 1s electron in ﬁgure 1. The solid
curve is obtained by placing the electron directly left of the nucleus; the dashed curve is
found by placing the electron directly to the right. The two potentials and their slopes are

for describing interactions between 1s and 2s electrons. In the vicinity of the 1s Bohr radius
= 1/3, however, the two potentials diﬀer signiﬁcantly in value and slope. A mean-

ﬁeld approximation seems less appropriate for describing interactions between 1s electrons.
Sinanoglu illustrated that mean ﬁelds resemble exact ﬁelds at long range by plotting the

two on the same set of axes [8].
In other words, correlation stems primarily from same-
shell electron interactions, not long-range intershell interactions. One expects the mean-
ﬁeld approximation to perform relatively poorly for systems exhibiting more short-range
interactions. Indeed, mean-ﬁeld calculations fair better for cations than for anions.

1.3 “Fermi-hole” explanations

Atomic functions are antisymmetric under electron label exchange, forbidding many elec-
tronic coalescence points. “Fermi hole” arguments have been put forth to explain the qual-
itative success of orbital wavefunctions for nuclei [9]. One is tempted to argue in similar
fashion regarding atomic systems, but these arguments must be taken with a grain of salt.
It is easy to provide simple explanations for trends in atomic energies when neglecting the
precise form of the “Fermi hole” in high-quality wavefunctions. The common Pauli-principle
rationalization of Hund’s rules was known to be incorrect in the 1960s [10].

1.4 Mathematical physics research

I mention two mathematical strategies for investigating mean-ﬁeld approximations. Volker
Bach has calculated asymptotic (large Z) error bounds for mean-ﬁeld theories [11][12]. Error
bounds endow approximations with rigorous predicitivity. One hopes for error bounds for
arbitrary Z.

Another method expands two-body operators as linear combinations of one-body opera-
tors. Mathematicians have called this technique “local linearization” [13]. Some textbooks
capitalize on this idea by calling the non-separable part of a potential ˆr12
a pertur-
bation in the atomic Hamiltonian [14][15][16][17][18]. Kregar [19][20][21], DiRocco [22][23],
and Fernandez [24] have authored literature that studies this separation in greater detail.

N. Bessis and G. Bessis concisely reproduced familiar screening-rule trends in the Journal
of Chemical Physics in 1981 [25]. I constructed the following lesson by combining a very
heuristic illustration of their techniques with a crude, obvious, high-school level comparison
of Taylor-expanded and exact Coulomb forces. My intent was to rationalize the orbital
approximation. In light of the lesson’s brevity I am surprised I have not yet found it published
in education journals.

Reference points are chosen in this paper by requiring expansion points and apices of
resulting many-body probability densities to coincide. As a crude example, consider only
the terms linear in 1/r1 and 1/r2 for three arrangements of electrons. For states in which

where the screening constant σ is determined for an electron in an orbital of principal quan-
tum number n according to the rules in table 1. Orbital occupations are chosen according to
the Pauli-exclusion principle to prevent the total orbital product in equation 11 from vanish-
ing under antisymmetrization. Refer to standard quantum mechanics texts [26,
12.1]. I call
§
the one-electron energies in equation 12 pseudo-energies. They depend on all the electrons
in the atom, and each electron’s pseudo-energy contains only part of the interelectronic po-
tential energy involving that electron. These crude rules provide an intuition with which to
approach papers on screening. Slater [7] wrote an early paper, and N. Bessis and G. Bessis’s
paper and Jung’s paper have references to more recent studies [25][27].

2.2 Anecdotal justiﬁcation of approximation

Figure 3 illustrates the typical arrangment of two electrons in the same shell in an orbital
wavefunction.
It is an introductory physics problem to quantify the total Coulomb force
provided by the exact Hamiltonian on an electron in this arrangement. The total force and
its radially directed component diﬀer by 12.12◦ in direction and 2.2% in magnitude. The
radial component is identical to the force provided through the Taylor expansion in equation

6. The separable part of the Hamiltonian is not such a crude approximation to the true
Hamiltonian.

Separable Hamiltonians introduce no energy splitting upon antisymmetrization, so ac-
tual splittings between states of diﬀerent spin multiplicities should be small. The un-
antisymmetrized wavefunctions and energies in equations 11 and 12 provide qualitative ref-
erence for experimental ionization potentials for the ﬁrst 18 elements as shown in ﬁgure 4.

Orthogonal orbitals can be obtained by solving a Hamiltonian whose one-body potentials
are identical. One might build a piecewise one-body potential by splicing together the
eﬀective one-body operators from various electron shells. One could also build a potential
by averaging over the charge distributions of the other electrons in an atom. The average
ﬁeld leads to a variational orbital product. This is an appropriate point for teachers to refer
students to Hartree-Fock theory [28].

3 Future work

This presentation addresses poorly the physics of d- and higher-shell elements. A rational-
ization of the Madelung rule is desired [29]. Aubert et al have studied shielding in diatomic
molecules [30][31][32][33][34]. Perhaps we can generalize our lesson to molecules by realizing
that we can Taylor expand two-electron operators regardless of the number of nuclei in a
system.

by about a quarter, and the n = 3 ionizations are all overestimated. Peaks found in the
experimental values at the ﬁlled 2s and 3s subshells and half-ﬁlled 2p and 3p subshells are
not found in calculated values.

A Taylor expansion

Series expansion of the interelectronic repulsion was also presented in the paper by N. Bessis
and G. Bessis [25]. In coincident spherical coordinates, the interelectronic repulsion is given
by equation 3. The angle between the position vectors of the two electrons is θ12. Imple-
menting a change of variables xi = 1/ri and y = cos(θ12) and expanding 1/r12 in a Taylor
series for small displacements from a best geometry (x1)0, (x2)0, and (y)0 gives

Let (y)0 = 0 as suggested in appendix B. Then omit the ﬁrst-order term linear in y to obtain
the expansions in this paper.

B Right-triangle assumption

θ

Consider the s-orbital in spherical coordinates r, θ, φ as a toy example. The expectation
= π/2, and its uncertainty is σθ = 0.22π. The probability
value of the polar angle θ is
density for θ is ρ(θ) = 1
2 sin(θ) (yes, this means absorbing the Jacobian into the density).
Think of the arbitrary +z-pole as containing the position of a second electron. Hence an s
electron is likely to form a bielectronic angle of π/2 with a second electron wherever that
second electron might be found. Koga has shown that the bielectronic angle is on average
some 92◦ in selected Hartree-Fock wavefunctions [35].

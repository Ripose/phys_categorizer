Abstract

When Alice went Through the Looking Glass [1], she found herself in a situation
where she had to run as fast as she could in order to stay still. In accordance with
the dictum that truth is stranger than ﬁction, we will see that it is possible to ﬁnd
a situation in special relativity where running towards one’s target is actually
counter-productive. Although the situation is easily analysed algebraically, the
qualitative properties of the analysis are greatly illuminated by the use of space-
time diagrams.

Although tachyons (particles which travel faster than light) are not at present ob-
served experimentally, they arise naturally in superstring theory, where their conse-
quences require investigation: one example of such an inquiry is found in [2]. Outside
this context, tachyons have also been considered from advanced viewpoints, as in [3],
in which it was found that the obvious problems associated with causality might be
illusory; and from elementary viewpoints, as in [4] where simple geometrical prop-
erties of a tachyonic wavefront were considered.

This article takes a brief look at how tachyons appear to move from the point of
view of various inertial observers in special relativity. The results are reminiscent of
Alice’s experience through the looking glass, where she had to run as fast as she could
just to stay still. Here we will ﬁnd that the situation can be worse even than that: it is
possible for a target to recede faster, the faster you chase it.

Although the results are easy to obtain algebraically, it is the use of space-time
diagrams that renders the situation intelligible. Finally, the relative strengths of the
algebraic and diagrammatic approaches are brieﬂy discussed. The article is presented
in a discursive manner, and should be accessible to students who have taken a course
in special relativity.

We will restrict our attention to situations in which all motion takes place along the
x-axis in Minkowski space, so that we can consider kinematics in a two-dimensional
space-time; furthermore, we will suppose that units have been chosen so that c = 1.
So, consider an inertial frame Σ, with associated coordinates (t, x). In this space-time
we have three observers, A, B and C. A is at rest at x = 0, B is heading in the positive
x-direction with speed 1/2 and C is travelling in the negative x-direction at speed
1/2; they all meet at x = 0 when t = 0.

Now consider the following announcements, made just after the three observers

pass each other:
A I just saw something travelling in the positive x-direction at speed uA = 3/2
B I just saw something travelling in the positive x-direction at speed uB = 4
C I just saw something travelling in the positive x-direction at speed uC = 8/7

The surprising thing is that these three comments should all apply to observations
of the same object. The reason it is surprising is that since B is travelling in the posi-
tive x-direction, and C in the negative x-direction, we would normally expect that B
should see an obect travelling in the positive x-direction travel slower than A, while
C would see it travel faster. But, contrariwise, the observations have uC < uB < uA.
In order to resolve this apparent paradox, let us consider how velocities transform
between frames of reference in special relativity. We will see that this is, in fact, in-
dependent of the velocity to be transformed, and so the usual relativistic ‘addition of
velocities’ is valid even when we are working with a tachyonic particle.

For simplicity, we consider only one dimension of space. So let Σ, with coordinates
(t, x), be some nominal rest frame, and let Σ′ be a frame whose origin is travelling
with speed V in the positive x-direction in Σ, with coordinates (t′, x′). Suppose also
that the event with t = 0, x = 0 also has t′ = 0, x′ = 0. Then the coordinates (t, x) and
(t′, x′) are related by the usual Lorentz transformation

t = γ(t′ + Vx′)
x = γ(x′ + Vt′)

(1)

where γ = 1/√1

V2.

Now, suppose we have an object whose world-line is given in terms of (t, x) by
x = ut, so that it is travelling with speed u in the positive x-direction. Expressing x
and t in terms of x′ and t′ we immediately obtain

which is easily rearranged to give

x′ + Vt′ = u(t′ + Vx′)

Denoting by u′ the speed in the positive x′-direction, as measured in Σ′, we have

Thus we have the usual ‘addition of velocities’ rule, and observe that this result is
quite independent of the sign or size of u.

So we can now easily check that if A sees an object moving to the right at speed

3/2, then B (for whom V = 1/2) will attribute to it a speed of

while C (with V =

1/2) will ﬁnd its speed to be

−

We can see, then, from the algebraic properties of the Lorentz transformations,
that this is indeed how the velocity of a tachyonic particle would transform between
frames of reference. In fact, the speed of the tachyon as measured by a moving ob-
server has still more peculiar properties.

First, let us look at the tachyon’s velocity in a frame moving with velocity V; if we

call this velocity u′, then we saw above that

Differentiating this with respect to V, we obtain

which is always positive; hence, the faster you chase a tachyon, the faster it recedes.
However, even this is not as straighforward as it looks at ﬁrst glance. Examining

the form of u′ more carefully, we make the following observations:

1. As V

1, u′ →

2. For V between

3. As V

4. u′ is increasing as V increases from 1/u to 1, and as V

1, u′ →

1.

→

So we see that the tachyon is seen to travel faster than light by all inertial ob-
servers; but that as the speed of the moving observer increases, the speed with which
the tachyon recedes increases without bound until suddenly it switches from reced-
ing with extremely high speed to approaching with extremely high speed, but then
the speed of approach decreases as the speed of the moving observer continues to
increase.

Again, although it is simple to derive all this by applying simple algebra to the

velocity transformation rule, it is unclear what is really going on here.

In order to obtain some insight into the situation, we consider some space-time
diagrams [5]. (It is worth noting that this form of space-time diagram is not the only
one; Shadowitz [6] considers a variety of space-time diagrams, each of which has its
strengths. However, we will make use of only the form due to Minkowski, and leave
investigation of the others to the reader.)

First, consider a space-time diagram that shows only the rest-frame of A, namely
Σ, and the tachyon worldline in it. As is customary, the units of distance and time are
chosen such that light rays are at 45◦ to the vertical.

So we clearly see that the tachyon is proceeding in the direction of increasing x faster
than a light ray in frame Σ.

We can now introduce to the diagram the t′ and x′ axes of the rest frame of an
observer moving at constant velocity. First, we note that the relation given in equation
1 can be rearranged to give

so that the x′-axis is given by t′ = 0, i.e. t = Vx, and the t′-axis by x′ = 0, i.e. t = x/V.

By inspecting this diagram we see that the situation is not so counter-intuitive af-
ter all. In the same way as a Lorentz transformation to a frame with positive speed
in the x-direction will make the worldline of a particle travelling in that direction
with a lesser speed ‘more timelike’ in the sense that it becomes nearer the t-axis, such
a Lorentz transformation will make the worldline of a tachyon ‘more spacelike’; so
that an observer who is travelling in the same direction as a tachyon attributes to it
a greater speed than the stationary observer. Furthermore, as the speed increases,
it reaches a value at which the tachyon worldline is a line of simultaneity (the per-
ceived speed taking on unboundedly large values); and for larger speeds, the tachyon
worldline has speed with unboundedly large value to the left, which then reduce in
magnitude as the speed of the observer continues to grow.

The diagrammatic investigation also brings out the symmetry between this situ-
ation and that of the different velocities ascribed by observers to an object moving
with constant sub-luminal speed; for just as by chasing sufﬁciently fast an observer
can make this object’s worldline will pass through the his line of constant position, so
he can make the tachyon’s worldline pass through his line of constant time.

From this investigation, then, we can see the respective strengths of the algebraic
and diagrammatic approaches to analysing this situation. The algebraic approach
provides complete quantitative information, but does little to give any insight into
the qualitative behaviour of the transformed velocities. On the other hand, space-
time diagrams make the qualititative behaviour comprehensible, without giving easy
access to the numerical values of observed speed.

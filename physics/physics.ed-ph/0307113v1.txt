Abstract. After a systematic introduction of some formulae for the energy radiated
by localized electric charges and currents distributions, one considers the multipole
radiation and the reduction of the multipole tensors to the symmetric traceless ones.

1. Introduction

In the calculation of the energy radiated at large distances by a localised electric charged
system it is not necessary to know the exact expressions of the electromagnetic ﬁelds E
and B or of the potentials A and Φ. One may avoid the exact calculation, sometimes
relatively complicate, in a simple way based on a formula for the power radiated by a
charged system described by the charge ρ and current j densities with supports included
in a ﬁnite domain D [1]:

Here the origin O of the coordinates is chosen in the domain D, ν = r/r, dP/dΩ is
related to the ﬂow of the energy detected in the observation point r at large distance r
compared with the dimensions of the given charged system. The vector Arad is obtained

with R = r − r′, by retaining only the dominant terms at large distances. A ﬁrst

In these relations and in the following ones we denote by O(xn) a series of powers of x
beginning with xn.

Supposing r >> λ, where λ is an arbitrary wave length from the radiation spectrum,
such that the observation point is in the wave region, and retaining in equation (1) only
the terms having nonzero limits for r → ∞, one obtains an approximate expression
related to the energy ﬂow observed in the point r and moment t. Rigorously, this is
that part of the energy ﬂowing in the neighbourhood of the observation point which
contributes to the radiated energy. In the following we assume to work in this wave
region.

2. The radiation ﬁeld

In [1] the equation (1) is justiﬁed using the supposed plane wave behaviour of the
radiated ﬁeld but also in [1], in a footnote of the page 229, a rigorous proof is suggested
for this. Indeed, this may be done by considering consistently only the terms from E
and B contributing to the radiation [2].

Denoting by t′ = t − R/c the retarded time, and by

[ρ] = ρ(r′, t′),

[j] = j(r′, t′)

the retarded charge and current densities, we have

B(r, t) = ∇ × A(r, t) =

Let the sphere of the radius r with the center in O. The radiated energy δ∆Wrad passing
through the surface element ∆σ, centered on the point r and corresponding to the solid
angle ∆Ω, in the time interval (t, t + δt) is deﬁned by
δ∆Wrad = ν · Srad r2∆Ωδt.

(7)

From the last equation one sees that the angular distribution of the radiation power is
given by the equation (1).

3. The radiation of the point electric charge

Usually, one derives the angular distribution of the power radiated by a point electric
charge q using the results for the ﬁelds E and B obtained from the Li´enard-Wiechert
potentials and retaining from the corresponding expressions only the terms contributing
to the radiation [1]-[3]. Here we illustrate the simplicity of the calculation using in this
case the formula (1).

For the sake of completeness we remind a concise introduction of the Li´enard-
Wiechert potentials [4]. Considering that the motion of the point charge q is given by
the law t −→ ξ(t), the charge and current densities are represented as

ρ(r, t) = qδ[r − ξ(t)], j(r, t) = qv(t)δ[r − ξ(t)]

where δ is the Dirac function. The retarded vector potential A is represented by the
integral

where R(t) = r − ξ(t) gives the position of the observation point with respect to the

where β = v/c and n(t) = R(t)/R(t). Because v < c we have f ′(t′) > 0 so that the
equation f (t′) = 0 has only one root τ :

Denoting η(t) = 1 − β(t) · n(t), s(t) = η(t)R(t), the vector potential A is given by the

We have to calculate the expression ν ×∂
Arad/∂t in order to introduce it in the equation
(1). The observation point being given by its position vector r, it is clear that in the
approximation considered here the same result is obtained for any chosen origin O inside
the domain D. The unit vector ν may be replaced by the unit vector n of the direction
particle-observation point without changing the result for the angular distribution of
the radiated power. This happens because

where all the particle parameters are considered at the retarded moment. Inserting the
equation (15) in the equation (7), and casting the terms of O(1/r), we obtain that part
of the energy passing through the surface element ∆σ, in the time interval δt, which
contributes to the radiation. This is just the radiated part of the energy ﬂowing in
the solid angle ∆Ω between the moments τ and t. But this energy was emitted by the
particle in the time interval δτ corresponding to the observation interval δt. Therefore,
writing

δ∆Wrad = Srad · nr2∆Ω

∂t
∂τ

δτ,

the factor multiplying δτ in the right hand side of the last equation represents in fact the
radiated part of the energy emitted by the particle in the unit of time (at an arbitrary
time) in the direction n and in the solid angle ∆Ω. Because ∂t/∂τ = η(τ ) we may
write the ﬁnal result for the angular distribution of the radiation power emitted by the
particle as an expression diﬀering from the right hand side of the equation (16) by the
factor 1/η5 instead of 1/η6 [1].

4. Multipolar expansion of Arad

The series expansion of the integrand from the equation (2), by retaining only the
1/r terms contributing to the radiation, leads ﬁnally to the multipole expansion of the
radiation ﬁeld.

In [6, 7] was done a general procedure for the reduction of multipole tensors represented
by Cartesian components to symmetric traceless ones in the static and dynamic cases.
The transformations implied by this reduction are deﬁned such that the electromagnetic
potentials A and Φ are modiﬁed only by gauge transformations implying a speciﬁc
feature of the dynanmic case: the redeﬁnitions of the multipole tensors in the lower
k < n orders induced by the reduction of tensors in a given order n. In the present
paper this procedure is applied to the radiation ﬁeld and, obviously, only the vector
potential is to be considered.

The reduction of multipole tensors begining with a given order n is achieved by the

following steps.

1. The reduction of the magnetic nth-order tensor M(n), given by the equation
(23), to a symmetric tensor M(sym). Since the magnetic tensor M(n) is symmetric only

which preserves the symmetry proprties of P(n−2).

By this last transformation (45), the reduction of the multipolar tensors in the
given nth-order is achieved. Now, to carry out this procedure to the n − 1th order, we
must realize that in this order some tensors was been already modiﬁed in order to set
oﬀ the alterations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld by the reductions in the nth-order. So,
the transformation (33) alters the symmetry properties of the (n − 1)th order electric
multipole tensor because

By this transformation the symmetry properties of M′(n−2) are preserved. Particularly,
by reducing the (n − 2)th-order multipolar tensors, in the case of M′′(n−2) we have to
achieve only the symmetrisation of the supplementary term from the equation (40).

6. Concluding remarks

The equation (1) is a basic formula in the investigation of the radiation of electric
charges distributions. In a course on Electrodynamics the radiation chapter is one of
the mains goals of the introduction of Maxwell’s equations. Sometimes it is necessary
to give quickly some results illustrating the properties of the electromagnetic radiation.
For the economy of this course it is a beneﬁt to avoid some unnecessary intermediate
results such as the expressions of the ﬁelds E and B. By exposing this problem in
the sections 2 and 3, the present paper is not claimed as an original one but would be
warranted at least by concerns of methodological completeness.

If we begin the reduction from a given order n, then the results of the reductions of P(n)
and P(k) are the tensors P (n) and M(n) given by the equations (59) and (56) but for
k < n the kth-order reduced multipole tensors may diﬀer from P (k) and M(k) by terms
iduced by the procedure of the reductions from the previous steps. These last terms
give contributions to the potentials and ﬁelds expressed by toroidal moments and mean
radii of various orders.

We give here some simple examples of such reductions and we will see how naturally

the toroidal moments appear as a result of such an approach.

Let us the reduction of the magnetic and electric multipole tensors begins from the
µth and εth orders respectively (generally, considering the multipole’s contributions of
the same orders, µ = ε − 1).

These results show that one may obtain from the formula (26) the correct
representation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld by the reduced multipolar tensors but
introducing these tensors up to a given order n, we obtain separate contributions from
some electric toroidal moments and mean 2n−power radii. This was pointed out ﬁrstly
by Dubovik et al [ 10-12].
In the present paper we point out that considering the
contributions to the electromagnetic ﬁeld of some toroidal moments, one suppose the
reduction of the multipole tensors up to a well deﬁned maximal order n.
We illustrate also this statement by calculating the total power radiated by a system of
electric charges and currents.

but all the terms from the sum of δ−products representing the averaged products of

εinpq and of the traceless character of A and B, the result is zero. Using these results in

For µ < 5 and ε < 6, the quantities N, Λ, ... are obtained from the above expressions by
eliminating the contributions of the magnetic multipolar tensors of orders nm > µ and
of the the electric ones for orders ne > ε.

We point out that the reduction diagrams described in this appendix are valid also

in the case of an arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁeld as may be seen from [7].

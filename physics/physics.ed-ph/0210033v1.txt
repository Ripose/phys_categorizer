Abstract
In this paper we review the theory of the “falling chimney”, which deals with the breaking in
mid-air of tall structures, when they fall to the ground. We show that these ruptures can be caused
by either shear forces, typically developing near the base, or by the bending of the structure, which
is caused primarily by the internal bending moment.

In the latter case the breaking is more likely to occur between one third and one half of the height
of the chimney. Small scale toy models are used to reproduce the dynamics of the falling chimney.
By examining photos taken during the fall of these models we test the adequacy of the outlined
theory. This type of experiment, easy to perform and conceptually challenging, can become part
of a rotational mechanics lab for undergraduate students.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most interesting demonstrations for an introductory mechanics course is the
“Falling Chimney - Free Fall Paradox,” as it was named by Sutton in his classical book
Demonstration Experiments in Physics.1 In the original version of this demo a ball is placed
at one end of a uniform stick, which is pivoted at the other end and makes initially an angle
of about 30◦ with the horizontal. The elevated end of the stick is suddenly dropped, together
with the ball, thus showing a very counter-intuitive behavior. The falling end of the stick
accelerates at a greater rate than the free-falling ball, proving that its acceleration is greater
than g, the acceleration of gravity.

A simpliﬁed version of the experiment can be performed just with a meter stick and a
coin. The stick is supported in the horizontal position by two ﬁngers, placed near the two
ends. A coin is set on the stick near one end, which is suddenly released. The eﬀect is similar
to the previous demonstration: the falling end of the rotating stick eventually acquires an
acceleration greater than that of the freely falling coin, which loses contact with the stick
surface and lags behind the falling stick.

A description of the ﬁrst version of the experiment can be found in almost every book of
physics demonstrations,2,3,4 sometimes with diﬀerent names (“Falling Stick”, “Hinged Stick
and Falling Ball”, and others). Photographic descriptions or even video-clips of this demo
can be found on-line in several web-pages (see our web-page,5 for a collection of related
links).

In addition, countless papers exist in the literature; we have traced several of these, from
the 1930’s to our times. Some of the earliest discussions can be found in Constantinides6
and Ludeke7 (as well in the book by Sutton1), followed by many others.8,9,10,11,12 These
concentrate mostly on the simple explanation of the eﬀect, which relies on the concept of
“center of percussion” of the rotating stick (a simple introduction to this concept can be
found in Bloomﬁeld13).

This particular point of the stick (located at a distance from the hinged end equal to two
thirds of the length, for a uniform stick) is moving with the same acceleration as a particle
under gravity, constrained to move along the same circular path. Points on the stick beyond
the center of percussion descend with accelerations greater than that of particles freely
moving under gravity, on their respective circular paths. As a consequence of this, if the
initial angle formed by the stick with the horizontal is less than about 35◦, the end point
will possess at all times a vertical component of the acceleration greater than g, producing
the eﬀect described above (see Sect. II for a more detailed explanation).

Several variations of the basic demonstration also exist,14,15,16,17,18,19 the majority of which
suggest attaching an additional mass to the rotating stick at diﬀerent positions. The eﬀect
for the student or the viewer is even less intuitive than the original version: an additional
mass placed near the end of the stick actually reduces the acceleration of the end point,
aﬀecting substantially the outcome of the experiment (a complete discussion of this eﬀect
can be found in Bartlett17). The center of percussion of the stick still plays a key role: if
the additional mass is placed beyond it, the acceleration of the rotational motion will be
reduced; if it is placed before, the rotational motion will be enhanced. The eﬀect is null if
the mass is placed exactly at the center of percussion.

The next logical step is to analyze the behavior of a real falling chimney. Almost in-
variably a tall chimney, falling to the ground like the stick in the previous discussion, will
break in mid-air at some characteristic height. This is well documented in several photos

2

reproduced in the literature, such as the one which appeared on the cover of the September
1976 issue of The Physics Teacher (other photos can be found in Bundy20 and Bartlett,21
or also on our web-page5). The causes of such breaking, the height of the rupture point
and the angle at which the breaking is most likely to occur, are the most natural questions
arising.

The ﬁrst analysis22 of this problem compared the fall of the real chimney to the fall
of the hinged stick, but wrongly identiﬁed the center of percussion (at about two thirds
of the height) as the probable point of rupture. Reynolds23 ﬁrst identiﬁed the possible
causes of the breaking with the shear forces and the bending moment originating within
the structure of the toppling chimney. More detailed analyses were given by Bundy20 and
Madsen24 (the most complete papers we found on the subject) while simpliﬁed explanations
are also reported.21,25,26 This problem even appears in graduate students study guides,27,28
even though in one of these books the chimney is shown bending the wrong way.

In this paper we review the theory of the real falling chimney, outlined by Madsen,24
aiming for a complete and clear explanation of this phenomenon in Sects. II and III. Then,
in Sect. IV, we propose simple ways of using small scale models (literally toy models - made
with toy blocks and bricks) to test eﬀectively the outlined theory. More information on these
toy models can also be found on our web-site,5 together with photos and movie clips of the
experiments we have performed.

II. ROTATIONAL MOTION OF THE FALLING CHIMNEY

er and

The rotational motion of a falling chimney under gravity is equivalent to that of the falling
hinged stick of Sect. I. We can describe it as in Fig. 1, where we use polar coordinates r and
eθ as unit vectors) for the position of an arbitrary point A on the longitudinal
θ (with
axis of the chimney, measuring the angle θ from the vertical direction. We treat the chimney
as a uniform rigid body of mass m and height H, under the action of its weight W = mg,
applied to the center of gravity (basically the center of mass -CM- of the body), and a force
F exerted by the ground on the base of the chimney, assumed to act at a single point (we
neglect air resistance, or any other applied force). In plane polar coordinates:

INTERNAL FORCES AND BENDING MOMENT

We now move to the analysis of the internal forces which develop inside the structure
of the falling chimney. The resulting stresses and bending moment are the causes of the
rupture of the toppling chimney. Consider, as in Fig. 2, an arbitrary lower portion of the
chimney of height r (as opposed to the total height H) and the forces acting on this part of
the structure due to the upper portion and the base. The weight of the lower portion is now
W (r) = mg r
H (assuming again a uniform structure, so that the weight is proportional to
the height of the considered portion) and it is applied to the center of gravity of this lower

The force F, applied at the base, is still the same as in Eqs. 8a, 8b, but we have to add
the action of the upper part on the lower portion. This can be described by a transverse
shearing force S = Sθ

positive in the
of a “bending moment” Nb, again acting at the cross section and represented in the picture
by the curved arrow. Since we treat this as a plane problem, the bending moment can only
have a component perpendicular to the plane of the ﬁgure, i.e., in the z direction. No other
components are considered here, in particular we assume that no torsional moment exist in
the structure, which would tend to twist the chimney around its longitudinal axis.

This analysis of the internal forces and moments follows the general discussion of stresses
and moments in a beam or any similar structure, which can be found in every textbook
on Statics (see for example29) and which can be easily adapted to our case. The bending
moment Nb = Nb
ez can be thought as originating from a couple of forces, f and −f, that
can be regarded as applied to the leading and trailing edge of the structure, at the cross
section considered. This couple of forces is shown explicitly in the papers by Bundy20 and
Madsen24, but we prefer to use directly the concept of bending moment in our treatment.
Nb will be assumed to be positive if it acts as in the ﬁgure, i.e., a positive component of the
torque in the z direction (we assume here the use of a right-handed system of coordinate

compressions.

From Fig. 3 we see that Pr is negative (a compression) for smaller angles, but eventually
becomes positive (a tension) for angles greater than about 45◦. Pr also depends critically
on r
H (for θ = 0◦, Pr represents simply the compression due to the weight of the upper part
acting on the lower part). This longitudinal force will be combined later with the bending
moment to determine the total stress at the leading and trailing edges, which is the most
typical cause of the rupture.

In Fig. 4 we plot the (transverse) shear force Sθ, which can be the other leading cause
of rupture. It is easily seen that, for any considered angle, the magnitude of the shear force
|Sθ| has an absolute maximum at r
H = 0 (and a positive value), meaning that large shear
eθ direction, usually originate near the base. The shear force is always zero
forces, in the
at one third of the height, and |Sθ| also has a (relative) maximum at 2
3H (with a negative
b
eθ direction), but this value is smaller than the one near the
value, therefore Sθ is in the −
base.

From this analysis, it is typically concluded that if the structure breaks from shear stress
alone, this is usually more likely to happen near the base. This can be seen for example in
the already mentioned cover photo of the September 1976 issue of The Physics Teacher,5,21
showing the fall of a chimney in Detroit. The two ruptures at the bottom are likely due
to shear forces, while a third rupture can be seen at about r = 0.47H, and this is due to
the combination of bending moment and longitudinal force Pr, as we will explain in the
following. More photos and detailed pictorial descriptions of chimney ruptures can be found
in the paper by Bundy.5,20

which is plotted in Fig. 5, as a function of the height fraction and for various angles.37
Nb is always negative, showing that it is actually directed in the opposite way of Fig. 2.
This particular direction of the bending moment will induce a tension in the leading edge
of the chimney and a compression in the trailing edge. The structure will bend accordingly,
with the concavity on the side of the trailing edge, and will eventually break in the way
shown by the many existing photos. We can see that, for any angle, the bending moment is
obviously zero at the bottom and at the top of the chimney, while it assumes its maximum
absolute value at exactly one third of the height H. The bending moment alone would
therefore induce a rupture at one third of the structure, but the total longitudinal stress
at the leading edge is also due to the force Pr, as we will show next. Another interesting
relation between the bending moment Nb and the shear force Sθ is that they are in general
related by a simple derivative, i.e., Sθ = − ∂Nb
∂r , as it is easy to check from Eq. 12b and Eq.
13.38

Finally, we can combine Nb and Pr to compute the total longitudinal stress on the cross
sectional area between the lower and upper parts. We follow the theory of elasticity and
deformations in beams, which can be found in classical treatises such as Sommerfeld30 and
Landau-Lifshitz,31 or again in Bundy’s paper.20 The longitudinal stress is maximum at
the leading and trailing edges, located at the maximum distance from the longitudinal

surface which is neither stretched nor compressed.

For simplicity, we will only consider from here on, structures with uniform square cross
section of side a, as this is the case of the toy models described in Sect. IV. In this case the
stresses at the leading and trailing edge, σL and σT respectively, can be evaluated from

a2 , in order to obtain a dimensionless quantity which

This quantity depends also on the ratio H

a , which for a real chimney is of the order
H
a & 10. For the toy models described in Sect. IV, the value of this ratio is even bigger:
H
a ≃ 24 − 61, enhancing the contribution of the second term of Eq. 15, which comes from
the bending moment Nb. In Fig. 6 we show the plot for H
a = 24, but similar ﬁgures can be
obtained for diﬀerent values of the ratio.

In Eqs. 14-15, and in Fig. 6 the total stresses are considered positive if they represent
tensions, negative if they are compressions. It is easily seen from the ﬁgure that the stress at
the leading edge σL, is initially a compression, but eventually becomes a tension, constantly
increasing for larger angles; σT on the contrary is usually a compression. It is therefore the
combination of these intense tensile stresses in the leading part of the chimney (and also
compressions on the trailing side) that causes the rupture of the chimney.

This type of breaking is more likely to occur at the positive maximum value of σL. This
maximum value depends critically on the r
H ratio, for a certain angle of rupture θ, so it
is possible, just by looking at the maxima of the solid curves in Fig. 6 (marked by solid
points), to roughly match the height of the rupture point to the angle at which the breaking
started to occur. As far as the actual prediction of the point of rupture, this would obviously
depend on the building materials and the construction of the chimney or tower, an analysis
of which goes beyond the scope of this work.

It is interesting to note, from Fig. 6 again, that the stress σL is not always maximum at
one third of the height (as for the bending moment of Fig. 5). For small angles of about
θ ≃ 5◦ − 20◦ it reaches a maximum for r
H ≃ 0.4 − 0.5, while for larger angles it approaches
H ≃ 1
the typical ratio r
3. This means that if the chimney breaks early in its fall, for small
angles, it is more likely to break near the center; on the contrary if the rupture occurs at
larger angles, the breaking point is usually shifted toward one third of the height. This is
the eﬀect of the Pr term in Eq. 14, which modiﬁes the position of the maximum σL (or σT ).
This dependence can be noted in several of the existing photos of falling chimneys, when
the breaking occurs due to the bending of the structure and not for the transverse shear
stress near the base mentioned at the beginning of this section. The angle of rupture can

be roughly estimated by measuring the angle the upper part of the chimney forms with the
vertical in the photos. This angle tends in fact not to change much after the rupture, since
the upper part falls without much additional rotation. For example the photos in the paper
by Bartlett5,21 refer to chimneys breaking at about θ ≃ 20◦−25◦ and for r
H ≃ 0.47, consistent
with the previous discussion.39 Similar behavior can be seen in other photos,5,20 since real
chimneys tend to break very early in their fall, due to the intense stresses originating within
their structure.

IV. TOY MODELS

In this section we discuss our eﬀorts to reproduce the eﬀects described above, with the
help of toy models of the falling chimney. These models were constructed with simple toy
blocks of diﬀerent type and size, and their fall was ﬁlmed with a digital camera, so that we
could analyze the events frame by frame, to test the theory. Complete details on the type of
blocks used, experimental settings and video-capture techniques, as well as the complete set
of our video-recordings and still photos can be found on our web-site,5 and in an upcoming
publication.32

Bundy noted in his work20 that the use of a model to test a real chimney would be
useless due to a “scale eﬀect.” The stresses inside the chimney depend roughly on the scale
of the object, so that real chimneys would develop bigger stresses than equivalent small-
scale models, therefore breaking earlier in their fall. Nevertheless we found it interesting to
reproduce these eﬀects in small scale models to test especially the discussion based on Fig.
6. It was also supposed to be diﬃcult20 to show these eﬀects with toy models.40

Fig. 7 is the ﬁrst example of one of our toy models. We made a tower by simply stacking
24 wooden toy blocks of cubic shape, for a total height H = 0.76 m, mass m = 0.32 kg
and a ratio H
a = 24, the value used in Fig. 6. The tower was set into the falling motion
by removing a support at the bottom, inducing a rotation without slipping at the bottom
point. The picture clearly shows the “rupture” due to bending of the structure at exactly
half the height, r
H = 0.50, and for a small angle θ . 10◦, which again can be estimated by
measuring the angle the upper part of the chimney forms with the vertical direction. This
is in good agreement with the position of the maximum for the solid-10◦ curve in Fig. 6.

Our second example is a taller tower (H = 1.9 m, m = 0.65 kg, and H

a = 61) made with
100 plastic blocks of a very popular brand of toy bricks. The blocks are inserted on top
of each other so that bending of the structure is allowed, but shear stress cannot possibly
break the tower. The 100 toy blocks are arranged by color to subdivide the structure into
three equal parts, and also the position of the center is marked. This time the rupture
occurs for an angle around θ ≃ 30◦ − 35◦, and at the height ratio r
H = 0.40. Again this is
consistent with the 30◦ solid curve in Fig. 6, showing that the theory is applicable also to
these small-scale models.

We performed several other experiments, varying the dimensions of the towers, the type
of blocks, always obtaining results consistent with the theory. We can conclude that it is
actually easy to reproduce the bending and breaking of chimneys with small scale towers,
and this type of experiment could be made part of an undergraduate laboratory class for
rotational mechanics, with some minor adaptations and changes.32

FIG. 7: The ﬁrst toy model made with wooden blocks. The structure appears to break at r
H = 0.5,
and at a small angle θ . 10◦, which can be estimated by measuring the angle formed by the upper
part of the tower with the vertical.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we reviewed the theory of the falling chimney, showing that the rupture can
be caused by either shear forces typically near the base, or by the bending of the structure
which is caused primarily by the bending moment, but is also aﬀected by the longitudinal
stress force. In the latter case the breaking is more likely to occur between one third and
one half of the height of the chimney.

This point of rupture is also related to the angle of rupture and this relationship can be
veriﬁed in the many existing photographic reports of falling chimneys. We also constructed
several small scale toy models, showing that it is possible with them to reproduce the
dynamics of the fall. By examining photos taken during the fall of these models we also
tested the adequacy of the outlined theory.

35 We don’t need to include here the centripetal acceleration ar, since we are just considering the

“starting point” of the motion, where ar = 0.

36 The bending moment and the stress forces can be thought as applied to the center (centroid)
of the cross sectional area we are considering, on the face belonging to the lower portion of the
structure. Equal and opposite forces and moments would originate on the face belonging to
the upper portion.

37 Here we normalize Nb, dividing by the weight mg and the total height H of the chimney.
38 The relations between bending moment and shear forces are described in almost every

textbook on Statics, typically within the discussion of loads and stresses in beams. A positive
sign in the relation between bending moment and shear is usually reported, due to a diﬀerent
choice of the sign of the moment.

39 In the case of a real chimney a smaller ratio H

a ≃ 10 should be used in Eq. 15. The maximum

for the 20◦ solid curve of Fig. 6 would simply shift to r

H ≃ 0.45.

40 We did not ﬁnd any use of toy models for this problem, either in the literature or in web-pages

devoted to physics demos. We will be grateful to receive information about similar
experiments, if any.

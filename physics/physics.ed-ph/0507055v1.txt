Abstract. A didactic description of the thermodynamic properties of classical
spin systems is given in terms of their quantum counterpart in the Hamiltonian
limit. Emphasis is on the construction of the relevant Hamiltonian, and the
calculation of thermal averages is explicitly done in the case of small systems
described, in Hamiltonian ﬁeld theory, by small matrices.

1. Introduction

A rather interesting method for studying thermal ﬂuctuations of (d + 1)-dimensional
interacting classical degrees of freedom is provided through the corresponding analysis
of quantum ﬂuctuations in a d-dimensional system of interacting quantum degrees of
freedom. The correspondence is detailed in the remarkable review of Kogut [1]. It can
be understood as a re-wording of the transfer matrix formalism [2] of classical systems
in a special limit where the transfer matrix takes a simpliﬁed form, the so-called
Hamiltonian limit [3]. At the origin of the correspondence, there is the transition
amplitude between quantum states in the path integral formulation,

Amplitude =

where the classical action is a functional of x(t), the time integral of a Lagrangian

where ˆT is the inﬁnitesimal time evolution operator which, in the Euclidean time,
becomes the transfer matrix ˆT = exp(

A challenging problem in critical phenomena is the identiﬁcation of the
universality class of a given model. Due to scaling relations among critical exponents,
the knowledge of two of them determines the whole set of exponents (see table 1).
From ﬁnite size-scaling (FSS) behaviour of the critical densities [4], we expect power
law behaviours of local quantities in terms of the ﬁnite size L in the space direction,

These relations may be taken as deﬁnitions of the scaling dimensions of the energy

notation for the critical exponents is reminded in table 1. Imagine that we consider a
1-space dimensions. The classical counterpart
more general quantum problem in d
is deﬁned in d-dimensions (space and time) and the susceptibility for example follows

should scale like L−xφ (see e.g. equations (17) and (18)),
The matrix element
L−1 in order to
hence relation (20) requires that the gap scales according to gapφ ∼
Lγ/ν with γ/ν = 2
restore the usual scaling of the susceptibility χ
2xφ (see
η = d
−
table 1). Note that the gap being an inverse correlation length, its scaling inversely
proportional to the typical linear size of the system logically means that the correlation
length at criticality is locked at that size.

∼

The scaling of the gap is more constrained in 2d where rather powerful
techniques apply. Conformal invariance indeed provides quite eﬃcient methods for
the determination of critical exponents of two-dimensional critical systems [5]. The
cylinder geometry is relevant in the study of quantum chains, since such a chain with
periodic boundary conditions in the space direction just corresponds to an inﬁnitely
long classical cylinder (1 + 1 dimensions) of complex coordinates w = time + i
space
(here, Euclidean time is assumed). This former geometry follows from the inﬁnite two-
dimensional plane z = reiθ through the standard logarithmic mapping w(z) = L
2π ln z
and, at the critical point, the correlation functions transform according to conformal
covariance, leading along the cylinder to [6]

From comparison with equation (19), the critical correlation length amplitude appears
universal and its value related to the corresponding critical exponent through the
simple relation

The matrix elements are also predicted by conformal invariance and follow from
equation (21),

A prescription before using any conformal invariance result concerns the scaling
of the whole spectrum. Multiplying the Hamiltonian by an arbitrary number of course
changes the scale of the spectrum. Gap scaling from equation (22) requires to ﬁx the
normalization in such a way that the sound velocity is unity [7]. The sound velocity
might be deﬁned in the long-wavelength limit, sound velocity = ∆E/∆k, where ∆E
is for instance measured by gaps in the bottom of the spectrum and ∆k = 2π/L is
given by the quantization step of wave vectors.

3. Quantum Ising chain

The two-dimensional Ising model is often used as the paradigmatic illustration of
second-order phase transitions. It is one of the most simple non trivial models and in
the following we will show how its quantum counterpart, the quantum Ising chain in
a transverse ﬁeld, is built.

Let us ﬁrst consider a ladder of classical Ising spins si,j =

j = 1, 2 (see ﬁgure 2). The nearest neighbour interactions are denoted as Ks = βJs

The transfer matrix eventually follows

The multiple spin ﬂip terms appear in the expansion of the exponential through
product of terms like in equation (34). The generalization to a lattice of width L
in the space direction (we choose now for the rest of the paper periodic boundary
conditions ˆσx,z(L + 1) = ˆσx,z(1) in space direction) is straightforward, summing over
j = 1, L,

The transfer matrix has a complicated structure, since arbitrary large numbers of
single spin transitions may simultaneously occur and the matrix representation of ˆT
is expected to be dense. It may be considerably simpliﬁed in the extreme anisotropic
limit also called Hamiltonian limit, since then only single spin transitions survive and
ˆH is a sparser matrix. Remember that the relation between the transfer matrix and
the Hamiltonian involves the lattice spacing ǫ in the time direction which tends to zero,
ǫ ˆH + O(ǫ2). A simple limit of ˆT in equation (39) is obtained
ˆT = exp(
ǫ ˆH) = ˆ1

The critical line of the two-dimensional anisotropic classical system, obtained through
duality i.e. when the relation sinh 2Ks sinh 2Kt = 1 is fulﬁlled,
is equivalent in
t )−1 = λc = 1 when equation (37) is also
the extreme anisotropic limit to 2Ks(2K ⋆
used. Fluctuations in the ground state structure have their origin in the competition
between two non-commuting terms in the Hamiltonian. In expression (40), the term
λ ˆσz(j) ˆσz(j + 1) acts like a ferromagnetic interaction which reinforces order in the z-
−
direction (order parameter) in the chain, while ˆσx(j) appears as a disordering ﬂipping
term. When λ > 1, the ordering term dominates and we expect ferromagnetic z-order
in the ground state, while the disordered phase corresponds to a dominant role of the
ﬂipping term when λ < 1.

relation at long wavelength with slope unity) and is necessary in order to compare later with conformal

The eigenstates of ˆH may then be classiﬁed according to their parity, P =
1,
ˆP
and an obvious
consequence is that ˆH has vanishing matrix elements between states of diﬀerent
parities. More generally, for any even operator ˆE such that ˆE ˆP = ˆPˆE, the only
possibly non vanishing matrix elements of ˆE are between states of the same parity
while odd operators satisfying ˆO ˆP =
ˆP ˆO have surviving matrix elements between
states of opposite parities. The ground state of the system is expected to be even (it
is of the symmetry of the Hamiltonian itself), so that a measure of local order in the
system is given in agreement with equation (15) by

Matrix elements of ˆσz(j) ˆσz(j + 1) might have been chosen as well. The reason for
being mainly interested in the bottom of the spectrum (see ﬁgure 3) lies in the fact
that the quantum phase transition takes place at zero temperature. Together with
the eigenstates already mentioned, we deﬁne the state
and the
corresponding relation which ﬁxes the value of the sound velocity,

3.3. Small Chains

A quantum chain of length L corresponds to an inﬁnitely long ladder or strip of
classical spins si,j. In the case of a chain of 2 spins with periodic boundary conditions
(the classical counterpart is thus a cylinder), the Hamiltonian may be written

2 ˆH = λ ˆσz(1) ˆσz(2) + λ ˆσz(2) ˆσz(1) + ˆσx(1) + ˆσx(2).

The relevant energy levels and corresponding matrix elements for three small sizes
are collected in table 2. Use will be made of these results to get approximate values
of the critical exponents in the discussion in section 5.

4. Quantum Potts chain

The Potts model generalizes the Ising model. The sites are occupied by Potts variables
(abusively called spins) with q diﬀerent states, ni,j = 0, 1, . . . q
1, and bonds between
nearest neighbour sites may have two diﬀerent energy levels, depending on the relative
states of the site variables, e.g.

1).

where the fact that interactions are limited to nearest neighbours allows a factorized

Now ˆT is a qL
qL matrix (each of the L spins ni,j have q diﬀerent possible

δ{νj },{ν′

We have shifted the sum in the last term, starting from p = 1 which only changes
the transfer matrix by a constant prefactor eK ⋆
t . This modiﬁcation aﬀects the free
energy density (or the Hamiltonian) by a constant only and does not change the
thermodynamic properties. In the Hamiltonian limit Ks →

It is easy to check that in the case q = 2, we recover the Hamiltonian (40) of the
quantum Ising chain with ˆC playing the role of ˆσz and ˆR that of ˆσx. The limit

We proceed as in the Ising case to get the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. The classical
Potts model is obviously globally unchanged by the cyclic transformation
1j,
0j. Such a rotation in spin states is realized by the operator ˆRj.
1j →
We may thus deﬁne a charge operator which simultaneously rotates Potts variables at
all sites,

Using the commutation relations between the ˆRj’s and the ˆCj’s, it is easy to prove
that the charge operator commutes with the Hamiltonian. Since the eigenvalues of ˆRj
are the q distinct complex numbers ωj = e2iπrj /q, those of the charge operator are also
j 2iπrj/q) which enable to write the Hamiltonian matrix
given by q numbers exp(
under a block-diagonal structure with q diﬀerent sectors, depending on the value of

Local order parameter = ˆCj, or ˆC

critical exponent xǫ. For the order parameter, although the two choices correspond to
diﬀerent values of p, since two critical exponents are suﬃcient in order to determine
the whole universality class, the same value of xσ is expected from both deﬁnitions.

The results, collected in table 4 in the case of the Ising, 3
state Potts models,
show as expected a very weak convergence. A strip of width 2 to 4 is obviously a
poor approximation of the thermodynamic limit. In the case of the Ising model, exact
diagonalization [8, 12] through Jordan-Wigner transformation into fermion operators,
then Bogoljubov-Valatin canonical transformation into free fermions leads to an exact
expression for the energy density [13]

Unfortunately, there is no closed expression for the order parameter matrix element
which couples two diﬀerent sectors of the Hamiltonian. Hence, the presence of a
boundary term breaks the quadratic expression necessary for the diagonalization.

The resort to gap scaling as predicted from conformal invariance is thus desirable.
With the normalization of equation (40) the fermion excitations take the form
. The sound velocity is thus ﬁxed to unity as previously announced.

are collected in table 5. The quality of the results is indisputably better than through
FSS.

In the case of the Potts model, the sound velocity is not known and it is worth
referring to the literature. Gehlen et al. have studied numerically quantum Potts
chains in refs. [7, 14] where tables of numerical results are reported for q = 3 up
to a size L = 13 and for q = 4 up to L = 11 (they denote R (P ) the energy
gap (magnetic gap) multiplied by the strip size) . These authors used a diﬀerent
normalization and their Hamiltonian for q = 3 in [14] is related to ours through
ˆ1 = ˆHGehlen(q = 3), while in [7] it is related to ours through
ˆHhere(q = 3) + 4
2
3
3
ˆHhere(q = 4) = 2 ˆHGehlen(q = 4). Using the values of the sound velocity quoted in [7],
we deduce that in our case the sound velocity is 3/2 larger for q = 3 and 2 times larger
for q = 4, i.e.

vs(q = 3) = 1.299,

vs(q = 4) = 1.578.

(81)

These values are used to calculate the exponents reported in table 5. Further numerical
values denoted with an asterisk are taken from refs. [7, 14] to complete the table with

results at larger sizes. The expected result in the thermodynamic is also mentioned
in the table [15].

To summarize, we note that the quality of the results is acceptable for the
relatively small eﬀort of diagonalization of small matrices. The quest for critical
exponents is an important step in the characterization of the nature of a phase
transition, since these quantities are universal. The study of models of statistical
physics which display second-order phase transitions usually requires sophisticated
methods, and approximate determinations are often desirable. Considering quite small
systems, we reach a few percent accuracy in the determination of the critical exponents
in the case of the Ising and 3
state Potts models. The convergence is poor in the
4
state Potts case. This is essentially due to the logarithmic corrections present in
this model.

Eventually, regarding the relatively small eﬀorts, we believe that an introduction
to the study of quantum chains in courses on statistical physics or many-body problems
might be of interest.

Workshop Presentation and Hot Topics

Alessandro B. Romeo

Onsala Space Observatory

Chalmers University of Technology

SE-43992 Onsala, Sweden

Abstract

The workshop ‘Astrophysical Dynamics 1999/2000’ followed a homonymous ad-
vanced research course, and both activities were organized by me. In this opening
paper of the proceedings book, I describe them and document their strong impact
on the academic life of the local institutions.

1 Introduction

The advanced research course was held at Chalmers University of Technology and G¨ote-
borg University in October–December 1999; it was open to graduate students, senior
researchers, and motivated under-graduate students with good background in physics
and mathematics. The course covered several multi-disciplinary issues of modern research
on astrophysical dynamics, and thus also of interest to physicists, mathematicians and
engineers. The major topic was gas dynamics, viewed in context with stellar dynamics
and plasma physics. The course was complemented by parallel seminars on hot topics
given by experts in such ﬁelds, and open to a wide scientiﬁc audience. In particular, I gave
a friendly introduction to wavelets, which are becoming an increasingly powerful tool not
only for processing signals and images but also for analysing fractals and turbulence, and
which promise to have important applications to dynamical modelling of disc galaxies.
The course is presented in more detail in Sect. 2. The basic reference is Romeo (1999b);
see also the references cited therein and in Sect. 2, and Romeo (1999a) for a discussion of
my ideas about teaching (in a diﬀerent context).

The workshop was held at Onsala Space Observatory on 12 and 13 January, and 1
March, 2000; it was open to a wide scientiﬁc audience. The workshop with published
proceedings book was, as a matter of fact, the innovative form of exam that I proposed
for the advanced research course. The contributions were refereed and their quality is
high on average, exceptionally high in a few cases. The workshop is presented in more
detail in Sect. 3.

The advanced research course and the workshop all together produced great enthusi-
asm in the students and welcomed the participation of a hundred diﬀerent people, which
means an order of magnitude more than an average graduate course at Chalmers Univer-
sity of Technology and G¨oteborg University. What else should I say? Enjoy reading the
proceedings book!

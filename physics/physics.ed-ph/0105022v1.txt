The Phase Diagram of QCD

Abstract: I use simple thermodynamic reasoning to argue that at temperatures of
order a trillion kelvin, QCD, the theory which describes strongly interacting particles
such as protons and neutrons under normal conditions, undergoes a phase transition
to a plasma of more elementary constituents called quarks and gluons. I review what
is known about the plasma phase both from theoretical calculations and from exper-
iments involving the collisions of large atomic nuclei moving at relativistic speeds.
Finally I consider the behaviour of nuclear material under conditions of extreme
density, and discuss possible exotic phenomena such as quark matter and color su-
perconductivity.

1 Introduction

For over 25 years, our best theory of the strong interaction responsible for binding
together protons and neutrons within the atomic nucleus has been Quantum Chro-
modynamics, or QCD for short. QCD treats nucleons not as fundamental objects
in their own right, but as composite states of size roughly 1fm 1 made from more
elementary particles called quarks. Quarks have spin- 1
2 and come in several varieties,
or ﬂavors; the two lightest quarks are the up quark u, which carries an electric charge

Note that we specify both “constituent” and “current” quark masses, a distinction to
be explained below. Constituent and current masses can diﬀer considerably for the
lighter ﬂavors u, d, s – the origin of the O(104) factor between heaviest and lightest
current masses is as yet not understood. With an eye to the charge and constituent
mass assignments of Table 1, we can identify a proton as a uud bound state with net
charge +e and the neutron as udd with net charge zero.

The experimental support for this picture is two-fold. Firstly, the quark model
provides a very natural explanation for the multiplicity and pattern of strongly-
interacting particles (collectively known as hadrons) brieﬂy formed in high-energy
particle collisions [1]. Hadrons can be classiﬁed as either three-quark qqq states called
baryons, such as nucleons, or quark – anti-quark q ¯q states called mesons, the lightest
example being the pi-meson or pion, which occurs in three charge states π± and π0,
all with roughly one-seventh the mass of the proton. Apart from nucleons and pions,
most hadrons decay via the strong interaction and have typical lifetimes of O(10−23s).
Their variety can be accounted for by diﬀering combinations of quark spin and ﬂavor,

1fm stands for femtometre, also known as a fermi. 1fm = 10−15m.

as well as various radial excitation states. Secondly, the results of high energy inelas-
tic scattering experiments of electrons oﬀ nucleons are consistent with the presence of
pointlike spin- 1
2 constituents called partons, just as high-angle Rutherford scattering
of α-particles oﬀ atoms demonstrates the existence of the nucleus. The partons ap-

sprays or jets of particles, all with similar momenta, emerge from the event region.
These are most naturally explained by a single progenitor quark scattered in the orig-
inal high-energy collision, which subsequently decays into a profusion of lower energy
hadrons. Paradoxically, however, although quark constituents provide an economical
explanation of strong interaction phenomena, no experiment has ever revealed evi-
dence for an isolated quark, for instance via the observation of a fractionally-charged
object on a Millikan oil-drop.

ditions such as temperature and density are varied. Thermodynamical information is
often presented in the form of a phase diagram, in which the diﬀerent manifestations
or phases of a substance occupy diﬀerent regions of a plot whose axes are calibrated
in terms of the external conditions or control parameters. The most familiar example,
of course, is that of H2O shown in Fig. 2; the control parameters are temperature T
and pressure P , and the three regions correspond to the three phases of ice, water
and steam. The lines mark the various coexistence curves P (T ) where two phases are
in equilibrium; a phase transition such as melting or boiling is observed when moving
along a path in the (T, P ) plane which intersects such curves. Two special points
in the diagram are the triple point (Ttr = 273.16K, Ptr = 600Nm−2) where all three

phases coexist, and the critical point (Tc = 647K, Pc = 2.21
meniscus separating liquid from vapour disappears, and the two ﬂuid phases become
indistinguishable. For T < Tc the transition between liquid and vapour is ﬁrst-order,
implying discontinuities ∆S and ∆V in entropy and volume respectively, and a non-
vanishing latent heat and interface tension. This classiﬁcation follows because entropy
and volume are both ﬁrst derivatives of the Gibbs free energy G(T, P ):

At the critical point the transition becomes second order, which means that singular-

In fact, each of the quantities in eqn.(1.2) diverges at the critical point. Another
interesting phenomenon is critical opalescence: the size of droplets of the liquid phase
within the vapour (or vice versa) becomes comparable with the wavelength of visible
light, implying large optical path diﬀerences between adjacent parallel rays of light
and hence strong scattering – the system thus becomes opaque near the critical point.
Just beyond the critical point, thermodynamic observables still vary very rapidly as
one moves about the (T, P ) plane due to the large values of CP and κT ; this is known
as a crossover region.

In
particle physics reactions a qqq baryon is always created or destroyed pairwise with
a ¯q ¯q ¯q anti-baryon. There is no process within QCD which can change the number of
baryons NB minus the number of anti-baryons N ¯B; in other words we can identify
N ¯B called baryon number. Quarks and

anti-quarks carry B =

allowed to vary, the most convenient themodynamic potential to consider is the grand

µB. Thermodynamic equilibrium is reached when
Ω is minimised, and for a system in equilibrium we recognise µ as the increase in E
whenever B increases by one. When systems are analysed using the grand canonical
ensemble µ is kept as a control parameter, and the baryon density nB = B/V is a
derived quantity whose value depends on the details of the equation of state nB =
nB(T, µ).

It is worth making two further observations. Firstly, baryons are fermions and

5

are hence governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, implying that no two identical
baryons can share the same quantum state. At T = 0 we thus expect baryonic matter
to be degenerate, implying that energy states are fully populated up to some maxi-
mum energy called the Fermi energy EF , in precise analogy with condensed matter
systems such as electrons in a metal. For weakly interacting baryons µ coincides with
EF . Secondly, QCD is a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, which means that in con-
trast with electronic systems the particles’ rest-energy should be taken into account;
we thus have µ = µN R + m0c2, where µN R is the non-relativistic chemical potential.
In the rest of this article I shall attempt to explain what is known about the phase
diagram, giving quantitative details wherever possible.
In the next section I will
review QCD at zero temperature and chemical potential, paying particular attention
to the question of why isolated quarks have not been observed, and why observed
baryon masses are considerably greater than the u and d current quark masses shown
In the bottom left-hand corner of the phase diagram where T and µ
in Table 1.
are both small the thermodynamic behaviour of QCD can be described in terms of
a vapour of hadrons, which as we have seen are composite states of quarks and/or
anti-quarks. The principal task for QCD theorists in this region is therefore to classify
and quantify the bound states; there is a sense in which this can be caricatured as
“relativistic atomic physics”. In section 3 I will use simple thermodynamic reasoning
to argue that this state of aﬀairs cannot persist as T is raised – eventually there comes
a point where either a transition or a crossover occurs to a phase where the dominant
degrees of freedom are no longer hadrons but the quarks themselves, together with
other partons called gluons. Since quarks and gluons play similar roles in QCD to
the electrons and photons of QED, this phase is often called the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP), and QCD in the upper-left region of the diagram shares much terminology
In section 4 I discuss where the QGP might be

only two candidates are the early universe, in the ﬁrst instants following the Big Bang,
and in high energy collisions between not elementary particles, but entire atomic
nuclei which are ﬁrst stripped of their attendant electrons and then accelerated to
relativistic speeds. Such experiments are currently being performed at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York, and still
more energetic ones are planned at the ALICE 2 detector at CERN in Geneva. Finally,
I switch attention along the µ-axis, where very little is known beyond the onset of

922MeV, given by the nucleon rest mass minus the binding
energy per nucleon, which is estimated from empirical models of nuclei such as the
liquid drop model. Once again, there is believed to be a phase transition at a larger
value of µ to a phase in which quarks rather than nucleons are the dominant degrees
of freedom. Such quark matter may conceivably be found at the cores of compact
astrophysical objects such as neutron stars. The nature of quark matter has recently
been the focus of intense theoretical interest; it has been speculated that Fermi surface
phenomena analogous to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS) instability, responsible
for superconductivity in metals and superﬂuidity in liquid 3He at low temperatures,
may play an important role. In the lower-right region of the phase diagram, therefore,
QCD becomes a branch of condensed matter physics.

The fundamental interaction between quarks in QCD arises from the exchange of
spin-1 particles called gluons g, shown schematically in Fig. 4. Gluons are present
inside hadrons and are thus also partons, but carry zero baryon number. Their
existence is indirectly conﬁrmed by the observation of particle collisions from which
3 jets emerge, one of which must result from a high-energy gluon formed in the initial
collision, subsequently decaying into a group of hadrons with net B = 0.

The prototype for the quark-gluon interaction is provided by a theory called Quan-
tum Electrodynamics (QED), which describes the force between electrically-charged
particles such as electrons in terms of exchange of massless neutral quanta of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, namely photons. It can be shown that the force between two
charges due to the single photon exchange process analogous to that shown in Fig. 4a
is described by a potential

V (r) =

(2.1)

where A is proportional to the product of the charges; in other words, single photon
exchange reproduces the Coulomb potential, and the resulting lines of electric ﬂux
between equal and opposite charges trace out the familiar dipole ﬁeld pattern, shown
in Fig. 5. In QCD the corresponding quantity is called chromoelectric ﬂux, and the

gluon is the quantum of the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic ﬁelds. By contrast
with QED, however, single gluon exchange in QCD only gives an accurate description
of the force between quarks at very small distances. At larger separation, things
become much more complicated because as well as interacting with q and ¯q, gluons
can interact with themselves (as explained below; see also Fig. 4b), in contrast to
photons which are electrically neutral and hence do not self-interact. The gluons’

the world’s most powerful computers [3]. Here we content ourselves with summarising
the result: it turns out that the potential between a q ¯q pair at separation r is

role in establishing QCD as the theory of the strong interaction.

As r increases the second term in (2.2) takes over, implying that the q ¯q potential

their angular momentum (which of course is quantised in units of ¯h), it is possible

At ﬁrst sight eqn.(2.2) suggests that the energy required to eﬀect complete sep-
aration of the quarks, that is, to “ionise” a hadron, is inﬁnite. This is not strictly
true, because at some point the application of a non-relativistic concept such as V (r)
to relativistic quarks must break down. Once the energy stored in the ﬂux tube be-
comes comparable to twice the rest-energy of a quark, it becomes possible to break
the string by q ¯q pair-production, the new particles acting as a fresh sink or source
for the broken ﬂux lines. The result is two q ¯q mesons, each with a smaller interquark
separation than the original energetic meson. This process of particle production
via string-breaking helps to explain the profusion of hadrons formed in high-energy
collisions.

Let us develop the analogy with QED a little further. The QCD quantity corre-
sponding to electric charge is called color, and comes in three forms: “red”, “blue”.
and “green”. Both quarks and gluons have color quantum numbers. Anti-quarks
have complementary colors “anti-red” (shown as cyan in Fig. 6), “anti-blue” and
“anti-green”. The gluon exchange responsible for QCD forces carries color between
diﬀerent particles; hence the colored nature of the gluons can be regarded as the origin
of their self-interaction. As well as providing the theory with its name, the slightly
frivolous terminology conveys in a heuristic way a deep dynamical principle of QCD.
Suppose we denote a green quark, for instance, by qg; the only stable ﬁnite-energy
systems are those formed from complementary combinations of color, such as qg ¯q¯g
mesons or qrqbqg baryons. The q ¯q pair formed in string-breaking is produced with

exactly the right color combination to maintain this overall color-neutrality. Forces
between color-neutral objects such as nucleons within the nucleus can be viewed as
a second-order eﬀect akin to Van der Waals forces between neutral atoms.4 From
our viewpoint the most important aspect is that colored objects such as isolated
quarks or gluons are never observed. This property of QCD, supported by all the
theoretical considerations of the previous paragraphs, and to date not contradicted
by experiment, is called color conﬁnement.

While a complete quantitative description of hadrons in QCD remains elusive, for
many practical purposes including the thermodynamic arguments to be developed in
the next section, a simpliﬁed treatment is both possible and desirable. The two crucial
ingredients we have identiﬁed, asymptotic freedom and color conﬁnement, are built
into a much simpler description of the strong interaction known as the Bag model,
in which massless quarks move freely within a spherical hadron of radius R, but are
prevented from travelling further by an inwards-acting pressure due to the conﬁning
nature of the bulk vacuum [6]. This can be modelled by assigning a constant energy
density Λ4
B to the non-conﬁning region within the hadron. The energy of a hadron of
radius R is then given by

the second term arising from the kinetic energy of the conﬁned quarks due to the
Uncertainty Principle. The hadron mass can be found by minimising E with respect
to R; eliminating the constant C one ﬁnds

We now come to another important aspect of QCD dynamics. When a particle
with spin ~s propagates, it is possible to deﬁne a quantity called helicity h = ~s.~k/

which is the projection of the spin axis along the direction of the particle’s motion,
deﬁned by the momentum ~k. For a spin- 1
2 particle like the quark, there are two

possible helicity eigenstates h =
2 , usually referred to as left- and right-handed
states since they are related by a mirror reﬂection. A quark’s helicity is not altered
by either emission or absorption of a gluon; hence in the absence of any other eﬀect
one might deduce that the numbers of left- and right-handed quarks are separately

conserved in QCD, leading to two good quantum numbers BL and BR. A moment’s
thought, however, shows that this can only be the case if quarks have zero mass and
hence travel at the speed of light. Otherwise, it is possible to Lorentz boost to a frame
in which the quark’s momentum has the opposite sign; since angular momentum along
the boost axis is not changed, helicity in the new frame must also have the opposite
sign. We conclude that in a relativistically covariant treatment massive quarks must
be described as a superposition of helicity eigenstates, the mass m parametrising the
R transitions. Since
overlap between them and hence eﬀectively the rate of L
in this case only B = BL + BR remains as a good quantum number, we say that
the chiral symmetry relating left and right-handed quarks and enabling them to be
thought of as independent particles is broken by the quark mass.

Chiral symmetry breaking (χSB), like that of other symmetries in many-body or
quantum ﬁeld theory, can occur via the theory’s own dynamics. We have seen that
QCD is responsible for a strong attractive interaction between q and ¯q. The force is
so strong, in fact, that the state usually considered as the ground state or vacuum,
namely that of no particle present, is actually unstable with respect to formation of a
condensate of tightly bound q ¯q pairs, much as the ground state of superﬂuid helium
is a Bose condensate of He atoms in the lowest quantum state. Let us denote the
vacuum by the ket

acting on a ket as ¯ψ, ψ respectively. A χSB vacuum is then given by

As eqn.(2.5) implies, the condensate pairs ψL with ¯ψR, and vice versa. Since
¯ψψ leaves BL + BR invariant but changes BL −
BR by two units, a non-vanishing
condensate implies that the latter quantity has no deﬁnite value in the vacuum and
only B remains as a good quantum number. A left-handed quark propagating through
such a vacuum can be annihilated by ψL, leaving ¯ψR to create a right-handed quark
with the same momemtum. The quark will thus ﬂip its helicity at a rate proportional
to
– in other words, it will propagate just as if it had a mass. We refer to this
dynamically-generated mass as the quark’s constituent mass Σ, as opposed to the
quark’s intrinsic or current mass m. If χSB occurs spontaneously by the formation of

although since isolated quarks are not observed, neither quantity is unambiguously
deﬁned. If we look at the values for the u and d quarks, however, we see that mu,d is
not very much larger than the electron mass 0.511MeV, whereas Σu,d is comparable
to one-third the nucleon mass 940MeV.

Spontaneous χSB in QCD is thus the agency by which the nucleon (and by exten-
sion the universe as a whole) acquires most of its mass. It is also a natural consequence
of quark conﬁnement [7]. Consider the bag model description of massless quarks mov-
ing back and forth within a small volume. At the surface of the bag the quarks must
reverse their direction of travel, but not their angular momentum, which is always
conserved. Therefore the interaction with the bag wall changes their helicity. Since
this cannot be achieved though any process involving gluon exchange between the
quarks in the bag, it must arise because the QCD vacuum in the volume outside
the bag contains a non-vanishing density of q ¯q pairs with which the bag quarks can
exchange helicity. Conﬁnement implies χSB.

A useful analogy for χSB is supplied by the phenomenon of ferromagnetism in
metals. On each atom of the metal, occupying a site of a regular crystal lattice, there
is an unpaired electron carrying a magnetic moment or “spin” conveniently denoted
. Quantum mechanical exchange forces dictate that there is a tendency for spins

on adjacent sites to align, although the preferred direction of alignment (ie.
) is not determined by the microscopic Hamiltonian. However, if the temperature
↓↓
is low enough (ie. T < Tc, the Curie temperature), then cooperative interactions
amongst spins at arbitrary separation result in a ground state in which a macroscopic
fraction of the spins is aligned, resulting in the spontaneous magnetisation of the
sample M =
= 0 (angled brackets here denote a thermodynamic average rather
than a quantum expectation value). Since the magnetisation axis deﬁnes a particular
direction in space, the original symmetry of the Hamiltonian under rotations of the
spin axis is spontaneously broken by M
= 0. The same eﬀect can be promoted by
an external magnetic ﬁeld h
= 0, which in this case explicitly breaks the symmetry.
The relation between M and h exactly mirrors that between

and m in QCD.

It is interesting to examine the spectrum of excitations above the ferromagnetic

hadrons, the next lightest meson made from u, d quarks being the ρ at 770MeV, and
lightest baryon being the proton at 938MeV. The π is not exactly massless due to
= 0. 5 The π plays a special role in QCD –
the explicit χSB introduced by mu,d 6
its lightness provides the most direct evidence for a vacuum with χSB, and many of
its interactions were predicted purely on symmetry grounds alone, long before the
dynamics of QCD were worked out in any detail, or the theory even formulated.

3 The Quark-Gluon Plasma

A natural consequence of the composite nature of hadrons in QCD is that there
should be a phase transition as temperature T is raised. Let us start by considering
QCD with just u and d quarks, and ignoring the heavier ﬂavors. If there is no net
concentration of baryons (ie. B = µ = 0), then the dominant hadronic degrees of
freedom in a hot medium are initially pions π±, π0, which carry zero B and can be
relatively easily pair-produced. If we neglect their rest mass, which is accurate for

expression for a plasma of free light quarks and massless gluons which are no longer
conﬁned within hadrons is much larger, because there are so many more degrees of
freedom (ie. the plasma is a state of higher entropy):

¯q pairs there are 2 helicity states
The numerical factors require explanation: for q
each, 2 ﬂavor states (u and d), and 3 color states. The factor 7
4 arises due to the
diﬀerence between Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics. For g, there are 2 helicity
states and 8 color states (this is because gluons carry a combination of color and anti-
color). Now, naively we expect the hadron gas and quark-gluon plasma to be in

The model we have used is crude, in eﬀect treating the inside and outside of the
bag as diﬀerent phases. More reﬁned calculations of the transition to the QGP are

made using the lattice gauge theory techniques mentioned in the previous section.
In Figs. 7, 8 and 9 we show the results of recent calculations performed on QCD
with varying numbers of light quark ﬂavors [9]. Fig. 7 shows the energy density

170MeV, and rapidly reaching a plateau at roughly
80% of the SB value. This is strong evidence for QGP formation at Tc ≃
170MeV,
εc ≃
, in rough agreement with the bag model estimates. The disparity
between the high-T phase and a non-interacting plasma, however, is reinforced by
Fig. 8, which shows that for T <
3Tc the pressure falls appreciably below the SB
∼
value. Strong interactions between q, ¯q and g persist in the QGP. Only at very high
temperatures when large energies are exchanged in inter-particle collisions will the
interaction strength weaken due to asymptotic freedom, making calculations using
the single gluon exchange approximation feasible.

and L is small, signalling that the energy of an isolated color source diverges, ie.
conﬁnement. Across the transition this behaviour reverses itself indicating both that
chiral symmetry is restored and that color is no longer conﬁned in the QGP. Also

shown are the associated susceptibilities deﬁned by χL =

and, as second derivatives of the free energy, peak or even diverge at a phase transition.
It is a remarkable fact that these two a priori distinct transitions appear to coincide,
as revealed by the merging of the peaks in Fig. 9.

The dominant degrees of freedom in the QGP are thus light q, ¯q and g, which
justiﬁes in retrospect the bag model treatment used previously. In terms of the q ¯q
potential (2.2), the QGP is characterised by the vanishing of the string tension K;

our attention to u, d and s.
In the limit mu,d →

order parameter which vanishes in the QGP, just like the magnetisation M of a
ferromagnet which vanishes at the Curie point. We have thus labelled “hadronic”
and QGP phases in Fig. 3 by the value of
(shown in red). Another legitimate
question is the order of the phase transition; the large latent heat predicted by the
bag model indicates a strong ﬁrst order transition. However, our simple treatment
has ignored any possible variation with temperature of the bag constant ΛB itself. In
fact, lattice calculations with 3 light quark ﬂavors reveal ∆ε to be much smaller than
the bag prediction and hence the ﬁrst-order transition much weaker; ∆ε may even
vanish altogether if ms is suﬃciently large, ie. the transition is actually second order
for just two light ﬂavors [11]. Now, since mu,d 6
strictly
never vanishes, but rather drops steeply in the transition region. For this reason we
have indicated QGP formation along the µ = 0 axis in Fig. 3 as a crossover rather
than a true phase transition, with a possible critical point ending a line of ﬁrst-order
transitions somewhere within the (T, µ) plane. It should be stressed, however, that
further numerical work is needed before this picture can become conclusive.

4 Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions

Having discussed the reasons for supposing that a new state of strongly-interacting
matter exists, we should now consider how it might be observed, which translates
into the question of where to ﬁnd or how to produce temperatures of O(1012K). A
natural place to look is immediately after the Big Bang, when the energy density in the
early universe considerably exceeded any found naturally today. In the ﬁrst moments,
energies were so high that all matter was highly relativistic; under these circumstances
integration of the Friedmann equations governing the universe’s expansion predicts
that the radius R of the observable universe is related to the time after the Big Bang t

and temperature T via R
2 ; at later times when matter cooled and became
non-relativistic the behaviour changed over to R
3 . We can use this information to
extrapolate back from present conditions to predict that the QGP last existed between
10−5 and 10−4s after the Big Bang. This is beyond the range of direct observation,
which cannot penetrate beyond the epoch when the cosmic microwave background
105 years. The transition from quarks to hadrons
radiation was formed at roughly t
may have left a footprint, however, if it were ﬁrst order. In this case, because of the
non-zero interface tension between the phases, the transition would have proceeded
inhomogeneously, eg. via the growth of bubbles of the hadronic phase at isolated
points within the QGP. This would have resulted in local ﬂuctuations in baryon
concentration, which possibly had a signiﬁcant impact on the relative abundances of
light elements formed at the nucleosynthesis epoch at t

10 minutes [12].

∼

In recent years, however, most attention has focussed on the possibility of recre-
ating the QGP in terrestrial laboratories in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, ie. high
energy collisions between nuclei such as sulphur (S), lead (Pb) and gold (Au) [13].
The ﬁrst experiments have been performed with ﬁxed target nuclei at the Alternat-
ing Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) in Brookhaven and the Super Proton Synchrotron
(SPS) at CERN, with centre of mass (CM) energies of 2A and 18AGeV respectively
(A is the number of nucleons in the nucleus). Last year experiments with colliding
nuclear beams commenced at RHIC in Brookhaven, taking advantage of the higher
energy of 200AGeV available in the CM frame; experiments are due to start at the
ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in 2006, this time
with a CM energy of 5500AGeV. The regions of the phase diagram probed by these
experiments are indicated schematically by blue crosses in Fig. 3. The collisions
are incredibly complex events, producing O(103) charged particle tracks at SPS and
RHIC energies and forecast to produce O(104) at ALICE, and their study presents
a stringent challenge to data acquisition and storage techniques. An end-on view of
the charged tracks, ie. viewed along the beam, from a recent event observed at the
STAR detector at RHIC is shown in Fig. 1.

∼

The various stages of a heavy-ion collision are portrayed in Fig. 10. The colliding
nuclei are envisaged as spherical in their rest frame, but in the CM frame are Lorentz-
contracted along their direction of motion due to their relativistic velocity β = v/c:
even at SPS energies the length contraction factor γ(β)
10, so the nuclei are best
pictured as “pancakes” (see Fig. 10a). When the nuclei meet, the initial events are
high-energy inelastic collisions between individual nucleons, in which many partons

is the energy density ε produced in the mid-

If QGP is formed, it must quickly expand and cool due to its excess pressure with
respect to the vacuum. At some point, therefore, T falls below Tc, and hadrons reform
(Fig. 10c). At around this point the composition of the hadrons formed, the major-
ity of which are pions, is ﬁxed – this is known as chemical freezeout. The resulting
hadronic gas continues to cool until interaction rates become insuﬃcient to maintain
thermal equilibrium in the expanding medium; this is known as thermal freezeout,
from which point the hadrons are free to stream away to be detected (Figs. 1,10d).
Information about conditions inside the ﬁreball must be inferred from hadrons emit-
ted from the surface of last scattering at thermal freezeout, just as conditions in the
early universe must be inferred from observations of the microwave background. Ev-
idence for thermalisation comes from analysis of the distribution of transverse mass

variety of diﬀerent hadron species. Particularly useful information is carried by pairs
of identical particles such as π−π−. The wavefunction of such identical bosons must
be symmetric with respect to exchange of momenta; the resulting correlation enables
the size of the collision region to be inferred from the momentum spectrum of the
emitted particles [13]. The principle is identical to the two-photon intensity interfer-
ometry used to estimate stellar diameters in astronomy [17]. The combined results of
these analyses suggest a freezeout temperature T <

Since it is plausible that thermalisation occurs in heavy-ion collisions, and that
the temperatures reached are of roughly the same order as Tc, it is legitimate to
consider possible signals for QGP formation. The ﬁrst is so-called J/ψ suppression
[19]. Although charmed quarks are too heavy to be abundant in thermal equilibrium,
they can be pair-produced in the initial high-energy collisions to form c¯c mesons, of
which the J/ψ at 3097MeV is the lightest – in the vacuum it is relatively long-lived
since it can only decay into lighter hadrons via an intermediate pure-glue state which
is hard to produce. Now, bound states of heavy quarks c, b, t are non-relativistic,

22

and the static potential V (r) of eqn.(2.2) is much more appropriate for these systems
than it is for mesons made from light quarks [20]. A consequence of QGP formation is
that (2.2) is replaced by the screened potential (3.4): the c¯c pair will thus dissociate
if the screening length λD falls below the analogue of the Bohr radius for the J/ψ.
If this happens charmed quarks will be far more likely to form mesons with open
charm such as the D (c¯u, c ¯d), and hence fewer J/ψ mesons should be produced
in heavy-ion collisions as compared to similar energy pp collisions. The number of
J/ψ’s produced can be estimated via the fraction which decay not to hadrons but
to pairs of muons µ+µ−. Muons are particles of mass 106MeV which do not feel
the strong interaction; though unstable, they survive long enough to emerge from
the ﬁreball and be detected. A compendium of recent results is shown in Fig. 11
[21], where the suppression factor is plotted against the number of nucleons Npart
participating in the ion collision, which is proportional to the energy density reached.
Note that J/ψ suppression is expected even in the absence of QGP, due to dissociation
on collision with other particles in a hadronic medium, and can be observed in pA
collisions. This eﬀect can be modelled by assuming a uniform decay rate integrated
along the length of nuclear material traversed by the J/ψ before it emerges into the
vacuum. The horizontal line in Fig. 11 is normalised to this model expectation; there
is anomalous suppression for Npart ≥
130, which is strong evidence for quark-gluon
plasma formation.

Another striking observation, strangeness enhancement, comes from analysing the
relative abundances of hadron species in the collision products; it is found that many
more hadrons containing s and ¯s quarks are produced in ion collisions than in similar
energy pp or pA collisions. Data from the WA97 experiment at the SPS (Fig. 12) show
enhancement factors for Λ (uds), Ξ (ssd) and Ω (sss) baryons and their corresponding
anti-baryons, showing that eg. Ω production is enhanced by a factor of 17 for ion
102 [22]. What is the origin of this eﬀect? It has been proposed
collisions with Npart ≥
that s¯s pairs will be much easier to produce in the QGP than in a hadronic medium
[23], both because they are considerably lighter due to chiral symmetry restoration,
and because of the much higher density of gluons, which opens up new formation
s¯s. Note that the current mass ms is very
processes such as gluon fusion gg
similar in magnitude to Tc, which means that strangeness production should be a
very sensitive function of T near the transition. Experiments currently under way at
the NA57 detector at SPS will explore intermediate values of Npart, in the hope of
ﬁnding a threshold for this eﬀect.

Heavy-ion collisions at the SPS have yielded signals not easily explained in terms
of purely hadronic physics. If the QGP has been seen, however, its lifetime is prob-
ably O(1fm/c), comparable with the time taken for its formation following ther-
mal equilibration. The current experiments at RHIC promise to produce QGP’s at
T
400MeV, with 4 times this lifetime, those at ALICE perhaps up to 10 times,
making possible a detailed study of the QGP independent of artifacts induced by the
proximity of the phase transition. Interpretation of J/ψ suppression (and the equiva-
lent phenomenon in the Υ family of b¯b systems), and strangeness enhancement should
become more clear-cut; additional observations such as thermal photon emission (ie.
blackbody radiation) directly from the QGP will become feasible. Higher energies will
also create jets, and their interaction with and penetration of the plasma will yield
much important information. Finally, improved detector techniques will enable more
detailed study of other thermal eﬀects, such as the downward shift and broadening
of the ρ meson resonance [24], due respectively to partial chiral symmetry restora-
tion and collision-broadening9 in a hot hadronic medium. In more ways than one,

5 Quark Matter and Color Superconductivity

I now consider the behaviour of QCD as a function of chemical potential µ. For T
strictly zero as µ increases, the ground state is initially the state with no particle
the vacuum. This situation persists until µ reaches the value of the
present, ie.
nucleon rest mass minus the binding energy per nucleon in nuclear matter, when it
becomes energetically preferable to populate the ground state with a bound nucleon
ﬂuid. Ignoring Coulomb repulsive forces between protons,10 this energy can be es-
timated from nuclear physics as 16MeV/nucleon; therefore we can identify an onset
922MeV at which point baryon density nB jumps from zero to nuclear den-
value µo ≃
0.16fm−3. Since the vacuum and nuclear matter coexist at this point, the
sity nB0
≃
value µ = µo corresponds to the “room chemical potential” that would be measured
∂Ω
should we ever be able to construct a suitable potentiometer! Because nB =
∂µ ,
the discontinuity implies a ﬁrst order phase transition. We expect the transition to
persist for T
= 0 on grounds of continuity, and therefore show it as a coexistence line
emerging from µ = µo in Fig. 3. As it now separates a phase in which baryons can
be present but are dilute from one in which they are condensed, it is known as the
nuclear liquid-vapour transition [8, 25]. It is anticipated that the line ends at a critical
O(10MeV); it is possible that critical opalescence has been detected
point with Tc ≃
near this point in the form of the broad distribution of fragment sizes observed in
medium-energy nuclear collisions [26].

V

What happens as µ, and hence nB, increase? Unfortunately the lattice gauge
theory simulations which were so useful along the T -axis become ineﬀective once
= 0. For densities up to 2 - 3nB0 we can extrapolate from
applied to QCD with µ
our current knowledge of nuclear physics [27]. Beyond that we are forced to rely on
approximate treatments such as the bag model [8]. As nB increases we again expect
a transition from a phase in which matter exists in the form of nucleons to a higher
entropy phase where the dominant degrees of freedom are quarks. Naively this should
occur at densities of the order of a billion tonnes per teaspoonful where the volume
per baryon equals the baryon volume, and the bag surfaces just touch. For degenerate

when the mean time between collisions is less than the natural lifetime.

10Electromagnetic interactions, of course, play a pivotal role in determining the size and stability
of atomic nuclei, and are also important in modelling neutron star interiors. On the energy scales
depicted in Fig. 3, however, it is reasonable to neglect them.

conductivity (bottom)

Let’s discuss the nature of this quark matter (QM) phase. In the bag model, the
QM phase corresponds to the bag interior in which chiral symmetry is restored and
quarks are light. That this might be so on more general grounds is illustrated in the
upper part of Fig. 13, where χSB is shown as due to a pairing instability between
quarks and anti-quarks of equal and opposite momenta; the ¯q are here interpreted as

26

holes in the Dirac Sea of negative energy states. χSB occurs if the binding energy of
the q ¯q pair exceeds the energy needed to excite them: the result is the modiﬁed single-
particle excitation spectrum shown at upper right, with an energy gap 2Σ between the
highest occupied and lowest empty states. Now when nB > 0, some positive energy
states are also occupied, as shown at bottom left; we refer to these as belonging to
the Fermi Sea. It is impossible to excite q ¯q pairs if the q state has momentum k < kF
and is hence already in the Fermi Sea; such pairs are Pauli-blocked. At some point,
therefore, available q ¯q states require so much energy to excite that it is preferable to
revert to a chirally symmetric ground state. Since kF
mu,d, we deduce the
quarks near the Fermi surface which participate in QM’s interaction with other forms
of matter are highly relativistic.

Where might QM be found? If the sequence of phases outlined above is correct,
then only at the onset µ = µo does pressure P =
Ω/V vanish, implying that nuclear
matter at this point is stable and self-bound. To reach the higher densities needed for
QM an external pressure is needed; the most likely source is the gravitational binding
in the compact astrophysical objects of mass O(1030kg) and radius O(10km) known
as neutron stars [27]. Neutron star central densities are estimated as lying in the
range 5 - 10nB0. It turns out that the maximum mass a neutron star can have before
becoming unstable with respect to further gravitational collapse to form a black hole
depends on how compressible its material is, as determined by the equation of state:

P V Γ = constant.

masses have not exceeded 1.4M⊙, which does not exclude models for their structure
which include a QM core [30]. It may well turn out that our best experimental probe

Much recent interest has been aroused by the idea that QM might have richer
properties than those of a simple relativistic fermi liquid. Consider the lower panel
of Fig. 13: if the qq interaction is even weakly attractive at the Fermi surface, then
another pairing instability, the so-called BCS instability, is expected between quark
pairs at antipodal points, leading to a ground state with a non-vanishing diquark
condensate
= 0 [32, 33, 34]. Analogously to χSB, the instability leads to an
energy gap 2∆ between highest occupied and lowest vacant one-particle states, the
distinction being that this time the gap is located at the Fermi surface. In metals
at temperatures of a few kelvin, a BCS instability can arise between Cooper pairs
of electrons due to an attractive force arising from interaction with vibrations of the
underlying crystal lattice of positively-charged ions. The Cooper pair condensate
leads to the phenomenon of superconductivity, signalled by electric current ﬂowing
without resistance in a narrow layer close to the sample surface; the screening eﬀect
of this supercurrent results in the Meissner eﬀect, namely the complete exclusion of
magnetic ﬁeld from the sample. A BCS instability between neutral helium atoms in
liquid 3He at milli-kelvin temperatures, on the other hand, leads to frictionless ﬂow
and quantisation of vorticity, a phenomenon known as superﬂuidity.

In QCD the force between two quarks due to single gluon exchange is attractive
(unlike single photon exchange between two electrons), implying that a weak BCS
instability should be present in QM [32]. More recent calculations which attempt to
model realistic strong interactions in the regime µ >
µc predict a much bigger eﬀect,
∼
with ∆ as large as 10 - 100MeV [35]. What physical consequences might arise? A
crucial consideration, not applicable to χSB, is that the qq wavefunction is constrained
by the Pauli Exclusion Principle. As a result the ground state is sensitive to the ﬂavor
composition of the available quarks. Suppose µ/3 is not much greater than ms; in
kF u,d and pairing is eﬀectively restricted to the two light ﬂavors. The
this case kF s ≪
diquark condensate which thus forms is [33, 34]

The quark spins are combined in an antisymmetric singlet state; the overall antisym-

acting on ﬂavor a, b = 1, 2 and color α, β = 1, . . . , 3 indices. Now, since the qq2SC
11It has been suggested that catastrophic consequences might follow if SQM were produced at rest

wavefunction is not color-neutral, we infer by analogy with the electrically-charged
Cooper pair that the ground state is color superconducting. The most immediate
consequence is that out of the eight gluons, the ﬁve which carry color #3 acquire a
mass of O(∆) and hence cannot penetrate QM over distances much greater than a
∆−1, in direct analogy with the Meissner eﬀect in metallic super-
screening length
conductors.12 The three gluons left massless carry combinations of only the ﬁrst two
colors. The qq2SC wavefunction however, like the QGP, respects chiral symmetry;
for this reason although the superconducting description will be the more natural for
T <
∆, there may well be no true transition separating 2SC and QGP phases, and
∼
we have shown them separated by a crossover in Fig. 3.

For larger µ, kF s should increase up to the point where strange quarks can par-
ticipate in the pairing. In this case a more symmetric “color-ﬂavor-locked” (CFL)

If anything the CFL state is still more exotic [33]; all 8 gluons are rendered massive
implying color superconductivity, and chiral symmetry is also broken. Moreover,
since the qqCF L operator either creates or annihilates two units of baryon number, B
is no longer a good quantum number – it can be shown that this B-violation leads
to superﬂuidity. The CFL state is currently believed to be the stable ground state of
matter as µ

, and is shown as a distinct phase in Fig. 3.

Observational and experimental evidence for these fascinating new phases may be
diﬃcult to acquire. Since neutron star temperatures are typically <
10MeV, it may
∼
seem that they are a natural place to look. However, two factors work against us; even
if a neutron star has a QM core its bulk is probably normal nuclear matter, and color
superconductivity is a phenomenon conﬁned to the vicinity of the Fermi surface rather
than the whole Fermi Sea and therefore has relatively little impact on the equation
of state. Both imply that any eﬀect of color superconductivity is likely to be quite
subtle. One prediction is that a color superconducting core would stabilise neutron
star magnetic ﬁelds and prevent them from decaying over cosmologically signiﬁcant
timescales [36]. Another speculation concerns the formation of a neutron star by core
collapse of a very massive star during a supernova explosion [37]. During this violent

a consequence of the condensation of a scalar Higgs ﬁeld and gives W ± and Z 0 bosons masses of
O(100GeV), restricting the eﬀective range of the weak interaction to 10−18m.

will be Pauli-blocked, with the eﬀect of making the core eﬀectively transparent to
neutrinos. They may emerge from the collapsing core in a sudden burst, rather than
steadily diﬀusing out over 10-20 seconds as in standard collapse scenarios; it may be
feasible to detect such a burst in terrestrial neutrino detectors.

6 Conclusion

In this article I have explained how the study of the strong interaction has spawned
a new ﬁeld, QCD thermodynamics, and argued that the resulting phase diagram
may be surprisingly rich. An interesting feature for both T > 0, µ > 0 has been
the important role played by the strange quark; the ﬁne details of Fig. 3 may be
very sensitive to the precise value of ms. One aspect we should return to is the
possibility of a second critical point in the (T, µ) plane, whose existence follows if we
assume that the thermal transition is continuous or a crossover, whereas the density
transition is ﬁrst order [28]. Its location is hard to calculate using present technology
(0.8Tc, 0.6µc) [29]), but is expected to move to the left as ms
(one estimate is
decreases; recall that for 3 light quarks it should merge with the T -axis to produce a
ﬁrst-order thermal transition. It has been proposed that various critical phenomena
in the vicinity of this point could be detected in RHIC collisions [38]. The reason
that the strange quark has such a big inﬂuence on QCD thermodynamics is that ms
1fm−1
is of the same order of magnitude as the “interesting” QCD scale 200MeV
which has cropped up repeatedly in our discussion. This scale characterises all QCD
phenomena not described by single gluon exchange; there is a sense in which it is the
scale at which the strong interaction becomes “strong”.

Apart from the obvious attraction of exploring new states of matter, why is it
important to continue study in this direction? Firstly, QCD is an exceedingly chal-
lenging theory, and the experiments and observations I have sketched provide a new
arena in which to test its predictions. It is gratifying how far we can get via fairly
simple thermodynamic arguments, coupled with insights from relativity and quantum
theory. However, it is also a particularly satisfying area to work in for theorists using

systematic calculational techniques such as lattice gauge theory, since by and large
their theoretical predictions still pre-date (and hence inform) experiment, rather than
lag behind by, in certain cases, several tens of years. Secondly, QCD thermodynamics
deals with the only phase transition in particle physics which will ever be studied un-
der laboratory conditions. Phase transitions in other particle physics contexts, such
as electroweak or grand uniﬁed theories, are believed to have played a crucial role
in the ﬁrst instants of the universe following the Big Bang; they have been invoked
in mechanisms to account for the large-scale structure of the universe as revealed by
the distribution of galaxy clusters, the observed excess of matter over anti-matter,
and also the period of early exponentially rapid expansion invoked to account for the
observed homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background. A quantitative under-
standing of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics in these models
will be required before the full story can be told; QCD oﬀers our sole opportunity of
thoroughly testing that understanding.

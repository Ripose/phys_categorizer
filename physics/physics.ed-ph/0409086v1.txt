Abstract

We describe a 8085 microprocessor interface developed to make reliable time period
measurements. The time period of each oscillation of a simple pendulum was measured
using this interface. The variation of the time period with increasing oscillation was
studied for the simple harmonic motion (SHM) and for large angle initial displacements
(non-SHM). The results underlines the importance of the precautions which the students
are asked to take while performing the pendulum experiment.

Introduction

The simple pendulum is a very trivial experiment that physics students do in higher secondary.
Yet students sometimes fail to appreciate why ”the initial angular displacement of the pen-
dulum must be small”. Interesting letter to the Editor in Physics Education (UK) point that
the pendulum’s time period increases by only 1% for pendulum’s oscillating through 30o. A
1% increase means the time period is 10msec more for than a pendulum undergoing SHM
whose time period is 1sec, thus students do question the very need of the precaution that
the pendulum should only be given small angle initial displacements. Variations as small as
10msec are very diﬃcult to measure using stop-watches. Since computers (or microprocessors)
can in principle make measurements in micro-seconds, we were tempted to study the simple
pendulum using a micro-processor.

2 The interface

The microprocessor is essentially made up of digital devices, which communicate among itself
in ones (1) and zeros (0). That is voltage signals of preferred
in the language of binary, i.e.
levels. To ﬁnd the time interval of an oscillating pendulum, we keep an arrangement of laser
source and light dependent resistor (LDR) such that the pendulum’s bob cuts the light path
during its oscillation. As the bob cuts the path, the light is momentarily blocked. This
produces a change in current generated in the LDR. For the microprocessor to communicate

1arunp92@yahoo.co.in, arunp92@physics.du.ac.in

and understand this change (analog) in current, it has to be converted to TTL compatible
digital voltage. The conversion and subsequent wave shaping is done using the circuitry shown
in ﬁg(1).

Figure 1: Circuit used to wave-shape and interface instant of pendulum’s cross-over in front
of the light dependent resistance (LDR).

The value of resistance of the LDR, as the name suggests, depends on whether light is falling
on it or not. The resistance of the LDR is usually inversely proportional to the intensity of
light falling on it [1]. In our case when the laser light was falling on the LDR, it’s resistance
was 15KΩ, while on switching oﬀ the laser light it rose to 150KΩ. The voltage drop across
the 10KΩ resistance which forms a voltage divider with the LDR is 5v when the laser light is
’ON’ (bright phase) and 0.75v when LDR is not exposed to laser (dark phase). This voltage
(Vo1) could have been directly fed into the microprocessor, however, the intensity of the laser
light strongly depends on the current supplied by it’s batteries. With time since the current
is likely to fall, the voltage Vo1, would change as the experiment is being conducted. The
diﬀerence ampliﬁer, ampliﬁes the diﬀerence between the voltages Vo1 and V1. By selecting a
proper V1, using the pot, the output Vo2 varies from positive level for dark phase and negative
level for the bright phase. This inversion is bought about by the inverting ampliﬁer (opamp).
The second opamp inverting action brings Vo3 in phase with Vo1. This opamp is essentially a
Schmitt’s trigger, which hard drives the output to +12v and -12v. The output of the second
opamp (Vo3) varies from -12v to +12v in accordance with the motion of the pendulum. Since,

2

the microprocessor can only understand zero or high state (∼ +5v), a 4.7v zener diode is used
to protect the the microprocessor (from +12v) by converting +12v level to +4.7v and to force
-12v level to zero. The 1KΩ resistance kept between the opamp and zener diode is to control
the current ﬂowing into the zener diode.

Figure 2: Plot of pendulum length vs time period squared (T2). The data point fall on a
straight line with co-relation factor as good as 0.9995.

The realibilty of our microprocessor program (listed in the Appendix) was checked by
ﬁnding the frequency of known square waves fed from audio function generators. The program
is essentially a counter program which counts the time interval taken between two positive
edges of a train of square waves. While counting, the program loops between instruction
addresses C024H and C02DH for the square wave’s high state and between C02EH and C037H
for the input square wave’s ground state. The latter part was to over come the requirement
of IC555 monostable trigger hardware in our circuitry. For a count of ’N’, the time period is

where ’f ’ is the frequency of the microprocessor clock in MHz. The formula is obtained by
calculating the ’T’ states or time taken for the microprocessor to execute each instruction. It
should be noted, the microprocessor’s program takes 17µsecs to identify an edge and write the
count in a memory location. This 17µsecs is a systematic error that would be present in the
value of time period measured. From this exercise we realized the quartz crystal used as a
clock for the microprocessor kit was 6.2MHz (Books [2] state it is 6MHz, however, it depends
on local manufacturers). Thus, results of all time measurements (ﬁg 2, 6, 8 and 11) have to
be multiplied by 0.968(=6.0/6.2) to accommodate this correction.

While the realibility of the software was established, to make sure the LDR (our transducer),
as also our microprocessor interface was reliable, we measured the time period of oscillation
for various pendulum lengths. Figure (2) shows a perfect linearity between the pendulum’s
length and it’s time period squared (i.e. T2). This is expected and is in accordance to well
established theory that we shall discuss below.
It should be noted that on an average the
response time of a LDR is in small milli-secs. Thus, the ability to resolve and measure any
changes in time period with increasing oscillations would be in milli-secs. Also, the accuracy in
terms of absolute value of ’g’ calculated from experimental data would depend on how accurate
the quartz crystals frequency has been reported.

3 Simple Harmonic Motion: small initial displacement

Before proceeding to discuss the results of our experiment it would be worthwhile to recapulate
about the pendulum and under what conditions does it’s motion reduce to a simple harmonic
motion. A pendulum is easily set up by suspending a point mass. Physically, this is achieved
by suspending a bob which has an appreciable mass but whose radius is small as compared to
the length of the string used to suspend the bob in consideration. The pendulum is set into
to and fro motion by displacing it from it’s mean position. The forces acting on the displaced
pendulum is shown in ﬁg(3). The restoring force is given as

where ’m’, ′Θ′ and ’g’ are the mass of the bob, it’s angular displacement from the mean position,
the acceleration due to gravity respectively. The above leads to the equation of motion

On considering the initial angular displacement i.e. Θ to be small, sinΘ of eqn(2) reduces to

The above equation shows the proportionality between T2

o and the pendulum’s length. To
conﬁrm the reliability of our time measuring device (interface and software etc), we conﬁrmed
this relationship, see ﬁg(2). This relationship holds true for small angle displacements. Hence,
the data for ﬁg(2) were collected for various lengths of the pendulum with initial angular
displacement being 5o, an universally accepted small angular displacement.

Students identify eqn(4) easily, since it is used by them to estimate the acceleration due to
gravity. Also of interest is the fact that the above expression implies that the time taken to
complete one oscillation is independent of the angular displacement (Θ), abide subjected to the
condition sinΘ ∼ Θ. It’s here that the argument starts as to what would be the appropriate
initial displacement that a experimentalist should give to attain the simple harmonic motion?
As Θ (in radians) increases, the disparity between itself and it’s sine (sinΘ) increases. This
fact is seen in ﬁg(3), where the increase in disparity is shown in terms of error ( Θ−sinΘ
Θ , in %)
w.r.t. Θ.

As can be seen, the error is below 10% for angles less than 45o. Would this limit be
acceptable? Before answering this question, as to understand the boundary between SHM
and non-SHM, we proceed to understand the modiﬁcations introduced in eqn(4), when the
pendulum is set into motion with large angle displacements (non-SHM).

4 Pendulum with large initial displacement

The time period of oscillation of a pendulum oscillating with large angles can be found by
solving eqn(2), i.e.

d2Θ
dt2 = − ω2 sinΘ
However, that is easier said then done. Infact discussions on large amplitude oscillations are
rarely carried out because there are no analytical solutions for the above diﬀerential equations.
Infact, the solution is expressed interms of elliptical integrals [3, 4]

where To is the time period had the SHM condition been satisﬁed and is given by eqn(4)
and Θm is the maximum angular displacement given to the pendulum. Eqn(7) would suggest
that take whatever initial displacement you want while doing the experiment to determine the
acceleration due to gravity, all you have to do is to include the correction (Θ2
m/16) in the time
period expression (eqn 2).

tially calculated from ’T’ of eqn(7) while the constant line is ’g’ evaluated using To =

While the pendulum and it’s time period of oscillation in itself is interesting, it is usually
used to evaluate the acceleration due to gravity. Teachers insist that students do the experiment
with small angular displacements. Students do this without appreciating ”why” and as to
”what is a small angle”. Let us consider what kind of variation is expected theoretically if this
precaution is not adhered to. Figure(4) shows the plot of the variation of acceleration due to
gravity with the initial displacement done by numerically solving eq(5) [5]. The values of ’g’
represented by the solid line is essentially calculated from ’T’ of eqn(7) while the constant line is

’g’ evaluated using To =
m/16 (i.e. time period after correcting for large angle displacement).
1+Θ2
As the ﬁgure shows, with increasing angular displacement, the error in evaluated ’g’ grows.

Eqn(7) suggests only a trivial consideration of including a correction factor is required if
the small angle precaution is not followed, the question then arises ”why fuss over small initial
displacements?.” Also, it is evident from ﬁg(4) that the error in ’g’ would be below 10% for
initial displacements below 45o which is quite a large angle. This might be well within the
limits of experimental error, induced by your measuring devices like scale and stop-watch. It
should be noted that Nelson and Olsson [6] have determined ’g’ with an accuracy of 10−4 using
a simple pendulum by including as many as 8-9 correction terms. Thus, the importance of
maintaining small initial displacement while performing the experiment is still not convincing.

In the next section we report the measurements made by our microprocessor interface and try
to address the questions we have asked above.

5 Results & Discussion

Figure 5: Important instances for measuring one complete oscillation, with reference to our
experiment.

A bob of radius 2.5cm was suspended using a cotton thread of length one meter (the length
of the pendulum thus is 1.025m). As the pendulum cut the lasers path to the LDR, an electric
pulse is generated. From the point of the onset of the positive edge, the microprocessor counts
the time elapsed till the bob cuts the light path again. In one complete oscillation, the bob
cuts the light path thrice, say at instances to, t1 and t2 (see ﬁg 5). The time period is given
as t2 − to. The program is however designed to store t1 − to and t2 − t1. This was done to
make sure there is no error induced due to the inability to pin point the mean position of the
pendulum. Data were collected for the pendulum oscillating with the initial displacements of
5o, 10o, 15o, 20o, 25o and 30o.

Fig(6) shows the variation of the pendulum’s time period with oscillations. While for small
initial angles, there is no or slight variation in time period, for large initial displacements,
namely 20o, 25o and 30o, the fall in time period with increasing oscillations is pronounced.
The fall is better appreciated by plotting the normalized data (T/T1). Deviation from the
smooth variation in time period (scattering of data points) is seen for large angles. This
primarily is due to the pendulum’s support not being perfectly stationary. For this reason we
restrict our report to maximum angular displacement of 30o.

The fall in time period seems exponential. Since the experiment is not ideal, one can expect
damping to play a role (the decrease in amplitude was visible to the naked eye with increasing

exponentially with time. Thus, eqn(7) can be written as

(eqn 7) with co-relation factor as good as 0.985.

Instead of using coeﬃcient ’a’ as a variable for curve ﬁtting, it should be taken as a constant
(To, the SHM time period) deﬁned by eqn(4). That is, for all six values of Θ (Table I), the
value of ’a’ should work out to be the same. However, this proved to be a diﬃcult exercise
where we were not able to achieve good co-relation between the experimental data points
and the ﬁtted curve. To overcome this, after obtaining the generalized coeﬃcients (a, b)
we calculated T(β = 0) (=a+ab, listed in Table I), i.e. the time period of the pendulum’s
oscillation through large angles without any damping (the variation with angle of oscillation is
given by Bernoulli’s approximation eqn 7). Fig(7) shows the variation of T(β = 0) with angle.
The solid line shows the curve ﬁt (eqn 7). The To determined from our experimental data
works out to be 2.00545sec. One can use this value in eqn(4) and determine the value of ’g’,
the acceleration due to gravity. We get the acceleration due to gravity as 9.963m/sec2. This
value is on the higher side. Even after accounting for the inﬂuences corrections terms discussed
in reference [6], the value of ’g’ would be on the higher side. The error, might be due to the
lack of precise knowledge of the micro-processor’s clock frequency. Using eq(1) and eq(4), we
get the maximum possible error as

For an error of +0.1 × 106MHz is the knowledge of the micro-processor’s clock frequency, the
maximum error in ’g’ would be +0.65m/s2. Thus the error, as stated, is due to the imprecise
knowledge of the micro-processor’s clock frequency.

We now investigate the remaining coeﬃcients ’b’ and β. The coeﬃcient ’b’ is proportional

nearly perfectly (co-relation factor is 0.984) on a parabola. The proportionality constant by
eqn(8) should be 1/16 (if Θ is in degrees), or 1.9 × 10−5rad2. Our result gives the proportion-
ality constant as 1.4 × 10−5rad2 (or 1/21). Eqn(8) is only an approximation hence, we can
conﬁdently say that our data follows the solution given by Bernoulli (eqn 7).

The second graph of Fig(8) shows the plot between the damping coeﬃcient and the angular
displacement. The damping factor is nearly constant for small angular displacements which
shows a rapid linear increase for angular displacements above 20o. As can be seen the variation
is similar to that of the IV characteristics of a diode and as in it’s case, we can extend the
linear region to cut the ’X’ axis and look for the limiting initial angular displacement which
does not show sharp exponential fall in oscillation time period. This works out to be 11 − 12o.
Beyond this limit, the damping coeﬃcient is large and a pronounced exponential fall is seen
in the oscillation’s time period (ﬁg 6). Kleppner and Kolenkow [7] have discussed the nature
of β and have stated that it depends on the shape of the mass and the medium through
which the mass moves. The amount of frictional force depends on the instantaneous velocity
(dΘ/dt) of the pendulum (β being the proportionality constant). However, this nature of the
frictional force (F = −βdΘ/dt) is restricted for motion where velocity is not large enough to
cause turbulence. Beyond angles of displacement of 11 − 12o, the frictional drag might not be
following the linear relationship with velocity. This however needs further investigation.

Before summarizing the results of our experiment, it would be of use to understand how
the pendulum experiment is done in the undergraduate lab. The student records the time
taken to complete 40-50 oscillation [8] oscillations from which the time period is calculated by

dividing the total time taken by the number of oscillations measured in that time. We call
this as Tav (average). This term obviously does not take into consideration the inﬂuence of
damping which is pronounced in large angle oscillations. This obviously leads to erroneous
results. Figure (9) compares Tav and T(β = 0), the time period after accounting for damping
with the pendulum’s displacement. The ﬁgure clearly depicts the increasing disparity with
large displacements.

Thus, if a student performs the pendulum experiment without taking the necessary pre-
caution of small angular displacement to get simple harmonic motion and in turn To, he or she
would have to ﬁlter out the large angle correction and the damping coeﬃcient. If no correction
is made and ’g’ is calculated using Tav (listed in Table II), the variation in ’g’ with angle Θ,
would increase (ﬁg 10 iii). The fall in time period with successive oscillations is evident in
this experiment, since a micro-processor measures the time period. This would not have been
evident in ordinary circumstances. Thus, the experimenter would not have been obvious of this
and would only inco-operate large angle corrections, with no corrections regarding damping.
The resulting variation is seen as the falling value of ’g’ with angle in ﬁg(10 ii). The true
constant nature of ’g’ (ﬁg 10 ii) is only obtained when both corrections are inco-operated.

Table II: Listed is the average time period Tav that a student would measure manually
along with the time period if he bothers to correct it for large angle oscillations. Also listed
are the values of acceleration due to gravity he would have got with his time periods.

what corrections have been done and it’s variation with initial angular displacement.

Conclusion

By doing the pendulum experiment with large angle displacements, calculations become com-
plicated. As much as two informations have to be ﬁltered out, the eﬀect of large angle displace-
ment and the damping factor. The damping coeﬃcient is related to the initial displacement
itself. These informations can only be processed if the time period of each oscillation is mea-
sured. This is quite impossible manually and only a micro-processor interface is capable of
highlighting these features.

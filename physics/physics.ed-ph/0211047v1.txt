Abstract

The driven inverted pendulum undergoes stable oscillations if the drive amplitude and frequency

are large enough. This classroom demonstration is best used in junior or graduate level Classical

Mechanics courses. This paper reintroduces the equation of motion of the driven pendulum, gen-

eralizing to arbitrary driving angle. The pendulum will oscillate about a stable angle, other than

straight down, if the drive amplitude and frequency are large enough for a given drive angle. We

will explore what is meant by “large enough.” Emphasis is given to parameters associated with a

simply made demonstration apparatus.

INTRODUCTION

The general theory of the driven inverted pendulum is given in Landau and Lifshitz1

and other advanced mechanics texts, and has been reviewed in this journal, starting with

Refs. 2,3, and recently in Ref. 4. (See Ref. 4 for further citations.) An inverted pendulum

demonstration was described in Ref. 5.

The UC Riverside demonstration inverted pendulum, number M17Q in the Department of

Physics demonstration collection6, is a 25cm (L = 0.25m) long rod mounted on a saber saw

with a stroke (2A) of one inch, so the drive amplitude is A = 0.0127m. The demonstration is

designed to be clamped to a table top as shown in Fig. 1, but becomes more interesting when

hand held. (This is essentially the demonstration suggested in Ref. 5.) We will examine the

stability of this system as a function of the angular frequency, the amplitude of the driving

saber saw, and the angle of the driving saw from the vertical.

This type of demonstration is best used in junior level Classical Mechanics when introduc-

ing Lagrange’s Equations to ﬁnd the equations of motion. Examples of driving the support

of a simple pendulum harmonically either in a vertical or horizontal plane can be introduced,

but only to set up the equation of motion7,8. The actual solution for the motion can be fur-

ther investigated using a computer simulation or solution by the more inquisitive students.

The same apparatus can be used in an advanced graduate course in Classical Mechanics

where the harmonically driven pendulum is used as an example in presenting Lagrange’s

equations, and as a source of exercises. The Landau and Lifshitz1 section on “Motion in a

rapidly oscillation ﬁeld” uses vertically and horizontally driven pendulums as problems, and

introduces the technique we use to solve for arbitrary drive angles in sections III and V.

This demonstration apparatus can at best impress, and at worse confuse lower division

students, but will never be understood at that level. It does provide an excellent example

of how lecture demonstrations could and should be used in advanced classes. Although I

had seen the demonstration and played with it during many years of teaching the freshman

sequence, it wasn’t until I taught junior Classical Mechanics that I could ﬁnd a way to show

the device to illustrate an approachable problem.

It was after showing the inverted pendulum, clamped to a table top, that I came upon

the subject of this paper. While holding the saw in my hand, with the power still on, I

lowered the saw and observed the peculiar behavior of the pendulum as it found new stable

angles of oscillation as the drive angle changed. Tipping the plane of the pendulum’s motion

is simply equivalent to lowering the eﬀective value of g, but changing the driving angle in

the plane of the pendulum’s motion introduces the new and interesting problem addressed

here.

II. THE EQUATION OF MOTION OF THE PENDULUM DRIVEN AT ANY AN-

The dynamics of driven inverted pendulum near θ = 180◦ are described in Refs. 1,2,3,

etc. Here we generalize the problem to arbitrary driving angles.

The geometry of the problem is illustrated in Fig. 2. A thin rod pendulum of length L

is driven at its end (pivot) by a displacement with amplitude A, angular frequency ω, at an

angle of θd from vertical downward. The angle of the thin rod is measured by the generalized

coordinate θ also measured from the vertical downward.

The angle of the rod θ could have been measured from the driving direction, θd. However,

only for two values of θd (0 and π) will the equilibrium angle of the pendulum be θd. For

any value θd there is a stable point for small ω and A at θ = 0. So we choose to measure

the pendulum angle θ from the vertical downward.

The kinetic energy and potential energy of the rod can be written in terms of one gen-

eralized coordinate θ. The energies are separated into the motion of the center of mass

plus rotation about the center of mass. We ﬁrst need the Cartesian coordinates of the

center-of-mass expressed in terms of the generalized coordinate θ.

From this we get the velocity components of the center of mass.

III. EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL

Next we introduce an eﬀective potential to help us understand the physical origin of the

stability of the inverted pendulum, and to parameterize the condition for stability at any

driving angle.

Landau and Lifshitz1 separate the motion of the horizontally or vertically driven pendu-

lum into two parts: (a) a fast component ξ(t) at the drive angular frequency ω, and (b) a

slow component φ(t) which describes the slower overall swinging of the driven pendulum.

θ(t) = φ(t) + ξ(t)

(9)

The angle φ is deﬁned as zero downward, as was θ, while ξ is the diﬀerence between θ and

φ. In what follows we assume that the average of ξ(t) (denoted ξ) is zero, and that ξ(t) is

small compared to the slow motion φ(t).

The equation of motion for a pendulum driven at any angle (8) can be rearranged.

We have separated the angular acceleration into a time dependent driving part f (θ, t) oscil-

lating at the driving angular frequency ω, and a time independent part F (θ) corresponding

to gravity. Eq. (10) can be written in an expansion in ξ for small values of ξ(t).

(Note that ¨ξ is ω2 larger than ξ(t), so the terms in ξ may safely be ignored. Also both the

The ﬁrst term in the potential energy is simply gravity acting on the center of mass of the

pendulum. The second term comes from the dynamics of the forced motion, and representing

the average kinetic energy of the rapidly driven oscillation of the pendulum about its center

of mass. As the pendulum deviates from the drive angle (θd) the angular kinetic energy of

the pendulum about its center of mass increases.

The kinetic energy associated with the driving angular frequency, treated as an eﬀective

potential energy, stabilizes the slow motion of the inverted pendulum. Fig. 3 shows the

eﬀective potential as a function of φ for a driven inverted pendulum with R = 1.75, as

it is for UC Riverside demonstration M17Q. In Fig. 3 we see the gravitational potential
minimum at φ = 0 and also the dynamic potential minimum at φ = 180◦.

If the drive

amplitude or angular frequency become too small (R
1), then the stable equilibrium at
φ = 180◦ disappears. (Note that the local maximum near 125 degrees limits the amplitude

≤

of slow oscillation of this particular case of a driven inverted pendulum.)

The same physical interpretation of the driven wobble of the pendulum as a stabilizing

eﬀective torque is seen in Eq. (14) which includes a stabilizing part depending on ω2 which

originated in the kinetic energy of rotation at the driving angular frequency ω. (This is

basically the same as the way in which centrifugal force in orbital motion originates from

rotational kinetic energy about the center of mass when reducing to a radial equation of

motion.)

IV. SPECIAL CASES OF THE DRIVE ANGLE

Let us look at three special cases before moving on to general values of θd. These three

examples will provide some guidance in interpreting the result for an arbitrary driving angle

We get stable small oscillations only if R > 1 or equivalently ω > ωc. The UC Riverside

driven inverted pendulum has fp = 0.86f0 = 1Hz, or about half the frequency when driven

hanging down (θd = 0).

Appendix A reviews the traditional treatment of the inverted pendulum starting with
Eq. (8). The solution of the linearized equation of motion for θd = 180◦ gives the Mathieu
functions9 with well known properties. Only for a limited range of drive amplitude and

angular frequency do we get stable oscillations of the driven inverted pendulum. The range

of stability is usually displayed in terms of Mathieu parameters (see Fig. 15 in Appendix A).

Fig. 4 displays the regions of stability of the Mathieu functions plotted in terms of pen-

dulum drive parameters A and ω for the UC Riverside demonstration with L = 0.25m. The

lower smooth curve in Fig. 4 is approximately Aω = 1.81m/s. The point is at approximately

the operating point of the UC Riverside (30Hz,0.5inch). Note that we should also avoid large

driving amplitudes (A > 0.08m) for a 25cm rod. The eﬀective potential technique of Landau

and Lifshitz1 is also not valid for large drive parameters, so does not address an upper sta-

bility limit. A numerical solution of the equation of motion (8) is needed to explore shorter

bars (or large driving amplitudes) together with slow oscillation angular amplitudes larger

than the linear approximation supports.

Full numerical simulations of the equation of motion (8), including ad hoc frictional
damping, for both θd = 0 and θd = 180◦ are shown in Fig. 5. Appendix B presents the

technique used to generate these simulations, and others shown below.

Fig. 6 shows for very short rods that interesting, non-oscillatory behavior results. The UC

Riverside demonstration appears to be unstable in numerical solutions for any rod length

less than 4cm. This suggests other studies of overdriven parametric systems which can be

simply realized with a driven mechanical pendulum. Previous studies10,11 could easily be

extended to arbitrary drive angles using the analysis in section V below.

This equation gives small oscillations near φ = 0 only if ω < ωc or R < 1.

However, if ω > ωc (R > 1), the term in parentheses is negative, and there cannot be

Setting the torque equal to zero at φ = φ0 gives the same equilibrium condition as Eq. (25).

Requiring a positive curvature of the potential is equivalent to Eq. (26).

The eﬀective potential for R = 0.75 < 1 is shown in Fig. 7(b), where the only minimum in

the potential is at φ0 = 0.

The full numerical simulation matches the simpliﬁed model giving stable oscillation near
55◦ in Fig. 8(a) for R = 1.75. Taking the same system with a drive angular

frequency of 123rad/s (corresponding to R = 0.75 < 1) only gives stable oscillation about
zero degrees when the drive angle is θd = 90◦ in Fig. 8(b).

The horizontally driven pendulum (θd = 90◦) is

stable hanging down (φ0 = 0) for R < 1, and

stable near φ0 = cos−1(1/R) for R > 1.

The condition for equilibrium in Eq. (28) can be easily solved for θd as a function of

φ0, which can be a multivalued function. However, we wish to know the stable angle of

oscillation φ0 as a function of the drive angle θd.

Simply ﬁnding the solutions of Eq. (28) is not suﬃcient. The zeroes must correspond to

real angles and to stable equilibriums as deﬁned by Eq. 29. Applying all necessary tests leads

us to use “Procedural Programming” in Mathematica in the form of the Block structure.

(See Appendix C.)

Fig. 9(a) shows that the UC Riverside inverted pendulum demonstration has a range of

drive angles for which there are no (nearby) stable equilibrium angles. For all values of

R

2 there is a stable equilibrium φ0 for all drive angles θd. The critical case R = 2 is

≥

shown in Fig. 9(b). For values of R > 2 the curve representing φ0(θd) becomes smooth,

tending to a straight line as R

. (But we must beware of instability appearing at larger

→ ∞

drive parameters, equivalent to large R. There are practical limits to how large R can be to

give a stable driven pendulum in a physical system.)

If we plot all solutions up to 360◦ in φ0 (Fig. 10), we see that in the range of missing angles
in Fig. 9(a) there are corresponding points which would be stable for θd + 180◦. The original
problem shown in Fig. 2 has this two-fold ambiguity of drive angles at θd and θd + 180◦. In

practice our apparatus limits the motion of the rod so that we cannot observe oscillation for

θd

φ0

> 90◦.

−
The UC Riverside demonstration M17Q with R = 1.75, has no stable equilibriums in the
range 110◦ < θd < 160◦. Observed and calculated equilibrium angles agree within reason (see

table I). This demonstration apparatus has ﬁxed drive amplitude (A) and angular frequency

(ω), so only the rod length L is adjustable. Shortening the stick on the demonstration to

20cm would give R = 2.18 assuring stable oscillation for any value of θd.

The value R = 1 (ω = ωc) deﬁnes the minimum condition for stable inverted oscillations.

Fig. 11(a) show the stable angles φ0 as a function of drive angle θd for R = 0.90. Only
drive angles below 90◦ give stable oscillations. (Note also that the stable angle for θd = 90◦

becomes φ0 = 0 for R
1.) Fig. 11(b) shows that for R = 1.2 there is a small range of
θd’s near 180◦ for which stable inverted oscillation is possible, but only for small angular
deviations from 180◦.

≤

Finally we graph in Fig. 12 the actual motion for R values of 0.90 and 1.20 both with
θd = 180◦ and θ0 = 170◦. As expected the case of R = 0.90 < 1 swings down to eventual

equilibrium at φ0 = 0, while for R = 1.20 > 1 there is a limited range of stable inverted

oscillation.

VI. THE EMBRY-RIDDLE DEMONSTRATION

The desire for more degrees of freedom on a limited budget has led to the Embry-Riddle

Aeronautical University driven pendulum demonstration shown in Fig. 13. A small hand-

held variable speed Jig Saw (0 to 3200 strokes per minute) with an peak-to-peak amplitude

of 0.7 inch. Converting to the units used here gives values of ω and A to be used in equations

and simulations.

0 < ω < 335rad/s

A = 0.00889m

Modern saber saws oﬀer a similar range of stroke rates, but with a peak-to-peak amplitude

of 1 inch, at about 3 times the cost. The UCR demonstration saber saw has a more limited

range of speed adjustment. We have made rods with lengths of approximately L = 10cm,

20cm and 30cm. The L = 20cm rod gives R as large as 3.2, well into the regime where the

driven pendulum is stable at all driving angles.

The rods are made out of light wood (sections of a meter stick or yard stick) with a hole

near one end reinforced by a small metal grommet. The reinforcing is to reduce wear at the

pivot. A wide jig saw blade has a small hole drilled near the end. A brass screw, washers and

nuts are used to loosely fasten the rod, allowing it to swing freely12. The whole mechanism

is light enough that the jig saw can still reach its maximum stroke rate.

The R value can be measured using Eq. (25).

φ0 = cos−1 1
R

for

R > 1

Hold the driving saw blade horizontally and measure the angle to which the driven pendulum

rises. At low driving speeds it will oscillate about the downward direction. Once ω > ωc

the pendulum will slowly rise with increasing drive speed until a maximum angle is reached.
Any angle above 60◦ will correspond to R > 2, which gives stable driven oscillations at any

driving angle. We have used this method to measure the maximum R of each of our larger

pendulums. The 20cm pendulum, shown in Fig. 14, has a measured maximum R of 3.2,
corresponding to φ0(90◦)

72◦.

Fig. 14 shows the 20cm ERAU pendulum driven with θd = 135◦, having damped into a
118◦. The smallest pendulum as a maximum R value above

steady position near φ0(135◦)

≃

40. At lower driving rates (lower ω decreases R) it displays the behaviors expected from

a driven pendulum. However, at the fastest speed of the jig saw it rotates at about one

revolution per second about the driving support. Asymmetry of the pendulum determines

the chirality of the motion, as ﬂipping the pendulum over on the support screw reverses its

rotation. It would appear that friction limits the rate of rotation below what one might

expect from Fig. 6.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The pendulum driven at any angle can be studied using the eﬀective potential method of

Landau and Lifshitz for rapid driving angular frequency (ω

ωp). The condition for stable

oscillation can be established using the eﬀective potential Eq. (15).

Numerical simulations of the full equation of motion Eq. (8) generally conﬁrm the results

of the simpliﬁed model for high driving angular frequencies ω

ωp. General behavior of the

pendulum driven into small oscillations at any driving angle is summarized by the parameter

All parameters of the driven pendulum are accessible over interesting ranges with simple

frequency ω. Even g can be reduced by tipping the plane of oscillation. We have explored

more parameter sets than reported here, and hope that others will explore and report their
own variations of the driven pendulum at angles other than 0◦ or 180◦.

Design your driven pendulum to display the range of behaviors you are interested in, and

use this demonstration (and others) in upper division and graduate mechanics classes.

APPENDIX A: APPROXIMATE ANALYTIC SOLUTION OF THE INVERTED

PENDULUM

Section IV B introduced the solution of the inverted pendulum based on the eﬀective po-

tential approach of Landau and Lifshitz. This system can also be easily solved by linearizing

the equation of motion as in Ref. 3.

We can start with the general equation of motion for the driven inverted pendulum

APPENDIX B: NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE GENERAL EQUATION OF

MOTION

In the linear approximation, stability or instability of the equation of motion was inde-

pendent of the amplitude of the motion. When we cannot safely use sin θ

θ, then we must

use a numerical solution.

cluding the case shown in Fig. 16(a) with θ0 = 185.7◦. Fig. 16(b) shows that the case of
θ0 = 121.4◦ is just barely unstable, falling to oscillation about 0◦, the downward direction.

Our demonstration pendulum limits the rod’s motion to the range of about

when it strikes the mechanical stop it leaps back upward, sometimes into stability.

The real demonstration has damping which quickly reduces oscillation to the point where
the inverted pendulum remains upright at θ = 180◦. The following two calculations consider

both constant frictional damping (torque opposing rotation) and viscous drag (proportional

to angular velocity).

The constant friction form gives a rapid linear decrease in oscillation amplitude, while

the viscous damping gives the familiar under-damped oscillation with an exponentially de-

This equation of motion with constant friction (B1) can be solved for initial conditions
[we choose θ(0) = θ0 and ˙θ(0) = 0] using NDSolve as shown here. Note that the drive

amplitude A, the driving angular frequency ω, and the rod length L are all input in SI

units, allowing simulation of a design before actually making the apparatus.

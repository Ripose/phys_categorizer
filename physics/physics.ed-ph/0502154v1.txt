Abstract

In in this paper we show how using D.A. it is found a simple change of variables (c.v.) that brings
us to obtain diﬀerential equations simpler than the original one. In a pedagogical way (at least we
try to do that) and in order to make see that each c.v. corresponds to an invariant solution (induced
by a symmetry) or a particular solution, we compare (with all the tedious details, i.e. calculations)
the proposed method with the Lie method. The method is checked even in odes that do not admit
symmetries.

Keywords: ODEs, D.A., Symmetries.

D.A. has usually been employed in diﬀerent areas (ﬁelds) such as engineering problems, ﬂuid mechanics
etc... and these problems are always described by partial diﬀerential equations (pde) (see [1]-[10]). This
method (“tactic”) helps us to reduce the number of quantities that appear into an equation and to
obtain ordinary diﬀerential equations (ode). We would like to point out (emphasize) that this tool is
more eﬀective if one practices the spatial discrimination, such tactic allows us to obtain better results
than with the standard application of D.A. (see [11]). Knowing that D.A. works well in pde we would
like to extend this method to the study of ode (the ﬁrst order in this case) in a systematic way. There
are in the literature previous work in this direction for ode of ﬁrst order (see [12]-[13].

The method of the Lie groups it has showed as a very useful tool in order to solve nonlinear equations
(nl-ode) as well as pde (see [14]-[27] ). Nevertheless, when one is studying ode of ﬁrst order its application
results very complicated (very tedious) if one has not a computer algebra package since if one decides
to look for the possible symmetries of an ode with pencil and paper this task may be turned very
exhausting. However, if we know that an ode admits a concrete symmetry, then it is a trivial issue to

ﬁnd new variables which allows us to rewrite the ode in quadratures or as we will see in this paper to
obtain an ode with separating variables.

Our purpose in this work is to explain, through examples, how D.A. works in order to ﬁnd these
changes of variables (c.v.) in a trivial way, i.e. without the knowledge of the symmetries of the ode
under study. The idea is as follows. When we are studying an ode form the dimensional point of view,
we must require that such ode veriﬁes the principle of dimensional homogeneity (pdh) i.e. that each
term within the equation have the same dimensions, for example, speed, or energy density. To clarify
+ x, where each term must have dimensions of y′ i.e.
this concept we consider the following ode, y′ =
[y′] = yx−1, where [
. As we can see, this ode does
] stands for dimensional equation of the quantity
·
·
not verify the pdh, since the term x has dimensions of x, i.e. [x] = x. In order to do that this equation
veriﬁes the pdh we need to introduce dimensional constants, in such a way that after rewrite the ode
in this example and as we can see easily
with these constants the ode now veriﬁes such principle i.e.
if we consider only one constant a, such that [a] = yx−2, we make that the ode y′ =
+ ax, veriﬁes
the pdh. We would like to emphasize that this situation does not appear (arise) when one is studying
physical or engineering problems since (as it is supposed) that such problems (equations) verify the
pdh and we do not need to introduce new dimensional constants, that must have physical meaning, for
example, the viscosity coeﬃcient, etc....

(t, u(t)) where

Precisely this dimensional constant suggests us the c.v. (x, y(x))

t = x, u = yx−2
in such a way that rewriting the original ode in these new variables it is obtained a new ode with sepa-
(cid:1)
rating variables: u + u′t = 1. The reason is the following. We know from the Lie group theory that if
it is known a symmetry of an ode then this symmetry bring us through a c.v. to obtain a simpler ode
(a quadrature or a ode with separating variables) and therefore the solution is found in a closed form.
To ﬁnd this c.v.
it is used the invariants that generate each symmetry, i.e. the ﬁrst principle is that
it is useful to pass to new coordinates such that one of the coordinate functions is an invariant of the
group. After such transformation it often (but not always) happens that the variables separate and the
equation can be solved in closed form. We must stress that taking the new dependent variables to be
an invariant of the group does not guarantee the separation of variables. The choice of the independent
variable is also very important.

(cid:0)

One must note that D.A. gives us this invariant (or at least a particular solution).

It is observed in
our example that the solution y = x2, (suggested by D.A.) is a particular solution for this ode, but if we
study this ode form the Lie theory point of view it is obtained that such ode has the scaling symmetry
X = x∂x + 2y∂y and therefore the solution y = x2, is furthermore an invariant solution (generated by
X), for this reason such c.v. works well. As we will show in the paper, the c.v. that D.A. induces is
the same than the generated one by the symmetries of the ode. In order to make see this fact, we will
solve each example by D.A. as well as by the Lie group technique (abusing of the trivial calculations),
calculating the symmetries and their corresponding invariants and c.v..

∈

However D.A. has a little (or rather big) drawback, it only gives us relationship of type power i.e.
R, and we cannot obtain relationship as y = (x + 1)n. Nevertheless, and as we will
y = xn, with n
see in the examples, although D.A. does not give us an invariant solution it will be suﬃcient that it
provides us a particular solution in order to obtain a c.v. which brings us to a simpler ode than the
original one. This task will be very useful in the case of studying Riccati and Abel odes. Furthermore,
this “tactic” is valid even in the case in which the ode has no symmetries but unfortunately one always
founds examples in which any tactic does not work.

The paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we describe (with all the tedious and superﬂuous
calculations), through two examples, how the proposed method works by comparing it with the Lie
method in order to show which are the symmetries and their corresponding invariants. In section 3 we
will show several examples beginning with a Bernoulli ode and following with two Riccati ode and three
Abel ode (see [28]-[32]). We think that these kind of ode are the most diﬃcult to solve and therefore

2

any simpliﬁcation is welcome. In section 4 we show two Abel odes that do not admit symmetries (see
[33]-[37]). In the ﬁrst of them we use the D.A. to obtain a particular solution that allows us to obtain a
Bernoulli ode but in the second one we are not able to ﬁnd any particular solution and therefore a c.v.
which brings us to obtain a simpler ode. We end with some conclusion as well as pointing out some of
the limitations of the proposed tactic.

We would like to emphasize the pedagogical character of this paper (at least we try) for this reason we
have abused of superﬂuous calculations and we have omitted some technical details since the supposed
audience are mainly engineers and/or physicists but not for mathematicians.

2 The method

In this section we will explain how the D.A. works in order to solve odes through two simple examples.
The main idea is to introduce dimensional constants that make the ode under study verify the principle
of dimensional homogeneity. These dimensional constants help us to ﬁnd c.v. which bring us to obtain
ode with separating variables. These c.v. obtained through D.A. correspond to invariant solution (or at
least to a particular solution) and therefore they are induced by one symmetry. We compare our tactic
with the Lie one.

Example 1 Solve the homogeneous equation

Solution.

In order to solve it we will use three diﬀerent ways, the traditional, the dimensional

and the Lie method.

as we will see later this solution is a particular solution of this ode. We would like to emphasize that as
we have only needed one constant then the equation is scale-invariant in such a way that the generator
of this group is X = x∂x + y∂y as it is observed from eq. (5). This fact will be probed studying this
equation under the Lie group tactic, see below.

than the original one.

t + C1 = 0,

and therefore we obtain again the solution (13). As we will see below all these c.v. are generated by
their corresponding (respective) symmetry.

As we can see, this last change of variables is better than the ﬁrst and the tactic is the same: to

introduce dimensional constants that make the equation dimensional homogeneous.

invariant, as in this case, the solution obtained applying by the Pi theorem coincides with the invariant
solution that generates the scale symmetry, in this case X3). We see that we only obtain a particular
solution, but that this is invariant, in fact if we think about the ode as a dynamical system we see that
the ﬁxed point of such equation would be precisely the solution y =

such solution, this solution usually is obtained by combining them in a very simple way.

With these two simple examples we have tried to show how the D.A. works in order to introduce
c.v. which brings us to obtain simpler odes than the original one. As we have emphasized in the recipe,
the trick is to look for a particular solution. Sometimes this particular solution will be furthermore
invariant solution (induced by a concrete symmetry). If this is the case, then our ode will be reduced
to an ode with separating variables but if this solution is only a particular then, as we will see below,
we have not any guarantee of reducing our ode to an ode with separate variables, nevertheless we will
obtain a simpler ode than the original one. In the next section we will study some examples.

3 Examples

In this section we will apply our pedestrian method to diﬀerent odes, beginning with a Bernoulli ode.
We go next to employ the method to solve Abel odes as well as Riccati odes since as anyone knows
these kind of odes are truly very diﬃcult.

Solution.

It is observed that introducing the following dimensional constants eq. (69) veriﬁes the

principle of dimensional homogeneity (p.d.h.),

where [a] = X 2Y. As we can see if we need only one constant then our equation is scale invariant and
therefore this constant indicates us that the generator of this symmetry is X =
2x∂x + y∂y as we will
see below. Therefore we have the following variables

−

t = x,

u(t) =

x = t,

y =

⇒

ln t + arctanh(u) + C1 = 0,

ln x + arctanh(

We would like to emphasize that in this case, as we have only one dimensional constant, we can ﬁnd
the particular solution y = ax−2 applying the Pi theorem, and that such solution (invariant particular
solution) is induced by the scale symmetry.

Eq. (69) equation has the following symmetries:

Introducing the following dimensional constants, we make that eq. (100) veriﬁes the

Once again we emphasize that the particular solution, y = Cx−1, (in this case invariant solution ,
see below) has been obtained from the relationship bxy

Alternatively we can try the following c.v. Writing the original Abel ode, eq.(100) in the following

Solution. Following our pedestrian method, we begin by introducing dimensional constants and

rewriting the odes as follows

In this section we will present two examples of odes that do not admit symmetries (Lie point symmetries).
Nevertheless in the ﬁrst of them D.A. helps us to obtain a simple c.v. that will bring us to obtain
a simpler ode (through a particular solution).
In the second case we will show that unfortunately
sometimes one ﬁnds odes that at this time have no solution, or at least we do not know how to solve

but in this case we have not found any solution, i.e. eq. (149) does not admit symmetries. Nevertheless,
one always may try to ﬁnd, as if by magic, any c.v. that brings to ﬁnd a simpler ode.

In this example we would like to show that there are some odes which are very intractable. Our
pedestrian method does not work in this case, we have not been able to ﬁnd any particular solution.
The Lie method does not work, i.e. this ode does not admit any symmetry and the theoretical methods
do not work either. At this time we do not know how to solve it.

where A and B are dimensional constant.

Solution.

In this occasion we already have the dimensional constants

[A] = x

−3y

−2,

[B] = y

−1x

−1,

in such a way that all the terms of the equation has dimensions of y
x . We check if one of the dimensional
relationship induces any particular solution ﬁnding that this is not the case. Therefore we go next
to look for any trivial combination between them but we are not able to ﬁnd any particular solution.
Nevertheless we try to obtain any result with the following c.v.:

t =

but unfortunately we have not advanced.
Another try is the following one:

t =

y =

(cid:19)

and hence:

′
tu2 + u

(1 + ut) = 0,

but as we supposed these attemps do not simplify our ode.

Now we change the strategy and we are going to suppose that the ode has dimension of y. In this
case we need to introduce the following dimensional constants in order to make eq. (158) verify the
p.d.h.

where [a] = x, [b] = y−2x−2 and [c] = y−1, which bring us to the following c.v.

To end, we would like to show that the theoretical method does not work either. For this purpose
we follow step by step the method beginning with a generic Abel ode of ﬁrst order written as follows:

′

y

= f3y3 + f2y2 + f1y + f0,

where in our case:

The c.v. suggested by the theoretical method is the following one

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

is the same than the suggested one by D.A. (165)). In this way our ode is now

(note that this c.v.
rewritten as:

where

′

u

u = h2u2 + h1u + h0,

h2 =

f1,

h1 =

h0 =

(173)

(174)

(175)

(176)

(177)

ﬁnding therefore that in our case we have:

′
u

u =

+ u + t2,

u2
t

which is an Abel of second order (this ode has no solution). To try to ﬁnd a solution of this ode we
make the following c.v.

obtaining this new ode:

(r = t,

s(r) = u(t)E) =

t = r,

u(t) =

s(r)
E

,

(cid:19)

⇒

(cid:18)

where

hence

E = exp(

h2), F1 = h1E, F0 = h0E2,

ss

but unfortunately we do not know how to solve this apparently simple ode.

As we have seen this ode seems very pathological since none of the followed tactics have helped us

to obtain any solution.

5 Conclusions and discussion.

We have seen how writing the odes in such a way that they verify the pdh i.e. introducing dimensional
constants, we can obtain in a trivial way c.v. that bring us to obtain simpler ode than the original and
therefore their integration is immediate. Furthermore, we have tried to show that these c.v. are not
obtained as if by magic but that they correspond to invariant solutions or to particular solutions and
therefore they are generated by the symmetries that admit the ode.

Nevertheless, the D.A. has strong limitations. For example D.A. is unable (at least at this time

we do not know how to do it) to solve the following simple linear ode

′

y

=

x3 +

+ 3

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

(178)

for this reason one must not put all his conﬁdence in this “tactic”. This is one of the greater incon-
venience that presents the proposed method. But as we have noticed in the introduction, we think
that our pedestrian method continues having validity at least when one is studying ode derived from
engineering problems or physical problems etc... where, as it is supposed, such odes must verify the pdh
in such a way that for example the ode y′ = x + 1, lacks of any sense (physical sense, since we cannot
add a number to a physical quantity).

Nevertheless, and in spite of the limitations that we have not avoided to show, we continued believing
in the kindness (goodness) of the method and that it can be applied to obtain solutions (at least
particular solutions and in concrete invariant solutions) to more complicated equations like the following

Hidden symmetry in Coulomb interaction is one of the mysterious problems of modern physics.
Additional conserved quantities associated with extra symmetry govern wide variety of physics
problems, from planetary motion till ﬁne and hyperﬁne structures of atomic spectra. In this paper
we present a simple derivation of hidden symmetry operator in relativistic quantum mechanics for
the Dirac equation in the Coulomb ﬁeld. We established that this operator may be reduced to
the one introduced by Johnson and Lippmann. It is worthwhile to notice that this operator was
discussed in literature very rarely and so is not known well among physicists and was omitted even
in the recent textbooks on relativistic quantum mechanics and/or quantum electrodynamics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

It is well known that the Coulomb problem has
additional dynamical symmetry in classical and non-
relativistic quantum mechanics. Classical orbits in the
Coulomb ﬁeld are closed due to this symmetry.
In
quantum mechanics this symmetry shows up in the
form of ”accidental” degeneracy of hydrogen atom spec-
trum. The nature of these phenomena was explained
by V.Fock1, V. Bargman2, W. Pauli3 and others many
years ago. The ”hidden” symmetry related applications
have been discussed in several textbooks4,5,6 as well. The
conserved quantity associated with this symmetry often
called the Laplace-Runge-Lentz (LRL) vector were dis-
cussed by many authors (see7,8, for instance).

Less information is published about this symmetry in
in particular, for
the relativistic quantum mechanics,
the Dirac equation.
It is known, that well known l-
degeneracy of hydrogen atom spectrum in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics, is removed in case of the Dirac equa-
tion (since LRL vector is no longer conserved in this
case). However the degeneracy is not lifted completely
even in this case. The two-fold degeneracy in total an-
gular momentum still remains and it contradicts with
existence of well known experimental result - the Lamb
shift. It is entirely possible that the Lamb shift is also a
consequence of the same symmetry and it was discussed
in this content in relatively recent papers9,10.

The generalization of LRL vector that involves spin
degrees of freedom (Dirac’s particle) is called Johnson-
Lippman (JL) operator. The aim of our paper is to de-
rive the JL operator for relativistic hydrogen atom in the
Dirac equation as easily as possible.

II. THE JOHNSON-LIPPMAN OPERATOR (A
SHORT HISTORY)

The analogue of LRL vector in the Dirac equation is
the Johnson-Lippmann (JL) operator which in 1950 was
published by these authors in the form of brief abstract11.
Because of importance and rarity of this problem, below

we display the full text of the above mentioned abstract
as it was presented then.

”J6. relativistic Kepler Problem, M.H. Johnson
and B.A. Lippman, Naval Research Laboratory - Besides
the usual integrals of motion, ~M and ~j (in Dirac’s nota-
tion) the relativistic equations for a charge in a Coulomb
ﬁeld admit

−1 − i

(mc2)

(1)

¯hc
e2

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

as another integral of motion. Since A and j anticom-
mute, the pairs with the same |j| are degenerate. Thus
the existence of A establishes the ”accidental” degener-
acy in relativistic Kepler problem just as the existence of
the axial vector establishes the degeneracy with respect
to l in the corresponding non-relativistic problem”.

It is all what is known about this operator in scientiﬁc
press and textbooks. More detailed consideration, in our
best knowledge, had not been published neither then nor
after. As far as textbooks concerned, we have found only
a brief remark in the form of a short footnote in B.V.
Berestetskii’s book12.

Therefore we think that the derivation of JL operator
and consideration its principal properties is worthy of
certain interest for students as well as for teachers of
universities.

The JL operator were generalized to arbitrary dimen-
sions in the recent paper13 and it was shown that this op-
erator can be used to construct relativistic supercharge
in for so-called Witten’s superalgebra. As far as com-
mutativity of JL operator with the Dirac Hamiltonian is
concerned, it was only mentioned that it can be proved
by ”rather tedious manipulations”.

We think that from pedagogic point of view it is im-
portant to show explicitly the simplest way to prove the
above statement. Below we construct this operator in
rather simple and very transparent and understandable
way.

III. DIRAC’S K-OPERATOR AND K-ODD
OPERATORS

It is well known that the Dirac’s operator

(2)

commutes with the Dirac Hamiltonian

H = ~α · ~p + βm −

p
equation (1) for JL operator the Dirac operator is
denoted by j.
In our approach we follow the simple
logic:

- If there is some symmetry that relates two signs of κ,
the corresponding symmetry operator must anticommute
with K.

- At the same time, naturally, this operator has to

commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian.

Thus the ﬁrst step will be constructing an operator(s),
that anticommute with K. In order to ﬁnd such an oper-
ator, let generalize the theorem, which was known earlier
for the Pauli equation. We reformulate it in the following
form.
Theorem: Let ~V be a vector with respect to the angular
momentum ~l, i.e.,

In the vector product form it can be written as

[li, Vj] = iεijkVk

~l × ~V + ~V × ~l = 2i~V

Suppose also that this vector is perpendicular to ~l

=

~l · ~V
(cid:16)
~Σ · ~V
Then K anticommutes with operator
scalar with respect to the total ~J momentum.
(cid:17)

~V · ~l
(cid:17)

= 0

(cid:16)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

, which is

Proof: Let us consider a product

. Ex-
ploiting the known properties of Dirac matrices and con-
(cid:17) (cid:16)
ditions of the theorem, one can establish that

In the last step we made use of the equation (6). There-
fore we have obtained

(cid:17) (cid:16)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

Now, according to the deﬁnition (2), it follows that

Thus the theorem is proved.

It is evident that the class of anticommuting with K
(so called, K -odd) operators is not restricted by these
operators only - any operator of kind ˆO
, where
ˆO is commuting with K, but otherwise arbitrary, also is
K -odd.

which follows from vector’s transformation rule men-
tioned in theorem in the form of vector product.

One can see that the antisymmetrized vector product
characteristic of LRL vector appears on the right-hand
side of this relation. Important special cases, resulting
from the above theorem include ~V = ˆ~r (unit radial vec-
tor), ~V = ~p (linear momentum) and ~V = ~A (LRL vector).
This last one has the following form3

~A = ˆ~r −

At this point we are tooled up to derive the hidden sym-
metry operator, which is done in the following section.

IV. THE HIDDEN SYMMETRY OPERATOR

and using this result in the ﬁrst equation, we obtain that

The second step of our two stage derivation strategy is
to ﬁnd K-odd operators that commutes with the Dirac
Hamiltonian. There remains still considerable freedom
of choice here because of above mentioned remark about
operators like ˆO
. One can take ˆO into consider-
ation or ignore it.
(cid:16)
(cid:17)
Let us choose

~Σ · ~V

~Σ · ˆ~r and K

~Σ · ~p
(cid:17)

(cid:16)

Because of speciﬁc place of LRL vector, it is reasonable
to assume that ~Σ · ~A - like term will present here. So
this choice is dictated by (11). Both operators in (12)
are diagonal matrices. After commuting them with non-
diagonal H we will eventually end up with non-diagonal
terms. For example,

~Σ · ˆ~r, H

(See, exercise 2 below). The resulting matrix on the
right-hand side is anti-diagonal. Probing the follow-

(cid:17)

Here the coeﬃcients are chosen in such a way, that A′
be Hermitian, with x1,2,3 are arbitrary real numbers and
f (r) is an arbitrary scalar function (to be determined
later).

The commutator of A′ with H is given by

This operator is a K -odd and satisﬁes all conditions of
the above theorem.

Thus we constructed the operator, which is associ-
ated with a hidden symmetry of the Dirac equation in
Coulomb ﬁeld. But this operator is not new. One can
make sure of that (20) is a diﬀerent form of JL operator.
Indeed, if we turn to usual ~α matrices making use of def-
inition (4) and taking into account the expression (3) for
the Dirac Hamiltonian, A′ can be reduced to the form
(x1, as unessential common factor, may be dropped)

This expression is nothing but the Johnson-Lippmann

V. PHYSICAL MEANING AND SOME
APPLICATIONS OF JL OPERATOR

In order to understand a physical meaning of A′ oper-
ator note that, using (9), equation (20) may be rewritten
in the following form:

(cid:18)

i(cid:19)

In the non-relativistic limit, when β → 1, and γ5 → 0,
this operator reduces to the projection of LRL vector on
the electron spin direction, A′ → ~Σ · ~A, or because of
~l · ~A
= 0, it is a projection on the total momentum, ~J.
As for further application, let us calculate the square
(cid:16)
(cid:17)
of JL operator. The result is as follows13:

A2 = 1 +

2

K
a

H 2
m2 − 1

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(22)

Because all operators in (22) commute with each other,
one can replace them by their eigenvalues. Therefore one
obtains energy spectrum pure algebraically after specify-
ing spectrum of A2. Since A2 is positively deﬁned the

minimal eigenvalue of A2 is zero. For this eigenvalue so-
lution of (22) gives precisely the ground state energy of
hydrogen atom,

Solution:

E0 = m

!

Full spectrum can be easily derived by well-known ladder
procedure13 . It leads to the usual Sommerfeld formula
(5).

It is worthwhile to note a full analogy with classical me-
chanics, where closed orbits were derived by calculating
the square of LRL vector without solving the diﬀerential
equation of motion4. Therefore we are convinced that
the degeneracy of hydrogen atom spectrum with respect
to interchange κ → −κ is related to the existence of JL
operator, which in its turn takes its physical origin from
the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector.

It is also remarkable that the same symmetry is re-
sponsible for absence of the Lamb shift in this problem.

found by calculating radiative corrections to the pho-
ton propagator and photon-electron vertex function, into
the Dirac Hamiltonian breaks commutativity of A with
H. However it is evident that without radiative correc-
tions, terms like (23) do not appear in the Dirac Hamil-
tonian, as in the one-electron theory, and as long as only
Coulomb potential is considered, the appearance of the
Lamb shift should be always forbidden.

In conclusion we want to underline once again that
the hidden symmetry, associated to the Coulomb po-
tential, governs a wide range of phenomena from plan-
etary motion till ﬁne and hyperﬁne structure of atomic
spectra. Therefore teaching of special aspects of this ex-
tremely unusual symmetry can extend the capabilities of
advanced students.

Finally we present some useful exercises that can help
students to master calculation of commutators, consid-
ered in the main text.

Making use of these exercises students will enhance
their knowledge in technical problems of manipulations
with Dirac matrices and calculations of some commuta-
tors.

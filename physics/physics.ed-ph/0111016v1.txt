A bar magnet, attached to an oscillating system, passes
through a coil periodically, generating a series of emf pulses.
A novel method is described for the quantitative veriﬁcation
of Faraday’s law which eliminates all errors associated with
angular measurements, thereby revealing delicate features of
the underlying mechanics. When electromagnetic damping is
activated by short-circuiting the coil, a distinctly linear decay
of oscillation amplitude is surprisingly observed. A quanti-
tative analysis reveals an interesting interplay of the electro-
magnetic and mechanical time scales.

I. INTRODUCTION

Laboratory experiments on Faraday’s law of electro-
magnetic induction most often involve a bar magnet mov-
ing (falling) through a coil, and studying the induced emf
pulse. [1–4] Several parameters can be varied, such as the
velocity of the magnet, the number of turns in the coil,
and the strength of the bar magnet. The observed pro-
portionality of the peak induced emf on the number of
turns in the coil and the magnet velocity provide a quan-
titative veriﬁcation of the Faraday’s law.

Commonly it is found convenient to attach the mag-
net to an oscillating system, so that it passes through the
coil periodically, generating a series of emf pulses. This
allows the peak emf to be easily determined by charg-
ing a capacitor with the rectiﬁed coil output. A simple,
yet remarkably robust setup which utilizes this concept
involves a rigid semi-circular frame of aluminum, piv-
oted at the center (O) of the circle (see Fig. 1). The
whole frame can oscillate freely in its own plane about
a horizontal axis passing through O. A rectangular bar
magnet is mounted at the center of the arc and the arc
passes through a coil C of suitable area of cross section.1
The positions of the weights W1 and W2 can be adjusted
to bring the mean position of the bar magnet vertically
below the pivot O, and the position of coil is adjusted so
that its center coincides with this mean position (θ = 0)
of the magnet. The angular amplitude can be read by
means of a scale and pointer. The magnet velocity can
be controlled by choosing diﬀerent angular amplitudes,

1In our experimental setup in the UG laboratory, the coil has
a diameter of about 10 cm, about the same length, consists
of several thousand turns of insulated copper wire, and has a
resistance of about 1000 Ω.

allowing the magnetic ﬂux to be changed at diﬀerent
rates.

It is much more instructive to monitor the induced
emf in the coil through a PC interface, which can be
readily realized by low-cost, convenient data-acquisition
modules available in the market. We have used a mod-
ule based on the serial interface “COBRA-3” and its ac-
companying software “Measure”, marketed and manufac-
tured by PHYWE. [5] We specially found useful the var-
ious features of “Measure” such as “integrate”, “slope”,
“extrema”, “zoom” etc. In this article we describe mod-
iﬁed experiments designed to take advantage of the com-
puter interface. This allows for a quantitative and peda-
gogical study of (i) angular (position) dependence of the
magnetic ﬂux through the coil, (ii) veriﬁcation of Fara-
day’s law of induction and (iii) electromagnetic damping,
thereby revealing delicate features of the underlying me-
chanics.

below for one quarter cycle of oscillation, starting from
the extreme position of the bar magnet (θ = θ0). As
the magnet approaches the coil, the induced emf initially
rises, then turns over and starts falling as the magnet

is seen to be signiﬁ-
cant only in a very narrow time-interval of about 200 ms,
which is much smaller than the oscillation time period
(T
2 s). This implies that the magnetic ﬂux through
the coil falls oﬀ very rapidly as the magnet moves away
from its center, so that dΦ/dθ is signiﬁcant only in a very
narrow angular range (typically about 5◦) on either side
of the mean position. As dΦ/dθ = 0 at θ = 0, it follows
that dΦ/dθ is strongly peaked quite close to the mean
position, which accounts for the emf pulse shape seen in
Fig. 2. This separation of the electromagnetic and me-
chanical time scales has interesting consquences on the
electromagnetic damping, as further discussed in section
IV.

III. MAGNETIC FLUX THROUGH THE COIL

In order to quantitatively study the magnetic ﬂux
through the coil, the “integrate” feature of the software
is especially convenient. From Eq. (1) the time-integral
of the induced emf directly yields the change in magnetic
ﬂux ∆Φ corresponding to the limits of integration.
If
the lower limit of integration ti corresponds to the ex-
treme position of the magnet (θ(ti) = θ0), [6] where the
magnetic ﬂux through the coil is negligible (valid only
for large θ0), the magnetic ﬂux Φ(θ) for diﬀerent angular
positions θ(t) of the magnet is obtained as

the magnetic ﬂux changes very rapidly as the magnet
crosses the center of the coil. As the angular velocity of
the magnet is nearly constant in the central region, the
time scale in Fig. 3 can be easily converted to the angular
(θ = ωt) or linear (x = Rθ) scale. The points of inﬂec-
tion, where dΦ/dt (and therefore dΦ/dθ) are extremum,
are at 4200 and 4300 ms, precisely where the peaks occur
in the emf pulse (Fig. 2).

net is very nearly constant in the narrow angular range

V. ELECTROMAGNETIC DAMPING

To study the nature of the electromagnetic damping
in the oscillating system, the coil was short-circuited
through a low resistance (220 Ω). The oscillations were
started with a large initial amplitude (still θ0/2 << 1),
and the voltage V (t) across the resistor was studied as a
function of time. As the oscillations decayed, the peak
voltages Vmax for sample pulses were recorded at roughly
equal intervals on the time axis. This voltage V (t) is pro-
portional to the current through the circuit, and hence to
the induced emf
max is approxi-
(t). As the peak emf
mately proportional to the oscillation amplitude (except
when the amplitude becomes too small), a plot of Vmax
vs. t actually exhibits the decay of the oscillation ampli-
tude with time.

Although an exponential decay of amplitude is more
commonly encountered in damped systems, the plot of
the normalized peak voltage Vmax(t)/Vmax(0) vs. t shows
a distinctly linear decay (Fig. 5). To distinguish the elec-
tromagnetic damping from other sources (friction, air re-
sistance etc.) the same experiment was repeated in the
open-circuit conﬁguration, in which case electromagnetic
damping is absent. In this case the amplitude decay is,
as expected, much weaker, but signiﬁcantly it is still ap-
proximately linear.

A quantitative analysis of the energy loss provides an
explanation for this nearly linear decay in both cases. We
ﬁrst consider the electromagnetic energy loss. Neglecting
radiation losses, the main source of energy loss is Joule
heating in the coil due to the induced current. Integrat-
ing over one cycle we have

delicate deviation was presumably washed out by the
large percentage errors in θ0 measurements, especially
for small angles, precisely where this deviation is more
pronounced.

An alternative approach, which eliminates the need for
measuring the oscillation amplitude θ0, is proposed be-
low. Taking the time derivative of the induced emf, and
setting θ = 0, where the angular velocity is maximum,
we obtain

As this relation holds for all amplitudes θ0, it may be used
to obtain ωmax for diﬀerent angular amplitudes without
the need for any angular measurement. The slope at

through linear interpolation (see Fig. 2). Thus, a plot

amplitudes not too small, the angular velocity dθ/dt is
nearly constant (

We now consider the energy loss in the open-circuit
case, where the damping is due to frictional losses. A
frictional force proportional to velocity, as due to air re-
sistance at low velocities, will result in an exponential
decay of the oscillation amplitude. However, a function
of the type e−αt did not provide a good ﬁt. On the
other hand, assuming a constant frictional torque τ at
the pivot, which is not unreasonable considering the con-
tact forces at the pivot, we obtain for the energy loss in
one cycle,

This is similar to the earlier result of Eq. (8) for electro-
magnetic damping, yielding a linear decay of the oscilla-
tion amplitude with time, which provides a much better
ﬁt with the observed data, as seen in Fig. 5. The devi-
ation from linearity at large times is presumably due to
a small air resistance term. In fact, if a damping term
k′E due to air resistance is included in Eq. (8), the dif-
−
ferential equation is easily solved, and the solution pro-
vides an excellent ﬁt to the data. Finally, another term

VI. SUMMARY

A pedagogically instructive study of electromagnetic
induction and damping is made possible by attaching a
PC interface to a conventional setup for studying Fara-
day’s law. By eliminating all errors associated with an-
gular measurements, the novel method applied for the
veriﬁcation of Faraday’s law reveals delicate features as-
sociated with the underlying mechanics. A quantitative
analysis of the distinctly linear decay of oscillation am-
plitude due to electromagnetic damping reveals an inter-
esting interplay of the electromagnetic and mechanical
time scales.

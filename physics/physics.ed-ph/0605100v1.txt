Reﬂection of light from a moving mirror:
derivation of the relativistic Doppler formula without Lorentz transformations

Malik Rakhmanov

A special case of the relativistic Doppler eﬀect, which occurs when light reﬂects from a moving
mirror, is discussed. The classic formula for the Doppler shift is derived in a fully non-relativistic
fashion using basic facts from geometry. The derivation does not involve Lorentz transformations,
length contractions and time dilations, and therefore is conceptually simpler than the standard
derivations in physics textbooks. This discussion can be useful for teaching introductory physics
and also for understanding the foundations of special relativity.

The Doppler eﬀect is commonly known as an appar-
ent change in frequency of a wave when the source of
the wave or the observer are moving with respect to each
other. Somewhat more complicated version of this ef-
fect appears in special relativity in the context of light
waves propagating in vacuum.
In this case, the usual
(nonrelativistic) Doppler contraction of the wavelength
of light becomes mixed with the Lorentz contraction. For
a source moving away from an observer with velocity u,
special relativity predicts

ω,

where ω is the frequency of the wave measured in the rest-
frame of the source, and ω′ is the frequency of the wave
measured in the rest-frame of an observer [1]. This equa-
tion is usually derived in physics textbooks with the help
of Lorentz transformations applied to the 4-dimensional
wavevector [2]. Sometimes, a derivation may not include
Lorentz transformations explicitly, but then it would rely
on relativistic time dilations [3]. Even more diﬃcult is
the derivation of the frequency change when the wave
reﬂects from a moving object (mirror). In this case, the
answer is usually obtained by performing two Lorentz
transformations: one from the laboratory frame to the
rest frame of the mirror and the other in reverse.

An alternative derivation can be obtained by noticing
that the mirror forms an image which moves away from
an observer. The observer then detects the reﬂected wave
as if it were coming from the image behind the mirror.
In classical physics, a mirror moving with velocity v cre-
ates an image moving with velocity u = 2v. In special
relativity, the image would be moving with velocity

which results from the law for relativistic velocity addi-
tion. Substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), we obtain the
formula for the frequency of the reﬂected light

u =

2v
1 + v2/c2 ,

′

ω.

Although this derivation seems simple enough, it still
uses relativistic concepts. Namely, Eq. (2) is usually de-
rived using Lorentz transformations.

It is interesting to note that the law for relativistic ve-
locity addition, of which Eq. (2) is a special case, can
be derived directly from the constancy of the speed of
light without any use of Lorentz transformations [4]. In
this paper we show that even the velocity addition for-
mula is not necessary and give an entirely non-relativistic
derivation of Eq. (3).

Consider an electromagnetic wave E(x, t) propagating
in the positive x-direction and assume that the wave is
incident upon a mirror which is moving along the trajec-
tory: x = s(t), as shown in Fig. 1. The mirror trajectory
can be arbitrary provided that the mirror velocity,

v(t) =

ds
dt

,

never exceeds the speed of light. The electric ﬁeld mea-
sured by the observer at time t must be the same as the
ﬁeld at the time of reﬂection τ , when it coincides with
input ﬁeld:

Eref(x, t) = Ein[s(τ ), τ ].

The time of reﬂection can be found from the ﬁgure:
τ = t − s(τ ) − x

.

c

This equation deﬁnes τ as an implicit function of x and
t, which means that in general we cannot solve for τ .
However, we can ﬁnd its derivatives with respect to t
and x:

(2)

For a plane-monochromatic wave with frequency ω, the

electric ﬁeld is given by

∂τ
∂t

=

.

Ein(x, t) = cos(ωt − kx),

where k is the wavenumber: k = ω/c. In this case, Eq. (5)
yields the reﬂected wave in the form:

(3)

Eref (x, t) = cos [ωτ − ks(τ )] .

The ﬁrst derivative in the right-hand side of this equa-
tion, ds/dτ , is nothing but the mirror velocity at the time
of reﬂection. The second derivative is given by Eq. (7).
We thus ﬁnd the frequency of the reﬂected wave as

′

ω

(x, t) =

c − v(τ )
c + v(τ )

ω,

which represents the relativistic Doppler eﬀect and is an

extension of Eq. (3) to non-uniform mirror motions.

A natural question which one can ask is: what happens
to the wavelength? The wavelength λ can be found from
the wavenumber, λ = 2π/k, whereas the wavenumber is
related to the frequency by

0

x

s(  )τ

ω = c k.

(16)

FIG. 1: Light ray and mirror trajectory in x − t space.

Here the dependence of the electric ﬁeld on x and t is
hidden in τ . A diﬀerent, but more familiar representation
for the electric ﬁeld can be found by substituting τ from
Eq. (6) into Eq. (9). The result can be written as

Eref (x, t) = cos [ωt + kx + φ(x, t)] .

(10)

However, it is not clear that this relationship applies to
the wave reﬂected by the moving mirror because ω is
no longer constant. Furthermore, k is not constant ei-
ther. In this situation, the wavenumber shall be deﬁned
as a rate at which the total phase of the wave changes in
space, provided that time is frozen:

′

k

(x, t) ≡ ∂
∂x

[ωt + kx + φ(x, t)]

= k +

∂φ
∂x

.

The phase shift φ(x, t) depends on the mirror position at
the time of reﬂection:

Expanding ∂φ/∂x as in Eq. (14), we obtain

φ(x, t) = −2ks(τ ).

(11)

Once the wave is reﬂected by a moving mirror its fre-
quency is no longer constant; it depends on the position
of the observer and the time of the measurement. The
instantaneous frequency of the reﬂected light is deﬁned
as a rate at which the total phase of the wave changes in
time at a given point:

′

ω

(x, t) ≡ ∂
∂t

[ωt + kx + φ(x, t)]

= ω +

∂φ
∂t

.

(12)

(13)

Thus, the frequency of the reﬂected wave is shifted with
respect to the frequency of the incident wave by ∂φ/∂t.
This partial derivative can be found using the chain rule:

′

k

(x, t) =

c − v(τ )
c + v(τ )

k,

which explicitly proves that

′

ω

(x, t) = c k

(x, t).

Thus, the standard dispersion relation for electromag-
netic waves in vacuum remains the same even if the waves
are reﬂected from a mirror moving along an arbitrary tra-
jectory.

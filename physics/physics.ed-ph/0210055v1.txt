Elementary Thermodynamics of Trapped Particles

Martin Ligare∗
Department of Physics, Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA 17837

I develop simple thermodynamic relations for a collection of noninteracting classical particles
conﬁned in a harmonic trap. The volume of such a trap is not a good thermodynamic variable, so
conventional expressions of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics and the ideal gas law must be modiﬁed.
I use the frequency of oscillations about the minimum of the trap as an external parameter char-
acterizing the conﬁnement, and derive elementary relations between particle number, temperature,
energy, oscillation frequency, and a generalized pressure, that are analogous to conventional ther-
modynamic relations for an ideal gas in a rigid volume. I also discuss heat capacities for trapped
particles.

INTRODUCTION

The derivation of the ideal gas law is covered in es-
sentially every modern text on thermodynamics and sta-
tistical mechanics. This law applies to non-interacting
classical particles in a rigid container, and expresses the
familiar relationship

P V = N kT

(1)

between the pressure P , volume V , number of particles
N , and the temperature T ; k is the Boltzmann constant.
It is also shown that the energy of of an ideal gas is given
by

E =

N kT.

Recent experiments on cooled neutral atoms (which have
ultimately led to observations of Bose-Einstein conden-
sation) have been performed in atom traps which in
the ideal case have conﬁning potentials of inﬁnite range.
Thus volume is not an appropriate thermodynamic vari-
able. It is instructive to consider how the familiar ele-
mentary relations of Eqs. (1) and (2) must be modiﬁed
in these circumstances.

In this paper I consider atoms in isotropic harmonic
conﬁning potentials. For particles of mass m and en-
ergy E conﬁned by a one-dimensional harmonic poten-
tial with angular oscillation frequency ω, the amplitude
2E/(mω2). This suggests using the fre-
of oscillation is
quency of oscillation about the minimum of the trap as
the externally determined parameter characterizing the
conﬁnement of the particles in the trap, and in this note
I consider the development of thermodynamic relations
which involve ω rather than the volume V .

I follow the approach used in several modern texts to
derive the ideal gas law (see, for example, [1, 2, 3, 4]).
The canonical ensemble partition function is derived in a
semi-classical manner, i.e., using information about the

∗mligare@bucknell.edu

spacing and degeneracy of quantized energy levels, and
the partition function is then used in combination with
the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics to derive relationships
between the thermodynamic variables.

II. FUNDAMENTAL EQUATIONS

The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is an articulation of
the work-energy theorem. For a gas in a volume V this
is expressed as

∆E = ∆Q − P ∆V.

(2)

Although the volume isn’t a relevant parameter for par-
ticles in a trap, the conﬁning potential can do work on
the particles when it is altered. We can express this idea
in a modiﬁcation of the ﬁrst the ﬁrst law,

∆E = ∆Q + P∆ω,

in which P is a “pressure” for which I will derive an
expression below. (I use the term “pressure” loosely; this
quantity does not have the dimensions of force per unit
area.) Note that I have chosen the sign of the second
term on the right side of Eq. (4 to be positive, reﬂecting
the fact that an increase in ω corresponds to an increase
in the strength of the conﬁnement, which increases the
density of the particles and eﬀectively compresses them.
The conventional arguments leading to the deﬁnition

of the Helmholtz free energy

F = E − T S

are not aﬀected by the change from conﬁnement in a
rigid volume to conﬁnement in a trap. Combining the
modiﬁed ﬁrst law with the deﬁnition of free energy leads
to the relationship

which implies

dF = −S dT + P dω,

The energy of the particles is

(8)

The relationship between the Helmholtz free energy
and the partition function is based on general arguments
regarding entropy, so that for particles in a trap it is still
true that

F (T, ω, N ) = −kT ln Z(T, ω, N ).

which combined with Eqs. (13) shows that

The linear relationship between energy and oscillation
frequency is to be expected given the fact that energy of
each quantized single-particle energy level is of the form
m¯hω (where m is an integer).

This makes sense because the translational motion of
each particle contributes 3k/2 to the heat capacity, and
the potential energy of the three-dimensional harmonic
oscillator conﬁning potential contributes an additional
3k/2. The diﬀerence between the heat capacities at con-
stant ω and at constant P is

CP − Cω = −P

This means that

In other words, the energy needed to raise the tempera-
ture of the particles by ∆T all comes from the work done
on the particles by the increase in ω that is necessary to
keep P = E/ω constant.

which gives the analog to the ideal gas law for the trapped
particles:

variable. Thermodynamics can, however, be developed
using other parameters characterizing the conﬁnement of
the particles. In this paper I have considered particles in
isotropic harmonic traps, and I have used the frequency
of oscillations about the minimum of the trap as the con-
ﬁnement parameter analogous to V . I have derived the
analog to the ideal gas law for this simple case, and also

formulas for appropriate heat capacities. These simple
relations can be used to solve many thermodynamic prob-
lems for trapped particles that are analogous to problems
for gases in containers with rigid walls that are posed in
introductory texts. Generalizations to anisotropic traps
and more complicated potentials are certainly possible,
and would make good student projects.

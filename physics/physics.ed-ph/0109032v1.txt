Schr¨odinger wave

January 19, 2014

A trajectory of a harmonic oscillator obeying the Schr¨odinger wave equation is
exactly derived and illustrated. The trajectory resembles well the classical orbit be-
tween the turning points, and also runs through the tunneling region. The dynamics
of the ‘particle’ motion and the wave function associated with the motion are pro-
posed. The period of a round trip on the trajectory is exactly equal to that obtained
in classical mechanics.

1 Introduction

In general the motion of a particle whose beam shows an interference phenomenon is de-
scribed by the wave equation. On the other hand the orbit of the particle described in
classical mechanics plays an important role in the ﬁelds such as electron optics, particle
accelerators, radiation from electron beams and so forth. The signiﬁcance of the scattering
wave function, wave-optical approach, was clariﬁed by comparison with the classical wave
function, ray-optical approach, by Gordon. [1]

Geometrical optics describes the movement of the light corpuscle in the space as the ray
of light. Formulas for the ray of light derive from the eikonal equation. This corresponds
to the Hamilton characteristic function for the particle motion, [2] which can be derived
from the Schr¨odinger wave function in the WKB approximation for the system with the
stationary potential.

The concept of the orbit or the ray of light in the wave phenomena gives a comprehensive
image and physical insight of the process, although it has been an approximate idea. [3, 4, 5]
The ﬁeld ion microscope and scanning tunneling microscope are now available to image an
atomic movement on solid surfaces. [6, 7] An atom can be picked up and moved to an
arbitrary place. [8] These suggest the possibility of the precise description of the motion of
the particle even in the atomic scale.

A proposal of extension of the light ray to the shadow region had been made in order to
clarify the physics of the diﬀraction. [9] The relation between the wave and the light ray or
orbit should be investigated more carefully. Trajectory in the optical wave, extension of a
ray of light, was developed by generalizing the eikonal to the mode characteristic function
with dynamical assumptions. [11]

If the motion of the particle is restricted to that in the classical region where classical
mechanics is the case, the orbital motion is derived from the Hamilton characteristic func-
tion by the Hamilton-Jacobi theory for the system with the stationary potential. [12] If the
characteristic function could be generalized to that valid for every space region, it would
be able to pinpoint the motion of the particle even in the tunneling region. [13]

Along the similar way of thinking, Bohm proposed a quantum theory with “hidden
variables” to suggest objective description of individual systems at a quantum level of
accuracy. [14] It has made a general scheme of the causal interpretation but not given a
concrete trajectory with the dynamical behavior of a ‘particle’ in the space-time region from
the wave equation. The goal of every causal theory or interpretation as to the quantum
mechanics is a complete description of an individual real situation as it exists independently
of acts of observation. [15] The motivation is summarized in the Einstein’s feeling that the
statistical prediction of the quantum theory is correct but by supplying the missing elements,
it could be in principle got beyond statistics to a determinate theory. [16] To fulﬁl the aim
it might be necessary to exploit the suitable mathematical tools to describe the particle
motion in quantum mechanics.

In the present paper, a trajectory of the harmonic oscillator in one and two dimension
is exactly derived from the Schr¨odinger wave function. The trajectory and dynamical
motion are compared with the classical orbit and dynamical behavior in the classical region.
The relation between the traveling waves associated with the ‘particle’ motion and usual
stationary wave function is discussed.

2 Dynamics and wave function

The way to derive the trajectory from the wave equation is described and the signiﬁcance of
the wave function is discussed. The Schr¨odinger wave equation for a particle in a stationary
potential, V , in one spatial dimension, is

∂2
∂x2 + V
The equation is separable in t and x. A wave function for a ‘stationary’ state is written as

∂

HΨ.

Ψ(x, t) = exp(

iEt/¯h)Φ(x, E),

(2)

−
where E is a constant of separation. Function Φ is a general solution of an ordinary diﬀer-
ential equation of second order. The boundary condition that the function be bounded and
continuous everywhere in the domain deﬁned is not imposed on the function yet. Function
Φ is the ‘eigenfunction’ of the Hamiltonian operator H. Constant E is the ‘eigenvalue’ and
the energy of the ‘stationary’ state. The wave function Ψ determines the ‘eigenstate’, or
the ‘mode’, speciﬁed by E. The constant E should be called the mode parameter.

2

If the parameter takes speciﬁc, discrete, values, the wave function satisﬁes the boundary
condition. The state with a speciﬁc parameter is usually called a stationary state or the
mode, and function Φ is the eigenfunction. For the present, the parameter is assumed to
be a real number and the words, such as stationary, eigen, mode and particle are used with
quotation marks.

The wave function of the form of

is sought, where functions ρ and W are real number. Function W satisﬁes approximately

in the WKB approximation. The region where this equation holds should be called the
classical region. This is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with energy E. [12] If the solution
for ¯hW of this equation is written as Wcl, the Hamilton characteristic function is given
by [12]

Wcl(x, E) =

Function W satisﬁes the nonlinear equation (4) in the reference of Bohm [14], expressed in
the form S =

potential. Function W is assumed to satisfy the condition that in the classical region of x

except an additional constant independent of x and the mode parameter. If function W
can be determined uniquely, function W should be named the mode characteristic function
(mcf) for the system. The mcf W (x) is derived from the wave function Φ(x) as follows.
Since the wave equation is the ordinary diﬀerential equation of 2nd order, the function Φ
is composed of two linearly independent solutions, say u1 and u2,

Φ(x, E) = a u1(x, E) + b u2(x, E),

where a and b are complex constants. Constants a and b should be determined by the
following assumptions from the theoretical point of view.

Assumption 1: Function ¯hW in the classical region must be as approximate to the

corresponding characteristic function Wcl as possible in the sense of relation (6).

Assumption 2: The results derived from the equations of motion for W deﬁned by Eq.

(8) should be as approximate to the ones in classical mechanics as possible.

Function W (x) should be determined as the phase or argument of function Φ like Eq.(3).
The function Ψ consisting of this Φ may be said to represent the traveling wave associated
with the motion of a ‘particle’ in the ‘mode’ E.

The equation of motion for the ‘particle’ is assumed

Dynamical time t should be determined so as to increase monotonically as the ‘particle’

moves. From equation (8), a phase velocity

for x
for a turning point or an endpoint of the potential. After reaching xb, the ‘particle’ returns
to x0 with the mcf of
W (x, E) + 2W (xb, E), which guarantees the monotone increase of
time t given by equation (8).

The wave function associated with the ‘particle’ motion in a bound state should be
described as follows. If the function Φ (3) represents the motion of the ‘particle’ traveling
to the right, function Φ∗ = √ρ exp[
i W ], which is also the solution of the wave equation,
stands for the motion to the reverse direction. Let the endpoints of the potential in the x
coordinate be a and b. Then the ‘particle’ moves in the region a
b. Let it start from
a point x0 to the positive x direction and the mcf be W (x). The traveling wave associated
W (x, E) +

periodic one with period of 2π/ω1 or 2π/ω2, respectively. If the ratio ω1/ω2 is irrational,
the trajectory in the two dimensional space is not closed as is the case in classical mechanics.
An example of the trajectory for the system with parameters E1 = 3/2¯hω1 and E2 = 2¯hω2
and ω1/ω2 = 0.8 is shown in Fig. 3. The oscillator is set to start from the origin at t = 0,
or t0 = t2 = 0. In the ﬁgure the corresponding classical orbit with the same parameters is
also drawn. It could be seen that the bigger the values of the parameters, the closer the
trajectory and the classical orbit with each other, which shows the correspondence principle.

6 Conclusion

By generalizing the argument on optical wave,[11] the dynamics that should ﬁgure out a ray
of ‘particle’, a trajectory, in a ‘mode’ of the Schr¨odinger wave equation of the completely
separable form, especially in one spatial dimension, has been proposed. The dynamics
should be determined by the mcf and dynamical assumptions on it. The trajectory thus

line).

determined resembles well the orbit of the corresponding state in classical mechanics in the
classical region. It runs also through a tunneling region. This is veriﬁed for the harmonic
oscillator system. The period of a ‘particle’ in the oscillator is exactly equal to that in
classical mechanics.

The wave function bounded everywhere but not always continuous for any bound state
could be made by superposing the traveling waves associated with the ‘particle’ motion.
The eigenfunction of the stationary state should be interpreted to be the wave function of
the resonating state in the potential of the system. It is to be noted that all solutions of the
wave equation are necessary in order to derive the mcf to get the trajectory. This suggests
the role of all the solutions of the wave equation. Since the trajectory is determined by
the phase or argument of the traveling wave function, it does not always show all the path
of the energy transfer, which might be necessary for the real particle motion in the wave
equation.

The accordance of these characteristics between classical and quantum mechanics sug-
gests the validity of the dynamics deﬁned here. The main diﬀerence from the Bohm’s
theory [14] stems from the dynamical assumption (8). The signiﬁcance and the consistency
with the quantum theory should be veriﬁed for a more important system such as the one
with the Coulomb potential. By treating the scattering problem, the statistical but an in
principle determinate nature in quantum theory will be shown on getting the cross section.
It suggests the consistent existence of the trajectory in wave mechanics and the
signiﬁcance of the relation between the particle motion and the wave function, although
there may remain a lot to be considered about the observation process of particle and wave
phenomena.

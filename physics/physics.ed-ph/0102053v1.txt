Abstract

We solve the continuous one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation for the case

of an inverted nonlinear delta–function potential located at the origin, ob-

taining the bound state in closed form as a function of the nonlinear expo-

nent. The bound state probability proﬁle decays exponentially away from

the origin, with a proﬁle width that increases monotonically with the non-

linear exponent, becoming an almost completely extended state when this

approaches two. At an exponent value of two, the bound state suﬀers a

discontinuous change to a delta–like proﬁle. Further increase of the expo-

nent increases again the width of the probability proﬁle, although the bound

state is proven to be stable only for exponents below two. The transmission

of plane waves across the nonlinear delta potential increases monotonically

with the nonlinearity exponent and is insensitive to the sign of its opacity.

The delta-function potential δ(x

x0) has become a familiar sight in the

−

landscape of most elementary courses on quantum mechanics, where it serves

to illustrate the basic techniques in simple form. As a physical model, it has

been used to represent a localized potential whose energy scale is greater than

any other in the problem at hand and whose spatial extension is smaller

than other relevant length scales of the problem. Arrays of delta-function

potentials have been used to illustrate Bloch’s theorem in solid state physics

and also in optics, where in the scalar approximation, wave propagation in a

periodic medium resembles the dynamics of an electron in a crystal lattice. It

is well known that the single “inverted” delta-function potential

Ω δ(x

−

x0)

−

possesses one exponentially localized bound state for all values of the opacity

parameter Ω. Its existence and stability has been tested against the eﬀects

of diﬀerent boundary conditions1 and symmetry-breaking perturbations2. In

addition, the inverted delta potential has been used as a semi-permeable

barrier to examine resonance phenomena in scattering theory3, among others.

Other interesting applications of the delta-function potential concept are

In this work we examine the problem of ﬁnding the bound state and the

transmission coeﬃcient of plane waves across an inverted nonlinear delta–

function potential, described by the so-called Nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS)

space is determined by the localization length 2/Ω which increases (decreases)

as the opacity decreases (increases).

It might seem odd at ﬁrst to see a nonlinear–looking Schr¨odinger equation like

(1), since we know that quantum mechanics is linear. Therefore, all physical

systems should be described by coupled sets of linear equations. However

we oftentimes can only concentrate on a few “relevant” degrees of freedom,

making suitable approximations to deal with the rest. At times, the price to

pay for this reduction is the appearance of nonlinear evolution equations for

the variables of interest, such as Eq. (1).

For instance, in atomic physics, a well-known approximation when dealing

with multi-electron atoms is the self-consistent ﬁeld approximation (Hartree-

Fock). In this case each electron is described by a single-particle wave func-

tion that solves a Schr¨odinger-like equation. The potential appearing in this

equation is that generated by the average motion of all the other electrons,

and so depends on their single-particle wave functions. This results in a set of

nonlinear eigenvalue equations5. A more recent application of the mean-ﬁeld

ideas to a weakly interacting Bose condensate can be found in Ref.[6].

For α = 2, Eq.(1) could model the problem of an electron propagating in a

one–dimensional linear medium which contains a vibrational “impurity” at

the origin that can couple strongly to the electron. In the approximation,

where one considers the vibrations completely “enslaved” to the electron, one

4

obtains Eq.(1) as the eﬀective equation for the electron.

A closely related equation, given by the discrete version of (1) is known as

the discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger (DNLS) equation. It was introduced in

its time–independent form, in the late ﬁfties by Holstein in his studies of

the polaron problem7 in condensed matter physics. The DNLS equation

was derived in a fully time–dependent form by Davydov in his studies of

energy transfer in proteins and other biological materials8. In the continuum

limit the time-dependent DNLS equation reduces to the time-dependent NLS

equation, which supports soliton solutions. Therefore, a soliton–based energy

transport appears as an attractive candidate mechanism for energy transport

in biomolecules. A recent review of the status of Davydov’s proposal can be

found in Ref.[9]. The time-dependent DNLS equation can also be viewed

as the evolution equation for a Hamiltonian system of classical anharmonic

oscillators10.

An important application of the continuous model (1) is that of a wave

propagating in a one–dimensional linear medium which contains a narrow

strip of nonlinear (general Kerr-type) material11. This nonlinear strip is as-

sumed to be much smaller than the typical wavelength. In fact, periodic and

quasiperiodic arrays of nonlinear strips have been considered by a straight-

forward generalization of Eq.(1) in order to model wave propagation in some

nonlinear superlattices12.

Bound State (E = E(b) < 0): Our system consists of a single, inﬁnitely

localized potential well in a continuous inﬁnite line and therefore, lacks any

natural length scale. If the delta potential were conﬁned between two inﬁnite

5

walls, the distance between the walls would provide a length scale. If, instead

of a continuous line, the potential were deﬁned on a discrete lattice, its lattice

constant would deﬁne a natural length scale. Also, if instead of one delta

potential, we had at least two of them, their mutual distance would constitute

a natural length scale for the system.

In our case we have none of these. Thus, Ω serves only to deﬁne the unit of

distance (as it does in the linear case). It is possible to get rid of Ω formally

as follows: From Eq.(1) we see that Ω must have units of [distance](α/2)−1,

which suggests the deﬁnition of a dimensionless distance u as u = x/L, with

Ω2/(α−2). In terms of u and φ(u)

(1/√L) φ(x), Eq.(1) can be recast

As in the linear (α = 0) case, the bound state proﬁle is exponentially de-

creasing away from the delta potential with localization length 22/(2−α). As

α increases from zero, the probability proﬁle widens and the bound state

energy decreases in magnitude. At α = 2−, the state is completely extended

all over the real axis and the bound state energy is vanishingly small. At

α = 2+, the bound state becomes inﬁnitely localized, with a delta–like prob-

ability proﬁle and with an inﬁnite bound state energy. Further increase in

the nonlinear exponent leads to a widening of the probability proﬁle and to

a corresponding reduction in the magnitude of the bound state energy.

Figure 1 shows the amplitude, or the inverse square probability proﬁle width,

of the bound state as a function of the nonlinearity exponent. However, at

this point, an important observation is in order. The total energy of the

system does not coincide with the bound state energy. In order to see this, we

must consider the full time-dependent nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation that

gives rise to Eq. (2). By using τ

t/T as a dimensionless time variable,

with T

In other words, we have i(d/dτ ) ψ(u, τ ) = H ψ(u, τ ), where the Hamiltonian

operator can be decomposed as H = H0 + ON L, where H0 = p2, with p =

Thus, for α < 2 the total energy is negative and the eigenstate is a stable

localized state. On the contrary, when α > 2, the total energy is positive and

the eigenstate is localized but possibly unstable, which means that any weak

‘perturbation’ could make it disappear into the continuum. This explains the

‘stable’ and ‘unstable’ labelling in Fig.1. Only for α = 0, i.e., the linear case,

both the total energy and the energy eigenvalue coincide. Figure 2 shows

some probability proﬁles for several diﬀerent values of the nonlinear exponent

that give rise to true (stable) bound states. This distinction between the

eigenenergy and the total energy must always be kept in mind when dealing

with eﬀectively nonlinear systems.

where k2 = 2mE/¯h2 is the electron wavevector. Unlike the bound state

problem, we now have 1/k as a natural length scale and can therefore con-

sider Ω as a bona ﬁde opacity coeﬃcient. The problem looks similar to the

usual single delta-barrier problem, with the exception of the nonlinear term

For arbitrary α, Eq. (21) is a nonlinear equation for t and must be solved

numerically. There are, however, four exactly solvable cases, three of which

can be described shortly:

The case α = 3 is exactly solvable in principle, but it leads to a cumbersome

expression for t that is not particularly illuminating.

If we recast the general equation for t as t (1 + (Ω∗/2k)2 tα) = 1, a bit

of simple analysis will convince the reader that the left hand side is always a

monotonically increasing function of t for α > 0. Therefore, there is always

only one solution in the interval 0

t

1. Figure 3 shows the transmission

α. Unlike the bound state calculation, there is no restriction here on the

magnitude of the nonlinear exponent α. For all wavevectors, the transmission

increases with increasing α and does not display any special behavior at

α = 2. The increase of t with α can be easily understood with the help of

Eq.(21): For any α > 0, tα < 1 since t is less than unity. Thus, Ω∗ tα < Ω∗

which means that the total “nonlinear” opacity is always smaller than the

“linear” one, hence a higher transmission.

Summary.

In this work we have calculated the bound state correspond-

ing to a single “inverted” nonlinear delta-function potential, with opacity Ω

and nonlinearity exponent α. Following the usual methods of elementary

quantum mechanics, we arrived at a closed form expression for the bound

state characterized by an exponentially–decreasing probability proﬁle, with

11

a localization length that decreases with increasing α. The most signiﬁcant

feature of this solution is the existence of a critical α value, namely 2, beyond

which the total energy (not the eigenenergy) of the bound state becomes pos-

itive, making the state unstable against a collapse into the continuum. The

transmission of plane waves across the nonlinear delta potential is invariant

under a sign change in opacity, and increases monotonically with an increas-

ing nonlinearity exponent. The transmission is always higher than in the

linear case, for a nonzero exponent.

Finally, it is important to remark that because of the nonlinear nature of

Eqs. (1) and (6), it is no longer possible to superpose stationary states in

order to ﬁnd the time evolution of a given initial state. A stationary state

solution of Eq.(6) is now only a particular solution whose relation to the

solution of the time-dependent problem is unclear. Other features that arise

in similar ‘nonlinear’ quantum mechanical problems include the fact that

eigenstates are no longer guaranteed to be orthogonal to each other. Also,

the number of eigenstates is no longer constant, but depends on nonlinearity.

Thus, ‘nonlinear’ quantum mechanics is considerably more challenging than

the linear one, although the reader should be aware that, as was mentioned

at the beginning of this Note, nonlinearity in quantum mechanics is the

consequence of some underlying assumption about the system.

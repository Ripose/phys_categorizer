We discuss the boundary eﬀects on a quantum system by examining the problem of a hydrogen
atom in a spherical well. By using an approximation method which is linear in energy we calculate
the boundary corrections to the ground-state energy and wave function. We obtain the asymptotic
dependence of the ground-state energy on the radius of the well.

The wave function Ψ(r) satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion for the hydrogen atom for r < S, in particular it
should still be regular at the origin. The only diﬀerence
from the free-space case is that now we have to impose a
diﬀerent boundary condition: the wave function should
vanish at r = S instead of at r =

The hydrogen atom occupies a unique place in atomic
physics because it is the only atom for which the
Schr¨odinger equation can be solved analytically. The cal-
culation of the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom is
a standard exercise in a physicist’s education and is dis-
cussed in detail in many textbooks on quantum physics.
[1–3] Textbook discussions normally consider a hydrogen
atom in free space, with vanishing eigenfunction at inﬁn-
ity as one of the boundary conditions. Experiments in
atomic physics, of course, are normally done by position-
ing the atoms in a well-controlled cavity. One could then
ask what eﬀects does the presence of the ﬁnite boundary
have on the wave functions and the energy levels of the
atoms. A typical answer that one may get is that for com-
mon cavities used in actual experiments which are much
larger than the characteristic atomic distance, the Bohr
radius a0, the boundary gives rise only to an “exponen-
tially small” correction because the eigenfunctions of the
atom decay exponentially with distance. One, however,
rarely gets a more quantitative answer than this and it is
therefore an interesting challenge to obtain such an an-
swer. Moreover, modern technology has opened the pos-
sibility of constructing interesting structures in atomic
and molecular scales for which the question of boundary
eﬀects has become more than mere academic.

In this paper we will examine the boundary corrections
for a hydrogen atom situated at the center of a spherical
cavity of radius S as shown in Fig.1. We will assume the
wall of the cavity to be impenetrable and consider the
following spherically-symmetric potential:

V (r) =

e2/r,

(cid:26)

r < S,
r > S.

The radius of the cavity will be assumed to be much
larger than the Bohr radius: S
a0. In the remainder
of the paper we shall use the atomic units:

¯h =

The unit of length is the Bohr radius a0 = ¯h2/me2 and
the unit of energy is the Rydberg: Ry = e2/2a0 = 13.6
eV. The Schr¨odinger equation takes the following form:

For S

a0, the changes in the ground-state wave func-
tion and energy due to the presence of the wall are ex-
pected to be “small” because the wave function is concen-
trated at the center of the cavity, far away from the con-
ﬁning wall. Standard perturbation technique, however,
is not useful in this case because the inﬁnite potential
at the wall prevents the calculation of the required ma-
trix elements. The Rayleigh-Ritz variational method is
one viable alternative, but it is not clear how one should
choose the best set of variational functions to be used.
Furthermore, it cannot conveniently be used to calculate
the corresponding corrections for the excited states.

In the following we shall use an approximation method
which is linear in energy to calculate these corrections.
This is a well-known method in solid-state physics and
has been widely used in electronic structure calculations
since its initial introduction by O. K. Andersen in 1975.
[4,5] The method is best applied to the calculations of the
wave functions of a hamiltonian with energies which are
in close vicinity of the energy of a known wave function.
The present problem of a hydrogen atom in a spheri-

1

cal well can be used to illustrate the application of this
method. In the absence of the conﬁning cavity, the hy-
drogen atom has a well-known spectrum:

r R

n2 , n = 1, 2, . . . .
In the presence of the cavity, we write

εn =

−

En = εn + ∆εn.

We use small letters (ε, ψ, etc.) to denote quantities for
the free-space problem and capital letters (E, Ψ, etc.)
for the corresponding quantities in the cavity problem.
The dimensionless parameter (∆εn/εn) is expected to be
small for n2a0
S. In the linear method, the (unnor-
malized) wave function at energy En is approximated by

≪

Ψ(En, r) = ψ(εn, r) + ∆εn ˙ψ(εn, r).

(6)

Here ˙ψ(εn, r) is the derivative with respect to energy of
ψ(ε, r) evaluated at ε = εn:

˙ψ(εn, r) = [∂ψ(ε, r)/∂ε] (ε = εn).

The eigenfunctions in the cavity problem are then ob-
tained by imposing the boundary condition at r = S:

which gives an expression for the energy correction:

Ψ(En, S, ˆr) = 0,

∆εn =

ψ(εn, S, ˆr)
˙ψ(εn, S, ˆr)

.

−

Here ˆr = (θ, φ) is a unit vector in the direction of r.

To apply this simple approximate method we need the
general solution to the Schr¨odinger equation at an arbi-
trary energy E. Since we are dealing with a spherically-
symmetric system, we can separate the variables:

Ψ(r) = R(r)Ylm(ˆr).

with n a positive integer. This directly leads to the Ryd-

The function Rl(ω, r) is plotted in Fig.2 for l = 0 and ω
= 1, 0.98, and 0.50. The ω = 1 curve is the ground-state
wave function of the hydrogen atom in free space and is
nodeless. As ω is reduced below 1, the wave function ac-
to r = 2a0
quires a single node which moves from r =
at ω = 0.50. where it becomes the (n, l) = (2, 0) eigen-
state of the hydrogen atom in free space. One therefore
can obtain the ground-state wave function and energy of
the hydrogen atom in a cavity of radius S by numerically
searching for the energy which gives a wave function with
a single node at r = S. This provides a useful comparison
for our approximation.

Substituting the radial function Rl(ω, r) in Eq.(16) into
Eq.(18) then gives us an explicit formal expression for
n2a0. Note that
∆εn which should be valid for R
the presence of the ﬁnite boundary lifts the azimuthal
degeneracy of the states with diﬀerent orbital quantum
number l (and the same radial quantum number n). As
in the case of the screened Coulomb potential, this oc-
curs because one no longer deal with the pure Coulomb
potential.
In group theoretical language, modiﬁcations
to the pure Coulomb potential break the SO(4) symme-
try of the hydrogen atom: the Runge-Lenz operator no
longer commute with the hamiltonian. [7] This should be
contrasted with the classical case where the Runge-Lenz
vector is still a good constant of motion and the presence
of the boundary does not have any eﬀect on the orbit of
the particle if it is greater than the orbit’s aphelion.

To gain an insight into Eqs.(18)-(19), we shall consider
the ground state (n = 1), which is a special case of the
zero angular momentum (l = 0) states. We have

Fig.3 displays this asymptotic dependence of the energy
correction on the radius of cavity, together with the exact
curve and the one obtained from Eq.(18) using the exact
wave function Eq.(21).
It is seen that the asymptotic
formula, Eq.(31), is fairly accurate for radii greater than
about four Bohr radius. Note that the exact energy at
S = 2a0 is equal to 1
4 Ry, which is the energy of the ﬁrst
excited state (n, l) = (2, 0) of the hydrogen atom in free
space. This is because the corresponding wave function
has a node at r = 2a0 as can be seen in Fig.2.

Knowing the dependence of the ground-state energy
on the cavity radius, Eq.(31), allows us to calculate the
pressure needed to “compress” a hydrogen atom in its
ground state to a certain size. This is given by

In conclusion, we have used a linear approximation
method to calculate the asymptotic dependence of the
ground-state energy of a hydrogen atom conﬁned to a
spherical cavity on the radius of the cavity. The bound-
ary correction to the energies of the excited states can be
obtained using the same method.

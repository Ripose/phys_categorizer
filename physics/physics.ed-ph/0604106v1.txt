Abstract

A simple setup was assembled to study the motion of an object while it falls. The setup was
used to determine the instantaneous velocity, terminal velocity and acceleration due to gravity.
Also, since the whole project was done within $20 it can easily be popularized.

1 Introduction

One of the ﬁrst topic students of physics learn is the concept of bodies falling towards the center
of the earth with an acceleration (g). This acceleration due to gravity is usually determined in
undergraduate laboratories by measuring the oscillation time period of a simple pendulum. Some
students do wonder as to why acceleration due to gravity is not just determined by measuring
the time taken by a freely falling body to fall through a given height. Trivial calculation using
the equation

s = ut +

(1)

shows that the body has to drop across an appreciable height to increase the body’s time of ﬂight.
This is required to minimize the error in measurement of the fall’s time. Historically this would
explain why Galileo did his experiment from the Tower of Pisa. Over the last three decades
various contraptions have been designed to measure the time of ﬂight in laboratory conditions
i.e. drop through limited height [1]-[9]. This has been made possible by the advent of cheap and
easily available electronic circuitry capable of measuring accurately in milliseconds. In most of
these experiments, the body is released by either a lever or electromagnet. The position of the
release mechanism would be taken as s=0 and the initial velocity on release would obviously be
zero. A second sensor kept at a distance one meter below the release point (s=0) would stop
the timing circuit when the body crosses it. The acceleration due to gravity is calculated using
eqn(1). However, this scheme introduces an error in time ’t’ due to the uncertainty in the time of
release. In Lindemuth’s [4] work, error was introduced due to the body having an initial velocity

2

by the time it arrived to the ﬁrst sensor that initiated the clock. In all schemes discussed, there
was an error either in the measurement of time of fall or knowledge of initial velocity. Also,
these experiments relay on the a prior knowledge/ validity of eqn(1). To overcome this problem
a method devised in use is to allow a metallic ball to drop in between two parallel wires in which
high tension current ﬂows in pulses. Sparks generated by the traveling ball is recorded on a
photographic strip. In another method two test masses to required to determine acceleration
due to gravity [1]. These techniques either require high (unsafe) voltages or the contraptions
require a certain amount of skill in designing which would not be easily available in standard
under-graduate colleges of developing countries.

We have designed a simple setup to measure the acceleration due to gravity. It was designed
keeping in mind minimum skill should be required to set it up and use it as also the validity
of eqn(1) would not be taken for granted.
In the following sections we elaborate our setup
designed by using LEDs, photodiodes, op amps and microprocessor and comment on the results
we obtained.

2 Apparatus

A hollow tube (which we shall hence refer to
as the ”drop tower”) of length 1meter housed
eight LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and eight
LDRs( Light Dependent Resistances). They
were arranged along the length of the drop tower
facing each other (see ﬁg 1). The distance be-
tween two neighboring LEDs (and in turn LDRs)
was 10cm. The ﬁrst pair of LED-LDR was kept
at a distance 10cm from the top edge of the drop
tower. This was to make sure that stray light
from the room did not lead to false triggering
of the circuitry.

LEDs

As the name suggests, LDRs are light light
sensitive devices and hence are popularly used
as optical sensors. Their resistance depends on
the amount of light falling on it. When light
is incident on the LDR, it’s resistance is low.
Thus, when a falling object cuts the lights path,
no light falls on the LDR and it’s resistance in-
creases. This variation in resistance when con-
verted into voltage can be (wave-)shaped into
pulses which then can be fed to a computer or microprocessor for identifying and storing the
information as to the instant the object passed the LDR. The required circuitry used for wave-
shaping is shown in ﬁg(2). The LDR resistance is converted into a corresponding voltage using
a voltage divider circuit. The voltage across the resistance, R1, is high (VH) when light falls
on the LDR since it’s resistance diminishes. Conversely, if the LDR is in shadow region it’s
resistance is high and the voltage across R1 goes low (VL). This voltage is given to the op amp

fall of a falling object.

comparator circuit. The variable voltage is set at a value between VL and VH. This ensures
that the output of the LM741 op amp swings to +12v when light falls on the LDR and to -12v
when shadow falls on it. This voltage is made TTL/microprocessor compatible (vary between 0
and +5v) using a 4.7v zener diode.

Figure 2: Wave-shaping circuit used to convert variation of LDR’s resistance into square pulses.
The DC supplies used were V1 = 5v and V2 = 12v and the resistances in the circuit were
R1 = 3.3KΩ, R2 = 10KΩ and R3 = 1KΩ. Diodes used were the usual 1N4001 rectiﬁcation
diodes.

Now we explain the ﬁnal block of our setup which is a IC8085 microprocessor training kit.
To follow in detail this section requires an understanding of IC8085 and can be acquired from
Gaonkar’s book. A standard 8085 microprocessor training kit comes with a programmable
input/output device (IC8155) which has as many as twenty two input pins (divided into Port
A with 8 pins, Port B with 8 pins and Port C with 6 pins). The output of each wave-shaping
circuit can be fed to one of these pins. We have only used eight pins of Port A. This was done
keeping the following in mind

(i) Optimize the amount of hardware (wave-shaping circuits),

(ii) eight data points would be reasonably enough to ﬁt a curve reliability and

(iii) the circuit then could easily be extended for interfacing with a computer since the com-

puters parallel port can only input eight bits.

Figure 3: Setup used to measure the time of fall of a falling object.

When no object cuts the light path, all the pins of Port A (of IC8155) are high and informs
the microprocessor by sending the word FFH (the subscript ’H’ means that it is the hexa repre-
sentation of binary number 1111 1111). This word changes when a object cuts the light’s path.
For example on cutting the ﬁrst LED-light’s path the word sent to the microprocessor is 1111
1110 (FEH) and when the object cuts the second LED-light’s path the microprocessor receives
the word 1111 1101 (FDH) and so forth as the object continuous to fall. The microprocessor
is programmed to run a counter (clock) from the negative edge of one input signal to that of
the second (see ﬁg 3). On receipt of the second input signal’s negative edge, the microprocessor
stores the counter’s count in it’s memory and restarts the counter. This contributes in an error
(time measured would be lower than actual) in the measurement of the time of ﬂight between
the next two pair of LED-LDR. The counts stored in the memory is converted to time in seconds
using the formula

t1 = (30n + 34) × 0.326µs
t2 to t8 = (30n + 41) × 0.326µs

Notice both the wave-shaping circuit and the software are designed to minimize any delay in
response by the cadmium sulphide LDR used. The assembly language instruction set used for
the project is listed at the end.

3 Results and Discussions

The drop tower was kept vertical and attempt was made to make sure that the objects would
fall in a straight line. A plumb line was used to ascertain the alignment. For conducting this
experiment we used four diﬀerent balls whose physical features, dimensions and mass are listed
in Table 1.

The balls were dropped from the top edge of the drop tower. We made sure that the ball in
use would cut all eight light beams. As soon as the ball crosses the ﬁrst LED, the microprocessor
starts it’s clock. This point would act as the co-ordinates (0,0). The microprocessor stores the
counter’s count as the ball passes the second LED (the count in turn would be used to calculate
time). This gives the co-ordinates (t21, 0.1) where the subscript ’21’ indicates this as the time

taken for the fall between the ﬁrst and second LED. Since, the LEDs are 10cm apart, in meters we
have s=0.1cm. In this manner, eight data points are generated and stored in the microprocessor.
The experiment was repeated as many as 200 times with each ball.

Fig(4) shows two curves each for the results obtained with Ball 1 and Ball 2. As can be seen
the data lie on a parabola. However, before ﬁtting a second polynomial that would represent
eq(1), one has to remember that eq(1) represents a object falling freely under the action of
gravity. No other forces should be acting on it. However, there are two possible forces acting in
the opposite direction to gravity when the object is dropped, namely forces of buoyancy and air
resistance. The contribution due to air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity
with which the object is moving. The general equation of motion in this case is given as

where mair is the mass of the air displaced by the ball and ’k’ is the proportionality constant.
Since, the dimensions of the balls are small, the volume and in turn the mass of air displaced is
very small. Hence, contributions of the buoyancy force can be neglected. Hence, the equation
of motion reduces to

Before proceeding, for completeness it should be stated here that the force acting as a resistance
on the falling body can either be proportional to it’s velocity (given by Navier-Strokes equation,
F = 6πµrv) or the square of the velocity. This depends if motion of the viscous medium around
the falling body remains laminar or not and is denoted by the Reynolds number (R)

where this number characterises the media (viscosity, µ and density, ρ) through which the body
(of diameter, d) falls with velocity, v. In a very viscous media (µ large), the body would face large
resistance and would fall slowly (v small). Thus the Reynolds number would be less than one.
Under such conditions the NAvier-Strokes equation should be considered. However, as in our
case, the body is falling through (dry) air, whose viscosity is small (around 1.9 × 10−5kg/m.sec)
with density 1.225kg/m3. The Reynolds number works out be ≈ 3000, i.e. R ≫ 1. The drag
force acting on the body is then given as

R =

F =

or k = 1
2 CDρA, where ’A’ is the area of cross-section and CD is the drag coeﬃcient. The drag
coeﬃcient depends on the shape, surface characteristics and the Reynolds number [10]. The
value of CD for smooth spheres as a function of Reynolds number has been listed in Landau
and Lifshitz book [11]. For R=3000, CD ≈ 0.5. For the radii of the balls used in our experiment
(see Table 1), k works out to be ≈ 3.8 × 10−4(Ns2/m2). However, we shall not use this value
immediately but at the end compare our experimentally determined values with this theoretical
value.

is the terminal velocity the falling body would achieve when it moves with no acceleration, i.e.
net force acting on it is zero in the case of free fall else when all other higher terms cancel out.
The coeﬃcient of t3 represents the rate of change in acceleration (dg/dt).

Thus, under the conditions in which this experiment was done, the data points were ﬁt with
a third order polynomial (eqn 3). Curves were ﬁt to these data points using standard and freely
available software ”Curxpt v3.0”.

All the curves for the 200 odd experiments done with each ball lie within the two curves
shown in ﬁg(4). The coeﬃcient of t, t2 and t3 as returned by the software was used to determine
the ball’s velocity (u1) as it crosses the ﬁrst sensor where the ball has traveled through 10+cm
(10cm from the drop tower’s top edge to the ﬁrst sensor and the unknown height from the edge
from where the ball was dropped) and it’s acceleration (g). Results for the graphs shown in
ﬁg(4) are listed in Table 2. The error in ’g’ is 1 in part of 103 with as small as +7µsec (max)
error in the measurement of time of ﬂight. The acceleration due to gravity in Delhi can be
calculated using the equation

g = 9.780327[1 + 0.0053024sin2L − 0.000058sin22L]

(4)

where 0.499455 (28o37′N) is the latitude (L) of Delhi in radian. This gives the acceleration due
to gravity in Delhi as 9.7918m/s2. Our experimental value of ’g’ is in good agreement with
the theoretical value. Notice that the velocity (u1) is diﬀerent in each case (see Table 2). This
is expected since even with the best of care taken, the balls would have been dropped from
diﬀerent heights (position from the drop tower’s edge).

The power series of eqn(3) suggests that a knowledge of the coeﬃcients should also enable
us to estimate the objects terminal velocity. However, the power approximation leads to the
situation that if the body’s initial velocity is zero then the terms associated with terminal velocity
also collapses. Also, curve ﬁtting the original solution relating distance to time proves tedious
due to the existence of logaritm and cosine hyperbolic terms. However, the functional relation
between velocity and time for a body falling through a viscous medium is given as [4]

to generate data for curve ﬁtting eqn(5) or ﬁnd the gradient along the curves shown in ﬁg(4).
Both methods would introduce an error abid small since the ﬁtting as represented by co-relation
factor (see Table 2) was very good. The terminal velcoities thus evaluated is listed in Table
3. Before concluding, it would be interesting to compute the time a body would take to attain
terminal velcoity and the distance through which it would fall to attain this velocity. For this
one would have to solve the quadratic equation

and substitute the time taken thus obtained in the equation

vT = gt − 3

The data of Table 3 indicates that the terminal velocity, the time in which the object attains
this velocity and the distance through which it has to travel for attaining the same all strongly
depends on the objects mass. The drag coeﬃcient also depends on the surface area (and hence
diameter) hence comparison was sort to be done on balls with similar diameter and diﬀerent
mass. Obtaining balls of diﬀerent mass and similar dimensions was not easy. However, the
designed experimental setup proved handy in estimating the acceleration due to gravity. Above
which, it also proved to be a rich source of information on the motion of an object while falling.
Providing ample scope of and experience in data analysis, the setup gives an idea of the terminal
velocity, time taken to achieve it and the distance through which the body has to travel before
attaining it. All this is possible eventhough the length of the drop tower is less than the distance
through which object has to fall to attain vT. On a ﬁnal note it must be mentioned that this
project was done in a graduate college laboratory, with a small budget of $20.

Krivine and Lesne use an example taken from The Feynman Lectures[2] in an attempt to
illustrate that “many interesting physical properties can however be missed because of the improper
use of mathematical techniques”.[1] The supposedly incorrect mathematical procedure has to do
with an ordering of limits. An inﬁnite series that is convergent in the presence of a small parameter
no longer converges when the parameter is set to zero before the series is summed.

The authors, correctly in my view, emphasize the physical importance of distinguishing be-
tween inﬁnite systems and large ﬁnite systems. In their example discontinuities in certain physical
quantities only exist (mathematically) for inﬁnite systems.

I suggest, however, that the authors have demonstrated a diﬀerent mathematical point than the
one that they propose: inﬁnite series live a life of their own and need not be constrained to be the
limit of sequences of ﬁnite series. This point was made long ago by Borel and was probably known
to Abel and Cauchy[4].
I emphasize the point with an example of an inﬁnite series of resistive
elements that sum to a negative resistance. The inﬁnite series represents diﬀerent physics from any
of the possible ﬁnite series.

Let {Ri} be a set of resistors, each having resistance Ri = piR p > 1 and R an arbitrary
n
resistance value. Then Zn = P
i=0 Ri is the resistance of a set of such resistors connected in
series, and the value of Zn grows without bound as n increases. Clearly, a quantity Z deﬁned by
Z ≡ P

∞
n=0 Rn makes no sense as a limit of a convergent sequence of ﬁnite sums.

We may, however, emulate Feynman[2] and deﬁne Z from the recursive relation Z − R = pZ
which follows from the deﬁnition of Z and the fact that an inﬁnite series less a ﬁnite set of its
members is still an inﬁnite series1. Solving the last equation for Z leads to the result that

Z = −R/(p − 1)

(1)

a negative resistance.

Feynman[2] also shows us how to build such inﬁnite-series resistors. One simply terminates a
ﬁnite-series resistor having resistance Zn with a negative resistance having resistance −pn+1R/(p −
1). Each such resistor will then have negative resistance Z.

When the quantity p has values p < 1, there is no diﬀerence between the limit of a sequence
Zn of increasing n and the value Z obtained in Eq. 1. This does not mean that Eq. 1 is wrong,
as the authors of Ref. 2 seem to imply. It does mean that the inﬁnite sum involved represents two
diﬀerent physical situations when p < 1 and when p > 1, involving, respectively passive and active
circuit elements.

This Comment is intended, however, to emphasize the mathematical fact that inﬁnite (and in-
ﬁnitesimal) mathematical operations may be justiﬁed independently of arguments involving limits.[5]
I am indebted to Cosmas Zachos for bringing the Borel reference to my attention. This work

1The series, in fact, satisﬁes Hardy’s criteria of X-summability[3]

A spaceship with one thruster producing a constant magnitude force is analyzed for various
initial conditions. This elementary problem, with one object acted upon by one force, has value as a
challenge to one’s physical intuition and in demonstrating the beneﬁts and limitations of dimensional
analysis. In addition, the problem can serve to introduce a student to special functions, provide a
mechanical model for Fresnel integrals and the associated Cornu spiral, or be used as an example in
a numerical methods course. The problem has some interesting and perhaps unexpected features.

INTRODUCTION

A problem involving one constant magnitude force act-
ing on one body leads to interesting motion and is useful
as a teaching tool when discussing physical intuition and
dimensional analysis. The problem can be solved with
elementary mechanics with the solution expressed in the
form of integrals associated with known special functions.
We ﬁrst state the problem and then proceed with its solu-
tion, though we invite the reader to ponder the problem
before reading the solution and the remainder of the ar-
ticle. After the solution is presented we discuss what
one could have ascertained from an astute application of
physical intuition. Next, dimensional analysis is applied
to the problem. We hope instructors will ﬁnd the richness
of such a simple to state problem to be of value in teach-
ing and in challenging students. In addition, the problem
can be attacked analytically to a large degree and thus
comparison of analytic (and asymptotic expressions) to
numerical solutions could be instructive in a numerical
methods course.

II. THE PROBLEM

Imagine a spaceship with one thruster positioned a dis-
tance R from the center of mass as depicted in Fig. 1.
Initially the ship is at rest. At time t = 0, the thruster
is ﬁred and produces a constant tangential force, F . De-
scribe the motion of the ship. What path does the cen-
ter of mass move along? Assume special relativity is not
needed and that the mass of the spaceship/thruster com-
bination does not change. What else can one intuit about
the motion? The solution follows immediately so we sug-
gest the reader formulate opinions about the motion be-
fore proceeding.

A. The solution to the problem

Three equations, one from the torque of the thruster,
and the other two from the x and y components of the
force of the thruster, deﬁne the motion. Let θ be the
angle the thruster has rotated about its center of mass
since time t = 0. Initially, the ship will move in the x

direction and then upward into the ﬁrst quadrant as it
begins to rotate as shown in Fig. 2.

From the torque on the system about the center of
mass, the rotational analog of Newton’s second law (τ =
I ¨θ) requires

F R = c mR2 ¨θ

(1)

where the moment of inertia is I = c mR2, where c is a

dimensionless constant that depends on the distribution
of mass (e.g. 1
2 for a disk, but in general any positive
number), m is the mass of the ship, R is the distance
from the center of mass to the thruster, and ¨θ is the
second derivative of θ(t) with respect to time. Solving
for the angle as a function of time we have

assuming θ(0) = ˙θ(0) = 0. The case of ˙θ(0)
explored later in the paper.

studied and are called Fresnel integrals1. Their evalua-
tion is aided by a plot called the Cornu Spiral, which is
shown in Fig. 3. Note the analysis required to this point
was within the level of the typical elementary calculus-
based physics course, though the integrals have led to
special functions.

Examining the Fresnel integrals for the velocity com-
ponents reveals much about the motion of the center of
mass.
, each component of veloc-
ity goes to
πcF R/4m. Therefore, the center of mass
moves oﬀ at a 45 degree angle with respect to the x-
axis as time approaches inﬁnity. The Cornu Spiral, most
commonly associated with the problem of diﬀraction of
a rectangular aperture2, represents these two integrals
graphically. Fig. 3 is the Cornu Spiral as it is often
displayed1,2. A point on this spiral (when multiplied by
the factor
πcF R/m) represents the x and y compo-
nents of velocity at a point in time. A line drawn from
the origin to a point on the spiral represents the instanta-
neous direction of the motion of the center of mass. Thus
from this plot we see the center of mass is always in the
ﬁrst quadrant since vx and vy are always positive. And
since vx is positive at all times then the plot of motion
in the y versus x plane is single valued.

versus the Fresnel cosine integral, C(z) =

problem, runs along the spiral with a tick every 0.2 stopping
at 3.0. For the spaceship problem the axes are proportional
to the x and y velocity components. The central portion
of the spiral near (0.5, 0.5) is not plotted for clarity. The
three straight lines on the plot represent the velocities with
the steepest direction, the terminal speed, and the maximum
speed, respectively in a clockwise fashion.

Fig. 3 also reveals a maximum speed (depicted by the
longest straight line) which is approximately equal to
1.3422v∞, where v∞ (straight line to center of spiral) rep-
resents the speed of the center of mass as time approaches
inﬁnity. The plot also shows a maximum angle with re-
spect to the x-axis for the trajectory approximately equal
to 60.466◦, independent of any other parameters. Thus
if the thruster is ﬁred for an appropriate ﬁnite period
of time, one could obtain a trajectory anywhere between
zero and 60.466◦ with respect to the x-axis, or a terminal
velocity anywhere between zero and 1.3422v∞.

Thus the path of motion can be studied analytically
through the Fresnel special functions and its associated
Cornu spiral.

A plot of the motion is shown in Fig. 4. The shape
of the path is universal regardless of parameter values
though distances are scaled by the factor c R. Note that
the asymptotic trajectory as projected back towards the
origin does not pass through the origin but has a non-zero
x-intercept. Analytic analysis of the asymptotic (t
)

forms of equations 9 and 10 show this intercept occurs
x = c R. Curiously, while the thruster delivers equal
x and y components of impulse (change in momentum)
as time approaches inﬁnity to the center of mass, there
is an asymmetry in the displacement as shown by this
intercept (due to vx being greater than vy initially). For
actual spacecraft maneuvers we see a single thruster is
not a very practical conﬁguration.

III. PHYSICAL INTUITION

It has been our experience that the majority of stu-
dents and faculty alike have diﬃculty intuiting the mo-
tion of the center of mass. Physical intuition is not a

3

well deﬁned term. An interesting recent book entitled
Seeking Ultimates: An Intuitive Guide to Physics3 states
intuition is something for a student “to absorb in their
bones.” The dictionary4 deﬁnes intuition as

1a) the act or faculty of knowing without the
use of rational processes; immediate cognition
b) knowledge acquired by use of this faculty.
2.) acute insight

We feel a deﬁnition of “physical intuition” requires more.
A recent article by Singh5 agrees that physical intuition
is diﬃcult to deﬁne but oﬀers these words:

Cognitive theory suggests that those with
good intuition can eﬀectively pattern-match
or map a given problem onto situations with
which they have experience.

These words provide a suitable footing for the term be-
cause below we relate the problem at hand to a more
common problem, which most physicists have had expe-
rience with during the course of their education. Perhaps
“absorb in their bones” is on the mark if interpreted as
absorbing a number of standard problems to provide a
bank with which to pattern match.

A. Center of mass has a terminal velocity

The simplest idea is that as the object spins faster and
faster the impulse to the center of mass over a single
revolution must tend to zero. Therefore the change in
linear momentum tends to zero and thus the notion of
a terminal velocity for the center of mass is reasonable
(though not guaranteed, the harmonic series tends to zero
but it’s sum does not).

The ﬁrst half of a revolution takes longer than the sec-
ond and thus it must be the case that the impulse is
always positive in the y direction for any time and the
motion is conﬁned to the upper half plane. In addition,
y plotted as a function of time is monotonically increas-
ing. One may be tempted to draw similar conclusions for
the x direction but here things are trickier, especially for
whether a plot of x versus time is monotonically increas-
ing. To see this consider a slightly diﬀerent problem.

B. An alternate spaceship problem

If the spaceship’s thruster had acted through its center
of mass and had a rotation rate given by ωo, as pictured
in Fig. 5, then we could say something about the x com-
ponent of velocity. During the ﬁrst quarter of rotation
the x component of acceleration is positive and the x
component of velocity goes from 0 to some maximum.
During the second quarter of rotation the x component
of acceleration is negative and the symmetry of the ap-
plied force dictates that this acceleration will reduce the

x component of velocity to zero. During the last half of
the rotation the x component of velocity will be negative
and the symmetry of the kinematics would return the x
component of the center of mass to x = 0. Then, as far
as the x direction is concerned, the whole thing starts
over again. The overall motion, assuming θ(t) = ωot, is
a cycloid, reminiscent of the motion of a charged par-
ticle starting at rest in orthogonal uniform electric and
magnetic ﬁelds.

The velocity components are

assuming vx = vy = 0. And the positions would be given
by

The path is depicted in Fig. 6 and the shape of the
path is also universal, though the axes are scaled by the

o. One possible mistake is to confuse con-
stant rotation with uniform circular motion. But uniform
circular motion is not a correct analogy since the force
of the thruster is not, in general, perpendicular to the
velocity of the center of mass.

C. Spaceship is stuck in the ﬁrst quadrant

Returning to the original problem, the rotation rate is
not constant, but increases. As such we would expect

the particle to never return to x = 0 since the time spent
in each rotation thrusting with a positive x component
will be longer than the time spent with a negative x com-
ponent. Thus the spaceship is doomed to remain in the
ﬁrst quadrant for all its travels contrary to a common
misconception that the spaceship may move in some sort
of spiral around the origin.

As mentioned earlier, we note the actual path of the
center of mass as described by a function y(x) is single-
valued, meaning physically that the x component of ve-
locity (as well as the y velocity component) is always
positive. However, had there been an initial rotation,
ω2
ocmR/F = 1 for example, then there would have been
a negative x component of velocity during the ﬁrst ro-
tation and thus y(x) would have been double valued for
some x values as shown in Fig. 7. The situation of a
thruster with initial rotation is discussed in detail below.
It is hoped the above discussion sheds some light on
why the 45-degree asymptotic path, the non-zero x-
intercept, and the single-valued nature of y(x) are dif-
ﬁcult to intuit, even in hindsight. They depend on the
value of integrals that are not intuitive (without the aid
of the Cornu spiral or some other such device).

We did succeed in providing an “intuitive” explanation
to explain that the path of motion is all in the ﬁrst quad-
rant by comparing to an alternative known elementary
problem. And, we intuited the notion of a terminal ve-
locity and thus the asymptotic path for large times is a
straight line.

In the interest of full disclosure, we add that our ini-
tial thoughts on the motion weren’t always right, and
we wrote this section with the beneﬁt of hindsight from
solving the equations of motion.

case is 1. The axes are in units of c R. Note the x component
of velocity is negative for a period during the ﬁrst rotation
(near x = y = 1).

IV. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

Dimensional analysis has been discussed, for example,
in association with models and data utilizing the simple
pendulum as an example6, in a simple experiment in-
volving the ﬂow of sand7, and in the error analysis of a
falling body8. This problem lends itself to dimensional
analysis, the most interesting example being the terminal
velocity. The characteristic mass is m, length is R, and
time is
mR/F . A fourth parameter for the problem
is actually dimensionless, the parameter c from the form
factor of the moment of inertia. Though dimensionless
one can usually predict whether a quantity should in-
crease or decrease as a function of c, though the power
of the dependance on c is unobtainable by such analysis.
Table I list a few quantities of possible interest, such as
terminal velocity (v∞) and the x intercept of the asymp-
totic path, along with the actual value and a dimensional
estimate. Note all numerical prefactors of the estimates
are within a factor of ten of the actual prefactor.

A. Dimensional analysis of the alternate problem

To physically understand the motion we introduced the
alternate problem of a spaceship initially rotating with
thrust acting through the center of mass. This eﬀec-
tively eliminates the radius, R, from the problem (since
no torque is available the rotation rate will not change),
but it introduced a new parameter, the initial rotation

length is F/mω2

o, and time is 1/ωo.

Table II is analogous to Table I for this alternate prob-
lem. Note again all numerical prefactors of the estimates
are within a factor of ten of the actual prefactor.

B. Original problem with initial rotation

If the original problem had been initially rotating then
there would have been two length scales, two time scales,
and even two mass scales. The second mass scale would
be given by F/Rω2
o. With two sets of characteristic
scales, dimensional analysis is of less value because there
are an inﬁnite number of ways to construct quantities
of interest. For example, let l1, m1, t1 be a characteris-
tic length, mass and time respectively, and let l2, m2, t2
be a second set. Suppose we’re curious about a velocity.
Obvious possibilities are l1/t1 and l2/t2. But

are examples of other possibilities.

Consider the initial problem but now allow an initial
rotation rate as well. The velocity components would be
given by the integrals:

(17)

Our intuition says the terminal velocity should decrease
as ωo increases (for positive ωo, i.e. in the direction of
the applied torque). Dimensional analysis for a velocity
reveals ambiguities such as:

The new velocity integrals can still be interpreted with
the aid of the Cornu spiral. By completing the square of
the arguments of the trigonometric functions, an initial
rotation can be shown to be a shift of
oc mR/πF
along the spiral and a rotation of axis by an angle of
ω2
oc mR/2F as shown in Fig. 8, where the shifted axes are
placed for an initial rotation satisfying ω2

responding to ω2

velocities are obtained by multiplying the axes by the factor

With the aid of this shifted axis, we see the termi-
nal velocity should indeed get smaller and also the angle
of the trajectory should increase. Also, both vx and vy
should approach zero as ωo approaches inﬁnity. However,
since the trajectory tends to 90 degrees from the x-axis
we note vx and vy cannot tend to zero with
as ωo → ∞
the same dependence on ωo.

V. PATH OF MOTION WITH A NEGATIVE
INITIAL ROTATION

Since we have just generalized the original problem to
include a non-zero initial rotation aligned with the ap-
plied torque, it is interesting to consider a negative initial
rotation, i.e. initially spinning opposite the direction of
the applied torque. Fig. 9 displays the path of the center
of mass for the situation ω2
ocmR/F = 25 and with ωo
being negative (i.e. opposite the direction of the torque).
Notice that the displacement vector, for this case, sweeps
a polar angle somewhere between 270 and 360 degrees.
This raises questions: What is the maximum this angle
could be? Could the spaceship spiral around the origin,
with an appropriate initial rotation, as some incorrectly
suggest for the original problem with no initial rotation?
Our explorations reveal that with an appropriate choice
of a negative ωo the asymptotic path can be any com-
pass heading in the full 360 degree range of possibilities.
Fig. 10 shows four such possibilities associated with four
diﬀerent initial rotation rates.

A. Can the center of mass circle the origin? No

As before, using integration by parts the components
of position can be expressed in terms of the velocity com-
ponents. We ﬁnd:

where vx(t) and vy(t) are those given by equations 16
and 17 respectively. For the spaceship to circle the origin
a necessary, but not suﬃcient, condition is that vy = 0
while y > 0. Examining equation 22, we see that if vy = 0
then

y

|vy=0 = cR[cos(

F t2

−

(23)

must be positive if we are to meet this condition. But
this cannot ever be true since the most the cosine term
could be is 1. Therefore once y > 0 the spaceship will
remain in the upper half plane. Note the above proof
does not require any properties of the Fresnel functions,
just integration by parts.

B. What is the displacement vector’s maximum
polar angle?

Numerically, we have determined the maximum angle
the displacement vector can sweep while going around

FIG. 11: The polar angle swept by the displacement vector
(in degrees) from t = 0 to t = ∞ as a function of the initial
rotation rate ωo in units of

correspond to paths that intersect the origin. Thus, qualita-

tively, at the discontinuity the path went from one like that
in Fig. 9 where it was going around the origin to one like that
in the top right of Fig. 10 where it cut back below the origin.

VI. CONCLUSION

As one object (see appendix), one force problems go,
this one may rival the simple harmonic oscillator for its
richness. The problem has utility in introducing a stu-
dent to special functions and handbooks such as Abro-
mowitz and Stegun1. It also provides a mechanical model
for thinking about Fresnel integrals. It could be used in
a numerical methods course where comparison between
analytic (and analytic asymptotic) expressions versus nu-
merical techniques could be performed. The dimensional
analysis applied to this problem is useful for many other

8

problems. For example, projectile motion possesses a
universal path shape, a parabola, characterized by the di-
mensionless parameter the launch angle with the length
scale set by v2
o/g where vo is the initial velocity and g
the acceleration due to gravity. When presenting a new
problem to a student, a good question to ask is to try
to sort out how many sets of scales does the problem en-
compass and what can dimensional arguments say about
the answers to any questions posed. Finally, the problem
is a challenging test of physical intuition and it can be of
interest to the teacher and student alike to think about
just what is meant by such a term as “physical intuition”
and how would one go about improving it.

Integrating the x-component, for example, over one
revolution (from 0 to 2π) should be equivalent to evalu-

With the substitution θ = F t2/2c mr this is shown

APPENDIX: THE OTHER OBJECT(S) -
MOMENTUM CONSERVATION

The title stated there is only one body in this prob-
lem and indeed the spaceship with its attached thruster
has been our focus. But momentum conservation sug-
gests this cannot be the only thing in our universe. The
thruster must be emitting something (perhaps a photon)
that carries momentum (and also energy and angular mo-
mentum). The momentum is carried away in all direc-
tions since the spaceship rotates. The magnitude of the
instantaneous impulse imparted by the thruster, is F dt.
The impulse per angular bin from θ to θ+dθ as a function
of θ using Eq. 2 is then:

F dt

Abstract: Understanding the deﬂection of light by a massive deﬂector,
as well as the associated gravitational lens phenomena, require the use of the
theory of General Relativity. I consider here a classical approach, based on
Newton’s equation of motion for massive particles. These particles are emit-
ted by a distant source and deﬂected by the gravitational ﬁeld of a (opaque)
star or of a (transparent) galaxy. The dependence of the deviation angle
D on the impact parameter b, and the geometry of the (source, deﬂector,
earth) triplet, imply that diﬀerent particle trajectories may reach an earth
based observer. Since D(b) does not depend on the mass of the particles, it
is tempting to set the particles’ velocity equal to the speed of light to get a
(Newtonian) ﬂavor of gravitational lenses phenomena. Orders of magnitude
are obtained through a non technical approach and can be compared to the
General Relativity results.

1 Introduction

Gravitational lenses phenomena [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] rest on the gravitational de-
ﬂection of light, and their explanation require the use of General Relativity
(the gravitational deﬂection of light by the sun was indeed a major issue at
the very beginning of the theory). For quasistationary isolated mass distri-
butions, the evolution of the unit tangent vector (~e(s)) to a light ray (~r(s))
is given to lowest order by [2]

d~e(s)
ds

= −

~∇⊥U

2
c2

(1)

where c is the speed of light, and U the gravitational potential created by
the mass distribution (for a point mass M, U = − GM
|~r(s)| ). In equation (1),
the operator ~∇⊥ is the projection of ~∇U onto the plane perpendicular to the
direction ~e of the light ray.

Equation (1) bears some resemblance with a classical equation of motion;
it is indeed a familiar remark that Newton’s classical equation for a massive
particle in the gravitational ﬁeld of a deﬂector leads to a mass independent
deﬂection angle (identity of inertial and gravitational masses). Setting the
particle velocity equal to the speed of light (v0 = c) yields a “photon” deﬂec-
tion angle which is wrong, but of the same order of magnitude as the General
Relativity result (see below). We follow here this wrong-but-simple view of
the gravitational deﬂection of light.

A detailed study of the classical mechanical problem deﬁned by the triplet
(particle source (S), deﬂector (∆), earth based observer (E)), shows that, in
some cases, several particle trajectories may reach the Earth. In “photon”
language, these trajectories translate into a basic gravitational lensing eﬀect:
the source (S) may give multiple images for the observer (E).

An important ingredient of this mechanical study is the dependence of the
gravitational deﬂection angle D on the impact parameter b of the particles.
Since the (Euclidean) distances between (S),(∆) and (E) are ﬁnite, the exact
calculation of D(b) is rather involved, even if one takes advantage of the
central character of the gravitational force and of some invariant properties
(we brieﬂy consider in the Appendix the Runge-Lenz vector or tensor).

A very qualitative approach is used here to derive the main features of the
deﬂection D(b) for the case of spherical deﬂectors (radius R), and to further
“interpret” the results in photon terms. The plan of the paper is as follows.

2

The gravitational action of the deﬂector, such as the sun (opaque star) or the
Milky Way (transparent galaxy), is studied in Section 2. For simplicity, we
assume there that the source (S) and the observer (E) are both at inﬁnity.
When (S) and (E) are at a ﬁnite distance from the deﬂector, a little bit
of (Euclidean) geometry shows that that (S) may have multiple “images”
(Section 3). Finally, an estimate of the time lag between the reception of these
“images” is obtained, via a non technical analogy with geometrical optics
and Fermat principle. Orders of magnitude are compared with the General
Relativity results. Some rigorous results for central forces are postponed to
an Appendix.

2 Deﬂectors, qualitative deﬂection D(b), and

orders of magnitude

We consider a source (S) which emits, in an isotropic fashion, isovelocity
particles (|~v| = v0). Unless otherwise stated, we will consider a point source.
We focus our interest on the deﬂector and take the source and the observer
at inﬁnity. Let ~v0 = v0~ux be the initial velocity of a test particle. The impact
parameter b and deviation angle D are deﬁned in Figure 1.

The deﬂector (∆) may be either opaque or transparent to the particles.
The former case will be illustrated by the sun (radius R⊙ ≃ 7 · 108m and
mass M⊙ ≃ 2 · 1030kg), and the latter by a spherical version of the Milky
Way 1 (radius RG ≃ 2 · 104 light years (ly) 2 and mass MG ≃ 1012M⊙).

Let us ﬁrst consider the case of the (transparent) galaxy. The equation of
motion may be obtained from the calculation of the gravitational ﬁeld ~g(~r).
Two distinct phases of the motion are to be considered (b > RG and b < RG),
since the gravitational ﬁeld on the test particle has diﬀerent expressions. We
respectively denote these phases by (out) and (in), and their contribution to
the total deviation D(b) will be called D(in) and D(out). We further assume
that the galaxy is homogeneous, and neglect all collisions with the particles in
phase (in). A preliminary remark is that D(b) is not a monotonous function,
since it vanishes both for b = 0 and b = ∞ (Figure 1).

elliptic or partially elliptic. One should express the initial and ﬁnal boundary
conditions to get the deﬂection D(in)(b). These boundary conditions depend
on phase (out) of the trajectory (b > RG), where Newton’s equation reads

The total deviation D(b) is given by

More rigorous results are given in the Appendix. For the time being, I will
restrict myself to qualitative arguments to obtain orders of magnitude.
For very small b (b << RG), the particle will spend a time τ ∼ RG

in the
deﬂector. Assuming that the time τ is small compared to the time scale of
the motion T0, we may approximately consider the action of the gravitational
force as an impulse and write

The linear dependence of the gravitational ﬁeld g(in)(b) on b leads one to
view f as the focal length of the deﬂector, since particles with diﬀerent b ’s will
be focused at the same point [6]. As previously mentioned, the contribution
D(out)(b) goes to zero as b goes to zero. So it is not unreasonable to extent
the linear character of equation (5) to the full deviation, and to assume that

D(b) ∼ C

The rigorous small b calculation of D(b) , sketched in the Appendix, indeed
shows that this assumption holds with C = 3.

For a very large impact parameter b (b >> R, i.e. phase (out)), both
kind of deﬂectors may be treated together 3. Had gravity been a ﬁnite range
force, we could have again modeled its action on the particle as an impulse
δpy ∼ Fy(b)δt, with Fy(b) ∼ mg(out) ∼ GM m

with M = M⊙ or M = MG. As shown in the Appendix, the exact value of
D(b), which takes into account the long range character of gravity, is twice
the impulse estimate of equation (7).

Using the results of equations (6,7), we show in Figure 2 the qualitative
(total) deviation D(b) as a function of the impact parameter b, for opaque
and transparent deﬂectors.

Setting v0 = c = 3 · 108ms−1 for photonic purposes, one obtains the
following orders of magnitude. For our model galaxy we have f ∼ 2.5 · 109 ly
(compared to RG ≃ 2 · 104 ly), and a grazing incidence deviation D(RG) ∼
8·10−6 rd. For the sun we get a grazing incidence value D(R⊙) ∼ 2.1·10−6rd.
Even if we are oﬀ by a factor of two or three from the exact classical results
of the Appendix, these estimates show the the deﬂection angle is typically of
order 10−5 − 10−6 rd both for stars and galaxies. They qualitatively agree
with the General Relativity (GR) results for photons (DGR(b) = 4 GM
bc2 , b large
and DGR(b) = 6b

f , b small).

3 Gravitational lens phenomena

We now use our qualitative results to discuss an experimentally more relevant
situation, where both the source (S) and the observer (E) are at a ﬁnite
distance from the deﬂector (∆). The geometry is shown in Figure 3. We
have rS = S∆, rE = ∆E, and β =
SE∆. The deviation, as well as all other
angles are small. This implies in particular that b << rE, rS. We have from

b with the minimum distance approach (see the Appendix and Figure 3).

3.2 Einstein rings

This case corresponds to the alignment of (S),(∆) and (E) (β = 0). Due to
the symmetry of revolution around the S∆E axis, all (phase (out)) trajec-
tories on the angular cone θ = θE = b
rE reach the earth. In photon language,
this means that the observer sees a ring image of the point source S. For a
transparent deﬂector, one also has a direct (phase (in)) image. For our model
galaxy and rE ∼ rS ∼ 109 ly, a typical value is θE ∼ 10−5 rd.

3.3 The case of a moving deﬂector

We brieﬂy consider this case (called microlensing), because of its experimen-
tal relevance. Since a detailed comparison with the experiments require the
use of General Relativity [1, 2, 3], we again limit our presentation to orders
of magnitude calculations. If the deﬂector (∆) moves, with a velocity v∆, in
a direction perpendicular to the (SE) axis (Figure 3), the above calculations
for β = 0 (ring image), there is a sudden
suggest the following scenario:
increase in the signal received by the observer, since two trajectories only
survive for β 6= 0. Physically the transition is gradual, and the observer will
receive a gravitationally enhanced signal when the position of deﬂector (∆) is
within a distance bE ∼ rEθE from the full alignment position of the previous
section 4 The corresponding time interval is tE ∼ bE
v∆ . For distant sources
(rS >> rE), an experimental situation corresponding to a sun-like deﬂector ,
with v∆ ∼ 200 km s−1, rE ∼ 3.6 104 ly and v0 = c, yields an enhanced signal
during an interval tE ∼ 106 − 107 s, of order one month.

3.4 Time lags

We have seen that several trajectories- or light rays- may reach (E) because of
the gravitational deﬂection. Can one further extend the mechanical-optical
analogy by ﬁnding the time lag between the reception of these trajectories
-or light rays- ?

Sticking to our non technical approach, we ﬁrst consider the transparent
deﬂector (phase (in) of the trajectory). For small b, we estimated D(b) ∼ C b
f
4A simple way to calculate the ampliﬁcation factor is to use the non linear relation
θ(β) of equation (13). The ﬂux emitted by an extended source is proportional to βdβ, and
the ﬂux received by the observer is proportional to θdθ. The total ampliﬁcation factor is
given by A = | θdθ

βdβ |1 + | θdθ

may be understood through a gravitational index n(in)

The formal equivalence of a central force motion (potential V (r), energy E)
with a geometrical optics problem (optical index nV (r)) is sketched in the
Appendix. We have [7]

where m is the mass of the particle.

In the appropriate small r limit for gravitation, we get n(in)

for phase (in). In classical terms, the deﬂector’s gravity has slowed down the
particle. Deﬁning an analog Lgrav of the optical path, the gravitational time
delay δtgrav due to the presence of the deﬂector is given by

since the thickness of the deﬂector is of order RG (phase (in)). Setting v0 = c,
we ﬁnd δtgrav ∼ 107 s (i.e. of the order of a few months).

Within the optical analogy, it is straightforward to calculate gravitational
ngrav(r) ds) along the diﬀerent possible trajec-
paths `a la Fermat (Lgrav =

trajectories (1) and (2) of section 3.1 thus reads

[2] yields δt12 ∼ GM

way, on the geometrical parameters (β, rS, ...).

Neglecting this geometrical factor and setting v0 = c, we ﬁnd δt12 ∼ 10−5
s for the sun, and (again) δt12 ∼ 107 s for our model galaxy. Experiments
that conﬁrm the double reception of the same “signal”, with a time interval
of order several months, can be found in references [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

4 Conclusion

We have studied, at a very qualitative level, a classical mechanical introduc-
tion to gravitational lens phenomena. This approach rests on the fact that
the gravitational deﬂection of a massive particle by a deﬂector is independent
of the particle mass. It is only an approximation to the theory of General
Relativity [8, 9], but I believe that this “ ~F = m~a optics ” [10, 11] brings
together in a very pedagogical way problems of diﬀerent origins. In particu-
lar, we have derived orders of magnitude that can be compared, in a rather
reasonable way to the correct results.

Beside the study of General Relativity, the interested student can carry
further the present approach in several ways.
I will only quote here the
modeling of gravitational lenses by optical lenses of the appropriate shape
[4], or the link between equations (2) and (3) stemming from conformal
transformations [12].

It is a pleasure to thank F. Bernardeau for discussions.

Appendix

In this Appendix, we gather some facts about Kepler and harmonic mo-

tions.

Starting with Kepler motion (large b), we ﬁrst assume that the source (S)
and the earth (E) are at inﬁnity. The deﬂection angle of a particle of mass
m is deﬁned by the angle between ﬁnal and initial velocities of the particle
in the (S∆E) plane. A quick way to obtain D(b) is to use the Runge-Lenz
invariant vector

~A = ~v × ~L − GMm

where ~L = ~r ×m~v is the angular momentum of the particle. Writing ~Ai = ~Af

Since D ∼ 10−6 rd, we may take b ≃ r0.
For a galaxy, the above formulae apply, as long as the minimum distance
approach (or, for all practical purposes, the impact parameter b) is larger
than RG. For impact parameters b < RG, the particles enter the deﬂector,
where their motion is governed by equation (2). The quickest way to obtain
the corresponding deviation D(in) is perhaps to use the Runge-Lenz (matrix
or tensor) invariant associated with the harmonic oscillator

Starting from the invariance of A, simple calculations, see e.g.

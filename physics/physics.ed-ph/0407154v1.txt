INTRODUCTION

In this article we present a derivation of the ther-
mal equations of state of ideal quantum gases by using
solely dimensional analysis, thermodynamic considera-
tions and simple physical arguments1. The thermody-
namic relations of gases depend strongly on the energy-
momentum relation of the gas particles and on their spin,
i.e. whether the particles are fermions or bosons. The
energy-momentum relation of ideal gases can be written
as

where ν = 1, 2 for relativistic and non-relativistic par-
ticles, respectively. m denotes the rest mass of massive
particles, c is the velocity of light. For massless quasi-
particles like phonons or magnons (in anti-ferromagnets)
c denotes the sound and spin wave velocity, respectively.
Considering a homogeneous gas of N particles conﬁned
in a container of volume V = vN and coupled to a bath
of temperature T , the free energy can be written in the
form

F (T, V, N ) = N F (T, v, 1) = N f (T, v) .

(1.2)

f (t, v) is the free energy per particle. The mean sepa-
ration a between particles is related to the volume per
particle v = ad, where d denotes the dimension of the

system. The pressure follows then from p =

II. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS

In a classical gas, to begin with, the pressure can only
depend on T , a and c or m for the relativistic or non-
relativistic case, respectively. Since the temperature T
appears in all relations of statistical physics in combi-
nation with the Boltzmann constant kB, which converts
energy in degrees Kelvin, we will put in the following
kB = 1. Temperature is henceforth measured in energy
units. 1◦ Kelvin corresponds roughly to 10−4 eV. Denot-
ing the dimension of mass, length and time by M , L and
t, respectively, the dimension of m, c, a, T and p are M ,
Lt−1, L, M L2t−2 and M L2−dt−2, respectively. For both
cases ν = 1, 2 dimensional analysis gives

T ln v. Clearly v
as expected. This suggest f (T, v)
should occur in the free energy in combination with an-
other volume to make the argument of the logarithm
dimensionless. This shows the limitations of classical
physics. There is no dependence on m or c as long as
we use (1.1) for ν = 1, 2 separately, but clearly, both
together set a new energy scale mc2.

In the quantum case the Planck constant of action ~
appears as a new parameter. The thermal equation of
state will then depend on yet another dimensionsless pa-
rameter x which includes ~ as well as T , a and c or m.

where λT,ν denotes the thermal de Broglie wave length
for relativistic (ν = 1) and for non-relativistic (ν = 2)
particles, respectively. λC is the Compton wave length.
We ignore all numerical pre-factors since they are beyond
the accuracy of the dimensional analysis presented here.

For charged particles there is a further length scale, the
Bohr radius aBohr. If we consider for simplicity electrons
and demand overall neutrality, also positively charged nu-
clei have to be taken into account. The electron-nucleus
interaction is of the order e2/a. To have still an ideal gas
this energy has to be much smaller than the kinetic en-
ergy of the electrons. For non-relativistic electrons this

The diﬀerent regions of the parameter space can be
visualized in the diagram depicted in Figure 1 where we
plot T a/~c = a/λT,1 versus mca/~ = a/λC . Massless
particles like photons, phonons, magnons in antiferro-
magnets (all bosons) appear on the vertical axis. Since
their number N and hence the inter-particle distance a is
not ﬁxed (their chemical potential µ vanishes), the only
λT,1 (see also the discussion be-
possible choice is a
low). Thus massless bosons live on the vertical axis at

FIG. 1: Various cross-over lines in the T a/~c versus mca/~

137 (!) on the horizontal axis. Matter under ordinary con-
ditions (T ≪ mc2) is located in a narrow sector close to the
horizontal axis. Massless particles occupy the vertical axis
with a ∼ λT,1. Thus most parts of this diagram correspond
to exotic states.

The bisecting line λC = λT,ν (ν = 1, 2) corresponds to
T = mc2. In the region T

pairs will be created and hence the inter-particle distance
a is also no longer ﬁxed (it will be reduced). For electrons
this corresponds to temperatures T > 1010 K. At such
temperatures the constituents are no longer neutral and
photons are emitted, i.e. we have a mixture of matter
and radiation. We come back to this point further below
in this paper. Ordinary massive matter at temperatures
realized on earth is restricted to a narrow sector close to
the horizontal axis. For electrons me c2

The two lines a = λT,ν for ν = 1, 2 separate the clas-
sical region a > λT,ν from the quantum region a < λT,ν
for relativistic and non-relativistic particles, respectively.
Finally, there is a further line a = λC . For a < λC the
rest energy mc2 of the particle is smaller than its kinetic
energy ~c/a (for relativistic particles) or ~2/(ma2) (for
non-relativistic particles) resulting from the Heisenberg
uncertainty relation. This eﬀect is however only relevant
for fermions since bosons can come arbitrarily close. For

of weak quantum ﬂuctuations. Assuming that the pres-
sure can be expanded in powers of the particle density

expansion) ψ(x) can be written in the form

(3.8)

Here the plus and minus sign corresponds to fermions and
bosons, respectively. Indeed the Pauli principle will lead
to an increase of the pressure for fermions with respect
to the classical case. For bosons the pressure is reduced
since quantum mechanics increases the probability for
the double occupancy of a state2. (2.4), (3.7) and (3.8)
describe indeed the lowest order quantum correction to
the classical equation of state3.

B. Strong quantum limit - fermions

In the strong quantum limit x

0, we have to dis-
tinguish between fermions and bosons. For fermions the
Pauli-principle guarantees a non-zero pressure even for
x−ν

FIG. 2: Cross-over diagram of ideal Fermi gases. The line
T = EF which separates the classical from the quantum region
is depicted by the horizontal dashed line (T = EF,1) followed
by the dashed double dotted line (T = EF,2). The vertical

relativistic quantum behavior. The dashed single dotted line

EF,2 but
a > λC , to enter eventually the region of relativistic
quantum theory where T <

EF,1 and a < λC .

For very dense systems of atoms, where nuclei and
electrons form a plasma with a
aBohr, electrons and
protons may recombine to produce a neutron and a neu-
trino (the inverse β-decay). The charge of the resulting
nucleus is then reduced by one. In this case the electron
density a−d is no longer an independent variable but de-
termined by the chemical potential ˜µ of this process.

≪

Let us ﬁrst consider the case ˜µ > T . The dimensionfull

quantity ˜µ determines indeed a new length scale

which replaces a (for λT,1 > λµ > a) in eq.(3.11), i.e. the
pressure is reduced to6

λµ =

(3.12)

(3.13)

The maximal chemical potential of particles of mass
m is of the order mc2 and hence the minimal value of
λµ is of the order λµ,min . ~/(mc) = λC . Thus, for
a < λµ,min, a has to be replaced by λµ,min and hence the
minimum value of a/λC on the horizontal axis of Figure
2 is given by λµ,min/λC . 1. For smaller values of a, the
kinetic energy is much larger than mc2 and hence the
particle density is controlled by particle-antiparticle pair
production and annihilation. However, under realistic
conditions the temperature cannot be kept much lower
than the kinetic energy, i.e. T & ~c/a, from which we

3

conclude that the realistic lower bound for a is given by
mc2, the
λT,1. In this region, as well as in the region T
eﬀective chemical potential for particle-antiparticle pairs
is negligible and the only remaining length scale is λT,1,
which determines the particle distance. The pressure of
the Fermi gas in the asymptotic regions λC & a and
T & mc2 is therefore given by7

C. Strong quantum limit - bosons

For bosons the low temperature pressure does not de-
pend on the volume since all bosons may condense in the

As long as λT,1 > λC , i.e. T < mc2, the particles behave
non-relativistically. In the opposite case the temperature
T is larger than the rest energy of the particles and they
behave relativistically. The dimensions-less parameter
x can be written as x
T /Tc(a) where Tc(a) denotes
the temperature of Bose condensation. The pressure of
massive bosons in the region x
Tc(a),
obeys the classical law, eq. (2.3). In the opposite limit

etc., just photons and diluted massive particles. To make
things even simpler the only particles assumed to exist
are electrons and protons, which form hydrogen atoms ( a
”non-metallic” universe in the language of astronomers).
Initially the photon spectrum is assumed to correspond
to black body radiation of about 3 K. Since for massless
particles λT,1 is the only existing length scale, the typical

be represented in Figure 3. Photons occupy the vertical

Next we switch on the cosmic contraction, i.e. we go
backwards in time. It is convenient to introduce the con-
traction factor r(t) = a(t)

notes the distance at an earlier time t < tf when the

even smaller distance the Fermi gas behaves again essen-
tially like an ideal gas. Via the inverse β-decay electrons
and protons transform into neutrons and neutrino and
vice versa. Thus, the mean distance of leptons decreases
more strongly than the contraction parameter and the
particle reach the real of quantum theory. When temper-
atures reach the rest energy of the electrons, i.e. cross-
ing the bisecting line T = mec2 of Figure 2, the elec-

electron-positron pairs are formed and leptons behave
ultra-relativistically. Their mean distance is essentially

of all fundamental fermions reach the same position in

interaction) in Figure 3 , i.e. they occupy the vertical

are not new, but I have never encountered this formulation
elsewhere.
2 Considering the partition of two particles on two states
|xi, |yi of equal energy, classically there are 4 possibilities,
|xi|xi, |yi|yi, |xi|yi and |yi|xi. The probability that two
particles are in the same state, say |xi, is 1/4. In quantum
mechanics only the states |xi|xi, |yi|yi and 1

exist, i.e. the probability for having two particles in
the same state is 1/3.

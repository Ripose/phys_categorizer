Abstract

A heuristic but pedagogical derivation is given of an explicit for-
mula which accurately reproduces the period of a simple pendulum
even for large amplitudes. The formula is compared with others in
the literature.

1 Introduction

The dynamics of a simple pendulum for small amplitudes is probably the
most widely used example by educators to illustrate simple harmonic motion:
Both the experiment and theory are accesible to college students. However
the discussion of the large amplitude oscillations is rarely carried out, prob-
ably because there is no “simple” analytical formula for the period. Over
the years several approximation schemes have been developed to discuss the
large angle oscillations and in this paper we provide yet another. It turns
out that the formula derived here, which is quite accurate even for very large
amplitudes, was obtained a long time ago by Ganley [1] using a very diﬀer-
ent method. However, while the ﬁnal result is the same, the derivation here
is probably simpler and also directly linked to the usual derivation for the

linearised pendulum. Indeed, the interested reader could potentially use the
presentation here as the starting point for a systematic improvement of the
formula. Furthermore, an important diﬀerence between the result of Ganley
and that obtained in this paper is mentioned at the end of the next section.

2 Approximation Scheme

The equation of motion for the simple pendulum can be derived by applying
Newton’s Second Law to motion along the tangential direction of the arc,
giving

¨θ +

g
l

sin θ = 0 ,

where l is the length of the pendulum, g the acceleration due to gravity and
θ the angular displacemnent. The usual linearised approximation involves
replacing sin θ by θ. Let g/l = ω2
0, so that the period, T0, of a linear pendulum
is T0 = 2π(ω2
ω0 , which up to a constant of proportionality is the
0)−
unique expression obtained by dimensional analysis. Indeed, by dimensional
analysis the period of the non-linear pendulum must be of the form

1/2 = 2π

Ta = T0 f (α) ,

where α is the amplitude of oscillations and f (α) a function to be determined.
An approximate expression for f (α) can be obtained by ﬁrst rewriting the
equation of motion in the suggestive form

¨θ + ω2
0

sin(θ)

 

θ !

θ = 0 .

If one could treat the term in brackets as a constant, as it approximately
is for small angles, then an attempted estimate of the period of the non-linear
pendulum would be Ta ≈ 2π
. Of course this formula does not
make much sense as it stands since the period cannot depend on the angular
(cid:17)
displacement: The varying θ should be replaced by some ”average” value β
that depends on the amplitude α. Thus we obtain

The quality of this approximation can be determined by comparing it to the
exact value [2] given by

where

is the complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind. The two expressions Ta1/T0
and Tex/T0 are plotted in Figure(1) which shows that the approximation Ta1
gives an accuracy of 1% for amplitudes as large as α ≈ 2.25 radians.
It
should be noted that the approximation always lies below the exact answer,
but unlike the exact answer it does not diverge at α = π.

While the same formula for the ratio Ta1/T0 was obtained by Ganley in
an interesting paper [1] using diﬀerent methods, the approach presented here
gives Ta1 explicitly and consequently in the limit of small angles the known
expression T0 is also recovered.

3 Comparison with Other Approximations

Perturbative solutions for f (α) are known (or can be obtained by expansing
the right-hand-side of (7)). From the symmetry of the problem, one sees that
only even powers of α can appear. A natural question is: “How many terms
of the series expansion must be kept to get a 1% accuracy in the period for
an amplitude α ≈ 2.25?” (that is, to compare with the approximate formula

3

q

of the last section). A simple numerical exercise shows that all terms up to
and including the eighth-order term must be taken into account.

In a recent paper Kidd and Fogg [3] motivated the approximation f (α) ≈
1/
cos(α/2) which provides a 1% accuracy in the period for α up to π/2.
Though the expression of Kidd and Fogg is accurate over a smaller range of
amplitudes than the expression Ta1, it shares one interesting feature with the
exact expression: A divergence at α = π. This suggests that one generalise
the method of the last section by trying an ansatz for f (α) that also diverges
at the extreme amplitude α = π. One simple possibility, suggested by the
form of Eq.(3) is

where γ is a positive constant to be determined. By comparing the ﬁrst
nontrivial terms of the power-series of both sides of the last equation, one
obtains γ = −3/8. The resulting expression

always exceeds the exact answer and has an accuracy of 1% for amplitudes
up to α ≈ 1.9 radians. Interestingly, the result Ta2 is precisely the expression
of Molina [4] but obtained there with a slightly diﬀerent motivation.

4 Conclusion

The approach presented in Sect.(2) may possibly be viewed as a kind of “adi-
abatic approximation” and perhaps improved on to give successively better
approximations. The main result (6) is relatively simple and accurate to very
large amplitudes. While the ratio Ta1
T0 was previously obtained in [1] using
diﬀerent arguments, here an explicit expression for Ta1 has been obtained.

We show how the Schr¨odinger Uncertainty Relation for a pair of observables can be deduced using
the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality plus successive applications of the commutation relation involving
the two observables. Our derivation diﬀers from the original one in the sense that we do not need
the expansion of the product of these two observables in a sum of symmetrical and anti-symmetrical
operators.

I.

INTRODUCTION

(A) operators:

In 1930 Erwin Schr¨odinger presented1,2 a lower bound
for the product of the dispersion of two non-commuting
observables. This lower bound,
from now on called
Schr¨odinger Uncertainty Relation (SUR), is more general
than the usual Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation (HUR)
taught in all Quantum Mechanics courses. In fact, HUR
is a particular case of SUR.

In this article we present an alternative derivation of
Schr¨odinger’s relation. Diﬀerent from the original one,
we do not make use of the expansion of the product
of two observables in a sum of symmetrical and anti-
symmetrical operators.

In Sec. II we review in a modern notation Schr¨odin-
ger’s derivation and in Sec. III we present the new one.

II. SCHR ¨ODINGER’S DERIVATION

Let X and P be our two non-commuting observables:
= 0. Now we deﬁne the following

the mean values of X and P for a system described by
the normalized state

tors (observables) we know that [X, P ] = iC, where C
is Hermitian and i = √

written as,

III. AN ALTERNATIVE DERIVATION

We now present a new way of deriving Eqs. (9) and (12)
without employing Eqs. (6) and (7), while maintaining
the same simplicity of the previous derivation. The key
idea behind the following deduction lies on the convenient
use of the commutator of X and P .

Now we make use of Schr¨odinger’s ingenuity and write
XP as a sum of symmetrical (S) and anti-symmetrical

Again, we begin with the simplest situation,

e.
= 0 and, as before, our starting point is

Eq. (5). Remembering the deﬁnition of the commutator
of X and P we can write XP and P X as

To ﬁnish the proof we add Eqs. (5), (15), (16), and (17):

XP = P X + [X, P ],
[X, P ].
P X = XP

Finally, using simultaneously Eqs. (13) and (14) in

If

we get SUR given by Eq. (12) if we repeat the previous
procedure using Eqs. (10) and (11). (cid:3)

Abstract. The fact that the Dirac equation is linear in the space and time derivatives
leads to the coupling of spin and orbital angular momenta that is of a pure relativistic
nature. We illustrate this fact by computing the solutions of the Dirac equation in an
inﬁnite spherical well, which allows to go from the relativistic to the non-relativistic
limit by just varying the radius of the well.

The eﬀect of spin-orbit coupling is well known from elementary quantum mechanics and
atomic physics: it arises from the interaction between the spin of an electron in an atom
and the magnetic ﬁeld created by the orbiting nucleus in the rest frame of the electron.
This magnetic ﬁeld is related to the electric ﬁeld created by the nucleus in its rest frame.
If this ﬁeld is a spherical electrostatic ﬁeld, the interaction hamiltonian is given by

(1)

Here, as usual, ~S and ~L are the spin and orbital momentum operators for the electron,
m and e stand for the electron charge and mass, c is the speed of light in the vacuum
and V (r) is the electrostatic potential of the atomic nucleus. For one-electron atom,
the formula (1) is exact, otherwise V (r) can be thought as an approximation to an
average radial potential experienced by the electron. Equation (1) is obtained in the
non-relativistic limit (electron velocity is small compared to c — see, for instance, [1])
and so it is used in the non-relativistic description of an electron, i.e., by adding it to
the Hamiltonian in the Schr¨odinger equation.

In this paper we propose to examine a similar coupling that arises due to the
relativistic treatment of the electron (i.e. using the Dirac equation) even in the absence
of an external ﬁeld. This is a consequence of the linearity of the Dirac equation in
the space derivatives (and thus in the linear momentum operator ~p) and from the
related fact that one needs a 4-component spinor to describe the electron. We will
make the relativistic nature of this coupling apparent by solving the Dirac equation

in an inﬁnite spherical potential well. Although the particle motion inside the well is
free, the relativistic L
S coupling exists and vanishes only in the non-relativistic limit,
which we are able to approach continuously by varying the well radius. In this limit the
two-component spinor description is valid.

−

A comparison between relativistic and non-relativistic solutions was already studied
in [2] for a one-dimensional inﬁnite square well potential. In the present paper we use
the same procedures as in [2] to provide a bridge between known relativistic and non-
relativistic solutions in the 3-dimensional spherical case, with special emphasis on the
S coupling. Berry and Mondragon [3] have also applied similar methods in the
L
framework of the Dirac equation in two spatial dimensions.

−

In section 2 we pedagogically review the solutions of the free Dirac equation
in a slightly diﬀerent fashion from the usual treatments,
with spherical symmetry,
emphasizing the role of the L
S coupling term and its consequences for the set of
quantum numbers of the solution. In section 3 we solve the Dirac equation for a spherical
potential well and compare it to the non-relativistic solution of the corresponding
Schr¨odinger equation for several well radii. Technical details, included for completeness,
are mostly left to Appendices.

From the block oﬀ-diagonal form of the αi matrices one sees that the term ~α
~p mixes
the spinors χ′ and ϕ′. In the literature (see, for instance, Bjorken and Drell [4]) this
kind of term is referred to as “odd” as opposed to the terms like βmc2 which are called
“even”, since they don’t mix upper and lower two-component spinors. This distinction
is important when one goes to the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation using
the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation [4, 5] which aims at eliminating the odd terms
through a unitary transformation and so decouple the upper and lower spinors. In this
way one can regain the (Pauli) non-relativistic description of a spin- 1
2 particle. The fact
S coupling is odd indicates that this relativistic
that the term responsible for the L
eﬀect is related to the four-component spinor structure, i.e., to the existence of two
non-zero spinor components χ′ and ϕ′ of the wave function. This will be shown in the
following.

mass). This is done by the replacements E

3. Solution of the Dirac equation in an inﬁnite spherical well

In order to show numerically the relativistic nature of the L
S coupling described
in the preceding section, we are going now to compute the positive energy solutions
of the Dirac equation for an inﬁnite spherical well. As we will show, we can go, in a
natural way, from a relativistic to a non-relativistic situation by changing the radius of
the potential. The boundary conditions at the wall of the potential provide a discrete
energy spectrum which allows a clear picture of the non-relativistic limit.

−

To solve the Dirac equation in such a potential, one has to avoid any complications
due to the negative energy states when trying to localize a spin- 1
2 particle within a
distance of the order of its Compton wavelength ¯h/(mc) or less (this is the case for
conﬁned relativistic particles), one example of which is the Klein paradox (see, for
instance, [4]). In other words, we want to retain the rˆole of the Dirac equation as a one-
particle equation in the presence of a inﬁnite external potential. This is accomplished
by deﬁning a Lorentz scalar potential, i.e., a mass-like potential, having the form

m(r) =

m




∞

r < R

r > R

,

(18)



where m is the mass of the particle. The eﬀect of this potential is to prevent the
particle from propagating outside the well, meaning that its wave function is identically
zero there. Inside, it behaves as a free particle of mass m. A potential like (18), usually
with m = 0, has been used to describe conﬁned quarks as constituents of the nucleon
in the MIT bag model (see, e.g., [8] for a review of this and related models).

The boundary condition for the wave function at the boundary (r = R) cannot
be obtained by requiring its continuity, since, being the Dirac equation a ﬁrst-order

On the relativistic L

S coupling

−

diﬀerential equation, the potential (18) implies that there is an inﬁnite jump in the
derivative of Ψ (i.e., in the radial derivatives of G and F ) when the boundary of the
well is crossed. This jump obviously would not exist if Ψ were continuous. Another and
most natural alternative is to demand that the probability current ﬂux at the boundary
is zero. As it is shown in [3], this is also a necessary condition to assure the hermiticity
of the kinetic part of the Dirac hamiltonian within the well. This can be achieved by
the condition

i β~α

ˆrΨ = Ψ at

r = R.

−

·

In fact, if one multiplies this equation on the left by Ψ†β and its hermitian conjugate
on the right by βΨ one gets
ˆrΨ = Ψ†βΨ at r = R.
These two equations imply that Ψ†βΨ and Ψ†~α

i Ψ†~α
ˆrΨ are zero at r = R.

ˆrΨ = Ψ†βΨ and

The expression Ψ†~α

ˆrΨ can also be written as ~j

ˆr/c, where ~j = Ψ†~αΨc is the
probability current density for the particle described by the wave function Ψ. Instead
of the current ﬂux we can look at the value of Ψ†βΨ at the boundary: indeed, since Ψ
is zero for r > R, we may as well summarize the eﬀect of the boundary condition (19)
by saying that Ψ†βΨ is continuous for any value of r.

·

·

Having established the boundary condition, we proceed now to compute the radial

functions. This is done in Appendix C. The full spinor Ψ reads

non-relativistic results, using the notation n ℓ, are also presented. The non-relativistic
spectrum is obtained by solving the Schr¨odinger equation for a particle of mass m in an
inﬁnite spherical potential well of radius R = 100L0. The solutions can be found, for
instance, in the quantum mechanics textbook of Landau [10] (in this case, there is no

that going from a radius R = L0 to a radius R = 100L0 the L
S coupling eﬀect fades
away and j is no longer needed to classify the eigenstates of the system, and instead the
orbital momentum quantum number ℓ emerges as the relevant quantum number. Since
the boundary condition (22) eﬀectively imposes a (maximum) value for the wavelength
of the wave function and thereby a (minimum) value for the energy through the De
Broglie relation, increasing the radius of the well amounts to decreasing the energy until
we reach non-relativistic values for R = 100L0. Notice that for the higher levels, for this
value of R, even though there is not a perfect match with the non-relativistic energy
S coupling is a fact. The crucial scale here is the
values, the vanishing of the L
Compton wavelength L0 = ¯h/(mc), determining the relativistic nature of the solution
through the well radius.

−

In summary, we have showed numerically the relativistic nature of the L

S coupling
in the Dirac equation by computing its solutions for a particle with mass m in an inﬁnite
spherical potential well of radius R and making R suﬃciently big as to produce non-
relativistic solutions.

Appendix C.

In this Appendix we obtain the spinor which is the solution of the Dirac equation with
the inﬁnite spherical potential (18). To compute the radial functions Gjℓ and Fjℓ′ inside
the well, we ﬁrst look at equations (15) and (16) and make the change of variable

which are regular at the origin are the spherical Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind, jl(x)
(see, for instance, Abramowitz and Stegun [9]). Since these solutions are determined up
to an arbitrary multiplicative constant, the radial functions are

Gjℓ = A jℓ(x)
Fjℓ′ = B jℓ′(x) ,

Introduction

Several methods have been devised in order to solve electrostatic problems. Among them, the image
method stands out due to its relative simplicity and strong physical appeal. Essentially, the image
method leans on the uniqueness theorems of electrostatics which allow us, for instance, to replace a given
conductor by a system of charges capable of reproducing the boundary conditions on the surface of the
conductor. This replacement must be done outside the physical region so that Poisson equation remains
unchanged. It can be shown that it is always possible to obtain the set of auxiliary charges necessary
to solve the given electrostatic boundary problem [1]. The classical example of the application of this
method is the problem of a point charge at a distance D from a grounded perfectly conducting inﬁnite
plate . In this case, the image is another point charge with reversed algebraic sign at a distance D below
the mirror surface (the conducting plane). The electrostatic potential, and therefore the electric ﬁeld, in
the physical region is the sum of the potentials of the point charge and its image. From the knowledge of
the potential we can also calculate the distribuition of the electric charge induced on the plane. A more
challenging problem is the one of the point charge between two grounded conducting planes. The number
of images in this case is inﬁnite and they are distributed exactly as the specular images of a pointlike
light source placed between two parallel plane mirrors. For these two examples, the image method fully
deserves its name. Notice, however, that for most electrostatic boundary problems the images do not
correspond to those obtained in the framework of geometrical optics. For example, in the problem of a
point charge in the presence of a grounded perfectly conducting sphere, also a well known example of an
electrostatic problem, the latter does not work as mirror. Of course, this does not diminish the physical
appeal of the method.

In this paper we rediscuss and solve in detail another example of the collection of problems that can
be solved by the image method: The determination of the electric ﬁeld of an ideal static dipole with
an arbitrary spatial orientation in the presence of a grounded conducting sphere. A somewhat slightly
diﬀerent version of this problem is proposed in Batygin and Topygin’s problem book on electrodynamics
[2] where the student is asked to determine the system of images which is equivalent to the induced
charges, the interaction energy between the dipole and the sphere, and the force and torque on the
dipole. Only the answers are provided by those authors. The determination of the electrostatic potential
ﬁeld of a grounded sphere and an electric dipole for the particular case where the dipole is colinear with
the radius vector of the sphere was proposed in [3] and a brieﬂy sketched solution for the potential was
also oﬀered. To the electrical dipole pointing to an arbitrary spatial direction we also add a point charge.
This conﬁguration is suﬃciently general as to allow the consideration of several special situations that
can be compared with known results. As mentioned above, our aim here will be the enlargement of the
previous discussions mentioned above and in what follows, we will employ the image method to obtain
the potential, the electric ﬁeld and the induced surface charge on the conduction sphere. We will also
reobtain the electrostatic energy of the system as well as the force and torque on the dipole. We believe
that a complete discussion of this electrostatic problem can be useful for undergraduate and graduate
students as well as for their instructors. Also some variants of the problem can be proposed. We also
brieﬂy discuss some of these variants. S.I. units will be used.

2 The electrostatic problem and its solution

Let us begin by enunciating more precisely the problem we initially want to solve: Given a point charge
q and an arbitrarly oriented ideal dipole p, both placed at the same point of the space and at known
distance from a grounded, perfectly conducting sphere of radius R, the center of which coincides with the
origen of the coordinate system, ﬁnd the electric potential and ﬁeld at a point P in the region exterior

2

to the sphere, and ﬁnd also the induced surface charge density σe on the conducting sphere.

In order to solve this problem, it is convenient to start by recalling that for a point charge placed at a
distance R1 from the center of the sphere an image charge is formed at a distance R2 on the line joining
the centre of the sphere to the original point charge. These distances satisfy the geometrical relation

R1R2 = R

2

.

It seems natural then to place the image dipole at the same point below the spherical surface where the
image charge is located. With the convention that the indices 1 and 2 denote the real sources and their
images, respectively, the electrostatic potential at a point P exterior to the sphere is tentatively written
as

p2 · r2
4πǫ0r3
2
where r1 and r2 are position vectors linking the sources and their images to the observation point P ,
respectively. The relevant boundary condition is given by

Now we deﬁne new variables according to

R = r1 + R1,

R = r2 + R2,

r1

= k,

where R is the radius vector linking the origin to a point on the spherical surface and r1 and r2 are now
vectors linking the dipole and its image to this same point on the spherical surface. As in the problem of
a point charge in the presence of a conducting sphere, for points on the spherical surface the geometrical
relation

where ri ≡ krik, and k is a constant, holds, and we can rewrite Eq. (4) as

where we have also made use of Eqs. (5) and (6). Since this relation holds for an arbitrary point on the
conducting surface, i.e., for arbitrary R, we must have

We can solve this system for the unknown quantities q2 and p2 as functions of the known sources q1 and
p1 in a quick way by taking the dot product of the ﬁrst equation with R2. From the result we subtract
the second equation to obtain

Making use of the geometrical relation given by Eq. (1) (keep in mind that we are working on the surface
of the sphere) and noticing that R1 = R1 ˆR1 and R2 = R2 ˆR1, where ˆR1 is a ﬁxed unit radial vector
along the direction of R1, we can write Eq. (12) as

p1 · R1
k3R2 −
On the other hand, we can take advantage from the fact R is arbitrary and choose it in such a way that
R becomes parallel to R1 and R2 so that k can be easily calculated

where we have made use of Eq. (1). Then taking this result into Eq. (13) we ﬁnally obtain for the image
point charge the result

Equation (15) ﬁxes the image charge q2 completely. Remark that for the particular conﬁguration where
the dipole is perpendicular to its position vector relative to the centre of the sphere, R1, or when p1 = 0,
the image charge is the one of the problem of the grounded sphere and a point charge [1].

Taking Eq. (15) into Eq. (9), writing R2 = R2 ˆR1 and making use again of Eq. (1) to eliminate R2

we obtain

Equation (16) ﬁxes the direction and magnitude of the image dipole p2 completely. By making use of
the relation a × (b × c) = (a · c) b − (a · b) c, we can also write

The second term on the lhs of Eq. (induceddipole2) determines the transverse component of the image
dipole with respect to the position vector R1 of the real dipole.

From Eq. (16) we can easily show that the magnitude of the dipole and that of its image are related

by

it also easily seen that the angle between the direction determined by R1 and the image dipole is the
same as angle between this same direction and the real dipole. Therefore, the radial projection of image
dipole and that of the real dipole are positive and add up, see Figure 2.

Taking Eqs. (15) and (16) into Eq. (2) and recalling that r = r1 + R1 = r2 + R2, we obtain for the

electrostatic potential at an observation point P (r) not on the surface of the sphere the expression

The induced superﬁcial charge density on the sphere is given by σ = ǫ0 ˆR · E (R), therefore, the general
expression for the induced charge density is up to the constant ǫ0, the expression above with the unit
radial vector ˆR omitted.

3 The electric dipole in the presence of a grounded conducting

sphere

Let us consider the special conﬁguration formed by the electric dipole pointing at an arbitrary direction
and a grounded conducting sphere [2, 3]. To obtain the corresponding electrostatic potential, the electric
ﬁeld and the induced charge on the sphere we set q1 = 0 in the previous equations. Notice that in this
case, for an arbitrary direction, besides the image dipole p2, we have also, as remarked before, an image
charge q2 which depends on the relative orientation between p1 and R1. Only if p1 and R1 are mutually
perpendicular the image point charge will be zero and the image dipole will be scaled down by the factor
R3/R3

1 and its direction will be opposite to that of the real dipole.

In order to evaluate the electrostatic energy stored in this conﬁguration we must renormalise the
electric ﬁeld. This means to subtract from the total electric ﬁeld as given by Eq. (21) the contribution
of the real dipole, i.e., the ﬁrst two terms on the lhs of Eq. (21). Then the electrostatic energy can be
calculated from the formula

1In order to compare our results with those of Ref. [2] we must set R1 = R1ˆz, p1 = kp1k (sin α ˆx + cos α ˆz), where α is
the angle between R1 and p1. Then it is readily seen that both results agree. The same hold for the induced image charge
q2.

where we have deﬁned σ∗ (R) := 4πR3σ (R) /3kp1k, and B := R/R1; also ˆx · ˆR = sin θ cos φ, and
ˆz · ˆR = cos θ. The angles θ and φ are the usual polar and azimuthal angles associated with spherical
coordinates. Notice that 0 ≤ B ≤ 1. Also, for R1 ≫ R we have B → 0 and σ∗ (R) → 0, as it should.
Equation (31) will allow for simple plots of the dimensionless surface charge distribution as a function of
the polar angle once we have chosen α and φ. As an example we display in Fig. 3 the case in which we
set α = π/4 and φ = 0. More examples are shown in the subsequent Figs. 4, 5. Of course we can also
construct three-dimensional plots such as that of Fig. 6.

4 Final remarks

From the general solutions that we have found we can answer a number of particular questions, for
example, we now can readly answer to the question [4]: A point dipole of moment p is a distance d from
the center of a grounded conducting sphere and points to the center of it. What is the charge distribution
on the sphere? Or we can answer to the question: Does it matter if the sphere is isolated or grounded
[5]? For the grounded sphere the total charge is not speciﬁed and the amount of charge on it will depend
on the details of the conﬁguration. For an isolated charged sphere the total charge Q has a ﬁxed value
and the potential on the surface of the sphere has a value V0. In this case, an additional point charge
q3 placed at the center of the sphere will solve the problem. If the sphere is isolated but neutral, the
condition q3 + q2 = 0 must hold.

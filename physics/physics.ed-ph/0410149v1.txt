The nature of boundedness of orbits of a particle moving in a central force ﬁeld is investigated.
General conditions for circular orbits and their stability are discussed. In a bounded central ﬁeld
orbit, a particle moves clockwise or anticlockwise, depending on its angular momentum, and at the
same time oscillates between a minimum and a maximum radial distance, deﬁning an inner and an
outer annulus. There are generic orbits suggested in popular texts displaying the general features of
a central orbit. In this work it is demonstrated that some of these orbits, seemingly possible at the
ﬁrst glance, are not compatible with a central force ﬁeld. For power law forces, the general nature
of boundedness and geometric shape of orbits are investigated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

B. Newtonian Synthesis

The central force motion is one of the oldest and widely
studied problems in classical mechanics. Several familiar
force-laws in nature, e.g., Newton’s law of gravitation,
Coulomb’s law, van-der Waals force, Yukawa interaction,
and Hooke’s law are all examples of central forces. The
central force problem gives an opportunity to test one’s
understanding of the Lagrange’s equation, Hamilton’s
equation, Hamilton Jacobi method, and classical pertur-
bation. It also serves as an introduction to the concept of
integrals of motion and conservation laws. We need only
to appeal to the principles of conservation of energy and
angular momentum to describe the nature and geometry
of the possible trajectories in central force motion. Most
books in classical mechanics1,2,3,4,5,6, treatise7,8, and ad-
vanced texts9,10 discuss the central force problem. In this
article we present some interesting features of bounded
orbits in a central ﬁeld.

A. Kepler’s Laws

One of the most remarkable discoveries in the history of
physics is that of Keplerian orbits. A tremendous wealth
of data on planetary positions was collected by Tycho
Brahe and Johannes Kepler after detailed observation
spread over several decades. After a thorough analysis
of this data Johannes Kepler formulated three empirical
laws that described and correlated the motion of the ﬁve
planets then known:

1. Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the

sun at one of its foci.

2. The radius vector from the sun to each planet

sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

3. The square of the periods (T 2) of the planets are
proportional to the cube of the lengths of the cor-
responding semimajor axes (a3).

Almost 100 years later Newton realized that the plan-
ets go about in their nearly circular orbits around the sun
under the inﬂuence of the same force that causes an ap-
ple to fall to the ground, i.e., gravitation. Newton’s law
of gravitation gave a theoretical basis to Kepler’s laws.
Kepler’s laws can be derived from Newton’s law of grav-
itation; this is often referred to as the Newtonian syn-
thesis. Kepler’s ﬁrst and third laws are valid only in the
speciﬁc case of inverse square force. There are, however,
certain general features which are observed in all cen-
tral ﬁeld problems. They include (i) certain conserved
quantities (energy, and angular momentum), (ii) planer
nature of orbits, and (iii) constancy of areal velocity (Ke-
pler’s second law). A large class of central forces allows
circular orbits (stable or unstable), bounded orbits, and
even closed and periodic orbits. Certain common charac-
teristics about the generic shapes of bounded orbits can
also be ascertained.

II. EQUATIONS OF MOTION AND THEIR
FIRST INTEGRALS

A. Central ﬁeld orbits: conﬁnement in a plane

The central force motion between two bodies about
their center of mass can be reduced to an equivalent one
body problem in terms of their reduced mass m and their
relative radial distance r. Hence in this reduced system,
a body having the reduced mass moves about a ﬁxed
center of force.

Consider the motion of a body under a central force,
F = F(r) = f (r)ˆr with the origin as its force center. The
potential V (r) from which this force is derived is also a
function of r alone, F =

∇V, V
On account of the central nature of the force, the me-
chanical properties of the body do not vary under ro-
tation in any manner around the center of force. Let

V (r).

the body be rotated through an inﬁnitesimal angle δθ,
where the magnitude δθ is the angle of rotation while
the direction is that of the axis of rotation ˆn. The
change in the radius vector from the origin to the body
= rsin(θ)δθ, with δr being perpendicular to r
is
|
and δθ. Hence δr = δθ
r. The change in velocity is
×
similarly given by δv = δθ
v. The Lagrangian of the
×
system is a function of r and ˙r. The motion is governed
by the Lagrange’s equation,

As δθ is arbitrary we conclude l = r
p is a conserved
quantity. l is called the angular momentum of the sys-
tem. Since l is a constant and is perpendicular to r it
follows that the radius vector of the particle lies in a
plane perpendicular to l. This implies that the motion
of the particle in a central ﬁeld is conﬁned to a plane.

B. Lagrangian and equations of motion

As the motion in a central force ﬁeld is conﬁned to a
plane, it suﬃces to use plane polar coordinates. One may
write the Lagrangian of the particle as,

L =

V (r) =

We assume the center of force to be at the origin. The
coordinates of the body of mass m undergoing the central
ﬁeld motion are given by (r, θ).

C. First integrals and conservation laws

The canonical momentum corresponding to θ is called
the angular momentum (or rather the magnitude of the
angular momentum that we discussed before),

As θ is a cyclic coordinate, i.e., the Lagrangian is inde-
pendent of θ, this angular momentum is conserved. This
can be shown from the Lagrange’s equation for θ.

The corresponding integral of motion is,

mr2 ˙θ = l

(4)

and this l can easily be shown to be the magnitude of the
angular momentum vector l = r

p.

This conservation law is essentially equivalent to Ke-

×

pler’s 2nd Law:

The elementary triangular area swept by the radius

vector in an inﬁnitesimal time interval dt is,

dA =

hence it follows from Eq. (4) that the rate of areal sweep
is a constant.

tial. Total energy is 60% of the minimum of eﬀective potential

The force in terms of the potential (conservative force)
is given by, f (r) =
∂V /∂r, whence the above equation
becomes

mr ˙θ2 = f (r)

mr2 + V (r) = E

where E is a constant of integration, called the energy.
This is the law of conservation of total mechanical energy.
It is interesting to note that for motion in a general
force ﬁeld, l = mr2 ˙θ remains invariant even though r and
˙θ vary with time (see Fig. 2). Similarly E = m ˙r2/2 +
l2/(2mr2)+V (r) remains a constant even though ˙r and r
and hence m ˙r2/2 and V (r) + l2/(2mr2) each varies with
time (see Fig. 3).

Lagrange’s equations are two second order Ordinary
Diﬀerential Equations (ODE) in r and θ. However they
decouple, i.e., each equation is expressible in terms of ei-
ther r or θ. On integrating each equation once we get
the ﬁrst integrals of motion namely, the total mechanical
energy and the angular momentum. A further integra-
tion will yield the complete solution to the problem. This
second integration introduces two more constants of in-
tegration namely, the initial radial (r0) and angular (θ0)
positions.

motion, we get the expression for radial velocity,

These two expressions for r(t) and θ(t) express the equa-
tion of the orbit for the particle in a central ﬁeld in terms
of time t as a parameter.

Instead of expressing the orbit parametrically in terms
of t, one often wants to express the orbit directly as an
equation connecting r and θ. Such an equation may be
obtained by eliminating t from the above expressions for
˙r and ˙θ.

We call ˜V the eﬀective potential, introduced to make
the problem similar to that of a particle moving in a
one dimensional potential ﬁeld. The eﬀective radial force
( ˜f (r)) is connected to the eﬀective radial potential ( ˜V (r))
by the expected relation,

˜f (r) =

∂ ˜V (r)
∂r

(10)

−
At a point where the eﬀective potential ˜V (r) equals the
energy E, the radial velocity vanishes ( ˙r = 0). In one
dimensional motion this corresponds to a particle com-
ing momentarily to rest, and having zero kinetic energy.
However in the case of central ﬁeld, the motion is not
really one dimensional, and even for ˙r = 0, the particle
is not at rest (v = r ˙θˆθ), and it has a non-zero kinetic
energy ((1/2m)r2 ˙θ2).

For the inverse square force, as in the case of gravita-

3. ˜V (r) =

r, l2/2mr2 is negligible compared to k, hence ˜V (r)
has a negative value.

−

−

4. At r∗ = l2/2mk the function ˜V (r) intersects the r

axis, i.e., ˜V (r∗) = 0.

5. ˜V (r) reaches a minimum at r0 = 2

r∗ = l2/mk.

For total energy E = ˜V (r0) the particle has zero radial
velocity at r = r0, and no other radial position is phys-
ically accessible, since ˙r becomes imaginary at r
= r0.
This corresponds to circular motion.

For 0 > E > ˜V (r0) there is a range of radial positions
˜V (r). The particle can
(rmax
move in this range of r with varying ˙r. The radial velocity
˙r vanishes at the end points rmax and rmin where the
energy E equals the eﬀective potential ˜V and ˙r reaches a
maximum at r = r0 The points rmax and rmin are called
the turning points. The central ﬁeld particle cannot move
beyond these points, as the energy becomes less than the
eﬀective potential, and the expression for radial velocity
( ˙r) turns imaginary.

≥

For E

E < ˜V (r0) is a physically impossible situation, since
no (radial) position is physically allowed for the particle.
0 we have an unbounded motion, where the
particle can ﬂy oﬀ to inﬁnity. Thus in the case of inverse
square force ﬁeld we can have bounded (E < 0) or un-
bounded (E
0) motion depending on the energy of the
particle. In particular for E = 0 it is parabolic and for
E > 0 it is hyperbolic.

III. EXISTENCE AND STABILITY OF

At all positions other than where the eﬀective potential
is a minimum or a maximum, we have a net eﬀective force
˜f (r) =
= 0. When the total energy E is not
equal to the minimum of eﬀective potential ˜V (r), at the
points of instantaneous zero radial velocity the particle
is pushed away. If the eﬀective potential has a minimum
and energy is greater than that minimum then the radial
distance has a lower and an upper bound and the particle
moves between these radial limits. On the other hand if
the eﬀective potential has a maximum, and the energy is
less than that maximum, the eﬀective force pushes the

particle away from the positions of zero radial velocity
in an inward or an outward spiral. If the total energy
is equal to the maximum or minimum of the eﬀective
potential, the system can stay with zero radial velocity,
and hence move in a circular orbit.

The condition for circular orbit is,

The negative sign on the right hand side clearly shows
(cid:12)
that the force must be attractive. The particle moves in
a circular orbit, since the force of attraction due to the
central ﬁeld provides the necessary centripetal force.

For a given attractive central force ( f (r) and V (r)
given ) it is possible to have a circular orbit of radius
r0 provided the angular momentum and energy of the
particle are given by,

However when the eﬀective potential has a maximum
the system is in an unstable circular orbit. A small devi-
ation from this radial position causes the orbit to be un-
bounded. The eﬀective force that comes into play makes
the particle move away from the position of zero radial
velocity in an inward or outward spiral (Fig. 5). When

hence

5

the eﬀective potential has a minimum, the eﬀective forces
cause the particle to remain in a bound orbit conﬁned
in an annular space. For small deviations the annular
radii are nearly the same, and hence the orbit is close to
a circle. One can understand the stability question by
studying the forces (restoring or unsettling) that come
into play when the system is moved inﬁnitesimally from
the position of circular orbit.

The circular orbit is stable if,

∂2 ˜V

IV. NATURE OF BOUNDED ORBITS

General bounded motion has both lower and upper
bounds.
It means that the particle cannot approach
nearer than some minimum or move farther than some
maximum distance. One has to remember that the angu-
lar velocity has a constant sign, same as that of the con-
stant angular momentum, throughout the motion. How-
ever its magnitude decreases with increase in the radial
1/r2). Together with the angular motion, the
distance (
radial distance changes from rmax to a rmin, then back
to rmax and so on. From this general nature of motion
two families of generic orbits are suggested in popular
texts11 (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). However it can be shown that
the generic types shown in the later ﬁgure (Fig. 7) are
not feasible for any attractive potential.

∼

We consider below a general bounded orbit conﬁned in
an annular region. We would like to investigate the na-
ture of the orbit close to the point where it touches the
inner or the outer annulus. Let us choose the reference
line (polar line) of the coordinate system such that the
orbit touches the annular ring at θ = 0, or more speciﬁ-
cally at r = R, θ = 0. Since at this point P (r = R, θ = 0)
the orbit is at its closest (or farthest) approach from the
pole, (∂r/∂t)P = 0. As r is a function of θ, using Eq. (4)
we get for motion along the trajectory,

vature) will determine the nature of the trajectory in
reference to the tangent.

We ﬁrst study the curvature of the orbit in reference
to the tangent. The force being attractive f (r(0)) < 0,
for small angular distance (∆(θ)) away from the point P ,

r(∆θ)traj < r(0) = rmax

(20)

This conﬁrms that the outer annulus is indeed the outer
bound of the trajectory. The nature of the orbit near the
point of contact P at the outer annulus is shown in ﬁgure

tangent and stays closer to the inner annulus for nearby
points (Fig. 8). Hence the second type of orbits shown
in some texts (Fig. 7) are not possible for central forces.
For the outer annulus the analysis with respect to tan-
gent is not very meaningful as one can set up an even
stronger bound for its orbit, directly considering the po-
tential ˜V (r).
In this case the eﬀective potential has a
positive slope with respect to the radius, and hence a
negative eﬀective force ( ˜f (r) < 0). The orbit should not
only remain nearer than the tangent, but even nearer
than the outer annulus. This condition is conﬁrmed if

Hence the circular orbit is stable for an attractive power
law potential that varies slower than inverse square (or a
force that varies slower than inverse cube).

l2/(2m)), and a/rn−2 is negligible compared to
l2/(2m), and hence ˜V (r) is positive.

4. ˜V (r) intersects the r axis at r∗ where (r∗)n−2 =

2am/l2.

5. ˜V (r) has a maximum at r0 where rn−2

0 = anm/l2.
For a maximum point of ˜V we should have

Hence it is a point of maximum. For E > ˜V (r0) we
always have an unbounded orbit. For E < ˜V (r0) the
orbit is semibounded, bounded above or bounded below,
according to its initial state. The particle either spirals in
or spirals out. For E = ˜V (r0) we get an unstable circular
orbit.

2. V (r) = −a/rn where n = 2

l2/(2mr2). This is essentially an attractive or repulsive
inverse square term.

This potential cannot give circular orbit ever. If the ef-
fective potential is attractive and E < 0 it has an upper
bound of radial distance. A typical orbit would therefore
be an inward spiral. For a repulsive eﬀective potential
we will have outward spiral moving to inﬁnite radial dis-
tance.

3. V (r) = −a/rn where 2 > n > 0

In this case the eﬀective potential is,

some r = r0, and it has a negative slope for all r < r0,
and positive slope for all r > r0. For E = ˜V (r0) we get
stable circular orbit, and for ˜V (r0) < E < 0. the orbits
are still bounded. For cases (2) and (3) the circular orbit
is stable, and orbits are always bounded for any energy.

VI. CONCLUSION

Existence of bounded orbit for a large class of attrac-
tive central ﬁeld has been discussed. The generic nature
of central ﬁeld bounded orbits is analytically derived.
Certain class of these orbits (Fig. 7) presented in popular
texts1, are shown to be non-feasible.

Small deviation from circularity in the case of central
ﬁeld is often expressed in terms of inverse of radial dis-
tance (u = 1/r).

u = u0 + a

1 + a

where r0 = 1/u0.

It is interesting to note that these

11

orbits are sometime mistakenly identiﬁed with diagrams
of the form shown in Fig. 711. The above expression in
fact corresponds to a class of orbits that look generically
like those shown in Fig. 6.

The generic features of central force orbits discussed
here have been veriﬁed by computer simulation for a large
class of central force ﬁelds. The ﬁgures shown here (Fig.
2, 3, 5 and 6) were generated by these simulations. Stu-
dents interested in studying and generating such orbits
will ﬁnd Ref.12 helpful.

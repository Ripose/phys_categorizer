Abstract

In quantum ﬁeld theory, physicists routinely use “normal ordering” of operators,
which just amounts to shuﬄing all creation operators to the left. Potentially confus-
ing, then, is the occurrence in the literature of normal-ordered functions, sometimes
called “Wick transforms”. We aim to introduce the reader to some basic results and
ideas around this theme, if not the mathematical subtleties; our intended audience
are instructors who want to add something to their quantum ﬁeld theory course,
or researchers who are interested but not specialists in mathematical physics. For
rigorous proofs and careful mathematical discussions we only give references.

1 Introduction

Normal ordering was introduced in quantum ﬁeld theory by G.C. Wick in 1950, to avoid
some inﬁnities in the vacuum expectation values of ﬁeld operators expressed in terms of
creation and annihilation operators [1]. The simplest example of such inﬁnities can be
discussed based on non-relativistic quantum mechanics and the simple harmonic oscillator;
an inﬁnite number of harmonic oscillators make up a free quantum ﬁeld. (The reader who
needs a quick reminder of some basic quantum ﬁeld-theoretical concepts may ﬁnd comfort
in appendix A). We will use the harmonic oscillator to exhibit the connection between
Wick-ordered polynomials and the familiar Hermite polynomials. Then we turn to Wick
transforms in the functional integral formalism of ﬁeld theory, where we show that there
is again a connection with Hermite polynomials. Several diﬀerent approaches to Wick
transforms that can be found in the literature are compared and we show why they are
equivalent. In passing, we observe how the standard quantum ﬁeld theory result known as
“Wick’s theorem” follows rather directly in this framework, from well-known properties
of Hermite polynomials. Finally, we provide one brief example of how the Wick transform
can be utilized in a physical application.

2 Wick operator ordering

2.1 Simple Harmonic Oscillator

The Hamiltonian operator for the simple harmonic oscillator in non-relativistic quantum
mechanics has the form

H = 1

2 (P 2 + Q2) ,

where we have, as usual, hidden Planck’s constant ~, the mass m, and the angular fre-
quency ω in deﬁnitions of dimensionless momentum and position operators

P :=

√~mω

Q :=

[a, a†] = 1 ,

H = 1

2(P 2 + Q2) = 1

a†a + aa†

= a†a + 1

.

This means, as proved in introductory quantum mechanics books (see e.g. Sakurai [2]),
that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator come in the sequence

In particular, the ground state energy (or zero-point energy), which is the lowest eigenvalue
of the Hamiltonian, is non-zero:

This is in agreement with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle: It is the smallest energy
value that saturates the uncertainty relation (again, see e.g. Sakurai [2] for the explicit
calculation).

This zero-point energy has observable physical consequences; as an illustration, it is
possible to measure zero-point motion (which leads to the zero-point energy) of atoms in
a crystal by studying dispersion of light in the crystal. Classical theory predicts that any
oscillations of the atoms in the crystal, and therefore also dispersion eﬀects, cease to exist
when the temperature is lowered towards absolute zero. However, experiments demon-
strate that dispersion of light reaches a ﬁnite, non-zero value at very low temperature.

In quantum ﬁeld theory, a free scalar ﬁeld can be viewed as an inﬁnite collection of
harmonic oscillators, as described in appendix A. If we proceed as before, each oscillator
will give a contribution to the zero-point energy, resulting in an inﬁnite energy, which
seems like it could be a problem.

One way to remedy the situation is to deﬁne the ground state as a state of zero
energy. We can achieve this by redeﬁning the Hamiltonian: We subtract the contribution
of the ground state and deﬁne a so-called Wick-ordered (or normal-ordered) Hamiltonian,
denoted by putting a colon on each side, by

: H: = : 1

Hence, in this example the deﬁnition of Wick ordering can be thought of as a redeﬁnition
of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator.

(cid:1)

On the other hand, we also see that in the last equality in (5) all creation operators
end up on the left. A general prescription for Wick ordering in quantum ﬁeld theory in
a creation/annihilation operator formalism is then: “Permute all the a† and a, treating
them as if they commute, so that in the end all a† are to the left of all a.” The resulting
expression is, of course, the same:

: H: = a†a .

2.2 Wick ordering and Hermite polynomials

The ﬁrst connection between Wick ordering and Hermite polynomials arises if we study
powers of the (dimensionless) position operator Q. Physically, in the harmonic oscillator,
the eigenvalue of Q2 gives the variance (squared standard deviation) of the oscillator from
rest. We have Q = (a† + a)/√2, but to avoid cluttering the equations with factors of √2,
we will study powers of just (a† + a).

(a† + a)2 = a†2 + a†a + aa† + a2

= a†2 + 2a†a + a2 + [a, a†]
= : (a† + a)2: + [a, a†]
= : (a† + a)2: + 1

by (5).

Arranging terms in a similar way for higher powers of (a† + a) we ﬁnd

(a† + a)3 = : (a† + a)3 : + 3(a† + a) .
(a† + a)4 = : (a† + a)4 : + 6 : (a† + a)2 : + 3 .

We can summarize the results as follows, with the notation a† + a = q,

q2 = : q2: + 1 ,
q3 = : q3: + 3: q: ,
q4 = : q4: + 6: q2: + 3 .

: q2 : = q2
: q3 : = q3
: q4 : = q4

−

= He2(q) ,

3q
= He3(q) ,
6q2 + 3 = He4(q) ,

Since we can recursively replace normal-ordered terms on the right by expressions on the
left which are not normal-ordered (e.g. : q2: can be replaced by q2
1), we can also invert
these relations:

−

where the polynomials Hen(q) are a scaled version of the more familiar form of the Hermite
polynomials Hn:

Hen(x) = 2−n/2Hn(x/√2).

Confusingly, in some mathematical physics literature, the Hen are often just called Hn.
Some of the many useful properties are collected in appendix B for easy reference (a more
complete collection is given in e.g. Abramowitz & Stegun [3]).

Because of this relation between operator Wick-ordering and Hermite polynomials, the
mathematical physics literature sometimes deﬁnes “Wick ordering” in terms of Hermite
polynomials:

(6)

(7)

: qn: def= Hen(q) .

4

Although q is an operator composed of noncommuting operators a and a†, this alterna-
tive deﬁnition naturally generalizes to Wick-ordering of functions. As promised, we will
explore this idea in the next section.

One reason that the connection to Hermite polynomials is not mentioned in standard
quantum ﬁeld theory literature is the fact (which was also Wick’s motivation) that the
normal-ordered part is precisely the part that will vanish when one takes the vacuum
expectation value. Indeed, the traditional way to deﬁne normal ordering, the one given
at the end of section 2.1 (“put a† to the left of a”), yields for powers of q simply

n

i

i=1 (cid:18)
X

(cid:19)

(a†)n−iai,

which vanishes for any nonzero power n when applied to the vacuum state

0

.

i

|

In other words, since one knows that normal ordered terms vanish upon taking the

vacuum expectation value, one may not be interested in their precise form.

However, when the expectation value is not taken in the vacuum (for example, in a
particle-scattering experiment), this part does of course not vanish in general, and there
are in fact many instances where the actual normal-ordered expression itself is the one of
interest.

3 Functional integrals and the Wick transform

Most modern courses on quantum ﬁeld theory discuss functional integrals (sometimes
called “path” integrals, however only in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics does one re-
ally integrate over paths). In a functional-integral setting, the counterpart of the Wick
ordering in the operator formalism is the Wick transform. This transform applies to func-
tions and functionals. It can, like its quantum-mechanics counterpart eq. (7), be deﬁned
by means of Hermite polynomials. But ﬁrst, let us brieﬂy skip ahead and explain why
such a transform will prove to be useful.

3.1

Integration over products of ﬁelds

In the functional formalism, physical quantities like scattering cross sections and decay
constants are computed by integrating over some polynomial in the ﬁelds and their deriva-
tives. The algorithmic craft of such computations is described in textbooks such as Ryder
[9] and Peskin & Schroeder [5]. Even though there are examples of physical eﬀects that
can be studied with functional-integral methods but not with ordinary canonical quanti-

5

zation1, within the scope of this paper we can only give examples of some things that can
be derived more quickly or transparently using functional integrals.

In fact, we will also be concerned with some rather basic questions that are usually
glossed over in introductory treatments: what does the functional integral itself really
mean? While a complete answer is not even known, and certainly beyond the scope of
this short article, we intend to give some ﬂavor of the ﬁrst steps towards addressing this
question and how the Wick transform has been put to work in this regard.

First, a restriction: the polynomials considered in this section are polynomials of Eu-
clidean ﬁelds (ﬁelds deﬁned on four-dimensional Euclidean space R4). Similar formalisms
exist for Minkowski ﬁelds (ﬁelds deﬁned on spacetime) with minor changes in the equa-
tions (see e.g. the aforementioned textbook [5]). Unfortunately, functional integrals over
Minkowski ﬁelds are less mathematically developed than integrals over Euclidean ﬁelds,
therefore we shall restrict attention to Wick transforms of functions and functionals of
Euclidean ﬁelds — primarily polynomials and exponentials. The Wick transform, like the
Hermite polynomials, has orthogonality properties that turn out to be useful in quantum
ﬁeld theory, as we shall see. First, we have to introduce a few mathematical concepts.

3.1.1 Gaussian measures

Here, our aim is to ﬁx the notation, and to brieﬂy remind the reader how to integrate
over Euclidean ﬁelds, without going into too much detail. The standard mathematical
framework to perform such integration is the theory of Gaussian measures in Euclidean
ﬁeld theory, for which details can be found in the mathematical physics literature, such
as Glimm & Jaﬀe [6] and Janson [7].

As a ﬁrst try, one would deﬁne a ﬁeld in the functional integral as a function φ on R4.
Fields in the functional integral, however, may seem like functions at ﬁrst glance, but can
produce divergences that cannot (for instance) be multiplied in the way that functions
can. A more useful way to regard a quantum ﬁeld in the functional integral formalism is
as a distribution Φ acting on a space of test functions f :

Φ(f ) def=

Φ, f

,

i

h

(8)

denotes duality, i.e. Φ is such that it yields a number when
where the bracket
applied to a smooth test function f . In many situations the distribution Φ is equivalent

i

h

,

1In particular, contributions to the S-matrix that have an essential singularity at zero coupling con-
stant cannot be found by standard perturbative expansion around zero coupling, yet these “nonpertur-
bative” contributions can be studied using functional integrals. Rates for decays that would be strictly
forbidden without these eﬀects can be computed, see for example the book by Ryder [9, Ch. 10.5].

(9)

A familiar example of a distribution is the one-dimensional Dirac distribution Φ = δ, for
which we have

Φ(f ) =

δ, f

= f (0) .

h

i

Now, just like a function, Φ in general belongs to an inﬁnite-dimensional space. To
be able to integrate over this space (not to be confused with the integral in equation (9),
which is an ordinary integral over spacetime) we need a measure, some generalization of
the familiar dx in the ordinary integral above. Here, a useful generalization will actually
depend on the Green’s function, called covariance in this context and denoted C.
In
general, the covariance is a positive, continuous, non-degenerate bilinear form on the space
of test functions. In the following, we will often encounter the covariance at coincident
test functions, here denoted C(f, f ).

To get to the point, a Gaussian measure dµC is deﬁned by its covariance C as

but going back from dµC to an explicit separation as on the left will not turn out to be
necessary for our discussion. In fact, by deﬁning the measure dµC through eq. (10), we
have not even speciﬁed what such a separation would mean.

With the above expressions in mind, the covariance at incident points is expressed as

the following integral, obtained by expanding eq. (10):

3.1.2 Wick transforms, deﬁnitions

The goal here is to provide some idea of how to address the diﬃcult mathematical problem
of making sense out of products of distributions, and integrals of such products, which
(as argued above) are ubiquitous in quantum ﬁeld theory, although their exact meaning is
not usually discussed in standard introductory textbooks. In order to simplify quantum
ﬁeld theory calculations, one deﬁnes the Wick transform of a power Φ(f )n :=
so

as to satisfy an orthogonality property with respect to Gaussian integration. Recalling
the orthogonality properties of Hermite polynomials (appendix B) and the deﬁnition (7)
a simple idea is to deﬁne the Wick transform in terms of Hermite polynomials:

: Φ(f )n:C = C(f, f )n/2Hen

(17)

Φ(f )
C(f, f )!

.

 

p

Notice that this depends on the covariance C, and that there is no analogous dependence
in the analogous harmonic-oscillator deﬁnition (7).

The orthogonality of two Wick-transformed polynomials is then expressed by

dµC(Φ) : Φ(f )n:C : Φ(g)m:C = δm,n n! (

Φ(f ) Φ(g)

h

iµC )n.

(18)

Z

An entertaining exercise is to show this, which we will do in section 3.1.3 (paragraph 2).

The Wick transform can also be deﬁned recursively by the following equations [4]

Let us check that the Wick transform : Φ(f )n:C deﬁned by eq. (19) is the same as the
Wick transform given in terms of Hermite polynomials in eq. (17). This is of course to be
expected, since Hermite polynomials themselves satisfy similar recursion relations, but it
is a useful exercise to check that it works. To begin with, we establish a property of Wick
exponentials.

Let : exp(αΦ(f )):C be the formal series

3.1.3 Wick transforms, properties

Many properties of Wick ordered polynomials can be conveniently derived using the formal
exponential series. For simplicity, we assume that all physical quantities that one may
wish to compute (scattering cross sections, etc.) are written with normalization factors of
1/C(f, g), which in eﬀect lets us set the coincendent-point covariance to unity: C(f, f ) =
1. It can be restored by comparison with eq. (23). The properties we are interested in
are useful exercises to show:

1. Show that

second factor, again in the second line. Dividing both sides of the equation by the
second factor completes the demonstration.

2. Show that

3. Show that

Solution:
This is a consequence of the equivalence of Wick ordered functions and Hermite
polynomials. The expression follows from the recursion relation for Hermite poly-
nomials given in appendix B.

4. The deﬁnition of Wick transforms given above can be generalized to several ﬁelds in
a very straightforward manner. We quote here some results without proof (details
can be found in e.g. the book by Simon [4]). The reader may ﬁnd it interesting to
check that it works:

: Φ(f1) . . . Φ(fn+1): = : Φ(f1) . . . Φ(fn): Φ(fn+1)

Z

These latter multi-ﬁeld expressions reproduce, within this functional framework, what
is usually referred to as “Wick’s theorem” in the creation/annihilation-operator formalism.
In that formalism, it takes some eﬀort to show this theorem; here we ﬁnd it somewhat
easier, relying on familiar properties of the Hermite polynomials.

3.2 Wick transforms and functional Laplacians

3.2.1 Deﬁnition

We can also deﬁne Wick transforms of functions by the following exponential operator
expression, which is convenient in many cases (e.g.
in two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld
theory settings, such as in references [8] and [12]):

: φn(x):C

which, again, depends on the covariance C.

alence of deﬁnition (24) and deﬁnition (17) in the common example of a φ4 power, when

3.3 Further reading

Although we hope to have given some ﬂavor of some of the techniques and ideas of quan-
tum ﬁeld theory mathematical-physics style, we have of course really only given a few
illustrative examples and demonstrated some simple identities. For more on the math-
ematical connection between Wick transforms on function spaces and Wick ordering of
annihilation and creation operators, we recommend textbooks such as [6] and [7].

3.4 An application: speciﬁc heat

In this last section, we discuss one example of a physical application of some of the
results above. By using the connection (17) between the Wick transform and Hermite
polynomials, we show how one can exploit standard properties of those polynomials to
simplify certain calculations.

Consider the familiar generating function of Hermite polynomials (but for the scaled

polynomials (6)):

exα−α2/2 =

Hen(x) αn/n!

.

(26)

X

This generating function gives a shortcut to computing some quantum eﬀects in two-
dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory, where normal orderering is often the only form of
renormalization necessary. An important issue is the scaling dimension of the normal-
ordered exponential : eipφ: , where p is a momentum. (The real part of this operator can
represent the energy of a system where φ is the quantum ﬁeld.).
In other words, the
Λ−1x in
question is: if we rescale our momentum p
→
coordinate space, how does this operator scale? Since an exponential is normally expected
to be dimensionless, one might guess that the answer is that it does not scale at all, i.e.
that the scaling dimension is zero. In fact, this is not so due to quantum eﬀects induced
by the normal ordering. Passing to the functional integral, we can easily compute the
eﬀect of the normal ordering (here, the Wick transform):

where we used the deﬁnition (17) and the previously given generating function (26). Now,
the covariance (Green’s function) C is a logarithm in two dimensions, i.e. the solution
of the two-dimensional Laplace equation is a logarithm. To regulate divergences when

14

, one introduces a cutoﬀ Λ on the momentum, which makes C = ln Λ. Substituting

p
this into (27) yields the answer

→ ∞

: eipφ: = Λp2/2eipφ .

(28)

Thus, the anomalous scaling dimension, usually denoted by γ, is γ = p2/2 for the expo-
nential operator. This is an important basic result in conformal ﬁeld theory (see e.g. [11],
p. 451). Here, the p2/2 just comes from the α2/2 in the generating function (26)!

How could such a quantum eﬀect be measured? Consider the ”two-dimensional Ising
model with random bonds” (p. 719, [12]). This is just the familiar Ising model, but
one allows the coupling between spins to ﬂuctuate, i.e. the coupling becomes a space-
dependent Euclidean ﬁeld in the spirit of previous sections. The energy of the system
is described by (the real part of) an exponential operator : eipφ: as stated above. Using
renormalization group methods, the anomalous dimension (28) leads to a formula for the
speciﬁc heat in this system (eq. (356) in [12], where the derivation is also given). The
speciﬁc heat is in principle directly measurable as a function of the temperature, or more
conveniently, as a function of θ = (T
Tc)/Tc, the dimensionless deviation from the critical
temperature. The renormalization group description predicts a certain double logarithm
dependence on θ that could not have been found by simple perturbation theory, and it
uses as input the result (28).

−

Admittedly, the telegraphic description in the previous paragraph does not do justice
to the full calculation of the speciﬁc heat in the two-dimensional Ising model with random
bonds. Our purpose here was simply to show how the Wick transform reproduces the
quantum eﬀect (28), and then to give some ﬂavor of how this eﬀect is measurable.

4 Conclusion

In this article we have shown that the scope of normal ordering has expanded to set-
tings beyond the original one of ordering operators. Several diﬀerent deﬁnitions of Wick
ordering of functions have been discussed and their equivalence established.

For deeper understanding and further applications of these ideas, the interested reader
is invited to consult the quoted literature, which is a selection of texts we found particu-
larly useful. Speciﬁcally, for the physics of functional integrals we enjoy [6]. For a more
mathematically oriented treatment we ﬁnd [7] quite useful.

A Wick ordering of operators in QFT

In this appendix, we brieﬂy remind the reader how the need for Wick ordering arises in
the operator formulation of quantum ﬁeld theory. All of this is standard material and can
be found in any introductory book on quantum ﬁeld theory (e.g.[5]), albeit in lengthier
and more thorough form. We set ~ = 1 throughout.

Consider a real scalar ﬁeld φ(t, x) of mass m deﬁned at all points of four-dimensional

Minkowski spacetime and satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation

where π is the variable canonically conjugate to φ, in fact it is simply π = ∂φ/∂t. Here
we can think of the ﬁrst term as the kinetic energy, and the second as the shear energy.
This classical system is quantized in the canonical quantization scheme by treating the
ﬁeld φ as an operator, and imposing equal-time commutation relations

[φ(t, x), φ(t, x′)] = 0 ,
[π(t, x), π(t, x′)] = 0 ,
[φ(t, x), π(t, x′)] = iδ3(x

x′) ,

The plane-wave solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation are known as the ﬁeld modes,
uk(t, x). Together with their respective complex conjugates u∗
k(t, x) they form a complete
orthonormal basis, so the ﬁeld φ can be expanded as

φ(t, x) =

[ak uk(t, x) + a†

Propagation amplitudes in quantum ﬁeld theory (and hence scattering cross sections
and decay constants) are given in terms of expectation values of time-ordered products of
ﬁeld operators. These time-ordered products arise in the interaction Hamiltonian of an
interacting quantum ﬁeld theory. The goal is to compute propagation amplitudes for these
interactions using essentially time-dependent perturbation theory, familiar from quantum
mechanics. At leading order in the coupling constant, these products can be simpliﬁed,
and the zero-point constant energy removed by using Wick’s theorem.

The way Wick ordering is applied in practice to calculations in QFT is through “Wick’s
theorem”, which gives a decomposition of time-ordered products of ﬁeld operators into
sums of normal-ordered products of ﬁeld operators (again, we refer to e.g. [5]). In this
paper, in section 3.1.3, Wick’s theorem appears in the functional-integral formulation of
the theory.

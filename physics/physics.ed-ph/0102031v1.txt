Discussions of lepton mixing and oscillations consider generally only ﬂavor oscillations of neu-
trinos and neglect the accompanying charged leptons. In cases of experimental interest like pion or
nuclear beta decay an oscillation pattern is expected indeed only for neutrinos if only one of the
two produced particles is observed. We argue that ﬂavor oscillations of neutrinos without detecting
the accompanying lepton is a peculiarity of the two-particle states |lνi produced in pion or nuclear
beta decay. Generally, an oscillation pattern is only found if both particles are detected. We discuss
in a pedagogical way how this distinction of the neutrinos arises, although on the level of the La-
grangian lepton mixing does not single them out against charged leptons. As examples, we discuss
the diﬀerence between the state |lνi produced by the decay of real W boson and a W originating
from pion decay.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has
proven to be a ﬁrm basis on which all our knowledge of
this ﬁeld rests since its construction 30 years ago [1]. Pre-
cision tests performed in the last decade demonstrated
in particular that it is also correct at the quantum level.
Novel phenomena such as neutrino masses or supersym-
metric particles, which cannot be accommodated within
the SM, should not be thought to contradict it, but rather
to guide us as to new physics beyond it. Nowadays, this
hunt for new phenomena is the main topic in particle
physics. In contrast to the search for supersymmetry, for
which there is no positive signal so far1, there is mounting
experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations. On the
one hand, there are ﬁve solar neutrino experiments using
diﬀerent techniques that see a deﬁcit in the solar neu-
trino ﬂux [4]. Although this deﬁcit could have its origin
in principle also in non-standard solar- or nuclear physics,
it can be shown that these explanations are experimen-
tally excluded [5]. On the other hand, the case for an os-
cillation solution to the atmospheric neutrino deﬁcit has
become recently even stronger in the general perception.
This is largely because both the zenith-angle distribu-
tion and the dependence of the ratio νe/νµ as function of
the ratio (oscillation length)/(neutrino energy) found by

1We should however mention that the annual modulation
signal seen by the DAMA experiment can be consistently
explained as the scattering of supersymmetric dark matter
particles on their target nucleons [2]. Also the experimen-
tal evidence for a light Higgs found at LEPII points towards
low-energy supersymmetry [3].

the Superkamiokande collaboration support the neutrino
oscillation hypothesis [6].

Most aspects of neutrino oscillations have been dis-
cussed extensively in the literature. The usual deriva-
tion, presented e.g. in Ref. [7], of the probability P that
a relativistic neutrino with momentum p and ﬂavor α has
the ﬂavor β after the time t,

uses only basic facts of quantum mechanics. Here, El =
l + p2 is the energy of the neutrino mass eigenstate
l and the matrix U is commonly chosen to represent the
p
unitary transformation matrix between weak and mass
eigenstates of the neutrino.
In spite (or, perhaps, be-
cause) of the simplicity of its derivation, Eq. (1) raises
several conceptual questions. The most prominent ones
are if for the neutrino mass eigenstates a deﬁnite energy
or momentum should be used, under which conditions
the use of wave packets with smeared energy and/or mo-
mentum is necessary, the problem of coherence, and the
connection between the quantum mechanical treatment
and quantum ﬁeld theory [8].

In this article we want to discuss a more basic ques-
tion, namely why mixing in the lepton sector reveals it-
self experimentally in ﬂavor oscillations of neutrinos but

not of charged leptons. This question is motivated by
the following simple fact: At the level of the Lagrangian
describing the charged-current interactions of leptons,

CC =

(2)

the mixing V = U (ch)†U (ν) between charged leptons and
neutrinos has two diﬀerent sources: It could be ascribed
either completely to mixing in the neutrino (V = U (ν))
or in the charged lepton sector (V = U (ch)†), or most
probably to some superposition of both. Physical results
do not depend on the particular decomposition of V in
the Standard Model with lepton mixing2. Thus, knowing
only the charged-current Lagrangian, one would not ex-
pect any fundamental diﬀerence between neutrinos and
charged leptons in oscillation experiments. Main pur-
pose of this article is to clarify the exact reason for this
diﬀerence.

Another formulation of this question is to ask for which
conditions it is allowed to neglect the charged lepton pro-
duced together with the neutrino in a two-particle state,
e.g., in the decay of a pion or a real W boson. We will
show that there is a crucial diﬀerence between these two
cases. While in the ﬁrst one the charged lepton plays
only a “spectator rˆole” and can be neglected to a good
approximation, in the second case the two-particle state
has to be considered.

Furthermore, we shall address the question whether
charged leptons can show an oscillation pattern. Usu-
ally it is argued that their oscillation frequencies are too
high to be observable and moreover, that the coherence of
wave packets corresponding to diﬀerent mass eigenstates
is lost under experimental conditions.

In general, an oscillation pattern is observed if 1) the
distance between the source and the detector is smaller
than the coherence length lcoh and 2) the size of the
source and of the detector are smaller than the oscil-
lation length losc. In analogy to neutrino oscillations [9],
the coherence length for charged leptons can be written
as

lcoh = σ

2E2
∆m2 ,

(3)

O

(108 m). The oscillation length losc = 4πE/∆m2
lcoh =
O
(10−11 m). Consequently, the coher-
would amount to
ence condition could be met experimentally while the os-
cillation pattern would be smeared out. If this were the
complete argument, one still could hope to derive infor-
mation about V measuring only charged leptons. We will
show however, that it is necessary to measure the accom-
panying neutrino simultaneously in order to obtain any
information on V .

II. MIXING IN THE LEPTON SECTOR

Let us ﬁrst recall how fermion mass matrices are di-
agonalized. Generally, the mass terms in the Lagrangian
are given by

agonal in the basis of the weak eigenstates. (We denote
the weak eigenstates να =

{
by greek indices α, β . . ., and the mass eigenstates by latin
indices i, j, . . . Furthermore, we have assumed that the
neutrinos have only Dirac mass terms to simplify the for-
mulas). Since the mass matrices are not hermitian, they
cannot be diagonalized by a simple unitary transforma-
tion. However, arbitrary mass matrices can be diagonal-
ized by a biunitary transformation [10],

2We call SM with lepton mixing any model that allows non-
zero neutrino masses but reproduces otherwise in the low-
energy limit the SM. This means in particular that we do not
consider sterile neutrinos.

where we introduced the analogue of the CKM matrix in
the lepton sector [11], V = U (ch)†U (ν). Since the charged
current interaction involves only left-chiral ﬁelds of both
charged leptons and neutrinos, the product of the two
mixing matrices of the right-handed leptons, T (ch)†T (ν),
is unobservable.

In the case of massless neutrinos we can choose the
neutrino mass eigenstates arbitrarily. In particular, we
can set U (ν) = U (ch) for any given U (ch), hereby rotat-
ing away the mixing. This shows that neutrino masses
are a necessary condition for non-trivial consequences of
mixing in the lepton sector.

Finally, we recall that there are no ﬂavor-changing neu-
tral currents within the standard model: The neutral cur-
rent Lagrangian is diagonal both in the weak eigenbasis,

U (ch)†U (ch) = 1.

III. PION DECAY AND LEPTON MIXING

Many neutrino oscillations experiments use as source
for the initial lepton-neutrino state charged pions. In the
SM without lepton mixing, a tree-level calculation gives

Since angular momentum conservation in the pion rest
frame requires a helicity ﬂip of the lepton, the S-matrix
elements of these decays are proportional to the lepton
masses mα and, therefore, the branching into electrons is
suppressed. Hence, the two-particle state

We are ordering the mass eigenstates according to the
value of mi, i.e. ml1 < ml2 < ml3. Thus the state l3 can-
not be populated in pion decay and, therefore, is omitted
in the summation. Furthermore, we have assumed that
all three neutrinos masses are extremely small compared
to the electron mass as it is suggested by the currently
favored interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments
and cosmology. Therefore, we could omit safely new
terms in the S-matrix element proportional to mνi , that
in principle change the branching ratio Eq. (11) from its
SM value [12]. Note that the relative phases Vij of the
diﬀerent components
are ﬁxed by the Lagrangian,
i
while the ai are real numbers. The time evolution of
l+ν(t)
l+ν(t)
π is trivial, because we have expressed

In Eq. (13), we have not displayed explicitly the ﬁnite
lifetimes τ = 1/Γ of the states l2 and ν2,3, because this
point is not essential for our discussion. However, the
ﬁnite lifetimes can be restored treating the energy as a
complex number, E = (m2 + p2)
iΓ/2 and noting that
the decay products of

π do not interfere with it.

Apart from the large diﬀerence between the lifetime
of l2 and of ν2,3, there is another, more important, dis-
tinction between neutrinos and charged leptons. If one

The approximation a2 ≫

scures the fact that even for the choice V = U (ν), i.e.
identifying mass and ﬂavor eigenstates of the charged
leptons, the charged lepton is nevertheless produced in
a mixed state.

Let us now discuss diﬀerent measurements of the ex-
act two-particle state, Eq. (13). Since we are only inter-
ested in ﬂavor oscillations, we do not consider possible
momentum measurements of the two particles. Then,
l+ν(t)
a measurement of the state
π is complete if at
i
|
time t the quantum numbers i or α of both the neutrino
and the charged lepton are determined. In the case that
only one quantum number is observed, the probability
P (l) of this measurement is obtained by summing over
the quantum number of the unobserved particle, symbol-
ically P (l) =

l′ P (l, l′).

P

To begin with, we recall the case normally treated in
the literature, namely that the neutrino ﬂavor is detected
while the lepton is not observed. In a ﬁrst try, we asso-
2 to the
ciate the probability P (lk, να) =

measurement of the lepton mass eigenstate k and the
neutrino ﬂavor eigenstate α at time t. This would result

Let us now comment shortly on the reason for this
asymmetry. A ﬂavor oscillation experiment measures the
correlation between the ﬂavor or mass quantum numbers
of two particles. In the case of pion decay, we can use our
knowledge about the initial state created in the decay as
replacement for an actual measurement of the primary
lepton. However, the kinematic of the decay does not
give us any useful information about the neutrino state:
all three ﬂavor eigenstates are with equal probability pro-
duced. Therefore, the neutrino has to be measured via
its secondary lepton to obtain an oscillation pattern.

From this discussion,

it should became clear that
the diﬀerence between charged leptons and neutrinos in
l+ν
π is rather speciﬁc to the process considered: The
|
i
V–A structure of the weak current together with angular
momentum conservation forbid the decay of the spinless
pion into two massless spin 1/2 particles. Therefore, the
pion decay rate is proportional to the fermion masses m2.
Moreover, it is used that the neutrino masses can be ne-
glected compared to the masses of the charged leptons.
Therefore, the fact that we have no a-priori information

(19)

4

about the neutrino but about the charged lepton is spe-
ciﬁc to pion decay.

Next, we want to discuss if it is possible to measure not
the ﬂavor of a neutrino but its mass without measuring
the lepton. A possible way to do this is to use Cherenkov
or transition radiation of the neutrino [13]. In vacuum,
neutrinos can interact with real photons whose squared
four-momentum q2 is zero only via their electromagnetic
dipole or transition moments. In a medium, the photon
acquires a more complicated dispersion relation (q2
= 0)
and, therefore, neutrinos can emit real photons without
decaying, νi
νi + γ. At least in principle, it is possible
to reconstruct the mass of the radiating neutrino from
the spectra of emitted photons.

In this case, we have the interesting result that P (νl)
depends on the mixing matrix V but does not show an
oscillatory behavior. Compared to a ﬂavor measurement
j Vjl in the
which introduces an additional summation
probability amplitude, the phase of the probability am-
plitude of a mass measurement is constant and, conse-
quently, no oscillation pattern can arise. On the other
hand, P (νl) depends on V because of the factors ak.
Consequently, it is possible to extract information on the
mixing matrix V measuring the mass eigenstate of the
neutrino.

P

Finally, we comment brieﬂy on charged lepton–
neutrino states created in nuclear beta decay. Due to
the low nuclear energies involved, only the state l1 is
produced and, therefore, the charged lepton is not only
approximately but exactly in a pure state.

IV. W DECAY AND LEPTON MIXING

i

We discuss now the evolution of the two-particle state
created by a decaying real W boson. The W bo-
lν
|
son is a spin-1 particle and, therefore, can decay into
two massless fermions. Neglecting small corrections of
W ), the state produced is equally populated for

(m2/m2

all three generations. Thus, while the state

is produced in the SM without lepton mixing by a decay-

We can repeat now the discussion of diﬀerent measure-
l+ν
π. The only change nec-
ments similar to the case of

essary is the replacement of ak/√N by 1/√3. Hence, the
probability to ﬁnd the primary lepton in a mass eigen-

In contrast to Eq. (20), the probability is now symmetric
in lk and l′
m. In particular, the oscillation pattern van-
ishes now in both cases as long as only one particle is ob-
served. Only when both the primary and the secondary
lepton are observed, an oscillation pattern according to
Eq. (26) is observed.

We note that the same observation was made in
Ref. [14]. There, the neutrino state produced in the
decay of a real Z was examined. The authors of
[14]
showed that also in this case neutrino ﬂavor oscillations
can be observed, although the neutrinos are produced by
neutral-current interaction. Moreover, they showed that
it is necessary to measure both neutrinos in order to ob-
serve a oscillation pattern. Thus, their results are in line
with our ﬁndings presented above.

V. CONCLUSION

Flavor oscillations are observed by the detection of cor-
relations between two states.
In an ideal experiment,
the composition of both states is measured. In experi-
ments which use nuclear beta decay to produce the ini-
tial charged lepton–neutrino state the energy available
is limited to nuclear energies. Only the state
can
be populated thus making a measurement of the charged
lepton obsolete.

Experiments in which pion decay create the initial
lepton–neutrino state, one exploits the known branching
ratios into the diﬀerent states
as a substitute for
the measurement of the charged lepton. These branch-
ing ratios diﬀer only for diﬀerent charged lepton mass
eigenstates, but are the same for diﬀerent neutrino states.
Therefore, the knowledge of the branching ratios “re-
places” only a measurement of the state of the charged
lepton, and the measurement of the neutrino state is nec-
essary to obtain information about lepton mixing.
In
contrast, the lepton–neutrino states produced in the de-
cay of real W Bosons are symmetrical in their branching
ratios. If experiments were carried out with such initial
states, both charged lepton and neutrino would be re-
quired to be measured in order to observe ﬂavor oscilla-
tions. In summary, the speciﬁc nature of the initial state

Abstract

We consider a macroscopic body propagating in a one-dimensional resistive

medium, consisting of an ideal gas at temperature T . For a whole family of

collisions with varying degree of inelasticity, we ﬁnd an exact expression for

the eﬀective force on the moving body as a function of the body’s speed and

the value of the restitution coeﬃcient. At low and high speeds it reduces to

the well-known Stoke’s and Newton’s law, respectively.

1 Introduction

When an object moves through a viscous medium, such as water or air, it

experiences a resistive drag force. For small objects such as dust particles

movingh at low speeds, this drag force is proportional to the speed of the

object. This is known as Stoke’s law[1]. For larger objects such as airplanes,

skidivers and baseballs moving at high speeds the drag force is approximately

proportional to the square of the speed[2]. This limit is known as Newton’s

law. The general problem of determining the exact dependence of the drag

force on the speed of an arbitrarily-shaped object moving at any speed, deﬁes

any closed form solution given its complex many-body character. A complete

solution would have to take into account the detailed scattering process be-

tween the body and the particles composing the medium, the thermal prop-

erties of the medium, the presence of possible internal degrees of freedom

of the body and local turbulence eﬀects, etc. However, beneath all these

complexities is basically the transfer of momentum and energy between the

body and the medium particles. Therefore, is instructive to consider simpli-

ﬁed “toy” models where one can track in detail the momentum and energy

exchange between the body and its surrounding medium. This is realized

at the expense of simplifying other factors such as the dimensionality of the

system or the speciﬁc form of the interactions between the body and the

medium. In this spirit, we present here an extension of a previous[3], sim-

pliﬁed zero-temperature one-dimensional model, where we now include ﬁnite

temperature eﬀects. This immediately brings into the game a natural veloc-

ity scale not present in our previous model: the thermal speed. We obtain

the resistive drag force as a function of the body’s speed in closed form

and ﬁnd that, when the speed of the body is smaller than the thermal speed,

the resistive force is linearly proportional to the speed of the body. On the

contrary, when the speed of the body is greater then the thermal speed, the

proportionality becomes quadratic.

2 The Model

Let us consider a (macroscopic) body of mass M propagating in a one-

dimensional resistive medium modelled by an ideal gas in thermodynamic

equilibrium at temperature T , characterized by a thermal speed VT

kT /m,

≡

q

where k is Boltzmann’s constant and m is the mass of a medium particle

(Fig. 1). We assume the body to be truly macroscopic, like a baseball mov-

ing through air, or a falling rock. In other words, M

m which allows us

to make the following simpliﬁcation: During a medium particle-body colli-

≫

sion event, we will take the mass of the body to be essentially inﬁnite. In

this approximation the body is pictured as a massive, partially absorbing,

moving “wall” colliding constantly with the medium particles. A reasonable
assumption, if one considers that the mass ratio m/M is of the order of 10−24

for a baseball moving through air. After each collision, the speed of the body

is essentially unchanged, so the magnitude of the momentum transferred to

the body is

where V is the speed of the body, v the speed of the medium particle and ǫ

is the restitution coeﬃcient for the body-particle collision. Thus, when ǫ = 1

we have a completely elastic collision, where the magnitude of the relative

body-particle velocity is conserved, while at ǫ = 0, we have the case of a

completely inelastic collision, where the particle is “absorbed” by the body

after colliding. We also work in a quasi-continuum approximation where an

element of length dx while “small”, will contain a large number of medium

particles.

Initially the body is given a speed V0 (say, to the right), and we observe

the system at a later time t, when the speed of the body is V . During the

next time interval dt, the body will collide with particles coming from its

left and right side. On the left side, only those particles that have speeds

v > V and are located closer than (v

V )dt will collide with the body. The

number of such particles is dnL = ρdn(v)Θ(v

V )(v

V )dt. In a similar

manner, the number of particles to the right of the body that will collide

with the body during the interval dt is dnR = ρdn(v)Θ(V

Here ρ is the particle number density, Θ(x) is the step function (Θ(x) = 1,

for x > 0, zero otherwise) and dn(v) is the number of particles that have

speeds in the interval [v, v + dv]: dn(v) = g(v)dv where g(v) is the thermal

speed distribution, given by

This rather complex-looking expression is a bit deceiving since it depends on
negative exponentials of (V /VT )2 which makes it very sensitive to whether

V /VT < 1 or V /VT > 1. In other words, we expect two, well-deﬁned behavior

regimes, with a small crossover region near V /VT

3 Results and discussion

As can be clearly seen from (6), the degree of inelasticity plays only a minor

role, renormalizing the number density of the medium. Figure 2 is a log-log

plot of the eﬀective average force on the body as a function of the speed of the

body, Eq.(6). As anticipated above, we note that except for a small vicinity

around V = VT , it consists of basically two straight lines with slopes of one

and two, respectively. That is, at speeds smaller than the thermal speed VT ,

the resistive force is proportional to the body’s speed (Stoke’s law); while for

body’s speeds greater than VT , the resistive force becomes quadratic on the

body’s speed (Newton’s law). These limits are easy to derive from Eq.(6):

Let us now consider the issue of the stopping distance. For a medium at a

ﬁnite temperature, the speed of the body decreases (on a macroscopic scale)

as it moves through the medium and will eventually become smaller than

the thermal speed. At that point, the resistive force becomes proportional

to the speed, F =

β V . A simple integration then leads to an exponential

decrease on V and therefore, a ﬁnite stopping distance. If the medium is at

−

zero temperature however, the resistive force is always quadratic with speed

5

F = γV 2 and, in that case, it can be easily proved that the stopping distance

diverges logarithmically with time[3].

In summary, we have examined a simpliﬁed model of a macroscopic object

propagating in a resistive one-dimensional medium modelled as an ideal gas

at temperature T . For general inelastic collisions between the body and the

medium particles, characterized by a restitution coeﬃcient ǫ, 0

ǫ

1, we

have arrived at a closed-form solution for the resistive force in terms of the

speed of the body. Below the thermal speed, this force is essentially linear

in the body’d speed, while above thermal speed, the dependence becomes

quadratic.

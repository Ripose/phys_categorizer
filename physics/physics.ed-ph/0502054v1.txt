Snell’s Law from an Elementary Particle Viewpoint

D. Drosdoﬀ and A. Widom
Physics Department, Northeastern University, Boston MA 02115

Snell’s law of light deﬂection between media with diﬀerent indices of refraction is usually discussed
in terms of the Maxwell electromagnetic wave theory. Snell’s law may also be derived from a photon
beam theory of light rays. This latter particle physics view is by far the most simple one for
understanding the laws of refraction.

INTRODUCTION

II. CONSERVATION LAWS

Snell’s law of refraction is usually discussed in elemen-
tary physics courses wherein the derivations[1] depend
on the electromagnetic wave theory of light. The pur-
pose of this note is to show how the laws of refraction
may be derived from the particle (i.e. photon) view of
light rays. In particular, we show how the photon Hamil-
tonian H(p, r) must be derived. In this work, p and r
denote, respectively, the momentum and position of a
photon as it moves along the light ray.

In

terms of the indices of refraction, Snell’s law of refraction
asserts[2, 3] that

We assume that the two rays in Fig.1 are made up of
photons with momenta p1 and p2 respectively. We also
assume that the photon energies are E1 and E2 respec-
tively. Since there is translational invariance in direc-
tions parallel to the plane separating the two media, the
photon momentum components parallel to the plane are
conserved ; i.e.

The energies of the photons are also conserved; i.e.

p1 sin θ1 = p2 sin θ2.

E1 = E2.

In terms of physical photon energy and momentum, the
indices of refraction are deﬁned by

The derivation of Eq.(1) from the energy and momentum
conservation laws associated with photon deﬂection is ex-
hibited Sec.II. The index of refraction is then deﬁned in
terms of photon energy and momentum. The relationship
between the index of refraction and the photon velocity
is discussed in Sec.III and from a more general geometric
optics limit in Sec.IV. As an application of the particle
viewpoint, we consider in Sec.V the gravitational lens,
i.e. the bending of light rays in a gravitational ﬁeld.

Eqs.(2)-(4) imply

n1 sin θ1 = n2 sin θ2 ,

which constitutes a simple yet rigorous derivation of
Snell’s law.

Although similar to other treatments which discuss a
formal energy and a formal momentum[4, 5], we stress
that in our treatment we only refer to the physical photon
energy and momentum. For example, E has conventional
units of Joules and momentum p has conventional units
In other more formal treatments,
of Joule-sec/meter.
the so-called “energy” and “momentum” do not have the
usual physical dimensions of energy and momentum.

ray is determined by

In the Maxwell electromagnetic wave theory[7, 8, 9] of
light, u is the phase velocity while v is the group velocity.
Let us consider this in more detail from a purely particle
physics viewpoint.

IV. GEOMETRICAL HAMILTONIAN OPTICS

FIG. 2: An incident photon denoted by γi with impact pa-
rameter b is refracted from a spherical gravitational lens. The
refraction index is n(r) = 1 + (Rs/r). The deﬂection angle Θ
describes the ﬁnal photon denoted by γf .

In inhomogeneous continuous media, the index of re-
fraction in general depends on the photon energy as well
as position. Eq.(4) implies the particle energy restriction

in a gravitational ﬁeld. Newton’s formulation of gravity
attributes the weight of an object to a gravitational ﬁeld

E =

c|p|
n(r, E)

.

(9)

The weight of an object of mass m is

g = −gradΦ.

In principle, the implicit Eq.(9) can be solved for the
energy in the form

w = mg.

E = H(p, r).

(10)

The particle of light, i.e. the photon in the ray, obeys
Hamilton’s equations[10, 11, 12, 13]; They are

˙r =

∂H(p, r)
∂p

and

˙p = −

(11)

∂H(p, r)

.

The velocity of the photon v = ˙r obeys[14]

v =

The force on the photon f = ˙p obeys

f =

[n + E(∂n/∂E)]

.

(13)

For a discontinuity in the index of refraction, such as pic-
tured in Fig.1, the impulsive photon force is normal to the
surface of the discontinuity. That there is no force par-
allel to the surface of the discontinuity leads directly to
Snell’s law as in Sec.II. We note in passing that Hamil-
ton’s Eq.(11) follow from minimizing the optical path

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The laws of refraction have been shown to follow
most easily by employing a classical Hamiltonian, E =
H(p, r), for a photon moving through transparent con-
tinuous media. Snell’s law of refraction at the boundary
of two diﬀerent media is then a simple consequence of
the conservation laws inherent in the Hamiltonian de-
scription of the photon. The use of ray optics in the
design of lens systems is well known. We have here illus-
trated the use of the photon Hamiltonian for the case of
gravitational lens eﬀects in astronomy.

Abstract

In this article we give an introduction to the Fock quantization of the Maxwell
ﬁeld. At the classical level, we treat the theory in both the covariant and
canonical phase space formalisms. The approach is general since we consider
arbitrary (globally-hyperbolic) space-times. The Fock quantization is shown
to be equivalent to the deﬁnition of a complex structure on the classical phase
space. As examples, we consider stationary space-times as well as ordinary
Minkowski space-time. The account is pedagogical in spirit and is tailored to
beginning graduate students. The paper is self contained and is intended to
ﬁll an existing gap in the literature.

I. INTRODUCTION

The motivation to write this article comes from the author’s discomfort with the usual
treatment that textbooks give to the canonical quantization of free ﬁelds in their ﬁrst chapters
[1]. There seems to be a “quantum jump” from the quantization of mechanical systems with
a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom to the quantization of ﬁelds. Here, by ﬁelds we mean
that the classical system to be quantized is described by (at least) one function of space-time.
The best known example is precisely the electro-magnetic ﬁeld, described by six quantities
at each space-time point. In ordinary quantum mechanics, one starts with the phase space
Γ of the system, which is normally given by pairs (qi, pi), i = 1, 2, . . . , n of generalized
coordinates and their conjugate momenta. The quantization procedure implies a passage
from the basic Poisson Brackets (PB) relations
j to the Canonical Commutation
Relations (CCR): [ˆqi, ˆpj] = i¯hδi
j. This is usually called the Dirac quantization condition.
and a representation of the basic observables ˆqi and ˆpi
One ﬁnally ﬁnds a Hilbert space
satisfying the CCR. More precisely, one should ﬁnd at the
as self-adjoint operators on
classical level a set
of elementary observables (real functions) on Γ that are: i) large enough
to generate, via linear combinations of products of them, any function on Γ and ; 2) small
, there
enough to be closed under Poisson Brackets [2]. To these observables, elements of
will be associated a quantum operator in a unique way, satisfying the Dirac quantization
condition. For details see Sec. II.

When the classical system to be quantized is a ﬁeld theory, one is led to ask: Can
we follow the same prescription? that is, can we identify the phase space of the problem
and a set
of basic observables? How is the Poisson bracket deﬁned? Can we implement
the Dirac quantization condition and ﬁnd representations of the CCR? If yes, which is the
? The aim of this paper is to give answers to all this questions when the
Hilbert Space
classical system to be quantized is the free Maxwell ﬁeld. In the case of a Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld, the problem is satisfactorily addressed by Wald [3] (The reader is urged to read the
ﬁrst three chapters of that book). Recall that the Klein Gordon ﬁeld is described by a scalar
ﬁeld Φ on space-time satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation: (22
m2)Φ = 0. The main
diﬀerence between the Klein-Gordon and the Maxwell ﬁeld is gauge invariance. This in turn
brings some subtleties to the program of quantization. These problem are dealt with in this
paper.

The particular quantization method we shall consider is the one known as Fock quantiza-
tion. The intuitive idea is that the Hilbert space of the theory is constructed from “n-particle
states”. (In certain cases one is justiﬁed to interpret the quantum states as consisting of
n-particle states. For a discussion see below.) As we shall see later, the Fock quantization is
naturally constructed from solutions to the classical equations of motion and relies heavily
on the linear structure of the space of solutions (The Klein-Gordon and Maxwell equations
are linear). Thus, it can only be implemented for quantizing linear (free) ﬁeld theories. The
main steps of the quantization are the following: Given a 4-dimensional globally hyperbolic
space-time (M, g)1, the ﬁrst step is to consider the vector space ¯Γ of solutions of the equa-

tions of motion and construct from it the vector space of physically indistinguishable states
Γ. One then constructs the algebra
of fundamental observables to be quantized, which in
this case consists of suitable linear functionals on Γ. The next step is to construct the so
H0 from the space Γ. As mentioned before, the one particle
called one-particle Hilbert space
Hilbert space
H0 receives this name since it can be interpreted as the Hilbert space of a
one particle relativistic system (in the electro-magnetic case, the photon). The one-particle
space is constructed by deﬁning a complex structure on Γ compatible with the naturally
deﬁned symplectic structure thereon, in order to deﬁne a Hermitian inner product on Γ.
The completion with respect to this inner product will be the one-particle Hilbert space
H0 one constructs its symmetric (since we are considering Bose
H0. From the Hilbert space
), the Hilbert space of the theory. The ﬁnal step is to represent the
ﬁelds) Fock space
algebra
of observables in the Fock space as suitable combinations of (naturally deﬁned)
creation and annihilation operators.

We will construct in detail the quantization outlined above for the case of the Maxwell
ﬁeld. In our opinion, an uniﬁed treatment (although completely elementary) is not available
elsewhere. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we give an overview of the
prerequisites to tackle the quantization program.
In particular, we review the canonical
quantization using symplectic language. In the Sec. III we consider the classical treatment
of the Maxwell ﬁeld. We follow two paths in the phase space description of the theory.
The ﬁrst one, the so called covariant phase space starts from the solutions to the equations
of motion. The second approach, the ‘standard’ 3 + 1 formulation, is considered next and
compared to the covariant framework. Sec. IV addresses the quantization. We outline the
quantization strategy starting from the classical analysis and show that it depends on certain
extra structure (a complex structure) deﬁned on the classical phase space. We consider
then two examples of particular interest on Minkowski space-time: the standard ‘positive
frequency’ decomposition and the self dual decomposition. We end with a discussion in
Sec. V.

Throughout the paper, we use Penrose’s abstract index notation2, and units in which

c = 1, but keep ¯h explicit.

II. PRELIMINARIES

In this section we shall present some background material, both in classical and quantum
mechanics. This section has two parts. In the ﬁrst one we will introduce some basic notions of
symplectic geometry that play a fundamental role in the Hamiltonian description of classical

be predicted from conditions at the instant of time represented by a hyper-surface Σ. In technical
terms Σ is a Cauchy surface. For details see [4].

2In this notation, the index ‘a’ of a vector va is to be seen as a label indicating that v is a vector
(very much like the arrow in ~v), and it does not take values in any set. That is, ‘a’ is not the
component of ~v on any basis. For details see [5,6,4]

system as described in Sec. II A.

A. Classical Mechanics

A physical system is normally represented, at the classical level, by a phase space. This
consists of a manifold Γ of dimension dim(Γ) = 2n. Physical states are represented by
the points on the manifold. Observables are smooth, real valued functions on Γ. There is
a non-degenerate, closed symplectic two-form Ω deﬁned on it. The two-form Ωab satisﬁes:
∇[cΩab] = 0, and if ΩabV b = 0 then V b = 0. Therefore, there exists an inverse Ωab and it
deﬁnes an isomorphism between the cotangent and the tangent space at each point of Γ. Here
square brackets over a set of indices means antisymetrization. That is A[ab] := 1
Aba)
(and A(ab)
2 (Aab + Aba)). The space Γ with the symplectic two-form Ω is called a
Symplectic space and denoted by (Γ, Ω).

A vector ﬁeld V a generates inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations if it Lie drags the

symplectic form, i.e.:

This condition is equivalent to saying that locally the symplectic form satisﬁes: V b =
Ωba
f is called the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld
of f (w.r.t. Ω). Note that the symplectic structure gives us a mapping between functions
on Γ and Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds. Thus, functions on phase space (i.e. observables) are
generators of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations.

The Lie Algebra of vector ﬁelds induces a Lie Algebra structure on the space of functions.

The PB is antisymmetric so it is also (minus) the change of g generated by f .

The role of the symplectic structure Ω in symplectic geometry is somewhat similar to the
role of the metric in Riemannian geometry. It provides a one to one mapping between vectors
and one-forms at each point of the manifold. There is however a very important diﬀerence:
In symplectic geometry one can always ﬁnd coordinates (qi, pj) in a ﬁnite neighborhood such
that the symplectic form takes the canonical form (known as Darboux Theorem),

Since the symplectic form is closed, it can be obtained locally from a symplectic potential

Time evolution is given by a vector ﬁeld ha whose integral curves are the dynamical
trajectories of the system. On phase space there is a preferred function, the Hamiltonian H

determines uniquely the symplectic structure. Therefore, the fact that there exists a conﬁg-
uration space picks for us the phase space and the symplectic two-form. For ﬁeld theories
this description is obtained when one performs a 3 + 1 decomposition on space-time and
the phase space is deﬁned from the initial data of the theory. An alternative is to consider
the covariant variational principle, without any decomposition, and construct a naturally
deﬁned symplectic two-form. This is the covariant phase space formalism that will be seen
in Sec. III.

In this form, we recover the usual textbook treatment of Hamiltonian mechanics.

In the case that the system exhibits come gauge freedom in the classical theory, its
description in symplectic language gets modiﬁed. The details are diﬀerent for the covariant
and canonical phase space descriptions, but the common theme is that the phase space
accessible to the system is not a true symplectic space: the two-form Ω is degenerate.
In this case the space is called a pre-symplectic space and Ω is a called a pre-symplectic
structure. In Sec. III we treat the Maxwell system and comment on the strategy to deal
with gauge systems in both descriptions. Let us now look at the quantization.

B. Quantization

In very broad terms, by quantization one means the passage from a classical system, as
described in the last part, to a quantum system. Observables on Γ are to be promoted to
self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert Space. However, we know that not all observables can be
promoted unambiguously to quantum operators satisfying the CCR. A well known example
of elementary
of such problem is factor ordering. What we can do is to construct a subset
classical variables for which the quantization process has no ambiguity. This set
should
satisfy two properties:

S

S

• S

should be a vector space large enough so that every (regular) function on Γ can
be obtained by (possibly a limit of) sums of products of elements in
. The purpose
of this condition is that we want that enough observables are to be unambiguously
quantized.

The set

should be small enough such that it is closed under Poisson brackets.

In the case that the phase space Γ is a linear space, there is a particular simple choice

We can now look at linear functions on Γ. Denote by Y a an element of Γ, and using
the fact that it is linear space, Y a also represents a vector in T Γ. Given a one form λa, we
can deﬁne a linear function of Γ as follows: Fλ(Y ) := λaY a. Note that λ is a label of the
function with Y a as its argument. First, note that there is a vector associated to λa:

so we can write

λa := Ωabλb

Fλ(Y ) = ΩabλaY b = Ω(λ, Y )

Bracket

Fλ, Gν}

{

∇aFλ(Y )

∇bGν(Y ) = Ωabλaνb

Since the two-form is non-degenerate we can re-write it as

Fλ, Gν}

{

= Ωabλaνb. Thus,

Ω(λ, Y ), Ω(ν, Y )

= Ω(λ, ν)

}
As we shall see in Sec. IV we can also make such a selection of linear functions for the
Maxwell ﬁeld.

The quantum representation is the ordinary Schr¨odinger representation where the Hilbert

follows we shall develop both approaches and show their equivalence.

A. Covariant Phase Space

In this part we shall introduce and employ the covariant phase space formulation [8].
Since in our opinion this formalism is not widely known, we shall outline the main steps
using the Maxwell ﬁeld as an example. The starting point for the construction of the
covariant phase space is the identiﬁcation of the symplectic vector space Γ, the phase space
of the problem, starting from solutions to the equations of motion. Let us start by writing
down the action for the free Maxwell theory:

Therefore we have the full set of Maxwell equations. The second term in Eq (3.2), the
boundary term, is often referred to as the symplectic current. It can be interpreted as a
1-form on the space ¯Γ of solutions to the equations of motion (it is analog to the symplectic
potential ω introduced in Sec. II). It is acting on the vector δAa and producing a number. We
can take now another ‘variation’ of this term in order to get the conserved (pre)-symplectic

about functional analytic issues. We are just requiring falloﬀ conditions (on any Σ) such
that the symplectic form at spatial

solutions of the Maxwell equations that induce data of compact support on any Cauchy
surface, that conditions will be satisﬁed4. This bilinear mapping deﬁned by Ω is, however,

are the degenerate directions of Ω. The fact that the two-form Ω is degenerate on ¯Γ is an
indication that there is some gauge freedom in the system. Let us now try to identify what
the degenerate directions of Ω are. Since we are restricting ourselves to the space ¯Γ, the
tangent vectors satisfy the linearized equation of motion, that in this case coincide with the
Maxwell equations. Consider vectors of the type Xa =
∇aΛ for some function Λ. Then,
using the fact that it satisﬁes

∇[aXb] = 0 we have,

We can conclude that the degenerate directions of Ω are of the form
∇aΛ. This is the
manifestation, in the covariant phase space approach, of the “gauge freedom” present in
electro-magnetism. In order to get a true symplectic space, we should take the quotient of
¯Γ by the degenerate directions of Ω to get Γ, the (reduced) phase space of the theory. Note
that Γ can be equivalently parameterized by the equivalence class of gauge potentials [Aa],
where A

We can now write the (weakly non-degenerate) symplectic form on Γ:

Note that it is well deﬁned on Γ since it does not depend on the representative of the

The next step is to construct observables of the theory, namely, real valued functions on
Γ. A natural strategy is to use the symplectic form in order to construct such functions. Let

(3.6)

∇aT ab = 0. Therefore, an element ha of Γ deﬁnes by itself a linear observable,
which implies
since ha and ha +
∇aΛ deﬁne the same function. In the quantum theory, to each of this
observables there will correspond a quantum operator, making the correspondence between
solutions to Maxwell equations and quantum operators precise.

Let us re-write the symplectic form (3.4) in terms of the familiar electric and magnetic
ﬁelds. Recall that given a local observer with four velocity ta (tata =
1), then the electric
ﬁeld with respect to this observer is given by Ea := tbFba. It is naturally deﬁned as a 1-form.
Since we have a metric we can ‘raise’ the index and deﬁne the corresponding vector ﬁeld.

We can also deﬁne the dual tensor of the ﬁeld Fab by: ∗F ab := 1
2 ǫabcdFcd, where ǫabcd is the
canonical volume form deﬁned by the metric gab with all its indices raised with the metric.
The magnetic ﬁeld is deﬁned by Ba := tb
∗Fba. In the integrand of the symplectic form, one
is contracting the tensor F ab with the unit normal na to the surface Σ (that is the meaning
of dΣa := ǫabcd dΣbcd), so we get naturally the electric ﬁeld Ea with respect to Σ. We can
now express (3.4) as follows,

Ω(F, ˜F ); =

(Ea ˜Aa −

˜EaAa) √h d3x .

(3.7)

This expression can be rewritten in terms of objects deﬁned purely on the hyper-surface Σ.

Note that the pullback to Σ of the dual tensor ∗Fab is, in a 3-dimensional sense, the electric

˜ηcabEab, which is, as we shall later see, the electric ﬁeld arising from the canonical approach.
Here, ˜ηabc is the naturally deﬁned completely anti-symmetric Levi-civita density of weight
one on Σ.

B. Canonical Phase Space

In this part we shall present the canonical phase space description of the Maxwell Field,
which is normally known as the ‘Dirac Analysis’ [9]. However, our presentation will be
‘covariant’ in the sense that our analysis is coordinate free; that is, we do not assume any
coordinate system on M. The action (3.1) can be written in a 3 + 1 fashion. First we write
the expression for the action as follows,

Next, we decompose the space-time metric as follows: gab = hab

(inverse of) the induced metric on the Cauchy hyper-surface Σ and na the unit normal to Σ.
We also introduce an everywhere time-like vector ﬁeld ta and a ‘time’ function t such that
the hyper-surfaces t =constant are diﬀeomorphic to Σ and such that ta

Asking that the constraint be preserved in time with respect to the Hamiltonian (3.15)
∇a ˜Πa
leads to the secondary constraint χ2 :=
0. There are no extra constraints. They
form a First Class system6. One can eliminate the ﬁrst one by giving the gauge condition
χ3 := φ
0, with λ an arbitrary function on Σ. We can reduce the constraints
(χ1, χ3) since they form a second class pair. We are then left with the Gauss constraint
χ2 =
0. Now, φ has the role of a Lagrange multiplier. Therefore, the phase
space Γ′ is coordinatized by the pairs (Aa, ˜Πb), having three degrees of freedom per point.
The constraint surface ˆΓ are the point in Γ′ where the Gauss constraint is satisﬁed.
In
the canonical picture, gauge transformations are those canonical transformations generated
by the (ﬁrst class) constraints. The reduced phase space Γc is then the space of orbits
generated by the gauss constraint in ˆΓ. The canonical transformation generated by the
(smeared) Gauss constraint, G[λ] =

∇b ˜Πbd3x, is given by,
Aa − ∇aλ .
Therefore, the (reduced) phase space is given by pairs ([A], ˜Π) of gauge equivalence class of
connections and vector densities satisfying Gauss’ law. Thus, we recover the two true degrees
of freedom the the Maxwell ﬁeld has (corresponding to the two types of polarization). One
alternative to the reduced phase space description is to impose a gauge condition in order to
select one particular representative from the equivalence class. A convenient gauge choice
aAa = 0. This is a good gauge condition since the pair
in this case is to ask that χ4 :=
(χ2, χ4) forms a second class pair7. Thus, we can coordinatize Γc by (Aa, Ea), a pair of
divergence-less (transverse) vector ﬁelds on Σ. We have used the fact that we have a metric
on Σ to de-densitize the momenta ˜Π.

We can now relate the two approaches and see that the phase space Γ from last section is
precisely the space Γc constructed via the canonical approach. The key observation is that
there is a one to one correspondence between a pair of initial data of compact support on Σ,
satisfying the transverse condition, and solutions to the Maxwell equations on M, modulo
gauge transformations (an element of Γ) [4]. Therefore, to each element Fab in Γ there is a
pair (Aa, Ea) on Γc (2
∇[aAb] = Fab and Ea = habncFcb and more importantly, for each pair,
there is a solution to Maxwell’s equations that induces the given initial data on Σ. Here,
‘underline’ denotes restriction to Σ. From now on, we shall refer to elements of the vector
space Γ in-distinctively either as Fab or as (Aa, Eb).

Observables for the space Γ can be constructed directly by giving smearing functions on Σ
(compare to the discussion of the previous section in which the observables were constructed
from space-time smearing objects). Given a 1-form ga on Σ we can deﬁne,

As we have seen, the phase space Γ can be alternatively described by equivalence classes

Note that in this case, the 1-particle Hilbert space consists of ‘positive frequency’

It is important to note that the only input we needed in order to construct

was the
complex structure J. For a general space-time there is no preferred one. This in turn leads to
the inﬁnite ambiguity in the representation of the CCR. In the case of stationary space-times
there is a preferred, canonical, complex structure given by the Killing ﬁeld. This construction
for the case of the Klein Gordon ﬁeld is described in [10]. For Minkowski space-time there
are several ways of characterizing the usual quantization. The standard textbook treatment
uses a (globally inertial) time coordinate t to perform the positive-frequency decomposition.
Another way of selecting this decomposition is to ask that the vacuum on the resulting
theory be Poincar´e invariant. A third way is to ask that the coherent states in the quantum
theory have the same energy as the classical solution on which they are peaked [12].

D. Examples

As mentioned at the end of Sec. IV A, the choice of a complex structure J is far from
being a straightforward process. For a general space-time, there is no a-priori criteria to
select one. Furthermore, there are an inﬁnite number of choices that give inequivalent
quantum theories [3]. In the special case that there exists a time-like Killing vector ﬁeld ta
on the spacetime (M, g); that is, for a stationary space-time, there exists a canonical choice
of complex structure given by the killing ﬁeld. From the physical viewpoint, this choice is
motivated because it gives to coherent states peaked at a particular solution an energy equal
to the classical energy associated to that solution [12]. The complex structure is given by,

A particular important example of a space-time with a globally deﬁned Killing ﬁeld is
Minkowski space-time (in fact it has an inﬁnite number of such vector ﬁelds, one for each
inertial reference frame). From now on, let us restrict our attention to Minkowski space-
time and inertial hyper-surfaces Σ. Therefore, the induced metric hab is the Euclidean
ﬂat metric. We will perform two diﬀerent decompositions of Γ, for two diﬀerent complex
structures. First, we shall consider the ordinary ‘positive frequency’ decomposition. This
leads to the standard quantum theory of the free Maxwell ﬁeld found in textbooks. Next,
we decompose Γ in self-dual and anti-self-dual ﬁelds.

vector ﬁelds, making also the expression for the norm look simple (4.19).

We are now in position of asking whether an observable generated by the pair (ga, f a)
). Clearly, if the pair (ga, f a) belongs to the 1-
induces a well deﬁned operator on
particle Hilbert space
the answer is in the aﬃrmative. We shall take this criteria also
as necessary condition. The question is now whether the pair (ga, f a) deﬁnes an element of
Γ, namely, whether they are ‘well behaved’ initial data for a solution of Maxwell equations
with ﬁnite norm. This will be the case iﬀ the norm of (ga, f a), given by Eq.
(4.19), is
ﬁnite. This question is of relevance when deﬁning observables given by the ﬂuxes of electric
and magnetic ﬁeld across surfaces bounded by closed loops. The Heisenberg uncertainty

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have introduced the Fock quantization for the classical Maxwell ﬁeld.
We have seen that given a phase space point, that is, a solution to Maxwell equations on
space-time (or equivalently, a pair (A, E) of initial data), we can construct a quantum state
via a creation operator. There are several questions that come to mind. First, How can we
make contact with the ordinary treatment of Fock spaces given in textbooks? Recall that,
from the outset, the basic ﬁelds are written in a Fourier expansion. This already assumes
a vector space structure for the background space-time (Minkowski) and a globally deﬁned
vector ﬁeld (time coordinate) in order to perform the Fourier transform. The expression
(4.19), when re-expressed in the Fourier components takes the familiar form of the inner
product found everywhere. This proof is left as an exercise for the reader.

Second, we can ask how is that the particle interpretation of the theory arises? We
have used solutions to Maxwell equations to create the ‘n-particle states’, but a classical
electro-magnetic ﬁeld certainly does not look like a particle. Let us recall how it is done in
ordinary textbooks. In that case, the solution to the Maxwell equations is written in terms
of a plane wave expansion (via a Fourier transform), and each plane wave with wave vector
~k is interpreted as (the wave function) of a photon of momentum in the ~k direction. Thus,
the Fock space is constructed from plane waves, each with the interpretation of a ‘particle’.
Strictly speaking, plane waves are not normalizable and, therefore, do not belong to our
phase space Γ.

Finally, we can ask how the Fock quantization compares with the standard Schr¨odinger
representation we are used to in ordinary quantum mechanics. Recall that in this case,
quantum states are given by complex-valued functions on conﬁguration space ψ(qi). There
is however, a unitarily equivalent representation where the wave functions are (analytic)
functions on phase space φ(zj = qj
ipj). This is the so called Bargmann representation
of quantum mechanics. This is not usually done in ordinary quantum mechanics, but we
could in fact construct a Fock space for the harmonic oscillator, where the ‘particles’ would
kets, corresponding to
be quanta of energy [3]. In this case the basis is given by the
the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The most natural representation for this construction,
in terms of wave-functions is the one given by Bargmann. Thus, the Fock representation

is the ﬁeld theory analog of the complex Bargmann representation (for details see [12]). Is
there in ﬁeld theory the analog of the Schr¨odinger representation? Can we construct it? The
answer to both questions is in the aﬃrmative. In the Schr¨odinger representation, quantum
states are functionals of the potential Aa on Σ, Ψ(A) and the basic observables (3.20) and
(3.21) are represented as derivative and multiplicative operator respectively [18]. Just as
in ordinary quantum mechanics, where the Schr¨odinger and Bargmann representations are
connected by a coherent state transform, there is a similar transformation in ﬁeld theory
relating Schr¨odinger and Fock states. Which of this representations is more useful? The
answer depends on the situation. Fock representations are very useful when considering
scattering processes. In perturbation theory one considers incoming free states and outgoing
free states (belonging to the Fock space) and one tries to approximate the Scattering matrix
relating them using a perturbative expansion. The problem with this approach, from the
mathematical viewpoint, is that this procedure is not completely justiﬁed [19]. To explain
why, then, perturbation theory is so succesful is still an open problem. The natural way to
construct a quantum theory for non-linear ﬁelds is then the Schr¨odinger representation (or
its path integral variant), but progress in this direction has been slow [20].

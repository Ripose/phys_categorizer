Fermi and Bose pressures in statistical mechanics

Loyal Durand∗
Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison
Madison, WI 53706

I show how the Fermi and Bose pressures in quantum systems, identiﬁed in standard discus-
sions through the use of thermodynamic analogies, can be derived directly in terms of the ﬂow
of momentum across a surface by using the quantum mechanical stress tensor. In this approach,
analogous to classical kinetic theory, pressure is naturally deﬁned locally, a point which is obvious in
terms of the stress-tensor but is hidden in the usual thermodynamic approach. The two approaches
are connected by an interesting application of boundary perturbation theory for quantum systems.
The treatment leads to a simple interpretation of the pressure in Fermi and Bose systems in terms
of the momentum ﬂow encoded in the wave functions. I apply the methods to several problems,
investigating the properties of quasi continuous systems, relations for Fermi and Bose pressures,
shape-dependent eﬀects and anisotropies, and the treatment of particles in external ﬁelds, and note
several interesting problems for graduate courses in statistical mechanics that arise naturally in the
context of these examples.

INTRODUCTION

(1.4)

The concept of pressure in quantum systems is usually introduced in equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics using
thermodynamic analogies. Thus, the Helmholtz free energy F is identiﬁed with the logarithm of the the canonical
partition function Z, and the thermodynamic potential Ω, with the logarithm of the grand partition function
through the relations

Z

Here Z is deﬁned as the usual sum over the energies in the system,

is then deﬁned for an indeﬁnite number of particles by

where µ is the chemical potential. The pressure is customarily determined through one of the standard thermodymanic
relations

P =

∂F/∂V = (kT /Z)(∂Z/∂V )

or

P V =

with F evaluated at ﬁxed temperature T and particle number N , and Ω, at ﬁxed T and µ. In the second case, the
average particle number and chemical potential are related by the condition N =

∂Ω/∂µ.

These relations can be checked in classical particle statistical mechanics by an appeal to the results of kinetic theory,
and can be further motivated by an appeal to the concept of generalized forces when the energy of a system depends
explicitly on external parameters such as its volume. However, standard discussions do not show directly how the
pressure relations arise in a kinetic theory-like context in quantum statistical mechanics. For a sampling of standard
treatments, see Refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

The objective of this paper is to give direct derivations of the pressure in Fermi and Bose systems using ideas
analogous to those in kinetic theory, speciﬁcally the relation of pressure to momentum ﬂow and the quantum stress
tensor. These are well deﬁned ideas in quantum systems, give a “quantum kinetic theory” approach to pressure, and
lead to a direct interpretation of the pressure in Fermi and Bose systems in terms of the momentum ﬂow encoded
in the wave functions. I will show, in fact, that pressure is naturally deﬁned locally, a point which is obvious in the
stress-tensor approach but is hidden in the usual thermodynamic approach. The two approaches are connected by an
interesting application of boundary perturbation theory for quantum systems.

The basic ideas and relations in my approach are developed in Sec. II, and their use for systems of noninteracting
fermions and bosons, in Sec. III. I then consider several examples including the properties of quasi continuous systems,
relations for Fermi and Bose pressures, and shape-dependent eﬀects and anisotropies in Sec. IV A, and examples for
particles in external ﬁelds in Sec. IV B. The results lead to several interesting problems for graduate courses in
statistical mechanics.

II. PRESSURE IN STATISTICAL SYSTEMS

A. Pressure and the stress tensor

The pressure of a system at a point x on a surface S can be deﬁned as the rate of momentum ﬂow dp/dt across a

surface element dS = ˆn dS at x,

dp
dt
that is, in terms of the force per unit area or stress acting across the surface. P depends implicitly on the orientation
of the surface through ˆn, but I will not indicate this explicitly both for notational simplicity, and because the apparent
ˆn dependence is, in fact, absent for the familiar extensive, quasi continuous systems. I will apply this deﬁnition in the
quantum context. For deﬁniteness, consider a quantum system of N identical particles with the Lagrangian density

and diﬀerent particle labels, and organizing the results as much as possible into a set of divergences, I ﬁnd after a

where Z is the canonical partition function in (1.2). The sums are over all completely symmetric states for Bose
systems, and over all completely antisymmetric states for Fermi systems.

I would emphasize that the wave functions ψ(x)1, . . . , xN should include any factors such as spin eigenfunctions nec-
essary to describe internal structure that does not aﬀect the original Schr¨odinger equation. The sums over eigenstates
include sums over the extra quantum numbers necessary to label the states completely. In the case of observables
such as the total number density or pressure that do not depend on the internal structure, the ψ’s can be reduced to
spatial wave functions, and the right hand sides of (2.16) multiplied by the appropriate degeneracy factor g. I will
follow this convention throughout the paper.

Equation(2.16), or the more general form in (2.14), gives my basic “quantum kinetic theory” result. The diﬀerences
between fermions and boson enter only through the symmetry properties of the wave functions and the resulting
diﬀerences in the sums over states. Before going on to investigate these in simple cases, I would reemphasize that the
kinetic deﬁnition of the pressure is intrinsically local and is expressed through the action of the momentum operators
i¯h∇ as would be expected on the basis of classical kinetic theory. It is not immediately clear how this deﬁnition of
−
the pressure is connected with the usual “thermodynamic” deﬁnition in (1.4). I will ﬁrst show that the two deﬁnitions
are equivalent when one considers local variations of the volume in the relation P = kT ∂ ln Z/∂V .

The thermodynamic deﬁnition (1.4) of pressure in terms of the canonical partition function gives the relation

A comparison of this expression with (2.16) suggests that ∂Eα/∂V should be expressible for local variations in V
in terms of the normal derivative of ψα on the boundary surface. This is, in fact, easy to show using boundary
perturbation theory. I consider a small change in the volume of the system implemented by moving the boundary
surface outward over a small surface patch ∆S through a normal displacement δx = ˆn δx(x) that varies smoothly
over dS and vanishes elsewhere. The energy E′
α of the system in the distorted volume will diﬀer from the energy Eα
of the original system, with E′

terms in (2.26) all drop out, and the time-independent pressure Pα(x) is again given by the the expression in (2.15)
and depends only on the normal derivatives of ψ and ψ∗. The more general expression in (2.14) can be used for a
surface element in the interior of the conﬁning volume.

A calculation similar to that in Sec. II B also reproduces (2.15) for static ﬁelds and stationary systems. The
A-dependent terms again drop out on the conﬁning surface, and the expression for δEα obtained in boundary per-
turbation theory reduces to (2.21).

III. PRESSURE IN NONINTERACTING BOSE AND FERMI SYSTEMS

A. Bose systems

As a ﬁrst example, I will consider the important case of noninteracting bosons in an external ﬁeld. Interparticle

interactions can be treated approximately using standard methods. See, for example, Refs. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

The Hamiltonian for N noninteracting subsystems or particles is a sum of N identical single-particle Hamiltonians
H1, H =
satisfy the Schr¨odinger equations
H1ψk(xl) = Ekψk(xl). I will suppose that the energy eigenvalues have been ordered so that E1 < E2 < E3 < . . ..
The total energies are simply sums of single-particle energies Ek, and can be labeled by the number of particles in
each single-particle eigenstate

IV. EXAMPLES

A. Quasi continuous systems

1. General considerations

The systems to which statistical descriptions are applied most frequently are large, extensive systems in which the
potentials are uniform or periodic. A well-known theorem shows that the number of eigenvalues Ek smaller than a
. [See Kac, Ref. 11, for a famous discussion
ﬁxed value E grows proportionally to the volume of the system for V
of this result and its history in the context of the spectrum of a drum.] The eigenvalues therefore pack together for V
large, surface eﬀects on the spectrum become negligible, and it is plausible that the sums over states in the preceding
sections can be converted to integrals when there are many states with energies less than kT . The main question
concerns the behavior of the wave functions in the limit of large V . We expect, in fact, that the products ψ∗(x)ψ(x)
and ∇ψ∗(x)
∇ψ(x) will each reduce for large V to the sum of a term describing their smooth average behavior, and
extra rapidly oscillating terms that average approximately to zero. The result should again be insensitive to surface
eﬀects for V suﬃciently large.

The typical index for states excited at temperature T is nex ∼

Note that the ﬁnal result for the leading term is isotropic in momentum space even though the original spectrum in
(4.1) is diﬀerent for motions in the diﬀerent directions. This appears to be general for quasi continuous systems; see,
for example, Sec. IV B 1. With enough energy levels occupied in the thermal distribution, the details of the spectrum
become unimportant.

A calculation of the pressure using the method above and either of Eqs. (3.11) or (3.12) for Bose systems, or (3.16)

or (3.17) for Fermi systems leads to analogous results for the pressure on a surface with normal ˆn,

are isotropic in momentum space. Thus, the leading term in the expression for the pressure is independent of the

I would emphasize that this result for the local pressure follows directly from the deﬁnition of the pressure in terms
ˆn, and
of the stress on a surface. The factors of ˆn
correspond directly to the momenta that appear in the elementary classical derivation of the pressure in a gas. That
is, the pressure is associated with the “beating of the particles against the wall.”

The thermodynamic deﬁnition gives the same pressure for the quasi-homogeneous system under consideration, and
the two deﬁnitions are connected by boundary perturbation theory as shown in Sec. II B. The derivation given there
can be generalized to an arbitrary surface inside the volume V , but is only useful provided that, as here, enough is
known about the wave functions to allow explicit evaluation of their derivatives.

It is easy to derive the nonclassical properties of the Fermi and Bose pressures. An integration by parts in spherical

The diﬀerence clearly arises in the momentum-ﬂow or stress picture from the necessity that the occupied single-
particle states all be diﬀerent for Fermi-Dirac statistics. This forces the appearance of higher momentum states than
are needed in the Bose-Einstein case, and a higher pressure for ﬁxed N and T .

As an example of Bose pressure, I will calculate the pressure of an equilibrium system of noninteracting neutral
mesons with mass m. The system will be taken as extensive or quasi continuous in dimension D. The pressure on

the usual result. However, I would again emphasize that the calculation is direct, and is clearly connected to the ﬂow
of momentum across the surface through the discussion in Sec. II C 1. No thermodynamic relations were used.

An example for Fermi systems that makes a good homework problem and shows the relation of pressure to mo-
mentum ﬂow is the calculation of the Fermi pressure at T = 0 staring from the stress tensor. The usual argument for
completely degenerate Fermi systems shows that all energy levels up to a Fermi energy EF determined by N must be

The remaining calculation is simple for continuous systems, and leads directly to the thermodynamic result without

3. Anisotropic pressures

The corrections from the conversion of sums to integrals in (4.6), and the corrections from ﬁnite-size eﬀects in the
spectrum,11 are shape-dependent. This shape dependence leads for ﬁnite systems to anisotropic stresses or pressures.
Consider, for example, the limit in which one of the dimensions of the rectangular box considered above, say L1,
becomes small while the other dimensions remain large. If the lowest energy for motions in the 1 direction is large on
the scale of kT , h2/8mL2
kT , the sum over n1 converges rapidly, and conversion of that sum to an integral with
1 ≫
only small residual corrections is not possible. Keeping just the leading term in n1 and treating the large dimensions
in the continuum limit, the number density becomes

The eﬀects are small in practice, with E1/k = 0.2 K for a helium atom conﬁned in a gap with L1 = 1 nm.
Anisotropies in the pressure would only be observable at lower temperatures. The situation is more complicated for
electrons because of the eﬀects of Fermi-Dirac statistics.

B. Pressure and number density in an external ﬁeld

1. WKB approximation

It is simple to treat the problem of otherwise noninteracting particles in a one-dimensional external potential V (x)
using the standard WKB approximation discussed in most texts on quantum mechanics (see, for example, Ref. 12).
The single-particle energies Ek are determined in this approximation by the semiclassical quantization condition, that

for E = Ek, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Here p(E, x) =
V (x)] is the local momentum deﬁned classsically at energy E,
h is Planck’s constant, and x1, x2 are turning points in the classical motion where p(E, x) = 0. The approximation
can be shown to be good when there are many local wavelengths h/p between the turning points, but tends to be
good even for low-lying states in the spectrum. Since the typical excitation energy in statistical systems is E
kT ,
the WKB approximation will be valid provided h−1

The result in (4.25) is just that obtained through thermodynamic arguments6 by dividing the system into small
volumes over which V (x) can be taken as constant, and then considering the equilibrium of the subsystems. The
result, as here, is to replace the chemical potential µ in the corresponding expression for free particles by µ
V (x).
However, it is clear from the WKB-based derivation above that there are two key points in the quantum treatment.
First, the average number k of excited states must be large enough and vary smoothly enough for energies on the
scale of kT that the sum over states can be replaced by an integral. Second, the square of the wave function must
oscillate suﬃciently rapidly over regions in which E
1/2 is
valid in the sum in (4.25). The second requirement is closely linked to the conditions needed for the validity of the
WKB approximation, and for the replacement of the sum by an integral. It is worth noting in this connection that
the wave function is deﬁned over the entire volume in which the system is conﬁned, and not just subvolumes as in
Ref. 6.

The general result in (4.26) could probably also be derived in three dimensions using a WKB-like phase-integral
approximation such as that investigated by Gutzwiller, Ref. 15, but I have not attempted this.

The pressure or stress in the external potential can be treated similarly. I will work in the interior of the total
volume and use the general expression for the pressure given in (2.14), and the single-particle form of the stress tensor
in (2.11), specialized to one dimension. The key step involves the recognition that the derivatives in (2.11) can be

I turn next to two examples which illustrate the eﬀects of external ﬁelds in interesting physical situations. Both

lead to useful homework problems for graduate courses in statistical physics.

2. Example: Particles in a linear potential

For particles in a linear potential V (z) = V0 ×

(z/z0) with no potentials for the motion in the transverse directions,
the motion in z can be described in the WKB approximation as above, while the motion in the transverse coordinates
can be described in terms of running waves with momenta p⊥ = (px, py). The single-particle energies are

(4.32)

The corrections for Fermi or Bose statistics are unimportant for gases in a gravitational ﬁeld under normal con-
ditions. Following the development in Sec. IV B 1 with the Fermi or Bose factors replaced by the simple Boltzmann
factor e−β(Ek−µ), one obtains the classical barometric equations

P (z) = P (0)e−mgz/kT , n(z) = n(0)e−mgz/kT , P (0) = n(0)kT.

(4.33)

For a system with area A, the number density n(0) at z = 0 is given in terms of the total number of particles N by
the integral

N =

d3x n(x) = n(0)

so n(0) = (N/A)(mg/kT ) and P (0) = N mg/A. The result is as expected. Note, as remarked above, that the pressure
is isotropic at any point, Tx,x = Ty,y = Tz,z, even though the potential is not, and isotropy was not used in the
derivation. This is general for quasi continuous systems at suﬃciently high excitation.

A more interesting result with respect to the gravitational ﬁeld is the existence of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an
ideal system at suﬃciently low temperatures, an example that makes a good homework problem in a graduate course.
The particle number for the Bose system is given in (3.9). This becomes

There is no condensation for free motion in two dimensions.

The calculations of the local number density and pressure in an external ﬁeld are simple for dilute systems for which
the Fermi and Bose statistical factors reduce in ﬁrst approximation to the usual Boltzmann factor. They cannot be
done exactly when quantum corrections are important, with many particles within a volume of a thermal wavelength
cubed, but are similar numerically to the calculation of N (x) in the following example.

A very sharp ground-state peak appears in the initially rather broad in the number density as as T is lowered below
Tc in qualitative agreement with the original experiments in 16,17,18. This makes an an interesting comparison, and
gives a real feeling for how the theory relates to observed Bose-Einstein condensates.

The pressure in the trapped system can be calculated similarly, and balances the force from the conﬁning oscillator
potentials. However, because of the long mean free path for particle intractions, it is not relevant for the expansion
of the condensate when the conﬁning interactions are suddenly removed.

The main objective of this paper was to give direct derivations of the pressures in Fermi and Bose systems using
the relation of pressure to momentum ﬂow and the quantum stress tensor. This “quantum kinetic theory” approach

is simple conceptually, and shows that the pressure is naturally deﬁned locally, a point of interest for particles in
external ﬁelds. It leads also to a direct understanding of the diﬀerence in Fermi and Bose pressures at ﬁxed particle
number and temperature in terms of the diﬀerent momentum states excited, a point often argued qualitatively. A
bonus of the analysis was the appearance of the simple examples of the use the use of boundary perturbation theory in
quantum mechanics necessary to establish the connection of the of the usual thermodynamic arguments for particles
and ﬁelds to the results obtained directly in stress-tensor approach.

I also discussed the properties of extensive, quasi-continuous systems, showed the role of excitations high on the
scale of kT in obtaining isotropic pressures in intrinsically anisotropic systems, and illustrated the appearance of
anisotropies and the eﬀective reduction of the dimension of a system at low enough temperatures. Finally, I gave an
explicit WKB derivation of the usual expressions for the number density and pressure of particles in an external ﬁeld,
and presented several examples which illustrate the use of the stress-tensor method in real physical problems. I have
found these examples to make good homework problems in a graduate course on statistical mechanics.

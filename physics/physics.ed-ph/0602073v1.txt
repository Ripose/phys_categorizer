We propose a revisitation of the original experiment performed by H. Hertz in 1888. With a
simple setup it is possible to produce electromagnetic waves with a frequency in the range of 3
MHz. By performing Fourier analysis of the signal captured by a resonant antenna it is possible to
study the behaviour of the RLC series circuit, frequency splitting of coupled resonances and ﬁnally
the characteristics of the near-ﬁeld emitted by the loop antenna.

Heinrich Hertz is best known for his series of ex-
periments conducted from 1886 onwards with which he
demonstrated that the predictions of C. Maxwell were
correct [1, 2].
Indeed he succeeded in showing that it
is possible to generate electromagnetic (EM) waves, that
these propagate in free space with a well deﬁned oscilla-
tion frequency and wavelength, that is possible to observe
interference between these waves and most importantly,
that these transport energy. Within the same group of
experiments H. Hertz also experimentally observed for
the ﬁrst time many other eﬀects, most notably the pho-
toelectric eﬀect. The incredible importance and impact
of these experiments is therefore clear and needs no fur-
ther comment. Yet, notwithstanding this importance it is
fairly rare to ﬁnd these experiments reproduced in some
form or another. The scope of this paper is to give a de-
scription of the possibilities oﬀered by an experimental
setup that represents a variation of the original “Hertz”
setup but is able to give an insight and a direct measure-
ment of many aspects related to EM emission. Among
these a clear demonstration of power transmission, a pre-
cise characterization of a loop antenna emission, the ob-
servation of frequency splitting due to resonator coupling
and ﬁnally the near-ﬁeld decay of the electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds created by a loop antenna.
The setup we used is a very simple RLC circuit designed
as shown in Figs.1 and 2. A capacitance C of 1 nF (15
kV maximum voltage, from RS components) is connected
to 1 m diameter loop antenna (A) obtained by bending
a simple piece of copper tubing (1 inch diameter). The
inductance of the antenna L is one of the quantities that
we will measure with the setup: we found (see below)
roughly 5 µF yet we noticed that using diﬀerent diameter
tubing does not change greatly this value. The resistance
of this circuit is provided directly by the circuit itself (e.g.
the antenna has R = 1.2 Ω). The whole circuit is pow-
ered by a 6kV transformer (T). This may be found from
a neon-light dealer at a relatively low cost. Finally an
important part of the circuit is the spark-switch (S) in-
serted in one of the arms between the capacitor C and the
antenna A. This was constructed by taking two rounded
bolts with a housing that allowed to regulate the distance

between the rounded extremities (see the inset to Fig.2).
The 6 kV voltage supply oscillates at 50 Hz. As the volt-
age on the capacitor increases, it does so also between the
two extremities of the bolts. The breakdown threshold
in air is
3 kV/mm so that if the air gap is correctly
adjusted a spark will close the RLC circuit once a volt-
6 kV is reached. The circuit will then

MHz [3]. At each oscillation a large percentage of the
power (of the order of 30%) will be lost due to emission
from the loop antenna, i.e.
in the generation of propa-
gating EM waves. These waves may then be recaptured
using a second loop antenna (RA) identical to the emit-
ting antenna A and with a series capacitor of the same
value as C. As a closing comment on the setup we note
that when using the 15 kV supply problems may arise
with the capacitor. Indeed the maximum voltage rating
for these is typically 15 kV or lower so that it is necessary
to use at least two in series (and another two in parallel
so as to maintain the same eﬀective capacitance). We
also had to insert the capacitors in a plastic bottle (ac-
tually a large-size soft-drink cup) ﬁlled with oil in order

example of an experimental V(t) trace obtained by mea-
suring the voltage diﬀerence on the capacitor with RA
placed at 1 m from A. A short build-up time is followed
by the expected exponential decrease yet the oscillation
does not follow a perfect cosine function. Indeed, by tak-
ing the Fourier transform of the V(t) trace we observe two
distinct frequency peaks at ν1 = 1.95 MHz and ν2 = 2.88
MHz, as shown in Fig.4. So the shape of the V(t) trace is
due to a beating between these two diﬀerent frequencies.
In Fig.3 we may also see that this beating dies out after
4 µs leaving a sinusoidal oscillation at ν′ = ν2. The
t
physical reason for this behaviour lies in the fact that
during the ﬁrst oscillations of the circuit a very large EM
ﬁeld is emitted. This is then captured by the receiving
antenna RA which may in turn re-emit thus modifying

antennas will couple. As the oscillations die away the
emitted ﬁeld becomes much smaller, returning the cir-
cuit to the ideal RLC state. We note that this behaviour

case a very similar beating between two slightly diﬀerent
oscillation frequencies is observed and is ascribed to the
periodical coupling back and forth of energy between the
primary and secondary coils. Indeed the apparatus de-
scribed here is similar in many aspects to the Tesla coil
with the emitting loop antenna playing the role of a the
Tesla primary and the receiving antenna that of the Tesla
secondary coil.
In fact here we are observing a splitting of the natu-
ral resonance frequency ν0 of the antennas into an up-
shifted and a down-shifted frequency, a very general phe-
nomena of coupled systems ranging from the hydrogen
molecule to coupled optical waveguide modes. The split
frequencies are related to the natural resonance frequency
through an adimensional coupling coeﬃcient, q [4]:

to avoid dielectric breakdown in the air gap between the
wires protruding from the capacitors in order to prevent
the latter from being burnt by the spark.
As a ﬁrst experiment it is possible to prove energy trans-
port in a very simple way by attaching a small light bulb
to the receiving antenna RA. This experiment is best per-
formed using the 15 kV transformer. By placing RA at
distance of the order of 1 m or slightly more it is possible
to light the bulb with a certain eﬃciency. Although the
light tends to ﬂicker we noted a great improvement and
a much better stability by using a spark switch divided
into two, i.e. we used three bolts in series so that a spark
was generated over the two separating air-gaps.
For a quantitative analysis of the EM emission we at-
tached RA to a digital oscilloscope (e.g. Tektronics TDS
1002) with which we were then able to download the ac-
quired data to a PC (note: do not keep any laptops or
LCD screens between or near the antennas). For the RLC

Using ν2 = 1.95 MHz and ν2 = 2.88 MHz as found from
Fig.4 we obtain ν0 = 2.28 MHz and q = 0.37. It is pos-
sible to double-check the ν0 value by simpling exciting
the antenna and capacitor (LC circuit) with a cosine sig-
nal at varying frequency and searching for the resonance
condition.

The ﬁrst term describes the beating the two oscillations
at ν1 and ν2. This beating term is weighed by an expo-
nential function that depends on t and is adjusted (with
the parameter k) so that at t
4 µs the second term
describing a simple oscillation at ν2 takes over. The best
ﬁt is shown as a solid line in Fig.3 and gives us R = 6.1
Ω and L = 4.9 µH. The value for L is in agreement with
results from a sweep-test performed with a signal genera-
tor whereas R also accounts for the energy loss mediated

by the antenna A.
Finally we note that it is not possible to easily repro-
duce all of Hertz’ results with this setup, in particular it
is not feasible to try measuring the wavelength. However,
on the contrary this apparatus is ideal for characterizing
the near ﬁeld decay rate (e.g. along the axis of the an-
tenna A) of the EM ﬁeld emitted from a loop antenna.
It is expected that the near ﬁeld (r
λ) should decay
much faster than in the far ﬁeld. In particular the mag-
netic ﬁeld should decay as 1/r3 and the electric ﬁeld as
1/r2. By removing RA and measuring the E and B ﬁelds
along the antenna axis using an EM ﬁeld meter (Wandell
& Goltermann) we obtain the results shown in Fig.5 ((a)
for the E-ﬁeld and (b) for the B ﬁeld). The dots show the
experimental data and the solid curves are the best ﬁt to
the predicted behaviour. As can be seen the data repro-
duce the 1/r2 and 1/r3 dependencies quite well. However
we note that it has been predicted that the E-ﬁeld goes
to zero for r = 0 whereas we ﬁnd that although there is a
certain deviation from the 1/r2 curve, E is still far from
null. This may be the result of an averaging eﬀect due
to the relatively large size of the meter sensor or maybe
(and most likely) due to spurious reﬂections and contri-
butions coming from the surrounding environment.
In conclusion we have demonstrated a modiﬁed version
of the original experiments performed by H. Hertz in
1888. The apparatus is relatively simple to construct but
nevertheless is able to give an insight into many physi-
cal mechanisms such as RLC circuit oscillation and fre-
quency splitting due the coupling between two resonant
modes. The same experiment used in a Physics labora-
tory class has proved to be an interesting way to intro-
duce students to the use of the Fourier transform and to
some physical concepts (such as energy splitting) that are
often treated within relatively more complex (and thus
more diﬃcult to study) contexts.

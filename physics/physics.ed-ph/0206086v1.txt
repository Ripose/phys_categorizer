A pedagogically instructive experimental procedure is sug-
gested for distinguishing between diﬀerent damping terms in a
weakly damped oscillator, which highlights the connection be-
tween non-linear damping and initial-amplitude dependence.
The most common damping terms such as contact friction, air
resistance, viscous drag, and electromagnetic damping have
velocity dependences of the form constant, v, or v2. The cor-
responding energy dependences of the form √E, E, or E√E
in the energy loss equation give rise to characteristic depen-
dence of the amplitude decay slope on the initial amplitude.

I. INTRODUCTION

The most commonly studied source of damping in os-
cillating systems is a resistive force Fres =
mv/τ pro-
portional to velocity, such as due to ﬂuid drag at very
low relative speed, when the Reynolds number R is of
the order 1 or less. The equation of motion involves a
linear diﬀerential equation of the type

which yields an exponential decay x0(t)/x0(0) = e−t/2τ
for the normalized amplitude of oscillations. The decay
is independent of the initial amplitude, a characteristic
of the linear nature of the system. Here x(t) refers to
the instantaneous displacement of a block in a spring-
mass oscillator or the angular displacement of a physical
pendulum.

For weakly damped oscillations, it is convenient to con-
sider the oscillator energy E averaged over one cycle,
during which period the amplitude x0(t) is nearly con-
stant. With x(t) = x0 sin ωt, we have E = mω2
0/2,
and the change in the oscillator energy over one cycle
is ∆E =
E T /τ . This yields the linear
energy loss equation

over long time scales compared to the oscillation time
period. The normalized energy E(t)/E(0) = e−t/τ also
decays exponentially, independently of the initial energy.
In most laboratory oscillators, however, non-linear
terms actually dominate in the energy loss equation. A
√E term results from the nearly velocity-independent
dry friction, for instance at the pivot of a physical pen-
dulum or due to a brake pad, whereas air resistance leads
to a E√E term as the Reynolds number is typically of
the order of 1000, in which regime the air resistance is

1

proportional to v2. Another potential contribution to the
energy loss equation arises from a centripetal correction
to the normal reaction at the pivot, and therefore to the
E,
friction. As the average centripetal force Fc ∝
this leads to a E√E correction to the contact friction
contribution in the energy loss equation.

In certain situations, even electromagnetic damping in
an oscillating system leads to a √E damping term, as re-
cently reported for a simple experimental setup involving
a magnet oscillating through a coil. [1] Similar damping
behavior is expected in an oscillating pendulum consist-
ing of a copper or aluminum disk, periodically passing be-
tween the pole pieces of two strong magnets placed near
the mean position, provided the conducting disk passes
through the magnetic ﬁeld in a very short time compared
to the oscillation time period. On the other hand, a con-
tinuously acting electromagnetic damping force, as on
a conducting spinning wheel placed between two strong
magnets, leads to a E damping term.

In practice, the oscillator energy loss is therefore typi-

cally described by the following non-linear equation

In this article we describe a quantitative study of the ex-
pected initial-condition dependence of the amplitude de-
cay due to the non-linear damping, and discuss a practi-
cal application of this initial-condition dependence. Even
though the diﬀerent damping terms have characteristic
decay signatures — a linear decay of amplitude with time
for √E damping, an exponential decay for E damping,
and an inverse power decay for E√E damping — a prac-
tical diﬃculty often encountered is how to distinguish
between several weak damping terms present simultane-
ously. Towards this end, we suggest a sensitive experi-
mental procedure for quantitatively identifying the sepa-
rate damping contributions in Eq. (3). Furthermore, as
this procedure requires only the initial amplitude decay
and not the full decay over long time, it is especially use-
ful in situations where very small oscillation amplitudes
cannot be reliably obtained.

Either separately, or in combination, the diﬀerent
damping terms have been considered in several earlier
studies. These include a harmonic oscillator with sliding
friction [2–4] and viscous force, [5] an oscillating sphere
with ﬂuid drag, [6] and a physical pendulum with air
resistance, [7–10] dry friction, [10] and electromagnetic
damping. [11,10]

passes through a coil (C) periodically, generating a series of
emf pulses.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

We have used a common laboratory setup for studying
electromagnetic induction to monitor the oscillation am-
plitude. An oscillating magnet passes through a coil peri-
odically, generating a series of electromotive force (emf)
pulses. In a practical realization of this concept, a rigid
semi-circular frame of aluminum, pivoted at the center
(O) of the circle (see Fig. 1) and free to oscillate in
its own plane about a horizontal axis through O, has a
rectangular bar magnet mounted at the center of the arc
passing through a coil C of suitable area of cross section.
A convenient way of monitoring the induced emf pulses,
and therefore the oscillation amplitude, is through a PC
interface, which can be readily realized by low-cost, con-
venient data-acquisition modules available in the market.
The amplitude can also be directly monitored by con-
necting the oscillator shaft to a precision potentiometer,
and recording the instantaneous voltages through a PC
interface. [10]

The

un-
derlying electromagnetic induction phenomenon in this
oscillating system has been discussed earlier. [1] The in-
duced emf is signiﬁcant only in a very narrow angular
range about the mean position, and if the angular am-
5◦), the angular velocity
plitude is not too small (θ0
of the bar magnet is very nearly constant in this narrow

As expected, the initial energy E(0) appears with both
the non-linear terms k and k′′, and hence both a and b
depend on the initial amplitude. More importantly, the
decay slope a depends on the damping constants k, k′,
and k′′, which implies that the linear part of the am-
plitude decay itself contains information about all the
damping terms.

A typical amplitude decay with time is shown in Fig.
2 for both the open- and short-circuit conﬁgurations. A
dominantly linear decay is seen in both cases, with a
deviation from linearity becoming pronounced at large
times.
In the open-circuit conﬁguration, the damping
is due to friction and air resistance. When the coil is
short-circuited (through a low resistance (220 Ω) so that
the emf pulses can be monitored by tapping the voltage
across the resistor), intermittent electromagnetic damp-
ing is activated due to the induced eddy current when
the magnet passes through the coil.

a = 117
linear decay rate a is signiﬁcantly larger in the short-
circuit case due to the additional contribution to k from
electromagnetic damping. From Eq. (9), we note that
the ratio b/a depends only on the air-resistance damp-
ing coeﬃcients k′ and k′′. If the electromagnetic damp-
ing only modiﬁes the k term, [1] then this ratio should
be indentical for both cases, provided the initial ampli-
tude is identical. The near doubling of this ratio in the
short-circuit case is therefore a clear indication that elec-
tromagnetic damping also introduces small E and E√E
damping terms which modify the quadratic coeﬃcient b.

IV. INITIAL-AMPLITUDE DEPENDENCE OF
THE DECAY SLOPE

Equation (9) shows that both k′ and k′′ contribute to
the coeﬃcient b of the quadratic term in Eq. (7). There-
fore, it is not possible to distinguish between the E and
E√E damping terms from the initial amplitude decay,
unless the dependence on the initial energy (amplitude)
is taken into account. The form of Eq.
(8) suggests
a pedagogically instructive experimental procedure for
identifying the signature of the weak damping terms k,
k′, and k′′ by studying the initial amplitude dependence.
If the amplitude decay is written as θ0(t) = θ0(0)

V. SUMMARY

Qualitatively diﬀerent damping terms can be distin-
guished from each other by studying the variation of
the amplitude decay slope with the initial amplitude. A
constant, linear, and quadratic dependence of the decay
slope on the initial amplitude are signatures of the E1/2,
E, and E3/2 damping terms, respectively. A quantitative
determination of the contributions of contact friction and
air resistance due to an attached vane is demonstrated.

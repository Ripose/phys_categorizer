Abstract

We develop a new method to determine the relative acceleration of a block sliding down along

the face of a moving wedge. We have been able to link the solution of this problem to that of

the inclined problem of elementary physics, thus providing a simpler solution to it.

Key words: Newton’s Laws, Constrained Systems, Relative Motion, Friction, Relative Ac-

celeration.

The problem of determining the relative motion of a block sliding down on the surface of a wedge

which is itself free to move along a frictionless horizontal plane [1, 2], as shown in Fig. 1, can be

resolved by relating it to two problems of elementary Physics having well-known solutions.

First suppose that the wedge is held fast and consider the problem of a mass sliding down along

the wedge’s surface. This problem is equivalent to the elementary problem of a mass sliding down

a frictionless inclined plane which makes an angle θ with the horizontal. The magnitude of the

acceleration am of the mass moving down along the wedge’s surface is thus ([3], p. 191)

am = g sin θ

(0.1)

Thus, when the acceleration of the wedge aM = 0, the block acquires am = g sin θ relative to the

wedge.

A slightly more sophisticated variant of the situation described above occurs when one wants to

ﬁnd out what acceleration should be imparted to the wedge in order to keep the block from sliding

down along the wedge’s surface. In this case, the normal force of reaction (N) of the wedge’s surface

on the block has a horizontal component which makes the block move along with the wedge with

acceleration aM . Thus N sin θ = maM . On the other hand, since there is no acceleration in the

vertical direction, we have N cos θ = mg. Eliminating N we obtain

aM = g tan θ

(0.2)

Thus, the block stays at rest (am = 0) relative to the wedge when aM = g tan θ.

The reader will note ([3], p. 501) that when a simple pendulum is suspended from the roof of a car

moving with acceleration aM the string hangs at an angle from the vertical which is given by (0.2).

The two solutions (am, aM ) = (g sin θ, 0) and (am, aM ) = (0, g tan θ) provide an easy way to deter-

mine relationship between the acceleration of the wedge and the acceleration of the block relative

to the wedge for any value of the acceleration imparted to the wedge, from zero to g tan θ, where

these extreme values correspond to the solutions of the two limiting cases discussed above. This

is so because the variation of am is directly proportional to the normal force of reaction N, which,

in turn, is also directly proportional to aM . Thus, the relationship between the accelerations is a

linear one, the pair of values (am, aM ) given above are two points on a straight line as shown in

Fig. 2.

From this ﬁgure we get the general relationship between the accelerations

am = g sin θ − aM cos θ.

(0.3)

Our point is that Eq. (0.3) also holds when the wedge moves solely under the weight of the sliding

block, without any external force imparting an acceleration to the wedge. In this case, the linear

momentum of the system (block and wedge) along the horizontal direction is conserved, that is:

p = (M + m)vM + mvm cos θ

(0.4)

where vM is the velocity of the wedge relative to the ﬂoor and vm is the velocity of the block relative

to the wedge.

Eq. (0.4) implies this second relationship between the acceleration:

(M + m)aM + mam cos θ = 0,

(0.5)

2

which is easily derived from the geometry of the system as in [4] and [5].

From (0.3) and (0.5) we solve the problem completely for aM and am [1]:

and

aM = −

mg sin θ cos θ
M + m sin2 θ

am =

(M + m)g sin θ
M + m sin2 θ

(0.6)

(0.7)

Even when there is friction between the block and the wedge an analogous relationship between the

accelerations can be easily obtained by the same reasoning we have developed before, with minor

changes to take friction into account.

Let µ be the coeﬃcient of friction between the block and the wedge. Suppose also that µ < tan θ.

When aM = 0 (the wedge is held fast again) the block acquires an acceleration ([7], p.72)

am = g(sin θ − µ cos θ)

(0.8)

along the surface of the wedge.

If block and wedge do not move relative to each other, diﬀerently from the previous analysis, we

have to consider two cases, according to whether the block is on the brink of moving upward or

downward along the wedge’s surface. We consider this latter situation, for which the balance of

forces is N(sin θ − µ cos θ) = maM in the horizontal direction, and N(cos θ + µ sin θ) = mg in the

vertical direction. Thus the block does not slide (am = 0) if the wedge’s acceleration is [6]

aM = g

sin θ − µ cos θ
sin θ + µ cos θ

.

(0.9)

The corresponding relationship between accelerations is again a linear one, as shown in Fig. 3,

from which we deduce that

am = g(sin θ − µ cos θ) − aM (cos θ + µ sin θ).

(0.10)

Note that Eq. (0.5) holds when friction is present as well. So from (0.5) and (0.10) we obtain (See

[7] and numerous examples on p. 86, 87 for a physical insight into the meaning of these solutions)

aM = −

mg cos2 θ(tan θ − µ)
M + m − m cos2 θ(1 + µ tan θ)

(0.11)

3

and

am =

(M + m)g cos θ(tan θ − µ)
M + m − m cos2 θ(1 + µ tan θ)

.

(0.12)

We leave it to the reader to justify our considering the situation in which the block is on the verge

of sliding downward along the wedge instead of upward.

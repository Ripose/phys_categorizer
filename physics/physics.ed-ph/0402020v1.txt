Abstract

The curve joining the points of maximum height in the parabolas of ideal projectile motion is

shown to be an ellipse. Some features of the motion are illustrated with the help of such ellipse.

In the last years several contributions have analysed the old but ever interesting problem

of the properties of projectile motion.1,2,3,4,5,6 In this note we want to pinpoint that an ellipse

is also related to the parabolas traced by projectiles launched in a constant ﬁeld. The ellipse

appears as the curve connecting the points of maximum height in the parabolas.

To obtain this little known fact, recall that the coordinates of projectiles launched from

the origin in the x–y plane with the same initial speed v0 but diﬀerent launching angles are

x = v0t cos α,

y = v0t sin α

where α is the launching angle. From these equations it is simple to obtain the time for

reaching the maximum height as tm = v0 sin α/g. Therefore, the coordinates of the projectile

at tm are

xm =

where ym is the maximum height attained and xm the corresponding horizontal coordinate.

It should be noted that the trajectories described by Eq.

(1) are symmetric respect to

the point (xm, ym) and so the range of a projectile launched at an angle α is R = 2xm =

0/g. With the help of the trigonometric identities 2 cos α sin α = sin 2α and

cos 2α, Eqs. (2) can be casted in the form

0/4g, i. e. a = 2b. Eq. (4) represents an ellipse

(4)

centered at point (0, b) with minor and major axes given, respectively, by 2b and 2a. The

eccentricity is e = √3/2 and does not depend on any details of the motion. See Fig. 1 for a

graph of the ellipse and of some of the projectile trajectories that generate it.

Discussing diﬀerent ways of obtaining a result may enhance student retention and un-

derstanding. To obtain (4) in another way, we can start from the gedanken experiment of

simultaneously ﬁring from the origin many projectiles with the same initial speed v0—e. g.
the case of an exploding ﬁrecracker.6 At any later time, t, the projectiles are on the curve

That is, the projectiles are located on an expanding and freely falling circle. To see it, take

the point of view of a free-falling frame where gravity vanishes7. In this frame the projectiles

are on a expanding circle of radius v0t—as can be derived from Eqs. (1) with g = 0. But

in the frame where gravity is acting, the center of mass is falling at a constant acceleration

g

= 0, hence it is located at (0,

gt2/2) and Eq. (5) follows. When we substitute the time

tm in this equation we obtain that the points of maximum height, (xm, ym), satisfy

To eliminate sin2 α from (6) we employ Eq. (3) and obtain Eq. (4) again. In fact, we can

do an identical calculation making not reference whatsoever to particles on a circle, since
the equation of the path of a single projectile in the falling frame is x′2 + y′2 = v2
0t2 —the

primed variables being coordinates in such frame.

Our ellipse also aﬀords yet another solution to the problem of maximizing the range in

projectile motion since the right vertex of it (see Fig. 1) corresponds precisely to such a case.

Can the ellipse (4) be characterized in any other way? It can be shown to be also the

locus of points where the radial ( ˙r) component of the velocity vanishes. Stablishing this

property can be a simple exercise in intermediate mechanics. It can also be proved that as

long as the downward branch (i. e.

the one in which ˙y < 0) of a projectile path is within

the ellipse then the projectile is necessarily approaching the origin otherwise it is getting

away from it.

FIG. 1: The ellipse of maximum heights associated with a family of parabolic trajectories launched

with the same initial speed (thick black curve). The center of the ellipse is at (0, b) and its

eccentricity is √3/2. The ten lighter curves are some of the projectile paths giving birth to it. The

gray curve is the parabolic envelope of the family of projectile trajectories. The numbers shown on

the right of the y-axis correspond to the launching angle of the nearest parabola. The symmetric

parabolas on the left correspond to projectiles launched with the same speed but complementary
angles. This plot makes apparent that the maximum range is reached for α = 45◦, i. e.

it

corresponds to the right vertex of the ellipse, and is Rm = 2a.

Abstract

An information theory version of the thermochapters in introductory physics

is outlined. By starting with number of accessible states, one ﬁnds natural

physical units for entropy (nats or bits) and temperature (energy per unit in-

formation), along with separate positive/negative absolute zeros (or inﬁnities

in reciprocal temperature). A general and quantitative version of the Zeroeth

Law allows one to derive equipartition, the ideal gas law, and the law of mass

action where they apply, and show that speciﬁc heats and degrees freedom

measure the bits of uncertainty increase per two-fold increase in thermal en-

ergy per particle. The role of heat engines (esp. autotrophs) in biological

energy ﬂow as well as in motors and heat pumps is discussed. Entropy loses

its extensive character with consideration of correlation information, which al-

lows one to deﬁne information engines that extend the role of heat engines in

biology. Finally, the complementary role of codes and excitations is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The following are part of a collection of notes which have been evolving, partly in the

context of classroom experiences teaching statistical physics, modern physics, and introduc-

tory physics. More of the notes in hand will be added to this collection as time permits.

II. IDEAL GAS: AN INFORMATION PHYSICS VIEW

We introduce with this example a number of concepts. The ﬁrst is the number of ac-

cessible states Ω given what you know about other stuﬀ, e.g. the energy and volume and

number of particles. For an ideal gas in a cubical box of side L, quantum mechanics (e.g.

Schroedinger’s equation for particles in a 3D inﬁnitely-deep square well) says that the veloc-

ities of each particle are integral multiples of some base velocity vo = h

2mL where h is Planck’s

constant and m is the particle mass. One can hence imagine a 3-dimensional “state space”

for each particle, where total energy of particle i is simply Ei = εo(n2

xi + n2

yi + n2

zi). Here

the nji for j = x, y, z are positive non-zero integers, and εo ≡
22.4 liter cube (L = 28cm), the base velocity vo is 17.6nm/sec. The base energy εo is only

o. For Argon atoms in a

One can further imagine a 3N-dimensional state space for all N particles, where total

energy is E =

Ei = εo

n2
ji. Ways to partition energy of thermal motion among N

particles are thus represented by the set of integer-spaced points in this 3N-dimensional

state space, one for each diﬀerent set of nji values where i = 1, N and j = x, y, z.

We can think of the set of states in the energy range E

δE

integer-packed points in the positive quadrant of a 3N-dimensional spherical shell centered

on the origin. By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance R of a point from the origin in

that space obeys R2

This equation takes a bit getting used to, especially if you’ve never seen half-integer fac-

torials. For example, when M = 2 dimensions, this equation says that A[R, 2] is 2πR, as

one might expect since the 1D surface area of a 2D circle is just the circumference. But
for M = 3 dimensions, A[R, 3] becomes 2 π3/2

! R2 when one might have expected the familiar
expression for a sphere’s surface area, namely 4πR2. Strangely, these two expressions agree,

The quantum concentration η is simply related to the thermal deBroglie wavelength λT ,

a function of temperature and particle mass which represents the “wave packet” size of

the average particle in the gas. In fact, η = 1/λ3

T , so one can think of η as the number

of quantum states at a given temperature which ﬁt without overlapping per unit volume.

When the gas particles lose kinetic energy, their wavepackets and λT get larger. For atoms

in the Argon gas above, λT is about one sixth of an Angstrom, still smaller than the size of a

stationary atom. The quantum concentration η thus shrinks. When η becomes comparable

in size to the actual concentration ρ, the particles themselves overlap, and new quantum

mechanical eﬀects begin to modify the behavior of the gas. Ideal gases are by deﬁnition

hotter, and or less concentrated, than this.

Once you have an expression for the number of accessible states given information on E,

V , and N, lots of stuﬀ can be calculated. For example, the entropy (or physical information

uncertainty) about the state of the system is then

Caution here, as some dependences on E, V , and N are hidden in the expressions for η and

Derivatives of the entropy are even more informative. For example, the derivative

with respect to energy gives coldness (reciprocal temperature) β and the equipartition law.

Rearranging this yields the equipartition law (good for all “quadratic systems”), namely:

where ν (the number of “degrees of freedom per particle”) is 3 for the three independent

components of velocity of an ideal gas particle in which thermal kinetic energy can be

stored. For anything at room temperature, coldness β is around 40nats/eV, and the energy

per monatomic ideal gas particle is E

N = 0.038eV.

The derivative with respect to volume gives the free expansion coeﬃcient γ and the

equation of state. Speciﬁcally,

aﬃnities of reactants on both sides are equal, i.e. when

where the ﬁrst term depends only on reactant concentrations, while the last term is a function

only of temperature and particle masses. Thus the behavior of the equilibrium constant as

a function of temperature may be predicted. Moreover, for ideal gases it is not a function

of pressure as long as temperature is held constant! For argon atoms in the gas above, the

aﬃnity is α

16nats/particle, and the chemical potential µ is around

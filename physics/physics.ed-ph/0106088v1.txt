Introducing Time Dependence into the Static Maxwell Equations

Avraham Gal

(January 8, 2014)

Using to a minimum extent special relativity input, and relying on the
Lorentz-force expression for the force acting on a charged particle in motion
under the inﬂuence of electric (E) and magnetic (B) ﬁelds, the Maxwell curl
equations are shown to follow from the covariance of the two Maxwell diver-
gence equations ∇ · E = 4πρ and ∇ · B = 0.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Maxwell equations in vacuum provide the theoretical framework for studying elec-
tromagnetism. Most of the undergraduate introductory-physics textbooks on Electricity and
Magnetism (EM) start by introducing the basic observations made, prior to Maxwell, re-
garding electric charges and currents. The Maxwell equations are then ‘derived’ by unifying
these observations into physical laws governing the space- and time evolution of the electric
ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld B (for a non exhaustive list of representative textbooks, see
Refs. [1–6]). The equations which one usually ﬁnds easier to motivate than others are the
two divergence equations

and

Eq.
sources, where ρ is the charge density. Eq. (2), for the magnetic ﬁeld B, expresses the non
observation, and consequently the non existence of magnetic charges. One then proceeds
to explain how magnetism is generated by currents rather than by charges, resulting in the
magnetic-ﬁeld Maxwell curl equation

whereas the electric ﬁeld is curl free:

The constant c in Eq. (3) is the speed of light in vacuum. Equations (3) and (4) apply to
static situations, where any time variation of the underlying charge density ρ and current
density J, and hence of E and B respectively, is excluded. Allowing for time dependence,
the above Maxwell curl equations become

∇ · E = 4πρ ,

∇ · B = 0 .

However, it turns out to be more problematic, and certainly less transparent, to motivate
Eqs. (5,6) by the appropriate phenomena, e.g. adding the displacement current for ‘deriving’
Eq. (5) and electromagnetic induction experiments for ‘deriving’ Eq. (6). In particular,
Galili and collaborators [7–9] have recently drawn attention to the subtleties involved in
relating Faraday’s law to Maxwell’s equation (6).

The purpose of this note is to show that one may derive Eqs. (5,6) directly from Eqs. (1,2)
using a minimum input of EM (the Lorentz force) and special relativity physics material
that is within the scope of normal electromagnetism curriculum, by requiring that Eqs.
(1,2), due to charge conservation, hold in any inertial coordinate frame. Speciﬁcally, we
will require (i) a knowledge of and familiarity with the Lorentz force acting on a charge
q moving at an instantaneous velocity v; and (ii) a knowledge of what a Lorentz four
vector means, particularly for space-time (r, ct) and for momentum-energy (p, E/c), but
also for the current-charge density four vector (J, cρ), in terms of a Lorentz boost from one
inertial frame to any other inertial one. Once the Maxwell equations (5,6) are derived from
(1,2), the physics contents and phenomenology of these former equations can be easily and
systematically unfolded within a regular undergraduate introductory physics course.

II. AUXILIARY MATERIAL

A. Lorentz transformation

A boost with velocity V is applied in the x (longitudinal) direction, without aﬀecting

the y, z transverse directions:

x′ = γ(x − βct) ,

ct′ = γ(ct − βx) ,

where β = V /c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2. From (7) one shows that the derivatives transform as
follows:

∂
∂x′ = γ

.

The Lorentz transformation rule (7) applies also to the four momentum (p, E/c) and to the
four current density (J, cρ). In particular, for the latter one:

J ′
x = γ (Jx − βcρ) ,

cρ′ = γ (cρ − βJx) .

In order to motivate the (perhaps less familiar) transformation rule (9), one recalls the
continuity equation

(10)

which is usually taught within the context of charge conservation in EM courses [1] and
which can be written in a covariant form ∂µJ µ = 0, implying that J µ (µ = 1, 2, 3, 4) is a
four vector.

In many respects, Eq. (11) may be regarded as the operational deﬁnition of the electro-
magnetic ﬁelds [1]. Below, we will use this Lorentz-force expression in order to determine
the Lorentz transformation properties of E and B. A caveat of the present approach, as
generally is the case when relying on Eq. (11), is that the constant c is the same speed of
light constant as the one appearing in the Lorentz transformation (7).

C. Transformation properties of E and B

It is shown in the Appendix that the form of the Lorentz force, Eq. (11), leads to the
following Lorentz transformation properties of the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld B:

x = Ex , E′

z = γ (Bz − βEy) .

III. THE MAXWELL EQUATIONS

(11)

(12)

(13)

Here we show, using the auxiliary material of Sect. II, how the Maxwell equation (1)
leads to the Maxwell equation (5), and how the Maxwell equation (2) leads to the Maxwell
equation (6). The key assumption is that the laws of electromagnetism expressed by Eqs.
(1) and (2) (essentially charge conservation) have the same form in any inertial frame of
reference. We start with Eq. (1) in the primed coordinate system,

∇′ · E′

′
= 4πρ

,

(14)

and express the primed quantities in terms of the unprimed ones, using Eqs. (8,9,12). One
obtains:

Identifying the terms on the l.h.s. which combine to γ∇ · E, and on the r.h.s. the term
γ4πρ, we make use of Eq. (1) in the unprimed coordinate system to cancel out these terms,
resulting in

It is worth noting that applying the divergence operation to both sides of the Maxwell
equation (18) which we herewith proved starting from the Maxwell equation (1), and making
use of the latter, one immediately recovers the continuity equation (10) which provides the
full (non static) content of the underlying assumption of charge conservation.

Similarly, starting with Eq. (2) in the primed coordinate system,

∇′ · B′ = 0 ,

and expressing the primed quantities in terms of the unprimed ones using Eqs. (8,13), one
obtains:

γ

The terms on the l.h.s. combining to γ∇ · B give rise to zero by Eq. (2), while the remaining
terms lead to

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have shown that accepting the Lorentz force, plus a minimal amount of special
relativity material, it becomes possible to derive each of the (vector) Maxwell curl equations
(5,6) from one of the (scalar) Maxwell divergence equations (1,2), respectively. This suggests
a more economical way of getting into the uniﬁed framework of the Maxwell equations than
is done in most of the other approaches of teaching an introductory EM course. In order to
understand how come, on two separate occasions, one divergence equation gives rise to three
equations which are combined into a curl equation, we note that the Maxwell equations (1)
and (5) can be lumped covariantly together into the form

where F αβ is the 4 × 4 antisymmetric ﬁeld tensor and the greek indices run over the four
space-time components [10,11]. J α is the current density four vector, see Eq. (9). If the
form (23) is satisﬁed for one of these four-vector components α, by covariance it is also
satisﬁed for the other ones, since no direction in the four dimensional space has preference
over the other ones. Eq. (1) corresponds to the time-like component, whereas the vector
Eq. (5) corresponds to the three space-like components. A corollary of Eq. (23), due to the
antisymmetry of F αβ, is the continuity equation (10), in agreement with the discussion in
Sect. III following Eq. (18).

Similarly, the Maxwell equations (2) and (6) can be lumped covariantly together into the

form

εαβγδ ∂Fγδ

∂xβ = 0 ,

(24)

where εαβγδ is the fully antisymmetric unit tensor in four dimensions [10,11]. Eq.
corresponds to the time-like component, whereas the vector Eq.
three space-like components.

(6) corresponds to the

Obviously, if students were familiar with the antisymmetric ﬁeld tensor F µν, and once
Eqs. (1,2) are shown to be equivalently written as the time-like components of Eqs. (23, 24)
respectively, then it would have been straightforward to argue for the validity of Eqs. (5,6)
respectively, using only the argument of Lorentz covariance. However, since most introduc-
tory EM courses do not introduce F µν, the right thing to do in such a case would be to
follow the explicit construction outlined in the present note which emphasizes the frame
independence of charge conservation.

APPENDIX: DERIVATION OF EQS. (12, 13) FOR BOOSTING E AND B

Let K denote the laboratory coordinate frame, where a charged particle (charge q) moves
with an instantaneous velocity v which deﬁnes the x axis. The Lorentz force acting on it is
given by

where E and B are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Deﬁne the instantaneous rest frame of
the particle, where

The frame K ′ moves with velocity V = v with respect to K. We assume a knowledge of the
force transformation law which is derived by making use how the momentum p and time t
transform and recalling that F = dp/dt. Thus, F ′

Eqs. (27-29) give E′ in terms of E and B, coinciding with Eq. (12) of the main text.

In order to proceed with the derivation of Eq. (13) for B′ in terms of E and B, we
invert Eq. (28) by noting that interchanging unprimed and primed quantities amounts to
just changing the sign of β:

Ey = γ(E′

y + βB′

z) .

Substituting E′

y from Eq. (28), one gets

Ey = γ [γ(Ey − βBz) + βB′

z] ,

and since (1 − γ2) = −β2γ2, the ﬁnal outcome is

Manipulating similarly on Eq. (29), one gets

B′

z = γ (Bz − βEy) .

B′

y = γ (By + βEz) .

Eqs. (32-33) for the transverse components of B agree with the corresponding expressions in
Eq. (13). Further arguments have to be invoked for showing that B′
x = Bx, thus completing
the derivation of Eq. (13). To spare a technically more complicated procedure, we note that
the transverse components of B in Eq. (13) are obtained from those of E in Eq. (12) by
interchanging E and B plus reversing the sign of β. Equation (27) above for the longitudinal
component of E, namely E′
x = Ex, then suggests a similar rule B′
x = Bx for the longitudinal
component of B.
It is useful to record at this stage, as follows from Eqs. (12,13), that
E · B and E2 − B2 are invariant under Lorentz transformations [11], leaving however the
demonstration of it to a later stage of the curriculum.

Abstract

We discuss the interchangeability of the thermodynamic limit β

This note deals with thermodynamic limits with respect of parameters in certain thermodynamic

functions of model Hamiltonians given by a sum of non-commuting operators H = H0 + V . The

ﬁrst parameter is the inverse temperature β that appears, for instance, in the deﬁnition of the free

energy

where Z is the partition function of a particular model considered.

It is sometimes advantageous to write the partition function of quantum models in the Trotter

representation by the use of the Trotter formula (for pair of operators limited from below)

This representation is specially useful in quantum mechanics since the operators H0 and V will

not in general commute, and one will not be allowed to decompose the exponential operator into a

product of exponentials. The Trotter formula achieves this at the expense of formally transforming

parameter n introduced, so that the ratio β/n plays the role of a lattice spacing in the extra

”temperature” direction [0, β]. This involves taking another limit in the free energy function

where T r T n is the trace of the nth power of transfer matrix T .

The order of the limits in (3) can not in general be interchanged. It is not always clear whether

it is possible to interchange the limits even in simple problems and an analysis of its validity is

beyond our scope here.

We want to point out that n and β always appear as a single variable in the ratio β/n throughout

the calculation and the question of the order of the limits is relevant only at the end, when the

eﬀect of letting n

ﬁrst deﬁnitely manifests itself.

In order to illustrate the role played by the parameters β and n in the thermodynamic functions

and see how the n-to-inﬁnity-ﬁrst limit imposes itself when interchangeability fails it suﬃces to

consider the free energy of a simple spin model Hamiltonian H = σz + λσx, where λ is a constant

and σz and σx are the usual Pauli spin matrices

For this model, a direct evaluation of the partition function Z = T re−

βH in (1) is available since

the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are E

=

√1 + λ2. Thus the trace can be written as a

sum over the energy eigenstates Z = e−

βE+. The analysis is facilitated when we write

Z = e−

βE−(1 + e−

the lower eigenvalue term dominates, and

The Trotter formula approach to this problem consists in applying (2) to the partition function

of the model. This leads to the transfer matrix formalism in which the partition function reads

Although so far β and n have always appeared together as the ratio β/n, from this point on we will

see that in order to obtain the correct asymptotic value (4) we have to let n

The above considerations stem from the author’s tentative to solve an open problem in statistical

mechanics. This is the problem of proving the existence of a Kosterlitz–Thouless phase in the ground

state (β

) of a one-dimensional array of quantum rotators (See [1] for a deﬁnition of the model

→ ∞

and some results towards this proof). One apparent very natural approach to this problem consists

in using the Trotter representation to map the one-dimensional quantum rotator system into a

two-dimensional classical system in the form we have stated above. Since a Kosterlitz–Thouless

phase has already been proven for the two-dimensional classical rotator [2], it is a generally held

opinion that the quantum rotators also exhibit this transition, but the proof is still missing.

Abstract

Two simple, interpolatory-like linearizations are shown for the simple pen-

dulum which can be used for any initial amplitude.

Key words: pendulum, linearization.

A commonplace approximation when teaching the motion of a simple

pendulum is to assume a small initial amplitude, so that the equation of

motion can be safely approximated with the one corresponding to a harmonic

oscillator, leading to an amplitude-free period. If one wishes to consider the

case of not necessarily small initial amplitudes one is obliged to use the

full formula for the period of the pendulum, involving an elliptic integral or

its perturbation series1 or numerical methods.

I describe below, a simple

way around this diﬃculty that allows one to obtain an amplitude-dependent

period for the pendulum that can be used for any initial amplitude.

Let us consider a simple pendulum of length l in a (uniform) gravitational

ﬁeld g. The equation of motion is

d2Θ
dt2 = −

g
l (cid:19)

(cid:18)

sin(Θ)

If the initial amplitude is small, we can approximate sin(Θ) by Θ (lineariza-

tion), which leads to the approximate equation (d2Θ/dt2) = −(g/l)Θ, i.e.,

the harmonic oscillator equation with period T0 = 2π

l/g. What we want

to do is to extend this linearization procedure in such a way as to be able

q

to use it even at large initial amplitudes. To do that, we have to replace the

sin(Θ) term by something of the form F (Θ0)Θ, where F (Θ0) is an amplitude-

dependent coeﬃcient. This term will compensate for the fact that the force

is not really linear in Θ. Thus, for small initial amplitudes where the usual

linearization is valid, F (Θ0) ≈ 1, while for amplitudes near π, where the force

on the pendulum is small, F (Θ0) ≈ 0. In addition, F (Θ0) must be even in

Θ0 since by symmetry, the period of the pendulum can only depend on the

magnitude of the initial amplitude, |Θ0|. A simple F (θ0) that obeys these

requirements is

F (Θ0) =

sin(Θ0)

α

 

Θ0 !

where α is a number to be chosen judiciously (see below). With the above,

the equation of motion is

d2Θ
dt2 +

l (cid:19)  

(cid:18)

sin(Θ0)

Θ0 !

Θ = 0

and leads to a period T = T0(Θ0/ sin(Θ0))α/2, The parameter α can be

chosen in a variety of ways. We can, for instance, impose that the main cor-

rective term in the low-amplitude expansion of T, coincide with the leading

corrective term for the exact period1:

Texact = (2/π) T0

π/2

0
Z

dφ
(1 − k2 sin(φ)2)1/2

with k = sin(Θ0/2). For small Θ0, we have

Texact = T0(1 + (1/16)Θ2

0 + ...)

On the other hand, in our scheme we have

T = T0(1 + (α/12)Θ2

0 + ...)

Comparison of Eqs.(5) and (6) determines α = 3/4, and T becomes

also satisfy our requirements and leads to a period

which, in the low amplitude limit, coincides with Eq.(5), although its ﬁt over

all the angular range is not as good as with the ﬁrst choice, Eq.(2).

Figure 1 shows a comparison between the periods for the exact case,

Eq.(4), the main perturbative correction to the low-amplitude case, Eq.(5)

and our two interpolatory approximations, Eqs.(7) and (9). The agree-

ment using the interpolation scheme is quite satisfactory, remaining at Θ =

2 (114.60) within 1% and 4% from the exact values for interpolations (7) and

(9), respectively.

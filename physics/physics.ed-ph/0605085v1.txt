Abstract. A group of high school students (XII Liceum) in the framework of
the Roland Maze Project has built a compact telescope of three Geiger-M¨uller
counters. The connection between the telescope and PC computer was also created and
programed by students involved in the Project. This has allowed students to use their
equipment to perform serious scientiﬁc measurements concerning the single cosmic ray
muon ﬂux at ground level and below. These measurements were then analyzed with
the programs based on the ’nowadays’ knowledge on statistics. An overview of the
apparatus, methods and results were presented at several students conferences and
recently won the ﬁrst prize in a national competition of high school students scientiﬁc
work. The telescope itself, in spite of its ’scientiﬁc’ purposes, is built in such a way
that it is hung on a wall in a school physics lab and counts muons continuously. This
can help to raise the interest for studying physics among others. At present a few
(3) groups of young participants of the Roland Maze Project have already built their
own telescopes for their schools and some others are working on it. This work is a
perfect example of what can be done by young people when respective opportunities
are created by more experienced researchers and a little help and advice is given.

1. Introduction

1.1. Cosmic rays

Cosmic Rays (CR) were discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess (Nobel Price in 1936). In
his balloon ﬂights he found an increase of the discharge rate of an electroscope with
the height of the balloon. The nature of CR remained a mystery for quite a long time.
At present it is known that the radiation which we see deep in the atmosphere is not
the primary cosmic rays which enter from space. The former consists mostly of stable
nuclei (including single protons), and also in small fraction electron and photons - the
only elementary particles which could survive the journey from CR sources to the Earth
(one can also mention neutrinos, but, interacting only weakly, they can hardly be seen).
Protons (and neutrons trapped as nucleons in CR nuclei) interacting kilometers above
ground with nuclei of the atmosphere create, if the energy is high enough, short lived
elementary particles - mostly pions. These light mesons were discovered in the cosmic
radiation by C.F. Powell at Bristol and P.M.S. Blackett at Manchester in 1947. Blackett
was awarded the Nobel Physics Prize in 1948 and Powell in 1950.

Neutral pions decay almost immediately to high energy gamma quanta (photons).
High energy photons colliding with atomic nuclei can create a pair of electrons and
positrons. The positron is the antiparticle of the electron and was predicted theoretically
in 1928 by P.A.M. Dirac (Nobel price in 1933).
It was discovered in cosmic rays
by C.D. Anderson in 1932 – Nobel prize 1936 (shared with V. Hess). Electrons and
positrons interacting with charged nuclei produced so-called brehmstrahlung photons,
which in turn can create pairs etc. Sometimes, when the energy of the primary CR
particle is very high, electrons, positrons and photons in the form of a cascade can reach
ground level.

Charged pions can further interact strongly, creating several generations of
secondary particles, but sometimes, especially when the density of nuclei to interact
with is small (very high in the atmosphere), they decay. One of the products of pion
decay is the muon. The muon is the lepton of the second generation in the Standard
Model, and as such it behaves exactly like an electron The only diﬀerence is its mass.
The muon is more massive than the electron (∼200 times). The muon was discovered in
1937 in cosmic rays. A number of famous scientists had to work hard, before eventually
the true nature of the muon was established and I.I. Rabi could conclude the muon
discovery with his famous ”Who ordered that?”. C.D. Anderson and S.H. Neddermayer
(1937), J.C. Street and E.C. Stevenson (1937), F. Rassetti, B. Rossi and N. Nerson,
Chaminade, A. Freon and R. Maze (1939), S. Tomonaga and G. Araki (1940) all worked
on the problem.

The “Heavy electron” – the muon - interacts electromagnetically, and because it
is more massive, it is harder to disturb its motion. When it is moving very fast, it
is much harder to force it to emit brehmstrahlung photons. A high energy muon can
easily travel not only the whole atmosphere, from the point of origin to the Earth’s
surface, but also concrete walls and ﬂoors. This property of the muon makes it the most

abundant particle in the cosmic ray ﬂux at ground level. About 200 CR particles cross
each square meter area every second and about 3/4 of them are muons.

The electroscopes used in the pioneering years of cosmic ray physics were soon
replaced by more sophisticated equipment: cloud chambers and Geiger-M¨uller counters.
The ﬁrst allows one to photograph tracks left by electrically charged particles in
overcooled clouds. The second gives an electric signal to any kind of electronic register.
The simplicity of the Geiger-M¨uller (GM) counter makes it very useful not only for
scientiﬁc purposes. The GM counters have been extensively used by astronauts to
explore other planets in early s.f. movies, and even by James Bond in his ﬁrst movie
appearance in ”Doctor No”[1].

The GM counters used by B. Rossi around 1930 worked in a coincidence mode
made by three electronic valves[2]. This signiﬁcant electronic achievement of its times
is shown in Fig. 1.

1.2. The Roland Maze Project

The mentioned cascade of elementary particles (photons, electrons, positrons, muons,
pions and other hadrons, e.g. kaons discovered in 1947 by G. D. Rochester and C. C.
Butler in cloud chamber photographs of cosmic ray-induced events) reach the ground
level in the form of a thin (few meters) disc of a radius of hundreds of meters. Such
a phenomenon is called an Extensive Air Shower. Extensive Air Showers (EAS) were
seen for the ﬁrst time by Roland Maze with an apparatus built by him on the roof of
the `Ecole Normale Sup´erieure in Paris. It consisted of three sets of GM counters (each
of area about 10×10 cm2) working in diﬀerent coincidence modes. In 1938, R. Maze
and P. Auger announced the discovery of huge cascades of charged particles (EAS)[3].
The CR particles initiating such phenomena have to have enormous energies, milions
and even billions times greater than ‘usual’ resulting from radioactive decays and other
known-in- those days nuclear reactions.

Cosmic ray studies have been recently intensively developed, especially in the region
of the upper limit of the energy spectrum, where several events involving cosmic ray

Telescope of Geiger-M¨uller counters

particles with energy exceeding 1020 eV (≈ 50 J) have been observed. Their existence is a
very serious physical problem. It was number 4 on the additional problem list published
in 2005 in the Science magazine [4]: Where do ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays come from?
Above a certain energy, cosmic rays don’t travel very far before being destroyed. So why
are cosmic-ray hunters spotting such rays with no obvious source within our galaxy?

The experimental setup for recording such events usually consists of a number
of relatively simple particle detectors spread over a large area. Nowadays, the single
detector is a scintillation (or Cerenkov) counter connected to the electronic system with
a coincidence trigger and converters of time and amplitude of a signals to digital codes.
The essence of large area experiments is a method of synchronization and communication
between detectors and a system of collecting and storing the data.

This is the point where high school education can meet high science. It is hard
to imagine another subject of such great importance which can be studied jointly by
scientists and students. It is not surprising that at present there are related projects
under constructions in the USA [5] and in Europe[6].

One of them is the Roland Maze Project[7]. The proposed EAS detection stations

would be placed in the buildings of high schools.

The detection system of one station (school) allows one to conduct (in parallel with
the main scientiﬁc object of the project: studies of extremely high energy cosmic rays)
independent observations and studies for each group participating in the project.
It
covers the whole, wide region of cosmic ray particle energies, giving the ability to study
geophysics and atmospheric phenomena as well as monitoring the Sun’s activity and
space weather from one side, up to the properties of typical EAS on the other.

We have gathered many students interested in making ”big physics”. The
constructions of the project detectors and all the systems is going on, but in spite
of that in order not to lose the initial impact we have proposed to the students many
other activities.

2. Telescope of Geiger-M¨uller counters

One of the many byproducts of the Roland Maze Project is the idea of making
small cosmic ray detectors/counters which can be hung on the school wall showing
to everybody that cosmic rays are everywhere and raising the interest in science in
general.

The counters are arranged in telescopes of three Geiger-M¨uller counters working in

coincidence. Such a setup reminds us of the very ﬁrst array of Maze.

The telescopes are to be built entirely by groups of students from each school. The
only parts which can’t be made by them are GM counters, which are made in the A.
So ltan Institute for Nuclear Studies in  L´od´z. The counters are of glass with external
cathodes. This kind of GM counters is called the Maze type[8]. The electronic schemes
of the particular circuits are also to some extent created by the students, especially if
there is one in the group with some electronic experience. If there is none, a general

scheme is given and the particular solutions are then found empirically. This leads to
breaking some electronic components, but eventually it leads to great satisfaction which
is one of the more important factors when doing science and what is hard to explain to
the students in any other way.

2.1. A Particular solution

The telescope from which results we want to present in this paper was made by students
of the XII Liceum in  L´od´z.

A schematic view of the telescope is shown in Fig. 2.
The high voltage of about 1500 V needed to supply the GM tubes is created by
a modiﬁed TV HV transformer with a primary winding connected to a simple pulse
generator of 5-12 V and secondary to the Villard cascade. The coincidence was realized
with standard TTL monostables with duration time of about 2 µs. The 4-digits 7
segment display of about 1 inch height was used to show the number of counts.

The telescope was equipped with a simple interface built on a base of the 555 circuit
used to connect it to the PC class computer. The interface was originally programed
under DOS in BASIC. The computer is able to continuously register telescope counts
and to write them successively on the computer disk.

3. Results

3.1. Stability

In Fig. 3 we show the number of counts registered every hour since the beginning of 2006
to the end of January. As is seen there are no abrupt (unexpected, as will be discussed
later) changes, and this causes us to state that the telescope is working properly and
rather stable.

pressure (dashed line and right scale) registered in January 2006.

3.2. Barometric coeﬃcient

The single muon ﬂux changes with time, as has been known for a long time. The most
pronounced modulation relates to the atmospheric pressure. Low energy (∼GeV) muons
originate in the upper levels of the atmosphere and have to traverse almost the whole
atmosphere (hundreds grams per cm2 of air). The amount of the air above us changes
continuously. These changes are the subject of interest to billions of people around the
world. They are presented several times every day in TV weather reports on most of the
TV channels as values of the atmospheric pressure. The pressure of 1000 mb informs us
that above every square centimeter there is about 1 kg of air.

If the atmospheric layer to traverse is thicker then the ﬂux of muons is diminished,
due mainly to energy losses. Thus an anticorrelation of telescope counting rate
and atmospheric pressure is expected. The values of the pressure from the local
meteorological station Lublinek were taken from the respective web page and they are
plotted in Fig. 3. Fortunately, according the very rapid and substantial changes of the
pressure in January, the anticorrelation is clearly seen by the naked eye.

To study it in detail in Fig. 4 we show the scatter plot of telescope counting rate
vs. atmospheric pressure. The dashed line plotted there is the best linear ﬁt. To relate
our result with the one known from literature we can expressed it as a relative change
of the counting rate with respect to the increase of the pressure of 1 mb. Such a value
is called barometric coeﬃcient. Our result is -0.21±0.04%/mb.

3.3. Muon absorption in the ground

The  L´od´z EAS array of the A. So ltan Institute for Nuclear Studies has its detection
point in the underground laboratory placed 15 m below ground level. At present it is
used as the site of the prototype of the  L´od´z ”space weather station”. The students’
GM telescope was placed there and it measured the single muon ﬂux for a few days.
The results are shown in Fig. 5

Calculations show that muons which are able to reach the underground lab have to

have energy greater than about 5 GeV. The measured decrease of the muon ﬂux agrees
with the value expected from the known integral energy spectrum.

4. Discussion

4.1. The Main results

The telescope made by the high school students, operating for one month, produced data
which allowed students to determine precisely the value of the barometric coeﬃcient as
-0.21±0.04%/mb. This value is just what can be expected from the literature (-0.18 to
-0.20%/mb.) conﬁrming the principles of the methods and solutions used.

It is interesting to mention the work of an Italian group Ref.[9]. The general idea was
similar - to study the barometric eﬀect with the help of simple computerized apparatus
based on one small GM counter. Comparison shows that the results obtained by them
-0.051±0.015 (or even -0.023±0.009, based on 3.5 months of running the experiment)
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from ours. The simple explanation of this diﬀerence is that the
coincidence of three GM counters used by us warrant that the counts we registered are
deﬁnitively particles crossing areas of our GMs, and taking into account the thickness
of the GM counter walls they have to be mostly cosmic ray generated muons. Without
such a coincidence the single GM counter is measuring any kind of radiation which can
penetrate the active GM counter volume. Only a fraction of it depends on atmospheric
pressure.

The known ﬂux of vertical muons given by PDG [10] gives the expected counting
rate, and after simple geometrical integration we checked that it is consistent with our
measured value (shown in Fig. 2).

4.2. Signiﬁcant achievements

The value of the barometric coeﬃcient itself, in spite of its correctness, is not the most
important achievement of the present work. Several points have to be emphasized:

- students (K.K., R.P., and R.S.) designed the scientiﬁc instrument;

- students built it, checking, correcting and testing every part of it;

- students assembled all the parts together making the fully operational apparatus;

- students performed the measurements;

- students wrote the analysis programs and analyzed the data;

- students presented their achievements on several occasions (starting from a
presentation given by them in a forum of their own class, presentation in Lodz
high school competition on physics, presentation on ”3rmrd Roland Maze Scientiﬁc
Session”, and recently in the competition of national scientiﬁc works for high school
students organized by the Polish Academy of Science and INS, where they won The
First Prize).

Telescope of Geiger-M¨uller counters

The role of more experienced scientists (e.g. T.W.) participating in the telescope work
should also be expressed precisely to avoid any suspicions (as we noticed on a few
occasions). First and obvious is to formulate the subject of investigation. Then the
subject has to be introduced to the students in the way attractive enough to mobilize
young people to get the job. Some help in electronics was of course needed. Speciﬁc
questions concerning usage of elements to build up properly working circuits can be
mostly answered with the help of the internet. Some personal help and assistance was
necessary, of course, when testing built parts and assembling the telescope.

The construction process takes time, of course. For this particular telescope this
time was approximately one year. Students worked on the telescope in their free time,
mainly on Saturdays, when they spent their time without any collision with school
duties. During this year students gathered not only abilities of making electronic devices,
but in the meantime they improved their knowledge also of physics and of cosmic rays in
particular. To achieve this the assistance of a more experience scientist was important,
of course.

When the telescope was built, a series of measurements was performed. The idea
of what to measure comes naturally. The test of stability is obvious. The experimental
setup produced a number of ﬁles with huge (on the respective scale) amounts of data.
The interface and registration program was created in such a way that each single
registration was written on to the disk. The help of the scientist was then necessary
to draw the attention of students to the smooth changes of the counting rate seen in
Fig. 2. This was also a good occasion on which to study the foundations of statistics,
e.g., the variation of the Poisson distributed random variable. The explanation of these
changes as due to the barometric eﬀect also had to be introduced to the students by
T.W. Then, after a short lesson on statistics (straight line ﬁtting, χ2 methods, e.t.c.),
the students wrote their ﬁrst programs in C and ran them to get the result presented
above.

4.3. Further planned measurements

The telescope can be used also to make other measurements among which the most
obvious is to determine the zenith angle dependence of single cosmic ray muons. Studies
of the temperature eﬀect as well as searching for periodic muon ﬂux variations, 27
days, one day, semidiurnal to name only the shortest) are possible subjects of further
interesting studies. The attractive subject is to looking for a correlations of CR ﬂux
with other phenomena, to mention only the famous examples (?) in Janathan Swift’s
Gulliver’s Travels (almost 300 years ago), and William Herschel’s studies from very
beginning of the XIX century ( about 200 years ago), and more recently (2003) studies
on the inﬂuence of the cosmic ray intensity on the wheat price in medieval England [11].
The question if CR muons are correlated with average marks in school tests, can attract
large numbers of students.

5. Conclusions

We have shown that cosmic rays are one of the subjects of contemporary physics which
are very useful to raise the interest of science amongst students of high schools. The
present work proves that they are able to construct the apparatus which may be used
to give quite accurate data on cosmic rays at ground level. The value of the barometric
coeﬃcient can be obtained and other interesting studies can be performed. The analysis
of the data gives a perfect possibility for students to be introduced to statistical methods
at a level not available in standard courses.

The Geiger-M¨uller telescope hanging on a classroom wall and showing continuously
the number of mouns crossing it works well at increasing the horizons of mind not only
of young people but of all who see it.

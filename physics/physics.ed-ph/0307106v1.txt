The Lorentz Group, a Galilean

Approach.

July 26, 2013

We present a pedagogical approach to the Lorentz group. We start by introducing a compact

notation to express the elements of the fundamental representation of the rotations group.

Lorentz coordinate transformations are derived in a novel and compact form. We show

how to make a Lorentz transformation on the electromagnetic ﬁelds as well. A covariant

time-derivative is introduced in order to deal with non-inertial systems. Examples of the

usefulness of these results such as the rotating system and the Thomas precession, are also

presented.

Keywords: Special relativity, Lorentz transformations.

1 Introduction

Special relativity was ﬁrst introduced nearly a century ago in order to explain the massive

experimental evidence against ether as the medium for propagating electromagnetic waves.

As a consequence of special relativity an unexpected space-time structure was discovered.

The pure Lorentz transformations called boosts relate the changes of the space distances

and time intervals when they are measured from two diﬀerent inertial frames. Rotations

1

and boost transformations form the general Lorentz group (The properties of the Lorentz

group can be found in other references such as [1]-[4]).

We show how one can understand boost transformations, which follow from the postu-

lates of special relativity, as corresponding to deformations of the classical Galilean trans-

formations. Also we introduce a covariant temporal derivative to deal with non-inertial

systems. This article is arranged as follows. In section II we show a simple way to gen-

erate and write the matrices associated with the rotation of three dimensional vectors and

present some applications of our notation. In section III we ﬁnd the matrices of the boost

transformations starting from Galileo’s only by imposing the constance of the velocity of

light. Finally, in section IV we show how the electromagnetic ﬁelds transform under general

Lorentz transformations in the same fashion we introduced before. An appendix deal with

non-inertial system.

2.2 Rotations Algebra.

As is well known a group is a set of operators with a multiplication law which satisﬁes

four basic properties: closure, associativity, existence of the identity and the existence of

a unique inverse for each element. The set of rotation matrices R represents a group: the

rotation group. The elements of the rotation group are labeled by the set of continuos
generates the rotation matrix R(~θ), this is
parameters θi. The antisymmetric matrix ~θ

×
why it is called “generator”. Generators form a vector space as well. The rotations algebra

is the commutation relations among the elements of the generators vector space basis.

The closure property it is nothing more than the statement that the composition of two

rotations is again a rotation. This is implemented in group theory language by saying that

the commutator between two generators is a generator. For the generators of the rotation

group we obtain

2.3 Rotating Systems

All of the subsection [2.2] is standard, however in connection with subsection [2.1] we can

obtain interesting results. As an example of the usefulness of the notation introduced in (9)

for the rotation matrix, let’s ﬁnd the velocity and acceleration of a particle observed from a
rotating system. Let a vector ~x be the coordinates of a particle in an inertial system and ~x′

the coordinates of the same particle observed from a rotating system, with angular velocity

~ω; the origins of these two systems are located at the same geometrical point so that the

coordinates satisfy the relation

~x′ = e−~θ×~x,

(17)

where ~θ is a time-dependent function. In the inertial system the velocity and acceleration

of one particle are the ﬁrst and second time-derivative of the coordinates, respectively.

Assuming that the components of a force, acting over the particle, transform according to
(17) we conclude that, in the rotating system, the second Newton law ~F = m~a does not

have this form, unless we change the time-derivative to a covariant time-derivative given by

Thus we can deﬁne a covariant velocity ~v′ of the particle, seen in the rotating system, as
the covariant derivative of the coordinates; in the simple case in which ~ω is paralell to ~θ we

have

to (17).

In the same way the covariant acceleration is then given by

In the second term of the RHS we

recognize the Coriolis acceleration [4]-[7], and the centrifugal acceleration in the third term.

In this way the primed vectors are related with the un-primed quantities by a relation similar

3 Lorentz Transformations.

Lorentz transformations are the rules that relate space-time coordinates of any event in two

diﬀerent inertial systems. Basically, Lorentz transformations can be classiﬁed in two types,

rotations and boosts. A general Lorentz transformation is a mixing between them. Boosts

are the Lorentz transformations when the systems have parallel spatial axis with spatial

origin in relative movement. As we will see, Lorentz transformations are the generalization

of the classical rotations to 4-dimensional space-time.

3.1 Boost Transformations.

In order to deduced how to transform the coordinates of any event after a boost let us take
S′ to be an inertial system in relative movement with respect to another inertial system S.

The respective axes in both systems are parallel. Take also their spatial origin as coincident

at time zero for both systems. We get that the space-time origin of the two systems is the
same. According to the Galilean transformations, in that case, the coordinates t′ and ~x′ of
a event,as observed from S′, are related with the t and ~x coordinates of S given by

t′ = t

~x′ = ~x

~ut;

−

(21)

where ~u is the velocity of S′ relative to S. As a result of these relations the velocity of one
particle observed in S′ is the velocity observed by S minus the relative velocity ~u. Clearly

this is in contradiction with the postulate of special relativity that the speed of the light

is constant independently of the choice of coordinates, because that relation of velocities

remains true even when a light pulse is considered instead of a particle.

According to the special relativity principles if we suppose that a light pulse is emitted

from the origin the space-time coordinates, the pulse must satisfy

~c2t2

~x2 = c2t′2

~x′2 = 0.

One can, however, try to modify the Galilean transformations to make it compatible

with the relativity principles, let us proceed like this; for the u/c

Notice that (22) together with (23) satisfy the ﬁrst equation in (21) even if c2t2

~x2 vanishes.

−

That is, even if ~x and t represent the coordinates of any arbitrary event. These so deformed

Galilean transformations correspond to inﬁnitesimal boost transformations.

It is convenient to deﬁne a inﬁnitesimal parameter as

In general, a Lorentz vector is a 4-vector which transforms according to (27) (with

(28) and (30)). Just by introducing a deformation to the Galilean transformations one can

introduce the results of special relativity and motivate the necessity of a constant speed of

light (for any observer).

3.2 Lorentz Algebra.

As in section [2.2] once we know the way a vector transforms we can ﬁnd out about the

group algebra that these transformations imply. From the expression (27) one can guess

the generators of a boost transformation. The set of boost transformations does not form a

group, this can be seeing by the fact that the commutation relation between boost generators

is not a boost generator itself,

We see that the Lorentz algebra can be splitted into two “rotation” invariant subalgebras.

3.3 Thomas precession

Relation (33) correspond to the application of two consecutive boosts; it shows that a vector

is rotated when these two boosts are applied. This phenomena is known as the Thomas

precession. Physically the Thomas precession appears when we try to describe the time

evolution of quantities asociated to accelerated particles.

In order to analyze the problem of an accelerated particle, the usual thinking is of

a non-inertial system as composed of inﬁnite inertial system where the particle is always

instantaneously at rest in one of them [1], [8], [9]. However, as we will see, this problem

is equivalent (at least locally) to considering only one non-inertial rest frame where the

“boost” from the laboratory system is characterized by a time depending rapidity ~η(t).

For the non-accelerated particle the time derivative used in the laboratory system

changes as

when the observer uses the system where the particle is at rest.

Following the procedure of section [2.3], for an accelerated particle, we must deﬁne a

covariant time derivative for an observer in the frame in which the particle is at rest, as

with the the rotating system (18),

In the non-relativistic approximation, and considering (39) acting only on 3-vectors (see

appendix) we have

we ﬁnd that this system has a precession frecuency given by

transformations one is able to obtain, without too much eﬀort, a fundamental result of

relativistic mechanics.

notation.)

5 Conclusions

We have introduced a way of writing the coordinates of a rotated vector and deduced the

Coriolis acceleration in a straightforward way. The generators of the rotation group are

given a compact form.

In the same spirit we have obtained Lorentz transformations for

4-vectors and show how the Thomas precession appears in a non-inertial system after the

introduction the covariant time derivative.

Using a matrix construction we write the non-homogeneous Maxwell equations in a com-

pact form and, starting from this, we deduce the Lorentz transformations of the electromag-

netic ﬁelds using the notation introduced before. We show that the Lorentz transformation

of the electromagnetic ﬁelds can be seen as a rotations of the complexiﬁed electromagnetic
vector ~E + i ~B.

Eﬀectiveness of group interaction on conceptual standardized
test performance

Chandralekha Singh, University of Pittsburgh

We analyse the eﬀectiveness of working in pair on the Conceptual Survey of
Electricity and Magnetism test in a calculus-based introductory physics course. We
discuss the implications of pairing students with diﬀerent individual achievments.

Introduction

1
Peer collaboration has been exploited as a
learning tool in many diverse instructional
settings and with diﬀerent types and levels
of student populations. Here, we analyse
the eﬀectiveness of working in pairs on the
performance on a standardized conceptual
multiple-choice test, Conceptual Survey of
Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM), in a
calculus-based introductory physics course.
In two consecutive semesters,
in double
class periods (1 hour 50 minute stretch),
students were administered the test indi-
vidually and in groups of two after in-
struction of the relevant concepts. Each
time (whether group or individual) stu-
dents were allowed 50 minutes to take the
CSEM test. Between the individual and
group administrations of the test there was
a short 5-10 minute break and students
were required to turn in their ﬁrst response
so that they could not refer to it when
working in group. The test answers were
never discussed with students so when they
switched from individual to group (or vice
versa), they did not know if their initial
responses were correct or not.

Although some studies show that het-
erogenous groups are more eﬀective for
group learning, others show that working

this study, students were allowed to choose
their own partners. They were encouraged
to discuss the response with each other,
and each test counted for one quiz grade.
Students had an additional incentive to dis-
cuss the concepts because an examination
in two weeks covered the same material.
Moreover, both semesters, students had ex-
tensive experience working with two peers
in the recitation on context-rich problems

and with one peer during the lecture on
Mazur-style concept tests.

We note that the peer collaboration was
unguided in that there was no help or fa-
cilitation from the instructor. Therefore,
the trends that emerge may be applicable
to students working together outside of the
class but is likely to be diﬀerent from those
in collaborations between a tutor and tutee
where one person’s knowledge is on signif-
icantly ﬁrmer ground. One attractive fea-
ture of peer collaboration is that since both
peers have recently gone through similar
diﬃculties in assimilating and accomodat-
ing the new material, they can often re-
late to each other’s diﬃculties more easily
than the instructor. The instructors’ ex-
tensive experience can often make a con-
cept so obvious and automatic that they
may not comprehend why students are mis-
interpreting various aspect of a concept or
ﬁnding them problematic and confusing.
2 Discussion
The test was only administered after the in-
struction of the relevent concepts because
our goal
is to assess the eﬀectiveness of
group dynamics (not overall instruction).
To obtain two random equivalent samples,
all students in the class sitting on one side
of the isle took the individual test ﬁrst fol-
lowed by the group test (IG treatment: 74
students or 37 pairs) while those on the
other side of the isle took the group test
ﬁrst before taking it individually (GI treat-
ment: 54 students or 27 pairs). One reason
for giving the test in both orders was to as-
sess the eﬀect of thinking individually be-
fore the peer discussion. In the Mazur-style
peer instruction, students are ﬁrst asked to
think about the concepts based on the as-

1

sumption that not allowing an opportunity
to think individually may prevent students
from evaluating their own stand on a con-
cept. Another reason for designing both
the IG and GI treatments was to evaluate
the “test-retest” or “practice” eﬀect.

Although the trends on some individual
test items are interesting, here we only dis-
cuss the eﬀect of group work on the overall
test scores due to the space limitations. In
the GI treatment the average group score
was 71.7% compared to 70.3% average on
individual test that followed. Thus, on
the average, students performed the same
in the group and in the individual test-
ing that followed immediately (It should
be noted that students could not refer to
their group work when they worked indi-
vidually). In the IG treatment, the aver-
age group score was 72.5% compared to the
average individual score of 55% (normal-
ized gain 0.39). The fact that the group
performance on the IG and GI treatments
are virtually indistinguishable (72.5% vs.
71.7%) suggests that giving students an op-
portunity to think individually before the
peer discussion did not improve their group
performance. Also, in the IG treatment,
the normalized gain of 0.39 in the group
work is clearly not a “test-retest” eﬀect be-
cause considering the treatment samples to
be equivalent, we can compare the indi-
vidual performance on IG treament (55%)
with the group performance of GI treat-
ment (71.7%) which shows a gain of 0.37
(indistinguishable from 0.39). Therefore,
the rest of the discussion will mostly be fo-
cussed on the IG treatment.

But before moving on, we note some in-
teresting trends in the amount of time stu-
dents took in the IG and GI treatments
during the two testings in immediate suc-
cession.
In the GI treatment, during the
group work and in the IG treatment, both
during the individual and group work stu-
dents used the same amount of time. One
the other hand, students working individ-
ually after the group work in the GI treat-
ment on an average took only about one
third of the initial time spend on group
work. It appears that in the IG treatment,
despite having worked on the problems in-
dividually, students were willing to spend
the time discussing the same test because
they found the peer discussion useful. On

the other hand, in the GI treatment, af-
ter having discussed the test with peers,
students were reasonably sure about their
thoughts and did not consider it necessary
to brood over the problems again.
2.1 Evidence for co-construction
Although there is no concensus in the re-
search literature on the deﬁnition of “co-
construction”, we use this term to denote
cases where neither student alone chose the
correct response but the group discussion
helped converge on the correct response.
Co-construction can occur for several rea-
sons. For example, if the group memebers
chose diﬀerent incorrect responses, they
will have to explain their reasoning to each
other. This can unravel problems in their
initial logic and complementary informa-
tion provided by peers can help them con-
verge on the correct solution. Even in cases
where both students have the same incor-
rect response, co-construction can occur if
students are unsure about their initial re-
sponse and are willing to discuss their ap-
prehensions with peers.
Important clues
provided by peers during the discussion can
trigger recall of revelant concepts and can
help the group co-construct.

Table 1 displays the fraction of pair of
correct-incorrect response patterns based
individual response and
upon students’
how they changed in the group work (for
IG treatment).
It shows evidence for co-
construction in 7.5% of overall cases.

Table 1: 0 refers to an incorrect response
and 1 refers to a correct response. The
fractions associated with 00 (both incor-
rect), 01 (one incorrect), and 11 (both cor-
rect) is based upon the individual response
across all items while the percentage for
000, for example, refers to the group re-
sponse in which both individuals and the
group had incorrect response.

To verify that the 001 cases in which
both students individually chose incorrect
response but the group chose the correct
response is not due to “just guessing”, we

analyse the ﬁrst row of table 1 in detail.
Table 2 subdivides this row based upon
whether both partners had the same or dif-
ferent incorrect responses and if the group
response was one of the original incorrect
response or a third incorrect response.

Table 2 shows that for 00 (same incor-
in 22%, and for 00′′ (diﬀerent in-
rect),
in 34% of the cases, group re-
correct),
sponse was correct.
In comparsion, the
relatively small frequency of the incorrect
group responses (see table 2) that were
not originally selected by either individu-
als suggests that students were not “just
guessing”. Although we did not conduct
formal interviews with students after they
worked in groups, we brieﬂy discussed the
aspects of the group work that were helpful
with several students. Most students ad-
mitted that they got useful insights about
various electricity and magnetism concepts
by discussing them with peers. Students
frequently noted that they sometimes had
diﬃculty interpreting the problems alone
but it became easier with a friend. They
also said that talking to peers forced them
to organize their thoughts, ﬁnd fault with
their initial reasoning, and reminded them
of concepts they had diﬃculty recalling on
their own. Also, qualitative observation
shows that students were more likely to
draw ﬁeld lines, write equations or scrib-
ble on their exams in the group work than
in the individual work.
2.2 Negative impact of grouping?
Table 1 shows that out of all the 01 cases in
which one student individually had the cor-
rect response and the other had an incor-
rect response, 78% of the group responses
were correct. The fact that 22% of 01 re-
sulted in incorrect group response (010) is
only slightly alarming because it was an
unguided peer discussion. It can happen if

students who individually chose the correct
response are not very conﬁdent and cannot
defend or justify their response. However,
the fact that a majority of 01 resulted in
011 suggests that students who individu-
ally chose the correct response were gener-
ally more conﬁdent and were able to justify
their choice. It may also suggest that stu-
dents who got the item wrong individually
were unsure of their choice and were willing
to listen to their peers. As we will see in
the next section, group work never resulted
in a negative individual gain.
2.3 Individual gain and retention
One can hypothesize that the individual
performance in the GI treatment was much
superior (70.3%) compared to the IG treat-
ment (55%) because students could imme-
diately recall the group responses for all
the 32 test items in the GI treatment and
their superior performance does not reﬂect
the eﬀectiveness of group work with regard
to the retention of the concepts discussed.
Similarly, in the IG treatment, the superior
group performance compared to the indi-
vidual performance is due to a large num-
ber of 011 but it does not mean that the
student who got 0 individually will retain
what they learned in the group work. To
test this hypothesis, two weeks after the IG
and GI treatments, all students individu-
ally took the CSEM test again. In view of
the fact that students earlier went through
either the IG or GI treatments, we now re-
label the treatments IGI and GII. We note
that students did not know that they will
be taking the same test again. Although
it would have been signiﬁcantly better if
another equally reliable test for assessing
similar concepts could be used; its unavail-
ability lead us to use the same test. How-
ever, the test was never discussed with stu-
dents at any time. We are currently con-
ducting a study in which students individ-
ually took the test once and then again two
weeks later without any group intervention
to tease apart the eﬀectiveness of group
work vs. the eﬀect of having seen the test
and having the opportunity to study before
the second individual testing.

In the IGI treatment, the average for the
second individual testing was 74% which is
a gain of 0.42% compared to the initial in-
dividual score of 55%. A detailed compari-
son of the scores for the group vs. the sec-

ond individual adminstration shows that
81% of the overall individual responses cho-
sen by the members of a particular group
were the same as the group responses. Out
of the 19% (second) individual responses
that were diﬀerent from the group, roughly
11% went from incorrect to correct while
8% went from correct to incorrect. The cor-
responding numbers in the GII treatment
are virtually the same. This suggests that
the gist of group interaction was mostly re-
tained even after two weeks.
2.4 Eﬀective pairing
To learn about the type of pairings that will
optimize the overall gain for this concep-
tual test, we divided the 75 students in the
IGI treatment into three groups: I (high),
II (middle), and III (low), based upon their
initial individual score on CSEM. In tables
3a and 3b below, we show the average ini-
tial individual score (left) and the normal-
ized gain in the second individual testing
(right) for the 9 types of pairs: (I I), (I II),
(I III), (II I), (II II), (II III), (III I), (III II),
and (III III). The top row of the table refers
to the performance of type I students for
diﬀerent kinds of pairings: (I I), (I II), and
(I III). Similarly, the middle and bottom
row refer to the performance of type II and
type III students respectively. For compar-
ison, for all 75 students together, the aver-
age initial individual score was 55% and the
average gain was 0.42.

The above table shows that although all
students in the IGI treatment gained in the
second individual testing two weeks later
compared to the ﬁrst, the gain matrix is
not symmetric. For example, the gain of I
due to the interaction with III (0.29) is not
the same as that of III due to I (0.41) in the
(I III) pairing. It is striking that the gain of
type I and type II students is signiﬁcantly
lower when they paired with type III stu-
dents. Type I students have similar gains
whether they paired with type I or type
II students while Type II students beneﬁt
more from pairing with type I than with
another type II student. Interestingly, the
gain of type III students (lowest third) is

virtually the same regardless of who they
paired with (bottom row). One hypothesis
is that while pairing with a higher achieve-
ment student provided type III with an op-
portunity to do well in the group test, they
did not retain all of the concepts because
they were subdued by the higher achiev-
ing student and did not participate very
actively in the discussions. Thus, the op-
portunity to learn from the higher achiev-
ing student may have been outweighed by
the inability of type III to process the infor-
mation at the rate discussed by the other
student and their inability to participate
fully in the discussions which is crucial
for retention. On the other hand, in the
(III III) pairing, both students had compa-
rable but some complementary knowledge
and both actively participated in the dis-
cussions. The evidence for this hypothe-
sis comes from the comparison of the av-
erage group (left) and second individual
test score (right) for each of the pairings
as shown in tables 4a and 4b below:

A comparison of tables 4a and 4b shows
that the average individual score of type
III students in the (I III) pairing after
two weeks deteriorated (61%) compared to
their group score (72%). Also, a compar-
ison of tables 3a and 4a shows that type
I students did not beneﬁt from interac-
tions with type III students and the av-
erage initial score for type I students and
the group score for the (I III) pairing are
the same. Similar comparisons for type II
students shows that although they beneﬁt-

least for this conceptual test, the pairing
that helps maximize the overall gain is one
that only has (I II) and (III III) types
of pairs.
It will be useful to investigate
the extent to which this result is universal,
i.e., two peers collaborating on conceptual
tests show highest overall gains when the
high and middle achievement students are
paired and the low achievement students
are paired with each other.

Centre, Faure, South Africa, 31 January to 3 February 2000

Introduction

If in 1975 one had asked for a brief history of hadronic physics it would have undoubtedly

gone something like this [1] : ﬁrst there was a ‘classical age’ initiated by Yuhawa’s (1935)
meson hypothesis for the nuclear force and terminated (± 1950) by invading hoards of
“strange” particles and resonance. There followed a sort of ‘dark ages’ where arcane rites

of dispersion relations, Regge poles and dual resonance models were practiced. Finally

we are now in the ‘enlightened age’ of “quantum chromodynamics” (QCD): baryons –

like the proton and neutron – are composites of three “quarks” while mesons are made

of quark-antiquark pairs; these are inseparably bound by a colour force which becomes

weak at short distances, and the interaction between hadrons is a colour analogue of the

van der Waal’s force between neutral atoms.

Alas, some twenty ﬁve years later we still are unable to calculate many interesting quan-

tities such as the nuclear mass or nucleon-nucleon potential directly from QCD (albeit
lattice gauge enthusiasts will tell you with the next generation of computers · · ·). One
is left with a variety of models (bag, Skyrme, etc.) and a sort of interpolating scheme

(QCD sum rules), but nothing approaching the systematics and accuracy of quantum

electrodynamics (QED). The diﬀerence is due to conﬁnement: whereas in QED the basic

entities (electrons and photons) are observable, in QCD they (quarks and gluons) are not,

rather we can only observe their hadronic composites.

Still, the triumphs of QED were aﬀorded by the realization that one did not need to be

able to calculate the electron mass to determine the eﬀects of the self energy of a bound

electron – the Lamb shift [2]. That one could apply a modiﬁed version of this and work

directly with hadrons in a systematic way was ﬁrst suggested by Weinberg (1979) [3] and

marked the birth of a new age: the age of eﬀective ﬁeld theory whose ramiﬁcations go far

beyond hadronic physics alone.

There are by now a number of textbook exposition [4] and review articles for the sophis-

ticate; in this talk I will endeavour to give the novice some feeling for what is going on

using the old static model [5] as an example. Then, at the end I will return to the wider

implications.

A word of warning: for simplicity (mine, not yours) I will use ‘natural units’ ¯h = c = 1 ;

mass and momenta are in units of energy, and length in units of inverse energy, a useful

¯hc = 1 = 197MeV · fm ,

conversion being

(1 fm = 10−13 cm) .

The Static Model

Let me begin by recalling that the impetus for pre-QCD meson theory was Yukawa’s ob-

servation that in contrast to Poisson’s equation for the electrostatic potential, the equation

  ∂2
∂t2 − ∆ + m2! φ = gn

has for a static charge at the origin, n(~r) = δ(~r)

φ(r) =

g
4π

e−mr

r

(2)

(3)

whose range is not inﬁnite but 1/m. Now suppose for the moment n = 0 ; by making the

the Fourier expansion

one obtains for each ~k

φ(t, ~r) = Z

d3k
(2π3)

ϕ (t, ~k) ei~k·~r

¨ϕ (~k) + ω2 (~k) ϕ (~k) = 0 , ω2(~k) = ~k2 + m2 .

(4)

(5)

Thus, classically one has a set of harmonic oscillators and the dispersion relation ω(~k) is

that for a particle of mass m in relativity. Each oscillator has a “momentum”

π(~k) = ˙ϕ(~k)

(6)

and the total energy is

H0 = Z

d3k

(2π)3 

π2(~k) +

ω2(~k)

ϕ2 (~k)
 .

(7)

Now each oscillator can be quantized individually, but instead of ϕ and π its more con-

venient to use a and a+

This gives

φ =

(a+ − a) .

ˆH0 = Z

d3k
(2π)3 ω(k) ˆa+(~k) ˆa(~k)

(8)

(9)

where we have thrown out an inﬁnite sum at “zero point energies”2 which play no role

here. The ‘ladder operators’ have non-vanishing commutator

hˆa(~k) , ˆa+(~k′)i = (2π)3δ (~k − ~k ′)

and the lowest energy, ground or ‘vacuum’ state |0i obeys

ˆa(k)|0i = 0

so indeed it has zero energy. The state |~ki = ˆa+(~k)|0i has the property

ˆH0 |~ki = ω(~k) |~ki

so describing a particle (meson) with (3-) momentum ~k and energy ω(~k) .

(10)

(11)

(12)

When the right hand side of (2) is nonzero, i.e. the nucleon is present, the oscillators are

driven so the total energy (hamiltonian) is

ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆHI

.

(13)

Now, H0 is unmodiﬁed if the nucleon is static (in practical terms this means we are

neglecting recoil which is a fair approximation to reality).

In writing the ‘interaction

part’ HI we need to account for the fact that the light mesons (pions) are ‘pseudoscalar’3,
i.e. under ‘parity’, ~r → −~r , φ → −φ whereas for a scalar φ is unchanged. Taking this
together with the fact that the nucleon is spin 1/2 (occurring in two spin states, “up”

and “down”), because the energy should not be changed by parity or rotations the unique

choice is

where K

and for simplicity “isospin” is neglected. Note the coupling parameter g must have di-

mension of length to compensate that of K

.

Finally it is also worth mentioning that if one replaces the words nucleon and meson by

electron and phonon this model bears many similarities to problems in solid state physics

[6].

The Self-Energy

Alack, unlike ˆH0, ˆH cannot be diagonalized exactly but can be treated by time indepen-

dent perturbation theory familiar to every quantum mechanic. Taking the unperturbed

state as that with no mesons and one nucleon the leading energy shift – which is to say

the nucleon mass shift because it is static – is given by4

which can be given a diagrammatic representation

3In QCD this follows from ‘spontaneously broken chiral symmetry’.

Figure 1:

Reading from right to left : the nucleon emits a meson losing energy ω(~k), remains with
energy −ω for a time and then reabsorbs the meson; it can do this for any ~k so we add
all the intermediate states. Turning this around it is easy to use these ‘Feynman rules’ to

write down contributions corresponding to

Of course the energy shift is not a matrix but (K

(17)

where k = |~k|. It is painfully obvious that only the last integral converges to πm3/2, the
rest diverge! This is analogous to (even classical) electrodynamics where in the self-energy

of a point change is inﬁnite. To be honest we ought to insert a convergence or ‘form’ factor

all the way back in HI, but then the result depends on how we choose to ‘cutoﬀ’.

6

Irrespective of details we can say that the nucleon mass M is of the form

M = ˆM + κ1 m2 −

g2
8π

m3 + ....

(18)

where ˆM , which is what M would be were the meson massless, and κ1 ‘renormalised’

parameters hiding the strong cutoﬀ dependence. The ellipsis represents weakly cutoﬀ

dependent parts, higher loops, etc. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant thing about (18) is that as a

function of m2, the parameter appearing in H, the unknown parameters appear in the

analytic part whereas the non-analytic part is calculable. It is not hard to see why:

if

we tried to expand (17) in powers of m2 we soon encounter integrals which diverge at

the lower limit only, and these do not care how we ‘regularize’. One reason why this is

signiﬁcant is that in QCD the pseudoscalar mass squared is proportional to the quark
mass, m2 ∝ mq ; the ﬁrst two terms in M give the Gell-Mann-Okubo relation for the
barren octet and the equal splitting rule for the decuplet, the last the correlation to these.

But there is something deeper: the theory we are working with is ‘non-renormalizable’,

signalled by needing κ1 as a parameter in the 1-loop calculation. At 2-loops we need more,

and ultimately to hide all our ignorance would require an inﬁnite number of parameters!

Once more, with feeling this time, the bits which are cutoﬀ sensitive are analytic in m2

so

M = ˆM + κ1 m2 + κ2 m4 + · · · + calculable .

Now if we replace the upper limit in (17) by Λ with

our one-loop calculation says K [1]

1 = Λ−1. Generally then

Λ = 2π/g

m = ˆm + ¯κ1 m2/Λ + ¯κ2 m4/Λ3 + · · · + calculable

with ¯κi a pure number of order unity.

(19)

(20)

We have arrived at the crux of why ﬁeld theory is eﬀective in the usual sense of the word.

The inﬁnity of parameters do not contribute equally, and higher orders are suppressed by

powers of m/Λ.5 Were we calculating meson-nucleon scattering the corresponding series
would be in |~q|/Λ and m/Λ, ~q the meson momentum, so this only works for energies low
compared to Λ. For the case in hand, m/Λ ≈ mπ/mρ ≈ 140 MeV/770 MeV and (18) is
valid up to the 20% level (the same as recoil corrections).

More Eﬀective Theory

In conclusion, let me stress that our modest calculation did not require that we know

anything about the underlying theory, QCD. All we needed were the low energy degrees

of freedom and their interaction. Now, quantum gravity is discarded as a fundamental

theory because it is nonrenormalizable, involving as it does the dimensionful newtonian

coupling

G = ℓ2
pℓ

(22)

where ℓpℓ ≈ 10−33 cm is the Planck length. As noted by Donoghue [7], however, whatever
the ultimate ‘Theory of Everything’ (GOD) quantum gravity can be treated as an eﬀective

ﬁeld theory and e.g. quantum corrections to the newtonian potential

V (r) = −

Gm1m2

r


r !2
1 + β  ℓpℓ

+ · · ·


(23)

are calculable. β is a computable number of order unity, and the pathetic smallness of

the correction is less signiﬁcant than the realization that it can be done.

5Similarly, heavy particle contributions are suppressed by powers of 1/mH. They are subsumed in ˆM

and ¯κi .

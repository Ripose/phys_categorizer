The Precessing Top

1. Introduction

When a symmetric top is set spinning with angular velocity ωc about its own axis, it traces out a

circle about a vertical direction with angular velocity ωz, as shown in Fig. 1.

In most textbooks [1, 2, 3] the precessional angular velocity ωz is calculated under the assumption

that it is much smaller than the spin angular velocity ωc. This makes for a simpliﬁcation of the

calculation by considering the total angular momentum as due to the spin motion only, and thus

directed along the symmetry axis.

In this case, the angular momentum along the symmetry axis is L = Iωc, where I is the moment

of inertia about this same axis. The tip of this vector describes a circle of radius L sin θ around

the vertical direction. The torque of gravity is mgl sin θ, where m is the mass of the top and l is

the distance of its center of mass C to O. In a time interval ∆t the torque changes the angular

momentum by Lsin θωz∆t in a direction tangent to the circle. Equating torque to time change in

angular momentum yields the usual formula ωz = mgl/Iωc for slow precession [2].

In this note I drop the simplifying assumption that the total angular momentum is solely along the

symmetry axis in order to obtain the following general expression for ωz,

ωz =

Iωc ±qI 2ω2

c + 4(I − In)mgl cos θ

2(In − I) cos θ

,

(0.1)

where In is the moment of inertia of the top about any axis normal to the symmetry axis at O.
There are two values for ωz if I 2ω2
c + 4(I − In)mgl cos θ > 0. This condition is always satisﬁed
when I > In. When I < In it determines the minimum velocity ωc = (2/I)q(In − I)mgl cos θ

for a steady precession to occur.

Formula (0.1) is most useful for practical purposes when ωc is very large, in which case the appro-

ximation √1 + x = 1 + x/2 for the square root in (0.1) when x = 4(I − In)mgl cos θ/I 2ω2

(0.2)

This approximation for ωz yields not only the previous formula for slow precession ω(−)
but also the formula for fast precession ω(+)

z = mgl/Iωc,

z = Iωc/(In − I) cos θ.

In this last case, the sense of precession depends on whether I < In or I > In. For the top shown

in Fig. 1, and for most ordinarily shaped child’s top, In > I.

Which precession occurs depends on how the top is set in motion. Once it is started at an angle

θ to the vertical with angular velocity ωc and either of the above values for ωz, it will continue to

precess steadily.

2. Analysis

The analysis that leads to (0.1) is elementary and amounts to taking into account the angular

momentum about the vertical direction. The angular velocity ωz has components ωz cos θ along

the symmetry axis, and ωz sin θ along an axis normal to it, as shown in Fig. 2. Thus the angular

momentum about the vertical direction can be decomposed into a component Iωz cos θ along the

symmetry axis, and a component Inωz sin θ normal to the symmetry axis. Since these two com-

ponents also describe a circle around the vertical direction, the previous simpliﬁed analysis can

be applied separately here for the components along and normal the symmetry axis. Thus the

correction for the change in total angular momentum in a time interval ∆t has now two steps.

a. The change in the component of the angular momentum along the symmetry axis is what

we had before, with the addition of the extra term Iωz cos θ due to the precession motion. It

becomes (L + Iωzcos θ) sin θωz∆t.

b. The component of the angular momentum normal to the symmetry axis is Ln = Inωz sin θ.

The tip of this vector describes a circle of radius Ln cos θ around the vertical direction. The

torque of gravity changes this component in a direction tangent to this circle. Thus the

change in the normal component is given by Ln cos θωz∆t.

Since the changes in (a) and (b) are opposite in direction, equating torque to time change in angular
momentum now leads to the equation (I − In)ω2
z cos θ + (Iωc)ωz − mgl = 0 for ωz, whose solutions
are given by (0.1).

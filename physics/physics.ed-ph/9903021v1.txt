In a recent article1 H. L. Neal presents a pedagogical ap-
proach to density-functional theory2 in the formulation
of Kohn and Sham,3 which is still largely ignored in un-
dergraduate teaching despite its enormous signiﬁcance in
many branches of physics, by discussing the application
to one-dimensional two-particle systems. In this context
Neal derives an analytic expression for the Hohenberg-
Kohn functional F [ρ], given by Eq. (30) of the original
paper, that he suggests is exact for all systems with the
harmonic interaction u(x1, x2) = k(x1−x2)2/2. The pur-
pose of this comment is to refute this claim for arbitrary
external potentials and to point out that the functional
used in Ref. 1 really constitutes an approximation in the
same spirit as the local-density approximation.

Exploiting the universality of the Hohenberg-Kohn

functional, Neal calculates

F = E −

v(x)ρ(x) dx

(1)

Z

for an analytically solvable model of two coupled har-
monic oscillators. He then rewrites the total energy E
and the external potential v on the right-hand side in
terms of the density ρ, using exact relations that are only
valid at the ground state of the particular model, how-
ever. This substitution hence replaces the explicit de-
pendence on the external potential by a system-speciﬁc
energy surface and fails to produce a universal functional.
In particular, the minimum of the total energy obtained
in this way in general diﬀers from the true ground state.
This subtle point is best seen if the resulting functional
F [ρ] is directly inserted into the variational expression

(v(x) − µ) ρ(x) dx

that determines the ground-state density for arbitrary
external potentials.2 The Lagrange multiplier µ enforces
the proper normalization. In the notation of Ref. 1, which
also provides δF [ρ]/δρ(x) [Eq. (31)], one thus obtains

ρ(x) = ρ0 exp

−

4ω(v(x) − v(0))

(cid:18)

¯hω0(ω0 + ω) (cid:19)

and hence recovers the speciﬁc relation between v and ρ
that was previously employed to construct the functional
F [ρ] in the ﬁrst place. By design, this expression is ex-
act for the coupled harmonic oscillators. For all other
external potentials, however, Eq. (3) constitutes an ap-
proximation to the ground-state density that does not
coincide with the minimum of the true total-energy sur-
face.

The Kohn-Sham formalism requires F [ρ] as an auxil-

iary quantity to deﬁne

Fr[ρ] = F [ρ] − Tr[ρ],

(4)

where Tr[ρ] denotes the kinetic energy of the noninteract-
ing reference system. In the usual terminology, Fr[ρ] con-
tains the Hartree and the exchange-correlation part of the
total energy, its derivative δFr[ρ]/δρ(x) contributes to
the eﬀective potential that appears in the single-particle
Kohn-Sham equations. It follows from the above argu-
ment that this term is not treated exactly in Ref. 1, be-
cause the Hohenberg-Kohn functional as well as Tr[ρ] are
constructed for a particular system and hence are not free
from an implicit dependence on the harmonic-oscillator
potential. The Hartree and exchange-correlation poten-
tial is thus modelled by that of two coupled harmonic
oscillators.
In this sense the approach is analogous in
spirit to the local-density approximation3 widely used in
atomic and solid-state physics, which similarly replaces
the exact exchange-correlation energy by that of a homo-
geneous electron gas with the same local density.

Much as the local-density approximation is successful
for weakly inhomogeneous systems, so Neal’s eﬀective po-
tential may be applied to one-dimensional two-particle
systems with the harmonic interaction in general conﬁn-
ing potentials. Indeed, Ref. 1 presents meaningful results
for several potential wells with diﬀerent shapes. For a
quantitative analysis we carefully reexamine the exam-
ples discussed in the original paper. We diagonalize the
Hamiltonians using a basis of noninteracting harmonic-
oscillator eigenfunctions. In this way all matrix elements
can be calculated either analytically or by a numerically
exact Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The results for case 2:
v(x) = α|x| and case 3: v(x) = α exp(βx2), converged
with respect to the number of basis functions, are more
accurate and hence diﬀer from those quoted in Ref. 1.
We have set α = 1.0, β = 0.1 and k = 1.0. In Table I we
contrast the exact total energy E with the Kohn-Sham
solution EKS. Although small, the deviation is genuine.
For comparison we also quote the estimate Evar from a
two-parameter variational wave function given in Ref. 1.
The two approximate schemes yield similar small errors

if the quantum well resembles a harmonic potential near
the origin (case 3), otherwise the variational wave func-
tion is less appropriate and the eﬀective potential gives
better agreement with the exact solution (case 2).

In summary, although not exact, Neal’s scheme yields
good approximate results for conﬁned two-particle sys-
tems with the harmonic interaction in one dimension.
Furthermore, the procedure closely follows the spirit of
the widely used local-density approximation and is hence
of additional pedagogical value. We hope that it will
ﬁnd recognition and contribute towards making density-
functional theory more accessible to students.

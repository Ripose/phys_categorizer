A common practice in many statistical thermodynamics textbooks when

calculating the partition function, is to replace the relevant statistical sums

by integrals over a quasicontinuum of levels, right at the outset.1 Since the

interlevel separation is inversely proportional to the system’s size, when doing

that, they are really assuming an inﬁnite system, and washing away any ﬁnite

size eﬀects. This, of course, simpliﬁes the problem at hand, but at the same

time obscures the manner in which size eﬀects enter when dealing with ﬁnite

systems. In this Note, we illustrate the role of ﬁnite size eﬀects by evaluating

the main corrections to the canonical partition function of the ideal gas due

to a large, yet ﬁnite, container volume.

Suﬃcient conditions under which it is valid to replace sums by integrals

have been examined by Stutz2 using the Euler summation formula. For the

case of the one-particle, one-dimensional partition function, Fox3 rederived

Stutz results by using the Jacobi transformation. In the spirit of Fox, we

will express the partition function of a three-dimensional ideal gas enclosed

in a impenetrable box in terms of complete elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst kind,

whose argument obeys a transcendental equation, and will explicitly derive

the main ﬁnite volume corrections to thermodynamical quantities. A dif-

ferent approach will be followed for the case of an impenetrable spherical

container, where we will expand the density of states in powers of the en-

ergy. Surface terms appear in the expansion coeﬃcients, leading to ﬁnite size

eﬀects in the thermodynamics of the system.

2

We will ﬁnd that, for both, the box and the spherical container, the

ﬁnite volume correction terms to thermodynamical quantities, have the same

functional dependence on the ratio (thermal wavelength

area/volume).

Ideal gas in a box: Consider an ideal monoatomic gas of N identical

particles of mass m, enclosed in a box with sides a1, a2 and a3, at temperature

T . We will assume a gas temperature (density) high (low) enough so that the

Boltzmann statistics is applicable. In those conditions, the partition function

is given by4

where λ(T ) = h/√3mkBT is the de Broglie thermal wavelength and kB, h

are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively. At room temperature,

the spacing between two consecutive arguments in the exponential is very

small (of the order of 10−10 for m = 10−22 g, ai = 10 cm and T = 300 K).

However, since σi depends on the inverse of the product temperature

×
(linear size of the system)2, according to Eq.(3), there are situations, such

as small volumes (“molecular cavities”) where such spacing, while still small,

can grow considerably (of the order of 10−3 for T = 1 K and ai = 10−5 cm).

As soon as (σ/π) deviates slightly from unity, the intersection of the two

curves tends to occur very close to either k = 0 or k = 1, which justiﬁes a

perturbation expansion around those points.

At high temperatures (or large container dimensions) (σ/π) << 1 and

the root of eq.(7) lies close to k = 1, which implies, according to eq.(7),

(π/σ)K(0) = π2/2σ. After inserting this into eq.(6), we obtain

Ideal gas in spherical container: Let us now consider the same ideal

gas of the preceding section enclosed in a spherical container of radius R.

The eigenvalue equation is : 9 jl(kR) = 0 with l = 0, 1, 2, ... where k =

(8π2mE/h2)1/2 and jl(x) is a spherical Bessel function. For each l, we have

an inﬁnite number of solutions, indexed by an integer n = 1, 2, ... and for each

(l, n) we have an angular momentum degeneracy of (2l + 1). The energies

are Eln = (h2/8π2mR2)X 2

ln, where Xln is the nth root of jl(x). In the limit

of large R, we can approximate the Xln using McMahon’s expansion: 10

Now, instead of using Eq.(15) to calculate directly the atomic partition

function, we will use it to evaluate the density of states, which is all we need

to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system. For a container

of “simple” shape it is natural to expect that the main contributions to the

density of states will have the form:

ρ(E)

ρ1E1/2 + ρ2 + ρ3E−1/2

≈

(16)

6

where each term has the typical form of a three, two, and one dimensional

density of states. The relative importance of each term in Eq.(16) will de-

pend upon the “dimensionality” of the container. Thus, for our spherical

container where “volume” predominates over “area” and “length”, the main

contribution comes from the term proportional to E1/2, with a small (con-

stant) correction term. In this case, it is convenient to rewrite Eq.(16) in

terms of dimensionless parameters R1, R2:

E1/2 + R2

(17)

where we have kept only the surface correction term. We proceed as fol-

lows: Starting from Eq.(15), we evaluate numerically the integrated density

of states φ(E), deﬁned as the number of states with energies less than E.

Then, we perform a least-squares ﬁt of the resulting histogram to the smooth

function

obtaining the optimal values for R1, R2. The approximate density of states

is then given by Eq.(17).

The atomic partition function is given by

By using Eqs.(17),(19) and the numerical values obtained for R1, R2, we

can write the main corrections to several thermodynamics quantities:

The method outlined above for the sphere can be used for any other

container of “simple” shape, provided the eigenergies are known either ana-

lytically or numerically. To its conceptual simplicity we have to oppose its

rather slow numerical convergence, requiring very many energies to obtain

coeﬃcients with a given accuracy.

As in the case of the box, the main ﬁnite volume corrections for the

sphere have the form constant

(thermal wavelength

area/volume). For

both, the box and the spherical container, the thermodynamical quantities

U0, P0, C0 and S0 do not depend on the shape of the container. The main

ﬁnite size corrections have the same functional dependence on the ratio (ther-

mal wavelength

area/volume) for both shapes.

Abstract

We introduce and solve in closed form a simple model of a macroscopic

body propagating in a one-dimensional resistive medium at temperature T .

The assumption of completely inelastic collisions between the body and the

particles composing the medium leads to a resistive force that is opposite

and proportional to the square of the body’s velocity.

Key words: air drag, collisions

The topic of macroscopic bodies moving through resistive media, such as

air or viscous ﬂuids, gives rise to one aspect that students of Introductory

Physics courses ﬁnd rather mysterious: The origin of the ‘force law’ that

describes the eﬀective force on the moving body as it propagates through

the resistive medium. The student is usually told that the eﬀective force on

the body is either proportional to the speed of the body or to the square of

the body’s speed, according to whether the body has, or does not have, a

small cross–sectional area, or whether it is moving at low or high speeds1.

Under further questioning, the instructor might tell the student that these

‘laws’ are based on ‘experimental observations’ which are diﬃcult to obtain

analytically. There are basic models, however, that show in a simple manner

how the energy and momentum exchange between the moving body and the

particles composing the resistive medium lead to some of these ‘force laws’.

In this article, we present an extremely simpliﬁed model that leads to a very

well–known ‘force law’: a resistive force that is opposite and proportional to

the square of the body’s velocity: F = −γ V 2.

Consider a body, represented by a heavy point ‘particle’ of mass M0 and

initial speed V0, that propagates inside a one–dimensional medium composed

of identical point particles of mass m, with m ≪ M0 which are in thermal

equilibrium at temperature T (Fig.1). We will consider here the ‘short’ time

scale where the body does not have enough time to reach thermal equilibrium

with the surrounding medium. The ‘brownian motion’ case where the body

is in thermal equilibrium with the medium have been nicely discussed by de

Grooth3. Let us denote by vj, the velocity of the jth medium particle. Since

2

the medium is one-dimensional the particles can be labelled unambiguously.

For instance, the particles to the right of the body could be labelled by odd

values of j, while the ones to the left, by even j values. Because of thermal

equilibrium the {vj} are random quantities whose values are taken from a

gaussian distribution of width proportional to the medium temperature T .

We will assume for simplicity that the body undergoes completely inelastic

collisions with the medium particles.

After the ﬁrst collision we have, because of momentum conservation,

M0V0 + mv1 = (M0 + m)V1

i.e., the speed of the body after its ﬁrst collision is

V1 =

M0
M0 + m (cid:19)

(cid:18)

V0 +

m
M0 + m (cid:19)

(cid:18)

v1,

where v1 denotes the velocity of the medium particle with which the body

collides ﬁrst (this particle could come from the left or right of M). Some time

afterwards, the body (now with mass M0 + m) will suﬀer a second inelastic

collision from which will emerge with velocity:

V2 =

M0
M0 + 2m (cid:19)

(cid:18)

V0 +

m
M0 + 2m (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(v1 + v2).

where v2 is velocity of the medium particle who suﬀers the second collision

with M0, and so on. After n of these collisions, the speed of the body will be

where we remind the reader that the {vj} are random with hvji = 0, hv2

We note that, as the number of collisions tends to inﬁnity (i.e., after a ‘long’

time), hV 2

n i → (kT /M0V0)hVni = (kT /M(n)), where M(n) = M0 + nm is the

eﬀective body mass after n collisions. This is nothing else but equipartition:

M(n)hV 2

n i → kT = mhv2i, where v is the velocity of a medium particle.

If we now assume that ρ, the density of medium particles per unit length

is constant, then we can express n as n = ρ x where x is the distance travelled

by the body between its ﬁrst and n-th collision. We are assuming here, as

in hydrodynamics, that an element of length ∆x while ‘small’ will contain

a great number of medium particles. By re-expressing n in terms of x in

(1), we can express the average velocity of the body after it has travelled a

distance x as

hV (x)i =

M0
M0 + ρ m x !

 

V0,

and the average of the velocity squared as

hV (x)2 i =

hV (x)i.

The average velocity decreases monotonically with distance. Its explicit time

dependence can be found from (3): dx/dt = M0V0/(M0 + ρmx), which can

be integrated to give

1 + 2(t/t0)

where X0 ≡ M0/(ρm) and t0 ≡ X0/V0 constitute natural length and time

scales. Finally, after replacing (5) into (3), or by direct diﬀerentiation of (5),

one obtains

and V (t), all of which diverge at long times.

Average resistive force. As the body propagates, it is being hit from front and

back by medium particles which stick completely to it after colliding. This

accretion process is rather akin to the opposite process that occurs in the

propulsion of a rocket engine: instead of expelling matter our body absorbs

it. One process is the time-reversal of the other. The average eﬀective force

on the body can be directly computed from hF i = M(t)dhV (t)i/dt. From

Eqs.(6) and (7) one obtains:

hF i = −

M0V0
t0

1
1 + 2(t/t0)

hF i = −γ V (t)2

which can be recast as

with γ ≡ ρm.

Another way to compute hF i is to start from conservation of momentum

during an inﬁnitesimal collision, M(x)V (x)+dM(x)v = (M(x)+dM(x))(V (x)+

dV (x)). This implies that the instantaneous force on the body is

Since M(x) = M0 + ρmx, we now have hF i = −γ hV i2, with γ ≡ ρm as

Figure 2 shows hSi as a function of distance traversed inside the medium for

several temperatures. Note that, since we are assuming the body’s initial

kinetic energy to be higher than the average thermal energy, the body will

always lose energy to the medium, on average. This energy loss becomes

smaller and smaller as the body traverses the medium. Only after an inﬁnite

amount of time, or distance travelled, will the body’s average energy loss

reach zero, where a thermalization process will occur.

In summary, we have introduced and solved in closed form the dynamics of

a simple model of a body moving through a resistive medium. We ﬁnd that

6

the eﬀective resistive force is opposite and proportional to the square of the

body’s speed2.

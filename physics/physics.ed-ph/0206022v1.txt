Can we derive the Lorentz force from Maxwell’s equations?

The Lorentz force can be obtained from Maxwell’s equations in the Coulomb gauge provided
that we assume that the electric portion of the force acted on a charge is known, and the magnetic
component is perpendicular to the velocity of motion of the charged particle.

Strictly speaking, the Lorentz force can not be derived merely from Maxwell’s equations. To ﬁnd it, additional
postulates are needed. As you will see below, these postulates are too strong in order to view the procedure as a
derivation. However, the job is not useless. For, it helps us to comprehend the structure of classical electrodynamics.

We proceed from the general form of Maxwell’s equations

∇ · E = 4πρ

+ ∇ · (ρv) = 0

∇ · A = 0

which will be taken in the Coulomb gauge

The system (1)-(5) is not complete. For, it includes an uncoupled function v(x, t). From the physical point of view
the system of Maxwell’s equations describes only kinematics of motion of an electric charge. In order to close it up,
we must supplement (4) with a dynamic equation

∂σik
∂xk
where a stress tensor σik and the term f of an external force should be deﬁned. The portions of f are found from
the same Maxwell’s equations. Thus, the problem can be posed as follows: to deﬁne the minimal set of additional
assumptions and, using them, to extract f from (1)-(5). Before introducing new assertions we will do some preparatory
work for the second step of the problem.

Next, we will consider the system of two point electric charges at x1(t) and x2(t):

ρ(x, t) = q1δ(x − x1) + q2δ(x − x2)

v(x, t) = v1(t)I(x − x1) + v2(t)I(x − x2)

v1 =

v2 =

where δ(x) is the Dirac delta-function and I(x) the indicator function. Substituting (12) and (13) into (11) gives

Remark that in Maxwell’s equations the ﬁelds are the functions of x and t. After the above integration over the space
coordinate they become functions of x1(t) and x2(t). Let us extract from (14) cross terms. We have from Maxwell’s
equations for the electrostatic potential:

ϕ = ϕ1 + ϕ2

ϕ1 = q1φ(|x2 − x1|)

ϕ2 = q2φ(|x1 − x2|)

(q1ϕ2 + q2ϕ1) = q1ϕ2 = q2ϕ1

A = A1 + A2

A1 = q1v1α(|x − x1|)

A2 = q2v2α(|x − x2|)

where a function φ is written in variables after the integration. That gives for cross terms in the ﬁrst term of (14):

We have from Maxwell’s equations for the magnetic vector-potential:

where a function α is written in variables before the integration. Then we have for cross terms in the second term of
(14):

where ε0 and w0 are self-interaction terms. Expression (27) was obtained from Maxwell’s equations and it is a key
relation for further calculations.

Now, some assumptions will be done concerning the form of the force term f in (6). We postulate for the equation

of motion of a point charge

The last term in (24) means simply that the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity of motion. Multiply (28)
by v1:

APPENDIX A

In derivation of the integrals (7) and (8) we proceed from Maxwell’s equations (1) and (2).
To obtain (7) we take the curl of (1):

Multiply (2) by E and (A1) by ∇ × A. Summing up the results we get

∇ × A + c∇ × E = 0

Integrate (A2) over the whole space and take the second integral by parts supposing that the ﬁelds are vanishing at
inﬁnity. Then the respective integrals obtained from the second and ﬁfth terms of (A2) cancel each other. Thus we
come to (7) sought for.

In order to derive (8) we ﬁrstly operate (1) with ∂t:

Then exclude ∂E/∂t from (A3) and (2):

Multiply (A4) by ∂A/∂t:

Integrate (A5) over the whole space. Take the intergals of the second and third terms by parts. The third integral
vanishes due to (5). Thus we arrive at the relation (8) sought for.

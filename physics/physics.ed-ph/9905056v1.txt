Abstract

Using the post-Gaussian trial functions, we calculate the variational solutions to the

quantum-mechanical anharmonic oscillator. We evaluate not only the ground state

but also some excited energies, and compare them with numerical results.

1.

INTRODUCTION

The post-Gaussian trial function provides a robust instrument for obtaining the variational

solutions1,2 . By using the post-Gaussian trial function, one gets an excellent estimate for

the ground-state of the system. These results indicate the possibility for obtaining better

solutions for the potential problems, not only the ground state but also the excited states.

In this article, we examine the utility of the post-Gaussian trial wave functions. For this

purpose, we employ the anharmonic oscillator as an example. The anharmonic oscillator

has been given the useful laboratory to test a nonperturbative approximation. We also show

explicitly that the post-Gaussian variational method gives better solutions to the anharmonic

oscillator than the ordinary Gaussian one. This may give insight into a quantum-ﬁeld-

theoretical problem in the standard Gaussian variational approach to spontaneous symmetry

breakings.

In the following section, we solve the ground-state energy of the anharmonic oscillator

using the variational method with post-Gaussian trial wave function. In section 3, we cal-

culate some excited-state energy levels and compare the results with numerical calculations.

Section 4 is devoted to discussions. Throughout this paper all quantities and variables are

assumed to be made dimensionless for simplicity.

2. POST-GAUSSIAN VARIATIONAL METHOD AND THE GROUND STATE

The system we consider is the anharmonic oscillator. The Hamiltonian is written as follows:

To obtain the ground-state energy of H using the variational method, we employ a

Γ(z) is Euler’s gamma function of argument z. We notice that this trial function in Eq.(2)

has two variational parameters; i.e. α and n.

In the case of n = 1, this trial function

reduces to the familiar Gaussian trial function which is often taught in an elementary course

of quantum mechanics.

Using Eq.(2), we calculate the expectation value of the Hamiltonain as follows:

In Table 1., we show the numerical result for the ground state. The optimal value is found

to be at n = n0 = 1.13493 that indicates the wave function deviates from the Gaussian one.

3. THE EXCITED STATES AND THE NUMERICAL RESULTS

The ﬁrst excited state ψ(1) can be determind in such a way that the following orthogonality

condition is satisﬁed:

< ψ(0)(n0, α0)|ψ(1)(n0, β) >= 0,

where n0 and α0 are ﬁxed values of the variational parameters obtained in the previous

section and β is a new variational parameter. Then, using this trial function, we optimize

the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:

I (1)(β, n0) =< ψ(1)(n0, β)|H|ψ(1)(n0, β) > .

To ﬁnd the second excited state, we again optimize the expectation value of the Hamil-

tonian using another trial function ψ(2) which is orthogonal to both ψ(0) and ψ(1):

< ψ(0)(n0, α0)|ψ(2)(n0, γ) >= 0, < ψ(1)(n0, β0)|ψ(2)(n0, γ) >= 0,

(10)

where β0 is the ﬁxed value which make Eq.(9) optimal and γ is again a new variational

parameter. The same procedure stated above can repeatedly be applied to ﬁnd the higher

excited states.

Now, inspired by the harmonic-oscillator wave functions, we propose to take the following

trial functions for the excited states:

In Table 1., we compare the results of the post-Gaussian trial functions with the Gaussian

and numerical results3. As can explicitly be seen, the post-Gaussian trial functions always

give better results than those with the Gaussian trial functions.

4. CONCLUSIONS

We have applied the post-Gaussian trial functions to the anharmonic oscillators. We have

explicitly calculated up to the second excited state and compared the results with numerical

calculations. We have seen how the post-Gaussian trial functions give the better results

than the Gaussian wavefunctions.

Finally, we note that Cooper et al.4,5 have also discussed the variational energy eigenval-

ues for the anharmonic oscillator using the post-Gaussian trial functions. Their algorithm

to obtain the excited states is based on the idea of SUSY quantum mechanics6, whereas the

method we discussed here is the standard one known in elementary quantum mechanics.

Abstract

We consider the Schwinger’s method of angular momentum addition us-
ing the SU (2) algebra with both a fermionic and a bosonic oscillator. We
show that the total spin states obtained are: one boson singlet state and an
arbitrary number of spin-1/2 states, the later ones are energy degenerate. It
means that we have in this case supersymmetric quantum mechanics and also
the addition of angular momentum for massless particles. We review too the
cases of two bosonic and fermionic oscillators.

I. INTRODUCTION

The usual method for deﬁning the angular momentum in quantum mechanics is by means
of the commutation relations satisﬁed by its components Ji, i = x, y, z; and by solving the
eigenvalue problem for ~J 2 and Jz assuming that the components Ji are observables. From
this, the allowed values for the eigenvalues of ~J 2 and Jz, denoted j and m, respectively, are
j [1]. In this case
obtained. They run over the values: j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... and
SU(2)
the angular momentum operators Ji are the inﬁnitesimal generators for the SO(3)
algebra. The relation between spin and SU(2) symmetry is maintained in relativistic ﬁeld
theory since the little group for massive particles is just the rotation group [2,3]. For massive
spin-j particles we can always go to the rest frame, thus their spin degrees of freedom
transform according to a (2j + 1)-dimensional representation of SU(2), that is, we have
2j + 1 polarization states.

In the case of massless particles it is not possible to go to the rest frame, so the spin is
no longer described by SU(2). In this case the little group is the Euclidean ISO(2), denoted
also by E(2). This group consists of rotations by an angle φ around the z-direction (assuming
this as the direction of the motion) and translations in the Euclidean plane perpendicular to
the axis z. Its irreducible representations must either represent the translation by zero, or be
inﬁnite-dimensional. If χ is an eigenvector of the translation generators, eiφJz χ will be also
an eigenvector rotated by an angle φ. There is no room in physics besides the momentum
for another continuous quantum number, so physical massless particles correspond only to
the ﬁrst kind of representations (i.e., the trivial ones) [3]. This leaves only Jz as symmetry
operator, so the physical representations of E(2) are one-dimensional and labeled by the

. This is why the polarization states of a massless particle with
j. We can see this by considering the second Casimir invariant W µWµ =
spin j are only
M 2j(j + 1) (the other is p2 = M 2 > 0) where W µ is the Pauli-Lubanski pseudovector

Several years ago Schwinger worked out a connection between the algebra of angular-
momentum and two uncoupled bosonic oscillators [4]. The Schwinger’s scheme permits
to calculate the eigenvalues j and m, in terms of the operator number of the uncoupled
oscillators. The results agree with the general method for massive particles discussed above.
The case of massless particles, however, does not arise within the Schwinger’s scheme. So,
In this work we take a ﬁrst step to a more complete

generalization by considering one or more fermionic oscillators.

The outline of this work is the following. The Schwinger’s method which consists of two
bosonic oscillators (BB) is reviewed in Sec.II. Next, we generalize the scheme by considering
i) two fermionic oscillators (F F ) in Sec. III and, ii) one bosonic and one fermionic oscillator
(F B) in Sec. IV. In the last cases only spin zero and spin 1/2 are generated. In the last
section we show that in the BF case the spin 1/2 particles are inﬁnitely degenerated and
supersymmetric quantum mechanics naturally arises.

II. TWO BOSONIC OSCILLATORS (BB)

In this section we will brieﬂy review the Schwinger scheme [4,5] by considering two simple

bosonic oscillators with annihilation and creation operators ai and a†

(no summation).

We also assume that another pair of operators of the same oscillator or of diﬀerent oscillators
commute. It means that the two oscillators are uncoupled. Because N1 and N2 commute, we
can build up simultaneous eigenstates of N1 and N2 with eigenvalues n1 and n2, respectively.

If we associate spin up (m = 1/2) with one quantum unit of the N1 oscillator and spin
down (m =
1/2) with one quantum unit of the N2 oscillator, it is possible to imagine a spin
1/2 “particle” with spin up (down) with each quantum unit of the N1(N2) oscillator. The
eigenvalues n1 and n2 are just the number of spin up and spin down “particles”, respectively.
We will see that the association of half-integral spin with bosonic oscillators is necessary, if
we want to construct a general

state with j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, ... and

m

j.

Turning back to the J± operators deﬁned in Eqs. (6), we see that J+ destroys one unit
of spin down with the z-component of angular
1/2 and creates one unit of spin up with
the z-component of angular momentum +1/2. So, the z-component of angular momentum
is therefore increased by 1. Likewise J− destroys one unit of spin up and creates one unit
of spin down, the z-component of angular momentum is therefore decreased by 1. As for
the Jz operator, it simply counts 1/2 (¯h = 1) times the diﬀerence between n1 and n2, just
gives the z
component of the total angular momentum. Hence, the action of the J± and Jz
operators on the eigenstates of the

If j = m we have the largest eigenvalue for Jz

so we can imagine this state to be build up of 2j spin 1/2 particles with their spin all pointing
in the positive z-direction. Hence, as we said before, in this scheme an object of high j can
be visualized as being made up of primitive spin 1/2 “particles”, j + m of them with spin
up and the remaining j
m of them with spin down. This of course, does not mean that an
object of angular momentum j is a composite system of spin 1/2 particles. It means only
that, as far as the transformation properties are concerned, we can visualized any object of
arbitrary angular momentum j as a composite system of 2j spin 1/2 particles formed in the
manner indicated by Eq. (16). This is the well known Schwinger’s oscillator method [5].

III. TWO FERMIONIC OSCILLATORS (FF)

Let us consider two fermionic oscillators with annihilation and creation operators denoted

by Fi and F †

i , i = 1, 2. Then

Fi, F †

{

and any other pair of operators anticommuting. The number operators are deﬁned as usual
Ni = F †

i Fi, i = 1 or 2, and they satisfy

[Ni, Fj] =

Fi δij,

[Ni, F †

j ] = F †

i δij,

(no summation).

(19)

However, from Eq. (18) it follows that

Ni(Ni −

1) = 0,

i = 1 or 2;

so, the only eigenvalues of Ni, denoted by ni, are 0 or 1. The total number operator
N =

i Ni, has eigenvalues 0, 1 or 2.

P

As in the case of two bosonic oscillators, we can construct simultaneous eigenkets of
i and with the

N1 and N2. Eqs. (16) are valid but with the substitution ai →

which satisfy, as can be easily veriﬁed, the SU(2) commutation relations in Eq. (7). From
the point of view of the SU(2) algebra both cases, two bosonic oscillators and two fermionic
oscillators are equivalent. Notwithstanding ~J 2, deﬁned in Eq. (9), when written in terms of
the number operators, instead of Eq. (10) is given by

Since the eigenvalues of N1 and N2 can assume only the values 0 or 1, we see from Eq. (22)
that the respective eigenvalues for ~J 2 are 0 and 3/4. If we interpret these values in the form
j(j + 1), j
0, we see that only j = 0 and j = 1/2 are allowed. The eigenvalues of Jz
deﬁned in Eq. (21b) are 0, 1/2,

As in Sec. II the spins are along the z
direction and the eigenvalues n1 and n2 are just
the numbers of spins up and spins down, respectively. However, in the present case if
n1 = n2 = 0 the total spin is also zero; if n1 = n2 = 1 both spins are in opposite direction
and the total spin vanishes again. On the other hand, if n1 = 1, n2 = 0 the total spin is 1/2

IV. ONE FERMIONIC AND ONE BOSONIC OSCILLATORS (FB)

We have seen that both, the usual angular momentum addition and the Schwinger’s
scheme are valid for the case of massive particles [5]. The case of massless particles, however,
does not arise neither within the usual approach nor in the Schwinger’s scheme. So, the
method must be generalized.
In this work we take a ﬁrst step to get a more complete
generalization by considering one fermionic oscillator.

6

The interesting feature of the Schwinger’s scheme is that it allows us to obtain what are
the values of the weights or roots that are realized in the SU(2) algebra. For instance, in the
original work of Schwinger, all representations of the SU(2) algebra arise and it is exactly
equivalent, as we said before, to the theory of the angular momentum addition. This is
however a consequence of the bosonic nature of the oscillators. Notwithstanding, when both
oscillators are fermionic, although the algebraic relations are still valid the method does
not coincide with the usual addition of angular momentum in the sense that only restricted
values for the eigenvalues of the angular momentum operator are allowed: only two spinless
states and one spin-1/2 state are obtained and it is impossible to recover the full set of the
unitary representation of SU(2). This is a consequence of the fermionic character of the
operators with which we implement the realization of the SU(2) algebra [6]. On the other
hand, when one of the oscillators is bosonic and the other one is fermionic, a usual SU(2)
algebra is still realized but also in a restricted sense. This is the case that we will consider
here.

Let us consider the case of two oscillators, one of them a bosonic oscillator (a, a†) and

the other one a fermionic oscillator (F, F †). It means that

F, F †
n
and any pair of operators commutes if both of them are bosonic operators or, if one of them
is a bosonic operator and the other is a fermionic operator; they anticommute if both of
them are fermionic operators.

We see from Eqs. (31) and (33) that as in FF case, only spin 0 and 1/2 are generated.
However an interesting diﬀerence appears when one of the oscillators is bosonic as we will
see in the next section.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the equality ωB = ωF is imposed by
hand [7]. In the Schwinger’s scheme it is implicitly assumed that both oscillators have the
same frequency, ω. In the case of both one fermionic and one bosonic oscillator this implies
that ωB = ωF . It means that we have a symmetry of the combined bosonic and fermionic
oscillators, that is, we have a supersymmetry. In fact, using Eq. (30), we have

nB, nF i
So, we can identify Q = J+ and ¯Q = J− as the supersymmetry generators. Note that, in
fact, from Eqs.(27) and (28) we have

This commutation relation deﬁnes the Euclidean group E(2) and, as we mentioned in Sec. I,
it is well known that in the relativistic theory this is the little group related to massless
particles [3] and for this reason the polarization states of massless particles with spin j are
j. Thus we can interpret our result as follows: since we are in a non-relativistic
only
±
just one SU(2), only spinless and spin one-half particles are allowed to be
domain, i.e.
massless since in this case both 2j + 1 or
j degeneration coincide. From the point of view
of the angular momentum addition, a supersymmetric transformation

is equivalent to a parity transformation which makes j

If we consider SU(2)

SU(2)′, which corresponds to the relativistic case, we can have
massless states with j = 0, 1/2, 1 but not with j > 1. A way to overcome this problem is to
consider a two-component spinor ﬁeld as in Ref. [6] as we will show elsewhere.

Finally, we would like to pointed out that it may be interesting to considered these

extensions of the Schwinger scheme for SU(n) and also in relativistic ﬁeld theories [8].

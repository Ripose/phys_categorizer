A tool for teaching General Relativity

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

GRTensorJ - Books is an active interface to a small part of the computer algebra systems GRTen-
sorII (for Maple) and GRTensorM (for Mathematica) with the speciﬁc intent of providing students
of General Relativity with an advanced programmable calculator-style tool. All standard functions
associated with a classical tensor approach to the subject are available thus reducing these to “el-
ementary functions”. This is not a traditional database. The database entries are spacetimes and
calculations are done in real time. All spacetimes are referenced directly by equation number in
ten current (and classic) texts in notation as close as possible to the original text. The tool is now
available free of charge from grtensor.org/teaching .

I. MOTIVATION

Recently Hartle [1] has emphasized the increasing importance of General Relativity on the frontiers of both the
very largest and the very smallest distance scales, a fact reﬂected by the increasing number of undergraduate physics
majors being introduced to the subject. Of course, one can only learn physics by doing it, but many of the standard
functions of General Relativity, when taught through classical tensor methods, involve only partial diﬀerentiation and
summation. I believe that little is to be gained by repetitive routine calculations of this nature. For this reason, I
would like to introduce here a tool that will be of use for all students starting their study of General Relativity. The
purpose of the tool is to turn all standard (tensor based) functions into “elementary functions” - those immediately
available with the click of a button - so that the inner beauty of General Relativity shines through.

II. BACKGROUND

The tool described here involves and update [2] to the Java [3] interface GRTensorJ [4]. The workings of the
interface have been described in detail previously [5]. The version of GRTensorJ described here cannot be run over
the internet but rather is a local application. The interface currently covers every spacetime (referenced by equation
number and in notation as close to the original as possible) in the following texts:

TABLE I: Initial set of preprogrammed objects available for coordinate calculations (condensed). Note: “...” means that all
index combinations are immediately available as with Riemann.

III. PREPROGRAMMED CALCULATIONS

In addition to a complete help system, the initial set of preprogrammed objects available for coordinate calculations
is shown in TABLE 1. Note that the table is condensed as, for example, all index conﬁgurations are immediately avail-
able. Note also that context - sensitive mathematical information is embedded as explained below. The introduction
of further objects is also described below.

IV. LOADING A SPACETIME AND WORKING WITH IT

FIG. 1 shows a screen shot of the interface running Maple 10 [6] under Windows XP [7] and samples the coverage
associated with the classic text by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler. Assuming you have the text, you simply click on

3

the equation number to load the spacetime.

FIG. 2 shows loading of the Kruskal - Szekeres covering of the Schwarzschild vacuum as discussed by Poisson.
We use this example here because the coordinates are implicitly deﬁned and therefore involve constraints which can
be seen in the ﬁgure. Without these constraints the spacetime is not deﬁned. FIG. 3 shows the result of applying
constraints to the calculation of the Kretschmann scalar (see TABLE 1).

As mentioned above, the interface contains context - sensitive embeded mathematical information. An example is
shown in FIG. 4 where one notices that there are only four Ricci invariants available for calculation. The reason for
this is given in the explanation as shown in FIG. 5 [8].

V.

INTERFACE EXPANSION

At the time of writing, virtually any calculation one encounters in classical tensor analysis is already programmed
into the interface. Further routines can be easily added through the GRTensorII grdef and GRTensorM grdefine
facilities. This includes tetrad calculations which we do not discuss here. To see how to program the interface, let us
look at the construction of the Weyl-Schouten tensor (equivalently, the Cotton-York tensor which is also available).
This is a three index tensor which in three dimensions is zero if and only if the space is conformally ﬂat. As can be
see from TABLE 1, it is deﬁned by

W Sabc ≡ Rab;c − Rac;b − (gabRe

e;c − gacRf

f ;b)/4,

where the terms are deﬁned in the table. This relation is programmed into the interface by including a plain text ﬁle
(Weyl-Scouten.ts) the entire contents of which are:

grdef(‘WS{a [ b c ] }:=R{a b ; c}-R{a c ; b}-(g{a b}*R{^e e;c}-g{a c}*R{^f f ; b})/4‘);

grcalc(WS(dn,dn,dn));

VI. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

To run GRTensorJ - Books you need Java [3] installed on your computer and a version of Maple or Mathematica.
(You do not need to have GRTensorII or GRTensorM already installed.) The Maple version (tested on Maple 7, 8,
9, 9.5.2, 10 and student 10) for Windows (tested on 2000 and XP) is available now from grtensor.org/teaching.
Versions for other platforms, and updates, will be announced at the web site as they are available.

James Atkinson, Alex Johnstone and Reuble Mathew helped with the metric ﬁles but all errors are my responsibility.
This work was supported in part by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

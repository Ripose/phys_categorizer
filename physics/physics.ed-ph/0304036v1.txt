∗

We outline basic properties of a symmetric random walk in one dimension, in which the length
of the nth step equals λn, with λ < 1. As the number of steps N
, the probability that
the endpoint is at x, Pλ(x; N ), approaches a limiting distribution Pλ(x) that has many beautiful
features. For λ < 1/2, the support of Pλ(x) is a Cantor set. For 1/2
λ < 1, there is a countably
inﬁnite set of λ values for which Pλ(x) is singular, while Pλ(x) is smooth for almost all other λ
values. In the most interesting case of λ = (√5
g, Pg(x) is riddled with singularities and
−
is strikingly self-similar. The self-similarity is exploited to derive a simple form for the probability
measure M (a, b)

INTRODUCTION

This article gives a tutorial discussion of the properties
of random walks in one dimension in which the length of
the nth step changes systematically (speciﬁcally decreases
exponentially) with n. That is, at the nth step, a particle
hops either to the right or to the left with equal proba-
bility by a distance f (n), where f (n) is a monotonic but
otherwise arbitrary function. The usual nearest-neighbor
random walk is recovered when f (n) = 1 for all n.

Why should one care about random walks with vari-
able step lengths? There are several compelling reasons.
First, in the case of the geometric random walk (GW),
where f (n) = λn with λ < 1, a variety of beautiful and
unanticipated features arise [1, 2, 3, 4], as illustrated
in Fig. 1. A very surprising feature at ﬁrst glance is
that the character of the probability distribution of the
walk changes dramatically as λ is changed by a small
amount. Most of our discussion will focus on this in-
triguing aspect. We will particularly emphasize the case
λ = (√5
g, the inverse of the golden ratio,
where the probability distribution has a beautiful self-
similar appearance. We will show how many important
features of this distribution can be obtained by exploit-
ing the self-similarity, as well as the unique numerical
properties of g.

There are also a variety of unexpected applications of
random walks with variable step lengths. One such exam-
ple is the broadening of spectral lines in single-molecular
spectroscopy. As discussed in [5], the shift in the tran-
sition energy of a chromophore in a disordered solid can
be related to the displacement of a GW when f (n) is set
3. Another example is the motion of a Brow-
equal to n−
nian particle in a ﬂuid with a linear shear ﬂow, that is,
the velocity ﬁeld is vx(y) = Ay. As a Brownian parti-
cle makes progressively longer excursions in the
y di-
rections, the particle experiences correspondingly larger

velocities in the x-direction. This gives rise to an eﬀec-
tive random walk process in the longitudinal direction
in which the mean length of the nth step grows linearly
with n, i.e., f (n) = n. [6]. Finally, the GW provides an
instructive set of examples that can be analyzed by the
classical probability theory and statistical physics tools
[7, 8]. This can serve as a useful pedagogical supplement
to a student’s ﬁrst exposure to the theory of random
walks.

Historically, the GW has been discussed mostly in the
mathematics literature starting in the 30’s [1, 2]. The in-
terest in such random walks has recently revived because
of connections with dynamical systems [9, 10]. Recent
reviews on the GW can be found in Ref. [11]; see also
Ref. [12] for a review of more general iterated random
maps. On the other hand, there appears to be no men-
tion of the GW in the physics literature, aside from one
recent paper [13]. We hope that our exposition provides
a useful and historically accurate description of the GW
in a form that will be useful to physicists.

ometrically shrinking step lengths, that is, f (n) = λn,
with λ < 1. Here the probability distribution approach a
ﬁxed limiting form Pλ(x) = limN
Pλ(x; N ). We will
show that Pλ(x) exhibits rich behavior as λ is varied.

Roughly speaking, for almost all λ between 1/2 and
1, Pλ(x) is “smooth”, notwithstanding its singular vi-
sual appearance [14]. On the other hand, Erd˝os [2] ﬁrst
showed that there is a countably inﬁnite set of λ values,
given by the reciprocal of the Pisot numbers in the range
(1, 2), for which Pλ(x) is singular. It is still unknown,
however, if these constitute all of the possible λ values
for which Pλ(x) is singular.

geometrically as a walk whose ﬁrst step (of length 1) is
to the right and whose N subsequent steps are to the
left that returns exactly to the origin after N + 1 steps.

This positional degeneracy after N + 1 steps appears to
underlie the singularities in Pλ(x). The roots to this
equation give the sequence λ = (√5
0.618,
0.5437, 0.5188, 0.5087, 0.5041, etc., for N = 2, 3, . . ..
As we shall discuss below, the largest in this sequence,
λ = (√5
g (the inverse golden ratio), leads
to especially appealing behavior where the distribution
Pg(x) has a beautiful self-similarity as well as an inﬁnite
set of singularities in [2, 3, 9, 15, 16].

In Sec. II, we review basic facts about the GW for gen-

eral λ. In Sec. III, we treat the cases where λ = 2−
with m an integer. These admit an explicit exact solu-
tion in which the mth derivative of Pλ(x) is singular at
2m points. This behavior provides a useful preliminary
for understanding the singularities in Pλ(x) for the case
where λ = g (Sec. IV). For this case, we ﬁrst use ex-
act enumeration to determine Pg(x; N ) to N = 29 steps.
This enumeration provides an intricate portrait of Pg(x)
and clearly reveals its self similarity. We then exploit this
self-similarity, as well as symmetry, to obtain remarkably
simple results for the measure of Pg(x), namely, the in-
tegral of Pg(x) over a ﬁnite range. We believe that the
exact enumeration and the results about the measure are
original. We conclude in Sec. V.

II. GENERAL FEATURES OF THE
PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION

| ≤

x
|

To appreciate the qualitative nature of the GW proba-
bility distribution, Fig. 1 shows numerical simulations of
Pλ(x) for representative values of λ > 1/2. As we shall
discuss below, when λ is at the lower limit value of 1/2,
P1/2(x) = 1/4 for
2 and P1/2(x) = 0 otherwise. As
λ is increased, Pλ(x) develops a spiky appearance that
changes character from multiple local maxima to multiple
local minima as λ increases from 1/2 to approximately
0.61 (Fig. 1).
In spite of this singular appearance, it
has been proven by Solomyak [14] that Mλ is absolutely
continuous for almost all λ > 1/2. For λ > 0.61, Pλ(x)
rapidly smooths out and beyond λ >
0.7 there is little vi-
∼
3
sual evidence of spikiness in the distribution at the 10−
resolution scale of Fig. 1.

On the other hand, for λ < 1/2, the support of Pλ(x),
namely the subset of the real line where the distribution
is non-zero, is a Cantor set. To understand this phe-
nomenon, suppose that the ﬁrst step is to the right. Then
the endpoint of the subsequent random walk necessarily
lies in the region x > 0, even if all remaining steps are to
the left, since
λ) < 1. Thus the sup-
port of Pλ(x) divides into two non-overlapping regions
after one step. This same type of bifurcation occurs at
each step, but at a progressively ﬁner distance scale, and
therefore the support of Pλ(x) breaks up into a Cantor
set.

This property can also be demonstrated in a more pre-

This condition can not be used to determine the sup-

Jλ = [

the map (1) transforms Jλ into the union of the two non-
overlapping subintervals,

Restricting the map (1) to these two subintervals, we then
ﬁnd that they are transformed into four non-overlapping
subintervals after another iteration. Continuing this ad
inﬁnitum one thereby obtains a support for Mλ that con-
sists of a collection of disjoint sets that ultimately com-
prises a Cantor set [1].

On the other hand, for λ

1/2, the map again trans-
≥
forms Jλ into the two subintervals given in Eq. 5, but now
these subintervals are overlapping. Thus the support of
Pλ ﬁlls the entire range [

xmax, xmax].

III. EXACT DISTRIBUTION FOR λ = 2

−1/m

In this section, we derive Pλ by Fourier transform
1/m. As we illustrate below, these
methods for λ = 2−
cases turn out to be exactly soluble because of a set of for-
tuitous cancellations in the product form for the Fourier
transform of the probability distribution.

For a general random walk process, the probability
P (x; N ) that the endpoint of the walk is at x at the N th
step obeys the fundamental convolution equation [7, 8]

P (x; N ) =

P (x

x′; N

1) pN (x′).

(6)

This equation merely expresses the fact that to reach x at
the N th step the walk must ﬁrst reach a neighboring point
x′ to x on the
1 and then hop from x

out for employing Fourier transforms. Thus we introduce

and substitute these into Eq. (6). Note that these inte-
grals become discrete sums in the case of a random walk
that is restricted to integer-valued lattice points. The
Fourier transforms turn the convolution in x into a prod-
uct in k-space and (6) becomes the recursion

P (k; N ) = P (k; N

1) pN (k)

(7)

that can be iterated to give the formal solution

P (k; N ) = P (k; 0)

pn(k).

(8)

Generally, we consider the situation where the random
walk begins at the origin. Thus P (x; 0) = δx,0 and cor-
respondingly P (k; 0) = 1. Thus to compute P (x; N ),
we evaluate the product in Eq. (8) and then invert the
Fourier transform. This is the basic approach that we
will apply in the following.

To simplify the notation for the examples of this sec-
tion, we deﬁne Πm(x) = P2−1/m (x). We explicitly con-
sider the cases of m = 1, 2, and 3, from which the qualita-
tive behavior for general m can be surmised. The single-
step probability distribution at the nth step is

pn(x) =

[δ(x

λn) + δ(x + λn)],

and the corresponding Fourier transform is simply

pn(k) =

dx pn(x) eikx = cos(kλn)

The Fourier transform of the probability distribution af-
ter N steps is then the product of the Fourier transforms
of the single-step probabilities [8]. Thus for an N -step
walk

Pλ(k; N ) =

cos(kλn).

For the simplest case of λ = 2−

1, the step length sys-
tematically decreases by a factor of 2. By constructing
all walks of a small number of steps, it is easy to see that
the probability distribution is uniformly distributed on a
periodic lattice whose spacing shrinks by a factor of two
at each step. This is a precursor of the uniform nature

4

(10)

of Π1(x) in the N
limit. Algebraically, the product
in Eq. (9) can be simpliﬁed by using the trigonometric
half-angle formula to yield

Thus the inverse Fourier transform gives an amazingly
simple square-wave pulse Π1 = 1/4 on [
2, 2] and Π1 = 0
otherwise.

−

The distribution for λ = 2−

1/2 can be computed simi-
larly. The telescopic feature of Eq. (10) still occurs, lead-
ing again to a cancellation of successive factors in the
quotient. These become more evident by separating the
factors that involve sin(k/2j) and sin(k/2j+1/2). Then
following the same steps as those leading to Eq. (10), we
obtain the Fourier transform

Π2(k) =

sin(2k) sin(√2 k)

2k

√2 k

.

(11)

This product form has a simple interpretation in real
space. If we partition the walk into odd steps (1, 3, 5, . . .)
and even steps (2, 4, 6, . . .), then both the odd and even
1, but with the
steps are separately GWs with λ = 2−
initial step length of the odd walk equal to 1 and that
of the even walk equal to 1/√2. In real space, the full
1/2 is just the convolutions of the
distribution for λ = 2−
distributions of these two odd and even walks. Thus in
Fourier space, the full distribution is just the product of
the constituent distributions, as given in Eq. (11).

To invert the Fourier transform in Eq. (11) is straight-
forward but unwieldy, and the details are given in Ap-
pendix A. However, it is simpler to use the fact that the

λ = g. To visualize the ﬁne-scale details this probabil-

The basic problem in resolving Pg(x) is illustrated by
enumerating the ﬁrst few steps of the walk and repre-
senting them as the branches of an enumeration tree as
shown in Fig. 3. Neighboring branches of the tree can
rejoin because of the existence of 3-step walks (one step
right followed by two steps left or vice versa) that form
closed loops. For large N , accuracy in the position of
a walk is necessarily lost if we attempt to evaluate the

Thus the degeneracy of the tree will eventually be missed
by roundoﬀ errors, leading to ﬁne-scale inaccuracy in the
probability distribution.

However, we may take advantage of the algebra of the
golden ratio to reduce the N th-order polynomial in XN
to a ﬁrst-order polynomial. To this end, we successively
use the deﬁning equation g2 = 1
g to reduce all powers
of g to ﬁrst order. Applying this to gn itself gives the
simple formula gn = (
1)n(Fn
gFn), where Fn is the
−
nth Fibonacci number (deﬁned by Fn = Fn
2 for
n > 2, with F1 = F2 = 1). For the golden walk, we use
this construction to reduce the location of each endpoint,
N
n ǫngn, to an expression of the form A + Bg, where A
and B are integers. By this approach, each endpoint

location is obtained with perfect accuracy. The resulting
distribution is shown in Fig. 4 at various resolutions.

Perhaps the most striking feature of the endpoint dis-
tribution is its self-similarity, as sketched in Fig. 5. No-
tice, for example, that the portion of the distribution
within the zeroth sub-interval J 0 = [
g, g] is a mi-
crocosm of the full distribution in the interval J =
[
In fact, we shall see that the distribution
−
within J 0 reproduces the full distribution after rescal-
3 and the probability by a
ing the length by a factor g−
factor of 3. Similarly, the distribution in the ﬁrst sub-
interval J 1 = [g, 1 + g2] reproduces the full distribution
after translation to the left by 1, rescaling the length by
4 and rescaling the probability by 6. A similar con-
g−
struction applies for general subintervals.

To develop this self-similarity, it is instructive to con-
struct the symmetries of the probability distribution.
Obviously, Pg(x) is even in x. That is,

Pg(x) = Pg(

x).

The next symmetry is

for
x = 1 for the subset of walks with the ﬁrst step to the
right. We can ignore walks whose ﬁrst step is to the left
1 + g +
because the rightmost position of such walks is
g2 + . . . = g. Thus within a distance of g2 from x = 1,
only walks with the ﬁrst step to the right contribute to
this restricted distribution.

about the point that is reached when the ﬁrst k steps are
all in one direction. The kth symmetry applies within
< gk+1. We now exploit these symmetries
the range
to obtain a simple picture for the measure of the distri-
bution, Mg. We start by decomposing the full support
J into the contiguous sub-intervals that span the succes-
sive lobes of the distribution in Fig. 5: J 0 = (
g, g),
J 1 = (1
g3, 1 + g + g3), etc.;
there are also mirror image intervals to the left of the
origin, J −

C. Singularities

(22)

Another intriguing feature of Pg(x) is the existence of
the series of deep minima in the distribution. Consider,
for example, the most prominent minima at x =
g (see
Fig. 4). The mechanism for these minima is essentially
the same reason that g is sometimes termed the “most
irrational” real number – that is, most diﬃcult to approx-
imate by a rational number. In fact, there is only a single
trajectory in which the endpoint of the walk reaches g,
namely, the trajectory that consists of alternating steps,
g3 + . . .. Because of its exceptional nature,
1
there is a dearth of trajectories with nearby endpoints,
leading to a sharp minimum in the distribution.

More generally, this same mechanism underlies each of
the minima in the distribution including the singularity
as x
xmax. For each such location, the ﬁrst n steps
of the walk must be prescribed for the endpoint to be
within a distance of the order of gn to the singularity.

FIG. 5: Sketch to illustrate the symmetry and self-similarity
of Pg(x). The dashed curve is the probability distribution
when the ﬁrst step is to the right. The full probability distri-
bution is the sum of the dashed curve and an identical (but
shifted) curve that stems from the distribution when the ﬁrst
step is to the left. The measures associated with each lobe
of Pλ(x) (top) and the spatial extent of each lobe (bottom)
are indicated. Notice that the left extreme of the restricted
distribution coincides with the ﬁrst minimum of the full dis-
tribution.

For simplicity, we focus on the extreme point henceforth;
the argument for all the singularities is similar.

If the ﬁrst n steps are to the right, then the maximum
distance ∆ between the endpoint of the walk and xmax
arises if the remaining steps are all to the left. This gives
∆ = xmax −

Correspondingly, the total probability to have a random

For x near xmax, we make the fundamental assumption

power law behavior arises for the cases λ = 2−
discussed in Sec. III. We merely assume that power-law

this assumption, then the measure for being within the

This power law also occurs at each of the singular points
of the distribution because the underlying mechanism is
the same as that for the extreme points.

The same reasoning applies mutatis mutandis near the
extreme points for general λ, leading to the asymptotics
1+ln 2/ ln(1/λ). In particular, this gives, for
Pλ(∆)

the tail of Πm, the limiting behavior ∆m
with the exact calculation in Sec. III.

V. DISCUSSION

We have outlined a number of appealing properties
of random walks with geometrically shrinking steps in
which the length of the nth step equals λn with λ < 1.
Our aim is to help make physicists more aware of this very
beautiful and fascinating problem. We worked out the
1/m.
exact probability distribution for the cases λ = 2−
We also highlighted the beautiful self-similarity of the
probability distribution for the case where λ = (√5
−
1)/2. Here, the unique features of this number facilitate
a numerically exact enumeration method and also lead
to simple results for the probability measure.

Let us close with some suggestions for future work:

•

•

What is the eﬀect of a bias on the limiting proba-
bility distribution of the walk? For example, sup-
pose that steps to the left and right occur inde-
pendently and with probabilities p and 1
p re-
spectively. Among other things, it has been proven
[17] that the probability distribution is singular for
p and is continuous for almost all
λ < pp(1
larger values of λ. This is the analog of the tran-
sition at λ = 1/2 for the isotropic case. What else
can be determined about the anisotropic system?

p)1

−

−

−

Are there interesting ﬁrst-passage characteristics?
For example, what is the probability that a walk,
whose ﬁrst step is to the right, never enters the
region x < 0 by the nth step? Such questions
are of fundamental importance in the classical the-
ory of random walks [8] and it may prove fruitful
to extend these considerations to geometric walks.

8

Clearly, for λ < 1, this survival probability will
approach a non-zero value as the number of steps
. How does the survival probability con-
N
verge to this limiting behavior as a function of the
number of steps? Are there qualitative changes in
behavior as λ is varied?

→ ∞

•

What happens in higher spatial dimensions? This
extension was suggested to us by M. Bazant [18].
There are two natural alternatives that appear to
be unexplored.

One natural way to construct the GW in
higher dimensions is to allow the direction of
each step to be isotropically distributed, but
with the length of the nth step again equal to
λn. Clearly, if λ
1, the probability distribu-
tion is concentrated within a spherical shell of
radius 1 and thickness of the order of λ/(1
λ).
As λ is increased, the probability distribution
eventually develops a peak near the origin [18].
What is the nature of this qualitative change
in the probability distribution?

≪

−

Another possibility [19] is to require that the
steps are always aligned along the coordinate
axes. Then for suﬃciently small λ the support
of the walk would again consist of a fractal set,
such as a Sierpinski carpet, but on the plane.

Abstract

The momentum representation is seldom used in quantum mechanics courses.

Some students are thence surprised by the change in viewpoint when, in doing

advanced work, they have to use the momentum rather than the coordinate repre-

sentation. In this work, we give an introduction to quantum mechanics in momen-

tum space, where the Schr¨odinger equation becomes an integral equation. To this

end we discuss standard problems, namely, the free particle, the quantum motion

under a constant potential, a particle interacting with a potential step, and the

motion of a particle under a harmonic potential. What is not so standard is that

they are all conceived from momentum space and hence they, with the exception

of the free particle, are not equivalent to the coordinate space ones with the same

names. All the problems are solved within the momentum representation making

no reference to the systems they correspond to in the coordinate representation.

1. Introduction

commutation relation

In quantum mechanics the spatial position, ˆx, and the linear momentum, ˆp,

operators play very symmetrical roles, as it must be obvious from the fundamental

[ˆp, ˆx] = ˆpˆx

ˆxˆp =

i¯h

−

−

(1)

where, apart from a minus sign, the roles of ˆx and ˆp are the same. Notice that

a hat over the symbols has been used to identify operators. However, this funda-

mental symmetry is not apparent to many students of quantum mechanics because

an excessive emphasis is put on the coordinate representation in lectures and in

textbooks. Some students are even lead to think of the coordinate space wave

function ψ(x) as more fundamental, in a certain way, than its momentum space

counterpart φ(p); for, even in one of those rare cases where the Schr¨odinger equa-

tion is solved in momentum space, as is often the case with the linear potential

x (Constantinescu and Magyari 1978), many students feel that the quantum solu-

tion is somewhat not complete until the coordinate space wave function has been

found. This is a pity since a great deal of physical consequences are understood

better and many physical eﬀects are more readily evaluated in the momentum

rather than in the coordinate representation; as an example just think of scat-

tering processes and form factors of every kind (Taylor 1972, Ch 3; Frauenfelder

and Henley 1974; Bransden and Joachaim 1983; Griﬃths 1987). To give another

interesting example, let us remember the one-dimensional hydrogen atom, an ap-

parently simple system whose properties were ﬁnally understood, after thirty years

of controversy (Loudon 1959, Elliot and Loudon 1960, Haines and Roberts 1969,

Andrews 1976, Imbo and Sukhatme 1985, Boya et al. 1988, N´u˜nez-Y´epez et al.

1988, 1989, Mart´ınez-y-Romero et al. 1989a,b,c) only after an analysis was carried

out in the momentum representation (N´u˜nez-Y´epez et al. 1987, 1988, Davtyan et

al. 1987).

But, besides particular ocurrences, the advantages of an early introduction

to the momentum representation in quantum mechanics are manyfold: a) to em-

phasize the basic symmetry between the representations, b) to introduce from the

beginning and in a rather natural manner, distributions—pinpointing that the

eigenfunctions are best regarded as generalized rather than ordinary functions—,

2

non-local operators and integral equations, c) to help clarify the diﬀerent nature of

operators in both representations, for example, in the momentum representation

a free particle (vanishing potential in any representation) cannot be considered as

equivalent to a particle acted by a constant (in momentum space) potential, since

this last system admits a bound state. According to us the problems discussed in

this work make clear, using rather simple examples, the distinct advantages and

perhaps some of the disadvantages of working in the momentum representation.

2. Quantum mechanics in momentum space.

For calculating the basic properties and the stationary states of quantum

mechanics systems, the fundamental equation is the time-independent Scrh¨odinger

equation which, in the coordinate representation, can be written as the diﬀerential

eigenvalue equation

¯h2
2m

−

d2ψ(x)
dx2 + U (x)ψ(x) = Eψ(x).

This can be obtained using, in the classical Hamiltonian H = p2/2m + U (x), the
x [operators complying with (1)]. It

is equally possible the use of the alternative operator correspondence ˆp

straightforwardly as in the previous case— to the integral Schr¨odinger equation

dinate representation:

U (p) =

√2π¯h Z

exp(

ipx/¯h)U (x)dx.

−

As it is obvious from (3), in this representation the potential energy becomes an

integral operator (hence, usually non-local) in momentum space. Equations (2)

and (3) are, in fact, Fourier transforms of each other; therefore the relationship

between the coordinate and the momentum space wave functions is

(5)

Both functions, ψ(x) and φ(p), characterize completely and independently the

state of the system in question; although they diﬀer slightly in interpretation:

whereas ψ(x) is the probability amplitude that the a measurement of position

gives a value in the interval [x, x + dx], φ(p) is the probability amplitude that

a measurement of momentum gives a value in the interval [p, p + dp]. It should

be remarked that the normalization of a function in momentum space does not

guarantee the normalization of the corresponding function in coordinate space, for
this to be true you should multiply the transform of φ(p) times √2π¯h.

In spite of their complete equivalence, the momentum representation could

throw light in certain features that may remain hidden in the coordinate represen-

tation; very good examples of this are the SO(4) symmetry of the hydrogen atom

ﬁrst uncovered by Fock (1935) using his masterly treatment of the problem in the

momentum representation; or the treatment of resonant Gamow states in the mo-

mentum representation where they were found to be, contrary to what happens

in the coordinate representation, square integrable solutions to a homogeneous

Lippmann-Schwinger equation (Hern´andez and Mondrag´on 1984).

In this work we calculate the bound energy eigenstates and corresponding

quantum levels of the simplest one-dimensional potential problems in the momen-

tum representation. We choose to present them in order of increasing complexity,

as it is usually done in basic quantum mechanics:

1) The free particle with U (p) = 0.

2) Particle in a constant potential: U (p) =

−
3) Particle interacting with the potential step

please notice that as we assume α to be a real number, the i factor is necessary to

assure the Hermiticity of the potential energy operator.

4) Motion in the harmonic potential

U (p) =

−

(7)

where f0 > 0 and a are real numbers.

As we intend to illustrate in this contribution, in many instances the eigen-

functions are easier to calculate in momentum space than in the coordinate space

representation. We have to recognize though that the momentum space eigen-

states are best understood as generalized functions or distributions —to which the

Riemann interpretation of integrals does not apply; this is explicitly illustrated by

examples A, B, and D below. The energy eigenvalues are calculated, in most cases

discussed here (A, B, and D), as consistence conditions on the eigenfunctions, and

in the remaining one, C, from the univaluedness of the eigenfunctions.

3. The examples.

We want to point out that albeit we are addressing the same type of systems

that are used to introduce quantum mechanics, here we employ the same notion

of simplicity but with problems posed in momentum space (making them very

diﬀerent from the coordinate space ones). Please be aware that we use atomic

units wherever it is convenient in the rest of the paper: ¯h = e = m = 1.

A. The free particle.

In the case of the free particle, as in the coordinate representation, U (p) = 0

everywhere, so the Schr¨odinger equation (3) is simply

this deceptively simple equation has as its basic solutions

where pE is a solution of p2 = 2E and A is a constant. This is so since, according
to (8), the wave function vanishes excepting when the energy takes its “on shell”
value E = p2/2; furthermore as φ(p) cannot vanish everywhere, equation (9)
follows. The energy eigenfunctions (9) are also simultaneously eigenstates of the

function, hence on any physical state; therefore the eigenstates have to be regarded
as linear functionals acting on L2(R), the set of all square integrable functions.
The only physically meaningful way of dealing with free particles requires thus the

use of wave packets as follows

then, improper vectors, like those in (9), though very useful for formal manipula-

tions can never strictly represent physically realizable states (Taylor 1972, section

1a).

It is important to emphasize what we have shown: a constant potential in

momentum space admits a bound state. Obviously then in this representation we

have not the freedom of changing the origin of the potential energy by adding a

constant. In momentum space the potential energy is undetermined not up to a

constant value but up to a Dirac-delta function potential; that is, if you take an

arbitrary potential U (p) in momentum space, the physics of the problem is not
changed when you consider instead the modiﬁed potential U ′(p) = U (p) + γδ(p)
= U ′(p) does
with γ an arbitrary constant, whereas the change U ′′(p) = U (p) + γ
indeed change the physics. The reader can prove by herself this elementary fact.

This discussion is going forward apparently with no trouble; we have to ac-

knowledge though that for getting to the condition (18), we quickly passed over

a very important point, the integral of the right hand side of (17) does not exist

in the ordinary Riemann sense. To obtain our result you need to do it instead

in the distribution sense, regarding the momentum space function φ(p) as a lin-

ear functional acting upon square integrable functions, as corresponds to possible

state functions of a quantum system. Such idea is also behind the usefulness of

the delta functions as generalized basis for the free particle states in example A.

To particularize to the present situation, this amounts to make ˆϕ convergent

(hence meaningful) when acting on any state function (Richtmyer 1978, B¨ohm

1979). A direct way of accomplishing this is, as usually done in theoretical physics

(Taylor 1972, Frauenfelder and Henley 1974, Griﬃths 1987), to get the mentioned

integral come into existence in a principal value sense (Mathews and Walker 1970).

To this end ﬁrst multiply the right hand side of (17) times an exp(

iǫ p) complex

factor, then perform the integral using contour integration in the complex plane

and, at the very end, take the limit ǫ

0. With such provisos considered, it is not

−

diﬃcult getting the result (18). However, this means that the functions involved in

our discussion have to be considered as linear functionals or generalized functions,

as can be done—perhaps it would be better to say: should be done—for every

wave function of a quantum system (Messiah 1976, B¨ohm 1979); forgetting this

fact can produce erroneous results as it is exempliﬁed by the case discussed in

→

(N´u˜nez-Y´epez and Salas-Brito 1987).

It is to be noted that the free particle potential acts as a conﬁning potential

in momentum space; it allows, for each—out of a nonnegative continuum—energy

value, just two choices for the momentum:

; such extreme restriction

and

pE|

|

pE|

−|

is also reﬂected in the wave functions, they are Dirac delta functions which peak

at the just quoted values of p. On the other hand, the constant potential, which

does not restrict the possible values of the momentum in the severe way of the

zero potential, is not as conﬁning in momentum space and allows a single energy

eigenvalue whose associated eigenstate requires a very wide range of momenta

[given in (19)] to exist. At this point we invite the reader to try to solve the

problem of a particle inside an inﬁnite potential box—in momentum space. This

is a simple and nice exercise to test the intuition on the diﬀerences between the

8

momentum and the coordinate representation; it is not diﬃcult to conclude that,

in this case, the eigenfunctions are also Dirac delta functions with a lightly but

subtly modiﬁed relation linking energy and momentum.

C. Motion in a potential step

In this case U (p) is given in (6). Using such potential, the Schr¨odinger equa-

tion becomes a simple Volterra integral equation

p2

To solve this equation, we derive both members and, using k2
a very simple diﬀerential equation

whose solution is

with A an integration constant.

The energy eigenvalues follow, not from a consistency condition as in the last

example, B, but from the requirement that the eigenfunctions be single valued.

This is only possible if α/k0 takes nonnegative integer values (Churchill 1960), i.e.

if k0 = α/n, n = 1, 2, . . ., the value n = 0 is not allowed for φ(p) would vanish

identically in that case (N´u˜nez-Y´epez et al. 1987). Thus, the system has an inﬁnite

number of bound energy eigenstates with energies given by

En =

α2
2n2 , n = 1, 2, . . . ;

−

the normalization of the eigenfunctions requires that A = (2α3/n3π)1/2 in equation
(22).

A very important property of the eigenfunctions is

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

this is required to guarantee the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian operator of the

problem (Andrews 1976, N´u˜nez-Y´epez et al. 1987, Salas-Brito 1990). We pinpoint

that the potential step in momentum space is particularly interesting because it is

closely related to the study of the momentum space behaviour of electrons interact-

ing with the surface of liquid helium, with the properties of the an hydrogen atom

in superstrong magnetic ﬁelds, and with certain supersymmetric problems (Cole

and Cohen 1969, Imbo and Sukhatme 1985, N´u˜nez-Y´epez et al. 1987, Mart´ınez-y-

Romero et al. 1989c, Salas-Brito 1990).

D. Motion under a harmonic potential

Let us, as our ﬁnal example, study the motion of a particle under the har-

monic potential U (p) =

f0 cos(ap), where a and f0 > 0 are real constants. The

Schr¨odinger equation is then

(25)

By changing p for

p in (25) we can show that the Hamiltonian commutes with

the parity operator, thus its eigenfunctions can be chosen as even or odd functions,

−

i.e. as parity eigenstates.

For solving (25), let us deﬁne k2

2E and, using the identity 2 cos x =

exp(ix) + exp(

ix), we easily obtain the eigenfunctions as

−

≡ −

(cid:2)
where the numbers ˇϕ± are deﬁned by

φ(p′)dp′.

As in the constant potential (example B), the energy eigenvalues follow from using

the deﬁnitions (27) back in the eigenfunctions (26)—please remember that we

require the functions (26) be regarded as in example B, for doing the integrals

(27). The integrals gives us the following two conditions

(26)

(27)

(28)

ˇϕ+ =

[ ˇϕ+ + ˇϕ− exp(

2ak)],

ˇϕ− =

[ ˇϕ− + ˇϕ+ exp(+2ak)].

As the eigenfunctions can be chosen as even or odd, we can select the numbers ˇϕ±

to comply with ˇϕ+ =

ˇϕ−, so the eigenfunctions are

which correspond to the complete set of eigenfunctions of the problem.

From (28) we also get the two equations determining the energy eigenvalues

4. Concluding remarks

We have discussed four instructive one-dimensional examples in quantum me-

chanics from the point of view of momentum space. Purportedly we have not made

any reference to the problems they represent in the coordinate representation. We

expect to contribute with our approach to the development of physical insight

for problems posed in the momentum representation and, furthermore, to help

students to understand the diﬀerent features of operators, as opposed to classical

variables, in diﬀerent representations. We also expect to made clear that some-

times it is better to treat a problem from the momentum space point of view since

11

the solution can be simpliﬁed. The point at hand is the simple form in which

the momentum space eigenfunctions are obtained in the problems discussed here;

though these have to be regarded as distributions for obtaining the associated

energy eigenvalues.

With goals as the mentioned in mind and to point out other advantages of the

momentum representation, in a formal set of lectures and depending on the level

of the students, it may be also convenient to discuss more complex problems: as

scattering and dispersion relations (Taylor 1972), or the study of resonant states as

solutions of a Lippmann-Schwinger equation in momentum space (Hern´andez and

Mondrag´on 1984), or the 3D hydrogen atom, whose solution using Fock’s method

is nicely exposed in (Bransden and Joachaim 1983).

Just in the case you are wondering and have not found the time for doing

the transformations yourself, let us say that the problems, save the free particle,

we have posed and solved in this paper are known, in the coordinate representa-

tion, as 1) the attractive delta potential (Example B), 2) quantum motion under

the (quasi-Coulomb) potential 1/x (Example C) and, ﬁnally, the problem of two
πf0/√2), symmetrically placed, attractive delta function

equal (intensity: A =

−

potentials, which are displaced by 2a from one another (Example D).

and used α = 1). The critical value of f0, giving birth to the excited state, is
0 = (4aπ)−1 as can be obtained from the equality of the slopes of the two

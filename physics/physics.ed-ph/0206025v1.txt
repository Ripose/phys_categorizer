“Bernoulli” levitation is the basis of many popular counter-intuitive physics demonstrations.
However, few of these lend themselves to a quantitative description without recourse to
computational ﬂuid dynamics. Levitation of a ﬂat plate is the exception, and we present
here a straightforward analysis which illustrates several principles of ﬂuid mechanics in a
pedagogically useful way.

Abstract

1

Introduction

The reduction of pressure in a moving stream of ﬂuid is commonly called the Bernoulli
Eﬀect. It can be simply and dramatically demonstrated by blowing air into the narrow end
of a small funnel. A ping-pong ball placed in the funnel cannot be blown out; the harder
one blows, the more it sticks in place. A quantitative description of this demonstration is
not easy however, due to the complicated geometry and airﬂow.

To avoid these complexities, we have produced produced a version of this demonstration
which is even more dramatic than the ping-pong ball, and yet lends itself to a quantitative
description. Air is blown vertically downwards through a hose which exits in a ﬂat horizontal
sheet. Another ﬂat sheet brought up to the oriﬁce will be held in place despite the fact
that the air is pushing downwards. The acceleration of the air in the gap causes a drop in
pressure which more than compensates for the high pressure in the hose. Flowing liquids
will also produce the same eﬀect, as one can easily show using a ﬂat sheet placed against a
water jet in a swimming pool or hot tub.

Our design (ﬁgs. 1 and 2) was fabricated from 3/8” acrylic sheet, a material chosen for
its transparency and the smoothness of its surface. The design is not original; it probably
exists in thousands of versions. The authors were inspired by an exhibit at the Pearson Air
Museum in Vancouver, Washington[1]. What we show here is that the system is amenable
to a fairly straightforward analysis which illustrates various principles of ﬂuid motion.

The source of air is an outlet of a common half-horsepower shop vac (which has never
been used for cleaning). The nozzle (inner radius rhose = 14 mm) is inserted into a hole
in a horizontal sheet of acrylic, blowing downwards. The edge of the hole is rounded with
an approximately 1 mm radius of curvature. A ﬂat disk of 3/8” acrylic (radius 150 mm)
brought up to the hole at ﬁrst experiences a strong downward force, but on being pushed

closer it is suddenly grabbed by the air ﬂow and held in place about 1 mm below the ﬁxed
sheet of acrylic. This arrangement can levitate approximately 2 kg. In our apparatus, the
pressure can be measured in the hose and at three diﬀerent radii above the suspended plate.
The most important two pressures to measure are the one in the hose and that just outside
the hose radius, where the air velocity is the highest and the pressure the lowest. It is the
thin disk of high velocity air just outside the hose which is responsible for the levitation.
The pressures are displayed by two large analog gauges, chosen for visual eﬀect. The hose
pressure is controlled using a Variac power supply for the shop vac.

2 The Calculation

The air ﬂows relatively slowly down the hose and then is forced into the small gap above the
plate. Mass conservation dictates that the air speeds up considerably here, and Bernoulli’s
equation gives the associated pressure drop.

1.24kg/m2 (in our cool laboratory), velocity v, height h and
The pressure is P , density ρ
the gravitational acceleration is g. The velocities are calculated from conservation of mass.
As we will see, a typical value of P is several kPa and v > 10 m/s, and so the last terms
involving height variations of a few cm can be safely ignored. As will be demonstrated
below, the ﬂow is turbulent and so has no thick boundary layer. Hence the air velocity
is approximately uniform across the width of the channel. The velocity leaving the hose
approaches 200 m/s. This is rather larger than Mach 0.3 (
100 m/s), which is usually
considered to be the velocity above which compressibility has to be taken into account. We
shall show the small but signiﬁcant eﬀects of compressibility.

For the ﬂow between the two plates, consider a wedge of air between as shown in Fig. 2a.
Its radial extent is from r to r + dr, azimuthal extent δ, and a constant thickness x. Air
ﬂows through the wedge at rate of dq kg/s from left to right, entering with velocity v and
pressure p and leaving with velocity v +dv and pressure p+dp. We can solve the momentum
equation for the wedge by considering the two forces, one from the pressure diﬀerence and
one from wall friction, which cause the acceleration of the air passing through. The force
due to air pressure acts on the four sides of the wedge. On the left hand edge the total force
is:

Here the positive direction is to the right and the factor 2 sin δ
of curvature. Similarly, the force on the right hand edge is:

The force due to wall friction is given in terms of the friction factor f , which can be applied
to ﬂow between ﬂat plates as follows[2]:

The friction factor can be either be read oﬀ a Moody Chart if the Reynolds number is
ﬁxed and known, or the factor can be calculated from the unlikely empirical expression for
turbulent ﬂow[2] which is plotted in ﬁg. 4:

The ﬂuid density, viscosity and velocity are given by ρ, µ and v. As the variation of the
friction factor f with Re is logarithmic, we will use this approximation throughout. The
Reynolds number varies by an order of magnitude (2,000-20,000) in this system, but f only
varies between 0.02 and 0.05. For the most important region of ﬂow, just outside the hose,

0.023.

The rate of change of momentum of air passing through the wedge can be found using the

The total mass ﬂow q = 2πrxρv, and the incremental velocity change dv is simply related

The subscript a here refers to ambient values, and γ can be set to 1 for isothermal den-
sity variations and 1.4 for adiabatic variations. In practice, there is very little discernible
diﬀerence between these two cases.

The pressure was integrated numerically using radial steps of 0.1 mm starting at the hose
radius. At each step the friction factor was evaluated from the local Reynolds number.
The calculation was done in Excel, using the “solver” utility to ﬁnd the right value of the
total ﬂow rate q for a measured hose pressure which yielded the ambient pressure as the air
left the channel. The gap size was then varied and the total force on the plate was found.
The minimization procedure was often not straightforward. In some cases quite diﬀerent
solutions could be found using diﬀerent starting guesses; the maximum pressure changes
sometimes diﬀered by as much as 10%, and the force on the plate by several Newtons. This
may be due to the fact that the force in the plate is, in reality, quite a small diﬀerence
between two much larger forces on either side.

3 Levitation Measurements

The acrylic plate we used for levitation had a mass of 785 g (769 N). Sometimes an additional
1 kg mass was added, which was the limit for the shop vac used. Measurements of the gap
were taken at various hose pressures (3-10 kPa). The plate was stable enough to use a
simple Feeler gauge. Pressure measurements were made at a radius of 20 mm, close to the
minimum pressure region. The ambient temperature was 5C and the pressure 100 kPa.

A problem encountered in the measurements is a rocking motion at a few Hz caused by the
fact that the plate is only supported by a thin ring of air just outside the hose radius. This
can be cured after onset by lightly touching the plate with a ﬁnger. It could presumably
be reduced by using a smaller plate.

A interesting eﬀect occurs when the additional mass of 1 kg is hung from the plate. With
this weight, the plate tends to ﬂoat crookedly, with a gap of 1.55 mm on one side and
1.95 mm on the other. This is presumably a kind of Euler instability which bears further
investigation in the future.

4 Comparison of Data and Calculations

±

Figs. 5-7 show calculations made with a representative hose pressure of 8 kPa. At this
pressure the gap was measured to be x = 1.00
0.05 mm. Fig. 5 shows how the pressure
distribution depends on diﬀerent assumptions. The calculation which best reproduces the
total upward force on the plate (769 N) is the isothermal approximation with the nominal
friction factor and a 1.1 mm gap. The adiabatic approximation yields an almost identical
result, and the measurements cannot distinguish between the two. However, an incom-
pressible ﬂow yields a slightly broader, shallower pressure proﬁle and requires a larger gap
(1.3 mm) to obtain the right force. This is not so consistent with the data as the isother-
mal/adiabatic case. Also shown in the plot is the frictionless case for a 1.1 mm gap, which
gives almost double the measured pressure drop and four times the upward force.

Fig. 6 shows the air velocity as the air exits the hose. The gap is 1.1 mm and the ﬂow
isothermal. The velocity peaks at almost 200 m/s shortly after entering the gap. At the
same place, the pressure reaches a minimum of -10 kPa, as seen in ﬁg. 5. The Reynolds
number distribution with radius is shown in ﬁg. 7; the peak value is nearly 30,000.

The gap measurements are presented in ﬁg. 8, with and without the extra 1 kg mass
suspended under the ﬂoating plate. The agreement with the calculation is good, although
the small non-linearity in the theoretical curves is most likely a result of the calculational
problems noted above, and not a real physical eﬀect.

There is a second, larger gap size which produces a small upward aerodynamic force suﬃcient
to lift the plate. However this position is unstable as the upward force rises as the gap size
is reduced, and so it cannot be used for levitation. Experimentally it occurs at around
7 mm. One can easily estimate this gap size by requiring that the cross-sectional area
x
does not change between the hose and the channel between the plates:

∼

πr

2
hose = 2πrhosex ;

i.e. x = rhose/2 = 7 mm

(13)

In this case there can be no drop in pressure above the plate, and the force will be zero. A
small decrease in this gap will support the plate in unstable equilibrium.

We have produced a simple and spectacular demonstration of Bernoulli levitation which
can be used in front of a large audience. We have shown that it is possible, simply by using
momentum conservation and common friction factors, to account quantitatively for all the
main features of the demonstration.

Abstract

The spin-statistics connection is obtained in a simple and elementary way for general causal

ﬁelds by using the parity operation to exchange spatial coordinates in the scalar product of a

locally commuting ﬁeld operator, evaluated at position x, with the same ﬁeld operator evaluated

at −x, at equal times.

INTRODUCTION

Proofs of the spin-statistics theorem tend, broadly speaking, to fall into two classes. The

ﬁrst class, historically, depends upon analytic properties of ﬁeld operator commutators.1,2,3,4

The second class invokes topological arguments. Proofs in this latter class variously use

homotopies in conﬁguration space for identical particles5,6,7,8,9 or arguments involving adi-

abatic exchange of particles carrying topological markers.10,11 The proof by Schwinger12

stands apart from both classes in exploiting the discrete symmetry of time-reversal.

The use, on the one hand, of the exchange of identical particles in the topological theo-

rems, and, on the other, of a discrete symmetry applied to a scalar invariant (the Lagrangian

density of a ﬁeld) in Schwinger’s proof, suggests using another discrete symmetry, parity, to

examine the eﬀect of exchanging particle coordinates by passive transformations. This note

presents a simple demonstration of the spin-statistics connection based upon that idea. The

proof is elementary, and in essence algebraic.

II. PARITY AND CAUSAL FIELDS

Irreducible representations of the Poincar´e group are classiﬁed according to eigenvalues of
two angular momentum-like inﬁnitesimal generators A and B.1,4,13,14,15 The (A,B) represen-

tation contains multiple spin angular momentum quantum numbers |A − B| ≤ j ≤ A + B.

General ﬁelds are built up from the (A, B) representations. Familiar examples include the

(0, 0) scalar ﬁeld, and the ( 1

2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1

2 ) Dirac ﬁeld.

Let a spin j massive ﬁeld Ψ(AB) be an element of a given (A,B) representation. The

construction of this object is given in Refs.14,16. Applying the parity operation P gives13

The intrinsic parity ηP of the ﬁeld is ±1. The action of P has no eﬀect on spin, and assumes

nothing regarding statistics.

III. SPIN AND STATISTICS: WEINBERG FIELDS

Before considering the general case, the method of proof is worked out for the simpler

case of (j, 0) representations, sometimes called Weinberg ﬁelds.17 Deﬁne the ﬁeld operator

ξσ ≡ Ψ(j0)

σ

(2)

where σ runs from −j to j. The ﬁeld ξσ(x) annihilates a spin j particle (or creates an

antiparticle) localized at spacetime point x, with z-projection of angular momentum σ.

It will be shown that imposing local commutativity on ξ leads to the spin-statistics

connection. Consider the ﬁeld ξ evaluated at two points in spacetime separated by spacelike

interval. A Lorentz frame exists in which the two points occur at equal time, so we may
write the ﬁelds as ξ(x, t) and ξ(−x, t). The eﬀect of P on their scalar product is, according

to Eq (1) for A = B = 0,

P ξ(x, t) · ξ(-x, t)P −1

= P ξ(x, t)P −1 · P ξ(-x, t)P −1

= ξ(−x, t) · ξ(x, t)

Equation (3) is the product of two quantities with the same parity, and is thus an even
parity scalar function of x. Considered as a function of x, an even parity scalar operator
obeys P f (x)P −1 = f (x), thus

ξ(x, t) · ξ(−x, t) = ξ(−x, t) · ξ(x, t).

The product on the right-hand side of Eq (4) is the scalar product of two irreducible

spherical tensors of the same rank. It is given by18,19

ξ(−x, t) · ξ(x, t) =

(−1)σξσ(−x, t)ξ−σ(x, t).

By hypothesis, commutation relations of a causal ﬁeld (− for Bose, + for Fermi) vanish

outside the light cone; in particular20

[ξσ(x, t), ξλ(−x, t)]∓ = 0

Therefore,

ξ(−x, t) · ξ(x, t) = ±

(−1)σξ−σ(x, t)ξσ(−x, t),

we obtain for Eq (4)

ξ(x, t) · ξ(−x, t) = ±(−1)2jξ(x, t) · ξ(−x, t).

(10)

Take the matrix element of both sides of Eq (10) between the vacuum and a state with
one quantum of the ﬁeld ξ localized at x with z-value of its spin equal to ρ and one quantum
at -x, with spin z-value −ρ. Eq (10) becomes

hV AC|ξρ(x, t)ξ−ρ(−x, t)|(+x, t; +ρ)(−x, t; −ρ)i =

±(−1)2jhV AC|ξρ(x, t)ξ−ρ(−x, t)|(+x, t; +ρ)(−x, t; −ρ)i

(11)

By hypothesis, a ρ exists for which the matrix element is nonvanishing, allowing us to

conclude

1 = ±(−1)2j,

(12)

which is the connection between spin and statistics.

IV. SPIN AND STATISTICS: GENERAL FIELDS

The argument just given is readily extended to the case of the general (A, B) representa-

tion. The ﬁeld ξ(AB)

mn now carries two indices −A ≤ m ≤ A and −B ≤ n ≤ B, and the scalar

product in Eq (5) is replaced by an expresson that couples two (A, B) spherical tensors to a

(0, 0) scalar, in an extension of Racah’s19 original derivation of Eq (5), which now becomes

(retaining the dot product notation)

where σ = m + n, and the objects in parentheses are Wigner 3j symbols. By Eq (1) for the

(0,0) representation, the result of applying P to Eq (13) once again gives Eq (4). Both the

spin j and summation index σ are half-integral if and only if one of A and B is half-integral.

Therefore, Eq (10) holds for the general (A, B) representation, and taking the matrix element
of Eq (10) between the vacuum and a suitable state |(x, t; µ, ν)(−x, t; −µ, −ν)i gives, again,

the proper spin-statistics connection.

Abstract. The scattering properties of quantum particles on fractal potentials at
diﬀerent stages of fractal growth are obtained by means of the transfer matrix method.
This approach can be easily adopted for project assignments in introductory quantum
mechanics for undergraduates. The reﬂection coeﬃcients for both the fractal potential
and the ﬁnite periodic potential are calculated and compared. It is shown that the
reﬂection coeﬃcient for the fractal has a self-similar structure associated with the
fractal distribution of the potential.

A transfer matrix method for the analysis of fractal quantum potentials

1. Introduction

Both quantum mechanics and elementary solid state physics courses illustrate the energy
band structure in solids through the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney model that consists
of a periodic conﬁguration of square-well potentials [1, 2]. This problem is usually
solved by matching the boundary conditions of the wavefunctions at the cell boundaries,
thus requiring the computation of the determinant of a 4
4 matrix [3]. Recently,
some less tedious approaches have been proposed which usually can be readily adapted
to ﬁnite periodic potentials [4]. Among these methods, those based on the transfer
matrix approach which only uses 2
2 matrix operations in a purely algebraic way
are the most appropriate ones for beginners [5]. Moreover, this method allows to
introduce a numerical method based on a piecewise constant approximation [6] for a
general potential, the analysis of defects on slightly aperiodic potentials, and even the
consideration of more complicated potentials. Among the last, fractal potentials is the
one which we considered here.

In recent years the study of fractals has attracted much attention because many
physical phenomena, natural structures and statistical processes can be analyzed and
described by using a fractal approach [7, 8]. From a mathematical point of view, fractals
are self-similar structures obtained by performing a basic operation, called generator,
on a given geometrical object called initiator, and repeating this process on multiple
levels; in each one of them, an object composed of sub-units of itself is created that
resembles the structure of the whole object. Mathematically, this property should hold
in all scales. However, in the real world, there are lower and upper bounds over which
such self-similar behavior applies. Fractals are becoming a useful tool to be able to
model diverse physical systems [9, 10], and have new technological applications [11, 12].
In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, fractals have been used to generate new
solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation which are continuous but nowhere diﬀerentiable
wave functions [13], and models for the so-called fractal potentials [14]. Fractal
potentials allow the analysis of quasi-periodic and nearly stochastic potentials using
the symmetries induced by the self-similar structure of the potential. Here we consider
the simplest fractal, the (triadic) Cantor set, as a fractal potential for quantum
scattering [15] and tunnelling [16, 17].

In this paper, we present a simple transfer matrix method to obtain the scattering
properties of Cantor set fractal potentials, which can easily be automated by computers.
The present method makes easier for the comparison with the ﬁnite periodic case and
shows how the reﬂection coeﬃcient for the fractal case has a self-similar structure
associated with the fractal distribution of the potential. Moreoever, it can be easily
implemented in any computer language, e.g., the Mathematica software package,
accesible to undergraduate students with only a basic programming experience, so that
it can be adopted for project assignments in computer physics courses. Starting with the
implementation of the transfer matrix method for a potential barrier, the extension to
ﬁnite periodic potential is a straightforward one; its extension to Cantor set potentials

can be based on a recursive implementation, involving the possible improvement of
student programming skills. Furthermore, these projects can introduce the students to
the analysis of computational complexity of algorithms, since the Cantor set prefractal
has a large number of potential barriers and its simulation requires an exponential
number of matrix products.

This paper is organized as follows: The next section describes the main facts about
the transfer matrix method for quantum scattering implemented by piecewise constant
potentials. In Section 3, the reﬂection coeﬃcient for the tunnelling on both the ﬁnite
periodic potential as well as the Cantor set pre-fractals are determined and compared.
Finally, the last section is devoted to the conclusions.

The simplest fractal potential is the Cantor set, shown in Figure 3(b), which can be
obtained by means of an iterative construction. The ﬁrst step (S = 0) is to take a
segment of unit length. The next one (S = 1) is to divide the segment in three equal
parts of length 1/3 and remove the central one. In general, at the stage S, there are 2S
segments of length 3−S with 2S
1 gaps in between. Stage S + 1 is obtained by dividing
each of these segments into three parts of length 3−S−1 and removing the central ones.
In Figure 3(b), only the four ﬁrst stages are shown for clarity. Note that the S-th stage
Cantor set pre-fractal can be interpreted as a quasiperiodic distribution of segments
which can be obtained by removing some segments in a ﬁnite periodic distribution as
shown in Figure 3(a). This distribution at stage pM has (3M
1)/2+1 potential barriers

of length 3−M , separated by potential wells of the same length, so the “period” of this
ﬁnite structure is Λ = 2

3−M .

The scattering problem for both the quasiperiodic, Cantor set, pre-fractal potential,
and the ﬁnite periodic potential can be easily solved by means of the matrix transfer
theory presented in Sec. 2. It is standard to normalize both the energy and the height
of the potential barrier by the period Λ, introducing the non-dimensional variables

and

Figures 4 and 5 show the reﬂection coeﬃcient, R, for the ﬁnite periodic potential
and Cantor set fractal potential, respectively, around the interval which contains the ﬁrst
band gap of the inﬁnite periodic one. Using the standard Kronig-Penney model [19], this
band gap can be numerically calculated yielding 3.2519 < φ < 3.6222 for the potential
φV = 2. In this energy interval, a Bloch wavefunction does not propagate in a inﬁnite
periodic potential and, therefore, the transmission coeﬃcient should vanish (R = 1).
Only evanescent wavefunctions characterized by a complex wavevector, k, are solutions
of the Schr¨odinger equation. For this reason, when the number of periods is ﬁnite, the
quantum particle may pass through the potential distribution by the tunnelling eﬀect.
Figure 4 shows that the reﬂection coeﬃcient approaches unity as the number of periods
in the spatial interval increases, illustrating the process of appearance of the band gap
of the (full) periodic structure. Although, at the graphical resolution of Figure 4(c) the
value R = 1 is apparently reached, the reﬂection coeﬁcient is always smoller than unity
in ﬁnity peridodic structures.

Figure 5 shows the reﬂection coeﬃcient for the Cantor set pre-fractal potential for
S = 2 (top), S = 3 (middle) and S = 4 (bottom). It is shown that the reﬂection at each
higher stage is a modulated version of that associated with the previous stage. That is,
the reﬂection spectrum exhibits a characteristic fractal proﬁle that reproduces the self-
similarity of the potential distribution. In fact, any wide peak at stage S is transformed
into three narrower and taller peaks at stage S + 1. Zero reﬂection from these fractal
quantum potential occurs at speciﬁc discrete energies, while near total reﬂection is
possible at other discrete energies. Comparing Figures 4 and 5, an increasing number
of zeros inside the band gap is observed. These zeros represent resonances due to the
presence of “defects” in the quasiperiodic potential obtained by removing some segments
in the ﬁnite periodic sequence.

4. Conclusions

The transfer matrix method is becoming the standard method for the calculation of
the tunnelling of quantum particles on constant piecewise potentials because it can
be used for simple, textbook-like problems and as a numerical method for computer
simulations. This procedure has been applied to Cantor set fractal potentials, which are
constant value potentials with support on a Cantor set. For pre-fractals, the S-th stage
fractal, the reﬂection coeﬃcient was numerically calculated and compared with that of

a ﬁnite periodic potential of the same period. The appearance of the ﬁrst band gap
of the Kronig-Penney model in the ﬁnite periodic potential has been illustrated. The
reﬂection coeﬃcient for the Cantor set potential is self-similar.

The transfer matrix method presented in this paper can be easily adopted in
computer laboratories for undergraduate quantum mechanics courses, providing a
powerful method for developing students skill on physics by means of computational
tools. Furthermore, fractal geometry is a highly motivating topic for the students
providing a great opportunity to undertake projects closely related to research ones.

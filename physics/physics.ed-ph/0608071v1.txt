Abstract

Experiments on the oscillatory motion of a suspended bar magnet throws light on the damping

eﬀects acting on the pendulum. The viscous drag oﬀered by air was found the be the main contributor

for slowing the pendulum down. The nature and magnitude of the damping eﬀects were shown to be

strongly dependent on the amplitude.

INTRODUCTION

The simple pendulum is pedagogically a very important experiment. As a result of it’s

simplicity, it is introduced at high school level. The equation of motion (EOM) of a pendulum

undergoing simple harmonic motion (SHM) is given as

d2y
dt2 =

g
L

−

y =

ω2
oy

−

whose solution is easily derivable and can be taught in a class which has been introduced to

calculus. The EOM can be modiﬁed to account for damping as seen in a real pendulum and
yet the equation and it’s solution remains trivial as1

where β = (b/2mL) and ω′ =

β2. However, this approach taken by textbooks over-

simpliﬁes the complex motion of the pendulum and implies that only the pendulum’s amplitude

ω2
o −

q

attenuates with time. On the contrary along with the amplitude even the oscillation’s time
period varies2, a feature overlooked in classroom physics and carried forward for a long time

by students. The diﬃculty in measuring these variations also does not encourage routine

experimentation in high schools/ undergraduate laboratories. However, with the advent of

micro-computers such measurements can now be made easily. Most of the experiments reported
have measured the change in amplitude2,3,4 while examples of measuring variation in time
period is rare5. Since, both amplitude and the time period varies with successive oscillation,
one can expect the pendulum’s velocity to vary with time at a given position. While Gregory1

used knowledge of the oscillation time period to extract information on the pendulum’s velocity,
Avinash Singh et al6 used a novel method to estimate the pendulum’s velocity. A bar magnet

was attached to a rigid semicircular aluminum frame of radius ’L’ which pivoted about the

center of the circle such that the bar magnet oscillates through a coil kept at the mean position.

As the magnet periodically passed through the coil, it generated a series of emf pulses. The
arrangement with proper circuitry determined the peak emf. Avinash et al6 approximated the

2

peak emf (ξmax) as

ξmax ≈  

dφ
dt !max

ωmax

where ωmax is the maximum velocity as the bar magnet passed through the mean position.

This method has it’s advantage when one proposes to study the damping eﬀects in a pendu-
lum. Most of the works studying the variation in oscillation amplitude4,7,8 with time have the

pendulum’s suspension connected to a variable resistance (potentiometer) which introduces

a sliding friction in the pendulum’s motion. Complex mathematics with assumption that all

damping contributors act independently is then used to ﬁlter out information of each con-
tribution. Wang et al9 used a novel but costly method using Doppler eﬀect to monitor the
position of the pendulum to study it’s damping. Thus, Avinash et al6 provides a interesting

yet cheap method to study the damped pendulum. While they rightly pointed out that several

parameters of the experiment such as velocity and strength of the magnet and the number of

turns in the coil can be varied, they did not explicitly discuss them theoretically or study these

factors experimentally. Hence, in this manuscript, we have furthered the study made in ref 6

and have tried to address these issues.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Our pendula was made by suspending a standard bar magnet by a cotton thread. The

tread was fastened to a small hook drilled into one pole of the bar magnet. The length of the

bar magnet (2l) was 7cm and the cotton thread (Ls) used was 53cm long. A coil of 1000 turns

was kept near the pendula’s mean position at a distance ’d’ from the magnet’s lower pole (see

ﬁg 1). The magnetic ﬁeld at point ’A’ is evaluated by

’AC’ and ’BA’ can be written in terms of the pendulum’s

position (angle Θ) using the cosine law. That is,

BA2 = OB2 + OA2

(Ls + 2l).(Ls + 2l + d)cosΘ

Based on the assumption that 2l and d are relatively small compared to Ls, the higher

powers of 2l and d can be neglected. Hence, eqn(2) can be written as

Thus, as the distance between the magnet and detecting coil is increased, the induced emf

decreases. Infact the induced emf is quite weak and is ampliﬁed by an op amp circuit. The

high input impedance of the IC741 opamp ensures that a true measurement of the emf is

made. To digitalise this analog signal (see ﬁg 1, ref 6) using an Analog to Digital Convertor

ADC-0809 (see ﬁg 2a), the ampliﬁed output is rectiﬁed and the peak value is held by charging

a capacitor. The capacitor is discharged via a large resistance so that it retains the peak value

till the next peak value arrives.

We require the ADC to start conversion once the peak value is attained by the capacitor.

This implies a synchronization between the input emf pulses and the ADC’s start of conversion

(SOC) pulses. To achieve this synchronization it is best to generate the required SOC pulse

by wave-shaping the input itself. The ampliﬁed input after rectiﬁcation is fed to a comparator

which compares to +1v. This is to avoid spurious/accidental triggering due to noise. The

inﬁnite gain results in pulses with sharp edges. The width of these pulses are approximately

To/4 (for our pendula
390ms). This would be too large for serving as a SOC and hence
is reduced to a 5µs pulse using a monostable timer made with IC55510. The sequencing

≈

and synchronization can be understood from the various waveforms shown in ﬁg 2b. The

designed circuit digitalises the analog emf and on completion sends an EOC to the computer

or microprocessor kit (in case of a microprocessor this is done through a programmable I/O
IC8155 chip, details of which can be found in the book by Goankar11) which then reads the

eight bit data and stores it for retrivial. This project was done using an 8085 microprocessor

kit. The programme and ﬂowchart used is detailed in the Appendix.

The reliability of our circuit can be tested by measuring the maximum emf induced in

the coil for varying distances ’d’. Eq(4) shows that the measured maximum emf would be

directly proportional to ξo which inturn is inversely proportional to ’d’ (see eqn 5). Fig 3

is evident, the value of (Ls + 4l) as returned by curve ﬁtting eqn(5) on our data is substantially

the graph using eqn(6) was 5o. The emf pulse shown in ﬁg 4 is only for half a cycle starting

from one extreme position to the opposite extreme. As the magnet approaches the coil, the

ﬂux increases and as it crosses the mean position, the emf is negative since the magnet is

receding from the coil. Eventhough the velocity (dΘ/dt) is maximum at the mean position,

since the variation in ﬂux (dφ/dt) is zero, the induced emf is zero as the pendulum passes the

mean position.

B. While undergoing damped oscillation

We have already stated in our introduction that the damped motion described by eqn(1)

exhibits how the pendulum’s oscillation amplitude decreases exponentially with time. The

10

EOM whose solution is given by eqn(1) describes a linear system. The solution can be further

trivialized without losing any generality as

Θ = Θme−

Substituting the above expression in eqn(4) we obtain the relation showing the variation of

induced emf with time. This variation is shown in ﬁg 5. It is also clear from the ﬁgure that
the peaks in the induced emf occurs at ωt = (2n + 1) π

4 . Hence, the angles at which maxima

occur in general is written as

only the positive solutions of eqn(12) would contribute. Using our condition on eqn(11) and

eqn(4) we have

The variation in emf (seen w.r.t time in ﬁg 5) when viewed w.r.t oscillating angle Θ shows

how the peak position decreases (eq 12) as also the amplitude of the maximum induced emf

decreases (eqn 14) with each half cycle. Eqn(9) and eqn(14) shows that the maximum emf

induced for damped pendulums undergoing SHM is directly proportional to the square of

maximum angular displacement given to the pendulum. We have recorded the ﬁrst maxima

This equation describes the motion of a pendulum oscillating in a viscous medium with small

velocity. It would be shown in the next section that the pendulum’s velocity is quite apprecia-
45o and hence it’s motion is not described as in eqn(10), explaining the departure

ble for Θm

for linearity.

IV. RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS

Our prelimary measurements are in good correspondence with commonly known notions

and hence we proceed to investigate further the nature of damping in our pendula. It should

be noted that the amount of damping and it’s nature are strongly pendula dependent and all

results reported here are speciﬁc to our experiment and can not be taken as general. We have

A general expression ae−

bn was ﬁtted to the data of ξmax w.r.t n using a standard and freely

available curve ﬁtting software called ”Curxpt v3.0”. Good ﬁts were obtained for oscillations
set by initial displacements upto 40o. The exponential fall in emf is indicative of the rate of

loss of energy from the oscillating system. It indicates the loss to follow the relation

or

This indicates that the velocity is low and hence the damping/resistive force acting on the
pendulum is proportional to the velocity12. Figure 9 shows the variation of the decay constant

’b’ (of ae−

graph indicates that as Θm increases, the velocity with which the pendulum moves increases

with which the damping constant increases.

FIG. 10: The variation decay in ’b’, a measure of decay in the early oscillations when pendulum was

set in motion with displacements > 45o.

For displacement angles beyond 45o (Θm

45o), eventhough visual examination of the

≥
curves in ﬁg 8 suggests an exponential damping, the data points do not ﬁt to an exponential

fall relation. A detailed examination suggests a more complex process is taking place with
Infact the initial 25-30 data points ﬁt to a/nb. The data

beyond this ﬁt to the exponential fall equation. The a/nb ﬁt corresponds to the damping force
being proportional to higher powers of velocity (vγ, where γ > 1) and in turn the rate of energy

loss also being proportional to higher terms of energy. That is, the rate of energy loss for our
pendulum set into oscillations with a displacement angle > 45o is given as

Figure 10 plots ’b’ versus Θm. The power term (b) is being treated as a measure of damping

and is consistent with the results of ﬁg 9, i.e. as initial displacement increases the damping

becomes large with a proportionality to the pendulum’s velocity.

The resistive force being proportional to higher powers of velcoity has been reported earlier
also3,4,13,14,15,16. A system is reported to have a constant friction (γ = 0) or a linear dependence

of velocity (γ = 1) or a quadratic depenence of velocity (γ = 2). Corresponding to which

the pendulum’s amplitude decays linearly, exponentially and inverse power decay respectively

with time.

It hence maybe concluded that for our pendulum sent into motion by initial

displacements Θ

45o, the damping force is proportional to vγ where γ > 1.

V. CONCLUSION

A simple experiment of setting a suspended bar magnet into oscillations, is a rich source of

information. Not only does it give exposure to Faraday’s induction law and a basic understand-

ing of induced emf’s dependence on angle of oscillation, it enables us to study the damping

eﬀects on the pendulum. This method is better than previously used methods since the mea-

suring technique does not introduce additional contributions to damping. When the oscillation

imparted to the pendulum is very large, the damping eﬀect is also strong with the damping
force being proportional to vγ, where γ > 1 and ’v’ is the pendulum’s velocity. This brings

down the oscillation amplitude of the pendulum and it’s velocity. As the velocity becomes

low, the resistive force acting on the pendulum changes it’s nature and becomes proportional

to ’v’. Considering the rich information obtained from the experiment and the simplicity of

the experiment, it allows the method to be easily implemented as a routine experiment in

undergraduate laboratories.

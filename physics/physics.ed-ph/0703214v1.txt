Abstract

Dirac matrices, also known as gamma matrices, are deﬁned only up to
a similarity transformation. Usually, some explicit representation of these
matrices is assumed in order to deal with them. In this article, we show how
it is possible to proceed without any such assumption. Various important
identities involving Dirac matrices and spinors have been derived without
assuming any representation at any stage.

1 Introduction

In order to obtain a relativistically covariant equation for the quantum mechanical
wave function, Dirac introduced a Hamiltonian that is linear in the momentum
operator. In modern notation, it can be written as

H = γ0

γ · pop + m
(cid:17)

,

(cid:16)

where m is the mass of the particle and pop the momentum operator. We will
throughout use natural units with c = ¯h = 1 so that γ0 and γ are dimensionless.
Because of their anticommutation properties that we mention in § 2, they have to
be matrices. The four matrices are written together as

where we have put a Lorentz index in the left hand side. This should not be made
to mean that the matrices transform as vectors. They are, in fact, constant ma-
trices which are frame-independent. The Lorentz index only implies that the four
quantities obtained by sandwiching these matrices between spinors transform as
components of a contravariant vector. We will also deﬁne the corresponding matri-
ces with lower indices in the usual way:

(1)

(2)

(3)

γµ ≡ {γ0, γi} ,

γµ = gµνγν ,

1

where gµν is the metric tensor, which we take as

gµν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1) .

(4)

When these lower-indexed matrices are sandwiched between spinors, the combina-
tion transforms as a covariant vector.

Some properties of the Dirac matrices follow directly from their deﬁnition in
Eq. (1), as shown in § 2. However, these properties are not enough to specify the
elements of the Dirac matrices. They only deﬁne the matrices up to a similarity
transformation.

Spinors are plane-wave solutions of the wave equation

i

∂ψ
∂t

= Hψ .

(5)

Since H, given in Eq. (1), involves the Dirac matrices which are not uniquely deﬁned,
the solutions also share this non-uniqueness.

In physics, whenever there is an arbitrariness in the deﬁnition of some quantity,
it is considered best to deal with combinations of those quantities which do not
suﬀer from the arbitrariness. For example, components of a vector depend on the
choice of the axes of co-ordinates. Physically meaningful relations can either involve
things like scalar products of vectors which do not depend on the choice of axes,
or are in the form of equality of two quantities (say, two vectors) both of which
transform the same way under a rotation of the axes, so that their equality is not
aﬀected. Needless to say, it is best if we can follow the same principles while dealing
with Dirac matrices and spinors. However, in most texts dealing with them, this
approach is not taken [1]. Most frequently, one chooses an explicit representations
of the Dirac matrices and spinors, and works with them.

Apart from the fact that an explicit representation is aesthetically less satisfying,
it must also be said that dealing with them can also lead to pitfalls. One might use
some relation which holds in some speciﬁc representation but not in general, and
obtain a wrong conclusion.

In this article, we show how useful relations involving Dirac spinors can be ob-
tained without using any explicit representation of the Dirac matrices or spinors.
The article is organized as follows. In § 2, we deﬁne the basic properties of Dirac
matrices and spinors and mention the extent to which their explicit forms are arbi-
trary. In § 3, we recall some well-known deﬁnitions of associated matrices which are
useful in dealing with Dirac matrices. In § 4, we show how spinors can be deﬁned
in a representation-independent fashion and identify their combinations on which
normalization conditions can be imposed. In § 5, we derive some important relations
involving spinors, including their conjugation properties and non-relativistic limits.
In § 6, we discuss important relations coming from conjugation properties of the
spinors. We end with some concluding remarks in § 7.

2 Basic properties of Dirac matrices and spinors

Some properties of the Dirac matrices are immediately derived from Eq. (1). First,
the relativistic Hamiltonian of a free particle is given by

H 2 = p2 + m2 ,

(6)

and Eq. (1), when squared, must yield this relation. Assuming γ0 and γ commute
with the momentum operator, this gives the set of relations

µ = γ0γµγ0 .

The notation δij stands for the Kronecker delta, and an unit matrix is implied in
the right hand side of each relation in Eq. (7). The relations in Eq. (7) can be more
compactly represented as

where gµν is the metric deﬁned in Eq. (4).

Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1) gives some further conditions on the
Dirac matrices, namely that γ0 must be hermitian, and so should be the combina-
tions γ0γi. Both these relations can be summarized by writing

Eqs. (9) and (10) are the basic properties of the Dirac matrices. With these deﬁn-
ing relations, the arbitrariness can be easily seen through the following theorems.

Theorem 1 For any choice of the matrices γµ satisfying Eqs. (9) and (10), if we
take another set deﬁned by

˜γµ = UγµU †

(11)

for some unitary matrix U, then these new matrices satisfy the same anticommuta-
tion and hermiticity properties as the matrices γµ.

The proof of this theorem is straight forward and trivial. It is non-trivial to prove
the converse:

3

Theorem 2 If two sets of matrices γµ and ˜γµ both satisfy Eqs. (9) and (10), they
are related through Eq. (11) for some unitary matrix U.

Thus, Dirac matrices are deﬁned only up to a similarity transformation with a
unitary matrix.

To obtain the deﬁning equation for the spinors, we multiply both sides of Eq.

(5) by γ0 and put pop = −i∇ into the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1). This gives

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

There are two types of plane-wave solutions:

where

Ep being the positive energy eigenvalue:

iγµ∂µψ − mψ = 0 .

ψ ∼

u((p))e−ip·x ,
v((p))e+ip·x ,

(

pµ ≡ {Ep, p} ,

Ep = +

p2 + m2 .

q

In Eq. (13) and later, we indicate functional dependence in double parentheses so
that it does not get confused with multiplicative factors in parentheses.

Putting Eq. (13) into Eq. (12), we obtain the equations that deﬁne the u and

v-spinors:

(γµpµ − m)u((p)) = 0 ,
(γµpµ + m)v((p)) = 0 .

Obviously, the spinors are arbitrary in the sense that if we change γµ to ˜γµ through
the prescription given in Eq. (11) and also change the spinors to

˜u((p)) = Uu((p)) ,

˜v((p)) = Uv((p)) ,

Eqs. (16) and (17) are satisﬁed by the new matrices and the new spinors. Eq.
(18) shows the arbitrarines in the deﬁnition of the spinors, because of which the
spinors themselves are representation-dependent.
In spite of this, a remarkable
number of relations about the spinors can be proved without taking recourse of any
representation, as we show in the later parts of this article.

3 Some associated matrices

To begin with, we deﬁne some matrices associated with the Dirac matrices. These
deﬁnitions can be obtained in any textbook dealing with Dirac ﬁelds, but are com-
piled here for the sake of completeness.

4

The sigma-matrices are deﬁned as

The next important matrix is deﬁned from the observation that the matrices −γ⊤
µ
satisfy the same anticommutation and hermiticity properties as γµ. By Theorem 2,
there must then exist a unitary matrix C such that

Note that the two deﬁnitions imply the relation

Another important matrix is γ5, deﬁned as

From Eq. (9), it is easily seen that

It is also easy to see that γ5 anticommutes with all γµ’s and commutes with all σµν’s:

To show why these matrices are useful, we prove one important result that can

be found in all textbooks. Using Eq. (23), we can write

4 The spinors

4.1 Eigenvectors of γ0

Consider the matrix γ0. It is a 4 × 4 matrix, so it has four eigenvalues and eigen-
vectors. It is hermitian, so the eigenvalues are real. In fact, from Eq. (9) we know
that its square is the unit matrix, so that its eigenvalues can only be ±1. Since γ0
is traceless, as we have just proved, there must be two eigenvectors with eigenvalue
+1 and two with −1:

γ0ξs = ξs ,

γ0χs = −χs .

The subscripts on ξ and χ distinguishes two diﬀerent eigenvectors of each kind. Of
course this guarantees that

since they belong to diﬀerent eigenvalues. But since the two ξ’s are degenerate and
so are the two χ’s, there is some arbitrariness in deﬁning them even for a given form
of the matrix γ0. In order to remove the arbitrariness, let us note that the matrices
σij, with both space indices, commute with γ0. In particular, say,

i
Thus, we can choose the eigenstates of γ0 such that they are simultaneously eigen-
states of σ12. From Eqs. (9) and (19), it is easy to see that

ξ†
sχs′ = 0 ,

= 0 .

σ12, γ0
h

2

= 1 ,

σ12
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

so that the eigenvalues of σ12 are ±1 as well. Therefore, let us choose the eigenvectors
of γ0 such that

σ12ξs = sξs ,

σ12χs = sχs ,

with s = ±. Once we ﬁx the spinors in this manner, the four eigenvectors are
mutually orthogonal, i.e., in addition to Eq. (30), the following relations also hold:

One might wonder, why are we spending so much time in discussing the eigen-
vectors of γ0? To see the reason, let us consider Eq. (16) for vanishing 3-momentum.
In this case Ep = m, so that Eq. (16) simply reduces to

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

ξ†
sξs′ = δss′ ,
χ†
sχs′ = δss′ .

(γ0 − 1)u((0)) = 0 ,

6

whereas Eq. (17) reduces to

(γ0 + 1)v((0)) = 0 .

This shows that, at zero momentum, the u-spinors and the v-spinors are sim-
ply eigenstates of γ0 with eigenvalues +1 and −1. Thus we can deﬁne the zero-
momentum spinors as

us((0)) ∝ ξs ,

vs((0)) ∝ χ−s ,

apart from possible normalizing factors which will be speciﬁed later.

4.2 Spinors and their normalization

We now want to ﬁnd the spinors for any value of p. We know that these will
have to satisfy Eqs. (16) and (17), and, for p → 0, these should reduce to the
zero-momentum solutions shown above. With these observations, we propose the
following solutions:

us((p)) = Np(γµpµ + m)ξs ,
vs((p)) = Np(−γµpµ + m)χ−s ,

where Np is a normalizing factor. One might wonder why we have put χ−s and not
χs in the deﬁnition of vs. It is nothing more than a convention. It turns out that
when we do quantum ﬁeld theory, this convention leads to an easy interpretation of
the subscript s. This issue will not be discussed here.

It is easy to see that our choices for the spinors satisfy Eqs. (16) and (17) since

(γµpµ − m)(γνpν + m) = p2 − m2 = 0 .

(41)

It is also easy to see that in the zero-momentum limit, these solutions reduce to the
eigenvalues of γ0, apart from a normalizing factor. For example, putting p = 0 and
Ep = m into Eq. (39), we obtain

us((0)) = N0m(γ0 + 1)ξs = 2mN0ξs .

(42)

In order to determine a convenient normalization of the spinors, let us rewrite

Eq. (39) more explicitly:

us((p)) = Np(γ0Ep − γipi + m)ξs = Np(Ep + m − γipi)ξs ,

(43)

using Eq. (29) in the last step. Similarly, we obtain

vs((p)) = Np(Ep + m + γipi)χ−s .

Recalling that γi’s are anti-hermitian matrices, we then obtain

(37)

s((p)) = N ∗

u†
s((p))us′((p)) = 2Epδss′ .

v†
s((p))vs′((p)) = 2Epδss′ .

and using Eq. (35), we obtain the normalization conditions in the form

Through a similar procedure, one can obtain a similar condition on the v-spinors:

We now need a relation that expresses the orthogonality between an u-spinor and
a v-spinor. In obtaining Eqs. (51) and (52), the linear terms in γipi, appearing in
Eqs. (43) and (45) or in the similar set of equations involving the v-spinors, cancel.
The same will not work in combinations of the form u†
s((p))vs′((p)) because the γipi
terms have the same sign in both factors. However we notice that if we reverse the
3-momentum in one of the factors, these problematic terms cancel. We can then
follow the same steps, more or less, and use Eq. (30) to obtain

s((−p))vs′((p)) = v†
u†

s((−p))us′((p)) = 0 .

(53)

It should be noted that the normalization relations of Eqs. (51) and (52) can be
written in an alternative form by using the Gordon identity. In a general form, this
identity reads

1
2m

¯us′((p′))

¯us′((p′))γλus((p)) =

(p + p′)λ − iσλρqρ
h
We do not give the proof of this identity because it is proved in a representation-
independent manner in all textbooks. Putting p = p′ and taking only the time
component of the equation, we obtain the relation

us((p)) .
i

(54)

2m u†

s′((p′))us((p)) = 2Ep¯us′((p′))us((p)) ,

(55)

8

so that Eq. (51) implies

¯us((p))us′((p)) = 2mδss′ .

Unless m = 0, this can be taken as the normalization condition for the u-spinors.
Similarly, Eq. (52) gives

¯vs((p))vs′((p)) = −2mδss′ ,

which is an alternative normalization condition unless the fermion is massless.

The analog of Eq. (53), with bars rather than daggers, can be derived directly
from the equations deﬁning the spinors. Multiplying Eq. (16) from the left by ¯vs′((p))
we obtain

¯vs′((p))(γµpµ − m)us((p)) = 0 .

Multiplying the hermitian conjugate of the equation for vs′((p)) by us((p)) from the
right, we get

¯vs′((p))(γµpµ + m)us((p)) = 0 .

Subtracting one of these equations from another, we ﬁnd that

unless the particle is massless. Similarly, we also get

¯vs′((p))us((p)) = 0

¯us′((p))vs((p)) = 0 .

4.3 Spin sums

The spinors also satisfy some completeness relations, which can be proved without
invoking their explicit forms. Consider the sum

Au((p)) ≡

us((p))¯us((p)) .

s
X

Note that, using Eq. (56), we get

Au((p))us′((p)) =

us((p))

¯us((p))us′((p))
h
= 2mus′((p)) .

s
X

i

And, using Eq. (61), we get

Recalling Eqs. (16) and (17), it is obvious that on the spinors us((p)) and vs((p)),
the operation of Au((p)) produces the same result as the operation of γµpµ +m. Since

Au((p))vs′((p)) = 0 .

any 4-component column vector can be written as a linear superposition of the basis
spinors us((p)) and vs((p)), it means that the action of Au((p)) and of γµpµ + m
produces identical results on any 4-component column vector. The two matrices
must therefore be the same:

Similar resoning gives

us((p))¯us((p)) = γµpµ + m .

vs((p))¯vs((p)) = −γµpµ + m .

5 Relations involving spinors

We now show some non-trivial properties of the spinors. In all textbooks, they are
deduced in the Dirac-Pauli representation of the γ-matrices. Using Eq. (11), one can
show that if they hold in one representation, they must hold in other representations
as well. Here we derive them without using any representation at any stage of the
proofs.

5.1 Action of γ0 on spinors

We ﬁrst consider the eﬀect of γ0 acting on the spinors. From Eq. (43), we ﬁnd

γ0us((p)) = Npγ0(Ep + m − γipi)ξs

= Np(Ep + m + γipi)γ0ξs = Np(Ep + m + γipi)ξs ,

(67)

using the anticommutation relations and Eq. (29). This shows that

Following the same procedure, we can obtain the result

γ0us((p)) = us((−p)) .

γ0vs((p)) = −vs((−p)) .

Eqs. (68) and (69) are very important relations for deducing properties of fermions
under parity. These relations can be used to deduce Eqs. (60) and (61) from Eq.
(53), or vice versa.

5.2 Conjugation relations

Let us now deduce another set of relations, which play an important role in deriving
charge conjugation properties of fermions. To build up to these relations, let us ﬁrst
consider the object

λs = γ0Cξ∗
s ,

10

(65)

(66)

(68)

(69)

(70)

where the matrix C was deﬁned in Eq. (20). To ﬁnd out about the nature of λs, we
ﬁrst consider the action of γ0 on it:

γ0λs = γ0γ0Cξ∗

s = −γ0Cγ⊤

0 ξ∗
s ,

using Eq. (20) again. However, the complex conjugate of Eq. (29) implies that

since

0 ξ∗
γ⊤

s = ξ∗
s ,

0 = γ⊤
γ∗
0

because of the hermiticity of the matrix γ0. Putting this in, we obtain

γ0λs = −γ0Cξ∗

s = −λs ,

showing that λs is an eigenvector of γ0 with eigenvalue −1. Therefore, it must be a
combination of the χs’s.

To determine which combination of the χs’s occur in λs, we use Eq. (21) and

recall that σ12 commutes with γ0 to obtain

σ12λs = γ0σ12Cξ∗

s = −γ0Cσ⊤

12ξ∗
s .

It can be easily seen from Eqs. (10) and (19) that σ12 is hermitian. So, from Eq.
(33), we obtain

which gives

12ξ∗
σ⊤

s =

σ12ξs

= sξ∗
s ,

∗

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

σ12λs = −sγ0Cξ∗

s = −sλs .

This shows that λs is also an eigenstate of σ12, with eigenvalue −s. Recalling the
result we found earlier about its eigenvalue of γ0, we conclude that λs must be
proportional to χ−s. Since both γ0 and C are unitary matrices and ξs is normalized
to have unit norm, the norm of λs is also unity, so the proportionality constant can
be a pure phase, of the form eiθ. But notice that the deﬁnition of the matrix C in
Eq. (20) has a phase arbitariness as well. In other words, given a set of matrices γµ,
the matrix C can be obtained only up to an overall phase from Eq. (20). We can
utilize this arbitrariness by ﬁxing λs to be equal to χ−s, i.e.,

(71)

(72)

(73)

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

(78)

(79)

Similarly one obtains

γ0Cξ∗

s = χ−s .

γ0Cχ∗

s = ξ−s .

11

To see the implication of these relations between the eigenvectors of γ0, we take
the complex conjugate of Eq. (43). Remembering that the matrices γi are anti-
hermititan so that γ∗

i , we obtain

i = −γ⊤

u∗
s((p)) = Np(Ep + m + γ⊤

i pi)ξ∗

s = Np(Ep + m − C −1γiCpi)ξ∗
s ,

(80)

using the deﬁnition of the matrix C from Eq. (20). Multiplying from the left by
γ0C, we obtain

γ0Cu∗

s((p)) = Np

(Ep + m)γ0Cξ∗

s − γ0γiCpiξ∗
s

.

(81)

Since γ0 anticommutes with γi, this can be written as

h

i

γ0Cu∗

s((p)) = Np

(Ep + m) + γipi
h

γ0Cξ∗
i

s = Np

(Ep + m) + γipi
h

χ−s .
i

(82)

Using Eq. (44), we now obtain

This is an important relation. Following similar steps, we can also prove the relation

γ0Cu∗

s((p)) = vs((p)) .

γ0Cv∗

s ((p)) = us((p)) .

(83)

(84)

5.3 Non-relativistic reduction

In ﬁeld-theoretical manipulations, sometimes we encounter expressions which can be
interpreted easily by making a non-relativistic reduction. For example, in Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED), the matrix element of the electromagnetic current operator
between two single-particle states can be written from general principles as

hp′, s′ |jλ((0))| p, si =

e

2EpV
q
q
×¯us′((p′))

2Ep′V
F1((q2))γλ + F2((q2))σλρqρ

us((p)) ,

(85)

h
where e is the unit of charge which is usually taken to be the proton charge, |p, si
and |p′, s′i represent the initial and ﬁnal fermion states whose norms are normalized
to unity within a volume V ,

i

q = p − p′ ,

(86)

and F1 and F2 denote two form factors. To understand the physical interpretation
of these form factors, it is useful to look at the matrix element of Eq. (85) in the
non-relativistic limit.

Since the momenta are much smaller compared to the mass in the non-relativistic
limit, we use the zero-momentum solutions for the spinors. In this limit, the combi-
nation of Dirac matrices and spinors appearing in the ﬁrst term of Eq. (85) can be
written as

¯us′((p′))γλus((p)) NR−→ 2m ξ†

s′γλξs .

(87)

12

Consider the spatial part ﬁrst. Note that, using the deﬁnition of ξs from Eq. (29)
and the fact that γ0 anticommutes with all γi, we can write

s′γiξs = ξ†
ξ†

s′γ0γiξs = −ξ†

s′γiγ0ξs = −ξ†

s′γiξs ,

so that

As for the temporal part of the matrix element, we simply obtain

ξ†
s′γiξs = 0 .

s′γ0ξs = ξ†
ξ†

s′ξs = δss′ .

Thus, in the coupling of this current with the photon ﬁeld, only the coupling to A0
remains in this approximation, and it is non-zero only when the initial and ﬁnal
states have the same spin. For s = s′. the factor multiplying A0 is eF1/V , which
can be interpreted as the charge density. For this reason, F1(q2) is called the charge
form factor.

We next look at the second kind of combination that appears in Eq. (85). Again,

¯us′((p′))σλρus((p)) NR−→ 2m ξ†

s′σλρξs .

In the eﬀective Lagrangian density in the co-ordinate space, this gives a term of the
form

With the help of Eqs. (29) and (89), it is easy to show that

So couplings of the form shown in Eq. (92) exist only for the components F ij, i.e.,
to the magnetic ﬁeld strength. The spin operator Σ can be deﬁned by

with ǫ123 = −ǫ123 = +1. Then the interaction in Eq. (92) can be rewritten as

The matrix element of the spin operator Σ can be shown to be an expectation

the matrix element is the expectation value of Σz if s = s′, and is zero otherwise.
Putting the expectation value, we can write the expression of Eq. (96) for s = s′ as

Since 1
2s is the eigenvalue of the spin operator, and the magnetic moment µ is deﬁned
by the interaction −µΣ · B, we ﬁnd that this term implies a contribution to the
magnetic moment of magnitude

µA = −2eF2((0)) .

(98)

As is well-known, this contribution is called the anomalous magnetic moment.
A direct moment comes from the charge form factor, which can be seen by using
the Gordon identity.

6 The conjugation matrix C

As a bi-product of the discussion about the spinors, we show here some interesting
properties relating to the matrix C. It can be called the conjugation matrix because
it appears in the conjugation properties of the spinors, as shown in Eqs. (83) and
(84).

6.1 Antisymmetry of C

We ﬁrst show that the conjugation properties of the spinors imply an important
characteristic of the matrix C. Taking the expression for vs((p)) from Eq. (83) and
putting it into Eq. (84), we obtain

Using Eqs. (73) and (20), this can be written as

γ0Cγ∗

0C ∗us((p)) = us((p)) .

− CC ∗us((p)) = us((p)) .

Thus, both u-spinors are eigenvectors of the matrix −CC ∗, with eigenvalue +1.
Similarly, substituting the expression for the u-spinor from Eq. (84) into Eq. (83), we
obtain that both v-spinors are also eigenvectors of the matrix −CC ∗, with eigenvalue
+1. Any column vector can be expressed as a linear superposition of the u and v
spinors, so any column vector is an eigenvector of the matrix −CC ∗, with eigenvalue
+1. This can happen only if −CC ∗ is the unit matrix, i.e., if

Using the unitarity of the matrix C, this relation can also be written as

(99)

(100)

(101)

(102)

i.e., C must be an antisymmetric matrix in any representation of the Dirac matrices.

C ∗ = −C −1 .

C ⊤ = −C ,

6.2 Alternative deﬁnition of spinors

It might seem a little bit unsatisfactory in the ﬁrst sight that we had to choose
the phase of the matrix C in order to arrive at the conjugation relations between
spinors. We can take an alternative route, if desired. We deﬁne the u-spinors as
solutions of Eq. (16) and the matrix C through Eq. (20), just as before. Irrespective
of the phase choices made in either deﬁnition, we then deﬁne the v-spinors through
Eq. (83).

None of the conclusions arrived at earlier is disturbed by this choice. This is
because one can use Eqs. (9) and (20) and the hermiticity properties of the Dirac
matrices to show that

(γµpµ + m)v((p)) = (γµpµ + m)γ0Cu∗

s((p))

= −γ0C

(γµpµ − m)us((p))

.

(103)

Since the last factor vansihed because of Eq. (16), the v-spinors satisfy Eq. (17).

7 Concluding remarks

The aim of the article was to show that some important identities involving Dirac
spinors can be proved without invoking any speciﬁc form for the spinors. As we
mentioned earlier, the speciﬁc forms depend on the representation of the Dirac
matrices. For the sake of elegance and safety, it is better to deal with the spinors in
a representation-independent manner.

The analysis can be extended to quantum ﬁeld theory involving Dirac ﬁelds.
Properties of Dirac ﬁeld under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal can be
derived in completely representation-independent manner. This has been done at
least in one textbook of quantum ﬁeld theory [2], to which we refer for the details.

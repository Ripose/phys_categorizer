The asymptotic form of the plane-wave decomposition into spherical waves, which is often used,
in particular, to express the scattering amplitude through the phase shifts, is incorrect. We precisely
explain why it is incorrect and show how to circumvent mathematical inconsistency.

In quantum mechanics one uses the following plane-wave decomposition into the spherical waves

eikr

=

il(2l + 1) Pl(cosΘ) jl(kr) ,

∞

Xl=0

where kr = kr cosΘ, Pl is the l−th Legendre polynomial and jl is the l−th spherical Bessel function. Since in the
scattering theory we are interested in the large distance behavior of the wave function, one uses the asymptotic form
of the spherical function

and rewrites Eq. (1) as

jl(kr) ≈ sin(kr − πl/2)

,

kr

≈ 1
kr

Xl=0

il(2l + 1) Pl(cosΘ) sin(kr − πl/2) .

(3)

Eq. (3) is written down in numerous handbooks of quantum mechanics, including the most famous by Schiﬀ [1] and
by Landau and Lifshitz [2]. Astonishingly, the formula (3) is meaningless and for this reason we put the question
mark over the approximate equality. The series is not only divergent but it cannot cannot be even treated as an
asymptotic expansion of the function eikr at large distnaces.

To see how badly the series (3) diverges we consider the special case cosΘ = 1. Then, Pl(1) = 1 and after simple

calculation we get

(2l + 1) cos2(πl/2) − i

(2l + 1) sin2(πl/2)

According to Eq. (4) both the real and imaginary parts of eikr equal the divergent series, independently how large is

In physics we, however, often deal with the so-called asymptotic series which can be divergent but still correctly
represent certain functions. As known, see e.g. [3], the inﬁnite series a0(x) + a1(x) + a2(x) + . . . is the asymptotic
expansion of the function f (x) at x0 (which can be inﬁnite) if

Equivalently, the series is asymptotic if

1
an(x) (cid:16)

n

Xl=0

(cid:17)

f (x) −

al(x)

→ 0 for x → x0 .

al+1(x)
al(x)

→ 0 for x → x0 .

Due to the deﬁnition (5) any ﬁnite sub-series of the asymptotic series approximates the function f (x) and the
approximation is getting better and better as x → x0. However, the series (3) does not satisfy the condition (6), and
consequently, it cannot be treated as an asymptotic expansion of eikr at large distances.

What is wrong with the expansion (3)? It appears that the approximate formula (2) requires

For completeness, we derive this condition here, ﬁnding not only the ﬁrst but also the second term of the 1/z expansion
of jl(z). It is well known, see e.g. [4], that the spherical Bessel functions are expressed by the elementary functions as

kr ≫ 1

l(l + 1) .

jl(z) = zl

(cid:18)

jl+1(z) = −zl d

(cid:19)

,

dz (cid:18)

Using Eq. (8) and the recurant formula

one asilly proves by induction that

jl(z) =

sin(z − πl/2)
z

l(l + 1)

cos(z − πl/2)

+ O(

z3 ) .

Comparing the two terms of the expansion (9), one ﬁnds that the approximation (2) holds if the condition (7) is
satisﬁed. When one performs the summation in Eq. (3), the terms of suﬃciently large l violate the requirement (7),
and eﬀectively destroy even the approximate equality.

Although the decomposition (3) is incorrect the results obtained by means of it are usually correct. Obviously, the
famous formula, which expresses the scattering amplitude via the phase shifts, is correct. However, it is of interest to
see why the derivation works. Therefore, we ﬁrst discuss the standard procedure, which can be found, for example,
in [1,2], and then we show how to avoid the mathematical inconsistency.

Assuming that the azimuthal symmetry, one writes the scattering wave function as

φk(r) =

Al il(2l + 1) Pl(cosΘ) Rl(r) ,

∞

Xl=0

where Rl are the radial wave functions and Al are the coeﬃcients to be determined. Assuming that the asymptotics
of the radial function is

where δl denotes the l−th phase-shift, one rewrites Eq. (10) as

Rl(r) ≈ sin(kr − πl/2 + δl)

,

kr

φk(r)

?

≈ 1
kr

∞

Xl=0

Al il(2l + 1) Pl(cosΘ) sin(kr − πl/2 + δl) .

We still put the question mark over the equalities which are mathematically inappropriate.

And now, one compares the wave function (12) with the expected asymptotic form of the scattering wave function

φk(r) = eikr

+ f (Θ)

,

where f (Θ) is the scattering amplitude. Using the plane-wave decomposition (3), one ﬁnds the equation

Al il(2l + 1) Pl(cosΘ) sin(kr − πl/2 + δl)

il(2l + 1) Pl(cosΘ) sin(kr − πl/2) + f (Θ)

Xl=0

Equating the terms proportional to e−ikr, one ﬁnds that Al = eiδl which substituted into the terms proportional to
eikr provide the famous result

As seen, we have got the relation (15) using the mathematically meaningless equations Eqs. (3,12,14). Next, we show
how to derive Eq. (15) avoiding the inconsistency.

As previously we start with the wave function of the form (10), and we use the asymptotics of the radial wave

function (11) but only for ﬁx values of l. For this reason we compute the projection

f (Θ) =

f (Θ) =

Cl il (2l + 1) Pl(cosΘ) ,

where we have taken into account that the Legendre polynomials are orthogonal

We decompose the scattering amplitude

and we project the scattering wave function (13) as

d(cosΘ)

eikr

+ f (Θ)

Pl(cosΘ) = 2 il

jl(kr) + Cl

(cid:16)

eikr
r (cid:17)

.

Now, we equate the asymptotic forms of the projections (16,18), and thus, instead of Eq. (14) we get

Al sin(kr − πl/2 + δl) = sin(kr − πl/2) + Clk

eikr
r

.

Comparing the terms proportional to e−ikr and eikr, respectively, one ﬁnds that Al = eiδl and then

Cl =

1
2ik

e−iπl/2

e2iδl − 1
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

,

which, due to the formula (17), again provides the the result (15).

Although the problem discussed here looks rather academic it was discovered in the course of concrete calculations.
To simplify the computation of a correlation function where the scattering wave function enters, we have used the form
(12) with Al = eiδl which is repeatedly written in numerous handbooks. We have been interested in the complete sum
of partial waves and we have used Eq. (12) instead of Eq. (13) to exploit the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials.
Needless to say that the whole computation has gone wrong, showing that the asymptotic expressions must be treated
very carefully.

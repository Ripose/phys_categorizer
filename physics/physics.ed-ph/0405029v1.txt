Abstract

Deformation quantization (sometimes called phase-space quantization)
is a formulation of quantum mechanics that is not usually taught to un-
dergraduates. It is formally quite similar to classical mechanics: ordinary
functions on phase space take the place of operators, but the functions
are multiplied in an exotic way, using the ⋆-product. Here we attempt a
brief, pedagogical discussion of deformation quantization, that is suitable
for inclusion in an undergraduate course.

1 Introduction

Another way of doing quantum mechanics grew from pioneering works of Weyl,
Wigner, Groenewold, Moyal, Baker, and others. For reviews, see [1]. Its im-
portance as an autonomous formulation of quantum mechanics was appreciated
in the 1970s; it was also understood that it could be viewed as a deformation
of classical mechanics [2]. The formulation was therefore dubbed deformation
quantization.

The pedagogical review article [3] advocated that deformation quantization

1

be included in graduate studies, and it is treated in some graduate textbooks
(see [4], for example). We believe undergraduate students would also beneﬁt by
learning something about deformation quantization, i.e. from an exposure to it.
For that reason, we attempt here a brief, pedagogical discussion of deformation
quantization, with upper-level undergraduates and their instructors in mind.

To make our presentation as pedagogical as possible, we will restrict to the
case of one degree of freedom, i.e., to the case of a single particle moving on the
x-axis. We’ll only treat pure quantum states, since the generalization to mixed
states is straightforward. Lastly, although the Weyl ordering and correspond-
ing Groenewold-Moyal ⋆-product determine just one of many diﬀerent ways to
do deformation quantization, we will only discuss the Weyl-Groenewold-Moyal
case.

It is important to point out, however, that deformation quantization is not
just of pedagogical interest. Recently, it has been an active research topic
in both physics and mathematics. Physicists studying string theory use the
methods of deformation quantization because in certain conditions, strings live
in spaces whose coordinates do not commute [5, 6], much as the two quantum
coordinates X, P of phase-space do not, according to (8). The mathematician
Kontsevich’s work on deformation quantization in [7] was part of the reason he
was awarded the Fields medal, math’s highest honor.

2 Overview

Consider a single particle, with position x and momentum p. Phase space is
the two-dimensional space with coordinates (x, p). Each point of phase space
speciﬁes a classical state of the system, and as a state evolves in time, a point
traces out a path in phase space. For example, a simple harmonic oscillator
follows an elliptical trajectory, centered on the origin (x, p) = (0, 0).

If our knowledge of a system were imprecise, the state might be given as a
probability distribution on phase space, perhaps a bump with its center at the
most probable values (¯x, ¯p). Classical dynamics could be done by following the
evolution of this distribution.

Can quantum mechanics be done in a similar way? The answer is yes, and

the way is called deformation quantization [1, 2].

By doing quantum mechanics this way, the introduction of abstract quantum
states, and their Hilbert spaces, can be avoided. States are described instead
by functions on phase space, as in classical mechanics. As a consequence, the

2

relation between quantum and classical mechanics may be understood better.

Before sketching how deformation quantization is done, we need to empha-
size that quantization of a classical system is not a unique procedure, no matter
what formulation of quantum mechanics is used. In the operator approach, x
and p are replaced by the corresponding operators, denoted X and P . Sup-
pose we need to work with something like x2p in quantum mechanics, should
we consider X 2P ? Or XP X, for example? The ambiguity can be reduced
by demanding that the operators constructed be Hermitian, but that does not
eliminate the choice completely.

This operator-ordering ambiguity is not a new problem, special to deforma-
tion quantization, since it is part of the usual operator approach to quantum
mechanics. A choice must be made, so let’s use the so-called Weyl ordering,
and write

ϑ(x2p) =

(X 2P + XP X + P X 2) .

(1)

1
3

Weyl ordering can be extended to functions on phase space by specifying how it
works on all monomials xmpn, and then applying it to the Taylor expansions of
functions. ϑ(xmpn) is simply the average of all possible orderings of m factors
of X and n factors of P .

ϑ is known as the Weyl map, taking functions on phase space to operators.
We now have an operator ϑ(f ) that corresponds to a function f = f (x, p) on
phase space. We’ll call such an operator a Weyl operator. Multiplying two Weyl
operators gives another one, so their algebra closes, as it must.

Remarkably, one can prove a stronger statement. It is this result that makes

deformation quantization possible. Groenewold showed that

ϑ(f ) ϑ(g) = ϑ(f ⋆ g) .

(2)

That is, multiplying two Weyl operators is equivalent to ⋆-multiplying the cor-
responding phase-space functions, and then applying ϑ. The ⋆-product (pro-
nounced star-product) takes the form

f (x, p) ⋆ g(x, p)

Since it is directly related to the product of Weyl operators, the ⋆-product is
non-commutative and associative, as the product of operators is. It is a strange-
looking product precisely because it must mimic the product of operators.

Eqn. (2) is important because it suggests that one might be able to avoid
constructing operators from functions on phase space and just work with the
functions directly, as long as they are multiplied using the ⋆-product. This
is exactly what is done in deformation quantization. Operator products are
changed to ⋆-products, and the Weyl map ϑ is factored oﬀ, roughly speaking.

To give the ﬂavor of how it goes, it is easy to show from (3) that

[X, P ] = i¯h .

This result is consistent with the crucial canonical commutation relation

To do quantum mechanics we need further ingredients, beyond the ⋆-product.
The quantum state must be described. In the operator formulation, a pure quan-
tum state is describable by a state vector
. The most general type of quantum
i
state is a mixed state, however, and it incorporates classical probabilities for dif-
ferent pure states. It is a mixed quantum state that corresponds to the classical
distribution on phase space mentioned in the second paragraph. To specify such
a mixed state, the density matrix (sometimes called the state operator) ˆρ must
be used (see [8] for a nice discussion).

We’ll nevertheless restrict this discussion to the case of a pure state ψ, since

it makes the presentation easier to follow. Then

Generalization to mixed states is straightforward.

Now we have an operator, and to do deformation quantization, we need a
function on phase space that corresponds to it in the manner of (2). That is,
we need an operation

This hints at a punchline: deformation quantization is the Weyl transform

of quantum mechanics done with the density matrix, or state operator.

3 Weyl Transform and Groenewold-Moyal Star

Product

In this section, some detail and proofs omitted in the previous section will be
provided. It can be skipped in a ﬁrst reading.

First, consider the Weyl map of functions on phase space, like f (x, p). By

expanding, it is not hard to convince oneself that

ϑ ((ax + bp)n) = (aX + bP )n ,

for all parameters a, b. It follows that

ϑ(eax+bp) = eaX+bP ,

using (4). Now, the Taylor series of f (x, p) about (x, p) = (0, 0) can be written
as

This combined with (15) gives

f (∂a, ∂b) eax+bp

a,b=0 = f (x, p) .

Another formula that one sees quite often is

ϑ(f ) =

dτ dσ dx dp f (x, p)eiτ (P −p)+iσ(X−x) .

(19)

1
(2π)2 Z

It follows from (15) and Fourier methods. The usual Fourier expression is

(20)

(21)

f (x, p) =

dτ dσ ˜f (τ, σ)eiσx+iτ p ,

Z

where

˜f (τ, σ) =

−iσx

is the Fourier transform of f (x, p). According to (15), the Weyl map ϑ simply
replaces eiσx+iτ p with eiσX+iτ P . Making that replacement in (20, 21) gives (19).

Equations (17, 18, 19) are not so useful for calculating simple examples. They
are, however, important for discussing the general properties of Weyl maps. For
example, the ⋆-product is introduced because of the crucial property (2). In
order to prove it, (18) can be used. First,

ϑ(f )ϑ(g) = f (a, b) e

eA eB = e

2 [A,B] eA+B ,

(23)

valid when the commutator [A, B] commutes with both A and B. Eqn. (22)
becomes

i¯h
2 (

The result (2) then follows.

As mentioned above, the Groenewold-Moyal ⋆-product, deﬁned in (3), is

non-commutative, i.e. f ⋆ g

= g ⋆ f . It is, however, associative

(f1 ⋆ f2) ⋆ f3 = f1 ⋆ (f2 ⋆ f3) .

larly, it is easy to show that

The exponent of the ⋆-product (3) indicates the most important property of
deformation quantization: its intimate relation to classical physics. In classical
mechanics, it is the Poisson bracket of functions on phase space,

that enters the dynamical equations [9]. In the operator formulation of quantum
mechanics, it is the commutator [F, G] of operator observables F and G that is
important. In deformation quantization, the ⋆-commutator

Now let us consider the Weyl transform

(G) of an operator G, deﬁned
by the property (10), and given explicitly by the formula (11). Of course, here
G = G(X, P ) is an operator function of the operators X and P .

W

First, let us argue for the formula (11). From the development preceding

(17), it is clear that we only need to show

(eaX+bP ) = eax+bp ,

i.e., the inverse of (15). This is not diﬃcult, however, using the Baker-Campbell-

Because of (10), it works if the operators are Weyl operators, i.e., if G = ϑ(g)

4 Wigner Function

Now that the basics have been established, we can consider the description of
quantum states and their evolution. As stated above, the central object is the
Wigner function (12).

In the operator method, one must determine the description of a state. Its
state vector
, the description, is found by solving the Schr¨odinger equation

Thus the Hamiltonian and Wigner function ⋆-commute. A stronger relation

5 Example: Simple Harmonic Oscillator

The most common non-trivial example studied in physics, quantum or classical,
is the simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). We will now treat the quantum SHO
using deformation quantization, following [10]. Our results will illustrate some
of the properties of the Wigner function in deformation quantization.

Recall from above that H ⋆ ρ = Eρ. Taking ω = m = 1 for simplicity, the

SHO Hamiltonian is ˆH = 1

phase space passing through the origin.

The classical SHO with this symmetry follows a circular trajectory in phase
space, centered on the origin. The naive expectation might be then that the
Wigner function, describing the corresponding quantum state, is a spread-out
version of this; a single, circular ridge located above the corresponding classical
phase path. The Figures show that only part of the Wigner function looks
like that. There are oscillations in ρ, and it even goes into negative values.
This means it is not a true probability distribution; it is instead called a quasi-
probability distribution.

This feature partly explains why deformation quantization is less popular
than other formalisms of quantum mechanics. We stress again, however, that
it reproduces all the predictions of the more familiar operator methods. For
(x) against x (it could also be
instance, Figure 3 plots the probability density
(x) against p, because of symmetry), found using (38). The curve is identical

to that found from the state vector solving Schrodinger’s equation. It is also true
that expectation values of operators, such as X mP n, calculated using (40), agree
perfectly with those calculated in the more familiar formulations of quantum
mechanics.

6 Conclusion

Deformation quantization is another way to do quantum mechanics. It has some
strange features, such as a quasi-probability distribution, and an exotic way of
multiplying functions, the ⋆-product. But it is perfectly consistent, and its pre-
dictions agree with those made using other formulations of quantum mechanics.
Furthermore, it is independent of the other formulations. On another planet, it
might be the method of doing quantum mechanics discovered ﬁrst! [11]

We believe that studying it, along with other quantum methods, deepens
understanding of quantum physics. For example, writing F G might allow one
to slip into thinking that the product of operators is similar to an ordinary
product of functions. But the ⋆-product simulates the product of operators, in
the way discussed above, and so eqn. (3) makes clear that products of operators
are tricky things.

Deformation quantization is a bit of a well-kept secret, especially at the
undergraduate level. We hope our brief discussion of it here can serve as a
gentle introduction to the subject for upper-level undergraduates, and perhaps

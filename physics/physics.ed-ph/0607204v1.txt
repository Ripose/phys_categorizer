Abstract

A simple model of eddy currents in which current is computed solely from magnetic
forces acting on electrons proves accessible to introductory students and gives a good
qualitative account of eddy current forces. However, this model cannot be complete;
it ignores the electric ﬁelds that drive current outside regions of signiﬁcant magnetic
ﬁeld. In this paper we show how to extend the model to obtain a boundary value
problem for current density. Solution of this problem in polar coordinates shows that
the electric ﬁeld signiﬁcantly aﬀects the quantitative results and presents an exercise
suitable for upper division students. We apply elliptic cylindrical coordinates to
generalize the result and oﬀer an exercise useful for teaching graduate students how
to use non-standard coordinate systems.

1.

Introduction

Every student of Electricity and Magnetism learns that Lenz’s Law predicts a force that
opposes the motion of a conductor passing through a non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Motion of
the conductor’s free charge through the ﬁeld results in magnetic forces that drive current
in the conductor. This current, in turn, interacts with the ~B ﬁeld and results in a net
magnetic force acting on the conductor. The current is called an eddy current.

A classic classroom demonstration of eddy currents is a swinging metallic pendulum
that passes through the ﬁeld of a strong magnet. Eddy currents within the conductor
damp the oscillation rapidly. When the conductor is replaced by another with holes, the
eddy currents are impeded from circulating and the damping eﬀect becomes very small.
The currents cease in this case because a Hall electric ﬁeld develops that balances the
magnetic force acting on the free charge.

We can estimate the eddy-current force acting on the conductor by using a few sim-
plifying assumptions1 ,2,3. First, model the conductor as a very large plane sheet passing
between circular magnet poles of radius a. Then, idealize the magnetic ﬁeld as uniform
in the cylindrical volume between the magnet poles and dropping abruptly to zero outside
that volume. Figure 1 illustrates the model in a view perpendicular to the conducting
sheet.

This calculation correctly illustrates Lenz’s Law and the dependence of the force on
velocity and magnetic ﬁeld strength. So, it gives a useful back-of-the-envelope estimate
for the eddy current force. However, it is a somewhat naive estimate. Once the current
leaves the vicinity of the ~B ﬁeld, the model does not explain what causes the ﬂow of free
charge. It lacks an account of the Hall electric ﬁeld (arising from charge distribution on
the surface of discontinuity of ~B) which drives the current outside the ~B-ﬁeld region, thus
completing the current loops. This ~E ﬁeld also opposes the current ﬂow within the ~B-ﬁeld
region, indicating that equation (1b) overestimates the force. In this paper we develop a
method to account for this eﬀect, and so to improve the estimate.

2. The Exact Circle Problem

Calculating the charge densities that give rise to electric ﬁelds driving current in con-
ductors is notoriously diﬃcult4, but is usually not necessary. Here we can develop the
calculation of current density as a two dimensional boundary-value problem using polar
coordinates in the rest frame of the magnets. We retain the simple model of the magnetic
ﬁeld from the introduction and, for now, model the plate as inﬁnite in the dimensions
perpendicular to the ﬁeld. We also assume that the plate’s speed is suﬃciently small that
we can model the current distribution as a quasi-steady state in the magnet frame. The
resulting problem is a challenging but accessible problem for upper division E&M students.
In classic form, we observe that the current density is derivable from a potential that sat-
isﬁes Laplace’s equation except at the magnetic ﬁeld boundary, develop the appropriate
boundary conditions and solve via expansion in eigenfunctions.

Then, the current density throughout is determined by Ohm’s Law:

where ρ is the radial coordinate with origin at the center of the magnetic ﬁeld region. Next,
since no charge buildup is expected with time, the equation of continuity demands that ~J
be divergence free:

~∇

~J = 0.

·

Since the current density is curl free except at ρ = a, it is the gradient of some scalar
~∇Φ<, where the subscripts > and <
potential on each side of a: ~J> =

refer respectively to regions outside and inside the boundary. Thus ~∇2
Φ = 0 everywhere
except at the magnetic ﬁeld boundary, and we may proceed with standard methods for
solving Laplace’s equation.

−

The boundary conditions on the components of ~J perpendicular and parallel to the
boundary follow from the divergence and curl of current density. This is a standard calcu-
lation, with the results

∂φΦ<(ρ = a−) = σav0B0 cos(φ).

eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator in polar coordinates.

more, only the A coeﬃcients are non-zero. The boundary conditions on the potential now
give two equations for the coeﬃcients. We ﬁnd:

Comparison equation (2.6) with equation (1a) shows that the current, and hence the
net force acting on the conductor is half that predicted by the naive model. Such a simple
result, in contrast with the complex correction one might have expected, rasies the issue
whether a correction factor of 1/2 is generally correct or speciﬁc to the circuclar ﬁeld
geometry. We investigate that question in the following sections.

3. Elliptical Magnetic Field Region

The result for a circular magnetic ﬁeld geometry demonstrates that electric ﬁeld has
a signiﬁcant eﬀect on eddy current ﬂow. We were intrigued whether the factor of 1/2
reduction is a general result or special to the case of circular geometry. To investigate
this question, we solved the problem of an elliptically shaped magnetic ﬁeld region with
eccentricity ǫ, as shown in Figure 2. The method follows the same outline as the circle
problem except that we expand the potential in elliptic cylindrical coordinates, deﬁned5,6
in terms of Cartesian by:

The limit η
0 describes the portion of the x-axis between the two foci. Here the curl and
divergence of ~J are both zero, so that ~J is continuous across the x-axis. Since η increases
away from the x-axis on both sides, ˆη changes direction discontinuously across the x-axis.
Thus, continuity of J⊥ implies that Jη ∝
∂ηΦ< changes sign across the x-axis. This fact
requires that the cos(ψ) term in Φ< be zero since only sin(ψ) is discontinuous at y = 0.
Now, ˆψ is also discontinuous across the x-axis between the foci, so continuity of Jk requires
cos(ψ) either be discontinuous (which it isn’t) or be zero. Thus ∂ψΦ< = 0 as

Since the force acting on the sheet is ~Fnet =

to the magnetic ﬁeld, the force also has the expected limit. It is much more intricate and
much less crucial to establish that the expression for ~J> reduces to the circular results in
the limit ǫ
0. The calculation is not given here, but a copy of it is available from the

4. The Eﬀect Of Finite Conductor Size

Once these two calculations are set up for inﬁnite plates, it is easy to estimate the
0 at

correction for ﬁnite plate size. One changes the boundary condition from
inﬁnity to vanishing of the radial component of ~J> at a ﬁnite radial coordinate.

~J>| →
|

For the circular case we take the plate to have a ﬁnite radius R. A solution is only
feasible for the time when the plate is centered on the magnetic ﬁeld region, so the result
oﬀers only an order of magnitude estimate of the eﬀects.

In eqn (2.5) (the expansion of the potential) an extra term in Φ> that increases with ρ
is necessary to match the new boundary condition. A straightforward calculation reveals:

One may quickly verify that these expressions have the correct limits (eqn 2.6) in the
inﬁnite conductor case (R
). The eﬀect on the dipole current term is substantial near
the boundary. Current in the magnetic ﬁeld region is further reduced by the edge eﬀects,
but by an insubstantial amount, unless the distance from the center to the nearest edge is
comparable to the radius of the ﬁeld region.

A similar calculation is possible for elliptic cylindrical coordinates with a border at
η = H (semi-major axis of the boundary is A = aǫ cosh(H). As in circular geometry, we

We have demonstrated that the electric ﬁeld has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the eddy-current

force computed from a simple model. The model gives the magnitude of the force as

training for a graduate student. Corrections for ﬁnite plate size alter the result by terms
of order (magnet size / plate size)2.

A possible objection to this method is the need for assuming an abrupt edge to the
magnetic ﬁeld region. Burke and Lea have developed a method for treating a more realistic

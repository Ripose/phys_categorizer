interest for the students of physis.

1 Partile on a segment

The quantum stationary states and possible values of energy of the partile on the segment of a

line is given by the Shrödinger equation

ψ(0) = ψ(a) = 0,

where m is the mass of the partile and a is the length of the segment. It is well known that the

onditions (1) and (2) lead to the energy eigenfuntions

and energy eigenvalues

The Hamiltonian of the partile in the potential well V = A(k)

is given by

(E) be the lassial periodi tra jetory of the partile with the energy E in the phase spae

Let C

(there are no tra jetories of other kind in our ase). The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule hooses

from the set of all lassial tra jetories only the tra jetories for whih

where n is natural number and γn is the quantity of the order of unity. For our purpose, it is

su(cid:30)ient to write down the rule in less aurate form

In this way, Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule gives us the method to determine approximately

the energy levels of the partile by solving the equation (9) with the unknown E and parameter n.
The auray of this formula grows with growing n. In our ase, the partile with the energy E
moves in the range [

xM (E), xM (E)], where the energy onservation law determines xM (E) as

The confusion and ambiguity encountered by students, in understanding virtual displacement
and virtual work, is addressed in this article. A deﬁnition of virtual displacement is presented that
allows one to express them explicitly for both time independent and time dependent constraints. It
is observed that for time independent constraints the virtual displacements are the displacements
allowed by the constraints. However this is not so for a general time dependent case. For simple
physical systems, it is shown that, the work done on virtual displacements by the constraint forces
is zero in both the situations. For allowed displacements however, this is not always true. It is also
demonstrated that when constraint forces do zero work on virtual displacement, as deﬁned here, we
have a solvable mechanical problem. We identify this special class of constraints, physically realized
and solvable, as the ideal constraints. The concept of virtual displacement and the principle of zero
virtual work by constraint forces are central to both Lagrange’s method of undetermined multipliers,
and Lagrange’s equations in generalized coordinates.

From the concept
of zero work by virtual displacement the Lagrange’s
equations of motion are derived. However, the deﬁnition
of virtual displacement is rarely made precise and often
seems vague and ambiguous to students. In this article
we attempt a more systematic and precise deﬁnition,
which not only gives one a qualitative idea of virtual
displacement, but also allows one to quantitatively
express the same for any given constrained system.
We show that in a number of natural systems, e.g.,
particle moving on a frictionless slope, pendulum with
moving point of suspension, the work done by the forces
of constraint due to virtual displacement is zero. We
also demostrate that this condition is necessary for the
solvability of a mechanical problem. Hence we propose
such systems as an important class of natural systems.

A. Ambiguity in virtual displacement

In the following we try to classify the diﬃculties faced
by a student in understanding the deﬁnition of virtual
displacement.

1. It is claimed that (i)a virtual displacement δr is
consistent with the forces and constraints imposed
on the system at a given instant t1; (ii) a virtual dis-
placement is an arbitrary, instantaneous, inﬁnites-
imal change of position of the system compatible
with the conditions of constraint2; (iii) virtual dis-
placements are, by deﬁnition, arbitrary displace-

ments of the components of the system, satisfy-
ing the constraint3; (iv) virtual displacement does
not violate the constraints8; (v) we deﬁne a vir-
tual displacement as one which does not violate the
kinematic relations10; (vi) the virtual displacements
obey the constraint on the motion11. These state-
ments imply that the virtual displacements satisfy
the constraint conditions, i.e., the constraint equa-
tions. However this is true only for time indepen-
dent (sclerenomous) constraints. We shall show
that for time dependent (rheonomous) constraints,
such as a pendulum with moving support, this def-
inition would violate the zero virtual work condi-
tion.

2. It is also stated that (i)virtual displacement is to
be distinguished from an actual displacement of the
system occurring in a time interval dt1; (ii) it is
an arbitrary, instantaneous, change of position of
the system2; (iii) virtual displacement δr takes place
without any passage of time8. (iv) virtual displace-
ment has no connection with the time - in contrast
to a displacement which occurs during actual mo-
tion, and which represents a portion of the actual
path9; (v) one of the requirements on acceptable
virtual displacement is that the time is held ﬁxed11.
We even notice equation like ‘δxi = dxi for dt = 0’8.
The above statements are puzzling to a student. If
position is a continuous function of time, a change
in position during zero time has to be zero.
In
other words, this deﬁnition implies that the vir-
tual displacement cannot possibly be an inﬁnitesi-
mal (or diﬀerential) of any continuous function of
time. In words of Arthur Haas: since its (virtual
displacement) components are thus not fucntions of
the time, we are not able to regard them as diﬀer-
entials, as we do for the components of the element

of the actual path9. We shall show that virtual dis-
placement can be looked upon as a diﬀerential, it
is indeed a diﬀerential increment in virtual velocity
over a time dt, Eq.(6).

3. It is also stated that (i) virtual displacements do
not necessarily conform to the constraints4; (ii) the
virtual displacements δq have nothing to do with
actual motion. They are introduced, so to speak, as
test quantities, whose function it is to make the sys-
tem reveal something about its internal connections
and about the forces acting on it2; (iii) the word
“virtual” is used to signify that the displacements
are arbitrary, in the sense that they need not corre-
spond to any actual motion executed by the system3;
(iv) it is not necessary that it (virtual displacement)
represents any actual motion of the system6; (v)
it is not intended to say that such a displacement
(virtual) occurs during the motion of the particle
considered, or even that it could occur9; (vi)virtual
displacement is any arbitrary inﬁnitesimal displace-
ment not necessarily along the constrained path5.
From the above we understand that the virtual
displacemnts do not always satisfy the constraint
equations, and they need not be the ones actually
realized. We shall see that these statements are
consistent with physical situations, but they cannot
serve as a satisfactory deﬁnition of virtual displace-
ment. Statements like: “not necessarily conform to
the constraints” or “not necessarily along the con-
strained path” only tell us what virtual displace-
ment is not, they do not tell us what it really is.
Reader should note that there is a conﬂict between
the claims under items 1 and 3. It is not clear from
the above, whether the virtual displacements sat-
isfy the constraints, i.e., the constraint equations
or not.

4. Virtual displacement is variously described as: ar-
bitrary, virtual, and imaginary1,2,3,5,6. These adjec-
tives make the deﬁnition somewhat mysterious to
a student.

Together with the above ambiguities, students are of-
ten confused as to whether it suﬃces to understand vir-
tual displacement as an abstract concept, or they need to
have a quantitative deﬁnition. Some students appreciate
that the virtual displacement as a vector should not be
ambiguous. The principle of zero virtual work is used
to derive Lagrange’s equations. For a particle under con-
straint this means that the virtual displacement is always
orthogonal to the force of constraint.

At this stage a student may get further puzzled.
Should he take the forces of constraint as supplied, and
then the principle of zero virtual work as a deﬁnition
of virtual displacement ? In that case the principle re-
duces merely to a deﬁnition of a new concept, namely
virtual displacement. Or should the virtual displacement
be deﬁned from the constraint conditions independently

2

? The principle of zero virtual work may then be used to
calculate the forces of constraint that ensure constraint
condition throughout the motion.

II. VIRTUAL DISPLACEMENT AND FORCES
OF CONSTRAINT

A. Constraints and Virtual displacement

Let us consider a system of constraints that are ex-
pressible as equations involving positions and time. They
represent some geometric restrictions (holonomic) either
independent of time (sclerenomous) or explicitly depen-
dent on it (rheonomous). Hence for a system of N par-
ticles moving in three dimensions, a system of (s) holo-
nomic, rheonomous constraints are represented by func-
tions of rk and (t),

fi(r1, r2, . . . , rN , t) = 0,

i = 1, 2, . . . , s

(1)

Each constraint of this form imposes a restriction on the
possible or allowed velocities, which must satisfy,

N

k=1 (cid:18)
X

∂fi
∂rk (cid:19)

· vk +

∂fi
∂t

= 0,

i = 1, 2, . . . , s

(2)

It is worth noting at this stage that there are many, in
fact inﬁnitely many, allowed velocities, since we have im-
posed only (s) number of constraints on (3N ) scalar com-
ponents of the allowed velocity vectors. An inﬁnitesimal
displacement over time (dt) due to allowed velocities will
be called the allowed inﬁnitesimal displacement or simply
allowed displacement.

drk = vkdt

k = 1, 2, . . . , N

(3)

Allowed displacements drk together with diﬀerential of
time (dt) satisfy constraint equations similar to Eq.(2).

∂rk (cid:19)

· drk +

∂fi

dt = 0,

i = 1, 2, . . . , s (4)

As there are many allowed velocities we have many al-
lowed inﬁnitesimal displacements. We propose to deﬁne
virtual displacement as the diﬀerence between any two
such (unequal) allowed displacements,

δrk = drk − dr′
k,

k = 1, 2, . . . , N

(5)

This deﬁnition is motivated by the possibility of identi-
fying a special class of ‘ideal constraints’ (sec. IIc), and
verifying ‘the principle of zero virtual work’ in common
physical examples (sec. III). It may be noted that, by
this deﬁnition, virtual displacement δrk is not a change
in position in zero time. It is rather the diﬀerence of any
two allowed displacements during a time dt.

δrk = (vk − v′

k)dt,

k = 1, 2, . . . , N

(6)

The diﬀerence of two allowed velocities
be deﬁned as the virtual velocity.

vk = vk −v′

The virtual displacements thus deﬁned satisfy the ho-
mogeneous part of the constraint equation Eq.(4) (i.e.,
with ∂fi/∂t = 0).

· δrk = 0,

i = 1, 2, . . . , s

(7)

The absence of the (∂fi/∂t) in the above equation,
Eq.(7), gives the precise meaning to the statement that
virtual displacements are the allowed displacements in the
case of frozen constraints. The constraints are frozen in
time in the sense that we make the (∂fi/∂t) term zero,
though the ∂fi/∂rk term still involves time. In the case of
stationary constraints, i.e., f (r1, . . . , rN ) = 0, the virtual
displacements are identical with allowed displacements as
(∂fi/∂t) is zero.

B. Existence of forces of constraints

In the case of an unconstrained system of N particles
described by position vectors (rk) and velocity vectors
(vk), the motion is governed by Newton’s Law,

mkak = Fk(rl, vl, t),

k, l = 1, 2, . . . , N (8)

where mk is the mass of the kth particle, ak is its ac-
celeration and Fk is the total external force acting on it.
However, for a constrained system, the equations of con-
straint, namely Eq.(1), impose the following restrictions
on the allowed accelerations,

· ak +

∂rk (cid:19)

(cid:18)

vk +

d
dt

∂fi
∂t

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

= 0,

Given rk, vk one is no longer free to choose all the ac-
celerations ak independently. Therefore in general the
accelerations ak allowed by Eq.(9) are incompatible with
Newton’s Law,

mkak = Fk,

k = 1, 2, . . . , N

This implies that during the motion the constraint con-
dition cannot be maintained by the external forces alone.
Physically some additional forces, e.g., normal reaction
from the surface of constraint, tension in the pendulum
string, come into play to ensure that the constraints are
satisﬁed, Hence one is compelled to introduce forces of
constraints Rk and modify the equations of motion as,

mkak = Fk + Rk,

k = 1, 2, . . . , N

(10)

Now the problem is to determine the motion of N parti-
cles, namely their positions (rk(t)), velocities (vk(t)) and
the forces of constraints (Rk), for a given set of external

3

forces Fk, constraint equations (fi(r1, r2, . . . , rN , t) = 0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , s) and initial conditions (rk(0), vk(0)). It is
important that the initial conditions are also compatible
with the constraints.

There are a total of (6N ) scalar unknowns, namely the
components of rk(t) and Rk, connected by (3N ) equa-
tions of motion, Eq.(10), and (s) equations of constraints,
Eq.(1). For (6N > 3N + s) we have an under-determined
system. Hence to solve this problem we need (3N − s)
additional scalar relations.

C. Solvability and ideal constraints

In simple problems with stationary constraints, e.g.,
motion on a smooth stationary surface, we observe that
the allowed displacements are tangential to the surface.
The virtual displacement being a diﬀerence of two such
allowed displacements, is also a vector tangential to it.
The force of constraint, so called ‘normal reaction’, is
perpendicular to the surface. Hence the work done by
the constraint forces on allowed as well as virtual dis-
placement is zero,

Rk · drk = 0,

Rk · δrk = 0

When the constraint surface is in motion, the allowed
velocities, and hence the allowed displacements are no
longer tangent to the surface (see sec. III). The virtual
displacement remains tangent to the constraint surface.
If the forces of constraint can still be assumed normal to
the instantaneous position of the surface, we have zero
virtual work. However note that the work by constraint
forces on allowed displacements is not zero.

In a number of physically interesting simple problems,
such as, motion of a pendulum with ﬁxed and moving
support, motion of a particle along a stationary and mov-
ing slope, we observe that the above interesting relation
between the force of constraint and virtual displacement
holds (see sec.
III). Out of the above 3N virtual dis-
placements, only n = 3N − s are independent. If the (s)
dependent quantities are expressed in terms of remaining
n = 3N − s independent objects we get

under-determined) again.

Thus we ﬁnd a special class of constraints which is
observed in nature (see sec.
III) and which gives us a
solvable system. We call this special class of constraints,
satisfying zero virtual work principle by constraint forces,
i.e.,

Rk · δrk = 0, the ideal constraint.

P

Our interpretation of the principle of zero virtual work,
as a deﬁnition of an ideal class of constraints, ﬁnd sup-
port in Sommerfeld. In his words, “a general postulate of
mechanics: in any mechanical systems the virtual work
of the reactions equals zero. Far be it from us to want to
give a general proof of this postulate, rather we regard it
practically as deﬁnition of a mechanical system ”.

III. EXAMPLES OF VIRTUAL
DISPLACEMENTS

A. Simple Pendulum with stationary support

The motion of the pendulum is conﬁned to a plane and
the bob moves at a ﬁxed distance from the point of sus-
pension. The equation of constraint by Eq.(1) therefore
is,

f (x, y, t)

.
= x2 + y2 − r2

0 = 0

Whence

∂f
∂x

The allowed displacements are always collinear to al-
lowed velocities. Virtual displacement being diﬀerence
of two allowed displacements, is also a vector collinear
to the allowed velocities, hence tangential to the line of
suspension.

dr = vdt,

dr′ = v′dt

δr = (v − v′)dt

We may assume that the string of the pendulum provides
a tension (T) but no shear (ideal string). We get zero
work by tension due to allowed and virtual displacements,

T · dr = 0,

T · δr = 0

B. Simple Pendulum with moving support

Let us ﬁrst consider the case when the support is mov-
ing vertically with a velocity u. The motion of the pen-
dulum is still conﬁned to a plane. The bob moves keeping
a ﬁxed distance from point of suspension. The equation
of constraint is,

f (x, y, t)

.
= x2 + (y − ut)2 − r2

0 = 0

where u is the velocity of the point of suspension along
a vertical direction.

Hence the constraint equation for allowed velocities

(compare Eq.(2)) is,

x · vx + y · vy = 0

FIG. 2: Allowed and virtual displacements for a pendulum
with moving support

Hence the allowed velocity (vx, vy) is orthogonal to the
instantaneous position (x,y) of the bob relative to sta-
tionary support. The same may also be veriﬁed taking a
plane polar coordinate.

Whence

∂f
∂x

∂f
∂y

= 2x,

= 2(y − ut),

= −2u(y − ut)

∂f
∂t

Hence the constraint equation gives,

x · vx + (y − ut) · vy − u(y − ut) = 0

or,

x · vx + (y − ut) · (vy − u) = 0

Hence the allowed velocities (vx, vy) and hence the al-
lowed displacements, are not orthogonal to the instanta-
neous position (x,y −ut) of the bob relative to the instan-
taneous position of the support. It is easy to verify from
the above equation that the allowed velocity (vx, vy) is
equal to the sum of a velocity vector (vx, vy − u) perpen-
dicular to the relative position of the bob with respect
to the point of suspension (x,y − ut), and the velocity of
the support (0, u).

v = vt + u

The allowed displacements are vectors collinear to al-
lowed velocities. A virtual displacement being the diﬀer-
ence of two allowed displacements, is a vector collinear to
the diﬀerence of allowed velocities. Hence it is tangential
to the instantaneous line of suspension.

dr = vdt = vtdt + udt
δr = (v − v′)dt = (vt − v′

t)dt

At any given instant string provides a tension along its
length, with no shear (ideal string). Hence the constraint
force, tension, still does zero work on virtual displace-
ment.

T · dr 6= 0,

T · δr = 0

If one considers the support moving in a horizontal (or in
any arbitrary direction), one can show that the allowed
displacement is not normal to the instantaneous line of
suspension. But the virtual displacement as deﬁned in
this article always remains perpendicular to the instan-
taneous line of support.

FIG. 3: Allowed and virtual displacements for a particle on a
stationary slope

If the inclined slope is frictionless (ideal), the constraint
force provided by the surface is the normal reaction;
which is perpendicular to the plane. Hence the work done
by this force on allowed as well as virtual displacement
is zero.

N · dr = 0,

N · δr = 0

D. Motion along a moving inclined plane

For an inclined plane moving along the horizontal side,

the constraint is given by,

(x + ut)
y

− cot(θ0) = 0

f (x, y)

.
= (x + ut) − cot(θ0)y = 0

whence the constraint for allowed velocities Eq.(2) be-
come,

( ˙x + u) − cot(θ0) ˙y = 0

Hence the allowed velocity ( ˙x, ˙y) is the sum of two vec-
tors, one along the plane ( ˙x + u, ˙y), and the other equal
to the velocity of the plane itself (−u, 0).

The constraint is more conveniently expressed in the

polar coordinate. The constraint equation is,

v = vt + u

f (r, θ)

.
= θ − θ0 = 0

where θ0 is a constant. Hence the constraint equation for
allowed velocities, Eq.(2), gives,

Thus the allowed velocities are along the constant θ

ments are,

Allowed displacements are vectors along the allowed
velocities, however the virtual displacement is still a vec-
tor along the instantaneous position of the plane.

dr = (vt + u)dt,
δr = (v − v′)dt = (vt − v′

dr′ = (v′

t + u)dt

For the moving frictionless (ideal) slope, the constraint
force provided by the surface is perpendicular to the

virtual displacement is remains zero.

If the components of δrk were independent, we could re-

pendent through the constraint equations,

fi(r1, r2, . . . , rN , t) = 0,

by s scalar multipliers (λ1, λ2, . . . λs), called the La-
grange’s multipliers, and subtract them from the zero
virtual work equation, Eq.(13).

The constraint equations Eq.(15) allows us to write the
(s) dependent virtual displacements in terms of the re-
maining n = 3N − s independent ones. We choose (s)
multipliers (λ1, λ2, . . . , λs) such that the coeﬃcients of
(s) dependent components of virtual displacement van-
ish. The remaining virtual displacements being indepen-
dent, their coeﬃcients must vanish as well. Thus it is pos-
sible to choose (λ1, λ2, . . . , λs) such that all coeﬃcients
([X]k,[Y ]k,[Z]k) of virtual displacements (δxk,δyk,δzk) in
Eq.(18) vanish. Hence we have the forces of constraint
in terms of the Lagrange’s multipliers.

fi(r1, r2, . . . , rN , t) = 0,

i = 1, 2, . . . , s

(21)

Thus we have to solve 3N + s scalar equations in 3N + s
unknown scalar quantities (xk, yk, zk, λi). After solving
this system we can obtain the forces of constraint Rk
from Eq.(19).

V. GENERALIZED COORDINATES AND
LAGRANGE’S EQUATIONS OF MOTION

For the sake of completeness we discuss very brieﬂy
Lagrange’s equations in generalized coordinates (for de-
tail see1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13). Consider a system of N
particles under s holonomic, rheonomous constraints of
the form given by Eq.(1). We can in principle express
s of these coordinates in terms of the remaining 3N − s
independent ones. Or we may express all the 3N scalar
components of position in terms of n = 3N − s indepen-
dent parameters q1, q2, . . . , qn and time (t).

rk = rk(q1, q2, . . . , qn, t),

VI. CONCLUSION

7

In this article we make an attempt to present a quan-
titative deﬁnition of the virtual displacement. We show
that for certain simple cases the virtual displacement
does zero work on forces of constraint. We also demon-
strate that this zero work principle allows us to have a
solvable class of problems. Hence we deﬁne this special
class of constraint, the ideal constraint. We demonstrate
in brief how one can solve a general mechanical problem
by: i) Lagrange’s method of undetermined multiplier and
ii) Lagrange’s equations in generalized coordinates.

In Lagrange’s method of undetermined multipliers we
have to solve a larger number (3N + s) of equations, than
in the case of Lagrange’s equations (3N − s) in general-
ized coordinates. However we can immediately derive the
forces of (ideal) constraints in the former case.

It is interesting to note that both the abovementioned
methods require the zero virtual work by constraint
In the case of La-
forces as a crucial starting point.
grange’s method of undetermined multipliers we start
with the ideal constraint condition Eq.(13). From there
we write down Eq.(14), Eq.(17), Eq.(18) and express
the constraint forces in terms of Lagrange’s multipliers,
Eq.(19). For Lagrange’s equations in generalized coor-
dinates we start with the ideal constraint, Eq.(13). We
work our way through Eq.(14), Eq.(24), Eq.(26) and ﬁ-
nally obtain Lagrange’s equations in generalized coordi-
nates, Eq.(27) and Eq.(31).

High temperature expansion of the partition funtion for a partile on a

segment of a line is done in this paper to show an example of the quantum

system whih thermodynamial funtions do not approah the thermody-

namial funtions of its lassial ounterpart at high temperature. The

problem might be interesting for the students and teahers beause by a

olletion of noninterating partiles traped in a box at su(cid:30)iently high

temperature and low density one often imitates the lassial ideal gas.

Now, let us turn to the ase of quantum linear osillator, for simpliity, in

Within the quantum mehanis we should impose some boundary on-

ditions on the wave funtion ψ = ψ(x),

following boundary onditions: ψ(0) = ψ(L) = 0 hold. Then the eigenen-

Our purpose is to ompute the mean energy of this partile at the tem-

perature T and to show that in the limit T
→ ∞ mean energy does not
approah the equipartition value kT /2. For the simpliity, we will hoose

The above written sums, unfortunately, an not be evaluated in terms of

elementary funtions. Beause of our main interest we need only to know

the high-temperature expansion of these sums. And it is possible to get

it quite easy as it is shown bellow. So, we have to deal with the partition

Figure 1: Left graph shows the temperature dependene of the di(cid:27)erene between

the mean energy given by the eq. (10) and equipartition term T /2. On the right

graph we see the temperature dependene of the spei(cid:28) heat (7). We see, that

spei(cid:28) heat approahes the lassial value 1/2 as T goes to in(cid:28)nity. Spei(cid:28) heat

We see that the mean energy of our partile within quantum statistial

physis di(cid:27)ers from the mean energy of suh a partile within lassial

statatistial physis (4) and this di(cid:27)erene grows with the temperature like

T +1/2

- so it is not true that in the limit T

→ ∞ one has to obtain lassial

results from the quantum ones. To ompare results (10) and (4) one should

rewrite the result (10) into standard system of units in whih the (cid:28)rst two

terms of (10) read

It is natural that the orretion term to the equipartition term kT /2 on-

tains the Plank onstant beause of its quantum origin. Plak onstant

makes it small for the realisti values of m and L. It would be useful to

realise that in the three dimensional analogue of our problem we would get

On the other hand the spei(cid:28) heat approahes the equipartition value k/2

Simple derivation of the three leading terms of the eq. (10)

We woul like to show how to get the (cid:28)rst three terms of the eq. (10) in a

muh elementary way as it was done above. Our next approah will be less

aurate and will not o(cid:27)er the way how to get next terms of the expansion

(10). We take the sum (8) and perform the following manipulations:

So, we have got a part of the result from previous paragraph in a relatively

easy manner.

3 Disussion and onluding remarks

It an be very easy for a student to get used to believe that for any quantum

system the high temperature limits of its thermodynamial funtions have

to be equal to their lassial ounterparts. We have shown in the seond

setion of this work that this statement is not true. We have shown that

"the orretions" to this statement an be arbitrarily large at high tempera-

ture. On the other hand these "arbitrarily large orretions" are su(cid:30)iently

small for realisti values of mass, box dimensions and temperature beause

of the small value of the Plank onstant. So, we have not found any in-

teresting observable predition of the quantum mehanis in this paper but

we wanted to draw the attention to the quite interesting problem of the

high temperature limit of general quantum system. There are some math-

ematially exat results in this problem but they do not onsider general

systems. In [4℄ and referenes ited therein an be found general results -

inequalities between partition funtion and its lassial approximation - for

the systems of partiles moving in spae without boundaries. It is possible

to derive these inequalities by using the oherent states whih are not de-

(cid:28)ned for a partile say in a box.

Now let us turn to some interesting questions and suggestions. The (cid:28)rst

question is what is the prinipial di(cid:27)erene between the linear harmoni

osillator and the partile on the intervals that auses the di(cid:27)erent feature

of the high temperature expansion of the mean energies of these systems?

We an answer to this question as follows. The energy gap between near-by

energy levels of the osillator is a onstant (~ω) so there is suh a temper-
ature T0 that for T > T0 the thermal energy kT is bigger than the energy

gap. For the seond system this statement is not true beause the energy

gaps between near-by levels grow as n. To test this statement the readers

would try to (cid:28)nd the mean energy at (cid:28)nite temperature of the following

0) in the (cid:28)eld of potential
system: partile moving on a half-line (say x
energy V (x) = k2x (eletron in the homogenous eletri (cid:28)eld). The gaps
between the energy levels of this system derease as n−1/3

≥

(show this with-

out solving the Shrödinger equation!).

Another task ould be to reognise whether the hoie of the boundary

onditions

imposed on the wave funtion of a partile on an interval an

Let us mention that the boundary onditions in the quantum mehanis annot be hosen

arbirarily. For instane in our ase we have the ondition

0 ψ(x)φ′′(x)dx =

0 φ(x)ψ′′(x)dx

a(cid:27)et the high temperature expansion of the mean energy.

It might also be useful to disuss the possibility to extend the results of the

seond setion of this work to the system of noninterating partiles and to

(cid:28)nd the orretions to the entropy (Sakor-Tetrode equation), free energy

and pressure (state-equation) of the lassial ideal gas.

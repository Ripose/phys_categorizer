The dynamics of a liquid dielectric attracted by a vertical cylindrical capacitor is studied.

Contrary to what might be expected from the standard calculation of the force exerted by

the capacitor, the motion of the dielectric is diﬀerent depending on whether the charge or the

voltage of the capacitor is held constant. The problem turns out to be an unconventional

example of dynamics of a system with variable mass, whose velocity can, in certain cir-

cumstances, suﬀer abrupt changes. Under the hypothesis that the voltage remains constant

the motion is described in qualitative and quantitative details, and a very brief qualitative

discussion is made of the constant charge case.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Electric forces on insulating bodies are notoriously diﬃcult to calculate [1]. Only in very special

instances can the calculation be performed by elementary means. The simplest case, treated in

every undergraduate textbook on electricity and magnetism, is that of a dielectric slab attracted

by a parallel-plate capacitor. Nearly as simple is the determination of the force of attraction on

a liquid dielectric by a vertical cylindrical capacitor.

It is remarkable that, under appropriate

conditions, in both cases conservation of energy alone leads to a simple expression for the force

with no need to know the complicated fringing ﬁeld responsible for the attraction. Conservation of

energy leads to the same expression for the force independently of whether the voltage or the charge

of the capacitor is assumed to remain constant during a hypothetical inﬁnitesimal displacement

of the dielectric. It is reassuring that a detailed treatment based on a direct consideration of the

fringing ﬁeld leads to the same result [2]. Since the dynamics of the dielectric under such a force

is not discussed in the textbooks, one may be left with the false impression that the motion is

unaﬀected by the choice of constant voltage or constant charge.

In this paper we study the dynamics of a liquid dielectric pulled into a vertical cylindrical

capacitor by electrostatic forces. The motion is quantitatively diﬀerent, though qualitatively the

same, depending on whether the voltage or the charge of the capacitor is held constant. It will be

seen that this is a very peculiar variable-mass system, since in certain circumstances the velocity

can change abruptly during a very short time interval right after the beginning of the motion.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the elementary calculation of the

force exerted by a vertical cylindrical capacitor on a liquid dielectric. In Section 3 the dynamics is

investigated assuming the voltage applied to the capacitor stays constant. The motion of the liquid

near the bottom edge is described qualitatively only, since our expression for the electrostatic force

is not valid near the ends of the capacitor. For the motion when the surface of the dielectric is

well inside the capacitor quantitative results are obtained. In Section 3 we brieﬂy discuss the case

in which the charge of the capacitor is held ﬁxed, and a qualitative description of the motion is

given. Section 4 is devoted to ﬁnal comments and conclusions.

II. FORCE OF A CYLINDRICAL CAPACITOR ON A LIQUID DIELECTRIC

Let us consider a coaxial cylindrical capacitor of length L whose inner and outer radii are a

and b, respectively, with L

b. Suppose the capacitor is in the vertical position and is partially

≫

immersed in a liquid dielectric contained in a tank, in such a way that the surface of the liquid

that has entered the capacitor is far from its ends. If a potential diﬀerence is applied between the

capacitor plates, the dielectric will be pulled into the capacitor. The calculation of the force of

attraction is a textbook problem [3] which we proceed to work out for subsequent use.

Let L0 be the length of the capacitor that is immersed in the liquid before the voltage is turned

on. After the voltage is turned on the liquid inside the capacitor rises to the height L0 + x , as

depicted in Fig 1. Let λ1 and λ2 be the linear charge densities on the parts of the inner plate

that are in empty space and in contact with the dielectric, respectively. The corresponding electric

ﬁelds in vacuum and inside the dielectric are

E1 =

ˆs , E2 =

λ1
2πǫ0s

λ2
2πǫs

ˆs ,

(1)

where ˆs is the radial unit vector and ǫ is the permittivity of the dielectric. The voltage V applied

to the capacitor is given by the radial line integral either of E1 or E2:

From this the capacitance can be readily found. Indeed, the total charge of the capacitor is

where χe is the electric susceptibility of the dielectric.

The force on the dielectric can be determined by equating the work done by the capacitor

during a displacement dx of the dielectric to the decrease of the electrostatic energy stored in the

capacitor. Thus, assuming the charge Q of the capacitor remains constant as the displacement

where Eq. (4) has been used. Since this force is positive, the dielectric is pulled into the capacitor.

As is well known, the same result is obtained for the force if, instead of the charge Q, the voltage V

of the capacitor is assumed to remain constant during the displacement. But in the latter case the

battery responsible for maintaining the voltage ﬁxed does work as the dielectric is displaced, and

this work must be taken into account in the energy balance [3]. Since the expression for the force

is the same in both cases, it may seem obvious that the motion of the liquid dielectric does not

depend on whether the charge or the voltage is held constant. This is not the case, however, for a

reason that may be easily overlooked. If the voltage is held constant then the force (5) is constant

during the entire motion. However, if the charge Q remains constant then, using V = Q/C and

Eq. (4), the force (5) becomes

F =

Q2
C 2

πǫ0χe
ln(b/a)

=

Q2
4πǫ0

χe ln(b/a)
[L + χe(L0 + x)]2 .

This is a variable force that depends on the position of the dielectric because the capacitance

increases and the voltage decreases as the dielectric penetrates the capacitor. Therefore, the

dynamics of the dielectric is diﬀerent depending on whether the charge or the voltage of the

capacitor is constant throughout the motion.

III. EQUATION OF MOTION OF THE LIQUID DIELECTRIC

The equation of motion of the liquid dielectric is

d

(m ˙x) = F + ρgL0π(b2

a2)

mg

−

−

where m is the mass of the dielectric that is already inside the capacitor at time t. The presence

of the term proportional to L0 on the right-hand side of (7) is justiﬁed as follows. The pressure

at the bottom of the liquid column that is inside the capacitor is higher than the pressure at the

top by ρgL0, where ρ is the density of the dielectric. This gives rise to a net upward pressure force
a2) and must be added to the electrostatic force F . We have assumed that
that equals ρgL0π(b2
−
a2), so that the variation of the height of the liquid
the area of the tank is much larger than π(b2

in the tank can be safely ignored. Other hypotheses will be mentioned in due time.

The mass of liquid inside the capacitor is

m = π(b2

This equation has the equilibrium solution ξeq = 1 + α, which is tantamount to xeq = a0. Thus, a0

is the height at which the weight of the dielectric that has risen above the external level is exactly

counterbalanced by the electric force that pulls it up.

Equation (14) can be solved by standard techniques. First of all we make a change of indepen-

A. Close to the edge: a qualitative description

Equation (5) is adequate for the force only when the surface of the liquid is far from the edges

of the capacitor. Therefore, it is not legitimate to put L0 = 0 in equation (10). Nevertheless,

something remarkable happens when one considers L0 = 0. Since the attraction is caused by the

fringing ﬁeld, it is clear that the force on the liquid dielectric is not zero when its surface just

touches the lower edge of the capacitor. Suppose that at t = 0 the liquid is at rest, the voltage is

turned on and the upward motion begins with ξ = 0. Then the “ﬁrst” ascending layer of the liquid

has zero mass but is pulled into the capacitor with a ﬁnite force. Thus, ideally, it is subjected

to an inﬁnite acceleration, which brings about a ﬁnite jump of the velocity. Sure enough there is

a transient process during which the electric ﬁeld builds up and the velocity changes continuosly.

However, since the time scale of this transient process is certainly much shorter than the time

scale of the motion, it seems reasonable to expect that it can be satisfactorily modelled by a

discontinuous jump of the velocity. Furthermore, the value attained by the velocity right after the

transient, when so to speak the electrostatic force takes over, most likely cannot be freely chosen.

This is a very peculiar behavior of this unconventional variable-mass system, whose mass can drop

to zero at certain instants in the course of its motion.

It turns out that this unique behavior is nicely illustrated, at least in some of its main qualitative

aspects, by our description. In order to check this statement let us try to ﬁnd out what the equation

of motion has to tell us about the dynamics of the liquid near the edge of the capacitor, although

the quantitative results are admittedly unreliable.

With α = 0 because we are taking L0 = 0, the initial condition ξ(0) = 0 demands p(0) =

1,

as plainly seen from either (14) or (16). Accordingly, since ξ starts to increase immediately after

t = 0, we take for initial conditions ξ(0) = 0 and p(0) = 1, a choice that leads to C = 0 in equation

(22). As a consequence, Eq.(22) can be solved for p in the form

It is clear that ξ attains its maximum value ξmax = 3/2 at τ = 3, and returns to its initial value

results are not trustworthy and the cusps at the turning points will be smoothed out in the actual

motion, but the qualitative nature of the dynamics seems to be well represented by our description.

B. Far from the edge: a quantitative description

Let us suppose now that L0

L/2, where L is the length of the capacitor, so that the liquid

≈

starts its motion well inside the capacitor. In this case our appoach is expected to be fairly realistic,

and furnish quantitative results that can be taken seriously. If the ﬂuid is at rest when the voltage

is turned on, the initial conditions are x(0) = 0 and ˙x(0) = 0, which are equivalent to ξ(0) = α
and ˙ξ(0) = 0 according to equation (13).
C = α3/3

In this case the constant of integration is given by

the motion can be obtained without using these not so familiar functions. To this end note that

equation (25) is formally equivalent to the one that describes the motion of a particle with zero
“total energy” in the “potential” V (ξ). The positivity of the “kinetic energy” ξ2 ˙ξ2/2 constrains ξ

to the region V (ξ)

0. Since x

0, in terms of ξ the physically allowed region is ξ

α, as follows

from Eq.(13).

The function V (ξ) has the following properties: (i) V (α) = 0; (ii) V ′(α) =

solution to V ′(ξ) = 0, which is readily found to be ξeq = 1 + α and corresponds to xeq = a0. This

result for ξeq is merely a conﬁrmation of what was found directly from the equation of motion (14).

Now we have enough information to draw a qualitative graph of the “potential”, which is depicted

in Fig. 3. The motion is conﬁned to the “potential well” shown in the same ﬁgure.

by ξ is the only positive value ξ = ξmax > α such that V (ξ) equals zero. In the region ξ > ξmax the

“potential” is positive and the motion is forbidden. The amplitude ξmax is the positive solution to

An expression for T in terms of elliptic integrals is given in the Appendix.

Unfortunately, under normal laboratory conditions the oscillation of the surface of the liquid

will be very hard to observe. In order to make a0 and t0 as large as possible, one needs a low-

density liquid with very high susceptibility. Not only a and b but also their diﬀerence should be

as small as possible, while the voltage should be as high as possible. However, these choices are

limited, among other things, by the dielectric strength of the liquid. The dielectric strength of
typical insulators [4] is about 107 V/m. The maximum electric ﬁeld inside the capacitor is easily
seen to be Emax = V /a ln(b/a), so that one must have V < 107 a ln(b/a), with a and b in meters.

Furthermore, the diﬀerence b

a cannot be too small lest capillarity becomes dominant. To give an

−

idea of the order of magnitudes involved, consider pure water, for which ρ

and χe ≈

79.

Take a = 1.0 cm, b = 2.0 cm, L = 20 cm, L0 = 10 cm, and V = 5000 volts, a very high voltage.

Then from (12) and (13) we obtain a0 = 0.86 cm, t0 = 30 ms and α = 11.6, so that ξmax = 13.6.
It follows that the amplitude of the oscillation is xmax ≈
calculated in the Appendix is T = 0.93 s. It should be stressed that these values for the amplitude

2a0 = 1.7 cm. The period of oscillation

and the period require an extremely high voltage.

be given following the pattern set by the previous case. The shape of the “potential” is exactly the

same as the one shown in Fig. 3. The motion is periodic and conﬁned to the interval α
where, now, ¯ξmax is determined by a transcendental equation because of the logarithmic term in

(35), which prevents us from giving an explicit expression for the amplitude of the oscillation. The

period is also given by a complicated integral involving the square root of a logarithm.

VI. CONCLUSION

The motion of a liquid dielectric attracted by a vertical cylindrical capacitor is an unusual

example of dynamics of a variable-mass system. As we have seen, because the initial mass vanishes

for motion of the liquid near the lower edge of the capacitor with the most natural initial conditions,

the velocity change can be qualitatively modelled by a jump determined by the equation of motion

itself. Assuming that the surface of the liquid remains far from the ends of the capacitor, we exactly

solved for the motion in the case of constant voltage and found not too complicated expressions

for the amplitude and the period of the oscillation. If, instead, the charge of the capacitor is held

constant, the motion is qualitatively the same but quantitative results are diﬀerent, and demand

more complicated numerical computations.

For the parameters chosen in the main text we have seen that α = 11.6. Then (A1) yields

β = 13.6 and γ = 6.26. With these values the modulus of the complete elliptic integrals is found

from (A6) to be k = 0.317. For this k the values for the complete elliptic integrals furnished by

the above power series are K(k) = 1.6125 and E(k) = 1.5306. Finally, with t0 = 30 ms equation

(A9) gives T = 0.93 s.

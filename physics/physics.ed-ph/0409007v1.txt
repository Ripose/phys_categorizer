Abstract. A simple procedure for restoring the constants in physical equations
is introduced by a consistent consideration of the correspondence between the
symbols representing physical quantities and pairs formed by numerical values and
unit symbols. This procedure is applied to the very used unit systems stressing
also the direct relations between the atomic, natural systems and SI.

To be submitted to Europ. J. Phys.

Sometimes,

A frequent procedure for obtaining simple calculations consists in setting some
interpretation
fundamental constants equal to unity.
reasons, it is necessary to restore these constants in the physical equations and in
their solutions. This is just the point less treated in the textbooks (see for example
[1, 2]). There are some general theoretical expositions in the literature on this problem
[3] but here we adopt a practical point of view trying to give some simple notation
and prescriptions for restoring the constants in any expression. Illustrations for the
very used unit systems as the atomic and natural ones are presented. Certainly,
such notation and prescriptions are almost everyday discovered and rediscovered by
professors and students teaching or learning physics. The present note, not claimed
as an original one, is intended as a didactic teaching aid for the beginners in physics.
Let us an unit system labeled by α. A physical quantity X is speciﬁed in the
given system by the correspondence X
where the ﬁrst element of the
−→ {
pair is a number and the second one symbolizes the unit used for measuring X. By the
relating the units of X from two systems

α and β such that

1) The atomic unit system (α = a) is introduced by the following values of

electron’s mass and charge and of the reduced Planck’s constant:

(me)a = 1, (e)a = 1, (¯h)a = 1.

(3)

Considering the relation between this system and the Gauss unit system (cgsG:
α = G), these equations introduce the atomic units of mass, action and electric
charge which, expressed in cgsG units, are represented by MaG = (me)G , SaG =
(¯h)G , QaG = (e)G . From the equations (3) we can write
−1
(me)G MGa = 1, (e)2

For passing to Heaviside-Lorentz unit system (α = H), it suﬃces to give the

for the same charges and distances in the two unit systems we have F = Q2
H /4πr2 and, using equation (1), QG = QHQHG, one obtains QHG = 1/√4π.

We may pass from the atomic system to the SI one (α = I) via the cgsG system
by well known relations. Alternatively, one may deﬁne the atomic unit system starting
from SI by writing equations (3) with the SI numerical values for me, e, ¯h and with the
substitutions G
we can impose still
I. Because there are four basic units in SI
another condition. From Coulomb’s law, F = Q2/4πε0r2, one sees that a reasonable
condition is

The SI version of equations (3) furnishes the atomic units for mass and electric charge

MaI = 1/MIa = (me)I , QaI = 1/QIa = (e)I .
Considering also equation (5), one obtains the atomic units for length and time:

where e0 = e/√4πε0. These results are obtained from equations (4) by using the

The same procedure is applicable to the units of velocity and energy and for the
vacuum light speed. For many applications are useful the relations for the units of
electric charge and current densities, electric and magnetic ﬁelds and electromagnetic

It is also interesting to see how the equations
(6), (7) and (9) are used for restoring the constants in Maxwell’s equations (8) and
obtaining the corresponding SI equations.

Using the values given by equations (7) and (9), after simplifying the common factors
we obtain the SI expression of the energy density w = (ε0E2 + B2/µ0)/2.

2) The natural system of units (α = n) is deﬁned by the following values of the

reduced Planck’s constant and of the vacuum light speed:

(¯h)n = 1, (c)n = 1.

These equations introduce directly the natural units of action and velocity expressed,
for example, in cgsG units, as SnG = (¯h)G , vnG = (c)G. Expressing the equations
(10) in cgsG system, one obtains

(¯h)G MGnL2

GnT

−1
Gn = 1, (c)G LGnT

−1
Gn = 1.

Concerning the fundamental units of mass, length and time, one of these units may
be chosen arbitrary and, usually, this is the length unit chosen as the Compton length
of the electron: LnG = (¯h/mec)G . From these deﬁnitions one obtains
LnG = (¯h/mec)G , TnG =
The natural unit of electric charge is obtained requiring the same formulation of
Coulomb’s law in cgsG and natural systems. We can write, using equation (2),

G , MnG = (me)G .

If equations (10) are written in SI units one obtains the natural values

MnI , LnI , TnI by the same procedure as in the case of cgsG:

¯h/mec2
(cid:0)

LnI = (¯h/mec)I , TnI =

I , MnI = (me)I .
(cid:1)
As in the atomic unit system case, we require (4πε0)n = 1 resulting (µ0)n = 4π.
Considering Coulomb’s law, required to be expressed in natural units as F = Q2/r2,
one obtains Q2
as in
equation (13).

nI = (4πε0¯hc)I and for the electron charge (e)n =

e0/√¯hc

(cid:16)

We can also derive the SI values of the units for the electric charge and current

densities, electric and magnetic ﬁelds and electromagnetic potentials:

Let us, as an example, the Dirac equation for a charged particle in an external

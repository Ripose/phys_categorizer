The electromagnetic theory of dielectric and magnetic media deals with macroscopic electric and magnetic ﬁelds,
because the microscopic details of these ﬁelds are usually experimentally irrelevant (with certain notable exceptions
such as scanning tunneling microscopy). The macroscopic ﬁelds are the average of the microscopic ﬁelds over a
microscopically large but macroscopically small region.1,2 This averaging region is often chosen to be spherical, denoted
here as

E ≡

3

4πR3 ZV

dr′ E(r′),

(1)

where V is a sphere of radius R centered at r (with a similar deﬁnition for B). R is a distance which is macroscopically
small but nonetheless large enough to enclose many atoms. The macroscopic E and B ﬁelds obtained by averaging
over a sphere exhibit properties which prove useful in certain arguments and derivations. These properties are as
follows:3,4

1. if all the sources of the E-ﬁeld are outside the sphere, then E is equal to the electric ﬁeld at the center of the

sphere,

2. if all the sources of the E-ﬁeld are inside the sphere, E = −p/(4πǫ0R3), where p is the dipole moment of the

sources with respect to the center of the sphere,

3. if all the sources of the B-ﬁeld are outside the sphere, then B is equal to the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of the

sphere,

4. if all the sources of the B-ﬁeld are inside the sphere, B = µ0m/(2πR3), where m is the magnetic dipole moment

of the sources.

These results can be derived in a variety of ways. For example, Griﬃths3 derives properties 1 and 2 using a
combination of results from Coulomb’s law and Gauss’ law, and properties 3 and 4 by writing down the B-ﬁeld in
terms of the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge, and explicitly evaluating angular integrals.5 The purpose of
this note is to describe a relatively simple derivation of all four results, based on the well-known mean-value theorem
theorem (described in most textbooks on electromagnetic theory): if a scalar potential Φ(r) satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
in a sphere, then the average of Φ over the surface of the sphere is equal to Φ at the center of the sphere;6,7 that is,
if ∇2Φ = 0 in a spherical region of radius r′ centered at r, then

Φ(r) =

1

4π I dΩ Φ(cid:16)r + r′ ˆnΩ(cid:17),

where Ω is the solid angle relative to r and ˆnΩ is the unit vector pointing in the direction of Ω.

Taking the gradient ∇ of both sides of Eq. (2) with respect to r, we immediately obtain

E(r) = −∇Φ(r) =

1

4π I dΩ h−∇Φ(cid:16)r + r′ ˆnΩ(cid:17)i =

1

4π I dΩ E(cid:16)r + r′ ˆnΩ(cid:17);

(2)

(3)

that is, if ∇ · E = 0 inside a sphere, the average of E over the surface of the sphere is equal to the E at the center of
sphere. Eq. (3) is the basis of the derivation of the four properties listed above. To simplify the notation, henceforth
in this note it is assumed that V is a sphere of radius R and is centered at the origin 0.

1. Electric ﬁeld with sources outside sphere

When all the static charge sources are outside V, E = −∇Φ and ∇ · E = 0 inside V and hence Eq. (3) is valid. We

shall now see that property 1 follows quite trivially as a special case of Eq. (3) [and hence of Eq. (2)].

The average of E over V can be written as weighted integral of the average of E over surfaces of spheres with radius

r′ < R centered at 0,

E ≡

Using Eq. (3) in Eq. (4) immediately yields property 1,

2. Electric ﬁeld with sources inside sphere

For clarity we ﬁrst prove property 2 for a single point charge inside the sphere. The general result can be inferred
from the single point charge result using the superposition principle, but for completeness we generalize the proof for
a continuous charge distribution.
Utilizing the vector identity2,8

where S is the surface of V, the average of the electric ﬁeld over V centered at 0 can be written as4

Eq. (7) implies the average E is determined completely by the potential on the surface S.

We now use a well-known result from the method of images solution for the potential of a point charge next to a
conducting sphere: the potential on the surface S for a charge q at r inside the sphere is reproduced exactly by an
image charge q′ = Rq/d at r′ = (R2/r) ˆr outside the sphere (ˆr is a unit vector). Eq. (7) therefore implies that the E
for a point charge q at r is exactly equal to that of an image point charge q′ at (R2/r) ˆr. But since the image charge
is outside the sphere, we can use property 1 to determine E,

E = Eimage(0) = −

(8)

where p = qr is the dipole moment for a single point charge.

Generalization to continuous charge distributions – Assume the charge distribution inside the spherical volume V is
ρ(r). A volume element dV at r inside V contains charge dq = ρ(r) dV . The image charge element outside the sphere
which gives the same average electric ﬁeld as dq is dq′ = ρ′(r′) dV ′ = dq R/r at r′ = (R2/r) ˆr. As in the discrete case,
the contribution of dq to the average E-ﬁeld in V is equal to the electric ﬁeld at the origin due to dq′,

dE = dEimage(0) = −

ρ′(r′) dV ′
4πǫ0r′2 ˆr = −

The averaged electric ﬁeld due to all charges in the sphere V is therefore

where p = RV dV r ρ(r) is the dipole moment with respect to the origin of all the charges in V.

3. Magnetic ﬁeld with sources outside the sphere

(9)

(10)

When magnetic ﬁeld sources are absent in V, both ∇ · B = 0 and ∇ × B = 0, and hence B = −∇φM where
∇2φM = 0 inside the sphere. Therefore, the same derivation for property 1 holds here; that is, the average of the
B-ﬁeld over a sphere is equal to its value at the center of the sphere.

4. Magnetic ﬁeld for sources inside the sphere –

Using the vector potential description of the magnetic ﬁeld, B = ∇ × A, the average over the sphere V can be

written as4

B =

3

4πR3 ZV

∇ × A = −

3

4πR3 IS

A × da.

(11)

The second equality in the above equation is a vector identity.8 This equation shows that, as in the case of the E-ﬁeld
and the scalar potential, the average B-ﬁeld over any volume V can be computed from A on the surface of V.

We now consider the contribution to B of current element J(r) dV inside V. We can do this by determining the
image current element outside the sphere that exactly reproduces the vector potential due to J(r) dV on the surface
of the sphere. We choose the Coulomb gauge

Ai(r) =

4π Z Ji(x)

dx,

(12)

where i denotes spatial component. Since Ai is related to Ji in the same way as the electric potential Φ is to the
charge density ρ, the method of electrostatic images can also be used here to determine the image current element.

The proof of property 4 proceeds analogously to that of property 2. For J(r) dV inside the sphere V, A on the
surface S is reproduced by an image current element J′(r′) dV ′ = (R/r)J(r) dV , where r′ = (R2/r)ˆr. Since the image
current is outside the sphere, we can use property 3. Thus, the J(r) dV contribution to the average B-ﬁeld in V is
equal to the B-ﬁeld at the center due to J′(r′) dV ′,9

(13)

(14)

where m = 1

2 RV dV r × J(r) is magnetic moment of a current distribution in V.

Finally, note that similar arguments hold for charge distributions which are constant along the z-direction, since
the potentials for these satisfy Laplace’s equation in two dimensions, and the method of images is also applicable for
line charges.

9 The fact that ∇′ · J′(r′) may be non-zero is irrelevant, because we know from Jeﬁmenko’s equations (see Ref. 1, pg. 427–429;

can be ignored by assuming that the currents were turned on inﬁnitely long ago. See also Ref. 1, Problem 7.55, pg. 339.

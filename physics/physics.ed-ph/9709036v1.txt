Abstract. We present a simple analytic scheme for calculating the binding energy of excitons
in semiconductors that takes full account of the existing anisotropy in the eﬀective mass, as a
complement to the qualitative treatment in most textbooks. Results obtained for excitons in gallium
nitride form the basis for a discussion of the accuracy of this approach.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. VARIATIONAL EXCITON WAVEFUNCTION

The traditional one-particle theory of semiconductors
as taught in undergraduate courses is that of a mate-
rial with a ﬁnite energy gap separating the highest occu-
pied from the lowest unoccupied electronic state. In this
picture the minimum energy for an elementary excita-
tion is that required to raise a valence band electron into
the conduction band, and is thus equal to the gap Eg.
However, the electron and the hole, which is created in
the same process, need not separate completely and can
instead form a bound pair under the inﬂuence of their
mutual Coulomb attraction [1]. Such bound electron-
hole pairs, which transport energy and momentum but
no charge, are called excitons. They are, in fact, the
truly lowest elementary excitations of a pure semicon-
ductor and their inﬂuence on the optical properties of a
material is profound. Most importantly, the occurrence
of excitons lowers the threshold for photon absorption to
Eb, where Eb denotes the internal binding energy
Eg
of the electron-hole pair.

Because of their practical signiﬁcance excitons feature
in all textbooks on solid state physics, but the discus-
sion is usually restricted to some qualitative arguments
based on formal similarities to the hydrogen atom prob-
lem, which is modiﬁed only by a dielectric constant to
account for the surrounding medium and by empirical
eﬀective masses for the electron and hole [2]. The latter
are always assumed to be isotropic, but while there cer-
tainly are textbook examples such as CdS for which this
condition is nearly satisﬁed and hydrogenic absorption
series have indeed been observed [3], in most semiconduc-
tors the anisotropy in the eﬀective mass is so large that
it cannot be ignored in a quantitative treatment. In this
paper we present a variational scheme for calculating the
binding energy Eb of excitons in realistic materials that
takes full account of the existing anisotropy. Our priority
has been to maintain a universally applicable and strictly
analytic approach suitable for teaching purposes.

Most semiconductors used for modern electronic de-
vices crystallize in the diamond (e.g. Si, Ge), zincblende
(e.g. GaAs) or wurtzite (e.g. GaN) structure, for which
the constant energy surfaces E(k) about the valence band
maximum and conduction band minimum are ellipsoidal
in shape, yielding distinct longitudinal electron and hole
eﬀective masses me
k along one principal axis, and
transverse eﬀective masses me
⊥ in the plane per-
pendicular to it. Here we will focus on this geometry,
although the method is readily generalized. Taking the
principal axis in the z-direction, the Hamiltonian for the
relative motion of the electron-hole pair is

the hydrogen Hamiltonian, yielding a wavefunction with
a diﬀerent characteristic localization along the principal
axis and in the transverse plane. We therefore choose a
generalization of the hydrogen ground-state wavefunction
with ellipsoidal symmetry

where the two parameters β and λ can be varied indepen-
dently to control the transverse and longitudinal exten-
sion. The wavefunction, of course, becomes exact in the
isotropic case µk = µ⊥ with λ = 1 and β−1 = a0ǫm/µ⊥,
where a0 = 0.529 ˚A denotes the Bohr radius and m is the
free electron mass, but it remains an excellent approxima-
tion even when the anisotropy is large. A wavefunction

shallow donor impurity states in Si and Ge, but treated
numerically and evaluated only for the mathematically
distinct case λ < 1, reﬂecting the fact that the longitudi-
nal eﬀective mass is greater than the transverse one for
electrons at the bottom of the conduction band in both
materials. No such restriction will be made in this paper.
Given the explicit form of the wavefunction (2) the
calculation of the kinetic energy is straightforward, using
the substitution z′ = z/λ and a subsequent transforma-
tion to spherical coordinates. We obtain

which may be solved graphically. The important point
to note is that the right-hand side of (10) is a univer-
sal function f (λ) that does not depend on the material
properties, so the same plot can be used for all semicon-
ductors to determine λ. In practice, however, the reduced
transverse and longitudinal eﬀective mass will often not
diﬀer by more than a factor of three and in this value
range the function on the right-hand side of (10) is accu-
rately approximated by its lowest-order polynomial term

β deﬁned through the relation (8).

In order to illustrate the numerical quality of our
scheme, we now consider the case of gallium nitride as
an explicit example for excitonic binding energies in a
realistic semiconductor. In GaN the valence band maxi-
mum comprises three almost degenerate subbands, giving
rise to three distinct hole types that can partake in the
formation of excitons. Conventionally, these are referred
to as light holes, heavy holes and split-oﬀ holes, reﬂecting
their diﬀerent eﬀective masses. Within the same material
we can study excitons for which the reduced longitudinal

eﬀective mass is greater than the transverse as well as
excitons for which it is smaller, and test the accuracy of
the approximate treatment in either case.

The eﬀective mass of the electron at the bottom of
the conduction band is me
⊥ = 0.18 in the transverse and
me
k = 0.20 in the longitudinal direction, given in units of
the free electron mass m, while corresponding parameters
for the three hole types are listed in table I. All values are
quoted from [5]. Next the calculated anisotropy factors
µ⊥/µk are given. For excitons formed with heavy holes
this is close to unity, indicating a rather small pertur-
bation from the isotropic case, but the ratio is substan-
tially smaller with light holes and larger with split-oﬀ
holes, respectively. The ﬁfth column in table I lists the
binding energies Eb obtained analytically from (9) with
λ = (µ⊥/µk)1/3. These are compared with results that
we obtained by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian
(1) using standard numerical techniques. The applicable
value of the static dielectric constant is the low-frequency
limit ǫ = 9.5 of GaN.

The excellent agreement between the approximate and
numerical results in all cases conﬁrms the validity of the
variational wavefunction (2) as well as the accuracy of the
additional simpliﬁcation (11) that makes the approach
strictly analytic. Comparison with experimental data is
more problematic because it is very diﬃcult to extract
accurate binding energies from optical spectra. Never-
theless, the recently published values of 21 meV for exci-
tons with light and heavy holes and 23 meV for excitons
with split-oﬀ holes in GaN are probably quite reliable
[6]. The discrepancy with the results obtained here is
due to the underlying model Hamiltonian (1), however,
not the analytic approximations introduced to solve it.
While the anisotropy in the eﬀective mass is treated ad-
equately, other important features such as the mixing
of states at the threefold degenerate valence band max-
imum or the spatial variation of the dielectric function
are still neglected. A more involved quantitative scheme
will also have to incorporate these in order to reproduce
experimental binding energies for real materials.

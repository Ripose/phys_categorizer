Abstract
We study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a chiral ﬂuid, where the molecules
are described by a simpliﬁed version of the Kuhn coupled oscillator model. The eigenmodes
of Maxwell’s equations are circularly polarized waves. The application of a static magnetic
ﬁeld further leads to a magnetochiral term in the index of refraction of the ﬂuid, which is
independent of the wave polarization. A similar result holds when absorption is taken into
account. Interference experiments and photochemical reactions have recently demonstrated
the existence of the magnetochiral term. The comparison with Faraday rotation in an achiral
ﬂuid emphasizes the diﬀerent symmetry properties of the two eﬀects.

I. INTRODUCTION

In simple ﬂuids, the propagation of an electromagnetic wave is usually treated as fol-
lows. Sticking to a classical description, one considers that the bound electrons of the ﬂuid
molecules are displaced from their equilibrium positions by the Lorentz force of the wave-
ﬁeld. This (time dependent) displacement or induced electric dipole can be modelled as a
current density~j(~r, t) which is related to the electromagnetic ﬁeld ~E(~r, t) and ~B(~r, t) through
Newton’s force equation (Complications such as local ﬁelds eﬀects will not be considered in
this paper). Neglecting the magnetic contribution (the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom
| ∼ | ~v×~B
leads to an estimate | Fmagn
c < 10−2), and using Maxwell’s equations then leads
~E
Felec
to textbook expressions for the index of refraction of the ﬂuid [1]

| ∼ v

For chiral molecules, one has to consider the displacement of the bound electrons on a
well deﬁned geometric structure. In other words, one has to take into account the variation of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld down to molecular distances. The induced electric dipole moment
(or current density) depends now on the ﬁeld and on its spatial derivatives. This may be
the reason why the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a chiral ﬂuid is not frequently
treated at an undergraduate level [2].

On the other hand, students may encounter phenomenological models which show that
Maxwell’s equations in an isotropic chiral ﬂuid have circularly polarized waves as eigenmodes
[3–5]. This in turn suggests a comparison with the Faraday eﬀect [6], which deals with the
propagation of waves in an simple (achiral) ﬂuid in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The
comparison of these two situations raises questions about parity and time reversal transfor-
mations in a “non particle physics” context [7–10]. These symmetry considerations are not
conﬁned to theory: recent experiments [11–13] have shown that the interplay of chirality and
magnetism have remarkable consequences, that have been observed in interference experi-
ments and in photochemical reactions. Roughly speaking, the application of a magnetic ﬁeld
on a chiral ﬂuid leads to a change in the index of refraction, and this new “magnetochiral”
term is independent of the state of polarization of the wave. The order of magnitude of this
term is rather small (see below), but its possible implications for the origin of terrestrial
homochirality in biomolecules (DNA, proteins,...) are rather interesting [14].

The present paper does not claim to be original. Its merit is perhaps to bring to the
attention of students some topics which are somehow scattered through the litterature.
Furthermore, experiments which are both “hot” and accessible to undergraduates are not
so frequent.

To illustrate these considerations in a self contained way, section II will present polariza-
tion conventions and notations, as well as some deﬁnitions pertaining to chirality. Section
III presents a sketchy derivation of the Faraday eﬀect in a simple (achiral) ﬂuid.
In the
framework of the elastically bound electron model, this model yields reasonable orders of
magnitude, and enables one to study various aspects of the Faraday eﬀet (dependence on
the direction of propagation of light with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld, reﬂection on a con-
ducting mirror). The introduction of a damping term in the electron’s equation of motion
can then model absorption phenomena.

In section IV, we consider a model of chiral molecules, which consists of two coupled
anisotropic oscillators [15,16]. By further restricting the accessible orientations (albeit in an
isotropic way), we will derive to lowest order the inﬂuence of chirality on Maxwell’s equations

3

and show explicitly that the eigenmodes are circularly polarized waves. The diﬀerences with
the Faraday eﬀect will be pointed out, in particular from the symmetry point of view.

In section V, we consider the eﬀect of a magnetic ﬁeld on a chiral ﬂuid, along the lines
of Larmor’s theorem. This non-rigorous point of view [10] suggests the existence of a new
(symmetry allowed) term in the index of refraction, called the magnetochiral term.
Its
order of magnitude is obtained through the model of section IV, and we discuss a recent
interference experiment where this term is involved. Finally, when absorption is taken
into account, the magnetochiral contribution leads to remarkable results in photochemical
reactions.

II. DEFINITIONS AND NOTATIONS

Two molecules are superposable if one can bring them into coincidence by using only
translations and rotations. A molecule (L) is chiral if it is non-superposable onto its mirror
image (D). The (L) and (D) forms of a molecule are called enantiomers of this molecule.
A ﬂuid made of equal amounts of both enantiomers is called racemic. A ﬂuid made only of
(L) (resp. (D) ) molecules will be called a (L)-ﬂuid (resp. a (D)-ﬂuid) in this paper.
In agreement with many authors [16–19], we consider a wave to be right (resp.

left)
circularly polarized wave if an observer looking towards the source sees at a ﬁxed point in
space, the tip of the electric ﬁeld turn clockwise (resp. anticlockwise) with time.

Physical properties pertaining to a right (resp.

left) circularly polarized wave will be
denoted by the subscript + (resp. -). A subscript L (resp. D) will be further added if one
deals with a (L)-ﬂuid (resp. (D)-ﬂuid). So nL
+(ω) denotes the index of refraction of a right
circularly polarized wave of frequency ω in the (L)-ﬂuid.

III. THE FARADAY EFFECT

A. The elastically bound electron model

We consider a monochromatic plane wave, of frequency ω, propagating in a simple (achi-
ral) ﬂuid. The direction of propagation is the z > 0 direction. We model the atoms as
hydrogen atoms, where the bound electrons are submitted to an elastic force ~f = −meω2
0~r,
where me is the electron mass, ω0 a typical electronic frequency (ω0 ∼ 1015 Hz), and ~r is
measured from the equilibrium position of the electron. Neglecting the magnetic force, we
get

If N is the particle density, the induced electric dipole moment per unit volume then reads

B. Eﬀect of a magnetic ﬁeld and circular polarizations

We speciﬁcally consider the propagation of a right circularly polarized wave (~E+ =
E0(cos(kz − ωt), sin(kz − ωt), 0)) in the presence of a static magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 = B0~ez. The
equation of motion

¨~r = −meω2

shows that the Lorentz force due to B0 is antiparallel to the elastic force. Following the
same steps as before gives

C. Faraday rotation

since in this case, the Lorentz force due to B0 is parallel to the elastic force.

Let us now consider a linearly polarized wave propagating in a conﬁned ﬂuid (0 < z < l),
in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 = B0~ez. Since a linearly polarized wave can be
decomposed into two circularly polarized waves (+) and (−) of equal amplitude but with
diﬀerent phase velocities (v± = c/n±(ω, B0)), elementary calculations show that the direction
of vibration of the electric ﬁeld rotates between z = 0 and z = l by an amount α, with

where ∆n(ω, B0) = n+(ω, B0) − n−(ω, B0). This rotation is counterclockwise for an observer
looking towards the source since v+ < v− as shown by equations (6,7). (Note that this
simple model applies only to diamagnetic materials; paramagnetic materials require a more
sophisticated treatment).

Equations (6,7) also show that, as long as one deals with frequencies ω ≫ ωL = eB0
2me

, one

has

up to O( ωL
ω )2 terms. Since ω ∼ ω0 ∼ 1015 Hz and even for B0 = 10 T, we only have
ωL ∼ 1012 Hz, we will consider that Larmor theorem, as expressed by equation (9), holds.
This allows us to rewrite the magnetic birefringence as

n±(ω, B0) ≃ n(ω ± ωL)

∆n(ω, B0) ≃

eB0
me

dn(ω)
dω

Typical orders of magnitude for a liquid such as CS2 are ∆n(ω, B0) ∼ 10−5 for B0 = 1 T.
The observation of the Faraday birefringence in an interference experiment is relatively easy
since the Rayleigh and Michelson interferometers may detect index variations down to 10−8
[21].

The above expressions pertain to a wave propagating parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld ~B0.

For propagation in direction ~u (with ~u = ~k

k ), equations (9,10) read

as can be checked for a wave propagating in the z < 0 direction ( ~B0 · ~u < 0).

The eﬀect of placing a perfectly conducting mirror at z = l in the original experiment
(where the incident wave has ~u = ~ez) can be analyzed from diﬀerent points of view. The
simplest one is probably described in [9]: for an observer receiving the reﬂected wave, the
incident wave from z = 0 to z = l is equivalent, in the (symmetric w.r.t the mirror) image
space, to a wave propagating in the z < 0 direction in the same magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 = B0~ez (this
is a clear illustration of the axial character of the magnetic ﬁeld ~B0, since ~B0 is perpendicular
to the mirror). Taking into account the reﬂected wave, shows that Faraday’s rotation is
doubled for this observer (the reﬂection on the mirror is irrelevant since it changes the
sense, but not the direction of the electric ﬁeld). Typical orders of magnitude for a liquid
such as CS2 are α ≃ 0.2 − 0.3 rd, for l = 10−2 m and ∆n(ω, B0) ∼ 10−5.

Finally, the inclusion of damping in equations (1,5) leads to an absorption of the wave
by the ﬂuid. Denoting by n2 the imaginary part of the index of refraction, we clearly
have n2+(ω, B0) 6= n2−(ω, B0). This magnetic dichroism implies an elliptical polarization
(together with a Faraday rotation of the major axis of the ellipse) in the above experiments.
Typical orders of magnitude are ∆n2(ω,B0)

n2(ω) ∼ 10−4 − 10−5 for B0 = 1 T.

IV. PROPAGATION IN A CHIRAL FLUID

A. The simpliﬁed Kuhn model

As previously mentionned, to take chirality into account requires a rather detailed geo-
metric description of the ﬂuid molecules. We consider here the simplest model of a chiral
molecule [15,16], which consists of two coupled oscillators.

To ﬁx notations, we consider a ﬁxed trihedron (Oxyz), with unit vectors (~ex, ~ey, ~ez),
and a (L)-ﬂuid with N molecules per unit volume. Each molecule has two electrons, whose
equilibrium positions are called ~R0
1| the size of the
12 = ~R0
molecule. We also deﬁne ~R0

2. We denote by d = | ~R0

2 − ~R0

12 and ~R0 =

1 = d ~b0

2 − ~R0

~R0

.

1+ ~R0

Due to their interaction with the propagating wave, the electrons are displaced from ~R0
1

(resp. ~R0

2) by an amount ~r1 (resp. ~r2).

For a ﬁxed orientation of the molecule (i.e.
Kuhn model are both one dimensional and coupled:

for a ﬁxed ~b0

12) , the displacements of the

(i) the unit vector in the direction of ~r1 (resp. ~r2) is denoted by ~b1 (resp. ~b2). The

chirality stems from the fact that the unit vectors ~b1, ~b2 et ~b0

12 are such that

(15)

χ = ~b0

2) + meΩ2

12(~b1 · ~r1)(~b2 · ~r2)

where ω0 and Ω12 are electronic frequencies.

Compared to the original Kuhn model, we further add two restrictions [16]:
(iii) With respect to the ﬁxed (Oxyz) trihedron, each molecule of the ﬂuid can only

adopt the six orientations (Ai, i = 1, 2, ..., 6) shown in Figure 1.

The geometrical parameters of (Ai) are denoted with an index (i): we thus have
2 , ~r(i)

2 , ...... The chirality is clearly the same for all orientations

χ(i) =

12 · (~b(i)

2 ) = χ = −1.

(iv) We assume that the orientations (Ai) are equiprobable.

These restrictions preserve the isotropy of the ﬂuid, and make the calculations easier

(more complete calculations can be found in ref [16]).

B. Equations of motion

Neglecting the magnetic contribution to the Lorentz force, we get

and

Projecting on ~b1 and ~b2, and looking for forced solutions, we obtain for orientation (Ai)

where the orientation independent matrix M is given by

and M−1 is its inverse.
Let us consider for the time being a linearly polarized wave, with ~E = Re(E(z) e−jωt)~ex.
The resolution of the equations for each (equiprobable) orientation yields the induced electric
dipole moment ~P of the ﬂuid. It will turn out that ~P has components both parallel (~P//)
and perpendicular (~P⊥) to the ﬁeld ~E. It is easily seen that orientations (A5, A6) do not
contribute to ~P, and that orientations (A3, A4) only contribute to ~P//. On the other hand,
orientations (A1, A2) contribute to both components. Elementary algebra show that

where we have used equation (13). Equation (23) explicitly shows that γL(ω) is a pseudo

Several points can easily be checked on equations (24,25)

(i) the index of refraction is the same for a (e.g. right) circularly polarized wave propa-

gating in the (L)-ﬂuid, in the z > 0 and z < 0 directions.

(ii) for the (D)-ﬂuid, one has nD

±(ω) = nL

∓(ω), since γL(ω) = −γD(ω).

(iii) if a linearly polarized wave propagates in a (L)-ﬂuid, conﬁned between z = 0 and

z = l, the direction of vibration of the electric ﬁeld will rotate by an angle β given by

β =

∆nL(ω) =

2ε0

In our model of a (L)-ﬂuid, the rotation is counterclockwise, and a typical order of magnitude
is β ∼ 1.5 rd for l ∼ 10−2 m.

(iv) if one places a perfectly conducting plane at z = l, we again follow [9]:

for an
observer receiving the reﬂected wave, the incident wave is equivalent to a wave propagating
in the (symmmetric w.r.t the mirror) image space in the z < 0 direction.
In the image
space, the image of the (L)-ﬂuid is the (D)-ﬂuid (again a clear illustration of the pseudo-
scalar character of chirality). The full experiment for this observer amounts to a propagation
in the z < 0 direction, ﬁrst through the (D)-ﬂuid (incident wave), and then through the
(L)-ﬂuid (reﬂected wave), leading to a cancellation of the angle of rotation. Once again,
the reﬂection on the mirror is irrelevant since it changes the sense, but not the direction of
the electric ﬁeld. This cancellation contrasts with the Faraday result and emphasizes the
symmetry diﬀerences between the two cases [2,8,9]

Finally, absorption of the wave can be modelled through damping terms in equations
(16,17). Detailed calculations can be found in [16]. We only stress here that the symmmetry
properties of the real and imaginary parts of the index of refraction are very similar. In
particular, we have nL

2−(ω) (natural dichroism) and nD

2±(ω) = nL

V. EFFECT OF A MAGNETIC FIELD: THE MAGNETOCHIRAL EFFECT

In principle, it is possible to study analytically the eﬀect of a static magnetic ~B0 on equa-
tions (16,17). It is much quicker, following [10] to apply Larmor theorem (11) to equation
(25) and to write

(~k0 · ~B0)

(28)

where ~k0 = k0~u = ω
c ~u. Note that the Larmor frequency shift has not be done on the “k0”
term of equation (25). This seems plausible since the magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 will act only on
the coupled oscillators, that is on γ(ω); the “k0” term on the other hand, comes from the
operator “curl” in equation (21) which is not aﬀected by the dynamics. We refer the reader
to reference [10] for further discussions on this point.

The remarkable prediction of equation (28) is that the last term, called the magnetochiral
term, does not depend on the polarization of the wave. It exists for linearly polarized or
non polarized light, and has several interesting consequences:

(i) magnetochiral birefringence: a (L)-ﬂuid in a magnetic ﬁeld and the associate (D)-ﬂuid
in the same magnetic ﬁeld do not have the same index of refraction for waves propagating
parallel to the ﬁeld, regardless of the polarization of the waves (one may also say that a (L)-
ﬂuid in a magnetic ﬁeld does not have the same index of refraction for waves propagating
parallel or antiparallel to the ﬁeld).

(ii) magnetochiral dichroism: the introduction of damping in the Kuhn model shows that
the absorption coeﬃcient of a (L)-ﬂuid in a magnetic ﬁeld is not the same as the absorption
coeﬃcient of a (D)-ﬂuid, regardless of the polarization of the wave (one may also say that a
(L)-ﬂuid in a magnetic ﬁeld does not absorb in the same way waves propagating parallel or
antiparallel to the ﬁeld).

(iii) these magnetochiral eﬀects vanish if light propagates perpendicularly to the ﬁeld.
(iv) For the mirror experiment described in section IV C, (iv), in the presence of a
magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 = B0~ez, the contributions of the magnetochiral term cancel. The argument
is the same as for the chiral contributions.

From the Kuhn model, one may get an order of magnitude for the magnetochiral term
of equation (28): setting d = 10˚A, N = 5 1026m−3, ω = Ω12 = ω0
2 = π 1015 Hz and B0 = 10
T, and using equation (23), we ﬁnd a contribution to the index of refraction of order 10−8,
quite close to the experimental limits [21]. One may further argue that this is precisely
the order of magnitude of the terms which have been neglected in Larmor “theorem”(see
equation (9)). So, one has ﬁnally to turn to experiments, which indeed have demonstrated
the existence of the magnetochiral term(s).

10

A. Magnetochiral birefringence: an interference experiment

Imagine a Young double slit experiment with linearly polarized light, and let Oz be the

optical axis of the set-up. After slit S1, one adds:

• a vessel C1 containing the (L)-ﬂuid in a magnetic ﬁeld ~B0 = B0~ez followed by

• another vessel C1 containing the associate (D)-ﬂuid in the opposite magnetic ﬁeld

(− ~B0).

One adds after slit S2:

• a vessel C2 containing the associate (D)-ﬂuid in a ﬁeld ~B0, followed by

• another vessel C2 containing the (L)-ﬂuid in the opposite magnetic ﬁeld (− ~B0).

The vessels are identical. Analyzing this experiment with equation (28) shows that
the phase shift of the interference pattern caused by the enantiomers is entirely due to
the magnetochiral term. All other contributions cancel, whereas the magnetochiral term is
multiplied by four. The experiment has actually been done with a Michelson interferometer
in a slightly modiﬁed way [12].

B. Magnetochiral dichroism: a photochemical reaction

Discriminating enantiomers is a major problem in chemistry. A classical experiment is
the following (see [24,25] and references therein). One considers an initially racemic solution,
that one illuminates with right circularly polarized light. The absorption of light gives rise
to chemical reactions (D → L) and (L → D) [26]. In a certain range of parameters, these
reactions are ﬁrst order and we denote by k1 and k2 their respective rates. Experimentally,
one ﬁnds k1 = KI0nD
2+(ω) where K is a constant and I0 the intensity
of the light. The concentrations of the enantiomers [L] and [D] are given by

so that the least absorbing enantiomer is in excess.

This experiment has recently been done with natural (unpolarized) light, in the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the direction of propagation of light [13]: the magnetochiral
eﬀect implies that the absorption is not the same for the enantiomers, leading again to a non
racemic solution at equilibrium. The experiment of [13], achieves a value y ≃ 10−4, with a
magnetic ﬁeld B0 = 10 T.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have presented in a simple way old theoretical models and recent experiments, on
“chirality, light and magnetism” [27–30]. These topics can be of interest for undergraduate
students, either from a physical or a (bio)chemical point of view, the more so since they
also show up in other ﬁelds [31–34]. At a more advanced level, local ﬁeld eﬀects as well as
quantum calculations can be introduced [35,36].

It is a pleasure to thank J-J. Girerd for discussions.

Figure 1: The allowed orientations (Ai) for a chiral molecule in the restricted Kuhn
model. The displacement of the electrons are along ~b1 and ~b2. We consider a linearly
polarized wave propagating along the z axis, with ~E = Re(E(z) e−jωt)~ex, see text.
In
orientations (A1) and (A2), where ~b0
12 = ~ez, the electric ﬁeld is not the same on the two
electrons, leading to a non zero contribution to ~P⊥, see equation (19). In orientations (A3)
and (A4), where ~b0
12 = ~ey, the electric ﬁeld is the same on the two electrons, leading to a
contribution to ~P//. In orientations (A5) and (A6), where ~b0
12 = ~ex, the electrons are not
coupled to the electric ﬁeld since (~E · ~b1 = ~E · ~b2 = 0).

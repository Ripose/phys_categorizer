A trip to the end of the universe and the twin “paradox”

In principle, the twin paradox oﬀers the possibility to go on a trip to the center of our galaxy
or even to the end of our universe within life time. In order to be a most comfortable journey the
voyaging twin accelerates with Earth’s gravity. We developed some Java applets to visualize what
both twins could really measure, namely time signals and light coming from the surrounding sky.

I.

INTRODUCTION

We take the view that the twin paradox is well under-
stood and we won’t loose time explaining it once more.
For a detailed discussion of this topic we refer the reader
to standard literature. The crucial detail in the twin
paradox is the fact that there is an asymmetry between
both twins. Accepting this makes the word “paradox”
meaningless.

It is the purpose of this article to emphasize the local
perspective of each twin who could only do measurements
with respect to their individual reference frames. This re-
sembles Bondi’s k-calculus1 or the concept of radar time
as discussed by Dolby and Gull2 where hypersurfaces of
simultaneity are deﬁned by local measurements of re-
ﬂected light signals. The interesting information both
twins can interchange in our example are their individ-
ual proper time. But they will not be able to determine
the time dilation out of that because the information car-
rying the proper time of the other twin needs some time
to travel the distance between them. This time inter-
change, as the motion itself, is not symmetric. Besides
the time signals, both twins also receive light from dis-
tant stars or other astronomical sources. Depending on
the relative velocity with respect to the light source, each
twin will have a diﬀerent view of the stellar sky because
of aberration and Doppler shift.

It is a well known fact that acceleration is not the cru-
cial basis to explain the twin paradox. Only the diﬀerence
in length of their paths make the twins age at diﬀerent
rates. But for a complete journey the traveling twin has
to leave Earth with a rocket starting with zero velocity.
Having reached his destination the twin might return to
Earth — if Earth still exists. In order to be a most com-
fortable journey we consider a uniformly accelerated mo-
tion which is separated into four phases of equal period.
Even though acceleration is usually brought into connec-
tion with general relativity3,4 it can also be treated only
in special relativity5.

We expect the reader to be familiar with basic calcula-
tions like the Lorentz transformations and the description
of acceleration within special relativity. In Sec. II we re-
view the description of uniformly accelerated motion in
special relativity. Following the example of Ruder6 we

present a special round trip consisting of four equal ac-
celeration phases in Sec. III. From a local perspective
taken in Sec. IV only time or light signals can be mea-
sured by each twin. As an example, we consider a ﬂight
to Vega and examine the time signal exchange in Sec. V.
In Sec. VI we derive the frequency shift and aberration
formulas for the following visualization of the stellar sky.
In Sec. VII we describe the visual eﬀects due to aber-
ration and frequency shift. In the last section we show
how far we can travel with the help of time dilation and
length contraction.

II. UNIFORM ACCELERATION

The earth twin Eric stays in the inertial reference frame
S, whereas his traveling twin sister Tina leaves the Earth
with constant acceleration α with respect to her own in-
stantaneous system S′. Please note that all primed quan-
tities refer to S′, and unprimed quantities to S. From
the Newtonian point of view, Tina will reach a velocity
v = α∆t within the time ∆t. She will then have cov-
ered a distance ∆x = 1
2 α∆t2. Both twins will agree on
time, velocity and distance. For velocities much smaller
than the speed of light, v
c, this will be still correct.

III. A SPECIFIC ROUND TRIP

The situation we want to examine is the following.
While Eric stays at home, Tina goes on a journey that is
separated into four phases which last the time T ′ each.
In the ﬁrst phase she starts at point (cid:192)
and accelerates
with α until she reaches the maximum velocity

vmax = c tanh

(10)

at point ` , compare Fig. 1. Next, she decelerates with
α until she stops at her destination ´ where she has

The same procedure, but now in the opposite direction,
brings Tina back to home. Thus, the hole trip takes 4T ′
with respect to Tina’s proper time, whereas Eric has to
wait the time

αT ′

4T = 4

for his sister’s return. Hence, the bigger the acceleration
is and the longer the journey lasts, the bigger is the eﬀect
of time dilation and the diﬀerent aging of both twins.
Tina’s worldline is shown in a spacetime diagram (Fig. 1),
where the proper time ct of Eric is plotted over Tina’s
distance x to Eric.

point ` and slows down until she reaches the turning point

down again until she comes home.

IV. OBSERVATION OF TIME SIGNALS

In contrast to normal discussions of special relativ-
ity concerning length contraction or time dilation with
a group of synchronized observers, we concentrate on a
local perspective. Hence, we can only use light signals
exchanged by both twins to determine the proper time
in each case. For this, the signals are coded with the
proper emission time temit or t′
emit which will be received
by the other twin at observation time t′
obs or tobs. Of
course, this measured time is not the actual time of the
other twin. Because of the ﬁnite speed of light the sig-
nals need some time to travel the distance between both
twins.

Eric’s perspective: Eric observes at his proper time tobs
a signal send from Tina. Because of the ﬁnite speed of
light the signal must have been emitted at earth time
temit,

tobs = temit +

x (temit)
c

.

(13)

The diﬀerence between tobs and temit is exactly the time
needed for the signal to travel from Tina’s current posi-
tion xemit = x (temit) to the Earth. In order to determine
the exact position xemit we have to ﬁnd out the period of
acceleration when Tina has emitted the signal (compare
Fig. 2).

The border points ti, (i = 2, . . . , 4), of the intervals
follow from conditions like t2 = t` + x` /c, whereas t5

Tina’s perspective: Now, we consider the opposite sit-

Tina’s world line,

tobs = temit +

.

(23)

In contrast to Eric’s perspective the calculations are a lit-
tle bit more straight forward because we determine temit
out of t′

obs transforms into tobs via Eq.(7).

V. FLIGHT TO VEGA

As a ﬁrst example we consider a ﬂight to our neigh-
boring star Vega, which is roughly 25.3 ly away16.
In
order to be a most comfortable journey Tina accelerates
9.81 m/s2. While the journey takes
with α = 1g
≈
T ′
total = 4T ′
12.93 years with respect to her proper
≈
54.48 years for his sister.
time, Eric has to wait Ttotal ≈
The worldline of Tina with respect to Eric’s rest frame
is shown in the spacetime diagram, Fig. 3. Even though
Tina follows an accelerated motion, her worldline looks
to be almost linear.

Because of the moderate acceleration Tina’s rocket
needs roughly one year to get 80% of the speed of light.
she reaches maximum speed βmax ≈
At position x`
0.9975, compare Fig. 4.
Now, let’s consider the exchange of time signals be-
tween both twins. Proper time sent by the one twin and
received by the other is plotted in a time-time-diagram,
compare Fig. 5 and Fig. 7. The proper time of the twin
who receives a signal is plotted on the abscissa whereas
the proper time, which was sent by the other twin, is
shown on the ordinate. The shape of the curves are hard
to understand because two eﬀects are mixed, time dila-
tion and nonlinear change of distance. In order to explain
the diﬀerences between these curves, we also plotted the
space-time diagram with Tina’s worldline. The time sig-
nals are represented by straight lines with 45◦ slope, com-
pare Fig. 6 and Fig. 8. Note that time intervals along
Tina’s worldline are not equally spaced because of her
accelerated motion.

Eric’s perspective (Fig. 5 and 6): While Eric stays at
home, Tina leaves Earth with proper acceleration α. Be-
cause the distance between both twins grows, it’s quite
obvious that signals emitted by Tina need more and more
time to reach Eric. Additionally, because of time dilation,
Tina seems to wait a longer time than expected before
emitting the next signal. Even though Tina is already on
the way back to home when she has left her destination
´, Eric will collect most of her time signals only in the
very end of her journey.

Tina’s perspective (Fig. 7 and 8): It might be obvi-
ous that Tina’s perspective is a little bit diﬀerent. Eric’s
“ﬁrst year” signal reaches Tina not until she already de-
celerates to her destination ´. On her way home, Tina
seems to receive the signals quite regularly but because of
time dilation she collects most of the signals around point
ˆ when she has maximum speed and the time dilation
eﬀect is strongest.

In order to investigate this situation for diﬀerent
proper accelerations α and diﬀerent periods of time T ′,
we have written an interactive Java applet (App. A).

VI. THE ACCELERATED REFERENCE FRAME

A. Aberration, Doppler shift and length
contraction

In four-dimensional spacetime any observer has their
own local reference system which is given by four base
vectors. Each measurement is taken with respect to this
local tetrad.

Consider the ﬂat Minkowski spacetime which is repre-

sented by the metric

ds2 =

c2dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2.

From Eq. (32) follows that Tina will see objects to be
blueshifted for z < 0 and redshifted for z > 0.

A similar consideration leads to length contraction. A
ﬁxed distance l′ to some point in the direction (ϑ′, ϕ′)
with respect to Tina’s current frame would have a length

B. Apparent size of an object

In case of accelerated motion, objects in the direction
of motion always seem to recede in the ﬁrst moments
even though one is approaching. The reason for this is
also based on the aberration eﬀect. Consider an object
a distance d apart with apex angle ξ0 as seen from the
origin x = 0, Fig. 10.

apex angle ξ(t′) with

The acceleration α in Eq. (36) decides whether Tina ap-
proaches (α > 0) the object or recedes (α < 0). From the
aberration formula (33b) follows the apex angle ξ′(t′) of
the object with respect to Tina,

Thus, accelerating from zero velocity in the direction to
the object (α > 0) has the eﬀect, that this object appears
to shrink in the ﬁrst moment giving the impression to
recede from it instead of approaching. This impression
holds until dξ′/dt′ = 0,

An acceleration into the opposite direction results in a
magniﬁcation which has its maximum at time t′
n. Even
though a velocity close to the speed of light has a tremen-
dous magniﬁcation eﬀect, the distance to the object
grows exponentially and predominates the magniﬁcation
eﬀect.

considerably depends on its position (rp, χp) and on the
acceleration α of the observer. This might be contradic-

nearly behind oneself when one is inﬁnitely apart.

VII. VISUALIZATION OF THE STELLAR SKY

A. Aberration and Doppler shift

What could Tina really see, if she would look out of the
windows of her rocket? If there would be a sphere ﬁxed
at inﬁnity with circles of latitude and meridians each sep-
arated by 5 degrees, Tina would see a warped lattice like
in Fig. 14 and 15. In contrast to the visualization of Scott
and van Driell8 we use the 4π-representation where the
azimuth angle ϕ and the zenith distance ϑ are plotted
like Cartesian coordinates in order to show the full sky.
The disadvantage of this representation is the distortion
at the nodes ϑ = 0 and ϑ = π. Here, the direction of
motion corresponds to the center of the representation
(ϑ = π/2, ϕ = 0).

From the ﬁrst derivative, dχ′/dγ = 0, we get an ex-

Since angular distance gets smaller in the direction of
motion, an object seems to be farther away in comparison
to its real distance. On the other hand, objects in the
opposite direction seem to grow.

Besides the mere geometrical aspects, the following two
ﬁgures show lines of constant Doppler shift (Fig. 16 and
Fig. 17). As long as the velocity β = 0, there is no
Doppler shift, but for velocities β > 0 light is Doppler
shifted following Eq. (32),

z = γ (1

Thus, the faster Tina will be the more of the sky is red-
shifted. Only a small portion of the sky in the direction
of motion is blueshifted.

FIG. 18: The observation angle χ′ is plotted over the veloc-
ity β. The solid lines are lines of constant Doppler shift z
according to Eq. (54), while the dashed lines represent the
aberration of an angle χ, compare Eq. (55).

Objects in front of the observer, χ < π/2, will always
be blueshifted and seem to be in front of him, χ′ < π/2.
But, for objects in the back side of the observer, χ > π/2,
it depends on the velocity whether they apparently are
in front of him or not. Furthermore, an object at an
angle χ > π/2 will turn from being redshifted to being
blueshifted when the velocity β will be faster than

Since we consider stars as point like sources, we have
enough information for visualizing the stellar sky. But
if we would come to close to a star we had to take its
expansion into account. For more information on how
an expanded star would look like we refer the reader to
Kraus12.

C. Constellations

So far, we presented how aberration and Doppler shift
determine the view of the stellar sky as seen by a rela-
tivistic observer. The next three ﬁgures show the stellar
sky of an observer from the position of the Earth but at
diﬀerent velocities in the direction right ascension α = 0
and declination δ = 0, compare Figs. 20-22. Note that
ϑ in comparison
the declination δ corresponds to π/2
to Fig. 9. The stars are connected by lines showing the
constellations.22

from the position of the Earth. +Java-Applet

VIII. A TRIP TO THE END OF THE
UNIVERSE

As a ﬁrst step Tina will go on an expedition to the
center of our galaxy (SgrA*) 8kpc away. As we can read
from table V, her maximum speed is only 2.8ppb (parts
per billion) beyond the speed of light.

With this tremendous velocity even the extremely cold
microwave background radiation13 at Tcmb = 2.725◦ K
comes into the visual regime. But in contrast to one’s
expectation, the Doppler shifted background radiation
would not ﬁll the whole sky. By Wien’s displacement
law (62) an object must have a temperature of about
3700 K to emit its maximum radiation in the
T780 ≈
red light regime with λ = 780 nm. In order to shift the
background temperature to T780 the observer has to move
10−6. However, from Eq.
1.07
1
with a velocity β780 ≈
0 < 3◦ the
(52) follows that only in the small region of χ′
background radiation is blueshifted. The rest of the sky
is redshifted with maximum z

TABLE V: Distance from Earth, maximum speed and proper time of both twins for several stellar destinations. In the solar
system we will reach only a few percent of the speed of light. Thus, time dilation can be neglected. However, already in the
neighborhood of the solar system time dilation is crucial.

galaxy lasts only 20 years with respect to her proper time,
the Milky Way ages about 26, 000 years. In that time,
our sun with rotational velocity24 v
7.34
·
10−4 ly/a will cover a distance of about 19 ly. In order to
fully describe the galactic evolution, we need the position
as well as the proper motion of each star in the galaxy. So
far, the Hipparcos catalogue consisting of about 118, 000
stars, where most of them are at a distance of about
100 pc, delivers the best positional star reference (1 mas).
From the GAIA25 mission one expects an accuracy in
positional astrometry of about 20 µas. Thus, all stars in
our galaxy up to 20th magnitude should be included.

≈

As announced in the title of this article, Tina could
also go on a trip to the “end of the universe” within
life time. Here, the “end” means the maximum distance
of about 13.7 billion light years astronomers are able to
observe. For these speculations we neglect the expansion
of the universe, which is of course not correct. But it is
impossible to know from observations the current status
of the universe.

When Tina reaches maximum velocity β = 1

ǫ with
10−20 in the middle of her journey, the relativis-

tic eﬀects are really extremely dramatic. A γ-factor of
109 results in a diﬀerent time rate: ∆t′ = 1s
about 7.07
corresponds to ∆t = 224a! Thus, in roughly 12 days
with respect to Tina’s proper time our Sun would have
ﬁnished one revolution around the center of our galaxy.
Zero Doppler shift occurs at an angle χ′
3.5as.
The maximum blueshift in the direction of motion is
z (χ′ = 0)
10−11, whereas the maxi-
·
mum redshift is z (χ′ = π)
1010. Since the
2/ǫ
p
≈
transition from redshift to blueshift is quite strong, Tina
would see only a very small, bright dot in the direction
of motion. On the other hand, most of the sky would be
awfully cold and very dark. Navigation by stars would
be completely impossible.

APPENDIX A: JAVA APPLETS

The Java applet TwinApplet handles the diagrams of
section V. There are three input parameters, two of them
are obligatory: the acceleration of the traveling twin Tina
in terms of Earth’s gravity g and either her travel time or
the maximum reachable distance. With these parameters
four plots are calculated. They are grouped in two panels:
one showing the distance and the velocity of Tina and the
other showing the time signals which the twins receive of
each other.

The acceleration of Tina can be modiﬁed between
10−6g and 103g. The travel time of one acceleration
phase can be entered either into a text ﬁeld or with a
slider. While moving the time slider one can observe the
immediate change of the plots and the maximum reach-
able distance. The maximum time is limited to the time
that the twin needs to reach the end of the universe. Al-
ternatively one can choose the travel distance and hence
calculate the time needed. It is possible to save either
the actual shown plots as PNG-images or the calculated
data points in a text ﬁle.

The Java applet RelSkyApplet is able to visualize ei-
ther the stellar sky, the star constellations or the cosmic
microwave background, each with diﬀerent velocities as
seen by an observer passing the Earth. The main in-
put parameters for all views are velocity and the line
of sight (right ascension and declination). For the stel-
lar sky there are some additional parameters such as the
magnitude limiter and the magnitude scale. For the stel-
lar sky and the star constellations it is possible to increase
the velocity stepwise (without changing position) to ob-
serve the rise of eﬀects. By varying the velocity, the user
gets a better understanding of how relativistic aberration
and Doppler shift aﬀects the visualization.

It is possible to choose between two views for the visu-
alizations: A 4π-representation or an hemispherical rep-
resentation. In both cases, the line of sight corresponds
to the center of the representation and can be set man-
ually. The stellar sky can also be seen from any desired
point in our galaxy (either in equatorial coordinates or
in galactic coordinates). By moving the mouse over the

sky-view, the sky coordinates of the actual mouse posi-
tion are displayed in the lower left corner of the applet.
As an additional assistance, longitude and latitude of the
seen sky can be displayed as a grid, which deforms ac-
cording to the increasing velocity.

The stars are realized as small disks whose colors are
calculated according to appendix C with the star temper-
atures. It is possible to change the color mode in order to
examine a special temperature range. In manual mode
the displayed colors correspond merely an arbitrary color
scale. The size of the disk represent the star’s apparent
bolometric magnitude mbol.

By clicking on a star its Hipparcos identiﬁer (HIP) and
(if available) its common name are displayed. Another
click on ”Get Info” provides further information about
the star: the complete Hipparcos data set, as well as some
of its “real” values compared to its “apparent” values.

The star constellations view is suited for observing the
distortion due to the aberration eﬀect. Bear in mind that
the distortion of some constellations in the border area
of the 4π-representation might be caused by the repre-
sentation itself.

The basic data of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) was obtained from WMAP.26 In order to speed up
the applets execution, the original data was downgraded
to a 4π-representation with a solution of 720
360 pix-
els. By selecting the microwave mode the color scale is
automatically set to a temperature range of 2.5 to 2.9
K (which corresponds to the microwave wavelengths).
However, due to the Doppler eﬀect, it is also possible
to observe the microwave background even in the visual
regime (visual color mode) starting at a velocity of about
0.999c.

APPENDIX B: NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS

As we can read from table V, we have to deal with
velocities β which come quite close to the speed of light.

digits, the velocity β = 1

where ˆβ is expressed either in normalized binary form
(subscript 2) or in decimal form (subscript 10).27 Of
course, this machine impreciseness propagates. Hence,
a straight forward numerical calculation of the γ-factor
results in

ˆγ = 1.101111101110100100000112 ×

APPENDIX C: FROM SPECTRUM TO COLOR

The human visual perception of wavelengths lies in the
range between 380nm and 780nm. There are three types
of cones on the retina which are sensible to almost red,
green and blue light. Hence, any visible color can be
composed out of three primary colors.28

In 1931, the Commission Internationale de l’ ´Eclairage
(CIE) deﬁned three artiﬁcial primary colors X, Y and Z
with the corresponding color matching functions29 ¯x(λ),
¯y(λ) and ¯z(λ), compare Fig. 23.

Any color C = XX + Y Y + ZZ can be composed out

Z follow from the spectral intensity distribution I(λ) by
convolution with the color matching functions, e.g.,

X = k

Since we are only interested in the chromaticity values x,
y and z with x = X/(X + Y + Z) and y = Y /(X + Y + Z)
y, the constant k vanishes. In order to get
and z = 1
the rgb values for a speciﬁc device, we need its primary
chromaticity values x(r,g,b,w) and y(r,g,b,w) for red, green,
blue and the white point.30 After the transformation from

the galaxy. Confer Brand & Blitz15 for the outer rotation
curve of the Milky Way.

25 The aim of the GAIA mission is to collect high-precision
astrometric data for the brightest 1 billion objects, com-
pare http://www.rssd.esa.int/.

26 Data is taken from http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov
27 Single-precision ﬂoating-point numbers are stored in a 32-
bit word, whereas double-precision ones are stored in a 64-
bit word. See The IEEE-754 Standard for Binary Floating-
Point Arithmetic, 1985 for further details.
28 This fact is known as the tristimulus theory.
29 Color matching functions can be found at the Institute of
Ophthalmology, http://cvrl.ioo.ucl.ac.uk/basicindex.htm.

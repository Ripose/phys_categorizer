1. Introduction

In any introductory physics course the simple pendulum and the oscillating rigid rod
are usual topics of study and they are not only discussed theoretically but moreover are
part of the basic former experiments done by students. It is because they are simple and
are used to illustrate the extension of a speciﬁc set of data to a general rule, and also
they become one of the ﬁrst approaches to the scientiﬁc thinking. Once the students
have studied the simple pendulum and the oscillating rigid rod, then it is possible to
ask them if there are other possible physical systems, such that the oscillating periods
were bounded by the simple pendulum and the oscillating rigid rod.
It is meaning,
pendulums with an oscillating period in the shaded area of ﬁgure 1. In order to answer
that question, the students will notice that for a simple pendulum the mass is considered
a point mass at the end of a string and in the case of the oscillation rigid rod the mass
is distributed uniformly overall the rigid rod. Then we can propose to the students
an special case of the multiple pendulum like is shown in ﬁgure 2. Equal masses are
uniformly spaced at distances a = L/n, with L the total length of the pendulum and
n the number of masses in this multiple pendulum. The case n = 1 is going to be the
simple pendulum and making the limit n
it would be the oscillating rigid rod.
To be clear, it is worth to mention that the whole set of masses on the string should
oscillate at the same time, it is with the same oscillating period. If it was not the case
then the normal modes of a string motion type in the continuum limit will be arise.

The multiple pendulum has been treated theoretically in many basic books, for
instance [1, 2] and a detailed analysis has been done by M. Braun [3]. On the other
hand some experimental approaches has been done using the paper-clip chain [4] and
this problem was ﬁgured out in a theoretical way in reference [5]. In section 2 some
theory about the multiple pendulum is reviewed. The equations of motion of a multiple
pendulum are derived and expressions for the oscillating period are obtained. The
obtained mathematical expressions agree with the previous ones cited [3, 4, 5]. The
experimental analysis is presented in section 3 and our conclusions are in section 4.

2. Some theory

Consider a pendulum of total length L with n masses spaced a in such way that they
are coupled as it is shown in ﬁgure 2. In general each pendulum have an angle φk, and
therefore the kinetic and potential energy are in each case,

Therefore the expression (9) is useful to study the multiple pendulum as pendulums
with oscillating periods in the bordered area of ﬁgure 1.

3. Experimental Set up

Three diﬀerent experimental arrangements are presented. The ﬁrst goal is to observe
the behavior of the oscillation period of the multiple pendulum as a function of its linear
density mass. In the second experimental set up, the linear density mass is ﬁxed and
the total length of the multiple pendulum is changed. And ﬁnally, it is experimentally
shown that the oscillating period of a multiple pendulum under some conditions can be
between the oscillating period of a simple pendulum and the oscillating period of a rigid
rod. The materials used to do these experiments are thread segments, a photogate time
PASCO ME-9215A and 36 masses. The masses were rubber balls of a radio of 2.55 cm
and 8.4 gr. Although the oscillating period of a pendulum in principle is independent
of the attached mass, the masses were carefully chosen taking into account a diﬀerence
0.2 gr in their weight. Using a common needle through the balls, they were
of about
attached to the thread. First of all, it is necessary to verify that the whole set of masses
are oscillating with the same period and the same φi angle, it means if equation (5) is a
good approach. To verify that condition, the oscillating period for each attached mass in
the multiple pendulum was measured, as is shown in ﬁgure 3a. For a pendulum of eight
attached massses, the masses 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th presented a maximum deviation in
the oscillating period of about 0.2 % respect to the 8th mass. Where the masses are
counted beginning with the mass nearest to the ﬁxed point. Similar results are obtained
for a pendulum of four attached masses and for a pendulum of two attached masses.

3.1. Experimental Set up 1

The total length of the multiple pendulum L = 1.12 m was ﬁxed and the masses were
equally spaced over the total length L, see ﬁgure 3a. The number of masses used were
from 1 to 32 units. The oscillating period was measured for ten oscillations in each
case and the results are shown in table 1. In table 1, the theoretical prediction (Tth)
using equation (9) is compared to the experimental value obtained (Texp) and ﬁnally
the deviation between these two values is shown. Notice that the error is not bigger
than 1.1%. In ﬁgure 4, the oscillating period versus the number of masses n have been
plotted and the dominance of the factor 1/√n from equation (9) is clear. Furthermore
from ﬁgure 4,
increasing the number of masses, the curve is going asintotically to
the value T = 1.737 which is the value of the coeﬃcient for an oscillating rigid rod.
L/d
Experimentally, the upper limit is n =
which is the minimum integer function
of the rate between the total length L and the diameter of the masses d. For this case,
the limit would be 44 masses, and using equation (9), the period is 1.747 s, which is
deviated 0.6 % from the oscillating period of the rigid rod. In ﬁgure 5 the square of
the oscillating period versus the inverse of n have been plotted. The linear behavior is
established.

3.2. Experimental Set up 2

Following the idea of equation (9), an experiment is set up in order to test variations
to the number of attached masses. To do it, the linear density mass n/L is ﬁxed and
it is done chosen the number of masses n = 10 by each meter of total length. The
total length of the multiple pendulum was cut according to (n

It is worth to compare it to equation (10), which is T = 0.519
(n + 0.5). The
correlation coeﬃcient is 0.994 and comparing the experimental ﬁt to the theoretical
expression, the coeﬃcient is deviated 1.5 % and the power number 1.8 %. The number
inside the parenthesis, 0.524, is deviated about 5 %, it is large due to extra contributions
of n [3].

3.3. Experimental Set up 3

Finally, the number of atacched masses (1, 2, 4 and 8) equally spaced is ﬁxed but the
total length L is changed. The results are in ﬁgure 7. Equation (9) has been used to
draw in ﬁgure 7 the diﬀerent oscillating periods between the simple pendulum and the
limit case of a rigid rod. Notice how increasing the number of masses equally spaced
over a total length L, the case of the oscillating rigid rod is gotten. Therefore the period
of a multiple pendulum is between these two limits: a simple pendulum and the limit
case of an oscillating rigid rod. The diﬀerent experimental set up has shown how the
equation (9) is a good expression for the oscillating period of a multiple pendulum.

4. Conclusions

A particular case of the multiple pendulum in the small oscillations approach has been
treated theoretically and experimentally. Theoretically, an expression for the oscillating

. Three basic experiments have been described
in order to show the validity of the theoretical approach. Oscillating periods between
a simple pendulum and a rigid rod have been gotten changing the number of masses
in a multiple pendulum. When the linear density mass of the multiple pendulum is
increased, the oscillating period is going to the limit case of a rigid rod while if it is
decreased the period is tending to the one of a simple pendulum.

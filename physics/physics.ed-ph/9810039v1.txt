resolutions. The paradox is concerned with the Lorentz invariance of
the classical analog of the number of photons.

1 Introduction

Photon are quantum objects and a-priori have no business in classical elec-
trodynamics. So, what can one possibly mean by: Is the number of Photons
a Classical Invariant?

Consider a box ﬁlled with monochromatic radiation of frequency ω. If
U denotes the total electromagnetic energy in the box, then, the right hand
side of

¯hN =

U
ω

(1)

(2)

is a purely classical quantity. The left hand side gives the interpretation and
quantization of this quantity, namely, that it counts the number of photons,
N, in units of ¯h. Eherenfest [3], in the early days of quantum mechan-
ics, stressed the signiﬁcance of classical quantities associated with quantum
numbers, i.e. the right hand side of Eq. (1). According to Ehrenfest such
quantities have distinguished invariance properties.

Let us recall how this applies to the classical harmonic oscillator. The
ratio of energy to frequency of an oscillator is a classical quantity whose
importance in quantum mechanics comes from the fact that it is a function
of the quantum number:

¯h

(cid:19)

But, as Ehrenfest stressed, the ratio of energy to frequency is the classical
adiabatic invariant for the Harmonic oscillator [1]. According to Ehrenfest,
therefore, the classical quantity on the right hand side of Eq. (1) should
also be distinguished by its invariance properties. The simplest of these is
Lorentz invariant. Since neither the energy nor the frequency are Lorentz
invariants, the Lorentz invariance of the ratio is not obvious. If, indeed, the
ratio is Lorentz invariant then one can discover, and motivate, photons on
classical grounds. This approach has its limitations, of course. One still
needs quantum mechanics to understand quantization, and ¯h to actually
count photons.

2 The Paradox

Here is a calculation of how Eq. (1) Lorentz transforms in a simple example.
In this example U
ω turns out not to be Lorentz invariant.

Consider a linearly polarized, plane monochromatic wave of frequency ω

traveling in the ˆx direction. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are:

E = E0 cos(kx − ωt) ˆy, B = E0 cos(kx − ωt) ˆz.

The electromagnetic energy density is

Consider a ﬁctitious rectangular box of proper length L, aligned with the x
axis, whose cross section is A . Suppose that the length of the box is much
larger than the wave length of the radiation. The total energy in the box is

cos2(kx − ωt).

The number of photons in this box, according to Eq. (1), appears to be

Now, let us compute the number of photons, N ′, in the same box, but as
viewed in a frame, S′, moving with velocity v along the x axis. In S′, the
electric ﬁeld amplitude is [4]:

E′

0 =

Ey − (v/c)Bz

1 − (v/c)2 =

E0 − (v/c)E0

1 − (v/c)2 = E0

s

1 − v/c
1 + v/c

The box’s length experiences Lorentz contraction and is now:
L′ = L

1 − (v/c)2

The electromagnetic energy in the box in the moving frame is therefore

ω is transformed according to the Doppler formula [2]:

(1 − v/c) ≈ ¯hN(1 − v/c),

Figure 1. Space time diagram. Each photon is repre-
sented by a dotted line (denoted by p1-p3). The solid
lines (a) and (b) represent the box as viewed at t = 0,
t′ = 0 from the two frames S and S’. The number of
intersections between the photon world lines and the
box gives the total photons inside the box. It is seen
that p2 and p3 are not counted in S’, and therefore
there will be more photons counted is S.

Figure 1 gives a geometric description of this result and illustrates in a
direct way why diﬀerent photon numbers seem to appear in diﬀerent frames.

3 What Went Wrong?

What, if anything, went wrong? One easy way out is to refuse to admit that
there is a problem. A way to do that is to say that Photons can only be
correctly discussed in a quantum context, and the classical point of view of
Ehrenfest is, anyway, of only historical interest. To correctly compute the
number of photons one has to construct the quantum ﬁelds and compute the
photon number in the framework of quantum ﬁeld theory. This is, of course,
nothing but a copout.

The origin of the paradox is not computational or quantum mechanical
but conceptual. It all has to do with what is the correct energy U to put in
the Eq. (1). Let us analyze this in some detail.

Eq. (1) must be viewed as a formula that gives the number of photons
in a ﬁeld conﬁguration in a given time. A ﬁeld conﬁguration is, of course,
extended in space. The ﬁeld conﬁguration associated with a plane wave is
problematic because the total electromagnetic energy is inﬁnite, and so is
the total number of photons. The energy in a box is ﬁnite, however. But,
the box we picked is a virtual box: A box that lets light escape and enter.
So what we learn is that one can not take a part of a ﬁeld conﬁguration and
chop it more or less arbitrarily and still hope that Eq. (1) will correctly count
the number of photons. The equation comes with the proviso that the energy

4

is the total electromagnetic energy of a ﬁeld conﬁguration. To make a ﬁeld
conﬁguration with ﬁnite energy 1 one can conﬁne the electromagnetic ﬁeld
to an ideal, but still real box. This means a box with reﬂecting (that is the
real part) and lossless (that is the ideal part) walls. The ﬁeld conﬁguration
we have picked does not have this properties.

A second way to resolve the paradox is to think about Eq. (1) diﬀerently,
namely, to think of U as the energy absorbed by a photo-detector. In this
case, the energy U is associated with the energy ﬂux swept by a photo-
detector while it is operating, see ﬁg.2. The relevant box is now not a box in
space but a box in time.

tor, and the dots represent photons.

Advantage of a detector is that one can apply Eq. (1) also to ﬁeld conﬁg-

urations, like plane waves, with inﬁnite energy.

Since simultaneity is not a Lorentz invariant concept extended objects
are a pain in special relativity and a source of many paradoxes. Therefore, a
good photodetector must be a small, and ideally, point-like object.

4 Photons in a Box

Photons conﬁned to a box correspond classically to a standing wave. A stand-
ing wave is a superposition of two monochromatic waves of equal frequency
and amplitude, traveling in opposite directions.

Let N→ and N← denote the number of right and left traveling photons,
respectively. In the box’s rest frame, these numbers are equal, and we will
denote them by N/2. In the moving frame, the numbers transform according
to (11):

N ′

→ =

N
2
N

And cheerfully, we ﬁnd N = N ′ and therefore invariant. So, although the
number of right and left movers are not Lorentz invariant, their sum is.

This is good news, because there are no additional quantum numbers in this
problem besides the total number of photons.

Although this calculation gives the desired result, it is a cheat: Generaly,
electromagnetic energies do not add linearly. However, in this case the total
energy can be decomposed into two contributions due to the left and right
traveling radiation. Let E→ = ˆyE→(x, t) and B→ = ˆzE→(x, t) denote the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the right going wave, respectively. Analogously,
the ﬁelds of the left going wave are E← = ˆyE←(x, t) and B← = −ˆzE←(x, t).
The sign of B← is negative because the direction of motion is reversed. The
energy density is:

We see that the cross terms cancel, and the energies of the two waves indeed
add linearly. Note that this result is true regardless of the reference frame,
since we did not assume any relation between E→(x, t) and E←(x, t).

Another way of solving the problem is shown in ﬁg. 3.

Figure 3. Photons in a closed optical ﬁber. Here,
unlike in the box, photons going in opposite directions
don’t interfere, and the energies of the right and left
movers are clearly add.

5 Photo-Detector

A diﬀerent approach to counting photons in a Lorentz invariant way is to
replace the box by a photodetector. Consider a monochromatic plane wave
passing through a thin photon detector whose surface is perpendicular to the
x axis, as can be seen in ﬁg. 2. We will ﬁnd the number of photons passing
through the detector during a given proper time t, assuming that the photons
are point particle.

In the rest frame of the detector, the total energy received by the detector

during the time τ is

Where A is the detector’s surface area. This yields:

for the number of detected photons.

In a moving frame the ﬁeld intensity and frequency transform according
to (2) and (4) respectively. The measurement time experiences time dilation:

What volume will the detector sweep during t′? The detector moves towards
the photons a distance of vt′, while each photon, treated as a point particle,
travels towards the detector a distance of ct′. Therefore, the last photon to
meet the detector at time t′ is exactly vt′ + ct′ far from the detector at t = 0.
The volume swept by the detector is A(v + c)t′. Now we can ﬁnd N ′:

6 Epilogue

This is an account of a paradox and its resolution. It grew out of teacher-
students interaction in the spring semester class of classical electrodynamics
at the Technion. Puzzles and paradoxes are eﬀective means to teach and
learn especially when the teacher does not already know the resolution.

We show that a well known method for measuring the coeﬃcient of restitution of a bouncing ball

can also be used to obtain the gravitational acceleration.

Three contributions to this journal have described how
to measure the coeﬃcient of restitution between a ball
and a ﬂat surface using the sound made by the collision of
the ball with the surface.1,2,3 The procedure reported in
these papers is to drop the ball vertically on a horizontal
surface, allow it to bounce several times, while record-
ing the sound produced by the impacts. Analysis of the
recording gives the time intervals between successive re-
bounds, and from these the coeﬃcient of restitution is
obtained.

The evolution of the techniques described in these pa-
pers is a nice example of how the development of mi-
crocomputers has changed the science teaching labora-
In 1977, Bernstein1 detected the sound with a
tory.
microphone, ampliﬁed and ﬁltered the signal, and fed
it to a pen recorder. Smith, Spencer and Jones,2 in
1981, connected the microphone to a microcomputer via
a homemade data collection and interface circuit, and
then uploaded the resulting data to a larger computer for
analysis and graphical display. In 2001, Stensgaard and
Lægsgaard3 used the microphone input of a PC sound
card to make the recording, reducing the experimental
equipment to basically a standard microcomputer.

To see how the coeﬃcient of restitution ǫ is related
to the time between bounces, note that if ǫ is constant
(independent of velocity), and air resistance is negligible,
the velocity of the ball just after the nth bounce on the
ﬁxed surface is given by

vn = v0ǫn

(1)

where v0 is the velocity just before the ﬁrst impact. The
time-of-ﬂight Tn between the nth and (n + 1)th collisions
is proportional to vn,

Tn =

, n = 1, 2, . . .

(2)

2vn
g

where g is the gravitational acceleration. Thus

Tn = T0ǫn ,
(3)
where we have deﬁned T0 ≡ 2v0/g . Taking the logarithm
of both sides of Eq. (3) we obtain

log Tn = n log ǫ + log T0 ,

(4)

so that the plot of log Tn vs n is a straight line of slope
log ǫ and intercept log T0. Thus, as long as it is inde-
pendent of velocity, the coeﬃcient of restitution can be

obtained by ﬁtting the straight-line of Eq. (4) to the time-
of-ﬂight data.

The purpose of this note is to point out that this
straight-line ﬁt can also be used to determine another
physical quantity of interest: the gravitational accelera-
tion g. The (rather simple) observation is that, if the ball
is released from a known height h, then T0 = (8h/g)1/2,
and

g =

8h
T0

2 .

(5)

Thus, just as the slope parameter of Eq. (4) ﬁxes the
coeﬃcient of restitution, the intercept parameter deter-
mines the acceleration of gravity (if the easily measured
initial height h is known).

In order to check how this works in practice, we have
dropped a “superball” from a measured height onto a
smooth stone surface and recorded the sound produced
by the successive impacts. The recording was made
with the microphone and sound card of a PC running
Windows, using the sound recorder program that comes
with the operating system. The sampling frequency was
22,050 Hz, resulting in a time resolution of 45 µs. The
audio ﬁle, stored in the binary WAV format, was con-
verted to ASCII text format with the shareware program
awave audio.4 The recorded signal is plotted in Fig. 1,

where the pulses corresponding to individual impacts are
easily recognized (only the ﬁrst six collisions are shown).
We have used 8-bit resolution in the recording, so that
data values can only go from 0 to 255. The no-signal
value corresponds to 128.

The time intervals Tn between collisions n and n + 1
were obtained directly through inspection of the ASCII
sound ﬁle. They are plotted in Fig. 2 (in logarithmic
scale) as a function of n. The least-squares ﬁt of the Tn
data set to Eq. (4) gives

of restitution on the time-of-ﬂight (or impact velocity).
Assuming a linear relation between ǫ and T , as suggested
by Fig. 5,

ǫ = ǫ0(1 + αT ) ,

we obtain an extension of Eq. (3)

T0 = 0.4752 ± 0.0005 s .

The best-ﬁt line is also shown in Fig. 2.

The ball was released from a height h = 79.4 ± 0.1 cm
above the surface. Taking this and the adjusted T0 into
Eq. (5), we obtain for the gravitational acceleration

g = 982 ± 3 cm/s2 .

For comparison, the value of g in Rio de Janeiro is
978.8 cm/s2.

The applicability of the method described above de-
pends on ǫ being constant over the range of impact ve-
locities involved in the experiment. That this condition
is satisﬁed in the present case is seen in Fig. 3, where
the coeﬃcient of restitution for an impact at velocity vn,
ǫ = vn+1/vn = Tn+1/Tn, is plotted as a function of Tn
(recall that vn ∝ Tn, see Eq. (2)). The coeﬃcients of
restitution for the diﬀerent impacts are all very close to
the least-squares value given in Eq. (6), indicated by the
dashed line in Fig. 3.

A case in which the coeﬃcient of restitution depends on
the velocity is shown in Fig. 4, where we display the times
of ﬂight of a superball dropped from h = 27.5 ± 0.1 cm
onto a wood surface. A plot of ǫ at each collision, shown
in Fig. 5, reveals a clear dependence of the coeﬃcient

FIG. 5: The coeﬃcient of restitution ǫ = Tn+1/Tn as a func-
tion of Tn, for the data of Fig. 4. The dashed line is the
linear relation of Eq. (7) with the adjusted parameters given
in Eq. (9).

The curves corresponding to these parameters are also

shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The above value for T0 yields

g = 974 ± 5 cm/s2 ,

again a very reasonable value. Consideration of the veloc-
ity dependence of the coeﬃcient of restitution was impor-
tant in order to get an accurate result; had we assumed
a constant ǫ, we would obtain g = 935 ± 10 cm/s2.

To summarize, we have seen that the value of the grav-
itational acceleration is a useful by-product of experi-
ments devised to “hear” the coeﬃcient of restitution of
a bouncing ball. The measurement of g is particularly
simple if the coeﬃcient of restitution is independent of
the impact velocity, but more complicated cases can also
be handled.

After this work was completed we learned of a recent
paper by Cavalcante et al.,5 in which g was measured us-
ing the sound of a bouncing ball. The analysis presented
in the paper is, however, somewhat diﬀerent from ours.

Zanetti6 in this journal.

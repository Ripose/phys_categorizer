Compactiﬁcation of the moduli space in

symplectization and hidden symmetries of its

boundary

Gang Liu

July 26, 2013

1 Introduction

The purpose of this paper and the forth coming [L1], [L3] is to lay down a
foundation for a sequence of papers concerning the moduli space of connecting
pseudo-holomorphic maps in the symplectization of a compact contact manifold
and their applications. In this paper, we will establish the comapctiﬁcation of
the moduli space of the pseudo-holomorphic maps in the symplectization and ex-
hibit some new phenomenon concerning bubbling and the ”hidden” symmetries
of the boundary of the comapctiﬁcation. Combining with the index formula,
which will be proved in [L3], we will show in [L3] that the virtual co-dimension
of the boundary components of the moduli space with at least one bubble is at
least two, while the virtual co-dimension of the boundary components of broken
connecting maps of two elements is one. In [L1], we will show that these virtual
co-dimensions can be realized in the corresponding virtual moduli cycles. In
a sequence of forth coming papers, we will give some of possible applications.
In particular, we will deﬁne various versions of index homology for a contact
manifold, relative index homology for a symplectic manifold with contact type
boundary, as well as their multiplicative structures in these holmologies. These
multiplicative structures can be thought as analogies of the usual quantum prod-
uct and pants product in quantum cohomology and Floer cohomology. We will
also investigate the implication of these homologies to Weinstein conjecture.

It is well-known that a family of pseudo-holomorphic maps in the symplec-
tization of a compact contact manifold may develop bubbles. Since in the sym-
plectization the symplectic form is exact, each top bubble necessarily has non-
removable singularity at inﬁnity, and along the end at inﬁnity, the bubble is
convergent to some closed orbit of the Reeb ﬁeld of the contact manifold. This
makes the behavior of the boundary components of the compactiﬁcation of the
moduli space here very much look like the one of the broken connecting orbits in
the usual Floer homology. In particular, it is believed that the co-dimension of
the boundary components even coming from bubbling should be one in general.
We will show in this paper and [L3] that in the case of the moduli space the

1

pseudo-holomorphic maps connecting at least two closed orbits at the two ends
of the symplectization,at least virtually, this belief is not true.

Our starting point is the the following new phenomenon concerning the
bubbling of connecting pseudo-holomorphic maps. Observe that each time when
a family of pseudo-holomorphic maps connecting two closed orbits splits into
a family of broken connecting maps or develops a bubble, there is not only a
splitting of the domain but also a splitting of the target at same time. Therefore
the R-symmetry of the target splits into a two-dimensional or multi-dimensional
symmetries during the bubbling or splitting. Moreover, the rates of these two
types of degeneration of the domain and target are independent to each other in
general. In fact, the maximum principal implies that in the simplest case when
such a family of connecting maps develops only one bubble, the image of the
bubble lies on a new component on the ”left” of the original one, and there is
also a new principal component on the left of the original principal component.
Note that the new ”left” principal componet may be just a trivial connecting
map. However, the limit map itself is still stable. This last kind of degeneration
plays a rather special role. Therefore, unlike the usual Gromov-Floer theory
in symplectic case, the bubbling here, splits the domain into three components
and the target into two. Note that this phenomenon can only happen when the
pseudo-holomorphic maps involved connect at least two closed orbits lying on
the two ends of the symplectization.

Now using the fact that both symmetry groups of a connecting map and
a bubble with non-removable singularity are three dimensional, it is easy to
see that in term of the dimensions of symmetries, bubbling has co-dimension
three, while the splitting of connecting maps into broken ones is co-dimension
two. This seems to suggest a rather diﬀerent picture on the boundary behavior
of the moduli space in the symplectization, which is not only disprove what
was believed before but also bring us to a situation of dilemma. Namely, the
situation here is even better than the one in the usual Gromov-Floer theory in
symplectic case.

One the the main purpose of this paper and [L1], [L3] is to resolve this
dilemma. In this paper, we will give some key ingradients of the solution of
the dilemma. The main body of this paper is devoted to to deﬁne the notion of
stable maps in the symplectization and to use them to establish the compactness
of the moduli space of such maps. It turns out situation here is diﬀerent from
the usual Gromov-Floer theory. There are various new phenomenons, which
have to be put into consideration in order to to formulate the notion of stable
maps and various related notions.

In symplectic geometry, one of the key ingredients to prove the compactness
of the moduli space of stable maps is the bubbling process. It consists of three
parts: the Uhlenbeck-Sacks rescaling scheme, removable singularity lemma and
the analysis concerning the behavior of the ”connecting tubes”. In the case of
the symplectization of a contact manifold, we have mentioned above that there
is a new phenomenon in the bubbling process. However, as far as the proof
goes, there are still the correspondoing three parts there. The ﬁrst and most
important part of the bubbling was established by Hofer in [H]. He discovered

2

the phenomenon of bubbling in the symplecitization with bubble with non-
removable singularity. Since the top bubble in the symplectization always has
non-removable singularity, the corresponding second part of the bubbling here
is about the asymptotic behavior of a bubble approaching to its non-removable
singularities. In particular, it is important to know that along the end, a bubble
with non-removable singularity approaches to some closed orbit with an expo-
nential decay rate. In the case that the contact manifold is three dimensional,
the desired exponential decay estimate was obtained by Hofer, Wysocki and
Zehnder in [HWZ]. It seem that the third part of the bubbling in the contact
case, especially, the part concerning the behavior of the connecting tubes along
the non-compact R-direction was not addressed before. We emphasize that in
oder to get the desired compactiﬁcation without introducing unstable trivial
connecting maps, it is crucial to know that the ”connecting” tube along the
non-compact R-direction behaves essentially like the trivial connecting map at
C0 sense. Most analytic part of this paper is aimed to establish the second and
the third part of the bubbling process.

Once the above bubbling process is established, the main diﬃculty to es-
tablish the compactiﬁcation of the moduli space is more conceptual rather than
technical. In fact what we need here is a a right deﬁnition of stable maps in
the contact case, which should incorporate those symmetry splitting mentioned
above as well as ”hidden” symmetries in each component of the target (See Sec.
3). In particular, according to the consideration in Sec 3, because of these ”hid-
den” symmetries, one should count the R-symmetry of each component of the
target as many times as the number of the connected components of the domain
lying in the component of the target. This will lead to a somewhat ”strange”
deﬁnition of the quivalence of stable maps in the contact case.

In symplectic geometry, historically, the compactness theorem for pseudo-
holomorphic maps or connecting (J, H)-maps was ﬁrst proved by Gromov and
Floer [G, F] by adding certain degenerate maps, called cuspidal maps. Later a
smaller compactiﬁcation was found by using stable maps, which plays a impor-
tant role for the recent development in symplectic geometry (see, for example,
[LiT], [FO] and [LT]). Technically, there is not much diﬃculty to pass from the
cuspidal map compactiﬁcation to stable map one. The key is to carefully keep
track all marked points naturally introduced in the bubbling, then to study the
deformation of the domain equipped with these marked points in a proper mod-
uli space of curves. In the same vein, the key to get a right compactiﬁcation
in our case is ﬁrst to understand the two crucial points mentioned in last para-
graph, then to keep track carefully all marked points and marked lines in the
domain, marked sections in the target naturally appeared in the bubbling and
to study the deformation of such a structure. Once the desired compactiﬁcation
is established, our main result about the virtual co-dimension of the boundary
will be a consequence of the compactness theorem, the index formula proved in
[L3] and a direct dimension counting argument.

As mentioned above, it has been believed that bubbling for pseudo-holomorphic

maps in symplectization is a co-dimension one phenomenon. This has been
considered as a major diﬃculty to establish various ”simple” and ”elementary”

3

constructions, such as Floer homology and G-W invariants, in contact geome-
try. A very interesting and much more advanced construction were proposed
by Eliashberg, Hofer and Givental under the name contact homology or contact
Floer homology (see [E]).

On the other hand, the work of this paper and [L1], [L3] suggest a rather
diﬀerent picture on the boundary behavior of the moduli space in contact ge-
ometry. This opens the door to construct those ”simple” constructions, such as
Floer homology and G-W invariants in contact geometry, which have essentially
same algebraic structures as the ones in symplectic geometry. It also makes it
possible to generalize various important constructions in symplectic geometry.
We now brieﬂy mention some of these possible applications, which are outlined
in the Sec. 5.

The ﬁrst application is to deﬁne an analogy of Floer homology in contact
geometry. To distinguish our construction with the one in [E], which is under
the name contact homology or contact Floer homology, we call our construc-
tion index homology. The most natural way to do this is to use the closed
orbits of the Reeb ﬁeld to generating a chain group and to count the pseudo-
holomorphic maps connecting two closed orbits to deﬁne the boundary map.
As mentioned above, the co-dimension of the component of broken connect-
ing pseudo-holomorphic maps is one, and bubbling is a co-dimension two phe-
nomenon. Therefore, we are in the exactly the same situation as the usual Floer
homology, and the desired index homology can be established as an invariant of
the contact structure. Once this is done, one can also construct G-W invariants
and use them to deﬁne ring structure and the action of the usual homology
of the contact manifold on the index homology, which are the analogies in the
usual quantum cohomology. To see that the index homology so deﬁned is not
always trivial, we introduce Bott-type index homology as a computational tool.
Using the Bott-type homology, we can compute the index homology for a con-
tact manifold, which appears as a regular zero locus of some local Hamiltonian
function which generates a S1 Hamiltonian action. It turns out that the index
homology of the contact manifold in this case is just the inﬁnite copies of the
usual homology of its symplectic quotient indexed by the periods of the closed
orbits. Of course the non-vanishing of index homology implies the Weinstein
conjecture. Therefore, as a corollary, we proved the Weinstein conjecture in
above case.

It is also possible to to use the moduli space diﬀerently to deﬁne various
versions of index homology. In particular, in Sec 5, we will outline how to deﬁne
an additive quantum homology of a contact manifolds and relative quantum
homology of a symplectic manifold with contact type boundary.

There are also some other important constructions that can be generalized.
For example, the relative G-W invariant and its gluing formula can be estab-
lished in general, which was developed by Li-Ruan in [LiR] before with an extra
assumption on the existence of some local S1 Hamiltonian action.

This paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. 2, we will collect and prove some basic facts about the ﬁrst part
of bubbling. Almost all of statements there are well-known due to the work

4

of Hofer and his collaborators. However, for the completeness, we give details
of the proof for most of these statements. Besides several technical lemmas in
section, the most important thing in section is the introduction of Hofer’s energy
function, which leads to the important notion of ﬁnite energe plane in [H].

In Sec. 3, we formulate the notion of stable maps in the symplectization
and the weak-topology of the moduli space of such maps. We then proved the
compactness of the moduli space and the statement concerning the co-dimension
of its boundary, modulo the statement concerning the exponential decay of a
bubble approaching its non-removable singularity and the statement concerning
the behavior of the ”connecting tube”. Both of these statements are proved in
Sec. 4.

The last section, Sec 5, is an outline of some possible applications. the detail

of these applications will appear in forth coming papers.

Let (M 2n+1, ξ) be a contact manifold. This means that ξ is a generic 2n-
dimensional subbundle of T M . A contact form λ = λξ associated to ξ is a
1-form such that λ ∧ (dλ)n 6= 0 and ξ = kerλ. The 2-form dλ is non-degenerate
when restricted to ξ and has a 1-dimensional kernel at each tangent space of
M . We denote by η the line bundle generated by ker(dλ).
It has a canonic
section Xλ deﬁned by requiring that λ(Xλ) = 1. Since ξ ∩ η = {0}, we have
T M = ξ ⊕ RXλ. Let π : T M → ξ be the projection to the ﬁrst summand.

• Symplectization:

The symplectization of (M 2n+1, ξ, λ) is deﬁned as follows.

Let fM be M × R equipped with the exact symplectic form ω = d(er · λ),

where r is the coordinate for the R-factor. Since dλ is symplectic along ξ, there
exists a dλ-compatible almost complex structure J deﬁned on ξ. In fact, the set
of all such J’s is contractible. We extend J to an r-invariant almost complex
structure ˜J by requiring:

˜J(

• Equation for ˜J-holomorphic curves in fM
Let ˜u = (u, a) : Σ = S1 ×R → fM be a ˜J-holomorphic map where u : Σ → M

and a : Σ → R. Then we have

˜J(˜u) ◦ d˜u = d˜u ◦ i,

Equation (⋆)2 is equivalent to the following equations:

Lemma 2.2 Let (X, d) be a complete metric space and φ : X → R+ = [0, ∞)
be a continuous function. Given x ∈ X and ǫ > 0, there exists x′ ∈ Xand ǫ′ > 0
such that

(2) d(x, x′) ≤ 2ǫ;

The proof is elementary. See [H-V].

Proposition 2.1 Let ˜un = (un, an) : R1 × S1 (or C)→ fM be a sequence of ˜J-
n=1 a bubble ˜v : C → fM , which is

holomorphic maps such that (i) there exists a constant c > 0 such that E(˜un) <

(c) E(˜v) < c.

Proof:

Apply Lemma 2.2 to the case that (X, d) = R1 × S1, φ = |d˜un|, x = xn, and
n=1 is a sequence such that dn · ǫn = |d˜un(xn)| · ǫn → ∞. We

ǫ = ǫn, where {ǫn}∞
may assume that

(a) |d˜un(xn)| · ǫn → ∞;
(b) 2|d˜un(xn)| > |d˜un(y)| for any y ∈ Dǫn(xn);

(c) ˜un(xn) ∈ M × {0} after a translation in fM .
Fix R > 0, deﬁne ˜vn,R : DR → fM to be ˜vn,R(x) = ˜un(xn + x

Note that when n is large enough, dn · ǫn > R. Hence, xn + x

That is F = a + f i is holomorphic on C. Note that here we treat a as a function

∂z is also
holomorphic.

Now |dF |2 = | ∂F

∂z |2. If |da| is bounded, then |df | is also
bounded. The holomorphic funtion F ′ deﬁned on C has bounded norm, hence,
is a constant. This implies that

F = c · z + d = (c1 + c2i) · (s + ti) + d1 + d2i = (c1s − c2t + d1) + (c1t + c2s + d2)i.

Hence f = (c1t + c2s + d2) and a(s, t) = c1s − c2t + d1. Sinece a is periodic in
t: a(s, t + 1) = a(s, t). This implies that a = c1 · s + d1.

We claim that in this case x(t) is a closed orbit of Xλ, Suppose this is
not true, f has to be periodic in t: f (s, t + 1) = f (s, t). This implies that
f = c2 · s + d1. Now

But

implies that c1 = c2 = 0, and hence F is constant.

Therefore, we may assume that |da|, hence |d˜u| is not bounded. Then the
bubbling process described before is applicable to this case and will produce a

bubble ˜v : C → fM with the properties that (a) E(˜v) < ∞; (b) ˜v∗(dλ) = 0; (c)

|d˜v(0)| = 1; (d) |d˜v| is bounded. But we will prove in Lemma 5 that (a) and
(b) imply that ˜v is a constant map. This contradicts with (c).

QED

Proof of Lemma 2.5

As in Lemma 2.4, we have u = x◦f and F = a+f i is holomorphic. If |df | and
hence |d˜u| is unbounded, as above, we would have a bubble ˜v = (v, a) with the
properties (a)-(d) above. Then (b) implies that v = x1 ◦f1 and F1 = a1 +f1i are
holomorphic. Now (d) implies that |da1| and hence |df1| is bounded. Therefore

∂z F1 has bounded norm. Hence

F1 = (c1s − c2t + d1) + (c1t + c2s + d2)i

get F = cz + d again. As above E(˜u) < ∞ implies that c = 0.

with sn → ±∞ such that |d˜u(xn)| → ∞. This will produce a bubble ˜v with the

10

properties (a)-(d) as in Lemma 2.4. Note that (b) ˜v∗(dλ) = 0 follows from the
fact that the s-coordinate of xn = (sn, tn) tends to ±∞. As in Lemma 2.4, this
leads to a contradiction. The proof for the case that ˜u : C → ˜M is the same.

QED

Now assume that the contact 1-form λ is generic so that 1 is not an eigen
value of the Poincare ˘are returning map at any closed orbit of Xλ. This implies
that the set of unparameterized closed orbits of Xλ are discrete.

Proposition 2.3 Let ˜u : R1×S1 → fM be a ˜J-holomorphic map with E(˜u) < ∞

and ˜u 6= constant map. Then lims→∞ ˜u(s, t), when being projected to M is either
a closed orbit of Xλ or a constant map. Assuming the ﬁrst case happens, then
˜u(s, t) is convergent to two closed orbits x± asymptotically with a exponential
decay rate.

Proof: The proof for the part concerning the exponential decay of the last
statement is given in Sec. 4.

By proposition 2.2, there exists a C > 0 such that |d˜u| < C. For any ﬁxed

convergent to ˜vL after taking a subsequence and ˜v = ˜u(s + n, t) is locally C∞-

L > 0, we deﬁne ˜vn,L = ˜u(s + n, t) : [−L, L] × S1 → fM . Then ˜vn,L is C∞-
convergent to ˜v∞ : R1 × S1 → fM such that E(˜v∞) < ∞ andRR1×S1 ˜v∗(dλ) = 0.
and c = RS1 x∗λdt. Note that in the later case, a(˜vn(s, t)) → ±∞ as n → ∞.

Hence ˜v∞ = constant map or ˜v∞(s, t) = (x(c · t + d1), c · s + d2) with dx

We may assume that c > 0, and hence a(s + n, t) → +∞ as n → ∞.

dt = Xλ(x)

Assume the second case happens. Applying the same argument to the neg-
ative end of R1 × S1, we get limn→∞ p ◦ ˜u(s − n, t)|[−L,L]×S1 = x−(c−t + d−)
for some closed orbits x− of Xλ of period c−, or a constant map. Here p is the

projection fM → M. Assume again that it is not the constant map.

˜u∗(λ) = c+ − c−.

If ˜u(s + ni, t)|[−L,L]×S1, ni → ∞ is any other convergent sequence, then the
limit must also be a closed orbit of period c+. Let x′ be the closed orbit. Under
the assumption that λ is generic, there are only ﬁnite c-period closed orbits of
Xλ. If x 6= x′, we can ﬁnd (si, ti) ∈ R1 × S1 with si → +∞ and ˜u(si, ti) 6∈ a
small neighborhood of the set of c-closed orbits. Then ˜u(s + si, t)|(−L,L)×S1 is

C∞-convergent to a constant map. This implies thatRR1×S1 ˜u∗(dλ) = −c− and

leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, we conclude that x and x′ are the same as unparameterized
curves. Then it t is easy to see that as parametrized curve there is also only
one limit lims→±∞ p ◦ ˜u(s, t) = x±(c±t + d±).

In the case of the above limits are closed orbits, lims→±∞ a(s, t) = ±∞. This
can be seen easily from the explicit expression of the limit of local convergence
of the sequence ˜vn,L introduced at the beginning of the proof.

Let M± be the two ends of ˜M = M × R. We consider subset of all ﬁnite energy
˜J-holomorphic maps whose two ends asymptotically approximate to two closed

induced from R-actions on the target and the domain are never identical unless
they act on the trivial ˜u = ˜u(s, t) = (x±(t), s).

• Stable ˜J-map connecting x− and x+:
There are two diﬀerent ways to deﬁne this notion. One is saver but gives less
information. We start with this saver one ﬁrst. The Remark 3.2 in this section
will tell us how to modify the deﬁnition here to get the more informative one.

12

Domain Σ = Σ˜u of a stable ˜J-map ˜u connecting x− and x+ can be written
as Σ = ∪iΣpi ∪j Σbj , i = 1, · · · , P , and j = 1, · · · , B, of the union of domains Σp
of its principal components and Σb of its bubble components. Each Σp or Σb
is holomorphically equivalent to S2. As a curve, Σ is semi- stable. This means
that the worst singularity of Σ is double point singularity. The components of Σ
form a connected tree. There are two particular marked points −∞ on Σp1 and
+∞ on ΣpP . on each Σpi , there are double points di,− and di,+ such that Σpi and
Σpi+1 are jointed together in Σ at the double point d = di,+ = di+1,−. Therefore,
the domain of principal component forms a chain. These joint double points
di = di,+ = di+1,− are divided into two classes according to the asymptotic
behavior of u when u approaches di. We will use IP to denote the set of those
indices i such that u approximates to some closed orbit xpi when it approaches
di, while for the other i ∈ P \ IP , ˜u is well deﬁned at di,+ = di+1,−. Similarly,
for all other double points of Σ, we will make such a distinction. For each
of the double point which is treated as inﬁnity of an end, we will introduce
a ﬁx S1-parameterization at the inﬁnity of the end. We will include this as
part of the structure of Σ. This can be done, for example, by identify a small
neighborhood U of some double point d with two copies of R+×S1 and using the
S1-parameterization on each of R+×S1 to give the desired S1-parameterization.
For the later application, we mention the following ”canonical” way to give the
S1-parameterization for the double point on each of top bubbles in the bubble
tree. For each of such bubble, we ﬁrst add a marked point y, then choose
another marked point z along the circle of of the radius 1 centered at y. The
ray connecting y and z and started at y gives the required parameterization at
inﬁnity. We remark that it is only the parameterization itself is included in the
structure of Σ, not the other things used to deﬁne it. Therefore the dimension
of the symmetry group of a top bubble is three.

Note that our deﬁnition of the domain of a stble map is similar to the
one used in the usual Gromov-Floer theory. However if we restricted to the
compactiﬁcation of M(x−, x+; ˜J), then the domains of its elements subject to
further restrictions. Although it does not eﬀect constructions in this paper and
the subsequent forth coming papers in any essential way, these furth restrictions
simplify the possible intersection pattern of domains and make the situation here
is diﬀerent from the corresponding case in the Gromov-Floer theory. We refer
the readers to Remark 3.2 of this section on this.

The target U of ˜u is a union U = ∪i∈IP

˜Mpi with each ˜Mpi ≃ ˜M . Note
that here we have somewhat abused the notation as it may happen that on each
˜Mpi, there may exist more than one ˜upi ’s. Each ˜M has two ends ˜Mpi,± and
we identify ˜Mpi,+ with ˜MPi+1,−. On each Mpi,±, there is a particular closed
orbit xpi,± associated to each index pi, i ∈ IP and possibly some other closed
orbits xpi,bj,l, i = 1, · · · , P . Here bj,l are indices of the double points on bubble
component Σpi,bj . Here we have relabeled bubble component Σbk before as
Σpi,bj , where pi is principal component on which the bubble Σbk lies.

Note that x− lies on the negative end of the ﬁrst ˜Mpi ’s and x+ lies on the

positive end of the last ˜Mpi’s, pi ∈ IP .

i=1 ˜upi ∪B

The stable map ˜u = ∪P
(i) ˜upi : Σpi − {double points} → ˜Mφ(pi) and ˜ubj : Σpi,bj \ {double points} →
˜Mφ(pi) are ˜J- holomorphic. Here φ(pi) is a function from the set of indices
{1, · · · , P } to IP , which is the identity map when being restricted to IP .

j=1 ˜upi,bj such that

(ii) Along each end near the double point di ∈ Σpi , ˜upi is convergent expo-
nentially to some parametrized periodic orbit xpi , if i ∈ IP . Otherwise, ˜upi is
well-deﬁned at di and ˜u has an ordinary double point at di. Similarly at each
double point on bubble components or double point on principal components
other than these di’s, ˜u either asymptotically approximates to a closed orbit x
or it extends smoothly across these double points. Note that in the case that
˜u asymptotically approximates to a parameterization closed orbit along some
double point, the S1-parameterization (covering) of the closed orbit is given by
the S1-parameterization of the end.

(iii) On each ˜Mpi , i ∈ IP , there is an R1- action of r-translation. We require
that the isotropy subgroup of the components of ˜u in ˜MPi is not the entire
R1. This implies that each ˜Mpi contains at least one bubble components if the
principle component of ˜u in ˜Mpi is a trivial component. Here a trivial principal
component of ˜u in ˜Mpi is the ˜J-holomorphic map ˜upi : R1 ×S1 → ˜Mpi such that
˜upi(s, t) = (x(ct), cs + d) for some periodic orbit x in M . Clearly the isotropy
group of such an ˜upi is R1 itself.

(iv) Each constant bubble component is stable in the sense that it contains

at least three double points.

(v) ˜u connects x− and x+, meaning that it connects some x′

− ∈ {x−} and

x′
+ ∈ {x+}.

Note that similar to the stable maps used in the usual Floer homology, there
are two kinds of trivial components, and the trivial principal components play
similar role as closed orbits of a Hamiltonian system regarded as trivial principal
components of a stable (J, H)-map in Floer homology. The reason to rule out
this kind of components can be seen as follows.

Example
Let ˜u : S1 × R1 → ˜M be a ˜J- holomorphic map connecting two closed orbits
x− and x+. Assume that ˜u is not trivial. Hence the eﬀect of the R-actions on ˜u
induced by the R-actions on ˜M is diﬀerent from those induced by the R-actions
on the domain S1 × R1. Deﬁne ˜un(s, t) = ˜u(s + n, t). Then {˜un}∞
n=0 is locally
C∞-convergent to ˜u∞ = ˜u∞,0 ∪ ˜u∞,1 where ˜u∞,0 = ˜u and ˜u∞,1 : R1 × S1 → ˜M1
with ˜u∞,1(s, t) = (x+(ct), cs + d). Iterating this process, we can produce any
number of trivial principal components as limit.

Note that this example also indicates that even though the energy E(˜u) is

a constant for any ˜u ∈ fM(x−, x+; J), it is not preserved when passing to the
limit. We will see that for the element ˜u in the moduli space ˜u ∈ fM(x−, x+; J)
On the other hand, the quantity RR1×S1 ˜u∗dλ is obviously preserved under the

of stable connecting maps, the energy is uniformly bounded. However, without
the assumption of stability, there is no such a bound as above example shows.

• Compactness

14

Let

M(x−, x+; J) = {[˜u] | ˜u is a stable ˜J-map connecting x− and x+; E(˜u) is ﬁnite.}.

Here [˜u] is the equivalent class of ˜u.

The deﬁnition here needs some explanation.

In the usual quantum ho-
mology and Floer homology in sympletic geometry, to form the moduli space
M(x−, x+; J) and its compactiﬁcation, one needs to ﬁx a relative homotopy
class, which is represented by the elements in these moduli spaces. Therefore,
there are options here. One is to follow the usual deﬁnition, which is saver but
less informative. We will leave the rutin formulation of this saver deﬁnition to
our reader. On the other hand, the Remark 3.2 together with the next two
lemmas imply that. One still can prove the compactness without restricting to
a particular relative homotopy class.

Deﬁnition 3.1 Two stable ˜J-map ˜u1 and ˜u2 connecting x−, x+ are said to be
equivalent if there exists an equivalence φ : Σ1 → Σ2 of their domains and an
equivalence ψ : ˜U1 → ˜U2 of the liftings of their targets such that u1 = ψ−1◦u2◦φ,
where φ is a homomorphism of Σ1 and Σ2 such that it is bi-holomorphic along
each of their components and preserves the variable t ∈ S1 along the chain of
principal components and preserves the S1-parameterizations at inﬁnity along
those ends of bubble components or principal components approaching to some
closed orbits, and ψ is induced from R-translations on each component of the
target U , in the sense explained in the following. Here ˜U1 and ˜U2 are certain
ﬁnite liftings determined by the connected components of the bubble tree in each
of the components of U ’s.

Note that the components of the domain Σ of a stable map ˜u forms a con-
nected tree. If we ﬁx a component ˜Mi = ˜M of the target U , and collect those
components of the domain in the bubble tree above whose images stay in ˜Mi,
the components may not be connected anymore. We will associated to each of a
connected components Σi,j,j = 1, · · · , Ji, of the domain in ˜Mi, a ˜Mi,j = ˜M . We
collect all of these ˜Mi,j together with same ends as before as the lifting of U men-
tioned above. Then the ψ deﬁned above is just induced by the R-translations
on each component of ˜U ’s. In particular, it follows from this deﬁnition that on
each component of the target of a stable map, there are as many dimensions of
R1-actions as the number of the connected components of the domain in the
component of the target.

There is a special case that the above deﬁnition on connected component
of the domain in a component of the target is not applicable. According to
above deﬁnition, if a component of the target contains a trivial connecting map,
the domain of this map clearly is an isolated component in the domain of the
orignal map inside the component of the target. For the obvious reason that
one can not assign an extra R1-symmetry of the target associated the the trivial
map. However, as we will prove in this section that on the component of the
target, there exists at least one non-trivial connected component of the domain.

15

We simply deﬁne a connected component in this case as the union of the non-
trivial one with the domain of the trivial map.
In the case that there are
several non-trivial connected components together with several trivial maps in
one component of the target, we consider all possible combinations of them and
consider this as part of the data in the deﬁnition of stable map. Another way to
deal with this particular case is to only count the R1-symmetry of the domain
for each of such stable component.

With this interpretation, we note that with respect to the symmetry group
so deﬁned, the isotropy group of a stable map is always ﬁnite, which is important
for deﬁning the virtual moduli cycles in [L1] and will be proved there.

Theorem 3.1 M(x−, x+; J) is compact and Hausdorﬀ with respect to the C∞-
weak topology, which is a compactiﬁcation of M(x−, x+; J).

Proof:
The Hausdorﬀness follows from the stability of elements in ¯M(x−, x+; J).
The proof of the corresponding theorem in [LT] can be easily adapted here. We
refer our readers to the proof there.

Lemma 3.2 There exists a constant N = N (x−, x+) such that for any ˜u ∈
[˜u] ∈ M(x−, x+; J), the number of components of u is less than N .

Proof:
By using local convergence, one can easily show that there exists a ﬁxed
ǫ > 0, such that for any non-trivial bubble ˜ub, Eλ(˜ub) > ǫ. Same conclusion
holds for non-trivial principal component ˜up : S1 × R1 \ {double points} → ˜M .
Note that here we used x− 6= x+.

Since

Eλ(˜u) = Σb,pEλ(˜ub) + Eλ(˜up)

is ﬁxed, we only need to prove that the number of trivial principal components
and trivial bubble components is uniformly bounded.

Now for each trivial principal component, there exists some non-trivial bub-
ble components lying on the same target component. Therefore, the number
of such components is less than or equal to the number of non-trivial bubble
components, which is bounded. Finally, it is easy to see inductively that the
number of trivial bubble components can be uniformly bounded by the number
of non-trivial bubbles and principal components.

Lemma 3.3 Given ˜u ∈ [˜u] ∈ M(x−, x+; J), if x is a closed orbit such that it

Therefore, there are only ﬁnite such closed orbits.

To see that there are only ﬁnite such intermediate x, we use Remark 3.2.

It follows from the remark there that R x∗λ is bounded below by ǫ > 0 of the

lower bound of the Eλ-energy of non-trival bubbles.

It follows from this argument that the number of double points of a compo-

nent of a stable map appeared in the compactiﬁcation is also bounded.

Because of these lemma, the proof of the theorem essentially can be reduced

• Stabilization of the target and its local deformation
The target of ˜u of a stable map is a union U = ∪i∈IP

˜Mpi. Each ˜Mpi ≃ ˜M =
M × R with a R1-symmetry coming from the r-translations along the second
factor R. To stabilize U , we add a marked point zi on the second factor of ˜Mpi
to remove theses symmetries. Given ( ˜Mi, zi) = M ×(R, zi), i = 1, 2 and τ ∈ R+
of a deformation (gluing) parameter, we can form Uτ = ( ˜M1, z1)#τ ( ˜M2, z2) of
the local deformation of U = ( ˜M1, z1) ∪ ( ˜M2, z2) with respect to the parameter
τ by the obvious gluing construction along the second factor of ˜M1 and ˜M2,
namely, cutting oﬀ r1 > 1
τ and gluing back the remaining
parts. Then Uτ ≃ M × R with two marked points z1 and z2 on R. Similarly,
˜M0i and τ = (τ1, · · · , τγ−1) ∈ (R+)γ−1, γ = #(IP ), with γ marked
if U = ∪i∈IP
˜Mpγ
points zi ∈ ˜Mpi , i = 1, · · · , γ, we can form Uτ = ˜Mp1#τ1
with marked points z1, · · · , zγ on it. Another way to think this is to treat the

τ of ˜M1 and r2 < − 1

˜Mp2# · · · #τγ−1

marked point zi as a marked section M × {zi} in fMi.

A cylinder ˜M = M × (R; −∞, +∞, z1, · · · , zn) with two end points −∞ and
+∞ and n distinct marked points z1, · · · , zn is said to be stable of type M if
n ≥ 1.
let Mn(M ) be the collection of all such stable cylinders of n marked
points of type M . Then it has an obvious compactiﬁcation

¯Mn(M ) = Mn(M ) al + m = n

The topology of ¯Mn(M ) near the boundary points is described by the local
deformation (gluing) above.

• Weak Convergence
• Stabilization of a semi-stable curve and its local deformation:
Domain Σ of a stable map ˜u is only a semi-stable curve. Therefore, there
may exist some non-trivial bubble components or principal components whose
domains contain only one or two double points. We can stabilize these unstable
components by adding minimal number of marked points y = (y1, · · · , ym) to
get a stable curve (Σ, y). In particular, for each top (hence, unstable ) bubble,
the symmetry group is three dimensional because of extra structure of the S1-
parametrization at inﬁnity along its end. To stabilize such a component we
introduce an arbitary marked point y1 ﬁrst. Then the S1-parametrization at
inﬁnity together with the marked point determine a marked ray connecting y1
to θ = 0 at S1 at inﬁnity an obvious way. We add the second marked point y2
on the marked ray with distance of 1 to y1 to get the desired stablization. Let
(Σα, y) the local deformation of (Σ, y) in the moduli space of stable curves, where
α is the collection of deformation parameters associated with double points
of Σ. Note that the moduli space of stable maps used here is not the ususal
Degline-Mumford compactiﬁcation but an obvious modiﬁcation of the moduli
space of stable (J, H)-maps used in [LT]. Here for each ordinary double point
of ˜u, we associate it with a complex gluing parameter and for each double point
corresponding to an end approaching to closed orbit, we associate a positive real
gluing parameter.

To see this more concretely, we consider the following example.
Example
Consider the semi-stable curve Σ = P ∪d1=d2 B with principal component
P = R × S1 and bubble B joint at the double point d. Assume that the
double point corresponds to the two end on P and B. Not that on P there
are other two marked points corresponding to −∞ and +∞ in R × S1. The
moduli space of such semi-stable map is 1-demensional due to the choices of
S1-parametrization at d. To stable such a Σ, we only need to stabilize B, which
is described above. Associated to the double point, there is a one dimensional
local deformation of Σ with respect to a gluing parameter α ∈ R+. By letting
Σ vary in above 1-dimension moduli space, the deformation gives the elements
in the moduli space M0,4, which form a neighbourhood the the 1-dimensional
moduli space. Therefore, the above 1-dimensional moduli space can be thought
as part of the boundary of M0,4. Of course, this not the usual Degline-Mumford
compactiﬁcation of M0,4. On the other hand, give any sequence Σi ∈ M0,4 with
Σi = (R × S1; −∞, +∞, yi, zi with yi → zi as in the bubbling below, the process
there will give a limit of the sequence in the above 1-dimensional moduli space.

• Deﬁntion of Weak Convergence:
Given [˜ui]∞

i=1 ∈ M(x−, x+; ˜J), we say that [˜u] is weakly C∞-convergent to

[˜u∞] ∈ M(x−, x+; ˜J) if there exist ˜ui ∈ [˜ui] and ˜u∞ ∈ [˜u∞] such that

number of marked points of z∞. Therefore, there exists τi such that (Ui, zi) is

contact manifold M is C0-close to the projection of the image ˜u∞, and that
near a closed orbit x with λ-period c as an asymptotic end of ˜u∞, along the
non-compact R-direction of ˜M , ˜ui is essential same as the function c · s, when
i is large enough.

We start with a detailed description on the case that the sequence [˜ui] only
develops one bubble, as it already exhibits all of the main points of the general
case. The following lemma plays an important role both in the proof of this
theorem and in the later formal dimension counting of the boundary of the
modui space of ˜J- holomorphic maps.

i=0 ∈ M(x−, x+; ˜J) develops only one bubble at its limit
Lemma 3.4 If {[˜ui]}∞
[u∞], then the target U∞ contains at least two elements and the image of bubble
is not in the right most component. This implies that the domain Σ∞ of u∞
contains at least three components.

Proof:

Let ˜ui ∈ [˜ui], ˜ui = (ui, ai) : Σi = R1 × S1 → fM , where ui : R1 × S1 → M

and ai : R1 × S1 → R. By assumption, there exists bubble point yi ∈ Σi
such that |d˜ui(yi)| → ∞. First assume that yi stays in a compact set of
Σi = R1 × S1, hence yi → y∞ ∈ R1 × S1 as i → ∞ after taking a sub-
sequence. We claim that |ai(yi)| is not bounded and ai(yi) tends to −∞.
Otherwise, assume that |ai(yi)| < C. Then ai(yi) → a∞,y ∈ R. Now the

19

1

domain of Σi has two marked points yi and wi, where wi is a point on the
circle centered at yi of radius
|d˜ui(yi)| . Note that here we can make an arbitary
choice for wi on the circle. See the remark after on how to make ”correct”
choice. These two marked points yi, wi together with −∞, +∞ on S2 = Σi ∪
{−∞, +∞} have moduli, and we can identify the domain (Σi, −∞, +∞, yi, wi)
with (Σi, −∞, ∞, d)#αi (S2, 0, 1, d′). Here (Σi; −∞, ∞, d)#αi (S2; 0, 1, d′) is ob-

tained from (Σi; −∞, ∞, d)Wd=d′(S2; 0, 1, d′) by gluing at d with some deforma-
tion parameter αi ∈ R+ with αi → 0 as i → ∞, and (Σi; −∞, ∞, d)Wd=d′(S2; 0, 1, d′)

is one of the elements in the 1-dimensional moduli space mentioned in the pre-
vious example. In particular, along the end d, there is a S1-parametrization.
Intuitively, what we did here is to

conformally enlarg a small disc of Σi near yi, bringing yi, wi into standard

points 0, 1 in standard disc.

Now (Σi#αi S2; −∞, ∞, 0, 1) has four marked points −∞, ∞, 0, 1, and

(Σi#αi S2; −∞, ∞, 0, 1) ≃ (Σi; −∞, ∞, yi, wi).

: (Σi#αi S2; −∞, ∞, 0, 1) → (Σi; −∞, ∞, yi, wi) be the identiﬁcation
Let φi
map. Let DR be the half shpere glued with a ﬁnite cylinder S1 × [0; R] along its
boundary. We still use DR to denote its obvious conformal image in (S2; 0, 1, d′) ⊂

age in Σi#αi S2 when i is large enough.

(Σi; −∞, ∞, d)Wd=d′(S2; 0, 1, d′) centered at 0, and DR,i the corresponding im-
Deﬁne eVi,R = (˜ui ◦ φi)|DR,i . Then as we did before for bubbling, ˜vi,R →
˜v∞,R : DR → fM and ˜vi = ˜ui ◦ φi is locally C∞-convergent to ˜v∞ = ∪R˜v∞,R :
D∞ = D2∪(R+×S1) → fM . That is {˜ui} produce a bubble at yi. The domain of

˜v∞ is the complex plane but thought as half sphere with a half inﬁnite cylinder
attached. Since ˜v∞ is ˜J-holomorphic and E(˜v∞) < ∞, |D˜v∞| is uniformly
bounded. As before, lims→+∞ v∞(s, t) = x(t) of some periodic orbit along
its cylindrical end. Now ﬁx ǫ > 0, and consider ˜ui,ǫ = ˜ui|Σi\Dǫ(yi). By our
assumption that there is only one bubble we conclude that for any ﬁxed ǫ > 0,
|d˜ui,ǫ| < Cǫ for any i. We may assume that limi ˜ui(0, 0) exists at the begining
and yi 6= (0, 0). Then the same argument as before implies that ˜ui,ǫ is C∞-

convergent to ˜u∞,ǫ : R1 × S1 \ Dǫ(y∞) → fM . Here we used that |yi| is bounded

and hence yi → y∞ ∈ R1 × S1. By letting ǫ → 0, we get ˜ui|Σi\{yi} is locally C∞-
convergent to ˜u∞|R1×S1\{y∞}. Identifying Dǫ(y∞) − {y∞} (⊂ R1 × S1 − {yi})
with R+ × S1, then lims→∞ u∞(s, t) = x′(t) of a closed orbit.

Let ˜v∞ = (v∞, b∞). Then lims→∞ b∞(s, t) = +∞. Otherwise, since b∞(s, t) ∼

∆b∞ ≥ 0, this contradicts to the maximal principle for sub-harmonic functions.

cs + d with c = RS1 x∗λ 6= 0, we have lims→∞ b∞(s, t) → −∞. But since
Therefore, b∞(s, t) ∼ cs + d with c =RS1 x∗λ > 0. The induced orientation

of ˜v∞ on x is the same as the one given by λ. By our assumption that there
is only one bubble, if we set ˜u∞ = (u∞, a∞), then lims→∞ a∞(s, t) = +∞,
lims→∞ u∞(s, t) = x′(t) = x(t). Here, (s, t) ∈ R+ × S1 = Dǫ(y∞) \ {y∞}.

This implies that the induced orientation on x′(t) = x(t) form ˜u∞ is also
the same as the one given by λ. However, ˜u∞ ∪ ˜v∞ is the weak limit of ˜ui and
x(t) = x′(t) is the limit of some corresponding curves xi in ˜ui. Clearly, the

20

induced orientations of xi obtained from the two sides of ˜ui are opposite to each
other. This is a contradiction.

We remark that one can also get an alternative proof of above statement
by using gluing in [LT] and maximal principle instead of using this orientation
consideration.

This proves that |ai(yi)| is not bounded under the assumption that |yi| is
bounded. In the case that yi → ±∞, (R1 × S1; yi, 0, −∞, ∞) tends to a bound-

ary point of moduli space ¯M0,4. If, say, yi → ∞, let (S2; −∞, y∞, d)Wd=d′(S2, d′, 0, +∞)

be the limit curve. Then (R1 × S1; −∞, yi, 0, ∞) ≃ (S2#αi S2; −∞, y∞, 0, ∞)
for some αi ∈ C∗. Now in S2#αi S2, y∞ plays the same role yi in Σi but it stays
away from the two ends. The above argument is still applicable except that at
the limit, the domain has one more splitting.

Therefore, ai(yi) → ±∞. If ai(yi) → +∞, after shifting by −ai(yi) to the
target of ˜ui and deﬁne ˜wi = (ui, ai − ai(yi)), the above argument is still ap-
plicable to ˜wi, and we get bubble at y∞, still denoted by ˜v∞ = (v∞, b∞). In
particular, lims→∞ b∞(s, t) = +∞. Therefore, we get a bubble as before but

with target fM ′ lying on the right of fM with the end of the bubble approach-
ing a closed orbit lying on the right end of fM ′. As before, the orientation

consideration and maximum principal rule out this possibility.

Therefore, ai(yi) → −∞. Of course, we still can deﬁne ˜wi by the same
formula above. Arguing as before, we conclude that we still get a bubble from
{ ˜wi}∞

i=1, still denoted by ˜v∞, D∞ = D2 ∪ (R1 × S1) → fM ′. But the target
fM ′ lying on the left end of fM , and lims→∞ v∞(s, t) = x(t) in the right end
of fM ′. For simplicity, assume that there is no further splitting of the target.

(This follows form our assumption that there is only one bubble if we also count
”connecting bubbles”.) Then as before, ˜wi|Σi−{yi} is locally C∞- convergent to
˜w∞|R1×S1−{y∞} (again assume ﬁrst that |yi| < c and use deformation as before
to deal with general case), and along the end D(y∞) − {y∞} ≃ R1 × S1,

lim
s→∞

˜w∞(s, t) = x′(t) = x(t) ∈ fM− = fM ′

+.

To see that there is at least one more component of the domain in the

there exists si such that ˜ui|(−∞,si]×S1 lies on the ”left” of ˜ui(yi). Now ˜ui,−R =
˜ui|(si−R,si)×S1 is C∞-convergent to ˜u∞,−R after identifying (si − R, si) × S1

limit of [˜ui], we note that each ui connects x− ∈ fM− to x+ ∈ fM+, therefore,
with (−R, 0) × S1. We get ˜u∞,−∞ = ∪R ˜u∞,−R : (−∞, 0) × S1 → fM ′. We only
c = −RS1 x∗

need to show that for some R, ˜u∞,−R is not constant map. However, since ˜ui
asymptotically approximates to x− with exponential decay as s tends to −∞.
More precisely, we have |ai(s, t) − (cs + di)| < e−kis for some ki > 0. Note that
−λ 6= 0 is the same for all i. Therefore we can replace ˜u1(s, t) by
˜ui(s + si, t) with some very negative si such that |d˜ui|[0,R]×S1 | > ǫ > 0 for some
ﬁxed ǫ. Then the above limit ˜u∞,−∞ is not constant.

This proves the lemma. Note that the component ˜u∞,−∞ of the limit could
come from a closed orbit, i.e.
it is a trivial principal components. However,
in this case, there is a bubble component lying in the same component of the
target.

21

We remark that in the general case with multi-bubbling, the same proof
above proves that each of bubbles lie on some new component of targets which
lie on the left of the original ˜M . Moreover, there is at least one more principal
component lying on the the new ”left” component. In particular, in the ”new”
component of the target, where the ﬁrst top bubble lies on, there are at least
two connected components of the domain of the limit.

Remark 3.1 Some remark on the special role played by the marked point (yi, wi)
in the above lemma and some related issue is in order. Recall that yi is the point
where |du(yi)| → ∞ and wi is the point lying on the cirle of radius
|du(yi)| mea-
sured in the standard metric on R × S1. In the process of bubbling we bring
(yi, wi) into the standard point (0, 1) in S2. On one hand, the point wi will be
used to determine the side of bubbling at each stage, on the other, it will also
determine two marked lines on the two ends of Σ∞ joint at the double point of
Σ∞. Since the two components v∞ and u∞ of the limit approach to a closed
orbit {x}, these two marked lines will specify the base point 1 ∈ S1 and hence we
get a particular paremetrized x : S1 → M in {x}. However, in the bubbling one
can make arbitary choices for wi the the cirle. This implies that in the com-
pactiﬁcation below, we can use ﬁxed parametrized closed orbits as asymptotic
limit to which bubble components, and hence the adjecent principal components,
approach along their parametrized ends. On the otherhand, the diﬀerent S1-
paramerizations associated to each of such ends contributs an one dimensional
moduli to the domain of the limit stable map. An equivalent way to think about
this is to ﬁx an S1-parametrization for each of such ends of the limit curve.
Then we can not ﬁx the parametrizations of limit closed orbits anymore.

Note that in the case of splitting of principal components, as the maked lines
are already ﬁxed a priori, clearly, all elements in {x} may appear in the limit.

Remark 3.2 The proof of this lemma can be used the deduce some furth re-
strictions on the possible domains of stable maps, which appeared in the com-
pactiﬁction of M(x−, x+, J) (meaning as a limit of some sequence of elements
in M(x−, x+, J)). There are two general requirements. The ﬁrst one is that the
maximum principal for the a-component of the stable map must hold (as well as
the closed related orientation consideration should be incorperated). The second
is that there is no loop in the set of components of a domain. Applying these
two requirements to the case that there are two connected components of a sta-
ble map lying same component of the target with one ordinary double point joint
the two components of the domain, one conclude that each connected component
has at least one end lying on the positive end of the component of the target.
Starting from this, inductively one can prove that in the rightmost (positive)
component of the target, there are at least two closed orbits on the positive end
of the component of the target, which appeared as the asymptotic limits of the

22

stable map. However, the orintation consideration as in the proof of the last
lemma ( or the maximum principal plus gluing), implies that this is impossible.
Therefore, we conclude that all double points of a stable map in the com-
pactiﬁcation are ends. The same consideration also implies the following simple
picture one the structure of the components of a stable map appeared in the
compactiﬁcation. Starting from the leftmost component whose ”left” asympo-
totic end is x−, there exist one and only one end of this component, along
which the component approaches to a closed orbit x1 on the positive end M+,1
of component of the target. It is easy to see that all the other ends of the compo-
nents must lie on the negative end of the component of the target. In this case,
since we are already in the leftmost component, this is impossible. However, this
can happen in general case and we will use this to do induction in a moment.
If the next adjecent component lying on the adjecent component of the target,
we are in the same position as before and we can inductively go further. We
now show that this must be the case. Otherwise, the new component still stay in
the same component of the target, then the induced orientation on x1 from the
two adjecent components are the same, which is a contradiction. We conclude
that there is a chain of components ( should be called principal components ),
each lying on diﬀerent but adjecent components of the target and each connect-
ing two closed orbits on the two diﬀerent ends of the component of the target.
As mentioned above, for each of the principal components, all the other ends (if
there are any) must lie on the negative end of the component of the target by
maximum principle and gluing.

To get a complete picture, we need to know the behavior of those adjecent
components to those negative ends of, say, a typical principal component. The
orientation consideration implies that each of such components must lie in the
left adjecnt component to the component of the target, on which the principal
component lies. The maximum principle and gluing implies that the end at
which the principal component and the new adjecent component joint together
is the only positive end for the new component. Now we are in the position
of induction and we get a very simple structure on the components of a stable
map which appears as a limit map. Namely, each component of a stable limit
connecting map has only one positive end and possibly many negative ends with-
out any ordinary double points. Starting form the (only) rightmost end x+, all
components of the stable map form a tree pointed to negative a-direction.

It follows from this that for each intermediate closed orbit x, which appears

as an end of the limit stable map connecting x− and x+, R x∗λ is bounded above
by R x∗

−λ and ǫ, the lower bound
of the Eλ-energy of non-trival bubbles. This is used in the proof of Lemma 3.3.

To prove the compactness in general, as in the usual Gromov-Witten theory
or Floer homology, there are three steps (i) formation of all bubbles which lie
on the top of the bubble tree; (ii) local convergence of the sequence of {˜ui}∞
i=0
along the base, including splitting or degeneration of principal components;
(iii) formation of the intermediate bubbles and related ”zero bubbling” along
connecting necks. Most of analytic part of the proof for these are the analogy

to the symplectic case, except the two statments concerning the exponential
decay of a bubble along its non-removable singularity and and the behavior of
”connecting neck” along the non-compact R-direction, detailed in Sec.4. We
will only outline the those parts whose proof are similar to the symplectic case.
To do the step (i), we proceed inductively as in the usual symplectic case.
The proof of the above lemma serves as the staring point of the induction.
During the formtion of the ﬁrst bubble, the domain of ˜ui is deformed into
(Σi; y1
i are the maked points denoted by yi, wi in the pre-
vious lemma. But we think Σi as R1 × S1 with a small disc centered at yi
removed, then gluing back a portion of a cylinder, [0, Ri] × S1 with a half sphere
attached. In this model of (Σi; y1
i becomes the
standard points 0, 1 in the half sphere. Here Ri = 1
α and αi is the deformation
parameter in the Lemma before. The target ˜M originally has three marked
sections −∞, +∞, 0. We introduce a new marked section z1
i = ai(yi), where ai
is the second factor of ˜ui. As proved above, z1
i − 0| → ∞ as i → ∞.
We then check that if |d˜ui| measured in the induced metric in the new
deformed domain is uniformly bounded. Assume that is it not. Since the
injective radius of these new domains are bounded below, we can repeat the
process before to produce second bubble by introducing new marked points
i , w2
y2
in the taget which play the same
i
role as y1
i in the formation of the ﬁrst bubble. As each bubble has a
minimal amount of Eλ-energy bounded below, this process will stop after ﬁnite
steps. We end up with a deformed new domain (Σi; y1
i ) of
˜ui. As above, we think it as R1 ×S1 with k-small disc centered at yj
i , j = 1, · · · k
removed, then gluing back a portion of a cylinder, [0, Rj
i ] × S1 with a half
i , wj
i in (Σi; yj
sphere attached. As before the maked points yj
i ; j = 1, · · · , k),
becomes the standard points 0, 1 in these k-half spheres. The target ˜M of ˜ui
now has marked points −∞, +∞, 0, zj

Now |d˜ui| measured in the induced metric in the new deformed domain is
uniformly bounded. Let Dj
i,R, j = 1, · · · , k, be one of the k half spheres centered
at 0 = yj
i with a portion of a cylinder of length R attached in the deformed
domain Σi and Di,R be their union. We will use Bi,R to denote the subset of
Σi obtained by removing a small disc around each of those yj
i which produces a
”top” bubble, and then gluing back a cylinder of length R. Then for any ﬁxed
R, ˜ui|Di,R is C∞-convergent. By letting R → ∞, we obtained all top bubbles.
On the other hand, by restricting ˜ui to part of Bi,R of, say, length R and
shiftng the target with a suitable constant, we get the local convergence along
the ”base” after letting R tend to inﬁnity. Note that in the local convergence
of the base, the domain may splitting further into broken connecting maps. It
is possible that only one of the two ends of some component of such a broken
connecting map approaches to a cloed orbit, the other is just a double point.
Note also that during the process of these local convergenes and bubbling, the
target also gets split into severl components. For example in the case that
each of the distances between these k marked sections zj
i , j = 1, · · · , k tends to
inﬁnity, the target of the limit has at least k + 1 components. This essentially

24

ﬁnishes the ﬁrst two steps (i) and (ii).

It may happen that for some of Bi,R, the limt of the local convergence is
only a constant map. In oder to obtain a meaningful limit along the ”base”,
one has to show it is possible to get a sequence of consective non-trivial limit
connecting x− and x+. The key point to prove this is to observe that one can
have isoperemetric inequality and monetonicity lemma for each ˜ui projecting to
ξ in a small neighbourhood of each point of ˜M as in the usual symplectic case.
Now since each ˜ui connects x− and x+, and approaches to some of closed orbits
along the ends of the ”base”, its image projecting to ξ is not very small. This
implies that the non-trivial limit of above local convergence can be obtained.
The of the analogy argument in symplectic case is used to produce intermediate
bubbles, which can be found in [L?]. We refer the readers to the detail there
there, which can be easily adapted here.

To do the step(iii), we deﬁne the potential ”connecting bubble” Ci,R =
Σi \ Di,R ∪ Bi,R for ﬁxed R. Each componet C k
i,R of Ci,R is a sphere with
several small discs removed and cylinder attached, and connects the components
of Di,R and Bi,R. We may asssume that limR7→∞ limi7→∞ Eλ(˜ui|Ci) 6= 0. Then
we get those intermediate connecting bubbles by local convergence of ˜ui|C k
with R → ∞. As mentioned above isoperemetric inequality and monotonicity
lemma for ˜ui projecting to ξ can be used to produce non-trivial connecting
bubbles.

i,R

After this is done, we have limR7→∞ limi7→∞ Eλ(˜ui|Ti ) = 0, where Ti = Σ \
(Bi,R ∪ Di,R ∪ Ci), i.e. there is no Eλ-energy loss any more. We have got the
full limit of the sequence ˜ui along the compact direction. This is the projection
of the sequence to the contact manifold M is already weakly convergent to the
projection of the limit map so far obtained.

To get the full limit along the non-compact bf R-direction, we observe that
since there is no Eλ-energy loss anymore, given any two of ends of any of above
three parts, if presumely they should joint together in the domain acording the
above convergence scheme, but they apporach to two closed orbits which lie on
diﬀerent ends of the target ( maybe in the diﬀerent component of the target
also), then the two closed orbits are the same, and we get trivial connecting
map between them ( maybe passing through several components of the target)
as part of the limit. Note that only in the case there is already some non-trivail
component lying on some component of the target, we may have to introduce
this kind of trivial connecting maps in the component in order to get a connected
stable map. Therefore, the limit map so obtained is really a stable map deﬁned
before.

Finally, we note that in the next section we will prove that when R and i large
enough, each component T k
i ] ×
S1, is exponetially close to the trivial ˜J-holomrphic map coming from some
closed orbit x when T k

25

Theorem 3.2 The virtual co-dimension of the boundary components of M(x−, x+; J)
is at least one. In fact, the co-dimension of the stratum of broken connecting
˜J-holomorphic maps of two elements is one , and co-dimension of any stratum
whose elements contain bubble component is at least two.

proof
The proof of this theorem depends on the index formula, which will be proved

in [L3].

Let [˜u] be a typical element in the stratum. It is suﬃcient to consider the

follow two cases:

(i) The domain Σ of u is Σ1 ∪ Σ2 joint together at one of the ends of Σ1
and Σ2. Each Σi, i = 1, 2 is S2 with two marked points −∞ and +∞ treated
as ends, and we identify Σi \ {end} with S1 × R to give two marked lines on
Σ. The target U of ˜u is ˜M1 ∪ ˜M2 joint at one of their ends. ˜u1 connects a
closed orbit x−,1 on ˜M−,1 and another closed orbit x on ˜M+,1 = ˜M−,2, and ˜u2
connects the closed orbit x and another closed orbit x+,2 on ˜M+,2.

Note that x 6= x−,1 6= x+,2, and x 6= x+,2. There are ﬁve dimensional
symmetries for each element [˜u] is the above stratum, two dimension coming
from the R1-translations on each factor of the target and two dimensional R1-
translations on each factor of the domain together with an S1-action on the
domain. We will slice out the S1-action ﬁrst. Let ˜M(x−, {x}, {x+}; J) be the
moduli space of marametrized broken connecting ˜J-maps of two elements as
above. But we ﬁx a parametrized x− and alow x and x+ vary in their equivalent
classes. The dimension of the symmetry group of the moduli space is 4. It follows
from the index formula in [L3] that the dimension of ˜M(x−, {x}, {x+}; J) is
same as the dimension of ˜M(x−, {x+}; J) plus one, due to the one dimensional
possible choices of the element x ∈ {x}. Now a direct dimension counting
on the symmetries shows that in this case the codimension the the boundary
component of M(x−, x+; J) is one.

(ii) The second case corresponds to the case that there is only only one
bubbling as described in Lemma 3.4. There are two diﬀerent subcases: (1) both
of the principal components are non-trivial; (2) the ”new” principal components
is trivial. In the case (1), along the princial component, as parametrized map,
there are three diﬀerent possible parametrized closed orbits as asympotic limit
along ends, but is the case (2), there are only two of such closed orbits. On
the other hand, the dimension of the symmetry group of the two components
lying in the ”left” component of the target ( not counting the S1-action) is 6
in the case (1) and 5 in the case (2). Note that in the case (1) there are two
connected components in the ”new’ components of the target, while in the case
(2) there is only one according to our convention introduced before. Again index
formula in [L3] together with a direct dimension counting argument gives the
desire conclusion in this case.

4 Exponential Decay Estimate

We have proved a version of compactness theorem for the moduli space of stable
˜J-holomorphic maps in last section. The result is not quite completed for its
own ppurpose as well as for later applications. As we have shown before that
a sequence of ˜J-holomorphic maps may develop bubbles and split into broken
connecting ˜J-holomorphic maps. Unlike the usual Gromov-Floer theory, these
bubbles always have unremovable singularities. We showed before that along
the ends of singularities, the bubbles approach to some closed orbits. For the
purpose of moduli cycles in [L1], it is important to know the rate of the ˜J-
holomorphic maps approach to closed orbits either along their ends or along
the ends of the singularities of the bubbles. One of the main results of this
section is to prove that the rate of the approximation is exponential. When
dim M = 3, this is proved by Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder in [HZW]. When
M has an S1-symmetry, this is proved by Li-Ruan in [LiR]. We remark that
the extra assumption of [LiR] considerably simpliﬁed the analysis here. On the
other hand, the general case, even in dim M = 3, the argument in [HZW] is
quite involved. It turns out that the method of [HZW], suitably modiﬁed, can
be extended to the general case. We will carry out this generalization somewhere
else. In this section, we will give a more abstract and a simpler proof.

To motivate the second main result of this section, we note that one of the
important ingredients of the proof of compactness of the moduli space in the
usual Gromov-Floer theory is an explicit description about the behavior of the
”connecting neck” near bubble point.

In our case, it is necessary to know that the behavior of the ”connecting
necks” near the ”connecting” closed orbit when a family of ˜J-holomorphic maps
develop, say, a bubble approaching to the ”connecting” closed orbit, or split into
a broken ˜J- holomorphic maps of two elements joints at the closed orbit. More
precisely, if

is the ”neck” part of ˜ui such that the M -projection vi is close to the closed orbit

x(t) with c =RS1 x∗λ. We claim that ˜vi is essentially the same as the trivial map

(s, t) → (x(t), cs) ∈ M × R restricted to [−li, li] × S1. In particular, the length
of R1- projective of ˜vi diﬀers from 2c · li by at most a ﬁxed small constant. Note
that when i → ∞, li → ∞. It turns out that this statement plays an important
role in the compactness theorem. Recall that we have required that in the
deﬁnition of stable map, there is no unstable trivial connecting maps appeared
as components. The justiﬁcation of this is based on the above statement.

Let x(t) be a closed orbit. ˜u = (u, a), ˜w = (w, b) are two ˜J-holomorphic con-
necting maps: R1×S1 → ˜M such that lims→+∞ u(s, t) = x(t) = lims→−∞ w(s, t).
Assume that lims→−∞ u(s, t) = x−(t) and lims→+∞ w(s, t) = x+(t). Let ˜v∗
i =
i ) : R1 × S1 → ˜M be a sequence of ˜J- holomorphic maps connecting
(v∗
x−(t) and x+(t) and locally convergent to ˜u ∪ ˜w. Hence, lims→+∞ u(s, t) =
lims→−∞ w(s, t) = x(t) of some closed orbit. Note that the target ˜M of ˜u and
˜w should be thought as two diﬀerent spaces joint together at their ends. We

will only prove our results for this particular case. It is easy to see that the cor-
responding results for the case that ˜v∗ produces only one bubble can be proved
in an exactly the same way and the result for the general case can be obtained
by a simple combination of these two cases.

The assumption that ˜v∗

exist ni,j ∈ R, mi,j ∈ R, j = 1, 2 such that ˜v∗
convergent to ˜u(s, t) and v∗
for any compact subset of R1 × S1.

i is locally C∞-convergent to ˜u ∪ ˜w implies that there
n(s + ni,1, t) + (0, mi,1) is C∞-
i (s + ni,2, t) = (0, mi,2) is C∞-convergent to ˜v(s, t)

Now both {˜u(s + n, t)}∞

n=0 and {˜v(s − n, t)}∞

n=0 are locally C∞-convergent to
the trivial ˜J-holomorphic map (s, t) → (x(t), cs), after translations in ˜M . We
conclude that ∃N such that for any given ǫ > 0, when s > N , |Dα{u(s, t) −
x(t)}| < ǫ = ǫα and S < −N , |Dα{w(s, t) − x(t)}| < ǫ = ǫα for any |α| ≥ 0, and
that |Dα{a(s, t) − c ˙s}| < ǫ = ǫα, |Dα{b(s, t) − c ˙s}| < ǫ = ǫα for any |α| ≥ 1.

We now deﬁne ˜vi(s, t) = ˜v∗

Lemma 4.1 When i is large enough, for any s ∈ (−li, li), |Dα{vi(s, t) −
x(t)}| < 2ǫ, |α| ≥ 0 and |Dα{fi(s, t) − cs}| < 2ǫ, |α| ≥ 1.

proof
Since the proof of the two statements are similar, we will only prove the
ﬁrst one. Assume that the ﬁrst statement is not true.
then there exists a
sequence (si, ti) ∈ (−li, li) × S1, i → ∞, such that |Dα{vi(si, ti) − x(ti)}| >
2ǫ. If |si − (−li)| or |si − li| are bounded, say |si − (−li)| is bounded, then
vi(si + s, t), s ∈ (−δ, δ) is C∞-convergent to u(N + s, t) for some N > N and
s ∈ (−δ, δ), which implies that

|Dα{vi(si, t) − x(t)}| < 2ǫ

when i is large enough. This is a contradiction. Hence we may assume that
both |si − (−li)| and |si − li| → ∞.

Then ˜vi(si + s, t) is still C∞-convergent for any (s, t) ∈ [−R, R] × S1, with
ﬁxed R. Let R → ∞ and patch all the local limit together, we get a ˜J- holomor-
phic map ˜v∞ : R1×S1 → ˜M with Eλ(˜v∞) = 0. This implies that v∞(s, t) = x(t).
Therefore, |Dα(vi(si, t) − x(t))| < ǫ when i large enough. This is a contradiction
again.

QED

To state one of our main results, we deﬁne

˜vi,+(s, t) = (vi(s − li, t), fi(s − li, t) − f (−li, 0) + a(N, 0))

and

˜vi,−(s, t) = (vi(−s + li, t), fi(−s + li, t) − f (li, 0) + b(−N, 0)).

28

Then ˜vi,+(0, 0) → (u(N, 0), a(N, 0)), and ˜vi,−(0, 0) → (w(−N, 0), b(−N, 0)).

• Local Coordinate near x(t):

The λ-period of x(t) isRS1 x∗λdt = c. We have dx

dt = c ˙Xλ(α(t)). By rescaling
the parameter (s, t), we may assume that c = 1. Let τ be the minimal period
of x(t), i.e. τ > 0 is the minimal number such that x(t + τ ) = x(t). Under
this assumption, given any point z = x(t), t ∈ [0, τ ), we assign its θ-coordinate
θ = θ(z) = t. For simplicity, we will assume further that τ = 1. Hence θ ∈ S1 =
R/Z, and x(θ) = x(t), θ ∈ S1 is the simple closed orbit. Choose a global basis
{e1, · · · , e2n} for the symplectic bundle (ξ, dλ)|x(θ) such that the map

y = Σyiei(x(θ)) ∈ ξ → (θ, y1, · · · , y2n) ∈ (S1 × R2n, ω0)

gives rise a isomorphism between the two trivial symplectic bundles (ξ, dλ) and
(S1 ×R2n, ω0) over S1. The local coordinate of M near x(θ) is deﬁne by (y, θ) →
expx(θ)Σyiei, where y = (y1, · · · , y2n) ∈ R2n, θ ∈ S1. The exponential map is
taken with respect to the Riemanian metric g ˜J . Note that we may assume that
J|ξ|S1 corresponds to J0 under above iomorphism of the two symplectic bundles
over S1 = {x(θ)}.

Let U be a small tube neighborhood of x in M . With the above coordinate

the subscript u in yu and θu. Similarly, we write w(s, t) = (yw(s, t), θw(s, t))

Lemma 4.4 When s > N , |S(s, t) − S∞(s, t)| < C · ǫ and |Ss(s, t)| < C · ǫ for
the given ǫ and some constant C. Same conclusion for w and vi when s < −N
or s ∈ (−li, li) respectively.

Proof:

We only prove the statement for u.
When s > N ,

|Ds{u(s, t) − x(t)}| = |Ds{(y(s, t), θ(s, t)) − (0, t)}|

= |Ds(y(s, t), θ(s, t))| < ǫ.

Hence z0 = Ψ1(z0) is a ﬁxed point of Ψ1. Note that the ﬂow Ψt preserves the

Here we used that J is constant along ξ|x(t). Use equation (**), we get

ω(JDXλ(Ψt) ◦ DΨt(v), JDΨt(w)) + ω(JDΨt(v), JDXλ(Ψt) ◦ DΨt(v)) = 0.

Let vt = DΨt(v), wt = DΨt(w). Then

gJ (JDXλ(Ψt)(vt), wt) = gJ (vt, JDXλ(Ψt)(wt)).

Let t = 1, then Ψt(z) = z for any z = (0, θ). It is easy to see that

Since ˜w(0) = R(0)w(0) = w(0), we have ˜w(1) = w(1) = w(0), i.e. w(0) is
an eigenvalue of R(1) with eigenvalue 1. This implies that dΨ1(z0) has an
eigenvector of eigenvalue 1 along ξz0. Conversely, if v is an eigenvector of R(1)
with eigenvalue 1, then w(t) = R(t) · v solves (***) with w(1) = R(1) · v = v =

QED

For ˜u and ˜w, since s ∈ [N, +∞) or s ∈ (−∞, −N ], and g(s) → 0 as s →
±∞, the above lemma together with the usual elliptic estimate applied to each
[si, si + 1] × S1 implies that

Lemma 4.8 The y-component y(s, t) of ˜u satisﬁes:

s > N.

Moreover, there exists a constant C = Cα, with |α| ≥ 0, such that

|Dαy(s, t)| < Cα · e−δ(s−N ).

Similar conclusion holds for ˜w.

To get corresponding estimate for ˜vi, we note that since lims→+∞ yu(s, t) =
0 = lim yw(s, t), we may assume that kyu(N )kL2 = kyw(−N )kL2. This implies
that kyvi(−li)kL2 is very close to kyvi(li)kL2, when i large enough. For simplic-
ity, we may assume that c+ = g(li) = kyvi(li)k2 = kyvi(−li)k2 = g(−li) = c−.
Let c = c+ = c−, and denote li by l. Deﬁne h(s) = a · (e−δs + eδs), with
a =

e−δl+eδl . Then h(−l) = h(l) = c, and h′′(s) = δ2h(s).
Deﬁne f = g − h. Then f ′′(s) ≥ δ2 · f (s), for s ∈ (−l, l) and f (−l) =
f (l) = 0. The maximal principle implies that f (s) ≤ 0, s ∈ (−l, l). Hence g(s) ≤
c·(e−δs+eδs)

c

e−δl+eδl

.

Now deﬁne g+(s) = g(s − l), and g−(s) = g(l − s), s ∈ (0, l). Then

Similarly, gs(s) ≤ 2c−e−δs.
Note that since c+, c− are close to kyu(N )k2

L2 which are
ﬁxed, we get exponential decay of g+(s) and g−(s). For the general case when

s ∈ (0, li).

Moreover, ∃C = Cα, |α| ≥ 0 such that

|Dαy±(s, t)| < C · e−δs,

s ∈ (0, li).

We now study the behavior of the (a, θ)-component of ˜u, ˜w and ˜vi.
We have shown before that when s > N or s < −N , for u and w, and
s ∈ (−li, li) for vi, |D(u(s, t) − x(t))| < ǫ. Since |Dy(s, t)| < ǫ, this implies that
|∂tθ − 1| = |∂tθ − ∂tx(t)| < ǫ and |∂sθ| = |∂sθ − ∂s(x(t))| < ǫ. Let P : U ⊂
M → R1 × S1 = {(a, θ)} be the projection of the (a, y, θ)-coordinate chart U
to (a, θ)-coordinate chart R1 × S1 given by (a, y, θ) → (a, θ). Then u = P ◦ ˜u,
w = P ◦ ˜w and vi = P ◦ ˜vi are local diﬀeomorphisms from [−N, +∞) × S1,
(−∞, −N ] × S1 and (−li, li) × S1 to R1 × S1. Since

|∂sa(s, t) − 1| = |∂s(a(s, t) − cs)| < ǫ

|∂ta(s, t)| < ǫ for these values of s in the above range

|a(s, t) − a(s0, t0)| ≥ |a(s, t) − a(s0, t)| − |a(s0, t) − a(s0, t0)|

|s − s0| − ǫ.

This implies that u, w and vi are proper.. Hence they are covering maps
from open cylinders (N, +∞) × S1, (−∞, −N ) or (−li, li) × S1 to their images
in R × S1. Assume that the degree of the covering is m.

Let πm : R × S1 → R × S1 be the standard m-fold covering induced from the
corresponding covering of S1 to S1. Write u, w and vi as (a, θ). We will study
vi ﬁrst. We will only derive the equation for vi = (a, θ). The same formula is
also applicable for u and w.

Let q0 = vi(−li, 0) = (a0, θ0) and ˜q0 = (a0, ˜θ0) ∈ π−1

m (q0) with ˜θ0 ∈ [0, 1)
being the smallest of such ˜θ0. Deﬁne V i to be the unique lifting of vi sending
(−li, 0) to ˜q0. We drop the subscript of V i from now on. Then V : (−li, li) ×
S1 → R×S1 is an embedding. Note that the length of the image of a-projection
of V ({li} × S1) and V ({li}) × S1) is less than ǫ. Hence the image of V in R × S1
is almost a standard cylinder of the form [0, L] × S1. We want to prove that
|L − 2li| is uniformly bounded and tends to zero when i and N tends to inﬁnity.

36

Since πm preserves a-length, this also implies the corresponding statement for
vi.

To this end, deﬁne the complex structure i = i(s, t) on the image of V by

the identiﬁcation:

i(s, t) = dV (s, t) ◦ i ◦ {dV (s, t)}−1 : TV (s,t)(R1 × S1) → TV (s,t)(R1 × S1).

Then V is (i, i)-holomorphic, i.e.

dV ◦ i = i(V ) · dV .

Switch to vi,+ or vi,− and consider the corresponding vi,+, vi,− and V +, V − and
associated i(s, t). By abusing our notations, we will still use i(s, t) to denote the
complex structure in these cases.

Lemma 4.10 For s ∈ (−li, li), there exists a constant C = Cα independent of
i, such that |Dα(i(s, t) − i)| < Cα · e−δs.

Proof:

Since πm is a local diﬀeomorphism, if we deﬁne I = I(s, t) : Tv(s,t)(R1 ×
S1) → Tv(s,t)(R1 × S1) by the formula: dv(s, t) ◦ i ◦ {dv(s, t)}−1, then i(s, t) =
dπ−1
m ◦ I(s, t) ◦ dπm. Therefore, we only need to prove the corresponding state-
ment for I(s, t). Now v is (i, I)- holomorphic, i.e. dv(s, t) ◦ i = I(s, t) ◦ dv(s, t).

Still work with ˜vi,+ and the corresponding V . Now V : (0, li)×S1 → R1×S1.
By R-translation, we may assume that V (0, 0) = (0, θ0). Note that θ0 → 0 when

of (0, li) × S1 to the universal covering R1 × R1 of R1 × S1, which sends (0, 0)
to (0, θ0), 0 ≤ θ0 ≤ 1. We still denote it by V . Then (V − Id) : (0, li) × R1 →
R1 ×R1, and since both V and Id commutes with deck transformations induced
by θ → θ + 1,, V − Id is periodic on the second factor of (0, li) × R1 of period

We reamrk that this proposition is the precise statement we mentioned before
on the behavior of the ”connecting neck” along the non-compact a- direction,
which is used in the previous section to justify why it is possible to get the
compactiﬁcation of the moduli space without introducing the unstable trivial
connecting maps.

For ˜u and ˜w, we get more. We only prove the result for ˜u. Deﬁne u, U and

We conclude that g(s) ≤ C1 · e−δ(s−N ). As before, applying elliptic estimate

|Dαy(s, t)| < Cα · e−δs,
|Dα{(a(s, t), θ(s, t)) − (cs + d1, ct + d2)}| < Cα · e−δs

for some suitable constants d1 ∈ R and d2 ∈ (0, τ ), where τ is the minimal
period of x(t).

5 Some possible applications

The following are some immediate possible applications. Here we will only
brieﬂy indicate the reasons for these applications and refer the reader to the
forth coming papers on each of these topics.

• (A) Index homology in contact geometry:
We have already outlined the index homology in contact geometry by using
the moduli space of connecting pseudo-holomorphic maps. Note that the moduli
space of connecting maps used here has an one dimensional symmetry of S1-
rotations. At the same time, their asymptotic ends of closed orbits also have the
S1-symmetry. It is possible to remove the symmetry by using the connecting
˜J = ˜Jt, t ∈ S1 holomorphic maps with t dependent ˜J. This will lead to a special
Bott-type index homology, even the contact structure is generic.

• (B) Additive quantum homology in contact geometry:
The index homology we deﬁned is an analogy of the usual Floer homology in
symplectic geometry. We now outline a quantum homology in contact geometry
by a diﬀerent way to use the moduli space.

Let Ma ⊂ ˜M = M × R1 be the section M × {a} in ˜M . Given any sin-
gular chain α in M = Ma consider the moduli space ˜M(x−, x+; α, Ma)/S1,
which is a subset of ˜M(x−, x+)/S1 whose element u satisﬁes the condition
that u(z0) ∈ α(∈ Ma). Now consider another marked point z1 in u lying on
a ﬁxed marked line and deﬁne the obvious evaluation map eα = eα;a,b,z1 :
˜M(x−, x+; α, Ma)/S1 → Mb. Note that each element u with the two
∪x−,x+
marked points without any non-compact symmetry anymore.

The intuition here is that by letting a being very negative, and b very pos-
itive, we ﬂow the singular chain α lying almost in the negative end to get a
collection of singular chains almost in the positive end.

We now deﬁne additive quantum homology by deﬁning the chain complex
generated by singular chains α in M with the boundary D(α) = ∂(α)±eα, where
∂(α) is just the usual boundary map of singular homology. By the property of
the moduli space established in this paper and [L1], we have D2 = 0. One can
show that the homology so deﬁned is independent of the choices involved and
is an invariant of M .

• (C) Gromov-Witten invariants in contact geometry and ring

structure in the index cohomology :

Whence the index homology is deﬁned, we can deﬁne G-W invariant in
exact the same fashion as the G-W invariant in the usual quantum homology
and Floer homology. Namely given closed orbits x− = (x1,−, · · · , xk,−) and
x+ = (x1,+, · · · , xl,+), we deﬁne G-W invariant Ψk,l(x−, x+) by counting J-
homomorphic map u in ˜M from the domain S2 with k + l punctures such that
along k negative ends u approaches to x− and along l positive ends u approaches
to x+.

As in the usual GW-invariant in quantum and Floer homology, one can show

that the invariant so deﬁned at chain level descends to the homology.

By using the invariant Ψ2,1, one can deﬁne a ring structure in the index

41

cohomology, which can be thought as a quantum product for the contact man-
ifold.

One can also extend to deﬁnition of G-W invariants by introducing another
set of marked points z = (z1, · · · , zn), zi ∈ S2, and require that u(zi) ∈ Ci of
some prescribed cycles in ˜M .

Using the special case of three marked point invariants with only one z, we
get an action of H∗(M ) on the index homology, i.e. the index homology is a
module over H∗(M ).

There are obvious generalization of theses constructions, such as higher genus

G-W invariants, coupling with gravity and so on.

Note that the product structure should be thought as an essential part of the
structure of these index homologies as there are many cases where the additive
index homology is inﬁnitely generated.

• (D) Relative quantum homology:
Give a compact symplectic manifold (P, ω) with a contact boundary, let the
boundary be M with the compatible contact structure λ = iX ω, where X is the
contact ﬁeld i.e. LX ω = ω. We now glue ˜M to P along the boundary. By using
a suitable choice of φ mentioned before, we get a new symplectic manifold with
a cylindrical end.

The chain complex of the quantum homology of a symplectic manifold P
with contact boundary M is generated by the pair (α, β) where α is a singular
chain in P and β is a singular chain in ˜M . The boundary operator D = (D1, D2).
Here D2(β) is deﬁned same as the one in (A) above. D1(α) = ∂(α) ± eα. The
deﬁnition of eα here is also similar to the one in (B). But we use the moduli space
of J-holomorphic maps, the domain of whose elements is C being treated as a
half sphere with an half inﬁnite cylinder attached, to ﬂow the singular chain α
in P to get a collection of singular chains eα in M . Again we have D2 = 0. Now
there is an obvious embedding of the chain complex of the quantum homology
of M deﬁned in (B) to the chain complex we just deﬁned. We deﬁne the chain
complex of the relative quantum homology as the quotient of this pair.

Note that unlike (B) above, in the case that the contact boundary M of P
is concave, we may not be able to get a desired uniform energy bound. In this
case we need some extra assumption such as ω is exact.

Note that there are some obvious algebraic constructions related to these
chain complexes, such as the induced long exact sequences related these three
homologies and Mayer-Vietoris sequence of these homologies. More general,
assume that we can decompose a compact symplectic manifold in sequence of
increasing symplectic sub-manifolds with (convex) contact type boundaries, we
can associate the sequence a ﬁltration of chain complexes deﬁned above. Then
there is a associated spectral sequence associated to the ﬁltration.

It is an interesting question to study further these algebriac constructions
to incorperate the multiplicative structures and to study their relation to the
quantum homology of a symplectic manifold. It seems that this will give a new
way to compute quantum homology of a symplectic manifold.

• (E) Bott-type index homology, S1-invariant contact manifold and

Weinstein conjecture:

42

We have assumed so far that the contact form λ is generic so that the set
of closed orbits is discrete. We can relax this condition by only requiring that
λ is of Bott-type. Then the set of closed orbits decomposes into an union
of diﬀerent components, each being a manifold. Note that the period of any
element in a component is the same by Stokes theorem. In the symplectic case,
in this situation, Ruan and Tian developed a Bott-type Floer homology. One
can develop a similar construction in this case. As remarked in A, we have two
diﬀerent versions of the Bott-type homology.

One of our motivation to consider Bott-type index homology is to answer

the question that if the index homology so deﬁned is always trivial.

By using the Bott-type index homology, one can compute the index ho-
mology when the contact manifold appears as a regular zero locus of a local
Hamiltonian function on some symplectic manifold, which generates a local S1-
action.

For simplicity, let (P, ω) be a compact symplectic manifold with a S1 Hamil-
tonian action generated by a Hamiltonian function H. Assume that a is a regular
value of H. Let P a = H −1(a) and Pa = P a/S1. Under some assumption, P a
is a contact manifold whose contact structure is speciﬁed by ω. In fact the con-
tact structure on P a can be chosen to be S1-invariant. We deﬁne a S1-invariant
contact form as follows. Note that P (a−ǫ,a+ǫ) is a S1 bundle over P(a−ǫ,a+ǫ),
where P (a−ǫ,a+ǫ) = H −1((a − ǫ, a + ǫ)) and P(a−ǫ,a+ǫ) = H −1((a − ǫ, a + ǫ))/S1.
Chose a connection. We can lift any vector ﬁeld X, which is transversal to Pa
in P(a−ǫ,a+ǫ) to an S1-equivariant vector ﬁeld ˜X. We deﬁne the S1-invariant
contact form λ = i ˜X ω. By adjusting X, we may assume that λ(XH ) = 1. That
is λ the connection 1-form for the S1-bundle. Hence, λ is a contact form if the
curvature dλ is positive. Now the set of closed orbits of the contact manifold
(P a, λ) of period 1 is just Pa and the images of these closed orbits foliated P a
itself. All other components of the set of closed orbits are just copies of this
one according to diﬀerent periods. We are in the situation of Bott-type index
homology. The chain complex of Bott-type homology is generated by singular
chains in some components of the set of closed orbits and the boundary map
is the combination of the usual boundary map for singular homology together
with a ”connecting” map by using the connecting J-holomorphic maps between
two components of the set of closed orbits to ﬂow the singular chain. In our
case, due to the extra S1-symmetry in the moduli space of J-connecting maps,
the second part, the part of the ”connecting” map, of the boundary map has
no contribution. Hence, the Bott-type index homology is just inﬁnitely many
copies of the usual homology of the symplectic quotient Pa.
In view of the
invariance of Bott-type index homology, this also compute the index homology
for the contact structure. In particular, we proved the non-vanishing of index
homology in this case.

As a corollary, we proved Weinstein conjecture for this case.
It would be interesting to study the relationship of the product structure
in the contact manifold P a with the quantum homology of its quotient, the
symplectic manifold Pa.

43

• (F) Gluing formula for G-W invariants:
Give a compact symplectic manifold (P, ω), assume that there is a contact
type hypersurface M ⊂ P such that M cuts P into two pieces P− and P+ with
the common boundary M . As in (D), we can glue ˜M to each of P− and P+ to
form two non-compact symplectic manifolds P − and P + with cylindrical ends.
As in [LR], we can prove a gluing formula for G-W invariants, which relates the
G-W invariants of P with the G-W invariants in P +, P − and ˜M .

The idea is the following:
One ﬁrst collect all J-holomorphic map u in P +, P − or ˜M with the property
that u approaches to some of closed orbits lying on the ends of P +, P − or ˜M
along its punctures, then select among them those u can be glued along those
closed orbits.

Note that unlike in [LR], we do not require any local S1 Hamiltonian action.
• (G) Low dimensional contact manifold A special feature of a three
dimensional compact manifold is that it always has a contact structure. Hence
the index homology and additive quantum homology is well-deﬁned associated to
the contact structure. It would be very interesting to investigate if the invariants
we deﬁned here are actually topological invariants. There are various diﬀerent
forms of this type of questions. In view of the work of Taubes on the relationship
of the SW-invariants and GW-invariants, one may hope to get similar results for
contact 3-fold and symplectic four manifold with contact type boundary. Our
result should serve as one of the basis to formulate this type of results.

We make the following ﬁnal remark. As we mentioned before, one of the main
results of this paper and [L3] is about the virtual co-dimension of the boundary
of the moduli space, which is the foundation of the applications outlined in this
section. This result is the consequence of the compactness theorem proved in
this paper and the index formula, which will be proved in [L3]. To obtain the
result, the index formula we need here is diﬀerent from the usual one appeared
in Bott-type Floer homology due to the extra dimension of the asymptotic R1-
motion of a connecting pseudo-holomorphic maps along the ends (closed orbits).
On the other hand, the main body of this paper, the proof of the compact-
ness theorem, is independent of the desired index formula.
In fact, the new
phenomenon appeared in the bubbling described in Lemma 3.4 and the Deﬁni-
tion 4.1 on equivalence of stable maps concerning how to count symmetries in
target already opens the door for various possible applications.

INTRODUCTION

A clear, concise formulation of the general solution for maximal horizontal range of the

projectile motion is considered non-trivial. Consequently much eﬀort has been spent to

formulate a solution that would be understandable to as wide audience as possible. The

problem may be stated as follows:

Find the maximal horizontal range, R, of a projectile launched with an initial speed v0

from the point with the vertical coordinate y0. (Figure 1)

Generally the known solutions are divided into those that do and those that do not

make use of calculus. Somewhat misleadingly the former are commonly qualiﬁed as simple.

The categorization according to whether a solution starts from the vector or scalar general

solution of projectile motion seems more appropriate.

In the former one starts from

~gt2

~r = ~r0 + ~v0t +

~v = ~v0 + ~gt

and employs “ingenious application of vector algebra, involving both dot and cross products”

(citation from Thomsen [1]). An example of a solution from this category is given by Palfy-

Muhoray and Balzarini [2]. While it does not involve calculus the solution can hardly

be considered simple. The use of vector algebra as the means for the solution seems to

be be inspired by the paper of Winans [3] who provided a solution by using quaternion

In the latter approach one starts from the more familiar parametric representation of the

multiplication.

The calculus-based solutions (e.g. [4, 5]) proceed with the substitutions,

and look for the maximum of the resulting function R = R(θ) by setting

x = v0t cos θ

y = y0 + v0t sin θ −

While the method is straightforward and therefore may be considered simple, the function

(5) is quite complicated and the application of the necessary condition for the extremum of

a function of one variable (4) leads to a very involving calculation. This may be the main

reason to look for the solutions that do not involve calculus.

The substitutions (3) accompanied with the use of the trigonometric identity

which is the basis for a couple of interesting non-calculus-based solutions. Thomsen [1], for

example, considers Equation (7) as a quadratic equation in tan θ. The requirement that the

solutions of the equation be real then leads to a solution of the problem. Ba´ce et al.[6] take

the same view of Equation (7) but obtain the solution through a more pointed observation

that the maximal horizontal range, Rmax, is realized for the unique initial direction of the

Some additional solutions are discussed in Brown [7], who also gives his own, non-calculus-

based solution based on the solution of a related problem of the range of a projectile launched

down an incline.

II. CHANGE OF VARIABLE SOLUTION

Instead of focusing on some explicit relation between the relevant variables, e.g. R = R(θ)
or R = R(t), one can notice that the Equation (7) can be cast in the form where R2 is

expressed as a quadratic function of R tan θ,

R2 = −(R tan θ)2 + 2

This observation makes both, calculus-based and purely algebraic, solutions simple.

Equation (8) then gives

which in turn, inserted into Equation (10), leads to

This completes the solution.

III. CONCLUSION

The present solution of the problem of maximizing the horizontal range of the projectile

motion is based on the widely applicable technique of change of variables. Although this may

be implicit in the algebraic variant of the solution, both variants may serve as an illustration

of the usefulness of the technique in simplifying otherwise complicated calculations.

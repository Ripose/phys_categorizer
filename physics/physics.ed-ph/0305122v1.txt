Abstract

It is shown that, in spite of the appearances, the standard expression for the
oscillation probability of ultrarelativistic neutrinos is Lorentz invariant.

Flavor is the quantum number that distinguishes the diﬀerent types of quarks and leptons.
It is a Lorentz-invariant quantity. For example, an electron is seen as an electron by any
observer, never as a muon. Therefore, the probability of ﬂavor neutrino oscillations must
be Lorentz invariant (as already remarked in Ref. [1]). However, it may appear that the
standard expression for the probability of να → νβ transitions in vacuum1,

is not Lorentz invariant. In Eq. (1) U is the mixing matrix that connects the ﬂavor neutrino
ﬁelds να (α = e, µ, τ ) with the massive neutrino ﬁelds νk (k = 1, 2, 3)2, L is the distance
between the neutrino source and the neutrino detector, and E is the neutrino energy (see
Refs. [2, 3]). In Eq. (2) ∆m2
j is the diﬀerence between the squared-masses of νk
and νj.

Let us assume that Eq. (1) is valid in the inertial system O with time axis t and the x axis
in the direction of neutrino propagation. Consider another inertial system O′ with axes x′, t′
moving with respect to O with velocity v in the x direction. The Lorentz transformations

This is the well-known Lorentz contraction of distances. The Lorentz-contracted distance

It is clear that if the values of L′ and E′ in Eqs. (5) and (7) were correct for the calcu-
lation of the oscillation probability in the system O′, the resulting oscillation probability
Pνα→νβ (E′, L′) would be diﬀerent from Pνα→νβ (E, L), leading to an absurd violation of the
Lorentz invariance of ﬂavor.

A possible objection to this reasoning is that the phase diﬀerences in Eq. (2) are valid
only in the reference frame in which the source and detector are at rest. The answer to this
objection is that the expression in Eq. (2) is derived without any assumption of a special
reference frame, and hence it must be valid in any frame. Indeed, the phase diﬀerences in
Eq. (2) follow from a simple relativistic approximation of the explicitly Lorentz invariant
phases

φk(T, L) = Ek T − pk L ,

where T is the time of propagation of the neutrino from the source to the detector, Ek and
pk are the energy and momentum of νk. For T = L, corresponding to the leading order
contribution to the phase of ultrarelativistic neutrinos (see Ref. [1]), we have

in Eq. (2). From this simple derivation in which we did not make any assumption on the
reference frame, it is clear that the phases (9) and the phase diﬀerences (2) are valid in any
frame and should be Lorentz invariant as the phase (8) from which they are derived.

The above derivation helps in understanding the solution of the problem: the crucial point
is the approximation T = L, which means that L is not the equal-time distance between
source and detector, but the distance traveled by the neutrino in the time T . In other words,
in any system L is the spatial distance between the space-time events of neutrino production
and detection.

If in the system O we have ∆x = ∆t, from Eqs.(3) in the system O′ we have

Therefore, the correct transformation for the distance in the phases is not given by the
Lorentz contraction formula in Eq. (5), but by

∆x′ = ∆t′ = γ (1 − v) ∆x .

L′ = γ (1 − v) L .

(11)

Confronting this expression with the transformation of energy in Eq. (7), it is clear that
the ratio L/E is Lorentz invariant, as well as the phases in Eqs. (9) and (2), and the ﬂavor
transition probability in Eq. (1).

A simple example can show clearly that the Lorentz-contracted source-detector distance
(5) calculated at equal times in the system O′ does not correspond to the distance traveled
by the neutrino. Consider the source and detector at rest in the system O. Then in the
system O′ the detector is moving with velocity −v along the x axis. Since the detector
moves after the propagating neutrino has left the source, the spatial distance traveled by the
neutrino is shorter than the instantaneous source-detector distance.

The correct transformation law of the propagation distance in Eq. (11) is illustrated by
the Minkowski diagram in Fig. 1, in which one can clearly see that in a system in which source
and detector are in motion the spatial distance between the two space-time events of neutrino
production and detection is diﬀerent from the instantaneous source-detector distance. The
two distances coincide only in the system O, in which source and detector are at rest.

Finally, one can ask what happens if instead of considering the source and detector at
rest in the system O, we consider a case in which source and detector are in relative motion.
Since the oscillation probability is measured by the detector, the velocity of the source with
respect to the detector does not matter4. The system O in which the distance L covered by
the neutrino coincides with the instantaneous distance between source and detector at the
time of neutrino emission is always the rest system of the detector. In Fig. 1 the world-line
of the detector is constrained to be the vertical line passing through the space-time event
D of neutrino detection, but the world-line of the source can be any time-like line passing
through the space-time event P of neutrino production.

4Of course, the velocity of the source must be taken into account in the calculation of the neutrino energy.

For example, if the source is a decaying pion, the neutrino energy depends on the velocity of the pion.

Gauge Invariance and Canonical Variables

Abstract

We discuss some paradoxes arising due to the gauge-dependence

of canonical variables in mechanics.

1. Rather elementary problems discussed in this note originate partly
from tutorials on quantum mechanics at the Novosibirsk University, partly
from discussions on elementary particle physics and quantum ﬁeld theory
with our colleagues. These problems turned out diﬃcult not only for un-
dergraduates. To our surprise, they caused confusion even of some educated
theorists. So, hopefully, a short note on the subject will be useful, at least
from the methodological point of view, so much the more that we are not
aware of any explicit discussion of the matter in literature.

Though the questions have arisen in quantum mechanics or even in more
elevated subjects, they belong in essence to classical mechanics. Just to
classical mechanics we conﬁne mainly in the present note.

2. Let us consider the simple problem of a charged particle in a constant

homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. Its Hamiltonian is well-known:

H =

1
2m (cid:18)

p −

A

(cid:19)

.

It is also well-known that various gauges are possible for the vector potential
A. With the magnetic ﬁeld B directed along the z axis, one can choose, for
instance,

A = B(0, x, 0).

In this gauge the Hamiltonian is independent of y, and therefore the corre-
sponding component py of the canonical momentum is an integral of motion.
However, one can choose equally well another gauge:

A = B(−y, 0, 0).

Then it is the component px of the canonical momentum which is conserved.
But how it comes that a component of p transverse to the magnetic
ﬁeld can be conserved, and that, moreover, the conserved component can be
chosen at will? The obvious answer is that the canonical momentum p is not
a gauge-invariant quantity and therefore has no direct physical meaning. As
to our visual picture of the transverse motion in a magnetic ﬁeld, it is not
the canonical momentum p which precesses and thus permanently changes
its direction, but the velocity

v =

1
m (cid:18)

p −

e
c

A

.

(cid:19)

As distinct from the canonical momentum p, the velocity v is a gauge-
invariant and physically uniquely deﬁned quantity.

3. It is only natural that not only the space components p of the canonical
momentum, but as well its time component, the Hamiltonian H, is gauge-
dependent. It is the kinetic energy H − eA0 which is gauge-invariant.

As a rather striking manifestation of this fact, let us consider an example
of a well-known physical system whose energy is conserved, but the Hamil-
tonian can be time-dependent. We mean the motion of a charged particle in
a time-independent electric ﬁeld E, for instance, in the Coulomb one. Let us
choose here the gauge A0 = 0. In it the vector potential becomes obviously

A = −ctE,

so that now the Hamiltonian (1) depends on time explicitly. Nevertheless, the
energy of a particle in a time-independent electromagnetic ﬁeld is certainly
conserved. Indeed, here the equations of motion become

˙r = {H, r} =

(p + e t E),

1
m

m ¨r =

(p + e t E) = {H, p + e t E} = e E

d
dt

(5)

(we use the Poisson brackets {..., ...} in these classical equations). Since
for a time-independent electric ﬁeld its strength can be always written as a
gradient of a scalar function: E = −∇ϕ, equation (5) has ﬁrst integral

m ˙r2 + e ϕ = const ,

which is obviously nothing but the integral of energy. On the other hand, in
virtue of equation (4), the Hamiltonian in the gauge A0 = 0 coincides in fact
with the kinetic energy:

H =

(p + e t E)2 =

m ˙r2 .

1
2m

It looks quite natural: the kinetic energy H − eA0, being gauge-invariant,
should coincide with the Hamiltonian in the gauge A0 = 0.

At last, an obvious comment on the situation in quantum mechanics.
Though the Hamiltonian is not gauge-invariant, the Schr¨odinger equation
Its gauge invariance is saved by the gauge transformation of the wave
is.
In particular, in the gauge A0 = 0 the time-dependence of the
function.
Hamiltonian results only in some extra time-dependent phase for the wave
function.

Abstract

We demonstrate that an eﬀect other than anharmonicity can severely distort the spectroscopic

signatures of quantum mechanical systems. This is done through an analytic calculation of the

spectroscopic response of a simple system, a charged torsional pendulum. One may look for these

eﬀects in the optical data of real systems when for example a signiﬁcant rocking component of rigid

polyhedra plays a signiﬁcant role in the lattice dynamics.

FIG. 1: (a) A torsional pendulum. (b) A realization of an analogous quantum mechanical system.

In a typical spectroscopic experiment, electromagnetic radiation couples to the charge

degrees of freedom of a system whose underlying dynamical behavior is described by a

Hamiltonian.

In many cases, the behavior of a system near a stable equilibrium can be

adequately described by a simple harmonic Hamiltonian, a choice that is often well justiﬁed

as an expansion in some suitably chosen coordinate about a minimum of a more compli-

cated potential. The potential expansion coordinates are often chosen to be one or more

of the Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z, such as is done in the quantum theory of lattice

vibrations[1].

The coupling of radiation to matter also involves matrix elements of the Cartesian vari-

ables and as a result, selection rules arise which forbid optical transitions between vibrational

levels which are not adjacent in energy. The eﬀect on spectroscopy is to produce a single

peak in the system response at the oscillator’s fundamental frequency. The symmetry for-

bidding the transitions to higher energy levels is imposed by the initial choice of Cartesian

expansion coordinate, a choice that in certain situations could be improved upon toward de-

scribing the system dynamics. An example of the latter is a system with inherent curvilinear

geometrical constraints.

In this manuscript, we show that for a simple and familiar model system where curvilinear

motion is inherent, profound eﬀects on the spectroscopic response functions are realized. We

exemplify this principle by studying the dynamical response of a torsional pendulum with

charge degrees of freedom.

The quantum mechanical problem which is analogous to the classical torsional pendulum

is shown in Figure 1b. This situation corresponds to a situation where 360◦ rotations of the

2

particle wavefunction produces a distinct state, which cannot interfere with the unrotated

state. The “particle on a pig’s tail” system shown in Figure 1 is can be viewed as a 1D

harmonic oscillator wrapped many times around a cylinder. We proceed to investigate the

spectroscopic response functions of this harmonic system.

The Hamiltonian is

H =

+

Iω2

0θ2

L2
2I

where I is the moment of inertia and ω0 is the resonant frequency of the pendulum. The

angular momentum operator L is conjugate to the (unbounded) angular coordinate θ, and

the Hamiltonian describes a harmonic oscillator.

We exploit extensively Dirac’s factorization procedure in order to ﬁnd the current-current

correlation function, and hence the linear response of this model system. The Hamiltonian

in quantized form is:

The current operator j in this formula is the time derivative of the polarization operator,
j = ∂P

In a 1D Cartesian harmonic oscillator, P connects only those states

∂t = i

adjacent in energy, so that at zero temperature, only the

transition would be

observed, giving a single delta function peak at the oscillator’s natural frequency[5].

In the torsional oscillator, the polarization operator is a nontrivial function of the angle

θ, which appears quadratically in the Hamiltonian. This nonlinear dependence of the ma-

trix element on the harmonic degree of freedom will permit transitions between states not

adjacent in energy. The main eﬀect of this for spectroscopy is that the conductivity will be

a series of peaks at integral multiples of the resonant frequency. We will demonstrate this

eﬀect below by calculating the spectroscopic matrix elements for this system.

We see that the transitions between the ground and excited states are allowed for all

excited states in the torsional pendulum, and the distribution of intensities is crucially

determined by the angular uncertainty. In the “stiﬀ pendulum” limit, ω0 is large and c

nearly sinusoidal oscillations for t > 0. Loosening the pendulum (and increasing the angular

uncertainty ∆θ) eﬀects these dynamics considerably.

While the considerations spelled out here are rather idealized, a reasonable place to seek

the multiple peak eﬀect in a real system could be the vibrational spectra of nanotubes. When

a chiral nanotube is formed from a graphene sheet, phonons propagating along the graphene

lattice basis vectors form a twisting pattern around the nanotube axis. The geometry

associated with these vibrational degrees of freedom bear similarities to that of Figure 1b.

It is feasible that another realization of this eﬀect could be found in solids which support

very soft librational phonon modes.

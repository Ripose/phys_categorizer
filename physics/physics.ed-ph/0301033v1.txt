Abstract

We consider the period of a simple pendulum in the gravitational
ﬁeld of the spherical Earth. Eﬀectively, gravity is enhanced compared
with the often used ﬂat Earth approximation, such that the period of
the pendulum is shortened. We discuss the ﬂat Earth approximation,
and show when the corrections due to the spherical Earth may be of
interest.

1 Introduction

The experimental fact that all objects fall with the same acceleration is known
as the Weak Equivalence Principle [1]. The ﬁrst systematic tests of the uni-
versality of free fall were done by Galileo [2], who measured the acceleration
of freely falling objects, or of objects rolling down an inclined plane. Such
an approach suﬀers from great inaccuracies, which are related to the short
time scales involved. Indeed, Galileo was unable to accurately determine g,
the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth, due to the lack
of an accurate clock. Galileo concluded that a much better way to check
the universality of free fall was to use a pendulum. Newton, and following
him others, improved on Galileo’s experiments, and were able to determine

g quite accurately. (Notice that it is much harder to measure g than it is to
test the Weak Equivalence Principle.) Because the period is cumulative, by
measuring the time over many cycles of the pendulum one can increase the ac-
curacy in the measurement of g signiﬁcantly. Is the value of the gravitational
acceleration as determined by free-fall experiments identical to the value of
the gravitational acceleration as determined by the period of a pendulum?
In this paper we shall study this question, and show that the spherical ge-
ometry of the Earth aﬀects the eﬀective gravitational acceleration diﬀerently
in the two types of experiments: the eﬀective gravitational acceleration is
greater than g for pendulum experiments, and smaller than g for free-fall
experiments.

The approximation that both Galileo and Newton used (and which is also
used in virtually all physics textbooks from the high school level to the ad-
vanced undergraduate level [3, 4]), is to make the following two assumptions
on the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. First, one assumes that the gravitational
acceleration is independent of the altitude above the surface of the Earth.
That is, one assumes that during its motion, a freely falling object or the
pendulum’s bob experiences a constant acceleration due to gravity, such that
the variation of the gravitational acceleration with altitude (“vertical inho-
mogeneities” of the gravitational ﬁeld) is neglected. Second, for the case of a
pendulum, one assumes that the gravitational ﬁeld lines are parallel. That is,
one neglects the variations in the direction of the gravitational ﬁeld (“lateral
inhomogeneities” of the gravitational ﬁeld) which come about because the
gravitational ﬁeld lines direct towards the center of the Earth. Eﬀectively,
this latter approximation amount to adopting a model for the Earth wherein
the Earth is ﬂat. We shall dubb this latter approximation henceforth as the
“ﬂat Earth” (FE) approximation. The former approximation, when taken
in tandem with the FE approximation, is equivalent to assuming that the
ﬂat Earth extends indeﬁnitely is all directions. As in usual pendulum ex-
periments both assumptions are regularly made, we shall refer by the FE
approximation to both assumptions taken together.

It turns out that the values of the gravitational acceleration as deter-
mined by free fall or by using a pendulum are not identical if one uses the ﬂat
Earth approximation (even without neglecting the vertical inhomogeneities).
Speciﬁcally, the ﬁnite size of the spherical Earth acts in opposite ways: it ef-
fectively decreases the gravitational acceleration in free fall experiments, and
eﬀectively increases the gravitational acceleration in pendulum experiments.
Under most circumstances, the deviations of the eﬀective gravitational accel-

2

eration from g due to the spherical Earth are tiny: the relative change in g is
of order of the ratio of the length of the arm of the pendulum to the radius of
the Earth. For short pendula, the systematic error involved in neglecting this
eﬀect is smaller than the systematic errors in the neglections of other eﬀects,
notably the ﬁnite amplitude eﬀect, the mass of the wire which suspends the
bob, the ﬁnite size of the bob, decay of ﬁnite amplitudes, or the buoyancy
eﬀect [5]. Nelson and Olsson [5] listed many systematics, and included many
sources for error which aﬀect the measurement of g with a pendulum only
minutely. Even with a wire of moderate length (Nelson and Olsson used
a wire whose length was 3m), the FE approximation is responsible for a
systematic error which is considerably larger than some of the systematics
which Nelson and Olsson did discuss. With longer arm, the spherical Earth
eﬀect becomes even more important. As we shall see, for pendula of lengths
comparable with the usual length of the Foucault pendulum, the spherical
Earth eﬀect is comparable to the ﬁnite amplitude eﬀect. And yet, the eﬀect
of the spherical Earth is usually neglected in most treatments.

The spherical Earth eﬀect was treated brieﬂy by Gough [6], who assumed
an inﬁnitely small amplitude. It turns out, however, that the spherical Earth
eﬀect couples with ﬁnite amplitudes in a rather complicated manner.

In this paper we shall consider the eﬀect of a spherical Earth on the period
of a simple pendulum, and show that this eﬀect acts to shorten the period.
That is, when one uses the FE model and ﬁts experimental data to the
parameters of that model, one gets a value for the gravitational acceleration
which is slightly higher than the actual one. As the FE approximation is
used so frequently at all level of instruction (from the high school level to the
advanced undergraduate level), it is instructive to understand the nature of
the FE approximation. In addition, the analysis in the paper is appropriate
for classroom instruction or as a homework assignment at the intermediate
or advanced undergraduate levels.

2 Model

Consider a simple pendulum of arm length l, which moves under the Earth’s
gravity, in the absence of any non-gravitational forces (such as friction). We
assume that the pendulum moves in a perfect vacuum, is suspended from a
perfectly rigid support by an inextensible massless string, and that the bob is
a point. We further assume that the Earth is perfectly spherical. The radius

3

of the Earth is R, and its mass is M. At the surface of the Earth the gravita-
tional acceleration then is g = GM/R2, where G is Newton’s constant. The
opening angle of the pendulum is φ. (See Figure 1.) We assume that the arm
of the pendulum is extensionless and weightless, such that the entire mass of
the pendulum m is in the bob. Denoting by x the distance of the bob from
the center of the Earth, we ﬁnd that x =
2l(R + l) cos φ.

Recall that this result is accurate only to O(κ sin2 ψ0). We write in Eq. (8) the
result in terms of the Elliptic integral just for easy notation and comparison
with the usual result of the FE model. In the limit of β
0 (radius of the
Earth goes to inﬁnity, “ﬂat Earth model”), we recover the regular result for
l/gK(sin2 ψ0). For ﬁnite
the period of a simple pendulum, i.e., TFE = 4
values of β, however, we ﬁnd that the result can be expressed through an
eﬀective gravitational acceleration g∗ = g(1+β), which means that eﬀectively
gravity for a pendulum is enhanced in the spherical Earth compared with the
ﬂat Earth model. Consequently, we ﬁnd that the period of a pendulum when
the spherical Earth is taken into consideration is shorter than in the ﬂat
Earth model. Speciﬁcally

We can also write the solution including higher-order corrections in β. In
this case one can no longer write the solution easily in closed form. Instead,
one can write it as a series expansion as

Notice that the period in Eq. (8) separated into a product of a function of
β and a function of ψ0. This happened just because of the small κ sin2 ψ0
approximation we made. In general, the period is not separable, as is clear
from Eq. (10). As the Elliptic function K(sin2 ψ0) = π/2 + (π/8)ψ2
0),
in the limit of β

0 Eq. (10) indeed agrees with Eq. (8).
Notice that the usual eﬀect of ﬁnite amplitude is to lengthen the period of
the pendulum. The eﬀect of the spherical Earth is in the opposite direction:
it shortens the period. This shortening of the period comes about because
eﬀectively the gravitational acceleration is enhanced compared with its value
at the surface of the Earth. To understand this heuristically, consider the
forces which act on the bob. Because the bob is at height h above the
surface of the Earth, the gravitational acceleration there is given by gh =
g(1 + h/R)−2. Because the weight of the bob directs towards the center of
the Earth, its angle with the string of the pendulum is not φ, but rather φ+α
(see Fig. 1 for the deﬁnitions of the geometrical quantities.) Consequently,
the projection of the bob’s weight perpendicularly to the pendulum’s arm,
which is the force f which determines the torque which drives the oscillations,
is given by

f = mg

Simple geometrical considerations show that sin α = (l/x) sin φ, and h =

terms in sin ψ and l/R, we ﬁnd that

This has the same form as the force which acts on the bob in the ﬂat Earth
model, but with a slightly enhanced gravitational acceleration. Gravity being
eﬀectively stronger, it is clear why the period of the pendulum’s oscillations
shortens. As the period of the pendulum is inversely proportional to the
square root of the gravitational acceleration, we immediately recover Eq. (9).
0. This
implies that when we compute the gravitational acceleration using a pendu-
, not g, that is, we measure a slightly larger
lum, we in fact measure g
acceleration. Of course, with reasonable length for the pendulum, this eﬀect
(cid:17)
is smaller than typical experimental errors. Compare this with the gravi-
tational acceleration which we measure using a free-fall experiment (or an

inclined surface). The gravitational acceleration decreases with height, such
that at all times it is slightly smaller than g at the Earth’s surface. Specif-
ically, the gravitational acceleration is given by gh. When we use the ﬂat
Earth (with inﬁnite extension) model, we in fact neglect this small variation
in the gravitational acceleration. That is, when measuring the gravitational
acceleration using a free fall experiment, we are in eﬀect measuring gh, not
g. Notice that gh < g, whereas g∗ > g. That is, when we use the ﬂat Earth
model we measure diﬀerent quantities for the gravitational acceleration when
we do a pendulum experiment or a free fall experiment.

4 Is the change of the pendulum’s period any-

thing but negligible?

≈

The fractional change in the pendulum’s period being at order l/R implies
106m,
that this eﬀect is very small under most circumstances. As R
even if we take a long pendulum, of length 60m, the change in the period
would be just one part in 105. This eﬀect, which is typically ignored in
textbooks, however, can be at the same order of magnitude as other eﬀects,
which many standard textbooks do discuss [3, 4]. Speciﬁcally, one can choose
reasonable parameters for which this eﬀect is at the same order as the usual
lengthening of the period due to ﬁnite amplitude eﬀects.
In fact, because
these two eﬀects are competing, one can easily choose parameters for which
the spherical Earth eﬀect compensates for the ﬁnite amplitude eﬀect at lead-
ing order, such that dependence on amplitude would be at order φ4

about 0.364m, which is large enough to be set conveniently.

A Evaluation of the integral in Eq. (7)

In this appendix we show how to bring the integral in Eq. (7) to the familiar
form of the complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind. The strategy is to
change the variables such that the interval of integration would be from 0 to
π/2. We choose then a new variable ϕ, deﬁned by sin ψ = sin ψ0 sin ϕ. The
measure of the integral is

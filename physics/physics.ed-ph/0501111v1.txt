Abstract

A simple position probability density formulation is presented for the motion of a particle in a

spherically symmetric potential. The approach provides an alternative to Newtonian methods for

presentation in an elementary course, and requires only elementary algebra and one tabulated in-

tegral. The method is applied to compute the distributions for the Kepler-Coulomb and isotropic

harmonic oscillator potentials. Formulas are also deduced for the average values for powers of

the radial coordinate, and applied to describe perturbations to these systems. The classical re-

sults are also compared with quantum mechanical calculations using the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller

semiclassical quantization.

INTRODUCTION

A signiﬁcant distinction exists between the conceptual framework presented in traditional

introductory physics courses and that used in the advanced physics courses that follow
them1. Introductory physics courses utilize historical Newtonian concepts involving forces

and accelerations, but these concepts never enter in more advanced formulations. The

introductory approach is often characterized as “classical” whereas that of the more advanced

is described as “quantum mechanical.” However, the primary diﬀerence between the two

approaches arises not because of quantization, but instead from a nonessential heuristic

tendency to describe macroscopic systems by instantaneous values for position, speed, and

acceleration, and microscopic systems by time-averaged position probability densities.

The reasons for this are clear, since a macroscopic trajectory is disturbed only slightly

when successively interrogated with visible light, whereas a microscopic system may be

destroyed by interrogation with a single short-wavelength photon. Thus the description of

the microscopic system requires the superposition of many similarly interrogated systems.

Unfortunately, this dichotomy produces a serious disconnect between physics as it is taught

to non-major students in service courses and physics as it is practiced. Despite eﬀorts to

inject modern topics into a Newtonian presentation, this discontinuity further widens the

gap between physics and society.

In a recent essay, Wilczek2 has described the force concept as an insubstantial “culture”

that provides a common language, but not an algorithm for constructing the mechanics
of the world. Similarly, Taylor3 has suggested an alternative approach that uses the least

action principle in place of Newtonian forces. Both essays provide persuasive historical

quotes from respected authorities who have urged that the force approach to the teaching

of elementary physics be replaced. Unfortunately, the Newtonian model oﬀers practical

advantages, particularly in the testing and evaluation of student performance, and is thus

very ﬁrmly entrenched.

It is sometimes argued that initial use of the Newtonian approach is necessary, because

a quantum mechanical formulation would be too demanding mathematically. However, the

problems attacked in elementary textbooks tend to be simpler than those treated in quan-

tum mechanical textbooks. If one examines problems of similar complexity, a Newtonian

formulation is often much more complex mathematically than the corresponding quantum

2

mechanical solution. For example, elementary textbooks describe the two-dimensional Ke-

pler orbit problem, but it is invariably restricted to the special case of a circular orbit (or,

in the ﬂat earth approximation, to a parabolic trajectory). When the classical problem

is formulated in terms of position probability densities, three-dimensional elliptic orbits are

automatically included. Moreover, deviations from a pure inverse square law can be included
as perturbations4, all in a purely classical framework. It is also possible to add semiclassical

quantization directly to the classical solution when desired.

A formulation is presented here in which the periodic three-dimensional motion of a par-

ticle in a central potential is treated in terms of classical position probability densities. The

method is applied to the problems most frequently encountered in an introductory quantum

mechanics course, namely the Kepler-Coulomb and isotropic harmonic oscillator potentials.

While these two potentials lead to solutions that possess certain symmetries, they also have

interesting diﬀerences. For example, the Kepler-Coulomb exempliﬁes an interaction that

decreases with increasing separation, whereas the isotropic harmonic oscillator exempliﬁes

an interaction that increases with increasing separation.

In this presentation the position probability densities are evaluated, closed form expres-

sions for the average values for powers of the radial coordinate are obtained, calculations are

made for sample perturbations of the systems, and the connection to the EBK semiclassical

quantization is prescribed.

II. POSITION PROBABILITY DENSITIES FOR CENTRAL POTENTIALS

Consider a particle of mass m moving in a central potential V (r) described by the standard

spherical polar coordinates r, ϑ, ϕ. For periodic motion with period T , the dwell time, or

position probability density, is given by

where pr is the radial component of the momentum of the particle, which can be described

using conservation of energy as

P (r)dr =

obtained as

With periodic orbital motion, the radial coordinate will undergo librations between turning

points that are speciﬁed by the roots of the equation

Er2

V (r)r2

L2/2m = 0 .

−

For the potentials considered here there will be two roots to the equation, denoted as A±.

Since the potential involves only r, the angular momentum will be constant over the orbit.

In the case of the Kepler-Coulomb and isotropic harmonic oscillator potentials, the orbits

are both ellipses, so Kepler’s second law of equal areas swept out in equal times is valid for

both. Thus

where a and b are the semimajor and semiminor axes of the ellipse, and πab is its cross

normalization of the distribution. If N denotes the number of librations in a period (N=2

for the Kepler-Coulomb, N=4 for the harmonic oscillator), then the average values of powers

of r are given by

IV. PERTURBATION CALCULATIONS

One of the strengths of this method is the ease with which perturbations to the energy

of the system can be computed. The total energy can be deduced from the potential using

V. THE SEMICLASSICAL EBK QUANTIZATION

The semiclassical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization is given by

where µ the Maslov index, which is the number of turning points. This formalism was
applied for spherical symmetric potentials in an earlier paper8. The angular phase integrals

yield a value for the angular momentum

The square of this result

L2 = [ℓ(ℓ + 1) + 1/4] ¯h2

(46)

agrees with the quantum mechanical result in the correspondence limit.

Our earlier calculations8 for the radial phase integral permit the speciﬁcation of the

semimajor and semiminor axes of the ellipses.

(47)

The radial quantum number nr is displayed here so that the two potentials can be com-

pared under conditions whereby nr and ℓ have the same range of values 0, 1, 2, . . . The

expression is usually written in terms of the principal quantum number n

nr + ℓ + 1.

VI. CONCLUSION

This formulation in terms of the classical position probability density provides a mathe-

matically simple exposition of the diﬀerence in frameworks between classical and quantum

mechanical physics. Although this one exercise does not provide a comprehensive alternative

to the standard presentation, it can clearly illustrate at the introductory level the limitations

of the Newtonian approach.

A HUNDRED YEARS OF LARMOR FORMULA

ABSTRACT

Sir Joseph LARMOR showed in 1897 that an oscillating electric charge

emits radiation energy proportional to (acceleration)2. At ﬁrst sight,the re-

sult appears to be valid for arbitrary accelerations. But, perpetual uniform

acceleration has been a case of nagging doubts, as radiation reaction vanishes

and the equivalence principle, as also conformal symmetry of Maxwell equa-

tions each require nil energy loss. Special hypotheses are devised by some to

justify the assumption of radiation loss for both perpetual and non-perpetual

(uniform) accelerations which, as in the case of (uniform) velocities, are really

diﬀerent. The problem is here simply resolved by an explicit computation

to show absence of radiation for the perpetual case and by illustrating that

Larmor formula makes sense only if there is change in acceleration, just as

kinetic energy has nontrivial quantitative sense, only when there is change

in velocity.

Many a breakthrough came to be announced in 1897. Besides J.J.Thompson’s

initial discovery of the electron and Planck’s reluctant recognition of an es-

sential role of Boltzman’s viewpoint leading him in 1899 to his radiation law,

Sir Joseph Larmor had two papers of particular historical note. One1, third in

the series ‘On Dynamical Theory of the Electric and Luminiferous Medium’,

introduced the notions of time-dilation and length contraction with complete

transformations of space-time (now known after Lorentz) and of electromag-

netic ﬁelds to appear in his Adams Prize Essay2. The other3 proposed an

explanation of Zeeman eﬀect (discovered in 1896) diﬀerent from Lorentz, giv-

ing his famous precision eﬀect on a rotating charge in a magnetic ﬁeld. The

same paper also gives the celebrated Larmor formula for the rate at which

an oscillator of charge e emits radiation energy, viz.

g = ˙v is the acceleration and c the velocity of light, which at times, apparent

from the context, will be taken as 1. Whereas the subject of the ﬁrst paper

above was completely clariﬁed in Einstein’s Special Relativity (SR), and the

Larmor precision eﬀect subsumed in quantum theory, the signiﬁcance of Lar-

mor formula (1) continues to be a subject of debate. For instance, retarded

ﬁeld4,5 of a charge, in arbitrary acceleration, gives the above radiation rate

for both relativistic and non-relativistic cases. Lorentz showed that energy

loss in non-relativistic case is equivalent to a force of ‘damping’ or ‘radiation

¨v ;

(2)

As ¨v = 0 for perpetual uniform acceleration (PUA), one would conclude that

there is no radiation in this case. However radiation should occur if uniform

acceleration is for a ﬁnite period T, as ¨v

= 0 at the end points. Two other

arguments for absence of radiation for PUA are suggested by the equivalance

principle (EP) and conformal symmetry of the motion.

(A) Weak and Strong versions of Equivalence Principle6,7,8,9 are: (WEP)

Path of a structureless test body is a geodesic ; (SEP) local space-time ge-

ometry is of Special Relativity (SR). These hold in the large for uniform (=

static, homogeneous) gravitational ﬁeld (UGF) over extended regions, for

the following idealised situations. WEP-A uniformly accelerated frame of

acceleration -g is equivalent to one supported in an UGF of ﬁeld intensity g

; SEP - A freely falling frame in an UGF is equivalent to an inertial frame in

SR. In particular, electric charges placed in the above accelerated or freely

falling frames would not be seen to radiate, as ones supported in static gravi-

tational ﬁelds or inertial frames are understood not to radiate. In the above,

equivalent means indistinguishable only as a regards experiments within the

speciﬁed frames. To verify the conclusion in other frames one must admit as

basic the reality of radiation and its dual role as the fundamental means of

communication with particulate structure in accord with SR and quantum

theory. e.g. 1) far-ﬁeld of a charge once disengaged , exists as a free-ﬁeld or

3

6
photons independent of the source,and capable of ’darkening a photo-plate’

irreversibly ; trapped between two reﬂecting, parallel ﬁlters A,B it constitutes

a macroscopic clock in constant relation with a clock,say, at A. 2) State of

motion of an observer cannot trigger or suppress emission of radiation by

a distant source.3) Radiation may not leave a source without leaving foot-

prints, as it carries away both linear and angular momenta. 4) Fields can

not transmit through space-time if the only ﬁelds present are static. Then,

according to EP a charge in PUA does not radiate in all generality.

(B) Relativistic generalization of (2) was given by Abraham as a 4-vector

orthogonal to 4-velocity vν and 4-acceleration aµ:

Γu =

2
3

e2
c3 Gµ , Gµ =

daµ
dτ −

a2vµ

(3)

where a2 = aµaµ = g2 > 0 and τ is proper time. This expression is also

standard in the works of P.A.M. Dirac and of C.J.Eliezer. As Gµ = 0 is

the condition for uniform acceleration, there is no radiation reaction or ra-

diation loss. Now, both Gµ = 0 and Maxwell free ﬁeld equations have for

their invariance group the 15 parameter conformal group10,11,12. Of the four

special conformal transformations, three with space-like parameters hike ac-

celerations just as three pure Lorentz transformations boost velocities, while

the fourth , with time-like parameter, like space-time dilations, induces elec-

tromagnetic gauge transformations. Thus the wavezone or radiation ﬁeld is

unaﬀected by acceleration hikes, so a charge in uniform acceleration can not

4

radiate as one at rest does not.

It is amusing that if one replaces, in the

Poincare group, Lorentz boosts and time translations by acceleration hikes

and space-time dilations, one obtains12 the ten parameter (de Sitter) group

transitive on the complete connected homogeneous space-time with the met-

ric (c2dt2

dx2)t−2, instead of c2dt2

dx2 for the Poincare group. This

−

−

space-time is thus a model of an UGF, unique upto isomorphism. In partic-

ular one can analyse observer paths along, and on neighbouring geodesics to

study applications to EP. But this is well outside the scope of this work.

An overwhelming majority of scientists, led by G.A.Schott13, Fritz Rohrlich14,15,

Sydney Coleman (Classical Electron Theory From a Modern Standpoint,

Rand. Corp. preprint RM-2820-PR Sept. 1961) and Rudolf Peierls16 have ar-

gued that since g

= 0 in the Larmor formula, there is radiation and therefore

a paradox to be resolved. For this, varied new hypotheses are introduced

in the nature of ignotum per ignotus : 1) Whether acceleration is perpet-

ual or for a short period is irrelevant14,15, as the ﬁrst is only asymptotic.

Such an argument for velocities also results in a paradox : the clock para-

dox of SR. 2) Energy assumed lost comes from the time-rate of change of a

specially postulated ”Acceleration13 or Schott14 energy”, 2

vµ. 3) The

R

relevance of the equivalence principle to this issue is controversial15 ; ‘the

question whether a charge really radiates is meaningless’15, and depends on

observer acceleration, vanishing in co-accelerating frames15. Such an extreme

5

standpoint is not even in accord with classical and quantum measurement

concepts. 4) Conformal acceleration hikes are ill-suited and replaced15 by co-

Standpoint of the present work, in accord with Milner23, Pauli17, von

Laue24, Bondi25,26, Schwinger (Lecture 6, Sec.34 in the manuscript Classical

Electrodynamics by J.Schwinger, L.L.De Raad Jr., K.A.Milton, W.Y.Tsai -

1979), and others8,9,11,12,18, is that the matter is not at all recondite : the

proponents of radiation hypothesis are making an unobtrusive assumption

that Larmor formula is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for radiation,

which it is not.

In fact, as shown here, radiation occurs only if there is

change in acceleration, so much so that if uniform acceleration is for a period

T only, the frequency spectrum of radiation is centred at frequency ω =

2π/T . Hence, for perpetual uniform acceleration there is no radiation loss

at all. Quite independent of such arguments, an exact calculation using

the complete (Bondi-Gold)26,27 ﬁelds of a charge in PUA give zero radiation

6

rate8,9,25. The viewpoint given here was ﬁrst exposited8,27 at a meeting of

the American Physical Society in March 1965 with considerable detail in

Classical Radiation From A Uniformly Accelerated Charge, preprints (with

JJ Walker-referred to as MW) University of Wisconsin (Madison, 1965), and

Indian Institute of Technology (Bombay, 1966) ; reference (9) gives a short

exposition. Coleman’s work, agreeing essentially with Rohrlich’s, came to

attention only recently. The powerful use, here, of the technique of ‘Spectral

resolution’ is inspired by Schwinger, who uses it with eﬀect for the non-

relativistic case.

which plays a crucial role in the considerations below. These additional ﬁeld

terms with δ-function were ﬁrst obtained by Bondi and Gold26 by invoking an

intricate ‘classical pair creation’ mechanism. Already Milner23 in a graphical

analysis of Schott ﬁelds showed that ‘radiation which the solution gives is ...

not from the electron..., but is to be attributed ... to the moving boundary’.

Thus computation of ∂U Θ/∂t+

SΘ for the ﬁelds (12),(13) exhibits a charge

▽·

density on the surface z + t = 0 corresponding to the derivative δ(z + t) of

Θ(z + t) in

.EΘ of (12), showing that there are two charges : the original

▽

charge at ρ = 0, z = zQ, and one at the boundary z + ct = 0 ; it is this latter

charge which gives the outﬂowing radiation. The addition of Bondi-Gold

terms have the eﬀect of cancelling this charge at the boundary and there is

no outﬂowing radiation. The complete (Bondi-Gold) ﬁelds then refer8,9,26,27

to a single charge in (perpetual) hyperbolic motion which does not radiate8,9.

In the following absence of radiation in PUA is demonstrated explicitly in

three diﬀerent ways.

(1) The Poynting vector represents instantaneous energy ﬂux or power ra-

diated. Since the z + ct = 0 condition is relevant only at t

, both H Θ
ϕ

→ −∞

10

and H δ

ϕ vanish at t = 0. As H and S are vectors and vanish at t = 0, they

imply, by linearity, vanishing radiation ﬂux. This is a covariance statement,

much like the eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld of a charge in uniform velocity as

in Trouton-Noble experiment. We conclude with Pauli17 ‘Hyperbolic motion

thus constitutes a special case for which there is no formation of the wave

zone, nor corresponding radiation. (Radiation on the other hand does occur

when two uniform rectilinear motions are connected by a “portion” of hy-

perbolic motion)’. Strangely, however, this argument of Pauli has not found

much favour with proponents of radiation hypothesis. In the following, this

statement is explicitly veriﬁed in toto.

tomatic of non-relativistic results (9) and (25). The relativistic treatment

above, eqn.(26,27), already shows the eﬀects of relativistic attenuation and

inﬁnitely long time interval for acceleration. Indeed, a more exact treatment,

including the near ﬁeld eﬀects, using Plancheral theorem, for the complete

ﬁelds should bring out the broad features encountered above : viz. Larmor

formula represents radiation loss only if there is change in acceleration, shown

14

by a characteristic peak in the Spectral resolution ; For the complete ﬁelds

representing Hyperbolic motion there is no energy loss whatsoever.

It is of interest to compare the case of uniform velocity. Here, there

is the notion of kinetic energy, which, however, quantitatively depends on

the inertial frame chosen unless there is change in velocity. With change in

velocity kinetic energy has a nontrivial quantitative and dynamical mean-

ing. Same is the situation for the Larmor formula which has a quantitative

meaning only when there is change in acceleration. The analogy goes deeper

: Lorentz velocity boosts together with spatial euclidean motions and time

translations are transitive on homogenous space-time metric c2dt2

dx2 of

−

SR, just as acceleration hikes together with spatial euclidean motions and

space-time dilations leave unchanged12 the homogeneous space-time metric

(c2dt2

dx2)/t2. Thus we see that uniform acceleration and equivalence

−

principle take us right into the heart of general relativity giving the metric

of space-time basic to the notion of a cosmological constant.

To summarise (1) The paradox arises only if one fails to distinguish be-

tween the case of uniform acceleration for a ﬁnite period from perpetual

uniform acceleration. Radiation does occur in the ﬁrst case, but not in the

second case. This is like the clock paradox which arises if one does not distin-

guish between perpetual and non-perpetual inertial frames. (2) There is no

need to postulate Acceleration13 or Schott14 energy or question15 the validity

15

of Equivalence princple or of Conformal symmetry argument and attempt

to14,15,17 replace these by certian ﬂat space transformations with associated

hypothesis of event horizons to render radiation unobserable16.

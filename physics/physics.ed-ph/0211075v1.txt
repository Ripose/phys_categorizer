Variable mass systems: A mass redistribution problem

C´elia A. de Sousa and Vitor H. Rodrigues
Departamento de F´ısica da Universidade de Coimbra,
P-3004-516 Coimbra, Portugal∗

The present work is an attempt to emphasize that F = dP/dt does not have the generality
implied by several physics texts of mechanics in the context of variable mass systems. Classical
problems of systems with variable mass can, in general, be solved by applying one or the other of
the following statements: the theorem of linear momentum F = dP/dt or F = M a particle by
particle in the total (constant mass) system. While the treatment of this topic is usually conﬁned to
applications of the ﬁrst statement, the present discussion is mainly concerned with the second one.
This strategy has the advantage of attenuating the paradoxal tendency to atributte to F = dP/dt a
more fundamental role than F = M a in the context of classical newtonian mechanics. Illustrative
examples are included.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Articles on teaching of variable mass systems have addressed a number of important issues1,2,3,4,5. In this context,
we point out a paper of Tiersten3 which, through adequate examples, illustrates a sophisticated approach to be
applied to open systems, i.e., systems for which there exists an inﬂux or eﬄux of mass. However, in some cases a
lot of questions still remains not clear, such as the deﬁnition of the system and the clariﬁcation of the terminology
being used. In addition, the tendency to assume that F = d P/dt is, contrarily to F = M a, always applicable to a
variable mass system is well documented and generalized between students. In our opinion these facts are strongly
dependent on the way this subject is taught in the introductory courses.

In this paper we will suggest a diﬀerent approach, where the expression F = M a, to be applied to all particles
comprising the system, plays a vital role. As the whole (closed) system under study is separable in two (variable
mass) systems, we also point out that a general equation of the type F = M a is always the equation of motion of
one of the two parts of the system. However, let us stress that this does not mean that this form of the Newton’
second law is more fundamental than the other in the context of classical mechanics.

It is worth noticing that one may choose the system arbitrarily, including or excluding part of the total number of
particles, but if interactions act from the outside of the system so deﬁned, i.e., between the system and surrounding
systems, this must be taken into account. Understanding such distinctions between diﬀerent choices of system will
play an important role in the subsequent discussion. In addition, if mass is changing to the surroundings this has to
be kept in mind, and care must be taken in writing down the correct equations of motion.

So, we outline an alternative way to study variable mass systems that is more elegant than the elementary traditional
method6,7, and also explore the analogies with other sophisticated approaches1,3. Two sample problems concerning
nonrigid systems are included to enhance the pedagogical value of this paper. In fact, although the general treatment
of nonrigid systems, such as rockets, ropes or chains, is presented in the literature, the pedagogical advantage of many
of its interesting features has not been fully exploited.

For the sake of completeness we include in Sec. II a summary of the methods usually available in the literature to
study variable mass systems, together with the present alternative physical explanation. Two illustrative examples
are studied in Sec. III, and Sec. IV contains the concluding remarks.

II. GENERAL EQUATIONS OF MOTION

A. Standard elementary approach

The traditional method6 of obtaining the equation of motion of variable mass systems involves the application of

the so-called linear momentum theorem

which is a local form of the impulse-linear momentum principle. In the last equation, F is the net external force and
P refers the momentum of the total constant mass system.

F =

dP
d t

,

(1)

Usually, the system consists of a principal part of mass M with velocity v, and a body of mass ∆ M with velocity u
(u > v), which undergo a completely inelastic collision. After the collision the body of mass M + ∆ M is assumed to
move with a (arbitrary) velocity v + ∆ v. So, the increase in linear momentum is (M +∆M ) (v+∆v) − (M v + ∆M u).
Equating the increase in momentum to the impulse of the external force F on the total system, and dividing both

sides of the equation so obtained by ∆t, we attain, in the limit ∆t → 0,

d
d t

(M v) = F + u

d M
d t

,

where dM/dt is the rate at which mass enters the system with velocity u, i.e., instantaneous mass M (principal part),
moving at velocity v, accumulates mass of velocity u at the rate dM/dt.

This is also the method used in standard treatments of the rocket problem6,7.

B. Sophisticated method based on momentum ﬂux concepts

Using the concept of ﬂux, Thorpe1 deduces momentum theorems for a control surface τ (i.e. a hypothetical closed
surface through which ﬂuxes of momentum and energy may be observed), having an arbitrary motion in a continuous
velocity ﬁeld. The resulting equations are valid for variable mass systems.

By allowing the control surface τ to be at rest, Tiersten3 has obtained, as a special case, a general equation of

motion of the form

which has been applied with success to several interesting examples.

In the last equation, Φ is the momentum ﬂux out of the ﬁxed volume τ , F is the net external force acting on
i mi the mass contained in τ

i mi vi, of these particles, and M =

particles in τ at time t, P is the momentum,
at the same time t.

P

C. Proposed approach and its advantages

Independently of the used methods, based on conservation laws or on the theorems of which they are corollaries,

these frameworks refer always to a closed system of particles. In such conditions, the Newton’s second law

dP
dt

= F − Φ,

F = M acm,

could also be used, with M the total mass and acm the acceleration of the center of mass of the system.

So, let us examine the kinematical behaviour of a body (I) of mass m which approaches, with velocity u, another
body (II) of mass M (principal part of the system), moving with velocity v along the same line as shown in Figure
1. We assume u > v and, after the collision, a body with constant total mass m + M is formed.

vcm =

Taking the time derivative of this expression we obtain (m + M =constant, dm/dt = −dM/dt) the acceleration of

the center of mass,

As we want to describe separately the motion of each part (I) and (II) of the system, we write

F = F(I) + F(II) = m

where F(I) and F(II) are the total force acting on m and M , respectively.

A previous familiarity with a wide variety of examples of variable mass systems suggests that one should have the

following intuitive separation

F(I) = m

for the variable mass system (I),

du
dt

,

and

F(II) = M

+ (v − u)

,

for the variable mass system (II) .

d v
d t

d M
d t

In fact, these are the only physically fruitfull combinations that can be done, allowing to several conclusions.

• The general equation F = M a provides the equation of motion of the whole closed system. The total mass of
the system and the acceleration of the center of mass must be involved. The expression (1) could also be used,
with P being the total momentum.

• The kinematical behaviour of one part of the system is also described by an equation of motion of the type
F = M a, but M refers to the mass of that sub-system, having an acceleration a = d u/d t. An equation of the
type (1) should not be used once M is actually varying.

• For the other (variable mass) sub-system an extra correction, relatively to the general form F = M a, is required

(see Eq. (8)).

As the role of the physical systems (I) and (II) can be interchanged, it must be possible to obtain just one general
equation to be valid for one or the other of the two sub-systems. Otherwise, how could one decide a priori which
variable mass part of a concret system has the general form (7) (or (8)) as equation of motion?

To this purpose it is convenient to rewrite Eqs. (7) and (8) in terms of the momentum of each one part of the

system. For the variable mass system (I) we obtain

and, for the variable mass system (II),

F(I) =

(m u) − u

F(II) =

which prove the self-consistency of the treatment.

method of Tiersten3, as is easily shown.

This simple approach is suitable for undergraduate students of physics and is equivalent to the more sophisticated

In fact, the comparison between Eqs. (9) and (3) allows to deﬁne Φ(I) = −u dm/dt. With respect to Eq. (10) one
can also obtain Φ(II) = −u dM /dt, in accordance with the physical meaning of the momentum ﬂux term out of the
system.

(11)

On the other hand, due to the fact that dm/dt = −dM/dt one arrives, as it should be, at the condition Φ(I) = −Φ(II).
This reinforces the validity of the present treatment, showing that it is a good general guide to variable mass systems,
for which the Newtonian equation of motion can then be written as

d P
d t

= F + u

d M
d t

.

It is worth pointing out that: (i) the system has instantaneous mass M , and linear momentum P = M v as students
will have been told, (ii) F is the net external force on the system so deﬁned, and (iii) u d M /dt is the rate at which
momentum is carried away or into the system.

The sign of dM/dt determines whether the last term of Eq. (11) represents an inﬂux or an eﬄux of momentum

throught the boundaries of the system.

In accordance with the present deduction, the deﬁnition of the system is clear, as well as the concept of linear

momentum which coincides with the concept students learn.

So far as the approach included in the beginning of this section is concerned, we notice the inconsistency about the

deﬁnition of F (see Eq. (2)), which refers to the force acting on the whole constant mass system.

III. SAMPLE PROBLEMS

There are many one-dimensional nonrigid systems that can be solved by appropriate applications of the conservation
laws of energy and linear momentum. However, the conservation laws refer always to a deﬁnite number of particles,
although the system under study can be, in general, separable into two sub-systems, usually studied as variable mass
systems. So, during the motion there is an interchanging of the total mass by both systems: the mass of the total
system remains constant while the distribution of mass on the two sub-systems varies as the motion progresses.

In this context, two illustrative examples adapted from8 are chosen, one of which corresponds to a conservative
system. The method is also suitable to analyse processes of energy transfer as will be illustrated in the second example
concerning a non-conservative system.

Example 1. A coil of a uniform rope is placed just above a hole in a platform. One end of the rope falls (without
friction or air resistence) and pulls down the remaining rope in a steady motion (See Fig. 2). The rope has total
length l and mass per unit length λ, and starts from rest at x = 0.

FIG. 2: Conﬁguration of the rope falling oﬀ the platform with x being the length of the rope which is hanging from the hole.

(i) Determine the force N (x) exerted by the platform on the coil in terms of x.

(ii) Check the validity of diﬀerent forms of Newton’s law when variable mass systems are considered separately.

Solution (i): The rope behaves like a ﬂexible and inextensible one-dimensional conservative system.

In these
conditions, when it falls the energy is conserved, there being no dissipative eﬀects. The acceleration of the falling rope
is not known, as well as the force N (x) acting on the rope by the platform. Notice that this force, which appears as
a result of the constraints imposed on the motion of the rope, cannot be speciﬁed a priori.

So, we start calculating the acceleration of the falling rope using the law of conservation of energy. In fact, the
total energy E = K + U , where K is the kinetic energy and U the potential energy, is a constante since the system
is conservative, so ∆E = 0.

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the x axis has its origin on the platform and points downwards. Referring to this ﬁgure, in
which x denotes the displacement of the lower end of the rope from its initial position x = 0, we see that the variation
of the total kinetic energy of the system is

v
x
o

I
 
(

(
where v = dx/dt is the velocity of the moving part of the rope.

The corresponding variation of the potential energy (potential relative to the platform) is

where g represents the acceleration due to gravity.

Conservation of energy, ∆ E = 0, then gives the velocity v in terms of x,

Taking the time derivative of the last equation, and by the chain rule diﬀerentiation, we obtain the acceleration of

the falling rope:

v(x) = (g x)1/2.

.

Now, according with the recommended approach, we apply (4) to the whole system of constant mass λ l, starting

with the calculation of the center of mass acceleration.

The conﬁguration of the system at time t (see Fig. 2) shows that the rope can be separated into two sub-systems:

(I) : the suspended part with length x, mass λ x and velocity v;

(II) : the remainder rope at rest on the platform, with mass λ (l − x).

So, the velocity of the center of mass can be calculated directly allowing for

vcm =

v =

(g x)1/2.

l

l

The time derivative of this equation, together with Eqs. (12) and (13), allows to calculate the acceleration of the

center of mass

Newton’s second law applied to the (closed) system (I)+(II) is given by equation (4). As the net external force

includes the total weight of the rope, λ l g, and the total force by the platform, N (x), we obtain

allowing for the total force by the platform on the rope

which shows that N (x) = 0 when x = 2l/3.

(ii): Other important features on the problem can be discussed if we consider the two sub-systems separately. So,
looking to the problem from the point of view of a variable mass system one has, for the sub-system (I): M = λ x,
P = λ x v, dP/dt = 3/2 λ x g, u = v and Φ = − u dM/dt = − λ x g. Some of these values are quoted, for exposition
convenience, in Table I.

The net external force acting on this system is F = λ x g + T (x), with T (x) being the tension in the rope at the
boundary of the system (I), i.e., the tension in the rope at the distance x from its lower end. This unknown quantity
can then be calculated using Eq. (11), allowing for T (x) = − λ x g/2.

This expression of T (x), and the equations referred above are valid for x ≤ 2 l/3. For values x > 2 l/3, N (x) = 0

and T (x) = 0, which corresponds to the free fall of the rope.

The reader can verify by himself that, as stated previously, a general equation of the type F = M a is valid for

this part of the system (M = λ x; a = dv/dt = g/2).

A similar study on the variable mass sub-system (II) can be done. The relevant physical quantities for this
variable mass system are also summarized in Table I. As T (x) has already been calculated, the expression (16) for
N (x) can be conﬁrmed using again Eq. (11), which corroborates the validity of this equation.

One can also see from Table I that, as it should be, the ﬂux-like term, Φ = −u dM/dt = λ x g, appears with a plus

sign because positive momentum is ﬂowing out of the system (II).

Example 2. The upper end of a uniform open-link chain of length l, and mass per unit length λ, is released
from rest at x = 0. The lower end is ﬁxed to a support at point A as is shown in Fig. 3 (Examination of Classical
Mechanics, Coimbra University, 2001).

(i) Find the tension T (x) in the chain at point A in terms of x.

(ii) Check the validity of diﬀerent forms of Newton’s law when two variable mass systems are considered separately.

(iii) Calculate the variation in the thermal internal energy of the system.

Solution (i): According with the suggested approach, we start with the study of the whole closed system using
Eq. (4). Assuming the free fall of the chain, the acceleration of the center of mass is easily calculated. To this purpose
we consider two sub-systems:

(I) : the free falling part of the chain of mass λ(l − x/2), with the velocity v;

(II) : the remainder chain at rest, with mass λ x/2.

Bearing in mind these values, the center of mass velocity is given by

The acceleration of the center of mass can also be obtained, in terms of v and g:

In fact, the fall takes place with uniform acceleration g and it follows that d2x/dt2 = dv/dt = g. Since dv/dt =
v dv/dx, a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation is obtained, v dv − g dx = 0, which is easily integrated (x0 = v0 = 0) to
give

The center of mass velocity and the acceleration of the chain can then be calculated as functions of x. For the

acceleration (see Eq. (18)), straightforward substitutions and simpliﬁcations yields

Newton’s second law (4), applied to the chain as the (closed) system (I)+(II), allows for

F = λ l g + T (x) = λ l g (1 −

),

where the net external force includes the total weight of the chain, λ l g, and the tension force, T (x), in the chain at

The last equation allows to attain

(ii): To check the validity of Newton’s second law for variable mass system, we deﬁne the relevant quantities which
are shown in Table II. A procedure analogous to that of example 1, shows that the general equation of motion (11)
must be used in order to conﬁrm the results already obtained for T (x). This can be done for sub-systems (I) and (II)
using the values quoted in Table II.

One can also conﬁrm that a general equation of the type F = M a can be used for the sub-system (I).
(iii): The energetic balance can be analysed with the law of conservation of energy if an isolated system is chosen.

If the system is deﬁned by the chain, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics (there is no transfer of heat) reads

W = ∆ Kcm + ∆ Ether,

(22)

where W is the work done by the gravity, Kcm is the center of mass kinetic energy and Ether is the thermal internal
energy.

The force T (x) also acts through the boundary of the system but does not perform real work. However, the
pseudowork9,10,11 of this force, calculated with the displacement of the center of mass, allows to determine the
variation of the macroscopic mechanical energy (Em = Kcm + U ).

In fact, the variation of the center of mass kinetic energy, ∆ Kcm, can be obtained by the so-called pseudowork-
energy equation, which can be deduced by integrating both sides of equation (4) with respect to the position of the
center of mass

F . d xcm =

(λ l g + T (x) ) . d xcm = ∆ Kcm.

(26)

While allowing for dynamical eﬀects, this relation is accurate, in articulation with the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics,
to study energetic processes. The clariﬁcation of this coupled (mechanical and thermodynamic) view has been pointed
out by several authors in the context of friction force problems11,12,13, and other nonrigid systems in general13,14.

The ﬁrst integral of Eq. (23) represents the work done by the gravitational force on the falling chain during the
displacement of the center of mass. So, it can be shifted to the right-hand side of the same equation in the form of
change in potential energy (W = − ∆ U ), showing, in fact, that for the zero-work force T (x)

T (x) . d xcm = ∆ Kcm + ∆ U = ∆ Em.

Z

As equation (22) can also be written in the form

∆ Ether = − ∆ Em,

one can write

∆ Ether = − ∆ Em = −

T (x) . d xcm.

Z

It follows that this equation is easily calculated using Eq. (21) for T (x) and d xcm = (1 − x/(2l) ) d x, which comes

from Eq. (17). So, performing the substitutions we obtain the thermal internal energy change

∆ Ether =

λ x g (1 −

) d x =

λ x2 g (1 −

The increase of the thermal internal energy of the chain is related to an increase in temperature of the chain after

inelastic collisions among the links of the chain.

For the total motion of the chain, one easily obtains (0 ≤ x ≤ 2 l), as expected

In fact, the initial mechanical energy of the chain is converted into thermal internal energy.

∆ Ether = −∆ U = λ l2 g.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The method suggested in this paper is suitable allowing to the discussion of variable mass systems in a straight-
forward way. We have shown that it reveals a simple underlying unity to the systematic deduction of the general
equation, in which the deﬁnition of the system is clear, a point which is not always evident when using other methods.
The essential point is to consider ﬁrst the system as a ﬁxed mass one, to which F = M a (or F = d P/dt) can be
applied. In fact, if the study is elaborated over a ﬁxed number of particles, both forms of Newton’s second law are
totally equivalents.

This important point has to be kept in mind, and teachers can avoid incorrect interpretations by insisting that
Newton’s second law must be applied to closed systems of particles. In general, for open systems both forms of this
law are incorrect and so both must be re-analysed.

Then, going further, a general guide to obtain a phenomenological relation allowing to describe variable mass

systems is set up.

The crucial point of our methodology is also followed when solving sample problems, which are ﬁrst studied as
closed systems with the center of mass playing a special role. The examples used to illustrate these questions are
nonrigid systems with signiﬁcative change of conﬁguration, allowing to explore other important aspects of this kind of
multi-particle systems that are not usually considered. For instance, they show the importance of a precise deﬁnition
of the concept of work when deformations are present, and a clear distinction between work and pseudowork.

As the general equation d P/d t = F + u d M /d t shows, F = d P/d t is a correct equation of motion only in two
special cases: (i) if the increment of mass d M is at rest (u = 0), and (ii) if M = constant, in which case it is totally
equivalent to F = M a. The option in using preferentially this last statement, in the present paper, is to show that
this relation is also powerful when analysing systems with variable mass, and can also be chosen as starting point. Of
course, there may remain good pedagogical reasons to refer F = d P/d t over F = M a bearing in mind subsequent
studies on relativity and quantum mechanics, but this is quite another story.

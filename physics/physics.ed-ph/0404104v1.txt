Abstract. Quantum mechanics courses focus mostly on its computational aspects.
This alone does not provide the same depth of understanding as most physicists
have of classical mechanics. The understanding of classical mechanics is signiﬁcantly
bolstered by the intuitive understanding that one acquires through the playing of
games like baseball at an early age.
It would be good to have similar games for
quantum mechanics. However, real games that involve quantum phenomena directly
are impossible. So, computer simulated games are good alternatives. Here a computer
It is hoped that
game involving three interacting quantum particles is discussed.
such games played at an early age will provide the intuitive background for a better
understanding of quantum mechanics at a later age.

“. . . and then the wavefunction collapses.” What visual images are inspired by such a
statement? We can visualize collapsing bridges, buildings and maybe even a souﬄ´e. But
collapsing wavefunctions are a visual mystery for both novices and experts in quantum
mechanics. A few years of graduate school can teach a physics student the mathematical
methods as well as the experimental tests of quantum mechanics. However, acquiring an
intuitive understanding of the subject is more challenging. Classical mechanics is easier
to understand due to the ready availability of visual images (collapsing bridges, souﬄ´es,
etc.).
It is also signiﬁcant that these images of classical mechanics are observed by
everyone at an early age making them part of our intuition. Similar early introductions
to quantum phenomena would be very useful for the learning experience of children.
They would build a foundation for later, more rigorously mathematical, presentations
of quantum mechnics. However, real visual images for quantum mechanics are diﬃcult
to ﬁnd. So let us look for some computer simulated visual images through a computer
game based on quantum mechanics.

1. Introduction

Using computers for physics education has become quite mainstream through the
last decade[1, 2, 3, 4]. However, using physics based computer games is not that

Figure 1. The game screen at starting time (left) and at a later time (right).

common[5, 6]. Personally, I prefer the game approach for several reasons.
It can
provide an intuitive understanding at a very early age without the need for mathematics.
It is non-threatening and develops physics intuition in a relaxed setting.
It is like
understanding projectile motion while playing baseball.
In particular, for quantum
mechanics, computer games are uniquely useful as real games like baseball shed very
little light on the subject.

In the past, I have developed a game based on the quantum mechanical free particle
(“Quantum Duck Hunt”)[7, 8]. Here, I present a signiﬁcantly more complex system – an
interacting three particle system. The game based on this system is called “Quantum
Focus”[9]. It deals with various subtle aspects of quantum observation and wavefunction
collapse[10].

It
This game is not meant to teach quantum mechanics to college students.
is meant to develop “quantum intuition” at a much earlier age (maybe elementary
school). Children playing this kind of games are expected to develop “gut feelings”
about quantum phenomena just as they usually do for classical phenomena by playing
baseball or soccer. The approach here is not that of standard accepted padagogy.
Something diﬀerent is being tried to see if it works better.
I have tried it on a few
children (my own and their friends!). The results are very encouraging – now they
want to learn quantum mechanics! If we wait until college to develop quantum intuition
in youngsters, we might miss the formative years when most intuition is developed.
However, college students may also beneﬁt from this game by studying the computer
code and trying to come up with their own variations.

2. The game

The game is started by choosing “Start” from the “Action” menu. Three boxes colored
red, green and blue appear on a black background screen. With time, the color of
each box begins to smear into neighboring boxes (see ﬁgure 1). At the same time, the
brightest spot in each color smear moves away from the other two. As the colors spread,

Playing Games with the Quantum Three-Body Problem

3

they produce mixtures of the primary colors in various proportions in diﬀerent boxes
on the screen.

The object of the game is to make each color smear as small as possible and at the
same time bring the three colors as close together as possible. The only tool available
for achieving this is the click of the mouse at strategic points. Clicking the mouse will
retract a color completely into a single box – the one that was clicked. But this retraction
or “collapse” will occur only with a probability proportional to the preexisting intensity
of that color in that box. So, if there is very little red in a certain box, it is unlikely that
red can be collapsed into it by any amount of clicking. This is why, sometimes, a click
of the mouse may produce no eﬀect at all. An interesting sound eﬀect will accompany
the actual collapse of a color.

The quantum mechanically minded readers must already have noted that the three
primary colors represent three particles. The intensity of a primary color is related to
the probability of ﬁnding the corresponding particle at a given place. The mouse clicks
simulate a particle detector’s attempts at detecting a particle. The retraction of a color
into a single box simulates a wavefunction collapse.
In the present model, the three
particles are tied together by attractive forces. So, it is a bit tricky to see why quantum
mechanics makes the three color smears move apart. This eﬀect will be discussed later.
A score is computed in each time step. It depends on how small each color smear
is and how close the three colors are. So, the goal is to produce a single white box and
no other colored boxes. But this state of perfection can be seen to be impossible. The
score displayed (at the top left corner) is the maximum score achieved during the course
of a game.

It should be noted that, while the colors spread, nothing is lost. Colors that spread
oﬀ-screen on one edge reappear on the opposite edge. This eﬀect may be used for game
strategies.

The game can be played at four levels of diﬃculty. The scoring formula respects

the level of diﬃculty. The features of these levels will be discussed later.

3. The quantum three particle problem

This game is based on the quantum dynamics of three interacting distinguishable
particles. Most quantum problems deal with the solution of the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation. But here we are concerned with the wavefunction collapse and
subsequent change in the wavefunction. Hence,
it is necessary to solve the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation[10].

Let the positions of the three particles be qi, and their momenta be pi (i = 1, 2, 3.).
Let the wavefunction of the system be ψ({qi}, t) and its hamiltonian H({qi}, {pi})
where t is time. Then the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation to be solved is[12, 13]

forces (see ﬁgure 2). Also, The springs are assumed to have zero unextended length.

It can be seen that, like most three particle problems, this cannot be separated in
variables. The dependence on qc complicates the hamiltonian signiﬁcantly as it is not
an independent coordinate. qc depends on the particle coordinates due to the following
zero net force condition.

Equation 1 can be solved numerically to obtain the time development of the
wavefunction provided an intial value is speciﬁed. At any point in this time development,
if a particle detector detects the ﬁrst particle in a small region R, it will be with a

If the particle is actually detected, the wavefunction must collapse to

ψc({qi}, t) = A∆R(q1 − q0)ψ({qi}, t),

where ∆R(q1 − q0) is a sharply peaked function that is nonzero only in the region of
detection R centered about the position q0. The detailed form of this function depends
on the detector sensitivity in the region R. In the limit R → 0, it is the Dirac delta
function:

∆R(qk − q0) = δ3(qk − q0).

R→0

The constant A is needed to renormalize ψ after the collapse. The detection of the other
two particles can be described similarly.

After the collapse, ψ is replaced by ψc and the time development continued as given

by equation 1 until the next collapse.

4. The numerical technique

The computer screen being 2-dimensional, the above formulation will be reduced to its
2-dimensional equivalent for the purpose of the game. To use standard ﬁnite diﬀerence
methods, the screen space is divided into a matrix of m columns and n rows to produce
a total of m × n boxes. For the purpose of a game, we may sacriﬁce accuracy for speed
as long as the qualitative aspects of the system are maintained. So, the maximum values
of m and n are chosen to be 12 and 8.

To solve the Schr¨odinger equation, boundary conditions must be speciﬁed. There

are several possible natural choices:

(i) Perfectly reﬂecting boundary conditions.

(ii) Perfectly absorbing boundary conditions.

(iii) Periodic boundary conditions.

The perfectly reﬂecting boundary produces a discontinuity at the boundary that
interferes with visualization. The perfectly absorbing boundary allows particles to go
oﬀ screen, thus making them useless for visualization. The periodic condition seems
to be the best for visualization. It identiﬁes the left edge to the right and the bottom
edge to the top (toroidal topology). Hence, particle current that disappears on one edge
reappears on the opposite edge.

The discrete forms for the x and y components of each coordinate qi may be written

as

qix = aix∆x,

qiy = aiy∆y,

(9)

Playing Games with the Quantum Three-Body Problem

6

where i = 1, 2, 3, aix = 0, 1, 2, . . . , m − 1, and aiy = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. ∆x is the mesh
width in the x direction and ∆y is the mesh width in the y direction.
If the mesh
width in time is ∆t, then equation 1 produces the following recursive formula for the
computation of ψ.

ψ({qi}, t) = (1 − iH∆t/¯h)ψ({qi}, t − ∆t).

(10)

In general, the above numerical algorithm for the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
is known to be unstable[11]. However, we can use it in the present case because
wavefunction collapses are expected to preempt any instability. Besides, as noted before
we are not looking for high accuracy.

The wavefunction ψ, at one instant of time, is a function of all coordinates qi. So,
its discretized form must depend on all aix and aiy. Thus, for numerical computation, ψ
is represented by an array of 6 dimensions (one for each aix and aiy). In the notation of
the C language it would be: ψ[a1x][a1y][a2x][a2y][a3x][a3y]. For compactness of notation
I can write this as: ψ[a][b][c][d][e][f ] or ψa,b,c,d,e,f . Then the ﬁnite diﬀerence form of
the operation by the hamiltonian H is found from equation 5 using equation 9 and the
following ﬁnite diﬀerence forms of the p2

i operators.

(11)

Here the most common ﬁnite diﬀerence form for second derivatives is used. Using
equations 5, 9, and 11 in equation 10, the wavefunction for successive time steps can be
computed. The numerical method chosen here does not maintain normalization of ψ.
Hence, after each time step computation, ψ must be normalized[11].

Also after each time step computation, the screen image must be updated to provide
an animated visual eﬀect. The RGB coloring scheme on the computer screen provides
a natural way of representing the three particle probabilities. The red, green and blue
color intensities in a box are made proportional to the probabilities of ﬁnding each
of the three particles in that box. The discretized version of equation 6 provides the
probabilities to be used. They are as follows.

P1 =

P3 =

Xa,b,e,f

Xa,b,c,d

int CQFocusDoc::Red(int a, int b)
{

int c, d, e, f;
float red = 0;

So, the C++ code used to ﬁnd the amount of red color (particle 1) in a box is as follows.

(12)

for(c=0;c<xpts;c++)

for(d=0;d<ypts;d++)

for(e=0;e<xpts;e++)

for(f=0;f<ypts;f++)

red += norm(Psi[a][b][c][d][e][f]);

return(255*sqrt(sqrt(red))); //Square root used to enhance

//color for better visibility.

}

The amounts of the other two colors are computed similarly.

When the mouse button is clicked in a box, one of the three particles is picked
randomly for collapse and then the decision to actually collapse it is made based on
the probability given by equation 12. The following C++ code fragment makes these
probabilistic decisions.

partnum = MyRandom(3); //Generates an integer random number between 0 and 2.
intensity = MyRandom(256);
intensity = (intensity*intensity*intensity)/(256*256);
// The above redifinition improves game by requiring less mouse clicking.

i = point.x/bwidth; // x pixel position divided by box width.
j = point.y/bheight; // y pixel position divided by box height.

switch(partnum)
{
case 0:

break;

case 1:

if(intensity < pDoc->Red(i,j)) // Function Red(i,j) defined above.

{ pDoc->Collapse(partnum, CPoint(i,j)); setcollapse = true;}

if(intensity < pDoc->Green(i,j))

{ pDoc->Collapse(partnum, CPoint(i,j)); setcollapse = true;}

Playing Games with the Quantum Three-Body Problem

8

break;

case 2:

break;

}

if(intensity < pDoc->Blue(i,j))

{ pDoc->Collapse(partnum, CPoint(i,j)); setcollapse = true;}

The wavefunction after the collapse is given by equation 7. The function ∆R(qk − q0)
in its discrete form is chosen as the discrete form of the Dirac delta function:

∆R(qk − q0) =

if akx = a0x and aky = a0y

1,
0, otherwise,

(

(13)

where the integer values akx, a0x, aky and a0y are deﬁned as in equation 9. So, the C++
code for wavefunction collapse is as follows.

void CQFocusDoc::Collapse(int partnum, CPoint point)
{

int a, b, c, d, e, f;
switch(partnum)
{
case 0:

for(a=0;a<xpts; a++)
for(b=0;b<ypts;b++)

for(c=0;c<xpts;c++)

for(d=0;d<ypts;d++)

for(e=0;e<xpts;e++)

for(f=0;f<ypts;f++)
{

if(a!=point.x || b!=point.y)
Psi[a][b][c][d][e][f] = 0;

}

}

break;

case 1:

for(a=0;a<xpts; a++)
for(b=0;b<ypts;b++)

for(c=0;c<xpts;c++)

for(d=0;d<ypts;d++)

for(e=0;e<xpts;e++)

for(f=0;f<ypts;f++)
{

if(c!=point.x || d!=point.y)
Psi[a][b][c][d][e][f] = 0;

break;

case 2:

for(a=0;a<xpts; a++)
for(b=0;b<ypts;b++)

for(c=0;c<xpts;c++)

for(d=0;d<ypts;d++)

for(e=0;e<xpts;e++)

for(f=0;f<ypts;f++)
{

if(e!=point.x || f!=point.y)
Psi[a][b][c][d][e][f] = 0;

}

break;

}
Normalize();

}

Here partnum gives the randomly picked particle number and point identiﬁes the box
clicked.

5. The levels of diﬃculty

The game can be played at four diﬀerent levels of diﬃculty. The diﬃculty level is
increased by increasing the values of the spring constants ki. This increases the rate at
which the positions of maximum probability move apart. The reason will be seen in the
next section.

The diﬃculty level is increased also by reducing the total number of boxes. This
increases the speed of computation and hence increases the rate of spreading of the
wavefunction.

The score allows for higher diﬃculty levels.

6. Some results

The primary purpose of this game is to provide repeated and consistent visual eﬀects
that mimic quantum wavefunction dynamics. As expected, the wavefunction collapse
leaves the undetected particles unaﬀected. Also as expected, the probability proﬁle
of each particle spreads with time. The resulting mix of the primary colors produces
some rather unusual color eﬀects that may interest the artists amongst us. What is
not-so-obvious is as follows. If we start with one particle in a collapsed state (with no
velocity), with time its probability peak moves away from those of the other particles!
As the potential function used here is attractive, this is somewhat surprising. However,
closer scrutiny can explain this phenomenon.

Consider the standard one-particle harmonic oscillator. Higher energy eigenstates
have probability peaks farther away from the origin. This means that particles that

Playing Games with the Quantum Three-Body Problem

10

start oﬀ with higher momenta are likely to have their probability peaks farther away.
For the present case, a particle collapsed to its position eigenstate has high probabilities
for large momenta and hence, large energy. This makes its probability peak move away
from the other particles.

Nonholonomic constraints and Voronec’s equations

Is it allowed, in the context of the Lagrange multiplier formalism, to assume that nonholo-

nomic constraints are already in eﬀect while setting up Lagrange’s function? This procedure

is successfully applied in a recent book [L. N. Hand and J. D. Finch, Analytical Mechanics]

to the problem of the rolling penny, but it does not work in general, as we show by means

of a counterexample. It turns out that in many cases the use of nonholonomic constraints in

the process of construction of the Lagrangian is allowed, but then the correct equations of

motion are the little known Voronec’s equations.

Abstract

1

In the Lagrange multiplier formalism as applied to nonholonomic systems, the Lagrangian is

written as if there were no constraints. The nonholonomic constraints are taken into account in the

formulation of the equations of motion, but not during the construction of the Lagrangian. Setting

up the Lagrangian assuming that the constraints are already in eﬀect is completely equivalent to

substituting the constraint equations into the Lagrangian written as if there were no constraints.

It is tempting to take it for granted that the ensuing reduced Lagrangian together with the relevant

constraint equations always lead to the correct equations of motion for the system. The procedure

just described is successfully used in a recent book [1] to solve the problem of a penny rolling on

an inclined plane. Unfortunately, contrary to what the mentioned book appears to suggest, this

approach is not valid in general, as we proceed to show with the help of a counterexample.

Consider a homogeneous sphere rolling without slipping on a horizontal plane. This problem

is treated by the Lagrange multiplier method in [2]. Let X, Y, Z be cartesian axes ﬁxed in space

with the Z-axis perpendicular to the plane. The principal moments of inertia with respect to the
center of the sphere are all equal to 2mR2/5. With x, y the coordinates of the center of the sphere,

the Lagrangian, being equal to the kinetic energy, is given by

The constraint equations are

L =

ω2 .

˙x = Rωy = R ˙θ sin φ − R ˙ψ sin θ cos φ ,

˙y = −Rωx = −R ˙θ cos φ − R ˙ψ sin θ sin φ .

(2)

In terms of the Euler angles φ, θ, ψ the Lagrangian (1) takes the form

L =

( ˙x2 + ˙y2) +

( ˙φ2 + ˙θ2 + ˙ψ2 + 2 ˙φ ˙ψ cos θ) .

According to the method employed in [1], which takes into account the rolling constraint in

the construction of the Lagrangian, the kinetic energy is written in terms of the rotational degrees

of freedom alone by taking the moments of inertia with respect to the contact point of the sphere

with the plane. The Lagrangian is now

¯L =

This is exactly the Lagrangian that one obtains by inserting the constraint equations (2) into the

Lagrangian (1), which was written as if there were no constraints. In terms of the Euler angles the

¯L =

( ˙θ2 + ˙ψ2 sin2 θ) +

( ˙φ2 + ˙ψ2 cos2 θ + 2 ˙φ ˙ψ cos θ) .

(5)

Since the variables x and y do not appear in ¯L, according to the reasoning in [1] the constraint

equations (2) are no longer relevant to the formulation of the equations of motion. In particular,

the Lagrange equation for θ is

d
dt  

∂ ¯L
∂ ˙θ !

− ∂ ¯L
∂θ

= 0 =⇒ 7¨θ − 5 ˙ψ2 sin θ cos θ + 2 ˙φ ˙ψ sin θ = 0 .

(6)

The treatment of this problem by the Lagrange multiplier method shows that the two Lagrange

multipliers vanish [2]. According to equation (58d) of [2] the correct equation of motion for θ is

¨θ + ˙φ ˙ψ sin θ = 0 ,

(7)

which is completely diﬀerent from equation (6). The diﬀerential equations (6) and (7) generally
yield diﬀerent solutions for θ because φ, θ, ψ, ˙φ, ˙θ, ˙ψ can be arbitrarily chosen at any particular

instant t0. It is clear, therefore, that the approach suggested in [1] lacks generality, since it works

for the rolling penny but fails for the rolling sphere.

In a previous paper [3] we remarked that it is possible to perform a reduction of the Lagrangian

taking into account the constraints, but in this case the correct equations of motion are Voronec’s

equations. Given a dynamical system described by the conﬁguration variables q1, . . . , qn, suppose
the ﬁrst m velocities are independent and the k = n − m remaining velocities can be expressed in

terms of the independent ones by means of the equations

m

˙qm+l −

alj ˙qj = 0 ,

l = 1, . . . , k ,

(8)

Xj=1
where the coeﬃcients alj are functions of the generalized coordinates q1, . . . , qn.

Let L be the Lagrangian written without taking into account the nonholonomic constraint

equations (8). If the last k velocities are eliminated from the Lagrangian by means of equations
(8), a reduced Lagrangian ¯L results:

L(q1, . . . , qn, ˙q1, . . . , ˙qn, t) = ¯L(q1, . . . , qn, ˙q1, . . . , ˙qm, t) .

(9)

Voronec’s equations of motion are [3, 4]

Setting q1 = φ, q2 = θ, q3 = ψ, q4 = x, q5 = y, in the present case m = 3 and k = 2. The

constraint equations (2) can be written in the form (8) with

a11 = 0 , a12 = R sin φ , a13 = −R sin θ cos φ , a21 = 0 , a22 = −R cos φ , a23 = −R sin θ sin φ .

The deﬁnition (11) furnishes immediately the only nonvanishing coeﬃcients bν
ij:

12 = −b1
b1

21 = −R cos φ , b1

13 = −b1

31 = −R sin θ sin φ , b1

23 = −b1

32 = R cos θ cos φ ,

(13)

12 = −b2
b2

21 = −R sin φ , b2

13 = −b2

31 = R sin θ cos φ , b2

23 = −b2

32 = R cos θ sin φ .

(14)

It follows that Voronec’s equation for θ is

7mR2

2mR2

¨θ − mR2 ˙ψ2 sin θ cos θ +

˙φ ˙ψ sin θ = m ˙x(b1

21 ˙φ + b1

23 ˙ψ) + m ˙y(b2

21 ˙φ + b2

23 ˙ψ) .

(15)

The use of the constraint equations (2) and a little algebra reduce the above equation to

¨θ + ˙φ ˙ψ sin θ = 0 ,

(16)

which coincides with the correct equation for θ furnished by the Lagrange multiplier method. It is

equally straightforward to check that the remaining Voronec equations for φ and ψ coincide with

those obtained by the Lagrange multiplier method.

In short, the method employed in [1] is not valid in general and should not be taught to students.

The correct result obtained for the rolling penny is the product of a mere accident.

As a general rule, the use of nonholonomic constraints while setting up the Lagrangian is

allowed, but the correct equations of motion are Voronec’s equations, and not the ones given by

the Lagrange multiplier method.

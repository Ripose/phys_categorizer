Abstract

This is the ﬁrst graduate course on elementary quantum mechanics in Inter-
net written for the beneﬁt of undergraduate and graduate students. It is a
translation (with corrections) of the Romanian version of the course, which
I did at the suggestion of several students from diﬀerent countries. The top-
ics included refer to the postulates of quantum mechanics, one-dimensional
barriers and wells, angular momentum and spin, WKB method, harmonic
oscillator, hydrogen atom, quantum scattering, and partial waves.

The energy quanta occured in 1900 in the work of Max Planck (Nobel prize,
1918) on the black body electromagnetic radiation. Planck’s “quanta of
light” have been used by Einstein (Nobel prize, 1921) to explain the pho-
toelectric eﬀect, but the ﬁrst “quantization” of a quantity having units of
action (the angular momentum) belongs to Niels Bohr (Nobel Prize, 1922).
This opened the road to the universalization of quanta, since the action is
the basic functional to describe any type of motion. However, only in the
1920’s the formalism of quantum mechanics has been developed in a system-
atic manner. The remarkable works of that decade contributed in a decisive
way to the rising of quantum mechanics at the level of fundamental theory
of the universe, with successful technological applications. Moreover, it is
quite probable that many of the cosmological misteries may be disentan-
gled by means of various quantization procedures of the gravitational ﬁeld,
advancing our understanding of the origins of the universe. On the other
hand, in recent years, there is a strong surge of activity in the information
aspect of quantum mechanics. This aspect, which was generally ignored in
the past, aims at a very attractive “quantum computer” technology.

At the philosophical level, the famous paradoxes of quantum mechanics,
which are perfect examples of the diﬃculties of ‘quantum’ thinking, are
actively pursued ever since they have been ﬁrst posed. Perhaps the most
famous of them is the EPR paradox (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, 1935) on the
existence of elements of physical reality, or in EPR words: “If, without in any
way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability
equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element
of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.” Another famous
paradox is that of Schr¨odinger’s cat which is related to the fundamental
quantum property of entanglement and the way we understand and detect
it. What one should emphasize is that all these delicate points are the
sourse of many interesting and innovative experiments (such as the so-called
“teleportation” of quantum states) pushing up the technology.

Here, I present eight elementary topics in nonrelativistic quantum me-
chanics from a course in Spanish (“castellano”) on quantum mechanics that
I taught in the Instituto de F´ısica, Universidad de Guanajuato (IFUG),
Le´on, Mexico, during the semesters of 1998.

1. THE QUANTUM POSTULATES

The following six postulates can be considered as the basis for theory and
experiment in quantum mechanics in its most used form, which is known as
the Copenhagen interpretation.

P1.- To any physical quantity L, which is well deﬁned at the classical level,

one can associate a hermitic operator ˆL.

found one can associate a (normalized) wavefunction. ψ (k ψ k2

P2.- To any stationary physical state in which a quantum system can be
L2= 1).
P3.- In (appropriate) experiments, the physical quantity L can take only the
eigenvalues of ˆL. Therefore the eigenvalues should be real, a condition
which is fulﬁlled only by hermitic operators.

P4.- What one measures is always the mean value L of the physical quantity
(i.e., operator) ˆL in a state ψn, which, theoretically speaking, is the
corresponding diagonal matrix element
hψn | ˆL | ψni = L.
coordinate and momentum, bxi andcpk, when calculated with the wave-

functions f and g satisfy the Hamilton equations of motion of classical
mechanics in the form:

P5.- The matrix elements of the operators corresponding to the cartesian

d

d

∂bH
dthf | bpi | gi = −hf |
∂bxi | gi
∂bH
∂bpi | gi ,
dthf | bxi | gi = hf |

where bH is the hamiltonian operator, whereas the derivatives with

respect to operators are deﬁned as at point 3 of this chapter.

P6.- The operators bpi and cxk have the following commutators:

[bpi,cxk] = −i¯hδik,
[bpi,cpk] = 0,
[bxi,cxk] = 0

5

¯h = h/2π = 1.0546 × 10−27 erg.sec.

1.- The correspondence between classical and quantum quantities

This can be done by substituting xi, pk with bxi cpk. The function L is

supposed to be analytic (i.e., it can be developed in Taylor series). If
the L function does not contain mixed products xkpk, the operator ˆL
is directly hermitic.
Exemple:

T = (P3

i p2

i )/2m −→ bT = (P3

i bp2)/2m.

If L contains mixed products xipi and higher powers of them, ˆL is not
hermitic, and in this case L is substituted by ˆΛ, the hermitic part of
ˆL (ˆΛ is an autoadjunct operator).
Exemple:

w(xi, pi) =Pi pixi −→ bw = 1/2P3

i (bpibxi + bxibpi).

In addition, one can see that we have no time operator.
In quan-
tum mechanics, time is only a parameter that can be introduced in
many ways. This is so because time does not depend on the canonical
variables, merely the latter depend on time.

2.- Probability in the discrete part of the spectrum
If ψn is an eigenfunction of the operator ˆL, then:

L =< n | ˆL | n >=< n | λn | n >= λn < n | n >= δnnλn = λn.

Moreover, one can prove that L
If the function φ is not an eigenfunction of ˆL, one can make use of the
expansion in the complete system of eigenfunctions of ˆL to get:

= (λn)k.

k

ˆLψn = λnψn,

φ =Pn anψn

and combining these two relationships one gets:

ˆLφ =Pn λnanψn.

6

In this way, one is able to calculate the matrix elements of the operator
ˆL:

hφ | ˆL | φi =Pn,m a∗manλnhm | ni =Pm | am |2 λm,

telling us that the result of the experiment is λm with a probability
| am |2.
If the spectrum is discrete, according to P4 this means that | am |2,
that is the coeﬃcients of the expansion in a complete set of eigenfunc-
tions, determine the probabilitities to observe the eigenvalue λn.
If the spectrum is continuous, using the following deﬁnition

φ(τ ) =R a(λ)ψ(τ, λ)dλ,

one can calculate the matrix elements in the continuous part of the
spectrum

hφ | ˆL | φi

=R dτR a∗(λ)ψ∗(τ, λ)dλR µa(µ)ψ(τ, µ)dµ
=R R a∗a(µ)µR ψ∗(τ, λ)ψ(tau, µ)dλdµdτ

=R R a∗(λ)a(µ)µδ(λ − µ)dλdµ

=R a∗(λ)a(λ)λdλ
=R | a(λ) |2 λdλ.

In the continuous case, | a(λ) |2 should be understood as the probabil-
ity density for observing the eigenvalue λ belonging to the continuous
spectrum. Moreover, the following holds

L = hφ | ˆL | φi.

One usually says that hµ | Φi is the representation of | Φi in the
reprezentation µ, where | µi is an eigenvector of ˆM .

Which is the explicit form of cp1, cp2 and cp3, if the arguments of the

= [bpi, bxi]bxi + bxi[bpi, bxi]
= −i¯hbxi − i¯hbxi = −2i¯hbxi.

In general, the following holds:

5.- Calculation of the normalization constant

Any wavefunction ψ(x) ∈ L2 of variable x can be written in the form:

ψ(x) =R δ(x − ξ)ψ(ξ)dξ

that can be considered as the expansion of ψ in eigenfunction of the
operator position (cartesian coordinate) ˆxδ(x − ξ) = ξ(x − ξ). Thus,
| ψ(x) |2 is the probability density of the coordinate in the state ψ(x).
From here one gets the interpretation of the norm

k ψ(x) k2=R | ψ(x) |2 dx = 1.

∂xi

Intuitively, this relationship tells us that the system described by ψ(x)
should be encountered at a certain point on the real axis, although we
can know only approximately the location.
The eigenfunctions of the momentum operator are:
−i¯h ∂ψ
¯h pixi. x and p
have continuous spectra and therefore the normalization is performed
by means of the “Dirac delta function.
Which is the explicit way of getting the normalization constant ?
This is a matter of the following Fourier transforms:

= piψ, and by integrating one gets ψ(xi) = A exp

f (k) =R g(x) exp−ikx dx, g(x) = 1

2πR f (k) expikx dk.

It can also be obtained with the following procedure. Consider the

Moreover, the eigenfunctions of the momentum form a complete sys-

class.

It is worth noting that ˆx and ˆp, although hermitic operators for all
f(x) ∈ L2, are not hermitic for their own eigenfunctions.
If ˆpa(p) = poa(p) and ˆx = ˆx† ˆp = ˆp†, then

< a | ˆpˆx | a > − < a | ˆxˆp | a >= −i¯h < a | a >

po[< a | ˆx | a > − < a | ˆx | a >] = −i¯h < a | a >

po[< a | ˆx | a > − < a | ˆx | a >] = 0

The left hand side is zero, whereas the right hand side is indeﬁnite,
which is a contradiction.

7.- Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg representations

The equations of motion given by P5 have diﬀerent interpretations

both to wavefunctions and operators. We shall consider herein only
the ﬁrst two cases.

• For an operator depending on time bO = dO(t) we have:

,

∂ ˆpi

∂ ˆxi

ˆxi = ∂bH
ˆpi = − ∂bH
[ˆp, f ] = ˆpf − f ˆp = −i¯h ∂f
[ˆx, f ] = ˆxf − f ˆx = −i¯h ∂f

∂ ˆxi

∂ ˆpi

and the Heisenberg equations of motion are easily obtained:

ˆpi = −i

¯h [ˆp, bH],

ˆxi = −i

¯h [ˆx, bH].

12

• If the wavefunctions are time dependent one can still use ˆpi =
¯h [ ˆpi, bH], because being a consequence of the commutation rela-

−i
tions it does not depend on representation

d

dt < f | ˆpi | g >= −i

¯h < f | [ˆp, bH] | g >.

If now ˆpi and bH does not depend on time and taking into account

the hermiticity one gets:

= −i

= −i

∂t , ˆpig) + ( ˆpif, ∂g

¯h (f, ˆH ˆpig)
¯h ( ˆHf, ˆpig)
∂t − i

¯h

¯h

ˆHg) = 0

The latter relationship holds for any pair of functions f (x) and
g(x) at the initial moment if each of them satisfy the equation

i¯h ∂ψ

∂t = Hψ.

This is the Schr¨odinger equation.
It describes the system by
means of time-independent operators and makes up the so-called
Schr¨odinger reprezentation.

In both reprezentations the temporal evolution of the system is char-

function of classical mechanics.

P5 is correct in both Schr¨odinger’s reprezentation and Heisenberg’s.
This is why, the mean value of any observable coincides in the two

−i ˆHt

reprezentations. Thus, there is a unitary transformation that can be
used for passing from one to the other. Such a transformation is of the
form ˆs† = exp
¯h . In order to pass to the Schr¨odinger reprezenta-
tion one should use the Heisenberg transform ψ = ˆs†f with f and
ˆL, whereas to pass to Heisenberg’s reprezentation the Schr¨odinger
transform ˆΛ = ˆs† ˆLˆs with ψ and ˆΛ is of usage. One can obtain the
Schr¨odinger equation as follows: since in the transformation ψ = ˆs†f
the function f does not depend on time, we shall derivate the trans-
formation with respect to time to get:

∂ψ

∂t = ∂s†

∂t f = ∂

¯h f = −i

¯h bHψ.

i¯h ∂ψ

∂t = bHψ.

Next we get the Heisenberg equations: putting the Schr¨odinger trans-
form in the form ˆsˆΛ ˆs† = ˆL and performing the derivatives with respect
to time one gets Heisenberg’s equation

∂ ˆL
∂t = ∂ ˆs

∂t = i

¯h [bH, ˆL].

Thus, we have:

Moreover, Heisenberg’s equation can be written in the form:

∂ ˆL
∂t = i

¯h [bH, ˆL].

∂ ˆL
∂t = i

¯h ˆs[bH, ˆΛ] ˆs†.

14

ˆL is known as an integral of motion, which, if d
characterized by the following commutators:

dt < ψ | ˆL | ψ >= 0, is

9.- Stationary states

[bH, ˆL] = 0,

[bH, ˆΛ] = 0.

The states of a quantum system described by the eigenfunctions of bH

are called stationary states and the corresponding set of eigenvalues
is known as the energy spectrum of the system.
In such cases, the
Schroedinger equation is:

i¯h ∂ψn

∂t = Enψn = bHψn.

The solutions are of the form:

ψn(x, t) = exp

−iEnt

¯h φn(x).

• The probability is the following:

−iEnt

δ(x) =| ψn(x, t) |2=| exp
= exp

¯h φn(x) |2
| φn(x) |2=| φn(x) |2.

−iEnt

Thus, the probability is constant in time.

• In the stationary states, the mean value of any commutator of
the form [bH, ˆA] is zero, where ˆA is an arbitrary operator:
< n | bH ˆA − ˆAbH | n >=< n | bH ˆA | n > − < n | ˆAbH | n >

=< n | En ˆA | n > − < n | ˆAEn | n >

= En < n | ˆA | n > −En < n | ˆA | n >= 0.

operator of a particle in the ﬁeld U (r), using

• The virial theorem in quantum mechanics - if bH is a hamiltonian
ˆA = 1/2P3

i=1( ˆpi ˆxi − ˆxi ˆpi) one gets:

15

< ψ | [ ˆA, bH] | ψ >= 0 =< ψ | ˆAbH − bH ˆA | ψ >
=P3
i=1 < ψ | ˆpi ˆxibH − bH ˆpi ˆxi | ψ >
=P3
i=1 < ψ | [bH, ˆxi] ˆpi + ˆxi[bH, ˆpi] | ψ >.

Using several times the commutators and ˆpi = −i¯h∇i, ˆH =
bT + U (r), one can get:

< ψ | [ ˆA, bH] | ψ >= 0

= −i¯h(2 < ψ | bT | ψ > − < ψ | ~r · ∇U (r) | ψ >).

This is the virial theorem. If the potential is U (r) = Uorn, then
a form of the virial theorem similar to that in classical mechanics
can be obtained with the only diﬀerence that it refers to mean
values

T = n

2 U .

m < n | ˆp | k >.

10.- The nonrelativistic probability current density

The following integral:

R | ψn(x) |2 dx = 1,

is the normalization of an eigenfunction of the discrete spectrum in
the coordinate reprezentation. It appears as a condition on the micro-
scopic motion in a ﬁnite region of space.
For the wavefunctions of the continuous spectrum ψλ(x) one cannot
give a direct probabilistic interpretation.
Let us consider a given wavefunction φ ∈ L2, that we write as a linear
combination of eigenfunctions of the continuum:

16

φ =R a(λ)ψλ(x)dx.

One says that φ corresponds to an inﬁnite motion.
In many cases, the function a(λ) is not zero only in a small neighbor-
hood of a point λ = λo. In such a case, φ is known as a wavepacket.
We shall calculate now the rate of change of the probability of ﬁnding
the system in the volume Ω.

P =RΩ | ψ(x, t) |2 dx =RΩ ψ∗(x, t)ψ(x, t)dx.

Derivating of the integral with respect to time one ﬁnds:

dP

dt =RΩ(ψ ∂ψ∗

∂t + ψ∗ ∂ψ

∂t )dx.

Using now the Schr¨odinger equation in the integral of the right hand
side, one gets:

dP

dt = i

¯hRΩ(ψ ˆHψ∗ − ψ∗ ˆHψ)dx.

Using the identity f∇2g − g∇2f = div[(f )grad(g) − (g)grad(f )] and
also the Schr¨odinger equation in the form:

2m∇2ψ
and subtituting in the integral, one gets:

2m (ψ∇ψ∗ − ψ∗∇ψ)dx.

By means of the divergence theorem, the volume integral can be trans-
formed in a surface one leading to:

17

dP

dt = −H i¯h
The quantity ~J(ψ) = i¯h
2m (ψ∇ψ∗ − ψ∗∇ψ) is known as the probability
density current, for which one can easily get the following continuity
equation

2m (ψ∇ψ∗ − ψ∗∇ψ)dx.

dt + div( ~J ) = 0.

11.- Operator of spatial transport

If bH is invariant at translations of arbitrary vector ~a,

bH(~r + ~a) = bH ~(r) ,

then there is an operator bT (~a) which is unitary bT †(~a)bH(~r)bT (~a) =
bH(~r + ~a).

Commutativity of translations

In the inﬁnitezimal case:

bT (~a)bT (~b) = bT (~b)bT (~a) = bT (~a + ~b),
implies that bT is of the form bT = expiˆka, where ˆk = ˆp

12.- Exemple: The ‘crystal’ (lattice) Hamiltonian

If bH is invariant for a discrete translation (for exemple, in a crystal
lattice) bH(~r + ~a) = bH(~r), where ~a = Pi ~aini, ni ∈ N and ai are

baricentric vectors, then:

bH(~r)ψ(~r) = Eψ(~r),

bH(~r + ~a)ψ(~r + ~a) = Eψ(~r + ~a) = ˆH(~r)ψ(~r + ~a).

Consequently, ψ(~r) and ψ(~r +~a) are wavefunctions for the same eigen-

value of bH. The relationship between ψ(~r) and ψ(~r +~a) can be saught

for in the form ψ(~r + ~a) = ˆc(~a)ψ(~r), where ˆc(~a) is a gxg matrix (g is
the order of degeneration of level E). Two column matrices, ˆc(~a) and
ˆc(~b) commute and therefore they are diagonalizable simultaneously.
Moreover, for the diagonal elements, cii(~a)cii(~b) = cii(~a + ~b) holds
for i=1,2,....,g, having solutions of the type cii(a) = expikia. Thus,
ψk(~r) = Uk(~r) expi~k~a, where ~k is a real arbitrary vector and the func-
tion Uk(~r) is periodic of period ~a, Uk(~r + ~a) = Uk(~r).
The assertion that the eigenfunctions of a periodic ˆH of the lattice
type ˆH(~r + ~a) = ˆH(~r) can be written ψk(~r) = Uk(~r) exp i~k~a, where
Uk(~r + ~a) = Uk(~r) is known as Bloch’s theorem.
In the continuous
case, Uk should be constant, because the constant is the only function
periodic for any ~a. The vector ~p = ¯h~k is called quasimomentum (by
analogy with the continuous case). The vector ~k is not determined
univoquely, because one can add any vector ~g for which ga = 2πn,
where n ∈ N .

1P. Problems

Problema 1.1: Let us consider two operators, A and B, which commutes
by hypothesis. In this case, one can derive the following relationship:

eAeB = e(A+B)e(1/2[A,B]).

Solution

20

dt = AeAteBt + eAtBeBt = (A + eAtBe−At)F (t).

Deﬁning an operator F(t), as a function of real variable t, of the form:
F (t) = e(At)e(Bt),
then: dF
Applying now the formula [A, F (B)] = [A, B]F
[eAt, B] = t[A.B]eAt, and therefore: eAtB = BeAt + t[A, B]eAt .
Multiplying both sides of the latter equation by exp−At and substituting in
the ﬁrst equation, we get:

(B), we have

′

dF
dt = (A + B + t[A, B])F (t).

The operators A , B and [A,B] commutes by hypothesis. Thus, we can
integrate the diﬀerential equation as if A + B and [A, B] would be scalar
numbers.
We shall have:

F (t) = F (0)e(A+B)t+1/2[A,B]t2

.

Putting t = 0, one can see that F (0) = 1 and therefore :

F (t) = e(A+B)t+1/2[A,B]t2

.

Putting now t = 1, we get the ﬁnal result.

Problem 1.2: Calculate the commutator [X, Dx].

Solution

∂x − ∂
∂x ψ(~r) − ψ(~r) − x ∂

The calculation is performed by applying the commutator to an arbitrary
function ψ(~r):
[X, Dx]ψ(~r) = (x ∂
= x ∂
Since this relationship is satisﬁed for any ψ(~r), one can conclude that [X, Dx] =
−1.
Problem 1.3: Check that the trace of a matrix is invariant of changes of
discrete orthonormalized bases.

∂x x)ψ(~r) = x ∂
∂x ψ(~r) = −ψ(~r).

∂x ψ(~r) − ∂

∂x [xψ(~r)]

Solution

The sum of the diagonal elements of a matrix representation of an operator
A in an arbitrary basis does not depend on the basis.

21

This important property can be obtained by passing from an orthonormal-
ized discrete basis | ui > to another orthonormalized discrete basis | tk >.
We have:
Pi < ui | A | ui >=Pi < ui | (Pk | tk >< tk |) A | ui >

(where we have used the completeness relationship for the states tk). The
right hand side is:

(the change of the order in the product of two scalar numbers is allowed).

Pi,j < ui | tk >< tk | A | ui >=Pi,j < tk | A | ui >< ui | tk >,
Thus, we can replace Pi | ui >< ui | with unity (i.e., the completeness
relationship for the states | ui >), in order to get ﬁnally:
< tk | A | tk > .

< ui | A | ui >=Xk

Xi

Thus, we have proved the invariance property for matriceal traces.

Problem 1.4: If for the hermitic operator N there are the hermitic oper-
[M, N ] = 0, [L, N ] = 0, [M, L] 6= 0, then the
ators L and M such that :
eigenfunctions of N are degenerate.

Solution

Let ψ(x; µ, ν) be the common eigenfunctions of M and N (since they com-
mute they are simultaneous observables). Let ψ(x; λ, ν) be the common
eigenfunctions of L and N (again, since they commute they are simulta-
neous observables). The Greek parameters denote the eigenvalues of the
corresponding operators. Let us consider for simplicity sake that N has a
discrete spectrum. Then:

We calculate now the matrix element < f|M L|f >:

f (x) =Xν
< f|M L|f >=Z Xν

µνaν ψ∗(x; µ, ν)Xν′

)dx .

If all the eigenfunctions of N are nondegenerate then < f|M L|f >=Pν µνaνλνbν .
But the same result can be obtained if one calculates < f|LM|f > and the
commutator would be zero. Thus, at least some of the eigenfunctions of N
should be degenerate.

This condition corresponds to segments of the real axis which would be
prohibited to any particle from the viewpoint of classical mechanics. In this
case, one introduces the positive constant q deﬁned by:

q = p2m(V − E)

¯h

and the solution of (1) can be written:

ψ(x) = Beqx + B′e−qx ,

where B and B′ are complex constants.

(iii) E = V

In this special case, ψ(x) is a linear function of x.

The behaviour of ψ(x) at a discontinuity of the potential

One might think that at the point x = x1, where the potential V (x) is
discontinuous, the wavefunction ψ(x) behaves in a more strange way, maybe
discontinuously for example. This is not so: ψ(x) and dψ
dx are continuous,
and only the second derivative is discontinuous at x = x1.

General look to the calculations

The procedure to determine the stationary states in rectangular poten-
tials is the following: in all regions in which V (x) is constant we write ψ(x)
in any of the two forms (3) or (5) depending on application; next, we join
smoothly these functions according to the continuity conditions for ψ(x) and
dψ
dx at the points where V (x) is discontinuous.

Examination of several simple cases

Let us make explicite calculations for some simple stationary states

according to the proposed method.

The solution of eq. (1) has the form of eq. (3) in the regions I(x < 0)

and II(x > 0):

¯h2 [V0 − E]φ(x) = ψ′′(x) − q2ψ(x) = 0

If we limit ourselves to the case of an incident particle ‘coming’ from x =
−∞, we have to choose A′2 = 0 and we can determine the ratios A′1/A1 and
A2/A1. The joining conditions give then:

• ψI = ψII ,

at x = 0 :

• ψ′I = ψ′II ,

at x = 0 :

A1 + A′1 = A2

A1ik1 − A′1ik1 = A2ik2

Substituting A1 and A′1 from (8) in (9):

ψ(x) is a superposition of two waves. The ﬁrst (the A1 part) corresponds
to an incident wave of momentum p = ¯hk1, propagating from the left to
the right. The second (the A′1 part) corresponds to a reﬂected particle of
momentum −¯hk1 propagating in opposite direction. Since we have already
chosen A′2 = 0, it follows that ψII (x) contains a single wave, which is as-
sociated to a transmitted particle. (We will show later how it is possible
by employing the concept of probability current to deﬁne the transmission
coeﬃcient T as well as the reﬂection coeﬃcient R for the step potential).
These coeﬃcients give the probability that a particle coming from x = −∞
can pass through or get back from the step at x = 0. Thus, we obtain:

whereas for T :

R = |

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

It is easy to check that R + T = 1. It is thus sure that the particle will
be either transmitted or reﬂected. Contrary to the predictions of classical
mechanics, the incident particle has a nonzero probability of not going back.
It is also easy to check using (6), (7) and (17), that if E ≫ V0 then
T ≃ 1: when the energy of the particle is suﬃcently big in comparison with
the height of the step, everything happens as if the step does not exist for
the particle.

whereas in the region II(x > 0), the same eq. (1) [now written as ψ(x)′′ −

ψI = A1eik1x + A′1e−ik1x ,

ψII = B2eq2x + B′2e−q2x .

(24)

In order that the solution be kept ﬁnite when x → +∞, it necessary that:
(25)

B2 = 0 .

The joining condition at x = 0 give now:

• ψI = ψII ,

at x = 0 :

• ψ′I = ψ′II ,

at x = 0 :

As in classical mechanics, the microparticle is always reﬂected (total re-
ﬂexion). However, there is an important diﬀerence, namely, because of the
existence of the so-called evanescent wave e−q2x, the particle has a nonzero
probability to ﬁnd itself in a spatial region which is classicaly forbidden. This
probability decays exponentially with x and turns to be negligible when x
overcome 1/q2 corresponding to the evanescent wave. Notice also that A′1/A1
is a complex quantity. A phase diﬀerence occurs as a consequence of the
reﬂexion, which physically is due to the fact that the particle is slowed down
when entering the region x > 0. There is no analog phenomenon for this in
classical mechanics (but there is of course such an analog in optical physics).

If we limit ourselves to the case of an incident particle coming from

The joining conditions at x = a give A2 and A′2 as functions of A3, whereas
those at x = 0 give A1 and A′1 as functions of A2 and A′2 (thus, as functions
of A3). This procedure is shown in detail in the following.
Substituting A′2 from eq. (37) in (38) leads to:

Since ψ(x) should be ﬁnite in region III as well, we require B3 = 0. Thus

[

e−ika = e2ika .

(61)

Because q and k depend on E, eq. (1) can be satisﬁed for some particular
values of E. The condition that ψ(x) should be ﬁnite in all spatial regions
imposes the quantization of the energy. Two cases are possible:

(i) if

q − ik
q + ik

= −eika ,

equating in both sides the real and the imaginary parts, respectively, we

The energy levels are determined by the intersection of a straight line of

with the ﬁrst set of cosinusoides ˆıntrerupte in ﬁg. 2.4. Thus, we get
k0
a certain number of energy levels whose wavefunctions are even. This fact
becomes clearer if we substitute (62) in (58) and (60). It is easy to check
that B′3 = B1 and A2 = A′2 leading to ψ(−x) = ψ(x).

easily show that the corresponding wavefunctions are odd.

ψ(x) should be zero outside the interval [0, a] and continuous at x = 0 and

For 0 ≤ x ≤ a:

ψ(x) = Aeikx + A′e−ikx .

(70)

Since ψ(0) = 0, one can infer that A′ = −A, leading to:

ψ(x) = 2iA sin(kx) .

Moreover, ψ(a) = 0 and therefore

k =

2P. Problems

Problem 2.1: The attractive δ potential

Suppose we have a potential of the form:

V (x) = −V0δ(x);

V0 > 0;

x ∈ ℜ.

36

The corresponding wavefunction ψ(x) is assumed continuous.

a) Obtain the bound states (E < 0), if they exist, localized in this type

of potential.

b) Calculate the dispersion of a plane wave falling on the δ potential and

obtain the reﬂexion coeﬃcient

R = |ψref l|2

|ψinc|2 |x=0 ,

where ψref l, ψinc are the reﬂected and incoming waves, respectively.
Suggestion: To determine the behavior of ψ(x) in x=0, it is better to proceed
by integrating the Schr¨odinger equation in the interval (−ε, +ε), and then
to apply the limit ε → 0.

Solution. a) The Schr¨odinger eq. is:

2m
¯h2 (E + V0δ(x))ψ(x) = 0 .
Far from the origin we have a diﬀerential eq. of the form

d2
dx2 ψ(x) +

2mE
¯h2 ψ(x).
Consequently, the wavefunctions are of the form

d2
dx2 ψ(x) = −

(75)

(76)

ψ(x) = Ae−qx + Beqx

for

x > 0

and

x < 0,

(77)

where q =q−2mE/¯h2 ∈ ℜ. Since |ψ|2 should be L2 integrable , we cannot

accept that a part growths exponentially. Moreover, the wavefunction should
be continuous at the origin. With these conditions, we have

ψ(x) = Aeqx;
ψ(x) = Ae−qx;

(x < 0),

(x > 0).

Integrating the Schr¨odinger eq. between −ε and +ε, we get

It moves from the left to the right and is reﬂected by the potential. If B and
C are the amplitudes of the reﬂected and transmitted waves, respectively,
then we have

ψ(x) = Aeikx + Be−ikx;
ψ(x) = Ceikx;

(x < 0),

(x > 0).

(82)

If the potential is very strong (V0 → ∞), one can see that R → 1, i.e., the
wave is totally reﬂected.

T = |ψtrans|2

|ψinc|2 |x=0 = |C|2
|A|2 =

(85)

Again, if the potential is very strong (V0 → ∞) then T → 0,i.e., the trans-
mitted wave fades rapidly on the other side of the potential.
In addition, R + T = 1 as expected, which is a check of the calculation.

b) Formulation of the boundary conditions.

The normalization of the bound states requires solutions going to zero at
inﬁnity. This means that B1 = A3 = 0. Moreover, ψ(x) should be continu-
ously diﬀerentiable. All the particular solutions are ﬁxed in such a way that
ψ and ψ′ are continuous for that value of x corresponding to the boundary
between the interior and exterior regions. The second derivative ψ′′ displays
the discontinuity that the ‘box’ potential imposes. Thus we are led to:

ψ1(−a) = ψ2(−a),
ψ′1(−a) = ψ′2(−a),

ψ2(a) = ψ3(a),
ψ′2(a) = ψ′3(a).

(88)

c) The eigenvalue equations.
From (88) we get four linear and homogeneous eqs for the coeﬃcients

A1, A2, B2 and B3:

A1e−qa = A2 cos(ka) − B2 sin(ka),
qA1e−qa = A2k sin(ka) + B2k cos(ka),
B3e−qa = A2 cos(ka) + B2 sin(ka),

−qB3e−qa = −A2k sin(ka) + B2k cos(ka).

(89)

Adding and subtracting one gets a system of eqs. which is easier to solve:

(A1 + B3)e−qa = 2A2 cos(ka)
q(A1 + B3)e−qa = 2A2k sin(ka)
(A1 − B3)e−qa = −2B2 sin(ka)
q(A1 − B3)e−qa = 2B2k cos(ka).
Assuming A1 + B3 6= 0 and A2 6= 0, the ﬁrst two eqs give

q = k tan(ka) ,

which inserted in the last two eqs gives

A1 = B3;

B2 = 0.

40

(90)

(91)

(92)

The result is the symmetric solution ψ(x) = ψ(−x), also called of positive
parity.

A similar calculation for A1 − B3 6= 0 and B2 6= 0 leads to
A2 = 0.

y

q = −k cot(ka)

A1 = −B3;

(93)

The obtained wavefunction is antisymmetric, corresponding to a negative
parity

d) Quantitative solution of the eigenvalue problem.
The equation connecting q and k, already obtained previously, gives the

condition to get the eigenvalues. Using the notation

ξ = ka,

η = qa,

from the deﬁnition (87) we get

ξ2 + η2 =

2mV0a2

¯h2

= r2.

(94)

(95)

On the other hand, using (91) and (93) we get the equations

η = ξ tan(ξ),

η = −ξ cot(ξ).

Thus, the sought energy eigenvalues can be obtained from the intersections
of these two curves with the circle deﬁned by (95) in the plane ξ-η (see ﬁg.
2.6).

There is at least one solution for arbitrary values of the parameter V0,

a certain lower bound for the two curves to intersect. Thus, the potential
should have a certain depth related to a given spatial scale a and a given
mass scale m, to allow for negative parity solutions. The number of energy
levels grows with V0, a, and m. For the case in which mV a2 → ∞, the
intersections are obtained from

Widening the well and/or the mass of the particle m, the diference between

point energy.

for a particle in a potential well of inﬁnite

V (x) =( 0

for x′ < x < x′ + 2a

∞ for x′ ≥ x o x ≥ x′ + 2a.

The solution in its general form is

where

ψ(x) = A sin(kx) + B cos(kx) ,

k =s 2mE

¯h2

.

Since ψ should fulﬁll ψ(x′) = ψ(x′ + 2a) = 0, we get:

A sin(kx′) + B cos(kx′) = 0
A sin[k(x′ + 2a)] + B cos[k(x′ + 2a)] = 0 .

(99)

(100)

(101)

(102)

Multiplying (101) by sin[k(x′ +2a)] and (102) by sin(kx′) and next subtract-
ing the latter result from the ﬁrst we get:

B[ cos(kx′) sin[k(x′ + 2a)] − cos[k(x′ + 2a)] sin(kx′) ] = 0 ,

(103)

and by means of a trigonometric identity:

B sin(2ak) = 0

(104)

Multiplying (101) by cos[k(x′ + 2a)] and subtracting (102) multiplied by
cos(kx′) leads to:

A[

sin(kx′) cos[k(x′ + 2a)] − sin[k(x′ + 2a)] cos(kx′) ] = 0 ,

(105)

and by means of the same trigonometric identity:

A sin[k(−2ak)] = A sin[k(2ak)] = 0 .

(106)

Since we do not take into account the trivial solution ψ = 0, using (104)
and (106) one has sin(2ak) = 0 that takes place only if 2ak = nπ, with n an

43

integer. Accordingly, k = nπ/2a and since k2 = 2mE/¯h2 then it comes out
that the eigenvalues are given by the following expression:

E =

¯h2π2n2
8a2m

.

(107)

The energy is quantized because only for each kn = nπ/2a one gets a well-
deﬁned energy En = [n2/2m][π¯h/2a]2.
The general form of the solution is:

ψn = A sin(

nπx

),

and it can be normalized

1 =Z x′+2a

ψψ∗dx = a(A2 + B2),

Substituting this value of A in (101) one gets:

3. ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND SPIN

Introduction

It is known from Classical Mechanics that the angular momentum l for
macroscopic particles is given by

l = r × p,

(1)

where r and p are the radius vector and the linear momentum, respectively.
However, in Quantum Mechanics, one can ﬁnd operators of angular mo-
mentum type (OOAMT), which are not compulsory expressed only in terms
of the coordinate ˆxj and the momentum ˆpk and acting only on the eigenfunc-
tions in the x reprezentation. Consequently, it is very important to settle
ﬁrst of all general commutation relations for the OOAMT components.

In Quantum Mechanics l is expressed by the operator

whose components are operators satisfying the following commutation rules

l = −i¯hr × ∇,

(2)

[lx, ly] = ilz,

[ly, lz] = ilx,

[lz, lx] = ily.

(3)

Moreover, each of the components commutes with the square of the angular
momentum, i.e.

l2 = l2

x + l2

y + l2
z,

[li, l2] = 0,

i = 1, 2, 3.

(4)

These relations, besides being correct for the angular momentum, are ful-
ﬁlled for the important OOAMT class of spin operators, which miss exact
analogs in classical mechanics.
These commutation relations are fundamental for getting the spectra of the
aforementioned operators as well as for their diﬀerential reprezentations.

The angular momentum

For an arbitrary point of a ﬁxed space (FS), one can introduce a function
ψ(x, y, z), for which let’s consider two cartesian systems Σ and Σ′, where Σ′
is obtained by the rotation of the z axis of Σ.

45

In the general case, a FS refers to a coordinate system, which is diﬀerent

of Σ and Σ′.

Now, let’s compare the values of ψ at two points of the FS with the same
coordinates (x,y,z) in Σ and Σ′, which is equivalent to the vectorial rotation

ψ(x′, y′, z′) = Rψ(x, y, z)

where R is a rotation matrix in R3

Then

Rψ(x, y, z) = ψ(x cos φ − y sin φ, x sin φ + y cos φ, z).

(5)

(6)

(7)

On the other hand, it is important to recall that the wavefunctions do not
depend on the coordinate system and that the transformation at rotations
within the FS is achieved by means of unitary operators. Thus, to determine
the form of the unitary operator U†(φ) that passes ψ to ψ′, one usually
considers an inﬁnitesimal rotation dφ, keeping only the linear terms in dφ
when one expands ψ′ in Taylor series in the neighborhood of x

ψ(x′, y′, z′) ≈ ψ(x + ydφ, xdφ + y, z),
∂ψ
∂x − x

≈ ψ(x, y, z) + dφ(cid:18)y
≈ (1 − idφlz)ψ(x, y, z),

∂ψ

∂y(cid:19) ,

where we have used the notation1

lz = ¯h−1(ˆxˆpy − ˆy ˆpx).

(8)

(9)

As one will see later, this corresponds to the projection operator onto z of
the angular momentum according to the deﬁnition (2) unless the factor ¯h−1.
In this way, the rotations of ﬁnite angle φ can be represented as exponentials
of the form

where

ψ(x′, y′, z) = eilzφψ(x, y, z),

ˆU†(φ) = eilzφ.

(10)

(11)

1The proof of (8) is displayed as problem 3.1

46

In order to reassert the concept of rotation, we will consider it in a more
ˆ~A acting on ψ,
general approach with the help of the vectorial operator
assuming that ˆAx, ˆAy, ˆAz have the same form in Σ and Σ′, that is, the
ˆ~A as calculated in Σ and Σ′ should be equal when they are
mean values of
seen from the FS

Z ψ∗(~r′)( ˆAxˆı′ + ˆAy ˆ′ + ˆAz ˆk′)ψ∗(~r′) d~r

=Z ψ∗(~r)( ˆAxˆı + ˆAy ˆ + ˆAz ˆk)ψ∗(~r) d~r,

(12)

where

ˆı′ = ˆı cos φ + ˆ sin φ,

ˆ′ = ˆı sin φ + ˆ cos φ,

ˆk′ = ˆk.

(13)

Thus, by combining (10), (12) and (13) we get

eilzφ ˆAxe−ilzφ = ˆAx cos φ − ˆAy sin φ,
eilz φ ˆAye−ilzφ = ˆAx sin φ − ˆAy cos φ,
eilzφ ˆAze−ilzφ = ˆAz.

(14)

Again, considering inﬁnitesimal rotations and expanding the left hand
sides in (14), one can determine the commutation relations of ˆAx, ˆAy and
ˆAz with ˆlz

[lz, Ax] = iAy,

[lz, Ay] = −iAx,

[lz, Az] = 0,

(15)

and similarly for lx and ly.

The basic conditions to obtain these commutation relations are

⋆ The eigenfunctions transform as in (7) when Σ → Σ′.
⋆ The components ˆAx, ˆAy, ˆAz have the same form in Σ and Σ′.

⋆ The kets corresponding to the mean values of ˆA in Σ and Σ′ coincide

(are the same) for a FS observer.

One can also use another representation in which ψ(x, y, z) does not
change when Σ → Σ′ and the vectorial operators transform as ordinary
In order to pass to such a representation when we rotate by φ
vectors.
around z one makes use of the operator ˆU (φ), that is

47

and therefore

eilzφψ′(x, y, z) = ψ(x, y, z),

e−ilzφ ˆ~Aeilzφ =

ˆ~A.

Using the relationships (14) we obtain

ˆA′x = ˆAx cos φ + ˆAy sin φ = e−ilzφ ˆAxeilz φ,
ˆA′y = − ˆAx sin φ + ˆAy cos φ = e−ilzφ ˆAyeilzφ,
ˆA′z = e−ilzφ ˆAzeilzφ.

(16)

(17)

(18)

Since the transformations of the new reprezentation are performed by

means of unitary operators, the commutation relations do not change.

Remarks

⋆ The operator ˆA2 is invariant at rotations, that is

e−ilzφ ˆA2eilz φ = ˆA′2 = ˆA2 .

⋆ It follows that

[ˆli, ˆA2] = 0 .

⋆ If the Hamiltonian operator is of the form

ˆH =

1
2m

ˆp2 + U (|~r|),

(19)

(20)

(21)

then it remains invariant under rotations in any axis passing through
the coordinate origin

[ˆli, ˆH] = 0 ,

(22)

where ˆli are integrals of the motion.

Deﬁnition
If ˆAi are the components of a vectorial operator acting on a wavefunction
depending only on the coordinates and if there are operators ˆli that satisfy
the following commutation relations

[ˆli, ˆAj] = iεijk ˆAk,

[ˆli, ˆlj] = iεijkˆlk ,

(23)

48

then ˆli are known as the components of the angular momentum operator
and we can infer from (20) and (23) that

[ˆli, ˆl2] = 0.

(24)

Consequently the three operatorial components associated to the com-
ponents of a classical angular momentum satisfy commutation relations of
the type (23), (24). Moreover, one can prove that these relations lead to
speciﬁc geometric properties of the rotations in a 3D euclidean space. This
takes place if we adopt a more general point of view by deﬁning an angular
momentum operator J (we shall not use the hat symbol for simplicity of
writing) as any set of three observables Jx, Jy ¸si Jz which fulﬁll the com-
mutation relations

Moreover, let us introduce the operator

[Ji, Jj ] = iεijkJk.

J2 = J 2

x + J 2

y + J 2
z ,

(25)

(26)

the scalar square of the angular momentum J. This operator is hermitic
because Jx, Jy and Jz are hermitic and it is easy to show that J2 commutes
with the three components of J

[J2, Ji] = 0.

(27)

Since J2 commutes with each of the components it follows that there is

a complete system of eigenfunctions, i.e.

J2ψγµ = f (γ2)ψγµ,

Jiψγµ = g(µ)ψγµ,

(28)

where, as it will be shown in the following, the eigenfunctions depend on two
subindices, which will be determined together with the form of the functions
f (γ) and g(µ). The operators Ji and Jk (i 6= k) do not commute, i.e. they do
not have common eigenfunctions. For physical and mathematical reasons,
we are interested to determine the common eigenfunctions of J2 and Jz,
that is, we shall take i = z in (28).

Instead of using the components Jx and Jy of the angular momentum J,

it is more convenient to work with the following linear combinations

J+ = Jx + iJy,

J− = Jx − iJy.

(29)

49

Contrary to the operators a and a† of the harmonic oscillator (see chapter
5), these operators are not hermitic, they are only adjunct to each other.
The following properties are easy to prove

[Jz, J±] = ±J±,
[J+, J−] = 2Jz,
[J 2, J+] = [J 2, J−] = [J 2, Jz] = 0.

Jz(J±ψγµ) = {J±Jz + [Jz, J±]}ψγµ = (µ ± 1)(J±ψγµ).

(30)

(31)

(32)

Therefore J±ψγµ are eigenfunctions of Jz corresponding to the eigenval-
ues µ ± 1, that is these functions are identical up to the constant factors αµ
and βµ (to be determined)

J+ψγµ−1 = αµψγµ,

J−ψγµ = βµψγµ−1.

On the other hand

α∗µ = (J+ψγµ−1, ψγµ) = (ψγµ−1J−ψγµ) = βµ .

(33)

(34)

Therefore, taking a phase of the type eia (where a is real) for the function
ψγµ one can put αµ real and equal to βµ, which means

J+ψγ,µ−1 = αµψγµ, J−ψγµ = αµψγ,µ−1,

(35)

and therefore

y + J 2

γ = (ψγµ, [J 2
a = (ψγµ, J 2
b = (ψγµ, J 2

z ]ψγµ) = µ2 + a + b,

x + J 2
x ψγµ) = (Jxψγµ, Jxψγµ) ≥ 0,
y ψγµ) = (Jyψγµ, Jyψγµ) ≥ 0.

The normalization constant cannot be negative. This implies

γ ≥ µ2,

(36)

(37)

for a ﬁxed γ; thus, µ has both superior and inferior limits (it takes values
in a ﬁnite interval).

Let Λ and λ be these limits, respectively, for a given γ

J+ψγΛ = 0,

J−ψγλ = 0.

(38)

50

Using the following operatorial identities

J−J+ = J2 − j2
J+J− = J2 − j2

z + Jz = J2 − Jz(Jz − 1),
z + Jz = J2 − Jz(Jz + 1),

acting on ψγΛ as well as on ψγλ one gets

γ − Λ2 − Λ = 0,
γ − λ2 + λ = 0,
(λ − λ + 1)(λ + λ) = 0.

In addition,

Λ ≥ λ → Λ = −λ = J → γ = J(J + 1).

(39)

(40)

(41)

For a given γ the projection µ of the momentum takes 2J + 1 values that
diﬀer by unity, from J to −J. Therefore, the diﬀerence Λ − λ = 2J should
be an integer and consequently the eigenvalues of Jz that are labelled by m
are integer

or half-integer

m = k,

k = 0,±1,±2, . . . ,

m = k +

2

,

k = 0,±1,±2, . . . .

(42)

(43)

A state having a given γ = J(J + 1) presents a degeneration of order
g = 2J + 1 with regard to the eigenvalues m (this is so because Ji, Jk
commute with J 2 but do not commute between themselves.

By a “state of angular momentum J” one usually understands a state
of γ = J(J + 1) having the maximum projection of its momentum, i.e. J.
Quite used notations for angular momentum states are ψjm and the Dirac
ket one |jmi.
Let us now obtain the matrix elements of Jx, Jy in the representation in
which J 2 and Jz are diagonal. In this case, one obtains from (35) and (39)
the following relations

J−J+ψjm−1 = αmJ−ψjm = αmψjm−1,
J(J + 1) − (m − 1)2 − (m − 1) = α2
m,
αm =q(J + m)(J − m + 1).

(44)

51

Combining (44) and (35) leads to

It follows that the matrix element of J+ is

and analogously

J+ψjm−1 =q(J + m)(J − m + 1)ψjm .
hjm|J+|jm − 1i =q(J + m)(J − m + 1)δnm,
hjn|J−|jmi = −q(J + m)(J − m + 1)δnm−1 .
2q(J + m)(J − m + 1),
2 q(J + m)(J − m + 1) .

hjm|Jx|jm − 1i =
hjm|Jy|jm − 1i = −i

Finally, from the deﬁnitions (29) for J+, J− one easily gets

Partial conclusions

α Properties of the eigenvalues of J and Jz

If j(j + 1)¯h2 and m¯h are eigenvalues of J and Jz associated to the
eigenvectors |kjmi, then j and m satisfy the inequality

−j ≤ m ≤ j.

β Properties of the vector J−|kjmi

Let |kjmi be an eigenvector of J2 and Jz with the eigenvalues j(j+1)¯h2
and m¯h

– (i) If m = −j, then J−|kj − ji = 0.
– (ii) If m > −j, then J−|kjmi is a nonzero eigenvector of J 2 and

Jz with the eigenvalues j(j + 1)¯h2 and (m − 1)¯h.

γ Properties of the vector J+|kjmi

Let |kjmi be a (ket) eigenvector of J2 and Jz for the eigenvalues
j(j + 1)¯h2 and m¯h

⋆ If m = j, then J+|kjmi = 0.
⋆ If m < j, then J+|kjmi is a nonzero eigenvector of J2 and Jz

with the eigenvalues j(j + 1)¯h2 ¸si (m + 1)¯h

δ Consequences of the previous properties

Jz|kjmi = m¯h|kjmi,
J+|kjmi = m¯hqj(j + 1) − m(m + 1)|kjm + 1i,
J−|kjmi = m¯hqj(j + 1) − m(m − 1)|kjm + 1i.

Applications of the orbital angular momentum

Until now we have considered those properties of the angular momentum
that could be derived only from the commutation relations. Let us go back
to the orbital momentum L of a particle without intrinsic rotation and let
us examine how one can apply the theory of the previous section in the
important particular case

[ˆli, ˆpj] = iεijk ˆpk.

(49)

First, ˆlz and ˆpj have a common system of eigenfunctions. On the other
hand, the Hamiltonian of a free particle

ˆH =  ˆ~p

√2m!2

,

being the square of a vectorial operator has a complete system of eigenfunc-
tions with ˆL2 and ˆlz. In addition, this implies that the free particle can be
found in a state of well-deﬁned E, l, and m.

Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of L2 and Lz

It is more convenient to work in spherical coordinates because, as we will
see, various angular momentum operators act only on the angle variables
θ, φ and not on r. Thus, instead of describing r by its cartesian compo-
nents x, y, z we determine the arbitrary point M of vector radius r by the
spherical 3D coordinates

x = r cos φ sin θ,

y = r sin φ sin θ,

z = r cos θ,

(50)

where

r ≥ 0,

0 ≤ θ ≤ π,

0 ≤ φ ≤ 2π.

53

Let Φ(r, θ, φ) and Φ′(r, θ, φ) be the wavefunctions of a particle in Σ and
Σ′, respectively, in which the inﬁnitesimal rotation is given by δα around
the z axis

or

It follows that

Φ′(r, θ, φ) = Φ(r, θ, φ + δα),

(67)

with k only integers or half-integers, but not for combinations of F (φ) and
G(φ). The correct choice of m is based on the common eigenfunctions of ˆlz
and ˆl2.

Spherical harmonics

In the {~r} representation, the eigenfunctions associated to the eigenvalues
l(l+1)¯h2 of L2 and m¯h of lz are solutions of the partial diﬀerential equations

(68)

Taking into account that the general results presented above can be
applied to the orbital momentum, we infer that l can be an integer or half-
integer and that, for ﬁxed l, m can only take the values

−l,−l + 1, . . . , l − 1, l.

In (68), r is not present in the diﬀerential operator, so that it can be
considered as a parameter. Thus, considering only the dependence on θ, φ
of ψ, one uses the notation Ylm(θ, φ) for these common eigenfunctions of L2
and lz, corresponding to the eigenvalues l(l + 1)¯h2, m¯h. They are known as
spherical harmonics.

L2Ylm(θ, φ) = l(l + 1)¯h2Ylm(θ, φ),
lzYlm(θ, φ) = m¯hYlm(θ, φ).

(69)

For more rigorousness, one should introduce one more index in order to
distinguish among the various solutions of (69) corresponding to the same
l, m pairs.
Indeed, as one will see next, these equations have a unique

56

solution (up to a constant factor) for each allowed pair of l, m; this is so
because the subindices l, m are suﬃcient in this context. The solutions
Ylm(θ, φ) have been found by the method of the separation of variables in
sperical variables (see also the chapter The hydrogen atom)

ψlm(r, θ, φ) = f (r)ψlm(θ, φ),

(70)

where f (r) is a function of r, which looks as an integration constant from
the viewpoint of the partial diﬀerential equations in (68). The fact that f (r)
is arbitrary proves that L2 and lz do not form a complete set of observables2
in the space εr

3 of functions of ~r (or of r, θ, φ).

In order to normalize ψlm(r, θ, φ), it is convenient to normalize Ylm(θ, φ)

and f (r) separately

∂φ

Ylm(θ, φ) = m¯hYlm(θ, φ).

(73)

Thus,

Ylm(θ, φ) = Flm(θ, φ)eimφ.

(74)
If 0 ≤ φ < 2π, then we should tackle the condition of covering all space
according to the requirement of dealing with a function continuous in any
angular zone, i.e. c˘a

Ylm(θ, φ = 0) = Ylm(θ, φ = 2π),

implying

eimπ = 1.

(75)

(76)

2By deﬁnition, the hermitic operator A is an observable if the orthogonal system of

eigenvectors form a base in the space of states.

3Each quantum state of a particle is characterized by a vectorial state belonging to an

abstract vectorial space εr.

57

As has been seen, m is either an integer or a half-integer; for the appli-
cation to the orbital momentum, m should be an integer. (e2imπ would be
−1 if m is a half-integer).
(β): For a given value of l, all the corresponding Ylm can be obtained by
algebraic means using

which combined with eq. (62) for l+ leads to

l+Yll(θ, φ) = 0,

(cid:18) d
dθ − l cot θ(cid:19) Fll(θ) = 0.

(77)

(78)

This equation can be immediately integrated if we notice the relationship

Its general solution is

cot θdθ =

d(sin θ)

sin θ

.

Fll = cl(sin θ)l,

(79)

(80)

where cl is a normalization constant.

It follows that for any positive or zero value of l, there is a function

Yll(θ, φ), which up to a constant factor is

Y ll(θ, φ) = cl(sin θ)leilφ.

(81)

Using repeatedly the action of l−, one can build the whole set of functions
Yll−1(θ, φ), . . . , Yl0(θ, φ), . . . , Yl−l(θ, φ). Next, we look at the way in which
these functions can be put into correspondence with the eigenvalue pair
l(l + 1)¯h, m¯h (where l is an arbitrary positive integer such that l ≤ m ≤ l
). Using (78), we can make the conclusion that any other eigenfunction
Ylm(θ, φ) can unumbigously be obtained from Yll.

Properties of spherical harmonics

α Iterative relationships
From the general results of this chapter, we have

l±Ylm(θ, φ) = ¯hql(l + 1) − m(m ± 1)Ylm±1(θ, φ).

(82)

58

Using (62) for l± and the fact that Ylm(θ, φ) is the product of a θ-dependent
function and e±iφ, one gets

e±iφ(cid:18) ∂

∂θ − m cot θ(cid:19) Ylm(θ, φ) =ql(l + 1) − m(m ± 1)Ylm±1(θ, φ)

(83)

β Orthonormalization and completeness relationships
Equation (68) determines the spherical harmonics only up to a constant
factor. We shall now choose this factor such that to have the orthonormal-
ization of Ylm(θ, φ) (as functions of the angular variables θ, φ)

Z 2π

0

dφZ π

0

sin θ dθY ∗lm(θ, φ)Ylm(θ, φ) = δl′lδm′m.

(84)

In addition, any continuous function of θ, φ can be expressed by means of
the spherical harmonics as follows

f (θ, φ) =

lXm=−l

clmYlm(θ, φ),

∞Xl=0
dφZ π

0

where

clm =Z 2π

0

sin θ dθ Y ∗lm(θ, φ)f (θ, φ).

(85)

(86)

The results (85), (86) are consequences of deﬁning the spherical harmon-
ics as an orthonormalized and complete base in the space εΩ of functions of
θ, φ. The completeness relationship is

∞Xl=0

lXm=l

Ylm(θ, φ)Y ∗lm(θ′, φ) = δ(cos θ − cos θ′)δ(φ, φ),

=

1

sin θ

δ(θ − θ′)δ(φ, φ).

(87)

The ‘function’ δ(cos θ − cos θ′) occurs because the integral over the variable
θ is performed by using the diﬀerential element sin θ dθ = −d(cos θ).
Parity operator P for spherical harmonics
The behavior of P in 3D is rather close to that in 1D. When it is applied to
a function of cartesian coordinates ψ(x, y, z) changes the sign of each of the
coordinates

Pψ(x, y, z) = ψ(−x,−y,−z).

(88)

59

P has the properties of a hermitic operator being also a unitary operator as
well as a projector since P 2 is an identity operator
hr|P|r′i = hr|−r′i = δ(r + −r′),
P 2|ri = P(P|ri) = P| − ri = |ri.

(89)

Therefore

P 2 = ˆ1,

(90)
for which the eigenvalues are P = ±1. The eigenfunctions are called even
if P = 1 and odd if P = −1. In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, the
operator ˆH for a conservative system is invariant with regard to discrete
unitary transformations, i.e.

(91)
Thus, ˆH commutes with P and the parity of the state is a constant of the
motion. In addition, P commutes with the operators ˆl

P ˆHP = P−1 ˆHP = ˆH.

[P, ˆli] = 0,

[P, ˆl±] = 0.

(92)
If ˆH is even and we consider an eigenfunction |Φni that has a well-deﬁned
parity (P|Φni), ‘noncolinear’ with |ψni, then because P commutes with ˆH
we infer that (P|Φni) is an eigenvector of ˆH with the same eigenvalue as
|Φni). If ψ is a common eigenfunction of the triplet P, ˆl ¸si ˆlz, it follows from
(92) that the paritities of the states which difer only in ˆlz coincide. In this
way, one can identify the parity of a particle of orbital angular momentum
ˆl.

In spherical coordinates, we shall consider the following change of vari-

ables

r → r,

θ → π − θ

φ → π + φ.

(93)

Thus, using a standard base in the space of wavefunctions of a particle
without ‘intrinsic rotation’, the radial part of the base functions ψklm(~r)
is not changed by the parity operator. Only the spherical harmonics will
change. The transformations (93) are from the trigonometric standpoint as
follows

sin(π−θ) → sin θ,
leading to the following transformation of the function Yll(θ, φ)

cos(π−θ) → − cos θ

eim(π+φ → (−1)meimφ (94)

Yll(φ − θ, π + φ) = (−1)lYll(θ, φ) .

(95)

60

From (95) it follows that the parity of Yll is (−1)l. On the other hand, l−
(as well as l+ is invariant to the transformations

∂
∂θ

,

∂

∂
∂φ

∂

ei(π+φ) → −eiφ

∂(π + φ) →

∂(π − θ) → −
cot(π−θ) → −cotθ .
(96)
In other words, l± are even. Therefore, we infer that the parity of any
spherical harmonics is (−1)l, that is it is invariant under azimuthal changes
(97)

Ylm(φ − θ, π + φ) = (−1)lYlm(θ, φ).

In conclusion, the spherical harmonics are functions of well-deﬁned parity,
which is independent of m, even if l is even and odd if l is odd.

The spin operator

Some particles have not only orbital angular momentum with regard to
external axes but also a proper momentum , which is known as spin denoted
here by ˆS. This operator is not related to normal rotation with respect to
‘real’ axes in space, although it fulﬁlls commutation relations of the sme
type as those of the orbital angular momentum, i.e.

[ ˆSi, ˆSj] = iεijk ˆSk ,

(98)

together with the following properties

(1). For the spin operator all the formulas of the orbital angular momentum

from (23) till (48) are satisﬁed.

(2). The spectrum of the spin projections is a sequence of either integer or

half-integer numbers diﬀering by unity.

(3). The eigenvalues of ˆS2 are the following

ˆS2ψs = S(S + 1)ψs.

(99)

(4). For a given S, the components Sz can take only 2S + 1 values, from

−S to +S.

(5). Besides the usual dependence on ~r and/or ~p, the eigenfunctions of the
particles with spin depend also on a discrete variable, (characteristic
for the spin) σ denoting the projection of the spin on the z axis.

61

(6). The wavefunctions ψ(~r, σ) of a particle with spin can be expanded in

eigenfunctions of given spin projection Sz, i.e.

ψ(~r, σ) =

SXσ=−S

ψσ(~r)χ(σ),

(100)

where ψσ(~r) is the orbital part and χ(σ) is the spinorial part.

(7). The spin functions (the spinors) χ(σi) are orhtogonal for any pair σi 6=
σk. The functions ψσ(~r)χ(σ) in the sum of (100) are the components
of a wavefunction of a particle with spin.

(8). The function ψσ(~r) is called the orbital part of the spinor, or shortly

orbital.

(9) The normalization of the spinors is done as follows

SXσ=−S ||ψσ(~r)|| = 1.

(101)

The commutation relations allow to determine the explicit form of the
spin operators (spin matrices) acting in the space of the eigenfunctions of
deﬁnite spin projections.

Many ‘elementary’ particles, such as the electron, the neutron, the pro-
ton, etc. have a spin of 1/2 (in units of ¯h) and therefore the projection
of their spin takes only two values, (Sz = ±1/2 (in ¯h units), respectively.
They belong to the fermion class because of their statistics when they form
many-body systems.

On the other hand, the matrices Sx, Sy, Sz in the space of ˆS2, ˆSz are

teristic eq.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of σx, σy and σz are

λ2 − 1 = 0.

λ = ±1.

(104)

(105)

The algebra of these matrices is the following

i = ˆI,

ψ1(r,− 1

(107)

are diﬀerent solutions because of the diﬀerent projections Sz. The value
of the probability of one or another projection is determined by the square
moduli ||ψ1||2 or ||ψ2||2, respectively, such that
||ψ1||2 + ||ψ2||2 = 1.

(109)

so that the eigenfunction of a particle of spin 1/2 can be written as a column
matrix

ψ2 ! .
ψ = ψ1χ1 + ψ2χ2 =  ψ1

(110)

In the following, the orbitals will be replaced by numbers because we are
interested only in the spin part.

Transformations of spinors to rotations

Let ψ be the wavefunction of a spin system in Σ. We want to determine
the probability of the spin projection in a arbitrary direction in 3D space,
which one can always chose as the z′ of Σ′. As we have already seen in the
case of the angular momentum there are two viewpoints in trying to solve
this problem

63

(α) ψ does not change when Σ → Σ′ and the operator ˆΛ transforms as
a vector. We have to ﬁnd the eigenfunctions of the projections S′z
and to expand ψ in these eigenfunctions. The square moduli of the
coeﬃcients give the result

ˆS′x = ˆSx cos φ + ˆSy sin φ = e−ilφ ˆSxeilφ,
ˆS′y = − ˆSx sin φ + ˆSy cos φ = e−ilφ ˆSyeilφ,

ˆS′z = − ˆSz = eilφ ˆSz,

(111)

for inﬁnitesimal rotations and from the commutation relations one can
ﬁnd

ˆL = ˆSz,
where ˆL is the inﬁnitesimal generator.

(112)

(β) The second reprezentation is:

ˆS does not change when Σ → Σ′ and the components of ψ does change.
The transformation to this reprezentation can be performed through
a unitary transformation of the form

ˆV † ˆS′ ˆV = ˆΛ,

ψ′2 ! = ˆV †  ψ1
  ψ′1

ψ2 ! .

Using (111) and (113) one gets

ˆV †e−i ˆSzφ ˆSei ˆSzφ ˆV = ˆS,

ˆV † = ei ˆSzφ,

and from (114) we are led to

  ψ′1
ψ′2 ! = ei ˆSzφ  ψ1

A result of Euler

One can reach any reference frame Σ′ of arbitrary orientation with regard
to Σ through only three rotations; the ﬁrst of angle φ around z, the next of
angle θ around x′ and the last of angle ψa around z′, i.e. This important
result belongs to Euler. The parameters (ϕ, θ, ψa) are called Euler’s angles.
Thus

ˆV †(ϕ, θ, ψa) = ˆV †z′(ψa) ˆV †x′(θ) ˆV †z (ϕ).

(117)

(118)

(119)

The matrices ˆV †z are of the form (116), whereas ˆV †x is of the form

so that

i sin θ

ˆV †x (ϕ) =  cos θ

(120)

From (120) one can infer that there is a one-to-one mapping between any
rotation in E3 and a linear transformation of E2, the two-dimensional Eu-
clidean space. This mapping is related to the two components of the spinorial
wavefunction. The rotation in E3 does not imply a rotation in E2, which
means that

hΦ′|ψ′i = hΦ|ψi = Φ∗1ψ1 + Φ∗2ψ2.

(121)

From (119) one ﬁnds that (121) does not hold; nevertheless there is an
invariance in the transformations (119) in the space E2 of spinorial wave-
functions

The linear transformations that preserve invariant bilinear forms invari-

{Φ|ψ} = ψ1Φ2 − ψ2Φ1.

(122)

ant are called binary transformations.

A physical quantity with two components for which a rotation of the
coordinate system is a binary transformation is know as a spin of ﬁrst order
or shortly spin.

The spinors of a system of two fermions

The eigenfunctions of iˆs2

iˆsz, with i = 1, 2 have the following form

i|+i =  1
0 !i

,

i|−i =  0
1 !i

.

A very used operator in a two-fermion system is the total spin

ˆS =1 ˆS +2 ˆS .

(123)

(124)

iˆs2

The spinors of ˆs2 ˆsz are kets | ˆS, σi, which are linear combinations of
iˆsz
| + +i =  1
| − +i =  0

| + −i =  1
| − −i =  0

(125)

,

,

,

.

The spinorial functions in (125) are assumed orthonormalized.

In En
the ket | + +i has Sz = 1 and at the same time it is an eigenfunction of the
operator
(126)

ˆS =1 ˆs2 + 2(1ˆs)(2ˆs) +2 ˆs2,

as one can see from

ˆS2 = | + +i = 3
ˆS2 = | + +i = 2| + +i = 1(1 + 1)| + +i.
If we introduce the operator

2| + +i + 2(1ˆsx ·2 ˆsx +1 ˆsy ·2 ˆsy +1 ˆsz ·2 ˆsz)| + +i,(127)
(128)

ˆS− =1 ˆs− +2 ˆs−,

(129)

one gets

[ ˆS−, ˆS2] = 0.

(130)
Then ( ˆS−)k|1, 1i can be written in terms of the eigenfunctions of the operator
ˆS2, i.e.
(131)

ˆS−|1, 1i = ˆS−| + +i = √2| + −i + √2| − +i.

66

Thus, Sz = 0 in the state ˆS−|1, 1i. On the other hand, from the normaliza-
tion condition, we have

|1, 0i = 1√2

(| + −i + | − +i)
ˆS−|1, 0i = | − −i + | − −i = α|1,−1i.

In addition, the normalization condition gives

|1,−1i = |−,−i.

(132)

(133)

(134)

There is only one other linear-independent combination of functions of

the type (125), which is diﬀerent of |1, 1i, |1, 0i and |1,−1i, which is

ψ4 = 1√2

(| + −i − | − +i),
ˆS2ψ4.

ˆSzψ4 = 0,

Therefore

ψ4 = |0, 0i.

(135)

(136)

(137)

ψ4 describes the state of a system of two fermions having the total spin equal
to zero. The latter type of state is called singlet. On the other hand, the
state of two fermions of total spin one can be called triplet having a degree
of degeneration g = 3.

Total angular momentum

The total angular momentum is an operator deﬁned as the sum of the an-
gular and spin momenta, i.e.

ˆJ = ˆl + ˆS,

(138)

where ˆl and ˆS, as we have seen, act in diﬀerent spaces, though the square
of ˆl and ˆS commute with ˆJ

[ ˆJi, ˆJj] = iεijk ˆJk,

[ ˆJi, ˆl2] = 0,

[ ˆJi, ˆS2] = 0,

(139)

From (139) one ﬁnds that ˆl2 and ˆS2 have a common eigenfunction system
with ˆJ 2 and ˆJz.

67

Let us determine the spectrum of the projections ˆJz for a fermion. The

state of maximum projection ˆJz can be written

¯ψ = ψll  1

ˆzψ = (l + 1

0 ! = |l, l, +i
2 ) ¯ψ,→ j = l + 1
2 .

We introduce the operator ˆJ− deﬁned as

ˆJ− = ˆl− + ˆS− = ˆl− +  0 0
1 0 ! .

(140)

(141)

(142)

On account of the normalization α =p(J + M )(J − M + 1), one gets

ˆJ−ψll  1

0 ! = √2l|l, l − 1, +i + |l, l − 1,−i,

so that the value of the projection of ˆj− in ˆj−

¯ψ will be

ˆz = (l − 1) + 1

2 = l − 1
2 .

It follows that ˆ− lowers by one unit the action of ˆJz.

In the general case we have

− = ˆlk
ˆk

− + kˆlk−1
−

ˆS− .

One can see that (145) is obtained from the binomial expansion considering
that ˆs2

−|l, l, +i =r k!(2l)!
Now noticing that m = l − k
− |l, l, +i =r (l−m)!(2l)!

(2l−k+1)! k|l, l − k + 1,−i .

(2l+m+1)! (l−m)|l, m+1,−i. (148)

68

The eigenvalues of the projections of the total angular momentum are given
by the sequence of numbers diﬀering by one unit from j = l + 1
2 pˆın˘a to
2 . All these states belong to the same eigenfunction of ˆJ as |l, l, +i
j = l − 1
because [ ˆJ−, ˆJ 2] = 0:

ˆJ 2|l, l, +i = (ˆl2 + 2ˆl ˆS + ˆS2)|l, l, +i,

= [l(l + 1) + 2l 1

2 + 3

4 ]|l, l, +i

(149)

where j(j + 1) = (l + 1

2 )(l + 3

2 ).

In the left hand side of (149) a contribution diﬀerent of zero gives only
j = ˆlz ˆSz. Thus, the obtained eigenfunctions correspond to the pair j = l+ 1
2 ,
mj = m + 1

N = (2l + 1)(2s + 1) = 4l + 2,

(151)

of which in (150) only (2j+1)=2l+3 have been built. The rest of 2l − 1
eigenfunctions can be obtained from the orthonormalization condition:

|l − 1

2 , m − 1

2i =q l−m

2l+1|l, m, +i −q l+m+1

2l+1 |l, m + 1,−i.

If two subsystems are in interaction in such a way that each of the
angular momenta ˆji is conserved, then the eigenfunctions of the total angular
momentum

(152)

(153)

ˆJ = ˆ1 + ˆ2,

can be obtained by a procedure similar to the previous one. For ﬁxed eigen-
values of ˆ1 and ˆ2 there are (2j1 +1)(2j2 +1) orthonormalized eigenfunctions
of the projection of the total angular momentum ˆJz; the one corresponding
to the maximum value of the projection ˆJz, i.e. MJ = j1 + j2, can be built
in a unique way and therefore J = j1 + j2 is the maximum value of the
total angular momentum of the system. Applying the operator ˆJ = ˆ1 + ˆ2
repeatingly to the function

|j1 + j2, j1 + j2, j1 + j2i = |j1, j1i · |j2, j2i,

(154)

one can obtain all the 2(j1 + j2) + 1 eigenfunctions of ˆJ = j1 + j2 with
diﬀerent M s:

−(j1 + j2) ≤ M ≤ (j1 + j2).

69

For example, the eigenfunction of M = j1 + j2 − 1 is
|j1+j2, j1+j2−1, j1, j2i =s j1
j1 + j2|j1, j1, j2, j2−1i.
(155)
Applying iteratively the operator ˆJ−, all the 2(j1 + j2 − 1)− 1 eigenfunc-
One can prove that

j1 + j2|j1, j1−1, j2, j2i+s j2

tions of J = j1 + j2 − 1 can be obtained.

|j1 − j2| ≤ J ≤ j1 + j2 ,

(2J + 1) = (2J1 + 1)(2J2 + 1) .

(156)

so that

Thus

max JXmin J

|J, M, j1, j2i = Xm1+m2=M

(j1m1j2m2|JM )|j1, m1, j2, m2i ,

(157)

where the coeﬃcients (j1m1j2m2|JM ) determine the contribution of the
various kets |j1, m1, j2, m2i to the eigenfunctions of ˆJ 2, ˆJz having the eigen-

values J(J + 1), M . They are called Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients.

In addition, [ˆlz, ˆAy] = i ˆAx can be obtained from

[ˆlz, ˆAx] = i ˆAy .

(1 + iˆlzdφ) ˆAy(1 − iˆlzdφ) = ˆAxdφ − ˆAy,

4. THE WKB METHOD

In order to study more realistic potentials with regard to rectangular
barriers and wells, it is necessary to employ approximate methods allowing
to solve the Schr¨odinger equation for more general classes of potentials and
at the same time to give very good approximations of the exact solutions.

The aim of the various approximative methods is to oﬀer solutions of
acceptable precision and simplicity that can be used for understanding the
behaviour of the system in quasianalytic terms.

Within quantum mechanics, one of the oldest and eﬃcient approximate
method for getting rather good Schr¨odinger solutions was developed almost
simulataneously by G. Wentzel, H. A. Kramers and L. Brillouin in 1926,
hence the acronym WKB under which this method is known (or JWKB as
is more correctly used by many authors, see note 4N).

It is worth mentioning that the WKB method applies to 1D Schr¨odinger
equations and that there are serious diﬃculties when trying to generalize it
to more dimensions.

In order to solve the Schr¨odinger equation

q0 = p(x) =qη − f (x)

A glance to eq. (24), aﬀords us to consider q1 as the slope, up to a change

therefore the series diverges. To avoid this the following WKB condition
is imposed

|q0| ≫ | − ξq1| = ξ|q1| .

78

It is worth noting that this WKB condition WKB is not fulﬁlled at those

points xk where

Since q0 = p =q 2m(E−u)

2mu0

q0(xk) = p(xk) = 0 .

the previous equation leads us to

E = u(xk) .

(26)

In classical mechanics the points xk that satisﬁes (26) are called turning
points because the change of the sense of the motion of a macroscopic
particle takes place there.

By means of these arguments, we can say that q0 is a classical solution of
the problem under examination; also that the quantities q1 & q2 are the ﬁrst
and the second quantum corrections, respectively, in the WKB problem.

To obtain the WKB wavefunctions we shall consider only the classical
solution and the ﬁrst quantum correction that we plug in the WKB form of
ψ

where A is a constant, whereas for the ﬁrst factor we get

exp  i

The latter are known as the WKB solutions of the 1D Schr¨odinger equation.
The general WKB solution in the region in which the WKB condition is
satisﬁed is written down as

ψ = a+ψ+ + a−ψ− .

(28)

As already mentioned there is no WKB solution at the turning points. This
raises the question of the manner in which one has to do the passing from
ψ(x < xk) to ψ(x > xk). The solution of this diﬃculty is achieved by
introducing the WKB connection formulas.

The connection formulas

We have already seen that the WKB solutions are singular at the clas-
sical turning points; however, these solutions are correct both on the left
and right side of these turning points xk. A natural question is how do we
change ψ(x < xk) in ψ(x > xk) when passing through the turning points.
The explicit answer is given by the connection formulas.

From the theory of diﬀerential equations of complex variable it can be
proved that really there are such connection formulas and that they are the
following

1

ψ1(x) =

→

[−r(x)]

[r(x)]

exp(cid:18)−Z xk
cos(cid:18)Z x
xkqr(x)dx −

π

4(cid:19) ,

(29)

where ψ1(x) has only an attenuated exponential behavior for x < xk. The
ﬁrst connection formula shows that the function ψ(x), which at the left of
the turning point behaves exponentially decaying, turns at the right of xk
into a cosinusoide of phase φ = π
4 and double amplitude with regard to the
amplitude of the exponential.

In the case of a more general function ψ(x), such as a function with both

rising and decaying exponential behavior, the connection formula is

sin(cid:18)φ +
←

π

4(cid:19)

1

x q−r(x)dx(cid:19) ←

exp(cid:18)Z xk

4

[−r(x)]
cos(cid:18)Z x

4

[r(x)]

(30)

80

under the condition that φ s˘a do not take a value that is too close to − π
4 .
The reason is that if φ = − π
4 , then the sinus function is zero . The latter
connection formula means that a function whose behavior is of the cosinusoid
type at the right of a turning point changes into a growing exponential with
sinusoid-modulated amplitude at the right of that point.

In order to study the details of the procedure of getting the connection
formulas we recommend the book Mathematical Methods of Physics by J.
Mathews & R.L. Walker.

Estimation of the WKB error

We have found the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation in the regions
where the WKB condition is satisﬁed. However, the WKB solutions are
divergent at the turning points. We thus brieﬂy analyze the error introduced
by using the WKB approximation and tackling the connection formulas in
a close neighbourhood of the turning points.

Considering x = xk as a turning point, we have q0(xk) = p(xk) = 0 ⇒
E = u(xk). At the left of xk, that is on the ‘half-line’ x < xk, we shall
assume E < u(x) leading to the WKB solution

Similarly, at the right of xk (on the ‘half-line x > xk) we assume E > u(x);
therefore the WKB solution in the latter region will be

ψ(x) =

If ψ(x) is a real function, it will have this property both at the right and
the left of xk. It is usually called the “reality condition”. It means that if
a, b ∈ ℜ, then c = d∗.
Our problem consists in connecting the approximations on the two sides
of xk such that they refer to the same solution. This means to ﬁnd c and d if
one knows a and b, as well as viceversa. To achieve this connection, we have
to use an approximate solution, which should be correct along a contour
connecting the regions on the two sides of xk, where the WKB solutions are
also correct. A method proposed by Zwann and Kemble is very useful in
this case. It consists in going out from the real axis in the neighbourhood
of xk on a contour around xk in the complex plane. It is assumed that on
this contour the WKB solutions are still correct. Here, we shall use this
method as a means of getting the estimation of the error produced by the
WKB method.

The estimation of the error is always an important matter for any ap-
proximate solutions. In the case of the WKB procedure, it is more signiﬁcant
because it is an approximation on large intervals of the real axis that can
lead to the accuulation of the errors as well as to some artefacts due to the
phase shifts that can be introduced in this way.

Let us deﬁne the associated WKB functions as follows

order to avoid the discontinuities in the zeros of r(x) = E−u(x)

with respect to x, leading to

(36)

although they satisfy only approximately the Schr¨odinger equation, which
is a regular equation in x = xk, whereas the same equation for the associate
WKB functions is singular at that point.

We shall now deﬁne the functions α±(x) satisfying the following two

relationships

ψ(x) = α+(x)W+(x) + α−(x)W−(x)
ψ′(x) = α+(x)W ′+(x) + α−(x)W ′
−(x) ,

(37)

(38)

where ψ(x) is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation. Solving the previous
equations for α±, we get

α+ =

ψW ′− − ψ′W−
W+W ′− − W ′+W−

α− = −

ψW ′+ − ψ′W+
W+W ′− − W ′+W−

,

where the numerator is just the Wronskian of W+ and W−. It is not diﬃcult
to prove that this takes the value − 2
ξ i, so that α± simpliﬁes to the following
form
i(cid:0)ψW ′
− − ψ′W−(cid:1)
i(cid:0)ψW ′+ − ψ′W+(cid:1) .

Eqs. (42) and (43) are useful for estimating the WKB error in the 1D

case.

The reason for which dα±

dx can be considered as a measure of the WKB er-
rors is that in the eqs. (31) and (32) the constants a, b and c, d, respectively,
give only approximate solutions ψ, while the functions α± when introduced
in the eqs. (37) and (38) produce exact ψ solutions. From the geometrical
viewpoint the derivative gives the slope of the tangent to these functions
and indicates the measure in which α± deviates from the constants a, b, c
and d.

where B is another arbitrary constant. The reason why the connection
formula is again given by eq. (29) is easily understood examinining what
happens when the particle reaches the second classical turning point at x =
b. This produces the inversion of the direction of motion. Thus, the particle
appears to come from the right toward the left. In other words, we are in
the ﬁrst case (from the left to the right), only that as seen in a mirror placed
at the point x = a.

This result is very similar to the Bohr - Sommerfeld quantization rules.

We recall that Bohr’s postulate says that the orbital angular momen-
tum of an electron moving on an “allowed atomic orbit” is quantized as
L = n¯h, n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. We also recall that the Wilson - Sommerfeld quan-
tization rules assert that any coordinate of a system that varies periodically

in time should satisfy the ‘quantum’ condition: H pqdq = nqh, where q is a

periodic coordinate, pq is the associated momentum, nq is an integer, and h
is Planck’s constant. One can see that the WKB result is indeed very similar.

Problem 4.2

Estimate the error of the WKB solution WKB at a point x1 6= xk, where
xk is a classical turning point for the diﬀerential equation y′′ + xy = 0. The
solution of this problem is of importance in the study of uniform ﬁelds, such
as the gravitational and electric ﬁelds generated by large planes.

Solution:

For this diﬀerential equation we have

ξ = 1,

r(x) = x

r(x) = x has a single zero at xk = 0, therefore for x ≫ 0:

diﬀerential equation is satisﬁed

x−2)W± = 0 .

(51)

The exact solution y(x) of the latter diﬀerential equation can be written
as a linear combination of W±, as it has been shown in the corresponding

87

section where the WKB error has been tackled; recall that the following
form of the linear combination was proposed therein

y(x) = α+(x)W+(x) + α−(x)W−(x)

For large x, the general solution of the diﬀerential equation can be writ-

ten in the WKB approximation as follows

error due to these WKB solutions. A simple measure of this error is the
deviation of α+ and of α− relative to the constants A. Using the equation

and doiing the corresponding substitutions, one gets

5. THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR (HO)

The solution of the Schr¨odinger eq. for HO

The HO can be considered as a paradigm of Physics. Its utility is manifest
in many areas from classical physics until quantum electrodynamics and
theories of gravitational collapse.
From classical mechanics we know that many complicated potentials can be
well approximated near their equilibrium positions by HO potentials

V (x) ∼

V ′′(a)(x − a)2 .

This is a 1D case. For this case, the classical Hamiltonian function of a

particle of mass m, oscillating at the frequency ω has the following form:

H =

Since we consider a time-independent potential, the eigenfunctions Ψn
and the eigenvalues En are obtained by means of the time-independent

For the HO Hamiltonian, the Schr¨odinger eq. is

the Schr¨odinger eq. becomes

d2Ψ
dx2 + [k2 − λ2x2]Ψ = 0 ,

which is known as Weber’s diﬀerential equation in mathematics.
We shall make now the transformation

y = λx2 .

take the form

(17)

(18)

Taking A = 0, we eliminate exp y

2 since it diverges in the limit y → ∞,
keeping only the attenuated exponential. We can now suggest that Ψ has
the following form

Ψ(y) = exp −y
2

ψ(y) .

Plugging it in the diﬀerential equation for y ( eq. 15) one gets:

The latter is a conﬂuent hypergeometric equation 4 :

The general solution of this equation is

y(z) = A 1F1(a; c, z) + B z1−c

1F1(a − c + 1; 2 − c, z) ,

(22)

where the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation is deﬁned by

1F1(a; c, z) =

(a)nxn

.

∞Xn=0

(23)

Comparing now our equation with the standard conﬂuent hypergeomet-

The latter approximation leads to a divergence in the normalization in-
tegral, which physically is not acceptable. What one does in this case is to
impose the termination condition for the series 6 , that is , the series has
only a ﬁnite number of terms and therefore it is a polynomial of n order.
We thus notice that asking for a ﬁnite normalization constant (as already
known, a necessary condition for the physical interpretation in terms of prob-
abilities), leads us to the truncation of the series, which simultaneously gen-
erates the quantization of energy.

The HO energy spectrum is equidistant, i.e., there is the same energy
diﬀerence ¯hω ˆıbetween any consequitive neighbour levels. Another remark
refers to the minimum value of the energy of the oscillator; somewhat sur-
prisingly it is not zero. This is considered by many people to be a pure
quantum result because it is zero when ¯h → 0. It is known as the zero point
energy and the fact that it is diﬀerent of zero is the main characteristic of
all conﬁning potentials.

Creation and anihilation operators: ˆa† and ˆa

There is another approach to deal with the HO besides the conventional one
of solving the Schr¨odinger equation. It is the algebraic method, also known
as the method of creation and annihilation (ladder) operators. This is a very
eﬃcient procedure, which can be successfully applied to many quantum-
mechanical problems, especially when dealing with discrete spectra.
Let us deﬁne two nonhermitic operators a and a† :

a =r mω

2¯h

(x +

ip
mω

)

93

(39)

a† =r mω

2¯h

ip
mω

) .

(x −
annihilation operator

(40)

These operators are known as

creation
operator,
respectively (the reason of this terminology will be seen in the
following, though one can claim that it comes from quantum ﬁeld theories).
Let us calculate the commutator of these operators

and

[a, a†] =

mω
2¯h

[x +

ip
mω

, x −

ip
mω

] =

1
2¯h

(−i[x, p] + i[p, x]) = 1 ,

(41)

where we have used the commutator

[x, p] = i¯h .

(42)

Therefore the annihilation and creation operators do not commute, since

we have

[a, a†] = 1 .

Let us also introduce the very important number operator ˆN :

ˆN = a†a .

(43)

(44)

This operator is hermitic as one can readily prove using (AB)† = B†A†

:

ˆN† = (a†a)† = a†(a†)† = a†a = ˆN .

Considering now that

a†a =

2¯h

(x2 +

p2
m2ω2 ) +

i
2¯h

[x, p] =

ˆH
¯hω −

1
2

(45)

(46)

we notice that the Hamiltonian can be written in a quite simple form as a
function of the number operator

ˆH = ¯hω( ˆN +

1
2

) .

(47)

The number operator bear this name because its eigenvalues are precisely

the subindices of the eigenfunctions on which it acts

where we have used the notation

ˆN | ni = n | ni ,

P sin = | ni .

94

(48)

(49)

Applying this fact to (47), we get

ˆH | n >= ¯hω(n +

1
2

) | n > .

(50)

On the other hand, from the Schr¨odinger equation we know that ˆH |
n >= E | n >. In this way, it comes out that the energy eigenvalues are
given by

En = ¯hω(n +

) .

(51)

1
2

This result is identical (as it should be) to the result (36).

We go ahead and show why the operators a and a† bear the names they
have. For this, we calculate the commutators

[ ˆN , a] = [a†a, a] = a†[a, a] + [a†, a]a = −a ,

(52)

which can be obtained from [a, a] = 0 and (43). Similarly, let us calculate

[ ˆN , a†] = [a†a, a†] = a†[a, a†] + [a†, a†]a = a† .

(53)

Using these two commutators, we can write

ˆN(a† | n >) = ([ ˆN , a†] + a† ˆN ) | n >

= (a† + a† ˆN ) | n >
= a†(1 + n) | n >= (n + 1)a† | n > .

(54)

By a similar procedure, one can also obtain

ˆN (a | n >) = ([ ˆN , a] + a ˆN ) | n >= (n − 1)a | n > .

(55)

The expression (54) implies that one can consider the ket a† | n > as an
eigenket of that number operator for which the eigenvalue is raised by one
unit. In physical terms, this means that an energy quanta has been produced
by the action of a† on the ket. This already expains the name of creation
operator. Similar comments with corresponding conclusion can be infered
for the operator a, originating the name of annihilation operator (an energy
quanta is eliminated from the system when this operator is put in action).
(54) implies the proportionality of the kets a† | n > and
Moreover, eq.
| n + 1 >:
(56)

a† | n >= c | n + 1 > ,

95

where c is a constant that should be determined. Considering in addition

(a† | n >)† =< n | a = c∗ < n + 1 |

,

one can perform the following calculation

< n | a(a† | n >) = c∗ < n + 1 | (c | n + 1 >)

< n | aa† | n >= c∗c < n + 1 | n + 1 >

< n | aa† | n >=| c |2 .

But from the commutation relation for the operators a and a†

[a, a†] = aa† − a†a = aa† − ˆN = 1 ,

we have

aa† = ˆN + 1 .

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

(61)

(62)

Substituting in (60), we get
< n | ˆN + 1 | n >=< n | n > + < n | ˆN | n >= n + 1 =| c |2 .
Asking conventionally for a positive and real c, the following value is

(63)

obtained

c = √n + 1 .

Consequently, we have

a† | n >= √n + 1 | n + 1 > .

(64)

(65)

For the annihilation operator, following the same procedure one can get

the following relation

a | n >= √n | n − 1 > .

(66)

Let us show now that the values of n should be nonnegative integers.
For this, we employ the positivity requirement for the norm, applying it
to the state vector a | n >. The latter condition tells us that the interior
product of the vector with its adjunct ((a | n >)† =< n | a†) should always
be nonnegative
(67)

(< n | a†) · (a | n >) ≥ 0 .

This relationship is nothing else but

< n | a†a | n >=< n | ˆN | n >= n ≥ 0 .

(68)

96

Thus, n cannot be negativ. It should be an integer since were it not by
applying iteratively the annihilation operator we would be lead to negative
values of n, which would be a contradiction to the previous statement.
It is possible to express the state n (| ni) directly as a function of the
ground state (| 0i) using the creation operator. Let us see how proceeds this
important iteration

| 2i = [

| 3i = [

...

| ni = [

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

One can also apply this method to get the eigenfunctions in the conﬁg-

uration space. To achieve this, we start with the ground state

In the x representation, we have

a | 0i = 0 .

ˆaΨ0(x) =r mω

2¯h

(x +

)Ψ0(x) = 0 .

(73)

(74)

Recalling the form of the momentum operator in the x representation, we
can obtain a diﬀerential equation for the wavefunction of the ground state.

Moreover, introducing the deﬁnition x0 =q ¯h

mω , we have

(x + x2

)Ψ0 = 0 .

(75)

The latter equation can be readily solved, and normalizing (its integral from
−∞ to ∞ should be equal to unity), we obtain the wavefunction of the
ground state

Time evolution of the oscillator

In this section we shall illustrate on the HO example the way of working with
the Heisenberg representation in which the states are ﬁxed in time and only
the operators evolve. Thus, we shall consider the operators as functions
of time and obtain explicitly the time evolution of the HO position and
momentum operators, a and a†, respectively. The Heisenberg equations of
the motion for p and x are

following

(82)

(83)

These are a pair of coupled equations, which are equivalent to a pair of
uncoupled equations for the creation and annihilation operators. Explicitly,
we have

da

2¯h

(

ˆp
m − iω ˆx) = −iωa .

(86)

Similarly, one can obtain a diﬀerential equation for the creation operator

da†
dt

= iωa† .

(87)

The diﬀerential evolution equations for the creation and annihilation opera-
tors can be immediately integrated leading to the explicit evolution of these
operators as follows

a(t) = a(0)e−iωt
a†(t) = a†(0)eiωt .

(88)

(89)

It is worth noting based on these results and eqs. (44) and (47) that

both the Hamiltonian and the number operator are not time dependent.
Using the latter two results, we can obtain the position and momentum
operators as functions of time as far as they are expressed in terms of the
creation and annihilation operators

(a + a†)

ˆx = s ¯h
ˆp = is m¯hω

2mω

(a† − a) .

Substituting them, one gets

ˆx(t) = ˆx(0) cos ωt +

ˆp(0)
mω

sin ωt

ˆp(t) = −mω ˆx(0) sin ωt + ˆp(0) cos ωt .

(90)

(91)

(92)

(93)

The time evolution of these operators is the same as for the classical

equations of the motion.
Thus, we have shown here the explicit evolution form of the four HO ba-
sic operators, and also we illustrated the eﬀective way of working in the
Heisenberg representation.

The 3D HO

We commented on the importance in physics of the HO at the very beginning
of our analysis of the quantum HO. If we will consider a 3D analog, we would
be led to study a Taylor expansion in three variables7 retaining the terms
up to the second order, we get a quadratic form in the most general case.
The problem at hand in this approximation is not as simple as it might look
from the examination of the corresponding potential

V (x, y, z) = ax2 + by2 + cz2 + dxy + exz + f yz .

(94)

There are however many systems with spherical symmetry or for which

this symmetry is suﬃciently exact. ˆIn acest caz:

V (x, y, z) = K(x2 + y2 + z2) ,

(95)

which is equivalent to saying that the second unmixed partial derivatives
have all the same value, denoted by K in our case). We can add that this is
a good approximation in the case in which the values of the mixed second
partial derivatves are small in comparison to the unmixed ones.
When these conditions are satisﬁed and the potential is given by (95), we
say that the system is a 3D spherically symmetric HO.
The Hamiltonian in this case is of the form

ˆH = −¯h2

2m ▽2 +

mω2

2

r2 ,

(96)

where the Laplace operator is given in spherical coordinates and r is the
spherical radial coordinate.
Since the potential is time independent the energy is conserved. In addition,
because of the spherical symmetry the orbital momentum is also conserved.
having two conserved quantities, we may say that to each of it one can
associate a quantum number. Thus, we can assume that the eigenfunctions
depend on two quantum numbers (even though for this case we shall see
that another one will occur). Taking care of these comments, the equation
of interest is

7It is possible to express the Taylor series in the neighbourhood of r0 as an exponential

The eigenfunctions of ˆL2 are the spherical harmonics, i.e.

ˆL2Ylml(θ, ϕ) = −¯h2l(l + 1)Ylml(θ, ϕ)

(97)

(98)

(99)

(100)

The fact that the spherical harmonics ‘wear’ the quantum number ml

introduces it in the total wavefunction Ψnlml.
In order to achieve the separation of the variables and functions, the follow-
ing substitution is proposed

Ψnlml(r, θ, ϕ) =

Rnl(r)

r

Ylml(θ, ϕ) .

(101)

Once this is plugged in the Schr¨odinger equation, the spatial part is
separated from the angular one; the latter is identiﬁed with an operator
that is proportional to the square of the orbital momentum, for which the
eigenfunctions are the spherical harmonics, whereas for the spatial part the
following equation is obtained

R′′nl + (

2mEnl

¯h2 −

m2ω2
¯h2 r2 −

l(l + 1)

r2

)Rnl(r) = 0 .

(102)

Using the deﬁnitions (7) and (8), the previous equation is precisely of the
form (9), unless the angular momentum term, which is commonly known as
the unghiular, care ˆın mod comun se cunoa¸ste ca angular momentum barrier

R′′nl + (k2 − λ2r2 −

l(l + 1)

r2

)Rnl = 0 .

(103)

To solve this equation, we shall start with its asymptotic analysis.
If we
shall consider ﬁrst r → ∞, we notice that the orbital momentum term is
negligible, so that in this limit the asymptotic behavior is similar to that of
(9), leading to

101

Rnl(r) ∼ exp −λr2

2

for

lim r → ∞ .

(104)

If now we pass to the behavior close to zero, we can see that the dominant
term is that of the orbital momentum, i.e., the diﬀerential equation (102) in
this limit turns into

R′′nl −

l(l + 1)

r2 Rnl = 0 .

(105)

This is a diﬀerential equation of the Euler type 8 , whose two independent

solutions are

Rnl(r) ∼ rl+1 or

lim r → 0 .
The previous arguments lead to proposing the substitution

r−l

for

Rnl(r) = rl+1 exp −λr2
2

φ(r) .

One can also use another substitution

Rnl(r) = r−l exp −λr2
2

v(r) ,

(106)

(107)

(108)

which, however, produces the same solutions as (107) (showing this is a help-
ful exercise). Substituing (107) in (103), the following diﬀerential equation
for φ is obtained

φ′′ + 2(

l + 1
r − λr)φ′ − [λ(2l + 3) − k2]φ = 0 .

(109)

Using now the change of variable w = λr2, one gets

Its solutions are of the type xα that are plugged in the equation obtaining a polynomial

in α.

where κ = k2

The quantum HO Hamiltonian reads

mω2ˆx2 .

In the momentum space, the operators ˆx and ˆp have the following form

We have to solve the eigenvalue problem (i.e., to get the eigenfunctions and
the eigenvalues) given by (5), which, with the previous Hamiltonian, turns
into the following diﬀerential equation

d2Ψ(p)
dp2 + (

2E
m¯h2ω2 −

p2

m2¯h2ω2

)Ψ(p) = 0 .

(116)

One can see that this equation is identical, up to some constants, with the
diﬀerential equation in the space of conﬁgurations (eq. (6) ). Just to show
another way of solving it, we deﬁne two parameters, which are analogous to
those in (7) and (8)

k2 =

2E

m¯h2ω2

λ =

1

m¯hω

.

(117)

With these deﬁnitions, we get the diﬀerential eq.
(9) and therefore the
solution sought for (after performing the asymptotic analysis) is of the form

Ψ(y) = e− 1

2 yφ(y) ,

(118)

where y = λp2 and λ is deﬁned in (117). Substitute (118) in (116) taking
care to put (118) in the variable p. One gets a diﬀerential equation in the
variable φ

d2φ(p)
dp2 − 2λp

the eigenvalues are given by

En = ¯hω(n +

This representation of Hermite polynomials is not really usual, though
it can prove useful in many cases. In order to accomplish the proof, we shall

The ﬁrst thing we shall do is to expand the binomial in the integral by using
the well-known binomial theorem

which is identical to (122), hence completing the proof.

Problem 5.3

Show that Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation is satisﬁed by doing
the calculation using the HO eigenfunctions .

We have to show that for any Ψn, we have

< (∆p)2(∆x)2 > ≥
where the notation <> means the mean value.
We shall separately calculate < (∆p)2 > and < (∆x)2 >, where each of
these expressions is

< (∆x)2 >=< (x− < x >)2 >=< x2−2x < x > + < x >2>=< x2 > − < x >2 .

First of all, we shall prove that both the mean of x as well as of p are

zero. For the mean of x, we have

< x >=Z ∞

−∞

x[Ψn(x)]2dx .

This integral is zero because the integrand is odd. Thus

< x >= 0 .

(129)

The same argument holds for the mean of p, if we do the calculation in
the momentum space, employing the functions obtained in problem 1. It is
suﬃcient to notice that the functional form is the same (only the symbol
does change). Thus

< p >= 0 .

(130)

Let us now calculate the mean of x2. We shall use the virial theorem 9.

We ﬁrst notice that

< V >=

1
2

mω2 < x2 > .

Therefore, it is possible to relate the mean of x2 directly to the mean of the
potential for this case (implying the usage of the virial theorem).

< x2 >=

2
mω2 < V > .

(131)

We also need the total energy

< H >=< T > + < V > ,

9We recall that the virial theorem in quantum mechanics asserts that

For a potential of the form V = λxn, the virial theorem gives

2 < T >=< r · ▽V (r) > .

where T is the kinetic energy and V is the potential energy.

2 < T >= n < V > ,

107

for which again one can make use of the virial theorem (for n = 2)

< H >= 2 < V > .

Thus, we obtain

< x2 >=

(135)

Employing (133) and (135), we have

(136)

Based on this result, we come to the conclusion that in the HO stationary
states that actually have not been directly used, Heisenberg’s uncertainty
relation is satisﬁed and it is at the minimum for the ground state, n = 0.

Problem 5.4

Obtain the matrix elements of the operators a, a†, ˆx, and ˆp.

Let us ﬁrst ﬁnd the matrix elements for the creation and annihilation

operators, which are very helpful for all the other operators.
We shall use the relatinships (65) and (66), leading to

< m | a | n >= √n < m | n − 1 >= √nδm,n−1 .

Similarly for the creation operator we have the result

< m | a† | n >= √n + 1 < m | n + 1 >= √n + 1δm,n+1 .

(137)

(138)

Let us proceed now with the calculation of the matrix elements of the
position operator. For this, let us express this operator in terms of creation

108

and annihilation operators. Using the deﬁnitions (39) and (40), one can
immediately prove that the position operator is given by

ˆx =s ¯h

2mω

(a + a†) .

(139)

Employing this result, the matrix elements of the operator ˆx can be

readily calculated

< m | ˆx | n > = < m |s ¯h

2mω

(a + a†) | n >

= s ¯h

2mω

[√nδm,n−1 + √n + 1δm,n+1] .

(140)

Following the same procedure we can calculate the matrix elements of the
momentum operator, just by taking into account that ˆp is given in terms of
the creation and annihilation operators as follows

ˆp = is m¯hω

2

(a† − a) .

This leads us to

< m | ˆp | n >= is m¯hω

2

[√n + 1δm,n+1 − √nδm,n−1] .

(141)

(142)

One can realize the ease of the calculations when the matrix elements of
the creation and annihilation operators are used. Finally, we remark on the
nondiagonality of the obtained matrix elements. This is not so much of a
surprise because the employed representation is that of the number operator
and none of the four operators do not commute with it.

Problem 5.5

Find the mean values of ˆx2 and ˆp2 for the1D HO and use them to
calculate the mean (expectation) values of the kinetic and poten-
tial energies. Compare the result with the virial theorem.

First of all, let us obtain the mean value of ˆx2. For this, we use eq. (139)

that leads us to

ˆx2 =

¯h

2mω

(a2 + (a†)2 + a†a + aa†) .

(143)

109

Recall that the creation and annihilation operators do not commute. Based
on (143), we can calculate the mean value of ˆx2

< ˆx2 > = < n | ˆx2 | n >

=

¯h

2mω

[qn(n − 1)δn,n−2 +q(n + 1)(n + 2)δn,n+2

(144)

which shows that

< ˆx2 >=< n | ˆx2 | n >=

¯h

2mω

(2n + 1) .

(145)

In order to calculate the mean value of ˆp2 we use (141) that helps us to
express this operator in terms of the creation and annihilation operators

ˆp2 = −

m¯hω

2

(a2 + (a†)2 − aa† − a†a) .

(146)

This leads us to

< ˆp2 >=< n | ˆp2 | n >=

m¯hω

2

(2n + 1) .

(147)

The latter result practically gives us the mean kinetic energy

< ˆT >=<

ˆp2

We can see that these mean values are equal for any n, which conﬁrms
the quantum virial theorem, telling us that for a quadratic (HO) potential,
the mean values of the kinetic and potential energies should be equal and
therefore be half of the mean value of the total energy.

6. THE HYDROGEN ATOM

Introduction

In this chapter we shall study the hydrogen atom by soving the time-
independent Schr¨odinger equation for the potential due to two charged par-
ticles such as the electron and the proton, and the Laplace operator in
spherical coordinates. From the mathematical viewpoint, the method of
separation of variables will be employed, and a physical interpretation of
the wavefunction as solution of the Schr¨odinger equation in this important
case will be provided, together with the interpretation of the quantum num-
bers and of the probability densities.
The very small spatial scale of the hydrogen atom is a clue that the related
physical phenomena enter the domain of applicability of the quantum me-
chanics, for which the atomic processes have been a successful area since
the early days of the quantum approaches. Quantum mechanics, as any
other theoretical framework, gives relationships between observable quan-
tities. Since the uncertainty principle leads to a substantial change in the
understanding of observables at the conceptual level, it is important to have
a clear idea on the notion of atomic observable. As a matter of fact, the
real quantities on which quantum mechanics oﬀers explicit answers and con-
nections are always probabilites. Instead of saying, for example, that the
radius of the electron orbit in the fundamental state of the hydrogen atom is
always 5.3 × 10−11 m, quantum mechanics asserts that this is a truly mean
radius (not in the measurable sense). Thus, if one performs an appropriate
experiment, one gets, precisely as in the case of the common arrangement
of macroscopic detectors probing macroscopic properties of the matter, ran-
dom values around the mean value 5.3 × 10−11 m. In other words, from the
viewpoint of the experimental errors there is no essential diﬀerence with re-
gard to the classical physics. The fundamental diﬀerence is in the procedure
of calculating the mean values within the theoretical framework.

As is known, for performing quantum-mechanical calculations, one needs
a corresponding wave function Ψ. Although Ψ has no direct physical inter-
pretation, the square modulus | Ψ |2 calculated at an arbitrary position and
given moment is proportional to the probability to ﬁnd the particle in the
inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of that point at the given time. The purpose of
quantum mechanics is to determine Ψ for a speciﬁed particle in the prepared
experimental conditions.

Before proceeding with the rigorous approaches of getting Ψ for the
hydrogen electron, we will argue on several general requirements regarding
the wave function. First, the integral of | Ψ |2 over all space should be ﬁnite
if we really want to deal with a localizable electron. In addition, if

Z ∞
−∞ | Ψ |2 dV = 0 ,

(1)

| Ψ |2 cannot be negative or complex
then the particle does not exist.
because of simple mathematical reasons.
In general, it is convenient to
identify | Ψ |2 with the probability P not just the proportionality. In order
that | Ψ |2 be equal to P one imposes

because

is the mathematical way of saying that the particle exists at a point in
space at any given moment. A wave function respecting eq. 2 is said to be
normalized. Besides this, Ψ should be single valued, because P has a unique
value at a given point and given time. Another condition is that Ψ and its
partial ﬁrst derivatives ∂Ψ
∂z should be continuous at any arbitrary
point.

∂x , ∂Ψ

∂y , ∂Ψ

The Schr¨odinger equation is considered as the fundamental equation of
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in the same sense in which Newton’s
force law is the fundamental equation of motion of newtonian mechanics.
Notice however that we have now a wave equation for a function Ψ which is
not directly measurable.

Once the potential energy is given, one can solve the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion for Ψ, implying the knowledge of the probability density | Ψ |2 as a
function of x, y, z, t. In many cases of interest, the potential energy does not
depend on time. Then, the Schr¨odinger equation simpliﬁes considerably.
Notice, for example, that for a 1D free particle the wave function can be
written

Ψ(x, t) = Ae(−i/¯h)(Et−px)

= Ae−(iE/¯h)te(ip/¯h)x
= ψ(x)e−(iE/¯h)t ,

112

(4)

i.e., Ψ(x, t) is the product of a time-dependent phase e−(iE/¯h)t and a sta-
tionary wave function ψ(x).

In the general case, the stationary Schr¨odinger equation can be solved,
under the aforementioned requirements, only for certain values of the energy
E. This is not a mathematical diﬃculty, but merely a fundamental physi-
cal feature. To solve the Schr¨odinger equation for a given system means
to get the wave function ψ, as a solution for which certain physical bound-
ary condition hold and, in addition, as already mentioned, it is continuous
together with its ﬁrst derivative everywhere in space, is ﬁnite, and single
valued. Thus, the quantization of energy occurs as a natural theoretical
element in wave mechanics, whereas in practice as a universal phenomenon,
characteristic for all stable microscopic systems.

Schr¨odinger equation for the hydrogen atom

In this section, we shall apply the Schr¨odinger equation to the hydrogen
atom, about which one knows that it is formed of a positive nucleus/proton
of charge +e and an electron of charge -e. The latter, being 1836 times
smaller in mass than the proton, is by far more dynamic.

If the interaction between two particles is of the type u(r) = u(| ~r1−~r2 |),
the problem of the motion is reduced both classically and quantum to the

Thus, one can obtain the hamiltonian operator for the corresponding

There are two possibilities. The ﬁrst is to express u as a function of the

cartesian coordinates x, y, z, substituing r by px2 + y2 + z2. The second

is to write the Schr¨odinger equation in spherical polar coordinates r, θ, φ.
Because of the obvious spherical symmetry of this case, we shall deal with the
latter approach, which leads to considerable mathematical simpliﬁcations.

(20)
This equation is a partial diﬀerential equation for the electron wavefunction
ψ(r, θ, φ) ‘within’ the atomic hydrogen. Together with the various conditions
that the wavefunction ψ(r, θ, φ) should fulﬁll [for example, ψ(r, θ, φ) should
have a unique value at any spatial point (r, θ, φ)], this equation speciﬁes
in a complete manner the behavior of the hydrogen electron. To see the
explicit behavior, we shall solve eq. 20 for ψ(r, θ, φ) and we shall interpret
appropriately the obtained results.

Separation of variables in spherical coordinates

The real usefulness of writing the hydrogen Schr¨odinger equation in spherical
coordinates consists in the easy way of achieving the separation procedure
in three independent equations, each of them being one-dimensional. The
separation procedure is to seek the solutions for which the wavefunction
ψ(r, θ, φ) has the form of a product of three functions, each in one of the
three spherical variables, namely R(r), depending only on r; Θ(θ) depending
only on θ, and Φ(φ) that depends only onφ. This is quite similar to the
separation of the Laplace equation. Thus

ψ(r, θ, φ) = R(r)Θ(θ)Φ(φ) .

(21)

The R(r) function describes the diﬀerential variation of the electron wave-
function ψ along the vector radius coming out from the nucleus, with θ and
φ assumed to be constant. The diﬀerential variation of ψ with the polar
angle θ along a meridian of an arbitrary sphere centered in the nucleus is
described only by the function Θ(θ) for constant r and φ. Finally, the func-
tion Φ(φ) describes how varies ψ with the azimuthal angle φ along a parallel
of an arbitrary sphere centered at the nucleus, under the conditions that r
and θ are kept constant.

Each of these equations is an ordinary diﬀerential equation for a function
of a single variable. In this way, the Schr¨odinger equation for the hydrogen
electron that initially was a partial diﬀerential equation for a function ψ of
three variables got a simple form of three 1D ordinary diﬀerential equations
for unknown functions of one variable.

Interpreting the separation constants: the quantum
numbers

The solution for the azimuthal part

Eq. 31 is readily solved leading to the following solution

Φ(φ) = Aφeimlφ ,

(34)

where Aφ is the integration constant. One of the conditions that a wave-
functions should fulﬁll and therefore also Φ, being a component of the full
wavefunction ψ) is to have a unique value for any point in space. For
example, one should notice that φ and φ + 2π are identical in the same
meridional plane. Therefore, one should have Φ(φ) = Φ(φ + 2π),
i.e.,
Aeimlφ = Aeiml(φ+2π). This can be fulﬁlled only if ml is zero or a positiv

117

or negative integer (±1,±2,±3, ...). ml is known as the magnetic quantum
number of the atomic electron and is related to the direction of the projec-
tion of the orbital momentum Lz. It comes into play whenever the eﬀects
of axial magnetic ﬁelds on the electron may show up. There is also a deep
connection between ml and the orbital quantum number l, which in turn
determines the modulus of the orbital momentum of the electron.

The interpretation of the orbital number l does not miss some problems.
Let us examine eq. 33 that corresponds to the radial wavefunction R(r).
This equation rules only the radial motion of the electron, i.e., with the
relative distance with respect to the nucleus along some guiding ellipses.
However, the total energy of the electron E is also present. This energy
includes the kineticelctron energy in its orbital motion that is not related
to the radial motion. This contradiction can be eliminated by the following
argument. The kinetic energy T has two parts: Tradial due to the radial
oscillatory motion and Torbital, which is due to the closed orbital motion.
The potential energy V of the electron is the electrostatic energy. Therefore,
its total energy is

E = Tradial + Torbital −

e2

4πǫ0r

.

(35)

Substituting this expression of E in eq. 33 we get with some regrouping of
the terms

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

If the last two terms in parentheses compansates between themselves, we
get a diﬀerential equation for the pure radial motion. Thus, we impose the
condition

Torbital =

¯h2l(l + 1)

2mr2

.

However, the orbital kinetic energy of the electron is

Torbital =

1
2

mv2

orbital

and since the orbital momentum of the electron L is

we can express the orbital kinetic energy in the form

L = mvorbitalr ,

Torbital =

L2
2mr2 .

118

Therefore, we have

and consequently

L2
2mr2 =

¯h2l(l + 1)

2mr2

L =ql(l + 1)¯h .

(41)

(42)

The interpretation of this result is that since the orbital quantum number l
is constrained to take the values l = 0, 1, 2, ..., (n − 1), the electron can only
have orbital momenta L speciﬁed by means of eq. 42. As in the case of the
total energy E, the angular momentum is conserved and gets quantized. Its
natural unit in quantum mechanics is ¯h = h/2π = 1.054 × 10−34 J.s.
In the macroscopic planetary motion (putting aside the many-body fea-
tures), the orbital quantum number is so large that any direct experimental
detection is impossible. For example, an electron with l = 2 has an angular
momentum L = 2.6× 10−34 J.s., whereas the terrestrial angular momentum
is 2.7 × 1040 J.s.!
A common notation for the angular momentum states is by means of
the letter s for l = 0, p for l = 1, d for l = 2, and so on. This alphabetic
code comes from the empirical spectroscopic classiﬁcation in terms of the
so-called series, which was in use before the advent of quantum mechanics.
The combination of the principal quantum number with the latter cor-
responding to the angular momentum is another frequently used notation
in atomic and molecular physics.. For example, a state for which n = 2 and
l = 0 is a state 2s, while a state n = 4 and l = 2 is a state 4d.

On the other hand, for the interpretation of the magnetic quantum num-
ber, we shall take into account, as we did for the linear momentum, that
the orbital momentum is a vector operator and therefore one has to specify
its direction, sense, and modulus. L, being a vector product, is perpendic-
ular on the plane of rotation. The geometric rules of the vectorial products
still hold, in particular the rule of the right hand:
its direction and sense
are given by the right thumb whenever the other four ﬁngers point at the
direction of rotation.

But what signiﬁcance can be associated to a direction and sense in the
limited space of the atomic hydrogen ? The answer may be quick if we
think that the rotating electron is nothing but a one-electron loop current
that considered as a magnetic dipole has a corresponding magnetic ﬁeld.
Consequently, an atomic electron will always interact with an applied mag-
netic B. The magnetic quantum number ml speciﬁes the spatial direction
of L, which is determined by the component of L along the direction of the

119

external magnetic ﬁeld. This eﬀect is commonly known as the quantization
of the space in a magnetic ﬁeld.

If we choose the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld as the z axis, the com-

ponent of L along this direction is

Lz = ml¯h .

(43)
The possible values of ml for a given value of l, go from +l to −l, passing
through zero, so that there are 2l + 1 possible orientations of the angular
momentum L in a magnetic ﬁeld. When l = 0, Lz can be only zero; whenl =
1, Lz can be ¯h, 0, or −¯h; when l = 2, Lz takes only one of the values 2¯h, ¯h,
0, −¯h, or −2¯h, and so forth. It is worth mentioning that L cannot be put
exactly parallel or anti-parallel to B, because Lz is always smaller than the
moduluspl(l + 1)¯h of the total orbital momentum.

The spatial quantization of the orbital momentum for the hydrogen atom

is shown in ﬁg. 6.1 in a particular case.

Fig. 6.1: The spatial quantization of the electron angular momentum for states

l = 2, L = √6¯h.

One should consider the atom/electron characterized by a given ml as
having the orientation of its angular momentum L determined relative to
the external applied magnetic ﬁeld.

In the absence of the external magnetic ﬁeld, the direction of the z axis
is fully arbitrary. Therefore, the component of L in any arbitrary chosen

120

direction is ml¯h; the external magnetic ﬁeld oﬀers a preferred reference
direction from the experimental viewpoint.

Why is quantized only the component Lz ? The answer is related to
the fact that L cannot be put along a direction in an arbitrary way.
Its
‘vectorial arrow’ moves always along a cone centered on the quantization
axis such that its projection Lz is ml¯h. The reason why such a phenomenon
occurs is due to the uncertainty principle. If L would be ﬁxed in space, in
such a way that Lx, Ly and Lz would have well-deﬁned values, the electron
would have to be conﬁned to a well-deﬁned plane. For example, if L would
be ﬁxed along the z direction, the electron tends to maintain itself in the
plane xy (ﬁg. 6.2a).

Fig. 6.2: The uncertainty principle forbids a ﬁxed direction in space of the

angular momentum.

This can occur only in the case in which the component pz of the elec-
tron momentum is ‘inﬁnitely’ uncertain. This is however impossible if the
electron is part of the hydrogen atom. But since in reality just the compo-
nent Lz of L together with L2 have well-deﬁned values and | L |>| Lz |, the
electron is not constrained to a single plane (ﬁg. 6.2b). If this would be the
case, an uncertainty would exist in the coordinate z of the electron. The
direction of L changes continuously (see ﬁg. 6.3), so that the mean values
of Lx and Ly are zero, although Lz keeps all the time its value ml¯h.

121

Fig. 6.3: The angular momentum displays a constant precession around the z axis.

The solution for Φ should also fulﬁll the normalization condition given

by eq. 2. Thus, we have

Z 2π

0

| Φ |2 dφ = 1

and substituting Φ, one gets

Z 2π

It follows that Aφ = 1/√2π, and thefore the normalized Φ is

For the case of quantum mechanics, Θ(θ) is given by the normalized associ-
ated Legendre polynomials. Thus, if

Θ(θ) = AθP ml

then the normalization condition is

Therefore, the normalization constant for the polar part is given by

and consequently, the function Θ(θ) already normalized reads

For our purposes here, the most important property of these functions
is that they exist only when the constant l is an integer number greater or
at least equal to | ml |, which is the absolute value of ml. This condition
can be written in the form of the set of values available for ml

ml = 0,±1,±2, ...,±l .

(53)

Uniﬁcation of the azimuthal and polar parts: spherical har-
monics

The solutions of the azimuthal and polar parts can be uniﬁed within spher-
ical harmonics functions that depend on both φ and θ. This simpliﬁes the
algebraic manipulations of the full wave functions ψ(r, θ, φ). Spherical har-
monics are introduced as follows

The supplementary factor (−1)ml does not produce any problem because
the Schr¨odinger equation is linear and homogeneous. This factor is added
for the sake of convenience in angular momentum studies. It is known as the
Condon-Shortley phase factor and its eﬀect is to introduce an alternance of
the signs ± for the spherical harmonics.

Solution for the radial part

The solution for the radial part R(r) of the wave function ψ of the hydrogen
atom is somewhat more complicated. It is here where signiﬁcant diﬀerences
with respect to the electrostatic Laplace equation do occur. The ﬁnal result
is expressed analytically in terms of the associated Laguerre polynomials
(Schr¨odinger 1926). The radial equation can be solved in exact way only
when E is positive or for one of the following negative values En (in which
cases, the electron is in a bound stationary state within atomic hydrogen)

En = −

where n is an integer number called the principal quantum number.
It
gives the quantization of the electron energy in the hydrogen atom. This
discrete atomic spectrum has been ﬁrst obtained in 1913 by Bohr using semi-
empirical quantization methods and next by Pauli and Schr¨odinger almost
simultaneously in 1926.

Another condition that should be satisﬁed to solve the radial equation is
that n have to be strictly bigger than l. Its lowest value is l + 1 for a givem
l. Vice versa, the condition on l is

l = 0, 1, 2, ..., (n − 1)

for given n.

The radial equation can be written in the form

(56)

(57)

Dividing by r2 and using the substitution χ(r) = rR to eliminate the ﬁrst
derivative dR
dr , one gets the standard form of the radial Schr¨odinger equation
displaying the eﬀective potential U (r) = −const/r + l(l + 1)/r2 (actually,
electrostatic potential plus quantized centrifugal barrier). These are nec-
essary mathematical steps in order to discuss a new boundary condition,

124

since the spectrum is obtained by means of the R equation. The diﬀerence
between a radial Schr¨odinger equation and a full-line one is that a suppli-
mentary boundary condition should be imposed at the origin (r = 0). The
coulombian potential belongs to a class of potentials that are called weak
singular for which limr→0 = U (r)r2 = 0. In these cases, one tries solutions
of the type χ ∝ rν, implying ν(ν − 1) = l(l + 1), so that the solutions are
ν1 = l + 1 and ν2 = −l, just as in electrostatics. The negative solution is
eliminated for l 6= 0 because it leads to a divergent normalization constant,
nor did it respect the normalization at the delta function for the continuous
part of the spectrum. On the other hand, the particular case ν2 = 0 is elmin-
inated because the mean kinetic energy is not ﬁnite. The ﬁnal conclusion is
that χ(0) = 0 for any l.

Going back to the analysis of the radial equation for R, ﬁrst thing to do
is to write it in nondimensional variables. This is performed by noticing that
the only space and time scales that one can form on combining the three
fundamental constants entering this problem, namely e2, me and ¯h are the
Bohr radius a0 = ¯h2/me2 = 0.529· 10−8 cm. and t0 = ¯h3/me4 = 0.24210−16
sec., usually known as atomic units. Employing these units, one gets

where we are especially interested in the discrete part of the spectrum (E <

Because of the normalization condition only the decaying exponential is
acceptable. On the other hand, the asymptotics at zero, as we already com-
mented on, should be R ∝ ρl. Therefore, we can write R as a product
of three radial functions R = ρle−ρ/2F (ρ), of which the ﬁrst two give the
asymptotic behaviors, whereas the third is the radial function in the inter-
mediate region. The latter function is of most interest because its features
determine the energy spectrum. The equation for F is

This is a particular case of conﬂuent hypergeometric equation for which
the two ‘hyper’geometric parameters depend on the pair of quantum num-
bers n, l. It can be identiﬁed as the equation for the associated Laguerre
polynomials L2l+1

n+l (ρ). Thus, the normalized form of R is

We have now the solutions of all the equations depending on a single

The latter formula may be considered as the ﬁnal result for the Schr¨odinger

solution of the hydrogen atom for any stationary electron state. Indeed, one
can see explicitly both the asmptotic dependence and the two orthogonal
and complete sets of functions, i.e., the associated Laguerre polynomials
and the spherical harmonics that correspond to this particular case of lin-
ear partial second-order diﬀerential equation. The parabolic coordinates
[ξ = r(1 − cos θ), η = r(1 + cos θ), φ = φ], are another coordinate system in
which the Schr¨odinger hydrogen equation is separable (E. Schr¨odinger, Ann.
Physik 80, 437, 1926; P.S. Epstein, Phys. Rev. 28, 695, 1926; I. Waller,
Zf. Physik 38, 635, 1926). The ﬁnal solution in this case is expressed as the
product of factors of asymptotic nature, azimuthal harmonics, and two sets
of associate Laguerre polynomials in the variables ξ and η, respectively. The
energy spectrum (−1/n2) and the degeneracy (n2) of course do not depend
on the coordinate system.

126

Electronic probability density

In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, the electron rotates around the nu-
cleus on circular or elliptic trajectories. It is possible to think of appropriate
experiments allowing to “see” that the electron moves within experimental
errors at the predicted radii r = n2a0 (where n is the principal quantum
number labeling the orbit and a0 = 0.53 ˚A is the Bohr radius) in the equa-
torial plane θ = 90o, whereas the azimuthal angle may vary according to the
speciﬁc experimental conditions.

The more rigorous quantum theory changes the conclusions of the Bohr
model in at least two important aspects. First, one cannot speak about exact
values of r, θ, φ, but only of relative probabilities to ﬁnd the electron within
an inﬁnitesimal given region of space. This feature is a consequence of the
wave nature of the electron. Secondly, the electron does not move around
the nucleus in the classical conventional way because the probability density
| ψ |2 does not depend on time but can vary substantially as a function of
the relative position of the inﬁnitesimal region.
The hydrogenic electron wave function ψ is ψ = RΘΦ, where R = Rnl(r)
describes the way ψ changes with r when the principal and orbital quantum
numbers have the values n and l, respectively. Θ = Θlml(θ) describes in
turn how ψ varies with θ when the orbital and magnetic quantum numbers
have the values l and ml, respectively. Finally, Φ = Φml(φ) gives the change
of ψ with φ when the magnetic quantum number has the value ml. The
probability density | ψ |2 can be written

| ψ |2=| R |2| Θ |2| Φ |2 .

(65)

Notice that the probability density | Φ |2, which measures the possibility
to ﬁnd the electron at a given azimuthal angle φ, is a constant (does not
depend on φ). Therefore, the electronic probability density is symmetric
with respect to the z axis and independent on the magnetic substates (at
least until an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied). Consequently, the electron
has an equal probability to be found in any azimuthal direction. The radial
part R of the wave function, contrary to Φ, not only varies with r, but it
does it diﬀerently for any diﬀerent combination of quantum numbers n and
l. Fig. 6.4 shows plots of R as a function of r for the states 1s, 2s, and
2p. R is maximum at the center of the nucleus (r = 0) for all the s states,
whereas it is zero at r = 0 for all the states of nonzero angular momentum.

The electronic probability density at the point r, θ, φ is proportional to
| ψ |2, but the real probability in the inﬁnitesimal volume element dV is
| ψ |2 dV . In spherical coordinates

dV = r2 sin θdrdθdφ ,

(66)

128

and since Θ and Φ are normalized functions, the real numerical probability
P (r)dr to ﬁnd the electron at a relative distance with respect to the nucleus
between r and r + dr is

P (r)dr = r2 | R |2 drZ π
= r2 | R |2 dr

(67)

P (r) is displayed in ﬁg. 6.5 for the same states for which the radial func-
tions R appear in ﬁg. 6.4. In principle, the curves are quite diﬀerent. We
immediately see that P (r) is not maximal in the nucleus for the states s, as
happens for R. Instead, their maxima are encountered at a ﬁnite distance
from the nucleus. The most probable value of r for a 1s electron is exactly
a0, the Bohr radius. However, the mean value of r for a 1s electron is 1.5a0.
At ﬁrst sight this might look strange, because the energy levels are the same
both in quantum mechanics and in Bohr’s model. This apparent unmatch-
ing is eliminitated if one takes into account that the electron energy depends
on 1/r and not on r, and the mean value of 1/r for a 1s electron is exactly
1/a0.

The function Θ varies with the polar angle θ for all the quantum num-
bers l and ml, unless l = ml = 0, which are the s states. The probability
density | Θ |2 for a s state is a constant (1/2). This means that since | Φ |2
is also a constant, the electronic probability density | ψ |2 has the same
value for a given r value, not depending on the direction. In other states,
the electrons present an angular behavior that in many cases may be quite
complicated. This can be seen in ﬁg.6.5, where the electronic probability
densities for diﬀerent atomic states are displayed as a function of r and θ.
(The plotted term is | ψ |2 and not | ψ |2 dV ). Because | ψ |2 is independent
of φ, a three-dimensional representation of | ψ |2 can be obtained by rotat-
ing a particular representation around a vertical axis. This can prove that
the probability densities for the s states have spherical symmetry, while all
the other states do not possess it.
In this way, one can get more or less
pronounced lobes of characteristic forms depending on state. These lobes
are quite important in chemistry for specifying the atomic interaction in the
molecular bulk.

6N. Note:
1. In 1933, E. Schr¨odinger has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics (to-
gether with Dirac) for the “discovery of new productive forms of atomic the-
ory”. Schr¨odinger wrote a remarkable series of four papers “Quantisierung

ceived by Annalen der Physik on 27 January, 23 February, 10 May and 21

is λ = h
If we now use the value 5.3 × 10−11m for the radius
r of the electron orbit, we can see that the wavelength of the electron is
λ = 33× 10−11 m. But this is exactly the same value as of the circumference
of the orbit, 2πr = 33 × 10−11 m. One may say that the electron orbit
in the atomic hydrogen corresponds to a wave “closing into itself” (i.e.,
stationary). This fact can be compared to the vibrations of a metallic ring. If
the wavelengths are multiples of the circumference, the ring goes on with its
vibrations for a long time with very small dissipation If, on the other hand,
the number of wavelengths making a circumference is not an integer, the
interference of the waves is negative and they dissapear in a short period of
time. One may say that the electron will rotate around the nucleus without
radiating its energy for an inﬁnite time as far as its orbit contains an integer
number of de Broglie wavelengths. Thus, the stability/stationary condition
is

nλ = 2πrn ,

where rn is the radius of the electron orbit containing n wavelengths. Sub-

7. QUANTUM SCATTERING

Introduction

One usually begins the quantum theory of scattering by referring to results
already known from the classical scattering in central ﬁelds with some sim-
plifying assumptions helping to avoid unnecessary calculations in getting
basic results. It is generally known that studying scatterings in the labo-
ratory provides information on the distribution of matter in the target and
other details of the interaction between the incident beam and the target.
The hypotheses that we shall assume correct in the following are

i) The particles are spinless. This, of course, does not mean that spin

eﬀects are not important in quantum scatterings.

ii) We shall study only elastic scattering for which the internal structure

of the particles is not taken into account.

iii) The target is suﬃciently thin to neglect multiple scatterings.
iv) The interactions are described by a potential that depends only on

the relative distance between the particles (central potential).

These hypotheses eliminate some quantum eﬀects that are merely details.
They also represent conditions for getting the quantum analogs of basic
classical results. We now deﬁne

dσ
dΩ ∝

I(θ, ϕ)

I0

,

(1)

where dΩ is the solid angle inﬁnitesimal element, I0 is the number of inci-
dent particles per unit transverse area, and IdΩ is the number of scattered
particles in the solid angle element.

Employing these well-known concepts, together with the asymptotic no-
tion of impact parameter b associated to each classical incident particle, one
gets in classical mechanics the following important formula

dσ
dΩ

=

b
sin θ|

db
dθ| .

(2)

If one wants to study the scattering phenomenology in quantum ter-
minology, one should investigate the time evolution of a ‘scattering’ wave
packet. Let Fi be the ﬂux of incident particles, i.e., the number of parti-
cles per unit of time passing through the unit of transverse surface onto the
propagation axis. An appropriate detector conﬁguration is usually placed

133

far away from the eﬀective interaction region, ‘seeing’ a solid angle dΩ of
that region. In general, the number of particles dn/dt scattered per unit of
time in dΩ in the direction (θ, ϕ) is detected.

dn/dt is proportional to dΩ and Fi. Let us call σ(θ, ϕ) the coeﬃcient of
proportionality between dn and FidΩ:

dn = σ(θ, ϕ)FidΩ ,

(3)

which is by deﬁnition the diﬀerential cross section.

The number of particles per unit of time reaching the detector is equal
to the number of particles crossing the surface σ(θ, ϕ)dΩ, which is perpen-
dicular to the beam axis. The total section is by deﬁnition

To further simplify the calculation, we choose the z axis along the inci-

dent beam direction.
On the negative side of the axis, for large negative t, the particle is prac-
tically free:
it is not aﬀected by V (r) and its state can be represented by
plane waves. Therefore, the wave function contains terms of the form eikz,
where k is the constant ocurring in the Helmholtz equation. By analogy
with optics, the form of the scattered wave is

f (r) =

eikr
r

.

where ψ is a function that is nonzero in a ‘width’ ∆k centered on k0. We
also assume that k0 is antiparallel to r0.
In order to see quantitatively
what happens to the wave packet when scatters the target, one can use
the expansion of ψ(r, 0) in the eigenfunctions ψn(r) of H, i.e., ψ(r, 0) =

(14)

This condition tells us that the wave packet does not disperse signiﬁcantly
even when it moves over amacroscopic distance r0.

Choosing the direction of the vector k of the incident wave along one of
the three cartesian directions (we use the z one), we can write in spherical
coordinates the following important formula

ψk(r, θ, ϕ) ≃ eikz + f (k,θ,ϕ)eikr

r

.

Since the Hamiltonian H, up to now not considered as an operator (the
class of the results presented are the same both at the classical and quantum
level), is invariant under z rotations, we can choose boundary conditions of
spherical symmetry too. Thus

ψk(r, θ, ϕ) ≃ eikz + f (θ)eikr

.

This type of functions are known as scattering wave functions. The coeﬃ-
cient f (θ) of the spherical wave is known as the scattering amplitude. It is
a basic concept in the formal theory of quantum scatterings.

Green’s function in scattering theory
Another way of writing the Schr¨odinger equation at hand is (− ¯h2
2m∇2+V )ψ =
Eψ, or (∇2 + k2)ψ = U ψ, where k2 = 2mE
It follows that it is more convenient to put this equation in an integral
form. This can be done if we consider U ψ in the right hand side of the
equation as a inhomogeneity. This allows to build the solution by means of
Green’s function (integral kernel), which, by deﬁnition, is the solution of

¯h2 , ¸si U = 2mV
¯h2 .

(∇2 + k2)G(r, r′) = δ(r − r′) .

(25)

One can write now the Schr¨odinger solution as the sum of the homogeneous
equation and the inhomogeneous one of Green’s type

ψ(r) = λ(r) −Z G(r, r′)U(r′)ψ(r′)d3r′ .

(26)

We seek now a G function in the form of a product of linear independent

functions, for example, plane waves

G(r, r′ =Z A(q)eiq·(r−r′)dq .

Using eq. 25, we have

Z A(q)(k2 − q2)eiq·(r−r′)dq = δ(r − r′) ,

which turns in an identity if

A(q) = (2π)−3(k2 − q2)−1 .

138

(27)

(29)

Thus

G(r, r′) =

(31)

This function is not determined univoquely since the Green function can
be any solution of the eq. 25. The right particular solution is chosen by
imposing boundary conditions on the eigenfunctions ψk(r).

The Green function obtained in this way is

G(r, r′) = −  eik|r−r′|

4π|r − r′|! .

(32)

Thus, we ﬁnally get the integral equation for the scattering wave function

then
(34)

(∇2 + k2)ψ = (∇2 + k2)[ϕ +Z G(r, r′)U (r′)ψ(r′)d3r′]

and assuming that we can change the order of operations and put the ∇
operator inside the integral, we get

(∇2 + k2)ψ =Z (∇2 + k2)G(r, r′)U (r′)ψ(r′)d3r′ = U (r)ψ(r) ,

which is known as the optical theorem. Its physical signiﬁcance is related to
the fact that the interference of the incident wave with the dispersed wave
at zero/forward angle produces the “getting out” of the particle from the
incident wave, allowing in this way the conservation of the probability.

approxiamtely equal to the projection of MP onto MO

The latter is already not a function of the distance r = OM , but only of θ
and ψ. Thus

We deﬁne now the incident wave vector ki as a vector of modulus k directed
along the polar axis of the beam. Then eikz = eiki·r. Similarly, kd, of
modulus k and of direction ﬁxed by θ and ϕ, is called the shifted wave
vector in the direction (θ, ϕ): kd = ku.

The momentum transfer in the direction (θ, ϕ) is introduced as the vec-

torial diﬀerence K = kd − ki.

Hence we can write the integral equation in the form

One can try to solve this equation iteratively. Putting r → r′; r′ → r′′,

we can write

ψ(r′) = eiki·r′

+Z G(r′, r′′)U (r′′)ψ(r′′)d3r′′ .

Substituting in 45, we get

The ﬁrst two terms in the right hand side are known and it is only
the third one that includes the unknown function ψ(r). We can repeat the
procedure: substituting r by r′′, and r′ by r′′′, we get ψ(r′′) , that we can
reintroduce in the eq. 47

ψ(r) = eiki·r +Z G(r, r′)U (r′)eiki·r′

The ﬁrst three terms are now known and the unknown function ψ(r) has
been sent to the fourth term. In this way, by succesive iterations we can
build the stationary dispersed wave function. Notice that each term of the
series expansion has one more power in the potential with respect to the
previous one. We can go on until we get a neglijible expression in the right
hand side, obtaining ψ(r) as a function of only known quantities.

K is the momentum transfer vector. Thus, the diﬀerential cross section is
simply related to the potential, V (r) = ¯h2
2m U (r). Since σ(θ, ϕ) = |f (θ, ϕ)|2,
the result is

σ(B)(θ, ϕ) =

4π2¯h4|Z e−iK·rV (r)d3r|2

(50)

The direction and modulus of K depends on the modulus k of ki and kd as
well as on the scattering direction (θ, ϕ). For given θ and ϕ, it is a function
of k, the energy of the incident beam. Analogously, for a given energy, σ(B)
is a function of θ and ϕ. Born’s approximation allows one to get information
on the potential V (r) from the dependence of the diﬀerential cross section
on the scattering direction and the incident energy.

8. PARTIAL WAVES

Introduction

The partial waves method is quite general and applies to particles interact-
ing in very small spatial regions with another one, which is usually known
as scattering center because of its physical characteristics.
(for example,
because it can be considered as ﬁxed). Beyond the interaction region, the
interaction between the two particles is usually negligible. Under this cir-
cumstances, it is possible to describe the scattered particle by means of the
Hamiltonian

H = H0 + V ,

(1)

where H0 corresponds to the free particle Hamiltonian. Our problem is to
solve the equation

Obviously, the spectrum will be continuous since we study the case of

(H0 + V ) | ψi = E | ψi .

(2)

elastic scattering. The solution will be

| ψi =

1

E − H0

V | ψi+ | φi .

(3)

It is easy to see that for V = 0 one can obtain the solution | φi, i.e.,
the solution corresponding to the free particle. It is worth noting that in a
is anomalous, because it has a continuum
certain sense the operator
of poles on the real axis at positions coinciding with the eigenvalues of H0.
To get out of this trouble, it is common to produce a small shift in the
imaginary direction (±iǫ) of the cut on the real axis

E−H0

1

| ψ±i =

1

E − H0 ± iε

V | ψ±i+ | φi

(4)

This equation is known as the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Finally,
the shift of the poles is performed in the positive sense of the imaginary
axis because in this case the causality principle holds (cf. Feynman). Let us
consider the x representation

hx | ψ±i = hx | φi +Z d3x

′(cid:28)x|

E − H0 ± iε|x

′

′(cid:29)hx

| V | ψ±i .

(5)

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side corresponds to a free particle,
while the second one is interpreted as a spherical wave getting out from the

147

scattering center. The kernel of the previous integral can be considered as
a Green function (also called propagator in quantum mechanics).
It is a
simple matter to calculate it

Let us now deﬁne an operator T such that
T | φi = V | ψ+i

| V | ψ+i .

(8)

(9)

If we multiply the Lippmann-Schwinger equation by V and make use of

the previous deﬁnition, we get

T | φi = V | φi + V

1

E − H0 + iε

T | φi .

(10)

Iterating this equation (as in perturbation theory) we can get the Born
approximation and its higher-order corrections.

Partial waves method

Let us now consider the case of a central potential. In this case, using the
deﬁnition (9), it is found that the operator T commutes with ~L2 and ~L; it is
said that T is a scalar operator. To simplify the calculations it is convenient
to use spherical coordinates, because of the symmetry of the problem that

This expression can be interpreted as follows. The two exponential terms
correspond to spherical waves: the ﬁrst to a divergent wave, and the latter to
a convergent one. Moreover, the scattering eﬀect is conveniently displayed
in the coeﬃcient of the divergent wave, which is unity when there are no
scattering centers.

149

Phase shifts

We consider now a surface enclosing the scattering center. Assuming that
there is no creation and annihilation of particles, one has

Z j · dS = 0 ,

(17)

where the integration region is the aforementioned surface, and j is the
probability current density. Moreover, because of the conservation of the
orbital momentum, the latter equation should hold for each partial wave.
The theoretical formulation of the problem does not change if one assumes
the wave packet as a ﬂux of noninteracting particles propagating through a
region of central potential for which the angular momentum of each particle
is conserved, so that the ‘particle’ content of the wave packet really does not
change. Thus, one may think even intuitevely that only phase factor eﬀects
can be introduced under these circumstances. Thus, if one deﬁnes

we should have

Sl(k) ≡ 1 + 2ikfl(k)

| Sl(k) |= 1 .

(18)

(19)

These results can be interpreted using the conservation of probabilities.
They are natural and expected because we assumed that there is no particle
creation and annihilation. Therefore, the eﬀects of the scattering center is
reduced to adding a phase factor in the components of the divergent wave.
Taking into account the unitarity of the phase factor, we can write it in the
form

Sl = e2iδl ,

(20)

where δl is real and a function of k. Taking into account the deﬁnition (18),
we can write

Getting the phase shifts

Let us consider now a potential V that is zero for r > R, where the parameter
R is known as the range of the potential. Thus, the region r > R corresponds
to a spherical unperturbed/free wave. On the other hand, the general form
of the expansion of a plane wave in spherical ones is

hx | ψ+i =

(2π)3/2Xl

This allows to write the radial wave function for r > R in the form

Al = e2iδl [cos δljl(kr) − sin δlnl(kr)] .

(25)

(26)

(27)

Using the latter equation, we can get the logarithmic derivative in r = R,

i.e., at the boundary of the potential range

(29)

To get the complete solution of the problem in this case, it is necessary
to make the calculations for r < R, i.e., within the range of the potential.
For a central potential, the 3D Schr¨odinger equation reads

d2ul

dr2 +(cid:18)k2 −

2m
¯h2 V −

l(l + 1)

r2 (cid:19) ul = 0 ,

(30)

where ul = rAl(r) is constrained by the boundary condition ul |r=0 =
0. Thus, one can calculate the logarithmic derivative, which, taking into
account the continuity of the log-derivative (equivalent to the continuity
condition of the derivative at a discontinuity point) leads to

βl |in= βl |out

.

(31)

An example: scattering on a hard sphere

Let us now consider an important illustrative case, that of the hard sphere
potential

V =( ∞ r < R

r > R .

0

(32)

It is known that a particle cannot penetrate into a region where the
potential is inﬁnite. Therefore, the wave function should be zero at r = R.
Since we deal with an impenetrable sphere we also have

Thus, from eq. (27), we get

Al(r) |r=R= 0 .

tan δl =

jl(kR)
nl(kR)

.

(33)

(34)

One can see that the phase shift calculation is an easy one for any l. In

the l = 0 case (s wave scattering), we have

δl = −kR

152

and from eq. (27)

Al=0(r) ∼

sin kr

kr

cos δ0 +

cos kr

kr

sin δ0 =

kr

sin(kr + δ0) .

(35)

We immediately see that there is an additional phase contribution with
regard to the motion of the free particle. It is also clear that in more general
cases the various waves will have diﬀerent phase shifts leading to a transient
distortion of the scattered wave packet. At small energies, i.e., kR << 1,
the spherical Bessel functions (entering the formulas for the spherical Hankel
functions) are the following

jl(kr) ∼

nl(kr) ∼ −

(kr)l

(2l + 1)!!
(2l − 1)!!
(kr)l+1

,

(36)

(37)

(38)

(40)

(41)

leading to

tan δl =

−(kR)2l+1

(2l + 1)[(2l − 1)!!]2 .

From this formula, one can see that a substantial contribution to the
phase shift is given by the l = 0 waves. Moreover, since δ0 = −kR the cross
section is obtained as follows

σtotal =Z dσ

dΩ

dΩ = 4πR2 .

(39)

One can see that the total scattering cross section is four times bigger
than the classical one and coincides with the total area of the impenetrable
sphere. For large values of the incident energy, one can work in the hypoth-
esis that all values of l up to a maximum value lmax ∼ kR contribute to the
total cross section

σtotal =

4π
k2

l∼kRXl=0

(2l + 1)sin2δl .

In this way, from eq. (34), we have

sin2δl =

have been used.

Inspection of δl shows a negative jump of π

2 whenever l is augmented by
a unity. Thus, it is clear that sin2δl + sin2δl+1 = 1 holds. Approximating
sin2δl by its mean value 1
2 over a period and using the sum of odd numbers,
one gets

σtotal =

4π

(42)

Once again the quantum-mechanical result, although quite similar to the
corresponding classical result is nevertheless diﬀerent. What might be the
origin of the factor of two that makes the diﬀerence ? To get an explanation,
we ﬁrst separate eq. (15) in two parts

f (θ) =

This formula is rather well known in optics. It corresponds to the Fraun-

(46)

Finally, neglecting the interference between freﬂ and f shadow (since
the phase oscillates between 2δl+1 = 2δl − π), one gets the result (42). The
label ‘shadow’ for one of the terms is easily explained if one thinks of the
wavy behaviour of the scattered particle (from the physical viewpoint there
is no diﬀerence between a wave packet and a particle in this case). Its origin
can be traced back to the backward-scattered components of the wave packet
leading to a phase shift with respect to the incident waves and destructive
interference.

Coulomb scattering

In this section we brieﬂy consider the Coulomb scattering in the quantum-
mechanical approach. For this case, the Schr¨odinger equation is

 −

¯h2
2m∇2 −

Z1Z2e2

r

! ψ(r) = Eψ(r),

E > 0 ,

(47)

where m is the reduced mass of the system, E > 0 since we deal with the
simple scattering case where no kind of bound states are allowed to form.
The previous equation is equivalent to the following expression (for adequate
values of the constants k and γ)

(cid:18)∇2 + k2 +

2γk

r (cid:19) ψ(r) = 0 .

(48)

If we do not consider the centrifugal barrier, i.e., we look only to the s
waves, we really deal with a pure coulombian interaction, for which one can
propose a solution of the following form

ψ(r) = eik·rχ(u) ,

(49)

where

u = ikr(1 − cos θ) = ik(r − z) = ikw ,

k · r = kz .

ψ(r) is the complete solution of the Schr¨odinger equation with an asymptotic
‘physical’ behaviour to which a plane wave eik·r and a spherical wave are
expected to contribute r−1eikr are expected to contribute. Deﬁning new
variables

and by employing of previous relationships, eq. (48) takes the form

z = z

w = r − z

λ = φ ,

"u

d2
du2 + (1 − u)

d

du − iγ# χ(u) = 0 .

(50)

To solve this equation, one should ﬁrst study its asymptotic behaviour.
Since we have already tackled this issue, we merely present the asymptotic
normalized wave function that is the ﬁnal result of all previous calculations

ψk(r) =

1

(2π)3/2  ei[k·r−γln(kr−k·r)] +

fc(k, θ)ei[kr+γln2kr]

(51)

155

As one can see, this wave function displays terms that turns it quite dif-
ferent from the form in eq. (7). This is due to the fact that the Coulomb po-
tential is of inﬁnite range. Performing the exact calculation for the Coulomb
scattering amplitude is not an easy matter. Here we give only the ﬁnal result
for the ‘normalized’ wave function

ψk(r) =

(52)

where g1(γ) =

Γ(1−iγ) .

In addition, we reduce the partial wave analysis to a clear cut presenta-
tion of the results, of which some have already been mentioned. First of all,
we write the wave function ψ(r) in (49) as follows

ψ(r) = eik·rχ(u) = Aeik·rZC

euttiγ−1(1 − t)−iγdt ,

(53)

where A is a ‘normalization’ constant, while all the integral part is the
inverse Laplace transform of the direct transform of eq. (50). A convenient
form of the latter equation is

ψ(r) = AZC

eik·r(1 − t)eikrt(1 − t)d(t, γ)dt

where

d(t, γ) = tiγ−1(1 − t)−iγ−1 .

Within the partial wave analysis we proceed by writing

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

where

ψ(r) =

(2l + 1)ilPl(cos θ)Al(kr) ,

∞Xl=0
Al(kr) = AZC
eikrtjl[kr(1 − t)](1 − t)d(t, γ) .

Applying the relationships between the spherical Bessel functions and

the Hankel functions, we get

Al(kr) = A(1)

where

e2iηl(k) =

Γ(1 + l − iγ)

(61)

Calculation of the Coulomb scattering amplitude

If we perform the Laplace transform of eq. (50), we get

χ(u) = AZC

euttiγ−1(1 − t)−iγdt .

(62)

The contour C goes from −∞ to ∞ on the real axis and closes through
the upper half-plane. There are two poles in this case at t = 0 and t = 1.
By the change of variable s = ut, we get

χ(u) = AZC1

essiγ−1(u − s)−iγ .

χ(u) should be regular in zero. Indeed, we get

χ(0) = (−1)−iγAZC1

Performing now the limit u → ∞, let’s do an inﬁnitesimal shift to avoid
the location of the poles on the contour. Moreover, by the change of variable
u = − (s0±iε)
s
, we see that this expression goes to zero when u → ∞. Thus,
we can expand (u − s) in power series of s
u for the pole with s = 0. This
expansion is not the right one in s = 1, because in this case s = −s0+i(κ±ε).
It comes out that s
tends to 1 when κ → ∞. If instead we do
the change of variable s

χ(u) = AZC2(cid:18)[essiγ−1(u − s)−iγ]ds + [es

Expanding the power series, it is easy to calculate the previous integrals,

After all this chain of variable changes, we get back to the original s one

to obtain

(u∗)iγ = (−i)iγ[k(r − z)]iγ = eγπ/2eiγ ln k(r−z)
(u)−iγ = (i)−iγ [k(r − z)]−iγ = eγπ/2e−iγ ln k(r−z) .

(67)

The calculation of χ, once eﬀected, is equivalent with having ψk(r) start-

ing from (49).

Eikonal approximation

We shall brieﬂy expound on the eikonal approximation whose philosophy
is the same to that used when one wants to pass from the wave optics to
the geometrical optics. Therefore, it is the right approximation when the
potential varies slowly over distances comparable to to the wavelength of
the scattered wave packet, i.e., for the case E >> |V |. Thus, this approx-
imation may be considered as a quasiclassical one. First, we propose that
the quasiclassical wave function has the known form

ψ ∼ eiS(r)/¯h ,

(68)

where S satisﬁes the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, having the solution

The additive constant is chosen in such a way to fulﬁll

S

for

V → 0 .

(70)

The term multiplying the potential can be interpreted as a change of

phase of of the wave packet, having the following explicit form

∆(b) ≡ −m

2k¯h2Z ∞

−∞

V (cid:16)pb2 + z2(cid:17) dz .

(71)

Within the method of partial waves, the eikonal approximation has the
following application. We know it is correct at high energies, where many

158

partial waves do contribute to the scattering. Thus, we can consider l as
a continuous variable and by analogy to classical mechanics we let l = bk.
Moreover, as we already mentioned lmax = kR, which plugged into eq. (15)
leads to

f (θ) = −ikZ bJ0(kbθ)[e2i∆(b) − 1]db .

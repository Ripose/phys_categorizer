Abstract

We discuss a couple of simple quasistatic electromagnetic systems in which the density of elec-

tromagnetic linear momentum can be easily computed. The examples are also used to illustrate

how the total electromagnetic linear momentum, which may also be calculated by using the vector

potential, can be understood as a consequence of the violation of the action-reaction principle, be-

cause a non-null external force is required to maintain constant the mechanical linear momentum.

We show how one can avoid the divergence in the interaction linear electromagnetic momentum of

a system composed by an idealization often used in textbooks (an inﬁnite straight current) and a

point charge.

INTRODUCTION

The electromagnetic angular momentum of quasistatic systems has been discussed in

diﬀerent examples in well known textbooks [1, 2], as well as in a number of articles [3, 4, 5,

6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. However, the electromagnetic linear momentum

appearing in the same kind of systems has comparatively attracted less attention [17, 19,

20, 21, 22, 23], although it may be even more striking the ﬁrst time a student is faced with

it. Furthermore, with the exception of the rather trivial distribution in the example by

Casserberg [20] and the mathematically complex calculation in [17], in those articles only

the total electromagnetic linear momentum is computed by using its evolution equation or

the vector potential. The ﬁrst goal of this work is to provide some simple examples that

can be used in the classroom to compute the density of electromagnetic linear momentum,

as described by the Poynting vector. In our ﬁrst two examples, the total electromagnetic

momentum can be computed both by integrating that density and directly by using the

vector potential.

In Poynting’s theorem one is forced to assume the electromagnetic ﬁeld carries linear

momentum in order to get the right balance equation for the total linear momentum. This

can be illustrated in the particular but simpliﬁed context of our examples. In all of them

the internal electromagnetic forces will not satisfy the action-reaction principle, so that to

maintain constant the total mechanical momentum one has to apply a non-null external

force on the system. Then, the only way to keep the balance equation (the total external

force equals the derivative of the total linear momentum) is to attribute a linear momentum

to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In our examples this balance can be simply checked and one

may see how the electromagnetic momentum is stored in the ﬁeld while the system evolves

starting from a conﬁguration in which some of its elements are separated at inﬁnite distance

and thus with no electromagnetic momentum. All this may help students to gain conﬁdence

on their understanding of the meaning of the Poynting vector.

In Section II we review some properties of the kind of quasistatic electromagnetic systems

we will consider. Then, in Sections III and IV we discuss two simple systems in which one

can easily compute the Poynting vector due to the electric ﬁeld of a point charge moving

at constant small velocity and a stationary magnetic ﬁeld. We explicitly check the balance

equation of the total linear momentum and also that it may be computed by using either

2

the vector potential or the Poynting vector. We show that the latter method, although more

diﬃcult in general, has the advantage of showing the spatial distribution of momentum den-

sity; in fact, it uncovers a curious fact about that distribution in the example of Section IV.

The total electromagnetic linear momentum of the ﬁrst model for the system studied in that

section is inﬁnite. This divergence illustrates the limitations of an idealization often used in

textbooks (an inﬁnite straight current) and can be avoided in several ways, one of which is

presented in the same section. In Section V we analyze another model which can be used

to illustrate the relationship between the violation of the action-reaction principle and the

origin of the electromagnetic momentum, as well as the origin of the divergence in the ﬁrst

model of Section IV. We also discuss the energy balance in all the examples.

II. STATIONARY CURRENT AND POINT CHARGE

Let us consider an electromagnetic system formed by a static magnetic ﬁeld BI created

by a stationary current I as well as the electric ﬁeld Eq and the magnetic ﬁeld Bq created

by a point charge q moving with a small constant velocity (which may be null). In the total

electromagnetic energy there will be a constant magnetic energy associated to the density
B2
the energy density (ǫ0E2

I /2µ0. On the other hand, since the point charge, its ﬁelds and the self-contributions to
Bq) move

q /2µ0) and to the linear momentum density (ǫ0 Eq ×

q /2+B2

as a whole, the associated electromagnetic energy and linear momentum are also constant

(and inﬁnite, so that they must be dealt with by means of some appropriate renormalization

procedure).

But from now on we will forget about all these constant self-contributions and consider
only the interaction energy and linear momentum densities given by the cross terms Bq ·
BI/µ0 and ǫ0 Eq ×

BI, respectively.

The total interaction energy is then [24]

U = q ˙rq ·

A (rq) ,

(1)

where the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge for BI =

A is evaluated at the charge

∇ ×

position rq.

Under the assumption of small constant velocity, the total interaction linear momentum

can be computed by using the result proved by Calkin [19] (see also [25]) for more general

3

quasistatic systems, which reduces in our case to

P = qA (rq) .

(2)

Calkin also proves in the more general context that the derivative of the electromagnetic

linear momentum equals the external force applied on the system to keep constant the

mechanical linear momentum. One of the goals of this work is to illustrate this kind of

result (as well as the general momentum balance [26]) with some particularly easy examples;

but we will compute not only the total linear momentum but also its density, to gain some

insight on its spatial distribution.

III. TOROIDAL SOLENOID AND POINT CHARGE

Our ﬁrst example is the system depicted in Figure 1: a point charge is moving with a

small constant velocity along the symmetry axis of a ﬁxed toroidal solenoid. Since our goal

is to illustrate in an example a general result, we will make a twofold approximation which

will allow discussing the physics with a minimal mathematical apparatus. First of all, we
R2,

will assume that the torus is very thin so that the area of the cross section is S

≪

R being solenoid’s main radius. With this assumption the magnetic ﬁeld created by the

current I is conﬁned inside the solenoid where its value, in the usual cylindrical coordinates,

is

BI =

µ0NI
2πR

ˆϕ,

assuming the solenoid has N turns. Furthermore, we will assume the point charge located at

rq = a k moves slowly, so that we will keep in all the calculations only the lowest order term

in an expansion in powers of β

˙a/c. In particular, we will check below that this allows

≡

ignoring the change of the current intensity on the solenoid due to the changing magnetic
ﬂux created by the charge, because the induced electromotive force is proportional to β2.

Moreover, this approximation reduces the exact expressions for its electric and magnetic

ﬁelds at a generic point of coordinates (ρ, ϕ, z), [27]

The dependence on β2 of the last expression explicitly shows that, in our approximation,

the solenoid. The power given to the solenoid is, then,

Since (in our low-velocity approximation) the solenoid creates no magnetic ﬁeld outside

the torus, the point charge feels no magnetic force: no external force is necessary to keep

its constant velocity. But, due to the magnetic ﬁeld created by the charge, the solenoid will

feel a magnetic force, so that an external force is necessary to keep it at rest. Since it is

applied on a ﬁxed solenoid, the external force performs no work. Furthermore, the kinetic

energy is constant. So, where does power (10) come from?

The answer is, of course, that the electromagnetic energy is not constant: it has a time-

dependent component due to the mixed electromagnetic ﬁeld, which can be computed by

using (1) or directly from the density of electromagnetic energy:

We can now see that the derivative ˙U is just the opposite of the power given to the solenoid

by the changing magnetic ﬁeld Bq, so that the conservation of the total energy holds:

B. Linear momentum balance

As mentioned above, the point charge feels no magnetic force and there is no external

force applied on it. However, we can easily check that the action-reaction principle is not

satisﬁed, for there is a magnetic force on the solenoid due to Bq.

Let us consider the current turns located between the angles ϕ and ϕ + dϕ. We may

think about them as an equivalent elementary turn of current

so that its magnetic dipole moment is

dm = dI S ˆϕ =

by summing up the energies of these elementary dipoles:

On the other hand, as a consequence of the magnetic ﬁeld created by the moving charge,

there is a force acting on the turn, which can be easily calculated:

Let us now assume that the particle came from inﬁnity with a small constant velocity

external force Fext =

We see that the linear momentum density has two components which vanish at inﬁnity.

The one along the symmetry axis OZ is always positive and decreases monotonically from

a = 0 to a

. The radial component has the sign of a and reaches its maximum

absolute value for a =

R/√2. By symmetry this radial component will give a total null

contribution to the linear momentum. In fact, the latter is easily computed, because in our

approximation the integral extended to the inside of the torus T reduces to an integral along

its central line C:

P =

G dV = SR

G dϕ =

ZT

IC

µ0qNIRS

3/2 k.

The physical picture is now clear: the electromagnetic linear momentum (21) stored

inside the solenoid is a direct consequence of the impulse of the external force Fext =

applied on the solenoid to keep it at rest.

If the particle came from inﬁnity (where the

electromagnetic linear momentum was null) with a small constant velocity ˙a < 0, the total

impulse of the external force equals the total electromagnetic momentum, because from (19)

and (21) we have

or, equivalently, Fext dt = ˙P.

Fext dt = P

Z

On the other hand, as a consequence of (14), the vector potential created at charge’s

location by the elementary turn (ϕ, ϕ + dϕ) is

It is remarkable that, from the point of view of result (2), the linear momentum inside

the elementary turn may be understood as created only by that turn, independently of the

remaining turns in the solenoid:

dP = G dV = GSR dϕ = q dA (rq) .

Of course the same is not true outside the torus, where the linear momentum density is zero

due to the sum of contributions by all turns.

We can now check directly that (2) gives (21), because from the (23) we ﬁnd the total

vector potential:

A (rq) =

dA (rq) =

µ0NIRS
4π (R2 + a2)

(25)

This direct method to compute the linear momentum is not easier than the calculation

involving the Poynting vector —unless (25) is computed (by checking it gives the corretct

BI, for instance) without calculating (23)—, which would give us no hint on the presence

of a radial density of linear momentum.

C. Angular momentum balance

Since the dipole moment (14) is parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld created by the charge, there

is no torque on the turn, dm

Bq = 0, which is consistent with the constant (null) value

of the angular momentum. In fact, the mechanical angular momentum —with respect to

the center of coordinates— is null and the density of electromagnetic angular momentum is

parallel to the solenoid,

IV. STRAIGHT CURRENT AND POINT CHARGE

(26)

(27)

Let us now consider a ﬁxed inﬁnite straight wire conducting a constant current I and

a point charge directly moving away (or towards) the wire along a perpendicular direction

with constant small velocity. If we choose cylindrical coordinates around the OZ axis of

Figure 2, the charge position is given by

rq = a i = a (cos ϕ ˆρ

sin ϕ ˆϕ) .

−

(28)

In the following we will neglect the wire radius and, as in the previous section, we will only

keep at each step the lowest order in β = ˙a/c, so that, at a generic point r = ρ ˆρ + z k, the

8

electric ﬁeld of the charge and the magnetic ﬁeld created by the current are, respectively,

A. External force

By symmetry the magnetic ﬁeld Bq created by the charge exerts no net force on the wire,

but, again, the action-reaction principle is violated because there is a magnetic force exerted

on the point charge by the magnetic ﬁeld BI, so that to keep constant the mechanical linear

momentum one has to apply on the point charge an external force opposite to the magnetic

one:

Fext =

q ˙rq ×
−

BI.

Thus, we need a changing electromagnetic linear momentum whose time derivative equals

the total external force (31) applied on the system.

B. Linear electromagnetic momentum

The cross term in the linear momentum density is easily computed from (29)–(30):

G = ǫ0 Eq ×

wire, where it is positive for z < 0 and negative for z > 0. This in turn explains why its

current lines are closed or go from a wire point with z < 0 to another wire point with z > 0.

Due to symmetry, the radial component of density (32) will vanish when integrated with

respect to z, so that the total electromagnetic linear momentum due to the interaction of

the electric ﬁeld of the point charge and the magnetic ﬁeld created by the current is

We have used here the result (A1), which shows a curious fact: there is no net contribution

to the electromagnetic linear momentum for ρ < a, i.e., inside the cylinder centered at the

current which goes through the charge. Although it is clear from (32) —and from Figure 3—

that this is only possible for ρ < a, because only there does the sign of Gz change when ϕ

varies, one might wonder whether this exact cancellation happens only in the low velocity

approximation we are using. The answer is that the same cancellation occurs when the

exact electric ﬁeld of the point charge is used. This can be easily checked, because the linear

momentum density in the relativistic case is

On the other hand, the contribution to the momentum (35) for ρ > a has a logarithmic

divergence, as one could expect from the slow decrease of the magnetic ﬁeld (30) at inﬁnity.

This is just a consequence of the well known limitation of the model we are using: an inﬁnite

straight current is a good approximation to compute ﬁelds near the wire, but it may lead

to meaningless results for far ﬁelds, which enter along with near ﬁelds in the total value of

the electromagnetic momentum. This limitation can be easily avoided if we consider that

the return current goes along a coaxial conducting cylinder of radius ρ = R > a, so that

it encloses both the wire and the particle. Then BI and the Poynting vector will vanish

outside the cylinder and instead of (35) we have the ﬁnite

This is the right evolution equation for the linear momentum: the net external force applied

So, if we were interested only in the total electromagnetic linear momentum we could have

used (40) for ρ = a in (2) to compute (38) more easily, but then we would have known

nothing about the curious distribution of its density.

In this example the magnetic force applied on the charge performs no work, so both the

mechanical and the electromagnetic energies are constant. In fact, it is easy to see that the
density of electromagnetic energy 1/µ0Bq ·

z and, in consequence, the total electromagnetic energy due to the interaction of Bq

BI is antisymmetric with respect to the reﬂection

and BI is zero, which is also a direct consequence of (1) because the charge velocity and the

vector potential are perpendicular.

By taking the limit R

in (38) we recover the divergence in (35), but the latter can

→ ∞

also be understood by considering another family of models that recovers in the appropriate

limit the one we have used at the beginning of this section.

V. CIRCUIT AND POINT CHARGE

In this section we will consider the circuit of Figure 4 and the point charge moving with

constant velocity along a symmetry axis. If we take the double limit L, d

we recover

→ ∞

the system of Section IV. By symmetry, the ﬂux of the magnetic ﬁeld created by the charge

across the circuit is null, so that there is no induction.

11

In this case also the action-reaction principle is violated, for the external forces that have

to be applied on the charge (to keep constant its velocity) and on the circuit (to keep it at

rest) are not opposite to each other. By symmetry, the magnetic force exerted on circuit

sides 1 and 3 vanish, while those applied on sides 2 and 4 are equal, so that the total magnetic

force on the circuit is

FI =

k,

(42)

as one can easily check. It is not diﬃcult to compute the magnetic ﬁeld created by each

circuit side on the point charge. The force exerted by the magnetic ﬁelds of arms 2 and 4

is just

FI, but there are also the forces due to the magnetic ﬁelds created by 1 and 4: the

In consequence, to keep at rest the circuit and constant the charge velocity, external forces

must be applied on both elements, so that although the mechanical linear momentum is

Again we need a changing electromagnetic linear momentum to have the right evolution for

the total linear momentum.

The electromagnetic linear momentum due to the interaction of ﬁelds created by circuit

and charge can be easily computed by using (2) and

On the other hand, from result (47) it is easy to understand the origin of the logarithmic

As in Section IV, the external forces perform no work and the charge velocity and the

vector potential are perpendicular, so that the total electromagnetic energy due to the

interaction of Bq and BI is zero.

Integral (A1) —as well as others appearing in the previous pages— can be computed by

using tables [28] or a computer algebra system, but both methods are far less helpful in

order to calculate (A2). In fact, the easiest way to prove results (A1) and (A2) is to consider

in the complex plane the ellipse C described by

z = (ρ cos ϕ

we have

which is equivalent to (A2) and reduces to (A1) for β = 0.

For students who do not know about complex integration, one might use an equivalent

but more pictorial method. By eliminating the parameter 0

ϕ < 2π, it is easy to check

that the equations

describe an ellipse with center at (

a, 0), horizontal major semi-axis of length ρ and eccen-

tricity β, as depicted in Figure 5. If we consider the polar coordinates (r, θ) of an ellipse

point P , the integral (A4) is just the full change of the polar angle θ in a complete counter-

It is not diﬃcult to convince oneself that ∆θ equals 2π if the origin is inside the ellipse (i.e.,

if ρ > a) and 0 otherwise.

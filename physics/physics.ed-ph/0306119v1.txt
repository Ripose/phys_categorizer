A comment on W. Greiner’s “Quantum Mechanics – An

Abstract

It is pointed out that in Greiner’s book, “Quantum Mechanics –An Intro-
duction,” there is a confusion between the wavelength spectral function and
the (angular) frequency spectral function in the derivation of the Wien’s dis-
placement law.

In his book, Quantum Mechanics – An Introduction [1], Greiner derives Wien’s displace-
ment law from Planck’s spectral energy density distribution. In his derivation, there is a
mistake due to a confusion between the wavelength spectral function and the (angular) fre-
quency spectral function. For convenience of discussion, here we quote the problem posed
and a part of the solution to it.

Problem. Derive Wien’s displacement law, i.e.,

λmaxT = const.

from Planck’s spectral energy density 1
where 1
Solution. We are looking for the maximum of the Planck’s spetral distribution:

V dE/dω achieves its maximum. Interpret the result.

Physically, these three spectral functions are related by the following equation:

u(λ, T )dλ = −ˆu(ν, T )dν = −˜u(ω, T )dω .

Let us deﬁne λM, νM, and ωM as the wavelength, frequency, and angular frequency at
which u(λ, T ), ˆu(ν, T ), and ˜u(ω, T ) have their maximum value. (At this stage, it is very
clear that the ‘ωmax’ in Eq. (3) is the same as ωM .) For λM, one must solve the following
transendental equation

with x = ch
with x = hν
follows:

kBλT . The equation to solve for νmax is the same as the one in Eq. (2), this time,
kBT . The solutions to Eqs. (2) and (7) (x1 and x2, respectively) are given as

If the ‘λmax’ in the underlined sentence (in the quoted problem) is deﬁned as in the boxed
equation above Eq. (4), in conformity with the following general relation:

λmaxT = 2.177 λM T = 0.629 cm K ,

(10)

which diﬀers from Eq. (4).

In conclusion, if the author of [1] insists that the ‘λmax’ in Eq. (4) be the wavelength
at which the wavelength spectral function u(λ, T ) achieves its maximum, in order to keep
the number 0.29 on the right-hand side of Eq. (4) as usual [2], then the wavelength spectral
function u(λ, T ) of Eq. (6), instead of the (angular) frequency spectral function, should be
used.

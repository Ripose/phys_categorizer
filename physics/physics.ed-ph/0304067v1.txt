boson attraction?

Physicists often claim that there is an eﬀective repulsion between fermions, implied by the Pauli

principle, and a corresponding eﬀective attraction between bosons. We examine the origins of such

exchange force ideas, the validity for them, and the areas where they are highly misleading. We

propose that future explanations of quantum statistics should avoid the idea of a eﬀective force

completely and replace it with more appropriate physical insights, some of which are suggested

here.

INTRODUCTION

The Pauli principle states that no two fermions can have the same quantum numbers.

The origin of this law is the required antisymmetry of the multi-fermion wavefunction. Most

physicists have heard or read a shorthand way of expressing the Pauli principle, which says

something analogous to fermions being “antisocial” and bosons “gregarious.” Quite often

this intuitive approach involves the statement that there is an eﬀective repulsion between

two fermions, sometimes called an “exchange force,” that keeps them spacially separated.

We inquire into the validity of this heuristic point of view and ﬁnd that the suggestion of

an eﬀective repulsion between fermions or an attraction between bosons is actually quite a

dangerous concept, especially for beginning students, since it often leads to an inaccurate

physical interpretation and sometimes to incorrect results. We argue that the eﬀective

interaction interpretation of the Pauli principle (or Bose principle) should almost always be

replaced by some alternate physical interpretation that better reveals the true physics.

Physics comes in two parts: the precise mathematical formulation of the laws, and the

conceptual interpretation of the mathematics. David Layzer says,1 “There is a peculiar

synergy between mathematics and ordinary language.. . . The two modes of discourse [words

and symbols] stimulate and reinforce one another. Without adequate verbal support, the

formulas and diagrams tend to lose their meaning; without formulas and diagrams, the words

and phrases refuse to take on new meanings.” Interpreting the meaning of wavefunction

symmetry or antisymmetry in a simple pedagogical representation is thus vitally important.

However, if those words actually convey the wrong meaning of the mathematics, they must

be replaced by more accurate words. We feel this is the situation with the heuristic “eﬀective

repulsion” for fermions or “eﬀective attraction” for bosons, or “exchange force” generally.

One can demonstrate there is no real force due to Fermi/Bose symmetries by examining

a time-dependent wave packet for two noninteracting spinless fermions. Consider the an-

tisymmetric wave function for one-dimensional Gaussian wave packets, each satisfying the

Schr¨odinger equation, and moving towards each other:

ψ(x1, x2, t) = C

where x1 and x2 are the particle coordinates, f (x1, x2) = exp [imv(x1 −

x2)/¯h], C is a time-

dependent factor, and the packet width parameters α and β are unequal. In reality, each

single-particle packet will spread with time, but we assume that the spreading is negligible

over the short time that we consider the system. At t = 0 the α-packet is peaked at

−
and moving to the right with velocity v, while the β-packet is peaked at +a and traveling

a

to the left with the same velocity. Of course we cannot identify which particle is in which

packet since they are indistinguishable, and each has a probability of being in each packet.

At t = 0 the packets are assumed well separated with little overlap.

At t = a/v, the wave function becomes

ψ(x1, x2, t) = C

and the direct and exchange parts have maximal overlap. The wave function clearly vanishes

at x1 = x2 (as it does at all times). At the time t = 2a/v, the packets have passed through

one another and overlap very little again:

Now the α-packet is peaked at +a, but still moving to the right and the β-packet is peaked

at

−

since, after all, they represent free-particle wave functions. Describing this process in terms

of eﬀective forces would imply the presence of scattering and accelerations, which do not

occur here, and would be highly misleading.

Nonetheless, the concept of eﬀective fermion repulsion is evident in many texts, partic-

ularly in discussions of the behavior of an ideal fermion gas — a case we explore further

in section II. A common usage of the repulsion idea is in the interpretation of the second

virial coeﬃcient of an ideal gas. The ﬁrst correction to classical ideal gas pressure due just

to statistics is positive for spinless fermions and negative for spinless bosons. Heer2 (similar

to most other texts that treat the subject, including one authored by one of us3) says, “The

quantum correction that is introduced by statistics appears as an attractive potential for

BE [Bose-Einstein] statistics and as a repulsive potential for FD [Fermi-Dirac] statistics.”

Patria’s book4 carries the idea further, developing an actual mathematical formula for the

eﬀective interaction between fermions or between bosons! He says, “In the Bose case, the

potential is throughout attractive, thus giving rise to a ‘statistical attraction’ among bosons;

3

in the Fermi case, it is throughout repulsive, giving a ‘statistical repulsion’ among fermions.”

This interaction formula ﬁrst appeared in 1932 in an article by Unlenbeck and Gropper,6

who may well be the originators of the whole statistical interaction picture. We discuss this

formula in more detail in the next section.

Wannier5 is a bit stronger in his assessment of the quantum thermal distribution function

for fermions: “The particles exert a very strong inﬂuence on each other because a particle

occupying a state excludes the others from it. This is equivalent to a strong repulsive force

comparable to the strongest forces occurring in the problem.”

The modern physics book of Leighton7 omits the word “eﬀective” in discussing the so-

called fermion interaction: “As compared with the behavior of hypothetical but distinguish-

able particles, Bose particles exhibit an additional attraction for one another and tend to

be found near one another in space; Fermi particles, on the contrary, repel one another

and tend not to be found near one another in space.” The classic kinetic-theory handbook

by Herschfelder et al8 may set the record by using the terms “apparent repulsion” (and

“apparent attraction”) four times.

Griﬃths9 does an interesting calculation of the average distance between two particles at

positions x1 and x2 when one is in state ψa and the other in ψb, the two functions being

orthogonal and normalized. For distinguishable particles with wave function ψa(x1)ψb(x2),

the mean-square separation is

“The system behaves as though there were a ‘force of attraction’ between identical bosons,

pulling them closer together, and a ‘force of repulsion’ between identical fermions, pushing

them apart. We call it an exchange force, although it’s not really a force at all—no physical

agency is pushing on the particles; rather it is a purely a geometrical consequence of the

symmetrization requirement.” This wording shows more care than the works cited above

and is thus less likely to be misinterpreted. However, the term “force” has explicit meaning

for physicists. It implies a push or pull, along with its associated acceleration, deﬂection,

scattering, etc. Are these elements properly associated with the exchange force? If not, then

the term should be replaced with something carrying more accurate connotations.

Our intention is not to be critical of authors for using the words “repulsion” and “attrac-

tion” in describing the statistical eﬀects of wavefunction antisymmetry or symmetry. This

concept has been with physics since the early days of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, it

is important to examine the usefulness of this heuristic interpretation of the mathematics.

As Layzer has pointed out, no such interpretation can carry the whole weight of the rigorous

mathematical formulation; however, if a heuristic interpretation brings along the baggage of

subsequent misconceptions, then physicists must be more circumspect in its use.

For example, consider the following case where there is a complete breakdown of the

concept. Suppose two spinless fermions or bosons have a completely repulsive interparticle

potential and impinge on one another at energies low enough that there is only s-wave

scattering. As we show in Sec. III, if the scattering amplitude for distinguishable particles

is f , then the scattering amplitude for fermions vanishes identically, whereas for that for

bosons is 2f . In this case statistical symmetry has diminished the interaction for fermions—

not made it more repulsive–and it has enhanced the interaction for bosons—not made it less

repulsive.

Wherever the idea of an eﬀective force breaks down (as it does in our wave-packet de-

scription and in the s-wave scattering example), we need to replace this interpretation with

other heuristic interpretations that better represent the physics. This is our aim in each of

the examples we analyze below.

In Sec. II we examine more closely the physics that gives rise to the idea of an eﬀective

statistical interaction between quantum particles and will derive the Uhlenbeck-Gropper

formula for the interaction. Section III will take the opposite point of view, and ﬁnd cases

where the idea is highly misleading and indeed where the eﬀect is actually opposite the usual

implication. Sec. IV summarizes our conclusions.

II. EXAMPLES OF THE STATISTICAL INTERACTION

There are several places where the idea of a statistical interaction arises somewhat natu-

rally, and might seem to imply an eﬀective force. The virial correction to the pressure of an

ideal gas is most likely the origin of this idea of eﬀective interaction. The physics of white

dwarf stars is another classic example of “Fermi repulsion.” The diatomic hydrogen atom

is bound in the electron singlet state, while the triplet is unbound, which is often used as

an example of the eﬀective repulsion between like-spin electrons due to the Paul principle.

When two rare gas atoms approach one another there is a hard-core exponential repulsion

between the atoms, which is often explained by the electron statistical repulsion. On the

other hand when trapped bosons condense, they collapse to a smaller region in the center of

the trap; which gives the impression of an eﬀective boson statistical attraction. In each of

these cases we will show that relying on the intuitive idea of Pauli repulsion or Bose attrac-

tion may actually hinder understanding of the basic phenomena. Alternative explanations

are provided.

Virial expansion. A real gas has an equation of state that diﬀers from that of an ideal

classical gas. For high temperature T and low density n of the gas, the pressure P can be

P = nkBT (1 + nB(T )) ,

(7)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and B is known as the second virial coeﬃcient. This

equation gives the lowest terms of the so-called virial expansion, a series in powers of nλ3,

where λ is the thermal wavelength, given by λ =

h2/(2πmkBT ) for particles of mass m.

where U(r) is the real interatomic potential at separation r and β = 1/kBT. It is evident

from Eq. (9) that a completely repulsive potential leads to a positive B(T ) and a positive

contribution to the pressure, while an attractive one results in a negative contribution.

operator interchanging r1 and r2. The single-particle energy is ǫp = p2/2m. Changing the

momentum sums to integrals and carrying out the calculations leads us to the following

result depending on relative position r12 only:

G(r12) =

1 + ηe−2πr2

(cid:17)

The purely classical ideal gas result would correspond to η = 0 with no correlation between

particles. Fermions, on the other hand, have G small within a thermal wavelength, an

example of the spatial consequences of the Pauli principle. Bosons have G larger than the

classical value. This result is consistent with the Griﬃths’ calculation of

in Sec. I.

Spatial correlations in a classical gas are described by the two-particle distribution func-
tion given by Gcl(1, 2) = e−βU (r). Thus, a s in Ref. 6 and repeated in Ref. 4, we identify by

analogy an eﬀective statistical potential as

(cid:17)

This quantity is plotted in Fig. 1.

It is purely repulsive for fermions and attractive for

bosons.

If we put this back into the classical expression for the second virial coeﬃcient,

we get precisely the result quoted in Eq. (8). A repulsive potential excludes atoms from

approaching too closely and raises the pressure; fermions also have an “excluded volume” of

λ3 and an increase in pressure. This comparison seems to be the major impetus behind the

concept of “eﬀective force” as applied to Fermi statistics. Is the physics similar enough for

the analogy to be useful? Our opinion is that it is not very helpful, as we argue below.

In a classical gas the rms average momentum remains

p2 = √3mkBT even when there

are interactions. Pressure is force per unit area and the force comes from the impulse of an

q

atom striking the wall. The average force that a single particle exerts on the wall is, by the

impulse-momentum theorem, F = ∆p/∆t where ∆p is twice the average momentum and

∆t is the average time over which the force is exerted, which here is not the time of contact,

but rather the time for an atom to cross the width L of the container, that is, ∆t = mL/p.

When one makes the volume of an ideal classical gas smaller (at constant T ) p is unchanged,

but the transit time ∆t is diminished causing the pressure to increase. Analogously, when

a classical gas has repulsive interactions “turned on” with no change in the temperature or

p, the pressure rises because of a decreased average transit time: some molecules bounce oﬀ

others back to the wall they just left. But this is not what happens in the fermion case.

The idea that the correlation hole in the two-body density Eq. (11) gives rise to “bounces”

or deﬂections of fermions from one another is a misconception that arises from the idea of

a Pauli repulsion. When one compares Fermi gas dynamics to that of classical statistics,

what is altered is not the eﬀective L in the transit time, but rather the p in both ∆p and in

∆t. For a given value of T , the momentum distribution in an ideal Bose or Fermi gas diﬀers

from that in an ideal classical gas. The exact quantum second virial coeﬃcient is given by10

This result explains why the substitution of Ueﬀ into the classical equation gives the exact

answer. Nevertheless, it is not the spatial dependence of G that gives us physical insight;

it is the momentum dependence: Carry out the position integration indicated in Eq. (13)

The ﬁrst term of this is just the classical partition function and its contribution is already

accounted for in the classical ideal gas pressure; it cancels out in Eq. (13). The second

term corrects the wrong classical momentum distribution represented by the ﬁrst term. The

classical term includes double-occupation states; for fermions the second term cancels these

out. For bosons, the classical counting undercounts these double-occupation terms and the

second term corrects that fault as well. Writing the second virial coeﬃcient in momentum

space clariﬁes how the change in momentum distribution aﬀects the pressure. For bosons,

there is a lowering of the average momentum so the force on the wall is lessened. For

8

fermions, the momentum is raised increasing the pressure. The idea of an eﬀective repulsion

between fermions just ignores the real physics and gives a very poor analogy with classical

repulsive gases.

White dwarf stars and related objects. It is the fermion zero-point pressure that prevents

the collapse under gravitational forces of the white dwarf star. Krane11 says, “A white

dwarf star is prevented from collapse by the Pauli principle, which prevents the electron

wave functions from being squeezed too close together.. . . Will the repulsion of the electron

wave functions due to the Pauli principle be able to prevent the collapse of any star, no

matter how massive?” (This line leads into a discussion of neutron stars.) We feel this

qualitative picture of what goes on in a white dwarf star could, as with the second virial

coeﬃcient interpretation, be greatly improved by discussion in terms of the momentum-space

features of the Pauli principle. Most elementary discussions11 of white dwarfs incorporate a

discussion of “Fermi repulsion” by doing a dimensional analysis that equates the zero-point

energy of the ideal Fermi gas to the gravitational self-energy of the star matter. The Fermi

temperature is much greater than the physical temperature in the star so that the T = 0

fermion gas is used as a model.

An alternate physical description arises from considering the hydrostatic equilibrium

conditions of the star.12 The star is assumed to contain N nuclei (assumed all helium) in

radius R. A spherical shell of thickness dr at radius r has an outward force due to a diﬀerence

between the pressure P (r) on the inner surface and the pressure P (r + dr) = P + dP (with

dP < 0) on the outer surface, caused by the nonuniform nuclear number density of the

star, n(r). This net outward force 4πr2dP is balanced by the gravitational pull toward the

center due to the total mass M(r) enclosed by the shell. The mass of the shell itself is

4πr2n(r) dr mHe, where mHe is the helium mass, so that

dP =

GM(r)n(r) dr mHe

.

(15)

The crucial idea is that P is the pressure of a degenerate electron gas with the electron

density maintained by charge neutrality at twice the helium number density ne(r) = 2n(r).

For a non-relativistic model the Pauli pressure at T = 0 is given by standard statistical

tion for n(r) from these steps. We can do a simple dimensional analysis based on Eq. (15)

This is the usual non-relativistic result, which does not demonstrate the collapse at some

large M like the relativistic case, but gives the idea behind the stability of the star.

The gravitational attraction on a mass element is balanced by the diﬀerence in Pauli pres-

sure across the mass shell. In order to develop a qualitative argument for the strong density

dependence of the Pauli pressure that supports the star against gravitational collapse, we

can return to the argument used for the virial coeﬃcient. In a box of sides L, the pressure

is force per unit area A, or P = (N/A)∆p/∆t. But the average momentum per particle ∆p

imparted to the wall for a degenerate Fermi gas is of order pF, the Fermi momentum. The

transit time is ∆t

The Fermi momentum itself is strongly dependent on the density because of the necessity

to ﬁll the single-particle energy levels with two per momenum state. This requirement is

pF = ¯h(3π2ne)1/3. Note that pF is related to a deBroglie wavelength by

Thus the maximum wavelength is approximately the interparticle separation, which one can

argue is necessitated by the Pauli principle requiring that the electrons be in single-particle

wave packets compact enough that they don’t overlap. This is an argument about quantum-

mechanical wave-function correlation rather than an argument based on an eﬀective force.

The connection to the Pauli pressure is the high momentum that this correlation induces.

If by “preventing the wave functions from being squeezed too close together”11 one means

that the fermion wave function must have suﬃcient curvature for nodes to appear whenever

any two coordinates are equal, then the idea leads directly to the correct behavior. This

extra curvature requires higher Fourier components. The pressure diﬀers from one kind

of statistics to another directly because of diﬀering momentum distributions; the Fermi

distribution involves larger average momenta, giving it a Pauli pressure. The idea of “wave

function repulsion” as a correlation that leads to this momentum distribution might be

useful, although the word “repulsion” still carries the connotation of a force, which is less

useful.

The physical explanations of neutron stars,13 strange quark matter,14 the Thomas-Fermi

model of the atom,15 are all analogous to the white dwarf star in that the Pauli pressure of

a Fermi ﬂuid is the basis of resistance to compression.

The hydrogen molecule and interatomic forces. The singlet electron state of hydrogen

is bound while the triplet state is unbound. Is it a case of the Pauli repulsion giving the

spatially antisymmetric state associated with the triplet higher energy? Griﬃths,9 applying

the discussion of exchange forces to this problem, says “The system behaves as though

there were a ‘force of attraction’ between identical bosons, pulling them closer together.. . . If

electrons were bosons, the symmetrization requirement. . . would tend to concentrate the

electrons toward the middle, between the two protons. . . , and the resulting accumulation of

negative charge would attract the protons inward, accounting for the covalent bond.. . . But

wait. We have been ignoring spin.. . . ” He then talks of the fact that the entire spin and

space wave function must be antisymmetric and gets the proper bonding in the singlet state.

He shows that for the spatially antisymmetric triplet state “the concentration of negative

charge should actually be shifted to the wings. . . , tearing the molecule apart.”

While this explanation is very carefully worded and provides a very useful physical picture

of the hydrogen bond, a strikingly diﬀerent picture of covalent bonding and antibonding is

given by the work of Herring.16 Herring argues that the energy diﬀerence between singlet

and triplet states (in widely separated atoms at least) is properly interpreted as a splitting

between atomic levels due to tunneling. Consider the hypothetical case of two spinless,

distinguishable electrons in a hydrogen molecule. The Hamiltonian has the form

H = t1 + t2 + V (12) + U(1) + U(2),

(20)

in which ti is the kinetic energy operator for particle i, V (12) represents the particle-particle

interaction, and U(i) is an external double-well potential representing the attraction of the

ith electron to the two nuclei located, say, at Ra and Rb. The Hamiltonian is symmetric

under interchange of the two particles, so the eigenfunctions must be either symmetric or

11

antisymmetric, even for these distinguishable particles. Let ψ+ and ψ− represent the lowest

symmetric and antisymmetric eigenfunctions, respectively, with corresponding energies E+

and E−.

The combination

1
√2
is a function for which particle 1 is localized near site Ra,, and particle 2 near site Rb. If

φab(1, 2) =

(ψ+ + ψ−)

(21)

P12 is the permutation operator then the function P12 φab(1, 2) = φab(2, 1) = φba(1, 2) is

localized around the exchanged sites; that is, particle 1 is localized near site Rb, and particle

2 near site Ra. Herring calls the functions φab(1, 2) and φba(1, 2) “home-base functions.” If

one sets the initial conditions such that the particles are in φab(1, 2), then the two particles

will tunnel through the double-well barrier between φab(1, 2) and φba(1, 2) with frequency
ω = (E+ −

J,

(22)

where E0 = (E+ + E−)/2 and J = (E+ −
nodeless state must be the ground state, thereby implying that J is negative. This energy

E−)/2. A theorem17 states that the symmetric

splitting occurs independent of any spin eﬀects.

If the two particles are spin-1/2 fermions, exactly the same physics holds, except now

the symmetric wave function ψ+ must be associated with an antisymmetric spin function

while ψ− must be associated with a symmetric spin function in order to keep the entire wave

function overall antisymmetric. The result is that Eq. (22) is replaced by

E± = E0 ±

Jσ1 ·

σ2,

(23)

where σi is a Pauli spin matrix. This operator expression acts in spin space to associate the

correct spin state (singlet or triplet) with the correct energy.18 Since the symmetric spatial

state is the ground state, as in the distinguishable particle case, the singlet state energy of

the electrons is lower than that of the triplet state.

Note that we are not at all criticizing the idea quoted from Ref. 9 that the lowering of

the energy in the spin singlet state can be associated with the concentration of the electron

cloud in the region between the two nuclei. However, the energy lowering would arise even

if the two particles were distinguishable; so it does not actually stem from their fermion

12

character.22 Of course, the fact that the corresponding spin state must be singlet is a fermion

property. The suggestion that Fermi statistics or Pauli repulsion plays a role in the lowering

of the singlet relative to the triplet state of H2 misses the essential fact that much of the

energy diﬀerence is due to splitting between tunneling states and that the tunneling ground

state must be nodeless and symmetric.

Let’s continue the above discussion, but with the hydrogen nuclei replaced with helium

nuclei. We can get an idea of the behaviour of the electronic energy for this pair of helium

atoms by using the same symmetric and antisymmetric wave functions. Because of the Pauli

principle, the two extra electrons would (in some approximation) be placed in the spatially

antisymmetric, antibonding, triplet state, thereby losing the tunneling energy advantage of

the symmetric state. This extra energy supplies a physical explanation for the repulsive

interatomic interaction when the closed-shell electron clouds start to overlap. Within the

Born-Oppenheimer approximation8,23 the electronic energy (plus the internuclear Coulomb

repulsion) is used as a potential energy for the atomic nuclei. The short-ranged repulsive

part of this interaction potential between two rare-gas atoms is often described by a phe-

nomenological 1/r12 or exponential repulsion.8,24 Here then is a case of a real repulsion

arising; however, it is a repulsion between the nuclei—not the electrons.

While the Pauli principle is certainly vital in understanding molecular forces, the idea of

an eﬀective fermion statistical repulsion has never really entered the picture. Indeed, we feel

its introduction short-circuits the discussion and could cause one to miss the basic physics.

Bose-Einstein condensation. Condensation of bosons into a harmonic trap might seem

the best example of boson eﬀective attraction.25 The condensate in a trap is a noticably

smaller object than the cloud of non-condensed atoms surrounding it. Of course, the real

reason for this is that the ground state in the trap of the interacting bosons has smaller

radius than that of the excited states. The particles are correlated to be in the same state;

in this case it is a spatially more compact one.

One of the present authors has also used the following argument3 to explain the fact that

the lowest excited mode in a Bose ﬂuid is a phonon rather than a single-particle motion:

“Bosons prefer to be in the same state with one another, so that if one atom is pushed on

by an external force, all the particles within a deBroglie wavelength λ (which is large at low

temperature) want to move in the same way. The collective motion of a sound wave allows

13

this while the single-particle motions are frozen out by this tendancy.” This argument seems

based on the idea of a kind of boson eﬀective attraction. A more rigorous argument is given
by Feynman.26 If Φ is the ground state of the Bose ﬂuid, then one might suppose that eik·r1Φ

is an excited state involving a single particle with momentum k. However the state has to be
i eik·riΦ, which is precisely the one-phonon
state. The particles “preferring to be in the same state” is a verbal expression to represent

symmetric, so this state must be replaced by

P

wave-function symmetry. Superﬂuids can be described by a “wave function” (order parame-

ter), which depends on a single position variable, has a magnitude and phase, and represents

the superﬂuid distribution. It costs energy to make this function nonuniform, as when a

vortex is present. The system “prefers” to have the same phase and amplitude throughout,

a property sometimes called “coherence.” Any idea of an eﬀective boson attraction is better

replaced by this latter concept.

III. WHERE THE IDEA OF A STATISTICAL INTERACTION FAILS

We have already argued above that the idea of a statistical fermion repulsion or boson

attraction has the potential to make one miss the essential physics of the physical eﬀect

being explained. Worse however, is the fact that this idea might cause misconceptions and

lead to incorrect conclusions. We present here some cases where that might occur.

The other spin state. Most of the textbooks quoted in Sec. I say unequivocally that

fermions repel and bosons attract without the qualiﬁcation of, say, the term “spinless.”

These books have ignored, at some pedagogic risk, the eﬀects of spin, which is usually taken

into account only later. The eﬀective repulsion or attraction (if there were one) is an eﬀect

of the spatial part of the wave function only. If the total spin state is symmetric, the space

wave function is antisymmetric for fermions and symmetric for bosons, leading to the eﬀects

envisioned in most textbooks. However, when the total spin state is antisymmetric (as for

two spin 1/2 particles in a spin singlet, or for two spin 1 particles in the S = 1, ms = 0 state)

the roles of fermions and bosons are reversed. Two spin 1/2 fermions in the spin singlet

state behave like two spinless bosons, and two spin 1 bosons in the S = 1, ms = 0 state

behave like spinless fermions.

Scattering theory. When two particles scatter elastically via a repulsive force the idea of

14

an additional eﬀective interaction due to Fermi or Bose symmetry can lead to trouble. In the

center-of-mass frame the two particles approach from opposite directions and scatter into

opposite directions as shown in Fig. 2a. If the particles are distinguishable, the probability

of detecting particle p1 in detector D1 and particle p2 in detector D2 is given by

(24)

(25)

(26)

where f (θ) is the scattering amplitude27. Similarly, the probability of detecting particle p2

in detector D1 and particle p1 in D2 (as in Figure 2b) is given by

P (p1 in D1) =

f (θ)

2,

|

|

P (p1 in D2) =

f (π

θ)

2.

|

−

|

When you don’t care which particle goes to which detector, but just want to measure the

cross section for either particle in a detector, the probability for a particle in detector D1 is

P (p1 or in D1) =

f (θ)

2 +

f (π

|

|

θ)

2.

|

−

|

Since the particles are in principle distinguishable there is no interference between ampli-

tudes, even if the detectors themselves do not identify the diﬀerence between particles.

Now suppose the two particles are indistinguishable.

In this case the two amplitudes

corresponding to Figs. 2a and 2b interfere, and must be combined before squaring.

If

the particles are identical fermions, the two-particle wave function is antisymmetric with

respect to particle exchange. Since diagrams 2a and 2b are related by the exchange of the

two particles in the ﬁnal state, they contribute to the total amplitude with opposite signs.

Thus, the probability to detect a fermion in detector D1 is

PFermi(p in D1) =

f (θ)

f (π

|

−

θ)

2.

|

−

(27)

This is obviously diﬀerent from the distinguishable case above. The diﬀerence is especially

remarkable at θ = π/2, where the fermion scattering probability vanishes. Moreover, in the

limit of s-wave scattering, which is a good approximation for some low energy cases, the

scattering is independent of the angle θ and the fermion probability for scattering is zero for

all angles. A similar argument holds for bosons, but with the amplitudes adding instead of

subtracting, leading to the scattering probability:

PBose(p in D1) =

f (θ) + f (π

θ)

2.

|

−

(28)

|

15

In this case, the scattering probability at θ = π/2 is twice the value for distinguishable

particles. For s-wave scattering PBose is a factor of two times the distinguishable value at all

angles.

The interpretation of these results in the context of an eﬀective fermion repulsion or

an eﬀective boson attraction is quite confusing. For scattering at 90 degrees, or for s-wave

scattering at all angles, it looks as if the total repulsive force is reduced in the case of fermions

(leading to a smaller scattering probability) and enhanced in the case of bosons (leading to a

larger scattering probability). This is exactly backwards from the notion that the scattering

force should be supplemented by an eﬀective repulsion for fermions and partially canceled

by an eﬀective attraction for bosons. It clearly demonstrates why the idea of an eﬀective

repulsion or attraction is a dangerous concept.

Focusing on the direct eﬀects of the Bose or Fermi symmetry leads to a more useful con-

ceptual approach to scattering. For two identical particles, the total spin state is symmetric.

For fermions having a total spin state that is symmetric (either both spins up or both spins

down), the space wave function itself must be antisymmetric as written in Eq. (5). For

this wave function, the amplitude for the two fermions to be in the same place (r1 = r2)

is obviously zero. As noted in Sec. I, two identical fermions are on average farther apart

than two distinguishable particles would be under the same circumstances. Consequently,

the fermions interact less and are less likely to scatter. One can similarly argue that bosons

are closer together on average, interact more and are more likely to scatter.

This conclusion is true whether the scattering force is repulsive or attractive, but it

depends critically on the spin state of the two particles. For identical particles the spin state

is necessarily symmetric, forcing the fermion spatial wave function to be antisymmetric or the

boson wave function to be symmetric. However, if the two particles are in an antisymmetric

spin state, e.g., two fermions in a spin-zero state, the conditions are reversed.

As a speciﬁc example of repulsive scattering, consider the quantum electrodynamic in-

teraction of two electrons (Moller scattering). In QED, there are two lowest-order Feynman

diagrams that contribute to the scattering amplitude with opposite signs, corresponding to

the direct and exchange diagrams of Figure 2. In the non-relativistic limit, the electron spins

do not change as a result of the interaction. (This is due to the fact that the low energy

interaction occurs primarily via an electric ﬁeld.) There is then only one ﬁnal spin state to

consider when doing the calculation. If the initial state has both particles with spin up then

16

(29)

(30)

the ﬁnal state also has both spins up. This case is treated in introductory particle-physics

texts28 and the cross section for scattering is

where α is the ﬁne structure constant and p is momentum of the electrons in the center-of-

mass frame. One notes that the cross section at θ = π/2 vanishes, as it should.

To explore the case of an antisymmetric spin wave function, one can also calculate the

scattering cross section for electrons in a spin-zero state:

This diﬀers from the identical spin case in the relative sign of the two terms.

These results should be compared to what the cross section would be if the two electrons

were distinguishable.

In that case, only the direct diagram of contributes, and the cross

section for scattering with both spins up turns out to be the same as the spin-averaged cross

section for electron-muon scattering found in many texts, with the muon mass set equal to

the electron mass. After symmetrizing around θ = π/2 to account for detectors that are

sensitive to either particle, the cross section can be written as

dσ

(distinguishable electrons) =

.

All three cases are plotted as a function of scattering angle in Fig. 3a. All cross sections

are symmetric around π/2, so only the range 0 to π/2 is plotted. As expected, the symmetric

spin case gives the smallest scattering cross section, the antisymmetric spin case gives the

largest cross section, and the case of distinguishable particles is in between. Moreover, as

Fig. 3b shows, the ratios of the cross sections change as a function of scattering angle. At

small scattering angles, the fermion cross sections are almost the same as the distinguishable

particle cross section. The maximum diﬀerence occurs at θ = π/2. It is diﬃcult for any kind

of eﬀective fermion interaction to capture this eﬀect, and moreover, the idea of an eﬀective

Fermi repulsion gives the wrong sign in the case of a repulsive scattering force.

Transport theory. Consider the example of thermal conductivity in a polarized fermion

gas. One might think from the idea of Pauli repulsion that increasing polarization would

shorten the particle’s mean-free path in the gas, which in turn would lower the thermal con-

ductivity κ. The opposite behavior is more likely to happen. At suﬃciently low temperature

17

where s-wave scattering predominates, polarization will actually cause a dramatic increase

in κ, because, as we have just seen, the s-wave scattering cross section between like-spin

fermions vanishes and only scattering between unlike spins, which now happens less often,

can contribute to the mean free path.

We treat a gas obeying Boltzmann statistics, but having full quantum-mechanical col-

lisions. For this to be true, the deBroglie wavelength must be larger than the scattering

length, but smaller than the average separation between particles.

If the temperature is

low enough s-wave scattering will predominate. This situation can occur, for example, in

trapped Fermi or Bose gases. The heat current for spin species µ in temperature gradient

dT /dz is given by arguments analogous to those for an unpolarized gas29:

Jµ =

nµvlµkB

−

dT

,

where nµ is the density of µ spins, v is the average velocity of either spin species, lµ is the

mean free path of a µ spin and kB, the Boltzmann constant, is the speciﬁc heat per molecule.

In Eq. (32) µ is + for up spins and

for down spins; there is a separate heat equation for

−

each spin species. We have dropped any constant factors in the expression. When s-wave

scattering dominates, up spins can interact only with down spins and not with each other,

and vice versa. Thus the mean free path is lµ = vτµ where τµ is the inverse of the scattering

For high polarizations (n+/n−

transport coeﬃcients for polarized systems has been predicted theoretically30,31,32 and also

seen experimentally.33 A similar increase also occurs if the particles are degenerate. The

idea of a statistical repulsion is counterintuitive to this result.

Ferromagnetism. A very simple mean-ﬁeld picture of magnetic ﬂuids is provided by a

model in which the particles interact by s-wave scattering only.4 Thus again there is no

up-up or down-down interactions and the energy of the system of N+ up spins and N− down

spins is given by

E = E+ + E− + gN+N

,
−

(36)

where Eσ is the total kinetic energy of the σ spins, which is proportional to N 5/3

as in

σ

the ideal Fermi gas. The interaction parameter g measures the scattering energy between

up and down spins. Two up spins (or two down spins) do not “see” each other in this

model.

If g > 0, this model has three possible states.

If g is small, then the system

favors less kinetic energy by having N+ = N− = N/2. That is, one has antiferromagnetism.

However, if g is large enough, then either all the spins are up or all down to minimize the

potential energy; ferromagnetism results. The kinetic energy in this case is larger than it

would be if Nσ = N/2, but the potential energy is zero. The wave-function antisymmetry

between two like spins has made them invisible to one another and non-interacting, because

their minimum separation is greater than the range of the interaction. The idea of a Pauli

exchange force would lead one to assume a higher associated potential energy (as in Eq. (12)),

but what actually happens is that the kinetic energy is raised by having more like spins,

while at the same time statistics favors lowering the potential energy.

IV. DISCUSSION

Our goals in this paper have been to clarify the idea of the statistical eﬀects sometimes

referred to as “exchange forces”. We believe the term “force” used in this context may

mislead students (and even more advanced workers), who might misinterprete the geometri-

cal eﬀect being described. We have given several examples of instances where statistical or

exchange forces have been invoked to provide a conceptual explanation of the physics. We

have not introduced any new physics in these examples, but we have tried to show how a

teacher or writer might provide an alternative interpretation that avoids the exchange force

terminology and thereby arrives at a deeper heuristic understanding of the physics. Indeed

we identiﬁed several cases where the concept of an eﬀective statistical force could lead to

the opposite of the correct answer. When a concept has that potential, it is time to replace

it.

19

Our alternative heuristics have taken several forms. We like Griﬃths9 wording: “it is not

really a force at all. . . it is purely a geometric consequence of the symmetrization require-

ment.” For same-spin fermions, the requirement that the wave function vanish whenever two

particles are at the same position means that the wave function must have increased curva-

ture, which leads to an enhanced momentum distribution. Indeed in many cases, the real

statistical eﬀect corresponds to a change in kinetic energy (i. e., momentum distribution) as

in the explanation of the virial pressure or the white dwarf star, whereas a force picture leads

to a change in potential energy as in the Unlenbeck-Gropper potential of Eq. (12). Equally

helpfully, the geometrical interpretation leads directly to the changes in average particle

separation as compared to distinguishable particles, with same-spin fermions farther apart

on average, which nicely explains the scattering results where same-spin fermions have a

reduced interaction.

It is hard to underestimate the importance of the the conceptual element of physics.

Whole introductory courses have been constructed that leave out much of the mathematical

half and concentrate only on the so-called “conceptual” side of the subject.34 Moreover, we

emphasize to our students that they have not understood a theory until they can describe

the physics in simple conceptual terms. Given that emphasis, we oﬀer the following guiding

principle regarding statistical symmetries: “May the force be not with you.”

J in terms of a surface integral.16 This surface integral represents a particle current crossing a

hypersurface separating the two localized site arrangements (a, b) and (b, a).

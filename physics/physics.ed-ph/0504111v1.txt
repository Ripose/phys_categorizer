February 2, 2008

Abstract

A lengthy bibliography of books referring to special and/or general relativity is provided to give a back-

ground for discussions on the historical use of the concept of relativistic mass.

PACS numbers: 01.40.Gm, 03.30.+p

Introduction

The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a bibliographic base to the discussion of relativistic mass (RM).
In a separate paper [Intro1], arguments dissuading the use of the concept of a velocity dependent mass are put
forth and the need for such arguments is based on the continued widespread use of the concept. This article
provides a reference list to the speciﬁc works listed in the survey.

The 634 works are separated into categories as presented in [Intro1]: textbooks devoted to special and/or
general relativity; popularizations of relativity, physics, or modern physics; introductory and modern physics
textbooks; and a miscellany of other works. In certain sections, in addition to the categorization of the use of
RM, other facts of interest have been included. For example, in listing relativity texts the signature of the metric
(if appropriate) is given as well as whether naturalized units (c=1) are employed. Additional commentary on
several of the works is included here, most in relation to the use of RM. A summary of the number of works
employing relativistic mass and those that do not is given at the end, these numbers yielding the plots in [Intro1].
A brief comment about the manner in the classiﬁcation of these works is in order. Whether or not a work
employs relativistic mass is not always an objective choice. There are instances where an author may introduce
the concept and then rail against it, while others may not explicitly introduce it yet allude to its validity, and
in some small circumstances (found in introductory textbooks) make explicit contradictory statements. Thus in
several instances it has been the judgment of this author as to whether it is employed or not. Those instances
have, for the most part, been noted in the comments. The basis for judgment has been from the perspective of a
ﬁrst time learner; if the presentation leaves an impression that this concept is valid (regardless of its fashionability)
then it has been listed as having introduced the concept. Some may disagree with the decision on some of these
references and may be up for debate, however the vast majority or works take a clear-cut stance one way or the
other.

The works here provide an extensive, but not exhaustive, base to evaluate the use of the concept of relativistic
mass throughout the past century. This reference is a work in progress, it will be updated as new works are
published as well as other, older, works are examined. The most up-to-date version of the bibliography will be
made available on the internet[Intro4]. This bibliography will also be made available as both a spreadsheet and
in Bibtex format. Therein is listed works that have not been examined.

2 Textbooks Devoted to Special and/or General Relativity (SGR)

There are 100 books that have been examined within this category. They are separated into two sections, those
that do not employ RM and a second section listing those that do employ the concept. Of these works 63 introduce
RM and there is not observed any signiﬁcant historical trend away from or towards the concept. The number of
texts published that do not use the concept has remained relatively constant over the past 35 years.

In the comments that follow each reference the signature of the metric is given as well as whether naturalized
units (setting c = 1) are used. For the signature there are three possibilities; [W] are ones where the signature
is (+1, -1, -1 ,1); [E] where (-1, +1, +1, +1); and [M] which refers to Minkowski’s complex time coordinate (i.e.
ct → ict) found in some older texts (which leads to a metric of signature [E]). As for units; [N] refers to the use of
naturalized units and [S] refers to standard units where explicit reference to c = 3 × 108m/s is continually made.

2.1.1 Footnotes

• [SGRn31]

He uses the term ”rest mass” continually in the section on SR. We shies away from saying that mass increases
with speed but in the tensor chapter he does say it twice.

The problem here is that in using naturalized units, c = 1, energy appears to be exactly the same as mass,
E = m. This can be deceptive, see Okun’s article (“second argument”)[Intro6]. Uses terms interchangeably.

• [SGRy23], pg73:

“Most textbooks on relativity work with the relativistic energy E = mc2 and rest mass m rather than with
the relativistic mass, a velocity-dependent quantity, m(v) = γv. We shall do the same from here on to avoid
possible confusion. Mass means rest mass m, just as in Newton’s world.”

• [SGRy58], pg 169:

“Since m∗ depends on u through γ, it is customary to say that “mass depends on velocity.” But it must
be remembered that this m∗ is the relative mass; the proper mass does not depend on velocity, and the
“dependence on velocity” is introduced merely for the sake of obtaining formal agreement between the
equations of relativity and those of Newtonian mechanics.”

3 Popularizations of Relativity, Physics, or Science (PS)

Of the 105 works examined that present a popularized, pedagogically basic, introduction to relativity or the
concepts of modern physics, only 18 were found not to utilize RM. A vast majority rely on this concept and
the numbers have been growing. Since the publication of Stephen Hawking’s bestseller “A Brief History of
Time”[PSy43], the number of books published presenting advanced concepts of physics to the general public has
exploded (however there is recent evidence that this trend may be reversing[Intro5]).

More and more, prominent physicists have been lured into this lucrative market. In addition, non-physicists
ranging from experts in diﬀerent ﬁelds to science journalists to those with no credentials whatsoever have been
publishing in this vein. In fact, in the period 2000 to the present, in this category 40 books were examined and of
these exactly half were written by non-experts. The post-1999 works below list whether the author is an expert,
[P] (that is, has a Phd. in physics or astrophysics, publish original research, and/or is an instructor) or not, [NP].
As many of these non-expert writers rely upon older popularizations or upon conversations with experts, it is no
wonder why the number of works utilizing RM continues to grow.

3.2.1 PSy footnotes

• [PSy1] On page 82 invokes the ”Law of Conservation of Mass” (Lavoisier’s law) to derive relativstic mass

from an inelastic collision viewed in two frames. Derivation is on pg 83.

On page 84 ”We are in a sense placing rather too much emphasis on the concept of mass here. This is
understandable since it plays such a central role in classical mechanics. In relativity there are several ways
in which mass and inertia can be deﬁned. Our use of ’relativistic mass’...makes the law of conservation of
energy and mass equivalent statements. Once we have developed a proper relativistic concept of energy we
will be able to tackle dynamic problems simply by considering the conservation of energy and momentum
(and these too [sic] are closely related, as we shall see when we consider a spacetime representation in the
next chapter).

12

Page 161 end Now goes on and does it properly
“In section 2.12 we assumed a relativistic momentum of the form p = m(v)v and used this to look for an
expression for the relativistic mass m(v) such that the conservation laws for mass and energy would hold
in an interaction. The result was that m(v) = γm0 and p = γm0v (m0 is rest mass). The expression for
momentum is simply rest mass multiplied by γv which we now recognise as the ﬁrst three components of
the 4-velocity.”

• [PSy2] He says there is no diﬀerence in which way you look (rel mass or not). Explains that particle

physicists do not use RM.

Quote pg 36: “In this approach. M is termed the rest mass of the particle. This has the advantage of
explaining why Newtonian momentum is wrong – Newton did not know that mass was not constant.”

• [PSy17] Pg 139, an exceptionally misleading quote:

“The answer is no, you can’t get younger. But you can age more slowly than a friend (or twin) traveling at
a slower speed. On the other hand, you pay a price: You also might temporarily get more massive in the
process.”

• [PSy52] Quote from page 66:

“For example, Einstein could show that the mass of an object increased the faster it moved. (Its mass would
in fact become inﬁnite if you hit the speed of light - which is impossible, which proves the unattainability of
the speed of light.) This meant that the energy of motion was somehow being transformed into increasing
the mass of the object. Thus, matter and energy are interchangeable!”

• [PSy40] pg 52 (whole ﬁrst pp) (Also incorrect use of ”Einstein’s equation”)

From the viewpoint of the concepts we have emphasized in this chapter, Einstein’s equation gives us the
most concrete explanation for the central fact that nothing can travel faster than light speed. You may
have wondered, for instance, why we can’t take some object, a muon say, that an accelerator has boosted
up to 667 million miles per hour – 99.5 percent of light speed – and ”push it a bit harder,” getting it to
99.9 percent of light speed, and then ”really push it harder” impelling it to cross the light-speed barrier.
Einstein’s formula explains why such eﬀorts will never succeed. The faster something moves the more energy
it has and from Einstein’s formula we see that the more energy something has the more massive it becomes.
Muons traveling at 99.9 percent of light speed, for example, weigh a lot more than their stationary cousins.
In fact, they are about 22 times as heavy–literally. (The masses recorded in Table 1.1 are for particles at
rest.) But the more massive an object is, the harder it is to increase its speed. Pushing a child on a bicycle
is one thing, pushing a Mack truck is quote another. So, as a muon moves more quickly it gets ever more
diﬃcult to further increase its speed. At 99.999 percent of light speed the mass of a muon has increased
by a factor of 224; at 99.99999999 percent of light speed it has increased by a factor of more than 70,000.
Since the mass of the muon increases without limit as its speed approaches that of light, it would require a
push with an inﬁnite amount of energy to reach or to cross the light barrier. This, of course, is impossible
and hence absolutely nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.

• [PSy73] pg 212 (this comes after correctly describing spacetime via diagrams and KE leads to fundamental
limit. “Whether or not to speak of velocity-dependent mass is largely a matter of taste. Although it is
currently unfashionable to do so, Einstein did and we shall as well.” As discussed in [Intro1], this is a
factually inaccurate statement.

4 Miscellaneous Works (Misc)

Those 119 books that did not fall under any of the other categories have been lumped into a miscellaneous category.
Thus, a wide range of books are reported here. The general type of book is listed but subcategories have not been
tabulated. The general type of books are referred to as: OT, other textbooks; APT, advanced physics texts (not
SGRT); Phil, philosophical works, including those of a religious nature; Hist, historical accounts; REF, reference
books, such as encyclopedias and dictionary of physics; and SF, science ﬁction books.

Of these works only 14 did not introduce the concept of relativistic mass. However, this should not point to
the general disparity between the two categories as the survey conducted for this category was biased. A large
number of works were located through searches (web search engines and library catalogues) for relativistic mass.
Thus it can be noted that the number of works utilizing RM is growing but no ﬁrm conclusion can be made

13

about those that do not. It is far more diﬃcult to search for non-occurrences of a concept. In addition, the use of
internet search engines and online book stores have tended to return more modern books, thus the distribution
is weighted towards the current era. Thus this category, unlike the others reported here, should be taken with
a grain of salt, there are a large number utilizing it these days but the general historical trend requires more
research to be conclusive.

“The light beam, he now understood, travelled at its constant speed while matter became smaller and
heavier the farther he got from it, the more slowly time passed.

“The addition of the relativistic mass to the overall mass of Mercury produces a very small acceleration to
the orbital motion of the planet. ”

“beam of particles faster than ever before by using an alternating electric ﬁeld whose frequency could be
adjusted for relativistic mass changes.”

“Finally in a law like the relativistic mass law, m = m0/q1 − v2

nor a tendency statement, but a frame proposition expressing a “grammatical” rule for the use of “m”, the

Introductory Physics and Modern Physics Textbooks (IPT)

This category of these works is the most signiﬁcant reported here and more eﬀort has been made to classify each
textbook edition. In all 315 editions of textbooks have been examined with the general result that a majority
utilize RM (223 versus 92). However, as reported in [Intro1], the modern trend has been one of moving away
from this concept. This is hypothesized to result from scrutiny of the literature on physics education research in
writing introductory textbooks. Generally, one does not refer to this body of research when writing an advanced
text or popularization of physics. It is interesting to note that this trend creates a widening gap between the two
viewpoints, leading to signiﬁcant inconsistencies in what is put forth. I have found that students arriving into my
course on relativity have deep preconceptions of relativistic mass and often point to widely read popularizations

19

penned by some of the most prominent physicists today. To have them unlearn this concept requires signiﬁcant
convincing (and time) and presents a sizable obstacle to an understanding of the modern geometrical formulation
of relativity. Thus, those who introduce this concept as a fact of nature are doing a disservice to those that want
to go on to become practicing relativists.

5.1 Category A: Conceptual Introductory Physics Textbooks

The following are references that fall under the classiﬁcation of “conceptual” introductions to physics. This
corresponds to category A as designated by the College Board. A summary and historical trends is provided in
[Intro1] and will not be repeated here. There may be slight diﬀerences in the numbers as some works have been
reclassiﬁed.

The use of relativistic mass is given for each edition, as it sometimes changes during the history of a textbook.
[1999]. Those editions
Editions which utilize RM are denoted by bold years enclosed in square brackets, i.e.
that do not not emphasized and are enclosed in parenthesis, (1999). There are some editions that have not been
examined, these edition years are in italics, (1999). And lastly, a small number of editions give contradictory
statements on the status of relativistic mass, these are noted in the comments and listed as such, [1999*]. As
before, relevant quotes and comments are given at the end of the listing.

5.1.1 IPMa, footnotes

• [IMPa18] 2nd edition:

-pg 128 “The conclusion is that momentum conservation can only hold if a fast-moving body appears to have
more mass than a slow moving one.”

-pg 129 “At speeds approaching that of light, the body becomes more and more massive. Then the increase
in momentum involves a large change in mass and a small change in velocity.

This property of mass also assures us that Einstein’s requirement that nothing move faster than light will
never be violated by a material object. As a body approaches the speed of light, the application of a force
in the direction of motion will only make it more massive and not change its speed appreciably.”

• [IMPa18] 3rd edition:

-pg 1313 footnote “Some relativity texts reserve the term mass for rest mass alone and put the γ in the
deﬁnition of momentum. This is simply a semantic choice.”

• [IMPa9] Following is a quote from the 9th edition, previous editions had no such disclaimer.

“Classically, the particles behave as if their masses increase with speed. Einstein initially favored this
interpretation, and later changed his mind to keep mass a constant, a property of matter that is the same
in all frames of reference. So it is γ that changes with speed, not mass.”

5.3.1 IMPc footnotes

• [IMPc13]

-pg 15-1 pp 3 “For those who want to learn just enough about it so they can solve problems, that is all
there is to the theory of relativity – it just changes Newton’s laws by introducing a correction factor to the
mass.”

Also see 15-9, 15-10 and 11, 16-1, and 16-4

• [IMPc36] T.R. Sandin is now a contributing author (editions 10,11). As he is a vocal proponent of the use
of RM, it is not too surprising that its use creeps back in these later editions. Added sentence in 10th ed.
Introduces and say there are strong opinions on both sides.
“Also with relativistic mass, the famous equation E = mc2 can be applied to all types of energy, not just
most types.”

• [IMPc37] This popular textbook has changed its position twice on the matter. And in transition, contra-

dicting statements are made in the 3rd and 4th edition.

3rd edition

4th edition

Pg 1124: Relativistic mass is introduced and the explicit formula presented.

Pg 1128: “Finally, note that since the mass m of a particle is independent of its motion, m must have the
same value in all reference frames.”

Pg 1175: “Finally, note that since the mass m of a particle is independent of its motion, m must have the
same value in all reference frames.”

Pg 1177 “It follows that mass varies with speed (relative to the observer). We must therefore distinguish
between rest mass, m0, which is the mass measured by an observer at rest relative to the particle (and at
the same location), and the mass measured in real experiments.”

By 5th edition this later terminology is removed, (but still states that light has mass).

• [IMPc41] Page 201, there is a discussion of energy and mass wherein E0 = mc2 is used and continual
discussion of rest energy is used. Here a good statement of the relation between mass and energy is made.
“ According to Equation 7-7, a particle or system of mass m has “rest” energy mc2. This energy is intrinsic
to the particle.”

However, roughly 130 pages later, on page R-12, relativistic mass is introduced in relation to relativistic
momentum.

“Equation R-10 is sometimes written p = mrv, where mr is called the relativistic mass”... “Relativistic
mass and momentum are discussed further in Chapter 39.”

5.4.1 IMPd footnotes

• [IMPd3] In the latest, 6th, edition of this long running text the author expresses his dislike for the concept

of relativistic mass. It is interesting that it took so long for this view to be expressed in print.

• [IMPd15] States they are diﬀerent approaches and equally valid.

“In any case it is necessary to check the ﬁnal physical laws, no matter by what process they are arrived at,
against the actual properties exhibited by nature. By this criterion either of the above expressions for the
dynamical laws must be considered to be experimentally veriﬁed, but of course the criteria of simplicity and
aesthetics speak strongly for the 4-vector form.”

6 A Quick Summary

The historical trends on the above works are presented and discussed in [Intro1], they will not be repeated here.
However a quick summary of the use of RM in these works is provided in the following table. The results may
diﬀer slightly than in [Intro1] as some works have been reclassiﬁed (and more reﬁnement is still in order).

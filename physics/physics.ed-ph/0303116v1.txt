Abstract

The reality of neutrino oscillations has not really sunk in yet. The phenomenon presents us
with purely quantum mechanical eﬀects over macroscopic time and distance scales (milliseconds
and 1000s of km). In order to help with the pedagogical diﬃculties this poses, I attempt here to
present the physics in words and pictures rather than math. No disrespect is implied by the title;
I am merely borrowing a term used by a popular series of self-help books.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Within the last two years, neutrino oscillations, ﬁrst postulated in 1969, have become a reality.
The consequences for our view of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, are quite profound.
However, even for physicists, an understanding of the evidence for oscillations and their mecha-
nism can be elusive. This article aims to present the current state of our knowledge of neutrino
oscillations in as simple a way as possible. It is a result of preparing for my talk at the American
Association of Physicists winter meeting of 2003, and of teaching the 4th-year particle physics
course at UBC. A lot of verbiage common to the neutrino oscillation industry will be explained.
For brevity and simplicity I will only look at what is currently the most likely scenario for neutrino
masses and mixings; other possibilities are shamelessly ignored. The hope is that this treatment
will be accessible to physics teachers and other non-specialists. The reader is warned however
that this text is dense; most sentences contain some essential ingredient. My bibliography aims at
accessibility rather than rigour or completeness. I present one mathematical equation.

II. QUARKS AND LEPTONS

The fundamental constituents of matter as we know it come in pairs - “doublets” - of elementary
particles which are very similar to each other except that their charges diﬀer by one fundamental
unit. That unit is the magnitude of the charge on the electron, which is the same as that on
the proton. The ﬁrst hint that the universe is structured this way came when it was recognized
that atomic nuclei are formed of protons and neutrons, which are more-or-less identical particles
except that one has a charge of +1 and the other a charge of zero. We now understand these
particles in terms of their elementary constituents, the quarks. The proton has two “up”-quarks
(u, charge +2/3) and one “down”-quark (d, charge -1/3); the neutron has two downs and an up.
In addition to these light, stable quarks, there are two more doublets which have larger mass,
and are unstable, eventually decaying into ups and downs. These are called charm (c, +2/3) and
strange (s, -1/3), top (t, +2/3) and bottom (b, -1/3). The names have no meaning, except to keep
physicists all talking the same language. So we have three “generations” of quark “ﬂavours”, and
this arrangement has deep signiﬁcance for the structure of the universe. Too deep to go into here.

The link between the partners in the doublets is the weak-interaction, the fundamental force
which controls β-decay, and, as we shall see, solar fusion reactions. The weak-interaction allows a
d to turn into a u etc., where energy considerations permit. Signiﬁcantly, it allows a free neutron
(n) to (β-)decay into a proton (p) and an electron (e−, historically known as a β-ray).

n → p + e

Or, in terms of the quarks (with the spectators in parentheses):

−
u(ud) → d(ud) + e

+ ¯νe

(2)

We’ll get to the νe in a second. Suﬃce it to say that without neutron decay there would be no

free hydrogen in the universe, and we would probably not be around to worry about neutrinos.

These ﬂavour states (u, d, c, s, b, t) - we call them “eigenstates” - are not kept rigidly separate.
The states in which these quarks propagate are called “mass eigenstates”, which are each diﬀerent
mixtures of the ﬂavour eigenstates. The mass eigenstates propagate at diﬀerent speeds and so
the components get out of phase with each other. A quark born as one ﬂavour will soon start
looking like another. An s-quark travelling through space can turn into a d-quark. Likewise all
the right-hand partners can mix between the generations, and any particle made of 2nd or 3rd-
generation quarks can decay into a stable particle made of 1st-generation quarks. By convention
we push all the mixing into the right-hand partner; this is allowed because the weak-interaction
allows transformations between the left and right partners anyway.

So much for the structure of heavy particles (baryons), those which form much of our mass.
What about the light particles (leptons), starting with the electron? There are three charged
leptons - electron, muon and tau - and three associated very light chargeless neutrinos, clearly
separated by one unit of charge.

(e−, νe), (µ−, νµ), (τ −, ντ ).

Superﬁcially this organization looks very much like the quarks. However, for a long time the
neutrinos were thought to be massless (as no mass had been detected). In this case, no mixing is
possible, as all neutrinos will propagate at precisely the speed of light, and the mass eigenstates can
never get out of phase with each other. An electron neutrino born will never change its composition,
as all parts will move at the same speed, and so the neutrino can never be detected as any other
ﬂavour.

As it turns out, this is not the case.
Mixing of ﬂavours in the charged leptons would be easy to see. Muons would decay into electrons
and gamma-rays; this would be a fast electromagnetic decay in contrast to the slow weak decay
which actually happens.

The ﬁrst decay violates lepton ﬂavour and has never been seen. The second decay tortuously

conserves lepton number, and is the way all muons seem to decay.

III. EARLY INDICATIONS (1968-1992)

By the 1960s our understanding of the solar interior, and of low energy nuclear physics, had
reached such a stage that the Sun’s neutrino output could be predicted with some conﬁdence. In
broad terms, this picture remains unchanged to this day. For an excellent review of the subject

Neutrino energy (MeV)

FIG. 1: The solar neutrino spectrum, showing the contribution of the 8B and pp processes, and the thresholds
for the three detection mechanisms. The ﬁgure is reproduced by courtesy of the Particle Data Group. [2, 3]

in somewhat more mathematical detail the reader is directed to an article by K. Nakamura in the
Particle Data Book[1], which is available online.

The two most important reactions - both weak - yield the copious, low energy “pp” neutrinos,

and the more scarce high energy “8B” neutrinos (see ﬁg.1).

p + p → D + e+ + νe Eν = 0 − 0.420 MeV

8B → 24He + e+ + νe Eν = 0 − 14.6 MeV

(5)

(6)

The “D” is a deuteron, heavy hydrogen 2H. The pp-neutrinos are very hard to see, even by
neutrino standards, and can only be detected by radio-chemical means (see below). However their
ﬂux (about 1015 m−2s−1 at the Earth) is 10,000 times that of the 8B-neutrinos. (An MeV is a
million electron volts, a typical energy release for a single nuclear reaction.)

Now the experimental nuclear physicists took up the challenge to detect these elusive particles.

A. Neutrino Detection

The chargeless neutrino cannot be “seen” unless it is (a) absorbed on a nucleon and produces
a charged lepton, or (b) scatters on an electron. In both cases the reaction products may be seen
- always through their electromagnetic properties. There are two fundamental ways of detecting a
neutrino; either by scattering oﬀ a nucleon, or an electron.

1. Nucleons

Electron-type neutrinos can scatter oﬀ a neutron to produce a proton, and the other half of the

neutrino’s doublet, the electron. This is a charge-swapping “quasi-elastic” reaction.

(7)

This reaction is exothermic, as the chemists would have it, and so would be accessible to all
solar neutrinos. Unfortunately, free neutrons don’t live much longer than a quarter of an hour, and
so a macroscopic detector is hard to build. The reaction doesn’t work on protons (hydrogen would
be a convenient detector) because the charges cannot be made to match (it will for anti-neutrinos,
which can make positrons - e+).

The next best thing is to use neutrons in a nucleus. This is not easy as protons are usually
bound less tightly in a nucleus than are neutrons, and so their eﬀective mass increases and this
raises the energy threshold for the reaction, in most cases out of reach of solar neutrinos.
In
addition, the outgoing electron is usually too low in energy to see, and so one has to rely on a
detectable product nucleus. This means it has to be physically removable from the detector and
radioactive with a convenient-enough half-life (preferably days) to accumulate and to observe after
removal. In fact the reaction tends to make a nucleus which is too proton-rich, and these do tend
to decay by the slow process of atomic-electron capture, which produces detectable X-rays. The
basic decay process is the reverse of neutrino absorption and yields back the original nucleus:

In addition, the weakness of the weak interaction means we need 100s or 1000s of tonnes of
target material to get a good signal, so the substance has to be cheap, safe and puriﬁable of trace
radioactivity. Three nuclei have been used as detectors to date. The ﬁrst was chlorine-37, in the
form of borrowed cleaning ﬂuid, which has been used by Ray Davis[4] since the late ’60s:

−
e

+ p → νe + n

−
νe +37 Cl → e

+37 Ar

(8)

(9)

This method of detection is sensitive to most of the 8B spectrum and neutrinos from some
intermediate reactions. The radioactive argon, a noble gas, can be bubbled out of the chlorine
using helium. It decays by the capture of an atomic electron, a process which kicks out further
atomic (“Auger”) electrons which can be detected and counted.

−
e

+37 Ar → νe +37 Cl + Auger electrons

(10)

This was the ﬁrst successful detection method for solar neutrinos, and as a result, Davis shared

the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics[5].

The only detector successfully used to date which can see the pp-neutrinos is gallium-71. The
ﬁrst results were recorded by the Soviet-American Gallium Experiment SAGE[6], and the Italo-
German Gallex [7], in 1990.

−
νe +71 Ga → e

+71 Ge

(11)

It works like the chlorine reaction except that gallium is converted to radioactive germanium
eve. However, you can’t bubble germanium out of liquid gallium without ﬁrst converting it to a
gas. This has been done, but it requires more chemistry than you can shake a stick at. Wags call
the gallium-germanium-gallium sequence the “Alsace-Lorraine” process, but don’t tell this to an
undergraduate class unless you want rows of blank faces.

5

The third useful nucleus is deuterium, but in a diﬀerent way. The proton and neutron are
bound in deuterium so lightly that the electron is energetic enough to be visible. This is fortunate,
because the stable protons are not:

−
νe + D → p + p + e

(12)

The most convenient form of deuterium is heavy water (not cheap but at least available[8]), and
the fast electron emits Cherenkov radiation which can be readily detected. Cherenkov radiation is
the result of a charged particle travelling at faster than the local speed of light (in water = c/1.33)
which emits the electromagnetic equivalent of a supersonic boom, a conical pattern of blue and
UV photons. The ﬁrst such heavy water Cherenkov detector is the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory
(SNO)[9], and it started operating in 1999, a decade after the ﬁrst light water Cherenkov detector,
Kamiokande (see next section).

2. Electrons

Conceptually the simplest way to detect neutrinos is via elastic scattering oﬀ electrons, which
are plentiful in any material. One simply has to choose a cheap, safe, puriﬁable, transparent
medium so the Cherenkov light from neutrinos can be distinguished from the inevitable trace
radioactivity. Water works well. The masters of this technique are the Japanese Kamiokande
collaboration (and its successor, SuperKamiokande). Kamiokande announced the ﬁrst real-time,
directional detection of solar neutrinos in 1989[11]. It was for initiating this series of experiments
that Masatoshi Koshiba shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics[5]. The reaction is:

νe + e

−
− → νe + e

(13)

Undergraduates have complained to me that this is not a real reaction because the left hand side
is the same as the right (and get even more confused if I occasionally leave the + signs out). They
have obviously been made to sit through too many chemistry lectures. The left-hand electron is
stationary, while the right-hand one is recoiling from the neutrino and is moving close to the speed
of light, which makes it visible. The directionality comes from the fact that the recoil electron
tends to travel in line with the original neutrino. This method of detection is sensitive to the upper
end of the 8B spectrum.

There’s a slight but signiﬁcant complication here. Electron scattering also works for muon and

tau neutrinos, e.g.:

The cross-section (i.e. sensitivity) of this reaction is only 15% of that for electron neutrinos.

νµ + e

− → νµ + e

(14)

3. The Data

By 1990, the chlorine, light water, and gallium experiments (in that order), had all reported
seeing only a small fraction of the expected signal. The numbers are given below. Note that all
these experiments have to be done deep underground, to get away from cosmic rays which would
easily swamp the tiny neutrino signal on the surface.

6

• Gallium (0.2 MeV threshold) - 55%

• Chlorine (0.8 MeV threshold) - 34%

• Light Water (9 MeV threshold, later 5 MeV) - 48%

There were 10-20% errors in these numbers due to experimental and theoretical uncertainties,
but it was clear that none of these numbers was remotely consistent with 100%. By this time,
the solar astrophysicists were getting very conﬁdent of their ﬂux predictions, and so these deﬁcits
became known as the “Solar Neutrino Problem”. When physicists use the word “problem”, they
mean “funding opportunity”.

IV. PONTECORVO’S IDEA

All the above detection reactions are sensitive only to νe (with the one exception noted). In
1969 Bruno Pontecorvo reasoned that if neutrinos had small and diﬀerent masses, plus ﬂavour
mixing, then νes born in the Sun might reach Earth as, say νµ (ντ s were not known then) and be
undetectable[10]. This might be the answer to the emerging Solar Neutrino Problem.

For simplicity, consider two neutrino species. Neutrinos are born and detected via the weak
interaction as “ﬂavour eigenstates”, e.g. e and µ . However they propagate as “mass eigenstates”
which have a distinct velocity, labelled, for example, “1” and “2”

If ﬂavour is not rigorously conserved (there is no particular reason why it should be, except
that’s the way the charged leptons seem to behave), and if the masses m1 and m2 are slightly
diﬀerent, these two pairs of states may not be one and the same, but may be mixed:

ν1 = νe cos θ + νµ sin θ

ν2 = νe sin θ + νµ cos θ

(15)

Our use of sines and cosines of an angle ensures that the mixing produces neither more or less
neutrinos than we started with. Its called a “unitary” transformation because the particle number
depends on the square of the amplitude terms shown (cos2 + sin2 is always 1 - Math 10). We will
deﬁne the phrase “slightly diﬀerent” later. Consider a neutrino which was created as an electron
neutrino. The probability that it will be detected as an electron neutrino a distance L away is
(after a bit of math):

Pee = Pµµ = 1 − sin2 2θ sin2 k∆m2L/E

(16)

Numerically, the constant k = 1.27 if ∆m2 = m2

1 is measured in eV2 (strictly eV/c2 all
squared, from E = mc2 - but we like to think c = 1), the energy E in MeV and the distance from
the source L in m. It will equally work for GeV and km. These are classical “vacuum oscillations”,
and they are plotted for the parameters we now associate with solar neutrinos in ﬁg.2.

2 − m2

With three species, the mass and ﬂavour basis states are linked via a 3 × 3 matrix with two
mass splittings, three angles like θ and an extra one which makes life diﬀerent for neutrinos and
antineutrinos (a “CP-violating phase”).

V. THE HARD EVIDENCE, 1992-2002

FIG. 2: The probability Pee is plotted against the distance between the source and detection for two

detected solar neutrino energy). Both have the currently accepted solar oscillation parameters of ∆m2
S =
6 × 10−5 and θ = π/6. It is clear that a reactor experiment, with a neutrino spectrum several MeV wide,
will see no eﬀect below 10 km, but at further than 100 km will see about 60% of the unoscillated ﬂux.

• the atmospheric muon-neutrino deﬁcit

• the solar electron-neutrino deﬁcit

The ﬁrst was formally announced by the Kamiokande collaboration in 1992 [12]. It was declared
to be proof of non-zero neutrino mass (consistent with oscillations) in 1998 by that collaboration’s
successor, SuperKamiokande [13]. Evidence for the latter had been building steadily over 30 years,
but proof came in 2001/2 by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory collaboration[14], who showed
that solar astrophysics could not be to blame for the deﬁcit, and that the “missing” neutrinos were
arriving at the Earth as other ﬂavour states. The particular oscillation mechanism suggested by the
solar experiments was conﬁrmed in December 2002 by the KamLAND reactor-neutrino detector,
a fact which removed any lingering worries about uncertainties due to solar astrophysics.

We will call the neutrino parameters revealed by atmospheric neutrinos ∆m2

A and θA, and those
revealed by solar (and reactor) neutrinos ∆m2
S and θS. The remaining angle (“θ13”) is now very
much sought after. The CP-violating phase is even hotter property but it will be very hard and
expensive to ﬁnd[15].

A. Atmospheric Neutrinos

Atmospheric neutrinos are made by pion and kaon decays resulting from cosmic-ray interactions
in the upper atmosphere. The numerology of these decays leads one to expect two νµs for each
νe (it is very hard experimentally to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos, (¯ν). The
following reaction sequence is typical:

p +14 N → π+ + X

π+ → µ+νµ

µ+ → e+νe ¯νµ

FIG. 3: The production mechanism and geometry for the detection of atmospheric neutrinos.

Cosmic Ray

Here X means nuclear fragments. However, the observed µ/e ratio is more like unity on average,
and is strongly dependent on zenith angle i.e. the distance the neutrino has travelled since birth
(ﬁg.3). It seems that the further a νµ travels in the Earth, the less chance it has of being detected,
even though the probability of absorption is tiny. In fact the mean free path of an atmospheric
neutrino in rock is about 1012 m, so only a tiny fraction interact in the Earth with its diameter of
only 107 m. Therefore they must be disappearing by some other means.

The measured ﬂux of νµs is about half the expected value, while that for the νes is about right.
There are strong indications from SuperKamiokande (SK) that the missing νµs are showing up as
ντ s (which are very hard to see). We will assume this is the case.

Detailed analysis in terms of path length through the Earth yields an L/E dependence as

expected from the eq.16, with parameters:

∆m2
A

≈ 3 × 10

−3 eV2

θA ≈ π/4

(18)

Atmospheric neutrinos are typically a few GeV in energy, so ∆m2

A is more-or-less ﬁxed by the
geometry of the earth, otherwise the eﬀect would be unobservable. The data sample is divided up
into two distinct angular regimes: the neutrinos are coming either from above, with path lengths of
10s of km, or from below, with path lengths of 1000s of km (ﬁg.3). Simple solid-angle considerations
tell us that not many neutrinos come from around the horizontal, with path lengths of 100s of km.
One reason why this evidence is so solid, despite the complexity of the particle interactions in the
atmosphere, is that we see no oscillation eﬀects above the horizontal, and plenty below it. The
only possible complications are those of Earth’s geometry and magnetic ﬁeld (which distorts the
isotropy of the cosmic rays), but these are now well understood.

Hence, oscillations like this will be visible for 1000 km pathlengths and 1 GeV neutrinos if ∆m2
A
is around 10−3 eV2, and the mixing angle is big, as can readily be seen from eq.16 and ﬁg.4. This
is precisely our conclusion.

FIG. 4: The probability Pµµ is plotted against the cosine of the zenith angle θ for the case of an atmospheric
neutrino experiment. Neutrinos coming from directly above have cos θ = +1, those from the nadir have
cos θ = −1. The energies plotted are 1 and 2 GeV (typical values in this case) with the accepted atmospheric
A = 3 × 10−3 and θA = π/4. It is easy to see that with an atmospheric neutrino
oscillation parameters of ∆m2
spectrum a few GeV wide, there will be no eﬀect on νµ ﬂux above the horizontal, but only 1/2 of the expected
νµ ﬂux will be seen below the horizontal.

The SK collaboration announced this result as the discovery of neutrino oscillations in 1998.
The big surprise is the largeness of the mixing angle, which may be maximal (45◦). The mixings
previously observed in the quark sector are very small (the biggest is 13◦). So, two of the mass
eigenstates (actually 1 and 3) are likely an equal mix of νµ and ντ , with very little νe in ν3.

The size of the neutrino source (a few km layer in the upper atmosphere) is small compared to
ﬂight distances (20 km -13,000 km), and νµ and ντ interact identically in the earth (i.e. no matter
eﬀects) so it is useful to think in terms of vacuum oscillations. Things are rather diﬀerent in the
solar case...

B. Solar Neutrinos

The ﬁnal piece of evidence for solar neutrino oscillations came in 2002 when the SNO collab-
oration reported two numbers, one for the ﬂux of electron neutrinos measured by reaction 5, and
one for the total ﬂux of all neutrinos ﬂavours measured by a reaction unique to deuterium, which
is totally blind to neutrino ﬂavour (x = e, µ, τ ):

νx + D → p + n + νx

(19)

Here the neutron is detected by capture on deuterium, which produces a visible gamma ray.
The analysis of this reaction in SNO’s data yields precisely the ﬂux of neutrinos expected from
standard solar astrophysics. However, comparison with events of the type shown in eq.5 show that
only 34% of these neutrinos still have electron ﬂavour by the time they reach us. The remaining
66% are in all likelihood an equal mix of νµ and ντ , if the atmospheric interpretation is correct.

10

It should also be noted that there is some evidence that the electron fraction increases at night,
when the neutrinos have passed through 1000s of km of the Earth to get to the detector.

In retrospect, the relatively large signal in the light water detectors was a good clue: some of
this is due to νµ and ντ . Once this is taken into account, the exact fraction observed varies only
slightly with energy. The SNO and SK observatories see no distortion; only the ultra-low threshold
gallium experiments see a slightly larger fraction. This is not what you would expect from vacuum
oscillations, which have a strong energy dependence. However, another process is at play, known
as the “Large Mixing Angle MSW” or LMA solution which relies on the behaviour of neutrinos in
the dense interior of the Sun.

1. Neutrinos in Dense Matter

The “MSW” eﬀect refers to three theorists Mikheyev, Smirnov and Wolfenstein who ﬁrst ex-
plained how neutrino mixing would be aﬀected in the presence of dense matter - the solar core for
example, or perhaps the interior of the Earth. Because ordinary matter contains electrons, and not
µ or τ , νe behave in a subtly diﬀerent manner in matter than do νµ or ντ . This distorts the masses
and ﬂavour components of the mass eigenstates when neutrinos move between a vacuum and dense
matter. The region of parameter space in which these eﬀects are important is shown in ﬁg.5. It is
fairly narrowly deﬁned in terms of ∆m2. If ∆m2 is too big, then matter eﬀects become negligibly
small - the critical value is ﬁxed by fundamental physics and the density of the solar core to be
around 10−4 eV2. If ∆m2 is too small, then the vacuum oscillation length becomes much bigger
than the solar core and so this region of dense matter starts to look too small, from the neutrino’s
perspective, to have an eﬀect.

On ﬁg.5 is marked what looked like plausible solutions to the solar neutrino problem in 1987,
when the idea of matter eﬀects arose. The small mixing angle “SMA” solution was the theoretical
favourite, as small mixing angles were what we were used to from the behaviour quarks. However,
this and the vacuum solution (“VAC”) produced strong spectral distortions which we just don’t
see. The LMA solution reduces the νe ﬂux evenly across the spectrum, and by 2002 it had emerged
as the likely truth.

A detailed analysis yields the following oscillation result:

∆m2
S

≈ 6 × 10

−5eV2

θS ≈ π/6

(20)

You can now see that the vacuum oscillation length is a few 100 km. This is small compared
with the 35,000 km radius of the solar core where these neutrinos are born. Thus vacuum os-
cillation eﬀects are totally washed out. So, for understanding solar neutrinos: THINK MASS
EIGENSTATES!

The ﬂavour composition of mass eigenstates in the LMA scenario is shown in ﬁg.6. The simplest
mathematical expression for the composition of neutrino mass eigenstates in a vacuum, consistent
with the data, is as follows[16]:

FIG. 5: Various solutions to the solar neutrino which were popular prior to SNO’s 2002 papers, plotted
in ∆m2 − θ space. The vacuum (VAC), “low” (LOW) and small mixing angle (SMA) solutions are now
thought much less likely than the large mixing angle (LMA) solution. The region where matter eﬀects come
into play is shown, as is the solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem, for comparison.

Whether this scenario is approximately or exactly correct is one of the biggest questions in
neutrino physics at present. Evidence, or lack thereof, for a νe component in ν3 is crucial, as noted
above. To understand how we come to this result one has to backtrack the neutrinos from a vacuum,
into the heart of the Sun. As the rising density starts to single out the νe as “special”, nearly all the
electron ﬂavour is piled into ν2, whose eﬀective mass rises because of the preferential interaction
between νe and electrons. This is shown in ﬁg.7. The eﬀect is somewhat energy dependent, but
above a neutrino energy of 5 MeV, the νe component of ν2 has risen from a vacuum value of 25%
to > 99%. For a lightly mathematical account of how this arises, see ref.[17].

Hence when a νe is born in a fusion or decay reaction, it becomes mostly ν2, with a bit of ν1,
and possibly a tiny bit of ν3. These mass states then proceed out of the Sun and on to the Earth.
In doing so, ν2 ends up a fairly equal mix of all ﬂavours, and that is basically what we measure
(along with possibly tiny contributions from ν1 and ν3).

There are hints in SNO’s data that the νe fraction in observed solar neutrinos is slightly higher
at night. The LMA scenario can easily explain this by allowing the ν2 to become a little more
electron-like after taking a good long run through the dense Earth at night.

A word of caution regarding ﬁg.7. The electron component of ν3 is not conﬁrmed and may
be very small. The mass scale assumes that m1 is zero, which may not be the case. In addition,
the smaller mass diﬀerence may be 2-3 rather than 1-2; we cannot tell as yet. In any case, these
mixings are fundamental, and the next challenge is to ﬁgure out why they are this way.

The solar results were conﬁrmed in December 2002 by the Japanese ultralong-baseline reactor
experiment KamLAND[18]. Here we have a point source, and it is therefore OK to revert to
thinking of vacuum oscillations. A look at ﬁg.2 shows why all previous reactor experiments with
shorter baselines saw no eﬀect, while KamLAND sees 60% of the unoscillated ﬂux at 180 km.
Note that the diﬃculty of these experiments increases rapidly with distance, because even without
oscillations, the inverse-square law is in eﬀect, and one rapidly ends up with no signal at all.

FIG. 7: A cartoon of the LMA solution for solar neutrino oscillation. Here is the big picture of solar
neutrino physics - including what we know about atmospheric neutrinos - in terms of mass eigenstates and
their ﬂavour components. Representing the ﬂavour components as ﬁxed fractions is only really useful here
because the oscillations are washed out due to the source size. I assume non-inverted hierarchy and m1 = 0.
At the moment there is no evidence for the electron component in ν3; shown here is roughly the maximum
possible value. The electron component of ν1 and the non-electron component of ν2 are likely very small. I
have also exaggerated the regeneration of νe in the earth; the eﬀect may be very tiny.

VI. BIG QUESTIONS

A. Why don’t charged electrons and muons oscillate?

Electrons, muons (and taus) are charged. The things that we know oscillate (K 0s, neutrinos) are
neutrals. We know two things about neutrals: we can deduce that they were made (by observing
other reaction products), and we can deduce that they died (by decay or absorption products).
What goes on in between is anyone’s guess (i.e. quantum mechanics). You can ﬁgure out that
you just made an electron neutrino, and somewhere down the beam pipe ﬁgure out that a muon
neutrino just interacted and died. The electron and muon neutrino do not have well deﬁned masses
(they are not mass eigenstates), but the mass splittings are tiny, so whatever oscillation occurs, we
never have to worry about mismatches in measured energies or momenta[19]. In between life and
death, however, they travel as mass eigenstates (ν1,2,3 )

Charged particles are diﬀerent, we can track them every mm of the way through a drift chamber.
Like Schr¨odinger’s cat, they interact too much with the environment to be in an ill-deﬁned state.
In addition the mass diﬀerences are huge (at least 100 MeV, a billion times the biggest neutrino
mass diﬀerence), so if you watch a muon suddenly become an electron for a few metres and then
revert to a muon, there would be major accounting diﬃculties on the energy/momentum front.
For muons and electrons, the mass eigenstates and ﬂavour eigenstates are (have to be?) one and
the same thing.

B. Why are the mixings so large?

We don’t know. A clue will come when we measure the electron component in ν3 at Japanese
Hadron Facility in the next decade[15]. This angle may be merely small, or tiny enough to be a
clue to some new physics. This will also tell us whether the νµ − ντ mixing is actually, or merely
approximately, maximal. This will tell us whether the angles are somehow randomly chosen or in
some way “special”.

C.

If neutrinos exit the Sun without interaction, how does the density of the solar core

aﬀect them at all?

This one is the hardest to explain to the man at the bus stop. Its all to do with amplitudes
and probabilities. Probabilities (of interaction, say) tend to be the squares of quantum mechanical
amplitudes. A solar neutrino can pass through a light year of lead with only a small chance of
interaction, so the probability here is tiny. But the amplitude (its square root) is not that small.
The way the electron density in the solar core aﬀects neutrinos depends, however, on amplitudes.
Hence is it possible to alter the neutrino states while the probability of interaction is negligibly
small. The characteristic distance required for this skewing of neutrino states is only about 100 km
in the core of the Sun, and a few 1000s of km in the Earth[20]. This is one reason why the day-night
asymmetry, if it can be measured at all, is very small. The Sun never dips too far below the horizon
even at the most southerly solar neutrino detector (SuperKamiokande, 36◦ N).

D. What are the absolute masses of the neutrinos?

We’re closing in on this question. We have the splittings, and they are plotted as a function of
m1 in ﬁg.8. The minimum value m3 can have is about 0.06 eV/c2. Observation of ripples in the

zero up to the absolute mass limit.

cosmic microwave background[21] and double-beta decay experiments[22] set the maximum to be
about 0.2 eV/c2. Another decade of hard work should close this gap.

E. What is the mass of an electron (or mu or tau) neutrino?

The νe doesn’t have a well-deﬁned mass; it is a thorough mix of two (or three) neutrinos states
which do have well-deﬁned, but diﬀerent masses. If evidence of a neutrino mass is seen in β-decay
spectra, it will be an averaged value (depending on the mixing angles) of these mass eigenstates.

F. Will we be able to see the decay µ → eγ?

No. By the tenets of the Uncertainty Principle one can, for a very short period of time, turn
a muon into a heavy W and a νµ (ﬁg.9). This νµ can in principle oscillate into a νe, which can
coalesce with the W into an electron. The γ-ray carries away the excess energy and momentum
and everyone is happy. However, Heisenberg tells us we can borrow 80 GeV for a W for only 10−26s
or so. But we already know that it takes 1000s of km for a 100 MeV (the muon’s mass) neutrino
to oscillate. That’s many milliseconds (an eternity) at the speed of light, so its never going to
happen.

VII. A MUSICAL ANALOGY

Consider two adjacent piano strings, tuned to very nearly the same pitch, (ω1, ω2) attached to
the sound board. Pluck or strike one string, and soon both strings will be oscillating with a mixture
of the two modes, one with the strings in phase, one with them in antiphase. The frequencies of
these modes are Ω+ and Ω−, as shown in ﬁg.10. The secret of the piano sound is that the Ω+

FIG. 9: Feynman diagram for µ → eγ. Imagine time running left to right. The heavy W + can link a muon
with a muon neutrino, or an electron with an electron neutrino, and also - because it is charged - shake oﬀ
a gamma ray. Hence if the neutrinos mix, so must the muon and electron. However, the big mass-energy
of the W + can only be borrowed for a brief 10−26s, too short for the leisurely neutrino oscillation to take
place.

mode couples very strongly to the sound board and makes a loud but rapidly decaying sound. The
Ω− mode couples only weakly to the sound board (the motion of one string negates the other) and
produces a soft but sustained sound[23].

This is a useful approximate analogy for neutrino vacuum oscillations. Each string can be
considered a ﬂavour eigenstate, but the time development goes on in terms of the Ω± modes.
Averaged over time, half the energy appears in each string, regardless of which string is struck.
However, the neutrino mixing is not 50-50 (at least not for solar neutrinos), and neutrinos do not

decay, as does a sounding string.

As an aside, this is a much more elegant analogy of the other signiﬁcant oscillation phenomenon
in particle physics, that of neutral kaons. These are made as ﬂavour eigenstates K 0 and ¯K 0, but
these are not mass eigenstates (just like neutrinos). Whichever one you make, it propagates as mix
(K 0 + ¯K 0 or K 0 − ¯K 0) of two states which have radically diﬀerent decay times (called “K-long”
and “K-short”). One can even, in the string analogy, regenerate the rapidly decaying component
by damping one string, in the same manner as one regenerates K-short particles by placing a thin
piece of material in the beam, thus preferentially “damping-out” the K 0s.

However, if one now considers a sound board to have a characteristic frequency ωB and two
identical string with frequency ωS, then one ﬁnds that the resonant frequencies of the whole system
Ω± behave as shown in ﬁg.11[24].

With no coupling one has two frequencies ωB and ωS. With coupling the same is true so long
as ωB is either much higher or much lower than ωS. The interesting part occurs when the two
frequencies are very similar, and this is an analogy with what happens when ν2 are born and travel
out from the solar core. At birth in the dense core, m2 is dictated by fundamental physics and
the electron density (i.e. the sound board frequency “ωB”). As it leaves the Sun, this state passes
through the resonance region and emerges as the higher of the two mass states (“Ω+”), the one
with 25% electron content.

Incidentally, the SMA solution involved a rapid (“non-adiabatic”) passage through the resonance
region which allowed a hop from the Ω+ to Ω− states, even with a tiny coupling. As we have seen,
however, nature did not go this route.

VIII. CONCLUSION

In neutrinos we are confronted by real particles which behave in a quantum mechanical fashion
over very large distances, 1000s of km. We are not used to this, and the physics community has
yet to assimilate fully the implications.

Abstract

This is a pedagogical paper which explains some ideas in cosmology at a level
accessible to undergraduate students. It does not use general relativity, but
uses the ideas of Newtonian cosmology worked out by Milne and McCrea.
The cosmological constant is also introduced within a Newtonian framework.
Following standard quantization procedures Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the
minisuperspace approximation is derived for empty and non-empty universes.

1 Introduction

Some of the modern ideas in cosmology can be explained without the need to
discuss general relativity [Landsberg and Evans (1977)]. The present paper
represents an attempt to do this based on Newtonian mechanics. There is
a need for pedagogical articles which discuss forefront ideas in research, but
also include all the relevant derivations in one place and at an accessible
level. This will be useful for instructors not familiar with cosmology but who
would nevertheless like a summary in a single article that can be used in,
say, a modern physics course. There are also some ideas presented here that
cannot be found in the pedagogical literature. These include a discussion of
how to incorporate the cosmological constant in Newtonian mechanics and a
discussion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for ﬂat, open and closed empty
and non-empty universes.

2 Equation of State

In what follows the equation of state for matter and radiation will be needed.
In particular an expression for the rate of change of density, ˙ρ, will be needed
dx
in terms of the density ρ and pressure p. (The deﬁnition ˙x
dt , where t is
time, is being used.) The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is

≡

d ¯U + dW = dQ

where ¯U is the internal energy, W is the work and Q is the heat transfer.
Ignoring any heat transfer and writing dW = F dr = pdV where F is the
force, r is the distance, p is the pressure and V is the volume, then

−
Assuming that ρ is a relativistic energy density means that the energy is
expressed as [Guth and Steinhardt (1989)]

d ¯U =

pdV.

from which it follows that

¯U = ρV

so that by comparing to equation (5), it follows that the equation of state
for matter is

This is the same as obtained from the ideal gas law for zero temperature.
Recall that in this derivation we have not introduced any kinetic energy, so
we are talking about zero temperature.

2.2 Radiation

The equation of state for radiation can be derived by considering radiation
modes in a cavity based on analogy with a violin string [Kubo (1967)]. For
a standing wave on a string ﬁxed at both ends

where L is the length of the string, λ is the wavelength and n is a positive
integer (n = 1, 2, 3.....). Radiation travels at the velocity of light, so that

where f is the frequency. Thus substituting f = n
¯U = ¯hω = hf , where h is Planck’s constant, gives

occur in the evolution of the Universe.

3 Velocity and Acceleration Equations

The equation which speciﬁes the speed of recession is obtained by writing
the total energy E as the sum of kinetic plus potential energy terms (and
using M = 4

corresponding to the total energy E being positive, zero or negative. For a
particle in motion near the Earth this would correspond to the particle escap-
ing (unbound), reaching inﬁnity with zero speed (critical case) or returning
(bound) to Earth because the speed ˙r would be greater, equal to or smaller

than the escape speed vescape. Later this will be analagous to an open, ﬂat
or closed universe. Equation (15) is re-arranged as

which speciﬁes the speed of recession. The scale factor is introduced because
in general relativity it is space itself which expands. Even though this equa-
tion is derived for matter, it is also true for radiation. The same equation is
obtained in general relativity [Islam (1992)]. According to Guth [Guth and
Steinhardt (1989)], k can be rescaled so that instead of being negative, zero
1, 0 or +1. From a geometric, general
or positive it takes on the values
relativistic point of view this corresponds to an open, ﬂat or closed universe.
In elementary mechanics the speed v of a ball dropped from a height r
is evaluated from the conservation of energy equation as v = √2gr, where
g is the acceleration due to gravity. The derivation shown above is exactly
analagous to such a calculation. Similarly the acceleration a of the ball is
calculated as a = g from Newton’s equation F = m¨r, where F is the force
d2r
and the acceleration is ¨r
dt2 . The acceleration for the universe is obtained
from Newton’s equation

However because M = 4
3πr3ρ was used, it is clear that this acceleration
equation holds only for matter. In our example of the falling ball instead of
the acceleration being obtained from Newton’s Law, it can also be obtained
by taking the time derivative of the energy equation to give a = dv
dr =
(√2gr)(√2g 1
2√r ) = g. Similarly, for the general case one can take the time
derivative of equation (18) (valid for matter and radiation) [Madsen (1995)]

which reduces to equation (20) for the matter equation of state (γ = 0). The
same equation is obtained in general relativity [Islam (1992), Milne (1934),
McCrea and Milne (1934), Bondi (1961)].

4 Cosmological Constant

In both Newtonian and relativistic cosmology the universe is unstable to
gravitational collapse. Both Newton and Einstein believed that the Universe
is static. In order to obtain this Einstein introduced a repulsive gravitational
force, called the cosmological constant, and Newton could have done exactly
the same thing, had he believed the universe to be ﬁnite.

In order to obtain a possibly zero acceleration, a positive term (conven-

tionally taken as Λ

3 ) is added to the acceleration equation (22) as

¨a
a

=

4πG
3

−

(ρ + 3p) +

Λ

which, with the proper choice of Λ can give the required zero acceleration
for a static universe. Again exactly the same equation is obtained from the
Einstein ﬁeld equations [Islam (1992)]. What has been done here is entirely
equivalent to just adding a repulsive gravitational force in Newton’s Law.
The question now is how this repulsive force enters the energy equation (18).

Let us comment on the repulsive harmonic oscillator obtained above.
Recall one of the standard problems often assigned to students in mechanics
courses. The problem is to imagine that a hole has been drilled from one side
of the Earth, through the center and to the other side and to show that if a
ball is dropped into the hole, it will execute harmonic motion. The solution
is obtained by noting that whereas gravity is an inverse square law for point
masses M and m separated by a distance r as given by F = G M m
r2 , yet if one
of the masses is a continous mass distribution represented by a density then
F = G 4
3πρmr. The force rises linearly as the distance is increased because
the amount of matter enclosed keeps increasing. Thus the gravitational force
for a continuous mass distribution rises like Hooke’s law and thus oscillatory
solutions are encountered. This sheds light on our repulsive oscillator found
above. In this case we want the gravity to be repulsive, but the cosmological
constant acts just like the uniform matter distribution.

Finally authors often write the cosmological constant in terms of a vac-
8πGρvac so that the velocity and acceleration

4.1 Einstein Static Universe

Although we have noted that the cosmological constant provides repulsion,
it is interesting to calculate its exact value for a static universe [Atwater
(1974), Adler et al (1975)]. The Einstein static universe requires a = a0 =

7

constant and thus ˙a = ¨a = 0. The case ¨a = 0 will be examined ﬁrst. From
equation (23) this requires that

Λ = 4πG(ρ + 3p) = 4πG(1 + γ)ρ.

(31)

If there is no cosmological constant (Λ = 0) then either ρ = 0 which is an
1
empty universe, or p =
3ρ which requires negative pressure. Both of these
alternatives were unacceptable to Einstein and therefore he concluded that
a cosmological constant was present, i.e. Λ
= 0. From equation (31) this
implies

−

and because ρ is positive this requires a positive Λ. Substituting equation (32)
into equation (28) it follows that

ρ =

Λ
4πG(1 + γ)

Λ =

3 + γ

[(

].

Now imposing ˙a = 0 and assuming a matter equation of state (γ = 0) implies
Λ = k
a2
0

. However the requirement that Λ be positive forces k = +1 giving

Thus the cosmological constant is not any old value but rather simply the
inverse of the scale factor squared, where the scale factor has a ﬁxed value
in this static model.

5 Conservation laws

Just as the Maxwell equations imply the conservation of charge, so too do
our velocity and acceleration equations imply conservation of energy. The
energy-momentum conservation equation is derived by setting the covariant
derivative of the energy momentum tensor equal to zero. The same result is
achieved by taking the time derivative of equation (29). The result is

˙ρ + 3(ρ + p)

= 0.

6 Quantum Cosmology

The discussion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace ap-
proximation [Hartle and Hawking (1983), Kolb and Turner (1990), Atkatz
(1994), Atkatz and Pagels (1982)] is usually restricted to closed (k = +1) and
empty (ρ = 0) universes. Atkatz [Atkatz (1994)] presented a very nice dis-
cussion for closed and empty universes. Herein we consider closed, open and
ﬂat and empty and non-empty universes. It is important to consider the pos-
sible presence of matter and radiation as they might otherwise change the
conclusions. Thus presented below is a derivation of the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation in the minisuperspace approximation which also includes matter
and radiation and arbitrary values of k.

For the empty Universe case of no matter or radiation (A = 0) the po-
tential U(a) is plotted in Figure 1 for the cases k = +1,
1 respectively
corresponding to closed [Kolb and Turner (1990)] and open universes. It can
be seen that only the closed universe case provides a potential barrier through
which tunneling can occur. The open universe would immediately recollapse.
(Actually for the open universe the Lagrangian is complex, so this discussion
may be meaningless. In either case it is clear that an open universe cannot
arise via quantum tunneling.) This provides a clear illustration of the idea
that only closed universes can arise through quantum tunneling [Atkatz and
Pagels (1982)]. For a ﬂat universe (k = 0), the potential is not deﬁned and
thus this process of quantum tunneling cannot give rise to a ﬂat universe. If
radiation (γ = 1 and A
= 0) is included then only a negative constant will
be added to the potential (because the term a1
γ will be constant for γ = 1)
−
and these conclusions about tunneling will not change. The shapes in Figure
1 will be identical except that the whole graph will be shifted downwards by
a constant with the inclusion of radiation. (For matter (γ = 0 and A
= 0) a
term growing like a will be included in the potential which will only be im-
portant for very small a and so the conclusions again will not be changed.)
To summarize, only closed universes can arise from quantum tunneling even
if matter or radiation is present.

Abstract

We present an application of the basic mathematical concept of complex
functions as topological solitons, a most interesting area of research in physics.
Such application of complex theory is virtually unknown outside the community
of soliton researchers.

received a lot of attention, models bearing the so-called solitons or energy ‘lumps’.

Some of these models exemplify yet another important application of complex
functions, with functions as simple as f (z) = z describing a soliton conﬁguration.
Unfortunately, despite the vast literature dealing with complex analysis plus
applications, one ﬁnds no mention of the starring role of z as a soliton. Reference
to such an extraordinary role is found only in highly specialised research books
and journals, hence the existence of z as a soliton ﬁeld is practically unknown
outside the group of specialists in the area.

Using the nonlinear sigma O(3) (or CP 1) model in two spatial dimensions,
the present work illustrates the context in which z stands for a lump of energy.
This fact is most remarkable and, given the growing importance of solitons in
physics, we believe that more physicists should know about it. They will ﬁnd
this fresh utility of complex variables quite appealing.

1 Complex theory

Complex theory is a very important branch of mathematics. As a brush-up
we just recall that many integrals given in real form are easily evaluated by
relating them to complex integrals and using the powerful method of contour
integration based on Cauchy’s theorem. In fact, the basis of transform calculus is
the integration of functions of a complex variable. And intersections between lines
and circles, parallel or orthogonal lines, tangents, and the like usually become
quite simple when expressed in complex form.

Familiarity with the complex numbers starts early, when at high school the ba-
sics of z are taught. Then in college algebra/calculus one learns some more about
complex variables, with immediate applications to problems in both physics and
engineering like electric circuits and mechanical vibrating systems. Later on
complex holomorphic (analytic) functions are introduced, and then applied to a
variety of problems: heat ﬂow, ﬂuid dynamics, electrostatics and magnetostatics,
to name but few.

The concept of analyticity is extremely important. Many physical quantities
are represented by functions f (x, y), g(x, y) connected by the relations ∂xf =
∂xg, where ∂xf = ∂f /∂x, etc. It turns out that f and g may be
∂yg,
considered as the real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic function h of the
complex variable z:

∂yf =

−

The equations linking f and g are the Cauchy-Riemann conditions for h(z) being
holomorphic, and can be written compactly as

h(z) = f + ig.

We hereby show how functions of the type (1) describe solitons, giving yet
another fundamental, if little known, application of analytic complex functions.

2 Solitons

Nonlinear science has developed strongly over the past 40 years, touching upon
every discipline in both the natural and social sciences. Nonlinear systems appear
in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, metereology, engineer-
ing, economics and many more [2, 3].

Within the nonlinear phenomena we ﬁnd the concept of ‘soliton’. It has got
some working deﬁnitions, all amounting to the following picture: a travelling
wave of semi-permanent lump-like form. A soliton is a non-singular solution of a
non-linear ﬁeld equation whose energy density has the form of a lump localised
in space. Although solitons arise from nonlinear wave-like equations, they have
properties that resemble those of a particle, hence the suﬃx on to covey a cor-
puscular picture to the solitary wave. Solitons exist as density waves in spiral
galaxies, as lumps in the ocean, in plasmas, molecular systems, protein dynamics,
laser pulses propagating in solids, liquid crystals, elementary particles, nuclear
physics...

According to whether the solitonic ﬁeld equations can be solved or not, soli-
tons are said to be integrable or nonintegrable. Given the limitations to anal-
itycally handle nonlinear equations, it is not surprising that integrable solitons
are generally found only in one dimension. The dynamics of integrable solitons
is quite restricted; they usually move undistorted in shape and, in the event of a
collision, they scatter oﬀ undergoing merely a phase shift.

In higher dimensions the dynamics of solitons is far richer, but now we are in
the realm of nonintegrable models. In this case analytical solutions are practi-
cally restricted to static conﬁgurations and Lorentz transfomations thereof. (The
time evolution being studied via numerical simulations and other approximation
techniques.) A trait of nonintegrable solitons is that they carry a conserved
quantity of topological nature, the topological charge –hence the designation
topological solitons. Entities of this kind exhibit interesting stability and scatter-
ing processes, including soliton annihilation which can occur when lumps with
opposite topological charges (one positive, one negative) collide. For areas like
nuclear/particle physics such dynamics is of great relevance.

Using the simplest model available, below we illustrate the emergence of topo-

logical solitons and their representation as complex functions.

3 The planar O(3) model

Models in two dimensions have a wide range of applications. In physics they are
used in topics that include Heisenberg ferromagnets, the quantum Hall eﬀect, su-
perconductivity, nematic crystals, topological ﬂuids, vortices and solitons. Some
of these models also appear as low dimensional analogues of forefront non-abelian
gauge ﬁeld particle theories in higher dimensions, an example being the Skyrme
model of nuclear physics [4, 5].

One of the simplest such systems is the O(3) or CP 1 sigma model in (2+1)
dimensions (2 space, 1 time).
It involves three real scalar ﬁelds φj (j=1,2,3)
functions of the space-time coordinates (t, x, y) [6, 7]. The model is deﬁned by

does yield non-trivial non-singular solutions as we will later see.

Thus the map is harmonic if and only if ~φ constrains the rubber to lie on the
marble in a position of elastic equilibrium, ~τ = ~0, which is just equation (5).
These are our ﬁnite-energy conﬁgurations, of which the soliton solutions are a
subset.

3.2 Topological charge

In general, as the coordinate z = (x, y) ranges over the sphere S(x)

An expression for the topological charge is obtained by expanding the coor-
dinates φj of the area element of S(φ)
2 , and
integrating oﬀ. In plainer language, from the college formula that computes the

Notably, a ﬁeld with topological charge N describes precisely a system of N

In order to actually ﬁnd charge-N ﬁnite-energy solutions, it is convenient to
express the model in terms of one independent complex ﬁeld, W , related to ~φ

The solitonic solutions we seek correspond to the equality in (12) [9, 10, 11]. That
is, in a given topological sector N the static solitons of the planar CP 1 model
are the conﬁgurations whose energy E is an absolute minimum. Combining (11)
with E = 2π
we ﬁnd that solutions carrying positive or negative topological

But recalling equation (2) we immediately recognise the above equations as the
Cauchy-Riemann conditions for W being a holomorphic function of z or ¯z. This
is most remarkable.

For instance, a single-soliton solution (N = 1) may be described by

W = z

its energy density distribution is given by

Plots of (16) reveal a lump of energy localised in space, as shown in ﬁgure 1. The
same energy corresponds to W = ¯z, which has N < 0 and sometimes is referred
to as an anti-soliton.

according to (10). A prototype

The dynamics of these structures is studied by numerically evolving the full
time-dependent equation derived from (3), with the ﬁelds W (z) as initial condi-
tions [12, 13].

Sigma CP 1-type models have several applications, noteworthy among them
being the Skyrme model in (3+1) dimensions where the topological solitons stand
for ground states of light nuclei, with the topological charge representing the
baryon number.

The role of complex functions as topological solitons deserves widespread
attention and should not be missing from the modern literature dealing with
complex theory and its applications.

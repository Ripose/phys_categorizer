Abstract

All electromagnetic moments (form factors) of spin- 1

2 fermions are, in prin-
ciple, well known but unfortunately only to a specialized audience. Due to
historical reasons usually only half of them ﬁnd their entry into the textbooks.
This is a slightly surprising state of aﬀairs given the importance of the gen-
eral result, its model independence, its connection to discrete symmetries and
their violations and last but not least the fact that the derivation of the gen-
eral result requires only the knowledge of the Dirac equation.
In this paper
we attempt in a pedagogical way to derive all four electromagnetic moments
of a spin- 1
2 fermion. We discuss the rich phenomenology connected directly
with these form-factors, and among others spin precession in external ﬁelds
and spin-synchrotron radiation.

1 Introduction

Our motivation to review such an old subject as the electromagnetic moments (or
form-factors) of a spin- 1
2 fermion [1] stems from diﬀerent aspects of particle physics,
relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum ﬁeld theory and the classroom teaching of
this traditional topic. One of the main reasons to elaborate on this subject is simply
the fact that the general result is rarely discussed in detail, be it in textbooks or
classrooms. It is frequently not presented in its full generality and, if encountered
occasionally, no derivation is given. Now it is not always pedagogically justiﬁed to
present right in the beginning a general result. However, in the case of the electro-
magnetic moments the contrary is true as their derivation is conceptually not diﬃcult.
Of course, there are also more profound reasons to be quoted. For instance,
the class of massive spin- 1
2 fermions can be divided into the distinct subclasses of
Dirac- and Majorana- fermions [2]. Whereas the former apart from its mass and spin
carries a global quantum number (like electric charge or lepton number) and has a
distinct anti-particle (think about electron and positron), the Majorana-fermions do
not carry any such quantum number and are therefore anti-particles to themselves.
The solution to solar and atmospheric neutrino anomaly as well as recent experiments
make it almost unavoidable that the neutrinos are massive particles [3]. Being neutral
they are also good candidates for Majorana-fermions. Our interest here is that the
electromagnetic properties of Dirac and Majorana fermions diﬀer greatly. The Dirac
particle couples to a photon in four diﬀerent ways (i.e. it has four form-factors), the
Majorana particle has only one which in general is omitted from the discussion.

Historically the omission of half of the result has been justiﬁed by the fact
that the omitted half violates discrete symmetries like time-reversal (T ), parity (P )
and charge-conjugation (C) or its combinations like CP . At the very early stage of
particle physics such a violation was not a desired property. When later experiments
arrived at a diﬀerent verdict on this matter (indeed all these discrete symmetries are
violated), the tradition was already rooted and partly justiﬁed by the fact that the
T, C, P - violating form-factor must be smaller than their counter parts preserving
these symmetries. Nowadays the situation has changed. To ﬁnd a manifestation of
say, the violation of the time-reversal symmetry in the electromagnetic case is welcome
and even a subject of textbooks [4].

Apart from the Dirac/Majorana nature of massive neutrinos and their diﬀerent
electromagnetic properties, the question of discrete symmetries and their violation,
there is yet another intriguing aspect of the form-factors. It was long thought that the
measurement of the ﬁrst two electromagnetic form-factors of the nucleons is a closed
subject and only the issue of their parametrization remains to be discussed [5]. New
measurements at Jeﬀerson Laboratory [6] have, however, revealed a serious discrep-
ancy: the old measurements do not agree with these new measurements using recoil
polarization! The reason is still unknown, but this certainly adds some excitement to
the subject of electromagnetic form factors.

Last but not least, our motivation is to look for a consistency and completeness
in teaching quantum mechanics. We start to learn or teach quantum mechanics by
the assertion that the interpretation of the theory is only possible if given a wave-
function ψ(x, t) the probability density ρ = ψ†ψ is (i) positive deﬁnite (which in the
form ψ†ψ is the case) and (ii) conserved i.e. there exist a probability current j such
that ∂ρ
j = 0. We can derive j given the Schr¨odinger equation for spin-0 particles.
The electromagnetic current is then J = qj with q the charge of the particle. The
matter of the current comes up once again in the classroom when confronting the
case of the Klein-Gordon equation (which has no positive deﬁnite density) with the
Dirac equation [7]. However from the physics point of view this is not a complete
picture as already the non-relativistic current for a spin- 1
2 particle governed by the
Pauli equation diﬀers from the spin-0 case for which one has

If surprises like the one mentioned above are possible, then what is the general rela-
tivistic current? This is a good student’s question which closes the circle at the point
where we start to learn quantum mechanics. This and the other reasons mentioned
above justify the pedagogical undertaking of looking closer at the general relativistic
electromagnetic current. In a way, the present paper can be considered as a continu-
ation of [9] where some aspects of (1.2) have been discussed.

(cid:1)

(1.2)

We will see in the last two sections that this is a rewarding task as the elec-
tromagnetic form-factors entering the relativistic current also determine the spin pre-
cession in external ﬁelds formulated in the so-called BMT equation [10, 11] which we
generalize here to include also the electric dipole moment. This on the other hand
can be used to derive an eﬀective Hamiltonian for spin-ﬂip synchrotron radiation i.e.
for emission of photons in external ﬁelds with a simultaneous change of the particle’s
spin.

Unless otherwise stated we use throughout the paper ~ = c = 1.

2 A Small Digression on Dirac Algebra

To answer the student’s question about the general current we need some reminders
of the basic properties of the Dirac equation and the algebra related to it. We assume
that the reader is familiar with the Dirac equation (see [7, 12] for details):

We oﬀer here a proof of the second identity in (2.8) and suggest the rest as an
exercise to the reader. The ﬁrst step in proving this identity is to use the basis given
in (2.5). In particular it means that any product of two or more matrices from

be expanded into the basis of
that Tr[ΓiΓj] = 0. Hence the coeﬃcients of the expansion are easily calculable. For
instance:

γασµν = aµνα1l + bµναγ5 + cµναβγβ + dµναβγ5γβ + eµναρδσρδ

(2.10)

We have

and

Similarly, from

it follows that

Tr[γασµν] = aµναTr[1l],

Tr[γασµν] = 0, hence aµνα = 0.

Tr[γασµνγ5] = Tr[γασµνσρδ] = 0

bµνα = eµναρδ = 0.

Tr[γασµνγβ] = 4cµναβ

and

Tr[γ5γασµνγβ] = 4dµναβ

The non-zero coeﬃcient can be computed by noticing that

Calculating these traces explicitly we get

γασµν = i[gαµgβν

and use (2.3) to arrive at the second identity in (2.8)

So far our discussion was rather formal and does not seem related to the
relativistic current. However, we will see below that the Gordon-like identities are
necessary to reduce the number of candidates in the ansatz for the relativistic current
to linear independent contributions.

Note that without the requirement of gauge invariance we can just derive what is
called weak form-factor decomposition.

4 The Weak Current

The next step in deriving the general relativistic electromagnetic current for spin- 1
2
particles consists of collecting all possible four-vectors by which we can parametrize
Oµ. If we eliminate some candidates by using only Diracology, especially the Gordon-
like identities, we arrive at a current which is called weak current i.e. a non-conserved
current (as we do not insist on gauge invariance) to which the massive vector bosons
of weak interactions couple in analogy to electrodynamics where Aµjµ represents the
coupling of the photon to the matter current. The fact that the weak current is not
conserved has to do with the non-zero masses of the vector bosons mediating weak
interaction [14]. Insisting in the next section on gauge invariance this gives us the
electromagnetic current.

the Gordon-like identities involving the Levi-Cevita tensor in (2.8) demonstrate that
only one candidate in
O3 is independent. Hence, taking everything together we arrive
at six independent terms i.e.

1.) In the derivation of (5.3) we have considered the diagonal case i.e. the ket and
bra in (3.1) ‘belong’ to a particle with diﬀerent momentum, but the same mass (like
an electron). But, in principle, we could have started also with the oﬀ-diagonal case
(say, electron and muon as the incoming and outgoing particles). In this case the

2.) The decomposition (5.3) and (5.5) is equally valid for point-like particles like
electron or muon as well as for extended particles like neutron and proton. It is valid
for Dirac and Majorana fermions. We will however, see later that there is a diﬀerence
between these two types of fermions as far as their electromagnetic properties are
concerned. It is valid for charged and neutral fermions. The latter have a coupling
to a photon either because of their extended nature or through its spin (spin-ﬁeld
interaction) as we will see later.

The diﬀerence between extended and point-like (elementary) particles is that extended
spin- 1
2 fermions have a priori the general form-factor structure given in (5.3) and (5.5)
(q2) is diﬃcult to calculate on ﬁrst
as a result of their size. The functional form of Fi ·
principles, because it depends on the internal structure of the proton and neutron.
For point-like objects we have a somewhat better undertaking. The ‘real’ point-like
coupling is eAµ ¯ψγµψ i.e. out of the four possibilities in (5.3) we have only one.
Higher order corrections of perturbation theory (they do depend also on discrete
symmetries which we will discuss in point 4.) can induce then the structure (5.3).
The usual picture behind this is that there is essentially no ‘bare’ electron. It is always
surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles-antiparticles which makes it essentially an
extended object.

3.) What is the meaning of the form-factors? The easiest way to get some insight into
an interpretation of Fi is to couple the current to Aµ and take the non-relativistic

9

limit. This is well known [1, 15, 16] and we quote only the result. One ﬁnds

leading to the interaction Hamiltonian

F1(0) = Q (charge)

H N R

int [F1] = F1(0)A0

where A0 is the zeroth component of the four vector potential Aµ. Similarly one can
interpret

1
2m

[F1(0) + F2(0)] = µ (magnetic moment)

and deduce the Hamiltonian to have the form

This gives rise to one of the most accurate predictions for µ. If we take F1(0) = e
and F2 proportional to e we can deﬁne the magnetic moment µ as g(e/4m) where g
in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is simply 2. If there is a deviation from this
value, it is convenient to deﬁne a so-called anomalous magnetic moment a as

The combined world average turns out to be

Whether this value agrees with theoretical predictions is still a matter of debate [18].
Both form-factors F1 and F2 have been measured over a wide range of q2. The re-
sults have been parametrized in diﬀerent forms. For a quite recent discussion see [5].
However, as already mentioned, there seems to be a discrepancy between these older
results and recent experiments which extract the two form-factors through polariza-
tion measurements [6]. This is a very surprising outcome as the physics of the two
form-factors appeared to be a closed chapter, at least as far as their experimental
determination is concerned. Certainly the explanation for this discrepancy is eagerly
awaited.

The third form-factor is connected with the electric dipole moment via

Up to now nobody has measured an non-zero F3 at any value of q2 or for any particle.
This is not so surprising as we indeed expect this form-factor to be small. This expec-
tation is based on the fact that the electric dipole moment breaks the time reversal
symmetry, as we will see below. We have indirect evidence from other experiments
that such a violation occurs in nature, but the very same experiments indicate that it
has to be small. Nevertheless both theoretical physicists [19] and the experimentalists
[20] think that it may be possible to ﬁnd a non-zero F3 in future.

and it is an excellent exercise to ﬁnd the proportionality factor in the above equation.
F4(0) is called (Zeldovich) anapole moment and has a number of unusual properties.
Firstly, note that by one of the Maxwell equations H N R
= 0
i.e. one of the sources of E and B is non-zero. This means that the coupling of the
anapole moment to external electromagnetic ﬁelds E and B is of relevance only in
matter! Considered as the coupling of a photon to the fermion, the anapole coupling
is zero if the photon is real (on-shell ; q2 = 0 and ǫµqµ = 0). Hence, for instance,
in bremsstrahlung processes F4 does not contribute, but in processes with oﬀ-shell
photon it does. As is the case with F3 we also lack a direct experimental evidence for
F4. The reason is again to be searched in violation of one of the discrete symmetries.
We can convince ourselves that F4 violates parity, a violation not as small as the one
ep
encountered in connection with the time reversal. But in a real process like ep
where the form-factors are measured, the parity violation through F4 can interfere
with a parity violation originating directly though weak interaction i.e. through a
Z 0 exchange instead of a photon. The Z 0-proton-proton interaction will be given by
(4.5). It is hard to disentangle both contributions in a model independent way.

classical electromagnetism and non-relativistic quantum mechanics that under parity

It is then obvious from our H N R
int [Fi] that the existence of non-zero F1 and F2 are
compatible with P and T invariance. A non-zero F4 signals clearly violation of parity
conservation and F3 6
= 0 would tell us that time-reversal invariance is broken. Since
electromagnetic interaction by itself conserves both discrete symmetries we would ex-
pect F3 = F4 = 0 (indeed, in most older textbooks only F1 and F2 are discussed).

If a scalar ﬁeld representing a spin-0 particle has no global quantum

Dirac equation (2.1) C transforms u from eq.(2.2) to v via v(p) = C ¯uT(p). If ψ is a
c-number, we get ( ¯ψΓψ) = ( ¯ψΓψ)T, of course. For ψ being an operator we pick up
a minus sign in this process since fermionic operators anticommute . After a careful
evaluation of ( ¯ψΓψ)† using (2.6) one gets

1. Hence a Majorana fermion has only
one electromagnetic moment: the anapole moment. This is in strong contrast to the
Dirac case. Interestingly, this fact is again connected to another symmetry of nature
[21], that is the combination of CPT. It is indeed a basic symmetry, since no violation
of CPT has been reported so far.

eral important applications. In the form
energy and in quantum ﬁeld theory it results in all possible interaction terms of a
R
photon with fermions, the so-called vertices. Yet there are other important applica-
tions of the form-factors found in jµ. One of them is spin precession [10, 11] which,
in principle, touches upon aspects of classical electrodynamics as we are deriving this
precession for the expectation value of the spin operator in a semi-classical limit.

We have seen that the form-factors Fi=2,3,4 lead in a non-relativistic reduction
to spin-ﬁeld interaction Hamiltonians (5.9) and (5.12). Restricting ourselves to F2

and F3 (taking also F4 would force us to consider the spin-precession in matter, a
complication which we want to avoid here) these Hamiltonians also determine via the
Heisenberg equation the time evolution of the operator ˆs = (1/2)σ. Explicitly we get

(6.1)

where the primes indicate that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds values are taken in
the rest frame of the particle. In this equation we set ~ = 1.

Conceptually electromagnetism consists of (i) the Maxwell equations which
determine the ﬁelds from the sources and (ii) the Lorentz force which determines the
trajectory of the test charge. However, from the point of view of quantum mechanics
the latter is an expectation value of, say, velocity in the semi-classical approximation.
Seen from this perspective the equation for the expectation value of the spin in an
external ﬁeld has the same conceptual status as the Lorentz force. We could add such
a semi-classical equation for spin as a third point (iii) to the other points above to
encompass the whole classical electromagnetism.

Denoting the expectation value of the spin by ξ we get from (6.1)

where in accordance with equation (6.1) the change of the expectation value ξ with
respect to time should be evaluated in the rest frame as indicated. The above equation
is derived from a non-relativistic Hamiltonian and is therefore only a non-relativistic
form of a more general equation which we are looking for. Such relativistic generaliza-
tion calls also for the relativistic generalization of the concept of spin sµ. In a similar
way in which for a relativistic concept of a four-vector force f µ leads to f 0 = f
v,
one can also show that s0 = s
v or in other words

sµpµ = sµuµ = 0

where uµ is the four-velocity. Essentially (6.3) follows from sµ
restframe = (0, ξ). With
these provisions one can derive the relativistic version of (6.2) either from Dirac
equation directly or by a similar method with which we derived the relativistic current
in previous sections. This essentially means that replacing dξ/dt by dsµ/dτ with τ the
proper time, we look for possible expressions for the right-hand-side of the following
equation

dsµ
dτ

= Λµ

Fαβ, uα,

where Fαβ is the electromagnetic stress tensor. In deriving Λµ one makes some as-
sumptions. The ﬁrst one refers to the external ﬁeld. They should be weak in order
to avoid pair-production which is a topic reserved for quantum ﬁeld theory. This
assumption also tells us that we can restrict ourselves to an expression linear in the

stress tensor. The second assumption in connection with the external ﬁelds is to
assume the latter to be almost (but not quite) constants. This helps us in as far as
we can neglect derivatives of the ﬁelds. Finally the third assumption is motivated by
(6.2): Λµ should be homogeneous in ﬁelds and homogeneous and linear in the spin
sµ.

It makes sense to deal ﬁrst with a general force that is not necessarily of
electromagnetic nature which accelerates the particle. This implies that no stress
tensor should enter our expression and therefore, in agreement with the assumption
we made, our candidates for Λα are only two

electromagnetic forces driving the particle (the non-electromagnetic are contained in

Using the last form the spin precession can be investigated in diﬀerent ﬁeld conﬁg-
urations. It is not our objective here to perform such calculations. Rather we note
that essentially the spin precession is closely connected to the electromagnetic current
through the moments µ and d. Here the inclusion of the electric dipole moment d
is new as compared to the standard BMT equation [23]. Such a contribution is cer-
tainly small as it violates time reversal symmetry, but still worth a closer examination
be it only for pedagogical reasons. Also worthwhile mentioning is the fact that the
anomalous magnetic moment a can be measured using the BMT equation [24, 25].

Certainly, one could also include the precession of the spin due to the anapole
j where j is the current density
moment starting from a non-relativistic expression ξ
i.e. ∂µF µν = jν. Evidently
understood as the source of the electromagnetic ﬁelds.
such contribution to the spin precession is possible only in matter. Also obvious is the
need to work now with derivatives of the ﬁelds. Instead of the electromagnetic ﬁelds
we could, however, work directly with jµ to collect all candidates of the corresponding
part of the BMT equation in analogy to what we have done for the magnetic and
electric dipole moment.

7 Time reversal violating synchrotron radiation

One of the nice applications of (6.19) is spin-synchrotron radiation in which photons
are emitted in the course of a spin transition from an initial sate i to a ﬁnal one f [26].
Given the ubiquitous importance of synchrotron radiation in physics and astrophysics
we consider this as a nice instructive example. To be able to calculate the usual
observables of such a radiation we need an eﬀective spin-ﬁeld interaction Hamiltonian.
Obviously such an Hamiltonian will generalize the non-relativistic results in equations
(5.9) and (5.12). The relation between the BMT equation and this Hamiltonian is the
same as between (6.1) and (6.2). We easily see that we can mathematically exchange
in them the expectation value for the spin operator. Hence using the same technique
here gives us

Indeed, using the Heisenberg equation with the above Hamiltonian would give us the
BMT equation with ξ replaced by ˆs. In the spirit of non-relativistic quantum me-
chanics (not necessarily relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, however) this Hamiltonian
is the relativistic generalization of (7.1) [26]. This is part of the reason why it is
worth mentioning it. The standard Hamiltonian for non-spin part of the synchrotron
radiation is

(7.4)

Note that in contrast to (7.2) the Hamiltonian (7.1) and (7.4) obviously contain the
spin ˆs = ~σ/2. Here we have re-introduced ~ explicitly (in the rest of the paper we
set ~ = 1) to make clear that the eﬀects calculated with the help of (7.1) are ’true’
quantum mechanical eﬀects (in contrast to standard, classical synchrotron radiation
eﬀects which are zeroth order in ~). Such an eﬀect is e.g. the polarization eﬀect
of electrons and/or positrons in synchrotron storage rings which can be explained
by using the Ω1 in (7.1). The results of such a calculation also follow from basic
premises of quantum ﬁeld theory, but using (7.1) seems to be more instructive as it

17

can be done already at the level of quantum theory and what is more, it contains an
arbitrary g factor which helps to explain certain issues of the result.

The part proportional to Ω2 in (7.1) violates time reversal symmetry. One can

(7.5)

see that by adding to our previous T -transformations (5.15) the obvious rule

−→ −
As discussed in connection with the electric dipole moment itself we know that phe-
nomena which violate time reversal symmetry are extremely rare. We therefore expect
that the measurable eﬀects in connection with this part of the Hamiltonian are very
small too. However, there is also a rewarding aspect of our Hamiltonian. Theoreti-
cally time reversal violating eﬀects are introduced using all the machinery of quantum
ﬁeld theory [27]. Here we derived one example by very simple means. In principle, it
must be possible to construct an observable in the form of an asymmetry to extract
the time reversal violating part i.e. these eﬀects should be proportional only to d.
This can serve as an introduction to important tools used all over physical sciences.
The explicit calculation of the rate for synchrotron radiation with spin transition can
be carried through along the same lines as explained in in [26], where only the ﬁrst
part of the Hamiltonian (7.4) was used.

8 Discussion

From the Dirac equation and the general relativistic current for a spin-1/2 fermion
to the time-reversal violating synchrotron radiation is a long way. This demonstrates
the rich phenomenology in connection with the current and the form factors con-
tained therein. From the discrepancy between diﬀerent measurements of Fi=1,2 for
the nucleons and from the still lacking information on Fi=3,4 we can see that the sub-
ject is still an active ﬁeld for investigations. Seen from this point of view, one could
say that the form factors of the nucleons are still not accurately known, a rather
surprising and disturbing conclusion as the form factors are an important source of
information on the nucleon structure [28]. For this reason we presented in this article
a comprehensive summary of the subject.

All the physics presented in the paper can be understood by students who have
mastered the Dirac equation. A large part of the phenomenology is still unexplored
and as such a good material for a student to do some research and projects of his/her
own. This is certainly the case when we look for solutions of the BMT equation
in various ﬁeld conﬁgurations. The time reversal violating part oﬀers also several
possibilities in this direction. A BMT equation including the anapole moment remains
an open subject for investigation.

A good deal of physics and its diﬀerent methods of calculation and reason-
ing can be introduced by deriving the current and its consequences as done in the
present paper. Some example are the discrete symmetries and their violation. An-
other example is the derivation of the BMT equation which proceeds via elimination

18

of candidates. Features important for fundamental physics and astrophysics like the
diﬀerence between Majorana and Dirac fermions can be already touched upon.

Finally, a quantum mechanical current has of course many diﬀerent applica-

tions, sometimes surprising ones [29].

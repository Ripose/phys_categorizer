We describe a simple mechanical system that involves Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking. The system consists
of two beads constrained to slide along a hoop and attached each other through a spring. When the hoop rotates
about a ﬁxed axis, the spring-beads system will change its equilibrium position as a function of the angular
velocity. The system shows two diﬀerent regions of symmetry separated by a critical point analogous to a second
order transition. The competitive balance between the rotational diynamics and the interaction of the spring causes
an Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking just as the balance between temperature and the spin interaction causes a
transition in a ferromagnetic system. In addition, the gravitational potential act as an external force that causes
explicit symmetry breaking and a feature of ﬁrst-order transition. Near the transition point, the system exhibits a
universal critical behavior where the changes of the parameter of order is described by the critical exponent β = 1/2
and the susceptibility by γ = 1. We also found a chaotic behavior near the critical point. Through a demostrative
device we perform some qualitative observations that describe important features of the system.

volves other related concepts. For example, it can be used
in a basic level of classical mechanics as an application of
rotational dynamics and to visualize the stability of sys-
tems from energy diagrams. In a higher level, it can be
introduced as an example in the Lagrangian formulation
of analytical mechanics. In a thermodynamic framework,
this model illustrates the behavior of a ﬁrst- and second-
order trasition according to the Tisza’s deﬁnition. Futher-
more, because of the nature of the SSB, this system ex-
hibits a critical behavior near the transition point which
belongs to the same universality class as a large number
of thermodynamic systems. Thus, this problem may pro-
vide instructive insights that concern with more advanced
topics into the classical study of the critical phenomena
in phase transitions. In addition, the system presents in-
teresting properties associated with nonlinear solutions,
which may be source of chaotic behavior and generates a
simple application into the theory of classical chaos.
II Stability

Although gauge theories and Spontaneous Symmetry
Breaking (SSB) [1] are rather abstract concepts which are
associated with symmetries operating on internal degrees
of freedom, their signiﬁcance and nature emerges in a quite
straightforward way through systems that exhibit geomet-
rical properties associated with space-time symetries, and
that shares the same basic features as models with gauge

with classical systems are found [2], where diﬀerent me-
chanical models are used to illustrate similar characteris-
tics found in particle physics and solid state physics. In
this work with a simple mathematical treatment, we de-
scribe another mechanical system that exhibits SSB and
dynamical restitution of a discrete symmetry in a similar
fashion as a second order phase transition. In contrast to
the systems reported by the literature, our model is in a
closer relation with a thermodynamic system in the sense
that the former use the gravity as an essential external
parameter to generate symmetry restitution, while ours
may generate spontaneous breaking and restitution with
only internal interactions, where the gravity act as an ex-
ternal ﬁeld that causes explicit symmetry breaking, such
as external interactions cause explicit breaking in thermal
physics. The model shows not only interesting features
that resembles to the SSB in gauge theories, but also in-

We consider two identical beads of mass m that can slide
without friction on a horizontal hoop of radius R. There
appears a potential of interaction through a spring at-
tached to both beads. The spring constant is k and its
equilibrium length is less that the diameter of the hoop,
i.e. 2r0 < 2R. The system is sketched in Fig. 1, where the
position z0 of both beads is the same measured from the

positions determined by the transformation z0 → −
which illustrates the presence of a discrete symmetry. The
hoop rotates about the z axis at angular velocity ω, which
causes the equilibrium position z0 to decrease and the
spring to stretch from its natural length 2r0 to a longer
length 2r. The lagrangian contains the kinetic energy of
each bead and the elastic potential of the spring, while
the gravitational potential is not considered because the
center of mass of the system lies along the horizontal axis
z. It is more suitable to write the lagrangian in cylindrical
coordinates, which displays in a simpler form the symme-
tries and constraints of the system. The lagrangian is then
written as

in either a positive or a negative coordinate z, which is
greater with decreasing ω. Thus, the absolute value of z

We can describe this process like a second order phase
transition if we investigate the behavior of the eﬀective
potential in the critical point with respect to the variation
of the angular velocity. The Ehrenfest deﬁnition estab-
lish that a phase transition with respect to a thermody-
namic variable (like temperature) is of nth order if the
1) st-order derivatives are continuous
energy and its (n
at the transition point, whereas the nth-order derivative
suﬀers a ﬁnite discontinuous jump.
In fact, our system
presents continuous derivative at ﬁrst-order but suﬀers an
inﬁnite discontinuity in the second-order derivative d2Vef
dω2
as is shown in Fig. 3, where the angular velocity ω works
like the temperature in a thermodynamic system. The in-
ﬁnite jumps are described by the Tisza’s Theory [3] which
describes most of the higher-order phase transition.

We emphasize that this behavior is analogous but not
equal to the SSB in quantum theory. The analogy arises
when the minimum of energy splits into new degenerated
minima. Nonetheless, classically the system will maintain
its symmetrical unstable equilibrium unless there appears
external ﬂuctuations that are not being considered into
the equation of motion (in this sense this is not a ”true”

where the last term corresponds to the gravitational

tial is taken in the symmetrical point z = 0. It is clear
that Eq. (8) does not hold the symmetry z
z due
to the gravitational term, which will favor negative po-
sitions with lower energy. In this case, the symmetrical
plots from Fig. 2 will suﬀer slight deformations, such as
is illustrated in Fig. 4, where we can see that for ω < ωc
the minima splits into two diﬀerent values as local and
global minima. This behavior is observed, for instance,
in an atom or molecule that presents a degenerated spec-
trum of energy due to the spherical symmetry. If there
are external ﬁelds such as electric or magnetic ﬁelds, this
spectrum splits into many distinguished levels of energies
(Stark and Zeeman eﬀect). We can obtain a phase diagram
from the minima conditions. When the axis of rotation is
in horizontal position, the minima solutions in Eq. (5) as
a function of ω describes a plot analogous to the

magnetization-temperature phase diagram in a ferromag-
net, such as Fig. 5(a) shows. If the z-axis holds diﬀerent
angles α with respect to the horizontal plane, the min-
imum condition from the eﬀective potential in Eq.
(8)
describes a diagram as a function of Sinα similar to the
isotherms in a magnetization-magnetic ﬁeld phase dia-
gram (see Fig. 5(b)). When ω < ωc, Fig. 5(b) illustrates
how the global minimum jumps discontinuously from
z0
to z0 when α passes through zero, like a ﬁrst-order tran-
sition.

III Critical Exponents

Above, we identiﬁed the equilibrium position z0 as the
parameter of order which measures the degree of breaking
of the symmetry. The behavior of second-order transition
suggests us a critical behavior near the transition point.

Thus, the parameter of order spontaneously becomes
nonzero and grows as √ωc
ω for angular velocities nearly
below ωc. The critical exponent β = 1
2 associated with
the order parameter is identical to those obtained by the
classical Landau theory for thermodynamic parameters
[4, 5], such as the magnetic moment in a ferromagnetic
substance, the diﬀerence in Zn-Cu occupation in a binary
alloy, the molar volume liquid-gas in a ﬂuid, among other
second-order transitions.

This system could be thought as a mechanical equiva-
lent of a thermodynamic system, where the state is char-
acterized by three ”thermodynamic” variables: the equi-
librium position z0 (parameter of order), the angular ve-
locity ω (temperature-like variable) and the gravitational
force (pressure-like variable). A change of state can take
place if we introduce a ”heat reservoir”, which in our case
is a power source (for example an electric motor) that
provides the rotational energy to the hoop.
If we con-
sider the complete potential including the gravitational
coupling W = 2mgSinα, the condition in Eq. (13) takes
the form

We can study small oscillations about the equilibrium po-
sitions. For the symmetrical phase with ω > ωc, the eﬀec-
tive potential in (3) can be expanded in a Taylor’s series
about the minimum at z = 0, from where we obtain an

which is a quite complex equation to solve. We note
that this equation involves non-linear terms, which sug-
gests us a chaotic behavior. From data given in Sec. VI,
we consider numerical solutions with diﬀerent initial po-

sitions around the equilibrium points (the entrance

the position z as function of time and in the phase space
for ω < ωc. We see clearly that for small per-
turbations, the oscillations are restricted in regions with
(cid:16)
z > 0. In the phase space, this motion describes elliptic-
like paths (we also see that these paths are not perfect
ellipses due to anharmonic terms). If we increase the per-
turbation, the system reaches the transition point, where
the spring just oversteps the local maximum at z = 0,
and the oscillations extend to both regions. For greater
perturbations, the motion increases around all the hoop.
On the other hand, we can see in Fig. 8 that for
ω > ωc, the motion is developed around the equilibrium
point at z = 0, in agreement with the results of Sec. IV.

VI Experimental Description

We made a demostrative BHS-apparatus using a hoop
with radius R = 6 cm, a soft spring with natural length
r0 = 4.6 cm and constant k = 8.81 N/m, and two iron
rings used as beads, each one with mass m = 7.6 g. The
hoop was coupled to the axis of a DC motor with ad-
justable velocity (which will work like a ”heat reservoir”).
Aligning the rotational axis in a horizontal position,
the system describes the two regimes of symmetry. The

shows two cases with ω < ωc and one case with ω > ωc.
When the velocity was decreased below the critical value,
we noted that the chosen direction (+z or
z) was highly
sensitive to the way that the velocity was reduced and to
the mechanical ﬂuctuations near the transition. When the
velocity was slowly reduced in a quasi-static process across
the transition, the equilibrium position was maintained at
z = 0 (although we lubricate the hoop, the unstable equi-
librium found some stability due to the small friction), but
after some hesitating seconds the system ﬁnally fell into
one of the stable minima (long relaxation time), break-
ing the symmetry. However after several trials, we could
see that the symmetry was hidden in the sense that we
obtained about the same number of breakings into +z as
into
z, i.e. both posibilities have the same probability of
occurrence. Thus, we can see how the symmetry breaking
is spontaneous, where the non-symmetrical states present
two equally probable possibilities with the same energy.
On the other hand, the device had a high sensitivity to
the precision of the horizontal alignment. When the ro-

VII Summary and Conclusions

→ −

In this work we studied a bead-hoop-spring (BHS) system
under rotation as was described through the sections. The
system presents diﬀerent stability situations according to
the angular velocity of the hoop, exhibiting a second or-
der transition behavior, and where the position z0 of the
center of mass measured from the center of the hoop de-
ﬁnes a parameter of order. The symmetry transformation
z
z of the lagrangian is manifest if the angular ve-
locity is above a critical value ωc, where the equilibrium
position at z0 = 0 is stable. Below ωc, this equilibium
becomes unstable, and appears two degenerated minima
= 0. Thus, with only internal interactions (spring
with z0 6
force and normal force between hoop and beads), the sys-
tem exhibits an SSB below the critical value. If the gravi-
tational potential is considered, the stability regions suﬀer
a deformation, changing the equilibrium position at z = 0
into another diﬀerent from zero, and spliting the minima of
= 0 into two non-equivalent minima. Under
energy at z0 6
these circumstances, the system shows a preferential di-
rection exhibiting explicit symmetry breaking and a ﬁrst-
order transition behavior. The experimental observations
were in quite good agreement with the theoretical descrip-
tion, where the critical velocity was measured within an
8% of precision.

The system belongs to the same universality class that
many thermodynamic systems, exhibiting a Landau ex-

pansion. From a mean-ﬁeld-like approximation, we ob-
tained the critical exponent β = 1
2 and γ = 1 associated
with the parameter of order and the ”mechanical suscep-
tibility” respectively.

The frecuency of small oscillations about the stable
minima was also calculated. Above ωc, the frecuency Ω>
increases without limit with ω. Near the critical value,
the motion about z = 0 describes long-period oscillations,
which becomes into unbounded motion when ω passes
through the critical point. Below ωc, the frecuency Ω<
about the new minima increases with ω decreases.

The equation of motion exhibits some chaotic behav-
ior near the critical value, where the system reacts in a
random way for similar perturbation entrance.

This analogy between the mechanical system and a
thermodynamic system is highly suggestive, and it is very
tempter to apply a deeper study of ﬂuctuations below the
critical point through the deﬁnition of a correlation func-
tion and the implementation of a ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem [4, 5], which could provide some insights about
the physical sense of these concepts.

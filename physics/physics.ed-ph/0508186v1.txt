Rutherford scattering with radiation damping

Abstract

We study the eﬀect of radiation damping on the classical scattering of
charged particles. Using a perturbation method based on the Runge-Lenz
vector, we calculate radiative corrections to the Rutherford cross section,
and the corresponding energy and angular momentum losses.

1 Introduction

The reaction of a classical point charge to its own radiation was ﬁrst discussed
by Lorentz and Abraham more than one hundred years ago, and never stopped
being a source of controversy and fascination [1, 2, 3, 4]. Nowadays, it is proba-
bly fair to say that the most disputable aspects of the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac
theory, like runaway solutions and preacceleration, have been adequately un-
derstood and treated in terms of ﬁnite-size eﬀects (for a review see Ref. [4]). In
any case, radiation damping considerably complicates the equations of motion
of charged particles, and for many basic problems, like Rutherford scattering,
only numerical calculations of the trajectories are available [5, 6]. In this paper
we study the eﬀect of radiation reaction on the classical two-body scattering
of charged particles. Following Landau and Lifshitz [2], we expand the elec-
tromagnetic force in powers of c−1 (c is the speed of light), up to the order
c−3 where radiation damping appears. Then, using a perturbation technique
based on the Runge-Lenz vector [7], we calculate the radiation damping correc-
tions to the Rutherford deﬂection function and scattering cross section, and the
corresponding expressions for the angular momentum and energy losses.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we obtain the radiation damping
force on a system of charged particles, from the expansion of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in powers of 1/c. The equations of motion for a two-body system with
radiation reaction are discussed in Sec. 3, and in Sec. 4 we use the Runge-Lenz
vector to calculate the radiation eﬀect on classical Rutherford scattering. Some
ﬁnal remarks are made in Sec. 5.

2 The radiation damping force

In this section we reproduce, for completeness, the derivation of the radiation
damping force given by Landau and Lifshitz [2]. We start from the electromag-
netic potentials φ(r, t) and A(r, t), created by the charge and current densities
ρ(r, t) and J(r, t),

Here, R = |r − r′| and tR = t − R/c is the retarded time. The electric and
magnetic ﬁelds, E and B, are obtained from the potentials as

The φ potential given in Eq. (16) accounts for the Coulomb interaction. The

discarded the c−2 terms that account for the variation of mass with velocity and
the Darwin magnetic and retardation eﬀects. These terms do not interfere with
our treatment of radiation damping, and their eﬀect on Rutherford scattering
is discussed in Refs. [7, 8].

recoil eﬀects appear in Eq. (27) not only through the reduced mass µ, but also
via the eﬀective charge ˜q. In particular, if q1/m1 = q2/m2 we have ˜q = 0, and
there is no radiation reaction even though both particles are accelerating. This
is related to the fact that, in this case, there is no electric dipole radiation from
the system.

4 Radiative correction to Rutherford scattering

In the absence of perturbations, Rutherford scattering conserves the total energy
2 µv2 + q1q2/r, the angular momentum L = µr × v, and the Runge-Lenz
E = 1
vector [9]

A = v × L + q1q2 ˆr .
(29)
Here, v = dr/dt is the relative velocity and ˆr = r/r is the radial unit vector.
These conserved quantities are not independent: it is easily seen that A · L = 0
and

A2 = 2EL2/µ + (q1q2)2 = (v0L)2 + (q1q2)2 ,
(30)
where v0 is the initial (asymptotic) velocity. Taking the scalar product r · A,
one ﬁnds the Rutherford scattering orbit

r(ϕ) =

L2/µ
A cos ϕ − q1q2

,

where ϕ is the angle between r and A. During the collision, ϕ changes from
−ϕ0 to ϕ0, where

ϕ0 = cos

−1(q1q2/A) = tan

−1(v0L/q1q2) .

The scattering angle is θ = π − 2ϕ0, and from Eq. (32) we obtain the Rutherford
deﬂection function

θ(L) = 2 tan

−1(q1q2/v0L) .

Note that for charges of the same sign the scattering angle is positive, and for
opposite charges θ is negative (we take L and v0 as always positive).

When radiation damping is considered, E, L and A are no longer conserved.
In particular, from Eq. (27) we can show that the Runge-Lenz vector changes
at the rate

unperturbed Rutherford scattering. We obtain

reached by like-sign charges, and negative angles by oppositely charged particles.
We see that the radiative correction is limited if the Coulomb force is repulsive,
and is strongly divergent for backscattering (θ → −π) in an attractive Coulomb
ﬁeld.

the c−3 radiative corrections we have obtained. They were not considered here
because, as already mentioned, this would not change our results: a c−2 cor-
rection to the nonrelativistic Rutherford trajectory only adds c−5 terms to our
perturbative calculation of radiation damping. We can easily write the complete
(up to c−3) expansion of the deﬂection function and scattering cross section by
putting together the results of Ref. [7] and the present paper. For example, the
diﬀerential cross section to order c−3 reads

and M = m1 + m2. As discussed in [7], the ﬁrst corrective term accounts
for the variation of mass with velocity, and the second includes magnetic and
retardation eﬀects. The last one is the radiative correction calculated in the
previous section. It is interesting to note that magnetic and retardation eﬀects
simply renormalize the cross section by an angle independent factor.

In Fig. 4 we show the diﬀerential cross section for the scattering of a charged
particle with v0 = 0.4 c on a ﬁxed target, of equal (θ > 0) or opposite (θ < 0)
charge. The dotted lines give the nonrelativistic cross section, and the dashed

10

ones show the eﬀect of the c−2 relativistic mass correction (retardation and
magnetic forces do not show up on a ﬁxed target). The solid lines bring in the
radiation damping eﬀect, as given in Eq. (60). We see in Fig. 4 that radiation
damping has a very small eﬀect when the charges repel each other. But for
an attractive Coulomb force the radiative correction is quite important (as also
seen in Fig. 2), creating a plateau-like structure in the angular distribution.
Even though our perturbative results are not reliable for large corrections, such
structure is very similar to what is found in “exact” numerical calculations [6].
A ﬁnal point we wish to comment on is why our results are not plagued
by runaway solutions. The reason is that the Runge-Lenz based perturbative
calculation presented here follows essentially a “reduction of order” approach,
such as described in Refs. [2, 10]. This eﬀectively eliminates the additional
degrees of freedom introduced in the equations of motion by the time derivative
of acceleration, yielding only physically acceptable solutions.

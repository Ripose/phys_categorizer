Abstract

We analyze a simple problem in elasticity: the initial motion of an elastic bar that after being hanged

from an end is suddenly released. In a second problem a point mass is attached on the top of the bar. The

analytical solutions uncover some unexpected properties, which can be checked, with a digital camera or

camcorder, in an alternative setup in which a spring is substituted for the bar. The theoretical model and the

experiments are useful to understand the similarities and differences between the elastic properties of bar

and spring. Students can take advantage of the home experiments to improve their understanding of elastic

waves.

INTRODUCTION

“A thin long elastic bar is vertically suspended from one end by means of a string.

After the equilibrium is attained, the string is suddenly cut. Will all bar points have

the same acceleration just after the string is cut? —asks the teacher.

Yes sir —answers Peter— according to the equivalence principle all particles will fall

with the same acceleration in an homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld.

But I have read in the solution to problem 79 of B´ujovtsev’s book1 that although the

lower end will have acceleration g the upper end will fall faster —says Ann.

Of course —stresses Mary—, when we computed the tension in the equilibrium state

we saw that the tension is null in the lower end, so that only gravity will exert a

force on particles there, while the tension is maximum in the upper end, which will in

consequence have higher acceleration.

What do you think?”

When, some weeks ago, one of us proposed the previous question to our students we did not

suspect the full interest of the problem. Obviously the answers in the quotation are all wrong. The

equivalence principle only applies to free falling particles and in the problem there are also elastic

forces. On the other hand, g will be the acceleration of the center of mass: so it is not possible to

have an acceleration equal to g at the lower end and greater values everywhere else, as Ann and

Mary think. Our students found the problem highly unintuitive. It took some time to convince

them that although the tension in the upper end disappears when the string is cut, it will pass some

time before the tension and, as a consequence of Hooke’s law, the deformation change in other

points. The change of state will propagate along the bar in the form of an elastic wave, so that

initially the lower end does not move at all.

To help them understand the phenomenon we devised a simple experiment. We will show below

that the theoretical analysis in the case of a metallic bar is elementary, but the deformation would

be too small and change too fast to be seen, except maybe with some sophisticated experimental

setup. Instead we used a plastic spring2, which when stretched behaves much like the elastic bar,

but have elastic properties that change completely when the loops are in contact with each other.

In the spring deformations are large and change slowly enough to be recorded with a standard

digital camera, since most of them have the ability to record short video sequences. Although the

result of our ﬁrst try3 was not of good quality, one could easily see that the lower end did not start

2

falling until the deformation change reached it.

One could then think that if the center of mass moves with acceleration g while the points at

the lower end are still at rest, the upper points must move with high accelerations. We will see

in the following that this is not the case with the bar: what happens is something simpler but

(probably) less intuitive. In fact, one can go beyond the qualitative analysis and compute the full

evolution (from the string being cut to the deformation change reaching the lower end) with a

minimal mathematical apparatus, by using concepts available to students of introductory physics

courses. The analysis of Section II predicts that after the deformation change has reached a point

it will start moving with a velocity independent of position and time, i.e., without acceleration.

This unexpected result is a consequence of having assumed that the force exerted by the string

vanishes instantaneously, but one could expect it to be a good approximation in appropriate cases.

To check the theoretical prediction we went back to our video, extracted some consecutive frames

with a free tool4 and get something like Figure 1, where one can see that the upper end moves with

a more or less constant velocity, while the lower end remains at rest until the elastic wave reaches

this point.

However, as discussed in Section III, except for the ﬁrst frames in Figure 1, there was not

good agreement with the theoretical analysis because the upper coils quickly became completely

compressed and touched one another. The reason can be understood by using the theoretical

model: matter quickly moves faster than the elastic wave and the dynamical problem changes

completely (this new problem was discussed by Calkin5).

We then realized that we could get better agreement between the theory of elastic waves and

the experiment with the spring by modifying the problem by attaching a mass on top of bar and

spring. As described in Section IV, however small the mass is, some properties of the solution for

the bar change qualitatively, and not only quantitatively. This in turn allows to apply for longer

spans of time the theoretical model for the bar to the experimental setup with the spring.

II. THE FALLING BAR

In the following we will label each point P with the distance x measured from end A when the

bar is not strained, as shown in Figure 2 a).

A.

Initial equilibrium

For times t < 0 the bar is hung as shown in Figure 2 b), so that the distance AP is now x+u0(x)

in terms of the deformation ﬁeld u0. The tension τ0 is readily computed by writing the equilibrium

condition of P B and using the fact that tension vanishes at B: τ0(L) = 0. One gets

τ0(x) = ρg(L

x),

−

where ρ is the mass density. Hooke’s law and the boundary condition u0(0) = 0 allow computing

the deformation:

where E is Young’s modulus and c

E/ρ the speed of sound in the bar. We are assuming here

the unitary deformation ∂u0/∂x is small enough to satisfy Hooke’s law, which implies gL/c2 is

≡ q

small.

B.

Initial dynamics

At t = 0 the string is cut so that the tension at A disappears instantaneously, and a discontinuity

starts propagating along the bar with velocity c. It is easy to use Newton’s second law and Hooke’s

law to ﬁnd the wave equation satisﬁed by the deformation ﬁeld u(t, x), which gives the position

of P at any time, as depicted in Figure 2 c):

However, probably it will be easier for students to understand the calculation in a reference frame

falling with the center of mass, where the deformation ﬁeld will be

In such a frame the inertial force and weight cancel each other and the remaining forces are of

elastic origin, so that the longitudinal evolution equation is the homogeneous wave equation intro-

(Of course, this is the standard way of solving inhomogeneous linear equations, but the reasoning

here is more physical and can be presented to students before they study differential equations.)

For x > ct the perturbation has not reached the point, so that we have u∗ = u∗

we seek a piecewise solution as follows:

For x < ct we have a solution of (5) in terms of two functions, f and h, which is easily computed

by using the following two physical conditions:

We have, as expected, τ (t, 0) = τ (t, L) = 0 for all 0 < t < L/c. On the other hand, the tension

is discontinuous and becomes compression at the wavefront, and solution (12) at the lower end

x = L goes to

ρgL as t

L/c. This proves there must appear a reﬂected wave to make sure

−

τ (t, L) = 0 always; but we are not interested here in this reﬂected wave, for it cannot be seen in

our home experiment.

The surprise arises when one computes the velocity of each point:

All points outside the wavefront move without acceleration; but more and more points quit rest and

start moving with velocity gL/c (which, as stressed after (2), is smaller than c) as time increases,

so that the center of mass moves with increasing velocity gt. Put in other way, at the wavefront

x = ct the velocity is discontinuous and, in consequence, the acceleration inﬁnite. For students

knowing Dirac’s delta function —which can be easily introduced to physics students7— one can

write the acceleration in the following form:

∂2u
∂t2 = gL δ(x

(t < L/c).

(14)

We see now that the answer to the question proposed at the beginning of the introduction is that, in

the limit in which the string is cut instantaneously, initially all points move without acceleration,

except for those points lying at the wavefront, which have inﬁnite acceleration. This problem

illustrates a rather unusual way for a system of particles to gain more and more linear momentum

under an external force: it is enough to keep putting particles in motion, although all velocities are

equal and, more strikingly, constant.

III. THE FIRST EXPERIMENT

The theoretical analysis of the problem with an elastic bar can be carried out with elemen-

tary physics; in fact, it is enough to use the ﬁrst example of wave equation discussed in some

6

textbooks8. In our home experiment we needed bigger deformations and slower propagation ve-

locities, so we considered using instead a spring. The complete study of the latter is more difﬁcult:

deformations are no longer small, the elastic properties when stretched and under compression are

completely different, when hung from an end it stretches but also develops non negligible torsion

which changes when moving, transversal motion is likely to appear, and so on. However, one

could expect that at least some qualitative results (such as the points starting moving progressively

with constant velocity) would be the same as in the elastic bar.

Instead of an elastic bar we released a colorful plastic spring2 with some black tags stuck every

third loop. We used a digital camera9 to shoot a short video sequence at 30 frames per second.

The resulting animation is displayed (at two different speeds) in a web page10. One can clearly see

there that the tags and the lower end remain at rest for a while. To further explore the process, we

used a tool4 to extract some consecutive frames, which are displayed in Figure 1.

At ﬁrst sight one might conclude that the tagged points start moving all with the same constant

velocity only when the elastic wave reaches them, but a simple calculation shows disagreement

between theory and experiment: the upper coils quickly become completely compressed. Initially

the solution computed for the bar is approximately valid for the spring —and was computed in

this context, by means of a somewhat less elementary mathematical method by Calkin5 (see also

Cushing11)—: one only has to replace c by L

k/m, where m and k are respectively the mass and

q

the elastic constant of the spring. But, unlike in a metallic bar, in a soft spring the velocity gL/c

of the coils above the frontwave x = ct quickly become bigger that the velocity of the latter:

[ct + u(t, ct)] =

(15)

From t = c/g on (in fact, a bit earlier due to the ﬁnite thickness of the coils) an increasing number

of upper coils touch one another and fall over the coils below before there is time for the tension

to change there. We have then a kind of matter wave that moves faster than the elastic wave

created when the spring was released. The dynamical problem is then completely different and
was analyzed by Calkin5. One can check his solution in our case (l0 ≈
k/m

1,
4 s−2, in his notation): good numerical agreement is shown in Figure 3. This may be an

6.5 cm, ξ1 ≈

≈

interesting problem in dynamics of systems of particles, but we were more interested in elasticity,

so that we turned to the study of the problem in Section IV.

We can see that the solution (11) breaks at t = c/g (provided it is less than L/c, which would

7

never happen for an actual metallic bar) from another point of view. At that moment

∂

becomes negative at the wavefront x = ct, which is clearly impossible, for it would mean an

inversion of the spatial order of coils.

IV. THE FALLING BAR WITH AN ATTACHED POINTLIKE MASS

Let us consider again the bar of Figure 2 but let us assume in the upper end A there is attached

a pointlike mass M = µm. The analysis of Section II only changes from (9) on. In the latter we

now have to take into account the contribution from M:

This is a ﬁrst-order linear equation with constant coefﬁcients which can be solved, along with the

initial condition f (0) = 0, in a number of easy ways (integrating with respect to x after multiplying
it with e−x/µL or by using computer algebra, for instance) to give

ρgL, because of the attached mass, however small it is. For the same reason the points above the

frontwave are now accelerated:

provided it is real and less than L/c, as one can see by repeating the calculation in (16). One

can check that in the case of our spring this value increases with µ, so that one would expect our

analytical solution (20) to be valid for longer intervals with heavier masses.

Notice that when the elastic wave reaches a point its acceleration is g(1 + µ)/µ > g, and the

same happens initially at the upper end A.

V. THE SECOND AND THIRD EXPERIMENTS

This can be clearly seen in our second experiment12 where a thin wooden slab is ﬁxed at the

top end A. A thicker block is then put on top of it. When the spring is released, the acceleration

of A is greater than that of the block, which immediately splits up and follows the familiar free

fall trajectory, as displayed in the consecutive frames of Figure 4. One can see there that the

lightweight mass (µ

0.22) is enough to make sure the upper coils are also stretched for a while

and, in consequence, to avoid our continuous theoretical model break early because of the ﬁnite

thickness of the coils and the fact that the elastic properties of the spring change completely when

the coils touch one another.

This can be seen even better in our third experiment13, where the thin slab is replaced by a

thicker block (µ

2.35). One can clearly see in Figure 5 that each black tag starts moving only

when the stretching begins to change there, i.e., when the elastic waves reaches it. In the same

ﬁgure we have plotted the trajectories of the top most coil and the ﬁrst three tags as computed with

solution (20): one gets good agreement, despite the amateurish experiment and the differences

≈

≈

between bar and spring.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have analyzed, by using elementary physical concepts, a couple of problems in elasticity

with results difﬁcult to anticipate by pure intuition. To help students understand elastic waves one

can easily check the most striking aspects of the analytical results in an alternative setup, in which

the elastic bar is substituted by a spring, which allows far bigger deformations and slower wave

propagation. The similarities and differences between bar and spring can be used in an illustrative

discussion in introductory physics courses.

Since one only needs a digital camera (or a video camera) and some freeware to process the

video sequences, the experiments can be easily performed in the classroom and repeated at home

by the interested student.

One can take advantage of the widespread availability of digital cameras to visually check the

solution of other problems in mechanics. Let us only mention a well-known one: the free end of
35◦ is always accelerated faster

an articulated arm released from an angle below arcsin 1/√3

≈

than g14.

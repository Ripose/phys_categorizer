INTRODUCTION

Rayleigh Scattering [1] has always been invoked to ex-
plain the blueness of the sky. It is the process of scatter-
ing of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength
of the incident electromagnetic radiation. In this simple
experiment the wavelength dependence of the Rayleigh
scattering cross section is determined using a commer-
cially available spectrometer.

II. THEORY

Following Jackson [2] we shall treat the scattering of
radiation of frequency ω by a single nonrelativistic parti-
cle of mass m and charge e under a spherically symmetric,
linear restoring force mω2
0x. The equation of motion is
written as

m(¨x − τ

...x + ω2

0x) = F(t)

where the characteristic time is given by

τ =

e2
mc3

Adding a resistive term to the left hand side, our equation
becomes

¨x + Γ

′ ˙x − τ

...x + ω2

0x =

ǫE0e−iωt

where E0 is the electric ﬁeld and ǫ is the incident polar-
ization vector. The steady state solution is given by

where we have written the total decay constant or total
width as

The radiative decay constant is Γ = ω2

III. EXPERIMENT

The idea is to compare the spectrum of a blue sky
with that of the solar spectrum to ﬁnd out the scattering
cross section at each wavelength. However a direct solar
spectra could not be taken with the instrument at hand,
as it was sataurated even at the lowest allowed exposure
of 2ms. The lunar spectra which is very similar to the
solar spectra was used instead.

An AvaSpec-2048 Fiber Optic Spectrometer was used
to record the respective spectra and averaged over 10
readings and suitably dark subtracted.
It was ensured
that all counts in the region of interest, namely 400 to
700 nm, were above 1000. Since the data was averaged
over 10 cycles, it represents a photon count of more than
10000. Assuming Poisson noise, the fractional error at
each wavelength is less than 1 percent.

Evidently the sky spectra is bluer than the lunar spec-
tra. This blueness of the sky is supposedly due to
Rayleigh scattering by the atmosphere. We shall now
try to extract its wavelength dependence and see if it
matches with theory.

IV. DATA REDUCTION

Before any can conclusions can be drawn from the
graphs, care must be taken to analyze what each count
represents. The counts in the lunar spectra can be rep-
resented as

M (λ) = Constants × Ef f iciency(λ)
×Albedo(λ) × SolarSpectra(λ)

The counts in the sky spectra are on the other hand

S(λ) = Constants × Ef f iciency(λ)
×Rayleigh(λ) × SolarSpectra(λ)

We wish ﬁnd out the wavelength dependence of the
Rayleigh scattering cross section from this data. The
quantum eﬃciency of the detector and the solar spectra
can be eliminated by the simple process of taking a ratio
of the two spectra. The lunar albedo is approximately
constant over the wavelength region being studied. As
the Moon lacks an atmosphere, the average particle size
of the scatterers on the lunar surface is much larger than
incident wavelength.

We take logarithms to the base 10 of both spectra and
plot their diﬀerence against the logarithm of the wave-
length. The best ﬁt straight line is found to have a slope
of −3.8. The theoretical curve with a slope of −4.0 is

of the Rayleigh scattering cross section which is taught
in almost all undergraduate curricula.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The wavelength dependence of the Rayleigh scattering
cross section is seen to approximately match the λ−4 na-
ture predicted by theory. The experiment is suitable for
undergraduates and can be completed by taking a lunar
spectra one night and the sky spectra on the next morn-
ing. It provides a direct way of verifying the λ−4 nature

Abstract

We present an elementary discussion of two basic properties of angular displacements, namely,

the anticommutation of ﬁnite rotations, and the commutation of inﬁnitesimal rotations, and

show how commutation is achieved as the angular displacements get smaller and smaller.

Key words: Finite Rotations, Commutivity

PACS numbers: 01.55,46.01B

1 Introduction

Even though ﬁnite rotations can be represented by a magnitude (equal to the angle of rotation)

and a direction (that of the axis of rotation), they do not act like vectors.

In particular, ﬁnite

rotations do not commute: The summation of a number of ﬁnite rotations, not about the same

axis, is dependent on the order of addition.

The anticommutivity property of ﬁnite rotations is made clear in introductory texts by showing

that two successive ﬁnite rotations, when eﬀected in diﬀerent order, produce diﬀerent ﬁnal results

[1].

However, when rotations are small – indeed, inﬁnitesimal –, the combination of two or more indi-

vidual rotations is unique, regardless of the order they are brought about (This fact allows for the

deﬁnition of angular velocity as the time-derivative of an angular coordinate [2, p.675]).

Here we show how the order rotations are carried out becomes irrelevant – that is, rotations become

commutative – as the angles of rotation diminish.

In Fig. 1 we have represented two successive rotations of a rigid body. The ﬁrst rotation is around

the axis OZ through an angle φ, which takes OA into OB. For simplicity, we take the plane OAB

to be the horizontal XY plane. The second rotation is around the axis OX through an angle θ,

which takes OB into OC.
Since the angle between the axes OB and the axis of rotation OX is not 90◦, the plane OBC cuts

the plane XY at an angle. Let this angle be β, represented in Fig. 1 as the angle formed by the

sides PQ and QR of the triangle PQR.

After these two rotations, the initial point A is brought to the ﬁnal position C. This same ﬁnal

result can be accomplished by just one rotation through an angle (A, C) around an axis perpen-

dicular to both OB and OC.

To obtain a relation between the angles φ, θ, β and (A,C), we have drawn in Fig. 2 four triangles,

derived from Fig. 1, which are relevant to our analysis.

From the two right triangles OQP and OQR, we have the relations

The law of cosines applied to the triangles OPR and PQR yields

− 2(OP )(OQ) cos(A, C)

+ QR2

− 2(P Q)(QR) cos β.

Substituting for PQ and QR their values given in (1.1,1.2), Eq. (1.4) becomes

= OP 2

sin2 θ − 2(OP )(OR) sin φ sin θ cos β

On equating expressions (1.3) and (1.5) for PR, using (1.1,1.2), we get

cos(A, C) = cos φ cos θ + sin φ sin θ cos β

Now we eﬀect the rotations in the reverse order, taking the ﬁrst rotation around the axis OX

through an angle θ, followed by a rotation around the axis OZ through an angle φ. In this case, the

point A moves to the new ﬁnal position E, instead of C, as indicated in the sketch accompanying

Fig. 1. The same ﬁnal result can again be accomplished by just one rotation, now through an

angle (A, E) around an axis perpendicular to both OD and OE.

A moment’s reﬂection shows that the relation between the angles now is analogous to (1.6), with

no need to repeat the above procedure. The cosine of the angle (A, E) is given by cos(A, E) =
cos θ cos φ + sin θ sin φ cos β′, with the diﬀerence that β′ is the angle the plane AOD makes with the

horizontal plane DOE. Thus we have

cos(A, C) − cos(A, E) = sin φ sin θ(cos β − cos β′)

(1.7)

If we set β′ = β + ∆β, and expand cos β′ in (1.7) we get

cos(A, C) − cos(A, E) = sin φ sin θ[cos β(1 − cos ∆β) + sin β sin ∆β]

(1.8)

To see how commutivity is obtained when the angles involved are small, we use that, for x ≪ 1,

sin x ≈ x, cos x ≈ 1. Eq. (1.8) becomes

cos(A, C) − cos(A, E) ≈ φ θ ∆β sin β

(1.9)

This means that the diﬀerence between the two ﬁnal positions vanishes more rapidly than either

of the single rotations.

Remark: It is not necessary to assume that ∆β is small. Our result holds whether it is small or
not, since in (1.7) we could have simpliﬁed our analysis by using that | cos β − cos β′ |≤ 2, and

getting the same conclusion above.

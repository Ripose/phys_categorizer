Abstract

We discuss the existence and stability of circular orbits of a relativistic point particle moving in a central

force ﬁeld. The stability condition is somewhat more restrictive in Special Relativity. In the particular case

of attractive central force ﬁelds proportional to 1/rn, we ﬁnd the values the angular momentum may have

in circular orbits and show that, unlike in the non-relativistic limit, the latter are not always stable in Special

Relativity for 2 < n < 3.

INTRODUCTION

Recently Torkelsson [1] and Boyer [2] have considered the orbits in a Newtonian force ﬁeld
kr/r3 in the framework of Special Relativity. One of their results states that circular orbits

F =

−

only exist for L > k/c, while in Galilean mechanics they exist for all non-zero angular momenta.

At ﬁrst sight one could think that this is a restriction on the possibility to have relativistic circular

orbits. The ﬁrst goal of this note is to stress that it is not so, for there is exactly one circular orbit for

each radius r at which the force is attractive. In fact, the condition L > k/c arises as a consequence

of the interplay between the equation of motion and the deﬁnition of the angular momentum in

Special Relativity. We will also show that similar restrictions on the values of L (but not of r)

have to be satisﬁed by circular orbits in other central force ﬁelds. Finally we will discuss how the

familiar result [3] on the stability of circular orbits in non-relativistic force ﬁelds is changed by
kr/rn+1 for
Special Relativity. We check the stability condition with forces of the form F =

−

constant k > 0 and n, as well as with the Yukawa potential.

II. CIRCULAR ORBITS AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM

Let us consider a central force ﬁeld written as

F = F (r)

r

If a particle describes a circular orbit r = r0 its equation of motion is

By deﬁning the dimensionless quantity

one can check that the particle velocity and angular momentum are, respectively,

Since one can easily check from (4) that 0 < v < c (and that v increases monotonically with

µ), we conclude that there exists exactly one circular orbit for each radius r0 at which the force

perpendicular to the radius. But the fact that every radius is allowed does not necessarily mean

that every angular momentum is allowed.

In the non-relativistic limit, the angular momentum of all circular orbits is the same: L =

√km. In consequence, far more angular momentum values are allowed in the relativistic

case.

Case n > 3. The angular momentum is monotonically decreasing with r0. In consequence all

positive values of L are allowed.

III. STABILITY OF CIRCULAR ORBITS

If one uses the angular momentum conservation to eliminate from the equations of motion the

angular part, one obtains the equivalent one-dimensional problem. Alternatively one can use the

angular momentum

L = mγr2 ˙ϕ,

γ

1
≡  

−

˙r2 + r2 ˙ϕ2
c2

!

−1/2

to eliminate ˙ϕ from the total energy

and take the time derivative of the latter. In any case, the equation of the radial motion is

where we have deﬁned

E = mγc2 + V (r),

Unlike in the Galilean case, the right hand side of (15) depends on the velocity ˙r, so that strictly

speaking we do not have an effective potential (although a suitably generalization can be de-

ﬁned [1]). However, this will not be an obstacle in the following.

Circular orbits are given by the conditions r = r0 and ˙r = 0 and satisfy

To study the stability of the circular orbits, we will consider a very near orbit in the form

r = r0 + ǫ, with

, so that in the linear approximation the equation of motion reads

Since ˙r only appears in γr through its square, the last derivative in (21), which is proportional to

˙r, vanishes and the equation of motion reduces to

We are now in position to discuss the stability: if Λ > 0 the orbit will oscillate around the circular

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND COMMENTS

We have shown that in a central force ﬁeld there exists exactly one circular relativistic orbit for

each radius at which the force is attractive; but for F (r) =

k/rn with k > 0 and 2

n < 3

−

≤

the angular momentum has the lower bound given by (11). For n = 3 all L > √km are allowed,

while in the non-relativistic case we always have L = √km.

As for the stability of circular orbits, the results in the relativistic and non-relativistic cases are

the same for n

2 (stability) and for n

3 (instability); but for 2 < n < 3 relativity destroys

≤

≥

stability for any radius smaller than (27). It is worth mentioning that the Newtonian potential has

the greatest n for which all circular orbits are stable.

The last result suggests that relativistic corrections make more difﬁcult the stability of circular

orbits. In fact, if one considers the Yukawa (or Coulomb shielded) potential

the stability condition (24) reduces to

a2 + ar

r2 >

−

k

mc2a1/2 (a + r)3/2 e−r/a,

which is more restrictive that the non-relativistic condition [3]:

Something similar may happen in other cases, because if the relativistic condition (24) is satisﬁed

the non-relativistic (25) is also fulﬁlled, but the converse is not necessarily true due to the fact that

α0 < 1.

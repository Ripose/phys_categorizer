Abstract

A discussion of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics is presented at
a level which should be suitable for advanced high school students. This
is intended for those who wish to explore a version of mechanics beyond
the usual Newtonian treatment in high schools, but yet who do not have
advanced mathematical skills.

1 Introduction

Newtonian dynamics is usually taught in high school physics courses and
in college level freshman physics class [1]. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dy-
namics [2, 3] is usually reserved for an upper division undergraduate physics
course on classical dynamics. This is all as it should be, particularly since one
needs the technique of calculus of variations for the Lagrangian formulation.
However it is always nice to be able to whet the appetite of the advanced
high school student for a taste of things to come. For those students who
have successfully mastered the contents of the typical high school physics
course, one can give an extra lesson on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics
without having to use calculus of variations. The idea is simply to present
some new formulations of dynamics that an advanced high school student
will ﬁnd enjoyable and intellectually interesting. (The students can be told
that a rigorous formulation will be presented in college courses.)

For simplicity, consider only the one-dimensional problem. Write New-

ton’s equation

F = ma

(1)

and deﬁne the potential energy U(x), which is a function only of position, as

F ≡ −

dU
dx

1

(2)

dU

where −
Newton’s equation as

dx is the spatial derivative of the potential energy. Thus re-write

where ˙x ≡

dx

dt = v for the speed and ¨x ≡

d2x
dt2 = a for the acceleration.

−

dU
dx

= m¨x

2 Lagrangian Dynamics

To introduce Lagrangian dynamics deﬁne a Lagrangian as a function of the
two variables of position x and speed ˙x

L(x, ˙x) ≡ T ( ˙x) − U(x) =

1
2

m ˙x2

− U(x)

(4)

where the kinetic energy T ( ˙x) ≡
and the potential energy again is only a function of position U(x).

2 m ˙x2 is a function only of the speed variable

Now introduce the idea of a partial derivative. This is very easy. For a
function of a single variable f (y) the notation df
dy is used for the derivative.
For a function of two variables g(y, z) there are two possible derivatives for
each variable y or z. In this case one simply introduces a diﬀerent notation
for derivative, namely ∂g
∂y for the y derivative (where y is changing but z is
constant) and ∂g
∂z for the z derivative (where z is changing but y is constant).
Even though high school students won’t see partial derivatives until they are
in college, nevertheless the idea is very simple and can easily be explained to
the advanced student who is taking a course in calculus.

From (4) one can easily see that

and

∂L
∂x

= −

dU
dx

∂L
∂ ˙x

= m ˙x ≡ p

which is called the momentum p. Obviously then

d

dt   ∂L

∂ ˙x! = m¨x

(7)

Combining (5), (7) and (3), Newton’s equation (3) becomes

∂L
∂x

=

d

dt   ∂L
∂ ˙x!

(8)

which is the Euler-Lagrange equation in one dimension. It can be explained
to the students that it is this equation in Lagrangian dynamics which replaces
F = ma in Newtonian dynamics.

2.1 Lagrangian example

Students will obviously want to see some examples of how the Lagrangian
formulation works. A simple example is the one-dimensional harmonic oscil-
lator with

F ≡ −

= −kx.

dU
dx

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

Newton’s equation is

− kx = m¨x.

The potential U(x) is obtained by integrating (9) to give

Thus the Lagrangian is

giving

U(x) =

1
2

kx2.

L(x, ˙x) =

1
2

m ˙x2

−

1
2

kx2

∂L
∂x

= −kx

and substituting into (8) and (7) gives exactly back the same equation of
motion (10) as in the Newtonian case.

Many teachers will have had the students work out the equation of motion
from Newtonian dynamics for other types of forces, such as a particle in a
uniform gravitational ﬁeld. Students can be encouraged to prove that the
same equations of motion result from the Lagrangian formulation. Students
can also be encouraged to think about three-dimensional problems and to
derive, on their own, the three Euler-Lagrange equations (corresponding to

3

the three component equations Fx = m¨x, Fy = m¨y, Fz = m¨z) which result
from the three dimensional Lagrangian

L(x, y, z, ˙x, ˙y, ˙z) =

1
2

m( ˙x2 + ˙y 2 + ˙z2) − U(x, y, z).

(14)

3 Hamiltonian Dynamics

Now consider the Hamiltonian formulation of dynamics. Deﬁne a Hamilto-
nian as a function of the two variables, momentum p and position x,

H(p, x) ≡ p ˙x − L(x, ˙x)

(15)

1

−

which can be seen to be just the total energy T + U as H = p ˙x − L = m ˙x2
2 m ˙x2 + U = 1
L is not a function of p and therefore

2 m ˙x2 + U = T + U. Hamilton’s equations follow immediately.

∂H
∂p

= ˙x.

But L is a function of x and thus

∂H
∂x

= −

∂L
∂x

.

However (6) and (8) give ∂L

∂x = ˙p so that

−

∂H
∂x

= ˙p.

(16)

(17)

(18)

Equation (16) and (18) are Hamilton’s equations which replace F = ma in
Newtonian dynamics.

3.1 Hamiltonian example

For the harmonic oscillator example, the Hamiltonian is

H(p, x) = p ˙x −

1
2

m ˙x2 +

1
2

kx2 =

p2
2m

+

1
2

kx2

(19)

where we have had to replace ˙x by p
function of p and x only. Thus Hamilton’s equations (16) and (18) give

m because H(p, x) is supposed to be a

and

p
m

= ˙x

− kx = ˙p.

(20)

(21)

These are shown to give the equation of motion (10) by diﬀerentiating (20)
as

˙p
m

= ¨x

(22)

and substituting (21) for ˙p gives back equation (10).

Once again students can be encouraged to use other examples that they
have already studied in Newtonian dynamics and to show that Hamilton’s
equations result in the same equation of motion. Again students can work
out the three-dimensional generalization of Hamilton’s equations using

H(px, py, pz, x, y, z) = px ˙x + py ˙y + pz ˙z − L(x, y, z, ˙x, ˙y, ˙z).

(23)

Finally teachers can emphasize to students that Newtonian mechanics is
based on forces, whereas Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics is based on
energy.

In summary, a discussion of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics has
been presented which should be suitable for advanced high school students,
who are interested in exploring some topics not normally presented in the
high school physics curriculum. It is also hoped that this article can be given
to students to read on their own.

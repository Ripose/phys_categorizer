Abstract. We compare the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of and the self-magnetic
ﬂux through a current-carrying circular loop, with those obtained for current-carrying
polygons with the same perimeter. As the magnetic ﬁeld diverges at the position
of the wires, we compare the self-ﬂuxes utilizing several regularization procedures.
The calculation is best performed utilizing the vector potential, thus highlighting
its usefulness in practical applications. Our analysis answers some of the intuition
challenges students face when they encounter a related simple textbook example. These
results can be applied directly to the determination of mutual inductances in a variety
of situations.

1. Introduction

A common exercise in introductory physics courses concerns the comparison between
the magnetic ﬁelds due to two loops of equal length P , carrying the same current i, one
shaped into a square and the other shaped into a circle. One is asked to compare the
magnetic ﬁelds at the centers of the respective ﬁgures [1], ﬁnding that the ﬁeld at the
center of the square is larger than the ﬁeld at the center of the circle. In our classes,
this problem is always followed by a lively debate. Many students feel that the opposite
should occur, citing the fact that, for a given perimeter P , the circle is the ﬁgure with
the largest area. It is only when the two ﬁgures are drawn to scale, as in ﬁgure 1, that

they understand the result. The point is that, for equal perimeter, the sides of the
square lie inside the circle for most of the integration paths.

The result can be easily generalized for any polygon with n equal sides and total
perimeter P . ﬁgure 2, illustrates the case of n = 5. Each side has length sn = P/n,

Substituting for n = 3, 4, . . . in equation (1), we conclude that, for equal perimeter,
the ﬁeld at the center of a current-carrying triangle is the largest; and the ﬁelds at the
center of other current-carrying polygons with equal perimeter decrease as the number
of sides increases, approaching the asymptotic value of Bcenter
4πP 4π2 obtained for
the circle. This calculation can be assigned as a homework exercise.

Although the area does not play a role in this example, our students usually point
out that it should play a role in determining the auto-ﬂux through the wire loops. For a
An = P 2 cot (π/n)/(4n),
given perimeter P , the areas enclosed by the polygon wires are
Ac = P 2/(4π), as the number of sides increases. The

grows with n. Normalizing this type of “ﬂux” by µ0iP
, we
‡
ﬁnd 2.6, 2.8, 3.1, and π for n = 3, n = 4, n = 8, and the circle, respectively. This seems
to indicate that the smaller ﬁeld at the center of the circle is more than compensated
by its larger area. Some students interpret this as a vindication of their initial intuition.
Unfortunately, things are considerably more complicated than this simple argument
suggests, making it interesting to revisit this problem in an advanced course on
electromagnetism. Firstly, the magnetic ﬁeld varies from point to point in space. The
calculations of these magnetic ﬁelds may be found elsewhere for the polygon [2], for the
circular loop [3], and for planar wires [4]. Secondly, these ﬁelds diverge at the position of
the wires, meaning that some regularization must be used. Thirdly, obtaining the ﬂux
directly from the magnetic ﬁelds requires a two dimensional integration, which becomes
particularly diﬃcult in the case of polygons.

In this article, we start by calculating the vector potential A produced by a circular
or polygonal loop of perimeter P and carrying a current i, at any point in the plane of
the ﬁgure, inside the ﬁgure. Naturally, A and B =
A diverge as one approaches
the wire loop. So, we will consider the ﬂux of B through a surface S with edges on
a curve C similar to (and concentric with) the current loop, but scaled down by some
amount (c.f. ﬁgure 2(b)). Obtaining the ﬂux directly from B will require a further
two-dimensional integration (besides the one needed to obtain B), which, moreover, is
rather cumbersome in the case of polygonal surfaces. Fortunately, we may use Stokes

to turn the two-dimensional integration involving B into the one-dimensional integration
involving A. Many textbooks only mention the vector potential brieﬂy; this problem
provides a striking example of how useful the vector potential may be in practical
applications.

The results we obtain also provide the mutual inductance of two nested, coplanar,
and concentric (polygonal or circular) wires of equal shape but diﬀerent scales. This
can be used for theoretical discussions and experimental studies of Faraday’s law.

2. Calculating the vector potential

We wish to calculate An(x, y) at a point P with coordinates rP = x ˆex + y ˆey, as
illustrated in ﬁgure 2(a). We start by parametrizing the positions of the points on the
right-hand side of the polygon as r01 = dn ˆex + t ˆey, with t

3. Calculating the ﬂux

We recall two points mentioned in the introduction. Because the ﬁelds diverge at the
position of the wires, we will take the ﬂux in a curve similar to the original wire but
scaled down by some amount, as in ﬁgure 2(b). We may think of this as a cutoﬀ
introduced by the ﬁnite width of the wire, or as the situation faced in calculating the
ﬂux through a second loop, similar to (but smaller than) the current-carrying one. Also,
because the direct calculation of the ﬂux of B involves a two-dimensional integration,
we will use equation (3) and calculate instead the line integral of A.

The simplicity gained in utilizing A is particularly striking in the case of the circular
current loop, since equation (10) means that A is independent of θ. Therefore, choosing
an integration circle Cρ, of radius ρ

There is a subtlety concerning the fact that, since we have determined A(x, y, z) only for the plane
§
z = 0, we cannot perform the derivations with respect to z. However, these do not enter the calculation
of Bz(x, y, 0) which, by symmetry, is the only non-vanishing component of B(x, y, z) when z = 0.

where, in going to the second line, we have made ρ and R dimensionless by scaling
them by the perimeter P
. It is instructive to compare the trivial reasoning on the ﬁrst

line of equation (13) with what would be needed to calculate the ﬂux directly from the
ρ-dependent Bc.

Next we consider the magnetic ﬁeld produced by a polygon with perimeter P , n
equal sides, and carrying the current i. The distance from the center to each of the sides
is given by dn. Consider also a second n-sided polygon Cn whose sides lie a distance
(0, dn) from the same center. The ﬂux through this polygon is given by

Looking back at equation (6) one notices the need for integrals involving the logarithm
of rather complicated functions. Things can be greatly simpliﬁed, however. We start
by rescaling all distances by the perimeter P , thus rendering the variables x, y, sn, and
dn appearing in equation (6) dimensionless

We have checked equations (13) and (18) in two important limits. First, expanding
around xcut = 0, we ﬁnd that the ﬂuxes tend to the product of the magnetic ﬁeld at the
center with the area of a small central region whose distance to the sides is xcut. Indeed,
Φc →
Φn →
Here and henceforth (including in all ﬁgures), we normalize the ﬂuxes by µ0iP/(4π), the
magnetic ﬁelds by µ0i/(4πP ), and we continue to scale all distances by P . Naturally, we
can recover equation (20) from equation (21) in the limit of n going to inﬁnity. Second,
Φn tends to Φc as n goes to inﬁnity, for all values of xcut. This can be seen in ﬁgure 3,
which displays Φn for n = 3, 4, 8, and Φc as a function of xcut. Each ﬂux Φn diverges

at xcut = dn, while Φc diverges at xcut = R, providing a nontrivial crosscheck on our
expressions. Notice that, for each value of xcut < d3, the curve for Φc lies below all other
ﬂuxes. Although the ﬁelds B vary as one moves away from the center, a very rough
way of understanding this result is the following: the ﬁeld at the center Bcenter
decreases
as n increases—c.f. equation (1); on the other hand, for ﬁxed xcut, the areas through
which the ﬂux is being considered are given by n tan (π/n) x2
cut,
for Φc, which also decrease as n increases. Therefore, in this case the “area factors” do
not compensate for the smaller ﬁelds, as seen in equations (20) and (21).

Since the ﬂuxes diverge for xcut = dn, we may choose to consider another situation.
We take all wires to be of a ﬁxed width δ (in units of P ), and we regularize the ﬂuxes
by integrating only up to ρ = R
δ, for the polygons.
The results are displayed in ﬁgure 4 as a function of δ, for n = 3, 4, 8, and for the circle.
We notice the following features: i) for any ﬁnite value of δ, the auto-ﬂux increases as n
increases—this indicates that, here, the “area factor” is making up for the smaller value

of the magnetic ﬁeld at the center; ii) again, the curves of Φn tend to Φc as n increases;
iii) the ﬂux diverges as the width of the wires tends to zero, as expected.

Comparing ﬁgure 3 and ﬁgure 4 we notice that Φ decreases with n in the ﬁrst case,
while it increases with n in the second. So, in contrast to the previous case, here the
“area factor” compensates for the smaller ﬁelds. We can get a rough understanding
for ﬁxed δ, the areas through which the ﬂux is being

in units of P 2. As δ vanishes, the areas in equations (22) and (23) are
for Φc,
dominated by their ﬁrst terms, which do increase enough as to oﬀset the order of the
ﬁeld magnitudes. Of course, this is a very crude argument, since, because the ﬁelds
vary in diﬀerent ways as one moves away from the center, using Bcenter
in the reasoning
is a considerable source of error. Nevertheless, this rough argument is consistent with
ﬁgure 4.

n

One can show that, although the curve of Φc lies above those of Φn for δ

= 0, the
ratios Φn/Φc tend to one as δ approaches zero. This might be diﬃcult to guess initially,
since it seems to contradict the “area factor”, but it has an interesting interpretation in
terms of the line integral of A. For points very close to the wires, the ﬁeld approaches
that of an inﬁnite wire and A diverges logarithmically. Consequently, we may interpret
the result of the line integral as the product of a logarithmic divergence with the
perimeter P over which the integral is taken. Since these features are common to

(22)

(23)

6
Self-magnetic ﬂux of current-carrying polygons

9

all the current-carrying loops, all ratios approach unity. Of course, the same would not
be the case if we had taken current-carrying loops of diﬀerent perimeter (recall that we
have normalized all ﬂuxes by µ0iP/(4π)).

We can choose other regularizations besides the ones discussed above (constant
xcut and constant δ). For instance, we may ask that the surfaces through which the ﬂux
is being considered have the same area. In this case, as in the case of ﬁxed xcut, Φn
decreases as n increases. In contrast, if we ask that the surfaces through which the ﬂux
is being considered have the same perimeter, then Φn increases as n increases, as in the
case of ﬁxed δ. One can get a rough understanding for these features along the lines of
the analysis made above.

Finally, we recall that the line integrals of A have been performed over curves Cn
and Cρ identical to the current-carrying wires, but smaller. This is what one needs for
the calculation of the mutual inductance between two (polygonal or circular) current-
carrying wires of equal shape and diﬀerent scales that lie on the same plane and are
concentric. Our results apply directly to that case.

4. Conclusions

Motivated by a simple exercise in elementary electromagnetism, we have studied the
interplay between the magnetic ﬁelds and the areas of current-carrying polygonal
and circular wires of equal perimeter. We have calculated the vector potential
A for these situations, because its line integral provides a much simpler way of
computing the magnetic ﬂuxes; this example illustrates the usefulness of A in practical
calculations. Since the corresponding auto-ﬂuxes diverge, we have discussed a number
of regularizations, comparing the ﬂuxes in each case, and seeking intuitive arguments
for the results. As a bonus, our results can be applied directly to the calculation of
mutual inductances in a variety of situations.

We are very grateful to Ana C. Barroso for considerable help with some integrations, to
A. Nunes for reading and commenting on this manuscript, and to our students for their
prodding questions.

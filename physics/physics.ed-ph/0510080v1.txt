Student understanding of rotational and rolling motion concepts

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We investigated the common diﬃculties that students have with concepts related to rotational
and rolling motion covered in the introductory physics courses. We compared the performance of
calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics students with physics juniors who had learned
rotational and rolling motion concepts in an intermediate level mechanics course. Interviews were
conducted with six physics juniors and ten introductory students using demonstration-based tasks.
We also administered free-response and multiple-choice questions to a large number of students
enrolled in introductory physics courses, and interviewed six additional introductory students on
the test questions (during the test design phase). All students showed similar diﬃculties regardless
of their background, and higher mathematical sophistication did not seem to help acquire a deeper
understanding. We found that some diﬃculties were due to related diﬃculties with linear motion,
while others were tied speciﬁcally to the more intricate nature of rotational and rolling motion.

I.

INTRODUCTION

One of the goals of physics education research is to identify sources of student diﬃculties in learning physics and
to devise and assess novel curricula and pedagogy that may reduce the diﬃculties [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Investigation of
student diﬃculties related to various physics concepts is important for devising instructional strategies to reduce or
eliminate the problems. Previous investigations have documented diﬃculties in various introductory and advanced
physics courses [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], but only few examine the student understanding of rotational motion and notions
associated with it [11]. This study focuses on the diﬃculties in learning rotational and rolling motion concepts covered
in a typical introductory physics course. In particular, we investigate the understanding of torque, moment of inertia,
rotational energy, and rolling motion by interviewing students enrolled in the introductory calculus- and algebra-based
courses, and in a junior level classical mechanics course using Piagetian style demonstration-based tasks [12]. We
also compare the interview ﬁndings with response to the multiple-choice and free-response questions on these topics
administered to large introductory physics classes. In general, we found a good agreement between the ﬁndings of
the interviews and written tests, and the large population of students involved in the study (as described in Sec. II)
suggests that the diﬃculties related to rotational and rolling motion discussed here are common.

II. METHOD

Our investigation was composed of two parts. The ﬁrst consisted of demonstration-based interviews with individual
students (lasting about 60 minutes each), in which students were asked a set of questions about lecture-demonstration
based tasks. Once students made their initial predictions, they were asked to perform the demonstration and reconcile
any diﬀerences in their expectations and observation. We employed a “think-aloud” protocol [13] and asked students
to make explicit their thought processes verbally as they reasoned about the questions. We intervened minimally while
they were thinking aloud but prodded them to “keep talking” when they appeared to be reasoning silently. After
they had ﬁnished answering to their satisfaction, we asked further questions to clarify points that were not made
clear earlier. Since we were interested in understanding conceptual diﬃculties, qualitative reasoning was considered
suﬃcient. Think-aloud demonstration-based interviews were conducted with ten students enrolled in calculus- or
algebra-based introductory physics courses (typically science or engineering majors who had completed the part of
the course dealing with rotational and rolling motion concepts) and six physics juniors enrolled in a classical mechanics
course who had recently learned rotational and rolling motion using the Lagrangian formulation at the University of
Pittsburgh. All students were paid volunteers. Introductory students participating in the interviews received at least
a B grade in their physics midterm examination covering rotational and rolling motion concepts.

TABLE I: The diﬀerent concepts covered and the questions in the multiple-choice test that addressed them (see Appendix B).

Although interviews provide an excellent means for probing student reasoning and depth of understanding, they are
time consuming, and only a subset of students can be examined using this method. On the other hand, multiple choice
questions are easy to grade, compare, and analyze quantitatively, but the thought process may not be revealed as
clearly by the test answers alone. In particular, it is not easy to distinguish correct understanding from right answers
for wrong reasons or “recall” of concepts and formulas without understanding. However, well-designed multiple-choice
tests administered to a large group of students in conjunction with in-depth interviews of a subset of students can be an
eﬀective tool for understanding student diﬃculties. Thus, in the second part of our investigation, we designed several
free-response questions guided by the students’ performance in the demonstration-based interviews, and administered
them to students in introductory physics classes. After gaining further insight, we devised a multiple-choice test,
which required concise justiﬁcations for each answer. The design of the alternative answer choices in the test was
based upon the common diﬃculties that were identiﬁed in the interviews and free-response questions. The multiple-
choice test was not meant to be comprehensive and cover all topics involved with rolling and rotational motion, but
it focused on important concepts underlying the demonstration-based interview tasks (see Table I). We revised the
test in several iterations with the help of ﬁve faculty members at the University of Pittsburgh, while administering it
to students in several introductory physics courses and interviewing six introductory physics students individually on
the test questions. About 3000 students were involved in the entire study, including the period when test questions
were being revised. The item analysis was performed for every version of the test to assess how well the distractor
choices worked. The ﬁnal version of the multiple-choice test consisted of 30 questions, and it was administered to
652 students from seven calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics courses (including one honor class). The
reliability index α for the multiple-choice test for diﬀerent classes ranged from 0.68 to 0.82 (which is considered good
by the standards of test design [14]), and the point biserial discrimination coeﬃcients were between 0.2 and 0.7 for
all questions. Due to lack of class time, only 11 test questions were administered to 17 students in an intermediate
level mechanics class (included in Appendix B).

III. DEMONSTRATION-BASED INTERVIEW TASKS

In this section, we present the interview questions, and the concepts investigated through them. In the next sections,

we report on student responses to the interview and written questions.

The ﬁrst interview task was about a paper rotor or “helicopter” shown in Fig. 1 (the device was not referred to as
a rotor or helicopter during the initial prediction phase). Although the detailed physics of paper helicopter motion
could be complicated, students were only asked questions that could be answered based upon introductory physics
concepts. The interviewer held the paper helicopter vertically with its wings at approximately a 45◦ angle with respect
to the horizontal, and asked students to predict its motion if it were let go from rest. All students correctly predicted
that it would rotate as it fell down. Students were then asked to answer a series of questions assuming that the rotor
stayed rigid while falling. The list of questions and expected responses are presented in Appendix A. After the initial
predictions, students were asked to perform the demonstration and reconcile the diﬀerences between their predictions
and observations.

The second demonstration task posed during the interview involved a comparison of two identically shaped wheels
with the same radius R but with diﬀerent masses M1 and M2 uniformly spread at the rim. The wheels were suspended
on horizontal axles and could freely rotate about the axles. Students were asked to sketch and compare qualitatively
the graphs of the angular velocity ω as a function of time for both wheels when a small piece of putty of mass m was
attached to the rim of each wheel, as shown in Fig. 2. They were speciﬁcally asked to compare the period, T , and

of each wheel. A small piece of putty with mass m is attached to the rim of each wheel. The two systems are shown right after
the piece of putty is fastened to the rim.

the maximum angular speed, ωmax, in the two cases. They were told to assume that the axles were frictionless and
they should ignore air resistance.

We hoped that students would note that when the piece of putty was fastened to the wheel, its angular velocity
oscillated in time, and that the wheel with the larger moment of inertia had a longer period but a smaller ωmax. The
initial (maximum) torque is τ = mgR about a point on the central axis due to the piece of putty right after it is
attached to the rim as shown in Fig. 2. It causes the wheel to rotate (say) in the clockwise direction. As the piece
of putty goes down, the potential energy of the system consisting of the piece of putty, the wheel, and the Earth
decreases, while the rotational kinetic energy increases. At the lowest point, the magnitude of the angular velocity
reaches its maximum value ωmax. As the wheel continues to rotate clockwise, the sign of the torque (and angular
acceleration) becomes opposite to ω, so that the piece of putty rises up on the other side slowing down, until the kinetic
energy vanishes and the potential energy reaches the maximum value. At this point, the magnitudes of the torque and
the angular acceleration have their maximum values, and the wheel starts rotating in the counter-clockwise direction
(only now the sign of ω reverses). Although the maximum torque mgR is the same for both wheels, the wheel with
the larger mass at the rim has a larger moment of inertia and hence a smaller angular acceleration. Therefore the
maximum angular velocity of this wheel is smaller (and the period larger).

The third problem posed during the interviews consisted of predicting the motions of a rigid homogeneous sphere
and a cube released from rest on an inclined plane, and explaining the diﬀerent factors that aﬀect their motions
(see Fig. 3). After their initial responses, students were speciﬁcally asked to predict the inﬂuence of the angle of
inclination θ (if they had not already done so) and explain the role of friction on the motion, including the limiting
cases of inﬁnite and vanishing values for the coeﬃcient of static friction µs. We hoped that students would have
noticed that in general the sphere would roll without slipping down the inclined plane below a critical slope (identiﬁed
by the angle θc with respect to the horizontal), while it would slide for larger angles θ > θc. The value of θc depends
on the frictional coeﬃcient µs: the higher µs is, the larger θc becomes. In the limiting cases of negligible or extremely
high µs, the sphere would slide or roll (without slipping), respectively, for any angle θ ∈ (0◦, 90◦).

This result can be understood, e.g., by calculating the torque due to the frictional force about the center of the
sphere. In this case, the line of action of both the gravitational force and normal force pass through the center of
the sphere, and so they do not produce a torque about the center of the sphere (due to zero lever arms). The linear
acceleration a of a sphere rolling on an incline is a = g sin θ − (Fs/M ), where M is the mass of the sphere, and Fs
denotes the static frictional force, leading to rolling when tan θ < µs (which follows from the condition for not sliding,
i.e., g sin θ < gµs cos θ). The torque equation about the center of the sphere is given by τ = −FsR = Ioα, where R, α,
and Io represent the radius, angular acceleration, and moment of inertia (about an axis passing through the center)
of the sphere, respectively. For a rolling sphere, the linear and angular accelerations are related through a = αR, and
therefore it follows that Fs = −Ioa/R2 (which may be combined with the expression for a on the incline to solve for
α). Another way to think about the motion of the sphere is in terms of a torque about the point where the sphere
touches the inclined plane. For this choice, the lever arms for the frictional force and normal force are zero, and
the gravitational force provides the torque: τ = M gR sin θ = Iα, where I = Io + M R2 (thanks to the parallel-axis
theorem).

For a given µ, a rigid homogeneous cube will remain at rest below a critical angle and tumble at larger θ. In the
limit µ → 0, it would slide for all θ > 0, while for extremely large µ it would remain at rest for θ < 45◦ and tumble
for θ > 45◦. The tumbling of the cube can be understood, e.g., in terms of a torque due to the gravitational force
about a point on the edge of the cube touching the inclined surface at the lowest corner. For θ > 45◦, the center of
gravity is outside of the area of contact, so that the cube tumbles.

The last question posed was a standard textbook problem about a rigid wheel rolling without slipping on a horizontal
surface. Students were asked for the velocity of the top and bottom points at the rim of the wheel with respect to
the ground ~vpg, given that the velocity of the center of mass with respect to the ground was ~vcg. They were asked to
explain their reasoning. In order to answer this question, students had to understand the concept of relative motion
(~vpg = ~vpc + ~vcg). The bottom point of the wheel is at rest with respect to the ground as the wheel rolls because the
velocity of that point with respect to the center of mass ~vpc is equal and opposite to the velocity of the center of mass
with respect to the ground ~vcg. The velocity of the top point of the wheel with respect to the ground is 2~vcg because
~vpc = ~vcg for that point.

IV. STUDENT RESPONSE TO THE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

A somewhat surprising and discouraging result of our interviews is that no clear diﬀerence emerged in the perfor-
mance of students in the lower and upper level courses (though no honor student participated in the interviews); it is
interesting to note that a similar result emerged also from studies involving other topics (e.g., Ref. [15]). In general,
both groups of students had similar diﬃculties and were unsure about the same aspects of rotational and rolling mo-
tion concepts covered in the introductory physics courses. The higher mathematical sophistication employed in the
intermediate mechanics course appeared not to help physics juniors acquire a deeper understanding of the concepts
covered in the introductory courses. In all interview questions students were asked to start with a physical setup
related to lecture-demonstration tasks. It appeared diﬃcult for them to instantiate the “high-level” tools they had
learned in the upper-level course to those situations. The fact that many physics courses do not succeed in teaching
students to reason qualitatively about physical phenomena agrees with other ﬁndings [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Since there was
no clear diﬀerence in the performance of the introductory and advanced students, we do not identify their responses
to the interview questions separately in the discussions below.

Another thing to consider before analyzing the results of the interviews is that the teaching of rotational and rolling
motion in an introductory course follows that of linear motion. Therefore many of the previous diﬃculties with linear

5

motion compound with diﬃculties involved in learning the more complex concepts related speciﬁcally to rotational
and rolling motion. For example, we found conservation of energy and relative motion to be poorly understood
concepts that can be related to speciﬁc diﬃculties in understanding rotational and rolling motion.

A. Paper helicopter

Although all of the interviewed students predicted that the paper helicopter would start to rotate, only a few (less
than 20%) could explain why the helicopter, which was initially at rest, would start to rotate. Most students did
not use the concept of torque and talked about forces which “don’t balance” in order to produce a rotation as in the
following excerpt:

Student 1: ...forces with diﬀerent magnitudes will produce a net force causing rotation....

The dependence of rotational motion on various parameters was equally diﬃcult for them to explain. Most students
knew that air resistance (drag force) somehow played a role, but they often did not understand the direction in which
it acted and how it was aﬀecting the helicopter motion. Even when the helicopter wings were inclined at an angle θ
with respect to the horizontal, many believed that the drag force was completely vertical. Thus they were missing the
horizontal component needed to produce the torque. The following responses pertain to the following question by the
interviewer: “Can you tell me how the air-resistance force will act on these wings?” It was clear from the responses
that students had some notion that air resistance is important but they had diﬃculty articulating its eﬀect on the
motion of the helicopter.

Student 2: Air resistance always acts vertically...

Student 3: There’s an air coming around...air ﬂow...air resistance...
if there’s no air resistance then it
probably would not rotate... but if there’s air resistance, the air is moving around...and it makes it rotate,
because air resistance probably gives like...a force on this.
Interviewer: In which direction does this force act?
Student 3: There’s normal force perpendicular to this surface [referring to the wings] that pushes up, but
this other force like air or force of air...friction...something...that pushes down on this thing [pointing at
the helicopter] [...] I think that they’re equal but opposite forces, like Newton’s third law.

Student 4: Air resistance is kind of tricky thing.
Interviewer: Why is it a tricky thing?
Student 4: It’s a tricky thing because [it is] not really discussed [laughs], and from what I know it’s all
approximation... we don’t have good equations for air resistance.

The following quotes are typical student responses as they tried to explain why the paper helicopter started to

rotate when let go from rest:

[Shaping a piece of paper into a ball, and asking the student about its motion while it is

Interviewer:
falling down...]
Student 5: It will not rotate, it’ll just fall down.
Interviewer: Why?
Student 5: It has to do with...(pauses and thinks)...I’m not quite sure why.

Student 6: Can you say like...it’s in equilibrium when it falls, and like...in order to maintain equilibrium
it needs to rotate.

Student 7: You need like...an initial force?

B. Rotating wheels

For the second question posed, diﬃculties were often due to the inability to apply the principle of conservation of
energy. Several students could describe the rotation of a wheel with a piece of putty attached, but could not justify
their response properly. Even those who noted that the angular velocity of the wheel oscillated (when the piece of
putty was attached) did not invoke the conservation of energy to explain that the piece of putty had to reach the same
initial height on the other side (in the ideal frictionless case) before turning back. More “visual” concepts like speed
were easily recalled, but without invoking appropriate relations with directly related concepts (like kinetic energy).
The following discussion shows a student who thinks that the piece of putty can reach the same initial height, but
does not invoke the conservation of energy even when asked explicitly about the physical principle involved:

6

Student 8: On the way down it gains velocity...the velocity is at a maximum when it’s down here [pointing
at the lowest position], then it will lose velocity up to zero [pointing at the same initial height, but on the
opposite side of the wheel].
Interviewer: What guarantees that it will rise to the same height on the other side? Is there some principle
of physics that you can use to ﬁgure it out?
Student 8: Just that the velocity you gain on the way down would be canceled out by the acceleration
upward when it goes up.

A common diﬃculty in plotting the angular velocity of the wheels as a function of time was an oscillatory but
entirely positive curve, sometimes with sharp edges. These kinds of diﬃculties while describing a motion through
a graph are consistent with ﬁndings from other studies [16]. When probed explicitly about whether the sign of the
velocity depended on the direction of motion, most students re-drew the ω vs time curve correctly. Once students
made their prediction, they performed the demonstration involving the motion of the wheel with a piece of putty
attached. After this, one-fourth of the students tried to draw an analogy with the motion of a pendulum. While it
helped them understand qualitatively the oscillatory motion of the wheel with the piece of putty attached, it confused
them in comparing the behavior of the two wheels. In fact, they kept thinking of a simple pendulum (whose period
does not depend on the mass of the bob), and had diﬃculty realizing that this result would not apply to their problem.
In our investigation, we were also interested in ﬁnding out how much of a hint or assistance was required to guide
students through the reasoning. Therefore after the students had explained the observation to the best of their ability
while talking aloud, we gave them successive hints. We did not ﬁnd any clear diﬀerence between the introductory
and advanced students in terms of the amount of assistance required. In general, none of the students could compare
correctly the plots of the motion of the two wheels without hints—if they noted that there had to be a diﬀerence in
the period in the two cases, they did not correctly predict the angular speed in the two cases and vice versa. About
20% of the students claimed that nothing would be diﬀerent in the two cases. However, a few hints were enough to
drive about 80% of them through the correct reasoning.

Student 9: I think that [the plot for the other wheel] would be exactly the same.
Interviewer: Can you elaborate?
Student 9: Because, I mean, there’s no...no net force... it seems like the period and angular velocity will
be the same for both, I think.
Interviewer: So, the fact that the wheel is lighter will not change...
Student 9: No, it doesn’t matter at all.
Interviewer: Why?
Student 9: (thinks for some time) Maybe it will have one change. [...] I think the period will be the same,
but the amplitude may be higher... [changing his mind...] the period is diﬀerent!
Interviewer: Why do you think the period is diﬀerent now?
Student 9: The period is diﬀerent because...this one takes...if this one goes around faster, it seems like it
will get to that point at faster velocity. [...] hmmm... [murmuring “pendulum”] ...this is all related, like a
pendulum...
Interviewer: Why do you think of a pendulum?
Student 9: Oh, it seems like you’ve a pendulum going like this, and I think it doesn’t matter what mass
is on a pendulum.

Student 10: I guess the period would be diﬀerent [...] I’d say the angular velocity would be the same.
Interviewer: Earlier you said this [the lighter wheel] takes a shorter time to get up to here [the position
after half a period].
Student 10: Right.
Interviewer: So, if it takes a shorter time...
Student 10: Oh..the angular velocity is gonna be much larger for this wheel...

Many students talked about the diﬀerence in “mass” aﬀecting the angular speed of the wheels. At the end of the
demonstration interview, students were asked about how the angular velocities and periods would diﬀer if the masses
of the two objects were the same but the mass was distributed diﬀerently. Many did not use the concept of moment of
inertia correctly. Some said that they vaguely remember that the distribution of mass matters but did not remember
the exact relation. Student responses to the multiple-choice questions in the later section also attest to this diﬃculty.

C. Sphere and cube on an inclined plane

7

As for the third interview question, students were unsure about the role of friction in making a sphere roll and
a cube tumble down an inclined plane. Several students did not know the meaning of rolling without slipping even
though they had just had a midterm exam in which concepts related to rolling were covered. Some believed that the
object should roll better if there were no friction. Others believed that an extremely large coeﬃcient of static friction
would imply a Velcro-like eﬀect—i.e., no object would be allowed to move at all, even if the inclined plane were almost
vertical.

Student 11: If the coeﬃcient of friction is large enough, it won’t move, then. [...] As long as it is less than
90 degrees [referring to the angle between the inclined plane and the horizontal surface]—at 90 degrees
[...] Because the coeﬃcient of friction...you don’t deal with that after 90 degrees,
I think it would fall.
but like if it’s 89.99 [degrees] and the coeﬃcient of friction was inﬁnite, it seems like it still sticks there,
because there’s still something keeping it attached to it.

Many students did not diﬀerentiate between the concepts of force and torque, and had trouble with concepts such
as the axis of rotation, the lever arm, and the force involved in producing the torque for the tumbling motion. Less
than one-third of the students predicted the tumbling of the cube for large angles, but even those who predicted it
had diﬃculties in describing the cause of such a motion, and noted that their prediction was based only on intuition.
Others did not conceive the tumbling of the cube, and said that if the slope was high enough, the cube would start
sliding without rotating, no matter how large the friction was. After performing the demonstration and observing
what actually happened, students had diﬃculty in explaining the cause of the kind of motion observed. After several
successive hints and questioning, most of the students understood that a cube would tumble down for angles (between
the inclined surface and the horizontal plane) greater than 45◦.

D. Rolling wheel

The last question was the textbook example of the motion of a rigid wheel rolling without slipping on a horizontal
surface. None of the students were able to explain the velocity of the top and bottom points relative to the ground.
One student recalled from memory the correct values (i.e., 2v and 0, respectively), but could not explain the reason.
Interviews showed that the following diﬃculties precluded students from deriving the speed of the points on the top
and bottom of a rolling wheel with respect to the ground (despite repeated hints):

(i) They were not comfortable with (linear) relative motion concepts;

(ii) They did not understand the meaning of rolling without slipping (i.e., vcenter wheel = ωR).

Some students kept confusing the velocities of the top and bottom points relative to the center of mass of the wheel
with the velocities with respect to the ground:

Interviewer: What are the speeds of the points here and here [pointing at the top and bottom of the
wheel] [...] for a rolling wheel, with respect to the ground?
Student 12: With respect to the ground these points are moving at speed v and −v: this one is moving
at −v [pointing at one of the two points], this one is moving at v [pointing at the other point].

When students replied incorrectly, the interviewer tried to help their reasoning by giving successive hints. Occasionally,
even numerous hints and demonstrations were not enough to enable them to reach the correct conclusions. Students
were generally very uncomfortable with relative velocity concepts. They were so used to thinking in terms of one
preferred frame of reference that a diﬀerent reference frame represented a change of their acquired “common-sense.”
For example, in the excerpt below, after going through step by step reasoning for why the bottom of the wheel should
have zero velocity relative to the ground, a student was asked about the velocity of the top point with respect to the
ground:

Student 13: The top point...this point right here [pointing at the top of the wheel] is moving at speed v
with respect to the ground, and where it touches the ground is not moving at all.

After a demonstration and prodding by the interviewer whether they had noticed any blurring of the spokes in the
top and bottom parts in a rolling bicycle wheel, a student who did not diﬀerentiate the speeds of the top and center
of the wheel ﬁnally realized that those two points had diﬀerent speeds with respect to the ground, but could not
quantify how diﬀerent they were:

Student 14: Well, actually that [the top point of the wheel] moves faster [than the center of the wheel]—it
covers a larger angle of displacement, deﬁnitely [...]
Interviewer: How much faster is this moving?
Student 14: That speed is faster than v, I’d say...I can’t tell exactly.

V. RESPONSE TO MULTIPLE-CHOICE AND FREE-RESPONSE QUESTIONS

As described in Sec. II, we administered free-response and multiple-choice questions related to rotational and rolling
motion to about 3000 introductory physics students. The purpose was to evaluate the extent to which the interview
ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by a general student population. The ﬁnal version of the multiple-choice test is included in
Appendix B. The frequency of student responses for each of the ﬁve choices on each question is presented in Table II,
which includes the average response of 652 introductory students from seven diﬀerent courses (including one honor
class) who took the ﬁnal test version, along with the responses of 17 upper-level physics students to a subset of
11 questions from the same test. The introductory students were given 50 minutes to take the full test while the
upper-level physics students who were administered only 11 questions had 20 minutes to answer the questions. Both
in the introductory and upper-level courses, the test counted as part of the course grade, often in the form of a quiz.
The average test scores in nonhonor (introductory and upper-level) classes ranged from 44% to 61%, while a class of
93 freshman honor students (required to have a QPA of 3.5 or better) scored 75% on an average. We note that the
results for the correct answers listed in Table II represent only upper limits, because many students choosing correct
answers actually did not provide proper or satisfactory justiﬁcations for their choices.
Student responses and explanations of the test questions showed that students had common diﬃculties, which were
consistent with the ﬁndings of the individual interviews. Such diﬃculties could be classiﬁed into two categories: those
sharing a common ancestry with linear motion [17], and those that are uniquely related to the more instricate nature
of rotational motion. Table I broadly categorizes the concepts covered in each test question.

Moment of inertia. Student responses to the questions involving moment of inertia I showed that many students
were unsure about this concept. For example, many did not know that I is a function of the mass distribution about
an axis, and that the rotational kinetic energy depends on I and not just on the total mass. As shown in Table II, in
question (20), many students thought that I depended on the angular acceleration of the cylinder. Interviews showed
that this type of diﬃculty was partly due to students’ unfamiliarity with I. In particular, students would never claim
that, for linear motion, the mass of an object depended upon its acceleration. Student responses to questions related
to rotational kinetic energy showed that students had great diﬃculty with the exact dependence of the kinetic energy
on the moment of inertia and the angular speed of the object. The following were typical explanations from students:
“The larger the mass of a wheel is, the greater the rotational energy is.” “The lighter wheel has more rotational
kinetic energy... since it’s moving faster.”

Torque, angular acceleration and angular velocity. Students also shared common diﬃculties on questions related to
torque, angular acceleration and angular velocity similar to the ﬁndings of the interviews. The deﬁnition and meaning
of torque were unclear to many students and often replaced by the concept of force. Students were often unclear
about the concept of lever arm, and when asked explicitly in the test-based interviews, many considered torque and
force as equivalent concepts. For example, one student claimed the following about the situation in which two forces
were applied in opposite directions at the ends of a rod: “The net torque is zero, because the forces would cancel
out... canceled out by opposite forces.” This was consistent with several students’ written responses to questions
(9)–(12). Interviews also suggested that several students wanted to calculate the torque due to diﬀerent forces on a
rod about diﬀerent points (not all points were on the central axis). When the interviewer reminded students that
they were supposed to calculate the torque about a point on the axis passing through the center of the rod (and
perpendicular to it), some explicitly noted that they were not sure about why it would matter whether the torque
was calculated about a point on the central axis. Further questioning of some interviewed students showed that some
of them recalled that the net torque about any point is zero for a rigid object in equilibrium, and then claimed that
one can calculate the contribution to the net torque on a rigid object due to diﬀerent forces about diﬀerent points
(even if all those points were not on the same axis). Student responses to the paper helicopter problem during the
interview were similar to those identiﬁed in the written responses. However, students performed better on question
(13) than on the second problem posed in the demonstration interviews. For example, choice (c) was chosen by a
signiﬁcantly larger number of students than choice (b). This result was consistent with the reaction of students during
the interviews: when students were explicitly probed whether the angular velocity should always be positive, they
corrected their original drawings. Student responses to questions (22)–(30) showed that many of them had diﬃcultly
understanding that the net torque on the disk+clay system or the wheel+clay system about a point on the axle was
produced only by the weight of the clay. Student responses to question (30) showed that even when asked explicitly
to select an expression for the net torque on the wheel+clay system about a point on the axle, many students felt

9

that the mass of the wheel should also contribute to the net torque similar to their responses to previous questions.
Also, many students did not distinguish or establish a connection between the net torque and angular acceleration,
partly because they were not comfortable with the concept of moment of inertia. Although fewer students provided
the correct response to question (30) than several other questions between (22)–(29) which were based on the same
principle, those who answered (30) correctly mostly answered questions (22)–(29) correctly as well. Also, in multipart
questions, e.g., (22)–(24), students who answered the ﬁrst question about the net torque on the system about a point
on the axle correctly were signiﬁcantly more likely to answer the angular acceleration and the maximum angular
velocity questions correctly.

Question (5) revealed a common misconception related to linear motion, i.e., the assumption that the net force on
an object should be proportional to its velocity. Options (b) and (d) were the most common distractors. Students who
chose answer (b) had a similar misconception about the rotational motion. The “constant net force implies constant
velocity” (and vice versa) misconception became “constant net torque implies constant angular velocity.” The following
were typical explanations provided by students: “Using the fact that a constant force produces a constant velocity
and that torque is the angular version of force, then constant torque would produce constant angular velocity.” “If
there are torques that are constant, the angular velocity must be constant because the torque is moving it.” Students
who chose option (d) were confused whether the net torque was proportional to a change in velocity or change in
acceleration.

Relative motion. Similar to the interviews, many questions related to rolling motion probed student understanding
of relative motion concepts. Students had great diﬃculty distinguishing between the speeds of diﬀerent points on
a rigid wheel with respect to the center of the wheel or ground. Most students did not recognize that the bottom
point of a rolling wheel was at rest with respect to the ground. Typical responses from students included: “The
instantaneous velocity with respect to the ground is always tangent to the rolling circle.” and “The speed of all points
should be the same with respect to ground because they are all on the same wheel which is rolling.”

Rolling motion and friction. Many rolling motion questions also dealt with the condition for rolling and the roles
of friction and other parameters on the rolling motion. A large fraction of students had diﬃculty with these questions
and believed friction must slow any kind of motion (including rolling). In the test-based interviews, several students
speciﬁcally suggested that for a rolling wheel kinetic friction is relevant. They claimed that a constant force must
be applied to keep a wheel rolling, otherwise friction would slow it down. When students who were interviewed were
speciﬁcally reminded that the wheel was rigid and they should ignore air resistance, their response was unchanged.
Finally, responses to questions (18) and (19) about the motion of a cube on an inclined plane (with diﬀerent µs)
revealed results consistent with the interview ﬁndings described in the previous section.

Question (14) was the most diﬃcult question on the test for both introductory and upper-level students (apart from
the honor class). It showed that students had diﬃculties in determining the role of friction in rolling without slipping
of a rigid wheel on a rigid horizontal surface in the absence of air resistance. Responses of general introductory
students to questions (14) and (22) also showed that, unlike honor students, they had great diﬃculty in dealing with
idealized situations, e.g., considering objects as rigid, axles as frictionless, and ignoring air resistance [18].

VI. SUMMARY

Our investigation involving individual student interviews using demonstration-based tasks and written tests suggests
that students have many common diﬃculties about rotational and rolling motion concepts covered in the introductory
physics courses. Regardless of their level, students share diﬃculties with fundamental concepts such as torque, moment
of inertia, rotational energy, rolling, and the related role of friction. Some of the problems identiﬁed here propagate
from similar ones with linear motion, while others are due to the more intricate nature of rotational and rolling
motion. Many students acted as though they were applying rotational principles to real physical situations for the
ﬁrst time. They seemed uncomfortable in predicting the outcome of experiments and in reconciling the diﬀerences
between their initial predictions and observations by taking advantage of the tools they had learned. They in general
had diﬃculty applying the principle of conservation of energy and relative velocity concepts. Instructional strategies
that focus on improving student understanding of rotational and rolling motion concepts should take into account
these diﬃculties. The multiple-choice test that we have developed can help assess the eﬀectiveness of strategies to
improve student understanding of these concepts.

APPENDIX A: FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RIGID ROTOR AND THE QUALITATIVE
RESPONSES CONSIDERED ADEQUATE

(1) Can you explain why it will start to rotate when let go?

(2) Can you predict whether this particular rotor (shown to the student) will rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise?

Why?

(3) What will be the eﬀect of increasing the wing angle with respect to the horizontal keeping all the other parameters

ﬁxed? In particular, what will happen if the wings were completely vertical or horizontal and why?

(4) What will be the eﬀect of increasing the length of the wing for a ﬁxed angle keeping all the other parameters
ﬁxed (i.e., assume the total mass and moment of inertia of the rotor are not aﬀected signiﬁcantly)? Why?

(5) What will be the eﬀect of increasing the relative displacement of the two wings from the central vertical axis
laterally, keeping all the other parameters ﬁxed (students were shown with gesture what was meant by increasing
the lateral displacement of the two wings to make the question clear to them)? Why? In particular, how will
the motion change if the wings were not displaced with respect to the center?

(6) How will the magnitude of the linear downward acceleration of the rotor compare to the magnitude of acceleration

due to gravity, g? Why?

We hoped that students would have noticed that the air resistance or drag force, F , acted perpendicularly to the
wings, and since the wings were displaced, the horizontal component of F caused a torque about the central vertical
axis (but no net horizontal force) on the rotor, as shown in Fig. 1. This torque makes the helicopter rotate when let
go. The direction in which the helicopter rotates can be predicted by noting the direction of the net torque (inferred
from the way in which the wings are displaced).

The dependence of the torque on the wing angle (with respect to the horizontal) is nonmonotonic. In the extreme
case when the wings are completely vertical, the drag force perpendicular to the wing surfaces is negligible. On the
other hand, for perfectly horizontal wings the air resistance is maximized, but no horizontal component of the drag
force is generated. Hence in both cases the torque vanishes, while it reaches a maximum value for some intermediate
angle (which is not trivial to compute, considering that the terminal speed of the helicopter depends on the wing
angle too).

Keeping all the parameters ﬁxed, if the wings are made longer but the angle with the horizontal is kept ﬁxed, both
the vertical and horizontal components of the drag force increase due to an increase in the surface area. If changes
in the rotor mass and moment of inertia are negligible (i.e., most of the mass is distributed in the central part of
the rotor, and not in its wings), then a stronger torque leads to a larger terminal angular velocity (we note that
air resistance suppresses the angular acceleration rather quickly, at least for a paper rotor, and then the rotor falls
uniformly while rotating at constant ω).

The increase in the relative displacement of the two wings from the vertical central axis keeping all the other
parameters ﬁxed increases the torque due to an increase in the lever arm. In particular, if the wings are not displaced
with respect to the central axis, the horizontal components of the drag forces on the two wings are not displaced from
each other (the lever arm is zero about the central vertical axis) so that there is no torque to start the rotational
motion.

Finally, the vertical downward acceleration of the rotor is smaller than g because of the air resistance, the turbulences
created by the rotational motion, and the rotation of the rotor (in fact, the gravitational potential energy of the rotor-
Earth system as the rotor falls is not converted wholly to linear kinetic energy but also to rotational kinetic energy).
Once the terminal speed is reached, the vertical acceleration of the rotor becomes zero. If students mentioned any
one of the above qualitative reasons for why the vertical downward acceleration of the rotor was smaller than g, it
was considered suﬃcient.

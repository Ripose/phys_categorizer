ADDING PHYSICAL QUANTITIES
IN INTRODUCTORY PHYSICS

Abstract

In [3] we proposed a uniﬁed approach to addition of resistors and capacitors such
that the formulæ are always simply additive. This approach has the advantage of being
consistent with the intuition of students. To demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our approach,
we proposed some problems. In this companion to the original paper, we give the solutions
of the problems and we add new problems from diﬀerent areas of physics. We hope that
it can serve as a resource paper for problems on the subject.

1 Summary of the Approach

In [3], motivated by the fact that we have found no books in which end-of-chapter problems
using continuous versions of the equations

are given, we presented a new point of view in which only additive physical quantities are
used in the solution of problems. This approach, we believe, is straightforward and logical for
students and eliminates part of a student’s frustration arising from inappropriate handling of
the physical quantities. Students often forget the physical reasoning behind a problem and they
tend to add (integrate) quantities only in one way. However, physics contains much more than
mathematics and, when integrating quantities in physics, physical arguments are indispensable
as they dictate ‘the way we integrate’.

Our intention in this paper is three-fold. First of all, we would like to present the solutions
of the suggested problems given in the original paper [3]. Secondly, we would like to collect all
the basic formulæ in one place. Finally, we would like to present some additional results and
add some problems which can serve as examples of the eﬀectiveness of our approach.

2 Basic Formulæ

2.1 Resistance

The basic formula to compute resistance is the formula of a uniform cylindrical resistor:

where ρ is the resistivity of the material, L is the length of the conductor and A the cross-
sectional area. This, written as conductivity, is

where σ = 1/ρ is the conductivity of the material.

2.2 Capacitance

The basic formula to compute capacitance is that of a parallel-plate capacitor ﬁlled with a
uniform dielectric material:

where κ is the dielectric constant of the dielectric, A the area of the plates, and d the distance
between the plates. Seen as incapacitance, this formula becomes

2.3

Inductance

Calculation of inductance is usually based on the deﬁnition

and therefore some discussion is necessary regarding our point of view.
It is well-known that the inductance for a solenoid is given by

(4)

where N is the number of turns of the solenoid, A is the cross-section and L the length of the
solenoid. Seen as deductance

These expressions can be used as the basic formulæ when we compute the inductance of another
geometry which involves an inductor made from a single wire by twisting it in a particular
geometry and creating a number N of turns.

When we have some geometry in which no obvious way to count ‘turns’ exists, we must
use a diﬀerent formula. Clearly, the corresponding basic formula must come from a simple
geometry giving rise to a uniform magnetic ﬁeld.
In ﬁgure 1 we see an inductor with such
properties. The inductor consists of two ﬁnite-plane wires that carry opposite currents with
uniform linear current density. Due to the complete analogy with a parallel-plate capacitor, we
call it the parallel-plate inductor.

Figure 1: A parallel-plate inductor.

An inﬁnite sheet with uniform linear current density Js creates a uniform magnetic ﬁeld in
space with value B = µ0Js/2. The direction of the ﬁeld is found using the right-hand rule.
When two inﬁnite sheets are given, the total ﬁeld is the sum of two ﬁelds. Given the directions
of the currents of the parallel-plate inductor, the magnetic ﬁeld adds to zero outside the plates
and to B = µ0Js between the plates. Of course, in the case of ﬁnite plates this result is only
approximate, being a good approximation when d ≪ w. To compute the inductance of the
parallel-plate inductor, we must compute the ﬂux ΦB in the deﬁnition (3). We notice that the
magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular to the area A = Ld. In this case

and I = Jsw. Therefore

ΦB = B A = µ0JsLd

L =

.

Notice that the only diﬀerence is that the ‘solenoid’ is now made only from one turn, i.e. N = 1.
Therefore, in problems where the current is distributed continuously only ‘one turn’ should be
counted. This issue can cause to curious students considerable frustration since she can raise
the following objection: “In the calculation of the inductance, we concluded that N = 1 since
one ‘turn’ was used (incorrectly) in the computation of ﬂux, namely only the ﬂux through one
cross-section was used. However, there is an inﬁnite number of cross-sections and an integration
has to be done before inserting the ﬂux into equation (3). Therefore, the result is not correct.”
In this calculation, we believe that it is not easy to persuade the student that she is wrong and
no ﬂux has been lost. And unfortunately, similar situations arise in all continuous problems.
Books fall short in providing any answer to this question—they just present the solution. Our

3

method has the advantage, among others, that it answers this question in a satisfactory and
unambiguous way.
It shows explicitly that all ﬂux has been counted. This issue is easily
understood if the reader studies the problems of sections 3.12 and 3.13. Below, we present
an independent calculation to conﬁrm that the result found above for the inductance of the
parallel-plate inductor is correct.

The alternative calculation will be based on the energy stored in the inductor. The magnetic

energy density for the parallel-plate inductor is

The total energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld is then

However, for any inductor, the energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld is also given by U = LI 2/2.
When this is compared to the previous result, we conclude that

i.e. the same result as announced above.

2.4 Thermal Resistance

Imagine a cylinder made from a uniform conducting material whose bases are kept at diﬀerent
temperatures. Then, due to the temperature diﬀerence ∆T between the bases, heat will ﬂow
from one base to the other. The rate according to which heat is ﬂowing, i.e.

is called the thermal current. It is known, see for example [2, 9], that

where L is the length of the cylinder, A is its cross-section, and σth is a constant characteristic
of the material, called the thermal conductivity. We deﬁne the inverse of the thermal
conductivity ρth = 1/σth to be the thermal resistivity of the material. Equation (6) is
sometimes referred to as Fourier’s law for the ﬂow of energy.
The thermal resistance of the cylinder is then deﬁned by

Notice the analogy with the standard resistance: R = ∆V /I. Potential diﬀerence is the reason
electric current is ﬂowing. Here, temperature diﬀerence is the reason behind the thermal
current. Comparing the two formulæ (6) and (7) we have written above, we arrive at

an expression almost identical to that of the electric resistance for the cylinder.

We deﬁne the thermal conductivity as

2.5 Diﬀusion Resistance and Viscous Resistance

The thermal conductivity discussed in the last section is only a particular example from a more
general category of processes known as transport phenomena [2]. Transport phenomena are
irreversible processes that occur in systems that are not in statistical equilibrium.
In these
systems, there is a net transfer of energy, matter, or momentum. Fourier’s law stated in the
previous section was a law for the ﬂow of energy. We will write similar laws for the ﬂow of
matter and the ﬂow of momentum.

Imagine a cylinder ﬁlled with gas such that the particle densities n1 and n2 of the gas at
the bases are kept constant at diﬀerent values. Then, due to the density diﬀerence ∆n between
the bases, particles will ﬂow from one base to the other. The rate according to which particles
are ﬂowing, i.e.

is called the particle current. It is known, see for example [2], that

where L is the length of the cylinder, A is its cross-section, and σdif f is a constant characteristic
of the material called the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Another name, in the spirit of what we have
been discussing, would be diﬀusion conductivity. The inverse of σdif f , ρdif f = 1/σdif f , is
named the diﬀusion resistivity of the material. Equation (10) is sometimes referred to as
Fick’s law. The diﬀusive resistance of the cylinder is then deﬁned by

Idif f =

,

Idif f = σdif f A

Rdif f =

Its inverse gives the diﬀusive conductivity:

Now imagine that the thermal agitation (speed) of the molecules at the two bases of the
cylinder is diﬀerent. Then, due to the speed diﬀerence ∆v between the bases, momentum will
ﬂow from one base to the other. The rate according to which speed is ﬂowing, i.e.

is called the momentum current. It is known, see for example [2], that

where L is the length of the cylinder, A is its cross-section, and σvis is a constant characteristic
of the material called the coeﬃcient of viscosity. Another name, again in the spirit of what
we have been discussing, would be viscous conductivity. The inverse of σvis, ρvis = 1/σvis,
is the viscous resistivity of the material. The viscous resistance of the cylinder is then
deﬁned by

cases with the appropriate index changes.

where lf ree is the mean free path of the molecules, vave the average velocity of the molecules,
n the number of molecules per unit volume, m the mass of one molecule, and kB Boltzmann’s
constant. These expressions should be compared with that of the electric conductivity which
is more familiar:

where q is the charge of a carrier.

2.6 Elasticity

The concept of elasticity is more than a mere deﬁnition. The behavior of a rubber band or
the behavior of a rod or a cable under stress is basically analogous to that of many springs
connected together.

Let’s imagine a uniform rod of length L and cross-sectional area A. We focus on an in-
ﬁnitesimal piece of length dx at distance x from one base. If dξ is the inﬁnitesimal extension
of this piece under the force F (x), then Hooke’s law states that

where dℓ is the elasticity constant for the piece dx. We can write the above relation as

where λ = dℓ/dx is the elasticity per unit length and ǫ = dξ/dx is the extension of the system
per unit length, known as linear strain. It is known that approximately [2]

where A is the cross-section and Y is a constant characteristic of the material known as the
Young modulus. Combining the last expressions we conclude that

If λ is constant then

where L is the length of the system. The stiﬀness would be respectively:

We have thus obtained basic formulæ similar to those of resistors and capacitors that allow
the computation of k and ℓ in any geometry. Most probably these formulæ are well-known to
engineers, but they are not well-known among physicists. However, once written down, they
look familiar and natural.

Table 1: This table summarizes the additive physical quantities in the most common cases
encountered in introductory physics. The quantities that are not usually deﬁned in the in-
troductory books are the conductivity S = 1/R, the incapacitance D = 1/C, the deductance
K = 1/L, the elasticity constant ℓ = 1/k, and the the thermal conductivity S = 1/R. In the
last column, the index tr stands for transport and it should be interpreted as a generic name
for any of the three cases of thermal conductivity, diﬀusion, or viscosity.

3 Problems with Solutions

Before, we present the problems, we rush to say that in many of them the solution tacitly
assumes that the partition into inﬁnitesimal pieces obeys all necessary conditions such that the
pieces are really connected in series or in parallel. For example, the disks used in the partition
of the truncated cone are are assumed to be equipotential surfaces. This is of course not true,
as can be seen quite easily. If they were equipotential surfaces, then the electric ﬁeld lines would
be straight lines, parallel to the axis of the cone. However, this cannot be the case as, close to
the lateral surface of the cone, it would mean that the current goes through the lateral surface
and does not remain inside the resistor. Therefore, the disks are not equipotential surfaces. One
way out of this subtlety is to assume that the disks are approximate equipotential surfaces as
suggested in [10]. This is the attitude we adopt in this article as our intention is not to discuss
the validity of the partitions used in each problem, but to emphasize the uniﬁed description
of resistances and capacitances (and all other quantities presented in the previous section) as
additive quantities. A reader with serious interests in electricity is referred to the article of of
Romano and Price [7] where the conical resistor is studied. Once that article is understood,
the reader can attempt to generalize it to the rest of the problems of our article.

3.1 Spherical Capacitor

Re-derive the well-known expression for the capacitance of a spherical capacitor

(where a, b are the radii of the spheres with b > a) by partitioning it into inﬁnitesimal capacitors.

We partition the capacitor into spherical shells of thickness dr. The inﬁnitesimal shells are connected in

series and therefore their incapacitance is

3.5 Truncated-Cone Capacitor I

Show that this result reduces to that of a cylindrical capacitor for c = b. Also, show that it
agrees with the result of [3] for a parallel-plate capacitor with a = 0.

(b) Now, ﬁll the two bases with disks of radius a and argue that the capacitance of the
hollow truncated cone equals that of the truncated cone minus the capacitance of the parallel-
plate capacitor that we have removed. This means that the capacitance of the hollow truncated
cone should equal

series. Therefore

Apparently this result does not agree with that of part (a). The reason is subtle but easy to ﬁnd. The
superposition principle states that if a problem in electricity can be split in two other problems, then the solution
to the original problem is the sum of the solutions of the partial problems. But is our problem the exact sum of
the two partial ones?

3L’ Hospital’s rule states that: if limx→x0 f (x) = limx→x0 g(x) = 0 and the limit limx→x0 f ′(x)/g′(x) exists,

then limx→x0 f (x)/g(x) = limx→x0 f ′(x)/g′(x).

Let’s assume that each plate of the truncated cone has a charge of absolute value Q and constant charge

density equal to σ = Q/πb2 on the top plate and equal to σ′ = −Q/πc2 on the bottom plate.

Q splits into Q1 and Q2 on the plates of the hollow truncated cone and the cylinder, respectively, in

proportion to the areas of the plates.

Q2 = σ πa2.

On the top plate of the hollow truncated cone we have Q1 = σ π(b2 − a2) and on the top plate of the cylinder

On the bottom plate of the hollow truncated cone we have Q′

1 = σ′ π(c2 − a2) and on the top plate of the
cylinder Q′
2 are not −Q1 and −Q2 (except when b = c). The only way to ensure
this is to change the charge densities on the plates. But then the problem is not a simple addition of two other
problems.

3.6 Truncated-Cone Capacitor II

A capacitor with the shape of a hollow truncated cone is now formed from two ‘cylindrical’
shells. Find its capacitance C.

Solution
As in the previous problem, we partition the capacitor into inﬁnitesimal annuli. However, in this case they
behave as inﬁnitesimal cylindrical capacitors connected in series. The plates have radii a and r, and the height
is dz. Therefore

This does not agree with the result of part (a) since the sum of two partial problems is not the problem we are

3.12 Parallel-Plate Inductor

Split the parallel-plate inductor into convenient inﬁnitesimal inductors. Then make use of
equation (3) to again derive equation (5).

Solution
The inductor is split in parallel inﬁnitesimal slices as seen in ﬁgure 8. Each slice is similar to a turn of a

solenoid; it is carrying an inﬁnitesimal current dI = Jsdx. The inﬁnitesimal slices have a deductance of

3.13 Coaxial Inductor I

Think of a coaxial cable made of two cylindrical shells of radii a and b. If the cable has length
h, compute its inductance. (The currents are uniformly distributed along the cross-sections of
the wires.)
Solution
Standard Calculation: The standard computation found in introductory physics books (e.g. [10]) uses the

deﬁnition (3). The magnetic ﬁeld between the two cylinders can be easily found using Amp`ere’s law:

where r is the distance from the center. Then we take a cross-section between the two cylinders (seen in blue in
the left picture of ﬁgure 9). We split this cross-section into inﬁnitesimal strips of width dr that are penetrated
by inﬁnitesimal ﬂux

The total ﬂux through the whole cross-section is

Obviously the standard computation falls short of explaining why only one cross-section has been used and

no integration over the angular coordinate has been performed.

New Calculation I: Let’s partition the cable into inﬁnitesimal inductors with the shape of the wedge as seen
in the middle picture of ﬁgure 9. The angular span of each wedge is dφ and each plate carries current dI = I dφ
2π .
The wedges are connected in parralel.

Figure 9: A coaxial cable made from two cylindrical shells with radii a and b and height h. In

and therefore we recover the result of the previous solution. We now see why only the ﬂux of a single cross-section
should be included.

New Calculation II: The computation we presented in the previous paragraph was no shorter than the
standard one, as it also must compute the ﬂux for one cross-section. It only had the advantage of explaning
why the ﬂux of a single cross-section must be included. However, now we give a short calculation based on our
technique, by-passing the use of ﬂux and relying solely on the basic formula (5).

We partition the cable into inﬁnitesimal cylindrical shells seen in the right picture of ﬁgure 9 which behave
as parallel-plate inductors connected in series. The distance between the plates is dr, the length of each plate
is h, and the width of each plate is 2πr. Therefore

3.14 Coaxial Inductor II

In the coaxial inductor of the previous problem, imagine that the current is ﬂowing from the
inner cylindrical shell towards the outer shell. Compute the inductance of this conﬁguration of
this conﬁguration.

Solution
This is another problem that presents the power of our approach. Using the standard computations, students
would have great diﬃculty in solving this problem, as they must ﬁrst compute the magnetic ﬁeld. However, our
method reduces the problem to a an almost trivial calculation!

We again partition the cable into cylindrical shells of width dr. These are now inﬁnitesimal inductors that

are connected in parallel, each having a deductance

There is probably no need for additional problems. The reader has certainly uncovered the

in the case of a uniform cylinder of length L and cross-section A whose material is characterised
by the constant p.

In all cases of identical geometry, the results will be identical. In fact, in many instances
above we could have saved some computations but we avoided doing so in order to present the
big picture ﬁrst. Once the reader is aware of the global picture, she can easily use it to transfer
a result for a quantity P1 in some geometry to a quantity P2 in a similar geometry.

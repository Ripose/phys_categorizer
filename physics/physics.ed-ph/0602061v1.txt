Abstract. For some physics students, the concept of a particle travelling faster
than the speed of light holds endless fascination, and ˇCerenkov radiation is a visible
consequence of a charged particle travelling through a medium at locally superluminal
velocities. The Heaviside–Feynman equations for calculating the magnetic and
electric ﬁelds of a moving charge have been known for many decades, but it is
only recently that the computing power to plot the ﬁelds of such a particle has
become readily available for student use. This article investigates and illustrates the
calculation of Maxwell’s D ﬁeld in homogeneous isotropic media for arbitrary, including
superluminal, constant velocity, and uses the results as a basis for discussing energy
transfer in the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

1. Introduction

For any medium, the speed of light is also the speed of propagation of electromagnetic
waves within that medium — after all, light is simply an electromagnetic wave. But
what is the relationship between an electromagnetic wave and the electromagnetic ﬁeld
of a particle?

In answer to this, we consider the ﬁeld of a stationary charge in free space. The

ﬁeld of the charge q extends to inﬁnity and at distance r is simply given by

E =

1
4πε0

q
r2 ˆr.

t′ = t −

r
c

.

If, however, we consider the ﬁeld to be made up of an imaginary ﬂux originating at
the particle itself and travelling radially outwards with velocity c, we see that the ﬂux
present at distance r at time t will have originated at the particle at a time

When the particle is stationary, it is unnecessary to make this distinction as the point
from which the ﬁeld was emitted is the same as the point currently occupied by the
particle. When the particle is in motion, however, it becomes necessary to identify both
when and where the particle may have been located so as to give rise to the ﬁeld at a
particular point.

Let the particle follow an arbitrary path x(t). We may write the four-dimensional
co–ordinates of any point on this path in the form (x(t), t). We now wish to determine
the ﬁeld at point (x′, t′), which may or may not lie upon the path. In order for the ﬁeld
to have propagated here at speed c, it must have originated at a co–ordinate (x, t) such
that

|x′ − x| = c(t′ − t).

(3)
A value of (x(t), t) satisfying (3) is referred to as the retarded position of the particle
generating the ﬁeld at (x′, t′). For certain trajectories, such as superluminal motion,
there may be multiple retarded positions contributing to the ﬁeld at a given location.
These are combined using the principle of linear superposition.

So how do we determine the ﬁelds arising from the particle at the retarded position?
The particle is in motion, and may even be accelerating. Obviously the Coulomb ﬁeld is
not appropriate; the moving particle constitutes a current as well as an electric charge.

although also originally developed by Heaviside [1, p. 437], is usually attributed to
Richard Feynman [2, p. II-21-1]. They are related by

R · (1 − ˙x/c) #ret

Derivations of the above expressions may be found in advanced electromagnetics
textbooks such as Jackson [3].

Now let us extend our considerations to media other than vacuum.

In material
media, the values of ε, µ and refractive index n will generally diﬀer from those in
vacuum, and the medium may also be anisotropic. Furthermore, when a charge is in
relativistic motion the medium will appear to contract along the direction of travel, with
consequences for ε and µ. Thus even a medium which is isotropic at rest will appear
anisotropic to a moving charge.

Our calculations shall be performed in the rest frame of an isotropic medium.
However, by working with Maxwell’s D and H ﬁelds we take an approach more readily
extensible to the cases of moving and anisotropic media.

Because

and

D = εE

B = µH,

c′ =

c
n

,

ε and µ are eliminated from our equations and only the value of the refractive index
aﬀects our results. This alters the speed of propagation of ﬁeld modulations within the
medium,

and thus aﬀects the solutions for the retarded positions. The equations for the D and
H ﬁelds then become

Note that the c associated with each ∂

propagation time, but as a constant relating our units of measurement in temporal and
spatial dimensions. This is unaﬀected by a change of material medium.

2. Calculation of Retarded co–ordinates

Consider a particle travelling in a straight line parallel to the y–axis at constant velocity
v. We choose our co–ordinate system such that the direction of travel is along the x–axis
and wish to calculate the D ﬁeld magnitudes in the xy plane. If the particle is at y
co–ordinate y0 at time t0 then its equation of motion is given by

y = y0 + v(t − t0).

(14)
Suppose we wish to calculate the D ﬁeld at spatial co–ordinate (x′, y′, 0) at time t′.
We denote particle co–ordinates with unprimed characters and ﬁeld co–ordinates with
primed characters. As can be seen from ﬁgure 1, the following relationships hold:

R
c′ =

− t) =

′
(t
R2 = x′ 2 + (y′ − y)2

R n
c

Combining (14), (15) and (16), and choosing c = 1 and t0 = 0 for clarity, we obtain a
quadratic in y:

y2(n2v2 − 1) + y(2y0 + 2t′v − 2y′n2v2)
+ (x′ 2n2v2 + y′ 2n2v2 − t′ 2v2 − y2

0 − 2t′y0v) = 0.

In accordance with convention we discard solutions corresponding to advance potentials
(t > t′), using (14) to identify the time t corresponding to a given source solution y. For
subluminal particles in a single medium, one of the solutions will be advanced and the

other retarded. For superluminal particles, solutions will either be both advanced, both
retarded, or both imaginary, indicating that the ﬁeld has not yet reached this region.

Having identiﬁed the space–time co–ordinates of our retarded source(s), we can
now calculate the ﬁeld at (x′, y′, 0, t′) using (12). When this process is repeated for
multiple sets of co–ordinates (x′, y′, 0, t′), a plot of the ﬁeld may be built up. Figures 2–
4 demonstrate the results which may be obtained.

3. Results

To represent the ﬁeld of the particle, we have plotted contours of equal D ﬁeld
magnitude. This should not be confused with the plotting of electric or magnetic ﬁeld
lines. The reader may be familiar with the representation of a Coulomb ﬁeld undergoing
a Lorentz boost shown in ﬁgure 5. Why, then, is the ﬁeld plotted in ﬁgures 2 and 3 not

similarly symmetrical?

When the charge is placed in motion, it constitutes a ﬁnite current element and will
therefore generate a magnetic ﬁeld. The charge is moving, and hence distances to this
current element will vary with time. As they do, the magnetic ﬁeld will also vary with
time, inducing a further electric ﬁeld. This ﬁeld is opposed to the existing compressed
Coulomb ﬁeld in the regions marked ‘a’ in ﬁgure 5, and complements it in the regions
marked ‘b’, giving rise to the observed distortion in the ﬁeld contours. The magnitude of
this distortion is dependent on electromagnetic induction in accordance with Maxwell’s
equations, and hence depends on the speed of the particle relative to the speed of light
in vacuo. Hence less distortion is noted in ﬁgure 2 than in ﬁgure 3, despite the particle’s
speed being 0.9 times the speed of light in the local medium in each case.

In ﬁgure 4, the particle is now travelling superluminally and as a result continually
overtakes the leading edge of its propagating ﬁeld. Because of this, a shock front is built

up. It is this which is perceived as the ˇCerenkov radiation (see section 4). An analogy
which is often employed to illustrate this phenomenon is to imagine that as it travels,
the particle emits repeated pulses of electromagnetic radiation, expanding in shells as
shown in ﬁgure 6. While a useful aid to visualisation, this analogy breaks down when
applied to subluminal particles and regions lying within the ˇCerenkov cone. A more
complete explanation could be developed in which the ﬁeld constitutes the emission of
virtual photons in analogy with quantum ﬁeld theory, but lies outside the scope of this
article.

It is also interesting to see how these results relate to the time-reversal symmetry
of the Maxwell equations. Essentially, time reversal interchanges the advanced and
retarded potentials, and hence appropriately reverses the direction of the ˇCerenkov cone,
as would be expected if the direction of motion of the charge were reversed. This can
be contrasted with the Lorentz-contracted ﬁeld lines of ﬁgure 5, which are intrinsically
symmetric, and for which time reversal simply reverses the direction of travel of the
particle leaving the ﬁeld lines unchanged.

4. Discussion

4.1. Electromagnetic Radiation

As is clearly shown in ﬁgure 7, the shock cone constitutes a narrow region of
comparatively powerful electric and magnetic ﬁelds, giving rise to local concentrations
in ﬁeld energy. These regions of concentrated ﬁeld propagate outward with time. Of
course, a freely propagating energy-carrying wave in the electric and magnetic ﬁelds is
what we know as electromagnetic radiation, in this case visible light.

In allowing the particle to continue to pursue a constant velocity trajectory in our

calculations, we have neglected the eﬀects of this radiative energy loss.

4.2. Freedom to Propagate

What constitutes a freely propagating electromagnetic wave? In the above section we
identiﬁed the ﬁeld surge of the ˇCerenkov cone with electromagnetic radiation. But the

Figure 7. ’D’ ﬁeld of a superluminal particle (see also ﬁgure 4)

method used to generate these images makes no allowance for free packets of ﬁelds
propagating through space — the ﬁelds involved all originate directly from the moving
charge. Is it therefore appropriate to think of this wave as free in the same sense as we
think of photons being free?

The answer is yes. Although in particulate models photons are considered
as independent entities, and likewise in classical electromagnetics we often consider
sourceless, freely propagating plane waves, in practice there exists a charge at the end of
every photon or electromagnetic wave, of whose retarded ﬁelds it is in fact an extension.
This charge may be accelerating, jumping between atomic orbitals, or travelling through
an optically dense medium as seen here. Our ‘free wave’ is indeed free, in that its nature
and behaviour are unaﬀected by any subsequent actions of the originating charge: That
modulation in the local electromagnetic ﬁeld will continue to propagate out indeﬁnitely
at the local speed of light, even if the originating particle is subsequently somehow
destroyed.

4.3. Acoustic Shockwaves

As we have seen in section 3, ˇCerenkov radiation arises due to the formation of a
shockwave in a particle’s electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The analogous problem in

background oriented schlieren technique.

acoustics is the formation of shockwaves due to supersonic gas ﬂows over material bodies,
which continues to be of great importance in aeronautical engineering. In 1886 the ﬁrst
photographs of the bow shock of a supersonic projectile were created by the collaboration
of Mach, Salcher and Riegler [4], utilising a technique derived by Toepler in 1864, known
as the schlieren method. Related techniques continue to be in use to this day (ﬁgure 8).
Once again, the shock cone may be considered to be built up by superposition of
consecutive spherical wavefronts emitted by the source as it travels (ﬁgure 6). In this
case, the wavefronts are pressure waves within the surrounding medium. Diagrams
showing the construction of the shock cone in this manner were ﬁrst published by
Christian Doppler in 1842 [5], though it is after Mach that the cone is usually named,
in recognition of his later experimental work.

Introduction of factors such as viscosity and turbulent ﬂow lead to additional
behaviours not discussed in this article, and cause the study of ﬂuid dynamics and
acoustic shockwaves to be a complex and fascinating ﬁeld.

6. Conclusion

This paper has aimed to illustrate the behaviours of the ﬁelds of a moving charge in
an optically dense medium, including ˇCerenkov radiation. These behaviours are readily
simulated on a modern desktop computer, and demonstrate how the radiation of the
ˇCerenkov cone arises naturally from the ﬁelds of a superluminal charge. The concept of
a ‘free’ photon is discussed, in relation to its origin in the retarded ﬁeld of an electric
charge. It is explained how the existence of the photon arises as a result of the motion
of the charge, but that the subsequent behaviours of the charge and the photon, or ﬁeld
wave packet, are independent. Finally, an analogy is drawn between the formation of
the ˇCerenkov cone and the formation of the bow shock of a supersonic projectile, a topic
of vital importance and ongoing research in aeronautical engineering.

It is hoped that this exhibition of the interesting phenomenon of ˇCerenkov radiation
may stimulate the student to further self-guided learning, whether by developing upon
the theme of this article (for example, by simulating the ﬁelds of a particle pursuing an
arbitrary path, or adjacent to a medium of diﬀering refractive index) or by investigating
other speciﬁc radiative phenomena. For example, the Heaviside–Feynman equations
may be used to calculate the ﬁelds of an accelerating charge as found within a
radiating dipole antenna, or a synchrotron. An advanced student pursuing an interest
in astrophysics may wish to investigate the radiative consequences of a straight particle
path in curved space–time. There are many more interesting possibilities to explore.

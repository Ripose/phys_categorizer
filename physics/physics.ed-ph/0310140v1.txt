Easy steps through essential Hamiltonian dynamics are outlined, from
necessary deﬁnitions of Poisson brackets and canonical transformations, to
a quick proof that Hamiltonian evolution is made by canonical transforma-
tions, the quickest proof of Liouville’s theorem, and on to Poincare-Cartan
integral invariants and completely integrable dynamics, making room, pro-
viding tools, and setting the stage for more recent developments.

I. Introduction

At a few key points, my teaching of classical mechanics relies on calcu-
lations that I do diﬀerently from standard texts. Strung together with bits
of familiar material, they form an alternative route through Hamiltonian dy-
namics that I ﬁnd advantageous. It ﬁts more easily into a course that moves
from traditional to chaotic dynamics. This requires that I provide notes for
students. Here I describe points that may be helpful for teachers as well.
They supplement what I have found in the standard texts. I take care to
refer to the texts I have found most helpful and those that are closest to
what I do.

New developments in classical mechanics have given Hamiltonian
dynamics a new role in our teaching. It helps prepare us to work with the
methods and understand and appreciate the results of chaotic dynamics.1−4
To make room for new developments, we have to delete or reduce some
traditional topics. Hamiltonian dynamics involves an accumulated wealth of
mathematical development that can be shortened without sacriﬁcing either
the basic concepts or the results that illuminate contemporary work. We
do not need to know much about canonical transformations, for example,
or anything about their generating functions, to work with the canonical
transformations of Hamiltonian evolution. Using the way they depend on
time can be enough.

We can edit Hamiltonian dynamics for economy of expression and
aim it in directions of current interest. We can, if we choose, step lightly
over some traditional theory and save time for solving problems, or have
time to introduce modern geometrical views.1 Minimal steps through essen-
tial Hamiltonian dynamics are outlined here, from necessary deﬁnitions of
Poisson brackets and canonical transformations, to a quick proof that Hamil-
tonian evolution is made by canonical transformations, the quickest proof of
Liouville’s theorem, and on toward contemporary goals, to Poincare-Cartan
integral invariants, providing tools that can be used with surface-of-section
maps,5 and to completely integrable dynamics, setting the stage for use of
action-angle variables and discussion of the eﬀect of perturbations on reso-
nant and non-resonant tori and the KAM theorem.6 Generating functions
are particularly useful for proving that the transformation to action-angle
variables is canonical, but that is proved here simply by calculating Poisson
brackets. We do not need a power tool for this one job; we can do it by hand.

II. Poisson Brackets

We work with canonical coordinates q1, q2, ...qN and momenta p1, p2, ...pN .

The Poisson bracket is deﬁned by

[F, G] =

N

Xn=1 (cid:18)

∂F
∂qn

∂G
∂pn

− ∂F
∂pn

∂G
∂qn (cid:19)

(2.1)

for any two functions F and G of the canonical coordinates and momenta.
It is linear for both F and G . It is antisymmetric; [G, F ] is − [F, G] . These
It is an easy exercise to prove that the Posisson
properties are obvious.
bracket also satisﬁes the Jacobi identity

[[F, G] , H] + [[G, H] , F ] + [[H, F ] , G] = 0.

(2.2)

The canonical coordinates and momenta themselves have Poisson brackets

for m,n = 1,2, ... or N. Hamilton’s equations

[qm, qn] = 0 ,

[pm, pn] = 0

[qm, pn] = δmn

dqn

(2.3)

(2.4)

can be written as

,

= [pn, H] .

(2.5)

Indeed, Hamilton’s equations and the deﬁnition of the Poisson bracket imply
that for any function F of the canonical coordinates and momenta

dF

=

Xn=1 (cid:18)

∂F
∂qn

∂H

− ∂F

= [F, H] .

(2.6)

The Hamiltonian H is a function of the canonical coordinates and momenta
that may be diﬀerent for diﬀerent t; it may be a function of the qn, pn and t.

III. Canonical Transformations

The 2N-dimensional space of points speciﬁed by canonical coordinates
and momenta is called phase space. We consider changes of coordinates in
phase space. Let Qn,Pn, for n = 1,2,...,N, be functions of the qk,pk that
determine the qk,pk as functions of the Qn,Pn, so the Qn,Pn label the points
of phase space as well as the qk,pk . We say that the Qn,Pn are canonical
coordinates and momenta, and the transformation from the qk,pk to the
Qn,Pn is a canonical transformation, if

[Qm, Qn] = 0 ,

[Pm, Pn] = 0

[Qm, Pn] = δmn

(3.1)

for m,n = 1,2,...N. Then the Qn,Pn can be used in place of the qn,pn to
calculate Poisson brackets; for any functions F and G of the phase-space
variables,

[F, G] =

[Qm, Qn]

(

.

Hamilton’s equations are the same for the Qn,Pn as for the qn,pn. The Hamil-
tonian is the same thing written diﬀerently as a function of diﬀerent variables.
Conversely, if this is true for any Hamiltonian, the transformation from the
qk,pk to the Qn,Pn must be canonical; with (2.6) used to write the time
derivatives as Poisson brackets, Hamilton’s equations for the Qn,Pn give

[Qn, H] =

∂H
∂Pn

,

[Pn, H] = − ∂H
∂Qn

,

which imply (3.1) in the particular cases where H is Qm or Pm.

IV. Hamiltonian Evolution

When the dynamics is described by Hamilton’s equations, the evolu-
tion in time is made by canonical transformations. Let Qn and Pn be the
functions of the qk,pk and t that are the solutions of the equations of motion

speciﬁed by the boundary conditions

dQn
dt

= [Qn, H]

,

= [Pn, H]

dPn
dt

Qn(t = 0) = qn

, Pn(t = 0) = pn.

(4.1)

(4.2)

The canonical coordinates and momenta qn and pn at time zero evolve to
Qn,Pn at time t. If their sets of values are q and p at time zero, their values
at time t are Qn(q, p, t) and Pn(q, p, t).

Explicitly, when the Hamiltonian does not depend on time and the series

converges,

Qn = qn + t [qn, H] +

[[qn, H] , H]

2
t

1
2

... +

tk [... [qn, H] ..., H] + ...

(4.3)

k!

the bracket with H being taken k times in the term with tk ; this and the
corresponding formula for Pn do satisfy the equations of motion (4.1) and
the boundary conditions (4.2).

The Qn,Pn are canonical coordinates and momenta. The transformation
from the qn,pn to the Qn,Pn is a canonical transformation. We prove this by
showing that the Qn,Pn satisfy the bracket relations (3.1). Using the Jacobi
identity (2.2) , we get

d
dt

[Qm, Pn] = [[Qm, H] , Pn] + [Qm, [Pn, H]]

= [[Qm, Pn] , H] .

(4.4)

The Poisson bracket [Qm, Pn] must be the function of the qk,pk and t that is
the solution of this equation of motion speciﬁed by the boundary condition

[Qm, Pn] (t = 0) = [qm, qn] = δmn,

(4.5)

which is [Qm, Pn] = δmn. Explicitly, for a time-independent Hamiltonian,

[Qm, Pn] = [qm, pn] + t [[qm, pn] , H] + ... = δmn.

(4.6)

5

The other bracket relations (3.1) can be proved similarly.7

The notation used here distinguishes the coordinates and momenta
Qn, Pn at time t from the qn, pn at time zero. We will use this notation
again when it is helpful, to consider the coordinates and momenta at time
t as functions of the initial values. More often, since now we know that the
coordinates and momenta are equally canonical at each time, we will follow
the usual practice and work with canonical coordinates and momenta that
depend on time, as we did in writing Hamilton’s equations in Section II; this
will be indicated by absence of Qn, Pn.

V. Integral Invariants

A point in phase space marks a set of values for the canonical coordinates
and momenta. It moves through phase space as they change in time. The
character of this motion reﬂects the structure of the dynamics. Consider a set
of points that occupy a volume in phase space. If the dynamics is described
by Hamilton’s equations, the size of the volume the points occupy does not
change in time as the points move, even though its shape generally does.
This property of Hamiltonian dynamics is called Liouville’s theorem.

The proof is very simple.8 At any time, the time derivative of the volume is
the integral over the surface surrounding the volume of the normal component
of the velocity of the motion of the points on the surface. That is the integral
over the volume of the divergence of the velocity, which is zero, because for
Hamiltonian dynamics the divergence is

(5.1)

We see that this holds for a time-dependent Hamiltonian; the Hamiltonian
can be a diﬀerent function of the qk, pk at each time.

Finding quantities that do not change in time helps build a picture of
the dynamics. The volume of Liouville’s theorem is one. Others can be
constructed as integrals along curves.

Consider a curve of points in phase space. Let θ be a parameter that
measures location along the curve. The phase-space coordinates qn, pn of
points on the curve are functions of θ. As a point on the curve moves in time,

6

its phase-space coordinates change from qn(θ), pn(θ) at time zero to

Qn(q(θ), p(θ), t)

,

Pn(q(θ), p(θ), t)

(5.2)

and time t , where Qn and Pn are the solutions of the equations of motion
(4.1) that satisfy the boundary conditions (4.2). We write q for the set of qk
and p for the set of pk. The phase-space coordinates of the moving point
are functions of θ and t. We can let points at diﬀerent θ move for diﬀerent
intervals of time t. If we make the time interval zero at the ends of a curve
segment, the moved segment and the original segment will form a closed loop,
as shown in Figure 1. We can replace the original segment with another
moved curve to make a closed loop on which the phase-space coordinates
change as functions of both θ and t all the way around. In this way we can
generate any closed loop in phase space that surrounds an area of surface of
tracks of motion in time, an area of surface swept by a curve segment moving
in time.

For any such loop,

N

the integral being around the closed loop. We can see this from

This implies that when a closed loop in phase space is changed by letting
the points on it move for diﬀerent intervals of time, the integral around the
loop

(5.6)

(5.7)

N

(

is not changed. We can see this by letting our original curve be a closed
loop and letting the points on it move for diﬀerent intervals of time to form
a moved loop. Connecting the two loops along two closely adjacent tracks
of motion, as in Figure 2, yields a closed loop to which (5.3) applies.
It
surrounds a surface of tracks of motion, a surface swept by a curve moving in
time. Since the integrals in opposite directions along the two tracks of motion
cancel, the integrals in opposite directions around the two loops must cancel,
which means the integrals in the same direction around the two loops are the
same.

These results are important for surface-of-section maps.5 The quanti-
ties (5.7) that do not change in time are called Poincare-Cartan integral
invariants.9 When the Hdt term is absent, they are called Poincare integral
invariants.10 The Hdt term will be absent if there are no time diﬀerentials or
if H can be taken outside the integral. We will use (5.3) in the next section.

VI. Complete Integrability

A canonical transformation can make the equations of motion so simple
that their solutions become trivial. This is possible if the dynamics are
completely integrable. That means there are N constants of the motion,
which we call In with n running from 1 to N, that in addition to

which says they are constants, satisfy

[In, H] = 0

[Im, In] = 0

for m, n = 1, 2, ...N. It is assumed also that these In are functions of the
qk, pk that determine the pk as functions of the qn, In in a suﬃciently relevant
region of phase space, so the qn, In label those points of phase space as well
as the qk, pk.

These assumptions of complete integrability imply, as we will show, that
there are Qn for which the Qn, In are canonical coordinates and momenta.11
The Pn are the In. They are all constants of the motion. That means Hamil-
ton’s equations give

= −dPn
dt
Then H is a function only of the Pn and

∂H
∂Qn

= 0.

is a constant of the motion. The equations of motion are solved. The Pn
are constant in time. The Qn change at constant rates; they are linear func-
tions of time. Action-angle variables are a particular case of these canonical
coordinates and momenta Qn and In for completely integrable dynamics.

We will take two steps to prove that there are canonical coordinate part-
ners Qn for canonical momenta In. The ﬁrst step, needed to deﬁne the Qn,
is to show that there is a function S of the qn, In such that

It is an action integral. Let

We write q for the set of qn and I for the set of In. For each ﬁxed set of values
of the In, the integral gives S as a function of the qn. The integral is along
a path on the surface in phase space where the In are constant, starting at
the point where the q have values q0. To establish that S is well deﬁned, we
need to show that the integral is not changed by variations in the path.

We have described the motion in phase space generated by the Hamil-
tonian H for evolution in time. Now we consider also the motion that is
generated the same way when the Hamiltonian is replaced by one of the In
or a linear combination of the In. From the bracket relations (6.2) we see
that this motion does not change any of the Im. It stays on the surface in
phase space where the Im stay constant. The velocity vector for the motion
generated by In, the vector that points along the direction of the motion in
phase space and measures the rate of the motion with respect to a parameter
s along the curve of the motion, has components

(6.7)

We are assuming that the qn, In are coordinates for a region of phase space.
For each ﬁxed set of values of the qn, the In must be coordinates for an N-
dimensional space. They must vary in N diﬀerent directions. Their gradients
must be N linearly independent vectors. From (6.7), which relates the com-
ponents of the gradient of In to the components of the velocity vector for the
motion generated by In, we see that the N velocity vectors for the motions
generated by the In must be linearly independent. The velocity vectors for
the motions generated by the In and linear combinations of the In point in
all directions on the surface of constant Im.

Now we can prove that the integral (6.6) is not changed by variations in
the path on the surface of constant Im. If an inﬁnitesimal segment of the path
is moved on the surface of constant Im, the moved segment and the original
segment form a closed loop, as in Figure 1. Now the motion is generated
by a linear combination of the In instead of H. We can use (5.3) with this
replacement. The Hdt term becomes zero, because the linear combination
of the In is a constant that can be taken out of the integral, and the change

in the parameter t or s around the closed loop is zero. Therefore

for the closed loop, which means the integral (6.6) is the same for the new
path as for the old. We conclude that S is well deﬁned. It clearly satisﬁes
(6.5).

That allows us to deﬁne the Qn. Let

The ﬁnal step is to show that the Qn and In are canonical coordinates and
momenta, that the bracket relations (3.1) are satisﬁed with In for Pn and
these Qn.

Using (6.2), (6.5) and (6.9) and taking partial derivatives of S, the Qn
and the pn with respect to the qk, Ik and partial derivatives of the In with
respect to the qk, pk, we get

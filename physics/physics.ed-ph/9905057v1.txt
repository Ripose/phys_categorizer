A Piecewise-Conserved Constant of Motion for a Dissipative System

(July 30, 2013)

We discuss a piecewise-conserved constant of motion for a simple dissipative oscillatory mechani-
cal system. The system is a harmonic oscillator with sliding (dry) friction. The piecewise-conserved
constant of motion corresponds to the time average of the energy of the system during one half-
period of the motion, and changes abruptly at the turning points of the motion. At late times the
piecewise-conserved constant of motion degenerates to a constant of motion in the usual sense.

I. INTRODUCTION

Finding constants of motion is an important step in the solution of many problems of Physics, as they allow to reduce
the number of the degrees of freedom of the problem. Constants of motion are intimately related to conservation
laws or symmetries of the system. For example, it is well known that a symmetry of the Lagrangian of a system
is responsible, by virtue of Noether’s theorem, to a constant of motion [1]. By deﬁnition, a constant of motion
preserves its value during the evolution of the system. Even in cases where there are no constants of motion, one
could still sometimes ﬁnd adiabatic invariants, which generalise the concept of a constant of motion to systems with
slowly-varying parameters. It turns out, however, that there are cases where there are constants of motion, which
are only piecewise-conserved. Well-known examples of such piecewise-conserved constants of motion arise from the
generalisation of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector for general central potentials. For example, in the case of the three-
dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the Fradkin vector [2] (which generalises the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector)
abruptly reverses its direction (although preserves its magnitude) during a full period [3] (see also [4]). (The Fradkin
vector directs toward the perigee, and the position of the perigee jumps discontinuously whenever the particle passes
through the apogee.) Also, in the truncated Kepler problem, the Peres-Serebrennikov-Shabad vector abruptly changes
its direction whenever the particle in motion passes through the periastron [5,6]. Again, it is just the direction of the
conserved vector which is only piecewise-conserved: the magnitude of the vector remains a constant of motion in the
original meaning (namely, the magnitude has a ﬁxed value throughout the motion). Piecewise-conserved constants
of motion may also be relevant for systems which involve radiation reaction. In the above examples, the piecewise-
conserved constants of motion appear in non-dissipative systems, and result from a discontinuity of the force (as in
the truncated Kepler problem) or from geometrical considerations (as in the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic
oscillator case). These piecewise-conserved constants of motion involve vectors rather than scalars, which still conserve
their magnitude.

The following question arises: Can one ﬁnd, for elementary systems, piecewise-conserved constants of motion? In
what follows, we shall discuss an elementary piecewise-conserved scalar constant of motion, for a simple oscillatory
mechanical model which involves dissipation in the form of sliding (dry) friction. Although dry friction is more nearly
descriptive of everyday macroscopic motion in inviscid media, it is usually ignored in elementary mechanics courses
and textbooks, which very frequently discuss viscous friction (which is velocity dependent). Dry friction exhibits,
however, some very interesting features and can be readily presented in the laboratory or classroom demonstration.
The problem of a harmonic oscillator damped by dry friction was considered by several authors. Lapidus analised
this problem for equal coeﬃcients of static and kinetic friction, and found the position where the oscillator comes to
rest [7]. Hudson and Finfgeld were able to ﬁnd the general solution of the equation of motion [8]. However, they again
assumed equal coeﬃcients of static and kinetic friction, and used the Laplace transform technique, which is unknown
to students of elementary mechanics courses, to generate the solution. An elementary solution, which ignores static
friction, was derived by Barratt and Strobel [9]. This solution is based on solving separately for each half cycle of the
motion, and is consequently tedious and unappealing. Recently, Zonetti et al. [10] considered the related problem of
both dry and viscous friction for a pendulum, but did not oﬀer a full analytic solution for the motion.

In this work, we ﬁnd the general solution for the motion taking into account both static and kinetic friction, using
elementary techniques which are available for students of elementary courses of mechanics. We analyse the solution
using a piece-wise conserved constant of motion. The discussion, as well as the corresponding laboratory experiment
of classroom demonstration, are suitable for a basic course for physics or engineering students.

II. ELEMENTARY DISCUSSION

Let a block of mass M be placed on a horizontal surface, such that the coeﬃcients of static and kinetic friction are
µs and µk, respectively. The block is attached to a linear spring with spring constant k (for both compression and
extension), such that initially the spring is stretched from its equilibrium length by ℓ, and the block is kept at rest
at x = ℓ. At time t = 0 the block is released. If kℓ > µsM g, g being the gravitational acceleration, the block would
start to accelerate. We take the friction to be small, namely µs,k ≪ ℓk/(M g), and also assume slow motion, such
that the friction force is independent of the speed. Namely, we neglect eﬀects such as air-resistance, and include only
the force which results from the block touching the surface. We also neglect any variation of µk with the speed.

Immediately after the block starts accelerating, its motion is governed by the equation of motion

M ¨x = −kx + µkM g,

with initial conditions x(0) = ℓ and ˙x(0) = 0. From now on, let us introduce the frequency ω2 = k/M . Of course, the
system does not preserve its energy, due to the friction force. However, let us deﬁne a new coordinate x′ = x− µkg/ω2.
Equation (1) then becomes ¨x′ + ω2x′ = 0. For this equation we know that there is a constant of motion, namely
2 M ω2x′2. Therefore, despite the presence of friction, one can still ﬁnd a constant of motion, which
E = 1
has the functional form of the total mechanical energy, but which is of course not the energy, as the latter is not
conserved. Calculating its numerical value we ﬁnd that E0 = 1

2 M ˙x′2

.

At the time t = π/ω the velocity of the block vanishes, and it can be easily shown that at t = π/ω its acceleration
is ¨x(π/ω) = (ℓ − µkg/ω2)ω2 > 0, such that the block reverses its motion. (We assume here that M ¨x(π/ω) > µsM g.)
The nature of the friction force is that its direction is always opposite to the direction of motion. Consequently, the
equation of motion now changes to

(cid:1)

2 M ω2

ℓ − µkg/ω2
(cid:0)

M ¨x = −kx − µkM g,

with initial conditions x(π/ω) = ℓ − 2µkg/ω2 and ˙x(π/ω) = 0. One can again solve this equation readily. This time,
let us deﬁne x′ = x + µkg/ω2. Equation (2) again becomes ¨x′ + ω2x′ = 0, such that E is still conserved. However,
this time the numerical value of E, which we denote by E1 6= E0, and we ﬁnd E1 = 1
. One can
describe the next phases of the motion similarly. During each phase of the motion (during half a period between two
times at which the velocity vanishes) E, if deﬁned properly, is conserved. However, E is only piecewise-conserved,
as its value changes abruptly from phase to phase. We note that the period of the oscillations is not altered by the
presence of friction, and denote by P1/2 half that period. Namely, P1/2 ≡ π/ω.

Let us now discuss the system in a more general way. It turns out that although there are friction forces, one can

still write a hamiltonian

where f (t) = (−1)[t/P1/2]µkM g. The equation of motion is now

¨x + ω2x = f (t)/M

with the initial conditions being (as before) x(0) = ℓ and ˙x(0) = 0. We denote by square brackets of some argument
the largest integer smaller than or equal to the argument. We also assume that the static friction force at the turning
points of the motion is smaller than the elastic force of the spring, such that the motion does not stop. (Of course, for
large enough time, this would not be true any more, and the block would eventually stop—see below.) Let us deﬁne
the (complex) variable ξ ≡ ˙x + iωx [11], where i2 = −1. Then, instead of a real second order equation (such as Eq.
(3)), one obtains a complex ﬁrst order equation. It is advantageous to do this, because there is a general solution for
any inhomogeneous linear ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation in terms of quadratures. Substituting the deﬁnition for ξ
in Eq. (3) we ﬁnd that the equation of motion, in terms of ξ, takes the form

After ﬁnding the solution ξ(t) we can ﬁnd x(t) and ˙x(t) by ˙x(t) = (ξ(t) + ξ∗(t))/2 and x(t) = (ξ(t) − ξ∗(t))/(2i). We
denote by a star complex conjugation. In order to integrate Eq. (5) we ﬁnd it convenient to separate the discussion
to two cases: case (a) where

(cid:3)
contributions. Integrating term by term we ﬁnd

An interesting property of the solution given by Eqs. (12) and (13) is that for each half cycle it looks as if the motion
were that of a simple harmonic oscillator, with no friction. In fact, the eﬀect of the friction for each half cycle enters
only in the initial conditions for that half cycle, or, more accurately, in the smaller value for the initial position for
the half cycle. In addition, it is evident from Eq. (12) that the damping of the amplitude of the oscillation is linear
in the time t, whereas in disspative systems in which the resistance is speed-dependent the damping is exponential in
the time.

Substituting the expressions for x′(t) and ˙x′(t) in E, we ﬁnd that

It is clear that E is not a constant of motion. However, a close examination shows that it is piecewise conserved: the

only dependence on t is through
numerical value of E is conserved. Consequently, E is a piecewise-conserved constant of motion.

Clearly, E has the dimensions of energy. However, we stress that E is not the mechanical energy of system,

which is a monotonically decreasing function of t, as expected. (Notice that whenever the cosine changes its sign, so
does its amplitude.) Of course, if we add to T (t) the work done by the friction force, we obtain a constant value. The
fact that the total mechanical energy is monotonically decreasing is important: the system loses energy constantly.
We have previously noted that the position and the velocity of the block during each half cycle are inﬂuenced by
the presence of friction only through the initial conditions for that half cycle, but otherwise the motion is simple
oscillatory. Despite this fact, the loss of energy occurs throughout of motion, as is evident from Eq. (18), as should
be expected.

In order to gain some more insight into the meaning of the piecewise-conserved E, let us ﬁnd the time average of

T (t) between two successive turning points. Clearly, the average of the cosine vanishes, and we ﬁnd

Therefore, the physical meaning of E is the following: up to a global additive constant (namely, a constant throughout
the motion) E is equal to the time average of the total mechanical energy of the system T (t) between any two
consecutive turning points. Because of the dissipation, this time average decreases from one phase of the motion to
the next, and therefore E is only piecewise conserved.

We next present our results graphically for two sets of parameters. First, we choose the parameters ℓ = 1 m,
ω = 5 sec−1, M = 1 Kg, g = 9.8 m/sec2, µs = 0.54, and µk = 0.36. (These values for the coeﬃcients of friction
are typical for copper on steel.) In all the ﬁgures below the units of all axes are SI units. Figure 1 displays the
position x(t) and the velocity ˙x(t) vs. the time t. It is clear that the amplitude of the oscillation attenuates, and
eventually the block stops in a state of rest. Figure 2 displays the piecewise-conserved E and the mechanical energy
T as functions of the time t. Indeed, the energy T (t) is a monotonically-decreasing function of t, whereas E(t) is
piecewise-conserved. One can also observe that up to a constant indeed E is the average of the energy T over one
half-cycle of the motion.The dissipation of energy is most clearly portrayed by means of the phase space. Figure 3
shows the orbit of the system in phase space, namely, the momentum p = M ˙x vs. the position x. The loss of energy
is evident from the inspiral of the orbit. Eventually, the orbit arrives at a ﬁnal position in phase space, and stays

4

there forever. For ﬁgures 4,5, and 6 we changed only the coeﬃcients of friction to µs = 0.15 and µk = 0.06. (These
parameters are typical for the contact of two lubricated metal surfaces.) As the coeﬃcients of friction in this case
are smaller than their counterparts in the former case, we can observe many more cycles of motion before the motion
stops. (In fact, the number of half-cycles in this case agrees with Eq. (20) below.) We note that because of the scale
of Fig. 5 it is not apparent that the energy arrives at a non-zero constant value at late times. In this case, also,
the qualitative characteristics of the motion are the same as in the former case (Figs. 1–3), but here the attenuated
oscillatory motion is more apparent.

Of course, the motion will not continue forever: Because of the decrease in the amplitude of the motion, eventually
the static friction force at some turning point would be larger than the elastic force exerted on the block by the spring.
Namely, at t = nP1/2 we ﬁnd x(t = nP1/2) = (−1)n(ℓ − 2nµkg/ω2), for some integer n, and the motion will stop for
µsg ≥ ω2(ℓ − 2nµkg/ω2), or after an integral number of phases which is equal to the least integer n which satisﬁes

We note that for the special case where ω2ℓ2/(µkg) is integral the block may stop at x = 0. This happens, however,
only for special values of the parameters of the systems, and in general the system will rest at x 6= 0.

Then, the block would remain at rest, and E would be a constant of motion from then on. Namely, because of the
dissipative nature of the problem, eventually the piecewise-conserved constant of motion becomes a true constant of
motion, but this happens only when the dynamics of the system becomes trivial. (In our case, when the system is in a
constant state of rest.) This feature of the dissipative system is in contrast with other piecewise-conserved constants
of motion, which arise from non-dissipative systems, such as the truncated Kepler problem or the three-dimensional
isotropic harmonic oscillator, where the piecewise-conserved constant vector remains piecewise conserved for all times.

Abstract

We comment about the general argument given to obtain the rocket equation as it is exposed

in standard textbooks. In our opinion, it can induce students to a wrong answer when solving

variable mass problems.

It is frequently found in standard textbooks [1, 2, 3, 4] a not enough careful demonstration

of the rocket equation. The argument usually presented is misleading (although the ﬁnal

result is fortunately correct) and the consequences of the application of this argument to

other situations, like the problem of a tank ﬁring a projectile, can induce a wrong answer.

One exception to this general presentation is found in [5], which carefully call attention to

the approximate character of the demonstration.

The correct argument to deduce the rocket equation (established by Ivan Vsevolodovich

Meshchersky in 1897) should be: consider a rocket with mass m and velocity v relative to

an inertial frame at instant of time t (usually is the Earth). At time t + ∆t, a quantity of
matter of mass δµ (burnt fuel) have been ejected with velocity −ve relative to the rocket

(the velocity of the ejected fuel is usually assumed constant), while the remaining mass of
the rocket (m − δµ) has its velocity increased by v + δv. But, at instant of time t + ∆t (and
in contradistinction to the general reasoning) the mass δµ has then a velocity v + δv − ve

relatively to the ground. That is, the momentum before and after ﬁring is

p(t) = mv
p(t + ∆t) = (m − δµ)(v + ∆v) + δµ(v + ∆v − ve).

The change of the linear momentum in the interval of time ∆t is due to the action of an
external force Fext - supposed to be only the gravitational force. When obtaining ∆p all

the terms are cancelled out - and there is no need to justify the neglect of the higher order

term δµ∆v. The fundamental equation of dynamics gives

∆p = p(t + ∆t) − p(t) =

Fextdt = −mg∆t.

In the limit ∆t −→ 0 and projecting the vectorial equation in a vertical axis oriented along

v, we obtain

As the total mass (rocket + combustible) is constant, M = m + µ, then dM = 0 = dm + dµ

and the known form of the equation is retrieved

The pedagogical error introduced in the general argument displayed in standard textbooks

will induce a serious error when students are reasoning about variable mass systems, like the

tank ﬁring a projectile. To illustrate this point better, let’s consider a canon installed on a

tank moving without friction over an horizontal track. The canon and tank with total mass

M are both moving initially with velocity u when an projectile with mass m (not included in

M) is ﬁred with velocity v relative to the tank. Consider the axis of the canon and the track

axis are both on the same vertical plan and the canon do an angle α with the horizontal

plan, with α being an acute angle relatively to the direction of displacement of the tank.

Considering that the net force along the horizontal axis is zero, there is conservation of

momentum along this direction.

There is a general believe that there is an ambiguity in the statement of the problem,

because some people argue that v should be relative to the velocity of the tank before

ejection and other people argue that v should be the velocity v relative to the tank after

ejection. Of course, there is no ambiguity at all: the velocity v of the projectile relative to

the tank before ejection is null !. When stating the conservation of momentum, there is only

one possible equation:

p(t) = (M + m)u

p(t + ∆t) = M(u + δu) + m(v cos α + u + δu).

The recoil speed should be

δv = −

mv cos α
M + m

.

and not, δu = − mv cos α

M . Consequently, the range of the projectile in the Earth frame should

xA =

2v sin α

(cid:18)

Mv cos α
M + m (cid:19)

.

and no other solution is correct. The problem is clear. Of course, if m ≪ M the error

is negligible, but otherwise it is not. This kind of generally accepted reasoning should be

corrected because it could lead students (and possibly military engineers...) to the wrong

be

answer.

We present some formulae for the moments of inertia of ho-
mogeneous solids of revolution in terms of the functions that
generate the solids. The development of these expressions ex-
ploits the cylindrical symmetry of these objects, and avoids
the explicit usage of multiple integration, providing an easy
and pedagogical approach. The explicit use of the functions
that generate the solid gives the possibility of writing the mo-
ment of inertia as a functional, which in turn allows to utilize
the calculus of variations to obtain a new insight about some
properties of this fundamental quantity. In particular, min-
imization of moments of inertia under certain restrictions is
possible by using variational methods.

Keywords: Moment of

The moment of inertia (MI) is a very important concept in
Physics and Engineering [1].
In this paper, we present simple
formulae to obtain the MI’s of homogeneous solids of revolution.
The expressions presented here are written in terms of the func-
tions that generate the solid and only require simple integration.
Finally, we show that minimization of the moment of inertia un-
der certain restrictions is possible by employing the calculus of
variations.

Figure 1a shows a function that generates a solid of revo-
lution around the X
axis (we shall call it the “generating
function” henceforth). The narrow rectangle of height f (x)
and width dx generates a thin disk of height dx and radius
f (x). We shall calculate the moment of inertia of the solid
of revolution generated by f (x) with respect to the axis of
symmetry (X

axis).

We know from the literature [1], that the MI of a thin disk

axis is given by (1/2) M R2 where M
with respect to the X
is the mass of the disk and R gives its radius. Thus, the

the thin shaded disk around the axis Y ′ shown in Fig. 1a. It
is well known that for an axis passing through the diameter

This expression provides the perpendicular MI of the solid 1.
The perpendicular MI’s are not usually calculated in common
textbooks. Notwithstanding, they are important in many
physical problems. For instance, some solids of revolution
acting as a physical pendulum require this perpendicular MI.
Eqs. (3, 6) show that IX and IY can be calculated with a
simple integral based on the generating function of the solid.
This simpliﬁcation comes from the cylindrical symmetry that
solids of revolution exhibit. Finally, the cylindrical symmetry
also tells us that IY = IZ .

On the other hand, if we are interested in solids of revo-
lution generated by two functions f1 (x) and f2 (x) as Fig.
1b displays, we only have to substract the contribution of a
solid generated by f1 (x) from the ﬁgure generated by f2 (x)

By making R = 0 (and/or h = 0) we ﬁnd the RG’s for the
truncated cone. With R = 0 and a1 = 0, we get the RG’s of a
cone for which the axes Y and Z pass through its base. Making
R = 0 and a2 = 0, we ﬁnd the RG’s of a cone but with the axes
Y and Z passing through its vertex. Finally, by setting up R = 0,
and a1 = a2; we obtain the RG’s for a cylinder. In many cases
of interest, we need to calculate the MI’s for axes XC , YC and
ZC passing through the center of mass (CM), these MI’s can be
calculated by ﬁnding the position of the CM with respect to the
original coordinate axes, and using the parallel axis theorem. The
position of the CM can be easily found to be (xCM , 0, 0) with

It gives the MI of the solid with respect to the axis of symmetry

estimate the perpendicular MI (with respect to an axis passing
through the CM) of a homogeneous cylindrical shell with inner
radius a1, outer radius a2, and height h. It can be calculated by
replacing x0 =

Equations (23, 24) are especially useful in the case in which the
generating functions f1 (x), f2 (x) do not admit inverses, because
in such case we cannot ﬁnd the corresponding inverse functions

This example shows another advantage of working with a solid
generated around the Y
axis. If you try to do the same problem
by employing Eqs. (7, 8) you need the inverse of the gaussian
distribution and the integration is more complex. Indeed, in many
cases integration involving the inverse of certain function could be
much harder than integrations involving the function itself, even if
the inverse exists. This is another justiﬁcation to develop formulae
for solids generated around the Y

axis.

3 Applications utilizing the calculus

of variations

In all the equations shown in this paper, the MI’s can be seen as
functionals of some generating functions [2]. For simplicity, we
axis with only
take a solid of revolution generated around the X
one generating function. From Eqs. (3, 6) we see that the MI’s
are functionals of f (x), so that

Then, we can use the methods of the calculus of variations (CV)
3, in order to optimize the MI. To ﬁgure out possible applications,
imagine that we should build up a ﬁgure such that under certain
restrictions (that depend on the details of the design) we require
a minimum of energy to set the solid at certain angular velocity
starting from rest. Thus, the optimal design requires the moment
of inertia around the axis of rotation to be a minimum.

As an speciﬁc example, suppose that we have a certain amount
of material and we wish to make up a solid of revolution of a ﬁxed
length with it, such that its MI around a certain axis becomes
a minimum. To do it, let us consider a ﬁxed interval [x0, xf ] of
length L, to generate a solid of revolution of mass M and constant
density ρ (see Fig. 1a). Let us ﬁnd the function f (x), such that
IX or IY become a minimum. Since the mass is kept constant,
we use it as the fundamental constraint

When the bell tolls, it rotates around an axis perpendicular
to the axis of symmetry that passes the top of the bell. Thus,
this is a real situation in which the perpendicular MI is required.

Eqs. (44) show that IY,sph < IY,cyl while IX,cyl < IX,sph. In
both cases if M >> Mmin the MI’s of the spheroid and the cylin-

form of a cylinder when the amount of mass to be distributed in
the interval of length L is increased.

On the other hand, in many applications what really matters
are the MI’s around axes passing through the CM. In the case
of homogeneous solids of revolution the axis that generates the
solid passes through the CM, but this is not necessarily the case
for an axis perpendicular to the former. If we are interested in
minimizing IYC , i.e. the MI with respect to an axis parallel to
Y and passing through the CM, we should write the expression
for IYC by using the parallel axis theorem and by combining Eqs.

Finally, it worths remarking that the techniques of the CV
shown here can be extrapolated to more complex situations, as
long as we are able to see the MI’s as functionals of certain gen-
erating functions. The situations shown here are simple for ped-
agogical reasons, but they open a window for other applications
with other constraints4, for which the minimization cannot be
done by intuition. For instance, if our constraint consists of keep-
ing the surface constant, the solutions are not easy to guess, and
should be developed by variational methods.

4 Conclusions

We found some formulae that provides a direct and simple way
to calculate moments of inertia for homogeneous solids of revolu-
tion. The approach is easy and pedagogical to be used in basic
courses of Physics and Engineering, because multiple integration
is avoided in the demonstration by making proﬁt of the cylindrical
symmetry that solids of revolution possess. It worths emphasizing
that perpendicular moments of inertia are not usually reported in
the literature although they are also important in many physical
applications; however, Eqs. (8, 24) show that they can also be
evaluated by simple integration. In addition, Eqs. (7, 8, 23, 24)
show that we do not have to worry about the partitions usually
required when multiple integration is done, we only have to know
the generating functions of the solid.

On the other hand, it deserves to point out that the formulae
shown here can be seen as functionals of the generating functions
of the solids. This fact permits the use of calculus of variations
to explore the properties of the moments of inertia. In particu-
lar, minimization of moments of inertia under certain restrictions

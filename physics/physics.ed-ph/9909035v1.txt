1. THE “MINIMUM” PRINCIPLES

Forward: The history of “minimum” principles in physics is long and inter-
esting. The study of such principles is based on the idea that the nature acts
always in such a way that the important physical quantities are minimized
whenever a real physical process takes place. The mathematical background
for these principles is the variational calculus.

1. Introduction

The empirical evidence has shown that the motion of a particle in an inertial
system is correctly described by Newton’s second law ~F = d~p/dt, whenever
possible to neglect the relativistic eﬀects. When the particle happens not to
be forced to a complicated motion, the Cartesian coordinates are suﬃcient
to describe the movement. If none of these conditions are fulﬁlled, rather
complicated equations of motion are to be expected.
In addition, when the particle moves on a given surface, certain forces called
constraint forces must exist to maintain the particle in contact with the
surface. Such forces are not so obvious from the phenomenological point
of view; they require a separate postulate in Newtonian mechanics, the one
of action and reaction. Moreover, other formalisms that may look more
general have been developed. These formalisms are equivalent to Newton’s
laws when applied to simple practical problems, but they provide a general
approach for more complicated problems. The Hamilton principle is one
of these methods and its corresponding equations of motion are called the
Euler-Lagrange equations.
If the Euler-Lagrange equations are to be a consistent and correct descrip-
tion of the dynamics of particles, they should be equivalent to Newton’s
equations. However, Hamilton’s principle can also be applied to phenom-
ena generally not related to Newton’s equations. Thus, although HP does
not give a new theory, it uniﬁes many diﬀerent theories which appear as
consequences of a simple fundamental postulate.

The ﬁrst “minimum” principle was developed in the ﬁeld of optics by Heron
of Alexandria about 2,000 years ago. He determined that the law of the
reﬂection of light on a plane mirror was such that the path taken by a light
ray to go from a given initial point to a given ﬁnal point is always the shortest
one. However, Heron’s minimum path principle does not give the right law
of reﬂection. In 1657, Fermat gave another formulation of the principle by
stating that the light ray travels on paths that require the shortest time.
Fermat’s principle of minimal time led to the right laws of reﬂection and
refraction. The investigations of the minimum principles went on, and in
the last half of the XVII century, Newton, Leibniz and Bernoulli brothers
initiated the development of the variational calculus. In the following years,
Lagrange (1760) was able to give a solid mathematical base to this principle.

4

In 1828, Gauss developed a method of studying Mechanics by means of his
principle of minimum constraint. Finally, in a sequence of works published
during 1834-1835, Hamilton presented the dynamical principle of minimum
action.This principle has always been the base of all Mechanics and also of
a big part of Physics.
Action is a quantity of dimensions of length multiplied by the momentum
or energy multiplied by time.

2. The action principle

The most general formulation of the law of motion of mechanical systems
is the action or Hamilton principle. According to this principle every me-
chanical system is characterized by a function deﬁned as:

L

q1, q2, ..., qs, ·q1, ·q2, ·qs, t

,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

or shortly L

q, ·q, t

, and the motion of the system satisﬁes the following

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

condition: assume that at the moments t1 and t2 the system is in the posi-
tions given by the set of coordinates q(1) y q(2); the system moves between
these positions in such a way that the integral

S =

L

q, ·q, t

dt

t2

t1

(1)

Z

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
takes the minimum possible value. The function L is called the Lagrangian
of the system, and the integral (1) is known as the action of the system.
The Lagrange function contains only q and ·q, and no other higher-order
derivatives. This is because the mechanical state is completely deﬁned by
its coordinates and velocities.
Let us establish now the difererential equations that determine the minimum
of the integral (1). For simplicity we begin by assuming that the system has
only one degree of freedom, therefore we are looking for only one function
q (t). Let q = q (t) be the function for which S is a minimum. This means
that S grows when one q (t) is replaced by an arbitrary function

q (t) + δq (t) ,

(2)

where δq (t) is a small function through the interval from t1 to t2 [it is called
the variation of the function q (t)]. Since at t1 and t2 all the functions (2)
should take the same values q(1) and q(2), one gets:

5

What makes S change when q is replaced by q + δq is given by:

δq (t1) = δq (t2) = 0.

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

An expansion in series of this diﬀerence in powers of δq and δ ·q begins by
terms of ﬁrst order. The necessary condition of minimum (or, in general,
extremum) for S is that the sum of all terms turns to zero; Thus, the action
principle can be written down as follows:

t2

δS = δ

or by doing the variation:

Taking into account that δ ·q= d/dt (δq), we make an integration by parts
to get:

∂ ·q !

δqdt = 0 .

(5)

Considering the conditions (3), the ﬁrst term of this expresion disappears.
Only the integral remains that should be zero for all values of δq. This is
possible only if the integrand is zero, which leads to the equation:

∂L
∂q −

d
dt

∂L

∂ ·q

= 0 .

For more degrees of freedom, the s diﬀerent functions qi(t) should vary
independently. Thus, it is obvious that one gets s equations of the form:

d
dt  

∂L
∂ ·qi ! −

∂L
∂qi

= 0

(i = 1, 2, ..., s)

(6)

These are the equations we were looking for; in Mechanics they are called
Euler-Lagrange equations. If the Lagrangian of a given mechanical system

6

is known, then the equations (6) form the relationship between the accel-
erations, the velocities and the coordinates; in other words, they are the
equations of motion of the system. From the mathematical point of view,
the equations (6) form a system of s diﬀerential equations of second order
for s unknown functions qi(t). The general solution of the system contains
2s arbitrary constants. To determine them means to completely deﬁne the
movement of the mechanical system. In order to achieve this, it is neces-
sary to know the initial conditions that characterize the state of the system
at a given moment (for example, the initial values of the coordinates and
velocities.

3. D’Alembert principle

The virtual displacement of a system is the change in its conﬁgurational
space under an arbitrary inﬁnitesimal variation of the coordinates δri,which
is compatible with the forces and constraints imposed on the system at the
given instant t. It is called virtual in order to distinguish it from the real
one, which takes place in a time interval dt, during which the forces and the
constraints can vary.
The constraints introduce two types of diﬃculties in solving mechanics prob-
lems:

(1) Not all the coordinates are independent.
(2) In general, the constraint forces are not known a priori; they are some
unknowns of the problem and they should be obtained from the solution
looked for.
In the case of holonomic constraints the diﬃculty (1) is avoided by introduc-
ing a set of independent coordinates (q1,q2,...,qm, where m is the number of
degrees of freedom involved). This means that if there are m constraint equa-
tions and 3N coordenates (x1, ..., x3N ), we can eliminate these n equations
by introducing the independent variables (q1, q2, .., , qn). A transformation
of the following form is used

x1 = f1(q1, ..., qm, t)

x3N = f3N (q1, ..., qn, t) ,

...

7

−

m.

where n = 3N
To avoid the diﬃculty (2) Mechanics needs to be formulated in such a way
that the forces of constraint do not occur in the solution of the problem.
This is the essence of the “principle of virtual work”.

Virtual work: We assume that a system of N particles is described by
3N coordenates (x1, x2, ..., x3N ) and let F1,F2,...,F3N be the components of
the forces acting on each particle.
If the particles of the system display
inﬁnitesimal and instantaneous displacements δx1, δx2, ..., δx3N under the
action of the 3N forces, then the performed work is:

Xj=1
Such displacements are known as virtual displacements and δW is called
virtual work; (7) can be also written as:

3N

δW =

Fjδxj .

δW =

δr .

Fα ·

N

Xα=1

Forces of constraint: besides the applied forces F(e)
acted on by forces of constraint Fα.
The principle of virtual work: Let Fα be the force acting on the particle
α of the system. If we separate Fα in a contribution from the outside F(e)
α
and the constraint Rα

α , the particles can be

and if the system is in equilibrium, then

Fα = F(e)

α + Rα .

Fα = F(e)

α + Rα = 0 .

Thus, the virtual work due to all possible forces Fα is:

N

W =

N

Fα ·

δrα =

F(e)

α + Rα

δrα = 0 .

·

Xα=1 (cid:16)
If the system is such that the constraint forces do not make virtual work,
then from (11) we obtain:

Xα=1

(cid:17)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

Taking into account the previous deﬁnition, we are now ready to introduce
the D’Alembert principle. According to Newton, the equation of motion is:

N

Xα=1

F(e)
α ·

δrα = 0 .

8

and can be written in the form

Fα = ·pα

Fα−

·pα= 0 ,

which tells that the particles of the system would be in equilibrium under the
·pi. Instead
action of a force equal to the real one plus an inverted force
of (12) we can write

−

N

Xα=1 (cid:18)

Fα−

·pα

(cid:19) ·

δrα = 0

(13)

(14)

and by doing the same decomposition in applied and constraint forces (fα),
we obtain:

N

Xα=1 (cid:18)

F(e)

α −

·pα

(cid:19) ·

δrα +

δrα = 0 .

fα ·

N

Xα=1

Again, let us limit ourselves to systems for which the virtual work due to
the forces of constraint is zero leading to

N

Xα=1 (cid:18)

F(e)

α −

·pα

(cid:19) ·

δrα = 0 ,

which is the D’Alembert’s principle. However, this equation does not have
a useful form yet for getting the equations of motion of the system. There-
fore, we should change the principle to an expression entailing the virtual
displacements of the generalized coordinates, which being independent from
each other, imply zero coeﬃcients for δqα. Thus, the velocity in terms of
the generalized coordinates reads:

vα =

drα
dt

=

∂rα
∂qk

·qk +

∂rα
∂t

Xk

where

rα = rα (q1, q2, ..., qn, t) .

Similarly, the arbitrary virtual displacement δrα can be related to the virtual
displacements δqj through

δrα =

∂rα
∂qj

δqj .

Xj

Then, the virtual work Fα expressed in terms of the generalized coordinates
will be:

δrα =

(15)

where the Qj are the so-called components of the generalized force, deﬁned
in the form

Now if we see eq. (14) as:

The variables qj can be an arbitrary system of coordinates describing the
motion of the system. However, if the constraints are holonomic, it is possi-
ble to ﬁnd systems of independent coordinates qj containing implicitly the
constraint conditions already in the equations of transformation xi = fi if
one nulliﬁes the coeﬃcients by separate:

(18)

There are m equations. The equations (18) are sometimes called the La-
grange equations, although this terminology is usually applied to the form
they take when the forces are conservative (derived from a scalar potential
V)

Then Qj can be written as:

Fα =

−∇iV.

and deﬁning the Lagrangian L in the form L = T

(20)

These are the Lagrange equations of motion.

4. - Phase space

In the geometrical interpretation of mechanical phenomena the concept of
phase space is very much in use. It is a space of 2s dimensions whose axes
of coordinates are the s generalized coordinates and the s momenta of the
given system. Each point of this space corresponds to a deﬁnite mechanical
state of the system. When the system is in motion, the representative point
in phase space performs a curve called phase trajectory.

5. - Space of conﬁgurations

The state of a system composed of n particles under the action of m con-
straints connecting some of the 3n cartesian coordinates is completely de-
termined by s = 3n
m generalized coordinates. Thus, it is possible to
descibe the state of such a system by a point in the s dimensional space
usually called the conﬁguration space, for which each of its dimensions cor-
responds to one qj. The time evolution of the system will be represented by a
curve in the conﬁguration space made of points describing the instantaneous
conﬁguration of the system.

−

6. - Constraints

One should take into account the constraints that act on the motion of the
system. The constraints can be classiﬁed in various ways. In the general
case in which the constraint equations can be written in the form:

cαi

·qi= 0 ,

Xi

11

where the cαi are functions of only the coordinates (the index α counts
the constraint equations). If the ﬁrst members of these equations are not
total derivatives with respect to the time they cannot be integrated. In other
words, they cannot be reduced to relationships between only the coordinates,
that might be used to express the position by less coordinates, corresponding
to the real number of degrees of freedom. Such constraints are called non
holonomic (in contrast to the previous ones which are holonomic and which
connect only the coordinates of the system).
7. Hamilton’s equations of motion

The formulation of the laws of Mechanics by means of the Lagrangian as-
sumes that the mechanical state of the system is determined by its gener-
alized coordinates and velocities. However, this is not the unique possible
method; the equivalent description in terms of its generalized coordinates
and momenta has a number of advantages.
Turning from one set of independent variables to another one can be achieved
by what in mathematics is called Legendre transformation. In this case the
transformation takes the following form where the total diﬀerential of the
Lagrangian as a function of coordinates and velocities is:

dL =

∂L
∂qi

that can be written as:

(21)

where we already know that the derivatives ∂L/∂ ·qi, are by deﬁnition the
generalized momenta and moreover ∂L / ∂qi = ·pi by Lagrange equations.
The second term in eq. (21)can be written as follows

pid ·qi= d

These are the equations of motion in the variables q y p and they are called
Hamilton’s equations.

8. Conservation laws

8.1 Energy
Consider ﬁrst the conservation theorem resulting from the homogeneity of
time. Because of this homogeneity, the Lagrangian of a closed system does
not depend explicitly on time. Then, the total time diferential of the La-
grangian (not depending explicitly on time) can be written:

dL

remains constant during the movement of the closed system, that is it is
an integral of motion. This constant quantity is called the energy E of the
system.
8.2 Momentum
The homogeneity of space implies another conservation theorem. Because
of this homogeneity, the mechanical properties of a cosed system do not
vary under a parallel displacement of the system as a whole through space.
We consider an inﬁnitesimal displacement ǫ (i.e., the position vectors rα
turned into ra + ǫ) and look for the condition for which the Lagrangian does
not change. The variation of the function L resulting from the inﬁnitesi-
mal change of the coordinates (maintaining constant the velocities of the
particles) is given by:

δL =

δra = ǫ

∂L
∂ra ·

a
X

∂L

,

·

extending the sum over all the particles of the system. Since ǫ is arbitrary,
the condition δL = 0 is equivalent to

and taking into account the already mentioned equations of Lagrange

Thus, we reach the conclusion that for a closed mechanical system the vec-
torial quantity called impetus/momentum

remains constant during the motion.
8.3 Angular momentum
Let us study now the conservation theorem coming out from the isotropy of
space. For this we consider an inﬁnitesimal rotation of the system and look
for the condition under which the Lagrangian does not change.
We shall call an inﬁnitesimal rotation vector δφ a vector of modulus equal
to the angle of rotation δφ and whoose direction coincide with that of the
rotation axis. We shall look ﬁrst to the increment of the position vector

∂L
∂va

P

of a particle in the system, by taking the origin of coordinates on the axis
of rotation. The lineal displacement of the position vector as a function of
angle is

δr

(see the ﬁgure). The direction of the vector δr is perpendicular to the plane
deﬁned by r and δφ, and therefore,

δr =δφ

r .

(27)

d r

The rotation of the system changes not only the directions of the position
vectors but also the velocities of the particles that are modiﬁed by the same
rule for all the vectors. The velocity increment with respect to a ﬁxed frame
system will be:

δv = δφ

v .

We apply now to these expressions the condition that the Lagrangian does
not vary under rotation:

δL =

2. MOTION IN CENTRAL FORCES

Forward: Because of astronomical reasons, the motion under the action of
central forces has been the physical problem on which pioneer researchers
focused more, either from the observational standpoint or by trying to disen-
tangle the governing laws of motion. This movement is a basic example for
many mathematical formalisms. In its relativistic version, Kepler’s problem
is yet an area of much interest.

2.1 Two-body problem: Reduction to the one-body problem
Consider a system of two material points of masses m1 and m2, in which
there are forces due only to an interaction potential V . We suppose that V
is a function of any position vector between m1 and m2, r2 −
r1, or of their
relative velocities ·r2 −
r1. Such
a system has 6 degrees of freedom and therefore 6 independent generalized
coordinates.
We suppose that these are the vector coordinates of the center-of-mass R,
r1. The
plus the three components of the relative diﬀerence vector r = r2 −
Lagrangian of the system can be written in these coordinates as follows:

·r1, or of the higher-order derivatives of r2 −

L = T ( ˙R, ˙r)

V (r, ˙r, ¨r, .....).

The kinetic energy T is the sum of the kinetic energy of the center-of-mass
plus the kinetic energy of the motion around it, T´:

From this equation we see that the coordinates ˙R are cyclic implying that
the center-of-mass is either ﬁxed or in uniform motion.
Now, none of the equations of motion for r will contain a term where R or
˙R will occur. This term is exactly what we will have if a center of force
would have been located in the center of mass with an additional particle
at a distance r away of mass µ (the reduced mass).
Thus, the motion of two particles around their center of mass, which is due
to a central force can be always reduced to an equivalent problem of a single
body.

2.2 Equations of motion
Now we limit ourselves to conservative central forces for which the potential
is a function of only r, V (r), so that the force is directed along r. Since
in order to solve the problem we only need to tackle a particle of mass
m moving around the ﬁxed center of force, we can put the origin of the
reference frame there. As the potential depends only on r, the problem has
spherical symmetry, that is any arbitrary rotation around a ﬁxed axis has no
eﬀect on the solution. Therefore, an angular coordinate representing that
rotation should be cyclic providing another considerable simpliﬁcation to
the problem. Due to the spherical symmetry, the total angular momentum

L = r

p

×

is conserved. Thus, it can be inferred that r is perpendicular to the ﬁxed
axis of L. Now, if L = 0 the motion should be along a line passing through
the center of force, since for L = 0 r and ˙r are parallel. This happens only
in the rectilinear motion, and therefore central force motions proceed in one
plane.
By taking the z axis as the direction of L, the motion will take place in the
(x, y) plane. The spherical angular coordinate φ will have the constant value
π/2 and we can go on as foollows. The conservation of the angular momen-
tum provides three independent constants of motion. As a matter of fact,
two of them, expressing the constant direction of the angular momentum,
are used to reduce the problem of three degrees of freedom to only two. The
third coordinate corresponds to the conservation of the modulus of L.
In polar coordinates the Lagrangian is

L =

m( ˙r2 + r2 ˙θ2)

V (r) .

As we have seen, θ is a cyclic coordinate whose canonically conjugate mo-
mentum is the angular momentum

then, one of the equations of motion will be

where l is constant modulus of the angular momentum. From equation (5)
one also gets

The factor 1/2 is introduced because (r2 ˙θ)/2 is the areolar velocity (the area
covered by the position vector per unit of time).
The conservation of the angular momentum is equivalent to saying that the
areolar velocity is constant. This is nothing else than a proof of Kepler’s
second law of planetary motion: the position vector of a planet covers equal
areas in equal time intervals. However, we stress that the constancy of the
areolar velocity is a property valid for any central force not only for inverse
square ones.

This equation gives t as a function of r and of the constants of integration
E, l and r0.
It can be inverted, at least in a formal way, to give r as a
function of t and of the constants. Once we have r, there is no problem to
get θ starting from equation (6), that can be written as follows

If θ0 is the initial value of θ, then (17) will be

θ.

2.3 The diﬀerential equation of the orbit
A change of our standpoint regarding the approach of real central force prob-
lems prove to be convenient. Till now, solving the problem meant seeking r
and θ as functions of time and some constants of integration such as E, l,
etc. However, quite often, what we are really looking for is the equation of
the orbit, that is the direct dependence between r and θ, by eliminating the
time parameter t. In the case of central force problems, this elimination is
particularly simple because t is to be found in the equations of motion only
in the form of a variable with respect to which the derivatives are performed.
Indeed, the equation of motion (6) gives us a deﬁnite relationship between
dt and dθ

ldt = mr2dθ.

(19)

The corresponding relationship between its derivatives with respect to t and
θ is

l
mr2
This relationship can be used to convert (10) in a diﬀerential equation for
the orbit. At the same time, one can solve for the equations of motion and
go on to get the orbit equation. For the time being, we follow up the ﬁrst
route.
From equation (20) we can write the second derivative with respect to t

Any of the equations (22) or (23) is the diﬀerential equation of the orbit if

equation we can get f or V .
For an arbitrary particular force law, the orbit equation can be obtained
by integrating the equation (22). Since a great deal of work has been done
when solving (10), we are left with the task of eliminating t in the solution

2.5 Dispersion by a center of force
From a historical point of view, the interest on central forces was related to
the astronomical problem of planetary motions. However, there is no reason
to consider them only under these circumstances. Another important issue
that one can study within Classical Mechanics is the dispersion of particles
by central forces. Of course, if the particles are of atomic size, we should keep
in mind that the classical formalism may not give the right result because
of quantum eﬀects that begin to be important at those scales. Despite this,
there are classical predictions that continue to be correct. Moreover, the
main concepts of the dispersion phenomena are the same in both Classical
Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics; thus, one can learn this scientiﬁc idiom
in the classical picture, usually considered more convenient.
In its one-body formulation, the dispersion problem refers to the action
of the center of force on the trajectories of the coming particles. Let us
consider a uniform beam of particles, (say electrons, protons, or planets and
comets), but all of the same mass and energy impinging on a center of force.

27

We can assume that the force diminishes to zero at large distances. The
incident beam is characterized by its intensity I (also called ﬂux density),
which is the number of particles that pass through per units of time and
normal surface. When one particle comes closer and closer to the center of
force will be attracted or repelled, and its orbit will deviate from the initial
rectilinear path. Once it passed the center of force, the perturbative eﬀects
will diminish such that the orbit tends again to a streight line. In general,
the ﬁnal direction of the motion does not coincide with the incident one.
One says that the particle has been dispersed. By deﬁnition, the diﬀerential
cross section σ(Ω) is

σ(Ω)dΩ =

dN
I

,

(34)

where dN is the number of particles dispersed per unit of time in the element
of solid angle dΩ around the Ω direction. In the case of central forces there
is a high degree of symmetry around the incident beam axis. Therefore, the
element of solid angle can be written

dΩ = 2π sin ΘdΘ,

(35)

where Θ is the angle between two incident dispersed directions, and is called
the dispersion angle.
For a given arbitrary particle the constants of the orbit and therefore the
degree of dispersion are determined by its energy and angular momentum.
It is convenient to express the latter in terms of a function of energy and
the so-called impact parameter s, which by deﬁnition is the distance from
the center of force to the straight suport line of the incident velocity. If u0
is the incident velocity of the particle, we have

l = mu0s = s

2√2mE.

·

(36)

Once E and s are ﬁxed, the angle of dispersion Θ is uniquely determined.
For the time being, we suppose that diﬀerent values of s cannot lead to
the same dispersion angle. Therefore, the number of dispersed particles in
the element of solid angle dΩ between Θ and Θ + dΘ should be equal to
the number of incident particles whose impact parameter ranges within the
corresponding s and s + ds:

2πIs

ds
|

|

= 2πσ(Θ)I sin Θ

.

dΘ
|

|

(37)

In the equation (37) we have introduced absolute values because while the
number of particles is always positive, s and Θ can vary in opposite direc-
tions. If we consider s as a function of the energy and the corresponding

28

dispersion angle,

s = s(Θ, E),

the dependence of the cross section of Θ will be given by

σ(Θ) =

s
sin Θ (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
From the orbit equation (25), one can obtain directly a formal expression
(cid:12)
for the dispersion angle. In addition, for the sake of simplicity, we tackle
the case of a pure repulsive dispersion. Since the orbit should be symmetric
with respect to the direction of the periapsis, the dispersion angle is

where Ψ is the angle between the direction of the incident asymptote and
the direction of the periapsis. In turn, Ψ can be obtained from the equation
(25) by making r0 =

when r = rm, the closest distance of the particle to the center of force.
Then, one can easily obtain

when θ0 = π (incident direction). Thus, θ = π

The equations (41) and (42) are used rarely, as they do not enter in a direct
way in the numerical calculation of the dispersion angle. However, when an
analytic expression for the orbits is available, one can often get, merely by
simple inspection, a relationship between Θ and s.

EXAMPLE:
This example is very important from the historical point of view. It refers
to the repulsive dispersion of charged particles in a Coulomb ﬁeld. The ﬁeld

The equation (47) gives the famous Rutherford scattering cross section de-
rived by him for the dispersion of α particles on atomic nuclei. In the non-

calculations.

Its deﬁnition is

However, if we calculate the total cross section for the Coulombian dispersion
by substituting the equation (47) in the deﬁnition above we get an inﬁnite
result. The physical reason is easy to see. According to the deﬁnition, the
total cross section is the number of particles per unit of incident intensity
that are dispersed in all directions. The Coulombian ﬁeld is an example of
long-range force; its eﬀects are still present in the inﬁnite distance limit. The
small deviation limit is valid only for particles of large impact parameter.
Therefore, for an incident beam of inﬁnite lateral extension all the particles
will be dispersed and should be included in the total cross section. It is clear
that the inﬁnite value of σT is not a special property of the Coulombian ﬁeld
and occurs for any type of long-range ﬁeld.

3.1 Deﬁnition
A rigid body (RB) is deﬁned as a system of particles whose relative distances
are forced to stay constant during the motion.

3.2 Degrees of freedom
In order to describe the general motion of a RB in the three-dimensional
space one needs six variables, for example the three coordinates of the center
of mass measured with respect to an inertial frame and three angles for
labeling the orientation of the body in space (or of a ﬁxed system within
the body with the origin in the center of mass).
In other words, in the
three-dimensional space the RB can be described by at most six degrees of
freedom.
The number of degrees of freedom may be less when the rigid body is sub-
jected to various conditions as follows:

•

•

If the RB rotates around a single axis there is only one degree of
freedom (one angle).

If the RB moves in a plane, its motion can be described by ﬁve degrees
of freedom (two coordinates and three angles).

3.3 Tensor of inertia.
We consider a body made of N particles of masses mα, α = 1, 2, 3..., N .
If the body rotates at angular velocity ω around a ﬁxed point in the body
and this point, in turn, moves at velocity v with respect to a ﬁxed inertial
system, then the velocity of the αth particle w.r.t. the inertial system is
given by

The kinetic energy of the αth particle is

To seek a diagonal form of
is equivalent to ﬁnding a new system of
three axes for which the kinetic energy and the angular momentum take the
form given by (27) and (28). In this case the axes are called principal axes
of inertia. That means that given an inertial reference system within the
body, we can pass from it to the principal axes by a particular orthogonal
transformation, which is called transformation to the principal axes.
Making equal the components of (22) and (28), we have

This is a system of equations that can be rewritten as

L1 = Iω1 = I11ω1 + I12ω2 + I13ω3
L2 = Iω2 = I21ω1 + I22ω2 + I23ω3
L3 = Iω3 = I31ω1 + I32ω2 + I33ω3 .

This determinant leads to a polynomial of third order in I, known as the
characteristic polynomial. The equation (33) is called the secular equation or
characteristic equation. In practice, the principal moments of inertia, being
the eigenvalues of I, are obtained as solutions of the secular equation.

Determine the principal axes of inertia for the cube of the previous example.

3.6 The theorem of parallel axes
We suppose that the system x1, x2, x3 has the origin in the center of mass
of the RB. A second system X1, X2, X3, has the origin in another position
w.r.t. the ﬁrst system. The only imposed condition on them is to be parallel.
We deﬁne the vectors r = (x1, x2, x3), R = (X1, X2, X3) y a = (a1, a2, a3)
in such a way that R = r + a, or in component form

Let Jij be the components of the tensor of inertia w.r.t. the system X1X2X3,

we take into account that we have already set the origin in the center of
mass, i.e.,

(¯x1, ¯x2, ¯x3) = (0, 0, 0) .

Now, if we also compare the ﬁrst term in (36) with the equation (13), we
have

3.7 The dynamics of the rigid body
The rate of change in time of the angular momentum L is given by:

dL
dt (cid:19)inertial

(cid:18)

= N(e).

For the description w.r.t. the system ﬁxed to the body we have to use the
operator identity

d
dt!body
Applying this operator to the equation (50)

d
dt!inertial

=

 

 

+ ω

.

×

dL
dt !inertial

 

=

dL
dt !body

 

+ ω

L.

×

Then, instead of (50) we shall have

Now we project the equation (53) onto the principal axes of inertia, that we
call (x1, x2, x3); then Trot and L take by far simpler forms, e.g.,

The ith component of (53) is

L = N.

+ ǫijkωjLk = Ni .

Now projecting onto the principal axes of inertia and using the equation
(54), one can put (55) in the form:

since the principal elements of inertia are independent of time. Thus, we
obtain the following system of equations known as Euler’s equations

Ii

I2) = N3 .

EXAMPLE:
For the rolling and sliding of a billiard ball, prove that after a horizontal
kick the ball slips a distance

where u0 is the initial velocity. Then, it starts rolling without gliding at the
time

3.9 Euler angles
As we already know, a rotation can be described by a rotation matrix λ by
means of the equation

x = λx´.

(79)

x represents the set of axes of the system rotated w.r.t. the system whose
axes are represented by x´. The rotation λ can be accomplished through
a set of “partial” rotations λ = λ1λ2...λn. There are many possibilities to
choose these λ´s. One of them is the set of angles φ, θ and ϕ called Euler
angles. The partial rotations are in this case the following:

•

A rotation around the X´3 axis of angle ϕ (in the positive trigonometric
sense). The corresponding matrix is:

•

A rotation of angle θ around the X´´1 axis (positive sense).The associ-
ated matrix is:

˙θ3 = 0

3.10 Symmetrical top with a ﬁxed point
As a more complicated example of the methods used to describe the dynam-
ics of the rigid body, we shall consider the motion of a symmetric body in a
unifom gravitational ﬁeld when a point of the axis of symmetry is ﬁxed in
the space.
The axis of symmetry is of course one of the principal axes, and we shall
take it as the z axis of the body-ﬁxed reference system. Since there is a
ﬁxed point, the conﬁguration of the top will be determined by the three
Euler angles: θ measuring the deviation of z from the vertical, φ, giving the
azimuth of the top w.r.t. the vertical, and ϕ, which is the rotation angle of
the top w.r.t. its proper z. The distance from the center of gravity to the
ﬁxed point will be denoted by l. To get a solution to the motion of the top
we shall use the method of Lagrange instead of the Euler equations.
The kinetic energy is:

According to an elementary theorem, in a constant gravitational ﬁeld the
potential energy of a body is the same with that of a material point of equal
mass concentrated in its center of mass. A formal proof is as follows. The
potential energy of the body is the sum of the potential energies of all its
particles:

miri ·
where g is the constant acceleration of gravity. According to the deﬁnition
of the center of mass, this is equivalent to

V =

thus proving the theorem. The potential energy is a function of the Euler
angles:

Forward: A familiar type of motion in mechanical and many other systems
are the small oscillations (vibrations). They can be met as atomic and
molecular vibrations, electric circuits, acoustics, and so on. In general, any
motion in the neighborhood of stable equilibria is vibrational.

4.1 THE SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

A system is at stable equilibrium when its potential energy U (q) is at min-
imum; when the system is slightly displaced from the equilibrium position,
a force
dU/dq occurs which acts to restore the equilibrium. Let q0 be the
value of the generalized coordinate corresponding to the equilibrium posi-
q0 for small deviations

This means that there are no external forces acting on the system and the
zero has been chosen at the equilibrium position; moreover, higher-order
terms have been neglected. The coeﬃcient k represents the value of the
second derivative of U (q) for q=q0. For simplicity reasons we denote

or, we can also write the solution in the form:

x = c1 cos wt + c2 sin wt ,

x = a cos(wt + α) .

Since cos(wt + α) = cos wt cos α

Thus, any system in the neighborhood of the stable equilibrium position
performs harmonic oscillatory motion. The a coeﬃcient in (7) is the am-
plitude of the oscillations, whereas the argument of the cosine function is
the phase of the harmonic oscillation; α is the initial value of the phase,
which depends on the chosen origin of time. The quantity w is the angular
frequency of the oscillations, which does not depend on the initial conditions
of the system, being a proper characteristic of the harmonic oscillations.
Quite often the solution is expressed as the real part of a complex quantity

where A is the complex amplitude, whose modulus gives the ordinary am-
plitude:

The energy of a system in small oscillatory motion is:

x = Re [A exp(iwt)]

A = a exp(iα) .

4.2 FORCED HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

If an external weak force acts on an oscillator system the oscillations of the
system are known as forced oscillations.
Besides its proper potential energy the system gets a supplementary po-
tential energy Ue(x, t) due to the external ﬁeld. Expanding the latter in a
Taylor series of small amplitudes x we get:

Ue(x, t) ∼= Ue(0, t) + x

∂x

(cid:21)x=0

The second term is the external force acting on the system at its equilibrium
position, that we denote by F (t). Then, the Lagrangian reads

L =

The corresponding equation of motion is

m ··x +kx = F (t) ,

or

··x +w2x = F (t)/m ,

(24)

where w is the frequency of the proper oscillations. The general solution of
this equation is the sum of the solution of the homogeneous equation and a
particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation

We shall study the case in which the external force is periodic in time of
frequency γ forma

x = xh + xp .

F (t) = f cos(γt + β) .

The particular solution of (24) is sought in the form x1 = b cos(γt + β) and
by substituting it one ﬁnds that the relationship b = f /m(w2
γ2) should
be fulﬁlled. Adding up both solutions, one gets the general solution

4.3 DAMPED HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

Until now we have studied oscillatory motions in free space (the vacuum),
or when the eﬀects of the medium through which the oscillator moves are
negligeable. However, when a system moves through a medium its motion
is retarded by the reaction of the latter. There is a dissipation of the energy
in heat or other forms of energy. We are interested in a simple description
of the dissipation phenomena.
The reaction of the medium can be imagined in terms of friction forces.
When they are small we can expand them in powers of the velocity. The
zero-order term is zero because there is no friction force acting on a body
at rest. Thus, the lowest order nonzero term is proportional to the velocity,
and moreover we shall neglect all higher-order terms

fr =

α ·x ,

−
where x is the generalized coordinate and α is a positive coeﬃcient; the
minus sign shows the oposite direction to that of the moving system. Adding
this force to the equation of motion we get

Writing k/m = w2
tions of the system and λ is the damping coeﬃcient. Therefore

o and α/m = 2λ; where wo is the frequency of free oscilla-

The solution of this equation is sought of the type x = exp(rt), which we
substitute back in the equation to get the characteristic equation for r. Thus

the form

x = a exp(

λt) cos(wt + α), where w =

(28)

−

(w2

o −

λ2) ,

q

where a and α are real constants. Thus, one can say that a damped oscil-
lation is a harmonic oscillation with an exponentially decreasing amplitude.
The rate of decreasing of the amplitude is determined by the exponent λ.
Moreover, the frequency w is smaller than that of free oscillations.

(ii) λ > wo. Then, both r are real and negative. The general form of the

solution is:

x = c1 exp

asymptotically (t

lations). This type of motion is called aperiodic.

The components ρjl (l = 1, 2, .., n) are determined by solving the eigenvalue

4.5 PARAMETRIC RESONANCE






The important phenomenon of parametric resonance shows up for systems
initially at rest in un unstable equilibrium position, say x = 0; thus, the
slightest deviation from this position produces a displacement growing rapidly
(exponentially) in time. This is diﬀerent from the ordinary resonances,
where the displacement grows only linearly in time.
The parameters of a linear system are the coeﬃcients m and k of the La-
grangian (4); if they are functions of time, the equation of motion is:

d
dt

(m ·x) + kx = 0 .

(37)

If we take a constant mass, the previous equation can be written in the form

d2x
dt2 + w2(t)x = 0 .
The function w(t) is given by the problem at hand. Assuming it a periodic
function of frequency γ (of period T = 2π/γ), i.e.,

(38)

any equation of the type (38) is invariant w.r.t. the transformation t
t+T .
Thus, if x(t) is one of its solutions, x(t + T ) is also a solution. Let x1(t) and

→

w(t + T ) = w(t) ,

67

x2(t) be two independent solutions of 4.6.2). They should change to itselves
in a linear combination when t

t + T . Thus, one gets

→

x1(t + T ) = µ1x(t)
x2(t + T ) = µ2x(t) ,

(39)

or, in general

where F (t) and G(t) are periodical functions in time of period T . The
relationship between these constants can be obtained by manipulating the
following equations

x1(t) = µt/T
x2(t) = µt/T

1 F (t)
2 G(t) ,

..
x1 +w2(t)x1 = 0
..
x2 +w2(t)x2 = 0 .

Multiplying by x2 and x1, respectively, and substracting term by term, we
get

or

..

x1 x2−

..
x2 x1 =

d
dt

.

x1 x2−
(

x2 x1) = 0 ,

.

x1 x2−

.
x2 x1 = const. .

Substituting t by t + T in the previous equation, the right hand side is
multiplied by µ1µ2 (see eqs.
(39)); thus, it is obvious that the following
condition holds

µ1µ2 = 1 ,

(40)

where one should take into account (38) and the fact that the coeﬃcients
are real. If x(t) is one integral of this equation, then x∗(t) is also a solution.
Therefore µ1, µ2 should coincide with µ∗1, µ∗2. This leads to either µ1=µ∗2 or
µ1 and µ2 both real. In the ﬁrst case, based on (40) one gets µ1 = 1/ µ∗1,

68

that is equivalent to
are of the form

2 =

|

µ2|

2 = 1. In the second case, the two solutions

x1(t) = µt/T F (t)
x2(t) = µ−

t/T G(t) .

One of these functions grows exponentially in time, which is the character-
istic feature of the parametric resonance.

Forward: The main idea of canonical transformations is to ﬁnd all those
coordinate systems in the phase space for which the form of the Hamilton
eqs is invariant for whatever Hamiltonian. In applications one chooses the
coordinate system that allows a simple solution of the problem at hand.

We can see that indeed the given transformation is canonical. We know
that a dynamical system is usually characterized by a Hamiltonian H =
H(q, p, t), where q = q(q1, q2, ..., qn), and p = p(p1, p2, ..., pn). Therefore,
the dynamics of the system fulﬁlls a set of 2n ﬁrst-order diﬀerential eqs

Let us denote the coordinate transformations in the phase space by

According to the aforementioned principle for the set of canonical trans-
formations denoted by (3) and (4), analogously to (1) and (2), there is a
function K = K(Q, P, t) such that we can write

The relationship between the Hamiltonian H and the Kamiltonian K 1 can
be obtained arguing as follows2.

Thus, (10) and (11) diﬀer only by constant terms whose variation is zero in
Hamilton’s principle.
It follows that the Hamiltonian H and the Kamiltonian K are related by
the equation 3

The function F is the so-called generating function.
It can be expressed
as a function of any arbitrary set of independent variables. However, some
very convenient results are obtained if F is expressed as a function of the n
old variables and the n new ones, plus the time. The results are especially
convenient if the n old variables are exactly the n qi - or the n pi-, and if
the new variables are all of them the n Qi - or the n Pi.

Using these coordinates, the possible combinations of n old variables and n
new variables -including t- in the generating function are4

3Some authors add to the right hand side of this equation a constant multiplicative
factor A that does not change (9). Here we use A = 1, that is, we decided to work
with the so-called reduced canonical transformations, since this simpler case is suﬃcient
to illustrate the structure of the canonical transformations.

4We shall use the convention of Goldstein to denote each of the diﬀerent combinations

of the new and old variables in the generating function.

F1 = F1(Q, q, t)
F2 = F2(P, q, t)
F3 = F3(Q, p, t)
F4 = F4(P, p, t) .

On the other hand, if we multiply (12) by dt we get:

pidqi −

Hdt = P dQi −

Kdt + dF .

F1 above, and recalling that dQi, dqi, and dt are

Using now some algebraic manipulation it is possible to obtain analogous
expressions to the previous one for the rest of the generating functions. The
results are the following:

F2 : Qi = ∂F2
∂Pi

pi = ∂F2
∂qi

K = H + ∂F2

In practice, one usually applies a useful theorem (see below) that allows,
together with the deﬁnitions we gave in the introduction for canonical trans-
formations, to solve any mechanical problem of interest 5.
Theorem 5.1 We consider a system acted by a given external force. We
also suppose that the dynamical state of the system is determined by a set
of variables q, p = q1, q2, ..., qn, p1, p2, ..., pn and that the Hamiltonian of the
system is H = H(q, p, t). The time evolution of the variables q and p is
given by Hamilton’s eqs.

If we now perform a transformation to the new variables

P = P (q, p, t)

5.2 Necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a trans-
formation to be canonical

We have already mentioned that by a canonical transformation we mean a
transformation, which, independently of the form of the Hamiltonian, keeps
unchanged the form of Hamilton’s equations. However, one should be very
careful with this issue because some transformations fulﬁll this requirement
only for a particular Hamiltonian 6. Some authors call such transformations
canonical transformations w.r.t. H 7.

To illustrate this point we use the following example, given in the paper
of J. Hurley: Let us consider a particular physical system whose Hamilto-
nian is

It is easy to show that the Kamiltonian K given by

then it is possible to ﬁnd a Kamiltonian K for which the usage of the trans-
formation equations (16) maintains unchanged the form of Hamilton’s equa-
tions. Thus, the equations (16) keeps unchanged the form of Hamilton’s
equations only for a particular Hamiltonian.
It can be shown that the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the canonic-
ity of transformations of the form (3) and (4), that is, to keep unchanged the
form of Hamilton’s equations whatever the Hamiltonian, are the following

where α is an arbitrary constant related to scale changes. Finally, we would
like to make a few important comments before closing this section. First, we
should keep in mind that Q and P are not variables deﬁning the conﬁguration
of the system, i.e., they are not in general a set of generalized coordinates
8. To distinguish Q and P from the generalized coordinates q and p, one

calls them canonical variables. In addition, the equations of motion -similar
in form to the Hamiltonian ones- for the generalized coordinates q and p-
that one gets for Q and P are called canonical Hamilton equations. Second,
although we did not check here, if the transformation Q = Q(q, p, t) and
P = P (q, p, t) is canonical, then its inverse q = q(Q, P, t) and p = p(Q, P, t)
is also canonical 9.

5.3 Example of application of TC

As we already mentioned in the introduction, the main idea in performing
a canonical transformation is to ﬁnd a phase space coordinate system for
which the form of the Hamilton eqs is maintaind whatever the Hamiltonian
and to choose the one that makes easy the solution of the problem. We
illustrate this important fact with the following example.
EXAMPLE:
The Hamiltonian of a physical system is given by H = ω2p(q + t)2, where ω
is a constant. Determine q as a function of time.
Solution:
1. Solving the Hamilton equations for the variables q and p. Applying (1)
and (2) to the given Hamiltonian we get

ω2(q + t)2 = ˙q,

2ω2p(q + t) =

˙p .

−

This system is not easy to solve. However, we can get the solution by means
of an appropriate canonical transformation as we show in the following.
2. Using Q = q + t, P = p. According to the theorem given in section (5.1),
since

results on the PB formulation of the eqs of motion of the dynamical systems
12:
Theorem 6.2 Consider a system whose dynamical state is deﬁned by the
canonical variables q, p and whose dynamical behaviour is deﬁned by the
Hamiltonian H = H(q, p, t). Let F be an arbitrary quantity depending on
the dynamical state of the system, i.e., on q, p, and possibly on t. The rate
of change in time of F is given by

˙F = [F, H] +

Theorem 6.3 (Poisson formulation of the eqs. of motion). Con-
sider a system described in terms of the canonical variables q, p, and whose

case by the equations

3. Constants of motion in Poisson’s formulation

We shall use again a theorem-like sketch of the basic results on the constants
of motion in Poisson’s formulation. These results are the following.
Theorem 6.4 If one dynamical quantity F is not an explicit function of time
and if the PB of F and H is zero, [F, H] = 0, then F is a constant/integral
of motion as one can see from the theorem 6.2.
Corollary 6.4. If the Hamiltonian is not an explicit function of time, then
it is a constant of motion.

Forward: It is known from the previous chapters that in principle it is
possible to reduce the complexity of many dynamical problems by choosing
an appropriate canonical transformation. In particular, we can try to look
for those canonical transformations for which the Kamiltonian K is zero, a
situation leading to the Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

7.1 Introduction

In order to reach the goals of this chapter we need to make use of the
following result allowing us to ﬁnd the set of canonical variables for which
the Kamiltonian takes a particular form.
Theorem 7.1 Consider a system whose dynamical state is deﬁned by p, q
and whose behaviour under the action of a given force is governed by the
Hamiltonian H = H(q, p, t). Let K = K(Q, P, t) be a known function of
the canonical variables Q, P , and time. Then, any function F (q, Q, t) that
satisﬁes the partial diﬀerential equation

is a generating function for a canonical transformation of q, p to Q, P , and
the corresponding Kamiltonian is K = K(Q, P, t).
In the following sections we shall use this theorem to ﬁnd those canonical
transformations whose Kamiltonian is zero13, that leads us to the Hamilton-
Jacobi equations.

7.2 Time-dependent HJ equations.

As a consequence of Theorem 7.1 and of requiring a zero Kamiltonian we
get the following theorem
Theorem 7.2 Consider a system of f degrees of freedom deﬁned by the set
of variables q, p and of Hamiltonian H = H(q, p, t). If we build the partial

where α = α1, α2, ..., αf is a set of constants and if in addition the solution
satisﬁes the condition

then q(t) can be obtained from the equations

where β = β1, β2, ..., βf is a set of constants. The set of equations (2) provide
us with f algebraic equations in the f unknown variables q1, q2, ..., qf . The
values of the constants α and β are determined by the boundary conditions.
Moreover, if q(t) is given it is possible to ﬁnd p(t) starting from

(3)

The partial diﬀerential equation (1) is called the time-dependent Hamilton-
Jacobi equation. The function S(q, α, t) is known as Hamilton’s principal
function.
To achieve a better meaning of the theorem, as well as of the constants α
and β, we proceed with its proof.
Proof of the Theorem 7.2. According to the Theorem 7.1, any function

should be a generating function of a set of canonical variables Q, P for which
the Kamiltonian K is zero, i.e., K(Q, P, t) = 0. The function

F (q, Q, t) = [S(q, α, t)]α=Q ≡

S(q, Q, t)

belongs to this class. Then S(q, Q, t) is the generating function for a canon-
ical transformation leading to the new set of canonical variables Q, P , for

which reduces to (2). If, in addition, we substitute (6) in (4) we get (2).
This complets the proof.

7.3 Time-independent HJ equations

If the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time, we can partially solve
the time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This result can be spelled
out as the following theorem
Theorem 7.3 Consider a system of f degrees of freedom deﬁned in terms
of q, p, and whose behaviour under a given force is governed by the time-
independent Hamiltonian H(q, p).

W = W (q, α) ,

∂2W (q, α)

∂S(q, α, t)

and β = β1, β2, ..., βf is a set of constants. The set of equations (9) pro-
vide f algebraic equations in the f unknown variables q1, q2, ..., qf . The
values of the constants α and β are determined by the boundary conditions.
The partial diﬀerential equation (8) is the time-independent Hamilton-Jacobi
equation, and the function W (q, α) is known as the characteristic Hamilton
function.

7.4 Generalization of the HJ equations

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation can be generalized according to the follow-
ing theorem allowing sometimes the simpliﬁcation of some Hamilton-Jacobi
problems.
Theorem 7.4 Consider a system of f degrees of freedom whose dynamics
is deﬁned by x, y, where xi, yi = qi, pi or pi,

Forward: The Hamilton-Jacobi equation provides a link to going from a
set of canonical variables q, p to a second set Q, P , where both are constants
of motion.
In this chapter, we brieﬂy present another important procedure by which
one goes from an initial pair of canonical variables to a ﬁnal one, where not
both variables are simultaneously constants of motion.

8.2 Cyclic systems

q1, q2, ..., qf and momenta p

We know that the dynamical state of a system is characterized by a set of
p1, p2, ..., pf . A
generalized coordinates q
system in motion will describe an orbit in the phase space q, p At the same
time, there is an orbit in each of the subspaces qi, pi. In every plane qi, pi,
the orbit can be represented by an equation of the form pi = pi(qi) or a pair
of equations pi = pi(t), qi = qi(t). If for each value of i, the orbit pi = pi(qi)
pi, then we say that the system is cyclic.
is a closed curve in the plane qi −
In the ﬁgure 8 we show the two possibilities for a system to be cyclic. In
8.1a, the system is cyclic because qi oscillates between the limits deﬁned by
qi = a and qi = b, whereas in ﬁgure 8.1b, the system is cyclic because qi
moves from qi = a to qi = b, and repeats the same motion afterwards.

At this point, it is worthwhile to make two helpful remarks.

Remark 1: The cyclic term has been introduced only for simplifying
the notation in the next sections. One should not interpret this term as if

91

the system is cyclic in each subspace qi, pi. The system should come back
to its initial state only in the global space q, p.

Remark 2: If the cyclic system has only one degree of freedom, the time
p is constant; therefore
required by the system to accomplish the cycle in q
−
the motion in the space q
p will be periodic in time. If the system has
more degrees of freedom, then, in general, the time required for a particular
cycle in one of the subspaces qi, pi will not be a constant, but will depend on
the motion of the other coordinates. As a result, the motion in the subspace
qi, pi will not be periodic in time. One should be careful with this point,
since not all the motions in the subspaces qi, pi are periodic.

8.3 Action-angle variables

We consider now a cyclic system of f degrees of freedom, whose dynamical
state is characterized by the canonical set q, p. Let H(q, p) be the Hamilto-
nian of the system and let

W (q, α)

Wi(qi, α) ,

(where α = α1, α2, ..., αf are constants) be a solution of the time-independent
Hamilton-Jacobi equation

then the new coordinates w1, w2, ..., wf are called angle variables, and the
new momenta J1, J2, ..., Jf are called action variables.
From (2) we get

pi(qi, α) =

∂Wi[qi, J(α)]

∂Wi(qi, α)

Substituting (4) in (1) one gets

Ji(α) =

pi(qi, α)dqi .

The equation pi = pi(qi, α) gives the projected orbit p = p(q) on the subspace
pi, qi. The integral in the right hand side of the equation (5) is thus the area
bordered by the closed orbit, or beneath the orbit, as shown in ﬁgure 8.1.
Thus, the function Ji(α) has a geometric interpretation as the area covered
in the subspace qi, pi during a complete cycle in the subspace. This area
depends on the constants α or equivalently on the initial conditions and can
be arbitrary 14.

8.4 Motion in terms of action-angle variables

We give the following theorem-like statement for the motion of a system in
terms of action-angle variables.

ics was related to the assumption that the value of Ji could be only a multiple of h/2π,
where h is Planck’s constant.

and the equations of motion will be

where γi y φi are constants determined by the initial conditions, whereas
the νi are constants known as the frequencies of the system being deﬁned as
follows

8.5 Importance of the action-angle variables

The importance of the action-angle variables resides in providing a powerful
technique for directly getting the frequencies of periodic motions without
solving for the equations of motion of the system.
This important conclusion can be derived through the following argument.
Consider the change of w when q describes a complete cycle

On the other hand, we know that

9. CANONICAL PERTURBATION THEORY

Forward: The great majority of problems that we have to solve in Physics
are not exactly solvable. Because of this and taking into account that we
live in the epoch of computers the last decades have seen a lot of progress in
developing techniques leading to approximate solutions. The perturbation
method is used for not exactly solvable Hamiltonian problems when the
Hamiltonian diﬀers slightly from an exactly solvable one. The diﬀerence
between the two Hamiltonians is known as the perturbation Hamiltonian.
All perturbation methods are based on the smallness of the latter with
respect to both Hamiltonians.

9.1 Time-dependent perturbation theory

The most appropriate formulation of classical mechanics for the develop-
ment of perturbation methods is the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. Thus, we
take H0(p, q, t) as the Hamiltonian corresponding to the solvable (unper-
turbed) problem and consider the Hamilton principal function S(q, α0, t), as
the generating function of a canonical transformation of (p, q) to the new
canonical pair (α0, β0) for which the new Hamiltonian (or Kamiltonian) K0
of the unperturbed system is zero

∂S
∂t

∂S
∂q

+ H0(

, q, t) = K0 = 0 .

This is the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, where we used p = ∂S/∂q. The whole
set of new canonical coordinates (α0, β0) are constant in the unperturbed
case because K0 = 0 and:

˙α0 =

˙β0 =

−

,

∂K0
∂β0

.

We now consider the Hamiltonian of the perturbed system written as follows:

H(q, p, t) = H0(q, p, t) + ∆H(q, p, t);

(∆H

H0).

≪

Although (α0, β0) are still canonical coordinates (since the transformation
generated by S is independent of the particular form of the Hamiltonian),
they will not be constant and the Kamiltonian K of the perturbed system
will not be zero. In order not to forget that in the perturbed system the
transformed coordinates are not constant, we denote them by α and β in-
stead of α0 and β0, which are the corresponding constants in the unperturbed
system. Thus, for the perturbed system we have:

K(α, β, t) = H +

= (H0 +

) + ∆H = ∆H(α, β, t).

where i = 1, 2, ..., n and n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.
These are rigorous equations. If the system of 2n equations could be solved
for αi and βi as functions of time, the transformation equation (p, q)
(α, β)
would give pi and qi as functions of time and the problem would be solved.
However, the exact solution of the equations (5) is not easier to get w.r.t.
the original equations. From (5) we see that when α and β are not constant
their variation in time is slow if we assume that ∆H changes inﬁnitesimally
w.r.t. α y β. A ﬁrst approximation for the temporal variations of (α, β)
can be obtained by substituting α y β in the second terms of (5) by their
constant unperturbed values

where αi1 and βi1 are the ﬁrst-order solutions, i.e., in the ﬁrst power of the
perturbation to αi and βi, and the vertical bars with zero subindices show
that after the derivation one should substitute α and β by their constant
unperturbed values. Once this is done, the equations (6) can be integrated
leading to αi and βi as functions of time (in the ﬁrst order). Next, using
the equations of transformation one can get p and q as functions of time in
the same ﬁrst-order approximation. The second-order approximation can
be obtained now by substituting in the second terms of (6) the ﬁrst-order
approximation of α and β w.r.t. time. In general, the perturbation solution
of order N is obtained by integrating the following equations

a harmonic perturbation. Although this example is trivial can be used to
illustrate the aforementioned procedure. The unperturbed Hamiltonian is

Since the system is conservative, it is convenient to consider the principal

This type of separation of variables is quite useful when the Hamiltonian
does not depend explicitly on time. Then, one writes F (t) =

given up to now is only the procedure to obtain the equations of motion using

As one may expect, these equations have an exact solution of the harmonic
type. To be sure of that we perform the time derivative of the ﬁrst equa-
tion allowing us to conclude that α has a simple harmonic variation. The
same holds for x as a consequence of the transformations (13), which are
invariant in form in the perturbed system (up to the subindices of the trans-
formed coordinates). However, we are interested to illustrate the pertur-
bation method, so that we consider that k (the elastic constant) is a small
parameter. We seek approximate solutions in diﬀerent perturbative orders,
without missing the fact that the transformed variables (α, β) in the per-
turbed system are not constants of motion. In other words, even though
(α, β) contain information on the unperturbed system, the eﬀect of the per-
turbation is to make these parameters varying in time.

The ﬁrst-order perturbation is obtained in general as given by (6). Thus, we

have to substitute α and β by their unperturbed values in the second terms
of (16). To simplify, we take x(t = 0) = 0 and therefore β0 = 0, leading to

The transformed variables (α, β) contain information about the unperturbed

orbit parameters. For example, if we consider as unperturbed system that
corresponding to the Kepler problem, a convenient coordinate pair (α, β)
could be the (J, δ) variables, which are the action and the phase angle of the
angle w, respectively (remember that w = νt + δ, where ν is the frequency).
These variables are related to the set of orbital parameters such as semimajor
axis, eccentricity, inclination, and so on.
The eﬀect of the perturbation is to produce a time variation of all these
If the perturbation is small, the variation of the parameters

during a period of the unperturbed motion will also be small.
In such a
case, for small time intervals, the system moves along the so-called osculat-
ing orbit, having the same functional form as the orbit of the unperturbed
system; the diﬀerence is that the parameters of the osculating curve vary in
time.

The osculating parameters can vary in two ways

Periodic variation:
if the parameter comes back to its initial value
after a time interval that in ﬁrst approximation is usually the unper-
turbed period. These periodic eﬀects of the perturbation do not alter
the mean values of the parameters. Therefore, the trajectory is quite
similar to the unperturbed one. These eﬀects can be eliminated by
taking the average of the perturbations in a period of the unperturbed
motion.

Secular variation: At the end of every succesive orbital period there
is a net increment of the value of the parameter. Therefore, at the
end of many periods, the orbital parameters can be very diﬀerent of
their unperturbed values. The instantaneous value of the variation of
a parameter, for example the frequency, is seldom of interest, because
its variation is very small in almost all cases in which the perturbation
formalism works. (This variation is so small that it is practically im-
possible to detect it in a single orbital period. This is why the secular
variation is measured after at least several periods.)

Example 2

From the theory of the Kepler two-body problem it is known that if we add
a potential 1/r2, the orbit of the motion of negative energy is a rotating
ellipse whose periapsis is precessing. In this example, we ﬁnd the precession
velocity for a more general perturbation

The latter case, n = 3, is of particular importance because the theory of
General Relativity predicts a correction of the Newtonian motion precisely of
3 order. This prediction is related to the famous problem of the precession
r−
of the orbit of Mercury. Substituting the appropriate values of the period,
mass, great semiaxis, that is included in h, and so on, (30) predicts a mean
precession velocity of

The mean value is by far larger than the aforementioned one (by a factor
larger than one hundred). But before making any comparison one should
eliminate from the mean value the contributions due to the following factors:
a) the eﬀect known as the precession of the equinoxes (the motion of the ref-
erence point of longitudes w.r.t. the Milky Galaxy), b) the perturbations of
the Mercury orbit due to the interaction with the other planets. Once these
are eliminated, of which the ﬁrst is the most signiﬁcant, one may hopefully
obtain the contribution of the relativistic eﬀect. In 1973, this contribution
has been estimated as 41.4
0.9 arcsec./century. This is consistent with the
prediction given by (30).

9.2 Time-independent perturbation theory

While in the time-dependent perturbation theory one seeks the time depen-
dence of the parameters of the unperturbed system initially considered as

104

constant, the aim of the time-independent approach is to ﬁnd the constant
quantities of the perturbed system. This theory can be applied only to con-
servative periodic systems (both in the perturbed and unperturbed state).
For example, it can be applied to planetary motion when one introduces any
type of conservative perturbation to the Kepler problem, in which case it is
known as the von Zeipel or Poincar´e method.

Here, we consider here the case of a periodic system of one degree of freedom
and time-independent Hamiltonian of the form

(31)

(32)

(34)

where λ is a small constant specifying the strength of the perturbation. We
assume that

H = H(p, q, λ),

H0(p, q) = H(p, q, 0)

corresponds to a system that has an exact (closed-form) unperturbed solu-
tion in the action-angle variables (J0, w0), i.e.,

H0(p, q) = K0(J0)

∂K0
∂J0

;

ν0 = ˙w0 =

(w0 = ν0t + δ0).

(33)

Since the canonical transformation from (p, q) to (J0, w0) is independent of
the particular form of the Hamiltonian, the perturbed Hamiltonian H(p, q, λ)
can be written as H(J0, w0, λ). Due to the fact that the perturbed Hamil-
tonian depends on w0, J0, it is not constant any more. On the other hand,
in principle, one can get new action-angle variables (J, w) that may be more
appropriate for the perturbed system, such as

H(p, q, λ) = E(J, λ)
∂E
∂J

ν = ˙w =

˙J =

∂E
∂w

−

= 0 ;

(J = constant).

Since the transformation connecting (p, q) to (J0, w0) is known, we have
to ﬁnd the canonical transformation S connecting (J0, w0) to (J, w). If we
assume that λ is small the transformation we look for should not diﬀer much
from the identity transformation. Thus, we write the following expansion

105

S = S(w0, J, λ) = S0(w0, J) + λS1(w0, J) + λ2S2(w0, J) + ... .

(35)

For λ = 0 we ask S to provide an identity transformation that leads to

S0 = w0J .

(36)

The canonical transformations generated by S read

w =

(w0, J) + ... .

J0 =

= J + λ

(w0, J) + ... .

(37)

Due to the fact that w0 is an angle variable of the unperturbed system we
know that ∆w0 = 1 over a cycle. On the other hand, we know that the
canonical transformations have the property to conserve the phase space
volume. Therefore, we can write:

J =

pdq =

J0dw0 .

Integrating the second equation of (37) along an orbit of the perturbed
system, we get

(42)

Moreover, the Hamiltonian can be expanded in λ as a function of w0 and
J0:

H(w0, J0, λ) = K0(J0) + λK1(w0, J0) + λ2K2(w0, J0) + ... ,

(43)

where the Ki are known because H is a known function of w0 and J0 for a
given λ. On the other hand, one can write

H(p, q, λ) = H(w0, J0, λ)

= E(J, λ) ,

(44)

which is the expression for the energy in the new action-angle coordinates
(where J will be constant and w will be a linear function of time).

E can also be expanded in powers of λ:

E(J, λ) = E0(J) + λE1(J) + λ2E2(J) + ... .

(45)

Taking into account (44) we can obtain equalities for the coeﬃcients of the
same powers of λ in (43) and (45). However, these expressions for the energy
depend on two diﬀerent sets of variables. To solve this issue we express H0
in terms of J by writing a Taylor expansion of H(w0, J0, λ) w.r.t. J0 in the
inﬁnitesimal neighborhood of J:

H(w0, J0, λ) = H(w0, J, λ) + (J0 −

w.r.t. J0 calculated for J0 = J, can also be written as derivatives w.r.t. J,
once we substitute J0 by J in H0(J0). In the previous equation, all the terms
containing J0 should be rewritten in terms of J by using the transformation
deﬁned by (37) connecting the coordinates (J0, w0) and (J, w). Thus, from

Now, we can solve the problem in terms of the coeﬃcients Ei(J) allowing us
to calculate the frequency of the perturbed motion in various perturbation
orders. Since the expansion of the terms of Ei does not imply a dependence
on w0, then the occurrence of w0 in (48) is artiﬁcial. The Ki(w0, J) of
(48) are known functions, whereas the Si(w0, J) and Ei(J) are the unknown
quantities.

Making equal the corresponding powers of λ, we get

We can see that to obtain E1 we need to know not only K1 but also S1.
Moreover, we should keep in mind that the Ei are constant, being functions
of J only, which is a constant of motion. We also have to notice that ∂K0/∂J
does not depend on w0 (since K0 = K0(J) = K0(J0)
|J0=J ). Averaging over
w0 on both sides of the second equation in (49), one gets

Forward: An adiabatic invariant is a function of the parameters and con-
stants of motion of a system, which remains almost constant in the limit in
which the parameters change inﬁnitesimally in time, even though in the end
they may change by large amounts.

10.1 BRIEF HISTORY

The notion of adiabatic invariance goes back to the early years of quantum
mechanics. Around 1910 people studying the emission and absorption of
radiation noticed that the atoms could live in quasi-stable states in which
their energy was alsmost constant. At the 1911 Solvay Congress, the problem
of adiabatic invariance became widely known due to Einstein that draw the
attention of the physics community to the adiabatic invariant E/ν of the one-
dimensional pendulum of slowly varying length. He suggested that similar
invariants could occur for atomic systems setting their stability limits. Later,
Ehrenfest was able to ﬁnd such adiabatic invariants and their employment
led to the ﬁrst quantum approach of Bohr and Sommerfeld.

The method of adiabatic invariants resurged after several decades in the area
of magnetospheric physics. The Scandinavian scientists were especially in-
terested in boreal aurora phenomena, i.e., the motion of electrons and ions
in the terrestrial magnetosphere. One of them, H. Alfven, showed in his
book Cosmic Electrodynamics that under appropriate conditions a certain
combination of dynamical parameters of the charged particles remains con-
stant in the ﬁrst order . Apparently, Alfven did not realized that he found
an adiabatic invariant. This was pointed out by L. Landau and E. Lifshitz
who discussed in detail this issue.

10.2 GENERALITIES

We ﬁrst show in a simple way which is the adiabatic invariant in the case of
the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The employed method will be to
prove that in the limit of the inﬁnitesimally slow variation of the parameters,
the adiabatic invariant of the one-dimensional system goes to a quantity that
is exactly conserved in a corresponding two-dimensional system.

Consider a particle at the end of a rope of negligible mass that rotates uni-
formly on a table. Let a be the radius of the circle, m the mass of the
particle, and ω the angular frequency. If the origin is in the center of the
circle the projection of the motion on the x axis corresponds to the motion
of a simple harmonic oscillator. The motion continues to be harmonic even
when the rope is slowly made shorter by pulling it through a small hole
drilled at the origin. The problem is to ﬁnd the invariant quantity in this
case. It is by far more diﬃcult to get the answer for the circular motion
in comparison with the corresponding projected oscillator. Since there are
only central forces even when the rope is slowly shortened the conserved
quantity is the angular momentum l. Therefore, in the slow limit one can
write

112

l = mωa2 .

(1)

From this equation one can see that although l is an exact invariant mωa2
is only a slow limit, i.e., adiabatic invariant. More exactly, it is only in the
slow limit that we can claim that the two quantities are equal and we are
allowed to think of the right hand side as an invariant. In the slow limit,
the projected one-dimensional oscillator has a slowly varying amplitude, a
frequency ν = ω/2π, and a total energy E = 1
2 mω2a2. Therefore, the adia-
batic invariance of the right hand side of (1) implies the adiabatic invariance
of the quotient E/ω for the projected oscillator.

A short analytic proof of this fact is the following. One writes the two-
dimensional Hamiltonian

H = (2m)−

1(p2

x + p2

y) +

mω2(x2 + y2) .

1
2

Hamilton’s equations lead to

¨x + ω2x = o,

¨y + ω2y = 0 .

(2)

(3)

Changing to polar coordinates we note that l = m ˙θr2. The previous Hamil-
ton equations can be written as a single complex equation ¨z + ω2z = 0,
where z = x + iy. We consider a solution of the form z = a exp i(ωt + b),
where a, b, and ω are real functions that are slowly varying in time. The real
and imaginary parts are x = a cos(ωt + b) and y = a sin(ωt + b), respectively.
Since ω, a, and b vary slowly, l can be written in a very good approximation
as l = mωa2. The energy of the projected oscillator is E = 1
2 mω2x2.
In the slow varying limit of the parameters, we can substitute x in E by the
cosine function to get E = 1
2 mω2a2. Thus, if mωa2 is an adiabatic invariant
then E/ω is an adiabatic invariant for the one-dimensional oscillator.

2 m ˙x2 + 1

We now clarify the meaning of the term almost constant in the deﬁnition of
the adiabatic invariant in the forward to this chapter.
Consider a system of one degree of freedom, which initially is consevative
and periodic and depends on an initially constant parameter a. The slow
variation of this parameter due, for example, to a low amplitude perturba-
tion does not alter the periodic nature of the motion. By a slow variation
we mean the one for which a varies slowly during a period τ of the motion:

τ (da/dt)

a .

≪

(4)

However, even when the variations of a are small during a given period, after
a suﬃcently long time the motion may display large changes.

113

When the parameter a is constant, the system will be described by the
action-angle variables (w0, J0) and the Hamiltonian H = H(J0, a). Assume
now that the generating function of the transformation (q, p)
(w0, J0) is
of the form W ∗(q, w0, a).

→

When a is allowed to vary in time, (w0, J0) will still be valid canonical
variables, but W ∗ turns into a function of time through a. Then, neither
J0 will be a constant nor w0 a linear function of time. The appropriate
Hamiltonian will be

K(w0, J0, a) = H(J0, a) +

∂W ∗
∂t
∂W ∗
∂a

= H(J0, a) + ˙a

.

(5)

The second term in (5) can be seen as a perturbation. Then, the temporal
dependence of J0 is given by

˙J0 =

∂K
∂w0

−

=

˙a

−

∂
∂w0 (cid:18)

(cid:19)

.

Proceeding similarly to the time-dependent perturbation theory, we seek
˙J0 during the period of the
the variation to ﬁrst-order of the mean value of
unperturbed motion. Since a varies slowly, we can think of it as constant
during this interval. Thus, we can write

Thus,

which is one of the basic properties of the adiabatic invariance. In this way,
the term almost constant in the deﬁnition of the adiabatic invariant should
be interpreted as constant in the ﬁrst order.

11. MECHANICS OF CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS

Forward: All the formulations of mechanics up to now have dealt with
systems having a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom or inﬁnitely countable.
However, many physical systems are continuous; for example, an elastic
solid in vibrational motion. Every point of such a solid participates in the
oscillation(s) and the total motion can be described only by specifying the
coordinates of all points. It is not so diﬃcult to modify the previous formu-
lations in order to get a formalism that works for continuous media. The
most direct method consists in approximating the continuum by a collection
of discrete subunits (‘particles’) and then study how the equations of motion
change when one goes to the continuous limit.

11.1 Lagrangian formulation: from discrete to the
continuous case

As one of the most simple case for which one can go easily from a discrete
system to a continuous counterpart we consider an inﬁnitely long elastic
rod doing longitudinal vibrations, i.e., oscillations of its points along the
rod axis. A system made of discrete particles that may be considered as
a discrete approximation of the rod is an inﬁnite chain of material points
separated by the same distance a and connected through identical massless
resorts of elastic constant k (see the ﬁgure).

We suppose that the material points can move only along the chain. Thus,
the discrete system is an extension of the polyatomic lineal molecule pre-
sented in chapter 6 of Goldstein’s textbook. Thus, the equations of motion
of the chain can be obtained by applying the common techniques used in
the study of small oscillations. Denoting by ηi the displacement of the ith
particle with respect to its equilibrium position, the kinetic energy is

lenght unit µ of the continuous system, but the limiting value of ka is not
so obvious. We recall that in the case of an elastic rod for which Hooke’s
law holds, the enlargement of the rod per unit of length is proportional to
the force (tension) according to

F = Y ξ,

where ξ is the enlargement per length unit and Y is the Young modulus.

and therefore κa should correspond to the Young modulus de Young of the
continuous rod. When one passes from the discrete to the continuous case
the integer index i for the particular material point of the system turns into
the continuous position coordinate x; the discrete variable ηi is replaced by
η (x). Moreover, the following quantity

The equation (8) is the well-known formula for the sound velocity (the prop-
agational velocity of the elastic longitudinal waves).
This simple example is suﬃcient to illustrate the main features of the tran-
sition from a discrete to a continuous system. The most important fact that
we have to understand is the role of the coordinate x. It is not a gener-
alized coordinate; it is merely a continuous index substituting the discrete
one i. To any value of x corresponds a generalized coordinate η (x). Since
η also depends on the continuous variable t, maybe we have to write it in
a more precise way than η (x.t) by showing that x, equally to t, can be
viewed as a parameter of the Lagrangian. If the system would have been
3-dimensional and not one-dimensional, the generalized coordinates would
have to be distinguished by three continuous indices x, y, z and write in the
form η (x, y, z, t). We note that the quantities x, y, z, t are totally indepen-
dent and show up only in η as explicit variables. The derivatives of η with
respect to any of them could thus be written as total derivatives without
any ambiguity. The equation (6) also shows the Lagrangian is an integral
over the continuous index x; in the three-dimensional case, the Lagrangian
would write

and corresponds to the continuous limit of Li appearing in equation (4).
Thus, it is more the Lagrangian density than the Lagrangian that we used
to describe the motion in this case.

If besides the interactions between ﬁrst neighbours there would have been

some local forces,

can be an explicit function of x and t. Therefore, the
Lagrangian density for any one-dimensional continuous system should be of

From Hamilton’s principle for the continuous system one would expect to
get the continuous limit of the equations of motion. For this (as in section
2-2 of Goldstein) we can use a varied path for a convenient integration, by
choosing η from a family of functions of η depending on a parameter as
follows

η (x, t; α) = η (x, t; 0) + αζ (x, t) .

(13)

where η (x, t; 0) is the correct function satisfying Hamilton’s principle and
ζ is an arbitrary function of ‘good’ behaviour that is zero in the extreme
points of t and x. If we consider I as a function of α, then in order to be an
extremal solution for the derivative of I with respect to α it should become
zero in α = 0. By directly deriving I we get

Thus, as we would have liked, the Euler-Lagrange equation (16) can be
reduced to the equation of motion (7).
The Lagrange formulation that we presented up to now is valid for contin-
uous systems. It can be easily generalized to two, three, and more dimen-
sions. It is convenient to think of a four-dimensional space of coordinates
xo = t, x1 = x, x2 = y, x3 = z.
In addition, we introduce the following notation

ηρ,ν ≡

dηρ

Employing this notation and the four x coordinates the Lagrangian density
(11) takes the form:

Thus, the total Lagrangian is an integral extended to all three-dimensional
space:

where the variation of the ηρ nullify on the surface S entailing the integration

Let a set of variational functions be

ηρ (xν; α) = ηρ (xν ) + αζ (xν) .

They depend on a single parameter and reduce to ηρ (xν) when the param-
eter α goes to zero. The variation of I is equivalent to put to zero the

11.3 Hamiltonian formulation and Poisson brackets

11.3.1 Hamiltonian formulation

Hamilton’s formulation for continuous systems is similar to that for dis-
crete systems. To show the procedure we go back to the chain of material
points we considered at the beginning of the chapter, where for each ηi one
introduces a canonical momentum

The Hamiltonian of the system will be

Recalling that in the limit a

and the sum in the equation (29)

The individual canonical momenta pi, given by equation (27), go to zero in
the continuous limit, nevertheless we can deﬁne a momentum density π that
remains ﬁnite:

The equation (30) has the form of a spatial integral of the Hamiltonian

Even when one can introduce a Hamiltonian formulation in this direct way
for classical ﬁelds, we should keep in mind the the procedure has to give a
special treatment to the time variable. This is diﬀerent of the Lagrangian
formulation where all the independent variables were considered on the same
foot. This is why the Hamilton method will be treated in a distinct manner.
The obvious way to do a three-dimensional generalizeation of the ﬁeld ηρ is
the following.
We deﬁne a canonical momentum

∂

Similarly to a discrete system we can seek a conservation theorem for π that
look like the corresponding canonical momentum of the discrete systems. If a
given ﬁeld ηρ is a cyclic variable (
does not present an explicit dependence
on ηρ), the Lagrange ﬁeld equation has the form of a conservation of a
current:

Thus, the eq. (53) podr´a could be written

which exactly corresponds, in this notation, to the equation for the discrete
systems. Since by deﬁnition the Poisson bracket of H with itself is zero, the
eq. (46) turns into

which is the integral form of eq. (47). Thus, the Poisson bracket formalism
ocurr as a consequence of the Hamiltonian formulation. However, one cannot
perform a description in terms of Poisson brackets for ﬁeld theories by a step
by step correspondence with the discrete case.
Nevertheless there is one way to work out the classical ﬁelds which includes
almost all the ingredients of Hamilton’s formulation and Poisson brackets of
the discrete case. The basic idea is to replace the continuous spatial variable
or the continuous index by a countable discrete index.
The requirement that η be zero at the end points is a contour condition that
might be achieved physically only by ﬁxing the rod between two rigid walls.
Then, the amplitud of oscillation can be represented by means of a Fourier
series:

η (x) =

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

Instead of the continuous index x we have the discrete η. We could use this
representation of x only when η (x) is a regular function, which happens for
many ﬁeld quantities.
We assume that there is only one real ﬁeld η that can be developed in a
three-dimensional Fourier series

Here, ~k is a wave vector that can take only discrete modulus and directions,
so that in only one lineal dimension there will be an integer (or sometimes,
half-integer) wavelengths. We say that ~k has a discrete spectrum. The scalar
subindex k represents a certain order of the set of integer subindices that are
used to enumerate the discrete values of ~k; V is the volume of the system,
which appear as a normalization factor.
The orthogonality of the exponentials in the entire volume can be stated

11.4 Noether’s theorem

We have already seen that the properties of the Lagrangian (or of the Hamil-
tonian) imply the existence of conservative quantities. Thus, if the La-
grangian does not contain explicitly a particular displacement coordinate,
the corresponding caonical momentum is conserved. The absence of an ex-
plicit dependence on a coordinate means that the Lagrangian is not changed
by a transformation that alter the value of that coordinate; we say that it
is invariant or symmetric for that transformation.
The symmetry under a coordinate transformation refers to the eﬀects of an
inﬁnitesimal transformation as follows

′

x

µ = xµ + δxµ,

xµ →

(71)

where the variation δxµ can be a function of all the other xν. Noether’s
theorem deals with the eﬀect of the transformation of the ﬁeld quantities
itselves. Such a transformation can be written

xµ

Here δηρ
is a measure of the eﬀect of the variations of xµ and of ηρ. It
can be a function of all the other ﬁelds ηλ. The variation of one of the ﬁeld
variables in a particular point of space xµ is a diﬀerent quantity δηρ:

The characterization of the transformations by means of inﬁnitesimal vari-
ations, starting from untransformed quantities means that we consider only
continuous transformations. Therefore, the symmetry under inversion of the
three-dimensional space is not a symmetry of the continuous type to which
Noether’s theorem can be applied. As a consequence of the transforma-
tions both in the coordinates and the ﬁelds, the Lagrangian will, in general,
appear as a diﬀerent function of the ﬁeld and spacetime coordinates:

general form possible, but makes easier the proof, without loosing too much
of its generality and the usefulness of the conclusions. We shall suppose the
following three conditions:

1. The spacetime is Euclidean, meaning that the relativity is reduced to

the Minkowski space, which is complex but ﬂat.

2. The Lagrangian density is of the same functional form for the trans-

formed quantities as for the original ones, that is

It is useful to develop more the condition giving the form of the inﬁnites-
imal transformation as a function of the R inﬁnitesimal parameters εr,r =
1, 2, ..., R, such that the variations of xµ y ηρ be lineal in εr:

δxν = εrXrν ,

δηρ = ǫrΨrρ.

The equations (82) are the main conclusion of Noether’s theorem, telling
that if the system has symmetry properties fulﬁlling the conditions (1) and
(2) for transformations of the type given by the equations (81), then there
exist r conserved quantities.

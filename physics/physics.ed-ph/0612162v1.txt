We show that the baking of potato wedges constitutes a crunchy example of edge eﬀects, which
are usually demonstrated in electrostatics. A simple model of the diﬀusive transport of water vapor
around the potato wedges shows that the water vapor ﬂux diverges at the sharp edges in analogy
with its electrostatic counterpart. This increased evaporation at the edges leads to the crispy taste
of these parts of the potatoes.

INTRODUCTION

Edge eﬀects are usually introduced in electrostatic
courses and provide an interesting and nontrivial exam-
ple of electrostatic eﬀects. This phenomenon corresponds
to the divergence of the electric ﬁeld and charge accumu-
lation at the edges or corners of a conductor at a ﬁxed po-
tential. This singular behavior has various consequences
and applications such as lightning rods and the ﬁeld emis-
sion eﬀect.

The mathematical description of edge eﬀect involves
the solution of the Laplace equation for the electric po-
tential with ﬁxed potential boundary conditions on the
conductor. For example, for a corner with an opening an-
gle α in a two-dimensional geometry, the electric ﬁeld E
and surface charge on the conductor behaves as E ∝ ργ
with γ = (α − π)/(2π − α) and ρ the distance to the
tip.1 The electric ﬁeld thus diverges at the corners when
α < π.

Alternative examples of edge eﬀects can be found in
other domains of physics. The minimal ingredients are
a geometry with sharp edges; a Laplace-like equation for
the physical quantity of interest (for example, the elec-
tric potential); and a boundary condition on the given
geometry that imposes a ﬁxed value of this quantity at
its surface.

Evaporation of water vapor is one such example, as we
will discuss in the following. Edge eﬀects arise in the con-
text of molecular diﬀusion of water vapor. A diverging
water vapor ﬂux at the edges is predicted. Such eﬀects
have been shown to be responsible for the formation of
ring stains formed by drying coﬀee drops.2

We consider another example of an edge eﬀect induced
by evaporation: the drying of potato wedges baked in an
oven. The geometry of the potatoes is ﬁxed by the cook:
we shall focus here on potatoes cut with sharp edges,
as for potato wedges. We show in Fig. 1 an example of
(home-made) potato wedges (after 20 minutes in the oven
at 200◦C). As can be seen the edges are much darker, and
exhibit very strong drying.

We will demonstrate that this drying is due to a diverg-
ing ﬂux of water vapor at the extremities of the potato
wedge in analogy with the edge eﬀect in electrostatics.
This divergence induces a strong dehydration of the pota-
toes in its wedges and corners.

are seen to be darker, showing dehydration in these regions.
The eﬀect is stronger at the extremities of the wedge.

II. WATER VAPOR DIFFUSION AROUND
POTATOES

Like most foods, potatoes contain a large amount of
water. While increasing the temperature in the oven,
the liquid-vapor thermodynamic equilibrium of water is
displaced toward the vapor phase, which leads to the
evaporation of the liquid water inside the potatoes to
the surrounding air.

Let us consider the distribution of water vapor in the
air around potatoes. Its concentration cw obeys a diﬀu-
sion equation:

with Dv the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the water vapor in
air. We make the further assumption that the oven is in
a quasi-stationary state, which implies that

∂cw
∂t

= Dv∇2cw,

∇2cw = 0

(1)

(2)

On the potato wedge surface, the value of the va-
por concentration is ﬁxed by the liquid-vapor thermody-
namic equilibrium, and equals the saturation value csat
calculated at the temperature of the oven. Far from the
potato, we expect that the air in the oven is not saturated
and the concentration of vapor reaches a ﬁxed value c∞
lower than saturation. Because we are interested in the
diﬀusion of water in the vicinity of the potato’s surface,
this far ﬁeld boundary condition will not be required to

characterize edge eﬀects. The rate of evaporation of wa-
ter at the potato’s surface is given by the ﬂux of water
vapor, JD = −Dv∇cw.

The equation for the vapor concentration with the
speciﬁed boundary conditions is identical to that of the
electrostatic potential around a conductor at ﬁxed poten-
tial. The solution of Eq. (2) depends only on the geome-
try of the conductor/potato’s surface.1,2 The vapor ﬂux
is analogous to the electric ﬁeld and is therefore expected
to diverge at the edges. Both the edges and extremities
of a potato will be considered: these will be modeled
respectively in terms of two- and three-dimensional ge-
ometries. We now recall the basic steps in deriving the
solution of Eq. (2) in the context of our problem. A de-
tailed description can be found in Ref. 1.

yields a0 = csat, B0 = BK = 0. This condition also
requires that K satisfy sin(Kβ) = 0, so that K = nπ/β,
with n = 1, 2, . . . . We put these results together and
write the vapor concentration as

The coeﬃcients an are determined from the concentra-
tion far from the corner, and it is not necessary to deter-
mine their value for the discussion of the edge eﬀects..

The water ﬂux at the surface of the potato can now be
determined using JD = −Dv∇cw. Only the component
of the ﬂux perpendicular to the surface is non-vanishing.

As expected, this ﬂux diverges at the edge for β > π, that
is, for a sharp wedge. The exponent of the divergence
π/β −1 takes its maximum value, −1/2, in the very sharp
limit, β → 2π. Note that the same exponent (1/2) is
found for the divergence of the surface charge close to
the edge of a thin disk at ﬁxed potential.1

IV. DRYING OF EDGES:
THREE-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY

First consider a two-dimensional geometry as in
Fig. 2(a). This geometry corresponds to evaporation at
the border of a potato’s wedge. The Laplace equation for
the vapor concentration is

We look for a solution using separation of variables, cw =
f (ρ)g(θ), and ﬁnd the equations for f and g:

AK sin(Kθ) + BK cos(Kθ) for K 6= 0 and f (ρ) = a0 +
b0 log ρ, g(θ) = A0 + B0θ for K = 0.

The constant K is ﬁxed by the boundary conditions
on the wedge’s surface. To avoid a divergence of the
concentration at the surface, we need to impose b0 =
bK = 0. Imposing cw = csat for θ = 0 and θ = β (ρ > 0)

It is convenient to rewrite the unknown constant K ′ as
ℓ(ℓ + 1). The solution for f can be written as f (r) =
arℓ+1 + br−ℓ; the solution for g(θ) is the Legendre func-
tion of the ﬁrst kind of order ℓ, Pℓ(cos θ).3 The regularity
of the solution at the origin imposes b = 0. The boundary
condition at the surface of the potato, cw = csat, leads to
the following condition for the index ℓ:

Pℓ(cos β) = 0.

same steps as for the two-dimensional case, we obtain the
general solution as a linear combination of solutions:

The exponent (ℓ1 − 1) characterizing the singularity of
the behavior at the sharp end is given by the smallest zero
of the equation Pℓ1 (cos β) = 0. In general, there is no an-
alytical solution to this equation, because ℓ1 is expected
to be non-integer. For β > π/2, that is, cos β < 0, the
smallest solution of this equation is ℓ1 ∈ [0, 1]. In Fig. 3
we plot Pν(cos β) versus cos β for various ν. For example,
Pν=0.3(cos β) has a zero at cos β ≃ −0.91, which corre-
sponds to β ≈ 156◦. Hence the solution of Pℓ1(cos β) = 0
for β = 156◦ is ℓ1 = 0.3. Figure 3 also shows that the

3

value of cos β verifying Pν(cos β) = 0 goes to −1 as ν
decreases. Hence for β → 180◦, the value for ℓ1, which
is a solution of the equation Pℓ1 (cos β) = 0, goes to zero:
ℓ1 → 0 as β → 180◦. This result can be shown more
rigorously. In the limit ν → 0, x → −1, Pν(x) may be
approximated as Pν (x) ≃ 1 + ν log[(1 + x)/2].5 Therefore,
using cos β ≃ −1 + (π − β)2/2 as β → π, we deduce that
.1 The
ℓ1 may be approximated by ℓ1 ≃ h2 log (cid:16)
important conclusion of these estimates is that for a very
sharp cone, β → π, the exponent of the singularity at the
sharp end is −1 + ℓ1 ≃ −1 and thus the ﬂux divergence
at the tip scales like r−1.

V. DISCUSSION

Edge eﬀects lead to a divergent ﬂux of the water va-
por at the edges and corners of potatoes. This singular
behavior induces a strong drying of the potato near its
wedges. This increased dehydration is responsible for the
crunchy taste of the potatoes at their wedges.

A few cooking remarks are in order. We have shown
that the water ﬂux divergence, and thus dehydration,
is stronger as the angle of the corner or cone becomes
smaller. The singularity of the water ﬂux is stronger for
a cone shape than for a edge: the water ﬂux scales at
most as JD ∼ r−1/2 for the two-dimensional wedge (with
r the distance to the tip), and JD ∼ r−1 for a sharp cone.
Hence the drying of the potatoes is predicted to be much
stronger at the sharp extremities of the wedge than at its
edges as is observed (see Fig. 1).

Deep fried wedges exhibit a similar behavior with
stronger dehydration at the edges. This similarity may
originate in the water vapor bubbles created at the sur-
face of the wedge in hot oil. The above description may
apply within the bubbles, although we expect that non-
stationary eﬀects of the diﬀusion process cannot be ne-
glected in such a situation.

Our simple calculations provide an interesting appli-
cation of the diﬀusion equation. It has been successful
in gaining the interest of the students in a course on the
physics of continuum media. Before presenting the cal-
culation in a lecture, students may be asked to perform
their own experiment at home and brainstorm on their
observations and conclusions. The results may then be
debated during the next lecture.

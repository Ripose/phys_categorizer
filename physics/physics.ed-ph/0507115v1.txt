Evaluating the Root-Mean-Squared of a Sinusoidal Signal

Abstract

The frequently mentioned root-mean-squared value of an alternating

voltage is derived without using calculus.

Alternating Voltages

Students are taught that commercial electric power is available in two common
forms, alternating and direct, but that it is alternating voltages that are supplied
on large scales, such as to homes. When an alternating voltage given by

is applied across a resistor R, for example the coil of a water heater, heat is
generated at a rate

V (t) = V0 sin(ωt)

P (t) =

V 2(t)

(ωt) .

Since practical applications involve time scales much larger than 1/ω, it is the
average of the instantaneous power (2) over many cycles that is of interest. For
the simple periodic function above, this is equivalent to asking for the average
over one cycle. Textbooks quote this average as,

(1)

(2)

(3)

This then motivates one to deﬁne the root-mean-squared voltage, given by
V0/√2. The root-mean-squared voltage is the constant voltage that
Vrms
would lead to the same heating eﬀect as the alternating power averaged over
many cycles.

The ubiquitous 1/2 in the mean-squared value (3) can be obtained through
an explicit integration. However it can also be derived simply by using two
common trigonometric facts. The ﬁrst is that the functions sin(θ) and cos(θ)
2π and they become identical when one
are periodic over the interval 0
≤
2
(θ)
of them is shifted by π/2 relative to the other. Therefore the averages of sin
and cos2(θ) must be identical over one complete cycle. We also have the identity

≤

θ

which, on taking the average over one cycle, gives

2
sin

(θ) + cos2(θ) = 1,

(θ) >= 1,

leading to desired result.

Students might wish for a more explicit, but non-calculus, discussion on
what it means to take the average of an equation such as (4). Although the
interval 0
2π is continuous, one can evaluate the average of a function
by sampling its value at a large number, N , of uniformly distributed points,
and then taking the limit N
. Let θi denote a typical point, then the
left-hand-side of (4) gives

which is the left-hand-side of (5). The average of the right-hand-side of (4)
similarly gives the right-hand-side of (5).

An alternative non-calculus evaluation of the mean-squared value may be
found in [1]. There authors adopt the trigonometric double-angle formula to
2
(θ) in terms of cos(2θ) and then use the fact that the average of a
write sin
sinusoidal function is zero over one cycle. Arguably, the identity (4) is easier
to recall than the double-angle formula. Indeed, in any right-angled triangle,
which is used in elementary deﬁnitions of trigonometric functions, (4) is clearly
equivalent to the famous Pythagoras theorem.

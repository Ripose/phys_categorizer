We examine here a possible endpoint of the trends, in the
teaching literature, away from use of relativistic masses (such
′ ≡ γm in the momentum = mass × velocity expression)
as m
and toward use of proper velocity dx/dto ≡ γv (e.g.
in that
same expression). We show that proper time & proper veloc-
ity, taken as components of a non-coordinate time/velocity
pair, allow one to introduce time dilation and frame-invariant
acceleration/force 3-vectors in the context of one inertial
frame, before subjects involving multiple frames (like Lorentz
transforms, length contraction, and frame-dependent simul-
taneity) need be considered. We further show that many
post-transform equations (like the velocity-addition rule) ac-
quire elegance and/or utility not found in the absence of these
variables. From physics/9611011.

I. INTRODUCTION

Eﬀorts to connect classical and relativistic concepts
will be with us as long as classical kinematics is taught
to introductory students. For example, the observation
that relativistic objects behave at high speed as though
their inertial mass increases in the −→p = m−→v expression,
led to the deﬁnition (used in many early textbooks1) of
relativistic mass m′ ≡ mγ. Such eﬀorts might help to:
(A) get the most from ﬁrst-taught relationships, and (B)
ﬁnd what is true and fundamental in both classical and
relativistic approaches. The concepts of transverse (m′)
and longitudinal (m′′ ≡ mγ3) masses have similarly been
used2 to preserve relations of the form Fx = max for
forces perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the ve-
locity direction.

Unfortunately for these relativistic masses, no deep
sense in which mass either changes or has directional
dependence has emerged. They put familiar relation-
ships to use in keeping track of non-classical behaviors
(item A above), but do not (item B above) provide frame-
invariant insights or make other relationships simpler as
well. As a result, majority acceptance of their use seems
further away now than it did a several decades ago3.

A more subtle trend in the pedagogical literature has
been toward the deﬁnition of a quantity called proper
velocity4,5, which can be written as −→w ≡ γ−→v . We use the
symbol w here because it is not in common use elsewhere
in relativity texts, and because w looks like γv from a
distance. This quantity also lets us cast the momentum

expression above in classical form as a mass times a ve-
locity, ie. as −→p = m−→w . Hence it serves at least one of
the “type A” goals served by m′ above.

We show here that, when introduced as part of a non-
coordinate time/velocity pair in pre-transform special
relativity, proper velocity allows us to introduce relativis-
tic momentum, time-dilation, and frame-invariant rela-
tivistic acceleration in context of a single inertial frame.
Moreover, through use of proper velocity many relation-
ships (including post-transform relationships like velocity
addition which require consideration of multiple frames)
are made simpler and sometimes more useful. Hence it
appears to serve goals of “type B” mentioned above as
well.

II. ONE OBJECT, ONE FRAME, BUT TWO
TIMES: THE CONSEQUENCES.

One may argue that a fundamental break between clas-
sical and relativistic kinematics involves the observation
that time passes diﬀerently for moving observers, than it
does for stationary ones. To quantify this, we deﬁne two
time variables when describing the motion of a single ob-
ject (traveler) with respect to a single inertial coordinate
frame. These are the coordinate time t and the proper
(or traveler) time to. Note that the proper time may be
diﬀerent for diﬀerent travelers.

It follows from above that we might also consider two
velocities, namely coordinate velocity −→v ≡ d−→x /dt, and
proper (or traveler-kinematic) velocity −→w ≡ d−→x /dto. It
is helpful to distinguish the units used to measure these
velocities, by saying that the ﬁrst measures distance trav-
eled per unit coordinate time, while the latter measures
distance traveled per unit traveler time. Convenient units
are [lightyears per coordinate year] and [lightyears per
traveler year], respectively. Each of these velocities can
be calculated from the other by knowing the velocity-
dependence of the “traveler’s speed of time” dt/dto, via
the equation

−→w = γ−→v

(1)

Note that all displacements dx are deﬁned with respect
to a single inertial (unprimed) frame. Thus proper ve-
locity is not simply a coordinate velocity measured with
respect to a diﬀerent frame. It is rather one of an inﬁnite
number of non-coordinate velocities, deﬁnable in context
of time/velocity pairs experienced by one of the inﬁnite

1

number of observers who may choose to track the mo-
tion of our given object on a given map using their own
clock6. The cardinal rule here is: measure all displace-
ments from the vantage point of the chosen inertial (or
“map”) frame. Thus proper velocity −→w is simply the rate
at which the coordinates of the traveler change per unit
traveler time on a map of the universe (e.g. in the trav-
eler’s “glove compartment”) which was drawn from the
point of view of the chosen inertial reference frame, and
not from the point of view of whatever inertial frame the
traveler happens to be in at a given time.

A number of useful relationships for this “traveler’s
speed of time”, including the familiar relationship to co-
ordinate velocity, follow simply from the (3+1)D nature
of the ﬂat spacetime metric (speciﬁcally from the frame-
invariant dot-product rule applied to the displacement
and velocity 4-vectors). Their derivation therefrom is
outlined in the Appendix. For introductory students,
we can simply quote Einstein’s prediction that space-
time is tied together so that instead of γ = 1, one has
1 − (v/c)2 = E/mc2, where E is Einstein’s “rel-
γ = 1/
ativistic energy” and c is the speed of light. It then fol-
lows from above that:

Here of course K is the kinetic energy of motion, equal
classically to 1
2 mv2. One of the simplest exercises a
student might do at this point is to show that since
1 + (w/c)2, as proper velocity w goes
v = w/γ = w/
to inﬁnity, the coordinate velocity v never gets larger
than c! All of classical kinematics also follows from these
things if and only if γ ≃ 1, which as one can see above is
true only for speeds v ≪ c.

p

Given these tools to describe the motion of an object
with respect to single inertial reference frame, perhaps
the easiest type of relativistic problem to solve is that of
time dilation. From the very deﬁnition of γ as a “trav-
eler’s speed of time”, and the velocity relations which
show that γ ≥ 1, it is easy to see that the traveler’s clock
will always run slower than coordinate time. Hence if
the traveler is going at a constant speed, one has from
equation 2 that traveler time is dilated (spread out over
a larger interval) relative to coordinate time, by the re-
lation

∆t = γ∆to ≥ ∆to

(3)

In this way time-dilation problems can be addressed,
without ﬁrst introducing the deeper complications (like
frame-dependent simultaneity) associated with multiple
inertial frames. This is the ﬁrst of several skills that this
strategy can oﬀer to students taking only introductory
physics, a “type A” beneﬁt according to the introduction.
A practical awareness of the non-global nature of time

thus need not require a readiness for the abstraction of
Lorentz transforms.

Equations 2 above also allow one to relate these veloc-
ities to energy. Hence an important part of relativistic
dynamics is in hand as well. Another important part of
relativistic dynamics, as mentioned in the introduction,
takes on a familiar form since momentum at any speed
is

−→p = m−→w = mγ−→v

(4)

This relation has important scientiﬁc consequences as
well. It shows that momentum like proper velocity has
no upper limit, and that coordinate velocity becomes ir-
relevant to tracking momentum at high speeds.

One might already imagine that proper speed w is
the important speed to a relativistic traveler trying to
get somewhere with minimum traveler time. Equation 4
shows that it is also a more interesting speed from the
point of view of law enforcement oﬃcials wishing to min-
imize fatalities on a highway in which relativistic speeds
are an option. This a “type B” beneﬁt of proper veloc-
ity.
In this context, it is not surprising that the press
doesn’t report “land speed record” for the fastest accel-
erated particle. New progress only changes the value of v
in the 7th or 8th decimal place. The story of increasing
proper velocity, in the meantime, goes untold to a pub-
lic whose imagination might be captured thereby. Af-
ter all, the educated lay public (comprised of those who
have had only one physics course) is by and large under
the impression that the lightspeed limit rules out major
progress along these lines.

III. THE FRAME-INVARIANT ACCELERATION
3-VECTOR.

The foregoing relations introduce, in context of a sin-
gle inertial frame and without Lorentz transforms, many
of the kinematical and dynamical relations of special rel-
ativity taught in introductory courses, in modern physics
courses, and perhaps even in some relativity courses. In
this section, we cover less familiar territory, namely the
equations of relativistic acceleration. Forces if deﬁned
simply as rates of momentum change in special rela-
tivity have no frame-invariant formulation, and hence
Newton’s 2nd Law retains it’s elegance only if written
in coordinate-independent 4-vector form. It is less com-
monly taught, however, that a frame-invariant 3-vector
acceleration can be deﬁned (again also in context of a
single inertial frame). We show that, in terms of proper
velocity and proper time, this acceleration has three sim-
ple integrals when held constant. Moreover, it bears a fa-
miliar relationship to the special frame-independent rate
of momentum change felt by an accelerated traveler.

By again examining the frame-invariant scalar prod-
uct of a 4-vector (this time of the acceleration 4-vector),
one can show (as we do in the Appendix) that a “proper

2

acceleration” for a given object, which is the same to
all inertial observers and thus “frame-invariant”, can be
written in terms of components for the classical acceler-
ation vector (i.e. the second coordinate-time t derivative
of displacement −→x ) by:

−→α =

−→a , where −→a ≡

(5)

γ3
γ⊥

d2−→x
dt2 .

This is quite remarkable, given that −→a is so strongly
frame-dependent! Here the “transverse time-speed“ γ⊥
1 − (v⊥/c)2, where v⊥ is the component
is deﬁned as 1/
of coordinate velocity −→v perpendicular to the direction
of coordinate accceleration −→a . In this section generally,
in fact, subscripts k and ⊥ refer to parallel and perpen-
dicular component directions relative to the direction of
this frame-invariant acceleration 3-vector −→α , and not (for
example) relative to coordinate velocity −→v .

p

Before considering integrals of the motion for constant
proper acceleration −→α , let’s review the classical integrals
of motion for constant acceleration −→a . These can be
written as a = ∆vk/∆t = 1
2 ∆(v2)/∆xk. The ﬁrst of
these is associated with conservation of momentum in the
absence of acceleration, and the second with the work-
energy theorem. These may look more familiar in the
form vkf = vki + a∆t, and v2
ki + 2a∆xk. Given that
coordinate velocity has an upper limit at the speed of
light, it is easy to imagine why holding coordinate accel-
eration constant in relativistic situations requires forces
which change even from the traveler’s point of view, and
is not possible at all for ∆t > (c − vki)/a.

kf = v2

Provided that proper time to, proper velocity w, and
time-speed γ can be used as variables, three simple inte-
grals of the proper acceleration can be obtained by a pro-
cedure which works for integrating other non-coordinate
velocity/time expressions as well6. The resulting inte-
grals are summarized in compact form, like those above,
as

tangent to a linear γ for large arguments. The equations
underlying this plot, from 6 for γ⊥ = 1 and coordinates
sharing a common origin, can be written simply as:

This universal acceleration plot, adapted to the relevant

of, and possibly to graphically solve, any constant ac-
celeration problem. Similar plots can be constructed for
more complicated trips (e.g. accelerated twin-paradox
adventures) and for the (3+1)D case as well6.

Here the integral with respect to proper time to has been
simpliﬁed by further deﬁning the hyperbolic velocity an-
gle or rapidity7 ηk ≡ sinh−1
[vk/c]. Note
that both v⊥ and the “transverse time-speed” γ⊥ are con-
stants, and hence both proper velocity, and longitudinal
momentum pk ≡ mwk, change at a uniform rate when
proper acceleration is held constant. If motion is only in
the direction of acceleration, γ⊥ is 1, and ∆p/∆t = mα
in the classical tradition.

In order to visualize the relationships deﬁned by equa-
tion 6, it is helpful to plot for the (1+1)D or γ⊥ = 1 case
all velocities and times versus x in dimensionless form
from a common origin on a single graph (i.e. as v/c,
αto/c, w/c = αt/c, and γ versus αx/c2). As shown in
Fig. 1, v/c is asymptotic to 1, αto/c is exponential for
large arguments, w/c = αt/c are hyperbolic, and also

In classical kinematics, the rate at which traveler en-
ergy E increases with time is frame-dependent, but the
rate at which momentum p increases is invariant. In spe-
cial relativity, these rates (when ﬁgured with respect to
proper time) relate to each other as time and space com-
ponents, respectively, of the acceleration 4-vector. Both
are frame-dependent at high speed. However, we can de-
ﬁne proper force separately as the force felt by an ac-
celerated object. We show in the Appendix that this is
−→
Fo ≡ m−→α . That is, all accelerated objects feel a
simply
−→
frame-invariant 3-vector force
Fo in the direction of their
acceleration. The magnitude of this force can be calcu-
lated from any inertial frame, by multiplying the rate
of momentum change in the acceleration direction times
γ⊥, or by multiplying mass times the proper accelera-
tion α. The classical relation F = dp/dt = mdv/dt =
md2x/dt2 = ma then becomes:

(8)

Even though the rate of momentum change joins the rate
of energy change in becoming frame-dependent at high
speed, Newton’s 2nd Law for 3-vectors thus retains a
frame-invariant form.

Although they depend on the observer’s inertial frame,
it is instructive to write out the components of momen-
tum and energy rate-of-change in terms of proper force
magnitude Fo. The classical equation relating rates of
−→
momentum change to force is d−→p /dt =

Note that if there are non-zero components of velocity in
directions both parallel and perpendicular to the direction
of acceleration, then momentum changes are seen to have
a component perpendicular to the acceleration direction,
as well as parallel to it. These transverse momentum
changes result because transverse proper velocity w⊥ =
γv⊥ (and hence momentum p⊥) changes when traveler γ
changes, even though v⊥ is staying constant.

As mentioned above, the rate at which traveler energy
increases with time classically depends on traveler ve-
locity through the relation dE/dt = F vk = m(−→a • −→v ).
Relativistically, this becomes

γ⊥

dE

= Fowk = m (−→α • −→w ) .

(10)

Hence the rate of traveler energy increase is in form very
similar to that in the classical case.

Similarly, the classical relationship between work,
force, and impulse can be summarized with the relation
dE/dxk = F = dpk/dt. Relativistically, this becomes

1
γ⊥

.

(11)

Once again, save for some changes in scaling associated
with the “transverse time-speed” constant γ⊥, the form
of the classical relationship between work, force, and im-
pulse is preserved in the relativistic case. Since these
simple connections are a result, and not the reason, for
our introduction of proper time/velocity in context of a
single inertial frame, we suspect that they provide insight
into relations that are true both classically and relativis-
tically, and thus are beneﬁts of “type B” discussed in the
introduction.

IV. PROPER-VELOCITY EQUATIONS IN
“POST-TRANSFORM” RELATIVITY.

The foregoing treats calculations made possible, and
analogies with classical forms which result,
if one in-
troduces the proper time/velocity variables in context
of a single inertial frame, prior to discussion of multi-
ple inertial frames and hence prior to the introduction
of Lorentz transforms. Are the Lorentz transform, and
other post-transform relations, similarly simpliﬁed or ex-
tended? The answer is yes, although our insights in this
area are limited by the facts that: (i) we have taken only
a cursory look at post-transform material, and (ii) one
key expansion area, the treatment of acceleration, is al-
ready taken care of by the pre-transform material above.
The Lorentz transform itself is simpliﬁed, in that it can
be written using proper velocity in the symmetric matrix
form:

(12)

This seems to us an improvement over the asymmetric
equations normally used, but of course requires a bit of
matrix and 4-vector notation that your students may not
be ready to exploit.

The expression for length contraction, namely L =
Lo/γ, is not changed at all. The developments above
do suggest that the concept of proper length Lo,
as the length of a yardstick in the frame in which
it is at rest, may have broader use as well. The
relativistic Doppler eﬀect expression, given as f =
fo
{1 + (v/c)}/{1 − (v/c)} in terms of coordinate ve-
locity, also simpliﬁes to f = fo/{γ − (w/c)}.

p
The most noticeable eﬀect of proper velocity, in the
post-transform relativity we’ve considered so far, involves
simpliﬁcation and symmetrization of the velocity addi-
tion rule. The rule for adding coordinate velocities −→v ′
and −→v to get relative coordinate velocity −→v ′′, namely
k = (v′ + vk)/(1 + vkv′/c2) and v′′
v′′
⊥ 6= v⊥ with subscripts
referring to component orientation with respect to the
direction of −→v ′, is inherently complicated. Moreover, for
high speed calculations, the answer is usually uninter-
esting since large coordinate velocities always add up to
something very near to c. By comparison, if one adds
proper velocities −→w ′ = γ′−→v ′ and −→w = γ−→v to get relative
proper velocity −→w ′′, one ﬁnds simply that the coordinate
velocity factors add while the γ-factors multiply, i.e.

w′′

k = γ′γ

v′ + vk

,with w′

⊥ = w⊥.

(13)

Note that the components transverse to the direction of
(cid:0)
−→v ′ are unchanged.

(cid:1)

Physically more interesting questions can be answered
with equation 13 than with the coordinate velocity ad-
dition rule. For example, one might ask what rela-
tive proper velocity (and hence momentum) is attain-
able with colliding beams from an accelerator able to

4

produce particles of proper speed w for impact onto a
stationary target.
If one is using 50GeV electrons in
the LEP2 accelerator at CERN, γ and γ′ are E/mc2 ≃
50GeV /511keV ≃ 105, v and v′ are essentially c, and
w and w′ are hence 105c. Upon collision, equation 13
tells us that in a collider the relative proper speed w′′ is
(105)2(c + c) = 2 × 1010c. Investment in a collider thus
buys a factor of 2γ = 2 × 105 increase in the momen-
tum (and energy) of collision. Compared to the cost of
building a 10P eV accelerator for the equivalent eﬀect on
a stationary target, the collider is a bargain indeed!

V. CONCLUSIONS.

We show in this paper that introduction of two vari-
ables in the context of a single inertial frame, speciﬁ-
cally the non-coordinate proper (or traveler-kinematic)
time/velocity pair, lets students tackle time dilation and
relativistic acceleration problems, prior to consideration
of issues involving multiple inertial frames (like Lorentz
transforms, length contraction, and frame-dependent si-
multaneity). The cardinal rule to follow when doing this
is simple: All distances must be deﬁned with respect to
“maps” drawn from the vantage point of a single inertial
reference frame.

We show further that a frame-invariant proper accel-
eration 3-vector has three simple integrals of the motion,
in terms of these variables. Hence students can speak
of the proper acceleration and force 3-vectors for an ob-
ject in frame-independent terms, and solve relativistic
constant acceleration problems much as they now do for
non-relativistic problems in introductory courses.

We further show that the use of these variables does
more than “superﬁcially preserve classical forms”. Not
only are more than one classical equation preserved with
minor change with these variables.
In addition, more
interesting physics is accessible to students more quickly
with the equations that result. The relativistic addition
rule for proper velocities is a special case of the latter in
point. Hence we argue that the trend in the pedagogical
literature, away from relativistic masses and toward use
of proper time and velocity in combination, may be a
robust one which provides: (B) deeper insight, as well as
(A) more value from lessons ﬁrst-taught.

APPENDIX A: THE 4-VECTOR PERSPECTIVE

This appendix provides a more elegant view of mat-
ters discussed in the body of this paper by using space-
time 4-vectors not used there, along with some promised
derivations. We postulate ﬁrst that: (i) displacements
between events in space and time may be described by a
displacement 4-vector X for which the time–component
may be put into distance-units by multiplying by the
speed of light c; (ii) subtracting the sum of squares of
space-related components of any 4-vector from the time
component squared yields a scalar “dot-product” which is
frame-invariant, i.e. which has a value which is the same
for all inertial observers; and (iii) translational momen-
tum and energy, two physical quantities which are con-
served in the absence of external intervention, are compo-
nents of the momentum-energy 4-vector P ≡m dX
, where
dto
m is the object’s rest mass and to is the frame-invariant
displacement in time-units along its trajectory.

From above, the 4-vector displacement between two
events in space-time is described in terms of the position
and time coordinate values for those two events, and can
be written as:

∆X ≡ 

c∆t
∆x
∆y



(A1)

Here the usual ∆-notation is used to represent the value
of ﬁnal minus initial. The dot-product of the displace-
ment 4-vector is deﬁned as the square of the frame-
invariant proper-time interval between those two events.
In other words,

(A2)

Since this dot-product can be positive or negative, proper
time intervals can be real (time-like) or imaginary (space-
like). It is easy to rearrange this equation for the case
when the displacement is inﬁnitesimal, to conﬁrm the
ﬁrst two equalities in equation 2 via:

If we deﬁne kinetic energy as the diﬀerence between rest
mass-energy and total energy using K ≡ E − mc2, then
the last equality in equation 2 follows as well. Another
useful relation which follows is the relation between in-
ﬁnitesimal uncertainties, namely dE

dp = dx
dt .

Lastly, the force-power 4-vector may be deﬁned as the
proper time derivative of the momentum-energy 4-vector,
i.e.:

Here we’ve taken the liberty to deﬁne acceleration 4-
vector A ≡ d2X/dt2

o as well.

The dot-product of the force-power 4-vector is always
negative. It may therefore be used to deﬁne the frame-
invariant proper acceleration α, by writing:

Abstract

We show how the pre-exponential factor of the Feynman propagator for the harmonic

oscillator can be computed by the generalized ζ-function method. Besides, we establish a

direct equivalence between this method and Schwinger’s propertime method.

In a recent paper that appeared in this journal [1] the harmonic oscillator propagator was

evaluated by a variety of ways, all of them based on path integrals. In fact, some of them did

not involve any explicit computation of the Feynman path integral, but their common starting

point was actually an expression for the harmonic oscillator propagator which was explicitly

derived by path integral means, namely (we are using as much as possible the notation of

reference [1]):

and the determinants must be computed with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the previous

equation S[zcl] means the classical action, that is, the functional action evaluated at the classical

solution satisfying the Feynman conditions z(ti) = zi and z(tf ) = zf and the factor before the

exponential is the so called pre-exponential factor, which we shall denote by F (tf −

care must be taken here since both products are inﬁnite, but their ratio is ﬁnite); (ii) it was

computed with the aid of Schwinger’s propertime method [2] (an introductory presentation of

this method with simple applications can be found in reference [3]); (iii) it was computed by

the Green function approach (a variety of simple examples worked out with this approach can

be found in references [4, 5]).

In this note we just add to the previous list one more method for computing the pre-

exponential factor of the harmonic oscillator propagator, namely, the generalized ζ function

2

method, so that this note can be considered as a small complement of Holstein’s paper [1].

In fact, every time we make a semiclassical approximation, no matter it is in the context of

quantum mechanics or quantum ﬁeld theory, we will get involved with the computation of

a determinant of a diﬀerential operator with some boundary conditions.

If we try naively

to compute these determinants as the products of the corresponding eigenvalues we will get

ill deﬁned expressions. Hence, it is imperative to give a ﬁnite prescription for computing

determinants for these cases. The generalized ζ-function method is precisely one possible way

of doing that. It was introduced in physics in the middle seventies [6] and it is in fact a very

powerful regularization prescription which has applications in several branches of physics (a

detailed discussion can be found in reference [7]). This method, as we will see, is based on an

analytical extension in the complex plane. We think that the harmonic oscillator propagator is

the perfect scenario for introducing such an important method, because undergraduate students

are all familiarized with the quantum harmonic oscillators and besides, it is the ﬁrst non-trivial

example after the free particle. In what follows, we shall ﬁrst introduce brieﬂy the ζ-function

method, then we shall apply it to compute F (tf −
ﬁnally, we shall establish a direct equivalence between this method and Schwinger’s propertime

ti) for the harmonic oscillator propagator and

method.

Consider an operator A and let us assume, without loss of generality, that it has a discrete

set of non-degenerate eigenvalues

ζ(s; A) = T r A−s .

(5)

where we deﬁned the generalized zeta function associated to the operator A as

However, when there is an inﬁnite number of eigenvalues (and these are the cases of interest

in physics), as it occurs when A is a diﬀerential operator, the product of the eigenvalues will

be an ill deﬁned quantity and will not serve anymore as a good prescription for det A. In other

words, expression (3) with ζ(s; A) given by (4), as it stands, is meaningless because it is not

valid anymore to use that:

∂λ−s
n
∂s !s=0

Hence, we need for these cases to deﬁne a ﬁnite prescription for detA. The generalized zeta

function prescription consists basically of the following three steps: (i) we ﬁrst compute the

eigenvalues of A subjected to the appropriate boundary conditions and then write down the

corresponding ζ-function ζ(s; A) = T r A−s =

n λ−s

n ; (ii) Since the last sum does not converge

P
at s = 0, we make an analytical extension of this function to the whole complex plane of s (or

at least to a domain that contains the origin); (iii) after the analytical extension is made, we

just write det A = exp

ζ ′(s = 0; A)

In order to apply the ζ-function method described above in the computation of F (tf −

ti)

we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd the eigenvalues of

This analytical extension guarantees that all the eigenvalues (now of the operator

positive. Of course, after the calculations are ﬁnished we must undo this transformation, that

is, we must substitute τ = i(tf −

be done with no eﬀort at all, for this series is precisely the so called non-homogeneous Epstein

function, which we shall denote simply by E1(s; ν2) and whose analytical extension to the whole

However, last expression is not analytic at s = 0 (though the presence of the exponential

it is not valid to take the s derivative at s = 0. In order to circumvent this problem, we make

Last expression corresponds precisely to Schwinger’s formula written in a regularized way. Here

we regularized by introducing positive powers of τ , but other regularization schemes can also

be used, as for example the one used by Schwinger [10] in the computation of the Casimir eﬀect

[11] (for a simple introduction to this eﬀect with some historical remarks see reference [12]). It

is common to write the above expression formally with α = 0, but in fact, before taking this

limit one should get rid oﬀ all spurious terms (those with no physical meaning).

In this note we have presented the generalized ζ-function method for computing determi-

nants in a very introductory level. A detailed discussion with a great variety of examples can

be found in reference [7]. One of the greatest advantadges of this method is that for almost all

diﬀerential operators and boundary conditions that are relevant in physics, the corresponding

generalized ζ-function (after the analytical extension is made) is a meromorphic function in the

whole complex plane which is analytic at the origin. Furthermore, this method can also be ap-

plied successfully in many other branches of physics, as for example, statistical mechanics and

8

quantum ﬁeld theory among others. Of course there are many easier ways of obtaining F (tf −
for the harmonic oscillator, but our purpose here was to introduce a new method, which is a

ti)

powerful one and widely used nowadays. In this sense, we think that the harmonic oscillator

provided a perfect scenario for the understanding of the three basic steps of the method, since

every undergraduate student is somehow familiarized with the harmonic oscillator.

Appendix

In this appendix we shall obtain the analytical extension of the Epstein function Eν2

1 (s; 1),

given in the text by equation (9). With this goal, we ﬁrst write down an equation involving

the Gamma function, which follows directly from its deﬁnition, namely [9]:

Γ(z)A−z =

dτ τ z−1 e−Aτ

, Re(z) > 0

(22)

∞

Z

Using the previous equation with A = n2 + ν2, the Epstein function can be written in the form:

Eν2

Using (22), the ﬁrst and second integrals of the right hand side of the above equation can

be written directly in term of Euler Gamma functions. For the last term, we use the integral

representation for the modiﬁed Bessel function of second kind:

which is precisely equation (9). Some comments are in order here: (i) to say that the previous

equation corresponds to the analytical extension of Eν2

(s; 1) to a meromorphic function in the

whole complex plane means that this expression is an analytical function in the whole complex

plane except by an enumerable number of poles (which can be inﬁnite) and coincides with the

original sum in the region where the sum was deﬁned; (ii) it is worth emphasizing that the

above expression is analytic at the origin; in fact, the structure of simple poles of this function

is dictated by the poles of the Euler gamma function. It is easy to see that the poles are located

at s = 1/2,

1/2,

3/2,

5/2. etc..

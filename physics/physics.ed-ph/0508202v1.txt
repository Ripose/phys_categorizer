Abstract

We show how the induction law is correctly used in the path integral computation of
the free particle propagator. The way this primary path integral example is treated in
most textbooks is a little bit missleading.

The path integral quantization method was developed in detail by Feynman [1] in 1948.
Feynman developed some earlier ideas introduced by Dirac [2]. Since then, path integral meth-
ods have provided a good alternative procedure to quantization and many books have been
written on this subject, not only in quantum mechanics [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], but also in quantum
ﬁeld theory [8, 9, 10] (many modern textbooks in quantum ﬁeld theory devote a few chapters
to functional methods). We can surely say that in the last decades, Feynman’s method has
been recognized as a very convenient and economic mathematical tool for treating problems in
a great variety of areas in physics, from ordinary quantum mechanics and statistical quantum
mechanics to quantum ﬁeld theory and condensed matter ﬁeld. It is a common feature of almost
all texts which introduce the Feynman quantization prescription to use the unidimensional free
particle propagator as a ﬁrst example. In many cases, this simple example is the only one that
is explicitly evaluated. The reason for that is simple: after the free particle propagator has
been presented, it is usual to introduce the semiclassical method, which is exact for quadratic
lagrangians, so that examples like the oscillator propagator or the propagator for a charged
particle in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld can be obtained without the explicit calculation of the
Feynman path integral (for the oscillator propagator, the reader may ﬁnd both calculations,
that is, the explicit one and the semiclassical one in Ref.[11]; see also references therein). Curi-
ous as it may seem, the free particle propagator is not treated as it should, regarding the correct
use of the mathematical induction law. It is the purpose of this note to show how the induction
law shold be applied to the free particle propagator in the context of path integrals. In what
follows, we ﬁrst make some comments about the usual way of obtaining this propagator and
then we show how one should proceed if the use of induction law is taken seriously.

The Feynman prescription for the quantum mechanical transition amplitude K(xN , x0; τ )
of a particle which was localized at x0 at time t = 0, to be at the position xN at time t = τ
(called Feynman propagator) is given by the path integral [3]:

K(xN , x0; τ ) = limN→∞

where V (x) is the potential energy of the particle. Setting V (x) = 0 in the above equation, we
get the free particle Feynman propagator:

where j = 1, 2, ..., N
1, so that I1 corresponds to the result of the ﬁrst integration (with
two normalization factors taken into account), I2 corresponds to the result of the ﬁrst two
integrations (with three normalization factors taken into account), etc.. As a consequence of
the previous deﬁnition, we can write:

and it is also clear that:

K(xN , x0; τ ) = lim

What is usually done in the literature is the following: one ﬁrstly obtains the expression
for I1, which can be done by completing the square in the argument of the exponential of the
integrand, that is,

IN −1(x0, xN ) .

where we have used the Fresnel integral [12]. Next, using Eq.(4) and the above result for
I1(x0, x2), one proceeds and obtains the expression for I2:

It is common to accept that Eqs.(6) and (7) are suﬃcient to demonstrate Eq.(8), so that the
ﬁnal expressions for the desired propagator is given by:

which is, in fact, the correct answer.

However, a “strongly suggested result” is not enough to be considered as a mathematical

demonstration of a result. A rigorous demonstration of Eq.(8) for j = 1, 2, ..., N
the correct use of the mathematical induction law, which we pass now to discuss.

To apply correctly the induction law to the problem at hand means the following: we ﬁrst
demonstrate the validity of Eq.(8) for j = 1 and then we demonstrate that if this equation is
true for an arbitrary j, it will also be true for j + 1. The ﬁrst step is already done, see Eq.(6).
To complete the demonstration, let us assume that Eq.(8) is valid for an arbitrary j. Therefore,
using Eq.(4) the expression for Ij+1 is given by:

Ij+1(x0, xj+2) =

which is precisely Eq.(8) if we replace in this equation j by j + 1. Hence, we have succeeded
in demonstrating that the validity of this equation for an arbitrary j implies indeed its validity
for j + 1 and as a consequence, Eq.(9) is now rigorously justiﬁed. Though this is the simplest
quantum propagator, it is in general the ﬁrst example presented by most texts in path integral
quantization and we think that if it is done with a reasonable mathematical rigor it is a good
beginning for those who intend to step into the path integral world.

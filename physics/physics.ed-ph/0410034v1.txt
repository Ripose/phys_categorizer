Abstract

A classical problem of mechanics involves a projectile ﬁred from a given point with
a given velocity whose direction is varied. This results in a family of trajectories whose
envelope deﬁnes the border of a “safe” domain. In the simple cases of a constant
force, harmonic potential, and Kepler or Coulomb motion, the trajectories are conic
curves whose envelope in a plane is another conic section which can be derived either
by simple calculus or by geometrical considerations. The case of harmonic forces
reveals a subtle property of the maximal sum of distances within an ellipse.

1 Introduction

A classical problem of classroom mechanics and military academies is the border of the
so-called safe domain. A projectile is set oﬀ from a point O with an initial velocity v0
whose modulus is ﬁxed by the intrinsic properties of the gun, while its direction can be
varied arbitrarily. Its is well-known that, in absence of air friction, each trajectory is a
parabola, and that, in any vertical plane containing O, the envelope of all trajectories is
another parabola, which separates the points which can be shot from those which are out
of reach. This will be shortly reviewed in Sec. 2. Amazingly, the problem of this envelope
parabola can be addressed, and solved, in terms of elementary geometrical properties.

In elementary mechanics, there are similar problems, that can be solved explicitly and
lead to families of conic trajectories whose envelope is also a conic section. Examples are
the motion in a Kepler or Coulomb ﬁeld, or in an harmonic potential. This will be the
subject of Secs. 3 and 4.

It is intriguing, that the property of ellipses unveiled by the case of the harmonic
potential is not very well known (following an e-mail survey around some mathematician
colleagues), and is not easily proved by simple geometrical reasoning. It turns out, actually,
that the mechanics problem provides one of the simplest sets of equations leading to the
desired proof.

1

This contrasts with the problem of Kepler ellipses. Here, the purely geometrical proof
is astonishingly simple, and overcomes in eﬃciency and elegance the proof that can be
written down by elementary calculus.
It is hoped that students will be encouraged to
carry out the solution to these problems from both a geometrical view point and a sober
handling of the basic equations.

Kepler motion and other classical problems of elementary mechanics have been treated
very elegantly in several textbooks and articles, a fraction of which insist convincingly on
the geometrical aspects. It is impossible to quote here all relevant pieces of the literature.
Some recent articles [1] allow one to trace back many previous contributions.

In particular, the problem of the safe domain in a constant ﬁeld is well treated in
Ref. [2], where the point of view of successive trajectories of varied initial angle and the
point of view of simultaneous ﬁring in all directions are both considered. The case of
Coulomb or Kepler motion is treated in some detail by French [3], with references to
earlier work by Macklin, who used geometric methods. The case of Rutherford scattering
starting from inﬁnite distance can be found, e.g., in a paper by Warner and Huttar [4], and
in Ref. [3], while the case of ﬁnite initial distance is discussed in a paper by Samengo and
Barrachina [6]. Hence, we shall include in our discussion the cases of constant force and
inverse squared-distance force only for the sake of completeness. The envelope of ellipses
in a harmonic potential is also treated in Ref. [3], but with standard envelope calculus.
The geometric approach presented here is new, at least to our knowledge.

2 Constant force

Let us assume a constant force f whose direction is chosen as the vertical axis. This can be
realized as the gravitational ﬁeld in ballistics, or an electric ﬁeld acting on non-relativistic
charged particles. It is suﬃcient to consider a meridian plane Oxz. If α denotes the angle
of the initial velocity v0 with respect to the x axis, then the motion of a projectile ﬁred
from the origin O is

x = v0t cos α ,

y = v0t sin α +

f t2
2m

.

2.1 A family of parabolas
Eliminating the time, t, in Eq. (1), and introducing the natural length scale a = v2
the problem leads to the well-known parabola

0m/f of

y =

+ x tan α .

Examples are shown in Fig. 1. Each trajectory is drawn for both positive and negative
times, t = 0 corresponding to the time of ﬁring from O. This is equivalent to putting
together the trajectories corresponding to angles α and α + π.

Equation (2) can now be seen from a diﬀerent view point: given a point M of coordinates
x and y, is there any possibility to reach it with the gun? The answer is known: nearby

points, or points located downstream of the ﬁeld can be reached twice, by a straight shot
or a bell-like trajectory. Points located far away, or too much upstream are, however, out
of reach. The limit is the parabola

2.2 Geometric solution

The parabolas (2) have in common a point O, and their directrix, ∆, which is located at
y =

a/2. The equation can, indeed, be read as

revealing the focus F located at (xF , yF ), i.e., on a circle, with centre at O, of radius a/2,
at an angle β = 2α

π/2 with the horizontal.

The geometric construction follows, as shown in Fig. 2. A current point M of a trajec-
tory fulﬁlls MF = MH, with the notation of the ﬁgure. If ∆′ is parallel to the common
directrix ∆, at a distance a/2 further up, then the distance MK to ∆′ and the distance
MO to the origin obey

O and directrix ∆′. The equality is satisﬁed when M, F and O are aligned. From β =

π/2, a result pointed out by Macklin [5] is recovered, that the tangent to the envelope
is perpendicular to the initial velocity of the trajectory that is touched. (If M is on the
envelope, MO = MK and the tangent is the inner bisector of \OMK.)

2.3 A family of circles

A more peaceful view at the safe domain is that of an ideal ﬁrework: projectiles of various
angle α are ﬁred all at once, with the same velocity [2]. At a given time t, they describe a
circle (a sphere in space)

x2 + (y

, i.e., falling freely, and a growing radius v0t. The problem
with the centre at
of safety now consists of examining whether Eq. (6) has any solution in t for given x and
y. This is a mere second-order equation, whose vanishing discriminant leads back to the
parabola (3). Figure 3 show a few circles whose envelope is this parabola.

A few trajectories are shown in Fig. 4, together with their envelope, which is an ellipse
with foci, O, the centre of force, and A, the common starting point. The envelope is easily
derived by elementary calculus. Equation (8), for a given point characterized by u and θ,
should have acceptable solutions in α. This is a mere second order equation in cot α, and
the vanishing of its discriminant gives the border of the safe domain.

A geometric derivation of the envelope gives an answer even faster. All trajectories

3.2 Rutherford scattering

As a variant, consider now the case of a repulsive interaction, V = K/r, K > 0, as in
Rutherford’s historical experiment. The simplest case is that of particles sent from very
far away with the same velocity v0 but diﬀerent values of the impact parameter b, this
resulting in varying orbital momenta
. Examples are shown in Fig. 6. We have a family

corresponding to the outside of a parabola of focus O, also shown in Fig. 6.

The geometric interpretation is the following. All trajectories have the same energy
E = mv2
0/2, and hence the same axis 2a since E = K/(2a), very much analogous to
E =
/(2a) for ellipses in the case of attraction and negative energy. Each hyperbola
K
has a focus O, and second focus F on the line ∆, perpendicular to the initial asymptote at
distance 2a from O. The middle of OF lies on this asymptote, whose position is determined
by the impact parameter b. Let ∆′ be parallel to ∆, at a further distance 2a. If M is on a
trajectory, and is projected on ∆′ at K, then

3.3 Scattering from ﬁnite distance

A simple generalization consists of considering particles launched in the repulsive Coulomb
ﬁeld from a point A, at ﬁnite distance r0 from the centre of force O. The kinetic energy,
written as mv2
0/2 = K/(2a), ﬁxes the length scale a. The problem has been studied,
e.g., by Samengo and Barrachina [6], who discussed glory- and rainbow-like eﬀects. Some
trajectories and their envelope and shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen, and proved that

For r0 > 2a, the envelope is a branch of hyperbola with O as the inner focus. In the
limit r0
, we obtain the parabola of ordinary Rutherford scattering.
For r0 = 2a, the envelope is simply the mediatrix of OA.
For r0 < 2a, the envelope is a branch of hyperbola with O as the external focus.

This central-force problem is more easily solved directly in Cartesian coordinates, in

mandatory. One obtains

4.2 Firing all projectiles simultaneously

The “ﬁreball” view point leads to similar equations. If all projectiles are ﬁred all at once,
they describe, in a plane, at time t, the circle

again, a second-order polynomial, now in cos(ωt), and from its discriminant, the equation
(15) of the envelope is recovered. Figure 10 shows the envelope surrounding the circles and
touching some of those.

4.3 Geometric construction

The geometric construction of this envelope can be carried out as follows. All trajectories
have again the same energy, E = k(x2
0)/2, since only the angle of the initial velocity
is varied. This means that all ellipses have same quadratic sum a2 + b2 of semi-major and
semi-minor axes. There exists, indeed, a basis, where, after shifting time, the motion reads
X = a cos(ωt), Y = b sin(ωt). If one recalculates the energy in this basis at t = 0, one
ﬁnds a potential term ka2/2 and a kinetic term mω2b2/2, and hence E = k(a2 + b2)/2.

corresponding, indeed, to an ellipse of foci A and A′.

A theorem is used here, that is not too well known, though it turns out (after several

described below.

conjugate axes of T .

The proof can be found in Ref. [8, p. 350]. It is linked to a consequence of the Poncelet

theorem formulated by Chasles.

Steps in understanding the above property include:

The maximum is reached twice, for say, M and M ′, AMA′M ′ forming a parallelo-
gram, as shown in Fig. 11.
By ﬁrst order variation, the tangent in M is a bissectrix of \AMA′.
The tangent in M is perpendicular to the tangent in A. This provides the non-trivial
result that if M maximizes MA + MA′, conversely, A (or A′) maximizes the sum of
distances to M and M ′.
The tangents in A, M, A′, and M ′ forming a rectangle, the Monge theorem [8, p. 332]
applies, stating that the orthoptic curve of the ellipse (set of points from which the
ellipse is seen at 90◦), is a circle of radius √a2 + b2, see Fig. 11.

orthogonal, and thus intersect on the orthoptic curve of the ellipse, which is a circle. The
sides of the parallelogram are tangent to a homofocal ellipse of semi-axes a2/√a2 + b2 and
b2/√a2 + b2.

Note that if one tries to demonstrate this theorem by straightforward calculus, one
generally writes down cumbersome equations. One of the simplest – if not the simplest –
methods, would consist of starting from the trajectories (13), identifying there the most
general set of ellipses of given a2 + b2, and calculating the envelope (15), which is easily
identiﬁed as an ellipse of foci A and A′ and major axis 2√a2 + b2. It thus follows that on
each trajectory, MA + MA′

5 Conclusions

Conic sections are encountered in classical optics, where they provide a design for ideal
mirrors with perfect refocusing properties of light rays emitted by a suitably-located point-

12

source.

Trajectories in elementary mechanics simple potentials such as a linear, Coulomb or
quadratic potential, also follow conic sections. When the angle of the initial velocity is
varied, one gets a family of trajectories with the same total energy. Their envelope sets
the limits of the safe domain. This envelope can be deduced by recollecting astute though
somewhat old-fashioned methods of geometry courses.

If the potential becomes more complicated or if one uses relativistic kinematics, the
envelope has to be derived by calculus, but the techniques can be probed ﬁrst on these
cases where a purely geometric solution is available.

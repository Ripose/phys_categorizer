Abstract

Many pedagogical introductions of inﬂation are eﬀective due to the simplicity
of the relevant equations. Here an analytic solution of the cosmological equa-
tions is presented and used as an example to discuss fundamental aspects of the
inﬂationary paradigm.

1 Introduction

The standard big bang cosmology1−4 is a very successful theory of the universe with
certain drawbacks. They include the horizon, ﬂatness and monopole problems5,6 or, in
short, the ability to explain the observed universe only when the initial conditions are
extremely ﬁne-tuned. Cosmic inﬂation solves the problems of big bang cosmology and
was introduced7 at the beginning of the 80’s. Today, almost 20 years later, inﬂation is
incorporated into modern cosmology and is a mature topic for inclusion in introductory
courses in gravitation and cosmology.

Inﬂation consists of a short period of accelerated superluminal expansion of the early
universe, at the end of which the description of the standard big bang model is applied.
During the inﬂationary epoch, the matter content of the universe has an equation of state
very close to that of the quantum vacuum, P = −ρ (where ρ and P are, respectively,
Inﬂation also provides a mechanism for
the energy density and pressure of matter).
the generation of density perturbations through quantum ﬂuctuations of the scalar ﬁeld
which is supposed to drive the cosmic expansion4,8−12.

Although the original scenario of inﬂation and many others proposed to date are
based on speciﬁc particle physics theories, the point of view of modern cosmology has
shifted: inﬂation is currently regarded as a paradigm, a general idea that can be imple-
mented in a variety of ways to describe the early universe. There are many inﬂationary
scenarios in the literature, but none is accepted as compelling and there is no “standard
model” of inﬂation.
In this phenomenological point of view it is possible to present
cosmological inﬂation in the classroom in an easy way, without previous knowledge of
advanced particle physics. The task is made feasible by the simplicity of the equations
of inﬂation, ordinary diﬀerential equations which are solved in the slow rollover approx-
imation, a simpliﬁcation used in most inﬂationary theories. Inﬂation is the subject of
numerous textbooks and introductory review papers4,8,10−13 as well as science popular-
ization articles and books14.

Important issues in understanding inﬂation are the slow rollover approximation, the
equivalence between a constant scalar ﬁeld potential and the cosmological constant, and
the correspondence between the equation of state and the scalar ﬁeld potential. This
paper discusses these aspects of inﬂation in detail, through the example of an exact
analytic solution of the dynamical equations. The latter is derived using elementary
calculus and is used to clarify the issues mentioned above, with the added virtue of
being useful for introducing the cosmic no-hair theorems.

2 The slow rollover approximation

In this section we recall the basics about the cosmological constant, inﬂation, and the
slow rollover approximation used for simplifying and solving the equations of inﬂation.
In general relativity a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe is described by
a metric of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker class1−4. For simplicity, we set
our discussion in such a universe with ﬂat spatial sections, described by the line element

ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)(cid:16)dx2 + dy2 + dz2(cid:17) ,

(2.1)

in comoving coordinates (t, x, y, z), where a(t) is the scale factor of the universe. For
this metric, the Einstein equations of general relativity reduce to15−17

where an overdot denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to the comoving time t and ρm
and Pm are, respectively, the energy density and pressure of the material content of the
universe, which is assumed to be a perfect ﬂuid. H ≡ ˙a/a is the Hubble parameter, Λ
is the cosmological constant, G is Newton’s constant and units are used in which the
speed of light in vacuum assumes the value unity.

As is clear from the inspection of Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3), it is possible to describe the
contribution of the cosmological constant as a ﬂuid with energy density and pressure
given by

ρΛ =

PΛ = −

respectively, and equation of state P = −ρ. Accordingly, one can rewrite Eqs. (2.2) and
(2.3) as

where ρ ≡ ρm + ρΛ and P ≡ Pm + PΛ.
Inﬂation is deﬁned as an epoch in the history of the universe during which the
cosmic expansion is accelerated, ¨a > 0. Eq. (2.5) shows that acceleration is equivalent

to a negative pressure satisfying P < −ρ/3. It turns out that an inﬂationary period
in which the universe expands by the factor e70 solves the ﬁne-tuning problems of the
standard big bang cosmology18.

In the original model and in most scenarios, inﬂation is obtained by assuming that
at an early time of the order of 10−34 seconds the energy density of the cosmological
ﬂuid was dominated by a scalar ﬁeld called inﬂaton. Scalar ﬁelds are ever present in
particle physics, and it is natural that they played a role when the universe had the size
of a subatomic particle. Inﬂation can then be seen as scalar ﬁeld dynamics; the energy
density and pressure of a scalar ﬁeld φ minimally coupled to gravity are given by19,20

(2.7)

(2.8)

where V (φ) and ( ˙φ)2/2 are, respectively, the potential and kinetic energy densities of the
scalar ﬁeld. The scalar φ only depends on the time coordinate, due to the assumption
of spatial homogeneity, and satisﬁes the well known Klein-Gordon equation2,4

¨φ + 3H ˙φ +

By inserting Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) into Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) one obtains

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

which, together with Eq. (2.9), constitute the equations of inﬂation. Note that only two
of the three equations (2.9), (2.10) and (2.11) are independent; when ˙φ 6= 0, Eq. (2.9)
follows from the energy conservation equation21

˙ρ + 3H (ρ + P ) = 0 .

(2.12)

Diﬀerent inﬂationary scenarios correspond to diﬀerent choices of the form of the scalar
ﬁeld potential V (φ), which are usually motivated by particle physics arguments. Certain
scenarios are set in theories of gravity alternative to general relativity22, and will not be
considered here.

3

From the didactical point of view, it is interesting that the dynamics of the inﬂaton
ﬁeld can be viewed as the motion of a ball with unit mass, position φ and speed ˙φ rolling
on a hill which has a proﬁle given by4 the shape of V (φ).

The equations of inﬂation are usually solved in the slow rollover approximation, which
assumes that the inﬂaton’s speed ˙φ is small, that V (φ) ≫ ˙φ2/2, and that the inﬂaton’s
motion (described by Eq. (2.9)) is friction-dominated. Then, the acceleration term ¨φ
can be neglected in comparison with the force term V ′ ≡ dV /dφ and with the friction
term 3H ˙φ in Eq. (2.9). A necessary condition for this to occur is that the inequalities

hold23. In other words, in the slow rollover approximation the slow roll parameters

,

(2.15)

(2.16)

are small, ǫ,|η| ≪ 1. ǫ and η are related, respectively, to the slope and the curvature of
the scalar ﬁeld potential V (φ); the smallness of ǫ and |η| means that the potential V (φ)
is relatively ﬂat during slow roll inﬂation. The equations of inﬂation reduce to the two
ﬁrst order equations

(2.18)

It would be misleading to put excessive emphasis on the requirement that ǫ and η be
small and on the existence of an almost ﬂat section of the potential V (φ) on which the
scalar ﬁeld φ can slowly roll (i.e. with small speed ˙φ). Indeed, Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14) are
necessary but not suﬃcient conditions for neglecting the acceleration term in Eq. (2.9);
a solution of the ﬁeld equations may well satisfy Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14), but still have a
large speed ˙φ and therefore not be in slow-rollover; this is the case, at early times, for
the exact solution presented in Sec. 4.

3 Equivalence between a constant potential and the

cosmological constant

In this section we discuss the de Sitter solution viewed as the prototype of inﬂation; the
similarity between slow roll inﬂation and the de Sitter-like expansion of the universe is
emphasized.

The de Sitter solution of the Einstein equations corresponds to exponential cosmic

expansion,

a(t) = a0 eHt ,

1/2

H = (cid:18)Λ
3(cid:19)

,

(3.1)

(3.2)

and is obtained by setting ρm = Pm = 0 in Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) and by allowing only
the cosmological constant in the right hand side of the ﬁeld equations. Historically, the
de Sitter solution has been known since the beginnings of general relativistic cosmology,
long before the idea of inﬂation. As seen in the previous section, the cosmological
constant is equivalent to a ﬂuid with the equation of state of quantum vacuum

P = −ρ ,

(3.3)

and therefore cosmological constant and vacuum energy are synonyms in modern cosmology4.
The equation of state (3.3) uniquely leads to the solution (3.1). The idea that quantum
vacuum should be considered as a form of matter and hence as a source of gravity in
the Einstein equations arose in the Russian school24.

While the original de Sitter solution (3.1) is associated to a geometrical cosmological
constant, matter can generate an eﬀective cosmological constant without the need of
introducing a geometrical Λ.
In fact, the vacuum energy of a scalar ﬁeld mimics a
geometric cosmological constant and the de Sitter expansion of the universe (3.1) can be
obtained as the result of scalar ﬁeld dynamics; the latter are rather trivial. A constant
scalar ﬁeld

φ = φ0 ,

(3.4)

with the potential V = V0 =constant solves the equations of inﬂation (2.10), (2.11), and
(2.9) and

a = a0 exp


s 8πGV0

3

t


5

(3.5)

for this solution. The idea that a constant, or almost constant, scalar ﬁeld appearing in
grand uniﬁed theories of particle physics plays the role of a vacuum state contributed to
the development of the idea of inﬂation24.

The de Sitter solution was the prototype of inﬂation4,8,11,12.14, but its importance for
inﬂation is not merely historical. In fact, most of the inﬂationary scenarios proposed
thus far share the common feature of being solved in the slow rollover approximation
(2.13) and (2.14), which implies that the expansion of the universe is quasi-exponential
during the slow rollover phase.
In fact, when the scalar ﬁeld is in slow rollover, the
dominance of the potential over the kinetic energy density, ( ˙φ)2/2 ≪ V , implies that
ρ ≈ V and P ≈ −V , and the equation of state is approximately (3.3), which is equivalent
to say that the scale factor is approximated by (3.1). More precisely, during slow roll
inﬂation, the scale factor is given by

a(t) = a0 exp(cid:18)Z H(t)dt(cid:19) ≃ a0 exp(cid:18)H0t +

H1
2

t2(cid:19) ,

(3.6)

where the constant term H0 in the expansion of H(t) is dominant.

In the rest of this paper we set the geometric cosmological constant to zero and we

only consider the eﬀective cosmological constant due to the scalar ﬁeld.

4 A new analytic solution

A new analytic solution can be derived in the classroom using only elementary calculus,
and is presented in this section. It diﬀers from the de Sitter solution, but it is derived
from Eqs. (2.2), (2.3), (2.7), and (2.8) under the same assumption of constant scalar
ﬁeld potential that led to the de Sitter solution (3.1).

One begins by noting that during slow roll inﬂation the nearly ﬂat section of the
scalar ﬁeld potential plays the role of an eﬀective cosmological constant. One then
sets out to determine all the solutions of the exact equations of inﬂation (2.9)-(2.11)
corresponding to a constant scalar ﬁeld potential

V = V0 = const.

The Klein-Gordon equation (2.9) reduces to

¨φ + 3H ˙φ = 0 ,

(4.1)

(4.2)

a trivial solution of which is given by ˙φ = 0, and corresponds to the de Sitter solution
discussed in the previous section. Another solution is possible when ˙φ 6= 0; in this case

6

Eq. (4.2) can be divided by ˙φ and immediately integrated to yield

˙φ = ±

C
a3 ,

(4.3)

where C is a positive integration constant. By substituting Eq. (4.3) into Eq. (2.7) and
the resulting expression of the energy density into Eq. (2.3) with Λ = 0, one obtains

2

(cid:18) ˙a
a(cid:19)

=

8πG

3   C 2

2a6 + V0! .

(4.4)

Upon use of the auxiliary variable y ≡ ln a, Eq. (4.4) can be reduced to a quadrature,

Z

(t − t0) ,

where α = C 2/(2V0) and t0 is an integration constant. By using

dz

Z

= ln √z + 1 − 1
√z + 1 + 1! ,

where z = αe−6y = αa−6, one easily obtains

√a6 + α − a3
√a6 + α + a3 = exp

∓12s 2πGV0

where the boundary condition a(t = 0) = 0 has been imposed. The function

(4.7)

(4.8)

is monotonically decreasing for x ≥ 0 and, since f (0) = 1, it is 0 < f < 1 for any
x > 0. The right hand side of Eq. (4.7) is always greater than unity when the positive
sign is adopted, hence Eq. (4.7) has no solutions in this case. By contrast, adopting the
negative sign in Eq. (4.7), one obtains after straightforward calculations

a(t) = a1 sinh1/3(cid:16)√3Λ t(cid:17) ,

7

(4.9)

where a1 = (4πGC 2/Λ)
ﬁeld

1/6

and Λ = 8πGV0. Eq. (4.3) yields the corresponding scalar

φ(t) = φ0 ln"tanh √3Λ t

2 !# + φ1 ,

(4.10)

where φ0 = ± (12πG)−1/2 and φ1 is an integration constant with the dimensions of a
mass. It is straightforward to check that the solution (4.9) and (4.10) satisﬁes Eqs. (2.9)
and (2.11); to check that Eq. (2.10) is also satisﬁed, it is suﬃcient to note that, given
Eqs. (2.9) and (2.11), Eq. (2.10) follows from the conservation equation (2.12).

The solution given by Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10) has a big bang singularity at t = 0, with

the asymptotic behavior

a(t) ≈ t1/3 ,

φ ≈ φ0 ln √3Λ t

2 ! + φ1

(4.11)

as t → 0. At t = 0 the scale factor vanishes while φ, ρ and P diverge. The initial speed
˙φ also diverges and the solution is deﬁnitely not in slow rollover, despite the fact that
the potential is ﬂat (in fact, constant). However, a slow rollover regime is approached as
the universe evolves: at late times t → +∞ the solution (4.9) and (4.10) is asymptotic
to the de Sitter solution (3.1). This is in agreement with the cosmic no-hair theorems,
as explained later.

5 Equation of state and scalar ﬁeld potential

We will now return to the exact solution (4.9) and (4.10) and interpret them in terms
of the equation of state relating pressure and energy density.

The eﬀective equation of state of the universe corresponding to Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10)

is given by

P
ρ

= 1 − 2 tanh2(cid:16)√3Λ t(cid:17) ;

it changes with time and interpolates between the equation of state P = ρ at early times
and the vacuum equation of state P = −ρ at late times. This feature of the solution
cautions against a possible misunderstanding, i.e. the belief that ﬁxing the scalar ﬁeld
potential V (φ) is equivalent to prescribing the equation of state. This belief would be
false: in fact, by ﬁxing the scalar ﬁeld potential to be constant, V = V0, one does not
uniquely determine the evolution of the universe: the solutions (4.9), (4.10) and (3.1),
(3.4) correspond to very diﬀerent physical situations and equations of state. In order

(5.1)

8

to completely specify the microphysics, it is not suﬃcient to prescribe the scalar ﬁeld
potential, but one must provide complete information on the state of the scalar ﬁeld (i.e.
also the ﬁeld’s “speed” ˙φ in our example).

For a general potential V , the eﬀective equation of state of the universe dominated

by a scalar ﬁeld is given by

P
ρ

=

˙φ2 − 2V
˙φ2 + 2V ≡ w(x) ,

(5.2)

where x ≡ ˙φ2/2V is the ratio between the kinetic and the potential energy densities
of the scalar φ. Under the usual assumption V ≥ 0 (which guarantees that the energy
density ρ is non-negative when ˙φ = 0), one has that, for x ≥ 0, the function w(x) =
(x2 − 1) (x2 + 1)−1
increases monotonically from its minimum wmin = −1 attained at
x = 0 to the horizontal asymptote +1 as x → +∞. The slow rollover regime corresponds
to the region |x| ≪ 1 and to w near its minimum, where the kinetic energy density of
φ is negligible in comparison to its potential energy density. As the kinetic energy
density ˙φ2/2 increases, the equation of state progressively deviates from P = −ρ and
the pressure becomes less and less negative; the system gradually moves away from the
slow rollover regime. At the equipartition between the kinetic and the potential energy
densities (x = 1), one has the “dust” equation of state P = 0. The pressure becomes
positive as x increases and, when the kinetic energy density completely dominates the
potential energy density (x ≫ 1), one ﬁnally reaches the equation of state P = ρ. The
solution (4.9) and (4.10) for V =const. spans the entire possible range for the equation
of state during the evolution of the universe, starting from x = +∞ at early times and
asymptotically evolving towards x = 0 at late times.

6 Discussion and conclusions

We now comment on the exact solution described by Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10) and compare
it to the de Sitter solution. In doing so, we will sharpen our understanding of the slow
rollover approximation and introduce an interesting cosmic no-hair theorem.

Both solutions (4.9), (4.10) and (3.1), (3.4) of the Einstein-Friedmann equations
correspond to a constant scalar ﬁeld potential V = V0 and exactly satisfy Eqs. (2.13) and
(2.14), which are necessary, but not suﬃcient, conditions for slow roll inﬂation. While the
de Sitter solution (3.1) corresponds to perfect slow roll ( ˙φ = 0) and to exact exponential
expansion of the universe, the solution (4.9), (4.10) exhibits signiﬁcant diﬀerences. It has
a big bang singularity at t = 0, while the de Sitter universe with inﬁnite age has existed

9

forever and the timescale over which the latter changes, q3/Λ, is constant (see Ref. 25

for a pedagogical discussion of the self-similarity properties of the de Sitter solution).
By contrast, the solution given by Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10) has a timescale given by the
Hubble time

(6.1)

H −1 = s 3

Λ

tanh(cid:16)√3Λ t(cid:17) ,

which is time-dependent and becomes nearly constant (with value q3/Λ) only for t →
+∞. Near the big bang singularity the universe obeys the equation of state P = ρ. In
this region, not only the solution fails to be in slow roll over the ﬂat potential, but it is not
even inﬂationary; even though the slow roll parameters ǫ and η exactly vanish, the speed
˙φ of the scalar ﬁeld is large. This clearly shows that the slow rollover approximation
must be formulated by means of conditions on the solutions of the ﬁeld equations, not
only as a set of conditions on the scalar ﬁeld potential V (φ). The relative ﬂatness of the
potential is not all there is to the slow rollover approximation.

Finally, the solution described by Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10) constitutes a useful example
to introduce the cosmic no-hair theorems26. The latter state that, when a positive
cosmological constant (or vacuum energy) Λ is present, the de Sitter solution (3.1),
(3.4) behaves as an attractor for the other solutions26. The example solution (4.9) and
(4.10) clearly illustrates this behavior and is particularly useful to introduce the cosmic
no-hair theorems (the proof of which requires more sophisticated mathematics than the
ones used in this paper26). In spite of the fact that the solution (4.9) and (4.10) begins
at early times very diﬀerently from a de Sitter solution, it converges exponentially fast to
the latter as time progresses. In fact, the ratio of the (suitably normalized) scale factors

(4.9) and (3.1) is given by h1 − exp(cid:16)−2√3Λ t(cid:17)i1/3

, which tends to unity at large times t,
while the scalar ﬁeld (4.10) asymptotically converges to the constant φ1. This happens
because the de Sitter solution (3.1) is an attractor point that captures the orbits of the
solutions in the phase space, including the orbit of the exact solution (4.9) and (4.10).
Indeed, the cosmic no-hair theorems are more general, stating that the de Sitter space
is approached even starting from an anisotropic spacetime26.

As a conclusion, cosmological inﬂation is described by simple ordinary diﬀerential
equations and its basic features can be discussed in the classroom without the need of
complicated mathematical tools. The phenomenological approach to inﬂation adopted
in recent years by the community of cosmologists supports the introduction of the inﬂa-
tionary paradigm without the need of a lengthy premise about advanced particle physics
to justify it. Indeed, the basic features of inﬂation can be grasped without the knowledge
of high energy theories.

10

The increasing number of pedagogical introductions to inﬂation seems to reﬂect this
point of view. The exact solution shown in this paper should help the circulation of
simple but signiﬁcant ideas of modern cosmology.

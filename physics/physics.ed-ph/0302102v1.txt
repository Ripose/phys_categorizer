Abstrat

It is shown in this paper that one does not need to use just exponential dump-

ing fator when omputing the Rutherford formula within Born approximation.

Text, whih is very simple, might be of interest for physis students as well as for

physis teahers.

Example 1

The sattering amplitude for a partile of mass m in the spherially symmetri
potential energy V (r) within the Born approximation is given by

f (θ) = −

drrV (r) sin(κr)

,

where ~κ = ~q − ~q′
vetor of sattered partile. The vetor κ is related to the sattering axial angle
θ by the equation κ = 2q sin(θ/2). If we insert the Coulomb law

, ~q is the wave vetor of inident partile and ~q′

is the wave

V (r) =

into (1) instead of V we get

f (θ) = −

dr sin(κr)

The above written integral does not onverge, of ourse. The standard proedure

to make the integral to have a sense is to regularize the Coulomb law by mul-

tiplying it by the funtion exp(−µr), where µ > 0 and after having performed

not to be of the form exp(−µr) .

. We will show that the regularizator has

Let {gn(r)}∞

n=1 be the sequene of monotonially dereasing funtions de(cid:28)ned
on the half-line r ≥ 0 suh that {gn} onverges point-wise to 1 and we request
that gn(0) = 1 and limr→∞ gn(r) = 0. Moreover we request that the derivatives
g′
n(r) approah zero at r → ∞ uniformly with respet to n.

The sattering amplitude (1) for the potential energy

The integral In(κ) exists (as Riemann integral) due to our assumptions on the
funtions gn and the Dirihlet's riterion. Let us ompute the integral In(κ) per

partes. We get

In(κ) =

.

Our task is to show that the seond term goes to zero as n goes to in(cid:28)nity. But
this is true beause of the properties of the sequene {gn} and beause of the fat
that there exists suh positive onstant K > 0 that for all A > 0 we have

Therefore we have

from whih we get the di(cid:27)erential ross-setion

Example 2

In this setion we will show another possibility how to regularize the Coulomb

potential. Now, let us take the potential

Then the sattering amplitude has the form

V (r, a) =

0 < a < 2 .

So, we have to ompute the following integral

To do this it would be useful to realise that the following identity holds

I(a, κ) =

from whih we get in the limit a → 0+

the amplitude

f (θ) = −

2me2
4πǫ0~2κ2

whih leads just to the Rutherford formula.

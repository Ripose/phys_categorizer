PREFACE.

Theory of relativity is a physical discipline which arose in
the beginning of XX-th century.
It has dramatically changed
traditional notion about the structure of the Universe. Eﬀects
predicted by this theory becomes essential only when we describe
processes at high velocities close to light velocity

c = 2.998 · 105km/sec.

In XIX-th century there was the only theory dealing with such
processes, this was theory of electromagnetism. Development of
theory of electromagnetism in XIX-th century became a premise
for arising theory of relativity.

In this book I follow historical sequence of events. In Chapter I
electrostatics and magnetostatics are explained starting with ﬁrst
experiments on interaction of charges and currents. Chapter II is
devoted to classical electrodynamics based on Maxwell equations.
In the beginning of Chapter III Lorentz transformations are
derived as transformations keeping form of Maxwell equations.
Physical interpretation of such transformation requires uniting
space and time into one four-dimensional continuum (Minkowsky
space) where there is no ﬁxed direction for time axis. Upon
introducing four-dimensional space-time in Chapter III classical
electrodynamics is rederived in the form invariant with respect to
Lorentz transformations.

In Chapter IV variational approach to describing electromag-
netic ﬁeld and other material ﬁelds in special relativity is con-
sidered. Use of curvilinear coordinates in Minkowsky space and
appropriate diﬀerential-geometric methods prepares background
for passing to general relativity.

6

In Chapter V Einstein’s theory of gravitation (general rela-
tivity) is considered, this theory interprets gravitational ﬁeld as
curvature of space-time itself.

This book is addressed to Math. students. Therefore I paid
much attention to logical consistence of given material. References

in those places, where I
need additional assumptions which do not follow from previous
material, detailed comment is given.

I hope that assiduous and interested reader with suﬃcient
preliminary background could follow all mathematical calculations
and, upon reading this book, would get pleasure of understanding
how harmonic is the nature of things.

shentseva, and A. I. Utarbaev for reading and correcting Russian

CHAPTER I

ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS

§ 1. Basic experimental facts and unit systems.

Quantitative description of any physical phenomenon requires
measurements. In mechanics we have three basic quantities and
three basic units of measure: for mass, for length, and for time.

Quantity

time

Unit
in SI

m

in SGS

of units

1 kg = 103 g

1 m = 102 cm

1 sec = 1 sec

Units of measure for other quantities are derived from the
above basic units. Thus, for instance, for measure unit of force
due to Newton’s second law we get:
(1) N = kg · m · sec−2 in SI,
(2) dyn = g · cm · sec−2 in SGS.

Unit systems SI and SGS are two most popular unit systems
in physics. Units for measuring mechanical quantities (velocity,
acceleration, force, energy, power) in both systems are deﬁned in
quite similar way. Proportions relating units for these quantities

can be derived from proportions for basic quantities (see table
above). However,
in choosing units for electric and magnetic
quantities these systems diﬀer essentially.

Choice of measure unit for electric charge in SGS is based on

Coulomb law describing interaction of two charged point.

Coulomb law. Two charged points with charges of the same
sign are repulsing, while points with charges of opposite signs are
attracting with force proportional to
quantities of their charges and in-
verse proportional to square of dis-
tance between them:

(1.1)

F ∼

Q1 Q2
r2

.

Measure unit of charge in SGS is
chosen such that coeﬃcient in for-
mula (1.1) is equal to unity. Hence
we have the following relation:

Fig. 1.1

unit of charge in SGS = dyn 1/2 · cm= g 1/2 · cm3/2 · sec−1.

Coulomb law itself then is written in form of the equality

(1.2)

F =

Q1 Q2
r2

.

Force F deﬁned by the relationship (1.2) is very strong. How-
ever, in everyday life it does not reveal itself. This is due to the
screening. The numbers of positive and negative charges in nature
are exactly balanced. Atoms and molecules, which constitute all
observable matter around us, have the same amount of positive
and negative charges. Therefore they are electrically neutral in

§ 1. BASIC FACTS AND UNIT SYSTEMS.

whole. Force (1.2) reveals itself in form of chemical links only
when atoms are pulled together.

Electric current arises as a result of motion of charged points.
This occurs in metallic conductor, which usually have lengthy
form (form of wire). Current in such conductor is determined by
the amount of charge passing through it within the unit of time.
Therefore for unit of current we have:

unit of current in SGS = unit of charge in SGS · sec−1 =
= g 1/2 · cm 3/2 · sec−2.

Let’s consider straight conducting rod of the length l. Current
in it leads to misbalance of charges in its ends. Charges of deﬁnite
sign move to one end of the rod, while lack of these charges in
the other end of the rod is detected as the charge of opposite
sign. Then Coulomb force (1.2) arises that tends to recover
balance of charges in electrically neutral rod. This means that
in such rod current could not ﬂow in constant direction during
long time. Another situation we have with conductor of the
form of ring or circuit. Here current does not break the balance
of charges. Direct current can ﬂow in it during unlimitedly
long time. Circular conductor itself thereby remains electrically
neutral and no Coulomb forces arise.

In spite of absence of Coulomb forces, in experiments the inter-
action of two circular conductors with currents was detected. This
interaction has other nature, it is not due to electrical, but due to
magnetic forces. The magnitude of magnetic forces depends es-
sentially on the shape and mutual arrangement of circular conduc-
tors. In order to reveal quantitative characteristics for magnetic
forces one should maximally simplify the geometry of conduc-
tors. For this purpose they are deformed so that each possesses
straight rod-shaped part of suﬃciently big length l. These rod-

10

CHAPTER I. ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS.

shaped parts are arranged par-
allel to each other with the dis-
tance r between them.
In the
limit, when l is much larger than
r, this conﬁguration of conduc-
tors can be treated as a pair
of inﬁnitely long parallel conduc-
tors. In experiments it was found
that such conductors do interact
according to the following law.

Fig. 1.2

Ampere law. Force of inter-
two inﬁnite parallel
action of
conductors with currents per unit
length of them is proportional ti the values of currents in them
and inverse proportional to the distance between them:

(1.3)

(1.4)

Two co-directed currents attract each other, while opposite di-
rected currents repulse each other.

The unit of current in SGS was already introduced above.
Therefore coeﬃcient of proportionality in formula (1.3) is unique
quantity that should be determined in experiment. Here is the
measure unit for this coeﬃcient: sec 2 · cm−2.
It coincides with
inverse square of velocity. Therefore formula (1.3) in SGS is
written as

F
l

∼

I1 I2
r

.

F

Constant c in (1.4) is a velocity constant. The value of this
constant is determined experimentally:

(1.5)

c ≈ 2.998 · 1010 cm/sec.

§ 1. BASIC FACTS AND UNIT SYSTEMS.

11

As we shall see below, constant c in (1.5) coincides with velocity
of light in vacuum. Numeric coeﬃcient 2 in (1.4) is introduced
intentionally for to provide such coincidence.

In SI measure unit of current 1 A (one ampere) is a basic unit.

It is determined such that formula (1.3) is written as

F
l

(1.6)

2 µ0

Here π = 3.14 . . . is exact (though it is irrational) mathematical
constant with no measure unit. Constant µ0 is called magnetic
susceptibility of vacuum. It has the measure unit:

I1 I2
r

=

.

(1.7)

µ0 = 4π · 10−7N · A−2.

But, in contrast to constant c in (1.5), it is exact constant. Its
value should not be determined experimentally. One could choose
it to be equal to unity, but the above value (1.7) for this constant
was chosen by convention when SI system was established. Due
to this value of constant (1.7) current of 1 ampere appears to
be in that range of currents, that really appear in industrial and
household devices. Coeﬃcient 4π in denominator (1.6) is used in
order to simplify some other formulas, which are more often used
for engineering calculations in electric technology.

Being basic unit in SI, unit of current ampere is used for
deﬁning unit of charge of 1 coulomb: 1C = 1A · 1sec. Then
coeﬃcient of proportionality in Coulomb law (1.1) appears to be
not equal to unity. In SI Coulomb law is written as

(1.8)

F =

In con-
Constant ǫ0 is called dielectric permittivity of vacuum.
trast to constant µ0 in (1.7) this is physical constant determined
experimentally:

ǫ0 ≈ 8.85 · 10−12 C 2 · N−1 · m−2.

CHAPTER I. ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS.

Constants (1.5), (1.7), and (1.9) are related to each other by the
following equality:

(1.10)

c =

≈ 2.998 · 108 m/sec.

From the above consideration we see that SGS and SI systems
diﬀer from each other not only in the scale of units, but in for-
mulas for two fundamental laws: Coulomb law and Ampere law.
SI better suits for engineering calculations. However, derivation
of many formulas in this system appears more huge than in SGS.
Therefore below in this book we use SGS system.

Comparing Coulomb law and Ampere law we see that electrical
and magnetic forces reveal themselves in quite diﬀerent way.
However, they have common origin: they both are due to electric
charges. Below we shall see that their relation is much more
close. Therefore theories of electricity and magnetism are usually
united into one theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Theory of
electromagnetism is a theory with one measurable constant: this
is light velocity c. Classical mechanics (without Newton’s theory
of gravitation) has no measurable constants. Newton’s theory of
gravitation has one constant:

(1.11)

γ ≈ 6.67 · 10−8 cm3 · g−1 · sec−2.

This theory is based on Newton’s fourth law formulated as follows.

Universal law of gravitation. Two point masses attract
each other with the force proportional to their masses and in-
verse proportional to the square of distance between them.

Universal law of gravitation is given by the same formula

§ 2. CONCEPT OF NEAR ACTION.

13

in both systems: in SGS and in SI.

According to modern notion of nature classical mechanics and
Newton’s theory of gravitation are approximate theories. Cur-
rently they are replaced by special theory of relativity and general
theory of relativity. Historically they appeared as a result of
development of the theory of electromagnetism. Below we keep
this historical sequence in explaining all three theories.

Exercise 1.1. On the base of above facts ﬁnd quantitative re-

lation of measure units for charge and current in SGS and SI.

§ 2. Concept of near action.

Let’s consider pair of charged bodies, which are initially ﬁxed,
and let’s do the following mental experiment with them. When
we start moving second body apart from ﬁrst one, the distance r
begins increasing and consequently force of Coulomb interaction
(1.2) will decrease.
In this situation we have natural question:
how soon after second body starts moving second body will feel
change of Coulomb force of interaction ? There are two possible
answers to this question:

(1) immediately;
(2) with some delay depending on the distance between bodies.
First answer is known as concept of distant action. Taking this
concept we should take formula (1.2) as absolutely exact formula
applicable for charges at rest and for moving charges as well.

Second answer is based on the concept of near action. Ac-
cording to this concept, each interaction (and electric interaction
among others) can be transmitted immediately only to the point
of space inﬁnitesimally close to initial one. Transmission of any
action to ﬁnite distance should be considered as a process of
successive transmission from point to point. This process always
In
leads to some ﬁnite velocity of transmission for any action.

14

CHAPTER I. ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS.

the framework of the concept of near action Coulomb law (1.2) is
treated as approximate law, which is exact only for the charges
at rest that stayed at rest during suﬃciently long time so that
process of transmission of electric interaction has been terminated.
Theory of electromagnetism has measurable constant c (light
velocity (1.5)), which is ﬁrst pretender for the role of transmission
velocity of electric and magnetic interactions. For this reason
electromagnetic theory is much more favorable as compared to
Newton’s theory of gravitation.

The value of light velocity is a very large quantity. If we settle
an experiment of measuring Coulomb force at the distances of the
order of r ≈ 10 cm, for the time of transmission of interaction we
would get times of the order of t ≈ 3 · 10−10 sec. Experimental
technique of XIX-th century was unable to detect such a short
interval of time. Therefore the problem of choosing concept could
not be solved experimentally. In XIX-th century it was subject for
contests. The only argument against the concept of distant action
that time, quite likely, was its straightness, its self-completeness,
and hence its scarcity.

In present time concept of near action is commonly accepted.
Now we have the opportunity for testing it experimentally in the
scope of electromagnetic phenomena. Let’s study this concept
more attentively. According to the concept of near action, process
of transmitting interaction to far distance exhibits an inertia.
Starting at one point, where moving charge is placed, for some
time this process exist in hidden form with no inﬂuence to both
charges.
In order to describe this stage of process we need to
introduce new concept. This concept is a ﬁeld.

Field is a material entity able to ﬁll the whole space and able
to act upon other material bodies transmitting mutual interaction
of them.

The number of ﬁelds deﬁnitely known to scientists is not big.
There are only four fundamental ﬁelds: strong ﬁeld, weak ﬁeld,

§ 3. SUPERPOSITION PRINCIPLE.

15

electromagnetic ﬁeld, and gravitational ﬁeld. Strong and weak
ﬁelds are very short distance ﬁelds, they reveal themselves only
in atomic nuclei, in collisions and decay of elementary particles,
and in stellar objects of extremely high density, which are called
neutron stars. Strong and weak interactions and ﬁelds are not
considered in this book.

There are various terms using the word ﬁeld: vector ﬁeld, tensor
ﬁeld, spinor ﬁeld, gauge ﬁeld, and others. These are mathematical
terms reﬂecting some deﬁnite properties of real physical ﬁelds.

§ 3. Superposition principle.

Let’s apply concept of near action to Coulomb law for two
charged points. Coulomb force in the framework of this concept
can be interpreted as follows: ﬁrst charge produces electric ﬁeld
around itself, and this ﬁeld acts upon other charge. Result of such
action is detected as a force F applied to second charge. Force
is vectorial quantity. Let’s denote by F vector of force and take
into account the direction of this vector determined by verbal
statement of Coulomb law above. This yields

(3.1)

(3.2)

F = Q1 Q2

r2 − r1
|r2 − r1|3 .

E = Q1

r2 − r1
|r2 − r1|3 .

Here r1 and r2 are radius-vectors of points, where charges Q1 and
Q2 are placed. Let’s consider vector E determined as the ratio
E = F/Q2. For this vector from formula (3.1) we derive

Vector E depends upon the position of ﬁrst charge and upon
its value. It depends also on the position of second charge, but
it doesn’t depend on the value of second charge. One can take

16

CHAPTER I. ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS.

vector E for quantitative measure of electric ﬁeld produced by ﬁrst
charge Q1 at the point r2, where second charge is placed. Vector
E can be determined by formula (3.2) or it can be measured
experimentally. For this purpose one should place test charge q
to the point r2 and one should measure Coulomb force F acting
upon this test charge. Then vector E is determined by division of
F by the value of test charge q:

(3.3)

E = F/q.

Now consider more complicated situation.

Suppose that
charges Q1, . . . , Qn are placed at the points r1, . . . , rn. They
produce electric ﬁeld around them, and this ﬁeld acts upon test
charge q placed at the point r. This action reveals as a force F
applied to the charge q. Again we can deﬁne vector E of the form
(3.3) and take it for the quantitative measure of electric ﬁeld at
the point r. This vector is called vector of intensity of electric
ﬁeld or simply vector of electric ﬁeld at that point.

Generally speaking, in this case one cannot be a priori sure
that vector E does not depend on the quantity of test charge q.
However, there is the following experimental fact.

Superposition principle. Electric ﬁeld E at the point r
produced by a system of point charges Q1, . . . , Qn is a vectorial
sum of electric ﬁelds that would be produced at this point by each
charge Q1, . . . , Qn separately.

Superposition principle combined with Coulomb law leads to
the following formula for the intensity of electric ﬁeld produced
by a system of point charges at the point r:

(3.4)

E(r) =

Qi

n

i=1
X

r − ri
|r − ri|3 .

§ 3. SUPERPOSITION PRINCIPLE.

17

Using superposition principle, one can pass from point charges
to continuously distributed charges. Suppose that the number of
point charges tends to inﬁnity: n → ∞.
In such limit sum in
formula (3.4) is replaced by integral over 3-dimensional space:

(3.5)

E(r) =

ρ(˜r)

r − ˜r
|r − ˜r|3 d3˜r.

Z

Here ρ(˜r) is spatial density of charge at the point ˜r. This value
designates the amount of charge per unit volume.

In order to ﬁnd force acting on test charge q we should invert

formula (3.3). As a result we obtain

(3.6)

F = q E(r).

Force acting on a charge q in electric ﬁeld is equal to the product
of the quantity of this charge by the vector of intensity of ﬁeld at
the point, where charge is placed. However, charge q also produces
electric ﬁeld. Does it experience the action of its own ﬁeld ? For
point charges the answer to this question is negative. This fact
should be treated as a supplement to principle of superposition.
Total force acting on a system of distributed charges in electric
ﬁeld is determined by the following integral:

(3.7)

F =

ρ(r) E(r) d3r.

Z

Field E(r) in (3.7) is external ﬁeld produced by external charges.
Field of charges with density ρ(r) is not included into E(r).

Concluding this section, note that formulas (3.4) and (3.5) hold
only for charges at rest, which stayed at rest for suﬃciently long
time so that process of interaction transmitting reached the point
of observation r. Fields produced by such systems of charges are
called static ﬁelds, while branch of theory of electromagnetism
studying such ﬁelds is called electrostatics.

vt

Ampere law of interaction of parallel conductors with currents
is an analog of Coulomb law for magnetic interactions. Accord-
ing to near action principle, force F
arises as a result of action of mag-
netic ﬁeld produced by a current in
ﬁrst conductor upon second conduc-
tor. However, parallel conductors
cannot be treated as point objects:
formula (1.4) holds only for l ≫ r.
In order to get quantitative measure
of magnetic ﬁeld at some point r
let’s consider current I2 in (1.4) as
a ﬂow of charged particles of charge
q each, and each moving along con-
If we denote by ν the number

of such particles per unit length of conductor, then in the whole
length l we would have N = ν l particles. Then during time in-
terval t we would have n = ν v t particles passing through a ﬁxed
cross-section of the conductor. They carry charge amounting to
Q = q ν v t. Therefore for current I2 in second conductor we get

Fig. 4.1

I2 = Q/t = q ν v.

Upon calculating force acting on a segment of conductor of the
length l by formula (1.4) we should divide it by the number of
particles N contained in this segment. Then for the force per each
particle we derive

(4.1)

F =

.

Formula determines (4.1) qualitative dependence of F on q and
on v: each charged particle moving in magnetic ﬁeld experiences

§ 4. LORENTZ FORCE AND . . .

19

a force proportional to its charge q and to the magnitude of its
velocity vector v = |v|, i. e. we have proportionality

(4.2)

F ∼ q v.

Force and velocity both are vectorial quantities. Simplest way to
relate two vectors F and v is to use vector product of v with
some third vectorial quantity H:

(4.3)

F =

[v, H(r)].

q
c

Here c is scalar constant equal to light velocity. Vectorial quantity
H(r) is a quantitative measure of magnetic ﬁeld at the point r.
It is called intensity of magnetic ﬁeld at that point. Scalar factor
1/c in (4.3) is used for to make H to be measured by the same
units as intensity of electric ﬁeld E in (3.6). Force F acting on
a point charge in magnetic ﬁeld is called Lorentz force. Total
Lorentz force acting on a charge in electromagnetic ﬁeld is a sum
of two components: electric component and magnetic component:

(4.4)

F = q E +

[v, H].

q
c

Formula (4.4) extends formula (3.6) for the case of general electro-
magnetic ﬁelds. It holds not only for static but for time-dependent
(non-static) ﬁelds. Surely the above derivation of formula (4.4) is
empiric. Actually, one should treat formula (4.4) as experimental
fact that do not contradict to another experimental fact (1.4)
within theory being developed.

Let’s turn back to our conductors. Formula (4.3) can be
interpreted in terms of currents. Each segment of unit length of
a conductor with current I in magnetic ﬁeld H experiences the
force

rected along current in it. Total force acting on circular conductor
with current I is determined by contour integral

F =

[τ (s), H(r(s))] ds,

where s is natural parameter on contour (length) and r(s) is
vector-function determining shape of contour in parametric form.
Let’s consider the case of two parallel conductors. Force F now
can be calculated by formula (4.5) assuming that ﬁrst conductor
produces magnetic ﬁeld H(r) that acts upon second conductor.
Auxiliary experiment shows that vector H is perpendicular to
the plane of these two parallel conductors. The magnitude of
magnetic ﬁeld H = |H| can be determined by formula (4.1):

Here r is the distance from observation point to the conductor
producing ﬁeld at that point.

Magnetic ﬁeld produced by conductor with current satisﬁes
superposition principle.
In particular, ﬁeld of inﬁnite straight
line conductor (4.7) is composed by ﬁelds produced by separate
segments of this conductor. One cannot measure magnetic ﬁeld of
separate segment experimentally since one cannot keep constant
current is such separate segment for suﬃciently long time. But
theoretically one can consider inﬁnitesimally small segment of
conductor with current of the length ds. And one can write
formula for magnetic ﬁeld produced by such segment of conductor:

(4.8)

dH(r) =

1
c

[I τ , r − ˜r]
|r − ˜r|3

ds.

§ 5. CURRENT DENSITY AND . . .

21

Here τ is unit vector determining spatial orientation of inﬁnitesi-
mal conductor. It is always taken to be directed along current I.
In practice, when calculating magnetic ﬁelds produced by circular
conductors, formula (4.8) is taken in integral form:

(4.9)

H(r) =

1
c

[I τ (s), r − ˜r(s)]
|r − ˜r(s)|3

ds.

I

Like in (4.6), here s is natural parameter on the contour and ˜r(s)
is vectorial function determining shape of this contour. Therefore
τ (s) = d˜r(s)/ds. The relationship (4.8) and its integral form (4.9)
constitute Biot-Savart-Laplace law for circular conductors with
current.

Biot-Savart-Laplace law in form (4.8) cannot be tested exper-
imentally. However,
in integral form (4.9) for each particular
conductor it yields some particular expression for H(r). This
expression then can be veriﬁed in experiment.

Exercise 4.1. Using relationships (4.6) and (4.9), derive the
law of interaction of parallel conductors with current in form (1.4).

Exercise 4.2. Find magnetic ﬁeld of the conductor with cur-

rent having the shape of circle of the radius a.

§ 5. Current density
and the law of charge conservation.

Conductors that we have considered above are kind of ideal-
ization. They are linear, we assume them having no thickness.
Real conductor always has some thickness. This fact is ignored
when we consider long conductors like wire. However, in some
cases thickness of a conductor cannot be ignored. For example, if
we consider current in electrolytic bath or if we study current in
plasma in upper layers of atmosphere. Current in bulk conductors
can be distributed non-uniformly within volume of conductor.

CHAPTER I. ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS.

The concept of current density j is best one for describing such
situation.

Current density is vectorial quantity depending on a point of
j = j(r). Vector of current density j(r)
conducting medium:
indicate the direction of charge transport at the point r.
Its
magnitude j = | j | is determined by the amount of charge passing
through unit area perpendicular to vector j per unit time. Let’s
mark mentally some restricted domain Ω within bulk conducting
medium.
Its boundary is smooth closed surface. Due to the
above deﬁnition of current density the amount of charge ﬂowing
out from marked domain per unit time is determined by surface
integral over the boundary of this domain, while charge enclosed
within this domain is given by spatial integral:

(5.1)

Q =

ρ d3r,

J =

j, n

dS.

ZΩ

Z∂Ω (cid:10)

(cid:11)

Here n is unit vector of external normal to the surface ∂Ω
restricting domain Ω.

Charge conservation law is one more fundamental experimental
fact reﬂecting the nature of electromagnetism.
In its classical
form it states that charges cannot appear from nowhere and
cannot disappear as well, they can only move from one point to
another. Modern physics insert some correction to this statement:
charges appear and can disappear in processes of creation and
annihilation of pairs of elementary particles consisting of particle
and corresponding antiparticle. However, even in such creation-
annihilation processes total balance of charge is preserved since
total charge of a pair consisting of particle and antiparticle is
always equal to zero. When applied to integrals (5.1) charge
˙Q = −J. This relationship means that
conservation law yields:
decrease of charge enclosed within domain Ω is always due to

§ 5. CURRENT DENSITY AND . . .

23

charge leakage through the boundary and conversely increase of
charge is due to incoming ﬂow through the boundary of this
domain. Let’s write charge conservation law in the following
form:

Current density j is a vector depending on a point of conducting
medium. Such objects in diﬀerential geometry are called vector
ﬁelds. Electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld H are other examples
of vector ﬁelds. Surface integral J in (5.1) is called ﬂow of vector
ﬁeld j through the surface ∂Ω. For smooth vector ﬁeld any surface
integral like J can be transformed to spatial integral by means of
Ostrogradsky-Gauss formula. When applied to (5.2), this yields

Note that Ω in (5.3) is an arbitrary domain that we marked men-
tally within conducting medium. This means that the expression
being integrated in (5.3) should be identically zero:

The relationships (5.2) and (5.4) are integral and diﬀerential
forms of charge conservation law respectively. The relationship
(5.4) also is known as continuity equation for electric charge.

When applied to bulk conductors with distributed current j

within them, formula (4.6) is rewritten as follows:

(5.5)

F =

[ j(r), H(r)] d3r.

Biot-Savart-Laplace law for such conductors also is written in

(5.6)

H(r) =

[ j(˜r), r − ˜r]

In order to derive formulas (5.5) and (5.6) from formulas (4.6)
and (4.8) one should represent bulk conductor as a union of linear
conductors, then use superposition principle and pass to the limit
by the number of linear conductors n → ∞.

§ 6. Electric dipole moment.

Let’s consider some conﬁguration of distributed charge with
density ρ(r) which is concentrated within some restricted domain
Ω. Let R be maximal linear size of the domain Ω. Let’s choose
coordinates with origin within this domain Ω and let’s choose
observation point r which is far enough from the domain of
charge concentration: |r| ≫ R. In order to ﬁnd electric ﬁeld E(r)
produced by charges in Ω we use formula (3.5):

(6.1)

E(r) =

ρ(˜r)

r − ˜r
|r − ˜r|3 d3˜r.

ZΩ

Since domain Ω in (6.1) is restricted, we have inequality |˜r| ≤ R.
Using this inequality along with |r| ≫ R, we can write Taylor
expansion for the fraction in the expression under integration in
(6.1). As a result we get power series in powers of ratio ˜r/|r|:

Substituting (6.2) into (6.1), we get the following expression for

First summand in (6.3) is Coulomb ﬁeld of point charge Q placed
at the origin, where Q is total charge enclosed in the domain Ω.
It is given by integral (5.1).

Second summand in (6.3) is known as ﬁeld of point dipole
placed at the origin. Vector D there is called dipole moment. For
charges enclosed within domain Ω it is given by integral

(6.4)

D =

ρ(˜r) ˜r d3˜r.

is leading term in asymptotics for electrostatic ﬁeld (3.4) or
(3.5) as r → ∞. Note that for the system of charges with
Q = 0 dipole moment D calculated by formulas (6.4) and (6.5)
is invariant quantity. This quantity remains unchanged when
we move all charges to the same distance at the same direction
without changing their mutual orientation: ˜r → ˜r + r0.

26

CHAPTER I. ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS.

Exercise 6.1. Concept of charge density is applicable to point
charges as well. However, in this case ρ(r) is not ordinary function.
It is distribution. For example point charge Q placed at the point
r = 0 is represented by density ρ(r) = Q δ(r), where δ(r) is Dirac’s
delta-function. Consider the density

Applying formula (5.1), calculate total charge Q corresponding to
this density (6.7). Using formula (6.4) calculate dipole moment
for distributed charge (6.7) and ﬁnd electrostatic ﬁeld produced
by this charge. Compare the expression obtained with (6.6) and
explain why system of charges described by the above density (6.7)
is called point dipole.

Exercise 6.2. Using formula (3.7) ﬁnd the force acting on

point dipole in external electric ﬁeld E(r).

§ 7. Magnetic moment.

Let’s consider situation similar to that of previous section.
Suppose some distributed system of currents is concentrated in
some restricted domain near origin. Let R be maximal linear
size of this domain Ω. Current density j(r) is smooth vector-
function, which is nonzero only within Ω and which vanishes at
the boundary ∂Ω and in outer space. Current density j(r) is
assumed to be stationary, i. e. it doesn’t depend on time, and it
doesn’t break charge balance, i. e. ρ(r) = 0. Charge conservation
law applied to this situation yields

(7.1)

div j = 0.

§ 7. MAGNETIC MOMENT.

In order to calculate magnetic ﬁeld H(r) we use Biot-Savart-
Laplace law written in integral form (5.6):

(7.2)

H(r) =

1
c

[ j(˜r), r − ˜r]
|r − ˜r|3

d3˜r.

ZΩ

Assuming that |r| ≫ R, we take Taylor expansion (6.2) and
substitute it into (7.2). As a result we get

(7.3)

[ j(˜r), r]
c |r|3 d3˜r +

Lemma 7.1. First integral in (7.3) is identically equal to zero.

Proof. Denote this integral by H1(r). Let’s choose some

arbitrary constant vector e and consider scalar product

Then deﬁne vector a and function f (˜r) as follows:

a =

[r, e]
c |r|3 ,

f (˜r) =

a, ˜r

.

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

Vector a does not depend on ˜r, therefore in calculating integral
(7.4) we can take it for constant vector. For this vector we derive

28

a = grad f . Substituting this formula into the (7.4), we get

ZΩ

Last integral in (7.5) is equal to zero due to (7.1). Previous inte-
gral is transformed to surface integral by means of Ostrogradsky-
Gauss formula. It is also equal to zero since j(˜r) vanishes at the
boundary of domain Ω. Therefore

Now vanishing of vector H1(r) follows from formula (7.6) since e
is arbitrary constant vector. Lemma 7.1 is proved. (cid:3)

Let’s transform second integral in (7.3). First of all we denote
it by H2(r). Then, taking an arbitrary constant vector e, we form
scalar product

. This scalar product can be brought to

If one adds gradient of
arbitrary function f (˜r) to b(˜r), this wouldn’t change integral
in (7.7). Formulas (7.5) and (7.6) form an example of such
invariance. Let’s specify function f (˜r), choosing it as follows:

Now let’s use well-known identity [a, [b, c]] = b

Assuming that a = ˜r, b = r, and c = [r, e], we transform the

Like electric dipole moment D of the system with zero total

substitute (3.5) into ﬁrst integral (8.1) and then let’s change order

Inner surface integral in (8.2) is an integral of explicit function.
This integral can be calculated explicitly:

dS =

4π, if ˜r ∈ Ω.

(

Z∂Ω (cid:10)

Here by Ω = Ω ∪ ∂Ω we denote closure of the domain Ω.

In order to prove the relationship (8.3) let’s consider vector

ﬁeld m(r) given by the following formula:

(8.3)

(8.4)

m(r) =

r − ˜r
|r − ˜r|3 .

Vector ﬁeld m(r) is smooth everywhere except for one special
point r = ˜r.
In all regular points of this vector ﬁeld by direct
calculations we ﬁnd div m = 0. If ˜r 6∈ Ω special point of the ﬁeld
m is out of the domain Ω. Therefore in this case we can apply
Ostrogradsky-Gauss formula to (8.3):

This proves ﬁrst case in formula (8.3). In order to prove second
case, when ˜r ∈ Ω, we use tactical maneuver. Let’s consider spher-
ical ǫ-neighborhood O = Oǫ of special point r = ˜r. For suﬃciently
small ǫ this neighborhood O = Oǫ is completely enclosed into the

§ 8. INTEGRAL EQUATIONS . . .

domain Ω. Then from zero divergency condition div m = 0 for
the ﬁeld given by formula (8.4) we derive

The value of last integral over sphere ∂O in (8.5) is found by direct
calculation, which is not diﬃcult. Thus, formula (8.3) is proved.
Substituting (8.3) into (8.2) we get the following relationship:

This relationship (8.6) can be formulated as a theorem.

Theorem (on the ﬂow of electric ﬁeld). Flow of electric ﬁeld
through the boundary of restricted domain is equal to total charge
enclosed within this domain multiplied by 4π.

Now let’s consider ﬂow of magnetic ﬁeld H in (8.1). Static
magnetic ﬁeld is determined by formula (5.6). Let’s substitute
H(r) given by (5.6) into second integral (8.1), then change the
order of integration in resulting double integral:

It’s clear that in calculating inner integral over the surface ∂Ω
vector j can be taken for constant. Now consider the ﬁeld

(8.8)

m(r) =

c |r − ˜r|3 .

34

CHAPTER I. ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS.

Like (8.4), this vector ﬁeld (8.8) has only one singular point r = ˜r.
Divergency of this ﬁeld is equal to zero, this fact can be veriﬁed
by direct calculations. As appears in this case, singular point
makes no eﬀect to the value of surface integral in (8.7). Instead
of (8.3) in this case we have the following formula:

dS = 0.

For ˜r 6∈ Ω the relationship (8.9) follows from div m = 0 by

relationship similar to the above relationship (8.5):

However, the value of surface integral over sphere ∂O in this case

which is formulated as the following theorem.

Theorem (on the ﬂow of magnetic ﬁeld). Total ﬂow of mag-

Let r(s) be vectorial parametric equation of some closed spatial
curve Γ being the rim for some open surface S, i. e. Γ = ∂S. Open
surface S means that S and Γ have empty intersection. By S we

Due to (8.13) we need to consider vector ﬁeld (8.4) again. For

constitute a set of zero measure.

Vanishing of integral (8.14) for ˜r 6∈ Γ follows from rot m = 0,
this equality can be veriﬁed by direct calculations. Singular point

Theorem (on the circulation of magnetic ﬁeld). Circulation of

equal to total electric current penetrating this surface multiplied
by fraction 4 π/c.

Integral over the surface S now is in right hand side of formula
(8.16) explicitly. Therefore surface spanned over the contour Γ
now is ﬁxed. We cannot deform this surface as we did above
in proving theorem on circulation of electric ﬁeld. This leads to
some technical complication of the proof. Let’s consider ε-blow-
up of surface S. This is domain Ω(ε) being union of all ε-balls
surrounding all point r ∈ S. This domain encloses surface S and
contour Γ = ∂S. If ε → 0, domain Ω(ε) contracts to S.

Denote by D(ε) = R3 \ Ω(ε) exterior of the domain Ω(ε) and
then consider the following modiﬁcation of formula (5.6) that

which can be found in [1].

Lemma 8.1. Double layer potential (8.23) is restricted func-

tion in R3 \ S. At each inner point ˜r ∈ S there are side limits

V (r),

inner limit V−(˜r) as r tends to ˜r ∈ S from inside along normal
vector n, and outer limit V+(˜r) as r tends to ˜r ∈ S from outside
against the direction of normal vector n. Thereby V+ − V− = 4π
for all points ˜r ∈ S.

In order to calculate limit in formula (8.22) we need to study
the geometry of ε-blow-up of the surface S. On Fig. 8.2 below
we see cross-section of the domain Ω(ε) obtained from the surface
S shown on Fig. 8.1. For suﬃciently small ε boundary of the
domain Ω(ε) is composed of three parts:

§ 9. Diﬀerential equations

In § 8 we have derived four integral equations for electric and
magnetic ﬁelds. They are used to be grouped into two pairs.
Equations in ﬁrst pair have zero right hand sides:

Applying Ostrogradsky-Gauss formula and Stokes formula, one
can transform surface integrals to spatial ones, and contour inte-
grals to surface integrals. Then, since Ω is arbitrary domain and

42

CHAPTER I. ELECTROSTATICS AND MAGNETOSTATICS.

S is arbitrary open surface, integral equations (9.1) and (9.2) can
be transformed to diﬀerential equations:

div H = 0,

div E = 4πρ,

rot E = 0,

When considering diﬀerential equations (9.3) and (9.4), we should
add conditions for charges and currents being stationary:

(9.5)

∂ρ

∂j

= 0.

The relationship (7.1) then is a consequence of (9.5) and charge
conservation law.

Diﬀerential equations (9.3) and (9.4) form complete system
of diﬀerential equations for describing stationary electromagnetic
ﬁelds. When solving them functions ρ(r) and j(r) are assumed to
be known. If they are not known, one should have some additional
equations relating ρ and j with E and H. These additional
equations describe properties of medium (for instance, continuous
conducting medium is described by the equation j = σ E, where σ
is conductivity of medium).

CHAPTER II

CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS

§ 1. Maxwell equations.

Diﬀerential equations (9.3) and (9.4), which we have derived
in the end of Chapter I, describe ﬁelds generated by stationary
charges and currents. They are absolutely unsuitable if we are
going to describe the process of haw electromagnetic interaction is
transmitted in space. Note that the notion of ﬁeld was introduced
within framework of the concept of near action for describing
the object that transmit interaction of charges and currents. For
static ﬁelds this property is revealed in a very restrictive form,
i. e. we use ﬁelds only to divide interaction of charges and currents
into two processes: creation of a ﬁeld by charges and currents is
ﬁrst process, action of this ﬁeld upon other currents and charges
is second process. Dynamic properties of the ﬁeld itself appears
beyond our consideration.

More exact equations describing process of transmitting elec-
tromagnetic interaction in its time evolution were suggested by
Maxwell. They are the following ones:

div H = 0,

rot E = −

It is easy to see that equations (1.1) and (1.2) are generalizations

latter ones by modifying right hand sides. Like equations (9.3)

If imaginary contour
Γ = ∂S in space is replaced by real circular conductor, then
electric ﬁeld with nonzero circulation induces electric current in
conductor. The quantity e from (1.5) in this case is called electro-
motive force of the ﬁeld E in contour. Electromotive force e 6= 0

§ 1. MAXWELL EQUATIONS.

45

voltage e into this contour. Experimentally it reveals as follow:
alternating magnetic ﬁeld produces electric ﬁeld with nonzero cir-
culation, this induces electric current in circular conductor. This
phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction.
It was ﬁrst
discovered by Faraday. Faraday gave qualitative description of
this phenomenon in form of the following induction law.

Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. Electromo-
tive force of induction in circular conductor is proportional to the
rate of changing of magnetic ﬂow embraced by this conductor.

Faraday’s induction law was a hint for Maxwell when choosing
right hand side in second equation (1.1). As for similar term in
right hand side of second equation (1.2), Maxwell had written it
by analogy. Experiments and further development of technology
proved correctness of Maxwell equations.

Note that charge conservation law in form of relationship (5.4)
from Chapter I is a consequence of Maxwell equations. One
should calculate divergency of both sides of second equation (1.2):

div rot H =

div j +

then one should apply the identity div rot H = 0. When combined
with the ﬁrst equation (1.2) this yields exactly the relationship
(5.4) from Chapter I.

Equations (1.1) and (1.2) form complete system for describ-
ing arbitrary electromagnetic ﬁelds.
In solving them functions
ρ(r, t) and j(r, t) should be given, or they should be determined
from medium equations. Then each problem of electrodynam-
ics mathematically reduces to some boundary-value problem or
mixed initial-value/boundary-value problem for Maxwell equa-
tions optionally completed by medium equations. In this section

we consider only some very special ones among such problems.
Our main goal is to derive important mathematical consequences
from Maxwell equations and to interpret their physical nature.

§ 2. Density of energy and energy ﬂow
for electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Suppose that in bulk conductor we have a current with density
j, and suppose that this current is produced by the ﬂow of charged
particles with charge q. If ν is the number of such particles per
unit volume and if v is their velocity, then j = q ν v. Recall that
current density is a charge passing through unit area per unit
time (see § 5 in Chapter I).

The quantity ε in (2.5) is called density of energy of electromag-
netic ﬁeld. Vector S is known as density of energy ﬂow. It also
called Umov-Pointing vector. Under such interpretation of quan-
tities (2.5) the relationship (2.4) can be treated as the equation
of energy balance. First summand in (2.4) is called dissipation
power, this is the amount of energy dissipated per unit time at
the expense of transmitting it to moving charges. Second sum-
mand is the amount of energy that ﬂows from within domain Ω to

48

CHAPTER II. CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS.

outer space per unit time. These two forms of energy losses lead
to diminishing the energy stored by electromagnetic ﬁeld itself
within domain Ω (see third summand in (2.4)).

Energy balance equation (2.4) can be rewritten in diﬀerential

form, analogous to formula (5.4) from Chapter I:

energy then ﬂows to outer space through boundary of the domain

TV transmitters.
If we eliminate or restrict substantially the
energy leakage from the domain Ω to outer space, then we would
have the device like microwave oven, where electromagnetic ﬁeld
is used for transmitting energy from radiator to beefsteak.

Electromagnetic ﬁeld can store and transmit not only the
energy, but the momentum as well. In order to derive momentum
balance equations let’s consider again the current with density j
due to the particles with charge q which move with velocity v.
Let ν be concentration of these particles, i. e. number of particles
per unit volume. Then j = q ν v and ρ = q ν. Total force acting
on all particles within domain Ω is given by integral

for commutator, but here by square brackets we denote vector
product of two vectors. From second identity (2.11) we derive

loss of momentum stored in electromagnetic ﬁeld due to transmit-
ting it to moving particles. Second term in (2.18) determines loss
of momentum due to its ﬂow through the boundary of the domain
Ω. These two losses lead to diminishing the momentum stored
by electromagnetic ﬁeld within domain Ω (see third summand in
(2.18)).

The relationship (2.18) can be rewritten in diﬀerential form.
For this purpose we should deﬁne vectorial divergency for tensorial
ﬁeld σ of the type (1, 1). Let

(2.19)

µ = div σ, where µj =

It is also capable to transmit energy and momentum to material

abstraction convenient for describing interaction of charges and
currents, but real physical object.

the derivation of (2.12) and (2.13).

CHAPTER II. CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS.

§ 3. Vectorial and scalar potentials
of electromagnetic ﬁeld.

In section 2 we have found that electromagnetic ﬁeld possess
energy and momentum (2.21). This is very important conse-
quence of Maxwell equations (1.1) and (1.2). However we have
not studied Maxwell equations themselves. This is system of four
equations, two of them are scalar equations, other two are vecto-
rial equations. So they are equivalent to eight scalar equations.
However we have only six undetermined functions in them: three
components of vector E and three components of vector H. So
observe somewhat like excessiveness in Maxwell equations.

One of the most popular ways for solving systems of algebraic
equations is to express some variable through other ones by
solving one of the equations in a system (usually most simple
equation) and then substituting the expression obtained into other
equations. Thus we exclude one variable and diminish the number
of equations in a system also by one.
Sometimes this trick
is applicable to diﬀerential equations as well. Let’s consider
Maxwell equation div H = 0. Vector ﬁeld with zero divergency is
called vortex ﬁeld. For vortex ﬁelds the following theorem holds
(see proof in book [3]).

Theorem on vortex ﬁeld. Each vortex ﬁeld is a rotor of some

other vector ﬁeld.

Let’s write the statement of this theorem as applied to mag-

netic ﬁeld. It is given by the following relationship:

(3.1)

H = rot A.

Vector ﬁeld A, whose existence is granted by the above theorem,
is called vector-potential of electromagnetic ﬁeld.

§ 3. VECTORIAL AND SCALAR POTENTIALS . . .

Let’s substitute vector H as given by (3.1) into second Maxwell

equation (1.1). This yields the equality

Vector ﬁeld with zero rotor is called potential ﬁeld.
It is vector
ﬁeld E + (∂A/∂t)/c in formula (3.2) which is obviously potential
ﬁeld. Potential ﬁelds are described by the following theorem (see
proof in book [3]).

Theorem on potential ﬁeld. Each potential ﬁeld is a gradi-

ent of some scalar ﬁeld.

Applying this theorem to vector ﬁeld (3.2), we get the relation-

ship determining scalar potential of electromagnetic ﬁeld ϕ:

Diﬀerential equations (3.8) are Maxwell equations written in
terms of A and ϕ. This is system of two equations one of
which is scalar equation, while another is vectorial equation. As
we can see, number of equations now is equal to the number of
undetermined functions in them.

§ 4. Gauge transformations and Lorentzian gauge.

Vectorial and scalar potentials A and ϕ were introduced in
§ 3 as a replacement for electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and H.
However, ﬁelds A and ϕ are not physical ﬁelds. Physical ﬁelds
E and H are expressed through A and ϕ according to formulas
(3.4), but backward correspondence is not unique, i. e. ﬁelds A

§ 4. GAUGE TRANSFORMATIONS . . .

57

and ϕ are not uniquely determined by physical ﬁelds E and H.
Indeed, let’s consider transformation

(4.1)

˜A = A + grad ψ,

c

˜ϕ = ϕ −

∂ψ
∂t

,

where ψ(r, t) is an arbitrary function. Substituting (4.1) into
formula (3.4), we immediately get

˜E = E,

˜H = H.

This means that physical ﬁelds E, H determined by ﬁelds ˜A, ˜ϕ
and by ﬁelds A, ϕ do coincide. Transformation (4.1) that do not
change physical ﬁelds E and H is called gauge transformation.

We use gauge transformations (4.1) for further simpliﬁcation of
Maxwell equations (3.8). Let’s consider the quantity enclosed in
brackets in right hand sides of the equations (3.8):

Denote by (cid:3) the following diﬀerential operator:

Operator (4.3) is called d’Alambert operator or wave operator.
Diﬀerential equation (cid:3)u = v is called d’Alambert equation.

Using gauge freedom provided by gauge transformation (4.1),

we can fulﬁll the following condition:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

It is known that d’Alambert equation is solvable under rather
weak restrictions for its right hand side (see book [1]). Hence
practically always we can fulﬁll the condition (4.4). This condition
is called Lorentzian gauge.

If Lorentzian gauge condition (4.4) is fulﬁlled, then Maxwell

equations (3.8) simplify substantially:

(4.5)

(cid:3)ϕ = 4 π ρ,

(cid:3)A =

4 π j
c

.

They look like pair of independent d’Alambert equations. How-
ever, one shouldn’t think that variables A and ϕ are completely
separated. Lorentzian gauge condition (4.4) itself is an additional
equation requiring concordant choice of solutions for d’Alambert
equations (4.5).

D’Alambert operator (4.3) is a scalar operator, in (4.5) it acts
upon each component of vector A separately. Therefore operator
(cid:3) commutates with rotor operator and with time derivative as
well. Therefore on the base of (3.4) we derive

(cid:3)E = −4π grad ρ −

These equations (4.6) have no entries of potentials A and ϕ.
They are written in terms of real physical ﬁelds E and H, and
are consequences of Maxwell equations (1.1) and (1.2). However,
backward Maxwell equations do not follow from (4.6).

In previous Chapter we considered static electromagnetic ﬁelds.
Such ﬁelds are uniquely determined by static conﬁguration of
charges and currents (see formu-
las (3.5) and (5.6) in Chapter I ).
They cannot exist in the absence
of charges and currents. How-
ever, as we shall see just below,
Maxwell equations have nonzero
solutions even in the case of iden-
tically zero currents and charges
in the space. Let’s study one of
such solutions. We choose some
right-oriented rectangular Carte-
sian system of coordinates and
take some constant vector k directed along x-axis (see Fig. 5.1).
Then we choose another constant vector A0 directed along y-axis
and consider the following two functions:

Fig. 5.1

H0

(5.1)

A = A0 sin(k x − ω t),

ϕ = 0.

Here k = |k|. Suppose ρ = 0 and j = 0. Then, substituting (5.1)
into (4.4) and into Maxwell equations (4.5), we get

(5.2)

k2 = |k|2 =

ω
c

.

It is not diﬃcult to satisfy this condition (5.2). If it is fulﬁlled,
then corresponding potentials (5.1) describe plane electromag-
netic wave, ω being its frequency and k being its wave-vector,
which determines the direction of propagation of that plane wave.
Rewriting (5.1) in a little bit diﬀerent form

(5.3)

A = A0 sin(k(x − c t)),

60

CHAPTER II. CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS.

we see that the velocity of propagating of plane electromagnetic
wave is equal to constant c (see (1.5) in Chapter I).

Now let’s substitute (5.1) into (3.4) and calculate electric and

magnetic ﬁelds in electromagnetic wave:

E = E0 cos(k x − ω t),

E0 = |k| A0,

(5.4)

H = H0 cos(k x − ω t),

H0 = [k, A0],

|E0| = |H0| = |k| |A0|.

Vectors k, E0, and H0 are perpendicular to each other, they form
right triple. Wave (5.4) with such vectors is called plane linear
polarized electromagnetic wave. Vector E0 is taken for polarization
vector of this wave. Wave

E = E0 cos(k x − ω t) + H0 sin(k x − ω t),

H = H0 cos(k x − ω t) − E0 sin(k x − ω t)

is called circular polarized wave. It is superposition of two linear

has no ﬁxed polarization, however it is not circular polarized as
well. Natural light is a superposition of numerous plane linear
polarized waves with chaotically distributed polarization vectors.

§ 6. Emission of electromagnetic waves.

Plane wave (5.4) is an endless wave ﬁlling the whole space. It
is certainly kind of idealization. Real electromagnetic waves ﬁll
only some restricted part of the space. Moreover, they are not
eternal in time: there are sources (radiators) and absorbers of
electromagnetic ﬁelds. Formula (5.4) is an approximate descrip-
tion of real electromagnetic ﬁeld in that part of space which is far
apart from radiators and absorbers.

§ 6. EMISSION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES.

61

In this section we consider process of generation and radiation
of electromagnetic waves. Usually radiator is a system of charges
and currents, which is not static. We describe it by means of
functions ρ(r, t) and j(r, t). Let’s consider Maxwell equations
transformed to the form (4.5). These are non-homogeneous diﬀer-
ential equations. Their solutions are not unique: to each solution
already found one can add arbitrary solution of corresponding
homogeneous equations. However, if we assume ρ(r, t) and j(r, t)
to be fast decreasing as r → ∞ and apply similar condition to
ϕ(r, t) and A(r, t), then we restrict substantially the freedom in
choosing solutions of the equations (4.5).
In order to ﬁnd one
of such solutions we need fundamental solution of d’Alambert
operator. This is distribution of the form:

(6.1)

u(r, t) =

θ(t) δ(c2t2 − |r|2),

c
2π

where θ and δ are Heaviside theta-function and Dirac delta-
function respectively. Function (6.1) satisﬁes d’Alambert equation
with distribution in right hand side:

(cid:3)u = δ(t)δ(r).

In physics such objects are called Green functions. Knowing
fundamental solution (6.1) of d’Alambert operator, now we can
write solution for the equations (4.5) in form of contractions:

(6.2)

ϕ = 4π u ∗ ρ,

A =

u ∗ j.

4π
c

Here ∗ denotes contraction of two distributions, see [1]. Due to
the properties of this operation from charge conservation law (see
formula (5.4) in Chapter I) we derive Lorentzian gauge condition
(4.4) for scalar and vectorial potentials (6.2). For smooth and

62

CHAPTER II. CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS.

suﬃciently fast decreasing functions ρ(r, t) and j(r, t) potentials
(6.2) are reduced to the following two integrals:

(6.3)

ϕ(r, t) =

A(r, t) =

ρ(˜r, t − τ )
|r − ˜r|

d3˜r,

j(˜r, t − τ )
c |r − ˜r|

d3˜r.

Z

Z

Here the quantity τ = τ (r, ˜r) is called time delay. It is determined
by the ratio τ = |r − ˜r|/c. Potentials (6.3) are called retarded
potentials.

Retarded potentials have transparent physical interpretation.
Scalar potential ϕ at the point r at time instant t is a superposi-
tion of contributions from charges at various points of the space,
the contribution from the point ˜r being determined not by charge
density at present time instant t, but at previous time instant
t − τ . Time delay τ is exactly equal to the time required for the
signal spreading with light velocity c from the source point ˜r to
get to the observation point r. Similar time delay is present in
formula for vector potential A.

Note that fundamental solution of d’Alambert equation is not
unique. For example there is a solution obtained from (6.1)
by changing τ for −τ . Such solution corresponds to advanced
potentials. However,
in physics advanced potentials have no
meaning, since they would break causality principle.

Let’s consider system of charges located in some small domain
linear size of
Ω surrounding the origin.
this domain Ω. Using formulas (6.3), we calculate we calculate
electromagnetic ﬁeld of the system of charges at the point r which
is far distant from the domain Ω, i. e. |˜r| ≤ R ≪ |r|. Due to these
inequalities the ratio ˜r/|r| is small vectorial quantity. Therefore

Let R be maximal

(6.6)

The ratio |r|/c in (6.4) determines the time required for electro-
magnetic signal to get from the domain Ω to the observation point
|r|. Posterior terms in the series for t − τ are estimated by small
quantity R/c. This is the time of propagation of electromagnetic
signal within domain Ω.

Denote t′ = t − |r|/c and let t − τ = t′ + θ. For the quantity θ
we have the estimate |θ| ≤ R/c. Then let’s consider the following
Taylor expansions for ρ and j:

ρ(˜r, t − τ ) = ρ(˜r, t′) +

θ + . . . ,

j(˜r, t − τ ) = j(˜r, t′) +

θ + . . . .

∂ρ(˜r, t′)

The condition R ≪ |r| is not suﬃcient for the expansions (6.5) to
be consistent. Use of expansions (6.5) for approximating ρ(˜r, t−τ )
and j(˜r, t − τ ) is possible only under some additional assumptions
concerning these functions. Denote by T some speciﬁc time for
which functions ρ and j within domain Ω change substantially. In
case when one can specify such time T , the following quantities
are of the same order, i. e. equally large or equally small:

Now (6.5) can be rewritten as follows:

Correctness of use of expansions (6.7) and (6.5) is provided by
additional condition R/c ≪ T . This yields θ/T ≪ 1.
The condition R/c ≪ T has simple meaning:

the quantity
ω = 2π/T is a frequency of radiated electromagnetic waves, while
λ = 2πc/ω = c T is a wavelength. Hence condition R/c ≪ T
means that wavelength is mach greater than the size of radiator.
Suppose that both conditions R ≪ c T and R ≪ |r| are fulﬁlled.
Let’s calculate retarded vector potential A in (6.3) keeping only

The estimate R/(c T ) ≪ 1 following from R ≪ c T means that

Potentials (6.10) and (6.13) are retarded potentials of the
system of charges in dipole approximation. Dependence of ρ and j
on time variable t lead to the dependence of D on t′ in them. Let’s

Vectors E and H (more precisely, leading terms in their asymp-
totics) are perpendicular to each other and both are perpendicular
to vector r. This situation is similar to that of plane wave. How-
ever, in present case we deal with spherical wave being radiated
from the origin. The magnitude of ﬁelds |E| ≃ |H| decreases as
1/|r|, which is slower than for static Coulomb ﬁeld. Using formula
(2.5), one can ﬁnd the density of energy ﬂow for waves (6.15):

§ 6. EMISSION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES.

For modulus of vector S we have |S| ∼ 1/|r|2. This means that
total ﬂow of energy through the sphere of arbitrarily large sphere
is nonzero. So we have real radiation of electromagnetic energy.
The amount of radiated energy is determined by second time
derivative of dipole moment. Therefore this case is called dipole
approximation in theory of radiation.

Exercise 6.1. Applying formula (6.16), ﬁnd angular distribu-
tion of the intensity for dipole radiation. Also ﬁnd total intensity
of dipole radiation.

Exercise 6.2. Particle with charge q is moving along circular
path of radius R with constant velocity v = ωR for inﬁnitely long
time (ω is angular velocity). Calculate retarding potentials and
ﬁnd angular distribution for intensity of electromagnetic radiation
of this particle. Also ﬁnd total intensity of such cyclotronic radia-
tion.

Exercise 6.3. Assume that charge density ρ is zero, while cur-

rent density j is given by the following distribution:

(compare with (7.16) in Chapter I). Find retarding potentials (6.2)
for (6.17). Also ﬁnd angular distribution and total intensity for
magnetic-dipole radiation induced by current (6.17).

CHAPTER III

SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

§ 1. Galileo transformations.

Classical electrodynamics based on Maxwell equations histor-
ically was ﬁrst ﬁeld theory.
It explained all electromagnetic
phenomena and predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves.
Later on electromagnetic waves were detected experimentally and
nowadays they have broad scope of applications in our everyday
life. However, along with successful development of this theory,
some diﬃculties there appeared. It was found that classical elec-
trodynamics contradicts to relativity principle. This principle in
its classical form suggested by Galileo and Newton states that
two Cartesian inertial coordinate systems moving with constant
velocity with respect to each other are equivalent. All physi-
cal phenomena in these two systems happen identically and are
described by the same laws.

Let’s consider two such Cartesian inertial coordinate systems
(r, t) and (˜r, ˜t). Suppose that second system moves with velocity
u relative to ﬁrst one so that coordinate axes in motion remain
parallel to their initial positions. The relation of radius-vectors of
points then can be written in form of the following transforma-
tions known as Galileo transformations:

(1.1)

t = ˜t,

r = ˜r + u˜t.

§ 1. GALILEO TRANSFORMATIONS.

69

First relationship (1.1) means that watches in two systems are
synchronized and tick synchronously. Let ˜r(˜t) be trajectory of
some material point in coordinate system (˜r, ˜t).
In ﬁrst coordi-
nate system this trajectory is given by vector r(t) = ˜r(˜t) + u˜t.
Diﬀerentiating this relationship, due to ˜t = t in (1.1) we get

(1.2)

∂r
∂t

=

+ u,

∂˜r
∂˜t

v = ˜v + u.

Last relationship in (1.2) is known as classical law of velocity
addition. Diﬀerentiating (1.2) once more, we ﬁnd the relation for
accelerations of material point in these two coordinate systems:

(1.3)

∂2r
∂t2 =

∂2˜r
∂˜t2

,

a = ˜a.

According to Newton’s second law, acceleration of material point
is determined by force F acting on it and by its mass m a = F.
From (1.3) due to relativity principle we conclude that force F
is invariant quantity. It doesn’t depend on the choice of inertial
coordinate system. This fact is represented by the relationship

(1.4)

F(˜r + u˜t, ˜v + u) = ˜F(˜r, ˜v).

Now let’s consider charged particle with charge q being at
rest in coordinate system (˜r, ˜t).
In this coordinate system it
produces Coulomb electrostatic ﬁeld. In coordinate system (r, t)
this particle is moving. Hence it should produce electric ﬁeld and
magnetic ﬁeld as well. This indicate that vectors E and H are
not invariant under Galileo transformations (1.1). Even if in one
coordinate system we have pure electric ﬁeld, in second system we
should expect the presence of both electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

70

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Therefore transformation rules for E and H analogous to (1.4) for
F should be written in the following form:

E(˜r + u˜t, ˜t) = α( ˜E(˜r, ˜t), ˜H(˜r, ˜t), u),
H(˜r + u˜t, ˜t) = β( ˜E(˜r, ˜t), ˜H(˜r, ˜t), u).

Due to superposition principle, which is fulﬁlled in both coordi-
nate systems, functions α and β are linear and homogeneous with
respect to ˜E and ˜H. Therefore (1.5) is rewritten as

E(r, t) = α1 ˜E(˜r, ˜t) + α2 ˜H(˜r, ˜t),
H(r, t) = β1 ˜E(˜r, ˜t) + β2 ˜H(˜r, ˜t),

where α1, α2, β1, β2 are some linear operators which depend on
u only. Vectors E and H determine the action of electromagnetic
ﬁeld upon charges in form of Lorentz force (see formula (4.4) in
Chapter I). Substituting (1.6) into that formula and taking into
account (1.2) and (1.4), we get

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.7)

qα1 ˜E + qα2 ˜H +

+

[˜v + u, β2 ˜H] = q ˜E +

q

[˜v + u, β1 ˜E]+

[˜v, ˜H].

The relationship (1.7) is an identity with three arbitrary parame-
ters: ˜v, ˜E, ˜H. Therefore we can equate separately terms bilinear
with respect to ˜v and ˜E. This yields [˜v, β1 ˜E] = 0, hence β1 = 0.
Now let’s equate terms bilinear with respect to ˜v and ˜H. This
yields [˜v, β2 ˜H] = [˜v, ˜H]. Hence β2 = 1. And ﬁnally we should
equate terms linear with respect to ˜H and ˜E. This yields the
following formulas for operators α1 and α2:

α2 ˜H = −

α1 = 1.

CopyRight c(cid:13) Sharipov R.A., 1997, 2003.

§ 1. GALILEO TRANSFORMATIONS.

71

Now, if we substitute the above expressions for operators α1, α2,
β1, β2 into formula (1.6), we get the relationships

(1.8)

E = ˜E −

[u, ˜H],

H = ˜H.

The relationships (1.8) should complete Galileo transforma-
tions (1.1) in electrodynamics. However, as we shall see just
below, they cannot do this mission in non-contradictory form.
For this purpose, let’s transform Maxwell equations written as
(1.1) and (1.2) in Chapter II to coordinate system (˜r, ˜t). For
partial derivatives due to transformations (1.1) we have

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

When substituting the above expressions into Maxwell equa-
tions we consider the case of zero charges and currents: ρ = 0,
j = 0. This yields the following equations:

Only two of the above four equations coincide with original
Maxwell equations. Other two equations contain the entries
of vector u that cannot be eliminated.

This circumstance that we have found is very important. In the
end of XIX-th century it made a dilemma for physicists. The way
how this dilemma was resolved had determined in most further
development of physics in XX-th century.
Indeed, one had to
make the following crucial choice:

(1) to admit that Maxwell equations are not invariant with
respect to Galileo transformations, hence they require the
existence of some marked inertial coordinate system where
they have standard form given in the very beginning of
Chapter II;

(2) or to assume that formulas (1.1) are not correct, hence
relativity principle claiming equivalence of all inertial co-
ordinate systems is realized in some diﬀerent way.

§ 2. LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS.

73

First Choice had lead to ether theory. According to this theory,
marked inertial coordinate system is bound to some hypothetical
matter, which was called ether. This matter has no mass, no
color, and no smell. It ﬁlls the whole space and does not reveal
itself otherwise, but as a carrier of electromagnetic interaction.
Speciﬁed properties of ether look quite unusual, this makes ether
theory too artiﬁcial (not natural). As a compromise this theory
was admitted for a while, but later was refuted by experiments of
Michaelson and Morley, who tried to measure the Earth velocity
relative to ether (ether wind).

Second choice is more crucial. Indeed, refusing formulas (1.1),
we refuse classical mechanics of Newton in whole. Nevertheless
the development of science went through this second choice.

§ 2. Lorentz transformations.

Having refused formulas (1.1), one should replace them by
something else. This was done by Lorentz. Following Lorentz,
now we replace Galileo transformations (1.1) by general linear
transformations relating (r, t) and (˜r, ˜t):

(2.1)

c t = S0

0 c ˜t +

S0
k ˜rk,

ri = Si

0 c ˜t +

k ˜rk.
Si

3

Xk=1

3

Xk=1

In (2.1) we introduced c as a factor for time variables t and ˜t in
order to equalize measure units. Upon introducing this factor all
components of matrix S appear to be purely numeric quantities
that do not require measure units at all. It is convenient to denote
c t by r0 and treat this quantity as additional (fourth) component
of radius-vector:

(2.2)

r0 = ct.

74

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Then two relationships (2.1) can be united into one relationship:

(2.3)

ri =

k ˜rk.
Si

In order to have invertible transformation (2.3) one should assume
that det S 6= 0. Let T = S−1. Then inverse transformation for
(2.3) is written as follows:

(2.4)

˜ri =

k rk.
T i

3

Xk=0

3

Xk=0

By their structure transformation (2.3) and (2.4) coincide with
transformations of coordinates of four-dimensional vector under
the change of base. Soon we shall see that such interpretation
appears to be very fruitful.

Now the problem of deriving Lorentz transformations can be
formulated as problem of ﬁnding components of matrix S in (2.3).
The only condition we should satisfy thereby is the invariance
of Maxwell equations with respect to transformations (2.3) upon
completing them with transformations for ρ, j, E and H.

For the beginning let’s consider the case with no currents and
charges, i. e. the case ρ = 0, j = 0. Instead of Maxwell equations
let’s study their diﬀerential consequences written in form of the
equations (4.6) in Chapter II:

(2.5)

(cid:3)E = 0,

(cid:3)H = 0.

Invariance of (2.5) under the transformations (2.3) and (2.4) is
necessary (but possibly not suﬃcient) condition for invariance of
Maxwell equations from which the equations (2.5) were derived.

§ 2. LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS.

used in the above equations (2.5):

It is easy to see that inverse matrix gij for (2.7) has the same
components, i. e. gij = gij.

From (2.3) and (2.4) we derive the following transformation

rules for ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators:

Theorem 2.1. For any choice of operator coeﬃcients α1, α2,
β1, and β2 in formulas (1.6) the invariance of the form of equations
(2.5) under the transformations (2.3) and (2.4) is equivalent to
proportionality of matrices g and ˜g, i. e.

(2.11)

˜gij = λ gij.

Numeric factor λ in formula (2.11) is usually chosen to be equal

to unity: λ = 1. In this case from (2.10) and (2.11) we derive

(2.12)

Here g is a matrix of the form (2.7), while by T t in (2.13) we
denote transposed matrix T .

Deﬁnition 2.1. Matrix T satisfying the relationship (2.13) is

called Lorentzian matrix.

It is easy to check up that the set of Lorentzian matrices form

§ 3. MINKOWSKY SPACE.

77

From the relationship (2.13) for Lorentzian matrix we derive
the equality (det T )2 = 1. Hence det T = ±1. Lorentzian matrices
with unit determinant form the group SO(1, 3), it is called special
matrix Lorentz group.
If i = j = 0,

from (2.12) we obtain the following formula

relating components of Lorentzian matrix T :

is called orthochronous. The set of orthochronous Lorentzian ma-
trices form orthochronous matrix Lorentz group O+(1, 3). Intersec-
tion SO+(1, 3) = SO(1, 3)∩O+(1, 3) is called special orthochronous
matrix Lorentz group.

introduced notations (2.2) and united space and time into one
four-dimensional “space-time”. Let’s denote it by M . Four-
dimensional space M is basic object in special theory of relativity.
Its points are called events. The space of events is equipped with
quadratic form g with signature (1, 3). This quadratic form is
called Minkowsky metric. Thereby inertial coordinate systems are
interpreted as Cartesian coordinates for which Minkowsky metric
has canonical form (2.7).

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Equivalence principle. All physical laws in any two inertial

coordinate systems are written in the same form.

Let’s choose some inertial coordinate system. This choice
determines separation of event space M into geometric space V
(space of points) and time axis T :

(3.1)

M = T ⊕ V.

Matrix of Minkowsky metric in chosen coordinate system has
canonic form (2.7). Therefore geometric space V is orthogonal to
time axis T with respect to Minkowsky metric g. Restriction of
this metric to V is negative quadratic form. Changing its sign,
we get positive quadratic form. This is standard Euclidean scalar
product in V .

Now let’s consider another inertial coordinate system. Like

(3.1), it determines second expansion of M into space and time:

(3.2)

M = ˜T ⊕ ˜V .

In general time axes T and ˜T in expansions (3.1) and (3.2) do
not coincide. Indeed, bases of these two coordinate systems are
related to each other by formula

§ 3. MINKOWSKY SPACE.

79

Non-coincidence of time axes T 6= ˜T for two inertial coordinate
systems leads to non-coincidence of geometric spaces: V 6= ˜V .
This fact lead to quite radical conclusion when we interpret
it physically: observers in two such inertial systems observe two
diﬀerent three-dimensional geometric spaces and have two diﬀerent
time ticks. However, in our everyday life this diﬀerence is very
small and never reveals.

Let’s calculate how big is the diﬀerence in the rate of time ticks

for two inertial coordinate systems. From (2.4) we get

Let t → +∞.

If matrix T is not orthochronous, then
t → +∞ we get ˜t → −∞. Transformations (2.4) with non-
orthochronous matrices T invert the direction of time exchanging
the future and the past. It would be very intriguing to have such
a feature in theory. However, presently in constructing theory of
relativity one uses more realistic approach. So we shall assume
that two physically real inertial coordinate systems can be related
only by orthochronous Lorentz matrices from O+(1, 3).

Restriction of the set of admissible Lorentz matrices from
O(1, 3) to O+(1, 3) is due to the presence of additional structure
in the space of events. It is called polarization. Let’s choose some
physical inertial coordinate system. Minkowsky metric in such
system is given by matrix of canonical form (2.7). Let’s calculate
scalar square of four-dimensional vector x in Minkowsky metric:

(3.6)

g(x, x) = (x0)2 − (x1)2 − (x2)2 − (x3)2.

By value of their scalar square g(x, x) in Minkowsky metric g

vectors of Minkowsky space M are subdivided into three parts:

(1) tome-like vectors, for which g(x, x) is positive;
(2) light vectors, for which g(x, x) = 0;
(3) space-like vectors, for which g(x, x) is negative.

Coordinates of light vectors satisfy the following equation:

(3.7)

(x0)2 − (x1)2 − (x2)2 − (x3)2 = 0.

It is easy to see that (3.7) is the equation of cone in four-
dimensional space (see classiﬁcation of quadrics in [4]). This cone
(3.7) is called light cone.

Time-like vectors ﬁll interior of
light cone, while space-like vectors
ﬁll outer space outside this cone.
Interior of light cone is a union of
two parts:
time-like vectors with
x0 > 0 are directed to the future,
others with x0 < 0 are directed to
the past. Vector directed to the
future can be continuously trans-
formed to any other vector directed
to the future. However, it cannot
be continuously transformed to a
vector directed to the past without
making it space-like vector or zero vector at least once during
transformation. This means that the set of time-like vectors is
disjoint union of two connected components.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Geometric structure in Minkowsky space M
that marks one of two connected components in the set of time-
like vectors is called polarization.
It is used to say that marked
component points to the future.

Let e0, e1, e2, e3 be orthonormal base in Minkowsky metric*.
In the space M with polarization one can consider only those
such bases for which unit vector of time axis e0 is directed to the
future. Then transition from one of such bases to another would
be given by orthochronous matrix from group O+(1, 3).

Deﬁnition 3.2. Four-dimensional aﬃne space M equipped
with metric g of signature (1, 3) and equipped with orientation**
and polarization is called Minkowsky space.

According to special theory of relativity Minkowsky space,
which is equipped with orientation and polarization, is proper
mathematical model for the space of real physical events. Now
we can give strict mathematical deﬁnition of inertial coordinate
system.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Orthonormal right inertial coordinate system
is orthonormal right coordinate system in Minkowsky space with
time base vector directed to the future.

It is easy to verify that any two inertial coordinate systems as
deﬁned above are related to each other by Lorentz transforma-
tion with matrix S from orthochronous Lorentz group SO+(1, 3).
Let’s choose one of such coordinate systems and consider related

everyday life possesses orientation distinguishing left and right.

§ 4. Kinematics of relative motion.

Galileo transformations are used in mechanics for describing
physical processes as they are seen by two observers representing
two inertial coordinate systems. Lorentz transformations, which
we have derived from the condition of invariance of electrodynam-
ical equations (2.5), are designed for the same purpose. However,
this is not immediately clear when looking at formulas (2.3) and
(2.4). Therefore we shall bring these formulas to the form more
convenient for studying their physical nature.

Let’s ﬁx two inertial coordinate systems related by Lorentz
transformation (2.1). First one is related with orthonormal base
e0, e1, e2, e3 in Minkowsky space and with the expansion (3.1).
Second is related with the base ˜e0, ˜e1, ˜e2, ˜e3 and with the
expansion (3.2). If time axes are parallel e0 = ˜e0, then Lorentz
matrix S in (2.3) is reduced to orthogonal matrix O ∈ SO(3)
relating two right orthonormal bases e1, e2, e3 and ˜e1, ˜e2, ˜e3. It
has the following blockwise-diagonal shape:

Thus, in case if T k ˜T two inertial coordinate systems diﬀer only
in directions of spatial axes. They do not move with respect to
each other.

Now let’s consider the case T ∦ ˜T . Hence e0 6= ˜e0. Let H be
linear span of vectors e0 and ˜e0. Denote by W intersection of
subspaces V and ˜V from (3.1) and (3.2):

(4.2)

H = Span(e0, ˜e0),

W = V ∩ ˜V .

§ 4. KINEMATICS OF RELATIVE MOTION.

Lemma 4.1. Two-dimensional subspaces H and W in (4.2) are
perpendicular to each other in Minkowsky metric g. Their inter-
section is zero: H ∩ W = {0}, while direct sum of these subspaces
coincides with the whole Minkowsky space: H ⊕ W = M .

Proof. Subspace H is two-dimensional since it is linear span
Subspaces V and ˜V are three-
of two non-collinear vectors.
dimensional and V 6= ˜V . Hence their sum V + ˜V coincides with
M , i. e. dim(V + ˜V ) = 4. Applying theorem on the dimension of
sum and intersection of two subspaces (see [4]), we get

dim(W ) = dim V + dim ˜V − dim(V + ˜V ) = 3 + 3 − 4 = 2.

In order to prove orthogonality of H and W we use orthogonal-
ity of T and V in the expansion (3.1) and orthogonality of ˜T and
˜V in (3.2). Let y be an arbitrary vector in subspace W . Then
y ∈ V . From V ⊥ T we get y ⊥ e0. Analogously from y ∈ ˜V we
get y ⊥ ˜e0. Now from orthogonality of y to both vectors e0 and
˜e0 we derive orthogonality of y to their linear span: y ⊥ H. Since
y is arbitrary vector in W , we have W ⊥ H.

Now let’s prove that H ∩ W = {0}. Let’s consider an arbitrary
vector x ∈ H ∩ W . From x ∈ H and x ∈ W due to orthogonality
of H and W , which is already proved, we get g(x, x) = 0. But
x ∈ W ⊂ V , while restriction of Minkowsky metric to subspace
V is negative quadratic form of signature (0, 3). Therefore from
g(x, x) = 0 we derive x = 0. Proposition H ∩ W = {0} is proved.
From H ∩ W = {0} we conclude that sum of subspaces H and
W is direct sum and dim(H +W ) = 2+2 = 4. Hence H ⊕W = M .
Lemma is proved. (cid:3)

Now let’s return back to considering pair of inertial coordinate
systems with bases e0, e1, e2, e3 and ˜e0, ˜e1, ˜e2, ˜e3. There is the
expansion (3.4) for vector ˜e0. Let’s write it as follows:

(4.3)

˜e0 = S0

0 e0 + v.

84

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Here v = S1

thochronous and since ˜e0 6= e0, we have

0 e2 + S3

0 e1 + S2

Since matrix S is or-

(4.4)

S0

0 > 1,

v 6= 0.

For any real number a > 1 there exists a number α > 0 such that
a = cosh(α). Let’s apply this observation to S0

0 in (4.3):

(4.5)

S0

0 = cosh(α).

From (4.3), from (4.5), and from orthogonality of vectors e0 and
v in Minkowsky metric we obtain

1 = g(˜e0, ˜e0) = (S0

0 )2 g(e0, e0) + g(v, v) = cosh2(α) − |v|2.

Using this equality we can ﬁnd Euclidean length of vector v in
three-dimensional subspace V :

(4.6)

|v| = sinh(α), where α > 0.

Let’s replace vector v by vector of unit length h1 = v/|v| and
rewrite the relationship (4.3) as follows:

(4.7)

˜e0 = cosh(α) e0 + sinh(α) h1.

Due to (4.7) vector h1 is linear combination of vectors e0 and ˜e0,
hence h1 ∈ H. But h1 ∈ V as well. Therefore h1 ∈ V ∩H. Vectors
e0 and h1 are perpendicular to each other, they form orthonormal
base in two-dimensional subspace H:

(4.8)

g(e0, e0) = 1,

g(h1, h1) = −1.

From (4.8) we conclude that restriction of Minkowsky metric to
subspace H is metric with signature (1, 1).

§ 4. KINEMATICS OF RELATIVE MOTION.

85

Now we need another vector from subspace H. Let’s determine

it by the following relationship:

(4.9)

˜h1 = sinh(α) e0 + cosh(α) h1.

It is easy to check that vectors ˜e0 and ˜h1 form another orthonor-
mal base in subspace H. Transition matrix relating these two
bases has the following form:

(4.10)

SL =

cosh(α)

sinh(α)

 

sinh(α)

cosh(α) !

.

Matrix (4.10) is called the matrix of Lorentzian rotation.
There is four-dimensional version of matrix (4.10).

Indeed,
vector h1 ∈ V is perpendicular to subspace W ⊂ V . Therefore we
have the expansion of subspace V as a direct sum:

V = Span(h1) ⊕ W.

Let’s choose two vectors h2 and h3 forming orthonormal base
in subspace W and complementing h1 up to an orthonormal
right base in V . Then four vectors e0, h1, h2 h3 constitute
orthonormal right base in M with time vector e0 directed to
the future. Transition matrix relating this base with the base
˜e0, ˜h1, h2 h3 has the following blockwise-diagonal form:

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Transition from base e0, e1, e2 e3 to base e0, h1, h2 h3 is given
by a matrix of the form (4.1). This is because their time vectors
do coincide. In a similar way transition from base ˜e0, ˜h1, h2 h3
to base ˜e0, ˜e1, ˜e2 ˜e3 is given by a matrix of the same form
(4.1). Ultimate change of base e0, e1, e2 e3 for another base
˜e0, ˜e1, ˜e2 ˜e3 then can be done in three steps.

Theorem 4.1. Each Lorentzian matrix S ∈ SO+(1, 3) is a
product of three matrices S = S1 SL S2, one of which SL is a
matrix of Lorentzian rotation (4.11), while two others S1 and S2
are matrices of the form (4.1).

In order to clarify physical meaning of Lorentz transformations
let’s ﬁrst consider transformations with matrix S of the form
(4.11). Let ct = r0, r1, r2, r3 be coordinates of some vector
r ∈ M in the base e0, h1, h2, h3. By c˜t = ˜r0, ˜r1, ˜r2, ˜r3 we denote
coordinates of the same vector in the base ˜e0, ˜h1, h2 h3. For
matrix S of the form (4.11) formula (2.3) leads to relationships

(4.12)

sinh(α)
c

˜r1,

r1 = sinh(α) c ˜t + cosh(α) ˜r1,
r2 = ˜r2,
r3 = ˜r3.

Let ˜r1, ˜r2, ˜r3 be coordinates of radius-vector of some point A
which is at rest in inertial coordinate system with base ˜e1, ˜e2, ˜e3.
Then ˜r1, ˜r2, ˜r3 are constants, they do not depend on time ˜t in
this coordinate system. Upon calculating coordinates of this point
A in other inertial coordinate system by means of formulas (4.12)
its ﬁrst coordinate r1 appears to be a function of parameter ˜t.
We use ﬁrst relationship (4.12) in order to express parameter ˜t

through time variable t in second coordinate system:

Substituting (4.13) into other three formulas (4.12), we get

˜r1.

r1 = r1(t) = c tanh(α) t + const,
r2 = r2(t) = const,
r3 = r3(t) = const .

From (4.14) we see that in second coordinate system our point A
is moving with constant velocity u = c tanh(α) in the direction of
ﬁrst coordinate axis.

In contrast to parameter α in matrix (4.11), parameter u
has transparent physical interpretation as magnitude of relative
velocity of one coordinate system with respect to another. Let’s
express components of matrix (4.11) through u:

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Denote for a while by r and ˜r the following two three-

dimensional vectors in subspaces V and ˜V :

(4.16)

r = r1 h1 + r2 h2 + r3 h3,
˜r = ˜r1 ˜h1 + ˜r2 h2 + ˜r3 h3.

Then we deﬁne linear map θ : V → ˜V determined by its action
upon base vectors h1, h2, and h3:

θ(h1) = ˜h1,

θ(h2) = h2,

θ(h3) = h3.

This map θ is orientation preserving isometry, since it maps right
orthonormal base of subspace V to right orthonormal base in
subspace ˜V . Using above notations (4.16) and the map θ, we can
write formulas (4.15) in vectorial form:

Here u = u h1 is vector of relative velocity of second coordinate
system with respect to ﬁrst one. Formulas (4.17) are irrespective
to the choice of bases in subspaces V and ˜V . Therefore they are
applicable to Lorentz transformations with special matrix of the
form (4.11) and to arbitrary Lorentz transformations with matrix
S = S1 SL S2 (see theorem 4.1).

Formulas (4.18) represent “conditionally three-dimensional” un-
derstanding of Lorentz transformations when vectors r and ˜r
treated as vectors of the same three-dimensional Euclidean space,
while t and ˜t are treated as scalar parameters. However, accord-
ing to modern paradigm four-dimensional Minkowsky space is real
physical entity, not purely mathematical abstraction convenient
for shortening formulas (compare (2.3) and (4.17)).

When writing formulas (4.17) and (4.18) in components we
should expand vectors r and u in the base of one coordinate sys-
tem, while vector ˜r is expanded in the base of another coordinate
system. Thereby the diﬀerence in the shape of these two formulas
completely disappears.

Exercise 4.1. Using expansions (4.16) for vectors r and ˜r, de-

rive the following formulas:

Combining these formulas with (4.15), derive formulas (4.17).

§ 5. Relativistic law of velocity addition.

Classical law of velocity addition was ﬁrst consequence that we

obtained from Galileo transformations:

(5.1)

v = ˜v + u,

see formulas (1.2). Replacing Galileo transformations by Lorentz
transformations, now we should derive new relativistic law of
velocity addition.

Suppose that vector-function ˜r(˜t) describes the motion of a
point A in inertial coordinate system (˜r, ˜t) and suppose that this
coordinate system moves with velocity u with respect to other
inertial coordinate system (r, t). For passing to coordinate system
(r, t) we use Lorentz transformation given by formulas (4.18). As
a result we get two functions

In a similar way by v we denote the velocity of this point in other
coordinates (r, t). To calculate v we divide derivatives:

Formula (5.5) is relativistic law of velocity addition. It is mach
more complicated than classical law given by formula (5.1). How-
ever, in the limit of small velocities |u| ≪ c formula (5.5) reduces
to formula (5.1).

Exercise 5.1. Derive relativistic law of velocity addition from

formula (4.17). Explain why resulting formula diﬀers from (5.5).

§ 6. World lines and private time.

Motion of point-size material object in arbitrary inertial coor-
dinate system (r, t) is described by vector-function r(t), where t

92

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

is time variable and r is radius-vector of point. Four-dimensional
radius-vector of this material point has the following components:

(6.1)

r0(t) = ct, r1(t), r2(t), r3(t).

Vector-function with components (6.1) determines parametric line
in Minkowsky space M , this line is called world line of material
point. Once world line is given, motion of material point is
described completely. Let’s diﬀerentiate four-dimensional radius-
vector (6.1) with respect to parameter t. As a result we get
four-dimensional vector tangent to world line:

(6.2)

K = (c, ˙r1, ˙r2, ˙r3) = (c, v1, v2, v3).

Last three components of this vector form velocity vector of
material point. Velocity of most material objects is not greater
|v| < c. When applied to vector K in (6.2)
than light velocity:
this means that tangent-vector of world line is time-like vector:

(6.3)

g(K, K) = c2 − |v|2 > 0.

Deﬁnition 6.1. Smooth curve in Minkowsky space is called
time-like curve if tangent-vector of this curve is time-like vector
at each its point.

World lines for most material objects are time-like curves.
Exception are world lines of photons (light particles) and world
lines of other elementary particles with zero mass. For them
|v| = c, hence we get g(K, K) = 0.

World line have no singular points. Indeed, even if g(K, K) =

0, tangent vector K in (6.2) is nonzero since K 0 = c 6= 0.

Let’s consider world line of material point of nonzero mass.

§ 6. WORLD LINES AND PRIVATE TIME.

93

For this line we have the condition (6.3) fulﬁlled, hence we can
introduce natural parameter on this line:

(6.4)

s(t) =

g(K, K) dt.

Zt0 p

Integral (6.4) yields invariant parameter for world lines. For any
two points A and B on a given world line the quantity s(B)−s(A)
does not depend on inertial coordinate system used for calculating
integral (6.4). This quantity is called interval length of the arc
AB on world line.

Theorem 6.1. Straight line segment connecting end points of
an arc on smooth time-like curve is a segment of time-like straight
line.
Its interval length is greater than interval length of corre-
sponding arc.

Let A and B be two successive events in the “life” of material
point of nonzero mass. The answer to the question what time in-
terval separates these two events depend on the choice of inertial
coordinate system from which we observe the “life” of this ma-
terial point. So this answer is relative (not invariant). However,
there is invariant quantity characterizing time distance between
two events on world line:

(6.5)

τ =

s(B) − s(A)
c

.

This quantity τ in formula (6.5) is called interval of private time
on world line.

Concept of private time determine microlocal concept of time
in theory of relativity. According to this concept each material
point lives according to its own watch, and watches of diﬀerent
material points are synchronized only in very rough way: they

94

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

count time from the past to the future. This rough synchroniza-
tion is determined by polarization in Minkowsky space. Exact
synchronization of watches is possible only when material points
come to immediate touch with each other, i. e. when their world
lines intersect. However, even after such exact synchronization
in the point of next meeting watches of tho material points will
show diﬀerent times. This diﬀerence is due to diﬀerent ”life
paths” between two meetings.

Concept of private time is illustrated by so-called twins prob-
lem, well-known from science ﬁction. Suppose that one of twins
goes to far-away travel in interstellar spacecraft, while his brother
stays on the Earth. Which of them will be older when they meet
each other on the Earth in the end of space voyage.

The answer is: that one who stayed on the Earth will be older.
World lines of twins intersect twice. Both intersections occur on
the Earth, one before travel and other after travel. Its known that
Coordinate system associated with the Earth can be taken for
inertial coordinate system with high degree of accuracy (indeed,
acceleration due to rotation of the Earth around its axis and due
to orbital rotation around the Sun is not sensible in our everyday
life). Therefore world line of twin stayed on the Earth is straight
line. World line of twin in spacecraft is curved. In the beginning
of travel he accelerates reaching substantial velocity comparable
with light velocity in the middle of the path. Then he experiences
backward acceleration in order to brake before reaching target
point of his travel. Then he accelerates and brakes again in his
back way to the Earth. According to theorem 6.1 interval length
of curved world line connecting two events is shorter than interval
length of straight world line connecting the same two events.
Hence twin stayed on the Earth will be older.

Exercise 6.1. Remember proof of the fact that the length of
curved line connecting two points A and B in Euclidean space is

§ 7. DYNAMICS OF MATERIAL POINT.

95

greater than the length of straight line segment AB. By analogy
to this proof ﬁnd the proof for theorem 6.1.

§ 7. Dynamics of material point.

Motion of material point in theory of relativity is described by
its world line in Minkowsky space. Let’s choose natural parameter
on world line and consider four-dimensional tangent vector

(7.1)

u(s) =

dr(s)
ds

,

where r(s) is four-dimensional radius vector of events on world
line. Vector u is (7.1) is called vector of 4-velocity. It is time-like
vector and it is unit vector in Minkowsky metric: g(u, u) = 1.
Upon choosing some inertial coordinate system we can write
components of 4-velocity vector explicitly:

(7.2)

u =

Here v1, v2, v3 are components of three-dimensional velocity
vector v. Note that components u0, u1, u2, u3 of 4-velocity vector
are absolute numbers (without measure unit).
It is easy to see
from (7.2). Upon multiplying u by scalar mc with the measure
unit of momentum we get vector of 4-momentum

for material point with mass m. Vector p plays important role
the law of
in physics since there is fundamental law of nature:
conservation of 4-momentum.

96

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Momentum conservation law. Vector of 4-momentum of
material point which do not experience external action remains
unchanged.

According to the law just stated,

for particle that do not
experience external action we have p = const. Hence u = const.
Integrating the equation (7.1), for r(s) we derive

r(s) = r0 + u s.

Conclusion: in the absence of external action material point moves
uniformly along straight line.

External actions causing change of 4-momentum of material

point are subdivided into two categories:

(1) continuous;
(2) discrete.

Continuous actions are applied to material particle by external
ﬁelds. They cause world line to bend making it curved line. In
this case p 6= const. Derivative of 4-momentum with respect to
natural parameter s is called vector of 4-force:

(7.4)

dp
ds

= F(s).

Vector of 4-force in (7.4) is quantitative characteristic of the
action of external ﬁelds upon material particle. It is determined
by parameters of particle itself and by parameters of external
ﬁelds at current position of particle as well. We know that
vector of 4-velocity u is unit vector, therefore g(p, p) = m2 c2.
Diﬀerentiating this relationship with respect to s and taking into
account that components of matrix (2.7) are constant, we ﬁnd

(7.5)

g(u, F) = 0.

§ 7. DYNAMICS OF MATERIAL POINT.

97

The relationship (7.5) means that vector of 4-force is perpendicu-
lar to vector of 4-velocity in Minkowsky metric, i. e. force vector
is perpendicular to world line of particle.

Choosing some inertial coordinate system, we can replace nat-
ural parameter s in (7.5) by time variable t of this coordinate
system. Then, taking into account (7.3), from (7.4) we derive

The equation (7.7) is treated as relativistic analog of Newton’s

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Formulas (7.9) and (7.10) are the very ones which are in mind
when one says that mass in theory of relativity depends on
velocity.
It seems to me that such terminology is not so good.
In what follows we shall mostly use four-dimensional invariant
equation (7.4) and, saying mass, we shall imply mass at rest.

Discrete external actions appear
in those situations when 4-momen-
tum of material particle changes
abruptly in jump-like manner. Such
situation arise in particle collisions,
particle conﬂuence, and particle de-
cay. Collision of particles corre-
spond to that point in Minkowsky
space where world lines of two or
several particles come together. Af-
ter collision particles can simply ﬂy
out from that point. But if these
are molecules of ingredients in chemical reaction, then after col-
lision we would have new molecules of reaction products.
In a
similar way in collisions of atomic nuclei nuclear reactions occur.
Let’s consider simultaneous collision of k particles. Denote by
p1, . . . , pk their 4-momenta just before the collision. Suppose that
as a result of collision he have n new particles created from initial
ones. Denote by ˜p1, . . . , ˜pn 4-momenta of outgoing particles just
after the collision. If k = 1 this is particle decay process, while if
n = 1 we have particle conﬂuence into one composite particle.

approximately only in the limit of small velocities |v| ≪ c.

Let’s multiply zeroth component of 4-momentum of material
particle by c. Resulting quantity has the measure unit of energy.

particles, we get energy conservation law:

Thus, 4-momentum conservation law for collision includes both

three-dimensional momentum.

Note that for zero velocity v = 0 the above quantity (7.13)

does not vanish, but takes nonzero value

(7.15)

E = mc2.

This quantity is known as rest energy of material particle. For-
mula (7.15) is well-known. It reﬂects very important fact absent
in classical physics: the ability of energy to mass and mass to
energy conversion.
In practice conversion of energy to mass is
realized in particle conﬂuence (see M > m + m in formula (7.12)).
Converse phenomenon of particle decay yields mass defect (mass
decrease). Lost mass is realized in additional amount of kinetic
energy of outgoing particles. Total conversion of mass to en-
ergy is also possible. This happens in process of annihilation,
when elementary particle meets corresponding antiparticle. Large
amount of energy released in annihilation is scattered in form of
short-wave electromagnetic radiation.

§ 8. Four-dimensional form of Maxwell equations.

Starting from electromagnetic equations (cid:3)E = 0 and (cid:3)H = 0
in previous sections we have constructed and described Lorentz
transformations preserving form of these equations. We also have

given geometric and physical interpretation of Lorentz transfor-
mations and even have described dynamics of material points on
the base of new relativistic notion of space and time. Now time
has come to remember that equations (cid:3)E = 0 and (cid:3)H = 0
are not primary equations of electrodynamics, they were derived
from Maxwell equations. To have complete picture we should we
should write Maxwell equations in four-dimensional form. Let’s
begin with second pair of these equations containing charges and

In addition, we complement three-dimensional vector of current
density with one more component

By means of (8.4) and (8.5) we can rewrite Maxwell equations

diﬀerence in signs. Main diﬀerence is that components of vectors
E and H have exchanged their places. To exchange components
of vectors E and H in matrix (8.4) we need four-dimensional
analog of Levi-Civita symbol:

Four-dimensional form of Maxwell equations (8.6) and (8.11)

This tensor is called tensor of electromagnetic ﬁeld. Tensorial

This relationship (8.15) provides invariance of the form of Maxwell
equations (8.11) under Lorentz transformation (2.3). In order to
verify this fact it is suﬃcient to apply relationships (2.8) for
transforming derivatives and then remember well-known property

In (8.17) it is easy to recognize the transformation rule for com-

Due to (9.3) and (9.4) ﬁrst relationship (9.1) can be written as

(9.5)

F0q =

∂r0 −

∂A0

In order to calculate other components of tensor Fpq let’s ap-
ply (8.2) and second relationship (9.1). Thereby let’s take into
account that Fpq = F pq and Ap = −Ap for p, q = 1, 2, 3:

∂Ap

In essential, formula (9.9) is four-dimensional form of the rela-
tionships (9.1). It unites these two relationships into one.

Remember that vectorial and scalar potentials of electromag-
netic ﬁeld are not unique. They are determined up to a gauge

could be included into transformation rule for component of four-
dimensional potential A. However, if we assert that A0, A1, A2,
A3 are transformed as components of four-dimensional vector

and A0, A1, A2, A3 are obtained from them by index lowering
procedure (9.2), then we ﬁnd that quantities Fpq deﬁned by
formula (9.9) are transformed exactly by formula (8.15), as they
actually should.

From (9.10) one can easily derive explicit transformation
formulas for scalar potential ϕ and for components of three-

Theorem 9.1. Each skew-symmetric tensor ﬁeld F of type
(0, 2) in four-dimensional space satisfying diﬀerential equations
(8.11) is determined by some covector ﬁeld A according to the
above formula (9.9).

Proof. Each skew-symmetric tensor ﬁeld F of type (0, 2)
in four-dimensional space can be identiﬁed with pair of three-
dimensional vector ﬁelds E and H depending on additional pa-
rameter r0 = ct. In order to do this one should use (9.4). Then
equations (8.11) are written as Maxwell equations for E and H:

div H = 0,

rot E = −

.

Further construction of covector ﬁeld A is based on considerations
from § 3 of Chapter II, where three-dimensional vector-potential
and scalar potential were introduced. Then we denote A0 = ϕ
and thus convert three-dimensional vector-potential
into four-
dimensional vector. And the last step is index lowering procedure
given by formula (9.2). (cid:3)

Choice of vector ﬁeld A in formula (9.9), as we noted above,
has gauge uncertainty. In four-dimensional formalism this fact is
represented by gauge transformations

where ψ — is some arbitrary scalar ﬁeld. Formula (9.13) is four-

in Chapter II. It is easy to verify that gauge transformations
(9.13) do not break transformation rules (9.10) for contravariant
components of vector A.

Exercise 9.1. Prove theorem 9.1 immediately in four-dimen-
sional form without passing back to three-dimensional statements
and constructions.

§ 10. The law of charge conservation.

Earlier we have noted that charge conservation law can be
derived from Maxwell equations (see § 1 in Chapter II). To prove
this fact in four-dimensional formalism is even easier.
Let’s
diﬀerentiate the relationship (8.6) with respect to rp and add one
more summation with respect to index p:

Double diﬀerentiation in (10.1) is symmetric operation, while
tensor of electromagnetic ﬁeld F pq, to which it is applied,
is
skew-symmetric. Therefore the expression under summation in
left hand side of (10.1) is skew-symmetric with respect to indices
p and q. This leads to vanishing of double sum in left hand side
of formula (10.1). Hence we obtain

(10.2)

∂jp
∂rp = 0.

p=0

The equality (10.2) is four-dimensional form of charge conserva-
tion law. If we remember that j0 = cρ and r0 = ct, we see that
this equality coincides with (5.4) in Chapter I.

Conservation laws for scalar quantities (those like electric char-
ge) in theory of relativity are expressed by equations analogous

to (10.2) in form of vanishing of four-dimensional divergencies for
corresponding four-dimensional currents. For vectorial quantities
corresponding current densities are tensors. Thus the law of con-
servation of 4-momentum for ﬁelds is represented by the equation

Tensor T qp in (10.3) playing the role of current density of 4-mo-
mentum is called energy-momentum tensor.

Matrix (10.6) is skew-symmetric, it has (n − 1) independent com-

It is easy to verify that functions (10.8) satisfy ﬁrst series of
diﬀerential equations (10.7). Under the condition (10.4) they
satisfy last equation (10.7) as well. Thus, theorem is proved. (cid:3)

Theorem 10.1 can be easily generalized for arbitrary tensorial

currents. Its prove thereby remains the same in most.

equation (10.7) to be fulﬁlled for the functions (10.8).

Exercise 10.2. Clarify the relation of theorem 10.1 and theo-

rem on vortex ﬁeld in case of dimension n = 3.

§ 11. Note on skew-angular and
curvilinear coordinates.

In previous three sections we have managed to write in four-
dimensional form all Maxwell equations, charge conservation law,
and the relation of E, H and their potentials. The relationships
(8.6), (8.11), (9.9), (9.13), (10.2), which were obtained there, pre-
serve their shape when we transfer from one rectangular Cartesian
coordinate system to another. Such transitions are interpreted as
Lorentz transformations, they are given by Lorentz matrices.
However, all these relationships (8.6), (8.11), (9.9), (9.13), (10.2)
possess transparent tensorial interpretation. Therefore they can
be transformed to any skew-angular Cartesian coordinate system
as well. Thereby we would have minor diﬀerences:
the shape
of matrix g would be diﬀerent and instead of εpqks in (8.11) we
would require volume tensor with components

(11.1)

ωpqks = ±

116

CHAPTER III. SPECIAL RELATIVITY.

Matrix gpq in skew-angular coordinate system is not given by
formula (2.7), here it is arbitrary symmetric matrix determining
quadratic form of signature (1, 3). Therefore diﬀerential equations
(cid:3)E = 0 and (cid:3)H = 0, which we are started from, have not their
initial form. They are written as (cid:3)F pq = 0, where d’Alambert
operator is given by formula (2.6) with non-diagonal matrix gij.

In arbitrary skew-angular coordinate system none of axes
should have time-like direction. Therefore none of them can
be interpreted as time axis. Three-dimensional form of electrody-
namics equations, even if we could write them, would not have
proper physical interpretation in such coordinate system. In par-
ticular, interpretation of components of tensor F pq as components
of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in formula (8.4) would not be
physically meaningful.

Tensorial form of four-dimensional electrodynamics equations
enables us to make one more step toward increasing arbitrariness
in the choice of coordinate system: we can use not only skew-
angular, but curvilinear coordinates as well. To make this step we
need to replace partial derivatives by covariant derivatives:

(11.2)

∂
∂rp → ∇p

(see [3] for more details). Connection components required for
passing to covariant derivatives (11.2) are determined by compo-
nents of metric tensor. The latter ones in curvilinear coordinate
system do actually depend on r0, r1, r2, r3:

CHAPTER IV

LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM

IN THEORY OF RELATIVITY

§ 1. Principle of minimal action
for particles and ﬁelds.

B

Dynamics of material points in theory of relativity is described
by their world lines. These are time-like lines in Minkowsky space.
Let’s consider some world line corre-
sponding to real motion of some particle
under the action of external ﬁelds. Let’s
ﬁx two points A and B on this world
line not too far from each other. Then
consider small deformation of world line
in the range between these two points
A and B. Suppose that we have some
coordinate system in Minkowsky space
(either Cartesian, or curvilinear, no mat-
ter). Then our world line is given in

where s is natural parameter. Then deformed curve can be given

120

CHAPTER IV. LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM . . .

by the following four functions:

(1.2)

ˆri(s) = ri(s) + hi(ε, s), i = 0, . . . , 3.

Here s is original natural parameter on initial non-deformed world
line (1.1), while hi(ε, s) are smooth functions which are nonzero
only within the range between points A and B. Note that
functions hi(ε, s) in (1.2) depend on additional parameter ε which
is assumed to be small. Moreover, we shall assume that

(1.3)

hi(ε, s) → 0 as ε → 0.

Thus, in (1.2) we have whole family of deformed lines. This family
of lines is called variation of world line (1.1). Due to (1.3) we
have the following Taylor expansion for hi(ε, s):

(1.4)

hi(ε, s) = ε hi(s) + . . . .

Under the change of one curvilinear coordinate system for an-
other quantities hi(s) are transformed as components of four-
dimensional vector. This vector is called vector of variation of
world line, while quantities

(1.5)

δri(s) = εhi(s)

are called variations of point coordinates.
It is clear that they
also are transformed as components of four-dimensional vector.
Due to formulas (1.4) and (1.5) parametric equations of deformed
curves (1.2) are written as follows:

(1.6)

ˆri(s) = ri(s) + δri(s) + . . . .

By this formula we emphasize that terms other than linear with
respect to small parameter ε are of no importance.

§ 1. PRINCIPLE OF MINIMAL ACTION . . .

121

By varying functions hi(ε, s) in (1.2) and by varying parameter
ε in them we can surround segment of initial world line by a
swarm of its variations. Generally speaking, these variations do
not describe real dynamics of points. However, they are used
in statement of minimal action principle. Within framework of
Lagrangian formalism functional of action S is usually introduced,
this is a map that to each line connecting two points A and B put
into correspondence some real number S.

Principle of minimal action for particles. World line con-
necting two points A and B describes real dynamics of material
point if and only if action functional S reaches local minimum on
it among other lines being its small variations.

Action functional S producing number by each line should de-
pend only on that line (as geometric set of points in M ), but
it should not depend on coordinate system (r0, r1, r2, r3) in M .
By tradition this condition is called Lorentz invariance, though
changes of one curvilinear coordinate system by another form
much broader class of transformations than Lorentz transforma-
tions relating two rectangular Cartesian coordinate systems in
Minkowsky space.

Action functional in most cases is integral. For single point of
mass m in electromagnetic ﬁeld with potential A it is written as

(1.7)

S = −mc

ds −

g(A, u) ds.

Here q is electric charge of particle, while u = u(s) is vector of
its 4-velocity (unit tangent vector of world line). First integral
in (1.7) yields action for free particle (in the absence of exter-
nal ﬁelds), second integral describes interaction of particle with
electromagnetic ﬁeld.

122

CHAPTER IV. LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM . . .

If we consider system of N particles, then we should write
integral (1.7) for each of them and we should add all these
integrals. And ﬁnally, in order to get the action functional for
total system of ﬁeld and particles we should add integral of action
for electromagnetic ﬁeld itself:

Last integral in (1.8) deserves special consideration. This is
four-dimensional volume integral over the domain enclosed be-
tween two three-dimensional hyper-
surfaces V1 and V2. Hypersurfaces
V1 and V2 are space-like, i. e. their
normal vectors are time-like vectors.
These hypersurfaces determine the
ﬁssure between the future and the
past, and over this ﬁssure we inte-
grate in (1.8). Thereby change of
ﬁeld functions (here these are com-
ponents of vector-potential A) when
passing from V1 to V2 reﬂects evolution of electromagnetic ﬁeld
from the past to the future.

Electromagnetic ﬁeld is described by ﬁeld functions. Therefore
variation of ﬁeld is deﬁned in other way than that of particles.
Suppose that Ω is some restricted four-dimensional domain en-
closed between hypersurfaces V1 and V2. Let’s consider four
smooth functions hi(ε, r) = hi(ε, r0, r1, r2, r3) being identically

zero outside the domain Ω and vanishing for ε = 0. Let’s deﬁne

(1.9)

ˆAi(r) = Ai(r) + hi(ε, r)

and consider Taylor expansion of hi at the point ε = 0:

(1.10)

hi(ε, r) = ε hi(r) + . . . .

The following functions determined by linear terms in the above
Taylor expansions (1.10)

(1.11)

δAi(r) = ε hi(r)

are called variations of ﬁeld functions for electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Deformation of vector-potential (1.9) now can be written as

(1.12)

ˆAi(r) = Ai(r) + δAi(r) + . . . .

Principle of minimal action for ﬁelds. Field functions de-
termine actual conﬁguration of physical ﬁelds if and only if they
realize local minimum of action functional S in class of all varia-
tions with restricted support*.

The condition of minimum of action for actual ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tion and for actual world lines of particles, as a rule, is not used.
In order to derive dynamical equations for ﬁelds and particles it is
suﬃcient to have extremum condition (no matter minimum, max-
imum, or saddle point). For this reason minimal action principle
often is stated as principle of extremal action.

Exercise 1.1. Verify that hi(s) in (1.4) are transformed as

components of vector under the change of coordinates.

* Variations with restricted support are those which are identically zero

outside some restricted domain Ω.

§ 2. Motion of particle in electromagnetic ﬁeld.

In order to ﬁnd world line of relativistic particle in external
electromagnetic ﬁeld we shall apply particle version of extremal
action principle to functional (1.8). Let’s choose one of N par-
ticles in (1.8) and consider deformation (1.6) of its world line.
When we substitute deformed world line into (1.8) in place of
initial non-deformed one the value of last integral remains un-
changed. Thereby in ﬁrst term containing sum of integrals only
one summand changes its value, that one which represent the par-
ticle we have chosen among others. Therefore writing extremity
condition for (1.8) we can use action functional in form of (1.7).
The value of (1.7) for deformed world line is calculated as follows:

(2.1)

Formula (2.1) visually diﬀers from formula (1.7) because s is

is not unit vector. Therefore ﬁrst integral (1.7) is rewritten as
length integral (see (6.4) in Chapter III). In second integral (1.7)
unit tangent vector is replaced by vector K.

Let’s write in coordinate form both expressions which are under
integration in (2.1) taking into account that we deal with general
curvilinear coordinate system in Minkowsky space:

Now in order to derive diﬀerential equations for world line of
particle we apply extremity condition for S. It means that term
linear with respect to ε in power expansion for Sdef should be

magnetic ﬁeld (see formula (9.9) in Chapter III). For transforming

ter III. As a result we get the following equation for world line:

Comparing (2.6) with the equations (11.9) from Chapter III, we

get formula for the vector of four-dimensional force acting on a
particle with charge q in electromagnetic ﬁeld:

(2.7)

Fk =

Suppose that we have rectangular Cartesian coordinate system
in Minkowsky space. Then we can subdivide F into spatial and

force vector: f i =
c2 − |v|2 F i (see formula (7.6) in Chap-
ter III). Upon easy calculations with the use of formulas (7.2) and
(9.4) from Chapter III for force vector f we get

p

(2.8)

f = q E +

[v, H].

q

This formula (2.8) is exactly the same as formula for Lorentz force
(see (4.4) in Chapter I). Thus formula (2.7) is four-dimensional
generalization of formula for Lorentz force. Orthogonality condi-
tion for 4-force and 4-velocity (see (7.5) in Chapter III) for (2.7) is
fulﬁlled due to skew symmetry of tensor of electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Exercise 2.1. Prove that gauge transformation of action func-
tional (1.13) does not change dynamic equations of material point
in electromagnetic ﬁeld (2.6).

Exercise 2.2. Verify that the relationship (7.5) from Chap-

ter III holds for Lorentz force.

§ 3. Dynamics of dust matter.

Diﬀerential equation (2.6) describes motion of charged particles
in electromagnetic ﬁeld.
If the number of particles is not large,
then we can follow after the motion of each of them. When
describing extremely large number of particles continual limit is

§ 3. DYNAMICS OF DUST MATTER.

129

used, particles are replaced by continuous medium modeling their
collective behavior. Simplest model describing large number of
non-colliding particles is a model of dust cloud.
In this model

Fig. 3.1

Fig. 3.2

particles of cloud move regularly (not chaotically). Their world
lines can be modeled by regular family of lines ﬁlling the whole
space (see Fig. 3.1).

Another model is a model of ideal gas. Here particles also
do not collide each other, i. e. their world lines do not intersect.
However, their motion is chaotic (see Fig. 3.2). Therefore if we
ﬁll the whole space with their world lines, they would intersect.

Besides two models considered mentioned above, there are
models describing liquids and solid materials. Points of liquid
and solid media move regularly (as on Fig. 3.1). However, in
these media interaction of particles is essential. Therefore when
describing such media one should either use detailed microscopic
analysis and get macroscopic parameters by statistical averaging,
or should use some heuristic assumptions based on experiment.

In this book we consider only most simple model of dust cloud.
In this case one should assume Minkowsky space to be ﬁlled by
regular family of world lines. Some of them are world lines of real

130

CHAPTER IV. LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM . . .

particles, others are imaginary ones obtained by extrapolation in
continual limit. Therefore at each point of M we have unit vector
u, this is tangent vector to world line passing through this point.
This means that dynamics of dust cloud can be described by
vector ﬁeld u(r).

Apart from vector ﬁeld u, below we need scalar parameter ν(r)
which means the density of dust cloud. We deﬁne it as follows.
Let’s choose some small fragment of three-dimensional hypersur-
face in M orthogonal to vector u(r) at the point r. The number
of dust particles whose world lines cross this fragment is propor-
tional to its three-dimensional volume: N = ν(r) V , parameter
ν(r) is coeﬃcient of proportionality. Parameter ν(r) has measure
unit of concentration, it can be treated as concentration of par-
ticles in small fragment of dust cloud near the point r measured
in that inertial coordinate system for which particles of this small
fragment are at rest. By means of ν(r) and u(r) we compose new
four-dimensional vector

(3.1)

η(r) = c ν(r) u(r).

Vector (3.1) is called four-dimensional ﬂow density for particles
in cloud.
If we choose some inertial coordinate system, then
η0/c is interpreted as concentration of particles in dust cloud,
while other three components of four-dimensional vector η form
three-dimensional vector of ﬂow density.

Suppose that dust cloud is formed by identical particles with
mass m and charge q. Then four-dimensional current density
vector can be represented as follows:

(3.2)

(3.3)

j(r) = q η(r).

µ(r) = m η(r).

By analogy with (3.2) one can deﬁne mass ﬂow density vector:

§ 3. DYNAMICS OF DUST MATTER.

131

Total number of particles in cloud is ﬁxed. This conservation law
is written as the following equality for η:

(3.4)

∇pηp = 0.

From (3.4) and (3.2) one can derive charge conservation law in
form of the relationship (11.7) from Chapter III. Taking into
account (3.3), we get rest mass conservation law:

(3.5)

∇pµp = 0.

3

Rest mass conservation law here is fulﬁlled due to the absence of

(see § 7 in Chapter III).

Let’s consider dynamics of particles composing dust cloud.
Vector ﬁeld u is constituted by tangent vectors to world lines
of dust particles. Therefore these world lines can be determined
as integral curves of vector ﬁeld u, i. e. by solving the following
system of ordinary diﬀerential equations:

(3.6)

= ui(r(s)), i = 0, . . . , 3.

ds

Having determined world line of particle from diﬀerential equa-
tions, we know vector of its 4-velocity u(s). Now let’s calculate
covariant derivative of vector u(s) with respect to parameter s:

CHAPTER IV. LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM . . .

Calculating derivative dup/ds in (3.7) we take into account (3.6)
and the equality u(s) = u(r(s)). As a result we get

(3.8)

dup(s)

Xk=0

Substituting (3.8) into (3.7), we derive the following formula:

(3.9)

∇sup =

Xk=0

Right hand side of (3.9) is covariant derivative of vector ﬁeld u(r)
along itself (see more details in [3]). Substituting (3.9) into the
equations of the dynamics of material point, we get:

(3.10)

∇uu =

F
mc

.

Here F = F(r, u) is some external force ﬁeld acting on particles
of dust matter. For example in the case of charged dust in
electromagnetic ﬁeld the equation (3.10) looks like

(3.11)

In contrast to the equations (11.9) from Chapter III, which
describe dynamics of separate particle, here (3.10) are partial
diﬀerential equations with respect to components of vector ﬁeld
u(r). They describe dynamics of dust cloud in continual limit.
The equation for scalar ﬁeld ν(r) is derived from conservation law

we obtain a system of diﬀerential equations:

System of partial diﬀerential equations (3.12) yields complete
description for the dynamics of dust cloud.

Model of dust matter cam be generalized a little bit. We can
consider mixture of particles of diﬀerent sorts. For each sort of
particles we deﬁne its own vector ﬁeld u(i, r) and its own scalar
ﬁeld of concentration ν(i, r). Then formulas (3.2) and (3.3) for j
and µ are generalized as follows:

j(r) =

q(i) η(i, r),

µ(r) =

m(i) η(i, r).

n

Here η(i, r) = c ν(i, r) u(i, r). Each pair of ﬁelds u(i, r) and ν(i, r)
satisﬁes diﬀerential equations (3.12). We can derive mass and
charge conservation laws from these equations.

§ 4. Action functional for dust matter.

Let’s study the dynamics of dust matter in electromagnetic
ﬁeld within framework of Lagrangian formalism. Fort this purpose
we need to pass to continual
limit in action functional (1.8).
For the sake of simplicity we consider dust cloud with identical
particles. Omitting details of how it was derived, now we write

Instead of deriving formula (4.1) from (1.8) we shall verify this
formula indirectly. For this purpose we shall derive dynamical
equation (3.11) from principle of extremal action applied to action
functional (4.1).

For describing dust matter in (4.1) we have chosen vector ﬁeld
η(r) deﬁned in (3.1). Other two ﬁelds u(r) and ν(r) can be
expressed though vector ﬁeld η(r):

(4.2)

Dealing with variation of vector ﬁeld η(r) we should always
remember that components of this ﬁeld are not independent
functions. They satisfy diﬀerential equation (3.4).
In order
to resolve tis equation (3.4) we use slightly modiﬁed version of
theorem 10.1 from Chapter III.

Theorem 4.1. Let M be some n-dimensional manifold, where
n ≥ 2, equipped with metric gij. For each vector ﬁeld η with zero

Let’s deﬁne deformation of the ﬁeld η in a way similar to that

we used for vector-potential A in § 1:

(4.9)

ˆηp(r) = ηp(r) + ε ζp(r) + . . . .

Both ﬁelds ˆη and η satisfy diﬀerential equation (3.4). Hence
vector ﬁeld ζ deﬁned in (4.9) also satisfy this equation. Let’s

Theorem 4.1 does not specify tensor ﬁeld ϕpk in (4.10), this can
be any skew-symmetric tensor ﬁeld. However, we choose it in very
special form as follows:

(4.11)

ϕpk = ηp hk − hp ηk.

This choice can be motivated by the following theorem.

Theorem 4.2. For any two vector ﬁelds ζ and η, where η 6= 0,
both satisfying diﬀerential equation (3.4) there is vector ﬁeld h
such that vector ﬁeld ζ is given by formula

ζp =

∇k(ηp hk − hp ηk).

Our choice (4.11) leads to the following expression for the ﬁeld ˆη:

In order to bring the equation (4.17) just derived to its ultimate
form we use the relationships (4.2), which relate vector ﬁeld η
and vector ﬁeld u: ηp = c ν up. Since u is unit vector, we have

we have found that applying extremal action principle to S with
respect to the ﬁeld η one can derive dynamical equations for
velocity ﬁeld in dust cloud. Now we shall apply extremal action
principle to S with respect to vector-potential A. Deformation of
vector-potential is deﬁned according to (1.9), (1.10), (1.11), (1.12):

CHAPTER V

GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

§ 1. Transition to non-ﬂat metrics
and curved Minkowsky space.

Passing from classical electrodynamics to special theory of re-
lativity, in previous two chapters we have successively geometrized
many basic physical concepts. Having denoted r0 = ct and com-
bining r0 with components of three-dimensional radius-vector in
inertial coordinate system, we have constructed four-dimensional
space of events (Minkowsky space). This space appears to be
equipped with metric of signature (1, 3), which is called Min-
kowsky metric. Thereby inertial coordinate systems are inter-
preted as orthonormal bases in Minkowsky metric.

In four-dimensional formalism dynamics of material point is
described by vectorial diﬀerential equations, while Maxwell equa-
tions for electromagnetic ﬁeld are written in tensorial form. Due
to this circumstance in previous two chapters we managed to
include into consideration skew-angular and even curvilinear co-
ordinate systems in Minkowsky space. Thereby we got explicit
entries of metric tensor components gij, metric connection com-
ponents Γk

ij , and covariant derivatives ∇i in all our equations.

Next step in this direction is quite natural. One should keep
the shape of all equations and pass from ﬂat Minkowsky metric

This crucial step was ﬁrst made by Einstein. Theory he had dis-
covered in this way later was called Einstein’s theory of gravitation
or general theory of relativity.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Four-dimensional aﬃne space equipped with
orientation, polarization, and with metric of signature (1, 3) and
nonzero curvature (1.1) is called curved Minkowsky space.

In non-ﬂat Minkowsky space we loose some structures available
in ﬂat case.
In such space there are no coordinates for which
Minkowsky metric is given by matrix (2.7) from Chapter III, i. e.
here we have no inertial coordinate systems. This is substantial
loss, but it is not catastrophic since dynamic equation for material
points and Maxwell equations rewritten in vectorial and tensorial
form are not bound to inertial coordinate systems.

Geodesic lines in curved Minkowsky space do not coincide
with aﬃne straight lines. Therefore aﬃne structure becomes
excessive restriction in general relativity. As appears, one can
give up topologic structure of ﬂat space R4 as well. Even in
two-dimensional case, as we know, apart from deformed (curved)
plain, there are surfaces with more complicated topology: sphere,
torus and sphere with several handles glued to it (see [5]).
In
multidimensional case these objects are generalized in concept of
smooth manifold (see details in [2], [5], and [6]).

Smooth manifold M of dimension n is a topologic space each
point of which has a neighborhood (a chart) identical to some
neighborhood of a point in Rn. In other words M is covered by a
family of charts Uα, each of which is diﬀeomorphic to some open
set Vα in Rn. Such chart maps (chart diﬀeomorphisms) deﬁne

§ 2. ACTION FOR GRAVITATIONAL FIELD.

147

local curvilinear coordinate systems within their chart domains
Uα. At those points of manifold M , where two chart domains are
overlapping, transition functions arise. They relate one curvilinear
coordinate system with another:

(1.2)

˜ri = ˜ri(r1, . . . , rn), where i = 1, . . . , n,
ri = ri(˜r1, . . . , ˜rn), where i = 1, . . . , n.

According to deﬁnition of smooth manifold, transition functions
(1.2) are smooth functions (of class C∞). Transition functions
determine transition matrices S and T :

(1.3)

Presence of transition matrices (1.3) lead to full-scale theory of
tensors, which is almost literally the same as theory of tensors
for curvilinear coordinates in Rn (see [3]). The only diﬀerence
is that here we cannot choose Cartesian coordinates at all. This
is because in general there is no smooth diﬀeomorphic map from
manifold M to Rn.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Four-dimensional smooth manifold equipped
with orientation, polarization, and with metric of signature (1, 3)
is called generalized Minkowsky space or Minkowsky manifold.

Einstein equation.

Space of events in general relativity is some smooth Minkowsky
manifold M . This circumstance provides additional arbitrariness
consisting in choosing M and in choosing metric on M . Nonzero
curvature described by tensor (1.1) is interpreted as gravitational
ﬁeld. Gravitational ﬁeld acts upon material bodies and upon

CHAPTER V. GENERAL RELATIVITY.

electromagnetic ﬁeld enclosed within M . This action is due to
the presence of covariant derivatives in dynamic equations. The
magnitude of gravitational ﬁeld itself should be determined by
presence of matter in M in form of massive particles or in form of
electromagnetic radiation, i. e. we should have backward relation
between geometry of the space and its content.

In order to describe backward relation between gravitational
ﬁeld and other physical ﬁelds we use Lagrangian formalism and
extremal action principle. Let’s start from action functional (4.1)
in Chapter IV. It is sum of three integrals:

(2.1)

S = Smat + Sint + Sel.

First integral Smat is responsible for material particles in form of
dust cloud, second integral describes interaction of dust cloud and
electromagnetic ﬁeld, third term in (2.1) describes electromagnetic

Ricci tensor is symmetric (see [3]). Scalar curvature R is obtained
by contracting Ricci tensor and metric tensor gqj with respect to
both indices q and j. This fact is obvious due to (2.5) and (2.4).

This parameter is called cosmological constant. However, accord-

further we shall use action Sgr in form of (2.3).

Note also that metric tensor describing gravitational ﬁeld enters
in implicit form into all summand in (2.2). Therefore we need
not add special terms describing interaction of gravitational ﬁeld
with material particles and electromagnetic ﬁeld. Moreover, such
additional terms could change the form of dynamical equations for
matter and form of Maxwell equations for electromagnetic ﬁeld
thus contradicting our claim that these equations are the same in
general and in special relativity.

When substituting (2.14) into action integral (2.3) we should note

It follows from (2.6). Now we shall not calculate deformations of

§ 4 and § 5 below. However, we introduce notation

Sm.f. = Smat + Sint + Sel.

Here Sm.f. denotes overall action for all material ﬁelds other than
gravitation. The number of terms in the sum (2.16) could be much

if one consider more complicated models for
describing matter. But in any case action of gravitational ﬁeld is
excluded from this sum since gravitational ﬁeld plays exceptional
role in general relativity. Now we shall write deformation of the

§ 3. Four-dimensional momentum
conservation law for ﬁelds.

Tensor T in right hand side of Einstein equation (2.18) is called
energy-momentum tensor for material ﬁelds.
It is determined
by the relationship (2.17) and comprises contributions from all
material ﬁelds and their interactions. In the model of dust matter
in electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor T is composed of three parts (see
formula (2.16)).

Energy-momentum tensor is related with 4-momentum conser-
vation law for material ﬁelds. In order to derive this conservation
law we use well-known Bianchi identity:

(3.1)

∇kRp

sij + ∇iRp

sjk + ∇jRp

ski = 0.

154

CHAPTER V. GENERAL RELATIVITY.

More details concerning Bianchi identity (3.1) can be found in [2]
and [6]. Let’s contract this identity with respect to i and p:

(3.2)

∇kRsj +

∇pRp

sjk − ∇jRsk = 0.

Here we used skew symmetry of curvature tensor with respect
to last pair of indices (see [3]). Let’s multiply (3.2) by gsj and
contract it with respect to double indices s and j. Upon slight

the whole variety of material ﬁelds.

Energy-momentum tensor is symmetric therefore the order of

§ 4. Energy-momentum tensor
for electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Energy-momentum tensor for whole variety of material ﬁelds
is deﬁned by the relationship (2.17). By analogy with (2.17) we
deﬁne energy-momentum tensor for electromagnetic ﬁeld:

Basic ﬁelds in the action Sel are covariant components of vector-

(4.2)

Fij = ∇iAj − ∇jAi =

∂Aj
∂ri −

(see also formula (11.5) in Chapter III). Ultimate expression in
right hand side of (4.2) has no entry of connection components

deformation of metric (2.6). Upon raising indices we get

Formula (4.6) shows that 4-momentum conservation law for sepa-
rate electromagnetic ﬁeld is not fulﬁlled. This is due to momen-
tum exchange between electromagnetic ﬁeld and other forms of
matter, e. g. dust matter.

Exercise 4.2. Calculate components of energy-momentum

ric. Compare them with components of Maxwell tensor, with den-
sity of energy, and with vector of energy ﬂow for electromagnetic
ﬁeld (see formulas (2.5) and (2.15) in Chapter II).

§ 5. Energy-momentum tensor
for dust matter.

Let’s consider energy-momentum tensor related with last two
terms Smat and Sint in the action (2.16). They contain entries of
vector ﬁeld η whose components satisfy diﬀerential equation

(5.1)

∇pηp = 0,

3

p=0
X

see (3.4) in Chapter IV. This circumstance diﬀers them from com-
ponents of vector-potential A. Metric tensor gij enters diﬀerential
equation (5.1) through connection components Γk
ij of metric con-
nection. Therefore by deformation of metric gij → ˆgij one cannot
treat ηp as metric independent quantities.

158

CHAPTER V. GENERAL RELATIVITY.

In order to ﬁnd truly metric independent variables for dust
matter we use formula (4.7) from Chapter IV and rewrite diﬀer-
ential equation (5.1) as follows:

Denote ˆηp = ηp
− det g . These quantities ˆηp can be treated as
metric independent ones since diﬀerential constraint for them is
written in form of the equation that does not contain metric:

p

Expressing ηp through ˆηp, for action functional Sint describing

interaction of dust matter and electromagnetic ﬁeld we get

It is easy to see that integral (5.3) does not depend on metric
tensor. Therefore action functional Sint makes no contribution to
overall energy-momentum tensor.

Now let’s express ηp through ˆηp in action functional Smat for

dust matter. As a result we get formula

Smat = −m

are obtained by raising indices p and q:

Using collinearity of vectors u and η (see formula (3.1) in Chap-

energy-momentum tensor for dust matter:

Let’s compare (5.9) with analogous formula (4.6) for energy-
momentum tensor of electromagnetic ﬁeld. Right hand sides of
these two formulas diﬀer only in sign. This fact has transparent
interpretation.
It means that in our model the overall energy-
momentum tensor for matter

Tm.f. = Tmat + Tel

satisﬁes diﬀerential equation (3.6). This fact is in complete
agreement with 4-momentum conservation law.

Another important conclusion, which follows from of (4.6) and
(5.9), is that 4-momentum conservation law for the whole variety
of material ﬁelds can be derived from dynamical equations for
these ﬁelds. Therefore this law is valid also in special relativity,
where Einstein equation (2.18) is not considered and where in
general case for ﬂat Minkowsky metric it is not fulﬁlled.

Exercise 5.1. Derive the relationship (5.8) on the base of equa-

tions (3.4) and (4.19) from Chapter IV.

§ 6. Concluding remarks.

Event space in general theory of relativity is some Minkowsky
manifold M with Minkowsky metric of signature (1, 3). This
metric is determined by material content of the space according
to Einstein equation (2.18). However, topology of the manifold
M has great deal of arbitrariness. This manifold can have local
singularities at the points with extremely high concentration of

§ 6. CONCLUDING REMARKS.

161

matter. Such objects are called black holes. Moreover, global
topology of M also can be nontrivial (other than topology of R4).
In contemporary physics most popular models of M include big
bang in the very beginning of times. According to these models
in far past times our Universe M was extremely small, while
density of matter in it was extremely high. In further evolution
our Universe was expanding up to its present size. Will this
expansion last inﬁnitely long or it will change for contraction ?
This problem is not yet solved. The answer to this question
depends on estimates of total amount of matter in the Universe.

In this book we cannot consider all these fascinating problems
of modern astrophysics and cosmology. However, I think the
above theoretical material makes suﬃcient background for to
continue studying these problems e. g. in books [2], [7], and [8].
I would like also to recommend the book [9] of popular genre,
where these problems are discussed in commonly understandable
and intriguing manner.

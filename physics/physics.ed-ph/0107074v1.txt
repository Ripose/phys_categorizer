Abstrat

I de(cid:28)ne 1+1 dimensional de Sitter manifold in this paper and I onsider

various oordinate systems on it.

I will demonstrate some introdutory

aspets of the general theory of relativity using the transformations between

these oordinate systems. The problem might be of interest for physis and

mathematis students as well as for physis teahers.

Introdution

At (cid:28)rst I will stress the importane of 3 + 1 version of de Sitter manifold

in relativisti osmology (in(cid:29)ation) and quantum (cid:28)eld theory in urved

spaetime. For more details see for example the book of Birrell and Davies

[1℄, detailed informations about the (osmologial) in(cid:29)ation an be found

in [2℄ or in reent papers onerning the in(cid:29)ation. I suppose that the reader

of this text is familiar with (notation) of modern di(cid:27)erential geometry. If

not see for example the introdutory pages of books [3℄, or [4℄. Now let us

start with de(cid:28)nition:

Def.: 2D de Sitter manifold (DS2

) is de(cid:28)ned by the equation

x2 + y2

t2 = a2

So, if we introdue the new oordinates (r, φ) to desribe DS2

by the

following equations

then we an write the indued metri tensor g on DS2

in the form:

Looking on the spae-time harater of vetors ∂r and ∂φ (i.e. evaluating
g(∂r, ∂r) and g(∂φ, ∂φ)) we will see that the oordinates φ and r orrespond
to spae oordinate and time oordinate respetivelly. The ut of DS2
the surfae (see (cid:28)g.1.) t = const is a irle parallel with the xy plane with
the radius equal to r = √a2 + t2

. This ut represents the ordinary spae

by

(or spae), whih volume is equal to

V ol1 = 2πr = 2π

r = a cosh(θ)

2 Killing's vetor (cid:28)eld on DS2

The isometri (ontinous) transformations of any smooth manifold (espe-

ially DS2
) are generated by some vetor (cid:28)eld - say V . We think by "are
generated" that the (cid:29)ow of V is an isometri transformation of the manifold
under onsideration. Suh a vetor (cid:28)eld V is the Killing's vetor (vetor
(cid:28)eld). The ondition for V to be the Killing's vetor is well known (the

Killing's equation) - see e.g. [1℄:

V g = 0 ,

L

V is the Lie derivative with respet to V . Let us denote x0 = θ and

where L
x1 = φ . Then the Killing' s equations for DS2

may be written as follows

V kgij,k + V k

,i gkj + V k

,j gik = 0

(i, j, k

It is very simple to (cid:28)nd the general solution of the system (10). The result

is

V

≡

V 1∂1 + V 2∂2 = A cos(φ

A tanh(θ) sin(φ

Now, we shall separate V into two parts and we shall disuss their

meaning:

(i.) Let us take

V rot = B∂φ
makes the rotation of DS2

.

It is lear that the (cid:29)ow of V rot
B around the t axis. (If B = 0 then we have the identity transformation.)
The spae-time harater of V rot

is given by its length

with the veloity

g(V rot, V rot) = B2g(∂φ, ∂φ) = B2r2 > 0 .

(12)

is a spae-like vetor (cid:28)eld and the integral urves of this (cid:28)eld are

So V rot

not worldlines of a real ob jet.

is invariant under the (cid:29)ow of B∂φ (i.e. under the rotations around the
t axis as was said in (i.)). So we an put φ0 = 0 without lost of generality.

6 Conlusion

We have started from the de Sitter manifold, whih is a speial ase of

the losed Robertson-Walker Universe. Then we have presented, using the

suitable oordinate transformation (19), well de(cid:28)ned part of it as the stati

Universe, i.e. we have introdued on this part of DS2

the world time. One

an disover on this example, that the determination of the arrow of time,

using the expansion of the Universe, may be problemati. Thereafter we

have used other oordinate transformations - eqs. (23) and (25) - and we

have presented the part of DS2

as the open Robertson-Walker Universe.

The motivation and the interpretation for these oordinate transformations

is given by the analysis of the Killing's vetor (cid:28)eld od DS2
of light in DS2

, whih we have gave in the seond and third setions. The

and the motion

idea to present a part of losed in(cid:29)ating

Universe as an open in(cid:29)ating

2

Universe has the great use in the osmology, espeially in the senarios of

evolution of (our) very early Universe. From the physial point of view

the in(cid:29)ating Universe (as DS2

) is an Universe (cid:28)lled by the homogenous

on(cid:28)guration of a salar (cid:28)eld with nonzero (positive) energy density. This

idea was presented the (cid:28)rst time in the work [5℄. It leads to the possibility

of "the quantum reation of an open Univers" - see for example [2℄ or the

short paper [6℄.

2

by in(cid:29)ating we think, that the sale parameter a grows exponetially for t > 0

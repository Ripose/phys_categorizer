The motion of a stone skimming over a water surface is considered. A simpliﬁed description of
the collisional process of the stone with water is proposed. The maximum number of bounces is
estimated by considering both the slowing down of the stone and its angular stability. The conditions
for a successful throw are discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Nearly everyone has tried to throw a stone on a lake
and count the number of bounces the stone was able to
make. Of course the more, the better.1 Our intuition
gives us some empirical rules for the best throw: the best
stones are ﬂat and rather circular; one has to throw them
rather fast and with a small angle with the water surface;
a small kick is given with a ﬁnger to give the stone a spin.
Of course these rules can be understood using the laws of
physics: the crucial part of the motion is the collisional
process of the stone with the water surface. The water
surface exerts a reaction (lift) force on the stone, allowing
it to rebound. This process is quite complex because it
involves the description of the ﬂow around the immersed
stone.2,3 Some energy is also dissipated during a collision,
so that after a few rebounds, the initial kinetic energy of
the stone is fully dissipated and the stone sinks.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a simpliﬁed
description of the bouncing process of a stone on water,
in order to estimate the maximum number of bounces
performed by the stone. This problem provides an enter-
taining exercise for undergraduate students, with simple
explanations for empirical laws that almost everyone has
experienced.

II. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS

Consider a ﬂat stone, with a small thickness and a mass
M . The stone is thrown over a ﬂat water surface. The
angle between the stone surface and the water plane is
θ. A schematic view of the collisional process is shown
in Fig. 1. The velocity V is assumed to lie in a sym-
metry plane of the stone (the plane of the paper). The
diﬃcult part of the problem is, of course, to model the
reaction force due to the water, which results from the
ﬂow around the stone during the stone-water contact. It
is not the aim of this paper to give a detailed descrip-
tion of the ﬂuid ﬂow around the colliding stone. Rather
I shall use a simpliﬁed description of the force keeping
only the main ingredients of the problem. First, the ve-
locity V of the stone is expected to be (at least initially)
the order of a few meters per second. For a stone with
a characteristic size a of the order of a few centimeters,
the Reynolds number, deﬁned as
e = V a/ν, with ν the
10−6 m2 s−1 for water), is of or-
kinematic viscosity (ν

105, that is, much larger than unity.4 In this
der
(inertial) regime, the force due to the water on the stone
is expected on dimensional grounds to be quadratic in
the velocity and proportional to the apparent surface of
the moving object and the mass density of the ﬂuid.5 Be-
cause the stone is only partially immersed in water during
the collisional process, we expect the force to be propor-
tional to the immersed surface (see Fig. 1). The force
can be adequately decomposed into a component along
the direction of the stone (that is, along t, see Fig. 1)
and a component perpendicular to it (that is, along n).
The latter corresponds to the lift component of the force,
and the former corresponds to a friction component (of
water along the object). I write the reaction force due to
water, F, as:

F =

Cf ρwV 2Simt ,

where Cl and Cf are the lift and friction coeﬃcients, ρw is
the mass density of water, Sim is the area of the immersed
surface, and n is the unit vector normal to the stone (see
Fig. 1). Note that in general, both Cl and Cf are func-

tions of the tilt angle θ and incidence angle β, deﬁned as
the angle between velocity V and the horizontal. In the
simpliﬁed analysis I will assume that both Cl and Cf are
constant and independent of tilt and incidence angles.6

≪

This assumption is not a strong one because ricochets
are generally performed with a small tilt angle, θ, and a
small incidence angle, β. If one denotes the initial com-
ponents of the incident velocity by Vx0 and Vz0 (parallel
and perpendicular to the water surface, respectively), the
latter assumption amounts to Vz0

Vx0.

We expect the lift force to be maximum when the ob-
ject is only partially immersed due to the lack of symme-
try between the two sides of the stone. Therefore, if the
object reaches a depth such that it becomes completely
immersed, the lift force would be greatly diminished and
would probably not be able to sustain the weight of the
stone anymore. For simplicity, I will assume that the
lift force vanishes for completely immersed objects. The
model for the force in Eq. (1) is crude, but it is expected
to capture the main physical ingredients of the stone-
water interaction. It might fail for lower stone velocities
or larger incidence angles, where a bulge of water could
be created and aﬀect the lift and friction forces on the
stone.2 However, in this case it is expected that the stone
will be strongly destabilized during the collision process
and perform only a very small number of bounces. We
will restrict ourselves to large initial velocities and small
incidence angles, such that the number of bounces is suf-
ﬁciently large.

III. EQUATIONS OF MOTION

Consider the collisional process, that is, the time dur-
ing which the stone is partially immersed in water.
I
will assume in this section that the incidence angle θ be-
tween the stone and the water surface is constant during
the collisional process. The validity of this assumption is
considered in detail in Sec. V. The origin of time, t = 0,
corresponds to the instant when the edge of the stone
reaches the water surface. During the collisional process,
the equations of motion for the center of mass velocity
are

Equation (2) is non-linear due to the V 2 terms on the
right-hand side, but also due to the dependence of the
immersed area, Sim, on the height z. However, we can
propose a simple approximation scheme: the magnitude

and it might fail in the last few rebounds of a stone skip
sequence.

With this approximation, Eq. (2b) decouples from
Eq. (2a). I thus ﬁrst focus the discussion on the equation
for the height z, which is the height of the immersed edge
(see Fig. 1). Note that the equation for z is equivalent
to the equation of the center of mass position, Eq. (2b)
because θ is assumed to be constant (see Sec. V for a de-
tailed discussion of this point). Hence, we may identify
Vz with dz/dt and Eq. (2b) yields a closed equation for
the height z.

IV. COLLISIONAL PROCESS

To solve Eq. (2b) we need to prescribe the z depen-
dence of the immersed area Sim. This quantity depends
on the precise shape of the stone. A natural choice is
circular, which I will treat in Sec. IV B. However, it is
enlighting to ﬁrst consider a square shape; this shape
greatly simpliﬁes the mathematics and already contains
the basic mechanisms involved.

The equation of motion for z, Eq. (2b), thus becomes

qualitatively) the collisional process and obtain the con-
dition for the stone to bounce.

I ﬁrst introduce dimensionless variables to simplify
the calculations. The dimensionless height, ˜z, time, τ ,

Here again, the condition for the stone to bounce is

shape of the stone near its edge). Moreover, we remark
that for small Vz0, the energy E goes to zero, so that ˜zmax
is deﬁned in this case by
(˜zmax) = 0. If also use the pre-
vious approximation, we obtain ˜zmax = (15α/4√2)2/3.
The condition for the stone to bounce, ˜zmax < 2, there-
fore yields α < 16/15. In terms of Vx0, this condition
gives again a minimum critical velocity for skimming,
deﬁned as Vc =

This result is thus close to the “exact” condition found
in Eq. (14) for the Vz0 = 0 case.

C. Energy Dissipation

I have so far described the rebound of the stone by ana-
lyzing its vertical motion. This analysis gave a minimum
velocity for skimming which results from the balance be-
tween the weight of the stone and the lift of the force due
to water. However, some energy is dissipated during the
collision due to the “friction” contribution of the force
(the component along x). This mechanism of dissipation
leads to another minimum velocity condition, in terms
of the balance between dissipation and initial kinetic en-
ergy. Only a qualitative description of the dissipation is
given here.

As shown by Eq. (2), the component Fx of the reac-
tion force in the x direction (parallel to the water sur-
face) will decrease the velocity of the stone. Then after
a few bounces, the condition for the stone to bounce,
Eq. (8) or Eq. (14), will no longer be satisﬁed and the

in the x-component of the velocity using the equation
for the center of mass position, Eq. (2a). If we multiply
both sides of Eq. (2a) by Vx and integrate over a collision
time, we obtain the decrease in the kinetic energy in the
x direction in terms of the work of the reaction force:

The quantity ℓ = Vxtcoll is the distance along x traversed

larger than the initial kinetic energy, the stone would be
stopped during the collision. Using Eq. (15), this condi-
tion can be written explicitly as 1

previous one, Eq. (14). I thus consider in the following
that Eq. (19) is the criterion for the stone to skim over
water.

V. WHY GIVE THE STONE A SPIN?

−

The previous calculations assumed a constant angle θ.
It is obvious that the rebound of the stone is optimized
when θ is small and positive (see, for example, the value
of the force constant C = Cl cos θ
Cf sin θ which de-
creases when θ increases). Now, if after a collision, the
stone is put in rotation around the y-axis (see Fig. 1),
that is, ˙θ
= 0, its orientation would change by an appre-
ciable amount during free ﬂight: the incidence angle θ
for the next collision has little chance to still be in a fa-
vorable situation. The stone performs, say, at most one
or two more collisions. There is therefore a need for a
stabilizing angular motion. This is the role of the spin of
the stone.

Let us denote ˙φ0 as the rotational velocity of the stone
around the symmetry axis parallel to n in Fig. 1. I ne-
glect in the following any frictional torque on the stone
(associated with rotational motion). During the collision,
the reaction force due to the water is applied only to the
immersed part of the stone and results in a torque applied

6
·

on the stone. For simplicity, I consider only the lift part
of the force. Its contribution to the torque (calculated at
the center O of the stone) can be readily calculated as
Fliftey, where ey is the unit vector in the y
M
direction in Fig. 1 and P , the point of application of the
lift force, is located at the center of mass of the immersed
area. This torque is in the y direction and will eventually
aﬀect the angular motion along θ. However a spin motion
around n induces a stabilizing torque: this is the well-
known gyroscopic eﬀect.7 The derivation of the equation
of motion of the rotating object (the Euler equations)
is a classic problem and is treated in standard mechan-
ics textbooks (see for example, Ref. 7). On the basis of
these equations, it is possible to derive the stabilizing gy-
roscopic eﬀect. This derivation is brieﬂy summarized in
the Appendix.

As discussed above, the corresponding situation is unsta-
ble. On the other hand, spin motion induces a stabilizing
torque that can maintain θ around its initial value. The
eﬀect of the torque can be neglected if, after a collision
with the water, the maximum amplitude of the motion

VI. AN ESTIMATE FOR THE MAXIMUM
NUMBER OF BOUNCES

The estimation of the maximum number of bounces is
the most diﬃcult and tentative part of the analysis be-
cause many factors can in principle slow down or desta-
bilize the stone, some of which are extremely diﬃcult to
model (such as irregularities of the water surface and the
wind). We shall assume the idealized situation described
above (perfect surface, no wind, idealized reaction force)
and focus on two speciﬁc factors, which appear, at least
intuitively, as natural candidates for stopping the stone.

A. Slow down of the stone

As I have discussed in Sec. IV C, energy is dissipated
during a collision and the x component of the velocity of
the stone will decrease during each collision: after a few
collisions, all the initial kinetic energy will be dissipated.
This process can be easily formulated.

I consider a succession of N collisions. Between two
collisions, the motion is parabolic (wind and air friction
are neglected) and the initial x component of the velocity
at the next collision is equal to the ﬁnal x component of
the velocity at the end of the previous collision. The
important point to note is that the energy loss during
one collision, Eq. (17), is independent of the velocity Vx0
before the collision. Therefore, the velocity of the stone
after N collisions obeys the relation

so that the stone will be stopped at a collision number
Nc such that the total energy loss is larger than the ini-
tial kinetic energy (similar to the argument leading to
the critical velocity for skimming, Vc, in Eq. (19)). This
criterion corresponds to V 2
x [Nc] = 0 in Eq. (22), and Nc
is given accordingly by

It is interesting to calculate the distance between two
successive collisions. As noted, the motion of the stone
is parabolic out of the water:

sions N is given by Eq. (22). On the other hand, Vz does
not depend on the number of collisions because the stone
rebounds “elastically” in the z direction, as follows from

the analysis of the collisional process in Sec. IV (see, for
example, the conservation of the energy E during the col-
lision discussed for the circular stone). If we use Eq. (22),
we obtain the simple result

ing to Nc = 17 (using the same values for the parameters as
those given in the text). The vertical dashed line indicates
that Nc = 17.

B. Angular destabilization

However, there is another possible destabilizing mech-
anism in the collision process. As was discussed in Sec. V,
the rotational stability of the stone is crucial in the colli-
sional process. A criterion for stability has been found in
the form of a minimum spin velocity of the stone. How-
ever, each collision will perturb the rotational motion and
the sum of all these eﬀects can eventually bypass the sta-
bility condition. This argument can be easily formulated.
As shown above, the amplitude of the angular motion of

pletely destabilized for a collision number Nc such that

If we use the same numerical values as before, we ob-
5 for a initial spin velocity
tain, for example, Nc ≃
φ0 = 5 rev/s and Nc = 38 (the world record1) for
φ0 = 14 rev/s. Note, however, that there is a quite large
uncertainty of the numerical prefactors in the above es-
timate of Nc, and this estimate is merely qualitative and
should not be taken literally.

VII. DISCUSSION

At the level of our description, the maximum number
of bounces results from the combination of the two previ-
ous mechanisms: slow down and angular destabilization.
The maximum number of bounces is therefore given by
the minimum of the two previous estimates, in Eqs. (23)
and (25).

The estimate N sd

c obtained in Eq. (23) from the slow
down of the stone depends only (quadratically) on the ini-
tial velocity of the stone: in principle, a very large num-
ber of bounces could be reached by increasing the initial
velocity of the stone. But on the other hand, the angu-
lar destabilization process results in a maximum value of
N spin
which is independent of the initial velocity of the
c
stone, as indicated by Eq. (25). This shows that even
if the initial velocity of the stone is very large, that is,
N sd
1, the stone will be stopped by angular destabi-
lization after N spin
bounces. In other words, the initial
“kick” that puts the stone in rotational motion is a key
factor for a good throw.

c ≫

c

The results presented here are in agreement with our
intuition for the conditions of a good throw. Some of the
results are also in agreement with observations, for ex-
ample, the acceleration of the number of collisions at the
end of the throw (a phenomenon known as “pitty-pat” in
stone skipping competitions1). Some easy checks of the
assumptions underlying our calculations could be per-
formed, even without any sophisticated apparatus. For
example, taking pictures of the water surface after the
ricochets would locate the positions of the collisions (be-
cause small waves are produced at the surface of water).
A simple test of the variation of the distance between
two collisions as a function of collision number, Eq. (24),
would then be possible. A more ambitious project would
be to design a “catapult,” allowing one to throw stones
with a controlled translational and spin velocity (together
with the incidence angle of the stone on water). A mea-
surement of the maximum number of bounces performed
for various throw parameters would allow us to check the

assumptions underlying the present simple analysis and
to determine some of the parameters involved in the de-
scription (such as µ and ℓ). It would be also interesting to
repeat the experiments reported in Ref. 2 using modern
techniques (such as fast cameras), in order to image and
analyze in particular the rebound process as a function of
the throw parameters. Hopefully a better understanding
of the mechanisms of stone skipping will allow someone
to break the actual world record!

APPENDIX A: APPENDIX

In Eq. (A1), Iα, ωα, and Nα (α = 1, 2, 3) are respectively
the moment of inertia, angular velocity, and torque along
the direction of a particular principal axis, denoted as
α.
In our case, the direction 1 is taken along the axis
perpendicular to the vectors n and t (the direction 1 is
along the y axis in Fig. 1), the direction 2 along n and the
direction 3 along t. We therefore have ω1 = ˙θ, and due
to the symmetry of the circular stone, I1 = I3
J1 and
I2
J0. Moreover, because only the lift component of
the reaction force (along n) is considered in the present
analysis, we have N1

≡ Mθ and N2 = N3 = 0.

Equation (A1b) yields immediately that ˙ω2 = 0. We
therefore have ω2 = ˙φ0, with ˙φ0 the initial spin velocity.
Equation (A1c) can be therefore written as:

6 Note that the nontrivial point is to assume that Cl does not
vanish and reaches a ﬁnite value in the small θ and β limit.
We may invoke the ﬁnite aspect ratio (thickness over lateral

size) of the object. For example, if the stone is an ellipsoid
of revolution with thickness h and radius a, with h ≪ a,
we expect Cl ∼ h/a.5 However the proportionality constant
is expected to be suﬃciently large so that the lift eﬀect is
non-negligible. This property is exempliﬁed by water skiing.
In this case, the lift force is suﬃciently large to sustain
the weight of a skier on small boards, while both tilt and
incidence angles are close to zero.

8 It is amusing to note that the laws of friction for the
stone are similar to those of solid friction. We have indeed
Fx = µM g, with µ = ˜C/C, independent of the velocity and
surface of the stone. Of course, the same result holds for
water skiing, which is not obvious.

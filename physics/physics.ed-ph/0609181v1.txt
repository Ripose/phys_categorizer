(Dated: August 7, 2013)

We present two methods for describing, from a pedagogical point of view, the solutions of Ein-
stein’s equations applied to a homogeneous and isotropic universe. In the ﬁrst method, we deﬁne an
eﬀective gravitational potential of the universe, and the second method makes use of the fact that
we can deﬁne a dynamical system of equations. The methods are applied to diﬀerent cosmological
models whose properties are discussed in turn. The ultimate intention is to provide simple examples
to be revised in a ﬁrst Cosmology course for undergraduates.

INTRODUCTION

questions reviewed and answered in[4, 5].

In any introductory course on Cosmology, some ques-
tions undoubtedly arise once the students become famil-
iar with the equations describing the evolution of a ho-
mogeneous and isotropic universe. These are: a) which
is the universe made of?; b) what is the curvature of the
universe? c) how did the universe expand in the past
according to the answers in a) and b)?.

It is interesting to note that present technology has al-
lowed the humankind to partially answer those questions
with some important accuracy[1, 2, 3]. However, such an
improvement in our knowledge of the universe will take
still some years to reach the textbooks for undergradu-
ates.

In this paper, we brieﬂy review the basic equations
of the evolution of the universe, and describe how the
latter evolves according to its material contents and cur-
vature. It is not our aim to give an exhaustive study of
the gravitational dynamics that arises from the equations
of Einstein’s General Relativity (GR), but rather to give
some tools to help students to understand the richness
of the solutions of the Einstein’s equations in the case of
a homogeneous and isotropic universe. In other words,
we will focus our attention in the answer to question c)
above.

In the same line, our intention is also to provide simple
pedagogical exercises, and to solve them with the help of
analytical methods which are of widespread use in the
specialized literature. The chosen examples in this paper
are appropriate, in our opinion, for a ﬁrst undergraduate
course on Cosmology.

We shall not discuss how we can determine the mate-
rial content of the universe and its true nature through
observations, nor how its curvature is measured. We will
only mention brieﬂy how such quantities are obtained,
and give the reader some interesting references and inter-
net links where more detailed information can be found.
However, non-experts will ﬁnd a comprehensible sum-
mary of modern Cosmology in[3], and some interesting

The present manuscript is organized as follows.
In
Sec. II, we review the metric quantities that describe
a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime, and how they
are inﬂuenced by the material content of the universe
through the equations of Einstein’s General Relativity.
We describe the types of matter we shall consider, and
how each one is classiﬁed according to their equation of
state.

We shall introduce the so-called density parameters,
which measure the relative contribution of each compo-
nent to the total material content of the universe. These
parameters will play a central role in the subsequent cal-
culations. Due to its particular importance, we will take
some space to discuss the signiﬁcance of the curvature’s
density parameter.

In Sec. III, we describe how the Friedmann equation
can be used to deﬁne an eﬀective gravitational potential
of the universe, so that we can visualize the expansion
of the universe in a similar fashion as one describes the
motion of a single particle in Classical Mechanics.

In Sec. IV, we use again the Friedmann equation and
the equations of motion of each single ﬂuid to obtain a
set of diﬀerential equations that allows us to see the ex-
pansion of the universe as the solutions of a dynamical
autonomous system. The latter formalism will be used
to see whether there is any attractor behavior in the cos-
mological solutions.

The formalisms developed in the previous two sections
is applied to three particular examples in Sec. V. These
are: the actual standard cosmological model, also known
as the Concordance Model (CM); Einstein’s static model
of the universe; and a CM with an arbitrary component
of what we shall call dark energy.

Finally, Sec. VI is devoted to conclusions and general

comments.

II. MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND

We start with the so-called Cosmological Principle
(CP), ﬁrst proposed by Einstein, which states that the
universe we live in is homogeneous and isotropic in large

scales. By large scales we mean scales much larger than
the size of a typical galaxy.

The CP is a working hypothesis, and it is the sim-
plest assumption we can make about the properties of
the spacetime of the universe as a whole. The interested
reader can ﬁnd a more detailed discussion on the histor-
ical and philosophical relevance of Einstein’s CP in[6, 7].

A. Space geometry

The remarkable thing is that the CP suﬃces to ﬁx
the metric of the spacetime a homogeneous and isotropic
universe must have. It is called the Friedmann-Lemaitre-
Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, a metric with con-
stant curvature, whose line element is usually written as
(in units with c = 1)

dr2
kr2 + r2dΩ2

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν =

dt2 + a2(t)

−

(cid:21)
(1)
where the coordinate t is called the cosmic time, a(t) is
the (time-dependent) scale factor, and k is the curvature
constant.

−

(cid:20)

The spatial part of the metric is written in terms of co-
moving coordinates, as they remain ﬁxed as the universe
expands. Actually, the physical and comoving distances
at a given time t are related through xph = a(t)xcom.

Notice that dΩ is the usual spherical solid angle ele-
ment, and r is a comoving radial coordinate. In general,
for a ﬁxed r and t, we see that the circumference of a
circle is equal to C = 2πr, and the surface of a sphere is
S = 4πr2[8]. But, the proper radius of these objects, for
ﬁxed θ and ϕ, is given by

(2)
As a consequence, we see that for for k = 0, we recover
the usual Euclidean relations C/ℓ = 2π and S/ℓ2 = 4π.
However, if the curvature constant is positive k > 0, then
C/ℓ < 2π and S/ℓ2 < 4π. The opposite happens for
a negative curvature k < 0, and hence C/ℓ > 2π and
S/ℓ2 > 4π.

The expansion of the universe is encoded in the time
derivative (which we denote by a dot) of the scale factor,
with which one deﬁnes the Hubble parameter H
˙a/a,
named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble. Its impor-
tance comes from the fact that nearby galaxies recede
with a velocity proportional to their (physical) distance
from us, as v = Hxph[9, 10, 11].

of gravitation[6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 13, 14]. For this, we need to
specify the kind of matter the universe is made of, and
give its corresponding energy-momentum tensor. The
usual choice is that of a homogeneous and isotropic per-
fect ﬂuid, which is well described and deﬁned only by its
energy density ρ(t) and its isotropic pressure p(t).

There are two equations coming from GR, relating the
geometry and material contents of the universe, and there
is another equation coming from the conservation of the
energy-momentum tensor[6, 9, 12, 13, 14]. For a heuristic
approximations to the cosmological equations see[15, 16].

We have allowed for the existence in the universe of
more than one perfect ﬂuid; with the explicit restriction
that they do not interact with each other except gravita-
tionally. This means that each of the perfect ﬂuids obeys
a separate conservation equation, namely Eq. (3b).

C. Types of matter

Only (n + 1) of the above (n + 2) equations are in-
dependent, and we need (n) extra equations in order to
solve for the (2n + 1) unknowns a(t), ρi(t) and pi(t). The
needed equation is what is called an equation of state
relating the energy density and pressure of each perfect
ﬂuid. we will follow the common wisdom and assume a
barotropic equation of state in the form

where γi is the equation of state of the i-th ﬂuid. In this
case, Eq. (3b) integrates to

pi = (γi −

where ρi,0 is an integration constant. The most usual

think of curvature as a kind of special perfect ﬂuid with

(8)

The density parameter for the curvature component Ωk
is deﬁned together with the negative sign, so that it is on
equal footing with respect to the density parameters of
the material components[18, 19].

It can be seen from Eq. (7) that if the whole material
content of the universe equals the critical energy density,
ρi = ρc, then the curvature of the universe should
be zero; that is, it should correspond to a ﬂat universe.
P
Likewise, if
i ρi < ρc) then the universe
has a closed (open) spatial geometry.

i ρi > ρc (

The critical energy density depends on the value of the
Hubble parameter, and thus is a time-dependent quan-
tity. However, the current value of ρc,0 can be measured
directly from the redshift of nearby galaxies and other
objects, see[1, 20] for recent results.

On the other hand, each of the density parameters Ωi
shows the relative contribution of each type of matter to
the critical energy density at any time. The allowed range
for any density parameter is then 0
1, and Ωi = 1
means that the evolution of the universe is dominated by
the i-th ﬂuid. Whenever this happens we usually speak
of the i-th ﬂuid dominated era in the evolution of the
universe.

Also, Ωi,0 would represent the current relative contri-

and c) k = 1 for a closed (Spherical) universe[36]. For
further simplicity, one usually ﬁnds the suggestion of nor-
malizing the scale factor too, so that its actual value is
a0 = 1.

On the other hand, the curvature contributes to the
energy density of the universe, and the product kr2 in
metric (1) should be dimensionless. Thus, we have two
options.

•

Dimensionless k and r, and a scale factor a(t) with
dimensions of length. In this case, we can normal-
ize the curvature constant as mentioned above, but
we should notice then that the scale factor can-
not be normalized arbitrarily as its actual value
is set by the curvature density parameter as a0 =

the curvature constant is given by k =
Without loss of generality, we can choose to nor-
malize the scale factor as a0 = 1.

For convenience, the second option will be used through-
out this paper.

The constant of curvature is given, at any time, by
a2ΩkH 2. This is an interesting relation, since dH ≡
k =

1, which is called the Hubble length, provides us of
H −
an estimate of the size of the observable universe at any
time[6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14]. Hence, k tells us of the deviation
of the spatial part of metric (1) from the ﬂat case. For
scales r for which

can be considered to have an Euclidean space geometry.

The current value of the Hubble parameter is H0 =

size of our observable universe) is d0,H ≃
Also, the current value of curvature’s density parameter

larger than the distance to the farthest object we can

III. THE EFFECTIVE GRAVITATIONAL
POTENTIAL OF THE UNIVERSE

E. The curvature of the universe

There is a normalization issue about the curvature of
the universe we should be careful with. It is often said
that the curvature constant can be normalized to take
three diﬀerent values: a) k =
1, for an open (Hyper-
bolic) universe; b) k = 0, for a ﬂat (Euclidean) universe;

−

We will now present the ﬁrst method to describe the
expansion of the universe according to the type of matter
is made of. First, we notice that each energy density can
be given in terms of the actual value of its corresponding
3γi , see Eqs. (6)
density parameter as ρi = Ωi,0ρc,0 a−
and (8).

Second, the Friedmann equation (4) can be rewritten

in the form[6, 9, 12, 13]

is only the n-th ﬂuid which has γn < 2/3. Using the
condition V ′(ac) = 0 in Eq. (12a), we can write

where now a dot means derivative with respect to the
dimensionless time τ = H0t. The cosmic time is normal-

Eq. (9) resembles the conservation of energy for a par-
ticle with “space” coordinate a(t) and constant energy
(1/2)Ωk,0[39]. We see that a ﬂat universe has zero total
energy, and a closed (open) universe has negative (posi-
tive) total energy. Also, we would like to stress out that
the actual values of the density parameters are not all
independent, but are related through the Friedmann con-
straint at the present time,

All the terms inside the sum are positive by assumption;
therefore, V ′′(ac) < 0. The ﬁnal result is the same if
more than one ﬂuid have an equation of state γ < 2/3.
From this we conclude that any critical point corresponds
to a maximum.

IV. DYNAMICAL COSMOLOGICAL SYSTEM

In the presentation of the second method, we ﬁnd con-
venient to take the density parameters as the dynamical
variables themselves. It is then our purpose in this sec-
tion to show how to write the Einstein equations as a dy-
namical autonomous system (for a comprehensive read-
ing of such systems see[22]; and[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] for
applications in Cosmology).

cases the presence of at least one maximum in the po-

The existence of a critical point is not a trivial thing,
as it marks the value of the scale factor at which ¨a = 0,
since Eq. (10) is equivalent to the acceleration equation
¨a =
V ′(a). At a = ac, the acceleration of the uni-
verse’s expansion vanishes. Therefore, the existence of a
critical point tells us that the universe should have had a
decelerated and an accelerated expansion at some stages.
When does a critical point exist? From Eq. (12a), there
cannot be a critical point if all of the equations of state
γi > 2/3; the universe will always decelerate in such case.
In other words, it is necessary the presence of at least one
perfect ﬂuid with an equation of state with a value less
than 2/3 for the universe to have an accelerated expan-
sion.

Actually, it can be proved in the general case that if
there is a critical point ac such that V ′(ac) = 0, then
V ′′(ac) < 0. For this, let us assume that (n
1) matter
ﬂuids have an equation of state γi > 2/3, and that it

−

Let us assume that there are n+1 perfect ﬂuids present
in the universe. This is the most general case, as we have
already mentioned that the curvature itself can be seen as
a special perfect ﬂuid. The Friedmann constraint helps
us to reduce in one the number of independent variables,
i.e., it is only necessary to consider n perfect ﬂuids[40].

Choosing the (n + 1)-th perfect ﬂuid to be absorbed
by means of Eq. (7), the Einstein equations for the rest
of the n ﬂuids is given in terms of their corresponding
density parameters as

1. Exact solution

System (14) may appear redundant and unnecessary
at ﬁrst sight. This is because the behavior of the density
parameters as functions of the number of e-foldings N

can be easily found. By deﬁnition (see Eqs. (8)), the
exact solutions of Eqs. (14) are

(16)

where j = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1. It is not diﬃcult to verify that
Eqs. (14) directly follow from Eqs. (7) and (16).

P

If one only wants to know the evolution of the den-
sity parameters, then Eq. (16) suﬃces to know all of the
diﬀerent stages the universe has gone through during its
evolution. See sections below for some explicit examples.

B. Fixed points and stability analysis

However, the interesting thing to note is that Eq. (14)
is a dynamical autonomous system of the form x′ = f (x),
where x = (Ω1, Ω2, . . . , Ωn). In this respect, Eqs. (14)
can be seen as a complementary part of Eq. (9), since
the latter can tell us which attractor properties can be
found in the dynamical equations (3) and (4).

The critical (ﬁxed) points xc of the dynamical sys-
tem (14) are found by solving the equations f (xc) = 0.
There are two obvious solutions.

•

Trivial ((n+1)-th perfect ﬂuid dominated) solution,
for which xc = 0, Ωn+1 = 1, and then the expan-
sion of the universe is driven by the (n + 1)-th per-
fect ﬂuid. Eq. (15) points out that the universe
has an accelerated expansion, ¨a > 0, (decelerated
expansion, ¨a < 0) if γn+1 < 2/3 (γn+1 > 2/3).
There are two important remarks we should be
aware of at this point.

– If the (n + 1)-th perfect ﬂuid is the curvature,
then γn+1 = γk = 2/3, and then the universe
expands at a constant rate, i.e., ¨a = 0.
It
should be noticed, however, that the existence
of this critical point is forbidden by the Fried-
mann constraint (7) for the case of a closed
universe (if all of the density parameters are
positive deﬁnite).
On the other hand, this trivial solution is per-
mitted for an open universe, and is better
known as Milne’s universe[6, 12, 29].

– Milne’s model should be distinguished from
the so-called empty static model [12]. Eqs. (3)
tell us that an empty universe (no perfect ﬂuid
present, zero curvature) is indeed permitted,
which will remain static, a(t) = const.

•

for which
j-th perfect ﬂuid dominated solution,
Ωj = 1, and Ωi
=j = Ωn = 0; that is, the critical
points are xc,1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), xc,2 = (0, 1, . . . , 0),
etc. Eq. (15) again indicates that the universe will
accelerate (decelerate) its expansion if the domi-
nant equation of state is such that γj < 2/3 (γj >
2/3), which is the same conclusion we reached at
in the previous section.

5

(17)

Once found, the stability of the critical points can be
established by a ﬁrst order perturbation analysis[23], in
which one considers a small perturbation u in the form
x = xc + u. Hence, Eqs. (14) are linearized in the form
u′ =

u, where

have all negative
(positive) real parts, then the critical point is called stable
(unstable). If neither, it is then called a saddle point.

M

M

Back to our case, we have to solve the set of equa-
tions (14) for Ω′j = 0, and to study the eigenvalues of the
corresponding perturbation matrix. Let us suppose that
we want to investigate the stability of the ﬁxed point cor-
responding to the domination of the i
th perfect ﬂuid,
xc,i = (0, 0, . . . , Ωi = 1, . . . , 0).

−

After careful calculations, the elements of the pertur-

bation matrix are explicitly given by

Mjl = 3δjl (γi −

γj) + 3δji (γl −

γn+1) ,

(18)

where δjl is the Kronecker delta, δjl = 1 if j = l, and
δjl = 0 otherwise.
The matrix

is almost a diagonal matrix, except for
the non-zero elements in the row j = i; however, the
calculation of its eigenvalues is a simple matter. It can
be proved that the eigenvalues ωl are solutions to the
algebraic equation

M

[3 (γi −

−

ωl] = 0 ,

(19)

where l runs through the permitted (n+1) values, except
for the the particular value l = i, and then there are only
n eigenvalues.

In principle, the trivial critical point should be treated

separately, and the eigenvalue equation in this case is

Πn

l=1 [3 (γn+1

γl)

ωl] = 0 .

−
Naively, Eq. (20) seems to be a particular case of Eq. (19),
one in which i′ = n + 1. However, this is not formally so,
as the n + 1-th perfect ﬂuid does not appear in Eqs. (14).
Therefore, we come to the following general conclu-

−

(20)

sions.

•

•

•

The critical point corresponding to the domination
of the perfect ﬂuid with the largest equation of state
is unstable.

The critical point corresponding to the domination
of the perfect ﬂuid with the smallest equation of
state is stable.

All other critical points are saddle points.

The above statements directly follow from Eqs. (19)
and (20), as the positivity or negativity of the pertur-
bation eigenvalues for a particular case depend on the
relative value of the dominant equation of state with re-
spect to the others.

A. Our universe, or the Concordance Model

We now turn our attention to the so-called concordance
model (CM), also known as the ΛCDM (Lambda Cold
Dark Matter) model, the model of the universe the cos-
mological observations altogether seem to favor[1, 2, 21].
It contains radiation (relativistic particles), matter and
5, Ωm,0 =
vacuum energies in the proportions Ωr,0 = 10−
0.266, ΩΛ,0 = 0.732, and Ωk,0 = 0.01, respectively.
For numerical purposes, we take Ωr,0 = 10−

5, Ωm,0 =
0.3, ΩΛ,0 = 0.69, and Ωk,0 = 0.01, so that the Friedmann
constraint is accurately accomplished at the present time,
see Eq. (11).

The curvature of the universe is so small that one
hardly distinguishes our universe from the ’Flat’ case in
Fig. 1, and the maximum of the eﬀective gravitational
potential is negative, V (ac) < 0. These two facts imply
that the CM universe will never stop expanding, had a
past decelerating stage, and is currently accelerating its
expansion.

Notice that, keeping the radiation and matter present
contributions ﬁxed, the larger the vacuum contribution
is, the sooner the expansion starts accelerating.

2. Dynamical system

Explicitly, the dynamical system of the CM is

Ω′r = Ωr (2Ωr + Ωm −
Ω′m = Ωm (2Ωr + Ωm −
Ω′Λ = ΩΛ (2Ωr + Ωm −

The equations of state are γr > γm > γΛ, and thus we
conclude that radiation domination is an unstable point,
matter domination is a saddle point, and Λ domination
is the only stable point. The universe will always reach
a Λ dominated era at some epoch, and will remain in
it thereafter. We want to point out that this is true
whatever the actual contributions of each component are.
The evolution of the density parameters Ωj is also
shown in Fig 1. As discussed before, one can see the radi-
ation, the matter and the Λ dominated eras, but the cur-
vature dominated solution is never achieved, even though
its contribution is noticeable at the transition between
the matter and Λ dominated eras.

FIG. 2:
Eq. (21), for an Einstein’s static universe with Ωm,0 = 0.3,
ΩΛ,0 = 1.713, and Ωk,0 = −1.013; the critical point is at
ac = 0.44. The above values are determined from the con-

ditions V (ac) = (1/2)Ωk,0, V
(ac) = 0, and the Friedmann
constraint (11).

universe can expand even in the presence of a ﬁnely-tuned
cosmological constant.

B. Einstein’s static universe

2. Dynamical system

Originally, Einstein considered the universe as static,
and he introduced a cosmological constant to allow his
equations (3) to have a static solution. That is, Einstein
found a solution with ˙a = ¨a = 0. For an interesting
discussion on Einstein’s cosmological model see Chs. 2
and 4 in[6].

1. Eﬀective gravitational potential

According to Eqs. (9) and (12a), Einstein’s static so-
lution corresponds to a universe located at exactly the
critical point V ′(ac) = 0, for which V (ac) = (1/2)Ωk,0.
That is, the universe has just the enough total energy
to be at the critical point of its eﬀective gravitational
potential.

Unfortunately, we have already learned that the crit-
ical point of V (a) that Einstein found must be a max-
imum, and therefore is an unstable point. Hence, the
universe should expand or collapse, but cannot remain
static! An example of a static universe with density pa-
1.013 is
rameters Ωm,0 = 0.3, ΩΛ,0 = 1.713, Ωk,0 =
shown in Fig. 2.

−

Some time after Einstein proposed its static universe,
the expansion of the universe was discovered, and Ein-
stein thought he had made a mistake in introducing a cos-
mological constant to have a static universe; then called
the latter his ’biggest blunder’.

It took a bit longer for cosmologists to recognize that
Einstein’s original model is unstable[6, 30], and that the

The dynamical system analysis proposed in a previ-
ous section can, in principle, be applied to the Einstein’s
static universe. The conclusion is that the critical points
are the same as those of the concordance model, see Ta-
ble I and II. This is because the existence and nature of
the critical points only depend on the equations of state
of the material content of the universe.

However, Einstein’s universe is a case we have to deal
with carefully, because one cannot deﬁne a critical den-
sity at the maximum of the potential V (ac), since the
latter this time implies the vanishing of the Hubble pa-
rameter H.

C. Dark energy

Since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the
universe in the observations of Type Ia supernovae[1],
cosmologists have been wondering whether the energy
responsible for the acceleration is a cosmological constant
(γ = 0, ρΛ = const), or another exotic kind of matter,
usually dubbed dark energy, with an equation of state
= const (we
that lies in the range 2/3 > γX > 0 and ρX 6
shall use an X to denote dark energy quantities)[1, 2, 9].
For concreteness, we will next work on the case of a
CM universe in which vacuum energy is changed by a
dark energy component with a constant equation of state
γX = 1/3. It should be warned that this is not the most
general case of dark energy, but we consider a constant
γX for pedagogical reasons only.

CM universe in which the vacuum energy is replaced by a dark
energy component with equation of state γX = 1/3. (Bottom)
The corresponding evolution of the density parameters Ωj , see
Eqs. (16), as functions of the number of e-foldings N . As in
Fig. 1, there are radiation, matter and dark energy dominated
stages, without a curvature one. The dashed vertical line is
at the present value of the (normalized) scale factor a0 = 1
(N = 0) in both ﬁgures.

1. Eﬀective gravitational potential

The eﬀective gravitational potential and the evolution
of the density parameters are shown in Fig. 3. As in the
standard CM model, there is a maximum in the eﬀective
gravitational potential, but the behavior at late times
diﬀers from that of the CM. This time the maximum of
the potential is at ac ≃
Ωm,0/ΩX,0 = 0.65. That is,
it takes longer for this universe to have a dark energy
dominated, and then accelerated, stage than in the case
of a cosmological constant. This was to be expected, as
we mentioned before that a cosmological constant is an
extreme case for the equation of state of a perfect ﬂuid.

and the existence and nature of its critical points are

There is only one stable solution, which is the dark
energy dominated one. This will make the universe have
an accelerated expansion at late times. We see that the
model in this section is similar to the CM, but an accu-
rate enough measurement could in principle distinguish
between the two. So far, the CM seems to be the chosen
one, see[1, 2].

VI. FINAL COMMENTS

We stated at the beginning of this manuscript our in-
tention to understand the solutions of Einstein’s equa-
tions in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic universe.
After all of the mathematical work done in the previous
sections, we can extract some general conclusions on how
the expansion of the universe depend on its material con-
tent and curvature.

Assuming all of the energy densities in the universe are
positive deﬁnite, the eﬀective gravitational potential (10)
is negative deﬁnite. Therefore,

1. An open universe will expand for ever, irrespective
of the material content and of how large is its neg-
ative curvature. If there is a component with an
equation of state such that γ < 2/3, an open uni-
verse will enter an accelerated stage at late times.
Otherwise, it will decelerate but the expansion rate
will never vanish.

9

2. A ﬂat universe will always expand, and will accel-
erate its expansion if there is a component with an
equation of state such that γ < 2/3. Otherwise, the
expansion rate will asymptotically vanish ( ˙a
0 as
t

→

).

→ ∞

3. A closed universe will have an accelerated expan-
sion if there is a component with an equation of
state such that γ < 2/3, and if its curvature is such
that Ωk,0 < 2V (ac). If at least one of the previous
conditions is not accomplished, then the universe
will recollapse.

Some other comments are in turn. It was shown how
the dynamics of the universe can be studied using two
complementary approaches. For instance, the gravita-
tional potential method gave a clear proof of the insta-
bility of the Einstein’s static universe, whereas the dy-
namical system method revealed the stability nature of
the diﬀerent domination stages our universe has passed
through. It is our hope that the two methods revised in
this paper can help undergraduate students to deal with
the expansion of a homogeneous and isotropic universe.
Moreover, we would like to stress the fact that such

methods are taken seriously for the analysis of a great
variety of cosmological models. Already mentioned was
the use of the ’gravitational potential’ method in[12, 13,
31]. On the other hand, the use of dynamical systems
is widely known in the specialized literature; for a non-
exhaustive list of examples, see Refs.[23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28] and references there in.

In our opinion, it is important to teach undergraduate
students diﬀerent methods and techniques currently used
in specialized research. For we cannot say to what exten-
sion the methods presented in this work can be used and
generalized to other equations in Cosmology; but that we
shall know from the work of future cosmologists.

erties have not been fully exploited even though Eq. (9)
is indeed widely used as a serious research tool in the
specialized literature[31].

[40] If we think of the density parameters as the coordinates
of a n + 1-dimensional Cartesian space, the Friedmann
equation (7) then forces the universe to ’move’ on a par-

We present a simple method to determine the mutual inductance M between two coils in a coupled
AC circuit by using a digital dual-phase lock-in ampliﬁer. The frequency dependence of the real and
imaginary part is measured as the coupling constant is changed. The mutual inductance (M = kL)
decreases with increasing the distance d between the centers of coils. We show that the coupling
constant is proportional to d−n with an exponent n (≈ 3). When the current ﬂows in the coils,
the coil is magnetically regarded as the magnetic moment. The physics of the mutual inductance is
similar to that of two magnetic moments coupled by a dipole-dipole interaction.

INTRODUCTION

Faraday’s law of magnetic induction states that a
changing magnetic ﬂux through a coil of wire with re-
spect to time will induce an electromagnetic force (EMF)
in the wire.1 When two separate circuits can exchange
energy by means of magnetic induction, they are “cou-
pled.” In a coupled circuit, there are two coils of wire; a
primary coil that is connected in series with the voltage
source, and a secondary coil that is not connected to any
voltage source. The secondary coil receives energy only
In a transformer for example, energy is
by induction.
transferred from one circuit to another by means of mag-
netic coupling alone; the two circuits are not physically
connected by any wires. The EMF in the secondary coil
aﬀects the total voltage output of the coupled circuit due
to reﬂected impedance. Therefore changing the mutual
inductance has an aﬀect on the total voltage output.

The original AC coupled measurement is one of the
experiments in the Junior laboratory (undergraduate
course) in the Physics Department of our University. Stu-
dents spend a lot of time in measuring the frequency de-
pendence of the real part of output voltage when the dis-
tance between two coils is varied. In spite of their consid-
erable works, we ﬁnd that students have some diﬃculty
in getting well-deﬁned data and reasonable conclusions.
We realize that it is much easier for students to get good
data with the use of a digital dual-phase lock-in ampliﬁer
(Stanford Research System, SR850).2 It has the ability
to measure simultaneously the in-phase and out-of phase
signal.

Here we present a simple method to measure the fre-
quency dependence of the real part and imaginary part
of the output voltage across a resistance in the primary
circuit in the coupled AC circuit. The change in distance
of two coils facing each other leads to the change of the
mutual inductance. The present method allows one to
obtain a great deal of data in a reasonably short period
of time. Also, previously undeterminable features of the
circuit become available when it is combined with the
lock-in ampliﬁer. A background for the AC analysis of

the AC coupled circuit in the frequency domain is pre-
sented in Sec. III. The frequency dependence of the real
part and imaginary part of output voltage is formulated
and is simulated using the Mathematica. Our results are
reported in Sec. IV. The mutual inductance is deter-
mined as a function of the distance between the centers
of two coils from the frequency dependence of the real
and imaginary parts. We show that the mutual induc-
tance changes with the distance d as d−n where n
3.
We show that the physics of the mutual inductance is the
same as that of magnetic moments which are coupled by
a dipole-dipole interaction.

II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

−

The AC coupled circuit in the frequency domain was
conﬁgured in Fig. 1(a). An AC voltage was sent into
1, ˜E is
the circuit, vs(t) = Re[ ˜Eejωt], where j = √
the complex voltage source, and w (= 2πf ) is the an-
gular frequency. Two LCR circuits are placed together
with inductors, resistors and capacitors attempting to
be equivalent (L1 = L2 = 0.821 H, R1 = R2 = 97
Ω, and C = 0.0038 µF), where the resistance of each
coil is 66.0 Ω. The resonance frequency f0 is equal to
f0 = 1/(2π√LC) = 2850 Hz. In Fig. 1(b) we show the
overview of two coils used in the present measurement.
Each coil (Heath Compamy Part No. 40-694) has a cylin-
drical form with the inner diameter (9.30 cm), the outer
diameter (12.5 cm), and the length (9.0 cm). The number
of turns of the coil is N = 3400. The minimum distance
between the centers of the coils is dc = 10.2 cm. The
total distance is d = dc + ds, where ds is the separation
distance between the edges of the two coils. The two
inductors are placed on a meter long track.

A digital dual-phase

(Stanford
SR850) was used to ﬁnd the real part (µ) and imagi-
nary part (ν) of the output voltage across the resistance

used in place of the inductors L1 and L2. The resistances (R1

where ˜E = E0ejφ0 and φ0 is the phase. The in-phase
component of the lock-in ampliﬁer is equal to E0µ and
the out-of phase component is equal to E0ν, where
E0 = 4.97 mV. So one can determine the values of real
part µ and imaginary part ν of the output voltage, inde-
pendently. The digital dual-phase lock-in ampliﬁer has
a frequency sweep feature so that it will measure across
a certain frequency range. The measurements are re-
peated for numerous distances ranging from 10.2 cm to
70.2 cm. The frequency range initially is 2500 Hz to
3500 Hz, but after 25.2 cm separation the frequency scan
is only needed to be across 2700 Hz - 3000 Hz.

between the centers of two coils (see Fig. 1(b)) is the dis-
tance d. The number of turns of the coils 1 and 2 is the
same (N ). The magnetic ﬁeld produced by coil 1 (current
I1) at the center of coil 2 is given by

cal form with a radius Rav and a lengh l. The separation

This value of Lcal is a little larger than the actual value of
Lexp (= 0.821 H). The diﬀerence between Lexp and Lcal is
due to the deviation of the system from ideal one: Lexp =
KLcal, where K is called the Nagaoka coeﬃcient.3 The

Numerical calculations of µ and ν were made using

simulated plots of the real part (µ) and the imaginary

changed as a parameter: k = 0 - 0.1. In Fig. 3(a), the
double peaks in the µ vs x curve are symmetric with
respect to x = 1 and becomes closer and closer together as
k is decreased and becomes a single peak at kQ
0.5757.
The imaginary part ν (see Fig. 3(b)) has a positive local
minimum at x = 0.9967 and a negative local maximum

a parameter: k = 0 - 0.1. There is a drastic change of the
trajectory from the state-I and state-II at kQ = 1, when
kQ is decreased. For k = 0, the trajectory is a circle of
radius 1/2 centered at µ = 1/2 and ν = 0.

IV. RESULT

We have measured the frequency dependence of the
real part µ and the imaginary part ν when the distance
d between the centers of two coils is changed as a param-
eter: d = 10.2 - 70.2 cm. Our results are shown in Figs. 4

of x (= f /f0), where f0 = 2850 Hz and Q = 151.5. In
Figs. 4(a) and (b) double peaks of µ becomes closer and
closer when d is increased and the double peaks becomes
a single peak around d = 36.2 cm. The double peaks
are not symmetric with respect x = 1. The peak at the
lower-x side is higher than that at the higher-x side. The
real part has a local minimum at x which is a little larger
than 1. In Fig. 5(a) and (b) the imaginary part ν crosses

Figure 7(b) shows the normalized peak frequencies of
the real part (µ) as a function of the distance d (cm),
where xd = fd/f0 (< 1), xu = fu/f0 (> 1), and f0 =
2850 Hz. The real part µ takes double peaks at the lower
and upper frequencies fd and fu for d < 30 cm. The d
dependence of xu and xd is similar to that of x1 and x2,
respectively. In Fig. 7(b) we also show the normalized
frequency deﬁned by (xuxd)1/2 as a function of d. This
frequency decreases with increasing d like (x1x2)1/2 in
Fig. 7(a).

V. DISCUSSION

First we show that from a view point of physics, the AC
coupled circuit with the mutual inductance is equivalent
to the magnetic moments ˜M1 (= µ0N I1A) for the coil
1 and ˜M2 (= µ0N I2A) for the coil 2. They are coupled
with a dipole-dipole interaction deﬁned by

the prediction that the real part (µ) is equal to 1/[1+(kQ)2] at
x = 1 for the symmetrical conﬁguration (L1 = L2). The best
ﬁtted curve to the expression given by Eq.(22) is denoted by a
solid line. (b) The values of k are derived from the prediction
that x1 and x2 are described by Eqs.(17) and (18). The values
of k are numerically solved for each d. The best ﬁtted curves
are shown by the dotted and solid lines in the ﬁgure.

From the deﬁnition of the mutual inductance M , the in-
teraction energy ˜U12 can be described by ˜U12 =
M I1I2,
leading to the mutual inductance which is the same as
Eq.(4) derived from the Faraday’s law.

It is predicted that the parameter k changes with the
distance a according to Eq.(6); k is proportional to d−3.
The ﬁrst method to determine the parameter k as a func-
tion of the distance d, is as follows. As shown in Sec. III,
it is predicted that in the symmetrical conﬁguration
(L1 = L2 = L), the real part µ takes a µ = 1/[1 + (kQ)2]
at x = 1. Note that the imaginary part ν is equal to zero
at x = 1. Experimentally we have determine the value
of µ at x = 1 as a function of d. The values of k are de-
rived from the above expression with Q = 151.5. Figure
8(a) show the plot of k vs d thus obtained. The value
of k drastically decreases with increasing d and almost

5.0 and the exponent n =
yields a constant ζ = 38.5
0.05, where d is in the units of cm. The value
2.60
of ζ is rather diﬀerent from the predicted value for the
present coils (ζ = 151.5), while the value of n is rather
close to the predicted value (n = 3). The large deviation
of the experimental value of ζ from our prediction may
be related to the asymmetric conﬁguration of L1 and L2
in the present system, where L2 is slightly lower than L1
(which will be discussed later). As shown in Fig. 4(a),
the value of x where the real part µ has a local minimum

is not equal to x = 1, and shifts to the high-x side.

The second method to determine the value of k is as
follows.
In Sec. III, it is predicted that the imaginary
part ν takes zero-crossing at x = x2, 1, and x1 in the
case of the symmetrical conﬁguration (L1 = L2 = L).
Note that the imaginary part ν is not always equal to
zero at x = 1 partly because of the asymmetric conﬁg-
uration in the present experiment. The value of k for
each d is derived by applying the Mathematica program
called FindRoot to Eq.(17) with the experimental value
of x2 and to Eq.(18) with the experimental value of x1
(see Fig. 7(a)), since Eqs.(17) and (18) are complicated
functions of k. In Fig. 8(a) we show the value of k as a
function of d thus obtained. The value of k drastically de-
creases with increasing d. The value of k is a little larger
than those obtained from the ﬁrst method at the same
d. The least-squares ﬁt of the data of k vs d to Eq.(22)
0.05
yields the parameters ζ = 57.1
for x1 and ζ = 149
0.09 for x2. The
latter result is in excellent agreement with the prediction
(ζ = 151.5 and n = 3.0). In spite of such diﬀerent val-
ues of ζ, it may be concluded experimentally that two
magnetic moments made from coils are coupled through
the dipole-dipole interaction with the exponent n being
equal to 3.

Finally we discuss the eﬀect of the asymmetric conﬁg-
uration on the trajectory in the (µ,ν) plane. As shown
in Fig. 6, the trajectory rotates clockwise compared to
the case of the trajectory in the symmetric conﬁguration.
Figure 9(a) shows the simulation plot of the µ as a func-
tion of x for the asymmetric conﬁguration (L1 = 0.8201
H and L2 = 0.8215 H) as k is changed as a parameter,
where Q = 151.5. Double peaks of µ around x = 1 is
not symmetric with respect to x = 1. The peak at the
high-x side is higher than that at the low-x side. Double
peaks become closer and closer as k is decreased. Figure
9(b) shows the simulation plot of the trajectory in the
(µ,ν) plane under the same condition as Fig. 9(a). The
trajectory rotates counterclockwise compared to the case
of the trajectory in the symmetric conﬁguration. Figures
10(a) and (b) show the simulation plot of µ as a function
of x and the trajectory in the (µ,ν) plane for the asym-
metric conﬁguration (L1 = 0.8201 H and L2 = 0.8198
H), where Q = 151.5 and k is changed as a parameter.
Double peaks of µ around x = 1 is not symmetric with re-
spect to x = 1. The peak at the high-x side is lower than
that at the low-x side. The trajectory rotates clockwise
compared to the case of the trajectory in the symmetric
conﬁguration. These features are in good agreement with
those observed in the present measurement (see Fig. 5(a)
for the µ vs x curve and Fig. 6 for the trajectory). So
we can conclude that L1 is a little larger than L2, which
means the asymmetric conﬁguration for the present mea-
surement.

VI. COCLUSION

We present a simple method for determining the mu-
tual inductance of the AC coupled circuit using a digital
dual-phase lock-in ampliﬁer. This method allows one to
get a large amount of data on the frequency dependence
of the real and imaginary part of the AC output volt-
age in a reasonably short time. Our experimental results
show that the coupling constant of the two coils is pro-
portional to d−n with an exponent n (
3), where d is the
distance between the centers of coils. When the current
ﬂows in the coils, the coil is magnetically regarded as the
magnetic moment. So the physics of the mutual induc-

≈

tance is similar to that of two magnetic moments coupled
each other. We ﬁnd that the interaction between these
two magnetic moments is a dipole-dipole interaction.

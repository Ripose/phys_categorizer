Abstract

An analysis is performed of the role played by physical intuition in expressing the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld in terms of its sources in the time-dependent case. The conclusion is that it is
dangerous to dissociate physical intuition from the mathematical description of the phenom-
ena.

Intuition is an element of paramount importance for the construction of physical theories and
the solution of physical problems. In the case of electrodynamics, the ﬁniteness of the speed of
propagation of electromagnetic inﬂuences plays a crucial role in our understanding of electromag-
netic phenomena.

The standard argument for the retarded potentials runs as follows. Consider the contribution
to the potential at point r from the charges and currents in the volume element dτ ′ about point
r′. Since electromagnetic inﬂuences travel at speed c, the potentials at r at time t must have
originated in the charges and currents present in dτ ′ at an instant tr previous to t, so providing
electromagnetic inﬂuences with the time interval t − tr to propagate from r′ to r . The distance
between r and r′
is the magnitude of the vector R = r − r′, that is, R = |r − r′|. Thus, the
retarded time tr is determined by c(t − tr) = R, or

tr = t −

Physical intuition suggests that the potentials be given in terms of their sources by the same
expressions valid in electrostatics and magnetostatics except for the replacement of the charge
and current densities by their values at the retarded time. One is led, therefore, to introduce the
retarded potentials

Straightforward computations [1] show that the retarded potentials satisfy their corresponding
inhomogeneous wave equations and meet the Lorentz condition. The ﬁelds are found from the
retarded potentials by means of

E = −∇V −

, B = ∇ × A ,

and a direct calculation [1] yields

These equations, in which ˆR = R/R and the dot means partial derivative with respect to time,
are time-dependent generalizations of the Coulomb and Biot-Savart laws and appear to have been
ﬁrst published by Jeﬁmenko in 1966, in the ﬁrst edition of his textbook [3]. These equations have
been shown [4] to be equivalent to other seemingly diﬀerent equations derived by Panofsky and
Phillips [5].

It is often emphasized [1, 2] that the same “logic” that worked for the potentials leads to wrong
answers for the ﬁelds. Indeed, as Griﬃths [1] remarks, “to get the retarded potentials, all you have
to do is replace t by tr in the electrostatic and magnetostatic formulas, but in the case of the ﬁelds
not only is time replaced by retarded time, but completely new terms (involving derivatives of ρ
and J) appear.” This state of aﬀairs has been called a conundrum by McDonald [4]. Saying, as
he does, that the conundrum is resolved by radiation is hardly a satisfying explanation of why
intuition seems to have betrayed us in the case of the ﬁelds.

Let us take a closer look at the origin of our intuition about the potentials. In the Lorentz

gauge the scalar and vector potentials obey the inhomogeneous wave equation

∇2φ(r, t) −

= −f (r, t) .

∂2φ(r, t)
∂t2
Outside the sources, that is, wherever f (r, t) = 0, the potential φ obeys the homogeneous wave
equation, and φ travels at speed c. But the potential that propagates in vacuum emanates from
the sources, which leads us to believe that the propagation of the inﬂuence from the cause (source)
to produce the eﬀect (potential) takes place at speed c. Thus, the state of the potential at the
present time must depend on the state of the sources at the past instant when electromagnetic
“information” left them. This expectation derives from the fact that, outside the sources, the
potential satisﬁes the homogeneous wave equation, whose solutions are known to travel at speed
c. Therefore, coherence demands that in order to apply the same physical intuition to the ﬁelds
one must search for equations of the form (6) for E and B.

From Maxwell’s equations, with the help of the identity ∇ × (∇ × A) = ∇(∇ · A) − ∇2A,

one easily gets

Now the same heuristic argument invoked to justify the retarded potentials suggests that

(∇ρ)(r′, tr) denotes the gradient of ρ(r, t), calculated

One must be careful with the notation:
keeping t ﬁxed, evaluated at r = r′ and t = tr ; the same goes for (∇ × J)(r′, tr).

The above expressions for E and B are not new [6].

It is not obvious that these ﬁelds
satisfy all of Maxwell’s equations, since they are solutions to second order equations, whereas
Maxwell’s equations are of the ﬁrst order. In Lorrain and Corson [6] the proof that these ﬁelds
coincide with those obtained from the retarded potentials is left to the reader, who is asked to
neglect retardation. Here we show directly that equations (9) and (10) are completely equivalent
to Jeﬁmenko’s equations (4) and (5).

Consider the gradient of ρ(r′, tr) with respect to r′ but now taking into account both the

explicit and the implicit dependences:

∇′ρ(r′, tr) = (∇ρ)(r′, tr) +

∇′tr = (∇ρ)(r′, tr) +

where we used ∇′R = − ˆR and ∂tr/∂t = 1. Making use of (11) and recalling that µ0ǫ0 = 1/c2,
equation (9) can be recast as

Physical intuition has not led us astray, after all. In spite of its fallibility, physical intuition
is invaluable in the investigation of physical phenomena. The situation here discussed reveals,
however, that the appeal to intuitive arguments requires caution. In particular, it is not possible
or, at least, it is dangerous to dissociate the physical intuition from the mathematical description
of the phenomena.

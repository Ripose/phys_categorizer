Abstract. A set of examples is provided that illustrate the use of work as applied to
simple machines. The ramp, pulley, lever and hydraulic press are common experiences
in the life of a student and their theoretical analysis therefore makes the abstract
concept of work more real. The mechanical advantage of each of these systems is also
discussed so that students can evaluate their usefulness as machines.

Working with simple machines

1. Introduction

2

The Work-Energy theorem (discussed in detail below) is one of the most important
ideas in classical mechanics, and is often discussed in high school physics courses and
university level freshman physics classes. Nevertheless, the reason for deﬁning work as
force times distance often remains obscure to the student. And the idea that work is
conserved (in the absence of dissipative forces), in that a smaller force implies that the
distance must be larger in order to obtain the same work (and thus impart the same
energy to an object), is often lost on students. On the other hand, simple machines
are often studied in elementary school science classes. These students get to experience
how machines can amplify forces. For instance with a simple lever, the students can lift
weights that would otherwise be impossible. Usually what is emphasized in the study
of simple machines is the idea of mechanical advantage, or force ampliﬁcation. This is
ﬁne and students learn from it. However rarely is the idea of work emphasized in the
study of simple machines. The idea of the present article is to emphasize the constancy
of work in the use of simple machines. The aim is twofold. Firstly, it is hoped that after
going through the exercises below, high school and university level physics students will
have a much clearer understanding as to why work is deﬁned as force times distance.
Simple machines will be used to illustrate the deﬁnition of work. Secondly, it is hoped
that in the study of simple machines in elementary school, more attention will be paid
to the idea of work. Work will be used to illustrate the use of simple machines.

The outline of the article is as follows. Four diﬀerent types of simple machines
(ramp, pulley, lever, hydraulic press) will be studied.
In each case it will be shown
explicitly that if less force is applied then a corresponding greater moving distance is
involved such that the work (or eﬀort) always remains the same, and correspondingly
therefore the energy imparted is the same. The theme will be less force, more distance,
same work. (Or if you like one can say more force, less distance, same work.) A good set
of references on simple machines is provided [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. One of the
best is the book by Lehrman [4]. There are also some good sources for elementary school
teachers [1, 2, 3] and high school and university teachers [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

1.1. Work-Energy theorem

The force approach to the study of mechanics is to identify all the forces, divide by
mass to get acceleration and then solve for velocity, displacement, time, etc. There
is an alternative formulation of mechanics which does not rely heavily on force, but
rather is based on the concepts of work and energy. The work-energy formulation of
mechanics [13] is worthwhile since sometimes it is easier to use and involves only scalar
quantities. Also it leads to a better physical understanding of mechanics. However
the key reason for introducing work-energy is because energy is conserved. This great
discovery simpliﬁed a great deal of physics. The basic concept of work is that it is force
times distance. You do work on an object by applying a force over a certain distance.
When you lift an object you apply a lifting force over the height that you lift the object.

Machines are devices that allow us to do work more eﬃciently. For example, a ramp
is what is called a simple machine. If you load objects into a truck, then a large ramp
(large distance) allows you to apply less force to achieve the same work. Actually the
proper physical deﬁnition of work is more complicated than simply force times distance.
The proper deﬁnition is W ≡
F · dr. Consider the 1-dimensional case. If the force
rf

Fx is constant then it can be taken outside the integral to give

W ≡ Fx Z

dx = Fx∆x = force × distance

where ∆x ≡ xf − xi. Using F = ma, and in the 1-dimensional case

where Kinetic Energy is deﬁned as K ≡ 1
2mv2. Thus the total work is always equal to
the change in kinetic energy. Now recognize that there are two types of forces called
conservative and non-conservative. To put it brieﬂy, conservative forces “bounce back”
and non-conservative forces don’t. Gravity is a conservative force. If you lift an object
against gravity and let it go then the object falls back to where it began. Spring forces
are conservative. If you pull a spring and then let it go, it bounces back to where it
was. However friction is non-conservative. If you slide an object along the table against
friction and let go, then the object just stays there. With conservative forces we always
associate a potential energy. Thus any force F can be broken up into the conservative
piece FC and the non-conservative piece FN C, as in

W ≡

F · dr =

FC · dr +

FN C · dr ≡ WC + WN C

(3)

and each piece corresponds therefore to conservative work WC and non-conservative
work WN C. Deﬁne the conservative piece as the negative of the change in a new quantity
called potential energy U and WC ≡ −∆U, giving the Work-Energy theorem,

∆U + ∆K = WN C

(4)

If the non-conservative work is zero then we have conservation of total mechanical energy
∆E = 0, with E ≡ U + K.

2. Ramp

The ramp (or inclined plane) is shown in Figure 1, where h is the height of the ramp
and s is the distance along the ramp. A weight exerts a vertical force mg. For an
elementary science class two ramps can be constructed in which the distance s of one
ramp is double the distance of the other. However both ramps should have the same
vertical distance h. An example might be loading furniture into a truck and choosing a
ramp to make the job easier. Students can be asked to push the weight up both ramps.
(It is essential to put the weight on wheels so that friction is minimized.) Thus the
students will be pushing the weight through the distance s. The force that the students
will have to overcome is then mgsinθ. See Figure 1.

Figure 1. Ramp.

The essential idea for elementary school students to understand is the following.
For a long ramp students will notice that the weight is easier to push. Nevertheless they
will be pushing over a correspondingly greater distance and at the end of pushing the
weight up both ramps, they will have expended the same eﬀort. That is their work is
the same. The ﬁnal potential energy (mgh) of the weight is the same. Less force, more
distance, same work.

High school and university students can also work this result out mathematically

as follows. The distance up the ramp is
h
sinθ

s =

which is large for small angles. The pushing force (see Figure 1) is

F = mgsinθ

which is small for small angles. Thus ramps are easy to use when the angle is small.
The product of force and distance is

F s = mgsinθ

= mgh.

h
sinθ

Thus for both ramps the product F s is the same. This clearly shows that you can’t get
something for nothing. Less force, more distance, same work. Students should now have
a clear grasp as to why the work (or eﬀort) is deﬁned as force times distance. It makes
sense with the intuitive idea experienced in actually pushing the weight up the two
diﬀerent ramps. The eﬀort expended in both cases was the same and this is embodied
in the deﬁnition of work. (Note that of course work is really deﬁned as the integral of
the scalar product of force and displacement. This complication is not discussed in this
article as the main idea is to develop intuition about the concept of work.) Most books
which discuss simple machines emphasize mechanical advantage rather than work. For
completeness, the mechanical advantage (MA) is deﬁned as the load force divided by
the input force or

Thus a long ramp (large s) gives a large mechanical advantage.

3. Pulley

Next consider some pulley systems as shown in Figure 2. For simplicity only consider
a single and double pulley. These will be suﬃcient to illustrate the main idea. Imagine
that the weight is pulled with a force F at constant speed so that the acceleration is
zero. Applying F = ma to the weight gives T − mg = 0 where T is the tension. Thus
the pulling force F equals T and

The rope in the pulley is pulled through a distance s. If the weight is to be raised by a
height h then obviously

Now consider the two pulley system in Figure 2. Again applying F = ma to the weight
gives 2T − mg = 0 or T = mg

2 giving

Now by looking at Figure 2 it can be seen that if the rope is pulled through a distance
of s then the weight will only be raised by h = s

2. Thus now

Thus for the double pulley, it’s twice as easy to lift the weight, but one has to pull
double the distance to raise the weight the same height. By actually using these pulley
systems the students can experience this for themselves.

The product of force and distance however remains the same.

Less force, more distance, same work. Elementary school students can simply experience
this for themselves by using the two pulley systems. High school and university students
can do the calculations to show explicitly that the product F s remains the same and
thus is good for a deﬁnition of work.

Figure 3. Lever.

4. Lever

The lever is another famous simple machine and is shown in Figure 3. In the top part
of the ﬁgure, a lever is shown in the horizontal position and one imagines that a person
is pushing down with the force F to hold a weight mg in balance. This will be the case
no matter what is the orientation of the lever. We will ignore the weight of the lever
and imagine that we have a lever made of a very light material that does not bend. For
static equilibrium the torques produced by both forces must be the same, τ1 = τ2 giving
mga = F b or

Thus only a small pushing force F is needed if the lever arm b is large. This is something
easily demonstrated to students. However if one is to use the lever to lift the weight,
then the longer the lever arm, the larger the distance s one will have to lift through.
This is seen in the bottom part of Figure 3. From the ﬁgure θ = h
b where h is
the distance the object is to be lifted. The distance that the lever arm will have to be
moved through is

a = s

F = mg

showing that if the lever arm b is large (small force) the distance s must be large. All
students can experience this using the lever. The point is though that the product of
force and distance will always be the same,

F s = mg

h

= mgh.

Once again, elementary school students can use the lever , change the length of the lever
arm and notice that even though it’s easier to lift, they have to lift through a larger
distance s and their work, or eﬀort, remains the same. High school and university
students can demonstrate mathematically that the work remains the same. Again we
have the principle of less force, more distance, same work.

The mechanical advantage is

5. Hydraulic Press

Finally the hydraulic press can also be used to demonstrate these ideas. The press is
shown in Figure 4. The pressure P is deﬁned as
P ressure ≡ F orce

but the pressure throughout the ﬂuid is the same. Thus

giving the applied force as

F =

which shows that for a large area A2 then only a small force F need be applied. However
from Figure 4 it can be seen that if A2 is large then the weight mg will only be lifted a
small distance h. This can be seen mathematically. The volume change ∆V will be the
same,

∆V = A1s = A2h

giving

s =

A2
A1

h

showing that if A2 is large (small force needed) then the distance s over which the force
must be applied will have to be large. Students can experience this by using two diﬀerent
hydraulic presses with diﬀerent areas A2. The work is always the same. Mathematically
this is seen from

F s =

In this section we have assumed an idealised hydraulic press. However in reality
frictional eﬀects can be rather large and this will make the mechanical advantage smaller
than the ideal case.

6. Conclusion

The simple machines consisting of a ramp, pulley, lever and hydraulic press are found
in everyday life. Their mathematical analysis makes the concept of work much clearer
to students encountering the subject for the ﬁrst time. These machines can be easily
constructed and used as demonstrations in the classroom, which makes them doubly
eﬀective for learning. When students interact with these demonstrations they can easily
experience the concept of mechanical advantage which has been presented in this paper.
Both demonstrations and the analysis of this paper, make simple machines an excellent
way for students to learn about work.

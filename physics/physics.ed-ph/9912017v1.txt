Abstract

We obtain the Casimir eﬀect for the massless scalar ﬁeld in one
dimension based on the analogy between the quantum ﬁeld and the
continuum limit of an inﬁnite set of coupled harmonical oscillators.

1 Introduction

A well known fact in quantum mechanics is that, even though the classical
system admits a zero minimal energy, this does not generally hold for its
quantum counterpart. The typical example is the 1
2 ¯hω value for the non-
relativistic harmonic linear oscillator, where ¯h is the Planck constant and ω
its proper frequency. More generally, if the system behaves as a collection of
such oscillators, the minimal (or zero point) energy is

E0 =

ωn,

where the sum extends over all proper frequencies ωn. As often pointed out
in quantum ﬁeld theory textbooks1,2, non-interacting quantized ﬁelds can be
pictured this way, in the limit of an inﬁnite spatial density of oscillators. In
particular, for the scalar ﬁeld the analogy with a set of coupled oscillators
can be constructed in a precise manner1, as we shall also sketch below. We
shall use here the oscillator model to obtain the Casimir eﬀect for the massless
ﬁeld, in the case of one spatial dimension. The calculation is a simple exercise
in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.

What is usually refered to as the Casimir eﬀect3 is the attraction force be-
tween two conducting parallel uncharged plates in vacuum. The phenomenon
counts as a direct evidence for the zero point energy of the quantized elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld: assuming the plates are perfect conductors, the energy to
area ratio reads1 (c is the speed of light and L is the plates separation)

from which the attraction force can be readily derived. Qualitatively, the L
dependence in E0 is naturally understood as originating in that displayed by
the proper frequencies of the ﬁeld between the plates.

Actually, by summing over frequencies as in eq. (1) one obtains a di-
vergent energy. This is a common situation in quantum ﬁeld theory, being
remedied by what is called renormalization: one basically subtracts a di-
vergent quantity to render the result ﬁnite, with the justiﬁcation that only
energy dif f erences are relevanta. Unfortunately, computational methods
used to handle inﬁnities to enforce this operationb present themselves, rather
generally, as a piece of technicality with no intuitive support; for the unac-
customed reader, they might very well leave the impression that the result
is just a mathematical artifact. The oscillator analogy comes to provide a
context to do the calculations within a physically transparent picture, with
no extra mathematical input required.

2 Quantum ﬁeld theory calculation

We brieﬂy review ﬁrst the ﬁeld theoretical approach. Consider the uncharged
massless scalar ﬁeld in one dimension −∞ < x < ∞,

subjected to the conditions

!

ϕ(x, t) = 0,

ϕ(0, t) = ϕ(L, t) = 0

for some positive L. We are interested in the zero point energy as a function
of L. We shall focus on the ﬁeld in the “box” 0 < x < L. It is intuitively
clear that the result for the exterior regions follows by making L → ∞. Note
that by eqs. (4) the ﬁeld in the box is causally disconnected from that in the
exterior regions, paralleling thus the situation for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
in the previous chapter.

Eqs. (3) and (4) deﬁne the proper frequencies as

ωn =

, n = 1, 2, . . . ∞,

nπ
L

obviously making E0 a divergent quantity. A convenient way5 to deal with
this is by introducing the damping factors

ωn → ωn exp(−λωn/c),

λ > 0,

and to consider E0 = E0(L, λ) in the limit λ → 0. Performing the sum one
obtains

E0(L, λ) =

Now, it is immediate to see that the λ−2 term can be assigned to an inﬁnite
energy density corresponding to the case L → ∞. The simple but essential
observation is that, when considering also the energy of the exterior regions,
the divergences add to an L-independent quantity, which makes them me-
chanically irrelevant. Renormalization amounts to ignore them. Thus one
can set

E0(L) = −

which stands as the analogous result of eq. (2).

lators described by the Hamiltonian (all notations are conventional)

xk measures the displacement of the kth oscillator from its equilibrium po-
sition, supposed equally spaced from the neighbored ones by distance a.

Let us consider the parameters m and k scaled such that

As familiar from wave propagation theory in elastic media, eq. (13) becomes
the d’Alembert equation (3) with the correspondence

and letting a → 0. xk, pm commutations can be also shown to trans-
late into the equal-time ﬁeld variables commutations required by canonical
quantization1. One can thus identify the quantum ﬁeld with the continuum
limit of the quantum mechanical system.

Our interest lies in the oscillator analogy when taking into account con-
ditions (4). It is transparent from eq. (15) that they formally amount to set
in H

x0 = xN = 0,

p0 = pN = 0,

(16)

with N some natural number. In other words, the 0th and the Nth oscillator
are supposed ﬁxed. As in the precedent paragraph, we shall calculate the
zero point energy of the oscillators in the “box” 1 ≤ k ≤ N − 1.

The ﬁrst step is to decouple the oscillators by diagonalizing the quadrat-
ical form in coordinates in eq. (11). Equivalently, one needs the eigenvalues
λn of the N − 1 dimensional square matrix Vkm with elements

Vk,k = 2,

Vk,k+1 = Vk,k−1 = −1,

and zero in rest. One easily checks they are

λn = 4 sin2 nπ

with λn corresponding to the (unnormalized) eigenvectors xn,k = sin nk

To make connection with the continuous picture, we assign to the system the
length

measuring the distance between the ﬁxed oscillators, and eliminate N in
favour of a and L in eq. (19). After summing the series one obtains

The result is essentially the same with that in eq. (9). The a independent
term reproduces the renormalized value (10). An identical comment applies
to the a → 0 diverging terms. Note that the L → ∞ energy density can be
equally obtained by making N → ∞ in eq. (19) and evaluating the sum as an
integral. Physically put, this corresponds to an inﬁnite crystal with vibration
modes characterized by a continuous quasimomentum in the Brillouin zone

Note also that the second term, with no correspondent in eq. (9), can be
absorbed into the ﬁrst one with an irrelevant readjustment of the box length

4 Quantum ﬁeld vs oscillator model: quanti-

tative comparison and a speculation

Let us deﬁne for a > 0 the subtracted energy ES
between E0(L, a) and the paranthesis in eq. (23), so that

0 (L, a) as the diﬀerence

0 (L, a) = E0(L).

One may ask when the oscillator model provides a good approximation for
the quantum ﬁeld, in the sense that

is close to unity. Note that by eq. (20) expression above is a function of
N only. The corresponding dependence is plotted in Fig.1. One sees, quite
surprisingly, that already a number of around twenty oscillators suﬃces to
assure a relative diﬀerence smaller than 10−4. More precisely, one has that
the curve assymptotically approaches zero as

N 2 .
We end with a bit of speculation. Suppose there exists some privileged
scale l (say, the Plank scale) which imposes a universal bound for lengths
measurements, and consider the oscillator system with the spacing given by
l. The indeterminacy in L will cause an indeterminacy in energy (we assume
L ≫ l)

(28)

On the other hand, the assymptotic expression (28) implies

We are led thus to the conclusion that, as far as Casimir eﬀect measurements
are considered, one could not distinguish between the “real” quantum ﬁeld
and its oscillator model.

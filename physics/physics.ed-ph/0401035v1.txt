A Didactic Approach to Linear Waves in the Ocean

F. J. Beron-Veraa)
RSMAS/AMP, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33149
(Dated: July 22, 2013)

The general equations of motion for ocean dynamics are presented and the waves supported
by the (inviscid, unforced) linearized system with respect to a state of rest are derived. The
linearized dynamics sustains one zero frequency mode (called buoyancy mode) in which salinity and
temperature rearrange in such a way that seawater density does not change. Five nonzero frequency
modes (two acoustic modes, two inertia–gravity or Poincar´e modes, and one planetary or Rossby
mode) are also sustained by the linearized dynamics, which satisfy an asymptotic general dispersion
relation. The most usual approximations made in physical oceanography (namely incompressibility,
Boussinesq, hydrostatic, and quasigeostrophic) are also consider, and their implications in the
reduction of degrees of freedom (number of independent dynamical ﬁelds or prognostic equations)
of, and compatible waves with, the linearized governing equations are particularly discussed and
emphasized.

INTRODUCTION

II. GENERAL EQUATIONS OF MOTION

The goal of this educational work is to show how the
various types of linear waves in the ocean (acoustic,
inertia–gravity or Poincar´e, and planetary or Rossby
waves) can be obtained from a general dispersion relation
in an approximate (asymptotic) sense. Knowledge of the
theory of partial diﬀerential equations, and basic classical
and ﬂuid mechanics are only needed for the reader to
understand the material presented here, which could be
taught as a special topic in a course of ﬂuid mechanics
for physicists.

The exposition starts by presenting the general
equations of motion for ocean dynamics in Sec. II. This
presentation is not intended to be rigorous, but rather
conceptual. Accordingly, the equations of motion are
simpliﬁed as much as possible for didactic purposes. The
general dispersion relation for the waves supported by
the (inviscid, unforced) linearized dynamics with respect
to a quiescent state is then derived in Sec. III. This is
done by performing a separation of variables between the
vertical direction, on one side, and the horizontal position

and time, on the other side. Sec.
implications of the most common approximations made
in oceanography (namely incompressibility, Boussinesq,
hydrostatic, and quasigeostrophic) in the reduction of
degrees of freedom (number of independent dynamical
ﬁelds or prognostic equations) of, and compatible waves
with, the linearized governing equations. Particular
emphasis is made on this important issue, which is
vaguely covered in standard textbooks (e.g. Refs. 2,3,5).
Some problems have been interspersed within the text to
help the reader to assimilate the material presented. The
solutions to some of these problems are outlined in App.

Let x := (x, y) be the horizontal position,
i.e.
tangential to the Earth’s surface, with x and y its
eastward and northward components, respectively; let z
be the upward coordinate; and let t be time. Unless
otherwise stated all variables are functions of (x,z, t) in
this paper.

The thermodynamic state of the ocean is determined by
three variables, typically S (salinity), T (temperature),
and p (pressure, referred to one atmosphere). Seawater
density, ρ, is a function of these three variables, i.e. ρ =
ρ(S, T, p), known as the state equation of seawater. In
particular,

Here, D := ∂t + u
∇ + w∂z is the substantial or
material derivative, where u and w are the horizontal and
vertical components of the velocity ﬁeld, respectively, and
∇ denotes the horizontal gradient; αS := ρ−1 (∂Sρ)T,p
and αT := ρ−1 (∂T ρ)S,p are the haline contraction and
thermal expansion coeﬃcients, respectively; and αp :=
ρ−1 (∂pρ)T,S = αT Γ + ρ−1c−2
, where Γ is the adiabatic
s
gradient and cs is the speed of sound, which characterize
the compressibility of seawater.

The physical state of the ocean is determined at every
instant by the above three variables (S, T, p) and the
three components of the velocity ﬁeld (u, w), i.e.
six
independent scalar variables. The evolution of these
variables are controlled by

In
Newton’s vertical equation (2d), the term Fw represents
the acceleration due to the vertical component of the
Coriolis and frictional forces, and g is the (constant)
acceleration due to gravity. The term FS in the salinity
equation (2a) represents diﬀusive processes. The term
FT in the thermal energy equation (2b), which follows
from the ﬁrst principle of thermodynamics, represents
the exchange of heat by conduction and radiation, as
well as heating by change of phase, chemical reactions or
viscous dissipation. The pressure or continuity equation
(2c) follows from (1).

We will also neglect frictional eﬀects, so that equations
(2d,e) are seen to be nothing but Euler equations of
(ideal) ﬂuid mechanics with the addition of the Coriolis
force. The latter will be further considered as due solely
to the vertical component of the Earth rotation. Thus,
the following simpliﬁed form of equations (2d,e) will be

Here, ˆz is the upward unit vector and f := 2Ω sin ϑ,
where Ω is the (assumed constant) spinning rate of the
Earth around its axis and ϑ is the geographical latitude,
is the Coriolis parameter. For simplicity, we will avoid
working in full spherical geometry.
Instead, we will
consider f = f0 + βy, where f0 := 2Ω sin ϑ0 and β :=
2ΩR−1 cos ϑ0 with ϑ0 a ﬁxed latitude and R the mean
radius of the planet, and ∇ = (∂x, ∂y), which is known
as the β-plane approximation.
It should remain clear,
however, that a consistent β-plane approximation must
include some geometric (non-Cartesian) terms.7 Neither
these terms nor those of the Coriolis force due to the
horizontal component of the Earth’s rotation contribute
to add waves to the linearized equations of motion. Their
neglection is thus well justiﬁed for the purposes of this
paper.

III. WAVES OF THE LINEARIZED DYNAMICS

Consider a state of rest (u = 0, w = 0) characterized
by dpr/dz =
ρrg, where pr(z) and ρr(z) are reference
proﬁles of pressure and density, respectively. Equations

surface is isopycnic (i.e.
the density does not change

Sturm–Liouville problem. Making the incompressibility

general dispersion relation (37) in an asymptotic WKB

In proper limits, two acoustic waves (AW),
two Poincar´e waves (PW), and one Rossby wave (RW)
can be identiﬁed. The fact that the number of waves
supported by the linearized dynamics equals the number
of independent dynamical ﬁelds or prognostic equations,
i.e. the degrees of freedom of (7), means that the waves
constitute a complete set of solutions of the linearized
dynamics (cf. Table I).

The number of possible eigensolutions can be reduced
is approximations that eliminate some of the prognostic
equations, or independent dynamical ﬁelds, of the system
are performed. The Boussinesq approximation, which
is very appropriate for the ocean, does not eliminate
prognostic equations and has the virtue of reducing
the mathematical complexity of the governing equations
considerably. The incompressibility approximation, in
turn, removes two degrees of

reduces to the so called Euler-Boussinesq equations.
Performing in addition the hydrostatic approximation,
which corresponds to neglecting ∂tw′ in Newton’s vertical
equation, does not amount to a reduction of degrees of
freedom because the vertical velocity is already diagnosed
by the horizontal velocity. In this case, the density ﬁeld
diagnoses the pressure ﬁeld through

∂zp′ =

N 2ζ

.

With this approximation (which implies that of incom-
pressibility) and the Boussinesq approximation, system
(7) reduces to what is known in geophysical ﬂuid
dynamics as the primitive equations.
Finally, one
approximation that eliminates independent ﬁelds is the
quasigeostrophic approximation, which is often used to
study low frequency motions in the ocean, and the Earth
and planetary atmospheres. In this approximation the
density diagnoses the horizontal velocity through the
“thermal wind balance,”

APPENDIX A: SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE
PROBLEMS

Problem 1 To describe the dynamics in a noninertial
reference frame such as one tied to the rotating Earth,
two forces must be included: the Coriolis and centrifugal
forces. However, Laplace1 showed that if the upward
coordinate z is chosen not to lie in the direction of the
gravitational attraction, but rather to be slightly tilted
toward the nearest pole, the centrifugal and gravitational
forces can be made to balance one another in a horizontal
plane (cf. also Ref. 8). With this choice the Coriolis force
is the only one needed to describe the dynamics. Notice
that the absence of the centrifugal force in a system ﬁxed
to the Earth is what actually makes rotation eﬀects real:
they cannot be removed by a change of coordinates.

Under this conditions, ω2 = f 2 + k2N 2/m2 = f 2 + c2k2.
To obtain the dispersion relation for surface gravity

Introduction

A wormhole is a hypothetical tunnel through space. Such a concept has long
been a favorite theme in Star Trek and in science ﬁction. An extensive list of
popular science books[1] are devoted to topics related to wormholes. We might
gauge the popularity of wormholes among students by the recurring references
to them in The Simpsons: in one Halloween special[2], Homer was sucked into
modern-day California while saying “there’s so much I don’t know about astro-
physics, I wish I’d read that book by [Dr. Hawking].” The detailed calculations
about a wormhole are complex and still under debate among physicists, but with
the techniques taught in a standard calculus course[3], a student is capable of
producing the images of wormholes based on sound physical principles. Because
many issues concerning wormholes are not fully resolved yet, this paper is not
meant to be rigorous. We merely attempt to motivate students to apply mathe-
matical skills that they have learned in calculus, and to induce their interest in
non-Euclidean geometry and general relativity through this fascinating subject.

1 Einstein’s Theory of Gravity

Newton’s law of gravity states that the gravitational force between two bodies is
F = GM m/r2, where G is the gravitational constant, m and M are the masses
of the two bodies, and r is the distance between them. Einstein had an entirely
diﬀerent view of gravity. Suppose we were to measure the length of the equator
of the earth very carefully and obtain the circumference C, we would predict
that the radius of the earth is C/2π based on Euclidean geometry. However,
if we indeed dig a hole to the center of the earth and measure the radius, we
would have a value greater (about 1.5 millimeters) than our prediction. If we do
the same for the sun, the discrepancy would be about one-half a kilometer[4].

From this thought experiment, we conclude that the space is curved. There-

fore, the diﬀerential of arc length based on Euclidean geometry,

dσ2 = dx2 + dy2,

(1)

1

is no longer valid. Gauss has developed a generalization of the Cartesian coor-
dinates by drawing a system of arbitrary curves on the surface, designated as
u = 1, u = 2, u = 3, . . ., v = 1, v = 2, v = 3, and so forth (see Figure 1).

u = 1

u = 2

u = 3

v = 3

v = 2

v = 1

Figure 1: Gaussian coordinates.

Using the Gaussian coordinates, the diﬀerential of arc length is

dσ2 = g11 du2 + 2g12 du dv + g22 dv2,

where the coeﬃcients gµν, called metric coeﬃcients, are constants or functions
of u and v. This equation can be construed as a generalized “Pythagorean
theorem.” As an example, with the polar coordinates (r, φ), we have

dσ2 = dr2 + r2dφ2,

where the metric coeﬃcients are grr = 1, gφφ = r2 and grφ = 0 (because the
system is orthogonal). Riemann extended the Gaussian geometry to greater
number of dimensions, and Riemannian geometry later became the mathemat-
ical framework for Einstein’s general relativity. In brief, Einstein conceived of
gravity as a change in the geometry of spacetime due to mass-energy, and his
greatest achievement was to derive a ﬁeld equation which relates the metric
coeﬃcients gµν to mass-energy[5].

2 Schwarzschild Wormhole and Embedding Di-

agram

Shortly after Einstein published his general theory of relativity, Schwarzschild
found a solution[6] for the exterior of a spherically symmetric gravitational
source M .
(A solution to Einstein’s ﬁeld equation can be written as a dif-
ferential of arc length which describes the spacetime warped by gravity.) In the
equatorial plane at a ﬁxed time, the solution is simpliﬁed to

We have adopted a convention in general relativity of measuring mass in units
of length by multiplying the ordinary mass in kilogram by a factor of G/c2,
where G is the gravitational constant and c the speed of light. For example,
the mass of the earth is 0.444 cm, and that of the sun 1.48 km. A reader may
notice the presence of a singularity at r = 2M in equation (4). If we compress
the sun into a sphere of a radius less than 2
1.48 km, we will have a black
hole. The physical signiﬁcance of this singularity is that nothing, not even light,
can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole once it crosses the boundary
r = 2M (the event horizon).

object. The measured radius is l, while the length of equator divided by 2π
gives r.

Equation (4) is a two-dimensional curved surface, and it can be visualized
by means of an embedding diagram[7]. As mentioned earlier, the measured
radius in a curved space is greater than the ratio C/2π (the supposed radius in
a ﬂat space). To visualize this phenomenon, we imagine a ﬁctitious depth z, see
Figure 2, to accommodate the actual radius. We emphasize that this artiﬁcial
z dimension is purely for visual purpose and has nothing to do with real space.
To be more quantitative, the measured distance in a curved space is the inte-
gral
dσ. We want to ﬁnd an embedding formula z, such that the geometry of
a curved two-dimensional space is the same as a ﬂat three-dimensional space. A
ﬂat (Euclidean) three-dimensional space means that the ordinary Pythagorean
theorem is valid, or

dσ2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2.

It is more convenient to rewrite this diﬀerential of arc length using cylindrical
coordinates:

Einstein and Rosen[9] proposed a topology that connects two universes at
r = 2M , and they called such a connection a “bridge.” By joining the positive
and negative solution of z at r = 2M , we have the embedding diagram for the
Einstein-Rosen bridge, as shown in Figure 3. Based of its shape, J. A. Wheeler
coined the term “wormhole” for this type of geometry.

3 Morris-Thorne Wormhole

In 1985, Carl Sagan wrote a novel Contact [10], which was later adopted to a ﬁlm
of the same title released in 1997. Before Sagan published the book, he sought
advice about gravitational physics from a Caltech physicist, Kip Thorne. In the
original manuscript, Sagan had his heroine, Eleanor Arroway (played by Jodie
Foster in the ﬁlm), plunge into a black hole near the earth, travel through the
space, and emerge an hour later near the star Vega, 26 light-years away. Thorne
pointed out a well-established result that it is impossible to travel through the
Schwarzschild wormhole because its throat pinches oﬀ too quickly[11]; in other
words, Figure 3 exists only for a brief moment which is too short to allow
communicating with or traveling to the other part of the universe.

Sagan’s request, however, piqued Thorne’s curiosity about wormholes. Thorne

devised a wormhole solution[12], which is simpliﬁed in the equatorial plane at a
ﬁxed time as

dσ2 =

1

1
0/r2 dr2 + r2dφ2,
b2

(8)

−
where b0 is the radius of the throat.

It is easy to write a mathematical solution for a geometry that we desire,
but Einstein’s ﬁeld equation relates geometry to mass-energy. If we attempt

4

to construct a wormhole which has a geometry as equation (8) and remains
open and stable so that it allows two-way travel, we will need negative-energy
material, called exotic matter by Thorne (and incorporated into Sagan’s novel).
There is a debate about the possibility of such exotic matter, but it is certain
that the energy required is far beyond the producing capacity of a present
and foreseeable future civilization. The hope of space travel in short term is
impractical at least, if not entirely impossible.

Nevertheless, we employ the same procedure as the preceding section to
derive the embedding formula to visualize this geometry. From equations (8)
and (5), we solve for dz:

4 Summary

The images that appear in science literature depicting how a massive body warps
space are based on the concept of embedding a curved two-dimensional surface
in a three-dimensional ﬂat (Euclidean) space. Quantitatively, the Schwarzschild
wormhole can be visualized as a paraboloid of revolution

Gravitational Waves: An Introduction

Indrajit Chakrabarty∗†

Abstract

In this article, I present an elementary introduction to the theory
of gravitational waves. This article is meant for students who have
had an exposure to general relativity, but, results from general rela-
tivity used in the main discussion has been derived and discussed in
the appendices. The weak gravitational ﬁeld approximation is ﬁrst
considered and the linearized Einstein’s equations are obtained. We
discuss the plane wave solutions to these equations and consider the
transverse-traceless (TT) gauge. We then discuss the motion of test
particles in the presence of a gravitational wave and their polarization.
The method of Green’s functions is applied to obtain the solutions to
the linearized ﬁeld equations in presence of a nonrelativistic, isolated
source.

Introduction

In the past few years, research on the detection of gravitational waves has
assumed new directions. Eﬀorts are now underway to detect gravitational
radiation from astrophysical sources, thereby enabling researchers to pos-
sess an additional tool to study the universe (See [6] for a recent review).
According to Newton’s theory of gravitation, the binary period of two point
masses (e.g., two stars) moving in a bound orbit is strictly a constant quan-
tity. However, Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicts that two stars
revolving around each other in a bound orbit suﬀer accelerations, and, as a
result, gravitational radiation is generated. Gravitational waves carry away
energy and momentum at the expense of the orbital decay of two stars,
thereby causing the stars to gradually spiral towards each other and giving
rise to shorter and shorter periods. This anticipated decrease of the orbital
period of a binary pulsar was ﬁrst observed in PSR 1913+16 by Taylor and
Weisberg ([4]). The observation supported the idea of gravitational radia-
tion ﬁrst propounded in 1916 by Einstein in the Proceedings of the Royal
Prussian Academy of Knowledge. Einstein showed that the ﬁrst order con-
tributon to the gravitational radiation must be quadrupolar in a particular
coordinate system. Two years later, he extended his theory to all coordinate
systems.

The weak nature of gravitational radiation makes it very diﬃcult to
design a sensitive detector. Filtering out the noisy background to isolate
the useful signal requires great technical expertise. itself a ﬁeld of research.
Various gravitational wave detectors are fully/partially operational and we
expect a certain result to appear from the observations in the near future.
This article gives an elementary introduction to the theory of gravita-
tional waves. Important topics in general relativity including a brief intro-
duction to tensors and a derivation of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations are discussed
in the appendices. We ﬁrst discuss the weak gravitational ﬁeld approxima-
tion and obtain the linearized Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. We then discuss
the plane wave solutions to these equations in vacuum and the restriction on
them due to the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge. The motion of particles in
the presence of gravitational waves and their polarization is then discussed
in brief. We conclude by applying the method of Green’s functions to show
that gravitational radiation from matter at large distances is predominantly
quadrupolar in nature.

2 The weak gravitational ﬁeld approximation

Einstein’s theory of general relativity leads to Newtonian gravity in the limit
when the gravitational ﬁeld is weak & static and the particles in the gravita-
tional ﬁeld move slowly. We now consider a less restrictive situation where
the gravitational ﬁeld is weak but not static, and there are no restrictions
on the motion of particles in the gravitational ﬁeld. In the absence of grav-
ity, space-time is ﬂat and is characterised by the Minkowski metric, ηµν . A
weak gravitational ﬁeld can be considered as a small ’perturbation’ on the
ﬂat Minkowski metric[3],

gµν = ηµν + hµν ,

hµν | ≪
|

1

Such coordinate systems are often called Lorentz coordinate systems. Indices
of any tensor can be raised or lowered using ηµν or ηµν respectively as
the corrections would be of higher order in the perturbation, hµν . We can
therefore write,

Under a background Lorentz transformation ([3]), the perturbation trans-
forms as a second-rank tensor:

gµν = ηµν

hµν

−

hαβ = Λ µ

α Λ ν

β hµν

The equations obeyed by the perturbation, hµν , are obtained by writing the
Einstein’s equations to ﬁrst order. To the ﬁrst order, the aﬃne connection
(See App. A) is,

µν =

ηλρ[∂µhρν + ∂νhµρ −

Therefore, the Riemann curvature tensor reduces to

We can’t expect the ﬁeld equations (9) to have unique solutions as any solu-
tion to these equations will not remain invariant under a ’gauge’ transforma-
tion. As a result, equations (9) will have inﬁnitely many solutions. In other
words, the decomposition (1) of gµν in the weak gravitational ﬁeld approx-
imation does not completely specify the coordinate system in space-time.
When we have a system that is invariant under a gauge transformation, we
ﬁx the gauge and work in a selected coordinate system. One such coordinate
system is the harmonic coordinate system ([5]). The gauge condition is

In the weak ﬁeld limit, this condition reduces to

µν = 0

3 Plane-wave solutions and the transverse-traceless

(TT) gauge

From the ﬁeld equations in the weak-ﬁeld limit, eqns.(15), we obtain the
linearised ﬁeld equations in vacuum,

The vacuum equations for ¯hµν are similar to the wave equations in electro-
magnetism. These equations admit the plane-wave solutions,

2¯hµν = 0

¯hµν = Aµν exp(ιkαxα)

where, Aµν is a constant, symmetric, rank-2 tensor and kα is a constant
four-vector known as the wave vector. Plugging in the solution (17) into the
equation (16), we obtain the condition

This implies that equation (17) gives a solution to the wave equation (16)
if kα is null; that is, tangent to the world line of a photon. This shows
that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. The time-like
component of the wave vector is often referred to as the frequency of the
(ω, k). Since kα is null,
wave. The four-vector, kµ is usually written as kµ ≡
it means that,

This is often referred to as the dispersion relation for the gravitational wave.
We can specify the plane wave with a number of independent parameters;
10 from the coeﬃcients, Aµν and three from the null vector, kµ. Using the
harmonic gauge condition (14), we obtain,

This imposes a restriction on Aαβ : it is orthogonal (transverse) to kα. The
number of independent components of Aµν is thus reduced to six. We have
to impose a gauge condition too as any coordinate transformation of the
form

Let us choose a solution

that this remaining freedom allows us to convert from the old constants,

where, U β is some ﬁxed four-velocity, that is, any constant time-like unit
vector we wish to choose. The equations (20), (25) and (26) together are
called the transverse traceless (TT) gauge conditions ([3]). Thus, we have
used up all the available gauge freedom and the remaining components of
Aµν must be physically important. The trace condition (25) implies that

¯hT T
αβ = hT T
αβ

Let us now consider a background Lorentz transformation in which the
vector U α is the time basis vector U α = δα
0. Then eqn.(26) implies that
Aµ0 = 0 for all µ. Let us orient the coordinate axes so that the wave
is travelling along the z-direction, kµ
(ω, 0, 0, ω). Then with eqn.(26),
eqn.(20) implies that Aαz = 0 for all α. Thus, AT T

4 Polarization of gravitational waves

In this section, we consider the eﬀect of gravitational waves on free particles.
Consider some particles described by a single velocity ﬁeld, U α and a sepa-
ration vector, ζ α. Then, the separation vector obeys the geodesic equation
(See App. A)

where, U ν = dxν /dτ is the four-velocity of the two particles. We consider the
lowest-order (ﬂat-space) components of U ν only since any corrections to U ν
that depend on hµν will give rise to terms second order in the perturbation in
the above equation. Therefore, U ν = (1, 0, 0, 0) and initially ζ ν = (0, ǫ, 0, 0).
Then to ﬁrst order in hµν , eqn. (29) reduces to

We can now use these equations to describe the polarization of a gravita-
tional wave. Let us consider a ring of particles initially at rest as in Fig.

1(a). Suppose a wave with hT T
xy = 0 hits them. The particles
respond to the wave as shown in Fig. 1(b). First the particles along the
x-direction come towards each other and then move away from each other
as hT T
xx reverses sign. This is often called + polarization. If the wave had

45o to each other unlike in electromagnetic waves were the two states of
polarization.

5 Generation of gravitational waves

In section III, we obtained the plane wave solutions to the linearized Ein-
stein’s equations in vacuum, eqns.(16). To obtain the solution of the lin-
earised equations (15), we will use the Green’s function method. The Green’s
yµ), of the D’Alembertian operator 2, is the solution of
function, G(xµ
the wave equation in the presence of a delta function source:

−

2 G(xµ

yµ) = δ(4)(xµ

yν)

where δ(4) is the four-dimensional Dirac delta function. The general solution
to the linearized Einstein’s equations (15) can be written using the Green’s
function as

The solutions to the eqn.(34) are called advanced or retarded according as
they represent waves travelling backward or forward in time, respectively.
We are interested in the retarded Green’s function as it represents the net
eﬀect of signals from the past of the point under consideration. It is given

the disturbance in the gravitational ﬁeld at (t, x) is a sum of the inﬂuences
from the energy and momentum sources at the point (tR, y) on the past
light cone.

Using the expression (37), we now consider the gravitational radiation
emitted by an isolated far away source consisting of very slowly moving
particles (the spatial extent of the source is negligible compared to the dis-
tance between the source and the observer). The Fourier transform of the
perturbation ¯hµν is

is the retarded time. In the expression (54), we see
that the gravitational wave produced by an isolated, monochromatic and
non-relativistic source is therefore proportional to the second derivative of
the quadrupole moment of the energy density at the point where the past
light cone of the observer intersects the cone. The quadrupolar nature of
the wave shows itself by the production of shear in the particle distribution,
and there is zero average translational motion. The leading contribution to
electromagnetic radiation comes from the changing dipole moment of the
charge density. This remarkable diﬀerence in the nature of gravitational
and electromagnetic radiation arises from the fact that the centre of mass
of an isolated system can’t oscillate freely but the centre of charge of a
charge distribution can. The quadrupole momnet of a system is generally
smaller than the dipole moment and hence gravitational waves are weaker
than electromagnetic waves.

6 Epilogue

This lecture note on gravitational waves leaves several topics untouched.
There are a number of good references on gravitation where the inquisitive
reader can ﬁnd more about gravitational waves and their detection. I have

11

freely drawn from various sources and I don’t claim any originality in this
work. I hope I have been able to incite some interest in the reader about a
topic on which there is a dearth of literature.

Appendix A: Some topics in general theory of relativity

An event in relativity is characterised by a set of coordinates (t, x, y, z)
in a deﬁnite coordinate system. Transformations between the coordinates
of an event observed in two diﬀerent reference frames are called Lorentz
transformations. These transformations mix up space and time and hence
the coordinates are redeﬁned so that all of them have dimensions of length.
We write x0
z and a general component of a four
≡
vector (x0, x1, x2, x3) as xµ. A Lorentz transformation is then written as

At this point, it is useful to note the Einstein summation convention: when-
ever an index appears as a subscript and as a superscript in an expression,
we sum over all values taken by the index. Under a Lorentz transformation,
(ct)2 + x2 + y2 + z2 remains invariant. The length

We never extract a square root of the expression (59) since
can be nega-
tive. Four-vectors that have negative length are called time-like, while those
with positive lengths are called space-like. Four-vectors with zero length are
called null. The notion of “norm” of a four-vector is introduced with the
help of the Minkowski metric:

gκλ is called the metric tensor; it is a symmetric, second-rank tensor.

To follow the motion of a freely falling particle, an inertial coordinate
system is suﬃcient.
In an inertial frame, a particle at rest will remain
so if no forces act on it. There is a frame where particles move with a
uniform velocity. This is the frame which falls freely in a gravitational ﬁeld.
Since this frame accelerates at the same rate as the free particles do, it
follows that all such particles will maintain a uniform velocity relative to this
frame. Uniform gravitational ﬁelds are equivalent to frames that accelerate
uniformly relative to inertial frames. This is the Principle of Equivalence
between gravity and acceleration. The principle just stated is known as the
Weak Equivalence Principle because it only refers to gravity.

In treating the motion of a particle in the presence of gravity, we deﬁne

the Christoﬀel symbol or the aﬃne connection as

Γ plays the same role for the gravitational ﬁeld as the ﬁeld strength tensor
does for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Using the deﬁnition of aﬃne connection,
we can obtain the expression for the covariant derivative of a tensor:

≡

κνAα

DκAν

∂Aν
∂xκ + Γν
It is straightforward to conclude that the covariant derivative of the metric
tensor vanishes. The concept of “parallel transport” of a vector has im-
portant implications. We can’t deﬁne globally parallel vector ﬁelds. We
can deﬁne local parallelism. In the Euclidean space, a straight line is the
only curve that parallel transports its own tangent vector. In curved space,
we can draw “nearly” straight lines by demanding parallel transport of the
tangent vector. These “lines” are called geodesics. A geodesic is a curve of
extremal length between any two points. The equation of a geodesic is

The parameter λ is called an aﬃne parameter. A curve having the same path
as a geodesic but parametrised by a non-aﬃne parameter is not a geodesic
curve. The Riemannian curvature tensor is deﬁned as

In a “ﬂat” space,

Geodesics in a ﬂat space maintain their separation; those in curved spaces
don’t. The equation obeyed by the separation vector ζ α in a vector ﬁeld V
is

DV DV ζ α = Rµ

If we diﬀerentiate the Riemannian curvature tensor and permute the indices,
we obtain the Bianchi identity:

∂λRαβµν + ∂ν Rαβλµ + ∂µRαβνλ = 0

Since in an inertial coordinate system the aﬃne connection vanishes, the
equation above is equivalent to one with partials replaced by covariant
derivatives. The Ricci tensor is deﬁned as

Rαβ ≡

Rµ

αµβ = Rβα

It is a symmetric second rank tensor. The Ricci scalar (also known as scalar
curvature) is obtained by a further contraction,

The stress-energy tensor (also called energy-momentum tensor) is deﬁned as
the ﬂux of the α-momentum across a surface of constant xβ. In component
form, we have:

1. T 00 = Energy density = ρ

2. T 0i = Energy ﬂux (Energy may be transmitted by heat cinduction)

3. T i0 = Momentum density (Even if the particles don’t carry momen-
tum, if heat is being conducted, then the energy will carry momentum)

4. T ij = Momentum ﬂux (Also called stress)

Appendix B: The Einstein ﬁeld equation

The curvature of space-time is necessary and suﬃcient to describe grav-
ity. The latter can be shown by considering the Newtonian limit of the
geodesic equation. We require that

the particles are moving slowly with respect to the speed of light,

the gravitational ﬁeld is weak so that it may be considered as a per-
turbation of ﬂat space, and,

the gravitational ﬁeld is static.

In this limit, the geodesic equation changes to,

d2xµ
dτ 2 + Γµ
00(
The aﬃne connection also simpliﬁes to

dt
dτ

)2 = 0

In the weak gravitational ﬁeld limit, we can lower or raise the indices of a
tensor using the Minkowskian ﬂat metric, e.g.,

Then, the aﬃne connection is written as

The geodesic equation then reduces to

The concept of an inertial mass arises from Newton’s second law:

f = mia

According to the the law of gravitation, the gravitational force exerted on an
abject is proportional to the gradient of a scalar ﬁeld Φ, known as the scalar
gravitational potential. The constant of proportionality is the gravitational
mass, mg:

−
According to the Weak Equivalence Principle, the inertial and gravitational
masses are the same,

fg =

Comparing equations (86) and (91), we ﬁnd that they are the same if we
identify,

Thus,

The curvature of space-time is suﬃcient to describe gravity in the Newto-
nian limit as along as the metric takes the form (93). All the basic laws of
Physics, beyond those governing freely-falling particles adapt to the curva-
ture of space-time (that is, to the presence of gravity) when we are work-
ing in Riemannian normal coordinates. The tensorial form of any law is
coordinate-independent and hence, translating a law into the language of
tensors (that is, to replace the partial derivatives by the covariant deriva-
tives), we will have an universal law which holds in all coordinate systems.
This procedure is sometimes called the Principle of Equivalence. For exam-
ple, the conservation equation for the energy-momentum tensor T µν in ﬂat
space-time, viz.,

is immediately adapted to the curved space-time as,

This equation expresses the conservation of energy in the presence of a
gravitational ﬁeld. We can now introduce Einstein’s ﬁeld equations which

∂µT µν = 0

DµT µν = 0

governs how the metric responds to energy and momentum. We would like
to derive an equation which will supercede the Poisson equation for the
Newtonian potential:

2Φ =

4πGρ

∇

−

(96)

∇

2 = δij∂i∂j is the Laplacian in space and ρ is the mass density.
where,
A relativistic generalisation of this equation must have a tensorial form so
that the law is valid in all coordinate systems. The tensorial counterpart of
the mass density is the energy-momentum tensor, T µν . The gravitational
potential should get replaced by the metric. Thus, we guess that our new
equation will have T µν set proportional to some tensor which is second-order
in the derivatives of the metric,

T µν = κAµν

(97)

where, Aµν is the tensor to be found. The requirements on the equation
above are:-

By deﬁnition, the R.H.S must be a second-rank tensor.

It must contain terms linear in the second derivatives or quadratic in
the ﬁrst derivative of the metric.

The R.H.S must be symmetric in µ and ν as T µν is symmetric.

Since T µν is conserved, the R.H.S must also be conserved.

The ﬁrst two conditions require the right hand side to be of the form

αRµν + βRgµν = Tµν

where Rµν is the Ricci tensor, R is the scalar curvature and α & β are
constants. This choice is symmetric in µ and ν and hence satisﬁes the third
condition. From the last condition, we obtain

gνσDσ(αRµν + βRgµν ) = 0

This equation can’t be satisﬁed for arbitrary values of α and β. This equa-
tion holds only if α/β is ﬁxed. As a consequence of the Bianchi identity,
viz.,

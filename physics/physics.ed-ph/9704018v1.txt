When considering motion on a map of landmarks ﬁxed
with respect to an inertial reference frame, the map-frame
choice deﬁnes both distances and simultaneity. The metric
equation then connects a traveler-time with a map-time. In
ﬂat space-time, these yield two inter-convertable velocities, an
invariant acceleration, and one space plus three time-integrals
of constant acceleration (the two most useful at high speeds
being an impulse equation for force “felt” by the traveler,
and a momentum equation associated with action-reaction).
Some practical laws, like Newton’s based on kinematical and
dynamical assumptions, then follow for describing invariances
and solving acceleration problems using only one, not multi-
ple, inertial frames. Similar application in non-ﬂat metrics
may follow as well. From UMStL-CME-97a14pf.

I. INTRODUCTION

Motion at any speed can be studied without a need for
transforming between objects in relative motion, using
information from the space-time metric equation itself
concerning the rate at which moving clocks slow with re-
spect to ﬁxed clocks, if simultaneity and distances are
considered only with respect to a single inertial reference
(or “map”) frame. This works without the need for trans-
forming, since choosing a map-frame unambiguously de-
ﬁnes both distances between objects, and simultaneity
between events: two things which relativity has shown
to be frame-dependent.

This approach was not used in early papers [1], per-
haps because an early inspiration for the ideas was the
postulate that for light there is no physically-special ref-
erence frame. However, when the focus turns to solving
problems, it is quite natural to select a convenient, if
otherwise arbitrary, frame of reference for drawing maps
and describing motion. For example, when mapping the
solar system we might choose a map-frame at rest with
respect to the sun, or the solar system’s center of mass.
Likewise, when drawing even the simplest general rela-
tivistic “embedding diagrams” of space-time curvature,
we must select a frame of motion as well [2].

Once this choice is made, we get from the metric equa-
tion any equations for accelerated motion that we wish,
and are able to express them concretely in terms solely
of position in our reference frame, and time-elapsed on
the traveler as well as map clocks. Moreover, by choos-

1

ing the acceleration of interest to be that “felt” by the
traveling object of interest, we ﬁnd that Newton’s second
law at high speed breaks into two integrals, one for time-
elapsed on traveler clocks, and a second one (related to
momentum conservation) for time-elapsed on the map. A
work-energy relation very similar to the classical one also
emerges, as does a way to put Galileo’s geometrically-
derived equations for constant acceleration to use at high
as well as low speed.

II. THE BASICS

First, a word about notation. Many of the relation-
ships we discuss here are easy to see in 4-vector form. In
fact, a set of 4-vector equations for motion under con-
stant proper acceleration has been consulted often in the
writing of this paper. However the objective is to make
calculations involving motion at any speed as concrete
as possible. Although the strategy is based deeply in
the metric, it is by no means coordinate-free. On the
contrary, one might think of the strategy used here as
map-based, or even frame-dependent! Since in reality we
experience time very diﬀerently than we do space, the
equations likely to be used by engineers who solve rel-
ativistic problems will have diﬀerent units for distance
and for time, and where possible will be expressed in the
context of a single inertial reference frame. Hence the
spirit of what follows.

A. The kinematical and dynamical postulates

Because the focus is on motion at any speed, but not
speciﬁcally on relative motion, we begin with the metric
equation rather than with either Lorentz transforms, or
a postulate about the relative speed of light. One might,
for example, say: “In order to understand how mag-
netism results from electric currents in neutral wires, and
how lightspeed is independent of the earth’s direction of
travel, Einstein (in terms introduced later by Minkowski)
postulated [1] that the time dτ elapsed on the clocks of
a traveler is related to the time and position changes
(dt, dx) seen by a stationary observer, via the almost
Pythagoras-like metric equation:

(cdτ )2 = (cdt)2

(dx)2

(dy)2

(dz)2,

(1)

−

−

−

where c is the speed of light.” We say that this equation
constitutes the “kinematical assumption” in ﬂat space-
time.

For each of the two times in this equation, we deﬁne
two velocities or time-derivatives of position on the map.
The derivative with respect to map-time is the usual
dx
coordinate-velocity v
dt , while the derivative with re-
dx
spect to traveler-time is called proper-velocity w
dτ
[3,4]. It is easy from the metric equation to show that the
rate at which map-time changes per unit traveler-time,
or in other words the “speed-of-map-time” γ if we deﬁne
simultaneity from the perspective of the map-frame, is
simply:

The above variable deﬁnitions take steps toward making
application of the integrals of accelerated motion, to be
discussed in the next section, as simple and concrete as
possible.

Also relevant to our choice of variables is the “dynami-
cal assumption”. One might describe this simply by say-
ing: “Einstein further noted that an object of mass m
mc2, related to to-
may then have a rest-energy Eo ≡
tal energy E (kinetic plus rest) and momentum p by the
relation

E2 = E2

o + (pc)2 .”

(3)

This relation follows by multiplying the metric equation
above by (mc)2 and dividing by dτ twice, provided one
assumes that the quantities conserved (in all isolated in-
teractions) are momenutm p
mw and total energy
≡
γmc2. This dynamical assumption has of course
E
been shown to work very well in practice.

B. Variables to monitor changes in velocity

sinh−1[ wk

For describing motion at any speed, we introduce three
other classes of variables: a pair of velocity functions, a
pair of accelerations, and the “Galilean-kinematic” ve-
locity/time pair. The ﬁrst velocity function, which oper-
ates on that component of the proper-velocity in the di-
rection of coordinate-acceleration, is the parallel rapidity
(or hyperbolic velocity-angle) ηk ≡
c ]. The sec-
ond velocity-component function, which operates on that
component of the coordinate-velocity which is orthogo-
nal to the direction of coordinate-acceleration, is the so-
called “transverse time-speed”, or γ⊥ ≡
√1−(v⊥/c)2 . This
dt
quantity is that part of the “speed-of-map-time” γ
dτ
that would result from only the component of coordinate-
velocity perpendicular to the direction of velocity change.
Because γ⊥ depends entirely on the velocity-component
perpendicular to the direction of velocity-change, it will
be constant iﬀ the direction of acceleration is constant.

Also note that when the motion is uni-directional (e.g.
in 1+1D special relativity), v⊥ = 0, γ⊥ = 1, and we can
deﬁne rapidity η
c ].
Concerning accelerations, coordinate-acceleration a

≡
dv
dt = d
is the only acceleration discussed in classi-
cal descriptions of motion [5,6]. Given two times to keep
track of, one might also consider proper, and mixed, time
derivatives of coordinate position. As we show later, how-
ever, of most use is the frame-invariant acceleration “felt”
by the traveler, i.e. the proper-acceleration [7]. This ac-
celeration is not the second time-derivative of position
with respect to either map or traveler time! Rather, it’s
magnitude is the rate at which parallel rapidity changes
dηk
per unit traveler-time (α
dτ ), while its vector relation
to coordinate-acceleration is: α = γ
a [8]. This accelera-
γ⊥
tion enters directly into integrals of the motion involving
the conserved quantities energy and momentum, as we
will see, and hence is the acceleration most deeply con-
nected to the dynamics of motion.

C. Galileo’s “chase-plane”

≡

The last set of variables are the “Galilean-kinematic”
time-velocity pair. These are based on the behavior of
physical clocks in a chase-plane, whose velocity is linked
to that of our traveler so that proper-acceleration is the
second derivative of traveler-position on the map, with
respect to chase-plane time. If we use T to denote time
dx
on the clocks of such a chase plane, and V
dT to
denote the rate of change of map-position for our traveler
per unit time on chase-plane clocks, then we require that
α = dV
dT .

This “Galilean-kinematic” velocity V ,

like proper-
velocity w,
involves the rate of change of a traveler’s
position, with respect to landmarks and meter-sticks at
rest in a map-frame, per unit time on clocks not sta-
tionary in that map frame. These “non-coordinate” ve-
locities are examples of the inﬁnite set of such physical
non-coordinate velocities which may be used to moni-
tor the motion of objects on reference-frame maps. The
requirement above, for proper-acceleration as a second-
derivative of map-position, is met for the clocks in a
dxcp
chase-plane traveling with total velocity v′
dt =
c
2(γ/γ⊥−1) , and transverse component matching

the traveler (i.e. v′
⊥ = v⊥) [9]. Here primed quantities re-
fer to chase-plane motion with respect to the map-frame,
while unprimed quantities refer to traveler motion in the
map-frame, as described above.

≡

One can show that the motion of this chase-plane is
intermediate to that of traveler and map, so that in the
classical limit when diﬀerences in traveler and map time
are negligible, these chase-plane equations provide an ac-
curate and simple approximation: namely the approxi-
mation discovered by Galileo well before Newton’s birth

[10]. Remarkably, they also provide an accurate descrip-
tion of motion at any speed on a reference-frame map,
monitored with clocks in the chase-plane deﬁned here!

interaction, integrals of constant coordinate-acceleration
are of little interest [13].
Integrals of constant frame-
invariant “felt” (i.e. proper) acceleration are, therefore,
the focus here.

D. Inter-velocity conversions

It may be helpful to summarize the foregoing kinematic
relations between parameters related to velocity with a
single string of equalities. If we use γ
mc2 as the
dependent quantity (since it is the one “velocity parame-
ter” which discards sign information), we can add terms
for parallel-rapidity and Galilean-velocity to the equality
string in equation 2:

Except for the above-mentioned information on veloc-
ity sign, these strings contain all of the information on
velocity inter-conversions needed for the solution of con-
stant acceleration problems at any speed. Conversions in
closed form, which preserve the sign-information, follow
directly as well.

III. THE INTEGRALS OF CONSTANT
ACCELERATION.

As H. Minkowski suggests [11], the metric equation
alone is adequate to derive the integrals of motion un-
der constant accelerations of any type, just as integrals
of motion in the classical limit follow from the kinematic
connection between acceleration, velocity, position, and
time there as well [12]. The dynamics, which of course tie
the metric equation into applications, concern not these
integrals themselves, but rather the way that some vari-
ables are conserved when objects interact. For example,
in classical kinematics, the time (or momentum) integral,
namely ∆v = a∆t, and the distance (or work-energy) in-
1
2 v2
= a∆x, both follow from our deﬁ-
tegral, namely ∆
nitions of velocity, acceleration, and the c
metric as-
sociation between time and distance alone. The dynam-
ical usefulness of the equations, however, only becomes
clear when we associate mv and 1
2 mv2 with the conserved
quantities momentum, and energy, respectively.

Similarly, in the case of ﬂat space-time, one can derive
integrals of any type of acceleration using kinematical
assumptions (i.e. the metric equation) alone. Because of

Given the variables introduced above, four simple inte-

cedure which works for integrating other non-coordinate
velocity/time expressions as well [9]. The resulting inte-

ones in the pargraph above, as

Note that both v⊥ and the “transverse time-speed” γ⊥
are constants. Hence proper-velocity and longitudinal
mwk change uniformly with map-time,
momentum pk ≡
parallel rapidity (and impulse delivered from the trav-
eler’s view) change uniformly with traveler-time, energy
γmc2 changes at a uniform rate with increase in
E
map-distance, and Galilean-kinematic velocity changes
uniformly with increase in chase-plane time.

≡

Using these equations, one can solve constant accelera-
tion problems at any speed, and can examine the quanti-
tative behavior of any of the velocities and accelerations,
as well as their relationship to dynamical quantities like
momentum and energy. We draw out some of these re-
lationships in the last section of this paper, where we
attempt a practical summary which at the same time
mirrors underlying relationships.

(7)

This string of equalities, in combination with the ve-
locity inter-conversions in the previous section, provide
equations for solving uni-directional constant accelera-
tion problems at any speed.

3

One might consider 11 variables at the heart of any
uni-directional problem to be the frame-invariant accel-
eration α, the map-distance traveled ∆x, elapsed-times
in context of map, traveler, and/or chase-plane clocks
(∆t, ∆τ , ∆T ), and initial and ﬁnal velocities expressed
inter-changably as coordinate-velocities (vi, vf ), proper-
velocities (wi, wf ), or Galilean-kinematic velocities (Vi,
Vf ). Only three of these variables can be speciﬁed inde-
pendently.

Because of the interchangability of velocity types, this
leaves us with 25 types of independent variable assign-
ments, 3 of which involve no elapsed-times given, 12
of which involve only a single given elapsed-time, 9 of
which involve two given elapsed-times, and the last of
which involves all three elapsed-times as input. Al-
though none of these problems is diﬃcult to solve nu-
merically, we have yet to identify closed-form solutions
to one of the 12 single-time problem types, and 9 of the
10 which involve more than one input time-elapsed (cf.
http://newton.umsl.edu/˜philf/a1dwuzzl.html).

IV. SOME LAWS OF MOTION AT ANY SPEED.

In what follows, we summarize the consequences of
these observations in a form designed to highlight their
physical meaning for motion in ﬂat space-time. The ﬁrst
three items in the resulting list of statements shows sim-
ilarities with Newton’s three laws of motion [5] which
hopefully reﬂect elements of the world that Newton saw
which survive even at high speeds. However, unlike New-
ton’s laws, the items here are not all in the form of pos-
tulates. Rather, the kinematic postulate is introduced
in I (before rates of change of velocity are considered),
and some of its consequences when considering rates of
velocity change are ennumerated in II, and VII. The pos-
tulate of momentum conservation is introduced in III,
with some of its consequences at high speed ennumer-
ated in IV. Lastly, the postulate of energy conservation
(which Maxwell and others said was implicit in Newton’s
laws as well [6]) is introduced explicitly in V, with some
consequences drawn out in VI.

the “speed-of-map-time” γ

one place below, perhaps because it is useful in so many
places, is the “transverse time-speed” γ⊥ ≡

red)

with choice of map frame, can be an enlightening ex-
ercise. A version of this paper, so-colored to highlight
frame invariances and the lack thereof in diﬀerence op-
erators as well as variables, will be made available at

I. Motion without forces: In the absence of exter-
nal forces, objects follow geodesics in space-time. For the
special case of the ﬂat metric, this means that an object
at rest continues at rest, and an object in motion contin-
ues in motion. When one deﬁnes simultaneity, as well as
all distances used, from the perspective of a single inertial
reference or “map” frame, this means that such objects

Aside: At rest on the earth, we “feel” ourselves accel-
erated against the gravitational curvature of space-time
by a chain of interactions with matter, beginning at the
very center of our planet. However, there is no conserva-
tion law associated with this feeling, except perhaps the
propensity of an object to follow a geodesic in space-time.
After all, a “felt” force need do no work, and it seems to
follow from kinematic considerations alone. The connec-
tion of this law to dynamics, present in Newton’s classical
2nd law [5], has moved to IV below, following the sepa-
ration of map-time from traveler-time at high speed.

III. Action-reaction: The vector momentum p of

object to another, there is an equal and opposite transfer
of momentum from the other back to the ﬁrst.

rate of momentum transfer from object i per unit change

ject i, on our moving object. The sum of frame-variant
forces on our object then equals the change in proper-
velocity w per unit map-time t, times rest-mass m, or

V. The total energy, and dispersion, relations:
For every transfer of energy from one object to another,
there is a loss of energy from the ﬁrst. According to
Chandrasekhar [6], this may have been implicit in New-
ton’s action-reaction law. Total energy and momen-

VI. The work or displacement/energy integral:
The rate at which an object’s energy changes, per unit

considers time T on the clocks of a chase-plane following
our object with the same transverse velocity (i.e. v′

2(γ/γ⊥−1) , then
uniformly accelerated motion at any speed is described by
Galileo’s two simple integrals for motion under constant
acceleration, namely: ∆V = α∆T and ∆
= 2α∆x
[9]. Since chase-plane motion parallel to the acceleration-
direction is intermediate to that of object and map-frame,
at speeds low enough to make elapsed-times for object
and map similar, these equations predict the behavior of
their clocks, and parallel velocity components as well.

Those items in the list above which do not introduce

for uni-directional motion, that we rewrite them here
speciﬁcally for that case:

IIu. The uni-directional proper-time/impulse
relation: The force Fo felt by an accelerated object
may be obtained by multiplying that object’s proper-
acceleration α by its rest-mass m, i.e. Fo = mα. This
proper-acceleration α has a frame-invariant magnitude
equal to lightspeed c times the rate that the rapidity,
or hyperbolic arcsine of the unit-free proper-velocity,
changes per unit time τ on the clocks of the object, i.e.
α = c ∆η
c ] =
cosh−1[γ].

∆τ = γ3a, where η = sinh−1[ w

c ] = tanh−1[ v

IVu. The unidirectional map-time/momentum
relation: The rate of momentum transfer from object
i per unit change in map-time t deﬁnes a frame-variant
force Fi of object i, on our moving object. The sum of
frame-variant forces on our object then equals the change
in proper-velocity w per unit map-time t, times rest-mass
m, or Fnet =
dt . This net frame-variant
force is integrable for constant “felt force” Fo, and simply
equal to ∆p

Fi = m dw

∆t = Fo.

VIu. The unidirectional work-energy relation:
The rate at which an object’s energy changes, per unit

map-distance traveled in the direction of the “felt” force,
equals the magnitude of the “felt” force Fo, i.e. ∆E
∆x = Fo.
If one
VIIu. The uni-directional chase-plane:
considers time T on the clocks of a chase-plane following
(v/c)2
our object with a velocity v′ = c
2(γ−1) , then uni-
formly accelerated motion at any speed is described by
Galileo’s two simple integrals for motion under constant
acceleration, namely: ∆V = α∆T and ∆
= 2α∆x
[9]. Since chase-plane motion is intermediate to that of
accelerated-object and map-frame, at speeds low enough
to make elapsed-times for map and object similar, these
equations predict the behavior of their clocks and veloc-
ities as well.

V. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

We illustrate here a “map-based” approach to describ-
ing motion at any speed, which follows from kinemat-
ical and dynamical postulates tied to the metric equa-
tion alone. By restricting the focus to distances mea-
sured only with respect to a map-frame of choice, issues
of length contraction and frame-dependent simultaneity
do not arise. Nonetheless, matters such as the behav-
ior of clocks and accelerated motion may be addressed
easily, using equations and laws similar to those used for
treating motion classically.

This strategy allows concrete solution of high-speed
problems in ﬂat space-time, by students not yet ready
for Lorentz transforms or the study of multiple inertial
frames. In fact, it suggests the possibility that we might
eventually be able to introduce students to the study of
motion correctly the ﬁrst time, using tools that work at
any speed.

Because the strategy ﬁnds equations of motion from
the metric equation, it may also prove useful in non-ﬂat
space-time applications. For example, if the masses in
motion are suﬃciently small that we can consider metric
coeﬃcients to result only from masses ﬁxed with respect
to the “map-frame”, then at least a subset of the possible
“test-mass” trajectories might yield themselves to closed-
form solution. At the very least, such trajectory solutions
would provide students with a quantitative handle on
experiences associated with curved space-time.

The evolution and revival structure of angular momentum quantum wave packets

In this paper a coherent superposition of angular momentum states created by absorption of
polarized light by molecules is analyzed. Attention is paid to the time evolution of wave packets
representing spatial orientation of internuclear axis of diatomic molecule. Two examples are consid-
ered in detail. Molecules absorbing light in a permanent magnetic ﬁeld experiencing Zeeman eﬀect
and molecules absorbing light in a permanent electric ﬁeld experiencing quadratic Stark eﬀect. In a
magnetic ﬁeld we have a wave packet that evolves in time exactly as classical dipole oscillator in a
permanent magnetic ﬁeld. In the second case we have the wave packet that goes through periodical
changes of a shape of the packet and revivals of initial shape. This is a pure quantum behavior.
Classical motion of angular momentum in an electric ﬁeld in case of quadratic Stark eﬀect is known
to be aperiodic. Obtained solutions for wave packet evolution are brieﬂy compared with Rydberg
state coherent wave packets and harmonic oscillator wave packets.

I. INTRODUCTION

There are some problems that can be found in every classical mechanics text book. For example, rotation of the
planets around the Sun under the action of the gravitation force or the oscillations of the pendulum under the action
of the quasielastic force.

In quantum mechanics there are very similar problems of the same importance. The motion of the electron around
the nucleus under the action of Coulomb force or the vibration of a diatomic molecule along the line connecting both
nuclei. To compare these two sets of problems from which the ﬁrst belongs to the macroscopic world and the other
to the microscopic world one can ask the questions of a type: Is it possible to observe the motion of an electron in
a Kepler orbit around the nucleus in the same way as it is possible to observe the motion of the planet around the
Sun? That is, is it possible to obtain experimentally a Rutherford atom when electron rotates around the nucleus in
a Kepler orbit? Is it possible to observe oscillations of the nuclei in a molecule that are similar to classical oscillations
of point particle bound by a quasielastic force? An aﬃrmative answer to these questions, as is well known, is given
by the correspondence principle of quantum mechanics [1].

The most common way how we can experimentally examine the objects in the micro world is by their interaction with
light. At the same time it is common wisdom, see for example [1], that the methods of ordinary optical spectroscopy
generally involve excitation of individual stationary states of atoms and molecules. Such states describe objects that
are quantum mechanical by nature. For example, even for arbitrarily large quantum numbers a single stationary state
of an electron in a Coulomb ﬁeld does not come close to describing the motion of a localized particle in a Kepler orbit,
just as for any quantum number a stationary wave function of a harmonic oscillator does not describe the harmonic
oscillations of a localized particle. In fact, classical motion is never obtained from excitation of single quantum state.
Recently, with the use of ultrashort optical pulses, it has become possible to create coherent superpositions of many
quantum states to obtain localized wave packets that are particle-like objects that obey quasiclassical laws, see [2,3]
and references cited therein. Usually electrons moving in orbits with large radiuses and oscilations of molecules are
examined in these experiments. The processes with these wave packets usually are very fast – often occurring on a pico-
or even on a femto-second time scale. These types of processes are most often analyzed to examine correspondence
between the classical and quantum description of the objects in the microscopic world.

The interaction of particles with deﬁnite angular momentum with electric and magnetic ﬁelds provides a second,
more accessible, but less exploited, way to examine the correspondence between the quantum and classical nature
of the microscopic world. For example, from the view point of classical physics the angular momentum vector of a
charged particle spinning in a magnetic ﬁeld will precess around the ﬁeld direction with the Larmor frequency [4]

preserving the projection of the angular momentum on the direction of the ﬁeld. Here gJ is a Lande factor, µB is the
Bohr magneton, and B is the magnetic ﬁeld strength. To determine the behavior of a particle – atom or molecule
– in an external magnetic ﬁeld in quantum mechanics one must deal with the particle’s angular momentum states

and corresponding wave functions YJM (θ, ϕ). To obtain classical-like motion of quantum angular momentum in an
external ﬁeld one must analyze superposition of angular momentum states. For diatomic molecules squared modulus
of this superpositional wave packet Ψ (θ, ϕ, t) will show the probability to ﬁnd molecular axis with a certain orientation
2 sin θdθdϕ is a probability to ﬁnd molecular axis in the direction in space characterized

by spherical angles θ and ϕ. For the case of molecules this approach has another advantage. To compare classical and
quantum results usually one wants to examine the behavior of the system as the angular momentum become large.
According to the correspondence principle these states should behave classically. For the case of rotational states of
molecules it is very common and straightforward to create states with large angular momentum quantum numbers,
with J
100 typical [5]. The situation is diﬀerent for the case of atomic Rydberg states. It is not at all easy to create
in a laboratory states with principal quantum number n close to 100 [2].

Partially the problem to obtain coherent superposition of angular momentum states was solved already many
years ago, when quantum beats in an external magnetic ﬁeld were observed experimentally for the ﬁrst time by
Aleksandrov in Russia [6] and by Dodd with coworkers in United Kingdom [7]. They used light pulse to excite
coherently several angular momentum states
= YJM (θ, ϕ) with the same angular momentum quantum number
J, but diﬀerent magnetic quantum numbers M simultaneously and coherently. In an external magnetic ﬁeld these
angular momentum states have diﬀerent energies EM and hence the corresponding wave functions have diﬀerent phase
factors exp[
i(EM /¯h)t]. In an experiment one can observe harmonic time dependencies of polarized ﬂuorescence that
corresponds to the beats between these wave functions with diﬀerent phase factors in the same way as in a signal
processing one can observe beets between two or more harmonic signals with slightly diﬀerent frequencies.

From the practical view point these experiments can be more straightforward than experiments with Rydberg state
atoms or instant excitation of oscillations in molecules. An obvious reason for this is that speed of the processes in
an external ﬁeld usually are slower and in any case it can be controlled by controlling external ﬁeld strength. As a
result, for excitation of the state one can use much longer laser pulses and also observation of the state dynamics can
be performed by much slower experimental devices [5].

In this paper quantum beat experiments will be analyzed by considering the creation and time evolution of angularly
localized wave packets. This unique approach provides an opportunity to examine the correspondence between classical
and quantum–mechanical periodic motion as induced by electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In our knowledge from these
positions these experiments have not been analyzed before.

II. REVIVAL STRUCTURE OF WAVE PACKETS

The time-dependant wave functions for angularly localized angular momentum quantum wave packets formed as a

coherent superposition of angular momentum eigenstates may be written as

where YJM (θ, ϕ) is an ordinary spherical function [8] and the coeﬃcients cM are complex amplitudes.

We would like to examine to what extent and for how long time evolution of this wave packet coincides with the
predictions of classical physics. For example, classically, an angular momentum of a rotating rigid charge distribution
will precess in the magnetic ﬁeld with the Larmor frequency ωL (1.1). If there is a coincidence between the quantum
and classical discription, then the position of the “center of gravity” of a spatially localized wave packet (the average
value of the particle angular coordinates) must precess in space according to the rules of classical mechanics [4]

Here J is a classical angular momentum vector, µ — magnetic dipole moment of particle, B — strength of the external
magnetic ﬁeld.

Because classical particles have a deﬁnite direction of angular momentum, wave packets localized in space usually
have cM well centered around some particular mean quantum number M . For a similar reason wave packets that can
be created from stationary atomic Rydberg state wave functions are centered around some deﬁnite value n of the
principle quantum number n of the atomic state. Rydberg wave packets weighted by coeﬃcients possessing Gaussian
distribution [9] are particularly well investigated:

What we are interested in most, when we think about evolution of wave packets is, what are the laws governing the
long-term postclassical evolution of wave packets beyond the bounds of the dynamics according to the correspondence
principle?

The assumption that the weighting probabilities

2 are strongly centered around a mean value M (or n, v) means
that only those states with energies EM near the value EM enter appreciably into the sum of Eq. (2.1). This permits
an expansion of energy in a Taylor series in M around the centrally excited value M

The ﬁrst time scale Tcl is called the classical period. It is the period after which system returns to it’s initial position
according to the laws of classical physics. The second time scale trev is the revival time. This is a time after which
the initial wave function will be partially or completely rebuilt. The third time scale tsr is the superrevival time.
It represents the time after which the wave function will be rebuilt in case that it is only partially rebuilt after the
revival time. For the most commonly investigated situations of the coherent superposition of Rydberg states and
tsr. But, as we will see, this time ordering
anharmonic oscillators the timescales are ordered so that Tcl ≪
changes for the coherent superposition of angular momentum states in an electric ﬁeld.

One particularly good thing about evolution of angular momentum wave packets is that we can know exactly and
to some extent, control by changing excitation geometry and polarization of excitation light, the cM distribution that
will occur in a realistic experiment.

As an example let us consider a so called Q-type of molecular transition when light excites molecules from the
ground state to the excited state and both states have the same value of angular momentum quantum number J. Let
us further assume that the exciting radiation is linearly polarized with the light vector e lying perpendicularly to an
external magnetic ﬁeld B. The probability of ﬁnding molecules in a particular angular momentum state YJM (θ, ϕ)
can be found by determining the diagonal elements of the density matrix fMM which give the population of angular
momentum substates characterized by a magnetic quantum number M (for details see Appendix I and [4,5])

III. ANGULAR MOMENTUM WAVE PACKETS IN A MAGNETIC OR AN ELECTRIC FIELD

EM (M ) = E(0) + gJ µBBM/¯h = E(0) + ELM.

Where E(0) is the energy of a state in the absence of the external ﬁeld. According to Eq.
(2.6) we can expect
classical period Tcl to be equal to 2π/EL = 2π/(gJ µBB/¯h). All other periods will be inﬁnite. Thus time evolution
of this angular momentum wave packet will be inﬁnitely long rotation around the external magnetic ﬁeld direction
with Larmor angular frequency ωL = 2π/Tcl. No changes apart from the rotation in space around the magnetic ﬁeld
direction will occur to the wave function. This is what actually has been observed experimentally in the past [10] as
a harmonic modulation of an intensity of a polarized ﬂuorescence from an ensemble of atoms or molecules excited by
a short laser pulse. This is a well known eﬀect of quantum beats induced by magnetic ﬁeld.

From the view point of an evolution of a wave packet, this result is similar to the well known behavior for coherent
states of a harmonic oscillator. In his pioneering paper Ervin Schrodinger wrote as early as in 1926, that wave packets
formed as coherent states of harmonic oscillator will oscillate inﬁnitely long between classical turning points without
dispersion, for references see [9]. The main reason for this is that the energies of quantum harmonic oscillator states
depend linearly on the vibration quantum number v. It means that only the ﬁrst derivative E′
v in the expansion of
type (2.5) will diﬀer from zero. In case of Zeeman eﬀect we observe the same linear energy dependence of the magnetic
sublevels of atomic or molecular states on the magnetic quantum number M . As a result, according to Eq. (2.6)
we have inﬁnitely long classical type motion of the wave packet that represent the precession of angular momentum
in a magnetic ﬁeld. One can easily calculate angular momentum distribution after the pulsed excitation following
equations (2.8) – (2.10). This result appears to be independent of the value of angular momentum quantum number

We have donut shape wave function that rotates in space around z axis with Larmor frequency ωL, Eq. (1.1) [5], see
Fig. 2. The fact that the result is independent of the angular momentum quantum number J is worth to mention.
It is interesting especially because this distribution coincides precisely with the result that would appear if we would
consider absorption of electric dipole oscillator in classical physics in the same circumstances.
Indeed, if instead
of considering artiﬁcial wave packets that can only be studied theoretically, we consider wave packets that can be
obtained in a realistic experiment it is not uncommon for the quantum and classical results coincide even for small
quantum numbers, see [5]. In classical approach this donut shape disrtibution of molecular axis can be understood if
one keeps in mind that for Q-type molecular transition in a classical approach absorbing dipole is oriented along J,
it means perpendicularly to the intermolecular axis of a rotationg molecule [5].

B. Molecule in an external electric ﬁeld

The evolution of a molecular wave packet in an external electric ﬁeld is quite distinct from the case of a magnetic
ﬁeld. For both cases we have the same amplitudes cM of partial components of wave function in Eq. (2.1) and the
same density matrix. But in case of an electric ﬁeld we will have a diﬀerent magnetic sublevel energy EM dependence
on the magnetic quantum number M . Let us consider molecule in a state experiencing a quadratic Stark shift. This
is a type of Stark eﬀect most commonly observed with atoms and molecules. In this case we will have an energy
dependence on the magnetic quantum number of the form

of wave function, but as well can be used to orient molecules in beams eﬀectively [13]. Probably other applications of
periodic behavior of atomic and molecular wave function in electric ﬁeld can be foreseen.

IV. SUMMARY

This paper points attention and illustrates two examples of angular momentum coherent wave packets that are of
grate interest due to their peculiar properties. They are less noticed than they deserve. These wave packets describe
precession of internuclear axes of diatomic molecules in an external ﬁeld.

The ﬁrst example was the angular momentum coherent superposition state created by the absorption of polarized
light by a molecule in an external magnetic ﬁeld. There are many examples of such wave packets created in experiments
for states of diatomic molecules [10]. But never has this situation of a coherent superposition of angular momentum
eigenstates been analyzed with the same machinery used to analyze the coherent superposition of Rydbaerg states
or coherent states of harmonic oscillator. In experiments with molecules absorbing light in permanent external ﬁelds
very often states with large rotational angular momentum quantum numbers of J
100 were involved. This allows
us to compare these states with behavior of a spinning particle in an external ﬁeld.

∝

It is known that classical angular momentum in an external magnetic ﬁeld will precess around the magnetic ﬁeld

direction with Larmor frequency ωL.

Quantum wave packet in a magnetic ﬁeld will experience the same motion. Period of rotation of wave packet will
coincide perfectly with period of precession of classical angular momentum. Wave packet will last for ever (actually
as long as the excited state of molecule will live). It will not undergo any disintegration.

5

There is known only one other example when the wave packet evolves in time without dispersion. It is a coherent
state of harmonic oscillator [9]. The reason for this type of motion in both cases is the same. All coherently excited
wave functions in these examples represent states that are equally separated in energy scale, i.e. the systems have
energy levels with equally separated steps.

Another example considered here was angular momentum states in an external electric ﬁeld causing a quadratic
Stark eﬀect.
In
quantum physics we will have periodical motion during which the wave function will periodically disintegrate and
than, after a deﬁnite period, will go through a revival.

In this case an ensemble of angular momentum will evolve aperiodically in classical physics [4].

This is quite unique dynamics.

It is more usual for systems to have a period of classical motion Tcl that is
substantially shorter than revival time trev, as is true for the Rydberg states or anharmonic oscillator states. It means
that during one revival period this type quantum system will undergo many classical periods. In the example of the
quadratic Stark eﬀect in an external electric ﬁeld, we have exactly the opposite extreme. The system has no classical
period at all. From the view point of classical physics the system is aperiodic. But quantum evolution of the wave
function still have a well deﬁned period which becomes longer and longer, when angular moment of system increases
and system approaches classical limit.

this product is very close to that of a scalar or dot product of two ordinary vectors. Only in this case we are dealing
with complex vectors and to ﬁnd the projection of one vector onto another or – which is the same – to ﬁnd “how
much of one vector is contained into another” we must calculate a Hermitian product.

We are using here complex vectors, because it is a simple way to describe rotations in quantum mechanics as well
as in classical physics. Let us see how these complex vectors and their components in a cyclic system of coordinates
[5,8] can be used to describe, for example, the polarization of light. An arbitrary light polarization vector (unit vector
e in the direction of the electric ﬁeld vector of the light wave) in cyclic coordinates can be written as

e+1 =

oscillations along x axis are quarter period ahead of those along y axis and this means that this component of the e
vector represents lefthanded circular polarized in xy plane light beam that propagates in the positive direction of z
axis. It means that a light wave in which electric ﬁeld vector rotates counterclockwise is viewed in such way that the
radiation approaches the observer in the positive direction of the z axis.

In a similar way one can see that the e−1 component represents righthanded circular polarized light that propagates

along z axis with the e vector rotating in a clockwise direction in the xy plane.

And ﬁnally, the e0 component represents linearly along z axis polarized light for which e oscillates along z axis.
Just as light e vector can be represent by its three Cartesian components, every vector can be represented by its three

components are more practical for calculation than the Cartesian representation.

Now let us turn back to the matrix elements of a type (5.2). According to vector algebra for cyclic vectors, the

Further for a matrix element
we can apply Wigner–Eckart theorem [5,8]. It allows to separate angular and

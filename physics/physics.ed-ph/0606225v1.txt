Abstract.
In this paper, we use the approximation of shallow water waves
(Margaritondo 2005 Eur. J. Phys. 26 401) to understand the behavior of a tsunami
in a variable depth. We deduce the shallow water wave equation and the continuity
equation that must be satisﬁed when a wave encounters a discontinuity in the sea
depth. A short explanation about how the tsunami hit the west coast of India is given
based on the refraction phenomenon. Our procedure also includes a simple numerical
calculation suitable for undergraduate students in physics and engineering.

Understanding the tsunami with a simple model

1. Introduction

Tsunamis are water waves with long wavelengths that can be triggered by submarine
earthquakes,
landslides, volcanic eruption and large asteroid impacts. These non-
dispersive waves can travel for thousands of kilometers from the disturbance area where
they have been created with a minimum loss of energy. As any wave, tsunamis can be
reﬂected, transmitted, refracted and diﬀracted.

The physics of a tsunami can be very complex, especially if we consider its creation
and behavior next to the beach, where it can break. However, since tsunamis are
composed of waves with very large wavelengths, sometimes greater than 100 km, they
can be considered as shallow waves, even in oceans with depths of a few kilometers.

The shallow water approximation simpliﬁes considerably the problem and still
allows us to understand a lot of the physics of a tsunami. Using such approximation,
Margaritondo [1] deduced the dispersion relation of tsunami waves extending a model
developed by Behroozi and Podolefsky [2]. Since energy losses due to viscosity and
friction at the bottom [3] can be neglected in the case of shallow waves, Margaritondo,
considering energy conservation, explained the increase of the wave height when a
tsunami approaches the coast, where the depth of the sea and the wave velocity are
both reduced.

In this paper we use one of the results of Ref.

[1] in order to deduce the wave
equation and include the variation of the seabed. Thus, we are able to explain the
increase of the wave amplitude when passing from deeper to shallow water. Also, we
discuss the refraction of tsunami waves. This phenomenon allowed the tsunami of
December 24, 2004, created at the Bay of Bengal, to hit the west coast of India (a
detailed description is given in [4]). These both inclusions - the seabed topography and
the wave refraction - where pointed out by Chu [5] as necessary to understand some
other phenomena observed in tsunamis.

This paper is organized as follows. The wave equation and the water ﬂux
conservation are used in section 2 in order to explain how and how much a shallow
wave increases when passing from a deeper to a shallow water. In section 3, we extend
the results obtained in section 2 to study how a wave packet propagates in a water tank
where the depth varies; in this section we use some numerical procedures that can be
extended to the study of any wave propagating in a non-homogeneous medium. Also,
the refraction of the 2004 tsunami in the south on India is discussed in section 3. The
shallow wave and the continuity equations are deduced in appendix A.

2. Reﬂection and transmission of waves in one dimension

Consider a perturbation on the water surface in a rectangular tank with a constant
depth.
In the limit of large wavelengths and a small amplitude compared with the
depth of the tank, the wave equation can be simpliﬁed to (see Appendix A)

∂2y
∂t2 = gh

∂2y
∂x2 ,

where y(x, t) is the vertical displacement of the water surface at a time t, propagating
in the x direction, g is the gravity acceleration and h is the water depth.

±

Equation (1) is the most common one-dimensional wave equation. It is a second-
order linear partial diﬀerential equation and, since g and h are constants, any function
vt) is a solution (v = √gh is the wave velocity). An interesting aspect of eq.
y = f (x
(1) is that a propagating pulse does not present a dispersion due to the same velocity
of all wavelengths and, thus, preserves its shape. Light in vacuum (and, in a very good
approximation, in air) is non-dispersive. Also, sound waves in the air are nearly non-
dispersive. (If dispersion was important in the propagation of the sound in the air, a
sound would be heard diﬀerent in diﬀerent positions, i.e., music and conversation would
be impossible)

However, the velocity of shallow-water wave varies with the depth. Thus, shallow-

water waves are dispersive in a non-uniform seadepth.

In order to study the evolution of a tsunami in a rectangular box with variable
depth, which will be detailed in the next section, we approximate the irregular depth by
successive steps. So, in the next paragraphs we will explain the treatment used when a
wave encounters a discontinuity.

Every time the tsunami encounters a step, part is transmitted and part is reﬂected.

Then, consider a wave with an amplitude given by y = cos(kx
respectively, the wave number and the frequency incoming in a region where the depth
of the water, and also the wave velocity, have a discontinuity as represented in Fig. 1.
On the left-side of the discontinuity the perturbation is given by

where v and v′ are the velocities of the wavepacket at the left and right sides of the

In order to determine R and T we must impose the boundary conditions at x = 0.
For any instant, the wave should be continuous at x = 0: cos ωt + R cos(ωt + ϕ1) =
T cos(
ωt + ϕ2). The same should happen with the ﬂux, f (x, t), given by (see eq.

(A.13))

f (x, t) = h

where z(x, t) is the horizontal displacement of a transversal section of water (see equation
(A.3) for the relation between z and y).

Imposing the boundary conditions y1(0, t) = y2(0, t) and f1(0, t) = f2(0, t) we can

deduce sin ϕ1 = sin ϕ2 = 0. Then choosing ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0 we obtain

It is worthwhile to mention here that other choices of ϕ1 and ϕ2 will change the
signs of R and T . However, in this case, it will also change the phases of the reﬂected
and transmitted waves. Both modiﬁcations will compensate themselves and the shape
of the wave will remain unchanged in relation of the choice ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0.

Reﬂection and transmission are very important eﬀects in wave propagation: every
time a traveling wave (light, water waves, pulses in strings, etc.)
encounters a
discontinuity in the medium where it propagates, reﬂection and transmission occur.
Since there is no energy losses, energy ﬂux is conserved. The energy of a wave is
proportional to the square of its amplitude [1]. Thus, the energy ﬂux is proportional to
the squared amplitude times the wave velocity. The energy ﬂux of the incident wave at
x = 0 is given by

(the amplitude of the incident wave was chosen as 1).

The reﬂected and transmitted energy ﬂux are given by

φtrans = T 2v′,

Using eqs. (7) and (8) it is immediate to show that

φinc = φref l + φtrans.

(12)

It is worthwhile to mention here that eqs. (7), (8) and (12) are classical textbook results
on wave at interfaces.

Fig. 1 shows the evolution of a wavepacket in three distinct situations: before ﬁnd
a step, passing the step and after passing the step. On the left side of x = 0 the depth is
2000 m and on the right side 10 m. We can note a growth of the wavepacket amplitude
after passing a step due to the velocity variation, in this case k′/k = 14, and, then
T = 1.9.

Using energy conservation, Margaritondo deduced that the wave amplitude, when
going from a sea depth h1 to h2, increases by the factor (h1/h2)1/4 [1]. According to
this result, the amplitude in our example should grow by a factor of 3.8. However, the
growth observed was 1.9. The diﬀerence is due to the fact that when a wave packet
encounters a discrete step of velocity, part of the energy is reﬂected (the reader can
verify that eq. (12) is satisﬁed). As will be shown in the next section, when the sea
depth varies smoothly, the reﬂected wave can be neglected, and our results becomes
equal to Margaritondo’s result.

3. Waves in a variable depth

In order to study the evolution of a tsunami when it propagates in a rectangular box
where the depth varies, we initially made a wavepacket propagating into a crescent x
direction. The variable depth was approximated by a succession of steps taken as narrow
as we wish.

The evolution of the wave packet was calculated as follows:

•

•

At time t, the wave packet amplitude y(x, t) was divided in n small discrete
transversal sections of length ∆x (in our case ∆x = 50000 m).

Every small part of the wave packet y(x, t) was investigated:

(i) If in a time interval ∆t it stays in the same velocity step, then the wave

packet at t + ∆t was simply increased by y(x, t) at the position x + v(x)∆t.

(ii) If in a time interval ∆t, we choose ∆t as 30 s, it encounters a velocity step,
part is reﬂected and part is transmitted. The reﬂected and transmitted parts were
calculated from eqs. (7) and (8) and added to the wave packet at t+∆t propagating
to the left or to the right, respectively. The step width and the time interval ∆t
were chosen such that never the reﬂected or transmitted parts encounter a second
step.

Figure 2. The upper frame (A) shows an initial wave packet traveling to the right.
The frames (B) and (C) show, respectively, the tsunami in an intermediary position
and near to the coast. The tsunami velocity is given by the dashed line. Note that
the wavepacket extension diminishes in the same proportion as the velocity. (Only the
progressive part of the wavepacket is shown).

Fig.

2 shows three positions of the right-propagating wavepacket (the left-
propagating was omitted). The initial wavepacket, ﬁg. 2A, has its center at a depth
of about 3930 m (v
200 m/s), then the center of the wavepacket goes to a position
where the depth is about 165 m (v
40 m/s), ﬁg. 2C. The growth of the amplitude
[1]
is about 1.7. The diﬀerence between our result and the one expected by Ref.
((3903/165)0.25 = 2.2) is due to the fact that we approximate the continuous depth
variation by discretes steps and, as a consequence, the left-propagating wavepacket was
not negligible.

4. Discussion

The tsunami of 26 December 2004, obviously, did not propagate in a rectangular
box, but, approximately, in a circular tank. As the tsunami propagates, its extension
increases and, in consequence, its amplitude diminishes. However, when it approaches
shallow waters, near to the coast, its amplitude grew up again as shown by the simpliﬁed
model developed in this paper.

The developed model depends on two approximations: the wave amplitude is small
and the length of the wavepacket is large when compared with the sea depth. Since the
ﬁrst approximation is not valid near the beach, we stopped the evolution when the front
part of the tsunami wavepacket attained a depth of about 50 m, shown in Fig. 2C.

In summary, with the model developed in this paper we showed how to use the
approximation of shallow water waves to a variable depth. This simple model allows
us to understand what occurs when a tsunami goes from deeper to shallow waters: the
velocity of the rear part of the wavepacket is larger than the velocity of its front part,
causing water to pile up. Also, refraction eﬀects, that are not present in a sea of constant
depth, can be observed near to the coast.

Appendix A. Deduction of the wave equation for waves with wavelengths
much greater than the water depth

We will deduce the wave equation in a simpliﬁed situation. We will make the following
approximations (all of them can be applied to tsunamis located far from the beach): the
part of the restoration force that depends on the surface tension can be neglected in the
case of waves with large wavelengths; the wavelength or the extension of the wavepacket
will be considered much longer than the depth of the water (in the case of tsunamis the
wavelengths and the ocean depth can have, approximately, hundreds of km and a few
km, respectively); the wave amplitude will be considered much smaller than the ocean
depth. Another simpliﬁcation is the tank where the wave propagates: we will consider
a wave propagating in a rectangular box with vertical walls and constant depth. In this
approximation of shallow water waves, all the droplets in the same transversal portion
have the same oscillatory horizontal motion along the x direction. Finally, friction at
the bottom will be neglected [3].

Fig. A1 illustrates the situation considered. The wave direction of propagation is

x; h0 is the unperturbed height of the water; L is the box width.

t + ∆t. z = z(x, t) is the horizontal displacement - along the x direction - of a vertical
lamellar slice with an equilibrium position at x. When the wave propagates, this part of
the water oscillates to left and right. Equaling the volume of water in ∆x and ∆x + ∆z,
we have:

Lh∆x = L(h + y)(∆x + ∆z)

= L(h∆x + h∆z + y∆x + y∆z).

If we consider y << h and ∆z << ∆x, then eq. (A.1) becomes

This last equation is the mass conservation equation of the ﬂuid and relates the vertical
displacement of the water surface, y, with the horizontal displacement of a vertical slice
of water.

To apply the second Newton Law to a small portion of the lamellar slice, ∆h, of
water (see Fig. A2), we should calculate the total force, ∆F , acting on it. This force
depends on the pressure diﬀerence between the opposite sides of the slice:

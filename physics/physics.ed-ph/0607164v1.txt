Dynamics and (de)localization in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain

Antonio ˇSiber∗
Institute of Physics, P. O. Box 304, 10001 Zagreb, Croatia

A simple tight-binding model is used to illustrate how the time dependence of a state vector
can be obtained from all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. The behavior of the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors is studied for various parameters and allows us to study scattering-like
events, impurity states, and localization in disordered systems.

I.

INTRODUCTION

For most physics students the Schr¨odinger representa-
tion of quantum mechanics is more appealing than the
matrix or Heisenberg representation. The reason is due
in part to the fact that the Schr¨odinger representation is
more suited for visualization.1,2 Also most students are
more accustomed to thinking in terms of functions rather
than in terms of abstract eigenvectors.

In this article I discuss a simple but versatile tight-
binding Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues, eigenvectors and
dynamics can be obtained and easily visualized in the
matrix representation. The solution of the physical sys-
tem represented by the Hamiltonian is obtained numer-
ically by using a short program that is given in Ap-
pendix A. The code allows for visualization of the spec-
trum of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and also the dynam-
ics generated by the Hamiltonian.

The model Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional chain
with nearest neighbor couplings is discussed in Sec. II
and a complete set of states describing the single parti-
cle dynamics is introduced. Section III brieﬂy describes
how the Hamiltonian generates the time dependence of
an initial state vector and demonstrates that the eigen-
values and eigenvectors deﬁne the dynamical behavior
of the system. In Sec. IV I discuss several applications
that are of pedagogical interest. In particular, the dy-
namics of a state initially localized on a particular site is
studied. The dynamics is correlated with the spectrum of
the Hamiltonian and properties of its eigenvectors (local-
ized versus delocalized). Several aspects of the problem
that are of research interest are discussed, including the
problems of localization and conductance in chain-like
molecules, such as DNA.

II. DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM

Consider the Hamiltonian:

H =

X
i

X
i

Eic†

i ci +

Ti[c†

i+1ci + c†

i ci+1],

(1)

where c†
i and ci are the creation and destruction opera-
tors of a particle on site i, respectively. The Hamiltonian
represents a chain of sites denoted by indices i; a particle

(2)

(3a)
(3b)
(3c)

can hop from one site to another due to the nonvanish-
ing values of Ti which are often called hopping matrix
elements.

We restrict our attention to a single particle (or, more
generally, an excitation) propagating through the chain.
The dynamics can be described in a position-occupation
basis, that a basis of states denoted by
such that

where i denotes a particular site occupied by an excita-
tion and N denotes the total number of sites. The action
of c-operators in this basis is simple:

to singly occupied states, we can equivalently (and with-
out reference to creation/destruction operators) repre-
sent the Hamiltonian as

The position-occupation basis does not diagonalize the
Hamiltonian in Eq. (1), except in the trivial case of Ti = 0
for all i. However, it is the basis that is simplest concep-
tually and most easy to visualize.

Equation (1) is a simpliﬁed tight-binding Hamiltonian
and is discussed in many textbooks on condensed matter
physics (see for example, Ref. 3). Its matrix representa-
tion is easy to construct. The simplest and numerically
most feasible way is to consider a tridiagonal matrix in
the position-occupation basis (Eqs. (2) and (3)) as

The Hamiltonian is represented in a basis of singly occu-
pied states; that is, we consider only this subset of states
of Fock space (which includes multiply occupied states;
for example, we might want to consider the dynamics
of two excitations). Note that the Hamiltonian deﬁned
in Eq. (1) cannot induce transitions between the Fock
subspaces corresponding to a diﬀerent total number of
excitations.

Periodic boundary conditions are not imposed in the
matrix representation in Eq. (5). Periodic boundary con-
ditions would require nonvanishing (1, N ) and (N, 1) el-
ements, that is, the upper right and the lower left corner
of the matrix. The matrix in Eq. (5) can be easily set
up and diagonalized numerically. It is enough to specify
only two arrays of real numbers, one of length N which
contains the diagonal values of the matrix, and the other
of length N
1 which contains the elements of the Hamil-
tonian matrix along its ﬁrst subdiagonal.

IV. APPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL

As mentioned, the matrix in Eq. (5) can be diagonal-
ized numerically. One possible way of doing so is de-
scribed in Appendix A, which lists a sample program to
set up the Hamiltonian matrix and diagonalize it. The
result of this numerical procedure is an array of N Hamil-
tonian eigenvalues ǫk and a N
N matrix (or 2D array)
, which provides a complete solution

I ﬁrst consider a completely regular chain, that is, a
chain in which Ei = E and Ti = T for all i. The char-
acteristic energies (E) and the hopping matrix elements
(T ) are set to E = e and T =
0.1e, where e denotes
the energy scale. Note that the chosen energy scale also
ﬁxes the characteristic time scale, which is given by ¯h/e
(see Eq. (13)). The results of this calculation are given
in Figs. 1 and 2. It is clearly observed how the initially
localized state delocalizes over many sites and eventu-
ally hits the right end of the chain, reﬂecting from it.
The horizontal axis in the plots is the site index which is
in principle unrelated to any characteristic length. The
spatial dimensions are hidden in the hopping (or over-
lap) matrix elements Ti; the more separated the atomic
orbitals Ei are, the smaller their overlap and the corre-
sponding hopping matrix element.3

Figure 2 displays the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
and three characteristic eigenvectors. Note the fast oscil-
latory behavior of the eigenvectors for high-energy states
(insets in (c) and (d) panels of Fig. 2). The eigenvalues of
the Hamiltonian are indistinguishable from the analytical
solution, which is given by6

ǫk = E + 2T cos[kπ/(N + 1)],

We assume that the wave function (or state vector) is
initially chosen to be localized on a particular site l of the

exact solution for the periodic tight-binding chain is3

ǫ(k) = E + 2T cos(2kπ/N ),

(k = 1, . . . , N )

(15)

Note the extra factor of 2 in the argument of the cosine
compared to Eq. (14) and that the eigenvalue ǫk has been
rewritten as ǫ(k), so that it appears as a function of the
eigenvalue index. In the periodic case, it makes sense to
characterize the eigenvalues by the wavevector, that is, k
becomes more than an eigenvalue index and has a direct
interpretation in terms of the characteristic wavelength
for each eigenstate. This issue is discussed in more detail
in Appendix B.

Note that Eqs. (14) and (15) are not very diﬀerent
for large N . In the limit of inﬁnite N , the band width,
deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the largest and smallest
eigenvalues, is the same in both cases, as well as the
density of states deﬁned as

ρ(ǫ) =

δ(ǫ

case in Eq. (14).

the eigenvector magnitude between the 100th and 120th sites
(these are blowups of the eigenvector magnitude in the regions
bounded by the two thin rectangles in the main plots).

B. One defect link in a chain, simulation of
scattering

In this subsection, a special link is introduced between
the 250th and 251st sites in a chain with total of N = 500
0.2e, and all other links are the
sites so that T250 =
same as before, Ti =
= 250 (the orbital
0.1e for all i, i
energies are Ei = e for all i, the same as in previous
subsection). This modiﬁcation of the hopping matrix
will allow us to study the eﬀects of the impurity link on
the eigenvalue spectrum and propagation of the initially
localized state.

The evolution of a state vector initially localized on the
ﬁrst chain site is displayed in Fig. 3. Note how part of
the probability density is reﬂected from site 250 and 251,
while the other part continues its propagation toward the
end of the chain.

The eigenvalue spectrum is shown in Fig. 4. Note the
appearance of two states that detach from the band. The
eigenvectors of two special states are also displayed in
Fig. 4. The two states separated from the band corre-
spond to the excitations that are localized on the special

C. Anderson’s diagonal disorder Hamiltonian

We now study a case in which randomness is intro-
duced in the Hamiltonian matrix. The orbital energies
Ei are given random values in a band of width W . Be-
cause these numbers are along the diagonal of the Hamil-
tonian, the model is said to have diagonal disorder. The
sub-diagonal matrix elements are the same as before
(Ti = T =
0.1e). There are a number of interesting
issues related to this model, one of which is called An-
derson localization. The suitably modiﬁed code in Ap-
pendix A can be used to study the Anderson’s diagonal
disorder Hamiltonian. The number of sites is increased
to N = 900 and the orbital energies along the diagonal
are given uniform random values in the interval [e, 2e],
that is, W = e.

−

One of the features of this problem is that all the eigen-
states of the Hamiltonian are localized.7,8 The eigenvalue
spectrum and three characteristic eigenvectors are shown
in Fig. 5. The fact that all the eigenvectors are localized
has a profound inﬂuence on the propagation of an ini-
tially localized state. Figure 6 displays an evolution of a

state vector initially localized on the ﬁrst chain site. Oc-
cupation probabilities for the ﬁrst 30 sites of the chain
are presented; the site occupation probabilities are negli-
gible beyond site 10. Note that the times shown are very
long (t = 1016¯h/e). We conclude that the propagation of
the excitation through the chain is not only slow, but is
eﬀectively blocked – the excitation remains localized in
the vicinity of the site at which it was initially created.7,8
The blockage of the excitation propagation is related to
the fact that the projection coeﬃcients (ak in Eq. (6)) of
the initially localized state have a signiﬁcant magnitude
only for several eigenstates whose localization on the ﬁrst
site is nonvanishing. One of those eigenvectors (the one
whose maximum magnitude is on the ﬁrst site) is very
similar to the initial state vector, and its projection coef-
ﬁcient is the largest and close to 1. Thus, the initial state
is almost an eigenstate and its evolution is thus slow. Be-
cause the projection coeﬃcients ak on eigenvectors that
are localized on sites that are very distant from the ﬁrst
chain site are close to zero, the propagation through the
chain is essentially blocked. The total number of the sites
that become occupied during the evolution (about 5 to 10
as is seen in Fig. 6) is related to the typical localization
width of the eigenvectors.

D. Recent research on chains in the tight-binding
scheme

It is interesting to see how the possible correlations
in the diagonal disorder distribution inﬂuence the na-
ture of the eigenvectors and the spectrum of eigenvalues
(see for example, Refs. 9 and 10). These eﬀects could
be studied with suitable changes of the code. The lo-
calization of electronic states due to disorder may drive
a metal-insulator transition (or Anderson transition) in
the system, and one-dimensional models similar to the
one discussed in this article are useful in the study of
random binary alloys.11 In this case there are only two
characteristic orbital energies and their appearance in the
chain is random (for example, the appearance of the A
orbital occurs with probability p, while the appearance
of the B orbital occurs with probability 1
p). For a
random binary alloy, the system again exhibit the local-
ization of eigenvectors, but correlations in the disorder
may introduce resonant states for which there is perfect
electron transmission through the system.

The electrical conduction of biological polymers, DNA
in particular, has also attracted much attention.11,12 An
electronic coupling induced through the overlap of πz or-
bitals perpendicular to the planes of the stacked base
pairs in double-stranded DNA can be simulated using the
simpliﬁed one-dimensional model in Eq. (1), although the
realistic situation is much more complicated due to the

FIG. 6: Time dependence of the probability distribution for
a chain with random orbital energies chosen from the interval
[e, 2e]. The time is measured in ¯h/e. Note that only the ﬁrst
30 sites of the chain with 900 sites are represented, because the
site occupation probabilities are negligible beyond the 10th
site.

inﬂuence of vibrations on the distances between the base
pairs and the importance of the electronic structure of
the DNA backbone.12,13,14,15 Models similar to the one
studied in this article are used to study the conduction
properties of DNA molecules.11

The model and the program in Appendix A can be
easily modiﬁed to study these problems. Correlations
in the diagonal disorder can be studied, as well as the
introduction of disorder along the sub-diagonals (hopping
matrix elements). Localization eﬀects can be studied in
cases when the width of the diagonal energy band W
is much smaller than the value of the hopping matrix
elements T . The opposite limit was studied in Sec. IV C.

APPENDIX A: A PROGRAM FOR THE STUDY
OF THE PROBLEM

The following code describes the numerical solution to
the problem. Due to the brevity of the code, it is listed
here along with comments. The source code can be com-
piled as g77 -o chain1 chain1.for -llapack or f77
-o chain1 chain1.for -llapack

The total number of sites in a chain (N ) is deﬁned
in line 5. The Hamiltonian matrix is deﬁned between
lines 7 and 14. The parameter thresh allows for the
introduction of random orbital matrix elements (lines 11–
13); for thresh = 0 the orbitals are regular, while for

thresh > 1 they are totally random within the ranges
deﬁned by line 12 (between 1 and 2 energy units).

The Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized in line 15 us-
ing the DSTEV LAPACK routine designed for the diag-
onalization of tridiagonal matrices.16 After the diagonal-

ization, the jth column of the matrix XI(i,j) contains
the eigenvector corresponding to the jth eigenvalue of
). The DSTEV routine sorts the
ξj
the Hamiltonian (
i
|
eigenvalues in an ascending order.

The time dependence of the initial state vector, one of
the vectors from the
basis in Eq. (2), is implemented
between lines 25 and 37. In particular, the part of the
program between lines 29 and 37 implements Eq. (13).
The initial state is speciﬁed by the variable l which rep-
resents the index of the occupied chain site at t = 0.

The output is written in the ﬁle timedat.dat which
can be plotted separately. This output was used to gen-
erate Figs. 1, 3, and 6. The CPU time needed to calcu-
late the probability distribution does not depend on the
physical time input (variable time) because the program
does not propagate a solution in the time domain. All
the calculations needed for the evolution of the initial
state vector are performed by the diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian matrix. This output is used to calculate
the probability distributions for arbitrary times t (see
Eq. (13)).

To implement the case of regular chain discused in sub-
section IV A, all randomness must be eliminated, and
thus, the thresh variable in line 6 is set to zero.

To simulate one special link (impurity or defect) in the
middle of the chain with N = 500 sites (the case studied
in subsection IV B), we introduce the following piece of
code in between the lines 13 and 14,

if (i .eq. 250) then

T(i) = -0.2

endif

The rest of the lattice is in a regular state, that is, line 6
which controls the amount of randomness in the chains
is still

thresh = 0.0D0

For the case of totally disordered chain with N = 900
sites studied in subsection IV C, lines 5 and 6 of the code
should be changed to

N = 900
thresh = 1.0D0

APPENDIX B: PERIODIC VERSION OF THE
REGULAR TIGHT-BINDING CHAIN

To obtain a chain that is periodic, we have to connect
the ﬁrst and the N th sites by the hopping matrix ele-
ments. Hence, the Hamiltonian matrix is no longer tridi-
agonal because it now contains nonvanishing (1, N ) and
(N, 1) elements. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is still
symmetric. The periodic chain is easily programmed us-
ing techniques similar to those described in Appendix A
(the code can be obtained from the author). For the peri-
odic case the upper (or lower) triangle of the Hamiltonian

The results for a regular periodic chain are shown in
Fig. 7 and compared with the case studied in Sec. IV A.
The parameters of the calculation are E = e, T =
0.1e,
and N = 100. The results are used to illustrate sub-
tleties discussed at the end of Sec. IV A. Note that the
eigenvalue spectra look indistinguishable, but a closer in-
spection (inset in Fig. 7(a)) reveals that the spectrum
corresponding to the periodic chain is doubly degenerate
(except for the lowest and highest energy eigenvalue),
which is not the case for the nonperiodic chain, in agree-
ment with the discussion in Sec. IV A. The eigenvectors
corresponding to the lowest and highest energy eigenstate
are also diﬀerent (which is true for all eigenvectors) al-
though the energies of these states are similar in the two
cases, see Eqs. (14) and (15)). For the periodic chain the
lowest energy eigenvector can be written in the position-
occupation basis as

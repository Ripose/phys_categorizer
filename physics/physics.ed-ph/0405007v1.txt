I. INTRODUCTION

This paper demonstrates that there is much similarity between the mathematical structures of optical constants of
artiﬁcial electromagnetic media (such as chiral media, left-handed media, photonic crystals and EIT media) and some
physical phenomena in ﬁeld theory, including general relativity, quantum mechanics, energy band theory, etc.. The
aim of this paper is to show that the uniﬁcation in mathematical descriptions can clue us to the discovery of some
new physical eﬀects, by analogy with those in other ﬁelds.

We consider four strong resemblances in the mathematical structures between the artiﬁcial electromagnetic media

and the physical phenomena in ﬁeld theory:

(i) the generalization of the constitutive relation of regular media to that of chiral media resembles the extension of
the ﬂat Minkowski metric to the curved-spacetime metric of Riemann spacetime. In other words, the oﬀ-diagonal terms
in the mathematical formalism of the electromagnetic energy density in chiral media arises from such a generalization;
(iii) since the stationary Maxwellian equation of the time harmonic wave strongly resembles the stationary
Schr¨odinger equation of matter waves, if the optical refractive index of media is periodic in space, then such me-
dia will give rise to the so-called photonic band gap structure. This kind of materials is called the photonic crystals;
0c4 and n2 = ǫµ will also have
physical meanings and therefore should not be discarded. For example, for the former relation E2 = p2c2 + m2
0c4, the
negative energy solutions indicate the existence of the antiparticle of electron, and for the latter n2 = ǫµ, the negative
solutions corresponds to a new kind of artiﬁcial composite materials, which possess negative refractive indices. This
kind of materials is referred to as the left-handed media or negative refractive index media;

(iii) the negative solutions of any quadratic-form relations such as E2 = p2c2 + m2

(iv) the similarity between EIT and superconductivity is interesting. We show that the eﬀective Hamiltonian
(describing the eﬀective interaction between the two ground states of the three-level system) and the BCS Hamiltonian
have features that are almost the same. In addition, we take into account the destructive interference in both Cabbibo’s
theory (1963) and GIM mechanism (1970) of the Weak Interaction. We state that there exists the similar destructive
interferences in CPT and EIT. The mathematical formalisms of these destructive interferences in Weak Interaction
and atomic ensembles are almost alike.

The signiﬁcance of the above four comparisons between the current typical subjects in materials science and those
in ﬁeld theory lies in that: (i) the uniﬁcation in mathematical descriptions shows that many physical phenomena and
eﬀects, which seem to have no connections between them, actually share almost the same mathematical structures;
(ii) it can provide clue to us on suggesting more new eﬀects which is similar in mathematical descriptions to the
familiar phenomena in other areas.

II. CHIRAL MEDIA

According to the Maxwellian electrodynamics, the energy density of electromagnetic ﬁelds in electromagnetic media
is written W = (1/2) (E
B). For a linear medium, the relation between the electric displacement vector D
and the electric ﬁeld strength E is D = ǫǫ0E, and H = B/µµ0 between the magnetic induction H and the magnetic
ﬁeld strength B. Thus the energy density of electromagnetic ﬁelds in this medium can be rewritten as the following
matrix form

D + H

·

In the chiral media, however, the electromagnetic properties can be characterized by another constitutive relations.

This means that the electromagnetic-parameter matrix of the chiral media can be considered as the oﬀ-diagonal
generalization of the diagonal electromagnetic-parameter matrix of the regular linear materials, that is, we have

It should be noted that the above fact is of much interest, since it is similar to the curved-spacetime generalization
for the metric from the ﬂat spacetime: speciﬁcally, in the two dimensional Minkowski spacetime, the line element
squared can be given as

Note that here the metric matrix is diagonal. However, in the Riemann spacetime, the metric matrix has the oﬀ-
diagonal elements g10 and g01, and in consequence, the line element squared is given

Apparently, there exists a nontrivial extension of metric from the ﬂat Minkowski spacetime to the Riemann spacetime,
i.e.,

This generalization is just the development of special relativity (1905) to the general relativity (1916). We think there
is some interesting similarity between (2.4) and (2.7), at least in the research fashion of looking for potentially new
(and general) physical phenomena, eﬀects and mechanisms.

Hence, here we gave an illustrative example which demonstrates how one can suggest more new eﬀects which is

similar in mathematical descriptions to the familiar phenomena in other areas.

It is well known that the stationary Maxwellian equation for a time harmonic wave in a medium is exactly analogous
to the stationary Schr¨odinger equation of electrons in a potential ﬁeld, namely, the following equation (with the
magnetic permeability µ = 1)

In the solid state physics, a theorem (Bloch’s theorem) relating to the quantum mechanics of crystals, where large
numbers of atoms are held closely together in a lattice, states that the wave function for an electron in a periodic
potential V (r) can be rewritten as the product of the space harmonic factor exp (ik
r) and a periodic function.
Thus, Bloch’s theorem is interpreted to mean that the wave function for an electron in a periodic potential ﬁeld is a
plane wave modulated by a periodic function. It follows that the energy function of electrons with a lattice-periodicity
Hamiltonian is necessarily multivalued, and separates into branches or bands. This, therefore, means that in a crystal,
electrons are inﬂuenced by a number of adjacent nuclei and the sharply deﬁned levels of the atoms become bands of
allowed energy. Each band, which represents a large number of allowed quantum states, is separated from neighboring
band by a forbidden band of energies, i.e., between the bands are forbidden bands. The energy band theory is the
fundamental approach to crystal and semiconductor physics.

·

In view of the above discussion, we can inevitably draw our inspiration from the analogy between (3.2) and (3.3):
if, for example, the electric permittivity (and hence the electric susceptibility χ) of a certain media is of the lattice-
periodicity structure, then the media will generate a photonic band gap phenomenon, which would be of interest to
many researchers in materials science, electromagnetism and solid state physics. Indeed, during the last decades, a
kind of material termed photonic crystals, which is patterned with a periodicity in dielectric constant and can therefore
create a range of forbidden frequencies called a photonic band gap, focus considerable attention of a great number of
investigators [1]. Such dielectric structure of crystals oﬀers the possibility of molding the ﬂow of light inside media.
It has many impressive and striking applications, including the reﬂecting dielectric, resonant cavity, waveguide and
so on.

The ﬁeld of photonic crystals is a marriage of solid-state physics and electromagnetism. Crystal structures are
citizens of solid-state physics, but in photonic crystals the electrons are replaced by electromagnetic waves. We can
see that the concept of the photonic crystals could be inspired by that of the electronic crystals.

IV. LEFT-HANDED MEDIA

The antiparticle is a subatomic particle that has the same mass as another particle and equal but opposite values of
some other property or properties. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the positron, which has a positive
charge equal in magnitude to the electron’s negative charge. Historically, the existence of antiparticles was predicted
from the relativistic quantum mechanics by Dirac in 1928. It is well known that Einstein’s energy-momentum relation
for a particle is of quadratic form, i.e., E2 = p2c2 + m2
0c4. From the purely mathematical point of view, E has two
0c4. In the physics of the 19th century, such a negative root could be regarded as a one
roots, i.e., E± =
that has no physical meanings and could be discarded without any hesitation. In quantum mechanics, however, the
completely diﬀerent things may occur. By solving Dirac’s electron wave equation, one can ﬁnd that there are solutions
0c4.
corresponding to the negative root
If someone discards the solutions corresponding to the negative energy root, then the completeness condition of the
solutions of the wave equation no longer holds. Such a fact shows that the only retained solutions (corresponding to
the positive energy) is not self-consistent in mathematics, and therefore no functions can be expanded as series in
terms of the solutions corresponding to the positive energy root only. For this reason, we think the negative-energy
solutions of Dirac’s equation should not be discarded. Further analysis shows that these negative-energy solutions
belong to a particle that has a positive charge and an equal mass of the electron. This particle is just the positron,
the antiparticle of the electron.

The above brief history of the prediction of antiparticle will unavoidably enlighten us about a lesson:

for any
physical phenomena, the mathematical relations of which possess quadratic forms, we should pay more attention to
one of the two roots, which, at ﬁrst sight, seems to have no explicit physical meanings. If we consider it further, it

3

(4.2)

may be possible for us to ﬁnd its hidden physical meanings and even to discover another half world, which had never
been familiar to us before. As far as the negative-energy solutions of Dirac’s equation is concerned, the anti-matter
world was discovered by Dirac.

Now let us take into account of the quadratic relation between the optical refractive index n and the electric

permittivity ǫ and magnetic permeability µ, i.e.,

The solutions has four categories, which are listed as follows

With the help of Maxwellian equations, one can discover that only the cases of n1 = +√ǫµ and n4 =

can allow the wave propagation in media. So, here we will not further consider the solutions n2 and n3. If both ǫ and
µ are positive numbers, then it follows that there may exist a new kind of electromagnetic materials, which possess
negative electric permittivity, negative magnetic permeability and hence negative optical index of refraction!

Now let us turn to the history of research of this new electromagnetic media: more recently, a kind of artiﬁcial
composite metamaterials (the so-called left-handed media) having a frequency band where the eﬀective permittivity
and the eﬀective permeability are simultaneously negative attracts considerable attention of many authors both
experimentally and theoretically [2–12]. In 19671, Veselago ﬁrst considered this peculiar medium and showed from
Maxwellian equations that such media possessing negative simultaneously negative ǫ and µ exhibit a negative index
of refraction [13].
It follows from the Maxwell’s curl equations that the phase velocity of light wave propagating
inside this medium is pointed opposite to the direction of energy ﬂow, that is, the Poynting vector and wave vector
of electromagnetic wave would be antiparallel, i.e., the vector k, the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld H form a
left-handed system; thus Veselago referred to such materials as “left-handed” media, and correspondingly, the ordinary
medium in which k, E and H form a right-handed system may be termed the “right-handed” one. Other authors call
this class of materials “negative-index media (NIM)” [14], “double negative media (DNM)” [5] and Veselago’s media.
It is readily veriﬁed that in such media having both ε and µ negative, there exist a number of peculiar electromagnetic
and optical properties, for instance, many dramatically diﬀerent propagation characteristics stem from the sign change
of the optical refractive index and phase velocity, including reversal of both the Doppler shift and Cherenkov radiation,
anomalous refraction, modiﬁed spontaneous emission rates, unconventional photon tunnelling eﬀect, ampliﬁcation of
evanescent wave and even reversals of radiation pressure to radiation tension [3].
In experiments, this artiﬁcial
negative electric permittivity media may be obtained by using the array of long metallic wires (ALMWs) [15], which
simulates the plasma behavior at microwave frequencies, and the artiﬁcial negative magnetic permeability media may
be built up by using small resonant metallic particles, e.g., the split ring resonators (SRRs), with very high magnetic
polarizability [16–18]. A combination of the two structures yields a left-handed medium. Recently, Shelby et al.
reported their ﬁrst experimental realization of this artiﬁcial composite medium, the permittivity and permeability
of which have negative real parts [4]. One of the potential applications of negative refractive index materials is to
fabricate the so-called “superlenses” (perfect lenses): speciﬁcally, a slab of such materials may has the power to focus
all Fourier components of a 2D image, even those that do not propagate in a radiative manner [19,20].

In the paper [21], we have demonstrated that the electromagnetic wave propagation in the negative refractive
index media behaves like that of antiphotons, which implies that in certain artiﬁcial composite metamaterials (such
as the left-handed media )the complex vector ﬁeld theory will be a very convenient theoretical tool for taking into
consideration the wave propagation behavior (e.g., scattering, transmission and refraction).

The investigation of the antiparticle solutions of Dirac equation means the discovery of another half matter world.
Similarly, the consideration of the negative optical constants (ǫ, µ, n) means the discovery of another half material
world.

Note that, in the literature, some authors mentioned the wrong year when Veselago suggested the left-handed media. They
claimed that Veselago proposed or introduced the concept of left-handed media in 1968 or 1964. On the contrary, the true
history is as follows: Veselago’s excellent paper was ﬁrst published in Russian in July, 1967 [Usp. Fiz. Nauk 92, 517-526
(1967)]. This original paper was translated into English by W.H. Furry and published again in 1968 in the journal of Sov.
Phys. Usp. [13]. Unfortunately, Furry stated erroneously in his English translation that the original version of Veselago’ work
was ﬁrst published in 1964.

V. EIT MEDIA

Controlling the phase coherence in ensembles of multilevel atoms has led to the observation of many striking phe-
nomena in the propagation of near-resonant light. These phenomena include the coherent population trapping (CPT),
lasing without inversion, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), and anomalously slow and anomalously fast
pulse velocities [22]. Here we will brieﬂy discuss the coherent population trapping (CPT) and electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT).

The CPT phenomenon can be observed in a simple three-level atomic system. The Hamiltonian of such a three-level

quantum system in the interaction picture is given as

It is apparently seen that the mechanism of atomic CPT is just the destructive interference. Such a state (5.2), which
can be said to be decoupled to the electromagnetic ﬁelds, is called the dark state (non-coupling state or trapped
state). Once the three-level atom is in the dark state, the transitions from the ground states to the excited will not
occur, and consequently this atomic ensemble will not absorb the near-resonant lase ﬁelds propagating inside it.

EIT is such a quantum optical phenomenon that if we propagate one laser beam through a medium and it will
get absorbed; but if we propagate two laser beams instead through the same medium and neither will be absorbed.
Thus the opaque medium is turned into a transparent one. The physical essence of EIT is just the CPT. According
to the theoretical analysis of multilevel atomic phase coherence, the requirement of the occurrence of EIT is that the
strength of coupling light is much stronger than that of probe light [23,24]. This requirement can be interpreted as
follows: it follows that if the laser ﬁeld Ea is much stronger than Eb, then the dark state

Hamiltonian in the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer) theory of superconductivity. The BCS theory shows that the

Cooper pairs. It is seemingly seen that the EIT phenomenon is truly analogous to the superconductivity. Moreover,
their eﬀective interaction Hamiltonians are almost alike. In EIT, the two photons of Ea and Eb ﬁelds seem to form a

Now let us consider Cabbibo’s theory (1963) [26] and the GIM mechanism (1970) in Weak Interaction. Cabbibo’s
theory shows that in the weak interaction, the d and s quarks actually behave like the mixed ones d′ and s′, which
are the linear combinations

d′ = d cos θc + s sin θc,

s′ =

d sin θc + s cos θc,

−

where θc denotes the Cabbibo angle. This means that the existing form of d and s quarks in the weak interaction is
in fact the d′ and s′ rather than the d and s itself. So, the interaction eigenstates of the above two quarks in the weak
interaction is just the d′ and s′ rather than the d and s. Thus the interaction weak current between d′ and u is given

¯uγµ (1 + γ5) d′ = ¯uγµ (1 + γ5) (d cos θc + s sin θc) .

The coupling constant of the d¯u coupling, in which the strangeness number does not change (∆S = 0), is GF , and the
coupling constant of the s¯u coupling, where the strangeness number changes (∆S = 1), is G′
F . Here GF = Gµ cos θc,
G′
F = Gµ sin θc, where Gµ is the coupling constant of the purely leptonic process (universal coupling constant in the
weak interaction). Thus the Fermi transition amplitude of d′

u decay is proportional to

cos θcGF + sin θcG′

→
F = Gµ,

while the transition amplitude of s′

u decay is vanishing, i.e.,

→
sin θcGF + cos θcG′

−

F =

−

Gµ (sin θc cos θc

cos θc sin θc) = 0.

−

In other words, the s′ quark can be said to be steady for the case of decay into u. This, therefore, means that in
the weak interaction, it is more reasonable and convenient for (d′, s′) to represent the interaction eigenstate than for
(d, s).

In 1970’s, in the experiments physicists found that all the weak-interaction neutral current processes satisfy the
selection rule of ∆S = 0, while the neutral current process of ∆S = 1 could rarely be observed. In accordance with
the uds three-quark theory, however, there should exist the neutral current process of ∆S = 1. For example, the
weak-interaction matrix element of neutral currents u¯u

z0 takes the form

conﬂict between theory and experiments? In 1970, Glashow et al. proposed a mechanism (which is now known as
GIM mechanism) and supposed that there exists a new quark (c) that had not been discovered in Nature. In the
GIM mechanism, (u, d′) and (c, s′) form the weak-interaction doublets, respectively, i.e.,

which demonstrates that the neutral current of ∆S = 1 is automatically eliminated and will therefore not exist in the
weak interaction. In a word, the introduction of c quark leads to the destructive interference of the neutral current of
∆S = 1 among the weak-interaction doublets (u, d′) and (c, s′). Thus, the GIM mechanism resolves successfully the
above conﬂict between the uds three-quark theory and the experiments.

We think the destructive interference is one of the common features in EIT (CPT) and Cabbibo’s theory and GIM

mechanism.

Diﬃcult Problems Having Easy Solutions

Abstract

We discuss how a class of diﬃcult kinematic problems can play an important role in an

introductory course in stimulating students’ reasoning on more complex physical situations.

The problems presented here have an elementary analysis once certain symmetry features of

the motion are revealed. We also explore some unexpected directions these problems lead us.

Key Words: Plane Motion, Central Force Motion

PACS numbers: 01.40.-d, 01.40.Fk, 01.55.+b.

There is a class of kinematical problems whose general analysis lies beyond the level of under-

graduate students but which nonetheless can play an important role in introductory courses. This

happens because the problems involve certain symmetry features that allow for an easy solution

once the symmetry is revealed.

What makes these problems worth mentioning here is that they are particularly useful in stimulat-

ing students’ reasoning on richer physical situations.

Consider this typical example.

A boat crosses a river of width l with velocity of constant magnitude u always aimed toward a point
S on the opposite shore directly across its starting position. If the rivers also runs with uniform
velocity u, how far downstream from S does the boat reach the opposite shore?

Fig. 1 depicts the situation when the boat is at point B in its path RV toward the opposite shore.

Its velocity vector along BS makes an angle θ with RS. The river velocity is represented along TB.

The (easy) solution comes from the observation that in a time interval ∆t the distance BS of the
boat to the point S on the opposite shore diminishes by (u − u cos θ)∆t, while, at the same time,

its distance TB to T increases by the same amount, thus keeping the sum BS + T B constant

throughout the trip along RV. Since it is clear that at the starting position BS = l and T B = 0,

while at the ﬁnal position BS = BT = d, which is the distance downstream, we conclude that

d = l/2 (See [1] for further examples).

The importance of this example lies in its far-reaching scope. For instance, many problems in

central force motion (planetary motion) can be formulated in similar terms, and the same kind of

analysis applies as well. Note the similarity we obtain if we turn the boat of the example into a

comet describing a parabolic orbit around a sun S in the focus, as in Fig. 2. In this case, it is the

component velocities along TB and normal to SB that are constants throughout the orbit (Compare

with Fig. 1). As a result we learn that now the sum of the distances SB + BP is constant along

the comet’s orbit. This fact deﬁnes the parabolic orbit and, with SB = r and BP = r cos θ, yields

its equation in polar coordinates as r(1 + cos θ) = const.

We can go still further to realize that a parabolic orbit is unstable under the inﬂuence of possible

nearby planets, and may be easily converted into an ellipse or an hyperbola, according to whether

the velocity of the comet decreases or increases as a result of the planetary perturbation [2]. When

this happens, the pattern of constant velocity components, u parallel to a ﬁxed direction (as BT),

and v normal to the radius vector BS, is preserved in the new orbit. The diﬀerence is that these

two velocities will not be equal to each other any more, and the ratio u/v will determine the shape

of the orbit (though not its size), being an ellipse when u/v < 1, and a hyperbola when u/v > 1.

We leave it to the reader to explore other features of planetary motion opened up by our example.

Fermat’s principle and variational analysis is used to analyze the trajec-

tories of light propagating in a radially inhomogeneous medium with a sin-

gularity in the center. It is found that the trajectories are similar to those

around a black hole, including the feature of an unstable photon orbit, from

which light spirals into the optical black hole.

I. INTRODUCTION

There has recently been much interest focused on the extra-ordinary properties associated

with Bose-Einstein condensates - clouds of atoms cooled down to nano-Kelvin temperatures

where all atoms are in the same quantum state and macroscopic quantum conditions prevail,

One of the most dramatic experiments which has been performed in Bose-Einstein conden-

sates is the demonstration of optical light pulses traveling at extremely small group velocities

e.g. velocities as small as 17 m/s have been reported, [2].

In a physically suggestive application of the optical properties of Bose-Einstein condensates,

it was recently suggested that they could be used to create, in the laboratory, dielectric

analogues of relativistic astrophysical phenomena like those associated with a black hole,

[1,2].

[3].

The astrophysical concept of a black hole is one of the most fascinating and intriguing phe-

nomena related to the interaction between light and matter within the framework of general

relativity. Black holes are believed to form when compact stars undergo complete gravita-

1

tional collapse due to, e.g., accretion of matter from its surroundings (in general relativity,

the pressure contributes to the gravitational mass of a ﬂuid, and an increased pressure will,

after a certain point, therefore only help to accelerate the collapse phase). The picture of

a black hole swallowing light and matter without conveying any direct information of its

existence is an awesome physical illustration of Shakespear’s famous metaphor of Death –

“The undiscovered country from which no traveler returns.”

In ordinary dielectric media, unrealistic physical conditions would be required in order

to demonstrate any of the spectacular eﬀects of general relativity. However, in dielectric

media characterized by very small light velocities, new possibilities appear. In particular,

it was recently suggested that by creating a vortex structure in such a dielectric medium

it is possible to mimic the properties of an optical black hole [3]. What this study in

fact showed was that one could construct, by using the aforementioned vortex, an unstable

photon orbit, much like the orbit at a radius r = 3M in the Schwarschild geometry [4]. In

order to construct an event horizon, one would need to supplement the vortex ﬂow by a

radial motion of the ﬂuid [5,6]. In this paper, though, we will on the grounds of simplicity

only analyze the ﬂuid with vortex motion. One could generalize this study by including an

angular dependence in the refractive index of the dielectric medium (see Sec.II).

The vortex, which involves a rotating cylindrical velocity ﬁeld, tends to attract light

propagating perpendicular to its axis of rotation and to make it deviate from its straight

path.

In the model considered in Refs. [1,3], the increasing, in fact diverging, rotational

velocity ﬁeld of the vortex core attracts light by the optical Aharanov–Bohm eﬀect and causes

a bending of the light ray similar to that of the gravitational ﬁeld in general relativity. It is

also shown that there exists a critical radius, rcrit, from the vortex core with the properties

that, if light rays come closer to the core than rcrit,the light will fall inescapably towards

the singularity of the vortex core.

In this sense, the critical radius, rcrit, plays the role

of an optical unstable photon orbit, analogous to the unstable orbit in the Schwarzschild

geometry.

The basic physical eﬀect involved in the analysis of the ray propagation in Refs. [1,3]

2

is the fact that the refractive index, n of a medium changes when the medium is moving.

In Refs. [1,3], the medium is assumed to have a cylindrical vortex velocity ﬁeld V = V(r)

given by

V(r) =

W

where r is the radius from the vortex core centre,

ϕ is the azimuthal unit vector and 2πW

is the vorticity.

Advanced physical concepts like Bose-Einstein condensates, vortex velocity ﬁelds and

black holes are fascinating physical eﬀects, which however may be diﬃcult to present in a

simpliﬁed manner for undergraduate students. Nevertheless, it is important to try to convey

inspiration for and arouse curiosity in such phenomena. An interesting example of such an

eﬀort was recently made in Ref. [7], where the basic physical mechanism, in the form of

a classical two level system, was used to demonstrate the possibility of the very low light

velocities observed in Bose- Einstein condensates. The purpose of the present work is similar

to that of Ref. [7]. We will try to give a simple classical example of a medium where the

refractive index has a divergence at r = 0 and which exhibits some of the dramatic properties

of the light behaviour around a black hole as discussed in Refs. [1,3,5,6]. In addition we

want to illustrate the power and beauty of the classical principle of Fermat and of variational

methods in connection with these new concepts.

II. FERMAT’S PRINCIPLE

It is well known that light tends to be deﬂected towards regions with higher refractive

index. Consider light propagating in a cylindrically symmetric medium where the refractive

index increases towards the centre.

In such a situation we expect the light path to look

qualitatively as in Fig. 1. The actual light path is determined by Fermat’s principle, i.e.,

where n(r) is the refractive index and ds is an inﬁnitesimal element along the light ray.

We will consider light propagation in a medium where the refractive index is of the

qualitative form, cf Eq. (1)

Using Fermat’s principle and expressing the light path as the relation θ = θ(r) where θ is

the polar angle, Eq. (2) implies

The Euler-Lagrange variational equation corresponding to Eq. (5) reads

which determines the trajectory of the light.

where the constant b is determined by initial conditions, i.e., the properties of the incident

For a light ray incident as shown in Fig. 1, we clearly have dθ/dr < 0 (at least up to some

minimum radius r = rmin). It is illustrative to ﬁrst consider the trivial case of a homogeneous

medium with n(r)

IV. FINAL COMMENTS

The present analysis is inspired by recent discoveries and discussions about light propaga-

tion in Bose-Einstein condensates where extremely low light velocities can be obtained. This

has triggered speculations about possible laboratory demonstrations of eﬀects, which nor-

mally are associated with general relativistic conditions. In particular, it has been suggested

that it should be possible to create the analogue of a black hole using a divergent inspiral of

a Bose-Einstein condensate. In the present work we have analyzed a simple classical exam-

ple of light propagation as determined by Fermat’s principle in a medium characterized by

a radially symmetric refractive index. In analogy with the variation of the vortex velocity

ﬁeld, the refractive index is assumed to diverge towards the centre. This classical example

exhibit some of the characteristic properties of light propagating around a black hole where

the gravitational attraction deﬂects the light and where, under certain conditions, the light

may be “swallowed” by the black hole. In the example analyzed here, the unstable photon

orbit of the Schwarzschild black hole corresponds to the characteristic radius, r0, of the re-

fractive index variation, which together with the impact parameter, ri, of the incident light

completely determines the light trajectory. If r0 < ri, the light is more or less deﬂected, but

ultimately escapes. However, if r0

ri, the light spirals into the singularity. One should

≥

also point out that this result is dependent on the singularity in the refractive index (4). If

this is removed, the unstable photon orbit also disappears. As noted earlier, to solve this

7

problem, a radial ﬂow in the condesate has to be introduced. The investigation is based

on Fermat’s principle and variational analysis, in this way illustrating the use of classical

methods in connection with very new and fascinating concepts at the front line of modern

research.

Abstrat. This artile reports on a student summer pro jet performed in 2006 at

the University of Frankfurt. It is addressed to undergraduate students familiar with

the basi priniples of relativisti quantum mehanis and general relativity. The

aim of the pro jet was to study the Dira equation in urved spae time. To obtain

the general relativisti Dira equation we use the formulation of gravity as a gauge

theory in the (cid:28)rst part. After these general onsiderations we restrit the further

disussion to the speial ase of the Shwarzshild metri. This setting orresponds to

the hydrogen atom, with the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld replaed by gravity. Although there

is a singularity at the event horizon it turns out that a regular solution of the time

independent Dira equation exists. Finally the Dira equation is solved numerially

using suitable boundary onditions.

1. Introdution

The most important suess in the early days of quantum mehanis was the appropriate

desription of the hydrogen atom. It is not exaggerated to say that quantum mehanis

was disovered in its (cid:28)nal form in the 1920ies in the attempt to desribe the hydrogen

atom whih ould not be understood in terms of a lassial theory.

To desribe the behaviour of an eletron with the help of quantum mehanis

means to solve the time independent Shrödinger equation (respetively the Dira

equation in the relativisti ase) with a oupled Coulomb potential and thus to (cid:28)nd

the eigenstates of the orresponding Hamiltonian. The existene of bound states within

an atom has fundamental importane sine it is the reason for the stability of matter.

So it is suggestive to onsider a similar situation, namely the behaviour of an eletron

within a spherial symmetri gravitational (cid:28)eld. Sine gravitation is muh weaker than

eletromagnetism (about a fator of 1043

in ase of the mass and the harge of an

eletron) the body being the soure of the gravitational (cid:28)eld must have a huge mass to

lead to an e(cid:27)et of the same order of magnitude as in the eletromagneti ase. The

most massive ob jets known today are blak holes.

Although the situation is in a ertain sense similar to the ase of the hydrogen

atom, to desribe gravitation one has to use general relativity instead of Maxwell

theory. Therefore, the problem beomes muh more involved beause of the fundamental

di(cid:27)erene between the framework of eletromagnetism and general relativity. In the ase

of general relativity one annot simply ouple a potential to the Hamiltonian but the

struture of spae time itself is hanged by the presene of a massive body. This leads to

a metri tensor gµν(x) whih di(cid:27)ers from the usual metri of (cid:29)at Minkowski spae time
ηµν = diag(+1, −1, −1, −1). The struture of spae time near a spherial symmetri

body is desribed by the Shwarzshild metri. In the ase of the Klein-Gordon equation

the metri appears expliitly in the equation and one has to replae the Minkowski

metri by the Shwarzshild metri to obtain the orret equation adapted to the new

situation. The situation is very di(cid:27)erent in the ase of the Dira equation, beause

the metri tensor does not appear expliitly in the Dira equation. Besides this the

Dira equation does not desribe a salar valued state but a Spinor. I.e. that we have

to inorporate the e(cid:27)et of the new metri on the Spinor spae. So the situation is

more di(cid:30)ult than in the ase of the Klein-Gordon equation where the new metri has

just to be inserted. Therefore we will have to derive the general form of the Dira

equation in urved spae time by onsidering the gauge formulation of general relativity

as mentioned above. This is the sub jet of the seond setion. After this we will explore

the speial ase of the Shwarzshild metri and look for a suitable representation to get

an equation whih is as simple as possible.

However the hanging of the metri must have an e(cid:27)et similar to the oupling

of a potential. Indeed, as will be shown below, the Dira equation takes the form of

the free Dira equation with an additional perturbative term in the Hamiltonian when

a ertain representation is hosen.

It remains the task to solve the equation. The

main reason why it is more di(cid:30)ult to solve this problem ompared to the hydrogen

atom is the singularity at the event horizon in addition to the singularity at the origin.

However, using a series expansion it turns out that a solution an be found whih is

regular at the horizon. Further it an be shown that a ertain boundary ondition has

to be ful(cid:28)lled there. Although the probability density of the partile does not vanish

within the event horizon we will omit this area. With the help of the above mentioned

series expansion and boundary ondition around the horizon we will get an initial value

in(cid:28)nitesimal lose to the event horizon from where a numerial integration proedure

an be started. To start this integration proedure not diretly at the event horizon

is neessary beause of the possibility to get to a solution whih is not regular there.

As in ase of ordinary quantum mehanis the solution has to approah zero at in(cid:28)nity

to represent a regular bound state that is normalizable. With this ondition we an

(cid:28)nd the eigenstates by varying the energy as long as the wave funtion does vanish at

in(cid:28)nity. The stationary states have omplex energy eigenvalues as we are dealing with

a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. The omplexity of the energy eigenvalues is onneted

to the instability of the states and with the help of the imaginary part of the energy

it is possible to determine the deay times. However, an exat predition of the deay

times exeeds the sope of this artile. A disussion of this topi an be found in ref.

[1℄. The topi of the summer pro jet as presented here is based on refs.

[1, 2, 3℄ and

therefore owes many ideas to these papers where the present problems have been treated

for the (cid:28)rst time. A similar situation onerning the Klein-Gordon equation has been

onsidered in ref. [4℄.

2. Implementation of general relativity into the Dira equation

Sine we are going to study a fermion in a gravitational (cid:28)eld we have to onsider

the oupling of the Dira equation to gravity. Aording to the other fundamental

interations ourring in nature gravity an also be formulated as a gauge theory. (For

an introdution to the idea of gauge theories in general we suggest ref. [5℄(Chapter 15).)

The di(cid:27)erene is that not loal invariane under internal symmetri transformations is

demanded but loal invariane under Lorentz transformations is onsidered.

2.1. Notation

The following symbols will be used:

ψ ˆ= Dira Spinor (in oordinate representation).

|Ψi ˆ= vetor in Hilbert spae desribing an arbitrary quantum state and hΨ| ˆ= the

orresponding dual vetor (refraining from any speial representation).

transformation.

µ ˆ= Lorentz transformation matries and (Λ−1)ν

µ ˆ= the orresponding inverse

U ˆ= arbitrary unitary operator and U † ˆ= its hermitean onjugated operator.
x[ab] = xab − xba

Besides we will make the arrangement that Greek indies refer to arbitrary global

oordinates and Latin indies refer to the loal oordinate system in whih the metri

tensor gµν takes the form of the speial metri tensor of (cid:29)at Minkowski spae time ηmn .

If a ertain index adopts a spei(cid:28) value the speial loal oordinates are denoted with

a bar to distinguish them from arbitrary global oordinates. As usual natural units will

be used whih means that ¯h = c = G = 1.

2.2. The general shape of the equation

Like in ase of usual gauge theories one starts with the Lagrangian of the free (cid:28)eld

equation, in our ase the Dira equation ((cid:28)rst published in ref. [6℄)

L = ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ − m)ψ.

In the framework of relativisti quantum mehanis a Lorentz transformation is

transformations are provided by the generators of the group. The generators of the

Lorentz group obey the following Lie Algebra

[Σαβ, Σγδ]− = ηγβΣαδ − ηγαΣβδ + ηδβΣδα − ηδαΣγβ.

If we want to analyse the ation of Lorentz transformations on quantum mehanial

states of fermions desribed by the Dira equation we have to onsider the Dira Spinors

representation. In this representation the generators are given by

Σµν =

[γµ, γν]−.

(For an extensive treatment of the theory of group representations in the ontext of

physis inluding a derivation of Eq. (2) and the Dira Spinor representation of the

Lorentz group we suggest ref. [7℄(setions 2.2-2.4 and setion 5.4, resp.).)

It is a priori lear that the Dira equation is invariant under arbitrary global Lorentz

transformations, i.e. independent of the spae time point beause it was derived from

this onstraint. (An expliit proof of this invariane property an be found in ref. [8℄.)

In ontrast to this, the well known Dira Lagrangian is not invariant under loal Lorentz

transformations, but these are exatly the ones needed in the ase of general relativity.

In general relativity (cid:29)at Minkowski spae time is replaed by a urved spae time (this

topi is originally presented in ref. [9℄). This means that at every point of spae time the

metri tensor gµν

looks di(cid:27)erent. If one wants to ompare two mathematial ob jets at

di(cid:27)erent spae time points, one (cid:28)rst has to transform to the frame in whih the metri

tensor looks like the metri tensor ηµν

of (cid:29)at Minkowski spae time. Thus a spei(cid:28)

Lorentz transformation at eah spae time point has to be performed. This is the reason

why we have to onsider loal Lorentz transformations within the framework of general

relativity. Thus, it is our next task to formulate the Dira equation in a way that obeys

loal symmetry transformations

ψ → U(x)ψ ,

∂µ → Λν

(6)

It is lear that suh a ovariant derivative obeys loal Lorentz invariane, beause the

U operators to the left and right of the derivative operator anel the operators whih

at on the right and on the left state in the Lagrangian.

The ovariant derivative Dµ applied to the metri tensor is zero. This means that
Dµ is the derivative onneting di(cid:27)erent spae time points endowed with a loal pseudo-
Eulidean oordinate system in whih gµν = ηµν . Sine we are regarding Spinors on the
spae time it is also neessary to onsider the ation of Dµ on the Dira Spinor spae.

Now we have to (cid:28)nd out how this ovariant derivative looks like. To do this, we

assume that Dµ is of the following shape

Dm = eµ
Here we have introdued the vierbein eν

m(∂µ + iωµ).

global oordinates and the loal oordinates in whih the metri tensor looks like the

m desribing the transformation between arbitrary

metri tensor of (cid:29)at Minkowski spae time. This means that the following relation is

valid

ηmn = eµ

meν

ngµν,

whih an be seen as the de(cid:28)nition of the vierbein.

It expresses that if we know

the vierbein at eah spae time point we an obtain the metri (cid:28)eld meaning that

it ontains the same information about the struture of spae time. So the vierbein

represents another way to desribe the gravitational (cid:28)eld and an replae the metri

tensor. Further, the vierbein ful(cid:28)ls the relations

µ eµ
em

n = δm
n

,

mem
eµ

ν = δµ
ν .

(An extensive introdution to the vierbein-formalism an be found in ref. [10℄).

By inserting Eq. (7) into the above transformation ondition Eq. (6) and rewriting

it a little bit one gets

eµ
m(∂µ + iωµ) → Λn
So the ovariant derivative eµ

2.3. Calulation of the Spinor oe(cid:30)ients

Now we have to determine the spei(cid:28) form of the Spinor onnetion oe(cid:30)ients ωmn
µ .
It is important to notie that our oe(cid:30)ients ωmn
ontain one index (µ) referring to
the global oordinate system and two indies (m, n) referring to the loal oordinate
system where gmn = ηmn . First, we express the above oe(cid:30)ients ωmn
Christo(cid:27)el symbols Γρ

µν de(cid:28)ning the parallel transport between vetors in the tangential

µ

µ

by the usual

vetor spae of di(cid:27)erent spae time points. They are de(cid:28)ned by the ondition that the

metri shall be left invariant by the ovariant derivative

Dµ(gρσ) = 0

and have the following shape

Γρ

µν =

gρσ(∂νgµσ + ∂µgνσ − ∂σgµν).

1
2

(The expliit derivation of this relation an be found in any book on general

relativity, e.g. [11℄.)

We an express the ovariant derivative of the vierbein by applying the Christo(cid:27)el

symbol to eah index leading to

Dµem

ν = ∂µem

ν + Γm

µnen

ν − Γρ

µνem
ρ .

Inserting Eq. (8) into Eq. (16) and onsidering the ase ν = ρ one obtains

Dµ(gνν) = Dµ(em

ν en

ν ηmn) = Dµ((em
ν )2 = 2ηmmem

ν )2ηmm)
ν Dµem

ν = 0.

= ηmmDµ(em

whih means that the ovariant derivative applied to the vierbein gives zero

Here we have used that Dµηmn = 0 and ηmn is a diagonal matrix. Combining Eq. (18)
and (20) results in

Dµem

ν = 0.

∂µem

ν + Γm

µnen

ν − Γρ

µνem

ρ = 0.

By moving the seond term of Eq. (21) to the r.h.s. side of the equation, multiplying
with eν

n and raising the (cid:29)at oordinate indies with ηαβ

we arrive at a relation between

the above Dira Spinor oe(cid:30)ients and the Christo(cid:27)el symbols in arbitrary oordinates.

µ = Γmn
ωmn

µ = −ηnpeν

p(∂µem

ν − Γρ

µνem

ρ ).

Here, we an identify the oe(cid:30)ients of the onnetion ωmn

µ with the Christo(cid:27)el

symbols expressed in terms of the loal oordinates, beause the onnetion between the

tangential vetor spaes of di(cid:27)erent points on the spae time manifold is independent

of the speial spae by whih it is represented. If one realls now that the vierbein eµ
m

desribes the transformation between global and loal oordinates, one an express the

8

oe(cid:30)ients by the vierbein. Using Eq. (8) in Eq. (17), inserting it to Eq. (22) and

transforming the obtained expression a little bit, we arrive at

µ = 2eν[m∂[µen]
ωmn

ν] + eµpeνmeσn∂[σep
ν].

(23)

So we have expressed the onnetion oe(cid:30)ients in terms of the vierbein. (The derivation

of this formula an also be found in [13℄. For advaned aspets onerning the relation

between the usual formulation of general relativity and the vierbein formalism we suggest

Refs. [10℄,[12℄ and [13℄.)

3. Solution of the Dira equation in a Shwarzshild bakground

3.1. The hoie of a suitable formulation of the Dira equation in a Shwarzshild

bakground

So far we have formulated the Dira equation in a general spae time with an arbitrary

metri tensor and an arbitrary onnetion between di(cid:27)erent spae time points. To be

spei(cid:28) we will from now on fous on the speial ase of the Shwarzshild metri,

beause we are investigating a partile in a spherially symmetri gravitational (cid:28)eld.

The Shwarzshild metri ((cid:28)rst presented in [14℄) is usually represented in the

following way

gµν =



A spherially symmetri ob jet only in(cid:29)uenes the radial part of the metri. Therefore,

we have to deal with the time and the radial part of the metri and do not onsider the

angular oordinate. This leads to

µγµ = e0
e0
µγµ = er
er

¯0γ¯0 + e0
¯0γ¯0 + er

¯rγ ¯r,
¯rγ ¯r.

The omponents of the Shwarzshild metri are not fully determined due to the fat

that the metri an be expressed as a funtion of a new time oordinate aording to

It is important to note that this transformation of the time oordinate indeed hanges

the appearane of the metri, but does not a(cid:27)et the g00 -omponent of the metri. This

omponent is equal in all representations

Besides this, the vierbein is still under-determined if a speial time oordinate is hosen

beause of the possibility to apply a radial dependant Lorentz boost to the system

onneted to the hoie of a global gauge.

This means that two degrees of freedom remain. However, two onstraints an be

It is very important to emphasise that all hoies of the vierbein ful(cid:28)lling

the onstraints (29) represent

the usual Shwarzshild metri but in di(cid:27)erent

representations. It turns out that the Dira equation in a Shwarzshild bakground

By the speial hoie of the vierbein in Eq.

ompletely determined by Eq. (15) and Eq. (28). To (cid:28)nd the spei(cid:28) Dira equation
we have to speify the onnetion oe(cid:30)ients ωmn
µ by inserting the above hoie of the
vierbein to Eq. (23). In the expression arising from this most terms vanish and one

The oe(cid:30)ients with equal upper indies vanish beause of the antisymmetry. By

3.2. Reformulation to a system of di(cid:27)erential equations

In the previous setion we have derived the Dira equation on a Shwarzshild

bakground in a suitable representation. It has the form of the free Dira equation with

an additive radial dependant perturbation term. Now the task remains to reformulate

the free part of the equation and to express it in spherial oordinates and then to

separate the radial part of the state from the spherial symmetri one.

First we rewrite Eq. (34) by expressing the γ -matries by the well-known α- and
β -matries whih are de(cid:28)ned by the relations γ0 = β and γk = βαk for k = 1, 2, 3 and

obtain

(iβ∂t + iβαk∂k − m − iβ

(∂r +

))ψ = 0.

Rearranging this equation and multiplying it with β we get

Sine we are (cid:28)nally interested in stable orbits (the energy eigenstates) we separate the

time to get the time independent Dira equation.

Choosing the following ansatz

ψ = e−iEtΨ,

leads to

These are the di(cid:27)erential equations for a Dira partile in a Shwarzshild metri

3.3. Solution of the time independent equation with suitable boundary onditions

After deriving the system of di(cid:27)erential equations the (cid:28)nal task is to alulate the energy

eigenstates by solving the set of oupled partial di(cid:27)erential equations. Beause the set of

equations ontains omplex numbers it is onvenient to split the two radial omponents

Φ and χ in a real and imaginary omponent resulting in four equations whih an be

integrated numerially.

However, before we do this, we have to make sure that there exists a regular solution

at the event horizon and to determine the neessary boundary onditions. Therefore

we will transpose the above equation system. In both Eqs. (43) appear the derivatives
of Φ and χ. By solving one equation for ∂rΦ and the other for ∂rχ and inserting eah

equation into the other we get the following system

After this transformation the singularity at the event horizon (rs = 2M) shows up

expliitly. Nevertheless it is possible to (cid:28)nd a regular solution. To obtain this solution

we perform a series expansion around the event horizon

To begin an integration of the di(cid:27)erential equation system Eq. (44) one needs the start
values of Φ and χ. By using the series expansion Eq. (45) we have found one onstraint
for the start values of the integration of φ and χ. The remaining degree of freedom is

only onneted to the the overall normalisation of the wave funtion. It is determined

by the normalisation ondition that the integral over the squared norm has to be equal

to unity beause of the probability interpretation of the wave funtion. So the wave is

de(cid:28)ned apart from a physially irrelevant overall phase.

The integration annot be started diretly from the horizon beause of the problem

with the non-regular solutions. However, if we onsider our series expansion Eq. (45)

to the (cid:28)rst order in(cid:28)nitesimal adjaent to the event horizon we an (cid:28)nd the oe(cid:30)ients

a1 and b1 by inserting it to the equation system (44) and solving it. Beause of the
omplexity of a1 and b1 we have e(cid:27)etively four equations. The alulation is quite long

but mathematially trivial. We will therefore refrain from presenting it here.

The oe(cid:30)ients a1 and b1 of the (cid:28)rst order series expansion Eq.

(45) together
with the start values of φ and χ de(cid:28)ne the wave funtion in(cid:28)nitesimally lose to the

horizon from where the numerial integration an be started. The energy eigenvalues

are found by the ondition that the wave funtion has to approah zero at in(cid:28)nity to

assure integrability.

3.4. Non-hermitiity of the Hamiltonian

Unfortunately, we annot be sure that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (39)
H = HDirac +HInt are real. In general real eigenvalues are only obtained from hermitean

operators. In the ase disussed here, we will show that the Hamiltonian is not hermitian.

The Hamiltonian is the generator of the group desribing the way quantum mehanial

states in Hilbert spae evolve with time. This means that

U(t2, t1) = exp [−iH(t2 − t1)] ,

where U(t2, t1) desribes the relation between a quantum mehanial state |ψ(t1)i at
time t1 and the same state |ψ(t2)i at time t2 within the Shrödinger piture, i.e.

|ψ(t2)i = U(t2, t1)|ψ(t1)i.

If the time evolution operator U(t1, t2) is unitary this results in a onstant overall
probability. But Eq. (49) tells us that this is only the ase beause of the hermitiity

of the Hamiltonian. In the ase of a non-hermitean Hamiltonian unitary breaks down

and the norm of the state an hange.

In our ase this is due to the fat that the

singularity at the entre of the blak hole leads to an instability of the states resulting

in a probability urrent through the event horizon. Before drawing our attention to

this phenomenon again we will (cid:28)rst show this non-hermitiity of the Hamiltonian of Eq.

(39).

Hermitiity implies that the expetation value of an operator is real

In oordinate representation the inner produt of Dira Spinors is de(cid:28)ned as

hΨ|H|Ψi = hΨ|H|Ψi∗.

So we have H † 6= H and the energy eigenvalues need not to be real and so we have to

extend our searh to omplex numbers.

However if we have found the eigenstate we are mainly interested in the real part

in the ontext of this artile. The real part of the energy has to be smaller than the rest

energy of the partile to provide a (if we abstain from instability) stationary state. It

turns out that the imaginary part is always negative. Therefore we de(cid:28)ne

E = ER − iEIm,

with EIm > 0. As already mentioned in the introdution the imaginary part is onneted

to the instability of the states. This instability orresponds the analogue fat in the

framework of partile mehanis that a partile whih has passed the horizon annot

get bak to the area outside the horizon and disappears in the singularity at the entre

of the blak hole. In the ase of quantum mehanis this means there is an e(cid:27)etive

inward urrent. By realling now Eqs. (49) and (50) and using the eigenvalue equation

we obtain

|ψ(t2)i = exp [−iE(t2 − t1)] |ψ(t1)i.

(58)

With the help of Eq. (57) we an transform Eq. (58) to

|ψ(t2)i = {exp [−iER(t2 − t1)] |ψ(t1)i} exp [−EIm(t2 − t1)] .

So it an be seen diretly that a negative imaginary energy part results in an exponential

derease of the probability density. This is only another way to express the fat that

probability density vanishes with time. Suh a phenomena an only be interpreted as

the e(cid:27)et of a urrent sink at the singularity of the entre. If probability density extends

to the area within the horizon it annot esape and has to end at the singularity in the

entre. Without this speial struture of spae time onneted to blak holes suh a

strange phenomena ould not take plae. This means that the deay rate of the states

depends on the properties of the wave funtion near the origin. A small probability

density near the singularity leads to a long deay time. Thus states with a large

angular momentum, i.e. a small probability density near the origin are very stable.

This shows up expliitly in the dereasing imaginary part of the energy as a funtion of

the displaement of the probability density outwards (see Figures). For a more extensive

disussion of this deay phenomenon the reader an onsult ref. [1℄.

the solutions of the orresponding equation with a oupled Coulomb-potential desribing

a hydrogen atom. The main di(cid:27)erene is the non-stability of the states onneted to

the non-Hermitiity of the Hamiltonian.

In the gravitational (cid:28)eld real bound states

exist only in an approximative sense and if the angular momentum beomes large the

main part of the probability density lies far away from the origin. Using the Newtonian

gravitational potential would orrespond exatly to the hydrogen atom with other pre-

fators. Thus the deviations in ase of gravity arise from the desription obtained by

onsidering general relativity.

The other omparison onerns the relation to the orbits of lassial partiles. In ase

of lassial mehanis on a Shwarzshild bakground there are two di(cid:27)erent kinds of

states or orbits orresponding to the obtained quantum mehanial states. On the one

hand there are orbits with high angular momentum preserving partiles from falling into

the blak hole. On the other hand there are possible orbits making the partile rossing

the horizon. If suh a rossing of the horizon takes plae the partile an never reah the

area outside again and falls to the entre of the blak hole. The orbits or states of the

(cid:28)rst ategory are stable in an absolute sense. This is di(cid:27)erent in the ase of quantum

mehanis where no suh disrete lassi(cid:28)ation an be made leading to the fat that all

states have an imaginary part whih never vanishes.

Qualitatively, we might also obtain similar results with the Klein-Gordon equation

sine the speial properties of the onsidered situation, e.g.

the instability of the

states, are independent of spei(cid:28) aspets of di(cid:27)erent partiles. However, one does

not expet to get the same energy levels beause of the speial aspets related to the

inner degree of freedom of Fermions leading to an additional Spinor ontribution to

the Hamiltonian. The additional Spinor onnetion term gives the reason why the

energy eigenvalues for Dira partiles are di(cid:27)erent from those of Klein-Gordon partiles.

Besides, the desription of fermions on urved spae time is only possible by introduing

the mathematial onept of the vierbein. In spite of the more di(cid:30)ult solution it is

more interesting to onsider the Dira equation beause most fundamental partiles are

fermions and thus obey the Dira equation.

To obtain onrete Figures and energy eigenvalues we have hosen the speial ase of

an eletron having a rest mass of me = 9.109 · 10−31kg in the gravitational (cid:28)eld of a
blak hole with mass M = 1.825 · 1014kg. To speify a partile with a ertain rest

mass is important sine the onrete eigenvalue of the energy depends on it aording

to the relativisti relation between energy and momentum. This setting is similar to an

eletron in the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld of a proton, hene a hydrogen atom. The mass of

the blak hole hosen here orresponds to a Shwarzshildradius of rs = 2.7 · 10−13m.
For the lowest state of J = 1/2 (see Figure 1) i.e. without orbital angular momentum
and the lowest states for J = 3/2 and J = 5/2 (see Figures 2 and 3) |Φ|2 + |χ|2
as a funtion of r/rs . One an see that inreasing orbital angular momentum leads to

is plotted

a distint movement of the probability density outwards. In Figure 1 the probability

density at the horizon is still more than 50 % of the peak probability density. In the

ase with orbital angular momentum of 1 one observes that the ontribution near the

horizon nearly vanishes.

5. Aknowledgements

Primarily we want to thank H. Stöker for stimulating this very interesting pro jet as

a part of his leture on Quantum Mehanis II. Without his idea to deal with suh a

topi in the ontext of a student summer pro jet this artile would not exist. Further

we are grateful for inspiring and helpful disussions with A. Lasenby and S. Dolan from

whose work we pro(cid:28)ted a lot.

Abstract. Cosmology is an attracting subject for students but usually diﬃcult to
deal with if general relativity is not known. In this article, we ﬁrst recall the Newtonian
derivation of the Friedmann equations which govern the dynamics of our universe and
discuss the validity of such a derivation. We then study the equations of evolution of
the universe in terms of a dynamical system. This sums up the diﬀerent behaviors of
our universe and enables to address some cosmological problems.

In this article, we want to present a pedagogical approach to the equations governing the
evolution of the universe, namely the Friedmann equations. Indeed, the derivation of
this equations is intrinsically relativistic. Although in Newtonian theory, the universe
must be static, Milne [1] and McCrea and Milne [2] showed that, surprisingly, the
Friedmann equations can be derived from the simpler Newtonian theory. In section 2,
we recall their derivation (
2.1) for a universe ﬁlled with pressureless matter and then

2.2). Indeed, it is puzzling that

Once we have interpreted the Friedmann equations, we study them as a dynamical
system. The ﬁrst authors to consider such an approach were Stabell and Refsdal [3]
who investigated the Friedmann–Lemaˆıtre model with a pressureless ﬂuid. This was
then generalised to a ﬂuid with any equation of state [4, 5]. Then, this technique
was intensively used to study the isotropisation of homogeneous models (see e.g.
[6]
and references therein). For a general description of the use of dynamical systems in
cosmology, we refer to the book by Wainwright and Ellis [7] where most of the techniques
are detailed. Our purpose here, is to present such an analysis for a ﬂuid with any
equation of state and including a cosmological constant while staying as pedagogical

by a numerical integration of this set of equations (

the initial conditions explaining the current observed state of our universe (
§

5).

2. A Newtonian derivation of the Friedmann equation

We follow the approach by Milne [1] and McCrea and Milne [2] and the reader is referred
to [8] for further details.

2.1. General derivation

We consider a sphere of radius R ﬁlled with a pressureless ﬂuid (P = 0) of uniform
(mass) density ρ free–falling under its own gravitational ﬁeld in an otherwise empty
Euclidean space. We decompose the coordinate x of any particle of the ﬂuid as

where r is a constant vector referred to as the comoving coordinate, t is the time
coordinate and a the scale factor. We choose a to have the dimension of a length
and r to be dimensionless. It implies that the sphere undergoes a self similar expansion
or contraction and that no particle can cross another one. Indeed the edge of the sphere
is also moving as

x = a(t)r

R(t) = a(t)R0.

ri) = Hxij

Assume that while sitting on a particle labelled i we are observing a particle labelled j;
we see it drift with the relative velocity
vij = ˙a (rj −
ri). As a consequence,
where a dot refers to a time derivative, H
≡
any particle i sees any other particle j with a radial velocity proportional to its distance
and the expansion is isotropic with respect to any point of the sphere, whatever the
function a(t). But, note that this does not imply that all particles are equivalent (as
will be discussed later).

˙a/a and xij ≡

To determine the equation of motion of any particle of this expanding sphere, we
ﬁrst write the equation of matter conservation stating that the mass within any comoving
volume is constant (i.e. ρx3

r3) implying that

A Dynamical Study of the Friedmann Equations

To determine the equation of evolution of the scale factor a, we ﬁrst compute the

gravitational potential energy EG of a particle of masse m by applying the Gauss law

where G is the Newton constant and M(< x) the mass within the sphere of radius x
given by

We then need to evaluate its kinetic energy EK which takes the simple form

The conservation of the total energy E = EG + EK implies, after the use of the
decomposition (1) and a simpliﬁcation by r, that

2.2. Introducing a cosmological constant

In the former derivation, the gravitational potential on any particle inside the sphere is
proportional to the distance x2. Any other force deriving from a potential proportional
to x2 will mimic a gravitational eﬀect. A force deriving from the potential energy EΛ
deﬁned by

where Λ is a constant was introduced by Einstein in 1917. As in the previous section,
writing that the total energy E = EK + EG + EΛ is constant leads to the equation of
motion

From (10), we deduce that Λ has the dimension of an inverse squared length. The total
force on a particle is

from which it can be concluded that (i) it opposes gravity if Λ is positive and that (ii)
it can be tuned so that F = 0 leading to ˙a = 0 and ρ =constant if

This scaling of K with r is imposed by the requirement that the expansion is self–similar (Eq. 1) and

‡
that no shell of labeled r can cross a shell of label r′ > r.

This enables to recover a static autogravitating sphere hence leading to a model for a
static universe. The force deriving from EΛ is analogous to the one exerted by a spring
of negative constant.

To ﬁnish, we recall on table 1 the dimension of all the quantities used in the former
sections, mainly to compare with standard textbooks in which the choice c = 1 is usually
made.

2.3. Discussion

From this Newtonian approach, the equation of evolution of the universe identiﬁed
with this gravitating sphere are thus given by equation (5) and (11). These are two
diﬀerential equations for the two variables a(t) and ρ(t) which can be solved once the
two parameters K and Λ have been chosen.

In the context of general relativity, one can deduce the law of evolution for the scale

factor of the universe a which is given by the Friedmann equations

Eq. (14) reduces to (11) and, Eq. (16) to (5) when P = 0. The equation (15) is
redundant and can be deduced from the two others. Note that now Eq. (16) is also a
conservation equation but with the mass ﬂux j = (ρ + P/c2)v. This can be interpreted
by remembering that the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for an adiabatic system [9] takes
the form

˙E + P ˙V = 0

where E = ρV c2 is the energy contained in the physical volume V (scaling as a3).

The ﬁrst thing to stress is that equations (5) and (11) do not depend on the radius
R0 of the sphere. It thus seems that we can let it go to inﬁnity without changing the
conclusions and hence explaining why we recover the Friedmann equations. This was
the viewpoint adopted by Milne [1] and McCrea and Milne [2]. This approach leads to
some problems. First, it has to be checked that the Gauss theorem still applies after
taking the limit toward inﬁnity (i.e. one has to check that the integrals and the limit

(14)

(15)

(17)

commute). This imposes that ρ decreases fast enough with r and thus that there is
indeed a center. Equivalently, as pointed out by Layzer [10], the force on any particle
of an inﬁnite homogeneous distribution is undetermined (the integral over the angles
is zero while the integral over the radial coordinate is inﬁnite). The convergence of
the force requires either the mass distribution to be ﬁnite (in which case it can be
homogeneous) or to be inhomogeneous if it is inﬁnite. The issue of the ﬁniteness of the
universe has been widely discussed and a clear presentation of the evolution of ideas in
that respect are presented in [16]. Second, for distances of cosmological interests, i.e. of
some hundred of Megaparsec, the recession speed of the particles of the sphere are of
order of some fraction of the speed of light. One will thus require a (special) relativistic
treatment of the expanding sphere. Third, the gravitational potential grows with the
square of the radius of the sphere but it can not become too large otherwise, due to the
virial theorem, the velocities would exceed the speed of light.

It was then proposed [12] that such an expanding sphere may describe a region
the size of which is small compared with the size of the observable universe (i.e. of the
Hubble size). Since all regions of a uniform and isotropic universe expand the same way,
the study of a small region gives information about the whole universe (but this does
not solve the problem of the computation of the gravitational force).

The center seems to be a privileged points since it is the only point to be at rest
with respect to the absolute frame. But, one can show that the spacetime background of
Newtonian mechanics is invariant under a larger group than the traditionally described
Galilean group. As shown by Milne [1], McCrea and Milne [2] and Bonnor [13] (see also
Carter and Gaﬀet [14] for a modern description) it includes the set of all time-dependent
space translations

xi

xi + zi(t)

→

where zi(t) are arbitrarily diﬀerentiable functions depending only on the time coordinate
t. This group of transformation is intermediate between the Galilean group and the
group of all diﬀeomorphisms under which the Einstein theory in invariant. Thanks to
this invariance group, each point can be chosen as a center around which there is local
isotropy and homogeneity but the isotropy is broken by the existence of the boundary
of the sphere (i.e. all observer can believe living at the center as long as he/she does
not observe the boundary of the expanding sphere).

There are also conceptual diﬀerences between the Newtonian cosmology and the
relativist cosmology. In the former we have a sphere of particle moving in a static and
absolute Euclidean space and the time of evolution of the sphere is disconnected from
the absolute time t. For instance in a recollapsing sphere, the time will go on ﬂowing
even after the crunch of the sphere. In general relativity, space is expanding and the
particles are comoving. We thus identify an expanding sphere in a ﬁxed background
and an expanding spacetime with ﬁxed particles. As long as we are dealing with a
pressureless ﬂuid, this is possible since there is no pressure gradient and each point of
the sphere can be identify with one point of space (in fact, with an absolute time we are
working in a synchronous reference frame and we want it to be also comoving, which is

possible only if P = 0 [15]). Moreover, the pressure term in the Friedmann equations
cannot trivially be recovered from the Newtonian argument. As shown, one gets the
correct Friedmann equations if one starts from the conservation law including pressure
(and derived from the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics) and the conservation of energy. But
if one were starting from the Newton law relating force (12) and acceleration (m¨ax), the
term containing the pressure in (15) would not have been recovered; one should have
4πGmP x/c2 which can not be guessed.
added an extra pressure contribution FP =
This is a consequence that in general relativity any type of energy has a gravitational
eﬀect. In a way it is a “miracle” that the equation (14) does not depend on P , which
makes it possible to derive from the Newtonian conservation of energy. Beside it has also
to be stressed that the Newtonian derivation of the Friedmann equations by Milne came
after Friedmann and Lemaˆıtre demonstrated the validity of the Friedmann equations
for an unbounded homogeneous distribution of matter (using general relativity). It has
to be pointed out that these Newtonian models can not explain all the observational
relations since, contrary to general relativity, they do not incorporate a theory of light
propagation. As outlined by Lazer [10] one can sometime legitimately treat a part
of the (dust) expanding universe as an isolated system in which case the Newtonian
treatment is correct, which makes McCrea [11] conclude that this is an indication that
Einstein’s law of gravity must admit the same interpretation as that of Newton’s in the
case of a spherically symmetric mass distribution. Note that the structural similarity of
Einstein and Newton gravity were put forward by Cartan [17] who showed that these
two theories are much closer that one naively thought and, in that framework (which
goes far beyond our purpose) one can work out a correct derivation of the Friedmann
equations (see e.g. [18]).

The most important outcome of the Newtonian derivation of the Friedmann
equations is that it allows to interpret equation (14) in terms of the conservation of
energy; the term in H 2 represents the kinetic energy, the term in κρ/3 the gravitational
potential energy, the term in Λ/3 the energy associated with the cosmological constant
and the term in K the total energy of the system. The properties of the spatial sections
(i.e. of the three dimensional spaces of constant time) are related to the sign of K and
can be compared with the property of the trajectories of the point of the sphere which
are related to the sign of the total energy E; we sum up all these properties on table 2.

3. The Friedmann equations as a dynamical system

The Friedmann equations (14–15) and the conservation equation (16) form a set of two
independent equations for three variables (a, P and ρ). The usual approach is to solve
this system by specifying the matter content of the universe mainly by assuming an
equation of state of the form

P = (γ

1)ρc2

−

where γ may depend on ρ and thus on time. For a pressureless ﬂuid (modelling
for instance a ﬂuid of galaxies) γ = 1 and for a ﬂuid of radiation (such as photon,
neutrino,...) γ = 4/3. We assume that γ
= 0 since such a type of matter is described
by the cosmological constant and singled out from “ordinary” matter and that γ
= 2/3
since such a type of matter mimics the curvature term and is thus incorporated with it.
3da/a to get the function

One can then ﬁrst integrate (16) rewritten as dρ/(γρ) =

ρ(a) which, in the case where γ is constant, yields

−

ρ(a) = Ca−3γ

where C is a positive constant of integration, and then insert the solution for ρ(a) in
Eq. (14) to get a closed equation for the scale factor a (see e.g. [19] for such an approach
and [20] for an alternative and pedagogical derivation).

In this section, we want to present another approach in which the Friedmann

equations are considered as a dynamical system and to determine its phase space.

3.1. Derivation of the system

Ω

The ﬁrst step is to rewrite the set of dynamical equations with the three new variables
Ω, ΩΛ and ΩK deﬁned as

Λc2

(21)

They respectively represent the relative amount of energy density present in the matter
distribution, cosmological constant and curvature. Ω has to be positive and there is no
constraint on the sign of both ΩΛ and ΩK. With these deﬁnitions, it is straightforward
to deduce from (14) that

H 2, expressing ¨a/a from Eq. (15) and H 2 from Eq. (14), we

It is useful to rewrite the full set of equations by introducing the new dimensionless time
variable η
ln(a/a0), a0 being for instance the value of a today. The derivative of any
quantity X with respect to η, X ′, is then related to its derivative with respect to t by
X ′ = ˙X/H. The equation of evolution of the Hubble parameter (24) takes the form

≡

Now, diﬀerentiating Ω, ΩΛ and ΩK with respect to η, using Eq. (26) to express H ′,
a′ = a and Eq. (16) to express ρ′ =

and it is trivial to check that Ω′ + Ω′

K = 0 as expected form (23).

Indeed, it is useless to study the full system (26–29) (i) since H does not enter the
set of equations (27–29) and is solely determined by Eq. (26) once this system has been
solved and (ii) since Ω can be deduced algebraically from (23). As a consequence, we
retain the closed system

with q being a function of ΩΛ and ΩK only and deﬁned in (25).

The system (30) is autonomous [21], which implies that there is a unique integral
curve passing through a given point, except where the tangent vector is not deﬁned
(ﬁxed points). Note that at every point on the curve the system (30) assigns a unique
tangent vector to the curve at that point. It immediately follows that two trajectories
cannot cross; otherwise the tangent vector at the crossing point would not be unique [21].

3.2. Determination of the ﬁxed points

To study the system (30) as a dynamical system, we ﬁrst need to determine the set of
ﬁxed points, i.e. the set of solutions such that Ω′
K = 0. These solutions
represent equilibrium positions which indeed can be either stable or unstable. The ﬁxed
points are thus solutions of

Λ = 0 and Ω′

It is an empty space ﬁlled with a positive cosmological constant and with ﬂat spatial
sections. We deduce from (23) and (25) that

This universe is accelerating in an eternal exponential expansion.

(iii) (ΩK, ΩΛ) = (1, 0): the Milne universe (M).

It is an empty space with no cosmological constant and with hyperbolic spatial
section (K < 0). We deduce from (23) and (25) that

Ω = 0,

q = 0

and integrating Eq. (14) gives

a(t) = a0t

for the solution vanishing at t = 0 and in units where K = a2
0.

It is also interesting to study the properties of the three following invariant lines

which separate the phase space in disconnected regions:

(i) ΩK = 0: The system (30) reduces to the equation of evolution for ΩΛ

Ω′

Λ = 3γ(1

Thus, if initially ΩK = 0, we stay on this line during the whole evolution and
converge toward either ΩΛ = 1 (i.e. the ﬁxed point dS) or toward ΩΛ = 0 (i.e. the
ﬁxed point EdS). It also follows that no integral ﬂow lines of the system (30) can
cross the line ΩK = 0. It separates the universes with ΩK > 0 which are compact
(i.e. having a ﬁnite spatial extension) and the universes with ΩK < 0 which are
inﬁnite (if one assumes trivial topology [23]). Crossing the line ΩK = 0 would thus
imply a change of topology. Note that if γ = 0, the ﬂuid behaves like a cosmological
constant and thus Ω′

Λ = 0 since ΩK remains zero.

the line ΩΛ = 0. Note that if γ = 2/3, the ﬂuid behaves like a curvature term and
thus Ω′

3.3. Stability analysis

The second step is to determine whether these ﬁxed points are stable (i.e. attractors:
A), unstable (i.e. repulsor: R) or saddle (S) points (i.e. attractor in a direction and
repulsor in another). This property can be obtained by studying at the evolution of a
small deviation from the equilibrium conﬁguration. We thus decompose ΩK and ΩΛ as

where (ΩΛ, ΩK) represents the coordinates of one of the ﬁxed points determined in the
previous section and where (ωΛ, ωK) is a small deviation around this point.

where FK and FΛ are two functions determined from (30), it can be expanded to linear
order around (ΩK, ΩΛ) (for which FK and FΛ vanish) to give the equation of evolution

(45)

The stability of a given ﬁxed point depends on the sign of the two eigenvalues (λ1,2) of the
matrix
P(ΩΛ,ΩK ). If both eigenvalues are positive (resp. negative) then the ﬁxed point is a
repulsor (resp. an attractor) since (ωK, ωΛ) will respectively goes to inﬁnity (resp. zero).
In the case where the two eigenvalues have diﬀerent signs, the ﬁxed point is an attractor
along the direction of the eigenvector associated with the negative eigenvalue and a
repulsor along the direction of the eigenvector associated with the positive eigenvalue.
We also introduce uλ1,2 the eigenvectors associated to the two eigenvalues which give
the (eigen)–directions of attraction or repulsion.

Before we sum up all theses results, let us concentrate about the cases where γ = 0
or γ = 2/3 in which the matter behaves respectively either as a cosmological constant
or as a curvature term. As a consequence Ω can be absorbed in a redeﬁnition of either
ΩΛ or ΩK and we can set Ω = 0 from which it follows that (23) implies ΩΛ + ΩK = 1.

As a conclusion of this study, we sum up the properties of the three spacetimes
as a function of the polytropic index of the cosmic ﬂuid in table 3 and in ﬁgure 1,
we depict the ﬁxed points, their directions of stability and instability as well as the
invariant boundary in the plane (ΩΛ, ΩK). Indeed, the attractor solution can be guessed
directly from Eq. (14) and the behavior (19) of the density with the scale factor since
if γ < 0 the matter energy density scales as a−3γ and comes to dominate over the
cosmological constant (scaling as a0) and the curvature (scaling as a−2). On the other
hand the cosmological constant always ﬁnishes by dominating if γ > 0. The curvature
can never dominates in the long run since it will be caught up by either the matter or
the cosmological constant.

4. Numerical examples

The full phase space picture can be obtained only through a numerical integration of
the system (30) by using an implicit fourth order Runge–Kutta method [22].

Ordinary matter such as a pressureless ﬂuid or a radiation ﬂuid has γ > 1 and we
ﬁrst consider this case on ﬁgure 2 where we depict the phase space both in the (ΩK, ΩΛ)

5. Discussion and conclusions

To discuss the naturalness of the initial conditions leading to our observed universe, we
have to add the actual observational measures in the plane (Ω, ΩΛ) and trace them back
to estimate the domain in which our universe has started. This required (i) to know
what are the constraints on the cosmological constant and the curvature of the universe
and (ii) determine the age of the universe, i.e. the time during which we must integrate
back.

It is not the purpose of this article to detail the observational methods used in
cosmology and a description can be found en e.g. [19]; we now just sum up what is
thought to be the current status of these observations. The current observational data
such as the cosmic microwave background measurements [24], the Type Ia supernovae
data [25], large scale velocity ﬁelds [26], gravitational lensing [27] and the measure of
the mass to light ratio [28] tend to show that

Ω0 ∼

0.3, ΩΛ0 ∼

0.7.

We refer the reader to the review by Bahcall et al. [29] for a combined study of these
data and a description of all the observation methods. Let us just keep in mind that we
are close to the line ΩK = 0 and let us consider the safe area of parameter such that

[0.1, 0.5], ΩΛ0 ∈
and let us determinate the initial conditions allowed by these observations.

[0.5, 0.9]

Ω0 ∈

D0 :

{

For that purpose, we need to integrate the system (30) back in time during a time
equal to the age of the universe. Today, the matter content of the universe is dominated
by a pressureless ﬂuid, the energy density of which is obtained once Ω0 has been chosen

the radiation is obtained by computing the energy contained in the cosmic microwave
background which is the dominant contribution to the radiation in the universe. Since it
is a black body with temperature Θ0 = 2.726 K, we deduce, from the Stephan-Boltzmann

domain

the beginning of the matter era and at the end Planck era.

To illustrate this ﬁne tuning problem analytically, let us just consider the simplest

case where ΩΛ = 0 for which the evolution of Ω is simply given by

the solution of which is

This illustrate that a almost ﬂat universe requires a ﬁne tuning of the curvature, which
is a consequence that ΩK = 0 is a repulsor in both the radiation and the matter era.

A solution to solve this ﬁne tuning problem would be to add a phase prior to the
radiation era in which γ
0 so that ΩK = 0 becomes an attractor and to tune the
duration of this era such as to have the correct initial conditions. Then, during the
standard evolution EdS becomes repulsor and we evolve toward dS staying close to the

a scenario. What inﬂation really does is to change the stability property of the ﬁxed
points and invariant boundaries of the system (30). Hence during this period where a
ﬂuid with negative pressure is dominating we are attracted close to the line ΩK = 0 and
the closer the longer this phase lasts. We then switch to a phase with normal matter and
start to drift away due to repulsive property of EdS. Nevertheless, inﬂation does more
than just explaining where we stand in this phase space, it also gives an explanation
for the observed structures (galaxies, clusters...) of our universe, but this is beyond the
scope of this article.

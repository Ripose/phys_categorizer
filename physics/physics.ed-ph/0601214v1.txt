ON THE HYDROGEN ATOM

Abstract

We present a brief historical introduction to the motivations behind quan-

tum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory on noncommutative spacetime and

provide an insightful technique, readily accessible to the undergraduate stu-

dent, to examine the measurable eﬀects of noncommutative spacetime on the

familiar hydrogen atom. Finally, we compare our results to those derived from

more sophisticated approaches.

1 Introduction

Noncommutativity is a fundamental concept underlying quantum physics. All con-

jugate variables fail to commute and indeed the uncertainty principle itself,

is based on the commutation relation of position and momentum,

(∆x)(∆p) ≥

¯h
2

[x, p] ≡ xp − px = i¯h.

Quantum ﬁeld theory on noncommutative spacetime is a modiﬁcation of quan-

tum ﬁeld theory based on the conjecture that spacetime coordinates at the Planck

scale do not commute. Traditionally, it is assumed that spacetime coordinates are

commutative,

[xµ, xν] = 0,

whereas noncommutative spacetime posits that the commutator of the spacetime

coordinates does not vanish. Many authors assume

[xµ, xν] = iθµν,

(4)

where θµν is a ﬁxed antisymmetric numerical matrix; while others assume that all

the commutators involving spacetime coordinates and momenta do not vanish. M.R.
Douglas and N.A. Nekrasov[1] and R.J. Szabo[2] give reviews of this subject.

W. Heisenberg ﬁrst proposed the use of noncommuting spacetime coordinates

to reconcile singularity problems connected with ultraviolet divergences in the early

days of quantum electrodynamics. The hope was that smearing out the spacetime

coordinates would remove the ultraviolet divergences of quantum ﬁeld theory associ-
ated with very short distances in spacetime. H. Snyder[3] formalized and published
the ﬁrst paper on the subject, but it was largely overlooked both because it did

not solve the divergence problem and because of the the contemporaneous success

of renormalization techniques. Our approach stems from an argument proposed by
S. Doplicher, et al:[4] a high momentum probe must be employed to measure the
position of a particle with great precision. Since momentum and energy are depen-

dent on the same quantities, the process would create a system with enough energy

to bring about gravitational collapse, forming a black hole. This creates a minimal

observable length, deforming the traditional uncertainty relation by adding an extra

term,

(∆x)(∆p) ≥

+ φ(∆p)2,

where ¯h is the reduced Planck’s constant, h/2π,

(6)

where λ is a dimensionless parameter whose importance will be revealed in the

following section and ao is the Bohr radius. We will use Eq. (5) to examine the

eﬀects of noncommutative spacetime on the hydrogen atom. More recently, string
theoretic considerations by N. Seiberg and E. Witten[5] revived interest the subject,
but their discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.

2 The Traditional Hydrogen Ground State

We begin by following an argument from The Feynman Lectures on Physics [6] em-
ploying the uncertainty principle to approximate the size of the hydrogen atom.

From a classical perspective, the attractive electromagnetic force between the pro-

ton and electron in a hydrogen atom would cause the electron to radiate all of its

energy in the form of light and come crashing down into the nucleus. In quantum

theory, this cannot happen because it would violate the uncertainty principle, as we

would be able to accurately determine both the position and momentum of the elec-

tron. Thus we can assume the electron will orbit the nucleus, having an uncertainty

in position (∆x). From the uncertainty principle, we can see that the uncertainty
in the electron’s momentum is (∆p) ≈ ¯h/(∆x). We can then ﬁnd the energy of the

electron by summing its kinetic and potential energies,

where m is the mass of the electron, π is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its

diameter, ǫo is the permittivity of free space and and e is the fundamental charge,
and use the uncertainty principle to replace (∆x),

.

We can set dE/d(∆p) = 0 to ﬁnd the minimum energy and ground state radius of

the hydrogen atom. This gives us

(∆p) = me2/(4πǫo)¯h

and

(∆x) = (4πǫo)¯h2/me2 ≡ ao = 0.529˚A,

which is the Bohr radius. Using these to solve for the ground state energy, we ﬁnd

which computes to -13.6eV, the measured ionization energy of the hydrogen atom.

3 The Perturbed Hydrogen Ground State

We can now use this approach with the deformed uncertainty relation to determine

the eﬀect of noncommutative spacetime on the hydrogen atom. We begin with the
modiﬁed commutation relation given by S. Benczik, et al,[7]

where β = φ/¯h , which leads to the modiﬁed uncertainty relation

To ﬁnd the minimum uncertainty we take

and substitute it into Eq. (7):

[x, p] = i¯h(1 + βp2),

(∆x)(∆p) ≈ ¯h + φ(∆p)2.

(∆x) ≈ (¯h + φ(∆p)2)/(∆p)

E =

(∆p)2
2m

−

1
4πǫo

e2(∆p)
¯h + φ(∆p)2 .

We can rearrange this equation algebraically to make it more manageable:

E =

¯h(∆p)2 + φ(∆p)4 − 2me2(∆p)/4πǫo
2m¯h + 2mφ(∆p)2

.

This makes it much easier to take dE/d(∆p) = 0 and solve for (∆p), as we can

divide out the denominator after taking the derivative using the quotient rule. Even

then, we are left with a quintic equation in (∆p),

0 = −

4m2¯he2 + 4m¯h2(∆p) +

4m2e2φ(∆p)2 + 8m¯hφ(∆p)3 + 4mφ2(∆p)5.

However, assuming φ is small, (an assumption that will be justiﬁed in the following

section) we can ﬁnd a solution with a ﬁrst order pertubation approximation. Solving

for the ﬁrst order pertubation, we obtain

(∆p) =

(1 − 3λ2)

and

Substituting these values into Eq. (7) gives us

(∆r) = ao(1 + 4λ2).

.

Here we see the importance of λ from Eq. (6). The terms of the equation’s right

hand side have the same variables, except that the second has λ which acts as a

dimensionless scaling variable. Since λ is squared, the second term is always positive

and thus non-commutative spacetime would increase the radius and ground state

energy of the hydrogen atom.

4 Agreement with Literature

We can compare our result to recent work by Benczik, et al and F. Brau,[8] who
solve the Schr¨odinger equation to calculate the perturbed hydrogen spectrum. Brau

gives an explicit formula for the perturbed hydrogen spectrum,

Enl = −

2n2 +

λ2a2

om3α4c4
5¯h2

(4n − 3(l + 1
n4(l + 1

2))

,

where α is the ﬁne structure constant, e2/(4πǫo)¯hc, c is the speed of light, n is
the principal quantum number, and l is the angular momentum quantum number.
Substituting e2/(4πǫo)¯hc for the ﬁne structure constant and ground state values
n = 1 and l = 0, Eq. (21) simpliﬁes to

E = −

1
4πǫo

e2
2ao

+

,

which is exactly the same as Eq. (20)! Moreover, Brau does an order of magnitude
calculation using the ﬁnite size of the electron to put an upper bound on λ ≤
2.83 × 10−7 validating our assumption that φ is small and pertubation theory could
be employed with accuracy. The most sophisticated mathematical tools in our

5

approach were a partial derivative and ﬁrst order pertubation approximation, both

of which can be learned by a typical undergraduate student, yet our results matched

very well those derived through much more rigorous means. We can see from our

calculations that noncommuting spacetime coordinates would increase the size of

the hydrogen atom very slightly and can expect that more accurate experimental

data will allow us to decrease the upper bound or observe a non-vanishing minimal

length.

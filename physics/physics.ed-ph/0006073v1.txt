Abstract

The expansions or the compressions of the ideal gas in the quasi-static
Carnot cycle, can be performed (on adiabatic or isothermal way) by slowly
increasing or decreasing the external pressure by means of small weights
acting on the piston of the vessel containing the gas. We call them shortly
the “driving weights” (dw). Let N be their number, a large one.

To determine the work performed by the ideal gas in the cycle the
“driving weights” must be handled carefully. If we let them move on-oﬀ
the piston only horizontally, their vertical motions will be due only to the
gas. Here we show that, at the end, while some of them will have moved
down (will have negative raising) the remaining ones (the majority) will
have moved up (will have positive raising) so that the total work performed
by the ideal gas equals the total variation of the gravitational potential
energy of the “driving weghts”.

The cycle is performed in 2N time-steps. For each step ti, i ∈
(1, .., 2N ), we give H(ti) and ∆H(ti−1, ti), respectively the height and
the raising of the piston. Moreover the overall raising of the individual
dw′s (i.e. hk, k ∈ (1...N ) ), and their distribution are given in simple,
general cases. The eﬃciency and the dissipated work are also evaluated.

This paper is aimed at imparting a deeper understanding of the ideal
Carnot Engine and may also be useful as a segment in a didactic path on
elementary calculus and statistics.

1 Introduction

To perform an ideal gas quasi-static-“reversible”[1]-Carnot-cycle, we need an heat
source, an heat sink, a vessel with a mobile piston and many small ”driving
weights” to increase or decrease slowly the external pressure (both for the
isothermal and adiabatic processes).[2]-[5]

To determine the work performed by the ideal gas in the cycle the “driving
weights” (dw) must be handled carefully. Therefore we let them move on-oﬀ the
piston only horizontally. To this end we assume that the handle of the piston be
endowed of so many consoles that we can move each dw horizontally from (or to)
the corresponding ﬁxed console as reported in Figure 1.

The piston is mobile, so when we increase the external pressure the last coming
dw (together with the previous ones) goes down. In the opposite case (expansion)
the chosen dw goes at rest on the console in front of it and the others go up.

“In this way you can ﬁnd out the work performed by the ideal gas in the
I
cycle: you will ﬁnd it in the increased potential energy of some of the dw′s”,
said in the last 25 years in the thermodynamic class at the University of Naples.
Sometimes in these years some clever student replayed: “I have thought a lot
about that and it seems to me that the dw′s go down”. My reply has been
always “You have to think more, because the work performed by the gas must
necessarily increase the potential Energy of the dw′s ”.[6]

Recently I decided to do a Java Applet [7] to show the raising of the dw′s
and, in writing down some elementary relations, I have found out that the clever
students were not totally wrong. In the following I report on a simple Carnot-
cycle done through the ideal device given in Figure 1 and show that, at the
end of the cycle, some of the dw′s will have moved down (will have negative
raising) while the remaining ones (the majority ) will have moved up (will have
positive raising) so that the total work performed by the ideal gas equals the
total variation of the gravitational potential energy of the “driving weights”. In
particular in Sec.2 is given an example of a Carnot-cycle done in 2N steps. In
the ﬁrst N steps the dw′s are added on the piston to perform ﬁrst an isothermal
compression and then an adiabatic compression. In the remaining N steps the
dw′s are removed from the piston in order to return to the initial state. The cycle
is reported in Figure 2. The height and the raising of the piston et each step i.e.
H(ti) and ∆H(ti−1, ti) = H(ti) − H(ti−1), are also calculated and reported in
Figure 3 and Figure 4

In Sec.3 we evaluate the raising of each dw at the end of the cycle. To ﬁnd
the raising of the dw which was put on the piston at one given time step, one
must know when it has been removed. The order in which the dw′s are removed
is quite arbitrary and actually there are N! ways in which the removing process

can be done. We analyze two main non-random removing processes: for both of
them the overall raising of the single dw is related to the sum of the raisings of the
piston for the time-steps in which the dw ‘lived’ on the piston and hence to the
diﬀerence of the height of the piston between the time at which it was removed
and at which it was added on the piston . The results are shown in Figure 6,
Figure 7 and Figure 8. In Figure 5 one can understand, directly from the P − V
representation of the cycle, why some dw′s have negative raising. In Sect. 4 the
relation which connects the raising of the single dw to the expansion of the gas is
obtained in an alternative way. The eﬃciency of the engine is evaluated in Sec.5
while the entropic gains are estimated in Appendix.

2 The cycle and the raising of the piston

One mole of ideal gas (e.g. dry air) is contained in the vessel shown in Figure 1,
and it is initially in thermal contact with the heat reservoir at T0 = 273.15 K.
The initial volume of the gas is V0 = 22.4 l. Let P0 = 1 atm = 101.3 KP a be
the external pressure on the piston and let the piston be massless so that at the
initial stage also the pressure of the gas is P0. For the dry air γ = Cp

Cv = 1.4.

The cycle we realize is reported in Figure 2.

It is done in 2N time-steps.
In the ﬁrst N steps the pressure P (ti), i ∈ (1..N) increases. At each step we
add on the piston a single dw. Let its mass be m = 0.1 Kg. Since the surface
of the piston is S = 100 cm2, this implies that at each step we are increasing
the pressure of a relatively small amount. The degree of irreversibility for this
step-wise process is evaluated in Appendix.

In the ﬁrst N steps we have

P (ti)
P0

=

z + i

z

where P (t0) ≡ P0 is the initial pressure, i is the number of dw′s on the piston
at step ti and z = 1033 is the number of grams whose weight on 1 cm2 give the
pressure of 1 atm. Therefore P (ti) = P0 + i∆P with ∆P = 1
1033 P0. In the
second N steps the dw′s are removed. As at each step a single dw is removed,
for P (tN +l), l ∈ (1...N) we have P (tN +l) = P0 + (N − l)∆P and

z P0 = 1

P (tN +l)

P0

=

z + N − l

but obviously V (tN +l) 6= V (tN −l) .

The choice of the values of N and n1 (the number of steps of the isothermal
process at T0) are somehow free, even if they depend on the geometry of the
vessel and on choice of the mass of the single dw. Here we ﬁnd convenient the
values N = 610 and n1 = 410.

The state PAVA is therefore reached in n1 time-steps in isothermal conditions.
The height of the piston at each step, i.e. H(ti) can be determined from the ideal
gas state equation P (ti)V (ti) = RT0, which, together with the relation

gives

Let denote with H1(ti) and ∆H1(ti) the values given by relations (2) and (3),
which are relative to the ﬁrst n1 steps.

It is obvious that for each isothermal step ∆T (ti) = 0; not obvious is the
estimate of the Entropic change of the Universe for an isothermal step, in the
Appendix we ﬁnd ∆SU (ti) ≃ R( ∆P

P )2, where R is the Universal gas constant.

The state PBVB is reached in n2 = 200 time-steps in adiabatic conditions
(thermal contact replaced by an adiabatic wall). For the adiabatic steps we
cannot use P (ti)V (ti)γ = Const. Nevertheless by means of the First Law of
thermodynamics and the equation of state of the ideal gases in the Appendix we
ﬁnd that

Let call ∆H2(ti) the raising of piston. From (4) we can evaluate H2(ti), the height
of the piston in each of the n2 adiabatic steps.

The ﬁnal height reached is HB = H2(tN ) = 0.344 cm.
In the adiabatic compression the temperature of the ideal gas increases at each
time-step. The thermal increase at each step can be calculated taking in account
the First Law of Thermodynamics for an adiabatic process, i.e. ∆U = −P ∆V,
and the ideal gas property ∆U = CV ∆T, where U is the Internal Energy and CV
the molar speciﬁc heat at constant volume. We have

Finally removing the last n4 dw′s in adiabatic conditions we come back to
the initial state V0, P0, T0. In this last process we can evaluate ∆H4(ti) trough
a relation similar to (4). H4(ti) can consequently be determined. Now at each
step the temperature decreases; the entropic change, as before, is ∆SU (ti) ≃

Figure 4: Raising of the piston step by step.Observe the discontinuities in the
raising of the piston going from the isothermal process to the adiabatic process
and vice-versa. i.e. around the states A, B and C

In this section we ﬁnd the raising of each dw and show that some of them move
down (have negative raising) and that the remaining majority move up (have
positive raising). The history of the single dw is relevant to evaluate its raising.
To this end let us label each dw. The kth dw is the one placed on the piston at
the kth time-step (k ∈ (1...N)). So the N thdw is the last one. The raising of the
kth dw at the end of the cycle, hk, is its vertical shift on the support, i.e. the
diﬀerence between the ﬁnal and the initial position on the supports.

Really relevant is the order in which they are removed from the piston. Two
are the possible ways in which we can start to remove them: a) from the N th, b)
from the (N − L)th with 1 ≤ L < N.

In the following we report on both cases for non-random processes:

in the
case a) we start from the N th and continue with the (N − 1)th until the 1th; in the
case b) we start from the (N − L)th, go on with the (N − L + 1)th until the N th
and then continue with the (N − L − 1)th until the 1th. We call these processes
respectively a − processes and b − processes. Obviously the expansion process
can be done in N! ways. For example you can start with N th dw, go regularly
to the (N − R)th then jump to the (N − 2R)th and then return to the (N − R)th
and continue; otherwise you can start from the (N − L)th go to the N th, jump
to the (N − 2L)th, return to the (N − L − 1)th and so on and so on. Once all
the possible regular processes have been exhausted one can go to the random-

processes. The nice aspect is that for each process we have a diﬀerent distribution
of the hk. With the complexity of the distribution of the hk we recover some of
the complexity of the microscopic behavior of the ideal gas.

a − processes. Let the ﬁrst removed be the N th. The individual raising are
related to the raising of the piston, therefore it is clear that hN , the raising
of the last dw (which has been on the piston just for one step) is given by
hN = ∆H(tN ) = H(tN ) − H(tN −1) and for the last but one dw (which has been
on the piston just for two steps) it is clear that hN −1 = ∆H(tN −1) + ∆H(tN ) +
∆H(tN +1) = H(tN +1) − H(t(N −1)−1).

Therefore for the (N − r)th dw, with r ∈ (0, .., N − 1), we have

which immediately gives

hN −r =

1
S

[ V (tN +r) − V (tN −r−1) ]

(8)

This last relation is useful since it enables to appreciate the raising of the dw
directly from an inspection of the P − V diagram of the Carnot-cycle : we have
only to observe that V (tN +r) is the volume occupied by the gas in the expansion
at pressure P (tN +r) and that V (tN −r−1) is the volume in the compression at the
lower pressure P (tN −r−1) = P (tN −r) − ∆P. In this way at each step we can ﬁnd
δV = V (tN +r) − V (tN −r−1), which is relative to just one ∆P. From the P − V
diagram of the Carnot-cycle we see that δV is negative only for the ﬁrst steps and
last steps, respectively. In ﬁg 5, on a schematic representation of the extremities
of the cycle, some positive and negative δV ’s are shown. Therefore we see that
the raising hk is negative only for the ﬁrst and the last steps and is positive for
all the others. From this analysis, moreover, we can understand that for the
a − processes the number of negative raisings depends on how big is ∆P. For
∆P → 0 that number goes to zero.

The values of hN −r are obtained from equation (8) together with relations

(2), (4), (6) and are reported in Figure 6.

Now we go to b − processes.
If the ﬁrst dw removed is the (N − L)th with 1 ≤ L < N, the histories of
the single dw′s change. The (N − L)thdw has been on the piston during the last
L + 1 steps of the compression and we have

hN −L =

N

Xi=N −L

∆H(ti) = H(tN ) − H(tN −L−1).

Figure 5: a) Positive and negative values of ∆V around the N th step. b) Positive
and negative values of ∆V around the 2N th step. The representation is schematic:
the step-wise aspect of the cycle is not reported .

For (N − (L − 1))th dw, which has been on the piston for the last L steps of
the compression and for the ﬁrst step of the expansion (that one in which the
(N − L)th dw is removed) we have

hN −(L−1) =

N

Xi=N −(L−1)

∆H(ti) + ∆H(tN +1) = H(tN +1) − H(tN −L)

Therefore, if we denote with hL

hL

N −r =

S

[V (tN +L−r) − V (tN −r−1)]

(12)

This relation too is useful to appreciate the raising of the dw′s directly from an
inspection of the P − V diagram of the Carnot-cycle : we can observe that
V (tN +L−r) is the volume occupied by the gas in the expansion at pressure
P (tN +L−r) = P0(z + N − (L − r))/z and that V (tN −r−1) is the volume in
the compression at the pressure P (tN −r−1) = P0(z + N − r − 1)/z. So δV =
V (tN +L−r) − V (tN −r−1) is relative to a δP = P0(2r + 1 − L)/z, and it is possible
to see that for δP > 0 we have δV < 0 and hence hL
N −r < 0 and for δP < 0
we have δV > 0 and hence hL
N −r > 0. For example, for r = L we have δP =

is fulﬁlled for these two processes since the work performed by the ideal gas in
the cycle is the same, whichever removing process is performed. This identity
can be veriﬁed using relations (8) and (12).

We conclude this section pointing out that a deeper insight in the cycle can
be obtained through the time-dependent raising hN −r(tN +l) for l ∈ (1...N). The
raising we are dealing with in this paper are the hN −r(t2N ) i.e. the raising of the
dw′s at the end of the cycle.

6 Conclusions

The detailed analysis of the classical Carnot cycle we have followed here shows
a fruitful complexity in the behaviour of small driving weights, whose energetic
gain can stimulate further speculations. A deeper insight in the cycle can be
obtained trough the time-dependent raisings hN −r(ti), for instance it would be
interesting to study the eﬀect, on the individual raising hN −r(ti), of the fact that
the adiabatic works in the Carnot-cycle for an ideal gas cancel each other. The
estimate of the Eﬃciency and of the Dissipated Work in our step-wise cycle may
be useful to give a deeper insight on the relation among them.
In particular
we plan to show in a forthcoming paper that the eﬃciency of an arbitrary non
reversible engine running between Tmin and Tmax, ηIrre(Tmin, Tmax), is equal to the
eﬃciency of a suitable step-wise ideal gas Carnot engine ηstep(Tmin, Tmax, ∆P ). All
these are conceptual aspects. It would moreover be useful to have some practical

1) Isothermal processes

For each time-step ti we have P (ti)V (ti) = RT, T being the constant

temperature at which the process is performed

To evaluate ∆SU (ti) = ∆Ssys(ti) + ∆Senv(ti) we ﬁrst observe that :

∆U = 0 ⇒ ∆Q = ∆W = P ∆V = P (ti)[V (ti) − V (ti−1)]

and

V (ti−1) − V (ti)

V (ti)

=

P (ti) − P (ti−1)

Note that during the expansion V (ti−1) − V (ti) > 0 whereas during the
compression V (ti−1) − V (ti) < 0, so in the following we will use |∆V | , when
necessary. So

∆SU (ti) ∼= R(cid:18)∆P

2) Adiabatic processes

For the adiabatic steps a priori we cannot use P (ti)V (ti)γ = C. Nevertheless
for an adiabatic compression-step, from the First Law of thermodynamics we
have ∆U = −∆W = −P ∆V = P (ti)[V (ti−1) − V (ti)] > 0, but ∆U =
CV (T (ti) − T (ti−1)), so from the state equation P V = RT we obtain

CV (T (ti) − T (ti−1)) = R[

P (ti)
P (ti−1)

T (ti−1) − T (ti)]

i.e.

(CV + R)T (ti) = RT (ti−1)(cid:18) P (ti)

P (ti−1)

+

CV

R (cid:19)

(34)

which gives T (ti) and therefore, since CP = CV + R

V (ti) =

RP (ti−1)V (ti−1)

P (ti)CP

P (ti−1)

CV

and recalling that γ = cP /cV

this can be written

This relation is general
for an ideal gas since it connects the ﬁnal volume to
the initial volume for an irreversible adiabatic compression in which the external
pressure is suddenly increased.

so for small ∆P steps we can evaluate ∆V from P (ti)V (ti)γ = C.

To evaluate ∆SU for an adiabatic step we need only ∆Ssys. From the First

Law we have

In the adiabatic expansion ∆P < 0 and ∆V > 0, but these changes do not alter
the value of the entropic gain we have found in the compression.

From relations (33) and (39) we can conclude that in the step-wise Carnot

cycle

Since for each process
∆SU (ti) ∼ (∆P/P )2 .

consider a ﬁnite number of steps. As it is show in Appendix, increasing the
steps number we approximate better a reversible cycle.

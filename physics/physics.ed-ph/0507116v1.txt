Thermal Expansion Puzzles

Abstract

The standard formula that describes the thermal expansion of a solid
creates several puzzles for discerning students. Three puzzles are reviewed,
and their common resolution discussed both conceptually and quantita-
tively.

1 Which starting length?

Undergraduate textbooks provide the following formula for use in calculating the
change in length, in some direction, of a solid heated between two temperatures
To and Tf ,

Lf = Lo(1 + α∆T )
(1)
with ∆T ≡ Tf − To and α the coeﬃcient of linear thermal expansion. Some
books do mention that the formula is approximate, valid when α is small, and
that experimentally α is constant for small ∆T [1].

However even with those cautions, puzzles arise. The ﬁrst: the change in
length, ∆L = Lf −Lo, in (1) depends on the starting length Lo; but if the length
is continually changing with tempertaure, then how should the formula be used?
For example, one can imagine the same physical process but performed in N
small steps involving temperature changes δT ≡ ∆T /N , so that the length at
the end of step n is given by

Ln = Ln−1(1 + αδT ) ,

assuming, for simplicity of discussion, that α is a constant independent of tem-
perature. After N steps one achieves a temperature change of ∆T , and the
length becomes

LN = Lo(1 + αδT )N .

= αL ,

L = Lo exp[A(T )] ,

This expression is clearly very diﬀerent from (1) eventhough the physical pro-
cess, a temperature change of ∆T , is identical! For αδT small one may truncate
the binomial expansion of (3), giving

LN ≈ Lo(1 + α∆T ) ,

which does agrees with (1). Through this example, one concludes that formula
(1) is self-consistent only to order α∆T .

Of course it would be nice to have a formula that is consistent to all orders.

The way to obtain it is to write (1) as

which emphasizes that the change in L depends on the value of L at that
moment. So the proper procedure is to consider inﬁnitesimal changes and write
the process in calculus notation,

an equation that can be easily integrated to give [2]

where A(T ) ≡
and can also be used for large α.

To αdT . The expression (7) is valid even when α is not a constant
R

As discussed in Ref.[2], a virtue of the exact equation (7) is that it indicates
the two approximations required to obtain (1): ﬁrstly, for α approximately con-
stant, one may write A(T ) ≈ α∆T . Then a power series expansion of the expo-
nential gives the usual textbook formula, correct to order α∆T , in agreement
with the conclusion reached above using self-consistency arguments.

The result (7) can be obtained in a slightly diﬀerent way which emphasizes
the expansion of the solid in small steps: If α changes with temperature, then
the generalisation of (3) is

where αi is the coeﬃcient of expansion during the small interval i. Thus

limit N → ∞, while keeping ∆T = N δT ﬁxed gives, using the deﬁnition of an
integral,

which is the same as Eq.(7).

2 Irreversibility?

A puzzle that has been much discussed in the literature is the apparent irre-
versibility of length change as predicted by (1). For, applying successive changes
of ∆T and −∆T leads to

Lf = Lo(1 + α∆T )(1 − α∆T )

= Lo(1 − (α∆T )

)

(14)

and a shrinking rod [3]. However, there is clearly no shrinkage when the exact
expression (7) is used, as noted in [4].

That the result (14) is doubtful could have been deduced as follows. As
discussed in the last section, the expression (1) is valid only to order α∆T and
so any results obtained by using it cannot be trusted at subleading orders. In
particular, the negative quadratic term in (14) is unreliable. So again, this
puzzle evaporates when one uses consistency arguments.

3 When can a rod pass through a ring?

Suppose that at a temperature To rod with circular cross-section has a diameter
d1 while a ring has an inner diameter of d2 < d1. The coeﬃcient of linear
expansion of the rod is α1 while that of the ring α2. To simplify the discussion,
let us assume that the expansion coeﬃcients are temperature independent. Is it
possible to make the rod pass through the ring by heating them to some common
higher temperature? Intuitively one would expect that the answer is yes as long
as the ring expands faster than the rod, α2 > α1. However a direct calculation
using (1) produces an unexpected conclusion. Let us investigate this.
After a temperature change of ∆T the relevant diameters become,

d2f = d2(1 + α2∆T ) ,
d1f = d1(1 + α1∆T ) .

For the rod to pass through the ring requires d2f ≥ d1f , which when applied

to the previous two equations gives

(α2d2 − α1d1)∆T ≥ (d1 − d2) .

Since d1 > d2 and since ∆T has been assumed to be positive, there is a

physical solution if and only if,

giving

α2d2 − α1d1 > 0 ,

∆T ≥

(d1 − d2)
(α2d2 − α1d1)

.

The constraint (18) is physically obscure.

It may be written as d2/d1 >

α1/α2 and when combined with d1 > d2 it implies the expected condition

α2 > α1 .

(20)

However, as the derivation above shows, the desired outcome (20) is only a
necessary condition but not suﬃcient by itself, the stronger condition (18) being
required. By now the reader must have guessed that the conclusion (18) might
be an artifact of using the approximate relation (1). That is indeed the case:
Performing a similar analyis but adopting instead the exact expression (7) with
constant expansion coeﬃcients gives

For the rod to pass through the ring, the right-hand-side of the last equation
must be at least equal to one, and taking logarithms gives

which is satisﬁed once α2 > α1. That is, an exact analysis does show the
intuitive condition to be suﬃcient.

It is instructive to compare the exact minimum temperature change at which

the rod passes through the ring,

with the approximate expression from (19). The approximate expression should
follow from the exact value when the relative expansions are small, meaning
α∆T ≪ 1. In that regime, the diameters of the rod and ring must be very close,
d1 − d2 ∼ O(α∆T ). So

4 Summary

Assuming for simplicity that α is temperature independent, a self-consistency
argument was used to show that the standard textbook formula (1) could only
be correct to order α∆T . This is equivalent to saying that only small relative
expansions can be dealt with using that formula, a condition which is fortunately
satisﬁed in common applications because of the tiny value of α, in common units,
for real solids.

The various paradoxes result from using the standard formula beyond its
regime of validity. For more precise investigations one should use the exact
expression (7) which can deal not only with large expansions but also includes
the more realistic case of a temperature varying α. The expression (7) was
originally derived in Ref.[2] and has been re-derived here through an explicit
limiting procedure.

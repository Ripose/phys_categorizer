When a substance that shrinks in volume as it solidiﬁes
(for example, lead) is melted in a container and then cooled,
a deep hole is often found in the center after resolidiﬁcation.
We use a simple model to describe the shape of the pipe and
compare it with experimental results.

In an experiment that involves atomic beams of thal-
lium [1], it was noticed that a deep narrow hole was
formed in the thallium that melted and resolidiﬁed. The
hole that formed was at the center of the container and
extended from the surface to nearly the bottom. It was
surmised that the phenomenon was due to the change in
volume of thallium during solidiﬁcation. Such formation
is sometimes known as “pipe” in metallurgy [2]. In this
note, we discuss a simple model of pipe formation and
compare it with straightforward experiments that can be
carried out in classrooms.

Suppose a molten substance is cooling in a circular
cylinder. Assuming that solidiﬁcation occurs from the
side walls of the container inwards in the radial direction
and neglecting the surface tension eﬀects, we should ex-
pect the liquid level to drop as a layer of solid is formed
because of the higher density of the solid. Consider a
newly solidiﬁed layer of thickness dr. Let ρs and ρl be
the solid and liquid densities respectively, and let h(r)
be the height of solid as a function of radius r. Equat-
ing the mass before and after solidiﬁcation, one obtains
a diﬀerential equation:
πr2hρl = π(r − dr)

(h − dh)ρl + 2πrhdrρs.

Keeping only ﬁrst order diﬀerentials, we get:

With the boundary condition of h(R) = h0, where R and
h0 are the radius of the container and the initial liquid
level respectively, the solution is:

the center, the shape of which, for a given container and
liquid volume, is determined by α, the fractional density
change.

With this simple model in mind, we have performed
solidiﬁcation experiments with various substances (this
time omitting the highly toxic thallium). The changes in
densities upon solidiﬁcation for these materials and for
thallium are listed in Table I [2–4]. As expected, pipes
are observed in all materials tested except Wood’s metal
(an alloy of 50% Bi, 25% Pb, 12.5% Cd and 12.5% Sn).
Indeed, Wood’s metal has the property that the volume
changes little during solidiﬁcation. Note that for sub-
stances that expand upon solidiﬁcation (water, bismuth,
antimony and gallium), no ”anti-pipe” is formed because
the liquid is pushed out by the expanded solidiﬁed ma-
terial and assumes a horizontal level.

Photographs of several experimental samples are
shown in Figures 2-5. Figure 2 shows a sample of conven-
tional solder alloy (60% lead, 40% tin) that was melted
and poured into a glass beaker where it cooled and solid-
iﬁed. The sample was then cut through the center of the
pipe, the resulting cross-section is shown in Figure 3.

Comparing the shape of the pipe predicted by our sim-
ple model (Fig. 1) to the one observed experimentally
(Figs. 2 and 3), one ﬁnds that, while the shape is repro-
duced qualitatively, there are also signiﬁcant discrepan-
cies. First, the pipe does not actually go to the bottom
of the container as the model predicts. Second, the pipe
in the experiment turns out to be much wider. Presum-
ably this is because we have assumed that solidiﬁcation
occurs only from the sides (see below).

In fact, when cooling from the surface and the bottom
becomes signiﬁcant, other scenarios in addition to pipe
formation are possible. Fig. 4 shows a solidiﬁed lead
sample, in which a layer of solid on the surface covers
the pipe, turning it into a cavity. We can see that the
cavity width is greater than the pipe width predicted
from Equation 3. Qualitatively this can be understood
from the requirement of mass conservation: the material
solidiﬁed on the top does not have a chance to ﬁll the
pipe.

To reduce the relative solidiﬁcation rate from the sur-
face, we attempted accelerated cooling from the sides by
putting a beaker with molten solder into a water bath.
This time, instead of a deep pipe, a surface recession
shown in Fig. 5 was observed. To explain this observa-
tion, we modiﬁed the model by adding a term to account

for solidiﬁcation from the bottom.

Let k be the ratio of the solidiﬁcation rate of the bot-
tom to that of the sides. In order to keep the model as
simple as possible, we assume k = hr=0/R. (Note that
this would not be a valid approximation for large k. If
the solidiﬁcation from the bottom is suﬃciently rapid,
the entire substance solidiﬁes before solidiﬁcation from
the sides reaches r = 0. In the cases discussed here, how-
ever, the liquid level is high and the cooling rate from
the bottom is about the same as that from the sides, so
the assumption can be safely granted.) The diﬀerential
equation analogous to Equation 1, with the shorthand
h′ = h − k(R − r), is then:

Simplifying, we get

The solution is a long algebraic expression, which we omit
here, but the solution plot (for k = 1) is given in Fig. 6.
Comparing it to the picture of the sample (Fig. 5), one
can ﬁnd close resemblance between the two.

So far we have neglected the eﬀect of surface tension
(a simple discussion of surface tension is given in [6], for
example). If wetting occurs at the solid-liquid interface
of the solidifying substance, the surface of the liquid will
not be ﬂat, and the curvature of the surface will aﬀect
the ﬁnal shape of the solid. However, it is reasonable
to assume that this eﬀect only becomes signiﬁcant when
the dimension of the contained liquid is ”capillary” —
i.e., the radius of curvature of the surface near the wall, a,
becomes comparable to the radius of the liquid surface, r.
From dimensional analysis, we expect a2 ∼ σ
ρg . Plugging
in realistic parameters, for example, ρl = 104kg/m3(for
metal), σ = 0.5N/m, we obtain a ∼ 2mm. This means
that surface tension only becomes important near the
center of the container. The eﬀect should be observable
at the bottom of the pipe. Qualitatively, we would expect
the bottom to be more concave than predicted by our
model due to the curved liquid surface, and this is indeed
the case (see Fig. 3).

In conclusion, we have discussed the mechanism of for-
mation of surface pipes upon resolidiﬁcation of materials
with ρl/ρs < 1. These prominent formations can often be
observed in solder pots, candle containers, etc. They are
important in metallurgy [2] where they have to be taken
into account in casting processes. Similar formations also
occur in igneous rocks due to density changes of magma
on solidiﬁcation [5]. However, it is often diﬃcult to sepa-
rate this eﬀect from a large number of other factors that
determine the structure and texture of igneous rocks.

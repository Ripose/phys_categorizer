Abstract

We describe light-reﬂection properties of spherically curved mirrors, like balls in the
Christmas tree. In particular, we study the position of the image which is formed some-
where beyond the surface of a spherical mirror, when an eye observes the image of a
pointlike light source. The considered problem, originally posed by Abu Ali Hasan Ibn
al-Haitham — alias Alhazen — more than a millennium ago, turned out to have the
now well known analytic solution of a biquadratic equation, being still of great relevance,
e.g. for the aberration-free construction of telescopes. We do not attempt to perform
an exhaustive survey of the rich historical and engineering literature on the subject, but
develop a simple pedagogical approach to the issue, which we believe to be of continuing
interest in view of its maltreating in many high-school textbooks.

Introduction

The basic property of geometrical optics for reﬂection is the equality of the angles of incidence
and reﬂection, given by the equation

t = i

.

(1)

Here, we will demonstrate that equality (1) is not respected when analyzing curved mirrors,
in particular spherical mirrors, in the educational programs for high-school and university
students.

One of the corner stones of geometrical optics at the high-shool level is the concept of ideal
lens, which reduces the lens to an optical plane, principal and auxiliary axes, and a focal plane
with principal and auxiliary foci. The rules for image formation are clear: incident light rays
parallel to an auxiliary axis are refracted in the lens such that the refracted light ray passes
through the corresponding auxiliary focus in the case of a positive ideal lens, or seem to originate
from the corresponding auxiliary focus for a negative ideal lens. No further rules are needed to
construct images for any ideal lens or set of ideal lenses. This concept is not only useful, as it
approximates well real lenses applied in optical instruments, but also a practical application of
Euclidean geometry.

2

However, ideal lenses should not be confused with ideal spherical mirrors. The ideal spherical
mirror is a mirror in the form of a perfect sphere. No simple rules can be applied to construct
its images. Nevertheless, almost all physics courses for high-school and undergraduate students
contain ﬁgures similar [1] to the one represented in Fig. 1a, in order to demonstrate image
formation in convex (or concave) spherical mirrors. In Fig. 1b we show the results of measuring

Figure 1: The image of the light source is assumed at the intersection of the directions in
which observers 2 and 3 are supposed to receive light rays originating from the light source and
reﬂected by the mirror. The light ray for observer 2 seems to come from the direction of the
supposed focus F at the supposed principal axis of the mirror, since the incident light ray, from
the light source to the mirror, is parallel to the supposed principal axis. Similarly, the light
ray for observer 3 is reﬂected in the direction parallel to the supposed principal axis, since it is
emitted by the light source in the direction of the supposed focus. In the right-hand ﬁgure we
show the incident and reﬂection angles with respect to the local normal direction at the various
vertices.

the incident i and reﬂection t angles at each of the vertices, applying simple Euclidean geometry.
Being rather obvious for observer 5, we actually ﬁnd that none of the vertices respects relation
(1). We must therefore conclude that Fig. 1a cannot be correct.

The latter conclusion is no surprise, of course. Since a perfect spherical mirror is spherically
symmetric, any choice of principal axis is as good (or bad) as any other. Descartes’ formula
for the position of an image does not imply the existence of a focus. It just provides a simple
method to determine the place of the image for an observer positioned right behind the light
source with respect to the center of the sphere. For observers which are just a very small angle

3

away from that direction, it constitutes a reasonable approximation. The method given by
Descartes can thus perfectly well be applied to optical instruments, where long tubes guarantee
that the angles involved are small. However, for the images observed in Christmas balls, it is
not a correct method to be applied.

In the following paragraphs, we shall show a simple method of how to determine the images
seen by each of the observers in Fig. 1. We are well aware that similar demonstrations must
have been presented long ago. But unfortunately, we have not found any references to such
work. Since, moreover, it seems to have been completely forgotten, we judged it useful to
present our material to a wider public than just our students.

2 Reﬂection.

Let us consider a pointlike light source and a spherical mirror. We assume that the eye lens
is small enough to be considered pointlike as well. The relevant light rays must all be in the
plane determined by the center of the sphere, the position of the light source, and the eye.
Consequently, we may study the subject in two dimensions.

We take the center of the circle, which has radius R, at the origin of the coordinate system.
In Fig. 2 we show a light ray emitted by a light source located at (xs, ys), and reﬂected by the
spherically curved mirror at the vertex (x, y).

Figure 2: A light ray emitted by the light source at (xs, ys) is reﬂected by the spherical mirror.
The incident angle i and the reﬂection angle t at the surface of the mirror are equal: i = t ≡ ϕ.
The vector connecting the coordinate origin to the vertex at (x, y) makes an angle β with the
horizontal axis.

Since we are essentially left with a two-dimensional problem, we may perform the geometrical
calculations by using complex numbers. Thus, let us deﬁne the complex numbers a (object
location) and r (vertex location), i.e.,

a = xs + iys and r = x + iy = R eiβ .

The vector a − r points in the direction of the incident light ray. Furthermore, the angle
i = t ≡ ϕ (see Fig. 2) is deﬁned by

Consequently,

a − r = |a − r| ei(β−ϕ)

.

When by using Eq. (4) we rotate the vector a − r over an angle 2ϕ, i.e.,

then we obtain a vector in the direction of the reﬂected light ray. Using now Eq. (5), we deduce

3 The image

The small bundle of light rays which strikes the eye lens has a very small area of convergence,
as can be understood from Fig. 3. This small area is where the eye supposes the light rays are

location.

stemming from, hence the image of the light source.

By varying the angle β in Fig. 2, we obtain diﬀerent trajectories for light rays originating
from the same light source at a. We are here interested in the intersection of the straight lines
that coincide with the reﬂected rays of two diﬀerent suchlike trajectories. We indicate their
vertices by r and r′, respectively. In accordance with formula (6), we may represent the two
straight lines coinciding with the two reﬂected rays by (λ, λ′ real)

s(λ) = r + λ

and

The intersection of the two trajectories follows from

s(λ) = s′(λ′)

,

which, since λ and λ′ are real, actually corresponds to two equations, one for the real part and
one for the imaginary part, namely

s(λ) + s∗(λ) = s′(λ′) + s′∗

(λ′)

and

s(λ) − s∗(λ) = s′(λ′) − s′∗

(λ′)

.

(9)

We can solve for λ and λ′ and substitute the results into expressions (7), so as to obtain for
the point of intersection xs(r, r′) of the two lines the result

In Fig. 4 we show some pictures. We indicate the positions of the light source, the eye, and
the center of the spherical mirror. Three diﬀerent light rays are reﬂected on the surface of the
sphere and then reach the eye. We assume the location of the image to lie where these rays
intersect one another. A small red dot labeled by i indicates the position of the image for the
central direction, which follows from Eq. (15).

The reason that we see a “sharp” image of the pointlike light source is due to the smallness
of our eye lens. More accurately, it stems from the ratio of the diameter of the pupil of the eye
and the curvature radius R of the spherical mirror. Hence, perfectly sharp images are only to be
expected for an inﬁnite radius of curvature, which just represents a ﬂat mirror. Nevertheless,
for large spherical mirrors, the resolution of the virtual image observed by the eye is good
enough to be considered sharp. However, its location depends on the position of the eye.

The question is how to determine the angle β in the case that the positions of the light source
(xs, ys) and the eye (x0, y0) are given.

Let us deﬁne the complex number b for the coordinates of the eye lens, i.e.,

From Fig. 2, and in analogy with Eq. (4), we obtain

4.1 The solutions to Eq. (23)

The biquadratic Eq. (23) is in the literature known as the Billiard Problem of al-Hasan, named
after the Arab scientist Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham (965–1040 A.D.) [2,3]. It corresponds
to the following problem, which had already been formulated in 150 A.D. by the Greek scientist
Ptolemy: “Find, for arbitrary initial positions of the red ball and the white ball, the point on
the edge of a circular billiard table at which the white ball must be aimed in order to carom
once oﬀ the edge and collide head-on with the red ball”.

From the deﬁnitions of a, b, r, and the subsequent deﬁnition of β in Eq. (2), it may be clear
that reﬂection in the interior of the circle representing the cross section of the spherical mirror
can be studied in exactly the same way as reﬂection in the exterior, by considering r − a instead
of a − r, and r − b instead of b − r, which leads to exactly the same Eq. (23).

In general, there are four solutions z1, z2, z3, and z4 to the equation

Hovever, when |z| 6= 1, the solution to Eq. (24) is not a physical solution to Eq. (23). Although
we have not studied the situation exhaustively, we ﬁnd that generally there are two solutions
to Eq. (23), but sometimes there are four, depending on the complex parameters a and b. The

In the
left-hand picture, we have an example where there are only two solutions to Eq. (23). The
right-hand picture shows an example where, by just selecting a diﬀerent position of the red ball,
we ﬁnd four solutions.

diﬀerent cases, corresponding to a = 0, b = 0, a = b = 0, |a| = R, |b| = R, and |a| = |b| = R,
must be studied separately. In Fig. 5 we show two examples for a circular billiard.

5 Deformation

Now that we have solved the problem of ﬁnding the vertex on the curved mirror where the
light ray passing from the object to the eye is reﬂected, we may construct the images for the
situation shown in Fig. 1. The result is depicted in Fig. 6.

Figure 6: The locations of the various images as seen by each of the ﬁve observers introduced
in Fig. 1. We also indicate the angles of incidence and reﬂection, in order to make sure that
they are equal.

6 Conclusions

The complete resolution of the Billiard Problem (23), posed by al-Hasan in the context of what
nowadays is called geometric optics, had to wait for many centuries. First it was necessary to
derive an analytic form for the solutions to biquadratic equations like Eq. (24). Apparently
found by Ferrari, it was published for the ﬁrst time in Cardano’s “Ars Magna” in 1545. The
ﬁrst one to subsequently solve the Billiard Problem of al-Hasan was Christiaan Huyghens.

The problem would probably have ended up in the history books, since “once solved, forever
solved”. However, for optical equipment, where the angles of reﬂection ϕ are small, Descartes
formulated an approximation, amounting to basically linear equations. Anything that has larger
reﬂection angles is considered an aberration in his philosophy. Ever since, a whole generation
of physicists emerged completely unaware of al-Hasan’s Billiard Problem, who systematically
applied Descartes’ approximation also to large angles ϕ, thus arriving at totally wrong conclu-
sions. Therefore, we should rub up al-Hasan’s Billiard Problem, and reintroduce it in our optics
courses, so that new generations can fully enjoy the perfectly sharp images in Christmas balls,
without feeling uneasy for having been told that such wonderful images should be considered
aberrations.

For undergraduate students the full subject can be treated, involving some simple computer
programming. One can either choose a point on the spherical mirror, and construct the image
by the use of formulae (15) and from the direction of the reﬂected light ray, or one can select
the position of the eye pupil, and determine the vertex by means of Eq. (23). However, for
youngsters at high schools, we recommend to only deal with it qualitatively, using examples
like Figs. 3 and 6.

Abstract

Relying on the equivalence principle, a ﬁrst approach of the general theory of relativity is pre-

sented using the spacetime metric of an observer with a constant proper acceleration. Within this

non inertial frame, the equation of motion of a freely moving object is studied and the equation of

motion of a second accelerated observer with the same proper acceleration is examined. A com-

parison of the metric of the accelerated observer with the metric due to a gravitational ﬁeld is also

performed.

INTRODUCTION

The study of a motion with a constant proper acceleration is a classical exercise of special

relativity that can be found in many textbooks [1, 2, 3]. With its analytical solution, it is

possible to show that the limit speed of light is asymptotically reached despite the constant

proper acceleration. The very prominent notion of event horizon can be introduced in a

simple context and the problem of the twin paradox can also be analysed. In many articles

of popularisation, it is sometimes stated that the point of view of an observer with a constant

proper acceleration cannot be treated within the theory of special relativity and that theory

of general relativity is absolutely necessary. Actually, this is not true. The point of view of

an uniformly accelerated observer has been studied, for instance, in Refs. [1, 2, 4, 5]. In this

paper, some particular topics are summed up and developed.

The metric for an observer with a proper constant acceleration (coming from inﬁnity and

coming back towards inﬁnity) is built in Sec. II by considering a series of inertial frames

instantaneously at rest with this observer. The notions of local time and local velocity for

such an observer are introduced in Secs. III and IV. In particular, the equation of motion of

a freely moving object is studied in Sec. V and its local velocity calculated in Sec. VI. The

problem of the distance existing between two accelerated observers with the same constant

proper acceleration [6, 7, 8] is examined in Sec. VII, in terms of the metric associated with

one of the accelerated observer. At last, the metric of the accelerated observer is compared

with the metric due to a gravitational ﬁeld in Sec. VIII.

The equivalence principle of the general theory of relativity states that a gravitational

ﬁeld and an acceleration ﬁeld are locally equivalent. This means that, in a suﬃciently small

region of space and for a suﬃciently small duration, the gravitational ﬁeld can be cancelled

in a suitable accelerated frame. Conversely, a gravitational ﬁeld can be simulated by an

accelerated frame. Thus, this paper can be considered as a ﬁrst approach of the general

theory of relativity by studying the point of view of an accelerated observer.

II. METRIC OF AN OBSERVER WITH A CONSTANT PROPER ACCELERA-

TION

The equation of motion, along a straight line, of an accelerated observer with a constant

proper acceleration can be found in a great number of textbooks [1, 2, 3] (in the following,

the coordinates perpendicular to the velocity of the observer do not play any role and they
are ignored). If A is the modulus of the proper acceleration, v′ = dx′/dt′ the velocity of
the observer and ϕ′ = dv′/dt′ its acceleration along the x-axis, both measured in an inertial
frame R′, the one-dimensional equation of motion is given by

With the initial conditions v′ = 0 and x′ = 0 at t′ = 0, the integration of Eq. (1) gives

This motion is also called hyperbolic motion because the last equation can be recast into

the form

which is the equation of a branch of hyperbola in spacetime (see Fig. 1). The asymptotes of
this curve are the two straight lines with equations ct′ = ±(x′ + c2/A). The velocity of each
physical object is such that |dx′/dt′| ≤ c. This implies that the angle between the tangent

at each point of the world line of an object and the time-axis in Fig. 1 is always comprised

between 0 and π/4. Consequently, the asymptotes of the world line of the accelerated

observer deﬁnes two event horizons: The events “above” the future horizon cannot send any

information to the accelerated observer, who cannot send any information to events located

“below” the past horizon. These two event horizons will be discussed below.

FIG. 2: Building of the instantaneous proper frame R′′ of the accelerated observer. The event M

indicates the position of the observer in spacetime. The temporal coordinate of the event E is τ
for this observer and is t′′ = 0 in the inertial frame R′′.

The accelerated observer can now use the inertial frame R′′ to build a proper system of
coordinates. If an event E occurs at a time t′′ = 0 in the frame R′′, it is natural for the

accelerated observer to consider that this event occurs at the time t indicated by a clock of
the observer, since the time coordinate of the observer is also t′′ = 0 in the frame R′′ (see

Fig. 2). This time t is then identical to its proper time τ . It is also natural to assign at this

event E a position x in the proper frame of the observer which is identical to the position
x′′ of E in the frame R′′. Finally, the event E with spacetime coordinates (t′′ = 0, x′′) in the
frame R′′ has spacetime coordinates (t = τ, x = x′′) in the proper frame of the accelerated
observer. The relation (6) indicates that the proper time of the observer at time t′

It is worth mentioning that a spacetime with such a metric has no curvature, since this

metric is obtained from a ﬂat metric with a change of coordinates. It can be veriﬁed that

the calculation of the curvature tensor for the metric (13) gives a null scalar curvature, as

expected [2].

In the proper frame of the accelerated observer, called R here, each object with a position

x positive (negative) is located above (below) the observer, since the acceleration deﬁnes a

privileged vertical direction along the x-axis. It is worth noting that the metric (13) is not
deﬁned for x ≤ −c2/A. To understand why this position is so particular, it is necessary

to study the spacetime structure of the surroundings of the accelerated observer. With

relations (12), it is possible to determine the equations of the coordinates lines of the frame
R in the inertial frame R′. In this last frame, the equation of a coordinate line t with x = x0

This curve is a branch of hyperbola whose asymptotes are the two event horizons mentioned
above. These horizons are located on the degenerate asymptotes obtained with x0 = −c2/A
in Eq. (14). Obviously, the world line of the accelerated observer in the frame R′ is given

by x0 = 0. The equation of a coordinate line x with t = t0 constant is

This is a straight line containing the event (x′, ct′) = (−c2/A, 0), that is to say the intersec-

tion of the two event horizons. When t0 → ∞, the straight line is parallel to the bisector of
the axis x′ and ct′. Some coordinate lines are drawn in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the future

horizon and the past horizon correspond respectively to the time coordinate lines t = +∞
and t = −∞. Both horizons form also the space coordinate line x = −c2/A. The spacetime
region with x ≤ −c2/A is then behind the event horizons.

FIG. 4: Photons, emitted during a ﬁnite time ∆t′ by a stationary observer “below” the future
horizon in the inertial frame R′, can reach the uniformly accelerated observer after an inﬁnite

time.

The event horizons are then always located at a distance c2/A downward for the accel-

erated observer. In order to understand the nature of these horizons, let us assume that a

6

stationary observer in the inertial frame R′ sends photons to the accelerated observer: The
emission starts in order that the ﬁrst photons reach the accelerated observer at t = t′ = 0,

for instance; It stops when the stationary observer crosses the future horizon (photons emit-

ted later cannot be received). It is clear from Fig. 4 that all photons are received after an
inﬁnite time, despite the fact that they are emitted during a ﬁnite time ∆t′.

III. LOCAL TIME

Let us consider a clock at rest at position x in the proper frame R of the accelerated ob-

server. An interval of proper time dτ for this clock corresponding to an interval of coordinate

time dt is given by

dτ =

g(x) dt =

1 +

A x
c2

(cid:19)

dt,

(cid:18)

p

(16)

since dx = 0. Let us remark that the coordinate time is also the proper time at the level of

the accelerated observer (x = 0). The time ﬂows with the same rate for all clocks with the

same “altitude” in R (same value of x). On the contrary, clocks located at diﬀerent altitudes

measure diﬀerent intervals of proper time for a same interval of coordinate time. The time

ﬂows more slowly for all clocks located below a reference clock. In particular, the interval

of proper time dτ vanishes at the level of event horizons. For the accelerated observer, the
time “freezes” at the coordinate x = −c2/A (see Fig. 4).

It is worth noting that, for a value of A close to the terrestrial gravitational acceleration
(around 10 m/s2), c2/A is around one light year (1016 m). With this value of A, two clocks
located 1 m apart will be get out of synchronisation by about 1 s every 1016 s (around
3 × 108 yr).

An interval of local time can be deﬁned, d˜t =

g(x) dt, with which it is possible to build

in the vicinity of a particular event a local metric similar to the usual Minkowski metric

p

ds2 = c2d˜t 2 − dx2.

(17)

This metric can be considered as the metric of an inertial frame instantaneously at rest

with the proper frame of the accelerated observer. But, in this frame, the intervals of

time considered must be small enough in order that the accelerated frame do not move

appreciably. An interval of local time corresponds then to an interval of time measured

by a clock at rest in this instantaneous inertial frame. The metric (17) allows only a local

7

description of an inﬁnitesimal region of spacetime like a Minkowski spacetime with local
coordinates (x, ˜t).

IV. LOCAL VELOCITY

Let us consider two events E1 and E2 on the world line of an object that moves in the non

inertial frame R. The coordinate time interval between these events is dt and the coordinate

distance is dx. It is possible to deﬁne three types of velocity for this object:

• The coordinate velocity v = dx/dt.

• The proper velocity u = dx/dτ , which is the spatial part of the world velocity.

• The local velocity ˜v = dx/d˜t, computed with the interval of local time d˜t =

g(x) dt.

Hence, we have

and

v =

g(x) ˜v,

p

u =

˜v

1 − ˜v2/c2 =

v
g(x) − v2/c2 .

p

(18)

(19)

The local velocity ˜v is the coordinate velocity of the object in the inertial frame that is

p

p

instantaneously at rest relative to the non inertial frame of the accelerated observer (see

previous section). This velocity cannot thus exceed the speed of light. This is not the

case for the coordinate velocity v since, according to Eq. (18), v could exceed c if g(x) is

large enough. If the object is a photon, its local velocity ˜v must be the invariant c, but its

coordinate velocity varies as a function of its position.

V. EQUATION OF MOTION OF A FREELY MOVING OBJECT

The interval of proper time elapsed between two events inﬁnitesimally close on the world

line of a moving object in the non inertial frame is given by

dτ =

g(x) c2dt2 − dx2 =

g(x) − v2/c2 dt,

g(x(t)) − v2/c2 dt.

The principle of equivalence requires that the world line of a freely moving object that

passes through two ﬁxed events is such that the elapsed proper time between these two

events is maximum [1, 2]. If the integral (21) is written

∆τ =

L(t) dt with L(t) =

g(x(t)) − v2/c2,

(22)

then the calculus of variations shows that the functional L(t) must satisfy the following

= 0.

This is the Euler-Lagrange equation, which ensures that the quantity ∆τ is extremum.

Let us mention that this problem is formally identical to the computation of the minimal

length between two points on a curved space described by a spatial metric. The curve

satisfying this condition is called a geodesic. Here, the curve in space is replaced by a world

line in the spacetime and the variation produces a maximum in the lapse of proper time

instead of a minimum of spatial distance.

d2x/dt2 = 0, as expected, in the case of an inertial frame for which g(x) = 1.

function of its position in the non inertial frame. Multiplying both sides of this equation by

(cid:19)

With the notation w = v2/c2, this equation can be put into the form

This diﬀerential equation can be solved by using the separation of variables method, if one

introduces the new function y = w/g. But it is simpler to try a solution of the form

n=0
X
It is then easy to see that the coeﬃcients an are such that a0 = 0, a1 = 1, a2 is arbitrary

and am = 0 for m ≥ 3. So, we can write

where k is the constant of integration (k = −a2 in Eq. (30)). Using Eq. (18), the local

velocity of the freely moving object is given by

With this equation, it is possible to prove that the local velocity of an object cannot

exceed the speed of light if its local velocity is below c at one point of its world line. Since

g(x) is positive, ˜v can exceed c only if k is negative. Eq. (32) implies that

If we assume that ˜v < c at one point of its world line, then k > 0. Since k is a constant,

it is always positive and ˜v is always less than c. Alike, if the local velocity of a photon is

equal to c at one point of its world line, then k = 0. Consequently, k is null everywhere on

the world line and the local velocity of the photon is always equal to c. These results are

important since they show that the local velocity of an object cannot exceed the speed of

light and that the local velocity of a photon is always c.

The local velocity of a freely moving object has been calculated in the proper frame of

the accelerated observer. It is possible to compute this speed from the equation of motion
of the object given in the inertial frame R′. The two approaches must obviously give the

same result. With Eqs. (12), the function g(x) is given by

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

between the two velocities in the two frames is given by

where v′
0 = v′ is a constant since the object is moving freely. The quantity tanh(A t/c)
can be rewritten as a function of coordinates x′ and t′ using Eqs. (12). After inversion of

x′ = x′

where x′

velocity ˜v as a function of time t′ of the inertial frame, but it is more interesting to modify

Eq. (36) in order to recover Eq. (32). With the notation

With some calculations, it can then be shown, with Eqs. (36), (37) and (39), that the local

velocity of this object is given by

A simpler procedure exists to ﬁnd the value of k. Since it is a constant, it can be evaluated
at any time, for instance at t′ = 0. This constant is then given by formula (33) in which
˜v = v′

0, as explained above, and g = g(t′ = 0) = α2

0. So the formula (41) is obtained directly.

From these formulas, it is clear that ˜v = v′

0 = ±c for a photon, as expected. On the
event horizons (x = −c2/A), the function g is vanishing and the velocity of the object tends

towards the speed of light. From the point of view of the accelerated observer, he is at

inﬁnity when the object reaches a horizon (see Sec. II and Fig. 3), that is to say when its
velocity tends towards the speed of light in the inertial frame R′. The function g in Eq. (39)
is a quadratic form in t′ which possesses a maximum equal to α2
/c2). In this case,

0/(1 − v′
0

2

the local velocity is vanishing. The object and the accelerated observer have then the same
velocity in the inertial frame R′.

Finally, the relation (36) can be rewritten into the form

Since ˜v is only deﬁned for x′ > −c2/A and |A t′|/c < (1 + A x′/c2) (see Fig. 3), then |ν| < c.

Equation (42) is thus the relativistic addition of two velocities below the speed of light. It

is shown again that the local velocity ˜v cannot exceed c.

It is possible to give an interpretation of the speed ν. The equalities sinh(A t/c) =

sinh(A τ /c) = A t′

Using the Eqs. (34) and (43) in the formula (42) for ν, one can ﬁnd ν = v′

time t is then the relative speed between the constant velocity v′

VII. DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO OBSERVERS WITH A CONSTANT PROPER

ACCELERATION

Let us consider two spaceships with the same proper acceleration A moving in an inertial
frame R′. Their world lines, plotted in Fig. 5, are such that, at t′ = 0, they are a distance L
apart, at rest in R′. At each time in the inertial frame, the ships possess the same velocity

and are the same distance L apart. A rod of length L is ﬁxed between the two spaceships

when they are at rest. As the speed of the ships increases, the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction
will occur from the point of view of stationary observers in R′. This rod will then tend to

be lengthened by an increasing stress since the distance between the two ships is constant
in R′. This classical problem is studied in many papers (see for instance Refs. [6, 7, 8]).

FIG. 5: World lines (in bold), in an inertial frame, of two observers with the same proper accelera-

tion A. The distance between the two observers is constant in the inertial frame (L) but increases

in the proper frame of the ﬁrst observer (X(t)).

It is interesting to analyse this problem from the point of view of an observer on board a

ship. The parametric equations of motion of the ﬁrst ship, as a function of its proper time
τ , in the inertial frame R′ are (see Eqs. (6) and (8))

Clocks in all frames are synchronised: t′ = τ = η = 0. Let us note X the position of the

second spaceship in the proper frame of the ﬁrst one. The relations between the coordinates
in the frame R′ and the coordinates in the proper frame of the ﬁrst spaceship are given by

Eqs. (12). By introducing the coordinates (45) of the second ship in Eqs. (12), the following

relations between the proper times τ and η are found

From the point of view of an observer in the ﬁrst spaceship, the distance increases between

the two ships. This in agreement with the reasoning sustained above about the rod. This

phenomenon is due to the fact that the spaces of simultaneity for an observer on board the

ﬁrst space ship are diﬀerent from the spaces of simultaneity for a stationary observer in the
inertial frame. This can be seen on an example in Fig. 5 where L is ﬁxed at 0.5 c2/A: At

the time t = 0.6 c/A, X(t) is clearly greater then L.

VIII. METRIC AND GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL

In the Newtonian theory of gravity, the gravitational ﬁeld is derivable from a function
φ(x) call the gravitational potential. In a one-dimensional space, the acceleration d2x/dt2

of a freely falling object in an arbitrary frame is given by

In the vicinity of an accelerated observer, objects seems to undergo the eﬀects of a

gravitational ﬁeld (see Eq. (26)). One can ask what kind of relation could exist between

this pseudo gravitational ﬁeld and the metric of the accelerated observer. Eq. (49) has a

form similar to Eq. (24), which relates the acceleration with the spacetime metric. At the

classical limit, low velocity (v ≪ c) and near Minkowski metric (g ≈ 1), Eq. (24) reduces to

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

With this approximation, we have

g(x) = 1 +

.

where g0 is a constant of integration allowing to ﬁx the value of the potential at a particular

point. Equation (26), obtained at the same classical limit, implies that the acceleration is

constant and equal to −A. In this case, the potential is φ(x) = A x (a constant φ0 can be

absorbed into the constant g0), and Eq. (26) gives

The constant is ﬁxed at g0 = 1, in order that the metric is a Minkowski metric at the level

of the accelerated observer (x = 0).

In the general case, the function g(x) is actually given by

g(x) =

.

The real metric and the metric at the classical limit coincide when x ≪ c2/A, that is to say

for small accelerations or for short distances from the accelerated observer, as expected.

To conclude let us show with a realistic example that a gravitational ﬁeld is locally

equivalent to an acceleration ﬁeld. If an observer is far form a source of gravitation and

travels only on short distances, he can consider the gravitational ﬁeld as uniform and can

deﬁne a constant γ which measures the value of the local acceleration. Let us consider the

Schwarzschild metric for a mass M with spherical symmetry, located at the origin. In the

15

usual spherical coordinates, it is written

− r2(dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2),

(55)

where G is the universal gravitational constant. For an observer at rest (dr = dθ = dφ = 0)

located at altitude r, the interval of proper time dτ is related to an interval of coordinate

Let us assume that this observer is located at a great distance R from the origin
(2 G M/(c2R) ≪ 1). He can deﬁne a local constant value γ of the acceleration by the

time dt by

standard formula

dτ 2 =

(cid:19)

γ =

R2 .

Moreover, this observer makes experiments only for values of r close to R. Thus, he considers

values of r = R + x with x ≪ R. Using Eq. (56) and Eq. (57), he can ﬁnd the relation

between an interval of proper time dτ (R + x) at altitude R + x and an interval of proper

time dτ (R) at altitude R

dτ 2(R + x) =

(cid:18)

Since 2 γ R/c2 ≪ 1 and x ≪ R, the ﬁrst order expansion of formula (58) gives

dτ 2(R + x) ≈

1 +

dτ 2(R).

2 γ x
c2

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

Let us now look at the case of an observer with a constant proper acceleration. The

formula (16) gives the interval of proper time dτ (x) at altitude x as a function of an interval

of proper time dt at altitude x = 0. For small values of x or for weak acceleration A, this

formula can be written

dτ 2(x) ≈

1 +

dτ 2(0).

2 A x

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

This relation is formally identical to relation (59). Locally, the two metrics, the one for the

gravitational ﬁeld and the one for the acceleration ﬁeld, cannot be discriminated.

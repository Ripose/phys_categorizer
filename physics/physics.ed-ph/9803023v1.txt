Abstract

If potential energy is the timelike component of a four-vector, then there
must be a corresponding spacelike part which would logically be called the
potential momentum. The potential four-momentum consisting of the poten-
tial momentum and the potential energy taken together, is just the gauge
ﬁeld of the associated force times the charge associated with that force. The
canonical momentum is the sum of the ordinary and potential momenta.

Refraction of matter waves by a discontinuity in a gauge ﬁeld can be used
to explore the eﬀects of gauge ﬁelds at an elementary level. Using this tool
it is possible to show how the Lorentz force law of electromagnetism follows
from gauge theory. The resulting arguments are accessible to students at the
level of the introductory calculus-based physics course and tie together classi-
cal and quantum mechanics, relativity, gauge theory, and electromagnetism.
The resulting economy of presentation makes it easier to include modern
physics in the one year course normally available for teaching introductory
physics.

1 Introduction

Many physicists believe that it is important to introduce more modern physics to stu-
dents in the introductory college physics course.
(See, for instance, the summary of
the IUPP project by Coleman et al.
[1].) Our experience indicates that retaining the
conventional course structure and tacking modern physics on at the end almost guaran-
tees failure in this endeavor, due to the time constraints of the typical one year course.
Completely restructuring the course has been tried (see, for instance, Amato [2], Mills

1

[3], Moore [4], Weinberg [5]) and some form of this approach may be the most eﬀective
way to accomplish the desired goal.

Raymond and Blyth [6] brieﬂy outlined eﬀorts to develop an introductory college
physics course with a radically modern perspective. The ﬁrst semester of this two
semester course begins with optics and waves, proceeds from there to relativistic kine-
matics, and then introduces the basic ideas of quantum mechanics. It ﬁnishes with the
development of classical mechanics as the geometrical optics limit of quantum mechan-
ics. The second semester builds on the results of the ﬁrst semester and covers more
mechanics, electromagnetism, a survey of the standard model, and statistical physics.

The structure of this course was inspired by the Nobel Prize address of Louis de
Broglie [7]. The logic which led de Broglie to the relation between momentum and
wavenumber makes use of a beautiful application of the principle of relativity to obtain
the relativistic dispersion relation for waves representing massive particles. Furthermore,
de Broglie largely anticipated the development of the Schr¨odinger equation via an anal-
ogy between the propagation of light through a medium of varying refractive index and
the propagation of matter waves in a region of spatially variable potential energy.

De Broglie’s approach to matter waves subject to a potential suggests a way of getting
these ideas across in elementary form to beginning physics students. We believe that the
use of the Schr¨odinger equation per se is inappropriate at the level of an introductory
physics course. However, much of the physics of this equation can be extracted from its
dispersion relation in the case where the potential energy is piecewise constant.

The dispersion relation for free matter waves was obtained by de Broglie from little
more than the notion of relativistic invariance. Relativity also helps in the development
of a modiﬁed dispersion relation for matter waves subject to external inﬂuences, since the
modiﬁed as well as the original relation must satisfy relativistic invariance. There turn
out to be only a few possible invariant ways to make this modiﬁcation — gauge theory
results from one of these. Pursuit of this choice leads inevitably to the Lorentz force law
of electromagnetism. Use of Coulomb’s law and variations on the relativistic invariance
arguments of Purcell [9] and Schwartz [10] lead to most of the rest of electromagnetism.
The key arguments in this path involve the derivation and use of variations on Snell’s
law to show how wave packets change their velocity when they cross a discontinuity in a
gauge ﬁeld. These arguments invoke the same physics that appears in the application of
Hamilton’s principle to the generation of the equations of mechanics, albeit on a much
more elementary level. This connection becomes evident when it is realized that Snell’s
law contains the same physics as Fermat’s principle, which in turn is an application of
the principle of least action.

The above comments explain why we initially study waves and relativity in the in-
troductory course. Mastery of these topics allows even beginning students to obtain
at least some insight into the most subtle and profound ideas of physics, insight which
can only be acquired via the traditional path after many years of hard work. In addi-
tion, it points to an alternative approach to electromagnetism at the introductory level
which may actually be easier for beginning students to understand than the traditional

2

approach and is undoubtedly more economical of student time and eﬀort.

2 Potential Momentum

De Broglie treated particles in a potential by developing a formula for the index of
refraction n such that wave packets of light would act like such particles. The problem of
computing the evolution of matter waves was then reduced to the problem of computing
the propagation of light through a medium with variable refractive index. Pursuit of
this program leads to the Schr¨odinger equation.

A great deal can be learned about the propagation of light through a spatially variable
medium by examining the case of piece-wise constant index of refraction. In a region
in which n(k) is independent of position, wave packets of light move according to the
group velocity computed from the dispersion relation ω = c|k|/n, where ω is the angular
frequency of the light, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and k is its wave vector. A
wave packet crossing a discontinuity in n is treatable as a problem in refraction.

De Broglie concentrated on the non-relativistic limit in his discussion of the interac-
tion of waves with a potential. However, in some ways the relativistic case is simpler,
because any modiﬁcation to the free particle dispersion relation for relativistic matter
waves must also be relativistically invariant. The dispersion relation for free relativistic
particles of mass m is

2
ω2 − k2c2 = m2c4/¯h

2
k · k = −m2c2/¯h

where ¯h is Planck’s constant divided by 2π. We write this in the notation of the intro-
ductory course as

where k = (k, ω/c) is the wave four-vector with the wave vector k being the spacelike
part and ω/c the timelike part of k. (We ﬁnd it advantageous to use Weinberg’s choice
of metric [11], k · k = k· k − ω2/c2, because the four-vector dot product becomes a simple
extension of the ordinary dot product with one additional term.)

One can imagine only a few ways to modify equation (2) so as to maintain relativistic

invariance:

• One could write

where A is a relativistic scalar.

• An alternative would be

2
k · k = −(m − A)2c2/¯h

2
(k − A) · (k − B) = −m2c2/¯h

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where A and B are four-vectors. Weak, strong, and electromagnetic gauge theories
correspond to the case A = B.

3

• The ﬁnal apparent possibility is

2
k · N · k = −m2c2/¯h

where N is a tensor which becomes the identity tensor of spacetime in the free
particle case.

In the introductory course we state that

2
(k − T ) · (k − T ) = −m2c2/¯h

is the correct choice for all natural forces except gravity. However, we also explore the
consequences of a scalar potential ﬁeld. (The tensor potential is too complex to consider
in an introductory course!)

The four-vector gauge ﬁeld T has the form T = (T, S/c) so that the dispersion

relation for matter waves under the inﬂuence of a constant gauge ﬁeld expands to

2
Multiplying this equation by ¯h
for particles interacting with a constant gauge ﬁeld,

leads to the relativistic energy-momentum relationship

2
(ω − S)2 − |k − T|2c2 = m2c4/¯h

.

(E − U)2 − |Π − Q|2c2 = m2c4,

where Q ≡ ¯hT = (Q, U/c). E = ¯hω is the total energy and Π = ¯hk is the canonical
momentum [8]. However, we refer to it as the total momentum in the introductory
course in analogy with the total energy. The quantity U is just the potential energy.

We call the new quantity Q the potential momentum. This terminology arose in a
natural way during the ﬁrst iteration of the introductory course. We had discussed the
fact that momentum and kinetic energy together form a four-vector. I then pointed out
that potential energy is a quantity much like kinetic energy and asked the class what
this implied. A particularly bright freshman replied “. . . groan, potential momentum!”.

3 Group Velocity and Refraction of Matter Waves

In the introductory class it is necessary at this point to teach the students about partial
derivatives, since they typically have not yet covered this concept in their calculus course.
However, this is a relatively easy idea to get across. It is also necessary to extend the
idea of group velocity (about which they have learned earlier in the section on optics) to
more than one dimension. Thus, for instance, in two dimensions we have ω = ω(kx, ky)
and the group velocity is

sions. The vector T is perpendicular to the wave vector k in this case.

At this stage we ﬁnd it best to state the above result without proof as a plausible
extension of the one-dimensional result.

Given equation (9) it is easy to show that the group velocity of a quantum mechanical

wave is just

ug =

(k − T)c2
ω − S

=

(Π − Q)c2
E − U

.

(10)

This reduces to the usual expression for the group velocity of relativistic matter waves
when Q and U are zero.

An example of the motion of a wave packet is illustrated in ﬁgure 1, which shows
the student that wave packets don’t necessarily move in the direction of the wave vector
when T 6= 0.

Eliminating E − U and then |Π − Q| between equations (8) and (10) yields general-

izations of the usual formulas for the relativistic momentum and energy,

Π = Q + mugγ

(11)

where γ = (1 − u2
kinetic momentum just as mu2

(12)
g/c2)−1/2. We call the ordinary relativistic momentum p ≡ mugγ the

E = U + mc2γ

g/2 = E − U = K is the kinetic energy.

Figure 2 shows refraction by a discontinuity in a gauge ﬁeld. The frequency, ω, and
the component of the wave vector parallel to the interface, ky, are constant across the
interface as a result of phase continuity. This implies that E and Πy are continuous as
g/(2c2), and these conditions reduce to the
well. In the non-relativistic limit γ ≈ 1 + u2
continuity of U + mu2

g/2 and Qy + mugy across the interface.

4 Gauge Forces, Non-Relativistic Limit

The above expressions are suﬃcient to infer the accelerations of a particle in the non-
relativistic geometrical optics limit, and therefore the forces acting on it. Let us ﬁrst set
Q = 0 and approximate continuous variability in U along the x axis by a sequence of
slabs of constant U as shown in ﬁgure 3. In this case U + mu2
g/2 and ugy are constant.
Thus, the x and y components of the force are

In this case the force is the familiar negative gradient of the potential energy.

Next we set U = 0 and assume that Q = (0, Q, 0), with Q varying as shown in ﬁgure

The general case is not proved in the introductory class, but is presented as a plausible
generalization of equation (17).

So far we have assumed that the gauge ﬁelds aﬀecting particles are constant in time.
An interesting eﬀect occurs when a vector gauge ﬁeld varies with time. Figure 5 shows
how we attack this problem. According to the principle of relativity, the case of a particle
moving in the +x direction through a region in which Q is steady with time but increases
in magnitude with x is equivalent to the case of a stationary particle in which Q at the
particle increases with time. As ﬁgure 5 shows, this is because in the latter situation the
whole pattern of Q shifts to the left with time, resulting in the particle being exposed
to larger and larger values of Q. (We emphasize to our classes that it is important to
think of the ﬁeld pattern as shifting, not the ﬁeld itself. Fields don’t move, they just
have space and time variations which look diﬀerent in diﬀerent reference frames.) The
time rate of change of Q at the position of the particle in the right panel of ﬁgure 5 is

(20)

Equation (17) applies to the left panel of ﬁgure 5 with ugx = v, ugy = 0 and Q =
(0, Q, 0). The resulting force on the object is F = −v(∂Q/∂x). However, by the principle
of relativity, the force on the object in the right panel should be the same. (We are
assuming low velocity transformations, so the issue of F possibly changing as a result of

the transformation doesn’t arise here.) We therefore infer that the force on a stationary
particle with time-varying Q is

F = −

Putting all these eﬀects together, the complete gauge force is thus written

in the non-relativistic case, which is recognizable as being only a step away from the
Lorentz force law for electromagnetism. If the charge on the particle is q, then the scalar
potential is φ = U/q, the vector potential is A = Q/q, the electric ﬁeld E is the ﬁrst
two terms on the right side of the above equation divided by q, and the magnetic ﬁeld
is B = P/q. Thus, using only elementary arguments, the Lorentz force is shown to be a
consequence of the gauge theory assumption, which in turn arises from the assumption
of a potential momentum.

5 Electromagnetism

Purcell [9] and Schwartz [10] infer the character of electromagnetic ﬁelds from moving
charges by performing a Lorentz transformation on conﬁgurations of stationary charges.
This trick becomes considerably easier when attention is focused on the four-potential
a = (A, φ/c) rather than on the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, because the transformation
properties of the four-potential are much simpler.

Figure 6 illustrates the idea. The four-potential in this ﬁgure points along the ct′
axis and has invariant length φ′/c. Since the primed reference frame moves to the
right at speed v, the components of the four-potential in the unprimed frame are a =

[(βγφ′/c)i, γφ′/c] where β = v/c, γ = (1 − β2)−1/2, and i is the unit vector in the x
direction.

Let us consider a line of charge along the x axis moving with the primed reference
frame. In this reference frame we deﬁne the linear charge density to be λ′ and ﬁnd by
the usual Gauss’s law techniques plus a simple integration that the scalar potential in
the primed frame is

6 Discussion

Some may question the heavy dependence on arguments based on relativity in the present
approach. However, our experience has been that relativity is avidly absorbed and un-

10

derstood even by average beginning students when presented in terms of spacetime
triangles and a “spacetime Pythagorean theorem” rather than in terms of the rather
more abstract Lorentz transformations. Four-vectors don’t seem to present any partic-
ular problems and arguments based on relativistic invariance seem to resonate with the
students. In this respect our experiences are similar to Moore’s [12].

Others may point out that our treatment of gauge theory leaves out the connection
between gauge invariance and the form of the Lagrangian. We confess to not having
ﬁgured out how to present this result in a way which makes sense to the average college
freshman. However, we do point out (in a problem set) that the form of the four-potential
leading to particular electric and magnetic ﬁelds is not unique. Furthermore, our ap-
proach makes non-classical phenomena such as the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect relatively easy
for beginning students to understand.

There are at least three major advantages to the presentation proposed here:

1. Certain aspects of gauge theory are touched upon in a way that makes sense to
a beginning student. This is desirable in that the nearly universal role of gauge
theory in representing the forces of nature is otherwise hard to describe in a non-
trivial way at an introductory level.

2. Our route is arguably a more compact and insightful way to approach electromag-
netism than the normal presentation. This is an important consideration given
the limited time typically available to the introductory course.

3. The mathematics used here is arguably simpler than is seen in typical presenta-
tions of the mechanics of conservative forces and electromagnetism. In particular,
though partial derivatives are introduced, the use of the line integral, a particularly
puzzling concept for beginning students, is completely avoided.

Our approach thus fosters the goal of presenting the most profound ideas of physics in
a manner that is as accessible as possible to beginning students.

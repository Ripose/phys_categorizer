Because of its apparent complexity, the discussion of Wigner rotation is usually reduced to the
study of Thomas precession, which is too speciﬁc a case to allow a deep understanding of boost
composition. However, by using simple arguments and linear algebra, the result for the Wigner
rotation is obtaines straightforwardly, leading to a formula written in a manageable form. The
result is exempliﬁed in the context of the aberration of light.

I. INTRODUCTION

One of the most puzzling phenomenon in Special Relativity is the composition of boosts. When one contemplates
the form of an arbitrary boost [1], it becomes clear that the expression for the composition of two generic boosts will
be very complicated. As is known, the composition of boosts does not result in a (diﬀerent) boost but in a Lorentz
transformation involving rotation (Wigner rotation [2]),Thomas precession being the example normally worked out in
the textbooks [1] , [3], [4], [5]. In this example, one is composing two boosts along mutually perpendicular directions;
for small velocities a second-order approximation allows to get a result that is appropriate to understand the precession
of the spin of an electron inside an atom.

Of course, the composition of two arbitrary boosts is also studied in the literature [6], [7], [8], but generally
the treatments are too involved to capture the Wigner rotation easily. Sometimes the papers are aimed at the
understanding of certain properties of the Lorentz group, instead of looking for a straightforward way to get the
Wigner rotation, leaving in the reader the impression that this topic is complicated, and cannot be comprehended
without an involved analysis. Moreover, the expressions are often diﬃcult to use in practice, and the concepts are
frequently hidden behind the abundance of mathematics. The composition of boost and the Wigner rotation are
therefore virtually absent from textbooks (save for the very speciﬁc case of Thomas precession). One is then left with
the impression that the subject is subtle and diﬃcult. Of course, this is true but not to the point of preventing its
treatment with simple mathematical tools.

In this paper the aim will be diﬀerent. Our prime interest is in the Wigner rotation; we choose the composition of
boost as a speciﬁc issue because some characteristics of boosts are highlighted particularly well, the power of linear
analysis is demonstrated at its best, and, of course, because it is interesting in itself. The mathematical tool that we
will use is simple linear algebra. After all, boosts are linear transformations. However, the key point is that boosts
are symmetric linear transformations. This simple property will allow us to eﬀortlessly compute the Wigner rotation
(see Eq.( 8) below). Moreover, the understanding of the reason that makes the boost symmetric will reveal some
simple, basic facts that are often passed over in textbook treatments. A second goal of this paper is to present simple
formulas to compute the Wigner rotation. Their simplicity does not reside in their explicit form; the ﬁnal result will

always be messy. However, we want to give equations that are operationally simple in order that the computation of
the Wigner rotation should be a simple “plug and play” procedure.

II. BOOST COMPOSITION

We will start by considering the composition of two boosts along mutually perpendicular directions. Before em-
barking upon calculation, one should be sure about what is looking for: one is wondering whether the composition is
equivalent to a single boost or not. There are various ways of understanding this topic, depending to a large degree
on the particular expertise and taste of the reader. For the moment we will content ourselves with a mathematical
explanation. In Section III, we will clarify the meaning of the Wigner rotation by a physical exemple concerning the
aberration of light.

One could give an answer to the question by starting from the fact that boosts are represented by symmetric
matrices. On the one hand one knows that a boost Bx along the x axis is actually represented by a symmetric matrix,
−1.
and on the other hand one could get a generic boost by performing an arbitrary spatial rotation: Bx
Since the rotations are orthogonal matrices, then a boost along an arbitrary direction is also represented by a symmetric
T (BT = B), whose form can be found in the literature [1]. This symmetry can also be regarded
matrix B =
as a reﬂection of the fact that boosts leave four independent directions in spacetime invariant: namely, i) they do not
modify the light-cones; on the light-cone there are two independent directions, belonging to light-rays travelling back
and forth along the boost direction, that remain invariant (see Appendix A); ii) in addition, the spacelike directions
that are perpendicular to the boost direction are also left unchanged (a further two independent directions). Then,
boosts have four independent real eigen(four)-vectors, and their representative matrices must be symmetric (i.e.,
diagonalizable). In contrast, a (spatial) rotation changes the directions belonging to the plane where it is performed.
Since the product of matrices representing boosts is non-symmetric (unless both boosts are parallel), then one can
answer that the composition of two boosts is not, in general, equivalent to a single boost. So we are compelled to
analyze the result of the composition of two boosts as being equivalent to the composition of a boost and a rotation.
Again the symmetry of boosts will allow us to identify the rotation in the result.

which is non-symmetric, as anticipated. Note that if one wants to speak about inertial systems, there are three of
them here: the initial system from which β1 is deﬁned, the second which is the result of applying the ﬁrst boost and
from which β2 is measured and the ﬁnal one obtained as a result of making the second boost. These systems are all
taken with their spatial axis parallel to the previous one. These considerations are not important in working out the

y plane, is
orthogonal to the vector γ1β1 ˆx + β2 ˆy . Thus this last vector is in the direction of the boost Bf . In order to identify
the velocity of the boost Bf , one could consider the displacement four-vector between two events that happen at the
same place in the original coordinate system: ∆ = (∆τ, 0, 0, 0), ∆τ being the proper time. Since ∆
Bf ∆, then
in the boosted coordinate system the time interval between the events is γ2γ1∆τ . From the known relation between
proper time and coordinate time, one obtains the result that the gamma factor (in other words, the velocity) of the

In summary, the composition of a boost along the x axis with velocity β1 followed by a boost along the y axis with
1 β2 ˆy (the relativistic composition of velocities),

velocity β2 is equivalent to a single boost with velocity ~βf = β1 ˆx + γ−1

Equipped with the previous understanding of the composition of two perpendicular boosts, let us tackle the general
case. A generic composition of boosts can be seen as the composition of a boost B(a) of velocity ~βa, and a second
boost B of velocity ~β = ~βk + ~β⊥, where
mean the parallel and perpendicular directions with respect to the
ﬁrst boost ~βa. Since the Wigner rotation is a geometric result (it only depends on the velocities of the boosts and the
y plane as the plane deﬁned by both velocities, the x axis as the
angle between them), one is free to choose the x
direction
. Although a generic composition of boosts could demand formidable
algebraic manipulations, we will be able to get the result by using only the results of the previous section. The key to
attaining our goal will be the decomposition Eq. (14). In fact the main diﬃculty come from the fact that the second
boost has components ˆx and ˆy. Our ﬁrst step will consist in rewriting the second boost B as a composition of a boost
along ˆx and another boost along ˆy. This was done formally at the end of the preceeding section. We can thus use
Eq. (14) to regard the second boost B(~β = βk ˆx + β⊥ ˆy) as a product of a rotation and two mutually perpendicular
boosts, i.e.

, and the y axis as the direction

B(~β) = R−1 (φ) B(y)(β2 ˆy) B(x)(βk ˆx),

Alternatively, the velocity of a boost B(~β) can be straightforwardly read from the ﬁrst ﬁle of its matrix. Indeed, in order
that the time transformation adopts a form manifestly invariant under spatial rotations —ct′ = γ(ct − ~β · ~=r) —, the ﬁrst ﬁle
must be (γ, −γ ~β).

At ﬁrst glance it would seem to the reader that we are going backward, descomposing the boost instead of composing
them. The advantage of doing this will become clear in a few lines. We can now turn to the composition of B(~β) and
B(a)(βa ˆx):

B(~β) B(a)(βa ˆx) = R−1 (φ) B(y)(β2 ˆy) B(x)(βk ˆx) B(a)(βa ˆx) = R−1 (φ) B(y)(β2 ˆy) = B(x)(β1 ˆx),

where

which means

β1 =

βk + βa
1 + βkβa

denotes the velocity corresponding to the composition of two parallel boosts (then γ1 = γkγa(1 + βkβa)). Note that
we combined the two consecutive boost in the ˆx direction using the well known velocity addition formula. In this way
one falls back to the composition of the two remaining mutually perpendicular boosts. At this point, let us recall our
objective: we want to regard the composition B(~β) B(a)(βa ˆx) as the product of a rotation R (θW ) in the x
y plane
and a boost Bf . Then

−

R (θW ) Bf = B(~β) B(a)(βa ˆx) = R−1 (φ) B(y)(β2 ˆy) B(x)(β1 ˆx),

R (θW + φ) Bf = B(y)(β2 ˆy) = B(x)(β1 ˆx).

The good new is that we have already solved this expression in the previous section! The matrix Bf is that of
(10) with the velocities of (16) and (19). As shown there, Bf is a boost whose velocity ~βf comes from the relativistic
composition of the velocities β1 ˆx and β2 ˆy :

~βf = β1 ˆx + γ−1

i.e. ~βf is the relativistic composition of ~βa and ~β. The angle (θW + φ) in Eq.(21) must satisfy the (8):

III. ABERRATION OF LIGHT

We will show an application of Wigner rotation in the context of the aberration of light (i.e., the change of
the propagation direction of a light-ray produced by a boost). For simplicity we shall work with two mutually
perpendicular boosts. Let us choose the x axis to coincide with the propagation direction of the light-ray. A ﬁrst boost
B(x)(β1) leaves the propagation direction invariant, while a second boost B(y)(β2) changes that direction according
with the aberration of zenithal starlight law:

δc = arccos γ−1

2

δc is the angle between the x direction in the original coordinate system (the light-ray) and the x direction after
the composition. This is not the aberration angle due to a boost with the relativistically composed velocity ~βf =
β1 ˆx + γ−1

1 β2 ˆy . The Wigner rotation provides the diﬀerence between these two angles.
In fact, in Appendix 2 the aberration angle for a boost with velocity ~βf = β1 ˆx + γ−1

1 β2 ˆy has been computed; the

result is

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Our argument for working out the Wigner rotation can then be given in a nutshell as follows. First, a boost along
the x direction is manifestly symmetric. One can also understand this feature by noting that there are two null
eigenvectors along the null cone (with eigenvalue equal to the Doppler shifts) and two trivial ones (along the y and
z axis). Now, since a generic boost is obtained by a rotation of the axis and R−1 = RT (that is R is orthogonal),
the matrix representing a generic boost stays symmetric (or, equivalently, it will preserve its four eigenvectors with
real eigenvalues). The symmetry allows us to easily compute the Wigner angle in the case of a composition of two
perpendicular boosts. Now in the generic case, the problem can be cast in a form identical to the previous one, after
carrying out a proper decomposition of the boosts into two mutually perpendicular directions. Thus the answer is
written without any diﬃcult algebraic computing.

Physically not intuitive due to the lack of any Galilean analogue, Wigner rotation has been relegated to some corner
of knowledge. Althought Wigner rotation is challenging both in terms of mathematical skill and physical intuition,
its computation is nonetheless within the reach of elementary analysis and it is an instructive way to apprehend the
subtlety inherent to the subject.

APPENDIX 1: Eigen-directions of a boost

This is evident when we look at the transformation in a Minkowski diagram: this amount to a rigid rotation of 45◦in
the counter-clockwise sense in space-time instead of the famous ”scissor-like” picture of the Lorentz transformation.
This can be traced to the fact that the proper Lorentz group is isomorphic to O(1, 3) instead of O(4).The matrix O
in Eq.(27) belongs to the group O(4).

APPENDIX 2: Computation of the aberration angle
To begin with, we will recall the aberration angle due to a boost B(x)(β). If the light-ray propagates in the direction
ˆn = (cos ψ, sin ψ, 0), the transformed direction ˆn′ is obtained by applying the usual Lorentz transformation to the
velocity ~u = cˆn, which transforms to ~u′ = cˆn′:

The aberration angle is

(cid:3)

In getting this result, the x axis was chosen in the direction of the boost because of practical reasons. But, of

course, the aberration angle depends only on the norm of ~β and the angle ψ between ~β and the light-ray.

Let us now study the problem proposed in the body of the text. Let there be a boost with velocity ~βf = β1 ˆx+γ−1

and a light-ray traveling along the x axis. Then, using the substitutions

in (32) (the minus sign is due to the fact that the angle ψ is measured in the counter-clockwise sense from ~βf to ˆn),
after some algebra one obtains:

i.e. in the boosted system the angle between the light-ray (the x direction in the original coordinate system) and the
boost direction is ψ′ = ψ + δ.

The result (33) can be compared with that corresponding to the boost composition B(y) (β2) B(x) (β1). The ﬁrst
boost does not produce aberration, since it has the same direction as the light-ray. The second produces an aberration
that is a particular case of (33) with β1 = 0 :

cos δc = γ−1

Of course the same result is recovered from (32) by replacing β = β2 and ψ = π/2.

Brownian Motion: Theory and Experiment
A simple classroom measurement of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient

Kasturi Basu 1 and Kopinjol Baishya 2

Abstract

Brownian motion is the perpetual irregular motion exhibited by small particles immersed
in a ﬂuid. Such random motion of the particles is produced by statistical ﬂuctuations in
the collisions they suﬀer with the molecules of the surrounding ﬂuid. Brownian motion of
particles in a ﬂuid (like milk particles in water) can be observed under a microscope. Here
we describe a simple experimental set-up to observe Brownian motion and a method of
determining the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the Brownian particles, based on a theory due to
Smoluchowski. While looking through the microscope we focus attention on a ﬁxed small
volume, and record the number of particles that are trapped in that volume, at regular
intervals of time. This gives us a time-series data, which is enough to determine the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of the particles to a good degree of accuracy.

1 Description of the experiment

As our system we took water containing a small number of milk particles. From our experience we
found that freshly boiled and cooled milk, free from cream works well. A dilution of approximately
1 drop of milk in 10 drops of water was used since this was found to be suitable for our observations.
Observations were made with a microscope (the one we used had 15x eye-piece and 45x objective).
The solution was placed between two pieces of transparencies (sealed oﬀ at the edges to prevent
convection currents which, if not driven oﬀ, can drive things crazy) [See Fig.1]. One could see
Brownian motion of the milk particles if one looked at them carefully for long enough. However
the motion is not as vigorous or spectacular as we are used to seeing in textbook pictures.

If we focus attention on a single particle, it is expected that the particle will trace a random
path [as in Fig. 2]. Supposing that in time t the particle is displaced from the origin to the
position r. Then, for a Brownian particle the mean square displacement is given by < r2 >= 2Dt
and this deﬁnes the diﬀusion constant of the particle in the given ﬂuid. A straightforward way
of measuring the diﬀusion constant D would thus be to make a large number of observations on

the displacement of the particle in a given time t and ﬁnd the mean square displacement. In our
experiment however D turns out to be very small and so this method is not particularly easy.
Hence we use a diﬀerent method in which we estimate the diﬀusion constant in a rather indirect
manner. We shall describe the theory behind this method in successive sections.

We counted the number of particles contained in a well-deﬁned square area in the ﬁeld of
view of the microscope at constant intervals of time. We did it 30 seconds apart and made 130
observations. For this purpose a ﬁne grid was made on a small piece of transparency sheet, by
etching with a sharp edge, and attached to the eyepiece. The area actually enclosed by the grid
was calibrated with a standard grid ( we took one that is used in pathological laboratories for
counting blood corpuscles). The time-series data (time versus number of particles) thus obtained
has information on both static properties, such as the distribution of number of particles in the
observed area, and also dynamic properties such as the diﬀusion constant. We ﬁrst look at the
static properties and then go on to the problem of extracting the diﬀusion constant.

2 Number distribution: The Poisson distribution

We plotted the distribution of the frequency W (n) with which diﬀerent numbers of particles n
are observed within the marked region and compared it with the Poisson distribution that we
expect on the basis of the theory which we shall brieﬂy describe now. We consider a well-deﬁned
small element of volume v in a much larger volume V containing a large number of Brownian
particles under conditions of diﬀusion equilibrium [See ﬁg.3]. The number of particles contained
in v ﬂuctuates with time.

Now, if we count the number of particles contained in v at constant intervals of time τ apart,
then the frequency W (n) with which diﬀerent numbers n of particles are counted will follow the
Poisson distribution:

W (n) =

e−ννn
n!

(1)

where ν denotes the average number of particles contained in v.

That the distribution will indeed have the form (1) can be proven, provided the following

assumptions are held true in the given system:

(i) the particles do not interfere with each other, and
(ii) they are equally likely to be anywhere within the system.

Surely, for our system of Brownian particles these two assumptions are really good ones.
In Fig. 4 we show comparison of our experimental data with the Poisson Distribution, and

ﬁnd that they match pretty well, so as to justify the assumptions above.

We would like to discuss something more before we come down to tackling the problem at hand,
that of determining the diﬀusion coeﬃcient from the time-series data obtained from observation.

3 The Brownian particle as a random walker

Each Brownian particle in a ﬂuid is being kicked by ﬂuid molecules randomly, i.e. from all sides
with equal probability. A Brownian particle can, hence, satisfactorily be modeled as a random
walker, i.e. a walker who moves in successive steps, each step being independent of the previous
step.

In the experiment we perform, we are essentially looking at Brownian motion in 2-dimensions
(with the ﬁeld of view of the microscope constituting the xy-plane). So now we consider a
random walker in 2-dimensions. Let’s look at the discrete case ﬁrst. The random walker is
moving on a 2-dimensional lattice, and can move up, down, right or left with equal probabilities.
We assume steps of equal size a, the time for each step being τ . Then if at some time t the
walker is at the point r = (x, y), then at time t + τ it can be at either of the four points
(x + a, y), (x
a). The probability of it being at any of these four points
is 1/4. Let Q(r, t) be the probability for the walker to be at the point r at time t. Then,

initially the particle is located at the origin) using
Fourier transforms, we get

Thus, coming back to our system we conclude that the probability of occurrence of a Brownian

4 Extraction of diﬀusion coeﬃcient from the time-series

data

We begin by deﬁning the probability P that a particle somewhere inside v will have come out of it
during the time τ . (N.B. As mentioned in section 3. we are into a 2-dimensional problem. Here
we are no longer considering v as the 3-dimensional small volume, but rather as its projection
onto the xy-plane. The symbol v mentioned henceforth is the 2-dimensional area we are focusing
on and taking snapshots of).

where the integration over r1 is extended over all points in the interior of v while that over r2 is
extended over all points exterior to v.

where, now, the integration over both r1 and r2 are extended over all points inside v. (Physically,
P is the probability that a particle somewhere inside v will have still remained within v after
1
a time τ .)

Now, if we take v to be a square area of side h (which can easily be ensured by using a square

The α in Eq.(8) contains D, vide Eq.(7). Thus Eq.(8) relates P with D.

The next question, which arises naturally, is how to ﬁnd P from the experimental time-series
data. We now show how this can be obtained from the mean square ﬂuctuation in the diﬀerence
iav. We will need to use

the Poisson distribution discussed in section 1.

5 Determining P experimentally

Let τ be the experimental time interval between successive observations. Let x be the number of
particles that remain in the volume v after time τ , having started with n particles within v.

Let y be the number of particles that enter the volume v in time τ . Obviously y is independent

of n, the initial number of particles within v, vide assumption (i).

We deﬁne the probability that i particles leave volume v in time τ , having started with n
, the probability that x particles remain in volume v after time τ , starting with
x , and the probability that y particles enter volume v in time τ as Ey.

particles as A(n)
i
n particles within v as B(n)

We have, with reference to the probability P deﬁned at the beginning of section 4,

A(n)

i =

P i (1

P )n−i,

i!(n

i)!

n!

which is a Bernoulli distribution.

Now, our system is under equilibrium conditions and there is no net inward or outward ﬂux of
particles from volume v, i.e. the a priori probabilities for the entrance and emergence of particles
from the volume v are equal. So Ey will be the same as the probability that y particles emerge
from the volume v in time τ in general, i.e. starting with any value of n (the distribution of n
satisﬁes the Poisson distribution (1) ). i.e.,

From eqs. (1), (9) and (10), we eventually have

which is again a Poisson distribution. Also, we have, similar to (9),

From equations (12) and (11) we may calculate the mean and mean square deviations of x

Now, let us consider a situation in which we count n particles within the volume v in one snapshot
and then ﬁnd m particles in v in the next snapshot (i.e., after time τ ). If T (n, m) is the probability
of such a transition, evidently,

T (n, m) =

easily be calculated from the experimental time-series data. Thus eq. (17) tells us how to ﬁnd
P experimentally. Finally, using eqs. (8) we can determine the diﬀusion coeﬃcient from the
experimental time series data.

6 Experimental results

10−12m2.s−1.
For our experiment, P turned out as 0.326, and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D as 2.1
This is almost ten times greater than the rough theoretical estimate using Einstein’s formula
[Ref. Box 1]. Given the simplicity and lack of sophistication of the experimental setup, this is a
reasonable estimate. For obtaining better accuracy, a camera could be ﬁtted to the eye-piece of
the microscope in order to take snapshots at regular intervals instead of the manual procedure we
have used. This would lead to more accurate data collection and also much more number of data
points (we took only 130 data points). A vibration-free and tilt-free working table could also be
used to reduce external disturbances. Finally the milk particles used in the experiment were not
monodisperse, that is there was quite some variation in the sizes of particles. Using monodisperse
particles would clearly be an improvement.

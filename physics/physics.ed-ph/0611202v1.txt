Gubarev, Stodolsky, and Zakharov1 have noted the following identity for vector ﬁelds

that vanish suﬃciently rapidly at spatial inﬁnity,

and used it to investigate properties of the vector potential in quantum ﬁeld theory. Stewart2

has shown that the identity is also of general interest in classical electromagnetic theory.

It can be used, for example, to derive easily interpreted expressions for the energies in

time-dependent electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

The existence of this identity is not obvious. In Ref. 1 it is not proven, but it is noted
that it follows from the momentum-space relation (k × ˜A)2 = k2 ˜A2 − (k · ˜A)2 where ˜A(k) is

the Fourier transform of the vector ﬁeld. The position-space derivation given by Stewart is

based on the Helmholtz decomposition of a three-dimensional vector ﬁeld into irrotational

and solenoidal parts. We give here an alternative position-space derivation that uses only

familiar operations starting from the relations

for the Dirac delta function, and

δ3(x − x′) = −

∇ × (∇ × A) = ∇(∇ · A) − ∇2A.

Both are familiar to students and are used in the solution of Poisson’s equation for the

potential of a point charge and the derivation of the wave equation from Maxwell’s equations.

By using Eq. (2), we obtain

d3xA(x) · A(x) =

d3x d3x′A(x) · δ3(x − x′)A(x′)

If we integrate by parts over x′ and use the assumed rapid vanishing of A(x′) for |x′| → ∞,
we can transfer the action of the derivatives from the factor 1/|x − x′| to A(x′) without

acquiring extra surface terms. We use the identity (3) for the double curl, make another

Now ∇′(1/|x − x′|) = −∇(1/|x − x′|), so with some rearrangement of the vector products,

Eq. (5b) becomes

A ﬁnal partial integration with respect to x gives the desired identity.

The derivation generalizes easily to give an identity of the same form for the volume

integral of the product of two diﬀerent rapidly decreasing vector ﬁelds.

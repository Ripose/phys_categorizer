On vector potential of the Coulomb gauge

Valery P Dmitriyev
Lomonosov University, P.O. Box 160, Moscow 117574, Russia∗

The question of an instantaneous action (A M Stewart 2003 Eur. J. Phys. 24 519)

can be approached in a systematic way applying the Helmhotz vector decomposition

theorem to a two-parameter Lorenz-like gauge. We thus show that only the scalar

potential may act instantaneously.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The role of the gauge condition in classical electrodynamics was recently highlighted [1].

This is because of probable asymmetry between diﬀerent gauges. The distinct feature of the

Coulomb gauge is that it implies an instantaneous action of the scalar potential [2, 3, 4]. The

question of simultaneous co-existence of instantaneous and retarded interactions is mostly

debated [5]. The paper [2] concludes that ‘the vector decomposition theorem of Helmholtz

leads to a form of the vector potential of the Coulomb gauge that, like the scalar potential,

is instantaneous’. This conclusion was arrived at considering the retarded integrals for

electrodynamic potentials. Constructing within the same theorem wave equations the author

[3] ﬁnds that ‘the scalar potential propagates at inﬁnite speed while the vector potential

propagates at speed c in free space’. In order to resolve the discrepancy between [2] and [3]

the latter technics will be developed below in a more systematic way.

Recently the two-parameter generalization of the Lorenz gauge was considered [1, 4]:

∇ · A +

c
c2
g

∂ϕ
∂t

= 0 ,

(1)

where cg is a constant that may diﬀer from c . We will construct wave equations applying

the vector decomposition theorem to Maxwell’s equations with (1). Thus simultaneous

co-existence of instantaneous and retarded actions will be substantiated.

II. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS IN THE KELVIN-HELMHOLTZ

REPRESENTATION

Maxwell’s equations in terms of electromagnetic potentials A and ϕ read as

∂A

+ E + ∇ϕ = 0

− c∇ × (∇ × A) + 4πj = 0

∂E
∂t

∇ · E = 4πρ .

The Helmholtz theorem says that a vector ﬁeld u that vanishes at inﬁnity can be expanded

into a sum of its solenoidal ur and irrotational ug components. We have for the electric

ﬁeld:

where

where

E = Er + Eg ,

∇ · Er = 0

∇ × Eg = 0 .

A = Ar +

∇ · Ar = 0

The similar expansion for the vector potential can be written as

If we substitute Eqs. (5) and (8) into Eq. (2), we obtain

By taking the curl of Eq. (11), we obtain using Eqs. (7) and (10)

On the other hand, from Eqs. (6) and (9), we have

If the divergence and curl of a ﬁeld are zero everywhere, then that ﬁeld must vanish. Hence,

Eqs. (12) and (13) imply that

We subtract Eq. (14) from Eq. (11) and obtain

Similarly, if we express the current density as

Eq. (3) can be written as two equations

From Eqs. (5) and (6), Eq. (4) can be expressed as

∇ · Eg = 4πρ .

III. WAVE EQUATIONS FOR THE TWO-SPEED EXTENSION OF

ELECTRODYNAMICS

We will derive from Eqs. (14), (15), (19), (20), and (21) the wave equations for the

solenoidal (transverse) and irrotational (longitudinal) components of the ﬁelds.

In what

follows we will use the general vector relation

The wave equation for Ar can now be found. We diﬀerentiate Eq. (14) with respect to time:

∇(∇ · u) = ∇2u + ∇ × (∇ × u) .

We next substitute Eq. (19) into Eq. (23) and use Eqs. (22) and (9) to obtain

∂2Ar
∂t2

− c2∇2Ar = 4πcjr .

The wave equation for Er can be found as follows. We diﬀerentiate Eq. (19) with respect

to time:

∂2Er
∂t2

− c∇ × (∇ ×

) + 4π

= 0 ,

∂Ar
∂t

∂jr
∂t

and substitute Eq. (14) into Eq. (25). By using Eqs. (22) and (9), we obtain

∂2Er
∂t2

− c2∇2Er = −4π

∂j r
∂t

.

In the absence of the electric current, Eqs. (24) and (26) are wave equations for the solenoidal

ﬁelds Ar and Er.

To ﬁnd wave equations for the irrotational ﬁelds, we need a gauge relation. Substituting

(8) into Eq. (1) we get the longitudinal gauge

The solenoidal part of the vector potential automatically satisﬁes the Coulomb gauge,

Eq. (9). The wave equation for Ag can be found as follows. We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate Eq. (15)

with respect to time:

We then take the gradient of Eq. (27),

and combine Eqs. (28), (29) and (20). If we use Eqs. (22) and (10), we obtain

Next, we will ﬁnd the wave equation for ϕ. We take the divergence of Eq. (15),

and combine Eqs. (31), (27), and (21):

Equations (32) and (30) give wave equations for ϕ and Ag.

We may try to ﬁnd a wave equation for Eg using Eq. (15) in Eqs. (32) and (30). However,

in the absence of the charge, we have from Eq. (21)

Hence, by Eqs. (33) and (7), we have

∇ · Eg = 0 .

Eg = 0 .

We see that Maxwell’s equations (2)–(4) with the longitudinal gauge (27) imply that the

solenoidal and irrotational components of the ﬁelds propagate with diﬀerent velocities. The

solenoidal components Ar and Er propagate with the speed c of light, and the irrotational

component Ag of the magnetic vector potential and the scalar potential ϕ propagate with

the speed cg.

IV. SINGLE-PARAMETER ELECTRODYNAMICS

In reality, electrodynamics has only one parameter, the speed of light, c. Then, to

construct from the above the classical theory, we have to choose among two variants: two

waves with equal speeds or a single wave. If we let

the two-parameter form (1) becomes the familiar Lorenz gauge

∇ · A +

c

∂ϕ
∂t

= 0 .

Another possible choice is

The condition (37) turns Eq. (1) into the Coulomb gauge

Substituting

cg = c,

cg ≫ c .

A = 0 .

cg = ∞

into the dynamic equation (32), we get

− ∇2ϕ = 4πρ .

Validity of Eq. (40) for the case when ϕ and ρ may be functions of time t means that the

scalar potential ϕ acts instantaneously.

Substituting (39) into Eq. (27) we get for the irrotational part of the vector potential:

∇ · Ag = 0 .

Ag = 0 .

jg = 0 .

Insofar as the divergence (41) and the curl (10) of Ag are vanishing, we have

So, on the ﬁrst sight by (39) irrotational component Ag of the vector potential propagates

instantaneously. However, according to relation (42), with (39) Ag vanishes.

Putting (42) into Eq. (30) we obtain as well

Putting (42) into (8) and (43) into (16) we get

Substituting (44) into Eq. (24) gives

A = Ar

and

j = jr .

∂2A
∂t2

− c2∇2A = 4πcj .

Eq. (45) indicates that in the Coulomb gauge (38) the vector potential A propagates at

speed c.

V. MECHANICAL INTERPRETATION

Recently, we have shown [6] that in the Coulomb gauge electrodynamics is isomorphic

to the elastic medium that is stiﬀ to compression yet liable to shear deformations. In this

analogy the vector potential corresponds to the velocity and the scalar potential to the

pressure of the medium. Clearly, in an incompressible medium there is no longitudinal

waves, the pressure acts instantaneously, and the transverse wave spreads at ﬁnite velocity.

This mechanical picture provides an intuitive support to the electrodynamic relations (38),

(40) and (45) just obtained.

VI. CONCLUSION

7

By using a two-parameter Lorenz-like gauge, we extended electrodynamics to a two-speed

theory. Turning the longitudinal speed parameter to inﬁnity we come to electrodynamics

in the Coulomb gauge. In this way we show that the scalar potential acts instantaneously

while the vector potential propagates at speed of light.

I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. I. P. Makarchenko for valuable comments

concerning the non-existence of longitudinal waves of the electric ﬁeld and longitudinal

waves in the Coulomb gauge.

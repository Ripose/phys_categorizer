Simple airtrack simulations, like those now possible with web-based interactive 3D environments,
can provide explorers of any age with experiential data suﬃcient to formulate their own models of
motion. In particular, with a compressable spring, two gliders, a moving clock and two gate pairs
with timers (pre and post collision), Newton’s laws (or one’s own version thereof) may emerge (or
be tested) in the lab. At high speeds, one might ﬁnd Minkowski’s spacetime version of Pythagoras’
theorem (the metric equation) in the data, along with “anyspeed” expressions for momentum and
kinetic energy.

INTRODUCTION

Modeling workshop[1, 2] is a popular way to confront
students with predictive challenges imposed by nature,
and thereby allow them to discover their own (as well
as conventional) strategies for meeting those challenges.
Such “hands on” approaches require ﬁrst person experi-
ence with the phenomenon of interest if at all possible.
This is preferable in part because direct experience with
nature is less dependent upon (i.e.
is less mediated by)
our choice of concepts for representing nature, than for
example are: (i) tales about the experience of others, or
(ii) conceptual explanations of how nature works. Thus
students can bring their own fresh eyes to the problem.
Of course, there are many “extreme physics” phenom-
ena which are diﬃcult, expensive, dangerous, or impos-
sible to give students ﬁrst hand access to. Such phenom-
ena include relativistic speeds, nanoscale structures, ex-
treme space-time curvatures, wavefunction collapse, re-
ciprocal space, and quantum tunneling. For such phe-
nomena, “minimally mediated” experiences (sometimes
but not always requiring simulations) are increasingly
possible to arrange using virtual interfaces that require
no specialized skills on the part of students (e.g. only pat-
tern recognition and manipulative skills developed on the
playground, or while playing video games). Such expe-
riences can give students a visceral appreciation of these
phenomena, and perhaps also add motivation for acquir-
ing the conceptual background (e.g. courses in calculus)
likely required for a deeper understanding.

II. THE SIMULATION

Imagine the airtrack experiment illustrated in Fig 1.
Here a spring is compressed by distance x0, and on re-
lease allowed to transfer kinetic energy K0 to a glider.
The kinetic energy of the glider may be inferred from in-
formation on the spring’s mass, displacement, and spring
constant, or from information on the energy used to com-

press the spring. Although compression distance is easier
for introductory students to understand, use of kinetic
energy (hence the amount of work done compressing a
massless spring) as the independent variable is consis-
tent with trends in physics education to introduce con-
servation of energy (e.g.
It
is also consistent with the American Assocation for the
Advancement of Science benchmarks[4], which propose
energy as a “ major exception to the principle that stu-
dents should understand ideas before being given labels
for them”. The simulation works in either case.

[3]) as early as possible.

The time interval elapsed as this glider then crosses
gate-pair A is measured using lab-clocks (tA) and a
traveling-clock (τA). This ﬁrst glider then collides with,
and sticks to, a 2nd glider. The time interval elapsed
as the glider pair crosses gate-pair B is measured using
lab-clocks (tB), and the traveling clock on the ﬁrst glider
(τB). Choose conditions under which glider motion is
essentially frictionless.

The algorithms to run this simulation are relatively
easy to derive. However, the focus in this note is on
how students might get data from such experiments, and
what to do with it after the fact, not to hedge student
bets by providing equations before they have given the
data a chance to speak for itself.

III. GETTING DATA FROM THE SIMULATION

Sample data from this experiment, e.g. elapsed times
for various values of spring compression x0 or launch en-
ergy K0, are tabulated here. The simulation was done
twice, once with a rather ﬂexible spring (Table I), and the
other with an extremely tight spring resulting in much

separations (xA and xB) are 1 foot or 0.305 meters. The
data contain some measurement errors in the times, al-
though we’ve been careful to eliminate systematic errors,
and to keep the random variations in measurement of the
same time-interval at or about the 1 percent level.

Simulators with which the students can take data
themselves also exist, or can be written. We’ve devel-
oped a Visual Basic program which does this, and have
more recently implemented a 3D simulator on the web
using the beta-test version of Adobe’s proposed Atmo-
sphere environment server[5]. The web simulator allows
direct control (with a logarithmic slider) of the imparted
kinetic energy (or the work done to compress a mass-
less spring), rather than compression distance x0. The
Adobe implementation can also serve as a meeting place
for students, should they decide to take data as part of a
team eﬀort. A Java applet for this simulation might also

IV. DISCUSSION AFTER THE FACT

The data generated by the simulation provides clues to
natural rules of motion that are often explored in physics
courses. Rather than tell students what others (including
Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein) might have pro-
posed doing with such data, modeling workshop physics
traditionally asks students: “What patterns do you see
in the data”. One pattern at high speed that might be
uncovered is a curious fact about the sum of squares of
a traveler’s “speeds” through space (∆x/∆t) and time
(c∆τ /∆t), where c (lightspeed) is used to convert time
elapsed on the clock of a traveler (τ ) into distance units.
See if any students happen to uncover this fact from the
data itself.

A starting point for students is the classic modeling
workshop strategy of plotting the data in various ways, to
see if any simple (e.g straight line) relationships emerge.
Other questions to ask: In the case of the ﬂexible spring
data set, does the relationship between lab-times (t) be-
fore and after collision seem to make sense? How about
the relationship between kinetic energy or spring com-
pression, and the initial gate time tA? For the tight
spring, to these also add: What’s going on with the diﬀer-
ence between lab and glider time-intervals (e.g. between
tA and τA)?

What concepts might be useful for cashing in on the
insight from this experiment? Aristotle might have said
to pay attention to “motives” and speed. Galileo in
the 1500’s might have said to consider accelerations as
well[6]. Newton in the 1600’s might have suggested the
concept of momentum, and James Clerk Maxwell may
have suggested considering energy[7]. Einstein in 1906
might have agreed, but then stressed the importance of
specifying frame of reference when measuring positions
and times. More to the point: What relationships and
concepts does each student ﬁnd useful or informative? If
they can determine this, then they will be able to claim
as their very own as small part of our collective under-
standing of dynamics. This alone qualiﬁes them as par-
ticipants in the development of better ways to understand
such things downstream.

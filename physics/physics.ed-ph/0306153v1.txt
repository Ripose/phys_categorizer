The majority of current textbooks on device physics at the undergraduate level derive the diode equation
based on the diffusion of injected minority carriers. Generally the drift of the majority carriers, or the extent of
drift, is not discussed and the importance of drift in the presence of a ﬁeld in the neutral regions is almost totally
ignored. The assumptions of zero ﬁeld in the neutral regions and conduction by minority carrier diffusion lead
to a number of pedagogical problems and paradoxes for the student. The purpose of this paper is to address
the pedagogical problems and paradoxes apparent in the current treatment of conduction in the pn junction as it
appears in the majority of texts.

I.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

The pn junction theory forms an integral part all physical electronics courses. At both undergraduate and graduate levels, the
conventional analysis of the pn junction device under forward bias conditions follows closely Shockley’s original treatment [1]
in which the diode equation is derived based on the injection and diffusion of minority carriers. There are, however, a number
of paradoxes in the treatment of the subject matter in the present textbooks (see below) which tends to mislead the students.
Under zero and forward bias conditions, the pn junction displays a number of characteristic features with particular reference to
carrier concentrations, exposed ionized dopants in the space charge layer (SCL) or the depletion layer, internal ﬁeld, E(x) in the
SCL, and the built-in voltage V0. In a typical undergraduate course the arguments used in driving the diode equation follow a
sequence of simplifying assumptions:

(a) The depletion region or the SCL (space charge layer) has a much higher resistance than the neutral regions so that the

applied voltage drops across the depletion region. There is therefore no ﬁeld in the neutral regions.

(b) The applied forward bias reduces the built-in potential V0 and allows the diffusion and hence injection of minority carriers.
From assumption (a), the law of the junction gives the injected minority carrier concentration in terms of the applied voltage.
For example for holes injected into the n-side,

where pn(0) is the hole concentration just outside the depletion region, at the origin x=0, pn0 is the equilibrium hole concen-

tration in the n-region, pn0=n2

i /Nd, V is the applied bias, and the other symbols have their usual meanings.

(c) Since the electric ﬁeld in the neutral regions is assumed to be zero, the continuity equation for the minority carriers is
greatly simpliﬁed and becomes analytically tractable even at the junior undergraduate level. For holes in the n-region, under
steady state conditions, ∂pn/∂t=0 and the continuity equation is simply

where Jhn is the hole current density and τhn is the minority carrier (hole) recombination time both in the n-region. It is tacitly
assumed in eq.(2) that the minority carrier concentration is much less than the equilibrium majority carrier concentration so that
a constant minority carrier lifetime can be deﬁned which is independent of the majority carrier concentration, nn.
The hole current density however is simply the diffusion component as the electric ﬁeld is assumed to be zero,

where Dhn is the diffusion coefﬁcient of the minority carriers (holes) in the n-region.
Substituting eq. (3) into eq. (2), leads to

and solving eq.(4) for pn one obtains, for a long diode,

∆pn(x) = ∆pn(0)exp(

where ∆pn=pn-pn0 is the excess minority carrier concentration and x is measured from just outside the depletion region. The
long diode assumption means that the length of the neutral region, ln, is much greater than the minority carrier diffusion length,
Lhn, deﬁned as √Dhnτhn. The long diode assumption however is not necessary for the derivation of the diode equation; it
serves to simply the solution of eq.(4) to a single exponential rather than a hyperbolic sine function.
With the minority carrier concentration given as in eq.(5), from eq.(3) the hole current density is

There is obviously a similar minority carrier diffusion current density in the p-region for the injected electrons, i.e.

where Dep and Lep are the electron diffusion coefﬁcient and diffusion length, ∆np is the excess electrons concentration all in

the p-region, and x’ is distance measured away from the depletion region in the p-side.

(d) It is assumed that the depletion region is so narrow that the currents do not vary across this region. Then the majority
carrier current at x=0 is the same as the minority carrier current at x’=0. Similarly the majority carrier current at x’=0 is the same
as the minority carrier current at x=0. Thus the total current density is

and using the law of the junction for ∆pn(0) and ∆np(0) from eq.1 one obtains the diode equation,

This is the general diode equation found in the majority of textbooks which follow the above sequence of steps, either through

key assumptions in the derivation of equation (2) as discussed, for example, by Moloney [1].

Equation (2) gives the impression that the conduction process in the p+n junction diode is the diffusion of injected holes in the
n-region. The above steps invariably lead to a conclusion for the student that it is the minority carrier diffusion which constitutes
the forward current.

Close examination of the above steps in the derivation exposes a number of serious pedagogical paradoxes and problems for
the student and the instructor. The diode equation in eq. 11 is so entrenched in our teaching of the pn junction that it has been
used to design many simple but fruitful laboratory experiments as reported in various journals.

II. PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEMS

3

The conventional undergraduate level treatment in Section I leads to a number of pedagogical problems and paradoxes. We

cite those we have encountered frequently in two undergraduate classes during the treatment of the forward biased long diode:

(a) If there is no ﬁeld in the neutral region then there can be no net charge at any point in this region inasmuch as
dE/dx = 0. Then the excess majority carrier concentration should follow the decay of the excess minority carrier concen-
tration, ∆nn(x)=∆pn(x), which then follows eq. 5. But the gradients of ∆nn(x)=∆pn(x) along x must be the same as well.
Therefore majority carriers diffuse towards the right as well and since in silicon De > Dh, and electrons are negatively charged
the net current is actually in the reverse direction. The current must be in the opposite direction to the applied voltage!

(b) The minority carrier current, which is due to diffusion, decays with x. Since the total current must be constant, the majority
carrier current must increase with x. However, there is no ﬁeld in the neutral region which means that electrons must diffuse.
From the ﬁrst paradox above this diffusion can not make up for the decay in the hole current.

(c) Far away from the depletion region, both the hole and electron concentrations are almost uniform. If there is no electric
ﬁeld, then the current, due to diffusion, must vanish. How is it that the current stays constant in the neutral region (indeed in the
whole device)?

(d) The absence of an electric ﬁeld in the neutral region means that ∆nn(x)=∆pn(x). But when holes are injected into the

n-region they recombine with electrons so that , intuitively, the majority carrier concentration should decrease not increase.

The concept of ﬁeld free neutral regions is so deeply rooted in the present treatment that many authors do indeed show the
excess majority carrier concentration increasing towards the junction like the excess minority carrier concentration. This fact
alone is contrary to student intuition that, if anything, the excess majority concentration should remain uniform. It is clear that
the instructor has a responsibility to clear this paradox. It is interesting to note that a large number of authors sketch the carrier
concentration proﬁles with the majority carrier concentration shown as uniform whereas others show the excess majority carrier
proﬁle following the excess minority carrier concentration proﬁle as indicated in Table I for a survey of a large number of books
on the subject. The differences in the diagrams only add confusion to the student’s understanding. Few authors allude to the
presence of the electric ﬁeld and majority carrier drift to overcome some of the problems listed above. There is however no
satisfactory treatment in the majority of the textbooks used in English speaking countries we have examined as illustrated in
Table I. In most books the ﬁeld in the neutral region is totally neglected in the treatment. The result, we believe, is pedagogical
paradoxes and a student who is confused. It seems that only some of the early books published in the sixties consider the need
and the effects of the ﬁeld in the neutral regions in their discussion of conduction in the forward biased pn junction.

III. DIFFUSION OR DRIFT?

For simplicity we consider a long p+n junction diode. Equation (2) describes its conventional current-voltage characteristics.
We use the parameters listed in Table 2 which represent ”typical” parameters for a p+n junction Si diode albeit classroom
parameters. We also assume small injection so that pn0 << nn0 (or ND). The latter assumption means that the minority carrier
recombination time remains a useful parameter . For forward bias we take the voltage across the diode to be typically 0.55V. The
depletion region extends essentially into the n-side and its width W, is much shorter than the hole diffusion length in this region
as indicated in Table II. Similarly the relatively tiny extension of the depletion width into the p+region is much shorter than the
electron diffusion length there. Lengths of the neutral regions are taken to be about ten times their minority carrier diffusion
lengths to represent a ”long-diode”, i.e. ln=10Lh and lp=10Le.

(12)

The ﬁrst attempt to overcome the problems listed in Section II is to allow some of the applied voltage, a small fraction of it,
to drop across the neutral n-region of the p+-n junction. This is easily accepted by the student since the neutral regions must
have some ﬁnite resistance even though much smaller than the depletion region. This means that the law of the junction remains
approximately valid. What is the ﬁeld in the n-region?

The total current through the p+n junction must be continuous. This means that at any point in the n-region,

J =

eDhn

−

d∆pn
dx

d∆nn
dx

+ eµhnpnEn + eDen

+ eµennnEn = constant

(13)

where En is the ﬁeld in the n-region at x. Initially En is assumed to be small but ﬁnite.
Since nn >> pn , nn ≈

ND (small injection), and ∆nn(x)=∆pn(x) the above equation simpliﬁes to,

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

J = e(Den −

Dhn)

d∆pn
dx

+ eµenNDEn(x)

The requirement of an internal ﬁeld is quite transparent from eq. (3). The minority concentration gradient is negative and
Den > Dhn which means that the ﬁrst term in eq.(3) is negative so that current is in the negative direction. Unless there is an
internal ﬁeld drifting the majority carriers it is not possible to obtain a positive current.

The pedagogic development at this point must make use of the excess minority carrier concentration in eq.5. If the ﬁeld is
indeed sufﬁciently small it may be assumed that the excess minority carrier proﬁle, ∆pn(x), is still given by eq.5. The validity
of this assumption will be demonstrated below with an illustrative example. One can also assume that eq. (2) can still be used to
describe the total diode current. Then from eqs. 5, 2 and 3, one can obtain the ﬁeld En in the n-region

(cid:21)

where we have used the deﬁnition bn = µen/µhn=Den/Dhn(> 1). Equation (4) describes the ﬁeld outside the SCL in the
so-called neutral region that is needed to maintain the diode current. In the n-region the ﬁeld increases towards the SCL. The
increase in the ﬁeld is required to make up for the negative electron diffusion current. Far away from the depletion region the
current is maintained by a constant ﬁeld of magnitude,

An interesting feature is that the magnitude of the ﬁeld increases exponentially with the applied voltage contrary to student
intuition based on the applied voltage simply dividing between the resistance of the depletion region and the resistance of the
neutral region.

With the ﬁeld given in eq.15 a paradox mentioned in Section II develops in that E varies spatially across the neutral region so

that dE/dx is not zero. Gauss equation in point form (or the Poisson equation) in the n-region is:

Substituting typical values for ε, bn, ND, Lhn from Table II into eq.(2) shows that the second term is

6. Thus
∆nn(x)=∆pn(x) and the charge neutrality condition for all practical purposes remains valid. We have found the requirement of
∆nn(x)=∆pn(x) to be somewhat contrary to student intuition. This is further exasperated by many texts showing the majority
carrier concentration uniform in the neutral regions (see Table I) which misleads the student. Qualitatively, the injected holes
into the n-region disturb the charge neutrality and set-up a ﬁeld here which then drives the electrons towards the SCL until a
steady state is reached between electron drift and diffusion. Thus the increase in the majority carrier concentration towards the
SCL is due to the driving effect of the ﬁeld, En, even though it appears at ﬁrst that ∆nn should decrease towards theSCL as
injected holes recombine with electrons

∼

Once the ﬁeld in the n-region is given as eq.15, the student can readily calculate the various contributions to the total current
density using eq.13. The magnitudes of the various current components (majority carrier diffusion and drift, and minority carrier
diffusion and drift) and their directions are listed in Table II. In general, the drift of the majority carriers is the most signiﬁcant
contribution to the pn junction diode current. How is then the diffusion terminology comes to appear in explaining the diode
current even though the biggest contribution is drift?

Given that the depletion region is very narrow and that recombination in this region is negligibly small due to the very small
concentrations of carriers, then in the steady state one must have ∂Je
∂x = 0 and the electron current Je must be constant through
the SCL. But, electron drift at x’=0, i.e minority carrier drift, is negligible and the electron current there is primarily a diffusion
current just like the hole current in the n-region. Thus the total electron current at x=0 must equal to the electron diffusion
current at x’=0. Similarly the hole diffusion current at x=0 is equal to the total hole current at x’=0 which is essentially by drift.
It is apparent that by evaluating the minority carrier diffusion current just outside depletion region we are indirectly determining
the total majority carrier current at the other side of the depletion region. This is a subtle point that seems to have been short
circuited in the majority of the texts. Consequently, the diode equation stated in equation (10) is only valid if the SCL width is
much shorter than the minority carrier diffusion length in that region

An important paradox that must be addressed by the instructor is the much cherished minority carrier concentration proﬁle
stated in eq.5 for a long diode. Equation 5 is the solution of the continuity equation in the absence of an electric ﬁeld. As a ﬁrst
step one can assume a constant ﬁeld, En, in the neutral region to examine its effects on the excess minority carrier concentration
proﬁle. In the presence of a constant ﬁeld, the general continuity equation in eq.2 leads to

Since this is a linear differential equation, the undergraduate student can readily solve it or accept its solution by substituting

the solution into eq.(3). For a long neutral region, the solution is:

The parameter αn represents the comparative effect of drift to diffusion since Ldrif t =1/2τhnµhnEn is the so-called Schubweg
of the minority carriers, distance drifted before recombination. If the ﬁeld is small α nwill be small and in the limit of zero
Lhn and the theory approaches the conventional zero-ﬁeld treatment. At a forward bias of 0.55V, the ﬁeld
ﬁeld, En ∼
is maximum at x=0, and using this maximum value one ﬁnds αn=0.00106 and an=(1.0011)Lhn. At V=0.65V, an=(1.05)Lhn
and an is still very close to Lhn(within 5%) even though the injected hole concentration is now only ten times smaller than the
equilibrium majority concentration which sets the limit of small injection. Although the solution in eq.(3) does not apply when
the ﬁeld is non-uniform as in eq.15, it does nonetheless provide convenient means for the student to examine the possible effect
of the ﬁeld on the excess minority carrier proﬁle.

The ﬁeld in the p-region can be similarly derived. The total current in the p+ region is

in which bp = µep/µhp is the electron to hole drift mobility ratio in the p-region. We assumed that, as usual under forward
bias, V >> kT /e. Equation (9) shows that the ﬁeld is minimum right at the SCL, x’=0, and increases exponentially to a
constant value away from the junction. Substituting typical values from Table II shows that Ep << En. When the two ﬁelds
are compared, one ﬁnds that En is at least three orders of magntiude greater than Ep. In fact Ep is almost unifrom in the p+-
region. Most interestingly and importantly, even though Ep is even smaller than En, its effect is most signiﬁcant. One readily
can calculate the contributions of each term to the current density in the p-region from eq. 24. The values at the SCL are listed
in Table II where it is apparent that the current is carried almost totally by majority carrier drift. A distinctly different behavior
in the p+-region from that observed in the n-region is the fact that the majority carrier diffusion is insigniﬁcant and that minority
carrier diffusion, though larger than majority diffusion, is some three orders of magnitude smaller than majority carrier drift.
From the above discussion for conduction on the n-side it is clear that in deriving the diode equation we are calculating the hole
(majority) drift current in the p+-region by evaluating the hole (minority) diffusion current in the n-region simply because the
total hole current does not change through the SCL as long as the latter is thinner than the hole diffusion length.

(27)

It is always useful for the student to reconﬁrm that the majority of the voltage drops across the depletion region by evaluating

the voltage drop across the neutral regions. If Vn is the voltage drop across the n-region then

Equation (2) shows that the voltage drops increases exponentially with the applied bias contrary to an intuitive guess. Using
typical values, at V=0.55V, Vn is 0.00168V, whereas at V=0.6V, Vn is 0.019V and the injected hole concentration in the n-region
is about 11% of ND which is the limit of small injection. At V=0.65V, Vn becomes 0.121V which is quite signiﬁcant but at this
bias voltage the injected hole concentration is no longer small compared with ND. There is a clear indication that as the voltage
across the diode increases more and more of the applied voltage drops across the neutral regions which deteriorates the law of
the junction. It is not difﬁcult to show that since Ep << En and lp << ln, the voltage drop across the p+-region is orders of
magnitude smaller than Vn.

IV. NUMERICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PN JUNCTION:

where T1, T2and T3are time constants. Typically for Silicon T1 = τp= 10−
In order to solve the boundary value problem associated with the above system (when a voltage is applied to the PN junction)
we transform it into a new hybrid system of ﬁrst-order (Current and carrier density equations) and one second-order differential
equation (Poisson equation).

5 sec,T2 = τn= 10−

The mathematical/numerical reasons for performing this transformation reside in the fact the above system is a ”singularly
singular perturbed problem” [38, 39]. Many algorithms [39, 41] have been developed in order to deal with this difﬁculty
stemming from several facts:

1. ψ, n and p are fast variables in comparison with E, Jn and Jp [31, 32, 33].

2. Near the limits of the depletion layer the values of n and p change by several orders of magnitude making the space-charge
zone a double boundary layer. This difﬁculty is of the same type as the one encountered in Hydro/Aerodynamics where
the ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld changes by several orders of magnitude near an obstacle.

Recognizing the difﬁculty due to the presence of the space-charge layer, a standard way to ﬁnd a valid solution is to treat
the boundary layer separately from the rest of the diode. In spite of the success of this approach [36, 37], one might feel
uneasy about this artiﬁcial dichotomy and rather tackle the problem with new powerful mathematical/numerical methods
that handle the layer and the rest of the device on the same equal footing.

3. When the above system is rewritten explicitly in terms of the Poisson equation as we will do below, the second spatial
3). Actually, this is the reason
derivative of the electric potential is multiplied by a very small number λ2 (λ
the problem is called singularly perturbed: the solution with λ = 0 is entirely different from the solution with λ ﬁnite but
small [39].

One of the early algorithms aimed at circumventing the above difﬁculties is the Scharfetter-Gummel algorithm [34]. The latter
attempts at segregating the fast/slow variables by integrating out the fast variables over some small interval while holding the
slow variables constant over that same interval. The Scharfetter-Gummel algorithm leads to a spatial exponential discretization
that will alleviate for the rapid variation of the fast variables.

Many variants of the Scharfetter-Gummel algorithm have been developed [35] in order to cure some of its shortcomings
which generally are numerical oscillations and crosswind effects. These lead to a loss of accuracy of the solution and sometimes
preclude convergence towards the solution.

We decided not to use the Gummel algorithm or any of its variants but rather to tackle the problem from the singular perturba-
tion point of view since this approach is more rigorous and leads to a better understanding and control of the instability problem
encountered in the semiconductor system of equations.

The above system is now in the appropriate form to integrate with a powerful B-spline collocation based algorithm speciﬁcally
tailored for two point singularly perturbed boundary value problems: COLSYS [39, 40, 41]. The algorithm is based on a control-
lable meshing technique [41, 42] of the boundary layer which will lead essentially to the damping of the existing singularities.
The layer-damping mesh, being exponential in nature, encompasses the Scharfetter-Gummel case and can be shown rigorously

accurate initial conditions.

Varying the applied bias by steps of 0.1V we calculate the carrier density proﬁles, the potential and the electric ﬁeld.
The drift and diffusion current density proﬁles are also obtained. Several tests are used in order to check the validity of the
solution obtained. The ﬁrst test is an accuracy test whereby we require a given accuracy and check whether the criterion is met.
The next test is based on the requirement of convergence: the collocation builds a non-linear set of equations that has to be
solved iteratively. The additional tests are the independant checks of the constancy of the current densities locally on each side
of the junction and globally over the entire junction. The tests are shown in the current density proﬁle ﬁgures.

The ﬁnal test we use is the approximate validity of Shockley’s equation. Varying the voltage, we obtain the IV characteristics
of the junction and we compare it to the Shockley’s case. Since we have used the Shockley-Read-Hall recombination term all
over the PN junction we do not expect the Shockley’s case but rather the general form:

The comparison of the obtained IV characteristic to the Shockley formula is displayed in Fig. 1. The calculated characteristic
falls between the two Shockley curves η = 1.1 and η = 1.2 in a ﬁnite current interval. This means, the general Shockley formula
is not valid, within the singular perturbation approach, for arbitrary current values.

V. CONCLUSIONS

9

The physics of the PN junction is gaining back interest with new developments in the area of nanoelectronics specially in the
area of spintronics where one has to account for the spin of the carriers in addition to their charge. The usual approximations that
are valid and successful in the description of the PN junction physics at the micron scale must be entirely reviewed and adapted
to the nano scale. The diffusion/drift approximation as well as the nature of the singularities of the problem have been reviewed
and reformulated in a way such that the underlying assumptions are revealed with their consequences.

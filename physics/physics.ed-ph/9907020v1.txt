Abstract.

In classical mechanics a procedure for simultaneous synchro-
nization in all inertial frames is consistent with the Galilean transformation.
However, if one attempts to achieve such synchronization utilizing light sig-
nals, then he will be facing on one hand a break down of absolute simultaneity,
and on the other hand, a self-contradictory transformation that has Lorentz
transformation, or the conﬁnement of Lorentz transformation to the velocity
of light, as the only possible ways that resolve the contradiction. The current
work constitutes a smooth transition from traditional to relativistic vision of
mechanics, and therefore is quite appealing from pedagogical point of view.

Introduction

Time in Newtonian mechanics is considered as an absolute entity, so that one can
choose an instant t0 which can be taken as the initial time in all inertial frames, and
such that when an event occurs at an instant t in one inertial frame then it occurs also
at the same instant t in all inertial frames. The inquiry of how, in principle, can one
synchronize the clocks in all inertial frames receives a number of plausible answers.
One possible hypothetical procedure is as follows: it is suﬃcient to synchronize clocks
in one inertial frame, say S, with a master clock at some point in S, say the origin O,
using a stream of particles emitted radially from O with the same velocity C, so that
on ﬁrst receiving the stream, an observer at a point P sets his clock on t = t0 +
/C,

→
r

→
r is the position vector of the point P and t0 is the time read by the master
where
clock when the stream starts[7].
In this way the space is furnished with a set of
synchronized clocks which can be adopted in all inertial frames. In fact it is straight
forward to see, using the Galilean transformation for the coordinates and the velocity,
that the procedure we have just described does synchronize also the clocks in every
other inertial frame with the master clock at the origin of S, and accordingly with
each other. However if it turns out that the law of velocity addition in Galilean
transformation is not applicable to the stream of particles then synchronization is
beyond reach because the concept of absolute simultaneity ceases to be valid.

We present here a procedure for synchronization using a stream of photons, and
show that in spite of one’s attempt to adhere to the familiar concepts of Newton

mechanics, the shortcomings of these concepts are revealed when synchronization is
attempted for more than one inertial frame. We shall adopt from start the experi-
mental fact [3]that the velocity of light is independent of the state of relative motion
between the source and the observer, which is equivalent to say that this velocity is
a constant C, which is the same in all inertial frames.

2. Synchronization by Light Signals
Let S and S′ be two inertial frames comprising two systems of rectangular Cartesian
coordinates oxyz and o′x′y′z′ respectively, in standard conﬁguration. Assume that
S′ is moving relative to S in the direction of the x-axis with a uniform velocity u
(u > 0). When the plane x′ = 0 in S′ coincide with the plane x= 0 in S, every
observer in the plane x′ = 0 sets his clock T ′ = 0 and simultaneously emits a pulse of
light of short duration parallel to the x′−axis. The assembly of these pulses generates
a plane wave propagating in the ±x′ directions with velocity C. The furthest wave
front appears to the observer O′ at an instant T ′ as occupying two planes |x′| = CT ′,
and hence all observers in these two planes have to set their clocks at T ′. Since time
ﬂaws uniformly in S′, all observers in the region {X′ : |X ′| ≤ CT ′} have the same
clock reading, namely T ′.

For the S-observer the plane wave we have just prescribed appears as originating
from the plane x = 0 and travelling in the ±x−directions with velocity C, for the light
velocity has been assumed to be constant and independent of the source’s motion.
The observer O uses the Galilean transformation to deduce that the equation of the
light’s front is

′

x = x

+ uT

,

which represents two planes corresponding to x′ = ±CT ′ in S′.

An S-observer at a location (x, y, z), on ﬁrst receiving the wave has to set his
clock at T = |x| /C. Dividing (1) by C and making use of T ′ = |x′| /C we get the
equation

T = T

′

′
+ ux

/C 2,

which relates the initial time settings in both frames for the points lying on the wave
front. Although at an instant T ′ in S′, all clocks in the region |X ′| ≤ CT

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
X ≤ |x′| + uT ′, or equivalently (−C + u)T ′ ≤ X ≤ (C + u)T ′, do not read the same
time. In fact all those corresponding to x′ = CT
read T = T ′(1 + u/C), whereas
those corresponding to x′ = −CT ′ read T = T ′(1 − u/C). In other words time is no
more absolute in S, i.e.
in the system which performed synchronization using the
Galilean transformation, and at the same time accepting that the velocity of light
waves emitted from the plane x′ = 0 in S′ is also equal to C in S. The peculiar result

concerning time in S is expected, because the velocity in classical mechanics cannot
be independent of the inertial frame relative to which it is measured.

obviously valid relations y = y′, z = z′ as

Lorentz transformation is obtained on postulating that the last relations are valid
for an arbitrary moment t′ in S′, i.e. we have to replace T ′ in (8) by an arbitrary t′ and
the corresponding T by t. For more details concerning Lorentz transformation and
their properties we refer to [1, 4, 5, 6]. As far as our work is concerned it is important
to note that Lorentz transformation is a point transformation in a four dimensional
manifold (t, x, y, z), in the sense that each point (event) (t, x, y, z) in S is described by
a unique point (t′, x′, y′, z′) in S′, and hence the classical vision of absolute time is no
more valid. Therefore our goal of achieving simultaneous synchronization of inertial
frames is proved impossible, and instead, every frame is synchronized independently.
For more details about the new aspects of space and time we refer to reference[2].

For the points of the synchronization wave front, the relations

4. An Alternative Result

|x| = CT,

|x′| = CT ′

are valid. Hence we may write (1) and (2), according to x′ being positive or negative
in either form

(i) For x′ > 0

(ii) For x′ < 0

x = (1 + u/C)x′,

T = (1 + u/C)T ′.

x = (1 − u/C)x′,

T = (1 − u/C)T ′.

(11)
Since u/C < 1, it is evident that x and x′ are both positive or both negative. An
identical statement is also valid for T and T ′. It is evident, in both cases (i) and (ii),
that the two equations obtained are linearly dependent, and therefore are reducible
to one equation. In fact the second equation in each case is obtained through dividing
both sides of the ﬁrst equation by C or (−C). We shall therefore conﬁne our attention
to the second equation in each case.

Due to symmetry the transformation from S to S′ is obtained by replacing u by

(−u) in (10) and (11); and hence must be

(i) For x > 0

(ii) For x < 0

T ′ = (1 − u/C)T

T ′ = (1 + u/C)

(9)

(10)

(12)

(13)

But these are not the inverse transformation as deduced from (10) and (11). In fact
by (10-13) we have the contradiction:

For x > 0
For x < 0

T = (1 + u/C)T ′ = (1 − u2/C 2)T

T = (1 − u/C)T ′ = (1 − u2/C 2)T,

which is resolved as before by multiplying the right hand-sides of the relations

(10-13) by the factor γ = (1 − u2/C 2)−1/2 to obtain

x = ax′,

T = aT ′

(x′ > 0),

x = x′/a,

T = T ′/a

(x′ < 0),

where

Replacing u by (−u) gives the inverse transformation

a =

(x > 0),

x′ = ax,

(x < 0).

The transformation (14,15) or the inverse transformation (17,18) gives the relations
between the coordinates of an arbitrary point in both frames the moment it receives
the wave of synchronization, or equivalently, the relation between the time settings
by the S and S′-observers at that point when they ﬁrst receive the wave.

It important to notice that the transformation we have just found may be de-
duced from Lorentz transformation. Actually if we set |x′| = CT ′ in (8) we get the
transformation (14,15). Note that for |x′| = CT ′ which is the equation of the fronts of
two waves originating simultaneously from the plane x′ = 0 and travelling in opposite
directions, are transformed by Lorentz transformation (8) into two planes given by
(14,15). The last two planes are not symmetric with respect to x = 0, because the
simultaneous events (T ′, x = ±CT ′, y′, z′) in S′ are not simultaneous in S.

Perhaps it is worthy to mention that the relations (14,15) are equivalent to the
special Lorentz transformation (8) in which we still have the constraints |x′| = CT ′,
and which is applicable only to the positions occupied by the light front and the
corresponding times. Lorentz transformation results indeed from (8) only when we
abandon this constraint and deal with x′ and T ′ as independent variables.

Our approach therefore, leads either to Lorentz transformation itself, or to Lorentz
transformation applicable only to the light propagation. Only a daring step in which
the coordinates and time are liberated from the constraint, we have mentioned, leads
to Lorentz transformation.

5. Conclusion
The Galilean transformation is completely compatible with the concept of absolute
time in classical mechanics. However, when one attempts to incorporate the source-
independent constant velocity of light in Galilean transformation then he will be faced
from start by a type of transformation, namely the wrong intermediate transformation
(1,2) which terminates the concept of simultaneity and accordingly absolute time.

Following up this result and accepting the symmetric roles of inertial frames we
deduce that the transformation from S to S′ result from (1,2) by simply replacing u
by (−u). The ﬁnal transformation we are seeking must be satisﬁed by the coordinates
of any event that are measured by observers in the two frames. The mathematical
expression of the last statement is that the transformation from one frame to another
must be inverse to each other. This requirement determines a factor (γ) by which
we have to scale the right hand-sides of the intermediate transformation to obtain
formally the Lorentz transformation. Although, it is known to every physicist that
Lorentz transformation is the correct substitute of the Galilean transformation, the
method we have followed to derive this transformation is new and has nice features
manifested in the smooth transition from Newtonian to relativistic concepts.

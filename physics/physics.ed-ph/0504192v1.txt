On the transformation of torques between the laboratory and
center of mass reference frames

Abstract

It is commonly stated in Newtonian Mechanics that the torque with respect to the laboratory frame
is equal to the torque with respect to the center of mass frame plus a R × F factor, with R being the
position of the center of mass and F denoting the total external force. Although this assertion is true,
there is a subtlety in the demonstration that is overlooked in the textbooks.

Keywords: Torque, center of mass, transformation of torques, ﬁcticious forces.

In Newtonian Mechanics, we deﬁne the total external torque of a system of n particles (with respect to

the laboratory frame) as

Next =

ri × Fi(e) ,

n

i=1
X

ri = r′

i + R ,

where ri, Fi(e) denote the position and total external force for the i − th particle. The relation between the
position coordinates between the laboratory (L) and center of mass (CM) reference frames is given by

with R denoting the position of the CM about the L, and r′
i denoting the position of the i−th particle with
respect to the CM, in general the prime notation denotes variables measured with respect to the CM. An
standard demonstration shows that [1]

Next =

i × Fi(e)

+ R × F ,

where F corresponds to the total external force on the system (measured by the L). It is usually said that
the ﬁrst term on the right side of Eq. (1) provides the external torque relative to the CM. Strictly speaking
this is not the case, since Fi(e) is a force measured with respect to the L system, and since the CM is not in
general an inertial reference frame, the force measured by the CM is not equal to the force in the L system.
As it is well known from the theory of non-inertial systems, the total force on the i−th particle measured
about the CM reads

i = Fi − miACM .

Taking into account that the force on the i−th particle is given by the sum of the external forces plus the
internal ones we have

where Fik denotes the internal force on the i−th particle due to the k−th particle, mi is the corresponding
mass, and ACM the acceleration of the CM with respect to the L. Now, if we take into account that the

internal forces are independent of the reference frame1, and combining Eqs. (2, 3) we get

From Eq. (4), the external torque about the CM becomes

From Eq. (6) we can assert that the total external torque about the laboratory is equal to the external torque
about the center of mass plus the torque equivalent to a particle located at the position of the center of mass
undergoing the total external force of the system of particles.

This coincides with the assertion given in commontexts. However, such statement follows from Eq. (6)
and not from Eq. (1) as appears in the literature. Moreover, as it is clear from the development above, the
demonstration of Eq. (5) is the clue to asseverate this statement. In turn, Eq. (5) is satisﬁed because the
ﬁcticious forces do not contribute to the total external torque.

Finally, this clariﬁcation is also necessary to establish the equation

dLCM
dt

= NCM ,

with LCM denoting the total angular momentum of the system of particles about the CM. As it is well
known, this equation is valid even if the center of mass is a non-inertial system of reference [1], in whose
case the ﬁcticious forces should be included in the demonstration.

1In the case of central internal forces it is clear since they are functions of the relative positions among diﬀerent pairs of
particles. Nevertheless, even in the case in which the forces are not central, they depend on relative positions, relative velocities,
relative acelerations etc. So that the invariance under diﬀerent frames still holds.

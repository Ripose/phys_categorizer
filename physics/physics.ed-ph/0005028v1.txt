We show how Geophysics may illustrate and thus improve classical Mechanics lectures concerning
the study of Coriolis force eﬀects. We are then interested in atmospheric as well as oceanic phenom-
ena we are familiar with, and are for that reason of pedagogical and practical interest. Our aim is
to model them in a very simple way to bring out the physical phenomena that are involved.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of mechanics in non-inertial frames, the
Coriolis force eﬀects for the rotating Earth being the
paradigm, are often restricted to the standard examples
of a deﬂected projectile and the Foucault pendulum. In
these two examples, the Coriolis force is only a small
perturbation. In order to make the Coriolis force eﬀects
dominant, one must consider phenomena taking place at
the geophysical scale.

This is the line followed by the present paper. The
ﬁrst section is devoted to the presentation of the basic
equations. In the second section, we discuss the Physics
of anticyclones and cyclones: we describe their rotation
in the geostrophic approximation, and show how cyclones
(but not anticyclones) may become hurricanes. The third
section presents a second example of atmospheric circula-
tion, the Jets Streams, which are stabilized by the Corio-
lis force. We show also that these strong winds are asso-
ciated with Rossby waves. The last section presents two
examples of oceanic circulation: wind-driven circulation
and Kelvin waves.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

A. Navier-Stokes equation in a rotating frame

Let us introduce two frames R and R′ in relative mo-
tion. The inertial frame R is the geocentric one, with
origin at the center O of the Earth, and whose axes are
along directions of ﬁxed stars. The frame R′ is fastened
to the Earth. It has an angular velocity Ω with respect
to R, where Ω is the angular velocity of rotation of the
Earth (Ω ≃ 7.29 · 10−5 rad · s−1). The following relation
between the accelerations of a point M aR(M ) in R, and
aR′(M ) in R′ may easily be obtained [1]:
aR(M ) = aR′(M ) + 2Ω ∧ vR′ (M ) + Ω ∧ (Ω ∧ OM ).
(2.1)

In eq. (2.1), the term 2Ω ∧ vR′(M ) is the Coriolis ac-
celeration, vR′(M ) is the velocity of M in R′, and
In the
Ω ∧ (Ω ∧ OM ) is the centrifugal acceleration.

rotating frame R′, the Navier-Stokes equation takes into
account the above inertial terms and reads [2]:

∂vR′

∂t

+ (vR′ · ∇)vR′ = −

1
ρ

∇p +

1
ρ

f − 2Ω ∧ vR′

− Ω ∧ (Ω ∧ OM ) + ν∆vR′ .
(2.2)

The force f includes the gravitational force and other
external forces if they exist, ρ is the density of the ﬂuid
and p the pressure ﬁeld. The dependence on M has been
removed in all the terms for clarity. The centrifugal force
is conservative.
If this is also the case for f , one can
rewrite the terms ∇p, −f and ρΩ ∧ (Ω ∧ OM ) as ∇p′,
where p′ is called dynamical pressure.
In the rotating
frame, the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is: ∇p′ =
0. The dynamical pressure p′ reads, within a constant,
p′ = p + ρgz, where g is the Earth gravity ﬁeld. Recall
that g includes the centrifugal term, and is thus slightly
diﬀerent from the gravitational ﬁeld, which only takes
into account the Earth’s attraction [1].

B. Reynolds and Rossby numbers

The nonlinearity of the Navier-Stokes equation makes
it diﬃcult to solve in general. It is hence necessary to
evaluate the relative importance of the diﬀerent terms
in order to make further simpliﬁcations. This is done
by introducing the diﬀerent characteristic scales of the
ﬂow: L denotes the typical spatial extension, U the ve-
locity, Ω the angular velocity and ν the kinematic viscos-
ity. Two non-dimensional numbers may then be derived
from these scales.

(i) The Reynolds number is deﬁned as:

Re =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

=

U 2/L
νU/L2 =

U L
ν

.

(2.3)

(v · ∇)v

ν∆v (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

It characterizes the relative importance of the momen-
tum transport in the ﬂuid through advection and vis-
cous diﬀusion. For the atmospheric ﬂows studied here,
typical values are: U ∼ 10 m · s−1, L ∼ 10 km and
ν ∼ 10−5 m2 · s−1. Thus, the Reynolds number is

about 1010. A large value of the Reynolds number is
also obtained for oceanic ﬂows [3]. Hence, the Navier-
Stokes equation reduces, for geophysical ﬂows, to the Eu-
ler equation:

∂vR′

∂t

+ (vR′ · ∇)vR′ = −

1
ρ

∇p +

1
ρ

f

− 2Ω ∧ vR′ − Ω ∧ (Ω ∧ OM ).
(2.4)

Moreover, geophysical ﬂows are turbulent (high Reynolds
number) [4]. For the sake of simplicity, we ignore this
complication in what follows. A simple way of taking
into account the relevant eﬀects of turbulence will be pre-
sented in the last section. (See section V A.)

(ii) The Rossby number is deﬁned as:

In these equations, f ≡ 2Ω sin λ is the Coriolis param-
eter.
In equation (3.1c), the term 2ρ(Ω⊥ ∧ v) · uz is
small compared to ρg (ΩU/g ∼ 10−5). Equation (3.1c)
therefore reduces to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation
∂p/∂z = −ρg.
If we consider the case of an eddy in the Northern
hemisphere and assume that the velocity ﬁeld is tangen-
tial (u = 0), then, v < 0 (clockwise rotation) implies
∂p/∂r < 0. The pressure is higher at the eddy center
than outside: it is an anticyclone. A cyclone would cor-
respond to an anticlockwise rotation. Both situations are
represented in ﬁgure 1. The rotation senses are opposite
in the southern hemisphere.

It compares the advection and the rotation eﬀects. The
Coriolis force dominates if Ro ≪ 1. A geophysical ﬂow,
characterized by a large spatial extension, may easily be
inﬂuenced by the Earth’s rotation, as one typically has
Ro ∼ 10−2 ≪ 1. On the other hand, an emptying bath-
tub with U ∼ 1 m · s−1, and L ∼ 10−1m, has Ro ∼ 105.
Such a ﬂow is more strongly inﬂuenced by the advection
in the ﬂuid, and thus by the initial conditions, than by
the Earth’s rotation.

the presence of the Coriolis force:

We end this section with two concluding remarks about

We consider ﬁrst the situation when the Rossby num-
ber is negligible. This is the case for anticyclones
and cyclones since one typically has U ∼ 10 m · s−1,
In the Euler
L ∼ 1000 km, which yields Ro ∼ 0.1.
equation (2.4), we only have to keep the gravity, pres-
sure and Coriolis terms. This hypothesis constitutes the
geostrophic approximation. For each point M of the
Earth, we deﬁne a vertical axis (M z), and a cylindri-
cal coordinate system (r, θ, z). The vertical component
of the velocity ﬁeld is supposed to be zero, which implies
that the movements of the ﬂuid are locally horizontal. u
is the radial component of the velocity ﬁeld and v the
tangential one. The Earth’s angular velocity Ω is writ-
ten as Ω = Ωk + Ω⊥ where Ωk ≡ Ω sin λ uz and Ω⊥
is Ω’s projection on the plane (r, θ); λ is the latitude.
The ﬂow is supposed to be stationary. In this system of
coordinates, the Euler equation can be rewritten, under
the geostrophic approximation, as:

(i) Without this force, an eddy center is always a pres-
sure minimum. However, in the case of the anticyclone,
the Coriolis force stabilizes the inverse situation, with the
eddy center being a pressure maximum.

(ii) In its vectorial form, the geostrophic equilibrium
equation reads: ∇p′ = −2ρΩ ∧ v. This implies that
the pressure p′ is constant along a streamline. When the
usual Bernoulli equation is valid, pressure variations are,
on the contrary, associated with velocity variations along
a streamline.

B. Hurricanes

Let us consider an eddy (anticyclone or cyclone) whose
angular velocity and radius are respectively ω and R.
The Rossby number characterizing this eddy can be writ-
ten as Ro = U/LΩ = ω/Ω. Therefore, the geostrophic
equilibrium corresponds to a small angular velocity of the
eddy, i.e. ω ≪ Ω. We shall now consider the case where
the eddy’s angular velocity is not small compared to the
Earth’s rotation. This means that the centrifugal force
due to the eddy rotation has to be taken into account.
In this case, the Rossby number is of order unity. In the

frame R′, the ﬂuid particle has a uniform circular mo-
tion. Forces acting on it are the Coriolis force and the
radial pressure gradient. The equation of motion for a
ﬂuid particle, located at the eddy’s periphery reads, in
R′:

1
ρ

dp
dr

−r0ω2 = −

+ r0f ω,

(3.2)

where r0 is the eddy radius. The term −r0ω2 corresponds
to the centrifugal acceleration of the ﬂuid particle, and
r0f ω is the Coriolis term.

An anticyclone in the northern hemisphere is shown
in ﬁgure 1a. For such an equilibrium, the Coriolis force
compensates both pressure and centrifugal forces. If the
angular velocity of the anticyclone grows, the Coriolis
force is not suﬃcient to counterbalance these two forces
since the centrifugal force grows faster than the Corio-
lis force with increasing ω. This is not the case for the
cyclone depicted in the ﬁgure 1b. The pressure and cen-
trifugal forces may counterbalance each other when the
rotation of the cyclone becomes faster. This qualitative
approach shows that there is no limit to the kinetic en-
ergy of rotation for a cyclone.

More quantitatively, equation (3.2) can be solved to

ﬁnd:

ω± =

f

2 "−1 ±r1 +

G

G0# ,

(3.3)

where G ≡ dp/dr and G0 ≡ ρr0f 2/4. Figure 2 gives the
evolution of an eddy angular velocity as a function of the
radial pressure gradient. In this ﬁgure, the geostrophic
situation can be found around the origin (small pressure
gradient and angular velocity).
In the northern hemi-
sphere, the sign of the angular velocity is the same as
that of the pressure gradient. One can even obtain the
angular velocity of an eddy by developing the expres-
sion (3.3) around zero: ω ≈ f G/4G0.

FIG. 2. Normalized angular velocity as a function of the

The condition G > −G0, for the existence of the above
solutions, gives a limit to the angular velocity of an anti-
cyclone (G < 0). One ﬁnds ωmax = 2Ω sin λ. This limit

3

does not exist for a cyclone (G > 0). When the angular
velocity grows, the radial pressure gradient follows this
evolution and becomes more and more important. This
explains why hurricanes are always associated with very
low pressure.

We note in conclusion that the balance between the
centrifugal force and the radial pressure gradient is pos-
sible whatever the sense of rotation. Thus, the existence
of clockwise hurricanes in the northern hemisphere can-
not be excluded. However, most of the hurricanes ob-
served in the northern hemisphere are anticlockwise and
result from the ampliﬁcation of earlier tropical cyclones,
the ampliﬁcation mechanism being the conversion of the
latent heat of evaporating tropical warm waters into ro-
tational kinetic energy.

IV. JET STREAMS AND ROSSBY WAVES

The diﬀerence in solar heating between the equatorial
and polar regions drives a convective cell at the plane-
tary length scale, the Hadley cell, which extends in both
hemispheres from the Equator up to the sub-tropical lat-
itudes. The heated equatorial air rises, moves toward
the poles where it cools, then sinks and comes back to
the equator. When coming back, the air is deﬂected
toward the west by the Coriolis force, generating east-
erlies at the tropical latitudes which are known as the
Trade Winds. Conversely, the upper-troposphere tra-
jectories toward the poles are deﬂected toward the east.
Because of the thermal structure of the atmosphere [5],
these upper-level westerlies concentrate in narrow tubes
of very strong winds up to 80 m · s−1, the Jet Streams.
The Jet Streams are typically found at altitudes of about
10 km and at latitudes between 30◦ and 40◦. However,
their strength and location may depart signiﬁcantly from
these mean values, depending on the season, the longi-
tude, and the day-to-day thermal structure of the atmo-
sphere at mid latitudes. It can be noted that B. Piccard
and B. Jones took great advantage of the Jet Streams for
their recent travel around the world in a balloon. The Jet
Streams are also useful to the planes ﬂying from America
to Europe.

In this section, we propose to show how a zonal wind
(i.e. along the parallels) may be stabilized by the Coriolis
force. A mass M of air near the Earth’s surface is reduced
to a point G. Its coordinates are the usual spherical ones
(R, θ, ϕ), θ being the colatitude and R the radius of the
Earth. The velocity of G can then be explicitly written:
vR′ (G) = R ˙θ uθ + R ˙ϕ sin θ uϕ. The quantity R ˙ϕ sin θ
is the drift velocity u0 of the point G along a parallel.
We deduce the following expression of the Coriolis force
moment about the centre of the Earth (point O):

MO = 2M R2Ω ˙θ uθ + 2M RΩu0 cos θ uϕ.

(4.1)

The computation of the angular momentum of G about

O, in the frame R′, yields:

LR′(O) = −(M R2) ˙ϕ sin θ uθ + (M R2) ˙θ uϕ.

(4.2)

The theorem of angular momentum for the point G,
about O and projected on uϕ gives:

−¨λ = 2

Ωu0

sin λ,

(4.3)

where λ ≡ π/2 − θ is the latitude. This equation is
linearized for small deviations around a given latitude
λ0, leading to

¨δλ +(cid:20)2

Ωu0
R

cos λ0(cid:21) δλ = 0,

(4.4)

where δλ ≡ λ − λ0. The meridional motion of G re-
mains bounded, only if u0 > 0, which corresponds to a
drift velocity from west to east. This motion is char-
acterized by small oscillations around the mean latitude

λ0 with angular frequency ω0 = p2Ωu0 cos λ0/R. These

oscillations correspond to the stationary case of a Rossby
wave [6]. More generally, Rossby waves in the atmosphere
are guided by strong westerlies.

V. OCEANIC CIRCULATION

Oceanic circulation is, of course, described by the
same equations as atmospheric circulation. For large
scale oceanic currents, like e.g.
the Gulf stream, the
geostrophic approximation (see section III A) is relevant:
the Coriolis force compensates the horizontal pressure
gradient, which is related to the slope of the free surface,
which is not necessarily horizontal [7].

We shall be interested here in a slightly diﬀerent case
for which the interaction between the wind and the ocean
gives rise to a current.

A. Wind-driven circulation : Ekman transport

The wind induces a friction at the ocean surface, trans-
mitted through turbulence to the deeper layers of the
sea. There is a supplementary diﬃculty that we can-
not ignore here. The ﬂow is not laminar, but essentially
turbulent. The ﬂuid viscosity is related to molecular ag-
itation, dissipating the energy of a ﬂuid particle. A dif-
fusive momentum transport is associated with this phe-
nomenon.
In a turbulent ﬂow, agitation dissipates the
energy associated with the mean velocity of the current.
This analogy allowed Prandtl to introduce the notion of
an eddy viscosity [4]. In this approximation, considering
vR′ as the mean ﬂow velocity, the Navier-Stokes equation
(2.2) remains unchanged, the eddy viscosity νturb being
added to the kinematic viscosity ν. It must be remarked
that the former is a property of the ﬂow while the latter
is a property of the ﬂuid. As far as geophysical ﬂows

are concerned, the kinematic viscosity is neglected, since
typically νturb/ν ∼ 105 for oceanic ﬂows, and νturb/ν is
about 107 for atmospheric ﬂows.
Let us write the Navier-Stokes equation in projection
on (Oxyz), where (Oxy) is the surface of the globe, (Oz)
the ascendant vertical, and (u, v, w) are the velocity com-
ponents:

(5.1)

For a stationary situation with large Rossby number, the
acceleration terms are negligible: the velocity depends
then only on space. The horizontal pressure gradient
terms can also be neglected since the equations have been
linearized and one can consider the real physical situa-
tion as the superposition of a geostrophic current (taking
into account the pressure terms) and a wind-driven cur-
rent, which will now be described. We consider a solution
depending on space only through the coordinate z. The
boundary conditions are the following: the velocity has
to be ﬁnite both as z → −∞ and at the free surface,
the stress is proportional to ∂v/∂z and parallel to the
wind ﬂow, assumed to be in the (Oy) direction. One can
solve eq.(5.1) and ﬁnd the velocity ﬁeld (the solution is
straightforward deﬁning W (z) ≡ u(z) + iv(z)):
δ(cid:17) exp(cid:16) z
δ(cid:17) ,

MEAN CURRENT

FIG. 4. Surface shape generated by a Kelvin wave.

The Kelvin waves are in fact easily observed, since the
currents generated by tides are inﬂuenced by the Coriolis
force and give rise to them. As a consequence, the coast is
always to the right of the ﬂow direction (in the northern
hemisphere). On the oceanic basin scale, mean move-
ments are in this case an anticlockwise rotation around a
point called amphidromic point. This geometry is found
in many places over the globe, the rotation being clock-
wise in the southern hemisphere [9].

VI. CONCLUSION

Coriolis force eﬀects become important as soon as the
spatial extension of the ﬂow is important (Ro ∝ 1/L).
This is the reason why the Earth’s rotation considerably
inﬂuences the atmosphere and oceans dynamics. We have
presented in this paper several simple examples of geo-
physical ﬂuid dynamics. We hope it will be helpful for
Mechanics teachers to illustrate inertial eﬀects with sim-
ple but physically relevant examples.

Close to the surface (z = 0), the current deviates 45◦,
and the direction of the velocity rotates clockwise (anti-
clockwise) in the northern (southern) hemisphere. The
amplitude of the velocity decreases exponentially on a
length scale δ, which represents the characteristic depth
over which the inﬂuence of the wind is signiﬁcant. This
velocity ﬁeld, the so-called Ekman spiral, is plotted in
ﬁgure 3. The mean eﬀect of the wind, over a depth δ, is
the ﬂuid motion in a direction perpendicular to it: this
eﬀect is called the Ekman transport.

B. Kelvin waves

The main diﬀerence between atmospheric ﬂows and
oceanic ﬂows occurs near in the coastline, limiting the
waters motion. This is the origin of Kelvin waves.
If
one considers the deformation of the free surface of the
oceans, one can see that gravity acts as a restoring force,
giving rise to a “gravity wave” [8]. When inﬂuenced by
the Earth’s rotation, these waves are called “modiﬁed
waves” [9].

Let us consider the following geometry: a south-north
current, with a coast on its right (east). The coast is
supposed to be a vertical wall, the water height being de-
noted h0 + h(x, y, t). The Coriolis force usually deﬂects
a south-north current toward the east, i.e. toward the
coast. Hence water gathers close to the coast, and gives
rise to an west-east horizontal pressure gradient counter-
balancing the Coriolis force. The equations describing
the gravity waves are the linearized Euler and continuity
equations [8]:

Taking (Oy) perpendicular to the coast, and considering

obtains:

The dispersion relation is given by ω2 = gh0k2, as for
usual gravity waves. The characteristic length L ≡
√gh0/f is the Rossby radius of deformation. At a mid-
latitude λ ∼ 45◦, one ﬁnds L ∼ 2200 km for h0 ∼ 5 km,
while for a shallow sea, i.e. h0 ∼ 100 m, one rather has
L ∼ 300 km. The surface shape generated by the Kelvin

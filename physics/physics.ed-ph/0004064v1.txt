The matching conditions at the interface between two non-mixed ﬂuids at rest are obtained
directly using the equation of movement of the whole media. This is a non-usual point of view
in hydrodynamics courses and our aim is to ﬁx ideas about the intrinsic information contained
in the matching conditions, on ﬂuids in this case. Afterward, it is analyzed the polarization of
the normal modes at the interface and it is shown that this information can be achieved through
a physical analysis and reinforced later by the matching conditions. A detailed analysis of the
matching conditions is given to understand the role that plays the continuity of the stress tensor
through the interface on the physics of the surface particle movement. The main importance of the
viscosity of each medium is deduced.

En el presente trabajo se utilizan las ecuaciones de movimiento de todo el sistema compuesto
por dos ﬂuidos no miscibles en reposo relativo para obtener las condiciones de empalme en la
intercara. Este procedimiento es inusual y el objetivo de hacerlo en esa forma es ﬁjar ideas sobre la
informaci´on que est´a contenida en dichas condiciones de empalme, en este caso en ﬂuidos. Posterior-
mente es analizada la polarizaci´on de los modos normales en la interface y se demuestra que estas
caracter´ısticas pueden ser obtenidas directamente de an´alisis f´ısico de las condiciones de empalme.

I. INTRODUCTION

The boundary conditions constitute the key feature in
any theory of surface waves.
It is through them that
one introduces in the analysis the physical consequences
of speciﬁc surface eﬀects, such as local changes of mass
or stresses, thus going beyond the simple case in which
one merely matches two semi-inﬁnite bulk media at an
interface (which, in particular, can be a free surface).

In the last years, increased attention has been paid
to the properties of capillary waves by physicists and
chemists [1–8]. Ripples represent one of the few cases
in which the relation between the dynamical properties
of a surface and liquid ﬂows can be predicted completely.
The study of capillary ripples has clariﬁed which proper-
ties of a liquid surface determine the surface’s resistance
against deformation.

The boundary conditions for the stress at the interface
are derived from the principle that the forces acting upon
such an “interfacial” element result not only from viscous
stresses in the liquid but also from stresses existing in the

deformed interface. The cause of the diﬀerence is that
an interface, unlike a three dimensional liquid, can not
enjoy the property of incompressibility [1]. Work done
on an element of liquid is partially degrade into heat by
viscous friction and partially transformed into kinetic en-
ergy which is transmitted to adjoining elements. Work
done on an interfacial element leads, at least partially, to
an increment of the surface potential energy. It is this
potential energy of the deformed interface which enables
the whole system, including the interface, to carry out
an oscillatory motion.

In this article, ﬁrst, it will be shown a non-traditional
way to obtain the matching conditions at the interface be-
tween two non-mixed ﬂuid at rest, considering the equa-
tion of motion of the whole media directly. Usually, uni-
versity courses do not use this approach and state the
boundary conditions from outside the constitutive equa-
tions governing the studied problem. It is important from
a pedagogical point of view to evidence that in fact, the
matching conditions at the interfaces are contained, al-
most in all cases, in the equation of movement for the
whole system taken as the composition of all media. The

other cases arise when the ﬂuid interfaces have intrinsic
properties not included on the equations of the media in
that cases mentioned before.

This point of view was already used in [9–13] to elab-
orate a formalism, based on Surface Green Functions,
which establish an isomorphism between solids and ﬂu-
ids related to the interface normal modes. The aim of this
paper is to emphasize the fact that this way to establish
the matching conditions allows us to introduce the phys-
ical characteristics related with the boundary conditions
in a ﬁrmer ﬂoating.

The solution of the system (5), (6) and (7) written as a
vector ﬁeld velocity, can be putted as the sum of an irro-
tational ﬁeld (related with the longitudinal mode) and a
divergence free ﬁeld (related with the transverse modes)
[1], i.e.:

To achieve a system of equations which describes the
oscillatory motion of a viscous incompressible ﬂuid, the
starting point is the linearized Navier-Stokes equation for
a viscous ﬂuid [14], which reads:

The subscripts i and j take the values y and z identically.
In (1) the sum over repeated subscripts is understood. It
had been assumed that the system is symmetric with re-
spect to the x direction.

Also the continuity equation is needed, which expresses
that the volume of an element of the incompressible ﬂuid
does not change during the motion. It has the form [14]

The ﬁrst step is to obtain the equation of motion and
its solution of the each medium taken as inﬁnite. So,

Any irrotational ﬁeld is characterized by a scalar func-

tion, the “potential” function ϕ(y, z, t), such that

V 1 = −∇ϕ

(11)

and the divergence free ﬁeld can be described by a vector
function [14], the “stream” or vorticity function ψ(y, z, t),
such that

V 2 =(cid:18)−

∂ψ

of the potential and the stream functions, as:

Substitution of eqns. (13) and (14) in the continuity

condition (5) gives

∇2ϕ = 0

and substitution into eqns. (6) and (7) leads to

(18)

(19)

The constants C1 and C2 are obtained from the condi-
tion at zero ﬂow, and it gives raise to C1 = po and C2 = 0
where po is the reference atmospheric pressure.

The solution of equations (15), (18) and (19) are look-

ing for as the following

ϕ(y, z, t) = Φ(z) ei(κy − ωt)
ψ(y, z, t) = Ψ(z) ei(κy − ωt)

(20)

(21)

Superscript 1 denotes medium M1 and superscript 2
denotes medium M2. The rest of the matching conditions
at the interface are derived from the system of equations
which govern the whole system. This is no usually done
in the normal program courses at the Universities and we
consider that it is important to state that the matching
conditions are, almost in all of the cases, contained in
the equation of movement for the whole system taken as
the composition of each one. These are eqns. (3) and (4)
where the parameters η and ρ are constant, but taking
diﬀerent values on each medium. Integrating these equa-
tions through the surface about z = 0 from −ǫ to +ǫ and
later taking ǫ → 0, it is obtained from eq. (3)

where the parameters κ and ω are the wavevector and
frequency of the wave respectively.

Substituting eqns. (20) and (21) in (15) and (19) gives
the z-dependence of the functions ϕ and ψ, which satisfy:

"η1  ∂V (1)

with q2

Equations (22) and (23) lead to the solutions:

Φ(z) = C1 eκz +C2 e
Ψ(z) = C3 eqtz +C4 e

−κz

−qtz

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

and in combination with eqns. (20) and (21) they give a
solution of the form:

ϕ(y, z, t) =(cid:16)C1 eκz +C2 e
ψ(y, z, t) =(cid:16)C3 eqtz +C4 e

−κz(cid:17) ei(κy − ωt)
−qtz(cid:17) ei(κy − ωt)

(26)

(27)

where C1, C2, C3 and C4 are constants to be determined
by boundary and matching conditions.

Then, the expressions for the varying velocity com-
ponents and the pressure are ﬁnally obtained by substi-
tution of eqns. (26) and (27) into (13), (14) and (18),
respectively.

III. INTERFACE PROBLEM: MATCHING

CONDITIONS.

Now we will match the two media. We consider a sur-
face which at rest coincides with the plane z = 0 and
it separates medium M1 at z < 0 from medium M2 at
z > 0. Each one is viscous and incompressible.

First of all, any solution has to fulﬁll the continuity of

the velocity ﬁeld across the surface according to

(31)

where pγ is the jump due to the surface tension according
with the Laplace Law [14]. The other terms in eqns. (3)
and (4) vanish when ǫ → 0 because they are continuous
or have a ﬁnite jump at z = 0.

It is easily seen according to eq. (2) that eqns. (30)
and (31) are the conditions of the continuity of the stress
tensor components through the interface, as expected.

On the other hand, the boundary conditions of the
problem are regularity at z → ±∞, which leads to elim-
inate 4 of the 8 constants appearing in (26) and (27) for
the two media. Using the resulting functions ϕ and ψ for
each medium in conditions (28)-(31) the following system
is met:

tions d41 = −η1Qt1 −iΥ, d43 = 2iκη1qt1
Qt1 = 2κ2 − iρ1ω/η1 and Qt2 = 2κ2 − iρ2ω/η2.

In deducing the expression in system (32) which comes

from (31) it was considered that

pγ = −γ

on the surface, but as we are dealing with the velocity
ﬁeld, then it is obtained that:

(34)

which ﬁnally leads to:

pγ = −

(−κC1 + iκC3) ei(κy − ωt)

(35)

according to the substitution ∂/∂t → −iω and ∂/∂y →
−κ2

The vanishing of the determinant of (32) leads to the
equation for the dispersion relation of the existing surface
modes. It can be written as:

ω2(cid:2)(ρ1 + ρ2)(ρ1qt2 + ρ2qt1) − κ(ρ1 − ρ2)2(cid:3) +

+ γκ3 [ρ1(κ − qt2) + ρ2(κ − qt1)] +
+ 4κ3(η2 − η1)2(κ − qt1)(κ − qt2) +

+ 4iκ2ω(η2 − η1)(ρ1κ − ρ2κ − ρ1qt2 + ρ2qt1) = 0 (36)

This is the dispersion relation for capillary waves for

the interface of two viscous incompressible ﬂuids.

In order to obtain the constants C1, C2, C3 and C4, an
initial stimulus is needed according to an initial value
problem [15] but this method, simple at the beginning,
becomes rather complicated later and it is not good for
a quite general study.

As was said on the introduction, the aim of this paper
is not to get inside the dispersion relation of the nor-
mal modes at the interface of two viscous ﬂuids at rest.
For a better study of this subject we recommend paper
[16]. We get here to show a way of solution also diﬀerent
from the usually taken as only the velocity vector as a
function of an ”stream function”. From now on, we will
put our attention on the matching conditions and we will
show that more that a mathematical information of the
matching can be found on it, but also the physics of the
polarization can be deduced and how the interface moves
in its oscillation.

From eqns.

(30) and (31) it can be obtained more
information about the polarization of the modes on the
interface. This will be done in the next section.

mean that there are no longitudinal modes of oscillation
on the interface when the ﬂuids involved are incompress-
ible. It had been shown in [1] that the interface, when
oscillating, must be considered as a compressible one, be-
cause precisely its change in area is responsable for the
increasing of its potential energy and therefore, for its
oscillation.
It is important to state that this is a fun-
damental argument to understand the movement of any
interface in hydrodynamics.

Nevertheless, now it can be shown that in spite of the
compressibility of the interface, there does not exist pure
longitudinal mode if we are dealing with incompressible
media. Let us demonstrate this.

If a point yo on the interface is considered moving with
velocity, say V S
yo in the y-axis direction, then, according
to the continuity of velocity, the point (yo,−ǫ) in M1 and
the point (yo,+ǫ) in M2 must have the same velocity V S
yo
if ǫ is small enough. As the interface is compressible,
at the point y1 near enough yo the velocity can be, for
instance, V S
yo but as the me-
dia are incompressible, at the point (y1,−ǫ) and (y1,+ǫ)
the velocity must be V S
yo. See Fig. 1. This is not in
conformity with the continuity of the velocity through
the surface and hence the pure longitudinal mode is not
possible and only the TN mode seems to be valid when
the media are incompressible.

y1 diﬀerent in general from V S

After these considerations during the above demon-
stration, the student can keep the idea that the interface
oscillations can only occur in the z-axis. This is the ac-
curate moment to show to the student that things not
always are as they apparently seem to be, because that
assumption does not take into account the diﬀerent prop-
erties of each medium, whose response depends on its
fundamental parameters, as density and viscosity, which
are diﬀerent for each medium. Hence, it is evident that it
must be analyzed, precisely, the interface matching con-
ditions.

It is useful to compare and to support the previous
qualitative analysis with a quantitative and more pro-
found one regarding the interface matching conditions.

Recalling carefully eqns. (30) and (31) and supposing
that such a wave propagates in y direction with move-
ment only in z direction (TN mode), then V (1)
y =
0 and eq. (30) becomes

y = V (2)

IV. MATCHING CONDITIONS AND

POLARIZATION.

η1

= η2

(37)

There are two possible modes on the ﬂuid: one in which
the ﬂuid particle moves in the direction of the wave prop-
agation called longitudinal with notation L(Vy,0) and an-
other transverse to the direction of the wave propagation
and normal to the interface with notation TN(0,Vz ).

The longitudinal mode is related to the ﬂuid compress-
ibility because this motion of the ﬂuid particles is only
possible when its volume changes [14]. This analysis also
holds when the mode is on the interface, but this does not

∂V (2)

z

∂y (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z = 0+

It is known that Vz is continuous along the interface for
all points. Then, the derivative with respect to y is also
the same in both hands of (37) and this expression only
holds if η1 = η2, i.e., if the media have the same viscosity.
It does not mean for the interface to disappear because
the density of each medium can be diﬀerent. Then, if
the viscosities of the media have not the same value, the
velocity component Vy along the interface must be diﬀer-
ent from zero to compensate the inequality (37) and to

fulﬁll the continuity of the stress tensor in the y direction
given by eq. (30) yielding to a component of movement
along y direction. This mode will be called Sagittal mode
or S(Vy, Vz ).

The above analysis was done for the general case. Now
we are able to take the particular case in which one of the
media is vacuum, for instance, M2, with η2 = 0. Then,
condition (30) becomes

"η1  ∂V (1)

y
∂z

+

z

∂V (1)

∂y !#z = 0−

= 0

(38)

and it can be seen that also Vy must be non zero on the
surface to hold eq. (38) with the corresponding Sagittal
polarization movement.

With this analysis on the conditions of stress compo-
nent continuity in y direction along the interface, it can
be seen that if the two media are viscous (at least one of
them), the ﬂuid particle of the interface moves in a Sagit-
tal mode which combines movement in both directions:
along the wave propagation in y direction, and normal to
the interface in z direction.

Then, it is qualitatively clear that the viscosity of each
media plays a fundamental role in the coupling of modes
even for incompressible ﬂuids. In spite of that, it could be
a mistake to say that the modes decouple if the viscosities
are equal. It should not be forgotten that eq. (31) is also
important in the characterization of the interface particle
behaviour and it includes the pressure on each side of the
surface. According to eq. (18), the pressure is associated
with the longitudinal mode and the inertial eﬀect of the
ﬂuid particle according with the density of the media.
Then, it contains the information of each components of
the velocity and also of the density and according to eq.
(26) the pressure has a jump through the interface. This
result, in combination with the analysis of eq. (30) make
diﬃcult to understand the role played by the densities of
each media on the surface polarization movement, and it
can not be reached from this only analysis. This point is
still a matter of investigation.

a Sagittal mode and not with neither a pure longitudi-
nal, nor a pure transversal one. This movement has been
shown to be close related to the physical properties of
the media such as viscosities and that fact allows us to
establish rigorously that those are the parameter which
characterize the interface movement and the response of
each medium to an stimulus coming from the other one.
It was seen that viscosity is the main parameter in
the coupling of the two modes to achieve a Sagittal one,
nevertheless within the framework of this formalism it is
diﬃcult to determine the role of viscosity and of the den-
sity ratios in the coupling of modes. This aspect needs
further investigation.

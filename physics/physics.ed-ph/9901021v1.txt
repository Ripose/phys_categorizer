Abstract

Some facts about 4-spinors listed and discussed. None, well perhaps some, of
the work is original. However, locating formulas in other places has proved a time-
consuming process in which one must always worry that the formulas found in any
given source assume the other metric ( I use {−1, −1, −1, +1}) or assume some other
unexpected preconditions. Here I list some formulas valid in general representations
ﬁrst, then formulas using a chiral representation are displayed, and ﬁnally formulas in
a special reference frame (the rest frame of the ‘current’ j) in the chiral representation
are listed. Some numerical and algebraic exercises are provided.

1 General Representation

We can use any four complex numbers as the components of a 4-spinor in a given represen-
tation, ψ = col{a + bi, c + di, e + f i, g + hi}, where ‘col’ indicates a column matrix and the
eight numbers a...h are real. The 4-spinor generates four real-valued vectors: two light-like,
one time-like and one space-like. These may be deﬁned using the gamma matrices of the
representation as follows:

jµ ≡ ψγµψ ; aµ ≡ ψγµγ5ψ ; rµ ≡ ψγµ

ψ ;

sµ ≡ ψγµ

ψ,

(1)

where ψ ≡ ψ†γ4, µ is one of {1,2,3,4}, and γ5 ≡ −iγ1γ2γ3γ4. Note that the vectors are
representation independent; the substitution γµ → S−1γµS and ψ → S−1ψ doesn’t change
the vectors. By using a speciﬁc representation, perhaps the one displayed below in (3), one
can show after some algebra that (i) r and s are light-like vectors and that (ii) j is time-like
and that (iii) a is space-like. An exception occurs (iv) when r or s is zero; then j and a are
light-like.

Figure 1: The vectors make parallelograms.

Since the gammas in (1) are sandwiched between common factors of ψ and ψ, we see

that the following are true:

jµ = rµ + sµ ; aµ = rµ − sµ ; 2rµ = jµ + aµ ; 2sµ = jµ − aµ.

(2)

The vectors can be arranged in parallelograms, see Fig. 1.

The scalar product of j with itself, j2 ≡ jµjµ, is the same as that for a, aµaµ = −j2,
except for the sign. The two vectors are ‘orthogonal’, jµaµ = 0. We collect scalar products
in Table 1.

2 Chiral Representation [CR]

To get speciﬁc formulas for the vectors in terms of the components of the 4-spinor ψ one
must choose a representation for the gammas. I choose a chiral representation [CR]:

One may check that the gammas (3) satisfy γµγν+ γνγµ = 2gµν · 1, where ‘1’ is the unit 4x4
matrix and gµν = diag{−1, −1, −1, +1} is the 4x4 metric tensor.

Write the 4-spinor ψ as follows

r cos(θR/2) exp(− iφR
r sin(θR/2) exp(+ iφR
l cos(θL/2) exp(− iφL
l sin(θL/2) exp(+ iφL

The given four complex numbers making up the components of ψ determine the eight real
numbers r, θR, φR, l, θL, φL, α, and β, within the usual additive nπ’s. By (1), (3), and (5)
one ﬁnds an expression for j2:

j2 = 2r2l2(1 + cos θR cos θL + cos φR cos φL sin θR sin θL + sin φR sin φL sin θR sin θL). (6)

{s1, s2, s3, s4} = {−l2 sin θL cos φL, −l2 sin θL sin φL, −l2 cos θL, l2}.

[CR]

Clearly the angles θ and φ are polar and azimuthal angles of the spatial directions of r and
s. Speciﬁc formulas for j and a follow immediately from (2), (7), and (8).

With the chiral representation the 4-spinor splits into two 2-spinors, ψ = col{ρ, λ}, where
‘col’ means column matrix. The 2-spinor ρ is right-handed and the other, λ, is left-handed,
referring to their Lorentz transformation properties. By (5), (7), and (8) one sees that the
right 2-spinor ρ determines r and the left 2-spinor λ determines s. The 2x2 rotation matrix
R(κ, ˆn) for a rotation through an angle κ about the direction ˆn is the same for both right and
left 2-spinors, R(κ, ˆn) = exp(−iˆnkσk κ/2). The 2x2 boost matrix B(u, ˆn) for a boost of speed
tanh u in the direction ˆn diﬀers for right and left 2-spinors: BR(u, ˆn) = exp(+ˆnkσk u/2) and
BL(u, ˆn) = exp(−ˆnkσk u/2).

A rotation through an angle κ about the direction ˆn changes the 4-spinor ψ: ψ →
[cos(κ/2) · 1− i sin(κ/2)nkγ5γ4γk]ψ, where ‘1’ is the unit 4x4 matrix. The rotation through
κ about ˆn = {0,0,1} changes {j1, j2} to {cos κj1 − sin κj2, sin κj1 + cos κj2}, leaving j3 and
j4 unchanged.

A boost of speed tanh u in the direction ˆn changes the 4-spinor ψ: ψ → [cosh(u/2) · 1+
sinh(u/2)nkγ4γk]ψ, where ‘1’ is the unit 4x4 matrix. The boost of speed tanh u in the
direction ˆn = {0,0,1} changes {j3, j4} to {cosh uj3 + sinh uj4, sinh uj3 + cosh uj4}, leaving
j1 and j2 unchanged.

3 j-time frame

By applying the appropriate boost (3 parameters: u, ˆn1, ˆn2 which determines ˆn3) we get
a new j which has no spatial components; the new j is in its proper frame. Call this the
‘j-time frame.’ In this frame the spinor has equal right and left 2-spinors within a phase,
ρ = e−iβλ, and the light-like vectors r and s point in opposite directions. The transformed
4-spinor may be written in the form

ψ =

(i) [{θ, φ}] where {θ, φ} are the { polar, azimuthal } angles indicating the direction of r and
a which is opposite to the direction of s. The overall phase is α/2 and the phase shift from
the right 2-spinor to the left 2-spinor is β. The four angles {θ, φ, α, β}, the magnitude of j,
and the three parameters u, ˆn1, ˆn2 of the boost amount to eight real numbers which is the

same number needed to specify the four complex numbers making up a 4-spinor in a given
representation. Thus we still have a general form for the 4-spinor.

(ii) [α] Rotating ψ in the j-time frame, (9), leaves j alone and changes the values of
j2 + (a4)2 with a4 = 0 in this
{θ, φ, α}. If the rotation axis is in the direction of a, ˆnk = ak/
frame, then the eﬀect on α is especially simple: α changes by the negative of the rotation
angle κ, α → α − κ. Rotating by κ = α about a brings α to zero, α → 0. Therefore we may
interpret α, twice the overall phase of ψ in this frame, as a rotation angle.

q

The way this works can be seen as follows. When the direction a is along {1,0,0}, the
angles θ and φ in (9) are θ = π/2 and φ = 0 or π. For φ = 0 the right and left 2-spinors
are given by ρ = λ = exp(iα/2) col{1,1} if we take β = 0 and j = 4. As noted above,
the eﬀect of a rotation is to multiply both ρ and λ by the same 2x2 matrix R(κ, ˆn). The
rotation matrix exp(−iσ1κ/2) for ˆn = {1,0,0} is a linear combination of the Pauli matrix σ1
and the unit 2x2 matrix. But the 2-spinors are eigenspinors of σ1 and the unit 2x2 matrix
with eigenvalue 1, so the eﬀect of the rotation matrix exp(−iσ1κ/2) is to change the phase
of ρ and λ by −κ/2. In short, the two 2-spinors are eigenspinors of the rotation matrix with
the same eigenvalue which is the common phase factor exp(−iκ/2).

For φ = π, the 2-spinor ρ = λ = exp(iα/2) col{-1,1} is an eigenspinor of σ1 with eigenvalue
−1, so the common phase factor is exp(+iκ/2). In Table 2, we collect the change in angles
{θ, φ, α} due to rotations of angle κ about the coordinate axes.

(iii) [β] The phase β is changed, β → β ± κ sign depending on eigenvalue, when the
right-handed 2-spinor ρ is rotated by κ and λ is rotated through −κ, both rotations taking
place about a.
In this case none of the angles {θ, φ, α} changes and the magnitude of j
doesn’t change.

(iv) [j] An operation that changes only the magnitude of j while leaving {θ, φ, α, β} alone
can be found. If the right 2-spinor ρ is boosted along the direction of a by tanh u and λ
is boosted by the same speed but in the opposite direction −a, then the magnitude of j
changes, j → [cosh u − sinh u]j.

Thus the 4-spinor parameters {θ, φ, α} can each be changed by a suitable rotation applied
to ψ, β alone can be changed by applying a counter-clockwise rotation to the right-handed 2-
spinor ρ and the equal clockwise rotation to λ, and the magnitude of j alone can be changed
by boosting ρ forward and boosting λ backward.

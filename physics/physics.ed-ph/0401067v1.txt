Abstract. A procedure to teach Electrodynamics independently of unit systems is
presented and compared with some of those given in physics literature.

1. Introduction

As it is remarked in [1], ”it is a well-known fact that one major hurdle for students in a
class of electromagnetism is to get familiar with the adopted unit system, and to move
from one unit system to another (e.g. SI to Gaussian)”. As a student and, later, as
an Electrodynamics professor, I have felt myself this hurdle. However, inspired by the
Jackson’s book [2], I have adopted a procedure to teach electrodynamics independently
of unit systems since 1985 and used it consistently in my lectures [3]. Here is a summary,
including some comments regarding results from [1, 2] and some inconsistencies from
[3].

2. Writing the Maxwell’s equations

Before writing the Maxwell’s equations we have to deﬁne the physical system itself,
namely the electromagnetic ﬁeld (EMF), by the interactions with other known systems.
The Lorentz force may be experienced for introducing the electric charge q and the
fundamental variables E and B of the EMF. The electric ﬁeld E is deﬁned by the force
acting on a charge at rest in the inertial system of the laboratory. The relation between
force, charge and electric ﬁeld, as is considered in all known unit systems [2] is

F = qE,

such that the introduction of an arbitrary proportional constant in this relation is not
of practical interest. Diﬀerent unit systems are introduced when expressing the Lorentz
force acting on a moving charge q ‡

F = qE +

v × B,

q
α0

(1)

‡ In [3] the magnetic ﬁeld is deﬁned within the old formalism of the magnetic shells or sheets and, the
constant α0 is introduced by the equation of the torque on an elementary shell C = (1/α0)IS × B =
m × B where the magnetic moment is m = (1/α0)IS. From this torque one may deduce the Laplace’s

Here, the constant α0 depends on the unit system used.

The law of electric ﬂux introduces a second constant ke:

or in the local form

E · dS = keQ(D)

∇ · E = keρ.

Amp`ere’s law introduces a third constant km

B · dl = kmI(ΣΓ) or ∇ × B = kmj.

Maxwell’s equation that generalizes the Amp`ere’s law is

Here, the constants ˜ε0 and ˜µ0 are proportional constants, their values depending on the
units used. § The purpose of such deﬁnitions is to write the laws of EM with notations
speciﬁc to the international unit system (SI).

Several arguments justify the equality between α0 and αi. One may argue that

αi = α0

as in Jackson’s book [2], but we may use directly the equation (1) considering a closed
conductor Γ moving with a constant velocity u in an external nonuniform magnetic ﬁeld
B(r) in the laboratory system L. The electromotive force corresponding to the electric
current due to the Lorentz force is [4]

(dl × δa) · B = −

α0 IΓ

δt IΓ

δNm
δt

where δa is the displacement vector of the element dl of the current contour during the
time δt, and δNm is the variation of the magnetic ﬂux Nm through a surface attached
to this contour due to the displacement δa. After comparing the last equation to the
equation (3), and after considering that only the magnetic ﬂux variation is the deﬁning
element of the electromagnetic induction, we have to admit the equality between the
two constants αi and α0.

In [2] this equality is argued theoretically using the Galilei invariance of Maxwell’s
equations for u << c: for the observer in the system L′ of the conductor the eﬀect is
associated with an induced electric ﬁeld

E′ =

1
α0

u × B, (E = 0).

This equation, together with the transformation law B′ = B, is, indeed, the ﬁrst
approximation of the relativistic transformation law.

Another argument for considering the two constants equal is given by the physical
requirements of the EM theory. The deﬁnitions of charge, energy etc must complete
the Maxwell’s equations together with the corresponding theorems resulting from these
equations. Combining the equations (2) and (3) one obtains

requires αi = α0 and deﬁnes the electromagnetic momentum density by

Let’s consider αi = α0 from now on. We point out that the equations are written

using SI units by substituting α0 = 1 , ˜ε0 = ε0, ˜µ0 = µ0. k

The above notations are speciﬁc for rationalized unit systems. To ﬁnd out the
changes required to rewrite the Maxwell’s equations using non rationalized unit systems,
let’s consider the solutions (8) for the scalar and vector potentials. We convert the
Maxwell’s equations (2)-(5) to non rationalized notations by eliminating the factor 1/4π
from (8)

The equation (7) is invariant to these transformations. The Maxwell’s equations with
the notations of a non rationalized unit system are

The Maxwell’s equations (2)-(5) with αi = α0 and all their consequences are
rewritten in all usual unit systems by substituting the following values for the three
constants:

SI:

α0 = 1, ˜ε0 = ε0

, ˜µ0 = µ0

Heaviside: α0 = c, ˜ε0 = ˜µ0 = 1,

These notations work also within the relativistic electrodynamics (in vacuum). The

is the 4-potential. The relativistic invariance of the motion equations and of the
Maxwell’s equations is realized by deﬁning Tµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ as components of a
tensor. In particular, Aµ may be considered as the components of a 4-vector although

this is not a necessary condition of the invariance of the theory, except the request to
have covariant equations for the 4-potential. ¶

As it is pointed out in [2, 1], many diﬃculties are encountered trying to generalize
this procedure to the macroscopic electromagnetic ﬁeld in the presence of a medium.
The complications arise due to some inconsistencies in the deﬁnitions adopted in various
unit systems as it is pointed out in [1].
In [3] one deﬁnes the vectors D and H by the equations

D = ˜ε0E + P , H =

B − M

˜µ0

such that one may obtain the macroscopic Maxwell’s equations only in SI and Heaviside
In [1], the deﬁnitions of D and H are given by introducing two new
unit systems.

However, in [1] a new constant αm (in [1] labeled kM ) is introduced by the relation
between the magnetization current j m and the magnetization vector M

This new constant is not necessary.

Actually, we can reduce the number of

expression is well deﬁned by the Lorentz force. Furthemore, for a steady current loop Γ
we have

We may demonstrate the relation

So, the Laplace’s force is equivalent, at least regarding the resulting force, to a ﬁctitious
force acting on the shell Σ(Γ)

The simplest and natural deﬁnition of the magnetic moment dm corresponding to an
elementary shell is

is presented as a necessary condition for the relativistic invariance of the theory.

Also, it is possible to relate the torque dm × B to the Laplace’s force.[3]. Therefore, in
the case of a current distribution j in D the magnetic dipolar moment is deﬁned by

m =

r × jd3x.

Generally, one may deﬁne the n−th order magnetic moment by the tensor [5]

M(n) =

The magnetization current jm is given by the relation

rn × j d3x.

(9)

jm = α0 ∇ × M

αm = α0

where M includes the contributions of all magnetic multipoles. This is a result of the
deﬁnition (9) and of the average of microscopic equations of EMF. In conclusion, the
equality

is justiﬁed while a third supplementary constant is not necessary in the case of the
macroscopic ﬁeld.

The equations (10) result from the microscopic equations using the relations

,

and the deﬁnitions (11). The following values for the two supplementary constants,
named in [1] conventional constants, should be substituted to obtain the equations
within diﬀerent unit systems. For the two supplementary constants in the usual unit
we have the following expressions:

SI:

αh = 1

Although the number of the conventional constants is reduced to two, the conclusion
from [1] remains valid: the complications due to these conventional constants make the
result ”not as appealing as that obtained in the vacuum case...”.

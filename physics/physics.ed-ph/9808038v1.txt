Abstract

We discuss an elementary problem in electrostatics: What does the charge dis-
tribution look like for a free charge on a strictly one–dimensional wire of ﬁnite

length? To the best of our knowledge this question has so far not been discussed

anywhere. One notices that a solution of this problem is not as simple as it might

appear at ﬁrst sight.

I

Introduction

Some time ago one of the authors of this paper was confronted with the following
question by a student: What does the charge distribution look like for a free charge
on a strictly one–dimensional wire of ﬁnite length, if we consider the usual Coulomb
repulsion law? Despite its rather trivial appearance this problem led to controversial
discussions. The immediate “obvious” answer by most considering the problem for

the ﬁrst time is to suggest a charge distribution like the one in Fig. 1: That is one

intuitively expects an accumulation of charge at the ends of the wire since there is no

repelling charge outside. We urge the reader to make up his mind too before reading

on.

Let us remark that one–dimensional systems of electrons interacting with long–

range Coulomb forces have attracted much attention recently since it has become pos-
sible to realize them experimentally as one–dimensional semiconductor structures 3.
To avoid misunderstandings we want to emphasize that this paper does not aim at

contributing in this direction of research, though this serves as an interesting back-

ground. Quantum eﬀects and the fermionic nature of electrons are not taken into

account here. We rather want to introduce a nice exercise in classical electrostatics

for students or anybody else interested in elementary problems. Only very elementary

tools of mathematics and physics will be used, still at ﬁrst sight the answer might

appear counter–intuitive and surprising.

Let us make one more remark in order to avoid confusion. We do not discuss a

problem in a one–dimensional world, but rather a one–dimensional problem deﬁned

in three–dimensional space. Therefore we use the three–dimensional Coulomb law
−1. Notice that starting from the one–dimensional Laplace equation the

investigated one–dimensional Coulomb gas model that has been solved exactly in the
thermodynamic limit independently by Prager 4 and Lenard 5. Unfortunately the
techniques used in these solutions cannot be carried over to our problem 6 and we have
to rely on other tools in the sequel.

II Regularization prescriptions

Once one starts analyzing the problem, one immediately notices that it is ill–deﬁned

in its original formulation. For simplicity we will assume that the wire has unit length

3

throughout this work: The charge distribution ρ(x) is deﬁned on the interval [0, 1] of

the x–axis. In order to solve our problem we want to minimize the energy functional

We will discuss two obvious possibilities to make the problem well–deﬁned, i.e. ways

to regularize the energy functional (1). It is not immediately clear that both give the

same answer.

(i) Deﬁne the one–dimensional wire to be the limit of ellipsoids in three–dimensional

space when two semiprincipal axes of the ellipsoid shrink to zero. This way we

use a regularization by going to a well–deﬁned problem in the embedding three–

dimensional space, thereby avoiding the singular one–dimensional problem. This

approach is discussed in Sec. III.

(ii) A physically appealing approach is to put n equally charged classical particles
in equilibrium on the wire. Each particle has an individual charge qi = 1/n.
This deﬁnes the looked for charge density in the limit n
. Although this

regularization procedure requires more eﬀort than (i), it is more convincing in

the sense of being a “microscopic” approach. This makes up the main part of

→ ∞

our paper and is worked out in Sec. IV.

Of course other regularization procedures are also possible. A very natural choice

would be

Vd(r) =

since this is usually used for one–dimensional systems interacting with long–range
Coulomb forces 7. The main advantage is that the one–dimensional Fourier transform
of Vd(r) exists for ﬁnite d. However, no exact solution seems possible for ﬁnite d and
it is therefore diﬃcult to investigate the limit d

0.

III Shrinking ellipsoids

Consider the conducting ellipsoid in Fig. 2 with semiprincipal axes a, b and c. One

can argue that for b, c

0 the ellipsoid shrinks to a one–dimensional wire of ﬁnite

length 2a.

→

Now the potential problem of a free charge Q on a conducting ellipsoid has been

well–known for a long time and is treated in many advanced textbooks on electrostatics,
see for example Ref. 1. The explicit solution relies on the fact that the Laplace equation
is separable in elliptic coordinates. Let us simply quote the result for the potential

For our purposes we can assume b = c. One would argue that the total surface charge

in the strip S in Fig. 2 collapses onto the line charge τ (x) dx of the wire at that point x

τ (x) = σ(x)

S(x),

This implies that independent of b the line charge density deﬁned like in Eq. (10) is

constant along the wire

τ (x) =

Q
2a

.

According to this reasoning there are no ﬁnite size eﬀects in our one–dimensional wire
problem: There is no accumulation of charge at the ends of the wire! 8

The sceptical reader can certainly question the validity of this proof by pointing

out that even for inﬁnitesimal b, in some respects the ellipsoid is in no way similar to

a wire. E.g. the ends of the ellipsoid are always much thinner than its middle, and the

smaller available space may compensate a charge accumulation at the ends of the wire.

Therefore we will use a diﬀerent, more microscopic regularization in the next section.

IV Regularization by discretization

We regularize the singular one–dimensional problem by considering n equally charged

classical particles with individual charges 1/n in the interval [0, 1]. Due to Coulomb
repulsion there is a unique equilibrium state with charges at positions xi. In the limit
n
this will deﬁne the continuum charge distribution on the wire that we are

interested in.

IV.1 Upper and lower bounds

First of all we will show that the energy of the discretized problem diverges like ln n
but can still be determined within bounds of width 1
2. This will be done by calculating
an upper and a lower bound for the energy of the equilibrium distribution.

An upper bound is given by the energy Emax of a uniform distribution with charges

at positions xi = (i

Comparing Eq. (23) with the upper bound from Eq. (16) one notices that we have

obtained rather strict limits for the energy of the equilibrium state with minimum

energy. Obviously a uniform distribution cannot be too far from the true equilibrium

solution with minimum energy. That this is indeed true will be shown in the next

section.

IV.2 Rigorous results for the charge distribution

Theorem Suppose the charge distribution ρn(x) for n particles converges for n
towards a continuous distribution ρ(x) deﬁned on ]0, 1[. Then ρ(x) is constant.

→ ∞

Proof: Let us assume that the theorem is wrong and there exist y1, y2 ∈
]0, 1[ with
ρ(y1) > ρ(y2), see Fig. 4. It shall be shown that there exists an N so that for n > N
transferring a particle from y1 to the middle of two particles at y2 results in a decrease
of the energy. Hence the particles were not in equilibrium for n > N and the theorem

is proven.

This can be seen as follows: First of all we regard the energy needed to trans-
ε, y1 + ε] and in
ε, y2 + ε]. Here ε has been chosen so small that both intervals are completely in

fer a particle P from y1 to y2 while neglecting the particles in [y1 −
[y2 −
]0, 1[ and do not overlap. The change of energy is

It is essential to note that Eq. (24) does not contain any term divergent in n, but has
. Let us now calculate the energy ∆E1 of the
a ﬁnite and well-deﬁned limit for n
ε, y1 + ε]. We can
particle P with respect to the other particles in the interval [y1 −

distribution is stable only for ρ(y1) = ρ(y2).

Two remarks are to be made:

•

•

The proof does not say anything about the endpoints of the interval. It can be

shown that if the charge density at the endpoints is well–deﬁned in the continuum

limit, it will obey the inequality ρ(0)

Therefore only potentials with longer range forces than the Coulomb potential

(i.e. potentials with α < 1) can show ﬁnite size eﬀects in the wire problem.

IV.3 Some estimates for the discrete charge distribution

After proving that the continuum charge distribution is ﬂat, let us go back to the dis-

cretized version of the problem. We want to derive some estimates for the distribution

of the charges close to the ends of the wire.

In combination with numerical results

in the next subsection, this will help us to reconcile the somehow counter–intuitive

picture of a ﬂat continuum charge distribution.

We use the same notation as in Sec. IV.1. The distances between particle i and
xi. Then force equilibrium for the second,

particle i + 1 are denoted by di = xi+1 −

Lower bounds can be given too using the ﬁrst equilibrium condition in Eq. (30)

Eq. (36) says that for large n, the distance of the ﬁrst two particles on the wire is

arbitrarily smaller than the distance of two particles in the middle of the wire. Numer-

ical calculations in the next subsection will show that the equality is nearly realized

in Eq. (38). Thus the particles close to the ends of the wire show strong ﬁnite size

10

eﬀects. However, these eﬀects vanish in the continuum limit as we have proved in the

last subsection. This discrepancy is resolved by noticing that the ﬁnite size region

observed in the discretized problem shrinks for n

as will be demonstrated in the

→ ∞

next subsection.

IV.4 Numerical results

In order to gain a better understanding of the problem, we have also used numerical

methods to ﬁnd the equilibrium position of the n particles sitting on the line of unit
length. We have employed the Hybrid Monte–Carlo 9 algorithm that updates the posi-
tions of the individual particles until they ﬁnd their equilibrium positions: The molec-

ular dynamics part of the algorithm moves all particles according to the electrostatic

forces, which are computed only once for all particles at each step. The Monte–Carlo

update scheme ensures that the algorithm is exact, i.e. that equilibrium is reached.

During the simulation, the “temperature” was reduced as the charges moved more and

more closely to their equilibrium positions. Convergence was veriﬁed by checking that

the ground state energy did not decrease any more for additional sweeps within a given

numerical precision. In general, convergence was very quick since the starting point of

the simulation with all particles equidistant is quite “close” to the equilibrium position

for the reasons explained in Sec. IV.2. Simulations with up to n = 8193 particles have

been performed.

The ﬁrst interesting quantity investigated numerically is the ground state energy

E(n) as a function of the number of particles n plotted in Fig. 5. Also drawn are the

upper and lower bounds derived in Eqs. (16) and (23). One notices that the measured

energies seem to settle on the upper bound with good precision for n

. This

raises the interesting (and so far unanswered) question whether the upper bound (16)

→ ∞

becomes the asymptotically exact result for the ground state energy.

Let us also emphasize that the data in Fig. 5 paedagogically demonstrate the danger

→ ∞

of extrapolating to n

based on simulations for ﬁnite n, at least for systems with

long range forces: Extrapolating on the basis of the data for n < 1000 particles the
upper bound would eventually be violated (see the curve in Fig. 5)! Only for more
than 1000 particles the curve for E(n) bends over and the extrapolation respects the
exact results 10.

In Fig. 6 the quotient of the smallest (at one end of the wire) to the largest (in the

middle of the wire) particle distance is plotted as a function of n. The upper bound

11

from Eq. (36) is respected, in particular the interparticle distance at the end of the wire

becomes much smaller than the maximum distance. On the other hand, the ratio of
the distance of the ﬁrst to the second particle d1 and the second to the third particle d2
approaches a constant nonzero value for n
. This is shown in Fig. 7 together

with the lower bound derived in Eq. (38). One clearly sees the strong ﬁnite size eﬀects

→ ∞

already mentioned in the previous subsection.

However, when one looks at the distribution of all charges along the wire plotted

in Fig. 8 for various values of n, one notices that the regions with strong ﬁnite size

eﬀects close to the ends of the wire shrink very slowly with increasing n, probably as

slow as 1/

ln(n), as suggested by Eq. (36). One can interpret these numerical results

as follows: Eventually the continuum charge distribution appears ﬂat, although for

q

a given n the ﬁrst few particles do never approach equidistant positions. But in the

continuum limit n
these non–equidistant regions eventually vanish as compared
to the rest of the wire. This scenario combines the analytical and numerical results
established in this work.

→ ∞

V Summary

We have discussed the seemingly trivial, at least conceptually simple problem of a free

charge on a one–dimensional wire of ﬁnite length. The ﬁrst thing to notice was that

this problem is ill–deﬁned in its original formulation due to the diverging ground state

energy. The question how the continuum charge distribution looks like can only be

answered after introducing some regularization procedure.

Two particularly intuitive regularizations have been employed in this paper; shrink-

ing ellipsoids in Sec. III and charge discretization in Sec. IV. Both led to the answer
that the continuum charge distribution is ﬂat, that is there are no ﬁnite size eﬀects!
The interested reader will be able to ﬁnd other regularization prescriptions that lead

to the same answer.

A ﬂat charge distribution will also be found for potentials

V (x

y)

x

−

∝ |

−

−α

y

|

with shorter range forces than the Coulomb potential, that is generally for α

1.

For exponents α < 1 the problem is well–deﬁned and ﬁnite without the need for

regularization.

It is easy to show that then there are ﬁnite size eﬀects. Thus the

(39)

≥

12

Coulomb law is the limiting case between ﬁnite size eﬀects and no ﬁnite size eﬀects in

a strictly one–dimensional wire of ﬁnite length, see Fig. 9.

One interesting problem left open in this respect is the analytic form of the con-

tinuum charge distribution for exponents α < 1. Another question that we have not

been able to answer is whether the ground state energy as a function of the number of

particles n in Sec. IV is really given by the upper bound Eq. (16) plus subdominant

corrections O(ln n/n). The numerical results in Fig. 5 seem to indicate this.

10The observation that an exact bound would be violated based on our simulations for n < 1000 par-
ticles was the motivation for pushing the simulations to n = 8193. This also demonstrates the dangers
of using numerical simulations without analytical “guidelines”.

An undergraduate level experiment is described to demonstrate the role of probabilistic obser-
vations in physics. A capacitor and a DC voltmeter are used to randomly sample an AC voltage
source. The resulting probability distribution is analyzed to extract information about the AC
source. Diﬀerent characteristic probability distributions arising from various AC waveforms are cal-
culated and experimentally measured. The reconstruction of the AC waveform is demonstrated from
the measured probability distribution under certain restricted circumstances. The results are also
compared with a simulated data sample. We propose this as a pedagogical tool to teach probabilistic
measurements and their manipulations.

INTRODUCTION

Probability is fundamental to physics in more ways
than one. Probabilistic errors can never be avoided in
experimental observations, individual particles and their
initial conditions cannot be tracked in classical physics,
and quantum mechanics, which is the best available de-
scription of nature, is intrinsically probabilistic. While
the basic concepts of probability can be introduced nicely
through coin tossing and probability boards1, they re-
main setups in the realm of statistics without a direct
connection to the physics laboratory. The pedagogy
of probability for physics students has received atten-
tion, with many proposals of statistics-oriented experi-
ments2,3,4,5 and theoretical expositions6,7,8,9, providing
interesting insights. A more physical example of ra-
dioactive decay, a natural random (quantum) process has
also been used to teach and demonstrate probabilistic
ideas10,11,12,13. However, a typical physics laboratory re-
quires more experiments involving probability distribu-
tions and their manipulation. This paper is an eﬀort in
this direction where we describe a simple gadget to study
the manipulation of probability distributions.

Imagine inserting the terminals of a DC voltmeter into
the AC mains outlet. We expect it to display zero be-
cause the DC meter will respond to the average voltage
which in this case is zero. The DC voltmeter is not de-
signed to be sensitive to changes of voltage which oc-
cur at the frequency (50-60Hz) of a typical AC source.
Therefore, the only information we can get from such a
measurement is the average voltage.

How does one measure the instantaneous voltage? We
need to “store” this value for long enough that a DC
voltmeter will be able to read it. One way to do this is
to connect a capacitor across the AC source. The capac-
itor will get charged; the instantaneous voltage across it
will determine the instantaneous charge on the capacitor
plates. When the capacitor is disconnected from the cir-
cuit, the charge and hence the voltage, on the capacitor

remains. This can be seen by joining the two terminals
of the capacitor, whereby a spark is produced. This volt-
age can be measured by a high impedance DC voltmeter.
The DC voltage measured across the capacitor is then the
instantaneous AC voltage of the original source. This DC
voltage is the key variable measured in our experiment.
The experiment can be repeated and a diﬀerent voltage
will be obtained each time! If the observation is repeated
many times, it is indeed a random sampling of the AC
voltage source. This randomly sampled voltage data can
be used to construct the probability distribution of the
voltage. What information about the AC source is con-
tained in this probability distribution? We will see that
the probability distribution depends upon the type of
AC waveform used. A triangular wave for example, will
give rise to a very diﬀerent probability distribution as
compared to a sine wave. Furthermore, under certain re-
stricted circumstances we can reconstruct the waveform
from the voltage probability distribution. We explicitly
demonstrate such a reconstruction for the case of a sine
wave.

The results presented here are an instructive demon-
stration of the role of probabilistic analysis in physics
experiments. The apparatus is simple and cheap. Ele-
mentary C-programs running on an ordinary PC are suf-
ﬁcient to accomplish the data analysis. The data analysis
can also be performed using a graph paper, pencil and
a pocket calculator. Computer analysis is not essential
but is instructive and opens up possibilities of playing
around with various parameters.

The experiment can be introduced in a physics labo-
ratory course at several diﬀerent levels. At the lowest
level the data collected by the procedure described in
section II can be used to demonstrate the zero mean,
maximum and minimum values and the RMS voltage
of an AC source. At the next level of the undergrad-
uate physics laboratory, the analysis of Sections II, III,
and IV can be used to calculate the voltage probability
distribution for diﬀerent parameter values and to recon-
struct the corresponding waveforms. At a more advanced

FIG. 1: The circuit diagram of the experiment. An AC source
is connected to a capacitor C through a switch S which when
pulled disconnects both the terminals of the source from the
capacitor. The capacitor voltage is continuously monitored
through a DC voltmeter V. When the source is connected the
DC meter shows zero voltage and when the source is discon-
nected the DC meter shows a random voltage which decays
as the capacitor begins to discharge through the voltmeter.

level, the statistical analysis of section V and simulations
can be carried out with the help of computer programs
(available in Numerical Recipes14) to bring out the quan-
titative statistical aspects of the experiment.

The material in this paper is arranged as follows. In
section II we describe the experimental apparatus. Sec-
tion III provides a theoretical analysis of probability dis-
tributions arising from a random sampling of voltages
and waveform reconstruction from such a probability dis-
tribution. Section IV describes the experimental mea-
surement with AC waveform and the data analysis. In
Section V we compare the results of our experiments with
data obtained from a simulation. The C-program used
for the data analysis in Section IV is provided in the
Appendix . Section VI contains a short discussion and
conclusions.

tion of the voltage developed across the capacitor. The
measurement proceeds as follows: the switch is kept in
place to ensure that the DC voltmeter shows zero voltage.
This happens because the AC is oscillating too rapidly for
the DC meter to be able to follow the voltage. Then the
switch is pressed to disconnect the AC source and at this
stage the voltmeter shows the instantaneous DC voltage
across the capacitor. The maximum value shown on the
meter is recorded. This voltage is our main observation.
The voltage across the capacitor will decay slowly as it
discharges through the voltmeter. We are not interested
in this decay. The switch is pressed a second time to
reconnect the AC source. This completes one measure-
ment cycle. To repeat the observation, at some stage the
switch is pressed again and the maximum voltage devel-
oped across the capacitor is recorded. The experiment is
repeated several times and a list of voltages is generated.
This is our basic data set from which we want to draw
our conclusions.

It is useful to have two students recording the data;
one presses the switch and the other records the maxi-
mum voltage on the voltmeter. In some voltmeters the
voltage ﬁrst rises and then begins to fall. To a good
approximation we take the maximum voltage to be the
instantaneous voltage across the capacitor. An ideal volt-
meter will not have this problem; however, no instrument
is ideal so there is always a ﬁnite measurement time over
which the voltage across the voltmeter builds up from
zero. To accurately measure the voltage across the ca-
pacitor is an interesting exercise in itself; the best way is
to actually measure the charge accumulated on the capac-
itor using a sensitive device like a ballistic galvanometer.
It will be interesting to develop newer instruments which
can be used in undergraduate laboratories and which can
measure charge to a good accuracy. However, for our ex-
periment such precise measurement of voltage across the
capacitor is not required. We now turn to the theoret-
ical analysis of random sampling and probability distri-
butions.

III. THEORY

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental setup consists of a capacitor, a volt-
meter, an AC source and a double pole switch. The volt-
meter is connected across the capacitor which is in turn
connected to the source through the switch. The switch
when pressed disconnects the source from the capacitor.
At this instant the capacitor begins to discharge through
the voltmeter. Upon pressing the switch a second time,
the source is reconnected to the capacitor. The voltmeter
remains connected across the capacitor throughout. A
good digital voltmeter with high internal resistance and
small capacitance should be used. The circuit diagram is
shown in Figure 1.

This arrangement is suﬃcient to sample the distribu-

Consider a time-dependent observable quantity, say a
voltage f (t). If we measure this voltage N random times
in an interval, 0 < t < T , we can determine the distribu-
tion function n(V ), the number of times the measurement
of f results in a value between V and V +∆V . We denote
the corresponding probability distribution of values of f
by P (V ),

Given f (t), what is P (V )? Consider a measurement of
f being done between t and t + ∆t. The measured value
V , will be between f (t) and f (t + ∆t). i.e., between f (t)

and f (t) +

B. Wave form reconstruction

Having determined the probability distribution P (V ),
the question now is, given P (V ), what can we say about
f (t)? In general, it is not possible to reconstruct f (t)
from P (V ) since many functions can have the same prob-
ability distribution of values. However, as we will see,
with some additional information about the function, it
is possible to reconstruct it.

We ﬁrst consider the case when f (t) is a one-to-one and
hence invertible function. We denote the inverse of f by
f −1, so that t = g(V ). Let Pt(t) be the probability
g
that a measurement is done between t and t + dt, then,

≡

P (V )dV = Pt(t)dt

(16)

where t is the time when the voltage is equal to V . From
now, we will restrict ourselves to uniform distributions
for the random measurements, i.e.,

(17)

We also have

We now need some additional information about f (t). If
f (t) is one-to-one, then it is monotonic. Assume that it
is monotonically increasing. We can then integrate the
above equation to get g(V ),

FIG. 3: Plot of 500 voltages plotted with the measurement
number appearing along the x-axis. The AC source used here
had a peak voltage of 8.6V.

Another situation where f (t) can be reconstructed is
if we are given that it is a periodic function with period
Tp, has exactly one minimum (and hence one maximum)
in a period and is symmetric about its maximum and
minimum. A sinusoidal waveform which we use for our
experiment is an example of such a function.
In this
case, we know that it monotonically increases for half the
period and monotonically decreases for the other half of
the period. Furthermore, if we are sampling over times
large compared to the time period, then we randomly
sample all the times in a period. So we can replace T by
the half-period 1
2 Tp in all the above formulae, reconstruct
f (t) for the half period and then using the symmetry,
recover the function for the full period. We can get to
the wave shape from the probability distribution in this
case; however, we are unable to ﬁnd the signal frequency.

IV. RESULTS

We now turn to the experimental results and their
analysis. For good statistics, a large number of voltages
should be recorded, although interesting results begin to
emerge with a sample size as low as 100. The results in
this section pertain to a sample size of 500 data points
with a 50Hz AC source having a peak voltage of 8.6V.
The 500 raw data points (used in the analysis) are shown
in Figure 3. The raw data clearly look random and it is
not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions by mere
visual inspection.

The ﬁrst step in the analysis is to choose a certain
number of bins and ﬁnd the probability distribution of
voltage. This is achieved by the C program given in
Appendix . In Figure 4 we show the graph corresponding
to the probability distribution for the voltages divided
into 101 uniform bins.

Furthermore, since the function in this case satisﬁes

dom, do not give us any time-scale information; hence
the reconstruction gives us only the shape of the signal.
For example, two sine waves with diﬀerent frequencies
and same amplitudes will give the same probability dis-
tribution and hence the same reconstructed waveforms.
It is instructive to play with the parameters of the ex-
periment. Diﬀerent frequency and amplitude for the AC
can be tried and the experiment can be repeated with
diﬀerent waveforms like triangular or saw tooth and oth-
ers. One can change the total number of points in the
raw data and see how the statistics improves by increas-
ing the sample points, which will be taken up in the next
section. For the data analysis the number of bins is the
only crucial parameter and it is interesting to see how the
quality of analysis changes as we change the bin size. As
a demonstration, we re-analyze the same data described
above by varying the number of bins to 11 and 1001. One
observes (see Figs. 5 and 6) that 11 bins a give much less
accurate probability distribution and waveform; however
going to 1001 bins does not help much compared to 101
bins.

The 101 bins are able to capture more information
available in the data compared to 11 bins, leading to the
improved quality of the result. Since the raw data has
only 500 points, there is a limit to which we can improve
the quality by increasing the bin number. If we want to
improve the results further we must increase the num-
ber of raw data points and not the bin number. This is
a general principle of experimental observations wherein
the accuracy of the result is determined by the least ac-
curate part of the observation and analysis.

FIG. 4: Probability distribution and reconstructed wave-
form from 500 data points using 101 voltage bins.
In the
upper graph we show the probability distribution which is
calculated by dividing the fraction of voltages belonging to a
bin by the width of the bin. In the lower graph the dotted
curve corresponds to the reconstructed voltage as a function
of time in arbitrary units (no frequency information is recov-
erable). The solid curve is the actual sine curve provided for
comparison.

the conditions for reconstruction, we use the formula
given in Eqn. 19 and numerical integration (carried out
by the second part of the C program given in Appendix )
for waveform reconstruction and display the results in the
lower half of Figure 4. The expected sinusoidal waveform
emerges. The actual sine curve is also provided as a solid
curve in the same graph for comparison. If we start with
a larger raw data set we can improve the quality of recon-
struction and also reduce the statistical ﬂuctuation in the
probability distribution plot. A detailed statistical anal-
ysis is presented in Section V. We observe here that the
probability distribution reveals the characteristics of the
waveform which are not at all obvious from the raw data.
We note here that there is no way of estimating the
frequency of the signal. The sampling times, being ran-

As seen in the preceding section, the data when anal-
ysed ﬁt well into a sinusoidal curve, reproducing the orig-
inal voltage form. We now analyse the goodness of this
ﬁt and deviations from the expected (theoretical) values.
When a sinusoidal waveform is sampled N times ran-
domly, the voltage probability distribution of Eqn. (15)
results in the frequency distribution of events

n(V ) = N P (V )dV

The plots clearly indicate that there is a loss of information
if we use too few bins for the data analysis.

FIG. 6: Probability distribution and reconstructed waveform
for the same data set with 1001 voltage bins. There is hardly
any improvement from the 101 bin analysis indicating that
there is no advantage in increasing the bin size beyond a point.

The N data are binned into m bins; assuming that
each sample is a random independent event, the statisti-
cal error for the frequency in each bin can be taken to be
N/m. Thus the error on NV is σj = √jσ0, where
σ0 =
there are j bins from V = 0 to V = V . With this error,
the accumulated frequency NV is ﬁtted to the form in
Eqn. (21), with V0 as the free parameters, by a standard

Note that due to switching losses, the largest value
of sampled voltage in the ﬁrst case was 8.3 V and in
the latter, 16.4 V. Clearly, switching losses are larger

lower peak voltages.

We now turn our attention to a numerical simulation.
Two sets of data were simulated (both with V0 = 8.3V),
one with 500 sample events (as in the actual experimen-
tal data) and one with twenty times as much data, by
sampling a sine waveform randomly. The simulated data
were binned and analysed as above. The larger data set
was scaled suitably for comparison with the smaller sam-
ple/experimental data.

a peak voltage Vpeak = 8.6V. Histograms I (solid lines), II
(dotted lines) correspond to the experimental data and simu-
lations with 500 samples respectively; histogram III (shifted
by 50 along the y-axis for clarity) is for 10,000 samples. The
solid lines correspond to the theoretical frequency distribution
as given by Eqn. (20)

The accumulated frequency for the data/simulated
data are shown as a function of the voltage in Fig. 8
for the three cases. (The results for III have been scaled
down (by 20) to match the overall normalisation for the
other two cases.) While ﬂuctuations in the simulated
data for 500 samples (Case II) are similar to the exper-
imental data, the ﬂuctuations for the large data sample
(Case III) are very small and the corresponding distribu-
tion is very smooth. The resulting χ2 is therefore much
smaller in this case, as Table II shows. Furthermore, the
goodness-of-ﬁt is much better for II than for I, although
they correspond to similar sample sizes. This may reﬂect

FIG. 8:
Integrated frequency, NV , shown as a function of
voltage V, in 91 bins, with errorbars. The solid lines are the
best ﬁts to the data, I: experimental data with V0 = 8.3V ,
generated by sampling AC voltage from a transformer with a
peak voltage of 8.6 V. II: simulated data with same V0 and
number of sample points (500) as data, III: simulated data
with 10,000 sample points. Set II (III) has been shifted by
100 (200) along the y-axis for clarity.

In summary, data with smaller voltages at the trans-
former give better ﬁts to the original sine waveform than
data with larger voltages. As expected, the quality of ﬁt
improves with amount of data.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

A simple experiment was constructed to randomly
sample an AC voltage source. The crux of the experiment

involved charging a capacitor from an AC source, whose
instantaneous voltage is then measured by switching its
connection to a DC voltmeter at a random time. The re-
sulting data were analysed to recover information about
the AC source. While the frequency of the source could
not be determined, the peak voltage and the shape of the
original waveform could be accurately found. The pro-
cedure involved in inverting the data to recover this in-
formation was tested through numerical simulations and
statistical analysis. The experiment, along with the anal-
ysis, can be eﬀectively introduced into a physics labora-
tory course at the primary or advanced level. The eﬀects

8

of changing the switching device (to limit losses due to
sparking, etc.), the peak voltage of the AC source, and
the voltage measuring device, can be studied at various
levels of complexity, depending on the ability and incli-
nation of the reader.

APPENDIX: C PROGRAM

We give here the C program used for the data analysis. The input to the program is a data ﬁle ‘input.dat’ which
should have a single column containing the voltages measured in the experiment. The program scans the ﬁle, ﬁnds the
data attributes (number of data points, the maximum value in the data, the average voltage, etc.) and writes them
in the ﬁle ‘cap1.out’. It then divides the voltage range into equal sized odd number of bins. The bin number is to be
speciﬁed on the screen and is read as the variable bin_nu. The binned data is written into the ﬁle ‘cap2.out’ with
the ﬁrst column containing the bin center and the second the probability of occurrence of voltage in that bin. The
second part of the program carries out the waveform reconstruction for the periodic signal and the result is written
in the ﬁle ‘cap3.out’ where the ﬁrst column contains the ‘scaleless’ time variable and the second column the voltage
reconstructed for that time.

INTEGRATION OF THE DATA
This part of the program integrates the data and reconstructs the waveform assuming that f (t) can be reconstructed
from the values of f (t) in the interval [0, T /2) (where T is the period of f (t)) in the following way: f (T /2 + t) =
f (T /2

t) 0 < t < T /2. The output is written in a ﬁle ‘cap3.out’

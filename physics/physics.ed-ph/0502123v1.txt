Analysis of the radio-metric tracking data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft at distances
between 20–70 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun has consistently indicated the presence of an
anomalous, small, constant Doppler frequency drift. The drift is a blue-shift, uniformly changing at
the rate ˙ν ∼ (5.99 ± 0.01) × 10−9 Hz/s. The signal also can be interpreted as a constant acceleration
−8 cm/s2 directed towards the Sun. This interpretation has become known
of aP = (8.74 ± 1.33) × 10
as the Pioneer anomaly.

The nature of this anomaly remains unexplained. That is to say, up to now no unambiguous
explanation of the anomalous signal has been found. To reach this conclusion a complicated interplay
between experiment and theory is needed to rule out systematics. However, in the end many of the
necessary calculations are amenable to students. To elucidate this students would have a deeper
understanding of the workings of physics in space systems. We give a problem set devoted to this
cause.

INTRODUCTION

The Pioneer 10/11 missions, launched on 2 March 1972
(Pioneer 10) and 4 December 1973 (Pioneer 11), were the
ﬁrst to explore the outer solar system. After Jupiter and
(for Pioneer 11) Saturn encounters, the two spacecraft
followed escape hyperbolic orbits near the plane of the
ecliptic to opposite sides of the solar system. (The hy-
perbolic escape velocities are 12.5 km/s for Pioneer 10
and 11.6 km/s for Pioneer 11.) Pioneer 10 eventually be-
came the ﬁrst man-made object to leave the solar system.
(See Figure 1 for a perspective of the orbits and Tables
I and II for more details. The orbital parameters for the
craft are given in Appendix A.)

The Pioneers were excellent craft with which to per-
form precise celestial mechanics experiments. This was
due to a combination of many factors, including their
attitude control (spin-stabilized, with a minimum num-
ber of attitude correction maneuvers using thrusters),
power design (the Plutonium-238 radioactive heat-source
RTGs being on extended booms aided the stability of the
craft and also reduced the heat systematics), and precise
Doppler tracking (with sensitivity to resolve small fre-
quency drifts at the level of mHz/s). The result was the
most precise navigation in deep space to date. (See Fig-
ure 2 for a design drawing of the spacecraft.)

By 1980 Pioneer 10 had passed a distance of

20 AU

evident. Subsequent analysis of the radio-metric track-
ing data from the Pioneer 10/11 spacecraft at distances

dicated the presence of an anomalous, small, constant

tory explanation of the anomalous signal has been found.

(To be precise, the data analyzed in Ref.
[1] was taken
between 3 January 1987 and 22 July 1998 for Pioneer
10 (when the craft was 40 AU to 70.5 AU distant from
the Sun) while that from Pioneer 11 and was obtained
between 5 January 1987 and 1 October 1990 for Pioneer
11 (22.4 to 31.7 AU).)

Although the most obvious explanation would be that
there is a systematic origin to the eﬀect, perhaps gen-
erated by the spacecraft themselves from excessive heat
or propulsion gas leaks, none has been found. That is,
attempts to ﬁnd a convincing explanation using such a
mechanism have not succeeded because no unambigu-
ous, onboard systematic origin has been discovered [1, 2].
This inability to explain the anomalous acceleration of
the Pioneer spacecraft with conventional physics has con-
tributed to a growing discussion about its origin.

Attempts to verify the anomaly using other spacecraft
have proven disappointing [1, 2, 3, 4]. This is because the

they will have signiﬁcant on-board systematics that mask
the anomaly (i.e., JIMO – Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter).

The acceleration regime in which the anomaly was ob-
served diminishes the value of using modern disturbance
compensation systems for a test. For example, the sys-
tems that are currently being developed for the LISA and
LISA Pathﬁnder missions, are designed to operate in the
presence of a very low frequency acceleration noise (at
the mHz level), while the Pioneer anomalous accelera-
tion is a strong constant bias in the Doppler frequency
data. In addition, currently available DC accelerometers

are a few orders of magnitude less sensitive than is need
for a test. Furthermore, should the anomaly be a ﬁcti-
tious force that universally aﬀects frequency standards
[1], the use of accelerometers will shed no light on what
is the true nature of the observed anomaly.

Finally, a comprehensive test of the anomaly requires
an escape hyperbolic trajectory [1, 2, 3]. This makes a
number of advanced missions (i.e., LISA – the Laser In-
terferometric Space Antenna, STEP – the Space Test of
Equivalence Principle, LISA Pathﬁnder) less able to test
properties of the detected anomalous acceleration. Al-
though these missions all have excellent scientiﬁc goals
and technologies, nevertheless, because of their orbits
they will be in a less advantageous position to conduct a
precise test of the detected anomaly. These observations
and analyses of the capabilities of other spacecraft cur-
rently in operation or in design led to the conclusions that
none could perform an independent veriﬁcation of the
anomaly and that a dedicated test is called for [3, 4, 5, 6].

As the Pioneer anomaly has remained unexplained,
widespread (even public) interest in it has grown. One
result was that Catherine Mignard of the Observatoire
de Nice inquired if a problem set could be created on
the Pioneer anomaly for the students of the University of
Nice, France. The aims were to excite and engage them,

and also to show them by example how research really
works. As a byproduct one would ﬁnally show them that
they, too, could take part and understand. The present
Problem Set is the result of the inquiry.

To start we present a few simple calculations that on
the physical situation. Speciﬁcally, these ﬁrst exercises
are designed to give an intuition into the dynamics of
the problem. In them one can use the approximation of
ignoring the angular momentum in the hyperbolic orbits,
treating the velocities as radial.

Problem 1.1: Given the orbital parameters of Pio-
neer 10 on 1 January 2005 (distance r0 and velocity v0)
in Table II, and assuming that there were no anomaly,
what would be the ﬁnal velocity of Pioneer 10?

Solution 1.1: Using the velocity, v0, and distance,
r0, from Table II, the terminal escape velocity can be
calculated from the conservation of energy equation

v∞ =

2GM⊙/r0 = 11.38 km/s.

Problem 1.2: On the other hand, presume that the
anomaly continues on as a constant. At what distance
from the Sun would the acceleration of the anomaly be
equal to that of gravity?

Solution 1.2: By simply equating the anomalous

and gravitational forces one ﬁnds

d= =

GM⊙/aP ∼

2, 600 AU.

Problem 1.3: Assume the anomaly is due to a phys-
ical force. The time period over which the Pioneer 10
data was analyzed was 11.5 years (1987.0 to 1998.5).

Because of the anomaly, approximately what is the
shortfall in distance which Pioneer 10 traveled during
the data period?

Solution 1.3: Using this data interval, simple me-

chanics yields

∆d =

57, 500 km.

Problem 1.4:

If the anomaly were to continue as a
constant out to deep space and were due to a force, how
far will Pioneer 10 travel before it reaches zero velocity
and starts to fall back in to the Sun? How long will this
take?

Solution 1.4: As seen in Problem 1.1, in deep space
the gravitational potential energy due to the Sun is small
compared to the kinetic energy of Pioneers. Therefore,
one can ignore it with respect to the kinetic energy
needed to be turned into anomaly potential energy. (This
approximation slightly overestimates the time and dis-
tance.) Using the data from Table II, the time is found
by solving for

vf = 0 = v0 −

aP t.

The solution is t = 2.40
distance traveled would be given by

This would be well on its way to Aldebaran. (See Table
I.) Since this distance is so large compared to r0 = 87.06
AU, this veriﬁes the validity of the approximation of ig-
noring the gravitational potential energy.

In what follows we concentrate on the error analysis
that demonstrated the existence of the anomaly in the
data. In Section II we will consider sources of systematic
error external to the spacecraft. Section III will deal with
the sources of systematic error internal to the spacecraft.
We will discuss computational systematics in Section IV
and will summarize the error budget in Section V.

II.

SOURCES OF SYSTEMATIC ERROR

EXTERNAL TO THE SPACECRAFT

External forces can produce three vector components
of spacecraft acceleration. This is unlike forces generated
on board the Pioneers, since the two non-radial com-
ponents (i.e., those that are eﬀectively perpendicular to
the spacecraft spin) are canceled out by spacecraft ro-
tation. However, non-radial spacecraft accelerations are

4

diﬃcult to observe by the Doppler technique, which mea-
sures spacecraft velocity along the Earth-spacecraft line
of sight. Although one could in principle set up com-
plicated engineering models to predict all or each of the
systematics, often the uncertainty of the models is too
large to make them useful, despite the signiﬁcant eﬀort
required. A diﬀerent approach is to accept our ignorance
about these non-gravitational accelerations and assess to
what extent they can be assessed to be a bias over the
time scales of all or part of the missions.

In this section we will discuss possible systematics (in-
cluding forces) generated external to the spacecraft which
might signiﬁcantly aﬀect the navigation of the Pioneers
10 and 11. These start with true forces due to (1) solar-
radiation pressure and (2) solar wind pressure. We go on
to discuss (3) the eﬀect of the solar corona, (4) electro-
magnetic Lorentz forces, and (5) the phase stability of
the reference atomic clocks.

Problem 2.1: There is an exchange of momentum
when solar photons impact the spacecraft and are either
absorbed or reﬂected. There are models that take into ac-
count various parts of the spacecraft exposed to solar ra-
diation, primarily the high-gain antenna. They compute
an acceleration directed away from the Sun as a function
of spacecraft orientation and solar distance. The eﬀect of
the solar radiation pressure depends on the optical prop-
erties of the spacecraft surface (i.e. its absorptivities and
emissivities), and eﬀective areas of spacecraft parts pa-
rameters which, although modeled by design, are deter-
mined by calibration early in the mission. The eﬀect can
be distinguished from gravity’s 1/r2 law because the di-
rection between the Sun and eﬀective spacecraft surface
varies. For navigational purposes, one determines the
magnitude of the solar-pressure acceleration at various
orientations using Doppler data.

Estimate the systematic error from solar-radiation
pressure on the Pioneer 10 spacecraft over the interval
from 40 to 70.5 AU, and for Pioneer 11 over the interval
from 22.4 to 31.7 AU.

f⊙ = 1367 W/m2(AU)2 is the (eﬀective-temperature

seen by the Sun. For the Pioneers the area was taken
to be the antenna dish of radius 1.37 m. (See Figure 2
for more information.) θ is the angle between the axis of
the antenna and the direction of the Sun (the solar pres-
sure eﬀect can be distinguished from gravity’s 1/r2 law
because cos θ varies). c is the speed of light. m is taken

of the data yielded

K0 = 1.71.
Because of the 1/r2 law, by the time the craft reached
10−8
10 AU the solar radiation acceleration was 18.9
cm/s2 going down to 0.39 of those units by 70 AU. Since
this systematic falls oﬀ as r−2, it can bias the Doppler
determination of a constant acceleration at some level.
By taking the average of the r−2 acceleration curves over
the Pioneer distance intervals, one can estimate that the
systematic error from solar-radiation pressure, in units
of 10−8 cm/s2, is 0.001 for Pioneer 10 over the interval
from 40 to 70.5 AU, and 0.006 for Pioneer 11 over the
interval from 22.4 to 31.7 AU.

Problem 2.2: Estimate the eﬀect of the solar wind
on the Pioneer spacecraft. How signiﬁcant is it to the
accuracy of the Pioneers’ navigation?

Solution 2.2: The acceleration caused by the solar
wind has the same form as Eq. (6), with f⊙ replaced by
5 cm−3 is the proton density at 1 AU
mpv3n, where n

Because the density can change by as much as 100%, the
exact acceleration is unpredictable. Even if one makes
the very conservative assumption that the solar wind con-
tributes only 100 times less force than the solar radiation,
its smaller contribution is completely negligible.

Problem 2.3: Both range and Doppler observations
at S-band (frequency ν0 = 2295 MHz) are aﬀected by
the electron density in the outer solar corona. Indeed,
both the electron density and density gradient in the so-
lar atmosphere inﬂuence the propagation of radio waves
through the medium. So, both range and Doppler obser-
vations at S-band are aﬀected by the electron density in
the interplanetary medium and outer solar corona. Since,
throughout the experiment, the closest approach to the
center of the Sun of a radio ray path was greater than 3.5
R⊙, the medium may be regarded as collisionless. The
one way time delay associated with a plane wave passing
through the solar corona is obtained by integrating the
group velocity of propagation along the ray’s path, ℓ:

where ne(t, r) is the free electron density in the solar
plasma, c is the speed of light, and ncrit(ν) is the critical
plasma density for the radio carrier frequency ν. The
plus sign is applied for ranging data and the minus sign
for Doppler data.

Therefore, in order to calibrate the plasma contribu-
tion, one should know the electron density along the

5

path. One usually decomposes the electron density, ne,
into a static, steady-state part, ne(r), plus a ﬂuctuation
δne(t, r), i.e., ne(t, r) = ne(r) + δne(t, r). The physical
properties of the second term are hard to quantify. But
luckily, its eﬀect on Doppler observables and, therefore,
on our results is small. On the contrary, the steady-
state corona behavior is reasonably well known and sev-
eral plasma models can be found in the literature.

Consequently, while studying the eﬀect of a system-
atic error from propagation of the S-band carrier wave
through the solar plasma, both analyses adopted the fol-
lowing model for the electron density proﬁle:

tracking link being modeled. The parameters A, B, C are
parameters chosen to describe the solar electron density.

cm−3.)

Solution 2.4: The Doppler correction is obtained
from Eq. (10) by simple time diﬀerentiation. (The im-
pact parameter depends on time as ρ = ρ(t) and may be
expressed via the relative velocity of the spacecraft with
respect to the Earth, v
30 km/s). Use the physical
model of Eq. (10) for the steady-state solar corona eﬀect
on the radio-wave propagation through the solar plasma.
The eﬀect of the solar corona is expected to be small for
Doppler and large for range. The time-averaged eﬀect of
the corona on the Doppler is found to be small, of order
σcorona =

10−8 cm/s2, as might be expected.

Problem 2.5: The possibility that the Pioneer
spacecraft could hold a charge, and be deﬂected in its
trajectory by Lorentz forces, was a concern for the mag-

Gauss). This is about a factor of 105 times smaller than
the magnetic ﬁeld strengths measured by the Pioneers
at their nearest approaches to Jupiter: 0.185 Gauss for
Pioneer 10 and 1.135 Gauss for the closer in Pioneer 11.
Further, data from the Pioneer 10 plasma analyzer can
be interpreted as placing an upper bound of 0.1 µC on

Problem 2.6: Long-term frequency stability tests
are conducted with the exciter/transmitter subsystems
and the DSN’s radio-science open-loop subsystem. An
uplink signal generated by the exciter is translated at
the antenna to a downlink frequency. The downlink
signal is then passed through the RF-IF downconverter
present at the antenna and into the radio science receiver
chain. This technique allows the processes to be syn-
chronized in the DSN complex based on the frequency
standards whose ”Allan deviations” are of the order of
10−15 for integration time in the range from
σy ∼
10 s to 103 s. (The ”Allan deviation” is the variance in
the relative frequency ﬂuctuation, deﬁned as y = ∆ν/ν,
σν /ν. See the discussion of Allan deviation in
or σy ≃
Appendix B.) For the S-band frequencies of the Pioneers,
the corresponding variances are 1.3

The inﬂuence of the clock stability on the detected
acceleration, aP , can be estimated based on the re-
ported variances for the clocks, σy. The standard ‘sin-
gle measurement’ error on acceleration is derived from
the time derivative of the Doppler frequency data as
(cσy)/τ , where the variance, σy, is calculated for 1000
s Doppler integration time and τ is the signal averaging
time. This formula provides a good rule of thumb when
the Doppler power spectral density function obeys a 1/f
ﬂicker-noise law, which is approximately the case when
plasma noise dominates the Doppler error budget. As-
sume a worst case scenario, where only one clock was used
for the whole 11 year study. To estimate the inﬂuence
of that one clock on the reported accuracy of the de-
tected anomaly aP , combine σy = ∆ν/ν0, the fractional
Doppler frequency shift from the reference frequency of
2.29 GHz, with the estimate for the variance,
ν0 =
10−12. This yields a number that characterizes
σy = 1.3
the upper limit for a frequency uncertainty introduced in
a single measurement by the instabilities in the atomic
10−3 Hz for a 103 Doppler
clock: σν = ν0σy = 2.98
integration time.

×

×

∼

Solution 2.6:

Derive an estimate for the total eﬀect of phase and fre-
quency stability of clocks to the Pioneer anomaly value.
(Note that the observed aP corresponds to a frequency
drift of about 0.2 Hz/year.) How signiﬁcant is this eﬀect?
In order to derive an estimate for the
total eﬀect, recall that the Doppler observation technique
is essentially a continuous count of the total number
of complete frequency circles during observational time.
Within a year one can have as many as N
3, 150 in-
dependent single measurements of the clock with dura-
103 seconds. This yields an upper limit for the
tions
contribution of atomic clock instability on the frequency
10−5 Hz/year. Noting
drift of σclock = σν /√N
that the observed aP corresponds to a frequency drift of
about 0.2 Hz/year, means that the error in aP is about
0.0003

10−8 cm/s2, which is completely negligible.

III. SOURCES OF SYSTEMATIC ERROR
INTERNAL TO THE SPACECRAFT

In this section forces generated by on-board spacecraft
systems that could contribute to the discovered constant
acceleration, aP , are considered. The on-board mecha-
nisms discussed are: (1) the radio beam reaction force,
(2) RTG heat reﬂecting oﬀ the spacecraft, (3) diﬀeren-
tial emissivity of the RTGs, (4) expelled Helium produced

Problem 3.2:

It has been argued that the anoma-
lous acceleration seen in the Pioneer spacecraft is due to
anisotropic heat reﬂection oﬀ of the back of the spacecraft
high-gain antennae, the heat coming from the RTGs. Be-
fore launch, the four RTGs had a total thermal fuel in-
ventory of 2580 W (
2070 W in 2002). They produced
65 W in 2002). (In
a total electrical power of 160 W (
Table III a description of the overall power system is
2000 W of RTG heat still had
given.) Thus, by 2002
to be dissipated. Since only
63 W of directed power
could have explained the anomaly, in principle there was
enough power to explain the anomaly this way.

The main bodies of the RTGs are cylinders and they
are grouped in two packages of two. Each package has
the two cylinders end to end extending away from the
antenna. Every RTG has six ﬁns separated by equal an-
gles of 60 degrees that go radially out from the cylinder.
Approximate dimensions for the RTGs are: the cylinder
and ﬁn lengths are 28.2 and 26.0 cm (11.06 and 10.24 in),
the radius of the central RTG cylinder is 8.32 cm (3.315
in), and the RTG ﬁn width is 17.0 cm as measured from
the surface of the cylinder to the outer ﬁn-tip is 17.0 cm
(6.685 in). (See Figure 3.)

7

The RTGs are located at the end of booms, and ro-
tate about the spacecraft in a plane that contains the
approximate base of the antenna. From the closest ax-
ial center point of the RTGs, the antenna is seen nearly
“edge on” (the longitudinal angular width is 24.5◦). The
total solid angle subtended is
1-2% of 4π steradians.
A more detailed calculation yields a value of 1.5%.

∼

Estimate the contribution of the RTG heat reﬂecting
oﬀ the spacecraft to the Pioneer anomaly. Can one ex-
plain the seen anomaly with this mechanism? Use the
spacecraft geometry and the resultant RTG radiation
pattern.

Solution 3.2: There are two reasons that preclude

this mechanism:

i) The spacecraft geometry:

Even taking the
higher bound of 2% of π steradians solid angle being the
fraction of solid angle covered by the antenna, the equiv-
alent fraction of the RTG heat could provide at most

∼

40 W.
ii) The RTGs’ radiation pattern: The above es-
timate was based on the assumption that the RTGs are
spherical black bodies. But they are not. Presumably
this results in a symmetrical radiation of thermal power
into space.

∼

The ﬁns are “edge on” to the antenna (the ﬁns point
perpendicular to the cylinder axes). The largest opening
angle of the ﬁns is seen only by the narrow-angle parts
of the antenna’s outer edges. Ignoring these edge eﬀects,
2.5% of the surface area of the RTGs is facing
only
the antenna. This is a factor 10 less than that from
integrating the directional intensity from a hemisphere:
h.sph. dΩ cos θ)/(4π)] = 1/4. So, one has only 4 W of
[(
directed power.

This suggests a systematic bias of

10−8 cm/s2.
Even adding an uncertainty of the same size yields a sys-
tematic for heat reﬂection of

0.55

10−8 cm/s2.

(16)

Finally, if this mechanism were the cause, ultimately
an unambiguous decrease in the size of aP should be seen
because the RTGs’ radioactively produced radiant heat
is decreasing. As noted previously, the heat produced is
now about 80% of the original magnitude. In fact, one
10−8
would similarly expect a decrease of about 0.75
cm/s2 in aP over the 11.5 year Pioneer 10 data interval
if this mechanism were the origin of aP .

Problem 3.3: Another suggestion related to the
RTGs is the following: during the early parts of the mis-
sions, there might have been a diﬀerential change of the
radiant emissivity of the solar-pointing sides of the RTGs
with respect to the deep-space facing sides. Note that, es-
pecially closer in the Sun, the inner sides were subjected
to the solar wind. Contrariwise, the outer sides were
sweeping through the solar-system dust cloud. There-
fore, it can be argued that these two processes could have
caused the eﬀect.

Estimate the possible diﬀerence in the fore-and-aft

emissivities of the RTGs needed to support this mech-
anism. Can this mechanism explain the seen anomaly on
Pioneers? Discuss the signiﬁcance of radioactive decay
for this mechanism.

Solution 3.3: Depending on how symmetrically
fore-and-aft they radiated, the relative fore-and-aft emis-

sivity of the alloy would have had to have changed by
10% to account for aP . Given our knowledge of the
∼
solar wind and the interplanetary dust, this amount of
a radiant change would be diﬃcult to explain, even if it
were of the right sign.

To obtain a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty,
consider if one side (fore or aft) of the RTGs had its
emissivity changed by only 1% with respect to the other
side.
In a simple cylindrical model of the RTGs, with
2000 W power (here only radial emission is assumed with
no loss out the sides), the ratio of power emitted by the
two sides would be 0.99 = 995/1005, or a diﬀerential
emission between the half cylinders of 10 W. Therefore,
the fore/aft asymmetry towards the normal would be
[10 W]
6.37 W.
a more sophisticated model starts oﬀ from ground zero
and asks if one gets about the same number 6.5 W. Say
there is a 1% diﬀerence fore to aft. For convenience just
say everything comes out of one RTG. Each RTG has 6
ﬁns or 12 faces. Take the forward faces as emitting 1%
more than the rear. That would mean each face emits
2.04 more Watts than a rear one. The two ﬁns that face
forward each emit 2.04 more Watts forward. Here one ig-
nores the back scatter that hits the two undersides of the
angled ﬁns whose faces are at 30 degrees to the forward
direction. Similarly one ignores the backscatter from the
underside of the angled ﬁns onto the ﬂat facing ﬁns. They
are at equal temperatures. So, the back scatter would
send more heat out to the sides which would make the
systematic eﬀect smaller. Take sin 30◦ of the front side
of the top ﬁns, which is 1/2, implying each emits 1.02
Watts forward. Ergo, the total is 6.12 W. This conﬁrms
the number is approximately correct. (The goal here was
only to ﬁnd an upper limit to this mechanism, an ex-
act estimation would require obtaining a very detailed
thermal model for the spacecraft.)

Taking this last number as the uncertainty from dif-
ferential emissivity of the RTGs. one obtains an acceler-
ation uncertainty of

σd.e. = 0.85

10−8 cm/s2.

(17)

×
Note that 10 σd.e. almost equals our ﬁnal aP . This is the
origin of our previous statement that
10% diﬀerential
emissivity (in the correct direction) would be needed to
explain aP .

∼

Finally, consider the signiﬁcance of radioactive decay
for this mechanism. The formal statistical error before
systematics of the determination was small [1]. (See the
next section.) An example is a speciﬁc one-day batch-
sequential value for aP , averaged over the entire 11.5 year

±
a batch-sequential error tends to be large. From radioac-
tive decay, the value of aP should have decreased by 0.75
of these units over 11.5 years. This is 5 times the above
variance, which is very large with batch sequential. Even
more stringently, this bound is good for all radioactive
heat sources. So, what if one were to argue that emissiv-
ity changes occurring before 1987 were the cause of the

0.16)

Pioneer eﬀect? There still should have been a decrease
in aP with time since then, which has not been observed.
Problem 3.4: Another possible on-board systematic
is from the expulsion of the He being created in the RTGs
from the α-decay of 238Pu.

The SNAP-19 Pioneer RTGs were designed in a such a
way that the He pressure is not totally contained within
the Pioneer heat source over the life of the RTGs. In-
stead, the Pioneer heat source contains a pressure relief
device which allows the generated He to vent out of the
heat source and into the thermoelectric converter. The
thermoelectric converter housing-to-power output recep-
tacle interface is sealed with a viton O-ring. The O-ring
allows the helium gas within the converter to be released
by permeation to the space environment throughout the
mission life of the Pioneer RTGs.

Information on the fuel pucks shows that they each
have heights of 0.212 inches with diameters of 2.145
inches. With 18 in each RTG and four RTGs per mission,
this gives a total volume of fuel of about 904 cm3. The
fuel is PMC Pu conglomerate. The amount of 238Pu in
this fuel is about 5.8 kg. With a half life of 87.74 years,
that means the rate of He production (from Pu decay) is
about 0.77 gm/year, assuming it all leaves the cermet. To
make this mechanism work, one would need that the He
leakage from the RTGs be preferentially directed away
from the Sun, with a velocity large enough to cause the
acceleration.

Can this mechanism explain the Pioneer anomaly?
What is the largest eﬀect possible with this mechanism?
What is the uncertainty?

Solution 3.4: Taking operational temperature on
the RTG surface of 320 F = 433 K, implies a 3kT /2
helium velocity of 1.22 km/s. Using this in the rocket
equation,

a(t) =

with our nominal Pioneer mass with half the fuel gone
and the assumption that the gas is all unidirected, yields a
10−8
maximal bound on the possible acceleration of 1.16
cm/s2. So, one can rule out helium permeating through
the O-rings as the cause of aP although it is a systematic
to be dealt with.

×

×

If one assumes a single elastic reﬂection, one can esti-
mate the fraction of the bias away from the Sun. This
estimate is (3/4) sin[30◦] times the average of the heat
momentum component parallel to the shortest distance
to the RTG ﬁn. Using this, one ﬁnds the bias would
10−8 cm/s2. This bias eﬀectively increases
be 0.31
the value of the solution for aP , which is too opti-
mistic given all the complications of the real system.
Therefore one can take the systematic expulsion to be
10−8 cm/s2.
aHe = (0.15

Problem 3.5: The eﬀect of propulsive mass expul-
sion due to gas leakage has to be assessed. Although this
eﬀect is largely unpredictable, many spacecraft have ex-
perienced gas leaks producing accelerations on the order

0.16)

±

×

of 10−7 cm/s2. Gas leaks generally behave diﬀerently
after each maneuver. The leakage often decreases with
time and becomes negligibly small.

Gas leaks can originate from Pioneer’s propulsion sys-
tem, which is used for mid-course trajectory maneu-
vers, for spinning-up or -down the spacecraft, and for
orientation of the spinning spacecraft. The Pioneers
are equipped with three pairs of hydrazine thrusters
which are mounted on the circumference of the Earth-
pointing high gain antenna. Each pair of thrusters forms
a Thruster Cluster Assembly (TCA) with two nozzles
aligned in opposition to each other. For attitude control,
two pairs of thrusters can be ﬁred forward or aft and are
used to precess the spinning antenna. The other pair of
thrusters is aligned parallel to the rim of the antenna with
nozzles oriented in co- and contra-rotation directions for
spin/despin maneuvers.

During both observing intervals for the two Pioneers,
there were no trajectory or spin/despin maneuvers. So,
in this analysis one is mainly concerned with preces-
sion (i.e., orientation or attitude control) maneuvers only.
Since the valve seals in the thrusters can never be per-
fect, one can ask if the leakages through the hydrazine
thrusters could be the cause of the anomalous accelera-
tion, aP .

Now consider the possible action of gas leaks originat-
ing from the spin/despin TCA. Each nozzle from this pair
of thrusters is subject to a certain amount of gas leak-
age. But only a diﬀerential leakage from the two nozzles
would produce an observable eﬀect causing the spacecraft
to either spin-down or spin-up.

588.3 kg m2, the antenna radius,

So, to obtain a gas leak uncertainty (and we empha-
size “uncertainty” vs. “error” because there is no other
evidence) one has to ask how large a diﬀerential force
is needed to cause the spin-down or spin-up eﬀects ob-
served? This depends on the moment of inertia about the
spin axis,
= 1.37
m, and the observed spin-down rates over three time in-
tervals. In Ref. [1] a ﬁnal systematic was determined at
the end by considering the three gas systematic results
to be a manifestation of errors that are uncorrelated and
are normally distributed around zero mean. For simplic-
ity, here we include the eﬀect of this analysis in terms
of an overall “eﬀective spin-down rate” of ¨θi =

It is possible that a similar mechanism of undetected

other words, what if there were some undetected gas leak-
age from the thrusters oriented along the spin axis of the
spacecraft that is causing aP ? How large would this have
to be? A force of (m = 241 kg)

Given the small amount of information, let us conser-

The argument for this is that, in the root sum of squares

the two pairs of thrusters with their nozzles oriented
along the line of sight direction. This directly trans-
lates into the acceleration errors introduced by the leak-
age during the interval of Pioneer 10 data,

At this point, one must conclude that the gas leak
mechanism for explaining the anomalous acceleration
seems very unlikely, because it is hard to understand why
it would aﬀect Pioneer 10 and 11 at the same level. One
also expects a gas leak would obey the rules of a Poisson
distribution. That clearly is not true.
Instead, analy-
ses of diﬀerent data sets indicate that aP behaves as a
constant bias rather than as a random variable [1].

10−8 cm/s2 (Pioneer 10) and 8.55

Problem 3.6: There are two “experimental” re-
sults for the Pioneer anomaly from the two spacecraft:
10−8 cm/s2
7.84
(Pioneer 11). The ﬁrst number, 7.84, is for Pioneer 10,
this number represents the entire 11.5 year data arc of
Pioneer 10. Similarly, Pioneer 11’s number, 8.55, repre-
sents a 3.75 year data arc.

×

×

The diﬀerence between the two craft could be due to
diﬀerent gas leakage. But it also could be due to heat
emitted from the RTGs. In particular, the two sets of
RTGs have had diﬀerent histories and so might have dif-
ferent emissivities. Pioneer 11 spent more time in the
inner solar system (absorbing radiation). Pioneer 10 has
swept out more dust in deep space. Further, Pioneer 11
experienced about twice as much Jupiter/Saturn radia-
tion as Pioneer 10. However, if the Pioneer eﬀect is real,
and not a systematic, these numbers should be approxi-
mately equal.

Estimate the value for the Pioneer Anomaly based on
these two independent determinations. What is the un-
certainty in this estimation?

Solution 3.6: One can calculate the time-weighted
average of the experimental results from the two craft:
[(11.5)(7.84) + (3.75)(8.55)]/(15.25) = 8.01 in units of

IV. COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMATICS

Given the very large number of observations for the
same spacecraft, the error contribution from observa-
tional noise is very small and not a meaningful measure of
uncertainty. It is therefore necessary to consider several
other eﬀects in order to assign realistic errors. Our ﬁrst
consideration is the statistical and numerical stability of
the calculations. We then go on to the cumulative inﬂu-
ence of all modeling errors and editing decisions. Finally
we discuss the reasons for and signiﬁcance of the annual
term.

Besides the factors mentioned above, we will discuss in
this section errors that may be attributed to the speciﬁc
hardware used to run the orbit determination computer
codes, together with computational algorithms and sta-
tistical methods used to derive the solution.

Problem 4.1:

In addition to the constant anoma-
lous acceleration term, an annual sinusoid was reported
[1]. The peaks of the sinusoid are centered on conjunc-
tion, where the Doppler noise is at a maximum. The
amplitude of this oscillatory term by the end of the data
10−8 cm/s2. The integral of a
interval was about 0.22

Solution 4.1: First observe that the standard errors
for radial velocity, vr, and acceleration, ar, are essentially
what one would expect for a linear regression. The caveat
is that they are scaled by the root sum of squares (RSS)
of the Doppler error and unmodeled sinusoidal errors,
rather than just the Doppler error. Further, because the
error is systematic, it is unrealistic to assume that the
errors for vr and ar can be reduced by a factor 1/√N ,
where N is the number of data points. Instead, averaging
their correlation matrix over the data interval, T , results
in the estimated systematic error of

V. ERROR BUDGET AND FINAL RESULT

The tests documented in the preceding sections have
considered various potential sources of systematic error.
The results of these tests are included in Table IV. The
only major source of uncertainty not discussed in this
problem set is item 2d), “Non-isotropic radiative cooling
of the spacecraft.” The reader can consult Refs.
[1, 2]
for more details. Other, more minor eﬀects were also
[1]. This Table serves as a system-
discussed in Ref.
atic “error budget,” which is useful both for evaluating
the accuracy of the solution for aP and also for guiding
possible future eﬀorts with other spacecraft.

Finally, there is the intractable mathematical problem
of how to handle combined experimental and systematic
errors. In the end it was decided to treat them all in a
least squares uncorrelated manner [1].

Problem 5.1: The results of our analyses are sum-
marized in Table IV. There are two columns of results.
The ﬁrst gives a bias, bP , and the second gives an un-
certainty,
σP . The constituents of the error budget are
listed separately in three diﬀerent categories: 1) system-
atics generated external to the spacecraft; 2) on-board
generated systematics, and 3) computational systemat-
ics. Our ﬁnal result then will become some average

is the formal solution for the Pioneer anomaly.

Discuss contributions of various eﬀects to the total er-
ror budget and determine the ﬁnal value for the Pioneer
anomaly, aP .

Solution 5.1: The least signiﬁcant factors of our er-
ror budget are in the ﬁrst group of eﬀects, those external
to the spacecraft. From the table one sees that some are
near the limit of contributing. But in totality, they are
insigniﬁcant.

As was expected, the on-board generated systematics
are the largest contributors to our total error budget.
All the important constituents are listed in the second
group of eﬀects in Table IV. Among these eﬀects, the
radio beam reaction force produces the largest bias to
10−8 cm/s2. It makes the Pioneer ef-
our result, 1.10
fect larger. The largest bias/uncertainty is from RTG
heat reﬂecting oﬀ the spacecraft. The eﬀect as large as
10−8 cm/s2. Large uncertainties also

VI. DISCUSSION

The actual trajectories of the Pioneers are calculated
using very complicated orbital determination codes with
double-precision accuracies. Even so, many the implica-
tions of the measured anomaly can be determined with
simple physical ideas.

The aim of this work was to give a set of problems
on a topic of current interest, the Pioneer anomaly, that
would involve and excite students. We wanted to em-
phasize the strength of the simple physics approach in
addressing complex problems. We hope that this collec-
tion of problems will be helpful not only to those who are
interested in learning more about the Pioneer anomaly,
but also will be useful to the wider audience of people
interested in general physics.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

If we have succeeded in our above stated aim, the ﬁrst
grateful acknowledgment must go to Catherine Mignard
of the Observatoire de Nice. She not only inquired if
such a set as this could be written for the students at
the University of Nice, she also made valuable comments
as the work progressed. We must, of course, also once
again express our gratitude to our many colleagues who,
over the years, have either collaborated with us on this
problem or given of their wisdom.

The work of SGT and JDA was carried out at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technol-
ogy under a contract with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration. MMN acknowledges support by

APPENDIX A: ORBITAL PARAMETERS FOR
PIONEERS 10 AND 11

In Table V we give the hyperbolic orbital parameters
for Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 at epoch 1 January 1987,
01:00:00 UTC. The semi-major axis is a, e is the eccen-
tricity, I is the inclination, Ω is the longitude of the as-
cending node, ω is the argument of the perihelion, M0
is the mean anomaly, f0 is the true anomaly at epoch,
and r0 is the heliocentric radius at the epoch. The direc-
tion cosines of the spacecraft position for the axes used
are (α, β, γ). These direction cosines and angles are re-
ferred to the mean equator and equinox of J2000. The
ecliptic longitude ℓ0 and latitude b0 are also listed for an
obliquity of 23◦26
4119. The numbers in parentheses
denote realistic standard errors in the last digits.

APPENDIX B: ALLAN DEVIATION

In order to achieve the highest accuracy, the Doppler
frequency shift of the carrier wave is referenced to
ground-based atomic frequency standards. The observ-
able is the fractional frequency shift of the stable and
coherent two-way radio signal (Earth-spacecraft-Earth)

where νr and νt are, respectively, the transmitted and
received frequencies, t is the receiving time, and 2L is
the overall optical distance (including diﬀraction eﬀects)
traversed by the photon in both directions.

The received signal is compared with the expected
measurement noise in y. This is characterized by its Al-
lan deviation. deﬁned as

For advanced planetary missions such as Cassini,
equipped with multi-frequency links in the X- and Ka-
10−14
bands, Allan deviations reach the level of σy ≃
for averaging times between 103 and 104 s. The Pioneer
spacecraft were equipped with S-band Doppler commu-
nication systems for which Allan deviations were usually

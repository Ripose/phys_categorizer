The solution of the classic problem of stress in a rotating elastic disk or cylinder, as solved in
standard texts on elasticity theory, has two features: dynamical equations are used that are valid
only in an inertial frame of reference, and quadratic terms are dropped in displacement gradient
in the deﬁnition of the strain. I show that, in an inertial frame of reference where the dynamical
equations are valid, it is incorrect to drop the quadratic terms because they are as large as the
linear terms that are kept. I provide an alternate formulation of the problem by transforming the
dynamical equations to a corotating frame of reference of the disk/cylinder, where dropping the
quadratic terms in displacement gradient is justiﬁed. The analysis shows that the classic textbook
derivation of stress and strain must be interpreted as being carried out in the corotating frame of
the medium.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of stresses in rotating disks and cylinders is important in practical applications to rotating machinery,
such as turbines and generators, and wherever large rotational speeds are used. The textbook problem of stresses
in elastic rotating disks and cylinders, using the assumption of plane strain or plane stress, is published in classic
texts, such as Love [1], Landau and Lifshitz [2], Nadai [3], Sechler [4], Timoshenko and Goodier [5], and Volterra and
Gaines [6]. The standard approach presented in these texts has two characteristic features:

1. Newton’s second law of motion is applied in an inertial frame of reference to derive dynamical equations for the

continuum (see Eq. (1) below), and

2. quadratic terms in displacement gradient are dropped in the deﬁnition of the strain tensor (see Eq.(20) below).

In this paper, I show that, for a rotating elastic body, the second feature of the solution is inconsistent with the ﬁrst:
dropping the quadratic terms in the displacement gradient is an unjustiﬁed approximation in an inertial frame of
reference. In what follows, I refer to the method that is employed in Ref. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] as ‘the standard method’,
and for brevity, I will refer to a cylinder as a generalization of both a disk and a cylinder.

The classic problem of stress in an elastic rotating cylinder is complex because the undeformed reference state
of the body is the non-rotating state. The deformed state is one of steady-state rotation. The analysis of the
problem must connect the non-rotating reference state to the rotating stressed/strained state. These two states are
typically connected by large angles of rotation. When large angles of rotation are present, the quadratic terms in the
displacement gradient cannot be dropped (in an inertial frame of reference) in the deﬁnition of the strain [7, 8, 9]. The
problem of stress analysis when large-angle rotations are present is well known and has been discussed by a number
of authors in general contexts, see for example [7, 8, 9]. However, large-angle rotations in the problem of a rotating
elastic cylinder have not been dealt with in a technically correct manner, because quadratic strain gradient terms are
incorrectly dropped in the ‘standard method’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

In this work, I formulate the elastic problem of a rotating cylinder in a frame of reference that is corotating with
the material. In this corotating frame, the quadratic terms in the displacement gradient can be dropped, and the
resulting diﬀerential equations are linear and can be solved.

In section II, I review the ‘standard method’ of solution used in Ref. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and show that for a rotating
cylinder the displacement gradient in an inertial frame of reference is of order unity, and therefore quadratic terms
(in strain tensor deﬁnition) cannot be dropped when compared to the linear terms. Section III contains the bulk
of the analysis. I describe the corotating systems of coordinates and the transformation of the velocity ﬁeld to the
corotating frame. I use the velocity transformation rules to transform the dynamical Eq. (1) from the inertial frame
to the corotating frame (see Eq. (61) or (62)), where extra terms arise known as the centrifugal acceleration and the
coriolis acceleration. In section IV, I write the explicit component equations for stress (in cylindrical coordinates)
for the rotating elastic cylinder in its corotating frame. To display the resulting solution concretely, I derive the
well-known formula for the stress in the rotating cylinder for the case of plane stress, as computed in the corotating
frame. Stress is an objective tensor, i.e., stress is independent of observer motion [10, 11], so the physical meaning
of stress in the corotating frame is the same as in the inertial frame. Therefore, the stress ﬁeld components in the
corotating frame are equal to the stress ﬁeld components in the inertial frame, see Eq. (36).

II. STANDARD SOLUTION METHOD

In the ‘standard method’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the stress analysis of elastic rotating cylinders starts with the dynamical

equations, which, in generalized curvilinear coordinates are given by [2, 10, 11]

where σkj are the contravariant components of the stress tensor, f k is the vector body force, and ak is the acceleration
vector. In Eq. (1), repeated indices are summed and the semicolon indicates covariant diﬀerentiation with respect to
the coordinates. Expressed in terms of the velocity ﬁeld in spatial coordinates, the acceleration is given by [10, 11]

σkj

;j + ρf k = ρ ak

ak =

+ vjvk
;j

∂vk
∂t

where va is the velocity ﬁeld, and the semicolon indicates covariant diﬀerentiation with respect to the coordinates,
;j is called the convective term. In Eq. (1), the stress σkj , acceleration ak, and body force f k, are generally
and vjvk
time dependent. Equation (1) is derived by applying Newton’s second law of motion to an element of the medium.
Newton’s second law is valid only in an inertial frame of reference, and consequently the validity of Eq. (1) is limited
to inertial frames of reference.

In the ‘standard method’ of solution, Eq. (1) is applied by invoking an “eﬀective body force”, of magnitude equal to
the centrifugal force in the rotating frame. In the inertial frame, there is actually no eﬀective force (such as Coriolis
or cetrifugal force). For the case of a body rotating about its principle axis, a more careful determination of the terms
f k − ak in Eq. (1) comes from setting the body force to zero (or setting equal to some applied force) and computing
the material acceleration ak for a given body motion. For a rigid body, or a uniform density elastic cylinder that is
rotating about its axis of symmetry at a constant angular velocity ωo, the Cartesian velocity ﬁeld components are:
v1 = −ωo y, v2 = ωo x, and v3 = 0, where superscripts 1,2,3 indicate components on the Cartesian basis vectors
associated with the x,y,z-axes (in the inertial frame). Corresponding to this velocity ﬁeld, the cylindrical components
of the acceleration ﬁeld are given by

where I have chosen the z-axis as the symmetry axis and the bar over the components indicates that they are in the
inertial frame of reference in cylindrical coordinates. For the case where there are no body forces, with the acceleration
in Eq. (3), Eq. (1) in cylindrical coordinates leads to the three equations

where the superscripts 1,2,3 enumerate tensor components on the r, φ, z coordinate basis vectors respectively, in
cylindrical coordinates and the commas indicate partial diﬀerentiation with respect to these coordinates.

For steady rotation at a uniform angular velocity ωo, and assuming the absence of elastic waves, there is rotational
symmetry about the z-axis so the stress components do not depend on azimuthal angle φ. Therefore, all derivatives
with respect to φ are zero, leading to the equations:

I introduce physical components of stress, σrr, σφφ,σzz, σrφ, σrz, and σφz, with units of force per unit area and

which are related to the tensor components ¯σ11, ¯σ22, ¯σ33, ¯σ12, ¯σ13, and ¯σ23, by [10, 11]

Expressing Eq. (7)–(9) in terms of the physical components, I obtain the well-known equations valid in an inertial
frame of reference [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],

Note that Eqs. (16)–(18) have been derived using Newtons’s second law, and so they are valid only in an inertial
frame of reference. In particular, Eqs. (16)–(18) are not valid in a rotating frame of reference.

In
When a rotating disk or cylinder is analyzed, the assumption of plane stress or plane strain is often made.
both cases, stresses must be related to strains by constitutive equations. For the simplest case of a homogeneous,
isotropic, perfectly elastic body, the constitutive equations in curvilinear coordinates in an inertial frame can be
written as [2, 10, 11]

where λ and µ are the Lam´e material constants, eik are the contravariant strain tensor components, e = e a
a
contraction of the strain tensor, and gik are the contravariant metric tensor components.

The Eulerian strain tensor eik is related to the displacement ﬁeld ui by [10, 11]

σik = λ e gik + 2 µ eik

(cid:1)

;k are dropped, which leads to linear

However, dropping the quadratic terms in Eq. (20) is not justiﬁed for a rotating body because these (dimensionless)
terms um;i are of order unity. To prove this assertion, it is suﬃcient to consider the limiting case of a rigid body
in steady-state rotation at constant angular speed ωo. The deformation mapping function gives the coordinates zk
(here taken to be Cartesian) of a particle at time t in terms of the particle’s coordinates Z k in some reference state
(conﬁguration) at time t = to:

so that zk(Z m, to) = Z k. The deformation mapping function has an inverse, which I quote here for later reference

Both zk and Z m refer to the same Cartesian coordinate system. The coordinates of a particle initially at Z k at
t = to = 0 rotating about the z-axis are given by the deformation mapping function

zk = zk(Z m, t)

Z m = Z m(zk, t)

zk = Rk

where δm
l = +1 if m = l and 0 if m 6= l. Therefore, from Eq. (25), it is clear that gradients of displacement um;k
appearing in Eq (20) are of order unity and therefore the quadratic terms um;ium
;k cannot be dropped because they are
not small. More speciﬁcally, the dropped terms in Eq. (20) vary in time between -2 and 0 (in Cartesian components):

The above calculation was done for a rigid body, but clearly, a similar error is introduced for elastic bodies. Therefore,
in general, for a rotating elastic body, the quadratic terms in displacement gradients in Eq. (20) cannot be dropped [14].
In cylindrical components, the relation between the physical components (see Ref. [10, 11]) of strain, ¯err and ¯eφφ,

(I use a bar over ¯err and ¯eφφ to indicate that these are cylindrical components, and indices rr and φφ (as distict from
11 and 22) to indicate that these are physical components and not tensor components. See the Appendix and Table
I and II for notation conventions.) In Eq. (28) and (29), I have assumed that there is no dependence on φ and z, so I
have set derivatives with respect to these variables to zero.

In the ‘standard method’ of solving for the stress in a rotating cylinder [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the quadratic terms in

Eq. (28) and (29) are incorrectly dropped.

The straight forward approach to correctly studying the stresses in a rotating disk or cylinder, involves keeping the
quadratic terms in displacement gradient in Eq. (20). However, this approach does not appear promising because it
leads to insoluble nonlinear diﬀerential equations. In the next section, I approach the problem by using a transforma-
tion to a corotating frame of reference, in which dropping the quadratic terms can be justiﬁed for moderate angular
velocity of rotation ωo.

III. TRANSFORMATION TO THE ROTATING FRAME

As discussed in the introduction, the problem of an elastic rotating cylinder is complicated because the un-
stressed/unstrained reference state is the non-rotating state, while the stressed (strained) state is rotating, and these
two states are typically related by a large (time-dependent) angle. The analysis of the rotating disk or cylinder must
relate the stresses in the rotating state to the reference conﬁguration, which I take to be the non-rotating state. I
deﬁne a transformation from an inertial frame of reference to the corotating frame of reference of the cylinder. This
transformation provides a relation between the rotating stressed state and the non-rotating reference conﬁguration.

A. Coordinate Systems

Starting from an inertial frame of reference, S, deﬁned by the Cartesian coordinates zk = (x, y, z), I make a
transformation to a rotating frame of reference S′. The rotating frame will be corotating with the cylinder so that
in this frame S′ the azimuthal velocity ﬁeld will be zero at all times. The transformation from an inertial system of
coordinates to a rotating system of coordinates is most simply done using Cartesian coordinates. On the other hand,
the assumed cylindrical symmetry of the problem begs for use of cylindrical coordinates. Hence I will make use of four
systems of coordinates. In the inertial frame S, I have two systems of coordinates: a Cartesian system of coordinates
zk = zk = (x, y, z), and a cylindrical system of coordinates xi = (r, φ, z).
In the corotating frame of reference,
S′, I have a Cartesian system of coordinates z′k = (x′, y′, z′) and a cylindrical coordinate system x′i = (r′, φ′, z′).
These coordinates are summarized in Table I and the Appendix. I also introduce notation for tensor components
in each of the four coordinate systems, see Table II . The Cartesian components of the stress tensor in the inertial
frame S will be denoted by σik. In the same inertial frame S, the cylindrical components of stress will be ¯σik. The

Cartesian components of stress in the corotating frame S′ will have a prime, σ′ik. In this same corotating frame, S′,
the cylindrical components of stress will be denoted by using a tilde, ˜σik.

From the vantage point of an inertial frame of reference, S, with Cartesian coordinates zk, consider a cylinder
whose symmetry axis is aligned and colocated with the coordinate z-axis. At time t = −∞, take the cylinder to
be non-rotating. Now assume that in the distant past, around the time t ∼ −T , the cylinder begins a slow angular
acceleration lasting a long time, on the order of 1/ǫ, where 1/ǫ << T . An example of such an angular acceleration
function is

ω(t) =

ωo [1 + tanh(ǫ(t + T ))]

1
2

where I assume that τ << 1/ǫ << T and τ is the longest time constant in the problem. This inequality states that
the acceleration occurs slowly, τ << 1/ǫ, slower than any time scale in the problem, and that this acceleration occurs
in the distant past, 1/ǫ << T , so that at t = 0, I have a steady-state situation of a cylinder rotating at constant
angular speed ωo. By slowly accelerating the cylinder, I avoid introducing modes of vibration. As the cylinder’s
angular velocity increases from t = −∞, each particle comprising the cylinder moves along a spiral trajectory (with
increasing radius). From the point of view of the inertial frame S, the stresses on a given element of the medium
(particle) are such that they cause the particle to experience an acceleration, moving along the spiral path. At t = 0,
the cylinder has achieved its maximum angular velocity ωo. Due to the assumption of a perfectly elastic medium, at
t = 0 the velocity ﬁeld has zero radial component; all particles of the cylinder are moving azimuthally (in a plane
perpendicular to the z-axis with zero radial component). The velocity ﬁeld is that of a rigid body and the acceleration
ﬁeld is given by Eq. (3).

Now I introduce the corotating frame of reference, S′, with the Cartesian coordinates z′

rotation is equal to that of the cylinder at all times. The coordinates zk (≡ zk) and z′

k, whose angular velocity of

k (≡ z′ k) are related by

where the time dependent matrix Aik(t) is given by

′
i = Aik(t) zk

z

cos(θ − θo)
sin(θ − θo) 0
− sin(θ − θo) cos(θ − θo) 0



Aik(t) =





ωo
2ǫ

where θ is a function of time given by the integral of ω(t):

θ(t) =

[ǫ(t + T ) + log cosh(ǫt + ǫT ) + log 2]

and θ(0) = θo.

By construction, in the corotating frame S′ the particles comprising the material are not rotating about the z′-axis;
there is zero azimuthal component of the velocity ﬁeld at all times. As the angular velocity ω(t) increases from
t = −∞, each particle comprising the cylinder experiences an increasing eﬀective centrifugal force that displaces the
particle to a larger radius. In this rotating frame S′, there will (in general) also be a Coriolis force. However, in S′,
for moderate angular speed ωo, the strain eik will be small, and the gradients of the displacement ﬁeld will also be
small. Consequently, dropping the quadratic terms um;ium

;k in Eq. (20) will provide a good approximation to eik.

Note that the transformation that relates cylindrical components in inertial frame S and rotating frame S′ is given

by the identity matrix

∂za
∂z′ m
Furthermore, the time dependent transformation between inertial cylindrical coordinates xi = (r, φ, z) in S and
corotating cylindrical coordinates x′ i = (r′, φ′, z′) in S′, is given by

Of course the transformation in Eq. (36) must be used so that the components are referring to the same physical
point in space having coordinates xn = (r, φ, z) and x′ n = (r′, φ′, z′), where the time-dependent relation between xn
and x′ n is given by Eq. (35).

The Eulerian strain tensor eij transforms in a more complicated manner. A general deformation is given by

where a particle at time t = to in the reference conﬁguration has (curvilinear) coordinates X k, and in the deformed
state at time t the particle has coordinates xi (in the same curvilinear coordinate system). The Eulerian strain tensor
eij(X, x) depends on two points: X in the reference conﬁguration and x in the deformed state. Consequently, under a
general coordinate transformation to a moving frame, xi → x′ i = hi(xk, t), the Eulerian strain is a two-point tensor,
which transforms as a second rank tensor under transformation of deformed coordinates

xi = xi(X k, t)

xi → x

′ i = hi(xk, t)

X i → X

′ i = hi(X k, to)

and transforms as a scalar under transformation of reference state coordinates

so that [15, 16, 17]

)

where x and x′, and X and X ′, are related by Eq. (38) and (39), and I used Eq. (34). Therefore, the cylindrical
components of strain in the inertial frame S, ¯emn(X, x), are equal to the cylindrical components of strain in the
rotating frame S′, ˜eik(X ′, x′). Finally, since I assume rotational symmetry about the z-axis (and z′-axis) so that all
physical quantities have no dependence on φ or Φ, which are the azimuthal coordinates of the point in the deformed
state, x = xi = (r, φ, z), and coordinates of the point in the reference conﬁguration, X = X i = (R, Φ, Z). Because of
the nature of the transformation to the rotating frame in Eq. (35), Eq. (40) can be used with r′ = r, R′ = R, z′ = z,
and Z ′ = Z. Therefore, the tensor components in the corotating frame are identical to the components in the inertial
frame.

B. Transformation of Lagrangean and Eulerian Velocities

The motion of a particle in the cylinder is given by the deformation mapping function. In the inertial frame S, using
Cartesian coordinates, the motion of the particle is given by Eq. (21), where the particle in the reference conﬁguration
at time t = to has coordinates Z m. The coordinates Z m label the particle in the Lagrangean desription. Using the
transformation to the rotating frame in Eq. (31), the motion of the particle with label Z m with respect to the rotating
S′ frame Cartesian coordinates is given by

In discussing the transformation to the rotating system of coordinates, I must distinguish between the velocity of a
given particle in the medium (the Lagrangean picture) and the velocity ﬁeld (the Eulerian picture). The Lagrangean
velocity vi(S; Z m; t) of a given particle (whose coordinates in the reference conﬁguration are Z m) with respect to the
inertial frame S is deﬁned as the partial time derivative of that particle’s zi-coordinates, when holding Z m constant

′ k(Z m, t) = Akj (t) zj(Z m, t)

z

vi(S; Z m; t) =

∂zi(Z m, t)
∂t

The Eulerian velocity ﬁeld, vi(zk, t), with respect to the frame S is a function of coordinates zk and time t and is
related to the Lagrangean (particle) velocity by

vi(S; Z m; t) = vi(S; Z m(zk; t), t) = vi(zk, t)

where I used Eq. (22) to express the particle coordinate Z m in terms of its position zk at time t.

I can describe the same particle’s velocity (whose coordinates in the (inertial frame) reference conﬁguration are
Z m) with respect to the rotating frame of reference S′. The velocity of this particle with respect to the rotating frame
S′ is

where I used Eq. (31) to express the particle’s coordinates in terms of coordinates in the S frame and the dot on ˙Aik
indicates diﬀerentiation with respect to time.

The components vi(S; Z m; t) and v′

i(S′; Z m; t) represent physically distinct vectors (geometric objects). Each of
these vectors can be expressed on the other basis. In particular, according to the standard transformation rules for
vector components, I have

; Z m; t) = Aim vm(S
v
i(S
′
m(S; Z m; t) = Ami vi(S; Z m; t)
v

; Z m; t)

′

Equations (45) and (46) are the standard tensor transformation rules for vector components under the coordinate
transformation given in Eq. (31). In summary, I must distinguish between four (Cartesian component) velocities [18]:

vi(S; Z m; t) = ˙zi(Z m, t) = components on z-axes of particle velocity with respect to S

vi(S′; Z m; t) = components on z-axes of particle velocity with respect to S′

i(S′; Z m; t) = ˙z′
v′

i(Z m, t) = components on z′-axes of particle velocity with respect to S′

m(S; Z m; t) = components on z′-axes of particle velocity with respect to S
v′

These four velocities are related. Multiplying Eq. (44) by Aim(t), summing over index i and using the orthogonal

matrix properties

leads to [18]

Ain(t) Aim(t) = δnm
Ani(t) Ami(t) = δnm

ωnk(S

The tensor ωnk(S′, S) describes the time-dependent rotation of frame S′ with respect to frame S. Similarly, using
Eq. (21), substituting the inverse relation

carrying out the time diﬀerentiation, multiplying by Ami, summing over i and use of the orthogonality relations in
Eq. (48) leads to

on S frame coordinates zm. Furthermore, the velocity ﬁeld components on the left side of Eq. (57) are taken on

IV. ROTATING CYLINDER EQUATIONS IN COROTATING COORDINATES

In order to obtain the explicit equations for a rotating cylinder from Eq. (62), I need to compute ˜vn, ˜ω n

m , and ζn.
As described previously, I take the reference conﬁguration of the cylinder to be the stationary cylinder at t = −∞ in
the inertial frame S. I assume that the cylinder experiences a slow angular acceleration (such as given by Eq. (30))
that lasts approximately time ∆t = −1/ǫ, and has peak magnitude at t = −T , with 1/ǫ << T . Equation (62) is
general; it is valid for all motions and all materials. In what follows, I restrict my remarks to a perfectly elastic
cylinder.

In the inertial frame S, as the cylinder increases its angular velocity, the material particles of the cylinder move
outward in a spiral path, with some motion in the z-direction. In the inertial frame S, the contravariant components
of the velocity ﬁeld in cylindrical coordinates are

¯vi = (¯v1, ω(t), ¯v3)

where ¯v1 and ¯v3 are the radial and z-components of velocity and where the azimuthal component ω(t) is given
I obtain the velocity components in cylindrical coordinates in the corotating frame S′ as follows:
by Eq. (30).
ﬁrst, transform ¯vi to inertial frame Cartesian components vi using the standard vector transformation rule between
Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates. Next, use Eq. (57) to transform the inertial frame Cartesian componets vi
to the rotating S′ frame Cartesian velocity ﬁeld v′ i. Finally, use the standard tensor transformation rules, between
Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates (both in the rotating frame), to transform the velocity ﬁeld from Cartesian
components v′ i to cylindrical (rotating frame) components ˜v′ i, where I made use of the angular velocity components

In the corotating frame S′, there is particle motion around the time t ≈ −T . However, at t = 0 the particles have

reached their new (deformed) steady-state positions and motion has ceased; the velocity ﬁeld is given by

which is the velocity ﬁeld of a rigid body. Since the velocity ﬁeld is zero at t = 0, the Coriolis acceleration term in
Eq. (62) does not contribute in steady-state rotation.

Using Eq.(66), the angular velocity tensor in cylindrical coordinates in the corotating frame S′ is

At t = 0, the time derivative of the angular velocity tensor is zero. Using this fact, and Eq. (70) and (71), the stress
Eqs. (62) in the corotating frame are given by

Equations (72)–(74) are the equations satisﬁed by the stress tensor in cylindrical components at t = 0, in steady-state
rotation in the corotating frame S′. In terms of physical components (see Eq. (10)–(15)), Eq. (72)–(74) become:

Note that Eq. (75)–(77) in the corotating frame S′ have the same form as Eq. (16)–(18) in the inertial frame S.
However, the key point is that the corotating frame Eq. (75)–(77) have a distinct advantage: the quadratic strain
gradient terms in the deﬁnition of the strain in Eq. (20) can be dropped because they are small in the corotating
frame S′. The same is not true in the inertial frame S.

To proceed with the solution in the corotating frame, the constitutive Eq. (19) (in inertial frame S) must be
transformed to the corotating frame S′ by taking cylindrical components in the S frame and using Eq. (34) to obtain
an expression of the same form as in Eq. (19) but in the corotating frame S′.
In this transformation, the Lam´e
constants are treated as invariants. So the constitutive relations in the corotating frame S′ are the same as in the
inertial frame S.

In the corotating frame S′, dropping the quadratic terms in displacement gradients, which relate the displacement
ﬁeld to strain, is justiﬁed since in the rotating frame S′ these terms can be considered small for moderate angular
velocity. Therefore, the solution in the corotating frame S′ can proceed in an analogous way to that of the ‘standard
method’, but I have not made the (incorrect) approximation of dropping quadratic displacement gradient terms in
the inertial frame.

The stress tensor is objective, so the stress in the rotating frame has the same meaning as in the inertial frame, see
Eq. (36). The boundary conditions on the stress tensor components in the corotating frame are the same as in the
inertial frame, due to the objectivity of stress tensor. Alternatively, one can verify that the boundary conditions on
the stress in the rotating frame are the same as in the inertial frame [20].

V. PLANE STRESS SOLUTION

The solution of the problem of stress in a rotating cylinder in the corotating frame of reference now follows. The
solution in the corotating frame parallels the solution in the ‘standard method’ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], except that the
incorrect approximation of dropping the quadratic strain gradient terms in the inertial frame is avoided.

I assume that in the inertial frame S, the cylinder is rotating at angular velocity ωo and has radius b. Under the

assumption of plane stress [5], where

with boundary condition of zero stress on the long peripheral surface:

As mentioned above, stress is an objective tensor [10, 11], so the physical meaning of the boundary conditions in
Eq. (78) and (79) in the corotating frame S′ are the same as the physical meaning of the analogous conditions in the
inertial frame (as used, for example by Timoshenko [5]). Also, as shown above, I may take the (transformed) linear
elastic relations in the corotating frame to be of the same form as in the inertial frame:

where Young’s modulus E and Poisson’s ratio ν are related to the Lam`e constants by

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

˜σzz = ˜σφz = ˜σrz = 0

˜σrr|r′=b = 0

˜err =

˜σrr − ν ˜σφφ

(cid:1)

E

E

E =

ν =

µ (3λ + 2µ)
λ + µ
λ
2 (λ + µ)

where the Lam`e constants are treated as invariant scalars in the transformation. The elastic relations in Eq. (80) and
(81) are in the corotating frame S′. They can be obtained from the linear elastic relations in the inertial frame S,
Eq. (19), by using the transformations to the corotating frame in Eq. (36) and (40), and the coordinate transformation
in Eq. (35). In doing the transformation of the elastic relations to the corotating frame, I am assuming that the tensor
that enters in the inertial frame elastic relations in Eq. (19) is the Eulerian strain tensor given in Eq.(20) and the
quadratic terms have not been dropped. (As discussed earlier, dropping the quadratic terms in the displacement
gradients is done in the corotating frame.)

For small displacements in corotating frame S′, the gradients of the displacement vector in frame S′ can be assumed
small—for moderate angular velocity ωo, so the quadratic terms in the gradient of the displacement can be neglected.
Therefore, in the corotating frame S′, I take the relation between the radial component of the displacement vector,
˜u, and the physical components of strain, ˜err and ˜eφφ, to be (compare with Eq. (28) and (29))

where the tilde on ˜u indicates that the radial component of displacement ﬁeld is taken in the corotating frame S′ and
the prime on r′ indicates that the cylindrical radial coordinate is in the corotating frame S′, see the transformation
in Eq. (35).

Substituting Eq. (84) and (85) into Eq. (80) and (81), leads to relations between the physical components of stress

and the radial displacement ﬁeld

The physical stress components in Eq. (92) and (93) are in the corotating frame S′. However, due to the transformation
between the corotating frame and the inertial frame in Eq. (36), and the coordinate transformation in Eq. (35), the
corotating frame components in Eq. (92) and (93) are equal to the inertial frame components of stress. Using the
expressions in the rotating frame, such as Eq. (75)—(77), expressions for plane strain and other boundary conditions
can be derived for rotating cylinders, disks and annular rings, see Ref. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

(cid:3)

VI. SUMMARY

The classic problem of stress in rotating disks or cylinders is important in applications to turbines, generators, and
whenever large rotational speeds exist. The textbook problem of stress in perfectly elastic disks or cylinders is solved
in standard texts [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The ‘standard method’ of solution begins with Eq. (1) and drops terms that are
quadratic in strain gradient in the deﬁnition of the strain, see Eq. (20). Equation (1) is valid only in an inertial frame
of reference, since it is derived from Newton’s second law of motion, which itself is only valid in an inertial reference
frame.

In this work, I have shown that dropping the terms quadratic in the displacement gradient (in Eq. (20)) is incorrect
in the inertial frame in which Eq. (1) is applied in the ‘standard method’ of solution [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. I provide an
alternative formulation of the rotating elastic cylinder problem in a frame of reference that is corotating with the
cylinder. In this corotating frame, I derive the dynamical equation for the stress (see Eq. (61) or (62)) and I show that
terms quadratic in the displacement gradient can be dropped because they are small (for moderate angular speed of
rotation). This analysis in the corotating frame shows that the ‘standard method’ of solution [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] should
be interpreted as being carried out in the corotating frame of reference of the cylinder.

Furthermore, when stresses are computed in rotating disks or cylinders composed of materials that have more
complex constitutive equations, such as elastic-plastic or viscoelastic behavior, one must carefully justify dropping
the quadratic terms in displacement gradients. If dropping these terms cannot be justiﬁed, then the problem can be
analyzed in a rotating frame, using the derived Eq. (61) or (62). Another practical application of the stress Eq. (62)
in the rotating frame is to study elastic waves in bodies during rotation, where coriolis eﬀects may play a role.

and providing numerous discussions. The author thanks Howard Brandt for discussions and pointing out Ref. [2].

APPENDIX A: CONVENTIONS

I specify tensor components on coordinate (non-holonomic) basis vectors using numerical indices, 1,2,3, such as
¯σ12. For physical components, which have the dimensions associated with that quantity, I use lettered indices, such
as ¯σrφ. In addition, I must distinguish between four coordinate systems: Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates in the
inertial frame S and Cartesian and cylindrical in the corotating frame S′. I use zk = (x, y, z) and xk = (r, φ, z) for
Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates in inertial frame S, respectively. In corotating frame S′, I use z′ k = (x′, y′, z′)
and x′ k = (r′, φ′, z′) for Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates, respectively. For distinguishing components in these
four coordinate systems, I use an additional mark as follows: absence of mark and a bar, for Cartesian and cylindrical

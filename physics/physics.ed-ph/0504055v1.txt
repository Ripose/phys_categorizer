Abstract

We describe some instances of the appearance of Chern’s mathematical ideas in physics. By

means of simple examples, we bring out the geometric and topological ideas which have found

application in describing the physical world. These applications range from magnetic monopoles

in electrodynamics to instantons in quantum chromodynamics to the geometric phase of quantum

mechanics. The ﬁrst part of this article is elementary and addressed to a general reader. The

second part is somewhat more demanding and is addressed to advanced students of mathematics

and physics.

Take a loop of string and lay it out ﬂat on a table so it doesn’t cross itself. Keeping your

ﬁnger pointed along the string, move it all the way around the loop at unit speed. Note that

the direction of your ﬁnger describes a full circle. Writing θ for the angle between your ﬁnger

and the x axis, (x and y axes chosen conveniently along perpendicular edges of the table)

we ﬁnd that the “angular velocity” κ = dθ/dt of the tangent vector (the unit tangent vector
to the string is ˆt = (cos θ, sin θ)) integrates to 2π. We now have the remarkable relation:

1/2π

κdt = 1/2π

dθ = 1,

where L is the length of the string. What is so remarkable about this formula? If one

wiggles the string, the value of κ at points of the string will change. However, the integral

(1) is unchanged.

It is a topological invariant, unaﬀected by small deformations. The

angular velocity dθ/dt of the tangent vector is just the curvature of the string. Remember,

we traverse the string at unit speed so, if s is the arc length parameter, ds/dt = 1 and

κ = dθ/ds = dθ/dt. Physically, κ is the transverse force necessary to keep on track a

bug of unit mass traversing the loop at unit speed. From its deﬁnition κ = dθ/ds, we

see that κ is a geometrical quantity, described by a real number. However, its integral

1/2π
κds is an integer and a topological quantity, the number of times the tangent vector
ˆt winds around the circle of directions in the plane. The general ﬂavour of the simple

R

eq. (1) is that the integral of a certain geometric quantity over the loop is a topological

quantity. This is a simple example of a class of mathematical results discovered by the

mathematicians Chern, Weil and Pontryagin. These results are deep ones involving global

diﬀerential geometry and topology. They have had applications in physics, in such diverse

ﬁelds as elementary particle physics and the quantum hall eﬀect. The purpose of this article

(and the next) is to bring out the main impact of this body of mathematical work in the

physical sciences.

It is impractical within the space of these articles to precisely deﬁne

the mathematical objects that we deal with (manifolds, connections, bundles). We are

concerned less with completeness and rigour than with enticing the reader into a beautiful

subject. A full appreciation of even this popular article would need some familiarity with

modern diﬀerential geometry and the standard model of elementary particle physics. The

hurried reader is advised to read this article impressionistically and not worry too much

about the technical details. A less hurried reader may be motivated to try the suggested

reading below to pick up the necessary background to appreciate the mathematical ideas

2

described here and how they are used in physics. While reading this article, you may want

to keep pencil and paper handy so you can check some of the formulae. Also required are

string, a pair of scissors, glue (or some less messy substitute like cellotape or a stapler) and

a ball. Almost any soft ball will do, like a tennis or basket ball. If you are not the sporting

type, try and steal a ball from a child you know. Using your hands to play with models will

make the subject come alive as no mathematical formulae can.

To continue with the elementary exposition, now consider a special case. Pull the loop
of string taut in the shape of a triangle with vertices ABC. The tangent vector ˆt (and

so θ) remains constant along the lines AB, BC and CA but swings abruptly through the

exterior angles α1, α2, α3 at the vertices A, B and C respectively (Fig.1). Adding up the

total rotation of the tangent vector we ﬁnd that

2π = (π − A) + (π − B) + (π − C)

(2)

where we write A, B, C for the interior angles at the vertices A, B, C respectively. From (2)

follows the equation A + B + C = π that you learned at your mother’s knee: the sum of the

interior angles of a plane triangle is two right angles! Elementary, yes, but it has in it the

germ of deeper ideas to come. The reader is invited to puzzle over the following questions.

What happens if the string is laid on the table so that it crosses itself as for example, a ﬁgure

of eight? What happens if the string is laid not on a ﬂat table but on the curved surface of a

globe? How does one deﬁne the total rotation of the tangent vector? Is it still a topological

quantity? What happens if you suppose that the loop is inﬁnitesimal so that the globe can

be approximated by a plane? What happens if you expand the loop (say it is elastic) and

shrink it back to a small loop on the other side of the globe? A little reﬂection will show

that these simple questions can be pursued in very interesting directions. Let us now return

to our main theme: the connection between local and global quantities in mathematics and

physics.

Consider a sphere S (you have one near you, the surface of the ball) of radius r embedded

in three dimensional space. The curvature of S (the Gaussian curvature which is also called

the intrinsic curvature) is given by 1/r2 and we have the easily checked result

where dA = r2 sin θdθdφ in standard polar co-ordinates. Now deform the ball by squeezing

it. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that (3) still holds true. One can understand this

(3)

κdA = 1

(4)

(5)

result as follows. At every point on the sphere S with local co-ordinates (x1, x2), there is

a unit normal ˆn(x1, x2) which points out of the sphere. If (x1, x2) are varied over a small

region of (signed) area dA, the unit normal varies over a signed area dAˆn on the sphere

of directions. The Gaussian curvature is in fact a measure of this variation and can be

expressed as

κ =

dAˆn
dA

(The reader who is not familiar with Gaussian curvature is invited to check for herself (using

(4)) that the Gaussian curvature is zero for cylinders and planes[1], positive for spheres and

eggshells, and negative for saddles and some parts of ﬂower vases.) Thus, the Gaussian

curvature is a real number and a geometric quantity describing the local curving of the

sphere. However, its integral over the sphere is given by

κdA =

dAˆn

dAˆn = 1

since the unit normal “winds once around” the sphere of normals when the sphere is traversed

once. Just as in the case of the loop of string, we ﬁnd that although the integrand is local

and geometrical, the integral is a topological quantity which being an integer, does not

change under small variations. While deforming the ball one creates non- uniformities in

the curvature. However, every decrease in the curvature is compensated by an increase

somewhere else so that the integral remains unchanged.

The Chern Weil theorem is a general mathematical result of a similar nature dealing

with connections on ﬁbre bundles. A ﬁbre bundle is a space which is locally a product of

two spaces. A simple example of a ﬁbre bundle is a M¨obius strip. To make your very own

bundles, you can use a xerox copy of Figure 2. Cut along the dark black lines to get four

strips. Taking a strip at a time, hold the two ends of each strip against the light and align

the paper so that the square, triangle and circle overlay the square, triangle and circle at the

other end. Make sure that the triangle is properly oriented. For the second strip (B) you

will have to turn one of the ends around once to do this. Glue the ends in place. You are

now the proud owner of four ﬁbre bundles, labelled A,B,C and D! Take good care of them;

they may be worth a bundle someday. Let us compare the ﬁrst two, A and B a cylinder

and M¨obius strip respectively. Locally, the M¨obius strip B is indistinguishable from the

cylindrical strip A (one without the half twist), but it is globally diﬀerent. A bug walking

along a small part of the dotted line cannot tell the diﬀerence, but we know that the two

4

are quite diﬀerent spaces. For example, the M¨obius strip has only one side (try colouring

it) as opposed to two sides for a cylindrical strip. If you cut A and B all the way around

along the dotted line, you will ﬁnd that A falls into two components, but B does not! (What

happens if you repeat this operation on B?) The M¨obius strip is a twisted product of a

circle S1 and a line. The circle is called the base of the ﬁbre bundle and the line the ﬁbre.

More generally, a ﬁbre bundle consists of (E, B, F , Π), where E is the total space and Π is a

projection from E to the base space B and F is the ﬁbre. We require that any point b ∈ B
has a neighbourhood Ub so that Π−1(Ub) looks like Ub × F . This is the requirement that

the space is locally a product space. It may happen that globally E = B × F , in which

case, we say that the bundle is trivial. More generally, the bundle is only locally a product

not globally. The mathematical language of ﬁbre bundles turns out to be just right for

describing a class of physical theories called gauge theories. Gauge theories have turned out

to be extremely successful in describing the interactions between elementary particles. The

most familiar example of such a theory is electromagnetic theory, that you may have studied.

Mathematically, gauge theories (more precisely classical gauge theories) are connections on

ﬁbre bundles. A connection gives a rule for “parallel transport” or moving between ﬁbres.

See the accompanying article in this issue by Siddhartha Gadgil for more on this. You can

visualise a connection by using the paper strip models C and D, which are ﬁbre bundles with

a connection on it. The ﬁbres are shown as short grey lines across the strip. The rule for

horizontal motion in each of these bundles is: move parallel to the dark thin lines. With the

bundle C you ﬁnd that going all the way around the strip brings you back to the same point

on the ﬁbre: the connection is integrable. With the bundle D you come back to a diﬀerent

point on the same ﬁbre. This connection is not integrable. Integrable connections are ﬂat

and have vanishing curvature. Locally integrable connections have vanishing curvature, but

there may be global obstructions to integrability as in the case of the M¨obius strip. Can

you put an integrable connection on a M¨obius strip? Try it out and see.

We now turn to a simple example of Chern’s ideas in electromagnetic theory: the quan-

tisation condition for the charge of magnetic monopoles. A magnetic monopole is an object

from which magnetic ﬁeld lines emerge (just as electric ﬁeld lines emerge from an electrically

charged particle such as an electron). Magnetic monopoles have never been seen experimen-

tally, but have fascinated physicists over many generations. J.J. Thomson, P.A.M. Dirac,

M.N. Saha have studied monopoles in years past and more recently, G. ‘tHooft and A.M.

5

Polyakov have made seminal contributions to the subject. Dirac showed that if even a single

monopole exists, the electric charges of all partices must be multiples of a certain basic unit
of charge q = n( ¯h

(2g) or

qg = n¯h/(2)

(6)

where g is the magnetic charge of the monopole and ¯h is Planck’s constant. Even though

monopoles have not been seen, quantisation of electric charge is a fact of Nature. This lends

support to the idea that magnetic monopoles may exist. In fact, the standard model of the

weak nuclear interactions predicts monopoles of the kind studied by ‘tHooft and Polyakov.

In the modern gauge theoretic approach towards electromagnetic theory, one views the

magnetic ﬁelds (and electric ﬁelds) as analogous to curvature. The integral of the magnetic

ﬁeld over a closed surface S measures the total magnetic charge contained within that

(2q/¯h)

(7)

Thus we see by analogy that the general ﬂavour of Dirac’s quantisation condition (6) is

the same as the Chern-Weil result: the integral of the curvature over a closed surface is an

surface.

integer!

The Geometric Phase: One physical context where connections appear naturally in

physics is the geometric phase. This is a vast topic, interesting in its own right. Let us

brieﬂy recall the main ideas in the context of the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics.

A quantum system in a slowly changing environment displays a curious history dependent

geometric eﬀect: when the enviroment returns to its original state, the system also does, but

for an additional phase. The phase is a complex number of modulus one and experimentally

observable by quantum interference. This phenomenon is of geometric origin and is funda-

mentally due to the curvature of the ray space of quantum mechanics. (Ray space is the

Hilbert space modulo multiplication by non-zero complex numbers.) The geometric phase

provides us with a wealth of examples of globally non-trivial bundles, monopoles, instantons

and more.

parameter xi is slowly varied (over a time large compared to τ ), a system which is initially

in an eigenstate remains in an eigenstate of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Further, since

the energy levels do not cross, one can unambiguously keep track of the energy levels. For

example, the eigenspace corresponding to the lowest energy level is a well deﬁned notion.

If the parameters x are varied in a cyclic fashion, one returns to the original ray. The

eigenvalue equation(9) determines a ray in H for every x. This is a ﬁbre bundle over the

parameter space. This ﬁbre bundle has a natural connection which can be deduced from

the Schr¨odinger equation: move orthogonal to the ﬁbres in the Hilbert space inner product.

The curvature of this connection is Berry’s phase. Berry’s phase has been seen experimen-

tally in numerous situations. The simplest example is a spin half system which is described

in the Box. The connection occurring here is the same as that of the magnetic monopole.

We have come a long way from the loop of string we started with! The elementary

results we used to motivate this exposition are only the tip of an iceberg. The basic idea

is capable of considerable generalisation. Many of these ideas have application in modern

physics. Such results ﬁnd application in understanding gauge theories in many contexts,

from Chern-Simons gauge theories of the quantum Hall eﬀect to the non-Abelian gauge

theories of the standard model of elementary particle physics.

While one may object that magnetic monopoles are “science ﬁction” from the experimen-

tal viewpoint, the theoretical idea is very powerful and useful. The monopole conﬁgurations

appear naturally in the geometric phase of a two state quantum system. With the right

7

mathematical mappings, magnetic monopoles can be usefully employed to understand the

elastic properties of DNA! (see suggested reading below). Even if magnetic monopoles are

never directly seen in the laboratory, the theoretical ideas they bring with them are very

deep and capable of application. Physics is a deeply interconnected subject and we can

transport theoretical ideas from one context to another.

It is curious that the deep mathematical ideas of Chern-Weil theory which were discovered

with a purely mathematical motivation actually turn out to be useful in physics [11]. Nature

makes liberal use of geometric and topological objects. All the known interactions of Nature

use the idea of connections on ﬁbre bundles (gauge theories to physicists). This inﬂux of

mathematical ideas into physics is a good example of the symbiotic relation between the

two disciplines. Mathematical ideas often ﬁnd applications in physics and these applications

provide a further stimulus for development of the subject.

The reader may wonder why there is so much mathematics in physics. The physics that

we were taught at high school was of a more descriptive variety, with boring deﬁnitions to

remember and the shape of some round bottomed ﬂask used in some long forgotten exper-

iment! The present state of the subject is considerably diﬀerent and theoretical physicists

need to have a fairly good base in mathematics to even get started. This is due to the natu-

ral evolution of the subject and the fact that both theory and experiments are getting more

and more sophisticated. Throughout history, each generation of physicists has complained

that the next generation is far too mathematical. (In the 1930s, physicists used to complain

of the ‘gruppenpest”, the invasion of physics by group theory.) Physicists freely borrow

state of the art mathematical language to formulate their theories. However, it is important

to remember that theoretical physics is not mathematics. It uses mathematics to describe,

understand and predict the behaviour of the physical world. The use of mathematics is not

an end in itself, but a means to an end: a better understanding of Nature.

Box: Monopoles, M¨obius strips and Berry’s Phase

Let us consider a very simple example in which a globally non-trivial connection (gauge ﬁeld)

appears: a spin 1/2 system in an external magnetic ﬁeld. We regard the three components

of the magnetic ﬁeld as parameters xi, i = 1, 2, 3, which can be varied. Throughout this

box, the parameters xi represent co-ordinates on the base space B which is the parameter

space describing the inﬂuence of the environment, and not space-time as was the case in

the previous examples. We write the Hamiltonian, a 2 × 2, Hermitian matrix as H = xiσi,

where σi are the three Pauli matrices. These matrices are traceless and Hermitian and

satisfy σiσj + σjσi = 2δij, the Cliﬀord algebra. Since the eigenspaces of H are the same

for xi and λxi (only the eigenvalue changes, not the eigenspace), it is enough to restrict

attention to the unit sphere S2 = {xi ∈ IR3|Σxixi = 1} in the parameter space. At each
point of S2, there is a two-dimensional, complex vector space IC2 of spin states on which the

Hamiltonian acts. Since H squares to unity, its eigenvalues are ±1. The subspace of positive

energy states {|v(x) >∈ C2|H(x)|v(x) >= |v(x) >} deﬁnes a line bundle over S2 (the Hopf

bundle). To compute the Berry potential which arises when the parameters xi are varied,
note that H(x) = h(x)σ3h−1(x), where h(x) is deﬁned by

h(x) =

1 + Hσ3
2(1 + x3)

,

q

(11)

at all points except the south pole, where x3 = −1. If we pick a normalised positive energy

state |vN > at the north pole, which satisﬁes σ3|vN >= |vN >, |v(x) >= h(x)|vN > is

a normalised positive energy state all over the sphere (except the south pole).

(Similar

considerations also apply to the south polar patch, which excludes the north pole). The
gauge potential describing the connection is A =< v(x)d|v(x) >=< vN |h−1dh|vN > and

its ﬁeld strength is F = dA. It is easily seen that this ﬁeld strength describes a magnetic

monopole situated at the origin of xi, which has been excised from the parameter space.

This magnetic monopole satisﬁes the Dirac quantisation condition with n = 1.

Consider the slice x2 = 0. In this special case, we can write H(θ) = cos θσ3 + sin θσ1. Or

in the standard basis for Pauli matrices,

As θ goes from 0 to 2π, the real symmetric matrix H(θ) traverses a loop and returns to

made with your hands.

In the last article we described some elementary occurrences of Chern’s ideas in physics.

We now treat a few more advanced topics from elementary particle physics. The standard

model of elementary particle physics relies heavily on “gauge theories”. Classically, gauge

theories are just connections on ﬁbre bundles, a structure that mathematicians like Chern

have studied. To see the relation between the mathematics and the physics, one needs to

view gauge theories from a slightly advanced point of view. Let us do this starting with

electrodynamics. Recall that electrodynamics is described by a vector potential Aµ(x),
where µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 labels the components of the 1 form A = Aµdxµ and xµ represent the

four co-ordinates of a space-time point. Let ψ(x) be the wave function of a particle with

charge q. The theory enjoys a symmetry called “gauge invariance”. The Lagrangian of
electrodynamics is invariant under the transformations: Aµ → Aµ + u−1∂µu and ψ → uψ,

where u = exp iqχ(x) and χ(x) is an arbitrary real function of x. u(x) is a complex number

of modulus 1.

i.e an element of the group U(1).

In modern language, electrodynamics

is a U(1) gauge theory. Note that there is no gauge invariant meaning to comparing the

wave function at diﬀerent space-time points. The ordinary derivative ∂µψ is not gauge

invariant. However, the co-variant derivative Dµψ = ∂µψ − Aµψ is a gauge invariant object.

This requires the use of additional structure, the vector potential Aµ. Mathematically this

additional structure is called a connection. This is one of the most important mathematical

ideas to have entered physics and this is an important focus of this article.

Mathematically, we view the complex valued wave function of the charged particle as

taking values in a ﬁbre, a vector space of one complex dimension. A connection gives us

a rule for comparing wavefunctions on ﬁbres attached to diﬀerent points. This rule is in

general not integrable: given three points (a, b, c) in B, with ﬁbres Fa, Fb, Fc, comparing

Fa with Fb and Fb with Fc is not the same as directly comparing Fa with Fc. This lack

of integrability is locally captured by the curvature F of the connection, which is in local

co-ordinates, the commutator of the covariant derivative: Fµν = DµDν − DνDµ. F is an

antisymmetric tensor and therefore a 2 form (see Box 1).

Gauge theories are generalisations of electrodynamics and play an important role in the

standard model of elementary particle physics and also in gravity. Quantum Chromodynam-

ics (QCD) the gauge theory of the strong nuclear interactions is a non-Abelian gauge theory

based on the non-Abelian group SU(3) and the Weinberg-Salam model of the electroweak

interactions is based on the gauge group SU(2) × U(1). Gravity also can be fomulated as a

2

gauge theory (based on a non-compact group) but applying quantum mechanics to it is no-

toriously diﬃcult and presently an open problem. For a gauge theory based on the group G,

the vector potential takes values in the adjoint representation of the group (or more simply,
it is a matrix valued object). Gauge transformations are written as A → u−1Au − u−1du,

ψ → uψ, where the “wave function” ψ is now a vector in a representation of G. The

“curvature” (or ﬁeld strength to physicists) is given by

F = dA + A ∧ A

(1)

which also takes values in the adjoint representation of G. (Like A, F is also matrix val-

ued.) In studying gauge theories, we often ﬁnd that we have to deal with connections with

globally nontrivial properties. In the ﬁrst already seen one, the magnetic monopole, which

is an example of the ﬁrst Chern class c1. We now describe a few more globally nontrivial

connections.

The instanton: The instanton is a topologically non-trivial gauge ﬁeld conﬁguration

which represents tunnelling between states of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) the the-

ory of the strong nuclear interactions based on the group SU(3). To simplify matters con-

sider instead an SU(2) gauge theory, without Fermionic matter. An important state in the

quantum theory is the vacuum state, deﬁned as the state which minimises the Hamiltonian

(or energy). It is plausible that one can learn about the quantum vacuum by considering

small quantum ﬂuctuations about classical static conﬁgurations (independent of the time
co-ordinate x0) which minimise energy. These are given by F = 0 or A = −U −1dU and thus
deﬁne a map from IR3 to G. ~x ∈ IR3 to U(~x) ∈ G. Boundary conditions at inﬁnity of IR3

require that U → Id as |~x| → ∞. So we really have a map from S3 (the one point compacti-
ﬁcation of IR3) to SU(2), which also has global topology S3. These maps fall into topological

classes which cannot be continuously deformed into one another. The classes are charac-

terised by an integer n, the number of times U “winds” around SU(2) as ~x winds around

S3. There appear to be multiple classical vacuua as would happen even in a simple quantum

mechanical problem if the potential energy function is periodic like cos x. Classically these

vacuua are degenerate (they all have the same energy). But quantum mechanically, there is

tunnelling between them. This tunnelling lifts the degeneracy and reveals the true vacuum

state as a particular superposition (characterised by θ the vacuum angle) of the classical

vacuua. This is entirely analogous to Bloch states in a periodic potential. The phenomenon

3

of tunnelling is described in Euclidean IR4 by analytically continuing to imaginary time. In

the path integral formulation of quantum ﬁeld theory, one regards physical amplitudes as

an integral over all classical ﬁeld conﬁgurations (“sum over histories”). The amplitude for

tunnelling is dominated by the saddle points, the solutions to the classical equations of mo-

tion. These are called instantons. They describe tunnelling between topologically distinct

vacuua. These gauge ﬁeld conﬁgurations are non-trivial bundles on S4 (the one point com-
pactiﬁcation of IR4). The instanton solution connecting vacuua n and n + k is characterised

by its “topological charge” or winding number

where N is a normalisation constant. Notice again that the left hand side is the integral of

a geometrical quantity, the Chern density trF ∧ F , but the right hand side is an integer and

topological! The instanton is an example of the second Chern class. The monopole and the

instanton illustrate the ﬁrst two Chern classes. There are higher order invariant polynomials

in F describing the other Chern classes.

The chiral anomaly: Another context where the Chern density TrF ∧ F appears is the

Chiral anomaly, which arises when one couples a gauge theory to massless fermions. At a
classical level, massless fermions have two conserved currents jµ = ¯ψγµψ, the electric charge
5 = ¯ψγ5γµψ the chiral current. Both currents are conserved: they satisfy the
current and jµ
equation ∂µjµ = ∂µjµ
5 = 0. The conservation of these currents follows from N¨other’s theorem

from symmetries of the classical theory. However, quantum ﬁeld theories have an inﬁnite

number of degrees of freedom and need regularisation in order to produce ﬁnite answers.

The regularisation procedure results in a loss of chiral symmetry. One ﬁnds that the chiral

current is no longer conserved, but

∂µjµ

5 = CǫµναβTrFµνFαβ,

(3)

where C is a constant depending on the couplings and the number and chirality of the

Fermions and ǫµναβ is the completely antisymmetric tensor. The reader will recognise the

right hand side of (3), the chiral anomaly, as the Chern density TrF ∧ F . The chiral

anomaly was ﬁrst discovered in perturbation theory and only later was its global topological

signiﬁcance realised. There are clear physical consequences resulting from the chiral anomaly.

The decay of the π meson into two photons (π0 → γγ) is forbidden by classical symmetry,

but is in fact observed in nature and understood using the chiral anomaly.

We just saw that an anomaly in the chiral current has physical consequences. However

if an anomaly occurs in a current corresponding to a gauge symmetry, the theory becomes

inconsistent. This can be used to impose constraints on the allowed matter ﬁelds. The

matter ﬁelds must be so chosen that the anomaly cancels out (i.e.

the analogue of the

constant C in equation (3) is zero) and doesn’t spoil the conservation of charge. Anomaly

cancellation is an important principle in present day particle physics and used in string

theory to restrict the allowed matter content.

Chern-Simons theory: The Chern density TrF ∧F can locally be written as an exterior

derivative of a 3 form. Let us restrict to Abelian U(1) gauge theory where F = dA. We have

TrF ∧F = TrdA∧dA = d[TrA∧dA], where we have used Poincare’s lemma dd = 0. The three

form TrA ∧ dA is called the Chern-Simons form. Its integral over a closed three manifold

TrA ∧ dA is gauge invariant. The Chern-Simons invariant can be used as a Lagrangian

R
to describe 3 dimensional ﬁeld theories. Such ﬁeld theories have found application in the

Quantum Hall eﬀect. The Chern-Simons action describes a gauge ﬁeld theory with no local

degrees of freedom, a “topological ﬁeld theory”. Such quantum ﬁeld theories have proved

useful, not only in physics, but also in mathematics as they lead to a better understanding

of knots!

The Geometric Phase: In the ﬁrst part of this article, we described the geometric

phase and showed how it leads to a natural U(1) connection. Berry’s phase also leads to

non-Abelian connections. These occur if the eigenspace for each eigenvalue is of dimension

more than one. Examples are sytems with Kramers’degeneracy, which arises in Fermionic

systems with time -reversal symmetry. In such systems, the time reversal operator T squares

to −1. We can think of i, j = T and k = ij as generators of Hamilton’s quaternions and we

now have quaternionic Hilbert spaces rather than complex ones. Since quaternions do not

commute, we get a nonabelian connection. Box 3 brings out globally nontrivial connections

within the context of the geometric phase. This part of the article is more technical and

needs working through.

It often happens that mathematicians study structures, which turn out to be exactly

right for describing the real world. One instance of this is Riemannian geometry, which

was developed before Einstein used it in General Relativity. Another example is the idea

of a connection. This idea too was developed by mathematicians quite independently of

the real world. After many eﬀorts to understand the world of atoms, nucleii and quarks,

5

physicists have realised that connections provide the right description. Are there other such

mathematical objects waiting in the wings to enter the stage of theoretical physics? Only

time (whatever that is!) will tell.

Box 1: Diﬀerential Forms

Forms are generally found just under integral signs. In a multiple integral (say d dimen-

sional), one slices up the region of integration into parallelopiped cells. The integral can be

split up into contributions, one from each cell and this is proportional to the d volume of

the cell. The d volume of a cell is naturally expressed as a determinant. For example, the
volume of a three dimensional parallelopiped with sides (~a,~b, ~c) is ~a.(~b × ~c) or

Determinants are antisymmetric objects and switch sign when two rows (say, a and b above)

are exchanged. p-forms are antisymmetric tensors of rank p. p-forms can be integrated over

p dimensional manifolds. For example, 0 forms are just ordinary functions and “integrating”

a 0 form over a 0 dimensional manifold (a point) just consists of evaluating the function

at that point. 1-forms are like the vector potential in electrodynamics and the line integral

Aµdxµ is a familiar object from electromagnetic theory. An example of a 2- form is a

Forms provide us with a particularly powerful language for expressing physical ideas. Unlike

R

other tensors, diﬀerential forms can be integrated (that’s how we introduced them) and also

diﬀerentiated. Simply diﬀerentiate the p-form in local co-ordinates and then antisymmetrise

with respect to the p+1 indices. If α is a p form, then dα is a p+1 form. Antisymmetrisation

results in the identity ddα = 0, which is called Poincare’s lemma. This identity includes

familiar identities like curl.grad = 0 and div.curl = 0. Forms can be multiplied together:

just multiply the p and q forms and then antisymmetrise in all p + q indices. They can

be contracted with vectors to produce lower rank forms p − 1 forms. These manipulations

do not require any metric on the manifold. E. Cartan was a great advocate of the use of

diﬀerential forms. S.S. Chern came into contact with Cartan early in his life and was very

much inﬂuenced by him. The use of forms has been particulary fruitful in physics. For

instance, electrodyanamics lends itself easily to a formulation in terms of diﬀerntial forms.

The formulation of supergravity takes the Einstein-Cartan theory (which is general relativity

souped up with forms) as a starting point.

Box 2: Local Versus Global Description
Although in the main article, we have used co-ordinates xµ, these need not be globally

deﬁned all over space time. It is enough if the spacetime manifold (which is the same as

the base space B) can be covered by charts , each of which admits local co-ordinates. When

charts overlap, we require that the co-ordinate transformation connecting diﬀerent systems

of co-ordinates be compatible. Similarly, the vector potential A may only be deﬁned in local

patches. These patches can be “sewn together” like a quilt to produce the global picture. In

the overlap of patches, we require that there is a gauge transformation connecting diﬀerent

vector potentials. Mathematicians have a global way of describing this structure: one thinks

of a ﬁbre bundle with U(1) as ﬁbre and B as the base. (The ﬁbre is U(1) because we are

concerned here with U(1) connections as in electromagneism. More generally, the ﬁbre is

some group manifold.) Replacing the ﬁbre with some other group such as SU(2), SU(3) of

SU(N) leads to non-Abelian gauge theories. In the mathematical description, a connection

is a rule for horizontally lifting curves in B to E. In general the horizontal lift of closed curves

in B may be open in E. One returns to the same ﬁbre but to a diﬀerent point on the ﬁbre.

This means that the connection is not integrable. A local measure of the non-integrability

of the connection is the curvature, which physicists identify with generalised electric and

magnetic ﬁelds.

Box 3: Instantons and Berry’s Phase

The geometric phase provides us with examples of globally non-trivial bundles in physics.

To see instantons, we need to consider a four state system with pair wise degenerate energy

levels. The “phase” here is not an Abelian U(1) phase but a non-Abelian U(2) phase.

Consider the ﬁve dimensional Cliﬀord algebra generated by {Γi, i = 1...5} ΓiΓj +ΓjΓi = 2δij.

These generators can be realised as 4 × 4 Dirac matrices (γµ, γ5). We consider the system
described by the Hamiltonian H = xiΓi, where the xi now span a ﬁve-dimensional parameter
space IR5 − {0}. Such a system can be realised experimentally in Nuclear Quadrupole

resonance (NQR). We need only restrict our attention to the unit sphere in parameter space.

The positive energy subspace of H deﬁnes a IC2 bundle over S4. Choosing an orthonormal

frame in each eigenspace gives an U(2) bundle over S4. Just as before, we notice that
H(x) = h(x)Γ5h−1(x), where h(x) is now deﬁned by
1 + HΓ5
2(1 + x5)

h(x) =

A is in fact, traceless and so is really an SU(2) connection. Its ﬁeld strength is given by

F = dA + A ∧ A and represents an instanton of charge k = 1. Globally the Instanton bundle

is S7 and the ﬁbres are S3 and the base is S4.

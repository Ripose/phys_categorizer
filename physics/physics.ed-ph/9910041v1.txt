Abstract

Education is a prerequisite to master the challenges of space science and
technology. Eﬀorts to understand and control space science and technology
are necessarily intertwined with social expressions in the cultures where sci-
ence and technology is carried out (Pyenson [1]). The United Nations is
leading an eﬀort to establish regional Centres for Space Science and Technol-
ogy Education in major regions on Earth. The status of the establishment
of such institutions in Asia and the Paciﬁc, Africa, Latin America and the
Caribbean, Western Asia, and Eastern Europe is brieﬂy described in this
article.

1. United Nations Programme on Space Applications
The United Nations Programme on Space Applications was established in
1971 on the recommendation of the ﬁrst United Nations Conference on the
Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE I)[2] and the Pro-
gramme was expanded and its mandate broadened in UNISPACE II (1982)
[3] and the recently concluded UNISPACE III [4] Conferences. Fulﬁlling one
element of the Programme’s mandate, more than 150 workshops with ap-
proximately 8000 participants have been organized since its establishment.
Following the need of developing countries and taking into account the space-
related agenda of the Programme, the majority of workshops focussed on
core disciplines: remote sensing and geographic information system, satellite
communications and geo-positioning system, satellite meteorology and global
climate, and space and atmospheric sciences [5]. Despite the success of these
workshops in the initiation of regional and international cooperation and the

development of space science and technology, particularly for the beneﬁt of
developing countries, in the 1980’s the limitations of short-term activities
were recognized and called for the need of building long-term regional capac-
ity in space science and technology and its applications [6]. Subsequently,
in 1988, under the auspices of the Programme, a project to establish centres
for space science and technology education at the regional level was initiated
[7]. A unique element of this project was that the Centres were envisaged to
be established in developing countries for the beneﬁt of regional cooperation,
particularly between the developing countries.

2. United Nations General Assembly Resolutions
The General Assembly of the United Nations, in its resolution 45/72 of 11
December 1990, endorsed the recommendation of the Working Group of the
Whole of the Scientiﬁc and Technical Subcommittee, as approved by the
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) [8], that: “...
the United Nations should lead, with the active support of its specialized
agencies and other international organizations, an international eﬀort to es-
tablish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing
national/regional educational institutions in the developing countries” [9].
Subsequently, the General Assembly, in its resolution 50/27 of 6 December
1995, also endorsed the recommendation of COPUOS that “these centres
be established on the basis of aﬃliation to the United Nations as early as
possible and that such aﬃliation would provide the centres with the necessary
recognition and would strengthen the possibilities of attracting donors and
of establishing academic relationships with national and international space-
related institutions” [10].

3. Status of Establishing and Operating the Regional Centres
At the occasion of the UNISPACE III Conference (19-30 July 1999, Vienna,
Austria), the status of the operation and establishment of the regional Cen-
tres was reviewed as part of the intergovernmental meetings and the technical
forum of this Conference [4].
Since its inauguration in India in 1995, the regional Centre for Space Science
and Technology Education in Asia and the Paciﬁc has successfully conducted
four post-graduate courses on remote sensing and geographic information
system; two courses on satellite communications; and a course each on the
following topics: satellite meteorology and global climate; and space science.

Each of the courses was inaugurated through a research level workshop on
the respective topic supported through regular activities of the United Na-
tions Programme on Space Applications. Upon completion of the nine-month
course in each activity, the scholars have carried out a one-year applica-
tions/research project in their home countries. In agreement with resolution
45/72, this Centre takes advantage of the intellectual resources and facilities
of three renowned space-related institutions: (i) the Indian Institute of Re-
mote Sensing, Dehradun, (ii) the Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad,
and (iii) the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad [15].
The regional Centre for Space Science and Technology - in French Language
- in Africa was inaugurated on 24 October 1998 in Casablanca, Morocco, and
is located at the Ecole Mohammadia d’Ingenieurs in Rabat.
The regional Centre for Space Science and Technology Education - in English
Language - in Africa was inaugurated on 24 November 1998 in Abuja, Nigeria,
and is located at Obafemi Awolowo University in Ile-Ife [16].
The inauguration of the regional Centre for Space Science and Technology
Education in Latin America and the Caribbean is expected to occur in 2000
in Brazil and Mexico. In preparation for the operation of the campus of the
Centre in Brazil, the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) is
already very active in carrying out a number of workshops for the beneﬁt of
States in the region.
An evaluation mission to Jordan and the Syrian Arab Republic was con-
ducted in 1998. The reports of the mission have been ﬁnalized in consulta-
tion with the Governments of Jordan and the Syrian Arab Republic, with a
view to selecting a host country for a regional Centre in Western Asia, which
is expected to occur shortly after the UNISPACE III Conference.
In 1995, the Network of Space Science and Technology Education and Re-
search Institutions for States of Central-Eastern and South-Eastern Europe
was established [11]. A technical study mission to Bulgaria, Greece, Hun-
gary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Turkey was carried out in 1998. The
mission undertook a technical study and provided an informative report that
will be used in determining, in each country visited, an agreed framework
for the operation of such a Network. Each country designated space science
and technology related core and associated institutions, all of them with a
long and successful history in research and applications of space science and
technology, which are being part of this Network.

4. Governing Boards and Advisory Committees of the Centres
Each Centre shall aspire to be a highly reputable regional institution, which,
as the needs arise, and as directed by the Centre’s Governing Board, may
grow into a network of specialized and internationally acclaimed aﬃliate
nodes. Because resolution 45/72 speciﬁcally limits the role of the United Na-
tions to “lead, ..., an international eﬀort to establish regional centres”, it is
apparent that once a Centre is inaugurated, its Governing Board will assume
all decision-making and policy-formulating responsibilities for the Centre.
The Governing Board is the overall policy making body of each Centre and
consists of member States (within the region where the Centre is located),
that have agreed, through their endorsement of the Centre’s agreement, to
the goals and objectives of the Centre. The agreement of the Centre calls
for the establishment of an Advisory Committee that provides advise to the
Governing Board on all scientiﬁc and technical matters, particularly on the
Centre’s education curricula, and consists of experts in the ﬁeld of space
science and technology [12]. The United Nations serves the Centre and its
Governing Board and Advisory Committee in an advisory capacity. Gov-
erning Boards were established for the Centres in Asia and the Paciﬁc and
Africa. To date the Advisory Committee has been set up for the Centre in
Asia and the Paciﬁc.

5. Next Steps to Be Taken
During the deliberations of the UNISPACE III Conference, meetings were
held and presentations were delivered to chart the course for future measures
to continue furthering the regional Centres. In a meeting between represen-
tatives of the Centres in Asia and the Paciﬁc, Africa, and Latin America
and the Caribbean, the opinion was emphasized, that as a follow-up of the
Conference, closer and lively cooperation between the regional Centres needs
to be established already at this point of time. Particularly, the rich ex-
perience gained in the successful operation of the Centre in Asia and the
Paciﬁc as centre of excellence shall be made available to the Centres in all
other regions. It was further felt that all Centres, through the support of
the United Nations Oﬃce for Outer Space Aﬀairs and its Programme on
Space Applications, should urgently establish cooperation with international
organizations and institutions (among them COSPAR, IAU, ICTP, ISPRS,
ISU, TWAS), specialized agencies of the United Nations system (among them
FAO, IAEA, UNESCO, UNU, WHO, WMO), and the Economic and Social

Commissions of the respective region. The International Astronomical Union
(IAU) has undetaken ﬁrst steps in this direction [13]. The strong participa-
tion of developing countries in the technical forum activities of UNISPACE
III also brought to the attention of the Oﬃce for Outer Space Aﬀairs that
the Centre’s education curricula [12] may have to be supplemented with non-
core discipline elements focussing on space biology/medicine, devising small
satellite projects, microgravity, and other space-related topics.

6. UN/ESA Workshops on Basic Space Science
The establishment of the regional Centres is the sole project of the Pro-
gramme on Space Applications leading to “institutionalization” in the ﬁeld
of space science and technology. The operation of the Centres can be sup-
ported by the Programme in organizing some of its regular activities in close
cooperation with the Centres. In this connection it shall be recalled that it
was India in 1991, hosting the ﬁrst United Nations/European Space Agency
Workshop on Basic Space Science for the beneﬁt of Asia and the Paciﬁc at
ISRO in Bangalore, that inaugurated a series of worldwide workshops. Since
then such workshops were organized in Latin America and the Caribbean
(Costa Rica and Colombia 1992, Honduras 1997), Africa (Nigeria 1993),
Western Asia (Egypt 1994, Jordan 1999), Europe (Germany 1996, France
2000), and again in Asia and the Paciﬁc (Sri Lanka 1995) [14]. This series of
workshops led to the establishment of several education and research oriented
astronomical telescope facilities with a view to link them to the respective
regional Centres in the future. Already such a series of workshops, organized
in the ﬁeld of space science and technology, can lead to an appreciable ex-
pansion of cooperation between countries of a region and its regional Centre.

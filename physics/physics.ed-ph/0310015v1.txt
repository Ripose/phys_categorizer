INTRODUCTION

The simplest form of the adiabatic gas relation is the observation that the temperature of

a thermally insulated gas increases when it is compressed and decreases when it is expanded.

According to the historical review of this subject by Kuhn,1 the ﬁrst publication document-

ing this behavior was by the Scottish physician William Cullen in the mid 17th century.

Experimental observations were summarized by the relation P V γ = constant, where the

exponent γ was determined to exceed unity. The deviation of γ from unity is what allowed

Sadi Carnot to develop his eponymous cycle. (Apparently Carnot did not have the correct

value of γ, but the use of an incorrect value did not aﬀect his fundamental result that heat

engine eﬃciency depends only on inlet and outlet temperatures.)

Serious attempts to develop a theoretical explanation for the adiabatic gas relation were

undertaken by Laplace, Poisson, and others in the early 19th century, but no single individ-

ual has been identiﬁed as being the ﬁrst to provide the correct theoretical explanation. Since

the mid-19th century development of thermodynamics, the adiabatic gas relation has been

established from ﬁrst principles using thermodynamic arguments. The standard thermody-

namic derivation is based on considering the temperature change of the gas in a cylinder at

constant pressure or constant volume while taking into account speciﬁc heats at constant

pressure and constant volume.2

The purpose of this paper is to show that the adiabatic gas relation P V γ = constant

is a direct consequence of an important property of periodic mechanical motion, namely

adiabatic invariance. Although the word adiabatic is used in both the mechanical and

thermodynamic contexts, its meaning in the mechanical context diﬀers from its meaning in

the thermodynamic context3 because the concept of heat does not exist in the mechanical

context. The derivation presented here provides insight into the fundamental microscopic

dynamics underlying adiabaticity. The derivation will ﬁrst be presented for molecules with

no internal degrees of freedom and then extended to molecules with internal degrees of

freedom. Two standard properties of an ideal gas will be invoked repeatedly, namely, the

properties of an ideal gas occupying a volume V do not depend on the shape of the volume,

and collisions cause all properties of an ideal gas to become isotropic.

II. MOLECULES WITHOUT INTERNAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM

A molecule with no internal degrees of freedom may be represented by a point particle.

Consider the situation sketched in Fig. 1 where a point particle bounces back and forth with

speed v between two walls. The two walls are denoted as 1 and 2 and are separated by a

distance L. Wall 1 is stationary while wall 2 approaches wall 1 with speed u where u << v.

Both u and v are speeds, not velocities, that is, u and v are both positive quantities and

leftward motion is denoted by an explicit minus sign. Wall 2 therefore moves in the lab

frame with a velocity −u.

FIG. 1: Wall 2 moves to the left with speed u. The particle has speed v. The distance between

the walls is L.

The critical physical assumption is that the particle bounces elastically from both walls.

This microscopic assumption corresponds precisely to the macroscopic adiabatic prescription

that the gas is thermally insulated from its surroundings. If particles bounced inelastically

from the walls, the temperature of the walls would change and the gas would not be thermally

insulated from the external world.

The transformation from the lab frame to the frame of wall 2 requires adding u to the

lab frame velocity; the reverse transformation requires subtracting u from the velocity in

the frame of wall 2. In the frame of wall 2, the particle approaches wall 2 with velocity v + u

and after reﬂection has the velocity −v − u. By transforming back to the lab frame, the lab

3

frame velocity after reﬂection is −v − 2u. The change in the particle speed in the lab frame

due to reﬂection from wall 2 is therefore

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

∆v = 2u.

tb = 2L/v.

Now consider the time for the particle to execute one cycle of bouncing between walls 1

and 2. The distance traveled by the particle on starting from wall 1, reﬂecting from wall

2, and then returning to wall 1 is 2L, and so the time to travel this distance is the bounce

time

cycle.

Equation (2) can be used to calculate the change in inter-wall distance during one complete

bounce cycle. Because wall 2 is approaching wall 1, this change is negative and is given by

∆L = −utb = −2Lu/v.

The presumption u << v combined with Eq. (3) implies that |∆L|/L << 1, and so we

do not need to take into account changes in either v or in L during a bounce cycle when

calculating tb; that is, tb is well-deﬁned even though both L and v change during a bounce

The combination of Eqs. (1) and (3) gives the relation

showing that ∆(vL) = 0, or

L∆v + v∆L = 0,

vL = constant.

The quantity vL is called an adiabatic invariant4,5 and indicates conservation of the phase-

space area enclosed by the phase-space trajectory of periodic motion. This invariance is a

fundamental property of the periodic motion of Hamiltonian systems in which there exists

a slowly changing parameter (the word slowly in our case corresponds to u << v). Energy

is not conserved and scales as v2 ∼ 1/L2.

Now assume that the particle bounces in three dimensions between the walls of a cube

with sides of length L, where, for each of the three dimensions, one wall approaches its

opposite partner as we have discussed. Thus, the cube decreases in a self-similar fashion as

4

shown in Fig. 2. Equation (5) holds for each of the three dimensions and can be generalized

as

Hence,

xL2 = constant, v2
v2

yL2 = constant, v2

z L2 = constant.

v2L2 = (v2

x + v2

y + v2

z )L2 = constant.

A large number of non-interacting particles in such a cube can be considered as an ideal gas

with temperature T ∼ <v2> where < . . . > denotes an average over all the particles. The

average of Eq. (7) over all particles thus gives

Because the volume of the cube is V = L3, Eq. (8) becomes

The ideal gas law gives the relation

T L2 = constant.

T V 2/3 = constant.

P V = NkT,

P V 5/3 = constant.

where P is the pressure, N is the number of particles, and k is Boltzmann’s constant. If we

use Eq. (10) to substitute for T in Eq. (9), we obtain the adiabatic relation

Equation (11) is the sought-after relation, but the derivation has two important restrictions:

the cube dimensions changed in a self-similar fashion as in Fig. 2 and the particles were

assumed to be non-interacting.

We now repeat the derivation, but this time allow for collisions between particles and

also for non-self-similar changes in the dimensions of the volume. As before, the volume is

assumed to be thermally isolated from the surroundings, which means that all reﬂections

from the walls are energy-conserving in the frames of the respective walls from which reﬂec-

tion occurs. The combined assumptions of thermal isolation and existence of interparticle

collisions means that the ﬁnal state after an arbitrary change in the linear dimensions of

the system is independent of how the change was made. Thus, we are free to choose any

sequence of steps we wish when going from an initial state to some speciﬁed ﬁnal state,

provided that our two assumptions stated above hold. The following discussion presents a

sequence chosen to elucidate the microscopic physics.

We start with a system that has an arbitrary initial shape, initial volume V0, initial

temperature T0; we want to determine the temperature T when the volume changes to V .

We ﬁrst deform the shape of the volume V0 as shown in Fig. 3(a) so that the volume becomes

rectangular with linear dimensions Lx0, Ly0, and Lz0 with V0 = Lx0Ly0Lz0. This shape

deformation at constant volume does not change the initial gas temperature T0 because

ideal gas properties are independent of the shape of the volume. Further, because the

linear dimensions are arbitrary, we set Lx0 suﬃciently small that the bounce time in the x

direction is shorter than the nominal interparticle collision time τc, that is, we set Lx0 such

that 2Lx0/v << τc. Thus, particles bounce many times in the x direction before they make

a collision with another particle.

we may write

Next we decrease just the x dimension as shown in Fig. 3(b). Because dvx = −vxdLx/Lx,

However, because only the x dimension is being changed, V ∝ Lx, and so this collisionless

change can be written as

is Lx. Because there are no collisions, the y and z directions are decoupled from the x-

direction, and so there are no changes in the y- or z-direction kinetic energies.

After this decrease, we then wait a few collision times so that collisions have a chance

to equilibrate the change in kinetic energy among the three directions. After collisions have

The combined process of decreasing x and then waiting for collisions to equilibrate the

energy gives, using Eqs. (13a) and (14a),

or, upon integrating,

v2 scales the same as v2

Because the collisions have equilibrated energy amongst the three dimensions of motion,
x and because T scales as v2, we again obtain Eq. (9), which again
leads to Eq. (11). Once the system has attained its desired ﬁnal volume, it can be deformed

at constant volume into whatever shape is desired. Thus, the relation P V 5/3 = constant

holds for any change in the volume and any shape if there are collisions and if the system is

thermally isolated.

INTERNAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM

The analysis can now be extended to rigid diatomic and polyatomic molecules. As is well-

known, a rigid diatomic molecule has two additional degrees of freedom due to rotational

motion relative to the center of mass (there is negligible rotational energy about the axis

connecting the two atoms comprising the molecule). On the other hand, a polyatomic

molecule has three additional rotational degrees of freedom because it can rotate in all three

directions about the center of mass. We let n be the number of degrees of freedom so n = 3

for a monatomic molecule as discussed in Sec. II, n = 5 for a diatomic molecule, and n = 6

for a polyatomic molecule. The term “degrees of freedom” is deﬁned as the number of ways

that collisions can share an increment in kinetic energy supplied to one direction of motion

amongst all possible types of motions of a molecule. We deﬁne Tx, Ty, Tz as the kinetic

energy due to center of mass motion in the x, y, z directions of a diatomic or polyatomic

where M is the molecular mass and vx, vy, and vz are center of mass velocities. For a

diatomic molecule, we deﬁne I1 and I2 as the additional kinetic energies due to rotational

motions relative to the center of mass for the two allowed degrees of freedom of a diatomic

molecule. For a polyatomic molecule we similarly deﬁne I1, I2, I3 as the kinetic energies of

the three allowed degrees of freedom due to rotational motions relative to the center of mass.

Consider now decreasing Lx on a time scale shorter than the collision time for a diatomic

molecule. In this case, Eqs. (13a)-(13c) become

After the collisionless decrease, we wait for collisions to equilibrate the change in kinetic

IV. DISCUSSION

Thus γ = 5/3 for a monatomic molecule, γ = 7/5 for a diatomic molecule, and γ = 4/3 for

Adiabatic gas behavior is closely related to the one-dimensional periodic motion of a

particle in a slowly changing system. This motion satisﬁes the fundamental relation, vL =

constant, which is a limiting form of the general adiabatic conservation rule for slowly
changing periodic motion of a Hamiltonian system,4 namely that H pdq = constant, where

p and q are generalized coordinates and the integral is over one period of oscillation. The

vL = constant relation is the basis for Fermi acceleration,6 the process by which cosmic

charged particles can be accelerated to extreme energies when they bounce back and forth

between converging magnetic ﬁelds playing the role of converging walls.

As mentioned, it is the elastic bouncing of the particle from the walls that makes the

process adiabatic; if the bouncing were inelastic, the wall would heat up in which case the gas

would not be thermally isolated. The vL = constant relation also is intrinsic to the WKB

approximation of a simple harmonic oscillator, for example, a pendulum with slowly varying

length or equivalently the Schr¨odinger equation for a particle in a slowing changing potential

well. When applied to the pendulum problem, the WKB approximation involves solving the

equation d2x/dt2 + ω2(t)x = 0, where ω(t) is a time-dependent frequency.7 The frequency

10

ω(t) is essentially the inverse of the bounce time deﬁned in Eq. (2) and so ω(t) ∼ t−1
b ∼ v/L.
Because vL = constant, it is seen that v2/ω(t) ∼ constant and so the harmonic oscillator

energy increases in proportion to the frequency. Energy is not conserved, but the ratio of

energy to frequency is.

When there are non-self-similar volumetric changes and collisions, our derivation of the

adiabatic gas law from mechanical considerations requires separating the process into a

sequence of inﬁnitesimal steps where each step has two successive sub-steps, namely a one-

dimensional change in volume which adiabatically (in the mechanical sense) changes the

center of mass kinetic energy of the changed dimension only, and then a collision-mediated

sharing of this energy change among all allowed degrees of freedom. This point of view

clearly shows why diatomic and polyatomic molecules have a diﬀerent γ from monatomic

molecules.

Finally, it is worth addressing a possible confusion regarding whether adiabatic processes

are fast or slow: adiabatic processes are characterized both ways, depending on the context.

In order for an adiabatic invariant to exist in the context of classical mechanics, the system

must change slowly, that is, the change of the bounce time per bounce must be small

compared to the bounce time.8 From the thermodynamic point of view, an adiabatic process

must be fast compared to the time for heat to leave the system, that is, the change in the

dimensions of the conﬁguration must occur faster than the time for walls to heat up due

to inelasticities of the reﬂecting particles. Possible confusion is avoided by realizing that

adiabatic processes must be slow compared to particle bounce times so as to satisfy the

u << v assumption, but fast compared to heat loss times so as to satisfy the assumption

that the particle bounces elastically from the wall.

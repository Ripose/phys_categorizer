Abstract.
It has been found that some text-books show LC-oscillators that may
not work as assumed. Thus, the typical example showing a LC-oscillator driven by a
voltage operational-ampliﬁer is simply wrong. The diﬃculty stems from the fact that
such oscillators are normally built to work with transconductance- not with voltage-
ampliﬁers. Such a diﬃculty however, can be readily solved by connecting a resistor in
series with the so-called frequency-determining network.

LC-oscillators using voltage-ampliﬁers

As is shown in text-books of elementary electronics, a sinusoidal oscillator circuit
contains an ampliﬁer stage and a feedback-loop as appears in Fig.1 (a) [1, 2]. This type
of circuits are often analysed by using the voltage transfer-coeﬃcient of the ampliﬁer
A(ω) and that of the feedback-loop F (ω), where ω is the frequency of the signal [see
Fig.1(b)]. As one can readily see, the circuit is assumed to be capable of producing a self-
sustained sine-wave signal if there is a frequency, ω0, for which A(ω0)F (ω0) ≥1. This is
called the Barkhausen condition after the German scientist Heinrich Georg Barkhausen
(1881-1956). Since A(ω) and F (ω) may be complex numbers, the Barkhausen condition
actually implies the following two equations

ℜ[A(ω0)F (ω0)] ≥ 1

and

ℑ[A(ω0)F (ω0)] = 0 ,

(1)

where ℜ(X) and ℑ(X) denote the real and imaginary part of X, respectively.

For most ampliﬁer stages, however, A(ω) has no imaginary part. As a matter of
fact, A(ω) ≈ A where A may be assumed to be a real, negative or positive constant
for an inverter or a non-inverter ampliﬁer, respectively. Eqs.(1), therefore, reduce to
ℑ[F (ω0)] = 0 and Aℜ[F (ω0)] ≥ 1. The equations above enable the calculation of the
frequency of oscillation (ω0) and the minimum |A| of the ampliﬁer required to sustain
the oscillation, i.e. |A|min = 1/|ℜ[F (ω0)]|.

It must be mentioned though, that ℑ[F (ω)] can be forced to have a zero at a
predetermined frequency, thanks to the fact that the feedback-loop contains a circuit
known as the frequency-determining network (FDN). A FDN can be realized using a
combination of resistors and capacitors as in the family of RC-oscillators or, inductors
and capacitors as in the so-called LC-oscillators. Depending on the particular FDN the
oscillator is often named after the person who designed it.

Curiously enough, one can apply the analysis above to RC-oscillators, and both
the oscillation frequency ω0 and |A|min are readily obtained. But when it comes to
LC-oscillators some diﬃculties appear. This shortcoming is normally circumvented
thanks to the fact that single-stages, either BJT or JFET ampliﬁers, are not voltage
but transconductance ampliﬁers. Therefore, the analysis of such ampliﬁers has to be
carried out in a diﬀerent manner and, in the end, it all seems to work fairly well [1].
However, in some text-books such a diﬃculty appear to be overlooked when a voltage
operational-ampliﬁer is proposed as an example of LC-oscillators [3, 4]. This is deﬁnitely
not correct and, although such an oscillator may work, in the sense that it may oscillate,
it will not produce a sinusoidal signal and naturally, the oscillation frequency may not
be necessarily the one predicted by the analysis above.

In order to see this in more detail, one can study the LC-oscillator named after
Colpitts that appears in Figure 2 [3, 4]. For such a circuit the following results can be
readily obtained,

A = −

RF
R1

and

F (ω) =

R1
R1(1 − ω2C1L) + jωL

,

(2)

where j is the imaginary unit.

As one can see, the Barkhausen criteria, i.e. A(ω)F (ω) ≥1, cannot be accomplished
for any real, diﬀerent-from-zero value of ω. However, as was previously mentioned, there
is nothing unexpected in these results since the FDN used in these circuits does not work
with a voltage ampliﬁer.

There is though a simple way of solving this problem. This can be done by
introducing a resistors (R2) connected in series with the FDN as indicated in Fig.3.
By doing so, A remains unchanged but F reads

F (ω) =

R1
[R1(1 − ω2LC1) + jωL](1 + jωR2C2) + R2(1 + jωR1C1)

.

Thus, from ℑ[F ](ω0) = 0 one obtains the oscillation frequency

and, since A = −RF /R1 one thus has

RF C1C2R1R2

R1R2(R1C 2

2 ) + L(R2C1 + R1C2)

≥ 1 .

In the case R1 = R2 = R and C1 = C2 = C, Eqs. (4-5) reduce to

and

It worth noticing that the results above diﬀer from those obtained for a
transconductance ampliﬁer. The diﬀerence, however, is negligible small provided that
CR2 ≫ L. In fact, if L/(CR2) ≪1, then, one has

ω2

and

RF ≥ 2R .

which are the results that normally appear in text-books for a Colpitts oscillator
equipped with a transconductance ampliﬁer.

In order to verify the results above, a sine-wave oscillator like that in Fig.3 was
mounted. A uA741 was used as voltage operational-ampliﬁer and, R=1kΩ, C=100 nF,

L=3.9 mH and RF =2.4 kΩ. The oscillator was observed to oscillate at a frequency that
was fairly close to the value predicted by Eq.(4) and the amplitude of the oscillation
was of the order of 1V (pp). Furthermore, the oscillation frequency was observed to be
fairly insensitive to the power voltage from as low as ±5 up to ±15V.

For large R-values however, deviations from Eq.(5) was observed.

In fact, with
increasing R a RF larger than that predicted by Eq.(5) appears to be required. This
is found to be connected to the fact that for large R the inductor resistance cannot be
disregarded. This can be readily investigated by including the inductor resistance RL
as indicated in Fig.4 thus, after some algebra, one obtains

It must be observed that, in the limiting case R ≫ RL, L/(CR2) ≪1, and CRRL ≪ L,
these equations reduce to those in (7). However, in the case that only the ﬁrst two
inequalities hold, then, in lieu of Eq.(9) one must use RF ≥ 2R(1 + CRRL/L). For a
RL=8Ω inductor, as the one utilized in the present circuit, one has RF ≥ 2R(1+R/5kΩ).
An equation that is observed to account for the present experiment fairly well.

PSPICE simulations of the circuit above have also been performed. To this end, the
operational ampliﬁer is replaced by a voltage-controlled source E1 (see ﬁgure 5) with an
input resistance Rin = 1MΩ and the same open-loop gain as that of the µA741 at the
frequency of the oscillation. Similarly, an initial 0.01 V voltage is applied to capacitor
C2 since oscillations will not start up unless the circuit is somehow perturbed. The
results of simulations show that the circuit delivers a neat, sinusoidal output voltage. A

stable oscillation amplitude, however, is only attained after adjusting RF to 2.58 kΩ, a
value that compares fairly well with the minimum RF predicted by Eq.(9).

In summary,

it is found that LC-oscillators driven by a voltage operational-
ampliﬁer, as those that often appear in text-books of elementary electronics, may not
necessarily work as expected. According to the present study, such a diﬃculty stems
from the fact that the frequency-determining network (FDN) used in these circuits are
designed for transconductance, not for voltage ampliﬁers. Curiously enough however,
there is no warning about this point in such text-books and teachers may found it quite
annoying at observing that, even though nothing seems to be wrong, the oscillator does
not work as assumed. As is shown in this paper however, there seems to be a simple
way of solving this problem. It consists in connecting a resistor in series with the FDN.
By doing so, these LC-oscillators are observed to work as is expected from the block
diagram in Fig.1 and the Barkhausen criteria in Eqs.(1). It must be also mentioned
that the so-called Hartley oscillator exhibited the same kind of problem. Again, such a
diﬃculty can be readily solved by adding a resistor in series with the FDN as discussed
above.

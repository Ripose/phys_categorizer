Air resistance1

Many problems in your book ask you to ignore air resistance; several even say
that you “can” ignore air resistance. Is it true? Certainly if we say that you
may ignore air resistance, then you may. However, the question remains: When
is it physically correct to ignore air resistance?

The detailed analysis of the interaction of air with moving solid bodies is
extremely complex, involving not just pressure but also wakes, drafts, turbu-
lence, and, at very high speeds, shocks. However, it is possible to get reasonable
order-of-magnitude estimates of air resistance simply from dimensional analysis.
Dimensional analysis is a method for obtaining approximate answers to
physics problems by consideration only (or primarily) of the dimensions or units
of the quantities involved. As an example consider this problem:

Problem 1 A heavy object is dropped from a height h. How long does it take
to hit the ground? Ignore air resistance.

We know (from Galileo’s experiments) that all things not strongly aﬀected
by air resistance fall with the same acceleration due to gravity g, independent
of mass or composition. So our answer will depend only on the height h and
this acceleration g. The units of acceleration g are m s−2 (meters per second
per second) and the units of the height h is m (meters). How do we make a
quantity with units of time; in this case s (seconds)?

The acceleration g contains a s−2 but also a pesky m (meters). We have to
divide out that length with the height h. If you play around, you will ﬁnd that
the only way to make a time t with an acceleration g and height h is

h/g. Indeed,

Though the answer is wrong in detail, it has many correct features. For
one, it gives you the correct form for the answer (something times
h/g). For
another, it tells you (as you might expect) that higher heights mean longer
free-fall times. Going further, the dimensional analysis even tells you that the
square of the time is proportional to the height; that’s a pretty detailed result
given that we did almost no thinking to achieve it!

The great thing about physics is that the dimensionless prefactor is rarely
far, far larger or far, far smaller than 1. Sometimes it is π. Sometimes it is π2
(yes, that’s close to 10), but rarely is it 100 or 0.01.

Let’s apply this thinking to air resistance.

Problem 2 A soccer ball is kicked hard at 20 m s−1. Which has a larger
magnitude, the gravitational force on the ball or the air resistance force on the
ball?

We are only goint to try to get an approximate answer to this problem, by
dimensional analysis. The magnitude of the gravitational force Fg is just m g
(yes, this is the only combination that has units of kg m s−2 (Newtons). If we
10 m s−2 and look up on the web that soccer balls have masses
recall that g

How do we estimate the air resistance force?

Air resistance comes, primarily, because there is air in the way of the ball,
and the ball must push the air out of the way. In detail this depends on many
things, but the dominant dependence is on the speed v of the ball (because it
aﬀects how quickly the air must be moved out of the way), the cross-sectional
area A of the ball (because it aﬀects how much air must be moved out of the
way), and the density ρ (“rho”) of the air (because it aﬀects how much mass
is associated with that much air). The speed v has units of m s−1 (meters per
second), the cross-sectional area A has units of m2 (square meters), and the
density ρ has units of kg m−3 (kilograms per cubic meter). How do we combine
these variables to make a quantity with units of force or kg m s−2? Again there
is only one dimensionally correct result:

The magnitude of the air resistance force Fair is very well described by

Fair = ξ ρ A v2

,

(4)

where ξ (“xi”) is a dimensionless prefactor (like that discussed above). This
result is the only one possible, given the units of the quantities at hand! Check-
ing:

on the web that soccer balls are about 0.25 m in diameter (or about 0.05 m2 in

cross-sectional area), and estimate the density of air from what we remember
from high-school chemistry (1 mol of N2 weighs about 28 g and ﬁlls about 22 ℓ,
so it is a little more dense than 1 kg m−3), we ﬁnd

Fair = ξ ρ A v2

The force on the soccer ball from the air is comparable to the force of gravity!
Would it be physically correct to ignore air resistance in this case? No, not at
all.

Problem 3 What’s the terminal velocity vterm for a soccer ball dropped from
a tall building?

If you drop a soccer ball from a tall building, it will accelerate due to gravity
to larger and larger speeds v. Eventually it will approach the speed at which the
air resistance force (which opposes velocity) balances gravity. Because we don’t
know the value of the dimensionless prefactor ξ, we can’t answer this question
precisely, but approximately:

where we have plugged in numbers from above.

Interestingly, the expression for the terminal velocity can be used to predict
that objects of the same size and shape will have terminal velocities that vary as
the square root of their masses. This prediction can be conﬁrmed by comparing
the free-fall time of a basket-shaped coﬀee ﬁlter with that of four stacked basket-
shaped coﬀee ﬁlters (with, therefore, four times the mass of one).

Here are problems to try on your own:

Problem 4 A normal stone brick is dropped from a height of one meter.
Which has the greater magnitude, the gravitational force or the air-resistance
force?

Answer this question by assuming that air resistance doesn’t matter, and
then check the relative magnitudes when the brick is moving its fastest. You
will ﬁnd that in this situation ignoring air resistance is physically correct.

That is, there are situations in which air resistance can be safely ignored.
The point is that the importance of air resistance is not a matter of deﬁnition
or convention: it is a physical property of the situation that can be checked.

Problem 5 A good soccer player can kick a soccer ball on an arc that subtends
a horizontal distance of 70 m (remember the World Cup?). Use dimensional
analysis to estimate the magnitude of the initial velocity v that the player must
apply to the ball, ignoring air resistance. Now estimate whether ignoring air
resistance was physically correct. Does a real player have to kick the ball faster
or slower than this speed to make it go 70 m?

Problem 6 Same as the previous problem, but for a golf ball hit 300 m.

Problem 7 What is the terminal velocity of a US penny dropped from a tall
building? How does your answer depend on whether it falls face-on or edge-on?

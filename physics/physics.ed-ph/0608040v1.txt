Abstract

In the Special Theory of Relativity space and time intervals are diﬀerent in diﬀerent frames of

reference. As a consequence, the quantity ”velocity” of classical mechanics splits into diﬀerent

quantities in Special Relativity, coordinate velocity, proper velocity and rapidity. The introduction

and clear distinction of these quantities provides a basis to introduce the kinematics of uniform

and accelerated motion in an elementary and intuitive way. Furthermore, rapidity links kinematics

to dynamics and provides a rigorous way to derive Newtons Second Law in the relativistic version.

Although the covariant tensorial notation of relativity is a powerful tool for dealing with relativis-

tic problems, its mathematical diﬃculties may obscure the physical background of relativity for

undergraduate students. Proper velocity and proper acceleration are the spatial components of

the relativistic velocity and acceleration vectors, and thus, they provide a possibility to introduce

and justify the vectorial notation of spacetime. The use of the three diﬀerent quantities describ-

ing ”velocity” is applied to discuss the problems arising in a thought experiment of a relativistic

spaceﬂight.

INTRODUCTION

The teaching of Special Relativity is often confronted with mathematical or conceptual

diﬃculties. A clear mathematical formulation using tensors is generally considered to be too

diﬃcult for undergraduate level. The use of simpler mathematics together with the verbal

description of the counter-intuitive physics underlying Relativity also poses a great challenge

for teachers and students. Verbal explanations trying to use pictures of classical physics in

Special Relativity are at best confusing to the students. Several so called paradoxa arise

from attempts to explain relativistic phenomena using a terminology coming from classical

physics.

Sometimes, one single quantity in a theory splits into several distinct quantities in the

generalised theory. One example is the velocity in classical mechanics. In the widest sense,

velocity or speed means the covered distance divided by the time needed to cover it. This is

uncritical in classical physics, where time and distance are well deﬁned operational concepts

that are independent of the frame of reference, in which they are measured.

In Special

Relativity, these concepts depend on the frame of reference in which they are deﬁned, if the

frames are not at rest with respect to each other. This makes it necessary to distinguish

between the diﬀerent possibilities regarding the frame of reference in which the spatial and

the temporal intervals are measured. This is best illustrated with a common situation of

measuring the velocity of a rolling car. Firstly, the velocity of the car can be measured

by driving past kilometer posts and reading the time at the moment of passing the post

on synchronized watches mounted on the posts. Secondly, the driver can also measure the

velocity by reading the corresponding times on a clock which is travelling with the car.

Thirdly, a person with clock standing beside the street can measure the times on his clock

at the moments, when the front and the rear ends of the car are passing him. The travelled

distance is then taken from a measurement of the length of the car in the frame of reference of

the car. A fourth possibility measures the velocity of the car up to an arbitrary constant by

measuring its acceleration using an accelerometer travelling with the car, e.g. by measuring

a force and using Newtons Second Law, and integrates the measured acceleration over the

time measured with a clock, also travelling with the car.

In classical mechanics, all four measurements are equivalent and give the same value for

the velocity. In Special Relativity, the ﬁrst possiblility gives the coordinate velocity, which

2

is often referred to as the genuine velocity. The second and third possibilities are equivalent,

but are hybrid deﬁnitions of the speed. The temporal and spatial intervals are measured

in diﬀerent frames of reference. This speed is sometimes called celerity [1, 2], or proper

velocity [3, 4]. In addition, proper velocity is the spatial part of the vector of four-velocity

[5]. The fourth deﬁnition of a speed, sometimes called rapidity [1, 2], is somewhat distinct

from the other concepts of speed in so far as it can only be determined as a change of

speed. The need to measure an acceleration in the moving frame by means of measuring a

force qualiﬁes rapidity to bridge kinematics and dynamics. This seems to be not critical in

classical mechanics, if the concept of force is accepted as an operational quantity. However,

it can also be used to determine the relativistic version of Newtons Second Law if viewed

from the accelerated frame of reference.

In this paper, a way to introduce the kinematics and dynamics of Special Relativity is

proposed by deﬁning and consistently using the diﬀerent concepts of speeds. This method

requires the knowledge of the Lorentz transformation and the concept of spacetime. The

kinematics of the uniform movement but also the kinematics and dynamics of accelerated

motion can be rigorously introduced in a simple and intuitive way. The results are applied

to an intergalactic spaceﬂight with constant acceleration, and the problems arising from

relativistic eﬀects encounterd during such a spaceﬂight are discussed both qualitatively and

quantitatively.

In the following, we use the dimensionless speeds, β = v/c for coordinate velocity,

ω = w/c for the proper velocity and ρ = r/c for the rapidity, where v, w and r are the

corresponding speeds measured e.g in a metric system of units for time and distance, and c

is the velocity of light in vacuum. Correspondingly, the acceleration is scaled with the speed

of light, α = a/c. Note that α has the dimension of a rate. Mass m is always considered to

be the invariant rest mass. Furthermore, we restrict our considerations to the 2-dimensional

case of spacetime with one temporal coordinate ct and one spatial coordinate x. This is the

simplest, non-trivial case, in which the essence of many phenomena of Special Relativity can

be learned.

THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION

The hypotheses that underly the Special Theory of Relativity exclusively concern space

and time [6, 7, 8]. The principle of relativity states that all inertial frames of reference are

equivalent and no absolute frame can be singled out. From these principles an invariant

velocity follows, which is in fact the speed of light. It serves as an absolute scale and couples

space and time. This is best seen in the Lorentz transformations that map the coordinates

(ct1, x1) in one inertial frame of reference onto the coordinates (ct2, x2) in another inertial

frame,

where γ = 1/√1

β2 is often called relativistic factor. Composition of the transformations

−

of three collinearly moving frames yields the known theorem of the addition of velocities,

β12 = (β1 + β2)/(1 + β1β2), from which for β1 < 1 and β2 < 1 results β12 < 1. The general

form of a transformation corresponding to Eq. (1) is

The general parameter φ for the movement is deﬁned by the choice of the functions, and

can be expressed with the coordinate velocity,

β = g(φ)/f (φ).

However, in most cases, no simple interpretation of φ is possible. An example is given by

f (σ) = (σ2

1)/2σ and g(σ) = (σ2 + 1)/2σ, where the relation of σ with the coordinate

velocity is β = (σ2

1)/(σ2 + 1). Composition of transformations yields that σ is multi-

From Eqs. (1) and (4) follows β = tanh(ρ). Composition of transformations yields the addi-

tivity of the parameter, ρ12 = ρ1 + ρ2, and thus the relation ρ = ln(σ) to the multiplicative

parameter σ. The additivity of ρ was already mentioned by [9].

KINEMATICS

Speeds

Motion is generally described with a velocity, i.e. the diﬀerential limit

β = lim
∆t→0

∆x
c ∆t

,

where ∆x is a change in position within the time step ∆t, and c is the speed of light.

In Galilean spacetime, ∆t and ∆x are the same in all frames of reference. In relativistic

spacetime this is not the case and a careful distinction of diﬀerent operational deﬁnitions

of speed has to be made. It is important to distinguish whether the two quantities ∆x and

∆t are measured in the same inertial frame or not. As mentioned above, the latter case is

e.g. applied by car drivers for the calibration of the tachometer. For the proper velocity the

time step ∆τ is measured on the clock travelling with the car and the change in position

(kilometer posts) ∆x is measured in the rest frame of the street,

The reciprocal measurement yields the same result: an observer outside the car measures

the time ∆t on her clock between the passages of the front and rear ends of the car, however,

using the proper length ∆l of the car as speciﬁed by the manufacturer,

Since ∆t = γ ∆τ and ∆l = γ∆x, the proper velocity is related to the coordinate velocity by

ω = γβ, and γ = √1 + ω2. The proper velocity ω is an unbound quantity.

Another possibility to quantify motion is using quantities measured in the accelerated

vehicle alone. The rapidity of a spacecraft is deﬁned as the integral of the correspondingly

recorded acceleration α with respect to proper time τ [1, 2],

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

where the rapidity ρ is deﬁned up to an integration constant ρ0. This measurement is not

critical in classical physics. In relativistic physics, the observability of this acceleration is

not obvious and needs further analysis.

Acceleration

In classical physics, acceleration is deﬁned by

α = lim
∆t→0

∆v
c ∆t

,

In relativistic physics, several possibilities exist whether for ∆v/c the coordinate velocity

∆β, the proper velocity ∆ω or the rapidity ∆ρ, and whether the coordinate time ∆t or the

proper time ∆τ is chosen.

To introduce diﬀerent deﬁnitions of acceleration, a spacecraft is considered, that changes

its velocity in a given time interval. Two inertial frames of reference, I1 and I2, are deﬁned, co-

moving with the spacecraft at the beginning and at the end of the time interval, respectively.

The coordinate velocities of I1 and I2 with respect to a chosen inertial frame of reference are

β1 and β2, and the corresponding velocity increment is ∆β = β2

β1. The relative velocity

∆β12 between I1 and I2 is given by the Einsteinian velocity combination law,

In the diﬀerential limit for vanishing length of the time interval,

The acceleration α deﬁned by the velocity increment ∆β12 and the proper time interval ∆τ

are proper quantities determined in the frame of the spacecraft alone [2],

the rapidity ρ is deﬁned up to an integration constant ρ0. Similar to proper velocity, rapidity

is an unbound quantity. Comparing Eq. (13) with Eqs. (3) and (4), with an appropriate

choice of the frame of reference, such that ρ0 = 0 we ﬁnd

γ = cosh(ρ)

and ω = γβ = sinh(ρ).

where dβ/dt is the coordinate acceleration. This is an interesting and useful result. The

acceleration α is not only the derivative of rapidity ρ with respect to the proper time τ ,

but is equal to the derivative of the proper velocity ω with respect to coordinate time t in

an inertial reference frame. This corresponds to the deﬁnition of proper acceleration, which

corresponds to the spatial part of the relativistic acceleration vector.

Equation (15) suggests to deﬁne the uniform accleration as uniform proper acceleration,

dω/dt = const, rather than a constant coordinate acceleration, dβ/dt. If the velocity of the

spacecraft is β0 = ω0 = ρ0 = 0 at time t0 = τ0 = 0, the rapidity after uniform acceleration

α at proper time τ is ρ = ατ , and with Eq. (6), the distance travelled in an inertial frame

Equations (16) and (18) constitute a parameter equation for the world line of an uniformly

which is the equation of a hyperbola in a Minkowski diagram. The asymptotes of the hyper-

bola have inclinations

RELATIVISTIC DYNAMICS

The spacetime of Einsteinian Relativity makes a revision of Newtonian mechanics neces-

sary. Newtons Second Law involves more than one frame of reference and this turns out to

have consequences on the dynamics. Newtons Second Law F = d(m v)/dt, where F is the

force acting during the time increment dt on the mass m that moves with the velocity v is

F =

d(γm v)
dt

.

(20)

In relativistic spacetime it has to be speciﬁed that the time increment dt is measured in the

frame of reference in which the mass is moving with velocity v. Equation. (20) is the correct

equation and has the property that all physical quantities are deﬁned in the same frame of

rewritten as

reference.

In this paper a derivation of relativistic dynamics is suggested in which Newtons Second

Law is written in quantities described in the rest frame of the accelerated mass. These

quantities are the invariant mass, the proper time and the rapidity. For simplicity, the

derivation is restricted to linear motion and collinear acceleration.

Rapidity needs a concept of inertia for the measurement of proper acceleration, such that

an accelerometer measures acceleration independent of the actual speed with respect to any

inertial frame of reference. If this were not the case, then one speciﬁc inertial frame could be

singled out to serve as an absolute frame of reference, and the principle of relativity would

be violated. A measurement of a weight in a laboratory or in a spacecraft ﬂying in space is a

static measurement with respect to the spacecraft, and Newtons Second Law applies exactly.

8

An astronaut feeling a constant weight thus correctly interpretes the motion as uniformly

accelerated. With a gyroscope, it is possible to distinguish between a linearly accelerated or

purely circular motion, or any combination of both.

In the simplest case of linear acceleration, the astronaut interpretes the proper accelera-

tion as a change of the rapidity per proper time interval. Furthermore, the constant weight

of the astronaut is correctly interpreted as the constant force needed to accelerate the in-

variant rest mass with the constant proper acceleration, independent of the rapidity with

respect to any desired frame of reference. In the case of non-uniform linear acceleration,

the momentary weight F can be interpreted as the constant force needed to accelerate the

mass m of the astronaut with the momentary proper acceleration α, again independent of

the momentary rapidity,

(21)

which is the relativistic ”Second Law”, Eq.

(20), written in terms of velocity and time

as measured in an inertial frame of reference moving with velocity v = c β relative to the

astronaut with mass m. This makes it particularly transparent that the factor γ3 in the

relativistic relation between force and the acceleration stems from the transformation of

space and time, and has no physical relation to the mass.

Using the proper quantities, the notation of classical kinematics can be recovered for

relativistic kinematics, Eqs. (7) and (15), such that the proper velocity is the derivative of

proper length with respect to coordinate time and proper acceleration is the derivative of

proper velocity with respect to coordinate time. This pattern can be extended to dynamics

be deﬁning force F as the derivative of linear momentum p with respect to coordinate time.

From Eq. (21) we get

and consequently, the linear momentum is p = m c ω. The kinetic energy of a relativistic

particle is best derived by computing the work applied to the particle to accelerate it to a

velocity β [11],

where the particle travels a distance d in the system where Ekin is measured. Applying the

SPACE TRAVEL

To reach interstellar distances within a reasonable time, high velocities, and thus, contin-

uous acceleration during travel time are required. A ﬂight to a star must include two stages:

acceleration to high velocities and breaking down the velocity to the velocity of the star. At a

constant proper acceleration of 9.8 m/s2, corresponding to about 1 Lightyear/year2, a ﬂight

to α-Centauri in 4.3 Lightyears distance will last about 3.63 proper years. In the middle of

the trip, the rapidity of the spacecraft would be ρ = 1.4, the proper velocity ω = 1.9 and

the coordinate velocity relative to Earth β = 0.88. A ﬂight to α-Centauri and back to Earth

would last at least 7.26 proper years, whereas on Earth 14.5 years would pass between take

oﬀ and return of the spacecraft. The corresponding times to travel to the Andromada Galaxy

and back is 58 proper years, and the corresponding speeds in the middle between Earth and
10−13.

the Andromada Galaxy are ρ = 14.5, ω = 991380 and β = 0.9999999999995 = 1

5

−

·

On Earth, about 8 Million years elapsed during the corresponding trip to the Andromeda

galaxy in a distance of 2 Million Lightyears from Earth, and back. At this constant proper

acceleration, the covered distances become large at a large rate. In 20 proper years, the

astronaut covers a distance of 250 Million Lightyears, 36 Billion Lightyears after 25 proper

years. It is in principle possible to travel to the most distant galaxies within a human life

time, as is outlined quite realistically in the science ﬁction novel ”Tau Zero” by [12], if such

a spacecraft would be available.

However, the realization of this cosmic travel plan requires the solution of some serious

problems, of which most are based on relativistic eﬀects. The ﬁrst problem concerns the

necessary speciﬁcation for the spacecraft that is able to accelerate over a long time in outer

space. There are two diﬀerent possibilities: the ﬁrst is a rocket that carries all necessary fuel

and energy from the beginning, and the second is the ramjet [13, 14] that collects interstellar

matter that can be used for fuel and energy supply.

10

Many problems are caused by the existing radiation in space and the interstellar or inter-

galactic matter. Although the spacecraft travels through almost empty space, problems are

caused by the extreme Doppler shift of the electromagnetic radiation at the high relativistic

speeds, and even more, by the existing matter mostly in the form of hydrogen and helium

atoms and dust particles.

Interstellar matter

The density of interstellar matter is estimated to be about one hydrogen atom per cubic

centimeter within galaxies. Between the galaxies, it is about 6 orders of magnitude smaller

with about 1 hydrogen atom per cubic meter. Within dense nebulae, particles made of ice
and carbon of 10−18 kg may occur [15], however, they contribute only to about half a percent

of the total mass.

We assume that the spacecraft does not deﬂect the interstellar matter by using e.g. a

magnetic ﬁeld.
In this case, the particles and atoms are stopped and collected by the
ship. To calculate the particle ﬂux ˙N , the proper velocity ω is the adequate quantity. The

number of collected particles depends on the volume dV of space covered by the spacecraft

as measured in the reference frame of Earth, however, seen from the spacecraft, the ﬂux

must be measured in units of proper time dτ . The volume dV covered in a proper time

interval dτ by a spacecraft with a cross sectional area A at a proper velocity ω is

and the corresponding particle ﬂux

where n is the density of particles. With the assumption that the majority of particles are
10−27 kg, and with a particle density in
hydrogen atoms with a rest mass of µ0 = 1.7
intergalactic space of nintergalactic = 1 m−3, the particle ﬂux on the spacecraft at a velocity of
10−13 kg s−1m−2.
ω = 106 becomes ˙N = 3

1014 s−1m−2, and the corresponding mass ﬂux is 5

corresponding to 150 Pa for the above situation. The kinetic energy that each particle

deposits in the ship is

For a proton this corresponds to about 1 TeV at ω = 106. This energy can be reached in

todays most powerful accelerators, such as Tevatron at Fermilab. The corresponding energy
1010 Wm−2, corresponding to a black body radiation

ﬂux at the front of the ship is then 4.5

·
with a temperature of nearly 30’000 K.

Equation (29) also indicates a problem of the Bussard-ramjet. The kinetic energy of the

collected particles eventually exceeds their rest energy,

Ekin = µ0c2(γ

1) > µ0c2.

−

Therefore, even if all of the rest energy of collected particles could be applied to accelerate

the jet to propulse the spacecraft, its speed could never exceed γ = 2. Realistically, a nuclear

fusion reactor gains about 1 per mille of the rest energy. This limits the speed of such a

ramjet to about 3% of the speed of light. A Bussard-ramjet could only operate at higher

velocities if all the collected particles are funneled through the engines without stopping

them. They would then have to be accelerated by using an energy source that has to be

carried with the ship from the beginning of the journey.

Electromagnetic radiation

The spacecraft ﬂies through a ﬁeld of electromagnetic radiation. The sources of this

radiation are the stars and the cosmic microwave background, and its spectrum ranges from

radio waves to gamma rays and beyond. The energy of the cosmic microwave background

dominates the background radiation in deep space far away from stars [16]. At relativistic

speeds the radiation ﬁeld is strongly changed due to Doppler shift and aberration [8, 17].

The astronaut registers a radiation ﬁeld of high intensity and shifted to high frequencies

12

around the apex, i.e. in the direction of the journey, and very little radiation from the rest

of the celestial sphere.

The Doppler shift in the direction of the apex is f ′ = f (γ + ω), where f and f ′ are

the frequencies of the radiation in the rest frame of the radiation source and seen from the

spacecraft, respectively. At ω

γ = 106, as in the middle of the trip to the Andromada

≈

galaxy, the cosmic background radiation of a wavelength of 1 mm is shifted to soft X-
rays with a wavelength of 5 ˚Angstr¨om. The pressure of this radiation on the front of the
10−8 Pa [18], which is negligibly small compared with the pressure exerted

spacecraft is 7

·

by the intergalactic matter. However, When heading towards a star, the Doppler shifted

stellar radiation would become extremely hard and living organisms must be shielded from

this radiation.

DISCUSSION

The consequent distiction and application of the three types of speeds in teaching Spe-

cial Relativity allows us to explain the relativistic kinematics and dynamics in an intuitive

way. The description of motion, acceleration and linear momentum can be recovered in the

classical way by replacing the coordinate velocity with the proper velocity. This fact is not

novel since in the vectorial notation, the spatial parts of velocity and acceleration vectors

correspond to proper velocity and proper acceleration. However, this is often obscured by

taking the relativistic factor γ out of the vector components, thus writing the vectors as the

relativistic factor times a vector with the components of the coordinate velocity.

We used the facts that e.g. an astronaut in a spacecraft could not perceive a uniform

motion of his spacecraft without looking out of a window, and he would perceive a constant

proper acceleration by feeling his own constant weight independent, however, of his velocity

relative to any external frame of reference. These situations can be mapped to everyday

experiences in traveling with trains or airplanes, and thus, can be based on the classical

concepts of motion and inertia. The application of the relativistic kinematics and dynam-

ics to steady accelerated spaceﬂight may make the topic more appealing to students than

misleading paradoxa and diﬃcult concepts such as length contraction and time dilatation.

The restriction to the two-dimensional spacetime, one temporal and one spatial coor-

dinate, limits the application of this method to collinear motion, acceleration and forces.

13

On the other hand, the results oﬀer the basis for the vectorial notation in two dimensions,

which then can readily be extended to the 1+3 dimensional general case. The topic may

then be extendend to what the astronaut really observes if he looks out of the window of

his spacecraft, not length contraction, but aberration and Doppler shift of electromagnetic

waves, and it only makes sense to compare the diﬀerent times that passed in the spacecraft

and on Earth when he returns to Earth.

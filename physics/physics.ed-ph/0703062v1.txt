Abstract. We present a short overview on the ideas of large extra-dimensions and
their implications for the possible production of micro black holes in the next generation
particle accelerator at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) from this year on. In fact, the
possibility of black hole production on earth is currently one of the most exciting
predictions for the LHC accelerator and would change our current understanding of
physics radically. While it is impossible to discuss the models and implications in full
detail here, this article is thought to serve as a starting point for the interested physics
students with some basic knowledge about general relativity and particle physics.

How to Create Black Holes on Earth?

1. Introduction

Ninety years ago, Karl Schwarzschild, was the ﬁrst one to present a solution to Einstein’s
famous equations for general relativity [1]. His result layed the foundation for the study
of some of the most fascinating and mysterious objects known today, black holes. Usually
one ﬁnds these gigantic objects in the centers of galaxies like our Milky Way. The central
black hole in our Milky Way is in the constellation Sagittarius (see Ref. [3] for actual
pictures of the black hole from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory), has a mass of 3 Million
Suns and gravitationally binds our galaxy together. Nowadays, it is believed that this
huge black hole was created from a tiny density ﬂuctuation shortly after the Big Bang
[4].

Even without detailed knowledge of the theory of general relativity, Schwarzschild’s

solution can be easily obtained from Einstein’s ﬁeld equations:

where m2
p = 1/G is the inverse of the Newtonian constant and mp denotes the Planck
mass. The sources of gravity are everything which carries energy and/or momentum.
These quantities are described in the energy momentum tensor Tµν on the right hand
side. The sources cause a curvature of space-time which is described by the metric gµν,
and the curvature tensor R. For a detailed discussion of the Einstein-equations, we refer
to Ref. [2]. For a spherically symmetric mass distribution the metric outside of the mass
distribution is then described by the Schwarzschild solution [1, 2]:

ds2 = gµνdxµdxν =

γ(r)dt2 + γ(r)−1dr2 + r2dΩ2

,

where

and dΩ is the surface element of the 3-dimensional unit sphere and M is the total mass
of the object.

Here one observes that black holes are an immediate consequence of the
Schwarzschild solution Eq.(2). The metric component gtt = γ(r) vanishes at the radius
RH = 2M/m2
p, the so called Schwarzschild radius. However, for usual objects like our
sun, this radius is
2 Km and therefore well inside the mass distributions where the
exterior solution can not be applied. Thus, only if the mass is so densely packed that
it has a radius smaller than RH, we will have to consider the consequences of gtt →
0.
This is the case of black hole formation.

≈

Astrophysically, the existence of giant black holes is well established - from
Schwarzschilds pioneering works to the calculations of Stephen Hawking, many
theoretical and experimental features ﬁt well together.

Just recently, however, new theoretical ideas came up that might completely change
our thinking about black holes, namely the prediction of “micro black holes” [5, 6].
These new approaches for the formation and investigation of black holes are based on

How to Create Black Holes on Earth?

theoretical models about the microscopic geometry of the universe broad up over the
last couple of years.

In the following sections I will try to summarize some of the key ingredients and
ﬁndings within these new scenarios. The level of presentation is such that a student
with basic knowledge on general relativity and particle physics should be easily able to
follow the line of arguments. The interested reader is referred to the following review
articles for further exploration of (micro) black hole physics and large extra dimensions
[7, 8, 9].

2. Extra-dimensions and extremely strong gravity

The new idea is that our universe might have more than the well known three spatial
dimension, height, width and length, but up to seven additional space dimensions that
are usually unobservable. These additional dimensions are curled up to tiny “doughnuts”
to make them hard to observe with a probe that is bigger than the extension of
the “doughnut” - i.e. the extra dimensions are compactiﬁed on a torus of radius R.
Surprisingly, in some models these additional dimensions can be as big a R
1/100
millimetre, therefore they are called “large extra dimensions”. These ideas were ﬁrst
put forward by the physicists N. Arkani-Hamed, G. Dvali, S. Dimopoulos, I. Antoniadis
and L. Randall, R. Sundrum in 1998/1999 [10, 11, 12].

∼

What makes these models especially interesting is the fact that the gravitational
interaction increases strongly (by factors on the order of 1032) on distances below the
extension of the extra dimensions. The strict way to show this is to start from the
Einstein-Hilbert action for d-dimensional gravity and to integrate out the additional
space like extra dimensions. However, there is an easier way to understand this.

Consider a particle of mass M located in a space time with d + 3 dimensions. The
general solution of Poisson’s equation yields its potential as a function of the radial
distance r from the source

φ(r) =

1
M d+2
f

.

≫

Here we have introduced a new fundamental mass-scale Mf with a suitable exponent.
Remembering that the additional d space-time dimensions are compactiﬁed on radii R,
then, at distances r
R, the extra dimensions should be ’hidden’ and the potential Eq.
(4) should turn into the well known 1/r potential, however with a pre-factor including
the volume of the extra dimensions

In the limit of large distances, this should be identical to Newton’s gravitational law,
yielding the relation

Assuming that Mf has the right order of magnitude to be compatible with observed
it can be seen that the volume of the extra dimensions suppresses the
physics,

fundamental scale and thus, explains the huge value of the Planck mass. Today one
expects this new fundamental scale to be of the order of Mf ∼
1 TeV, allowing sizes of
extra dimensions between 1/10 mm to 1/1000 fm for d from 2 to 7.

The above arguments can be followed even clearer when one remembers that the
strength of interaction is proportional to the density of ﬂux lines. Fig. 1 illustrates
this behaviour: While the top ﬁgure shows the setting with a mass point in the
center for one dimension with undiluted ﬂux lines, the lower ﬁgure shows (in the
magnifying glass) that there are actually two dimensions and the ﬁeld lines are
diluted. Mathematically speaking we ﬁnd that in the usual three dimensional world
the gravitational potential falls-oﬀ like 1/distance, however if we have more dimension
(e.g. d additional dimensions) to dilute the gravitational ﬂux lines, the potential will
fall like 1/distanced+1.

Why is the gravitational ﬁeld then stronger at small distances? This becomes
clear, if we remember that the long distance behaviour of gravitation is ﬁxed from daily
observation (Newton’s law). If we extrapolate towards smaller distances the additional
dilution of the ﬁeld lines starts, therefore, to get the proper long distance behaviour back,
one has to start with more dense ﬂux lines (meaning stronger gravitational interaction)
at small distances.

Thus,

if Newton’s law is modiﬁed at small distances if extra dimensions are
introduced, the most obvious experimental test for the existence of extra dimensions is a
measurement of the Newtonian potential at small distances. Cavendish like experiments
which search for deviations from the 1/r potential have been performed during the last
years with high precision [13] and require the extra dimensions to have radii not larger
than

100µm, which is the reason to disfavour the case of d = 2.

∼
Thus, it is interesting to look for phenomena that are sensitive to modiﬁcations
of the gravitational interaction at even smaller distances. With this increase of the

How to Create Black Holes on Earth?

gravitational interaction strength, also the probability of gravitational collapse increases
- which is nothing else than black hole formation. In fact, the increase in gravitational
strength is drastic enough that it might allow black hole production here on earth already
within the next couple of month.

3. Black holes in the laboratory

How can one imagine the production of black in a particle accelerator? The nuclei of
two hydrogen atoms (the protons) are accelerated in opposite directions nearly to the
speed of light. When they collide, the subatomic constituents within the hydrogen nuclei
interact. If the distance between these constituents (called quarks and gluons) is small
enough - i.e. smaller than a thousands of a proton diameter - and the energy is high
enough a micro black hole could be formed [14]. The mass of such black holes will be of
the order of a TeV (
ﬁve gold atoms) and therefore be much lighter than the cosmic
black holes we know up to now.

∼

This can be strictly derived by using the higher dimensional Schwarzschild-metric

[15]:

ds2 =

γ(r)dt2 + γ−1(r)dr2 + r2dΩ2

where dΩ(d+3) now is the surface element of the 3 + d - dimensional unit sphere and

Let us now calculate the possible production rate of black holes explicitly.
I.e.,
we consider two elementary particles, approaching each other with a very high kinetic
energy in the c.o.m. system slightly above the new fundamental scale Mf ∼
1 TeV, as
depicted in Figure 2. Since the black hole is not an ordinary particle of the Standard

If the impact parameter,

Model and its correct quantum theoretical treatment is unknown, it is treated as a meta-
stable state, which is produced and decays according to the semi classical formalism of
black hole physics.

400 pb. Using the geometrical cross section formula, it is now possible to compute
the diﬀerential cross section dσ/dM which will tell us how many black holes will be
formed with a certain mass M at a c.o.m. energy √s. The probability that two colliding
particles will form a black hole of mass M in a proton-proton collision at the LHC (at
a center of mass energy of 14 TeV) involves the parton distribution functions. These
functions, fA(x, ˆs), parametrise the probability of ﬁnding a constituent A of the proton
(quark or gluon) with a momentum fraction x of the total energy of the proton. These
constituents are also called partons. Here, √ˆs is the c.o.m. energy of the parton-parton
collision. For details about the calculations of scattering cross sections from parton
distribution functions, the reader is referred to [16].

The diﬀerential cross section is then given by summation over all possible parton

where we insert the estimated luminosity for the LHC, L = 1033cm−2s−1. This yields at
a c.o.m. energy of √s = 14 TeV the total number of 1 billion black holes per year! This
means, about ten black holes per second would be created. The total number of black
holes produced per year at the LHC as a function of the new fundamental mass (being
related to the size of the extra dimensions) is depicted in Fig. 3. The importance of
this process led to a high number of publications on the topic of TeV-mass black holes
at colliders both in scientiﬁc journals [5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] and in the popular press
[23].

→

Especially for teachers and young students it should be noted that numerical
simulation and visualisation packages for the production and decay of black holes in
colliders and from cosmic rays are available. These packages are currently used to explore
potential signatures for black hole production and go by the names CHARYBDIS [24],
GROKE [25, 32] and CATFISH [26].

4. Discussion

The ﬁnal question that remains is: Are these micro black holes dangerous? Up to now it
is still an open question whether these tiny black holes are stable or decay. The British
physicist Stephen Hawking predicted thirty years ago that black holes should decay in
a quantum mechanical process known as the Hawking radiation [27]. The temperature
of this radiation from black holes can be calculated following Hawking’s arguments and

How to Create Black Holes on Earth?

is given by:

T =

,

κ
2π

8

(14)

where κ = 1/2 ∂γ(r)/∂r at r = RH is the surface gravity of the black hole. For the
case of black holes in extra dimensions one obtains κ = (1 + d)/2
1/RH. Putting
numbers in, yields temperatures on the order of several hundred GeV. I.e. the black
hole will explode immediately into all available (standard model) particles. The most
prominent signatures of this explosion would be an event with multiple quark- and gluon-
jet production without back-to-back correlation (as would be expected from processes
of the strong interaction).

·

However, it is unclear whether these calculations are also valid for such micro black
holes. In fact, it is currently discussed that micro black holes can form stable remnants
that might constitute some new form of stable dark matter. If these micro black holes
do radiate, they can be seen in the detectors at CERN due to their extremely high
(Hawking-) temperature of many billion Fahrenheit.

If the black holes are stable, they will fall towards the center of the earth and
will be hidden in the earth’s core. The probability that a black hole remnant starts
to grow inside the earth is proportional to its volume and therefore extremely small.
It would take billions of years before another particle will be caught by this remnant.
In addition one can imagine that ultra high energetic cosmic rays (UHECR) might
have produced micro black holes either by collisions with the earth’s material or the
atmosphere. Assuming a reasonable ﬂux of cosmic neutrinos and there interaction with
earth material over the whole existence of the earth leads to the surprising result that
the earth might have already captured nearly a pound of black holes in its core. The
production of mini black holes from UHECRs has led to many exciting predictions
over the recent years [28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Basically, these studies have found black
hole production rates due to cosmic ray interactions with the earth and its atmosphere
ranging from one black hole per year to one black hole per day. Since cosmic rays
have been hitting the earth for billions of years (possibly resulting in the production of
billions of micro black holes) it can be seen as strong experimental evidence that the
predicted micro black holes do not pose a threat.

While nothing is ever known completely before one has experimentally explored
it, there is no scenario known up to now that leads to any dangerous implications for
mankind from the production of micro black holes on earth.

Fiction or reality?

Let me ﬁnally discuss the likelihood for the production and observation of black holes
in future experiments. It should be clear that several (huge) assumptions have to be
fulﬁlled to make the above predictions a reality:

•

Space time has to have additional space like dimensions to allow for a decrease
of the Planck scale to an experimentally accessible value. While String Theory

How to Create Black Holes on Earth?

indeed predicts a multi-dimensional universe, based on theoretical grounds about
anomaly cancellations, the existence of additional dimensions is still a speculation
today without experimental proof.

The size of the extra dimensions has to be ”large”. Meaning that if the dimensions
extensions are below 10−4
10−5 fm they can not be probed by near future
accelerators. The spatial resolution probed by interactions is at best 1/√s, and
10−6 fm for the
therefore
highest energetic cosmic rays. Unfortunately, many models (not the ADD-model
discussed here) predict only ”small” extra dimensions with sizes around the usual
Planck length.

10−4 fm in proton-proton collisions at LHC and

The unknown new fundamental scale has to be below some ten TeV to allow for
collider studies.

Even if micro black holes are formed, it might be diﬃcult to detect them, because
the emission pattern of small black holes near the Planck mass might be strongly
altered from our expectations.

The aim of this article was to give a brief introduction on recent new ideas about
the geometry of space. A spectacular implication of these new models with additional
dimensions is the increased production probability of black holes. While it might sound
like science ﬁction the next generation particle accelerators will be able to test this
prediction. The experimental program at LHC will start end of the year and might for
the ﬁrst time allow to explore the properties of black holes here on earth.

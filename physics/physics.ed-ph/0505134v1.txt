(Dated: September 3, 2004)

We present a new visualization of the proper-time elapsed along an observer’s worldline. By
supplementing worldlines with light clocks, the measurement of space-time intervals is reduced to
the “counting of ticks.” The resulting space-time diagrams are pedagogically attractive because
they emphasize the relativistic view that “time is what is measured by an observer’s clock.”

I.

INTRODUCTION

Einstein’s special relativity1 forces us to revise our
common-sense notions of time.
Indeed, clocks in rela-
tive motion will generally disagree on the elapsed time
interval measured between two meeting events. The dis-
crepancy is practically undetectable for everyday relative
speeds, but it is quite signiﬁcant when the relative speeds
are comparable to the speed of light. It is therefore neces-
sary to distinguish these time intervals. Thus, we deﬁne
for each observer his “proper-time” as the elapsed time
interval measured by his clock. The goal of this paper is
to ﬁnd a physically intuitive visualization of this concept
of proper-time.

Many textbooks2,3,4,5,6

introduce proper-time by
analyzing the propagation of a light
in a light
clock,1,7,8,9,10,11 which consists of a pair of mirrors that
face each other and are separated by a proper distance
L. One “tick” of this clock is the duration of one round
trip of a light ray bouncing back and forth between these
mirrors. The analysis is usually done in the context of
a simpliﬁed Michelson-Morley apparatus12 whose arms
may be regarded as light clocks. Unfortunately, most
of these presentations2,3,5 work in moving frames of ref-
erence without making the connection to the space-time
formulation, ﬁrst introduced by Minkowski13 in 1907 and
later extended by Einstein.14

Let us recall a quote from J.L. Synge:

...We have in the special theory of rela-
tivity the Minkowskian geometry of a ﬂat 4-
space with indeﬁnite metric... Unfortunately,
it has been customary to avoid this geometry,
and to reason in terms of moving frames of
reference, each with its own Euclidean geome-
try. As a result, intuition about Minkowskian
space-time is weak and sometimes faulty....15
Indeed, when studying observers in relative motion,
it is advantageous to draw a spacetime-diagram of the
situation. However, we are immediately faced with an
important question: “how does one know where to mark
oﬀ the ticks of each clock?” More precisely, “given a stan-
dard of time marked on an observer’s worldline, how does
one calibrate the same standard on the other observer’s
worldline?”

One approach is to use the invariance of the speed of
light to algebraically demonstrate the invariance of the

spacetime-interval, from which the equation of a hyper-
bola arises.4,13 Then, for inertial observers that meet at
a common event O, it can be shown that the correspond-
ing ticks on their clocks [synchronized at event O] trace
out hyperbolas on a spacetime diagram. (See Figure 1.)
Once this result is established, many of the results of spe-
cial relativity follow. This approach, however, is proba-
bly too sophisticated for a novice. Its connection with
the standard textbook approach, using the more familiar
(though provisional) physical concepts of time and space,
is not readily apparent.

In this paper, we connect the two approaches by draw-
ing the spacetime-diagram of the Michelson-Morley ap-
paratus. Surprisingly, the only other spacetime-diagram
of the apparatus is a rough sketch in Synge’s Relativ-
ity: The Special Theory.16

The resulting diagram provides a visualization of
proper-time which explicitly incorporates the principle
of relativity and the invariance of the speed of light. The
standard “eﬀects” of time-dilation,
length-contraction,
and the relativity of simultaneity are easily inferred
In addition, we show that stan-
from the diagram.
dard calculations2,3,6,17,18,19 of the Clock Eﬀect and the
Doppler Eﬀect can be reduced to the “counting of ticks.”

We feel that the resulting diagrams are pedagogically at-
tractive since they emphasize the relativistic view that
“time is measured by an observer’s clock.”

In the last section, we will consider a simpliﬁed ver-
sion of our clock, called the “longitudinal light clock.”
Although this encodes fewer features than the full light
clock, the longitudinal light clock is easy to draw manu-
ally.

In this paper, we have provided the detailed calcula-
tions used to draw the diagrams. However, we believe
that one can ﬁrst qualitatively construct the diagram
for the novice, emphasizing the physical principles ﬁrst.
Then, for those interested, one can continue quantita-
tively with the analytical construction.

Following the standard conventions for spacetime di-
agrams, time runs upward on our spacetime diagrams.
The scales of the axes are chosen so that light rays are
drawn at 45 degrees.

II. A SIMPLIFIED MICHELSON-MORLEY
APPARATUS

A. An apparatus at rest

Our simpliﬁed Michelson-Morley apparatus has a light
source at the origin and two mirrors, each located a dis-
tance L along a set of perpendicular arms.

First, let us draw the spacetime diagram of the appara-
tus in its inertial rest-frame, called the “A-frame.” The
coordinates (x, y, t) will be used to describe the events
from this frame. Since relative motion will be taken to
be along the x-axis, the mirror along the x-axis will be
called the “longitudinal mirror” and the mirror along the
y-axis will be called the “transverse mirror.”

The worldlines of A’s light source and mirrors are de-

scribed parametrically by

A’s light source

x(t) = 0
y(t) = 0

x(t) = 0
y(t) = L

x(t) = L
y(t) = 0.

Special relativity tells us that, in all inertial frames,
light travels through the vacuum with speed c in all

Let event O, with coordinates (0, 0, 0), mark the emis-
sion of a ﬂash of light from the source. One light ray

and its reﬂection is also received at event TA. Hence, the
two rays, emitted at event O and directed in diﬀerent
directions, are received at a common event TA, whose
coordinates are (0, 0, 2L/c). (See Figure 2.)

If one arranges another light ray to be emitted upon
reception (for example, by placing suitably oriented mir-
rors at the source), then this apparatus can serve as a
simple clock—the light clock.

The reception event TA marks one “tick” of this clock.
This tick will be chosen to be the “standard tick.” The
elapsed time logged by an observer sitting at the source
is equal to the number of ticks multiplied by 2L/c, the
duration of one round trip of a light ray.21 If a ﬁner scale
of time is required, one can increase the resolution by
choosing a smaller separation L. In addition, the reﬂec-
tion events XA and YA, which are on mirrors equidistant
from the source, can be regarded as “half-ticks” of this
clock. We deﬁne these half-ticks to be “simultaneous
events for this clock.”

B. An apparatus in motion

Now, suppose an identical apparatus moves with
spatial-velocity v parallel to the x-axis of the A-frame.
This moving inertial-frame will be called the “B-frame,”
and the coordinates (x′, y′, t′) will be used to describe
events from this frame. For simplicity, the origins of
the primed and unprimed coordinate systems are taken
to coincide at the emission event O.
In addition, the
corresponding spatial axes are assumed to be spatially-
parallel22 within each inertial-frame.

Since B’s apparatus is identical to A’s, the worldlines
of B’s light source and mirrors are described parametri-
cally by

B’s light source

B’s transverse mirror

B’s longitudinal mirror

What does the spacetime diagram of this moving ap-
paratus look like in the A-frame? In particular, what are
the (x, y, t) coordinates of the worldlines of the moving
apparatus and of the events XB, YB, and TB?

Since B’s light source and transverse mirror move with

velocity v in the x-direction, they are described as:23

B’s light source

x(t) = vt
y(t) = 0.

x(t) = vt
y(t) = L.

Due to this mirror’s motion, the light ray from event
O that meets this mirror must travel a longer distance
in the A-frame. (See Figure 3.) Using the Pythagorean
(v/c)2)−1/2, which
theorem, we ﬁnd this distance is L(1
(v/c)2)−1/2. Thus,

Now, let us consider the longitudinal mirror. (See Fig-
ure 4.) Recall that the reﬂected light rays for A’s appa-
ratus were received by A’s source at a common event TA.
According to the principle of relativity, the apparatuses
cannot distinguish their states of inertial motion. Thus,
the reﬂected light rays for B’s apparatus must also be
received by B’s source at a common event, here, TB.

light ray from event O to reach B’s longitudinal mirror. Since
ctX = vtB + c(tB − tX) and tB = (2L/c)(1 − (v/c)2)−
1/2,
it can be shown that tX = (L/c)((1 + v/c)/(1 − v/c))1/2.
Furthermore, since ctX = vtX + ℓ, it follows that ℓ = L(1 −
(v/c)2)1/2, which is shorter than the proper length L of A’s
identical apparatus. This is the “length contraction” eﬀect.

For light rays to be received at event TB, what is the
required reﬂection event XB on B’s longitudinal mir-
ror? Event XB is the intersection on the xt-plane of
the forward-directed light ray from event O and the
backward-directed light ray toward event TB.
(Refer
again to Figure 4.) After a little algebra, the reﬂection
event XB is determined to be

Similarly, given the (x′, y′, t′)-coordinates of B’s tick and
half-ticks, the (x, y, t)-coordinates of XB, YB, and TB can
be obtained.

These results are summarized in Figure 5.
In addition to the time-dilation and length-contraction
eﬀects, note that the events XB and YB, which are de-
ﬁned to be simultaneous according to B’s clock, are not
simultaneous according to A’s clock. This is the “rela-
tivity of simultaneity.”

In passing, we observe that the length-contraction fac-
found in the Galilean

transformations,24 enforces the requirement that the re-
ﬂection occur at event XB so that the reﬂected light ray
is received at event TB. Without length contraction,
the reﬂection occurs at event XGal, and the reception
event UGal occurs at the source after event TB. (See Fig-
ure 6.) Such a result violates the principle of relativity
since one’s inertial state of motion could now be detected.
Indeed, the Michelson-Morley apparatus was used to
measure the time diﬀerence between events UGal and TB,
as predicted by the Galilean transformations. However,
no time diﬀerence was experimentally observed.12,25

III. CIRCULAR LIGHT CLOCKS

A. A generalized apparatus

Generalizing the analysis of the last section, it is easy

to see that:

With any relative orientation of the arms one
would obtain the same results:

1. Light rays emitted by the source at event O to
mirrors a distance L away would be received
back at the source at a time 2L/c later.

2. The reﬂection events at the mirrors are simul-

taneous according to that source.

So, instead of a pair of equidistant mirrors, consider a
whole collection of mirrors placed inside a circle [gener-
ally, a sphere] of radius L. Henceforth, this will be called
the “circular light clock.”27 What would the spacetime
diagram of this light clock look like?

In this case, one would have a hollow worldtube to de-
scribe the collection of mirrors for each clock. In addition,
for each tick of a given clock, one would draw the portion
of its light cone contained inside the clock’s worldtube.
These cones represent events in spacetime traced out by
the collection of light rays that reﬂect oﬀ the mirrors from
tick to tick. (See Figure 7.)

In particular, the stationary light clock will be drawn
with a circular cross-section. The moving one will be
drawn tilted with an elliptical cross-section since it is
length-contracted in the direction of relative motion.

5

Then, given a starting emission event on the axis of each
worldtube, one traces out the paths of the light rays and
their reﬂections, which are drawn upward with a slope
of 45 degrees in this diagram. For simplicity, the starting
emission event O is taken to be the intersection of the
two sources. (Refer again to Figure 7.)

We now make a series of observations.
The original pair of reﬂection events XA and YA (and
XB and YB, respectively) are among the events on the
circle of mutual intersections of the worldtube of the light
clock and the light cones of its zeroth and ﬁrst ticks. We
extend our deﬁnition of simultaneity according to this
In fact, one can extend
clock to that circle of events.
this simultaneity to events on the unique [hyper]plane
that contains this circle [respectively, sphere]. Physically,
this [hyper]plane represents “all of space at a particular
instant for this light clock.” As before, the events that
are simultaneous to this light clock are generally diﬀerent
from those events determined to be simultaneous by the
other light clock.

With this notion of simultaneity, the light cones can be
interpreted in a complementary way. For each light clock,
a simultaneous “slice” of its cones represents a circular
[respectively, spherical] wavefront traveling at the speed

length-contracted in this inertial frame.

of light. Hence, the light cone can also be interpreted as
a sequence of wavefronts traveling at the speed of light.28

B. Visualizing proper-time

By continuing this light-clock construction along each
inertial observer’s worldtube, an accurate visual repre-
sentation of the proper time elapsed for each observer is
obtained. From such a diagram, however, it may not be
evident that the two observers are equivalent.

First, we demonstrate their

symmetry with the
Doppler Eﬀect. (See Figure 8.) Suppose these inertial
observers emit light signals at one-tick intervals. From
the diagram, each observer receives those signals from the
other observer at three-tick intervals.
In other words,
the received frequency is one-third of the original fre-
quency, in accordance with the Doppler eﬀect for two
observers separating with speed v = 0.8c. In general, a
light ray emitted by a source at its ﬁrst tick after sepa-
ration reaches the receiver at the receiver’s kth tick af-
ter separation, where k is the Doppler-Bondi factor de-
ﬁned in equation 6. This is the basis of the Bondi k-
calculus.19,26,29,30

Next, we demonstrate their symmetry with the time-
dilation eﬀect. (Refer again to Figure 8.) Consider the
signal emitted at the ﬁrst tick. As just noted, this signal
is received by the receiver at his third tick. According
to the source of that signal, that distant reception event
is simultaneous with his ﬁfth tick. In other words, the
apparent elapsed time assigned to a distant event is ﬁve-
thirds as long as the proper elapsed time measured by the
inertial observer who visits that distant event. In general,
the apparent elapsed time assigned to a distant event is
γ times as long as the proper elapsed time measured by
the inertial observer who meets that distant event, where
γ is the time-dilation factor deﬁned in equation 5.

In addition, the source measures the apparent distance
(γk ticks).

to that reception event to be vtapparent = v
For v = 0.8c, this is

·

Since L is the radius of the worldtube and 1 tick =
(2L/c), this distance can be expressed as “four worldtube
diameters.” This suggests the diagrams in Figure 9. Of
course, this is just the calculation of the square-interval
in terms of the temporal and spatial coordinates

velocity v = −0.8c for another 3 ticks. Between the departure
and reunion events, he has logged 6 ticks for his entire trip,
whereas the inertial observer has logged 10 ticks.

From the diagram, the non-inertial observer travels
away with velocity v = 0.8c for 3 ticks, then returns
with velocity v =
0.8c for another 3 ticks. Between the
departure and reunion events, he has logged 6 ticks for
his entire trip. On the other hand, the inertial clock logs

In addition, the two observers are certainly inequiva-
lent. The kink in the non-inertial worldline causes the se-
quence of simultaneous events to change discontinuously,
leading to the apparent break in the non-inertial world-
tube. This is not to say that the non-inertial worldtube
actually breaks. Rather, it is an artifact of how the dia-
gram was drawn. In order to draw the true worldtube, a
more careful analysis with a detailed model of the appa-
ratus is needed. We refer the reader to some articles on
the Clock Eﬀect that discuss this kink in the non-inertial
observer’s worldline.10,19,30

D. A brief summary

Let us summarize the logical development up to this

point.

Given the simpliﬁed Michelson-Morley apparatus in
relative motion, the invariance of the speed of light (so
that all light rays are drawn at an angle of 45 degrees) is
used to draw the light rays associated with the perpen-
dicular arm. Invoking the principle of relativity (so that
the duration of the round-trip deﬁnes the same standard
tick), we deduce the eﬀect of time dilation. Again using
the invariance of the speed of light, we draw the light
rays associated with the parallel arm. Again invoking
the principle of relativity, we deduce the eﬀects of length
contraction and the relativity of simultaneity.

Generalizing these results to arbitrary directions, we
obtain the circular light clock. By continuing this con-
struction along a piecewise-inertial worldline, we obtain
a visual representation of the proper-time elapsed along
that worldline.

IV. LONGITUDINAL LIGHT CLOCKS

Let us now consider a simpliﬁed two-dimensional ver-
sion of the light clock diagram. Consider the worldlines
of the source and of one longitudinal mirror, that is, the
longitudinal light clock. As before, the moving light clock
appears length-contracted in the direction of relative mo-
tion. In this case, we have the following diagrams. (See
Figures 11 and 12.)

Although these ﬁgures are much easier to draw, it is
unfortunate that the role of length contraction appears
here so prominently. Recall that event TB was deter-
mined using the invariance of the speed of light and the
principle of relativity, which required that the transverse
and longitudinal reﬂections be received simultaneously at
the source. However, without the transverse direction,
the role of invariance may not be evident.

In this section, we will draw attention to a certain ge-
ometric property of this diagram and use it to emphasize
instead the “invariance of the spacetime interval”.

Consider the triangles

OXBTB, which
are formed from the timelike intervals from event O to
the ﬁrst ticks and their associated light rays. Since, on
a spacetime diagram, events TA and TB are at equal in-
tervals from event O, they lie on a rectangular hyperbola
asymptotic to the light cone of event O. From this, it
can be shown that these triangles (which are related by
Lorentz transformations) have the same area. In fact, we
will show in Section IV B that this area is proportional
to the square-interval of one tick.31

With this property, we can now draw the longitudinal
light clock with the emphasis on the invariance of the
interval, rather than on length contraction.

Given the standard tick for the stationary observer
(events O, TA, and XA) and the worldline of a mov-
ing observer (line OF ), one can determine the standard
tick for the moving observer (events O, XB and TB) as
follows.

Determine the reception event TB by tracing the

Determine the worldline of the longitudinal mirror
by drawing through XB the parallel to OF . This
displays the length contraction eﬀect.

Finally, determine a set of simultaneous events for
this clock by ﬁrst completing the parallelogram
with sides OXB and XBTB and then drawing the
diagonal through XB. This displays the relativity
of simultaneity.

B. An invariant area

The following calculation reveals that this area of the
triangles used in the previous section is proportional to
the square-interval of one tick.31

Since we will be discussing an aspect of the geometry
of the spacetime diagram, it is convenient to work with a
more natural set of coordinates (x/c, t), where now each
coordinate has the same units.

Consider the segment drawn from the emission event O
to any event T with coordinates (x/c, t). (See Figure 14.)
Regard that segment as the hypotenuse of a Euclidean
right triangle whose sides are parallel to the light cone of

These are called the Dirac light-cone coordinates31,32 of

Let us explicitly verify that this area is invariant under

It is instructive to interpret this geometrically. For
concreteness, let us start with T = TB and X = XB. In
this case, we seek the Lorentz transformation that sets
OTB to be at rest in the B-frame. Imagine sliding TB
down along the hyperbola until OTB is vertical. As that
happens, XB slides down the light cone, scaling the ξ-leg
down by a factor k and scaling the η-leg up by a factor k.
Thus, the area of triangle

OXBTB is invariant.

We extend this result to the parallelogram formed with
light rays OXB and XBTB, i.e., the “area of intersec-
tion between the interior of O’s future light-cone and the
interior of TB’s past light-cone.” Clearly, this area is in-
variant and is proportional to the square-interval of one
tick.

In fact, this result generalizes to higher-dimensions:
the analogous volume of intersection between the light-
cone interiors is also invariant and is proportional to the
square-interval of one tick. We show this for the 3- and
4-dimensional case. The Euclidean volume of a cone with
an elliptical base is (πab)h/3, where a and b are the semi-
major and semi-minor axes of the elliptical base, and h is
the altitude of the cone. In four dimensions, the hyper-
volume of a cone with an ellipsoidal base is (4πab2/3)h/4.
Since we orient the base so that b is a length along the
transverse direction,
it is unchanged under a Lorentz

V. FINAL REMARKS

By drawing the spacetime diagram of a Michelson-
Morley apparatus, we have obtained an accurate visu-
alization of the proper-time elapsed along a piecewise-
inertial observer’s worldline. Measurements of spacetime
intervals have been reduced to the counting of ticks, em-
phasizing the relativistic view that “time is measured by
an observer’s clock.” We believe that the resulting dia-
gram can be used to discuss special relativity in a qual-
itative way which emphasizes the physics ﬁrst and the
algebra second. We feel this could easily be incorpo-

rated into the standard textbook treatments of special
relativity, which often discuss the Michelson-Morley ex-
periment.

The ideas presented in this paper are being imple-
mented in a series of interactive computer programs
which will be posted to our website.34

22 This is the usual convention for “aligning” the spatial axes.
In special relativity, the x- and x′- axes are not parallel in
spacetime. However, in the A-frame, the spatial-projection
of the x′-axis is parallel to the x-axis, and conversely for
the B-frame. By contrast, in Galilean relativity, the corre-
sponding spatial axes are parallel in both the spatial and
spacetime senses.

23 Strictly speaking, we should prove that, for a moving ob-
ject, lengths along its transverse directions are unchanged.

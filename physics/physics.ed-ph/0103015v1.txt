Introduction It is always a good practice to provide the physical content of an
analytical result. The following algebraic inequality lends itself well to this purpose:
For any ﬁnite sequence of real numbers r1, r2, ..., rN , we have

1 + r

3
2 + ... + r

N )

2 ≤ (r

2 + ... + r

.

(r

(1)

A standard proof is given in [1]. An alternative proof follows from the isoperimetric
inequality

3 ≥ 36πV

A

,

where A is the surface area and V the volume of any three-dimensional body. Setting
the area A = P

N
i=1 4πr2 and the volume V = P

N
i=1(4/3)πr3 yields (1).

A Bubble Proof We give yet another proof, now using elements of surface tension
theory and ideal gas laws to the formation and coalescence of bubbles. This proof,
found in [2], runs as follows.
According to a well-known result in surface tension theory, when a spherical bubble
of radius R is formed in the air, there is a diﬀerence of pressure between the inside
and the outside of the surface ﬁlm given by

p = p0 +

2T
R

,

(2)

where p0 is the (external) atmospheric pressure on the surface ﬁlm of the bubble, p
is the internal pressure, and T is the surface tension that maintains the bubble [3].

Suppose initially that N spherical bubbles of radii R1, R2, ..., RN ﬂoat in the air
under the same surface tension T and internal pressures p1, p2, ...pN . According to
(2),

pk = p0 +

k = 1, 2, ...N.

2T
Rk

,

Now suppose that all N bubbles come close enough to be drawn together by surface
tension and combine to form a single spherical bubble of radius R and internal
pressure p, also obeying Eq. (2). When this happens, the product of the internal
pressure p and the volume v of the resulting bubble formed by the coalescence of
the initial bubbles is, according to the ideal gas law [3], given by

where vk (k=1,2,..., N) are the volumes of the individual bubbles before the coales-
cence took place. For spherical bubbles, (4) becomes

pv = p1v1 + ... + pN vN ,

pR

= p1R

1 + ... + pN R

N .

Substituting the values of p and pk given in (2) and (3) into (5), we obtain

1 − R

2 − ... − R

N =

(R

).

2T
p0

Now, if the total amount of air in the bubbles does not change, the surface area of
the resulting bubble formed by the coalescence of the bubbles is always smaller than
the sum of the surface area of the individual bubbles before coalescence. Thus,

1 + R

2
2 + ... + R

N ≥ R

.

R

Since the potential energy of a bubble is proportional to its surface area, (7) is
a physical condition that the surface energy of the system is minimal after the
coalescence.

It follows from (7) and the fact that p0 and T are positive constants that the

left hand side of equation (6) satisﬁes

1 + R

2 + ... + R

N ≤ R

R

The equality, which implies conservation of volumes, holds when the excess pressure
in the bubble ﬁlm is much less the atmospheric pressure. Combining (7) and (8)
yields the inequality (1), which is also valid for negative numbers.

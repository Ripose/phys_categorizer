Some remarks on the question of

charge densities in stationary–current–carrying conductors

L. Baroni, 1 E. Montanari, 2 and A.D. Pesci 1

Abstract. Recently, some discussions arose as to the deﬁnition of charge and

the value of the density of charge in stationary–current–carrying conductors.

We stress that the problem of charge deﬁnition comes from a misunderstanding

of the usual deﬁnition. We provide some theoretical elements which suggest that

positive and negative charge densities are equal in the frame of the positive ions.

1. Introduction

Recently Ivezi´c [1–4] has questioned the correctness of the usual charge

deﬁnition and raised the problem of the charge density inside a current–carrying

conductor. He gives a new deﬁnition of charge and suggests that the ion charge

density, as measured in the ions reference frame, could be equal to the electron

charge density as measured in the electrons reference frame. This is contrary

to the usual view that these two charge densities are equal in the ions reference

frame. A consequence of Ivezi´c’s assumption is that outside a conducting wire

there should be a static electric ﬁeld when a stationary current is ﬂowing in the

conductor. This author also claims that in the seventies some experiments were

carried out [5–7] (actually also recently in [8,9]) which are in agreement with

this new deﬁnition of charge. As a consequence of Ivezi´c’s papers, many authors

[10–13] have taken up a deﬁnite position against his ideas which provoked a

discussion which, in our opinion, has not yet settled down the question. The

paper is organized as follows. In sect. 2 we show that the usual charge deﬁnition

is the correct one; in sect. 3 we show how to deal correctly with invariant

integrals, while in sect. 4 we disprove Ivezi´c’s hypothesis of the non–zero electric

ﬁeld outside current–carrying conductors.

2. Independence of the charge on the velocity

Purcell [14] had pointed out that the independence of the charge from the

velocity means that the integral

1
4π ZA(t)

E da = Q

(2.1)

does not depend on the motion of the particles inside the closed surface A(t);

moreover, if we choose another closed surface which contains the same number

of particles, then the value of the ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld from this surface is

2

the same. If this happens for an inertial reference frame then, because of the

principle of relativity, it must be true for any other inertial frame. Therefore,

if we consider in a frame O a system of charges at the time t in a volume

surrounded by the closed surface A(t) and in a frame O′ in motion with constant

velocity with respect to O any volume which contains at the time t′ the same

particles surrounded by the closed surface A′(t′), then

E da =

ZA(t)

ZA′(t′)

E′

da′

(2.2)

where the two integrals are evaluated at the times t and t′ respectively. We

want to point out that eq. (2.2) does not give a recipe to obtain the closed

surface A′(t′) nor the time at which to perform the integration once A(t) has

been given. Only for a closed system inside a surface A (here with closed system

we mean that no charges cross its boundaries) it is correct to take the surface,

for instance, as simultaneously seen in O′ and perform the integration in any

instant of time t′. In this case in fact the problem is independent of time. On

the contrary, if we consider a non–closed system, like a piece of wire with a

steady current, then it is not trivial to choose a correct surface in O′ (a possible

wayout of this diﬃculty has been proposed in [10]).

Purcell in his deﬁnition of invariance of charge does only state that equa-

tion (2.2) must hold if, and only if, the boundaries in the two reference frames

contain the same particles. And this is equivalent to admit the postulate that

the charge of a particle does not depend on its motion. These speciﬁcations

are to show the right way in which eq. (2.2) should be interpreted. In fact we

think that in [1, 4] there has been a misunderstanding about the meaning and

validity of equation (2.2).

We want to stress that the invariance of the charge as deﬁned in (2.2), i.e.

its independence from motion, is a consequence of the fact that the equation of

3

charge conservation is a continuity equation

∂ρ
∂t

+ divj = 0 ,

(2.3)

fulﬁlled in every inertial frame.

To show this let us consider a charge at rest in the origin of an inertial

frame O. At the time t = 0 we turn on a suitable ﬁeld of force which causes

an acceleration along the x direction for a time τ . Therefore, at the time t = τ

the charge is moving with a uniform velocity V in the x direction. Now let us

consider a closed spherical surface with centre at the origin and radius r0 large

enough not to be crossed by the charge for an interval of time I = [τ, T ] (where

T > τ ). If we integrate eq. (2.3) in this reference frame on the volume enclosed

by that surface for every t < T we obtain

dQ
dt

=

ρdV = −

j da = 0

(2.4)

This means that the total charge inside a close surface is not aﬀected by the

state of motion but can vary if and only if some charged particles cross the

This reasoning can be done for any number of charges and any initial

conﬁguration. Therefore (2.2) (in the sense and with the speciﬁcation we have

made) derives from the assumption of equation (2.3) for the conservation of

boundary.

charge.

All these considerations show that a correct way to think about charge

conservation is the continuity equation. According to this equation, it is not

important that the charge in a certain volume does not change, but what mat-

ters is the fact that the change should be only due to the charges that cross the

closed surface which is the boundary of that volume.

3. The invariant integral of charge

4

If we want to consider a relativistic scalar quantity, that is something

which is invariant under Lorentz transformation, eq. (2.2) becomes useless ﬁrst

because the integrand is not written as a relativistic scalar and second because

there is no a priori relation between A(t) and A′(t′). One thing is to say that

equation (2.2) holds and another one is to construct an invariant quantity. The

ﬁrst statement means that the charge does not depend on the velocity. The

second means that if we want to ﬁnd, in a relativistic invariant way, the same

amount of charges in two diﬀerent reference frames we must also take into

account the fact that the diﬀerence of simultaneity gives rise to diﬀerences as

to the charges contained contemporaneously in a volume [15]. To obtain such

an invariant quantity we must consider as integrand a relativistic scalar and a

hypersurface as a domain. In this way if one changes the inertial frame, the

value of the integral remains the same, but its meaning in the two frames is in

general diﬀerent because of the diﬀerence of simultaneity. As pointed out by

[11] the correct invariant quantity is that given in [16], that is

Q =

1
c ZH

jµdSµ

where H is a hypersurface.

In this way Q turns out to be the sum of those

charges the world lines of which cross this hypersurface. When one has to do

with integrals over hypersurfaces, the way to handle them is to parametrize the

domain.

In the four–dimensional space–time of special relativity this means

that we must consider the coordinates as functions of three real parameters,

that is to say

xµ = φµ(ui)

ui ∈ Ui ⊂ ℜ

Then by deﬁnition

i ∈ 1, 2, 3

nµ = (φu1 ∧ φu2 ∧ φu3 )µ = −

and

If we perform a Lorentz transformation, then one has

so that integral (3.3) is invariant under Lorentz transformation.

Another way to consider integral (3.1) is by means of diﬀerential forms.

In fact let us consider jµ as the components of the 1–form

J = jµ dxµ

From (3.8) we can deﬁne the dual 3–form ∗J :

∗J =

jαβγdxα ∧ dxβ ∧ dxγ

1
6

jαβγ = eαβγµjµ

where eαβγµ is the totally antisymmetric tensor as deﬁned, for instance, in

paragraph 6 of ref. [16]. With these deﬁnitions integral (3.1) can be written as

(see, for instance, Box 4.1 D in ref. [17])

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

Q =

∗J

ZH

If we consider the exterior derivative of ∗J we see that it is zero because of

the continuity equation (2.3); that is to say ∗J is the exterior derivative of

a 2–form. This 2–form is the dual of the tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

F = Fµν dxµ ∧ dxν:

d∗F =

4π
c

∗J

(3.11)

This is very important in the calculation of (3.10). In fact this implies (as in

the one–dimensional case when one deals with an exact 1–form) that the value

of the integral is left unchanged when, in order to simplify the calculatins, we

deform the hypersurface of the domain leaving the boundaries unaltered.

This way to perform calculation is equivalent to the one used in [11]. The

only diﬀerence is that Bili´c in [11] considers a two dimensional space–time. In

this particular situation the integrand is an exact diﬀerential form (because of

the continuity equation) and so the value of the integral is the same for any path

of integration between the points A and B which must be the same contrary to

what has been said in [4]. In other words, this means that in [4] Ivezi´c does not

interpret correctly eq (3.1).

The way in which we have considered integral (3.1) implies automatically

that we are dealing with the same total carge as well with the same charged

particles in the two reference frames. The root of this lies in the continuity

equation. In fact, on the one hand, one has to remember (as pointed out by

Ivezi´c in [4]) that jµ is a four–vector because of the postulate of relativity that

imposes the covariance of continuity equation. In this way jµ dSµ is a scalar

(and therefore we are dealing with the same charged particles). On the other

hand, if we have the same particles, the continuity equation implies that we

have also the same total charge, independent on their state of motion.

In this way we have stressed once more that, as pointed out by paragraph

29 of ref.

[16] and Box 4.1 D of ref.

[17], the invariance of charge, stated by

7

equation (3.1), is strictly related to the continuity equation of charge (2.3).

4. The non–zero electric ﬁeld hypotesis

Even if in [1] the questions of the exact way to interpret the charge in-

variance and of the existence of an E 6= 0 externally to a current–carrying

conductor may seem to be related, actually they are not (as stressed in [4]).

Historically, the existence of an E 6= 0 outside a current–carrying conduc-

tor was largely discussed in the literature (see, for instance, [5] sect. 1). Even

if the usual belief is that such an E does not exist, however there is no exper-

imental evidence. This question is not settled in the framework of the usual

Maxwell theory (where the charge is assumed not to depend on the velocity);

it can in fact happen that the positive charge density in a ﬂowing current turns

out to be diﬀerent from that of negative charges.

According to [1] the problem of the existence of this ﬁeld can be traced

back to that of knowing in which frame λ+ = λ−. In [1,4] and [18] it is clearly

stressed that two physical hypoteses are relevant to this point. The ﬁrst one

assumes that λ+ = λ− in the wire frame, and this gives E = 0 according to the

common belief; the second one assumes that λ+ (as evaluated in the ions rest

frame) is equal to λ− (as evaluated in the electrons rest frame). Ivezic prefers

the latter because the charges are treated in a symmetric way. He also believes

that some experimental results conﬁrm it [5].

According to Ivezi´c view one expects a radial ﬁeld E = δλ/(2πr) where

δλ is the absolute value of the diﬀerence of charge density in the rest frame of

the lattice and r is the radial distance from the wire. It turns out that

a second order quantity in v/c and therefore extremely small under ordinary

conditions. This fact prevented from verifying its existence until now. One

can hope that experiments with superconducting materials like those reported

in [5] can settle the question. Such experiments have been however proposed

not to this end but to measure possible second–order deviation from Maxwell’s

equations due to an hypothetical dependence of the charge on the velocity; in

fact it was taken for granted by these experimentalists that ions and electrons

charge densities where the the same in the rest frame of the ions. This same

assumption was made in the paper by Baker [19] who has shown, starting from

Lienard-Wiechert potentials, that there is no electric ﬁeld produced by the

charge drift in a current–carrying conductor in accordance with Gauss’s law.

Ivezi´c in [1] and [4] raised the question of the possible existence of E 6= 0

outside a current–carrying conductor in the framework of Maxwell’s equations

without postulating a charge dependence on the velocity as proposed in [5] but

assuming λ+ 6= λ− in ions frame.

be equal in the ions frame.

In our opinion there are at least three reasons why the two densities should

The ﬁrst one is related with thermal motion. Already in [12], Singal

asked why Ivezi´c did not take into consideration the eﬀects of thermal noise of

electrons. In his words this means that “it is not clear how in Ivezi´c’s approach

the eﬀects of the thermal velocities of electrons, many orders of magnitude larger

than their drift velocities, could in some unambiguous way be incorporated or

at least shown to cancel, since his derived electric ﬁelds (see eq. (4.1)) depend

upon the square of the velocity of moving charges.” It is clear that if we consider

an isolated conductor its charge cannot vary. But let us consider the case of a

wire that connects two charge reservoirs. Let us suppose that the distribution of

the velocity of electrons at a certain temperature T (ions are considered at rest

because of their large mass) is given by a function fT (v) = fT (−v) normalized

9

to unity (that is to say

in motion with velocity v with respect to ions. If Ivezi´c ideas are correct, in

ℜ fT (v)dv = 1). Let us call O(v) the reference frames
R

that frame the charge density of electrons with velocity lying in the interval

(v, v + dv) must be equal to that of the ions in O(0) with the opposite sign.

This means that in the ions rest frame these electrons are characterized by a

linear charge density λ(v) = −γ(v)λ+. In this way the linear negative–charge

density would be given by

Λ(T ) =

λ(v)fT (v)dv

(4.2)

+∞

Z

−∞

where Λ depends only on the temperature T . This means that there is an

excess of negative charge per unit length of the amount δλ(T ) = λ+ + Λ(T ).

If we consider ordinary temperature, the gas of electrons in the conductor is

almost completely degenerate. In this way we can give an extimation of fT (v)

independent of the temperature. To get the order of magnitude we can put

f (v) =

v ≤ |vF |

(4.3)

2vF

where vF is the Fermi velocity. In this way up to the second order in (vF /c)

The linear charge excess is then given by

.

(4.4)

(4.5)

For a centimeter of copper wire with a cross section S = 10−4 cm2, taking into

account that vF = 1.56 × 108 cm/sec and λ+ = 8.5 × 1022eS C/cm (where e is
the absolute value of the electron charge) one has a charge Q = 6 × 10−6C!

A second way to look at the problem of charge density is to consider the

current ﬂowing in the wire as due to an acceleration of electrons at rest in the

10

wire caused by an applied electric ﬁeld. The steady state is reached because

of the inner resistance of the wire. Now all the electrons undergo the same

accelerating ﬁeld and therefore, assuming the same initial velocity (in this case

equal to zero), their distance cannot change in the ions frame (cf. chapt. 20

in ref [16]). This means by the way that during the acceleration the proper

distance among electrons increases due to the Lorentz contraction.

As a third consideration about Ivezi´c problem, we take into account Ohm’s

law. In the interior of a conductor at rest one has

j = σE

(4.6)

where σ is the conductivity. By means of Gauss’s law divE = 4πρ and the

continuity equation, one easily ﬁnds an equation for the density of the charge

inside a conductor

The solution of this equation is

∂ρ
∂t

+ 4πσρ = 0

ρ = ρ0exp

−

(cid:18)

t
τ (cid:19)

(4.7)

(4.8)

where τ = (4πσ)−1 ≃ 10−18 sec that is a time which is correct to take equal to

zero in a macroscopic theory. This implies that conduction electrons inside a

conductor have always the same density as ions. Moreover, for steady currents

0 = divj = 4πσρ, that is to say ρ = 0. Therefore, Ohm’s law requires that

inside a conducting wire the two charge densities are equal in the reference

frame of ions. A possible charge excess, as that assumed by Ivezi´c, can only

stay on the surface and this destroys the symmetry reason invoked by him.

Therefore, it appears reasonable that the birth of a current does not modify

the electron charge density in the frame in which ions are at rest (and in which

also the electrons were at rest before an electric ﬁeld was applied).

11

In conclusion, even though Ivezi´c has the merit to have stressed that both

situations (i.e. charge densities equal in the frame of the wire or in their own

reference frame) are compatible with Maxwell’s equation, the above considera-

tions (which lie outside the domain of this theory) show however that the ﬁrst

of the two situation envisaged, i.e. the one commonly assumed, is the right one.

5. Conclusions

We have shown that the question raised by Ivezi´c about the non–invariance

of the charge under Lorentz trasformations was originated by a misunderstand-

ing of the usual charge deﬁnition.

If such deﬁnition is properly understood,

one has the usual charge invariance and there is no necessity of looking for new

invariant charges as claimed by Ivezi´c.

As to the ambiguity pointed out by Ivezi´c about the reference frame in

which the positive charge density should be equal to the negative one in a

conductor carrying a stationary current, we have shown that the usual belief,

that is to say that λ+ = λ− in ions rest frame, is the correct one.

In fact,

if one assumes Ivezi´c’s idea, the following three facts, clearly in contrast with

experimental results, should happen: 1) there should be present very big eﬀects

due to the thermal motion of the electrons; 2) the same accelerating ﬁeld on the

same particles with the same initial velocities would change the mean distance

among them; 3) Ohm’s law would be no longer valid.

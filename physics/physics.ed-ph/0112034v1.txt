Abstract

Hadron spectra and other properties of quark systems are studied in the framework of a non-

relativistic spin-independent phenomenological model. The conﬁning potential is chosen as an

harmonic one, which allowed to obtain analytical solutions for both meson and baryon (of equal

constituent quarks) spectra. The introduced parameters are ﬁxed from the low-lying levels of the

heavy quark mesons. The requirement of ﬂavor independence is imposed and it restricts the possible

choices of the potentials, that having an harmonic conﬁning part, could be complemented by a

non-harmonic term without destroying the analytical solution. The hyper-spherical coordinates

are considered for the solution of the three body problem.

INTRODUCTION.

The study of the hadron spectra is a fundamental and open ﬁeld in theoretical physics.

Up to the moment there are three approaches to this subject: Lattice QCD, QCD sum rules

and potential models. Lattice QCD is the most fundamental approach and together with

QCD sum rules have had a good success. Potential models, although less fundamental, have

proved to be very useful even in non-relativistic approximations. Since the latest seventies

a lot of attempts have been made in this ﬁeld with very good results1.

An important question for the use of potential models is whether it is possible to con-

sider hadrons as non-relativistic bound states of quarks. For answering this question the

Schrodinger equation should be solved assuming a QQ potential and then it should be

checked if the obtained quark velocities are non-relativistic. For the charmonium system

this was done in Ref.2 and it was obtained a result of

v2/c2

= 0.2 in the ground state. For

h

i

lighter hadrons the results are no so good and the validity of the non-relativistic approxima-

tion depends strongly from the interaction potential chosen. For example, the interaction

potential proposed by De Rujula, Georgi and Glashow3 was shown4 to be unsuitable for

dynamical non-relativistic calculations of light hadrons. However, Martin showed latter5,6,7

that a non-relativistic model with a power law potential is able to describe heavy quark

mesons and the clearly relativistic ss states. The potential proposed by Martin had the

form

V (r) = A + Brα,

where A =

8.093 GeV , B = 6.898 GeV and α = 0.1.

−

The study of baryon systems with this power law potential was done by Richard8 obtain-

ing good results. At that time the baryon spectrum in potential models, although rather

elaborated9, was completely disconnected from the meson sector. Exceptions were some

attempts to derive meson and baryon potential energies from a common framework as the

instanton, string or bag model. The rule adopted by Richard for the QQ potential was

Studies with phenomenological potentials, like the Cornell one, but considering a rela-

tivistic kinetic energy term, are able to describe the observed spectra of heavy and light

hadron systems14,15. And a non-trivial connections between these relativistic potential mod-

els and rigorous numerical results from lattice QCD have been demonstrated16. Some recent

works have tried to understand why the non-relativistic treatment works and allows useful

predictions even for relativistic systems17,18.

Central conditions in all the models previously mentioned are the ﬂavor independence of

the potential chosen, and the existence of a conﬁning term.

In the present work we study the hadron spectra within a non-relativistic spin-

independent phenomenological model, with an harmonic conﬁning potential. The idea is

to show with an educational perspective what can be done with the Schrodinger equation,

the very useful for physicists harmonic potential and the same number of parameters used in

almost all the calculations; in order to understand the hadron spectroscopy. The harmonic

potential has the great advantage that allows to obtain analytical solutions for both the

meson and baryon (with equal constituent quarks) spectra. Although the obtained results

are maybe not as good as the ones obtained for the former potentials, we think that they

3

give a very good estimates of the hadron properties without the need of the numerical calcu-

lations implemented for all the previously mentioned potentials. As we will work with a spin

independent model, the magnitudes we will deal with will be spin averaged. For ﬁtting our

parameters spin averages of experimental values were calculated, but for certain resonances

the experimental values were not at hand19 and theoretical results obtained by Fulcher20

were used. It should be mentioned that the Klein-Gordon equation for a quadratic potential

was solved and employed for studying mesons by Ram and Hasala21.

The exposition will be organized as follows. In Section II the meson spectra is calcu-

lated for two diﬀerent potentials, with harmonic conﬁning terms and that allow to obtain

analytical solutions. The ﬁrst potential is the harmonic oscillator and the second one is the

harmonic oscillator plus a term proportional to 1

dependent and independent cases, the last condition restricts the possible potentials.

In

Section III we study the properties of the radial wave-function, and some related physical

quantities, at the origen. Section IV is devoted to the study of the baryon spectra and the

summary can be found in Section 5. Finally, an Appendix was introduced for mathematical

details of the three body problem solution.

II. MESON SPECTRA

In the present section, the non-relativistic meson spectra is calculated for two diﬀerent

potentials. The ﬁrst one is the pure harmonic potential and in the second one a term

the solution in the region r

an unique potential like this for charmonium and upsilon systems (parameters 2µα out of

iState employed in our ﬁt of the s quark mass.

As it can be seen the theoretical results obtained are only estimates for the experimental

values. The main diﬀerences between these theoretical results and the experimental ones,

or other theoretical calculations, are clearly due to the non singularity of the potential at

7

the origin, and its concavity. That is, the harmonic potential has positive second derivative

at variance with other proposed potentials, that vary more slowly with the distance. This

causes that when the energy of a state increases, the classical allowed region will be smaller

for the harmonic potential than for the other ones and the states result more localized.

Other undesirable eﬀects are the constant spacing between the consecutive levels and the

degeneracy present. The diﬀerences between the proposed potential and the former ones

also causes the so called constituent quarks masses to be here like twice of the usual values

for the heavy quarks c, b and ﬁfth times for the s quarks. The addition of the non harmonic

term improved the results for the lower levels and broke the degeneracy present, but for the

higher excited states the deﬁciencies remain and the potential was also unable to ﬁt with

the ﬂavor independence condition.

III. PROPERTIES OF THE RADIAL WAVE-FUNCTION AT THE ORIGIN AND

RELATED MAGNITUDES

As it was mentioned in the previous section, the major reason for diﬀerences between our

calculation and previous ones is the non-singularity of the potential at the origin, and its

concavity. The value of the radial wave-function or its ﬁrst non-vanishing derivative at the

origin

V. CONCLUSIONS

In the present paper we have studied, within a non-relativistic spin-independent model

with harmonic conﬁning potential, the spectra and other properties of hadron systems.

It was found that for mesons, without imposing the ﬂavor independence condition, two

possible potentials with harmonic conﬁning terms had analytical solutions that give good

estimates of the experimental values reported for the meson spectra. The better ﬁt was

obtained for the potential with a term proportional to 1

r2 because it has a singularity for
0 that improves its behavior in this region. However this potential was found to be

r

incompatible with the ﬂavor independence condition and was not considered in the analysis

→

that followed.

12

For the pure harmonic oscillator the parameters introduced were ﬁxed from the low ly-

ing levels of heavy quarks systems and imposing the ﬂavor independence condition. The

calculation of the meson and baryon spectra, leptonic widths and hyperﬁne splitting with

this potential give good estimates of the experimental and other theoretical calculations.

Although this potential is far from being a good approximation for the real inter-quark

potential, and the results are no so good as the theoretically obtained by other phenomeno-

logical models, it has the great advantage that allows to obtain analytical solutions for both

meson and baryon spectra. That is, reasonable theoretical results are obtained without the

need of numerical methods and computational calculations. The major diﬀerences of this

potential and the others mentioned in the introduction are due to its non-singularity at the

origin and its concavity, that also cause (for a better ﬁt with experiments) the so called

constituent masses to be bigger than the usual ones. The baryon spectrum was studied with

the use of the rule (2) for the QQ potential and for obtaining the analytical solution it was

necessary to restrict the study to equal constituent quark systems.

We ﬁnalize with the conclusions of A. Martin in Ref.7 “... if you want to know the mass

of a particle and if you have a little time (in years!) and little money you should forget all

your prejudices and use potential models”.

APPENDIX A: THE HYPER-SPHERICAL COORDINATES AND THE SOLU-

TION OF THE THREE BODY PROBLEM WITH AN HARMONIC POTENTIAL

The hyper-spherical coordinates are very useful for dealing with the three body problem,

in what follows we make a small review of their introduction.

The kinetic energy of the Hamiltonian (20),

∇
(cid:0)
can be written as a Laplacian in a 6-dimensional space, due to the symmetry in the two Jacobi

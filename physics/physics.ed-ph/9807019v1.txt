Abstract

We argue that the process of constructing the quantum mechanical current
of the Pauli equation by copying the line of arguments used in the spin-0 case,
i.e. the Schr¨odinger equation, is ambiguous. We show that a non-relativistic re-
duction of the relativistic Dirac four-vector current is, however, capable of fully
resolving the problem. This analysis reveals that the non-relativistic current of
the Pauli equation should include an extra term of the form ∇×(ψ†σψ). We
present an initial exploration of the potential consequences of this new ’spin-
term’ by solving the Pauli equation for crossed magnetic and electric ﬁelds and
calculating the corresponding current.

Most of the applications of Quantum Mechanics (QM) can be found in the
realm of the three phases of matter: gases, liquids and solids where a non-relativistic
quantum mechanical description is fully adequate. This shows the importance of non-
relativistic QM, even though, in principle, a strictly correct treatment should imple-
ment relativity as well. The basic constituents of matter are atoms whose building
blocks in turn are nuclei and electrons. These last control the properties of mat-
ter such as chemical bonds and conductivity. Since electrons are spin-1/2 fermions,
the non-relativistic wave equation describing them, namely the Pauli equation, has a
somewhat distinguished position in our understanding of the matter surrounding us.
But whereas in most books on QM a considerable eﬀort is spent on the interpretation
of the Schr¨odinger equation (i.e. the spin-0 wave equation) in terms of the probability
density ρ and the current j, a corresponding discussion of the spin-1/2 case (the Pauli
equation) is rarely to be found [1]. This might have to do with the tacit assumption
that the construction of the spin-1/2 current goes along the same line of arguments as
in the spin-0 case. Hence one might conclude that, apart from a trivial replacement
of ‘complex-conjugate’ by ‘hermitian-conjugate’, there is conceptually nothing new in
the current of the Pauli equation. This, as will be shown below, is misleading. Indeed,
in constructing the current for spin-1/2 case one can copy all the steps known from
the Schr¨odinger case to obtain an expression for j. However, due to the presence of
the spin this construction is ambiguous, i.e. there exist terms which can be added
to j and which do not emerge from the above mentioned construction. They can
be added since they do not spoil the continuity equation, they are of ﬁrst order in
the derivative and second order of the wave function which means that they are of
‘velocity-type’ as are the rest of the conventional terms known from the spin-0 case.
This ambiguity cannot be resolved by means of non-relativistic QM alone. Or, to put
it diﬀerently, this ambiguity only appears from the point of view of non-relativistic
QM. However, the current must be ﬁxed uniquely as it is an observable.

It is clear that something new is required to solve the problem in a satisfac-
tory way. As it is often the case in physics a new symmetry imposed on the system
restricts the number of possible terms and can therefore resolve an otherwise persis-
tent ambiguity. The symmetry we have in mind here, is the Lorentz symmetry. A
relativistic wave equation for spin-1/2 particles is the Dirac equation which has a pos-
itive deﬁnite probability density and a continuity equation [2]. The non-relativistic
reduction of the Dirac equation and of the corresponding current will then answer the
problem unambiguously. From a pedagogical point of view it seems even desirable
to postpone the discussion of the Pauli current until relativistic QM is introduced.
Unfortunately, the main stream of interest diverges here and from relativistic QM one
usually proceeds to relativistic Quantum Field Theory. Hence it seems that there is a
problem which most of the books on non-relativistic QM do not mention. Considering
the importance of the current in interpreting QM, it seems that it is worthwhile to
ﬁll this gap.

To make the problem concrete, let us start with the Pauli equation for an

where ψ is a two component spinor. We have set ¯h = c = 1. Although mostly we will
be concerned with electromagnetic interactions, the point we are making (namely
the correct form of the current) is in fact independent of the detailed form of the
interaction. We will comment on this later in the text. The probability density

Extending the standard prescription for construction of j from the Schr¨odinger case

This expression is gauge invariant (thanks to the Aρ term) and could be, in principle,
a good candidate for the complete quantum mechanical current of spin-1/2 fermions
if we could make it plausible that (4) is in some sense unique. This is, however, not
the case. We can trivially add to j′ a gauge invariant term proportional to

∇×(ψ†σψ)

without changing the continuity equation (3). Note that in the Schr¨odinger case it is
not possible to construct a ‘curl-term’ which is ﬁrst order in the derivative and second
order in the wave functions.

Hence there is a priori no way to decide (not only for the electromagnetic
interaction), from the point of view of non-relativistic QM, whether a term like in
eq.(5) should be added to j′ or not (and if yes what is the proportionality factor).
Since the current is a physical observable, this apparent ambiguity must have a unique
resolution. Indeed, as will be evident below, there is no such ambiguity in the full
physical theory as we can ﬁx the current uniquely by using relativistic arguments.
Note also that once this question is settled, the electric current has to be J = ej.

One could of course argue that only ‘orbital-terms’ like ψ†∇ψ should enter
in j and hence also in J . This has a classical ﬂavour and cannot be regarded as a
compelling argument. The correct approach should use a non-relativistic reduction

of both, the relativistic wave equation and its current and we will see below that the
above naive argument does not hold.

Before performing the non-relativistic reduction for the Dirac equation let us
emphasize here two points. Relativistic QM including external ﬁelds is well-deﬁned
below the particle anti-particle production threshold which implies that the external
ﬁelds should not be too strong. This is to stress the correctness of the relativistic
external ﬁeld problem. While historically one of the ﬁrst checks of any relativistic
theory has been to test that it yielded the standard non-relativistic limit, by now
the relativistic theory, and in particular here the Dirac equation, is well-established.
Thus when there is a non-relativistic ambiguity such as we have seen above, we may
safely use the relativistic Dirac theory to ﬁnd the correct non-relativistic limit.

Inserting this in (6) we obtain the Pauli equation (1) for the spinor ψ. A similar

where j ′ has been already deﬁned in (4). Equation (9) is the correct non-relativistic
spin-1/2 current of the Pauli equation. The question about the ambiguity of the Pauli
current posed at the beginning has been completely answered.

We see that the correct electric current to be used, say, in addressing ques-
tions about conductivity indeed contains a ‘spin-term’ of the form (5) as well as the
usual ‘orbital-terms’ j′. Some comments are in order here. First note that whereas
j′ depends explicitly on the interaction (potential) used in the Pauli equation (1),
the ‘spin-term’ (1/2m)∇×(ψ†σψ) does not. This is clear from eq. (4) where the
vector potential enters explicitly. Had we used an interaction other than the elec-
tromagnetic one, j′ could then still be constructed as in the Schr¨odinger case, but

the ‘spin-term’ would then follow from a corresponding non-relativistic reduction of
the Dirac equation (coupled to this interaction) and its current. In other words this
term will always be present, regardless of the interaction, and indeed even in the
interaction-free case (it is even an easier excercise to perform the non-relativistic re-
duction for free electrons). From the above it follows that while j′ is closely related
to the detailed form of the Pauli equation, the ‘spin-term’ is not. That is why from
the point of view of non-relativistic quantum mechanics there seems to be an ambi-
guity. It seems that, in general, the non-relativistic result contains less information
when viewed independently from its relativistic ‘parent’. This is not surprising as
imposing a symmetry, here the Lorentz symmetry, limits the number of choices and
can therefore ‘seal the fate’ of a possible structure of a term. In the case of electro-
magnetic interactions we can relate the ’spin-term’ to the (e/2m)σ
B term in the
Hamiltonian of the Pauli equation, provided we are allowed to use some arguments

Inserting here the ‘spin-term’ of the current (9) we recover, after partial integration,
the (e/2m)σ
B term of the Hamiltonian (we assume here B to be constant and
the wave-packets localized). Note that this argument, in the case of electromagnetic
interactions, would link the Pauli equation with the full current (9) and produce the
correct result seemingly without the non-relativistic reduction. However, there are
several drawbacks to it. For instance, we should not mix (quantum) ﬁeld theory with
‘point-particle’ (quantum) physics. Indeed, in the latter the current is a functional
of the wave function which in turn is the solution of the Pauli equation. A ‘conﬁr-
mation’ of the Hamiltonian via the ﬁeld theory method can thus be understood as
a useful heuristic argument. As mentioned above, the presence of the ‘spin-term’ in
(9) is also independent of the form of interaction we use. But the argument given
above is limited to the electromagnetic interaction. It can, however, always be used
heuristically to check the correctness of (9).

To show the relevance of the ‘new’ term in eq. (9) explicitly, let us solve the
Pauli equation (1) for an electron in an uniform magnetic ﬁeld B (pointing in the
positive z-direction) and an uniform electric ﬁeld E (in the negative x-direction, say).
The electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is then like that of the Hall eﬀect [4]. We are
considering here the case of one electron in the presence of electromagnetic ﬁelds,
but in vacuum otherwise. This is then unlike the Hall eﬀect where the electrons
are moving in solids (to avoid confusion, we are not suggesting here a new way to

vanishes. The ﬁrst term, viz. eρnE
, corresponds in this form to the classical result
(see e.g.
[4]). In the ground state therefore, the classical and quantum mechanical
results coincide. For higher excited states there is, however, a new contribution to
Jy (proportional to 2ne/m) which is of purely quantum mechanical origin and which
can be traced back to the ‘spin-term’ in eq.(5). As already stated, we have not tried
to solve here the Quantum Hall eﬀect [5]. Our main motivation was to point out the
relevance of the ‘spin-term’ to the (electric) current. It would clearly be interesting
to study the eﬀects of the extra term in the current in various physical applications.

We feel it is reasonable to speculate that this term might play a role in problems
concerning conductivity in solids. Finally, we recall that the proof of the need for
such a term in the non-relativistic current was decided essentially by relativistic QM.
This is one of the few places where relativistic QM can resolve a problem of the non-
relativistic theory. We think that text books on non-relativistic QM should include
at least a note on the diﬀerent (as compared to the Schr¨odinger case) nature of
the quantum mechanical Pauli current in order not to give the impression that in
constructing the Pauli current it suﬃces to copy the steps from the Schr¨odinger case.
The quantum mechanical current is not only important for the correct interpretation

subject, one can point out the power of symmetry arguments which limits our choice
of possible terms. Since the appearance of the ambiguity (from the non-relativistic
point of view) in the Pauli current is physically not acceptable (the current is an
observable), this hints towards the need of a more general theory which includes
relativity. In spite of the fact that in practical calculations concerning properties of
solids relativity does not play a big part, it plays a role, as shown above, on a more
fundamental level. This is then also a lesson on the unity of physics.

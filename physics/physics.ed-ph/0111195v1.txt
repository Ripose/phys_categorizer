Abstract

We solve a diﬃcult problem involving velocity and acceleration
components along oblique axes, and propose two problems of cen-
tral force motion to be solved using oblique axes.

1 Introduction

2

Any vector quantity can be resolved into components according to the par-
allelogram law, both by rectangular and oblique resolution.
In rectangular coordinates, one component is perpendicular to the other. In
oblique coordinates, one component has a projection on the other. We have
to take this projection into account when ﬁnding velocity and acceleration
components along these axes.
Because of this, problems involving oblique axes are very diﬃcult. However,
once one realizes that a problem requires oblique axes, the solution is not in
general that hard, although the derivation of the kinematics on oblique axes
is somewhat disgusting.

2 The velocity components

Consider the motion of a particle in a plane. Suppose that the geometry of the
motion is such that the velocity of the particle is more conveniently referred
to two oblique axes Oξ and Oη which make angles φ and ψ respectively with
a ﬁxed direction Ox in the plane, as shown in Fig. 1. Theses angles may
vary arbitrarily with time as the particle moves.
Suppose that at the time t the components of the velocity in the directions
Oξ and Oη are u and v, respectively. The perpendicular projections of these
components along Oξ and Oη are, respectively,

u + v cos(ψ − φ)

and

v + u cos(ψ − φ),

(2.1)

as shown in the ﬁgure for the projection on the Oξ axis only.

At the time t + ∆t the axes Oξ and Oη take the positions ξ and η, as shown
in Fig. 2, with ξOξ = ∆φ and ηOη = ∆ψ.
Let the components of the velocity along these axes at this time be u + ∆u
and v + ∆v. The perpendicular projections of these components along the
axes Oξ and Oη are, respectively,

(u + ∆u) cos ∆φ + (v + ∆v) cos(ψ − φ + ∆ψ)

and

(v + ∆v) cos ∆ψ + (u + ∆u) cos(ψ − φ − ∆φ).

By taking the diﬀerence between the projections (2.2) and (2.1) of the ve-
locities along the axes Oξ and Oη at the corresponding times t + ∆t and t,
dividing the result by ∆t, and letting ∆t go to zero, we obtain the projections
of the acceleration along those axes at the time t:

and

˙u + ˙v cos(ψ − φ) − v ˙ψ sin(ψ − φ)

˙v + ˙u cos(ψ − φ) + u ˙φ sin(ψ − φ),

(2.3)

(2.4)

where ˙u is the limiting value of ∆u/∆t, when ∆t approaches zero.

3 The acceleration components

Now let aξ and aη represent the components of the acceleration of the particle
along Oξ and Oη at the time t. The same relationship (2.1) for velocities
hold for accelerations. Thus, the perpendicular projections of the components

along the axes Oξ and Oη are

aξ + aη cos(ψ − φ)

and

aη + aξ cos(ψ − φ).

(3.5)

On equating (2.2) and (3.5) we obtain

aξ + aη cos(ψ − φ) = ˙u + ˙v cos(ψ − φ) − v ˙ψ sin(ψ − φ)

and

aη + aξ cos(ψ − φ) = ˙v + ˙u cos(ψ − φ) + u ˙φ sin(ψ − φ),

(3.6)

from which we can solve for aξ and aη.

The ﬁrst two terms in equations (3.6) are the rates of change of the projec-
tions (2.1) along ﬁxed axes. The last terms are the consequence of the motion
of the axes themselves. (Reference [2] suggests an alternative approach to
obtaining these equations.)

4 A diﬃcult problem

As an illustration, consider the following mind boggling problem [3]:

A circle, a straight line, and a point lie in one plane, and the position of
the point is determined by the lengths τ of its tangent to the circle and p of
its perpendicular to the line. Prove that, if the velocity of the point in made
up of components u, v in the directions of these lengths, and if their mutual
inclination is θ, the component accelerations will be

˙u −

cos θ,

˙v +

.

Solution. Take the axis Oξ to be the tangent to the circle, and Oη
to be the axis perpendicular to the line. Set θ = ψ − φ and note that
ψ does not vary with time. It is then easy to check that equations (3.6),
with due change in notation, reduce to the following set of equations

at + ap cos θ = ˙u + ˙v cos θ

Figure 4: The geometry of the illustrative problem. The particle moves from
the point O to the point P . Its position is determined by the tangent line to
the circle and also by a perpendicular to a given line in the plane. The tangent
lines at two diﬀerent times meet at Q and make an angle ∆φ.

ap + at cos θ = ˙v + ˙u cos θ + u ˙φ sin θ.

If we solve (4.7) for at and ap we obtain

at = ˙u −

and

To eliminate the variable ˙φ we need to consider the (messy) geometry
of the problem. Let the two tangent lines to the circle, drawn from the
two positions of the particle at O and P , meet at a point Q, as shown
in Fig. 4. Note that the lines OQ and P Q form an angle ∆φ with
each other at Q. Next, draw from the point P a perpendicular to the
given line. Let this perpendicular meet the line OQ at a point R. The
perpendicular P R makes an angle ψ − φ with OQ. For small ∆t, P is
near O, and we have, approximately, P Q = τ and P R = v∆t. The law

of sines, applied to the triangle P QR, gives

or

Substituting ˙φ given above in (4.8), we obtain the desired result.

4.1 Further examples

The equations for velocity and acceleration components on oblique axes can
be used to provide solution to problems of motion in a central force ﬁeld
when these problems are phrased as follows.

1. A particle P moves in a plane in such a way that its velocity has two
constant components u and v, with u parallel to a ﬁxed direction in
the plane while v is normal to a straight line from the particle to a
ﬁxed point O in the plane. Show that the acceleration of the particle is
directed along the line OP . (In fact, the particle moves in a ellipse of
eccentricity u/v, having O as a focus.)

2. A boat crosses a river with velocity of constant magnitude u always
aimed toward a point S on the opposite shore directly across its starting
position. The rivers also runs with uniform velocity u. Compare this
problem with the preceding one. (How far downstream from S does the
boat reach the opposite shore?)

A structural study of the smaller Li+Hen clusters with n

30 has been carried out using different theo-

retical methods. The structures and the energetics of the clusters have been obtained using both classical

energy minimization methods and quantum Diffusion Monte Carlo. The total interaction acting within the

clusters has been obtained as a sum of pairwise potentials: Li+-He and He-He. This approximation had

been shown in our earlier study [1] to give substantially correct results for energies and geometries once

compared to full ab-initio calculations. The general features of the spatial structures, and their energetics,

are discussed in details for the clusters up to n = 30 and the ﬁrst solvation shell is shown to be essentially

completed by the ﬁrst ten helium atoms.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the nanoscopic forces which act within small aggregates of weakly interacting par-

ticles, especially within assemblies containing helium atoms, has received a great deal of attention

in the last few years [2, 3, 4] because of the broad range of phenomena that can be probed under

the very special conditions provided by the He nanodroplets as containers of atoms or molecules.

They are indeed, ultracold homogeneous matrices where the corresponding spectra often reach

very high resolution due to the superﬂuid properties of the helium droplet [5].

The possibility of causing electronic excitation and/or ionization of the dopant species can

offer additional ways of probing the modiﬁed interaction between the new ionic species and the

gentle matrix of the helium droplets [4] since the ensuing distribution surrounding the molecular

impurity is usually markedly deformed as a consequence of the electrostriction effects on the

solvent brought on by the induction forces between the charged dopant and the helium atoms in

the droplet [6, 7]. The analysis of such effects in the case of lithium-containing impurities has been

particularly intriguing because of the expected simplicity of the electronic structures involved and,

at the same time, the unusual bonding behaviour of such systems. Furthermore, experiments in

which the droplet was ionized after capture of Li atoms [8] have revealed a wealth of newly formed
species like Li+, Li+
2 and LiHe+ which are produced during droplet fragmentation and evaporation
thereby triggering the corresponding analysis of structure and bonding behaviour from theory and

computations.

In a previous computational investigation [1] on the interaction of Li+ with n helium atoms,

with n varying from 1 to 6, we have shown, in fact, that the energy optimized structures of the

clusters were largely determined by two-body (2B) forces, with the many-body effects being fairly

negligible for determining the ﬁnal geometry of those small aggregates. In the present study we

have therefore decided to analyze in greater detail the quantum states and binding energies of the

larger structures of Li+ impurities within the helium droplets in order to extend our computational

knowledge on such species.

The next Section brieﬂy describes the LiHe+ Potential Energy Curve (PEC) used here. The

results for the trimer ground state are given and discussed in Section III, where we report the

features obtained using the distributed Gaussian functions (DGF) method [9, 10, 11, 12] and the

quantum Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method [13], in comparison with the values obtained via

a classical minimization procedure. Section IV extends the discussion to the larger species, whose

2

energetics and structural features, both obtained with DMC and classical methods, are analyzed.

II. THE PAIRWISE POTENTIALS

The actual potential energy curve (PEC) for Li+He has been studied before because of its

interest in modeling low-energy plasmas [14]. Alrich and coworkers suggested earlier on a model

potential as a variant of the Tang-Toennies model [15] while recent calculations of Sold´an et al.

[16] employed a CCSD(T) treatment and used the aug-cc-pV5Z basis set. Recently, we have also

carried out a new set of calculations on these clusters [1] using the MP4 method and the cc-pV-5Z

basis set. The results from the ab initio calculation of Ref. [16], the potential obtained from a

MP4/cc-pV-5Z calculation and the model potential of Ref. [15] are presented in pictorial form by

the two panels of Fig. 1 where in the left panel we show the region of the potential minimum. One

clearly sees there that the deepest well is presented by the CCSD(T) calculations of [16], while the

model potential of [15] has the most shallow well. The corresponding long-range part of the PEC’s

is reported on the right-hand side panel, where one can see that the calculations of [16] closely
follow the long-range dipole polarisability tail, computed here with a He=1.3832 a3
0 [17]. In Table
1 we report the bound states of the Li+-He diatom when J = 0 for the three different potentials

calculated using a DVR scheme [18] using 2000 grid points in the interval 1.5, 200 a.u.. In the

case of the potential of Murrel et al. [16] our results are almost coincident with those provided by

the same authors. As can be seen there, the three potentials yield rather similar energies, although

in the well region the agreement is better between those from the MP4 potential and those from

Soldan et al.. On the other hand, the latter has a long range behavior very similar to that from

the semi-empirical ATT potential (see also Fig. 1 where we compare it to the “experimental”

long range behavior): both these potentials, indeed, support 8 bound states while the potential

calculated by us with MP4 [1] yields only 7 bound states for J = 0. The MP4 potential therefore

seems not to provide a good description of the long range, inductive tail because of the lack of

augmented atomic functions in the basis set from which it has been obtained. Hence, we have

decided to employ in the following the CCSD(T) PEC from Soldan et al..

For the He2 dimer we have employed the semiempirical potential (LM2M2) of Aziz and Slaman

[19]: in Fig. 2 we sketch the two pair potentials used in our calculations. The two potentials are

completely different: the Li+-He one is dominated by electrostatic and induction forces while the

He-He interaction is much weaker and purely van der Waals in nature.

3

As we mentioned above, the full interaction that acts in the M+Rgn clusters can be approx-

imated by a sum of pairwise potentials. The main source of error in this model is due to the

absence of the repulsive interactions between the induced dipoles on the helium atoms, especially

those that are located near the ionic center. These interactions, however, can be taken to be very

small for rare gas atoms and especially for helium partners. For example, in Ref. [20] for the anal-

ogous situation of the anionic dopant Cl− in Ar clusters it has been shown that the inclusion of the

leading terms of such 3-body forces does not alter substantially the energetics and the structure of

the clusters: in ref. [1] we have discussed and conﬁrmed this feature for the system analyzed here.
Furthermore, since the charge delocalization in Li+-Hen is very small [21] and the interaction is

mostly determined by ¨physical¨ forces (charge/induced multipole) rather than by ¨chemical¨ ef-

fects, all the helium atoms that are attached directly to the ionic center can be considered to be

equivalent because there is no detectable tendency for the latter to preferentially form chemically

bound structures with only a subset of such adatoms, a fact which would therefore differentiate

some of the binding effects with respect to those in the rest of the cluster.

III. AN OUTLINE OF THE COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS

A. The classical optimization

The total potential in each cluster is described by the sum of pairwise potentials and searching

for the global minimum in this hypersurface VTOT will give us the lowest energy structure for each

aggregate from a classical picture viewpoint. All the classical minimizations were carried out with

a modiﬁed version of the OPTIM code by Wales [22]. This code is based on the eigenvector fol-

lowing method. The basis of this method is the introduction of an additional Lagrange parameter

into a “traditional” optimization framework [23], which seeks to simultaneously minimize in all

directions. All searches were conducted in Cartesian coordinates using projection operators to

remove overall translation and rotation following Baker and Hehre [24]. Analytic ﬁrst and second

derivatives of the energy were employed at every step, and the resulting stationary point energies

and geometries are essentially exact for the model potential in question. The details of the method

as applied in our group have been given before and therefore will not be repeated here.

4

B. The quantum stochastic calculation (DMC)

The Diffusion MonteCarlo Method has been extensively discussed in a number of papers (Refs.

[25, 26, 27] and references therein) and therefore will not be repeated here.

In our implementation a random walk technique is used to solve the diffusion equation where
t starting from an arbitrarily

a large number of random walkers is propagated with time steps D

chosen initial distribution. The ground state energy E0 is obtained by averaging EL(r) over the
ﬁnal mixed distributions f (r,t) = y T (r,t)y (r,t):

< EL >=

f (r, t f )dr

=

y 0(r) ˆHy T (r)dr
y 0(r)y T (r)dr

= E0

R

The energy is therefore affected by a bias due to the use of a mixed distribution. The bias is

however minimized by using very long propagation time and very short timesteps. Expectation
values of position operators ˆA(r) are also given by averaging over f (r), a procedure that leads to

biased distributions. However, we believe that the bias does not modify the qualitative picture of

the present calculations especially because whenever our spatial distributions are compared with

those from other quantum calculations (where possible) and with classically minimized structures,

they are found to be in remarkable agreement with each other as we shall discuss further below.

He pair has been chosen as a gaussian function centered around the energy minimum of

the relative interaction. However, in order to adjust each trial wavefunction to the size of the

larger clusters, its parameters have been chosen so that they make it increasingly more delocalized

as the number of adatoms is increased. All prameters are available from direct requests to the

corresponding author.

C. The distributed Gaussian Functions (DGF) expansion

The DGF method [9, 10] is a variational approach which solves the trimer bound state problem

written in terms of the atom-atom coordinates by employing a large set of distributed Gaussian

functions as a basis set.

5

First of all, the Hamiltonian for a triatomic system is expressed in terms of atom pair coordi-

nates R1, R2 and R3, i.e. in terms of the distances between each pair of atoms along which the

Gaussian functions are distributed (see [11] for the expression of the Hamiltonian for a triatomic

system with an impurity).

The total potential for the trimer is assumed to be the sum of the three two-Body potentials as

discussed previously and the calculations are carried out for a zero total angular momentum. The

total wavefunction for the v-th vibrational states is then expanded in terms of symmetrized basis

functions

With the DGF approach we can obtain several indicators on the spatial behaviour of the bound

the various moments - of any angle etc.), along with several probability distribution functions like

The selection of a suitable set of Gaussian functions and their distribution within the physical

space where the bound states are located is obviously of primary importance in order to ﬁnally

obtain converged and stable results. We extensively experimented with different sets obtained

by changing the number and location of the DGF depending on the features of the 2B potentials

employed. The details of the basis set employed for the title system are speciﬁcally given in the

following section.

IV. THE Li+He2 TRIMER

Together with the classical optimization and the DMC calculations, we further carried out the
analysis of the properties of the trimer Li+He2 using the DGF method. We employed an optimized

DGF basis set in order to obtain well-behaving total wave functions at the triangle inequality

boundaries (for further details see Ref. [33]). The Gaussian functions are distributed equidistantly

along the atom-atom coordinates starting from 2.55 a0 and out to 9.18 a0 with a step of 0.17 a0,
1 (0.01 % of the total ground state

a choice which ensures converged results within about 0.1 cm−

energy). In Table II we report the results obtained with DMC and DGF methods: they are seen to

be in good agreement with each other. Due to the addition of the second light He atom, the Zero

Point Energy (ZPE) of the trimer is slightly higher than the ZPE of the isolated dimer ion (see

Table I). However, the two ZPE values are very similar in percentage values, showing that the Li+

impurity strongly affects the features of the cluster, as expected from the involved potentials while

the additional helium atom has little effect on the bonding features. The ionic system, as expected,

does not present the typical high degree of delocalization shown in pure He clusters (the ZPE for

He3 is more than 99 % of its total well depth [34]), or by doped He aggregates with weakly bound

impurities as, e.g., H−, for which the impurity is clearly located outside the cluster (the ZPE for
H−He2 is 90.66 % [35]). Hence, we expect the Li+-He2 trimer (and its larger clusters) to behave
in a different way with respect to the more weakly bound neutral He clusters and thus presume that

the classical description of the ionic structures should give us realistic indications on the structure

and energetics of such systems (as it was the case in, e.g., the H−Arn clusters that we studied

earlier [36]).

We therefore begin by looking at the average values of the radial distances and angles (see Ta-

ble II) which, together with the corresponding standard deviations, describe the ground state of the

trimer and clearly conﬁrm its having a rather ﬂoppy structure: on the other hand, the Li+ species

still is undoubtedly seen by our calculations to coordinate the two He atoms at a distance deter-

mined within 0.3 a0. Information on the overall geometrical features of the trimer is further gained

from the radial and angular distributions shown in Fig. 3, where the values obtained with the

classical optimization are also reported as vertical lines. DMC and DGF results are substantially

concident and the small differences are mainly due to the bias contained in our DMC distributions.

We notice that the ﬂoppiness of the system is particularly evident when looking at the distribution

function related to the He-He distance, whose standard deviation is more than twice larger than

7

the one for the Li+-He bonds. The classical values obtained in the structure optimization are also

closer to the quantum average values obtained for the Li+-He distances.

In the classical description we do ﬁnd that the ground state of the trimer is depicted by an

isosceles triangle, with the two shorter sides associated to the two Li+-He distances and a longer

one corresponding to the He-He distance. On the other hand, the real quantum system cannot be

described by one single structure only, and its distribution functions correctly show a delocalized

triatom with a dominant contribution from the collinear arrangement. The image of a structure

with the Li+ coordinating the two He atoms at a rather well deﬁned distance (notice the compact

distribution function related to Li+-He distances) is not completely lost in the quantum description,

meaning that the presence of the strong ionic forces from Li+ is reducing the degree of delocal-

ization which is always present in the pure He aggregates. This change determines the more rigid

structure of the system in the sense that now the He atoms are more strongly coordinated directly

to the Li+ impurity (see next section on the larger clusters).

We carried out an additional analysis of the structural features of the trimer by taking advantage

of the DGF pseudo-weights [9], which allow us to pictorially describe the trimer in terms of types

of triangular arrangements. In the upper panel of Fig. 4 we thus report all the employed basis set

functions, grouped according to the triangular family to which they belong, and in the lower panel

of the same ﬁgure we report the ‘weight’ of the dominant families when describing the ground state

of the trimer. We can thus easily identify the most important arrangement to be given by the ‘ﬂat’

isosceles, the collinear (with the the impurity in the middle) and the scalene triangles, while all

other possibilities do not contribute in a signiﬁcant way. Again, we ﬁnd that we cannot associate

the system to one unique structure. while the marked delocalization features are now mainly

related to the He-He binding and less to the Li+-He ionic forces; hence we see that a conventional

structure with the Li+ coordinating the two He atoms can still be qualitatively identiﬁed. In the

next section we shall further discuss how the situation evolves with the addition of more He atoms

and to which extent the classical results can be still seen to qualitatively correspond to the quantum

description of their structures surrounding the ionic dopant.

AND CLASSICAL CALCULATIONS

We start now to discuss the energetics and the geometrical features of the larger Li+Hen clusters

with n

3. Up to n = 10, infact, it was still possible to also carry out quantum DMC calculations

≥

which are not too demanding in terms of CPU-time. Hence, for clusters of such a size we can

make a direct comparison between our quantum ﬁndings and the classical optimization results

we obtained via the combination of the OPTIM procedure [37] with a random search for the

minimum energy structures (see for details refs. [36, 38]). In Table III we report the results for the

energetics. The left part of that table shows the minimum potential energies obtained by means

of the classical optimizations (column labeled ’classical’) in comparison with the corresponding

DMC ground state energies (column labelled ’quantum’). The differences between the two sets

of values are due to the ZPE effects of the nuclear motions: in the third column we also display

the ZPE value for each cluster as a percentage of the well depth. The amount of the ZPE effects

increases as the cluster grows, since the incresing addition of He atoms brings the ZPE percentage
from about 20% for Li+He2 to more than 40% for the last cluster studied here with the quantum
DMC method (Li+He20). On the right part of Table III we report the total energies relative to the
loss of one He atom between the pairs of Li+Hen and Li+Hen
−

1 clusters, calculated both with the

classical and quantum methods. We notice that the evaporation energy is drastically reduced when

passing from the cluster with n=6 to that with n=7 and correspondingly the ZPE percentage value

increases most markedly (more than 3%). We can then surmise that the structure with n=6 is a

particularly stable cluster as we shall further discuss below.

The data presented in Table III are pictorially reported in the two panels of Fig. 5 where the

energies are plotted as functions of the number n of He atoms in each cluster. From the lower
panel of Fig. 5 we can see the similar behaviour shown by the D Eev values up to n = 6 while for

n

up to n = 30 (DMC results up to n = 20): again the two curves show very similar behaviour, both

presenting the same abrupt energy drop at n = 7 and n = 9. In contrast with what we found in

our analysis of H−Hen clusters [35], the step-like structure shown by the classical treatment is

now also present in the quantum calculations. Given such a correspondence between the classical

9

and quantum description for these smaller clusters it then becomes reasonable to try to explain the

sudden energy jumps of Fig. 5 by looking at the lowest energy structures found with the classical

minimizations (see Fig. 6). In that ﬁgure we also report the corresponding symmetry groups, the
1), and the relevant distances between atoms (in a.u.). We therefore see that
total energy (in cm−
the Li+He6 has the very symmetrical octahedral geometry (see second panel in the upper part of
the ﬁgure) where all the He atoms are equivalently coordinated to the central Li+ at a distance very
close to the Req (3.58 a0) of the Li+He PEC. On the other hand, when moving to the Li+He7, the

repulsive forces acting between the rare gas species do not allow any more for such a symmetrical

arrangement around the Li+ ion and the net effect is that of decreasing the energy contributions

from the interactions between each He atom and the positive ion, i.e. the Li+He distance becomes

larger, as one can see in Fig. 6 from the reported RLiHe values. Similar reasoning can be applied

to explain the second energy step between n = 8 and n = 9:

the evaporation energy gives the

mean value of the energy necessary to remove any of the He atoms and the presence of a non-
equivalent rare gas atom in the apical position in Li+He9 (see second panel in the lower part of

Fig. 6) causes a signiﬁcant decrease of the evaporation energy with respect to its value for the
Li+He8 cluster. Finally, for Li+He10 the lowest energy structure we obtained with the classical

minimization corresponds to the symmetrical bicapped square antiprism geometry. Hence, by

using the classical geometries and energy minimization procedures, we found three relatively more

stable structures for clusters with n=6,8 and 10, in correspondence with symmetrically compact

structures. However, we cannot associate the closing of a solvating ‘shell’ to the clusters with

n=6 and n=8 because they do not constitute as yet a possible core around which the larger clusters

grow.

The correspondence between classical and quantum structural pictures is clearly well repro-

duced if we now compare the quantum distribution functions with the classical results for the

the Li+

relative distances and angles. In Fig. 7 we report the DMC atom-atom distribution functions for
He distances within each Li+Hen cluster, normalized to the total num-
ber n of possible ’connections’ between Li+ and He atoms (solid lines) and to the total number

He and He

−

−

N = n(n

1)/2 possible ’connections’ between the n He atoms (dashed lines). In this way we

−

can make a direct comparison between the quantum calculations and the lowest energy geomet-

rical structures obtained with the classical optimizations where the conventional picture of direct

bonds existing between localized, point-like, partners can be used. In that ﬁgure we also report

the classically optimized distances: we have grouped together sets of close values and have given

10

as horizontal bars their statistical standard deviations: each set has a height proportional to the

number of distances which have the same value. Finally, the displayed numbers are the values

of the integration along r for each broad peak in the quantum distribution functions and represent

the number of bonds within atoms which are in the given distance range under each integration.

In Fig. 7 we report the results for four selected clusters (n = 4, 6, 7, 10) which we shall use in

our discussion: we also obtained similar results for all the other clusters. When we look at the
panel showing the Li+He4 clusters in the upper left of Figure 7, we see that the DMC distribution
function for the Li+

He distance peaks at 3.88 a.u. while the classical distances are represented

−

by one ’stick’ at 3.59 a.u. whose height is 4, equal to the value of the area under the quantum

distribution (solid line); we see also that the DMC distribution function for the He

He distance

−

peaks at 6.13 a.u. while the classical distances are represented by one ’stick’ at 5.85 a.u. whose

height is 6 (which is the value of N = n(n

1)/2, with n = 4) a number which is indeed equal

−

to the value of the area under the quantum distribution (dashed line). For the larger clusters (see

the other panels of the same ﬁgure) the number of distinct sets of distances increases, but still

the agreement between classical and quantum ﬁndings concerning the number of corresponding

distances remains very good. Although the mean values are different as a consequence of the very

diffuse behaviour of the wavefunctions in such weak interatomic potentials, we can clearly see that

the classical results essentially provide the same qualitative structural picture. In order to compare

even more in detail the classical and quantum results, we report in Fig 8 the DMC angular distri-
bution functions P(q ) for the angles centered at the Li+ ion and at any of the He atoms together

with the results from classical optimization: we see again that the agreement between quantum

and classical values (vertical lines) indeed remains very close, at least at the qualitative level.

These ﬁndings allow us to make further comments on the microsolvation process that occurs

when the Li+ is inserted in a small He cluster. Both the classical and the quantum treatments
concur in locating the Li+ impurity inside the Hen moiety as one can clearly see from Figure 9
where we report the DMC distribution functions P(r) of the Li+ (solid lines) and of the He atoms
(dashed lines) from the geometrical center of each Li+Hen cluster. This quantity is deﬁned as:

(7)

where N runs over the total number of atoms in the cluster. The Li+ is always closer to the geo-

metrical center with respect to the He atoms, and when the cluster size increases the corresponding

distribution functions have reduced overlap, thereby showing that the cluster growth is accompa-

nied by the slow “dropping” of the Li+ towards the geometrical center of the latter

Finally, we carried out classical optimizations for

larger clusters Li+Hen (n=11-15,

18,20,22,26,30) in order to better conﬁrm what we have observed in the smaller ones; the low-

est energy geometries for a selection of them are reported in Fig. 10. For all the clusters under
inspection, the growth occurs around the highly symmetric Li+He10 core represented by the bi-
capped square antiprism polyhedron enclosing the Li+ impurity and drawn with thicker lines in

the ﬁgure. The additional He atoms are now being placed further away from the impurity without
perturbing the structure of the Li+He10 moiety which therefore seems to constitute the ﬁrst solva-

tion shell of the atomic ion. We expect that the He atoms outside the shell will be characterized by

a greater delocalization and weaker interactions with the central Li+ that the less shielded inner

core of ten atoms. From now on we expect, therefore, that the cluster will grow by adding more

solvent atoms in a nearly isotropic fashion driven mainly by He-He interaction and we surmise that

the binding energies of each atom will become increasingly similar to those of a pure He cluster.

Correspondingly, the evaporation energy (see Fig. 6) now shows a markedly different behaviour

with respect to what happens in the smaller clusters with n

10: the step-like feature disappears,

≤

to be substituted by a plateau giving us the average energy needed to remove one of the nearly

equivalent external He atoms.

This expected result is also shown by the quantum calculations (see Figure 5, lower panel) and

is also borne out by the corresponding quantum distributions of the helium adatoms given by the
data of Figure 11, where our DMC calculations for the Li+(He)20 clusters are reported: one clearly
see there that the radial distributions associated with the He distances from the Li+ moiety show a

set of more compact values related to the ﬁrst shell of about 10 adatoms and a further distribution

at larger distances (and broader than the ﬁrst one) associated with the outer atoms that are chieﬂy

bound by dispersion and by strongly screened induction interactions.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In the present work we have analized the solvation process of a Li+ ion in pure bosonic Helium

clusters in order to extend to a larger number of atoms the studies we had already carried out in

previous work on the smaller aggregates [1]. Here a combination of classical energy minimization

techniques and of “exact” quantum Monte Carlo methods have been employed in order to describe
the structure and the energetics of the Li+(He)n clusters with n up to 30 (20 for DMC calculations),

12

employing always a description based on the sum-of-potential approximation.

The basic approximation which this study relies on is that of calculating the full cluster inter-

action as a sum of pairwise potentials. Although the error introduced by this assumption is in

general found to be (in absolute terms) larger in ionic systems than in neutral ones, its relative

weight remains rather small [1]. Thus, we believe that the resulting stuctures and energies would

not be substantially altered by the correct use of a full Many-Body potential (see for example, the

discussion in Ref. [20] for the similar situations of H− and Cl− in Rg clusters and our calculations

in Ref. [1]).

We have therefore shown that:

on very small aggregates [1];

1. the Li+ is fully solvated inside larger 4He clusters as already indicated by our earlier work

2. the ionic Li+ core does not form preferential “molecular cores” with surrounding He atoms

but rather that the helium adatoms remain equivalently bound within each solvation shell to

the central, solvated lithium ion that persists in carrying the positive charge for more than

98% [1].

3. the ZPE corrections play a role in such systems, albeit strongly reduced with respect to the

one found in neutral aggregates: this means that, at least in the initial solvation shell, the

quantum adatoms are less delocalized and that the lithium-helium direct “bonds” are nearly

rigid, classical structures;

4. the classical optimization procedures can provide structural details which are reasonably

close to those given by the quantum DMC calculations and can yield for ionic moieties the

same structural picture as that given by the quantum treatment.

Furthermore, our comparison of single particle evaporation energies given by classical and quan-

tum results suggests in both cases the formation of an initial shell of about ten He atoms which

are more strongly bound to the central ion. On the other hand, beyond that initial shell the cluster

growth appears to be chieﬂy driven by He-He interactions, albeit at energies which are initially

still kept larger than those of the neutral systems by the additional presence of the induction ﬁeld

due to the central ionic core. This bahevior may be compared to that of Na+ and K+ doped Helium

clusters [6] where the ﬁrst solvation shells were found to be of 9 and 12 atoms respectively.

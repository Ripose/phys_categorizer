Vibrational dephasing of nitrogen molecule is known to show highly interesting anomalies near
its gas-liquid critical point. Here we present theoretical and computational studies of the Raman
linewidth of nitrogen along the critical isochore. The linewidth is found to have a lambda shaped
temperature dependence near the critical point. As observed in experimental studies, the calculated
lineshape undergoes a transition from Lorentzian to Gaussian and again to Lorentzian form as the
critical temperature (Tc) is approached and crossed from above. We show that the slow decay of
the enhanced density ﬂuctuations near the critical point, probed at the femtosecond time scales by
vibrational frequency modulation, is the root cause of the observed anomalies.

As the critical point of a ﬂuid is approached, several
dynamical properties of the system, such as the ther-
mal conductivity and the bulk viscosity, show anomalous
behaviour – the two mentioned above actually diverge.
The best known and the most widely studied experimen-
tal probe of these anomalies is the dynamic light scat-
tering where the linewidth of the central Rayleigh spec-
trum sharply goes to zero as the critical temperature is
approached from above. This is known as critical slow-
ing down[1, 2]. The anomalous behaviour is physically
explained by exploiting the divergence of the correla-
tion length and using the dynamic mode coupling the-
ory (MCT)[3, 4]. Studies have often been directed to
explore the possibility of similar anomalous behaviour in
chemical rate processes near the critical temperature. In
the recent years, several anomalies have indeed been ob-
served in molecular relaxation processes near the critical
point or in the supercritical ﬂuid. One of them is the
surprising augmentation of the solvent density around a
solute[5, 6]. Another interesting case is the vibrational
phase relaxation which shows more than one anomaly,
yet to be understood.

In their experiments, Clouter et al.[7] found that the
isotropic Raman lineshape of a simple ﬂuid like N2 ex-
hibits a remarkable additional non-rotational broaden-
ing near the gas-liquid critical points (ρcrit, Tcrit). They
measured the Raman spectra along the triple point to
the critical point and the behaviour of the lineshape as
the critical point is approached from above. Recently
Musso et al.[8] measured the temperature dependence of
the lineshape parameters (i.e shift, width and asymme-
try) both along the coexistence and the critical isochore
of liquid nitrogen and found that the temperature depen-
dent linewidth (Γ) is λ shaped. The lineshape was found
to undergo a change from Lorentzian (away form Tc) to

Gaussian (near Tc).

The observation of such anomalies has, till now, deﬁed
a convincing explanation. Mukamel, Stern and Ronis [9]
had earlier interpreted the rapid broadening of Raman
lineshape as a manifestation of dynamical critical phe-
nomena. This interpretation raises the following ques-
tions. As the microscopic time correlation function(tcf)
involved decays in less than a picosecond (actually in
about 200 fs), why and how are the slow long wavelength
density ﬂuctuations important and relevant? This is es-
pecially so because dephasing is a process which probes
essentially only the nearest-neighbour dynamics. The
physics here is clearly diﬀerent from the ones involved
in the critical slowing down at the long wavelengths.

In a recent investigation, vibrational phase relaxation
of the fundamental and the overtones of the N-N stretch
in pure nitrogen was simulated by MD simulations, and
the mode coupling theory (MCT)[10] was used to ex-
plain the simulation results. This study could repro-
duce the rapid rise in dephasing rate as the critical point
is approached along the co-existence line, although it
didn’t include the vibrational coordinate(q) dependence
of the inter-atomic potential and ignored the cross-term
between the vibration-rotation coupling and force and
their derivatives. Everitt and Skinner [11] studied the
Raman lineshape of nitrogen in a systematic way by in-
cluding of the bond length dependence of the dispersion
and repulsive force parameters along the coexistence line
of nitrogen. They also incorporated the cross-correlation
terms which were neglected earlier. Their results for
the lineshifts and linewidths along the gas-liquid coex-
istence of N2 are in good agreement with experimental
results. These theoretical studies did not consider de-
phasing along the critical isochore. In addition, a con-
vincing picture of anomalies did not emerge. The results
presented in this Letter provide ﬁrst microscopic expla-
nation of the above anomalies.

The theories of the vibrational dephasing are all
based on Kubo’s stochastic theory of the lineshape[12],

extended to the study of vibrational dephasing by
Oxtoby[13, 14]. The isotropic Raman lineshape, I (ω),
is the Fourier transform of the normal coordinate tcf,
CQ(t)[13],

A cumulant expansion of Eq.(1) followed by truncation

The frequency ﬂuctuation tcf, Cω(t) =< ∆ω(t)∆ω(0) >,
derives contributions from the atom-atom(AA), reso-
nance(Rs), vibration-rotation(VR) coupling, and also the
cross-terms[13, 14]. We calculated the linewidth, the line-
shape and the dephasing time of N2 for diﬀerent thermo-
dynamical state points of nitrogen, both along the coex-
istence line and the critical isochore, using Eqs. 1 and 2.
The Hamiltonian of homonuclear diatomic molecules can
be written as

H = Hv + T(~q) + U(~q),

(3)

Where Hv is the vibrational Hamiltonian, T(~q) is the
total translational and rotational kinetic energy, U(~q) is
the the inter-molecular potential energy, and ~q is the col-
lection of vibration coordinates qi . The inter-molecular
potential energy is sum of the following site-site (Vij )
between two molecules i and j[11],

The vibrational coordinate dependence of Lennard-Jones
parameters are given by, ǫiαjβ = √ǫiαǫjβ = ǫ(1 + γqi +
γqj + 2γ2qiqj) and σiαjβ =

(cid:16)
The concept of the linear expansion of the Lennard-Jones
potential parameters on vibrational coordinates play an
important role in obtaining the corrected sign of the
lineshift, as mentioned by Skinner and Everitt[11]. We
use the linear expansion coeﬃcients γ and δ as deter-
mined by them [11, 16].

Microcanonical (NVE) MD simulations[17] were car-
ried along the coexistence line and along the critical iso-
chore using the leap-frog algorithm for diﬀerent thermo-
dynamical state points of nitrogen. A system of 256 di-
atomic particles was enclosed in a cubic box, and periodic
boundary conditions were used. In simulation, the sys-
tem was allowed to equilibrate for 100 000 time steps with

∆t =0.0002τ , where τ [ =
of the molecule ] is found to be equal to 3.147 ps. The
p
averages were calculated over 400 000 MD steps. The
thermodynamic state of the system can be expressed in
terms of the reduced density of ρ∗ = ρσ3 and a reduced
temperature of T ∗ = kBT /ǫ. The density of the system
has been expressed in terms of number of molecules per
unit volume times σ3 and the temperature is in units of
ǫ/kB. Where σ and kB is the Lennard-Jones diameter of
the molecule and is the Boltzmann constant, respectively.
Limited number of simulations have been done with N =

squares are the linewidth for diﬀerent state points along
the coexistence curve of nitrogen and the solid circles are
the linewidth along the critical isochore. The interest-
ing feature in the ﬁgure is the lambda-shaped linewidth
when the values for two diﬀerent regions of nitrogen are
presented together. This ﬁgure is very similar to the one
observed experimentally (see ﬁgure 4 of Ref.[8]). It is in-
teresting to note the sharp rise in the dephasing rate as
the critical point is approached.

To understand the origin of this critical behaviour, we
carefully analyzed each of the six terms (three auto corre-
lations and three cross-terms between density, vibration-
rotation coupling and resonance), which are responsi-
ble for the modulation of the vibrational frequency for
fundamental transition. Two terms are found to domi-
nate near the critical point and these are the density and
the vibration-rotation coupling. The temperature depen-
dence of these two terms are shown in ﬁgure 2 where the

grand as the critical temperature is approached, and the
fall when it is crossed. We have found that both these
contributions at the critical point are distinct compared
to the other state points. Thus, the rise and fall of de-
phasing rate arises partly from the rise and fall in the
density and the vibration-rotation terms. A crossover

from Lorentzian to Gaussian lineshape can happen when
the usually large separation in the time scales of decay of
Cω(t) and CQ(t) [8, 13] cease to exist and the two time
correlation functions begin to overlap.
In ﬁgure 3 we
plot Cω(t) and CQ(t) for three temperatures. Near the
critical temperature, the decay of CQ(t) becomes notice-
ably faster, reducing the gap of decay between the two
correlation functions.
Indeed, the computed lineshape
becomes Gaussian near the critical point but otherwise
remains Lorentzian both above and below the critical
temperature. Note that the frequency modulation tcf
decays fully in about 200 fs.What could be the reason for
this dramatic crossover behaviour? The increase in den-
sity ﬂuctuations[9, 18] near the critical point increases

< ∆ω2
i >. This leads itself to an increase in the rate of
decay of the normal coordinate tcf, (CQ(t)). In addition,
the frequency modulation tcf slows down somewhat (see
ﬁgure 3b)[5]. As the decay of these two time correlation
functions become comparable, the lineshape goes over to
the Gaussian form. This happens only very close to the
critical point. This a novel eﬀect and diﬀerent from that
commonly encountered.

To further explore the origin of these anomalous criti-
cal temperature eﬀects, we have investigated for the pres-
ence of dynamical heterogeneities in the ﬂuid at three
temperatures near the critical point, by calculating the
well-known non-Gaussian parameter α(t) deﬁned as[19],

α(t) =

where < ∆r(t)2 > is the mean squared displacement and
< ∆r(t)4 > the mean quartic displacement of the cen-
ter of mass of nitrogen molecule. It can only approach
zero (and hence Gaussian behaviour) for times exceeding
the time scale required for individual particles to sam-
ple their complete kinetic environments. As can be seen
from ﬁgure 4, the function α(t) is large near critical point
at times 0.5 - 5 ps, indicating the presence of long lived
heterogeneities near Tc.
The contribution of the density term reﬂects
the combined eﬀects of collisions, repulsive and attrac-
tive interactions on the friction on the bond. This term
naturally grows as the critical point is approached. The

has a diﬀerent origin. This increase is due to the slowing
down of the rotational time correlation function[5] near
the critical point. As we approach the critical point, the
number of molecules having slow decay of rotational time
correlation function increases. We have carried out fur-
ther theoretical analysis of the density term by using the
mode coupling theory. While one can describe the aver-
age eﬀect of density ﬂuctuation through the divergence

4

of the static structure factor S(k) at small wavenumbers,
this approach does not capture the full scenario. This is
because the decay of the frequency ﬂuctuation time cor-
relation function (Cω(t)) occurs in the femtosecond time
scale. At that time scale, the density ﬂuctuation is nearly
static. Thus, vibrational dephasing provides snap shots
of the large density ﬂuctuations present near the critical
temperature. Even more interesting is the origin of the
ultrafast decay of Cω(t)–this is partly due to the cancel-
lation which arises from the cross-terms of VR coupling
with the density and the resonance terms. These terms
have sign opposite to the pure terms but have compara-
ble magnitude, leading to dramatic enhancement in the
rate of decay of Cω(t). The reason for such large negative
cross-correlation is yet to be understood.

It is indeed surprising that our simulations could cap-
ture essentially all the novel features observed in experi-
ments, including the lambda shaped temperature depen-
dence of the dephasing rate and the cross-over from the
Lorentzian to the Gaussian form. Theoretical analysis
shows that the nearly static density ﬂuctuation (in the
time scale of Cω(t)) is the primary cause of these anoma-
lies.

ABSTRACT

We demonstrate that the multicanonical approach is not restricted to Monte Carlo
simulations, but can also be applied to simulation techniques such as molecular dynam-
ics, Langevin, and hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms. The eﬀectiveness of the methods
are tested with an energy function for the protein folding problem. Simulations in the
multicanonical ensemble by the three methods are performed for a penta peptide, Met-
enkephalin. For each algorithm, it is shown that from only one simulation run one can
not only ﬁnd the global-minimum-energy conformation but also obtain probability dis-
tributions in canonical ensemble at any temperature, which allows the calculation of any
thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature.

INTRODUCTION

Simulations in a system with many degrees of freedom by conventional methods such as

molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) can sample only a small portion of

the entire phase space, rendering the calculations of various thermodynamic quantities

inaccurate. This is because the energy function has many local minima, and at low tem-

peratures simulations will necessarily get trapped in the conﬁgurations corresponding to

one of these local minima.

In order to overcome this multiple-minima problem, many

methods have been proposed. For instance, simulated annealing [1] is one of the most

widely used algorithms to locate the global-minimum state out of the multitude of local-

minimum states. The multicanonical approach [2, 3] is another powerful technique. The

advantage of this algorithm lies in the fact that from only one simulation run one can not

only ﬁnd the energy global minimum but also calculate various thermodynamic quantities

at any temperature. The method was originally developed to overcome the supercritical

slowing down of ﬁrst-order phase transitions,[2, 3] and it was then proposed to be used for

systems that suﬀer from the multiple-minima problem such as spin glasses [4] and the pro-

tein folding problem.[5] The same method was later referred to as entropic sampling,[6] but

the proof of the equivalence of the two methods was given to clarify the matter.[7] In the

context of the protein folding problem, the eﬀectiveness of multicanonical algorithms was

compared with that of simulated annealing.[8] It was also used to study the coil-globular

transitions of a model protein,[9] helix-coil transitions of amino-acid homo-oligomers,[10]

and conformational sampling of a constrained peptide.[11]

In all of the previous works the multicanonical ansatz was used in the context of

Monte Carlo simulations utilizing mostly the Metropolis algorithm [12] to generate a

Markov chain of conﬁgurations. However, other simulation techniques such as molecular

dynamics [13] are also widely used. The purpose of the present work is to demonstrate

that these techniques can be used for simulations in multicanonical ensemble. Here, we

consider three common algorithms: molecular dynamics, Langevin,[14] and hybrid Monte

Carlo.[15] The performance of the algorithms are tested with the system of an oligopep-

tide, Met-enkephalin.

2. METHODS

2.1. Multicanonical ensemble

mann factor

Simulations in the canonical ensemble at temperature T weigh each state with the Boltz-

where the inverse temperature is given by ˆβ = 1

kB T with Boltzmann constant kB. This

weight factor gives the usual bell-shaped canonical probability distribution of energy:

wB(E, T ) = e− ˆβE ,

PB(E, T ) ∝ n(E) wB(E, T ) ,

where n(E) is the density of states.

energy is deﬁned to be constant:

In the multicanonical ensemble,[2] on the other hand, the probability distribution of

Pmu(E) ∝ n(E) wmu(E) = const.

The multicanonical weight factor for each state with energy E is then given by

wmu(E) ∝ n−1(E) = e−S(E) ,

where S(E) is the microcanonical entropy (with kB = 1):

S(E) = ln n(E) .

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

With the uniform probability distribution of Eq. (3), a simulation in multicanonical en-

semble leads to a 1D random walk in energy space, allowing itself to escape from any

energy barrier and to explore wide range of the phase space.

Unlike in a canonical simulation, however, the multicanonical weight wmu(E) is not

a priori known, and one has to obtain its estimator for a numerical simulation. Hence,

the multicanonical ansatz consists of three steps: In the ﬁrst step the estimator of the

multicanonical weight factor wmu(E) is calculated (for details of the method of ﬁnding

wmu(E) for the case of Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm, see Refs. [3, 8]). Then one

makes with this weight factor a production run with high statistics. In this way infor-

mation is collected over the whole energy range. Finally, by examining the history of

3

this simulation, one can not only locate the energy global minimum but also obtain the
canonical distribution at any inverse temperature ˆβ for a wide range of temperatures by

the re-weighting techniques:[16]

This allows one to calculate the expectation value of any physical quantity O by

PB(E, T ) ∝ Pmu(E) w−1

mu(E) e− ˆβE .

In the following subsections, we describe how to implement multicanonical simulations

for Langevin, molecular dynamics, and hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms.

2.2. Langevin algorithm in multicanonical ensemble

The Langevin algorithm[14] is used to integrate the following diﬀerential equation:

˙qi = − ˆβ

∂E(q)
∂qi

+ ηi ,

where qi (i = 1, · · · , N) are the (generalized) coodinates of the system, E(q) is the potential

energy, and ηi is a set of independent Gaussian distributed random variables with a unit

variance:

< ηi(tl)ηj(tm) >= δijδ(tl − tm).

It can be shown that the dynamics based on the Langevin algorithm yields a canonical
distribution PB(E, T ) ∝ n(E)e− ˆβE. For numerical work one integrates the above equation

by discretizing the time with step ∆t :

qi(t + ∆t) = qi(t) + ∆t

− ˆβ

 

∂E(q)
∂qi(t)

+ ηi(t)

.

!

A straightforward generalization of this technique to simulations in multicanonical

ensemble can be made by replacing the ˆβE in Eq. (8) by the microcanonical entropy

S(E):

˙qi = −

∂S(E(q))
∂qi

+ ηi .

The above equation now describes a dynamics which will yield a multicanonical distri-
bution Pmu(E) ∝ n(E)e−S(E) = const. (see Eq. (4)). (A similar consideration of multi-

canonical Langevin algorithm is given in Ref. [17].) Hence, for actual simulations we use

4

(10)

(11)

the following diﬀerence equation:

qi(t + ∆t) = qi(t) + ∆t

−

∂S(E(q))
∂qi(t)

 

+ ηi(t)

.

!

We remark that Eq. (11) can be written as

˙qi = −

∂S
∂E

∂E(q)
∂qi

+ ηi = −β(E)

+ ηi ,

∂E(q)
∂qi

where β(E) is an energy-dependent eﬀective inverse temperature. In this notation the

term “multicanonical” becomes obvious (compare Eq. (13) with Eq. (8)).

2.3. Molecular dynamics algorithm in multicanonical ensemble

The expectation value of a physical quantity O is calculated by

< O >T = Z

Dq O(q)e− ˆβE(q)

Dq e− ˆβE(q)

where the integration measure is deﬁned by Dq =

In order to generalize this widely used technique to simulations in multicanonical

ensemble, we again propose to replace ˆβE by the entropy S(E) in Eqs. (17), (18), and

(19) (just as we did for the Langevin algorithm). Hence, we have a new “Hamiltonian”

This is the set of equations we adopt for multicanonical MD simulations. Formally it can

be understood as a rescaling of the usual force term by the derivative of the entropy. For

numerical simulations the Hamilton equations are again discretized in time and integrated

by a leapfrog scheme.

2.4. Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in multicanonical ensemble

The hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm[15] is based on the combination of molecular dynam-

ics and Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithms. Namely, each proposal for the Metropolis

method is prepared by a short MD run starting from the actual conﬁguration. Hence,

this algorithm is based on a global update, while in the conventional Metropolis method

one is usually restricted to a local update. Furthermore, the Metropolis step ensures that

the sampled conﬁgurations are distributed according to the chosen ensemble, while con-

vential molecular dynamics simulations are hampered by diﬃcult-to-control systematic

errors due to ﬁnite step size in the integration of the equations of motion.

6

Given the set of coordinates {qi} of the previous conﬁguration and choosing the cor-

responding momenta {πi} from a Gaussian distribution, a certain number of MD steps
are performed to obtain a candidate conﬁguration {q′

i}. This candidate is accepted

i, π′

according to the Metropolis Monte Carlo criterion with probability

p = min{1, e−(H(q′,π′)−H(q,π))} ,

(22)

where H is the Hamiltonian in Eq. (16). The time reversibility of the leapfrog integration

scheme ensures detailed balance and therefore convergence to the correct distribution. The

whole process is repeated for a desired number of times (Monte Carlo steps). The number

of integration (leapfrog) steps NLF and the size of the time step ∆t are free parameters

in the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, which have to be tuned carefully. A choice of too

small NLF and ∆t means that the sampled conﬁgurations are too much correlated, while

too large NLF (or ∆t) yields high rejection rates. In both cases the algorithm becomes

ineﬃcient.

The generalization of this technique to simulations in multicanonical ensemble can

again be made by replacing the Hamiltonian of Eq. (16) with the multicanonical Hamil-
tonian of Eq. (20), i.e., replacing ˆβE by the entropy S(E) in the equations of motion.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The eﬀectiveness of the algorithms presented in the previous section is tested for the

system of an oligopeptide, Met-enkephalin. This peptide has the amino-acid sequence

Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met. The potential energy function that we used is given by the sum

of electrostatic term, Lennard-Jones term, and hydrogen-bond term for all pairs of atoms

in the peptide together with the torsion term for all torsion angles. The parameters for

the energy function were adopted from ECEPP/2.[18]-[20] The computer code SMC [21]

was modiﬁed to accomodate the multicanonical ensemble.

For the coordinates {qi} we used the dihedral angles. ( We remark that it was recently

claimed that convergence is faster for the dihedral coordinates.[22] Of course we could have

used Cartesian coordinates as well with the same set of equations.) The peptide-bond
dihedral angles ω were ﬁxed to be 180◦ for simplicity. This leaves 19 dihedral angles

as generalized coordinates. By deﬁnition of multicanonical ensemble, one cannot obtain

7

information on the real dynamics of the system by the MD algorithm, and only static

thermodynamic quantities can be calculated. For this reason we do not need to consider

the equations of motion for dihedral space as presented in Ref. [23], but can use the much

simpler form as given in the previous section. However, we remark that this may not be

the optimal choice. Very often it may be more suitable to distinguish between “soft” and

“hard” degrees of freedom and introduce appropriately chosen “masses” in the equations

of motion.[22]

For the multicanonical MD simulations, we made a single production run with the total

number of time steps NLF = 400, 000 ∗ 19 and the time-step size ∆t = 0.005 (in arbitary

units), after the optimal estimate for the multicanonical weight factor wmu(E), or entropy

S(E), was obtained. For the multicanonical Langevin algorithm, a production run with

the same number of time steps (NLF = 400, 000 ∗ 19) as in the MD simulation, but our

optimal time-step size was only ∆t = 0.0001. This indicates that the simulation moves

more slowly through phase space, and we expect slower convergence to the multicanonical

distribution than in MD case. For the multicanonical hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm,

an MD simulation with 19 leapfrog steps was made for each Monte Carlo step and a

production run with 200,000 MC steps was made. Since the Metropolis step in hybrid

Monte Carlo corrects for errors due to the numerical integration of the equation of motion,

the time-step size can be large for this algorithm. We chose ∆t = 0.01 in our units. The

initial conformation for all three simulations was the ﬁnal (and therefore equilibrized)

conformation obtained from a multicanonical Monte Carlo simulation of 200,000 sweeps,

following 1,000 sweeps for thermalization with the same weights (in each sweep all of the

19 angles were updated once).

In Fig. 1 the time series of the total potential energy are shown for the three mul-

ticanonical simulations. They all display a random walk in energy as they should for

a simulation in multicanonical ensemble. All the lowest-energy conformations were es-

sentially the same (with only a small amount of deviations for each dihedral angle) as

that of the global-minimum energy conformation previously obtained for the same energy
function (with ω = 180◦) by other methods.[24, 5, 25] The global-minimum potential

energy value obtained by minimization is −10.7 kcal/mol.[25] The random walks of the

8

MD and hybrid MC simulations visited the global-minimum region (E < −10 kcal/mol)

three times and ﬁve times, respectively, while that of the Langevin simulation reached the

region only once. These visits are separated by the walks towards the high energy region

much above E = 16 kcal/mol, which corresponds to the average energy at T = 1000 K.[5]

In Fig. 2a the time series of the end-to-end distance r is plotted. Here, the distance was

measured from N of Tyr 1 to O of Met 5. Only the result from the multicanonical hybrid

Monte Carlo simulation is given, since the other two simulations give similar results. Note

that there is a positive correlation between potential energy E and end-to-end distance

r (compare Figs. 1c and 2a), indicating that a folded structure generally has a lower

potential energy than a stretched one. This becomes even clearer in Fig. 2b, where we

display the average end-to-end distance r as a function of potential energy E.

In Fig. 3 we demonstrate that the probability distribution Pmu(E) of potential energy

E obtained from the multicanonical MD simulation is essentially ﬂat (of the same order

of magnitude) over the whole energy range. Similar ﬁgures can be drawn for the other

two algorithms.

In Fig. 4 the entropy S(E) calculated from the probability distribution Pmu(E) is dis-

played (see Eqs. (3) and (4)). Only the result from multicanonical MD simulation is given,

since the other two simulations give essentially the same results. It is a monotonically

increasing function. Note that there is a sudden drop of S(E) near E = −10 kcal/mol,

suggesting that the global-minimum conformation is “unique”.

Simulations in multicanonical ensemble can not only ﬁnd the energy global minimum

but also any thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature from a single simula-

tion run. We have calculated the speciﬁc heat and average potential energy as functions

of temperature for the three algorithms. The results all agreed within errors with those

from our previous multicanonical MC runs (see, for instance, Refs. [5, 8]). Here, we just

show another example of such a calculation, the average end-to-end distance as a function

of temperature. The results are essentially the same for the three algorithms. That from

multicanonical Langevin algorithm is shown in Fig. 5. We see that the average end-to-end

distance becomes smaller as the temperature is lowered, indicating that the peptide has

a compact structure at low temperatures.

CONCLUSIONS

In this article we have shown that the multicanonical ansatz is not restricted to Monte

Carlo simulations, but can also be used in combination with other simulation methods

such as molecular dynamics, Langevin, and hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms. We have

tested the performances of these three methods in multicanonical ensemble for a simple

peptide, Met-enkephalin. The results were comparable to those of the original Monte

Carlo version.[5] We believe that there is a wide range of applications for multicanonical

versions of molecular dynamics and related algorithms. For instance, multicanonical MD

simulations may prove to be a valuable tool for reﬁnement of the protein structures inferred

from X-ray and/or NMR experiments.

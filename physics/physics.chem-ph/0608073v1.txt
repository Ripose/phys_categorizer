reactions at equilibrium from MD: framework
and proposals for thermokinetics

Abstract

The rates or formation and concentration distributions of a dimer re-
action showing hysteresis behavior are examined in an ab initio chemical
reaction designed as elementary and where the hysteresis structure pre-
cludes the formation of transition states (TS) with pre-equilibrium and
internal sub-reactions.
It was discovered that the the reactivity coeﬃ-
cients, deﬁned as a measure of departure from the zero density rate con-
stant for the forward and backward steps had a ratio that was equal to the
activity coeﬃcient ratio for the product and reactant species. This sur-
prising result, never formally noticed nor incorporated in elementary rate
expressions over approximately one and a half centuries of quantitative
chemical kinetics measurement and calculation is accepted axiomatically
and leads to an outline of a theory for the form of the rate constant, in
any one given substrate - here the vacuum state. A major deduction is
that the long-standing deﬁnition of the rate constant used for over a cen-
tury and a half for elementary reactions is not complete, where previous
works almost always implicitly refer to the zero density limit for strictly
irreducible elementary reactions without any any attending concatenation
of side-reactions. This is shown directly from MD simulation,where for
specially designed elementary reactions without any transition states, den-
sity dependence of reactants and products always feature, in contrast to
current practice. It is argued that the rate constant expression without re-
actant and product dependence is due to historical conventions for strictly
elementary reactions. From the above observations, a theory is developed
with the aid of some proven elementary theorems in thermodynamics, and
expressions under diﬀerent state conditions are derived whereby a feasible
experimental and computational method for determining the activity coef-
ﬁcients from the rate constants may be obtained under various approxima-
tions and conditions. Elementary relations for subspecies equilibria and
its relation to the bulk activity coeﬃcient are discussed. From one choice
of reaction conditions, estimates of activity coeﬃcients are given which

Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles for the atomic component. The theory de-
veloped is applied to ionic reactions where the standard Br¨onsted-Bjerrum
rate equation and exceptions to this are rationalized, and by viewing ion
association as a n-meric process, ion activity coeﬃcients may in principle
be determined under varying applicable assumptions.

Introduction

Previous work has detailed a hysteresis model of a simple dimer reaction [1, 2, 3]
where the coordinates for molecular formation rf and breakdown rb are not at
the same vicinity, as shown in Fig.(1). If both these points coincided, then one
could in principle deﬁne a volume region about the point rf = rb that would
serve as the transition state pre-equilibrium T S, suggesting a composite reaction
such as

2A ⇋ T S

A2

→

(1)

which is therefore not strictly elementary since (1) is a summation of elementary
steps to yield a net reaction. The current model precludes such a possibility
, implying a strictly elementary reaction process. Previous models, especially
that of Eyring postulated the pre-equilibrium TS which was also interpreted
experimentally [4] but the most recent developments in some cases by-passes
this development [5, 6]. In the theory that follows, the T S refers to the point
in state space whose neighborhood always includes product and reactant states.
The method for treating changes of potential via switch mechanisms were also
outlined[1, 2, 3], together with an algorithm which was implemented to conserve
energy and momentum at high energy regions with steep potential gradients.
This work focuses primarily on the form of the elementary rate constants for
the reaction, and presents a way of determining activity and reactivity coeﬃ-
cients; the two concepts are diﬀerent, and will be deﬁned in this work, where
under certain conditions, the activity coeﬃcients might be determined. These
two types of coeﬃcients are discriminated by ﬁrst introducing an ansatz of the
dependency of the reactivity coeﬃcients on the rate constants and comparing
the results with the actual kinetics of the simulation, where it was discovered
that there were variations of the rate constant with concentration. Section (3)
and its subsections give details of the methods used to determine the extent
of variation. The ratio of the reactivity coeﬃcient Φk agreed numerically with
the results from the activity factor Φe, which is determined independently by
extrapolation of the variation of the concentration equilibrium ratio determined
directly from simulation. This observation is used to develop a theory for the
form elementary reaction rate constants take, which does not accord with stan-
dard assumptions. The above objectives are realized by ﬁrst describing the
model of the elementary reaction in Section (2). The empirical result of the
equivalence of the reactivity and activity coeﬃcient ratios is developed in Sec-
tion (3) and the subsections where the consequences are discussed in depth.
The uniqueness of the activity coeﬃcient and various other associated results

2

appear in Section(3.3). Veriﬁcation of the theories concerning the role of ac-
tivity coeﬃcients in elementary reactions is given in reference to results from
the literature for non-reacting LJ particles, where it is argued that the residual
Helmholtz energy Ares is a better measure for computing the activity coeﬃcient
for multi-component system than the residual free energy Gres (Sections (3.4.1-
3.6.3)). In either case, the activity coeﬃcient for the unreacted particle increases
with system concentration and is positive. Of two possibilities for the estimate
of the activity coeﬃcient derived from energy considerations of the dimer and
single particle trajectory along the reaction coordinate, only one accords with
observation derived from simulation data from the literature for the activity
coeﬃcient of the atom, with semi-quantitative agreement. From the form of the
activity/availability coeﬃcients, rudimentary mechanisms involving single and
double stages (Sections (3.6.1-3.6.3))are proposed for elementary reactions. It
is suggested that the 2-stage mechanisms is the more appropriate, and an inter-
pretation of the Br¨onsted-Bjerrum (BB) rate equation is made on the basis of
the two-stage model (Sections (3.6.4-3.6.5)). The conclusion (Section(4))brings
into focus all the details of the preceding sections.

2 The Model

The simulation model is a dimeric particle reaction

potentials given in Fig. 1 are used. In this model, 2 free atoms ”‘react”’ at rf
where a switch mechanism converts the potential to the harmonic intermolecular
potential. The molecule ”‘breaks”’ at rb where the potential reverts to the LJ
type. At these points, a specialized algorithm was used to conserve energy and
momentum and this too has been described in detail [3, 7]. The free atoms A
interact with all other particles (whether A or A2) via a Lennard-Jones spline
potential and this type of potential has been described in much detail [9]. An
atom at a distance r to another particle possesses a mutual potential energy

3 Thermodynamic results from equilibrium mix-

tures

Details of the runs have been described elsewhere [7]. Typical runs of 10 mil-
lion (10M ) time steps were performed at each general system particle density
ρ (where ρ refers to the particle which is either free or part of a molecule),
where the ﬁrst 200,000 steps were discarded so that proper equilibration could
be achieved for our data samples. The sampling methods have been previously
described [9] where sampling of all data variables were done each 20th time step

r
b

and where the data were averaged and written into a dump ﬁle of 100 dumps
for the 10M million time steps. The averaged values in each dump were further
averaged to yield the ﬁnal averages and standard errors. Dynamical quantities
however had to be sampled at each time step δt∗ = 0.00005. In view of the ab-
normally high temperatures –not hitherto encountered in almost all simulation
studies– this time step value was found to be not too small. The system was
thermostatted at the ends of the MD cell only, but very similar unpublished
results with less variable ﬂuctuation was obtained by thermostatting each layer
with strict conservation of momentum during the thermostatting process [10]
which involves solving coupled equations for each thermostatted layer. But it
was desired to mimic the actual experimental situation where the reservoirs
occurred at the boundary location of the system.It is surmised that reservoir
boundary conditions could play a pivotal role in determining the product out-
comes of reactions sensitive to energy ﬂuctuations. The term sde in the ﬁgure
captions refer to the standard error.

3.1 Equilibrium constants

Two independent methods ( (i) and (ii) ) were used to conﬁrm the thermody-
namical results.
(i) Time independent distribution sampling method
In order to ﬁnd the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, Keq, the following
procedure was adopted. The concentration ratio, Kc deﬁned as

Kc =

xA2
x2
A

(7)

was determined as a function of average system density, ρ where the x’s repre-
sent number density concentrations of the species indicated by subscript for the
reaction (2). At very small densities, the system becomes an ’ideal’ mixture,
but as illustrated previously [1], the limit of the potentials cannot be the same
as the isolated potentials used in the MD calculations, since if this were the
case, all the molecules would break up, yielding a net zero value for the equi-
librium constant at the limit of zero density. As another project, it would be of
interest to determine the limit at which the equilibrium regime breaks down in
this thermostatted system, but there may well be technical diﬃculties involved
in computations of very low density systems. The plot of Kc = Kc(ρ) is shown
in Fig. (2).

It will be noted that the errors in the Kc ratio at low densities are of order
20 times than that at higher densities, where relatively very accurate sampling
is possible. What is observed at very low density is a ”‘saturation”’ or limit
eﬀect for both rates (leading to ﬂuctuations in Kx in method (ii) and depicted
in Fig. (6) and for Kc for this method (i) given in Fig. (3). This allows us
to determine Keq from taking the average value over a range of low ρ in the
saturated range of ρ (here from ρ = 0.03
.09) over about 13 values where

at LJ temperature T ∗ = 8.0 where there is empirically complete coincidence
within experimental uncertainty.

It is evident from the plots that the mixture is highly non-ideal, which may be
expected due to the large diﬀerences in the LJ energy well for the molecule and
the atom (see Fig.(1).

The separate activity coeﬃcients may perhaps be derived from cycle studies
of equilibrium states that include the reference state at inﬁnite dilution. The
derivation might require a series of very elaborate and detailed computations.
However, to date no clear theory nor example has been provided as to how this
might be achieved.

(ii) Kinetic sampling method
From the way the algorithm was constructed for molecular formation, the
molecularity of the elementary reaction is 2 leading to a single second-order
reaction of formation, and for the dissociation of A2, a ﬁrst-order reaction results
since the molecule can only exchange kinetic energy with all other particles
within the system without further reactions to the dissociation limit. There
are many deﬁnitions and conventions for describing the overall rate of reaction
and the individual rate constant. Here, the forward rate constant k0
1 and the
dissociation rate constant k0
1 are deﬁned as the value of the respective rate

constants as ρ

The ratio of rate coeﬃcients is the concentration ratio which is this time written
as Kx and is expressed only as a kinetic ratio where

To verify the above we plot

against the density ρ and extrapolate to zero density to determine the equilib-
rium constant. The rates were calculated independently from the program by
monitoring the number of bonds formed or broken for each time step δt∗ and
averaging this quantity over the 10M time steps. The plots of Q and R at low

reactant and product molecules”’ where if there are two or more elementary
steps involved, as in the Michaelis-Menten reaction, then a ”‘pseudo-elementary
reaction”’ is implicated [11, p.3].The rate coeﬃcient [11, p.7, Chap. 3] is written
k(T ), ”‘ and is generally a function of temperature, and frequently of T only.”’
The onset of perturbations [11, eg. Chap. 11, Oscillatory Reactions ] are due to
species eﬀects not connected to k(T ) where the rate ν of the elementary reaction
is written ν = k(T )[A]α[B]β... and the entire ﬁeld of reaction mechanisms does
not question this representation. The form was established over a century and
a half ago and follows from the law of mass action [12, Chap. 3] which was
suggested by persons which included C.L. Berthollet (1799), M. Berthelot and
P. St. Gilles (1862-63), L. Wilhelmy (1850), H. Rose (1842), A.W. Williamson
(1859) and C. Guldberg and P. Waage (1864-67) where they all in diﬀerent ways
generally inferred that at equilibrium,

k+R1R2.... = k

P1P2...

−

(17)

where the R’s and the P ’s were eﬀectively the mass concentrations of reactants
and products and where the k’s were ”‘coeﬃcients of velocity”’ which were in-
dependent of concentration. This form has been maintained to the present times
no matter how complex the reactions (e.g. possibly involving multi-step clus-
ter and activated thermal electron transfer [13] or complex chemical oscillations
[14]. In the preface of the text devoted to non-linear chemical kinetics [14], it
was surmised ”‘..only ﬁrst order processes escape the non-linear net, and even
these get caught if there is the slightest departure from isothermal operation.”’
2A
On the other hand, in the dimer reaction described here, the ﬁrst order A2 →
process is shown to be non-linear in the most ordinary circumstances. Complex
concentration eﬀects on the rate constant have been structured by postulating
the concatenation of several elementary reactions, meaning that these reactions
are pseudo-elementary according to Ref.
[11], where each elementary reaction
rate constant is strictly concentration independent in all the references hitherto
encountered, and which therefore can be taken to be a universal deﬁnition. In
Eyring’s transition state theory, a scheme

where k′(T ) is strictly temperature dependent, and the γ’s are the activity coeﬃ-
cients; k′(T ) is derived from a product function involving equilibirum constants,
and strictly elementary rate constants, implying no other variable dependency
other than T . Likewise, pressure dependency of unimolecular and association
reactions [16, 1995 edition, p.121-142] are explained by Lindemann-type mech-
anisms involving complex equilibria, which introduces a pressure dependence
on the pseudo-rate constant [16, 1995 edition, p.138, Sec. 5.11, Association

reactions]. Ref.

where various quantum statistical approximations are applied to each elemen-
tary step involving the individual ki(T ) rate constants to derive the overall rate
constant which is ﬁrst order at low reactant concentrations and second order
at high concentrations. As stated elsewhere, Kosloﬀ has gone beyond the T ST
pseudo-elementary reaction theories by developing a straight trajectory model
[17, p.187] which superimposes trajectories with energy grids. More recent
methods, such as developed by Miller [5]involves going beyond TST where an
exact trajectory is calculated ”‘which is no longer a transition state theory”’ [5,
p.387]. However, in these exact treatments, the isolated participants only are

where the CRP (cumulative reaction probability) is calculated for the 4 atom
D calculations). The microcanonical rate constant k(T ) for a bi-
system (6
AB + C is deﬁned such that k(T ) is the canonical
molecular reaction A + BC
d[A]
dt = k(T )[A][BC] and k(T ) is
ensemble rate coeﬃcient in the expression
determined from an integral involving the CRP. A direct evaluation can also be
made without CRP’s [5, p.408, eqn.50] where the direct calculation involves a
ﬂux operator ˆ
which is related to the system Hamiltonian and trajectory which
F
in all these treatments does not include the rest of the environment variables.
A recent example of such direct calculations in given in [18] for gas phase reac-
tions, where the ﬂux operator is a type of commutator ˆ

F
H is the system Hamiltonian and s are the trajectory coordinates with θ being
the heavyside function. Reference [6] is an excellent resume of the most up to
date prominent methods available, all conforming to the k = k(T ) assumption
for elementary reactions where no direct relationship with the activity of the
species has been deduced, as will be attempted here. A brief survey of the re-
cent past also does not yield any exceptions to the standard deﬁnition [19, p.36,
p.109, eq. 3.25, p.239, eq. 7.38]. Espenson [20, p.157]too, writes k = k(T ) for
elementary reactions. In developing the standard Br¨onsted-Bjerrum equation
for the reaction A + B
P (products), he breaks down this reaction into a sum
of elementary reactions [20, eq.9-22]

where he infers [20, p.204], in keeping strictly with the rate constant deﬁ-
nition that ”‘...The rate is taken to be proportional to the concentration (not
the activity !) of the transition state”’, thereby deducing the standard form [20,
p.204, eq.9-27] for the Br¨onsted-Bjerrum equations as

According to the prevailing theories over the centuries, the rate constant proper
is independent of concentration for strictly elementary reactions. Activity coef-
ﬁcients are only introduced via an equilibrium constant as a result of composite
schemes where some pre-equilibrium is postulated, the chief example being ac-
tivated complex theory, and the earlier and related ionic reactions based on
the Br¨onsted-Bjerrum equation. In the present scheme, pre-equilibria has been
ruled out, because the non-reversible, cyclical pathway of the reaction does not
allow for such a situation. The results here show that the conventional deﬁnition
of the rate constant for elementary reactive processes is incomplete, unless the
γ

One may not expect the γ’s to vary between two equilibrium catalytic states
by mutual cancellation but eq.(32) is the general expression. Given the same
mechanism, changes of rate can only be aﬀected by changes in the isolated
intermolecular potentials, or the net potentials due to the sum of all relevant
interactions. Both these cases seem to imply minute changes to the species type.
Provided that these changes do not aﬀect to ﬁrst order ∆G0
r for the standard free
energy change, eq.(32) should obtain approximately. Since Q, R, and the γ′s are
functions of ρ, we can write equations (12) in the form

The plot of the reactivity coeﬃcient is given in Fig. (8)as a function of aver-
age system density. Both coeﬃcients extrapolate to unity. While the reactivity
coeﬃcient of A is larger than unity, that of A2 is smaller than unity, and one
might expect such behavior to arise from the diﬀering potentials and net surface
area to volume ratio that exists for these two species. The reactivity of species
p, ap is deﬁned by ap = γ′p.ρp where ρp is the concentration (e.g. number den-
sity) of species p. A plot of the variation of these quantities appears in Fig. (9),
where the densities refer to the actual number density of the concerned species
and not to the general system density ρ. The looping of the curve for A is very
interesting because with increasing system density, the equilibrium constant ad-
justs itself to accommodate an increasing reactivity coeﬃcient for A, implying
at constant temperature a species density reduction, which explains the looping
back behavior of the reactivity for A. At the current state of development, one
must use physical arguments to determine whether the reactivity and activity
coeﬃcients are identical or not. It is surmised that it is not from considerations
of the estimates of the LJ ﬂuid activity coeﬃcients relative to the boundary
conditions imposed. It is estimated that both the dimer and atomic activity
coeﬃcients either increase or decrease with system density, and therefore can-
not equal the reactivity coeﬃcients where the trend for dimer and atom are in
contrary directions. It is then surmised that the activities both increase with
system concentration by comparison with the LJ ﬂuid for the atomic constituent.
Before examining the thermodynamics of the single component monomer A, we
digress to an outline of a theory of internal species equilibrium that is of use to
describe species states along a reaction pathway.

3.3.1 Internal equilibrium of product species

It was conjectured that a subsystem described by non-canonical coordinates
would have a Boltzmannized energy distribution for the kinetic energy if the
energy interaction of the coordinate were due solely to external forces (due to
the reservoir). This conjecture is extended to the external potential here; in
fact the Debye-Huckel (DH) and extended theories of electrolyte solutions all
make this assumption [25]. Under this assumption, a particular species Z (being
either product P or reactant R species in the equilibrium R ⇋ P ) can exist in p
varying energy states Z1, Z2, . . . Zp as enumerated by an appropriate algorithm.
The enumeration may be with respect to energy states in terms of a coarse
grid of magnitude ∆E; such techniques have been developed in recent times

by Kosloﬀ [17, p.187]who superimposes reaction dynamics trajectories with a
gridded ”‘energy range of molecular encounter ∆E ...typically in the range of
0
10 eV.”’ And It will be further assumed that a convenient algorithm ex-
ists for this purpose. The example given here is for reasons of illustration, to
show that the activity coeﬃcient may be determined at any point if a partial
enumeration were known, and to extend the DH theoretical assumption. The
science of enumeration has made much progress in recent years, especially in
the characterization of species types in mathematical chemistry, whose pioneers
include Balaban[26]. The techniques developed for chemical structures could
conceivably be extended to these cluster types. The temperature of each of the
species in the enumeration is approximated as the same as the system temper-
ature T determined from 3kT
where it has been shown that they may
diﬀer slightly since they are not the canonical coordinates [8]. Hence this theory

is an approximation. Then the chemical potential µZi of each of these states

It will be noted that (39) can refer to a partial (incomplete) enumeration where
the ith enumeration need not be in the set if the Gibbs equilibrium criterion
obtains for the ith species in equilibrium with the other species.
What is the relationship between the diﬀerent c and γ coeﬃcients?
For a complete enumeration over an energy grid, each of which has an energy
diﬀerence of magnitude ∆E, the average potential experienced by the species X
is w, so that w = kT ln γtot by deﬁnition, where µZ = µ0

3.4 Thermodynamics of ﬂuid and discussion of the c(ρ)

scaling function

Lemma(3) implies that since the activity coeﬃcients are unique relative to scal-
ing, an attempt to estimate c(ρ) can come only from physical/kinetic experi-
mental considerations,where this function should not contradict ancillary data
and estimates. One can expect the activity coeﬃcient of the A atom to be
approximately that of the LJ ﬂuid at the same density and temperature at low
dimer concentrations. A rationale must be provided on how to estimate this
quantity from available data. Some data exists [27, 28] for the LJ ﬂuid up to
T ∗ = 6.0. At such temperatures, the ﬁtting is highly sensitive to the γ coeﬃ-
cients, unlike what was reported [28, sec.4,p.607] (presumably for much lower
T values, where γ was regressed for 1
7 with low correlation of the mini-
≤
mum). The parameters for the various estimates for the monomer activity was
scanned from the x(i) values in Table 4. of [27] and ﬁtted into the equations
found in [28]. The residual or excess Helmholtz free energy in reduced units,
which is the diﬀerence between the ideal gas value and the actual value is given

The reduced units variables are denoted by

coeﬃcients are given as complex polynomials in x(i) and T ∗ in the tables in
[28]. It was found that at T ∗ = 6 , a good value for γ (to the nearest digit)
was 2.7 which yielded the ﬁtting pressure of 12.7931, close to the experimental
value of 12.43(2) in the phase diagram. The simulations here were oﬀ-scale at
T ∗ = 8.0, but nevertheless the value of γ given above was adopted for estimating
the excess free energies at the simulation temperature as well as the atomic γA
coeﬃcients according to the theoretical model below.

A circular reasoning has been detected in the deﬁnition of multicomponent
Gibbsian free energies [29, p.706, Sec. 5] and the associated chemical potential,
where it was pointed out that the T dS term deﬁned by Denbigh [30] sometimes
referred to a heat input term for multicomponent closed systems, and some-
times not, leading to an undecided paradox, but where the chemical potential is
a pure work term; in the new exact thermodynamics [29, p.707, after eqn(30)],
the chemical potential is a mixed heat-work term. In this work, we shall con-
form to conventional descriptions, thereby reinterpreting the physical meaning
It will be argued here that relative to
of some of the standard expressions.
the concentration where the chemical potential is written µi = µ0
i + kT ln ciγi,
and where this term represents isothermal work done on the system, the excess

20

Helmholtz energy A∗r seems to refer to the γi activity coeﬃcient (here analogous
to the ”‘fugacity”’) coeﬃcient and not the excess Gibbs free energy G∗r for the
reasons that follow. For a single phase at constant temperature, dG = V dp
and for a perfect classical ﬂuid ∆G =
pdV where the work loss
on the system is equivalent to ∆G but this is not true of imperfect systems. It
R
will be proved from the Kelvin-Clausius statement that the external work (if it
were the sole work source) takes into account the internal intermolecular forces.
The chemical potential µi ≡

work of expansion) is increased per unit amount of substance added....”’ is often

of some others who suppose that even for single phase systems, it is believed that
µi [31, pg 83]. Indeed, for a single phase system, some have identiﬁed

To estimate the activity coeﬃcient of the LJ ﬂuid, one must refer to the

unit amount of substance i from the standard state condition of unit activity

3.4.1 On Helmholtz heat-work interchange

An approximate value for the multicomponent activity coeﬃcient may be de-
rived from the Helmholtz free energy for single systems by considering the work-
heat transformations. The single component Helmholtz free energy A is given
SdT implies
in standard form as A = U
that at constant T , the work done on the system dw is the so-called external
work (such as the P
V work connected with compression) where for ﬂuids,
dA =
P dV = dw. For ﬂuids, 3 basic categories ((i)-(iii))of compression from
state at concentration δc1 to c (where the lower concentration is at δc1) must
be examined as follows:

sub-parts are considered where (a) is generally applicable and is in the standard
format of a conventional thermodynamical system and (b) develops an inter-
nal potential description with control of the particle potential. For both cases,
divide the path into interval segments with states S indicated by subscripts :
S0(at δc1), S1, S2 . . . Sn(at c). For (b),we suppose that the external pressure P
of the imperfect gas obeys P
Pid, due to the repulsive intermolecular forces
relative to the perfect gas with pressure Pid for any concentration ci for state

of the theorem obtains and so a general path may be broken up into subsec-
tions with one or other of the inequalities obtaining (where it is assumed that

≥

the pressure is continuous over the path), implying the general validity of the
theorem. Method (a): Start with a perfect gas and compress reversibly to Sn.
At Sn, we ”‘charge up”’ the gas by introducing a potential with an interaction
parameter ǫ say. In Debye-Huckel theory of solution activity, where the charge
of the ions assumes the variable ǫ; in a LJ type potential system, a possible ǫ
. For any potential and
parameter for the potential µ(r) is µ(r) = ǫ
given particle coordinates, we can in principle compute the total potential of
interaction. For each particular value of ǫ we can calculate the mean energy of
interaction per unit increment of ǫ. Integrating this yields the average energy
of potential interaction as wfa . During this charging up process, heat energy
will be absorbed by the system of amount

the system is at a ﬁxed temperature T . For the entire compression process, the
total heat absorbed is

For the above, we have extended the scope of the traditional understanding of
the system as given to manipulation of the internal potential of force interac-
tions. This result may be stated thus:

Theorem 1 The heat absorbed by a system during an isothermal transition is
equivalent to that which is absorbed by an ideal system and the heat absorbed
when an intermolecular potential is introduced within the system.

Corollary 5 The reversible work performed during a system transition is that
due to the work for an equivalent ideal system and the potential energy change
due to intermolecular forces and therefore the excess work done relative to the
ideal ﬂuid is due to the intermolecular potential energy change of the system.

Proof. The ﬁrst part follows from δwc = δw + wfa from (82) and theorem 1,
and the second from δwc −

Corollary 7 The activity coeﬃcient for a single component system γi relative
to the standard state is given by γi = exp
Proof. Since δwc = kT ln γic
δc1
δAex = kT ln γi•
In the dimeric reaction 2A ⇋ A2, for lower A2 concentrations (lower ρ val-
ues), the limit γA,pure (pure phase)
γA,reaction, the activity coeﬃcient for the
reactive system A is exactly as for the single component ﬂuid because the force
ﬁelds acting on A are essentially the same as for the pure component, except
there would be clumps of A atoms held together by intermolecular harmonic
potential whenever A2 is present, but these internal forces do not aﬀect the
external forces acting on the A atom. This identiﬁcation and limit is used to
choose the general form of γ vs. ρ curve for atom and dimer, since the two diﬀer-
ent assumptions that are used leads in one case to semi-quantitative agreement
of γA for the reaction and γA,pure (pure phase), and it is therefore inferred that
the system conforms better to one of the two assumptions made to derive esti-
mates of the activity coeﬃcients. Clearly, only one of these must obtain from
the previous deduction (Corollary 3) concerning the uniqueness of the activity
coeﬃcient. We can infer that the results from Fig.(15) is the more consistent
one by referring to the monomer situation, for which some data exists, and
by estimating the monomer activity from the data and to then infer that the
form and trend provided for the monomer at lower concentrations should be
approximately that for our pure atomic species as deduced from readily avail-
able functions. These functions were estimated for values of temperature up to
T ∗ = 6.0 and therefore are not adequate for higher temperature estimations.
Nevertheless. even for T ∗ = 6.0, the values follow exactly the same trends as for
the results here at T ∗ = 8.0, including the activity estimates all much greater
than unity. The γ estimates are derived from eqn.(59) and the expression from
Corollary(7). It is clear from Fig.(10) that the activity estimates show values all
greater than unity. The system ρ for this ﬁgure and all others refer to ρsystem,
all in reduced units where ρsystem = ρA + 2ρA2, where ρA is the number density
for the monomer (Atom) and ρA2 refers to the dimer species number density in
this homogeneous system at equilibrium. Fig.(10) is computed for the situation
ρAtom = ρsystem.Since what is being depicted is the external potential work
done in bringing the atom to the system, then the forces acting on the atom
can arise from either the dimer or the atoms within the system, and since the
potentials are of the same LJ form for each nucleus, then we would expect this
density to be the most appropriate one. If we just consider what the activity

sion is plotted in the ﬁgure mentioned above where NA is the number of atoms

3.5 Considerations in Hamiltonian systems

Recently, it has been proved [34] that the Liouville theorem,and in particular
the Liouville space, of cardinal importance to both classical [35] and quantum-
mechanical theories of dynamics and statistical mechanics [36] does not obtain
typically in standard applications; and therefore that non-Hamiltonian theories
posited using Liouville space, such as developed by Tuckerman et al. are equally
suspect [34, Tuckerman et al. references within]. A work which does not im-
ply a steady state but a disintegrating system which preserves a certain form
of entropy had been described earlier without recourse to Liouville space and
operators, and which considers the Jacobian of a transformation [37]. ”’Non-
Hamiltonian”’ systems has been variously described, including their relation
to thermostatting using a pseudo-Hamiltonian that forces constant conditions

such as pressure or temperature [38]. It should be noted that many of the syn-
thetic thermostats were designed with the belief in the Liouville theorem. As
such, it would be expected that equilibrium properties might be computed if
the phase-space covered follows the canonical energy distribution for the coordi-
nates. However, if the cause of the canonical distribution is not due to a smooth
Hamiltonian trajectory, but to external random impulses, then it can be inferred
that the real time behavior of particles described by such pseudo- Hamiltonians
over any short enough time interval δt would not follow the prescribed pseudo-
Hamiltonian trajectory. Such an inference implies that the dynamical behavior
of the ensemble of particles would not correspond to the actual possible trajec-
tories with random perturbing forces. It then means that molecular simulation
with such pseudo-Hamiltonians would not yield realistic trajectories which could
explain real-time, non-averaged behavior over very short time intervals where
random impulsive forces were acting; in particular, biological system function
based on real time changes of coordinates cannot be accurately simulated by
such pseudo-Hamiltonians if their main mode of dynamics involves random per-
turbations,such as from a reservoir. Another presupposition concerns the static
nature of a Hamiltonian system [38, p.496] and the supposed eﬀects of ”‘walls”’
and constraints in the Hamiltonian: ”‘...The notion in phase space of Hamilto-
nian system is similar to that of an incompressible liquid; in time the volume of
the ”‘liquid”’ does not change. In contrast, a non-Hamiltonian system is com-
pressible. This compressibility must be taken into account when considering
the generalization of the Liouville equation to non-Hamiltonian systems”’. On
the other hand, from the work presented in [34],it may be inferred that for any
Hamiltonian form

one can consider the ”‘walls”’ and other physical constraints of the system as
perturbations to
HE where V (r) does not refer to the wall interactions; for per-
fectly reﬂecting walls, for instance, a micro-canonical distribution results, the
canonical one obtains for the single system. The system trajectory is Hamil-

or/and thermostat at time ti; here the walls and energy interchange achieves at
least two functions (i) it deﬁnes the boundary ∂C and (ii)acts as a thermostat in
terms of energy interchange and the change of system trajectory not determined
by the Hamiltonian. If the energy levels are quasi-continuous – which certainly
HE will be distributed with a canonical energy

HE according to standard statistical mechanical
theories [39, p.1-3]. For the Hamiltonian system given here, eqs.(3-6), the K.E.
proﬁle of (i) the ”‘Atom”’ is conﬁned to that segment of the potential curve
where there is no bonding, and (ii) the product A2 to the molecular potential
well, with (iii) the ”‘transition state”’ point located at two diﬀerent points rf
and rb. The coordinates of the deﬁned quantities (i-iii) are not in general the
canonical coordinates of the entire system Hamiltonian. These coordinates rep-
resent transient species and the energy terms for these coordinates may or may
not be canonical [8], and if they have a Canonical energy (CE) distribution- such
as the K.E. of the centre-of-mass of the dimer- then its apparent temperature
deﬁned as 3kTa
2 =< K.E.c.m. > need not correspond to Ts, the system temper-
ature. It was discovered [8] that the mean K.E. of the atom A and dimer about

the C.M. followed the C.E. distribution, with apparent temperatures slightly
diﬀering from Ts. This result is not unknown, since within a reacting system,
apparently diﬀerent temperatures have been experimentally detected [40] for
the diﬀerent species in a plasma. Gibbs and his equilibrium criterion suggests
that all species at equilibrium must have the same temperature; we observe that
experimentally this is not the case, where relative to the C.M., the temperature

against the interparticle force due to reactant Ai is derived from the kinetic en-
ergy of the particles at a particular geometrical locus determined by the impact
parameter and geometry of the potentials and the activation energy; all these
factors Ω are almost always considered invariant in Q.M./classical reaction rate
theories since they are strictly mechanical properties, so that k0

where it is conventionally assumed that Ts = Ti,o; for this model, the minimum
impact parameter is at rf = 0.85 with the activation energy at 17.5153. At
other concentrations, the reaction pathway system would have to be perturbed;
this situation is not normally considered even in advanced treatments [6]; the
perturbation suggested here are the energy levels of activation; there would be
other eﬀects, of ﬁrst and higher orders which perturbation theory can provide.
The object of the current work is to provide an outline of a theory with esti-
mates of the more important eﬀects which can account for Observation(2) and
Lemma(2). A second order eﬀect concerns the change of mean kinetic energy
of the molecules from the zero state δWi,K.E. (meaning the state as the density

0) where

but would not be considered further; obviously this perturbation would aﬀect
the number of activated atoms/molecules. The general perturbation is from a
reaction at zero density (almost always the form given in standard theories) with
rate constant k0
i (Ω, Ti,o) to that at any other density which is the actual
equilibrium state (a.e.s.) ki = ki(Ω, Ti(Ts)); i.e. a mapping from these two
states is required. In the ideal state formulation (for example SCT), absolutely
no other environmental interaction φe of particle/complex reactants i with j is
envisaged up to the collision distance σ. In the perturbed state, on the other
= 0, x = i, j for the coordinate rx of particle x. We
hand, for rij > σ, φe(rx)
note that for the vacuum state for which k0
i is deﬁned, φe = 0 for any particle
participating in the reaction. The work done δwi,ρ in transferring a particle i
from the standard state of zero density (identiﬁed with the rate constant k0
i ) to
a.e.s. is trivially

δwi,ρ = kT ln γi

(85)

with γi being the activity coeﬃcient. The concentration term corresponding to
the ideal external work does not feature since it is a common term for both the
ideal and non-ideal states. In (85), γ can be determined from MD by calculating
the mean potential φifor any system ρ, where γi = exp φi
kT . Standard MD gives
the same quantity by a particle insertion method [41, p.349, Appendix C] where

with Ut being the instantaneous potential of the test particle interacting with
other particles. An obvious generalization of eq.(83) involves writing a Hamil-
tonian of M primary particles with a boundary ∂C not incorporated into the
Hamiltonian in terms of a potential, with instantaneous energy Ei, which would
ﬂuctuate when it exchanges energy with the boundary which incorporates a heat

Although the Hamiltonian (87) is invariant in its form, the system ∂C deter-
mines the density of energy levels and the relative energy levels; by equipar-
tition, the average kinetic energy is invariant for all enclosed boundaries, but
the potential energy is not, since it is possible to set ∂C such that the inter-
molecular distance of particles i and j is
C and I could therefore arrange
a lower bound by suitable compression and choice of the boundary ∂C such
that V (r1, r2, ....ri....rM ) > B∂C . The Canonical distribution for the Hamilto-
nian would obtain if the degeneracy is very great, according to the principles
developed in the Feynman development[39]. Thus relative to the zero density
state, where the maximum
= 0, the
mean potential energy changes with the boundary (and therefore system den-
sity); further, the mean potential experienced by dimer and reactant atoms
would also diﬀer with density changes; hence relative to the zero density reac-
tion scheme, the additional potential energy present is available to overcome
the activation barrier of the reaction. The total available energy is δwi,ρ, and
for the ground state reactants, this energy would lower the apparent activation
energy, and will be used to parameterize the change in activation energy; it will
be noted that there might exist the possibility that not all this energy might
be utilized in extremely fast reactions where ”‘molecular chaos”’ and the ad-
justment of neighboring particles is not rapid enough for the full utilization of
this potential. Further investigations, both theoretical and experimental would
be required to elucidate these remarks. Hence a ﬂexible approach is required
to interpret the γ’s which may in some cases be a fraction f in value to the
thermodynamical γ; the results here indicate f

The proposed models for particle interactions yielding chemical reactions for
the forward (F) and backward (B) steps are given in Figs. (13-14)below.These
models enable one to calculate the activity coeﬃcients where one model con-
tradicts experimental observation whereas the other does not, in addition to
corroborating the deductions of the activity from thermodynamical functions.
The inverse Φ convention yields the activity coeﬃcients given in Fig.(15).
On the other hand, the non-inverse Φ convention yields results for the activity
coeﬃcient given in Fig.(16)

It is of interest to determine the activity coeﬃcients by direct calculations be-
cause the Kwong-Redlich and associated equations [42, p.29],[43] used to deter-
mine activity coeﬃcients for multicomponent mixtures are not easily extended
to chemical reactions: part of the diﬃculty is that the component concentrations

in their thermodynamical mixtures are free to vary independently, and may be
ﬁxed at any arbitrary value: this cannot obtain for reactive systems because
of the relational dependence of the components via the equilibrium constant,
and partial derivatives of thermodynamical quantities used to determine these
coeﬃcients demand free variation or ﬁxing of concentration terms that is not
realizable in a reactive system. Moreover there is the need to determine the
variation of c(ρ) over the entire system density because of its theoretical sig-
niﬁcance linking Φ and Φ′. The next section provides a broad methodology.
the exact methodology appears not to have been worked out but veriﬁcation of
the above would constitute another method of determining activity coeﬃcients
from rate measurements.

3.6 Models based on simulation results

The elementary rate constants have the form [44]

E
ki = A(T, Ω) exp −

(88)

where E is termed the activation energy and Ω are variables intrinsic to the
reaction, such as impact and structure parameters. The object here is to relate
the γ′ reactivity coeﬃcients to the γ availability (activity) coeﬃcient based on
(13-
the ﬁrst order single or two stage energy perturbation mechanism (Figs.

ducing a continuous potential ﬁeld along the entire length of the reaction path-
way. The object here is to present a broad framework where calculations to

any degree of accuracy might be attempted. For both these mechanisms, A∗2
and A∗ are the states of the reactants just prior to product formation. The
ﬁrst order perturbation lifts the degenaracy of the
levels relative to the vac-
uum state; in the vacuum state, no singularities are observed in the potentials.
Singularities due to the perturbation arises because the product and reactant
states are distinct and distinguishable, and need not have the same activity in
general; the form factor A(T, Ω) is not altered to ﬁrst order since they specify
the type of reaction; only E is altered due to the external potential that modi-
ﬁes the ground state energies of the particles relative to the vacuum level. The
availability coeﬃcient γX is expressed as

∗

ǫX
kT

= ln γX

(89)

for any species X, and the excitation energy is written δB for species B.For
what follows, ǫ always refer to an energy term associated with the activity
or availability coeﬃcient. In the single stage model, the upper X ∗ species is
perturbed by an absolute energy amount given by γX ∗ in (89); for the double
stage model,the upper level is perturbed by the relative energy ∆E0
,2, due
{
to the singularity induced by the change of state from product to reactant or
vice-versa. The lower state for both models are perturbed (lessened) by the
same factor γX since this is the ground state availability .
It will be shown
that the 2-stage relative model is the more accurate and logical, based on a
comparison with estimates of the activity coeﬃcient for the monomer or atom

or δAb.δAb = δA2,in. In view of the fact that the product/reactant potential

stated as a kinetic principle:

Principle 1 The perturbed energy required to promote reactants to products
at the reactant/product potential interface is of the same magnitude as for the
reverse transition of products to reactants at the product/reactant potential in-
terface, even if these interfaces are discontinuous, i.e. are spatially and ener-
getically distinct, for elementary reactions in equilibrium.

Fig. (1) shows that for this study the interfaces are distinct;”’reversible”’ path-
ways have coincident interfaces.

3.6.1 Two stage backward reaction model

In view of (94) we can write the exact form

γ′A =

γ′A2 =

γA
√γA2, out
γA2
γA2, out

(95)

(96)

If a complete characterization of the γA2 species were known, then γA2, out could
be calculated from the theory presented in Sec. (3.3.1) especially expressions
(39). Some estimates or approximations may be made to determine the γ’s.
The reaction pathway for this 2 stage backward step model may be written

Reactants(a)

T.S. products(c)

(97)

→

→

When considered in isolation, (normal vacuum state analysis), there is continu-
ity of the potentials between states (b) and (c) in (97). On the other hand, if the
environment is considered where species are either reactants or products, singu-
larities in the energetics would develop about the same arbitrary volume of the
T S of the reaction coordinate; for instance at (b), two atoms in proximity A...A
are separated by distance δrA,A and the mean activity of this state is strongly in-
ﬂuenced by the potential V (δrA,A) dependent on the δrA,A distance, in addition
to the surrounding non-participatory environmental molecules V ′(rothers). On
the other hand, at the same vicinity (c) where the switch modiﬁes the potentials,
then the activity of the instantaneously formed molecule would be determined
by V ′(rothers), where V (δrA,A) now represents the potential of internal coordi-
nates not connected to the activity. An apparent discontinuity arises according
to this ﬁrst order treatment, which has no apparent analog in the traditional or
other QM theories computed at vacuum densities. For the two stage reaction,
two types of approximations for activity coeﬃcients may be made for the for-
ward (F) 2A
2A kinetic pathways and the results
may be checked with the apparent activity coeﬃcient values derived from the
LJ single phase ﬂuid.

where γAb ≈

tive ǫ’s in the numerator of (99). Fig. (14) can be correlated with (97) as follows:
E0
B,1 is the activation energy to the level A∗2, which consists of two degenerate
states relative to the vacuum denoted T S(b) with molecule A2, and T S(c) which
refers to the two atoms 2A after dissociation; in real time the molecule disin-
(c) according to (97). Unlike
tegrates along the trajectory (a)A2 →
the atom, the dimer state may be characterized according to the inter particle
A
A, (as well as the magnitude of the external potential). The
mean external forces acting on this dimer would lead to a potential which is
to a ﬁrst approximation relatively invariant, even if the internal potential and
internuclear distance varies; thus we assign ǫ(A2(a))
ǫ(A2(T S, b) . The po-
tential energy is utilized to overcome the activation barrier; the boundary ∂C
imposes a ﬁxed density on the system which elevates the mean potential of the
reactants relative to the vacuum ground state. During the transition to the
state T S(b), external forces with a mean potential ǫ(A2(T S) would operate on
the dimer; rb = 1.20 for this reaction, where for a b.c.c. approximation for a LJ
ﬂuid at ρ = 0.70, the approximate nearest neighbor distance is 1.22, implying
that the environment of A(T S) is very close to that of the bulk or generic A
atom, i.e. a typical atom with activity coeﬃcient γA, so that the transition
state A2 availability coeﬃcient for the atom γA,T S can be equated with the

Energy estimates given in Figures(10-12), especially Fig. (10). The other two
ﬁgures were plotted to show that the coeﬃcient estimates are all greater than
unity (> 1). As expected from the theory provided, the activity coeﬃcients
from the Ares function show semi-quantitative agreement with the simulation
results. The other Ares functions which eliminate the dimer contribution shows
markedly lower values; we would expect a slight lowering of value due to dimer
interference, leading to the conclusion that simulation results with the above
two models are plausible, and that Ares is the more appropriate function to
use for estimation. Since the adjacent atom in the dimer cannot contribute to
the potential energy of the dimer contributing to its activity, one would expect
its coeﬃcient to be lower. The (B) reaction above has its counterpart in the
forward (F) reaction, but because the transition state atomic activity coeﬃcient
is severely aﬀected by its own force acting on the other target atom, it would
not be reasonable to assume that the activity coeﬃcient at that T S state due
to the particle potentials can be equated with the bulk activity, especially when
the internuclear distance at rf = 0.85 corresponding to an energy of over 17.0
LJ units! However it would be instructive to follow through the consequences
of this approach so that comparisons with the activity coeﬃcients derived from
the literature may be made.

coeﬃcients is given in Fig. (16) where γA, γA2 < 1, which contradicts the results
of the free energy estimates given in Figs. (10-12), especially Fig. (10); this was
to be expected from the assumptions made for state A∗. Since δA2,out can be
determined from the more reliable (B) process, we might be able to derive an
estimate for γ∗Aγ∗A for the (A...A) T S state of two atoms about to dimerize where
the (B) process assignment is used for the determination. We would expect γ∗Aγ∗A
to change relatively much more slowly compared to the γA and γA2 variations
over the system ρ if the activity coeﬃcient is strongly inﬂuenced by the isolated
large repulsive potential of the two atoms at the T S region. Evidence in this
direction would serve as a prototype for describing ionic reactions along the
classical ideas of Br¨onsted and Bjerrum.

γA as before for (B) (2 stage process). Then from Φ = Φ′ we get γ′A ≈

have γ′Aγ′A = γAγA
and
from (96) there results γ′A2 ≈

absolute single-stage process are not expected although they seem to conform
to the Br¨onsted-Bjerrum (B-B) form (where the z’s are the associated charges)

Clearly, some demonstration of the relative constancy of γAza ...γBzb would be
re-assuring. Obviously the potentials for the present dimer model and that of
ionic reactions are diﬀerent, but we can show a relative constancy for the analo-
gous T S atomic pair, and so can expect a similar relative constancy to obtain for
ionic reactions. We return to the previous system of eq.(108) where γAza ...γBzb

4 Conclusion

The current form of the elementary reaction rate constant is still incomplete
despite the depth and complexity of analysis valid for relatively low density sys-
tems due to the utilization of traditional deﬁnitions and conventions. A more
complete description would involve the ”‘reactivity”’ coeﬃcients and these coef-
ﬁcients are intimately related to the activity coeﬃcients of the species involved
in the reaction. Under stipulated conditions, such as obtain for the two stage
model, explicit ﬁrst order expressions may be derived connecting the reactivity
and activity coeﬃcients. A whole range of product and reactant states exists,
and under an enumeration scheme incorporating the Gibbs equilibrium condi-
tion, one particular state may be determined from another through a series of
equations which also feature the bulk activity coeﬃcients. The theory of ionic
reactions as developed by Br¨onsted and Bjerrum may be subsumed by the sim-
ple ﬁrst order models provided here using a strictly elementary reactive process;
in particular these models can also explain apparent violations of the standard
Br¨onsted-Bjerrum theory involving composite reactions. The framework given
here can be extended to other more complex particle reactions which are mod-
erated by strong external ﬁelds, such as what might obtain in the plasma state.

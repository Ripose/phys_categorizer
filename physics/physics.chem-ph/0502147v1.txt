Long-range charge transfer excited states are notoriously badly underestimated in time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT). We resolve how exact TDDFT captures charge transfer between
open-shell species:
in particular the role of the step in the ground-state potential, and the severe
frequency-dependence of the exchange-correlation kernel. An expression for the latter is derived,
that becomes exact in the limit that the charge-transfer excitations are well-separated from other
excitations. The exchange-correlation kernel has the task of undoing the static correlation in the
ground state introduced by the step, in order to accurately recover the physical charge-transfer
states.

I.

INTRODUCTION

How or whether excited states of long-range charge
transfer character are captured in time-dependent den-
sity functional theory (TDDFT) has recently received
much attention [1–9], partly because of its importance
in systems of biological and chemical interest. Many
of these molecules are big enough that traditional wave-
function methods to calculate excited states become pro-
hibitively expensive; TDDFT, on the other hand, scales
favorably with the number of electrons, while remaining
reliably accurate for many excitations. There is therefore
much interest in applying TDDFT to such systems, and
understanding why, when, and where it is expected to
work well.

TDDFT is an exact theory, based on the mapping
of the interacting electronic system to a non-interacting
one [10], far faster to solve.
In practise the unknown
time-dependent exchange-correlation potential must be
approximated, introducing errors in excitation energies.
These are not always well-understood, although there
has been some recent progress [11], for example in the
signiﬁcance of the asymptotic behaviour of the poten-
tial [12, 13], and in the severe frequency-dependence
needed for double-excitations [14–16]).

It has been found [1–9],

that excitations involv-
ing charge-transfer (CT) between widely separated
species within a molecule are severely underestimated in
TDDFT. This is in contrast to most excitations, which
are accurate to within a few tenths of an electron-volt.
This has serious consequences. For example [3], predic-
tion of CT quenching of ﬂuorescence in light-harvesting
bacteria, contrary to observation.

There have been several recent attempts to overcome
this charge-transfer problem. In Ref. [8], a ∆SCF cor-
rection is made, while in Ref. [1], it is proposed that
TDDFT be mixed with conﬁguration interaction singles.

In Ref. [9], a long-range correction using Hartree-Fock is
implemented. Ref. [2] suggests a simple improvement by
shifting the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO energies
based on the derivative discontinuity [17]. Ref. [4], on
the other hand, remains purely within TDDFT, and sug-
gests an empirical asymptotically-corrected kernel that
diverges with separation.

In the present paper, we also stay strictly within
TDDFT, and ask, in contrast to all other approaches,
what is the exact TDDFT description of charge-transfer
in one simple case: charge-transfer between two open
shell species, when the charge transfer states are well-
separated from the other excitations of the system. By
solving a simple model we deduce what the exchange-
correlation kernel must be in this case.

An important feature of the present analysis involves
the step in the exact ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) po-
tential that appears between two widely-separated open
shell species of diﬀerent ionization potentials. This step
is also present in orbital approximations such as exact
exchange (or the KLI approximation to it [18]). It is not
present in local or semi-local gradient approximations:
so our model for the exact exchange-correlation kernel
does not apply to these cases. Our purpose here is to ex-
plore how charge-transfer is described exactly in a simple
model case.

We begin in Section II with a review of TDDFT lin-
ear response theory, and present the problem of long-
range charge transfer. A simple model to study this is
introduced in section III. We describe the signiﬁcance
of the step that develops in the KS potential when a
(closed-shell) molecule composed of two diﬀerent open-
shell species are pulled apart. The KS ground-state is of
a fundamentally diﬀerent nature than the true ground-
state, resembling the problems of homonuclear disso-
ciation; the KS charge-transfer energies become zero!
We show how inclusion of the electron-electron interac-
tion breaks the degeneracy and yields the correct nature
of the ground-state and the CT states.
In section IV
we describe the implication of static correlation for the
TDDFT exchange-correlation kernel, and derive a model

for it that is valid in the limit that the charge-transfer
excitations are well-separated from all other excitations
in the system. The features are strong-frequency depen-
dence and exponential dependence on the separation of
the two species. Finally, in section V, we discuss other
ways that static correlation haunts TDDFT, so far unex-
plored.

II. TDDFT LINEAR RESPONSE AND CT

We begin by brieﬂy reviewing the TDDFT linear re-

sponse formalism.

Although the density of the KS system is deﬁned to
be that of the interacting system, the excitation ener-
gies are not the same:
linear response theory tells us
how to correct them. Applying a small perturbing po-
tential to a ground-state, and measuring the density re-
sponse deﬁnes the susceptibility, or density-density re-
sponse function, χ[n0](r, r′, t
t′) = δvext(rt)/δn(r′t′)
n0 .

The susceptibility of the true interacting system is related
to that of its non-interacting Kohn-Sham counterpart,
χS[n0](r, r′, t
t′) = δvS(rt)/δn(r′t′)
n0 , through an inte-

Here the Hartree-exchange-correlation kernel is the sum

tential, fXC[n0](r, r′, t
sition frequencies of the true system lie at the poles of
χ(r, r′, ω), and oscillator strengths may be obtained from
the residues. The poles of χS(r, r′, ω) are at the KS sin-
gle excitations; these are shifted to the true excitations
through the action of the Hartree-exchange-correlation
kernel. So, Eq. (1) enables us to obtain the interacting
excitation energies and oscillator strengths from the KS
susceptibility and the Hartree-exchange-correlation ker-
nel. In principle, the exact spectrum of the interacting
system is obtained; in practise, approximations must be
made for (a) the xc contribution to the ground-state KS
potential, and (b) the xc kernel fXC(ω).

When the coupling between excitations is very small,
one may neglect the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the matrix,
producing the “small-matrix approximation” [11, 21, 22]:

This is equivalent to keeping only the backward and for-
ward transitions at frequency ωq in the Lehman repre-
sentation of the response function. When the shift from
the KS transition is small, one may simplify this further
to get the “single-pole approximation” [19]:

ω = ωq + 2[q

Now, consider applying the theory to long-range
charge-transfer excited states. In the limit of large sepa-

where ID is the ionization energy of the donor, and AA

Refs. [1, 2], the failure of TDDFT to reproduce this is
evident from a single-pole analysis (Eq. (6)), where

of the donor (KS orbital energy ǫH

the acceptor (KS orbital energy ǫL
A). Because there is
exponentially small overlap between the atomic orbitals
on the widely separated donor and acceptor, the integral
term vanishes, and the TDDFT energy collapses to the
bare KS energy, as indicated in the second line. We have
used the fact that the KS HOMO energy is exactly the
negative of the ionization energy, but the LUMO energy
diﬀers from the negative aﬃnity by the discontinuity [17,
23–25]:

Now, common approximations underestimate I, but how
does exact TDDFT get the exact energy? That is, sup-
pose we had the exact ground-state Kohn-Sham potential
and also the exact exchange-correlation kernel. Then the
exact TDDFT HOMO energy is indeed ID, but how does
the exact TDDFT retrieve the discontinuity AXC, and the
1/R Coulomb fall-oﬀ? We address this in the next two

sections.

III. CT BETWEEN TWO OPEN SHELL
SPECIES: THE ROLE OF STATIC
CORRELATION

To study this question, we consider ﬁrst the simplest
model: electron transfer between two one-electron neu-
tral “atoms”, separated by a large distance R. Let I1(2)
be the ionization energy of atom 1(2); then the atomic
orbital occupied in the ground-state has energy ǫH =
I1(2), where the H subscript stands for HOMO of the
−
atom. When we consider the closed-shell molecule com-
posed of the two atoms at large separation, the ground-
state KS potential develops a step between the atoms,
that exactly lines up the atomic HOMOs [23, 26]. To see
this, consider the Kohn-Sham wavefunction Φ0 for the
molecule. This is the doubly-occupied bonding orbital:

separation, φ1,2 denotes the occupied atomic orbital of
atom 1(2). Inserting φ0 into the KS equation, while rec-
ognizing that near each atom, the orbital must reduce to
that atom’s atomic HOMO, with the appropriate orbital
energy, one sees that the exchange-correlation potential
between the atoms;
I2 −
must develop a step of size
|
raising the potential of the atom with the larger ioniza-
tion energy. A simple 1-d example is given in Fig. 1 where
each “atomic nucleus” is an Eckart potential. The poten-
tial eventually goes back down to zero on the right-hand-
side. (A similar picture for two delta-function “nuclei”
can be found in Ref. [23]). The step renders the HOMOs
of each atom degenerate, and is necessary to prevent dis-
sociation into fractionally charged species [17].
If they
were not exactly lined up, then one could lower the en-
ergy of the system by transferring a fraction of charge
from one of the atoms to the other, contradicting the
charge neutrality that is observed in nature. This phe-
nomenon is closely related to the derivative discontinuity
discovered in the 80’s [17, 23–26].
It is important to
note that the step is present in exact DFT and is ap-
proximated in spatially-nonlocal approximations such as
exact-exchange [18, 27] Most common approximate po-
tentials, such as LDA, garner only local or semi-local
density information, and so do not display the step.

The fact that in exact DFT the atomic HOMO’s be-
come degenerate has an apparently drastic consequence

for CT excited states: Whereas a (semi-)local DFT ap-
proximation would yield a ﬁnite KS transition energy,
albeit underestimated, the exact KS system yields zero
energy for charge transfer between the atoms!

The Kohn-Sham energies are poor because,

in this
case, the KS description is fundamentally diﬀerent from
the interacting system. The KS ground-state involves
each electron delocalized over both atoms, whereas the
true wavefunction has one atom on each. We shall come
back to this point shortly.

The alignment of the atomic HOMO’s leads to three
nearly degenerate singlet two-electron KS states, whose
spatial parts are:

splitting from the electron-electron interaction, and that
the basis of the three states, Eqs. (11), has negligible
couplings to all other KS excitations. To simplify the
discussion, we choose I2 > I1. Diagonalizing the true

Thus, the correct nature of the ground-state, and CT
states with the correct form of energy (c.f. Eq. 7), in-
cluding an approximation for the exchange-correlation
contribution to the electron aﬃnity, are recovered.

(15)

In a sense, accounting for the electron-interaction un-
does the static correlation in the system. Because of the
step in the potential, and the consequent nearly degener-
ate triple of KS determinants, the ground-state problem
resembles the well-known homonuclear dissociation prob-
lems of ground-state DFT [28, 29], where the dissociation
limit is incorrect because the KS ground-state involves
mixing ionic combinations into the true neutral Heitler-
London form. Static correlation was an important agent
above in treating the perturbation: The Hamiltonian can
always be written in terms of the KS Hamiltonian HS, as
vXC. For any two-electron sys-

tem, as we have here, vX =
O(λ), where λ is
the interaction strength. Typically the correlation poten-
tial is O(λ2), appearing at the next order of interaction
strength, but when there is static correlation, it is much
stronger: vC cancels vH + vX and adds the step, yielding

This must be so in order for the KS equation for the
molecular orbital φ0 to reduce to that for the atomic
orbital φ1,2, respectively, near atom 1 and atom 2.
We discuss how static correlation aﬀects the exchange-
correlation kernel of TDDFT in the next section.

We now consider the approximate result for AXC,
Eq. (14). The derivation neglected all KS states ex-

This result for AXC is consistent with a perturbative

E(N + 1). Consider adding one elec-
tron to an N = 1-species. In an unrelaxed approxima-
tion, the extra electron plops into the same spatial orbital
as the ﬁrst. A perturbative approximation for the elec-
tron aﬃnity is obtained from calculating the diﬀerence
in the Hamiltonians of the 2-electron and 1-electron sys-
tem, in the unrelaxed doubly-occupied orbital. One ﬁnds
exactly the result, Eq. (14).

Although our results so far have been derived for
it
charge transfer between two one-electron species,
is straightforward to show that they hold for charge-
transfer between two general open-shell species. There
the KS molecular HOMO sits atop a spin-paired KS de-
terminant, containing all the inner orbitals of both atoms.
So far, we have examined the exact ground-state KS
potential for a closed shell molecule composed of two
open-shell species, and found that the step in between the
species leads to a near zero value for charge-transfer in

the Kohn-Sham system. We showed that the static corre-
lation is broken by the electron-electron interaction, and
how the latter allows us to recapture the true ground-
state and excited charge-transfer states, together with
an approximation for the exchange-correlation electron
aﬃnity.

IV. THE EXCHANGE-CORRELATION
KERNEL FOR CHARGE-TRANSFER

How does the static correlation in the ground-state
aﬀect the TDDFT description of charge-transfer?
In
TDDFT, the exchange-correlation kernel must play the
role of the diagonalization of the previous section in sal-
vaging the CT energies from their near zero KS value.
We now examine what the nature of the exact fXC must
be, and the signatures of static correlation in the kernel.
Consider the KS response function, χS(r, r′, ω). We

may write this as

Now we turn to the interacting response function,
χ(r, r′, ω), which is a sum over all excitations of the in-

Again the response function vanishes exponentially with
separation, but this time because the CT transitions have
exponentially weak oscillator strength due to overlap be-
in the orbital
tween widely separated spatial regions:

We note that we are retaining backward transitions in
the expressions above: these are “small-matrix approxi-
mations” rather than “single-pole approximations” that
include only the forward transition. The latter is not
valid here because the antibonding transition frequency is
very small: the backward transition is of almost the same
magnitude as the forward, so should not be neglected.
The single-pole approximation is only valid when the
shift from the KS energy is small [11]: here, the shift
is the entire CT energy, since the KS transition energy is
near zero (i.e. exponentially small in the separation).

As we saw in the diagonalization procedure, the CT
transitions of the interacting system arise from the KS
subspace of bonding and antibonding orbitals.
In the
diagonalization procedure, the number of states was pre-
served: the three KS 2-electron singlet molecular deter-
minants of Eq. (11), composed of the bonding and anti-
bonding orbitals, were rotated by the electron-electron
interaction into the Heitler-London ground-state and CT
states onto each of the two atoms. The picture is some-
what diﬀerent in the response functions. Here the space
is of excitations out of the ground-state, so in the inter-
acting case there are two (one to each CT state). But
the KS response function has only the single-excitation
Φq of Eq. (11)): double excita-
(corresponding to Φ0 →
tions cannot appear in the KS response function because
the numerator involves the one-body density operator,
which connects only states diﬀering in one orbital (see
also Ref. [14]). It is the job of the exchange-correlation
kernel, fXC to generate an extra pole, and also to mix
them. Speciﬁcally,

and where ωav = (ω1 +ω2)/2. This, with ω1 and ω2 given
by Eqs. (13), (14),and (15), gives the exact exchange-
correlation kernel matrix element in terms of KS quanti-
ties, in the limit that the charge-transfer states are iso-
lated from the other transitions, in that coupling to them

can be neglected. Notice the strong non-adiabaticity in
the exact kernel, manifest by the pole in the denominator
on the right-hand-side.

In the usual presentations of the TDDFT charge-
transfer problem, the failure is due to the vanishing over-
lap between the occupied orbital, on one atom, and the
unoccupied one on the other atom, widely separated.
This means that q = φiφa vanishes exponentially with
separation. This does not occur in the exact analysis
of CT between open shells presented here: here the oc-
cupied orbital is the bonding orbital and the unoccu-
pied is the anti-bonding orbital, so their overlap goes as
(φ2
2)/2 where φ1 is the atom 1’s HOMO (or LUMO)
and φ2 is atom 2’s HOMO (or LUMO). Although the
overlap remains ﬁnite, the matrix element [q
q] di-
verges exponentially with interatomic separation R, as
1/¯ω, as can be seen from Eq. (21).

A divergence of fHXC-matrix elements has previously
been found in H2 dissociation [29], where the the lowest
singlet-singlet KS transition energy vanishes with sepa-
ration, while the true energy approaches a ﬁnite num-
ber; the step in the KS potential for our heteroatomic
molecules leads to a similar feature raising its head again
here, but now with the kernel being strongly frequency-
dependent. Also, the CT treatment in Ref. [4] utilized an
empirically determined kernel that displays also exponen-
tially large behaviour as a function of atomic separation.

V. DISCUSSION AND OTHER IMPLICATIONS
OF STATIC CORRELATION

By considering electron transfer between two one-
electron species at long-range, we investigated how
charge-transfer is captured in the exact KS system. The
bare KS energies for CT approach zero exponentially
with the separation of the species, but including the
electron-electron interaction, splits the near-degeneracy
and recaptures ﬁnite CT energies of the correct form.
We derived the form of the TDDFT exchange-correlation
kernel, Eq. (21), that becomes exact in the limit that the

6

charge-transfer states are isolated from all the other ex-
citations in the system. The main features of the kernel
are (i) a strong frequency-dependence, due to the mixing
in of the double excitation to the antibonding KS state,
and (ii) a dependence on the inverse tunnel splitting be-
tween the two species, that goes exponentially with their
separation.

A crucial feature of the exact KS system in this paper is
the step between the two widely separated species. This
gives rise to static correlation in the ground-state, and
hence the strong frequency-dependence and exponential-
dependence on the atomic separation of the fXC matrix el-
ement, discussed above. Not only does it play a vital role
in the description of CT states, but it also has very inter-
esting, and unexplored, eﬀects on other excitations of a
long-range heteroatomic molecule. For example, higher
atomic excitations become KS resonances, as illustrated
in Figure 1. Here two one-dimensional “Eckart atoms”
are shown: the second excited state of the atom on the
right can tunnel out of the barrier presented by the step.
The acrobatics the exchange-correlation kernel must per-
form in order to turn such a resonance back into a bound
state of the true system, will be pursued in future work.

Another interesting consequence of the step is that for
every single excitation out of the HOMO bonding orbital,
φa, there is a nearly degenerate double-excitation,
φ0 →
( ¯φ, φa), where the other electron occupying
(φ0, φ0)
the HOMO is excited to the antibonding orbital, sepa-
rated in energy only by the tunnel-splitting. Doubles are
absent in the KS response [14], but they are essential in
this case for a correct prediction of the nature and energy
of the interacting state: for example, it is needed to lead
to a charge-neutral excited state on each atom [31]. The
presence of double excitations immediately leads to poles
in the frequency-dependence of the exchange-correlation
kernel [14]; the static correlation implies the poles are
ubiquitous and will be investigated in future work.

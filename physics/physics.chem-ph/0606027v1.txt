We present the (cid:28)rst rigorous study of atom - moleule ollisions in superimposed eletri and

magneti (cid:28)elds and show that dynamis of eletroni spin relaxation in moleules at temperatures

below 0.5 K an be manipulated by varying the strength and the relative orientation of the applied

(cid:28)elds. The mehanism of eletri (cid:28)eld ontrol of Zeeman transitions is based on an intriate in-

terplay between intramoleular spin-rotation ouplings and moleule-(cid:28)eld interations. We suggest

that eletri (cid:28)elds an a(cid:27)et hemial reations through induing nonadiabati spin transitions and

failitate evaporative ooling of moleules in a magneti trap.

Our results lead us to propose several new mehanisms

for ontrolling moleular ollisions and, possibly, hem-

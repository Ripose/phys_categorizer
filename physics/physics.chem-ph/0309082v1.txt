Abstract

We present a mechanism able to show intrinsic bistable behaviour involving single
Y b3+ ions embedded into bromide lattices, in which intrinsic optical bistability
(IOB) has been observed. The mechanism is based on the experimentally found
coupling between the Y b3+ ion and the totally symmetric local mode of vibration
of the [Y bBr6]3− coordination unit. The model reproduces the IOB observed in
CsCdBr3 : 1 % Y b3+ and allows to understand the experimentally found presence
of the phenomenon in the other bromides, but its absence in Cs3Lu2Cl9 : Y b3+.

IOB, Y b3+, electron-phonon interaction

A physical system without mirrors of an external cavity, exhibiting two stable
outputs for a single input intensity of an exciting laser, is said to exhibit in-
trinsic optical bistability (IOB) [1,2,3]. Hehlen et al. [4,5,6,7] have discovered
that Y b3+ - doped Cs3X2Br9 [X = Y, Lu] and CsCdBr3 show IOB when
2 F5/2(2′) electronic
exciting into the 2F7/2(0)
transitions of the Y b3+ ion with a narrow band laser of suitable near-infrared
(NIR) frequency. On the contrary, no IOB was observed under excitation into
2 F5/2(1′) transition [8,9]. When doped in these crystalline bro-
the 2F7/2(0)
Y b3+ dimers
mide materials some Y b3+ ions form strongly interacting Y b3+

2 F5/2(0′) and 2F7/2(0)

2 F5/2 transi-
[10,11]. Due to this interaction, excitation of the Y b3+ 2F7/2
tion (around 10000 cm−1) results in both, 2F5/2
2 F7/2 emission of single
→
Y b3+ ions in the NIR spectral range, as well as Y b3+
Y b3+ dimer emission
in the visible (VIS) at twice the resonance frequency of the single Y b3+ ion
[6,12,13] through a cooperative luminescence mechanism [14]. The IOB phe-
nomenon consists of a temperature and excitation power dependent hysteretic
behaviour of the transmitted, NIR and upconverted VIS emission intensity
(with the system switching output intensity at two critical incident excitation
powers). To date, it is discussed if the phenomenon is due to the presence of
strongly interacting Y b3+
Y b3+ dimers or if it is a single Y b3+ ion prop-
erty. The theories relying on the former interpretation are usually referred to
as “dimeric”while those supporting the latter idea as “monomeric”. Dimeric
theories substantially rely on the existence of intra-pair electronic coupling of
Y b3+
Y b3+ dimers [4,5,15,16]. According to these theories, IOB should be
observed a fortiori in Y b3+ - doped Cs3Lu2Cl9, as this material is isostruc-
tural to Y b3+ - doped Cs3X2Br9 [X = Y, Lu] [17,18] and exhibits a stronger
electronic exchange interaction for Y b3+
Y b3+ dimers [10]. However, no ex-
perimental evidence for IOB was found in Y b3+-doped Cs3Lu2Cl9 [8,9]. Fur-
thermore, in Cs3X2Br9 : Y b3+ (X = Y, Lu) only a few Y b3+ ions form dimers
at low concentration of impurity ions. Nevertheless, both bromide lattices ex-
hibit IOB even at a low Y b3+ - doping level [4,5,6]. A monomeric mechanism
to account for IOB in these systems has been proposed by Gamelin et al. [9]
who presented a phenomenological model, according to which IOB depends
on a single - Y b3+ ion property in these materials. In this model, IOB is at-
tributed to the interplay of a laser heating eﬀect and a strongly increasing,
non-linear dependence of the material’s absorbance with the internal temper-
ature. With its phenomenological nature, this theory succeeds in reproducing
many experimental trends, but does not provide the microscopic mechanism
of IOB. In this letter, we present the ﬁrst microscopic, monomeric mechanism
that allows a single active ion to exhibit all essential aspects observed in IOB.
To date, the microscopic theories presented in literature describing how a col-
lection of two-level atoms can exhibit IOB are based on electronic coupling
between two or more near absorbers [3,5,15,19]. In these cases, the electronic
interaction between the coupled absorbers provides the feedback loop required
to obtain intrinsic bistability. Together with the intrinsic two-level atom non
linearity and the use of single-atom density matrix approach (an indispens-
able step in order to obtain non linear equations), this feedback loop gives
rise to inversion dependent atomic resonance frequency renormalization, and
thus possible IOB. With a few exceptions, the role played by the host lattice,
and in particular of the ﬁrst coordination sphere of the Y b3+, in the mecha-
nism responsible for IOB in Y b3+-doped bromide host materials has generally
been regarded as secondary. However, Hehlen et al. measured diﬀerent inter-
nal temperatures for the system on the two branches of the hysteresis loop
[5]. This suggests that with the ﬁrst switch occurring, the lattice undergoes
heating. Additionally, L¨uthi [8] has found that Cs3Lu2Br9 : 10% Y b3+ shows

2

−

bistable behaviour even when excited with a chopped laser and oﬀ-times as
long as 75 msec. This means that the system prepared on the upper branch
of the bistability region does not decay to the lower branch for times as long
as 75 msec after turning oﬀ the exciting laser beam. If IOB were due to a
cooperative mechanism based on electronic Y b3+
Y b3+ coupling, and the
feedback loop provided by the same two ytterbium ions, it would be hard to
justify this behavior. After 75 msec, all ions in their excited state are expected
to have decayed to the ground state, and there seems to be no physical reason
for the system to save memory of its past history. The fact that the nuclear re-
laxation times of the lattice are much longer than the electronic ones, suggests
that the lattice nuclear degrees of freedom play a relevant role in the bista-
bility mechanism. Supported by the ﬁndings of a Raman spectroscopy study
on CsCdBr3 : 1% Y b3+ [20] showing strong coupling between the electronic
2 F5/2(2′) transition of Y b3+ and the totally symmetric vibrational
2F7/2(0)
local mode of the [Y bBr6]3− coordination unit (into which Y b3+ is embedded
in all bromide lattices showing IOB), we propose that this vibrational cou-
pling provides the indispensable feedback loop to observe IOB (involving only
a single Y b3+ ion).

Our physical system consists of the electronic structure of a single Y b3+ ion
and the totally symmetric vibrational local mode A1g of the [Y bBr6]3− octa-
a
ground and
and
hedron. We treat the former as a two-level system (

= σij i, j = a, b) and
j

|
i h
the latter as a quantum harmonic oscillator (a and a+ annihilation and cre-
ation operators, respectively, and angular frequency ωk). We write the free
Hamiltonian H0 of the system as

b

|

|

H0 = HY b + Hk = ¯hω0 σbb + ¯hωk a+a

For the interaction Hamiltonian VY b−k between the ion and the A1g local
mode we choose a bilinear operatorial form (in order for the oscillation centre
to depend on the electronic state in which the ion is [21])

VY b−k = ǫ (σbb −

σaa) (a + a+)

When a coherent classical electromagnetic ﬁeld is applied to the ion, using
the rotating wave and the electric dipole approximations, the coupling be-
tween the Y b3+ ion and the external ﬁeld is described by the observable
2 (σbae−iωt + σabeiωt), where Ω and ω stand for the Rabi and the
VY b−L = ¯hΩ
laser frequency. Denoting the total Hamiltonian operator of the system with
H = H0 + VY b−k + VY b−L, and taking into account both the ion spontaneous
emission and the dissipative interaction of the ion and the local mode with
the bulk modes of the lattice (described by a suitable superoperator S), the

where F is the density operator of the whole system. F (t) can be written as
F (t) = T rkF (t) T rY bF (t) + F Y b−k(t), where T rkF and T rY bF are the reduced
density operators of the ion and the local mode, respectively, while F Y b−k(t)
represents the correlations existing at the time t between Y b and k. Assuming
VY b−k ≪
F (t)

H0, we approximate F (t) with its factorized part

T rkF (t) T rY bF (t)

This is the main hypothesis of our model. In this way, analogously to other
theories [3,5,19,22], we assume that single-ion density matrix approach is al-
lowed. A necessary condition for this approach to be valid is that VY b−k is much
smaller than the free Hamiltonian H0 (later on we will show this is the case).
It must be remarked that the feasibility of this treatment - indispensable to
have non linear equations and thus possible IOB - poses a delicate and lively
debated [15,23,24] theoretical problem questioning even the existence of a mi-
croscopic explanation of some IOB phenomena [23]. We justify assumption
(4) with the ability of our model to reproduce the observed IOB phenomena.
Inserting eq.(4) in eq.(3) and doing the trace over k and Y b, we obtain two
coupled master equations in T rkF (t) and T rY bF (t). Performing the variable
change ρ′
ab = ρab eiωt, it can be proved that the ion dynamic equations in ˙ρbb
and ˙ρ′
ab diﬀer from the usual optical Bloch equations in the rotating frame for
the presence of an eﬀective resonance frequency ωef f
(t),
linearly dependent on the mean value of the local mode operator (a + a+).
This proves that the dynamic response of the ion to the applied ﬁeld depends
on the state of the local mode (in its turn depending on the ion state). It is easy
to show that for stationary conditions (when setting all temporal derivatives
to zero) the resonance frequency can be written as

with γ being the relaxation rate of the local mode. We thus ﬁnd that the overall
eﬀect of the coupling between the electronic transition of the Y b3+ ion and the
A1g local mode of the [Y bBr6]3− unit, consists of an ion resonance frequency
ρaa). Introducing the

This provides a threshold value of the local mode - Y b3+ ion interaction
strength required to observe intrinsic bistability compatibly with our micro-
scopic feedback mechanism. Moreover, eq.(7) shows that, for an increasing
value of the bistability parameter β/Γh, the incident power bistability range
moves toward higher values of P and, in addition, becomes wider. We now use
our theory to reproduce the two incident powers at which switching occurs
measured in CsCdBr3 : 1 % Y b3+ [7]. Guillot-No¨el et al. successfully per-
formed an analogous simulation to test their dimeric theory [15]. In our study
we use: δ = 0 (perfect resonance), ω0 = 10602.8 cm−1 [7], Γh = 0.6 cm−1 [7],
10−4s [13], Fab = 10−6 and, additionally, we take cos2ϕ = 1/2,
1/Γ1 = 7.8
assuming that the incident laser beam is unpolarized [5]. Using the bistability
parameter to optimise our simulation, good agreement is achieved between
the theoretical prediction and the experimentally measured values [7] for the
two incident powers at which switching occurs, as shown in Fig. 1. Using the
optimised value of β/Γh = 7.5, the ion-local mode coupling constant ǫ [eq.(2)]
can be estimated. From eq.(6) and taking into account the fact that the lat-
tice nuclear relaxation times are typically very long compared to 1/ωk, we
2 √β ωk. With ωk = 191 cm−1 [20], we obtain ǫ = 14.66 cm−1 for

is much weaker than H0. With this value for ǫ, the displacement of the oscil-
lation centre for the local mode k, for an Y b3+ ion undergoing the transition
, as implied by the operatorial form assumed for VY b−k [eq.(2)],
from
turns out to be in the order of 1 % . This result agrees with typical values
found for lattice point defects due to incorporation of rare earth impurity ions
[21], and conﬁrms that the coupling constant ǫ we get from our model is of
the correct order of magnitude.

Another relevant test for our theory is its ability to predict the presence of
IOB in Cs3X2Br9 : Y b3+ [X = Y, Lu], but the absence of the phenomenon in
Cs3Lu2Cl9 : Y b3+ [8,9]. In the bromide compounds, the angular frequency ωk
is 190 cm−1 [12], similar to the one found in Cs3Er2Br9 [25]. From comparison
of the absorption and emission spectra, we estimate Γh and ǫ to be comparable
to the ones measured in CsCdBr3 : Y b3+ [8,20]. These assumptions made, we
expect the bistability parameter β/Γh for Cs3X2Br9 : Y b3+ [X = Y, Lu] to
have a comparable value to the one calculated for CsCdBr3 : 1% Y b3+, and
can understand why IOB is found in the former compounds. For the chloride,
ωk is 285 cm−1 [25]. From inspection of the absorption and emission spectra,
0.7 cm−1 [8], and the Y b3+ - A1g
we estimate Γh to fall in the range 0.3

to be lower than the critical threshold of 3√3/2 required for IOB. We ﬁnally
notice that absorption spectra of Cs3Lu2Br9 : Y b3+ show that the Y b3+ ion

In summary, we have presented the ﬁrst microscopic mechanism according
to which a single Y b3+ ion is able to exhibit IOB when doped in Cs3X2Br9
[X = Y, Lu] or CsCdBr3. The mechanism couples the electronic two-level
system of the Y b3+ ion with the totally symmetric local mode of the vibration
of the [Y bBr6]3− coordination unit. The theory has been used to reproduce
basic aspects of the IOB observed in CsCdBr3 : 1% Y b3+. We emphasize
that our theory not only allows to understand, why IOB has been observed
in CsCdBr3 : 1% Y b3+ and Cs3X2Br9 [X = Y, Lu], but also, why it is
absent in the chloride compound Cs3Lu2Cl9 : Y b3+. These results provide
new insight into the microscopic mechanism underlying the IOB phenomenon
and guidelines for expanding the material basis in the search for IOB systems,
and their potential applications.

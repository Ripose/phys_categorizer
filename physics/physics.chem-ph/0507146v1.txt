Density functional theoretical (DFT) study for the prediction of spectroscopic
parameters of ClCCCN.

DFT and RHF level calculations in conjunction with three diﬀerent of basis sets have been used
to investigate the variations in the bond lengths, dipole moment and rotational constants, IR
frequencies, IR intensities and rotational invariants of ClCCCN. The nuclear quadrupole constants
of chlorine and nitrogen of ClCCCN have been calculated on the experimental rs structure as well as
on the B3PW91/6-311++g(d,p) optimized geometry and are found to be within the scale length of
the experimental uncertainty. Linear regression analysis between the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level
calculated and experimental Bo values have been achieved for ClCCCN and BrCCCN. The slopes
and intercepts obtained from the regression analysis were used to calculate the reasonable values
of rotational constants of all the rare isotopic species of ClCCCN and BrCCCN as well having
standard deviations ±0.048 MHz and ±0.015 MHz respectively. All the spectroscopic parameters
obtained from DFT calculation shows satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum chemical calculation and spectroscopic char-
acterization of organic compounds, free radicals, radical
anions etc. have found considerable amount of interest
in recent years1,2,3,4. Accurate and eﬃcient calculation
of spectroscopic constants for a wide range of molecu-
lar systems employs readily available methods and ba-
sis sets5,6. The DFT method has been demonstrated
to have great accuracy in reproducing the experimen-
tal values of quadrupole hyperﬁne coupling constants7,
molecular structural properties8, rotational constants1,4,
IR frequencies and intensities9,10,11 etc.
to within 8-
10%. DFT studies have been carried out for many halo-
gen derivatives of acetylenic compounds like BrCCCN12,
FC8H13, ClCN14 etc. and benzene derivatives like o-
benzyne4, 3-chlorobenzonitrile15 etc. to calculate their
accurate spectroscopic parameters. Highest number of
the polyatomic molecules identiﬁed in space are mostly
carbon chains16,17, the longest chain identiﬁed so far is
HC11N18.
Identiﬁcation and characterization of these
species could have been made by their previously re-
ported known spectroscopic parameters. Spectroscopic
studies of the related series of molecules containing halo-
gens have been extensively studied19,20,21,22. Recently,
we have investigated the variations of the spectroscopic
parameters of bromocyanoacetylene (BrCCCN) at the
HF-SCF and DFT levels in conjunction with a variety
of basis sets12.
It was found from the the investiga-
tion that DFT-B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level calculation
is satisfactory in the prediction of bond lengths and rota-
tional constants etc. of BrCCCN when compared against
their experimental values. However, to my knowledge,
a detailed quantum chemical calculations and molecu-
lar properties of chlorocyanoacetylene (ClCCCN) is very
limited. Recently, ClCCCN has been produced by electri-
cal glow discharge23 and the analysis is underway in the
millimeter-wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum .
Analysis of the microwave spectra of ClCCCN has been

reported by T. Bjorvatten24.
Infrared studies of ClC-
CCN have been reported by S.J. Cyvin et.al25. Later on,
P. Klaboe et. al26,27 have reported the Raman spectral
analysis and revised their vibrational assignments in the
region 100-4000 cm−1.

In this study, the results of DFT (B3LYP, B3PW91)
level calculations of optimized molecular geometry, rota-
tional constants, quadrupole coupling constants, IR fun-
damental frequencies, IR intensities and rotational in-
variants of ClCCCN are compared against the available
experimental data and reported. Linear regression anal-
ysis between the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level calculated
and experimental Bo values have been made for a reason-
able prediction of rotational constants of all the other 22
rare isotopomers of ClCCCN. Due to the lack of quan-
titative data on the IR intensities in the literature, the
rotational invariants28,29,30 of ClCCCN have been pre-
dicted and discussed here may be helpful in future for
the experimental IR spectroscopist for interpreting IR
intensities of this molecule. Satisfactory agreements be-
tween the calculated and available experimental values of
spectroscopic parameters have been found at the B3LYP
level and compared with the corresponding values calcu-
lated at B3PW91, RHF and MP2 levels of theory. As
an extension to our previous work12, the linear regres-
sion analysis between the calculated and experimental
Bo values of BrCCCN have been achieved at the same
level for the accurate prediction of rotational constants
of the other 22 rare isotopomers, which may be helpful
for future studies of the rotational spectra of the rare
isotopomers of ClCCCN. In addition, a test of the opti-
mization followed by a frequency calculation at the MP2
level in conjunction with a medium size basis set 6-31G
or/and 6-311++g(d,p) predicts two negative frequencies
(saddle point of oder two) corresponding to the -C≡C-Cl
doubly degenerate bending mode (ν7) and thus it was
diﬃcult to calculate the harmonic frequencies of these
modes under Cv point group symmetry.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS AND
CALCULATIONS

Geometry optimization and quantum chemical calcula-
tions were carried out at the restricted HF-SCF method,
MP2 method and Density Functional Theoretical (DFT)
method under Cv point group symmetry. The hybrid
HF/DFT methods used were Becke’s three-parameter
method31 with Lee-Yang-Parr correlation (B3LYP),
Becke’s three parameter exchange with Perdew-Wang
Correlation32 (B3PW91) and Becke’s one-parameter
method with Lee-Yang-Parr correlation (B1LYP)33,34.
Five diﬀerent basis sets used during the analysis were
Dunnings correlation consistent polarized valence double
and triple zeta basis sets aug-cc-PVNZ (N = D, T)35
augmented with a d function, Ahlriches TZV(3df,2p)36
and triple split zeta qualities 6-311++g(d,p) and 6-
functions.
311+g(df,pd) augmented with p, d and f
Tight convergence in stead of default convergence
criteria was used with ultraﬁne integration grid for the
calculation of normal mode frequencies. All calculations
were carried out by the Gaussian03 suite program
package37.

The physical quantities ¯pα, βα and χα are invariant
with respect to the rotation of space-ﬁxed coordinate
axes which are known as generalized atomic polar tensor
charge (GAPT), atomic anisotropy and Kings atomic
eﬀective charge of αth atom respectively and are useful
for interpreting infrared intensities. The components of
the (3×3) atomic polar tensor matrix P (α)
X are deﬁned
as the ﬁrst derivatives of the components of molecular
dipole moment with respect to the atomic Cartesian
displacement co-ordinates of each atom α (=Cl, C and
N) of ClCCCN given by:

proportional to µ/I
were directly calculated by Gaussian03 package.

On the other hand, nuclear quadrupole coupling
constants (NQCCs) of chlorine and nitrogen of ClCCCN
are calculated by using the electric ﬁeld gradients
(EFGs). The elements of the NQCC tensors χij are
related to those of the EFG tensors qij by :

χij = (eQ/h)qij

where e is the fundamental electronic charge, h is
Plank’s constant and i, j = a, b, c are the principal axes
of the inertia tensor.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Optimization of geometry for each molecule at the
restricted HF-SCF and DFT levels were performed in
the ground state by single point energy calculation.
In each case, stationary points were found and linear
geometry of ClCCCN and BrCCCN were conﬁrmed.
Finally, we performed a frequency calculation following
each optimization in order to check for the existence of a
true minimum and to conﬁrm an equilibrium structure.
A test of geometry optimization followed by a frequency
calculation under Cv point group symmetry at the MP2
level in conjunction with 6-31g or/and 6-311++g(d,p)
basis sets succeeded in locating a stationary point but
with two imaginary frequencies (IMAG = 2) correspond-
ing to the -C≡C-Cl doubly degenerate bending mode.
This conﬁrms that the stationary point located by the
MP2 level of theory is not a true minimum rather a
saddle point of order two on the potential energy surface
of ClCCCN which may cause a large deformation to
the geometry of the molecule. Similar features have
also been reported elsewhere40.
So the scan of the
potential energy surface should be emphasized in order
to characterize the the nature of the saddle point on
the potential energy surface of ClCCCN and to check

(1.2093(43)), 1.3700(23) (1.3680(21)), 1.1607(10) (1.1596(10)) for Cl-C, C≡C, C-C, C≡N of 35 (and 37) species of ClCCCN
respectively.

any possible existance of conical intersection between
the ground and ﬁrst excited state. However, the DFT
and HF-SCF level calculations were not able predict any
imaginary frequencies implying that the stationary point
is located at the global minimum of the potential energy
hyper-surface. The results of our calculation for bond
lengths of ClCCCN are summarized in Table 1. The
experimental rs-structural values24 are also given for
comparison. As can be seen from Table 1, the HF-SCF
level calculations highly overestimates Cl-C and C-C
bond lengths and underestimates C≡C and C≡N bond
lengths, whereas these values calculated at the MP2 level
overestimates all these bond lengths when compared
against their experimental values. However, the results
of DFT-B3LYP, B3PW91 method in conjunction with
6-311++g(d,p) basis set are in rather pleasing agreement
with the experimental rs values. Here, We note a slight
overestimation of Cl-C bond length and an underestima-
tion of C≡C and C≡N bond lengths, diﬀerences between
calculated values and the average rs values in bond
lengths for ClCCCN are 0.0077 ˚A, -0.0026 ˚A, -0.0043 ˚A
and -0.001 ˚A for Cl-C, C≡C, C-C and C≡N respectively
at the B3LYP level, whereas a slight underestimation of
all these bond distances being noticed at the B3PW91
level of theory, diﬀerences are -0.0013 ˚A, -0.0017 ˚A,
-0.0058 ˚A, -0.0007 ˚A for Cl-C, C≡C, C-C and C≡N

summarized in Table 1,

respectively. A comparison of bond lengths calculated
at various levels,
indicate
that convergence has not achieved on improving the
size of the basis sets 6-311++g(d,p) to aug-cc-PVTZ.
However, a better comparison is made on the over-all
(end-over-end) length , rCl...N , of the molecule which is
much less sensitive to the experimental and theoretical
uncertainty. The average value of this length at the
B3LYP level in conjunction with 6-311++g(d,p) basis
set is calculated to be 5.3625 ˚A which diﬀers from
the average experimental value by a factor of 0.0002
˚A . Thus,
it is to say that the over-all rs-structure
is a good approximation to the over-all bond length
at the correlated level B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) within,
say, 0.001 ˚A , which is mostly under the statistical
uncertainties.

Interestingly, our B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level opti-
mized geometry leads to satisfactory values of rotational
constants of ClCCCN and BrCCCN shown in Table 3
and 4 respectively. The experimental values are also
given for comparison. Rotational constants calculated
at B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level are a little higher, (0.02
%) in case of ClCCCN and (0.03 %) in case of BrCCCN,
than the experimental Bo values of all the 10 diﬀerent
isotopomers of both the species, whereas these values
calculated in conjunction with other basis sets are far

oﬀ (summarized in Table 1). Thus, the agreement
between the theoretical prediction and experimental
observation of rotational constants clearly indicates
that
the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) optimized average
geometry, shown in Fig 1, is realistic and advocates for a
decent predictive power of the computational procedure
applied to ClCCCN and BrCCCN, though diﬀerences
are more than the error limits for the re structures.
Based on the linear regression analysis, shown in Figures
2, between the calculated and experimental B values,

rotational constants of other 22 rare isotopomers of each
of ClCCCN as well as BrCCCN have been predicted
accurately having standard deviations ±0.048 MHz and
±0.015 MHz respectively. A closer look at the Table 1
indicates that the HF-SCF wave functions predict dipole
moments of ClCCCN close to its experimental value,
deviation being 0.4 D where as the DFT wave functions
overestimates it by a factor of 0.72 D irrespective of the
basis sets used. Zero point vibrational eﬀects are not
taken into consideration in all these calculations.

4.57 MHz (6.09 %) and 0.94 MHz (1.5 %) for 35Cl and
37Cl respectively. These deviations are signiﬁcantly due
to the largest error ±4 MHz and ±3 MHz present in
the measurement of the quadrupole hyperﬁne structures
of 35Cl and 37Cl of ClCCCN, though the calculated
values are within the scale length of experimental
uncertainties. A comparison of NQCCs of Chlorine
calculated on the B3PW91/6-311++g(d,p) geometry
as well as on the rs structure reveals an almost similar
value, which is basically due to the similar C-Cl and
C≡N bond lengths, whereas its value calculated on
the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) optimized geometry is a bit
oﬀ as expected since NQCC varies linearly with C-Cl
bond length and thus the C-Cl bond lengths should be
emphasized in the determination of accurate quadrupole
hyperﬁne structures of both species chlorine of ClCCCN.
A comparison with ClCN14 shows an underestimation
in the value of NQCC, which being supported by a
decrease of C-Cl bond length, the decrease being within
5%. On the other hand, the nuclear quadrupole coupling
constants of 14N of ClCCCN are also summarized in
Table 2. As can be seen, the values of NQCCs of 14N
are very similar to each other since the rs structure as
well as the optimized B3LYP, B3PW91/6-311++g(d,p)
C≡N structures are predicted to be very similar. A com-
parison with the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants
of 14N of FCCCN7, HCCCN and DCCCN41 with that
of ClCCCN reveals a similar C≡N structure resulting
a similar value of NQCC. Thus, the accurate values of
NQCCs of 35Cl, 37Cl and 14N are those derived from
the rs structures. Variations of NQCCs of 35Cl and N of
calculated directly by various levels are also summarized
in Table 1.

ClCCCN has, in principle, ten fundamental modes.
These modes under the Cv point group symmetry are
distributed among four vibrations of Σ+ species and six
vibrations of Π species, out of which three Π species are
doubly degenerate. Thus, the vibrational assignments
of ClCCCN reported by the co-authors25,26,27 comprises
seven fundamental modes ν1 , ν2, ν3, ν4, ν5, ν6 and
ν7 which is in consistent with the HF and DFT level
calculations. All the normal modes are calculated to
be Raman active. Harmonic frequencies have been
calculated at the RHF and DFT levels in conjunction
with three diﬀerent basis sets with increasing size
in solution (benzene) as well as in vapour phase are
summarized in Table 6. Experimental values are also
included for comparison. All the predicted vibrational
spectra have no imaginary frequency, implying that the
optimized geometry is locating at the global minimum
of the potential energy hyper-surface for both the
methods. Frequencies calculated at the Hartree-Fock
level contain known systematic errors due to the neglect
of electron correlation and the choice of the basis sets,
resulting an overestimation of 10-12 %. Therefore, it
is usual to scale stretching frequencies predicted at the
HF-SCF level by an emperical factor 0.893, which has

FIG. 2: Comparison between the calculated (B3LYP/6-
311++g(d,p)) and experimental rotational constants of ClC-
CCN and BrCCCN. The slopes and intercepts obtained
from the linear regression analysis are 0.99907, 1.02283 and
1.00046, -0.72358 for ClCCCN and BrCCCN respectively.

The nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (NQCCs)
of 35Cl, 37Cl and 14N of ClCCCN, NQCC being pro-
portional to the the electric ﬁeld gradient (EFG), are
calculated by using equation (8). Calculation of EFGs
being made on the rs-structures24 as well as B3LYP
and B3PW91/6-311++g(d,p) optimized geometries of
ClCCCN. The methods, basis sets and procedures7 used
during the calculation were B3PW91/6-311+g(df,pd)
for nitrogen and B1LYP/TZV(3df,2p)
for chlorine
respectively. The coeﬃcients (eQ/h)ef f. in equation (8),
obtained from the linear regression analysis between
the calculated EFGs and experimental NQCCs for a
series of molecules containing chlorine and nitrogen, are
reported7 to be 4.5586(40) MHz/a.u., -19.185 MHz/a.u.

The values of NQCCs
calculated on the B3LYP, B3PW91/6-311++g(d,p)

been demonstrated to reproduce experimental values to
a high degree accuracy for a wide range of systems43.
However, the improvement of the quality of the unscaled
normal mode frequencies is signiﬁcant in going from
the non-correlated to the correlated level of theory
and enlarging the size of the basis sets at the cost
of its computational expanse. A comparison of the
experimental values against the resulting IR normal
mode frequencies calculated at the B3LYP level leads to
a largest error with 6-311++g(d,p) basis set is 32 cm−1,
with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set the largest error is 16
cm−1 whereas with aug-cc-pVTZ the largest error is 18
cm−1. An unexpected change of the ν6 fundamental
frequency has been noticed both at the B3LYP and
B3PW91 levels of calculation when 6-311++g(d,p)
results being compared against the aug-cc-PVNZ (N =
D, T) results indicating that this mode is sensitive to
the size of the basis sets used. The values of ν1, ν2,
ν3, ν4 and ν5 computed at B3LYP/aug-cc-PVDZ are
overestimated from their respective experimental values

by 85.18 cm−1, 49.80 cm−1, 25.19cm−1, 13.77 cm−1,
13.24 cm−1, whereas ν6 and ν7 are underestimated
by a factor of 21.42 cm−1 and 7.
45 cm−1. These
discrepancies can be corrected either by computing
an-harmonic force constants or introducing a scaled
ﬁeld or directly scaling the calculated wave-numbers by
taking the ratio between the calculated and observed
frequencies for a particular type of motion. B3LYP
scaling factor for stretching modes are all close to 0.965
published elsewhere46. On the other hand, the normal
mode frequencies calculated at the DFT-B3PW91 level
of theory slightly overestimated from the DFT-B3LYP
values, diﬀerences, for example, being 2.9, 2, 1.3, 8.8,
15.6, 9.3 and 13.6 cm−1 for ν7...and ν1 respectively in
conjunction with aug-cc-pVDZ basis set, whereas this
overestimation is highly signiﬁcant for stretching and
bending modes computed at the HF level of theory,
diﬀerences being 20.9, 86.2, 84.7, 23.6, 36.2, 235.1 and
269.7 cm−1 respectively. A comparison of the normal
mode frequencies calculated in benzene with those

in vapour phase values at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ
indicates a shift of C≡N stretching frequency towards
the high wavelength region as expected whereas for
other modes the shift is rather small which being in
good agreement with the experimental shifts. On the
other hand, a frequency calculation at the MP2 level in
conjunction with a medium size basis set 6-311++g(d,p),
presented in Table 6, predicts two negative frequencies
(saddle point of oder two) corresponding to the -C≡C-Cl
doubly degenerate bending mode (ν7) and thus it was
diﬃcult to calculate the harmonic frequencies of these
modes at this level.

The infrared band intensities Ii, on the other hand, of
ClCCCN corresponding to the seven vibrational modes
ν1, ν2, ν3, ν4, ν5, ν6 and ν7 were assigned experimentally
in gas phase as well as in solution (benzene)26,27 to be
very strong, strong, very week, weak, strong, medium
strong, and very weak respectively. The calculated in-
tensities are summarized in Table 7. As can be seen, the
most intense absorption infrared band (I1) corresponds
to the C≡N normal mode as expected irrespective of
the methods and basis sets used, variation in intensity is
within 30 km/mole between the two (HF-SCF and DFT)
theoretical methods. For the band I2, the diﬀerences
between the RHF and B3LYP values in intensity are
within 20 km/mole. Out of the three doubly degenerate
bending modes, intensities of I6 and I5 corresponding
to the normal modes ν5 and ν6 are calculated to be of
equal in magnitude which were experimentally assigned
to be medium strong and strong respectively. As shown
in Table 4, the main discrepancy in intensity is found for
the ≡C-C≡ stretching band I3. For this band, intensities
calculated at the RHF level deviates by a factor of 13
km/mol from the DFT values. A comparison of IR
intensities calculated at B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level of
theory in benzene and those in vapour phase indicates a
signiﬁcant enhancement of C≡N stretching intensity as
expected, since intensities measured in solutions some-
what larger than the gas phase intensities10, whereas for
other bands the change is very less. Thus, the agreement
between the calculated and the experimental gauss
treatment in intensities, is far from being quantitative.
Since there is no quantitative experimental data on
IR intensity measurements for all these bands, no
satisfactory interpretation could have possible. However,
a direct calculation of the dipole moment derivative
with respect to the normal co-ordinates can serve the
purpose. For, one makes the use of APT analysis that
permits the interpretation of IR intensities by means
of mean atomic charges ( ¯pα), the mass-weighted square
2
eﬀective charges ( χ
) , where mα and χα are the mass
α
mα
and eﬀective charge of each atom α of ClCCCN, since
all these invariants are related to each other by the well
known relation known as as G-sum rule44 given by:
Pα Iα =
− Ω, where symbols have their usual
Pα
meaning. Therefore, it permit a direct calculation of
atomic polar charges.

FIG. 3: Normal modes of ClCCCN. Atomic numbering is
shown in Figure 1. The modes corresponding to ν5 − ν7 are
repeated twice since these are doubly degenerate. The ac-
tual directions of vibrations of the doubly degenerate bending
modes were out of (shown as up) and into (shown as down)
the paper which being modiﬁed here for a clear visualization
of these modes.

The mean atomic charges as well as the rotational
invariants derived from the atomic polar tensors (APTs)
using equations (1) to (5) for all the ﬁve atoms of the
ClCCCN are summarized in Table 5. The atomic polar
charges ¯pα represent the redistribution of the electric
charge density around each atom in such a way that
their sum over all atoms equal to to zero in the molec-
ular bonding environment of ClCCCN at its optimized
equilibrium geometry. An important diﬀerence between
APT charges and the Mullikan charges45,46 is that the
basis-set dependence of the former arises only from the
fact that the basis set can be incomplete; hence, as the
basis set approaches completeness, the APT charges
approach a well-deﬁned limit47. A test with ClCCCN,
shown in Table 6, clearly indicates that GAPTs are
almost invariant with respect to the basis sets. The polar
tensor elements are almost all negative for nitrogen atom
as expected since nitrogen is the most electronegative
element, contrast to the carbon atom (C4) attached
to it through a triple bond character which is highly
positive, resulting the mean dipole moment of nitrogen
as negative and that of carbon as positive, each of which
can be interpreted as carrying a little more than -0.35
e and +0.35 e. This results in an unequal distribution
of charges among the two carbon atoms, with some
negative charge located on the carbon atom (C3) bonded
to C4 and an almost equal amount of positive charge on
the other carbon atom C2, leading to an interpretation
that the carbon atoms C and C carries atomic charges

a little more than +0.25e and -0.25e respectively. The
average values of atomic polar charges calculated by
all the methods are -0.146e, 0.396e, -0.251e, 0.366e and
-0.365e having standard deviations ±0.013e, ±0.001e,
±0.0.016e, ±0.032e and ±0.024e for Cl, C, C, C, N of
ClCCCN respectively which indicates an overestimation
of standard deviations of C4 and N arises mainly due
to pzz component of the atomic polar tensors of C and
N. It is noted worthy that all other invariant quantities
well are within 0.1e whereas a larger variation in the
value of anisotropy parameter β as well as in the value
of undeformability of charge ( ¯P /β) on the atom α of
ClCCCN as shown in Table 5.

The Mulliken atomic charges, on the other hand, of
chlorine and carbon attached each other by means of
a single bond are predicted to be positive in conjunc-
tion with 6-311++g(d,p) basis set by all the methods,
whereas these are predicted to be negative in conjunction
with aug-cc-pVNZ (N = D, T) basis sets. Similarly,
the charge of carbon atom attached to the nitrogen
atom through a triple bond character is predicted to be
negative irrespective of the methods and basis sets used.
However,
it successfully predicted a real sign to the
nitrogen atom as expected. As can be seen, variations
of these charges with respect to all the methods as a
function of basis set choice is rather large, variations

-0.898e to 0.101e, 1.155e to
being -0.208e to 0.51e,
1.985e,
-0.387e to -2.154e and -0.117e to 0.454e for
Cl, C, C, C and N of ClCCCN respectively, whereas
APT charges are less variable. A comparison of APT
charges with the Mulliken atomic charges indicates
that the APT charges are highly reliable than the
Mulliken atomic charges and the Mulliken population
analysis of atomic charge densities of ClCCCN does not
reﬂect the physical and chemical characteristics of this
system under consideration. Finally, a comparison of
the Mulliken atomic charges with the eﬀective charges
(χ), shown in Table 5, of Chlorine(Cl), C2, C4 and N5
increases as M q diminishes, which leads to an interpre-
tation that χ is dominated by the stretching intensities48.

IV. CONCLUSION

All the spectroscopic constants were calculated at the
restricted HF-SCF as well as DFT (B3LYP, B3PW91)
levels in conjunction with a variety of basis sets. Satisfac-
tory agreements between the B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) and
experimental values were found for rotational constants
of ClCCCN and BrCCCN as well. Over-all, rCl...N , bond
distance is a good approximation to the over-all bond
distance at the correlated B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p) level

of theory. The values of chlorine and nitrogen NQCCs
have been obtained with the B1LYP/TZV(3df,3p) and
B3LYP/6-311++g(df,pd) levels respectively on the rs
structure as well as on the B3PW91/6-311++g(d,p) op-
timized geometry are well within the scale length of ex-
perimental uncertainty. Enlarging basis sets size could
improve the calculation accuracy and satisfactorily repro-
duced the experimental bending mode frequencies with-
out being scaled with uniform scaling factors, though the
stretching frequencies are a bit oﬀ. The rotational in-
variants have been satisfactorily explained at these lev-
els of theory. The stationary point found on the poten-
tial energy surface of ClCCCN calculated at the MP2/6-
311++g(d,p) level of theory is not a true minimum rather
a saddle point of order two and thus scan of the potential
energy surface should be emphasized in oder to determine
the nature of the saddle point and verify any possible ex-
istence of conical intersection between the ground and
ﬁrst excited state.

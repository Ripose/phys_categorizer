Abstract

The crystal structures of potassium and cesium bistriﬂuoroacetates were determined
at room temperature and at 20 K and 14 K, respectively, with the single crystal
neutron diﬀraction technique. The crystals belong to the I2/a and A2/a monoclinic
space groups, respectively, and there is no visible phase transition. For both crystals,
the triﬂuoroacetate entities form dimers linked by very short hydrogen bonds lying
across a centre of inversion. Any proton disorder or double minimum potential can
be rejected. The inelastic neutron scattering spectral proﬁles in the OH stretching
region between 500 and 1000 cm−1 previously published [Fillaux and Tomkinson,
Chem. Phys. 158 (1991) 113] are reanalyzed. The best ﬁtting potential has the
major characteristics already reported for potassium hydrogen maleate [Fillaux et
al. Chem. Phys. 244 (1999) 387]. It is composed of a narrow well containing the
ground state and a shallow upper part corresponding to dissociation of the hydrogen
bond.

Introduction

B, it is widely accepted that the potential en-
In most of hydrogen bonds AH
ergy for the motion of the hydrogen atom has two minima [1–5]. For symmetric
systems A
A, the two wells can be equivalent and proton tunnelling may
occur. For the shortest hydrogen bonds the distance between the two minima
decreases and the potential barrier between them may disappear [6]. There
remains only a single well at the centre and such symmetric structures can
be regarded as “intermediate-states” for proton transfer in chemical reactions
or biological processes [7,8]. Our motivation for the studies of the title com-
pounds reported below is to shed light on the potential function experienced
by protons involved in strong symmetric hydrogen bonds.

H

· · ·

· · ·

A classic example of a symmetric intramolecular hydrogen bond is the mono-
anion of maleic acid in potassium hydrogen maleate, KH(OOC-CH=CH-COO).
O bond, with length Ro···o = 2.437 ˚A and with
This extremely short O
the proton located at the centre, has been studied with diﬀerent techniques:
X-ray diﬀraction [9,10]; infrared and Raman [11–15] and inelastic neutron
scattering (INS) [16–18]. More recently, the shape of the potential function
for the proton motion along the hydrogen bond has been determined from
neutron diﬀraction and INS spectra of single crystals at low temperature [19].
This potential is composed of a sharp well at the centre of the hydrogen bond
1000 cm−1 above the central minimum. These
and two secondary minima at
≈
0.8 ˚A from the centre. Upon the assump-
secondary minima are located at
tion that these secondary minima occur because the hydrogen bond geometry
is no longer stable after excitation of the ν OH mode above 500 cm−1, it
could be concluded that whilst the ground state wave function is “hydrogen-
bonding” the excited vibrational states are “hydrogen-nonbonding”. The po-
tential shape is a snapshot of the proton motion during the dissociation of
the hydrogen bond upon excitation of the OH stretching mode. The appar-
ent paradox of a modest dissociation energy threshold observed in one of the
“strongest” known hydrogen bonds was ascribed to partial compensation of
the energy of formation of the hydrogen bond by a strain energy arising from
the planarity of the maleate ring. This potential function was criticized by
Wilson et al. [20] on the basis of plane-wave DFT calculations. However, such
calculations performed over a very limited range of proton displacement, cor-
responding to potential energy far below the ground state, are not conclusive
[21].

≈ ±

So far, potassium hydrogen maleate is the only reported example we are aware
of this unforeseen potential shape and whether this system is unique or if simi-
lar potentials also apply to other strong symmetric hydrogen bonds is an open
question. By contrast, a totally diﬀerent potential shape has been proposed
for potassium and cesium hydrogen bistriﬂuoroacetates, KH(CF3COO)2 and

3

CsH(CF3COO)2, which are also classic examples of strong and symmetric hy-
drogen bonds at room temperature [6] with lengths Ro···o = 2.435 and 2.38 ˚A,
respectively [22]. The vibrational spectra of these salts have been thoroughly
investigated [23]. Upon comparison of infrared, Raman and INS spectra, the
800 cm−1 (ν OH), 1300
vibrational modes for protons were assigned at
cm−1 (γ OH) and 1600 cm−1 (δ OH). For both systems, the ν OH band pro-
ﬁles observed with INS and in the infrared are almost identical. They show
700, 800 and
complex multi-component proﬁles with main components at
880 cm−1 and weaker components in the range 500-1000 cm−1. These proﬁles
were regarded as mainly due to Evans-type [24,25] or Fano-type [26] interac-
tions with internal modes of the CF3COO entities. For the Cs derivative, a
90 cm−1 was tentatively assigned
very sharp intense INS band observed at
to proton tunnelling along the OH stretching coordinate and an asymmet-
ric double minimum potential was proposed, quite at variance to the case of
potassium hydrogen maleate.

≈

≈

≈

However, with hindsight, such a double well is rather unlikely for very short
0.5 ˚A oﬀ centre (see Fig. 7
hydrogen bonds because the minima located at
in Ref. [23]) are quite incompatible with the Ro···o length. The O—H distance
less than 0.7 ˚A is quite unrealistic. In addition, there is no evidence of ν
OH tunnelling transition for the K derivative, whereas band proﬁles, crystal
structures and hydrogen bond lengths are very similar.

≈ ±

The localization of the proton in an asymmetric double well is also in con-
ﬂict with the known crystal structure determined with X-ray diﬀraction [22]:
hydrogen bonds are centrosymmetric for the two salts at room temperature.
However, crystal structures at low temperature are unknown and a symmetry
breakdown cannot be excluded. In order to determine the proton location we
have used the single crystal neutron diﬀraction technique. The crystal struc-
tures of the two salts at 20 K or 14 K and at 298 K (room temperature) are
presented below. In both systems, hydrogen bonds are symmetrical at any
temperature, with protons clearly located at the centre. It is shown that po-
tential functions largely inspired by that of potassium hydrogen maleate, but
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, account for the OH stretching INS band proﬁles.

1 Crystal structures

Single crystals were obtained by slow recrystallization from aqueous solutions.
These very hygroscopic colorless crystals were handled under dry atmosphere.
For neutron diﬀraction measurements, approximately cubic samples (3
3
mm3) were cut from large crystals and tested at room temperature. Samples
were loaded into aluminum containers that were then mounted in a cryostat.
For measurements at low temperature, they were cooled down with a ﬂow of

×

helium vapor.

Measurements (see Table 1) were carried out on a Stoe four-circle diﬀractome-
ter 5C2 at the Orph´ee reactor (Laboratoire L´eon-Brillouin) [27]. The incident
neutron wavelength was λ = 0.8305 ˚A. Absorption correction were ignored.
Data analysis was carried out with the computer package CRYSTALS [28]

Crystal structures at room temperature are similar to those previously de-
termined with X-ray diﬀraction [22]. The potassium and cesium salts belong
to the I2/a and A2/a monoclinic space groups, respectively, both with four
entities in the unit cells (see Figs. 1 and 2). The two acetate residues are
crystallographically equivalent for both salts. They are linked by short hydro-
gen bonds lying across a centre of inversion (see Figs. 3 and 4). Hydrogen
bond lengths are identical at low temperature: Ro···o = 2.436(3) and 2.436 (4)
˚A, for the K and Cs derivatives, respectively (see Tables 3 and 6). At room
temperature, they are slightly diﬀerent: 2.432(3) and 2.444(2) ˚A, respectively.
However, the diﬀerence is tiny compared to the thermal factors for O atoms
(

0.05 ˚A2, see Tables 4 and 7).

≈

≈

At any temperature there is no evidence for splitting of the proton proba-
bility density that could be attributed to disorder over diﬀerent sites or to a
double well potential. At low temperature, the temperature factors for oxygen
atoms are much smaller than those for protons. As the latter compare to the
mean square amplitudes of displacements for proton oscillators with averaged
1000 cm−1 (see Tables 4 and 7), they are primarily due to
frequencies of
proton dynamics in a single well. At room temperature, the temperature fac-
tors increase substantially (see Figs. 3 and 4). For protons these factors can
be regarded as combinations of the proton contribution, virtually unchanged
compared to that at low temperature, with those of the oxygen atoms (those
labelled O(2) in Tables 4 and 7), which increase dramatically. Therefore, even
at room temperature, the temperature factors are not compatible with any
realistic double well potential, with minima separated by more than 0.5 ˚A
[23].

Finally, triﬂuoroacetate entities have diﬀerent conformations for the two salts
(see Figs. 3 and 4). A C—F bond is trans with respect to the CO(H) bond for
the K salt. One of the C—F bonds is virtually perpendicular to the carboxylic
plane for the Cs derivative.

2 INS band proﬁles and proton dynamics

The INS spectra in the OH stretching region, from Ref. [23], are presented in
Fig. 5. The raw data have been reanalyzed with a better background treat-

5

ment. The spectra, renormalized with respect to the amount of sample in the
beam, show very similar intensities, as anticipated for these closely related
salts. The OH stretching proﬁles were decomposed into gaussian components
(see Tables 8 and 9) and a linear baseline was subtracted. The grey compo-
nents correspond to Raman bands previously attributed to δ CF3 modes [23].
The remaining bands, for example at
601 (596), 703 (704), 798 (797), 870
≈
(878) and 956 (949) cm−1 for the K (Cs) derivative, are attributed to the OH
stretching modes.

As anticipated for hydrogen bonds with equal lengths, the ν OH proﬁles are
virtually identical. Only in the 820-920 cm−1 range, two components at 850
and 870 cm−1 are clearly visible for the Cs derivative, while there is only one
component for the K analogue. As rather strong Raman bands were observed
at 850 and 854 cm−1 for the potassium salt [23], we conclude that the INS
component at 870 cm−1 for the K derivative is an unresolved comprise of δ
CF3 and ν OH modes (see Table 8 and 9). It sounds logical that diﬀerent
frequencies for the δ CF3 modes arise from diﬀerent conformations of the CF3
groups (compare Figs. 3 and 4).

≈

· · ·

As the proﬁles are almost identical for the two systems, though they have dif-
ferent crystal structures, we assume that interdimer coupling within unit cells
are negligible. The rather complex ν OH proﬁles are thus supposed to arise
primarily from the internal dynamics of the hydrogen bond. At ﬁrst sight,
the slowly varying spacing of the components, namely
102 (108), 95 (93),
72 (81), 86 (70) cm−1 in Tables 8 and 9, is suggests a Franck-Condon-like
progression due to strong coupling with O
O modes [29–31]. However, the
dynamical separation, analogous to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for
electrons and nuclei, is irrelevant for strong hydrogen bonds with OH stretch-
ing at low frequency. Therefore, by analogy with the seminal case of potassium
hydrogen maleate [19], we assume that the eﬀective potential function for the
proton can be decomposed into a deep and narrow well containing the “bond-
ing” ground state and a shallow quasi harmonic potential for “non-bonding”
excited states. Then, the relative intensities of the components can be ascribed
to a substantial shift of the minimum of the upper shallow curve with respect
to the centre of the hydrogen bond. With this model, the best ﬁtting poten-
tial function to the observed spectral proﬁles of the K derivative is presented
in Fig. 6 and Table 10. The ﬁtting potential for the Cs derivative should be
virtually the same. The details of the numerical calculations are given in the
Appendix (see below).

We have limited the number of adjustable parameters in the potential func-
tion to the number of observed transitions. Since relative intensities were also
included in the model, the number of experimental values exceeds the number
of parameters. The potential function was decomposed into a narrow gaus-
1000 cm−1 and a rather ﬂat harmonic potential
sian well with a depth of

≈

6

whose fundamental frequency corresponds to the mean level-spacing. The lin-
ear term displacing the upper wave functions with respect to the ground state
allows for adjustment of relative intensities. The small cubic term accounts
for deviations from harmonicity of the upper potential.

≈

≈

The maximum diﬀerence between observed and calculated frequencies in Table
10 is ∆ν/ν
2%. The agreement between observed and calculated intensi-
30%. These diﬀerences
ties is less satisfactory, with deviations as large as
emphasize the limits of the model that ignores the complex interactions be-
tween ν OH and δ CF3 modes. Let us recall that the incoherent scattering
cross section of ﬂuorine atoms is negligible and the coherent cross section is
rather modest (
4 barns), compared to the incoherent cross section for H
atoms (
80 barns) [32]. Therefore, INS intensities for the CF3 modes are
almost totally borrowed from the OH mode, thanks to vibrational coupling
[23]. Consequently, the estimated frequencies and intensities obtained by sim-
ple decomposition into gaussian components presented in Tables 8 and 9 are
diﬀerent from what they should be in the absence of such interactions. We
did not try to model this complex interaction. Nevertheless, we consider that
coupling with CF3 modes should not alter the main features of the potential
function.

≈

≈

The potential function represented in Fig. 6 is totally unconventional and
we are not aware of any other reported example with similar shape. In the
ground state, the proton is well localized at the centre of the hydrogen bond.

The estimated vibrational mean square amplitude of
quite favorably to the temperature factors given in Tables 4 and 7. In the
excited states, proton transfer to one of the oxygen atom breaks down the

is clearly incompatible with the hydrogen bond length RO···O
the proton is in the ground state. Such a large displacement of the hydrogen
atom is possible if the hydrogen bond is disrupted in the excited states and
the spatial extension of the wave functions over several ˚A, greater than the
O distance at equilibrium, is representative of the dissociation of the salt.

The hydrogen bistriﬂuoroacetate complex in the OH excited state is tenta-
tively represented in Fig. 7. The proton is transferred to one of the two en-
tities. The extension of the wave functions suggests that there is a complex
combination of translation along the hydrogen bond and rotation around the
C—OH bond. At the same time, there may be some twisting around the C—C
O direction. These complex dynam-

timescale and can interact strongly.

The asymmetry of the potential in Fig. 6 contrasts to the symmetric potential
for potassium hydrogen maleate [19]. Presumably, the electronic structure of
the hydrogen maleate ring preserves the symmetry in the excited states. In
contrast to the naive representation of the dissociated excited state proposed
in Fig 10 of Ref. [19], the excited state should be regarded as a quantum
superposition of the two conﬁgurations corresponding to proton transferred
to one oxygen atom or the other.

The eﬀective potential functions discussed above were determined under the
assumption of a bare proton, m = 1 amu, while coupling with heavy atoms
were ignored. This approximation is reasonable only for the ground state. For
upper states, we should include dynamical coupling with internal degrees of
freedom of the triﬂuoroacetate entities, according to the scheme in Fig. 7.
Then, the eﬀective oscillator mass should be signiﬁcantly greater than 1 amu,
the eﬀective upper potential should be steeper than shown in Fig. 6 and the
spatial extension of the wave functions should be diminished. The modelling
of the eﬀective mass requires more information than available at the present
stage of investigation. However, we suspect the overall shape should remains
qualitatively the same.

Conclusion

The crystal structures of K and Cs hydrogen bistriﬂuoroacetates determined
with the single crystal neutron diﬀraction technique conﬁrm that the very
short hydrogen bonds linking triﬂuoroacetate entities are symmetrical at room
temperature and at 20 K or 14 K. There is no evidence for proton disorder
or phase transition. Any double minimum potential for the proton can be
rejected [23].

The complex INS spectral proﬁles for the OH stretching modes are tenta-
tively decomposed into gaussian components. Comparison with Raman spec-
tra allows us to distinguish bands arising from the δ CF3 modes in the same
frequency range. We can thus assign several OH stretching transitions and
propose a best ﬁtting potential largely inspired by that previously determined
for potassium hydrogen maleate [19]. This potential is composed of a narrow
well at the hydrogen bond centre containing the bonding ground state and
a rather ﬂat quasiharmonic upper part corresponding to non bonding states.
The rather low energy dissociation of this strong hydrogen bond is similar to
that observed previously for potassium hydrogen maleate. Apparently, it is a
property of this type of hydrogen bonding, rather than a consequence of the
particular structure of the maleate ring.

In contrast to potassium hydrogen maleate, symmetry breakdown occurs for

8

hydrogen bistriﬂuoroacetates upon excitation of the ν OH modes. We conclude
that the proton is transferred to one oxygen atom or the other. Presumably, the
preserved potential symmetry of the hydrogen maleate in the excited states
is a consequence of the particular structure of the ring. The excited states
should be regarded as quantum superposition of proton transferred to the two
oxygen atoms of the hydrogen bond.

We conclude that the concept of hydrogen bonding for the ground state and
hydrogen nonbonding for excited states could be of general relevance for strong
symmetric hydrogen bonds.

where Vp is the polynomial potential and VG the sum of three Gaussians, to
allow for a rich variety of potential forms.

The matrix elements used to calculate the eigenstates for a given oscillator
mass and a sixth order polynomial potential or a Gaussian potential can be
found in Refs. [33] and [34], respectively. As these papers may be nowadays
diﬃcult to obtain, we present the algorithms in condensed form, with an al-
ternative deﬁnition of the scaling factors for the polynomial form. We also
propose a straightforward method to test the accuracy of the eigenfunctions.

In order to construct a basis set, let ω0/(2π) be a frequency and consider
m ω0/~, ˜V = V /(~ ω0) and
the dimensionless variables ξ = α x, with α =
˜E = E/(~ ω0). Then

Here, the scaled energies are such that the diﬀerence between energy levels
of the harmonic oscillator is 1 instead of 4 in Ref. [33]. Our constants vl,
divided by a factor of 2 compared to [33] are such that the potential energy
of the harmonic oscillator ˜V = ξ2/2 corresponds to ˜vl = 1/2 δl,2 (where δl,2 is
the Kronecker symbol). This choice of scaling sounds more natural and clear.
Then, α = α0 √˜ν0 m∗ can be expressed in ˚A−1 units with α0 = 0.17273 and
˜ν0 = ω0/(2 π c) in cm−1 units.

the 10 lower eigenvalues is far beyond experimental errors and the accuracy
of the eigenvectors is better than 1%. Further increment of N is unnecessary
as numerical errors become larger the higher powers of x.

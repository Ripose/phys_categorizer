A method is proposed to pin down an unambiguous proof for single molecule surface enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The simultaneous use of two analyte molecules enables a clear con-
ﬁrmation of the single (or few) molecule nature of the signals. This method eliminates most of the
uncertainties associated with low dye concentrations in previous experiments. It further shows that
single-molecule signals are very common in SERS, both in liquids and on dry substrates.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) was dis-
covered in the 1970’s and was immediately the subject of
intense research up to the 1980’s. The possibility of ob-
serving Raman signals, which are normally very weak,
with enhancements of the order of 106 − 108 had in-
teresting applications, in particular in analytical chem-
istry. However, the lack of reproducibility, of adequate
SERS substrates, and of understanding of the SERS en-
hancement mechanisms hampered progress. An in-depth
review of these early studies can be found in Ref. [1].
Two independent reports [2, 3] in 1997 of the observa-
tion of single molecule emission under SERS conditions
triggered a renewed interest in this technique. It meant
that enhancement factors might be as large as 1015 to
compensate for the intrinsically small Raman cross sec-
tion, and that SERS probes could potentially replace ﬂu-
orescent ones in several applications; for example in bi-
ology. Some advantages of SERS over ﬂuorescence are
its higher spectral speciﬁcity and the possibility of using
infrared excitation (important in living tissues for exam-
ple). Studies of single-molecule SERS (SM-SERS) could
also lead to a better understanding of the SERS eﬀect
itself. However, SM-SERS has encountered many of the
same problems: ﬂuctuations, non-reproducibility, and a
lack of understanding of the origin of the sites suitable for
SM-SERS. Another major problem is the fact that single-
molecule emission has so far been inferred from indirect
evidence, casting doubts over the reality of SM-SERS
in the ﬁrst place and giving rise to alternative explana-
tions. This is perfectly summarized in the title of a dis-
cussion [4] by several of the authors of the ﬁrst reports of
SM-SERS [2, 3]: ”Single Molecule Raman Spectroscopy:
Fact or Fiction?”. They stress that the inference of SM-

SERS from their results is not straightforward, and that
although many evidence support it, it does not consti-
tute a proof in the absolute sense.
In this report, we
propose and apply a technique, Bi-Analyte SERS (Bi-
ASERS) which provides a much more direct evidence
for SM-SERS. The principle is to carry out SERS mea-
surements on a mixture of two diﬀerent analytes (dyes).
This alternative presents several advantages over previ-
ous techniques: ﬁrstly, it does not rely on ultra-low con-
centrations of analytes and on the observation of rare
events (such as that of a ‘hot’ particle [2]). Secondly, the
simplicity of the experiment and its interpretation makes
it a more direct and convincing evidence of SM-SERS.
Finally, it can be applied to most SERS substrates (dry
or colloidal) to test for the presence of SM-SERS. Using
BiASERS, we show that SM-SERS is, in fact, quite com-
mon and gives information on the nature of the active
sites, the so-called ‘hot spots’.

II. PREVIOUS WORK

In order to put this work in context, we ﬁrst review
the various evidence for SM-SERS. By far, the largest
group of evidence comes from studies of SERS on dry
silver colloidal particles [2, 5, 6, 7]. Silver colloids mixed
with dyes are immobilized after drying or spin-coated on
a suitable substrate. The dye concentration is chosen
so that there are a small number of dyes per colloids.
SERS signals from individual colloids or clusters are then
collected and analyzed. The single molecule nature of
these signals is inferred mainly from two characteristics:

• Firstly, the low dye concentration suggests that,
statistically speaking, there cannot be much more
than one dye per colloid [2, 5, 6]. However, it
was acknowledged early that these concentration
estimates do not necessarily provide a satisfac-
tory proof [2, 4]. They are indeed prone to large
errors: colloid concentration is usually estimated

from a knowledge of Ag mass used during prepa-
ration [8] and an estimate of their average size (or
volume). Any non-reacted Ag, or the presence of
a small number of much-larger-than-average par-
ticles could lead to an overestimation of colloid
concentration and therefore an underestimate of
dye:colloid ratio. Moreover, dye concentrations be-
low 1 nM require particular care to avoid contami-
nation, wall adsorption, and dilution errors [9]. A
further source of uncertainty is the fact that only
a small proportion of colloid aggregates (so-called
‘hot’ particles) seem to give rise to SERS signals.
This means that there is a possibility that those
active aggregates are the ones who have adsorbed
a larger than average number of dyes because, for
example, they present a larger surface area, or are
composed of many individual colloids.

• Secondly, these SERS signals exhibit strong ﬂuc-
tuations, both in intensity and spectral shape,
along with blinking (alternating on/oﬀ periods).
These are usually considered a characteristic of SM-
emission [5, 7, 10]. However, such ﬂuctuations are
often observed in SERS, even in conditions of high
dye concentration, where the signal is not believed
to originate from single molecules. They were also
observed in the SERS spectra of residual amor-
phous carbon on the colloids, and attributed to
ongoing photo-induced chemical reactions on the
surface, such as photo-oxidation [11, 12]. Blink-
ing can be observed in SM ﬂuorescence as a result
of photo-bleaching. However, ﬂuorescence-induced
photo-bleaching requires exciting the molecule to
its ﬁrst excited state.
It is believed that photo-
bleaching is minimized under SERS conditions be-
cause of very fast energy transfer to the metal.
Other photo-induced eﬀects in SERS can be desorp-
tion, molecule dissociation, or modiﬁcation of the
silver conﬁguration itself (through photo-oxidation
for example). These can be induced directly by
light or indirectly by photo-induced thermal heat-
ing of the metal substrate [13]. The diﬀerence with
photo-bleaching is that these eﬀects are coopera-
tive, i.e. they are likely to aﬀect all molecules at the
same time (for example when the metal reaches a
critical temperature). Therefore, blinking in SERS
cannot be invoked as an unambiguous proof of sin-
gle molecule emission.

Other indirect evidence were put forward, for example
by studying the polarization property of the SERS signal
[2], but they rely on a theoretical understanding of the
details of the SERS mechanism, which is still open to
debate. In particular, the polarization selection rules of
a molecule in close proximity to surface plasmons can be
severely modiﬁed with respect to the bare Raman tensor
polarization selection rules; an eﬀect which has a long-
standing history in SERS and related techniques [14].

2

Another type of SM-SERS study was carried out in
liquid colloidal solution [3]. The evidence for SM detec-
tion was based mainly on the ultra-low dye concentration
(33 fM). It was further supported by the observation of
a Poissonian distribution of the SERS intensities. How-
ever, the main problem with this type of experiments is
that the small number of events (100) is not signiﬁcant
enough to rule out other distributions. For example, a
sample of 100 intensities following a log-normal distribu-
tion often exhibits oscillations similar to that shown in
Ref.
[3], such a
Poissonian distribution would require a very large uni-
formity in the SERS signals (or enhancements), which
is not common in SERS experiments, and that nearly
every single molecule in the scattering volume would be
detected. As pointed out recently [15], this is in contra-
diction with the ﬁndings of the other original report of
SM-SERS where only a small number of ‘hot’ particles
gave rise to SM-SERS [2]. The convolution problem of
the enhancement factor and the dye concentration is very
diﬃcult to break in these approaches.

[3]. Moreover, as pointed out in Ref.

Despite the uncertainties, this body of evidence has led
to the general acceptance that SM-SERS is a real phe-
nomenon, in particular on dry substrates, even if no abso-
lute proof was available. The consensus is that there are
very few active particles (≈ 0.1%) [2] capable of produc-
ing SM signals. In addition, there are on these particles
only a few site capable of providing suﬃciently large en-
hancement for SM-SERS. These sites are typically at the
junction between two closely spaced colloids [6, 16], and
corresponds to only 0.01 – 0.1% of the surface area of a
dimer. Such an interpretation is supported by theoretical
studies [17, 18]. One therefore easily sees the conundrum
of SM-SERS: how can we place a molecule at these rare
active sites and be sure that the signal comes from this
molecule only? All approaches so far have relied on low
dye concentrations, which more or less ensures that only
a few dyes are observed at a time. However, the probabil-
ity of having a molecule at an active site then becomes
very small, leading to unreliable statistics, and making
the SM interpretation of the signals very diﬃcult.

Our approach is exactly the opposite. We use a rel-
atively high concentration of dyes to ensure that there
is indeed at least one molecule at most active sites. In
order to conﬁrm the SM nature of the signal, we simply
use a mixture of two dye molecules (BiASERS). Because
of the large number of molecules, the SERS signal should
in principle always be a mixture of these two dyes. The
observation of a SERS signal of purely one type of dye
(say Dye 1) is a clear evidence that it comes from a very
small number of molecules. For example, if the signal
originates from exactly 5 molecules, the probability of it
being purely Dye 1 is only 1/32, going down to 1/1024
for 10 molecules. The main advantage of this method, in
addition to its simplicity, is that it enables to probe every
active sites and it does not rely on an accurate estimate
of the dye:colloid ratio.

III. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Our citrate-reduced silver colloid solutions were pre-
pared using standard procedures [8]. Rhodamine 6G
(RH6G) was used as purchased, while the benzotriazole
dye (BTZ) was synthesized following the procedure de-
scribed in Ref.
[19] (dye # 2 of this reference). RH6G
has been widely used in the past for SERS and SM-SERS.

believed to adsorb strongly (through covalent bonding)
to silver [19]. Under standard conditions, the two dyes
show strong SERS spectra, which are easily distinguish-
able, as shown in Fig. 1. Of particular interest are non-
overlapping peaks that allow unequivocal identiﬁcation of
the diﬀerent dye species. Raman spectra were acquired
using a Jobin Yvon Labram confocal Raman spectrome-
ter, with a ×100 immersion objective index-matched to
water or a ×100 objective matched to air for dry sub-
strates. Excitation was carried out with a 633 nm HeNe
laser (2 mW at the sample for liquids, 0.2 mW for the Ra-
man map on dry substrates). Solution K was prepared
by mixing 0.5 mL of colloidal solution with 0.5 mL of a
20 mM KCl solution. The main eﬀect of KCl is to reduce
the Coulombic repulsion between the colloidal particles.
Using a 35 mM KCl solution triggers aggregation and col-

lapse of the colloids. SERS signals are usually very small
at low KCl concentrations (< 5 mM), because they orig-
inate from single, non-interacting colloids. Using 20 mM
KCl (10 mM ﬁnal concentration in solution), the colloidal
solution remains stable for several weeks. However, the
Coulombic repulsion is suﬃciently reduced to allow col-
loids to form aggregates. The stability of these samples
indicate that these aggregates must be small, most likely
pairs of colloids. Such interactions are necessary to ob-
serve large SERS signals. All colloidal solutions were
then prepared by adding a small volume of a dye solution
(BTZ, RH6G, or a mixture of both) to solution K. We
used ﬁnal dye concentration in the range 20 to 100 nM.
All colloid solutions were left to rest for several hours or
more before measurements.

For experiments on dry colloids, a 40 µL drop of such
a colloid+dye solution was deposited and left for one
minute on a positively-charged Polylysine-coated glass
slide. Because of the negative charge on the colloids,
clusters close to the Polylysine surface are immobilized
through electrostatic interactions [2]. The slide was then
rinsed with distilled water, leaving a small density of im-
mobilized clusters for SERS measurements.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We ﬁrst focus on a colloidal solution prepared with
a mixture of equal concentration (100 nM for each dye)
of RH6G and BTZ (solution C). Control samples with
100 nM of BTZ only (solution A) or RH6G only (solu-
tion B) were also measured for comparison. We estimate
that this corresponds to at least 1200 dyes of each type
per colloids, much more than in any previous SM-SERS
studies. We also estimate a surface density of around
0.1 dye of each type per nm2, which indicates that there
should not be any steric hinderance for adsorption (typ-
ical surface area of an adsorbed dye is 1 nm2). There is
also on average between 1 and 4 colloids (or between 0.5
and 2 pairs) at any given time in the scattering volume.
A series of 1000 SERS spectra with 0.2 s integration time
were collected from each solution and analyzed. The re-
sults are summarized in Fig. 1. The average spectra
of solution A and B show that RH6G and BTZ have
clearly distinguishable SERS spectra. The RH6G spec-
trum is stronger due to its higher SERS cross-section
under these conditions. Solution C shows a superposi-
tion of these two spectra, which is identical to the sum
of the spectra from sol A and B, within the experimen-
tal errors. This strongly indicates that the two dyes do
not interact with each other and adsorb on the colloids
independently of each other, as expected from the low
surface densities. We now focus on the analysis of the
1000 individual spectra obtained from solution C. Most
spectra exhibit a good signal, indicating that interacting
colloids are on average always present in the scattering
volume. We observe ﬂuctuations in intensity and spec-
tral shape. These are attributed to constantly changing

colloid conﬁgurations in the scattering volume because
of the unavoidable Brownian motion, and are not neces-
sarily a sign of SM-SERS. More interesting are the large
ﬂuctuations observed in the relative proportion of sig-
nal from each of the dyes. For example, in Fig. 1 (B)
are shown two representative scans where the signals is
composed of purely one or the other type of dye. This,
we believe, shows unambiguously that the SERS signal
is dominated by a very small number of molecules, and
represents the simplest and most direct evidence for SM-
SERS. We believe that this is a reliable experimental
proof of an assumption which, although widely accepted
in the literature as possible, is very diﬃcult to demon-
strate experimentally.

In addition, the average BiASERS spectrum and the
1000 spectra of solution C were ﬁtted as a weighted su-
perposition of the average spectra of BTZ and RH6G
(obtained from solution A and B). The ﬁt for the aver-
age spectrum leads to a 1:1 superposition of the aver-

4

age RH6G-only and BTZ-only spectra, and we assume
this corresponds to a 1:1 dye ratio. The weighted ﬁts
therefore enable to extract a single percentage pB char-
acterizing the proportion of the total signal in each spec-
trum originating from BTZ. If the enhancement mecha-
nism was uniform, this percentage would correspond to
the proportion of molecules producing the observed BTZ
signal. For example, a ﬁt of the average spectrum gives
pB = 0.5 (1:1 dye ratio) even if the integrated inten-
sity is dominated by RH6G peaks because of its higher
cross section. This procedure, accordingly, acts as a nor-
malization condition for the diﬀerent cross sections of
the dyes. The statistics of pB is illustrated in Fig. 2
in two forms: (A) Histograms of the probability distri-
bution of pB, and (B) correlation plot of pB with SERS
intensity. pB represents the proportion of BTZ molecules
if the signals from each molecule was perfectly uniform
and equal to the average signal. Because there are in ex-
cess of 1000 molecules of each type on each colloid, one
always expects that pB ≈ 0.5, with negligible ﬂuctua-
tions around this value. Fig. 1 (B) and Fig. 2 (A) show
that this is clearly not the case, with several events where
pB ≈ 0 or pB ≈ 1. The most likely explanation is that,
at least for these events, the signal is dominated by a few
molecules, those situated at the position of highest en-
hancements. A simple description is to assume that the
observed signals originate only from a given ﬁxed (small)
area of large enhancements , a ‘hot-spot’. The number of
molecules of each type in this area then follows a Poisso-
nian distribution with the same average µ (because dyes
are in 1:1 ratio). One can then easily derive the proba-
bility distribution of pB for a given µ. As shown in Fig.
2 (A), a value of µ ≈ 4 ﬁts well to our experimental re-
sults. The statistics of pB therefore suggests that most
clusters exhibit a SERS enhancement that is suﬃcient
for single molecule detection within our integration time
of 0.2 s. Note that we are not strictly speaking observ-
ing SM-SERS here since the signal originates on aver-
age from around 4 molecules, but a signal only 4 times
smaller is still well within the detection limit. Reducing
the dye concentration would only result in many events
where no dye are present in the hot-spot, making the
statistical analysis more diﬃcult, like in previous stud-
ies. Finally, for larger values of µ, the distribution of pB
should be increasingly peaked around 0.5, and the prob-
ability of extreme events (pB < 0.2 or pB > 0.8) should
decrease drastically. We clearly observe this eﬀect exper-
imentally as shown in Fig. 2 (A) in the histogram for a
solution identical to C, but with doubled concentration
for each dye (200 nM). It is clear that the occurrence
of extreme events has virtually disappeared. This simple
model clearly accounts for the few-molecule nature of the
signals. Moreover, assuming that the signals originate
from a pair of colloids and comparing the value of µ to the
average number of molecules on this pair, we can estimate
the hot-spot area to be only ≈ 4/2400 ≈ 0.17% of the to-
tal surface area. Such an estimate is much easier with
BiASERS than with conventional low dye concentration

methods. However, this model assumes that the charac-
teristics of the hot-spots are the same for each event, and
that every molecule in the hot-spot contributes equally
to the signal, which are clearly rough approximations.
For example, Fig. 2 (B) presents a clear indication that
the nature of the hot-spots changes from one event to
the other. If large SERS events corresponded simply to
instances where more molecules are present in the hot-
spot area, then these events should be more likely to be
of a ‘mixed’ type, while low intensity events should ex-
hibit more of the extreme ‘pure dye’ type. Our results
suggest the opposite:
‘pure’ events only occur for high
intensity events. This suggests a strong correlation be-
tween the size of a hot-spot and its enhancement. Such a
correlation is actually predicted by theoretical studies of
the SERS electromagnetic enhancement, where high en-
hancement are correlated with strong localization. This
is another characteristic of the eﬀect that is very diﬃcult
to prove experimentally under normal situations.

It is interesting to relate these results to the standard
example of a hot-spot formed by a pair of closely-spaced

ration d between the colloids. As d decreases, the SERS
enhancement increases and becomes more localized in be-
tween the two colloids. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 us-
ing a simple electromagnetic model of colloid interaction.
The plots were obtained using a 2D electrostatics approx-
imation and represent the SERS enhancement factors,
approximated by the fourth power of the ﬁeld amplitude
enhancement, |E|4. The two cylinders have a diameter of
50 nm and are separated by d = 6 or d = 3 nm. The op-
tical properties of Ag were used for the colloids, and the
environment is water (ǫr = 1.77). Excitation is polarized
along the dimer axis at a wavelength λ = 500 nm, i.e.
red-shifted compared to the single and coupled plasmon
resonances of the system. This simple model is obvi-
ously over-simpliﬁed, but it clearly illustrates the point
we want to make: the region of highest enhancement
(hot-spot) is increasingly localized for the smallest sepa-
rations. In Figs. 3 (b) and (c) we show the normalized
SERS enhancements on the surface of one colloid as a
function of angular position, θ (θ = π/2 corresponds to
the dimer axis). For each plot, the colored area corre-
sponds to 80% of the total area and is a good represen-
tation of the hot-spot (deﬁned here as the region from
which 80% of the total SERS intensity originates). This
corresponds to an angle interval [π/2 − α; π/2 + α] from
which we derive a percentage q2D = α/π. q2D is the
proportion of the cylinder circumference covered by the
hot-spot. To extend this result to 3D, we assume that
the hot-spot corresponds to a solid angle Ω deﬁned by a
semi-angle α: Ω = 2π(1 − cos(α)). The hot-spot there-
fore covers a proportion q3D = Ω/(4π) ≈ α2/4 of the
total surface area. Despite the simplicity of this model,
the value of q3D ≈ 0.29% obtained for d = 3 nm is of the
same order as that inferred from the histogram of Fig.
2 (B). It is also apparent that the hot-spot area is cor-
related with the colloid separation d and therefore with
the total SERS enhancements. This is in agreement with
the correlation observed in the scatter plot of Fig. 2 (B).

Finally, in order to link this study to previous works,
mostly carried out on dry colloidal particles, we show
in Fig. 4 the results of such an experiment using Bi-
ASERS. There are on average 240 dyes of each type per
colloid (dye concentration is 20 nM before drying), and
therefore more than 500 molecules of each type per clus-
ter, depending on their size. The Raman map in Fig.
4 (D) suggests that all clusters are active at these con-
centrations. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (A-C), we
can again observe signals composed purely of the SERS
spectrum of one type of dye, despite the large number of
molecules of both types. This is again a clear indication
that SM emission is the norm, rather than the exception.
Such a conclusion could only be inferred statistically in
previous low-concentration studies because of the small
probability of ﬁnding a molecule at a hot-spot. How-
ever, we insist that the rarity of these events was not

FIG. 4: BiASERS for dry colloids. Top: Individual spectra
composed of purely RH6G (A), both RH6G and BTZ (B), and
purely BTZ (C). Note that there is on average in excess of 500
molecules of each type per clusters. Bottom: 200 × 100 µm2

due to the small number of hot-spots or ‘hot-particles’,
but to the small probability of having a molecule there.
In other words, most particles are ‘hot’ provided that a
probe molecule is present at the right position. This is
easily achievable in BiASERS (due to the large concen-
tration of dyes) whilst keeping the ability to distinguish

V. CONCLUSION

In closing, we have proposed and applied a new method
to evidence SM-SERS, using a combination of two SERS
probes. Using such a mixture of two distinguishable
probes circumvents many problems associated with low-
concentration studies.
It enables to study most SM-
SERS events, instead of a very small number with un-
reliable statistics. This technique is simple, unambigu-
ous, and of wide applicability to various SERS sub-
strates. Our results readily demonstrate that single-
molecule SERS is common, even in stable colloidal so-
lutions. It could further be used to study a number of
outstanding issues in SERS, which we have only brieﬂy
outlined here. For example, it could shed new light into
the nature of SERS hot-spots themselves, and can also
be applied to determine the SERS cross-sections and en-
hancements with more accuracy . All this is necessary
for a better understanding of SM-SERS. This will not,
however, solve another major challenge of SM-SERS in
the reverse problem, namely : how we can force a single
available molecule to go to the right position in order to
observe its SERS signal? This will be necessary for some
of the most exciting proposed applications of SM-SERS,
such as single-DNA-molecule sequencing.

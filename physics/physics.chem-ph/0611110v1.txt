Abstract

We have developed a general approach for the calculation of the single molecule polarization

correlation function C(t), which delivers a correlation of the emission dichroisms at time 0 and

t. The approach is model independent and valid for general asymmetric top molecules. The

key dynamic quantities of our analysis are the even-rank orientational correlation functions, the

weighted sum of which yields C(t). We have demonstrated that the use of non-orthogonal schemes

for the detection of the single molecule polarization responses makes it possible to manipulate the

weighting coeﬃcients in the expansion of C(t). Thus valuable information about the orientational

correlation functions of the rank higher than second can be extracted from C(t).

INTRODUCTION

The formulation of the polarization-sensitive spectroscopy in terms of the orientational

correlation functions (OCFs) has opened up a possibility of the uniﬁed description of various

signals and clariﬁed information content of diﬀerent spectroscopic techniques.1 As has been

demonstrated, all large variety of diﬀerent polarization signals can be described by the OCFs

of the ﬁrst and second rank.1,2,3,4 More speciﬁcally, one can ”measure” either OCFs in the

time domain, or their time derivatives, or their Fourier spectra, or their integral relaxation

times. It is this uniﬁcation which has made it possible to compare the results of diﬀerent

measurements and to learn about the mechanisms of molecular reorientation, both in the

gas phase and in the condensed phase. The contemporary nonlinear (third order) ultrafast

polarization spectroscopy is interpreted in terms of the three-time correlation functions

(CFs) of the dipole moments or polarizability tensors involved.5 However, in practices, their

inﬂuence on a signal is normally accounted for by a static averaging, or the three-time

polarization CFs reduce to the standard OCFs of the second rank, due to either the strong

optical dephasing or the shortness of the laser pulse on the rotational dynamic timescale.

All the written above pertains to spectroscopy of ensembles,

in which the measured

response is averaged over many single-particle contributions. The situation with the single

molecule (SM) spectroscopy in general,6,7,8,9,10 and the SM polarization spectroscopy in

particular,7,11 is very diﬀerent. The SM signal delivers a response of an individual system,

whose time dependence reports about ﬂuctuations caused by the system ”nanoenvironment”.

Ideally, one would prefer to measure the three-dimensional orientation of the emission

dipole moment(s) in real time.

Indeed, there exist several schemes which allow us to do

that7,12,13,14,15,16,17. These techniques require, typically, many photons to get a good signal-

to-noise ratio. This obstacle restricts the length and the time resolution of the recorded

signal. Fourkas has suggested that the time evolution of the emission dipole can be deter-

mined ”on the ﬂy”, by detecting SM emission along three diﬀerent polarization directions.18

Hohlbein and H¨ubner have recently implemented this method.19

So far, many SM experiments have been designed to detect the in-plane projection of the

SM emission along two diﬀerent (mutually perpendicular) polarization directions. Thereby

long enough transients can be measured, which permit of the reliable calculation of SM

CFs. The SM dichroism CF is the key dynamic quantity which is delivered by the polariza-

2

tion SM ﬂuorescence microscopy.17,20,21,22,23,24 This CF is much more complicated than its

counterparts which describe polarization responses in ensemble measurements.

The SM dichroism CF is the core object of the present study, which has been inspired

by the recent papers.23,24 Our aim is threefold. First, we generalize the approach, which has

been developed in23,24 for spherical top molecules within the small-angle rotational diﬀusion

model, to asymmetric top molecules and beyond any particular model of molecular reori-

entation. The key dynamic quantities here are the even-rank OCFs, which can either be

evaluated within any model of the molecular reorientation available in the literature,2,3,25 or

simulated on a computer.26 Second, we discuss a possibility of gaining additional knowledge

about molecular reorientation by utilizing non-orthogonal schemes for the detection of SM

polarization responses. Third, we demonstrate that a valuable information about the OCFs

of the rank higher than second can be extracted from the SM CFs. Until recently, such an

information was available only through the computer simulations and model calculations.

II. SINGLE MOLECULE DICHROISM

The key quantity in the SM polarization microscopy is the dichroism

Here Ii are the intensities of the light emission which are detected at two diﬀerent (usually,

mutually perpendicular) polarizations ei, i = 1, 2. Within the oscillator model, the excita-

tion and emission processes are independent, so that the emission intensity is proportional

to the product of two probabilities,1,27

and the SM dichroism (1) is independent of the absorption cross-section σa. The absorption

probability is given by the square of the scalar product of the polarization of the absorbed

light ea and the absorption dipole moment µa:28

The emission cross-section is given by a similar expression,30

When the ﬂuorescence is collected from an ensemble of molecules, molecular contributions

add up incoherently. Thus, in order to get the total emission intensity, one has to average

Eq.(5) over all possible orientations of the wave vector k. This yields

µ, so that the

If we collect emission from a single molecule, the above incoherent averaging procedure

is not legitimate any longer. Since the wave vector k is speciﬁc to a photon which has been

emitted by the molecule but the direction of k is unknown, we have to average the emission

probability (4) over all those k which can be collected by the objective. Let s be the unit

vector along the axis of the objective (s

vector k, so that ks = cos(ϑk). We also introduce the light-collection cone angle

medium in which the sample is embedded (Fig. 1 clariﬁes the meaning of the introduced

quantities). If we further assume that the emitting molecule is located at the focal point

of the ideal and polarization-preserving objective which collects the emission, then the k-

monotonically with χ: p(0)= q(0)= 0, while p(π/2) = 1/7 and q(π/2) = 1. For every χ,

q(χ) > p(χ). Eq.(8) reduces to Eq.(6) in the limit of small collection angle (χ

There exists an important particular case, in which CF (20) simpliﬁes greatly. Namely,

isotropic. Then one can show (see, e.g., Ref.33 for more details), that the fundamental OCF

They can either be simulated on a computer26 or evaluated within the models of molecular

reorientation available in the literature.2,3,25

Eq.(23) can further be simpliﬁed in the following important particular case. Let us

assume that the quantity of interest, B(Ω), is speciﬁed by the orientation of a unit vector

(for example, a dipole moment) d, which is ”rigidly attached” to the molecule, i.e., B(Ω)

→
B(d). The orientation of the unit vector d is uniquely determined by the the spherical
angles α, β and is speciﬁed, therefore, by the reduced D-function Dj
from the numerical factor, coincides with the corresponding spherical harmonics,36

l0(α, β, 0) which, apart

l0(α, β, 0)

On writing Eq.(26), we have tacitly assumed that the unit vector d is pointed along the

z-axis of the molecular reference frame. In this case, the terms with m = m′ = 0 survive

only in Eq.(23), so that

in which X(Ω) is the SM dichroism (12) and its time-dependence is induced by molecular

rotation.40 To apply a general formalism outlined in the previous section for the evaluation

D-functions. This is easily achieved by the formula

and similar expressions for the scalar products (eiµ)2. Emphasize that the spherical angles

αs, βs and αµ, βµ in Eq.(29) are time-independent and specify orientations of the vectors

s and µ, correspondingly, in the laboratory and molecular reference frames. The proper

description of molecular reorientation is accounted for by the (time-dependent) Euler angles

Ω.

To simplify the subsequent calculations, we can proceed as has been described in the

previous section and choose the molecular reference frame in such a way that the emission

dipole moment µ is directed along the z-axis of this frame. This is tantamount to putting
αµ = βµ = 0 in Eq.(29). Then Dj

m0(0, 0, 0) = δm0 (the latter being the Kronecker delta),

and Eq.(29) becomes independent of the angle γ of rotation about the molecular z-axis:

(30)

Upon the insertion of this formula (and similar expressions for (eiµ)2) into Eq. (21) one

realizes that dichroism X (Eq.(12)) becomes a function of two Euler angles α and β, X(α, β).

Thus, Eqs. (21)-(25) are applicable to this case. By using the interconnection (26) between

the spherical harmonics and D-functions, one ﬁnally gets

domain of validity of Eqs. (31), (32) is not conﬁned to linear rotors and spherical tops.

They are valid for a general asymmetric top molecule and will be employed in the remainder

of the present paper.

A word of caution is however in order. First, one should keep in mind that Eqs. (31),

(32) are applicable for molecular rotation in an isotropic space.

If there exist external

potentials, one should use a more general formula (20). Second, Eqs. (31), (32) are valid if

and only if the molecular z-axis coincides with the direction of the emission dipole moment

µ. This direction, however, may not coincide with the molecular symmetry axis. This means

that such a choice of the molecular frame may not accommodate the molecular symmetry

properly.

In order to do that and to evaluate Gj

00(t) eﬃciently, we can switch from the

initial frame to another ”convenient” molecular frame via the corresponding Wigner matrix

sections (3) and (6) into Eq.(2) and applying Eqs. (23)-(25), one obtains the standard result

V. RANK DEPENDENCE OF THE SINGLE MOLECULE SIGNAL

Once the emission dipole moment µ is pointed along the z-axis of the molecular reference

frame, then Eqs. (31) and (32) determine the SM CF. The coeﬃcients Aj

00 depend upon

the OCF rank j, the NA angle χ, and the relative orientation ϕ of the polarizers e1 and e2
arccos(e1e2)). Hereafter, we denote these coeﬃcients as Aj(χ, ϕ). The standard choice

(ϕ

of the orthogonal detection scheme corresponds to Aj(χ, π/2). The term A0(χ, ϕ)

0, since

≡

≡

the isotropic component does not contribute to dichroism (12). Furthermore, the symmetry

of the D-functions dictates that only the coeﬃcients with even j contribute into Eq.(31). It

can thus be recast into the form

C(t) =

A2σ(χ, ϕ)G2σ(t).

(38)

(we have dropped the 00-subscripts for the clarity of notation, and the CF is assumed to be

normalized to unity, that is C(0) = 1). Formally speaking, the SM CF is expressed by the

linear combination of all even-rank OCFs.43 Their relative contributions are determined by

the weighting coeﬃcients A2σ(χ, ϕ), which decrease rapidly with the OCF rank j, so that a

few of them contribute signiﬁcantly into Eq.(38).

Let us consider a special case of the orthogonal registration scheme (ϕ = π/2) ﬁrst. If the

NA is negligibly small (χ = 0), one gets the set of coeﬃcients A2σ(0, π/2), which have been

calculated and analysed in.23,24 In this case, A2(0, π/2) = 0.835, A4(0, π/2) = 0.100, etc., so

that the contribution due to the second-rank OCF yields more than 83%. In the opposite

∞

case of a high NA (χ = π/2), as is clear from Eq.(15), the second-rank OCF contributes

exclusively into CF (38), and C(t)

P2(µµ(t)

∼ h

. Thus, apart from the numerical factor,
i

the SM CF coincides with the ensemble averaged anisotropy. Since the parameters p and

q in Eq.(8) increase monotonously with χ (see Fig. 2), the signiﬁcance of all coeﬃcients

A2σ(χ, π/2) with σ > 1 decreases with χ. As has been shown in,24 for example, the CF C(t)

corresponding to NA = 0.6, n = 1.4 coincides, practically, with G2(t).

The analysis which has been carried out in Ref.24 and the above considerations mean that,

under some typical experimental conditions (ϕ = π/2 and χ being close to π/2), the SM CF

C(t) is indistinguishable from the second-rank OCF G2(t). If one considers a complicated

dependence of C(t) on OCFs of various ranks as a nuisance, which obscures interpretation

of the measured signal, then the use of the orthogonal detection scheme in conjunction with

high-NA optics allows one to “measure” the standard second-rank OCF. On the other hand,

Eq.(38) hints at a unique opportunity to learn about higher-rank OCFs experimentally, even

with the use of high-NA optics. We suggest that the non-orthogonal registration scheme,

when e1 and e2 are not perpendicular to each other, makes this possible.

To clarify the situation, let us consider the signal intensity (36) which is measured within

the ensemble-averaged spectroscopy. The intensity consists of the sum of the isotropic

component, which contains no information about molecular rotation, and the anisotropic

component,

P2(µaµ(t)
h

i

. The eﬀect of the detection scheme is exclusively deﬁned by the

numerical factor P2(eaei), which determines the relative weights of the two components.

Therefore, in order to extract OCF

out of the signal, it is suﬃcient to perform

P2(µaµ(t)
h

i

measurements of the emission intensities at any two diﬀerent polarizations e1 and e2. A

common practice is to use the magic angle conditions (P2(eaei) = 0, eaei = 1/√3), as well

as parallel (P2(eaei) = 1, eaei = 1) and perpendicular (P2(eaei) =

1/2, eaei = 0) detection

−

schemes.

The situation with the SM polarization spectroscopy is very diﬀerent. The SM CF (38)

has weighted contributions from virtually all even-ranked OCFs, and the weights themselves,

A2σ(χ, ϕ), are clearly detection scheme dependent. The coeﬃcients A2σ(χ, ϕ) for several few

ﬁrst σ are plotted in Fig. 3 for χ = 0 (small NA) and for χ = π/2 (high NA). The

parameters p and q in Eq.(12) increase monotonously with χ (see Fig. 2). One thus expects

that the coeﬃcients A2σ(χ, ϕ) transform gradually from those depicted in Fig. 3 in the

upper panel to those depicted in the lower panel, following the increase of χ.

11

Evidently, A2(χ, ϕ)-components dominate the signal for any polarization scheme, so that

the contribution due to the second rank OCFs is the most signiﬁcant. Both A2(0, ϕ) and

A2(π/2, ϕ) reach their maxima at ϕ = π/2: A2(0, ϕ = π/2) = 0.835 and A2(π/2, ϕ = π/2) =

1. This means that the standard orthogonal scheme reﬂects predominantly the decay of the

second rank OCF, since 84% of the low-NA signal and 100% of the high-NA signal is

determined by G2(t). If the angle ϕ between the polarizations e1 and e2 decreases, then the
contribution due to A2(0, ϕ) also dominates, but the higher rank OCFs start to contribute

more and more signiﬁcantly. For a low-NA signal, for example, the forth-rank contribution

achieves its maximum of 23% at ϕ = π/8 while the second order contribution remains as

high as 46%. The shapes of the curves A2σ(0, ϕ) and A2σ(π/2, ϕ) are evidently diﬀerent.

Every coeﬃcient A2σ(0, ϕ) with σ > 1, as a function of ϕ, exhibits an (asymmetric) bell-like

shape with a single maximum. A2(π/2, ϕ), as well as A2(0, ϕ), increase monotonously with

ϕ, while all A2σ(π/2, ϕ) with σ > 1 decrease rapidly. An overall tendency can be described

as follows: the closer are e1 and e2 to each other, the more A2σ(χ, ϕ) coeﬃcients contribute

to the signal. This is clariﬁed by Figs. 4, in which we present the completeness parameters

for few ﬁrst ξ. As to the low-NA detection, the ﬁrst few σ are necessary to faithfully

reproduce the signal for ϕ close to π/2, while much more terms are necessary for small ϕ.

The same is also true for the high-NA detection, but the convergence is much more rapid.

In general, the high-NA detection is more second-rank OCF dominated than the low-NA

one. We emphasize however that the high-NA CF C(t) coincides with G2(t) in the case of

the orthogonal detection scheme only (ϕ = π/2). Otherwise, it also depends on OCFs of

diﬀerent even ranks.

We conclude the present section with the following comment. On writing the starting

Eq.(1) for the SM dichroism, we have tacitly assumed that the emission intensities I1 and

I2 scale identically. To take into account a possible imbalance η of the channels, we can
ηI2)/(I1 + ηI2).44 We can then repeat the above analysis,
redeﬁne the SM dichroism as (I1
taking into account that the coeﬃcients A2σ(χ, ϕ) acquire an additional η-dependence. In

that case, for example, the isotropic contribution is nonzero, A0(χ, ϕ)

VI. EXTRACTION OF THE HIGH-RANK ORIENTATIONAL CORRELATION

FUNCTIONS FROM THE SINGLE MOLECULE SIGNAL

As has been demonstrated in Sec.5, the non-orthogonal detection schemes contain, po-

tentially, more information on the high-rank OCFs than the standard orthogonal schemes.

The question thus arises if it is possible to extract G2σ(t) with σ > 1 from the SM CF

C(t). To clarify the situation, we compute the signal within the simplest model of molecular

reorientation, the spherical top small angle diﬀusion. Within this model,42 the OCFs are

described by the exponential formula

Gj

00(t) =

Gj

00(t) = exp

j(j + 1)Dkt
}

.

(40)

We have chosen this model since it is most frequently applied for the interpretation of SM

e

CFs.

Let us consider the small-NA detection ﬁrst (Fig. 5). C(t) calculated within the orthog-

onal detection scheme (ϕ = π/2) and within the scheme with ϕ = π/8 (this angle provides

the maximum for the G4(t)-contribution, see Fig. 3, upper panel) are seen to be markedly

diﬀerent, both mutually and from G2(t). On the other hand, the SM CF with ϕ = π/2

is rather close to G2(t), and the slopes of both SM CFs, as well as the slope of G2(t), are

almost the same. This is totally understandable, since (i) 84% of the ϕ = π/2 CF and 46%

of its ϕ = π/8 counterpart are determined by G2(t) and (ii) the higher-rank OCFs decay

much more rapidly than those with j = 2.

Theoretically speaking, the procedure of the extraction of the high-rank OCFs from C(t)

is straightforward. One can perform several (say, N) measurements at N diﬀerent detection

angles ϕ, truncate the number of summations in Eq.(38) by N, and solve the corresponding

system of linear equations for G2σ(t), σ = 1

N. Such a procedure, however, can hardly

÷
be feasible in practice. There exists a cruder, but much more robust procedure which is

exempliﬁed by Fig. 5. We can calculate the quantity

C(t) = C(t, ϕ = π/8)

C(t, ϕ = π/2).

(41)

A2(0, π/2)

Evidently, C(t) represents a weighted sum of the OCFs of the rank j = 4 and higher. Since

the higher-rank contributions into C(t) decrease rapidly with σ (Fig. 3) one expects that

C(t) is determined, predominantly, by G4(t). This qualitative expectation is corroborated

13

by Fig. 5. Evidently, C(t) and G4(t) do not coincide but, as has been explained above, their

slopes are virtually the same.

The procedure described above can also be applied to the high-NA detection, see Fig. 6.

Furthermore, the situation is much more fortunate in this case, since the orthogonal CF is

now solely determined by the second rank OCF G2(t) (A2(π/2, π/2) = 1, see also Fig. 3). It

is interesting that CFs C(t, ϕ = π/4) and C(t, ϕ = π/2), which are presented in the Fig. 6,

are rather close to each other, since both of them are predominantly determined by G2(t).

However, the CF

C(t) = C(t, ϕ = π/4)

A2(π/2, π/4)C(t, ϕ = π/2)

(42)

−

is almost indistinguishable from G4(t).

The above results demonstrate that the proposed (or similar) procedure of the extraction

of high-order OCFs from the SM CF C(t) is useful and robust, both for high- and low NA

objectives. Once the higher order OCFs are available, one can get valuable information

on the dynamics of the SM reorientation. For example, let us suppose that orientational

relaxation proceeds exponentially. Then, if the second-rank OCF is available only, one can

extract an eﬀective time of the OCF decay, but cannot learn anything about rotational

dynamics.

If both G2(t) and G4(t) are known, one then can calculate the ratio of their

relaxation times. This quantity, being very model-speciﬁc, allows one to discriminate be-

tween diﬀerent reorientation mechanisms. For the small-angle diﬀusion model, the ratio

equals to 10/3 (see Eq.(40)). For the jump diﬀusion model, it is close to 1.33,37,38 More

sophisticated approaches to the orientational relaxation2,3,25,45,46,47,48,49 also predict that the

comparison of the behavior of OCFs of diﬀerent ranks makes it possible to identify the

underling mechanisms of orientational relaxation.

Before concluding the present section, we wish to discuss possible causes of the deviation

of C(t) from the exponential form (see also Refs.23,24). There can be two fundamentally

diﬀerent groups of reasons. First, C(t) is described by the weighted sum of the even-rank

OCFs, Eq.(38). Despite the second-rank OCF contributes predominately into C(t), the

contributions due to the higher-rank OCFs cannot be neglected, in general. It is only for a

high-NA objective and close-to-orthogonal detection scheme that these higher order contri-

butions are vanishingly small and C(t)

G2(t). Second, the OCFs (including the second-

rank OCF) can be non-exponential due to a variety of reasons. (i). Molecular rotation is

∼

14

not necessarily diﬀusive. While the jump diﬀusion model predicts exponentially decaying

OCFs33,37,38 (although their rank-dependence diﬀers from that given by Eq.(35)), the re-

stricted diﬀusion model,45,46 the diﬀusion-equation-with-memory models and other memory

function approaches47,48,49 predict the OCFs of a spherical molecule to be described by the

sum of several (in general, complex) exponentials. More sophisticated approaches deliver, of

course, more complex OCFs. On the other hand, the so-called inertial eﬀects, which induce

highly non-exponential behavior of OCFs,2,3,25 are irrelevant for the SM spectroscopy since

they manifest themselves on a time scale which is much faster than the time resolution of

typical SM experiments. (ii). A deviation of the molecular shape from spherical complicates

molecular reorientation even in the small angle diﬀusion limit. The second-rank OCF G2

00(t)
of an asymmetric top, for example, is described by the sum of two exponentials.42,50 (iii). Of

relevance is the direction of the emission dipole moment µ in the molecular reference frame

(see Eqs. (33) and (34)). For example, if µ is parallel to the axis of the linear or symmetric

rotor, the corresponding second-rank OCF is mono-exponential. If µ is perpendicular to the

molecular axis, then the corresponding OCF is two-exponential (see Eq.(35)). (iv). Finally,

internal rotations can also cause deviations from exponentiality.46

VII. CONCLUSION

We have developed an approach for the calculation of the SM CF C(t), Eq.(28), in

the general case of asymmetric top molecules. The key dynamic quantities of our analysis

are the even-rank OCFs Gj(t) (25), the weighted sum of which constitutes C(t). The

OCFs can either be evaluated within any model of molecular reorientation available in the

literature2,3,25 or simulated on a computer.26 We have demonstrated that the use of non-

orthogonal schemes for the detection of SM polarization responses allows one to manipulate

the weighting coeﬃcients in the expansion of C(t) on OCFs. Thus a valuable information

about the OCFs of the rank higher than second can be extracted from the SM CF C(t).

Until recently, such an information was available only through computer simulations and/or

model calculations. Neither the corresponding information is accessible within the ensemble-

averaged spectroscopy, in which one “measures” exclusively the second-rank OCF (36).

Abstract

The heats of formation of HClO4 and Cl2O7 have been determined to chemical accuracy for

the ﬁrst time by means of W1 and W2 theory. These molecules exhibit particularly severe

degrees of inner polarization, and as such obtaining a basis-set limit SCF component to the

total atomization energy becomes a challenge. (Adding high-exponent d functions to a standard

spd basis set has an eﬀect on the order of 100 kcal/mol for Cl2O7.) Wilson’s aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z

basis sets represent a dramatic improvement over the standard aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets, while

the aug-cc-pVnZ+2d1f sequence converges still more rapidly. Jensen’s polarization consistent

basis sets still require additional high-exponent d functions: for smooth convergence we suggest

the {aug-pc1+3d,aug-pc2+2d,aug-pc3+d,aug-pc4} sequence. The role of the tight d functions

is shown to be an improved description of the Cl (3d) Rydberg orbital, enhancing its ability

to receive back-bonding from the oxygen lone pairs. In problematic cases like this (or indeed in

general), a single SCF/aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f calculation may be preferable over empirically motivated

extrapolations. Our best estimate heats of formation are ∆H ◦f,298[HClO4(g)] = −0.6±1 kcal/mol

and ∆H ◦f,298[Cl2O7(g)] = 65.9±2 kcal/mol, the largest source of uncertainty being our inability to

account for post-CCSD(T) correlation eﬀects. While G2 and G3 theory have fairly large errors,

G3X theory reproduces both values to within 2 kcal/mol.

INTRODUCTION

The author’s Dirac medal lecture at WATOC′05 focused on some recent advances in the

area of computational thermochemistry in general, and on the Wn (Weizmann-n) theory[1,

2, 3, 4] developed in our own laboratory in particular. The subject has been reviewed very

recently[5] and therefore will not be re-reviewed here. Rather, we will present an example

practical application.

Perchloric acid, HClO4, and its anhydride, Cl2O7, have been known for nearly two

centuries[6].

Industrial uses of perchloric acid are manifold, and higher chlorine oxides

have recently been implicated in theories of stratospheric destruction of ozone[7]. (See also

two recent papers [8, 9] on the Cl2On and Br2On series (n=1–4) and their anions.) Yet no

reliable thermochemical data are available: the reason for this is probably best illustrated

by the following quote from a spectroscopic study[10]:

Caution! Several explosions occurred during the course of this work. It was

necessary to perform all experiments wearing heavy gloves and a face shield with

the sample properly shielded.

Cioslowski et al. compiled[11] an extensive and chemically diverse set of thermochemical

data for the purpose of benchmarking, calibration, and parametrization of computational

thermochemistry methods. Their dataset includes Cl2O7, for which an unsourced value

of ∆H ◦f,298=65.0 kcal/mol was taken from the Wagman et al. compilation[12]. An atom-

equivalent scheme based on B3LYP/6-311++G** calculations proposed in Ref.[11] yielded

its single largest error (91 kcal/mol) for this molecule. While it is to be expected that this

molecule will exhibit very strong inner polarization eﬀects[13, 14], it must also be said that

the 65.0 kcal/mol number is a crude estimate, and that any comparison with it will be

semiquantitative at best.

For HClO4, Francisco[15] quotes ∆H ◦f,298=4±4 kcal/mol from the NIST database[16], and

a group additivity estimate[17] of -1.5 kcal/mol. Francisco himself calculated ∆H ◦f,0=+10.8

kcal/mol using G2 theory. Similar remarks apply as for Cl2O7.

In the present work, we will apply W1 and W2 theory to these systems. We will also show

that they are extreme cases of inner polarization eﬀects[13, 14] and that any calculation that

does not adequately take this into account is doomed to failure.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

All calculations were run on a 4-CPU AMD Opteron 846 server with 8 GB of RAM,

two SATA system disks, and eight 72 GB UltraSCSI320 scratch disks, running SuSE Linux

Enterprise Server 9 and custom-built for our group by Access Technologies of Reh. ovot, Israel.
The scratch disks are operated as two hardware RAID-0 arrays of four disks aggregated in

software using the Linux “md” facility. For large soft-RAID ”chunk sizes” of 512 KB and

up, we are able to obtain sustained streaming read and write bandwidth in excess of 300

MB/s, as measured by IOzone[18] for a 16 GB ﬁle.

The CCSD[19] and CCSD(T)[20, 21] coupled cluster calculations involved in W1 and W2

theory were carried out using MOLPRO 2002.6[22] (always using conventional rather than

integral-direct algorithms), while all remaining calculations were carried out using a locally

modiﬁed version of Gaussian 03[23]. NBO (natural bond orbital)[24] and AIM (atoms-in-

molecules)[25] analyses were carried out using the relevant modules of Gaussian 03.

Three families of basis sets were used. The ﬁrst are the original aug-cc-pVnZ (augmented

correlation consistent polarized n-tuple zeta) basis sets of Dunning and coworkers[26]:

besides the unmodiﬁed aug-cc-pVnZ sequence, we considered the aug-cc-pVnZ+2d1f

sequence proposed in the original W1/W2 paper[1], where the“+2d1f” notation represents

the addition of two additional d and one additional f function, with exponents obtained by

successively multiplying the highest exponent of that angular momentum already present

by a factor of 2.5.

The second family are the aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets of Wilson, Peterson, and

Dunning[27], which were speciﬁcally developed to cope with inner polarization eﬀects and

contain an additional d function beyond the original aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets.

The third family are the aug-pcn (augmented polarization consistent) basis sets of

Jensen[28, 29, 30, 31]. Unlike the correlation consistent basis sets which were developed

for optimum recovery of the valence correlation energy, the polarization consistent basis

sets were developed for optimum recovery of Hartree-Fock and DFT energies, for which

requirements (in terms of optimum exponents and choice of polarization functions) are

considerably diﬀerent. We considered the aug-pc1, aug-pc2, aug-pc3, and aug-pc4 basis sets,

which are of 3s2p, 4s3p2d, 6s5p3d2f , and 8s7p4d3f 2g quality, respectively, on hydrogen, of

4s3p2d, 5s4p3d2f , 7s6p5d3f 2g, and 9s8p7d4f 3g2h quality, respectively, on oxygen, and of

3

5s4p2d, 6s5p3d2f , 7s6p5d3f 2g, and 8s7p7d4f 3g2h quality, respectively, on chlorine. Here

too, we considered addition of one or more high-exponent d and f functions (denoted by

“+d”, “+2d”,. . . suﬃxes), with exponents again in even-tempered sequences with a stride

factor of 2.5.

Detailed descriptions (and rationales) for the diﬀerent steps in W1 and W2 theory can be

found in the original references[1, 2, 3, 4]. In the interest of making the paper self-contained,

we will brieﬂy summarize them:

• a B3LYP/cc-pV(T+d)Z[32] reference geometry is used for W1 theory. Normally

a CCSD(T)/cc-pV(Q+d)Z reference geometry is called for in W2 theory: as full

CCSD(T)/cc-pV(Q+d)Z optimizations proved computationally intractable, we have

instead used the best available DFT geometries[49] (at the B97-1/aug-pc3+d level[33]).

The actual geometries used can be found in Figure 1;

• the SCF component is extrapolated from aug-cc-pVTZ+2d1f and aug-cc-pVQZ+2d1f

basis sets in W1 theory, and from aug-cc-pVQZ+2d1f and aug-cc-pV5Z+2d1f basis

sets in W2 theory, using the formula[2] E(L) = E

+ A/L5; The acronyms W1w and

∞

W2w (rather than W1 and W2) indicate that aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z rather than aug-cc-

pVnZ+2d1f basis sets were used[4];

• the CCSD valence correlation component is extrapolated from the same pairs of basis

sets using E(L) = E

+ A/Lα, where α = 3.22 for W1 and W1w theory and α = 3

for W2 theory[1, 34, 35];

∞

• the (T) valence correlation component is extrapolated using the same expression, but

from aug-cc-pVDZ+2d and aug-cc-pVTZ+2d1f basis sets in the case of W1 theory,

and aug-cc-pVTZ+2d1f and aug-cc-pVQZ+2d1f basis sets for W2 theory (with the

appropriate substitutions in the case of W1w and W2w). Note that the expensive (T)

step need not be carried out in the largest basis set used overall. Note also that ROHF

references are used for the open-shell atoms, and that the deﬁnition of Ref.[21] for the

ROHF-CCSD(T) energy is used;

• the diﬀerential contribution of inner-shell correlation is obtained at the CCSD(T) level

with a specially developed MTsmall core correlation basis set[1, 36];

4

• the scalar relativistic contribution can be obtained either as ﬁrst-order mass-velocity

and Darwin corrections[37] at the ACPF (averaged coupled pair functional[38]) level

with the MTsmall basis set, or (in the Gaussian 03[23] implementation of W1 theory

and in the present work) as the diﬀerence between nonrelativistic and second-order

Douglas-Kroll-Hess[39] CCSD(T)/MTsmall energies;

• These being closed-shell molecules, ﬁrst-order spin-orbit corrections only aﬀect the

separated atoms and are obtained from the well-established atomic ﬁne structures;

• The zero-point vibrational energy was obtained from scaled B3LYP/cc-pV(T+d)Z

harmonic frequencies for W1w theory, and from a recent DFT anharmonic force ﬁeld

study[49] for W2w theory;

• Thermal corrections were obtained from the same data, although corrections are

required for the hindered rotations in both molecules (see below).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The reference geometries used are given in Figure 1. Most salient results can be found in

Table 1: basis set convergence for the SCF component is presented in detail in Table 2. We

shall discuss these results component by component.

A. Hartree-Fock component

Normally, the Hartree-Fock component is the easiest one to get right in an ab initio

thermochemistry calculation. Yet in this case, very strong inner polarization eﬀects cause a

sharp dependence of the Hartree-Fock component of the binding energy on the presence of

high-exponent d functions in the basis set. This can be seen in more detail in Table 2.

For HClO4 with the aug-cc-pVDZ or aug-pc1 basis sets, addition of four high-exponent d

functions (with exponents in an even-tempered series with stride 2.5) increases the computed

binding energy by over 50 kcal/mol:

for Cl2O7, the magnitude of the eﬀect reaches a

whopping 100 kcal/mol!

With aug-cc-pVTZ (or aug-pc2) and spdf g basis sets, the contributions for Cl2O7 go down

to 45 and 23 kcal/mol, respectively — the aug-pc3 basis set already contains one additional

5

high-exponent d function to begin with, and thus requires less additional d functions to

reach saturation.

An NBO analysis of the wave function reveals that, while the chlorine d orbitals have

natural populations in the 0.35 range, these orbitals have Rydberg character and do not

participate in any natural bond orbitals: as shown repeatedly previously[40, 41], there is

no basis for describing HClO4, nor by extension Cl2O7, as hypervalent molecules. NPA,

APT (Atomic Polar Tensor[42]), and AIM all yield partial charges consistent with a general

HO(Cl+3)(–O−)3 bonding picture (see below).

What happens to the wavefunction when extra d functions are added? Comparing NBO

analyses for HClO4 with aug-pc1 and aug-pc1+3d basis sets, we see that the energy of the

3d Rydberg orbital on Cl is lowered from 0.985 to 0.839 a.u.

for dxy, 0.974 to 0.830 a.u.

for dxz, 1.200 to 1.016 a.u. for dyz, 1.134 to 0.966 a.u. for dx2

y2, and 1.173 to 0.996 a.u.

−

for d3z2

r2. Thus the orbitals become more accessible: overall 3d population increases from

−

0.28 to 0.37 electron equivalents, with the corresponding NBO occupations clustering in a

”quasi-t2g” triad of 0.117, 0.103, and 0.100 and a ”quasi-eg” dyad of 0.0594 and 0.0588.

(These numbers add up to more than 0.37 as there are small non-d components in these

orbitals.) Interestingly, the Wiberg bond indices for the three short Cl–O bonds go up by

about 0.05, and of the long bond by 0.02. The increase in the AIM (Bader) covalent bond

orders is more pronounced: from 1.27 to 1.42–1.43 for the short bonds, and from 1.00 to 1.05

for the long bond. Second-order perturbation theory analysis of the NBOs reveals, besides

the expected interactions between oxygen lone pairs and antibonding ClO orbitals, strong

interactions between oxygen lone pairs and the 3d Rydberg orbitals on chlorine.

Consistent with all of this, the AIM charge distribution is considerably less polarized with

versus without the extra d functions (δ(Cl)=3.51 and 3.92, respectively). The NPA charges

are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected (δ(Cl)=2.68 in both cases), while the APT charges actually

show a mild opposite trend (2.58 vs. 2.53).

Summing up, the chemical signiﬁcance of the extra d functions is thus that they improve

the ability of the 3d orbital to act as an acceptor for backbonding from the oxygen lone pair

orbitals. This situation is, in fact, somewhat reminescent of the role of the 3d orbital in the

CaO molecule[43, 44].

As a result of all this, basis set convergence for the aug-cc-pVnZ series is quite

unsatisfactory. Somewhat more satisfying results are obtained with the Wilson-Peterson-

6

Dunning aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z series, although even here, there is still an unusually large

increment of 0.68 kcal/mol (for Cl2O7: 1.29 kcal/mol) between the aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z and

aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z basis sets. With the aug-cc-pVnZ+2d1f series advocated in the original

W1/W2 paper[1], convergence is rather more satisfactory: the aug-cc-pV5Z+2d1f basis set

actually yields a larger binding energy (78.81 kcal/mol) than the aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z and aug-

cc-pV6Z+d basis set (78.70 and 78.76 kcal/mol, respectively). Our best directly computed

value, with the aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f basis set, is only 0.05 kcal/mol greater. Note that the

contribution of the high-exponent f function decays rapidly in the aug-cc-pVnZ+2d1f series:

from 0.98 kcal/mol for n=T to 0.02 kcal/mol for n=6. Note also that even for the aug-cc-

pV6Z+d basis set, adding a second hard d function still contributes 0.08 kcal/mol.

Turning to Jensen’s polarization consistent basis sets — which were speciﬁcally developed

for SCF or DFT applications rather than for correlated ab initio calculations — we still see

a 0.58 kcal/mol increment between uncontracted aug-pc3+d and aug-pc4 basis sets. (Jensen

recommends using uncontracted basis sets for SCF energy extrapolations.) Using Jensen’s

recommended extrapolation formula[29] from aug-pc2+2d, aug-pc3+d, and aug-pc4 data

(see footnote c to Table 1 for details), we obtain a best estimate for TAE(SCF)=78.94

kcal/mol: for comparison, the best directly computed values are 78.70 kcal/mol for aug-cc-

pV(6+d)Z, 78.84 kcal/mol for aug-cc-pV6Z+2d, 78.86 kcal/mol for aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f, and

78.77 kcal/mol for uncontracted aug-pc4.

Using the aug-cc-pV{5,6}Z+2d1f data instead with the A + B/L5 extrapolation used in

W2 theory, we obtain 78.89 kcal/mol as our limit: taking into account Jensen’s observation

that the SCF energy for such large basis sets appears to converge much faster than L5 (see

also Ref.[45]), we take the average of this extrapolation and the raw aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f

value, to ﬁnally obtain TAE(SCF)=78.88 kcal/mol. The W1w extrapolation falls far short

at 76.35 kcal/mol, while the performance of the W2w extrapolation, 78.61 kcal/mol, could

be deemed acceptable. (With the ”+2d1f” basis set series of standard W2 theory, we would

obtain 79.09 kcal/mol, which overshoots the true limit.) Using the eﬃcient direct SCF codes

presently available, it might well be that the preferred approach for the SCF component in

problematic cases like this — rather than an extrapolation on purely empirical grounds —

would be to carry out a single straight SCF calculation with the largest routinely feasible

basis set. Even in the present extreme case, using the raw SCF/aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f or

SCF/aug-pc4+d numbers causes errors under 0.1 kcal/mol.

7

An SCF/aug-cc-pV6Z+2d1f calculation on Cl2O7, which requires no less than 1,743

basis functions, yields TAE(SCF)=-30.81 kcal/mol. A + B/L5 extrapolation yields -30.76

kcal/mol, averaging as for HClO4 -30.79 kcal/mol. (The raw SCF/aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z and

SCF/aug-pc4 values are in error by 0.31 and 0.19 kcal/mol, respectively, suggesting aug-

cc-pV6Z+2d1f to be the basis set of choice for ”single point” SCF limit calculations.) In

terms of convergence along basis set sequences, the same trends as for HClO4 are seen in

ampliﬁed form. We note in passing that the SCF reaction energy of the isodesmic reaction

2 HClO4 → Cl2O7 + H2O converges quite rapidly with the basis, as long as at least one

hard d function is present.

B. Valence correlation energy

As noted previously for SO2 and SO3,[14, 46] basis set convergence for the valence

correlation component is not anomalous for molecules with severe inner polarization. As

for any molecule with highly polar bonds, however (see, e.g., SiF4 [47], BF3 [48], and the

like), a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between W1w and W2w is to be expected. In the case of HClO4,

the discrepancy for the CCSD correlation energy is quite modest at 0.5 kcal/mol, and it is

partly compensated by a discrepancy of -0.2 kcal/mol for the connected triple excitations

contribution.

Even a CCSD/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z calculation on Cl2O7 was only barely feasible with the

available hardware: CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z and CCSD/aug-cc-pV(5+d)Z calculations

are plainly impossible. Considering the good agreement between W1 and W2 for the

valence correlation contributions, however, we can safely assume that this component is

well reproduced for the isodesmic reaction.

Neither molecule shows any obvious sign of severe static correlation, neither from the

T

∞

diagnostics[50] (0.019 for HClO4, 0.021 for Cl2O7), nor from the largest coupled cluster

amplitudes. Yet the fact that three-quarters of the atomization energy of HClO4 results from

correlation, and that Cl2O7 is actually slightly metastable at the Hartree-Fock level, suggest

that higher-order correlation eﬀects could be somewhat important for these molecules.

Unfortunately, a W3 calculation for HClO4 — let alone Cl2O7 — is absolutely impossible

with the present state of technology. This appears to be the single greatest source of

uncertainty in our calculations.

8

C.

Inner-shell correlation energy

Like with other second-row molecules, despite the rather large absolute inner-shell

correlation energies, the inner-shell contribution to the molecular binding energy is rather

small (0.90 kcal/mol for HClO4). A CCSD(T)/MTsmall calculation on Cl2O7 is not feasible.

We were able to carry out a CCSD(T)/cc-pwCVTZ calculation, but this basis set is clearly

woefully inadequate for HClO4, recovering only about half the contribution. We might be

able to rely on error compensation for the isodesmic reaction, and the inner-shell correlation

contribution to its reaction energy is found to be -0.18 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T)/cc-

pwCVTZ level. From the higher-level results for HClO4 and H2O, we can then extract a

best estimate of 1.38 kcal/mol for the inner-shell contribution to the Cl2O7 binding energy.

D. Relativistic eﬀects

The original W1 and W2 protocols called for mass-velocity and Darwin corrections from

ACPF/MTsmall calculations. W3 theory, as well as the W1 and W2 implementations in

the popular Gaussian 03 program package, use CCSD(T) calculations with the Douglas-

Kroll approximation to obtain the scalar relativistc contribution. We have followed the

same (more rigorous) approach here, as the scalar relativistic contributions are generally

signiﬁcant for this type of molecule (second-row atoms in high oxidation states surrounded

by strongly electronegative elements). At the DK-CCSD(T)/MTsmall level, we ﬁnd -2.69

kcal/mol for HClO4 and a hefty -4.80 kcal/mol for Cl2O7. For HClO4, we recalculated the

contribution using relativistically optimized correlation consistent basis sets[4] of AVTZ and

AVQZ quality. We obtain fundamentally the same result, and upon extrapolation to the

inﬁnite-basis limit, we actually reproduce the MTsmall result to two decimal places. We

therefore have not attempted any DK-CCSD(T)/AVQZ calculation for Cl2O7: for the sake

of completeness, the DK-CCSD(T)/AVTZ value is -4.73 kcal/mol.

The ﬁrst-order spin-orbit contribution results exclusively from the atomic ﬁne structures

and requires no further comment. We expect second-order spin-orbit coupling corrections

to be on the order of 0.1 kcal/mol or less, well below the more important potential error

sources in these calculations.

9

E. Zero-point and thermal corrections

The scaled B3LYP/cc-pV(T+d)Z harmonic frequencies normally used for the zero-point

energy in W1w theory is clearly falling short a bit in these cases. From a very recent

DFT anharmonic force ﬁeld study[49] on both molecules, we have available anharmonic

ZPVEs at the B97-1/aug-pc3+d level. Our ”best estimate” value for HClO4 was obtained

by combining the anharmonic ZPVE with one-half the diﬀerence between the computed and

observed fundamental frequencies. For Cl2O7 the assignment of the experimental vibrational

spectrum is too fraught with ambiguities to allow for the same approach: here we have

assumed the ratio between the ”best estimate” and directly computed ZPVEs for HClO4 to

be transferable to Cl2O7.

The thermal correction represents the minor complication of hindered ClO3 rotations. In

the case of HClO4, we ﬁnd the internal rotation barrier V to be 0.647 kcal/mol at the B97-

1/aug-pc2+2d level, which corresponds to a V /RT ratio of nearly one. At the same level,

we obtain a reduced moment for the internal rotor of 2.9853 amu.bohr2. With a de-facto

rotor periodicity of three, we obtain 1/Qf = 0.52 from eq.(4) of Pitzer and Gwinn[51]. By

interpolating their Table V, we obtain 1.054 e.u., or 0.53 R, for Eintrot/T , i.e., very close

to the free rotor limit of R/2 and considerably removed from the low-frequency harmonic

vibration limit of R. Our ‘best estimate’ values reﬂect this correction for HClO4, and twice

this correction for Cl2O7. Clearly, it will cancel in the isodesmic reaction.

F. Heats of formation

Our ﬁnal best estimate for the heat of formation of HClO4 is -0.6 kcal/mol. We expect

this value to be accurate to about 1 kcal/mol, with the largest potential source of error

being post-CCSD(T) correlation eﬀects.

This value actually agrees quite well with Colussi and Grela’s group additivity estimate

of -1.5 kcal/mol. The large discrepancy between the G2 theory[52] result of Francisco[15],

∆H ◦f,0 =+10.8 kcal/mol and our own absolute-zero heat of formation of 2.4 kcal/mol should
not be surprising considering the extreme basis set sensitivity pointed out here. Using

the more up-to-date G3 theory[53], we obtain TAE0=307.9 kcal/mol (compared to 305.4

kcal/mol for G2), or 306.2 kcal/mol after applying the atomic spin-orbit correction (-

10

1.73 kcal/mol): G3 thus still underbinds the molecule by 7.6 kcal/mol compared to our

best estimate (TAE0=313.8 kcal/mol). G3X theory[54], which was recently developed in

an attempt to (inter alia) reduce errors for (pseudo)hypervalent compounds, recovers an

additional 5.64 kcal/mol worth of binding energy and thus reduces the error to a respectable

2 kcal/mol. While G3 uses an MP2/6-31G* reference geometry (which will have very

substantial basis set incompleteness error for this type of molecules), G3X uses B3LYP/6-

31G(2df,2p) — in particular the extra d function very signiﬁcantly aﬀects the computed

reference geometry. In addition, G3X involves a step where a single g function is added to

the basis set at the HF level: this does aﬀect the energy by 2.01 kcal/mol, which appears to

be a slight overestimate, as we ﬁnd the g function contribution in the aug-pc3 basis set to

be only 1.45 kcal/mol.

Our best estimated heat of formation for Cl2O7 (obtained from the W1w isodesmic

reaction energy and our best calculated data for HClO4 and H2O) is 65.9 kcal/mol, to

which we attach a conservative error bar of 2 kcal/mol. This is actually quite close to

the Wagman et al.[12] estimate of ∆H ◦f,298=65.0 kcal/mol and the R¨uhl et al.[55] mass

spectrometric value of 65±4 kcal/mol. Li et al.[56] used a variety of methods from the G2

and G3 family, and found 76.8 kcal/mol at the G3 level, 84.9 kcal/mol at the G3(MP3) level,

and 66.7 kcal/mol at the G2(MP2) level, which is fortuitously in much better agreement

with our best value than the more sophisticated G3-based methods. Once again, we ﬁnd

that G3X theory puts in a much better performance: after spin-orbit correction, we obtain

TAE0=399.47 kcal/mol, again within 2 kcal/mol of our best estimate. The G3X g function

is found to account for 3.94 kcal/mol (once again, an overestimate compared to the 2.86

kcal/mol from the g functions in the aug-pc3 basis set), with most of the rest once again

being accounted for by the superior reference geometry.

Sicre and Cobos[57] obtained 93.1 kcal/mol at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3d2f) level, 78.9

kcal/mol at the mPW1PW91 level with the same basis set, 86.2 kcal/mol at the

G3(MP2)//B3LYP level and 79.5 kcal/mol at the G3(MP2)//B3LYP/6-311+G(3d2f) level.

These same authors’ best estimate, from isodesmic reaction schemes,

is 61.5 kcal/mol,

appreciably below our best estimate.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The heats of

formation of HClO4 and Cl2O7 have been determined to chemical

accuracy for the ﬁrst time by means of W1 and W2 theory. These molecules exhibit

particularly severe degrees of inner polarization, and as such obtaining a basis-set limit SCF

component to the total atomization energy becomes a challenge. (Adding high-exponent

d functions to a standard spd basis set has an eﬀect on the order of 100 kcal/mol for

Cl2O7.) Wilson’s aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets represent a dramatic improvement over the

standard aug-cc-pVnZ basis sets, while the aug-cc-pVnZ+2d1f sequence converges still more

rapidly. Jensen’s polarization consistent basis sets still require additional high-exponent d

functions: for smooth convergence we suggest the {aug-pc1+3d,aug-pc2+2d,aug-pc3+d,aug-

pc4} sequence. The role of the tight d functions is shown to be an improved description

of the Cl (3d) Rydberg orbital, enhancing its ability to receive back-bonding from the

oxygen lone pairs. In problematic cases like this (or indeed in general), a single SCF/aug-

cc-pV6Z+2d1f calculation may be preferable over empirically motivated extrapolations.

Our best estimate heats of formation are ∆H ◦f,298[HClO4(g)] = −0.6±1 kcal/mol and
∆H ◦f,298[Cl2O7(g)] = 65.9±2 kcal/mol, the largest source of uncertainty being our inability

to account for post-CCSD(T) correlation eﬀects. While G2 and G3 theory have fairly large

errors, G3X theory reproduces both values to within 2 kcal/mol.

Abstract

The primary relaxation in glass forming supercooled liquids (SCLs)

above the glass transformation temperature Tg is discussed in terms of the

ﬁrst-order (steepness) and the second-order (curvature) temperature deriva-

tives of the observed primary relaxation timescale. We report new insights

into the problem of the domain of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VFT) equa-

tion, raised by Stickel et al.

(J. Chem. Phys. 102, 6251 (1995), ibid.

104, 2043 (1996)) and discussed by Richert and Angell (ibid. 108, 9016

(1998)). A new ergodic-cluster Gaussian statistical approach to the prob-

lem is given based on Onsager’s thermodynamic principle. The primary

relaxation is described by the VFT equation below the crossover temper-

ature Tc (known from mode coupling theory (MCT)), and above Tc by an

extended (VFTE) equation obtained after accounting for cluster-size ﬂuc-

tuations. The timescale is parametrized by a ﬁnite number of observable

1

parameters such as the steepness function (mT ) at Tg , the MCT slowing-

down exponent γc, and the VFT and VFTE strength indices Dg and Dc.

The latter are deﬁned at Tg and Tc, respectively, for the strongly and mod-

erately SCL states, which show absolute thermodynamic instability at the

same VFT temperature T0, associated with the Kauzmann temperature.

For both states the limiting cluster-size characteristics are derived from

experiment. A thermodynamic-dynamic correspondence is established be-

tween the dynamic VFT equation and the thermodynamic Adam and Gibbs

model. As a by-product, self-consistent equations for the excess heat capac-

ity, entropy, and for the glass-transition characteristic temperatures T0, Tg,

and Tc are deduced. The problem of the ”irregular” SCLs, which are not

consistent with the standard VFT equation, such as salol, ortho-terphenyl,

and bis-methoxy-phenyl-cyclohexane, is also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The understanding of noncrystalline liquids and the formation of glasses by a dynamical

slowing-down, and a rapid increase in viscosity at the glass transition temperatures Tg (near

2/3 of the melting point Tm) is currently seen as a major intellectual challenge in condensed

matter physics [1]. There is therefore intense interest in studies, experimental and theo-

retical, including simulations, of the temperature dependence of the transport properties of

supercooled liquids (SCLs). In particular, data on the primary relaxation times τ (exp)

that

T

are determined from dynamic experiments that study viscoelastic, dielectric, conductivity,

light scattering and mechanical relaxation data of glass formers [2], oﬀer one of the main

keys to the problem [1,3–5].

Unlike the slow secondary relaxation process which has a constant activation energy

24kBTg (established in Ref. [6] for the Arrhenius relaxation, where kB is Boltzmann’s

≈
factor), the thermally equilibrated SCL states, observed within the temperature domain

T < Tm, exhibit a pseudo-Arrhenius form, i.e., τT = τ∞ exp(ET /kBT ), and are dis-

Tg ≤
cussed traditionally in terms of the SCL activation energy ET . The most widely employed

Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) timescale ﬁtting phenomenological form with the activation

energy ET = B/(T

T0) is introduced by the ﬁctive critical temperature Tcr (= T0, VFT

−

temperature). T0 lies below the thermodynamic glass transition temperature Tg established

by thermodynamic experiments such as scanning calorimetric or volume-expansion data.

Analysis of the temperature-derivative behavior of the α-relaxation timescale τT given by

Stickel et al. in Refs. [7–9], as improved and extended by Richert and Angell’s analysis of

the thermodynamic data in Ref. [10], determined the real temperature observation domain,

or observation window, of the VFT form. Overall τT ﬁtting forms, distinct from the VFT,

were proposed within the whole SCL observation window by Kivelson et al. in Ref.11 or by

Schulz in Ref. [12] that, respectively, admits the ”avoided critical points” [13] (Tcr > Tm),

or rules out the non-zero critical temperatures (Tcr = 0).

Within the context of ﬁrst-and-second-order phase-transition approaches to the problem

3

of the liquid-to-glass transition (see Refs. [14–23]) the dramatic increase of the relaxation

times τ (exp)

T

observed in SCLs upon cooling, is due to the growth of underlying correlation-

length scales. The lengthscale peculiarities, even when being experimentally established,

do not often lead to a clear physical understanding.

In the case of the VFT form the

physical meaning of the experimentally determined VFT temperature T0, is justiﬁed by its

closeness to the thermodynamic Kauzmann temperature TK. At this critical temperature

(TK = Tcr) the excess liquid-over-solid SCL entropy, or conﬁgurational entropy, vanishes.

This property is thought to be associated with the absolute thermodynamic instability of

the thermally equilibrated states of the SCLs with respect to liquid-to-solid rearranging

processes that extend from the ergodic region (Tg ≤
theoretically motivated ergodic instability (caused by divergence of the zero moment of the

T < Tm) to lower temperatures. The

relevant relaxation-time distribution function [19]) establishes the thermodynamic-dynamic

(TD-D) correspondence equation, T (T D)

= T (D)

K

T0. This equation was experimentally

0 ≡

justiﬁed by Angell [3] within a certain range of experimental scatter which often lies [24]

inside the error of experimentally measured characteristic temperatures.

Thermodynamic models for SCLs are commonly tested by the τ (exp)

ﬁtting analysis. The

T

VFT form has proved to be ineﬀective for establishing simultaneously all three adjustable

parameters (τ (V F T )

∞

, B and T0) within the overall ﬁtting analysis of the observed SCL vis-

cosity (see discussion in Ref. [11]). An improved analysis for the tested forms was proposed

in Refs. [7–9] on the basis of ﬁtting experimental data τ (exp)

and additionally their ﬁrst-

T

order (d log τ (exp)

/dT ) and second-order (d2 log τ (exp)

/dT 2) derivatives. These temperature-

T

T

derivative analyses permit one to exclude the unknown ﬁtting parameters, step-by-step, by

making the three-parameter ﬁtting procedure self-consistent. As a result, the validity of the

VFT form, when tested within the whole ergodic relaxation range, was questioned [9] for all

SCLs investigated above the so-called α-β-relaxation bifurcation temperature TB. Notably,

this crossover temperature was often found close to other known crossover temperatures Tx

and Tc introduced, respectively, as a scaling temperature by R¨ossler and co-workers [25]

and as the dynamic critical temperature of the mode coupling theory (MCT). Within these

4

studies one can admit that to a good approximation, TB = Tx = Tc (see e.g. Table II in Ref.

[10]).

Physically, the MCT crossover temperature Tc signals structural transformations, or

liquid-solid-like restructuring in SCLs, from moderately supercooled states of ”weakly cou-

T < Tm) to strongly supercooled states of ”strongly coupled ﬂuids”

pled ﬂuids” (Tc ≤
(Tg ≤
ﬁrst order derivatives (related to the timescale steepness) and the second-order derivatives

T < Tc) as discussed in Ref. [4]. The analyses given in Refs. [7–10] in terms of the

(related to the timescale curvature) of the temperature dependence, clearly distinguish the

two regions, similar to the case of the MCT theory [4], below and above the dynamical

crossover temperature TB, associated here with Tc. The data for moderately SCL (or weak-

SCL) states in all glass forming liquids that have been studied are in a good quantitative

agreement with the modiﬁed VFT form given as the high-T VFT (HT-VFT) version in the

old canonical VFT form but with new adjustable parameters, including the HT-VFT char-

acteristic temperature T (HT )

(

0

≈

Tg, see Table II in Ref. [8]). This fundamental ﬁnding is

exempliﬁed by the case of the simple molecular liquid propylene carbonate (PC) in Fig.1. As

seen from the analysis given in Fig.1, the validity of the canonical VFT form is limited by the

temperature domain Tg ≤

Another interesting description of the SL states is also provided by analysis of the ther-

modynamic (heat capacity) data that was elucidated by Richert and Angell [10] on the basis

of the conﬁgurational entropy Sc data. This data is schematically plotted in Fig.2.

Careful complex dynamic-thermodynamic analyses enabled one to establish a physical

meaning for the standard VFT ﬁtting form, that was justiﬁed in terms of the thermodynamic

Adam-Gibbs model (AGM) introduced in Ref. [14]. The VFT form is therefore treated as the

VFT equation that provides a good description of the observed dynamic and thermodynamic

relaxation of the strong-SCL states (see AG-line in Fig.2). Within the context of percolation

theory [26], T0 may be associated with the critical temperature where the correlation length

of the strong-SCL states diverges in accordance with the thermodynamic instability at the

5

Kauzmann temperature TK. A microscopic version of this kind of instability was given

by Bender and Shlesinger Ref. [27] by invoking a defect-aggregation mechanism that was

recently justiﬁed [28] for PC by the pressure-dependent experiments.

In reality, strong-SCL ergodic states do not survive below Tg (see solid squares in Fig.2).

As shown in Ref. [29], this is due to the ergodic-to-nonergodic crossover from the short-

range strong liquid correlations, characteristic of solids, to somewhat long-range weak liquid

correlations, characteristic of gases. Conversely, no physical justiﬁcation was given for the

HT-VFT form introduced in Refs. [7–10]. The main aim of the current study is to provide a

physical description of the weak-SCL states on the basis of both the extended thermodynamic

AGM and the dynamic VFT equations.

The old idea that anomalous temporal (non-Debye) and anomalous temperature (non-

Arrhenius) behaviors related to the SCL relaxation, may be attributed to rearranging regions

[22], or domains [21], or droplets [20] or clusters [29] of diﬀerent size and structure, is still

widely explored and remains fruitful. There is today considerable direct evidence for the

existence of these kinds of regions. They have been observed on a microscopic scale by

multidimensional NMR, photobleaching, excess light scattering and dielectric hole burning,

as reviewed in Ref. [1], and by X-ray scattering data, discussed in Ref. [22]. The percolation

theory, improved by mesoscopic-domain energy-size scaling, as shown by Chamberlin in Ref.

[30], provided a description in detail of the observed relaxation function. An alternative

percolation-theory approach, combined with the relaxation-time cluster-size scaling law,

proposed in Ref. [32] shed light on some universal features of the primary relaxation near Tg

in the structural and orientational glasses [33]. Additional cluster-approach studies of the

dynamical spectra with accounting of the MCT scaling forms, explained the mechanisms

[34] for the primary relaxation in polymers and those of the secondary relaxation in SCLs.

Furthermore, exploration of Stauﬀer’s cluster-size scaling form, based on the percolation

theory, made it possible [29] to justify the underlying ergodic-nonergodic transition that

emerges at the ergodic crossover temperature TE (

Tg), where the cluster-size Gaussian

distribution of the strong-SCL states is transformed upon cooling into the Poisson form (see

≤

6

also discussions in Refs. [19,35]).

In the current study we extend the cluster approach to the problem of relaxation of

ergodic states in SCLs. We will demonstrate that the structural heterogenous ﬂuctuations,

being small in the case of the strong-SCL state, are responsible for moderately SCL behavior

as revealed in Refs. [7–10] by deviations from the standard VFT ﬁtting form. The paper is

organized as follows. In Sec. II we discuss phenomenological descriptions of the observed

primary relaxation timescale in terms of the known ﬁtting forms and macroscopic parameters

commonly used by experimentalists. Instead of the frequency observation windows, given

by 1/τ (exp)

T

, which are distinct for diﬀerent dynamic experiments, the timescale is introduced

through the temperature domains for the SCL excitations established with the help of the

characteristic temperatures. In Sec. III we give the dynamic and thermodynamic description

of SCLs based on the statistical approach to the rearranging regions introduced by Adam

and Gibbs. By accounting for their size ﬂuctuations, we develop extended versions for the

AGM and the VFT equations. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of the proposed

physically justiﬁed ﬁtting forms are given in Sec. IV. The conclusions are summarized in

Sec. V.

II. MACROSCOPIC PARAMETRIZATION OR THE PRIMARY RELAXATION

that establishes useful relations between the observed model parameters. It has been demon-

strated [10] that unlike the VFT form, restricted by the strong-SCL states, Eq.(5) does a

good job within the whole range of the thermally equilibrated states (see solid line in Fig.2).

The theoretical foundation of the experimental ﬁndings by Richert and Angell are not

limited by the aforesaid TD-D correspondence equation [10], i.e., T (T D)

One can see that the existence of the strongly SCL states, based on the dynamic VFT

equation and the thermodynamic AGM within observation windows, evidently requires in

the dynamic experiments and deﬁned [2] by the equation τ (exp)

g

.

T

Unlike the case of the ﬁrst TD-D equation, there is no systematic study to verify the precision

of the second equation. Except for the case of SCLs (see e.g. Fig.2 in Ref. [39]) there is even

8

no accepted international convention on the deﬁnition of the thermodynamic value T (T D)

g

for the various glass forming materials.

Furthermore, Eqs.(1, 2) cannot be extrapolated to high temperatures beyond their tem-

perature domain. Hence, the justiﬁcation given in Ref. [10] for the VFT and the ADM

corresponding macroscopic equations, i.e., B = C/∆S∞ and A = log τ (V F T )

∞

, should be re-

considered. The same equations might be introduced by application of the ergodic hypothesis

employed for SCLs in Ref. [29]. This means that the strongly SCL states, that emerge above

the crossover-ergodic-temperature TE (see Eq.(7) in Ref. [29]), can be introduced through

certain observables estimated by thermodynamic and dynamic averages. Physically, this cor-

responds to the fact that the thermally equilibrated states are equivalent to ergodic states

observed in the dynamical experiments. If this is true, this requires new equations for the

ergodic time scale and length scale given, respectively, by

In other words, Eq.(6) introduces the minimum magnitudes for temporal and size charac-

teristics necessary employed for the mesoscopic description of the SCL states.

B. Moderately Supercooled Liquids

In contrast to the second-order thermodynamic transition approach, MCT treats the

liquid-to-glass structural transformation as a dynamic process driven by liquid density ﬂuc-

tuations. In the idealized version of MCT [4] the ergodic-to-nonergodic transition occurs at

a unique crossover temperature Tc(= Tcr) at which neutron spin scattering measurements

signal the appearance of the glassy-like correlations given by the so-called non-ergodic pa-

rameter, which is analogues to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass order parameter in the

case of weak-SCL states. Moreover, the MCT predicts [4] the algebraic-type scaling for the

primary relaxation timescale, namely

τ (M CT )
T

=

τ (M CT )
∞

(T

Tc)γc

−

for Tc < Ty ≤

T < TA < Tm

(7)

with the slowing-down exponent γc. This observable is rather sensitive to the location of

Tc as well to the temperature region of the ﬁtting experimental curve [4,7,8,11,40]. The

temperature domain of Eq.(7) is much narrower than that for the case of the HT-VFT

form given [9] by TB < T < TA, where TA is the Arrhenius crossover temperature. A

temperature Ty is introduced in Eq.(7) to designate the lowest temperature point where the

algebraic MCT form ﬁts experimental data (see Fig.1). Unlike the ﬁrst estimates reported

for the slowing-down exponents that exceeded magnitudes of 5.5 in SCLs (see Table1 in Ref.

[40]), the values established by the MCT Eq.(7) in glass-forming materials are in the range,

2 < γc < 3 for liquids Eq.(7), and 3

γc < 4 for polymers. For macroscopic observable

≤

parameters of the timescale in glass forming molecular liquids and polymers see, respectively,

cases A and B in Table 1.

C. Fragility and Characteristic Temperatures

One of the salient features of the primary relaxation is the so-called time-temperature

superposition principle [4].

Its physical justiﬁcation has not yet been established but it

is employed eﬀectively to scale the dielectric loss spectra [4]. Meanwhile, analyses of a

number of the α-timescale characteristics near Tg for several experimental studies of glass

forming materials [2], have revealed a number of underlying temporal-spatial correlations in

explicit form. The analysis was given [2] in terms of the phenomenological relation, i.e.,

mg = (250

320)βg expressed through the fragility [2] mg that is related to the steepness

−

index [10], and the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) stretched exponent [1] βg.

Incorporation [32] of the growth-correlation scaling law, employed in the order-disorder

kinetic transition theory [42], into the relaxation function of the SCLs led to a description

[33] of the aforesaid temporal-spatial correlations for the dynamical exponents in a form

βg = (1+ mg/m∗

0)−1 where m∗

0 is a universal parameter (because it is material-independent)

within a certain glass family. In addition, the equation for the growth-correlation dynamic

exponent, i.e., zg = mg/3m∗

0 , was established in Ref. [33](see also proposal by Ngai in Ref.

10

Within MCT, the characteristic temperatures, as well as the dynamical exponents, are

treated as certain equilibrium thermodynamic parameters, which, as demonstrated in Ref.

[23], are not independent. This statement is exempliﬁed by the widely employed equation

follows from Eq.(8), the uncertainty in the m∗

of the straight lines in Fig. 3, is due to the uncertainty of the timescale unit parameter

τ (V F T )
∞

= τa = 10−14±1s, given by Eqs.(6), and to that of the glass-transition characteristic
g = 102±1s. Eq.(8) was ﬁrst introduced in Refs. [2,45] on the basis of the VFT

for the particular case of Eq.(9). Eq.(11), estimated at T = Tg, is known [45] as the

fragility mg that was proposed by Angell for the strong-to-fragile classiﬁcation of glass

forming materials [46]. We see that unlike the case of τ (V F T )

, the function m(V F T )

has only

T

two free parameters, T0 and Dg. Moreover, the latter can be excluded from the two-equation

system given by τ (V F T )

known Eq.(8).

As shown above, Eq.(8) is a formal consequence of the self-consistency between the VFT

equation τ (V F T )

g

and its ﬁrst derivative given by the observed fragility m(V F T )

g

. Physically, the

existence of Eq.(8) is due to the presence of the strong-SCL states at the lowest temperature

Tg parametrized by these equations. One can therefore introduce a similar relation (see Eq.8

in Ref. [23]), namely

associated with the weak-SCL states at the lowest temperature Tc. The validity of Eq.(12)

was established numerically with the universal parameter m∗

c = 107±1s. Eq.(12) was deduced [23] by application

c = 7

1 (see Fig. 2 in Ref. [23])

of the Taylor series for the steepness function (10) near Tg and Tc along with the following

assumptions: (i) in contrast to the case of the timescale τT the steepness function mT is

analytical and smooth beyond T0; and (ii) similar to the strong-SCL state, described by

m(V F T )
T

with parameters Dg and T0, the weak-SCL states can be described within the scope

of the HT-VFT form with help of m(HT )

, using D(HT )

i.e. by the formal substitution of T0 and Tg in the standard VFT equation by Tg and Tc

in the HT-VFT form, respectively. It is remarkable that the idea to introduce in Ref. [23]

the steepness function mT on the basis of the HT-VFT analytical form was stimulated by

the uncertainty of the ﬁtting analyses of τ (exp)

T

discussed by Kivelson et al.

in Ref. [11].

Experimentally, the HT-VFT form was established by the ﬁrst-order derivative analyses

given by Stickel et al. in Refs. [7–9].

The most striking consequence of the existence of the two distinct SCL states described at

Tg (in the vicinity but below Tc), respectively, by Eqs.(8) and (12) is an inference on the self-

consistency of the principal characteristic temperatures. Indeed, excluding the fragility mg

from Eqs.(8) and (12) one obtains the following characteristic-temperature equation (CTE),

(that was analyzed analytically in Ref. [23] under the model simpliﬁcation m∗

g = 2m∗

c). One

can see that beyond the scope of this simpliﬁcation, Eq.(13) includes the particular case of

the MCT ideal liquid-to-glass transition that occurs at a unique crossover temperature given

by the equation Tg = T0 = Tc.

We have shown that representation of the CTE in the form given in Eq.(13) is ensured

by application of the VFT ﬁtting forms to both the strong and the weak SCL states. On the

other hand, there exist a number of ﬁtting forms (see e.g. Refs. [27,28] and for a short review

see Ref. [1]) and therefore the question arises as to whether the fact of self-dependency of

characteristic temperatures given through the CTE is also limited by exploration of the VFT

forms.

Using the Lindeman melting criterion for the mean-square displacements of pre-transition

solid-like clusters in SCLs, Novikov et al. in Ref. [25] deduced the CTE in the ”square-root”

form: T (low)

g

= √T0Tc. Meanwhile it was shown [23] that T (low)

and the ”cubic-root” CTE,

i.e., T (up)

Odagaki proposed a controlled-diﬀusion approach to the SCL glass-transition problem in

Ref. [19]. A glass transformation process was characterized by the critical VFT temperature

T0 (= TK) and the crossover temperature Tc (= Tx) related to the peculiarities of the pseudo-

divergent α-timescale, and introduced [19] through the true divergence of the ﬁrst moment

of their distribution function. As a consequence the CTE in the form Tc∆Sc = 2Tg∆Sg was

deduced. Taking into account that the excess entropy ∆ST , given in Eq.(4), in real SCLs is

well approximated by Eq.(5), we represent here the Odagaki CTE in the following equivalent

form, namely

Again, one can see that the aforementioned MCT ideal transition is also satisﬁed by Eq.(14).

A comparative analysis of the distinct CTE form is given in Fig.4 for glass forming liquids

A. Cluster Statistics

Solid-like clusters were treated in Refs. [29,33,34] as short-range random-size correlated

regions of SCLs that permits one, at a mesoscopic level of consideration, to employ the

percolation [29,32] or controlled-diﬀusion [33,34] models. Within this context, clusters are

equivalent to solid-like domains [13,30], or droplets [20] or CRRs (cooperatively rearranging

regions) as introduced in Ref.

[14]. A more detailed speciﬁcation of clusters depends on

ways of incorporation of short-range correlations in the description of their evolution.

We treat clusters as conglomerates of z molecules [47] that are characterized at a given

temperature T and pressure p by the solid-state chemical potential µ(sol)

(p). These ﬁnite-size

T

solid-like clusters are in thermal and mechanical contact with the remaining N

z molecules,

−

which are in the normal liquid (NL) state and characterized by a chemical potential µ(liq)

(p).

T

The typical cluster, or characteristic cluster, is in dynamic equilibrium with SCL, and is

introduced by the mean-size conﬁgurational average, i.e., < z >C= zT (p) through the cluster-

size distribution function PT (p, z). For the thermally equilibrated SCL states we admit

the ergodicity hypothesis [29], i.e. the conﬁgurational averaged values are equal to those

estimated at thermodynamic equilibrium for temperatures T > Tg ≥
nonergodic transition temperature TE [29].

Solidiﬁcation, or cluster growth, if assumed at the thermal equilibrium temperature Teq, is

deﬁned by minimization of the whole system potential, that gives rise to the requirements

imposed on the chemical potentials, i.e., µ(sol)

eq = µ(liq)

eq

, and on the entropies, with S(sol)

eq <

S(liq)
eq

, given at T = Teq (see e.g. Fig. 15 and discussion in Ref. [48]). Stabilization of

the liquid-solid boundary upon decrease of temperature below the equilibrium temperature

is also ensured by minimization of the whole Gibbs potential and therefore by positivity

of the excess chemical potential, i.e., ∆µT = µ(sol)

µ(liq)
T > 0 and the mesoscopic-scale

conﬁgurational entropy, i.e., ∆ST (z) = S(liq)

(N

(z) > 0 at T < Teq (hereafter we

omit the pressure p as an irrelevant parameter). Note that the macroscopic conﬁguration

entropy introduced by Eq.(4) is deﬁned here as ∆ST =< ∆ST (z) >C. The latter is also

expected to be valid far from thermodynamic equilibrium.

Within the ﬂuctuation mechanism for the formation of heterogeneous clusters, the prob-

ability for the formation of a solid cluster of size z, is formally given by the probability

PT (z)dz that the thermodynamic variable z lies between z and z + dz. This probability is

driven by the temperature-dependent whole-system entropy [49], namely

Here the characteristic cluster of size zT is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the thermal

bath, and therefore the entropy of the whole system ST (z) = S(sol)

T + S(liq)

T + S(mix)

T

(which

includes the solid-liquid mixing term S(mix)

−
notable that the real SCLs, studied in dynamic experiments, are not close to thermodynamic

Teq. It is

≈

equilibrium, but the Gaussian size-distribution function PT (z) of Eq. (15) was experimentally

tested and justiﬁed by Chamberlin et al. in Refs. [30,35] for a number of SCLs.

Let us treat the formation of a cluster of size z at ﬁxed pressure p and temperature

15

T as an isobaric-isothermal ﬂuctuation process. This means that solid-like clusters are not

in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ﬂuid, i.e., T < Teq, (T refers to the solid-state

subsystem and Teq to the thermal bath) but they appear and disappear from a ﬂuid volume
of size z with a CRR frequency τ −1

T (z), where τT (z) is the lifetime of a z-cluster. The

probability of formation of this kind of cluster is given by τ −1

T (z) and is determined from

Onsager’s principle, i.e. by the aforesaid mesoscopic size-scale entropy ∆ST (z), namely

Here Wmin = ∆GT (z) corresponds to the minimum work (see e.g. Eqs.(20.8) and (114.1)

of Ref. [48]) required for solidiﬁcation of z molecules driven by cluster-size ﬂuctuations.

Within the isobaric-isothermal mechanism, proposed by Adam and Gibbs [14], one has

∆GT (z) = (µ(sol)

non-equilibrium states with T

Teq through the relation

≈

τT (z) = τa exp

∆µT z

(cid:18)
which introduces the cluster mesoscopic-scale relaxation time. This in turn is related to the

(cid:19)

observed macroscopic timescale, namely

τT ≡

< τT (z) >C=

τT (z)PT (z)dz.

Within the proposed cluster statistical treatment, the corresponding macroscopic lengthscale

is given by

zT ≡

< z >C=

zPT (z)dz.

On one hand, these two scales, experimentally justiﬁed above the glass transition temper-

ature, are ensured by the thermodynamic-dynamic correspondence principle. On the other

hand, the cluster-formation mechanism, speciﬁed by PT (z) through the observables given in

Eqs.(18) and (19), should satisfy the constraints that are naturally required by the macro-

scopic and mesoscopic scales. In other words, the observables should obey the conditions

τT > τ (min)

= τa and zT > z(min)

B. Adam-Gibbs Model

The Adam-Gibbs molecular-kinetic theory [14] was based on Eq.(16) given for the coop-

erative transition probability for rearranging regions of z molecules with the minimum work

W (AG)

min = ∆µ(AG)z that was estimated for the isobaric-isothermal ensemble of equivalent

thermodynamic subsystems, where ∆µ(AG) is a solid-over-liquid excess chemical potential,

approximated by a constant. The average transition probability 1/τ (AG)

follows from the

T

AGM macroscopic timescale, namely

The smallest CRR of a ”critical size” z(AG)

T

, that still permits a transition, corresponds to

the lowest critical conﬁgurational entropy for one CCR, s∗

c = kB ln 2, introduced as the ﬁrst

estimate in Ref. [14]. The conﬁgurational entropy Sc(T ) of the whole system given in Eqs.

(4) and (5) for one mole of the SCL (N = NA), consists of NA/z(AG)

T

of self-similar smallest

CRRs and is therefore estimated here as

Sc(T ) = s∗

c

z(AG)

.

One can see that Eq.(21) is equivalent to Eq.(20) in Ref. [14]. Eqs.(20) and (21) deduced

above result in the known Eq.(1) with the AGM parameters, namely

A = log10 τ (AG)

∞ and C =

∆µ(AG)NAs∗

c

.

Note that the AGM was motivated to validate the phenomenological Williams-Landel-Ferry

ﬁtting form that in a way is equivalent to the VFT form.

Adopting the aforesaid TD-D correspondence established between the AGM and the

VFT form given by Eq.(2), and with the help of Eqs.(5) and (20), we introduce the primary

relaxation lengthscale through the relations

The CRR size-temperature behavior given by z(exp)

was experimentally studied for SCLs

[50] and for orientational-glass plastic crystals in Refs. [51,52]. These studies as well as the

ﬁndings of Ref. [10], both based on the AGM, clearly indicate that Eq.(23), and also Eq.(5),

do good a job within the whole SCL ergodic temperature range, i.e., at T

Tg (see e.g. Fig.

≥

4 in Ref. [51] and Fig. 3 in Ref. [10]). This permits one to present the experimental result for

the excess isobaric heat capacity ∆C (exp)

entropy in Eq.(5), in the following equivalent form:

With the help of Eq.(4) one arrives at a new useful relation for the observed model parameter

The standard error function that emerges in Eq.(27) is bounded by one, and although it

modiﬁes the pre-exponential factor τa, it does not substantially modify the exponential

temperature dependence of τT . Furthermore, the error-function term will be absorbed by

τa.

We see that the VFT form of Eq.(27), when extended by cluster-size ﬂuctuations, has

the form of a high-T thermodynamic perturbation series. The ﬁrst and second terms in

the exponent describe the rigid solid clusters and their ﬂuctuation corrections, respectively.

The ﬁrst term matches the rigid-cluster relaxation time given by the VFT equation and the

AGM solution given by Eq.(9) and Eq.(20), respectively. The TD-D correspondence is now

extended at a mesoscopic level that permits one to establish the physical meaning of the

macroscopical phenomenological parameters for the strong-SCL states, namely

B(SL) =

(29)

under the additional condition ∆µg = ∆µ(AG) along with Eq.(6).

Unlike the case of the thermodynamic AGM, which gives a good description [10] of all the

SCL states (see Fig.2) within the ergodic temperature domain, Tg ≤
that C = C (SL) = C (M L) in Eq.(1)), the VFT form fails [7–9] to describe weak SCL states

into the α-timescale parametrized by the observed MCT parameters (τ (M CT )

us represent the exponential form (27) in the asymptotically equivalent algebraic form given

by Eq.(7). Using exp [c (1 + x)]

at a physical restriction γc > 2 that is in accord with experimental data. As a result, the

primary relaxation through the timescale steepness and curvature.

IV. STEEPNESS FUNCTION ANALYSIS

20

A. Qualitative Analysis

We discuss two scenarios of relaxation of the SCLs observed in thermodynamic and

dynamic experiments and shown in Fig. 2. The thermodynamic version is given by the AGM

that describes the conﬁgurational entropy data within the whole SCL ergodic range (shown

by solid squares in Fig.2). Within the context of percolation treatment, the solid clusters are

apparently the same for the strongly and moderately SCL states, i.e., z(SL)

a = z(M L)

a

(= z(AG)
∞ )

and thermal ﬂuctuations are negligible (∆z(AG)

T

= 0). The AGM excess chemical potential

is approximated by a constant given at Tg, i.e., ∆µ(AG) = ∆µg.

To describe the primary relaxation timescale observed in the dynamic experiments, we

start from the trial estimate given by the thermodynamic approximation. This is formally

introduced by SCL-system clusters with z(SCL)

a

= z(AG)

∞ = za, but with ∆z(SCL)

T

= 0, that

corresponds to an extension of the AGM by cluster-size ﬂuctuations, which strictly speaking

are not observed in real thermodynamic experiments. Meanwhile the trial dynamic time-

scale steepness function follows from Eqs.(10) and (35), namely

where the auxiliary timescale function εT is given in Eq.(9). In order to employ the timescale

parametrization in terms of the observed fragility mg, we apply Eq.(36) at T = Tg. Using the

relation za = kBT0γcεc/∆µc, one excludes the unknown parameter za. By solving Eq.(36),

with respect to the MCT parameter γc, one obtains the trial estimate given by

that was analyzed in detail in Ref. [29]. Here we consider Eq.(37) as the quadratic equation

with respect to the unknown factor ∆µg/∆µc. This enables one to calculate the rebuilding

energy per molecule near the crossover temperature, namely

c = 1 adopted, respectively, for liquids and poly-

mers. We see that no rebuilding chemical potential eﬀects are found for the case of glass

forming polymers. This can be understood as follows. In contrast to the case of molecular

liquids, where application of the ergodic cluster description by the Gaussian distribution

given in Eq.(15) is justiﬁed both physically and experimentally, the monomeric-segment

polymers require accounting of their fractal structure even for their ergodic states [29].

The dynamic relaxation scenario given by the VFT equation is realized through rigid

clusters as well as by the VFT equation extended by the cluster-size ﬂuctuations (VFTE

equation) and applied, respectively, to the strong and weak SCL states. The relevant steep-

ness function follows immediately from the corresponding relaxation times. Hence with help

of Eq.(34), one has

Qualitatively, the ﬁrst-order derivative analyses of experimental data by Stickel et al.,

given in Refs. [7,8] points to the existence of a small kink of the steepness function near the

crossover temperature Tc (see Fig.1) [54]. Formally, this means that the limit of the timescale

steepness function from below (T

Application of these limits to Eqs.(39) and (40) using the relation Dc = γcεc, that follows

The dynamic conditions given in Eq.(41) reﬂect the observed [7,8] dynamical crossover from

moderately to strong SCLs near Tc that are associated with the dynamic reconstruction of

the cluster lengthscale. To provide deeper insight into the problem we will reproduce below

the ﬁtting derivative analyses by Stickel et al. within the VFT and VFTE equations.

B. Numerical Analysis

1. First-Order Derivative Timescale Steepness

The ﬁrst-order derivative analysis of the temperature behavior of the timescale was given

in Refs. [7,8] with the help of a ﬁrst-order derivative function, namely

)2, with F (exp)

found by Stickel et al. by ﬁtting with m(SL)

and m(M L)

.

T

T

1T

1T

The latter are given, respectively, in Eq.(39) and Eq.(40), with the strength indices Dg

and Dc treated as adjustable parameters within the corresponding temperature regions,

T < Tc and Tc ≤

Tg ≤
in Table 3. Unlike the case of Figs. 5, where the VFT temperature T0 is treated as the

T < Tm, respectively. The results of ﬁtting analyses are accumulated

same for the both states, the SCLs analyzed in Fig. 6 are in conﬂict with the canonical VFT

form for the strongly SCL states, but this is in accord with analysis given in Refs. [7,8,10].

In this case the critical temperature T0 is not established and is therefore treated as an

additional adjustable parameter for description of the moderately SCL states through the

23

VFTE equation. Thereby, we follow the idea that the Kauzmann temperature T0 might be

established beyond the VFT equation.

Our quantitative analysis of the strong-to-moderate-state crossover is in accord with

the qualitative predictions given by Eq.(41). As seen from Table 3, the typical change in

the ratio of strength indices Dg/Dc lies between 4 and 6. Exceptions should be given for

the ”irregular” case of salol where the Kauzmann temperature established by the VFTE

equation (T0 = 200K) is rather diﬀerent from those established by other methods and given

in Table 1.

Adopting the trial estimate for the moderate-to-strong SCL-state crossover for the ex-

cess chemical potential, given in Table 2, one arrives at the length-scale ratio estimate

z(SL)
a

/z(M L)
a

= 3.7

−

4.7. We see that the observed crossover, associated with the cluster

reconstruction, is not caused solely by decrease of cluster-size ﬂuctuations and/or by growth

of their chemical potentials. This crossover is accompanied by the lengthscale extension,

i.e., z(SL)

a > z(M L)

a

.

2. Second-Order Derivative Timescale Curvature

The second-order timescale derivative-ﬁtting analysis introduced by Stickel et al. can

be treated as experimental observation of the critical temperature T0 through the VFT

form. This analysis was done [7,8] with the help of the second-order derivative function

form was derived [8] in Figs. 8 and 11. Remarkably, in all cases the assumed kink in the

function F (exp)

near Tc was transformed into the evident jump of the function F (exp)

that leads to an expression for k(M L)

with the help of Eq.(44). The typical SCL timescale cur-

vatures are exempliﬁed by PC and salol given in, Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively. We see that

both cases are distinct and that the moderately SCL states are consistent with the cluster-

size ﬂuctuation description, based on the idea of the existence of a unique thermodynamic-

instability temperature TK = T0. They are described by the VFTE timescale equation (35)

with the same model parameters established in the steepness timescale analysis given in

Fig. 5A and 6A, respectively, for PC and salol. Conversely, in the case of salol and PDE, our

attempts failed [55] to the describe the strongly SCL states through the observed curvature

with the help of various VFT-type ﬁtting forms reviewed in Ref. [1], including the proposal

given in Refs. [27,28]. Accounting for the aforesaid TD-D correspondence, we speculate that

the failure of the standard VFT equation in the salol-type SCLs (that should be extended by

the case of BMPC (see Fig.6C)), is due to the inapplicability of the cluster description given

by the thermodynamic model of Adam and Gibbs in Ref. [14]. Indeed, as shown above,

the main AGM constraint for the excess chemical potential, i.e., ∆µT = ∆µc, works well

above the SL-ML crossover temperature, but below Tc it needs to be reconsidered for the

salol-type SCLs.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The investigation of the temperature behavior of the primary relaxation timescale in

SCLs plays a fundamental role in understanding the glass transition problem in general,

as widely discussed in various, microscopically distinct, glass forming non-solid materials.

In spite of the fact that the nature of the structural glass transformations is essentially

dynamical, the process of solidiﬁcation of rearranging regions, while avoiding crystallization

of a given SCL as a whole system, exhibits many features of the common liquid-to-solid or

disorder-to-order true thermodynamic phase transitions.

The ”pure” dynamic treatment of the glass-transition problem, given by the simpliﬁed

MCT version, and the ”pure” thermodynamic treatment given by the simpliﬁed AGM, are

limited in the description of the primary relaxation timescale temperature behavior. This

limitation was revealed by the temperature derivative analyses given by Stickel et al., as

shown in Fig.1, that clearly establish that the ﬁtting forms for the known τ (M CT )

T

and τ (AG)
T

(given, respectively, in Eqs.(7) and (34)), ﬁt the data only for a restricted temperature

window.

The same kind of restriction applies to the analysis of the thermodynamic models [12,13]

mentioned in the Introduction, which oﬀer a similar overall τT description within the whole

range of existence of the ergodic SCL states. Although these models seem to provide a good

ﬁt to τ (exp)

T

(by using only one adjustable parameter, as the fragility mg in the case of Ref.

[12], or by using more than three adjustable model parameters, as in the case of Ref. [11]),

they need to be analyzed by considering the derivative functions of the dynamical variables

over the full temperature range.

As stressed by Angell et al.

in Ref. [1], the popularity of the thermodynamic AGM

among molecular-liquid phenomenologists might be compared with that of exploring the

phenomenological VFT form by glass-material experimentalists. The current study develops

a statistical approach for the description of CRRs, with their isobaric-isothermal mechanism

of solidiﬁcation that were introduced a long time ago by Adam and Gibbs in Ref. [14].

26

The application of the second-order derivative analysis for the case of salol, revealed

[7] that the widely used standard VFT form given in Eq.(16) has no observation window.

This observation ended the unreserved domination of the phenomenological VFT form for

ﬁtting all dynamical data of all SCLs, and divided the SCLs in two groups, ”regular” and

”irregular”, that, respectively, obey or do not obey the VFT equation. Meanwhile, it seems

that all SCLs exhibit a jump in the timescale curvature near Tc (see e.g. Figs. 7 and 8)

related to the corresponding kink observed in the temperature behavior of the timescale-

steepness that separates the glass forming liquids into two dynamically distinct states (see

e.g. Figs. 5 and 6). Additionally, both the ”regular” and ”irregular” SCLs, therefore manifest

the absolute thermodynamic instability at the Kauzmann temperature TK, whose physical

meaning is extended by the equation TK = T0.

We have discussed the SCLs in ergodic states in terms of isolated ﬁnite-size solid-like

clusters observed within the window Tg ≤

T < Tm in the dynamic experiments through the

. The cluster dynamics, introduced by the Gaussian

size-distribution cluster statistics and exponential-type size-relaxation, described by Eqs.(15)

and (17), respectively, is driven by the mesoscopic entropy and ensured by the Onsager

thermodynamic principle.

Below the crossover temperature Tc, the CRRs emerges as structurally homogeneous

clusters, where thermodynamic stability is guaranteed by the growth of the excess chemical

potential ∆µg (> ∆µc). This energetic change, associated with the cluster rebuilding, is

justiﬁed experimentally through the analysis given in Table 2A. In turn, the homogeneous

clusters are associated with the strong SCL states of the MCT, and/or with percolation

theory solid-like clusters described by the VFT equation (with the activation energy E(SL)

The experimental observation [10] of the strong-SCL ergodic states, described simulta-

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

neously by the thermodynamic AGM and the dynamic VFT equations led to formulation

27

of the thermodynamic-dynamic glass-transition correspondence principle. This principle is

based on the physically intelligible thermodynamic-dynamic equations introduced for the

critical T0 and glass transition Tg temperatures, as well as on the ergodic hypothesis that

gives rise to the temporal and spatial scale minima introduced in Eq.(6). These scales are

common for both dynamic and thermodynamic experiments within the temperature domain

T < Tc. Upon cooling near and below Tg, the cluster size z(SL)

and its heteroge-

grow and the SL clusters show an ergodic instability caused by

their maximum ﬂuctuations [29]. The compact ”ergodic” solid-like SL clusters are there-

fore transformed into fractal-type clusters of the holey-like (approximated by the ideal gas

[27,29]) structure that is accompaniment by expansion of the relevant percolation lattice,

with ζb > ζ (SL)

a

. Upon heating, the CRRs of the AGM disappear in the dynamic experi-

ments above Tc but remain stable in calorimetric thermally equilibrated experiments (see

Fig.2). Moreover, as follows from the ﬁrst and second order T -derivative analyses elaborated

in Refs. [7,8,10,55], the SL-cluster description given with the help of the VFT-type forms

is not useful for ”irregular” SCLs such as salol, PDE, and BMPC (see also steepness and

curvature analyses in Figs.6A and 8, Fig.6B, and Fig.6C, respectively).

Unlike the SL states, the structurally heterogeneous clusters, denominated as ML clusters,

exhibit stability in all studied SCLs. They are associated with excitations of the weak

supercooled states, characteristic of the moderately SCLs within the domain Tc ≤
and introduced by the VFTE equation with the correlation length z(M L)

Due to the common physical restriction imposed on ﬂuctuations, which preserve the ML-

cluster structure and given by ∆z(M L)

< 1, one naturally arrives at the constraint for

the timescale slowing-down exponent, i.e., γc > 2.

The minimum size of the ML clusters derived from the dynamical experimental data (see

Table 3) is related to the instability of heterogeneous clusters below the crossover tempera-

ture Tc that results in an expansion of the underlying percolation lattice, i.e., ζ (SL)

a > ζ (M L)

a

.

28

We see that within the context of percolation theory, the discussed cluster reconstructions

near Tg and Tc are geometrically similar and therefore the crossover temperature Tc for the

moderately SCL states plays a role similar to the ”crossover” temperature Tg for the strong

SCL states. This clariﬁes the eﬀectiveness of the phenomenological HT-VFT ﬁtting form

introduced on the basis of the VFT equation with relevant substitution of the characteristic

temperatures discussed in Eq.(12).

It has been justiﬁed experimentally (see analyses in Figs. 5-8 ) that the size ﬂuctuations

of the ML clusters, as ”non-rigid” solid-like precursors of the SL clusters, grow upon the

decrease of the temperature. This means that the ML clusters are characterized more

as ”ﬂuid-like” rather than ”solid-like” and hence might be introduced on the basis of the

thermodynamic heterophase-ﬂuctuation microscopic model proposed by Fischer and Bakai

in Ref. [22]. According to this model, the ML clusters may be associated with isolated liquid-

like droplets that show small heterophase ﬂuctuations. Upon cooling, the concentration of

the solid fraction grows and the liquid droplets exhibit a crossover from isolated to non-

isolated long-range density ﬂuctuations [56], related to Fischer clusters that eventually do

not contribute to the primary relaxation. As seen from Fig. 5 in Ref. [22], for the case of

salol, the droplet percolation crossover temperature is close to Tc, i.e. to that predicted by

the MCT. The question therefore arises as to whether the interpercolation droplet states,

given by the Gibbs potential in Eq.(2.1) in Ref. [22], enable one to describe the drastic

temperature behavior observed for the timescale curvature [7] in the window Tg ≤
Tc (see Fig.8). Furthermore, one can speculate that the thermodynamic-dynamic glass-

T <

transformation correspondence above Tc, can be established on the basis of the physical

correspondence between the thermodynamic heterophase-ﬂuctuation droplet model [22] and

the dynamic VFTE equation given for τ (M L)

in Eq.(35).

T

One can expect that application of the derivative analysis by ﬁtting the timescale steep-

ness and curvature, in addition to the common τ (exp)

T

ﬁtting, might serve as a reliable in-

strument to give new insights into important features of the underlying physical processes.

This is related to the weak–to-strong SCL-state crossover based on the existence of the

29

observation windows and the steepness kink discussed above in Eqs.(6) and (41), respec-

tively. We exemplify our statement by the Schulz model (SM) [12] that employs the concept

of Goldstein’s energy landscape for SCLs. The overall ergodic-range timescale [12] can

be represented here by the activation energy E(SM )

T

= Em(Tm/T )γg where Em and γg are

thermodynamic parameters (with γg = 1 + 2∆c(SM )/3kB , given in Eq.(26) in Ref. [12] in

terms of the excess liquid-over-HT-solid isobaric speciﬁc heat capacity ∆c(SM )

g

). Ignoring the

weakly T -dependent pre-exponential factor, one can estimate the steepness function deﬁned

in Eq.(10) at Tg, i.e., the fragility mg. Similar to the case of the VFT form, discussed on the

basis of Eq.(8), one can solve the system of the two equations for mg and τg with respect to

Em and γg. This process results in the following expression for the slowing-down exponent,
γg = mg/m∗

g , and oﬀers a new equation for the Schulz model excess heat capacity, namely

∆c(SM )
g

=

3
2

(

mg

(46)

We have thereby demonstrated, along with the ﬁndings given in Eq.(13) and analyzed in

Fig.4 (for the self-consistent characteristic temperatures) and in Eq.(25) (for the observed

excess entropy ∆S∞), how the steepness timescale analysis can be used to verify the self-

consistency of the model predictions. Both model Eqs.(25) and (46) need further testing.

We also speculate on the existence of some alternative mathematical forms for the

timescale τT , whose cluster-size singular behavior near T0 is suﬃciently aﬀected by the

excess chemical potential ∆µT .

Indeed, in the current study, the macroscopic primary

relaxation timescale is introduced by the mesoscopic solid-like clusters with rearranging

frequency ω(cl)

T (z)

τ −1
T (z) = τa exp(

≡

−

∆µT z/kBT ) (see Eq.(17)). An alternative descrip-

tion of the random mesoscopic rearranging regions was proposed by Odagaki in Ref. [19]

on the basis of the AGM treated within the controlled-diﬀusion approach. Formally, the

rearranging regions in SCLs were introduced as random domains deﬁned by the random

excess chemical potential ∆µ and by the characteristic size z(AG)

that follows from Eq.(21)

T

given by the AGM. The domain rearranging frequency was therefore treated as a random

value ω(dom)

(∆µ) = τ −1

d exp(

∆µ z/kBT ) where both ∆µ and z are random

a exp(

T (∆µ, z) = τ −1

candidate to solve the problem of the primary relaxation observed in the salol-type SCLs.

Finally, we have demonstrated how the primary relaxation scale can be described by the

two VFT and VFTE equations and parameterized by a ﬁnite number of observables: three

principal characteristic temperatures T0, Tg and Tc; the fragility mg; the slowing-down expo-

nent γc; and the two strength indices D(SL) = ∆µgz(SL)

given in Eqs.(39) and (40), respectively. Physically, this description is justiﬁed by the sta-

bilization of the strong and weak SCL states, realized through stabilization of the temporal

and spatial scales, and related to the minimum time and size of the rearranging regions. This

proposed approach is elaborated with the help of a set of ”universal parameters” m∗
